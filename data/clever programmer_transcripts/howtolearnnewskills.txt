00:00 - hey guys what's up this is Kazi from
00:02 - clever programmer calm and one of the
00:04 - questions that I get so commonly is how
00:07 - do you learn something very quickly and
00:09 - become skilled at it the secret about
00:17 - that is making learning into play
00:20 - think about how anybody or anything gets
00:22 - good at a skill think about even a
00:25 - little cub lion how they get good it is
00:28 - in the start they just play around they
00:30 - feel things out and over time to start
00:32 - developing better skills for them it's
00:35 - in hunting it's in scouting and being
00:36 - able to see really far for them it's in
00:38 - running surviving skills but for us
00:41 - somebody who's learning to code it could
00:43 - be in becoming a better coder becoming a
00:45 - better programmer one mistake that I see
00:47 - a lot of people make is that they want
00:49 - to stick to the script if you're
00:51 - following a tutorial you'll literally
00:53 - follow every exact step by step in the
00:55 - tutorial and they will never deviate
00:57 - from that example to try to turn it into
00:59 - their own example something that helped
01:01 - me the most was actually taking snippets
01:04 - of tutorials and then just deviating
01:06 - into my own world creating something
01:08 - from just the first few lines of the
01:10 - tutorial that I was following that was
01:12 - my own and that could actually help me
01:14 - in my life when I started learning Java
01:16 - or when I started learning Python in the
01:18 - beginning days I would create these
01:19 - little things that could help me
01:21 - calculate my paycheck I would just be
01:22 - like okay 30 days of cause ease time
01:24 - what's the return one week of cause ease
01:26 - time what's the return on that and
01:28 - that's something you can do as well but
01:30 - make sure that if you're doing something
01:32 - and you're following and you're learning
01:34 - more time should actually be spent
01:36 - outside of just what you're being taught
01:38 - and you should be exploring playing
01:40 - around with it and just making it play
01:42 - really getting the feel for it so invest
01:45 - the time in just learning invest the
01:48 - time in making something play because
01:51 - realistically that's one of the best
01:54 - ways you are going to get better that's
01:56 - one of the best ways you're going to
01:58 - pick up more skills and become skilled
02:01 - in a very short amount of time right and
02:03 - again I say this as somebody who
02:06 - understands the psychology of hundreds
02:07 - of thousands of students that I've
02:09 - worked with one-on-one whether it be
02:11 - teaching them computer programming
02:13 - whether
02:13 - be teaching them chess or table tennis
02:15 - or whatever else and I'm also speaking
02:17 - from a perspective of somebody who
02:19 - became top 1% in the world of chess
02:23 - somebody who became better at computer
02:25 - programming and there's nothing special
02:27 - about me I didn't have a 4.0 GPA in high
02:30 - school I didn't have a 4.0 GPA in
02:32 - college I didn't have the best ACC
02:35 - scores and know I was not a math genius
02:37 - but those things that have helped me
02:39 - make my skills so good is I never just
02:43 - did what I was assigned to do I never
02:45 - just did the bare minimum and did
02:47 - exactly what it said in the script I
02:49 - took those examples made them up my own
02:51 - and ultimately turn it into play that's
02:55 - it for this video guys thank you guys so
