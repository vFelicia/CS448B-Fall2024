00:00 - hey you what is up how's it going this
00:02 - is Kazi from clever programmer calm here
00:05 - in Colombia heading in shooting from
00:08 - Pablo Escobar's mansion which is super
00:09 - dope but what I wanted to talk about
00:10 - today with you guys is the difference
00:13 - between begging for an income versus
00:15 - actually earning an income so with
00:17 - that's that let's jump right into it
00:21 - [Music]
00:30 - one of the cool things that I saw after
00:33 - I came into Columbia which I thought was
00:35 - really cool and should be mentioned is
00:37 - that a lot of the red lights here are
00:39 - pretty entertaining at least what I saw
00:41 - in MIDI and so for example most of the
00:43 - times when I'm in Chicago or LA at
00:44 - stoplights a bunch of times you just
00:46 - have people actually begging you know
00:47 - and they want some food they want some
00:49 - money whatever which is fine however one
00:52 - of the things that I thought was really
00:53 - cool here is that every light you have
00:56 - people who are essentially entertainers
00:58 - so they will come out every red light
00:59 - they'll jump in front of you and it'll
01:01 - be a group of them and they'll be
01:02 - dancing or they're gonna be like doing
01:04 - juggling we saw this one guy and he's
01:07 - spinning a ball put it on an umbrella
01:08 - spinning it there and then like juggling
01:10 - at the same time that was happening so I
01:12 - thought that was pretty freaking epic
01:15 - now after that happened he goes and
01:17 - collects money from the people who are
01:18 - the red light so somebody actually
01:20 - begging versus earning an income you
01:23 - know these people instead of their
01:25 - instead of just them begging their like
01:26 - hey we're gonna actually do something to
01:27 - entertain people and then what happens
01:30 - is you go and you actually pay them and
01:32 - you're happy to pay them because you're
01:34 - like this was kind of cool it was like
01:36 - my own private show in this place now
01:39 - comparing that to the job market and how
01:42 - we as programmers apply to jobs in
01:45 - places a lot of times it looks like this
01:47 - we go to a college we get a degree and
01:50 - then essentially after that we kind of
01:52 - just start begging for jobs for an
01:55 - income for either a salary or a clients
01:58 - however if we were more like the people
02:01 - who actually provide value before asking
02:04 - for anything juggling to entertain you
02:07 - dancing right if you could provide value
02:10 - to your client before you're always just
02:12 - like asking for money and asking for an
02:14 - income it would be much more likely to
02:16 - get a job and those people that actually
02:19 - hire you will be happy to pay you so I
02:22 - want you to start adapting that mindset
02:24 - of begging versus earning in your
02:27 - lifestyle and always look to provide
02:29 - value first when you do that people will
02:32 - happily be your client hi
02:35 - you give you a chance for an interview
02:37 - get you on that coffee or 15 minutes
02:40 - they give you time to actually pitch
02:41 - them and you'll see a lot more
02:43 - opportunity come your way so would
02:45 - that's that I wanted to keep this video
02:47 - simple and short give you one takeaway
02:49 - that's my takeaway that I want to give
02:51 - you if you thought this video was
02:53 - awesome please leave a comment and let
02:55 - me know what did you think what would be
02:57 - that one tip that you would give to
02:59 - somebody or you would you know which of
03:01 - these things do you think are applicable
03:02 - to you and like the video give it a
03:05 - thumbs up and subscribe to the channel
