00:00 - - Hey guys, what's up?
00:01 - This is Qazi from CleverProgrammer.com,
00:03 - and today I got four most important tips
00:06 - for computer programming beginners.
00:09 - So let's jump right into it.
00:12 - (bass-heavy R&B music)
00:17 - Tip number one, syntax.
00:22 - This is one of the most common complaints
00:24 - I get from everybody.
00:26 - I get hundreds of messages from students,
00:29 - and they always need help with their code.
00:32 - And whenever I kind of look at it,
00:34 - it's always a little syntax
mistake that they made.
00:38 - What do I mean by that?
00:40 - What I mean by that is they
meant to write forward,
00:44 - like turtle.forward,
00:46 - but they ended up writing turtle.foward.
00:49 - So they didn't spell forward correctly.
00:54 - Or they forgot to put a little colon
00:56 - at the end of the if statement.
00:58 - Or they forgot to put a parenthesis
01:00 - where a parenthesis goes.
01:02 - And a lot of the times I see this,
01:04 - they're following my videos.
01:05 - Like, you might actually be
following my video tutorial
01:08 - and you might make this mistake.
01:10 - And it's totally okay
because I make this mistake.
01:13 - I mean, even today I make
these syntax mistakes.
01:16 - But especially when I started,
01:18 - I used to make them all the time.
01:20 - So before you jump on and ask for help,
01:22 - make sure that you're paying attention
01:25 - to how you are actually
writing your code, okay?
01:30 - So I know it seems like it's below you
01:31 - and it's so simple, but trust me.
01:34 - Make yourself kind of dumb
when it comes to these things
01:37 - and really pay attention,
01:38 - because you might be missing
this a lot more than you think
01:41 - and you might be making
those simple syntax mistakes.
01:44 - And a lot of the times, it'll
lead to crazy frustration.
01:47 - Like, some of the students actually said,
01:48 - "I don't think I can do programming.
01:50 - "I think I should quit."
01:51 - Like, literally one of the
students said that to me,
01:54 - and the problem with his code
01:55 - was actually him writing F-O-W-A-R-D
01:58 - instead of F-O-R-W-A-R-D.
02:02 - Okay, so syntax, very important.
02:05 - Make sure you follow it.
02:07 - It seems simple, but pay
extra attention to it.
02:11 - That's tip number one.
02:13 - Tip number two.
02:18 - KISS, keep it simple stupid.
02:21 - Don't try to get fancy with your code.
02:24 - Like for example, with Codecademy
02:26 - or some of these other websites,
02:28 - they're great learning resources,
02:30 - but a lot of the times...
02:33 - Just 'cause you're hitting
those bullet points
02:35 - and covering those concepts,
02:37 - like the title might say
Covering Bitwise Operators
02:40 - or Covering Object-Oriented Programming,
02:43 - and there might actually
be one lesson on it.
02:46 - Don't think you're an expert on that
02:48 - and don't downplay some
of the simple things.
02:51 - Don't be like, "Oh yeah, I
already know if-then statements.
02:54 - "I don't need to learn them anymore."
02:56 - You can learn if-then
statements infinitely
02:58 - and they get infinitely complex.
03:01 - Another thing, functions.
03:02 - Super, super, super important,
03:04 - but so many times when I tell people like,
03:07 - "Hey, work on your problem solving skills
03:09 - "and really understand how functions work,
03:11 - "and really understand the basics."
03:13 - And they'll be like, "Oh no,
03:14 - "I've already been past it.
03:16 - "I've been even past bitwise operators."
03:18 - Just 'cause you've covered
that title and that headline,
03:21 - it doesn't mean that all
the concepts that go into it
03:24 - and all the main things,
you're done with them.
03:27 - That's actually like, 99%
of a programmer's job,
03:31 - writing basic-looking code but it ends up
03:34 - getting very complex
at the end of the day.
03:36 - So keep it simple and focus
on the most simple things,
03:41 - and get very, very good at them.
03:44 - Alright, moving onto tip number three.
03:50 - Make learning play.
03:52 - I've said this in many of my other videos,
03:54 - but I just cannot stress this enough.
03:57 - Make it play.
03:59 - Take whatever concepts you're learning
04:01 - and just play with them.
04:03 - Some of the students who
are getting the best results
04:05 - from following my courses
04:07 - have been the students who
made up their own examples.
04:11 - Just yesterday in the
Learn Python OOP course,
04:14 - one of the students in the Slack channel,
04:18 - using object-oriented programming,
04:21 - created this little game
with somebody shooting a gun
04:24 - and then having an option to reload.
04:26 - So kind of like how you would actually see
04:28 - in a game like Call Of Duty,
04:30 - there's a reload option, there's an option
04:33 - to kind of change the
gun that you're using
04:36 - or the skin of it,
04:38 - and you can add on more and more things.
04:40 - And nowhere in the course
have I taught that.
04:43 - I've taught you other
things that you can do,
04:45 - but he took it, ran with it,
04:48 - created his own implications, and had fun.
04:52 - Literally some of the students
04:53 - who are taking courses at CleverProgrammer
04:56 - or following the YouTube
channel or whatever
04:58 - are ahead of some of the students
05:00 - who are taking masters-level
courses at universities.
05:04 - How do I know?
05:06 - Well, because I have students
that I personally coach
05:09 - who are actually going for their masters
05:11 - in Python, data analytics,
computer science, you name it.
05:15 - Some of those students are at UFC.
05:18 - Some of those students
are going to UIC, as well.
05:22 - And I'm working with those
students and they are,
05:27 - they're given so much homework,
05:29 - they're given so many
assignments, so many projects,
05:31 - and then they have a busy life
05:32 - and whatever else they're
doing in their life,
05:35 - that they don't have time to make it play.
05:37 - So what do they do?
05:38 - They end up focusing on regurgitation.
05:40 - And by regurgitation,
I mean literally like,
05:42 - hearing whatever is being taught to you
05:46 - and you just kind of repeat it, right?
05:48 - And that's what they're doing.
05:50 - They're copying and pasting
code from Stack Overflow,
05:52 - and they're not taking the liberty
05:54 - to actually learn, to actually play.
05:57 - And they think they're very
advanced and very far ahead,
06:00 - but I swear if I gave them
to do a simple project
06:03 - they will just be completely lost.
06:05 - They're gonna need to go
on different websites,
06:08 - copy and paste code, and
have zero understanding
06:11 - of what they're doing to
actually make it work.
06:15 - Sometimes I get frustrated
when I'm working with them,
06:17 - but I have to understand
from their perspective.
06:20 - They have a ton of work,
06:21 - and they don't have the luxury of time
06:22 - to kind of learn it.
06:23 - How, again, I got really
good at computer programming
06:27 - in such a short amount of time
06:28 - was I was learning it on
my own from online courses
06:31 - before my college even
started teaching me it.
06:35 - And that's how, you know,
I kind of got good at it.
06:38 - I would just do it, and
I would have fun with it.
06:40 - And how I was able to spend so much time,
06:43 - like up to 15 to 20 hours a day at times,
06:45 - was because I never thought
of it like work or homework
06:48 - or assignments or a project
I had to do to be graded on.
06:51 - I was using it to solve my own problems.
06:54 - I was like, "Hmm, I wanna
create a link-sharing app
06:56 - "because I like to share lots
of content with my friends,
06:59 - "but I want to do it
in an intellectual way.
07:02 - "I wanna have it so it
has its own categories.
07:04 - "I wanna have it so when
I share this content,
07:06 - "one of my friends get notified.
07:08 - "I wanna have it so that my friend,
07:10 - "when he sees this comment,
07:11 - "sees my post that I made on this website,
07:15 - "it notifies me.
07:16 - "And then when he writes something,
07:17 - "we're notifying each other."
07:19 - And I wanted to create this
really epic link-sharing app,
07:23 - and I did it and it was
awesome for my friend
07:26 - and it was awesome for me.
07:27 - And the day that I was
actually getting paid
07:31 - to work with a client and work on code,
07:33 - I was like, are you freaking serious?
07:35 - I'm getting paid for something so amazing?
07:37 - Creating things from scratch
and building my ideas
07:41 - and turning them into digitized things?
07:44 - Like, I'm learning and I'm getting paid?
07:47 - This is ridiculous!
07:48 - So that's the power of making it play.
07:53 - You'll be so limited if you
just do it for a job change.
07:57 - So many people's like, "I just
wanna do it for a job change.
07:59 - "I just wanna do it because
I heard computer programming,
08:01 - "there's a lot more money in this field."
08:04 - Yes, there is.
08:05 - I totally agree with you,
08:06 - and that's what actually
brought me into it.
08:09 - But you have to make it fun for you.
08:12 - You have to do it in a way
where you're not being...
08:16 - The information's not being
forced down your throat.
08:19 - You're learning it on your own time,
08:22 - at your own pace, and you're enjoying it.
08:25 - I want you to be sitting there like,
08:27 - wake up in the morning,
having a cup of coffee,
08:29 - talking with some of your friends,
08:31 - and then being like, "You know what?
08:33 - "It's time for me to code now."
08:34 - "I'm gonna do this.
08:36 - "I'm gonna build some fun project today."
08:38 - "That's what I'm gonna work on."
08:39 - Or, "I'm gonna solve
some really cool problem
08:41 - "just for my brain, my mental stimulation,
08:44 - "just to kind of get ahead."
08:47 - And when you can do that,
08:49 - you will excel beyond everybody.
08:51 - And I know I'm emphasizing this a lot.
08:53 - I'm gonna get some people,
08:54 - "You're talking way too
much about one thing."
08:57 - Look, then this video's
not for you, to be honest.
08:59 - Okay?
09:00 - The reason why I'm stressing this so much
09:03 - is because this is the number one
09:05 - most important thing to excel at,
09:06 - in really anything that you do.
09:09 - Then around having fun,
09:11 - you can create systems of productivity
09:13 - that make you accountable
09:14 - and hold you to it and the standard.
09:16 - But unless you're having fun,
09:18 - you're gonna quit and you're
gonna do the least amount
09:21 - and you're not gonna really understand
09:22 - what's going on at the
most fundamental levels,
09:24 - which is gonna stop you and handicap you
09:26 - from growing exponentially.
09:29 - So, this was the third tip
09:31 - and quite possibly the most important one.
09:35 - Alright, moving onto tip number four.
09:42 - I want you to learn how to ask for help.
09:47 - A lot of people ask me,
09:51 - "Please, please help, please code.
09:52 - "Please, my code is broken, please."
09:55 - Like, they spent more time saying please
09:57 - and showing their desperation
than anything else.
10:00 - Those are the people I
filter out like this.
10:02 - I will not help you if you're desperate.
10:05 - And it's not just about coding,
it's about anything in life.
10:10 - If you wanna actually
succeed and get good,
10:13 - why are you panicking?
10:15 - You should be having fun, right?
10:17 - This should be like,
10:19 - a problem-solving kind of thing for you.
10:21 - Whenever I was stuck in a problem
10:23 - and really it was hurting my brain...
10:27 - I mean, that's kind of amazing.
10:29 - And I would sit there and be like,
10:31 - "Okay, how can I try to solve it?"
10:33 - And look, I understand.
10:34 - There are times where you'll get stuck
10:36 - and can't get out of it.
10:37 - But being desperate is not gonna help you.
10:40 - Think about it and write analytically.
10:44 - Like, "Okay, so I wrote
down three functions
10:48 - "and here's an if and
then statement that works,
10:52 - "and I know it's doing it correctly
10:54 - "because of reasons A, B, C.
10:59 - "I've tested it and I
know that this works.
11:01 - "But then this other if
statement that I wrote
11:03 - "or this other function that I wrote
11:05 - "doesn't work, and here's why.
11:08 - "Reasons A, B, and C."
11:12 - So you've done two things.
11:14 - First of all, proven to
me that you're not lazy
11:16 - and you're just making me work for you.
11:19 - Also, you have taken the time
11:21 - to really analyze your problem.
11:23 - 99% of the times, if you
go so deeply analytical
11:27 - into solving your problem,
11:28 - you'll realize that you...
11:31 - Actually solved it.
11:33 - If you go deep down into actually being
11:35 - really specific with your questions,
11:37 - you'll end up solving your own problem.
11:39 - And I know this because I
posted on Stack Overflow
11:42 - and all these forums so
many times in my life,
11:44 - asking for help, and that's
one way I ended up solving it
11:47 - most of the times.
11:48 - Don't be desperate.
11:49 - Relax.
11:50 - Coding is fun, it's awesome.
11:52 - You're building your own ideas,
11:54 - you're digitizing things.
11:56 - A lot of the panic comes from,
11:58 - "I have my assignment due tomorrow.
11:59 - "I don't know what to do."
12:00 - You should've started a while ago,
12:02 - and you should've starred doing
things that were fun for you
12:04 - so when you get to the assignment,
it's like play for you.
12:07 - Play time, baby.
12:08 - Don't be that person who waits
12:11 - until it's the last day
before the assignment is due.
12:14 - Then you're not gonna develop
a passions or love for it,
12:17 - you're gonna associate
computer programming and coding
12:21 - with this feeling of work and stress.
12:25 - Just like, for example,
12:26 - living in the city of Chicago is awesome,
12:28 - but I always say I would
hate to live in there
12:31 - and I wanna live in the suburbs.
12:32 - Do you know why?
12:33 - I'm not an introverted person.
12:35 - I like to go out, have fun,
hang out with my friends.
12:38 - So what could be the reason
why I don't wanna live there?
12:42 - Because every time I commute,
there's crazy traffic.
12:46 - Every time I have to do something
12:49 - like go to the court or
deal with legal stuff,
12:52 - I have to go to the city of Chicago.
12:55 - And because of that, I end up associating
12:58 - the city of Chicago with these bad things,
13:01 - and that makes me not
wanna live in the city.
13:04 - Do you understand what I'm saying?
13:06 - If you relate that back
to the world of code
13:09 - and how you learn,
13:10 - you're not gonna enjoy it
13:11 - if you just associate it with work,
13:13 - meeting deadlines, only a job career.
13:18 - You're not gonna get very far.
13:21 - Computer programming,
look, is not hard to learn.
13:23 - You don't need to be a
certain age to learn it.
13:26 - Somebody who's 58 years old
just asked me a question,
13:29 - saying, "Hey, is this for me?
13:31 - "Can I still do it?"
13:32 - Yes, you can.
13:33 - You literally need like,
less than half a year
13:36 - and you can actually land freelancing gigs
13:39 - that'll pay you good money.
13:41 - Like, a while ago I
landed a gig, personally,
13:44 - that paid me $100 an hour.
13:46 - And they gave me full-time work, okay?
13:50 - And that was years ago.
13:51 - And that was with me having like...
13:54 - I don't know, half a year or a
year of experience in coding.
13:57 - So money will come.
14:00 - There's money in this field.
14:02 - But don't just be attracted to the money.
14:06 - You're not gonna get
good, but most importantly
14:08 - you're not gonna have fun.
14:11 - I don't want you to be
thinking of it like,
14:14 - "Oh, nine to five I'm gonna work,
14:16 - "and then I get to come home
and then I get to have fun."
14:18 - No, that nine to five
should be fun for you.
14:21 - Because then when you come home,
14:23 - you're not mentally drained.
14:25 - You have energy and passion
to spend with your loved ones.
14:30 - If you come drained from
work like everybody else,
14:33 - you're gonna be grumpy at home,
14:35 - not give quality time
to your family, right?
14:39 - Look, you're not tired, you're uninspired.
14:44 - If you thought that was powerful,
14:47 - tweet it @CleverQazi.
14:50 - People working a lot who
say they're burned out,
14:55 - they're not tired, they're uninspired.
14:58 - There's no such thing as burnout.
15:03 - I may be rambling on at this point,
15:05 - but again, there's no
such thing as burnout.
15:08 - It's only when you do things
that don't fill your purpose
15:12 - and your goals and your motivation,
15:14 - that's what makes you feel
you're burned out, okay?
15:17 - So I'm gonna kind of end it
15:19 - with the four tips that I gave you, okay?
15:21 - Syntax.
15:22 - Follow the syntax.
15:25 - Pay attention to small details.
15:28 - Or I'll be using two equal
signs for a quality operator
15:31 - or one equal sign for
an assigment operator.
15:33 - If it's a function,
15:35 - does it have open-close
parentheses after it?
15:37 - Am I missing a colon?
15:38 - Simple things.
15:39 - Am I misspelling the word?
15:41 - Don't think you're above that.
15:42 - I'm not above that, and
nobody else is, either.
15:45 - You will make spelling
simple, stupid mistakes,
15:47 - and it's okay.
15:48 - Two, keep it simple.
15:52 - Don't overcomplicate things.
15:53 - Don't jump into learning about AI
15:55 - just because you spent one hour
15:58 - learning about if-then
statements and functions, okay?
16:01 - Please learn the basics.
16:03 - So many people jump into
learning about advanced concepts
16:07 - and it destroys their
learning in the future.
16:12 - So keep it simple.
16:16 - Three, make it play.
16:18 - Have fun, make it play,
enjoy what you're doing.
16:21 - This is what I just
talked about for so long.
16:24 - Four, how to ask for help.
16:26 - Don't be desperate, be
specific when you ask for help.
16:29 - Most of the times, it'll
solve your problem.
16:31 - And if it doesn't solve your problem,
16:33 - it'll make me want to help you.
16:35 - Otherwise, you just seem lazy.
16:37 - It seems like you're desperate.
16:39 - It seems like your
assignment is due tomorrow,
16:42 - you want me to do the homework for you.
16:44 - Right?
16:45 - Those are all the things
that people think about
16:47 - when you ask them for help.
16:49 - Make sure you do your homework
before you ask for help.
16:52 - It'll solve your problems, save you time,
16:55 - but most importantly help you learn.
16:58 - Because you need to make your own mistakes
17:00 - and struggle with them before
you can truly learn, okay?
17:04 - If all the answers and
solutions are fed to you,
17:06 - you're not gonna learn.
17:07 - You're just watching Netflix.
17:09 - You're not actually following a course.
17:11 - Okay?
17:16 - So that's it for this video.
17:18 - I love your faces off.
