00:00 - - How much do you guys
think a programmer makes?
00:04 - - One million dollars?
00:19 - - Hey guys, what is up, this is Qazi
00:22 - from cleverprogrammer.com
and you are watching
00:25 - Interview Questions.
00:26 - So today we decided to go
down to a mall and ask a bunch
00:30 - of people what they think
computer programming is
00:33 - and first, I want you to take
a look at their responses
00:36 - and afterwards, we're
gonna go on to actually
00:38 - answer and address most
of these questions,
00:41 - starting with the most important question,
00:44 - what is computer programming?
00:46 - We are here at Woodfield Mall.
00:50 - And we're gonna take
you on the ride with us
00:52 - so let's get going, alright?
00:57 - (gentle upbeat music)
01:01 - - Hey everyone, my name is
Tenzin from developertenzin.com.
01:04 - - Do you guys know what
computer programming is?
01:07 - - It's where you put all
the brains inside the box.
01:10 - - I mean, I don't exactly,
but the whole software
01:13 - and stuff is done by coding,
so, numbers and letters.
01:19 - - The engineer.
01:21 - - Computer programmer
makes codes for different
01:24 - computer programs to operate
systems on a computer.
01:31 - - How things work, like
making something work,
01:34 - function correctly?
01:39 - - Essentially, at its
very core, it's simply
01:42 - a way to digitize your ideas.
01:45 - This idea can be related
to a field in biology
01:48 - related to a medical field.
01:50 - - I wanna go into the medical field.
01:52 - - Even in a lot of biology research,
01:54 - they can sometimes use
computer programming.
01:55 - - Yeah, they do.
01:56 - - To an engineering field,
or it could be related
01:58 - to whatever the heck you
want it to be related to.
02:01 - - I wanna teach digital
media, so there's probably
02:04 - some coding involved in that.
02:06 - - Probably video game design.
02:07 - - Sounds like a lot of
coding there, or no?
02:09 - - A lot, yeah, definitely a lot.
02:13 - - Now let's talk about why
it might be useful to you.
02:17 - Imagine you were trying
to build a video game
02:20 - and you wanted to put it
on an interactive website.
02:23 - Using programming, you could
build your very own game
02:27 - that nobody has built
in the very specific way
02:29 - that you want it built,
and you could put it
02:32 - on your very own interactive, fun website.
02:35 - Now let's talk about
maybe more practical ways
02:37 - for some of you people who are like,
02:39 - "I wanna make that money," right?
02:42 - Business intelligence, it
helps you make better and more
02:46 - informed decisions not just
based on your intuition,
02:49 - sometimes intuitions are
good, but you need it
02:52 - backed up by evidence and
data, which programming
02:55 - will allow you to do, and
the field of data science
02:57 - and data analytics is all
based on computer programming.
03:01 - It helps you take a lot of these features
03:04 - that you can't process all at once
03:06 - and let's the computer decide for you
03:08 - what decisions to make,
how powerful is that?
03:11 - And you can generate
more leads and more money
03:13 - for your business.
03:14 - But Qazi, why do I need to have
myself learn how to program,
03:18 - why can't I just have anybody
else digitize my idea for me?
03:22 - Imagine Mark Zuckerberg.
03:23 - The idea, the specific idea
that Mark Zuckerberg had,
03:27 - a lot of other people had similar ideas
03:29 - how to create social media,
but his idea was the key,
03:34 - so a lot of you folks, who
have these brilliant ideas,
03:38 - you wanna be able to execute them.
03:40 - So yes, you can hire
somebody to do it for you,
03:43 - but I promise you it's
not gonna be as good
03:45 - as if you did it yourself.
03:48 - If those weren't reasons enough for you,
03:50 - let's talk about instant scalability.
03:53 - Any idea that you digitize and
that you create on your own,
03:56 - you can scale it infinitely.
03:59 - Imagine you create an app that
solves some kind of problem.
04:03 - Maybe it's a fitness-related issue
04:04 - or a finance-related
issue like a budgeting app
04:07 - or like a working out app, all of a sudden
04:10 - with the click of a button,
thousands and millions
04:13 - of people are having that problem solved
04:15 - 'cause they're able to download your app
04:17 - or go on your website and
use what you've created.
04:21 - What other medium allows you to scale
04:24 - at that level and so fast?
04:26 - There are not many that I can think of.
04:27 - Like, when you think of
a computer programmer,
04:30 - what do they look like to you
04:31 - and what do you imagine in your mind?
04:34 - - An overly-smart person
dressed in skinny jeans
04:40 - and a tight button-up shirt.
04:42 - - Okay.
04:43 - - Probably just an average
guy, probably wears glasses.
04:47 - - Like this guy.
- Like that guy, okay?
04:50 - - Yeah, yeah.
04:51 - - Okay, pretty shirt,
well-dressed, skinny pants
04:55 - and with some dress shoes
on, brown dress shoes.
04:58 - - You have to look nice, yeah.
- Right, right, right.
05:01 - - I just imagine a nerdy guy
at a computer just typing,
05:05 - I don't know.
05:06 - - That's funny, my husband
owns his own computer business
05:08 - but he just wears like a polo shirt
05:11 - and nice shorts or pants.
05:14 - - I met a lot of computer programmers,
05:16 - so they're actually not close
to the stereotypes at all,
05:20 - like they were nice suits
and stuff, well-off men.
05:23 - - Alright, now let's talk
about the job market.
05:27 - Okay so, so far you've
been following me along,
05:29 - you're like, "This is great,
Qazi, I wanna do this!"
05:31 - Whatever this very thing
is, so let me give you
05:34 - a little bit about what
kind of jobs you can get.
05:38 - The job market for a computer programmer
05:40 - looks pretty fantastic.
05:43 - Now, don't get me confused by
thinking that it's instantly
05:48 - easy to become a programmer,
it's not, I personally, myself,
05:52 - have failed a tremendous
amount of times, you guys,
05:56 - while I was trying to become
a computer programmer,
05:58 - and even to this day, I
fail over and over again.
06:01 - Anything that has a true value,
06:03 - you know from personal
experience that it's hard.
06:06 - There are 1.4 million job
openings for computer programming
06:09 - every single year, however,
the number of college
06:13 - computer science
graduates is only 400,000,
06:17 - which means money money for you.
06:20 - How does it translate to that?
06:22 - There's a one million
people per year window
06:25 - open just for you.
06:27 - Compared to all other
jobs or most other jobs,
06:30 - the job of software technology is growing
06:33 - at a 17% rate every single year.
06:36 - So the growth, the projected outlook,
06:40 - all the way up to 2024 is only growing.
06:44 - Now let's talk about
the money you can make
06:47 - from computer programming.
06:51 - - What do you think computer
programmers make annually?
06:55 - - Okay I know that women make
a lot more money in the field
06:57 - because they don't have a
lot of women in the field
07:01 - right now, so I'd say maybe like 70,
07:05 - starting maybe 60, I don't know.
07:08 - - So if you're a girl,
07:10 - you know what you need to start doing.
07:13 - - 80,000.
07:14 - - Probably like 70 to 90,000.
07:18 - - Well a lot, it's a
really good skill to have.
07:21 - I'm guessing around 50,000, maybe more.
07:25 - - $50,000.
- 92.
07:28 - - 92, very specific.
07:29 - - So at this point, you're
like, "Oh yeah, I'm excited."
07:33 - So let's talk about it.
07:35 - 2015 statistics show that the average
07:39 - median salary is $100,490.
07:46 - That is a pretty good
median salary, right?
07:49 - Not many jobs might start off with that.
07:52 - Glassdoor.com that say if
you look at a specific area
07:55 - like Chicago, the median salary
07:57 - might be $85,000, give or take.
08:00 - Now why is the range so different,
08:03 - it depends on where you live.
08:04 - If you live in the Silicon
Valley, the heart of technology,
08:08 - you are going to be getting paid more
08:10 - for the jobs, most of the times.
08:12 - If you're living in other
places, like Chicago,
08:15 - it might be a little bit less
than the top, the $100,000
08:18 - that you could potentially be making.
08:20 - Why you might actually really
enjoy your job more than just
08:22 - the money is the amount of
impact that you're making.
08:25 - Most of the programmers are able to work
08:27 - either from their office or remotely.
08:29 - This means you get to spend
more time with your family,
08:33 - you get to spend more
time with your friends.
08:35 - So if you're working with, let's say,
08:38 - a company like Microsoft,
you're effecting and influencing
08:40 - the lives of millions of people.
08:42 - So your role in the
society is very important
08:45 - and as one of my really
smart friends once said,
08:49 - "Your rewards in life
are exactly proportional,
08:53 - "no less and no more,
than the contribution
08:55 - "you make in your society."
08:58 - Did you let that sink in?
08:59 - Good.
09:00 - Because programming allows you
to make a tremendous amount
09:04 - of contribution to the society,
simply 'cause it lets you
09:07 - scale instantly, so that great
amazing idea that you had,
09:11 - yeah, now everybody is using it
09:14 - and it's changing their lives.
09:15 - Okay guys, so at this point,
I think that hopefully
09:18 - this video has blown your brains to bits
09:21 - and you're like, "This is fantastic,
09:23 - "What can I do to get started?"
09:25 - You're looking for that
sign-up button for success.
09:29 - Unfortunately, I don't have
a sign-up button for success
09:32 - but I do have a button to
subscribe, so click that,
09:36 - stay tuned for my videos
because not only will I make
09:39 - videos based on entertainment
and how fun programming is,
09:42 - but a lot of them are based on tutorials
09:44 - so watching these tutorials,
you yourself can learn
09:48 - how to program and how
to get started in it
09:51 - and if you're worried and you're not ready
09:53 - to make that dip into
majoring in computer science
09:56 - and paying a heck of a lot of money
09:58 - for something that you can
maybe learn on your own
10:01 - or at least get your feet
wet and see what it's about,
10:04 - check out my tutorials,
if you don't like it,
10:07 - well just stop watching the
video and leave the channel,
10:10 - it's as simple as that, right?
10:12 - But if you do like it,
stay by, watch more videos,
10:14 - you're welcome to be here,
it's mi casa, su casa, right?
10:18 - My house is your house,
as they say in Spanish.
10:22 - Anyways, it's been really exciting, guys,
10:25 - thank you so much for watching this video,
10:27 - please like it if you liked it,
10:29 - other than that, I love
every one of you guys,
10:31 - I will see you in the next video.
10:35 - Boom!
10:37 - Do you enjoy it or is it something
10:39 - that you're just like, "Meh, it's okay."
10:44 - - No enjoying it.
10:46 - - You don't enjoy it?
10:47 - - Yes, no.
10:50 - - Are you okay with this being on YouTube?
10:51 - - Yeah yeah, that's fine.
10:53 - - Yeah definitely.
10:53 - - Can I put this on YouTube?
10:57 - - Okay, yes.
10:57 - - Last question, very important,
10:59 - can we put this on YouTube?
11:01 - - Most certainly.
- Yes.
11:03 - - And this last thing, is this okay
11:04 - if we choose to put it on YouTube?
11:07 - - Go for it.
11:08 - - Is this okay if we put this on YouTube?
11:11 - - Yes, I am fine.
11:12 - - Can we put that on YouTube?
11:13 - - Yeah, yes.
11:15 - - Amazing, Ruby, nice to meet you.
11:17 - - Where do I find you guys?
11:20 - - The channel name is
called cleverprogrammer.com.
