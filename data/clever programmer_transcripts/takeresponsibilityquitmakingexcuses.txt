00:01 - Hi how are you doing
00:03 - I want to talk about responsibility
00:07 - and if we break this word down right
00:10 - it's essentially response
00:14 - ability so what does that mean well it
00:18 - means your ability to respond to a
00:21 - situation
00:23 - it means
00:25 - to transcend circumstance or the things
00:30 - that are happening to you that you think
00:32 - are making you act a certain way the
00:35 - things that are making you dependent on
00:39 - your actions
00:41 - or rather your reactions
00:45 - all right so with responsibility
00:49 - you have to take things in your control
00:54 - it essentially gives you a way to
00:56 - respond to your situation rather than
00:59 - being a byproduct of your situation
01:04 - now these things are very important I
01:07 - don't care if it has to do with computer
01:08 - programming or you're trying to learn
01:11 - about finances you're trying to become a
01:14 - business consultant
01:16 - whatever it is
01:18 - this is something that's very important
01:20 - for you to understand
01:23 - there's so many people that try not to
01:25 - take responsibility for their actions
01:28 - they blame others
01:31 - and they react to everything if the
01:33 - weather is bad well they're gonna not go
01:36 - to the gym or they're not going to be
01:39 - productive they're going to let
01:41 - the weather decide their mood their
01:45 - levels of productivity their levels of
01:48 - work
01:52 - and if you think about companies that
01:54 - are trying to hire you they're looking
01:56 - for problem solvers they're looking for
01:59 - people who can come up with solutions to
02:01 - solve things they're not looking for
02:03 - problems
02:06 - and by reacting to things and by not
02:09 - being responsible
02:14 - you're not going to be able to provide
02:16 - Solutions you're not going to be
02:18 - autonomous you're not going to be
02:19 - self-functioning and nobody wants to
02:22 - work with people who can't function on
02:24 - their own you know the people who always
02:26 - have a question about everything
02:30 - and won't go out of their way to
02:33 - research it even if they knew how to
02:36 - because well it's simpler to just ask
02:38 - rather than to actually conduct their
02:41 - own thorough research before asking a
02:45 - question
02:48 - right
02:49 - So within your lives if there's one
02:53 - thing you can focus on right now to
02:55 - improve
02:57 - this is probably the most powerful thing
03:00 - you can improve in your life
03:02 - start taking responsibility for things
03:04 - even for things that potentially
03:08 - are not your fault
03:11 - especially if you're working on a team
03:13 - if one person makes a mistake
03:18 - the love to say it wasn't them
03:21 - if somebody makes a mistake they go well
03:23 - yeah that guy made a mistake right that
03:25 - guy made a mistake they won't take it as
03:27 - we made a mistake
03:29 - or if they do something good they'll be
03:32 - like oh yeah you know we did this but
03:34 - that was my idea instead of that was our
03:37 - idea and we did it
03:41 - so learn to take responsibility
03:45 - learn to stand up for either people
03:48 - you're with
03:51 - and practice those things
03:55 - it's going to be very valuable
03:57 - and if you won't see the power of it now
04:00 - in your life maybe if it's helping you
04:02 - with your relationships or if it's
04:04 - helping you with how you are with your
04:07 - friends or your levels of popularity or
04:11 - whatever if it's not helping you with
04:12 - those or you don't care about those
04:14 - you will see that disability
04:18 - will definitely transmute itself into
04:20 - its monetary equivalence
04:23 - what do I mean by that well what I mean
04:25 - by that is money
04:27 - so if the other things aren't that
04:29 - important to you
04:30 - then remember that this high levels of
04:34 - responsibility will make you more
04:36 - employable more attractive for job
04:38 - opportunities and more attractive for
04:41 - promotions
04:43 - as well okay
04:46 - that's my message for today take
04:48 - responsibility
