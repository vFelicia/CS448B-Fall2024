00:00 - what is up everybody
00:04 - this is nas and i am here with my friend
00:07 - [Music]
00:09 - wait this way jacob and jacob who's
00:12 - jacob who are you jacob
00:15 - hey guys jacob here um i'm running my
00:18 - own
00:18 - um software agency together with two
00:21 - other founders
00:22 - it's been crazy last eight almost nine
00:26 - months and
00:26 - i'm not gonna lie i have a lot to share
00:28 - with you i've been also working with nas
00:30 - before in a clever programmer team this
00:32 - is how we know each other
00:33 - i've been a coach uh teaching python
00:36 - also i've been
00:36 - working uh three different companies
00:38 - before so yeah
00:40 - yeah it's been quite experience
00:43 - so he is a very experienced guy so jacob
00:46 - guy just so you know okay okay
00:47 - he's kind of chased himself but jacob
00:49 - right he is currently 22 years old he
00:51 - started coding when did you start coding
00:52 - jacob
00:54 - like four or five years old uh like the
00:56 - first line of code i was yeah so yeah
01:00 - really no no no five years old
01:04 - in high school it was like five years
01:07 - yeah yeah
01:07 - five years ago started coding basically
01:09 - you did not you did you go to college or
01:11 - no
01:13 - yeah yeah yeah i've been first going to
01:14 - college in poland and i dropped out and
01:16 - i was working
01:17 - full-time uh job as a programmer and now
01:20 - currently i'm also student however i'm
01:22 - focusing most
01:23 - on my company so it's just
01:26 - yeah so so he guys he started off kind
01:30 - of basically like i said he did go to
01:31 - college
01:32 - he then he got us a job at a startup
01:34 - company right
01:35 - after that he actually worked with us as
01:37 - well over here with cleverprogrammer
01:39 - he was part of a lot of you know he was
01:41 - teaching students he was a
01:42 - big part of profit with python right
01:45 - after that he decided to kind of start
01:47 - out his own
01:47 - agency at the age of 22 right and he's
01:51 - been killing it kind of since then
01:52 - right he is of course it has not been
01:54 - easy for him
01:56 - at all we all know that right he's like
01:58 - holy it's hard
02:00 - right we'll talk about kind of his
02:01 - struggles today what got him into it
02:04 - and what made him now is six figure
02:06 - software agency owner right
02:08 - he has his own statistic but the name of
02:11 - self
02:12 - made which i think is really cool and
02:14 - now he just kind of
02:15 - he has a few people that work with him
02:17 - he has well you have three
02:18 - you have two other co-founders correct
02:20 - with you at this point exactly
02:23 - exactly then we have a designer and two
02:25 - programmers
02:27 - but me and my other co-founder we also
02:29 - like both full-time coders i would say
02:30 - even more than full-time
02:32 - uh this is how it is when you start your
02:33 - own agency it's not really
02:36 - you quit nine to five to do nine to nine
02:38 - or even more
02:39 - from 99 to nine to ten somebody's like
02:42 - hey have you ever dealt with failure oh
02:44 - i'm sure he's dealt with failure
02:46 - especially as he's going to something
02:48 - like this so guys but biscuit today
02:50 - we'll talk about his
02:51 - his you know his process what got him
02:54 - into it right
02:55 - and how he just kind of became the
02:57 - developer that he is today
02:58 - and of course if you have any questions
03:01 - whatsoever
03:02 - let me know of course let us know in the
03:04 - comments and we'll make sure to
03:06 - ask jacob here with those questions okay
03:09 - so if you have anything that's
03:10 - interesting just for go ahead
03:13 - and you know answer that awesome guys so
03:15 - that's pretty much it so
03:16 - jacob now tell me a little about this
03:17 - okay tell me kind of
03:19 - one is what got you into coding how you
03:21 - got started into coding and so forth
03:23 - okay
03:24 - all right yeah so it's early beginnings
03:26 - right i mean my whole life i've been
03:28 - into
03:28 - computers uh right and i started as a
03:31 - really professional gamer at some point
03:32 - i was
03:33 - considering a career as a gamer in the
03:35 - league of legends then contest strike
03:37 - but at some point it got me thinking
03:39 - that it may not be this thing right you
03:41 - were a gamer as well
03:43 - yeah i was like man i've been grinding
03:45 - games like
03:46 - when there was first season second
03:48 - season in league of legends i've been
03:49 - diamond and the diamond was the highest
03:51 - division so i've been killing it back in
03:53 - the days
03:54 - uh every day like 10 hours so on yeah
03:56 - that was like how i started
03:58 - then at some point i wanted to start to
04:00 - build my own games and man it's been so
04:02 - funny because then i went to a shop
04:04 - and i don't know it was a time when
04:07 - there was like a lot of those
04:08 - nice books and stuff like this uh those
04:10 - small shops
04:11 - so i got my hand on the first book and
04:13 - it was about building games
04:15 - and then i was like wow it's about
04:17 - building games using what
04:18 - uh it is i mean they introduced to some
04:21 - kind of a game builder so it was
04:23 - a lot of like blocks to put in so
04:26 - this is how i started building the it's
04:28 - it was i think rpg maker
04:30 - so you could literally build like a tbr
04:32 - game it's like a
04:33 - very old game um and yeah and then
04:36 - at some point there was like some kind
04:38 - of custom logic and it was
04:40 - all code and i was like wow what is it
04:43 - so you have to code stuff
04:44 - sort of like my first approach why did i
04:47 - have to learn
04:48 - here yeah exactly then that was like my
04:51 - first uh let's say touch and coding then
04:53 - and when i was
04:54 - around 11 or 12 i get myself into
04:58 - html a little bit and php but it was
05:00 - like literally nothing
05:02 - like a little bit of css so i started to
05:05 - know what
05:06 - it takes to build a website right but
05:09 - like
05:10 - to be honest the first time i really
05:12 - started to code like was in my last
05:14 - uh last year in high school
05:17 - because then i had we had a final test
05:19 - to get to university
05:21 - and uh we could choose between math
05:23 - physics uh
05:24 - also i t so i selected math and i t
05:27 - and this is how i started coding because
05:29 - i had to learn that and it's been it's
05:31 - been very fun but it was all just c
05:33 - and c plus plus so i was kind of also
05:35 - scared it wasn't i wasn't really
05:36 - motivated because
05:37 - it was just about pointers and
05:39 - allocating memory and man it
05:41 - it's been tough that is not fun at all
05:45 - not at all so then we went to like i
05:49 - went to
05:49 - uh college first year and we had this uh
05:53 - subject called python
05:54 - and not a lot of people were uh really
05:57 - into that but
05:58 - men jumping from a c to python when so
06:00 - many figures
06:01 - really nicely and nicely obstructed that
06:04 - you don't have to deal with allocating
06:05 - memory
06:06 - and pointers error i mean not really
06:08 - like there are also pointers in python
06:09 - but it's another story
06:11 - man it's been such a nice uh game
06:13 - changer for me
06:14 - because then i just i started to doing
06:16 - uh a lot about python just by myself
06:19 - right so i
06:20 - i checked like udemy courses and so on
06:22 - so and i was building my first software
06:23 - just
06:24 - for myself so i know other people were
06:27 - partying were
06:28 - doing some other stuff and i was just
06:29 - sitting in my room working and just
06:31 - coding
06:32 - i mean i was also a party guy of course
06:34 - oh this guy's
06:35 - a party guy too i know that are you
06:37 - kidding me
06:39 - but of course i mean in life you need
06:41 - need to have balance right like that's
06:43 - what i
06:44 - preach so of course when i go party i go
06:47 - party hard but
06:48 - it's usually after i do a really good
06:50 - accomplishment in my work so
06:52 - right just keeping the balance is very
06:54 - important but this is how i got into
06:55 - coding yeah
06:56 - so jacob so basically again so you went
06:59 - from c
06:59 - plus plus or from c up uh is that
07:01 - correct and
07:02 - your goal was that you kind of got into
07:04 - it because you know
07:06 - you were introduced to it through gaming
07:08 - right so you wanted to put the game
07:10 - and you started to you bought a book
07:12 - right and so forth and
07:14 - there was a lot of coding like holy
07:16 - what is this right at which point did
07:18 - you realize that okay this is
07:19 - interesting like this is something that
07:20 - i might want to do
07:23 - i mean to be honest uh like when i first
07:26 - touched those books with coding games
07:27 - uh i wasn't really interested then
07:29 - because i didn't understand really
07:31 - english and anything
07:32 - so it was very tough for me uh then then
07:35 - the same with html i didn't really know
07:37 - what i can do with it so i kind of
07:39 - put it away for a couple of years and
07:41 - then at high school
07:42 - when the whole coding fig got to me
07:45 - again then like also talking about i.t
07:47 - was very hot topic so i just got into it
07:50 - because
07:50 - at the end of the day i had to decide
07:52 - what will be my career path so at some
07:54 - point i wanted to be a doctor because i
07:56 - got really
07:57 - excited about biology but on the other
08:00 - hand i was always scared of blood so i
08:02 - was like no way i won't deal with that
08:04 - right but also i loved math and i think
08:07 - that
08:08 - i mean definitely c plus plus was always
08:10 - um like
08:12 - when i thought about c plus plus and
08:13 - there's case like and the
08:15 - algorithms which i learned and also like
08:17 - the tasks i
08:18 - solved they were really mathematical and
08:20 - especially in the beginning so this is
08:22 - how i got interested into that i was
08:23 - like okay let's
08:24 - try this more let's see what you can do
08:28 - and you can build with that and yeah
08:29 - again like the first university
08:32 - not really university itself but just
08:33 - the fact that i went to
08:35 - through a different like
08:39 - online courses this gave me actually a
08:41 - whole uh
08:42 - motivation to learn it really that's
08:45 - interesting wait
08:46 - so the online so the online courses
08:48 - which give you the motivation to
08:50 - to go for for what what line course did
08:52 - you take i'm curious
08:54 - was literally like some udemy free
08:57 - courses or some random youtube ones from
08:59 - python also like at some point i built a
09:02 - game in c
09:02 - plus plus uh that was a funny to go back
09:05 - into that
09:06 - because it was like university pro
09:07 - project and
09:09 - that was all about that right but the
09:10 - thing is that
09:12 - they didn't really teach this python
09:13 - university it was like literally
09:15 - like just trying it right
09:18 - but i was really at some like after my
09:20 - first year in
09:22 - university i was really motivated to
09:23 - actually get into the
09:25 - more and get my first job so man
09:28 - like usually no one gets internship
09:30 - after the first year
09:32 - of university but in my case i just i
09:35 - just wanted
09:36 - i just wanted it i i literally wanted it
09:39 - tell me why why did you want to
09:40 - because the thing is a lot of a lot of
09:42 - you know a lot of people what they might
09:43 - want to do is when they start out right
09:45 - they're like okay well i want to go to
09:46 - college i'm going to have some fun right
09:48 - i'm going gonna party it up you know
09:49 - maybe i'll learn a few things and so
09:51 - forth
09:51 - what kind of pushed you to know what to
09:53 - be like well you know what i kind of
09:55 - want to
09:56 - learn something i actually want to get a
09:58 - job in a way what was pushing to get a
10:00 - job were your parents pushing to get a
10:02 - job what was it
10:03 - not at all not my parents it's it's been
10:05 - more most
10:06 - also from my like kind of a goal in the
10:09 - life which was like
10:10 - okay so i'm from like i was born in
10:12 - germany but only i was born there and
10:14 - then i lived my whole life in poland i
10:15 - don't even
10:16 - speak german uh but at some point i
10:18 - always german
10:20 - yeah i mean a little bit a little bit
10:21 - but like literally you live in germany
10:23 - but you don't speak german
10:25 - yeah that's that's actually funny that's
10:26 - another story you don't have to do
10:28 - especially in the
10:29 - in it you should not be allowed to be
10:32 - there
10:33 - yeah yeah i mean i i can i can order a
10:36 - good dinner in german so
10:38 - that's what i need needed for but no
10:41 - like
10:41 - to be honest like at some point uh
10:44 - like i lived my whole life in poland and
10:47 - i will i've been abroad couple of times
10:49 - and it was always very exciting for me
10:51 - how people from all around the world
10:53 - they meet and they just talk in english
10:55 - uh and talk about their uh countries and
10:58 - so on like i've been always hyped
11:00 - for that and the year before starting my
11:02 - university i went for kind of like a
11:04 - a one month uh i don't know how to sell
11:07 - like a summer camp
11:08 - um to learn german and english and man
11:10 - it's been the best time in my life like
11:12 - i'm not gonna swear and i was so
11:13 - motivated
11:14 - that i said to myself okay i need to get
11:16 - internship but
11:18 - it cannot be internship in poland i
11:20 - wanna go abroad
11:21 - so at this point i mean i i was talking
11:23 - english like i was speaking english but
11:25 - it was
11:25 - quite bad but i was so motivated to do
11:27 - it that i applied for like 50 different
11:30 - companies in the germany man
11:31 - i failed to all of them literally i went
11:34 - through interviews i couldn't
11:36 - answer any questions like because my
11:38 - knowledge you apply yeah so you apply
11:40 - to all these companies somebody's saying
11:42 - couldn't talk that's funny good
11:45 - in the comments it's hilarious so i
11:48 - actually use it sometimes i
11:49 - just say good and tag you know but
11:51 - anyway so um you apply to all these
11:53 - different companies right without having
11:55 - any well i mean you had a little bit of
11:56 - knowledge to code it but not much at all
11:59 - yeah yeah exactly and it doesn't it
12:01 - didn't really matter for me which kind
12:02 - of a language was there like man i
12:04 - literally
12:05 - applied for all of the internships and i
12:06 - lied in my cv because at this point i
12:08 - only knew python
12:10 - i had nothing to tell about in my cv my
12:12 - cv looked like like i'm not gonna
12:13 - lie it was like black
12:14 - and white with my picture and i said
12:17 - okay i know python
12:18 - and i went through different courses on
12:20 - udemy and i'm motivated to do everything
12:22 - man that was my cv
12:23 - right so we mentioned this so come with
12:25 - us
12:26 - tell me this okay what did you lie about
12:29 - on
12:29 - what did you lie about on the what's it
12:31 - called on uh on you
12:33 - on your resume so it wasn't really lying
12:36 - in the resume
12:37 - but it was like okay i know how to code
12:39 - in python c plus plus java and
12:41 - javascript right but to be honest i only
12:43 - knew
12:43 - a little bit about python like i mean
12:46 - the c which i learned in the high school
12:48 - right it was just for solving algorithms
12:50 - it wasn't to build any products so i
12:52 - hope that i will learn i'll push myself
12:54 - through
12:55 - through it because when i'm working on
12:56 - the pressure i work better
12:58 - so yeah when i was actually the case by
13:00 - the way just so you guys know
13:01 - yeah i need to work i need to work under
13:03 - pressure yeah under pressure when you
13:05 - work under pressure
13:06 - you know that's why all we always say
13:07 - you know what you know build the project
13:09 - and so and so forth right the projects
13:11 - and what you're doing in
13:12 - in school whatever i might be doing
13:14 - that's just kind of getting you ready
13:15 - for the real thing right
13:17 - that's kind of because the end goal is
13:19 - always going to be to get a job
13:21 - that actually puts under pressure
13:23 - because why when you're in that job
13:25 - that's when you actually learn the most
13:27 - right when you're around people right
13:30 - that's when you learn the most
13:31 - so actually that's that's kind of the
13:33 - best part about that right so
13:35 - um yeah it's something that i think is
13:38 - very important to say to
13:39 - to those to those who are listening
13:41 - because a lot of you guys are thinking
13:42 - well you know
13:43 - you know how do i go ahead and get that
13:45 - first job and so forth right
13:47 - and what's the most important thing
13:48 - where well you know the real most
13:50 - surprising experience
13:51 - is going to be at the job right but
13:55 - what jacob did here very interestingly
13:57 - is you know
13:58 - even though he didn't have much
13:59 - experience he's still right
14:03 - zero experience did you how much c plus
14:06 - parts did you know tell me
14:08 - man i mean literally like i went to
14:10 - pointers and maybe vectors and that was
14:12 - it like i just knew a little bit about
14:13 - algorithms so i couldn't really build
14:15 - any application with it like it was all
14:17 - command line tools right
14:19 - maximum that so that was it but anyway
14:22 - right i applied to all of those
14:23 - companies i failed all of them but still
14:25 - i was like okay
14:26 - i want to learn german and english and
14:29 - work abroad
14:31 - i have i want to have my internship so i
14:32 - was like okay when they also speak in
14:34 - german oh there's austria so i played to
14:37 - austria man
14:38 - also 50 companies yeah like i was like
14:41 - let's do it
14:42 - i failed i felt i failed and there's
14:43 - this one company they
14:45 - i went through interview process uh i i
14:48 - asked
14:49 - like i answered a couple of questions
14:51 - and then uh
14:52 - they said man like they called me after
14:54 - a few days that yeah you in i was like
14:56 - no but then and then i was like i
14:59 - was like super excited and then
15:01 - i asked what we will be doing there on
15:03 - during this internship man
15:05 - the lady was talking to me for like 20
15:08 - minutes and i couldn't understand
15:10 - anything out of it i was like yeah yeah
15:11 - okay sounds
15:12 - interesting yeah i totally know until
15:14 - again all this you just couldn't
15:15 - you know i totally know i got this i've
15:17 - done this before no problem so ever
15:19 - can you see for you guys in about one
15:21 - week okay no don't have to worry about
15:22 - this whatsoever right so
15:24 - that's funny at this point i was so
15:26 - excited that
15:28 - i was like yeah i'm going there so i
15:30 - went there uh alone actually like it was
15:32 - like
15:32 - 1 000 kilometers from my hometown i
15:34 - didn't know anyone also in this
15:36 - city i would actually it was in the
15:38 - salzburg it's very nice
15:40 - city in austria the company was named
15:42 - skidata
15:44 - actually they are really big in west
15:46 - europe
15:47 - and yeah the internship like the problem
15:50 - with the
15:50 - internship was that i was about to
15:53 - reboot and
15:54 - build extension to the app which was
15:56 - already there and the app was built
15:58 - in uh java and in the framework called
16:01 - spring
16:02 - man when i saw that when i saw it
16:05 - i was literally shooting my pants man i
16:07 - didn't know what to do like i
16:08 - literally i literally
16:13 - so why i i couldn't understand anything
16:16 - out of it
16:17 - again my english wasn't very good but i
16:20 - had my own boss right
16:21 - so literally for seven days i was
16:24 - researching everything about java
16:26 - about this framework and after work so i
16:29 - was doing there
16:30 - i was working there eight hours even
16:32 - more then i was going home i was
16:34 - doing research more and more because at
16:35 - some point i was like wow they would
16:36 - just kick me from the intern
16:38 - internship and after seven days uh i
16:41 - literally gave up and i said
16:42 - hey look um i think like that
16:46 - i won't be able to build that like this
16:49 - java framework spring is just it's too
16:52 - much for me and
16:53 - to be honest i have the most experience
16:55 - with python
16:56 - and i was very lucky because my my boss
16:59 - actually understood that
17:00 - and he said okay look jacob really uh
17:02 - yeah this is like a code base
17:04 - it doesn't have to be coded in this
17:06 - framework i understand that this might
17:08 - be tough especially that is your first
17:09 - job
17:10 - and we want you to bring you like give
17:12 - you as much experience
17:14 - and show you processes as we can so
17:17 - uh he said he suggested that okay use
17:19 - your framework
17:20 - to build that right and i was like okay
17:22 - i was literally googling how to
17:24 - build python application a web
17:26 - application because
17:27 - it was a web application then i
17:28 - discovered django man and i i literally
17:31 - for i was there almost uh three months i
17:34 - literally learned like
17:35 - a very solid uh jungle base
17:39 - i would say and i rebuilt the whole
17:40 - thing for them and in the end they were
17:42 - really
17:42 - uh really happy with that so i
17:44 - accomplished my internship
17:46 - that's crazy so you rebuilt their whole
17:48 - project so basically they initially they
17:50 - give you
17:51 - they give this to you in java and you're
17:53 - like holy i literally can't do this
17:54 - which
17:55 - by the way i just want to say it takes a
17:56 - lot of gusts to come to to come up to
17:58 - someone and say i can't do it
18:00 - right the problem becomes is a lot of
18:02 - people say that
18:03 - oh i can't i can't i can't i can't do
18:04 - right and they get into this mindset of
18:07 - being afraid to say that something they
18:09 - can't and so they lie
18:11 - and they lie and the thing is that
18:13 - people on the other hand
18:15 - they can see you lying so badly
18:18 - sometimes like because i do interviews
18:20 - with a lot of people right
18:21 - and i can see when people lie like i
18:24 - interview people
18:24 - interview developers i can see when
18:26 - you're lying
18:28 - i'll sometimes in my mind i just want to
18:30 - say listen just tell me you don't know
18:32 - or just tell me that you can't and we'll
18:35 - figure this out together
18:37 - you see what i mean and it's a sad part
18:39 - about this
18:41 - right but it's all about communication
18:44 - right
18:44 - it's all about communication exactly
18:46 - what it is very brave you went ahead and
18:48 - you actually basically you told them hey
18:49 - you know what
18:50 - i'm going to go ahead and say i can't do
18:53 - this but here's the solution but we can
18:55 - try in a different
18:56 - manner so we actually came up with a
18:58 - different solution right which was
19:00 - the jingle with python correct and i
19:03 - rebuilded the whole thing
19:04 - from scratch because again he already
19:06 - had a coast base in the spring
19:07 - and i had to extend that i was like
19:09 - there's no way i'll extend that so i'll
19:11 - build
19:11 - whole thing which was already there from
19:13 - scratch and then on top of that i'll bet
19:15 - on other features and yeah
19:17 - through those months it worked out and
19:19 - it was really good because we just had a
19:21 - date daily meetings when he was just
19:23 - talking about those features and i was
19:24 - like brainstorming with him man like
19:26 - it's been
19:27 - the best experience in my life uh
19:30 - regarding like starting a job as a
19:31 - as a developer it really gave me that
19:33 - boost later on in the
19:34 - getting the new job like i've never had
19:36 - a problem to get a new job
19:38 - because after that when i quit uh
19:40 - university because like that's a funny
19:41 - story that right after this internship
19:43 - i remember you quit university is that
19:45 - correct yeah
19:46 - right after this internship i came back
19:49 - to university
19:50 - and man it's been so boring because i
19:52 - had all of this experience being
19:54 - abroad alone meeting those people
19:56 - working the international
19:57 - team uh also like man i i earned
20:01 - in the end almost 6k like i've never
20:03 - earned money before in my life and then
20:05 - it's just 6k like that it was it was
20:07 - just crazy for me
20:08 - of course i had to pay for like a flood
20:11 - and so on
20:12 - but it was all worth it for all those
20:13 - experiences
20:15 - [Music]
20:17 - yeah but then being in a university uh
20:20 - on all of those like uh
20:21 - classes and so on i just couldn't stand
20:23 - it anymore because i already started
20:25 - working in the industry
20:26 - and i saw what is necessary to build
20:28 - stuff give value to companies
20:30 - and then they will learn they were
20:32 - teaching us this all and i was like
20:34 - man i can't stand it i was talking to my
20:36 - friend literally i was shaking
20:37 - and i was like man i can't i can't be
20:39 - here i can't stand it i don't know what
20:40 - i will do i
20:41 - i just don't want to be here and at some
20:43 - point i stood up and i just went
20:45 - like sorry what were you learning there
20:49 - like i can't stand it yeah we we were
20:50 - learning java
20:52 - so again java and there was like some
20:54 - old libraries
20:55 - object programming languages uh then
20:59 - like very like we didn't even touch web
21:01 - dev there was like the next year
21:03 - and there was like a lot of those boring
21:06 - uh usual
21:06 - useless subjects with like building some
21:10 - things from like this micro
21:11 - electro like i can i don't know it's the
21:14 - english name for it but you just had to
21:16 - connect a few cables and build some
21:18 - stuff just like man i wasn't interested
21:19 - in this at all i wanted to learn
21:21 - a tools how to program i wanted to
21:25 - new new and the newest frameworks that
21:28 - was another case that they were
21:29 - teaching you all of those old frameworks
21:31 - because they couldn't
21:32 - uh hire professors who are also
21:35 - developers who are working the industry
21:37 - right
21:38 - so this this knowledge i just realized
21:41 - it's all useless of course you will you
21:42 - will
21:43 - get through all of those very tough
21:45 - algorithms
21:46 - and by finishing this university to be
21:49 - honest you will just learn how to learn
21:51 - anything in your freaking life right so
21:52 - once you get the
21:53 - job in the company you'll just survive
21:55 - there because man you just
21:56 - learn the toughest in your college
21:58 - so you will survive of course this is
22:00 - how it works but why don't take a
22:02 - shortcut if you know what to do
22:04 - so i was also passionate about business
22:06 - side always like my whole life
22:08 - and it was never introduced there like
22:11 - at all never zero
22:12 - zero like i always wanted to talk about
22:14 - numbers
22:15 - and stuff like this yeah there was
22:17 - nothing to do like that so i really
22:18 - wanted to
22:19 - get straight into industry so that's why
22:21 - i literally quit
22:22 - then i landed two jobs i picked one and
22:25 - it was like yeah
22:26 - let's go that's awesome i mean look i
22:28 - think that's amazing because like
22:29 - even it just shows that how much what
22:31 - you can do with so
22:33 - little experience right there are jobs
22:35 - that will take you with little
22:36 - experience
22:37 - a lot of you guys and those are in the
22:38 - comments right
22:40 - let us know in the comments if you're
22:42 - somebody who's looking for a job or
22:43 - maybe you
22:44 - want to become a developer right and
22:46 - you're just you're
22:48 - you don't know where to go you're
22:49 - confused right maybe a situation maybe
22:51 - you're stuck in tutorial hell you don't
22:52 - know where to go right
22:54 - whatever it might be let us know in the
22:55 - comments below right but
22:57 - what jacob here can tell you is that
23:00 - even though you might not have
23:01 - much experience there's companies out
23:03 - there that will help you out that will
23:05 - take care of you
23:06 - right the they give you the opportunity
23:08 - let me ask you this question okay
23:11 - why do you think they hired you
23:15 - i think it was uh about my approach they
23:17 - really
23:18 - see that i won it like right now they
23:20 - still
23:21 - they really they really saw that i have
23:23 - the guts to quit university and like
23:25 - work and learn the industry more i also
23:27 - told them and
23:28 - just like the encoding interview because
23:31 - i also had to pass the coding interview
23:33 - so
23:33 - it was a job also related to django
23:36 - because i already know the basics but
23:37 - man it's it's been nothing like
23:39 - the stuff i learned here there in the
23:41 - company it was all i
23:42 - learned so i literally didn't know the
23:44 - difference between get and post requests
23:46 - but i just made the app work at some
23:48 - point man when i check
23:49 - the code base it's also my github man
23:52 - it's
23:53 - it's really messy like i didn't know
23:55 - what to do at all they
23:56 - there was like four and a four into four
23:58 - into four like literally
24:01 - oh yeah that was like that in the
24:02 - beginning so then when i
24:04 - was on the coding interview there was a
24:06 - framework to django which just is
24:08 - responsible for building the api which
24:10 - is django res framework and they were
24:12 - coding mostly into that because they had
24:13 - there was a separate team for front and
24:15 - back end right so you just
24:17 - were about to build back-end so they
24:19 - gave me a task
24:20 - and i was like the same i was writing
24:22 - documentation checking the examples
24:24 - and i spent one day with them uh and i
24:27 - solved
24:28 - i solved the whole thing how they wanted
24:30 - but of course it wasn't it wasn't right
24:32 - but they saw this potential how fast i
24:34 - can learn and how good i can communicate
24:36 - with the team because this is also
24:37 - a case that whenever you are freaking
24:40 - good at coding it doesn't mean you are
24:41 - freaking good developer because good
24:44 - developers like
24:46 - when i hire people right now what i
24:47 - really care is not how good you code but
24:49 - how good
24:50 - you can communicate uh especially from
24:53 - the business side
24:54 - when i have when i have a client here's
24:55 - an idea and he wants to talk to
24:57 - developer there's no way
24:58 - they will talk to each other there's no
25:00 - way um they
25:02 - they speak literally at different
25:03 - languages
25:06 - right and it's not just about how good
25:08 - you can code it's also about how good
25:10 - you can smash that like button
25:15 - smash that like button button for the
25:17 - youtube algorithm right that also
25:19 - matters
25:20 - but yeah like it's not just about how
25:22 - well you can i
25:24 - really like the pension that's really
25:25 - cool that was graham stefan type
25:27 - situation you know
25:28 - um yeah yeah yeah so basically you know
25:32 - it's like um
25:33 - it's not just about how good you can
25:34 - cope it's all about your passion and
25:36 - about
25:36 - how good you can learn correct well you
25:39 - show them the fact that
25:40 - you are willing to learn
25:43 - right but what i'm curious that's
25:44 - totally true what's up
25:46 - go ahead uh yeah that's not really true
25:48 - but i also wanted to mention one thing
25:49 - which you
25:50 - brought which is a coding uh tutorial
25:52 - and pro
25:53 - pro like project cell and so on this is
25:55 - why i also really wanted to
25:57 - because at this point i had a gap year
25:58 - right because i quit a university and i
26:00 - wanted to go abroad so i applied to this
26:02 - university where i'm currently but i
26:03 - wanted to work
26:04 - for all time to get the experience and i
26:07 - could
26:08 - choose two ways right i could choose a
26:10 - first way when i just learn technologies
26:12 - i learn
26:13 - and build projects right so i go
26:15 - tutorial of the tutorial but man
26:17 - i don't think it's the case to really
26:19 - get experience you really need to work
26:21 - inside that commercial project because
26:24 - this is where the real users are
26:25 - and they give you the feedback so it's
26:27 - totally different way i i don't
26:29 - recommend you guys
26:30 - like literally don't build project after
26:32 - project
26:34 - my approach is that literally getting to
26:36 - freelancing if you can't land
26:38 - a job and try to build something for
26:40 - someone because this will
26:42 - bring you a lot of experience you will
26:44 - really learn how to
26:46 - uh like build tough stuff and you will
26:48 - be under pressure
26:50 - that's what i would choose right now for
26:52 - about to start
26:53 - yeah now i would just tell to somebody
26:56 - who was like
26:58 - it's wanted to say hey no you go ahead
26:59 - and start out with very simply like just
27:01 - like this it's one thing to say that
27:03 - but it's a whole other thing to actually
27:06 - go ahead
27:06 - and and actually do it that's the
27:09 - hardest thing because a lot of people
27:10 - feel like well you know what
27:12 - i'm not ready they have the imposter
27:13 - syndrome and it makes sense because you
27:15 - really are not ready you don't know the
27:17 - the knowledge behind it right so what
27:20 - kind of a mindset do you have to have to
27:22 - be like no no i'm gonna get started no
27:23 - matter what
27:24 - and i kind of see where it takes me
27:26 - because i interviewed blake connolly as
27:28 - well and he had that same mindset
27:31 - right he started kind of freelancing
27:33 - very much from the get-go without
27:35 - thinking about so much
27:36 - about you know the future instead he
27:39 - just kind of still
27:40 - started to start doing the work and then
27:42 - after that he just kind of learned on
27:44 - the fly
27:46 - exactly i mean there are different kind
27:47 - of people so there are people who just
27:49 - prefer to
27:50 - learn learn learn and just talk about it
27:52 - and there are people who
27:54 - in order to learn they just act they
27:56 - learn through experience and this is my
27:58 - way to do it and
27:59 - i can only say the same regarding the
28:02 - current business which we run right
28:03 - which we go
28:04 - to uh soon again like same story so
28:08 - about coding now it's also about like
28:10 - calisthenics which i'm doing
28:11 - before i was just reading about
28:13 - exercising that but at some point i just
28:15 - sign up for like very
28:16 - experienced group when man like i work
28:19 - with the people who are doing
28:20 - calisthenics for like five seven years
28:22 - i'm the worst there but it's been the
28:24 - best experience ever
28:26 - i mean i'm every day i feel like i i'm
28:28 - literally dying i can't get up from bed
28:30 - but it's the best
28:31 - so really whenever you do in your life
28:35 - i would whenever you want to accomplish
28:37 - something in your life i would literally
28:39 - do it by like accomplish it by doing
28:42 - no matter what does it take of course
28:44 - you will fail and you'll feel very bad
28:46 - in a lot of moment but this is where the
28:48 - all growth comes
28:49 - right yeah that is true that is true i
28:52 - agree i give failure is a big very big
28:54 - part
28:54 - of growth you know we need to do that
28:56 - before we move on so so
28:58 - i understand so you went basically you
28:59 - went to this company correct and this
29:01 - what do you know the name of this
29:02 - company yeah it's kv software company in
29:05 - poznan and i
29:06 - if anyone from the kiwi watches me i
29:08 - greet you guys it's been
29:10 - great time there i mean i got so much
29:13 - experience from it like literally been
29:14 - it's been the best thing that happened
29:16 - to me
29:17 - wow that's amazing this has a lot to say
29:19 - that that's amazing
29:20 - awesome so now in that case that's cool
29:23 - now in that case
29:24 - so after that right you went to this
29:26 - internship and then
29:27 - what kind of happened then right you're
29:29 - working the jingle project how
29:31 - how did you feel now at this point
29:33 - working and like
29:34 - how do you feel like your knowledge was
29:36 - at a point after like a month or two of
29:38 - working in the company
29:39 - i mean it's the first internship so i
29:41 - when i finished internship to be honest
29:43 - yeah i was all shitty
29:44 - still but i had the experience then the
29:46 - company i worked there almost a year
29:47 - and yeah after this year i i was really
29:50 - solid to be honest because it was just
29:52 - djangour's framework all the time um
29:55 - yeah at this point i felt very solid
29:57 - it's still like i
29:58 - i couldn't say i'm the the expert right
30:02 - but it was also a small company that was
30:04 - what was the beautiful thing about that
30:06 - because we just had to get done
30:09 - and most of the times i was literally
30:11 - putting to the huge project and i had to
30:14 - do stuff so it was also a great
30:16 - experience for me
30:17 - and after that like when i moved to
30:19 - germany i also applied
30:20 - uh so then i also like get to the next
30:22 - university and i applied to different
30:24 - companies the funny part is in germany
30:26 - when you're a student you can only work
30:28 - uh 20 hours per week this is a german
30:30 - law really on the contract student on a
30:32 - contract
30:32 - so interesting now it's different
30:35 - because i own my
30:36 - compa own company um so it's different
30:39 - uh so you're a baller now you're like
30:40 - i don't play with the rules now now i
30:43 - mean i just still have to
30:45 - say that i work 20 hours per week
30:46 - because you can't really tell
30:48 - that's a trick in germany
30:51 - i mean right now i have two companies to
30:53 - be honest so one is there's a poland
30:55 - when i'm the
30:55 - co-founder like co-owner and then the
30:57 - second single person company in germany
31:00 - when i just do invoices and stuff and
31:03 - so that's how we run it right now but
31:05 - let me tell you about the
31:06 - the funny story about the companies when
31:10 - i applied as a student so i got
31:12 - this university and i already had like a
31:14 - nice experience to get at the company so
31:16 - i applied already to
31:17 - as a mid developer everywhere uh full
31:20 - time
31:20 - and i was going for different uh coding
31:23 - interviews men they were
31:24 - really tough but there was a those these
31:26 - were like positions for like 60 70k
31:29 - euros
31:30 - a year and i passed through different uh
31:33 - coding interviews
31:34 - and there was like the last uh stage
31:37 - when i had to go only through hr thing
31:40 - uh hr interview and man it was all great
31:43 - it was all perfect and in the end i said
31:45 - hey do you have an option to like work
31:48 - 20 hours per week because you see i'm a
31:49 - student
31:51 - and they were shocked they were
31:53 - literally shocked they literally
31:55 - declined me there
31:56 - so at some point i applied also for a
31:58 - different company when they also had
32:00 - their student offer
32:02 - but i got like much more uh salary than
32:04 - a regular student because i applied for
32:06 - also like a different position that was
32:08 - like a
32:09 - tricky hack that i did but again after
32:11 - like
32:12 - seven to eight months i think that was
32:14 - also like a clever programmer
32:16 - uh and then team of clever programmer
32:18 - then i was also like a little bit
32:19 - freelancing
32:20 - at some point as i you remember probably
32:23 - this day i
32:24 - i came up when i called and i said hey
32:25 - guys it's been a great time but
32:28 - i just can't do it anymore because it's
32:31 - like i'm doing almost three jobs
32:33 - i'm studying and
32:36 - it's i just can't i just wanna quit
32:38 - everything yeah
32:39 - restart my whole brain and i already
32:42 - knew that
32:43 - i love business and i want to do
32:44 - something with business yeah
32:46 - so i took vacation yeah yeah and i
32:49 - remember i remember this like
32:51 - uh i remember this very clearly right
32:53 - because
32:54 - you were doing a lot of things you're
32:55 - working with us right you're working
32:57 - with us and
32:58 - you know you're working with us on you
33:00 - know with profit python
33:01 - and of course and just and a lot of
33:04 - different things like challenges and so
33:06 - forth
33:06 - um which was amazing of course and
33:09 - you're a big part of the team
33:11 - um but i know you were doing a lot of
33:13 - different things you had you had an
33:14 - internship that you were working at the
33:15 - same time right
33:16 - plus this also and i think you also did
33:19 - school is that correct or no you're not
33:21 - yeah exactly exactly and also like my
33:23 - own youtube and my own instagram man
33:24 - i've been like
33:25 - it's been like crazy every day like 11
33:28 - 12 hours but but you know what sometimes
33:30 - you gotta do a lot because like
33:32 - you know a lot of people problems is
33:34 - they don't do enough you see what i mean
33:39 - you're doing a lot correct and you can
33:40 - and then you figure out how to slow down
33:44 - is that correct exactly right exactly i
33:46 - just had to reflect on myself because i
33:48 - knew
33:48 - that when you do everything you can't do
33:52 - everything good right so i was like i
33:55 - have so many ideas
33:57 - i wanted to do business i love also like
33:59 - being on a team record
34:01 - videos uh coach other people also i love
34:04 - to code but
34:05 - i just can't do anything there's not
34:07 - enough time and i will just burn out
34:09 - at some point i already had a couple of
34:10 - burnouts uh not like a huge burners but
34:13 - like i just couldn't
34:14 - look at the screen anymore right so yeah
34:16 - i took the decision it's been very tough
34:19 - uh because like i literally quit
34:21 - everything and one day
34:22 - that was very hard what is everything
34:24 - everything what do you mean by
34:25 - everything
34:26 - yeah so i quit working for this one
34:28 - client
34:29 - i quit uh this part-time job in the
34:32 - company i also like i
34:33 - i was like they really liked me i really
34:35 - like it was a really great team
34:36 - so and they're also working with you
34:38 - guys it was also like very
34:40 - uh like nice experience for me i really
34:43 - love that
34:44 - yeah i just show up on every like
34:45 - meeting and i just had to say that
34:47 - yeah this is how it is i i quit and then
34:50 - i had like literally two weeks
34:52 - do enough and just chill and it was
34:54 - great it was really necessary
34:56 - and then of course at some point you
34:58 - just if you do so many things that you
35:00 - take vacation at some point
35:02 - you you are so chill that those ideas
35:04 - are coming again to you right you are so
35:06 - relaxed and men
35:08 - that was a first idea when which was
35:10 - born that i wanna be a freelancer right
35:12 - now i think it's a great thing to do
35:14 - then my co-founder wojtek he had the
35:17 - same idea that he would quit his job
35:19 - he will become a freelancer and then at
35:21 - this point it was so funny because we
35:23 - were like
35:23 - hey man i mean we can freelance together
35:25 - hey isn't it like agency or something
35:32 - maybe we could do something together who
35:34 - knows exactly so we
35:36 - team up and man it that was just the
35:38 - beginning it was it was great
35:40 - that's awesome that's awesome and so
35:42 - hold on so i kind of want to kind of
35:44 - want to even step back a little bit from
35:45 - that right because like
35:46 - you went into this right and you kind of
35:50 - quit everything that you were doing
35:51 - right
35:52 - all these different jobs and so forth
35:54 - and
35:55 - was it really because you want to do
35:57 - something different or was it because
35:59 - you were just tired and needed a break
36:03 - it wasn't really about being tired i
36:05 - could i could do that
36:06 - um definitely it was just something in
36:09 - my
36:10 - inside me talking to myself that i want
36:12 - to build something on my own
36:14 - i just i don't know i just felt this
36:17 - this way that whenever
36:18 - i work on something i just i love that
36:20 - it's it's like
36:21 - mine it's for example right i built my
36:24 - own instagram
36:25 - even though i was doing doing a lot of
36:27 - things for clever programming i was
36:28 - still doing this because
36:29 - it felt like it's literally like my
36:31 - thing it's it's me it's my personal
36:33 - brand
36:33 - and now company same thing right now of
36:36 - course we are doing custom projects for
36:38 - a client so it's like kind of
36:40 - we still have a boss our boss our our
36:43 - bosses are our clients
36:44 - i would say so right it's it's we
36:47 - exchange time for money for them but at
36:50 - the same time
36:51 - we are building a brand self-made
36:54 - and we are building the crm we are
36:56 - building a client base so whenever we
36:58 - have i don't know in three years let's
37:00 - say 100 clients
37:01 - this is recurring income already right
37:03 - the maintenance the new features this is
37:05 - this is already a thing we are building
37:07 - a developer team
37:09 - uh designer team this is all like a
37:11 - asset
37:12 - for us uh so go ahead
37:16 - yeah this is like a different like my
37:18 - mindset this is why i really enjoy that
37:19 - i really feel that i wanna do something
37:21 - like that
37:22 - that's awesome that's amazing and so
37:24 - okay so then you decide to basically
37:25 - quit everything
37:26 - you and you're like you know what i'm
37:27 - gonna start a software agency okay
37:30 - so let's get into that right what
37:33 - happened there
37:34 - how did you get started what are the
37:36 - first things that you
37:37 - did to go ahead and get started on
37:39 - something like this tell me
37:41 - man it's been a mess so i photo so i i
37:44 - already had like
37:45 - 30 or 40 000 instagram followers
37:48 - like three thousand youtube youtuber
37:50 - right and i was like wow i know a lot
37:52 - about marketing
37:54 - it it would be probably easy to get the
37:56 - first clients and so on man i would be
37:57 - killing it
37:58 - i was so like i know cocky
38:03 - yeah okay yeah maybe also
38:06 - uh but no to be honest man it's been
38:09 - much
38:10 - harder than i thought like it turned out
38:11 - that instagram or other social medias
38:14 - they are usually usually perfect for
38:16 - b2c which is a business to clients so
38:18 - when you have a product
38:20 - and you sell them to typical people
38:22 - those are your clients then it's not
38:23 - customers
38:24 - and customers yeah yeah then it's
38:27 - usually also the product is not that
38:28 - expensive
38:29 - uh but you can scale it easily but when
38:32 - you
38:32 - run your agency then you do bit b2b
38:35 - which is business to business
38:36 - business to business and i did a
38:39 - research i checked the agency so it's
38:40 - like hey man they have no instagrams
38:41 - they know facebook but then they have
38:43 - those big brands working with i was like
38:45 - how do they do that right and then i
38:46 - started re reading about it and i was
38:48 - like wow b2b
38:50 - is totally different game i have no idea
38:52 - about that and
38:53 - also like the thing where we started the
38:56 - agency with wojtek
38:57 - uh we both had savings for like two
39:00 - maybe three months
39:01 - because i also pay for my uni i pay for
39:03 - my flood and stuff like this
39:04 - so yeah i had some savings it was also
39:07 - like why i quit was like okay now i
39:09 - literally have a savings
39:11 - for next two three months so
39:14 - i really i mean i will figure it out
39:16 - because i know myself under the pressure
39:18 - if i have this pressure
39:19 - and yeah at some point i won't have any
39:21 - money i mean man
39:22 - yeah i would go back to different job
39:24 - like i have this safety that i can
39:26 - always come back to the job but now i
39:28 - want to do something more
39:29 - so this is how it was born and yeah
39:31 - we're just starting to asking people
39:33 - literally hey you are freelancers we
39:35 - want to be freelancers or like agency
39:38 - so you start getting go ahead yes
39:41 - yeah as well as to say uh who and uh
39:43 - stuff like this so like that was the
39:44 - first step
39:45 - like reading online articles how to
39:48 - freelance how to the clients
39:50 - and then also literally talking to the
39:52 - people and i'm not gonna
39:53 - i'm not gonna lie uh actually blake
39:55 - connelly was
39:56 - one of my best inspirations because like
39:59 - i knew already uh him from instagram
40:01 - like i knew that you guys were working
40:02 - together i literally asked him for like
40:04 - one
40:05 - quick interview for like 20 30 minutes
40:07 - and he agreed on that which is like
40:09 - crazy like i literally was like willing
40:11 - to pay him for this time because i know
40:13 - how much he works how many important
40:15 - things he has to do
40:16 - and yeah he agreed and then he
40:18 - introduced us the upwork
40:19 - the upwork whole upwork game and he said
40:22 - it will be very hard like
40:24 - he mentioned that a couple of times but
40:26 - we we still didn't really believe that
40:28 - it can be that hard and then we
40:29 - went to our pork man
40:33 - it's been so hard like like literally we
40:36 - actually had like both this
40:37 - nice experience is almost like 2.5
40:40 - almost three years of experience working
40:42 - the industry
40:43 - right and we went to upwork and man to
40:45 - lend our first client
40:48 - it's been literally like a grinding like
40:50 - 20 days
40:51 - 5 to 10 proposals every single day wow
40:54 - and we couldn't even get to anyone
40:57 - to answer our proposal because on upwork
41:00 - you have
41:00 - a few stages so first you need to find a
41:02 - client you need to send him the proposal
41:05 - he need to text you back then you kind
41:07 - of get on a call
41:08 - and then you have to close him so it's
41:10 - like a long process right to close
41:11 - someone
41:12 - and all and whenever someone um
41:15 - like posts a job
41:19 - offer um like after like one hour i
41:22 - don't think it's even worth to apply
41:23 - applying there because there's like
41:24 - already 20 other people applied right
41:27 - so it's very hard it's very hard to be
41:29 - noticed especially in the beginning
41:30 - where you have no badges
41:31 - no job successes no income earned
41:34 - there's like
41:35 - literally the hardest part on upwork so
41:37 - wow
41:38 - we made it actually we made it after i
41:40 - don't know two or three weeks
41:42 - um i landed the first guy it was
41:45 - something about
41:46 - amazon automation it was the first time
41:49 - first client and it was like okay i
41:51 - have no idea about amazon
41:53 - automation that they have api i was like
41:55 - i'm doing this
41:56 - i'm doing this so we got on a call
41:58 - figure it out he told me
42:00 - yeah yeah i will figure it out man i
42:01 - have to um so he told me about this
42:04 - amazon nws thing there was like a
42:06 - documentation
42:07 - he said what he wants there's also
42:09 - something about gcp which is google out
42:11 - platform
42:12 - and i was like okay let's do it and yeah
42:14 - i was working extremely hard for like
42:17 - two or three weeks and i earned like
42:18 - five hundred dollars which is like
42:20 - literally nothing as a developer for
42:21 - this kind of time but man
42:23 - i mean that's a thing right right
42:27 - sorry 500 in two weeks
42:31 - almost free so it was very tough working
42:34 - like crazy but man
42:35 - i've never was happier like that was
42:38 - literally like this 500 dollars fit like
42:41 - i know
42:42 - 10k right now or something like that
42:43 - it's it's been crazy
42:45 - how happy i was was because then i had a
42:47 - very nice comment on my profile
42:49 - uh 100 job succeed and i also got some
42:52 - batch from upwork
42:54 - so so so so tell me this tell me this
42:56 - okay what do you think allowed you to
42:58 - get this client okay
43:00 - like what was it is it the proposal that
43:03 - you made because of course you've been
43:04 - in proposals for the best to pass two
43:06 - three weeks at this point right
43:07 - but what you what got you that client
43:10 - tell me
43:11 - uh so yeah there are a couple of things
43:13 - tonight this is also how i like
43:14 - learned for to them this is actually
43:17 - after two weeks because we already like
43:18 - even buy those
43:20 - points on upwork that you can actually
43:21 - send more proposals so like we spend
43:23 - like 10 bucks or 20 bucks
43:24 - to even land a client uh so yeah what we
43:27 - learned uh
43:28 - in the beginning is that that your
43:30 - proposal needs to be extremely unique
43:32 - and gives a lot of value in the
43:34 - beginning like literally
43:36 - we kind of figure out this formula that
43:38 - when you send the up
43:40 - upwork proposal in this proposal you
43:43 - kind of need to give the guy solution
43:44 - so once we apply this pattern it really
43:48 - started working out like literally we
43:49 - got like 50 uh
43:51 - answers after that so the guy wanted to
43:53 - do some google amazon nws
43:55 - i sent him the python library
43:58 - link to github that hey this is a pi
44:00 - this library i think we can
44:02 - use that and then i think we can deploy
44:04 - the app on the gcp
44:05 - and i also link this stuff and yeah i
44:08 - just wrote him like that and he was like
44:10 - oh man you look like you have some kind
44:11 - of experience
44:12 - there and there let's talk and then he
44:14 - he got on a talk with me
44:15 - i talked about the experience and
44:17 - situation man
44:19 - because he said yeah i i'm not gonna lie
44:20 - it's like you are new here you don't
44:22 - have any
44:23 - uh stars and anything i'm kind of like i
44:26 - don't know if i should trust you but i
44:27 - mean looks like you you're fine so let's
44:30 - do it
44:30 - so he also i was lucky i was lucky he
44:32 - also wanted to help me
44:34 - right and the same happened to vojtec
44:35 - when we both applied this formula so we
44:37 - kind of get on upward i don't know maybe
44:39 - to 10
44:40 - 000 overall earnings but at some point
44:43 - we didn't really like it
44:44 - and the reason is that from my point
44:47 - because i i didn't really like it
44:48 - because
44:49 - uh i'm really shitty when it comes to
44:51 - texting like writing
44:52 - to people i'm better with talking and
44:56 - on upwork you have to be really good at
44:57 - texting so voider at some point was
44:59 - getting a lot of
45:00 - different clients but i couldn't so i
45:03 - was like okay let's switch
45:05 - the model business model again
45:08 - and then uh our second stage of this
45:12 - but before before you go into that
45:13 - before you go into that okay
45:15 - so you were doing upwork and so forth
45:17 - and you said that you were able to earn
45:19 - around ten thousand dollars on upwork is
45:21 - that what you said
45:22 - um it was in the first month overall
45:24 - overall because we are doing this upper
45:26 - thing also
45:27 - from time so we have like uh me and
45:28 - voitek together i think it might be 10k
45:30 - but
45:31 - probably less but yeah this is we got it
45:34 - after like two or three months so we
45:36 - could literally do it
45:37 - all the time but only the reason why uh
45:40 - i didn't want to do it because i had to
45:41 - text to people and i had it so
45:44 - overall nothing against upwork i think
45:45 - it's a great platform especially for
45:47 - freelancers also if you want to
45:49 - do an agency it's really good like we
45:51 - could be a really good agency there
45:52 - i know that blake earns like crazy on
45:55 - upwork and it works
45:56 - uh but yeah again it depends on the
45:58 - personality uh
46:00 - i prefer to go to people i prefer to
46:02 - meet people in person
46:04 - in order to close them um i feel like
46:06 - also i'm much better in this so
46:08 - that's why we changed that that comes to
46:10 - me to another question because
46:12 - somebody asked for they asked why don't
46:14 - you look for clients locally
46:18 - yeah this is another this is actually
46:20 - stage two of uh
46:21 - self-made so yeah this is what we did so
46:25 - we asked okay how can we get clients
46:28 - again so
46:28 - i already had couple of nice connections
46:31 - on actually through
46:32 - which i made through instagram in berlin
46:34 - and people were freelancing or they own
46:36 - their own agencies and i was going to
46:37 - them and i was just talking to them
46:39 - uh and there was hendrick from milli and
46:42 - he always talked to me that hey man
46:44 - try to reach out to your network but my
46:46 - problem is that
46:47 - i just moved to berlin right like one
46:50 - year ago or something i was starting
46:51 - then the corona
46:52 - started i didn't have any network at all
46:55 - my parents are not
46:57 - any like i.t technicians or anything my
46:59 - mother is the teacher
47:00 - so they know nothing we don't have any
47:03 - connection poland
47:04 - uh but also like we didn't want to do it
47:06 - in poland at this point
47:07 - we just wanted to be here in germany and
47:10 - work for german clients so
47:11 - yeah we didn't have any network but i
47:13 - was like okay let's do it anyway
47:15 - and then i literally was going online on
47:17 - different slack communities especially
47:19 - like the
47:19 - co-working space which i i'm right now
47:21 - and i was talking to people a lot
47:23 - and then those guys they got to us
47:26 - and we started the first collaboration
47:28 - then there was a second guy who
47:30 - reached out to us uh he was working for
47:32 - some company who is doing a hand
47:34 - handmade letters but they are actually
47:37 - created by a machine
47:39 - so it's very interesting business model
47:40 - yeah so we built they also project for
47:42 - them
47:42 - and then once you actually uh
47:46 - build a great project for someone and
47:48 - also for net like
47:49 - you shouldn't be very expensive in the
47:51 - beginning you should
47:52 - provide as much value as you can this is
47:54 - as you can this is the
47:55 - most important thing when landing your
47:57 - first clients
47:58 - i mean overall like always like the
48:01 - value is
48:01 - the most important that's what what
48:03 - might what do you have
48:05 - what mindset do you have when you go
48:08 - into for example to talk with the client
48:12 - um so they at this point they were all
48:14 - recommended right so
48:15 - we already knew that they want some kind
48:17 - of the project we proposed them the
48:19 - solution for that we say how we can do
48:20 - that and we agreed on some prices and
48:22 - those prices are
48:23 - really low uh because we just wanted to
48:25 - start
48:26 - so those are projects for like 2.5 or 3k
48:29 - uh euros i mean it's not like they are
48:32 - very low but if you run your business
48:35 - you have to pay
48:36 - taxes on your own and taxes in german is
48:38 - like half percent
48:39 - uh like 50 so in the end it's like very
48:42 - shitty like
48:43 - still if we are just doing uh nine to
48:45 - five as developers it's like
48:47 - most more like just profitable no stress
48:49 - nothing right but we just
48:51 - wanted to do that anyway so we built
48:53 - those things for those two guys
48:55 - and this is how it started because at
48:56 - this point like the guy was the ceo
48:59 - of this company and he has a lot of
49:00 - different network connections
49:02 - so he recommended us to other guys and
49:04 - this is how he kind of started there in
49:05 - germany
49:06 - also the second guy he also landed some
49:08 - clients he already had
49:10 - nice experience working with us so he
49:12 - gave us another product and meanwhile we
49:14 - are also searching for other people
49:16 - in other places so this is how we do it
49:19 - uh when you say searching what do you
49:21 - mean by searching
49:24 - like locally around you
49:27 - yes like with the same with the same uh
49:30 - model so we
49:31 - go on those communities we say that hey
49:33 - we are agency
49:35 - uh we looking for a project and so on we
49:37 - are happy to talk about some automation
49:39 - ideas and stuff like this
49:40 - uh even though at some point we uh
49:44 - we wanted to get into the niches so our
49:46 - first niche where we wanted to get in
49:48 - was the
49:49 - marketing niche because we already did
49:50 - like a lot of automations with like
49:52 - shopify
49:53 - amazon ad spent uh we aggregate
49:56 - aggregated the data we displayed in
49:58 - google sheets
49:59 - and we will and then i started literally
50:01 - talking to
50:02 - agency owners i asked them for literally
50:04 - an interview and asked them for their
50:05 - processes
50:06 - and they were getting me a data for free
50:08 - because it wasn't a sales call
50:10 - they just literally were talking okay we
50:12 - are using this software
50:13 - i think in this server this sucks i know
50:15 - literally noting this all down building
50:16 - my own
50:17 - database but at the same time we didn't
50:20 - really know if we want to do it so we
50:21 - are just kind of getting
50:23 - clients i would say randomly because of
50:26 - other connections
50:27 - they were just approaching us so we are
50:29 - really lucky at this point
50:30 - and i would do like a quick um
50:34 - like a time travel to the point where
50:36 - are we right now because
50:38 - literally right now at this point we are
50:40 - launching self pain self
50:41 - made 2.0 which is uh
50:44 - so i have a new co-founder the third guy
50:46 - who joined us and
50:48 - this is uh how we kind of start again
50:50 - but with the whole
50:52 - mindset which we developed over the last
50:54 - eight months so right now we are
50:55 - literally going over the one niche
50:57 - which is the automotive that's like a
51:00 - journey which we want to kind of start
51:01 - right now so it's still
51:02 - software it's still custom software as
51:05 - we do
51:06 - like right as we were doing over the
51:07 - last eight months but it's all around
51:09 - one niche
51:10 - now you're asking why it's yeah perfect
51:12 - question so
51:13 - over the last eight months we are just
51:14 - doing everything for everyone
51:16 - uh we said that we are the auto
51:19 - automation agency but in the end we also
51:21 - were building some kind of websites uh
51:24 - because we just hit the project we just
51:26 - had to take the project so we are
51:27 - learning a lot about different
51:29 - integrations
51:30 - different industries uh
51:33 - and this brought us to the moment where
51:35 - we are right now where we actually
51:37 - finally saved uh some money so
51:41 - the title which you have right
51:42 - six-figure agency is this
51:44 - is happened like literally like recently
51:48 - when we started doing this right the
51:50 - first two three months has been like 1k
51:52 - 2k 3k 4k right we are we were growing
51:55 - but over the last few months you're
51:58 - talking about like earnings like four
51:59 - keep a month two keep a month earnings
52:00 - right
52:01 - and i just make sure be very clear this
52:02 - but with you guys is
52:04 - this is okay like a lot of you guys
52:06 - think that you know
52:07 - on foreign fortunate a lot of a lot of
52:09 - developers when they go into freelancing
52:11 - like i'm gonna be a millionaire that's
52:13 - it
52:14 - i'm gonna have a lot of money i can
52:16 - travel wherever i want and this could be
52:18 - a great life
52:19 - right and unfortunately right that's not
52:21 - the case
52:22 - right because i myself have been a
52:24 - freelancer as well
52:25 - jacob here he started philanthropy of
52:27 - course as well and
52:29 - you guys can see that it is not the case
52:31 - right
52:32 - not very much the case at all because
52:35 - it's a lot of hours
52:36 - and you start out with shitty money
52:38 - potentially right yeah it's basically
52:40 - no matter how much experience you have
52:43 - right
52:44 - in terms of coding you might ask that
52:47 - with your business set up for the bottom
52:49 - because
52:50 - you have not built your reputation in
52:52 - the freelancer world initially at all
52:55 - right exactly it's a long marathon it's
52:58 - not a sprint
52:59 - exactly exactly and so now you say
53:01 - you're getting one take
53:03 - 1k 2k 3k and so just tell me now that
53:06 - when you guys were going into with focus
53:08 - on the automotive stuff
53:10 - which is when you focus on motor stuff
53:11 - give me some examples like what kind of
53:13 - projects you're building in the
53:14 - automotive industry
53:15 - exactly so we just picked this niche
53:18 - it's not like
53:19 - we are still in the research phase so in
53:21 - two three weeks when we talk to like 100
53:23 - people
53:23 - we might decide that we actually change
53:25 - change it to different one but the thing
53:27 - is
53:28 - again to the earnings right finally
53:32 - like we had this first month i think it
53:34 - was like january or february
53:36 - when we actually hit 10k that was the
53:39 - next month was 20k and it was like
53:41 -  it was it was crazy it was also
53:43 - accumulated because
53:45 - uh when you do agency when you are
53:47 - freelancer
53:48 - it's very hard to get your first
53:50 - projects people don't trust you and
53:52 - usually they don't even agree to pay
53:54 - upfront
53:55 - and they don't agree to pay hourly so we
53:58 - had this one project actually couple of
53:59 - projects that
54:00 - we are building this over four months
54:02 - and in the fourth month
54:04 - we just we just saw the money right so
54:06 - it will all the investment that we
54:07 - didn't even
54:08 - for that we'll see the money so this is
54:10 - how we also accumulated this
54:12 - but that's the best thing that i mean me
54:14 - and wojtek we were we are young and
54:16 - in order to survive for us like 2k for a
54:18 - person is enough
54:20 - um wow that's the the best size and
54:23 - that that's the best thing and now when
54:25 - we have like more
54:26 - money it changes my mindset because it's
54:29 - not like okay now i'm going to
54:31 - i don't know release a porsche right
54:32 - it's not the case
54:34 - i would never do that like i mean maybe
54:37 - somewhere in the future right but now i
54:41 - see
54:41 - the potential of it that wow i have the
54:43 - budget so
54:44 - i can literally focus on the niche do a
54:47 - research
54:48 - if i have the previous clients i can get
54:51 - a developer
54:52 - hire him he will be part of our team i
54:55 - will
54:56 - build a brand we'll actually pay for a
54:59 - marketing will pay for a content
55:01 - and do some run some ads like this is
55:03 - what a whole money will be from for
55:04 - investment in the company
55:06 - so we are finally in the moment that we
55:07 - can do it this is also why we're doing
55:09 - the whole rebranding the new logo which
55:10 - is actually on the
55:11 - thumbnail of it it's not released yet
55:13 - only on youtube
55:15 - uh the new totally new website this is
55:18 - how we will use that right so
55:20 - we just started uh those bigger numbers
55:22 - we are very excited
55:24 - um but yeah we're also very humble about
55:27 - that because it's been
55:28 - very tough eight months to be where are
55:31 - we
55:32 - and to be honest like we're just
55:34 - starting man like
55:35 - it's a long long game like um so
55:39 - yeah this is how it is it's a very long
55:42 - game right it's a
55:43 - it's an interesting game right um i've
55:46 - been this game as well of course
55:48 - um so and you guys started basically now
55:51 - doing this niche right the automotive
55:53 - niche right
55:54 - and you guys seen it you know you guys
55:56 - seen bigger numbers from previous
55:57 - projects of course now at this point
55:59 - now what are you going to do how are you
56:01 - going to reinvest the money back right
56:03 - a lot of money a lot of people they
56:05 - might might get the money they're
56:06 - invested that you might spend it
56:07 - somewhere
56:08 - what's the goal here when you go ahead
56:10 - and make money as a south agency what is
56:12 - the goal now with that money tell me
56:13 - i'm just kidding i'm a christmas tree
56:15 - because i can tell you where we spend it
56:16 - here at our company here
56:17 - yeah so i'm curious so normally whenever
56:21 - we have a project a client
56:23 - i just do everything by myself uh
56:26 - because i didn't even know how i could
56:28 - uh spend that i would want to save as
56:30 - much as i can
56:31 - but now having this mindset i can bring
56:33 - some new developer and just
56:35 - uh spend this money on him right so hire
56:38 - him
56:38 - reinvest the money even though if this
56:41 - can fail we
56:42 - we learn how to work with other people
56:43 - so it's a perfect
56:45 - learning opportunity same with ads same
56:47 - with whole marketing around that
56:50 - also i'll be able to finally not
56:53 - um just work on coding part which just
56:56 - brings money but do actually a research
56:58 - so no one will pay me for meetings like
57:00 - no one paid me for meetings before even
57:01 - with their clients right
57:02 - but now we are talking to potential
57:04 - clients we are talking to the business
57:06 - owners in automotive niche and those are
57:08 - just the meetings 30 minutes but it can
57:10 - be very very
57:11 - time consuming over like a next few few
57:14 - weeks
57:15 - so this is also like just a the safety
57:17 - net for the future for us
57:20 - to pay ourselves in the future because
57:22 - yeah
57:23 - i think that that's the difference
57:24 - between like a startup
57:26 - uh approach when you get the founding
57:28 - grounds and so on but just an
57:29 - agency uh model it's it's completely
57:32 - different
57:33 - how many how many people do you guys
57:35 - have working with you i know you
57:36 - told me on the contractor basis you guys
57:39 - have been working with how many people
57:40 - do you work with
57:40 - on a regular basis tell me yeah so right
57:43 - now we have three
57:44 - people working with plus uh two other
57:46 - founders so it's like we are a team of
57:48 - six
57:49 - but uh sometimes we have like some other
57:51 - people bring you on for like some kind
57:52 - of consultations whenever there's a
57:53 - project that we really
57:55 - uh need an expert but we kind of know
57:57 - how to build that and those experts are
57:59 - too
58:00 - uh expensive to build it we just hire
58:01 - them for consultations to
58:03 - ask uh about those things so this is
58:07 - my way that's a pretty smart so
58:08 - basically instead of hiring the person
58:10 - right the developer you hire them as a
58:12 - consultant and they keep building
58:13 - yourself so you basically get the
58:14 - knowledge from them
58:15 - but you're also not paying for the hours
58:18 - at the same time you just kind of build
58:19 - them
58:19 - by yourself basically yeah we would
58:21 - rather pay them like even 200
58:23 - uh dollars per hour right wow to
58:26 - validate our current solution which we
58:28 - work on a
58:29 - whole week rather than hire them for a
58:31 - full time because then it's like
58:32 - crazy and at this point we also can't
58:35 - charge
58:36 - clients that the crazy money um how much
58:39 - i miss this question i mean if you want
58:40 - to if you don't want to say that that's
58:41 - fine too
58:42 - how much do you how much do you on
58:43 - regular basis charge per hour for a
58:45 - client
58:46 - like it's still it's still uh it's
58:49 - we can't say uh the average because it
58:52 - really is different on the project
58:54 - uh like there's one client when we can
58:56 - charge him 30
58:57 - euros per hour then sometimes 50 but it
59:00 - all depends on the situation where are
59:01 - we at and again
59:03 - hourly pricing and fixed pricing is
59:04 - totally different game yeah
59:06 - um there is a lot of negotiating coming
59:08 - to this so it's it's very
59:10 - hard to tell how much we earn actually
59:12 - per hour because
59:14 - taking under consideration how much we
59:15 - work during a week
59:17 - it will be still i'm still we
59:20 - earn less that if we were working
59:22 - full-time as developers that i can tell
59:24 - you
59:24 - clearly because like when you work as a
59:26 - developer
59:27 - as in the company let's say eight hours
59:29 - a day then you really code for four
59:31 - hours then you have a couple of meetings
59:32 - especially right now
59:33 - remote work yeah that's my experience
59:36 - but when you work for someone else like
59:39 - he's your client then every hour really
59:41 - count because if you don't really focus
59:43 - on this hour then
59:44 - you're burning this time no one will pay
59:46 - you for that especially on the fixed
59:47 - price contract it's different approach
59:49 - so
59:50 - that's true that's true now also we
59:52 - failed so many times
59:54 - sorry i know i mean i've been there too
59:56 - honestly now do you do fixed price
59:57 - projects as well because
59:58 - when i was doing the adjustments what's
60:01 - up
60:02 - it's just fixed price it's very hard to
60:04 - even talk about oh it is just fixed
60:06 - price
60:07 - it's almost impossible to get to the
60:09 - point of hourly contracts
60:10 - like we usually wait two hours
60:14 - projects because all i hear from them is
60:16 - do not do fixed price projects
60:17 - of course but it's also almost
60:20 - impossible to
60:21 - to get hourly clients like talking to ex
60:24 - from my experience is just
60:26 - impossible so we usually have uh
60:27 - maintenance contracts for hourly
60:29 - but then we also talk about kind of like
60:31 - a fix so what does it take to fix this
60:33 - bug
60:34 - this is how it is right now maybe at
60:36 - some point we'll get to the point where
60:38 - blake is but for now it's just yeah we
60:39 - are still
60:40 - too early in this game right it's just
60:41 - eight months and now we are
60:43 - taking some serious moves regarding the
60:45 - niche um
60:47 - so that's how it is tell me what are
60:50 - some biggest things that you had to
60:52 - change within you when starting
60:54 - something like this like
60:55 - internally what did you have to change
60:57 - tell me
60:59 - um so yeah before when i was just doing
61:02 - jobs there was not really a huge
61:04 - responsibly
61:05 - responsibility on my side so whenever
61:07 - there was a feature
61:09 - for example in corporate world um i knew
61:12 - that if i don't do it for tomorrow like
61:14 - they can blame me or something but
61:15 - nothing really happens overall they have
61:17 -  tons of money and stuff like this
61:18 - i'm nothing in this
61:20 - corporate leather i knew that right and
61:23 - at some point i was
61:24 - getting very lazy because of that
61:26 - because it was like unfair advantage
61:28 - that
61:28 - i'm really good at people and if i
61:32 - really don't want to do something i
61:33 - won't do it but then i will
61:35 - like force myself to do it
61:38 - so even working in a company 20 hours
61:41 - per week i could easily do my task over
61:43 - like four to five
61:44 - hours and the whole team i was literally
61:46 - asking boss if
61:47 - it's all good they were like super proud
61:49 - and stuff like this right so
61:52 - i was literally getting bored and lazy
61:55 - at the same time which is really bad
61:57 - but here yeah as i told you already
61:59 - there's no way of
62:01 - kind of cheating there's no way because
62:03 - if you don't do
62:04 - stuff then you just don't get paid and
62:07 - yeah it's totally different
62:09 - i'm just more motivated to work than
62:11 - ever also like i love it so much that i
62:13 - always am into that like whenever i
62:15 - don't even work or code i always have
62:16 - some kind of
62:17 - business ideas that we want to develop
62:19 - so it's it's different yeah
62:21 - that's awesome so somebody asked
62:23 - somebody asked here but the rasheed
62:25 - asks what is the niche about right so
62:27 - the automotive niche right
62:29 - go a little bit deeper deeper into that
62:31 - what do you mean by that are you guys
62:32 - building you know dashboards for
62:34 - automotive
62:35 - companies what does that look like so
62:38 - yeah
62:38 - that's the thing that we uh we already
62:40 - have three projects now portfolio and
62:42 - automotive
62:42 - which are totally different so one is
62:45 - about
62:45 - uh scanning cars the vista scanning
62:49 - solutions uh company from us
62:51 - uh this is all about gathering data from
62:53 - different scans
62:54 - uh priests can post kind of um
62:56 - diagnostic scans and stuff like this
62:58 - uh so we are working there and helping
63:00 - them out a lot then
63:02 - that was like one part so it's more
63:04 - about literally a
63:06 - very specific knowledge in the industry
63:08 - of cars like all about the car parts
63:10 - um then the third one is actually uh for
63:13 - dana
63:14 - um they approached us with the scrapers
63:17 - so we had to build a very custom
63:19 - scrapers for them to cover like
63:21 - uh a competitor
63:24 - uh gaskets i'm not i can't say more
63:26 - about it because we have some contracts
63:28 - there and so on
63:28 - but this is what i might have today tell
63:31 - uh so that's the different uh
63:32 - thing so it's all about automation and
63:34 - the third guy uh that was our recent
63:36 - client we just finished the page is uh
63:39 - about he's at car dealership who's
63:41 - exporting cars from
63:42 - switzerland to poland and actually we
63:44 - built uh
63:45 - some kind of also a scrapers and
63:47 - automation tools for them
63:50 - for for them actually yeah and in the
63:52 - end they have a whole car platform when
63:54 - people from poland can bat
63:56 - cars um and they are like responsible
63:59 - just for delivering the cars and handle
64:01 - all of the
64:02 - um like payment and other stuff
64:04 - processes so it's also helping them a
64:06 - lot so those are three different
64:08 - projects but in the automotive niche so
64:10 - currently
64:11 - we are check we are asking other car
64:14 - dealerships
64:15 - if there's any way that we could maybe
64:17 - build for them or like who are they
64:19 - processing the a their company we are
64:22 - not talking the small guys more like to
64:23 - the bigger guys
64:24 - i know that there's a lot of different
64:26 - crm systems for just car dealerships
64:29 - and yeah we just in the research phase

65:29 - perfect so you guys can reach him out on
65:33 - that specific on that instagram
65:35 - i don't know why i wear myself the whole
65:36 - time because i actually think this is
65:38 - better right here
65:38 - i kind of like this when i hear better
65:40 - yeah so but anyways so
65:42 - that's really cool so that's your you're
65:44 - basically on a different automotive
65:45 - industry
65:46 - in and you're trying this nation this
65:48 - niche potentially might work out because
65:50 - you know one thing i realized that when
65:51 - i was starting to do it started
65:53 - a software agency is you get to you kind
65:55 - of have to build everything
65:57 - everything for everybody and it's not
65:59 - fun because you just diverted into
66:01 - so many different places you know
66:04 - this one part like i mean i remember
66:06 - when i was doing this i was doing
66:08 - seo i was doing you know you know
66:10 - wordpress
66:11 - i was doing literally you know jingle
66:13 - and then react js
66:14 - and like there's all these different
66:16 - projects that you have to do and
66:18 - it's just not i don't know it's just not
66:20 - fun when you do when you there's no
66:21 - niche right
66:22 - so like not focused if if there is like
66:24 - a serious big company they just want to
66:26 - work with the best and to get to the
66:27 - best you have to be the best like really
66:29 - so also like this is just start bing
66:33 - automotive agency let's say so right
66:35 - software agency for automotive
66:36 - it's not also uh deep
66:40 - enough in my opinion but this is a great
66:41 - start so the process like i mean this
66:44 - will take like next two three four years
66:46 - but i already have a next steps for it
66:49 - so
66:50 - first like that's the worst thing is
66:51 - that i myself in vojtec which we started
66:54 - like we are developers
66:55 - we have no idea about any industry
66:59 - problems and so on we just knew coding
67:02 - but at the end of the day coding is a
67:03 - tool
67:04 - so you don't really solve any business
67:06 - business cases you don't really provide
67:08 - the value that's
67:09 - why you are a developer which is totally
67:10 - perfect most of the people just want to
67:12 - be developers that's totally perfect
67:15 - um like you are basically also
67:19 - tool right you have managers above you
67:21 - which are just experts in the industry
67:23 - they know where the value comes from
67:24 - but when you start agency and you know
67:27 - nothing about the industry itself it's
67:28 - very tough so that's why
67:30 - we want to niche down do a lot of
67:32 - interviews talk to experts and then
67:34 - see how we can actually use this tool
67:36 - and help them
67:37 - and that would be the step first step so
67:40 - still
67:41 - custom coding for automotive uh
67:44 - industry and then let's say after three
67:46 - or four years when we really really
67:48 - build a lot of projects around that
67:50 - we may come to the we may come to the
67:52 - point where we have really nice team
67:54 - a really nice expert expert knowledge
67:58 - and we will change to the sas company
68:00 - because building the sas company
68:01 - is very very hard people don't earn
68:05 - money for like two three years some
68:06 - people like most of the people who are
68:08 - building sas software they have totally
68:10 - wrong approaches just going to investors
68:12 - uh getting the money and they they
68:14 - usually fail it's it's a very
68:16 - different topic but i have this health
68:19 - i would say mindset to it that we first
68:22 - tackled down a lot of different problems
68:24 - see where's actually see where is the
68:26 - potential to build the perfect sauce
68:29 - uh actually being being there already
68:31 - solve those problems and then maybe come
68:33 - up with something that we already
68:34 - uh have a clients also who are who want
68:37 - to pay for that because
68:38 - a lot of people build this sas pro like
68:40 - they build products
68:41 - then they go out and they ask for
68:43 - feedback no one's really want that right
68:44 - so they spend like eight months one year
68:47 - they do it soon they so don't see any
68:49 - money at all and they just quit because
68:51 - no one wants that
68:52 - so yeah i think this is the nice nice
68:55 - long-term vision for building a sas
68:57 - company where there's a goal because
68:59 - there's a scale for that right
69:00 - you don't have to come up with the whole
69:03 - code base
69:04 - you don't have to find clients all the
69:06 - time right it's kind of like this is
69:08 - you know do it once right it's sell sell
69:10 - it you know many times
69:11 - i think that's the bottle right for a
69:13 - sass business right um
69:14 - and i i haven't told you this but we're
69:16 - actually internally building
69:18 - something sas as well internally here
69:20 - we're building something that will help
69:22 - students a lot a lot of students that
69:23 - kind of learn
69:24 - right and work in a building internally
69:26 - to kind of use it internally within us
69:28 - and who knows they might might go out to
69:30 - multiple people at some points in the
69:31 - future
69:32 - and that's the thing because you already
69:33 - have a lot of experience in the industry
69:35 - that you know what people want right and
69:36 - you have
69:37 - a group of people that you can deliver
69:39 - this to them right
69:40 - and they will give you a feedback and
69:42 - then you can improve the software and
69:44 - maybe go abroad with it that's a perfect
69:46 - approach for this
69:48 - so tell me jake i want to ask you this
69:49 - one question okay
69:51 - what excites you my friend like what
69:52 - excites you about what you're doing
69:56 - what excites me what i'm doing i mean
69:58 - overall that we can
69:59 - really have impact in the world that we
70:02 - can really
70:03 - like help other people and solve their
70:05 - problems like i think by the end of the
70:06 - day
70:07 - seeing how our clients are happy is the
70:09 - best like it's
70:10 - it's just it's yeah it's totally what i
70:13 - really love so
70:14 - when i was just a developer with a team
70:15 - like of course like boss boss could say
70:17 - that yeah great job of course that was
70:19 - really nice but now when i really see
70:21 - that we
70:22 - can save or earn people earn
70:25 - money for our clients it's just the best
70:27 - thing in the world or also that
70:29 - we are building our internal team and
70:32 - the collaboration with us is great
70:34 - that we can pace uh and actually provide
70:38 - jobs to other people man it is crazy and
70:41 - also like building the brand
70:43 - uh i mean it was always my dream
70:45 - starting from personal brand now to more
70:47 - like a
70:48 - broad brand it's another factor which
70:51 - just
70:52 - drives me on daily basis i think the
70:54 - most
70:55 - so that's awesome what do you think what
70:58 - kind of mindset do you think need to
71:00 - have
71:00 - in order to be able to build something
71:02 - like this like what might
71:04 - you to have when you go into like a
71:06 - software you see or you go into
71:07 - freelancing
71:08 - what do you think um yeah so i mean
71:12 - from like my mindset i think that
71:16 - in the end i'm not scared of failing at
71:18 - all i actually
71:19 - love to learn from my own uh mistakes
71:22 - it's it's very hard to to build this
71:25 - because it
71:26 - it it's very painful most of the time
71:29 - like
71:30 - the consult with the negotiations
71:33 - which i had to gone through like it's
71:36 - been
71:37 - really stressful like i had those days
71:39 - where i literally couldn't
71:41 - code at all there was very a lot of
71:43 - stress coming because
71:44 - those snitches they needed to be done
71:46 - but at the same time i had
71:48 - to just handle the negotiation part
71:50 - meeting part
71:51 - so it takes a lot it's hard
71:54 - uh but i don't know by the end of the
71:57 - day i
71:58 - when i zoom out and i see a like a long
72:02 - picture like a big picture
72:04 - i'm happy of my results from back right
72:07 - so you see the chart
72:09 - day by day it looks like a sinus like
72:11 - literally and there's a fail there's a
72:12 - wind there's a
72:13 - there's a win but overall the trend is
72:15 - going like this right so it's going up
72:17 - like but you just really need to think
72:19 - long long term
72:20 - yeah this is actually what gave me the
72:23 - biggest mindset and i think that gary
72:24 - vaynerchuk
72:25 - like he uh taught me this a lot because
72:28 - i was like
72:29 - reading his books listing his podcast
72:32 - and watching his content
72:33 - so i think that he taught me that yeah
72:37 - yeah he's very much about you know long
72:38 - term he's very much about
72:40 - kind of doing you know things and just
72:42 - being persistent with them right
72:45 - you know and not just trying to get the
72:47 - most out of the current situation right
72:49 - um
72:50 - it's very much about you know what just
72:52 - work at it give it some time of course
72:54 - right and so forth learn from your
72:56 - mistakes and
72:58 - because the biggest thing that people
72:59 - have is they give up right like even i
73:02 - partially i want to say i partially gave
73:04 - up i mean i didn't give up
73:06 - like because i had this i mean i still
73:08 - have the software agency right
73:10 - um but i just don't take any clients
73:12 - right now at this point right
73:13 - and nor do i want to um but the reason
73:16 - why i did this because i decided to go
73:17 - someplace else but just try to do
73:19 - something
73:19 - more more of what i love right which is
73:21 - what i'm doing right now which is
73:23 - i get to teach all the students i get to
73:25 - build courses and so forth and i get to
73:27 - be part of an amazing team
73:28 - and of course and um yeah so
73:32 - i kind of did that right but a lot of a
73:34 - lot of people they'll get into this with
73:35 - a lot of high expectations
73:37 - thinking you don't need much work and
73:38 - then and then you know
73:40 - ninety percent is extremely it's
73:43 - extremely hard
73:45 - so if you are like i don't know a
73:47 - quitter
73:48 - you just don't do it at this point it's
73:50 - not worth it uh you just need to know
73:52 - that you'll
73:53 - fail badly feel like a most of the
73:56 - days but overall if you zoom out it'll
73:58 - be nice no it's it it
74:00 - was like that like a lot a lot i had a
74:02 - lot of tough
74:03 - uh also conversation with my founder
74:06 - like we had a lot of different
74:08 - kind of views on the company we still
74:10 - have and overall it's
74:11 - all hard but yeah it excites me at the
74:14 - same time so
74:15 - that's why i'm doing it and also i think
74:17 - that will be a different opinion than
74:19 - blake had because i also
74:20 - heard the previous podcast with him like
74:23 - i know that
74:24 - when he started agency that he already
74:26 - was working somewhere and
74:28 - he could actually do both at the same
74:30 - time for me it wasn't the case
74:31 - if i do something i do it all in so
74:35 - i really need to save some money for
74:37 - those two three months
74:38 - and then quit everything and then the
74:40 - worst scenario is like i fail miserably
74:43 - i can always go back get another job so
74:46 - for me that was the case that i really
74:48 - had to decide
74:50 - be under the pressure and like literally
74:52 - have the survival mindset that
74:54 - if i won't do anything for next to three
74:56 - months i literally
74:57 - won't survive i don't need to move to
74:59 - parents or something so yeah
75:01 - that was my approach to this and i know
75:03 - that there are a lot of people who need
75:05 - to do the same
75:07 - yeah that's interesting but it's not the
75:08 - only way you can also keep your job and
75:10 - start your own
75:11 - yeah there's multiple ways to go about
75:13 - it
75:14 - um tell me this i'm very curious what is
75:17 - the hardest project that you
75:19 - had to do like what is the hardest
75:21 - project where maybe you lost money
75:23 - because you had to hire someone or
75:25 - you know it was a toughest project that
75:26 - you had to go through
75:28 - you know i've had my sheriff projects
75:30 - where literally
75:31 - it was a fixed price project so i
75:33 - thought it would take this amount of
75:34 - time it took a lot more
75:36 - i'm like holy next time no you know
75:38 - i'm losing money
75:39 - like what are some of the toughest parts
75:40 - that you that you that you did
75:43 - yeah so we had a free body experiences
75:45 - hiring
75:46 - people um it wasn't really about losing
75:49 - a lot of money
75:49 - fortunately we are lucky enough to do
75:51 - that but we also don't operate on those
75:53 - like
75:53 - super crazy prices yet right yeah like
75:55 - our biggest
75:56 - project but also over a few months has
75:59 - been like maybe 27k
76:01 - so if more projects but there are lower
76:03 - prices so there's nothing to lose that
76:05 - much and that's why
76:06 - also it's like let's say safe because me
76:09 - and my co-founder we have really good
76:10 - coders so we can always
76:11 - go and code it for ourselves but we had
76:13 - those situation that i hired someone
76:16 - and then i was asking for a fee for
76:17 - feedback and stuff like this i was
76:19 - checking and then after
76:20 - one week i was like hey we need to have
76:22 - it on monday it was like literally
76:23 - sunday morning and then the guy showed
76:26 - me that he literally has nothing i was
76:27 - like
76:28 - wow we had nothing and we had to do that
76:30 - so i literally like worked
76:32 - 24 hours straight and just build the mvp
76:35 - for the guy
76:36 - and showed up and i saved the project
76:38 - and the whole um
76:39 - relation with the client right wow so i
76:42 - had to do those sacrifices then
76:44 - actually it's the upwork thing it's also
76:46 - funny it wasn't about hiring but i hired
76:49 - a friend
76:50 - for design part because like there was a
76:52 - two-step process that we had to first
76:54 - give them designs and then code it
76:57 - so i hired the guy and then
77:00 - uh it was actually um a project with
77:03 - some people from korea i think
77:05 - and then uh they give me like kind of a
77:07 - paper
77:08 - visualization of the project of some
77:10 - dashboard and they said okay do it in a
77:11 - figma in a modern way
77:12 - so my friend is really good he's
77:15 - extremely good in figma
77:16 - he designed it in a really nice modern
77:18 - way and then um
77:20 - they had to have it ready on like
77:22 - tuesday hour morning in germany
77:24 - and i was like sending everything to
77:26 - them monday evening and then
77:27 - their ceo which i never saw again in my
77:30 - life they
77:31 - she called me and she said that this is
77:32 - completely wrong that it
77:34 - cannot be like that so i would say they
77:36 - kind of scammed me
77:38 - uh because she literally sent me a
77:40 - totally new different visions with
77:42 - different
77:43 - things and they say it needs to be ready
77:44 - for tomorrow i'm like what the i
77:47 - i just did what the guy asked me to do
77:49 - in the beginning
77:50 - here's the results and i was like okay i
77:52 - can't do that like let's
77:54 - like close this contract i won't give
77:57 - you any stars and i won't charge you for
77:59 - anything
78:00 - on upwork but please don't give me any
78:02 - bad opinion but unfortunately
78:03 - they didn't give me any bad opinion but
78:05 - unfortunately during upwork
78:06 - you have the success uh job rate right
78:09 - so
78:10 - basically it went down to like 80 or
78:13 - something so
78:14 - we weren't any more hundred percent and
78:16 - it up on upwork also that was the
78:18 - reason why we quit there because i was
78:19 - really pissed with this
78:20 - situation and in the end i had to pay my
78:23 - friend
78:23 - uh who is a designer just for my pocket
78:25 - money
78:26 - uh for that because of course he did
78:29 - what he wanted that he needed to
78:31 - do yeah that was like you think
78:34 - it's it's yeah again it's very hard and
78:36 - tough and most of the time so
78:38 - those are the situation and now the
78:40 - hardest part i think it was like this
78:42 - scraping project for uh dana that
78:45 - we delivered like it was extremely hard
78:47 - to build those scrapers that weren't the
78:49 - scrapers you see normally in the
78:51 - tutorials in the
78:52 - on youtube um they were all dynamic
78:55 - scrapers you to just handle the
78:56 - javascript
78:57 - and there was like literally millions of
78:59 - data uh
79:01 - so we built those scrapers but they were
79:03 - like very old pages and sometimes the
79:04 - javascript didn't really work
79:06 - and we had to literally go a few times
79:09 - over the whole
79:10 - like iterate over this page a few times
79:12 - we had like 40 different machines
79:14 - running on those
79:14 - pages in order to do it about it
79:18 - yeah on the gcp but even then it took
79:20 - like
79:21 - like i don't know 30 hours to even
79:23 - script whole thing
79:24 - and then i sent them the data and then
79:26 - sent they sent me data from like
79:28 - four years before and then it was less
79:30 - data right now it's like what the heck
79:32 - i'm like
79:33 -  then i run it again run it again
79:35 - and i had to create another custom
79:36 - script we just combined the data and to
79:38 - delete duplicates and we are good
79:40 - but man it was very stressful also
79:42 - because i i also didn't sleep for like
79:44 - 24 hours just like rating with the guy
79:46 - checking on those computers if they are
79:47 - still running
79:49 - so yeah but it's been fun it's been fun
79:52 - we learned a lot tough times
79:55 - tough times holy that's insane so
79:58 - i mean you guys can see right like you
80:00 - know the reason why you ask this
80:02 - question a lot of times is again
80:03 - they showcase the reality of situations
80:05 - right like this can be hard like
80:07 - i've been in situations where
80:09 - i had this client who wanted this uh
80:12 - project
80:12 - and you know literally you know fixed
80:16 - our
80:16 - fixed price project and i told him hey
80:18 - it's gonna cost you seven thousand
80:19 - dollars right
80:20 - you know for like 60 hours or something
80:22 - but you know as we're doing it he wanted
80:24 - more and more and more
80:25 - and next to you know the project is like
80:28 - 300
80:31 - that's the hours that's the case which
80:32 - happens to us yeah yeah 300 hours in and
80:35 - you
80:35 - and you cannot charge the client more i
80:38 - could not charge the client more right
80:40 - because i was willing to pretty much do
80:41 - anything to just to get a good review
80:43 - from the client
80:45 - exactly i still had to pay people
80:48 - exactly like dave the clients usually
80:51 - thinks that those things are
80:52 - included in the project but you never
80:55 - talk about
80:56 - before right so we also wanted to finish
80:58 - the project like we thought we
81:00 - literally before we end up finally
81:02 - getting paid for a project we finished
81:04 - it
81:04 - i think like eight times with more and
81:06 - more features which
81:08 - client thought they were in right so
81:10 - there were also situations like that
81:13 - but that's why you are also not putting
81:15 - all of the uh x in one bucket i would
81:17 - say when it comes to clients that's why
81:18 - we overall
81:19 - work for i think 14 different clients um
81:24 - and that's why we went and we are where
81:26 - we are right now that's awesome that's
81:28 - awesome
81:29 - so tell me how does your next five years
81:31 - look like where do you see yourself kind
81:33 - of go in the next five years tell me
81:34 - jacob
81:35 - i think five maybe it's a little bit too
81:38 - much uh definitely
81:40 - i don't want let's say in the next one
81:42 - year yeah definitely
81:43 - one year uh definitely we want to focus
81:46 - down on the one niche i don't know if it
81:47 - will be automotive finish i hope it will
81:49 - be
81:50 - with our approach right now uh i will
81:53 - not definitely double down right now on
81:55 - the whole marketing
81:56 - side and literally create like a b2b
81:58 - marketing part
81:59 - uh go back to youtube videos because in
82:01 - the by the end of the day
82:03 - actually youtube is crazy when it comes
82:05 - to getting clients like i created this
82:07 - one video for
82:08 - amazon mws which was kind of my first
82:10 - project on upwork
82:11 - i gave this solution on a youtube video
82:14 - there's no videos on the whole amazon
82:16 - nws
82:17 - i got literally like 30 or 40 potential
82:19 - emails
82:20 - for clients so i know it works and i
82:23 - have already this
82:24 - nice idea how i can approach the
82:27 - automotive niche i already have a kind
82:28 - of like i think
82:29 - 30 scrapers in 30 days for different
82:31 - marketplaces so
82:33 - man i have a lot of um ideas for it so
82:36 - that's
82:36 - definitely i think we want to grow a
82:39 - team uh
82:40 - that's definitely and at some point i
82:42 - want to
82:43 - uh i i would say not really focus on
82:45 - coding that much
82:46 - so in the whole self-made um
82:50 - let's say life's a life span there were
82:52 - some moments when in the beginning i was
82:54 - doing a lot of marketing so
82:55 - trying to get a lot of leads and i was
82:57 - coding and then at some point i was just
82:59 - jealous of my co-founder that he always
83:00 - calls he gets a really nice coding
83:02 - experience like man i want to code a lot
83:04 - right now
83:05 - and over five last months i was just
83:08 - coding like 10 day
83:09 - 10 hours a day i would say on average
83:12 - man i
83:12 - can't look at this anymore i mean i
83:15 - have this sometimes really
83:16 - i want to get back to growing actually
83:19 - um
83:20 - a company doing a marketing getting on a
83:22 - client's calls
83:23 - uh meetings uh growing the team but also
83:26 - at the same time also
83:28 - like coding because i just love it right
83:30 - but it was at those
83:31 - stages so yeah yeah that's for sure
83:35 - i think it's so funny because i when i
83:37 - was when you were working with us
83:39 - i remember from you as well you're like
83:40 - man i just can't wait to code again i
83:42 - miss cutting so much you know
83:44 - all the time i hear from you just i miss
83:46 - cody i want to code
83:47 - you know and then here you tell me like
83:49 - i couldn't like i've heard it for five
83:50 - months i'm like i'm done with
83:51 - this
83:53 - yeah yeah yeah it's like something
83:55 - that's not a thing that
83:57 - i think that's why i think i might be a
83:58 - good fit to this that i could be let's
84:00 - say a ceo because i know a little a lot
84:02 - about coding so i know how to talk about
84:04 - the
84:04 - technique technical part but i also am
84:07 - very interested in the business side so
84:10 - that's why i really like this part
84:12 - that's awesome some somebody here asked
84:14 - a really good question
84:15 - amg asked what mindset are you looking
84:17 - for when hiring so like when you when
84:18 - you hire
84:19 - developers on upwork or whatever else
84:20 - might be do you look for specifically
84:22 - something or no
84:23 - tell me um so yeah with hiring you are
84:27 - very
84:28 - um career like i would say it's a very
84:30 - slow
84:31 - process for us uh and because we failed
84:34 - so many times right now we are
84:36 - mostly hiring my recommendations and
84:39 - that's
84:39 - part one and also when it comes to
84:42 - mindset
84:43 - i really want those guys to be part of
84:46 - our team
84:47 - so even though right now we can't afford
84:48 - like a full-time yet
84:50 - developers right we want to um
84:53 - hire them for those contracts that that
84:56 - one day
84:57 - they will work with us full-time so
85:00 - that's mostly the mindset that they want
85:02 - to work with the industry
85:03 - they're willing to learn new things uh
85:05 - because at some point
85:07 - i would love uh to build a lot of uh
85:10 - content around the
85:11 - company agency like podcasts videos and
85:13 - stuff like this so
85:15 - if they will also be interested in this
85:16 - thing that would be perfect i don't want
85:17 - to force anyone to do it that's
85:19 - perfectly fine right
85:20 - but if they are also willing to do those
85:21 - things man that's like a
85:24 - dream so wait wait wait wait you're
85:26 - saying you want to build up do a podcast
85:28 - or build a podcast what are you talking
85:29 - about you know like overall when it
85:30 - comes to like marketing part of our
85:32 - company
85:33 - i would love to like create a podcast
85:35 - more youtube content
85:36 - instagram content and so on so if our
85:39 - employees
85:40 - if they would love to show up on those
85:41 - things that i would be the happiest guy
85:43 - in the world so
85:44 - yeah i mean they would really believe in
85:46 - their brand
85:47 - right so they are really part of the
85:49 - brand of this family
85:50 - i would love that brand is so powerful
85:54 - brand is literally everything honestly
85:55 - like jacob like that's the one thing we
85:57 - realized here at a clever program right
85:59 - is
86:00 - like even for example we have a boot
86:02 - camp that we started here at clever
86:03 - program right it's a boot camp that you
86:05 - know that takes people you know towards
86:07 - becoming developers in early six months
86:09 - and because they've had so much brand
86:12 - over all these years
86:13 - we've been able to be been able to start
86:15 - this up really really fast and actually
86:16 - have a lot of demand for from other
86:18 - students right
86:19 - because of that um and we kind of just
86:21 - realized i'm holy because every
86:23 - time i get a call with a person who's
86:24 - who does want to join the boot camp
86:26 - they're like oh i saw this video or
86:28 - i saw you guys here i saw you guys in
86:30 - this video or in this video on this
86:31 - video right
86:32 - or saw you guys on instagram or even a
86:34 - tick tock right and like oh this is so
86:36 - cool
86:37 - like it's crazy how much how much brand
86:40 - has so much
86:41 - pop not power but like there's so much
86:43 - value right
86:44 - you know it's like what kind of like
86:46 - what um garyvee
86:48 - gary always says you know jab jab jab
86:51 - right hook right
86:52 - so jab jab jab give val give out give
86:54 - back and ask
86:55 - right very quickly right very and then
86:57 - not very quickly but then ask after that
86:59 - right and realize that that's such a
87:02 - like keeping that in check is so
87:04 - important keep it then in check and not
87:06 - always
87:07 - asking is such an important ask it's not
87:09 - such an important aspect
87:11 - and instead just always kind of trying
87:12 - to give value put yourself
87:14 - out there right because what you're
87:16 - creating is you create a family like
87:18 - that
87:18 - believes in you you know what i mean
87:21 - that believes in you
87:22 - exactly that's also there's a
87:25 - concept of like let's say um salary
87:29 - uh personally i would feel bad if i have
87:31 - just fixed salary especially in those
87:33 - early stages so
87:34 - whoever joins join us right now like he
87:37 - has
87:38 - a huge impact what are we in the future
87:41 - and i wouldn't just stop on like this
87:43 - fixed salary
87:44 - i would literally go to the bonuses and
87:46 - so on because like
87:47 - if the guy trusts us right now believes
87:49 - in us and he's a part of the team right
87:51 - now then
87:52 - if we grow into like multi-million
87:53 - dollar company right
87:55 - like i would have no problem to sharing
87:57 - devs with those people
87:58 - because they were there first they
88:00 - believed in us so i would feel really
88:02 - bad
88:02 - just paying fixed um yeah do you want to
88:05 - get to the multi-million dollar agency
88:08 - i think it's i mean we'll be there at
88:11 - some point
88:12 - i just don't know when uh but this will
88:15 - happen
88:16 - i mean if we keep up what we do that's
88:18 - what i believe
88:19 - uh the long term game and that's why i
88:22 - don't want to quit at all
88:23 - it's that if you really do it like
88:25 - especially okay right now in the
88:27 - automotive industry what we see is like
88:28 - there's a huge barrier it's extremely
88:31 - hard to get in
88:32 - like there are those people who are
88:33 - building this software there are those
88:34 - companies who are getting this offer
88:35 - from them
88:36 - so it's literally those are close man
88:38 - but if they will be open just a little
88:40 - we get in man and we are there um
88:43 - that's what i believe so at some point
88:45 - of course uh
88:46 - i think i mean i know we will get there
88:49 - it will be very tough it will be very
88:50 - hard yeah
88:51 - harder than ever but i'm excited for it
88:54 - because
88:54 - also why i'm in this is that this is
88:57 - like you cannot predict what will happen
88:59 - even you won't there are some patterns
89:01 - you don't know who you will meet
89:04 - um that's why i'm also excited so you
89:06 - never know and i just and i kind of
89:07 - remember you remember you kind of when
89:09 - you first kind of left
89:10 - uh clever programmer right and you want
89:12 - to start your short separate agency like
89:14 - you were such a more of a beginner on
89:17 - the aspect of like a software agency
89:18 - right or like a business type aspect
89:20 - right
89:21 - and now like a few months later like
89:23 - you're you're this grown-up guy
89:25 - i'm not saying i mean you you were grown
89:27 - up before as well right but
89:29 - like more growing up in the knowledge
89:31 - base and
89:32 - and in your focus probably in terms of
89:34 - what you want to do a 22 year old right
89:36 - it's still pretty crazy
89:38 - you want to build your own software
89:39 - agency you got clients at 22 years old
89:41 - i don't know what i was doing 22 year
89:43 - olds but i was not building software
89:44 - ages that's for sure
89:47 - you know granted i was still working
89:49 - hard of course right that was still me
89:50 - always
89:52 - always but i wasn't doing that so
89:55 - from my point of view you know you're
89:56 - doing you're doing an amazing job and
89:59 - you know i'm really excited for where
90:00 - you're gonna go kind of the next few
90:01 - years
90:02 - you know i'm really excited appreciate
90:04 - it we
90:05 - this other pot this podcast in the next
90:08 - year or so again
90:10 - and we're going to call it man i'm
90:12 - housing for it
90:14 - it's going to be a million dollars now
90:16 - at that point
90:17 - seven figures one figure mode but man
90:19 - what's funny is like when you do
90:21 - this uh when you let's say go back and
90:25 - you look
90:25 - at yourself for example one a year ago
90:28 - two years ago and man
90:29 - every time i do this i i'm like what a
90:32 - jerk
90:33 - like who the i thought i am man so
90:36 - literally
90:36 - future myself are you watching this i'm
90:39 - sorry
90:42 - but man i'm excited so yeah i mean look
90:45 - you know it's the best part when you get
90:46 - to grow like even for example for me
90:48 - you know i get to look at myself you
90:50 - know when i've done i
90:52 - i watched recently the the the first
90:55 - video i did for clever programmer right
90:57 - i was like this innocent guy i was like
90:58 - hey guys you know how are you guys doing
91:00 - hope homeball is great
91:02 - you know you know and i just like i'm
91:04 - like i'm looking myself i'm like holy
91:06 -  who is this guy
91:07 - you know and i remember the first time
91:09 - that they kazzy and
91:11 - the team they took me out to what's it
91:13 - called to um
91:15 - santa monica here and they put me on the
91:17 - spot and just said hey
91:18 - we'll film you it's called the the video
91:20 - is called seven years and seven minutes
91:22 - and i remember that was so yeah i saw it
91:25 - i was so scared i was my pants
91:27 - like you know i was so scared to be
91:30 - talking in front of so many people but
91:31 - now
91:32 - i get to do this every day now if i go
91:34 - to santa monica and i have to shoot a
91:35 - video it's like a piece of cake i'm like
91:37 - let's roll you know i'm gonna tell you
91:39 - even the video you
91:40 - recorded the seven years in seven
91:42 - minutes i watched that and at this point
91:44 - i was
91:44 - literally watching it and back in poland
91:46 - because i discovered a clever programmer
91:48 - like literally like i know three years
91:50 - ago i was watching kazzyman then i saw
91:52 - you as like
91:52 - man those those guys are so cool they
91:55 - know so much i wanna work with them one
91:57 - day
91:58 - and then i grew the instagram at some
92:00 - point i texted qazi man it just happened
92:02 - right it just happened you think about
92:03 - it every single day
92:04 - and you really want it but i believe
92:06 - that it will happen
92:07 - but you really need to work on that you
92:10 - just need to work on it you
92:12 - just need to work on it those of you who
92:13 - think you know i tell
92:15 - i tell this to a lot of students because
92:16 - i get to speak to a lot of students now
92:18 - at this point right
92:19 - it's very simple is that there's two
92:21 - types of people in this world there's
92:22 - the types of people who talk about what
92:23 - they want to be
92:24 - they talk about the goals i want to do
92:26 - this i want to do this i want to do that
92:29 - but they do nothing about it because you
92:32 - know how the human brain works it's like
92:34 - whenever you talk about something
92:35 - your brain feels like you're like you
92:37 - already feel good your brain kind of
92:39 - feels like you already
92:40 - accomplished that so you don't do
92:41 - anything about that so i really usually
92:43 - i don't even talk about stuff that's why
92:44 - i'm not also like on
92:45 - instagram anymore because it's like i
92:47 - really focus on the work right now
92:49 - we really focus on taking the action not
92:52 - really sharing about that
92:53 - that it's totally different when i was
92:55 - sharing a lot of stuff on instagram
92:57 - at some point i was literally automating
92:58 - this that i was resharing the same post
93:00 - i just felt good
93:01 - i felt productive but it was like all
93:03 - fake productivity it was
93:05 - it wasn't bringing any results in the
93:07 - end so also be careful
93:09 - when talking but also i hate myself when
93:11 - i talk about something
93:13 - and i won't do it that's another thing
93:14 - right i talk about something then people
93:16 - are telling me about
93:17 - something like what i said and i just
93:19 - need to do it so
93:20 - it can works in different ways depends
93:23 - on your personality again
93:25 - it's so funny for the for day he's like
93:27 - how do i join the team like domain is
93:28 - mechanic and software dev
93:30 - what's too much to enjoy trying to join
93:32 - the self-made team we're trying to join
93:33 - the clever programmer team
93:39 - but yeah for those of you guys who do
93:41 - who are interested for example
93:42 - and you know getting your career started
93:44 - as a software developer just want to let
93:46 - you know guys
93:47 - down in the comments below we have just
93:49 - text hashtag coaching to the number you
93:51 - see below in the description on

93:55 - know we're doing
93:56 - you know uh free coaching to students
93:58 - who are interested right

94:02 - minute coaching session just to figure
94:03 - out you know
94:04 - you know what you want to do and so
94:05 - forth for days as the agency
94:07 - if you want to join the agency you talk
94:08 - to jacob
94:10 - [Laughter]
94:12 - exactly now i can only i can only agree
94:14 - like being a part of a clever programmer
94:16 - team also changed my game
94:18 - like i learned how to talk to people
94:20 - those coaching calls with like 40
94:22 - 50 students man it's been crazy it's
94:26 - been crazy like i'm not scared of
94:27 - talking to people at all after that
