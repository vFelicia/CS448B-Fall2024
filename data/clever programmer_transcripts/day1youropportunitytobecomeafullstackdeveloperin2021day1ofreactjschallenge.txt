04:47 - are right here and this is according to
04:49 - ziprecruiter you can type in react.js
04:51 - and go take a look at this
04:53 - so tell me what it would be like if you
04:56 - were able to make this type of income
04:58 - even if this might not be your goal what
05:01 - would you be able to do if you were
05:02 - making a higher income as a developer if
05:04 - you were making i don't know like if you
05:06 - were making fifty thousand or seventy
05:07 - thousand or 126 thousand 000
05:09 - a year what would that allow you to do
05:11 - what would you do with that money that
05:13 - you
05:13 - get okay i don't want to hear i'm just
05:15 - going to stash and keep it all for
05:17 - myself
05:18 - that's great but would you actually take
05:20 - that money and make an impact either in
05:22 - your life or somebody else's life i want
05:24 - to see it
05:25 - what would that look like
05:29 - okay let's see we have people saying
05:32 - okay the camera is blurry
05:34 - could somebody please sit down next to
05:36 - the camera and just keep making sure
05:37 - it's
05:38 - good okay

05:44 - james says go live in dubai fantastic
05:48 - okay so it's not just because of the
05:49 - white screen but you can actually change
05:51 - the polarizer
05:52 - a little bit and that should be a little
05:53 - bit better
05:55 - pay off my parents house
05:59 - okay great
06:05 - okay uh nas can you actually help me
06:07 - with this bro no
06:08 - if you could help me with this the

06:46 - brandon says invest in tesla matthews
06:49 - jose says travel to all
06:51 - countries in the world
06:55 - wow that is amazing
07:01 - travel maryland says travel real estate
07:04 - invest
07:04 - grow my business okay so basically
07:06 - maryland what it looks like is you want
07:08 - to learn the skill of coding
07:09 - so then you can take that income save
07:11 - that up and then start investing it into
07:13 - real estate so you can start developing
07:15 - passive income
07:16 - does that sound about right let me know
07:17 - in the comments
07:19 - abdul says is this salary achievable
07:22 - through
07:22 - remote job and here's the truth
07:29 - a little bit like this so we can also
07:30 - see the screen here is the truth right
07:33 - is the salary achievable
07:34 - so the answer is that yes this salary is
07:37 - achievable through a remote job and
07:39 - because of the pandemic
07:40 - most jobs are now remote jobs right
07:44 - so it doesn't matter where you are in
07:46 - the world most people are able to land
07:47 - jobs in the u.s market in the europe
07:50 - market
07:50 - it's totally doable so those salaries
07:53 - are achievable and a lot of people are
07:55 - working full-time jobs remotely
07:59 - okay maryland says yep along with
08:03 - helping out with my other industry
08:04 - fields that i work in
08:05 - great muhammad says learning to get a
08:07 - job and help my family
08:09 - okay my dream remote job that's
08:11 - natalia's dream
08:12 - so here's the thing right i'm happy that
08:15 - this is your guys's dreams i'm happy
08:17 - that
08:18 - you guys are learning these things and
08:19 - you're excited about it but what i want
08:21 - to do my job here
08:22 - is to make sure not only you're
08:25 - motivated but you
08:26 - actually put in the work to actually get
08:28 - these goals right because
08:29 - natalia we spoke with you yesterday on
08:31 - the phone you invested in lambda school
08:33 - but like you still were not able to get
08:36 - a job
08:37 - right and what they did is
08:40 - they helped you learn skills but they
08:43 - haven't done their
08:44 - job in terms of taking you all the way
08:47 - through
08:48 - to getting you a job okay so what i want
08:51 - you to be able to do natalia for example
08:53 - is keep putting in massive amount of
08:55 - effort and time and skills
08:57 - like hours okay actually like 20 to 40
08:59 - hours a week if not more
09:02 - into coding and aggressively increasing
09:04 - that skill set because
09:06 - what happens a lot now is people bring
09:08 - you in recruiters bring you in for a job
09:11 - interview
09:11 - because they see a nice portfolio
09:13 - because you might have seen
09:15 - my clone or somebody else building a
09:17 - clone or a project right
09:19 - and you might put it on your resume so
09:21 - as a recruiter i'll bring you in
09:23 - but when i bring you in and i ask you
09:25 - questions about algorithms and i ask you
09:27 - hey could you
09:27 - make a google search engine from scratch
09:30 - or could you
09:31 - write recursive fibonacci sequence and
09:33 - you
09:34 - can't answer those questions and you
09:37 - crumble under pressure
09:39 - you're never getting that job there's no
09:42 - way
09:42 - most people will laugh you out of the
09:44 - room most recruiters would
09:47 - so it's a combination of having amazing
09:50 - projects
09:51 - along with amazing technical
09:53 - interviewing skills
09:55 - is it fair like do you need to know
09:57 - those things for everyday
09:58 - job no you don't but
10:01 - did they still test you on that and do
10:04 - this still hire people based off those
10:06 - skills yes they do
10:08 - so you could choose to opt out and be
10:10 - like hey i'm not playing that game
10:11 - and just not work at those big companies
10:13 - big tech companies
10:14 - or you could be like you know what i'll
10:16 - learn and just beat them at their
10:18 - own game become a master of not only
10:20 - front-end skills but also algorithm
10:22 - skills and data structure skills
10:24 - does that make sense so really i want
10:26 - you guys to lock in those skills for
10:28 - yourself
10:29 - okay fantastic
10:33 - 406 people live man that's what i'm
10:34 - talking about usher says
10:36 - 470 let it let's go
10:39 - that's fantastic okay
10:44 - natalia says i want to beat them let's
10:46 - go hey if you want natalia to
10:48 - beat the recruiters and get a job smash
10:52 - that like button

19:27 - month long game
19:28 - if in your mind you're playing anything
19:30 - that's less than a six to ten month game

19:34 - going to take less than that time
19:36 - if it does great has it happened for
19:38 - people absolutely
19:40 - but i want you to mentally be prepared
19:42 - for this
19:43 - all right six to ten month is the name
19:45 - of the game
19:47 - for your coding skills i want you to be
19:49 - thinking about putting in 40 to 20 to 40
19:51 - hours per week to learn and master these
19:54 - skills
19:54 - these are the things that are just
19:56 - required for you to
19:58 - succeed if you're unable to do these
20:00 - you're going to have a tremendously hard
20:01 - time and your timeline is going to look
20:03 - like a couple of years
20:04 - rather than 6 to ten months okay
20:07 - so this is an important thing for you to
20:09 - understand all right

36:13 - the simplest thing the same thing that
36:15 - is true for learning wrestling jiu jitsu
36:17 - or dancing or biking
36:19 - it's hours on the bike it's hours on the
36:21 - mat it's
36:22 - hours on the freaking keyboard if you're
36:24 - a developer it's hours
36:27 - not only on the keyboard but also hours
36:30 - here in your brain okay so
36:32 - you type your code here but you problem
36:34 - solve here
36:35 - how many hours are you spending in here
36:37 - problem solving
36:38 - what my time looks like oftentimes when
36:40 - i'm coding is i'll code for a couple of
36:42 - hours and then i'm going for a walk
36:44 - and i'm thinking about that problem and
36:46 - solving it while i'm taking a shower
36:48 - while i'm going to bed while i'm walking
36:50 - around i'm spending
36:53 - 10 to 20 hours a day okay and
36:56 - definitely when i was trying to get a
36:57 - job in those days i was actually coding
36:59 - for 10 to 20 hours
37:00 - every [ __ ] day okay so if you really
37:03 - want to get those skills
37:05 - jacked up then it's not magic people
37:08 - think it's magic what we do
37:10 - it's not magic we take the amount of
37:12 - work that people would normally do in
37:14 - four years
37:15 - we make them do that in six months
37:19 - whether we have to [ __ ] yell at the
37:20 - people that are in their brother like
37:22 - you have to work no you got to show up
37:24 - or whether we have to do it with love
37:26 - and care and get you to come in and do
37:28 - it
37:28 - we will get you to put in 20 to 40 hours
37:31 - a week or more and you have to get
37:33 - yourself to be able to do that
37:34 - okay and you take the amount of hours
37:37 - normal people put in four years you put
37:39 - it in 10 months
37:40 - all right that's what i want for you
37:43 - clever programmer team is magical
37:45 - adrienne says that is amazing
37:47 - uh iu design asks what's my background
37:49 - music yeah what is it
37:51 - damn i don't know i actually don't know
37:53 - the name of it okay
37:55 - uh it's on epidemic sounds that's where
37:57 - i'm getting it from it's cheap
37:59 - if debbie sounds cheap i'm cheap so it
38:02 - works
38:03 - works perfectly we have already made
38:05 - amazon why again will it be different in
38:07 - some parts
38:08 - okay so that's a great question we have
38:10 - made amazon clone multiple times on this
38:12 - channel we're gonna do it again
38:15 - the number one thing that's important to
38:17 - understand
38:18 - is the whole point of the challenge is
38:19 - that you built it
38:22 - it's not so you can watch us build it
38:24 - it's so you build it
38:25 - so everybody's in the challenge
38:26 - generally they're much more engaged than
38:28 - normal people are just sitting around
38:29 - watching videos on youtube because
38:30 - they're just watching from their
38:32 - phone they're like going around the
38:34 - point of the challenge is that you
38:35 - become a part of this and you build it
38:37 - alongside us and you leave
38:38 - with your amazon project on your
38:41 - portfolio so that you can go and get a
38:42 - job does that make sense
38:44 - okay so we build it again maybe you'll
38:47 - pick up new things this time
38:48 - we might use different technologies
38:50 - times who knows we might use styled
38:52 - components or we might add in
38:54 - you know um context api or redux we
38:57 - might have something new
38:58 - okay you'll just have to come and see
39:00 - but the whole point is
39:01 - that you do it that's the point of the
39:03 - challenge not so you
39:05 - watch it you do it okay
39:08 - habiba says take my name cause it will
39:10 - influence me okay there you go your
39:12 - influence now
39:15 - um okay god and whoa aditya says got a
39:18 - 120k offered this month
39:21 - thanks a lot qazi yo that's what i'm
39:23 - talking about baby
39:31 - oh perfect thank you bro that's clutch
39:34 - let's get that going all right joe blow
39:38 - asks what does pwg complement the boot
39:41 - camp or are they completely different do
39:43 - you recommend someone in your pwj doing
39:44 - the boot camp
39:46 - so the answer is very simple okay
39:51 - boot camp is way more advanced and
39:54 - hands-on than even pwg
39:56 - is as much as we love pwj if you join
39:59 - the bootcamp
40:00 - you don't need to take pwg it could be
40:03 - there to supplement it and
40:04 - complement it but it's not necessary
40:06 - okay the bootcamp is completely
40:08 - self-inclusive
40:10 - and they're just way crazier hands-on
40:13 - training that's happening in the boot
40:14 - camp and the number one goal of the
40:16 - bootcamp is
40:17 - we literally work with you until
40:21 - you are placed at a job that's it
40:24 - okay and a lot of our students actually
40:29 - are from profit with javascript how many
40:32 - 80 80 of our students actually in the
40:34 - boot camp are from profit with
40:35 - javascript so
40:37 - yeah a lot of them are joining it so
40:40 - yeah you could look into it for sure
40:42 - but we'll talk about that on the last
40:44 - day okay the day five
40:48 - milos amazing amazing okay i'm stuck at
40:51 - redux please help
40:52 - okay so with redux right coding phoenix
40:58 - redux is a confusing thing to understand
41:01 - and grasp and put your mind around it's
41:03 - very confusing
41:04 - okay so i'll like i'll bring up the icon
41:08 - see if i can bring up the icon and show
41:10 - you guys okay
41:13 - initializing database holy crap
41:18 - all right so that's redux and that's
41:21 - what it looks like okay
41:24 - um do you have a better image of it
41:28 - save
41:31 - downloads yes save right there
41:34 - okay let's see if i can bring it up
41:38 - there we go okay very wonky way of
41:42 - getting this but
41:43 - oh we got a super chat let's go thank
41:45 - you guys for the donations always
41:46 - appreciate them
41:48 - thank you so much appreciate it just
41:50 - shows me that you guys love us okay
41:53 - um so you know i wish my mom showed me
41:56 - she loves me like this too i'd be really
41:57 - rich
41:58 - but here's redux and redux is a state
42:01 - management tool
42:03 - okay if you are using postmates or if
42:06 - you have used ubereats
42:07 - or if you have used right
42:10 - and you see that like cart items at the
42:13 - top and
42:14 - and you do a checkout and it says two
42:16 - items in cart
42:17 - and then you go back and you add in a
42:20 - new item and now it says three items
42:21 - for it to be able to do that without
42:23 - refreshing without losing that data
42:26 - if you get out of the app and you come
42:27 - back and it's still there
42:29 - that's an example of redux that's state
42:31 - management
42:33 - your app state is being managed through
42:35 - a technology called the redux okay and
42:37 - if you can understand how redux works
42:41 - you are looking to add a 10 to 20 000 a
42:44 - year boost in your salary if you deeply
42:46 - understand how redux works
42:47 - but redux takes a while to grasp your
42:50 - mind around
42:51 - so it's right something like state
42:55 - management like this
42:56 - takes some time companies that use it
42:59 - are corporations that are often times
43:01 - mid-sized
43:02 - to large-sized corporations okay if we
43:05 - can just mute that guys that'd be great
43:07 - so mid-size to large-size corporations
43:10 - use redux
43:11 - okay so a lot of it's just being used
43:14 - extensively if i take you to
43:16 - uh there's something called npm trends
43:18 - by the way which is fantastic resource
43:22 - so let me take you here right and here
43:24 - if you type in like react.js
43:26 - super popular and you'll see how many
43:28 - times react.js is being downloaded right
43:31 - is it showing me react.js or what is it
43:32 - showing me it's index
43:34 - weird all right so let's just type in
43:36 - react
43:38 - whoops all right and now you can see how
43:41 - many times react is being downloaded
43:43 - which is about
43:45 - oops which is about
43:49 - eight million times per
43:52 - uh per whatever per day or yeah like
43:55 - it's crazy number right 10 million
43:57 - downloads on february 28th
44:00 - march 7th so actually it's giving me a
44:02 - weekly number is what it seems like
44:04 - okay and every week we have 10 million
44:07 - downloads 10 million downloads
44:09 - here we had four million downloads
44:10 - because i think for new year's people
44:12 - were out partying developers
44:14 - apparently developers were out partying
44:15 - what the hell's going on here
44:17 - and now it seems like q2 is about to
44:19 - kick in and everybody's going
44:21 - ham right if you look at
44:24 - redux and if i add that in here like
44:26 - i'll add in something like material ui
44:28 - okay which is another one of um
44:30 - something really popular but like look
44:32 - material ui is like down here almost
44:34 - invisible
44:35 - super popular right but it's like
44:37 - invisible compared to react 133 download
44:39 - 1 000 downloads per week but now watch
44:41 - what happens when i add in redux look at
44:43 - this
44:45 - look at that boom redux is seeing about
44:50 - five million downloads per week
44:53 - okay so it is massive
44:57 - massive okay it's a really really
44:59 - popular technology
45:01 - so i recommend that people learn this
45:03 - but if you want to learn this make sure
45:05 - you're learning javascript
45:06 - really well first and make sure you are
45:09 - learning
45:10 - uh react really well first and then
45:14 - slowly ease your way into it and before
45:16 - you learn redux
45:17 - learn something like context api and
45:20 - then
45:20 - go all the way to redux okay so in like
45:22 - a four-step process
45:24 - all right so we go javascript
45:28 - we go react oh [ __ ]
45:32 - there we go um we go
45:37 - context api and then we go
45:41 - redux hey
45:44 - thank you new donation vanessa i
45:46 - appreciate you so much thank you
45:50 - so i hope that this makes sense for you
45:52 - guys okay
45:54 - all right we got a photo
45:59 - okay let's see this photo here
46:03 - uh lexi crawford says what if we are in
46:06 - a boot camp already
46:07 - what do you recommend i really want to
46:10 - work with you all
46:11 - that's a fantastic question lexi that is
46:14 - amazing
46:15 - definitely if you want you can uh book a
46:18 - call with us and we can talk to you and
46:19 - we can figure something out
46:20 - but essentially what that looks like
46:22 - it's not a problem at all most of our
46:23 - students have
46:24 - are either have gone to a boot camp
46:26 - previously
46:28 - you know universities or some students
46:30 - were in boot camps or in universities
46:32 - and then decided to
46:33 - join our program if we speak with you
46:37 - it would be very simple but just figure
46:39 - out what's the best solution for you if
46:40 - it's you stay in your current boot camp
46:42 - you can choose to do that
46:43 - or if it's this sounds like a good
46:45 - option we can talk to you about that
46:46 - okay
46:47 - so if you're interested by the way what
46:49 - you can do is
46:50 - um i'll put up a number
46:54 - for you okay and
46:58 - just this is the number okay
47:05 - so you can just text me here all right
47:07 - you can text me here this is my phone
47:09 - number
47:10 - and you can say bootcamp
47:14 - and then i can just chat with you from
47:15 - there okay so just text me that
47:18 - if you're interested and you want to
47:19 - talk about it lexi text me bootcamp and
47:21 - then we'll go from there
47:23 - okay hope that makes sense if any of you
47:25 - guys are interested too
47:26 - you can do the same thing that's all
47:28 - good all right
47:30 - beautiful moving on great questions guys
47:33 - fantastic questions
47:34 - all right man the setup is so
47:38 - dope it's so cool i love it all right
47:41 - going back all right
47:45 - let me open this all right so
47:49 - sampada says what's the agenda for today
47:50 - the agenda for today is very simple it's

47:54 - a developer which i did in the start
47:56 - okay how much salary does the developer
47:58 - make let me ask you guys what's the
47:59 - average
48:00 - salary of a developer in us okay drop

48:35 - need by the way for tomorrow
48:37 - it's not necessary but it is helpful if
48:39 - you guys get these
48:40 - uh figured out so make sure that you
48:43 - have uh via something like vs code
48:46 - uh installed oh my goodness yeah that's
48:49 - perfect installed on your computer
48:51 - okay right uh see if you can get node.js
48:55 - installed
48:58 - uh react no that's fine

53:25 - uh this challenge yes it will be
53:27 - definitely watchable later for sure
53:29 - okay
53:33 - yes great question uh reshadow says
53:37 - quasi
53:38 - react or view or django and why i think
53:41 - they're all
53:42 - fantastic
53:45 - but you have to think about why you're
53:46 - learning them if you're in the python
53:48 - world
53:48 - i think it makes ton of sense to learn
53:50 - django
53:51 - right if you're in the javascript world
53:53 - i think it makes a ton of sense to
53:55 - learn react okay so i like vue as well
53:59 - but i think
54:00 - react is the way to go and it's one of
54:02 - the most popular
54:03 - and i like it way better than view okay
54:06 - so
54:06 - go with react and look even if you're
54:09 - doing python or something else
54:10 - you can just whip up an api and still
54:14 - use javascript and react and then have
54:16 - python slash django for your back end
54:18 - so if you wanna go hard on front end and
54:21 - become good
54:22 - i would say like learn learn react
54:25 - learn and learn it well i sent you a
54:28 - message
54:31 - is your wardrobe full of soccer kids yes
54:33 - i love soccer bro
54:44 - if i want to join the program boot camp
54:47 - what are the prerequisites so
54:49 - uh for the boot camp couple of
54:51 - prerequisites
54:52 - are you need a computer
54:56 - you need internet you need
54:59 - to um you need to be able to
55:03 - put in at least 20 to 40 hours per week
55:06 - minimum if you can't do that don't join
55:08 - our programs
55:13 - you need to be excited about coding okay
55:15 - and you need to understand that things
55:16 - take six to ten months okay
55:18 - those are a couple of really important
55:20 - things to understand okay
55:21 - uh there is a financial investment to be
55:23 - able to join the boot camp
55:26 - somebody just did a 20 donation let's
55:33 - on go he said that
55:37 - let's go that is amazing on
55:40 - thank you for the 20 donation
55:44 - and he goes clever programmer is the
55:45 - best on is the guy we're talking about
55:47 - guys who landed a job as a developer so
55:49 - that
55:50 - is freaking fantastic that is so
