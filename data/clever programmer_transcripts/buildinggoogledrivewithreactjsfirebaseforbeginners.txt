01:43 - grab the attention of everybody
01:45 - what's up you guys it's david here from
01:47 - coverprogrammer.com and today
01:49 - we are going to be building the google
01:52 - drive clone
01:53 - so i just want you guys to take a quick
01:56 - look at what's gonna
01:57 - what we are gonna be building right here
02:00 - right now and this is actually
02:02 - the working google drive once again this
02:05 - is something that
02:06 - you guys asked in a uh
02:09 - form which is by the way down below in
02:12 - the description you
02:13 - so you guys nope this is a 100
02:16 - live black ops 2 20 000
02:20 - i think yeah so yep this is 100
02:23 - live um
02:26 - and this is act this stream is actually
02:29 - something that you guys asked
02:31 - i got a message uh by one of you
02:34 - and so that's why i created this so
02:37 - today we are actually going to be
02:39 - building this very google drive that you
02:42 - can see here
02:43 - using react.js and firebase so
02:46 - we can actually like we could actually
02:48 - say that normally
02:50 - for a free google uh account you get
02:53 - 15 gigs of storage now you as a
02:56 - developer you can pretty much
02:58 - create a new one which is going to be
03:01 - add
03:02 - adding an additional five gigabytes okay
03:05 - so
03:05 - that's that's an unfair advantage for
03:08 - developers but whatever
03:10 - okay uh okay so i got this question
03:14 - should i code along yes please code
03:17 - along
03:18 - that's the uh that's the most but in
03:20 - case
03:21 - um because i'll be going a bit fast but
03:24 - in case
03:24 - uh you you can't
03:27 - uh can stay like
03:31 - you're not fast enough how do you say
03:33 - that
03:34 - um whatever i'll be dropping down a
03:38 - github link down below in the
03:39 - description
03:40 - once i finish this live i'll just push
03:42 - it to github and you guys can go ahead
03:44 - clone it and then just play around with
03:46 - it
03:46 - um what's up florida i'm gonna watch it
03:49 - when you're done
03:50 - okay sounds good all right with that
03:53 - said
03:54 - let's get straight into it so what i
03:56 - actually went ahead and done
03:58 - already is in this terminal
04:02 - uh i've already done the npx create
04:04 - react app
04:05 - uh part of things i missed a dash over
04:08 - there but that's not a problem
04:10 - so uh i've already done that and because
04:12 - i'm using yarn i
04:13 - am super fast with this so i highly
04:15 - highly recommend everybody goes ahead
04:17 - and installs yarn and by the way
04:20 - just uh quickly a massive massive shout
04:23 - out to amano
04:24 - we are actually on a call and he's going
04:27 - to shout in
04:28 - if uh something's up with the stream
04:32 - so yes and yeah exactly
04:35 - just how pronounced says npx create
04:37 - react app google drive clone
04:39 - that's it and while we are actually
04:42 - there
04:43 - uh it's actually a good idea to go to
04:46 - firebase
04:47 - right away and let's just get
04:50 - get that set up uh in the meantime okay
04:54 - so now it is time to follow me
04:58 - if i'm a bit too fast not a problem this
05:01 - is recorded this is going to be once
05:03 - again
05:04 - massive shout out to kyle our amazing
05:06 - editor
05:07 - uh he's going to chop this up and
05:10 - we'll make a shorter version of this
05:12 - vera video so you guys can go ahead and
05:14 - just
05:15 - quickly run through the whole thing so
05:17 - with that said
05:18 - um i'm gonna go go into
05:21 - my firebase console create a
05:24 - brand new project which i will call uh
05:28 - google drive clone live
05:32 - i don't need google analytics so i will
05:34 - be turning that
05:35 - off and yes we are going to be using
05:38 - database and
05:39 - oh the auth egypt says hello
05:42 - what's up egypt how's it going
05:47 - and yep so it's finishing up we got the
05:51 - project
05:52 - up and running and okay we got 120
05:55 - people live that's amazing guys
05:58 - so if you guys aren't uh pumped about
06:00 - this build because i'm sure i
06:02 - because i sure am make sure to smash
06:04 - that like button for that youtube
06:06 - algorithm and just make sure that it
06:08 - looks blue okay
06:09 - so that's something super important that
06:11 - actually helps you become a better
06:12 - developer
06:13 - i'm joking um
06:17 - all right so in here because we have
06:19 - already the project we're just gonna add
06:21 - a new application
06:22 - uh we can just call it like i don't know
06:25 - google
06:26 - drive and
06:29 - whatever you can also go ahead and set
06:31 - up firebase hosting
06:32 - in this video i'm not going to mess
06:34 - around with that um
06:37 - because i just want to get this done
06:39 - fast and
06:40 - so you guys can uh have the most value
06:42 - in the shortest time
06:44 - what's up peru and
06:47 - how much knowledge does it l uh how much
06:49 - knowledge of react does
06:51 - it require actually not a lot okay
06:54 - so don't worry about that um just go
06:57 - ahead
06:58 - try to follow up and you will see where
07:01 - it gets problem problematic all right
07:05 - so we will need two things here to do
07:08 - uh right away one of them being is going
07:11 - into authentication and we will just
07:13 - need to go ahead and turn that on
07:15 - so we will be using we were just hitting
07:18 - on
07:19 - get started and we will be using
07:22 - google authentication so i'm just going
07:24 - to turn it on
07:25 - configure it so that's going to be my
07:27 - email then what's up uzbekistan
07:29 - hi nigeria what's good

09:57 - so going back into our vs code i think
10:00 - i'll zoom in a little just so you guys

10:04 - in there and i might move around a few
10:08 - different windows on my other screen

10:24 - little bit louder so you guys can hear
10:26 - it too
10:27 - and okay so what i will be doing here is
10:29 - i'm going into source folder
10:31 - all right and going into app.js now
10:34 - there is a
10:35 - ton of unnecessary stuff so if i go back
10:38 - in here
10:39 - start a new terminal in that same folder
10:42 - and just hit
10:42 - yarn start that will go ahead and open
10:46 - up the react app that i just created
10:49 - in this folder or in this browser window
10:52 - hopefully oh yeah i need to okay because
10:55 - i have something running on 3000 i have
10:57 - to
10:58 - open it in 3001 there we go
11:03 - so wait just a little bit or for it to
11:06 - low
11:07 - uh load and nope i am not going to use
11:10 - the redux
11:11 - today but i have a ton of stuff coming
11:15 - up that
11:15 - uh will use redux so yes i actually what
11:19 - watch the one hour of the new 2021

11:31 - video out
11:33 - yes oh my god thanks bro
11:38 - all right so with that said let's
11:41 - continue
11:42 - uh so i have this basic react app right
11:45 - over here i'm not going to be able to
11:48 - work with this too much so i'm just
11:51 - going to go ahead and delete everything
11:53 - inside of here and this extension is
11:57 - dying okay so
12:01 - i'm not going to use the logo anymore uh
12:04 - but notice that i keep the app css
12:06 - import over there
12:08 - next up i'm going to delete all the test
12:10 - files so app.test.js and setuptests.js
12:14 - is going to be deleted and how do i
12:18 - go about learning react from scratch you
12:20 - can learn it here
12:21 - if you know a little bit of html css and
12:24 - javascript
12:25 - this is the perfect place for you to
12:26 - start
12:28 - and i will also delete the logo.svg file
12:32 - going into the app.css file
12:36 - i will just delete everything that way i
12:39 - am just getting rid of all the styling
12:41 - what's up liam i remember okay guys
12:44 - i just want to stop here for a little
12:46 - bit uh
12:47 - liam amanoth and i were actually on a
12:51 - clubhouse
12:52 - zoom or clubhouse room this morning
12:55 - 8 a.m pacific so guys if you're
12:58 - interested in that
13:00 - make sure to check out uh amanoth and
13:03 - myself on uh clubhouse and just give us
13:06 - a follow so you guys
13:08 - know that we go live there every single
13:11 - day you can ask us whatever
13:13 - you can just chat with us this is
13:15 - basically you just bring your coffee
13:17 - tea whatever you drink and then just get
13:20 - started and we just
13:21 - shoot the right so
13:24 - that's an amazing way for uh anybody to
13:27 - just reach out to us uh nope
13:31 - i do not have a youtube channel i only
13:33 - create content on this very youtube
13:35 - channel
13:37 - and how much time does it take to learn
13:40 - react from scratch
13:41 - not a lot um
13:45 - i mean the more more hours you put in
13:47 - the faster you will get all right
13:48 - back to the code i deleted everything
13:52 - from the app.css file so this is amaze
13:54 - that's amazing
13:55 - uh i pretty much reset my css right now
13:58 - and my styling
14:00 - and going back going to index.css file
14:04 - you guys can see it
14:05 - up here uh i will be just going ahead
14:08 - and add
14:09 - a star and a margin of zero that means
14:13 - uh everything is going to be shrinked to
14:15 - the side of the window
14:17 - oh i should i maybe should make this
14:20 - circle a little bigger
14:23 - um okay i'll play around with that
14:27 - all right github profile of course
14:30 - um i'm not sure
14:34 - whatever uh so let's continue so i added
14:36 - a margin 0 and if i go back to app.js
14:40 - and add a h1 and just say what's up
14:45 - clever programmer fam
14:49 - and a rocket okay i sh
14:55 - okay where's my rocket mog
14:58 - okay that's a rock is even better so if
15:01 - i go ahead
15:02 - uh hit a little bit of the refresh i
15:03 - actually don't need to because react
15:05 - has automated refresh uh no i am not
15:08 - using obs studio i'm using ecam
15:11 - it's actually a bit better
15:15 - all right so now as you can see
15:18 - everything is on the top left corner so
15:21 - that is amazing we have our css set
15:24 - up back to normal so that's something
15:26 - cool
15:27 - and let's just get started right
15:31 - so quickly uh what are we going to be
15:33 - doing here
15:35 - so let's just uh start with a little bit
15:37 - of outline over here
15:39 - so first thing first uh we will need to
15:42 - authenticate the user so we will
15:44 - definitely need to have some
15:46 - authentication up top authentication
15:51 - right there uh
15:55 - and inside of here what we actually want
15:57 - to show
15:58 - is in case the user is not authenticated
16:01 - right so not or
16:04 - no authentication then what we want
16:08 - is we just want them to log in uh that's
16:11 - just going to be a
16:12 - super simple just a google drive logo
16:14 - and a button to log
16:16 - in that's going to be all it now in case
16:19 - the user has already logged in so
16:21 - auth equals true then
16:24 - what we will do is we want to have a
16:27 - sidebar we want to have a files
16:31 - uh view and we want to have a side
16:34 - icons now let me show you what i mean by
16:36 - that okay so if i go back here
16:39 - uh we obviously have a header on the top
16:41 - so
16:42 - that's something i forgot to uh right
16:44 - there but
16:45 - we would just put it there and
16:48 - we will also so this is the sidebar that
16:51 - we have here this is some sort of the
16:53 - main area this is
16:54 - i called it the files view this has a
16:56 - two
16:57 - uh two things one of them
17:00 - is these file cards on the top and the
17:02 - list of the files
17:04 - and if i go ahead and do this that's
17:07 - actually the side icon so by the way
17:10 - if i haven't showed you like i can
17:12 - pretty much go ahead
17:13 - and let me just switch back to my face
17:16 - and find a good image okay
17:18 - so if if i have this image over here and
17:21 - i say choose to upload and i hit upload
17:24 - it's actually going to start and go
17:25 - ahead and start
17:26 - uploading so this guy this guy's this is
17:29 - functional
17:29 - okay and it should be somewhere around
17:32 - here so i i think this is it
17:34 - uh this might be yes
17:38 - that was the image that i just
17:39 - downloaded so guys this
17:41 - google drive is actually functional
17:44 - you can upload and you can download
17:46 - files with it so
17:48 - as real world as it gets all right
17:52 - so we got 176 people
17:55 - live that is amazing guys give
17:57 - yourselves a round of applause
18:01 - oh boy i don't even know where my music
18:05 - is
18:05 - okay
18:09 - all right that's it okay uh
18:14 - so with that let's actually jump back
18:16 - into the code uh
18:17 - one question i'm new to front and side
18:19 - please suggest me
18:20 - how should i go uh should i go with view
18:23 - or react
18:24 - to land the job as a force that guy at
18:26 - first i would
18:28 - 100 suggest going with react
18:32 - easier to learn better future proof
18:35 - and everybody is on react so if you have
18:38 - react on your portfolio or resume or
18:40 - something
18:41 - that is almost guaranteed having a job
18:44 - already
18:45 - by the way we have a ton of people who
18:47 - have landed a job
18:48 - like landed jobs as uh react developers
18:52 - inside of our course profit with
18:54 - javascript so
18:56 - that's something to keep an eye on
18:58 - because we had jen who
19:00 - had who doubled her salary we had uh
19:03 - frank who got a 100 almost 180k
19:07 - uh project we have devin who is now
19:09 - working at paypal so
19:10 - just something to keep in mind all right
19:13 - uh
19:14 - let's go back to the build so uh
19:18 - i forgot the header i'm just gonna
19:21 - add it here and not worry about that so
19:24 - actually we just we are going to
19:26 - uh get results with uh uh get started
19:29 - with
19:30 - the header okay so
19:33 - uh for that what we will do is we will
19:37 - actually go ahead and create a few
19:38 - different
19:39 - uh folders because otherwise it would
19:42 - get hectic
19:43 - so i'm just gonna go ahead and say i
19:45 - will have a styles
19:48 - folder that's where all the css will go
19:50 - i will
19:51 - of course have a components folder
19:56 - and inside of that components that's
19:58 - where i will have my header
20:00 - okay so if i just go ahead and
20:04 - actually add another folder that's going
20:06 - to be my header
20:07 - and inside of that header folder i will
20:10 - have an index.js
20:12 - file okay make sense and guys this
20:15 - is a point where i want everybody to
20:18 - stop for a second and go into the
20:20 - extensions bar
20:23 - search for es7 and get this
20:27 - this is the number one best friend that
20:30 - you will
20:31 - ever have as a developer this tool
20:35 - has saved me so much time and headache
20:37 - and all that stuff
20:38 - so guys now go ahead and download that
20:41 - okay
20:42 - with that done i'm just going to go
20:43 - ahead and type in rafce
20:46 - hit return and that's why it's my friend
20:48 - because i typed in
20:49 - four letters and it gave me 12 lines of
20:52 - code
20:53 - this is a full working react component
20:56 - by the way
20:57 - all right so for the header we will have
21:00 - a few different stuff going on
21:02 - we obviously have a logo on the left
21:04 - hand side so let's get started with that
21:08 - uh contacts or redox go with redux
21:11 - always redux
21:12 - always try to future proof for yourself
21:15 - okay
21:16 - hey what's up dark spot academy welcome
21:20 - to the stream
21:21 - amazing to have you here all right
21:24 - and with that said
21:27 - right now what we will do is i'm just
21:29 - gonna give it a class name
21:31 - so when i'm referring to this uh in the
21:34 - css file i will know what's going on
21:37 - so uh let's just add the header over
21:40 - here
21:41 - in here and inside of there i will have
21:44 - a header
21:45 - underscore logo as well as later on a
21:50 - header search
21:53 - container right and we obviously have
21:59 - we will obviously have a few different
22:01 - icons so if you guys take a look at
22:03 - what's going on in here
22:05 - okay i need to log in okay so this is
22:07 - how we log in okay
22:08 - i just showed oh you show you guys how i
22:12 - log into this one
22:13 - so i'm just gonna go ahead hit my yup
22:15 - and
22:17 - with that said so
22:20 - on the top on the top that's my
22:23 - logo then we have our search bar
22:27 - and we have these icons okay so this is
22:30 - three different
22:31 - uh pl pieces these are the three
22:34 - different pieces
22:35 - of the header all right uh
22:38 - i'm just gonna reorganize my windows
22:40 - dope
22:41 - and so that's what we are building out
22:44 - now
22:45 - so i'm just gonna say header icons
22:49 - boom so that's pretty much how
22:52 - we outline the header so let's actually
22:54 - go ahead and do that
22:57 - um so what i will one so what i want to
23:00 - do is i want to have an
23:02 - image tag in here and a span
23:05 - which is going to say drive okay
23:08 - so that's pretty much how this is built
23:10 - up okay
23:11 - so for this file i highly highly
23:13 - recommend everybody goes ahead
23:15 - and search up google drive
23:18 - icon okay so if you just go and google
23:21 - it
23:22 - and go to the images you will want to
23:26 - select this icon okay the second one
23:29 - file
23:30 - colon google drive icon 2020.svg okay
23:34 - and you can just go ahead download it
23:36 - and work with that but because i have it
23:37 - downloaded i'm not going to waste too
23:40 - much time
23:40 - on that and i'm just going to grab this
23:44 - folder and put it in uh my source so i
23:47 - have this media folder right hear me out
23:49 - i have this media folder
23:51 - and i'm just gonna hit google drive icon
23:53 - and that's the file that i
23:55 - use okay so that's literally the one
23:57 - that i just
23:58 - showed you okay
24:02 - uh that being said though
24:06 - we can come back here and what i will do
24:09 - is i'm just gonna go ahead
24:11 - and import that google uh logo okay
24:15 - so the g drive logo is actually located
24:17 - in the media folder in
24:19 - as a the google drive logo.png
24:23 - okay all right
24:28 - who is actually with me just uh i don't
24:30 - know you can't show your hands but
24:32 - like just drop a yes in the chat if you
24:34 - are with me
24:35 - okay let me know where you guys at if
24:38 - i'm going too fast or what's going on
24:40 - let me know in the chat uh where are you
24:42 - guys at
24:44 - so
24:47 - yes yes okay amazing
24:51 - okay um
24:58 - dope that's good
25:00 - okay all right everybody okay dude
25:05 - i'm not i don't speak spanish bro
25:09 - amigo all right okay
25:13 - going back to the code then and what we
25:15 - will now do
25:16 - is because i have it imported i'm just
25:18 - gonna go ahead and copy and but guys by
25:20 - the way
25:21 - if you're not uh here with me
25:24 - don't worry i will put a github down
25:26 - below plus i have a
25:28 - faster um
25:31 - uh faster paced video of this very live
25:35 - uh soon up all right
25:38 - so and i'm just gonna put it in here
25:40 - between squiggly braces
25:42 - so that is actually gonna go ahead and
25:44 - import that and add it in there
25:46 - now i just uh
25:49 - opened up the app that i'm working so
25:53 - you would expect that i would have that
25:55 - logo in there
25:56 - but i don't the reason for that is i
25:58 - haven't actually imported it
26:00 - in here so what i will do
26:03 - is i'm just gonna go ahead and
26:06 - uh i'm just gonna add the header
26:09 - all right so let's just say header
26:13 - and close it now this is going to freak
26:17 - out now because i still haven't imported
26:20 - it i just added the tag
26:21 - right so that's not not how it works you
26:23 - need to import it so i'm just going to
26:25 - go ahead hit import
26:26 - say header and i'm i'm going to go ahead
26:29 - and say
26:29 - four and in there
26:33 - in the components folder in the header
26:36 - that's where i have it okay
26:38 - boom that's it and we have the drive and
26:41 - we have
26:42 - the logo so that's amazing
26:45 - uh i can see the code
26:49 - even 480.
26:53 - that's good all right so with that said
26:56 - we have
26:57 - a working header now let's go back and
26:59 - finish that
27:00 - up because it's by far not finished
27:04 - so for the logo part we're pretty much
27:06 - that's that's all what we will be doing
27:09 - um we only need an image and a span tag
27:13 - now for the rest um
27:17 - we will have a search bar right
27:22 - so let's take a look at how it would
27:24 - look like so we will obviously have a
27:26 - search bar in there
27:27 - in the search container because the
27:30 - containers actually strips out all the
27:32 - way
27:32 - let me just let me show you let me show
27:33 - you so as you can see
27:36 - in as in the normal google drive uh
27:39 - this is the search bar but the icons
27:42 - don't start all the way
27:43 - just on the right hand side so all this
27:45 - space is actually filled up with the
27:48 - pretty much nothing but that's where the
27:50 - container takes place because that's
27:52 - going to push everything to the sides
27:55 - and then
27:56 - have the uh search in there okay
28:01 - uh
28:05 - i mean that that's a good point that you
28:08 - just made
28:10 - i can change that like why not okay we
28:15 - let's actually do that real quick so if
28:17 - i go into public go into indexes html
28:20 - and go into here and i'm gonna say
28:24 - google drive
28:28 - clever programmer
28:32 - bank there we go that's a good one
28:35 - that's a good catch okay
28:39 - so that's a good catch all right so if
28:41 - you if you're into that you can go ahead
28:43 - and do the same
28:44 - um not really necessary but it's a good
28:47 - catch
28:48 - all right so
28:51 - inside of there we definitely want to
28:53 - have the uh header search bar
28:56 - uh as a
28:58 - separate div right make sense and in
29:01 - there
29:02 - we will have a few different things that
29:04 - we will need to add
29:06 - in we will need to have this search icon
29:10 - this uh
29:13 - i don't even know what this is yes it is
29:16 - the google tribe clone
29:19 - okay and what editor do i use i use vs
29:23 - code but with a fancy theme and for that
29:26 - to know which theme i'm using you will
29:27 - have to wait for another video
29:30 - and you will obviously need to add the
29:32 - search and drive
29:33 - text now for this this is where actually
29:36 - material ui comes in if you guys don't
29:39 - know what it is
29:40 - material ui is the design language of
29:43 - google
29:44 - so all this is actually using material
29:47 - ui
29:49 - and so material ui
29:52 - okay it's the design language of google
29:54 - and it has a
29:56 - bunch of icons uh what are amazing and
29:59 - we will just use those
30:01 - so going back to my browser uh
30:04 - what we will do is you can just go ahead
30:06 - and search up
30:08 - uh material
30:12 - ui icons and that will give it
30:16 - give all this stuff for us am i really
30:18 - crap yes i am thank you yes i am
30:23 - and you know who's clever who smashes
30:26 - those like buttons right
30:28 - all right going back here uh the first
30:30 - one is the one that we want to have yeah
30:32 - dr
30:33 - drop down that's a good good name okay
30:35 - uh
30:36 - so we definitely want to have the search
30:38 - which is going to be this
30:40 - so i just want to go ahead and save it
30:42 - and it's actually called
30:45 - expand more i think
30:48 - yeah expand more icons and those those
30:51 - are the two that you want to save
30:53 - now this isn't
30:56 - everything that we will be using because
30:58 - we have to go into the terminal
31:00 - and we will have to install a few
31:02 - different stuff so i would just type in
31:04 - yarn add
31:05 - at material dash ui
31:08 - core and this is not enough because we
31:11 - will need to
31:12 - install the material ui icons as well
31:17 - but those come
31:20 - after the course so make sure that you
31:22 - first install the core
31:24 - and then the icons all right so
31:27 - let's actually wait a little bit
31:31 - uh anu yoshi
31:34 - asks if he's late no you're not bro
31:37 - uh we already started but don't worry uh
31:39 - you can just
31:40 - continue where we left off or you can
31:42 - just go ahead and watch it
31:44 - uh but we will have a chopped up version
31:48 - of this video
31:49 - up in a few days or something uh
31:52 - but this is actually a good way that you
31:54 - can ask questions if you're here live
31:56 - and i can answer those
31:58 - so with that said i have installed all
32:01 - these stuff
32:02 - uh what are my advices for younger
32:04 - developers just start bro and just do it
32:07 - stick with it 14 hours a day you can do
32:09 - it
32:12 - all right uh is the search work or just
32:15 - design
32:16 - it's just a design for now but
32:19 - you can make it working like the the
32:23 - the reason why we do all these builds is
32:25 - that you can
32:26 - get these and understand what's going on
32:30 - and how to build these sort of stuff
32:32 - and then later on you can take this into
32:34 - your own projects
32:35 - and maybe if the client if you're a
32:37 - freelance developer
32:38 - wants to ha uh once they have the
32:40 - ability to upload files and then list
32:42 - them
32:43 - this is the app that you will use and
32:45 - you can you you already have an
32:46 - understanding of what's going on
32:48 - all right so
32:51 - actually we might as well just go ahead
32:53 - and build a search engine sometime all
32:55 - right
32:56 - in here we will just go ahead and uh
33:00 - add these two so the search icon and the
33:03 - expand more icon
33:05 - are going uh are gonna be coming in here
33:08 - and i will wrap this inside of the
33:11 - search
33:12 - search one boom and
33:15 - the expand more
33:18 - where is my expand more icon that's it
33:23 - um i messed it up
33:26 - okay i want this to be here and in
33:28 - between
33:29 - i want to have an input
33:33 - yes an input
33:37 - come on okay input
33:40 - type text
33:45 - and placeholder is going to be
33:49 - search in drive
33:53 - yes all right okay this is how you want
33:56 - to build it so
33:57 - inside of the search bar i will have the
33:59 - search icon the input box and the expand
34:02 - more
34:02 - icon okay um
34:06 - yes i do recommend yarn and
34:09 - no i don't have kobe 19. what's the kind
34:12 - of question bro
34:14 - uh so yes if you if you're debating
34:16 - between yarn and mpm
34:18 - just go with yarn that's more future
34:19 - proof that's newer uh
34:21 - not a lot of developers know about it
34:23 - but if you guys if you just like
34:26 - speed is everything and the art is
34:27 - faster that's it
34:29 - uh you will spend 20 uh plenty of times
34:33 - uh
34:33 - debugging so that's my take on that okay
34:36 - search icon
34:37 - we have all this stuff ready so we are
34:39 - pretty much the functional
34:41 - functionality of things are getting
34:43 - together
34:44 - so yeah there we have all these things
34:47 - now
34:48 - we want to go ahead and add those icons
34:51 - in there as well and this is where
34:54 - things are gonna get crazy uh
34:57 - because we will have a few different
35:00 - kind of uh
35:02 - i don't know styling going on here so
35:05 - what we will do
35:06 - is okay first let me actually show you
35:09 - what's happening
35:10 - in the original one is i actually cloned
35:14 - it from the real google drive so
35:16 - yeah but we have these two icons over
35:20 - here
35:21 - yes and a little space and this icon and
35:23 - that icon
35:24 - okay so that's how um
35:29 - um that that's that's just how google
35:31 - drive is
35:32 - okay so we will clone that we will add a
35:34 - little spacing in there but that's it
35:36 - so inside of the icons what we will do
35:38 - is we will add a span tag and
35:40 - in there we will have two icons and
35:43 - another icon
35:44 - and an image so the image tag will
35:47 - actually
35:47 - use the uh user photo
35:51 - that is actually logged in
35:55 - okay so if i were to go uh log out of
35:57 - the other one and then just log in with
35:59 - the
35:59 - with a new account that image would be
36:01 - showing up but
36:03 - uh that's gonna be used later so
36:06 - uh what's the name of the color theme
36:08 - used
36:10 - make sure to stick around for my
36:11 - ultimate 2021
36:13 - top 10 extensions that will make you a
36:16 - better
36:16 - and more effective developer uh with
36:20 - these extensions video i'm
36:22 - still coming up with the name kinda uh
36:26 - that's where i will be releasing that
36:27 - all right
36:29 - so we will have a few different icons
36:32 - coming
36:33 - into play we will have the help outline
36:35 - the settings icon
36:37 - and the apps icon so these two
36:41 - are actually going in the span and we
36:43 - will have the apps icon
36:45 - coming right under again these are
36:49 - coming from materia
36:50 - ui and obviously we need to uh
36:54 - insta and import them okay so you can go
36:57 - ahead check those
36:58 - out and and yeah
37:02 - uh that's pretty much how it is
37:05 - built up uh okay so we have all these
37:09 - importation
37:10 - uh i don't want to spend too much time
37:12 - on it and
37:14 - yeah let's continue so why do i have two
37:16 - index.js because notice that
37:18 - i have the components and inside of
37:20 - components i have the header
37:22 - and this is the index.js file of the
37:23 - header component okay
37:25 - so that's actually a that's actually
37:28 - that will actually come into place when
37:30 - you will be
37:30 - building bigger projects than this one
37:33 - or like huge stuff and then
37:35 - you will thank me for putting showing
37:38 - you this
37:39 - kind of technique and organization of
37:42 - files all right let's go ahead check
37:45 - back to our
37:46 - application hello hamza uh
37:50 - okay so that's pretty much how it looks
37:53 - like
37:53 - for now don't worry about uh it it's
37:57 - kind of ugly but we will just go ahead
37:59 - and take care of it so if we go into our
38:02 - styles folder and
38:04 - just hit
38:08 - the header i think
38:12 - hold on a second
38:18 - yeah so if you're just gonna go ahead
38:20 - and add a new file called the
38:22 - header dot css and we're just gonna
38:26 - start
38:26 - adding in stuff so if i target the
38:29 - header
38:29 - and add a display of flex everything is
38:33 - going to be
38:34 - uh next to each other i will add a
38:37 - height of 60 pixels and a border bottom
38:42 - of one pixel solid i said solid
38:47 - and rgb 219
38:51 - 219 and 219.
38:54 - that is actually a nice little grayish
38:57 - tat um it's still okay i haven't
39:01 - imported it okay
39:02 - so one thing that as a react developer
39:04 - you don't want to miss out on
39:06 - is importing the style files otherwise
39:09 - your application is gonna
39:10 - look ugly even if you've created a css
39:12 - file so that's something you to keep an
39:14 - eye on i just made the mistakes
39:16 - uh so yeah that's something so
39:19 - what i will do is i'm just gonna go
39:22 - ahead and
39:22 - import the file using this line of code
39:26 - so it says import
39:27 - i will go up a folder into the
39:29 - components one and then go another one
39:31 - up into the source one and then go into
39:34 - styles and
39:35 - grab the header.css file
39:40 - so uh always use up the
39:45 - you can use app.css but then it's get uh
39:48 - super cluttered
39:49 - yeah um all right
39:54 - so now i should have that uh something
39:57 - happening okay so if i
39:58 - zoom in here a bit this is the display
40:01 - facts that everything is getting next to
40:02 - each other
40:03 - and i have this nice little border
40:05 - bottom uh
40:07 - 60 pixels below the top of
40:10 - the screen so i have this plant on my
40:12 - desk
40:13 - and it's on the way of my mike's boom
40:16 - arm
40:17 - so excuse this uh stuff
40:20 - uh if you mention i sorry about what's
40:23 - your ide it is vs code i am using vs
40:26 - code i am trying to
40:27 - move away from vs code because i hate it
40:30 - but
40:31 - this is the best
40:34 - it's a little crazy but that's what it
40:36 - is so going back to our header.css file
40:41 - uh i actually want to make sure that the
40:44 - width
40:45 - of this is a 100 view width and
40:49 - we are pretty much done styling the
40:50 - header as a whole
40:53 - uh thank you so much uh he
40:56 - uh that saying my content is useful i
40:59 - really appreciate your being here so
41:02 - that's uh that's amazing and i'm super
41:04 - glad that i can give you guys value
41:07 - so what i will do now
41:11 - is uh next up i will
41:15 - trigger all the divs inside of my header
41:18 - and i will just add a padding of 12
41:21 - pixels and going down
41:24 - uh i will trigger my header logo and
41:27 - i will get a bit faster because this is
41:29 - gonna be the most boring part like this
41:32 - this is just not that right okay uh
41:36 - so my header logo i want that to be
41:38 - display of flex i want to justify the
41:41 - content to flex
41:42 - start and i want to align everything so
41:46 - align
41:46 - means that vertically i'm aligning
41:48 - everything to the center what's up
41:50 - clever programmer
41:53 - uh and we will
41:57 - align everything to the center so let's
42:00 - actually
42:00 - check out what i am doing here so i'm
42:03 - trying to
42:04 - fit that uh icon in the middle
42:08 - uh but for some reason it's still too
42:11 - big okay so we will just address that
42:13 - issue right now
42:15 - uh so what i will be doing
42:19 - is i will just uh target the header
42:23 - logo and inside of there remember we
42:25 - have this image tag okay so that is the
42:28 - logo
42:29 - uh i would just give it a height of a
42:30 - 100 percent so that will take up 100
42:34 - of the parent's height okay so the
42:36 - parent is the header logo
42:37 - and the image is going to be as high as
42:39 - the header logo okay
42:41 - and i'm just gonna add something nice an
42:44 - object fit actually let's let let's just
42:46 - let let's just take a look at how it
42:47 - looks like now
42:48 - that's not not really good but i want to
42:51 - add in
42:52 - object fit contain and now
42:55 - everything is going to look much much
42:58 - nicer
42:59 - i'm just going to add a little bit of uh
43:01 - spacing
43:02 - in between otherwise it will look ugly
43:06 - so let's do that so inside of header
43:10 - logo
43:10 - i will have this pen uh which will have
43:14 - a color of gray okay
43:18 - and we will we will all also want to add
43:21 - a
43:21 - font size of 20 pixels
43:24 - right 20 pixels a font weight
43:27 - of 500 and a margin
43:31 - left of 16 pixels okay let's take a look
43:35 - at how it looks like now
43:36 - so much more like google drive okay so
43:40 - like just notice the differences like
43:42 - it's it's grayish
43:43 - it's uh it has those little bit of uh
43:46 - span in there so
43:47 - yeah like i said your css components
43:51 - with style components for example uh
43:54 - in this tutorial i am not using style
43:56 - components but
43:57 - i will have a few different tutorials
44:00 - but i will be using style components so
44:03 - i just want to diversify the content
44:04 - that we have here
44:06 - um so yeah for now i will be uh going
44:09 - with
44:10 - different uh css files all right
44:15 - let me actually drink a bit
44:18 - what's up ben
44:22 - burn is coming back
44:25 - all right
44:29 - so now that i have styled that drive
44:32 - logo uh let's move on to the search
44:34 - container okay so this is going to be
44:36 - the part that we are building out
44:38 - this over here so everything
44:41 - from there all the way here
44:44 - i hope you guys can see that all right
44:48 - going back i'm just gonna say
44:51 - uh dot header and search
44:54 - container and it will
44:57 - i will give it a flex of one display of
45:01 - flex and by the way the flexo one is
45:03 - actually going to
45:04 - stretch out all the way to both sides
45:07 - and it will just smash
45:09 - everything just like you smashing the
45:10 - like button but it will smash
45:12 - everything to the sides and yeah
45:16 - so that's why i do that and what i will
45:19 - be doing
45:19 - is i have made the tesla homepage that's
45:22 - very good thanks for teaching us
45:24 - amazing i'm super pumped that you've
45:26 - made that
45:28 - all right and so display of flex and
45:31 - next up i will align the items to the
45:33 - center so
45:34 - vertically i have everything to the
45:36 - center added
45:37 - and i'm adding a padding of eight
45:41 - pixels i turn the like button blue for
45:44 - the mirror coming back
45:45 - that's what i'm talking about guys be
45:47 - like ben
45:48 - smash the like button make sure it looks
45:51 - blue just like my background and make
45:53 - sure to smash it
45:54 - in an uneven numbers okay because
45:57 - otherwise if you smash it like
45:59 - two four six eight times it's actually
46:01 - going to end up being
46:03 - unsmashed and that's not the desired
46:05 - outcome okay
46:07 - all right enough of me talking about
46:09 - smashing the like button
46:11 - so uh amazing kyle i love uh
46:14 - i'm so pumped that you find it enjoyable
46:17 - awesome
46:18 - yes we will have a twitter clone that's
46:20 - an amazing one
46:22 - thank you so much uh
46:25 - why are you not using sass i will be
46:27 - using
46:28 - sas in other tutorials this one is plain
46:31 - css so search container and now moving
46:34 - on to the header
46:36 - search bar
46:39 - and it will have a width of 45
46:43 - a height of 120 percent
46:47 - a border radius of 6 pixels
46:52 - and a background color of rgb
46:56 - and this is going to be 237
46:59 - 237 oh my god what did i
47:03 - mess up i messed something up hold on
47:06 - rgb once again two three seven boom
47:10 - two three seven boom two three seven two
47:13 - that's it
47:13 - okay now it's cool
47:17 - uh will you do view streams nope i'm not
47:20 - planning to do view streams but
47:22 - guys if you really want to i will do
47:25 - view streams
47:26 - why not but uh i actually don't
47:29 - recommend
47:30 - uh learning view it's just such a pain
47:32 - in the ass but
47:33 - whatever for you guys i'll do anything
47:37 - next up uh we will be aligning the items
47:41 - to the center in there as well
47:45 - so you might be asking why am i aligning
47:47 - everything to the center because i want
47:49 - everything to be
47:50 - in the center makes sense right
47:53 - and we will be we will be giving it a
47:57 - padding
47:57 - of zero and eight pixels now what's
48:01 - happening here
48:02 - uh on the top and the bottom
48:05 - i think that's the zero and on the right
48:07 - and the left that's going to be eight
48:08 - pixels
48:09 - i think that's how that's how it is yes
48:12 - yes yes
48:14 - and guys please make sure that only talk
48:17 - in
48:18 - english in the comments um because
48:21 - otherwise
48:21 - i will feel insecure and uh run
48:24 - away from here what about the discord
48:27 - clone we actually have one but
48:29 - i can't make it better if you want to
48:34 - inside of the uh
48:37 - like it's going to be a little bit of
48:39 - global but i want to set
48:41 - the color of these icons right over here
48:45 - to be great by the way let's take a look
48:46 - at how our app looks like
48:49 - kind of getting there right kind of
48:50 - getting there not ugly not
48:52 - that ugly as it was okay we have this
48:55 - nice little
48:56 - background area and and we are getting
48:59 - there okay
49:00 - so now we're just gonna set the color of
49:02 - those
49:03 - svg icons and that actually has a
49:06 - specific
49:07 - uh class which is uh available at
49:10 - material ui icon documentation but it is
49:14 - the mui
49:16 - icon-root and i want to set the color of
49:20 - rgb828282
49:23 - also what about a clone that hosts a
49:24 - website what do you mean
49:26 - like uh hostinger clone
49:34 - uh yeah okay so we just set those colors
49:39 - those just turned a little grayish i
49:42 - don't know if you guys can see it i
49:44 - just barely but yeah all right next
49:47 - up let's actually get rid of that ugly
49:50 - uh search thing or
49:53 - input while making it nice okay
49:57 - so advice to upcoming programmers do it
49:59 - bro put in the hours
50:00 - work for it and it will be amazing
50:04 - next up
50:07 - why isn't
50:10 - all right here we go so next up i will
50:13 - be uh
50:14 - targeting the header um
50:17 - search bar under sq uh
50:21 - and inside of there the input
50:24 - and it will have a flux of one
50:29 - a height of 60 percent
50:32 - a font size of 16 pixels
50:36 - a color of light gray
50:40 - and yes and a background
50:44 - of none because we want we just want to
50:47 - cancel that out like
50:48 - it's actually a bad bad thing that html
50:52 - inputs have those ugly background and
50:54 - it's a good way for you to learn
50:56 - how to remove all that ugliness
50:59 - oh we also want to cancel out all the
51:01 - borders and the margin
51:03 - left is going to be so margin
51:08 - left is gonna be 12 pixels let's take a
51:10 - look at how it looks like now
51:14 - okay nothing has changed so
51:17 - far something's up
51:20 - um yeah oh yeah
51:25 - i added this d there okay it was a typo
51:27 - it's always a typo
51:29 - okay we have that thing okay
51:32 - and for some reason the flex one not
51:34 - seem to be working but we will take a
51:37 - look
51:37 - at that it's important to put root yes
51:40 - it is
51:40 - important uh because otherwise it's not
51:43 - going to target that specific
51:45 - uh item okay so
51:48 - uh header folk header search bar and
51:51 - in what we will do is once again we will
51:55 - uh get that input but we want to get rid
51:59 - of that ugly
52:00 - blue-ish border once we
52:04 - focus in there so we were just gonna say
52:06 - outline
52:07 - it's gonna be none and a color of
52:10 - black because that's what the uh tags
52:13 - that we type in
52:14 - we want that so we want the text that we
52:18 - type in to be black
52:19 - okay and
52:22 - yeah so if i type in here it's going to
52:24 - be black amazing dope
52:28 - okay something's up all right whatever
52:31 - uh we will
52:32 - take care of that in a bit
52:35 - um okay so the header icons
52:39 - let's actually i'm gonna go ahead and do
52:41 - this
52:45 - okay
52:48 - [Music]
52:51 - yeah same
52:54 - okay there we go dope all right
52:57 - uh so next up we will move on to the
53:01 - header icons so header
53:04 - underscore icons and in there we will
53:08 - obviously have a this play
53:12 - of flex and a align
53:15 - items dot center and
53:18 - a margin right of third minus
53:22 - 30 pixels so that's good
53:25 - and once again we will target all those
53:28 - icons inside of there uh
53:32 - oh yeah i could have forgotten that
53:34 - that's a good catch
53:37 - uh so we will add a header
53:41 - icons and inside of there we want to
53:44 - target those
53:45 - mui svg icons actually i think that
53:48 - stands for material ui because that
53:50 - makes sense
53:51 - and going down font size we will give it
53:54 - a
53:55 - 28 pixels a color
53:58 - of 82 8282 just like how we had it so
54:02 - once again i think the autocomplete will
54:05 - give it to me
54:06 - yes that's it you want to be as
54:09 - efficient as possible
54:10 - as a developer guys who can follow me
54:13 - who is with me
54:14 - drop it in the comments drop it in the
54:17 - chat i want to know who is with me
54:22 - come don't say that come on
54:30 - yes i do all right
54:33 - and inside of there we will also want to
54:36 - add a margin of 4 pixels
54:39 - i just got here what's up omera hey
54:42 - let's go
54:43 - massive shout out to everybody who's was
54:46 - here and
54:47 - okay you guys are with me
54:52 - i'll make sure the mixing is gonna be
54:54 - better next time
54:58 - whatever all right uh we got the margin
55:01 - of four pixels that is amazing and going
55:04 - down a little bit
55:07 - uh we will have the header
55:10 - icons and inside of that we obviously
55:13 - have that span okay
55:15 - and that will have a margin right of 20
55:18 - pixels
55:19 - and guys this is only for to make it
55:22 - look amazing
55:26 - um so

56:07 - will give
56:08 - a border radius of 50 percent
56:12 - a height of 100 percent an
56:15 - object fit of contain and the margin
56:19 - left
56:19 - of five pixels
56:24 - taking a look at how we got it uh
56:27 - we still have a little bit of fixing to
56:28 - do
56:32 - i think i forgot some sort of uh display
56:34 - flex somewhere
56:36 - whatever let's take a look at it i i
56:38 - think i think i forget it here
56:40 - display of flex let's say let's take a
56:42 - look if it fixes my problems
56:44 - yes it does there we go so once we pass
56:48 - then once we actually set up the login
56:50 - over there
56:51 - there will be a icon from google
56:55 - that one okay boom okay let's
56:58 - let's actually use a dummy uh something
57:02 - that you guys can go ahead and
57:03 - use too uh i will be just
57:07 - i've actually have this on my clipboard
57:09 - right now
57:10 - and over here i'm just going to add this
57:12 - in here
57:14 - remove the comment boom and i will
57:17 - obviously need to
57:19 - import uh the use date
57:24 - you stay stay with me for a little
57:27 - second and i will explain what i'm doing
57:29 - right now so this is only for
57:32 - demonstration purposes you guys don't
57:33 - have to watch the
57:34 - uh watch this whole thing i'm just going
57:36 - to show you guys what i am about to
57:38 - what i've just set up and we will have
57:42 - a user image user photo
57:45 - user photo one second
57:49 - and showing what i've done
57:53 - uh user dot photo url bang
57:57 - and then copy this
58:01 - go here the structure boom
58:06 - and and then add
58:09 - that here
58:14 - boom all right so uh you see this icon
58:17 - here
58:18 - that's what i added just right now okay
58:21 - so
58:21 - quickly what i've done here uh i
58:25 - actually built this project earlier and
58:26 - i have a snippet of code that contains a
58:29 - login data
58:31 - for my uh account
58:34 - so we will actually add the
58:36 - authentication at the very end because
58:38 - otherwise you will have to uh always
58:41 - keep signing in which actually slows you
58:43 - down and i don't want you to
58:45 - uh you don't want to do that so for
58:48 - that i just added that icon here so i
58:50 - can show you what's going
58:52 - what's going on and what's happening
58:53 - over there
58:55 - and why did i do all the styling that i
58:57 - did
58:58 - now and we will add the styling later on
59:01 - so
59:01 - don't worry about that we will get there
59:04 - just
59:05 - soon enough okay yes i will reveal my
59:09 - code themes and fonts inside in one of
59:12 - my next videos
59:16 - uh want to learning rjs help learning
59:19 - i'm a php developer
59:20 - um just stay here on this channel we
59:23 - pretty much give you a ton of stuff
59:25 - that you can learn from all right
59:29 - guys we are pretty much done with the
59:30 - header just saying uh
59:32 - this is amazing if you are here with me
59:35 - who actually has that head already
59:38 - because
59:38 - this is actually one dope looking header
59:41 - now we can
59:42 - go and continue on
59:46 - yes is the it's the full app
59:49 - yes it's the full app okay and
59:53 - uh we will now add the uh
59:56 - sidebar okay so
60:00 - for that i'm just creating a new folder
60:04 - and inside of that i will have a few
60:07 - different things
60:08 - happening obviously i will have any
60:12 - index.js file right
60:16 - dope and i just want to make sure that
60:19 - everything is imported
60:21 - so we will be importing it right away
60:24 - but first
60:27 - first i would just create a new
60:28 - component with r a f c
60:30 - e and for that
60:33 - [Music]
60:35 - and what's gonna happen here is that we
60:37 - will have a few different things
60:39 - happening
60:40 - i want to make everything a component
60:43 - because i
60:44 - i kind of want like uh
60:48 - i i want to break down every big problem
60:51 - to
60:52 - uh small little problems so we will have
60:54 - a component that will be the
60:56 - add new file button then we will have
60:59 - all these little bit little buttons
61:02 - right over here
61:03 - which are going to be brand new uh
61:07 - items okay so that's actually
61:11 - and actually if i hover over all these
61:13 - uh this have that nice little google
61:15 - drive effect
61:16 - you have done a youtube channel yes we
61:17 - have uh
61:20 - going back in here so what i will do
61:25 - is obviously i add a class name which is
61:28 - going to be
61:29 - side bar that's dope
61:33 - and this is where my new file
61:36 - component will go okay and
61:40 - yes i will share the project source code
61:42 - down below in the description check back
61:44 - later tomorrow
61:45 - uh later today or early tomorrow and i
61:48 - will have it there okay
61:50 - so next up we will have a sidebar
61:54 - i damns container
61:57 - boom and those will contain all the
62:01 - sidebar items so those are gonna be
62:05 - imported little uh components as
62:08 - well so now we will add a hr
62:13 - which is going which is actually stands
62:14 - for horizontal row
62:16 - line or something and we will have an
62:19 - other
62:20 - sidebar element
62:23 - in here so uh
62:26 - we're good there we have created the
62:28 - structure now let's go ahead and
62:30 - make those new files and all those stuff
62:33 - ready so first thing first uh what we
62:36 - definitely want to do
62:38 - is add a new file in here which is going
62:40 - to be the new
62:41 - file the new new file which is going to
62:44 - be in the new file oh
62:45 - it's funny uh so the new file is
62:48 - actually going to be another component
62:50 - just like
62:51 - the other and we will add a class name
62:54 - which is going to be
62:55 - new file and that's dope and that will
62:59 - have a new
63:00 - file conte
63:03 - trainer and so yeah that's good
63:07 - and we will add a plus icon in there
63:11 - i actually guys i don't know if it helps
63:13 - you but it definitely helps me a
63:15 - ton um if i just comment out what's
63:20 - happening
63:20 - in here uh just search me up on whatever
63:24 - social media technology android apps
63:26 - uh if you want to communicate me just
63:28 - literally search me up and that will be
63:30 - it
63:36 - yeah and we will obviously have a text
63:39 - of new
63:40 - that's it now this will actually pop
63:44 - up a model in a little bit of later
63:48 - pro please explain where to store the
63:50 - client input data
63:51 - uh we will be storing that in a
63:55 - i'm not exactly sure what you mean but
63:57 - if it's the files we will be uploading
63:58 - those to firebase
64:01 - we will get started with that soon
64:03 - enough um
64:09 - we are actually using firebase okay
64:11 - let's go ahead
64:12 - and continue so
64:16 - that's kind of how it will look like but
64:18 - let's go back to the material ui
64:20 - and what we will have is we want to
64:24 - grab a something called the add icon
64:27 - and that's what we will be adding uh
64:32 - in there okay so we will have the
64:36 - add icon boom
64:39 - so that's good and
64:42 - that's what we will have here so that's
64:44 - pretty much a plus icon we just need to
64:46 - import all these stuff
64:49 - so so we will say new uh oops
64:52 - a new a file yes
64:56 - it auto imports it as you can see on
64:59 - line number two
65:00 - and i'm not sure if i've imported
65:03 - sidebar but i guess i haven't
65:05 - so i'm just gonna say import sidebar
65:08 - from
65:09 - dot slash component slash sidebar
65:14 - which is dope because now i can add
65:18 - the sidebar under here and for now i'm
65:23 - just gonna be
65:24 - uh at oops
65:28 - like that so for now i'm just gonna be
65:30 - adding those there so we can just uh
65:32 - mess around with all that stuff and once
65:34 - we add the
65:35 - uh authentication we will be
65:38 - finishing things up and making them
65:40 - looking nice
65:43 - uh and we would have the we will have
65:46 - the ability to
65:48 - um we will add the ability to sign in
65:52 - and then different stuff will be showing
65:54 - up so
65:56 - for uh for here we will have a start
65:59 - step we will have a sidebar items
66:03 - or sidebar sidebar item.js
66:07 - file which is obviously going to be
66:09 - another
66:10 - um component
66:16 - and yeah that's pretty much how it will
66:19 - be so
66:20 - r-a-f-c-e once again dope
66:23 - and we will be adding a class name of
66:27 - sidebar item
66:31 - like this okay and
66:35 - it will contain a sidebar
66:40 - so sometimes okay so if you actually go
66:43 - to the normal
66:44 - google drive some of these icons have
66:48 - that little bit
66:48 - little thing right before and we will
66:51 - have to do some sort of conditional
66:53 - rendering so for
66:54 - that we will be doing this uh
66:58 - thing
67:01 - so this means we have a div anyways
67:04 - uh but if we pass in the arrow then we
67:08 - want to add the arrow right
67:10 - arrow right icon which is going to be
67:14 - imported once again from material ui so
67:17 - that's amazing but
67:18 - in case that's not the case we just want
67:21 - to
67:22 - render out the icon and the label
67:25 - so we will be passing in the icon and we
67:28 - will be passing in
67:29 - the label uh sorry guys what is the
67:33 - plugin vs
67:34 - uh that serves the file size import
67:38 - uh that is something that will come in a
67:41 - extension video it's i think it's by the
67:43 - way input cost i think
67:45 - uh but you want to make sure just uh
67:48 - stay tuned for that because i have
67:49 - new uh i have other stuff that just make
67:52 - the
67:52 - code go crazy if i uh mess something up
67:56 - so yeah why do i structure my files like
67:59 - that because uh
68:01 - if i would have a big big project
68:04 - i would need to make it make it look
68:08 - amazing
68:08 - make it easily uh
68:12 - see if i can just navigate easily
68:13 - between those files okay
68:15 - so with that said we are pretty much
68:17 - done with the sidebar item we just need
68:20 - to
68:20 - throw in a few different stuff which we
68:22 - obviously destructure
68:24 - on the top so we will have the arrow the
68:27 - icon and the label
68:28 - so that's cool and coming in here
68:32 - uh we will be passing in a few different
68:35 - things
68:35 - so if i go ahead and do this
68:39 - uh i will be using the sidebar
68:43 - uh sidebar item right
68:46 - so for the first two i'm passing in that
68:49 - arrow thing so once the arrow is
68:51 - being passed in i will be rendering out
68:53 - this error right
68:54 - icon and i obviously pass in
68:58 - the icon that i want to show
69:01 - and for that and next to it i want to uh
69:05 - i want to see my drive showing up so you
69:07 - got guys by the way this
69:09 - can actually totally be copied from here
69:12 - uh you can pretty much do that i don't
69:14 - really want to waste anybody's time and
69:16 - if you're here just watching it would
69:18 - take
69:19 - a ton of time to uh
69:23 - manually import so what i will do is
69:26 - just
69:26 - pass all these in these are obviously
69:29 - coming from material ui
69:31 - usually the auto import imports them
69:34 - but this is how pretty much we do it
69:37 - so and obviously we have this one more
69:40 - thing
69:41 - um yeah my girlfriend is commenting that
69:44 - the food is the food has arrived
69:48 - yeah i'm hungry too uh
69:52 - so this one last icon comes in here and
69:55 - if i take a look at how it looks like
69:57 - now we have all these icons going around
69:59 - and we will just need to make this style
70:03 - look
70:03 - amazing so for that uh
70:07 - we will add a new css file which we will
70:10 - call the sidebar.css and before i
70:13 - actually create it i'm just going to go
70:14 - ahead and import it
70:16 - and let's go ahead and do that so
70:20 - sidebar dot css boom
70:24 - and yeah for okay let's take a look at
70:27 - that
70:28 - so inside of there
70:32 - inside of there what we would do is we
70:34 - would say sidebar
70:35 - and we would hit say a width
70:39 - of a 15 percent okay because we don't
70:42 - want this to shrink out all the way
70:44 - uh on the full page but we want that
70:47 - to be the case uh when it comes to
70:50 - vertical stuff okay
70:52 - and we will give it a margin right of 5
70:55 - pixels
70:56 - so it can actually breathe okay margin
71:00 - oh come on margin
71:04 - right of 5 pixels so that's super
71:07 - dope now as far as the hr
71:11 - goes we will have a background color of
71:14 - rgb
71:15 - and it's just going to be one seven one
71:17 - ninety seven
71:18 - one nine seven and one nine seven again
71:28 - dang so this is actually once again this
71:33 - lighter grayish color let's take a look
71:36 - at how
71:36 - we look like that's something but
71:40 - we obviously need to uh make sure that
71:44 - the sidebar items look
71:46 - looks nice so for that we actually use
71:49 - the sidebar item.css file
71:51 - now let's take a look at that so side
71:56 - sidebar item dot css
72:03 - oh jesus
72:06 - come on c sharp ew
72:09 - uh so
72:16 - del manos remove that dude
72:21 - so for that what we will do is the
72:23 - sidebar item
72:24 - is going to be the following so
72:28 - we're just gonna uh target that and
72:31 - we will give it a display of flex
72:35 - we will give it a padding of 10 pixel
72:38 - and 0 and we will give it a
72:41 - border radius of look at this because
72:44 - this is going to be crazy
72:46 - so we will have a zero a 100 pixel a 100
72:50 - pixel and a zero this is top left top
72:53 - right
72:53 - bottom right and bottom left make sure
72:57 - to
72:57 - note it what's happening here okay
73:00 - because now i am only giving a border
73:02 - radius of the right hand
73:04 - side as you can see uh
73:07 - over here if i hover over only that side
73:10 - if i go all the way to the left it's not
73:13 - uh not border radius
73:17 - if it makes sense at all all right
73:20 - and in case we hover over the sidebar
73:24 - item
73:25 - we want to give it a shiny little tat
73:28 - this little tab of blackish something
73:32 - which is the which is a .04
73:36 - opacity black all right
73:43 - now next up we will have the sidebar
73:47 - item underscore arrow
73:52 - and we will give it a width of a 28
73:55 - pixels
73:56 - and a margin left of 12 pixels
74:01 - so that's dope and next up we will have
74:04 - the sidebar item
74:06 - and we will have a main which is going
74:09 - to be a display
74:11 - of flex and the text in there
74:15 - should be uh should have a margin
74:18 - left of 12 pixels so that will deliver
74:21 - the desired
74:22 - outcome hopefully
74:25 - okay we're not just there quite yet
74:29 - um but it is getting itself together
74:33 - okay
74:38 - okay what's happening in the chat by the
74:39 - way how old am i
74:42 - too old um
74:47 - okay so sidebar
74:53 - start presenting 15 pixels whatever we
74:56 - will just figure it out
74:58 - all right and
75:01 - yeah we imported it whatever whatever
75:05 - okay uh we will add a new file
75:08 - in here which is going to be the style
75:10 - for the new file item
75:12 - okay i didn't want that to be
75:15 - a javascript file it should have been a
75:18 - css that's it
75:20 - and that needs to be imported in the
75:24 - uh new file file
75:30 - uh so yeah right there and oh my god
75:41 - goes all the way oh over here okay
75:46 - uh yeah so new file.css
75:51 - is going to be a little bit uh
75:54 - tricky we will have all these stuff
75:57 - happening in here so we will have we
75:58 - will give it a display of flex and a
76:00 - line item
76:01 - of center padding of 12 pixels on bottom
76:04 - on
76:04 - above and below and zero pixels on the
76:07 - sides now the padding left
76:09 - actually needs to be 20 pixels i should
76:11 - have gone with the trouble
76:13 - uh method but i just went this way
76:16 - now the container is going to have a
76:18 - display of flux it will
76:21 - centralize all the stuff both vertically
76:24 - and horizontally so the justify content
76:27 - is responsible for the horizontal
76:29 - axis and the align item for the
76:32 - vertical axis now this here you can see
76:35 - the trouble which means
76:36 - top right bottom and left
76:41 - uh that's what happened here so the top
76:43 - six pixels
76:44 - right 32 pixels bottom six pixels again
76:48 - and the left is going to be eight pixels
76:50 - this is so this is a huge hack that you
76:52 - can learn
76:53 - and the border radius is going to be a
76:56 - 50 pixel now
76:57 - the box shadow i honestly
77:00 - grabbed it from somewhere online because
77:03 - uh
77:05 - i hate messing with box shadows but
77:08 - uh the box shadow is going to be zero
77:10 - one pixel two pixel zero rgb
77:12 - sixty sixty four sixty seven zero point
77:17 - and all the way this is something that
77:21 - you want to
77:22 - uh always generate with some sort of
77:26 - box shadow generator if you search it at
77:28 - google it will show it up
77:30 - and the text will have a margin left of
77:33 - 40 14
77:34 - pixels if it's bursting is bursting your
77:37 - eardrums make sure to
77:39 - lower the volume all right
77:42 - next up
77:45 - let me drink
77:57 - okay next up uh
78:07 - and now we actually have this nice
78:09 - little um
78:12 - button over here with the cursor pointer
78:15 - and all that kind of stuff so that's
78:16 - amazing
78:17 - now next up we would just pass in the
78:20 - you're good at rgb colors i was messing
78:22 - with those a lot
78:24 - those took me time i came prepared
78:28 - so uh we will just pass in all that file
78:31 - view that is coming
78:32 - in here and that's pretty much the main
78:36 - uh stuff that will happen
78:39 - in there so for that inside of the
78:42 - components we will add a new folder
78:43 - which we'll call which we will call
78:45 - files view and oh my god
78:50 - and for for that
78:54 - we will add a new file called files
78:57 - view dot js
79:00 - actually let me go ahead and close
79:04 - all these windows
79:09 - so i want to have the app.js and the
79:12 - files view
79:13 - the js open and nothing else
79:17 - so the files view is going to be a
79:20 - component again
79:22 - and i just want to add the class name of
79:26 - uh
79:29 - file view yes
79:32 - file view and it will have a row in
79:35 - there
79:38 - which is going to be containing all the
79:40 - file cards okay so if you remember
79:42 - on the top i will show it in just a bit
79:46 - we will have a ton of file cards okay
79:49 - file cards like that
79:52 - so if you if you take a look at this
79:56 - that's all those images
80:01 - now uh we will start with the list under
80:04 - it
80:06 - so yeah let's get that done first
80:10 - uh okay and coming in here we will have
80:14 - obviously the titles which is going to
80:16 - be file
80:17 - view titles
80:22 - and that we have a left and a
80:25 - right and we are going to be design we
80:27 - are going to be using
80:28 - almost the same css twice but don't
80:31 - worry uh
80:32 - this is just for just to make sure
80:34 - everything's looks
80:36 - cool so we will have a file view
80:39 - titles dash
80:42 - left because we are following the naming
80:45 - convention
80:46 - and inside of ap tag we will have the
80:48 - name
80:49 - now once again we will have the file
80:52 - view underscore titles dash dash right
80:57 - which is going to contain uh the last
81:00 - modified okay last mo
81:04 - find and the we will even calculate the
81:08 - file's size so that's something to keep
81:12 - in mind
81:13 - when it actually all these little stuff
81:16 - are going to give so much more value to
81:19 - your application
81:21 - and this
81:24 - is where all the file oops this is where
81:28 - all the file items will
81:30 - go all right so who is following me by
81:33 - the way who is
81:34 - here who is uh who is here with me
81:40 - okay
81:44 - revision okay all good uh
81:47 - so yeah we have a hundred and
81:51 - eighty five eight 159
81:55 - people watching right now i'm so
81:57 - thankful for you guys that is amazing
82:00 - that
82:00 - all of you guys are here so
82:04 - massive applause for you all right
82:07 - with that said let us let's continue i'm
82:10 - new here
82:10 - okay we see a few different guys who are
82:14 - here can someone explain what he is
82:17 - actually doing i'm new here
82:18 - i am building my friend the google drive
82:22 - clone this is how it will look like this
82:25 - is where we are at
82:26 - right now yes google drive with react.js
82:29 - yes uh just make sure come back to this
82:32 - video we will have a shorter version of
82:34 - it i will have the code down below so
82:35 - you will have
82:36 - all the resources that you want to uh
82:40 - have voice not clear sometimes that's
82:42 - because my own voice is dying
82:45 - all right so to
82:48 - actually have files that we can render
82:51 - out we
82:52 - need to make sure that we upload those
82:54 - files so
82:55 - going back to our new file.js
83:00 - uh what we want to do is actually first
83:04 - add a firebase
83:08 - urge.js file yeah and
83:10 - if you guys remember
83:14 - we had this snippet of code with all the
83:16 - stuff that was happening i hope this is
83:18 - the one
83:20 - because if it's not uh yeah 7
83:23 - 3 f o b yeah so make sure that you get
83:27 - the right
83:28 - uh api keys and all that stuff uh that
83:31 - you would need
83:33 - for this project because
83:36 - that's where we will be saving all our
83:39 - files so
83:40 - but before we can actually uh do that
83:44 - we need to add a few different stuff and
83:47 - one of them being
83:48 - firebase and the firebase
83:51 - tools so these are actually two npm
83:54 - packages that we are using to interact
83:57 - between
83:58 - firebase and our application so that's
84:00 - something amazing to
84:02 - have and it is actually a bit of a
84:05 - hustle
84:06 - to set up but once it's done it's done
84:10 - for all and we will be doing
84:13 - a a few different stuff in here
84:16 - one of them is going to be actually
84:18 - creating the app
84:19 - uh instance which is going to be a
84:21 - firebase app and it's going to be an
84:23 - initializer and which is going to throw
84:25 - in the firebase config
84:26 - and then we will uh create an
84:29 - authentication
84:30 - service which is going to be using the
84:33 - firebase.auth
84:34 - um
84:37 - [Music]
84:39 - service and we will just use that api
84:42 - then we will have a const uh
84:46 - that will be the provider because we are
84:49 - guys
84:50 - we are actually gonna be using google
84:52 - sign in so that's
84:54 - you might you might be thinking that's
84:56 - like a total trip to
84:58 - uh create but it's actually super easy
85:01 - to set up so we will say
85:03 - uh five is that auth dot google
85:07 - earth provider
85:11 - and that's it and we will have two more
85:13 - things one of them
85:14 - is going to be the storage and the other
85:17 - one is going to be
85:18 - the fire store so those are the two
85:21 - things that we will need and then we
85:24 - just
85:25 - go ahead and export everything auth
85:27 - provider db and storage
85:30 - so that's pretty much setting up
85:33 - firebase
85:34 - oh my god my whistle is low whatever
85:39 - so going back to the new file that's
85:42 - when we will actually start using
85:44 - all this so to make sure
85:48 - everything works we will need to uh
85:51 - import firebase from firebase and
85:53 - storage and db
85:54 - from the file that we just
85:58 - uh that we just created
86:03 - now hey robot
86:06 - robot is thought yeah
86:12 - we will do a few different stuff here we
86:14 - will need to set up
86:16 - a model that will just pop up and we'll
86:18 - have two buttons
86:20 - and then we will make sure that uh
86:25 - and we will make sure that that will be
86:27 - responsible for
86:29 - our uploading processes so for that
86:33 - uh we have these things happening uh
86:36 - we will import the make styles
86:40 - and the model from material ui once
86:43 - again
86:44 - future we're coming from extension
86:45 - themes yes
86:48 - and we will actually i actually went
86:50 - ahead and
86:51 - uh researched all these settings
86:55 - right so everything in here
86:58 - is actually coming from google
87:01 - uh the material ui documentation you can
87:04 - go ahead and search up materia ui
87:06 - models and this is what it will show
87:10 - okay so this is how you set it up and we
87:14 - just need to add a few different stuff
87:16 - in here so to make sure that everything
87:19 - is
87:19 - aligned and in place so
87:22 - this is kind of like getting uh getting
87:26 - towards the style components ish thing
87:29 - and yeah now for next up
87:33 - uh we will need once again this is all
87:36 - coming from material ui
87:38 - you guys can go ahead and basically copy
87:41 - all this stuff
87:43 - so uh we will have these classes which
87:45 - is going to be using
87:46 - these uh styles that we just defined we
87:49 - will just throw it
87:50 - into the model and
87:53 - the model style will be uh
87:57 - updated with get mo with this get model
87:59 - fi and we will
88:00 - set up a few different uh use
88:03 - states from uh react
88:06 - so that's something to keep in mind
88:11 - so we will need to definitely import
88:12 - those stuff
88:14 - and now this is where we will go ahead
88:17 - and
88:17 - upload everything okay
88:20 - so in order for uh for us to have
88:24 - this model thing uh this is once again
88:28 - copied from all the way from materia ui
88:32 - uh going over here and just pasting it
88:35 - in here so we will have a model which is
88:38 - going to be open
88:39 - once uh this state
88:43 - is actually set to true okay now the on
88:46 - close will actually fire
88:48 - off a handle close um
88:52 - function we haven't declared it yet no
88:54 - problem
88:55 - and we have some seo stuff in here going
88:57 - on
88:58 - and we have a div in there which
89:02 - we'll need to use the model style that
89:04 - we
89:05 - just uh
89:08 - defined here and that's going to be
89:11 - once again coming from google
89:15 - and now once we are actually
89:18 - uploading this is something that we will
89:21 - set up
89:22 - then we just we don't want anything to
89:24 - show up
89:26 - uh we don't want anything to show up but
89:30 - an uploading sign if it's not the case
89:32 - then we want to have
89:33 - two inputs one of them is a file
89:37 - that will be responsible for uh
89:40 - selecting
89:40 - those files that we want to upload and
89:44 - a button okay so those are the two
89:46 - things that we will have in there
89:48 - and that's pretty much it for the upload
89:52 - part for now now we will have to make
89:56 - sure that
89:57 - uh that model opens and closes as
90:00 - we need them to do so
90:04 - we will have these two functions over
90:06 - here and once we
90:07 - hit the handle open which is actually
90:10 - going to be
90:11 - um triggered
90:14 - once we hit the button so we need to add
90:17 - this
90:18 - in oops not there
90:24 - not even there there
90:29 - oh hold on so
90:33 - once we hit that button we want this
90:36 - model to be open that's when we will
90:38 - just fire it off
90:39 - it will turn this on and then the model
90:42 - pops up
90:43 - once we click out of it it will we want
90:45 - that to be actually closed so we will
90:47 - just say set open
90:48 - equals false confusing a little bit
90:51 - uh just make sure to watch it a few
90:54 - different times
90:55 - and then you will understand it and it's
90:58 - all the wraps i will have the code down
91:00 - below a shorter version up by
91:03 - tomorrow the latest and then you can go
91:05 - ahead and
91:06 - understand everything now we will
91:09 - actually
91:10 - okay so once we have uh our
91:13 - file selected we will make sure that
91:16 - this handle change runs okay
91:19 - so that handle change
91:23 - where is it uh here we are
91:26 - so that uh const handle change
91:30 - will actually be important
91:33 - uh so that uh we make sure that our file
91:36 - is selected now
91:37 - if yes
91:41 - e dot target dot files
91:45 - equal and the first item so zero okay
91:49 - uh so if we have that file we want that
91:52 - to be
91:52 - set to uh inside of this specific use
91:56 - data we just
91:57 - declared up top
92:01 - now and that's that's what we would just
92:04 - throw in there so we will just say
92:06 - either target.files
92:08 - zero now this is
92:11 - not uploading the file just yet but
92:14 - we have it inside of our application so
92:16 - once we click
92:17 - upload it will start the process
92:21 - so if we go down here and we see this
92:23 - button
92:24 - which is uh going to fire of this handle
92:27 - upload function that's what will
92:31 - make sure that our our files are getting
92:34 - uploaded
92:35 - so const handle upload
92:45 - then we will set the uploading process
92:48 - to true right
92:52 - so that's when actually uh this is going
92:55 - to kick in
92:56 - and we will just have the uploading uh
92:59 - text showing up
93:03 - and with that because we already
93:07 - declare this storage we want to have
93:09 - this storage
93:10 - the reference and inside of there we
93:13 - will have the files folder
93:15 - and in there we want to create a file
93:18 - which is going to use the file name that
93:20 - we just uploaded
93:22 - okay hope it makes sense and that's
93:24 - where we want to
93:25 - put our file but
93:28 - once that's done we will actually wait
93:30 - for it to
93:31 - get done we will have a snapshot
93:36 - yep and once that's done um we can just
93:39 - go ahead and console log it
93:43 - which is good snap shot
93:48 - yes
93:50 - then we will say storage the reference
93:55 - and inside of the files we want to grab
93:57 - the download url so that way you just
94:00 - you're not just uploading files you can
94:02 - actually download them
94:04 - now the file uh
94:08 - child is going to be yeah so
94:11 - in here we will say file name and
94:14 - get download uh url
94:18 - why isn't it
94:24 - yep so that's the fi okay so
94:27 - right now what we're doing is we are
94:29 - looking into that specific
94:31 - file that we just uploaded and we
94:33 - grabbed the download url and once we
94:35 - have that then we want that
94:38 - to be saved into our no sql database
94:42 - okay
94:43 - so we will just say db.collection
94:48 - collection
94:53 - and we would just create a my files
94:55 - folder in there or
94:57 - actually collection yeah and we will say
95:00 - add
95:01 - and we will add a timestamp
95:06 - which is going to be the
95:08 - firebase.firestore
95:11 - firestore dot field value
95:16 - dot server timestamp so that way
95:19 - if i have a specific time
95:22 - i don't know so it is 1 18
95:26 - p.m in los angeles time but say
95:29 - somebody i'm working with somebody from
95:30 - stockholm uh
95:32 - their time is past 10 p.m
95:35 - i think it's 10 80 uh p.m
95:39 - what's up everybody who's joining now uh
95:41 - we are building
95:42 - the google drive clone using firebase
95:45 - and react
95:48 - so we will see uh the time
95:52 - according to our time zone so
95:55 - once that's cool
95:59 - uh once that's done we want to add a
96:02 - caption
96:03 - which will be the file.name we don't
96:10 - want to forget those commas
96:13 - and then we will have a file url that's
96:15 - actually
96:16 - what we got in the first place
96:23 - and we will want to save the size of the
96:26 - file which is going to be snapshot
96:29 - dot underscore delegate
96:33 - dot bytes transferred
96:38 - this is actually the little details that
96:41 - make all the difference especially on a
96:43 - coding interview or something like that
96:45 - so make sure
96:46 - to understand what's happening here it
96:50 - might take a little bit of time for you
96:53 - to
96:53 - understand and memorize everything but
96:56 - uh once you get the code make sure to
96:59 - take a look at
97:00 - every single piece what's happening
97:04 - uh yes it's capturing good catch
97:08 - thank you okay so now we should be able
97:11 - to
97:11 - upload files to firebase okay something
97:16 - is up all right
97:19 - uh so
97:22 - sidebar has some issues and firebase
97:26 - the js has some issues okay in here i
97:29 - forgot to import
97:30 - firebase
97:33 - from firebase yes
97:38 - and files in the new file
97:43 - which liner code 57
97:56 - oh yeah like that okay so because we are
98:00 - just only putting the one file
98:02 - in there okay now i got it
98:05 - okay
98:10 - still freaking out yes because i
98:14 - screwed screwed it up there too
98:17 - one file dope all right
98:20 - things are getting together now we have
98:22 - some sort of functionality coming up
98:24 - here we can select whatever file we want
98:27 - to upload there
98:28 - but since it's not uh showing no
98:31 - it wouldn't show up i am not uh doing
98:34 - actually let's do that
98:36 - actually let's do that okay so i have
98:38 - this uh
98:40 - parrot image over here i'm just gonna go
98:42 - ahead and hit
98:44 - up uh i hit escape
98:49 - i'm just going to go ahead select that
98:50 - and choose for upload and then go ahead
98:52 - and
98:53 - upload it
98:56 - user doesn't have permission to access
98:58 - files parrots whatever
99:02 - let's take a look at what's going on so
99:03 - if i go into storage
99:05 - i might haven't started that
99:08 - um okay let's take a look at what's
99:12 - going on
99:13 - in here as well
99:16 - we have the storage happening that's
99:19 - good
99:21 - uh storage unauthorized yep
99:26 - choose file select
99:29 - guys this is debugging mode
99:33 - what's up venezuela
99:38 - okay
99:41 - user does not have permission to access
99:49 - let's take a look at what's happening in
99:52 - here
100:09 - okay let's take a look at what's up okay
100:11 - can we take up the likes
100:12 - up to 300 let me debug it first okay
100:16 - okay uh
100:19 - might be the firebase project that has
100:21 - issues by the way
100:23 - it's a web app boom let's take a look at
100:27 - what's going on
100:28 - let's let's debug this
100:35 - i think you have to edit the rules in
100:36 - firebase storage uh
100:39 - could be actually it shouldn't be a
100:41 - problem by the way
100:43 - but yeah let's take a look at that
100:48 - oh yeah haha good catch
100:52 - somebody give this guy
100:56 - [Applause]
100:57 - give this guy a medal he just figured it
100:59 - out yeah i forgot it
101:01 - so if you see the same error no problem
101:05 - because
101:05 - our user is not authenticated
101:09 - uh fiber is just not gonna let us
101:12 - uh import add files in there
101:15 - so to actually fix that problem
101:19 - or not that much of a problem because
101:20 - it's secure uh you're just gonna go
101:22 - ahead and delete everything
101:24 - uh behind right add a semicolon
101:29 - and just gonna go hit publish
101:32 - and now we should be good to go so if i
101:35 - go ahead do the same thing
101:37 - once again uh add this
101:40 - file upload let's see what's happening
101:48 - let's go it's uploaded okay let's take a
101:51 - look at inside of our
101:54 - uh storage as well yes files
101:59 - and here we go this is our file that we
102:01 - just uploaded
102:02 - dope that that's a good catch thanks bro
102:06 - massive shout out to sammy
102:09 - rizvan for this amazing catch
102:12 - all right we and we also we have all the
102:16 - stuff happening in here inside of our
102:18 - fire store and guys we are not
102:20 - too much far behind of schedule so let's
102:24 - continue
102:27 - all right so new file is
102:30 - done going to file views
102:37 - okay uh going to file views yes
102:41 - and what we would do here is
102:44 - once we actually load up this uh
102:48 - file let me just put this snippet of
102:50 - code in here
102:51 - so first thing first we will need to
102:53 - define a use state which we
102:55 - obviously import from react
102:59 - let's do that
103:02 - so we import use state we import useful
103:04 - because we are going to be using
103:06 - both of those uh
103:10 - yep so first thing first we will create
103:13 - a
103:13 - use state and once we are cool with that
103:18 - then what we will do is we will uh start
103:20 - a use effect which we are going to our
103:22 - database into our collections into
103:24 - inside of my files
103:26 - create a snapshot and then just uh give
103:30 - that thing a value so the snapshot.map
103:34 - and inside of every single doc will be
103:36 - destructured to
103:39 - id and item so these things
103:42 - are what that uh document is going to be
103:46 - made
103:47 - up of and if you take a look at this
103:50 - this is uh the doc.data
103:54 - and this is the doc.id so that's just
103:57 - something to keep in mind
103:59 - but for that to actually work we will
104:02 - need to
104:03 - import the db from firebase which is
104:06 - cool
104:07 - so now we are so now that we are done
104:09 - with that part
104:11 - what we need to do what's up crisby
104:14 - uh what we need to do now is
104:18 - we were just going to go ahead and list
104:20 - out all the
104:21 - uh files that we have so we will create
104:24 - a new file which we will call
104:26 - uh file
104:29 - without caps lock file item dot
104:32 - js boom and aria ce
104:36 - that's it and we will just add a class
104:38 - name
104:39 - of file item
104:43 - like that now
104:46 - for that we will do a a
104:49 - few different things first thing first
104:52 - and
104:53 - most importantly what we will do is
104:59 - add in all these stuff
105:06 - [Music]
105:10 - we will add in all these stuff now okay
105:12 - what's happening here
105:14 - so first off we will import a insert
105:16 - drive
105:17 - file icon which is going to be the file
105:21 - icon actually then we will have all
105:24 - these months
105:25 - and that will help us determine what is
105:28 - the actual date that we uh
105:31 - created our file
105:34 - then uh this is going to be the
105:38 - uh
105:41 - the specific file item which will grab
105:43 - an id
105:44 - a caption a timestamp a file url and the
105:47 - size
105:48 - so basically we are rotating all the
105:50 - stuff in here
105:51 - that we saved our into our database
105:54 - right
105:55 - now first off we will create a file date
105:58 - which is going to be
105:59 - a day a month three letter month
106:03 - and a year so for
106:06 - that we will use the timestamp
106:10 - if it exists and then uh
106:14 - we will transfer it to date and then
106:16 - grab the date out of it which is
106:18 - actually
106:19 - the day then we will grab the month
106:22 - names
106:23 - up one here and we will do the same
106:26 - but we will uh be getting the month and
106:29 - we will add plus
106:30 - one uh
106:35 - i'm not even sure why we did one let
106:38 - let's take a look at that uh
106:40 - okay and next up we will have the
106:42 - timestamp the two date and we will grab
106:44 - the year out of it now
106:48 - this is actually a snippet of code that
106:50 - i
106:51 - copied from stack overflow which pretty
106:53 - much just
106:55 - grabs a grabs a number
106:58 - and turns it into a readable file
107:01 - size string so what that means is
107:04 - instead of uh instead of seeing
107:09 - a bunch of numbers which we see over
107:11 - here
107:12 - we will see 17 something megabytes or
107:15 - something
107:16 - or maybe even 1.7 megabytes we will see
107:19 - we will see
107:20 - it will turn it into a nicely and easily
107:23 - readable format so if you go into here
107:26 - you see 1.6 megabytes
107:28 - to 46.7 kilobytes so that's what we want
107:32 - to
107:34 - do now
107:36 - uh so we are cool
107:40 - there uh yes we removed this part
107:44 - okay so these are the parts that i
107:46 - actually copied from stack overflow
107:48 - this is uh pretty much available to
107:50 - anybody who wants to go and grab these
107:52 - but i highly recommend either checking
107:55 - out the git repo down below
107:56 - or actually we'll be down below a day
107:59 - or two more or uh just
108:03 - copying it from the screen but with that
108:07 - said i'm just gonna go ahead and
108:09 - continue now
108:12 - next up uh which editor am i using vs
108:16 - code
108:17 - next up what i will do is i'm just going
108:19 - to create an
108:20 - a and the href is what's up amano
108:24 - let's go five dollar donation
108:28 - let's go let's get in
108:32 - all right let's continue
108:38 - amazing amanda is such a cool dude
108:42 - all right so the href is going to be the
108:44 - file url so
108:46 - basically once we click the file it will
108:49 - open it up in
108:50 - a new tab because we set the target to
108:54 - uh underscore blank
108:57 - like that and
109:00 - we just want to make sure that it's a
109:03 - downloadable
109:04 - file so we just add that tag there and
109:07 - that's cool
109:07 - now we will have inside of here a few
109:10 - different things
109:12 - um one of them being is
109:15 - the file item left that's going to
109:17 - contain the icon
109:19 - we just that we just imported up over
109:22 - here and the caption that we are passing
109:25 - in here
109:26 - now we are not passing in it just yet
109:29 - but we are catching it before
109:32 - i had to use my vpn for that oh
109:36 - wow that's what happens when the nothing
109:38 - is available in your region i know that
109:41 - all right next up we have the file item
109:44 - right that will contain the file date
109:47 - that we just structured
109:48 - up over here with a bunch of template
109:52 - literals and all that stuff
109:53 - and then we will make sure that the
109:56 - readable file size string is there too
110:00 - so that being said
110:05 - we pretty much have a row of files let's
110:08 - take a look at how it looks like and
110:09 - it's going to freak out because we
110:11 - haven't
110:11 - uh haven't actually added it yet
110:15 - so that's good so now moving back to
110:18 - file views
110:20 - fileview.js we will need to loop
110:24 - through all the files that we just
110:26 - downloaded
110:27 - from firebase over here in the use
110:30 - effect
110:33 - so for that to happen we are just going
110:35 - to say
110:36 - files dot map and
110:40 - we would destructure the file right away
110:44 - and we will obviously have the id and
110:47 - the item
110:48 - inside there so that's good and we will
110:51 - just
110:52 - add in a new file item so we import it
110:55 - right away uh no we haven't imported it
110:59 - right away so this problem
111:04 - uh
111:06 - so i'm just going to go ahead and import
111:08 - the file item from the same folder which
111:10 - is going
111:10 - yeah file item just like that
111:14 - and i want to go ahead and
111:18 - throw in the id as the id
111:21 - right then we will have the caption
111:24 - which is going to be item dot caption
111:30 - so we what we are basically doing here
111:32 - is just uh
111:35 - scrubbing through the whole
111:39 - uh entry of the database and then just
111:42 - each and every single little thing is
111:45 - going to be passed into
111:47 - that file item item
111:50 - component so let's take a look at how it
111:53 - looks like
111:54 - right now and
111:57 - still not amazing
112:01 - so something is still up
112:06 - let's take a look at what we got here
112:08 - i'm not sure if i
112:09 - oh yeah no i haven't edited it in here
112:12 - either
112:13 - so we're just gonna say file view boom
112:17 - and let's see if now it works
112:21 - okay files view is not defined
112:24 - not a problem
112:34 - oh yeah so for that uh we definitely
112:38 - need to import that part
112:39 - as well uh and that is going to be
112:43 - imported from exactly here what's up
112:46 - derek
112:47 - high five bro let's take a look at how
112:50 - it looks like
112:51 - right now
112:57 - and resolve uh file item dot
113:00 - js
113:04 - all right we're just gonna do a little
113:06 - bit of debugging here because something
113:08 - apparently is up
113:12 - okay file items css i think i haven't
113:15 - made that just yet uh but i imported it
113:18 - already
113:19 - so let's take a look at that part
113:24 - all right so everything is getting under
113:27 - it so
113:28 - we just need to fix something up here
113:31 - we will need to add a display flex so
113:34 - for
113:35 - that uh we will be going into
113:38 - app.css
113:41 - what can i learn here guys you can learn
113:44 - here how to build a google drive
113:48 - so what we will do here
113:51 - is the app.main needs to have a display
113:55 - flex
113:56 - so we're just going to go into over here
113:58 - and just add it in here
114:00 - path is wrong nope it's not and now it
114:02 - should be actually i haven't made that
114:04 - file just yet so yeah path is wrong but
114:06 - yeah okay let's take a look at how we
114:09 - look like
114:10 - right now still not good uh and that's
114:13 - because
114:14 - we need to create the structure of
114:17 - the app file
114:20 - so uh how does it look like
114:25 - we will need to add in a uh
114:28 - new div in here and guys
114:32 - don't freak out like this is uh
114:35 - this is literally how it's done it's
114:38 - okay to run into errors it's completely
114:40 - fine
114:41 - just fixing it up so uh what happens
114:44 - here is we have the header on the top
114:46 - right
114:47 - and all these things are only going to
114:49 - appear
114:50 - once we authorize the user or we sign
114:54 - in actually and we want to differentiate
114:57 - this from the header because otherwise
114:59 - everything would be next to each other
115:01 - but we want the header to be on the top
115:03 - and whatever comes after
115:04 - is next to be each other okay we will
115:07 - have three
115:08 - different three different components
115:09 - coming in there
115:11 - and out of the out of those three we
115:13 - have already done
115:16 - two
115:18 - so yes uh we are in that case we are
115:21 - pretty good there
115:24 - let's refresh and now we have
115:27 - all these things happening so that is
115:29 - going to be the title over there
115:31 - title right above the uh
115:34 - line okay and we will have the file name
115:38 - and the
115:39 - all the stuff and notice that we see the
115:42 - app class name note following bam yep
115:45 - just
115:46 - yet it's not but i'm just gonna fix that
115:48 - real quick
115:50 - so we see that we have 1.6 megabytes of
115:53 - file happening there okay
115:57 - so that is good
116:02 - all right uh
116:07 - what we are gonna do now is make sure
116:10 - that
116:10 - all these things look nice and then add
116:14 - two more things and we are cool okay so
116:17 - we are done with the file item now we
116:19 - need to add in
116:20 - a file item that css file which i
116:23 - actually
116:24 - uh didn't do last time but now it is
116:26 - time so
116:28 - file item css
116:32 - guys if this is confusing that is 100
116:36 - okay uh that is because
116:40 - i'm going a little bit uh in to
116:43 - several places but
116:46 - please please make sure to come back
116:49 - check this video
116:50 - once again and check out the
116:54 - github repo down below in the
116:55 - description and i promise that
116:56 - everything is going to be cleared
116:58 - out 100 all right going back
117:02 - into the code uh we have we are going to
117:06 - target the file item
117:08 - which is going to have a height oops
117:12 - we which is going to have a height of
117:15 - 55 pixels and a border bottom
117:18 - of one pixel solid and the rgb
117:22 - of 219
117:31 - 219 and 219. all right
117:34 - we will do the exact same thing for the
117:38 - border
117:38 - top as well and we will have
117:42 - a width of a 100 percent
117:46 - all right
117:50 - so one little maintenance thing over
117:53 - here
117:55 - is what i'm gonna do is wait a
117:58 - just a little bit
118:03 - so one second let me just load all this
118:08 - stuff
118:18 - all right
118:54 - whatever all right so uh
118:58 - the width is going to be 100 and so that
119:01 - makes sure
119:02 - that the whole file is actually going
119:04 - all the way so the file item is
119:06 - using all the space that it can
119:09 - so the file item a uh so we want to
119:13 - remove
119:13 - all that ugliness happening so we just
119:16 - want that
119:17 - to have a 100 of height
119:21 - and we want that to have a display of
119:24 - flux
119:26 - as well as the text decoration
119:29 - of none
119:34 - i will go through the css preprocessors
119:37 - in another video okay
119:40 - so the text decoration is going to be
119:42 - none and we will set the color to this
119:44 - nice little rgb 85
119:47 - 78 and 78 that will be a grayish
119:52 - something so to make sure that
119:55 - uh the colors inside of
119:58 - it's actually making sure that that file
120:01 - is
120:02 - looking good so
120:06 - with that uh next up we're moving on
120:10 - to the div inside of there
120:15 - uh we actually want to go ahead and
120:17 - import all this file
120:19 - and with that done we are good
120:29 - all right so the file item uh
120:33 - yeah okay so inside of the file item
120:37 - the link and we will just uh
120:42 - target all the divs inside of that link
120:45 - and we will select display we will make
120:48 - sure that
120:49 - everything is next to each other so we
120:52 - will say display of
120:54 - flux and we will give it an align items
120:57 - of
120:57 - center so everything is vertically
121:00 - aligned
121:03 - uh let me just do a few different things
121:05 - over here
121:08 - yeah right there dope
121:12 - and now we want to actually uh target
121:15 - all the
121:16 - uh child items of that of those divs so
121:19 - we will say
121:20 - file item dot a
121:24 - a and div and inside of there there is
121:27 - gonna be a star
121:28 - so that actually makes sure that all the
121:31 - items
121:32 - inside of those uh
121:35 - so these basically these two
121:38 - are going to be targeted and those are
121:41 - going to
121:42 - have a margin of 10
121:45 - pixels right now the file item
121:50 - uh dash dash right
121:53 - actually left is going to be a flex
121:57 - it's going to have a flex of one and we
122:00 - actually should have a nicely looking
122:03 - uh file item over here now we obviously
122:08 - need to
122:08 - stretch the whole thing out all the way
122:13 - [Music]
122:16 - uh
122:24 - yeah we will have to stretch out the
122:25 - whole thing all the way
122:27 - but once we are done with that uh we
122:29 - will be good so
122:30 - for that to happen we get we need to go
122:33 - back to the file item
122:34 - nope the files view uh that css file
122:38 - which we haven't actually created
122:40 - just yet
122:44 - and
122:51 - okay hold on a second
122:57 - all right dope
123:10 - all right so each and every single
123:11 - individual items are now looking good
123:14 - okay
123:14 - i kind of lost my chain of thought uh
123:17 - and we'll just
123:18 - close this yep dope okay so now we're
123:20 - back on track we can
123:22 - uh finish this off strong in a little
123:24 - bit and what we will do
123:25 - is we will go in the styles and create a
123:29 - files view um
123:33 - files view the css file
123:38 - jeez let's see us
123:41 - come on
123:46 - and what we will do is we will obviously
123:49 - import that
123:50 - inside of files view so
123:53 - to make sure that everything is looking
123:56 - clean
123:58 - and for that what we will say in there
124:01 - is we will make sure that the whole
124:04 - thing
124:05 - is uh stretched to
124:08 - the all the way so it will use one
124:10 - hundred percent
124:12 - then we will target the row
124:15 - which is going to be which i think uh
124:18 - we will need to add two underscores
124:22 - so file view i'm just gonna underscore
124:26 - row
124:27 - and inside of there we will add a height
124:30 - of 250 pixels we will add a display of
124:33 - flex
124:34 - and then align item of center so
124:38 - everything is going to be ver
124:39 - vertically aligned to the center
124:43 - now the file view
124:47 - file view underscore underscore titles
124:55 - it is going to be a display of flux
124:59 - then a margin bottom of 5 pixels
125:04 - then we will have set the color of it
125:07 - to prgb and we will set it to 85
125:12 - then 78 and 78
125:16 - next up we will be targeting all the um
125:22 - uh for the titles and we will make sure
125:24 - that everything
125:25 - is aligned and all in place so
125:28 - we should be looking at something
125:32 - like this if there wasn't some sort of
125:35 - issue uh
125:38 - files view title
125:45 - let's take a look at uh tight tools
125:55 - let's take a look at what we have here
125:57 - once again
125:59 - uh there's some sort of typo happening
126:14 - here
126:42 - you make sure make sure to check the
126:45 - typos and all those stuff because that's
126:48 - where
126:48 - my whole uh styling is going crazy right
126:52 - now
126:53 - um because i have these
126:58 - because they have these uh typing issues
127:02 - so we will have file view titles left
127:06 - [Music]
127:09 - okay so sometimes there is the s
127:11 - sometimes i forgot it so
127:14 - make sure to yeah okay now we are good
127:17 - it's all the way stretched and all
127:18 - okay now everything is looking all nice
127:21 - and clean
127:22 - we are getting this together we will
127:23 - finish this off strong and now
127:26 - with that part done we will be okay so
127:29 - this is uh
127:30 - working perfect we will be adding those
127:33 - cards in here the items in here and the
127:36 - authentication and we should be done
127:38 - in less than 20 minutes
127:41 - so with that done uh we will close up
127:44 - all these
127:45 - uh little things and we will just go
127:48 - in here and add the file card
127:52 - so the file card is going to be a new
127:54 - file
127:55 - a new component so file card
127:58 - dot c j
128:01 - j s we will just type in rafc
128:05 - just like always to create a new
128:07 - component so that will be a class name
128:10 - of what is it file card
128:15 - and it will have a top
128:19 - which will have the usual icon
128:22 - that we use throughout the application
128:25 - from materia ui so that's actually
128:28 - something
128:29 - uh to make sure to save it
128:32 - and to have it somewhere okay uh
128:48 - okay uh
128:51 - dope
128:55 - so with that that with that said uh we
128:57 - will have
128:58 - an other uh div which is going to be the
129:02 - bottom of that file card and
129:05 - for that to work we will need to pass in
129:08 - a we will need to pass in the name
129:11 - of the file now to actually for that to
129:16 - happen
129:18 - we would need to uh be looping through
129:21 - the whole thing but
129:22 - we don't want it to be cluttered all the
129:24 - way so we would just
129:25 - uh render out five of those
129:28 - so we will be going back to the files
129:30 - view and this is where we
129:32 - import the file cards file
129:35 - okay so for that to happen
129:39 - uh for that to happen
129:43 - we would just go in and import
129:47 - so notice that this is the file that i
129:49 - just created over here
129:52 - and for that to actually function uh
129:55 - we will be slicing it up
129:59 - slicing the array up so what happens
130:01 - here
130:02 - so we will say files dot slice and we
130:05 - just want to grab out the
130:07 - the first item all the way to the fifth
130:09 - item but nothing else
130:11 - right so if there is 10 items we will
130:14 - just see the first five
130:15 - and the reason for that is we don't want
130:17 - the whole row to be
130:19 - full with those uh
130:22 - with those top so we will just say and
130:24 - we will just map
130:26 - those and we will say
130:29 - id and item because we destructure it
130:32 - right away and
130:36 - new arrow function and we will just have
130:38 - the file card
130:40 - and we will throw in the name
130:44 - so we will say item dot caption
130:50 - all right that should be it but
130:53 - uh because we are actually adding jsx
130:57 - we are not using squiggly braces we are
130:59 - using the normals
131:02 - okay now it's still freaking oh yeah you
131:05 - need to
131:05 - close the hair close the jsx tag so
131:08 - that's something to
131:09 - keep in mind all right
131:13 - uh let's take a look at how we look like
131:17 - right now
131:22 - yeah that could and we made it super
131:25 - big so right now
131:29 - um we will be importing the css to that
131:33 - specific file card file
131:37 - and we need to go ahead and create that
131:39 - real quick
131:41 - so which is going to be file card dot
131:44 - css
131:45 - boom and card
131:49 - css now this thing
131:52 - i actually copied the whole thing from
131:55 - uh
131:56 - google drive so the best way to
131:59 - clone applications is actually go there
132:02 - and then just uh
132:03 - grab out the css so they have those
132:06 - things uh they are 190 uh
132:10 - 190 high width of 2
132:14 - 40 pixels they will have
132:17 - a border radius of 10 pixels
132:21 - and they will have a border of one pixel
132:26 - one pixel solid and an rgb
132:29 - of 219 219. hello
132:34 - and 219
132:37 - and we will have a margin of
132:40 - 5 pixels obviously over there
132:44 - so that it actually can breathe a little
132:47 - now
132:48 - this is actually as uh as we just built
132:51 - it
132:52 - it is actually built up uh in two things
132:54 - the one of them is the filed card top
132:57 - it will have a height of 70 70 percent a
133:00 - bottom border of one pixel solid
133:02 - 290 with this almost white but still
133:06 - gray
133:07 - color we will give it a display flex and
133:09 - justify and align everything to the
133:11 - center so basically we stack it
133:12 - in the middle of that part now
133:16 - below that we have the file card bottom
133:19 - which will have a display of flex
133:21 - and align item center justify center
133:24 - width of 100
133:25 - and height over 30 percent
133:28 - so that's once again uh
133:32 - we just put the text in the middle
133:35 - now the max width of that uh text
133:39 - should be 90 pixels of its parent
133:42 - container and we will
133:44 - hide the overflow and make sure the text
133:46 - doesn't
133:47 - wrap because that's not how google drive
133:49 - works so this
133:51 - is how it is working and guys
133:54 - two more things left to do side icons on
133:57 - the
133:58 - right hand side and the authentication
134:00 - and we are
134:01 - good so let's do the side icons right
134:05 - now so what we will say
134:09 - is we will definitely need a new
134:16 - folder yes
134:21 - we will need to have a new folder so
134:23 - it's going to be side icons
134:25 - and inside of there we will have an
134:27 - index
134:28 - dot js file and
134:35 - we will create the component just like
134:38 - every single time and in here
134:42 - um i've actually made a i actually made
134:46 - a few google searches and searched up
134:48 - the top three applications that come up
134:51 - for me
134:52 - in my personal google drive i'm
134:54 - obviously not going to show it
134:56 - um so yeah though those are for me the
134:59 - google calendar the keep and the google
135:02 - tasks
135:04 - so for that what's up pranay so for that
135:06 - to work we will need
135:09 - to uh add
135:12 - these images now i highly highly
135:15 - recommend everybody goes ahead
135:17 - opens up a new tab and just type in
135:19 - google
135:21 - colon dar icon
135:24 - hit return and
135:27 - i don't know just grab one of those and
135:30 - then
135:32 - right click copy immediate address and
135:35 - then just paste it in there
135:36 - so that's literally how i've done it uh
135:39 - check out
135:40 - which one is on the top for you
135:44 - i have google keep google calendar and
135:46 - google tasks
135:49 - so those are the icons that i have
135:53 - i just went ahead did the thing that i
135:56 - just showed and then
135:57 - make sure to add the alt text for
136:00 - seo purposes
136:04 - now these are actually going to be on
136:05 - the top of the side
136:08 - uh icons so these
136:11 - uh we will create a new a div there
136:16 - and we will just wrap it around there
136:18 - now we will have
136:19 - a horizontal line in there as well
136:25 - and we will need an add icon
136:28 - down below because that's how it looks
136:31 - like
136:33 - which is going to be obviously a plus
136:35 - icon we just imported
136:36 - from the good old material ui
136:40 - and then we create the css file
136:44 - and make sure it looks all aligned and
136:46 - nice and perfect
136:48 - so we will create side icons dot css
136:53 - what's up partharoa how you doing bro
136:57 - what's good my man this guy actually
136:59 - crushes it
137:00 - he is a part he is the part of our uh
137:03 - chorus prophet jaws and he smashes that
137:07 - just like the like button right so
137:10 - [Music]
137:13 - now we are good on that side and what we
137:16 - will do now is we will just say
137:18 - dot side icons
137:22 - and these will have a width of a 50
137:24 - pixels
137:26 - a display of flux
137:30 - flex direction of column and
137:33 - aligning the items to the center
137:37 - and we will have a border left of one
137:40 - pixel solid and the rgb
137:44 - 219 219 219.
137:48 - the usual ones
137:51 - i'm doing amazing i'm doing fantastic
137:54 - during this live stream we are
137:58 - live for more than two hours and more
138:00 - than 100 people
138:02 - are here so that's amazing that's
138:03 - amazing guys 10 more minutes and we will
138:06 - be done
138:07 - so uh
138:12 - what do you mean align items doesn't
138:13 - work it does work
138:15 - align items works vertically
138:18 - okay and only works if there is a
138:21 - display flex before that but
138:23 - since here we have the flex direction
138:26 - the column
138:28 - it's going to be uh horizontal but the
138:32 - flex is always
138:34 - yeah you see what i mean i kind of hope
138:37 - so
138:38 - so the side icons we will have a width
138:40 - of 100 a display of flex
138:42 - flex deduction column and align items to
138:44 - center
138:47 - and we will have we will target all
138:50 - those images inside of there they will
138:52 - be objects that contain
138:53 - with over 30 pixels and a margin of
138:56 - 10 pixel uh above and below and zero
138:59 - on the sides now we would want to target
139:04 - that uh
139:05 - hr tag and give it a margin of 12 pixels
139:09 - on both sides
139:10 - but uh no uh
139:13 - above and below and uh
139:16 - zero on both sides and give it a
139:20 - width of a 90 percent and the plus icon
139:23 - will
139:24 - going going to be a display of flex and
139:27 - we will just center that
139:29 - so that should cut it uh once we import
139:32 - that
139:33 - file into our app.js
139:38 - so we're just going to say import site
139:40 - icons
139:41 - from components
139:44 - and side icons and that's good
139:51 - so we're just gonna decide our cons
139:56 - we should be good to go soon all right
139:59 - there we go
140:00 - there you have it over there the side
140:02 - icons
140:04 - now one more thing left to do which is
140:06 - the authentication
140:07 - and this is going to be super super easy
140:09 - because we are
140:11 - using firebase so what is going to
140:15 - happen here
140:16 - is that if we go back to our app.js
140:19 - file we will remove all these dummy data
140:25 - right and that will leave us a
140:28 - completely empty uh use date right
140:33 - so that means we do not have a logged in
140:36 - the user
140:36 - at this specific moment in time
140:40 - and to make sure that that you uh that
140:43 - no
140:45 - there is no user that is unauthorized
140:48 - can log in
140:49 - we will need to make sure that if the if
140:52 - there is no user
140:55 - we okay so if there is a user then we
140:58 - want to
140:59 - smash the like button and put all these
141:02 - things here
141:03 - but if there is no user then we want to
141:07 - make sure that
141:08 - uh a login is enforced
141:11 - so in that case
141:15 - in that case we will be throwing that in
141:19 - and also make sure that there is a
141:22 - container tag on
141:25 - both sides so in case we have the user
141:30 - we would just throw everything in there
141:32 - in between these empty tags
141:33 - so that makes uh so everything is going
141:36 - to be
141:37 - uh smashed into one little piece as well
141:40 - as
141:41 - down here and if there is no user
141:44 - then we will just uh throw this app
141:47 - login in here
141:48 - we will just throw in the google drive
141:50 - logo
141:52 - and a button that will enforce the login
141:56 - now for that to work we will need the
141:58 - google drive logo to be
141:59 - imported and we
142:02 - this is where we will be using
142:06 - uh the authentication and the provider
142:10 - that we exported
142:11 - from firebase now uh
142:15 - we are only 99 people at this point uh
142:18 - so to get in a few people make sure to
142:21 - let everybody know
142:22 - who is watching uh just call in a few
142:24 - friends just finish it off
142:25 - 100 plus make sure we finish this
142:28 - off strong so user
142:31 - is available just in js es7 nope we need
142:35 - to set it first so this is the user that
142:37 - i'm referring to
142:38 - here okay so i don't want i don't want
142:40 - that to be
142:42 - mixed up now we will be firing off
142:46 - this um handle login
142:50 - function over here so for that to work
142:52 - we are going to be
142:54 - uh say han const handle login
142:57 - and that function is going to
143:00 - check if there is a user
143:04 - [Music]
143:07 - because if there isn't a user
143:12 - right yeah
143:16 - stay home i'm home all right
143:19 - so if there is no user then what we will
143:22 - say is auth
143:23 - dot sign in with popup
143:27 - so that will create a new window
143:30 - and we just throw in the provider which
143:32 - is the google
143:34 - sign-in provider then we will get some
143:36 - sort of result
143:38 - and with that result we want to do a few
143:41 - different things
143:42 - so then we want to set the user
143:46 - and we're just gonna say result
143:50 - result dot user
143:54 - and that's it
143:58 - that's pretty much it let's take a look
144:02 - at what's happening here okay
144:04 - we need to make sure that it looks cool
144:06 - and nice
144:07 - so for that we are gonna go into app.css
144:12 - and
144:15 - oh servers are rendering lately yes we
144:18 - will actually
144:18 - actually i'm gonna be dropping a few
144:20 - different tutorials on that too for so
144:23 - stay tuned for that all right so and
144:26 - lastly we will make it look nice so app
144:30 - uh app log
144:33 - in and we will say width of a hundred
144:38 - view width yes height
144:42 - of 100 view height
144:45 - we will say display grid
144:48 - display grid this time and we're just
144:50 - going to say
144:52 - place items actually
144:56 - and we will say center
145:00 - and the button inside of there is going
145:04 - to be
145:07 - it's not going to have a border we will
145:09 - set the font size to 24 pixel
145:12 - background color this is some sort of
145:14 - bluish 67 130
145:16 - and 244 we will set the color to white
145:20 - the padding to 10 pixel uh on above and
145:23 - below
145:24 - 20 pixel on the sides and the border
145:26 - radius is gonna be
145:27 - six pixels and we will set all the
145:29 - transitions to
145:31 - point two seconds because
145:34 - when we hover over it
145:38 - uh we will set the cursor to pointer
145:41 - and the background color to this darker
145:44 - blue which is for
145:45 - 49.94 179 and a transform of 1.1
145:51 - scale so let's see how that looks like
145:53 - this is how it looks like and if i hover
145:55 - over it it
145:56 - becomes a little bit bitter just a tad
145:59 - and a little bit darker
146:01 - so that's a nice little touch with the
146:04 - ui
146:04 - over there i am over here signing in
146:08 - with google
146:09 - clicking that link and
146:13 - with that i can just add a new file
146:18 - say
