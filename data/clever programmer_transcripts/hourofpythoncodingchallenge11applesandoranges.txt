00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hey how's it going this is kazy from
00:10 - clever program.com and in this video
00:12 - we're going to be tackling the apples
00:14 - and oranges
00:16 - challenge so let's get into it now
00:19 - hopefully you finished all your string
00:22 - challenges and your dictionary
00:24 - challenges and you are all caught up to
00:27 - do some amazing new challenges like the
00:29 - type challenges there's only one
00:30 - challenge in here so I don't know why
00:32 - they pluralized it it's their
00:34 - fault but this challenge is about types
00:38 - and types in Python lets you check what
00:41 - type is something so for example if you
00:45 - picked up an apple you'd be like hey
00:47 - this is a fruit and if you picked up uh
00:49 - I don't know something else like a
00:51 - carrot you'll be like hey this is a
00:52 - vegetable okay so as a human we know
00:55 - what types are but in programming there
00:57 - are different types as well and they're
01:00 - important to know because you can then
01:03 - use it to create really cool stuff all
01:06 - right
01:08 - so here we're going to learn to go
01:10 - through types and detect them okay so
01:13 - let's go through
01:16 - that
01:18 - now you have
01:21 - types like string which you can see over
01:24 - here right um and if you call this type
01:27 - function on a string anything that's
01:30 - within
01:31 - quotes oh I can just type it in here so
01:33 - if I say hello and we want to see what
01:36 - type this is you already know it's a
01:38 - string but don't take my word for it
01:40 - type in the type function and it'll tell
01:43 - you exactly what type it is and look at
01:46 - that it says it's a
01:47 - string now here what we're doing is
01:50 - we're saying hey check if type one type
01:53 - one should give you back an integer so
01:57 - for example one is an integer right so
02:00 - if you type that in you'll get back a
02:02 - class integer or type integer so
02:05 - basically we're asking here hey is type
02:07 - of one the same as a type of this thing
02:10 - in
02:11 - quotes and we find out that's false
02:14 - because type
02:15 - one um here we got false type one is an
02:19 - integer class and this one is a string
02:22 - class so a string class is not the same
02:25 - thing as an integer class just like an
02:27 - apple is not the same thing as a banana
02:31 - or an orange right same idea
02:36 - here all right let's see what the heck
02:40 - they want us to do so they say make a
02:42 - function that returns apples if given a
02:44 - string oranges if given an integer and
02:46 - bananas if given anything else okay very
02:49 - simple they're
02:50 - saying hey if you give me something like
02:53 - a hello or something that a human would
02:55 - say uh you know using a string anything
02:58 - in quotes you should return apples if
03:01 - you detect the human saying something if
03:04 - you see an integer like a number then
03:07 - say oranges otherwise say something else
03:10 - all right cool that is not too bad so
03:13 - basically we'll
03:15 - say that if um type of thing whatever
03:20 - the user typed in is equal equal to type
03:25 - of uh an
03:28 - integer right
03:30 - um I wonder if we can say int here we
03:32 - probably can let's try it let's try it
03:35 - type of one equal equal int boom we can
03:40 - okay so if whatever the user typed in if
03:43 - the type of that is uh is the same type
03:46 - as int then what we can
03:51 - say is return
03:56 - oranges oranges like that
04:01 - okay this is going to be else
04:04 - if and then uh here what we're going to
04:07 - say is if the type of
04:12 - thing is a
04:15 - string then I want you to return
04:18 - apples right so I have to write return
04:21 - statement here and then I'll
04:25 - say otherwise just return the thing so
04:29 - this would work fine but just to be
04:31 - extra clear I'll write an else statement
04:34 - I'll say
04:36 - return bananas like
04:40 - that okay so we have what have we done
04:44 - here we've distilled English into code
04:48 - okay we've turned an idea into reality
04:52 - right we uh executed it so that's what
04:56 - coding allows you to do that's the power
04:58 - of it and that's why it's so important
05:00 - to do these coding challenges because
05:02 - literally that's what coding is going to
05:05 - be in your head like you have an idea
05:07 - right that you came up with and the idea
05:09 - you came up with is in English like I
05:10 - want to make a gaming app that stores uh
05:13 - each user's account information it it
05:15 - stores how much gold they have it stores
05:18 - uh what item they use uh it Stores um
05:21 - how many characters they've purchased
05:24 - already right so that's an idea that you
05:26 - have had in English or whatever language
05:28 - right and and then coding you have to
05:32 - take that whatever you said in your own
05:34 - language and break it down into
05:36 - something that the computer can can
05:38 - understand so then you can scale it to
05:39 - the whole world okay so that's what it
05:42 - comes down to that's why I emphasize
05:44 - these challenges so much cuz this is
05:47 - literally how you'll improve your skills
05:49 - and it teaches you the real world skills
05:52 - to go get a job and to even uh be useful
05:55 - and be a functional and badass developer
06:00 - okay so let's continue rolling here and
06:02 - let's see if we're right right I had
06:05 - this whole speech and I swear to God if
06:07 - I hit play right now and I'm wrong I'm
06:09 - going to look like an idiot so let's
06:11 - let's hit play and let's see what
06:13 - happens okay all right boom I typed in
06:16 - the number four and I got back oranges
06:20 - so it looks like it's correct uh if you
06:23 - so basically if you give the function
06:25 - fruit label
06:27 - labeler uh integer it should give you
06:29 - back oranges well what happens if I give
06:31 - it a string like
06:33 - hello it should give me back apples and
06:35 - it does and what happens if I give it uh
06:39 - something that's not an integer or a
06:41 - string can you come up with an example
06:44 - of something that's not an integer or a
06:48 - string okay if you haven't come up with
06:50 - an example pause try to come up with one
06:53 - if you can't continue and an example
06:57 - would be a float number so a float
06:58 - number mean
07:01 - like a decimal number like 4.5 that's
07:03 - not an integer or a string so let's hit
07:06 - the play button and indeed we get
07:08 - bananas that's exactly how they wanted
07:11 - us to do this challenge
07:14 - right okay so that's it for this
07:16 - challenge hopefully you learned
07:18 - hopefully you had a blast and if you're
07:20 - on my website or you click the link
07:22 - below put it in the comments if you're
07:24 - on YouTube put it in the comments I
07:26 - don't care if you had the wrong solution
07:28 - or the right solution if you had the
07:30 - wrong solution you know the drill come
07:32 - back the next day or come back a few
07:34 - hours later and try to do it yourself
07:37 - from scratch because without doing you
07:39 - can't become a better coder if you're
07:42 - just reading and watching tutorials you
07:43 - won't become better you have to practice
07:47 - it and try it yourself even though a lot
07:49 - of the times it feels like it's
07:50 - unproductive you're blank-minded and
07:53 - you're just looking at a screen and
07:54 - you're like this is not productive but
07:56 - believe it or not it is productive and
07:58 - it's actually a NE Neary thing to do to
08:01 - improve okay that's it for this video
08:04 - guys thank you so much for watching this
08:07 - concludes the hour of python series I
08:11 - hope that you had a lot of fun you
08:13 - enjoyed this sign up for my new course
08:16 - called create apps with python because
08:18 - that will take all these skills that you
08:21 - culminated Within These weeks doing
08:23 - these challenges and it'll put them to
08:25 - use by building apps with the python
08:28 - skills that you're learning here and
08:30 - that you honed here okay so we're going
08:33 - to take your skills and your ideas and
08:35 - turn them into reality into apps okay so
08:39 - that's it thank you guys so much for
08:41 - watching and as always I'll see you in
08:44 - the next
08:49 - video
