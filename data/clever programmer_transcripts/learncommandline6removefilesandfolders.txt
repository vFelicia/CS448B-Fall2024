00:00 - hey guys welcome back to the learn
00:02 - command line tutorial so what if we want
00:07 - to remove a
00:09 - file that's where I I told you guys
00:12 - we're going to pick back up so let's
00:14 - jump into that so remember how we C
00:16 - created playground we're going to remove
00:18 - that from here and then I will have you
00:21 - go and practice that so removing is a
00:25 - very simple command it's just
00:28 - RM okay
00:31 - RM that's it followed by it takes in an
00:34 - argument so you pass it what you want it
00:37 - to delete so we can say
00:40 - RM playground okay and it says RM
00:45 - playground is a directory so you can't
00:47 - necessarily remove directories in one go
00:50 - I'll teach you a trick for that as well
00:54 - that it's a little bit more advanced but
00:56 - you need to pass it a switch dasr for
00:59 - now just do it without kind of really
01:01 - thinking about it but later on I'll show
01:04 - you guys uh how it actually works okay
01:09 - so I did rm- R playground it goes
01:12 - examine files in directory I said yes
01:14 - and then it goes remove playground I
01:16 - said yes y means yes and it essentially
01:19 - removed it it's not there anymore notice
01:21 - playground is gone how cool is that I
01:24 - didn't do anything it was just magic I
01:26 - didn't have to touch the goey it just
01:28 - took care took care of it for me well
01:32 - now let's bring playground back so I'm
01:35 - going to do mkdir
01:39 - playground and we should have it back
01:41 - and in playground let's just add a file
01:45 - all right let's add a new file
01:51 - so um what would be the fastest way to
01:55 - add a file
01:58 - here
02:06 - playground new
02:15 - file okay kind of don't worry about how
02:17 - I did that so much
02:20 - because whoops don't need that
02:25 - one don't need that one I just needed to
02:28 - create this file here that says some
02:30 - example whatever uh we don't care what
02:33 - it actually is we just care it's a file
02:35 - it could have been a movie it could have
02:37 - been uh a picture a JPEG file a PNG file
02:43 - mov file it really doesn't matter I just
02:45 - needed to create a file uh I have again
02:48 - I have some other shortcut set up for my
02:50 - Sublime Text to open and I essentially
02:52 - am saying open Sublime Text or St here
02:56 - in the current directory which is the
02:57 - one period I explained to you guys in
02:59 - the last video two periods as Parent
03:01 - Directory so a previous directory but
03:03 - what I want to show you after creating
03:05 - this file is how to remove the file well
03:07 - that's is just simple as RM
03:10 - example um oh I'm sorry I have to So
03:13 - currently I'm in documents I need to go
03:15 - into playground so once I'm in
03:17 - playground and I hit LS I'll see
03:19 - example.py which is right here
03:22 - example.py and I'm going to do RM
03:25 - playground or sorry example and when I
03:28 - hit tab remember to hit Tab and
03:30 - autocomplete and I'm going to hit enter
03:32 - let's see what happens it goes remove
03:34 - example.py I'm going to say yes and it
03:37 - removed
03:38 - it and be careful be very careful when
03:42 - you're using these remove commands
03:44 - because if you remove something it's
03:47 - gone
03:48 - forever it's not going to go into your
03:50 - recycling bin where it's going to stay
03:52 - for 30 days and let you delete it and
03:54 - clean it up out of there or retrieve it
03:56 - later it's just wiped off of your your
03:59 - hard drive right away so when you are
04:02 - using RM these commands just make sure
04:06 - that you know what you're doing when
04:08 - you're running these commands now when
04:09 - you do RM it might not ask you like are
04:13 - you sure you want to delete I have set
04:14 - it to that so I can't delete anything by
04:17 - mistake uh but regardless just be
04:20 - careful when you're running this command
04:22 - okay that's how you remove files and
04:24 - that's how you remove folders that's it
04:26 - for this video I'll show you perhaps in
04:28 - the next video how we can rename files
04:30 - and folders okay I'll see you there
