00:00 - so this is Kazi from clever programmer
00:02 - calm and in this video i want to talk
00:04 - about the windows command line okay so
00:14 - first of all regarding yesterday's video
00:16 - engineer truth I do not hate his channel
00:19 - I do not hate him he's awesome if you
00:21 - want to learn about realistic career
00:22 - videos you should actually watch some of
00:24 - his videos that video was just made out
00:27 - of fun no it wasn't to try to get more
00:29 - views like I got some comments or it
00:31 - wasn't that I hate that channel or
00:34 - anything like that and no I will not
00:35 - delete it because if I start deleting
00:38 - things you know that's something that
00:40 - connects with me I thought it was funny
00:42 - and I posted it around the channel I'm
00:44 - sorry to fit if it offends certain
00:46 - people but again my goal was not
00:49 - actually go after somebody or hurt them
00:52 - or whatever it was just a funny video it
00:54 - was a big coincidence and I wanted to
00:56 - just talk about it
00:57 - well anyways don't worry because you
01:00 - will be getting a lot of awesome content
01:01 - soon starting right now
01:05 - so first thing I want to talk about was
01:07 - a lot I'm getting a lot of questions on
01:09 - ok
01:10 - hey Kazi you made all these videos on
01:13 - the command line but on Windows do these
01:16 - commands even work and my answer to that
01:19 - is no the command line that the built-in
01:23 - command line of Windows is very
01:24 - different tip number one that's gonna be
01:26 - really beneficial for you is in Windows
01:29 - there's something called PowerShell so
01:31 - when you look up command prompt don't
01:36 - open up command prompt like don't type
01:38 - in CMD that's one of the weaker versions
01:41 - of the command lines open a PowerShell
01:43 - it's much better it has some
01:46 - functionality like Mac command lines or
01:49 - Ubuntu command lines because Windows
01:51 - command lines sucks and I hate to break
01:54 - it to you guys but I've been using I've
01:56 - used every operating system there is but
01:59 - Windows command line has been the worst
02:02 - by far it's such a pain to make many
02:04 - things work even if you're working in
02:06 - different programming languages and
02:09 - you're trying to do just import
02:10 - something it will be so simple in every
02:13 - other opera
02:14 - system ever but then in Windows they'll
02:16 - have it's like separate tutorial that
02:18 - you have to follow but I understand it
02:21 - might not align with your budget getting
02:22 - a MacBook Pro or your ecosystem so
02:24 - that's not what I want to recommend to
02:26 - you instead I'm gonna just show you guys
02:28 - something that will be helpful to you
02:30 - and valuable to you as you're following
02:32 - along these tutorials so if you see me
02:36 - do things like PWD and stuff if you open
02:40 - up the PowerShell your PWD command
02:42 - should work okay other commands like
02:46 - m'kay dirt and the PowerShell should
02:49 - work that's how you can make a directory
02:51 - CD for changing directories should also
02:54 - work at rmdir should also work so if you
02:59 - can just open up literally powershell
03:01 - okay that's how it is on Windows P o wer
03:05 - sh DLL most of the Mac built-in command
03:10 - lines like should work but if you're
03:13 - opening up the CMD for whatever reason
03:16 - and that's the one you want to use then
03:18 - the commands of that are going to be a
03:20 - lot different
03:22 - okay but I would suggest use PowerShell
03:24 - because after Windows seven they added
03:27 - that and I think that in when in Windows
03:29 - 10 it's definitely there as well so use
03:32 - the powershell and this resource that
03:35 - i'm on is called learn Python the hard
03:37 - way org I'll link it in the description
03:40 - below and it has some useful command
03:43 - lines that you could look up yourself
03:45 - and learn from so maybe you could use
03:48 - these command lines and get ahead of the
03:51 - tutorial series that I'm teaching you
03:53 - guys so you can use this to prepare
03:55 - yourselves and learn more things as well
03:58 - ok so yeah that's it for this video I
04:04 - hope you guys enjoyed it I hope you guys
04:05 - learned something new and we will just
04:08 - get on produce more awesome content and
04:10 - I'll show you guys some more cool things
04:12 - all right can't wait to see you in the
04:14 - next video
