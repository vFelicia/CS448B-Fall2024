02:20 - software developers without needing a
02:22 - college degree and so we're going to
02:23 - touch
02:24 - a few points a few of the skills that we
02:25 - think are the most important that you
02:27 - need to pick up
02:28 - you know to actually land a job or even
02:31 - get your career started with programming
02:33 - so let's get into it guys

02:46 - let's go thank you man thank you so yeah
02:49 - man tesla
02:50 - twitter whole foods now is is owned by
02:52 - amazon
02:53 - which is pretty much a tech company as
02:55 - well you know you can order your
02:56 - groceries online and everything
02:57 - google as you know facebook instagram
03:01 - costco all of these companies hire
03:03 - without needing a college degree
03:06 - let's go yeah and it's worth noticing
03:07 - that netflix is one of the highest
03:10 - paying companies when it comes to
03:12 - software development which is insane
03:14 - yeah how much was the pay you you
03:16 - actually told me a little bit ago
03:17 - 330k dude they pay their developers
03:20 - which is insane
03:21 - that is and they don't require a college
03:23 - degree that's almost
03:25 - half a million dollars and was it to be
03:27 - a front-end developer
03:28 - for netflix yep yep that's right
03:32 - that's insane some people think you
03:33 - cannot earn enough being a front-end
03:35 - developer
03:35 - some people think you earn even more
03:37 - being you know a full stack or a
03:39 - back-end developer but it really does
03:41 - depend on what company you're working
03:43 - for
03:44 - so now with that in mind let's kind of
03:47 - go into this
03:48 - you know whole presentation i think a
03:49 - lot of value is going to be given so
03:51 - guys
03:51 - please pay respect to sunny and our
03:55 - presentation knowledge everything we're
03:56 - trying to share because it's really
03:58 - going to up
03:58 - all your skills so let's go into it yeah
04:02 - awesome step cool you want to kind of
04:05 - explain this sunny
04:08 - yeah so guys the first thing we want to
04:10 - talk about right is
04:11 - whenever we sort of jump around this
04:13 - sort of stuff have a why
04:15 - right and the way we're going to talk
04:16 - about how like finding your why today
04:18 - is know what your end goal is right so
04:21 - in this case
04:22 - on this channel we talk a lot about
04:23 - javascript as our main main programming
04:25 - language that we want to learn
04:27 - we're going to teach you guys and we
04:28 - also want to show you the possibilities
04:30 - when you are using javascript
04:32 - now here we have like three different
04:35 - options that javascript
04:36 - can bring you and what we want to focus
04:38 - on right now is understanding
04:41 - what you understanding the sort of
04:43 - possibilities that you can go into so
04:45 - one
04:45 - we have the ability to teach so you can
04:47 - see on the top right we have javascript
04:49 - and then we have the ability
04:50 - to teach with javascript and you can see
04:52 - that's going to be something where you
04:54 - can actually earn
04:55 - a bit of money very very quickly right
04:57 - so like
04:58 - very very quickly you can start earning
05:00 - an income with uh with the ability to
05:01 - teach
05:02 - the second thing we're going to talk
05:03 - about is the ability uh to jump in and
05:05 - handle freelance clients right so you
05:07 - can see this is something which is going
05:08 - to give you a bit more money
05:10 - and it's going to be a case of like you
05:11 - can handle if you can handle one client
05:13 - or 50 clients
05:14 - it's completely down to you right and
05:16 - then the final one is where everyone
05:17 - wants to get to and that's landing
05:19 - amazing jobs at google netflix
05:21 - uh instagram apple those kind of things
05:23 - and those companies pay
05:24 - big guys so just what we want you guys
05:27 - to sort of pay attention to is a
05:28 - while like before you actually jump into
05:30 - this video right now
05:32 - just have your end goal in mind right
05:34 - and he
05:35 - all of these things guys allow different
05:37 - possibilities the
05:38 - the final one landing a permanent job is
05:40 - going to give you stability
05:42 - freelancing means you can travel
05:44 - anywhere guys
05:45 - like you can literally work remotely you
05:47 - can do whatever you want to do
05:49 - and you can handle your clients as long
05:50 - as you have laptop and internet
05:51 - connection
05:52 - and the first one being the ability to
05:54 - teach is literally going to be something
05:55 - which you can start doing
05:57 - from day one so if you start uh coding a
05:59 - week
06:00 - you're now a week ahead of somebody
06:02 - who's never coded before so you can
06:03 - offer immediate value yeah that's even
06:05 - gonna go through today michael lecompte
06:07 - right he was here
06:08 - i think yesterday he was on a live and
06:10 - michael actually started
06:11 - getting a bunch of clients just teaching
06:13 - them how to code with
06:15 - i think it was c plus his one of his
06:18 - most strong languages and understandings
06:19 - of
06:20 - you can actually build a career out of
06:22 - teaching people
06:23 - and actually earn good income he was
06:24 - earning around 4 000 a month
06:26 - he's still getting clients to this day
06:28 - and scaling that business up while doing
06:30 - other things on the side
06:33 - amazing and guys we would honestly
06:34 - recommend that you always be teaching on
06:36 - the side
06:37 - so it doesn't matter if you are doing
06:38 - freelancing or landing a permanent
06:40 - position
06:40 - there's always going to be a room for a
06:42 - side income when it comes to teaching so
06:44 - amazing thing to know and bear in mind
06:46 - and the cool thing about teaching
06:47 - as well is the fact that you know you're
06:49 - earning money while
06:51 - learning even more so you're kind of
06:53 - engraving those those
06:54 - understandings really really well inside
06:56 - of your head inside of you know
06:58 - actually outside of you because you get
07:00 - reference experience of the people you
07:02 - know processing your information you
07:04 - have to refine your information once
07:05 - you're sharing it with others
07:06 - and that's going to make you even a
07:08 - better coder
07:10 - exactly we have loads of comments coming
07:12 - in guys how to
07:14 - my end angle is to become a freelance
07:16 - developer awesome ali malay
07:18 - nice my goal is to have boats you can
07:21 - have both
07:22 - if you do really well guys so like this
07:24 - is completely
07:25 - this is something you have control over
07:27 - nice i did want to touch on the fact
07:29 - that
07:29 - each specific journey that you take for
07:31 - example if you're teaching
07:33 - code or if you want to become a
07:34 - freelancer or if you want to get a high
07:36 - paying job at a tech company
07:38 - you know all of these skills all of
07:40 - these actual choices
07:42 - require different skills so for example
07:44 - if you're going to become a freelancer
07:45 - sometimes becoming a freelancer actually
07:48 - entails having a little bit more soft
07:50 - skills having a little bit more business
07:51 - skills
07:52 - you know sometimes people that look for
07:54 - top tech jobs
07:55 - might not have that that edge of
07:57 - business and that's why they might wanna
08:00 - build other things build bigger things
08:02 - and and you know that's kind of where
08:03 - their focus is at
08:04 - so i think personality is a big big big
08:07 - factor in
08:08 - distinguishing what journey to take what
08:10 - goal to
08:11 - have in mind huge massive massively yeah
08:15 - i mean like you get some developers out
08:17 - there who have all the technical skills
08:19 - but they can't really hold a
08:20 - conversation for longer than five
08:21 - minutes well they're very introverted
08:23 - and guys you do need a balance you do
08:25 - need a balance
08:27 - awesome yeah so we're going to touch on
08:29 - the number one big point
08:31 - and we feel like communication is key so
08:34 - suddenly you want to explain a little
08:35 - bit of the differences of styles of
08:37 - communication
08:39 - yeah so exactly guys communication is
08:42 - going to be one of the biggest things
08:43 - which is why we've actually put it as
08:45 - um the number one sort of one of the
08:47 - number uh the highest of
08:49 - skills that you need to know as a
08:50 - self-taught developer so interpersonal
08:52 - and non-social so we've broken them down
08:54 - into two different things right
08:55 - interpersonal when we say that we're
08:57 - talking about soft skills we're talking
08:59 - about like
09:00 - your time management your leadership
09:01 - your ability to work in a team
09:03 - all of those things are crucial to your
09:06 - success as a developer now you may not
09:08 - think about these things when you're
09:09 - developing you might just be thinking
09:11 - like
09:11 - about technical aspects and like um but
09:14 - do i just need to learn the language and
09:15 - that's going to be it
09:16 - but guys do not underestimate these
09:18 - abilities this is the difference between
09:20 - a developer is going to get paid like 30
09:22 - 000 a year
09:23 - to 100 000 a year literally a case of
09:25 - that like it's going to be huge
09:27 - right frankie definitely and obviously
09:29 - you know for you to be able to manage a
09:31 - team to work with a team
09:33 - to influence other people your
09:35 - communication skills have to be on point
09:37 - specifically if you want to become a
09:38 - good developer and you want to
09:40 - let your team know what exactly you're
09:42 - doing with the code
09:43 - you have to be able to you know present
09:46 - that in a fashion that people can digest
09:48 - so definitely interpersonal
09:50 - communications is
09:51 - one of the biggest aspects of coding
09:54 - that you can actually
09:55 - you know take into account that not a
09:57 - lot of people take into account
09:59 - now exactly i'm gonna touch a little bit
10:01 - into non-social communication
10:04 - so the non-social aspect of
10:05 - communication i think
10:07 - tech lead actually talked about it being
10:09 - anti-social communication
10:11 - just in general i did not like that name
10:13 - i was a little bit biased towards it
10:14 - but i feel like it's a very important
10:17 - point to touch just because
10:18 - you know it's one of the biggest things
10:20 - of non-social is
10:22 - talking through email making blog posts
10:25 - making
10:26 - actual things that are written
10:28 - crystallized because
10:29 - if you have a some sort of storage for
10:31 - that communication
10:32 - other people can actually access it and
10:34 - add to it and then learn from it and
10:36 - even you know make changes from it
10:39 - so that's exactly right and guys this is
10:42 - something which is huge when you have
10:44 - like
10:44 - let's say you you start a tech company
10:46 - right or you have you built a product
10:48 - and your product's amazing right
10:50 - like you need to be able to tell or like
10:52 - market your product and like why this is
10:54 - one thing i actually fell victim to
10:56 - i just i became so like entrapped with
10:59 - the
10:59 - the sort of mindset of coding that i
11:01 - literally forgot and i actually got
11:03 - really bad at the the sort of
11:05 - other skills like writing like and it
11:07 - sounds very silly but like
11:08 - coding is all about writing shorthand
11:10 - right it's all about writing
11:11 - short variables or like getting your
11:13 - code neat and concise
11:15 - and guys you need to remember like you
11:16 - need to keep hold of those other
11:18 - abilities in terms of like
11:20 - writing writing really sort of effective
11:22 - emails or effective blog posts or like
11:25 - even medium posts it's amazing not only
11:27 - to write like to read them
11:29 - i think it's really good practice to
11:30 - actually like incorporate reading them
11:32 - in a day to day but like also
11:34 - actually writing your own medium posts
11:36 - is really important um and i think it
11:37 - will actually benefit you a lot
11:39 - so let me ask you sony what got you out
11:41 - of that type of mind frame of
11:43 - you know having your head inside of the
11:45 - code too much and actually you know
11:46 - unraveling yourself to becoming a better
11:49 - communicator
11:51 - what was that so honestly but honestly
11:53 - failure
11:54 - failure was my number one sort of
11:55 - teacher through everything um
11:57 - i found like i just hit a wall right
11:59 - like i hit a wall
12:00 - so i remember i built a little product
12:02 - once and i was wondering that like
12:03 - nobody was buying it right like nobody
12:05 - was buying this thing that i built
12:07 - um and it just came down to a point of
12:09 - like i was
12:10 - sort of stuck in a place where where i
12:12 - didn't know the next step and i was like
12:14 - hang on i've done everything technically
12:16 - correct
12:17 - but like i feel like i've done
12:18 - everything so why is it not working and
12:20 - then it was only until
12:21 - i started surrounding myself with people
12:23 - like like carsi frankie aaron like all
12:25 - the guys
12:26 - and i realized marketing and that
12:27 - ability to speak
12:29 - to your customers and the ability to
12:30 - actually communicate with people
12:32 - um is huge right and not only that as a
12:36 - developer
12:36 - your ability to to actually have that
12:39 - side of the skill set as well is massive
12:42 - even with your communication to your
12:43 - employees or to your team members
12:45 - everything it really does make a
12:46 - difference so i think
12:48 - frank let's jump on to actual like
12:50 - what's the sort of soft skills
12:52 - and because a lot of people hear it
12:53 - being thrown around but we don't
12:54 - actually understand what that means so
12:56 - what are soft skills
12:58 - here we go so soft skills they're also
13:00 - known as people skills or interpersonal
13:02 - skills like we already talked about it
13:04 - and you know some of the examples that
13:06 - you can see here on screen
13:07 - would be you know leadership is a huge
13:10 - one teamwork is a huge one
13:12 - time management is really big too and
13:14 - obviously
13:15 - communication is all part of that the
13:16 - flexibility in your communication is
13:18 - also what's going to take you to
13:20 - you know do hard things like negotiation
13:23 - hard things like
13:24 - conflict resolution and things of the
13:26 - sort so
13:27 - all of these type of things are called
13:29 - soft skills and it is
13:30 - you know the skills relating to dealing
13:33 - with other type of people
13:35 - exactly and like this is usually like a
13:38 - good comparison here is comparing them
13:39 - to something like hard skills so
13:41 - remember earlier this whole talk is
13:42 - about pretty much why you don't need a
13:44 - degree
13:45 - and how you can succeed as a self-taught
13:47 - developer so in this case
13:49 - we tend to actually prioritize our hard
13:51 - skills so like
13:52 - how quick can we type um how good am i a
13:55 - programming language or do i have the
13:56 - degree or do i have a certificate which
13:58 - proves i'm good at this
13:59 - right but let's say you have everything
14:01 - on the left side right let's say you can
14:03 - speak like five languages
14:05 - you can code in like five four different
14:06 - other languages you have a degree
14:08 - you can type really fast but let's say
14:10 - you lacked all of the social skills
14:12 - let's say you couldn't even like hold a
14:14 - proper conversation or you can actually
14:16 - express your ability to code as a
14:18 - developer right
14:19 - that immediately cuts to your chances of
14:21 - landing the position or job or client
14:24 - jump like drastically you know because
14:26 - not only would
14:27 - work with you right at the end of the
14:29 - day yeah and
14:31 - exactly and you how can you build trust
14:33 - if you're not able to portray like what
14:35 - you're
14:35 - you're capable of what you can deliver
14:38 - all of that requires that communication
14:40 - flexibility leadership those things
14:42 - which are very much listed on the right
14:44 - and um something which was massively
14:46 - useful
14:47 - right so this was i think uh frankie
14:49 - have you read this book as well
14:50 - soft skills i've never actually i just
14:52 - heard amazing stories from it
14:54 - from kazi from you we actually met john
14:57 - sonmez
14:58 - as well so we even see it in his
15:00 - personality right that it's just
15:01 - something that's been integrated into
15:03 - him and
15:03 - also people from the company as well you
15:05 - and qazi yeah
15:07 - exactly and you know what that's a
15:09 - that's a really cool story that
15:10 - frankie touched on there so that's
15:12 - actually how like
15:13 - i watched a video back in the day where
15:16 - kazi released it about some books that
15:17 - you should read
15:18 - one of those books was soft skills and
15:20 - pretty much it opened my mindset
15:22 - as to like all of these the skills which
15:24 - you can pretty much see unlisted on the
15:26 - right
15:26 - and um that actually led to me
15:29 - eventually working with the clever
15:30 - programmer team guys
15:32 - so like don't ever take these as like
15:34 - skills that oh
15:35 - you know i can learn them later on or
15:36 - down the line these could potentially
15:38 - change your life
15:39 - like like these will affect your life as
15:41 - a developer massively
15:43 - and there are skills which take time to
15:44 - develop just like it does with coding
15:46 - and you should invest like that time and
15:48 - it's going to pay off
15:49 - like it will and this book guys it's
15:51 - called soft skills uh the software
15:53 - developer's life manual
15:54 - by john sonmez and i would 100 recommend
15:56 - that everyone
15:57 - goes ahead and grabs that book yeah and
15:59 - the thing is
16:00 - the biggest way that it's that soft
16:02 - skills are actually going to change your
16:04 - life
16:04 - is due to the fact that you're going to
16:06 - be able to communicate with people
16:08 - and people are everything man companies
16:10 - are made out of people you know software
16:11 - is built by people
16:12 - so when you do refine your communication
16:15 - skills then you'll build more
16:16 - relationships then you'll have more
16:18 - opportunities then you'll see what else
16:19 - to do
16:20 - so that's the way that it's that soft
16:21 - skills are going to change your life
16:24 - exactly exactly somebody said a book
16:26 - another book road map to freelance
16:28 - developer
16:29 - um oh no that's a video i don't know my
16:32 - bad it's a video
16:33 - uh okay awesome so you know touching on
16:36 - communication
16:37 - that really does lead me to like i said
16:40 - building relationships one of the most
16:42 - important relationships you can build
16:44 - is actually finding yourself a mentor
16:47 - so you spoke about you spoke about the
16:49 - importance for you right
16:52 - what was that you spoke about the
16:54 - importance of finding a mentor for
16:55 - yourself right
16:56 - can you tell me a little bit about your
16:58 - experience this was like
16:59 - game changer for me like honestly if i
17:02 - could
17:03 - if i could list like the things which
17:04 - made me a better developer from like one
17:06 - to ten
17:07 - this would be like number one because
17:09 - every time i was in a position
17:11 - or i was like even if i was freelancing
17:13 - i would reach out or i'd go to like
17:15 - these conferences and things like that
17:16 - and i would go ahead and actually try
17:19 - and find myself a mentor like whether
17:21 - that be a senior developer at the
17:22 - company
17:23 - whether that be like somebody who's just
17:24 - a little bit more experienced in like
17:26 - react or redux or something like that
17:28 - i would make it a mission to find
17:30 - somebody who actually
17:32 - was um like a level higher than me right
17:35 - and
17:35 - um that the reason why guys is because
17:38 - that is going to save you
17:40 - so many hours i cannot stress it like if
17:42 - you're all if you are new to development
17:44 - or like you're
17:45 - you're in that self-taught journey find
17:47 - somebody whether it be through facebook
17:50 - whether through the youtube comment
17:51 - section find somebody through stack
17:53 - overflow
17:54 - just find somebody who knows a little
17:55 - bit more than you and literally
17:57 - ask them just ask them because most
17:59 - people they just they they don't think
18:00 - you can ask
18:02 - when when in reality if somebody came up
18:04 - to you and approached you and said hey
18:05 - you're really good at something would
18:07 - you mind teaching me
18:09 - you need to think about it like chances
18:10 - are you probably would say yes so you
18:12 - probably would be like oh yeah i don't
18:13 - mean like this guy's gonna
18:15 - they're making you feel good and at that
18:16 - point you would want to learn and it's
18:18 - going to save you a lot of time and
18:19 - headache
18:20 - with debugging and a lot of other issues
18:23 - what's your thoughts on that frankie
18:24 - definitely man i think it is a shortcut
18:26 - to life to be completely honest with you
18:28 - just because
18:29 - of the fact that somebody else already
18:31 - put the time in to learn some skill
18:34 - so they have already invested a bunch of
18:36 - time and probably had
18:37 - so many failures in that specific
18:39 - subject that whenever they speak to you
18:41 - it's just going to be a huge
18:42 - shortcut for your experience as well
18:44 - it's you know it's learning through
18:45 - osmosis and one of the things that i
18:47 - want to add to that
18:48 - as you were saying it's it's really a
18:50 - reality that you can go up to people and
18:52 - tell them something like hey
18:53 - you know what you're really good at
18:54 - coding how about you teach me a little
18:56 - bit of your secrets of what you do of
18:58 - how you learned yourself i want to
19:00 - i want to kind of be in the level that
19:01 - you're at you can kind of approach
19:03 - things like this
19:04 - and i would add that you know offer
19:06 - something to them so
19:07 - maybe be like you know please teach me
19:10 - the way that you code and i'll teach you
19:11 - how i do
19:12 - wireframing because i'm a very visual
19:14 - person and i see that you're very
19:15 - analytical
19:16 - so always try to bring something to the
19:18 - table don't just ask for something
19:20 - always try to bring value so that you
19:22 - know it can be an equivalent exchange
19:24 - and that in terms is going to build a
19:26 - huge and a very good relationship with
19:28 - the person that is mentoring you
19:31 - dude that's that's actually genius what
19:33 - you touched on like
19:34 - the whole um thing about the ui like i
19:37 - actually
19:38 - sucked at ui right so i could do
19:39 - front-end development but i was trash at
19:41 - ui
19:42 - and eventually what i did is i reached
19:43 - out to some guy who was the company i
19:45 - was working for
19:46 - and i went ahead and said to him i was
19:47 - like dude like i can code and he wanted
19:49 - to learn how to code and i was like i
19:51 - can code but
19:51 - my ui is terrible like do you mind just
19:54 - giving me a crash course on
19:55 - you know you know user interfaces and
19:56 - things like that and um
19:58 - that's actually how like i managed to
20:00 - start building apps like
20:01 - the clones that we built and how they
20:02 - start looking the way they did because
20:04 - yeah like that's a really really good
20:06 - point that you made there like honestly
20:07 - guys
20:08 - offer some kind of value and literally
20:10 - it's pretty much a no-brainer at that
20:11 - point like they're going to enjoy
20:12 - like they're going to get something from
20:14 - it you're going to get something for it
20:15 - that's
20:16 - that's completely awesome and i love
20:17 - that you have experience with that and
20:19 - that it was actually something similar
20:20 - and if you guys are enjoying this
20:22 - content do like the video
20:23 - you know right now we got i don't
20:25 - remember his name he's from silicon
20:27 - valley
20:27 - but you know talking about the mentor
20:29 - talking about the mentor context
20:31 - so i think that helps you know if you
20:32 - guys find this this content valuable
20:35 - actually like the video it helps us a
20:36 - lot it really does mean the world to us
20:38 - because
20:39 - this allows us to share it with a bunch
20:41 - of people like you
20:43 - so exactly guys like smash the thumbs up
20:46 - and if you're finding value in this like
20:48 - it's going to help someone else find
20:50 - value from this so if you guys are
20:52 - enjoying it you know what to do
20:54 - nice cool another another great thing
20:56 - about
20:58 - being able to develop your communication
21:00 - skills is actually writing
21:02 - so one of the biggest right now
21:04 - platforms of writing in the on the
21:06 - internet
21:06 - is medium so medium is really cool just
21:10 - because of the fact that it's so easy
21:12 - going like you just look at articles and
21:13 - you can see how long they are
21:14 - in minutes that that to me adds like
21:17 - such a human experience to it
21:19 - and so it makes me actually want to read
21:21 - articles and there's articles of
21:23 - all types of things whether it be
21:24 - business programming
21:26 - anything in general we've seen qazi
21:28 - actually put up a lot of medium articles
21:30 - on very specific tasks
21:32 - about business and programming so you
21:34 - know even for him he actually uses it as
21:36 - a note taking app
21:37 - in a way so you know instead of storing
21:40 - it on your computer
21:41 - you're actually storing it on the
21:42 - internet so then you just google it you
21:44 - know whatever it is that you're trying
21:45 - to look
21:46 - for that you already made on the past
21:48 - then you have access to it
21:51 - exactly and guys think of it this way
21:53 - right like in the morning
21:54 - if you spend let's say 20 to 30 minutes
21:57 - just watching a tv show where you have
21:58 - breakfast right
22:00 - like for example look at the article on
22:01 - the right that's a three minute read a
22:03 - lot of medium articles are three to five
22:04 - minutes long like in terms of read
22:06 - you could fit about four or five
22:08 - different articles in while you had your
22:10 - breakfast
22:11 - now imagine you do that in a week and in
22:13 - a month
22:14 - and in a year like you're going to
22:16 - accelerate your development
22:17 - so far is going to be ridiculous if you
22:20 - as compared to somebody
22:21 - who didn't open up their phone and just
22:23 - check out a few articles and guys like
22:24 - this is going to teach you
22:26 - not only like what's new in the
22:27 - development world it's also going to
22:29 - tell you like the good practices
22:31 - the like the the sort of the sort of
22:33 - experiences other people had so that
22:34 - maybe
22:35 - maybe you can avoid those same problems
22:37 - that they've made
22:38 - it's also going to make you a lot more
22:40 - like lit like um
22:42 - better when it comes to your writing
22:43 - abilities because you're going to be
22:44 - involved in a lot more reading and i was
22:46 - actually somebody who was late to this
22:47 - scene
22:48 - um and it was only until like kazi
22:49 - really i sort of started seeing him like
22:51 - write blog posts and things like that
22:53 - like that i actually saw the value in
22:55 - that so this is something which if i was
22:57 - being a software developer now i would
22:58 - 100
22:59 - be doing a lot more and think about it
23:02 - too you know
23:02 - if let's say you didn't go to college
23:05 - and you built your portfolio your
23:06 - portfolio is great
23:07 - imagine how good it looks to show that
23:10 - you've made so many articles on coding
23:12 - imagine the authority that it brings to
23:14 - you and imagine the impact that it
23:15 - brings to others
23:16 - not only to you but to others you know
23:18 - and so even that helps your career
23:20 - tons tons and helps distinguish
23:22 - distinguish you from the pack you know
23:24 - makes you very unique because you're
23:26 - providing value to the world
23:28 - in your own words literally
23:32 - exactly and that guys who are we kidding
23:33 - like a resume and a cv doesn't do it
23:35 - anymore
23:36 - you need more you need like a media
23:38 - models or a great way portfolios are a
23:40 - great way
23:40 - a great way like that's just going to
23:42 - help you stand out from the crowd
23:44 - definitely so now we're going to touch
23:46 - on our second point
23:47 - our second must-have skill to learn as a
23:50 - self-taught developer
23:52 - and that is yep learning
23:55 - how to learn guys like this is something
23:59 - like as soon as me and frankie both said
24:00 - it like we both were like yeah like this
24:02 - is something that has to be in here
24:03 - right
24:04 - like learning how to learn so frankie
24:06 - let's touch on the first point
24:08 - about uh finding your learning style
24:10 - what do what do you mean by that
24:11 - awesome so everybody really does have a
24:14 - different type of learning style
24:16 - and so i find myself to be a very audio
24:19 - person i like to hear things
24:20 - and i also like to see things so to me
24:22 - those are i think my strongest ones
24:24 - and right now we're gonna dive a little
24:26 - bit deeper into that some people are
24:28 - better
24:29 - you know learning with other people like
24:32 - through osmosis some people are better
24:34 - actually with tactile type of learning
24:36 - which is you know touching the actual
24:38 - thing
24:39 - some people are better just thinking
24:41 - about it logically
24:42 - you know so you do have to find the way
24:44 - that you learn
24:46 - yourself so that you can actually go go
24:48 - at this the long term because
24:50 - let's say you know it's taking you one
24:52 - week to learn something
24:54 - because you're trying to learn it by
24:56 - just listening to it instead of actually
24:57 - looking at it
24:58 - and by looking at it you'd probably you
25:00 - know learn
25:01 - in two to three days the difference the
25:03 - time difference is just
25:05 - massive so that is a huge huge deal
25:08 - what are you exactly and honestly guys
25:10 - like finding your style
25:13 - is going to mean all the difference
25:14 - between like spending
25:16 - an hour effectively versus like just
25:18 - sitting there just like bobbing your
25:19 - head and wondering why nothing's going
25:21 - in because like
25:22 - even reading books right i i always knew
25:24 - that yeah reading books is a good thing
25:26 - i just can't for some reason i can't
25:28 - concentrate that long on reading
25:30 - right so then i found audible and then
25:32 - literally when i would go for a walk i'd
25:33 - go for a jog or if i was doing like
25:35 - if i was at the gym like if i didn't
25:37 - want to listen to music i'll just stick
25:38 - on audible
25:39 - and i'll just listen to the book and i
25:40 - found that was really effective for me
25:43 - right and that actually was when i
25:44 - started to be like oh holy crap like i'm
25:46 - actually taking this stuff
25:47 - in and then i found i was also a visual
25:50 - sort of learner so like
25:51 - honestly finding your learning style is
25:53 - going to be a very very important step
25:55 - and it's the first step before you
25:57 - actually start even doing things
25:58 - that i would recommend that you guys go
26:00 - ahead and like try and try and identify
26:02 - what works for you
26:03 - and what has worked for in the past for
26:05 - you
26:06 - definitely definitely i think it's a
26:08 - huge thing you cannot ignore it
26:10 - so i think you know go go to it right
26:13 - away
26:13 - right away if you're learning something
26:15 - if you're trying to learn a huge skill
26:17 - like programming is that requires a lot
26:18 - of focus
26:19 - make sure you're learning the correct
26:20 - way for yourself
26:22 - now you want to touch on time management
26:24 - sony i think you're really really good
26:26 - at this so i think it would be perfect
26:28 - for you to
26:28 - tell us your experiences with it yeah so
26:32 - i remember when i was at university like
26:33 - somebody actually said to me
26:35 - um and this is like again like it's
26:37 - funny guys that we're actually doing a
26:39 - talk up today about why you don't need
26:40 - to be in the university and i can
26:42 - 100 vouch for that because i've been to
26:45 - university and i just it's not needed
26:47 - like it really isn't so save your money
26:49 - and and do this instead like um but like
26:51 - somebody at university anyway told me
26:53 - about a time management technique called
26:55 - pomodoro right now pomodoro is a small
26:57 - technique it's a very very simple thing
26:59 - that you can implement straight away
27:01 - and all it is is essentially you take
27:03 - take 20 minutes or 25 minute sessions
27:06 - right
27:06 - where you focus on nothing but the tasks
27:09 - that you're working on so let's say you
27:11 - are writing a medium article
27:12 - you're going to focus 100 of your
27:15 - attention
27:16 - towards that media market for 25 minutes
27:18 - then you have a quick five-minute break
27:19 - and
27:20 - in that five-minute break you do
27:21 - anything you want besides work
27:24 - whether i mean check your phone check
27:25 - your notifications go
27:27 - go to the toilet fill up your water
27:29 - wherever it is
27:30 - you do that in that five minutes right
27:31 - you do that four times and then you have
27:33 - a long break
27:34 - and you give yourself a bit like a half
27:35 - an hour hour um and guys it's so simple
27:37 - to implement
27:38 - and i promise you like once you just try
27:40 - it out like that you'll just see like oh
27:42 - my god i can get so much done in 25
27:45 - minutes
27:46 - that before was taking me an hour to do
27:48 - and um frankie have you used pomodoro
27:50 - technique
27:50 - i use it a lot i actually use it for
27:52 - editing because sometimes
27:54 - i feel like when you try to push
27:56 - creativity like
27:57 - creative work it sometimes doesn't work
27:59 - that well
28:00 - a lot of times it does a lot of times it
28:02 - doesn't so what i have to do is kind of
28:04 - get into the flow of pushing myself to
28:07 - just say
28:07 - okay i'm gonna work for 25 minutes or 35
28:11 - minutes
28:11 - and then give myself a 5 to 15 minute
28:14 - rest and when i do that
28:15 - and i do that multiple times let's say i
28:17 - do that for like two or three times
28:19 - that gets me in the flow of creativity
28:21 - and like it lets my ideas flow
28:23 - so i use it a lot for editing i use it a
28:25 - lot for
28:26 - when i'm doing very hard tasks because
28:28 - sometimes it's really hard
28:29 - just to sit down and focus like that and
28:31 - i wanted to ask you sonny because i know
28:32 - that you have your master's degree
28:34 - and did you ever use pomodoro because i
28:36 - know you know
28:37 - managing your time during you know
28:39 - academic things like this specifically
28:41 - something as hard as a masters degree in
28:42 - computer science
28:44 - you know you have to be very aware of
28:45 - how you spend your time and then your
28:47 - energy and your focus
28:48 - so can you tell us a little bit about
28:50 - that yeah so
28:52 - really good question so like two things
28:54 - here help me succeed with that so one
28:56 - was being
28:56 - understanding that i was actually a
28:58 - visual learner so i ended up actually
29:00 - literally i surrounded my entire room
29:02 - with like pieces of paper with like
29:04 - notes and different colors and stuff
29:05 - like that because
29:06 - that worked for me and like it would
29:09 - force me
29:10 - like as i walked into my room as i left
29:11 - my room to stare at that piece of
29:13 - information day in day out
29:15 - and what i would end up doing is that's
29:16 - the first point right that was the first
29:18 - point was understanding my learning
29:19 - style
29:19 - the second one was the pomodoro
29:21 - technique actually like a lot of us
29:23 - suffer from procrastination so i do big
29:26 - time
29:26 - frankie do you suffer from
29:27 - procrastination yo i'm the king of
29:29 - procrastination man it's insane
29:33 - like literally you open up netflix and
29:35 - before you know it you're like five
29:36 - episodes into game of thrones and like
29:37 - five hours of your life and you're never
29:39 - gonna get that back right
29:40 - so instead i literally when i found
29:42 - pomodoro i was like oh okay
29:44 - like 25 minutes no is it really long
29:46 - enough for me to get anything done
29:48 - and like before you know it i was like
29:49 - crushing it i was all of my work was
29:51 - getting done
29:52 - i had so much more free time and it blew
29:55 - my mind because like you can literally
29:56 - actually spend
29:57 - a lot more time doing the things you
29:59 - enjoy because you're actually
30:00 - focused when you're doing what you're
30:02 - doing and guys i forgot who said this
30:04 - but like
30:04 - when you're eating right you are eating
30:06 - so focus on eating
30:08 - enjoy the food like enjoy what you're
30:09 - doing when you're coding you're coding
30:11 - so like focus on that
30:12 - but don't worry about other things or
30:14 - don't have your mind elsewhere because
30:16 - like when you are literally like
30:17 - concentrating and focus 100 on a task
30:21 - you should just be thinking about that
30:22 - task like if you know that you need to
30:23 - go and get food later on
30:25 - that's a that's a that's a task for
30:26 - later on right give your 100 attention
30:29 - in that 25 minute session
30:30 - and then when you get that long break
30:31 - then you go and get your food that's
30:33 - exactly right
30:35 - that that's a very zen-like type of
30:38 - teaching very like buddhist like type of
30:39 - teaching
30:40 - and it really does remind me of our next
30:42 - point which is
30:43 - you know learn how to handle stress and
30:46 - anxiety
30:47 - and one of the big things that you can
30:48 - do is actually meditation
30:51 - so i know sunny you like to play a lot
30:53 - of meditation music while you're doing
30:54 - your coding and everything
30:55 - can you tell us a little bit more about
30:57 - that what type of practices you use yeah
30:59 - what helps you so i actually use this as
31:02 - well while i was studying a lot so i
31:03 - used
31:04 - an app called so i did try and do it off
31:06 - youtube and i really didn't find like a
31:08 - lot of success in it because
31:10 - i just didn't the truth is guys it is a
31:12 - skill to meditate like it is
31:14 - something which you need to practice and
31:16 - you need to build like an endurance for
31:17 - being able to like sit there and
31:18 - meditate and
31:19 - actually try and clear your head is
31:20 - quite hard um so i used an
31:23 - app called headspace and i'd really
31:25 - really recommend it
31:26 - uh you can get on the app store android
31:28 - and ios and basically it's an app and
31:30 - you pay a monthly subscription and all
31:31 - you basically do
31:32 - is just follow the steps in that
31:34 - headspace and before you know it i was
31:35 - doing
31:36 - from 10 minute sessions to 30 minute
31:37 - sessions and why this was so good guys
31:40 - is for one reason it just gave me
31:42 - clarity it gave me clarity on my life
31:44 - like it gave me a carry on what i wanted
31:46 - to focus on
31:47 - it gave me that clarity as to what i was
31:48 - sort of stressed out about or things
31:50 - like that
31:50 - and whenever i feel that life kind of
31:52 - goes a bit haywire and crazy
31:54 - i just kind of turned to meditation and
31:56 - it really kind of
31:57 - serves as like an anchor and pulls me
31:59 - back in and um
32:00 - when i joined the clever programming
32:02 - team i found it amazing because frankie
32:03 - is actually all about meditation right
32:06 - so like frankie like what's yours how
32:07 - was your journey and like how did you
32:09 - get into meditation what are the
32:10 - benefits that you found from it
32:12 - and why do you like teach other people
32:13 - how to meditate
32:15 - man meditation to me was just insane
32:18 - when i learned meditation
32:19 - it was uh it was a way for me to
32:21 - actually i made it very practical for
32:23 - myself and i feel like that's the reason
32:25 - why i went very deep into it so for
32:26 - example
32:27 - one of the ways that i used it in
32:29 - specifically in programming
32:30 - i used to actually program android apps
32:33 - and the way i was actually telling sunny
32:35 - this
32:35 - the way that i would think about ui
32:37 - designs you know it's a very big
32:38 - it's a very known thing to think about
32:40 - your ui design in the way
32:42 - and how many clicks it takes to get to a
32:44 - certain menu to take to a certain action
32:46 - and things like that
32:47 - so i would literally visualize in my
32:49 - head you know how many clicks would it
32:51 - take me to
32:52 - get to you know i was thinking of
32:54 - developing a meditation app actually
32:56 - a binaural beat app so an app that you
32:58 - can actually listen to different type of
33:00 - brain waves
33:01 - and you know these brain waves get you
33:03 - to different types of thinking or
33:05 - mind spaces or whatever and i feel like
33:07 - you know like you mentioned headspace is
33:09 - actually a very good app that you want
33:10 - to use if you want to start meditating
33:12 - right now
33:13 - headspace is actually a tech company
33:14 - it's actually a billion dollar company
33:16 - right now who would have thought that
33:17 - meditation is that oh
33:18 - yeah it's a billion so who would have
33:21 - thought you know meditation is
33:22 - that popular man and yeah like i was
33:24 - saying the way that i used meditation
33:26 - was to visualize
33:28 - you know my journey around my ui design
33:32 - so i could literally design in my head
33:35 - and then i could put it into code so for
33:37 - me it was it was a very practical way to
33:39 - use it
33:40 - as well as you know stress and anxiety
33:42 - which is a huge part of coding
33:44 - when you're debugging when you cannot
33:47 - think of the right function to call
33:49 - all of these things man people don't
33:51 - normally you
33:52 - take that into account the psychological
33:54 - factors of coding
33:55 - but it's such a huge thing and i would
33:59 - really recommend everybody to go into
34:00 - meditation and start that
34:03 - exactly and you know what like it's a
34:04 - really good point you touched on like
34:06 - when it comes to coding guys
34:07 - when especially when you're self-taught
34:09 - and you're in that early part of your
34:10 - journey right
34:11 - how many of you guys can relate to this
34:13 - and like throw in the comments let us
34:14 - know like
34:15 - i have always used to feel that sort of
34:18 - pressure of like
34:18 - am i clever enough to code or like am i
34:21 - really like
34:22 - am i doing enough like i'm am i like am
34:24 - i cut out for this
34:26 - and like the truth is that guys like i
34:28 - wish like i just knew the answer to that
34:30 - like earlier on and the truth is guys
34:32 - it's completely normal and i've spoken
34:34 - to the most senior developers like the
34:35 - most skilled developers
34:37 - and it's something which is a normal way
34:39 - to fill and
34:40 - every single coder feels it trust me and
34:43 - like
34:43 - this is why it's a really important
34:44 - point meditation is going to help you
34:46 - control that stress and anxiety which is
34:48 - why we felt it
34:49 - had a place in this list we have a
34:51 - comment by a7gr
34:54 - it says hey sunny sub dude just want to
34:56 - confirm today
34:57 - these guys are crazy like they are doing
34:59 - a live streaming here
35:01 - while other coaches with nas are in a
35:03 - live coaching call
35:05 - just enroll in pwj so it's crazy man
35:09 - right now there's there's another call
35:12 - with the pwj group and nas is leading it
35:15 - so
35:15 - i mean that's the way that we do here we
35:17 - try to provide a lot of value to you
35:19 - guys
35:19 - we really push ourselves to our limits
35:21 - and you know it helps us grow so much
35:23 - and
35:24 - at the same time bringing that much
35:25 - value to you guys so we're really
35:27 - blessed we're really
35:28 - grateful for being able to provide that
35:30 - for you guys please drop it in the
35:31 - comments below if you guys are liking it
35:33 - and if you do
35:33 - like the video because like i said it
35:35 - helps us a ton
35:37 - exactly and also that's ahmed from the
35:39 - course what's up dude
35:41 - nice awesome so one of the biggest
35:45 - things
35:45 - as well that we can do as a developer
35:48 - and
35:48 - one of the biggest skills in you know
35:50 - learning how to learn is your ability to
35:52 - google
35:55 - this is huge dude this is so big and
35:57 - it's off every
35:58 - for some reason it's off every single
36:00 - list right like
36:01 - there's a really funny meme on the next
36:03 - slide this let's go check that one out
36:05 - and like
36:05 - guys this is the most like relatable
36:08 - meme on the internet right
36:09 - like it doesn't matter if you have 10
36:11 - years of experience when you code or
36:13 - if you're fresh like uh and you're just
36:15 - beginning a development journey
36:17 - like you are going to have to master the
36:20 - skill of googling right
36:21 - to this day people think like you just
36:23 - memorize this stuff like honestly the
36:25 - truth is
36:26 - you get yeah there is pattern
36:27 - recognition you do so you do seem to
36:29 - like
36:29 - um remember things through repetition
36:31 - and sort of you know like repeating code
36:33 - but the truth is that i don't remember
36:35 - how to write certain kinds of functions
36:36 - i mean i always forget this stuff or is
36:38 - it better that
36:39 - or is it that you become better at
36:41 - googling you know
36:43 - exactly you know how much like imposter
36:46 - syndrome is a thing
36:47 - like it's actually a thing it's like
36:50 - we're not sure if we're actually good
36:51 - developers or are we getting good
36:52 - yeah we love this meme yeah
36:56 - so good and like truthfully like the
36:58 - ability to google is going to
37:00 - benefit you massively yeah drop in the
37:03 - comments below if you've ever watched
37:04 - futurama because that's where we got
37:06 - this meme
37:07 - so hey moving forward like i was saying
37:10 - the learning styles is a very important
37:12 - thing that you need to dive into because
37:14 - like i said different people learn
37:16 - different ways so some people
37:18 - you know learn the bodily and
37:20 - kinesthetic way which is
37:21 - being more aware of your body some
37:23 - people are very good you know building
37:25 - things with their hands
37:26 - building tools building desks all of
37:28 - these things some people are very
37:30 - smart being interpersonal like actually
37:33 - you know
37:33 - communicating with others conveying
37:35 - their ideas with others working with
37:36 - the team some people are good at just a
37:38 - verbal language and speaking trying to
37:41 - articulate what they're saying with
37:42 - words they're very good cause he's huge
37:44 - at that i feel
37:45 - logic he's very logic as well i feel
37:48 - like i'm not so strong in the logic
37:49 - sense i think i can be but i'm
37:51 - definitely more
37:52 - visual i'm definitely more audio and
37:55 - actually i say this spatial too visual
37:58 - and spatial what do you think you are
38:00 - sonny
38:02 - you know it's a good question i feel
38:04 - like i
38:05 - i'm very like i'm a very i'm very visual
38:07 - right like i feel like i'm quite a logic
38:09 - logical person i like to break problems
38:11 - down and sort of go from there
38:12 - i feel like i am quite interpersonal i
38:14 - like to be around people but
38:16 - very recently i noticed i'm quite kind
38:18 - of uh i don't know how you say can
38:20 - can mistake like i like to be active
38:22 - right if i
38:23 - if i'm not active literally to the point
38:25 - where sometimes i'll jump on a call and
38:26 - me and qazi would just go for a walk so
38:28 - he'll go for a walk in l.a i'll go for a
38:30 - walk in london
38:30 - and we'll just talk because like just
38:32 - being out and being able to walk around
38:34 - like and this and that like
38:35 - it it's just it somewhat connects your
38:38 - brain like a bit differently like
38:40 - and even like they're like going and
38:41 - training every day or something like
38:43 - that
38:43 - it allows me to sort of clear my mind
38:45 - get back on and kind of align and like
38:47 - it doesn't work for everyone but for me
38:49 - it's a big deal
38:50 - yeah definitely definitely you have to
38:52 - dial that in guys
38:54 - know what your learning style is dial
38:56 - that in and
38:57 - go all in so now we're going to touch on
39:00 - different ways that you can learn to
39:02 - code so one of the most important things
39:03 - that you can actually
39:04 - research for yourself is coding
39:06 - resources especially
39:08 - if you're being a self-taught developer
39:10 - this is going to be gold for you
39:12 - so can you tell us a little bit more
39:13 - about these examples honey
39:14 - [Music]
39:16 - yeah so guys like honestly if you're in
39:17 - the beginning of your journey these are
39:19 - going to be
39:19 - huge for you so honestly the first one
39:22 - which isn't even on this list is youtube
39:24 - so firstly well done if you're here
39:26 - because this is like a first step in
39:27 - like using a free coding resource like
39:29 - it's going to be something which like
39:31 - you will help you grow and it's going to
39:33 - help you sort of like better your skills
39:34 - as a developer
39:35 - um these ones as well so on this list we
39:37 - have code academy khan academy
39:39 - code avengers that's interesting
39:41 - treehouse is quite popular so these are
39:42 - all places guys where they offer a lot
39:44 - of free content they do have paid
39:46 - courses on there
39:47 - but if you're just getting started off
39:48 - you don't have to stress about like you
39:50 - know setting up your development
39:51 - environment they just kind of have
39:52 - everything laid out and i'd recommend
39:54 - that you do go and check them out and
39:56 - just go ahead and play with them get
39:57 - started as a developer and sort of get
39:59 - the basic fundamentals
40:01 - going with using these things because
40:02 - these are built and they've researched
40:04 - the best ways to get it as easy as
40:06 - possible for you to get started
40:07 - so these are going to be really really
40:09 - good resources to go ahead and get
40:11 - started with
40:12 - w3schools is another really good one
40:14 - it's not on this list as well but that's
40:15 - really good
40:16 - yeah definitely so that's why i say you
40:18 - have to dial in your
40:20 - actual style of learning because because
40:22 - each company does have a different style
40:24 - of teaching as well you know here in
40:25 - clever programmer we try to keep things
40:27 - very fun very engaged
40:29 - so if that's your style of learning you
40:31 - know do
40:32 - actually join one of the courses that we
40:34 - have here we even have free courses we
40:36 - have paid courses
40:36 - everything i'd say you know whether it's
40:39 - our company or any other company
40:41 - you know put a little bit of skin in the
40:42 - game and actually if you
40:44 - deeply want to learn this skill pay for
40:46 - it because once you pay for something it
40:48 - just makes it that much more serious you
40:50 - know
40:50 - if you're just getting free content your
40:53 - whole life
40:54 - it's going to be very hard for you to
40:55 - dive super deep into you know
40:57 - an eight-hour tutorial 11-hour tutorial
40:59 - 12-hour tutorial
41:00 - that you have to follow just because you
41:03 - know but if you actually paid for it man
41:05 - you're gonna want to have that roi back
41:07 - so you know even that is leverage
41:09 - even even knowing that you learn with a
41:11 - little bit of pressure
41:13 - on your on your belly on your back you
41:14 - know makes you
41:17 - learn that much more it makes you
41:18 - understand that that can be your style
41:20 - of learning as well
41:22 - exactly and guys this is something which
41:24 - i would really like
41:26 - add on to what frankie said that like
41:28 - really really do
41:29 - like focus on like investing in yourself
41:32 - like if i asked you today like
41:34 - would you pay like 500 to go on holiday
41:37 - like
41:38 - most people would say hell yeah like
41:39 - where we going to fly to you right but
41:41 - if i said to you
41:42 - would you pay 500 in yourself to
41:44 - literally change your life so that you
41:46 - can make more money and go on as many
41:48 - holidays as you want
41:49 - then it becomes a completely different
41:51 - question right and most people will be
41:52 - like oh
41:53 - i don't really know but then they want
41:55 - the end result right so remember what we
41:57 - said in the beginning focus on your end
41:58 - goal
41:59 - first and then figure out how to get
42:01 - there right so in this case
42:03 - investing in yourself is going to be one
42:04 - of the most crucial things that you can
42:06 - do
42:06 - and like guys we do offer a course
42:08 - called profit with javascript which fits
42:09 - in here perfectly
42:11 - um and it does teach you a lot of things
42:12 - so i would recommend you use the code
42:14 - the free resources out there
42:16 - on the channel we have a bunch of free
42:18 - stuff on um which will literally help
42:20 - you get started and and get going
42:22 - and then if you do feel like you want to
42:23 - take it to the next level
42:25 - be sure to check out profit with
42:26 - javascript there is a link in the
42:27 - description if you guys want to go check
42:29 - it out um
42:30 - and pretty much yeah you can pretty much
42:32 - go from beginner
42:33 - all the way to your end end goal like we
42:36 - spoke about in the beginning
42:37 - definitely man even adding to what you
42:39 - said about investing in yourself i feel
42:41 - like that
42:41 - actually is a habit and once you start
42:44 - doing that more and more and more
42:45 - it's like you're actually betting on
42:47 - yourself you're actually believing in
42:49 - yourself so
42:50 - you start kind of framing your mind in a
42:51 - certain sense that
42:53 - now you believe that you will take
42:55 - action on the things that you do that
42:57 - now
42:57 - you're actually gonna bet on yourself
43:00 - because
43:00 - you do see yourself following through
43:03 - all the way
43:04 - and i feel like that's that's a huge an
43:06 - important point to touch if you're gonna
43:07 - be a self-taught programmer
43:09 - another big point that i do want to
43:10 - touch on is actually
43:12 - optimizing your workflow because you
43:15 - know if you don't want to be the most
43:16 - productive that you can be with the time
43:17 - that you have you know
43:19 - everybody has 24 hours in a day the only
43:21 - difference is everybody manages their
43:23 - time different
43:23 - and so if you're able to actually you
43:26 - know work with the specific tools that
43:28 - can help you
43:29 - either you know make your workflow
43:31 - faster either
43:32 - share what you're doing with your team
43:34 - or you know just
43:35 - moving files around these are some of
43:37 - the tools that we ourselves in clever
43:39 - programmer as a team
43:40 - internally use can you explain some of
43:42 - these sonny
43:44 - yeah so it's an interesting story so
43:45 - frankie and the guys got me started with
43:47 - a bunch of these tools so i wasn't
43:49 - actually using alfred before i was using
43:50 - spotlight just
43:51 - the built-in apple thing um and like
43:54 - alfred is the middle guy with the hat so
43:55 - it's actually
43:56 - uh i only found out today the reason why
43:58 - it's called alfred
43:59 - is why frankie it's funny it's funny i
44:02 - told yeah i told him today um
44:04 - and i actually saw the name and i'm like
44:06 - wow isn't that batman's butler
44:08 - and yeah that's everything that's right
44:09 - what it is
44:11 - yeah man and i was like so cool because
44:13 - like go ahead
44:14 - yeah i was just gonna say because
44:17 - literally because alfred guys it's like
44:19 - it's so
44:19 - powerful like literally to the point
44:21 - where there's a really handy feature on
44:23 - alfred
44:24 - where i've got it hooked up to command
44:26 - spacebar so it literally pops up on the
44:27 - screen
44:28 - but i if you like on alfred if you pay
44:30 - for the sort of booster pack which is
44:31 - only i think it's like 10
44:33 - or something but like once you have that
44:35 - literally every time you copy
44:37 - like a piece of text right it will
44:39 - literally keep track of
44:40 - like the last three months worth of your
44:42 - copied contents
44:43 - which is huge i can literally never have
44:45 - to like remember things anymore
44:47 - it's insane yeah man i love that like
44:50 - even if you're
44:51 - you know you have a snippet of code that
44:53 - you need to paste
44:54 - for another project even if you know
44:56 - you're trying to get a specific line of
44:58 - code or even a comment or even
45:00 - you know anything a password or really
45:03 - you know
45:04 - a url link something like that utm
45:06 - parameters like we use a lot in our team
45:08 - you know all of these things are stored
45:10 - there for even three months or even
45:12 - i think even more man but to me that's
45:14 - one of the most handiest tools for sure
45:16 - alfred yeah definitely the next one is
45:20 - so the one on the right is really good
45:22 - it's something called yoink
45:23 - uh so it's y-o-i-n-k and the reason why
45:26 - this one's really cool guys it's
45:27 - literally like it should be built into
45:29 - mac like because it is all like even
45:30 - windows because it's so handy
45:32 - it's like a little thing that pops up on
45:33 - the side and you can just hold some
45:35 - files in there and then you can pull
45:36 - them out as you need them
45:37 - so definitely if you're interested check
45:39 - that out because the whole team uses
45:40 - your ink
45:42 - loom is a cool one for making really
45:44 - interactive videos
45:45 - very fast so there's no editing you just
45:47 - hit the record button and then you have
45:48 - a little pop-up with your face in there
45:50 - from the webcam and then you can just
45:51 - sort of talk through your code that's
45:53 - really good guys even for applying to
45:55 - job interviews
45:56 - because what's really cool like is you
45:57 - could send a resume to a company right
45:59 - but if you send a personalized
46:01 - loom video going through their website
46:04 - saying hey i checked out your website
46:05 - and
46:06 - it's really cool really amazing like i
46:08 - love all this stuff this is what i can
46:09 - do
46:10 - hey why don't you check out some work go
46:11 - through your work on a loom video
46:13 - like that immediately sets you up from
46:15 - the crowd like it immediately just makes
46:17 - you different
46:18 - it makes you sort of somebody who
46:19 - they're gonna actually pay a little bit
46:20 - more attention to because they've gone
46:22 - out of your way to do that
46:23 - the final one which isn't on here guys
46:25 - is actually um
46:27 - setting up your coding environment so a
46:29 - lot of people
46:30 - use something called visual studio we
46:32 - use visual studio code to actually
46:34 - get coding and get up and running guys
46:36 - personalize it optimize it to be
46:38 - like your playground because that's
46:40 - where you're going to spend all your
46:41 - time learning
46:42 - right so prettier is a really good
46:43 - extension i'd recommend vs live share
46:46 - so you compare program with people is
46:47 - amazing me and qazi
46:49 - me and uh and aaron and kazzy like
46:51 - literally everyone on the on the team
46:53 - has used vs code liveshare
46:54 - to pair program like in a google doc
46:56 - right um
46:57 - there's so many handy plugins and stuff
46:59 - like that because optimize it so that
47:01 - you have fun
47:02 - while you do it and i can see a lot of
47:03 - questions about like how can i stay
47:05 - motivated how can i
47:07 - like keep like how can i keep my
47:08 - motivation levels higher like mohammed
47:10 - dawud hamid
47:11 - asked how do i stay motivated to code
47:13 - and guys truthfully motivation
47:15 - and this is something which i think
47:16 - frankie would agree on like motivation
47:18 - will always come down right
47:20 - like there's going to be like when you
47:21 - start your journey motivation is going
47:22 - to be skyrocketed it's going to be so
47:24 - high
47:25 - but like your discipline is what you
47:27 - have to focus on and build
47:29 - right and like building that is going to
47:32 - be your crucial thing
47:33 - as to succeeding as a self-taught
47:34 - developer but your motivation
47:37 - like what sort of a little hack i use to
47:39 - keep my motivation high is just make my
47:41 - whole workflow fun
47:42 - like if your workflow is fun you enjoy
47:44 - what you do and if you enjoy what you do
47:46 - it's easy to do
47:48 - man if you're playing the long term game
47:50 - you definitely have to make it a little
47:51 - bit pleasant for you because
47:53 - if you're feeling discomfort all the
47:55 - time it's gonna be
47:56 - it's gonna obstruct you from actually
47:58 - you know getting the things done
48:00 - like you want them to so you know
48:02 - actually
48:03 - making your workspace flow a little bit
48:06 - better
48:07 - it's gonna save years not even just that
48:10 - just your emotion your energy is gonna
48:13 - go through the roof
48:14 - so that's a huge point that we like to
48:16 - touch here and one of the last tools
48:18 - that we forgot to touch on
48:20 - is actually rocket and this is rocket
48:23 - this is for mac there's obviously
48:25 - equivalents for windows as well rocket
48:27 - is cool because i feel like it gives a
48:28 - very human
48:30 - touch to text you know we're talking in
48:32 - computers a lot so if you're able to put
48:34 - emojis here and there it actually
48:36 - conveys a lot of you know data just
48:38 - visually
48:39 - in text so that's an addition to it
48:41 - definitely
48:43 - yeah rocky guys just to be clear is a
48:45 - way of just adding emojis into your text
48:47 - in a really like easy way so you just do
48:49 - colon and then you get like
48:50 - you type in what you want and it'll pop
48:51 - an emoji on the screen so really really
48:53 - human sort of thing which actually makes
48:55 - a big difference when you're
48:56 - you're doing a lot of sort of people to
48:58 - people conversations
49:00 - yeah we use it with our ads we use it
49:01 - when we're taking notes that we share
49:03 - internally on the team all of this
49:05 - this takes me to actually another big
49:07 - part of learning to learn
49:09 - is gonna be a huge huge huge thing for
49:12 - programming in general for programming
49:14 - interviews for
49:16 - literally the academic side of
49:17 - programming and that is going to be
49:20 - data structures and algorithms guys so
49:23 - data structures in my opinion are the
49:25 - ones that you should focus a lot of your
49:27 - time around because it's
49:28 - practically what is going to be
49:30 - important for
49:31 - most scenarios but if you do want to
49:34 - kind of go the route of sort of going
49:35 - for like fine companies like google
49:37 - netflix
49:38 - amazon they are going to test you on
49:41 - algorithms because it's all about
49:42 - optimization and efficient efficiency
49:45 - so like that's like binary search three
49:46 - algorithms that sort of stuff
49:48 - now me personally i actually don't dive
49:51 - too far into algorithms i kind of just
49:53 - focus on
49:54 - mastering data structures and what i
49:55 - need in what situations
49:57 - frankie what's your thoughts on this
49:58 - like data structures versus algorithms
50:00 - yeah man data structures really do
50:02 - dictate the way that you're gonna code
50:04 - so for example if you're thinking about
50:06 - maybe you know searching through a list
50:09 - that you don't want any repetitions you
50:10 - might use a hash map if you're using
50:12 - java
50:13 - or you know if you're trying to traverse
50:16 - through a linked list
50:17 - and you know you're going to through a
50:19 - list then you might want to use a
50:21 - certain
50:22 - type of algorithm that i don't know it
50:24 - can be like a dividing conquer algorithm
50:26 - or something related to that but really
50:28 - you know the data structure that you use
50:29 - is going to dictate the code
50:30 - that you're going to use it's it gives
50:32 - that's why it's called data structure
50:34 - because it is the structure of data you
50:36 - know at the end of the
50:39 - i day never dove too too deep into this
50:42 - to these two categories the farthest
50:45 - that i learned is really traversing
50:46 - through linked lists and actually
50:48 - you know binary trees and seeing how
50:51 - algorithms work
50:51 - they're actually not as hard as people
50:53 - make him out to be and they're actually
50:55 - very very visual and it's what a lot of
50:57 - people don't sometimes pick up
51:00 - yeah and just to sort of pop a bubble
51:02 - here like
51:03 - guys it's like a big elephant in the
51:05 - room whenever we mention the word
51:06 - algorithms because whenever i used to
51:08 - algorithms i was like oh algorithm
51:09 - sounds cool it's like i want to learn
51:10 - how to use like
51:11 - make algorithms or write algorithms all
51:13 - algorithms are
51:15 - are a sequence of steps literally if
51:18 - it's like if you need to go to the shop
51:19 - it's like
51:20 - like open the front door walk out go to
51:22 - go inside the car put the keys inside
51:23 - the car
51:24 - it's literally steps that you're going
51:26 - to follow right same for the computer
51:27 - like i said it's a series of steps that
51:29 - you're telling the computer
51:30 - and then that's how you you're going to
51:32 - get it moving and then obviously you're
51:33 - getting
51:34 - different levels of complexity there but
51:35 - don't over complicate and honestly like
51:37 - don't freak out like we said
51:38 - focus on the data structure stuff until
51:41 - you really need
51:42 - the algorithm section stuff like because
51:44 - honestly even in my experience i haven't
51:46 - actually found too much of a need for it
51:47 - yeah
51:48 - so i would if if you want to sort of
51:50 - know from experience i would say focus
51:52 - more on
51:52 - the data structures um and that brings
51:54 - us on to the
51:55 - next point which is huge and i think
51:57 - it's one of the biggest talking points
51:59 - and that is
52:00 - what frankie it is debugging debugging
52:03 - actually debugging is might be one of
52:05 - the biggest biggest things in
52:07 - programming and it actually
52:09 - we were talking about this sunny and
52:10 - it's in my opinion one of the
52:12 - ways that you learn the best because
52:14 - you're actually troubleshooting your
52:15 - code
52:16 - you know you're realizing the you're
52:18 - back you're backtracking the steps that
52:20 - you did
52:21 - you're like okay this is connected to
52:23 - this if i delete this then this is going
52:25 - to happen
52:26 - and then you know it kind of gives you a
52:28 - whole symbiotic
52:29 - process of your code you know what is
52:31 - your take on exactly
52:34 - i couldn't agree more like guys like
52:35 - this is where like it's one of those
52:37 - things that
52:38 - you kind of have to like have
52:40 - conversations with developers and sort
52:42 - of understand that like
52:43 - it's a normal thing right it's one it's
52:45 - a normal thing and two
52:46 - it's literally the place where i
52:48 - probably learn the most when i'm
52:49 - debugging when things break
52:51 - is when i learn the most and like one
52:53 - thing i will really just need to address
52:55 - straight off the bat is i get a lot of
52:57 - like messages from like students and
52:59 - people who are
53:00 - who are sort of following our live
53:01 - streams which is basically about they're
53:03 - getting stuck
53:04 - and then they they spend like an hour or
53:06 - two debugging right
53:07 - guys be prepared when it comes to this
53:10 - and you just have to like be prepared
53:11 - for this like
53:12 - be prepared to spend hours and hours
53:14 - debugging or like even if it takes it
53:16 - like days i've spent a week
53:17 - fixing a problem before but i'll tell
53:19 - you one thing like when you
53:21 - you like when you solve that problem i
53:24 - can
53:24 - promise you that same issue will not
53:27 - bother you again in the future like
53:29 - because you would have spent
53:30 - hours and hours and days and days and
53:32 - that's literally where it
53:33 - really ingrains into your head as to
53:36 - what what was it that
53:38 - how did you fix it how did you identify
53:40 - the problem how did you sort of do it
53:41 - and these are things which
53:42 - then they can't always be taught you
53:44 - kind of have to go through that element
53:46 - of sort of like
53:47 - sitting there and banging your head
53:48 - against the keyboard but it's a normal
53:50 - process guys
53:51 - so like uh frankie what would you say is
53:53 - to like to answer those people who are
53:55 - like i can't code for like eight hours
53:57 - or
53:58 - like you know like you hear about these
53:59 - developers like even when we do live
54:01 - streams we're coding for five to six
54:02 - like five six hours at a time like a lot
54:05 - of people sort of
54:06 - they saw want to do that off the bat is
54:08 - that realistic
54:09 - not at all man it is like everything
54:11 - else in life any skill that you do want
54:13 - to learn you have to build that stamina
54:15 - and that endurance it's like running i
54:17 - love running myself
54:18 - i'm a huge fan of running just because
54:20 - of the psychological benefits that i see
54:22 - of it
54:22 - and really you know it's crazy man
54:25 - because
54:26 - stamina is so related to the consistency
54:28 - of the the consistency
54:30 - that you have that because at the end of
54:32 - the day for example if i stop running
54:34 - for three days just three days
54:35 - man it's gonna be very hard for me to
54:37 - run three miles but if i'm running every
54:39 - day
54:40 - like let's say today i ran three miles
54:41 - next day i can run five miles next day i
54:43 - can run eight miles
54:44 - but if i stop running even two days if i
54:47 - run five miles then the next day
54:49 - the three miles are gonna feel even more
54:51 - than the five miles so
54:52 - it's the same way with coding man it's
54:54 - you know if you are not used to coding
54:56 - for long hours and you wanna code for
54:58 - four hours straight your brain is gonna
54:59 - be a little bit fried so you're gonna
55:01 - have to take breaks in between
55:02 - and you're gonna have to build up to
55:03 - that exactly and it's all about the
55:06 - consistency at that point like
55:08 - focus on consistency as opposed to like
55:11 - spending
55:11 - hours and hours and hours at a time like
55:13 - the hours will come guys like
55:15 - having all night coding sessions that
55:16 - stuff naturally like sort of starts to
55:18 - happen when you sort of just like like
55:20 - frankie said like
55:21 - stick it consistently and day by day
55:23 - you'll notice that growth and you'll
55:24 - notice that you can spend longer
55:26 - debugging
55:27 - but it is one of those things which like
55:28 - naturally in the beginning it's one of
55:30 - those more painful processes but it's
55:32 - the most valuable thing because
55:34 - you will never stop debugging and that's
55:35 - the truth you will never stop debugging
55:37 - so
55:37 - you might as well get really good at it
55:39 - and that's going to really help your
55:40 - journey as especially as a self-taught
55:42 - developer
55:43 - um and and how you learn and uh this is
55:45 - this leads us on to the next point guys
55:47 - like
55:48 - debugging is one of those scary like
55:50 - processes right it's a scary process
55:51 - because sometimes you can feel like
55:53 - you're just hitting a wall and you can't
55:55 - overcome it so the one thing we would
55:57 - recommend
55:57 - is actually get inside of some kind of
56:00 - community right
56:01 - whether that would be stack overflow
56:04 - whether that be youtube or something but
56:05 - like get inside the community
56:07 - and this is where like we have an
56:08 - amazing like i just feel like there's
56:10 - like i just i'm yet to see a community
56:13 - which touches like profit with
56:14 - javascript because like we have 1
56:16 - 300 plus people and it's growing every
56:18 - day and like guys like
56:20 - if you get stuck in profit javascript
56:23 - like i i literally i can't even respond
56:25 - as quickly as some of the people jump in
56:27 - and help out a student or like
56:28 - it's amazing and like frankie you've
56:30 - seen this firsthand as well right like
56:31 - what's your thoughts on that
56:32 - man it's incredible to begin with 1 300
56:35 - people in a slack community that are
56:38 - super
56:39 - duper active like wow it's like having a
56:41 - village having a whole village of
56:43 - developers
56:44 - inside of one specific platform the
56:46 - thing is the most
56:47 - interesting part about it is that
56:48 - everybody has a similar
56:50 - goal everybody has a similar path and so
56:53 - once you're around people that actually
56:55 - you know
56:56 - are looking to go the same way it just
56:58 - it has this magnetizing feeling to
57:01 - towards you know moving to your goal it
57:03 - you see other people getting
57:04 - you know getting a job getting actual
57:06 - results and you're like
57:08 - that person could do it i can do it too
57:10 - i mean i talk to him a lot i actually
57:12 - know how he works i mean i think i can
57:14 - be in that skill level too as well so
57:16 - it's actually very motivational to be in
57:18 - a community like this
57:19 - it's huge man if you do want to stay and
57:22 - be a self-taught developer on the long
57:24 - term
57:24 - play the long term game you have to have
57:27 - to have to look for a community that
57:29 - works for you
57:31 - yeah and truth be told like i'm yet to
57:33 - find something like that
57:35 - like which is why prophet javascript
57:37 - jumped out to me because i was one of
57:38 - those people who guys like we've all
57:40 - been there we're scared to kind of write
57:42 - into that stack overflow that i'm stuck
57:44 - on something because
57:45 - stack overflow makes you feel so dumb
57:47 - sometimes especially when you're
57:48 - learning in your journey
57:50 - like it's one of those places where
57:51 - somebody will come out like you you'll
57:52 - write a comment saying i'm stuck on this
57:53 - and you literally have
57:55 - five developers tell you like you're a
57:56 - piece of like yeah man
57:58 - like literally yeah they're like shoot
58:01 - you down
58:02 - exactly like they'll just let you like
58:04 - go at you like so like
58:05 - we do recommend like if you guys are
58:07 - interested it's the first link in the
58:09 - description go and check it out because
58:11 - like
58:11 - if you if you have run into any of those
58:14 - problems that we sort of mentioned
58:15 - like we can promise you like we fixed
58:18 - that in profit with javascript like we
58:20 - we
58:20 - this is like the reason why most of like
58:22 - literally every single one of our
58:24 - students say it's worth a 10k
58:25 - coding bootcamp like exactly because
58:27 - they just see so much value in that sort
58:29 - of community itself let alone the
58:31 - coaching calls and everything else
58:33 - so many different really really big in
58:35 - different types of levels
58:37 - that are together in one place are
58:39 - actually just going to boost up your
58:41 - performance your ability and really your
58:43 - whole motivation to code
58:45 - and you know exactly this takes me to my
58:47 - next point and this is a huge huge point
58:50 - if you want to do
58:51 - become a self-taught developer in 2020
58:54 - now that everything is getting
58:55 - modernized everybody's going into the
58:56 - internet
58:57 - you know something huge is actually
58:59 - creating online presence
59:02 - can you talk a little bit about that
59:03 - sonny because i know that you yeah
59:04 - you're so consistent on instagram
59:06 - and you know even on youtube man yeah
59:09 - like is in this is something which like
59:11 - i wish i did earlier guys like i really
59:13 - wish i did like
59:14 - and qazi is the ultimate example of this
59:16 - guys like
59:18 - like build like a following right like
59:20 - and literally it's not it's
59:21 - if you the way to think of it is like
59:23 - most people that i see who are starting
59:25 - off
59:25 - who don't do this like the difference
59:27 - between those guys and the guys i see
59:29 - posting like daily
59:31 - and frequently about like this is
59:32 - javascript it's not because the
59:33 - difference is
59:34 - like it's a way of keeping yourself
59:36 - accountable it's a way of constantly
59:38 - ensuring
59:39 - that you're moving forward so like by
59:41 - posting new content every day you need
59:43 - to be creative you need to think about
59:44 - like hang on what can i post today
59:46 - and like it's going to force you to
59:48 - learn about what's new in javascript
59:50 - what's new in web development
59:51 - what's new what can i learn today which
59:53 - is going to be cool for everyone else to
59:54 - see
59:55 - and like this goes on to the next slide
59:57 - which is basically a case of like
59:58 - guys record your journey but like on
60:01 - literally say you got instagram you got
60:03 - linkedin you got twitter you got
60:04 - facebook you got youtube
60:06 - like and don't be afraid like there's a
60:08 - really like good video by garyvee and
60:09 - it's like
60:10 - just stop giving a about like what
60:12 - everyone thinks like just go ahead and
60:13 - record it
60:14 - and as a developer guys like i can't
60:16 - stress enough like
60:18 - record everything including your
60:21 - failures
60:22 - and yes like when i say that like
60:23 - include your failures as well guys like
60:26 - because
60:26 - it's literally going to be a case of
60:28 - like that's a moment where
60:29 - like this is where like we sort of
60:31 - remove the stack over for
60:32 - overflow problem because when you
60:34 - literally
60:36 - are able to go ahead and say like yeah
60:37 - i'm failing on this today
60:39 - like you'll be surprised about how many
60:40 - other people are failing and i
60:42 - was sort of stuck on the same issue and
60:44 - then you start a community yourself like
60:45 - you start talking you meet people who
60:47 - are like-minded and doing the same thing
60:48 - as you
60:49 - um well what do you what do you think
60:51 - about that frankie especially with the
60:52 - failures part because a lot of people
60:54 - sort of like a bit like whoa what do you
60:55 - mean like record your failures
60:57 - yeah man i think that definitely it's
60:59 - super important to document your journey
61:01 - like garyvee says some people
61:03 - it's very hard for them to start you
61:04 - know recording their journey just
61:05 - because
61:06 - of the fact that they want to create
61:08 - something they want to create a scenario
61:10 - where it might look good on camera but
61:12 - the truth is that the most
61:14 - the best thing that you can actually see
61:15 - on camera is authenticity is
61:18 - genuine action is is really what's going
61:20 - on in your life and the way to do that
61:22 - is actually just documenting your
61:23 - journey man
61:24 - i know for a fact right now chris sean
61:26 - is one of the
61:27 - one of the youtube channels that i like
61:29 - he's a smaller youtube channel
61:30 - and this guy really does literally
61:31 - document his journey if he's getting
61:33 - fired off
61:34 - you know from his work if he's actually
61:36 - getting another job he's being super
61:38 - transparent with this
61:39 - we we might have him on the channel soon
61:41 - enough uh shout out to chris shawn yeah
61:43 - but man the failures are super important
61:45 - of
61:46 - a super important part of your journey
61:48 - it actually gives a little bit of flavor
61:50 - to your journey if you don't have any
61:51 - failures man it's like
61:52 - you can't you can't really boast about
61:54 - anything you can't really you know say
61:55 - that you struggled because
61:57 - everything seems like a like a landslide
62:00 - from there
62:00 - so you know that really does take us to
62:03 - our next point
62:04 - which is develop a programmer's mindset
62:07 - so can you speak a little bit about this
62:09 - sonny yeah so guys this is a big point
62:12 - because it's literally like
62:14 - when we kind of go into coding right we
62:16 - go in very like with a naked mindset of
62:18 - like we just don't know what to expect
62:19 - right
62:20 - like and we just kind of assume like
62:21 - it's this straight path like it's a
62:23 - straight path and like
62:24 - you have a beginner in the beginning and
62:25 - at the end of that road you have like
62:27 - some
62:28 - developer position or a job or something
62:29 - like that and even at the end of it like
62:31 - when we starting off i didn't know about
62:32 - teaching i didn't know about freelancing
62:34 - i didn't know about any i just knew that
62:35 - maybe i'll get a job at the end of this
62:37 - but the reality is it's not a linear
62:39 - sort of it's not like a line right it's
62:41 - a circular sort of
62:42 - mindset that you kind of need to adjust
62:44 - to and this goes into like
62:46 - getting your attitude right like how do
62:48 - you stay positive and how do you stay
62:50 - motivated
62:50 - and like i said motivation is something
62:52 - which you're going to start off with
62:54 - super high you're like wow there's so
62:55 - much money there's so much just now i
62:57 - want to do this forever blah blah blah
62:59 - but then you need to be able to be able
63:00 - to build that discipline right
63:02 - this goes on to like your behavior like
63:04 - what is what are you going to change
63:05 - with your behavior like are you going to
63:07 - start like
63:08 - and like incorporating like a pomodoro
63:10 - technique to make sure that you keep
63:11 - yourself accountable and you make sure
63:13 - that you're like
63:14 - sort of doing you're doing your work
63:15 - when you need to do it and that leads to
63:17 - like actions right
63:18 - actions like when you have a problem are
63:21 - you going to sit there and actually act
63:22 - on it or you're going to just sit there
63:24 - and stare at the thing and sort of make
63:25 - up excuses and things like that
63:27 - right when you do that enough times it's
63:29 - going to lead to actually leading to
63:30 - some kind of result
63:32 - right that result could be literally you
63:34 - getting paid by a client that result
63:35 - could literally be
63:37 - um you landing a job right
63:40 - and then what happens is that when you
63:42 - do those things it builds your
63:43 - confidence right it builds your
63:44 - confidence
63:45 - your performance overall as a thing goes
63:47 - up and then again that goes into your
63:48 - attitude it makes you feel good
63:50 - so you see like it's this circular
63:52 - movement right and frankie i feel like
63:53 - you have some really good insight here
63:54 - especially when it comes to like
63:56 - the sort of the attitude and the
63:57 - behavioral side of things like what
63:59 - what's your take on that like
64:00 - what do you feel about this sort of
64:01 - developer mindset man
64:03 - attitude is everything man every
64:05 - attitude is i cannot stress that enough
64:08 - just because when i've seen things go
64:10 - grey in my life
64:11 - whether code is not working whether my
64:14 - job is not working whether my living
64:15 - situation is not working as cause he
64:17 - said i was living in my car
64:18 - for two months actually that was pretty
64:20 - insane attitude is what actually you
64:22 - know
64:22 - dove me to take massive action to
64:26 - change my behavior and you know what
64:27 - attitude really is
64:29 - it it's what's that word that i'm
64:31 - looking for it's contagious you know
64:33 - you contage you you actually it
64:35 - transfers to other people the way that
64:36 - you feel about yourself the way that you
64:38 - feel about life
64:39 - and man this is massively important in a
64:42 - team
64:42 - you don't want to be an energy draft for
64:44 - your whole team especially if you're
64:46 - doing a project that is that's as hard
64:48 - as
64:49 - being a developer you know let's say
64:50 - you're building a rocket ship just like
64:52 - daniel is
64:52 - let's say you're working in tesla
64:54 - creating self-driving cars
64:56 - you don't want to have somebody that's
64:57 - going to be a sinkhole of energy
64:59 - and your team attitude is one of the
65:01 - most important things because
65:02 - as sonny was saying attitude does affect
65:04 - your behavior and then
65:05 - action is really the byproduct of
65:09 - behavior and then your action really
65:11 - brings results
65:13 - so then the results dictate your
65:15 - performance you know
65:16 - so you know seeing
65:19 - that you're getting good results it's
65:21 - gonna affect your performance it's gonna
65:22 - give you
65:23 - positive feedback or negative feedback
65:25 - and you have to reiterate from that and
65:27 - i feel like
65:28 - being very honest with the feedback that
65:29 - you get being able to be part of a
65:31 - community or a team of people that tell
65:33 - you hey
65:33 - man you actually you're you're you're
65:36 - doing bad right here like you have to
65:38 - change this you have to
65:40 - reassess this because you're actually
65:42 - affecting other people
65:43 - you have to be very honest about you
65:45 - know what is in front of you
65:46 - and actually being able to take action
65:48 - on that that in itself is a huge skill
65:50 - that'll take you to become one of the
65:53 - best people
65:54 - you know in your community you're gonna
65:55 - be super influential
65:58 - exactly and two things that frankie
66:00 - mentioned there which were gold right
66:02 - one is like it's like it's it's kind of
66:04 - like contagious right that attitude and
66:06 - that mindset is going to be massively
66:07 - contagious
66:08 - so imagine like you have a bowl of fruit
66:10 - right what happens if you have one bad
66:12 - fruit and then it's like a rotten fruit
66:14 - it spreads right it spreads and the
66:15 - whole bowl gets infected and all
66:17 - the whole thing is no longer edible
66:18 - right so like that's an easy way to
66:20 - think of it right so what we're trying
66:21 - to move to is like
66:22 - you need to surround yourself with like
66:25 - positively
66:26 - like charged minded and like-minded
66:28 - people and this leads on really nicely
66:30 - and the one place that you can go ahead
66:32 - and find people like that
66:33 - is like developer conferences right so
66:36 - developer conferences are going to be
66:37 - amazing places where you can go and find
66:39 - people that are like
66:40 - not only that they're going to be
66:41 - developers there there's many people
66:43 - that aren't developers that are like
66:44 - business people so you might get exposed
66:46 - to different areas
66:47 - uh uh and different sort of things which
66:49 - you wouldn't have
66:51 - otherwise sort of exposed yourself to
66:53 - but like guys this is really gonna sort
66:54 - of help you
66:55 - um take your sort of skill set like for
66:58 - example if you're lacking
67:00 - in soft skills i noticed when i started
67:02 - going to conferences
67:03 - i massively opened up and i became a lot
67:05 - more extroverted
67:06 - as opposed to sort of being that
67:07 - introverted developer what's your take
67:09 - on conferences um
67:10 - frankie man i love conferences of
67:14 - all sorts that's how frankie and i met
67:16 - yeah exactly that's oh no
67:18 - that's cozy man yeah this is literally
67:20 - how him and i met and that's how aaron
67:22 - and i met yeah conferences were kings
67:25 - one of the things that i didn't want to
67:26 - touch on is the fact that we said we
67:28 - mentioned you know have an online
67:29 - presence
67:30 - do record your journey one of the big
67:32 - things we do in the team
67:34 - you know every time that we go to
67:35 - conferences we actually interview
67:37 - tons of people because there's no other
67:41 - scenario where so many
67:42 - like-minded individuals come into a
67:44 - place and not only that they're
67:46 - like-minded but the levels of
67:48 - you know their performance is huge so
67:50 - all types of people of each level
67:52 - are in conferences and so one of the
67:53 - things that we did last conference we
67:55 - were at
67:56 - funnel hacking live in nashville
67:57 - tennessee and we ended up
67:59 - having about three different interviews
68:02 - with people that we admire and that's
68:03 - insane and we would never be able to
68:05 - have those type of interviews
68:07 - in any other part of the world really so
68:10 - you know
68:10 - you do want to record your journey go to
68:12 - conferences
68:13 - meet these people and it's such a good
68:15 - way to start a relationship
68:17 - if you interview somebody you have just
68:19 - that much more connection because you
68:20 - guys have produced you know content
68:22 - together
68:23 - you guys have actually you know shared a
68:25 - bunch of experiences in front of a
68:26 - camera which is a very intimate type of
68:28 - thing you know
68:28 - even that helps you build a relationship
68:30 - with that
68:32 - exactly and we had a lot of questions
68:34 - earlier as to like how can i find a
68:35 - mentor or how can i find people like
68:37 - when i'm
68:38 - starting out as a beginner guys this is
68:40 - like the place to go to like
68:41 - honestly a lot of conferences are free
68:43 - like i went to a facebook one recently
68:45 - in london
68:46 - and that one was completely free and i
68:48 - met a bunch of cool people there
68:50 - and actually made a friend there who
68:51 - ended up helping me solve a problem i
68:53 - was having at work
68:54 - like so like the the sort of networking
68:57 - and the power that you're going to get
68:58 - from that is is really unbeatable and
68:59 - like and that was completely free
69:01 - so like if it's a sort of concern as to
69:03 - money like guys a lot of this is free
69:05 - and
69:05 - also if you're in different parts of the
69:07 - world you can actually join conferences
69:09 - like digitally and you can actually sit
69:10 - inside of like calls and this and that
69:12 - um and then like you you'll meet people
69:14 - in the comments section like it's really
69:16 - definitely something i would recommend
69:17 - that
69:18 - everyone is for developers especially
69:21 - right now with the whole covet thing
69:22 - going on you know
69:23 - right now maybe there's not a lot of
69:26 - conferences going on but like you
69:27 - mentioned digital conferences are a huge
69:29 - thing
69:29 - and actually i know for a fact nas is
69:32 - one of the people that would get a lot
69:33 - of roi
69:34 - in conferences he started working with
69:36 - us about in november
69:37 - of 2019 and he was telling us that a lot
69:40 - of his clients freelancing clients
69:42 - came from actually being in conferences
69:44 - so you know sparking out conversations
69:46 - with
69:46 - other software engineers or business
69:48 - owners you can offer your service to
69:50 - them
69:50 - try to solve their problems and really
69:53 - all of those things
69:54 - are going to help you massively and that
69:55 - really just takes me to my next point
69:58 - our next point which is
70:01 - yeah so guys like pretty much it
70:03 - revolves around the developing
70:05 - programs mindset so we have we've made
70:07 - like a few different points which are
70:08 - going to help you
70:09 - start and get and get on that sort of um
70:11 - path to doing that so one of them is we
70:14 - mentioned is finishing your projects
70:16 - now what we mean here guys is literally
70:18 - it's can this goes hand in hand with
70:20 - number two so mastering one language so
70:22 - firstly
70:22 - i think it'll be a good thing to
70:23 - actually explain that one so guys when
70:25 - you're starting off your journey right
70:27 - there's a lot of people that are here
70:28 - like should i learn this or this should
70:30 - i learn java or python should in
70:31 - javascript or
70:33 - or like c plus plus now guys
70:36 - whatever you learn like all i will say
70:39 - is that like
70:39 - uh we we've all sort of everyone on the
70:41 - teams coded for a very long time and
70:43 - honest like joint advice is literally a
70:45 - case of like once you know one language
70:47 - it's very transferable right but the
70:49 - thing is you need to stick to the
70:51 - language that you're sort of learning
70:53 - especially if you're in a beginner level
70:54 - stick to language you're learning and
70:56 - actually build your skill set up to a
70:58 - point where it's a sellable skill
71:00 - right build your your skills up to its
71:02 - first points it's actually celebrated
71:03 - it's actually useful
71:04 - if you keep jumping language and like
71:06 - you're doing java one second python one
71:08 - second and then
71:09 - you keep jumping around you're never
71:10 - going to reach a point where you can
71:11 - actually sell your skill
71:13 - right and this leads on to the first
71:14 - point of like finishing your projects
71:16 - so um frankly what do we mean here when
71:18 - we say finish your projects
71:20 - so a lot of people do have the habit of
71:22 - starting a project
71:23 - and just finishing about 80 of it i
71:26 - myself have seen
71:27 - myself in that situation a lot of times
71:28 - whether i'm like building an
71:30 - app or anything related to that i would
71:32 - see that i would have the ui design
71:34 - i would do the front end and i wouldn't
71:36 - finish the back end
71:37 - and i was like oh man it looks pretty
71:39 - but it didn't have any functionality to
71:40 - it other than just
71:41 - linking me to another page you know and
71:44 - the thing is that
71:45 - if you do develop that habit it's really
71:47 - hard for you to get out of it
71:49 - and the thing also is that you know
71:51 - you're creating a project you cannot
71:52 - even put it on your portfolio because
71:54 - it's not an
71:55 - it's not a complete project it's not
71:56 - it's not something that can be sellable
71:58 - like sunny was saying
72:00 - and you actually mentioned something
72:01 - really funny sunny um right now that we
72:03 - were talking
72:04 - about specifically mastering one
72:06 - specific language you know some people
72:07 - do dive into a bunch of different
72:09 - languages and they're like oh yeah
72:10 - i know python i know javascript i know
72:12 - java and i know all of this
72:14 - and then somebody in the interview is
72:15 - like okay book can you build something
72:17 - in one specific language and then
72:20 - they're like
72:21 - no but i know all of these languages
72:24 - it's like what is the point of that you
72:25 - know
72:25 - you cannot build anything so you're just
72:28 - kind of
72:29 - knowing knowledge to know it you know
72:35 - yeah that's that's right exactly like
72:38 - yeah literally guys and the one thing
72:40 - i'll answer here is that like
72:41 - if you are in doubt as to what language
72:43 - to sort of start or like what language
72:45 - do you sort of pick first
72:47 - what i will say is like a lot of people
72:48 - kind of go towards i don't know why this
72:50 - happens but like
72:51 - they go towards like the languages like
72:53 - java c plus plus like the sort of like
72:55 - oh because
72:56 - they're the more tougher or clever
72:57 - languages that people say right yeah now
72:59 - what i would say is
73:01 - throw that mindset out the window and
73:03 - focus on value driven growth and what i
73:05 - mean by that is
73:06 - what is going to be the language is
73:08 - going to give you
73:09 - the sort of most value and think of it
73:12 - in a sellable way right
73:13 - like if you have a client who comes up
73:15 - to you and says i want a website built
73:16 - it needs a front end on the back end
73:18 - literally javascript is going is an
73:20 - amazing language for you because why
73:22 - it's it's going to be very easy to like
73:25 - get things up and running as a front end
73:27 - you can also use javascript as a back
73:28 - end with node.js focus on that if you if
73:31 - you went ahead
73:32 - and started learning c plus plus cool
73:34 - you could probably build like an
73:35 - embedded little
73:36 - uh circuit board right now how's that
73:38 - going to help you build like a website
73:40 - right like you see what i mean like
73:42 - think about it in that sense and
73:43 - suddenly the questions start making
73:45 - sense yeah man a lot of people think
73:47 - that
73:47 - you do have to end up you know learning
73:49 - a super complicated language or complex
73:51 - language like c
73:52 - plus plus or maybe even assembly so that
73:54 - you can know how you know data is being
73:56 - stored or how
73:58 - how to actually do a bunch of complex
74:00 - things that how a computer thinks how
74:02 - you know circuit boards work things
74:04 - related to that and that somehow is
74:06 - going to help you know
74:07 - programming so deeply that you're going
74:09 - to understand other languages
74:11 - well enough well the thing is that it
74:13 - really is
74:14 - what are you looking to do you know if
74:15 - you're trying to build a web page if
74:17 - you're trying to
74:18 - go into maybe ai maybe
74:21 - something related to python i don't know
74:23 - you know it does require different types
74:25 - of skill set
74:26 - sometimes it doesn't require you to dive
74:28 - that deep as to
74:29 - learning all the nitty-gritty like sunny
74:31 - says
74:34 - very british logan mentioned a really
74:36 - good question here guys it says
74:38 - understanding that i challenge you on at
74:41 - least from a job searching standpoint a
74:42 - lot of job descriptions are listing off
74:44 - for three to four languages for entry
74:46 - level positions
74:46 - how do i find a medium that's actually a
74:49 - really really good question
74:50 - um it's a really really good question
74:52 - and it's true like a lot of job listings
74:54 - ask for like a bunch of different
74:56 - languages so how do you find the middle
74:58 - ground
74:58 - and what my answer is to that is like
75:00 - think about it from this perspective
75:01 - right like if you have a web development
75:04 - job and let's say the job is a react
75:05 - front-end developer or something like
75:06 - that
75:07 - in that job i do agree with you it's
75:08 - going to say like javascript is going to
75:10 - say maybe
75:10 - java for a back-end role or something
75:12 - like that or node.js or something like
75:14 - that
75:14 - like but then what what tends to happen
75:17 - actually in those job listings if you
75:19 - look at it
75:19 - deeper they're actually usually broken
75:21 - down into skills which have revolved
75:23 - around
75:24 - javascript so like um ability to use
75:26 - rest apis ability to use redux ability
75:29 - to use things like that
75:30 - and the ones that do list every language
75:33 - under the sun
75:34 - i can tell you now like if you actually
75:35 - go for the interview and like sort of
75:37 - speak to them
75:38 - it's sometimes it's literally because
75:39 - they've literally copied and pasted sort
75:41 - of another job listing and they've just
75:42 - modified it
75:43 - and sort of made it sound like it's a
75:44 - very sort of common thing as to like
75:46 - even when react first came out
75:48 - there was job listings saying five years
75:50 - experience in react
75:51 - which is something so funny because like
75:53 - react hasn't
75:54 - hadn't even been out for like a year at
75:56 - the time but like people wanted like
75:58 - like five years so like the point is is
76:00 - that like to get a middle ground there
76:01 - guys
76:02 - focus on one language and naturally
76:04 - you'll start to sort of build the
76:06 - stack or sort of your knowledge around
76:08 - the stack that the job positions are
76:09 - going to be asking for
76:10 - and then once you get a conversation
76:12 - going it kind of moves to a point as
76:13 - just show them that you're eager to
76:14 - learn and then the rest becomes like
76:16 - quite a sort of
76:17 - simple conversation to have yeah
76:19 - definitely and another
76:20 - great way to actually bring down that
76:24 - knowledge to something practical is
76:27 - building projects
76:29 - yeah exactly so yeah so yeah building
76:33 - projects
76:33 - there's an example of the netflix
76:34 - project that qazi and sunny built a few
76:37 - days ago this this actual video is going
76:39 - viral it's insane we were surprised man
76:41 - i didn't know so many people wanted to
76:42 - build netflix so can you tell us a
76:44 - little bit more about this project yeah
76:47 - yeah exactly and guys if you enjoyed
76:49 - like if you were actually here and built
76:51 - this project let us know right now and
76:53 - like literally a case of
76:54 - we just went ahead and like what i will
76:57 - say is that like if you're
76:58 - if you're in your early journey right
77:00 - and you're sort of beginning a beginner
77:02 - uh what i would definitely recommend is
77:03 - go ahead and check out the live sessions
77:05 - that we did
77:06 - because it really really was like
77:09 - there's so many like value bombs in
77:11 - those videos where we just go ahead and
77:12 - build projects
77:14 - and what we sort of taking away and
77:15 - leading here up to is basically
77:17 - like guys when you're new build projects
77:19 - and like we said before
77:20 - make sure you finish them right make
77:22 - sure you finish them
77:23 - so build the projects finish them and
77:25 - then guys what this is going to show
77:27 - is you do not want to be that developer
77:30 - who goes to a job
77:31 - prints out a nice a4 piece of paper with
77:33 - a list of skills on it
77:35 - and says this is what i can do because
77:37 - i'm telling you now like they're going
77:38 - to look at you and be like
77:39 - um okay but like where's the proof like
77:41 - can you actually are they going to ask
77:43 - you a bunch of questions
77:44 - and they will catch you out if you're if
77:45 - you're lying to them so instead
77:47 - if you have a website or project like
77:50 - the netflix clone for example
77:52 - that shows that you can use um flexbox
77:55 - that shows that you can use react that
77:57 - shows that you know how to use
77:58 - responsive designs and css animations
78:01 - all without saying a single word right
78:04 - so like have enough of those on your
78:05 - projects and you you don't even have to
78:07 - explain at that point
78:09 - they kind of throw the sort of list of
78:10 - requirements out the window they're like
78:12 - whoa these projects are really nice
78:14 - and that kind of does the speaking for
78:15 - you and it gets you the interviews so
78:17 - having a banger portfolio is actually
78:19 - going to really really be something
78:21 - you're going to need to invest in
78:22 - and invest time and i see a lot of
78:24 - people say like i don't have time or i
78:25 - don't want to investigate i don't want
78:26 - to spend that long on my portfolio
78:28 - well in that case you probably are going
78:30 - to be stuck in a loop of like submitting
78:32 - hundreds of applications
78:33 - because you're going to keep running
78:34 - into a problem of trying to prove your
78:37 - skill
78:38 - especially when you haven't landed your
78:39 - first job so literally i landed my first
78:42 - job just from having like
78:43 - a a project and a skill like as in a
78:46 - project and a bunch of things on my
78:47 - portfolio
78:48 - that i was able to demo and that changed
78:50 - it for me yeah guys definitely don't lie
78:52 - on your resumes because
78:54 - a lot of times they're going to expose
78:55 - you you do not
78:57 - want to be in that situation
79:00 - so another example of a good project to
79:02 - build would be the
79:03 - amazon project that you know sonny and
79:06 - kazzy built as well the other day
79:08 - so you know these guys are going yeah m
79:10 - for you guys you know
79:11 - these guys are really teaching you
79:12 - skills that are very marketable
79:14 - and projects that a lot of people want
79:16 - to build right now amazon netflix
79:18 - all of these you know even twitter even
79:22 - all of these huge tech companies right
79:23 - now are super poppin and
79:25 - everybody wants to learn how to build
79:27 - very similar projects
79:28 - so you know do stick around for more of
79:30 - the live streams that we're gonna be
79:31 - having the next days
79:32 - so can you tell us a little bit about
79:34 - this amazon project sunny
79:37 - yeah this was dope dude like this was
79:39 - such a fun one and this is blowing up as
79:40 - well like we're really
79:41 - we really love how how much you guys are
79:43 - loving it right now but this showed like
79:45 - authentication
79:46 - the react context api which is
79:48 - essentially a
79:50 - simpler form of redux which is like uh
79:52 - built in-house with react
79:54 - um but pretty much like with this amazon
79:56 - clone you could go ahead and you got a
79:58 - really beautiful visual interface which
80:00 - was responsive
80:01 - and then you can add things to your
80:02 - basket log in and then actually go to
80:05 - your basket and see a checkout page
80:06 - which updates in
80:07 - it dynamically right so this was um this
80:10 - was a really fun project logan says is
80:12 - that an emergency emoji inside the p tag
80:14 - you can do that
80:15 - yes you can actually put emojis inside
80:17 - your code and it does work
80:18 - um which is really cool to see but yeah
80:20 - guys if you do want to go check it out
80:22 - really good project bunch of uh like
80:25 - knowledge
80:26 - like sort of bombs in that video um it's
80:29 - it was definitely a really fun
80:30 - i couldn't believe how many people stuck
80:32 - it out and built the whole thing like
80:34 - like it was amazing to see that like and
80:35 - guys one thing i would say is that if
80:37 - you do enjoy
80:37 - those like literally the only reason
80:40 - that me kazi the rest of the guys were
80:41 - able to see
80:42 - those that you enjoyed it was because
80:44 - you guys tag us in stories you guys
80:46 - shout us out in your sort of like
80:48 - instagram stories and things like that
80:49 - so like if you do enjoy it
80:50 - make sure you keep doing that because we
80:52 - love those conversations with you guys
80:54 - yeah man and the reason why you want to
80:56 - build these type of projects is really
80:58 - because you want to put them
81:00 - put them on your portfolio right so you
81:02 - want to build a strong portfolio that
81:04 - you can share
81:05 - with you know recruiters with the actual
81:08 - employees that are going to hire you
81:10 - it really just serves even yourself to
81:12 - know what type of projects you've
81:14 - dealt in you know so building a strong
81:17 - portfolio is definitely
81:18 - an essential if you want to become a
81:20 - developer especially a self-taught
81:22 - developer
81:23 - and also having an actual website as a
81:26 - portfolio is huge nowadays it really
81:28 - helps you
81:29 - distinguish yourself from all the other
81:31 - individuals that
81:32 - just turn in a piece of paper that's you
81:34 - know that can get wrinkled that can get
81:37 - even stained
81:38 - make sure you have a website for your
81:39 - own portfolio
81:42 - exactly and guys if you do have a
81:43 - website top tip
81:45 - make sure you do what this guy did right
81:46 - here and it says matt farley.ca so
81:48 - he went ahead and bought a domain i see
81:50 - so many developers who have
81:52 - such beautiful websites but then they
81:53 - just deploy it on like the
81:55 - the default domain that they get given
81:56 - in like some services and it just it's
81:58 - like when you have such a nice portfolio
82:01 - but you don't link it to your own domain
82:02 - like it's one extra step but it does
82:04 - sort of tie it together so make sure you
82:06 - get a custom domain if you do go ahead
82:07 - and you should
82:08 - definitely build a portfolio of yourself
82:10 - talk um because that's going to be your
82:12 - sort of
82:12 - that's going to be your replacement for
82:14 - a degree guys that's going to be like
82:16 - your showcase that's going to be
82:17 - everything which is going to demonstrate
82:19 - why a company or a client is going to
82:21 - take you on and trust you with the work
82:23 - and trust
82:24 - you with that sort of responsibility so
82:26 - this is going to be everything for you
82:27 - guys
82:28 - yeah man i think it kind of looks a
82:29 - little bit ugly when you have a
82:31 - portfolio that says something like
82:33 - you know blogspot.com or like blog.com
82:36 - something that just doesn't you know
82:38 - have your own
82:39 - name into it just having your name yes
82:42 - in that url makes
82:43 - makes yourself a brand makes yourself
82:45 - way more marketable
82:46 - so that's a huge and important point
82:49 - another thing that we want to hit a big
82:51 - point
82:52 - another top skill and this is our last
82:54 - skill to hit
82:55 - you know to become a self-taught
82:56 - developer it's huge huge huge
82:59 - huge if you do want to end up landing a
83:00 - job if you do want to end up being part
83:02 - of a team
83:03 - if you do want to contribute to open
83:05 - source projects
83:06 - and that is going to be get
83:10 - guys get get get is something that you
83:13 - all need to know
83:14 - all right now like like frankie said and
83:17 - he i think he just summed up really well
83:18 - though like is literally a case of if
83:19 - you want to land a job
83:20 - if you want to work in a team if you
83:22 - want to contribute to open source
83:24 - projects
83:24 - you're going to need to know get now
83:26 - what is git it's something
83:28 - it's basically a version control system
83:30 - which is basically
83:32 - a way that like if you're working in a
83:34 - team or if you're working for a company
83:36 - they store all of their code in like
83:39 - something called a git repository so
83:40 - most companies will be using get
83:42 - if they aren't then probably don't want
83:44 - to work there to be honest like because
83:45 - it should be something which is a
83:46 - standard um and pretty much the things
83:49 - that you're going to need to know how to
83:50 - do are like
83:51 - how to create commits how to create a
83:53 - repo how do you actually clone a repo
83:55 - how do you branch and merge and things
83:56 - like that
83:57 - those are things which you're going to
83:59 - there's their skills which are yes
84:00 - they're very scary when you first get
84:01 - involved in it
84:03 - and i was very scared of learning and
84:05 - honestly guys in git it's very
84:06 - easy to think that you're going to break
84:08 - everything but i promise you like you
84:09 - can undo things in gear and
84:11 - something that i'd recommend is that if
84:13 - you're new and and you don't understand
84:15 - sort of or you're very new to sort of
84:17 - using git or version control systems
84:18 - maybe use like a graphical user
84:20 - interface such as get kraken
84:23 - so get kraken is a really good um sort
84:25 - of a
84:26 - git client it is paid for but there are
84:29 - free ones out there
84:30 - i'd really recommend if you're new why
84:32 - don't you just use a graphical user
84:33 - interface until you get comfortable with
84:35 - the command line
84:36 - um but definitely something that is
84:38 - worth worth investing your time into
84:40 - learning
84:40 - and this is going to allow you to do
84:42 - what um what frankie
84:44 - really is going to allow you to
84:45 - contribute to open source projects man
84:47 - and it's huge if you do end up you know
84:50 - contributing to open source projects
84:52 - because it's going to give you that much
84:53 - more leverage
84:54 - in an interview in finding a job just
84:57 - because of the fact that you know you're
84:59 - you're actually helping a community of
85:00 - coders make their software a little bit
85:03 - better
85:04 - you know and if you don't have git then
85:06 - it's going to be very hard for you to
85:08 - contribute to this
85:10 - exactly and actually i actually
85:12 - contributed to a a big open source
85:14 - project before
85:15 - is one quarter so we've used it we use
85:18 - it over at clever programmer but a lot
85:19 - of you guys might have heard of
85:20 - something called stripe
85:22 - which is a payment processor and i
85:24 - actually contributed code to stripe
85:26 - and when i did that it blew my mind
85:28 - because i was like i remember i was
85:30 - working on it and i was like
85:31 - yo like it doesn't they don't support
85:34 - what i'm trying to do right now
85:35 - and i was like but it really should and
85:37 - i was so confident i was like
85:39 - i was like no that i'm sure they need to
85:40 - have this i was using something called
85:42 - typescript which
85:43 - sits above javascript um and it didn't
85:46 - have the correct type definitions and
85:47 - things like that so i went ahead and
85:48 - added them
85:49 - and then i remember i submitted it and
85:51 - it blew my mind when it went inside so
85:53 - even to this
85:54 - day i get emails saying you're a
85:55 - moderator of the stripe repo and i was
85:57 - like holy crap
85:58 - like it really does feel nice to be part
86:00 - of a community and like
86:02 - loads of people use that stuff so like
86:04 - if you want to be involved in that sort
86:05 - of scale
86:06 - definitely learn gear and start
86:08 - contributing with open source projects
86:09 - really good way to find a mentor as well
86:11 - wow that's amazing man stripe is such a
86:14 - huge company it's a great company it's
86:15 - so
86:16 - it's it's interesting because it just
86:18 - grew so fast now it's a billion dollar
86:20 - company
86:20 - and i heard a statistic that even more
86:23 - than the more than 50 percent of all
86:25 - internet transactions in the us
86:27 - use stripe like wow what happened to
86:30 - paypal
86:31 - you know that's that's insane yeah
86:32 - that's crazy and so all of these
86:34 - all of these projects right here are
86:36 - open source projects that
86:38 - facebook does have right now publicly so
86:41 - react is one of them and we use it a lot
86:44 - and you know that's where we actually
86:46 - built the
86:47 - amazon clone and how we actually built
86:49 - the netflix clone
86:50 - that is kazian and sunny
86:54 - yeah yeah guys like and this is another
86:56 - thing like
86:58 - big companies like it's not just small
87:00 - projects whenever you sort of have open
87:01 - source projects you kind of think
87:02 - they're going to be small things
87:04 - right react react native like both are
87:06 - like open source you can contribute to
87:08 - them
87:08 - you can actually go ahead and like
87:10 - investigate on like a bugs or issues
87:13 - and like uh if you ever get stuck like
87:14 - believe me like people do actually reply
87:16 - and
87:17 - i can see graphql there graphql is
87:19 - another huge um
87:20 - sort of uh it's a massive weights or
87:22 - interact with your apis and stuff like
87:23 - that that's a huge skill that's worth
87:25 - learning for you guys who are
87:26 - self-taught right now and coming up in
87:28 - your journey
87:29 - um so definitely something to check and
87:31 - why are
87:32 - why is all of this so so valuable like
87:34 - at the end of this
87:35 - we mentioned five skills guys we
87:37 - mentioned like all of these different
87:38 - skills that you need to
87:39 - unlike know and sort of take into
87:41 - account when you're becoming a
87:42 - self-taught developer
87:43 - and the obvious end goal is to land a
87:46 - position
87:46 - or a job right so frank let's go ahead
87:48 - and show them
87:50 - what is out there and what the sort of
87:51 - potential looks like
87:53 - at the end of the road so for a
87:54 - front-end developer at least here in los
87:56 - angeles in california usa
87:59 - the average salary for a front end
88:00 - developer would be around 99
88:03 - 000 that is almost the six figure mark
88:06 - that is insane my man that's insane i
88:09 - mean with cash bonus that is a six
88:10 - figure mark like look at the cash
88:13 - you get bonus 3k bonus yeah and guys
88:15 - we're talking like
88:16 - massive benefits and for those of you
88:18 - who are outside of the us
88:19 - like i'm based in london like guys there
88:21 - is really no barrier when it comes to
88:23 - software development like you could be
88:24 - based anywhere in the world
88:26 - and work for like a u.s client you could
88:28 - be a base anywhere in the world for a
88:29 - london client like
88:30 - as long as you have internet connection
88:32 - and you have the skill set you are able
88:34 - to sell that skill
88:35 - right so it's something to bear in mind
88:37 - when you when you're looking at this
88:38 - like
88:38 - don't think that just because you're in
88:40 - a different country that like it doesn't
88:42 - apply to you
88:43 - it really does like it really really
88:44 - does and it and your skill
88:47 - your skill level is going to determine
88:49 - that so never write it off just put just
88:51 - think about you remember like we said
88:53 - get your why and understand what your
88:55 - end goal is and uh
88:56 - and focus on that and also what leads on
88:58 - to this guys is something like
89:00 - javascript so we said mastering one
89:01 - language right
89:02 - javascript is something which you can
89:04 - use on the front end
89:05 - and the back end and like let's go ahead
89:07 - and show you what back end developer
89:09 - salary looks
89:10 - like so look at that that's insane
89:13 - there we go back in developer salary yes
89:17 - as you were saying 121
89:19 - 000 a year this is obviously based here
89:23 - in california in la
89:24 - this is a huge huge huge type of salary
89:27 - and really it is a privilege you know to
89:30 - be earning that much money doing
89:31 - something as fun as coding
89:33 - and you know touching up on all the
89:35 - points that we did hit
89:36 - social skills soft skills all of these
89:38 - things are actually going to help you
89:40 - you know increase your income whether
89:42 - you're a front-end developer or a
89:43 - back-end developer
89:44 - you can now be and have the skills to
89:47 - negotiate your salary you can
89:49 - you know say the terms that you want to
89:51 - work in maybe
89:53 - you can say oh i want to work remotely
89:55 - and be earning a little bit less or i
89:57 - want to
89:58 - you know work in-house earn a little bit
90:00 - more or i just want to do these specific
90:02 - tasks i think i can be
90:04 - this valuable to this specific team you
90:06 - can now word out
90:07 - specifically what you want to do in that
90:09 - job and so that also dictates how much
90:11 - money you're going to earn in that
90:12 - current job
90:14 - so it's insane it just opens up
90:16 - opportunities for yourself
90:18 - yeah and we just showed you guys what a
90:20 - front-end developer salary is and what a
90:21 - back-end developer salary is but
90:22 - remember
90:23 - because it's like cross like javascript
90:25 - goes across front and back and you can
90:26 - become something called a
90:28 - full stack developer and in most of the
90:30 - positions where i've been
90:31 - a full it's been a full stack position
90:33 - so basically
90:35 - you can actually go ahead and actually
90:36 - be a full stack developer and you can
90:38 - even learn even more than this like
90:40 - so it's insane what you can actually go
90:42 - and do and like you can go from building
90:44 - an apps front end so the way it looks
90:46 - and feels to even it like building out
90:48 - the back end and literally being
90:50 - building everything from start to finish
90:52 - with
90:53 - with something like javascript so it's
90:55 - definitely something which you should
90:56 - bear in mind
90:57 - the potential is there is worth
90:59 - investing your time in and it is going
91:00 - to be something which will guarantee
91:02 - change your life if you put in the work
91:05 - that's right so
91:06 - depending where you are in the world the
91:08 - actual pay is obviously going to change
91:10 - depending like sonny said if you're in
91:12 - the uk if you're in mexico
91:14 - you're in other parts of europe if
91:16 - you're in africa you're gonna have
91:17 - different
91:18 - types of pace but the cool thing about
91:21 - the internet
91:21 - is the fact that you can actually get
91:23 - clients anywhere in the world now and so
91:25 - right now with this whole you know
91:26 - pandemic situation going on in the world
91:28 - a lot of people are getting clients from
91:30 - other types of countries
91:31 - and really it's a privilege to be able
91:33 - to live in a country where you know
91:35 - living situations are not that expensive
91:37 - as they are here in california
91:38 - you know sometimes that's why salaries
91:40 - are so high in places like silicon
91:42 - valley
91:43 - you know san francisco all of these
91:44 - places just because of the fact that
91:46 - it's so expensive to live there
91:47 - you know so if you can be earning 100k
91:50 - let's say in virginia which is a little
91:51 - bit
91:52 - less expensive than in california that
91:54 - you know that difference of
91:56 - living of the living expenses definitely
91:58 - goes a long way
92:00 - and specifically you know maybe you're
92:01 - living in philippines and you want to
92:03 - get some clients in the u.s or you want
92:04 - to get some clients in europe
92:05 - even in mexico who knows you know it's
92:08 - not that expensive
92:09 - relative to the us to live in some place
92:11 - like indonesia or maybe
92:13 - philippines and getting clients from
92:15 - other types of countries is really going
92:16 - to open up
92:17 - so many doors for you open up even more
92:20 - business and actual more experience man
92:22 - you're going to connect it's going to
92:24 - connect you to the whole world
92:25 - so that's one of the privileges of
92:26 - having the internet
92:29 - exactly and guys this is like the market
92:31 - this is the job that like literally
92:33 - leverages it to the max
92:35 - and it takes it to a whole new level of
92:37 - like taking advantage of the internet so
92:39 - definitely something to to bear in mind
92:41 - and um

92:44 - like where do you get started on your
92:45 - journey or like where do you
92:47 - where can you go from here like in terms

95:04 - want those type of you know toxic people
95:06 - around you especially
95:07 - trying to learn something as difficult

95:10 - because it might not be difficult but it
95:13 - does require a lot of focus you know you
95:14 - do have to put your heart into it
95:16 - it's not something that you're gonna

97:16 - great
97:17 - driver for a lot of people i know it is
97:19 - for me and it
97:21 - to me personally it's one of the huge
97:23 - the one of the biggest
97:24 - drives that i can actually put myself in
97:27 - so
97:28 - now you know we we thank you guys for
97:30 - being here now we're gonna take a few
97:32 - questions please drop intelligent
97:33 - questions down below
97:35 - so that me and sunny can actually answer
97:36 - a few of them
97:39 - yeah perfect and guys like like we said
97:41 - like i can see a lot of comments coming
97:42 - in where
97:43 - everyone's saying like uh makko watson
97:45 - says kazzy sonny frankie good stuff keep
97:47 - it going please
97:48 - guys we love you guys we appreciate the
97:50 - support and like if you guys found this
97:52 - valuable the lead like all we ask is
97:54 - literally just smash the thumbs up
97:55 - button because
97:56 - it will help somebody else find it just
97:57 - as valuable and it will help change
97:59 - someone else's life um and to be
98:02 - like for the better we have one question
98:04 - which we can ask in the meantime while
98:06 - we wait for some more
98:07 - it's by darren watts so it's just a
98:09 - little bit up um and it says
98:11 - just a req just a question regarding
98:14 - um the netflix clone that you guys built
98:16 - and posting it inside the portfolio
98:18 - we're not originating that code we're
98:20 - recreating what you guys create how's
98:21 - that viewed by employers
98:22 - so really good question and my take on
98:25 - this is essentially like
98:27 - like although although yes technically
98:30 - we are
98:30 - sort of like you're recreating code that
98:32 - we've done guys it's going to actually
98:34 - be a case of like
98:35 - it's not just as easy as recreating
98:37 - right like a lot of people do like the
98:39 - reason why people message is because
98:40 - they get stuck
98:41 - because copying like a big code base
98:43 - like that isn't as simple
98:45 - as just like literally copying line for
98:47 - line because there are things which go
98:48 - wrong which takes it takes a level of
98:50 - understanding
98:51 - to actually go ahead and get that moving
98:54 - right like it takes level of
98:55 - understanding to get that working
98:56 - and get over that and uh frankie what's
98:58 - your what's your viewpoint on this in
99:00 - terms of um
99:01 - like sort of building projects for
99:02 - example like youtube tutorials
99:04 - and things like that definitely man i
99:06 - think that if you are building something
99:08 - that somebody's teaching you how to
99:09 - build
99:10 - obviously play a little with it you know
99:12 - have your twist to it so
99:14 - you know maybe maybe the interface is
99:16 - black
99:17 - play around with the colors change out
99:19 - the ui be like oh
99:20 - this looks a little bit more efficient
99:22 - i'm going to try this so now that you
99:23 - kind of have the building blocks of the
99:25 - whole project
99:26 - then you can just spice it up with your
99:27 - style you know and that's what's going
99:28 - to make you a great programmer at the
99:30 - end of the day
99:31 - you know playing with what you're given
99:33 - playing with the tools that you're given
99:34 - you know a lot of times you are working
99:36 - with a team so you're playing with
99:38 - other people's code this is a prime
99:40 - example of that now you have a project
99:41 - in your hands
99:42 - and then you can build it to however you
99:44 - want to see it you know
99:46 - and we right now you know have have
99:50 - offered a lot of great
99:51 - projects for you to build netflix you
99:53 - know covet tracker
99:55 - amazon all of these you can just change
99:57 - them up and put them on your portfolio
99:59 - make them even better
100:00 - share them with us you know share them
100:02 - with people help
100:03 - help people with that actual code you
100:05 - know now i do have another question here
100:07 - that i think it's kind of interesting
100:09 - just because
100:10 - this guy says he's been a node
100:13 - sorry a php developer for the last six
100:16 - years
100:17 - sunny what is your take on this node.js
100:19 - versus python versus php
100:22 - so this is a really cool question
100:23 - because i actually coded php for quite a
100:26 - while
100:26 - back in the day like many of you guys
100:28 - might not know that but yeah like i did
100:29 - php for a while
100:31 - um php did power the internet for a very
100:33 - long time facebook was built on php for
100:35 - for
100:36 - when when mark zuckerberg got it up and
100:37 - running um
100:39 - so my take on this guys is node.js came
100:42 - along and it wasn't
100:43 - super powerful when it first arrived but
100:45 - now it's it's it's it is insanely
100:47 - powerful like you can build entire back
100:49 - ends with node.js
100:50 - um python is something which is
100:52 - definitely a valuable skill guys it's
100:54 - really good for automation it's really
100:56 - good for
100:56 - building powerful powerful um sort of
100:59 - back ends and you can also go ahead and
101:00 - build like front ends
101:01 - with the sort of web development stack
101:03 - but i would recommend honestly
101:05 - at this point um i would recommend
101:08 - putting your time into javascript in my
101:10 - opinion
101:11 - reason being php is sort of getting sort
101:13 - of not i wouldn't say
101:14 - like deprecate but in the future years
101:16 - to come the market share
101:18 - like the number one most wanted library
101:20 - right now is react and that is
101:21 - javascript like it is such high demand
101:24 - and you'll see php on that list is
101:26 - definitely flying lower
101:27 - so my point is is that you want to
101:29 - invest your time in things which are
101:31 - future proofed
101:32 - where you're gonna have some reassurance
101:34 - that you know that the skills you're
101:35 - learning now
101:36 - are still gonna be sort of valuable in
101:37 - five ten years so my
101:39 - advice to that is node.js and then the
101:41 - runner-up being python yeah
101:43 - awesome yeah i myself learned some some
101:46 - php as well
101:47 - some people that say that it's super
101:48 - hard to learn it it's actually not that
101:50 - hard like
101:51 - and so i did that while learning a
101:53 - little bit of javascript
101:55 - to actually host servers and so
101:58 - you know i think it's a cool language
102:00 - yes it's getting a little bit outdated
102:01 - so
102:01 - do you know focus your time on something
102:03 - that's a little bit more relevant like
102:04 - javascript
102:05 - and that's going to be future-proof as
102:07 - sunny is saying i see a comment here by
102:09 - elijah fueller he says frankie could you
102:12 - promise us another video i mean my
102:14 - friend i really
102:15 - am enjoying this hopefully you know i
102:17 - can bring you guys a little bit more
102:18 - content
102:19 - thank you you know for for having me for
102:21 - sticking out this long and actually
102:23 - picking up a few
102:24 - things that me and sunny just discussed
102:26 - we're definitely going to have
102:28 - be bringing a lot of value to you guys
102:30 - in the future videos as well we're going
102:31 - to be live streaming this whole month
102:33 - and as of now we don't have any end date
102:35 - to this so it's just going to keep on
102:37 - coming
102:37 - yeah exactly we have a really good
102:40 - question i've seen a few people asking
102:41 - now react js or angular
102:44 - um really really nice guys um so
102:47 - react.js or angular
102:48 - my opinion react.js we teach it on the
102:51 - channel like that we have a bunch of uh
102:53 - sort of really valuable sort of
102:55 - resources that you guys can go ahead and
102:56 - check out right now for free
102:58 - um but my my take on this guys is
103:00 - because
103:01 - react is a library uh as compared to
103:04 - angular which is a framework now the
103:05 - difference with those two things
103:07 - is that it react is much more
103:09 - lightweight
103:10 - right it's much more lightweight which
103:11 - means the entry into it
103:13 - is going to be a lot easier when you're
103:14 - especially if you're a beginner or
103:16 - you're learning
103:17 - um and also guys huge companies are
103:20 - built with react like instagram
103:21 - tinder uber um you have like facebook
103:25 - facebook at the facebook react right i
103:27 - guess yeah tesla
103:28 - exactly you have all of these companies
103:30 - which are built with react whereas
103:32 - in angular it was something which which
103:34 - there was a
103:35 - there was a very high point where
103:37 - angular was in it was in high demand in
103:38 - use but now
103:39 - if you look at the sort of latest trends
103:42 - the trends flipped and reacted
103:43 - skyrocketing and angular and view are
103:45 - sort of starting to come down
103:47 - so like i would definitely recommend
103:49 - like we said before
103:50 - invest your time in something which is
103:52 - future proofed in this case
103:54 - react and i see assad oola says what
103:56 - about react native so that leads on to
103:58 - it
103:58 - if you learn react you're not only
104:00 - learning web development you're also
104:02 - learning
104:02 - ios and android development because if
104:05 - you know react
104:06 - you can code in react native put it that
104:08 - way like i i learned react and then i
104:10 - actually built a comp an app for a
104:12 - company in um
104:13 - in my first job and i didn't know react
104:14 - native i never could do it before
104:16 - um so yeah that would be my take on that
104:19 - one yeah
104:20 - man i think it's an interesting battle
104:21 - between react.js and angular i mean i
104:24 - feel like they're all symbiotic really
104:26 - it's depending on what you want to do
104:27 - it's interesting because react.js was
104:29 - made by facebook and angular is made by
104:31 - google
104:32 - so two of the biggest companies you know
104:35 - offered these
104:36 - languages or these frameworks for people
104:38 - to use just because they found
104:40 - more efficient ways to write their code
104:42 - and it's awesome man i know that react
104:44 - native is also a really good
104:46 - you know language to use as well if you
104:49 - do know react like sun is saying
104:50 - you can translate that to react native
104:52 - but react native in my opinion was
104:54 - really
104:55 - when hybrid programming hybrid you know
104:59 - mobile development started getting a lot
105:00 - of traction because
105:02 - other you know technologies like xamarin
105:04 - that were being used a lot of
105:06 - commercially
105:07 - actually didn't stick out that long so
105:09 - react native really gives the chance for
105:11 - hybrid mobile development to to come
105:13 - along and
105:14 - actually stay a little bit longer yeah
105:18 - really good point with xamarin by the
105:19 - way xamarin was really like
105:21 - it wasn't really pleasant to code in
105:22 - react it was much more of a better
105:24 - experience
105:25 - and it's quite powerful so definitely
105:27 - something to bear in mind guys like uh
105:29 - they learn over time right these things
105:31 - sort of they don't gain popularity for
105:32 - no reason
105:33 - they read that they are popular for a
105:35 - reason and uh it's definitely some it's
105:36 - a safe bet to go with react
105:38 - yeah cool there's a cool question here
105:40 - by monu such deva
105:42 - which says will dino js
105:45 - replace node.js what do you think about
105:48 - that i feel like we need to drop a video
105:50 - i feel like we need to drop a video
105:52 - around this because i see a lot of
105:53 - people asking yeah i'm curious as well
105:55 - so for those of you guys who don't know
105:56 - what dinojs is
105:58 - it's like so node.js is a runtime
106:01 - environment for javascript which is why
106:03 - you can run it on the the backend
106:05 - servers right so it's just an
106:06 - environment where you can run javascript
106:08 - now dino is essentially like a more
106:11 - modern it's newer it's more modern sort
106:13 - of runtime environment for javascript
106:15 - and the the difference here is that like
106:16 - one of the main differences
106:18 - is that out of the box it supports
106:20 - typescript so
106:21 - for those of you don't know what
106:22 - typescript is it's a sort of type
106:25 - definition um sort of uh
106:28 - they call it a superset it sits above
106:30 - javascript and allows you to say
106:32 - if a string is a string or if an integer
106:33 - is an integer as well as a bunch of
106:35 - other things
106:36 - i mean that allows your code to be more
106:37 - robust so will it take off i think so
106:41 - um but it's too early to tell um but in
106:43 - this like
106:44 - with all of this stuff guys it's like
106:45 - when react first view versus
106:47 - angular it's all going to take time and
106:49 - it's very opinionated
106:51 - is it worth learning i would say focus
106:52 - on node.js in my opinion
106:54 - yep awesome we got another comment here
106:58 - from shintan
106:59 - which says is flutter future proof
107:02 - i know flutter has been very popping
107:04 - very in inside of a lot of youtube
107:06 - videos a lot of youtube content i know
107:08 - cali halden
107:09 - made you know he made flutter one of the
107:12 - top
107:13 - five programming languages and flutter
107:15 - is developed by google what is your take
107:16 - on flutter sonny
107:19 - so flutter is actually something which
107:21 - i'm actually looking into learning right
107:23 - now
107:24 - um and kelly hayden's absolutely he's
107:26 - got some like banger videos right now
107:27 - with flutter
107:28 - um so i definitely go check him out if
107:29 - you're interested but um
107:31 - flyer is definitely it's got a lot of um
107:35 - it's got a lot of support right now um
107:37 - it has a lot of backing financially
107:39 - um i would i would say it's something
107:41 - which is a safe bet
107:43 - so we spoke about react native as being
107:45 - something which is quite like
107:46 - um quite good and it's going quite well
107:49 - but flutter
107:50 - right now is actually something which is
107:52 - very performant and it does really well
107:54 - in terms of like when you actually get
107:55 - up up up or up from running
107:57 - in in sort of flower but something to
107:59 - bear in mind guys
108:01 - you need to think about sort of your
108:02 - trade-offs here so flutter is also in a
108:04 - different language
108:05 - i think it's in dart flutter is um so
108:08 - when you want to sort of if you've only
108:10 - got a limited time
108:11 - learning something like javascript and
108:13 - also guys remember we just spoke about
108:15 - react versus angular the the sort of com
108:17 - what's similar between those two things
108:19 - they're both written in javascript
108:21 - right so javascript's a skill it's not
108:23 - only is going to allow you to learn like
108:24 - a bunch of
108:26 - valuable sort of things and you can do
108:27 - it on the front and back end but
108:29 - mobile development web development is a
108:32 - like in most popular library up and
108:33 - coming like
108:34 - i would stick with that as my sort of
108:37 - go-to
108:38 - in this sort of debate as opposed to
108:39 - just learning something which is kind of
108:41 - cool
108:41 - yeah that makes sense javascript is
108:43 - super versatile for whatever you want to
108:45 - do like you just
108:46 - mentioned you know front end back end
108:48 - anything related to the web it's insane
108:50 - now you know react native being able to
108:52 - even
108:53 - develop ios and even android apps you
108:56 - know hybrid
108:57 - mobile development that's insane so you
108:59 - know right now akshay does
109:01 - bring the question react versus flutter
109:03 - just because you know we like these
109:05 - these little verses type of questions
109:08 - i feel like they're kind of they give a
109:09 - huge insight to them what do you think
109:11 - about this
109:12 - exactly no no i definitely agree with
109:14 - that i definitely agree with that i
109:15 - think uh react versus flutter
109:17 - um react guys i'm gonna go with react
109:20 - because you can build websites you can
109:21 - build web uh
109:22 - web apps you can build ios native apps
109:25 - all from one code base which is amazing
109:27 - um leroy fernandez says a really nice
109:29 - coin he says
109:30 - sonny's amazing if only he could be a
109:32 - mentor to show the path engineering
109:33 - hardly teaches what actually matters
109:35 - guys so firstly thank you leroy we
109:37 - really appreciate uh
109:39 - like lovely comments like this and
109:40 - actually to answer your question

110:04 - your question yeah uh thank you
110:06 - and yeah i am a mentor
110:09 - awesome awesome yeah there's a lot of
110:11 - great mentors in profit with javascript
110:14 - not not only just a clever programmer
110:16 - team but we also have
110:17 - success coaches so success coaches are
110:19 - actually people from the community that
110:21 - are thriving in that community they
110:23 - actually have a great expertise in
110:25 - coding
110:25 - and we just bring them up in the
110:27 - community and make them leaders so
110:29 - they help other people in the community
110:31 - actually learn they do review their code
110:33 - they do teach them how to make their
110:35 - code more efficient how to implement
110:36 - things better all of these things are
110:38 - really part of profit with javascript
110:40 - like we were saying if you find this
110:41 - content valuable
110:42 - click the link in the description below
110:45 - and actually learn more about that
110:47 - specific you know product that we're
110:49 - offering to you guys just because
110:51 - like we said we've seen so many people
110:53 - change their lives by taking action
110:55 - and actually applying all of these
110:57 - principles being part of a community
110:59 - taking into account building a portfolio
111:02 - actually
111:02 - building projects that can be marketable
111:04 - and building all these skills all of
111:06 - those things are
111:07 - a sort of ecosystem that you surround
111:09 - yourself with so that you can thrive in
111:11 - a specific goal that you have that goal
111:13 - right now would be programming so that's
111:15 - completely awesome
111:16 - now we do have a question here by so
111:20 - and he asks which framework a beginner
111:24 - go through when it comes to python based
111:26 - like django or javascript based
111:28 - react js library so i think he's asking
111:31 - you know what what's a good framework
111:32 - for beginners
111:34 - when it comes to python maybe django or
111:36 - javascript
111:37 - you know using javascript maybe react.js
111:39 - library is a good thing to start as
111:41 - beginners what do you think about this
111:43 - sony
111:44 - yeah so i would say honestly i would
111:47 - definitely recommend
111:48 - react reason being is because like like
111:50 - i said guys compared to angular it's a
111:51 - library so it's actually like
111:53 - one they have a really really amazing
111:55 - tool called create react app which is
111:57 - pretty much
111:57 - one line of uh one line you run in the
111:59 - command line and it pretty much sets up
112:01 - your entire app gets the app running
112:03 - and that's it like you have a starter
112:05 - template up and running in like
112:06 - literally less than like three minutes
112:08 - which is insane and then all you need to
112:10 - do at that point is then just plug and
112:12 - play as you need things right
112:14 - you don't need to learn the entire way
112:16 - how react works or something like that
112:17 - as opposed to angular
112:18 - where you need to know everything before
112:20 - you can actually get something very
112:21 - small up and running so
112:23 - as a beginner i would definitely go for
112:25 - react.js yeah
112:26 - awesome looks like react.js is winning
112:28 - every battle just because
112:30 - of its versatility it's you know very
112:33 - easy way of
112:34 - being able to be digested and consumed
112:36 - and learn for beginners all these things
112:38 - now watch and learn only actually is
112:40 - asking
112:41 - how to understand that my vanilla
112:43 - vanilla js knowledge is enough for me to
112:45 - start learning react.js
112:48 - right really good question like we get
112:51 - it all the time in the coaching course
112:53 - um and i actually tell everyone like if
112:55 - you at this point can get a website up
112:58 - as in like when i literally a web page
113:00 - on the screen you can
113:02 - link your css to it you can link your
113:04 - javascript to it
113:06 - and you can pretty much write a function
113:07 - so when you click a button it launches
113:08 - your function or just says console.log
113:10 - something
113:11 - at that point guys what are you waiting
113:13 - for just go ahead and try to react like
113:14 - honestly just stop
113:15 - overthinking it it's not too complicated
113:17 - it's not too hard like
113:19 - just go ahead and get started so
113:20 - something i would recommend is like you
113:22 - literally go ahead and um
113:24 - is you just like if you're on the fence
113:26 - just give it a try just start use create
113:28 - react app it will make your life
113:30 - super simple especially when it comes to
113:32 - sort of getting involved in that
113:34 - and then starting off your journey but
113:35 - definitely um yeah something which you
113:37 - can get started with right now
113:38 - awesome guys i think we've hit a lot of
113:41 - questions now
113:42 - right now you know wrapping up
113:44 - everything these really were the five
113:46 - skills to learn if you want to become a
113:48 - self-taught
113:49 - developer in 2020 there is a lot of
113:52 - implications now you know it's
113:54 - a modern age all languages are getting
113:56 - modernized javascript is getting
113:57 - modernized with all of these new
113:59 - libraries
114:00 - these new frameworks this new way to
114:02 - applying to jobs right now it's an
114:03 - interesting time in the world you know
114:05 - you can get clients all over the world
114:07 - you can work with whatever company that
114:08 - you seem
114:10 - good fit with really and actually
114:12 - contribute to projects that are
114:15 - massive and even bigger than yourself so
114:17 - all these skills are super important
114:19 - you want to do a little a little summary
114:22 - of these skills saying
114:24 - yeah so like guys today we pretty much
114:26 - spoke about like the top
114:28 - five skills which uh you are gonna need
114:30 - to know as a self-taught developer
114:32 - to succeed um the first one was about
114:35 - all about communication
114:36 - how interpersonal skills and non-social
114:38 - are both huge
114:39 - and that includes soft skills like the
114:41 - ability to write emails blogs mediums
114:43 - basically communicate effectively not
114:45 - just in your technical skills
114:47 - but like in actually communicating with
114:49 - your team members how do you manage your
114:51 - time
114:51 - how do you handle sort of leadership
114:54 - roles and things like that right
114:55 - we spoke about that we also spoke about
114:57 - how to find yourself how to improve
114:59 - those odds
114:59 - by finding yourself mentor by doing
115:01 - things like reading medium articles etc
115:04 - then we spoke about number two which was
115:06 - learning how to learn
115:07 - right we spoke about time management
115:09 - productivity hacks how to handle
115:12 - the stress and anxiety of the sort of
115:15 - natural pitfalls of what seems to happen
115:17 - when you sort of start that development
115:18 - journey like when you get stuck on a
115:20 - problem
115:20 - and you can't figure it out we talked
115:22 - about how you can find your learning
115:24 - style
115:24 - how the ability to google is huge and
115:27 - how that's going to pretty much
115:28 - determine like your success as a
115:29 - developer because literally it's going
115:30 - to be something which is going to stick
115:32 - with you
115:32 - um throughout your your sort of coding
115:35 - journey
115:35 - um we gave you a bunch of tips and
115:37 - tricks on optimizing your workflow so
115:39 - you can have a bit of fun with that
115:40 - and also guys like creating an online
115:42 - presence and community and so forth
115:44 - number three we spoke about was
115:47 - debugging guys debugging is
115:49 - massively important it's something which
115:51 - you guys are all going to be stuck in
115:53 - for a very long time
115:54 - uh throughout your sort of journey and
115:56 - it's something which you want you want
115:57 - to become friends with debugging you
115:58 - want to become friends with that sort of
116:00 - pain
116:00 - and that sort of um and guys stop
116:03 - comparing to like the senior developers
116:05 - you will get there
116:06 - it just takes that sort of discipline
116:07 - and sort of building up uh sort of in
116:09 - your journey and then remember guys
116:11 - number four was developing a programmers
116:13 - mindset so develop that mindset
116:15 - we spoke about frankie dropped a bunch
116:17 - of value bombs about like
116:18 - how your attitude affects your behavior
116:20 - and that leads to sort of action results
116:22 - and then in turn
116:23 - you performing better in your role and
116:25 - how that's like a circular motion
116:27 - we spoke about those things and like
116:29 - getting involved in conferences
116:30 - you know like get a part of that build
116:32 - your portfolio do those things and then
116:34 - number five
116:35 - we spoke about get and why it's so
116:37 - massively important
116:39 - to land a job um because it's something
116:41 - which you're going to need in pretty
116:42 - much every workplace
116:45 - it's going to it's going to most
116:46 - companies use it like if they don't
116:48 - remember you don't really
116:49 - kind of want to be part compile
116:50 - companies like that um you and you need
116:52 - it to contribute to open source
116:54 - projects so guys massive massive
116:57 - amount of value and and knowledge that
116:59 - was dropped during this session if you
117:00 - guys found it useful
117:02 - smash the thumbs up and guys can we just
117:04 - drop like some
117:05 - fire right now in the comment section
117:07 - because like and this is all goes
117:09 - towards frankie because this session was
117:11 - super valuable
117:12 - and it's been frankie's first live and i
117:14 - think he's crushed it here guys and if
117:16 - you guys agree with that
117:17 - like drop him some comments and just
117:18 - like he has exactly rush
117:21 - this live stream like you guys have
117:22 - crushed this live stream this is like
117:24 - one of the best ones
117:26 - we have ever done on this channel thank
117:27 - you guys and like i can tell everybody's
117:29 - getting value
117:30 - you guys almost broke uh almost 10 000
117:34 - people have watched this so far which is
117:35 - insane and you guys have been sticking
117:38 - around the entire time like it has never
117:41 - dropped below certain and i'm even
117:42 - looking at chat it's going crazy
117:44 - the value bombs in this one were amazing
117:47 - guys
117:47 - should frankie come back on this
117:49 - platform to speak
117:51 - you let us know tell us in the comments
117:53 - below

117:56 - discuss a lot of things
117:57 - it's it's insane man a lot of factors a
117:59 - lot of skills
118:00 - it's cool because everything is just
118:02 - coming together now you know you guys
118:04 - are killers
118:05 - in programming you guys are killers and
118:06 - communication i mean honestly the whole
118:08 - team is and it's really a privilege to
118:10 - be able to share this knowledge with
118:12 - hundreds hundreds hundreds and even
118:14 - thousands of people man
118:15 - it really is a privilege it really does
118:17 - humble me thank you guys for being here
118:19 - you know all of these skills all of
118:20 - these factors we do teach them in profit
118:22 - with javascript
118:23 - which you know we really want to make
118:25 - the community massive we really want to
118:27 - bring
118:27 - value to the masses and actually make
118:30 - programming fun
