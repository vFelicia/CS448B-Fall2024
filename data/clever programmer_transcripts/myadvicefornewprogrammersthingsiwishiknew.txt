00:00 - to new programmers after coding for a
00:02 - couple of years
00:04 - it's a video that i got inspired to do
00:06 - because of fahad imran and i just came
00:08 - across his blog post
00:10 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
00:11 - take some of his important bullet points
00:13 - and speak from my experience on them
00:16 - number one focus on the fundamentals so
00:19 - i have to agree with fahad on this
00:22 - so many developers i see always trying
00:24 - to learn the hottest technology
00:26 - the newest framework the coolest
00:29 - thing that is happening around them they
00:32 - want to pick up react
00:34 - and on day two they want to pick up
00:35 - redux and then they want to go and learn
00:38 - see and then they want to learn what's
00:40 - angular about
00:42 - what's the difference between view then
00:43 - they want to start looking up cloud
00:45 - computing
00:46 - they want to look up the difference
00:47 - between firebase and aws
00:50 - stop focus on the fundamentals if you
00:53 - get the fundamentals right
00:55 - you solve everything get strong
00:59 - fundamentals and develop a strong
01:01 - ability to problem solve
01:03 - even when you try to apply to companies
01:05 - online
01:06 - you will see that they are looking
01:07 - mainly for somebody who is framework
01:09 - agnostic even if you
01:11 - apply to a react.js developer job number
01:13 - two
01:14 - please make lots of mistakes get good at
01:18 - making mistakes enjoy the process
01:21 - of messing up then starting over
01:24 - then doing it again the only true way to
01:27 - learn
01:28 - is to learn all the things you shouldn't
01:31 - do
01:32 - that's what leads to mastery number
01:34 - three
01:35 - stop relying on a single source of
01:37 - knowledge
01:38 - now whether this is college or a coding
01:42 - boot camp
01:43 - or some tutorial or youtube channel you
01:46 - find online
01:47 - don't rely on only one source
01:50 - go through a ton of different resources
01:53 - come to your own conclusions
01:56 - number four don't fall into tutorial
01:59 - hell
01:59 - you're going through course after course
02:02 - you're following what they're saying on
02:03 - free code camp
02:04 - on udacity on udemy on youtube on medium
02:08 - wherever it may be you're moving in
02:10 - circles
02:11 - you keep going from one tutorial to the
02:13 - next without making
02:15 - true forward progress what does true
02:17 - forward progress looks like
02:20 - it looks like you going out there in the
02:22 - field building
02:24 - projects completing them and putting
02:26 - them on your portfolio
02:28 - until you complete projects that you put
02:29 - on your portfolio you are not making
02:31 - forward progress
02:34 - number five stop trying to master
02:36 - everything
02:37 - you're not gonna learn every language
02:39 - every framework every technology
02:41 - it's not gonna happen pick one master it
02:44 - get good at it
02:45 - keep building things with it make it
02:47 - useful
02:48 - think about why you learn different
02:51 - languages
02:52 - english mandarin urdu hindi
02:56 - whatever the language may be why do
02:58 - people learn it
02:59 - well you don't just learn a language
03:02 - just so you can learn a language unless
03:04 - you're a polyglot the reason why you
03:06 - learn languages
03:07 - is so you can live in that country you
03:09 - can talk to the people you can date
03:11 - somebody
03:11 - you can get a job
03:14 - that's the point where you should be
03:16 - learning programming languages not so
03:17 - you could learn every programming
03:18 - language on the planet
03:20 - but you could so you could learn a
03:22 - language build things with it
03:23 - get a job with it make a career out of
03:26 - it solve
03:27 - problems help businesses help people
03:29 - [Music]
03:31 - so don't be a programming language [ __ ]
