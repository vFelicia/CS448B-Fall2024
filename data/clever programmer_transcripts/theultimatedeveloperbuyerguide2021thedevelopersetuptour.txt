00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - what's up you guys how's it going it's
00:07 - david here from cleverprogrammer.com
00:10 - and we are live
00:13 - one of the most requested videos out
00:16 - there
00:16 - ever uh and i personally got a ton
00:20 - of messages regarding this topic what am
00:23 - i using
00:24 - what are we using uh what sorts of tools
00:28 - uh are we actually building our stuff
00:31 - with what are we
00:33 - using inside of clever programmer
00:36 - so that is exactly what i am going to be
00:39 - talking about
00:40 - today so with that said let's drop a
00:44 - comment where are you coming in
00:46 - where are you checking in welcome
00:47 - everybody to the stream
00:50 - and once again this is one of the most
00:53 - requested topics
00:55 - what are we using how are we building
00:57 - our stuff
00:59 - what is the tools that you should be
01:01 - investing into
01:02 - and not spending your money on
01:06 - dumb stuff what's up hello everybody
01:09 - hey planet hey wonder code what's up
01:12 - lean blue
01:14 - happy birthday for you tomorrow amazing
01:17 - it's amazing we are 40 people strong in
01:20 - one and a half minutes
01:22 - that's good and we are getting started
01:26 - in just a second so are you guys excited
01:30 - about this
01:31 - who is excited let me know in the chat
01:34 - what's up live to code hashtag ltc
01:37 - how's it going bro
01:42 - all right so before we actually gonna
01:45 - get go ahead and get started i amazing i
01:48 - see those likes
01:50 - going up keep it that way because the
01:53 - best way
01:54 - that you can become a developer is that
01:57 - you go ahead and smash that like button
01:59 - without question
02:00 - amazing super pumped awesome
02:04 - hey what's up how you guys doing we are
02:08 - at 42 people are the tools going to be
02:10 - very expensive or
02:12 - like on a budget good question i forgot
02:13 - to say that so
02:16 - some of them are going to be expensive
02:19 - some of them are going to be free
02:21 - we kind of try to balance between these
02:24 - and
02:24 - just give you guys an idea of what to be
02:27 - expected
02:28 - um i just wanted to keep it super clear
02:31 - we are trying to keep things uh as
02:35 - free and as cheap as possible because
02:37 - nobody wants to break their bank
02:39 - just to become a developer right there
02:41 - are like smarter investments and there
02:43 - are on smart investments so first thing
02:45 - first i want to clear this
02:46 - up uh the tools
02:51 - don't matter as much as the skills
02:54 - if you were to invest in your skills or
02:57 - in your tools
02:58 - or buying your new computer or buying a
03:00 - course
03:01 - obviously go with the course the reason
03:03 - being
03:04 - is that if you go with the new computer
03:08 - that's not gonna make you money obvious
03:09 - ultimately you're gonna be coding on
03:11 - that
03:11 - but that's not gonna make you that much
03:13 - cash so you always want to
03:15 - invest in for growth right all right
03:18 - uh
03:22 - amazing firebase is one of them probably
03:24 - that's a good catch
03:25 - but actually we're we are talking about
03:28 - stuff that support
03:30 - you while programming so with that said
03:33 - let's jump into
03:34 - the presentation wrong screen haha
03:38 - so first up
03:39 - [Music]
03:42 - uh i just want to welcome everybody to
03:44 - the ultimate buyer guide 2021
03:47 - what tools and tech i need to invest or
03:50 - spend money on okay invest
03:53 - in all right let's take a look at those
03:56 - comments okay
03:57 - amazing so yeah once again
04:00 - one of the most requested highest
04:02 - requested uh
04:03 - topics to talk about so yeah let's get
04:06 - started
04:08 - first thing first it is time to focus
04:12 - drop your phone aways it's going to be a
04:14 - fast short live
04:16 - amazing lean blue uh welcome to your
04:19 - first live
04:21 - and is learning ai easy it depends
04:24 - right we got uh content on that all
04:27 - right so time to focus
04:29 - put your phone away put the do not
04:30 - disturb on
04:32 - this is the time just give me these uh
04:35 - 30 minutes and we will be
04:36 - done with it all right so i'm gonna turn
04:40 - on my fancy pointer
04:42 - first thing that i get asked the most is
04:45 - a laptop
04:46 - or a desktop all right um
04:50 - this is kind of like how i think desktop
04:53 - is beating laptops by the way
04:56 - so my recommendation if you're going for
04:58 - a laptop you definitely want to check
05:01 - out
05:01 - the m1 macbook pro this is not sponsored
05:05 - by apple
05:05 - at all but i just kind of believe in
05:07 - their stuff
05:08 - especially with their new m1 chip it is
05:11 - the best that you can invest
05:13 - into and it's so so powerful
05:16 - obviously all our stuff we at cover
05:20 - programmer we use macbooks
05:21 - uh and imac so that's something to keep
05:25 - in mind
05:26 - this is an amazing stuff oh yeah
05:30 - yeah okay all right next up if you're
05:32 - buying
05:33 - a laptop be sure to invest in an
05:36 - external fan the reason being is that
05:38 - this these things are getting
05:40 - hot and you want to keep them cool
05:42 - otherwise they will throttle back on
05:44 - their performance
05:45 - this is probably one of the easiest one
05:47 - to get and the best one to get
05:49 - it has five different fans so yes that's
05:52 - uh
05:54 - that's something that you want to uh go
05:57 - for
05:58 - so you say but they're pretty expensive
06:00 - that is 100
06:01 - right however you are investing into it
06:04 - for the next
06:05 - five seven years and if you break it
06:07 - down
06:08 - it's it's not even that uh that
06:11 - expensive
06:12 - and because of macbooks uh apple's
06:15 - new stuff you will need a usb
06:18 - c doc bot then you can pretty much
06:20 - customize whatever you want to plug into
06:23 - your computer
06:24 - okay h prevents programming
06:27 - or sailor nope it doesn't at all we have
06:30 - students
06:31 - uh ranging from 11 years old all the way
06:35 - up to 50 plus all right let's go and
06:38 - let's jump back so my recommendation for
06:41 - a desktop uh is obviously going to be
06:45 - the
06:45 - m1 mac mini once again because of the
06:49 - amazing
06:50 - uh computer that they built together
06:54 - that
06:54 - powerhouse is just the best bang for
06:56 - your buck
06:57 - all right specifications you will need
07:00 - at least 16 gigs of ram
07:04 - if you are not buying an m1 mac
07:08 - uh in nowadays world for the m1 buyers
07:11 - eight gigabyte is going to be enough
07:13 - once you are firing up a react app is
07:15 - going to kill all your ram
07:17 - and going to use a ton of resources
07:19 - because you are
07:20 - doing some heavy coding stuff and all
07:23 - these
07:23 - development environments actually take
07:26 - up a ton of resource
07:28 - um take up a ton
07:31 - of your computer
07:35 - uh yeah okay
07:38 - next up you definitely want to protect
07:41 - your eyes i'm not wearing it at this
07:43 - moment but
07:44 - i have a blue light glass
07:47 - if you become a student of ours i may
07:50 - show it how i look like in glasses but
07:54 - you definitely want to invest in a blue
07:56 - light glass it just uh
07:58 - keeps the blue light uh out of your eyes
08:01 - and you will be able to
08:04 - sleep better at night and all these kind
08:05 - of stuff so make sure to protect your
08:07 - eyes
08:08 - you are working with screens all around
08:10 - the place so that's something to keep
08:12 - an eye on pun intended
08:15 - ultra wide monitor the ultrawide monitor
08:19 - is one of the best investments uh that
08:22 - you can
08:23 - probably make and one of the best
08:25 - inventions that people made
08:28 - because you can get so many things done
08:30 - just by having an ultra wide
08:32 - and even a second screen so if you're if
08:35 - you're lower on budget you definitely
08:36 - want to get
08:37 - at least two three monitors but if
08:40 - if you can go for a bigger ultrawide
08:43 - monitor go for it
08:44 - it pays for itself the amount of
08:47 - productivity that you will be able
08:49 - that you will be blessed with just by
08:51 - having so many stuff
08:52 - open and being able to
08:56 - go all around the place just with a
08:58 - click
08:59 - it's going to pay for itself in terms of
09:04 - price all right you don't want to
09:07 - jeep out on your back but your back is
09:10 - going to get
09:11 - go is the number one thing your spines
09:14 - need to be
09:15 - aligned in place what kazi uses in his
09:19 - studio is this
09:20 - gt or racing chair this is probably a
09:24 - higher end something
09:26 - uh you can get this for a few hundred
09:29 - dollars but
09:30 - this is the ultimate thing you should be
09:33 - doing if you are just
09:34 - starting out or you're kind of like at
09:37 - the beginning
09:38 - you probably want to go with something
09:39 - like this make sure to have
09:41 - a head rest like i do make sure to have
09:44 - proper
09:45 - backrest like i like this one has lumbar
09:48 - support
09:49 - is super important and you definitely
09:51 - want to have
09:52 - these arms over here all right
09:56 - armrests over here okay nice chair
09:59 - super important don't cheap out on that
10:02 - because you will be sitting in this
10:03 - thing
10:04 - a lot so that's something to keep an eye
10:07 - on
10:07 - all right next up standing desks
10:11 - it is uh a little less important than
10:14 - having a good chair
10:16 - but having a standing desk has changed
10:19 - my life and so many people out there
10:23 - so a standing desk is actually something
10:25 - that you can go ahead press the button
10:27 - and it's just gonna raise up
10:28 - that way you can be standing and working
10:31 - once again for your back for your legs
10:34 - and you can just move around
10:36 - have a uh little bit of movement all the
10:38 - way
10:39 - so that's something once again and you
10:42 - and even if you have an apple watch it
10:44 - will
10:44 - actually warn you every single hour
10:47 - that you should be jumping around a
10:49 - little just to get your bloodstream
10:52 - uh flowing around so that's once again
10:55 - important thing
10:55 - don't cheap out on that
10:59 - let's get to the softwares because
11:00 - that's literally the most requested
11:03 - stuff
11:04 - uh that you were asking me about so
11:07 - softwares that that will level
11:10 - up your game
11:13 - prototyping tools sketch this one
11:16 - is a paid software it's i think uh
11:20 - there is student pricing available it i
11:23 - think they
11:24 - drop it off 40 i got it with student
11:27 - pricing this is an amazing tool
11:30 - i'm literally not using anything else
11:31 - for prototyping
11:33 - whenever i build some custom stuff i
11:35 - always go
11:36 - into sketch first and then just sketch
11:38 - it out
11:39 - pun intended once again figma
11:42 - free version of sketch
11:46 - knows almost everything as sketch
11:49 - but it's free it's an amazing tool
11:53 - and you can you can pretty much do
11:56 - almost ever anything
11:57 - uh that you can do with sketch however
11:59 - sketch has a little more plugins and
12:02 - just
12:03 - those little details that make a
12:05 - software different
12:07 - all right and adobe xd once again a
12:12 - freemium software i think i honestly i
12:15 - hate adobe
12:16 - stuff but uh some people in the team and
12:19 - a lot of my developer
12:21 - uh peers that i know use
12:24 - adobe xd so that's once again that
12:26 - something you can
12:28 - use and actually the more of this you're
12:30 - familiar with
12:31 - the more kinds of software that you can
12:33 - build and and the more kinds of designs
12:36 - and prototypes that you can create
12:38 - and actually the more kinds of
12:41 - clients you are going to be compatible
12:43 - with because they might as well just
12:45 - send you a photoshop file and then
12:47 - you cannot open them in either sketch
12:49 - nor figma
12:50 - you will need to use adobe xd
12:54 - terminal this is the fanciest stuff
12:57 - uh you guys are interested in hold on a
13:00 - sec
13:02 - uh let me go ahead and open up my
13:04 - terminal
13:05 - real quick so this is the thing that i
13:08 - actually use
13:09 - and we here at clever programmer use if
13:12 - i i can just go into my local
13:14 - uh git version control and that that's
13:18 - actually
13:18 - where all my folders are and i can just
13:21 - list all these stuff and it looks super
13:23 - nice
13:24 - and if i were to go into uh the twitch
13:26 - clone say
13:28 - which we actually built on this channel
13:30 - and
13:31 - let's say what we have in here so once
13:33 - again twitch clone
13:35 - uh come on
13:39 - jesus okay i have some nested stuff in
13:43 - there
13:45 - bang it actually shows the git version
13:48 - control over here
13:50 - uh this was actually initialized before
13:52 - github
13:53 - uh and all these git version control
13:55 - software is refined that the
13:57 - uh the default branch is not going to be
14:00 - master anymore and
14:02 - calling it master is discontinued now we
14:04 - are calling it main but this was
14:06 - uh actually initialized before that time
14:09 - so
14:09 - yep and that's something to uh look out
14:12 - to plus
14:13 - it will make you super cool and just
14:16 - popping this up in a cafe will just make
14:19 - you look so much more professional
14:21 - and will honestly this was the software
14:24 - that weighed me made me want to use
14:26 - terminal
14:26 - all right next up i term 2. i personally
14:29 - don't use this
14:30 - but uh i i just use the built in
14:33 - uh mac software but i haven't
14:37 - uh actually tested this out yet but i am
14:40 - planning to transition over to item 2
14:42 - because it actually
14:44 - just takes everything to another level
14:46 - the oh my zsh
14:48 - is uh amazing by itself and it just can
14:50 - be put into whichever
14:53 - terminal you're already using
14:56 - but but item just takes everything to
14:58 - another level
15:00 - and git version control definitely
15:03 - something
15:04 - i'm not even sure why it's in the
15:05 - terminal whatever it's in
15:08 - it's over here anyways get version
15:10 - control you don't want to miss out on
15:12 - productivity apps notion of
15:15 - hold on notion notion is the
15:19 - number one productivity app that you
15:22 - will use
15:23 - this is literally my notion that i use
15:27 - and this is actually uh the youtube
15:30 - report this is pretty much
15:31 - those videos that i uh did
15:36 - yesterday and two days before that i
15:39 - think
15:40 - and those are given to our professional
15:43 - editor
15:44 - kyle who will actually just chop it up
15:46 - and i will be uploading them
15:48 - i think he even actually finished those
15:50 - so it's just me
15:51 - who needs to upload it anyways
15:55 - notion 100 recommended uh
15:58 - it is free once again it is free by the
16:01 - way all the terminal stuff
16:02 - is free free for free 3.99
16:06 - and you can actually go ahead grab them
16:09 - download them
16:10 - and just be more productive because at
16:12 - the end of the day you will save time
16:13 - and the more time you save the more time
16:16 - you will have to take on
16:17 - more projects which will ultimately make
16:19 - you more money
16:22 - again uh productivity app another one
16:26 - is alfred it is actually on my main
16:29 - screen now but
16:30 - if you know this thing
16:34 - this one on steroids i can search up my
16:37 - contacts i can search up
16:39 - files on my machine makes it so much
16:42 - faster
16:42 - and you can just build so uh workflows
16:45 - in there so i just
16:46 - type in a comment and it will just
16:48 - execute it so basically when i turn on
16:50 - my computer i just type in
16:52 - alfred started or something like that
16:54 - and it would just open up all my used
16:56 - application that i already use and
16:58 - integrated with
16:58 - a few more applications and everything
17:01 - is just going to be in place
17:02 - just how i left it the night before and
17:05 - i actually turned off my computer
17:08 - because of that
17:10 - dropler dropper is your number one
17:14 - uh screenshot application i wanted to
17:18 - say it so fast
17:19 - so if i hold down option shift and three
17:23 - and then just highlight this area it
17:25 - will open
17:27 - this window up i can mark up
17:30 - super fast i think it's actually uh
17:33 - paid by the way and i can point and
17:36 - click around this
17:37 - screenshot now why is this important you
17:39 - might be asking because it
17:41 - actually a screen shot up like who
17:42 - cannot annotate a screenshot right
17:45 - makes you fast and actually it will
17:48 - generate a link for you that you can
17:50 - share towards your clients this is
17:52 - something that we use inside of
17:54 - cleverprogrammer
17:55 - and makes us work 10x
17:58 - if not more faster 10x faster just
18:02 - because we
18:03 - take screenshots so much faster and we
18:05 - just point around and
18:06 - everybody knows where to look and even
18:09 - on a webpage or something that i have
18:12 - never ever
18:13 - seen before i can just look around just
18:16 - because i have the arrows and
18:18 - all those annotations in there
18:21 - all right loom same thing
18:25 - but with video uh only
18:28 - drawback you cannot annotate but anyways
18:32 - super fast and it will actually upload
18:34 - while you are recording it will record
18:36 - your screen
18:36 - yourself and you can by the way turn it
18:39 - off if you want don't want to record
18:40 - yourself
18:42 - but we'll make your life so much faster
18:44 - because while you're recording it is
18:46 - actually
18:46 - uploading so super fast again and it
18:49 - will just give you
18:50 - a link that you can share with your
18:52 - clients
18:54 - now coming back to the first topic that
18:56 - we had and this is the end
18:59 - do you actually need to upgrade if you
19:02 - are have a good enough stuff
19:05 - that is just working the answer is

19:12 - skill set
