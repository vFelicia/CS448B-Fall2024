06:07 - okay let's say you are programmer you
06:08 - want to be a programming or watching
06:10 - this like Kazi how the hell is this
06:12 - helpful for me
06:14 - here's how this can be really helpful
06:15 - for you okay one of the best ways to get
06:18 - job opportunities LAN job opportunities
06:20 - is not always hiding behind
06:22 - ten look cool or like github or Twitter
06:25 - or Facebook that's not the only place
06:27 - you can try to get jobs or sending our
06:29 - resumes on indeed and monster one of the
06:31 - best ways to get job opportunities and
06:33 - the most guaranteed way there's actually
06:35 - meet people in person even if you're not
06:37 - like the best developer in the world if
06:39 - you see people in person meet them make
06:41 - it leave a good impression on them dear
06:43 - and you didn't know you're a Python
06:44 - programmer they're much more likely to
06:46 - go with somebody that they know trust
06:48 - and like rather than some online resume
06:51 - this way you can skip the line get ahead
06:53 - okay I'm not saying you still need to
06:55 - have skills but this is one very great
06:58 - way to get more job opportunities so if
07:00 - you watch this video maybe there are
07:02 - some parts where you saw me just jumping
07:04 - into a conversation and like talking to
07:06 - people so when you go to these events
07:08 - you don't have to be so like you're
07:09 - standing in the corner like hanging out
07:11 - which is actually what I used to do but
07:13 - it's a lot of fun it's like a playground
07:15 - right you just go and meet people and
07:17 - talk about anything that you want it
07:19 - really does not matter what the heck you
07:21 - actually talk about okay as long as
07:22 - you're talking or sharing something that
07:24 - you're passionate about that's kind of
07:25 - the most important thing so when you go
07:27 - to these events like let's say a Python
07:29 - meetup okay if your app I want to be a
07:31 - Python programmer come to PyCon I'm
07:33 - going to be going to Pike on this year
07:34 - as well so you're gonna see me there
07:36 - meeting with a lot of people and if you
07:38 - want help I can also help you introduce
07:39 - yourself to a lot of other people okay
07:41 - and just have a great time connect with
07:44 - people there builds real relationships
07:46 - have genuine conversation but don't be
07:48 - just like a sleazy salesman with your
07:51 - card and just like giving it to
07:52 - everybody like here's a business card
07:54 - here's a business card you want this
07:56 - business card oh don't do that go have a
07:58 - good conversation have fun get to the
08:01 - other person something interesting
