00:00 - - Hey guys, what's up?
00:01 - How's it going.
00:02 - This is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com,
and in this video,
00:06 - I wanna talk about where
do you go and find clients.
00:10 - So without any further ado,
let's jump right into it.
00:14 - (upbeat electronic music)
00:26 - Okay, so I get this a lot.
00:28 - Qazi, where do I go and find good clients?
00:31 - Well, it's just like
00:32 - if I could give you relationship advice.
00:34 - I can tell you to just go on
like match.com or something
00:37 - and find somebody, and just
like that, for freelancing,
00:39 - I can tell you, just go on
upwork.com and find somebody.
00:42 - So there you go.
00:43 - But it's really not about going out
00:46 - and randomly finding these people.
00:48 - If you had to find somebody,
the love of your life,
00:50 - a lot of you guys would probably do that
00:52 - in real life without looking up online,
00:55 - and it doesn't just happen magically.
00:57 - It happens when you have
that mind shift that changes.
01:00 - For example, what's a really good way
01:02 - to attract a ton of negative people?
01:05 - Be negative.
01:07 - Do you agree?
01:08 - What is a really good way to attract a lot
01:11 - of high-performing, excellent,
and motivated, driven people?
01:19 - Be motivated, be driven, be excellent.
01:22 - So, if you wanna attract
premium clients, good clients,
01:28 - what's the first step that
you might need to take?
01:32 - You might yourself need to become
01:34 - a good client, a premium client.
01:38 - Imagine the time that somebody
was working under you,
01:41 - whether it was they
were doing some painting
01:45 - in your house for you, they
were fixing your tire for you.
01:48 - We've all had people who've worked for us.
01:51 - How were you to them?
01:52 - Were you nickel and diming
them every step of the way?
01:56 - Were you giving them the benefit
01:57 - of the doubt in different situations?
01:59 - Were you being nice to them?
02:01 - Were you even having a
conversation with them
02:03 - and treating them like
they were human beings?
02:06 - Not just like, you're
just painting this, okay,
02:08 - go ahead, you do this, I'm
gonna go in another room.
02:10 - Like were you actually,
did you have a conversation
02:12 - with them, did you talk with them?
02:14 - First of all, define
02:15 - what that premium client will do for you.
02:18 - So in your head, think about,
if I had a great client,
02:22 - they wouldn't even question
about paying me my price.
02:26 - One of the things.
02:28 - Another one of the things
that could be important is,
02:31 - I would have a great time with them.
02:35 - It wouldn't feel like I always
02:37 - need to prove something to them.
02:39 - We would have a good time.
02:41 - Number three, I would be challenged.
02:46 - I might be being pushed to my limits
02:48 - with what we're doing, the
projects that we're working on.
02:51 - Now, reverse engineer that.
02:53 - First, focus on becoming
a good client for people.
02:57 - It might mean you hiring other people to,
02:59 - I don't know, tutor you.
03:00 - You can hire somebody to tutor you
03:02 - for like seven dollars an
hour in let's say, art.
03:05 - Whatever it is that
you're currently doing.
03:08 - But start becoming a more
premium client with them,
03:11 - if your budget doesn't fit somebody
03:14 - at a higher paying level.
03:16 - And once you can start to do that,
03:18 - you're developing something very special,
03:20 - which is you yourself
03:22 - are turning into that ideal
client that you wanna be,
03:24 - and now what's gonna happen,
03:26 - you're gonna start attracting
those types of clients.
03:29 - And when I say attract, people think that
03:31 - you're gonna be like this magnet.
03:32 - You're gonna be sitting in this one place,
03:34 - and all of these amazing people
03:36 - are just gonna be falling in your lap.
03:37 - That doesn't happen.
03:39 - But what will happen is
that you'll know what to see
03:42 - in those people before you
invest your time with them.
03:47 - It won't be somebody just
really needs your help
03:49 - and you help them and they
never had the money to pay you.
03:53 - So you're the one getting the short end
03:55 - of the stick here for example.
03:57 - But if you turn into that
great client for other people,
04:00 - now, when you go looking
for other clients,
04:01 - you'll identify those key factors,
04:05 - because you yourself are that person.
04:08 - What are you good at in life?
04:10 - I am good at chess.
04:11 - Sometimes, I can see
a person in their face
04:14 - and tell how good they would be at chess
04:16 - or just talk with them a little bit
04:18 - and be able to determine how
good they would be at chess
04:20 - or play chess just for a little bit.
04:23 - If I play chess with them for five seconds
04:24 - or just hear a few words, even that,
04:27 - I can detect what their ability is.
04:29 - The same thing for computer programming.
04:31 - So when I'm hiring people,
working with people,
04:33 - it's very easy for me to figure out
04:35 - whether this person is gonna be
04:36 - the right fit for the company or not.
04:39 - In your case, the same scenario.
04:42 - If you want those things,
you gotta be that thing.
04:44 - It makes it a heck of a lot easier
04:46 - to find those things.
04:48 - So there is no one hub, these
clients are just sitting,
04:52 - swimming, and you just go there
and grab them by the hands.
04:56 - You should ask yourself, how
do I become a premium client,
05:00 - and then you can start attracting them.
05:02 - So whether it's for Python
software development
05:06 - and you wanna be consultant and
you wanna get these clients,
05:08 - or whether it is for something
completely different,
05:11 - you wanna work as a web
developer in Javascript,
05:15 - same rules apply for you.
05:17 - So, this is something that's applicable
05:20 - throughout different industries even.
05:23 - Different programming languages.
05:25 - Okay?
05:26 - It's kind of like a universal rule.
05:28 - Understand people.
05:29 - That's it, guys.
05:30 - That's it for this video.
05:31 - Thank you, as always,
so much for watching.
05:34 - I love your faces off, and
I'll see you in the next video.
