12:48 - yes okay sir exactly yes
12:51 - let's go all right guys full on let's go
12:54 - ahead and get started
12:55 - with with our application
12:58 - today all right so let's finish this up
13:01 - we are very very much close what do we
13:03 - do yesterday well
13:04 - yesterday what we did is very very cool
13:06 - right because what happened
13:07 - is we have this application looks a
13:10 - little bit kind of like this right
13:12 - and as you can see this allows us well
13:13 - we can go to the cart page we can
13:15 - you know go to the car and so forth so
13:17 - it's pretty pretty cool
13:18 - right now i can add the card which
13:20 - increases my number of items to 23 to 23
13:23 - as you can see right here
13:25 - but now i want to take a step further
13:27 - and now let's go ahead and go to the
13:28 - next section which is going to be okay
13:31 - let's do this the next part is you see
13:34 - this card
13:34 - see this card it says four but
13:36 - technically you should say a lot mark
13:38 - right because look at this we have
13:39 - quantity here
13:40 - quantity here doesn't make sense correct
13:42 - so like we should technically get
13:44 - the quantity right here right yes or no
13:47 - correct
13:48 - of course yes so what we want to do is
13:50 - actually be able to
13:51 - get get the what's it called get the
13:54 - actual card
13:55 - get count of the card now to get count
13:58 - how do you think that should happen like
14:00 - in order to get the count let's think
14:01 - about this here for a second okay
14:02 - i want to get this count here okay guys
14:05 - think about this
14:06 - what do i need to do well we have these
14:08 - card items
14:10 - right right multiple car items correct
14:13 - we have the quantities for them right
14:15 - here right
14:16 - so if what if what if we think about
14:18 - this right just think of su
14:19 - this is called pseudocode guys this is
14:21 - called pseudocode right
14:23 - right so for example in order for us to
14:24 - get the card the the full
14:26 - so let me see let's think about this get
14:30 - uh let me see get
14:33 - cart what git card items uh get
14:37 - card count get card count right
14:40 - and so to get that really what do we
14:42 - have to do well what get all the items
14:44 - all the card items correct okay what
14:48 - else do you guys think right
14:49 - right so so then what for each card item
14:55 - card you get the quantity right
14:58 - right add the quantity
15:01 - quan to t to the what to the to the what
15:06 - to the total of card items correct
15:09 - to of card count there you go
15:13 - it's honestly that simple guys right
15:16 - literally look at this
15:16 - we have john just done a very very what
15:19 - a very a very kind of simple
15:21 - you know it's called pseudocode right
15:22 - you went from get card count get all the
15:24 - card items right there i spell
15:26 - items wrong but that's okay then right
15:29 - so we get all the card items now for
15:31 - each
15:31 - card item all we do is add the quantity
15:34 - to the total the card count right
15:36 - so that's pretty much it guys so let's
15:37 - not think about this all right let's
15:40 - think about this i'm gonna
15:41 - remove this stuff awesome so let's do
15:43 - that right now now
15:45 - to be able to actually fully what to let
15:47 - me oh
15:48 - right there to fully show that number
15:50 - properly what do you think that we
15:52 - should
15:52 - show that and which in which store and
15:54 - where because i know where it should be
15:56 - what do you think david huh
15:57 - what do you think i mean i would put it
16:00 - in the head there
16:01 - oh oh no how does good is good
16:05 - you smart david they're is smart guys
16:07 - right put on the comments if they be
16:09 - smart guys you guys think they're very
16:10 - smart i think so too
16:11 - sometimes most of times yes go
16:14 - on so guys as we thought about this
16:17 - if we go to the header right let's go
16:19 - ahead and create a function called get
16:20 - count okay let me go remove this
16:22 - all right so const const git count
16:27 - get count is equal to turn turn turn
16:30 - turn
16:32 - now now let's go and initialize the
16:35 - count
16:36 - to zero right now in here we need to go
16:39 - ahead and
16:40 - loop through all
16:44 - card items but here's the question
16:48 - where are these card items where do they
16:49 - go like
16:51 - how do we get them right that's a good
16:53 - question the way we get them is
16:54 - we need to pass them as what guys we
16:56 - need to pass in the car items is what
17:00 - as props because look at this let's go
17:02 - to app.js boom voila
17:05 - look at this we have what oh i don't
17:07 - know what happened here at the gs
17:09 - the card items are where here correct
17:13 - so last test let's pass them in not just
17:15 - into the
17:16 - cart i card but also into what
17:20 - the header so we're going to say card
17:23 - items
17:25 - is equal to what card
17:28 - items good good good and then what we do
17:32 - is we go to the header
17:33 - and here we're going to pass in the
17:34 - props so again we'll go
17:36 - we'll it's called this is called uh
17:37 - what's it called what is this called
17:38 - what did i say the last time
17:40 - uh the structuring structuring thank you
17:42 - i forgot what i thought
17:44 - car items right i know so we're going to
17:47 - destructure props to have the card items
17:48 - understood
17:49 - good good good good good and what are we
17:51 - going to do at this point well
17:53 - we're going to loop through every card
17:54 - item so look through all card items and
17:56 - to do that
17:58 - what we will do is very simple we'll say
18:00 - card items
18:02 - dot four each check this out for each
18:05 - and so what's going to happen is for
18:07 - each card item
18:09 - for each card item we're going to the
18:12 - following
18:12 - task think about this guys okay we're
18:15 - going to go ahead and do
18:17 - count right what what add
18:20 - what do we say add the quantity what
18:25 - at the quantity of the card item
18:29 - to what to total
18:32 - correct yes or no yes or no guys
18:36 - yes yes of course right so what are we
18:38 - going to do so the count
18:40 - plus equal to what
18:44 - item card item i will say item
18:48 - that what
18:52 - the what quantity
18:56 - and that quantity or how does well
18:58 - depends okay so i'm about quantity so
18:59 - again
19:00 - but that depends again it depends on
19:02 - okay so i got quantity okay let's see
19:03 - that under quantity beautiful
19:05 - so now all we got to do is think about
19:07 - this to call this
19:09 - function here's the cool thing
19:12 - if we get the count we loop through all
19:14 - we can do is return the number now
19:15 - return
19:17 - count boom right we return that count
19:21 - guys
19:22 - we are 155 likes that's cool guys you
19:24 - guys are the best let's get to 200 guys
19:26 - all right so we're going to return the
19:27 - count and what's going to happen now at
19:29 - this point
19:30 - we will go ahead and say what get count
19:32 - in here
19:34 - we'll say like this right there get
19:37 - count this
19:38 - will call the function and actually
19:39 - return the data think about this guys
19:41 - look at this
19:41 - it will call the function and and
19:46 - return the data and return your data
19:49 - exactly something do we need to use use
19:51 - date that's a good question
19:52 - we don't need to use use tape because
19:54 - here's why here's why here's why
19:57 - you'll see here's the thing card items
20:01 - is already is a state right card items
20:03 - is going to change automatically correct
20:05 - right
20:06 - so as car items changes this function is
20:09 - going to re-ran
20:10 - every single time the card items change
20:12 - and the get count function is going to
20:14 - be
20:14 - rerun every single time this portion
20:18 - changes because the car items is
20:21 - a state understood so that's why so
20:24 - sometimes you have to watch like do you
20:26 - need to use state or not so in this case
20:27 - we don't really need to use state now
20:29 - now let's go and save this and look at
20:31 - that
20:32 - what do we have we get an nan
20:36 - [Laughter]
20:46 - right what do you think it stands for
20:48 - guys
20:49 - what do you think it stands for tell me
20:51 - well it's very simple
20:53 - what it stands for is that we screwed up
20:56 - that's what it stands for we screwed the
20:58 - heck up now let's think about
21:00 - how do we go ahead and fix this right
21:02 - that's the question when you want to ask
21:03 - for something right
21:04 - very simple well let's think about this
21:06 - all right
21:07 - if you think about this one of the ways
21:09 - we can take a look at it is let's go
21:10 - ahead and console
21:11 - the actual current item so consult the
21:12 - log
21:14 - car items beautiful
21:18 - items okay okay
21:22 - let's go inspect down but on this one
21:23 - let's go to console
21:25 - because you know how much we love the
21:26 - console good
21:29 - let's go to console right here awesome
21:32 - let me see let me go and refresh the
21:35 - page here
21:38 - let's see it has nothing and now we have
21:40 - these two but then it says receive
21:42 - nan for the children attribute oh that's
21:45 - interesting
21:47 - why why why why
21:51 - you're covering the whole uh console by
21:53 - the way i know that's it
21:54 - there you go thank you so look at this
21:58 - same thing you represent a value
22:00 - something is not right guys you see so i
22:03 - actually think it's because of the kind
22:04 - because
22:04 - here's the thing guys if you go to cart
22:06 - items let's think about this
22:08 - wait uh isn't for each
22:12 - uh a thing a loop that doesn't return
22:15 - anything
22:16 - so basically we lose count in there
22:20 - we don't need to return anything we
22:21 - don't need to return anything because we
22:23 - only need to
22:24 - loop through we're not trying to return
22:25 - anything here but here's what guys look
22:27 - at this guys i want you to pay attention
22:29 - here real quickly guys you see this
22:30 - product right here
22:31 - this product well what do you think look

22:35 - item.quantity but the item is this whole
22:38 - thing right here and the item has id

24:41 - yeah there we go good good my bad guys
24:43 - my bad
24:44 - mo all good we've saved we said we've
24:47 - saved the world here that's okay
24:49 - all right so it's going back to the card
24:51 - and so now that was our first part
24:54 - now what i want to focus on is let's go
24:56 - ahead and create the second part which
24:57 - is
24:58 - the card this proceed to checkout
25:00 - portion right here you see this producer
25:01 - check oh
25:01 - i want to start off i want us to focus
25:03 - on this portion now so this portion has
25:05 - a few things which just has a subtotal
25:07 - and then it has the total price so let's
25:09 - go to cart total and actually
25:10 - work on that that should be pretty
25:12 - pretty pretty cool all right let's think
25:14 - about this what do we do
25:15 - and so forth all right subtotal go react
25:18 - up all right
25:19 - to do that what are we gonna do guys
25:21 - very simple let's go to cart total
25:24 - card total and you notice how cool it is
25:27 - that
25:28 - and you can see for example uh well we
25:30 - have the container
25:31 - and we already have the subtotal his
25:34 - david's typing is already we have that
25:36 - there in there which is really cool let
25:39 - me see
25:41 - now one really cool thing that you
25:42 - notice right you see how
25:44 - we are working in little small
25:45 - components right we're going from one
25:48 - thing
25:48 - to another thing right from one thing to
25:50 - the second thing and so
25:51 - this allows us to really really focus on
25:54 - specific components and just build them
25:56 - one by one
25:57 - so trying to build this whole humongous
25:59 - thing
26:00 - that is the beauty of components and
26:02 - react.js
26:04 - okay so i want you to keep that in mind
26:07 - all right awesome let's go and continue
26:09 - on so what's next david
26:11 - what's next is actually we should be
26:13 - going into cars
26:15 - just smash that like button is what
26:16 - that's what's next oh yes
26:18 - oh i'm sorry yeah you should smash that
26:20 - like button
26:22 - like let's stop for a second and
26:24 - everybody
26:25 - make sure that like button down there is
26:28 - blue
26:29 - and it's smashed okay yes of course of
26:32 - course of course
26:33 - awesome so let's go and continue on all
26:35 - right uh next
26:36 - up is what are you gonna do we gotta go
26:39 - to car.js because obviously we need to
26:42 - pass in the card items
26:43 - into uh card total uh why why
26:47 - because we are we need to calculate the
26:50 - the amount that we are going
26:52 - to okay but not yet because i'm going to
26:54 - put in a fake amount first so far
26:56 - i'm gonna say let's say i'm gonna say
26:57 - two items and i'm gonna say
26:59 - and then after that what's gonna happen
27:01 - so let's say it's just two items
27:03 - and then we're going to in that we're
27:05 - going to actually put
27:06 - the what the the price
27:10 - correct okay good the price so you come
27:13 - with that
27:14 - beautiful that's going to be the price
27:15 - that looks awesome
27:17 - that looks really cool and then we're
27:19 - going to have a button
27:20 - a button a button that's going to be
27:23 - proceeded to choke out
27:24 - right so let's create a bouton so check
27:27 - out bouton
27:28 - good good good good so again he's going
27:30 - to use style components for this guys
27:32 - right so check out bhutan
27:33 - so const right there check out bouton
27:37 - is equal to style the div do you
27:40 - know oh start a button you see he's
27:42 - smart
27:43 - he's learning also i made the mistake
27:47 - and i used h2 here so i'm just gonna say
27:50 - uh subtotal that's fine good subtotal so
27:54 - the reason why he did this because he
27:55 - realized that we needed to add what
27:58 - we need to add some style into it and so
28:00 - with that he said subtotal which will
28:02 - allow us to just do style.h2 and
28:04 - actually give it a style at the same
28:05 - time so
28:06 - let's give a style to the bhutan right
28:08 - so let's think about the bhutan
28:09 - right the baton has what well i like you
28:13 - like my bhutan
28:14 - thing oh yeah i do
28:17 - so the first thing is first is the
28:18 - bouton has the
28:20 - the keyword what should it proceed to
28:22 - check out what what should you say
28:24 - proceed to checkout so proceed
28:27 - let me see proceed to
28:31 - to what to check out like this
28:34 - is that correct yes yes good pursue the
28:37 - check i think oh
28:38 - god so check out i like that okay i like
28:41 - that person check oh that's awesome
28:42 - and then what's going to happen is very
28:44 - simple is let's go ahead and add a
28:46 - background color so we'll do
28:48 - background background actually it's
28:50 - going to say this so we have we see what
28:51 - we got
28:52 - oh check out but it's not defined how
28:57 - uh i think i made a typo i think you did
29:01 - checo buton wait
29:06 - wait ah okay how do you spell checkout
29:15 - let's go hey you go now you get the
29:18 - patone right there okay
29:19 - you like my button you know name so
29:22 - background color
29:25 - background color we're going to give it
29:26 - a color of i have a copy for you okay
29:28 - fine you can just copy that's fine
29:30 - boom there we go awesome so save this
29:33 - and boom now it's an orange okay
29:35 - next thing what i want to do is i can
29:36 - make this this bit of a bigger
29:38 - a bit of a bigger what's it called a bit
29:40 - of a bigger um
29:42 - button but given a width of 100 so what
29:44 - this will do guys is they will stretch
29:46 - out this whole div
29:47 - by 100 so let's go ahead and do that
29:49 - right now
29:51 - yeah exactly all right right now so good
29:55 - good good so did you do it
29:57 - yeah i did let me see did you save it
29:59 - let me see save it
30:01 - let me see ah now it's there now it's
30:04 - there
30:04 - also i'm going to make it bigger hold up
30:06 - man you're tapping way too fast hold on
30:08 - hold on ah
30:09 - come on oh no i want to make it a little
30:10 - bit bigger so i'm going to say padding
30:13 - padding guys padding 4 pixels 4 pixels
30:16 - and and an 8 pixels so what this means
30:20 - guys just so you know
30:21 - no this is not trouble actually this is
30:22 - actually or this is actually vertical
30:25 - and horizontal right so this is going to
30:27 - apply so if
30:28 - you can see here it's going to apply
30:30 - four pixels to both
30:32 - the vertical axis which is the top and
30:34 - bottom
30:35 - and horizontal is going to be eight
30:36 - pixels that's going to be left and right
30:38 - that's another shortcut you guys can
30:39 - learn as well okay
30:41 - so boom right there so you can see this
30:42 - makes the button a little bit bigger
30:43 - right there you see that okay right
30:45 - there guys beautiful this makes it a
30:46 - little bit bigger awesome
30:47 - next up let's go ahead and do this let's

31:23 - to give it oh
31:24 - look at how good this looks now look at
31:26 - this procedure checkout looks so much
31:28 - better now
31:29 - what's up magnificent
31:32 - he added a border radius guys the reason
31:34 - why is to add a little bit of this
31:35 - concave shape right here correct
31:37 - and that's pretty much it now of course
31:39 - you see it doesn't doesn't feel like a
31:40 - button because it doesn't have this hand
31:42 - thing right on it so
31:43 - what we are going to do is we are going
31:45 - to do a cursor pointer
31:46 - to add no not type yeah there you go
31:48 - good cursor pointer
31:50 - that's going to give it that specific
31:52 - kind of like uh you know
31:54 - button automate automatic on a button
31:57 - i know the ui is the case that's
31:59 - interesting okay and now it's going to

37:00 - boom boom
37:01 - awesome we got that's all good now the
37:05 - items look at this we have the price and
37:07 - we have the items in here is that
37:08 - correct yes or no
37:10 - yes correct now the question now becomes
37:14 - is very simple for you
37:16 - and for me guys okay
37:19 - how do we get the total here
37:23 - what do we do like i said
37:26 - we need to pass it in that's it what do
37:29 - we do
37:29 - well but just like we said before right
37:32 - here are some of the steps that we
37:34 - should be
37:34 - thinking about doing right again what
37:36 - are we going to do right
37:38 - loop through loop through all the car
37:42 - items
37:43 - correct then what for each item
37:50 - item what right
37:54 - add what at the price what example how
37:57 - do we get the total price okay
37:59 - we add the price of the item
38:05 - item multiplied by
38:11 - by the quantity right
38:14 - because think about this think about
38:15 - this right if there are right now
38:17 - if there are two macbook pros and they
38:21 - both cost let's say
38:22 - a thousand dollars then the total price
38:24 - is how much guys the total price is what
38:25 - two thousand not one thousand but the
38:27 - total price of the whole card is two
38:30 - thousand because two macbook pros
38:32 - each one costs a thousand dollars right
38:33 - so we have to not only include the price
38:36 - which is right here
38:37 - the price but also multiply the price by
38:40 - the quantity
38:41 - that's in the cart understood because
38:43 - somebody said
38:44 - for each item take quantity multiple
38:46 - prices exactly
38:47 - stefan beautiful job that's exactly and
38:50 - then what we do is what
38:51 - save what save the what
38:55 - save what save the total
39:00 - save the total save the save the price
39:04 - in the total or add the price of total
39:06 - at the price of total
39:08 - add to the total exactly
39:12 - right actually we just received a
39:14 - suggestion from david
39:16 - he goes like if we put the uh card item
39:19 - loop
39:19 - from the header and move it to a
39:21 - standalone function file
39:23 - and reuse it that way we can reduce
39:28 - i like that that's actually pretty smart
39:29 - david that's actually pretty smart we
39:30 - can do that
39:31 - for the get total price yes you we can
39:34 - do that for the get total count we can
39:36 - reuse that one
39:37 - right we can use that one i think so
39:39 - right now we can reuse that
39:40 - that that functionality right but they
39:42 - get total price that will be fully used
39:44 - in the
39:45 - actual procedure checkout and that kind
39:46 - of stuff right so but yeah that's
39:48 - awesome i like it i like it i like it so
39:50 - in here i kind of just want to add it to
39:52 - here for a second right now right so
39:53 - what i want to do because i'm focusing
39:55 - only on
39:56 - i'm focusing only on the what the
39:59 - well let me see you can there we go i'm
40:02 - focusing only on the
40:03 - the price right now so i'm gonna say
40:05 - const get total price
40:08 - is equal to what boom
40:12 - it's a function now correct so let's
40:13 - think about this right this is what we
40:15 - need to do right so for loop through
40:16 - each car item so
40:17 - the first things first need to do is we
40:18 - need to actually pass the car items into
40:20 - here is that correct yes or no
40:23 - of course uh jason jsx
40:27 - what's going on here no no it was just
40:30 - uh there was another closing thing
40:33 - and it's so good i just fixed this yeah
40:37 - cool cool so look at this now so we got
40:39 - that get oil price now it's passing the
40:41 - car items into where the cart as well
40:43 - correct so let's do
40:44 - app.js let's pass in well we do pass in
40:48 - wait it's in the closet in
40:55 - so he actually means let's move it to
40:57 - the cart to
40:59 - the functionality of the card section um
41:03 - i kind of like that actually
41:06 - maybe that's better even so we don't
41:07 - have to pass it in every single time
41:09 - hold on hold the phone hold the phone
41:12 - let's do that here's we'll do this get
41:15 - to a price instead of having a bean in
41:17 - here guys i'll teach you this
41:18 - really something really quick here okay
41:20 - instead of having it being inside the
41:21 - car total here's what we'll do we'll go
41:23 - the cart and we'll
41:24 - we'll find it we'll we'll create it here
41:27 - boom right there
41:28 - so we have to pass in the get the car
41:30 - items everywhere all this thing every
41:31 - single time okay
41:33 - so now let's think about this get total
41:35 - price that's good good good good
41:37 - and now let's go ahead and actually
41:39 - calculate the total which is really
41:40 - simple right we need to loop through
41:42 - what
41:42 - loop through let's go and initialize the
41:43 - total so let total is equal to zero
41:46 - good and what now what now
41:50 - what are we doing to do card items
41:52 - correct
41:54 - why what yeah right what yeah yeah card
41:57 - items okay
41:58 - let me see where's ecam hold on ah
42:01 - that's not what i want
42:04 - there we go think about that okay there
42:06 - we go we're going to do
42:07 - card items for each
42:11 - boom boom boom
42:14 - so for each item right just how we've
42:18 - done it before we're going to do
42:19 - we will go ahead and do total plus
42:23 - equal to what
42:26 - plus equal to what
42:30 - item the product
42:35 - the price times what
42:41 - times the item the product.quantity
42:45 - item the product that quantity
42:52 - boom right there right there that's
42:55 - going to be
42:56 - your your total guys
42:59 - total plus equal to somebody said why
43:02 - not use reduced
43:03 - why not use reduced because people do
43:04 - not know reduce just yet so i don't want
43:06 - to confuse you guys too much with reduce
43:08 - you want to start from the from basics
43:10 - and then you can use reduce after that
43:11 - guys okay
43:12 - so total plus equal to item the product
43:15 - price
43:15 - times item the product that quantity
43:18 - right so
43:19 - that is awesome and all we do is return
43:22 - total boom right there
43:25 - return total save that and now to do
43:28 - this all we got to do is very simple
43:30 - guys let's think about this
43:31 - right let's think about this let's go
43:33 - and pass in the get total price
43:35 - in here so we'll do git total price
43:40 - price right there is equal to what
43:43 - ins simple get total price
43:46 - see right in the cart total
43:50 - we we're going to pass it as a props and
43:52 - then we're going to use it now so so get
43:55 - total price
43:58 - right there okay and now all we got to
44:01 - do at this point is just get it to a
44:03 - price look at this now here
44:05 - call that function do get total price
44:11 - but i gotta call it an actual function
44:13 - right there like this
44:14 - boom oh would you look at this
44:18 - guys whoa look at this
44:22 - right some we just iterate through all
44:26 - the
44:26 - prices in the object and find the total
44:29 - exactly guys look at this
44:30 - this by the way yes this is called the
44:31 - structuring of course we passed in the
44:34 - ghetto price from where from the cart
44:36 - in here we pass in the function itself
44:38 - from the card total in here
44:40 - pass it into what the cart total
44:43 - right and then all we need to simply use
44:45 - that function that's honestly guys
44:47 - that is it that is all you need to do
44:50 - okay that's all you need to do guys
44:51 - beautiful so we saved that portion
44:55 - so see that person that's all good all
44:56 - right now let's think about this now so
44:59 - we got the total price
45:00 - now let's think about let's go back to
45:02 - cart let's think about
45:04 - the ghetto count right well that's
45:06 - inside the cart item so if we go to cart
45:08 - items here
45:09 - where's actually now where's where's the
45:11 - gittle account it's in the header it's
45:12 - in the header that's what uh
45:14 - that's what david said we might be able
45:16 - to put uh
45:17 - grab it and export it as a as an
45:20 - external
45:21 - um like it's a like a component ah
45:24 - that's okay and
45:25 - actually no you you don't wanna know
45:28 - components components it can be a
45:31 - component um components you
45:33 - you don't want to make functionality
45:35 - components guys components are only for
45:36 - ui ux elements okay just so you guys
45:38 - know very very important okay
45:39 - for components it's only about dividing
45:42 - up every ui ux element
45:44 - functionality wise that's how we use
45:46 - components okay
45:48 - you can use things like redux for that
45:50 - and so forth okay but
45:51 - inside there you should not use that
45:53 - okay
45:54 - beautiful so github price we pass it
45:57 - into here that is amazing now
45:58 - last thing we're going to do is we're
46:00 - going to also create a get uh what
46:02 - get total count right so let's do git
46:05 - you can actually
46:06 - that's going to copy from the header so
46:07 - head to the gs i know technically it's
46:09 - copying uh technically it's you know not
46:11 - the best way of doing this but it's okay
46:13 - so we'll do go to here go to cart we'll
46:15 - copy the get count
46:18 - boom boom get count right there boom
46:21 - boom right there
46:22 - right there so we also now have the cut
46:24 - the count functionality as well
46:26 - since we'll do a card total plus what
46:29 - get count get count right here is equal
46:33 - to what guys
46:35 - is equal to get count
46:39 - boom right there so get count is equal
46:41 - to get count
46:42 - that's pretty pretty pretty much it
46:44 - honestly so cool we got that portion car
46:47 - items get count that's all good
46:48 - comprende all is bueno correct yes or no
46:52 - yes let's now go to the card total
46:55 - good inside the cartridge will also pass
46:57 - in the the
46:59 - get count functionality
47:02 - the account good and inside here guys
47:05 - what do you guys think we knew tell me
47:06 - tell me in the description what do you
47:07 - do guys what do you guys tell me
47:10 - well we just do get count in here
47:15 - that's it yeah count and boom look at
47:18 - that
47:18 - we got 40 items boom
47:21 - guys look at this we got 40 items we got
47:25 - 5 1737 1 5 100
47:29 - 51 735 that we're gonna spend
47:32 - on 25 macbook pros and 15 ipads
47:37 - who want 25 apple bros guys huh tell me
47:40 - i like that
47:41 - i like that you can ship it to me you
47:43 - know my address
47:44 - yeah yeah exactly exactly so you can see
47:47 - i know right
47:48 - so now we got this we got this but there
47:50 - is an issue here there is one
47:52 - issue guys here there's one issue here
47:54 - okay let me let me load this down okay
47:57 - the one issue here
48:00 - uh two
48:04 - so guys one issue here is very simple
48:07 - okay anybody sees an issue here guys
48:10 - you see how this number is not formatted
48:11 - it doesn't seem like it's a real number
48:13 - that's actually a form of that number
48:15 - how do we format that number bro
48:18 - oh dang that's where you come in yeah
48:21 - that's where i come in
48:24 - so look that's some ninjas so to form
48:26 - this number we can actually
48:28 - use a react library guys or a library so
48:31 - for example
48:31 - if you type in for example react number
48:33 - format
48:35 - all right think about this are you
48:37 - kidding me you're just gonna do an np
48:38 - i'm installing
48:39 - get it done that way of course why not
48:41 - that's that's all the solution for
48:42 - everything
48:43 - so react component you see everything
48:45 - guys you can find with react
48:47 - any any solution that you want anything
48:49 - you want to find out
48:50 - for example let's say you want to build
48:51 - a slider or let's say you want to build
48:53 - anything else you know in react there's
48:56 - a component for it
48:57 - there's something that's going to help
48:58 - you do it all you got to do is search up
49:00 - on google that's pretty much
49:01 - it guys so i will do react number format
49:04 - in here
49:04 - okay and this one for example says react
49:06 - component to form a number in an
49:08 - input as a text boom right there look at
49:10 - this guys this will give an example
49:12 - here's an example you see i can format
49:14 - it as a value
49:17 - that's pretty much it look at this this
49:18 - is literally all i need look
49:20 - i'll put look dollar sign like
49:26 - you know what i mean you got the answer
49:28 - right there you got this somebody said
49:30 - just
49:31 - somebody said that just use display flex
49:32 - that's funny
49:34 - so so here's what we'll do we've been
49:37 - saying
49:37 - all the time i know i know i know so
49:39 - here's what we'll do we'll do npm
49:41 - install
49:41 - react number format right there so npm
49:43 - install react number format so
49:45 - here's what we'll do let's go and go to
49:46 - here let's open this up
49:48 - inside integrated terminal boom npm
49:51 - install
49:52 - react number format so install that
49:54 - right there guys
49:56 - google is the master everybody says yes
49:58 - it is always
49:59 - and now all we got to do is use it okay
50:01 - now the question is how do we use it
50:03 - pretty simple right let's go and figure
50:04 - out how do we use it well you need to
50:06 - import it first so it's going to import
50:08 - it
50:08 - using this using import number format
50:12 - in here so as we'll do we'll import it
50:15 - in here
50:16 - oh another format and now we just need
50:18 - to use that number that's pretty much it
50:19 - so
50:20 - so look number format
50:23 - let me see let me see where's how do we
50:25 - do it look see we pass in the value
50:27 - which is a number
50:28 - we can say what text separator and so
50:31 - and the prefix if you wanted to
50:32 - it's as simple as that and exactly what
50:34 - we're going to do actually check this
50:35 - out guys
50:36 - yep display text thoughts are pretty
50:38 - good so look
50:41 - right as we'll do we'll do
50:44 - number format we'll copy this actually
50:46 - fully
50:48 - boom copy this boom i'm showing you guys
50:50 - how a developer
50:52 - does this honestly there's nothing crazy
50:53 - to this guys i'm just gonna i just want
50:55 - to let you know
50:55 - there's literally nothing crazy to
50:57 - something like this just so you know
50:58 - okay guys
51:00 - let me see go to here good let's go
51:03 - ahead and
51:03 - uh what just happened actually i don't
51:05 - need this at all
51:07 - good boom you see now there's number
51:09 - formats now
51:10 - this is what we were get ah where'd it
51:14 - go
51:16 - yo what's happening man oh no just
51:18 - happened
51:21 - all bad guys it's okay i got under
51:24 - control
51:27 - do you i think it's because i click hide
51:29 - that's why
51:30 - oh yeah so it's a good door
51:34 - this has happened to us multiple times
51:35 - so now to us it's like okay that's fine
51:37 - so so let's go do this right so we have
51:40 - look at this number format
51:41 - value is this display text is this okay
51:43 - then we have thousands separate that's
51:45 - true prefix is dollar sign so here's
51:46 - what we'll do
51:47 - all i gotta do now is just change this
51:48 - right here and we'll see what
51:51 - get total price
51:56 - call the function
52:00 - let's see it now oh
52:04 - would you look at this
52:07 - guys oh crisp whoo
52:11 - look at this guys 51 735 you can see
52:14 - that this becomes like a very readable
52:16 - number right instead of having a number
52:18 - that's like
52:18 - you know 51 and not without a comma
52:21 - right this is an
52:21 - actual clean number which is amazing
52:24 - amazing right
52:26 - that's pretty much it guys look at this
52:28 - and this you see
52:29 - you see how fast we did this guys so
52:31 - fast super duper fast
52:34 - super super super duper fast okay good
52:37 - so now
52:38 - we got that portion okay next up what i
52:40 - want to do is very simple guys look at
52:42 - this
52:42 - so we have this is working the at the
52:44 - card is working the card is working
52:46 - itself
52:47 - that is amazing the next thing i want to
52:48 - change is to be able to
52:50 - do the quantity portion i think that's
52:52 - the next thing that we should be
52:53 - focusing on
52:55 - uh up next pretty much let me go and
52:57 - take a look at this
52:59 - yes how do we go ahead and actually
53:01 - change
53:02 - the item quantity guys that is the
53:04 - question
53:05 - right how do we change the item quantity
53:07 - what do you think david
53:09 - so i think we should be doing something
53:12 - in the card items.js file
53:15 - where we have uh where we have all the
53:19 - uh select thingies okay so let's go do
53:22 - that
53:24 - and what i'm thinking of doing
53:27 - is actually no it's actually in the card
53:29 - item instead of card items
53:32 - because that's right item are you sure
53:35 - yes i am okay we have the select right
53:38 - right right because again this portion
53:41 - right
53:42 - works on the actual individual item so
53:44 - we should have a function that that
53:46 - basically
53:47 - allows us to change the quantity inside
53:49 - individual car item understood
53:52 - exactly and what i would do is um
53:56 - going into the select uh
54:00 - over here and then hit add and then just
54:03 - fire off an unchanged right
54:05 - yeah so what does that mean tell me so
54:07 - that means
54:08 - is whenever i go ahead click that
54:11 - quantity button
54:12 - and select something else than the
54:14 - active value
54:16 - of the select correct it's going to fire
54:18 - this function off right correct let's do
54:20 - that so let's go
54:21 - go ahead and do something about it all
54:23 - right so what i'm
54:24 - what i'm gonna do here is actually
54:27 - before
54:27 - before i get that started i want to
54:29 - create a brand new function
54:31 - uh we're going to get it done in just a
54:33 - minute but
54:34 - what i want to uh have is a new function
54:37 - that will change
54:38 - the value in firebase so it will be
54:41 - co i'm going to call it change uh
54:43 - quantity
54:44 - so change quantity good
54:47 - and it's just going to be a simple
54:50 - function
54:51 - i'm just going to leave it empty for now
54:53 - and
54:54 - what i'm going to do is unchange going
54:57 - back to the select
54:58 - so on change um
55:02 - there is obviously a an event that is
55:05 - actually fired
55:06 - with the um with the function correct
55:09 - okay awesome yes and that will have a
55:12 - value
55:12 - now i want to make sure that that value
55:15 - is going to be passed in
55:17 - the change quantity uh function right
55:20 - good yes so what
55:21 - i do here is i'm gonna say change
55:24 - quantity and
55:26 - [Music]
55:28 - event dot target dot value
55:32 - so what does this mean guys just so you
55:33 - do as you guys know okay
55:35 - event the target value look at this so
55:37 - what this means
55:38 - select so this select option right here
55:40 - right this side option right here
55:42 - what happens here is that when you click
55:44 - on change it
55:45 - receives an event in the event here this
55:48 - event is actually that you click
55:49 - from 2025 to quantity 12.
55:53 - exactly now it has a value the value
55:56 - is going to be the 12. right so right
55:58 - this event has a it changed
56:00 - because for example here's what here's
56:01 - what we can do if i can pass it think
56:02 - about this guys i can do pass and change
56:04 - quantity e
56:04 - okay let's just i want to show to you
56:06 - guys and then i can do console log for
56:08 - example if i do console log on here
56:10 - oh yeah i saw the log let's just say e
56:13 - okay
56:14 - now you guys can see exactly what we're
56:15 - talking about right there's nothing
56:16 - nothing to hide right
56:17 - oh yeah e right so that's the event
56:21 - and then let's say for example i go to
56:23 - the inspector on here and then i go to
56:25 - my console okay can you hide us
56:28 - just so we can see the terminal good
56:31 - good good so here for example let's say
56:32 - i click on this
56:34 - look see that's an event that gets fired
56:37 - up automatically by
56:38 - javascript itself and look at this this
56:40 - event has a lot of stuff right
56:42 - a lot a lot of stuff one thing has look
56:45 - the target
56:46 - oh the target you see that and this
56:50 - target has look at this
56:51 - target go down go down good stop too
56:55 - there's a lot of stuff like html and
56:56 - html software node
56:58 - right keep going keep going op
57:01 - rst there's more stuff holy shiz nick
57:06 - st value
57:09 - boom boom right there you see that guys
57:13 - that is the value that we clicked on
57:16 - okay value e dot target dot value
57:20 - so if i want to go ahead and get that
57:22 - value i do either target
57:24 - that value and now for example when i go
57:28 - ahead and go to here console log the
57:30 - the the new quantity i can call it
57:32 - whatever what should we call a new
57:34 - quantity
57:35 - that's fine yeah i'll call it new
57:37 - quantity
57:38 - something's like holy shiznick
57:40 - [Laughter]
57:42 - good so consola log new quantity
57:46 - ah oh
57:50 - what you know what see ya what
57:54 - cg boom there you have it oh my god okay
57:58 - fine
58:01 - he's trying to be fancy out here you
58:03 - guys i mean
58:04 - snippets bro speed okay cool so inspect
58:07 - them on this again guys let's see
58:09 - okay console console
58:12 - right if i go ahead and i'll clear this
58:14 - out if i click on this
58:17 - boom 17. see i click on 17. 10.
58:20 - boom oh oh oh
58:23 - let's go that is what i'm talking about
58:26 - you guys see
58:26 - this is how you do it little by little
58:29 - by little and you get yourself the
58:30 - answer
58:30 - right there's always an answer to
58:32 - everything all right beautiful so we got
58:34 - that portion
58:35 - this is exciting stuff huh what do you
58:36 - guys think oh yeah
58:38 - yes now
58:42 - so we got that portion guys now now
58:45 - let's actually now change the quantity
58:46 - now to change the quantity we need to
58:47 - actually go to the database now
58:49 - so do db.collection.com items right
58:51 - because of course we need to
58:52 - what we need to go to the right
58:55 - change the quantity the
58:59 - quantity in db right that's going to be
59:02 - our next portion okay
59:06 - oh good good nice good it's it it's
59:08 - called card items right
59:10 - just like that and so what he's doing
59:11 - here is he's getting the collection for
59:13 - the card items okay and then he's
59:14 - basically he's getting the individual
59:16 - card item by the id right
59:18 - because why we pass it into here you see
59:20 - that guys the id is in here
59:22 - okay and then all we do is we do the
59:24 - update
59:25 - the update and we give it the new
59:27 - quantity
59:28 - which is the new quantity right here and
59:30 - we do parse in because we want to make
59:33 - it not a string but an actual integer
59:35 - right not not a string but an actual
59:37 - integer number right because later on we
59:39 - need to be able to add them together
59:40 - right so that's how we do that parts and
59:42 - i think it's already an integer
59:44 - but it's just a good practice to just
59:46 - make sure every single time that you
59:48 - parse it to the correct format
59:50 - exactly next up you have is db is not
59:52 - defined no problem whatsoever
59:53 - so you need to import db so import right
59:56 - here
59:58 - db from what
60:04 - do you not see my type david
60:08 - firebase right there awesome so right
60:12 - there awesome so we got that portion
60:14 - and now guys when we go ahead and change
60:16 - the quantity in the cart items
60:18 - what do you think should have it's going
60:20 - to like chain through the whole
60:21 - application
60:22 - what do you think should happen are you
60:24 - guys ready for this are you ready for
60:26 - this yes or no
60:28 - are you ready let's go let's think about
60:30 - this let's try this out
60:31 - this is gonna be really cool so now okay
60:33 - let's think let's make sure this
60:34 - actually works
60:35 - if i go to now the quantity here let's
60:39 - change this to now
60:40 - one oh
60:45 - pay attention to it i would change it on
60:47 - the header
60:48 - look and then the subtotal as well look
60:50 - and leave the price got up guys
60:52 - guys look at this guys
60:55 - look at here look at here look at the
60:57 - price
60:58 - ready for this bro boom already
61:02 - boom boom
61:06 - boom
61:09 - same thing with this same thing with
61:11 - this whatever i want let's get let's get
61:13 - 19.
61:14 - let's get 19 of these ones 50 000
61:18 - let's go ahead and go boom shakalaka is
61:21 - how we do it guys how sick is that now
61:25 - how does this all work you might be
61:28 - asking yourself huh
61:30 - how does it work like how what is it
61:32 - what what
61:33 - magic black box is this and look
61:36 - there is an explanation for everything
61:38 - right the question is
61:41 - do you know it right so guys let's do it
61:44 - guys
61:45 - let's explain how this actually works i
61:47 - want to show i want to show you guys
61:48 - some magic okay
61:49 - i'll show you some magic here okay
61:51 - understood
61:57 - [Music]
62:04 - beautiful there we go now here check
62:08 - this out guys i want to show you
62:08 - something really cool really cool
62:10 - the reason why this all this stuff works
62:13 - is because of state
62:14 - and because of firebase it's very simple
62:17 - if we go for example guys i want to show
62:19 - you something
62:20 - if we go to the home page okay
62:23 - right we get product if we go to the
62:25 - cart page
62:27 - what do we have we get this if we go to
62:29 - the app.js page what do we have
62:31 - we have cart items so the whole magic is
62:35 - actually in
62:36 - partially in here and inside here and
62:39 - this is the reason all these numbers
62:43 - are changing just this right here
62:46 - okay so i want you to pay attention
62:48 - really quickly here guys
62:49 - just pay attention really really quickly
62:51 - here and
62:53 - and trust me and if you understand it
62:55 - now if you are like holy this is
62:57 - crazy
62:57 - i want you to smash the like button on
63:00 - this video
63:00 - and i wanted to share this with your
63:02 - facebook friends i'm not kidding with
63:03 - you right now
63:04 - right if you're like holy this is
63:06 - so good
63:07 - you will i want you to promise me you'll
63:09 - do it can you promise me you'll do that
63:11 - guys can you promise me
63:12 - can you promise me you'll do that i can
63:15 - promise you good so
63:16 - so here's what we'll do guys check this
63:18 - out this
63:20 - firebase on the snapshot of the card
63:22 - items you see that right there
63:24 - right right
63:28 - on the snapshot of the card items if i
63:30 - for example look at think of this this
63:32 - right here gets
63:33 - you the card item see that right there
63:34 - this gets the card items from the
63:36 - database right yes or no
63:37 - well this right here is actually a live
63:40 - connection
63:41 - right so if i wanna if i'm gonna draw
63:43 - this out for you the way it kind of
63:44 - works very simple
63:45 - here's the database right here okay uh
63:48 - database is right here right let me
63:51 - actually make this to the right-hand
63:52 - side so we have it here
63:54 - boom okay all right database is right
63:57 - here
63:57 - this is your app correct i'm going to
64:00 - say this is
64:01 - app this is db
64:05 - correct let's check this out
64:08 - what happens here is very simple
64:11 - oh what happens here is very simple
64:15 - this right here the unsnapshot
64:18 - creates a continuous connection between
64:20 - db and your app so i want to show you
64:22 - something
64:23 - it's a connection look like this app
64:25 - goes to db
64:26 - and now db has a connection to back the
64:29 - app
64:30 - it's called a webhook it's called a
64:32 - continuous hook
64:34 - right it's a hook basically right and so
64:37 - what's going on here
64:38 - is there and this right here is is live
64:40 - so this way is a live connection
64:43 - right so what happens here is very
64:46 - simple
64:47 - if there's a change
64:51 - if there's a change on change
64:55 - in the database make this smaller
64:59 - in a database what's going to happen is
65:02 - what
65:02 - it's going to tell back
65:06 - the app that something has changed in
65:08 - the database
65:10 - so look and when it has changed the
65:11 - database what that creates
65:13 - is that what that fires off
65:17 - to the south guys this fires off
65:21 - this again
65:24 - how insane is that
65:29 - i want you to think about that here for
65:30 - a second okay
65:33 - right how insane is that right
65:38 - right this fires off that and so you
65:40 - actually see i can actually put a
65:42 - console log in here and you can see
65:44 - that that's how it works and so what
65:47 - happens then is
65:48 - this guys updates what
65:51 - the state
65:54 - if the state updates right if the state
65:58 - updates then what happens guys right on
66:01 - the change of the state
66:02 - that causes a what a re-render
66:07 - off page of components
66:11 - components yeah re-render what i say
66:14 - when i say re-render guys
66:18 - just refreshing right it's hitting it's
66:20 - almost like hitting refresh
66:21 - on your browser basically but it's like
66:24 - you just hit refresh on on that
66:26 - particular component exactly on that
66:28 - particular component right
66:29 - right in the state updates it tells the
66:32 - children to up exactly so if the state
66:34 - updates then all these children for
66:35 - example that are using the states for
66:37 - example this is why we have
66:38 - things like what we have the header
66:40 - right here right the user that thing
66:41 - and then we have the card items right
66:43 - here right for example right
66:45 - right these things these numbers
66:48 - actually these numbers
66:50 - get refreshed again because these state
66:54 - card items was changed again
66:57 - db triggered this whole thing
67:01 - right db triggered this function again
67:05 - right and think about this what makes db
67:08 - trigger this well because what
67:09 - when we go to the card item we say hey
67:14 - update the quantity
67:18 - boom that means there's a change here
67:22 - that means we that means db
67:26 - saw the change in the quantity and that
67:29 - is when it fired off and told the app
67:32 - that something has changed
67:33 - live this is why firebase is something
67:36 - called
67:37 - a live database do we understand that
67:41 - yes or no
67:43 - how sick is that i want you to tell me
67:46 - guys
67:47 - how cool is that that is a pretty
67:50 - interesting explanation a very
67:51 - interesting way of the way things work
67:53 - right
67:54 - and as you get more deeper into react
67:57 - everything
67:58 - works like this yes
68:01 - everything works like this this is why
68:03 - things happen so fast
68:05 - now of course now i'll take you back to
68:07 - here
68:08 - not saying that this is going to go
68:10 - ahead and actually
68:12 - right it's not not saying this is going
68:13 - to go ahead and actually fully like
68:15 - update uh what's it called um what's it
68:17 - called it's not it's not doing a hard
68:19 - refresh
68:20 - but react is very smart exactly what it
68:22 - needs to refresh so iraq is very smart
68:24 - that's saying okay
68:25 - well i need to refresh this and i need
68:27 - to refresh this it's us
68:28 - it's usually called a virtual dom
68:32 - it's because something called a virtual
68:33 - dom
68:35 - yeah exactly and that's the superpower
68:37 - of react and and
68:39 - just firebase working together yeah it's
68:41 - like just making everything
68:44 - it's super efficient if you know how to
68:46 - use it right
68:47 - exactly it's just like everything is up
68:50 - guys
68:50 - we've got the quantity do we understand
68:52 - that yes or no so if you promise
68:54 - you're going to share this video on
68:54 - facebook
68:58 - big promise do right now
69:01 - do right now wait no
69:04 - i smash that like button of course so
69:07 - guys
69:08 - so that is amazing amazing what is this
69:11 - a nas
69:12 - should teach the intro intricacies of
69:15 - using sound effects
69:16 - while coding since he is so awesome at
69:19 - it thank you so much adriana
69:20 - adrian that's amazing wow
69:23 - so yeah that's really really really cool
69:25 - stuff okay so let's do this now guys so
69:27 - we've done some amazing stuff at this
69:28 - point okay now what i want to do is
69:30 - the next thing i want to focus on is the
69:31 - delete portion here right which is
69:33 - delete delete section okay
69:34 - same thing here guys let's go and delete
69:36 - and actually create a delete section so
69:39 - to make sure it deletes let's create a
69:41 - function called delete
69:42 - delete item right so or let's do const
69:45 - delete item delete item in here
69:50 - okay that's going to be a function
69:52 - inside here
69:53 - boom boom boom and delete and again what
69:56 - are we going to do we're going to what
69:59 - going to pass in what
70:03 - what uh we need to press in the item
70:07 - right wait why no well no no what do you
70:09 - think we need to pass in the lead item
70:10 - well pretty much no it's very simple
70:12 - guys
70:12 - on delete item we just need to call the
70:14 - function under the item look at this
70:15 - guys let me see let me do this
70:16 - so here delete stop it hold on let me
70:19 - see i'll stop
70:20 - watching you david so here let's do
70:24 - boom so delete item right there this is
70:26 - what we got right here i'm gonna make
70:28 - this a little bit cleaner so we all we
70:29 - all have this
70:30 - okay oh on the click of this button
70:34 - very simple guys unclick unclick what
70:39 - you just want to fire this up okay okay
70:42 - delete
70:44 - boom that's it yeah we're going to pass
70:47 - on the e because there's always an e
70:49 - value that gets passed in okay
70:51 - oh yeah actually you want to make sure
70:52 - that if you do this
70:54 - you want to do uh even prevent uh
70:58 - default because by default react
71:00 - sometimes wants to
71:02 - refresh the whole page and you can
71:03 - prevent it this way okay that's fine
71:05 - that's fine it's fine it's fine okay
71:06 - that's fine
71:07 - okay good so now let's do this so what
71:09 - he's going to do now david is he's going
71:11 - to go to the collection database right
71:12 - here just how
71:13 - we've done it here in the card items but
71:15 - instead of doing an update he's actually
71:17 - going to do a delete so here's what he's
71:18 - going to do
71:19 - he's going to do doc just how we did it
71:22 - here but do
71:22 - dot delete and honestly guys that is
71:25 - pretty much
71:26 - it that's all you guys need to do and
71:28 - that is it
71:29 - that's it yeah
71:32 - and so look now if i click on the delete
71:35 - right here
71:36 - it will delete the full item from the
71:38 - card items and of course as we know
71:40 - that triggers what that triggers a
71:42 - change in database
71:44 - the database triggers a change in the
71:45 - app and of course then what
71:47 - the whole app refreshes understood
71:51 - yes so let's think about this guys ready
71:53 - for this guys
71:56 - ready for this let's go wait for this
71:58 - let's go so here's what's going what's
71:59 - going to happen now at this point very
72:00 - very
72:01 - very very very very simple let's go and
72:04 - do this let's go refresh on here
72:06 - make sure it's all good all i gotta do
72:08 - now is release at this point if so again
72:10 - connie changes
72:11 - that works boom okay
72:15 - this works as well i click delete ready
72:18 - for this bro
72:19 - boom look at that not only is it removed
72:23 - from here
72:24 - it's changed here and changed here again
72:27 - the power of firebase
72:29 - and the power of you state
72:32 - sorry okay
72:35 - you see holy how crazy is that
72:39 - guacamole
72:43 - guys at this point there's one thing
72:47 - left to create
72:48 - i'm sure you know what it is i'm sure
72:51 - you know what it is guys you know what
72:52 - it is
72:53 - because i know and it is called a login
72:56 - we are now going to create the login
73:01 - [Music]
73:02 - functionality
73:07 - [Music]
73:11 - oh okay anyways you gotta have some fun
73:15 - with that
73:16 - there we go so now let's do this guys
73:19 - let's do this
73:20 - let's let's dim this down a little lower
73:22 - so the longest will be very interesting
73:24 - guys just so you know the login is going
73:25 - to be really really interesting you're
73:26 - ready for this bro
73:28 - i'm so ready i was ready before you
73:34 - okay so the login page now that's going
73:37 - to be the interesting
73:38 - portion okay um well
73:41 - let's now think about this the login
73:43 - page number one needs a logo
73:45 - functionality
73:45 - as well but it also needs a login button
73:48 - okay
73:49 - so number one we should be able to see
73:50 - the hello nozzar that's partial that's
73:52 - part
73:53 - one and then of course we should be able
73:54 - to log out no problem okay understood
73:56 - yes or no
73:58 - yes yes good so we're almost at 300
74:01 - likes away let's go let's get to 300
74:03 - likes let's
74:04 - go
74:07 - david says keeping it in no open
74:09 - connection to the base
74:10 - is that risky no it's not that's
74:12 - actually something that every single
74:14 - website does
74:15 - um this is not connection it's a secure
74:18 - connection
74:19 - right so uh every single for example
74:22 - you're you know i mean think about this
74:24 - your messenger makes the connect has the
74:26 - connection
74:26 - like the your messenger app guys has the
74:29 - connection
74:30 - literally right 301 likes that's what
74:32 - i'm talking about beautiful
74:34 - and i think it actually um closes the
74:37 - connection
74:38 - when the application is like yeah yeah
74:41 - the application is off i close the
74:42 - connection but anyways
74:43 - so now what i wanted you guys to do
74:45 - let's go ahead and do this
74:46 - the first things first that we're going
74:48 - to do we've got everything working now

74:52 - right ready for this bro
74:55 - i'm ready let's quit the looking page
74:57 - that's gonna be sick
74:58 - so we'll do source new file we'll do

75:23 - simple guys
75:24 - so the login page now for the login page
75:26 - to fully work it should be
75:27 - a few different things that we need to
75:29 - make sure that it actually like
75:30 - fully fully fully works okay here's
75:33 - gonna happen
75:34 - so he's going to create he's going to
75:35 - import style components as he did here
75:38 - then he's going to go ahead and do the
75:39 - following right he's going to the
75:41 - container into login here
75:43 - and then he's going to continue
75:44 - constantly style that div inside here
75:46 - understood yes or no
75:47 - pretty simple all right good yes all
75:50 - right so we got that portion
75:51 - then what's going to happen is well if
75:53 - you think before we do that
75:55 - before we do that before we do that
75:56 - though okay let's do this
75:58 - login hold on
76:02 - oh come on i know i know i know you want
76:04 - to rush i know i know
76:05 - i know i know i know i know i know so
76:08 - don't let
76:08 - height i know i know i know so let's go
76:11 - to app.js guys and what i want to do
76:13 - with you right now is very simple
76:15 - is i want us all together to for the
76:18 - router is actually create another route
76:20 - called the login route
76:21 - for now let's just do this for now route
76:25 - route and we'll say what path is equal
76:28 - to what
76:30 - logging to login good
76:36 - oh okay i know you try i know i know bro
76:40 - and then we're going to create the login
76:42 - functionality inside here
76:44 - well well right there that's going gonna
76:47 - be the login component now the log
76:48 - component
76:49 - needs to be imported so we're gonna do
76:51 - import login
76:53 - from login okay login liquid is like
76:56 - you don't let me type that's like that's
76:59 - like david
77:00 - yeah it doesn't let me type
77:02 - [Laughter]
77:04 - that's funny so look let's now go to
77:07 - login
77:09 - login boom now there is a login right
77:11 - there beautiful right there see
77:14 - but of course there's an issue here is
77:15 - that we still have this amazon thing
77:17 - that should not be there
77:19 - don't worry about that just yet that's
77:20 - not too big of an issue that we need to
77:22 - worry about okay guys just so you know
77:24 - all right
77:24 - comprende comprending good
77:28 - so now
77:31 - login page let's actually design it now
77:34 - now the login page hit the login page
77:36 - now it's gonna it technically
77:39 - in the end it will not have this header
77:40 - in the end it will not don't worry we'll
77:42 - fix that
77:43 - in a second here but for this let's do
77:45 - the following
77:46 - login page will have a few things let's
77:48 - go go to our login page in here
77:51 - boom right there okay it will have a few
77:54 - things the first thing you will have is
77:55 - what
77:57 - um the first things we'll have is the
78:00 - content
78:01 - image no content oh
78:05 - okay you wonder okay yeah
78:10 - that wasn't me i know i don't know so
78:12 - content
78:13 - the reason why is look at this what
78:14 - we're going to create is very simple
78:16 - right
78:17 - we're going to make it look like a
78:18 - little bit like this you have the login
78:20 - page it will be like this
78:22 - it'll be the full screen then you have a
78:23 - smaller screen and that will have a
78:25 - button
78:26 - that will say login and this will have
78:28 - like the logo the amazon logo in here
78:30 - that's gonna be our goal for this okay
78:33 - oh yeah okay that's gonna be our goal so
78:36 - the content is gonna be
78:37 - this little kind of small portion so if
78:39 - you think about this
78:40 - the content is going to be this little
78:42 - small part that's going to be the
78:43 - content okay that's the content just so
78:45 - you know you guys know okay
78:46 - understood good so all right beautiful
78:50 - let's go and refresh this
78:52 - content is not defined let's do content
78:54 - style.there let's save that
78:57 - amazon logo is not defined no problem
78:59 - whatsoever that's completely fine
79:01 - amazon logos will be the image correct
79:03 - yes or no yeah
79:05 - style the image beautiful nice nice nice
79:07 - nice and then there's going to be a
79:09 - login
79:09 - button and then in the login button
79:12 - there's also going to be
79:13 - the right there h1
79:16 - actually sign into sign
79:19 - into sign in amazon sign into amazon
79:22 - right
79:24 - i mean why do we need a h1 because why
79:27 - not
79:28 - okay let's do it then yeah and then
79:32 - the login button let me go ahead and do
79:34 - it a little bit better better
79:36 - for you here the loginbot will have the
79:37 - following that will have the
79:39 - sign in with google so this will be here
79:42 - so we're actually going to guys sign in
79:44 - with google sign in with
79:46 - google google how sick is this guys
79:50 - sign in with google okay i know it looks
79:53 - hideous for now don't worry so much
79:54 - about this just yet okay
79:55 - we will go ahead and fix this in a
79:56 - second so now
79:59 - for the container this container the
80:01 - following things will happen
80:02 - here here we're gonna have the width of
80:05 - a hundred percent
80:08 - of a hundred percent boom good now
80:12 - after that what's going to happen is
80:13 - we'll have a height so we'll
80:15 - give this container a height check this
80:17 - out a height of
80:18 - 100 v h this means a hundred vertical
80:21 - height that's the full height
80:23 - of the web page guys just so you guys
80:25 - know okay
80:26 - okay then we're going to give the
80:28 - background color looks a little bit more
80:29 - like this
80:33 - boom right there that's a it's a little
80:35 - more grayish color
80:36 - right there so you can see right there
80:38 - that's the color right there looking for
80:39 - right there right you see
80:40 - then what's going to happen is the
80:42 - following will say then we'll actually
80:44 - in this case
80:45 - well oh no should we use grid for this
80:47 - one
80:49 - no we'll use display flex display flex
80:54 - nah i mean let's do grid this one time
80:57 - and then just let's use place items
80:59 - center okay
81:00 - okay okay display grid just fine right
81:04 - and then we'll what we are going to do
81:06 - is very simple
81:07 - is what place items
81:12 - items center
81:18 - holy moly that was quick quick and to
81:21 - the point
81:23 - look at this guys boom sign into amazon
81:25 - it's as simple as that understood
81:28 - there's still yes or no awesome next up
81:31 - next up what are we going to do tell me
81:34 - so next up i just copied a amazon logo
81:39 - um to my clipboard and what i'm going to
81:42 - be doing is i'm just going to be passing
81:44 - it in
81:44 - uh to the top uh if you
81:49 - okay let's think about this so here's
81:51 - what we'll do you have the amazon logo
81:53 - here so he's going to do the amazon logo
81:54 - he's going to pass it as an image
81:56 - right here that's awesome so save that
81:58 - oh that's huge
82:02 - don't worry don't worry we got you we
82:05 - got you we got you okay
82:07 - because here's what you do because the
82:09 - amazon logo and all we got to do is we
82:10 - got to give it a height so we say what
82:12 - we'll give it a height of 100 pixels
82:17 - oh yeah that's it okay all right all
82:19 - right
82:20 - now let's go to the content section okay
82:22 - let's go to the content section guys
82:24 - in the content section somebody said no
82:26 - flex
82:27 - display grid is like flex okay so this
82:30 - is great it's actually
82:31 - display flex vertical and horizontal
82:35 - combined exactly so we are still using
82:37 - display flex exactly so don't worry
82:38 - about this so far okay
82:40 - so now for the content here's what we'll
82:42 - do
82:43 - we'll give it a padding let me go ahead
82:46 - and show this to you guys so you guys
82:47 - have a little better
82:48 - padding of 100 pixels
82:52 - okay don't worry about that and then
82:54 - we'll give it a background color of
82:55 - white actually you'll see why in a
82:57 - second
83:02 - a white boom so you see there's a small
83:05 - little thing going on here okay like a
83:07 - color of white
83:08 - awesome so a bag okay good that's so
83:09 - that's good that makes it look really
83:11 - good
83:11 - and i'm going to give it a border radius
83:16 - of 5 pixels
83:20 - and then i'm going to give the box
83:22 - shadow
83:23 - a small back shadow box
83:26 - shadow okay that's going to be
83:30 - let's say well let's say 2 pixels
83:34 - now let's do zero one
83:37 - pixel three pixel
83:40 - that's going to be more of the
83:41 - background so black
83:45 - or maybe gray
83:49 - yeah i like that okay amazon send it to
83:52 - google i like that that's that's pretty
83:54 - good okay so that's good okay i like
83:55 - that guys that's amazing
83:57 - so now we got the amazon logo there that
84:00 - is awesome
84:00 - okay some said box show this this is
84:03 - good
84:04 - that is all good so now the question
84:06 - that becomes is going to be the
84:06 - following
84:07 - in the actual content i'm just going to
84:09 - give a text align center
84:13 - line center to align everything centered
84:16 - okay
84:16 - boom right there so amazon logo is
84:18 - centered assigned to amazon is also
84:20 - centered as well now
84:21 - the big thing that becomes is this sign
84:23 - in with google button that's the one
84:25 - thing we need to know
84:25 - really kind of focus on as well now for
84:28 - this image
84:29 - for this image well i want you guys to
84:30 - focus on let's go ahead and make it
84:32 - a margin margin
84:35 - bottom 40 pixels just to add some space
84:38 - into the bottom
84:40 - boom okay and let's get
84:43 - that room to breathe for the button as
84:45 - well
84:46 - and then yes of course and the login
84:48 - button of course will give it a margin
84:50 - top
84:52 - margin top of what 50 pixels
84:55 - um yeah that sounds good
84:59 - good good look at that so that's
85:02 - that's going to look a little bit better
85:04 - so that's amazing
85:05 - sign it to amazon sign in with google
85:07 - awesome now let's not change the actual
85:09 - button itself so we'll do
85:11 - background color this one right here
85:13 - actually um what would be the
85:14 - color should be orange no i it should be
85:17 - the usual
85:18 - amazon color so this one
85:21 - and we can give it a border radius with
85:24 - a border wait what does it say oh why
85:26 - does it not do what something was
85:27 - supposed to do let me refresh this
85:30 - login button right

87:26 - we've done so far so
87:27 - amazon logo sign into amazon now
87:30 - how do we actually use or how do we
87:32 - actually create the amazon sign up what
87:34 - do we actually do right so that's going
87:35 - to be ah what the heck
87:38 - so how do we go ahead and actually do
87:39 - this now so guys we have assigned into
87:41 - amazon that's so good
87:43 - what we can do is check this out guys
87:45 - okay check this out
87:47 - we can use firebase to sign in
87:50 - this is the the magic of firebase just
87:53 - so you guys know
87:54 - so let's think about this let's go to
87:56 - amazon not amazon
87:58 - let's go to firebase right there that's
88:00 - a good authentication
88:02 - okay everybody right now everybody goes
88:05 - nice
88:06 - get started
88:09 - good good we can do google we can do
88:12 - facebook pretty much anything you want
88:14 - we're going to go ahead and go and do
88:15 - google disabled
88:17 - we'll click enable all right that's so
88:19 - good let's go ahead that's the email we
88:20 - want to use that's fine click save
88:22 - turned on the backend for the
88:24 - authentication
88:26 - so what's up it's just funny to say that
88:29 - we just turned on the back end for the
88:30 - authentication
88:31 - exactly with a click of a button exactly
88:33 - with a click of a button right that's
88:34 - pretty much it so
88:35 - look with a click of a button now we
88:37 - have authentication through google guys
88:39 - that is it now of course we're not done
88:42 - there yet
88:42 - we have not finished it fully right we
88:44 - have to do the following now
88:46 - check this out okay to be able to use
88:49 - this
88:50 - we need to go ahead and fire us that gsm
88:52 - to be able to import this and actually
88:53 - use it properly so
88:54 - what we're going to do is we're going to
88:56 - do const auth so we know how we used
88:58 - uh db now we'll do we're going to use
89:00 - auth authentication so to const auth
89:03 - we'll say firebase dot what dot off
89:07 - boom right there firebase.auth and then
89:10 - we're going to now import the provider
89:11 - of the firebase auth which is going to
89:13 - be google which is looks a little bit
89:15 - like this
89:16 - book see right there provider
89:20 - is equal to new firebase off the google
89:23 - auth
89:23 - provider and all we gotta do now guys is
89:25 - we we export db
89:27 - and we also export provider
89:31 - that's it that's honestly pretty pretty
89:34 - much it
89:35 - we export the db and we export the
89:37 - provider as
89:39 - well that's guys that's literally it
89:41 - guys how sick is this huh
89:42 - that's pretty sick bro
89:46 - natalia's like fireball is so easy to
89:47 - use i love that i know
89:49 - trust me i love it too exactly okay cool
89:52 - so we got that so firebase
89:53 - off that looks amazing that looks
89:55 - amazing what we are going to do now is
89:57 - let's go ahead and go back
89:59 - to what go back to home.gs uh
90:02 - actually add that gs and the sign is
90:05 - going to happen
90:06 - on the login function login portion here
90:08 - so to sign in we're going to create a
90:10 - function called
90:11 - sign in this is going to be a function
90:15 - called sign in with google
90:17 - so go sign in so we'll say const sign in
90:21 - correct is equal to what
90:24 - boom right there awesome and we need to
90:27 - now go ahead and actually
90:28 - get the auth and the provider from
90:31 - firebase so as we'll do let's go and do
90:32 - this so we'll do this
90:34 - import import
90:40 - auth correct comma
90:43 - provider
90:46 - from where
90:50 - from firebase now yes exactly so from
90:54 - fire base beautiful on firebase now one
90:57 - thing if we go to firebase can i
90:59 - actually check this out if i go to
91:00 - firebase
91:01 - we are not exporting
91:06 - we need to be exporting auth comma
91:10 - db comma provider so we should be
91:13 - explaining all of these three things
91:14 - understood
91:18 - good good good good so save this so okay
91:21 - let's go ahead and go back to our app.js
91:24 - i see actually the login.js that's
91:26 - awesome
91:27 - okay so let's go ahead and do this now
91:29 - to do google off for example firebase
91:32 - firebase firebase google auth i'm going
91:35 - to show it to you guys
91:38 - boom this is so sick this is so cool
91:45 - web
91:49 - hold on look at this this is create
91:50 - email password
91:53 - this is google sign in
91:58 - you see this we created a provider right
92:02 - right and so forth now to sign in look
92:04 - at this guys
92:05 - auth sign well we're going to sign it
92:08 - with what
92:10 - sign in with pop-up sign in with pop-up
92:13 - look at this you see
92:14 - and then we need to pass it what
92:15 - provider we're going to use the provider
92:16 - is actually the google provider right
92:17 - there you see that right there
92:19 - and look at this when we get the result
92:21 - we get what we get the access token and
92:23 - we get the user
92:24 - right see the user right here guys
92:28 - the credentials and the user so how sick
92:31 - is that that's exactly what we need
92:33 - right so let's think about this right
92:34 - let's go back to our amazon clone
92:37 - okay okay oops all right
92:40 - boom boom awesome sign up let's go and
92:43 - save this to make sure it's all good
92:45 - mm-hmm does it say const what are you
92:48 - saying
92:49 - tab items as it before before it
92:53 - initialization
92:54 - i cannot access db i think it's probably
92:56 - because of
92:58 - firebase let me see
93:02 - oh i think wait no what oh because i do
93:05 - okay i know why actually export default
93:11 - tp oh but then we need to
93:14 - uh imported it that way
93:18 - [Music]
93:19 - that's fine that's fine let's go and go
93:21 - to our card.js
93:24 - i mean everywhere we imported it no but
93:27 - sure
93:28 - wait wait if we do export db off and all
93:31 - these tips shouldn't we tend to
93:32 - get that no yeah it should work
93:39 - let's see no no it's so good okay
93:42 - right there so db off and provider so
93:45 - that's all good right there
93:46 - so that is oh my water so that
93:49 - seems to be all good i think it's just
93:50 - probably a refresh that had to happen
93:51 - that was it that's pretty much
93:52 - it okay so that is all good that makes
93:55 - me happy
93:56 - and then look let's go to app.js now
93:58 - actually let's go to
93:59 - login.js which is pretty sick and then
94:02 - we'll do sign in with pop-up we'll pass
94:04 - in the provider which we imported from
94:05 - firebase right there awesome
94:08 - right there and then look at this we're
94:10 - now in the result
94:11 - we'll get what the result.user see
94:14 - result that you chose to var user
94:17 - or let's user is equal to result.user
94:22 - boom let's console.log it
94:26 - log what user
94:31 - right there okay console.log user and
94:34 - now on the catch for example let's say
94:36 - something happened and we did not sign
94:37 - in
94:38 - on the catch of it let's just say we
94:40 - have an error
94:43 - here you
94:47 - basically it's just here just an alert
94:49 - or maybe alert for example
94:53 - you know uh the error that message so

95:12 - resourceful developer this is about to
95:14 - be a developer who knows how to read

97:13 - so we got that portion that's awesome so
97:15 - we've signed in here that is amazing
97:17 - that is amazing
97:18 - so now let's think about this now okay
97:21 - let's think about this now how do we go
97:23 - ahead when do was the right time to log
97:25 - in when is the right time to actually
97:26 - show the user and everything
97:28 - that is a good question we're getting
97:29 - the user that is amazing but
97:31 - we actually need to be able to now set
97:34 - the user properly right
97:36 - that's going to be the quick question so
97:38 - this is where we used it comes back in
97:40 - again
97:40 - so now we need to actually go to app.js
97:43 - again and we need to actually create a
97:44 - state for the user here's we'll do
97:46 - let's do this so we'll say const
97:49 - oop go to show myself and me and you
97:53 - saw user set user is equal to
97:57 - use state
98:01 - state and so far it's just kind of
98:04 - nothing so far right so you state
98:06 - you know user just kind of so far as
98:08 - just you know
98:09 - there's nothing here let's just make
98:11 - that like that okay so it's an empty
98:13 - object okay
98:15 - okay simon says stephen says i love this
98:18 - yes thank you guys
98:20 - 358 likes guys guys share this more
98:23 - let's get to 400 likes because the more
98:24 - you help us the better this will be
98:26 - trust me trust me okay
98:29 - so good we got the user now the question
98:31 - becomes what do you do with that user
98:32 - well it's very simple guys
98:34 - right in the login functionality
98:38 - we need to set the user to what we just
98:40 - got from here
98:41 - it's as simple as that set the user to
98:44 - we just got from here so let's do this
98:45 - let's go to app.js how do we do that
98:46 - well
98:47 - in the app.js the user is here well
98:49 - let's pass it into the login so here
98:51 - we'll do your
98:52 - uh set user is equal to
98:56 - set user that's the ability for us to
98:59 - set a user right
99:00 - inside the app.js fully right set the
99:02 - user say user beautiful okay
99:04 - all right set user site user and what's
99:07 - going to somebody asking what is the
99:08 - program the program is amazon cloud guys
99:10 - just so you know
99:11 - so look set user say user and what's
99:13 - going to happen now in the login
99:14 - functionality
99:16 - will do what set user to what
99:21 - i mean say usually yeah like result that
99:25 - user
99:26 - right but not just that i don't wanna do
99:28 - that because i wanna be very particular
99:30 - about what user i want i don't wanna
99:32 - have all the data
99:33 - i don't need that but instead what i'm
99:35 - going to do you must say let the new
99:36 - user
99:38 - i mean what we can do is say uh
99:42 - user dot uh display name and user.email
99:47 - okay so here we'll do we'll do name
99:50 - right
99:50 - and we'll say what is it user dot
99:54 - dot display name display name
99:57 - comma boom okay and then what photo
100:00 - email i mean
100:03 - email to emote what is it user.what
100:07 - user.email okay then and then
100:10 - uh photo or yeah
100:13 - photo user dot i think it's
100:17 - photo url photo url yeah
100:20 - photo you are like this
100:24 - url full capitals yes yes correct
100:29 - yourself undefined that's fine so look
100:31 - at this now
100:32 - right so now guys we passed in the same
100:34 - set user okay
100:36 - we pass on the side user we need to be
100:38 - able to catch in the props here so we'll
100:39 - do set user right we cache this function
100:41 - inside here
100:42 - and now all we do is we do set user guys
100:44 - guys look at this
100:45 - set user to what the new
100:49 - user
100:52 - boom that said done right so send user
100:54 - to new user now
100:55 - here's the cool part okay here's the
100:57 - cool part let's think about this now
100:59 - app.js okay set new user okay if we
101:02 - let's go ahead and now console log the
101:03 - user just so we have it so console.log
101:07 - log this is so much fun guys how who
101:10 - here is having fun as much as we are
101:12 - user comma because i'm having a ton of
101:15 - fun
101:16 - parting with this stuff right
101:20 - so user user user good all right let's
101:23 - think about this now
101:24 - so let's go ahead and do this let's go
101:25 - ahead and inspect that one on here let
101:27 - me remove
101:28 - us so we don't have thus console good
101:31 - good good good good let's go and refresh
101:33 - this see user object is nothing so far
101:36 - no problem whatsoever but if i click on
101:37 - here if i go ahead and click on rafikaze
101:43 - think about it think about it boom right
101:45 - there that's our user right there see
101:47 - email is this name is this photo is this
101:50 - [Music]
101:56 - that is what i'm talking about
102:01 - beautiful all right so we got that
102:02 - portion guys that is epic okay
102:05 - somebody says having so much fun
102:08 - yes of course guys we're always about
102:10 - having fun so look
102:12 - now we've got that user guys check this
102:13 - out well look at this
102:15 - let's now use that think about this
102:16 - right we have this hello account nazari
102:19 - okay
102:19 - can we use this to be able to set the
102:21 - user hello nazari can we do that
102:23 - let's do that so look this is inside the
102:25 - header so last passed into the user into
102:27 - the header
102:28 - so say user is equal to what user
102:31 - boom done okay if we go to the header.js
102:37 - yes we're going to use the inside here
102:40 - okay boom voila
102:41 - and then now what let's actually use the
102:45 - proper name
102:46 - are you ready for this girl instead of
102:47 - pedal nazari you want to make sure that
102:51 - you just switch it with user dot name or
102:54 - yes user dot name user dot name
102:58 - oh look at that i know it looks a bit
103:01 - odd here because not totally user
103:02 - friendly look
103:03 - hello rafikaze guys
103:07 - how sick is this how sick is this this
103:11 - is amazing
103:12 - now we're not done yet okay we're not
103:13 - done yet because think about this we're
103:15 - not done yet right because
103:16 - of course we want to be able to one
103:19 - thing we need to want to be able to do
103:20 - is we need to remove this header portion
103:22 - very simply okay we want to be able to
103:24 - this does not need this portion right
103:26 - here you see that we get there
103:27 - so to do that it's going to be very very
103:29 - simple i mean it's not that simple but
103:31 - it's you need to understand it so here's
103:34 - going to happen
103:35 - here's the flow of this application
103:37 - right think about this
103:40 - if the user exists if the user is there
103:42 - that means
103:44 - that means what that means we are logged
103:46 - in if the user is not there it means we
103:48 - are not logged in correct
103:50 - so what we're going to do inside here in
103:52 - the router we're going to check for the
103:54 - user basically i'm going to say
103:55 - if there is no user so basically if the
103:58 - user state is not
104:00 - there we'll do the following we'll
104:03 - we'll show the login page the login page
104:06 - which is this one however
104:10 - if if guys however if we don't need this
104:13 - right here bro
104:15 - why oh i mean i mean that that's the
104:19 - whole point like that's fine too
104:21 - right boom right exactly let's go ahead
104:24 - now look think about this
104:25 - if the login is look but hold on
104:29 - give me one second let me get some water
104:30 - hold on this is so cool i want you to
104:32 - listen up really really closely
104:34 - okay all right
104:37 - now think about this guys
104:40 - if the user is there right there
104:44 - if there if there is no user if there's
104:46 - no user
104:47 - we just show the login page however
104:50 - if there is a user we show everything
104:52 - else right there you see
104:54 - so basically this prevents them from
104:57 - going to any other pages
104:58 - if they're not logged in it's as simple
105:00 - as that and now we don't even need
105:02 - this where is it where's the login route
105:05 - i already removed this
105:06 - man don't remove it i want to show them
105:08 - don't show it to them
105:10 - okay then it's not magic hold on what
105:13 - was it what happened here wait
105:16 - uh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
105:17 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
105:18 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
105:20 - wait wait i got it i got it i got i got
105:22 - it i got it
105:22 - it's fine it's fine it's fine i got it
105:24 - it's right there good so we used to have
105:26 - this login right here you see
105:28 - there's root path login we don't need
105:30 - that we just need this right here set
105:31 - user
105:33 - is equal to what user
105:37 - user exactly
105:40 - oh that's it guys and actually um notice
105:43 - that
105:44 - i did this squiggly brace over here and
105:46 - over here
105:48 - and it basically just shows that we are
105:50 - writing javascript
105:52 - in the html portion exactly and then i'm
105:56 - using html again and here as well
105:59 - exactly exactly so that's that's the
106:01 - power of jsx exactly right
106:03 - exactly but guys just so you know this
106:05 - right here is a shorthand for fl so this
106:07 - for example if
106:08 - yeah if for example here let me show it
106:10 - to you um
106:12 - so i mean we could we could have done
106:14 - this
106:16 - don't change don't you don't change it i
106:18 - got i got it don't you just typing it
106:19 - above
106:20 - okay i'll i type it i'll type it using a
106:22 - screen brush
106:24 - oh okay yeah so here if
106:28 - there is no user no user
106:33 - then look show login
106:39 - else
106:43 - show everything else
106:46 - that's the other part understood guys
106:48 - yes or no understood
106:50 - good show everything else this is a
106:52 - shorthand for ifl statement right there
106:54 - if this is true if this portion is true
106:57 - show this
106:58 - otherwise so now look at this guys
107:01 - if we say this uh
107:04 - let's put the token let's see if i don't
107:06 - know i would i was just uh gonna
107:09 - show them like exactly how uh the if
107:12 - works but no it's all good now look guys
107:15 - now of course look there's no login of
107:16 - course right here
107:17 - because why because the user exists yes
107:19 - or no
107:22 - yes or no right because exist remember
107:24 - how we logged in right this
107:26 - says this should say that i mean it
107:28 - should say hold on technically you
107:29 - should say what
107:31 - wait what
107:34 - oh don't worry i got it i got it
107:39 - so look i think let's go ahead and do
107:41 - this let's do user null
107:44 - oh yeah there we go so look at this
107:46 - right now
107:48 - user is nothing right they're null that
107:50 - means this will not fire so it's going
107:51 - to take you to the login page right
107:52 - there it's very simple okay
107:54 - right clean and clear then what's going
107:55 - to happen now there is no more header
107:58 - exactly exactly now if i go ahead and go
108:00 - i go ahead and go to sign in with google
108:06 - boom boom
108:09 - look at this we are in
108:12 - right there oh let's go
108:16 - how sick is that guys how cool is that
108:19 - now what i want us to do i want us to be
108:20 - able to create a the log out
108:22 - functionality as well right so let's go
108:24 - ahead and do this
108:24 - do it let's go and sign now function now
108:26 - now the signup functionality how how
108:28 - would that work out tell me guys what do
108:29 - you thinks think
108:31 - so what i would do is
108:34 - actually go to uh the header
108:38 - and then um are you following me
108:41 - yeah no i'm not have following you hold
108:43 - on i'll go to the head.gs
108:46 - yeah header.js and
108:49 - where is it this is it so what i would
108:51 - do is
108:53 - on click of this option line
108:56 - one oops right here
109:00 - oh yeah right here where is it
109:03 - on the click of this right here actually
109:06 - i would do it uh on the on this header
109:08 - option
109:08 - so one click unclick one click
109:12 - i would fire off a sign out function
109:15 - i would function now but the question is
109:18 - where do we get the signup function it's
109:19 - very simple guys you see
109:21 - first we need to create a signup
109:23 - function here so here's we'll do let's
109:24 - go to app.js
109:26 - let's create assign a function in here
109:27 - inside here we don't need we don't have
109:29 - to create it there we can create it i
109:30 - actually want to create it here because
109:31 - i want to pass into the whole header
109:33 - you'll see why later you'll see why it
109:35 - makes things easier so we'll do const
109:37 - sign out sign out right is equal to what
109:40 - is equal to sign out is equal to a
109:44 - function
109:45 - we're not passing oh yeah yes exactly
109:47 - and one way to do this is
109:49 - for first we actually need to sign out
109:51 - of the auth so the first thing to do is
109:53 - actually
109:53 - we need to in the firebase we'll do auth
109:56 - right here firebase
109:58 - and we'll do auth.sign out to remote to
110:00 - actually sign us out from the
110:02 - authentication of the actual in firebase
110:04 - in the database that's very important
110:06 - portion as well of course so that will
110:08 - fire that out and
110:10 - then guys no hold on hold on hold on bro
110:11 - hold on hold on hold on
110:13 - when that is all good when that is all
110:15 - good we'll do
110:16 - that then oh
110:20 - like that yes hold on
110:24 - oh yeah boom right that right there sign
110:27 - up right there see
110:28 - and so on success of the sign out what
110:30 - would you do say user to
110:33 - no not it
110:37 - yes sir so right there so the sign up
110:39 - function is this function right here
110:40 - okay now it's going to pass this into
110:42 - the header so go into the header right
110:45 - here
110:46 - i'm going to make this a little bit
110:47 - easier for us to read
110:49 - we'll do
110:52 - sign out
110:55 - is equal to what guys sign
110:59 - out sign up
111:02 - so now in the head of the gs let's go to
111:05 - hit the gs guys
111:06 - let's go ahead and and be able to
111:08 - actually catch that
111:10 - so do sign out okay
111:13 - and that's what that is going to do what
111:17 - that's going to make sure that we fire
111:20 - up the function
111:22 - what's up look at this and now we're
111:24 - going to click uh sign up on this one
111:26 - and that's pretty much it now
111:27 - you can see that it took us back to
111:28 - assignment with google no problem
111:29 - whatsoever since we'll do sign up google
111:32 - again
111:34 - let's go after qazi
111:37 - boomer in now if i click on this
111:40 - boom we're signed out
111:44 - understood how cool is that guys look at
111:48 - that we've signed out let's go sign in
111:49 - again
111:52 - boom
111:55 - boom right there look at this guys let
111:57 - me go on the on click of this one let's
111:58 - go back to
111:59 - uh i heard that yes here for a second
112:01 - okay let's go ahead gs
112:03 - let's go ahead and do where it's like
112:05 - for example this header option
112:08 - let's do this should be uh
112:12 - cursor pointer
112:15 - pointer all right that makes sense boom
112:19 - right there awesome so that way if i
112:22 - click on here
112:23 - oh again how satisfying is this guys
112:27 - how satisfying is this i would say it's
112:30 - pretty satisfying
112:31 - would you say so yeah exactly it is
112:34 - and it's actually more secure though oh
112:36 - something happened there's an error
112:37 - there's something here please try again
112:38 - later that's all we know another google
112:40 - let's try again
112:41 - let's do nazari now
112:45 - oh there we go hello nazare domanski
112:49 - hi good to see you
112:51 - [Laughter]
112:54 - you know what i mean so there you go
112:55 - that's pretty awesome so look we got
112:57 - that portion
112:58 - we're gonna get we can sign out again
113:00 - right send it with google again
113:01 - we'll do one more time just double check
113:03 - to make sure it's all good
113:06 - good it's so good now here's the issue
113:07 - guys if i refresh
113:10 - it takes me back to here oh
113:13 - here's the issue see here's why because
113:16 - the state
113:18 - the state every time i refresh the page
113:20 - the state gets cleared out
113:22 - that's it so the state gets cleared out
113:24 - time refers the page fully
113:27 - right so this is where we need to be
113:29 - careful we need to use something called
113:30 - local storage guys
113:31 - okay local storage is your browser
113:34 - storage imagine this guys
113:35 - your browser has a storage kind of how
113:38 - think about it as almost its own state
113:40 - as well right but this storage is there
113:42 - for a really long time
113:44 - so check this out here's what we can do
113:46 - we can use something called local
113:48 - storage let's go
113:48 - to our app.gs and actually go to log in
113:52 - the gs and here's what we'll do guys
113:54 - when we log in we'll do it like this
113:58 - this is going to be really cool guys pay
114:01 - attention to this right now really
114:02 - quickly guys
114:02 - okay when we do say user not only we're
114:05 - going to say user here
114:06 - we're also going to set it inside the
114:08 - local storage so look at this
114:10 - local storage dot
114:14 - set item this comes directly from uh
114:17 - from the browser it comes
114:18 - it's a functionality we can use directly
114:20 - from the browser right
114:22 - side item boom set item
114:25 - right and what are we going to say user
114:28 - right there
114:29 - we're going to set the user and to
114:31 - actually set the user of this one
114:34 - we'll use this right here
114:37 - oh right there you're gonna pass into
114:39 - yeah so now what this does is very
114:41 - simple
114:42 - it takes this new user object and it's
114:44 - going to create it into a string into a
114:46 - json string it's as simple as that okay
114:48 - because the local storage only accepts
114:50 - strings just so you guys know okay it
114:52 - doesn't accept
114:52 - objects this new user is an object and
114:54 - here we're going to convert to a string
114:56 - right so look at this now right and then
114:59 - what's going to happen after we
115:00 - see that in local storage now we can get
115:03 - it back
115:04 - if i go to myapp.js inside here you see
115:08 - how we initialize the state to null
115:11 - what if what if instead of doing that
115:14 - we initialized it by what we get
115:17 - from the from the get item so here's
115:19 - what we can do
115:20 - we can do this let me show it to you
115:24 - guys here look okay here
115:25 - it's a good item right boom
115:28 - oh boom boom
115:32 - local storage decay item so we'll get
115:34 - the item back
115:36 - from local storage of the data of our
115:37 - browser and we'll parse that string into
115:40 - an actual
115:41 - object okay so that will that we can use
115:43 - the object and now
115:45 - this will allow us to fully fully fully
115:48 - use that so let's think about this guys
115:50 - let's go and do this okay ready for this
115:53 - bro
115:54 - ready i am ready let's go so
115:57 - sign in with google boom
116:01 - let's use nazari domanski
116:05 - okay good biannual damansky all is great
116:08 - awesome okay
116:09 - now look if i refresh oh we're still in
116:12 - the zarya dumansky
116:14 - look at that now here's local storage
116:17 - guys
116:18 - here's the local storage check this out
116:19 - i want you to pay attention to here
116:20 - really quickly
116:22 - console this
116:25 - console console where is it uh no
116:29 - you need to go into storage don't you
116:30 - application no oh application oh it's in
116:33 - safari that's boom
116:35 - look at this user is this
116:38 - person this is my name
116:42 - my email and here's my photo url
116:45 - guys it is as simple as
116:48 - that how sick is that you tell me
116:54 - how sick is this huh wow
116:57 - that was new for me too that was pretty
116:59 - awesome i would say so huh
117:00 - guys that's super cool that's pretty
117:02 - cool right so and now look at this now
117:04 - now of course the thing is here look at
117:06 - this if we sign out
117:10 - it's not going to work actually it will
117:12 - work
117:13 - nope won't work yeah it'll take me to
117:16 - here but it won't work
117:18 - here why because on the side now we need
117:21 - to clear out the local storage don't we
117:23 - exactly because we're not cleaning local
117:25 - stores so what do we do inside here on
117:26 - the site user
117:27 - here now not only was a user to know but
117:30 - also also we set the local storage so
117:33 - let's say local storage
117:36 - storage the what
117:39 - item remove item oh
117:43 - wow and uh i'm just curious like
117:47 - it just came to my mind like uh how long
117:49 - does it actually store
117:51 - my user so if i log in until you click
117:54 - until you clear the storage in your
117:55 - browser until you clear cookies and
117:57 - you're stored in your browser until that
117:59 - wow yeah so it's gonna be there for a
118:00 - long time
118:02 - wow exactly so look let's try this again

123:32 - firebase in it
123:34 - now don't you do run a build

124:06 - march 21st that's the one we're going to
124:08 - use you see that right there just click
124:09 - enter from that what do you want to use
124:13 - now this alert like
124:16 - yeah you want to change that to build
124:18 - don't move forward until you've changed
124:20 - that
124:21 - to build very important guys this needs
124:23 - to be this right here guys
124:25 - needs to be okay that
124:28 - needs to be built okay keep that in mind
124:32 - build build build build okay if you miss
124:35 - that
124:36 - you will have to redo the whole thing
124:38 - again yes delete all the config files
124:40 - too much hassle make sure that it's set
124:42 - to build
124:43 - okay so build hit enter yep
124:47 - okay figure it out you have to configure
124:49 - it as a single
124:50 - jab once again type in why
124:53 - stay uh uh yup no need for this one that
124:56 - deploys for github no need to do that
124:58 - nope and you don't need that that's it
125:01 - so it's initialized
125:03 - now this is where the build process
125:05 - starts
125:06 - so you want to type in npm uh run
125:10 - build that would just basically go ahead
125:13 - strip out all the
125:15 - developer stuff from the application
125:17 - like the hot reloading and all that
125:19 - stuff
125:20 - um and it's just going to create an
125:22 - optimized production build
125:26 - and once that's let's see let's see
125:30 - let's see
125:30 - see there's the build folder you see so
125:32 - what it's doing guys what's going on
125:34 - here is very simple guys
125:35 - it's taking all this react that you have
125:37 - right here it's putting into
125:39 - javascript and it's putting into the
125:41 - build folder right here so it becomes
125:42 - like a normal just page app okay
125:45 - exactly so that's little with that you
125:46 - see right there it created this all
125:48 - these files so
125:49 - if you go to build folder look at this
125:50 - we have the inside html
125:52 - you see this is all minimized and it's
125:54 - all minimized and then what we have here
125:55 - is we have static and these are
125:57 - all javascript files right there all
126:00 - these look at this too
126:01 - look at this guys all of these are
126:04 - javascript files right there you see
126:05 - it's all one huge line
126:07 - but it's all there guys it is literally
126:09 - all there you see it's called minimize
126:11 - javascript but it converted your react
126:12 - gs
126:13 - to javascript just so you know okay
126:16 - exactly and uh once you're done you can
126:19 - just type in firebase deploy
126:21 - to this enjoy firebase deploy good boy
