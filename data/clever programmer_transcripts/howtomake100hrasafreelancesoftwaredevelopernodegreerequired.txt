00:00 - - Hey guys!
00:01 - How is it going?
00:01 - This is Qazi from CleverProgrammer.com,
00:04 - and in this video we're
gonna talk about how you
00:06 - can become a freelance software developer
00:08 - and you can start to charge $100 an hour
00:12 - without needing a college degree.
00:14 - So without any further ado,
let's jump right into it.
00:18 - (dynamic music)
00:29 - So, first of all, let's start off
00:31 - with one of the really important things,
00:34 - why you actually need a college degree.
00:43 - So, a college degree generally is needed
00:46 - because you need to have
something that you can show,
00:50 - but if you don't have a college degree
00:53 - you need to have something
else to show in place for it.
00:55 - That's the number one primary reason
00:57 - why most people actually work so hard
00:59 - to pursue that degree and a lot of people,
01:02 - it doesn't matter how old you are,
01:03 - if you're going for that college degree,
01:05 - it's to basically say hey, I don't have
01:07 - any other experience to show for it,
01:09 - but I'll show you my college degree.
01:12 - Now, there are alternative to this.
01:20 - Meaning that, if you can prove your worth
01:22 - to somebody else, you
don't need to show them
01:26 - you have a college degree.
01:27 - They frankly don't even care.
01:29 - So, for some companies it's experience
01:33 - and as a freelance developer,
01:34 - it's not even necessarily experience,
01:37 - it's you being able to
prove to somebody else
01:39 - you can develop a software for them
01:42 - that can help them grow their business.
01:45 - So, if it's a startup you're working for,
01:47 - maybe they need an application
01:48 - and you're using a framework
like Django and Python
01:51 - to develop a web application.
01:53 - Well, you can simply
build them an application
01:57 - and make sure that it's
something that they want,
01:59 - that's something that they can use,
02:02 - and if it's generating them more money
02:05 - by you providing your skillset,
02:08 - then they don't care.
02:09 - At Clever Programmer one
of the things that we need
02:12 - is to create a companion
app for all the stuff
02:17 - that I teach you guys, so
I have programming courses
02:20 - in Python and I want to
make it really easy for you.
02:24 - So I might actually hire out a developer
02:27 - to make an app for me, and
if they have any experience
02:32 - in creating apps and we
have like a live interview
02:34 - and they can just show me
that they can create it,
02:36 - and it's something that
could actually be scaled
02:38 - to all of the students
'cause right now we have
02:41 - over 10,000 students at Clever Programmer.
02:44 - So, if we can create that
app and you guys can use it,
02:48 - well, as a business Clever
Programmer will instantly
02:51 - be making more money, and for me to pay
02:55 - the software developer, it's
something that's very easy.
02:58 - So, if the developer charges $100 an hour
03:02 - and he takes five, 10, or 15,
or 20 hours to make the thing,
03:06 - which is $2,000, if my
return on investment on that
03:11 - is like, let's say $10,000,
or even let's say $5,000,
03:15 - I mean do I care paying
the developer $2,000?
03:19 - No.
03:20 - It's a matter of triviality
at that point, right.
03:22 - That's how Ramit Sethi would say,
03:24 - it's somebody I follow,
and you can look him up,
03:27 - and he teaches you like lots of ways
03:29 - you can earn a higher income.
03:31 - So, ultimately the point
is being able to prove
03:35 - your worth to somebody else
03:39 - whether it's through a college degree
03:40 - or it's through different projects,
03:42 - or you being able to
convince somebody else
03:44 - that you can actually help
them and provide them value.
03:47 - Also by value what I mean
is getting them a result
03:50 - that they care about and that they want.
03:52 - For most businesses and most
people who are hiring you,
03:54 - think it from their perspective.
03:58 - They're not necessarily looking for
04:02 - a beautiful website,
04:04 - most people are looking for, you know,
04:07 - the reason behind why they want a website,
04:10 - which is to generate
more business for them.
04:13 - So, using your programming knowledge,
04:18 - if you can put something together for them
04:20 - that they can sell, or they can use it
04:24 - to bring in new leads, new customers,
04:32 - leads just means somebody
who, you know, you have
04:36 - their contact information
and they are interested
04:38 - in either your services or your product,
04:41 - and if they can use it
to then turn those people
04:44 - into customers, they are happy.
04:45 - For example.
04:46 - Let's say that you want to build
04:49 - a website for a photographer.
04:52 - Well, how would you go about it?
04:55 - Would you just pitch it to them like,
04:57 - hey, I have my college
degree, you're a freelancer
05:02 - for photography, just hire me.
05:05 - Well, in that case they
might not even care,
05:07 - they're like hey, yeah, that's cool
05:09 - you have a college degree and all,
05:10 - but I don't know how that's
really applicable to me.
05:13 - But now let's say you reframe this,
05:16 - you go up to that same
photographer and you say
05:18 - hey, so I notice that each person
05:21 - whose information that you
get, out of every 10 people
05:24 - one of those people becomes your customer,
05:26 - is that right?
05:27 - And then they're like yeah,
that's actually right.
05:30 - How much is that one client,
a customer worth to you?
05:32 - And freelance photographer
might be like, $2,000.
05:37 - So you're like okay, so one
client to you is worth $2,000.
05:42 - And they're like yes.
05:43 - So then you're like
okay, so out of 10 people
05:47 - if one person gives you $2,000,
05:49 - then what's the average
on those 10 people?
05:52 - Right?
05:53 - So let's, that's simple,
let's divide 2000 by 10,
05:59 - and we should get something like 200.
06:03 - So that means that each
new lead or each new,
06:08 - you know, person who is
interested in that freelancer
06:12 - is essentially worth $200 to them.
06:16 - Right?
06:17 - So now imagine you were a Python developer
06:19 - and you needed to put
together a website for them.
06:22 - It could be a simple website.
06:24 - So you could even go to
them and just say hey,
06:26 - I'm gonna put a simple
website together for you.
06:29 - Now, if you are helping them generate
06:33 - let's say instead of 10 new
leads or potential customers,
06:37 - let's say you're helping
them get 50 new customers,
06:41 - leads per month, how much
is that worth to them?
06:46 - Out of 50 people, if five people give
06:50 - that freelancer photographer business,
06:53 - now that freelance photographer
instead of making $2,000,
06:58 - now he has five people per month,
07:00 - he's making $10,000 per month.
07:03 - Right?
07:05 - So, could you safely charge
that freelancer $5,000
07:10 - to put together a website
that gets business for him?
07:15 - Right?
07:16 - And if you convince that
photographer of this,
07:18 - or show him this,
07:23 - then he doesn't care, and
you're able to make $5,000,
07:28 - you can frankly name your price.
07:30 - So saying $100 an hour as a
freelance software developer
07:33 - is an understatement, but
I just have to do that
07:37 - so when I'm making this
video, it doesn't sound
07:39 - like scammy, right, it
doesn't sound too unrealistic.
07:43 - But this is very possible.
07:44 - So, as a freelancer you
need to think of yourself
07:48 - as a business and all
the people that you get,
07:51 - think of them as a client.
07:54 - Think of each person not as
like your employer or whatever,
07:58 - they're just, each of
them are your client.
08:01 - And the beautiful thing here is
08:02 - that you can fire your clients.
08:09 - You know, a lot of the times firing
08:11 - 70% to 80% of your clients
08:13 - and focusing on only
some of the premium ones
08:16 - and then giving them more services
08:18 - can actually increase your income
08:21 - and you don't have to
deal with a lot of people
08:23 - who are like nagging at you,
08:24 - right, or you don't like dealing with.
08:27 - So that's another beauty of a
freelancer software developer
08:30 - because it's not like if you go
08:33 - to that nine to five job
and you don't like it,
08:35 - then you're just kind of
stuck there doing one thing.
08:37 - Here you can choose and
create your own path
08:41 - and kind of name your price.
08:44 - And the smarter you can
think like a business,
08:47 - then you have infinite
growth, and the great thing is
08:50 - you can turn into an agency over time.
08:53 - But in the start, you
know, one step at a time.
08:55 - The first step is getting that one client.
08:58 - So don't just say hey, I just have
09:00 - this one really cool
skill and I can help you,
09:02 - I'm just a cool painter,
so I'm just gonna paint,
09:05 - or I'm a cool designer, so
I'm just gonna do designing.
09:07 - Think of it how you can help
them earn more business,
09:11 - and then frame it from that perspective.
09:15 - They're much more likely
to hire you, and honestly,
09:18 - you could even charge way
more than $100 an hour.
09:21 - Because if you can
deliver somebody results,
09:24 - you can put together that website
09:25 - for that freelance photographer, right,
09:27 - that's not even a business,
09:28 - just that freelance photographer example
09:30 - that I was talking about earlier,
09:32 - and that website takes you, let's say,
09:34 - an hour or two hours to put
together, you can charge $5,000,
09:40 - and it's not tied to your hourly income,
09:42 - it's tied to the result
you're providing them.
09:45 - Okay, that's how you
can start to break away
09:47 - from that hourly mindset and
start to go into higher profits
09:53 - because you're giving better results,
09:55 - right, you're selling a result.
09:58 - So, with all of that, to summarize,
10:04 - think of yourself as a business.
10:10 - Everybody else is a client.
10:12 - Working as a freelancer is actually safer
10:16 - than working at a job, because
a job is just one client.
10:21 - Whereas if you have 20 different clients
10:25 - you can even choose to fire
10:27 - someone you don't like to work with.
10:31 - You have flexibility to work remotely.
10:33 - You have flexibility to
work with whoever you want,
10:36 - and basically however
much income you need.
10:38 - You can increase the
number of clients you get.
10:41 - And as a bonus tip, if you are in college,
10:45 - or using some form of learning,
you know, going to school,
10:50 - that's one resource, right.
10:54 - That's not the only place.
10:55 - Just like when you are at a job, you think
10:57 - the job is the only place
you can go and get an income.
11:00 - You can go to a job and still have
11:02 - freelancing gigs on the side
11:04 - to earn an extra income, just like that.
11:06 - If you're actually learning,
like from a college,
11:09 - you can use other
resources to learn as well,
11:13 - and you have to treat
college just like that,
11:15 - one resource and you can't
learn from anywhere else.
11:19 - Alright?
11:20 - So, hopefully, this gives
you some perspective
11:22 - of how it's actually possible
to generate $100 an hour
11:27 - or even more as freelancer
software developer.
11:30 - I just gave you a very simple example
11:32 - and it doesn't even require
all that complicated knowledge.
11:36 - The example I gave you
is literally being able
11:38 - to charge a ton of money just for building
11:41 - a website for somebody.
11:43 - Right?
11:44 - But now think of, as a Python developer
11:47 - you are offering much more
custom solutions to a company,
11:51 - and these custom solutions can be like
11:54 - providing them with
actionable data analytics,
11:57 - proving to somebody that hey,
based on how much traffic
12:01 - you're getting and how
much conversion you have,
12:03 - if you change this one thing,
12:05 - it'll improve your growth tremendously.
12:08 - For example, somebody helped
me, a Python developer,
12:12 - they did some data analytics
at Clever Programmer
12:14 - and they were able to tell me that hey,
12:16 - if you focus more on creating
better videos for people,
12:19 - or if you focus more on giving people
12:22 - an offer that's better for them,
12:24 - it can actually help you in your business,
12:26 - and it has helped me at Clever Programmer,
12:29 - because I'm able to help
people in a better way
12:32 - and that data insight that they gave me
12:34 - was actually super actionable for me
12:36 - and something that I immediately
12:37 - started to get results from.
12:40 - That way for you, as a Python developer,
12:42 - because you're offering
such customized solutions,
12:45 - you could charge even higher than that.
12:48 - So, hopefully, this makes sense.
12:52 - Shoot me in comments below.
12:54 - If you guys have any more
questions about this,
12:56 - I'd love to jump in and
answer that for you.
12:58 - For now, this is it guys.
13:00 - Thank you guys so much for watching!
13:02 - And, as always, I love your faces off
13:04 - and I'll see you in the next video!
