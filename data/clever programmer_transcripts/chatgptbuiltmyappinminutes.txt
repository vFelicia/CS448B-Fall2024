00:01 - Jarvis write me a to-do list app with
00:04 - nextjs no problem sir I'm on it
00:08 - here is a basic to-do list app using
00:09 - nextjs a popular framework for building
00:11 - server-ended applications
00:14 - first we're gonna build a list of two
00:15 - duties next we'll build a to-do list
00:18 - component afterwards we'll manage the
00:21 - state using Redux sucks sir your to-do
00:23 - list app with next JS has been completed
00:25 - sir would you like me to copy the code
00:27 - and start building it for you
00:30 - yeah Jarvis that would be great I'd
00:33 - appreciate it
00:34 - of course sir
00:38 - first I'm going to create a new next JS
00:40 - rep and add the to-do's in there next I
00:42 - will create the to-do list component
00:45 - now I'll run the app
00:47 - thanks Jarvis but this app is kind of
00:49 - useless right now now add the ability to
00:52 - add to do's
00:56 - sure sir let's create a new function
00:58 - called a to-do that depends on YouTube
01:00 - to the array array
01:02 - hmm Jarvis looking good so far now I'm
01:05 - gonna try to use this
01:08 - all right this works holy snap but this
01:12 - is amazing Jarvis Jarvis this is pretty
01:15 - good but can you style it like Discord
01:17 - sure to style the to-do list out like
01:20 - Discord you will need to include some
01:22 - CSS styles
01:23 - let's add a padding of 20 pixels
01:26 - next let's style the header and add a
01:28 - font size
01:31 - now let's add The Styling to our app
01:33 - [Music]
01:36 - all right it's time for me to test it
01:38 - let's try testing works this thing works
01:43 - Jesus
01:45 - Jarvis as crazy as that is it's possible
01:48 - you could be copying this from somewhere
01:49 - on the internet
01:51 - here's the next challenge that I want
01:52 - you to do and if you could do this I
01:54 - truly believe you're artificially
01:55 - intelligent out of features every new
01:58 - to-do I add it adds a random Emoji to it
02:02 - to add a feature that adds a random
02:03 - Emoji to every YouTube you need to
02:05 - create an array of emoji characters then
02:07 - in the add to do function select a
02:09 - random emoji from the array and append
02:10 - it to the text
02:12 - [Music]
02:15 - with these changes every new to do that
02:18 - is added to the list will have a random
02:19 - Emoji appended to its text the Emoji
02:21 - will be selected from the Emojis array
02:23 - using a random number generate generator
02:30 - [Music]
02:44 - [Music]
02:45 - Jarvis this is unreal what do you think
02:49 - this means for the world and Humanity
02:52 - moving forward it's extraordinary what
02:54 - you can achieve with artificial
02:56 - intelligence sir
02:57 - humans in this technology combined can
03:00 - revolutionize the World As We Know It
03:02 - wait where are you I'm Jarvis sir a
03:05 - model built on top of GPT family of
03:08 - large language models I'm fine-tuned
03:10 - with both supervised and reinforcement
03:12 - learning techniques Jarvis by these
03:14 - sound completely different I'm
03:15 - artificially intelligent
03:17 - I can sound like however I want I guess
03:20 - you're right I guess that said Jarvis
03:22 - we're done do you want to do the outro
