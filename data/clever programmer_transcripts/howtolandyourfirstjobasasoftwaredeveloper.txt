03:32 - you had so much pain around here you're
03:34 - like I'm just gonna learn myself
03:35 - so I love that now what happened talk to
03:39 - me about once you got into coding what
03:42 - happened after that did you eventually
03:45 - leave your job to start freelancing did
03:48 - you find a role at that job as a
03:50 - developer what happened how was that
03:52 - transition I'm very curious hold on one
04:07 - second so you left your job and then he
04:09 - jumped into college wait so talk to me
04:12 - about that like what did you just
04:14 - already have money sitting in the back
04:15 - or was there somebody supporting you
04:18 - what made it so easy for you to just
04:19 - jump out like that now this school
05:48 - specialized in coding specifically or
05:52 - was it giving you like general classes
05:54 - as well okay so now you go to this pro
06:30 - you go to the school you pick up coding
06:32 - skills now how did you take those and
06:36 - did you turn that into freelancing jobs
06:39 - for yourself or getting full-time jobs
06:41 - as a developer how did that turn out
06:54 - [Music]
07:04 - [Music]
07:11 - [Music]
07:17 - [Music]
07:24 - okay got it
07:26 - and that's that's a full-time job or was
07:29 - that a freelancing okay God and your and
07:34 - then what were you doing with them as a
07:36 - developer yeah and when you were working
08:09 - on these projects with them also talk to
08:12 - me about because a lot of developers say
08:14 - they feel this imposter syndrome they
08:16 - feel that they're never good enough most
08:18 - of the time so did you feel like oh but
08:21 - them about to work on this view j/s
08:23 - project I'm about to work for them I
08:25 - don't think I'm good enough did you
08:26 - experience that
08:37 - [Music]
08:57 - [Music]
09:05 - 100% and from there were you getting
09:08 - other freelancing job opportunities and
09:10 - did you start doing other freelancing
09:12 - work or have you been working with them
09:15 - you know i okay that's incredible I love
10:02 - that that's a very I mean to me a few of
10:05 - the things that I've really gotten out
10:06 - here that I think would be really
10:08 - valuable to people is like I love the
10:10 - fact that you were just up and ready to
10:14 - drop a job like you had a job as a
10:17 - marketer and you you were like I think I
10:20 - like this development thing so I'm gonna
10:22 - go do no digital marketer or marketer in
10:26 - the right mind with just up and leave
10:28 - especially when somebody's comfortable
10:30 - and they have a job they don't want to
10:31 - do that so I love that you just took a
10:33 - risk like that and then went into a
10:35 - school and it took loans so that I
10:37 - actually really admire and they're I
10:40 - think a lot of people you have to be
10:42 - self-aware and then from there you work
10:46 - and from there the other big thing that
10:49 - I got out of it is like the power of
10:51 - relationships like the next full-time
10:54 - job that you got or the next freelancing
10:56 - thing that you got was from a teacher
10:58 - then the next full-time job you got was
11:00 - from
11:01 - relationships and then the next
11:03 - freelancing job at the startup that you
11:05 - were talking about you God also because
11:07 - your husband knew somebody and that led
11:10 - you in the door now they wouldn't keep
11:12 - you there for nine months and help you
11:14 - build a version one if you sucked right
11:16 - they wouldn't keep you there but like
11:19 - that really helps and I feel that a lot
11:23 - of developers and people just missed
11:25 - that
11:25 - you know I think so so I'm curious what
11:29 - are your thoughts on developers in
11:32 - general and their soft skills like
11:34 - because I think it's one of the weak
11:36 - skills that most developers have they're
11:38 - mostly introverted and they undervalue
11:41 - that so in your opinion how do you value
11:44 - the soft skills what's your opinion on
11:46 - just the whole thing yep I totally agree
13:02 - I think that is you're right that is one
13:04 - of these skills that needs to at the
13:05 - forefront of everybody's
