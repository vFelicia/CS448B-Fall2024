00:00 - hey guys how's it going this is Kazi
00:01 - from clever programmer calm welcome back
00:04 - so we did the lowercase and uppercase
00:07 - challenge let's jump into the Swiss
00:09 - switch-case challenge and like I said to
00:13 - some of you guys some of you guys have
00:14 - actually already solved it it's a great
00:16 - job on that perfect our mic is up and
00:20 - running okay so how are we going to do
00:23 - this challenge well first of all let's
00:25 - understand what the actual problem is so
00:27 - the problem says if I gave you something
00:29 - like I don't know h-e-l-l-o GL and all
00:34 - caps if I gave you any letter just give
00:38 - me the opposite casing of it if I give
00:40 - you a small H
00:41 - give me a capital H if I give you a
00:43 - small capital II give me a small e and
00:47 - if I gave you a word with like small
00:49 - followed by big give me big followed by
00:53 - small ok I think it makes sense to
00:55 - here's some examples so it says like if
00:57 - I call switch case function on arg an
01:00 - exclamation mark return to me
01:04 - small a capital r capital g exclamation
01:08 - mark okay so let's think about how we
01:11 - are going to do this there is a built in
01:13 - method but I challenge you to try to do
01:15 - it without the built-in method okay some
01:18 - of you guys have already solved using to
01:19 - build built-in Python methods a good job
01:22 - on that ok so how can we go about this
01:26 - well let's think about it right
01:29 - obviously I want you to actively try the
01:31 - side if you're on my website you can
01:32 - code right below this video without
01:34 - having to open up your own command line
01:37 - so what I would say is like hey I would
01:40 - like to create a new string and I want
01:43 - to just be emptying the start and then
01:46 - what I'll do is also for a letter and
01:48 - string so basically a loop through the
01:50 - string that I'm given so if I'm given
01:51 - hello I want to like loop through the H
01:54 - and the E and the L and L and O and what
01:56 - I want to do is as I'm looping through
01:58 - if I see the H I want to check if it's
02:02 - in lowercase if it is then I want to
02:03 - uppercase it and throw it in the new
02:05 - string if the H is in lowercase then I
02:08 - want our sorry fit the H is already in
02:10 - the uppercase then I want to lowercase
02:12 - it and throw it in
02:13 - new string makes sense so let's give
02:17 - that a try for letter and string if
02:19 - letter dot there's a method that
02:22 - actually detects if something is lower
02:24 - or upper the method is actually called
02:26 - is lower that's for checking something
02:30 - is lower is lower than what I want to do
02:34 - is new string plus equals letter dot
02:42 - upper okay else new string plus equals
02:50 - letter dot lower and that should do the
02:55 - trick let's hit the play button let's
02:57 - see what we get and for arrgh
03:00 - we got something oh yeah we have to
03:03 - return the new string the one that we
03:06 - created okay and it looks beautiful so
03:10 - we have Arg capital a small our small G
03:13 - and we're getting back small a capital R
03:16 - capital G and for trinket you can see
03:19 - that it's switch cased the trinket as
03:21 - well perfectly and if you want to take
03:24 - your time walk through this code do that
03:27 - because you know this one is not so
03:29 - trivial I went through it fast but it's
03:31 - this one is not so simple you know walk
03:35 - through this and just notice how I loop
03:38 - through this and when I say a loop you
03:40 - know I just want you guys to be clear
03:42 - what I mean by that so I'm going to open
03:44 - this up my command line here and just
03:46 - for a letter in hello print letter and
03:55 - you'll see that the first loop gave me H
03:58 - the next loop gave me e to the next look
04:00 - after that eme L and basically what I'm
04:04 - doing is I want to say is lower and I
04:07 - should get five crews back because
04:10 - they're all lower and if I do the same
04:12 - thing and I call that upper is upper it
04:17 - just says false false false false
04:18 - so using that boolean logic that if and
04:21 - else type of logic I was able to detect
04:24 - if it was lower and if it was I just
04:27 - per case it and threw it back remember
04:29 - what we learned in our lower case
04:30 - challenge and then if it was lower case
04:32 - and made I made it upper case and I
04:34 - threw it back in the new string from
04:36 - what we learned in the upper case
04:37 - challenge well that's it guys for this
04:40 - video thank you guys so much for
04:42 - watching and as always I love you guys
04:43 - so much and I'll see you in the next
04:45 - video
