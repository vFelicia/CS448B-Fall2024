00:00 - you're sitting there you're writing your
00:02 - code
00:03 - you're working on your application
00:06 - but it's just not working
00:12 - you feel like hey i've been coding this
00:15 - up but i ran into a problem and now i
00:18 - cannot get past this problem
00:21 - so you give up on that coding project
00:23 - and then maybe you start another one
00:25 - and then you give up on that project and
00:26 - you start another one and you give up on
00:28 - that project so one of the things
00:30 - i want to talk about today is stop
00:33 - sitting there and writing code
00:36 - it's one of the things that's stopping
00:37 - you from actually getting better at it
00:44 - better at coding becoming better at
00:47 - software development
00:50 - actually has very little to do with
00:53 - sitting there
00:53 - and writing code
00:56 - a lot of it is having to learn how to
01:00 - think
01:00 - like a software developer like an
01:03 - engineer
01:05 - so a ton of your time should actually be
01:09 - spent
01:09 - on contemplation
01:13 - coming up with ideas coming up with
01:16 - possible solutions a lot of your time
01:20 - should be actually spent on
01:21 - documentation and research
01:24 - if most of your time is spent coding
01:28 - you're not going to be making a lot of
01:30 - progress
01:33 - because at the end of the day coding as
01:35 - fun as it is
01:36 - it gets into you doing sometimes just
01:38 - like straight up grunt work
01:40 - okay so you have to sit there and
01:43 - actually think about things and that
01:45 - helps
01:45 - so one of the things i see people do is
01:47 - they're always super antsy right
01:49 - and they will i always laugh with um
01:52 - we have a team member on the team his
01:54 - name is david david ricosi shout out to
01:56 - david
01:56 - he's an absolute badass in every sense
01:59 - of the word let me just make sure the
02:01 - video is working
02:02 - great he's an absolute badass
02:05 - he is probably one of the fastest
02:07 - growing developer i've ever seen in my
02:09 - entire life
02:10 - and he got better because he is on the
02:12 - clever programmer team
02:13 - and when you work with me you work your
02:16 - ass off like we just work
02:18 -  extremely hard like it's
02:20 - memorial day today but we're working
02:21 - other people are taking days off
02:23 - and i don't even know how that
02:24 - works so um
02:28 - of course somebody's gonna complain
02:30 - about mental health in the chat
02:31 - and gonna be like oh mental health is
02:33 - super important
02:34 - i agree i never not once in my life said
02:38 - it's not important
02:39 - somebody like started making tick tocks
02:41 - and they're like he's saying
02:43 - mental health is not important
02:46 - said that zero times mental
02:48 - health is probably one of the most
02:50 - important things
02:52 - but also so is work ethic to become a
02:54 - great fighter you have to fight a lot
02:56 - to become a great developer you have to
02:58 - code and develop and think like a
03:00 - software developer a lot
03:01 - okay so i don't know there's some weird
03:04 -  that happens sometimes
03:05 - on youtube and on the internet but you
03:07 - know if you're my people you know what
03:09 - i'm talking about and everybody else
03:12 - you can go watch somebody else's video
03:13 - this is my platform so i'm going to say
03:14 - what i want to say
03:19 - so david improved so fast in coding
03:23 - he improved he's one of the fastest
03:24 - people to improve in his skill
03:26 - and the ability to put things together
03:28 - but one of the things that's funny with
03:30 - him sometimes
03:31 - is i laugh because he's
03:34 - so quick and he will get things and he
03:36 - will start working on them and start
03:38 - coding them up
03:39 - i always joke with him that even if you
03:42 - had a door that was right there
03:44 - instead of just opening the door and
03:47 - getting out of the house
03:49 - he will like go to the kitchen
03:52 - build a bazooka rocket launcher
03:55 - cook up some crazy
03:56 - come to the front of the door and like
03:58 - shoot the whole building down and then
03:59 - get out
04:00 - with explosions in the back his hair
04:02 - flying in the air and him just feeling
04:04 - like a badass
04:07 - the problem that happens with him
04:08 - sometimes is that he will
04:10 - over complicate things but his skill
04:13 - level is awesome you know he's so good
04:15 - so even when he over complicates
04:17 - oftentimes he gets away with it
04:19 - the other way i can put it to you is for
04:21 - example think of like coding like a
04:23 - like martial art right jiu jitsu in jiu
04:26 - jitsu a lot of jiu jitsu is about
04:28 - your skill that you develop the
04:30 - techniques that you develop
04:32 - so the point is that even if you're 150
04:34 - pounds
04:35 - and you fight against somebody who's 190
04:37 - but if you're really well trained and
04:39 - you have the skills and you're like a
04:40 - purple belt and they're like a white
04:42 - belt even if they're way stronger than
04:44 - you you're going to them up and
04:46 - win and that's because you have
04:49 - good techniques so with software
04:53 - development you have to have good
04:54 - technique
04:55 - just taking spaghetti and throwing it
04:56 - all over the wall oftentimes won't solve
04:58 - your problem sometimes
05:00 - even in jiu jitsu but if you have
05:01 - somebody who's 220 pounds they can out
05:03 - muscle you
05:04 - okay but just because they can
05:07 - they you know it doesn't mean they
05:09 - should and just because they're still
05:11 - good and surviving doesn't mean they
05:13 - can't get better
05:14 - so as a software developer who can do
05:16 - things in a complicated way and keep
05:18 - making progress
05:21 - it's not that you're not going to get
05:22 - very far it's that
05:24 - could you get even better if you got
05:27 - better
05:28 - at making things simple and simplifying
05:31 - everything in your mind
05:32 - okay and where that comes in
05:36 - right like david will smoke me in speed
05:38 - he will put things together like way
05:39 - faster
05:41 - but where sometimes it exposes it is
05:44 - when david and i are working
05:45 - i will actually just spend more time
05:47 - reading the documentation and just
05:49 - calmly
05:50 - sipping my coffee
05:53 - and thinking about the problem and
05:56 - actually
05:57 - sometimes even white boarding or
05:58 - planning it david will just like
06:01 - run in and like just the first thing
06:03 - he's just coding it up he's like yeah
06:05 - writing code he probably has like rock
06:07 - music going his like hair is blowing in
06:09 - here he's like
06:10 - yeah like coated up like just going
06:13 - crazy
06:14 - and we'll spend like four hours
06:18 - and i will find oh after a lot of
06:21 - research i found out there's just an api
06:23 - that like
06:24 - solves the thing that i'm trying to
06:25 - solve with like four lines of code
06:27 - david have will whipped up like 500
06:30 - lines of code
06:31 - two different projects one for the front
06:34 - end one for the back end
06:36 - and um he will then have to spend
06:40 - also another year of his life
06:43 - maintaining that
06:46 - so it doesn't mean one is better than
06:50 - the other
06:50 - because there are many times where we do
06:52 - need the bazooka approach and david will
06:53 - just get it done whereas somebody else
06:55 - is just like meandering and thinking
06:57 - david will always get it done so if you
06:59 - need somebody who gets it done that's
07:01 -  david
07:02 - which is important but my point to you
07:05 - is again and my point to david is
07:08 - could he get even better
07:11 - and sometimes working hard to simplify
07:14 - things can be huge
07:16 - because now think about it like this
07:17 - right let me start like breaking it down
07:20 - so let's go over to here
07:24 - if let's say
07:28 - um david is on left side
07:32 - okay and maybe i'm on the right hand
07:34 - side
07:38 - okay i don't know why i'm so small but
07:40 - that's fine david is really tall
07:42 - anyways he's like six something
07:45 - if he's building something sure the
07:48 - the time that it takes him to build it
07:52 - might be faster than than me so for
07:54 - example let's just go like this and
07:55 - let's just say
07:56 - david is like done right around here
08:02 - whereas
08:05 - um you know let's just say maybe it
08:07 - takes me like
08:10 - way longer like it takes me like this
08:12 - long
08:13 - okay but i was like reading the
08:15 - documentation i was reading up on the
08:17 - stripe docs
08:18 - i was reading up the difference between
08:20 - you know and stripes have something
08:22 - called like
08:23 - product versus order versus
08:27 - um it's so confusing like pricing
08:31 - versus subscription and you're just like
08:34 - what is the difference like so many of
08:36 - these things sound so similar and where
08:38 - do i use and
08:39 - a lot of it is really counterintuitive
08:41 - and confusing
08:43 - and it's just it's bizarre
08:46 - and let's say that we code up something
08:48 - okay and and it doesn't matter which way
08:50 - we do it but like
08:51 - here it happens right so now what he's
08:53 - done and he solved his problem and maybe
08:55 - it took him
08:56 - one hour okay and maybe i solved the
09:00 - problem
09:00 - and let's just say it took me two hours
09:03 - okay or let's make it even more let's
09:05 - say it took me three hours
09:08 - let's say david solution was custom
09:11 - coded oh
09:12 - my face i'll have to put it in the
09:14 - middle like this
09:16 - okay now let's say david solution was
09:19 - maybe
09:20 - fairly
09:23 - custom coded okay and me i
09:26 - found either a library or something that
09:29 - helps okay so maybe i found
09:31 - a existing solution
09:36 - okay so either i found an existing
09:38 - solution or i took an existing solution
09:40 - and molded it into
09:43 - the project that i was working okay
09:47 - david spent a ton of time on straight up
09:50 - coding
09:51 - for this i had to probably spend a ton
09:53 - of time
09:54 - researching learning stack overflowing
10:00 - etc okay
10:04 - now what happens did david's uh
10:08 - coding skills in that time frame
10:10 - improved for sure
10:11 - for sure he probably got much many more
10:14 - lines of coding experience
10:15 - he probably ran into many more technical
10:17 - coding errors
10:18 - so maybe he got better with using the
10:20 - use effect hook
10:22 - probably he got better with uh you know
10:25 - how react
10:25 - renders components how um to actually
10:29 - make the back end talk to the front end
10:31 - and there's some like
10:32 - errors that he's getting into so there's
10:33 - things where he's
10:35 - for sure improving in which are really
10:37 - important
10:38 - okay but now if you look at the overall
10:42 - thing of what's happening is now this
10:44 - custom coded solution that he had to do
10:46 - whereas i found an
10:48 - online resource or an api or an existing
10:51 - solution made it work
10:52 - here's what happens as time increase
10:55 - as time goes on okay now on david's end
11:00 - his time in maintaining it or coming
11:03 - back to it constantly to make it work
11:05 - and making sure
11:06 - his time will keep either linearly
11:08 - increasing or kind of like a hockey
11:09 - stick increasing but let's just say it
11:10 - kept
11:11 - increasing linearly over a course of a
11:13 - year
11:14 - okay and so now let's just say this is
11:17 - like
11:18 - maybe you know 100 hours
11:21 - okay or or let's just say it's like 30
11:24 - hours
11:25 - okay whereas maybe
11:28 - i found an online solution and so
11:31 - my time because those people that
11:34 - provided the solution or the api
11:36 - are doing the job of maintaining all of
11:38 - this so i don't have to worry about the
11:40 - infrastructure i don't have to worry
11:41 - about
11:42 - trying to scale it on cloud computing or
11:45 - anything like that
11:46 - i don't really have to worry about
11:47 - anything so my time
11:50 - grows very linearly very very small so
11:53 - like maybe in my one year i've probably
11:55 - spent a total of like
11:57 - 10 hours on this thing or less
12:01 - okay maybe even like let's just say
12:03 - eight
12:04 - okay but let's just say 10. okay so if
12:07 - we combine this
12:09 - all right 10 hours
12:13 - versus 30 hours
12:18 - okay so think about the total time
12:21 - total time now he might have spent
12:24 - 3x more time than um
12:28 - oh man i really have to really have to
12:31 - figure out
12:32 - where i belong because this is kind of
12:34 - crazy
12:36 - maybe there let's make me smaller
12:43 - okay that's that's a little bit better
12:46 - all right
12:48 - so he might have spent so he's probably
12:50 - spent like 3x
12:52 - my time right so that means i was 3x
12:56 - faster okay so let me go to i go over
12:59 - here
13:00 - 3x faster so what happens when you're 3x
13:04 - faster
13:07 - it's at the cost sometimes of being 3x
13:10 - slower right look at the start it took
13:13 - him one hour and took me three hours
13:15 - so i was actually much much much slower
13:18 - at the start
13:21 - but then as time progressed my thing
13:24 - just keeps getting faster and faster
13:28 - and i don't have to like use mental
13:30 - computation to keep this one thing up i
13:32 - can keep
13:33 - now working on newer and interesting
13:35 - problems where maybe
13:37 - he might have to keep on managing
13:40 - that infrastructure that he's built okay
13:43 - so going slow
13:50 - is going fast
13:55 - so this is one of the things i talk
13:56 - about very often in the world of
13:59 - software development going slow is
14:02 - the secret to going fast and sometimes
14:04 - it just looks like a boring day where
14:06 - you come in with your cup of
14:08 - coffee
14:09 - you're just chilling you're just reading
14:11 - the docs
14:12 - you're just having a great time you're
14:14 - relaxing
14:15 - you might feel like you're not doing
14:17 -  you might even feel like yo i'm not
14:18 - even coding like i should get
14:22 - you're doing a lot and even at a
14:24 - software developer real
14:25 - job a lot of your day is thinking a lot
14:29 - it's sitting there looking thinking
14:31 - coming up with ideas
14:33 - okay
14:37 - so it pays off in the long run and
14:39 - that's why sometimes when i see new
14:41 - developers and you're really hungry to
14:43 - sit there and code
14:45 - i am too i love it i want to get my
14:47 - hands dirty as fast as possible
14:49 - but remember your job is to solve
14:52 - problems when you write more code and
14:56 - you're like oh my cracker to code it up
14:58 - like
14:58 - just
15:04 - you are creating problems you're not
15:06 - solving problems
15:08 - the more lines of code you write the
15:10 - more
15:11 - chances of having bugs you introduced
15:14 - into the world
15:16 - when i want to work on a chess project
15:19 - the last thing i probably want to
15:20 -  do
15:21 - is to think of a solution to come up
15:23 - with it
15:25 - the first thing i want to do is like
15:28 - senior software developers what's
15:30 - amazing about them
15:30 - is they think so little the more you
15:33 - code the more you realize how important
15:35 - thinking is and you almost never want to
15:37 - have to think
15:38 - until it's time you don't want to have
15:41 - to think about any problem that's either
15:43 - solved or solvable
15:45 - or you can kind of take it from
15:47 - somewhere plug it in and go
15:49 - i don't want to have to think about
15:51 - authentication
15:52 - okay it's an already solved problem it
15:55 - will do nothing to my life if i figured
15:57 - it out and how to write it from scratch
15:59 - i just borrow boilerplate
16:03 - code from github i give them
16:06 - credit and boom my authentication is up
16:09 - and running with firebase
16:11 - i don't want to figure out how to add in
16:14 - social authentication of
16:16 - google facebook it's already figured out
16:20 - but if i'm coming up with an idea for a
16:22 - new app
16:23 - like when i'm working on my own youtube
16:25 - app and i'm trying to figure out how to
16:26 - make commissions for the people who are
16:28 - making content on my youtube channel
16:30 - and pull in all that data or if we have
16:32 - sales calls pull in data from calendly
16:34 - and show it in a specific way and push
16:36 - notifications and
16:38 - now it's fascinating now i'm entering a
16:40 - world of new problems so now i'm going
16:42 - to think about solving those problems
16:44 - now the clock of thinking begins
16:47 - try not to use it on everything that's
16:50 - out there you're gonna drive yourself
16:51 - crazy
16:53 - going slow is going fast that's one key
16:56 - thing
16:56 - how software developers think
16:59 - i want you guys to start understanding
17:02 - how to think like a software developer
17:04 - because that's going to be one of the
17:06 - most powerful things and if you're one
17:07 - of the boot camp students
17:09 - it's going to be even more important for
17:11 - you to know all this
17:16 - okay shout out to the full stack mastery
17:18 - boot camp fam
17:20 - i think we're up to almost 25 to 30
17:23 - students uh for the june cohort
17:26 - we had martin get incredible results
17:29 - which was freaking awesome martin just
17:30 - got a job
17:32 - recently we had on get a job from post
17:34 - mates who
17:35 - um he got a job with uh
17:38 - gravity i forgot payment gravity payment
17:40 - something like that if somebody could
17:41 - look that up and drop in
17:43 - in the comments what the actual company
17:44 - is called um i've
17:46 - slipped the name sometimes but he got a
17:48 - full stack developer job
17:50 - and then we had dave lueck shout out to
17:52 - dave lueck
17:53 - he just joined our boot camp and in 10
17:56 - days he got a job offer
17:58 - granted granted he already had
18:00 - experience with coding
18:01 - okay so he didn't come into our full
18:03 - stack mastery boot camp
18:05 - completely with your experience he came
18:07 - in with a little bit of experience
18:09 - but he did say and i quote um
18:14 - the within the first 10 days the
18:16 - recursion that he learned
18:18 - because here's what happened right he
18:19 - went to his job interview and they asked
18:21 - him to write
18:22 - fibonacci sequence recursively and he
18:25 - goes
18:26 - because i learned that that was the
18:28 - first thing i learned within the first
18:30 - 10 days of the boot camp
18:31 - that was the thing that i solved in the
18:34 - interview and that's what led
18:35 - me to getting the job so had he not done
18:38 - that
18:38 - he would not be getting that job because
18:40 - of a fibonacci sequence i know it's
18:42 - stupid i know this shouldn't be having
18:43 - you guys do these arcade
18:45 - wide boarding problems i don't even
18:47 - remember how to do it from scratch right
18:49 - this second i'll have to
18:50 - actually think about that it's unfair
18:52 - because it's not really how you're doing
18:54 - most of your full stack development
18:56 - but you have to play the game if you
18:58 - want to get those jobs if you want to
19:00 - get those six figure jobs okay so
19:02 - shout out dave if you're here or in the
19:04 - video drop a comment on this video and i
19:06 - will make sure to pin it
19:08 - but i love our students in the boot camp
19:10 - they're crushing it
19:12 - joshua another student loved this guy
19:16 - um he was joshua was going to
19:20 - lambda school and full stack mastery
19:21 - boot camp at the same time
19:23 - and then joshua started going josh
19:26 - i don't know if i can say this but
19:28 - whatever i'm gonna say
19:29 - but you kind of stopped doing lambda and
19:32 - you started going all
19:33 - into full stack mastery boot camp and
19:35 - now joshua is on a job hunt
19:37 - okay so i'll keep you guys updated on
19:38 - how his job hunt goes
19:41 - which is super exciting um you guys
19:44 - should root for him because right now
19:45 - he's going through the job phase and
19:46 - sometimes he gets a little nervous and
19:48 - stuff so we have to be there to kick him
19:49 - in the ass and also
19:51 - um help him but again guys
19:54 - these are the things that make you a
19:56 - software developer the willingness to
19:58 - keep grinding the willingness to
20:00 - keep pushing through regardless of what
20:02 - comes in your way
20:04 - and though one of the things that we
20:06 - work on with our students in our boot
20:07 - camp
20:09 - tons of problem solving and thinking
20:12 - they're doing
20:13 - so much of that on a regular basis
20:17 - so freaking much of that okay because
20:20 - without
20:21 - learning how to think like a software
20:24 - developer without having the discipline
20:25 - to
20:26 - not touch the keyboard every second you
20:29 - get a chance and like
20:30 - read documentation and get better you
20:33 - will not get better
20:34 - okay so going back to this if you're
20:37 - improving at a 3x rate because you're
20:39 - going slower in the start
20:41 - this is also why i say masters the
20:43 - master the basics
20:44 - because here's what the life trajectory
20:46 - then looks like okay of you as a
20:48 - software developer in your career
20:51 - okay your trajectory
20:55 - will look like this okay
20:59 - somebody else who just sits there and
21:00 - codes their trajectory looks like this
21:05 - okay so that hockey stick growth
21:08 - that's what you want you don't want to
21:11 - be the person that just sits there and
21:13 - code
21:13 - mindlessly all the time you want
21:16 - to
21:17 - think okay this is the other guy
21:22 - hmm man david i feel bad i hope you
21:25 - don't get offended by this david is
21:27 - freaking awesome okay david is not on
21:29 - that linear trajectory this guy has had
21:31 - the most exponential growth and he kicks
21:32 - my ass
21:33 - in terms of how much he picked up in one
21:35 - year okay and oftentimes i even go to
21:36 - him to ask him questions so
21:38 - i just want to make sure david don't be
21:40 - upset about this we love you i love you
21:42 - you're an awesome person i was just
21:44 - using this as an example okay
21:45 - we love you but this is the trajectory
21:49 - you want
21:49 - and so what happens then is you're
21:52 - getting
21:53 - three times the results of somebody's
21:55 - entire career
21:56 - or more in just your one career as a
21:59 - software developer
22:01 - and it's not just a multiplicative
22:02 - effect guys it's an exponential
22:05 - effect you're not just better by
22:07 - multiplied by something you're
22:09 - exponentially you start growing faster
22:10 - than the other person okay
22:12 - but this is where you have to suffer in
22:14 - the start and be okay with that
22:16 - because these other people are just
22:17 - coding they're like yeah i'm working on
22:18 - node.js now now i'm learning apis now
22:20 - i'm learning this
22:22 - you're like okay i'm going pretty slow
22:24 - i'm going pretty slow i'm working
22:26 - on i'm working on like my basics
22:29 - i'm working on problem solving i'm
22:32 - working on
22:33 - data structures i'm working on
22:37 - mastering arrays i'm working on
22:39 - mastering loops
22:41 - i'm working on mastering if then
22:42 - statements i'm making basic games really
22:45 - well like tic-tac-toe
22:47 - i'm able to code from scratch so like
22:50 - these little tiny things is what you're
22:52 - doing in that time
22:54 - where the other person is like i just
22:55 - learned next gs
22:57 - now i'm doing tailwind css now i'm doing
23:01 - and you'll feel like you're so behind
23:03 - them and you'll feel like man these guys
23:04 - just know everything i know nothing
23:06 - but trust me it's that slow jack
23:10 - turtle pace it's where you're getting
23:12 - the basics right
23:15 - even in boxing the basics are
23:17 - what's
23:18 - in boxing there's one two one two
23:22 - you can be practicing your one two for a
23:25 - year and not get it right for a decade
23:27 - and still be learning
23:29 - okay so just mastering when i hit that
23:32 - two how am i gonna move
23:33 - okay oh i'm dropping my hands basic
23:36 -  you'll be like oh yeah it makes
23:37 - sense but then when you're actually out
23:39 - there fighting you'll drop your hands
23:41 - you'll get knocked out
23:42 - right done so you want to bring that
23:46 - mindset to this where you want to get
23:48 - your basics so
23:49 - solid that you keep building on top of
23:52 - it
23:52 - rather than oh i learned python this
23:56 - week
23:56 - now i learned this other thing yeah now
23:58 - i'm gonna learn go
24:00 - cool get the basics right then do all of
24:03 - this
24:03 - but your career i want you to be
24:05 - increasing at this
24:06 - pace that i'm showing here all right and
24:09 - in the start that looks slow
24:11 - and it looks like frustrating but then
24:14 - the difference becomes
24:16 - massive over time okay
24:19 - so in order to think like a software
24:21 - developer
24:22 - in order to do that you need to be okay
24:26 - with going slow
24:27 - it will lead to imposter syndrome and
24:29 - you will think that you don't know what
24:31 - the hell you're talking
24:32 - about what you're doing you'll feel slow
24:33 - and that's okay
24:35 - you'll need to give up a lot of ego and
24:37 - pride and when your friend is sitting
24:39 - next to you and it's like i just
24:41 - made this clone and you're like
24:44 - cool i just practiced
24:48 - 20 loop array problems and he'll be like
24:52 - yeah my portfolio is sick you're like
24:55 - nice great job keep going awesome i'm
24:58 - happy for you
24:58 - you got this you'll kick ass
25:02 - and you're just quietly chugging along
25:06 - your friend will be like i just built
25:08 - the amazon clone with cause he was
25:10 - amazing
25:11 - it and that is cool and i'm sure it
25:14 - helps in certain ways
25:15 - but you're like okay i did like
25:18 - five um if then statement problems
25:22 - it's okay when you get so good at that
25:25 - you just become such an effective code
25:27 - like at writing code and even now when i
25:30 - think of myself when
25:31 - i'm like writing code there's so many
25:33 - times world i'll have
25:35 - all this complex stuff that i have to do
25:38 - where another software developer will
25:39 - write it in like 40 lines or 30 lines
25:42 - because my basics are so strong i'll
25:44 - write that same thing in one to two
25:46 - lines
25:47 - and i'm just at ease and i feel calm and
25:49 - i'm just
25:51 - that's okay but it's because i worked
25:54 - so freaking much to just keep working on
25:56 - the basics basics basics basic space
25:59 - and just keep working on it for the
26:00 - longest amount of time okay
26:02 - so that's all i gotta say to you um
26:05 - get your mind right work on going slow
26:08 - now
26:09 - that's what's going fast have a lot of
26:11 - patience
26:12 - and become that developer that grow um
26:15 - is at 3x pace okay
26:18 - maybe i'll title this video david versus
26:19 - the gala

27:35 - help and improve faster rather than like
27:37 - going in freaking circles for the
27:39 - longest amount of time because that's
27:40 - what happened with me right
27:42 - i joined um i was doing mma for like two
27:45 - years
27:46 - and i barely saw any improvement now
27:49 - i'm working with miguel two months in
27:51 - i'm training with him and he's been
27:53 - fighting since he was seven years old
27:55 - he's like black belt in almost every
27:57 - single
27:58 - um every single type of sport and
28:02 - he's just um he's incredible i
28:05 - think he's
28:05 - purple belt in jiu jitsu but he kills it
28:08 - in kickboxing boxing been doing it
28:10 - and he's friends with brian ortega and
28:12 - all these people that are actual ufc
28:14 - fighters
28:15 - and he was even fighting in um
28:18 - i forget where he was fighting but he
28:19 - was actually in a ufc cage fighting
28:22 - so when i started learning from miguel
28:26 - my skills just started flying because
28:30 - i was gonna spend a year or two years
28:32 - doing
28:33 - stupid one-two combos and he just fixed
28:36 - it right away for me
28:37 - he fixed how do i shoot when i go for a
28:40 - wrestling takedown
28:41 - how do i do a single leg how do i do a
28:43 - double leg how do i go and switch into
28:45 - side mount how do i switch into full
28:47 - mount how do i transition
28:48 - out of somebody's full guard break out
28:51 - of it
28:52 - you know how how how do i get somebody's
28:55 - back
28:56 - how do i do a guillotine how do i do a
28:58 - rear naked choke how do i do an arm bar
29:00 - all those things you just and i'm
29:03 - getting good
29:04 - so freaking fast at 145 pounds i'm able
29:07 - to fight with
29:08 - friends who are like 200 pounds and
29:09 - strong as
29:12 - so that's what happens right you improve
29:14 - fast so if you want to improve that fast
29:16 - and get those types of results
29:18 - go get help i don't care if it's with us
29:20 - go get help from somewhere else
29:21 - but if you care about time
29:24 - improve i'm paying 175 dollars
29:28 - per session that i have with my coach
29:31 - because he's one of the best in the
29:32 - world
29:33 - i'm not saying you have to pay that much
29:35 - where you're learning from but
29:38 - invest and that gives you time faster it
29:40 - gives you your time back
29:42 - okay so i want you to have your freaking
29:44 - time back i don't want you to just be
29:46 - like
29:46 - oh i'm gonna just let me
29:49 - see where i can get the cheapest help
29:51 - because you're gonna get the cheapest
29:52 - results
29:53 - all right that's how i'm able to improve
29:56 - so fast in the things that i do
29:58 - because i'm like okay let me just keep
30:00 - putting an amazing team around me even
30:02 - when i was learning coding and software
30:03 - development
30:04 - every time i would make seventy dollars
30:06 - or fifty dollars an hour i would just
30:08 - hire a coach from codementor and pay
30:10 - them seventy dollars an hour and just
30:12 - learn from them
30:13 - i'm like i'm okay with having zero money
30:16 - left over or
30:17 - very little money left over as long as
30:19 - of course i can pay my rent and things
30:20 - like that but at that time i was living
30:22 - with my parents
30:23 - so i was okay with leaving zero money
30:25 - behind because i knew
30:27 - the game was just skill so if i could sk
30:30 - improve my skill fast
30:34 - then that's it then i'm good
30:37 - because
30:38 - if i have the skill of making seventy
30:40 - dollars an hour then i can always get a
30:41 - job they'll pay me seventy dollars an
30:43 - hour
30:43 - if i get the skill of making 120 an hour
30:45 - because i'm such a good software
30:47 - developer
30:47 - worked on my negotiation skills
30:49 - interviewing skills
30:50 - problem-solving skills algorithm skills
30:52 - data structure skills
30:54 - back-end skills front-end skills and now
30:57 - i have permanently skill of making 130
30:59 - an hour and what that basically turns
31:01 - out to is a
31:03 - high five figure eighty thousand ninety
31:05 - thousand dollar a year job or maybe even
31:06 - a hundred forty hundred fifty thousand
31:08 - dollar a year job
31:11 - right so that's how these things help
31:14 - you grow now we have a multi-million
31:15 - dollar business
31:17 - because we help people learn these
31:19 - skills and get there faster so when they
31:21 - get results the business gets results
31:23 - and it's a
