00:00 - hey you what's up this is kanji from
00:02 - clever programmer calm and in this video
00:04 - I want to answer two really cool
00:06 - questions for you guys the first one I'm
00:08 - going to keep it relevant and it's about
00:10 - how do I practice coding in the best way
00:14 - by Chris gamer and then we have a second
00:18 - question which is do I have any other
00:21 - chat channels or whatever so I'm going
00:24 - to answer both of those questions for
00:26 - you guys
00:27 - there going to be a lot of fun and let's
00:29 - jump right into it so the best way to
00:44 - practice coding if I'm going to be
00:47 - honest with you guys
00:48 - I am going to say that you definitely
00:51 - want to spend as much time as possible
00:53 - but I want to be respectful of your
00:55 - constraints because you might be working
00:59 - already at a job or you might have no
01:02 - jobs so now you have time or you might
01:06 - be at school college student or a high
01:09 - school student or middle school or
01:11 - whatever so if that's the case which was
01:14 - the case for me any extra time that I
01:17 - would have I would spend in coding but
01:19 - let's say if I have time where college
01:22 - was off then I would just spend full
01:24 - time in programming and in coding and
01:27 - this question also ties in with one of
01:29 - the previous questions of apps - I live
01:32 - my life cause II do I have spend time
01:35 - with friends or do I choose coding and
01:38 - how I entered him was you don't have to
01:40 - pick one or the other you can kind of
01:43 - combine the two which is what I did and
01:45 - I had my friends kind of start day they
01:48 - were coding and so we kind of did that
01:51 - together and so we got to spend time
01:53 - hang out but then we also got to spend
01:56 - time coding so it was like a double
01:57 - whammy so that's something I would say
02:00 - for you now the best actual way to
02:02 - practice coding I mean it's the question
02:04 - is a little vague in that sense but the
02:07 - most important thing again is time and
02:10 - then resources so a lot of people stick
02:13 - just academic resource and they treat
02:16 - like college high school or whatever
02:17 - it's just the only resource I want you
02:20 - to think of your school as only one
02:23 - resource out of the many resources you
02:25 - can use so don't be dependent on oh I
02:28 - haven't got a new homework yet so I
02:29 - guess I'm all caught up like in the
02:32 - meantime go online look at some other
02:35 - resources have at least five six seven
02:37 - different resources that connect fast
02:39 - with you
02:40 - Udacity course connects best with you
02:42 - jump into the Udacity course Coursera
02:45 - course connects best with you jump into
02:47 - the course air of course my course at
02:49 - clever programmer connects the best with
02:50 - you jump into my course anywhere that
02:53 - offers you the best value and that you
02:55 - can connect with jump into those courses
02:58 - you don't have anything to lose and if
03:00 - you have multiple resources you can pick
03:02 - and choose so one of them is not working
03:05 - for you you can pick the other that's
03:06 - always cool and you never essentially
03:09 - run out of homework okay and your
03:12 - ultimate homework is basically trying to
03:14 - build projects so the best way to learn
03:16 - coding is have multiple resources work
03:18 - on projects and involve your friends or
03:21 - make friends in the circle of coding and
03:24 - that's how I would answer that question
03:25 - Chris gamer hopefully I nailed that one
03:29 - for you moving on to the second question
03:31 - do I have any other chess channels I've
03:33 - been getting a lot of chess interest
03:36 - because I'm interested in chess I love
03:38 - chess so you guys see that and some of
03:40 - you who are interested in it that's one
03:42 - of the freaking will frequently asked
03:44 - questions I get so I'm going to just
03:46 - take the liberty to answer it yes I do
03:48 - it's called chess tastic it's been dead
03:51 - it's super high-quality channel but back
03:55 - in those days I wasn't so good with my
03:57 - youtubing and I wasn't consistent and
03:59 - like what I thought was going to be
04:01 - great with I just made a bunch of videos
04:02 - and then just publish them on the same
04:05 - date which is a terrible idea
04:07 - you should publish it on a consistent
04:08 - schedule consistency beats anything on
04:12 - YouTube or in any type of business and
04:16 - yeah I even have a website called chest
04:18 - tastic Tom so I guess for you guys go
04:22 - watch those videos on YouTube I think
04:24 - they're really awesome there
04:26 - like one of the highest quality videos
04:29 - on chess and especially for beginners
04:31 - and then I play a few games there so you
04:34 - can pick up some coding chops and in my
04:36 - learn Python Opie course we are actually
04:39 - going to be building a chess app so it's
04:42 - going to be a desktop app it's going to
04:43 - be local and you're going to be able to
04:45 - play with a friend and a full graphical
04:47 - user interface using Python because I
04:51 - love chess and I found a way to combine
04:53 - my passion my love for chess people who
04:56 - play table tennis those pawns using
04:58 - Python right so it's really up to your
05:01 - creativity and how you mix your passion
05:04 - and hobbies and your work together okay
05:08 - that way you can practice coding in the
05:11 - best way that way you can learn chess or
05:13 - whatever else thing that you love to do
05:16 - and combine it with programming
05:18 - hopefully that answers your guys's
05:21 - questions this is ask
05:23 - Kazi ask your question below hashtag ask
05:26 - Ozzy and if it's good enough I'm going
05:28 - to jump in and answer it for you all
05:30 - right that's it I love you guys so much
05:32 - and I'll see you in the next video
