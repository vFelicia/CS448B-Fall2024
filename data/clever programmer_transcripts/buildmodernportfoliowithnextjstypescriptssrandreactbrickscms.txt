00:15 - to teach you a lot of new things you
00:17 - never knew existed this portfolio is
00:19 - going to have it all it's going to be
00:21 - powered by next.js you're going to have
00:23 - server side rendering along with the
00:25 - power of typescript you're also going to
00:27 - have tailwind css for your styling
00:29 - you're going to have a content
00:30 - management system you're going to have
00:32 - react stories so you can actually see
00:34 - every single one of your components in a
00:36 - playground play with it test it tweak it
00:38 - change it and do whatever you want

00:43 - to have full seo capabilities you're
00:45 - going to have an admin interface and
00:48 - you're going to have a full backend
00:49 - where all this data is stored it's going
00:51 - to blow your mind how simple this app is
00:53 - going to be and you're going to have
00:54 - this app up and running in maybe 20 to
00:56 - 30 minutes or less i promise you that
00:59 - this is one of the best and most
01:00 - creative solutions i've ever seen to
01:02 - this nobody's ever talking about it and
01:04 - i really want to show you how to do this
01:06 - with next let's go
01:08 - if you want to watch this the first
01:09 - price you have to pay it's like a toll

01:20 - not like it i love your beautiful face
01:21 - anyway with that said here's what i want
01:24 - you to do if you want to code this along
01:25 - with me grab that rebel fork it
01:29 - why because we're going to give you all
01:31 - the assets the images and everything
01:32 - that you'll need access to and it'll
01:34 - also set up next.js out of the box for
01:37 - you so just make sure go in the
01:38 - description click that rapple link it's
01:40 - going to say join.replay.com
01:43 - cp
01:44 - portfolio
01:45 - click that fork it you'll get all the
01:47 - assets and then you can actually code
01:50 - along with me right in your browser and
01:52 - it has javascript and nexus and
01:54 - everything is powered by replit so let's
01:56 - go all right once you hit that link it's
01:59 - going to bring you to this page right
02:00 - over here just make sure you hit fork
02:03 - and once you hit fork it will actually
02:04 - allow you to edit this code and do
02:06 - whatever you want with it so let's hit
02:08 - fork right now all right now that we've
02:10 - forked this okay you could see it says
02:12 - fork this blah blah and then it says
02:14 - dash one at the end okay which means now
02:17 - i can i should be able to write my own
02:18 - code in here if i want perfect you
02:21 - should also have this assets file and
02:22 - this assets file will have some images
02:24 - that we will need for this portfolio
02:27 - and stuff like that okay
02:29 - now let's just walk through this
02:30 - portfolio together see boom you go in
02:33 - rafael full stack developer i like to
02:36 - build amazing ui ux experiences right
02:39 - you got the testimonial segment right
02:41 - here which looks really slick and
02:43 - powerful introduction to who you are
02:45 - this will be very important if you're
02:47 - trying to represent yourself as a
02:49 - developer you want to tell them who you
02:51 - are
02:52 - you want to tell them about a little bit
02:54 - of your personal life as well i only
02:56 - have one sentence here so it's not too
02:57 - much right and then i go hey here are my
02:59 - preferred weapons of choice these are
03:01 - the things that i like to code with
03:02 - whatever so now they instantly know
03:04 - about you you can click my github takes
03:07 - you there so we're just going to do a
03:09 - walkthrough and an overview of all of
03:11 - this and how this actually is working
03:14 - now keep in mind all of this is next
03:16 - type script there's server side
03:18 - rendering which is why it's so fast this
03:20 - is currently deployed online already on
03:23 - digitalocean so you'll learn how to do
03:24 - that as well with and i'm going to show
03:26 - you one last part which is going to blow
03:28 - your freaking mind okay so we're going
03:29 - to show you that
03:30 - now i can go here and it says hey here's
03:33 - my coding projects and it highlights all
03:36 - your coding projects
03:37 - and the reason i wanted to make it like
03:39 - this is so you could show off what stack
03:43 - or tech you're using for this
03:45 - along with a description of your project
03:47 - and what your project actually was
03:50 - and then you can link them to the demo
03:51 - so they can actually click and then go
03:54 - ahead and just view your app or they can
03:56 - hit the github repo
03:58 - and it'll take them to the repo because
04:00 - it's very important because if
04:01 - somebody's coming to your thing they
04:03 - want to be able to do both and vue demo
04:05 - is a more important one here's another
04:07 - app that they could view demo or like
04:09 - check out the repo here's another app
04:12 - that they could check out or repo and
04:14 - this is a portfolio you're going to be
04:15 - ending with after this tutorial is done
04:18 - it'll walk you through my experience
04:20 - section for anybody that's viewing it so
04:22 - i'll walk through
04:23 - where did you work how long did you work
04:26 - walk through that and it's very simple
04:28 - and sleek that's what i love about it
04:31 - and then here we also have your
04:32 - testimonial section so this is where
04:34 - you're going to put your testimonial
04:35 - section
04:36 - and then lastly a call to action so this
04:39 - part is very important for a call to
04:41 - action right my linkedin hey want me to
04:43 - build stuff for you
04:45 - now
04:46 - another cool part about this
04:48 - portfolio is it is a 100 mobile friendly
04:52 - so not all tutorials out there
04:55 - are mobile friendly but this one is if
04:57 - you view it on your phone it looks
04:59 - gorgeous and it doesn't matter how small
05:02 - you make it or how large you make it
05:04 - it knows exactly what to do
05:06 - and here is the best part
05:08 - you can just edit it look at that i can
05:10 - just point and click and edit
05:12 - i can just point and click and edit look
05:14 - at that so how the heck am i doing then
05:17 - this again is the next app it's not wix
05:19 - this is not squarespace i'm point and
05:22 - clicking and updating my app i can
05:24 - update the image
05:25 - right all of this update any of these
05:28 - images
05:29 - so
05:30 - how do you build an app that can do this
05:32 - and how do you build a portfolio that
05:33 - can do this this is going to be super
05:35 - impressive not only for yourself and
05:36 - you're going to enjoy it but for anybody
05:38 - that you actually show this to
05:40 - so i'm excited for you but with that
05:42 - said let's actually jump in and start
05:45 - coding this bad boy up now i want to
05:47 - show you a little bit more of the demo
05:49 - of this right so it's so easy to add
05:52 - things to this i just hit this plus
05:54 - button right over here and boom i can
05:56 - add whichever new section i want i can
05:59 - add this if i wanted this to go up i can
06:02 - move this section up i can start writing
06:04 - in here if i want to remove a button i
06:06 - can remove it i want to change the text
06:08 - of the button i can change it i can make
06:09 - it go full width
06:11 - now here's another cool part
06:13 - in react you have these stories right
06:16 - react stories is this very popular
06:17 - library a lot of people use you also get
06:20 - that built in so take a look at this
06:22 - right all of these units there's story
06:25 - right there
06:26 - and you can see your components by
06:28 - themselves and again this is all react
06:30 - this is not anything else you can see
06:32 - these components right over here okay
06:34 - and then these components let you add
06:35 - things or remove things if i want to add
06:37 - a feature do whatever i want so this
06:39 - playground lets you play with your
06:41 - components you can custom code them up
06:44 - some of them already come a lot of these
06:46 - actually come built in and i'll show you
06:48 - how these come built in
06:50 - and then some of these you could build
06:51 - yourself like your custom ones
06:53 - and
06:54 - this is super easy to actually do as
06:56 - well
06:57 - so
06:58 - this is unbelievable i wish somebody
07:00 - told me about a resource like this when
07:02 - i was building my applications because
07:04 - front end it makes your life so simple
07:06 - you could still code as much as you want
07:09 - custom and you could use all the power
07:11 - of react and next and
07:13 - use apis and integrate a database and
07:15 - all of that but content management just
07:18 - being baked in and being given to you
07:20 - out of the box is very very powerful
07:23 - so now let's go ahead and code this up
07:27 - all right so we're gonna have you sign
07:28 - up for digitalocean and here's what you
07:30 - want to do you want to click the link
07:32 - that i have in the description
07:34 - below
07:35 - or you can just go to it and it's
07:37 - try.digitalocean.comcleverprogrammer
07:40 - they've created a special landing page
07:43 - just for us so if you sign up from here
07:45 - you're actually going to get a hundred
07:47 - dollars of credit for 60 days and it's
07:49 - going to be a free trial so all you're
07:51 - going to do here is just pop in your
07:53 - email okay or
07:54 - just hit one of these sign up with
07:57 - google or github okay and again it's a
08:00 - 100 special so that means that when
08:02 - you're building this app you get to
08:04 - build it with me for free and then it
08:06 - should bring you to this page over here
08:09 - checking for bots apparently i'm not a
08:11 - bot
08:12 - so just take a look at this right this
08:14 - is just to verify that you're an actual
08:17 - real person
08:18 - so just go ahead and add a card okay you
08:21 - could do it with google pay or whichever
08:24 - one since i have some of my information
08:26 - google pay i'll just do it google pay
08:28 - all right so i just went ahead and added
08:30 - a card manually and now we're on this
08:32 - registration page
08:34 - cool and we don't really need to do
08:36 - anything here we could click deploy a
08:38 - web application okay and boom we'll just
08:41 - click that
08:42 - all right it should bring us into this
08:44 - and you can just leave this as is we
08:46 - don't need to touch this anymore until
08:48 - the very very end okay that's what we're
08:50 - going to be deploying so i'm just going
08:52 - to go all the way back
08:54 - to where we were starting to code
08:56 - now in order to get started one of the
08:59 - first things that we'll actually have to
09:01 - do
09:02 - is we'll have to install a couple of
09:05 - libraries okay so let's go ahead and do
09:07 - that now all right now the first thing
09:09 - we'll have to do is we'll have to
09:11 - get r next setup and we'll have to get
09:14 - this amazing library that actually does
09:17 - all of the heavy lifting for us it's
09:20 - called react bricks so let's go to react
09:23 - bricks and let's get that set up okay
09:26 - this is mind blowing react brix is
09:28 - actually what allows for visual content
09:31 - editing
09:32 - and it's just an amazing piece of
09:34 - software that i've discovered and over
09:36 - 2500 companies are using it so you can
09:38 - see it's pretty stable and a lot of
09:40 - companies are using it
09:41 - now to install it it's
09:43 - this easy
09:45 - all right that easy so we're just going
09:47 - to copy that
09:48 - npx create
09:50 - react bricks app so let's copy that
09:52 - let's go back to our command line and in
09:54 - our shell i'm just going to go ahead and
09:56 - paste that
09:58 - all right now let's go ahead and hit
10:00 - enter now starting to ask us some
10:01 - questions you want to proceed yes we
10:04 - want to proceed
10:05 - all right now as the installation
10:07 - process continues
10:10 - is going to install
10:12 - next this is going to install
10:14 - tailwind css this is going to get
10:17 - typescript set up and ready to go this
10:19 - will have everything all in place the
10:22 - code that it will generate will also
10:24 - come with server side rendering
10:27 - so again all of the heavy lifting is
10:30 - already done this is amazing now if you
10:33 - get this error right here which is hey
10:35 - please tell me who you are you could
10:37 - simply just copy this line right here
10:40 - paste it
10:41 - i'm gonna hide myself real quick
10:43 - and you can paste that line that we
10:45 - copied from here and then we're just
10:47 - going to put our email in quotes like
10:49 - this so we'll just say
10:51 - like that
10:52 - and copy this other line as well with
10:54 - the username
10:56 - paste it
10:57 - and we will put our name like this okay
11:00 - let's hit enter
11:01 - and now let's try installing
11:04 - react bricks again so i'm going to hit
11:07 - install
11:08 - and it says do you already have a react
11:10 - bricks account
11:11 - let we're just going to go ahead and say
11:14 - no that we don't okay so i'll write an n
11:17 - you should you can create an account
11:19 - before this that's really up to you okay
11:21 - so if you don't have an account this is
11:23 - not gonna go and go forward okay so make
11:26 - sure that you go ahead and create an
11:28 - account so i already have an account
11:30 - okay so on react breaks all you have to
11:32 - do is go here
11:34 - try for free
11:36 - doesn't ask you for a credit card or
11:38 - anything right put in a password i'll
11:40 - just say fake i've already created an
11:42 - account already with them so i don't
11:44 - need to create one from scratch
11:46 - and then there you go all right this
11:48 - will actually
11:49 - bring you right in okay so i have an
11:51 - account with them already so i'm going
11:54 - to go ahead
11:55 - and
11:56 - run that command again npx create react
12:00 - bricks app and i'm going to say yes i do
12:03 - have an account so i'm simply just going
12:04 - to hit enter here
12:06 - it's going to say please enter your
12:08 - react bricks account email so i will
12:10 - enter that email just like that
12:13 - it will ask me for the password
12:15 - hopefully i remember the password
12:17 - fingers crossed boom there we go
12:20 - and i'm gonna go ahead and create a new
12:22 - app okay and it's gonna say hey what's
12:24 - the app name
12:25 - and i'll say portfolio youtube
12:28 - app okay so that's gonna be the app name
12:31 - pick the default package name as well so
12:33 - i'm just gonna hit enter for the package
12:35 - name so let's hit enter and wait okay
12:38 - folder name yep just pick the default
12:40 - folder name and then we don't need to
12:43 - start with an empty project you could if
12:46 - you want we want to start with a website
12:48 - and blog with tailwind so it already
12:50 - comes with stuff it says hey which
12:52 - framework do you want
12:54 - we want to go ahead and choose
12:57 - next
12:58 - as our framework so i'm going to go
12:59 - ahead and hit hit enter on that
13:02 - and let's see what happens okay is it
13:04 - loading yup
13:06 - and then it goes do you want to load
13:08 - default content we'll just say yes load
13:11 - default content and now it's just going
13:13 - to take some time and it's going to
13:14 - download the starter package it's going
13:16 - to set up all the configurations it will
13:19 - set up all the app credentials for you
13:21 - it will install all the dependencies and
13:22 - it will set up even a git repo for you
13:25 - that you could use so now it's going to
13:27 - go ahead and do those things and as soon
13:29 - as it's done we're going to continue
13:31 - making progress on this app now this is
13:33 - taking a little bit or a couple of
13:36 - minutes to install don't worry
13:38 - there are a couple of things that we'll
13:40 - need to install and set up as
13:41 - dependencies so don't freak out nothing
13:43 - to worry about just let it take its time
13:46 - and then once it's set up you're gonna
13:48 - be ready to go
13:49 - all right there we go so now our app has
13:52 - completely finished installing it's
13:54 - ready to go so i'm gonna bring myself
13:57 - i'm gonna leave myself out of it or just
13:59 - move myself up a little bit so you can
14:01 - see my commands that i'm going to be
14:02 - writing but all we need to do here is
14:05 - simply go ahead and do cd
14:07 - and we need to go this was the folder
14:09 - that this app is installing reactbricks
14:11 - created portfolio yt app
14:14 - and if i go inside of this it has set me
14:16 - up with all of these files okay this is
14:19 - the entire structure it set me up now
14:22 - i need to cd into that and then go ahead
14:24 - and do yarn dev so let's cd into
14:26 - portfolio
14:27 - app and then let's go ahead and do yarn
14:30 - dev and let's see what we get so i've
14:32 - done yarn dev
14:34 - it looks like something is opening up
14:36 - fingers crossed
14:38 - and i'm gonna hit this url right over
14:40 - here so it can open
14:42 - it can open this in a new
14:44 - tab
14:45 - okay so once the app is loaded it'll
14:49 - show up there
14:50 - all right so if you get this error right
14:52 - here this is totally normal it's just
14:54 - saying hey you don't have a home page so
14:56 - we're gonna go ahead and click edit
14:58 - content
14:59 - and edit content should bring you to
15:01 - this page that says slash admin at the
15:04 - end of it okay and then once you're
15:06 - there we can go ahead and fix this
15:09 - problem it'll bring you to this page so
15:11 - go ahead and sign in i'm gonna put in
15:14 - all my information and i'm gonna hit log
15:17 - in all right now that i've logged in it
15:19 - should bring me to this page
15:21 - right here okay and all i have to do
15:23 - here is create a new page right there
15:27 - click and just call it home
15:29 - and i can just hit this tick mark right
15:32 - here okay
15:33 - and that's it that should do the trick
15:36 - and now
15:37 - if i zoom out just a little bit
15:39 - if i click that toggle you can see it's
15:41 - allowing me to add my first block and
15:43 - there you go this is a perfect place to
15:45 - start for us
15:47 - now before we keep coding this app up
15:50 - right this is our editor right here this
15:52 - is where we're at if i refresh this
15:55 - you're gonna see that error is now gone
15:58 - okay
15:59 - so this is the editor
16:01 - editor version if you want to get a
16:03 - preview link and see what your app looks
16:05 - like you could do that too or
16:07 - just grab this url right here right for
16:11 - example just click here that should just
16:13 - open it so one tab you should have your
16:15 - actual app and the second tab you should
16:18 - have the actual editor version where you
16:21 - can actually edit so i like
16:23 - that workflow
16:24 - now going back to this
16:26 - code here and just kind of understanding
16:29 - how this works react brix has
16:32 - something called the concept of bricks
16:35 - and in bricks you can actually make your
16:37 - own custom components so here's an
16:39 - example of your own custom component
16:41 - which is called
16:42 - my hero unit
16:44 - dot tsx all right
16:46 - and i'll show you what it looks like so
16:49 - if i go in here and i hit playground
16:51 - inside of playground
16:53 - when i scroll down over here you can see
16:56 - they're all these
16:57 - components right here already made like
16:59 - how the react stories
17:02 - library helps you do and if i hit my
17:05 - custom hero unit
17:07 - that's the custom hero unit that you
17:09 - have and you can actually even change it
17:12 - right here and it changes the code that
17:15 - you can see at the bottom
17:16 - so this allows you to play
17:18 - with your component that you've created
17:21 - so you could create your own components
17:22 - or you could use the components that the
17:25 - react bricks ui library they have a ui
17:28 - it's almost like a marketplace where
17:30 - they're pushing all their components
17:32 - and you're just getting access to a lot
17:34 - of these built-in components that are
17:36 - very nice
17:37 - and already made for you okay
17:40 - so perfect so i'm going to leave this
17:42 - one in playground so the first one is
17:43 - going to be here the second one is going
17:45 - to be in the admin third one is going to
17:48 - i'll just leave it in playground so we
17:49 - can check out different components
17:52 - now let's start working on this okay so
17:55 - i'm going to hit auto save so i have
17:57 - auto save
17:58 - enabled and that way when i'm working
18:01 - i won't forget to save anything okay and
18:03 - we'll start off with a hero unit and if
18:05 - you hover over and leave it for a second
18:08 - it'll even show you what those
18:10 - components are going to look like once
18:11 - you add them so we're going to start
18:12 - with the hero unit and here what we're
18:15 - going to do is i'm just going to say
18:17 - let's go back
18:18 - okay
18:19 - i'm going to say hi
18:21 - my name is
18:23 - and i'm going to make it gray
18:25 - and then here we're going to go ahead
18:27 - and say your actual name so rafikaze is
18:29 - my name you could put your name here
18:32 - right and then for the color
18:35 - we're going to give it a ocean gradient
18:37 - so that was nice
18:39 - and they make it really easy now i'm
18:42 - just gonna say i am a full stack
18:44 - dev
18:45 - okay
18:46 - and then for the copy i'm just gonna go
18:49 - ahead and write my copy here i'm gonna
18:51 - say i like to build
18:53 - amazing ui
18:55 - ux experience for humans a little emoji
18:59 - and currently i'm focused on empowering
19:03 - people to learn how to code and change
19:06 - their
19:08 - future
19:09 - perfect we'll add a little call to
19:10 - action so i'll hover over this and i'll
19:12 - remove this one and for this one i'll
19:14 - just say do you want to work with me
19:18 - okay and then we can actually pop in
19:20 - a linkedin url so i'll hide myself here
19:24 - so you could see
19:25 - and i could pop in a linkedin url right
19:28 - there so that way when they click it
19:30 - it'll take them to my linked all right
19:31 - let's bring myself back
19:33 - and i don't even really need to hit save
19:35 - on this auto saving but you could hit
19:37 - save anyway and now let's go to our home
19:39 - one right the one that's like live and
19:41 - currently working so let's refresh
19:44 - and let's see
19:45 - if there are any changes or anything
19:47 - that has actually happened yet boom look
19:49 - at that how fast was that we just did it
19:53 - we point and click came here and this is
19:56 - on the you know
19:57 - the deployed version or the version that
19:59 - will be deployed and it's already up and
20:02 - running it's that fast okay now there
20:05 - are a couple of things that i want to
20:06 - change like for example i don't we don't
20:09 - want the header and we will not even
20:11 - really need the footer
20:13 - for our portfolio so let's go ahead and
20:16 - take care of that so i'm going to go
20:18 - ahead inside of pages or sorry
20:20 - components let's go inside of layout
20:23 - and inside of layout let's get rid of
20:26 - footer and let's get rid of header
20:29 - and if we go back to our app it'll
20:32 - update shortly but we won't have the
20:34 - footer or the header
20:35 - anymore boom there you go the footer and
20:38 - header is completely gone and if i click
20:41 - this link
20:42 - it does take me to the linkedin my
20:45 - linkedin you could have people go
20:46 - wherever you want if you don't want it
20:47 - to be linkedin you could have it be
20:48 - something else it's totally up to you
20:50 - now what i want to do is i want to make
20:52 - this fully dark theme so what we're
20:55 - going to do is there's a little hack
20:58 - that we could do that's actually really
20:59 - cool and it will force it to actually be
21:02 - a dark theme so inside so let's go
21:05 - inside of our pages right over here so
21:08 - click pages and inside of our pages
21:11 - we're going to create a new page
21:13 - actually
21:14 - so let's just go ahead and close our
21:16 - blog and let's close our admin so our
21:18 - pages just looks like this
21:20 - click on pages and we're going to create
21:21 - a new page in here and it's going to be
21:23 - underscore document dot txt x
21:28 - it's very important you actually name it
21:30 - like that because that's
21:32 - there's a special little hack that we're
21:34 - pulling off in next.js to do this okay
21:37 - now here i'm gonna go ahead and i'm
21:39 - gonna say import
21:40 - and we'll do html with the capital h
21:43 - okay so this is another gotcha
21:46 - head with a capital h as well
21:48 - main okay
21:50 - and we're gonna get next script just
21:52 - like this
21:54 - okay
21:54 - and i'm gonna go ahead and say from next
21:57 - slash document
21:59 - now here's what we're going to do i'm
22:01 - going to say export default function and
22:04 - this function is going to be called
22:05 - document
22:06 - and then we're going to return
22:08 - and i will say html and then inside of
22:11 - this html we're going to say
22:14 - class name
22:15 - dark okay this is the trick that allows
22:18 - to make the whole thing dark just leave
22:20 - head empty for now
22:22 - and then we'll go body and inside of our
22:24 - body we'll put our main tag and it's
22:27 - self-closing and we will put our next
22:30 - script tag and this will also be
22:32 - self-closing tag
22:34 - and that's really it now once we do that
22:37 - should take care of making our app dark
22:39 - mode enabled all right there we go so
22:42 - let's take a look boom dark theme is
22:44 - enabled and it looks way better already
22:46 - in the dark theme now just keep in mind
22:48 - if some of this stuff doesn't load right
22:49 - away it's okay this takes a while so
22:53 - just make sure you refresh or you can
22:55 - kill the server and start it again like
22:57 - yarn control c to kill the server and
22:58 - then you are in dev to start it again
23:00 - and then just keep going back and
23:01 - refreshing until it's up and running so
23:04 - we got our first brick right here and
23:06 - it's working now let's go back to our
23:08 - editor
23:09 - so again remember even if you don't have
23:11 - the header you can still go back to edit
23:14 - mode by just simply
23:16 - going slash admin here and slash editor
23:19 - and it'll bring you to the editor okay
23:21 - that's it it's just a url so now here
23:24 - okay and i just enabled this is just for
23:27 - us to see okay what it looks like in
23:29 - different colors so we're just going to
23:30 - click this and stay in this one now
23:33 - what we want to do
23:34 - is the next thing you want to do is we
23:36 - want to add okay if we look at our final
23:39 - version our final version looks like
23:41 - this
23:42 - right so we want to add this section
23:44 - over here now you can use this section
23:47 - and you can change the logos to the
23:48 - companies that you've worked with
23:51 - and i think that would look fine okay
23:53 - that would look good so now click plus
23:55 - here and then we're just gonna choose
23:56 - customers
23:57 - and once you choose customers it's gonna
23:59 - bring
24:00 - that there okay
24:02 - so that's good that's what we want now
24:04 - if you want the color to be the same you
24:06 - could
24:07 - lay out and make it black okay or you
24:09 - can make it stand out
24:11 - up to you i just like it
24:13 - very subtle like this i just like
24:15 - leaving it at this okay the next thing
24:18 - that we're going to need to do is we're
24:19 - going to need to add this about me
24:21 - section right underneath us right
24:23 - underneath this so let's hit that plus
24:26 - and for that about me section actually
24:28 - we can actually just use another hero
24:31 - unit for that or we can actually use a
24:33 - text and image so click text and image
24:36 - and then in the image what i actually
24:38 - want to do is go ahead and move the
24:40 - image to the left just click left
24:44 - and then image on top on mobile so
24:46 - that's really helpful we're going to add
24:48 - shadow
24:49 - and we're going to
24:52 - click this right over here and what that
24:54 - will allow us to do is add rounded
24:57 - corners to the image so it'll make the
24:59 - image look really nice instead of you
25:00 - know like a square looking thing which
25:02 - doesn't look that pleasant to look at
25:05 - perfect
25:06 - now for the image where are we going to
25:08 - get these assets remember we gave you
25:10 - all of these assets right over here okay
25:13 - so you can pull these assets out from
25:15 - here you could download them right you
25:17 - could just hit download on this
25:20 - so right now the image that we need
25:21 - access to is my face cozy face so let's
25:24 - go ahead and hit download so we got that
25:27 - jpeg
25:28 - and now let's go back and i'm just going
25:30 - to go ahead and change this image
25:33 - and i'm going to go into my downloads
25:36 - and i got quasi and i'm going to hit
25:37 - open
25:38 - and that's it and again our seo see how
25:42 - easy that is we get the uploader and our
25:44 - seo is right there as well
25:46 - so let's go ahead and hit done
25:49 - and let's see
25:50 - our
25:51 - our guys show up perfect so guys showing
25:54 - up you can see that the there's rounded
25:57 - corners right there which is really nice
25:59 - okay and then i'm gonna say
26:01 - all right let's select this i'm gonna
26:03 - say i'm rafikaze we'll highlight this
26:06 - we'll click that select that and
26:07 - highlight it okay
26:09 - and then i'm going to put a coder thing
26:11 - here and i'll say i've been
26:13 - coding
26:14 - for nearly 10 years i'm a senior
26:17 - software developer who loves building
26:20 - full stack applications and learning
26:24 - new technologies i've also helped
26:28 - help millions
26:29 - of people learn how to code okay you
26:33 - could put whatever you want that's what
26:34 - i want to put here what matters to me
26:37 - and now i'll put a little fun fact and
26:38 - if this ever happens that's okay just
26:40 - hit x refresh and just come back so that
26:43 - happens from time to time or if and if
26:44 - it ever says like rebel is unable to
26:46 - wake up that means your rebel crashed
26:49 - here okay so just go ahead
26:52 - and cd into that folder portfolio app
26:56 - and then just hit yarn devs make sure
26:58 - that you cd first
27:00 - and then you hit yarn dev okay
27:03 - not a big deal once that gets up and
27:05 - running we'll be back in the editor
27:08 - and we'll fix
27:09 - any of our problems that we faced all
27:11 - right now we're back in the editor so
27:13 - let's go back here and
27:15 - i'll put a bulldog emoji
27:18 - or dog rather dog emoji and i'll hit
27:21 - enter okay
27:23 - and then i'll say when i'm not coding
27:25 - i am
27:27 - the proud father of a baby bulldog
27:31 - she's two years old
27:33 - two cats
27:34 - and a bunny okay
27:36 - my
27:37 - now on to the coding part okay
27:40 - my preferred
27:42 - weapons of choice and i'll put this guy
27:46 - right here
27:47 - and then to get those
27:48 - get to get these guys watch how easy it
27:51 - is okay so i go back here and just
27:53 - simply click feature
27:55 - all right so i'm going to click feature
27:56 - four times let's go like this
27:59 - and let's make them all blue okay and
28:02 - then i'll say
28:04 - javascript
28:06 - node
28:07 - we'll go right there and say next js
28:09 - slash react
28:11 - redux
28:12 - context and then for this i'm going to
28:14 - say firebase and i've actually been
28:16 - meaning to check out superbass as well
28:18 - so let's go firebase superbase
28:21 - all right so now the about me section is
28:23 - actually done and it was that fast let's
28:26 - add that divider in now okay so i'm
28:29 - gonna go ahead and add that divider in
28:31 - so we'll hit that plus sign at the
28:33 - bottom and then let's go hit horizontal
28:35 - rule we're done with that
28:37 - i'm gonna type in my coding project so
28:39 - let's go back here
28:41 - all right we're gonna choose hero unit
28:44 - we're going to remove this badge we
28:46 - don't need that we're going to remove
28:48 - we're going to select all of this and
28:49 - hit delete we will take that button
28:51 - delete it we'll take this button and
28:53 - delete it so delete both of the buttons
28:56 - and we're going to change that copy and
28:57 - it just says my coding projects and then
28:59 - the type attacks it shows it to you here
29:01 - but in your actual app it won't show it
29:04 - anywhere so let's go to our actual app
29:06 - and let's hit refresh and let's see if
29:07 - all of these changes are in fact taking
29:10 - place
29:11 - or is it just we're doing stuff and
29:12 - nothing is really happening so let's
29:14 - take a look
29:15 - boom look at that our header or our main
29:18 - hero plus our little testimonial logos
29:22 - social for social proof are showing up
29:24 - the about
29:25 - me section is showing up perfectly fine
29:28 - okay and we now just need to add a
29:30 - little button underneath that so let's
29:32 - go in here
29:33 - and watch how easy it is to add a button
29:35 - just simply click button so we'll click
29:37 - button and for this button click it and
29:40 - then we're gonna say
29:42 - my github so this should link to my
29:44 - github
29:45 - and i'll make it a outline so it's not
29:47 - solid because solid basically says hey
29:49 - click this is really important this is
29:51 - not that important so we'll make it like
29:53 - slightly outlined and then we'll put the
29:56 - link to our
29:57 - github repo okay and we'll say open a
29:59 - new event window so just select that
30:02 - perfect let's hit save that looks that
30:05 - should look pretty good and then let's
30:07 - get to work on adding our coding
30:10 - projects okay so these are the projects
30:12 - and this is how i want them to show up
30:15 - so i'm gonna go here
30:17 - plus sign
30:18 - this is crazy this is yes it's point and
30:21 - click but this is still
30:23 - react and next and you could customize
30:26 - it using next and react and typescript
30:29 - and underneath the hood is next and
30:30 - typescript and react and it's also
30:33 - they're hosting the backend and cms4
30:35 - units all-in-one to me this is
30:37 - mind-blowing like i really wish
30:39 - i knew this and i could use it for other
30:41 - things but for building things like
30:43 - portfolio you can update your portfolio
30:45 - so easily like everybody else who's just
30:48 - custom coding every single line of their
30:50 - portfolio is a nightmare for them to
30:51 - update it people update their portfolio
30:53 - every three years or four years if it's
30:56 - this easy you can update in a second you
30:58 - do a new project just add it in huge
31:00 - advantage so let's go back to the final
31:02 - version and final version we have web3
31:05 - exchange tracker and it's a text in an
31:07 - image so we're going to go ahead and
31:09 - choose text image all right and let's
31:12 - see where the image is so images on the
31:14 - left hand side so what are we going to
31:15 - do we're going to click image we're
31:16 - going to choose left
31:18 - for we're going to choose image shadow
31:20 - image around corner and image on top on
31:22 - mobile so now already again this is
31:24 - mobile friendly right so if you were to
31:27 - scroll this image already knows to be on
31:30 - top
31:31 - and
31:32 - how long did this take us like almost
31:34 - not long at all a few minutes and we're
31:36 - good to go all right so let's go ahead
31:39 - and now add
31:40 - the project image okay which project are
31:42 - we looking for
31:44 - in this case we're looking for the
31:45 - coinbase one so i'm gonna go ahead and
31:47 - hit download on my coinbase project
31:49 - and click here and then we're gonna add
31:52 - in our coinbase project all right let's
31:55 - say quiz app done so done with the seo
31:58 - right there it's enter all right and
32:01 - we'll leave it as large and i'll say
32:03 - web3 exchange tracker okay or whatever
32:07 - you want to call it
32:08 - and then for the copy i'll just
32:11 - copy this and paste it so we don't have
32:13 - to write it all from scratch oh that was
32:16 - weird
32:17 - there we go
32:18 - all right
32:19 - and now underneath this we're gonna go
32:22 - ahead and link the github repo so i'll
32:25 - put a link and we'll say github repo
32:28 - so this is where i'll actually put the
32:30 - link to
32:32 - this
32:32 - repository okay you could put the link
32:35 - to any of your github repositories so
32:38 - i'm going to go to the final version
32:39 - click that copy that github link come
32:42 - back to ours
32:44 - and
32:45 - bold it and link it
32:47 - and paste the github link so now the
32:49 - github linking is done
32:51 - now i want to add
32:53 - these features to it so let's go ahead
32:55 - and add those features i'll just add
32:57 - something dummy underneath just so i can
32:59 - scroll properly all right
33:02 - so to add those features just click
33:04 - feature four times so feature and then
33:07 - we want it all to be blue just click it
33:09 - and then click blue all right and then
33:11 - what do we wanted to say we
33:13 - we say that our stack is next.js for
33:16 - this we also use solidity in this
33:18 - project let's go say solidity
33:21 - we use sanity as a headless cms and then
33:24 - we also do authentication with metamask
33:27 - so let's put that there a crypto
33:28 - conversion app like coinbase using nexjs
33:31 - solidity third web sdk sanity as a
33:33 - headless cms authentication with
33:34 - metamask and style components for
33:36 - styling now if you want to go really far
33:38 - and add these logos that would be really
33:40 - impressive for whoever's viewing your
33:42 - portfolio but if you don't want to add
33:44 - that just add at least the image of the
33:46 - app that you've built
33:48 - that would be fairly impressive so look
33:51 - this looks so beautiful right you have
33:54 - the project you have what the project
33:56 - does you have the link to the repo you
33:59 - have the key features that stand out
34:02 - so i really love that about it now the
34:04 - one last thing i want to add is you want
34:05 - to add a button underneath it okay and
34:07 - the button should say view demo so we're
34:10 - going to go here make it outline we'll
34:12 - say view demo
34:14 - and we want to link to the actual app
34:16 - itself so i'll click here i'll grab that
34:19 - url for the actual app and we'll paste
34:21 - that right here okay and you could use
34:24 - your apps here okay you don't need to
34:25 - use my apps here you could use whatever
34:27 - you want or just copy my links at least
34:30 - for now to make it work
34:32 - okay
34:32 - and i'll hit save
34:34 - let's go back and take a look at our
34:37 - app outside of the editor mode and let's
34:39 - just make sure that all the changes that
34:41 - we've added so far are actually showing
34:44 - up so let's scroll down boom i got my
34:47 - hero i got my about me my coding project
34:50 - the image is taking a second so we'll
34:52 - give it some rest
34:54 - and then hopefully the image once it
34:56 - cached it's probably quicker okay so
34:58 - let's i don't know where the heck the
35:00 - image is but everything else is showing
35:03 - up so that's a really good sign boom
35:05 - there we go the image is showing up look
35:07 - at that that looks beautiful and now
35:09 - what we want to do is we want to have
35:11 - multiple projects we want to have a
35:13 - medium style blogging app and a facebook
35:16 - one so i'm gonna go back
35:18 - and all we're gonna do here is let's
35:20 - just duplicate this bad boy so this is
35:22 - gonna be very easy click that copy
35:24 - button okay and i'll just duplicate the
35:26 - block so duplicate the block and
35:28 - duplicate it one more time so now you
35:30 - have three projects you can show off i
35:32 - like these two alternate so let's go to
35:35 - image and let's go image on the right
35:38 - to project here on the left image on the
35:40 - right on this one
35:42 - and
35:42 - we'll leave the last one as it is
35:45 - perfect so now they're alternating so
35:47 - that looks really nice second project we
35:49 - will call it medium style blogging app
35:52 - so let's go ahead paste that there
35:54 - i will grab the copy from a file version
35:57 - a blogging app like medium using nexus
35:59 - solidity
36:00 - actually we don't have solidity in here
36:02 - so
36:03 - i'll paste that in here and we'll remove
36:06 - solidity and third web sdk because we
36:08 - don't have that and we also don't have
36:10 - sanity for this and we're not using
36:12 - styled components
36:14 - okay so blogging app like medium using
36:16 - nextgs and tailwind css okay let's just
36:20 - say that
36:21 - say tailwind css
36:24 - next.js and then are there any other
36:26 - like key features of that app for now
36:29 - they're not that many so we can
36:32 - oh yeah there's authentication with
36:34 - firebase or we can say firebase
36:38 - so
36:39 - yes authentication
36:41 - and database with firebase okay so
36:44 - that's another key component
36:46 - and we can actually say another key
36:48 - component is user and tickation all
36:51 - right
36:52 - boom there we go now repo
36:55 - and the demo make sure you link that
36:57 - properly i will just leave this as is
37:00 - and for image go ahead and change the
37:02 - image so we're going to go back to our
37:04 - up and we're going to get not the coin
37:07 - base one cause we don't need that we're
37:09 - done with that we need the medium one so
37:11 - go ahead and download it
37:13 - let's go back here to our editor
37:16 - click
37:17 - and we're gonna find medium and click it
37:21 - and then boom
37:22 - all right i didn't update the seo you
37:24 - can update seo as well medium
37:27 - app and let's hit done
37:29 - there we go
37:30 - okay and if i want this repo to be
37:33 - working perfectly then i want to copy
37:36 - this
37:37 - make sure that i link it correctly so
37:40 - paste
37:41 - and then let's get the demo
37:43 - copy the demo link
37:45 - go here
37:46 - hover over it paste
37:48 - and hit save anyway just so it's saves
37:52 - all right and then the last one
37:54 - is a web3 social media app on salon on
37:56 - blockchain okay so basically building
37:58 - facebook on solana blockchain so let's
38:00 - go ahead and write that
38:02 - for the image let's go ahead and
38:05 - download the facebook image i'm going to
38:07 - download let's go to our app
38:10 - let's change this image and we're going
38:12 - to go ahead and choose this facebook one
38:16 - right here let's choose that book and
38:18 - we're gonna say
38:20 - facebook app
38:22 - and look at the speed we're moving with
38:24 - right doing this much front-end work
38:25 - would take you forever
38:28 - normally this part of the tutorial has
38:30 - already taken us like four hours or two
38:33 - hours or three hours and it's ridiculous
38:35 - so front end get it done fast
38:38 - still slick you can customize it more if
38:40 - you want to or need to the full stack
38:42 - developer this is a dream honestly come
38:43 - true let's go ahead ignore my dog if you
38:46 - hear any barking it's my baby bulldog
38:50 - and there you go it's a facebook clone
38:52 - app built on solana blockchain
38:54 - leveraging the blockchain technology
38:56 - you're able to create posts authenticate
38:58 - the user base on their wallet and post
38:59 - comments all on chain okay
39:02 - now for features
39:04 - blockchain is definitely a feature we
39:06 - want to highlight
39:08 - we want to highlight the fact that we're
39:10 - using solana here okay slash rust okay
39:15 - we're using sanity as a headless cms so
39:18 - that's important and then we also have
39:21 - next.js and
39:23 - yes this does have authentication as
39:25 - well okay so there we go
39:27 - now
39:28 - we're gonna grab the repo link so i'm
39:30 - gonna go here
39:32 - pop in our repo link
39:34 - and we'll also grab the demo link it's a
39:38 - demo link all right let's go ahead paste
39:40 - that there and we'll say open a new
39:43 - window so for all the demos
39:45 - like all the links make sure that they
39:47 - open in a new window because you don't
39:49 - want your user to like go somewhere else
39:52 - when they click it they should just open
39:54 - everything up in a new window
39:56 - it should still have access to your
39:58 - portfolio beautiful so we're done with
40:00 - all of that now what else is left
40:03 - we need to get to our experience part
40:05 - okay so let's hit plus here
40:07 - we're going to add in a horizontal rule
40:10 - and then
40:11 - oops where did my horizontal rule go so
40:13 - let's click this let's add in our
40:15 - horizontal
40:16 - rule
40:17 - okay i hope
40:19 - i don't know why it's not adding it okay
40:21 - let's try adding in something else let's
40:23 - try adding in a hero unit which we have
40:26 - here so that's good and we're going to
40:28 - remove the badge we're going to remove
40:30 - all of this copy here i'm going to
40:32 - remove the buttons
40:34 - okay click the buttons and then click
40:36 - remove
40:37 - and we're going to change the size of
40:38 - this tile size to medium
40:40 - and here i'm simply just going to say
40:44 - i'll try to make myself small so i'm not
40:46 - in
40:47 - the way of anything but
40:49 - you can still hang out with me because
40:50 - i'll put myself right there all right
40:53 - so we develop beautiful application
40:54 - instead of that we're going to say
40:56 - my experience all right
40:59 - and there we go okay that's it so we're
41:01 - done with that section
41:03 - now let's add in i'm going to add again
41:05 - leave a hero unit at the bottom so i can
41:07 - do stuff and now all we need is a bunch
41:10 - of hero units actually so watch this i'm
41:14 - gonna go here choose a hero unit
41:17 - and this is gonna be really clean so
41:20 - just replace that
41:22 - here with best buy okay and i worked
41:24 - with the geek squad department to help
41:26 - with customer service and fulfill order
41:28 - slash refunds you could write your own
41:31 - copy there whatever your experience was
41:34 - we don't need any call to action so
41:35 - simply just remove them
41:37 - and instead of this we'll say the years
41:39 - we worked so we'll just say 2018 to 2020
41:43 - we worked at best buy boom so we're done
41:46 - with that now let's duplicate that okay
41:49 - and let's go
41:50 - maybe 20 oh the years are messed up
41:53 - there okay i see so we'll go 2019 for
41:56 - best buy then we'll go 2019 for
41:59 - the next one we'll go 2019 to 2021
42:04 - or 2020 is fine and we'll say apple
42:08 - and i worked with them to build out an
42:09 - apple music integration into homepod
42:12 - mini using their sdk
42:14 - perfect let's paste that over here
42:16 - and then let's add one more hero units
42:21 - oh actually don't do that that's silly
42:23 - go ahead duplicate this and we'll go
42:26 - 2020
42:28 - 2020 to 2022 or you could say present if
42:32 - you're still working there okay so you
42:33 - could even put present there and now
42:36 - we'll say meta right previously facebook
42:39 - so that's another company you're working
42:42 - at let's just say and we can make these
42:44 - medium if you want so if you don't want
42:46 - them to be like massive you can make
42:47 - them medium and here i said i worked on
42:50 - designing and implementing the oculus vr
42:53 - landing page i optimized the performance
42:55 - using nexus and lighthouse that increase
42:57 - the performance by 378 percent so let's
43:00 - get that popping okay let's just hit say
43:03 - beautiful now we need to add another
43:05 - divider so let's add another horizontal
43:08 - rule and after this we need to add what
43:11 - clients say working with me so let's add
43:13 - another hero unit
43:15 - let's remove this we don't need this
43:18 - remove the buttons don't need that
43:20 - okay and let's make this medium and i'll
43:23 - copy this right here we'll paste that
43:26 - boom okay and here's the here's what
43:29 - essentially the clients say so now we're
43:31 - going to add a new section and we'll
43:33 - click testimonial
43:36 - okay and for testimonial you can
43:38 - say whatever somebody said about you as
43:40 - a testimonial maybe it could even be a
43:42 - teacher that something said something
43:44 - great about you it could be a boss that
43:46 - says something great about you at a job
43:48 - that's not even developer related
43:49 - necessarily make sure you have
43:51 - testimonials because they're really
43:53 - going to help you land the job that
43:55 - you're actually looking for
43:57 - i think it's a very key component don't
43:59 - miss out on them don't get lazy on this
44:01 - stuff
44:02 - put in the effort make it look beautiful
44:05 - work on it it'll help you land the job
44:08 - once you get one job for 60 70 80 90 000
44:11 - a year you're good you're making
44:13 - progress so here
44:16 - instead of matteo frana or whatever it
44:18 - says i will say david riccosi said this
44:21 - about me okay
44:23 - and he's the cto
44:25 - at let's say clever programmer okay and
44:28 - now let's go ahead and get the clever
44:30 - programmer logo
44:31 - let's get david's
44:34 - face image
44:35 - let's change this let's go to downloads
44:38 - and put his face image i'll zoom in so
44:41 - we can see his beautiful face and
44:44 - beautiful hair
44:45 - and we'll say david
44:48 - david let's hit done okay and then let's
44:50 - go here we'll change this to be the
44:53 - clever programmer logo instead ep logo
44:57 - let's hit done
44:58 - and there we go now let's go ahead
45:02 - and refresh this bad boy and take a look
45:05 - scroll down we got our about me section
45:07 - we got our coding project showing up if
45:09 - i click the github repo
45:11 - it does take me to the github repo
45:14 - if i go back
45:15 - let's wait for the rebel to wake up
45:18 - unless we killed it by mistake
45:20 - all right so those links work my github
45:22 - link works let's check the demo
45:24 - the demo is up and running let's check
45:26 - the demo for our medium app
45:29 - that one looks to be also up and running
45:31 - let's check the demo for this
45:33 - this is up and running it's just that we
45:35 - made the facebook clone so good that it
45:37 - thinks it's a phishing scam it's not
45:40 - you can just hit unsafe site and boom
45:42 - you can go straight to it okay so that's
45:44 - up and running our the github repo link
45:47 - is good to go my experience for every
45:50 - where we worked and then what my clients
45:52 - say about me now at the end
45:55 - let's just end it off with a nice little
45:57 - call to action how we have here so what
45:59 - you could do is you could actually
46:01 - scroll all the way down we'll hit plus
46:04 - and we'll finish it with
46:06 - let's see call to action all right and
46:10 - call to action you can make it large you
46:12 - can make it medium or small whatever you
46:14 - want we'll keep it small because small
46:16 - looks great
46:17 - and let's paste that there want me to
46:20 - build stuff want me building stuff for
46:22 - you hit me on linkedin all right hit me
46:25 - on linkedin and my linkedin that's all
46:28 - we got to say right there my
46:30 - linkedin
46:31 - and then just make it sky blue
46:34 - and we'll paste our linkedin link
46:36 - and there you go
46:38 - okay
46:39 - this is your brand new portfolio and
46:41 - look at how fast we did it honestly like
46:43 - that was
46:45 - lightning fast right if you go fully
46:47 - fast without even that much explanation
46:49 - you could get this done in 20 minutes
46:52 - after watching this or if you're doing
46:54 - this with me and the whole thing is
46:56 - ready to go
46:57 - if you want to customize it you want to
46:59 - add your own
47:01 - flair to it you want to add your own
47:02 - custom components remember
47:04 - you can go ahead and create so first of
47:07 - all you can mess around with components
47:08 - right here so you can mess around with
47:10 - layout and everything right here that's
47:12 - one thing the second thing is in react
47:14 - breaks is where you're going to write
47:15 - most of your code and you could play
47:17 - around with your units you could create
47:20 - a my hero unit
47:21 - and add changes to it so for example if
47:23 - i change anything in this unit saying we
47:26 - are clever programmers let's just say we
47:28 - say now if i go into our playground and
47:32 - we refresh
47:34 - that component that we
47:36 - have
47:37 - custom hero unit right it says we are
47:40 - clever programmers it brings that up and
47:42 - if i go into our editor and we try to
47:44 - add in a new block and i hit customer
47:46 - hero unit
47:47 - this is our custom hero unit that we
47:50 - have so if i go back this okay let's go
47:53 - here and let's delete it and let's
47:55 - refresh real quick and then let's try
47:56 - again so that was our custom hero unit
47:59 - and you can make different changes to it
48:01 - as well so let's go all the way down
48:03 - let's delete this
48:04 - let's add a new one custom here a unit
48:07 - right it says we are clever programmers
48:09 - that's so it proves us the one that we
48:12 - added right
48:13 - now on the right hand side you'll see
48:14 - that it says you can choose big padding
48:16 - or you could choose small padding how's
48:18 - that happening if i go back here you can
48:21 - see
48:22 - that we have side edit props so what are
48:24 - the props that you want to decide we
48:26 - only have one padding that's it and on
48:29 - padding we say you could choose the
48:30 - value to be big or the value to be small
48:33 - right padding big
48:35 - or small what do you want default is big
48:38 - okay
48:39 - so that's how we're choosing the styling
48:41 - okay and then boom
48:43 - if i remove that from the
48:45 - i could if i remove that from there or i
48:47 - could change the label to huge padding
48:50 - okay
48:51 - now if we come refresh this
48:53 - and go back
48:55 - right
48:55 - huge padding small padding huge padding
48:57 - so you can clearly create your own
49:00 - components you can clearly add them to
49:04 - your
49:04 - app okay
49:06 - so if you keep creating your own
49:07 - components you could keep adding your
49:09 - custom bricks here so they have their
49:12 - website break
49:14 - right that's a website break they have a
49:15 - blog brick they have a hero unit and
49:18 - then you could keep creating your own
49:19 - custom ones and just keep popping them
49:21 - in here keep popping them in here all
49:24 - right that's where we got the hero unit
49:26 - from which is our hero unit and you
49:27 - could create your own custom components
49:30 - keep popping them in and then do
49:31 - whatever you want so you can see that
49:33 - the power of it
49:35 - is really like infinite anyways i'm
49:37 - blown away that this type of tool exists
49:40 - i hope that you enjoyed watching this
49:43 - and building this out with me gotta get
49:45 - the set ready
49:47 - and if you enjoyed it make sure you
49:49 - smash the like button so this video goes
49:51 - out to as many developers as possible
49:53 - make sure you subscribe to the channel
49:55 - so you can learn
49:56 - more about different tips and techniques
49:58 - with javascript next web 2 web 3 and
50:02 - take your journey to a whole another
50:04 - level with that said i love your
50:06 - beautiful face and as always i'm quasi
50:10 - if you don't know me and i'll see you
50:13 - in the next
50:14 - video
50:15 - now for the final step we're gonna
50:17 - deploy this app so let's get it poppin
50:21 - let's go to our package.json
50:24 - right over here okay package.json
50:28 - and inside of here we're gonna just add
50:30 - literally two lines of code
50:34 - inside of the scripts put a comma here
50:36 - and we're going to add in another script
50:39 - and this script is going to be for
50:40 - export so we're going to go ahead and go
50:43 - export
50:44 - and
50:45 - we're going to go ahead and say yarn run
50:48 - build and
50:49 - next export and then mv out static so
50:54 - that's one thing that we need
50:56 - the second thing that we actually need
50:59 - is let's go here
51:00 - and we're gonna go ahead and do
51:03 - engines so let's go ahead and do engines
51:06 - just like this and then we're gonna say
51:09 - node
51:10 - and let's go 14 point x on that
51:13 - okay
51:14 - and then put another comma so make sure
51:16 - that you have engines and comma here
51:18 - like this so these are really the
51:20 - two-ish lines of code that we needed to
51:22 - write
51:24 - and that's it on the coding end all
51:25 - right so now that we're actually ready
51:27 - to get this app deployed
51:30 - all we actually need to do at this point
51:32 - is we need to just download this folder
51:35 - so we're going to go right over here
51:37 - okay you can
51:38 - click here and we'll just download a zip
51:41 - the whole thing
51:42 - all right
51:43 - and let's open this bad boy up
51:46 - we're and we're going to make this as
51:47 - simple as possible to deploy it so
51:49 - they're not a lot of there's not any
51:50 - confusing steps okay
51:53 - all right so there it is we only need
51:55 - access to this folder right here
51:57 - portfolio yt app we don't really care
51:59 - about anything else so here's what we're
52:01 - gonna do we're gonna go into our github
52:04 - and we're just gonna create a brand new
52:06 - repo so let's hit new repo
52:08 - and we're gonna say yt portfolio app you
52:11 - could call it whatever you want and then
52:14 - i'm simply gonna say create repository
52:16 - okay
52:17 - and then all we want to do here is
52:19 - upload an existing file and we'll just
52:21 - drag and drop our folder here now if it
52:24 - doesn't actually start putting it in
52:26 - here
52:27 - what we're going to do is we're going to
52:28 - just go ahead and delete node modules
52:30 - because that ends up adding a lot of
52:32 - extra files so remove that
52:34 - and then let's go ahead and put it in
52:36 - and now it should say hey uploading blah
52:38 - blah of 38 files or 37 files however
52:41 - many files there are
52:43 - and it should start downloading it
52:45 - putting it in the repo okay
52:47 - and so we'll say
52:49 - finish building portfolio app all right
52:53 - let's hit commit changes
52:55 - and now it'll take a few minutes to
52:57 - process the files so
52:58 - just be patient here wait a little bit
53:00 - and then once this is ready to go
53:02 - we're literally one step away from
53:04 - making this entire thing work
53:06 - okay so you can see there's a folder
53:08 - portfolio it app
53:10 - okay
53:11 - and when i click that everything is
53:14 - inside of it
53:16 - so there you go
53:17 - now let's go to digital lotion and we're
53:20 - going to do is we're going to hit create
53:21 - app okay so if you weren't in there just
53:24 - make sure you choose apps and then
53:25 - create app
53:27 - we're gonna go to github
53:28 - okay
53:29 - and make sure that you give it if it
53:31 - asks for your permissions just go ahead
53:33 - log in with your github give it all the
53:35 - permissions that it needs and then for
53:37 - source directory let's try doing slash
53:39 - portfolio yt app or actually what was
53:43 - ours yeah portfolio yt app that's the
53:45 - directory right and it's inside of the
53:47 - branch main
53:49 - yes it is and then which repository is
53:51 - it it's yt portfolio app so it's
53:54 - actually a different one okay so i'm
53:56 - going to go ahead and edit my
53:57 - permissions
53:59 - and let's give it all repositories okay
54:02 - so if you've done that already then
54:04 - great but i hadn't done that
54:06 - earlier
54:07 - all right
54:08 - so let's choose the repository in that
54:10 - repository called yt
54:12 - portfolio
54:14 - there we go
54:15 - all right
54:16 - let's put the folder name
54:18 - and then let's hit next and let's see if
54:21 - it figures out what it needs to figure
54:24 - out
54:24 - yes it has so that's really good
54:27 - now go ahead and hit next for resources
54:30 - we're good on resources
54:32 - for global we're gonna go ahead and hit
54:34 - edit okay and we're just gonna add in a
54:37 - couple of api keys here that are going
54:39 - to be helpful all right and this is
54:41 - because we need access to certain
54:42 - environment variables that know how to
54:44 - go into your react bricks and pull out
54:46 - the data
54:47 - so let's go into our app let's go to v
54:51 - dot local
54:52 - and here you need to access your api key
54:55 - so let's go
54:56 - copy the word api key let's go to
54:59 - digital ocean paste that right there
55:01 - okay let's hit another one right here
55:03 - let's copy next public id let's go
55:07 - back to digitalocean and paste that
55:09 - right there okay
55:11 - and then let's copy this entire thing go
55:15 - back to digitalocean
55:17 - and paste it for the api key and then
55:19 - copy this entire next public id go here
55:22 - and paste that all right now let's hit
55:24 - save so now those two environment
55:26 - variables are saved that's good that's
55:28 - what we're looking for
55:30 - yep
55:31 - that looks great that looks great let's
55:34 - hit next
55:35 - all right and then just go down hit edit
55:37 - plan
55:38 - okay and
55:39 - you could pick the cheapest one all
55:42 - right so now if you're here on this page
55:44 - let's not pick pro because we don't need
55:46 - to pay 12
55:47 - or sorry 24 a month for this we could
55:50 - have a pretty simple basic this is not a
55:53 - static site so we won't be able to
55:55 - choose a starter plan but if you did
55:56 - that would be free but we don't have
55:59 - that we're gonna pick something really
56:00 - small like the five dollars a month one
56:02 - okay so it's gonna be uh five dollars a
56:04 - month but you get to deploy your app you
56:06 - get to see it you get to share with
56:08 - everybody and i think just that
56:10 - experience of knowing how to do it and
56:12 - even putting on your portfolio that
56:13 - you've deployed something with
56:14 - digitalocean a lot of people and
56:17 - recruiters know digital lotion so
56:19 - that'll actually give you a like up okay
56:21 - let's go ahead and review
56:24 - all right so now just hit back okay so
56:26 - we've edited our plan
56:28 - all right and then we're just gonna go
56:30 - ahead and hit create
56:32 - sources and then once it goes through
56:35 - then our app is ready and then that app
56:37 - can be deployed okay so it says it has
56:39 - been created
56:40 - and now it's gonna
56:42 - push it pushed the deployment and now
56:44 - it's building so it's going to go
56:46 - through the process and then once it's
56:47 - fully built and ready to go
56:49 - you'll be able to go to it and if you
56:51 - ever want to just get rid of your entire
56:53 - app completely you could always go at
56:55 - the bottom and you could destroy it okay
56:58 - so you can hit that button they'll
57:00 - destroy this digitalocean like app slash
57:03 - container and then you won't be ever
57:05 - charged for it or anything like that
57:07 - okay but i still think it's
57:09 - worth a shot to do this and then be able
57:11 - to see your app once it's built all
57:14 - right if this is loading don't worry
57:15 - about it guys it takes a little bit of
57:17 - time so give it a couple of minutes go
57:19 - for a walk relax go for a jog run a
57:22 - marathon have a good time and then you
57:24 - can come back it'll still be there it'll
57:26 - probably be almost done at that point
57:28 - okay grab some tea because the finishing
57:30 - touches so we needed to take some time
57:33 - build up that ritualistic experience so
57:35 - when it's finally live you feel this
57:38 - cathartic experience right because it
57:40 - wouldn't be fun if it just got done fast
57:42 - so relax enjoy go walk around and then
57:45 - come back and we'll be good to go all
57:48 - right there we go the deployment is done
57:51 - let's click it and let's see if our app
57:54 - is indeed live
57:56 - so let's click that link right there
