09:09 - our live stream isn't that crazy guys
09:12 - like have you ever seen one hundred
09:14 - thirteen thousand comments
09:16 - unlike Facebook comments in in a five
09:19 - day challenge to pretty much anywhere
09:21 - like I don't know to me that's a little
09:22 - crazy of course if you go to like some
09:24 - famous person like Kanye West or
09:25 - whatever right you'll see like hundred
09:26 - thousand comments on one post but for us
09:29 - was a really big deal especially for
09:30 - coding and JavaScript like come on so
09:33 - that was that was exciting and very
09:34 - humbling so last time in the projects
09:38 - right we built a really incredible
09:40 - projects and we just want to share some
09:41 - of them with you guys so like for
09:43 - example we built a store locator in our
09:46 - last project for Google Maps and we had
09:48 - people like 5,000 people submit their
09:51 - own projects so I wanted you to start
09:52 - seeing for yourself like what are you
09:54 - gonna be doing this project what kind of
09:56 - things are you gonna build and could
09:57 - this be you during this challenge like
10:00 - building these incredible apps right
10:03 - here's Jen and she built a store locator
10:05 - that's amazing vaibhavi made a store
10:07 - locator
10:08 - here's Rehan she made a store locator
10:10 - but she customized and design in her own
10:12 - way and these are just everyday average
10:14 - normal people some of them have some
10:16 - more experience a lot of them are
10:18 - complete beginners in coding so like are
10:20 - you a complete beginner in coding and if
10:22 - you are that's totally okay you're in a
10:24 - fine place you'll learn how to build
10:25 - this right Jonelle like made this really
10:28 - slick app and it looks awesome by the
10:31 - way who here wants to be able to build a
10:33 - project like this let me know would you
10:36 - guys wanna would it be cool if you could
10:38 - build this project during these five
10:41 - days and actually put on your portfolio
10:42 - I think that would be pretty freakin
10:46 - awesome alright and here we got a live
10:51 - demo for you guys of an app built by one
10:54 - of our students Vaughn Tong and I hope
10:56 - that this demo works so I'll try to show
10:58 - you guys this demo cool click it can we
11:02 - click it oh yeah here we go we got the
11:04 - link boom so here's the demo right check
11:08 - this out absolutely beautiful app so of
11:13 - Anton what he did is he took the Google
11:15 - Maps app and customized it into his own
11:17 - thing so I want you to start thinking
11:18 - about how would you customize it could
11:21 - you customize it to coronavirus app he
11:23 - took the Google Maps app and turn it
11:25 - into coronavirus app and you guys could
11:27 - actually go to this app and view it for
11:29 - yourself as well
11:30 - so here you can actually click anywhere
11:33 - so let's say I click Algeria and take a
11:35 - look at this right right when I click
11:36 - Algeria I can see the cases in Algeria I
11:39 - can see how many people have recovered I
11:40 - can see the number of debts
11:42 - I can click whose biggest on and I can
11:44 - find out the number of cases how many
11:46 - recovered all of that right I can click
11:49 - on Pakistan Nepal Poland doesn't matter
11:51 - I can click on all of these I can even
11:53 - search up a country like this USA
11:57 - boom click it and then it'll take us to
12:00 - USA right here and pop it up pretty
12:02 - freakin cool right who thinks this app
12:04 - is cool I think this app is super
12:06 - freaking cool and take a look at this
12:07 - where it says at the bottom true news on
12:10 - CCP virus so this app even integrated
12:13 - true news so when you click it it
12:14 - actually shows you some like different
12:16 - awesome resources for coronavirus that
12:19 - are happening right now you could take a
12:21 - look and be informed ok I think it's
12:24 - brilliant what you can do with coding
12:26 - and the possibilities are really
12:27 - limitless and honestly how I think about
12:31 - coding so I'm gonna get out of here how
12:34 - I think about coding is it's kind of
12:36 - like you know how this if Rajini you
12:38 - only have what three wishes you can make
12:41 - but coding I feel like you learn how to
12:43 - make unlimited wishes to the genie like
12:46 - literally the world is yours whatever
12:48 - you can think and dream you can create
12:50 - and then people can use it so I feel
12:52 - like it's just such a good outlet for
12:54 - yourself and then you can bring so much
12:56 - value to the world and solve problems I
12:58 - hope you find that cool too isn't that

16:59 - so proud of her we were so excited so I
17:01 - just really wanted to share that with
17:03 - you guys all right let's keep it going
17:06 - Jose who joined our program you know he
17:10 - had lost his job because of kovat 19 and
17:12 - now he wants to become a JavaScript
17:14 - developer so he can have new sources of
17:16 - income I'm glad you guys love that part
17:20 - I said I you know I wanted to share that
17:22 - with you guys and just really yeah I
17:24 - don't know it was just it's just awesome
17:26 - thank you guys for a long me too
17:27 - actually sure that with you so Jose here
17:30 - right he joined our program profit with
17:32 - JavaScript because he saw an ad but he
17:34 - says like look I was working and I ended
17:36 - up losing my job who here by the way has
17:38 - lost their jobs because I covet 19 if
17:40 - you have just drop it in the comments
17:42 - below I would love to see it I mean I
17:44 - wouldn't love to see it
17:45 - but I would love to know what's going on
17:47 - actually and then maybe how we can help
17:49 - you right because if we can help you
17:50 - that just gives us more purpose and more
17:53 - that we want to do for you so has they
17:57 - actually lost his job due to coronavirus
17:59 - coming up you know on March 20th he says
18:02 - I was one of the 13 people that were let
18:04 - go due to the impact that the virus had
18:06 - and it costs words the company and he
18:10 - goes I'm currently working on becoming a
18:12 - better developer so that I can get a job
18:13 - within the industry and do coaching
18:15 - slash freelance work on the side this
18:18 - entire experience has shown me that
18:19 - having one source of income is a bad
18:21 - idea looking to turn this entire
18:23 - negative into a positive
18:25 - all right I see a lot of you guys a lost
18:27 - opportunity to get a job because of Cove
18:29 - 8:19 some of you just told me right now
18:30 - you lost an internship because of this
18:33 - Louie just says I lost my job
18:35 - Jessica told me she lost her job
18:38 - somebody said my life is harsh because
18:40 - of this yeah a lot of people are losing
18:44 - Leonardo said I lost my job aslam says I
18:46 - lost my job lost my job yeah so that's
18:49 - actually this is insane right so what
18:51 - would it mean for you to have this news
18:53 - like powerful tool like JavaScript or be
18:57 - able to learn a new skill set that then
19:00 - can give you more opportunity because
19:02 - guys reality is like coding is not going
19:05 - anywhere and everything is run by
19:07 - software for example think about posts
19:09 - mates and zoom and all of this right
19:11 - zoom has only gone up in use and now
19:15 - they need like a bajillion developers to
19:17 - be able to keep up with that right so
19:20 - you could see it as a really really bad
19:22 - thing or you could see it as like a
19:23 - powerful thing maybe you were like you
19:26 - know and I want to know this as well oh
19:27 - like that this happen to you where you
19:30 - were maybe kind of on the fence about
19:31 - becoming a developer for a while but
19:33 - kind of like coronavirus happening kind
19:35 - of set in the reality and now it's like
19:38 - actually one of your biggest driving
19:39 - forces you kind of want to get there
19:40 - faster do any of you guys feel like that
19:43 - but by any chance cuz I feel like for a
19:46 - person like me it gives me a kick and
19:48 - ask actually go and do more so honestly

23:34 - question baby we should just play that
23:40 - video right now that'd be funny all
23:42 - right so here's me just a humble guy
23:45 - from Pakistan not really that humble
23:48 - unfortunately I'm becoming more humble
23:49 - I'm learning how to become more humble
23:52 - yep and you know I started the channel I
23:56 - started on this journey of coding and I
23:57 - sucked my biggest motivation was my mom
24:00 - and being able to help her and get her
24:01 - surgery and that was like my driving
24:03 - force for why I wanted to learn coding
24:05 - and why I wanted to actually like make
24:07 - an income with coding and freelance and
24:10 - be my own boss and everything because I
24:11 - want to be able to spend time with my
24:12 - family take care of my family and then
24:15 - also I most importantly be able to
24:17 - provide financially for my family and
24:19 - for myself and so I started my youtube
24:23 - channel few years later boom it's it
24:26 - grew from zero nothing to over six
24:28 - hundred thousand almost six hundred
24:30 - thousand subscribers which is absolutely
24:32 - crazy I mean I'm just one guy and there

24:41 - 21 I figured out how to make a hundred
24:44 - four thousand dollars a year as a
24:46 - freelance developer
24:48 - and I remember my professor came up to
24:50 - me and my college professor was like he
24:54 - came up to me and he was like hey you
24:56 - know can you help me with my career and
25:01 - he started helping me asking me for
25:03 - advice on tips for career questions and
25:06 - when my professor started asking you for
25:08 - career advice that's the moment I knew I
25:10 - had to kind of leave college because I
25:14 - was in college and I figured out how to
25:16 - freelance on the side and then grow my
25:18 - income really really fast over a period
25:21 - of one year and then I taught you know

26:51 - road now we'll go deep into building
26:55 - your personal roadmap for making
26:57 - $100,000 a year as a JavaScript
26:59 - developer on day 5 of our live
27:01 - training now quick question who would be

27:10 - $100,000 a year I hope you are but for
27:14 - now let's figure out why you want to
27:16 - become a JavaScript developer sounds

27:21 - comment below what are three things more
27:23 - important to you than money let me know
27:25 - that right now why are you trying to
27:28 - learn coding what are things that are
27:31 - more important to you than money because
27:32 - if that's the only important thing guess
27:34 - what now gonna get very far
27:38 - awesome everybody's saying Miriam is
27:40 - saying I'm in Florence's I'm in Vignesh
27:42 - Abhishek Rishi Aaron yes let's go Karl

28:04 - this is awesome that those things are
28:05 - important to you guys right like
28:06 - family's important to you it sounds like
28:08 - freedom is important to you guys being
28:12 - happy job security some of you guys are
28:14 - saying some of you guys are saying being
28:15 - able to travel that's important cool now
28:19 - let's move on to another thing so make
28:22 - sure you guys got that down right for
28:25 - yourself the three things that are
28:26 - important for you okay make sure you got
28:27 - them down okay now let's move on to the
28:31 - next part so now I want you to comment
28:33 - below and let me know what can making
28:35 - money as a JavaScript developer help you
28:37 - achieve in your life so if you could
28:39 - make an extra $500 a month from
28:41 - JavaScript or maybe you could make
28:44 - $1,000 a month from JavaScript or 3,000
28:47 - or 5,000 or 10,000 doesn't matter but
28:50 - just talk to me about what can that help
28:52 - you achieve in your life could it help
28:54 - you achieve financial freedom could it
28:57 - help you support your family and now you
29:00 - can pay their bills what specific
29:02 - because the more specific we can get the
29:04 - more likely we are to be able to achieve
29:06 - our goals right or get closer to them
29:07 - and would you be able to have more time
29:10 - to spend with your loved ones would it
29:12 - allow you to do that Jeremias saying a
29:14 - support
29:14 - my family want to travel flexibility
29:16 - family music helping people financial
29:19 - security love that
29:21 - Isak opportunity freedom create new
29:23 - solutions for problems dope okay now
29:28 - let's figure out now what we're gonna do
29:30 - okay this is an important part and we're
29:32 - gonna figure this out together right now
29:33 - guys
29:33 - so we got this part now we have why
29:37 - you're trying to learn to code what are
29:38 - the three most important things to you
29:40 - now we're getting to what you would do
29:42 - with the money that you make as a
29:43 - JavaScript developer and I'm just gonna
29:47 - take a quick pause here to say like you
29:50 - might think this is not important and
29:52 - you might think oh this is actually like
29:54 - random stuff and how does this have what
29:55 - does this have to do with JavaScript
29:56 - here's the thing once you have your Y
30:00 - set and strongly you can be coding for
30:02 - the next 12 months 24 months five years
30:04 - ten years it doesn't matter but what's
30:07 - gonna get you through those five years
30:09 - is what we talked about today what we
30:10 - talked about right now if you don't have
30:12 - this I just see people quitting again
30:14 - and again and again and again and you
30:16 - know we end up being the same that same
30:18 - person who like codes for three months
30:20 - and is stuck in tutorial purgatory and
30:22 - isn't in code Kadim II and free code
30:24 - camp and team treehouse and Udacity and
30:28 - Coursera and edex and all of this stuff
30:30 - and then boom they just find themselves
30:33 - confused and then they quit coding the
30:35 - difference between that person who quits
30:37 - and the person who will keep going is
30:39 - what we're doing right now so this is
30:43 - why we're doing this okay hope that
30:44 - makes sense now
30:49 - what we want to do is let's figure out
30:50 - your income goals okay so let's figure
30:53 - out engine goals how much income do you
30:55 - want to make per month now don't let me
30:56 - put thoughts into your mind right like
30:58 - for example I can be like oh my god you
31:00 - want to make ten thousand hundred
31:02 - thousand a month doesn't matter what I
31:04 - think what's important to you what will
31:07 - give you the lifestyle that you're
31:08 - looking for so come up with a number
31:11 - that's specific and good to you
31:12 - something that's you want to think
31:14 - optimistic but you're not thinking I'm
31:16 - gonna make a billion dollars this year
31:17 - or $1,000,000 something that you know in
31:20 - the next 12 months you could see
31:21 - yourself doing and it's a goal that you
31:23 - could actually start to strive for and
31:25 - see it as a reality so
31:28 - like from coding if you were to make an
31:30 - extra thousand dollars a month Slyke is
31:32 - that what you want your goal to be do
31:34 - you want it to be an extra $5,000 a
31:36 - month or $10,000 a month like what is it
31:39 - for you that makes you happy some
31:41 - realistic numbers I've seen some people
31:42 - they're like okay if I make 2,400 ollars
31:44 - a month I'm happy like it could pay for
31:46 - my rent my car my dis dad and the other
31:48 - thing and I'm good
31:49 - so what does that look like for you
31:51 - people are saying 3,500 a month 500 a
31:53 - month six thousand and one Joseph says
31:55 - three thousand a month
31:56 - awesome says 10k gene says four K for
32:00 - him says five Hugo says $13,000 a month
32:02 - Sakura says ten thousand okay cool so
32:06 - now what I want you to do
32:07 - Zachary says 87,000 and something number
32:10 - eighty seven thousand dollars a year
32:11 - okay so now these numbers that you guys
32:16 - have gone please make sure that you have
32:17 - a notebook or something next see that
32:19 - you could write this down and or maybe
32:21 - your phone anything where you can
32:22 - actually take these notes and write so
32:24 - you got your three most important things
32:26 - that are important to you than money you
32:27 - got your what you would do with the
32:29 - money you make and now you got how much
32:31 - money you want to make once we have
32:33 - those goals precisely set in guys will
32:36 - be able to do reverse engineering from
32:38 - that so on the left fifth day this
32:41 - information is gonna be vital for you
32:42 - because when we started develop that
32:44 - roadmap for you it has to be
32:46 - personalized and the only way it can get
32:48 - personalized is from what we're gonna do
32:50 - today so have these notes take them down
32:53 - and even tag me in them okay take a
32:55 - screenshot and tag me at clever Kazi
32:57 - okay CLE ve are clever QA Z icon Z and
33:01 - tag me on Instagram and I'll repost you
33:03 - and I'd love to love to see what you're
33:05 - up to now we're gonna move on to the
33:08 - next thing
33:08 - okay everybody cool with this okay I'm
33:11 - gonna move on now boom Xavier says I got
33:15 - notion for note keeping nice I love
33:17 - notion but sometimes it starts to break
33:19 - when you have a lot of text sent which
33:20 - is weird Danielle says now we're talking
33:22 - beautiful now I have a question for you
33:25 - guys
33:25 - do you want to freelance or full-time so
33:29 - this part is up to you okay which one do
33:32 - you want more so I'll give you guys
33:34 - different scenarios okay neither is bad
33:36 - like my whole life I kind of was like
33:38 - freelance or you suck I don't really
33:41 - think that's true anymore it really
33:42 - depends on your personality type right
33:44 - so for those of you who value security
33:46 - more probably full time is gonna be
33:48 - better for you and for those of you who
33:50 - really care about being your own boss
33:51 - and all that freelance
33:53 - but just remember freelance there's
33:56 - inherently a higher amount of risk
33:57 - because you're the one who has to get
34:00 - clients okay but the benefits are you
34:03 - get to be your own boss you get to have
34:04 - multiple clients they're not just
34:05 - dependent on one full-time on the other
34:08 - hand now you can you're you know you're
34:10 - maybe looking to land a dream job at a
34:12 - Fang company like Netflix Google or
34:14 - whatnot okay so I'm seeing a lot of
34:16 - freelance I'm seeing a lot of full-time
34:17 - it almost seems like it's going both
34:19 - ways maybe I should start a poll hmm let
34:24 - me actually do that right now give me
34:25 - one second guys let's see if I can get
34:28 - fancy with this without breaking
34:29 - anything cuz that would suck so let's
34:33 - see I hope I don't break anything really
34:35 - really hope really really hope I don't
34:37 - break anything stream health yeah I
34:44 - don't think I'm gonna make a poll I just
34:45 - have I just have a feeling something's
34:47 - gonna break and it's gonna suck and the
34:49 - live stream is gonna end and I would
34:52 - rather not take that risk let's keep
34:55 - going guys alright so um overall the
34:59 - sense that I've gone is you guys are in
35:01 - the middle of both all right you guys
35:03 - want to do both that's totally fine okay
35:05 - I'll just tell you personally for me I
35:08 - wanted to do freelancing but don't let
35:10 - that restrict you okay both are good
35:12 - areas it just depends on your
35:14 - personality type cool so now make sure
35:20 - you have this written down somewhere too
35:21 - because we're really creating a custom
35:23 - profile for you right now and what your
35:26 - future looks like now let's talk about
35:29 - like why javascript right so what's so
35:31 - crazy about javascript why should you
35:33 - learn it why does it matter now
35:37 - javascript is a super popular language
35:40 - right so popularity is absolutely insane
35:42 - so we're gonna get just a little bit
35:44 - into that so here's javascript and boom
35:47 - you can build all kinds of things so on
35:48 - Stack Overflow it got number one right
35:51 - on all respondents it's the most popular
35:53 - technology
35:55 - now you can build web apps like Facebook
35:57 - you can build Android apps like the
36:00 - Tesla app with JavaScript or you can
36:03 - build server side apps like Netflix is
36:05 - that pretty cool what do you guys think
36:08 - that awesome you would want to make
36:10 - something like Facebook Tesla app or
36:13 - Netflix I think so I think that'd be
36:15 - pretty dope now let's talk about job
36:18 - opportunities and salary with JavaScript
36:21 - okay so what does that really look like
36:23 - so JavaScript developers salaries my
36:25 - experience in the US now don't let the
36:28 - u.s. part scare you guys away guys
36:30 - because I know a lot of you are not in
36:32 - the US and that's okay just remember
36:35 - that you can work remotely from your own
36:38 - country in u.s. or some kind of Western
36:41 - market like Germany or some other
36:43 - country right like there you're much
36:45 - more likely to get paid a higher amount
36:47 - like for example if you're somebody
36:49 - who's living in a living in Philippines
36:52 - or Macedonia or India or whatnot just
36:56 - know that in your own country might not
36:59 - get paid that much but if you figure out
37:01 - a way to get into the US market and work
37:02 - remotely which is not that hard these
37:04 - salaries are available potentially for
37:06 - every single one of you guys okay so
37:08 - just be aware of that and here the
37:12 - salaries so in 2020 the salary for
37:15 - somebody with even less than one year of
37:17 - experience is actually look at this
37:19 - freaking $75,000 guys a year isn't that
37:23 - cool seventy-five thousand dollars a
37:25 - year with less than one year of
37:27 - experience of course it doesn't mean you
37:29 - can just go in there and suck you have
37:31 - to work hard during that one year or
37:33 - less but if you get a job this is
37:36 - actually very possible for you here of
37:39 - JavaScript jobs that are available right
37:41 - now on indeed.com
37:42 - about 45,000 jobs and this is the salary
37:46 - range so if you actually look at it
37:48 - seventy-five thousand plus ninety five
37:50 - thousand plus so the jobs are all there
37:53 - for you okay this is not the matter of
37:55 - whether it exists or not it's just a
37:56 - matter of you sticking with it and
37:59 - improving your skill set all right and
38:03 - if you want to freelance
38:04 - here are 8,000 jobs that are available
38:06 - right this second on up work you can go
38:08 - on up work and actually start pulling
38:10 - jobs from there okay and in our courses
38:12 - we teach you actually like in this five
38:14 - day challenge we actually pulled a
38:17 - Google Maps job that's worth five
38:19 - thousand seven hundred ollars from up
38:21 - work and we're gonna build it live
38:23 - together so I hope you think that's
38:25 - pretty freakin amazing alright so this
38:31 - is what I was talking about earlier US
38:32 - Canada Germany United Kingdom you guys
38:35 - can get in these markets ok JavaScript
38:37 - as a JavaScript developer and yes in USA
38:40 - you might be looking to make on average
38:42 - the most amount of money per month about
38:43 - six thousand a month whereas Canada and
38:46 - Germany you're looking at about four
38:47 - thousand a month and United Kingdom 3000
38:50 - so just keep in mind the world is really
38:52 - really massive and it doesn't matter
38:53 - what country you're in even your own
38:56 - country in relative terms will pay you
38:58 - really good for being a developer but if
39:00 - you can get into these markets doesn't
39:02 - matter what country you're from then
39:04 - you're looking to make a really good
39:06 - amount of money okay all right now you
39:10 - might be like that's all great Kazi but
39:12 - what about after this kovat nineteen
39:14 - coronavirus thing so I hope Deena's
39:16 - story gave you some insight but let's go
39:19 - a little bit deeper into this okay like
39:21 - you guys saw Deena landed a job in the
39:23 - middle of Kovac 19 you guys saw you guys
39:26 - remember Greg when I showed you guys
39:27 - Greg just a little bit ago like Greg
39:29 - landed clients in the middle of this so
39:32 - it's possible but here's something I was
39:35 - reading recently which was published on
39:36 - March 22nd and here a hundred developer
39:39 - jobs and companies still hiring during

41:21 - incredibly exciting space so this is
41:22 - just to show you guys that possibilities
41:24 - and it exists Disney is looking for a
41:26 - JavaScript developer so they're actually
41:29 - looking for a JavaScript developer of
41:30 - all experiences at Disney convertkit
41:33 - which is a software that I used to send
41:35 - you guys emails all the time okay
41:37 - they're looking for JavaScript
41:39 - developers right now okay so now the
41:42 - question maybe you're still asking is
41:45 - hey what can you really do with
41:46 - JavaScript so I've shown you guys you
41:48 - can build web apps you can build mobile
41:50 - apps you can build server apps like
41:52 - Netflix web apps like Facebook like
41:54 - Tesla I've shown you guys like kovat 19
41:57 - apps and the Google Maps projects or
41:58 - students have built but like here's a
42:01 - beatbox app rights on the left hand side
42:03 - you have a total waterfront we're not
42:04 - gonna look at the live demo of this but
42:06 - I'm just gonna show you guys and on the
42:07 - left hand side you got the wireframe and
42:09 - this was like when we were starting the
42:11 - app and on the right hand side we have a
42:13 - finished version of the app okay and a
42:17 - if you want to learn how to build a
42:19 - beatbox app just remember we build it in
42:21 - our profit with JavaScript course which
42:23 - will actually be announcing and
42:25 - launching next week so I hope you guys
42:27 - are excited about this profit JavaScript
42:28 - course but this is of course if you want
42:32 - to take your knowledge to a deeper level
42:33 - okay but for now if you guys are in the
42:35 - ciao
42:36 - you guys don't need the course you guys
42:37 - can just follow along for now alright so
42:40 - we build this entire thing out you can
42:42 - see that now here's one another thing
42:44 - you could do with JavaScript so here's a
42:46 - Twitter wireframe on the left hand side
42:48 - and on the right hand side here's a
42:52 - Twitter mock-up okay wouldn't that be
42:54 - cool who would think that would be
42:56 - really cool if you could go from this
42:57 - thing on the left hand side to a fully
42:59 - working app of Twitter on the right hand
43:02 - side like this but that kind of like
43:04 - blow your mind you'll be like oh my god
43:06 - you could do it just with JavaScript oh
43:08 - my god mom look at this I'm so proud of
43:09 - myself this will be crazy right here so
43:16 - here's a Twitter clone and again if you
43:20 - want to learn how to build this we build
43:22 - it in a JavaScript course then you can
43:24 - go like module by module and learn every
43:26 - technical detail and then be able to put
43:28 - it together put it on your resume and be
43:31 - super fancy and you know get hired and
43:33 - then here's a Google Maps wireframe okay
43:36 - so who's excited about building a Google
43:38 - Maps app we're gonna be building this in
43:40 - this challenge
43:42 - freaking live guys so on the left hand
43:45 - side we have a store locator right and
43:47 - on the right hand side check this out we
43:51 - got the Google Maps app so boom you go
43:55 - from wireframe to on the right hand side
43:57 - the final version cool Leslie says it's
44:00 - so cool shams Joe a new awesome loving
44:05 - this guy's I love your guys's energy all
44:08 - right let's keep going I don't know why
44:11 - one put one person put angry face on
44:13 - it's just throwing me off it's like one
44:15 - person out of all of these people is
44:16 - angry at me but you know I hope the rest
44:18 - of you guys are liking this that's
44:21 - really missing letting yeah I gotta like
44:26 - play some songs anyways let's keep going
44:28 - guys alright so hope hopefully most of
44:32 - you guys are liking this besides that
44:34 - one person who's angry and maybe we can
44:37 - win them over to it by the end of this
44:40 - alright Google Maps project so this is a
44:42 - Google Maps project that you guys will
44:44 - build and it will be live and you guys
44:46 - will have hosted it online and people
44:48 - can type
44:49 - the freakin thing and use your app like
44:51 - it will be crazy like you'll be able to
44:53 - share with anybody you'll be able to
44:55 - play around with it you'll have it on
44:56 - your portfolio it's awesome okay and
44:59 - just want to say to you guys you know I
45:01 - get you guys are hyped and pumped just
45:03 - remember it might be difficult when
45:06 - you're working on this and you'll be
45:07 - like this doesn't feel like a beginner
45:09 - project oh my god
45:10 - well here's the thing for now just
45:14 - follow along build it it will make sense
45:16 - later as you go and specially once you
45:19 - have build it but what we want to do
45:20 - with you guys and give you guys an
45:22 - amazing experience right where you can
45:24 - build something that's real and
45:26 - real-world so even if you're a beginner
45:27 - and you feel like man I'm falling behind
45:29 - just work to catch up even if you have
45:31 - to copy paste code to put stuff together
45:33 - just get it working cuz in my experience
45:36 - the best way to learn coding is just to
45:38 - get in there and get your hands dirty
45:39 - okay just play with it have fun honestly
45:43 - I just think that's how you get good you
45:45 - don't get good by just like constantly
45:47 - learning theory forever you get good in
45:50 - my opinion by getting in there
45:53 - practicing breaking things it's kind of
45:54 - the equivalent of like if I want to
45:56 - teach you soccer and I just kept giving
45:58 - you lessons on a chalkboard
46:00 - instead of like getting you to kick a
46:02 - soccer ball right so what we're trying
46:03 - to do here is just getting you to kick a
46:05 - soccer ball get used to it and then you
46:07 - can learn the technical details a lot
46:09 - later cool all right
46:11 - so just have that mentally prepared in
46:13 - your mind so when you feel like giving
46:15 - up you're like no no I remember cause he
46:16 - told me don't give up right now just
46:18 - work through this you guys with me so
46:20 - far you promise you won't quit on me
46:22 - right Drive this challenge we work
46:24 - really hard to put this together for you
46:25 - we really want you to complete it and
46:27 - have it on your portfolio okay so please
46:29 - stick with us and keep going love your
46:31 - face alright let's get back to it all
46:36 - right I'm loving your guys's energy by
46:38 - the way alright so we're gonna build as
46:40 - Google Maps project it's worth fifty
46:42 - seven hundred dollars on up work and
46:44 - you'll be building this on day two day
46:46 - three and day four of the live
46:49 - JavaScript developer challenge who's
46:50 - excited about this alan says I promise
46:52 - jim says yes curtis says i cross my
46:55 - heart beautiful love that all right
46:59 - let's go so we got the store locator
47:02 - this is what you guys are gonna build it
47:03 - memory guys this is a real project not a
47:05 - dummy project not a baby project it's a
47:08 - real project that's worth fifty seven
47:10 - hundred from up work that we brought
47:13 - down and now you get to build it cool so
47:16 - kinda as real-world as it gets okay so
47:19 - we try to make it exciting and
47:20 - real-world combined the two boom you get
47:23 - clever programmer another thing I want
47:26 - to share with you guys alright I know
47:29 - that we're going we're covering so much
47:30 - but are you guys excited you guys want
47:32 - me to cover more value bomb stuff even
47:34 - though it might hurt your head but like
47:35 - I just have so much stuff prepared guys
47:38 - I just want to keep going I just want to
47:39 - give you guys I just want to give as
47:41 - much as possible so if that's cool with
47:43 - you guys I'm gonna keep going then
47:45 - alright you guys are saying go love it
47:47 - alright so the modern JavaScript
47:50 - developer pyramid of wealth so what is
47:53 - this this is something that actually my
47:58 - girlfriend actually helped me turn into
48:00 - a diagram because this was in my head
48:03 - for a really long time but I couldn't
48:04 - ever like get it into a diagram so now
48:08 - what we have done is I kind of shared
48:10 - this with her and we were trying to
48:12 - whiteboard it on that whiteboard over
48:14 - the big whiteboard right behind me and I
48:16 - was like ah my head hurts how do I do
48:18 - this and then finally she like started
48:21 - drawing like she's like oh like a
48:23 - pyramid right and then building it out
48:24 - and finally she built and I'm like this
48:28 - is it this is everything that I've been
48:29 - trying to explain for the last like
48:31 - three or four years and now it's just in
48:33 - one page and this is quite possible and
48:36 - the most valuable things for a developer
48:38 - to have like as a developer if I could
48:40 - get hands on the thing that I'm about to
48:42 - show you right now I would literally
48:44 - have it printed on my freaking wall and
48:46 - on my phone screen and I'll just look at
48:48 - this every single day because it
48:50 - literally gives you the step by step of
48:52 - how you want to get to where you want to
48:55 - get to and how you can increase your
48:57 - income as well okay so some numbers I'm
49:03 - gonna share with you in here they're
49:04 - like a little high so it might be
49:07 - confusing to you might be like oh my god
49:08 - these numbers look too high they're like
49:10 - not believable but I just want you to
49:12 - think relatively I just put them there
49:15 - to simplify math and just
49:17 - explain how this works okay now I took
49:19 - this to making ten fifteen thousand
49:22 - dollars a month myself you could take
49:24 - this to any level you want you want to
49:25 - take this to making one thousand a month
49:27 - you can do that you want to take this
49:28 - time making 10k a month you could do
49:30 - that okay with enough hard work of
49:32 - course so let's get into this so number
49:35 - one thing that you want to do is of
49:38 - course you want to learn
49:40 - alright that's non-negotiable so step
49:42 - one of the pyramid right here is learn
49:44 - the technical coding skills to become a
49:47 - modern JavaScript developer okay
49:50 - no my girlfriend is actually a
49:51 - professional boxer she's not a developer
49:53 - but she's really really good visually
49:55 - and understands how things work so it's
49:57 - helpful for me to speak to her cuz she's
50:00 - not so like into coding so then if she
50:04 - says that an idea makes sense then it's
50:06 - like okay if it makes sense that
50:08 - somebody who's not in the coding world
50:09 - then oh my god it would make so much
50:11 - sense to like majority of the people
50:13 - that look at it right so it's really
50:15 - about taking an idea and simplifying it
50:17 - as much as humanly possible cool all
50:22 - right
50:22 - so step one learn alright this is the
50:25 - first step that you guys are going to be
50:26 - doing then step two here's what I
50:29 - recommend for you guys okay so if you
50:31 - are a so this is what I recommend coach
50:34 - teach coding to other people okay and
50:37 - the required skill level for this is
50:40 - beginner and actually the time to build
50:42 - a stream of income of up to three
50:45 - thousand dollars a month right here it
50:48 - will take you about one to three months
50:49 - so even if you're a complete beginner
50:51 - right now if you actually spend one to
50:55 - two months just diving in hardcore and
50:57 - learning JavaScript and coding and
50:59 - building projects and even following
51:00 - this you guys can actually start going
51:04 - and getting clients where you're
51:06 - teaching them coding this is the crazy
51:08 - thing that we saw in the despite a
51:11 - challenge that we did last month we had
51:12 - the students going like start
51:14 - implementing the strategy or they
51:16 - started learning coding and then started
51:18 - going getting clients and this started
51:20 - getting people who were just like one
51:21 - step behind them so this might seem like
51:25 - a really intimidating thing how can I
51:26 - teach coding how can I teach this why
51:28 - would somebody pay me you
51:30 - have to be one step ahead of that person
51:33 - most people the truth is don't even know
51:35 - how to run one line of JavaScript code
51:37 - and like run it they don't even know you
51:39 - can run it in a browser so if you can be
51:42 - one step ahead of them you can actually
51:44 - charge them and teach them does that
51:46 - make sense to you guys think of it like
51:49 - remember in math class when you might
51:51 - have been younger and like the teacher
51:54 - was explaining something to you and you
51:56 - were just like man I'm so confused this
51:57 - makes no sense and then instead you went
52:00 - to like a friend of yours and that
52:01 - friend taught you that same concept but
52:04 - it's so much easier and you understand
52:05 - you know like thank God well is it
52:08 - because your friend is better than your
52:09 - teacher no right it's because your
52:13 - friend just explains to you in a better
52:15 - way because it's more relatable but the
52:17 - teacher is way more advanced than your
52:19 - friend so what I'm saying is you just
52:21 - have to be your friend to teach somebody
52:22 - else you don't have to be at the level
52:24 - of the teacher hopefully that makes
52:25 - sense
52:26 - cool so you guys can actually do this
52:28 - and be learning coding while making
52:31 - money at the same time this was one of
52:32 - the biggest secrets that I found when I
52:34 - was doing I was growing my career and
52:38 - whatever you teach and another benefit
52:40 - for teaching right how many times does
52:41 - this happen to you guys where you teach
52:43 - a concept to somebody else and when you
52:45 - teach it to them you become better at it
52:47 - you guys know what I'm talking about
52:49 - like literally your skill set improves
52:51 - so freaking much because you were
52:53 - teaching somebody else and things start
52:54 - to make sense so that's kind of how I
52:57 - look at this where you teach other
53:00 - people you become good and then you
53:02 - start to make money in the first one to
53:04 - three months hopefully this makes sense
53:06 - to you guys okay and you could be making
53:09 - $3,000 a month as early as one your
53:13 - first one to two months of coding okay
53:16 - this is like a little bit controversial
53:18 - advice where people all my god that's
53:20 - impossible you can never do this oh we
53:24 - have tons of students that are doing
53:25 - this at clever programmer like so many
53:28 - students I did this when I started and I
53:31 - promise you you'll be able to do this as
53:33 - well you just have to make sure you
53:34 - complete step one really well alright
53:37 - then what I recommend
53:39 - step three for you right so step one you
53:42 - can be a beginner and be able to
53:43 - actually build a strain
53:44 - of income some of you getting this is
53:46 - making sense okay awesome love it here's
53:48 - step three for you okay the this is
53:51 - where I recommend you guys freelance so
53:53 - instead of just going straight from
53:54 - learning coding and trying to get a job
53:56 - which is really really hard what I
53:57 - recommend is then you coach and you
54:00 - build a stream of income and then you go
54:02 - freelance as step three so freelance
54:04 - means work for clients independently the
54:08 - required skill level is intermediate so
54:11 - you don't actually have to be like a
54:12 - super Pro you could actually be
54:14 - intermediate skill level and do
54:16 - freelancing and the time to build this
54:18 - stream of income is actually four to
54:20 - twelve months and what I say is like
54:24 - your goal should be to hit five thousand
54:26 - dollars a month from freelancing okay
54:29 - who would be excited to make five
54:32 - thousand dollars a month from
54:33 - freelancing with JavaScript would you be
54:36 - mind blown by that oh my god that'd be
54:38 - so cool but here's a really cool part so
54:40 - because it's a pyramid it like stacks on
54:42 - top of each other you're making you're
54:45 - really making three thousand dollars a
54:46 - month from coaching on top of which
54:49 - you're making five thousand dollars a
54:50 - month from freelancing if you don't let
54:53 - go of any of your coaching clients
54:54 - meaning what does that mean you're
54:57 - looking to make how much per month if
54:59 - you execute this really really well and
55:02 - put in the work you're looking to make
55:03 - about eight grand a month from this
55:05 - strategy alone okay
55:09 - just really insane amount of execution
55:11 - is required on your end but it's a very
55:13 - very possible path cool a lot of tacos
55:17 - and then step four is what I recommend
55:19 - is step four you really start looking
55:21 - for a full-time job if you want to for
55:23 - me there was never any step for oh just
55:25 - step two and three and I just scale this
55:27 - up to like making over a hundred grand a
55:29 - year just these two steps okay even just
55:33 - with coaching you can come pretty close
55:34 - to making six figures they're a bunch of
55:37 - people who are just teaching coding and
55:39 - they're making too close to six figures
55:40 - okay the tons of online platforms
55:42 - likewise ant take lessons people per
55:47 - hour Facebook groups you can go to and
55:49 - get clients from Instagram groups that
55:51 - are about coding beginner coding you can
55:52 - get clients from ton of stuff will get
55:54 - really deep into it on the last day I
55:56 - won't get too deep into it now
55:58 - but just high-level so last step is job
56:02 - okay this is where you work full-time as
56:04 - a developer the required skill level I
56:07 - say for this is advanced and the time to
56:11 - build this stream of income you're
56:12 - really looking at 12 to 24 months so one
56:15 - to two years of timeline alright but
56:19 - instead of just trying to go for a job
56:21 - and doing nothing else I recommend you
56:23 - coach then on top of that you build
56:26 - another stream of income freelance now
56:28 - you have two streams of income on top of
56:30 - that you can get a job okay so now you
56:34 - have essentially three streams of income
56:36 - if you want it but if you want to give
56:39 - up coaching and freelancing once you get
56:41 - a job you could do that too okay and
56:43 - with job you're looking to make seven
56:45 - thousand dollars a month or more if
56:47 - you're working full-time as a JavaScript
56:50 - developer okay average developer salary
56:52 - about six to seven grand a month you
56:55 - know at least in the United States all
56:57 - right so if you execute this perfectly
57:02 - and you do all of the steps and you
57:04 - stack and you're just working overtime
57:06 - and doing all of this your income
57:08 - potential is $15,000 a month which again
57:12 - I know it sounds really really crazy and
57:14 - insane but it's definitely very very
57:17 - possible or you could just be like hey I
57:19 - don't want to do all of this I can just
57:21 - like you can get rid of the freelancing
57:23 - and you can get rid of the coaching and
57:25 - you can just focus on the job does that
57:28 - make sense or you can just focus on
57:31 - freelancing and this is where your
57:33 - personal goal comes in like do you need
57:35 - to make 15 grand a month
57:36 - probably not maybe you just need to make
57:38 - $2,400 a month maybe you just need to
57:40 - make thousand dollars extra per month
57:43 - right so really depends up to you okay
57:47 - does this make sense to you guys I'm
57:48 - about to move on okay if you do all four
57:51 - steps yet Trey you will have no life but
57:53 - it could be pretty worth it
57:55 - so now if you guys want to take a photo
57:57 - of this now would be the time and I will
57:59 - move on from this in five four three two
58:03 - one all right moving on cool now there
58:09 - are seven most important
58:11 - Abbot's to get you there okay so you're
58:14 - really looking at like you want to
58:16 - develop things like fun hard work and
58:19 - I'm gonna now I'm gonna start going
58:21 - rapid-fire guys and I'm gonna just speed
58:23 - it up a lot just because I want to be
58:24 - sensitive of your guys it's time and and
58:26 - then maybe we can even get into Q&A s at
58:28 - the end of it okay so fun is important
58:32 - if you're not having fun you're really
58:34 - not gonna go far with coding or it's
58:36 - gonna be really really difficult I see
58:38 - some people just brutally working their
58:41 - way through it and they always look
58:42 - miserable it's like do you not want to
58:44 - be happy like don't code if it's not
58:47 - gonna make you happy right ultimately
58:49 - you should be doing something that
58:50 - doesn't feel like work so for me coding
58:53 - literally always felt like playing a
58:55 - video game and then I'm just like what's
58:58 - wrong with people are paying me to play
59:00 - a video game like I would pay our coding
59:04 - is so fun I want to pay people to be
59:06 - able to work for them but if you do it
59:09 - the right way people will pay you okay
59:12 - so make sure fun is there for you all
59:15 - right
59:16 - hard work is of course really really
59:20 - important being patient is important
59:22 - teamwork communication and some things I
59:25 - want to highlight is always you want to
59:27 - be learning and taking initiative okay
59:29 - always always be learning like as a
59:31 - developer you're learning never ends and
59:33 - you should actually love learning that's
59:35 - one of your best skills here's one
59:39 - student from our profit JavaScript
59:40 - community Carl he put it really really
59:42 - well he said so mindset is key okay and
59:46 - he goes hey Jackson just dive in so
59:50 - Jackson was somebody who like needed
59:51 - help and was struggling with something
59:53 - so cause like hey Jackson just dive in
59:56 - ask for help and review the material
59:58 - until you internalize it in addition to
60:01 - the pwj program I registered for the
60:03 - JavaScript challenge I'm a newbie myself
60:05 - but do not let fear become a block this

60:11 - the target in sight and do not allow
60:13 - mundane disruptions and distractions

60:24 - and you will materializer in ten
60:25 - objective you can feel like quitting and
60:28 - that's okay just don't quit and one more
60:32 - thing stay away from negative people

64:12 - so now I want to just kind of I'm gonna
64:14 - start skimming through some of this
64:15 - stuff right so now after one to two
64:17 - months of solid training and building up
64:19 - your technical JavaScript skills guys
64:21 - now you're gonna be ready to develop a
64:23 - new stream of income okay so you
64:24 - remember this learn step then the next
64:26 - step is coaching so we're gonna help you
64:29 - with the learn step even in this live
64:30 - training okay and after one to two
64:35 - months for you personally what your plan
64:37 - will look like is now you're ready to
64:38 - actually start making an income with
64:40 - coding okay so pillar number one of your
64:43 - income streams I remember it it was
64:45 - coaching freelancing and then getting a
64:47 - full-time job right hopefully you guys
64:48 - remember that so step one coaching to
64:50 - beginners so here we have some Stu
64:53 - in our courses that are landing these
64:55 - clients okay subdue is one of our
64:57 - students and he closed the student for
65:00 - $850 for 12 calls that comes out to be
65:03 - about $71 an hour
65:04 - so wouldn't that be cool for you if you
65:07 - learned some JavaScript skills for one
65:09 - months and then you went and you got
65:12 - another client that you could teach
65:13 - JavaScript coding to because it's a
65:15 - valuable skill set that people want to
65:17 - learn and people specially now because
65:20 - the Cova 19 everybody wants to learn
65:22 - coding okay it's a valuable skill set
65:24 - and you could charge them 70 dollars an
65:26 - hour and if you couldn't even charge
65:27 - them 70 what if you could just charge
65:29 - them 50 what if you get just charged in
65:30 - thirty five or twenty five or $15 an
65:32 - hour
65:33 - wouldn't that be freaking amazing but
65:35 - how amazing would this be all right
65:37 - Michael lecompt who's one of our
65:39 - students he landed a client for $40 an
65:43 - hour okay he was like super pumped about
65:45 - that and were pumped for him he he
65:47 - landed multiple clients actually just in
65:49 - one week okay Greg and remember guys we
65:52 - showed you Greg earlier Greg landed a
65:54 - client during this and here's what Greg
65:57 - did right he learned the technical
65:58 - coding skills something that you might
66:00 - want to do at this point then he used
66:03 - online platforms to land clients who
66:05 - were beginners in JavaScript in his
66:07 - first month he actually landed a client
66:10 - yeah you can you guys can record this if
66:12 - you guys want somehow now in our program
66:14 - profit with JavaScript we go into
66:17 - extreme detail on helping you build up
66:19 - your technical coding skills and
66:21 - teaching you how to land clients and
66:24 - jobs so who's excited who would be
66:27 - excited if you got this training from me
66:29 - nas directly where we not only give you
66:32 - the tech skills but literally showed you
66:34 - how to land clients and guided you
66:36 - through that process would you be
66:39 - excited would that be something that's
66:41 - actually valuable for you and bring
66:43 - value to your life so if that's
66:47 - something that would be valuable to you
66:49 - I just want you to keep it in your mind
66:50 - that you know take as much value from
66:53 - this challenge as you possibly and
66:55 - humanly can but in a week when we launch
66:58 - the course you might want to look into
66:59 - and look for our profit JavaScript
67:02 - course okay because like if you want to
67:03 - go really deep we can go really deep
67:06 - later
67:07 - cool so let's keep going with this all
67:11 - right your second pillar of income is
67:13 - gonna be freelancing as a JavaScript
67:15 - developer okay and remember freelancing
67:17 - is a huge freaking economy all right
67:20 - there's a three point seven trillion
67:22 - dollar global gig economy and it's only
67:25 - growing every single year okay it's one
67:27 - point two eight trillion just in the US
67:29 - alone so you can grab a piece of that
67:32 - economy it's tiny it's a drop in the
67:34 - ocean so don't think like oh my god
67:36 - there's too much competition I can never
67:38 - become a developer that's false it's
67:40 - just all drops in the ocean okay so
67:42 - don't let that like thing come in your
67:44 - mind cool Radian says I can I still
67:48 - purchase profit javascript yeah if you
67:50 - want to jump in right now you're welcome
67:52 - to jump in and join the course that's
67:54 - totally fine too or if you just want to
67:56 - like focus on the challenge for now you
67:58 - can do that as well
67:59 - it's up to you all right and here's our
68:04 - student nazar who landed a hundred and
68:06 - ten thousand dollar contract with
68:08 - javascript so this was pretty freakin
68:09 - crazy but I remember on the left hand
68:12 - side you guys can see this one day on
68:14 - slack this guy messages me and he's like
68:15 - holy cow he's like I just got a contract
68:18 - for one hundred and ten thousand dollars
68:19 - this is all thanks to you Kazi but i'll
68:22 - use javascript and 90% of the code
68:24 - armor-like it blew my mind I saw his
68:26 - blew my mind so you can see at the
68:28 - bottom I'm like yo NAS look what the
68:30 - like that is amazing
68:32 - so freelancing right is a different
68:35 - ballgame so you had coaching you can
68:38 - make income from it freelancing is all
68:39 - over the place but it's possible if
68:42 - you're somebody who's skilled and you
68:43 - put in the work you can actually land a
68:45 - pretty insane contract okay but again
68:47 - I'm just showing you guys I'm just
68:49 - sharing this with you guys to see what
68:50 - is possible and what is available so
68:53 - you're maybe more inspired and motivated
68:55 - to code because you know it's not like
68:57 - you're gonna just make a minimum-wage
68:59 - job you get to do something that's fun
69:00 - you get to make an impact in the world
69:02 - and you get to have freedom all right
69:05 - and then the last but not least the last
69:07 - step is you know of course you're trying

75:43 - and do that okay Ravi says is it going
75:50 - to be pure JavaScript or are recovering
75:53 - libraries and frameworks Oh Ravi great
75:55 - question mostly it's gonna be pure
75:57 - JavaScript there might be a little bit
75:59 - of jQuery but mostly we're gonna try to
76:01 - keep it as pure JavaScript as possible
76:03 - because pure JavaScript applies to all
76:06 - frameworks and everything so hopefully
76:09 - that answers your question
76:20 - mohamad asks when are you going to start
76:22 - a challenge for Python like this I
76:24 - imagine at some pool we got 869 viewers
76:27 - live yo what's up guys how's it going
76:30 - it's awesome so we're good not yeah well
76:33 - I'm thinking we're gonna do a Python
76:35 - challenge like this sometime soon
76:37 - you know probably a month or two months
76:38 - from now Amma says is it ok with bracket
76:47 - that I Oh code editor yeah if you're
76:49 - comfortable with it like if you have
76:50 - some other code editor of your choice
76:52 - and you're super comfortable that's okay
76:54 - just make sure that sometimes in vs code
76:56 - if we're going through and you get
76:57 - confused with the code editor or
77:00 - something along those lines then you're
77:02 - kind of on your own if you're using a
77:04 - different code editor but if you're more
77:06 - experienced it doesn't matter you can
77:08 - use whatever you want but if you're more
77:09 - of a beginner I recommend just like
77:11 - modeling the exact setup we're
77:13 - recommending for you like actually
77:15 - having Visual Studio code and all of the
77:17 - setup so you can just follow along
77:18 - without any problems Zach says how much
77:28 - free rein do we have updating the
77:29 - portfolio can I go crazy with CSS and
77:32 - personalization absolutely go crazy with
77:34 - it we're always looking to see like when
77:37 - it comes to like who's gonna win in the
77:38 - challenge and all of that write it for
77:40 - us and just depends your participation
77:43 - level how high is your participation are
77:45 - you like consistently commenting and
77:46 - engaging with the community are you
77:49 - making working on the projects that are
77:52 - awesome so if you're customizing and
77:54 - spending extra time into it
77:56 - personalizing and making it awesome will
77:58 - probably pick your project over a lot of
78:00 - other people's because we're seeing how
78:02 - much heart you're putting into it right
78:03 - because we go through everybody's
78:04 - projects and we take a look at it so
78:06 - yeah the more you do the better
78:13 - nice okay Wow lots of messages coming in
78:20 - guys Clary says Larry says funny
78:29 - I just finished a Paredes bharata's
78:31 - ginger beer nice this is a no this is
78:36 - boon de Burgh but it's delicious it's
78:40 - really really good
78:41 - a nice day asks is the course for all
78:48 - ages absolutely it is show beat says how
78:55 - do you tackle the feeling that I'm not
78:57 - capable enough for a certain task what's
79:01 - weird about that is like you just
79:02 - overcome it somehow meaning like
79:04 - sometimes you get help okay and be open
79:07 - to that so I'm really like I'm like I'll
79:11 - try as hard as I can and I'll keep
79:13 - working on it for a long time and then
79:15 - I'll try to get help if I can because
79:18 - there's somebody who knows the answer to
79:19 - it or somebody who knows how to figure
79:21 - it out get good at finding those people
79:24 - whether it looks like there it come in
79:26 - the shape of as friends or family
79:27 - members or maybe they come in the form
79:29 - of like you hiring somebody from code
79:31 - mentor that I owe paying them $70 an
79:33 - hour and like learning from them how to
79:36 - overcome the problem or the challenge
79:42 - okay Xavier says are one of the api's
79:46 - we're gonna learn REST API or graph QL
79:48 - in this one I I don't think you're gonna
79:52 - learn graph QL maybe some REST API I
79:55 - don't think there's a but it's just
79:57 - general API work with like um you know
80:01 - Google Maps API so you're gonna learn
80:02 - how to play around Google Maps API quite
80:05 - a bit so that's what you're gonna get to
80:07 - learn in this okay definitely no graph
80:09 - QL in this one
80:15 - Clayton says how realistic is it to
80:18 - complete your training and get a
80:19 - six-figure salary I'll tell you this
80:22 - like what's realistic is what we see
80:27 - works really well for people is they do
80:29 - a lot outside of just our training whoa
80:33 - somebody's yeah going crazy in the
80:36 - comments so for example what that means
80:38 - is you might join the program go through
80:40 - the entire training and then you like
80:43 - learn the fundamentals and you get
80:45 - started and you're making your first 500
80:47 - or 1500 or like three thousand dollars a
80:49 - month and then you use that momentum
80:51 - over like the next 12 months 24 months
80:54 - and then you're realistically looking at
80:56 - a you know high income whether it's from
80:59 - freelancing or a job and you're looking
81:00 - at like a six-figure salary but it's a
81:03 - long arduous process it's not so simple
81:05 - like you'll join the training in like
81:07 - four months later you're coming out
81:08 - making a hundred thousand dollars it
81:10 - doesn't work like that you will need to
81:13 - spend a tremendous amount of hours and
81:16 - putting in just brutal amount of work
81:18 - there's like no shortcut for that so the
81:21 - way that I scale to making a hundred
81:23 - thousand dollars in my first year was
81:25 - because I just worked like incredibly
81:28 - hard like meaning I was putting in 18
81:30 - hours a day into coding so in three
81:33 - months I was able to start scaling my
81:35 - income from five to ten thousand dollars
81:37 - a month from coding because my three to
81:40 - four months where somebody's like two
81:41 - years of coding just because not because
81:44 - I was a smart just because I spent that
81:46 - much time that like you might spend in
81:48 - two years I figured out how to spend it
81:50 - in three months does that make sense so
81:52 - it really depends on you if you are a
81:56 - psychopath like me and you just go
81:58 - all-in and you do nothing else and
82:01 - that's what you do for 10-15 hours a day
82:04 - you can be on that route and four or
82:08 - five months you know and like you're
82:10 - working really hard on your technical
82:12 - skills you're working really hard on the
82:14 - outreach of getting clients or jobs and
82:16 - lining up interviews yes you can get
82:18 - there but if you don't do that which my
82:20 - guess is most people most 90 percent of
82:24 - the people like average person never
82:26 - does that they're like oh it's the
82:28 - minimum number
82:28 - of hours do I need to spend into coding
82:30 - those are the people that don't really
82:32 - make it that far because they're just
82:34 - trying to spend five hours a week
82:35 - they're like yeah that's a good time
82:36 - five hours a week that's good well then
82:39 - they're looking to get the results in
82:40 - two years or three years but if you can
82:44 - try to maximize as much time as possible
82:46 - now I know a lot of people are busy a
82:48 - lot of you guys have jobs or you know
82:50 - you guys have families so you can't do
82:53 - 15 hours a day of coding but what's the
82:55 - max you can do
82:56 - how much max focus can you put in if you
82:58 - can do that you can make the result
82:59 - happen a lot sooner
83:01 - oh I'm sorry guys the tap is annoying
83:03 - why is the tap why can people hear the
83:06 - tap I'm so confused about that um sorry
83:14 - about that guys now it should be gone
83:16 - apologize just learning the software you
83:19 - know Zachary says besides bootstrap do
83:26 - you have any other frameworks you
83:27 - recommend so front-end I recommend
83:29 - materialise quite a bit I love it so you
83:31 - can try giving materialise it's made by
83:34 - Google you can give that a try
83:53 - can I do my project with vanilla J s
83:56 - alone yes you can whatever you can do
83:58 - with Jake where you can do with vanilla
84:00 - J's because at the end of the day it's
84:01 - just JavaScript so yeah
84:15 - oh yeah there's a we have a developer
84:17 - who teaches react to in our course
84:19 - profit JavaScript or sunny he's awesome
84:21 - and he loves react maybe after the
84:23 - challenge is over if you guys want we
84:26 - could build more projects and more apps
84:28 - in this group you know we will take a
84:29 - poll from you guys and ask you what kind
84:31 - of stuff you guys want to build and then
84:33 - we'll build it right here
84:34 - that'll be freaking really really fun
84:36 - there's so many questions coming in you
84:39 - guys I'm sorry I'm just having trouble
84:41 - keeping up with it like it's really
84:44 - difficult
84:57 - okay so Yuri asked so this is a little
85:00 - like different question but I think I
85:02 - kind of want to answer it so Yuri says I
85:04 - want to become a millionaire before 25
85:07 - I'm currently 17 can I yes yes that's
85:17 - the short answer for it but how it's
85:22 - like for me what helped was getting
85:28 - really good at coding and then scaling
85:31 - my income really really fast right so
85:32 - like I figured out how to get really
85:34 - good at coding just cuz I loved it and
85:35 - everything got crazy good at it really
85:37 - fast by just putting in lots of hours
85:39 - and if you guys have any background on
85:41 - me I failed in like almost every math
85:44 - class I had a terrible GPA in my college
85:47 - and all of that like a 2.8 below a 2.0 I
85:50 - got like a 1.9 GPA I don't have a degree
85:54 - from college as a college dropout what
85:57 - other good qualities do I have let's see
86:01 - I give good hugs my girlfriend says
86:06 - that's good yeah so basically like any
86:10 - technical stuff or anything like that
86:12 - like math or whatever like I sucked at
86:14 - it so just so you guys know I didn't
86:16 - give you context like I'm not some math
86:18 - genius or anything like that I just put
86:20 - I just put in a lot of time into it so I
86:23 - want to just bring it to that like a lot
86:26 - of putting in a lot of time is gonna be
86:28 - the thing that helps you get there
86:29 - faster and once you can scale up your
86:33 - income then if you want to go and you
86:34 - want to make a million dollars a year or
86:36 - more that's gonna happen not from a job
86:38 - but then you're doing the thing that's
86:40 - above it so for example you starting
86:42 - your own SAS company so like you become
86:45 - such a good developer and then you learn
86:46 - marketing and then use like launch a
86:49 - software as a service company so think
86:51 - like you guys know about calendly
86:53 - literally all they do is a calendar app
86:55 - literally just a calendar freaking app
86:58 - they make 30 million dollars a year it's
87:01 - just a calendar still can't get over
87:04 - that convertkit okay if I showed you
87:09 - guys convertkit so let me actually
87:11 - go up here and look up convertkit bear
87:14 - metrics and cool so here we go
87:20 - convertkit and you can actually see they
87:22 - have made all their finances publicly
87:24 - available so you guys can actually go to
87:26 - convertkit bear metros comm this is a
87:28 - company that provides email it's a
87:30 - software okay that just lets you send
87:32 - email so a lot of people all at once
87:34 - okay
87:35 - just email guys and this company now
87:38 - does what 1.8 million dollars per month
87:40 - you do 1.8 million dollars per month so
87:44 - what is that 1 million times 12 to 22
87:50 - million dollars a year so yes it's very
87:54 - possible keep your mind open keep keep
87:57 - going just think oh I want to make like
87:58 - 10 thousand or a hundred thousand you
88:00 - can make a lot more than a hundred
88:01 - thousand dollars a year like once you
88:04 - learn how to make a hundred thousand
88:05 - dollars a year it's actually like not
88:06 - that much hey Pascale do you want to
88:10 - stop asking the same question over and
88:14 - over again because we're gonna remove
88:16 - you baby somebody just so we can keep
88:25 - the quality high because it seems like
88:26 - some people are spamming the chat and so
88:28 - we're just gonna remove them but yeah
88:31 - guys this is an email software what it
88:33 - allows you to do send emails you don't
88:35 - have to be a brilliant coder to build
88:37 - something like this because you can on
88:39 - the on your back-end you could use
88:40 - something like send grid okay send grid
88:44 - literally allows you to create a app
88:47 - that lets other people send emails so
88:49 - you can you send grid to build your app
88:52 - so like for all we know they could just
88:54 - be using send grid and now they've just
88:55 - found a way to sell this experience to
89:00 - other users and make it amazing I use
89:02 - their service convertkit service and
89:04 - it's a lot so keep your brain forward
89:09 - and be thinking about like what other
89:12 - things you can do right so for somebody
89:14 - who's asking me how can you become a
89:15 - millionaire before 25 by taking it at a
89:18 - level where you can provide this to a
89:20 - lot of people at once meaning like
89:23 - oftentimes your
89:24 - yourself into a business right you're
89:26 - offering the service to many many people
89:28 - cool okay so there you go gene says
89:39 - thanks buddy I'm and cool too gene says
89:44 - John Warren thanks buddy I'm an old

90:08 - hack ultimate hack T what I recommend is
90:12 - actually do this okay so get loom get
90:18 - loom video okay get this software and
90:22 - what this allows you to do is actually
90:26 - make videos and send them out okay so I
90:30 - would highly recommend you actually get
90:32 - something like this and instead of
90:34 - sending written proposals like you write
90:36 - something to them but send a link to the
90:38 - video and just be like hey I made a
90:39 - video for you and then your video looks
90:41 - something like this hey what's up I'm
90:43 - team you needed an e-commerce app built
90:46 - as I saw in your portfolio and guess
90:48 - what I can actually help you build it
90:49 - here are a few ecommerce apps I've built
90:52 - then like screencast and show them some
90:54 - of your own e-commerce app so you're
90:55 - working on or maybe you've built and
90:58 - then send that in okay short one two
91:01 - minute video personally made for that
91:03 - person and you can do it extremely fast

91:18 - you guys
91:21 - [Laughter]
91:28 - aziz it's funny because on our team we
91:32 - have one developer jacob who loves view
91:34 - and then we have one developer sunny who
91:37 - loves react but I'm team react cuz of
91:40 - sunny you know Jacob he builds these
91:46 - apps that don't look that good so yeah
91:51 - yeah the he has good back in but he's
91:54 - too much of a software developer you
91:56 - know he just focuses too much on that so
91:58 - the apps don't look good but uh that's
91:59 - why I'm team react Jas well maybe we
92:02 - should have like a versus you know
92:04 - there's about like Jacob versus sunny
92:06 - and then they're like live code Julius
92:13 - do we just post a homework on the

92:23 - upload it
92:31 - Abdulla says you putting in a lot of
92:33 - information hell yeah you know that's
92:35 - how we do it lots of value people are
92:40 - literally recorded each word how I loved
92:42 - it yep
92:58 - Zakaria says how's the Google Maps
93:00 - project valued at 5700 so on up work
93:03 - somebody had the exact specs that we are
93:06 - currently gonna build into this project
93:09 - but there was a job posting that said we
93:13 - need a developer to build a Google Maps
93:15 - project and it should be able to connect
93:17 - with api's and it should be a store
93:19 - locator that I shouldn't be able to
93:20 - locate stores within like a CERN's if
93:22 - code so we took all those specs we broke
93:26 - it down step by step we had Naz actually
93:30 - do the entire freelancing project once
93:34 - he did that project we then we were like
93:38 - okay now let's turn it into a video like
93:41 - well then we actually went through and
93:42 - practiced and and like made it step by
93:44 - step so we could teach anybody didn't
93:46 - build this 5700 our project and that's
93:48 - what we're actually gonna be bringing
93:50 - for you tomorrow and helping you build
93:52 - so it's a real project that somebody's
93:54 - out there paying almost six grand for
93:56 - and we're breaking it down I'm gonna
93:58 - step by step help you build it so now

95:44 - want to go even further I would join
95:45 - profit JavaScript because it's the best
95:47 - course if you want to learn more about
95:49 - JavaScript I'm in the program and it's
95:52 - one of the best decisions ever
95:53 - now I'm an eighteen year old student and
95:56 - now I'm a JavaScript success coach for
95:58 - the program helping others become
96:00 - amazing developers trust everyone in the
96:02 - program is amazing and you guys will
96:04 - love it
96:05 - Danielle thank you so much really
96:07 - appreciate you and Danielle just like
96:09 - he's awesome just such good energy and

96:13 - and yeah he's he's just kicking ass he's
96:15 - awesome thank you for that Jess Yousef
96:20 - we will all learn together okay guys so
96:26 - Julia says thank you so much for
96:28 - answering my question of course you got
96:29 - it Jelena says what is the deadline for
96:36 - the homework so deadline for the
96:38 - homework is really you know we have a
96:42 - five day challenge as long as you get it
96:45 - all done in the five days you're good to
96:47 - go if you miss the five days and you're
96:49 - outside of that then when we are
96:50 - announcing the winner we you will like
96:52 - we're not going able to announce you
96:54 - okay
96:55 - so just make sure you're within that
96:58 - five day window and I would say try to
97:01 - keep up with the homework on a daily
97:03 - basis and keep submitting it because
97:04 - otherwise I might start to get a lot for
97:06 - you guys
97:14 - do we need html5 and css3 background you
97:17 - guys don't but if you want to go online
97:18 - and like learn some html5 or css3 even
97:22 - from our clever programmer channel you
97:25 - can go ahead and enjoy that and like
97:27 - learn it and yeah I mean it'll give you
97:29 - some more insight into the challenge
97:30 - like if you guys want to do any extra
97:32 - stuff around HTML CSS and before the
97:36 - challenge you could do that and it just
97:37 - gives you more like insight into what
97:40 - we're gonna be doing together and maybe
97:43 - you will feel less lost okay so that's
97:45 - fine you can do that Simon Simon Says I
97:57 - missed information from the beginning

98:31 - profit JavaScript and profitable
98:34 - programmer nice awesome so he joined our
98:37 - JavaScript course and our Python course
98:39 - nice I love to code more and more hours
98:42 - of coding daily is really fun with these
98:44 - instructors yep
98:45 - so yeah guys like you guys see how much
98:47 - fun we're making this challenge that's

99:16 - single week you guys are getting
99:18 - beginners for now we're just launch a
99:20 - live classes every single week for
99:22 - beginners so beginners get to live
99:25 - classes every single week so they're
99:27 - literally we are like four live classes
99:29 - every single week and really the goal is
99:32 - to be able to provide more value than
99:33 - any coding bootcamp and for a fraction
99:36 - of the price you know whereas coding
99:38 - boot camps for like ten thousand dollars
99:39 - this program is a fraction of that price
99:41 - but it's like a premium program that

99:59 - that's how we do it I always try to keep
100:01 - it lit so thank you for that
100:13 - okay so thank you so a lot of guests
100:17 - keep asking like how are you gonna
100:18 - choose the winners so how we're gonna
100:21 - choose the winners guys is based on your
100:23 - participation your energy along with
100:26 - your effort and the projects that you're
100:28 - doing okay so we take a look at kind of
100:30 - all the things and then the last day so
100:34 - like for example what that looks like is
100:36 - how much are you customizing your
100:38 - portfolio or your app how much time are
100:41 - you putting into building your project
100:42 - then are you present on these live
100:45 - streams are we seeing on these live
100:46 - streams and we know you in the community
100:48 - a clever programmer because if we don't
100:50 - are you helping other people in the
100:53 - community because we go through the
100:54 - comments and we see who's helping who
100:55 - write and we literally look at this for
100:59 - hours and hours every single day so if
101:01 - you're helping other members of the
101:02 - community if you're bringing in positive
101:04 - energy and leading that goes even beyond
101:07 - your skill set so if you're a beginner
101:09 - like for example last time Jessica won
101:11 - and kiss go on and do on all of them are
101:13 - actually beginners and coding like
101:16 - beginner to maybe intermediate right and
101:18 - they won first place second place in
101:20 - third place so it's not so much about
101:24 - skill level you guys like for example
101:25 - say you're the most amazing developer in
101:27 - here but then you don't communicate with
101:28 - anybody else there's no way we're gonna
101:30 - pick you as a winner okay if you're not
101:32 - actually bringing in good energy and
101:34 - inspiring other people you're not gonna
101:37 - win just letting you guys know that so
101:39 - we're a lot about that so bring good
101:42 - energy put in work every day participate
101:45 - you know show your face you know on the
101:47 - comments on the live streams help people
101:50 - build a project put in the work and then
101:54 - on the last day we want to get your
101:56 - experience so like we have everybody
101:59 - send us a video on the last day of what
102:02 - your five-day experience of this
102:03 - challenge it was like so there you can
102:05 - share your story with us and everything
102:07 - so that matters too and that helps us
102:10 - decide like who we're gonna pick as you
102:12 - know one of the winners
102:19 - how long do we have to finish the
102:21 - project once we're done making it you
102:23 - will have these five days to be able to
102:25 - put it together community and then
102:27 - finish the project okay
102:34 - yep Amanat says don't worry guys the
102:37 - link for the portfolio Docs will be
102:39 - posted once this live is over so just
102:42 - keep that in mind okay Milton says I
102:48 - love that Milton is like recording the
102:50 - entire screen so I can watch later you
102:52 - don't have to do that this is already
102:54 - being recorded so you'll be able to see
102:56 - it later
103:01 - who's n F Joseph says cause ease the N F
103:05 - of software development is that some
103:07 - kind of like reference to hip-hop
103:10 - artists what is fully what is it okay
103:30 - yeah there you go
103:31 - hey let's go ID f us off for development
103:38 - alright let's get out of here can I
103:41 - switch my nice dope yes we're gonna this
103:48 - is gonna be uploaded how did you get
103:51 - started Hugh glass how did you get
103:53 - started server-side development I got
103:55 - started because that's kind of what the
103:56 - next step was for me and I needed it for
103:59 - my freelancing job so I started learning
104:01 - Django I started learning server-side
104:03 - development and you know I needed to
104:05 - know like how do I create a login where
104:07 - people can go and login how can I store
104:11 - information and people can retrieve it
104:13 - then I had these problems of like I
104:15 - don't want everybody do you be able to
104:17 - see everybody's contents and then we
104:19 - needed permissions and authentication
104:21 - and that's when I started learning it so
104:22 - it's really like by doing and one step
104:24 - at a time and yeah that's that's kind of
104:27 - one thing that helped me get started
104:28 - really really fast
104:31 - ashle asks is this being recorded
104:34 - absolutely what are the ways Michael
104:41 - says what are the ways we can use this
104:42 - app so you guys saw some people turn
104:43 - into covert 19 some people turn into
104:45 - store locator you guys can get creative
104:47 - with this and turn it and really
104:49 - anything that you want the creativity
104:52 - really depends on you you could even
104:54 - take what you learn from you turn it's a
104:56 - whole different app okay
104:58 - like within clever programmer within
105:01 - clever programmer what one of our team's
105:04 - did is they like build the app for
105:06 - JavaScript success coaches and then then
105:08 - like put the JavaScript success coaches
105:10 - on the map and you can like see where
105:12 - everybody lives so you know if you have
105:14 - family members in different areas you
105:15 - could put where all your family members
105:17 - live okay or you could put like we're
105:18 - all of certain something is right people
105:21 - can go see like the eight wonders of the
105:23 - world you can put them on the Google
105:24 - Maps on your project people should be
105:26 - able to go see it so get creative with
105:28 - it Abdullah says Naz dumansky is the
105:33 - best yes I actually I mean I kind of
105:37 - agree you know now fully agree he's
105:40 - probably so bad right now like he can't
105:43 - talk back yeah I love to make knowledge
105:46 - man yeah you can't talk back right now
105:47 - you know so I can see what I wrong
105:49 - Naz I'm the best bro we love nonce he
105:55 - gets so worked up over this stuff I love
105:58 - it
106:01 - Josh says I am really excited on this
106:06 - free training challenge I want to
106:07 - improve my skills since the company I
106:09 - belong to is looking for people that can
106:11 - create automation using Java hope I can
106:13 - make it and land that opportunity thanks
106:15 - in advance of course whatever you learn
106:17 - from this even if you're using a
106:18 - different language like Java because I
106:20 - just want to I just want you guys to
106:22 - understand JavaScript right there is
106:25 - different than Java okay two different
106:28 - language is completely different but if
106:31 - you learn the fundamentals of this
106:33 - language and you get good at it
106:35 - you can apply it to Java look right away
106:37 - and pick it up not a problem at all okay
106:39 - if you get good at one programming
106:41 - language which means you get good at
106:42 - programming it
106:43 - self and problem-solving and thinking
106:45 - you can translate it so fast to any
106:48 - other language
106:52 - nice Miriam says this is so cool awesome
106:55 - Miriam I'm glad you like it

107:41 - into a link and you can just go hey I've
107:43 - made a video for you everybody wants to
107:45 - see that
107:45 - and then you personalize it for that
107:48 - person so you go you want to build

109:43 - just hungry you want to do more well let
109:45 - me give you more
109:46 - we literally have an 8 hour free
109:48 - JavaScript course on YouTube so go and
109:49 - take advantage of that alright so like
109:53 - go on YouTube and type in well
110:10 - JavaScript course clever programmer or
110:13 - JavaScript course probably just itself
110:16 - and this is gonna come up so like you
110:18 - can watch this
110:24 - of course after an ad comes on so this
110:31 - right what's up Sather system audio i

114:48 - Sangeeta says I just finished your HTML
114:51 - CSS tutorial on YouTube I didn't know
114:53 - anything aka I didn't know the ABCD of
114:56 - CSS which I know what that really means
114:58 - people from our country say ABCD of
115:00 - something means like nothing so she
115:03 - didn't know anything of CSS until
115:05 - yesterday and she says I learned lots of
115:07 - amazing stuff in a real time application

115:20 - underrated thank you so much I really
115:22 - appreciate that
115:22 - she says kudos to Aaron as well I had
115:25 - followed his tutorials in Python and
115:26 - enjoyed learning from him I should say
115:29 - your channel is my most amazing
115:31 - discovery in 2020 so far holy crap
115:33 - that's awesome thank you so much
115:35 - Sangeeta I really really appreciate it
115:36 - and guys yes we work so hard like 2019
115:42 - we worked ourselves into the ground
115:43 - building like all that stuff and then
115:45 - YouTube would give us no views like ever
115:48 - but I'm so glad you guys are able to
115:51 - find that content and stuff now so yeah
115:52 - you guys just take advantage of it
115:54 - there's so much material it's the
115:56 - treasure trove like just go and enjoy
115:58 - sit back consume get some popcorn and
116:01 - have fun chicken po y a chicken popcorn
116:07 - Joseph says let's see hey I appreciate
116:11 - all your content man I just have a
116:13 - question do you recommend when we learn
116:14 - a new concept should we practice it for
116:16 - hours and hours until we understand it
116:18 - but not
116:18 - actually memorize it with flashcards
116:20 - like will we memorize it as we begin
116:22 - doing it honestly I think that so I'll
116:29 - give you guys some background I went to
116:31 - a religious school and at that religious
116:33 - school for 4 years I had to like
116:34 - memorize a book like book of Quran ok
116:38 - literally for four years and I memorized
116:40 - the entire thing and I don't understand
116:43 - Arabic but I can recite it and like
116:46 - kinda remember it but like so I
116:49 - understand memorization really really
116:51 - well probably better than most people on
116:53 - the planet just because for four years I
116:56 - did nothing but purely memorize so what
117:01 - I learned from that experience is few
117:04 - years later now I don't actually
117:06 - remember anything at all and what I
117:09 - learned is memorization is actually not
117:11 - a byproduct of repetition though I think
117:14 - repetition can help for sure like making
117:18 - it kind of subconscious but I think it's
117:20 - mostly a byproduct of deep understanding
117:22 - once you have really deep understanding
117:24 - of something you can actually like
117:26 - reverse-engineer and play that thing out
117:29 - on what happened why it happened for
117:30 - example you know if you have a
117:34 - girlfriend or you're in a relationship
117:36 - one thing you'll notice with women
117:37 - they're amazing at is remembering
117:41 - anything that happened like literally
117:43 - something happened like few weeks ago
117:44 - and my girlfriend will remember
117:46 - everything like step by step how it made
117:49 - her feel like the emotion she was going
117:51 - to she's like I felt like this and does
117:52 - what happened I'm like and I'm like I
117:54 - can't remember that at all it's because
117:57 - she has a really good system for
118:00 - connecting association with emotions and
118:02 - she's like deeply energy it's not as she
118:04 - sat there and look repeated that to
118:06 - herself forever just right just like
118:09 - that'd be crazy right but like just
118:12 - understood it same thing for chess I'm
118:15 - top 1% in the world in chess I don't
118:19 - play it as much anymore but I used to
118:20 - play it competitively and I got really
118:22 - really good at it I love it I still play
118:24 - it all the time so if any of you guys
118:25 - want a challenge you know I'll be fun
118:27 - but in chess one thing that happens is
118:31 - if you take me to a
118:32 - I played probably two months ago I can
118:34 - actually play the entire game out even
118:36 - though I haven't looked at it at all
118:38 - and play out the entire thing because I
118:42 - so deeply understand why each move was
118:44 - made what I was experiencing and feeling
118:46 - through the each move so long story
118:50 - short Joseph when it comes to coding and
118:52 - what I will tell you is it's a matter of
118:54 - deep understanding so if you actually
118:56 - work on your coding projects and you
118:59 - understand them deeply inside and out
119:01 - you will never have to worry about
119:03 - memorizing anything again the only time
119:05 - you really need to worry about
119:06 - memorizing is like when you haven't like
119:08 - fundamentally understood that concept
119:10 - and so I wouldn't focus so much on like
119:15 - drill and kill I would just focus more
119:17 - on like building things and enjoying
119:19 - them along the way okay Kevin says I
119:30 - have to rest now be prepared for
119:31 - tomorrow it's 4:00 a.m. here in Jakarta
119:33 - awesome awesome
119:38 - [Music]
119:45 - awesome so Yuri says once I become
119:47 - really good at programming I would love
119:48 - to work with your dream goals yep get
119:50 - really good at it hit us up and let's
119:53 - develop a sass together you know like
119:55 - we'll actually launch it to the market
119:56 - that's something I'm actually interested
119:57 - in doing like if somebody seriously
