00:00 - [Music]
00:05 - what's up my beautiful people welcome
00:08 - back today we are doing another coding
00:11 - challenge this is your host Rafa Kazi
00:14 - from clever programmer and we are going
00:18 - to jump into the reverse slicing
00:20 - challenge we just completed aardvark or
00:23 - you should have completed it and today's
00:25 - coding challenges reverse slicing
00:27 - challenge so let's see how this one
00:30 - works
00:30 - look they're telling you slicing it's
00:33 - like you know you can think of it like
00:35 - cutting things and in Python in code if
00:38 - you are given a list of things you can
00:41 - slice and pick and choose whichever one
00:43 - you want
00:43 - okay so you got apple banana bread you
00:47 - can just slice by one and pick up that
00:50 - you know the banana or slice by two and
00:53 - get the bread or slice by zero and get
00:58 - the Apple okay so it's very simple and
01:04 - I'll show you what I mean by that here
01:06 - as you can see they have some of these
01:08 - code that some of this code actually
01:11 - write up on the top and as you can see
01:13 - where they have you know like a list
01:17 - with first second third fourth fifth six
01:19 - they're slicing it from 0 to 3 which
01:23 - means from first second third fourth but
01:27 - it only goes from first third as you can
01:29 - see right here okay and then in this
01:34 - example where they say list start from
01:37 - three and go up until forever what that
01:41 - will get for you is will start from 0 1
01:43 - 2 3 the fourth guy so the fourth element
01:46 - on the list and go all the way up to 6
01:49 - and more right and that's what's
01:51 - happening here now what if we were given
01:57 - something we are given a function called
02:01 - reverse string and what we have to do
02:03 - for this guy is if you give it arc it
02:06 - should bring back Gras GRA and if you
02:09 - give it something like hi it should
02:12 - return hi
02:13 - verse of how would you do that learn
02:17 - actively code right below this video if
02:20 - you're on the website you should be able
02:22 - to code it right below you don't even
02:23 - have to open up your own Python and come
02:26 - up with your own solution and as you can
02:30 - see on my screen the solution for this
02:33 - is actually you know quite simple so let
02:36 - me explain let's say I give you
02:38 - something like the string hello right
02:40 - now if I gave it to you from zero to two
02:45 - what would you get you would get H and
02:48 - the e that's it so what if I gave it to
02:53 - you
02:53 - so I instead of starting from H what if
02:58 - I wanted to start from the e well I
03:00 - could say start from one and I could do
03:03 - this to say go for forever right
03:05 - now what if I wanted to so remember it
03:08 - start stop and then step what if I
03:11 - change the number of steps so let's say
03:13 - I did this I just kept this default the
03:16 - middle one which is stop so basically
03:19 - we're saying don't stop keep going
03:20 - forever
03:21 - whoops and then for us for step I'm
03:26 - saying step by two which means every
03:29 - other one and you can see you'll get
03:31 - back you can see you'll get back HL and
03:36 - O because if you start from hello and
03:38 - you take out every other character you
03:40 - take out the H then you take out the L
03:43 - then you hop over you take out the Oh
03:46 - what if I wanted to walk backwards well
03:50 - the solution for that if you haven't
03:52 - tried it here's a spoiler we put
03:56 - negative one and what this does is it
04:00 - says walk backward okay that's the
04:02 - simplest way to understand it would say
04:04 - walk backwards negative one and so we
04:07 - just go here we go boom and in Python
04:10 - count this is like a super easy way to
04:14 - do it and boom look at this we said
04:19 - print reverse string argh
04:21 - we got back grow the top here and on
04:23 - line 15 we said hi and we got back the
04:26 - river
04:26 - of that so that is amazing you guys we
04:31 - were able to solve this challenge it was
04:33 - very easy especially if you are you know
04:35 - somebody a clever programmer who's been
04:37 - going through the courses this should be
04:39 - easy for you well my goal is to make
04:42 - this easier for everybody who's new so
04:44 - if you're new to this channel welcome
04:45 - can you this website welcome but if
04:48 - you've already been here and you're one
04:50 - of the clever programmers right this
04:54 - should be a review for you and this
04:55 - should be a way for you to test your
04:57 - skills and don't just go already know
04:59 - this you should walk away you know
05:00 - you're too cool for school this is below
05:03 - you a lot of you guys I work with and
05:07 - there's really simple things that you
05:10 - guys might get stuck on and to be honest
05:11 - I get stuck on simple things too which
05:13 - is why I take the time out every day to
05:15 - practice even really simple things
05:17 - that's when I'm coding I'm coding at the
05:19 - speed of light people like how are you
05:20 - doing it well I just made more mistakes
05:22 - than you did and it was the the simple
05:26 - reason is that I just keep practicing it
05:28 - relentlessly so even if it's something
05:30 - looks like it's below you perfect take
05:32 - that time to challenge yourself and
05:34 - crush that challenge rather than be lazy
05:37 - sit on your couch and just hit skip or
05:39 - next video
05:40 - okay so actively learn actively engage
05:43 - that's the reason for this entire
05:45 - channel okay I want you to communicate
05:47 - actively engage posted in the comments
05:49 - below here on youtube post in the
05:51 - comments below your solution if you're
05:52 - on my website and if you are on my
05:54 - website you'll be able to code right
05:55 - there as well as always thank you guys
05:58 - so much for watching I love your faces
06:01 - off and I'll see you in the next video
