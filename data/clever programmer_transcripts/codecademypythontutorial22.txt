00:00 - hey guys what is up this is kazy from
00:02 - clever program.com welcome to another
00:05 - episode of Code Academy Python tutorial
00:08 - Series this is part
00:11 - 21 so I'm really bad with this numbers
00:15 - thing it's actually part
00:17 - 22 so where did we leave off last time
00:21 - we left off covering uh while Loops okay
00:26 - and we covered all of this all the way
00:28 - up to your own else while and we
00:30 - finished all of that so let's go just
00:33 - take a little peek at our course page
00:36 - just uh check where we
00:39 - are
00:41 - oh they changed that on us while we were
00:44 - in the middle of working on it they
00:45 - Chang the entire interface on
00:48 - us so here it is here are the loops and
00:53 - we are 42% of this and we're past the
00:56 - 60% barrier nice let's click on this
01:00 - loops and let's keep going so now we're
01:04 - going to work with for Loops I enjoy for
01:06 - Loops much more than wild Loops I did
01:09 - use S like wild Loops a lot
01:12 - till I started using four Loops a lot
01:15 - and now I just enjoyed them most of the
01:17 - times you can use four loops and they
01:22 - they're easier to work with and they
01:23 - will do what you want to
01:26 - do
01:28 - also a lot of the time stimes with wild
01:30 - Loops you have to be careful and make a
01:32 - condition that stops for for Loops
01:33 - that's never the case you have to give
01:36 - it that thing to stop and here we just
01:38 - say run 10 times this is pretty much
01:41 - saying that cuz range 10 gives
01:45 - you this list right we've talked about
01:48 - how range is a function that generates a
01:52 - list on the fly so it gives you this I
01:54 - is zero the first time right I is zero
01:57 - the first time then it's one then it's
01:59 - two and if it prints out 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
02:02 - 8 uh each
02:05 - time so let's go back and then as soon
02:09 - as it runs out of the list it stops
02:11 - right so they want us to make sure that
02:13 - we print out 10 so
02:15 - here what do they want us to do make the
02:18 - loop print the numbers from 0 to 19
02:21 - instead of 0 to 9 so I should do 0 to 19
02:23 - which means that I should really do 20
02:26 - because
02:28 - zero is in included because we start
02:31 - from zero and 20 is excluded but 19 is
02:35 - included right we go up to 20 but not
02:39 - including 20 that's a general
02:42 - convention and here we have counting 0
02:45 - to 19 perfect for your hobbies this is
02:48 - this kind of loop is useful when you
02:50 - want to do something a certain number of
02:53 - times such as aend something to a list
02:55 - so again for Loops are really useful we
02:57 - just keep looping through keep appending
02:59 - the thing to the list and that way our
03:01 - list keeps getting bigger so we're going
03:04 - to keep appending things so I can do
03:08 - create a for Loop that prompts the user
03:09 - for hobby three times and appends each
03:11 - one of those Hobbies okay they want us
03:13 - to get our hands dirty now so they want
03:15 - us to do something so we're going to
03:18 - say
03:20 - um all right so hobby is equal to
03:25 - Raw input what is
03:30 - uh your
03:32 - favorite right what is or what is one of
03:36 - your what is your
03:38 - hobby what are your
03:41 - hobbies sorry I'm I'm uh really caring
03:45 - about the user interface of this what is
03:47 - your
03:48 - hobby so let's just make it simple and
03:52 - we got that so that'll give us the
03:54 - string and then what we want to do is we
03:56 - want to ask this three times so it'll be
03:58 - a part of a for Loop fry range three CU
04:02 - we already know we need to run three
04:03 - times are we going to use this I no so
04:07 - I'm just going to make it that
04:08 - underscore cuz I don't think we're going
04:10 - to be using that variable we just want
04:12 - to run this loop three
04:13 - times and I'm going to say Hobbies do
04:17 - append hobby okay and then ultimately I
04:21 - can say print
04:23 - [Music]
04:25 - Hobbies what is your hobby hobby is um
04:32 - soccer another hobby Is
04:35 - Lifting and what is another
04:38 - hobby let's see I I went skydiving but
04:41 - that's not a hobby cuz I did it once and
04:43 - it was pretty fun scary at the same time
04:47 - that was two months ago that was amazing
04:50 - H let me think of another good hobby
04:52 - that I like to do so I have also started
04:54 - jiujitsu that's been amazing I love it
04:58 - let's put that
05:00 - and here you got that list soccer
05:02 - lifting
05:03 - Jiu-Jitsu this U is ignored by python
05:06 - it's just there to show you for some
05:09 - reason python 2 does it Python 3 does
05:12 - not do this okay so just ignore that you
05:16 - like it doesn't
05:18 - exist create a for Loop okay cool for
05:22 - your strings using a for Loop you can
05:25 - print out each individual character in a
05:27 - string you've already seen this
05:30 - so thing is equal to spam for C and
05:32 - thing print C so better way to say it
05:35 - for
05:37 - letter
05:38 - right so now they want us to do it add a
05:42 - second for Loop so that each character
05:43 - in word is printed out so I would say
05:47 - for character in word print character or
05:53 - I would say letter in word letter is
05:55 - simpler I will usually use letter letter
05:58 - in Word print letter let's run it let's
06:01 - check it out let's see what
06:03 - happens and you got exactly what we
06:06 - expected that you would get right spam
06:09 - exclamation mark um the first Loop right
06:12 - here and then the second Loop ran and we
06:14 - got exit exclamation mark right that's
06:17 - what we expected to happen Okay for your
06:20 - a string manipulation is useful in for
06:22 - Loops if you want to modify some content
06:24 - in a string so sometimes we want to
06:26 - change a string okay let's see so here
06:30 - they're just simply teaching showing you
06:32 - how to access each character in a word
06:33 - and print it
06:34 - out the example prints out M the first
06:37 - time a r b l e okay and here they show
06:42 - you the comma character after our print
06:45 - State means that our next print
06:46 - statement keeps printing on the same
06:47 - line so this is a nice little trick you
06:50 - can do to print everything on the same
06:52 - line okay so if I go here paste
06:56 - it does this actually work in Python
07:04 - 3 doesn't look like it but apparently in
07:09 - Python two it works right so let me
07:12 - check that same Loop in Python
07:17 - 2 what when
07:20 - it okay word is equal to
07:23 - Marble for a car in word print car comma
07:30 - okay so in um python 2 you can just put
07:35 - a comma at the end of it and then it'll
07:37 - print it all in the same
07:39 - line
07:41 - okay what would I do to print it out
07:44 - separately well one thing that coming to
07:47 - my mind is I would turn it into a list
07:50 - of list of a word so that separates it
07:53 - out like this and then I'd call uh join
07:58 - uh but I would say join it by one space
08:01 - and then I would go like
08:03 - this that's just how I would do it cuz
08:06 - I'm cool like that and then I can write
08:07 - print in front of
08:09 - it and you can do it too when you're
08:12 - that cool all
08:15 - right
08:17 - um our next print statement keeps
08:20 - printing on the same line let's filter
08:22 - out the letter A from our sting do the
08:23 - following for each character in the
08:27 - phrase hm filter out the letter A from
08:30 - the string so it should a bird in the
08:32 - hand not a bird in the
08:34 - hand do the following for each car
08:38 - character in the
08:40 - phrase if the character is an A or
08:43 - character is an a print X instead of
08:46 - character make sure to include the
08:49 - trailing
08:51 - comma
08:53 - okay so for
08:55 - character oops in phrase if character
09:00 - equal equal an a here I'll do a little
09:05 - trick but let's not get fancy let's just
09:07 - do it
09:12 - simple if the character is capital A or
09:15 - character is small a the trick that I
09:17 - did is just make the character in small
09:20 - or lower case and then just check it
09:22 - that way or make it all in uppercase and
09:23 - check it that way so it would be simpler
09:26 - so if the character is either capital
09:29 - little a so big a or small a uh replace
09:33 - it with an X so print
09:37 - X um
09:39 - otherwise instead of character make sure
09:42 - to include the trailing comma right so
09:44 - here we want to use it like Python 3 and
09:48 - include the trailing comma and then what
09:52 - we want to say is
09:54 - print character otherwise so or else
10:00 - right if that's not the
10:09 - case see X bird in the X HX and d right
10:14 - everywhere it's is oh actually in this
10:16 - case they do want uh also for us to
10:19 - change it to a small uh if it was a
10:21 - small a so this is then the correct way
10:25 - to do
10:27 - it okay cool we did it nice all right we
10:30 - just had to put the trailing commas to
10:32 - make sure everything was on the same
10:33 - line okay cool next lesson for your list
10:37 - perhaps the most useful and most common
10:40 - use of for Loops is to go through a
10:45 - list right we've done a lot of that but
10:50 - they're going to give us more practice
10:52 - cool on each iteration the variable num
10:55 - will be the next value in the list so
10:56 - the first time through it'll be seven
10:58 - then it'll be N9 then it'll be 12 so
11:00 - this variable here right we've done
11:02 - plenty of practice with this in our
11:05 - previous videos so if you have but just
11:07 - to recall if this is the list right
11:10 - numbers is actually that list first time
11:12 - num is going to be seven it's going to
11:13 - print out seven shoot it up into the
11:15 - screen into the terminal then num the
11:18 - variable num will be nine it'll say
11:23 - print n it shoot it out to the screen
11:24 - then it'll be 12 this will be 12 it
11:27 - shoot out to the screen I think you get
11:29 - the idea then it gets to 99 it'll print
11:31 - it out and after that it says the loop
11:33 - is over because it automatically detects
11:36 - it has uh reach the end of the loop or
11:39 - end end of the
11:41 - list write a second here it says and
11:44 - then the loop will exit when there are
11:45 - no more values in the list write a
11:47 - second for Loop that goes through the
11:49 - numbers list and prints each element
11:50 - squared on its own line so again I
11:54 - thought we've done this but okay cool
11:56 - let's it's good to do more practice oh
11:59 - they want us to do it on a separate line
12:00 - so we're going to say for Num in
12:03 - numbers
12:05 - print num squar
12:09 - okay all of it on its own line okay
12:12 - that's what they
12:16 - want so let's see what is 99 squar it is
12:21 - 9,81 which is what we get here and then
12:24 - after that we get none which means
12:26 - everything is over let's see this for
12:30 - your list okay which part are we
12:36 - at step up your
12:39 - fours nice so we just finished our video
12:43 - on the
12:45 - entire uh on the loops on all our four
12:49 - Loops okay so again that's a great one
12:53 - practice the for Loops more okay use
12:56 - that to practice the for Loops take this
12:58 - time to practice your for Loops just
13:01 - like in the last section I told you to
13:02 - practice to while Loops I would make
13:04 - this video longer about the usual 30
13:06 - minutes however these concepts are so
13:09 - key the loops while loops and for Loops
13:12 - that I think that you need to go and
13:14 - practice them one good place you can go
13:17 - to is W3 resource.com for python
13:21 - exercises okay and you can simply choose
13:24 - the data type like kinds of exercises
13:26 - you want right so for example do you
13:29 - want basic exercises string the ones
13:32 - with list so here I would choose these
13:35 - on python data types list 34 exercises
13:38 - with Solutions so you can then check the
13:41 - solution simply click on the
13:44 - exercise and go okay write a program to
13:48 - sum all the items in the list can you do
13:51 - that if you can great write out the
13:54 - program if you can't great also go ahead
13:58 - and write out the program then it's
14:00 - perfect cuz now you get to practice and
14:01 - learn it only if you fail after trying
14:05 - at least for 1 hour 30 minutes or 1 hour
14:08 - then go and look up the answer for me
14:10 - when I was starting out
14:13 - programming it would take me I would be
14:15 - stuck on a problem for weeks okay and I
14:17 - Tred to never almost look at the answer
14:19 - which is probably not the best way to do
14:21 - it because you can be like pulling your
14:22 - hair out and going crazy however I get
14:25 - obsessive when I fall in love with
14:27 - something so I just truly enjoy
14:30 - but you know if you start getting you
14:31 - know your own frustration levels if you
14:34 - start to get frustrated go and look at
14:35 - the solution it'll help you learn it so
14:39 - here it is test out your for Loop
14:41 - knowledge here I'm going to stop the
14:44 - video right here okay this is kazy from
14:47 - clever program.com you just finished
14:49 - watching code academy Python tutorial
14:51 - number
14:52 - 21 we covered for Loops next video we
14:56 - will be talking about dictionary and how
14:58 - to use for Loops in dictionaries okay
15:01 - that's going to be another important key
15:02 - concept key value pair remember that all
15:05 - right enough of the lame jokes this is
15:07 - the end of the video please like it or
15:10 - subscribe I love you guys I will see you
15:12 - in the next video code academy Python
15:14 - tutorial number 22 number 22 I mean
15:18 - number 23 that's the one you guys should
15:21 - get excited
15:23 - for
