00:00 - hey guys what is up how's it going this
00:02 - is Kazi here from clever programmer calm
00:04 - today I'm here with Peter Peter and
00:08 - Peter is actually he worked at Facebook
00:10 - and I know a lot of you guys want to
00:12 - learn how do you actually get a job at
00:14 - Google or Facebook or one of those big
00:16 - companies and so I have the privilege to
00:19 - speak with Peter who happens to be at
00:21 - VidCon so welcome and I would love to
00:25 - kind of just kind of get into it and
00:26 - hear your story and how you got started
00:28 - yeah so I would school at Berkeley and I
00:30 - studied computer science when I was
00:32 - graduating I applied to a bunch of jobs
00:35 - and I got only one of them so almost all
00:38 - of them like rejected me right and end
00:41 - up not I decided I really didn't want to
00:43 - take the job it was a company that I
00:44 - didn't think I would enjoy working at
00:45 - yeah so then I end up doing a start-up
00:47 - with my friends and we just made a web
00:51 - app for fun there was a help to tag
00:52 - photos right this was a while ago so it
00:56 - was less common of a thing then right
00:57 - through that and meeting some people who
01:00 - worked at Facebook and got a interview
01:03 - were there again and I had interviewed
01:04 - before when I graduated from school and
01:06 - I got rejected I'm so I interviewed
01:07 - there again I mean this time I got the
01:09 - job and it worked out and then I worked
01:12 - there for a while as engineer and then I
01:14 - worked there as a product manager and it
01:16 - was a great experience yeah okay what's
01:20 - next awesome so that's great I mean for
01:24 - me to actually hear this and for a lot
01:25 - of the people who are listening to hear
01:27 - that it wasn't necessarily so much you
01:30 - just applying to everywhere you get in a
01:32 - getting job it kind of came out of you
01:34 - having the relationship no but I'm
01:37 - curious to know how much technical
01:39 - knowledge was needed because you know a
01:42 - lot of the people following this channel
01:44 - are beginners are kind of getting
01:46 - started in coding so how much knowledge
01:48 - or what are the things that somebody
01:50 - would need to know to be able to get
01:52 - into the interview and then kind of pass
01:54 - it yeah so I think so I can't speak for
01:58 - Facebook I don't work there now but I
02:00 - think they hire from all sorts of
02:02 - different backgrounds so I think they're
02:04 - sometimes they're hiring for people who
02:05 - are in college sometimes are hiring
02:07 - people who've never went to formal
02:08 - schooling for for programming but just
02:11 - have like top themselves done projects
02:13 - on their own
02:14 - and construe that they can code and it
02:17 - really varies and I think it depends on
02:20 - which type of role you're going forward
02:22 - but across the book like there are
02:23 - people I worked with people who had all
02:25 - sorts of different levels of experience
02:27 - different paths of experience yeah and
02:29 - the general theme was that um people
02:32 - were really excited about doing things
02:34 - and really a lot of the people were
02:36 - really willing to do projects on their
02:37 - own and had a lot of like we're excited
02:40 - about building stuff yeah was the most
02:42 - important part that being said when you
02:45 - do interview um they're looking for a
02:47 - lot of they're gonna test you in all
02:49 - sorts of ways so usually duty to have
02:52 - some sort of if you're interviewed as an
02:53 - engineer you have to have some sort of
02:56 - engineering knowledge it doesn't have to
02:57 - be through school but you have to be
02:59 - like good at coding in some way right
03:02 - okay so you have to develop these coding
03:06 - skills so I imagine somebody like they
03:08 - will go to college and get their
03:10 - experience or maybe somebody who is
03:12 - doing it on their own and getting the
03:14 - experience having those projects but
03:16 - mainly it's so they keep applying and
03:19 - you know again it was curious for me to
03:22 - find out that you ended up getting that
03:24 - opportunity through the relationships
03:27 - you know so
03:29 - when is the right time for people to
03:32 - start building relationships is it
03:34 - should they wait after they've gotten
03:36 - their college degrees should they wait
03:39 - for a certain time and how valuable are
03:42 - the relationships that they built so I
03:48 - don't think it's required but I don't
03:50 - think it certainly helps yeah so I think
03:53 - in general I think in general you should
03:57 - shouldn't necessarily make connections
03:59 - just to make connections but you should
04:02 - be like work on projects with your
04:05 - friends
04:06 - once they've worked on something with
04:07 - you and if what their classmates all
04:09 - sorts of people and then they're gonna
04:11 - be recommending you at a company maybe
04:13 - or working on an open-source project
04:16 - yeah and then you're working with people
04:17 - there but like the more people you work
04:19 - with yeah the more likely they're to
04:21 - know someone somewhere and they can also
04:23 - vote for you and when someone's in a
04:25 - company is interviewing you they can
04:28 - only figure out so much in the interview
04:29 - right but if someone is vouching for you
04:31 - yeah that gives a lot more for their to
04:34 - figure things out so a big thing is like
04:35 - if someone there can vouch for you it's
04:38 - gonna help out a lot yeah so I think in
04:39 - general you you don't want to focus just
04:44 - on the just on coding but you need to be
04:47 - able to code well and you need to work
04:51 - on projects and make friends and talk to
04:53 - them about it so I mean it's good yeah
04:55 - okay and out of curiosity how'd you get
04:59 - into coding and why well I I went to
05:03 - school is like an undeclared engineering
05:05 - and I just took a coding class as a
05:08 - random class and I really enjoyed it I
05:10 - thought it was really fun to make things
05:13 - ayuh since then actually so I did that I
05:17 - took more classes and I ended up
05:18 - majoring in computer science since then
05:21 - I learned that you know what going to
05:23 - school for computer science turns out is
05:25 - not the exact same thing as working as
05:27 - an engineer um so after I worked as a
05:30 - couple of times like for a couple years
05:31 - as an engineer I found that like I
05:33 - wasn't the best thing for me I wasn't
05:35 - the best at it and I didn't I didn't
05:38 - enjoy doing I enjoyed the end product
05:40 - but I didn't enjoy the process as much
05:43 - and that was okay it turned out that a
05:45 - lot of other people on my team were
05:47 - really good at other things and unlike
05:50 - in school where it feels like you all
05:51 - have to be good at everything and work
05:53 - you don't you have to figure out what
05:55 - you're good at it's more important to
05:56 - figure out what you're good at and what
05:58 - you like and then also what you're not
05:59 - good at and find the team where the
06:01 - people who are good at the things that
06:03 - you're not can work together and like
06:06 - all be very energized doing what you're
06:08 - doing and I'll be very good at it so
06:09 - that was a really big lesson for me
06:11 - after a couple years of work is that
06:12 - like I don't have to try and do
06:14 - everything right some things I was
06:15 - trying to do I hated doing but other
06:17 - people loved doing and like once you
06:19 - figure that out and that's why I kind of
06:21 - first I shifted more towards front-end
06:22 - stuff and other people shifted more
06:24 - towards back in and then I shifted more
06:25 - towards actually just like figuring out
06:27 - what we were gonna do together and
06:28 - organizing things but I think it's it is
06:33 - like in school you focus a lot usually
06:34 - on like trying to be good at everything
06:35 - you're doing but in real life you gotta
06:38 - figure out what's the thing you're good
06:39 - at what do you really enjoy and then
06:42 - find people that complement that and
06:44 - find teams that are looking for
06:46 - something like that so beautiful so
06:49 - don't no need to be great at everything
06:51 - like find the thing that you are good at
06:54 - and you I said you kind of ended up
06:56 - moving out of the engineering yeah okay
06:58 - cool and that was with Facebook you
07:01 - moved out of there engineering I moved
07:02 - into a role I moved into a role called
07:04 - product management which is a lot about
07:08 - helping the team work working together
07:10 - to figure out where you're trying to get
07:11 - to and figuring out how to get there
07:12 - like as effectively as possible totally
07:15 - about the whole process and for a while
07:18 - as a project manager I still coded some
07:20 - for the team and then once the team got
07:22 - really big and we were working on all
07:23 - sorts of stuff like Android and iOS and
07:26 - back-end and everything I wasn't coding
07:28 - anymore but so it kind of gradually
07:32 - changed but yeah I figured out that that
07:34 - was the part I enjoyed a lot and other
07:36 - people figured out that didn't enjoy
07:37 - that and like offloading it on me made
07:40 - them got to focus more on the things
07:42 - they really liked so yeah any tips or
07:45 - strategies when it comes to the
07:48 - interviewing process so maybe
07:51 - should they be thinking about some
07:53 - whiteboarding things or whatever just
07:54 - you can free flow on this yeah I think
07:57 - the general thing for an interview is
08:00 - one just I know it sound dumb but don't
08:03 - stress out because a lot of people when
08:05 - they get stressed out they just
08:07 - underperformance do much worse the
08:09 - second thing is just go and practice it
08:11 - with your friends a couple times just
08:13 - because if it's a coding interview I'm
08:15 - just because you you may be really good
08:17 - at coding but you code on your computer
08:19 - and in the interview they may make you
08:20 - code on the board that's entirely
08:22 - different spot and that may make you
08:24 - uncomfortable and it doesn't mean that
08:27 - you would actually be bad at the job but
08:29 - it's like that's their one of the ways
08:31 - that places check on how you're doing so
08:33 - I think it's really good to practice a
08:35 - couple times practice in the same format
08:37 - that you would actually do it so so code
08:39 - on a board or on a piece of paper but
08:41 - something not with the computer if the
08:42 - place wasn't gonna do a computer be
08:45 - comfortable really also use it as a time
08:49 - for you to figure out whether that place
08:50 - is good for you because you don't want
08:53 - to get a job somewhere and then turns
08:55 - out it's not good for you so if there's
08:56 - something that you want to find out
08:58 - about the job ask about that but I think
09:00 - that's I think I'm trying not to be too
09:02 - stressed which is like a hard thing to
09:04 - say but I do think like it's kind of
09:07 - like it's gonna when companies hire
09:10 - people lots of times that don't hire
09:12 - someone who actually is great and that
09:18 - doesn't mean that you're bad it just
09:19 - means that like it's really hard to be
09:21 - confident that someone you've only
09:22 - talked to for I don't know five people
09:25 - for half an hour each so two and a half
09:26 - hours or something to be confident that
09:28 - they're great it's a really hard thing
09:29 - to do and because of that they're gonna
09:32 - not hire a lot of people who are great
09:34 - and that's so you have to go in
09:36 - accepting that and not be like oh just
09:37 - cuz I didn't get hired here doesn't mean
09:39 - that I'm not good at this it may have
09:42 - just been that like I was one of the
09:44 - people who they chose which is very very
09:45 - very common and like in my case I got
09:48 - rejected and then I interviewed again a
09:50 - year later and I got hired
09:51 - so clearly the process isn't like the
09:53 - the same exact thing every time yeah so
09:56 - I think don't if you don't get hired
09:57 - somewhere don't let it stress you out
10:00 - and just go back and try again if you
10:03 - know it's the place you want to work but
10:05 - make sure practice a bit and just try
10:08 - and stay calm I guess that's all I got
10:11 - on that side that I love that thank you
10:13 - and overall on in Facebook what has your
10:17 - experience of working there been like
10:20 - like let's say what was your number one
10:22 - favorite thing and just your overall
10:23 - experience um I really enjoyed working
10:26 - at Facebook um it was awesome and
10:30 - something that was very helpful for me
10:33 - actually is tied back to me changing
10:35 - roles is that Facebook was really really
10:38 - didn't confine me based on my role so
10:42 - even if I was an engineer at some point
10:45 - I was still able to find other things
10:47 - that were not necessarily traditionally
10:49 - in the engineers job to figure out and
10:51 - work on if it was what was most helpful
10:53 - for the team similarly when I was a
10:55 - product manager I was still able to
10:56 - write code and reviewed ifs and stuff
10:59 - like that so I really enjoyed that about
11:02 - Facebook yeah from an engineering
11:03 - perspective I learned a lot from a lot
11:04 - of people who were really good because
11:06 - when other people are reviewing your
11:07 - code they're giving you a lot of
11:08 - feedback and so I was able to grow a lot
11:10 - because of that so overall it was a
11:13 - great experience I enjoyed working there
11:15 - a lot okay beautiful and the number one
11:17 - thing you disliked about working with
11:19 - Facebook oh the number one thing I
11:21 - dislike yeah this is a kind of a dumb
11:24 - answer but I really really hated
11:25 - commuting to work because Facebook is
11:27 - not in San Francisco and I lived in San
11:29 - Francisco yeah I had like ride a bus an
11:31 - hour and a half everywhere each way
11:33 - every day I'm to go to work I was not my
11:36 - favorite would you do on the right there
11:37 - oh I would usually work because I'd be
11:39 - at the Internet and have a laptop so I
11:40 - usually would just and it's kind of a
11:42 - nice time to either respond to email or
11:43 - when I was engineering I would just code
11:44 - on the bus so I would work there but
11:47 - it's still a surprisingly draining just
11:50 - be on a bus for a couple hours each day
11:53 - right so if you enjoyed Facebook so much
11:56 - why'd you leave Facebook what what
11:58 - happened so for me I enjoyed it a lot
12:01 - and I could've seen myself keep working
12:03 - there for a long time
12:05 - but I know my personality my personality
12:07 - is that could get complacent doing
12:09 - something yeah I really wanted to try
12:11 - just doing some other things I worked at
12:14 - Facebook for around eight years and I
12:15 - left Facebook around two years ago so
12:18 - roughly that so I really wanted to just
12:20 - try some different stuff um so just to
12:23 - see whether that was the thing I really
12:25 - liked and I wanted to go back and keep
12:27 - doing it or whether I wanted to do
12:28 - something else and I made some games
12:31 - with some friends we made some mobile
12:32 - apps we yeah we made some chat BOTS I
12:37 - did a bunch of engineering stuff again I
12:38 - coded again and it really reminded me
12:40 - that like you know did you miss it you
12:42 - know at first I did I was like you know
12:43 - what my friends are really much better
12:45 - at this than me and weird is more
12:46 - effective when they were doing various
12:48 - things but it was still fun and I
12:49 - enjoyed making the projects so I did
12:51 - that
12:52 - and now I'm kind of exploring just doing
12:54 - something entirely different and maybe
12:58 - I'll end up going back to it but for me
13:00 - it was important to find the thing that
13:02 - I was excited about and I was lucky
13:03 - enough to be able to do that anytime so
13:07 - different as in what
13:08 - when you say entirely different you know
13:12 - right now I'm very interested in some
13:13 - political issues um so I don't know the
13:16 - best way I can help but I'm gonna try
13:18 - and figure out something that involves
13:19 - leveraging my strengths and kind of
13:22 - helping out in the way I can so maybe
13:25 - and being involved in a campaign of some
13:27 - sort I'm not sure so I'm figuring it out
13:29 - yeah
13:31 - but for me it was I left not because I
13:34 - didn't like it but actually because I
13:35 - liked it and I know is the kind of
13:37 - person where by default I would keep
13:39 - doing the thing I liked and I want to
13:40 - see if maybe there was something that
13:41 - was even better from you and are you
13:43 - ever interested in like starting your
13:45 - own company or are you mostly just kind
13:47 - of doing your thing so for me I guess I
13:50 - have started a couple of projects or
13:53 - companies on my own or with friends not
13:56 - on my own but outside of like a
13:57 - traditional company and I'm not against
14:00 - it but for me it's whatever goal so
14:02 - there's different kinds of people some
14:03 - people care a lot about the process some
14:05 - people care a lot about the goal um I
14:06 - get excited about a goal and then
14:09 - whatever the best way to do it is so
14:11 - when I was a
14:13 - it seems like I don't know about that I
14:15 - just kind of like um some people really
14:17 - enjoy doing a particular thing right I
14:19 - enjoy like working on some goal of some
14:22 - sort so for example maybe the best way
14:28 - to work on a problem is to start a
14:29 - company maybe it's a joining nonprofit
14:30 - maybe it's to join a larger company that
14:32 - already exists yeah maybe it's something
14:35 - else entirely maybe just do something on
14:36 - your own I'm so for me it's like
14:37 - whatever problem I get excited about
14:39 - yeah I'd rather find the right thing for
14:41 - that right
14:42 - versus feeling like I have to start
14:44 - something but I'm very open to it if
14:46 - that's the right thing to do yeah and
14:48 - when you were with Facebook where you
14:49 - travel then it's all good when you were
14:51 - a Facebook were you traveling the world
14:53 - were you located in like one spot you
14:56 - know how was that like were you able to
14:58 - work as a remote developer when you were
15:00 - working at Facebook I didn't so I was
15:03 - based in San Francisco and there's a lot
15:05 - of different Facebook offices now so I
15:09 - could have been based somewhere else but
15:10 - I was based in San Francisco yeah man I
15:12 - worked at the Menlo Park office and I
15:15 - did travel a couple times to work but
15:17 - that was usually for recruiting trips
15:18 - yeah so we were like go to places and
15:20 - interview people or for research trips
15:24 - but other people in other roles would
15:27 - travel more and other people maybe work
15:29 - remote but that wasn't something I did
15:30 - nope okay man this is awesome I kind of
15:34 - loved your journey of getting started to
15:36 - coding and how old were you when you
15:38 - really got started into coding like what
15:40 - was that first moment that inspired you
15:42 - look for example for me I remember it
15:45 - was you know my brother when I was in
15:48 - high school and he inspired me to
15:50 - actually get into coding so I'm really
15:51 - really curious what it was for you that
15:53 - like sparked that interest and got you
15:56 - into it yeah so I guess in high school
15:59 - yeah both math class I had a calculator
16:03 - and it was not a ti-83 Casio calculator
16:06 - so I would be bored in class and I would
16:08 - program the calculator a bit I was so
16:11 - that you know I wasn't doing that
16:14 - I was just like playing with it while I
16:16 - was bored
16:16 - that's maybe like the first kind of
16:18 - programming experience I had but really
16:20 - it was a intro to CS class I took in
16:22 - college I really enjoyed it
16:24 - and there's kind of kept doing more of
16:26 - that yeah beautiful
16:28 - cool and lastly any words on like
16:33 - inspiration or motivation for
16:35 - programmers who are like maybe you know
16:38 - they're like how do I get through this
16:40 - what kind of mindset do I need to have
16:43 - to get through it and how difficult of a
16:46 - journey is it you know kind of what was
16:48 - the mindset that helped you get through
16:50 - and actually get a job at Facebook and
16:53 - so something around the mindset of it
16:55 - that helped you that may it might be
16:57 - able to help somebody else was watching
17:02 - I think it's a hard question because
17:03 - there's not like a specific problem in
17:06 - this case right you reminds that like
17:08 - that helped you kind of push through and
17:10 - not quit like you apply for jobs what
17:12 - made you so wait so I think the thing
17:16 - for me I think the more important
17:19 - mindset thing for me is kind of we
17:21 - talked about earlier which was to
17:23 - eventually realize that like you don't
17:25 - have to be good at everything right so
17:26 - what parts of this am I good at what
17:28 - parts of this not just am I good at but
17:31 - do I like enjoy doing and not all of
17:35 - coding is the same so maybe you're doing
17:36 - UI work and that's what you really enjoy
17:38 - and that's what you're good at
17:39 - maybe you're doing infrastructure work
17:41 - maybe you're doing security work those
17:43 - are all kind of like they're related but
17:45 - they're all different and you may only
17:46 - enjoy some of them yep and that's okay
17:49 - yeah like find the one that you enjoy if
17:51 - it's one of those maybe it's something
17:52 - else entirely but find what you enjoy
17:54 - and that you're good at ideally so if
17:56 - you can find the best of both of those
17:57 - and then focus on that and find people
18:00 - who compliment you and the rest I think
18:03 - that's a big thing for me that's what
18:05 - helped me a lot not so much in school
18:07 - but after school and then once I was
18:09 - working because before that I was pretty
18:11 - stressed out about because like I don't
18:12 - know if I can keep doing this forever
18:14 - like there's so much there are things I
18:15 - liked a lot but there were things I
18:16 - didn't like and my mindset was just I
18:19 - have to have to do all this because I
18:21 - assumed that everyone liked the same
18:23 - things as me but in reality everyone
18:24 - likes different things everyone is good
18:26 - at different things so it's kind of
18:27 - figure out which parts you're good at
18:29 - right and it's okay to it's like okay
18:32 - and normal to not be good at everything
18:33 - and just find what you're good at that's
18:36 - I think that's my comment they're
18:37 - beautiful
18:39 - alright so awesome I think this was kind
18:42 - of pretty amazing I'm just gonna wrap it
18:44 - up so for me the big takeaways were you
18:48 - don't necessarily need to have graduated
18:50 - from Harvard or Berkeley sometimes the
18:55 - big four or the big companies can
18:57 - actually pick you based on a whole
18:59 - variety of different things you know
19:02 - you never kind of gave up even after you
19:04 - applied to so many different places the
19:07 - power of building relationships that
19:09 - actually led you to be able to get the
19:11 - end right
19:12 - during the interview don't freak out and
19:15 - kind of go in there with the relaxed
19:16 - mindset maybe train and prepare yourself
19:19 - before you go in write on a whiteboard
19:21 - and things like that so those are really
19:25 - really valuable tips and also how you
19:29 - started as a developer but it doesn't
19:31 - mean you have to be a developer for the
19:32 - rest of your life like you went in as a
19:34 - developer and then you went into product
19:35 - management and then after that you're
19:37 - like now I'm gonna do something else and
19:39 - now you're going to politics like
19:40 - something completely different so there
19:42 - are different avenues you have here as
19:44 - well to navigate so overall I think this
19:48 - was really wonderful thank you for
19:49 - sharing that experience where can they
19:52 - follow you maybe on instagram maybe
19:54 - something I don't really have any sort
19:56 - of public persona Pidge ghost
