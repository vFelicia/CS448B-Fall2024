00:00 - Stefan says hey man I have a question
00:02 - for you I really want to learn
00:03 - programming and I really started once
00:06 - but I lost my passion and motivation for
00:08 - for it does that mean I'm not for it or
00:11 - what you're gonna lose passion and
00:15 - motivation and then it's gonna come back
00:18 - it's it's like like mjid said a sine
00:23 - wave it's a horrible way to describe it
00:26 - only people who do math or know anything
00:27 - about math will get it but it's like
00:30 - waves you know you'll get really
00:33 - motivated and you'll be like yeah
00:34 - motivated and then you start going down
00:36 - and then all of a sudden you feel
00:38 - motivated and passionate again and then
00:40 - it goes down it comes in cycles but
00:43 - motivation can be reversed engineered so
00:46 - motivation and passion is not what you
00:48 - guys think it is it's not this random
00:52 - thing that happens by luck all of it
00:56 - could actually be reversed engineered
00:58 - and you could turn into a system and
01:00 - make yourself be motivated and
01:03 - passionate so for example as human
01:08 - beings we are really dumb okay we are
01:11 - really really really really stupid as
01:14 - human beings here's what that means
01:17 - whatever is happening around us
01:19 - influences us and what you think are
01:23 - your thoughts aren't actually not your
01:26 - thoughts at all these are thoughts that
01:29 - you have based on the environment that
01:32 - you're in the people that you're around
01:34 - the media that you're consuming that's
01:38 - what is that's what those thoughts are
01:40 - actually comprised of they're not your
01:43 - own there's just a mixture of all these
01:45 - and that unique combination that gets
01:48 - marinated that's inside your head that's
01:50 - what you think is the unique you and are
01:53 - your thoughts now knowing that we could
01:57 - be really depressed that we are really
01:59 - stupid or knowing that we could be
02:01 - really happy because we could
02:03 - reverse-engineer it a lot of things in
02:05 - our life so for example if I feel less
02:08 - passionate or motivated when I'm driving
02:11 - I don't listen to em you
02:13 - because it's a waste of time listening
02:16 - to music it's sometimes good if you're
02:19 - using it to get yourself palm-tree
02:21 - working on something to get yourself
02:22 - focus but if you're driving it's just a
02:24 - waste of time why not listen to books on
02:28 - something like audible why not when
02:31 - you're in a train and you got your
02:32 - headsets in or you're doing a commute
02:35 - listen to books and you could listen to
02:38 - books that motivate you or talk about
02:41 - coding or programming that's one thing
02:44 - you could do here's another amazing
02:47 - crazy hack that's life-changing when you
02:49 - are at home and you're about to eat your
02:52 - food why waste all that time just
02:55 - sitting there eating food looking at a
02:56 - wall or what do some of us do we eat
03:00 - food while watching house of cards while
03:03 - watching stranger things or suits or I
03:06 - don't know whatever news channels or cat
03:10 - videos or just you stuff on YouTube or
03:12 - surfing the internet whatever it may be
03:14 - for you instead of doing that why not
03:17 - watch cool stuff you could be building
03:19 - with code or maybe there's a new problem
03:23 - in coding that you've hit and now you're
03:25 - stuck so you're looking up how to solve
03:27 - it or you're looking at coding tutorials
03:29 - and you're eating food and looking at
03:31 - that at the same time all right so if
03:36 - you replace your car time and all that
03:39 - other nonsense so you replace your music
03:41 - with stuff about coding and you're
03:44 - watching stuff about coding and coming
03:45 - up with new ideas those are the easiest
03:48 - hacks so you can start implementing
03:49 - right now or also you could go to local
03:54 - meetups where there are other people who
03:56 - think about coding who dream about
03:58 - coding who love it and want to build
04:00 - amazing things now this is something
04:03 - important to you and you start applying
04:05 - all three of these things I just told
04:07 - you you know changing the circle of your
04:09 - friends because you know they say the
04:11 - five friends around you write the five
04:17 - closest people to you you're not only
04:22 - just the average of them but
04:25 - quantifiably that
04:27 - it's actually measurable and your
04:29 - average salary is also the average of
04:33 - the five people around you and how much
04:34 - they make okay
04:36 - so for those of you who like to think
04:38 - very objectively like me even if you
04:41 - don't believe that other whole thing
04:43 - about you're the average of the five
04:45 - closest people to you if you look around
04:48 - what their salaries are and you see what
04:49 - your salary is you're like whoa we're
04:52 - all really close that should be you know
04:55 - that should tell you something so if
04:58 - those people are not about coding or not
05:01 - passionate about their life or not
05:02 - trying to reach their goals or not
05:04 - trying to move themselves forward or not
05:06 - motivated and not motivating you and not
05:08 - believing in you maybe just maybe it's
05:13 - time to expand that inner circle to
05:17 - other people and those people who don't
05:20 - care for you or are there for you to
05:22 - make yourself feel comfortable but don't
05:24 - really push you or challenge you or move
05:26 - you to do new things maybe just maybe
05:29 - it's time to cut them out all right so
05:34 - you combine replacing music with books
05:36 - you combine or placing Netflix and the
05:40 - stupid you watch and you waste your
05:41 - time an average American spends 40 hours
05:44 - a week and my phone just died so my live
05:46 - stream is dead let's figure out what's
05:48 - going on with this bad boy but think
05:53 - about this okay average American spends
05:55 - 40 hours a week on TV so most of us
05:58 - complain about not having time we have
06:01 - time we just spend it on a lot of weird
06:04 - things and I'm not putting myself above
06:06 - it I do it all the time that's why I
06:08 - have these things in the back of my head
06:11 - because while I am teaching you and
06:13 - sharing this with you I'm mostly getting
06:16 - the most benefit for myself because it
06:18 - reminds me to do these things because
06:21 - I'm the one also who's not spending time
06:24 - doing the right things so if we can
06:27 - change our habits we can reverse
06:30 - engineer being motivated and passionate
06:34 - and being at that level that we want to
06:38 - be at and we don't have to condemn
06:40 - ourselves
06:41 - anymore for not having that passion or
06:43 - that motivation
