00:00 - is free code Camp worth it I came across
00:04 - an interesting video that I'm actually
00:05 - watching right now and I will break this
00:07 - down with you live and I'm going to have
00:09 - a lot of thoughts on it and this
00:10 - gentleman uh is also going to have lots
00:12 - of thoughts on it so let's go I say
00:15 - extrem is critical um of it and but I I
00:18 - want to back it up um so this all right
00:21 - so he's about to drop some critical
00:22 - facts on free code Camp let's get into
00:24 - it so there's a bit where he kind of
00:26 - rambles on for a while but his point was
00:28 - that he took 45 students that were his
00:31 - through free code camp and this is what
00:35 - he says their skills were like after he
00:37 - put his students through that course so
00:39 - I want you to just hear it yourself uh
00:42 - in my experience more education tools
00:45 - suck they totally suck and they don't
00:48 - teach you actual skills they teach you
00:50 - the theory or they get you to do a thing
00:52 - but they they didn't even know what
00:53 - index on HTML I'm not even kidding my
00:55 - friends my friends I am not making this
00:56 - up so that's pretty frustrating but it
00:59 - makes sense if you only learn on free
01:00 - code Camp you haven't even created a
01:03 - HTML file you don't know where it on
01:05 - your computer it goes so those things I
01:07 - do agree with let's keep hearing him and
01:08 - then I'll share more of my thoughts
01:11 - later not none of these people none of
01:14 - these people knew what to name the file
01:16 - they didn't even know what the file was
01:18 - or where it would go or why is it ending
01:20 - with HTML they may have known one or two
01:22 - or three or the tags that was in this
01:25 - was in
01:26 - 2019 that was in
01:28 - 2019 yep
01:31 - they was set up to go do this and then
01:32 - do this and then do this and all of the
01:34 - online for Education things like the
01:35 - gamified education and there's a bun I'm
01:37 - not even going to say there's a bunch of
01:38 - gamified Education right now regarding
01:40 - these kinds of things and the thing I
01:41 - worry about the most um is if someone's
01:43 - going to finish enough to do the thing
01:44 - another good example is vim Adventures
01:45 - Vim adventurers teaches you how to win
01:47 - the game so a couple of things I agree
01:50 - with him couple of things I don't agree
01:52 - with him he kind of gives me like
01:55 - the professor who's like kind of
01:58 - isolated himself under a rock type of
02:00 - Vibes like I understand his point
02:03 - of there's some parts I skipped but in
02:06 - the video you know if you watch it
02:07 - yourself he talks about like kind of
02:09 - memorizing certain things and and really
02:12 - understanding them so how does the
02:13 - structure of the HTML page work like the
02:15 - body and then the tags and where the
02:17 - head tag goes and script tag and um
02:21 - Etc but there are Parts where he's
02:23 - talking about gamification and I do
02:24 - think gamification is important and I do
02:26 - think those coding environments are
02:28 - important and code academy you know he
02:32 - he takes a stab at code academy and he
02:33 - took a stab at free code camp and my
02:36 - argument would be this did it help more
02:38 - people than it hurt that's one question
02:40 - the other question is if these tools
02:42 - didn't exist would there be more
02:43 - developers today or less developers
02:45 - today that would be another question and
02:47 - so when you look at it as a net was it a
02:49 - net positive or a net negative I would
02:52 - argue very strongly that it's a net
02:54 - positive now is everybody coming out
02:57 - like ninja [ __ ] Warrior level
02:59 - Developers black belts out of this no
03:02 - and does that also make sense where he's
03:04 - like they don't even know how to set up
03:06 - their own HTML files yes most likely but
03:09 - I'll also tell you this take somebody
03:11 - like my brother who has no interest in
03:13 - coding if I started having him set up an
03:15 - HTML file and then he had a Windows
03:17 - computer versus a Mac computer versus a
03:19 - Chromebook and he couldn't follow the
03:21 - tutorial or whatever if he's already
03:23 - scared of numbers and math stuff and
03:26 - he's a very creative smart person by the
03:28 - way I mean he has been doing a very high
03:29 - paying job for a very long time in a
03:31 - creative sector and but you know
03:34 - programming is not really his cup of tea
03:36 - so if I'm showing him that and he's
03:38 - doing that and he can't follow along he
03:39 - will just quit he will not want to do it
03:42 - you understand what I'm saying like he
03:43 - will not want to code whereas when I put
03:46 - him on something like code academy free
03:48 - code camp or you know any of these
03:50 - online for Education tools that he he's
03:52 - bashing
03:53 - on he will just continuously write the
03:56 - thing that they're telling him he'll
03:57 - make progress he'll feel like he's
03:59 - moving forward the gamification actually
04:01 - makes it fun a funny example my
04:03 - ex-girlfriend was a pro boxer a pro
04:06 - synchronized swimmer and just like a uh
04:09 - an athlete an Olympic level athlete her
04:11 - whole life now when I was teaching her
04:13 - coding when I was trying to teach her
04:14 - normally she was like she hated that
04:16 - right but then I found this game called
04:18 - code
04:20 - combat and code combat is basically and
04:24 - how I got her into it was I showed her
04:27 - code combat and code combat is a gam
04:31 - it's a game a video game based on with
04:34 - coding and so you know if there's an
04:36 - enemy you would say if enemy then attack
04:41 - and so she would write that and then she
04:43 - would attack the enemy and she would
04:45 - pick her syntax was whether it was
04:46 - JavaScript or python so the difference
04:48 - would be in Python she would use Whit
04:50 - spacing and indentation whereas in
04:53 - JavaScript she would do the semicolon
04:55 - and the closed pen and open pen and
04:57 - squigglies and
04:59 - and she started actually picking up
05:02 - programming that way because she was
05:03 - just solving puzzles and it was fun and
05:06 - she was starting to understand the
05:07 - logical part of how programming works
05:09 - and then later we could slowly start
05:12 - once her level of interest and
05:13 - excitement hers or my brothers is
05:15 - increased right take the average
05:17 - population not everybody's a hardcore
05:19 - wannabe programmer and just love
05:21 - everything about it once that starts to
05:23 - get increased then you start to
05:24 - incrementally introduce more and more
05:27 - complexity so like this guy is testing
05:29 - them for [ __ ] wrong things like if
05:31 - you're coming off of purely the
05:33 - simulation world like free code camp or
05:36 - whatever of course you're not going to
05:37 - know how to make a file on your computer
05:39 - cuz they've not done that so what is he
05:41 - getting out of testing that of course
05:44 - you're not going to know how to do that
05:45 - then you need an additional resource
05:47 - that then teaches you hey here's how you
05:50 - make a file on your computer here's how
05:52 - you do
05:53 - XYZ um and I also I want to hear him out
05:57 - but I also don't know what his like
05:59 - argument will be but you know just by
06:02 - feeling his vibe off of this video I
06:04 - feel like his argument would be like
06:06 - just shut everything out and uh you know
06:10 - uh live under a rock and just forget
06:12 - about these online simulations memorize
06:14 - code because that's what actually takes
06:16 - you to the next [ __ ] level I don't
06:17 - know I'm going to hear him out but I
06:21 - feel like if he had where I would be
06:23 - less pissed off because the reason why
06:25 - I'm pissed off is cuz
06:27 - like I want more people to learn and I
06:29 - want learning to become easier it's
06:31 - because of professors like these that
06:33 - try to make it hard just for the sake of
06:35 - it being
06:36 - hard and make the experience more on
06:39 - memorization which is a word that was
06:40 - used in the video it took out the fun of
06:44 - coding for people like me I didn't want
06:47 - to code for those reasons I wanted to do
06:49 - it because it was fun I was solving new
06:51 - problems and that was exciting it wasn't
06:53 - because here's how you make an exact
06:54 - HTML file and if you don't put HTML and
06:57 - you put hmtl the file breaks that stuff
07:01 - I learned later and I cared about all
07:03 - the technical stuff
07:04 - later using the command line to then
07:07 - make a file and touch a file and Etc and
07:09 - whatnot learning how to use Vim all
07:12 - those things I honestly cared about
07:13 - later once I discovered that programming
07:16 - was something even fun that I would I
07:17 - would even want to do so I did learn
07:19 - from corsera and Udacity and a lot of
07:22 - their platforms were just online
07:24 - education platforms and I did problem
07:26 - solve right within there but I still
07:28 - improved my problem solving skills and
07:29 - I'm badass today at programming but
07:32 - let's keep going I want to hear the
07:33 - gentleman out fully Adventures it
07:35 - doesn't teach you MIM and kids that had
07:37 - gone through Vim Adventures did not know
07:39 - how to edit a file using Vim in the
07:40 - terminal they had no idea because they
07:41 - never Associated the act of editing a
07:43 - file with the keystrokes that were
07:45 - happening from Bim adventures and the
07:46 - idea the idea the hypothesis behind a
07:48 - thing like Bim Adventures is oh these
07:49 - kids are going to master all these
07:50 - really great you know command line
07:51 - things the problem is that's not how
07:52 - your brain works your brain works by
07:54 - associating the task at hand with what
07:55 - you seeing that means you're looking at
07:56 - a terminal and you have a text file that
07:58 - needs to be edited what are the command
08:00 - okay so some points of agreement that I
08:02 - want to say there yes you're right if
08:04 - you are
08:05 - not using Vim on your command line
08:09 - you're not actually going to learn how
08:10 - to use it from playing that game I
08:13 - understand that that's a good point but
08:16 - here's what I will tell you the first
08:18 - time I was fascinated by vim and that
08:20 - made me want to learn Vim was because
08:23 - somebody sat me down I was at
08:26 - a co-working spot in Chicago it's called
08:28 - pumping St 1 PS1 I don't know if it
08:31 - still exists today or not great
08:33 - co-working spot and when I was there
08:35 - there was somebody that met me and was
08:36 - like yo you should learn them he was a
08:39 - senior developer he's like he going to
08:40 - Skyrock your ability Etc I thought I
08:42 - thought that was freaking cool I'm like
08:43 - I want to learn it so he brought me
08:46 - aside and he said I want you to learn
08:48 - Vim but check out this Vim Adventures
08:50 - play it for a day and then talk to me
08:52 - tomorrow and I just played Vim
08:53 - Adventures for a day and it was how to
08:56 - move my character with like a jkl
09:00 - um and or jkl sorry like how to move my
09:02 - character and basically just moving up
09:04 - and down left and right and Vim has its
09:07 - own set of um keys right how you move
09:10 - around and um I learned how to use move
09:13 - my character in that game and once I did
09:16 - I actually learned how to move around um
09:19 - and got comfortable with those
09:20 - keys then when I moved to an actual
09:24 - Visual Studio code it didn't translate
09:26 - over perfectly but one I was already
09:28 - introduced to the concept of how to move
09:30 - up down left and right without having to
09:32 - use arrows or something else uh the
09:34 - second thing I was already introduced to
09:36 - was like the fun aspect of it I was like
09:37 - this is actually fun I remember playing
09:39 - a game so I had positive emotions
09:41 - associated with Vim so before teaching
09:44 - and somebody learning something they
09:45 - have to be sold on learning that thing
09:47 - they have to actually want to do that
09:49 - thing so the first step to learning is
09:51 - building a desire you can't just start
09:53 - learning stuff that you don't have
09:54 - desire for and if you do it's a weak
09:56 - Foundation eventually you'll quit and
09:58 - you won't want to do that thing okay so
10:01 - that's an important thing to understand
10:03 - so when I'm learning vim and Vim
10:05 - Adventures while you're right it doesn't
10:08 - translate over one to
10:10 - one the first step you're actually doing
10:12 - with that is building the desire and the
10:14 - excitement for somebody and then you
10:16 - move them over into the command line the
10:19 - dark side of the you know the the
10:21 - programming world and then you you sneak
10:24 - them in it's kind of like if I was to
10:25 - introduce you to anime I won't be like
10:28 - bro let's sit down and watch parasite or
10:31 - some one of those crazy animes with like
10:33 - 15 freaking Seasons right code gas with
10:36 - like nine Seasons or whatnot the first
10:38 - thing I would do is be like let's watch
10:42 - uh Death Note you know let's watch like
10:44 - one of those mainstream anime so you can
10:46 - just kind of get into it Attack on
10:48 - Titans maybe and then you start watching
10:51 - like the crazier
10:53 - stuff so that's the way I think about it
10:57 - your fingers become associated with the
10:58 - movements and stuff to do that and that
11:00 - is exactly the same thing for web
11:01 - development if they had learned how to
11:03 - make a very simple web page and if I had
11:05 - walked them through using vs code or
11:06 - whatever to make an actual web page the
11:07 - same way an actual professional
11:08 - developer would do it then they would be
11:10 - building on actual skills using real
11:12 - tools and I cannot overstate how
11:14 - valuable that is because even if you
11:16 - learn the skill completely and you're
11:18 - doing it in the cloud on some
11:19 - educational website and you're not
11:20 - actually logging into a system where
11:22 - every single thing is the same then the
11:23 - pneumatic path the pneumatic yes that I
11:27 - agree with um I'm sorry I yeah sharing
11:29 - the screen okay good that I agree with
11:32 - yes if you don't do it in Visual Studio
11:34 - code at some point you know you have to
11:35 - switch over at some point and if you're
11:37 - not doing it at any point then yes those
11:39 - Pathways won't exist and you will be
11:41 - very confused when you actually go to
11:42 - the real grow so I 100% agree with that
11:44 - Pathways in your brain the neural
11:46 - Pathways and the neumatic uh pneumonic
11:47 - methods and stuff like that they're not
11:48 - going to work because your your brain is
11:50 - is used to associating all of this stuff
11:52 - the entire experience it's not just
11:54 - about knowing how to do X and Y command
11:56 - it's about having all the pieces be in
11:58 - sync so that when when you are put in a
11:59 - similar situation things there are a
12:01 - couple of areas where I've seen it more
12:02 - productive than others for example um
12:03 - code combat
12:05 - uh nice okay we agree on the code combat
12:08 - one that was something I was talking
12:10 - about earlier so thank you for bringing
12:11 - that up yes it is effective on the code
12:14 - combat and we are in agreement there
12:16 - that's cool that because they were doing
12:18 - coding and they had you know the actual
12:19 - syntax of the code that they were
12:20 - writing um you know they got they got
12:21 - better at writing that syntax but but
12:23 - they weren't solving real world problems
12:24 - they were solving you know a problem to
12:25 - help them beat beat the the monster so
12:27 - maybe correct that's true learn how to
12:28 - do recursion or something but it wasn't
12:30 - as effective in my opinion had they been
12:33 - you know solving their own problems I
12:34 - want to make a story game I want to make
12:36 - a something that accomplishes a
12:37 - particular goal of mine and and I agree
12:40 - with that too H if you associate it with
12:42 - your own problem you will learn more you
12:44 - will learn
12:46 - faster and you will retain the knowledge
12:50 - way more because it will be emotionally
12:52 - connected now with that said playing it
12:54 - as a game is the next closest thing to
12:57 - that because on one end you have a
13:00 - teacher handing you down a task and you
13:02 - have to do and that's one extreme of
13:04 - like you're forced to do
13:07 - something on the other end you have the
13:10 - Other Extreme which is you figuring out
13:12 - your own goal and your own desire so
13:14 - these are two extremes okay uh the
13:17 - teacher extreme is like you're feeling
13:19 - like you're forced to do stuff doesn't
13:20 - really feel good and then your extreme
13:22 - is the one that feels the best cuz you
13:23 - feel like you're coming up with it but
13:25 - it's really hard to come up with
13:26 - something in between that is something
13:29 - that makes it fun it feels like a game
13:31 - and you do it so when you're playing
13:33 - heads up with your friends imagine how
13:35 - motivated you are or when you're playing
13:37 - charades or when you're playing
13:38 - something like draw something and one
13:40 - person draws and the other person
13:41 - guesses what that thing
13:43 - is even though it's not a thing you came
13:46 - up with yourself you're very excited to
13:48 - play that game because of how that game
13:50 - works and it's giving you very
13:51 - interesting things to play off of so
13:53 - you're very motivated so I would say
13:56 - that it's better than learning in class
13:57 - because even the game gives you a task
14:00 - like hey defeat this enemy you're
14:02 - actually pretty motivated to defeat that
14:03 - enemy cuz you're like that is kind of
14:05 - aligned with my goal so it does build
14:08 - like an emotional connection though the
14:10 - strongest one would be if you fully came
14:11 - up with your own problem to solve and
14:14 - that just it's just much more visceral
14:15 - it's much more real it just tends to
14:16 - stick better so that's the end of the
14:17 - video really um I it's not to throw
14:19 - freeo Camp under the bus I understand
14:20 - that they've changed a lot but um the
14:21 - takeaway was I sent 45 people through
14:23 - free C Camp and only two of them could
14:24 - build a website afterwards a web page
14:25 - and those two had already learned how to
14:26 - do it before that that's the
14:30 - I don't know why you sound so defeated
14:32 - bro when you say that and the reason why
14:34 - I say that is because they're not
14:36 - supposed to have learned that like that
14:39 - is crazy that's like if I was like okay
14:43 - I want you to become a better
14:45 - fighter and I'm like but first you need
14:47 - to get your Jabs right so then I trained
14:50 - him I took him let's say I take you okay
14:54 - um and I'm like come on here you can
14:56 - leave your hoodie on cuz you already
14:57 - look so badass and I'm sure you're going
14:59 - to be good at fighting I put a punching
15:01 - bag in front of you and then I'm like
15:03 - okay throw your jab and throw your so
15:04 - you start throwing your Jabs and you
15:06 - start throwing your hooks like okay cool
15:09 - and I have you just train that for like
15:11 - two weeks 3 weeks four weeks and then
15:15 - the next day I just go all right son uh
15:18 - put on your gloves I'm going to put on
15:20 - my gloves let's Spar or I bring another
15:22 - fighter and I go okay you guys just Spar
15:25 - bro what do you think is going to happen
15:26 - you're going to get [ __ ] knocked on
15:27 - your ass you're going to gas out you're
15:31 - not even going to last a minute but are
15:33 - you going to be like I didn't get better
15:35 - at boxing no but you just didn't train
15:38 - for that environment so how do you
15:40 - expect to survive in the real
15:41 - environment but
15:43 - also you need to hit the bags too to
15:46 - actually improve your skill set to
15:48 - improve how you fight you can't not do
15:51 - bag work and so when you're looking at
15:54 - free code camp and other online
15:56 - resources they're very helpful cuz they
15:58 - strip away a lot out of the sparring
16:00 - right cuz in sparring I got to put my um
16:04 - the the I forget what what it's called
16:06 - but like the teeth thing we put right so
16:08 - you got to protect your teeth you got to
16:10 - put your head gear you got to put your
16:12 - gloves you got to wrap and you got to
16:15 - like you got to do all these things you
16:17 - got to warm up beforehand you can get
16:19 - too tired so there's a lot of this extra
16:21 - stuff so when you're coding on your own
16:23 - environment you got to set up your
16:24 - coding project you got to set up your
16:26 - folder structures you got to like set up
16:28 - whereas like if you're like dude I just
16:30 - want to solve a particular problem you
16:33 - free code Cam and these they just get
16:34 - you into the meat and potato of the
16:36 - problem so think of that as like hitting
16:39 - the bags or improving in chess for
16:41 - example right like I play chess I'm top
16:44 - 1% in chess and how I got good at it is
16:46 - by playing it of course and get and
16:49 - feedback over my games but I also got
16:51 - better because I do chess puzzles and so
16:53 - chess puzzles are like somebody else's
16:55 - game I solve that situation and then I
16:58 - just move on and sometimes it's not even
16:59 - somebody else's game and that pattern
17:02 - recognition comes into my own games and
17:05 - it helps me and then I can solve those
17:07 - tactics and like have a crushing
17:08 - combination that I can find because I I
17:10 - had done all these tactics beforehand
17:13 - that's how I think of like these online
17:15 - tools they're like helping you solve
17:16 - these tactics and they might not carry
17:19 - over 100% to the full game but these
17:22 - patterns do come into play so testing
17:25 - them on how to make a file and how to
17:27 - set up a folder structure when they did
17:29 - that zero times cuz they did free code
17:30 - Camp I think it's testing for the wrong
17:32 - thing but once the file structure is set
17:34 - up and once it start coding and once
17:36 - there is stuff and they have to add
17:38 - stuff or remove stuff or change stuff
17:40 - stuff that they have learned I bet you
17:42 - that that will still kick in and they'll
17:44 - still be able to do those things so
17:46 - those are just my thoughts I thought it
17:48 - was very entertaining I loved everything
17:50 - you said um even with the things I
17:53 - disagreed I respectfully disagree and uh
