00:02 - doing great
00:03 - we are back yet again
00:06 - with an amazing clone the tesla app
00:11 - clone
00:12 - welcome welcome everybody we are
00:14 - building the tesla app clone using react
00:19 - near that's correct as you guys can see
00:21 - what do we have here well we got the
00:23 - tesla app clone right here this is the
00:25 - app that i actually use
00:27 - and you can scroll through it it's using
00:29 - react native so you can use this on
00:31 - android on ios pretty much everywhere
00:34 - right you can go through it feels like
00:36 - it's actually buttons you know it's got
00:37 - everything right i can click to unlock
00:40 - click to lock
00:41 - most importantly what you'll be learning
00:43 - today is how to take an application and
00:45 - turn it into a native application right
00:48 - that is one of the hardest things to do
00:49 - so
00:50 - like i said this is the reactive and the
00:53 - react native clone the world building as
00:55 - you can see the way it kind of works is
00:57 - pretty simple right well it's kind of
00:59 - like any react.js project you have your
01:01 - app.js project hello hello welcome
01:03 - everybody good to see you here i see a
01:06 - lot of comments now at this point going
01:07 - going forward beautiful what's up what's
01:09 - up what's up usa usa
01:12 - yes yes yes yes yes why manual with the
01:14 - car
01:15 - menu over the car because that's how the
01:18 - actual tesla clone uh the tesla app
01:21 - works if you guys go check out the tesla
01:22 - app that's how it works in real life
01:24 - that's right
01:26 - thank you thank you family thank you i
01:28 - appreciate it my friend appreciate it
01:29 - appreciate it so guys this is like any
01:32 - other reactions applications you guys
01:34 - can see right we have our app.js which
01:36 - is right here okay which is right here
01:39 - and of course you know it has a view now
01:42 - instead of using something called divs
01:44 - we use views everybody view view and so
01:47 - forth okay
01:48 - now uh just like in every ids you can
01:50 - also import
01:52 - components you guys can see so i have my
01:54 - component called card item and this card
01:56 - item right here is basically all of this
01:59 - this is the card item you guys can see
02:01 - right here right
02:02 - that's the whole application that's
02:04 - inside that so if i click on the
02:05 - index.js for it as you can see we have
02:07 - all these different views right
02:09 - touchable views images and of course
02:12 - then we have like scroll view so this
02:13 - scroll view right here is what allows us
02:15 - to scroll through this application like
02:17 - it like like you see right here
02:18 - okay and this is yes this is live
02:20 - everybody if you guys are one this is
02:22 - live there's a reason why there's a red
02:23 - check mark there's a red circle around
02:25 - it guys i'm excited to believe this
02:27 - because this looks amazing
02:29 - how good does this look you know like
02:32 - the it feels like especially later on i
02:35 - can go ahead and download this that's
02:37 - right i can download this application
02:38 - and actually use it for example this is
02:40 - my uh you know you guys can see this is
02:42 - my little code right here i simply scan
02:45 - it with my phone i open this up and
02:46 - check this out guys
02:49 - if you guys can see this but i use it on
02:51 - my native application phone let me see

08:54 - beautiful that's it
08:56 - that's right bitcoin tesla is amazing
09:00 - this is amazing it's still building the
09:02 - javascript bundle so give it some time
09:04 - yeah the tesla like native applications
09:06 - that usually take a little longer to
09:08 - build guys than the normal applications
09:10 - but that's completely fine that's not a
09:11 - big issue here
09:13 - okay
09:14 - beautiful and just for safety brushes
09:16 - you see i did save the other application
09:18 - we had before i am using this mainly for
09:20 - reference so we can see what we are
09:22 - working on today right

09:41 - working on your app that is right it is
09:43 - pretty much
09:45 - i mean it's not done i was gonna be like
09:47 - peace out see ya
09:50 - uh if you have windows you need to
09:52 - install android studio guys
09:54 - worst case scenario if you don't have
09:56 - android studio nor do you have for
09:58 - example io simulator open up in the web
10:01 - browser and so you can work in a web
10:03 - browser as well so that's one your other
10:05 - option okay or you can just secure scan
10:07 - this barcode using your ios or android
10:09 - device and it will show up on your ios
10:11 - device but you need expo install for
10:13 - that one
10:14 - okay
10:15 - so cool let's go after json let's see
10:17 - what we have right now so this is it
10:19 - guys this is this is it this is app.js
10:21 - is where we are working from okay
10:24 - everybody
10:25 - now inside this application you guys can
10:27 - see what do we have well we have a few
10:28 - things as you can see that
10:31 - thank you so much victor appreciate that
10:33 - my friend says learning a lot from you
10:36 - thank you thank you thank you
10:38 - okay
10:39 - so as you can see we have a text we have
10:40 - a view which you know in regulator is
10:42 - pretty much like a div and all we are
10:44 - doing here this is the text so if i go
10:46 - ahead and remove this i say let's go
10:50 - and i say fire
10:52 - fire like this when i say this
10:55 - let's go fire you see so there you go
10:58 - now flutter is great uh fallout is great
11:00 - as well but regulative has become it's
11:02 - become very popular because it goes
11:03 - directly in native into ios and android
11:06 - so awesome let's go let's go beautiful
11:09 - so to get started guys what we need to
11:10 - figure out is how do we divide this
11:12 - application into multiple pieces right
11:14 - that's always how i start i usually
11:16 - start out with a few things well we've
11:17 - got kind of like this header section
11:18 - right here this header section right
11:20 - here right we have this section that
11:22 - does the the mileage and the status of
11:25 - the car we had the actual car if you
11:27 - actually have a tesla comment down below
11:29 - i'm curious if you have a tesla here
11:30 - anyway anyone has
11:31 - maybe you guys have driven a tesla who
11:33 - knows right this is our tesla logo and
11:36 - we have kind of a few uh controls we can
11:39 - use here
11:40 - you know like the fan
11:42 - the
11:43 - the this is the the key button this is
11:46 - the lock button and and so forth yes
11:49 - thank you thank you thank you appreciate
11:50 - this guys and of course here we have the
11:53 - media and a few other controls that we
11:55 - can use that's right that's right okay
11:58 - let's move forward
12:00 - now the first first i'm gonna i will be
12:02 - working on is i'm gonna create a
12:04 - component just for the car item itself
12:06 - right this whole card item is gonna be a
12:08 - view and i'm going to create this whole
12:10 - component for it and that's pretty much
12:12 - it so to create a component let's go
12:14 - ahead and create a new folder here
12:16 - called components it's a new folder
12:18 - called components
12:19 - boom okay and there you go and the site
12:22 - is comportable creating new folder
12:24 - inside here and called car item
12:28 - or are we called card item i think it's
12:30 - called cart
12:31 - cart
12:32 - yeah no it's car item that's right so we
12:35 - have new folder called card item inside
12:37 - this car item i will create a new file
12:39 - called index.js that's going to be our
12:41 - javascript
12:43 - okay
12:44 - and i'm also going to create a style.js
12:46 - everybody okay
12:48 - this is just a ui that is correct this
12:50 - is just the ui everybody yes i love it
12:52 - thank you so much thank you so much
12:53 - bitcoin
12:55 - i know javascript is insane the crazy
12:57 - stuff you can do with javascript
12:58 - nowadays right yeah it's it's crazy
13:01 - right so initial.js and then uh we're
13:04 - going to create a new file also called
13:07 - styles.js a new file called styles.js
13:12 - boom and done all right so every single
13:14 - you know um
13:16 - component kind of starts out it starts
13:17 - off with the bear structure so in our
13:20 - case it's going to start out with the
13:21 - following okay it's going to be
13:23 - r a f c e
13:25 - right here it's a react arrow function
13:28 - right it's a function component right
13:30 - that's what we need to build here okay
13:32 - so right there so this is our div of
13:34 - course now but we don't use div in the
13:36 - react native we use something called
13:37 - views okay
13:40 - let me go ahead and load this a little
13:41 - bit down so you guys can continue
13:43 - watching with me with this
13:44 - now for this view i'm going to imp i
13:47 - need to import this view actually for my
13:49 - purposes and i don't need to use here to
13:53 - import my view is going to be the
13:54 - following so here i'm going to do
13:56 - see here
13:58 - so we need to import the view from react
14:01 - native so i'll just say like this import
14:03 - right here i say view
14:06 - like let me know if you guys can see
14:08 - this actually
14:10 - from
14:11 - react
14:12 - native
14:17 - thank you so much
14:19 - thank you so much mr tom tanmai that's
14:22 - right that's right
14:23 - so important view from react native
14:26 - amazing okay
14:28 - and what we'll do is we'll just import
14:30 - this view like this
14:32 - view and we'll close it out with the
14:33 - view over here as well
14:36 - just like in any other react.js app
14:37 - project
14:38 - and at that point i need to import this
14:41 - into our app.js okay and to do that all
14:44 - we'll do is the phone will do import
14:46 - and i will say
14:48 - car item
14:50 - from
14:53 - from what
14:54 - i'm gonna do that slash you can see here
14:57 - i have different things i can do
14:58 - components and then slash what car item
15:02 - and i can do that index but because
15:04 - we're using index we don't actually
15:05 - specify index but i mean i'll do it
15:07 - anyways it's okay
15:09 - that's it
15:11 - first time yeah that's right first time
15:13 - right now that's amazing yeah yeah yeah
15:14 - yeah
15:16 - beautiful
15:17 - okay and then what we'll do is we need
15:19 - to go ahead and what use this now so i
15:22 - will do like this so car item
15:25 - that's how we use any you know
15:27 - components
15:28 - and it says now error object you likely
15:31 - forgot to export your component from the
15:33 - file it's defined and that's correct so
15:35 - if i go to nxgs i have to
15:37 - it's not there
15:39 - where's our
15:41 - oh we put our fast
15:44 - that's so funny we put our whole
15:45 - component into the style.js that's not
15:47 - correct we should put that into our
15:49 - index.js case
15:50 - okay there we go much better and now
15:52 - we'll call this
15:54 - call this uh car item
15:58 - save it
15:59 - beautiful it says uh expected a class
16:03 - book undefined that's okay don't worry
16:05 - don't worry and i will simply call it
16:08 - call this let's go
16:12 - beautiful
16:13 - beautiful
16:14 - now uh looks like it's still not working
16:17 - the way it should be that's totally fine
16:18 - so i will go to app.js car item looks
16:22 - like i'm importing my car item correctly
16:24 - from the components folder
16:26 - looks like that should be all good let
16:27 - me see if that's something wrong it's on
16:29 - my side
16:31 - closed car item i need to export default
16:34 - i think is what i need to do
16:36 - i need to export default
16:40 - right here save that
16:44 - default
16:47 - so i have my here i'm gonna do like this
16:50 - here
16:52 - i'm gonna say export
16:54 - default
16:55 - right car item
16:58 - boom
17:00 - and i'm gonna define my const here
17:05 - boom
17:06 - [Music]
17:07 - textures must be rendered within the
17:09 - text that's right and if i want to use a
17:11 - text now string like this i say text
17:14 - boom
17:15 - right so you cannot just put text just
17:16 - as is you have to use a text you know a
17:19 - text view now do the text you have to
17:21 - import it here as well every single time
17:23 - so this is where it gets a little bit
17:24 - different guys and here we have let's go
17:26 - you know in our new component okay
17:29 - right so for this specific portion guys
17:32 - the way kind of voices views are
17:33 - generally like divs and our text is like
17:35 - whenever you have a text you have to
17:37 - surround it with a text little uh text
17:39 - about a text component that comes with
17:41 - react native because remember a native
17:42 - is very different from like you're
17:44 - simply uh online you know web components

18:48 - in here i'm gonna put some text in here
18:50 - just so you guys see it okay and then
18:51 - we'll convert this into use an actual
18:53 - like font you know uh to use it to use
18:56 - actual icons
18:58 - so inside here i want to say here
19:00 - settings
19:01 - okay then i will say here i'm gonna call

19:22 - surprise
19:24 - i know i like it too
19:26 - surprise
19:28 - beautiful save that a
19:30 - beautiful now now we just started with
19:33 - the styles okay so we need to give some
19:34 - styles for this specific project now how
19:37 - do we create styles styles are actually
19:39 - created inside the styles.js guys right
19:43 - and so the way you'll do that is you
19:44 - actually need to import a style sheet so
19:45 - we'll do import here
19:48 - import and you need to import a style
19:50 - sheet that comes from react native from
19:53 - react native right so we'll say here
19:55 - style sheet
19:57 - style sheet like this okay and it's
20:00 - gonna come directly from
20:02 - react native
20:03 - right there see it's already done for
20:05 - you okay next thing we'll do is i'll do
20:07 - const styles
20:09 - is equal to i'm gonna say style sheet
20:12 - right
20:13 - style sheet dot create
20:16 - and boom and this is gonna be our style
20:17 - sheet now
20:19 - you might remind you something called
20:20 - style components guys that's what it
20:22 - might remind you off honestly right if
20:24 - you want to really think about it yeah
20:26 - that's kind of how i think about it
20:27 - sometimes honestly but you know it's all
20:30 - right
20:31 - now we have the style sheet container
20:32 - which is right here you see how they do
20:34 - it inside uh the main project we're
20:36 - going to simply delete that we don't
20:37 - need that anymore
20:42 - or what we can do is simply say
20:44 - yeah
20:46 - well
20:47 - that's fine you can still keep it access
20:49 - not not the biggest deal
20:50 - right so for our starship for the car
20:53 - container
20:54 - what we need to do is create a car
20:56 - container you know uh style okay let's
20:58 - go back to our gs and let's do here car
21:01 - container
21:04 - right and so forth and this is going to
21:06 - be this whole carton which is this whole
21:08 - container correct guys and we need to
21:10 - give it a width of 100 percent
21:14 - and
21:15 - actually
21:16 - yeah width of a hundred percent
21:20 - right here and we need to give it a
21:21 - height
21:23 - height of a hundred percent as well
21:26 - that's right
21:27 - that's right hey let's go
21:30 - and since we've given this card
21:32 - container a style but we need to
21:33 - actually
21:34 - give it a class i mean set a class tool
21:36 - right so if i say go to view instead of
21:39 - saying hey view class you know class
21:42 - name whatever you usually call it you
21:44 - have to say you know style equals so
21:47 - we'll say here style
21:49 - style equals something but what is it
21:51 - you might be asking well we need to
21:53 - import our style sheet so we'll say
21:55 - import styles
21:59 - styles from from what
22:04 - styles you see
22:06 - directly from here everybody guys
22:09 - then we say here style is equal to
22:11 - styles
22:12 - dot
22:13 - car
22:14 - no
22:15 - styles dot car container right here car
22:19 - container
22:21 - car container save that
22:23 - boom right now this is a style now if i
22:25 - give it for support like um let's just
22:27 - say a background color
22:29 - if i give it a background color here
22:33 - let's just say maybe it's like um
22:36 - let's see black
22:41 - does not oh it does not work actually
22:43 - because we did not export the styles
22:44 - everybody right so we need to export the
22:46 - styles as well so you need to go here
22:48 - into export
22:50 - default
22:53 - default i need to say styles
22:56 - boom save that hey you can see right
22:58 - there right that's about a color black
23:00 - if you wanted to you could do orange if
23:01 - you wanted to that's the no whatever you
23:03 - want orange
23:05 - save that hey we go see and so then we
23:07 - have our for example our nas and uh
23:09 - surprise all in there everybody guys see
23:12 - that
23:14 - see that okay
23:16 - opponent's header mate yeah that's right
23:17 - the third point the header the main and
23:19 - the list above that's a good one that's
23:20 - a good one
23:22 - okay this is the make your point that's
23:23 - correct this is the main component
23:24 - victory guys that's right
23:26 - beautiful so what is the next thing that
23:28 - we need to con to create we've got this
23:31 - view i'm going to also give it a style
23:33 - and that's going to be the header right
23:35 - so the actual header right i'm going to
23:37 - say styles
23:39 - style
23:40 - is equal to
23:41 - what
23:42 - styles dot header
23:44 - right the way the way you were literally
23:46 - just grabbing the styles is we're
23:48 - referencing back
23:49 - from what from the styles that's in here
23:52 - going into the side here and then
23:54 - checking up these styles right here
23:56 - right and i have it very careful because
23:58 - styles and react native are a little bit
24:00 - different styles in like react.js or on
24:01 - the web guys
24:04 - that's right good good good good good so
24:06 - flex one i'll
24:07 - i'll tell you guys about flex one later
24:09 - on don't worry
24:10 - all right now styles ahead let's create
24:12 - our style for the header right here i'm
24:14 - gonna say here
24:16 - comma i'm gonna say header
24:20 - all right continue one and for the
24:22 - header well a few things we need to do
24:25 - you see how there's a lot of likes
24:27 - because we had this notch
24:29 - you know we have to really push down
24:32 - this whole
24:33 - this whole little uh you know uh
24:36 - container using m margin so what i want
24:39 - to do is i'll say margin top
24:42 - boom and it's a margin top of 50. now i
24:44 - don't see 50 pixels here because it's a
24:46 - little bit different here in rec native
24:48 - instead you just say 50.
24:51 - header see here does it work styles that
24:54 - header
24:56 - margin top 50.
25:00 - i did that okay good so i just need to
25:02 - save it so styles the header great marta
25:04 - 50.
25:05 - okay awesome next thing we need to do is
25:07 - i'm going to give it a margin left 20 as
25:10 - well so we'll say margin
25:12 - left get some spacing on the left side
25:15 - as well
25:16 - of 20.
25:18 - again might be very different because we
25:19 - don't have pixels here okay
25:22 - save that that put pushes it a little
25:24 - bit on the side right here boom
25:26 - and then we have the what we're gonna
25:28 - give it a margin right
25:30 - of 20 as well
25:32 - good
25:33 - good awesome okay now at this point i'd
25:36 - be wondering okay well nas that's
25:38 - awesome what do we do with these icons
25:41 - but before we go into icons guys i want
25:43 - to figure out how do we put these
25:44 - settings you know from left to right if
25:46 - you remember guys we have something
25:47 - called display flex that's correct right
25:50 - one of the best things in the world
25:52 - display flex right for us right in order
25:55 - for us to go you know to flex it in a
25:58 - direction like this we say what flex
26:01 - direction
26:02 - row so that's exactly what we need to do
26:04 - if i go back to here i'm going to say
26:05 - the following i'm going to say here
26:08 - header comma
26:10 - flex
26:12 - direction
26:13 - is gonna be row
26:15 - check this out
26:17 - row
26:18 - save that you see now it goes from left
26:20 - to right which is exactly what we want
26:21 - if we look at our actual application you
26:23 - see right here from left to
26:25 - the door so it goes three div items left
26:28 - to right you guys see that
26:30 - great
26:32 - awesome
26:34 - the next thing we need to do is after
26:36 - that we need to go ahead and
26:39 - space these things out and if you don't
26:41 - if you know the way to space things out
26:43 - we say what we say
26:45 - justify
26:46 - content
26:48 - what
26:49 - just like content we say space between
26:52 - it's gonna push things to the side as
26:54 - much as possible okay so if i see here
26:57 - space between
27:02 - why not flex direction horizontal
27:04 - because that's not a that is not a
27:07 - a property that we can use that's not a
27:09 - value that it does not exist in flex
27:12 - direction it's only a row or column
27:15 - if i do space we can check this out guys
27:17 - between save it and boom you see it
27:19 - pushes into the side right away okay
27:22 - okay
27:23 - next thing we need to do is i'm going to
27:24 - push put these vertically aligned item
27:26 - center
27:28 - like this i'm gonna say align items
27:32 - center
27:33 - boom
27:35 - good
27:36 - oh items
27:39 - there we go now
27:42 - let's talk about um well these little
27:46 - cog wheels or you know the little icons
27:48 - right because where do we get these
27:50 - icons that we have right here
27:52 - and honestly they came from one place
27:54 - and we're gonna use something called
27:55 - font awesome anybody here here you have
27:57 - used font awesome if you guys use pandas
27:59 - and let me know
28:00 - i'm really curious okay

32:04 - will do yarn start again here yarn start
32:09 - one more time
32:14 - to make sure it's all good nice yes

32:22 - called you know
32:24 - is it
32:25 - what is it called one let me see here
32:27 - what you can think

33:24 - here
33:26 - i will say sometimes it can be a little
33:27 - bit tricky expo start cli again

33:37 - installed without dependency pocket.json
33:40 - okay
33:41 - let me see if i got json here

42:52 - want to do is i want to give uh this cog
42:54 - wheel and these icons a little bit more
42:57 - of a size
42:58 - so to give a this font awesome icon the
43:01 - size all you need to do is specify just

43:23 - that portion i love it um i want to
43:25 - change up these now colors you see how
43:27 - it's currently like a black color when i

43:30 - because if i scroll back
43:32 - white color you guys can see it right
43:34 - here exactly got it nice
43:37 - right so to make that happen what are we
43:40 - going to do very simple give it a what e
43:43 - style everybody let's go ahead and go to
43:45 - styles.js
43:46 - i'll do the same thing here and i'm
43:48 - going to say here the i'm going to call
43:50 - this
43:52 - the icon yeah why not just i'll just
43:54 - call the icon so i'm gonna say
43:56 - style here
43:58 - style is equal to
44:00 - styles dot icon
44:02 - now i send icon
44:06 - playlist for android icon right here
44:09 - okay
44:09 - same thing goes with the other one so
44:11 - i'm gonna say styles
44:14 - styles dot
44:16 - no style
44:19 - is equal
44:20 - to
44:22 - down with the icon
44:32 - icon awesome sweet save that command s
44:35 - on that one okay and then what what will
44:38 - i do well i will simply go back to
44:39 - app.js
44:41 - okay and actually no style to yes and
44:43 - let's say here
44:48 - i'm gonna say here what icon
44:50 - boom and for this i can always say is
44:52 - the color i'll just say color it's going
44:54 - to be white
44:56 - that's it guys save that
44:58 - hey now it's white color the next thing
45:00 - i want to work on is
45:02 - they're going to be the background okay
45:04 - the background's gonna be awesome uh
45:05 - because it has like actually we made a
45:07 - special background so that it mimics the
45:10 - actual application because if you look
45:11 - at the application let me show you right
45:13 - this is the actual app i know it's crazy
45:15 - this is the actual app right here right
45:17 - it's crazy you might see it maybe you
45:19 - don't let me see
45:20 - maybe it will uh come on focus right
45:23 - here right so we need to be able to
45:24 - build this as this right here okay
45:28 - and we have something called for you at
45:30 - the bottom down description guys we have
45:33 - for you the assets we have a background
45:35 - and then we have for you like a battery
45:38 - icon okay so if you go down the
45:40 - description you will have a
45:42 - google drive folder like this and all
45:44 - you need to do you will control it it
45:47 - will literally just be like this right
45:48 - here and it has assets and there's one
45:50 - more thing inside here which you will
45:52 - later on see it's called items.gs which
45:54 - is important for our menu okay
46:00 - so
46:01 - it's actually pretty interesting so ryan
46:02 - said will this actually work as a
46:05 - test lab so
46:07 - it's impossible for you to create a
46:09 - full-on tesla clone because of course
46:11 - their code is very hidden and in order
46:13 - to be able to access their code you have
46:14 - to be able to one i know i mean it's
46:17 - it's pretty crazy so this is simply just
46:18 - like a view of what you can do right but
46:21 - of course we're not building an actual
46:23 - tesla where you can use it for your own
46:26 - tesla you know car if you have one
46:29 - that's
46:30 - that's downright to say right now is
46:31 - pretty much impossible
46:34 - pretty much impossible guys right that's
46:36 - just that's how it is i mean they want
46:38 - to protect their cars you know it makes
46:39 - sense
46:40 - so what do you guys want to do you want
46:41 - to download this whole folder tesla
46:44 - clone assets like we call it again it's
46:46 - down down
46:47 - below in the description guys
46:50 - it's going to be zipping up the file for
46:52 - me
46:53 - right here beautiful
46:54 - good good good good
46:56 - beautiful
46:57 - so then at that point what i want to do
46:59 - is open this one up
47:02 - nice and get the tesla clone assets
47:04 - right here everybody see that yeah
47:07 - right there beautiful tesla clone assets
47:09 - all you want to do you can see we played
47:11 - around with just trying to
47:14 - do two sensors or something no no this
47:15 - is this is not connected sensors guys at
47:17 - all
47:19 - though that would be cool
47:20 - right
47:21 - now in terms of assets right here you
47:23 - guys can see we have all these little
47:24 - assets in terms of png icons but i want
47:26 - you what i want you guys to do is take
47:28 - this background and this battery and
47:30 - just move them into the asset folder
47:33 - that's it just move them to the access
47:35 - folder for now
47:36 - and the items that yes since you're here
47:38 - already feel free to move well don't
47:41 - worry don't worry about that is the gs
47:43 - just yet okay
47:44 - that will come later on guys so that's
47:47 - it everybody got that little link let me
47:48 - know down below you got that link guys
47:50 - that'll be awesome
47:52 - and that's it
47:53 - now to create the background image right
47:56 - all you got to do is let's go back to
47:58 - nsfgs and there's something called the
47:59 - background like it's actually just
48:01 - called a background image inside um you
48:04 - know tesla inside of react native so i'm
48:06 - going to say image background and again
48:08 - you need to import this from the view
48:10 - i'm gonna say image
48:12 - background like this
48:14 - okay
48:14 - save that and now we'll do is default
48:17 - i'm gonna say here to do i'm to say
48:19 - image background
48:21 - background like this right and of course
48:24 - it has a source
48:27 - and it also has a style
48:30 - which
48:31 - we're going to give it as well so for
48:32 - the style i'm going to say it's going to
48:34 - be styles.background image
48:37 - the background
48:41 - style the background
48:45 - image
48:48 - that's right if tesla exposed the api
48:50 - maybe then maybe we can use that that
48:53 - would be cool if i did you guys should
48:54 - talk to them
48:56 - i'm gonna close this out
48:58 - right here
49:00 - for the source we need to actually give
49:01 - it a source now right now for the source
49:03 - we need to require an image so we're
49:05 - going to do is i'm going to say require
49:07 - here
49:08 - okay
49:09 - and inside require you i'm going to say
49:11 - require and requires basically we're
49:13 - bringing in our actual you know um our
49:16 - actual image so kind of like this now i
49:19 - need to use dot dot slash because i'm
49:21 - trying to get out you see i'm currently
49:22 - inside the index.js for me to get out of
49:24 - index.js i have to go back up to cart
49:27 - item right here then from there i need
49:29 - to go back into components folder and
49:31 - then from there to go back into the
49:32 - assets folder so i need to
49:36 - back out of my folder two times that's
49:38 - how we navigate you know folders and do
49:40 - dot slash
49:42 - then dot dot slash again and that now
49:44 - you see i'm inside here which lies into
49:47 - this
49:48 - slash what
49:50 - i can say now slash background
49:57 - background dot uh png
50:01 - save that let's see
50:02 - it says undefined
50:05 - what
50:06 - undefined
50:08 - uh
50:09 - define undefined is not an object it's
50:11 - okay to find a non-object a source it
50:14 - does seem to be all good let me see here
50:18 - i got the png it looks like the beat
50:19 - that's all good
50:22 - i got
50:24 - um
50:28 - things to style now let me see what if i
50:29 - remove this certain portion that work
50:32 - okay that works
50:33 - okay it's okay let's see let's go back
50:35 - to here
50:39 - i think i think because it requires a
50:41 - width slash height so we need to go back
50:43 - into our styles for the image background
50:44 - and give it a width and a height okay
50:47 - so let's do background image
50:50 - let's go to background background image
50:53 - inside our styles
50:54 - i will say here comma
50:57 - background not color
51:00 - by image
51:02 - oh
51:02 - i'm going to say here width
51:05 - of a hundred
51:06 - percent boom
51:09 - boom
51:10 - and then when i say height of 100 as
51:11 - well
51:15 - ikea's giving me the
51:17 - the semicolon because it thinks it's css
51:20 - but it's not
51:22 - save that there we go so there you go
51:24 - guys this is our image i mean look how
51:27 - good is that by the way yes we created
51:28 - just for you that's right that's right
51:30 - we did
51:31 - so that's a pretty sick looking image
51:33 - honestly yeah i agree with that and of
51:35 - course you know to make this image look
51:38 - even better we can resize this because
51:39 - sometimes for example maybe you have a
51:40 - bigger display right and you want to
51:43 - resize this maybe a little bit better so
51:44 - you can use like resize mode
51:47 - resize mode and you use reset mode of
51:50 - what or for example like
51:52 - cover
51:54 - cover right
51:55 - cover
51:56 - save that
51:57 - and then now here's the issue now
51:59 - because this you see the thing is now is
52:03 - this
52:04 - yes this is hidden and now our text is
52:06 - gone if you guys can see our nsl gs you
52:10 - can see the art text has nowhere to be
52:11 - found this one why because it's actually
52:13 - all the way down below somewhere over
52:15 - there okay it's somewhere like over
52:18 - there and because this this whole
52:21 - background image is covering it you see
52:22 - guys
52:23 - now
52:24 - to make this not be like that
52:27 - we position it absolutely so that it's
52:30 - underneath
52:31 - it's actually underneath the whole thing
52:33 - okay underneath the whole you know it's
52:35 - a it's actually is viewed as a
52:37 - background image so for example let me
52:39 - show you if i go to our styles and i say
52:41 - here position
52:44 - it's kind of like you position
52:45 - absolutely position in the web as well
52:47 - same situation remember it will take its
52:50 - own div out of context
52:52 - and put it behind everything else or
52:54 - position absolutely to some sort of a
52:56 - div right
52:59 - save it boom you see now this right away
53:02 - came because why these things have
53:04 - structure but when you position absolute
53:07 - something it has no structure anymore it
53:10 - just almost like clings on to something
53:11 - and that's pretty much it that's kind of
53:12 - how you want to think about it
53:15 - that's right thank you we got to 1
53:16 - million subscribers so guys
53:20 - give this a like guys would really much
53:21 - appreciate this for the million
53:22 - subscribers guys we worked really hard
53:24 - and we still are working really hard to
53:25 - continue giving you guys as much value
53:28 - as possible so if you guys would like
53:29 - that would be much appreciated all right
53:31 - let's assure this youtube algorithm and
53:33 - uh yeah because you know sometimes
53:35 - youtube algorithm is just not good
53:37 - sometimes it's good sometimes it's not
53:38 - depending on the date
53:40 - but yeah but we want to just yeah thank
53:42 - you guys all right so that's all good
53:44 - it's looking much better already next
53:46 - thing i want to work on is going to be
53:47 - this right here

57:12 - whole image again now we need to do um
57:16 - yes a lot of them are yes are going to
57:17 - be images that's correct right so what
57:20 - we need to do to do now is kind of like
57:22 - the following we need to go ahead and
57:24 - replace this
57:26 - and make this image a little bit smaller
57:28 - so let's now go back to styles.js
57:33 - comma and we'll say battery image
57:37 - image and what width and height do we
57:39 - want to use well a few things well

58:05 - much better and then and that's pretty
58:07 - much it but now on the battery section
58:09 - though right you guys see that we have
58:10 - from left you see how it's kind of top
58:12 - to bottom it's because of flex direction
58:14 - by default every view has display flex
58:17 - on it so we need to set the flex
58:19 - direction from top to bottom to left to
58:21 - right using what flex direction row
58:24 - that's correct let's go back to here
58:27 - right i'm going to say here battery

73:10 - we've got the fa lock we've got the fa
73:12 - key we've got the fa fan looking good on
73:15 - that side and
73:17 - now let's go ahead and just simply style
73:19 - them out let's go back to style.js and
73:22 - we need to do is let me see here
73:25 - icon icon border three icons right here
73:28 - now for these specific icons a few
73:30 - things to happen well you see how you do
73:33 - they're currently kind of like this they
73:35 - need to go from column down to
73:37 - row everybody and so for that to happen
73:40 - all we say here is the following we say
73:42 - here um control con
73:45 - see here
73:46 - let's go
73:47 - controls
73:49 - here go controls
73:51 - let's go back to here say controls
73:55 - boom
73:56 - boom
73:56 - and inside the controls inside the
73:59 - controls we do we're going to do flex
74:01 - direction because by default flight
74:02 - direction is column
74:06 - row
74:07 - good save that
74:10 - [Music]
74:13 - the network
74:14 - flex direction
74:18 - control con all controls right here
74:22 - right there save that nice okay
74:25 - and then i'm going to say justify
74:26 - content center so it's center
74:28 - horizontally
74:30 - good
74:34 - click content center
74:38 - hey that's what i'm talking about okay
74:41 - and what we need now to focus on is
74:43 - individual buttons in my case and and my
74:46 - key is going to be these the icon board
74:49 - right here okay let me see here
74:52 - [Music]
74:54 - so
74:55 - for the actual buttons it's going to be
74:57 - a little bit harder because we need to
74:58 - create a circle around everybody right
75:00 - that's what i need to create so
75:02 - if i go and copy this controls button
75:04 - that's the cell i'm going to use
75:06 - let's go back to my style and i'm going
75:08 - to say controls button right here
75:11 - boom done got it
75:13 - okay
75:15 - it's controls button now for this you
75:18 - see we number one we need to we need to
75:20 - give it like a a little bit of a border
75:22 - but
75:23 - i want to give this pork test i feel
75:25 - like there's like not enough margin here
75:28 - i'm going to give this a lot a lot of
75:30 - margin i feel like
75:32 - so that it will push this whole view
75:34 - down
75:35 - this whole view of controls down right
75:38 - everybody
75:39 - yeah that's what i think
75:40 - that's what i think i need to do
75:42 - so
75:43 - i will that will i will make that happen
75:45 - later on in a second here but for now
75:47 - let's just focus on this portion
75:52 - okay
75:53 - controls button i'm going to get this
75:55 - out of control i'm gonna say border
75:56 - number one i'm gonna give it a border so
75:59 - border uh
76:01 - style of c
76:03 - border
76:04 - width
76:06 - right it's gonna be one pixel
76:10 - okay
76:11 - that's right i'll even margin the top
76:12 - right guys yeah i agree with that one
76:13 - right
76:14 - then i'm gonna say border color
76:19 - color is gonna be white
76:23 - okay save that beautiful then i'll say
76:26 - border style okay that's solid
76:27 - automatically i'm gonna say border now
76:29 - radius
76:32 - order radius
76:35 - is going to go to 50
76:38 - to 50.
76:41 - nice you see now it's going to become a
76:42 - circle
76:43 - right and i'm going to say well and
76:45 - honestly that's and then for every
76:47 - single border of obviously a little
76:48 - thing i'm going to say
76:50 - um
76:52 - padding
76:54 - padding is now 18 because this will
76:57 - create some spacing inside of it there
76:59 - we go now we've got some a little bit
77:01 - better right here and i'm going to say
77:02 - here margin left
77:07 - margin

78:05 - okay ready so 50 that's right technology
78:07 - stalker and 20 pixels that's okay
78:11 - we made that round 25.
78:13 - now to make them clickable guys who
78:14 - remembers what i need to do to make them
78:15 - clickable remembers we need to do what
78:19 - touchable opacity again so touchable
78:21 - opacity
78:23 - let's put that around what around the
78:26 - whole view
78:28 - like this touchable opacity
78:31 - on every single view right
78:35 - boom
78:36 - boom save that
78:38 - next one boom
78:40 - come on x
78:43 - tap it out
78:45 - and boom and
78:47 - save that next one
78:51 - touchable opacity boom boom
78:55 - boom
78:56 - good tap it out
78:59 - save that
79:00 - there we go my friends
79:02 - that's it
79:05 - there is no display there's no display i
79:07 - mean
79:08 - i'm not sure if there is a display grid
79:10 - or not that's a good question i'm not
79:12 - sure there's display grid all i know is
79:13 - that we have display flex and react
79:15 - native by default every single view that
79:18 - we see on here like this view this view
79:20 - every single thing is display flex right
79:23 - away so
79:25 - i'm not sure if it's fully you know this
79:28 - display grid or not i don't think so i'm
79:29 - not sure i might be wrong though if you
79:31 - guys know that'd be great
79:35 - that's right that's right that's right
79:37 - so then okay so we got this now look at
79:39 - this if i click on this a and now it
79:41 - feels like an actual button everybody an
79:43 - actual button
79:44 - now one really cool thing that we can do
79:46 - guys okay one little thing we can do
79:48 - because we can change up this button oh
79:51 - i can actually do this that's
79:52 - interesting i can zoom in
79:54 - one thing we can do is change up this
79:56 - right here
79:59 - to this whole thing so that it's
80:00 - actually locked and not unlocked every
80:02 - time i click it so for example
80:04 - if i click on this i want to be able to
80:06 - change it to an unlock button how are we
80:08 - going to do that well
80:10 - to do that what we'll do is
80:12 - is we need to create a state of making
80:15 - sure when is it actually locked not
80:16 - locked so if i go to my here control you
80:19 - see this touchable opacity
80:21 - right let's figure out what is the
80:23 - current state of our lock right well in
80:25 - use day i'm gonna import you stay here
80:27 - from react
80:30 - say use date
80:32 - beautiful save that
80:35 - and inside here i will create the
80:37 - following i will say okay const locked
80:40 - i'm going to create a used call locked
80:42 - set locked
80:44 - boom
80:45 - is equal to use state right what is the
80:48 - current state
80:50 - what is the current state of our lock
80:52 - die a locked icon
80:54 - that's right so i'm going to say use
80:56 - date of maybe a false for now maybe our
80:58 - car is unlocked so i'll say false here
81:01 - okay
81:02 - and we can use that now to actually
81:04 - change something up so for example
81:07 - here's what i'm gonna do
81:08 - inside this font awesome icon faa log
81:11 - i'm actually just gonna simply say a
81:14 - javascript um infidel statements okay
81:19 - so you understand react.js first before
81:21 - watching this live no honestly
81:24 - you can just you watch this live have
81:26 - fun see how regular works i call it as
81:29 - oh you know i call i sprinkle this it's
81:30 - like a sprinkling at you guys i'm kind
81:32 - of putting seeds into your brain that's
81:34 - what i call it right uh it's okay to put
81:36 - seeds into your brain that's okay you
81:37 - know that way you know what to do next
81:39 - time
81:40 - okay
81:42 - boom
81:45 - this is better probably i think right no
81:47 - all right okay cool next one uh
81:50 - what this want to do is the following i
81:52 - will say here icon i'm gonna say if the
81:55 - icon if it's a lot the state is locked
81:57 - question mark this is a shortcut for the
81:59 - if all statement guys
82:01 - the statement is locked
82:03 - i'm going to use the locked icon which
82:05 - is the what the fa lock this one
82:08 - right let me see here i will say i'm
82:11 - gonna use the fa lock icon however
82:13 - otherwise if it's not locked
82:17 - i will use a different icon and the icon
82:19 - i'm gonna use for the unlocked one is
82:21 - gonna be let me see here make sure i get
82:23 - it fully
82:26 - it's going to be the
82:28 - total
82:30 - make sure i got it it's going to be the
82:32 - fa unlock alternative right here
82:35 - command c
82:37 - you guys want to go ahead and import
82:38 - this
82:39 - it's a little bit bigger
82:42 - let me import this inside here everybody
82:45 - okay
82:47 - all right and i will go back to the
82:49 - bottom and if i say here fa unlocks so
82:52 - what does this do it says the following
82:53 - hey
82:54 - if it's locked
82:56 - and you can see everybody changed look
82:57 - at this
82:58 - you see it changed right away guys
83:00 - what is the stat what does this tell you
83:01 - well basically if it's locked you will
83:04 - use fa lock however otherwise if it's
83:06 - not locked you'll use a fa unlock
83:08 - alternative that's all it is
83:11 - now
83:12 - there you go you see we have this is
83:13 - it's a press nothing happens but it's
83:15 - currently unlocked if i set this to true
83:20 - that's not what i want to do then look
83:22 - then now it's a lock button you guys see
83:24 - that beautiful but how do you
83:27 - but how do you go ahead and
83:30 - actually do something with this so i'm
83:32 - going to use this
83:34 - and i need to create a function on the
83:36 - press of this touchable opacity so on
83:39 - this touchable opacity i can actually
83:41 - specify here
83:43 - unpress of what i will say unpress

84:09 - let's go to a function of course
84:16 - and basically i'm going to say the
84:16 - following every time i click on this i
84:18 - want to do the opposite whatever i'm
84:20 - doing so if my car is currently locked
84:24 - i'm going to unlock it i'm going to say
84:26 - set
84:27 - locked to

84:47 - i have to go back to my own press and i
84:48 - say
84:49 - click lock
84:53 - save that a beautiful now look at this
84:55 - if i now click on this guys ready watch
84:57 - this one watch this one click on it oh
85:00 - oh you see small change but it shows you
85:03 - that this is the unlock unlock section
85:05 - so if i click on it again
85:06 - now it's locked
85:08 - now it's unlocked
85:09 - and actually if you look at the test lab
85:11 - and this is i'll show you a tesla app
85:12 - right here
85:14 - this is the tesla app for sure the if i
85:16 - show the real tesla app
85:18 - which is actually this one
85:21 - looks like there's maintenance going on
85:22 - right now which is actually this one if
85:24 - i i can click on an actual button oh you
85:27 - guys don't see it right now
85:29 - look at the actual button you will see
85:31 - it right there
85:32 - still updated right now but it will
85:34 - actually do the same thing as what we're
85:36 - doing right now
85:38 - what does this be written it's usually
85:40 - using something called react native
85:41 - everybody react native right by that's
85:44 - right
85:45 - okay so this is literally you guys are
85:47 - building for android and ios that's
85:49 - correct right so we have this set locked
85:52 - unlocked and you can click on this
85:56 - as much as you want no problem so ever
85:59 - the next thing i want to focus on which
86:00 - can be the harder portion
86:02 - is this menu right here this menu right
86:04 - there
86:06 - okay so everybody strip the strap down
86:08 - settle down let's go ahead here the next
86:10 - portion
86:13 - okay now for this menu i'm actually
86:15 - gonna create a new component
86:17 - right here
86:18 - i'm gonna create new components for this
86:20 - menu i will insert my components folder
86:22 - i'm going to say new folder
86:24 - because i just want to do that and i'm
86:26 - going to say menu
86:28 - manu
86:29 - inside here we'll do a new file called
86:31 - index.js
86:34 - okay and we'll also create a style.js
86:37 - style.js beautiful
86:40 - beautiful thank you thank you thank you
86:42 - thank you for the buddy
86:45 - bro ad carmel what is that recording 403
86:48 - guys three 403 likes guys 500 come on
86:52 - come on you got this
86:54 - okay so we had the nfl gs same thing
86:56 - here i'm gonna say
86:57 - uh rfc see
87:02 - here
87:06 - i'm gonna do a little bit differently
87:07 - here
87:08 - const
87:10 - cons menu
87:13 - is equal to this i'm gonna say export
87:15 - default
87:17 - default manu
87:19 - my new
87:20 - that's it okay
87:22 - beautiful
87:25 - what is better a quick question what is
87:27 - better a if else or ternary operator so
87:30 - turning operators that you like to use
87:32 - for like very fast um turning operators
87:34 - are really great for you want to display
87:37 - different things
87:38 - so turning operators are amazing for
87:40 - example just how you have right here
87:41 - guys you can see here
87:43 - i use a turnaround operator for this
87:45 - portion
87:46 - you see
87:47 - you're not going to say if else
87:48 - statement inside here you're honestly
87:50 - not going to do that that's just you
87:51 - know it's not clean at all yo sean
87:53 - what's up my friend good to see you
87:55 - right it's actually not going to happen
87:56 - at all you instead you want to use a
87:58 - turner operator for this one because
87:59 - again it makes it clean it's easy to use
88:02 - and if you do if bunch of if else
88:03 - stables it's just going to be a really
88:05 - hard and complicated right so we don't
88:07 - want to do that that's the only reason
88:09 - why you use turner operator okay
88:12 - so we have now the menu here and this
88:14 - menu is going to be a view
88:18 - view same thing here called view
88:22 - view okay let's go ahead and import that
88:24 - view into our car item
88:28 - right here
88:29 - right i'm gonna say here view view view
88:31 - you view
88:34 - and i'm gonna say import
88:38 - menu
88:41 - menu from what from what
88:44 - import menu from well this is the tricky
88:47 - portion right i need to get out of car
88:49 - item
88:50 - i need to go back into the menu slash
88:52 - index
88:53 - boom save it okay got everybody
88:57 - then i can now actually use it i can go
88:58 - to here and i can say here uh my new
89:02 - menu
89:04 - i'm gonna say here
89:05 - i'm gonna say menu
89:07 - i'll give myself a little comment below
89:09 - so i can know what i'm talking about
89:11 - i'm gonna say here too
89:13 - oh menu
89:15 - what's that right away
89:17 - boom
89:18 - cannot find the variable

89:37 - views okay every single thing you need
89:39 - to import directly okay
89:42 - that's right
89:44 - very very trending
89:46 - i mean uh react native is built for ios
89:49 - and android so it's very very different
89:50 - than like pwa like you know one page
89:53 - applications so progressive web apps i
89:55 - mean i don't know
89:58 - which one is different progressive web
90:00 - apps or react native both are really
90:02 - useful

101:03 - small margin so i'm going to add a small
101:06 - margin to the actual menu

102:38 - honestly that's pretty much it in terms
102:39 - of alignment now let's focus on the
102:41 - alignment inside
102:42 - the menu row as well that's right so for
102:45 - the menu row i'm going to say here
102:50 - margin top here
102:53 - margin top
102:56 - margin top of gonna be 15 pixels
103:00 - because i want every single thing to
103:01 - have a you know spacing in between each
103:03 - of the specific things okay
103:05 - now let's focus on the menu text here
103:08 - now the menu text
103:12 - the menu text right here my new
103:15 - text
103:17 - okay
103:19 - that's right ryan is from mobile apps

103:33 - a little bit bigger
103:37 - um
103:38 - oh hold on right here
103:41 - disappear because i already have a menu
103:43 - text right here
103:47 - fonzo sixteen okay
103:49 - next up after that let's go ahead and
103:50 - give a font out of bold
103:54 - oh bold
103:57 - oops bold like this
104:00 - boom see it's a little bit bolder now
104:02 - let's go and give some spacing in
104:03 - between what this and then this whole
104:05 - thing right so i'm going to say here
104:07 - font way ball but also i'm going to say
104:08 - margin left
104:11 - margin left of what or 15 to give us a
104:14 - space in between the actual icon itself
104:18 - and that's pretty pretty pretty much it
104:22 - my friends right so in terms of that
104:24 - that's all we need to do
104:26 - all right so we have margin left 115 and
104:28 - that's it so we have this menu and of
104:30 - course it's not touchable either as well
104:32 - one thing i do want to do however is i
104:34 - want to add a um the style for the
104:37 - right icon i call it for the arrow icon
104:40 - so if i go back to here
104:43 - i'm going to give this a arrow icon
104:44 - style
104:46 - arrow icon because it has a different
104:48 - color if you guys take a look at it here
104:50 - you see there's a different color than
104:52 - the rest of this right here so i'm going
104:53 - to say here arrow icon
104:56 - okay
104:58 - save that i will go to styles here and i
105:00 - will create a new one called aerial icon
105:02 - let's see here
105:05 - arrow
105:06 - icon
105:10 - beautiful and then the color for this
105:12 - one is going to be the following let me
105:14 - see here arrow icon it's going to be
105:16 - this color right here guys
105:18 - [Music]
105:20 - that's it boom so you can see now we
105:22 - have a button everybody now it's a very
105:24 - simple button nothing crazy to make this
105:26 - a full-on button i'm going to do the
105:28 - following i will make this into a
105:30 - touchable opacity so again touchable
105:32 - opacity
105:36 - okay
105:38 - command x
105:40 - tap it out
105:42 - and then what command v
105:46 - save that
105:47 - and stuff like look at that you see it
105:49 - feels like it's an actual button
105:51 - it feels like it's an actual button
105:54 - that's right
105:55 - now of course now
105:56 - if i want to simply replicate this whole
105:58 - thing only to use this i just command c
106:01 - i will do command v another one another
106:03 - one and another one
106:04 - right and i will have a lot of media
106:07 - icons and so forth now for us to make
106:09 - this a little bit even better what i can
106:10 - do for you guys is we can simply just um
106:14 - i want to put a margin bottom on the
106:15 - actual
106:16 - menu row as well so just how we have a
106:18 - menu row margin top we're gonna do menu
106:21 - row margin
106:24 - that's right that's correct we're gonna
106:26 - do 15 yes let's go
106:29 - yeah there we go that's much better guys
106:31 - right so much better
106:35 - yeah yeah yeah yeah and of course also
106:37 - we need to make it into an opera case
106:39 - everything needs to be uppercase so for
106:40 - the menu text right here
106:42 - i expect to go back to here
106:45 - we have a menu text with this media
106:46 - right here
106:48 - let's go back to our styles do we have
106:50 - my new text anywhere we do
106:52 - where is it right here i'm going to give
106:54 - it a text transform
106:56 - of text transform
107:00 - text transform always going to be um
107:04 - uppercase i want to make sure everything
107:05 - is uppercase
107:09 - boom media see so now of course we get
107:12 - all these buttons guys you guys can see
107:14 - that
107:16 - that's right that's right it literally
107:18 - that's right elenor it's literally react
107:20 - is library framework for websites and
107:22 - web apps that's correct that's correct
107:24 - so now we've got all these buttons guys
107:26 - it looks pretty amazing okay but
107:29 - of course i know
107:30 - it's not going to be efficient if i want
107:32 - to can have all these buttons right here
107:34 - you see this i want to have all these
107:36 - buttons
107:38 - so to make this work what we did is we
107:40 - actually created a object file for you
107:44 - so like i said we have a down below in
107:46 - description we have a
107:48 - tesla clone assets folder
107:52 - just simply download right click on this
107:53 - right here click on download that's all
107:55 - you have to do this will have all the
107:57 - assets you need the images and you have
107:59 - something called items.gs and i want you
108:01 - guys to import that alice.js into the
108:03 - menu
108:04 - so if i have here my tesla clone assets
108:07 - right here
108:08 - i'm going to take my my itunes gs and
108:11 - put it into the menu section okay
108:13 - why because here it is
108:15 - so
108:16 - what this does and again this just makes
108:19 - stuff a lot easier for all of us okay
108:21 - we've made this so
108:23 - for example you can see we have items
108:25 - boom right here and every single item is
108:27 - a menu item right here
108:30 - you see so for example let me show you
108:31 - here if we have the media here
108:34 - this is directly correlated to let me
108:37 - show you correlate to the
108:39 - music portion right here
108:42 - boom boom you guys can see that we
108:45 - specify the id we specify the actual
108:47 - icon which we import as well by the way
108:50 - let me specify the actual title two
108:54 - you see that you see that that's right
108:57 - so that is what we do my friends okay
108:59 - so
109:00 - make sure you guys go ahead and download
109:01 - this down below description and make
109:03 - sure you guys hit the like button

109:41 - down below from description just go
109:42 - ahead and and download that little
109:44 - object file and this specifies all of
109:47 - our buttons you can see we have all we
109:49 - have the title that's the actual text
109:51 - we also have the subtitle if you want to
109:53 - use that
109:54 - and so forth now to use this we will go
109:57 - to innis.gs so check this out okay
110:01 - i will go to my index.js here all right
110:04 - and i'm going to import this so i'm
110:06 - going to say import
110:08 - items
110:09 - from not item zoom items
110:12 - from
110:13 - from what from
110:16 - items beautiful okay
110:18 - that's it so i just imported my items
110:20 - now how do i use those well we're gonna
110:22 - usually call them mapping so
110:24 - to map through or to loop through it
110:27 - i just need one so look at this i'm
110:29 - going to say
110:30 - boom boom items tab map
110:33 - okay
110:34 - that map
110:35 - and for the map we get one item for so
110:38 - basically it loops through every single
110:39 - item one by one by one by one by one
110:42 - and for every single one
110:44 - i'm gonna go through it
110:46 - and i'm going to output something with
110:47 - that okay
110:50 - well to output i'm gonna output this one
110:52 - specific button right here
110:54 - boom
110:56 - you can see
110:59 - boom
111:00 - save that okay
111:02 - so that's all i'm gonna do here now of
111:03 - course con each list each child list
111:05 - should have a unique id so that's we're
111:07 - going to add that right now i'm going to
111:08 - need to add a unique id for every single
111:10 - one so i'll say key is equal to
111:13 - right here it's due to item id
111:17 - that's a must for sure and now you have
111:19 - all these buttons which are not scope a
111:21 - scrollable by the way so don't worry
111:22 - we'll fix that in a second here
111:24 - but now let's actually change the text
111:26 - for every single button
111:28 - okay
111:28 - the difference between a map and a flat
111:31 - list so a flat list um is directly comes
111:34 - from react native it does not does not
111:36 - exist in react gs versus a map is just
111:39 - simply just in your normal javascript
111:41 - mapping guys right and that's it so you
111:44 - know that's the biggest difference
111:46 - honestly i would say but you know i
111:48 - think they can they can be used together
111:49 - honestly
111:51 - a flat list yeah so let me take a look
111:53 - at this let me show you here i'm sure i
111:55 - actually want to stick on the topic here
111:56 - so we got this item that id
111:59 - to replace this text right here i'm
112:01 - going to say what i'm going to say item
112:03 - that what who remembers
112:05 - we have the title you see if you go to
112:07 - my answer gs we have item dot title
112:10 - that's right so if i go back to my thing
112:12 - if i save this
112:13 - a
112:14 - you see all of these now have different
112:16 - titles
112:18 - which is exactly what we want
112:21 - not next one we need to now update the
112:24 - actual icon
112:25 - so instead of doing styles that icon
112:27 - sort of do icon is this one i'm going to
112:29 - say here what
112:30 - icon is equal to item dot what icon
112:35 - like this
112:36 - boom
112:38 - and look how fast all of that just
112:40 - happened software climbed everything
112:42 - okay that's right
112:45 - last thing to do is to add a subtitle if
112:48 - you guys look at it right here
112:50 - we have this subtitle
112:53 - okay
112:54 - the subtitle right here
112:57 - two two two two the subtitle right here
112:59 - you guys can see
113:01 - okay
113:03 - and
113:04 - well it's kind of like right
113:07 - there this one this one to add the
113:10 - subtitle i'm gonna say the following now
113:12 - it's not always there because sometimes
113:13 - it doesn't exist but here's well here's
113:16 - what i will do i'm going to check if it
113:17 - exists i'm going to say here if the item
113:20 - that subtitle exists
113:22 - if it does then i will output the
113:25 - following
113:26 - i will output a new text i will say here
113:29 - text
113:31 - text
113:32 - right
113:33 - style is equal to i'm going to say
113:35 - styles
113:36 - dot subtitle
113:39 - right right here close it out
113:42 - and then and then i say item.subtitle so
113:44 - i'm gonna hear
113:46 - item
113:48 - item.subtitle right here beautiful right
113:51 - so we've got those three things okay so
113:54 - basically we're checking here if the
113:55 - subtitle exists then we update then we
113:58 - actually show this if it doesn't exist
114:00 - then we don't worry about showing this
114:02 - and look at this
114:03 - you can see here let me see this does it
114:06 - work
114:08 - if on the subtitle
114:12 - oh yeah it does actually work
114:13 - so now we need to actually create the
114:15 - subtitle uh what's it called the
114:17 - subtitle um
114:20 - css or styling yes you can say
114:23 - let's create our subtitle styling
114:26 - boom boom boom
114:28 - looking back to see and there's a
114:29 - special there's only just a special kind
114:32 - of font size you want to use i'm gonna
114:33 - say here
114:34 - color color is going to be gray color
114:40 - and boom you see it right away shows up
114:42 - right there guys right there gray
114:45 - awesome
114:47 - i'm going to say here font size
114:50 - of what 14.
114:52 - just a little bit like that nice
114:55 - i'm going to say margin left of 15
114:59 - margin left
115:03 - margin uh left
115:05 - 15
115:08 - 15. just sort of together fits with
115:10 - everything else right and my friends
115:12 - that's pretty pretty much it we had
115:14 - these controls but of course you see i
115:16 - can't con scroll anything i can't really
115:18 - do anything with this specific thing
115:21 - and the reason being is because
115:24 - and you know in react native in native
115:27 - applications you need to specify like a
115:29 - scroll direction just go specify scroll
115:31 - view
115:32 - and that's what we need to do right now
115:34 - so let's specify a scroll view so we can
115:36 - actually scroll with this okay
115:39 - okay i will go ahead and open this up
115:43 - i will open this one up
115:45 - okay
115:46 - and
115:47 - and
115:48 - if i show you here what a scroll view is
115:51 - guys
115:52 - scroll view
115:55 - scroll
115:56 - you react native right here i just
115:59 - wanted to show to you here for a second
116:01 - right here
116:05 - see it's just i can scroll through
116:06 - anything pretty much you see i can
116:08 - actually scroll because usually you
116:09 - really can't really scroll usually but
116:12 - if you specify scroll view then yes you
116:14 - can
116:16 - so we need to go back to our in car item
116:18 - and i'm going to import scroll view
116:21 - inside react native
116:26 - let me import scroll view here
116:31 - rule
116:32 - view comma
116:36 - scroll view awesome
116:38 - let's save that one
116:41 - and since i've oh oops oops oops
116:45 - oops oops and where are we going to put
116:47 - the scroll view around is my maybe your
116:49 - question well
116:51 - you put this around the whole menu so i
116:53 - i want to actually put it around this
116:55 - whole thing check this out guys
116:57 - this whole thing because this is what
116:59 - scrolls right
117:01 - this does not scroll and this is this
117:03 - stays put
117:04 - but this however does scroll this has a
117:07 - whole big margin and it that's what we
117:09 - want to allow to scroll
117:11 - so let me see we have the control icons
117:13 - we include that
117:14 - the status we don't include that so i'm
117:16 - going to say here now scroll view
117:20 - scroll view that's where i'll put it
117:21 - here
117:22 - boom boom boom command x that
117:26 - i'll put it around together with the
117:29 - menu
117:30 - boom
117:31 - so now if i go ahead and do this
117:34 - boom
117:35 - scroll view save this let's see
117:39 - oh
117:40 - look at that
117:42 - we have my friends the scroll view so
117:44 - look at this now go back to instags
117:48 - right we don't need any of these other
117:50 - ones we just remove these other ones we
117:52 - don't need any of these we just need the
117:54 - ones that we loop through
117:57 - save this and guys
117:59 - we have ourselves a tesla
118:02 - mobile app fully working for you it's
118:06 - not the tesla app that you'll use on the
118:08 - on your iphone but if you want to
118:10 - compare this let me show you this is the
118:11 - tesla app that i have right here
118:15 - and if you're wondering yes this is i
118:16 - mean you can yeah this is my tesla
118:19 - right here
118:20 - let me show you right here
118:24 - can you guys see it
118:28 - oh come on come on
118:30 - i'll put this used but you guys can see
118:32 - i can scroll through different things
118:34 - right here i can scroll through them
118:36 - right here it says my charging it says
118:38 - my charging it has i can click on a
118:40 - button for example to lock it to unlock
118:43 - it and that's that's pretty much it this
118:45 - is and it's very similar to what we just
118:49 - built
118:50 - right very similar we just built which
118:52 - is again like i said
118:54 - if you look at it we can lock it we can
118:56 - unlock it and go through media you know
118:59 - and a few different other things you can
119:01 - say boom boom boom media cellular
119:03 - updates climate to me this is really
119:05 - interesting honestly to figure out how
119:07 - to build an app in react native
119:09 - personally i have not been the master of
119:11 - react native so for me this was also
119:13 - like a learning opportunity and i'll be
119:14 - honest if you with you if you know
119:16 - react.js you you will learn react native
119:18 - very easily
119:20 - probably like this took me a day to
119:22 - build this on like genuinely and to
119:24 - learn this from scratch
119:26 - um
119:27 - but you know if i did this you could do
119:28 - this too exa you know as well
119:31 - the whole point of this was not just
119:32 - only for you to learn how to build this
119:34 - but also for me to learn how to build
119:36 - this honestly guys and this was a lot of
119:38 - fun for me to build it honestly and i
119:40 - can only see how far we'll get with
119:42 - something like this you know with
119:43 - projects like these you know the next
119:45 - project with my hair is uber eats and
119:47 - and so forth and there's so many other
119:48 - products that we have in store to build
119:50 - you know for you so definitely stay
119:53 - tuned everybody but yeah let me know
119:54 - what you guys think what do you guys

120:37 - on that little barcode see the backup
120:40 - pops up and i can now open my
120:43 - thing right here
120:45 - boom you see so it actually opened the
120:48 - build version let me show you it opened
120:50 - up the build version
120:54 - right here
120:58 - i can click
121:00 - i can click you see so it actually have
121:03 - to build the version of this specific

121:21 - you've actually built this yes this is i
121:23 - know this is only functionality but you
121:24 - know building something like this
121:26 - honestly even for example in swift is
121:28 - hard enough trust me uh even just the
121:30 - view is not easy to be able to loop
121:32 - through something to just show it to you
121:34 - able to have a clickable buttons to have
121:36 - the glue buttons actually react to
121:37 - something and change the state of it for
121:39 - example the lock unlock button it works
121:40 - the way it should be right there's a lot
121:42 - that goes behind it i know in terms of
121:45 - making sure this actually works so
121:47 - i mean the gear icon works the i mean it
121:50 - all works it's called an osmobile
