00:00 - which one should you choose as a
00:01 - developer aws firebase or digitalocean
00:03 - aws is a pretty well known solution but
00:05 - the biggest problem with aws is it's way
00:08 - too complicated as a developer if you've
00:10 - ever tried it you know exactly what i
00:12 - mean i would recommend it for maybe huge
00:14 - businesses but for small developers i
00:16 - would not recommend aws next up we have
00:18 - firebase this is a really good solution
00:20 - there's easy setup it's easy to
00:22 - implement and you have a real-time
00:24 - database however the biggest problem is
00:26 - you're logged into firebase's ecosystem
00:28 - which means that if you want to use sql
00:30 - or sqlite or really any other type of
00:33 - database you can't really use that here
00:34 - your vendor locked in now the last
00:36 - option we have is digitalocean it's fast
00:38 - it's incredibly easy to use and best of
00:41 - all you're not logged into anything and
00:43 - in fact you actually get to whip up your
00:45 - own cloud server online in a very short
00:48 - amount of time and you have your own app
00:50 - up and running and then it's also very
00:52 - powerful and scalable like aws with a
00:55 - lot less hassle it's cheaper and it's
00:57 - much much faster so i'd recommend you go
