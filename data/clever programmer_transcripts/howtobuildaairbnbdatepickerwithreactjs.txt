00:00 - yeah oh nice that looks clean like a
00:02 - crisp little look to that
00:04 - uh and what we're gonna do now is
00:06 - actually go ahead and have so we've done
00:08 - that sort of
00:09 - very nice sort of look and feel to that
00:11 - part what we're gonna do is have an
00:13 - actual search button at the top so a
00:14 - search bomb which has search
00:16 - dates right so at this point to add that
00:19 - search button i'm going to go ahead
00:21 - add a another div on on top of this
00:25 - and this one we're going to call someone
00:28 - say div
00:28 - like here i'm going to give it a class
00:30 - name so i'm going to say class name
00:33 - last name of banner and this is going to
00:36 - be banner underscore underscore search
00:38 - like this and here i'm going to
00:40 - basically add in a
00:42 - button so i'm going to say a button will
00:44 - exist here
00:45 - and this button will essentially say at
00:47 - this point we're going to say just
00:48 - search
00:48 - dates right so something like this
00:50 - button search dates
00:52 - and what i want to do is i'm going to
00:53 - give it a variant of outline so i'm
00:55 - going to go ahead and do this
00:57 - oops i've forgot that we don't have
00:59 - previous i'm going to go ahead and do
01:00 - variant
01:01 - of outlined oops variant of outline like
01:06 - this
01:06 - awesome and then what i'm going to do is
01:09 - give it a class name as well so i'm
01:11 - going to go ahead and say class name
01:14 - of banner underscore underscore search
01:17 - button
01:17 - so we can start this later on so banner
01:19 - search button and with that said it
01:21 - should we should have a button on top
01:23 - and you can see it's actually
01:25 - there it's a little bit difficult to see
01:26 - but it's actually sitting there at the
01:27 - top and it says search dates at the top
01:29 - so that's very clean now we're going to
01:31 - go ahead and style that so
01:33 - whenever we give a material ui class
01:37 - a class we actually need to style it
01:38 - with the important properties so i'm
01:40 - going to go ahead
01:41 - and add the following styles to that
01:43 - button i'm going to say a background
01:44 - color of white
01:45 - i'm going to say the font weight should
01:47 - be 900 and it should have a text
01:49 - transform
01:50 - so to get rid of the uppercase text and
01:52 - we're going to give it the text itself a
01:54 - color of
01:55 - the airbnb pink so that's how we get
01:57 - that look and feel
01:59 - and then what i'm going to say is for
02:02 - the banner search so the actual div
02:04 - surrounding it i'm going to say go ahead
02:07 - and do the following so i'm going to say
02:08 - give it a top of zero so it should be
02:10 - attached to the top give it a display
02:12 - flex so actually let's go ahead and get
02:13 - rid of this one
02:14 - we can do display flex and then we're
02:17 - going to say flex direction
02:19 - column and this will actually span the
02:20 - entire width
02:22 - of the screen so display column and now
02:25 - you should see it takes up the top of
02:26 - the column so you see at the top now we
02:27 - have that search dates
02:29 - and i'm going to get rid of the home
02:30 - component text over there because that's
02:32 - just ugly right now
02:34 - so boom there we go you've got the
02:36 - search dates at the top
02:37 - right so that looks clean um but what we
02:40 - want to do now
02:41 - is have it so that when you click search
02:43 - dates we essentially change it so it
02:45 - says search dates and then hide
02:47 - search dates and hide and have to to
02:49 - demonstrate this go to the deployed
02:51 - version quasi
02:56 - yeah let's go and if you click on search
02:57 - dates
02:59 - so you see it says hide at the top and
03:01 - then it says search dates
03:02 - every time you click the button it
03:04 - changes the state right
03:06 - right so we want to get that
03:07 - functionality and then basically we
03:09 - and that nice little like nice little
03:12 - animation when i click it at the top
03:14 - yeah so that's actually already in there
03:17 - at the moment so if you go ahead and go
03:18 - to r1
03:19 - so that's the reason why we get that is
03:23 - because we're using the material ui
03:25 - button
03:26 - nice okay yeah so that's why we
03:29 - get that one right there so awesome so
03:33 - now what we're going to do is we are
03:35 - going to go to
03:37 - the um search dates and what we've got
03:41 - to do to
03:42 - get this functionality is actually add
03:43 - in a piece of state so the piece of
03:45 - state that we're going to add in so
03:46 - state is essentially just how you write
03:48 - a variable inside of react
03:50 - here we're going to have a piece of
03:51 - state which is called show search
03:54 - right and the reason why we're going to
03:55 - do this is because we want this but we
03:57 - want this variable
03:59 - to keep track of if we click that button
04:01 - or not and by default initially when we
04:03 - click it
04:03 - we're going to have false and the reason
04:05 - why we want to do this is because we're
04:07 - going to say
04:07 - if you click it so let's just say for
04:09 - example um
04:11 - whenever it says show search so if so
04:14 - show search is true
04:15 - then i basically want to render out the
04:17 - search element that you guys saw earlier
04:19 - so
04:19 - let's just say show such uh show date
04:23 - picker let's show
04:24 - show date because that's what we're
04:25 - trying to do here um
04:27 - exactly now if we go ahead and say it
04:30 - says use state is not defined we need to
04:32 - import that
04:33 - so we need to import that as such at the
04:35 - top of the file
04:36 - there we go save it and then we should
04:38 - be able to see
04:40 - now if we save that so kazi now if we
04:44 - actually change this to true you should
04:47 - be able to see
04:48 - that it should say show date picker
04:50 - awesome and if i change this to false
04:52 - it goes ahead and it hides that right so
04:56 - now we have some kind of
04:57 - functionality to it right so what we
04:59 - need to do is that button
05:01 - we're going to tie the functionality to
05:02 - that button so i'm going to say on click
05:04 - of that button whenever you click that
05:06 - button
05:06 - i'm going to shoot off an arrow function
05:08 - so it's going to shoot off a
05:10 - function and this is going to say set
05:13 - show search to whatever
05:16 - the opposite of show search currently is
05:18 - so if it's currently true
05:20 - it's going to become false if it's
05:21 - currently false it's going to become
05:22 - true
05:23 - so now to show this in practice kazi go
05:25 - ahead and hit the search date button
05:27 - or search yeah search dates
05:31 - and now you can see show date picker
05:32 - there we go so you see we have some kind
05:34 - of functionality to it now
05:36 - right and now that is gonna that
05:39 - basically sets us up for the next part
05:41 - this
05:41 - the next part is essentially building
05:43 - that beautiful date picker that you guys
05:45 - see
05:45 - in the final build which is a really
05:47 - nice all right i'll add that i'll add
05:49 - that to the top so currently we're
05:51 - working on building the date picker
05:53 - yep we're building the date picker at
05:55 - the moment
05:59 - okay i just added that to the top
06:03 - awesome so now what we're going to do
06:06 - is let's go ahead and go to
06:10 - um let's go ahead and actually go to we
06:14 - need to basically we're going to replace
06:15 - this show date picker
06:17 - with some kind of component which looks
06:19 - like this so we're going to have a
06:20 - search
06:21 - component right and this search
06:23 - component should render out to be
06:25 - essentially what we see in the final
06:26 - product so let's go ahead and create
06:28 - search.js so we should snap into that
06:30 - file
06:31 - any second now i've just created a
06:33 - search.js file
06:35 - and boom we are in it and if we do rfc
06:39 - a we should get our es7 snippet and
06:42 - let's go ahead and do our normal
06:43 - bem naming convention so we say search
06:46 - let's go ahead and create the
06:47 - appropriate
06:48 - css file so we're going to import from
06:50 - search.css
06:51 - save that create the search.css file
06:55 - nice um by the way we just broke
06:58 - 1 000 likes
07:02 - yeah thank you guys so much for that
07:05 - that is
07:06 - huge and meriban says that
07:09 - if sunny could he would shower with the
07:12 - airpods
07:13 - [Laughter]
07:19 - chris thanks so much for the five dollar
07:22 - donation
07:22 - really really appreciate you damn and he
07:25 - goes finishing up the hulu
07:27 - shadow clone you did yesterday but
07:29 - wanted to show some love
07:31 - hey that's awesome dude glad you're
07:33 - doing that
07:34 - because yeah the hulu clone was the
07:36 - hooligan was one of the funnest builds i
07:38 - didn't think it would be that fun but
07:39 - it was free if you guys haven't yeah if
07:42 - you guys haven't that's something which
07:43 - like
07:44 - just looks so nice on your portfolio
07:46 - like the hulu clone
07:47 - um it might already be deployed actually
07:49 - so you might have it
07:50 - um is it clone
07:54 - let me go ahead and see if i've got it
07:55 - so i've got the actual link here i can
07:57 - drop it tunes
07:58 - let's go ahead and do it i'll drop it in
08:00 - the code quasi so
08:01 - go ahead and check out that okay boom
08:05 - all right got it
08:09 - so this is the one you guys built
08:11 - yesterday damn it just looks
08:13 - so freaking slick like look at that
08:17 - wow insane yeah and it's completely uh
08:19 - connected to an api
08:21 - so if you go to the top and you actually
08:23 - go ahead and click because i was
08:24 - wondering i'm like how much
08:26 - accurate dummy text and data did you
08:29 - guys
08:29 - add like holy crap oh wow so if i
08:33 - actually change
08:34 - horror romance it changes yo this build
08:37 - is actually
08:38 - sick kind of regret that i wasn't like
08:40 - here for this build
08:43 - this one was pretty fun yeah like look
08:45 - at how juicy it all looks like
08:48 - even before the even the animations like
08:51 - me and frankie were saying adding those
08:52 - animations changes
08:54 - it from a website to an app yeah yeah
08:57 - true true true yeah
09:00 - that's true so this is the kind this is
09:02 - the kind of app that you guys would see
09:03 - on like a fire stick
09:04 - tv app or something you know like this
09:07 - is the kind of thing that you would be
09:08 - used to seeing
09:09 - as opposed to just a website like you so
09:12 - you could probably build this deploy
09:13 - on some kind of fire stick app and yeah
09:15 - that'd be awesome
09:19 - nice somebody asked luke says why don't
09:21 - you guys work at google
09:23 - guys we're not the guys who work at
09:24 - google we get the guys who work at
09:27 - google
09:28 - at google we're those guys
09:33 - literally those guys yeah
09:37 - yeah hopefully in the next one or two
09:39 - years like
09:41 - the probability of somebody asking like
09:43 - how'd you get a job at google
09:45 - like and somebody like saying clever
09:47 - programmer would be like
09:48 - massive like hey it was clever
09:51 - programmer
09:53 - exactly nice so with that said let's go
09:57 - ahead and build the search functionality
09:59 - so
10:00 - let's go back to search and here this is
10:02 - where
10:03 - this is going to be an intricate part of
10:04 - it hold on so are we building search or
10:06 - date picker
10:08 - yeah uh so we're building the date
10:10 - picker but this is
10:11 - it's part basically the date picker is
10:13 - the search component
10:15 - [Music]
10:16 - um
10:19 - [Laughter]
10:26 - okay all right i mean i i don't underst
10:28 - how does that work
10:30 - there this is the date picker component
10:33 - yeah
10:34 - right so are we working are we not
10:36 - working on the data picker component
10:38 - then okay okay all right i'll just let
10:39 - you keep going yeah
10:40 - oh yeah we are yeah the search component
10:42 - i'm gonna add this in here
10:44 - date picker component there we go
10:47 - all right nice so
10:51 - um now we've got the i think maybe loves
10:54 - your chair
10:57 - this is this new chair by the way i

11:07 - pillow here for me to sleep on look at
11:10 - that
11:11 - you know there's a proper stream
11:12 - streaming yeah yeah yeah and then it has
11:15 - like this
11:16 - back support thing which is hard to show
11:18 - right now but
11:19 - it's right here this thing right there
11:22 - nice so it has yeah
11:25 - because what was happening with other
11:27 - chair was i couldn't like
11:29 - i couldn't actually sit with my back on

12:24 - [Laughter]
12:28 - all right here we go
12:32 - back back to the date picker nice
12:36 - so inside the date picker we need to do
12:39 - a few things right so the thing that
12:41 - actually allows all that date picker
12:43 - magic to happen
12:44 - is um the react date range
12:48 - so i'm trying to kill the laughter
12:55 - let's open up the terminal quasi
13:00 - whoops raffle there we go raphael says
13:03 - honey is that your amg
13:04 - that is my amg thank you dude hey that

13:28 - um okay so second terminal right here
13:32 - type in here npmi icu yep npm i and then
13:36 - react date range
13:37 - so this one right here and it doesn't
13:38 - matter if you're in that folder or in
13:40 - the actual
13:40 - app folder right yeah it doesn't matter
13:43 - which one
13:44 - well cd anyways bro cause we're gonna
13:46 - forget when we're about to deploy
13:48 - oh damn wait no hold up did i do it okay
13:51 - good shot dude good job yeah make sure
13:53 - you're in the right one because
13:54 - otherwise

14:04 - [Music]
14:06 - make sure you're in the right photo guys
14:08 - because that will i don't know my
14:09 - terminals being so slow

15:02 - let's do it dude
15:03 - i'm down i want to learn jiu-jitsu as
15:05 - well i'll be sick
15:06 - yeah so now guys we're going to import
15:10 - the date range picker so this is like a
15:12 - very handy
15:13 - npm module that i found
15:17 - and we've got we're going to import and
15:19 - now you also need to import two other
15:21 - files
15:21 - so these are css files that the guys who
15:24 - made this
15:25 - module recommend that you you bring in
15:27 - and this is because basically this is
15:30 - going to give you all that styling that
15:31 - you guys saw in the final one
15:33 - that's how the date picker looks the way
15:35 - it looks uh
15:36 - [Laughter]
15:38 - sharia sharma
15:43 - mma tutorials coming soon yeah
15:47 - just to see us doing react one day jiu
15:50 - jitsu the next
15:51 - unboxing the the day after that that's
15:55 - it nice so we've we imported the date
15:58 - range picker and to use it
16:00 - there's a few things we need to do now
16:02 - right so we need to add two pieces of
16:04 - state
16:04 - and to add those pieces of state it's
16:06 - very simple one is
16:08 - going to be for the start date and one
16:11 - is going to be for the end date
16:12 - so here we just done that so we've added
16:14 - in the start date and date
16:15 - let's go ahead and do yep that's it nice
16:17 - and for the start date we're going to
16:19 - give it a
16:19 - we're just using today's date as the
16:21 - initial value and for the end date we're
16:22 - doing today's date as well
16:24 - now once we've done that we need to
16:26 - actually add in the following
16:27 - object so here we basically say cons
16:30 - selection range
16:31 - now this stuff you don't really need to
16:32 - know why we need to read it this way the
16:34 - main thing is is
16:36 - [Laughter]
16:39 - somebody said sonny can't stop laughing
16:40 - at frankie's chair
16:43 - it does make me laugh yeah frankie
16:46 - frankie show us your chair again
16:50 - oh [ __ ] it's because oh [ __ ]
16:53 - what happened here yo who's manning the
16:56 - [ __ ] live chat
16:59 - damn guys it's because
17:03 - you're like this you're like super stern
17:05 - on your jet you know
17:08 - bro i'm not leaving this thing bro i'm
17:10 - just glued to this thing
17:12 - because i've learned my lesson my neck
17:14 - starts breaking after doing the live
17:15 - streams
17:16 - yeah it does it does
17:22 - we need to add this selection range and
17:24 - this is something that they want you to
17:26 - do if you're using this so you need to
17:27 - do section range start date end date and
17:29 - then the key
17:30 - which is just selection i'm not sure
17:31 - what the key is for in this
17:33 - situation but you need to have it so add
17:36 - that in and then we're going to create a
17:37 - function
17:38 - and this function is basically
17:40 - responsible for
17:42 - this function is responsible for when
17:44 - you basically select
17:46 - a date so here we're saying whenever you
17:47 - select a date set the start date to
17:50 - whatever range
17:50 - you selected the start date and then set
17:53 - the end date to whatever range you
17:54 - selected the end date
17:55 - now this is all done by the library
17:58 - itself so we just need to have this
18:00 - function in here
18:01 - and then they handle everything else um
18:05 - so manava ross says are you going to
18:07 - launch any react native course and he
18:08 - just dropped a
18:09 - donation thank you for that thank you um
18:12 - yeah not a react native course at this
18:14 - point but react we're covering so
18:16 - uh yeah so we'll actually be dropping
18:18 - some content on react native very soon
18:20 - nice so we have the search here and now
18:22 - what we're gonna do
18:24 - is we are actually gonna go ahead and
18:27 - add in
18:31 - the following line of code now this is
18:32 - the date range picker itself so
18:34 - date range picker ranges we basically
18:37 - pass an array
18:38 - with selection range so this one here
18:41 - and that's
18:42 - an object and then on change we pass in
18:45 - our handle select function
18:46 - okay so this is stuff that i would
18:48 - recommend you guys just follow
18:49 - you literally just follow it along you
18:51 - do it as i've written it and everything
18:53 - will just work for you as well
18:54 - inside your project so cozy let's go
18:56 - ahead and open up our localhost
19:00 - and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
19:01 - import the search so import
19:04 - import search from
19:08 - search yeah there we go
19:13 - and now what we should be able to see is
19:15 - it says use state is undefined okay so
19:17 - you state is not fine we need to go
19:18 - ahead and do this
19:19 - nice save it and now it also says i
19:23 - can't read that it says
19:24 - cannot resolve something what does that
19:27 - say cannot resolve
19:29 - um let me go ahead and pop this in
19:31 - because oh yeah i've got it
19:33 - localhost 3000. nice
19:38 - but but it says cannot resolve date fns
19:41 - oh yes
19:42 - okay so this actually requires something
19:44 - called fns so you need to do mpmi so
19:46 - let's go ahead and pull it up npm i
19:48 - date fns so it's a peer dependency
19:51 - to be honest they should have set the
19:54 - the modules up to actually do this for
19:56 - you
19:56 - but you need to do this step guys
19:58 - because you need that
19:59 - um otherwise you're going to run into
20:01 - this issue
20:03 - so that's they're bad but it should be
20:05 - fine
20:06 - so now once that installs that should
20:08 - fix this
20:09 - issue for us um
20:12 - okay there we go so now if we actually
20:15 - see it should be loading up for us
20:18 - in a second so nice so now if we click
20:21 - search dates awesome because you go
20:23 - ahead and click search days
20:32 - hey
20:34 - it's opening that thing up bro let me
20:37 - refresh
20:38 - and let's click it again boom look at
20:41 - that
20:42 - got yesterday this week damn bro that
20:45 - they built all of that out of the box i
20:47 - was like
20:48 - i don't know why but i was thinking man
20:49 - i'm like sonny must have done a lot of
20:51 - math here
20:52 - to make this stuff work like damn bro
20:56 - i should have just made up some some
20:59 - excuse me like yeah dude
21:00 - you know what to be honest i have built
21:02 - one of these manually at a previous job
21:04 - and guys it's actually a headache to
21:06 - build that so
21:07 - using a package like this is actually
21:09 - really really handy
21:11 - and this one is actually looks beautiful
21:13 - it looks it looks really nice it's a
21:16 - really really good library to use
21:17 - because there's a lot of edge cases that
21:18 - you have to account for when you're
21:19 - doing this
21:20 - guys stop repeating questions in the
21:22 - chat
21:24 - we are gonna block you
21:28 - so now what we're going to do is let's
21:30 - go ahead and
21:31 - add in um let's go ahead and add in the
21:35 - following so
21:37 - i need to actually i want to check
21:38 - something actually i wonder if we
21:40 - removed this from underneath
21:44 - here and changed it over here and then
21:46 - we tried it so let's go ahead and
21:48 - save i just want to try something
21:50 - quickly
21:51 - so now if we go ahead and try and click
21:54 - the search dates
21:56 - okay that's pretty clean but it's not as
21:58 - nice as we want all right
22:00 - anyway so going back to the point so
22:01 - let's go ahead and we've added in this
22:03 - the
22:03 - this date picker functionality so we
22:05 - need to style it to look the way that we
22:07 - want it to look
22:08 - right um so in order to get it to look
22:12 - like that
22:12 - we need to do a bunch of styling to this
22:14 - thing um and in order to do that let's
22:16 - go ahead
22:17 - and do the following so inside of search
22:19 - this target search
22:21 - let's do the following so we're going to
22:22 - say position absolute uh top 35 pixels
22:25 - left 25
22:27 - width of 100 view it so um because if
22:30 - you go ahead and click
22:31 - on the search dates yo thanks adam
22:36 - whoa what happened to my voice there yo
22:39 - thanks adam
22:40 - for the 79 cent

23:23 - thank you dude so here we're going to do
23:25 - so click on search dates
23:27 - all right boom clicked yeah
23:30 - and now as we style it you'll be able to
23:32 - see everything sort of move around as we
23:34 - need it so click leave that open
23:36 - uh what we're going to do you want me to
23:37 - make it half the screen
23:39 - yeah that's too hard enough nice so now
23:42 - what i'm going to do
23:43 - is i'm going to add in boom i'm going to
23:46 - add in this
23:47 - and we're going to make it so now it's
23:49 - saying top 35
23:50 - pixels from the top left 25 pixels and
23:54 - then
23:54 - width 100 view it let's do half enough
23:56 - quasi
23:58 - for this fit all right i will
24:03 - somebody is like yo if you guys are
24:05 - making so much money why
24:06 - do these little donations impress you
24:09 - guys
24:09 - that's the humility that actually got us
24:11 - here today
24:13 - exactly yeah and that would never change
24:16 - guys like even if somebody sent us one
24:18 - like literally no like thumbs up button
24:21 - yeah hitting the thumbs up button we're
24:22 - so grateful for like
24:24 - it literally doesn't like i remember in
24:26 - the beginning we started off and it was
24:27 - like a four dollar donation and it was
24:28 - like
24:29 - it blew our mind so yeah yeah
24:32 - dude is that what mike pence's is a one
24:37 - yeah one uh pound one one cent
24:40 - one pounds i'm not just a bad joke but
24:44 - okay got it
24:46 - nice so now i was talking about this guy
24:50 - like mike pence but i'll just remove it
24:58 - so now we're going to do the we're going
25:00 - to target the h2
25:02 - uh which is so right now we don't
25:04 - actually have a h2 element so i'm going
25:05 - to go back to our search
25:07 - i'm going to add in a h2 which is
25:08 - basically going to be the number of
25:10 - guests so we're going to have that
25:11 - number of guests pop in underneath and
25:13 - then we're going to have number of
25:15 - guests
25:15 - and also we're going to have an input
25:18 - field
25:19 - for the number of guests so here we're
25:21 - going to have an input field
25:22 - for like how many guests you want to
25:24 - have and they're also going to have a
25:25 - button which says
25:26 - search airbnb right so i'm going to add
25:29 - a button
25:30 - so here i'm going to say
25:33 - i'm going to say button and i need to do
25:35 - an import for that
25:36 - and here i'm going to say search airbnb
25:38 - so let's go ahead and do that search
25:40 - airbnb
25:42 - let's go ahead and import that at the
25:43 - top so boom
25:46 - like that save the file and it says
25:49 - people icon is not defined because
25:51 - the people icon is an icon that we need
25:53 - to
25:55 - import from material ui so
25:58 - go ahead and save that hey adam tate
26:01 - just dropped another donation of two
26:03 - pounds he says thanks for taking your
26:04 - evenings up to do this
26:06 - dude you're welcome like it's insane the
26:07 - amount of value that we see you guys
26:09 - like you know
26:13 - thank you bro this guy's working his way
26:15 - up from pants to
26:16 - multiple pens thank you really
26:20 - appreciate it
26:21 - i think the first one was just a feeler
26:23 - you know
26:24 - yeah damn
26:29 - all right thank you bro nice so now
26:33 - what we're going to do is we have the
26:35 - dates popping up
26:37 - um so again if you could just click on
26:40 - the search dates button cozy
26:44 - reason why we have to click it is
26:45 - because yeah it refreshes at times so
26:47 - now you can see it says
26:49 - search at the moment oh salman fazad
26:52 - uh for faizal has dropped five canadian
26:55 - dollars nice
26:56 - so we'll be coming back to this later at
26:58 - my own pace just passing by to say thank
27:00 - you
27:01 - hold on let me pop that in let me pop
27:02 - that in okay now cover it
27:05 - so he says we'll be coming back to code
27:06 - this later on at my own pace
27:08 - just passing by to say thank you from
27:10 - everyone by the way we will be coding
27:12 - react native anytime soon
27:15 - of course dude we will be definitely
27:16 - calling native soon so stay tuned for
27:18 - that and again massive thank you for
27:20 - donating that's it
27:20 - we really appreciate that thank you bro
27:24 - awesome so let's go ahead
27:28 - and do um
27:32 - the h2 yeah so now for the h2 what i'm
27:35 - going to do is i'm going to do this
27:36 - i'm going to copy a bunch of styles in
27:38 - here and i'm going to explain through
27:39 - what they're doing so
27:40 - as soon as i hit save on this you
27:42 - actually see the style looked a bit
27:44 - different there right and the reason why
27:45 - that happened is because i don't display
27:47 - flex align
27:48 - item center which means that the um
27:51 - we now have that icon so that people
27:54 - icon
27:54 - push to the right so um we now have the
27:58 - people so
27:59 - uh cause you might need to move our face
28:01 - on the
28:02 - uh on ecam so let's move our face to
28:05 - maybe the center
28:07 - you got it because right now it's
28:09 - covering the number of guests
28:11 - um so so that should be you should go
28:14 - you guys should be obscene now on the
28:16 - drop down it says
28:17 - the number of guests and then it
28:19 - actually has that people icon and then
28:21 - we got that
28:22 - with justify content space between and
28:23 - display flex so now they're spaced apart
28:26 - and we gave it a width of five five nine
28:27 - padding of 10 pixels background color of
28:29 - white
28:30 - position absolute left of zero and top
28:32 - of 380 pixels and
28:34 - the parent we actually gave it a
28:36 - position relative so that's why
28:38 - it stays in its place so the next thing
28:41 - is i'm just going to go ahead and style
28:43 - the input so the input field
28:45 - is this one here so this one over here
28:48 - and
28:48 - this one i'm going to go ahead and do
28:50 - this so i'm going to say a width of 539
28:52 - padding at 20 pixels position absolute
28:55 - left 0 height 30 pixels
28:57 - top 420 and border of none so you guys
29:00 - can just go ahead and actually just use
29:01 - these styles and copy us
29:03 - and it will work for you um and that
29:06 - actually drops it down to the next line
29:07 - and that's actually a very nice
29:10 - um uh number sort of that you can now
29:13 - select and it will show you
29:15 - uh and the final thing that we're going
29:16 - to do or not the final thing but i
29:18 - basically now when you click the number
29:19 - of guests because you click on the the
29:21 - number two
29:22 - and you'll see that you'll see that
29:24 - nasty outline
29:25 - so uh not not that one it's just number
29:27 - of guests
29:29 - yeah so you get that nasty outline so to
29:32 - get rid of that we add in this we say
29:33 - when we focus
29:34 - make the outline with zero so you can
29:37 - see it's gone now
29:38 - oh that is but now i can't hold on
29:42 - yeah it's definitely gone yeah it's true
29:45 - it's gone but
29:46 - the date picker kind of blends into the
29:48 - page a little bit so i can't see where
29:50 - it's ending but yeah definitely it looks
29:51 - much better
29:53 - yeah so right now that's fine because we
29:56 - will be adding a button which you'll be
29:58 - able to see in a sec
29:59 - yeah so for the button to style we need
30:02 - to do the following we're going to say
30:03 - go ahead and target that button
30:05 - and do the following so position
30:08 - absolute left of zero
30:10 - but top four text transform inherit and
30:12 - that's because we don't want to be
30:13 - uppercase
30:15 - background color of the airbnb color and
30:17 - then color white and the width of 57579
30:20 - and that will give you the exact perfect
30:21 - dimensions that you guys are going to
30:22 - need
30:23 - and it should do what we want
30:26 - so there you go you've got it looking
30:28 - pretty good but when you hover over so
30:30 - because if you hover over search airbnb
30:32 - right now you'll see it kind of goes
30:34 - transparent which is nasty
30:36 - like so the the search airbnb yeah we
30:38 - see that kind of
30:40 - we don't want that we want it to
30:42 - basically invert the colors
30:44 - right so to do so to do that we add this
30:46 - in we say
30:47 - when we hover whenever we hover over it
30:51 - we want to basically do a background
30:52 - color of white and a
30:54 - color text to be that so now
30:57 - if you do it and you hover over that you
31:00 - actually see it
31:02 - so if you click uh hover over search
31:04 - airbnb
31:05 - click it nice not looks clean you want
31:08 - me to click it
31:09 - uh not yet not yet got it got it because
31:12 - i i
31:12 - will click it danny finkelstein says

31:19 - snap let me find out damn
31:23 - thank you bro for that five dollar
31:25 - donation
31:26 - and said whoa okay nice danny
31:30 - thoroughly tonight hey
31:33 - let's go
31:36 - [Music]
31:38 - emotional code coming in with the heavy
31:41 - hidden 20
31:42 - donation thank you so much and all he
31:45 - said was
31:48 - that was his message to us thank you
31:50 - whenever i see like a 20
31:52 - donation or something i just picture
31:54 - somebody coming in swinging
31:56 - everything's frank seriously yeah
31:59 - this is just epic thank you for that we
32:02 - are at 111 dollars in super chat thank
32:05 - you so much
32:06 - we just broke a hundred dollars and uh
32:08 - you guys are awesome
32:11 - that's insane thank you so much guys
32:13 - let's keep this going
32:17 - so now what we're going to do is we are
32:19 - going to have it so now we actually have
32:21 - that date picker component looking
32:23 - beautiful it looks really nice
32:24 - but when we click search dates we want
32:26 - to change the text
32:28 - and we want to change that text so that
32:29 - it actually says hide
32:31 - right so how do we do that we go back to
32:33 - banner and here
32:35 - where we had the search dates what we
32:37 - can do here is we can actually go ahead
32:39 - and change this now
32:41 - so that it says the following we can
32:42 - actually say
32:44 - we can do this we can get rid of this
32:48 - right and inside of here what we can do
32:50 - is we can say if
32:51 - show search is true then show hold up
32:54 - text
32:55 - one second so sunny
32:58 - yeah hold up hold up hold up hold up
33:02 - how do we is there a way we can hide the
33:05 - side bar completely which one
33:08 - the status i think it's the is it the
33:11 - activity bar or the status bar
33:13 - oh you're talking about that blue stuff
33:15 - at the bottom
33:16 - on the left hand side i think that's the
33:18 - status the on the left hand side the one
33:21 - that with the file and the icons because
33:23 - the code is getting
33:24 - way too rap like it's getting wrapped up
33:27 - way too much
33:29 - um what we can do you know what i mean
33:31 - like it's looking too
33:33 - goofy now yeah i think we can do
33:36 - like what is this show sidebar
33:40 - i mean i can make it smaller but i think
33:42 - then it becomes really hard to read
33:44 - unless everybody's okay with reading
33:46 - that
33:47 - i think that's okay i think that's okay
33:50 - yeah i think that will be pretty good
33:52 - okay if you guys are okay with that
33:54 - tax just let me know otherwise i can
33:55 - change it back
33:57 - yeah and thank you so much devon
34:01 - for the five euro
34:04 - donation thank you so much brother i
34:06 - really appreciate it
34:08 - awesome that's nice thank you dude
34:11 - so now what we're going to do is we have
34:14 - the search dates
34:15 - uh added on and if you click on uh the
34:18 - search dates cause you saw in localhost
34:19 - 3000
34:21 - you'll notice it says hide so it's a
34:24 - search date and then it says hi
34:26 - yeah that's awesome so we have this whoa
34:30 - yeah okay if you make it bigger there
34:32 - you go it centers perfectly so you get a
34:34 - nice like
34:35 - little look to it awesome
34:39 - so now what we're going to do is we're
34:41 - going to make it
