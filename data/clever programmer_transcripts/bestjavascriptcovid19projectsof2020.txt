10:11 - think yeah that is awesome
10:13 - nice he's got the nice flags each
10:16 - country's flags
10:18 - and they told cases looks really good
10:20 - too that's pretty cool
10:22 - what happens if you click through so
10:23 - click the recover and desk click through
10:24 - that
10:25 - uh recovered okay let's click
10:28 - that oh nice it actually changes on the
10:32 - map
10:32 - so it doesn't change the total i mean
10:34 - this is here just
10:35 - total cl uh cases globally uh
10:39 - but it does seem like it changes let me
10:41 - see if maybe i can put our
10:42 - ourselves at the top right that might be
10:45 - better for everybody
10:47 - um but yeah it looks like the whole map
10:50 - changes which is really cool
10:52 - nice i like that that's cool yeah but
10:55 - the charge.js thing that that graph
10:57 - doesn't
10:58 - just doesn't change which is okay and
10:59 - then he's got news at the bottom too so
11:01 - if people
11:02 - are trying to read news guys on a scale
11:04 - of 1 to 10
11:05 - what would you guys rate this go ahead
11:08 - and drop that in the comments below what
11:09 - would you guys rate this
11:11 - app and i think you know i mean i like
11:14 - it
11:14 - nas i think let's now take a look at
11:16 - maybe other projects as well i think
11:18 - this is pretty good
11:18 - let's do it yeah yeah already rated guys
11:21 - 10 being the best and then one being
11:23 - like not so good
11:24 - all right that's the skill guys yeah i
11:26 - kind of also want to take a look at how
11:28 - creative they got with it to be honest
11:30 - so
11:31 - like bro just to wait till you get
11:32 - because i think like
11:35 - wow so this is one done by rania
11:38 - okay this is really cool i really like
11:40 - this one i love how
11:43 - pretty much everything is there right in
11:45 - like one glance
11:46 - i really like that like even active
11:48 - recovered and debts
11:50 - now let's see if i actually change the
11:52 - country what happens
11:53 - albania wow a lot of stuff changes
11:56 - including total
11:58 - no total cases but this over here
12:00 - changes
12:01 - and then it actually takes me closer to
12:04 - maybe where albania
12:06 - is so i'm very very bad at geography so
12:09 - i'm not exactly clear
12:10 - i suck at geography man yeah i'm really
12:13 - bad at that stuff
12:14 - can i click on countries okay i can't
12:16 - click on countries
12:19 - looks like people are given an eight and
12:21 - nine i see a seven
12:23 - i see a ten nice i see a ten thousand
12:26 - okay
12:26 - somebody lost their minds i see nine
12:28 - point five eight
12:30 - okay cool okay yeah so now let's go
12:33 - ahead
12:34 - what are your thoughts on this so like
12:36 - my thoughts are really good it's clean i
12:38 - love how you used all the real estate
12:39 - what i do think could have been better
12:41 - rania is like for example that table
12:43 - right there
12:44 - if you could have expand that table to
12:45 - be your full 100 width because you know
12:47 - how it kind of it doesn't cover the 400
12:49 - with the left table
12:50 - that could have been made better right
12:52 - so so like maybe
12:54 - got it so there is like space here
12:56 - that's like not really being used for
12:57 - anything
12:58 - and it's just like you know what's
12:59 - what's really going on here you know and
13:01 - i think
13:02 - guys one other big thing is like when
13:04 - we're developing these applications it's
13:05 - really
13:06 - really important is it's okay to limit
13:09 - the width of an
13:10 - app you can literally say hey the max
13:12 - width of my app is going to be you know
13:14 - 700 pixels right or 800 pixels or a
13:17 - thousand pixels right
13:18 - that way when you look at it on a large
13:21 - screen it doesn't get blown out
13:22 - right yeah that's what we did that's
13:24 - what we did with that project the one i
13:25 - just showed you the one
13:26 - we started off with profit with
13:27 - javascript oh hold on hold on so
13:29 - actually nas to be fair it's actually
13:32 - supposed to look more like
13:34 - this okay that's better so what actually
13:38 - happened
13:38 - was that because again i'm on a 5k
13:42 - imac that like nobody really develops
13:44 - anything for
13:45 - so on that it looks a little but it
13:47 - looks like it does
13:48 - take up so it's it's pretty good
13:50 - actually in that sense
13:52 - gotcha bother that dang dang man what
13:55 - did these students are freaking killing
13:57 - it and like look even even mobile even
13:59 - it's like mobile responsive so i kind of
14:02 - like that it's mobile responsive
14:04 - um the one thing though
14:07 - is that if you're on a phone
14:11 - i mean i don't exactly understand how i
14:13 - would scroll past
14:15 - oh my computer is crashing
14:18 - i don't understand like i would have to
14:20 - scroll through this entire table
14:22 - right to be able to scroll past and go
14:25 - you know what i mean like i don't know
14:26 - how i would get to this
14:27 - part without scrolling through the
14:29 - entire table
14:30 - so it might be like a little frustrating
14:32 - experience on mobile so maybe i would
14:33 - think about like
14:35 - how can i put all of this stuff at the
14:38 - bottom
14:39 - you know at the top yeah and also the
14:42 - those graphs at the bottom i would make
14:44 - those full screen
14:45 - i would make like when you go to mobile
14:46 - i would make those graphs be like full
14:48 - screen grabs not yet
14:49 - full screen okay smart so like on mobile
14:53 - responsiveness
14:54 - i mean for me this is like a seven out
14:57 - of ten
14:58 - yeah okay so so mobile responsiveness
15:01 - could be
15:01 - improved but i think in terms of
15:05 - this i mean it's pretty good like
15:08 - for me it looks like almost a nine out
15:10 - of ten
15:11 - i honestly can't think of what's it yeah
15:13 - i would say i would say
15:14 - an eight and a half an eight i would say
15:16 - yeah that's pretty good that's pretty
15:18 - good yeah
15:19 - okay awesome so that's what we would
15:23 - give the ronio one i think it's pretty
15:24 - good
15:26 - let's move on i mean i i also want to
15:28 - kind of get to these like drastically
15:31 - unique designs so
15:32 - should we go in an order or should we
15:34 - kind of go like
15:35 - whichever one we feel like going to
15:37 - first let's let's just go in and order
15:39 - really quickly like
15:40 - like not spend too much time just going
15:42 - over really quickly let's do it
15:43 - okay cool so here's one by tommy
15:47 - kelly so let's take a look at this
15:51 - nice i see the search table at the top
15:53 - something cool is about to happen here
15:55 - okay so tips for using the site
15:59 - nice click the column i mean might be a
16:01 - little like frustrating experience on
16:03 - mobile because you see how small that
16:05 - crosses
16:07 - yeah yeah that's true that's gonna be
16:08 - pretty annoying to close
16:10 - so um and even in regular i think it's
16:14 - gonna be kind of annoying to close let
16:15 - me click outside of it
16:16 - see if i click outside of it it seems
16:18 - like it's not going away
16:20 - yeah so i kind of have to like also to
16:24 - be fair
16:24 - i have to make sure it's 150 and then
16:27 - i'll click x so
16:30 - that it that kills the appeal of your
16:33 - program honestly because
16:34 - of your app because even if it's going
16:36 - to be something fancy you don't want to
16:37 - start it off with something that looks
16:39 - crappy so i would remove that
16:41 - i would remove that but look at that i
16:44 - mean he
16:44 - is taking up the whole real estate bro
16:46 - check this out damn
16:48 - that's true that's true i do like that
16:51 - one thing i really like about this
16:52 - is honestly when i'm using this uh
16:55 - tables are really important for me so
16:56 - even when i was looking at the
16:57 - coronavirus cases
16:59 - i wanted to see by like i want to be
17:02 - able to sort by desks recovered
17:04 - that was important like it so like i
17:06 - want to be able to sort by cases and see
17:08 - what's number one what's number two
17:11 - so that actually oh actually i like that
17:14 - so like i feel like we should also rate
17:17 - these apps
17:18 - not just on how they look but also their
17:19 - functionality as well
17:21 - so for me so far this app has more
17:24 - functionality than all of the other ones
17:26 - that we've seen so far
17:27 - so i would actually on the functionality
17:30 - scale give it
17:31 - give it a higher um oh look at this bro
17:35 - look at the search functionality look
17:37 - usa
17:39 - oh man
17:43 - that is nice okay i i'm sorry but i'm
17:45 - gonna uh from what we've seen
17:47 - this takes the kick over the last few
17:49 - ones like by miles
17:52 - yeah i'll get i'll get i'll give this a
17:53 - nine i'll give this a nine out of ten
17:55 - i'll get this one
17:55 - man yeah this is nine out of like
17:57 - especially like how
17:58 - quick i mean look at this bro croatia
18:01 - like instant like this is actually more
18:03 - useful than
18:04 - most of the apps that are online guys
18:07 - what do you think what what would you
18:08 - give give tommy guys drop in the comment
18:10 - below what number
18:11 - and like look as soon as i type in india
18:14 - india actually pops up
18:17 - and right away pops up nice that is very
18:20 - good touch i like that that's a good
18:21 - touch
18:22 - so click on that and click on recover
18:24 - i'm curious
18:25 - okay let's click on recovered oh the
18:28 - total recover changes at the bottom
18:30 - and the map changes that is nice
18:34 - and it looks like he has sim he has
18:36 - symptoms
18:38 - so he even has videos and news playing
18:41 - that's really cool new covered law
18:44 - oh wow i can actually click it and it
18:46 - expands
18:47 - that's dude that's nice that's useful
18:50 - like look at that
18:51 - study provides comprehensive view of
18:53 - cursive venomous snakes and snake bites
18:54 - in the middle east
18:56 - um i mean that's not really connected to
18:59 - don't exactly know what's happening
19:01 - there snake bites snake bites you know
19:04 - with kobe you know
19:06 - i think this is this is useful and the
19:08 - top one is useful and then he got tweets
19:11 - and cnn
19:12 - that's super cool bro cause that's
19:13 - useful like twitter new
19:15 - news is useful the other news stuff like
19:17 - looks scammy
19:18 - but like if you have twitter things
19:20 - pulled up that looks like really
19:22 - relevant and like yeah
19:24 - i something i can trust so i like the
19:26 - twitter embeds that he has
19:29 - yeah i would say functionality
19:30 - definitely like a 10 out of 10
19:31 - functionality-wise
19:33 - like for me like 10 out of 10 10 out of
19:35 - 10 for like functionality
19:36 - honestly like looks i would give it a 9
19:39 - out of 10
19:40 - 9 out of 10 mainly because i think like
19:41 - for example that twitter
19:43 - the twitter tweets at the bottom like
19:47 - you know how it goes goes all the way
19:49 - down i think it could be a little bit
19:50 - improved to make it to make
19:52 - use of more real estate um so yeah
19:55 - i would i would i would use the twitter
19:56 - up but like look at the responsiveness
19:58 - so like
19:59 - when i go from full to like this already
20:01 - it's like
20:03 - doing such a good job with
20:04 - responsiveness wow
20:07 - and then go to a really small one let's
20:08 - go oh man this guy has like every case
20:11 - like figured out
20:13 - guys this is crazy i mean this is
20:16 - crazy because
20:16 - this is what we learn in profit with
20:19 - javascript like i mean seriously right
20:21 - this is crazy we learn how to make not
20:24 - just applications but mobile friendly
20:25 - applications i mean
20:27 - the whole shebang this is this is really
20:29 - really awesome
20:30 - okay so this one i'm gonna rate it
20:32 - pretty high
20:34 - um definitely just in my mind this is
20:37 - yeah like this is gonna be there so
20:39 - great job
20:40 - tommy on this so let's keep it moving so
20:43 - great
20:46 - let's go to abdullah tahir we've already
20:48 - seen his
20:49 - let's take a look at ahmed's because
20:51 - that looks really cool
20:53 - i like how this one looks
20:56 - oh by the way if you guys want to check
20:57 - it out you can also go to this website
21:00 - uh the link is at the top
21:04 - maybe i can drop it in the comments so
21:08 - yeah drop in the comments i just dropped
21:10 - the link in the comments so you guys
21:12 - could go
21:12 - to it and play around with it
21:17 - okay let's see here
21:21 - whoa that looks beautiful it's beautiful
21:25 - but okay hold on before i say something
21:30 - this page can't load google maps
21:32 - correctly do you own this website
21:34 - okay that's fine it's just google map
21:36 - stuff
21:38 - that's api key stuff okay so let's see
21:42 - okay that is really cool that i can
21:44 - hover over a country and it kind of
21:46 - highlights it so
21:47 - that's really cool i like how it says
21:49 - 123
21:50 - 761. i like what it looks like
21:57 - okay um actually click on a circle click
21:58 - on that circle quasi
22:02 - just zooms in so honestly
22:06 - like
22:10 - it's what are you talking about i don't
22:12 - like it i don't like it
22:14 - and the reason why i don't like this is
22:16 - because um
22:19 - i don't know like i feel like on mobile
22:21 - this any type of map stuff is always a
22:24 - nightmare and like really confusing
22:26 - and like once you zoom in you kind of
22:27 - don't know how to zoom out is it like do
22:29 - i use my mouse wheel to zoom out
22:31 - is it command minus command plus but
22:33 - holy crap that's like zooming in on my
22:35 - chrome screen um and i don't exactly i
22:38 - don't have a sense of direction on this
22:40 - app i don't know
22:41 - where am i supposed to click or what's
22:43 - happening yeah like where to go
22:45 - what to look at right and like just
22:47 - right now even how
22:48 - slowly it's loading and then also those
22:51 - numbers look really great
22:53 - oh something is happening on the
22:54 - left hand side that's looking really
22:56 - nice
22:57 - whoa i mean yeah that does
23:01 - that looks pretty good that looks great
23:05 - that looks great yeah
23:08 - yeah i saw that i thought i was like
23:09 - holy that looks amazing
23:11 - the map though yeah i think you know
23:13 - having the map is full screen probably
23:15 - not the best
23:16 - like if he if he had that thing on the
23:18 - left-hand side be always
23:19 - open yeah
23:24 - because that already will give you some
23:26 - intuition and honestly i wouldn't i
23:28 - wouldn't use the map like he's using it
23:30 - he's making the map everything i would
23:32 - like have like a little
23:33 - search bar where you can type in your
23:35 - country name and then like this stuff on
23:37 - the left opens up
23:38 - that will blow people's minds
23:41 - yeah we got another donation thank you
23:43 - guys for
23:45 - okay seriously
23:48 - yeah we got another donation that's
23:50 - awesome thank you all right okay okay
23:53 - so i i really yeah what do you guys
23:56 - think about this i mean i really like
23:57 - this i think if he had a search bar
24:00 - right around like here so it's very
24:03 - clear that i'm like looking for
24:04 - countries
24:05 - and then boom i do that and maps i would
24:08 - make it like much smaller probably like
24:10 - maps isn't that
24:11 - useful and it's also kind of clunky when
24:14 - you click on it and stuff
24:15 - so i would not make it like the main
24:17 - part because now i'm lost
24:18 - like the only way i can search up united
24:20 - states is to somehow
24:21 - find it to click it i'm not gonna do
24:24 - that that's too much work
24:25 - now there are some icons at the bottom
24:27 - so i'll click it it says didn't finish
24:29 - it yet hahaha that's funny
24:33 - it toggles between it seems like night
24:35 - mode and the other mode
24:37 - holy crap it says countries updated
24:39 - province has updated cities updated so
24:41 - that's nice
24:42 - it has like these things looks like he's
24:45 - got a bunch of pop-ups
24:46 - all right okay wow that's cool look at
24:49 - okay that is really cool so take a look
24:50 - at that when i click this at the bottom
24:53 - you see how at the bottom it like
24:54 - expands into three different things one
24:56 - is confirmed cases one is recovered
24:59 - and then one says dead so let's go ahead
25:02 - and hit recovered and let's see what
25:03 - happens maybe the whole map changes to
25:05 - recovered oh i mean the front end of
25:09 - this is
25:09 - pretty clean it's slow but it's really
25:12 - clean
25:13 - a lot of functionality i'll give you
25:14 - that for sure a lot of functionality
25:19 - is there music i don't know where it's
25:22 - coming from but
25:25 - is that you where's the music coming
25:27 - from
25:28 - no i think it's coming from the side
25:29 - because somebody's somebody said get
25:30 - ready for something
25:32 - for some music nobody else can hear it
25:35 - only i can hear it
25:38 - oh man all right well
25:41 - what where's the dance you know
25:42 - virtually dance virtual dance
25:44 - yeah okay um i have to turn it off i
25:47 - mean the music is lit
25:49 - good song choice that's a great song
25:52 - i love it how much how much how much
25:54 - would we give this project what do you
25:55 - think
25:57 - people are like now 10 because there's a
25:59 - music there's music
26:01 - so what's cool about that when you click
26:02 - it let's see there's like uh there's
26:04 - some other stuff
26:05 - some attachment stuff and then
26:08 - some table so like let's click so table
26:11 - side
26:12 - man your app is so awesome it's being
26:16 - destroyed by google maps
26:18 - honestly if you started using google
26:20 - made google maps extremely small
26:23 - your app would be so useful because like
26:25 - your front-end design is awesome
26:27 - i love what you're doing within where
26:28 - you're headed with it but it's just like
26:30 - it's so damn slow because of how the map
26:32 - renders
26:33 - um and i can even see this is how i
26:36 - became
26:36 - i'd coded okay so
26:40 - it's doing it's doing some cool stuff on
26:42 - the side but yeah i would definitely
26:44 - ease up on the google maps other than
26:46 - that i think this is great what
26:47 - so nas what do you think yeah i like
26:50 - that i mean
26:51 - i love the fun listen a lot of work was
26:53 - put in this for sure you know
26:55 - yeah in terms of like like even having
26:57 - it where you click on that button and
26:58 - then also
26:58 - like you know it goes in and stuff like
27:00 - that that's a lot of work right so yes
27:02 - i have a lot of work you for that that's
27:05 - a lot of work though i
27:06 - think that you know always think that
27:08 - simpler is better
27:10 - right simpler is better you want to put
27:12 - into account the user experience this is
27:14 - a cool ui but the user experience of it
27:18 - may not be like
27:19 - the best mainly because i don't know
27:21 - what to do like i'll see a map that's
27:23 - cool
27:24 - but i'm here to get from about covet and
27:26 - i want to see that straight away
27:28 - right so that's what i would say i would
27:30 - give it i would probably give it like an
27:32 - eight out of ten
27:32 - i would say like give it a give it eight
27:34 - out of ten point
27:36 - yeah this is really this app is really
27:39 - great
27:39 - um ahmed so take this critique with like
27:43 - you know just open your mind so don't be
27:44 - offended by it but take it really for
27:46 - what it is like
27:48 - i would basically say for me this app is
27:51 - a
27:52 - six out of ten and their only reason is
27:54 - that i wouldn't use it
27:57 - so that's the only problem just because
27:59 - the user experience is really slow and
28:01 - everything like that
28:02 - but overall the app is beautiful it has
28:06 - so many
28:06 - cool things but the problem is that the
28:09 - users probably wouldn't even wait around
28:11 - to see all those cool things so you want
28:12 - to figure out how you can highlight
28:14 - those things
28:15 - in a much simpler and a faster way but
28:18 - other than that i'm a
28:19 - great job on this so yeah
28:22 - i i'll maybe even have like a running
28:26 - list i'm writing yeah i actually have i
28:29 - have a running list
28:30 - as well yeah okay none of my pens are
28:32 - working
28:33 - okay cool nah i got it thank you all
28:36 - right so now let's go to gens
28:38 - so jen is a professional software
28:39 - developer who's in our community profit
28:41 - with javascript chad is amazing
28:45 - jen is awesome we can actually even pull
28:48 - up jen so let's see
28:51 - i don't know why it's going so slow yeah
28:54 - why is your thing going so slow it's
28:56 - true
28:57 - it's funny that my laptop is way faster
29:00 - than this
29:02 - so this is our community of profit with
29:04 - javascript we have tons and tons of
29:06 - amazing people and let's see if we can
29:07 - pull up jen
29:10 - but jen is
29:16 - it's lagging right it's slow yeah so jen
29:19 - is right there so we're going to be
29:20 - taking a look at jen's
29:22 - project i think it's going to be a great
29:24 - project i got good
29:25 - feeling about this um got a high school
29:28 - station jen
29:31 - jen come on what is happening here what
29:34 - is all this
29:38 - oh yeah i mean i mean i mean look i mean
29:40 - we had it we had it where you know
29:42 - you really we limited the width of the
29:44 - project
29:45 - but yeah i got it maybe maybe it could
29:47 - have been centered or something
29:49 - but okay look active cases and recovered
29:51 - and debts looks
29:52 - clean that looks clean i love the hover
29:55 - effect the hover effect is pretty good i
29:58 - love the hover effect
29:59 - yeah yeah and and i think actually one
30:02 - thing to guys remember one really cool
30:03 - thing here is
30:04 - oh jen jen is on here she says you guys
30:06 - are too sweet
30:07 - i love that nice i just highlighted a
30:10 - comment
30:11 - sorry in a second i think jen you're
30:13 - going to be saying we're not sweet
30:16 - but okay go ahead dogs so i one thing
30:19 - that i love what jen did is like if you
30:21 - look at the projects right
30:22 - it's about the color the color you know
30:25 - choice that she made you see how for
30:26 - example she has the green as the title
30:28 - right the code 19 tracker is the green
30:30 - and then for example the map is also
30:32 - green right so she's keeping consistency
30:34 - within the whole application in terms of
30:36 - like colors right
30:38 - yeah i love that that is really good
30:40 - that's one of the hardest things to do
30:41 - guys
30:41 - a lot of people would just put a bunch
30:43 - of colors together you know and they
30:44 - know you know and then you know
30:45 - and have it work but but with her i love
30:48 - how she had
30:49 - kept the consistency that she kept like
30:51 - the you know the green
30:52 - color scheme which is great yeah that's
30:55 - really good
30:56 - um so that's awesome i like the
30:59 - consistency
31:00 - i like the how the tables are here and
31:01 - they're kind of by default sorted by the
31:03 - most
31:04 - i don't know why most people didn't do
31:06 - that but like by default i think it
31:09 - should be sorted by the most cases
31:10 - because that's what i look for
31:12 - whenever i'm looking up any coronavirus
31:14 - stuff i want to know
31:15 - where what's the number one country
31:17 - what's the number two what's number
31:19 - three like i didn't know russia was like
31:21 - right there number four yeah
31:24 - number one another functionality that
31:26 - like i just realized it has that i
31:27 - didn't even know
31:28 - there was like no way for me to know it
31:29 - would even have it is the fact that i
31:31 - can click on russia's text and click it
31:34 - and then it actually takes me to it you
31:35 - guys watching that oh
31:37 - no way really yeah so when i actually
31:39 - click on russia
31:40 - it takes me to it and all these the only
31:42 - thing i would say
31:43 - is if you want to make it a
31:45 - functionality that i can
31:46 - see maybe like a little effect that
31:50 - happens when i go on it like it gets a
31:52 - little darker or something or
31:53 - at least my mouse should turn into like
31:56 - a pointer
31:58 - yeah like the hand pointer like the hand
32:00 - pointer right just that alone would tell
32:02 - me that this functionality exists
32:04 - so that's really cool and let's go here
32:07 - now when i go to brazil
32:10 - okay it's a zero recovery today okay i
32:12 - think that's that's fair
32:15 - india nice i mean i love whoa
32:20 - 49 000 plus cases today in india
32:24 - oh wow damn that's actually a
32:28 - useful
32:29 - functionality that's really really
32:30 - useful and what i would even do
32:32 - to really let the user know that they
32:35 - clicked on india and it's selected is
32:37 - maybe even it has like a color
32:39 - that like highlights it to just make it
32:41 - look like that that's active right now
32:43 - when we click india yeah having an
32:46 - active state and a hover state so right
32:48 - yeah kind of a hover state when you
32:49 - hover over like
32:50 - you know on the tab on the on the map or
32:52 - not on the map but on that specific
32:53 - country
32:54 - that'll be great right yeah exactly that
32:57 - would be awesome let's let
32:59 - let's look at the one the news uh below
33:01 - what does she have in there the news
33:03 - um nice okay so she's pulling the news
33:07 - from the guardian that's
33:08 - that's a good source i like that you
33:09 - wrote this uh source
33:11 - maybe even drop the logo because when
33:14 - people come to these types of websites i
33:16 - think like it's hard to
33:17 - trust what's happening like they're
33:19 - gonna be like oh this these
33:20 - you know jen is running a scam here but
33:23 - when you
33:24 - either add a little logo or why i like
33:27 - twitter
33:28 - embeds is because the proof is all right
33:30 - there
33:31 - like you just trust twitter so you're
33:33 - much more likely to click it but i still
33:35 - really like how she did it yeah
33:38 - yeah yeah so i love it i think it's good
33:41 - you know
33:41 - functionality is you know functionality
33:43 - is pretty good as well
33:45 - right i know some other people have done
33:46 - that some even extra functionality but
33:48 - you know hers is pretty clean
33:49 - and let's go ahead and check let's go
33:51 - ahead and check if it's more friendly as
33:52 - well just really quickly
33:53 - i i do like how she has the total and
33:55 - all that underneath it like in the plus
33:57 - 631 today like that is cool let's just
34:01 - check mobile friendly
34:03 - okay so in this view it already becomes
34:05 - mobile friendly so that's great now
34:07 - let's go to a smaller
34:10 - like a mobile nice that's great
34:14 - very mobile friendly very mobile
34:16 - friendly i love that
34:18 - that's cool so great job i love how
34:21 - we're creating
34:22 - these applications like just that's
34:24 - clean you know mobile friendly and clean
34:26 - i love it man
34:27 - yeah so this is this is really good so
34:29 - great job on this
34:31 - jen yeah uh this is awesome i would
34:35 - go ahead i'll give it a nine point
34:37 - attack and 9.5 out of 10.
34:38 - and only the reason why is this is
34:40 - really good but i just think yet you
34:41 - know from other students what they have
34:43 - done like you could have added some
34:44 - even more for example maybe it's twitter
34:47 - and bad maybe
34:48 - it's even symptoms maybe you know for
34:50 - what we had different students do i
34:51 - think it could have done even
34:52 - more potentially yeah so really good
34:56 - that's great yeah my score on this would
34:59 - be
34:59 - like eight out of ten and only just for
35:01 - a few reasons
35:02 - one is there's a lot of space
35:05 - not being used here um the fact that
35:08 - when i click on some functionality
35:10 - that's there that like i
35:11 - don't because hover state or active
35:13 - state isn't here so i would probably
35:15 - knock off some points for that and um
35:19 - you know and also like india when i
35:20 - click it like the flag and everything
35:22 - should come up right over there you know
35:25 - like the fact that the flag doesn't
35:27 - automatically come up
35:28 - um and you know if it's a smaller
35:30 - country you're never going to find it
35:32 - like you're never going to be able to
35:33 - see where
35:34 - it's even located and for news
35:37 - i would see i would feel like if you had
35:39 - twitter embeds that could actually make
35:40 - it better so for me this is going to be
35:42 - an 8 out of 10.
35:44 - cool cool cool awesome let's move
35:47 - on to other projects ooh i'm excited
35:50 - let's look but guys what would you give
35:52 - jen
35:53 - drop in the comments what would you give
35:54 - jen right there drop in the comment guys
35:56 - yep drop it in the comments guys and let
35:58 - us let us know people are saying nine

36:27 - getting tons of ratings on this
36:28 - eight eight point five ruby okay great
36:32 - okay guys let's move on to the next
36:37 - next project so i think that project
36:39 - let's just put
36:42 - them ahoy remember guys
36:46 - a few things we want to tell you is
36:48 - remember
36:49 - this project the winner will get 500
36:53 - second place we'll get 250 and then
36:55 - third place
36:56 - gets 100 these are all of our students
36:59 - in our course profit with javascript if
37:01 - you want to check out that course link
37:03 - is in the description
37:04 - we have a free javascript training as
37:06 - well that's over one hour long link is
37:08 - in the description
37:09 - and we're currently reviewing all of the
37:12 - students projects
37:13 - that submitted it from our profit
37:15 - javascript community
37:16 - so let's keep it rolling let's go on to
37:20 - this project right here i'm pumped to
37:22 - see what's happening here because it
37:23 - looks pretty unique
37:24 - oh man i already like this this is
37:28 - oh i feel so good looking at this one
37:31 - and um i love everything that has like a
37:34 - landing page type
37:36 - of vibe to it just because i'm so used
37:38 - to you know coming to a page that has
37:40 - something
37:42 - don't exactly know what we're
37:43 - downloading though so
37:46 - yeah i think i think maybe like i think
37:48 - that maybe like wanted to have like an
37:50 - app
37:50 - like an android ios app but got it got
37:53 - it that would be cool that would be
37:54 - really cool
37:55 - so okay so let's go here i mean it's i
37:58 - love the
37:59 - landing page of it like this would
38:01 - actually make you download this app like
38:03 - i would want to
38:04 - yeah if it had something i would
38:05 - download it on my phone and look at it
38:07 - yeah people are saying this looks
38:08 - amazing
38:10 - um okay
38:13 - so let's go here total cases
38:16 - i don't know i don't i'm not a huge fan
38:18 - of this color coding it
38:20 - doesn't it's not like intuitive at all
38:23 - the fact that i have to like actually
38:24 - pay attention to your color coding
38:27 - is not a good sign because like why
38:30 - is the most dense black like that by
38:32 - default should be red
38:34 - the most red should be the most cases
38:37 - and why is red like in the middle
38:39 - so weird like i don't know like that to
38:43 - me is
38:45 - uh hard to read i like though how the
38:48 - case is recovered and deaths are
38:51 - yeah i love that and you see and i think
38:53 - i also love
38:54 - like how that if you switch like a
38:56 - different country so let's say like
38:58 - let's say we do like usa so let's search
39:01 - usa for example so instead of global
39:03 - data it should also say
39:04 - worldwide because global data is not
39:06 - clear what that is
39:08 - okay i'm not in usa if you see it yeah
39:10 - like recover for example i love that
39:12 - i actually like that recovered the
39:14 - button that recovered um
39:16 - uh bar that like goes left and right
39:19 - yeah it looks fills up
39:21 - yeah like fills up which is now how many
39:23 - people recover from the cases
39:25 - you know and it kind of zooms in and i
39:26 - like that little like
39:29 - usa um that little like section that
39:33 - that card on the right hand side which
39:34 - is really cool because it's like it
39:36 - gives you like a place
39:37 - exactly where you need to look at right
39:39 - so yes i really like that part
39:41 - actually uh the news is one of the best
39:45 - how you've put together is literally
39:48 - probably the best how it looks so great
39:51 - job on the news portion you crushed it
39:53 - keep the distance stay at home wash your
39:55 - hands crushed it with that
39:58 - oh man i love tables why are you hiding
40:00 - the tables those are my favorite because
40:02 - that's actually what i want to use
40:04 - um so can you search for in a table can
40:07 - you search in a table or no
40:09 - yeah yeah nice so it's really fast
40:12 - search
40:12 - but it like has a little weird
40:14 - experience on it so like it
40:15 - literally jumps oh wow moves my entire
40:19 - app
40:20 - so i would i would because when i'm on
40:23 - mobile it'll be a really frustrating
40:24 - experience to have this happen to me
40:27 - but i love the search so functionality
40:29 - wise already you
40:30 - took the cake above a lot of people
40:32 - because that's what i do when i come to
40:33 - a covid app or i want to look at stats
40:36 - i'm going straight to the tables and i'm
40:38 - searching and sorting and stuff like
40:40 - that so
40:41 - this honestly should be higher up
40:44 - because people want to look at those
40:45 - trends
40:47 - like i like to look at the trends and
40:51 - the growth
40:52 - for me the functionality is based a lot
40:54 - on the like if i'm looking at the covet
40:56 - about
40:57 - kind of gut wise i'm judging it on
41:00 - if i look at a covet app i'm judging it
41:02 - on
41:04 - you know is it showing me the rate of
41:07 - growth of of whatever like whether it be
41:11 - the rate of growth
41:12 - of debts cases
41:15 - recovered um
41:18 - and i'm also like judging it on
41:23 - uh like table searchable
41:27 - table so can i like search countries
41:31 - and how fast can i do it and can i sort
41:34 - them because i want to look at like
41:35 - which are the top countries that are
41:37 - affected that's generally what i'm
41:38 - looking at so
41:40 - and i think a lot of people are so i
41:41 - would definitely make sure that those
41:43 - things
41:45 - are are a little more thought out and i
41:47 - would like
41:48 - i value that even over looking at a map
41:52 - you know so yeah just a good user
41:53 - experience exactly you don't have to
41:55 - remove the map
41:57 - but like maybe even you can make the map
41:59 - a little bit smaller
42:00 - but that table view it looks nice but
42:03 - here
42:04 - on the table yeah i feel like i like
42:06 - have like a table view near the map you
42:08 - have a table
42:09 - like above like all the way above near
42:10 - the mapping potentially right so
42:12 - i feel like that could have been even
42:14 - part of it as well also it's hard to see
42:16 - go ahead go ahead nas
42:18 - and i would oh so he has total stats and
42:20 - new cases okay so
42:21 - he does cover that i like that okay cool
42:23 - yeah
42:24 - but actually honestly what i like about
42:26 - this is again i love his color
42:29 - his color choice guys like you know very
42:32 - just
42:32 - clean and crisp right and he can keeps
42:35 - consistency which is good
42:36 - so it's a clean sight right it's
42:38 - something you would build
42:40 - but i think yeah again the user
42:41 - experience can definitely improve a
42:42 - little bit
42:44 - yeah yeah especially like that map when
42:47 - you search when you search on the map
42:48 - like it just kind of jumps to the center
42:49 - nah
42:50 - nah i think you do better you got this
42:52 - you can do better
42:59 - what's up guys
43:03 - because i was like yeah it's crazy
43:07 - because um for me i feel
43:08 - i literally it seems to me like we're
43:10 - like 10 minutes behind like the lag is
43:12 - that bad
43:13 - because i'm looking at the youtube but
43:15 - frankie's like it's looking great so i'm
43:17 - just gonna keep it
43:18 - rolling um but yeah hopefully
43:21 - yeah right now people are looking at
43:23 - this app that we're looking at right
43:24 - so cool i mean i think overall this is
43:27 - great
43:28 - um a few things like when i hit like the
43:31 - like i would never know to click on this
43:34 - because
43:34 - it has a strikethrough and that to me
43:37 - doesn't speak like hey this is another
43:39 - functionality
43:40 - so i would never know to click on it
43:44 - that i feel like this table
43:47 - is very like it could be i like the
43:50 - functionality so the functionality of
43:52 - this table
43:53 - is a 10 you know 10 out of 10
43:56 - but like the user experience and the
43:58 - front end of this table is not good
44:00 - so i would work on that other than that
44:03 - this is a
44:04 - phenomenally done app it's very creative
44:07 - and
44:08 - it looks professional like if i saw this
44:11 - i would actually think it's like a
44:12 - professional app
44:14 - this is crazy i know i i like yeah i
44:15 - know i like this i like this a lot
44:17 - actually you know but like
44:18 - again yeah and also yeah that that table
44:21 - as well yeah it doesn't
44:22 - fit in with the whole application like
44:23 - you did so good on
44:25 - all these other top parts but like the
44:27 - table just kind of like you know
44:28 - just kind of like black you know not
44:31 - black but like gray and white so i think
44:32 - you definitely could have done better on
44:34 - there maybe some padding more margin
44:36 - more padding you know and different
44:37 - colors for the table
44:39 - yep so overall uh i would
44:42 - give this app and
44:46 - you know i would give this app an 8.5
44:49 - probably
44:50 - yeah i would i would give it a nine i'll
44:52 - give it a nine okay
44:55 - awesome so let's keep the ball rolling
44:58 - okay
44:59 - so now let's go to the next one abdul
45:02 - salaam so if it i mean it looks very if
45:04 - it looks very similar to the other ones
45:06 - we're not going to spend too much time
45:08 - on it to be honest just
45:09 - just for the sake of time yeah but let's
45:12 - see
45:13 - so let me go to 150 percent where it
45:17 - would look
45:18 - sort of normal i like that bar
45:21 - that bar graph pretty cool bar chart
45:23 - that's pretty cool yeah
45:26 - i like the bar chart at the bottom i
45:28 - like the
45:30 - text he's using the font i like his font
45:32 - a lot
45:34 - i think these stats are not accurate
45:36 - though so that's a big miss
45:38 - like i would definitely make sure my
45:40 - facts are accurate when i'm building an
45:42 - app
45:42 - so the facts are off here so that's a
45:45 - huge minus on the functionality side and
45:47 - i honestly care more about the
45:48 - functionality than even
45:49 - because i'd rather use wikipedia because
45:51 - i know it'll be like accurate or i'll
45:53 - use some crappy site
45:55 - that's interesting i don't know why
45:56 - those stats are off like that maybe i
45:58 - don't know
45:59 - that's really that's really weird yeah
46:01 - but i know for example usa has 4 million
46:04 - 4 million and then behind usa is some
46:06 - other country
46:07 - brazil with 2 million so it says last
46:09 - updated july 28th but i don't really
46:11 - know if it is
46:13 - um okay so i would give i would give
46:15 - this like i would get this like honestly
46:17 - like probably like
46:18 - an eight and eight or so yeah i would
46:21 - say
46:21 - for the images use the thing that sunny
46:25 - taught you guys with
46:26 - object fit because look these are not
46:29 - pixel perfect images they're squished so
46:32 - you're taking images and you're
46:34 - squishing them and it's very visible
46:35 - that they're squished
46:37 - so otherwise these circular images would
46:39 - look great but if you actually use that
46:41 - like
46:42 - object fit line in css it'll make them
46:45 - perfect so i would yeah just focus on
46:47 - that
46:48 - um i like i'll also focus sorry sorry
46:51 - go for it also focus on the code 19 so
46:53 - you have code 19 to learn code 19
46:55 - symptoms
46:56 - like the information on cover 19 you
46:58 - know i'll
46:59 - you'll want to put like um some kind of
47:01 - a text on what is
47:02 - you know what are you going to be
47:03 - talking about below you know the the
47:05 - table above says total life cases by
47:07 - countries
47:08 - then you might want to have some other
47:09 - text that says you know covet you know
47:11 - covet uh so people are saying people are
47:14 - saying that
47:15 - he basically subtracted the
47:18 - debts from the recovered or whatever and
47:21 - that's how you're getting this
47:22 - but honestly but i i still
47:26 - that's no justification even though it
47:28 - says live cases because
47:29 - if it's not if nas and i are both
47:32 - confused by it
47:33 - a lot of people are gonna be so it
47:35 - doesn't matter so even if you do
47:36 - something like fancy and intelligent
47:39 - it doesn't matter if most people get
47:41 - confused by it so you sometimes have to
47:43 - even give up your fanciness
47:45 - to just make something people get right
47:47 - away that's really important
47:51 - i'll say so too i would say so too
47:53 - scroll down
47:55 - i think that the news as well could have
47:57 - been could it could be
47:58 - could be a little bit better in terms of
48:00 - you know how it's formatted
48:02 - yeah so that's cool that i can download
48:04 - it but honestly i don't care to download
48:06 - it that much
48:07 - but it's still cool maybe if i'm like a
48:09 - data analyst
48:10 - but like i was also not very clear to me
48:12 - what i am exactly downloading i do
48:15 - love how he has top countries with
48:17 - today's new cases so like we know that's
48:18 - cool
48:19 - today for today india had the most cases
48:22 - which is really which is like
48:23 - which is really interesting like that's
48:24 - i didn't know that so that is
48:26 - interesting yeah i like that
48:28 - so yeah let's let's so kaiju let's give
48:30 - this like a a number let's move on let's
48:32 - keep going
48:33 - okay cool so yeah so i'm gonna give this
48:37 - a i don't know i think like
48:40 - it's 7.5
48:44 - okay cool and i'll give it an eight yeah
48:46 - just because like my stats when they're
48:48 - not right on kovid then that's
48:50 - problem cool let's keep going
48:53 - okay cool so here is this one
48:59 - what was that what was the name of the
49:01 - last one the person who did it
49:03 - abdul
49:06 - okay cool dang interesting so nice
49:09 - centered i like that oh interesting
49:12 - design
49:15 - uh okay cool hold on let's see
49:18 - keep going i think the graphs got a
49:21 - little too complicated here
49:24 - so i mean unless you
49:27 - are having like data scientists come to
49:29 - your website like this
49:30 - is freaking oh yeah
49:33 - those graphs i would not want to look at
49:36 - it
49:37 - so um grade function functionality wise
49:40 - great clean
49:43 - i like i like it i mean it's pretty
49:45 - clean in terms of like it's centered
49:47 - right we know it's pretty clean i like
49:49 - that it just it kind of
49:50 - you know it feels friendly right
49:54 - but like yeah that graph is like weird
49:55 - yeah um
49:57 - yeah yeah the okay the table looks nice
50:00 - so great job on that the table looks
50:03 - good
50:05 - one thing i would say if you centered
50:06 - everything like i think who's it
50:08 - mustapha if you already centered
50:10 - everything then the search box should
50:12 - also be centered too
50:14 - yeah so i would say that yeah the search
50:15 - box should be centered right
50:17 - and then also for your
50:21 - people are like data scientists ll um
50:24 - also
50:24 - for your like i'm having trouble reading
50:27 - this
50:27 - off the patch so i'm like 167 000. i'm
50:30 - like no no no
50:31 - uh yeah 1.6 million and then i'm like no
50:35 - no no
50:36 - 16 million and then i'm like oh yeah
50:38 - that's 16 million so don't make me like
50:42 - don't make me do work when i come to
50:44 - your website you know
50:45 - like just make it really simple for me
50:47 - so like
50:48 - definite so functionality wise i'm gonna
50:50 - dock off those points from the
50:52 - functionality
50:54 - i would definitely have commas
50:57 - now let's check mobile friendly so here
51:00 - let's go
51:01 - cool that's great what happens when i
51:03 - choose
51:04 - usa nice
51:08 - um zooms in okay something kind of
51:10 - really much okay
51:11 - i don't really know what it does on the
51:13 - map like it doesn't really do anything
51:14 - it doesn't even bring up the flag so
51:16 - don't like what it does on the map like
51:18 - okay great i can read the text united
51:20 - states
51:20 - like that's that's not that useful let
51:23 - me
51:24 - i do like that table though like that
51:26 - table is like pretty clean it's just
51:28 - that table is not that table is not uh
51:31 - what's it called
51:32 - is uh not sorted or is it i'm not sure
51:35 - maybe it's not yeah
51:36 - mobile friendly wise it's not that great
51:39 - like mobile friendly like this is weird
51:41 - to look at this on mobile so you know
51:45 - like
51:45 - looking at a map that's just like blank
51:47 - it's confusing
51:48 - then i don't even know how you scroll
51:50 - past a map on your phone without like
51:52 - starting to mess around with the map um
51:55 - yeah
51:56 - honestly guys map the map makes it a
51:58 - really poor experience like unless you
52:00 - use the map in a smart way where you
52:02 - don't make it so it's like the biggest
52:05 - thing on the screen if you kind of use
52:06 - it in a more
52:08 - like subtle way then it will look really
52:10 - great yeah yeah yeah
52:12 - yeah so and i think those active cases
52:14 - like in mobile could have
52:15 - definitely could have been better you
52:16 - could have made it like made that like
52:18 - full with 100
52:20 - or you know just put this up into four
52:22 - you know you don't have to do it like
52:23 - that so
52:24 - yeah that could have been done better as
52:26 - well so but nice job
52:28 - but nice job overall i like the
52:30 - creativity so just for
52:32 - even the creativity alone like the fact
52:34 - that you really went out of your way
52:36 - i mean i would have otherwise given it
52:37 - like 7.5 but i think with the creativity
52:40 - involved like
52:41 - i'm i'm just going to put in an 8 so
52:44 - nice job on i'll give i'll give it a 7.5
52:46 - mainly because like
52:47 - the format like i'm very particular with
52:49 - like the small little things because
52:50 - they make a big difference
52:52 - the formatting the numbers that kind of
52:53 - stuff it definitely could have been done
52:54 - better so i'll do it give it a 10.5 holy
52:56 - crap we're about to look at somebody who
52:58 - went
52:59 - the extreme way he's using freaking
53:01 - float
53:02 - precision big precision numbers
53:06 - wait we're looking at what i'll show you
53:09 - there's like an
53:09 - app coming up by i think it's by uh
53:12 - andres vegan and he's like using
53:15 - freaking floating numbers like point
53:17 - zero point oh bad we're going too
53:20 - advanced with that so oh okay let's go
53:24 - let's do let's select the tian now okay
53:27 - cool let's uh
53:28 - move forward oh tatiana nice okay
53:31 - yeah okay our students
53:34 - in in covet in uh javascript
53:39 - hold on now she's one of our students
53:41 - with coven
53:44 - oh man oh fancy
53:50 - i like that it's very fancy
53:54 - worldwide what i love i love about this
53:57 - one
53:57 - is number one colors and number two
54:01 - attention to detail yeah
54:05 - attention to detail very important yeah
54:08 - so
54:09 - graphs are really nice i like the little
54:11 - logos with the graphs
54:13 - so you guys use that to your advantage
54:14 - like active cases right
54:16 - and recovered cases it has a smiley face
54:19 - and then deaths have
54:20 - this i think jen had probably the best
54:22 - use of logos
54:24 - unless it was tommy kelly but
54:28 - so i like that there's mortality rate
54:30 - and all that that's
54:31 - very good i can hover over these
54:35 - so when i hover that looks really nice
54:37 - let me actually click recovered
54:40 - okay something happens okay the whole
54:43 - map changes
54:44 - wow the whole map turns table changes
54:46 - too the table changes as well
54:48 - okay so let's go take a look at so okay
54:51 - great let's go down so here's the table
54:53 - the table is changing
54:54 - top 10 active
54:58 - guys what do you think about this one
54:59 - guys let us know in the comments below
55:01 - let us know in the comments below yeah
55:02 - i like what she's done with the news it
55:04 - makes it look a lot more
55:06 - legit the fact that she's turned into
55:07 - these nice cards
55:09 - because most other people's news looks
55:12 - like
55:12 - um spam or like an ad like ads that you
55:16 - have don't look at so i like holy crap
55:19 - some people are giving it
55:20 - 10 e to the seventh power points
55:25 - yeah like four nine amazing amazing
55:29 - ten people loving this okay so i like
55:32 - that it even teaches you
55:34 - prevention that's really good let's go
55:36 - into symptoms
55:39 - that's that's cool the fact that okay
55:41 - that's really useful because i always
55:43 - want to know what are the symptoms of
55:44 - this so then i kind of want to go to
55:46 - other apps and then take a look at or
55:48 - i will google what are the symptoms so
55:50 - the fact that i can see
55:51 - fever and dry cough and fatigue that's
55:54 - really good sign
55:58 - okay and then you got resources so that
56:00 - tells me what you're
56:01 - doing okay nice learn more on who.net
56:05 - nice you're giving them credit that's
56:06 - really good you got your instagram
56:08 - and you got your github
56:11 - somebody said i love it three thousand
56:13 - holy yeah
56:15 - so let's see worldwide
56:18 - uh i can choose different countries nice
56:22 - okay
56:25 - all right cool so overall
56:28 - what would you give this one nas i will
56:31 - give this honestly
56:32 - honestly though i mean actually go go
56:35 - into a mobile view
56:40 - mobile view control view if the mobile
56:43 - is good i would give this a 10 out of
56:45 - 10.
56:47 - this is by far one of the best swans i
56:49 - definitely i think i've seen
56:52 - okay clean clean clean
56:55 - good good good yeah
56:59 - yeah it's easy to read i'll give this a
57:01 - 10 out of 10 for sure
57:03 - okay sick um for more would you give it
57:07 - yeah for me this one is gonna be an
57:09 - eight out of ten
57:11 - okay why so uh why is cause again i
57:14 - think
57:15 - the map should not really take up
57:19 - all of that real estate because these
57:21 - graphs are freaking awesome and the
57:23 - table is awesome i wish the table and
57:25 - the graphs
57:27 - were like right smack in the middle like
57:29 - how
57:30 - the initial app that you built nas so
57:33 - that you should
57:34 - so it's like that is important that
57:36 - those things be
57:38 - front and center because map is not
57:41 - super super useful
57:42 - to look at also the other thing
57:46 - that i think is um
57:49 - i don't like i want to have a table that
57:51 - i can sort
57:54 - and you can't store this one i can't top
57:56 - 10. yeah i can't sort this one i also
57:59 - wish that like i could sort it based on
58:00 - recovered
58:01 - that total debts all of that i also wish
58:04 - the countries next to
58:06 - next to it had um flags
58:10 - so in the table and um
58:15 - and yeah so those few additions again
58:18 - map i think just it's so good the app is
58:21 - this
58:21 - looks so good i just wish more of this
58:24 - stuff was front and center
58:25 - the map was like probably because if i'm
58:27 - on mobile right think about this
58:29 - if i'm on mobile it's going to be really
58:31 - hard to scroll past the map
58:33 - because you're going to hit your thumb
58:35 - on this and you're going to like
58:36 - keep on playing with the map instead of
58:40 - you know the those countries what you
58:42 - would do okay so here's the thing so on
58:44 - the map actually
58:45 - is in order for you to actually use the
58:47 - map you have to use two fingers
58:49 - so you know when you simply just
58:51 - scrolling it actually it won't scroll
58:52 - the map won't scroll
58:53 - unless you use two fingers got it okay
58:56 - yeah
58:57 - yeah but but yeah but i would i would
58:59 - still put the active cases and recover
59:01 - like these cards honestly even on mobile
59:04 - uh these cards i think might be better
59:07 - to put at the top
59:08 - like i would wanna personally yeah i
59:10 - would really like to see that so
59:12 - i think this app is really really good
59:14 - just those few touches
59:16 - like for me it um the functionality i
59:19 - think could be improved a tad bit other
59:21 - than that
59:22 - response like mobile or sorry um how
59:25 - good
59:25 - this app looks the design it's like one
59:27 - of the best
59:29 - yeah yeah very clear very clear all
59:32 - right let's keep going man
59:33 - let's keep going oh what's going on here
59:36 - john anthony babin
59:39 - oh interesting
59:44 - guys but wait if you guys want to check
59:46 - out these projects they are
59:48 - they are right here you can check them
59:50 - out right here i'll put a link right
59:52 - there
59:52 - so you guys just said oh dang
59:55 - i'm matt uh is it me or is it taking a
59:58 - really long time to
60:00 - load it's taking out some time to load
60:04 - either that or i don't know or something
60:06 - or something's going on
60:12 - okay yeah that yeah still a few few good
60:15 - yeah we still have
60:16 - took a really long time to load i felt
60:18 - like yeah
60:21 - okay great
60:24 - uh we got the tables let's go
60:27 - afghanistan
60:28 - nice so same thing with the table so the
60:31 - table is great
60:32 - just searching is like kind of hard to
60:34 - see that there is like
60:36 - this search here which is really small
60:39 - um let's go over the good things first
60:42 - so the great things that i love about
60:43 - this
60:44 - is i like how he went with the
60:47 - cases recovered and that's that looks
60:49 - pretty clean and even the
60:51 - emojis or icons that he used for them
60:54 - look nice the images yeah
60:56 - yeah i mean i like that though i don't i
60:58 - don't i don't like the how
61:00 - it has like that really like that green
61:01 - gradient yeah
61:03 - the gradient is like the gradient i'm
61:04 - not a big fan of that yeah
61:07 - i like i like flat colors and that
61:10 - that's actually very
61:11 - you know flat colors are are very much
61:13 - like in style right now
61:14 - so yeah i do like the fact that he has a
61:17 - hover
61:17 - and active state so when i click on
61:19 - deaths that does stay
61:20 - active yeah this is active too
61:24 - uh stats over time go ahead go ahead
61:27 - go ahead i'm just gonna say i like that
61:30 - the graph is
61:31 - right there front and center so i can
61:33 - take a look at the graph let me actually
61:34 - type in
61:36 - usa
61:39 - that table is really key okay
61:43 - i like that the graph changes right away
61:45 - as soon as i type in usa and it shows me
61:48 - cases and recovered at the same time so
61:50 - that's that's actually really useful
61:52 - because i can see the rate of recovery
61:54 - in cases in the same graph
61:57 - yeah somebody's like 8 out of 12.
62:01 - you know 12. so the number of sudden is
62:04 - 12
62:05 - i don't know how that happened but oh my
62:08 - bad it's
62:08 - supposed to be 150 go ahead yeah
62:11 - and i do i do love i do love how you
62:14 - incorporate
62:15 - um i think the case is recovering that
62:18 - could be at the top
62:22 - you know the map is not the most
62:23 - important thing right you want to see
62:25 - the numbers right away
62:26 - that is the most important thing right
62:27 - so you know um that could be better and
62:30 - i think that table below
62:32 - that table below um does not fit
62:35 - with all the other things that you got
62:37 - you're like the borders are eh
62:40 - you know so yeah i think it could have
62:43 - made that a little bit cleaner but
62:45 - you know nice job and just i like how
62:47 - you use the real estate which is really
62:49 - good so the whole real estate is is used
62:51 - up nicely
62:51 - by the way guys i just wanted to say
62:53 - thank you so much we are about to hit
62:55 - 10 000 views on this live stream as well
62:58 - that is
62:59 - crazy are you serious it's insane we're
63:01 - currently
63:02 - at 9 500 so guys if you guys want to

63:05 - through the 10 000 just please smash
63:07 - that like button like right now
63:09 - like smash that like button yeah it's
63:11 - just going to help spread this some more
63:13 - you know we're talking about covid we're
63:15 - not spreading covet we're just spreading
63:16 - the love of this
63:17 - app and so more people can actually view
63:19 - it do that that would
63:21 - mean the world to us thank you guys so
63:23 - much let's keep going
63:25 - appreciate it so this is cool let's get
63:28 - out of
63:29 - this app so i mean we want to give it a
63:32 - rating i think
63:33 - yeah i'll give it a 7. damn you went
63:37 - really hard um
63:39 - yeah i think um for me this one
63:43 - just because i got my tables and i can
63:45 - sort by them i
63:46 - love sorting by my tables and um
63:49 - i got the graph so functionality for me
63:51 - is great i think the front end could be
63:53 - improved so i think i'm going to give it
63:54 - a
63:55 - 8.2 just to be above a little
63:58 - eight so that would be mine on this
64:03 - okay damn we got lots to go right

64:23 - nice okay cool holy crap what is
64:26 - happening here
64:27 - okay oh okay that's a big image man
64:31 - you have to zoom in a lot of this one
64:33 - yeah the
64:34 - image is taking over my brain
64:38 - nice
64:40 - i don't like that i have to scroll
64:42 - horizontally on this
64:44 - um i like that there are commas in here
64:46 - but i don't like that i'm getting
64:48 - floating numbers like point zero
64:50 - uh-huh right yeah uh
64:54 - yeah even if you remove just those
64:55 - floating numbers you might be able to
64:57 - yeah i would stretch
64:58 - that a little bit more oh i don't know
65:01 - what is happening with this graph
65:03 - it's just so interesting this is not
65:05 - useful
65:06 - um so great but i think on
65:10 - i think on mine if this is a
65:14 - i would say a six out of ten yeah i was

66:01 - guys not good is it the next person this
66:04 - is the next person
66:05 - yeah so you're making me do too many
66:08 - things to fully visualize the graphs
66:10 - please rotate your phone and scroll down
66:12 - if you have problems scrolling the table
66:13 - try clicking on any of the four buttons
66:14 - first
66:15 - oh my god for all oh my god i was
66:18 - reading it right away i have
66:19 - directions on how to use your site
66:22 - period
66:23 - there should never be any directions on
66:24 - how to use a site because they
66:26 - because the usability of a site should
66:29 - be
66:30 - within the site itself they should never
66:32 - be in directions drop in the comments
66:34 - below if you agree with me on that
66:35 - and if you feel like the same the same
66:37 - on that right you should never have to
66:39 - guess or read how to use something it
66:41 - should just come naturally
66:42 - yeah that is um yeah
66:46 - so i would what the hell is all this
66:48 - black stuff at the bottom
66:50 - where i don't know
66:53 - i mean look you can see my screen like
66:56 - look there's like bunch of
66:57 - it's not it's literally like not what's
66:59 - been on
67:00 - yeah click on show graph what is the
67:02 - show graph what is that so
67:04 - it's so cool i mean i'm on imac but that
67:06 - should still not happen
67:08 - show graph um
67:12 - close close graph uh
67:15 - show table hey here's my table let's go
67:21 - man you love the tables man uh this app
67:24 - is too weird to use
67:25 - like it got too creative for me i don't
67:27 - know i'm
67:30 - oh my god oh my god this is too creative
67:33 - for me
67:35 - i'm gonna have to give this a 5.5 out of
67:37 - 10. i'm out
67:39 - yeah i'll give it a 6 out of 10. i get a
67:41 - 6 out of 10. but you know for somebody

67:45 - you know i know albert alvarez is
67:46 - actually one of those success coaches
67:48 - a lot of these people like are really
67:50 - beginners with coding right and this is
67:51 - their first time trying
67:53 - to try now something like this so right
67:54 - even that no no i'm being
67:56 - i'm being um awful just for like the
67:59 - dramatic impact kind of like how
68:01 - simon cowell is you know you know uh
68:04 - what is that show america's got talent
68:06 - but no seriously like
68:08 - it's it's freaking insane guys like the
68:10 - functionality you have to add to make
68:12 - this work is
68:13 - actually crazy we're just for
68:15 - entertainment purposes you know
68:16 - sometimes playing the good cop the bad
68:18 - cop so don't take it to heart we love

68:49 - worry
68:50 - saba
68:53 - ah okay
68:57 - um i would prefer okay i like that it's
69:00 - taking up the full screen let's go 150
69:02 - nice i can see everything visually in
69:06 - one place
69:07 - i would prefer country flags
69:10 - next to it um i can't change between
69:14 - recovered
69:15 - cadets and all that i can't click or
69:17 - wait
69:18 - is it just loading or what's happening
69:22 - okay i don't think so they don't even
69:25 - look like buttons guys when i hover over
69:27 - it i
69:27 - like it doesn't even look like i should
69:28 - be able to click on it but
69:30 - when i click on it it works so front end
69:33 - wise it's pretty
69:34 - low like i would not give it that high
69:38 - of a score
69:39 - let's go albania it's fast though
69:43 - is it mobile friendly just mobile
69:45 - friendliness i mean
69:46 - it's the same as what the other ones are
69:48 - so is it more friendly just check that
69:50 - no it's not oh it's not okay i'll give
69:55 - this a 5 out of 10.
69:56 - holy crap so yeah so 6 out of 10 for me
70:00 - great good job but the reason why you
70:02 - didn't get extra points is because
70:04 - it's um doesn't also have and like
70:07 - you didn't really innovate a lot of
70:09 - things on top of it but overall it looks
70:12 - good it has like bunch of functionality
70:15 - come on man you could have just made it
70:17 - mobile friendly you know
70:19 - mumble friendly and just you know
70:20 - already it would have been a few more
70:22 - points but
70:23 - yes friendly guys is key yeah mobile
70:26 - friendly is really important because
70:27 - most of the people are even going to be
70:28 - using it
70:29 - on mobile oh man
70:32 - we're about to get to some exciting
70:34 - stuff guys we just broke
70:36 - 10 000 views thank you so much this is
70:39 - freaking awesome i am pumped about that

73:01 - clever amman amanda says clever
73:03 - programmer as simon cowell nas domonsky
73:05 - has david
73:06 - uh williams and dev's got talent
73:10 - let's go it couldn't load
73:14 - oh no no devs yeah this should be like a
73:18 - dev's got talent so i like what he did
73:21 - on the innovation of like
73:22 - the recovered worst versus the
73:26 - um live cases you know that kind of
73:30 - that's kind of cool and i can hover over
73:33 - uh
73:34 - yeah all right that's alright and
73:37 - there's no charge
73:38 - it's not just google maps doesn't work
73:40 - but there's also no graph so i can't see
73:42 - growth rates and things like that
73:44 - so this one is going to be a 5 out of
73:46 - 10.
73:47 - yeah sorry but but pretty cool pretty
73:50 - cool try and design yeah
73:52 - should we should we have prizes for like
73:55 - the worst
73:55 - place or is that too mean
74:00 - do you guys think we should have prizes
74:01 - for like the worst place um
74:03 - or just no like you can just tell us no
74:05 - you know that could be a horrible idea
74:08 - in worst place in the first place and
74:12 - the worst place
74:17 - that's hilarious that's andrea i think
74:19 - right andrea
74:22 - yeah somebody said um ashken says kazi
74:25 - honestly your course has helped me a lot
74:26 - and
74:27 - it is worth far more than what you guys
74:29 - charge for it thank you so much
74:31 - i appreciate appreciate that we put a
74:33 - lot of love into that this project
74:36 - was made in the profit with javascript
74:38 - course and should be submitted already
74:40 - that's what yvette just said
74:42 - oh yeah yeah because she's like somebody
74:43 - asked how can i submit their
74:45 - code project um okay so guys
74:48 - if you're catching me some of these i
74:50 - might be like a little brutal just don't
74:51 - take offense i'm just
74:53 - because i'm just going through this fast
74:54 - now uh yeah
74:56 - looking great but just for some reason
74:59 - the
74:59 - style of it like i don't know it looks
75:02 - like one of those like 1999 like html
75:05 - websites you know like
75:07 - freaks me out to look at it like i don't
75:09 - know why there are three exclamation
75:10 - marks saying today's cases like
75:13 - feel like my dad is yelling at me
75:17 - so so guys what you want to avoid is you
75:19 - want to avoid like wide shadows like
75:21 - those white shadows
75:23 - even if you simply just remove the white
75:24 - shadows and you kept just a very
75:26 - simple kind of like nice border like a
75:29 - nice curved
75:30 - uh design and very flat without the
75:32 - white shadows it went a lot better right
75:34 - away
75:35 - so try shadow shadows in general are
75:38 - already like
75:38 - very much non-style guys literally just
75:41 - i mean
75:42 - try to avoid it like as much as you can
75:44 - unless you know
75:45 - you have it you have like a hover state
75:46 - or something okay
75:48 - mobile friendliness i mean mobile
75:50 - friendliness is actually pretty
75:52 - damn good not gonna lie great job on
75:54 - mobile friendliness
75:55 - seriously like what um
75:58 - yeah so yeah andrea andrea nice job
76:02 - but yeah i think i think the design
76:03 - could have been a little bit better i
76:05 - mean
76:06 - i do i do okay besides my yelling at the
76:10 - design
76:11 - i like that like the table my table is
76:14 - there
76:15 - i don't like that it's not not sortable
76:19 - i also don't like that
76:22 - that i can't click on it and then it
76:24 - picks those countries
76:25 - so let's actually go ahead and pick usa
76:28 - so search functionality is great
76:31 - nice i don't know what happens on the
76:32 - map there it's a little aggressive but i
76:35 - like that i can see the
76:36 - total cases today active and all that
76:40 - yeah um so so let's let's give it a
76:43 - score and let's let's keep going can we
76:45 - still have a few
76:46 - man i i seven point nine
76:50 - okay i'll give it a i'll give it a seven
76:52 - i'll give it a seven
76:54 - seven okay so who was this andrea right
76:58 - like honestly just the fact that it's
77:00 - usable functionality
77:02 - and then it's mobile friendly that alone
77:05 - already
77:06 - gives it a really decent score you know
77:09 - and then like
77:10 - honestly it could have been the ugliest
77:11 - thing on the planet but like if it has
77:13 - usefulness then that's really good like
77:16 - yeah
77:19 - okay some really creative ones we're
77:22 - about to look at
77:23 - man i'm excited to get to the david one
77:25 - man i can't wait to get rid of all right
77:27 - like i'm dying like that one oh like
77:31 - all right all right let's keep going
77:32 - through this
77:39 - let's see so okay
77:42 - okay cool cool cool cool so
77:48 - let's take a look holy crap
77:51 - that's kind of i kind of like how like
77:54 - kind of pops out like that's kind of
77:55 - nice
77:57 - oh man why are you hiding your tables
77:59 - and stuff why are they hidden
78:00 - they should have been like at the top
78:02 - nice job on them but
78:04 - there should be more holy big
78:06 - tables i can't sort them
78:09 - they should have flags next to them um
78:12 - so they look nice but i think the
78:14 - functionality on it is a little low
78:16 - just because i can't hey there's no
78:18 - search functionality
78:24 - there's no search functionality on this
78:28 - so um i think
78:32 - just because there's no search
78:33 - functionality that alone drops the
78:35 - functionality like crazy of this app
78:37 - so i'm gonna have to give this app a
78:42 - uh a 5 out of 10 unfortunately
78:47 - yeah i would say i don't okay one thing
78:50 - i don't like is like the centered
78:51 - countries like don't try to center that
78:54 - kind of stuff you know
78:55 - yeah that's just that does not look good
78:58 - and
78:58 - it feels a little bit like incohesive
79:01 - like you know you have the top map
79:02 - with you know which with those tabs
79:05 - which is awesome
79:06 - right search functionality is not there
79:08 - but as you go
79:09 - down it just kind of feels discontinued
79:11 - like disconnected you know very
79:13 - different style and everything so yeah i
79:16 - think definitely could have been
79:17 - improved there
79:17 - um on that style so yeah yeah
79:21 - so i would definitely do that okay but
79:23 - nice job other than that
79:24 - great job making the clone of the covid
79:27 - just
79:28 - yeah i those few things i would
79:31 - definitely improve them 6 out of 10 for
79:33 - me let's keep it moving
79:35 - on jonty briggs i don't know about this
79:38 - one this one is throwing me off
79:40 - let me see so go um
79:44 - so i mean yeah it's uh i don't know
79:46 - what's going on here that doesn't look
79:48 - right
79:48 - oh everything's at 10 and now it changed
79:52 - holy crap my computer's about to crash
79:56 - this has gotten way too fast the map is
79:59 - so huge that it's like
80:03 - like i would run away from this app
80:06 - and yeah um yeah so overall i mean
80:10 - let me actually okay so first of all
80:12 - search functionality
80:13 - great job on this when i click usa
80:15 - everything changes to usa
80:18 - nice i feel like too much is going on in
80:20 - terms of like
80:21 - why i don't know why everybody's going
80:23 - so crazy over the map the map is like
80:25 - too much
80:26 - you can make the map really tiny and it
80:28 - will still look clean
80:30 - yeah and the whole and transparency guys
80:33 - guys please avoid that to the your
80:36 - livelihood
80:37 - yeah like
80:40 - oh my god why transparency i think i
80:44 - have to stop looking at everything for a
80:46 - little bit
80:49 - so yeah i think you know the your
80:52 - thinking behind it was you know good you
80:54 - wanted to have the map really cool and
80:55 - what are you doing is this what you're
80:57 - teaching them to make in this course
81:01 - listen listen i said be creative as you
81:04 - can okay
81:06 - so okay um
81:10 - if i speak like a consumer not like a
81:12 - developer as a consumer
81:14 - i'd be like ugh like i feel like i'm on
81:15 - like 1999 html website right when html
81:19 - and stuff was getting developed
81:21 - so that's kind of what i would say from
81:23 - a developer perspective look
81:25 - functionality is great it's useful
81:28 - i can search up countries it shows me
81:30 - them i would get rid of the map or just
81:33 - make it really tiny
81:35 - the tables would need to be prettier the
81:37 - tables don't look pretty
81:39 - and i would get rid of all transparency
81:42 - this thing doesn't even look like it has
81:44 - it can scroll
81:46 - and just adding graphs on top of
81:48 - everything else
81:49 - makes it just too much going on but
81:52 - again if you're new and you built this
81:54 - i mean you're a rock star so nice job
81:57 - but
81:57 - in terms of the actual app i'm going to
81:59 - give it a 6 out of 10 and
82:01 - what makes me give it a 6 and not a 5 is
82:04 - because at least all the functionality
82:05 - is there
82:07 - yeah i'll give it a 6 as well okay this
82:10 - is
82:10 - jaunty jaunty
82:15 - daunty okay awesome
82:18 - all right here we go now we got david
82:20 - riccosi
82:22 - hey let's go david dave are you in the
82:24 - house
82:25 - david let us know if you're not he's
82:26 - he's running the live coaching call
82:28 - for profit with javascript
82:33 - elijah is like that website was too loud
82:35 - for him to handle yeah
82:38 - okay let's see here man
82:42 - i love your tables um
82:46 - that effect is slightly weird just
82:49 - because like it makes everything go
82:50 - invisible like
82:52 - just maybe like a little bit more subtle
82:56 - not not so it blends into the background
82:59 - but i love your color choices like where
83:02 - it says 4.47
83:04 - million um also i would like it
83:08 - go ahead what that will improve is the
83:11 - numbers
83:11 - they're not aligned they're all all over
83:14 - the place
83:15 - oh yeah what the hell i did not notice
83:18 - that at all
83:19 - yeah so keep your numbers aligned that's
83:21 - part one and make them a little bit
83:23 - bigger because that's like one of the
83:24 - biggest things that you know that
83:26 - is telling that people are going to be
83:28 - looking for so make that a little bit
83:30 - more bigger
83:31 - hey it's like dancing numbers oh
83:34 - i know right
83:39 - what is that song dance monkey up and
83:42 - down and up and down and up and down
83:45 - yeah i don't know about those dancing
83:47 - numbers look i love the dark
83:49 - theme i love the design i like how
83:51 - you're using orange and purple
83:53 - i even love how your table is
83:56 - just the dancing numbers really throw a
83:59 - person off
84:01 - um it's your functionality i mean
84:04 - it looks like if i type in usa it should
84:07 - do it live but it doesn't and i have to
84:11 - it's not intuitive that i have to
84:12 - actually hit enter
84:14 - or does it i mean it doesn't search does
84:18 - it i don't i don't think it works at all
84:20 - oh man i'm taking away all the points
84:23 - for that
84:24 - also what did you do david you had such
84:28 - a great chance to win
84:30 - this what the hell so here it should
84:32 - actually say
84:33 - active cases or something at the top
84:35 - because what is this thirty two thousand
84:37 - thirty two thousand why i know it is is
84:39 - it thirty two thousand
84:40 - like active cases um 32 000
84:44 - friends i don't know what that number
84:47 - is 32 000 friends
84:51 - 32 000 subscribers
84:54 - subscribe to the channel on that note
84:57 - guys let's go
85:01 - so
85:05 - it's lagging huh it's all good it's all
85:06 - good so
85:08 - yeah i would so that i like how the
85:11 - i like your logos with infected and
85:14 - deaths and all of this
85:15 - there's something about it that just
85:18 - it's
85:18 - very very close to actually really you
85:21 - click on that button
85:23 - recover no the right button right hand
85:26 - side like
85:27 - there's a right arrow button you see
85:29 - that oh i don't even see those
85:30 - oh wow i didn't even know that was there
85:33 - yeah
85:33 - pretty cool um so okay cool
85:37 - i can refresh i don't know what that's
85:40 - for
85:41 - but okay reset okay um
85:44 - okay so that's cool that i could click
85:46 - that button i like
85:48 - how you use these debts and infected
85:50 - icons
85:51 - great job on that those are clean very
85:54 - very very distinct
85:55 - visually so good job on that um
85:59 - another thing is it is very close to one
86:03 - of those like super
86:04 - modern website designs like it looks
86:06 - almost really good
86:07 - there's just certain things give it away
86:09 - i don't know noz can maybe tell you but
86:11 - like
86:12 - when i hover over this there's that
86:14 - little box
86:15 - that's behind it but that box looks like
86:17 - it's too tight maybe if that box was
86:20 - you know a little bigger i think
86:23 - yeah i think i mean it's fine if you
86:26 - want like on the hover but like i think
86:28 - in terms of user experience right for
86:31 - example there's 148
86:32 - 883 i'm not sure what that means like
86:36 - does that mean that new cases new
86:37 - infected
86:38 - or what yeah i mean like like i don't
86:41 - know like if you even if you just simply
86:43 - added a
86:43 - plus in there just a plus 148 right that
86:46 - right away tells me that is
86:48 - plus new numbers or something like that
86:50 - so
86:51 - always think about not just the ui guys
86:53 - but user experience
86:54 - very important yeah and i know you guys
86:56 - you know and if you guys want to you
86:57 - know
86:58 - you know obviously if you guys didn't
87:00 - know right but the way to get to kaz's
87:02 - heart is like literally just you know
87:03 - have a dark theme right so
87:08 - yeah elijah says i think if this site
87:11 - was more polished it would be a great
87:14 - contender for top three
87:16 - now steve i know what you're saying the
87:18 - refresh obviously he goes
87:20 - it obviously pulls the latest stats from
87:22 - the api i don't think that's actually
87:24 - obvious at all and especially to the
87:27 - user
87:28 - they have no idea what you're doing by
87:31 - hitting that refresh so i
87:35 - really wouldn't say that yeah it's not
87:37 - too obvious to me
87:39 - and if it's obviously developers that's
87:41 - okay but again it's end users that are
87:43 - going to be using it at the end of the
87:44 - day so i think
87:45 - that just needs to be a little bit
87:46 - better uh in that regard
87:49 - so for me i would not like
87:52 - even look this graph is like hidden and
87:54 - i don't know why
87:56 - could you have found a graph that had
87:58 - more lines like holy
88:00 - crap like why does it have
88:03 - so many lines in the back i can't even
88:05 - see
88:06 - and it looks like right before this call
88:09 - oh
88:10 - i have to actually look at hot yeah not
88:12 - mobile friendly
88:13 - and it feels like david right beforehand
88:16 - manually with his hands drew this red
88:18 - freaking
88:19 - mark with the marker so like
88:22 - it didn't look like he's pulling from
88:24 - real data this is like david got one
88:28 - um so it's a pretty app but i wouldn't
88:33 - use it ever um
88:36 - and so because of that
88:39 - it like design
88:42 - wise it's really beautiful i would like
88:45 - design was i would almost give it like a
88:46 - 8.5
88:47 - they're just some design things that are
88:49 - broken but
88:50 - functionality wise it's sitting at a
88:52 - five so for me
88:54 - i'm gonna give it a six yeah i'll give
88:57 - it a seven i'll give it a seven
88:59 - but yeah david user user experience
89:02 - first yes and function yeah user
89:05 - experience and for a person like me
89:08 - some functionality first if i'm coming
89:09 - to the app to learn about covet stats i
89:12 - want to know in
89:13 - simple ways what i'm looking at yeah
89:16 - let's look at
89:17 - what the next app is looks like
89:20 - okay let's check it out interesting
89:27 - okay
89:33 - graph is unreadable awesome okay john
89:36 - anthony is actually on the chat
89:38 - so clean okay let's see what's happening
89:42 - here
89:42 - let's see who's our next victim
89:46 - yo i like what he's doing here on the
89:50 - navigation
89:51 - fancy navigation on the left hand side
89:53 - you know what i'm saying
89:55 - nice i can click it and it goes to a
89:57 - whole different page yo
89:58 - okay cool all right look at that
90:03 - okay let's go back to the dashboard here
90:08 - i like that okay so i like how front and
90:10 - center everything is and it's
90:12 - very obvious for me to how to use it so
90:14 - if i go
90:16 - let's go usa nice
90:19 - i get my infected right there recover
90:21 - that's great
90:23 - now on the right hand side
90:26 - can i sort this i can't sort this can i
90:28 - click
90:29 - i can't click so that's sorted at all
90:33 - yeah yeah so that should be sorted top
90:35 - cases per region that's pretty cool
90:38 - you got it based on oh that's that's
90:40 - actually a nice
90:41 - way to put it for me to go oh crap north
90:44 - america is like screwed
90:46 - south america and then asia and europe
90:49 - and africa like
90:51 - actually it's kind of nice to see how
90:54 - screwed everybody is
90:55 - in a descending order of screwedness
90:59 - except that's true it looks like
91:00 - australia is killing it dang look at
91:01 - that
91:03 - australia is like i think it's just one
91:05 - of my friends that probably has it but
91:06 - outside of that everybody's looking
91:08 - great
91:09 - um global daily cases okay that looks
91:13 - good too
91:14 - i mean okay functionality wise this is
91:17 - as a user i am looking for this
91:20 - i like that you actually even thought
91:22 - about
91:24 - call to action that's actually like
91:26 - advanced and we probably didn't even
91:27 - talk about this but like
91:29 - the fact that you have some kind of call
91:30 - to action because like look what can
91:32 - people do to help
91:33 - and you already thought about that on
91:34 - donation i think that's actually pretty
91:37 - smart because most people who are coming
91:39 - here
91:41 - are looking at how screwed up the world
91:43 - is and then want to find a way to help
91:45 - so i actually really really like that
91:48 - you gave this website a direction
91:49 - because again guys at the end of the day
91:51 - what really matters is is your website
91:53 - either making sales
91:54 - or is your website helping change the
91:58 - world some kind of call to action
91:59 - somehow
92:01 - so uh for me and then it's like
92:05 - looks great on the screen and then let's
92:07 - take a look at mobile friendliness
92:08 - please don't screw up here uh it's a
92:10 - little screwed up
92:12 - oh nice nice it even changes at the top
92:17 - yeah man did you actually
92:20 - did you see something so actually i'll
92:22 - go into big screen go with the bigger
92:24 - screen
92:24 - check this out so you see look at the
92:26 - recovery rate so
92:27 - as you hover over hover over the you
92:30 - know hover over the infected
92:32 - uh-huh you can see the recovery rate
92:34 - that it creates like
92:35 - that shadow you see that check this out
92:37 - no no no no
92:38 - no uh hover over the a country infected
92:41 - number
92:42 - i'm being stupid hold on okay hover over
92:45 - the country infected number okay i'm
92:47 - hovering over here
92:48 - look at the recovery rate
92:52 - um do you see that
92:55 - that circle the green circle i think
92:57 - that so i think that circle is happening
92:59 - regardless of anything at random times
93:03 - no or is it but
93:06 - yeah i think it's random bro like
93:08 - because what what does that 62 percent
93:10 - mean
93:10 - oh i sure don't know my birthday's right
93:12 - up yeah damn he tricked you he got you
93:14 - oh look at that but uh let me see
93:17 - actually what the donate
93:19 - looks like if it's still donate
93:22 - man i gotta say that the innovation on
93:26 - this the mobile friendliness on this the
93:28 - usefulness i mean granted it doesn't
93:31 - have my sorted
93:32 - functionality that i crave but like even
93:35 - this graph
93:36 - is very useful to actually look at i
93:38 - feel like
93:40 - i don't know i feel like i would have to
93:41 - give this a 8.9
93:43 - in my eyes yeah i'll give it a nine i'll
93:46 - give it a nine
93:48 - who is this top three
93:52 - elijah says top three contender uh
93:55 - 9.5 for this one elijah i really like
93:58 - this one
94:00 - yeah yeah okay cool muhammad says
94:04 - eight what's all says nine
94:07 - wow this is this is great movies is
94:10 - actually one of our uh
94:12 - mauis is one of our success coaches yeah
94:15 - yes he is great guy guys great guy
94:20 - okay how many okay we got a few left
94:22 - okay guys
94:23 - so great job guys so far we've been
94:26 - going at it hard
94:28 - let's keep the energy high so what i
94:30 - want you guys to do is just
94:32 - drop in the chat below how you guys are
94:35 - enjoying this so far
94:36 - let's keep that energy up and honestly
94:38 - if you feel like you need to stand up
94:40 - stand up look at the squad leader and i
94:43 - think it looks like mario
94:44 - so like stand up a little bit and just
94:47 - make sure that you're feeling
94:49 - you know attentive you're relaxed if you
94:51 - need to go grab water or something
94:53 - i got perrier with me you know get
94:55 - something with you because
94:57 - this retention is going to be important
94:58 - for your front end design skills
95:00 - like today what you're learning might
95:01 - actually be able to get you a job
95:03 - tomorrow
95:04 - so stay with us keep the energy high
95:08 - like the video if you haven't already
95:10 - other than that now you got something to
95:11 - say before we just get back to it
95:13 - let's get back to it guys let's get back
95:15 - to it let's get let's get to it
95:17 - all right so let's go and take a look at
95:20 - carlos
95:20 - serrano oh no no no
95:23 - yuga you gurang all right
95:27 - jake says been standing the whole time
95:29 - abdullah says let's dance nas
95:32 - let's go oh all right oh
95:35 - all right let's keep going
95:38 - who what am i clicking on what did i do
95:41 - live
95:45 - all right here we go
95:48 - okay that's a little creepy image of
95:52 - somebody with an underwear on their eyes
95:56 - that i think that i think they're meant
95:59 - to be like a like uh
96:01 - that looks like underwear on my eye it
96:04 - looks like i'm wearing somebody's
96:05 - wearing an underwear
96:07 - where their nose should have been and
96:08 - they don't even have a nose
96:11 - so first who doesn't wear underwear on
96:13 - their eyes
96:14 - first of all first of all it's also not
96:16 - teaching me how to use the mask
96:17 - correctly it's actually teaching me i
96:19 - should put my mask above my mouth
96:21 - so all right anyways let's take a look
96:25 - at what's actually going on here let's
96:26 - click on recovered
96:28 - nice it changes to that let's click on
96:31 - dats
96:32 - seems like it changes to that okay
96:36 - let's go back to total cases covid 19
96:39 - tracker i like that little virus icon
96:41 - kind of moving up and down
96:43 - uh at the top guys ease up on the
96:46 - animations
96:47 - um and jiff images and all of that just
96:50 - because it slows down your website
96:53 - yeah your animations guys when you do
96:55 - actually do animation
96:56 - here's a here's a really key part listen
96:58 - to this yo what is this why can't i
97:00 - so what is why can i look up multiple
97:04 - countries and stuff you know what i mean
97:05 - like what is that about what does that
97:07 - mean
97:07 - what do you mean what do you mean oh
97:10 - this is probably done wrong
97:13 - yeah you know what i'm saying like yeah
97:16 - that's not right
97:16 - and it feels like nothing is changing
97:19 - unless
97:20 - then it zooms in it zooms into the usa
97:23 - so like if you type in usable zoom into
97:24 - there
97:28 - wait hold on what
97:31 - what gilbert says love your channel
97:33 - quasi love the fact that you make real
97:34 - world projects that a person can add to
97:36 - their portfolio okay cool
97:38 - uh thank you by the way i appreciate
97:40 - that
97:41 - clever programmer simon call yeah so
97:44 - i don't like the fact that those things
97:47 - add on and they don't do anything
97:48 - i thought it would like combine the
97:50 - stats of brazil and usa
97:52 - so that's not good i like that you have
97:55 - flags and everything
97:56 - so that's cool the functionality is a
97:59 - little broken
98:00 - just a little bit not too much but a
98:02 - little broken
98:03 - still just a little broken yeah
98:07 - these graphs don't look good at all at
98:10 - the bottom left i would do something to
98:12 - make them look good
98:13 - man we are hardcore we are hardcore man
98:16 - with our
98:20 - dave's got town literally um
98:24 - i think i think i think here's what i
98:26 - think i think that
98:28 - um for one the transition is a bit too
98:30 - slow so the transitions for example
98:32 - you know when you when you hover
98:33 - transitions can definitely be
98:35 - better right you guys want to keep your
98:37 - transitions and here's the key thing
98:39 - you want to keep your transitions to 0.2
98:41 - seconds to 0.3 seconds max
98:45 - doing this in code maximum is 0.3
98:49 - seconds guys
98:51 - ah i see okay that's the key that's a
98:53 - key factor
98:54 - got it this this would be really
98:58 - hard to use on a mobile device just
99:01 - because the countries when you type them
99:03 - in they start to stack
99:04 - on and that's a pretty confusing user
99:07 - experience
99:08 - so overall mobile friendliness is great
99:11 - i would give mobile friendliness a 10
99:13 - out of 10 on this
99:14 - good job on the mobile friendliness the
99:18 - the app functionality is pretty good
99:21 - just it lacks a little bit on the user
99:23 - experience and then also the design the
99:25 - front end design of it i would give it
99:27 - like a seven
99:28 - out of ten so with all of those
99:31 - combined for me this is a seven
99:34 - yeah i'll get a seven as well actually
99:36 - yeah yeah
99:38 - yeah i do like all the things that you
99:40 - put on that you put on news right i mean
99:41 - this is the reason
99:43 - the only reason i would lower it from an
99:45 - eight to a seven is just because
99:47 - even though it has the same
99:49 - functionality as the apps i gave
99:51 - and ate it actually has a poorer
99:55 - user experience simply because this
99:58 - starts to stack on
99:59 - and then it's confusing what that
100:01 - actually does yeah yeah
100:03 - yeah yeah that's it simple fix but but
100:06 - yeah guys
100:08 - okay so now we got carlos serrano
100:11 - carlos is in profitable shortcut too
100:13 - right
100:14 - i think so uh
100:18 - let's take a look at this okay cool
100:21 - so all right all right i
100:24 - kind of feel like leaving the website
100:26 - already just because it's too
100:27 - dark so if you're gonna keep it
100:29 - something just keep them white it makes
100:31 - me feel lighter
100:32 - even though i like dark mode but i feel
100:34 - like you gotta then do dark mode
100:36 - right because if you don't do it right
100:38 - then you got consequences where people
100:40 - just feel unhappy and like
100:42 - like you're trying to suffocate me and i
100:43 - want to leave right away
100:46 - like this is this is like a you know
100:48 - like like a like a
100:51 - cave you know you go into a cave yeah
100:55 - you know but yeah no i think guys
100:57 - whenever you do this kind of stuff like
100:59 - you have to use very nice like when you
101:01 - if you're doing dark mode
101:02 - grays are very important here you know
101:05 - and what i i think another big thing is
101:07 - like for example
101:09 - the the countries cases is not sorted
101:12 - right so it's not sort of just says
101:13 - afghanistan the top um
101:16 - you know map i do i do got to say a few
101:18 - things i really like
101:20 - is the color scheme which you were
101:21 - talking about earlier nas
101:23 - like yellow the bed recovered
101:26 - uh 89 000 the heart i mean 89 000 is
101:29 - what's recovered so i like that it's
101:32 - blue
101:32 - i mean i if you're gonna make it blue
101:35 - then make also this stuff blue so then
101:37 - it matches everywhere
101:39 - and i like that he's actually using it
101:42 - these uh
101:43 - icons correctly too you know i like the
101:45 - good use of icons
101:47 - yeah but if you click if you click on
101:49 - the actual uh
101:51 - items like the map color does not
101:53 - correlate with the color
101:55 - of the tab yeah yeah i know i know
101:57 - that's what i was saying
101:58 - it's not the same yeah yellow is like
102:00 - blue here and the blue one
102:02 - is like green yeah but you know so
102:05 - that's good
102:05 - and then here i have to like sort it
102:09 - uh or it's not sorted let's take a look
102:12 - at
102:12 - mobile view
102:15 - so i mean mobile responsiveness is solid
102:19 - mobile response is 10 out of 10.
102:22 - functionality let's check like
102:24 - functionality
102:25 - so functionality is there
102:28 - nice um so great so functionality
102:32 - is solid functionality is good i would
102:34 - give functionality like a 8.5
102:37 - i would give the user experience a
102:41 - you know uh 8.5 the front end design of
102:45 - this though is really weak i would give
102:46 - the front end design a five
102:48 - so for me this would be at a 7.5
102:52 - yeah yeah i'll give this a 7 actually i
102:54 - give this is seven
102:56 - seven yeah yeah carlos
102:59 - design could be a little bit that design
103:02 - you know again too dark of a design
103:04 - um those those the map is a bit too big
103:08 - right that's not the most important
103:09 - thing when people like you always guys
103:11 - when you think about application always
103:14 - think about what is the
103:15 - main thing that people are going to be
103:17 - doing right
103:18 - the biggest thing on the app is going to
103:20 - be the first thing that people see
103:23 - right so always keep that in mind yeah
103:25 - people are saying it's too
103:26 - dark um yeah steve is saying scroll bars
103:30 - ah so he didn't like it
103:34 - okay cool let's take a look at this one
103:36 - hey at least this is centered
103:40 - so nice okay cool
103:43 - so let's take a look at this so the
103:45 - world is spinning but just remember that
103:47 - it's costing you probably you know the
103:49 - speed of the website maybe
103:53 - or maybe maybe i'm wrong yeah um
103:56 - okay so let's take a look at debts and
103:58 - all of this so i'm just
104:00 - in the start i'm kind of just like
104:01 - looking for functionality
104:03 - so okay nice functionality's there
104:09 - the charts are looking good graphs are
104:11 - there
104:12 - um okay
104:15 - and then countries are there so that's
104:18 - great
104:20 - what i the only things i don't like
104:21 - about it is um
104:23 - i even like the fact that you have
104:25 - testing for coronavirus here i
104:27 - any time you guys put a solid call to
104:29 - action type of thing
104:31 - i think is a huge plus because your
104:33 - website's
104:34 - purpose guys if i can get this through
104:38 - your head it will make you
104:39 - a really really not only an amazing
104:42 - developer but an amazing asset to
104:44 - anybody's team
104:45 - your website should serve a purpose
104:48 - i think it's great that your website can
104:50 - inform people about stats i think that's
104:52 - great too
104:54 - but i think if you put you want to take
104:56 - it one more
104:57 - next level above that is give it
105:00 - make it give people a direction so yeah
105:03 - if you're looking up coronavirus stuff
105:05 - maybe you're thinking about donation so
105:07 - that's one
105:08 - good call to action i would put or
105:11 - you want to get tested for coronavirus
105:14 - so that would be another one so
105:16 - helping people take some kind of action
105:18 - from the data they're looking at
105:20 - is a very very powerful thing you can do
105:24 - yeah i'd agree with that i would agree
105:25 - with that yeah and
105:27 - i do when i saw the quran testing i
105:29 - thought that was really interesting
105:29 - because that right away takes you to
105:32 - google.com and that really takes you to
105:34 - like you know covet or
105:35 - covet testing centers for me so yeah
105:38 - very nice
105:39 - very nice so overall what would you give
105:42 - this nas
105:43 - i'll give this i'll give this an eight
105:46 - it's
105:46 - um would i like this here's what like
105:48 - here's what i like i like the simplicity
105:50 - of it like it's yes
105:51 - it's true easy to look at and yeah you
105:53 - know pretty simple
105:55 - yeah yeah though though for example
105:57 - right
105:58 - the map spinning map you don't really
105:59 - need that um um
106:01 - the cases are not for example are not
106:04 - sorted
106:04 - right so in the table right it's not
106:06 - sorted um everything else is is
106:08 - pretty usable other than that but you
106:10 - know those two things and then oh
106:12 - uh also um the blue background
106:17 - not a big fan yeah another kind of the
106:20 - blue background
106:21 - you know you kind of want to avoid those
106:22 - kind of backgrounds and makes
106:24 - applications look very kind of old
106:26 - stylish
106:27 - old stuff that's why somebody said uh
106:29 - amanatsa amana
106:30 - said this one seriously looks like an
106:32 - early 2000 design
106:35 - yeah that's that's kind of what gives it
106:37 - that look but i mean i got a second you
106:39 - i mean
106:40 - keep going finish your finish your
106:42 - rating and then i'll
106:43 - say mine well yeah i know i think that
106:46 - that was pretty much it like honestly
106:47 - like
106:48 - great job you know but you know make
106:50 - yours not 2000s but you know 2020.
106:54 - you know so what would you rate it i'll
106:57 - rate this
106:57 - i'll write this um i'll give it a 7.5
107:01 - okay cool what the hell you said you i
107:04 - think you gave it an eight
107:05 - and now you change yeah
107:11 - so okay good so i think on my end
107:15 - what i like about it is the simplicity
107:17 - so functionality wise i mean
107:19 - most of the functionality is there so
107:20 - functionality wise it's like a 8.5 out
107:23 - of 10.
107:24 - it doesn't have sorting it doesn't have
107:26 - like
107:28 - um it doesn't say above the like what it
107:31 - like you know
107:32 - it should have more maybe even
107:33 - information in the tables like recovered
107:35 - or deaths
107:37 - so that is lacking
107:40 - i like the search functionality works
107:43 - effectively so that
107:45 - design wise i even like it because it's
107:47 - so simple
107:48 - and usable so that's good i just don't
107:51 - like the blue background
107:52 - that could be improved let's take a look
107:55 - at mobile friendliness mobile
107:56 - friendliness
107:57 - is pretty much a good ten so great job
108:00 - on mobile friendliness
108:01 - yeah and um and then you got some call
108:04 - to actions there too
108:06 - so for me it's gonna be and you know
108:09 - granted the front end design is lacking
108:10 - it's probably six or seven out of ten
108:13 - for me overall the app is eight got it
108:16 - cool coco
108:18 - okay cool yeah let's keep going guys
108:21 - so guys what do you think in the
108:22 - comments below what do you guys think
108:24 - how much
108:24 - dropped so we had people saying five we
108:26 - had people saying 6.5 yeah that makes
108:28 - sense
108:30 - animated globe is overkill yep i would
108:32 - agree i would take out the animated
108:34 - globe it's too much
108:35 - steve doesn't like the blue background
108:39 - yep
108:42 - yeah yeah our ratings are gonna change
108:44 - you guys they're not going to be perfect
108:46 - looking this is our first time actually
108:48 - doing this developers got talent dude we
108:50 - should actually call it developers got
108:52 - talent literally
108:53 - honestly we should actually call this
108:56 - series look at the parentheses at the
108:57 - end
108:58 - devs got talent let's do that that's
109:01 - yo guys should be like yo guys welcome
109:04 - to another episode of dev's got talent
109:06 - does your app have what it takes we'll
109:09 - find out
109:10 - right after this break
109:19 - is like that's a great idea
109:23 - i love it dev's gotta tell who likes it

109:30 - okay cool so let's take a look at this i
109:34 - mean honestly
109:35 - i'm already liking what i'm seeing here
109:37 - i like the graphs and everything boom
109:40 - give me everything in one place i'm a
109:41 - sucker for that
109:43 - i like that your your circular images
109:46 - are also looking
109:47 - good they're looking great the country
109:49 - names i mean
109:50 - i love that it says cases and country i
109:52 - don't like when
109:53 - this over here doesn't say anything
109:56 - that's always confusing to me because i
109:58 - have to figure out what it is
109:59 - then you guys make me read this it's why
110:01 - are you making me do so much work like
110:03 - just say cases above it so that's good
110:07 - it's already sorted so that's good
110:10 - functionality
110:12 - i like the icons he's using and the
110:14 - colors so this color
110:16 - maps the color here maps to this the
110:19 - icons are
110:20 - great for recovered i mean i like the
110:23 - design so for me the front end design is
110:25 - pretty good
110:26 - the news is phenomenal one of the best
110:29 - solid yeah the new one of the best news
110:32 - ones
110:33 - and even be supportive be careful be
110:35 - alert be kind be ready to fight covet
110:37 - 19. i mean that is
110:38 - a great use case of it i did not know
110:41 - that this is actually like
110:43 - vertical scrollable like i don't know
110:45 - either i like it
110:47 - so i would do something with that
110:50 - let me so honestly
110:54 - before i let not speak i'm just gonna
110:56 - actually i'll i'll hold my ratings
110:58 - until the end so now as you you can go
111:00 - ahead and talk about this too
111:02 - yeah so okay so check this out i love i
111:06 - love
111:06 - you know how you you're using a lot of
111:07 - the real estate which is great
111:09 - i love your icons those really small
111:11 - icons in the top left i know they just
111:13 - add some playful to it like it's just
111:14 - some
111:14 - playfulness you know which is really
111:16 - cool they just add a little bit of
111:17 - iphone
111:18 - to the to the desks yeah it's a little
111:20 - bit of playfulness
111:22 - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so the icons
111:24 - like
111:25 - icons are well no you know what i mean
111:27 - like i know i know what you mean i'm
111:28 - just messing around i'm just messing
111:30 - around
111:30 - yeah yeah yeah so functionality wise
111:32 - it's good i like that
111:34 - um you know the fact that you know you
111:36 - are it's sorted that's really good as
111:38 - well
111:38 - you don't need to have countries and
111:40 - cases in there like you
111:42 - already are saying live cases by country
111:44 - you do not need to
111:45 - have also like the header the table
111:47 - header in there as well
111:48 - you know it's fine people will know that
111:50 - this is the cases because you said
111:52 - like i see what you're saying so like
111:55 - remove
111:56 - this header at the top nice okay yeah
111:58 - that would actually just make it simpler
112:01 - exactly exactly yeah so you don't need
112:03 - that um
112:04 - i'm not a big i i mean yes i like to
112:07 - have everything in like total cases
112:09 - globally the whole map
112:10 - not the whole map but the chart i like
112:13 - how
112:14 - yes it's good to have everything on one
112:16 - total right to have all
112:18 - total cases recover and deaths in there
112:20 - but i think
112:21 - i know i'm a big fan of looking at one
112:23 - thing at a time and then kind of trying
112:25 - to because otherwise it's just it's too
112:26 - much to see what's going on
112:27 - too many things yeah i see so what would
112:30 - you give this
112:32 - i'll give this probably probably
112:36 - i'll give it an eight i'll give an eight
112:38 - yeah
112:39 - yeah um
112:42 - yeah this is honestly uh so i like what
112:44 - elijah says
112:46 - elijah says i get the feeling that this
112:48 - developer used their site a lot
112:50 - during creation the user experience
112:52 - seems pretty good
112:54 - yeah jen oh nice jen actually goes way
112:57 - to go nero i'm a proud mentor
113:00 - so jen was actually mentoring nero in
113:03 - profit with javascript that's awesome
113:06 - mm-hmm yeah honestly i would i gotta
113:09 - give it like
113:10 - a 8 to 8.5 i'll just give it a 8.5
113:14 - just because um i got
113:18 - all my functionality and then it's
113:20 - really good looking on the eyes
113:23 - it's already sorted by the top cases the
113:26 - image for the countries are there
113:29 - i can fully search my stats are there
113:31 - and then the news just
113:33 - the news like most people's news is
113:36 - where you guys
113:37 - fail pretty hard like new york news
113:40 - makes it seem like i'm on some
113:41 - like scam site um because i
113:44 - feel like people kind of are just
113:46 - treating it as like a throwaway
113:48 - but if you do your news right it can
113:50 - actually make your site look
113:52 - even better yeah so good that
113:55 - i i really liked it about this so from
113:58 - eight to eight point five is where i
114:00 - would put this
114:00 - at and the small the small animation
114:02 - when you hover over the news
114:04 - like yeah like it animates up you could
114:07 - you could you could you'd you could
114:08 - download that down just a tad
114:10 - right you don't have to be having it be
114:12 - so much but like a small animation
114:14 - perfect perfect yeah yeah so nice job on
114:17 - this nero great job this is a 8 to 8.5
114:22 - um okay great so this is nero
114:26 - and then here this is not live not
114:28 - completed but i want to show my effort i
114:30 - mean this is
114:31 - pretty broken when i looked at it
114:34 - um but it seems like he was about to
114:37 - take it somewhere
114:38 - so it could have been cool but um
114:41 - i don't know just because it's not
114:43 - functional i don't think we should even
114:44 - look at it that much
114:46 - yeah yeah yeah no no no yeah i mean i
114:49 - mean it works i love
114:51 - here's well here's where i'll give this
114:52 - guys like the for example that map
114:55 - right the map that you see that map is
114:57 - actually not easy to create
114:59 - that map with like this geography map
115:01 - right there geolocation map but that's
115:02 - not an easy map
115:04 - because it's not from google maps right
115:06 - it is from google maps but it's
115:07 - it's using different you're using a
115:09 - different kind of uh
115:10 - style maps um that style is not the
115:13 - easiest style to create so
115:15 - got it yeah okay i'll give that all
115:18 - right got it i think i'm gonna get out
115:19 - of this one just because we we do need
115:21 - completed submissions to rate it against
115:24 - um okay i think we have went through
115:27 - all of them so what do you think now is
115:30 - it time to make our
115:32 - final decisions guys who's
115:35 - pumped to make a final decision who
115:37 - wants to know
115:38 - who got the first place the second place
115:41 - and the third place and they said maybe
115:44 - we'll do and maybe we'll do who got the
115:46 - worst place
115:48 - yeah a runner runners up so guys
115:50 - remember
115:51 - first place gets five hundred dollars
115:54 - second place gets 250 dollars
115:59 - and then third place gets 100
116:05 - so guys start putting your winners you
116:08 - know we're just gonna
116:08 - scroll through like the top so if you
116:11 - guys have any
116:12 - winners in mind you guys can
116:16 - drop them down below i think i wanna
116:19 - still kind of decide
116:21 - so i'm gonna take so now as you go ahead
116:24 - and make it take a decision and guys i'm
116:26 - gonna kind of like focus not even that
116:28 - much on the live stream i think i'm
116:29 - gonna kind of focus and decide
116:31 - who the winner is and the nas and i are
116:33 - gonna come together and hopefully make a
116:35 - final decision okay so
116:36 - just be with us imagine there's like who
116:39 - wants to be a millionaire type of
116:40 - dramatic music playing
116:42 - and uh let's go do you have any music
116:44 - playing do you have any music that you
116:46 - could you can play
116:47 - be like no i would love to actually let
116:51 - me see if i can
116:54 - uh honestly i don't know how to and i
116:57 - could really mess things up
117:01 - ah yeah let's not let's not worry about
117:02 - it right now okay let's just play it
117:04 - with our mouth
117:09 - all right i'm i'm taking a look at this
117:10 - and i'm just kind of gonna
117:12 - be deciding you guys can take a look at
117:14 - my screen with me
117:17 - yeah guys drop drop your your three
117:19 - winners in the comments guys
117:21 - who do you think won in the comments
117:24 - let me see i'm just gonna put i'm gonna
117:26 - take a few that i really liked
117:28 - hold on now they're getting all like
117:32 - jumbled up in my head dude
117:37 - no i think there's a few that stand out
117:39 - to me personally
117:40 - um amanot is like can we make a poll at
117:44 - paul eevee.com that actually could be
117:46 - pretty cool but
117:48 - that'd be hard right now
117:51 - and then actually hold on
117:56 - but the question is like who's the first
117:57 - place you know what i mean
117:59 - like the best one guys who do you think
118:02 - had the best
118:03 - one out of all these
118:08 - i'm seeing man i think
118:14 - um man
118:18 - jensen's really good too i they're i'm
118:20 - getting mixed up with them right now
118:23 - they're like getting that chance right
118:25 - there that's right i know
118:26 - i mean yeah i know that i'm just saying
118:29 - like i'm getting mixed up in terms of
118:31 - like
118:32 - i forgot what were the really good
118:34 - points about some of them
118:40 - um people say people are saying nero
118:44 - no no that's frankie okay so okay
118:47 - honestly i kind of feel like that i have
118:51 - um
118:53 - i have my first one
118:57 - um i feel like i kind of got my first
119:00 - one and i'm gonna just slack it to you
119:02 - and you tell me
119:03 - what you think okay and we can kind of
119:07 - decide in slack and hopefully we can
119:09 - come to some kind of unanimous decision
119:11 - on it
119:11 - that would be great but i am thinking
119:18 - this really interesting okay
119:21 - um hold on
119:24 - let me see
119:38 - that's kind of what i am thinking now so
119:40 - guys right now i'm actually messaging
119:42 - nas it's almost the equivalent of like
119:44 - i'm going behind
119:45 - camera to just kind of like whisper in
119:47 - his ear and talk to him
119:48 - so we're discussing this on our private
119:51 - slack channel
119:52 - and deciding who the winner is before we
119:54 - actually announce it
119:55 - live because that's the person who's
119:57 - gonna get 500
119:59 - and um this is what i'm
120:03 - leaning towards nas let me know
120:06 - yeah i know i know you might be i know
120:10 - like yeah yeah but
120:13 - functionality wise yes it's there yeah
120:17 - i get it i get it what i what i would
120:20 - say
120:21 - is like it's probably something i would
120:23 - realistically
120:25 - use on a pretty active basis i could
120:28 - imagine it being a bookmark on my chrome
120:31 - and i would go to it and check stats
120:34 - and check what's happening like okay
120:38 - yeah i mean i i give i give pretty i
120:40 - give a pretty high score for that one so
120:42 - yeah i would
120:43 - i would say so that could be number one
120:44 - i would say i would agree with you yeah
120:46 - on that
120:46 - yeah let's do that okay all right guys i
120:49 - think
120:49 - so should we announce our first right
120:52 - now but we should do a third place and
120:53 - that was third place
120:54 - second place and then announced third
120:55 - floor
121:00 - i see okay third place first okay got it
121:02 - got it
121:03 - all right do you have anybody for third
121:05 - place yeah i have an idea actually okay
121:08 - cool i mean for third place you have to
121:10 - know second place
121:12 - well hold on so should we should we find
121:14 - out second place and then third place
121:18 - yeah let's do let's do a second let's do
121:19 - second place i i think i already know
121:21 - a second place okay okay so drop it in
121:24 - the chat if you
121:26 - uh yeah say this would be
121:31 - don't say it out loud okay okay
121:42 - let me know when you've dropped it i did
121:46 - okay cool i'll go take a look at it
121:49 - because i'm just looking at some of the
121:50 - apps that are up there already okay if
121:53 - you take a look at it they don't know
121:55 - what i'm talking about
121:56 - one second relax i know what
121:59 - okay okay i think i think that's fair
122:02 - wait wait
122:03 - wait don't show don't show slack you're
122:05 - showing i don't i'm not i'm not
122:07 - you can see it because you're looking at
122:09 - skype on ecam
122:11 - i'm not showing that so don't worry okay
122:13 - okay
122:14 - um so i think second place i agree i
122:18 - 100 agree okay okay
122:21 - um maybe you can give it ratings kind of
122:24 - like how
122:25 - how i gave it for first place like on
122:28 - three
122:28 - different things functionality mobile
122:31 - responsiveness and front end
122:33 - and then you kind of give those ratings
122:34 - so then we can have a good reason for
122:36 - what
122:37 - who why that person got second place
122:41 - man this is exciting this is crazy
122:44 - abdullah is like whoa
122:46 - suspense yeah guys this is crazy
122:51 - oh man okay now i think we're just
122:54 - picking our third
122:55 - place right now so let's take a look i'm
122:58 - gonna have i'm gonna open up a few
123:01 - and i'm just gonna take a look at what's
123:03 - happening on some of the other like i'm
123:04 - opening some of them that i kind of
123:06 - forgot about
123:12 - um guys
123:16 - this is interesting actually this is
123:17 - like literally like
123:20 - this is very interesting style and we
123:23 - got i'm not gonna have it we have
123:26 - and then i would say
123:29 - oh crap i almost showed our slack
123:32 - oh really because i was checking i was
123:35 - checking mobile responsiveness and i uh
123:50 - okay would you agree with me on that
123:54 - what i just sent you
123:58 - let me see let me see without showing
124:00 - everybody
124:01 - um yeah
124:05 - yeah but let's pick uh third place right
124:07 - so let's pick third place
124:09 - so third place for me is between
124:12 - um
124:18 - so oh
124:24 - okay okay i totally forgot about that
124:28 - you know what's funny guys is you guys
124:29 - have no idea what we're talking about

124:52 - okay people are saying we closed our
124:53 - eyes we didn't see slack

125:50 - that's what i so um
126:00 - you think so man yeah cause i would
126:03 - actually use it dude like i would
126:05 - actually use it i
126:07 - really like looking at it i think the
126:10 - innovation is important but i don't
126:12 - think we can put innovation on that much
126:14 - of a pedestal over like
126:16 - design and functionality you know what i
126:18 - mean so yeah yeah
126:19 - that's important like the design of this
126:23 - is really nice you know
126:26 - yeah i agree i mean the icon the icons
126:29 - the
126:30 - the color theme i would have to go with
126:34 - this one so now you guys know there's
126:36 - icons
126:37 - yeah you do know that so i think i mean
126:40 - what
126:41 - i feel like yeah let's do i oh yeah
126:44 - let's do i think i think yeah
126:45 - yeah yeah let's do it yeah yeah but
126:47 - let's give it like the functionality

127:13 - number hold on we gotta be careful with
127:14 - that hold on
127:15 - i mean it doesn't matter as long as it's
127:17 - in you know
127:18 - as we just have the positions i think

128:30 - people and we just want to say everybody
128:32 - did a great job on these submissions i
128:35 - mean just take a look at these
128:36 - submissions
128:37 - they are absolutely phenomenal you guys
128:40 - crushed it with every project but with

128:53 - place winner
128:56 - and before we actually hold on before we
128:59 - actually say that
129:00 - we are rating these on three different
129:02 - things so let's actually just explain to
129:04 - everybody kind of what's our
129:06 - metric okay we are rating each one of
129:10 - these

129:17 - rating this on
129:18 - functionality we're reading this on
129:21 - um mobile responsiveness
129:26 - and then we're reading this on what's
129:29 - the third one nas
129:31 - and and design front end
129:34 - design front end design so like how does
129:38 - it actually look
129:39 - okay so those are the three things we're
129:41 - rating each of these on and based on
129:44 - that we're deciding who the winners are

130:36 - okay so uh and now let's open up jen's
130:40 - app
130:41 - here and actually let's take a look at
130:44 - what's going on
130:47 - so how did we rate this nas
130:51 - so here's what we looked at we looked at
130:53 - functionality
130:54 - front end and mobile friendliness right
130:57 - now what are the
130:58 - what are the numbers that we gave uh we
131:00 - gave a kazi in terms of functionality
131:02 - you tell me because i can't okay i have
131:05 - it on
131:06 - we have a nine a nine out of ten for
131:08 - functionality right
131:09 - yeah it's it's easy to use the news are
131:12 - there
131:13 - right right it's clean it's good and so
131:16 - i love the functionality even it's
131:18 - sorted it's sorted by the top countries
131:21 - first that's one of the first things i
131:22 - look at anytime i go to any type of
131:24 - covid app
131:25 - i can see the growth at a global level
131:28 - and
131:28 - really important i want to type in
131:30 - specific countries so for me i would
131:32 - want to type in usa and i can just see
131:34 - that
131:35 - right away and it's super clear so i
131:38 - love that
131:38 - jen said totally made my day love that
131:42 - hey love it love it love it yeah
131:46 - okay so then so functionality it's a
131:48 - nine out of ten
131:49 - nine front end 9.5 out of 10
131:53 - front end so why is the front end 9.5
131:56 - out of 10 on this nas
131:58 - yeah so 9.5 because okay so here's what
132:02 - what i love i love how you kept the
132:04 - colors consistent really cool right
132:07 - um colors are consistent and i love the
132:09 - use of your icons
132:10 - it's just like it just makes sense icons
132:13 - are so good yeah they make
132:14 - complete sense right it just makes sense
132:17 - you know
132:18 - the only thing i would fix in this case
132:20 - is like you know you
132:21 - you could make the news better that is
132:24 - why it's not
132:25 - it's a 9.5 instead of like a 10.10 10
132:28 - out of 10 you know
132:29 - right exactly the news i think could be
132:32 - better other than that it's really good
132:33 - i mean the countries look great
132:35 - the taxi used looks crisp modern
132:39 - i mean it's it's gorgeous it's really
132:41 - really gorgeous
132:42 - um i love looking at it i would actually
132:44 - use this you know
132:46 - so yeah yeah so this is a design wise
132:49 - it did great and then the third one we
132:52 - did it on
132:53 - is mobile responsiveness and which is
132:56 - which is hold on it is very mobile
132:59 - responsive
133:00 - i'm probably not gonna show everything

135:02 - usage i think is clean i mean i gave it
135:06 - we gave it some extra points for
135:08 - innovation because this is completely
135:09 - different than what nas showed everybody
135:11 - to build
135:12 - so that requires a lot of thought and a
135:15 - lot of effort you guys because nas had
135:17 - thought about that one for a really long
135:18 - time
135:20 - so yeah yeah yeah definitely on that

135:34 - and then functionality

135:39 - like
135:39 - you've got all the necessary things i
135:41 - love how you have that
135:43 - how you have like for example the total
135:44 - cases and you have the like half
135:46 - that half bar there right yeah um
135:49 - yeah that's there the only thing we just
135:51 - you know why it's 8 out of 10 is just
135:53 - you know the map
135:54 - is a bit too big right right it's you
135:56 - know you don't really need that
135:57 - um yes and and you're only showing the
136:00 - top 10
136:01 - countries so you know if you show only
136:04 - to all the countries and so forth like
136:05 - that you know
136:06 - that could have made it a little better
136:08 - but um
136:09 - yeah i do like yeah i do like that you
136:13 - have symptoms and resources and
136:15 - prevention like all of that so that's
136:16 - really really good

140:02 - is
140:07 - kelly oh wow we said that like at the
140:10 - same time holy moly yeah that was
140:12 - perfect timing awesome
140:15 - so let's take a look at this app
140:18 - over here first of all
140:22 - i mean the front end is
140:25 - on point all the front-end functionality
140:29 - is
140:29 - all there but let's go through the list
140:31 - and kind of rate it
140:32 - so nas uh how did we break this
140:36 - down can you can you tell us yeah
140:39 - so functionality wise we gave a 10 out
140:43 - of 10.
140:44 - now why do we give it a 10 out of 10
140:46 - kazi
140:48 - because guys look what
140:51 - what do you want to know when you go to
140:53 - a website and you want to find out
140:55 - coronavirus stats
140:56 - you want to know how your country is
140:59 - doing
141:00 - but you also want to know how the world
141:03 - is doing
141:04 - and so if i just go here and i sorted by
141:08 - cases
141:09 - that instantly tells me everything i
141:12 - need to know
141:13 - i can also see and sorted by debts and
141:16 - that tells me oh man like
141:17 - uk things are looking bad those are some
141:19 - of the most important things that i want
141:21 - to know
141:22 - but the reason why this gets a 10 and
141:24 - not just an
141:25 - eight or a nine in functionality is why
141:28 - nas why i think you would know why
141:32 - why qazi the search
141:35 - that is the winner on this guys like
141:38 - look at that
141:39 - it's so fast if i go mexico if i go usa
141:43 - if i go brazil i don't as a user the
141:46 - user experience we should have rated
141:47 - things on user experience too i forgot
141:49 - user experience on this is 10 out of 10.
141:52 - so like
141:53 - i can just search up any country i can
141:55 - think of and it's just so fast i don't
141:58 - have to hit
141:58 - enter i don't have to like wait for it
142:01 - to pop
142:01 - up it's just all right there and it's so
142:04 - fast
142:05 - yeah so it's thought out so he thought
142:07 - about the user experience of this
142:09 - application right
142:11 - not just about how it looks whoa tommy
142:13 - kelly is on here
142:15 - is he hey i just i just dropped his
142:18 - comment on the live stream tommy kelly
142:20 - awesome job he says thank you all
142:24 - let's go tommy tommy wait maybe he can
142:26 - get out get on the call as well if he's
142:28 - able to
142:29 - yeah on the skype so take a look at this
142:31 - you guys like i can actually click on
142:33 - france and it opens up that country it
142:35 - doesn't do that weird thing where it
142:37 - like
142:37 - zooms in with the map and like has
142:41 - all this everything becomes slow it's
142:43 - fast if i type in spain
142:45 - boom peru it's fast like it's actually
142:49 - really really useful and i can use this
142:51 - app you know on a daily basis
142:53 - now if i hit recovered or total cases i
142:56 - can actually see the growth of recovery
142:59 - of cases if i do total cases i can see
143:01 - that as well
143:04 - yep and then the news what i really like
143:07 - about the news on this is the fact that
143:09 - he used
143:10 - twitter twitter instantly gives your
143:13 - news credibility it makes it
143:15 - not look like it's a spam or something
143:18 - like an
143:18 - ad because most people's news the
143:20 - mistake they made is it makes it look
143:22 - like an
143:22 - ad this looks like real news it's cnn
143:26 - verified badge i recognize this to be
143:29 - twitter
143:30 - and it makes me actually his news is
143:33 - really the only news i actually
143:34 - really pay attention paid attention to
143:38 - yeah i would agree so i would agree so
143:40 - it's it's
143:42 - pretty easily laid out to where you can
143:44 - you know i can you know
143:45 - like i literally actually just this is
143:46 - the first time like i actually listened
143:48 - i mean looked at the news and like
143:50 - it said hong kong disneyland will close
143:52 - again after surgery corner virus cases
143:53 - like this the first time they actually
143:55 - you know
143:55 - paid attention and read the news on a
143:58 - site like this right so um
144:00 - i think i think that makes a lot of that
144:02 - made that says a lot
144:03 - you know i love the addition of symptoms
144:05 - you know that you got on there
144:07 - just as a helpful suggestions which is
144:09 - great
144:10 - um yeah just overall user experience of
144:12 - this is is
144:14 - really good and i love it really good so
144:16 - we rated it 10 out of 10 on
144:18 - functionality
144:19 - uh now on the front end design this gets
144:22 - a pretty high rating what does it what
144:24 - does this get nas on front end
144:26 - front end we get a 9 out of 10. 9 out of
144:29 - 10.
144:30 - okay um and then what about just like
144:33 - few things like for example this says
144:35 - simpsons instead of symptoms
144:38 - yeah so like just a little you know and
144:40 - like maybe the twitter could
144:42 - be above this instead of just like plus
144:43 - sign thing and then i don't like this
144:45 - banner at all like this banner just kind
144:48 - of takes away so that's why nine out of
144:49 - ten but
144:50 - overall it's very clean and then on
144:53 - mobile responsiveness nas what does this
144:55 - get
144:57 - that gets a 10 out of 10
145:00 - right absolutely yeah it's mobile
145:03 - responsive it's got no problem at all
145:05 - when you go
145:06 - to mobile it's just so you know it's
145:07 - going to be used on mobile as well

154:42 - really important thing that we do in

155:05 - practical for you
155:07 - yeah yeah what do you what do you think
155:10 - about these calls nas are they valuable
155:14 - are you kidding me guys these are if you
155:16 - ask any of our students guys
155:18 - these calls are one of the most valuable
155:21 - things that part of this course
155:22 - is actually we actually have a student
155:24 - literally come in he's like soul rock
155:26 - just says
155:27 - i came in late being in a coaching call
155:29 - with prophet with javascript
155:31 - so he actually just jumped in from the
155:33 - coaching call from javascript but yeah
155:35 - go ahead
155:36 - keep keep tell us about this guys is
155:39 - these coaching calls we have about four
155:40 - coaching calls every single week at this
155:42 - point
155:43 - you know me sonny kazee you know we
155:46 - teach you guys
155:47 - how to go from basically zero right
155:50 - zero to actually you know knowing having
155:52 - amazing projects
155:54 - on your portfolio knowing the good
155:56 - foundation of development
155:58 - and just being ready to go out there and
156:00 - you know
156:01 - into the real world right so and these
156:03 - coaching calls you get to ask us
156:05 - you know direct questions we get to
156:08 - personally
156:09 - talk with you right and you know that
156:12 - type of level of connection
156:15 - right your health you're not gonna get
156:18 - what else
156:19 - yeah you're not gonna get that anywhere
156:21 - else guys and one other important thing
156:22 - i want to highlight for you
156:24 - is the fact that you get a personalized
156:27 - success coach
156:28 - so if you guys remember nero's project
156:31 - is covatracker and i don't know if i
156:35 - have it open
156:36 - but jen who won third place was actually
156:40 - his success coach
156:42 - so every single student in this program
156:44 - gets a dedicated success coach that
156:46 - gives you personalized video feedback
156:48 - on all of the projects that you do
156:50 - wouldn't that be exciting
156:52 - to actually get video feedback on every
156:55 - single thing that you submit like
156:57 - think about that just for a second i
156:59 - mean imagine you built this covet
157:01 - project and you got a video feedback
157:03 - kind of like how we gave you a video
157:04 - feedback
157:06 - so that's i think something super
157:08 - important and then nas you want to speak
157:10 - to
157:10 - the slack community yeah i mean
157:14 - what i was going to get but i
157:20 - don't even get personalized you know
157:22 - video feedback
157:24 - you know as we get here when i was in
157:25 - college right they don't do that for you
157:27 - right so
157:28 - you know that is extremely very
157:29 - extremely important extremely valuable
157:31 - but in terms of guys in terms of you
157:33 - know in terms of the actual community
157:35 - we have a slack community that's around
157:37 - at this point 1500
157:39 - students 1500 students
157:42 - everybody on there everybody on there is
157:45 - supportive
157:46 - they're there to help each other out
157:48 - they're they're they are there to
157:49 - push each other answer questions ask
157:52 - questions i mean literally if it's
157:55 - literally like a
157:56 - family like a gen gen right there says
157:59 - it's a slack family
158:00 - right it is it is really a family yeah
158:03 - so even if we go here like if you take a
158:05 - look at this
158:06 - everybody's asking questions they're
158:08 - getting their questions
158:09 - answered this is the kovitt tracker
158:12 - challenge that we told everybody to be
158:14 - ready for
158:15 - so you're not going to find a community
158:17 - that's just hands down more engaged and
158:20 - better as like the qua and in terms of
158:22 - the quality
158:23 - it's going to be really hard to ever
158:24 - find that so we give you guys
158:26 - all of this at essentially fraction of a
158:29 - cost of a coding bootcamp
158:30 - but honestly most of the students who
158:33 - have been here
158:34 - they literally tell us this that they're
158:35 - like hey i went to a six-month coding
158:38 - bootcamp that i paid ten thousand
158:39 - dollars for
158:41 - and he goes this program is actually
158:43 - worth more this course has given me way
158:45 - more
158:45 - than my six-month coding bootcamp so
158:49 - that's just like saying it's insane and
