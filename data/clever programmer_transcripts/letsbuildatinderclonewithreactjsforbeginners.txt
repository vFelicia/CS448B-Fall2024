00:14 - it's pretty cool because we're gonna get
00:15 - to see how you guys can go ahead and
00:17 - build that swiping functionality
00:19 - that is so big in tinder and loads of
00:21 - other apps actually used
00:23 - so i'm pretty pumped pretty pumped yeah
00:25 - all right man i'm

00:29 - be getting started into it in just a
00:30 - little bit but guys take a look at this
00:32 - whole thing so we're just going to demo
00:34 - the app
00:35 - for you guys right now so you guys will

01:14 - sunny
01:16 - so we are also going to be showing um
01:19 - so if we go back yeah so you see how we
01:22 - can pretty much go back and forth
01:24 - between different screens guys
01:25 - so that's actually using something
01:27 - called react router to do that
01:28 - so we're going to be showing you guys
01:29 - how you can build that and how you can
01:31 - have like flow through an app so you can
01:32 - have different screens
01:34 - working on a single reactor which is
01:36 - pretty cool
01:37 - and also guys these live these cards
01:40 - that uh you see that cause you're
01:41 - swiping through right now
01:42 - they're not being they're not hard coded
01:44 - they're being pulled from a firebase
01:46 - database
01:47 - and you can also notice that if you see
01:48 - the url right there that's actually a
01:50 - firebase hosted url which means that we
01:52 - deployed this app so we're going to show
01:54 - you how to use the firebase database
01:57 - in order to sort of get these cards up
01:59 - and rendering on the screen and then
02:00 - we're going to show you how to deploy it
02:01 - and get it live so you can host it on
02:03 - your portfolio yep
02:05 - so guys this is going to be pretty
02:07 - freaking exciting
02:08 - this build is going to be awesome i hope
02:10 - that you guys are excited about this

02:56 - phones
02:57 - post a story on your social media so
03:00 - instagram
03:01 - and you can tell you can get me and
03:03 - carzi's tag right here at the bottom
03:05 - um and go ahead and shoot some stories
03:07 - because that actually allows us guys to
03:09 - start up a conversation with you guys
03:10 - if you guys enjoy it it tells us pretty
03:12 - much that you guys are watching we love

03:21 - is going to be
03:22 - awesome uh i broke 500 people
03:25 - live awesome guys so with that said
03:28 - this is going to be the build right so
03:31 - this is the app
03:32 - just demoing it for any of you guys
03:34 - maybe we're seeing it a little bit later
03:36 - um and then because of react router we
03:38 - can actually move around anywhere so
03:40 - we'll be showing you guys all of this
03:41 - functionality and how you can build it
03:43 - with that said let's just jump straight
03:44 - into it so what should we do sunny
03:48 - so first thing is guys you can see me
03:50 - and kazi are actually sharing a terminal
03:52 - because we're using a vs code live share
03:54 - so first step is let's actually go ahead
03:56 - and i'm not sure can i actually access
03:58 - your terminal right now um
04:00 - let's go ahead and share a terminal
04:02 - right there
04:05 - yeah uh nice let me double go ahead and
04:08 - find the terminal
04:11 - there we go i think you need to share it
04:14 - in uh the live share
04:15 - settings yeah oh no we got it we have
04:18 - got it nice i need to get it i'll make
04:19 - it um
04:20 - yep there we go you can read and write
04:22 - though
04:24 - there you go so now there we go so the
04:26 - first step that you guys want to do guys
04:28 - is um so
04:32 - yeah there we go is that that is the
04:33 - right one right yeah
04:35 - cls if i type in yo can you see that
04:38 - yeah there we go
04:38 - nice okay so with that said guys the
04:41 - first tool that we're going to use is
04:43 - something called create react app so
04:44 - this is something that facebook built
04:45 - and we've used it in all of our builds
04:47 - so far
04:48 - and all you need to do is go ahead and
04:49 - type mpx create
04:51 - react oops create react app and then the
04:55 - name of your app so in this case let's
04:56 - go ahead and call it the tinder clone
04:59 - right and what that's going to do is
05:01 - that's actually going to go and launch
05:02 - that tool and then build a project a
05:04 - star project
05:05 - called tinder clone right and remember
05:07 - try not to have spaces there
05:09 - just use a dash in between so this will
05:11 - actually go ahead set every single thing
05:13 - up that we need in order to get
05:14 - um react a react starter project up and
05:17 - running
05:18 - so with that said i think what we can do
05:20 - at this point is let's go and head over
05:21 - to firebase
05:23 - and get that set up so everything's
05:25 - ready on that front one
05:26 - by the time this is we get this back yep
05:29 - and guys we're not gonna be posting the
05:31 - link to the app we're gonna be hosting a
05:33 - github repo and put it there because
05:35 - youtube took down our video or amazon
05:37 - video actually
05:38 - um the other day because they were
05:42 - thinking that they just didn't like that
05:44 - we were sending people to an amazon
05:46 - clone
05:47 - yeah and so even though we weren't doing
05:50 - anything
05:50 - bad but they were like hey you guys are
05:52 - sending people to amazon clone
05:54 - so that kind of threw us off a lot you
05:57 - know it was like scary it's like oh my
05:58 - god this video has 60 000 views and it
06:00 - just took it down
06:01 - and so we're but that video is now back
06:04 - up so we're not going to be dropping the
06:06 - link to the clone
06:07 - but we'll drop a github repo later and
06:10 - then you guys can just click the live
06:11 - link or you can just try to read the
06:13 - link
06:13 - from the url and go to it exactly
06:17 - yeah so guys
06:20 - the next what we're going to do next is
06:22 - we're actually going to go ahead and set
06:23 - up
06:23 - firebase so to get firebase up and
06:26 - running all you need is a google account
06:27 - so it's good news it's really easy to
06:28 - get that up and going
06:30 - um so once you're at this screen what
06:31 - you want to do is go ahead and click add
06:33 - project
06:35 - yeah and then this type in tinder dash
06:38 - clone
06:41 - and then it's just a simple case of
06:42 - clicking continue you can enable google
06:44 - analytics
06:45 - there we go create project there we go
06:47 - and guys what this is doing now is
06:49 - you're setting up a
06:50 - so firebase is essentially just a suite
06:52 - of tools by google
06:53 - allows you to do authentication allows
06:55 - you to uh manage all your data there
06:58 - allows you to deploy your website and it
07:00 - allows you to do a bunch of
07:01 - other cool stuff um and we're going to
07:03 - show you a bunch of that today
07:05 - so let's go ahead and see if the app's
07:07 - finished installing so it's almost done
07:09 - so it's almost done but while that's
07:11 - still installing what we can do is just
07:13 - click
07:14 - continue
07:17 - yep and what we need to do now is we
07:20 - need to get a magic
07:21 - sort of config file so on the top left
07:23 - we'll see something where it says
07:25 - project overview
07:26 - and a little cog let's click that cog
07:30 - yeah and then project settings and let's
07:31 - go down to the bottom
07:33 - and let's go ahead and yep that web app
07:36 - one that's it
07:37 - and let's type in a tinder clone i'm not
07:39 - sure why they ask you for two names here
07:41 - but
07:41 - whoops i meant that's all right
07:45 - that's right you can you can do it yeah
07:47 - that's fine
07:48 - without even checking that box yeah yeah
07:51 - we can go because afterwards what we can
07:52 - go ahead and do is we can go to the
07:55 - firebase hosting tab and it should just
07:57 - work from there
07:59 - okay i think i went too fast so let's uh
08:03 - where's the tinder so right here tender
08:05 - clone yup
08:07 - and then i think this is the app right
08:10 - yep that's the one if we go down to the
08:14 - bottom
08:14 - oh there we go so you see the config
08:17 - yeah so we just needed that guy so what
08:18 - you want to do at this point is just
08:20 - copy it
08:21 - and keep it in like a separate notes or
08:23 - something else but you just want to have
08:24 - that
08:25 - on the side um so you can we can use
08:27 - that later on
08:28 - yo amanat is in the house what's going
08:30 - on dude nice
08:32 - he's like hope you how are y'all doing
08:34 - kazzy and sonny awesome
08:36 - doing all good bro nice okay so now we
08:40 - have
08:41 - the config file and guys what that's
08:42 - going to allow you to do is once we
08:44 - actually get the app up and running
08:45 - that's going to be the magic piece that
08:47 - connects our app to our firebase
08:50 - sort of back end okay so with that said
08:52 - now we have the app up and running it's
08:54 - perfect so it will basically at the end
08:56 - of it it'll say
08:57 - happy hacking and it'll tell you some
08:58 - instructions so in this case
09:00 - make sure you do this step guys because
09:02 - if you we we've sometimes accidentally
09:03 - forgot this so what we need to do is
09:05 - do cd tinder clone yeah yeah
09:08 - funny yeah so that way you actually go
09:11 - inside the file
09:12 - uh inside the photo so make sure you're
09:14 - in here so when you do ls
09:15 - i am better says awesome he goes i
09:18 - should spend more than 200
09:19 - to learn this online but it's free here
09:23 - oh amazing i feel like it was a chance
09:26 - my brother oh that's amazing i love
09:28 - stuff about that
09:29 - thank you appreciate that
09:33 - so once you're in the tinder clone
09:35 - folder guys
09:36 - it's very simple to get started all you
09:38 - need to do is run mpm
09:40 - start and mpm start is basically just
09:42 - going to start the sort of
09:44 - the react app is going to get everything
09:45 - up and running and working for you
09:48 - and it will launch it on localhost 3000
09:51 - and you should get this perfect little
09:52 - react spinning icon which is really nice
09:55 - and everything works once we get to that
09:56 - point
09:58 - okay perfect i love that spinner man i
10:02 - hate when you remove it but it's okay
10:04 - i know i know it's uh yeah so guys if
10:08 - you get to this page
10:10 - well done like you've set up your first
10:11 - react project so that's a really good
10:13 - step and the next thing we like to do is
10:15 - walk quasi
10:16 - uh we're gonna remove these three files
10:18 - that i put a little x over
10:20 - and it's gonna be the test and the logo
10:21 - file
10:23 - yep exactly that so the reason why we do
10:25 - that guys is we don't need the test
10:26 - files for now
10:27 - uh when you sort of get a bit more
10:29 - advanced into a short reactive element
10:31 - you can use those but at this point we
10:32 - don't really need those
10:34 - um then you want to go ahead and clean
10:35 - up the app js file so you're gonna get
10:38 - rid of t
10:39 - where's my um vim maybe i don't have
10:42 - them on here huh
10:44 - oh is it not go vim no i don't think i
10:47 - have my vim on here but it's all good
10:49 - okay cool we're gonna just do that put a
10:51 - little h1
10:52 - here and say let's build the
10:57 - tinder clone app dope
11:01 - boom right there remove this guy
11:06 - save and refresh and that's what you
11:08 - guys should have so make sure guys
11:10 - remove that logo at the top because
11:12 - otherwise you're gonna get a compilation
11:13 - error because we're not
11:14 - using the logo anymore we deleted it
11:17 - exactly so once you get to this point
11:19 - that's a very good place to be
11:21 - there's one more step involved in the
11:22 - cleanup process
11:24 - which is um oh nice we have someone
11:26 - watching watching
11:28 - yeah i was pumped i was like damn dope
11:30 - man
11:31 - that's nice damn we're up to 677 people
11:33 - now guys that is awesome
11:35 - thank you guys so much for giving all
11:37 - that love really appreciate you
11:39 - thank you so much and smash that like
11:41 - button let's get
11:42 - it smash [ __ ] right now
11:47 - so the next step guys is you want to go
11:49 - into your app.css
11:52 - and you want to go ahead and basically
11:54 - just so let's open up the app
11:56 - dot css okay
12:00 - so i've got css and basically you just
12:02 - want to highlight everything
12:03 - and smash the delete button to just get
12:05 - rid of them smash the delete
12:09 - that's the new one smash didn't leave
12:10 - one for the egypt
12:13 - clever coder says you guys are awesome
12:15 - i'm gonna enroll in pwj
12:16 - soon i got all your projects on my
12:18 - portfolio now keep it up guys
12:19 - that is awesome man whether you join pwg
12:22 - or not
12:23 - our number one mission is to make as
12:25 - many developers on the planet as
12:27 - possible
12:27 - we have a bigger mission now exactly
12:30 - that's exactly what we want to do guys
12:32 - we're going to like
12:33 - get developers just like just learning
12:35 - this stuff having fun with this stuff
12:37 - like it's just a superpower once you
12:40 - start using once you know react
12:41 - you can just start building anything
12:42 - it's really really fun like it is
12:44 - awesome
12:45 - super sharp says i start loving coding
12:47 - because these new awesome people it
12:48 - makes coding
12:49 - interesting and simple that's the yep
12:52 - right all right let's keep on rolling
12:54 - so index.css is the next place guys so
12:57 - we need to go over to index.css
13:01 - let's go to index and i'll also follow
13:03 - you so i'll go here and hit follow boom
13:06 - there we go
13:06 - nice and then what we're going to do is
13:09 - we're going to add a magic rule here
13:11 - guys we're going to say for everything
13:13 - uh apply a margin of zero ola
13:17 - is here our boy yeah and he's like
13:20 - by the way nice photo you didn't have
13:22 - this photo before now it looks
13:24 - clean and he goes it's definitely clever
13:26 - programmer's definitely disrupting
13:28 - online learning and it's mind-blowing i
13:29 - guess youtube already noticed this
13:32 - hey you just joined the course
13:35 - whoa sharia says i'm in a coding
13:37 - bootcamp but i get so much value from
13:39 - your tutorials
13:40 - yo this is awesome i'm sorry guys we
13:41 - want to keep coding but these messages
13:43 - are so awesome we want to highlight them
13:45 - yeah it gets us pumped guys i love
13:47 - seeing this stuff
13:48 - some people are saying sonny and kazi is
13:50 - my favorite combo oh [ __ ] nice
13:53 - yeah this is that's what i'm talking
13:55 - about
13:56 - awesome all right let's keep it rolling
13:59 - so this is the magic line that you're
14:01 - going to need to do and basically
14:02 - the reason why we do this guys is
14:04 - because whenever you're doing html css
14:06 - javascript like
14:07 - just something to remember is that web a
14:10 - lot of browsers have this annoying habit
14:12 - of giving like us an invisible margin
14:15 - right so if we notice if i get rid of
14:17 - that rule look what happens invisible
14:19 - margin yeah so if i get right like if i
14:22 - get rid of it the
14:23 - browsers automatically apply that top
14:25 - much and they do that to everything
14:27 - so you're gonna start seeing like hang
14:28 - on i haven't put a margin here but
14:30 - somehow the browser's gonna so this
14:32 - basically just overrides that at the
14:33 - root and it says right
14:35 - don't do that let's just kind of just
14:37 - ignore that and just kind of
14:38 - uh have our own rule set so once that's
14:40 - done you can go ahead and close
14:41 - index.css and then we can pretty much
14:44 - head over back to app.js and then we
14:46 - have a good starting point
14:47 - yeah so that's really nice yeah so
14:51 - the next step is essentially i like to
14:53 - sort of draft out the app right
14:55 - so if we go ahead and open up the uh the
14:57 - app the sort of finished app
14:59 - so let's open up our build yep
15:02 - yep so in here guys we can see uh three
15:05 - main areas right we can see there's a
15:07 - header
15:08 - so in the code what i'm gonna do is i'm
15:09 - just gonna draft out as a comment so i'm
15:10 - going to say we have a header
15:12 - right we have a
15:15 - we have the the cards so the tinder
15:17 - cards which is huge
15:19 - by the way for anybody who doesn't know
15:20 - what a tinder app is because i see some
15:22 - people asking that
15:23 - it's a dating app so if you're looking
15:25 - to match up with somebody or a partner
15:28 - whatever it helps you match up and
15:31 - basically just swipe left and right till
15:32 - you find matches with each other and if
15:34 - somebody swipes right on you and you
15:36 - swipe right on them
15:37 - then you can start messaging them so
15:39 - just a dating app that's it
15:41 - exactly exactly
15:44 - so we have the header then we have the
15:46 - tinder card so
15:47 - that that's the area where you swipe
15:49 - left you swipe right
15:50 - um depending on who's sort of coming
15:52 - onto your account and then we
15:53 - essentially have
15:54 - the buttons at the bottom so buttons
15:58 - uh below tinder cards some buttons below
16:02 - tinder cards
16:04 - and then we have the other screens
16:06 - before we keep going so when you say
16:08 - header
16:09 - what are you referring to is that this
16:11 - part right there that i'm highlighting
16:13 - like where the tinder logo sits and the
16:14 - chat and the
16:16 - that exactly that yeah so that that
16:18 - would be what we're referring to as the
16:20 - header component guys because in react
16:22 - what we do is we build everything in
16:24 - components
16:25 - so the first one that we're going to
16:26 - build is that header component
16:28 - exactly okay cool so first thing is that
16:30 - header got it
16:31 - then the tinder cards is where that big
16:33 - image is with that guy's name on it yeah
16:36 - exactly okay cool got it
16:39 - and then so that's that's this guy right
16:41 - here guys so just to kind of visually
16:43 - draw it out
16:44 - this is what we're talking about and
16:46 - then the button below the cards are all
16:48 - these like
16:49 - icons at the bottom exactly
16:53 - exactly yeah so that's going to be the
16:57 - first thing right
16:58 - and then we're also going to have um so
17:01 - like just underneath what i'm going to
17:02 - write is we're also going to have a
17:04 - chat sort of screen right so a chat
17:06 - screen which is basically going to be
17:08 - the screen when you click on the top
17:11 - right icon
17:12 - yeah so if we go ahead and click on the
17:14 - top right icon
17:16 - for the chat icon so it's in the header
17:18 - then what will happen
17:20 - is it will go inside the chat screen so
17:22 - this screen will list out
17:24 - all of the different chats available or
17:26 - all of the people that you've matched
17:27 - with right
17:28 - and then when we click on that we're
17:29 - gonna have an individual chat screen
17:32 - right so individual chat screen oh i
17:35 - love that
17:35 - car that goes you guys are making me
17:37 - guilty for not paying for this
17:39 - way to go this is gold nice
17:42 - i love that awesome so i think you guys
17:45 - have a v8
17:46 - brain
17:49 - that's chat screen individual chat
17:50 - screen okay yeah so the individual chat
17:52 - screen is when you tap into one of those
17:53 - and you can see sort of the
17:54 - chat clicking into it yeah okay
17:58 - yes that's going to be that screen right
18:00 - there so we're going to show you guys
18:01 - how to build all of this
18:02 - right um something to bear in mind
18:04 - however
18:05 - is that we do have routing right so
18:07 - before we kind of get into all of that
18:09 - stuff
18:09 - i think let's just go ahead and start
18:10 - developing and start building that
18:12 - header out
18:13 - and then we can sort of see from there
18:14 - how things go right
18:16 - so the first thing we're going to do is
18:17 - in order to build this header component
18:19 - let's go ahead and build a new file so
18:22 - if you open up the
18:23 - um the left side so whether where the
18:26 - files are inside of vs code yep
18:29 - and let's go ahead and create a new file
18:31 - and let's call it header.js
18:34 - and since it's a component it's going to
18:36 - be capitalized got it
18:38 - yeah and also guys just a heads up
18:42 - we are actually going to be showing you
18:43 - how to use something called material ui
18:45 - which is a
18:46 - design library um i'm also showing you
18:48 - how to use material ui icons today so
18:51 - if anyone's excited about that smash the
18:52 - thumbs up button because that is pretty
18:54 - cool
18:54 - and you guys can use that across your
18:56 - projects yeah that will be beautiful
18:59 - yeah nice oh you did a little trick
19:01 - there causey nice
19:02 - hell yeah bro i remember oh hey
19:06 - so this is how we write our functional
19:08 - component guys
19:09 - all right so a functional component is
19:11 - literally just a function which returns
19:13 - some jsx
19:14 - jsx being some html with some javascript
19:16 - infusion in there so you inside these
19:18 - quickly brackets we can have some
19:19 - javascript
19:20 - yes you can just do anything inside of
19:21 - here um but
19:24 - what we're going to do here is basically
19:25 - just to get it tested and show that
19:27 - everything works we'll just do a html
19:29 - we'll say i
19:29 - am a header all right we'll save that
19:32 - file
19:33 - and then what we're going to do is we're
19:34 - going to go open up app.js so we're
19:37 - going to save this file
19:38 - open up app.js and then what we're going
19:40 - to do is we're going to go ahead and
19:41 - import so at the top we say import
19:43 - header
19:44 - from header so just to be clear and for
19:47 - the sake of repetition
19:48 - from header he's importing that
19:52 - component that we had
19:54 - exactly cool and we're going to be using
19:56 - it for that
19:58 - exactly so we wrote it here and then
20:00 - we're pulling it in at this point
20:03 - and then we are then that allows us to
20:05 - then go ahead and render it so where we
20:07 - had our little comment here
20:08 - what we can do is we can actually go
20:10 - ahead and write the component itself
20:12 - and this guys will go ahead and it will
20:15 - basically go into the site and go inside
20:16 - the header
20:17 - and it will pretty much just pop this
20:19 - exact thing so imagine like we're
20:21 - literally grabbing this
20:22 - and we're taking it and we're pasting it
20:25 - there like yeah that's a great way to
20:27 - think it yep yep yep yeah
20:28 - yeah that's really what's happening here
20:30 - so then that is pretty much what we do
20:31 - so
20:32 - now we can see it says i am a header
20:34 - which is awesome right
20:35 - yeah so you can see that it's visually
20:37 - been put on the screen
20:39 - so that's really really cool um the next
20:41 - step that we want to do now is kind of
20:43 - get it looking somewhat like
20:45 - the the what we see in the tinder app
20:47 - right so we can notice in in our build
20:49 - we had these two icons on the left and
20:51 - the right
20:52 - those two icons resembled one the
20:55 - profile picture screen
20:56 - and two the sort of messaging app screen
21:00 - so if we go ahead and open up our app we
21:01 - can see the two icons that we're talking
21:03 - about so
21:04 - we have the profile oh by the way we are
21:07 - at 860 live viewers
21:10 - guys we love your face for being on here
21:14 - that is so amazing thank you guys thank
21:15 - you guys because like seriously
21:17 - that hypes us up so much dude this is
21:19 - awesome
21:20 - i mean this is we're doing it for you
21:22 - guys um i love when all of you guys are
21:24 - on here and engaging and interacting and
21:26 - having so much positivity in the
21:27 - comments
21:28 - i'm not missing any comments so while
21:30 - sunny's building it and i'm
21:31 - working with him i'm seeing all of you
21:33 - guys comments you'll see me popping it
21:34 - up on the screen okay
21:35 - and pretty much nothing you're saying is
21:37 - being missed so if it's a valid question
21:39 - i'll bring it up later so feel free to
21:41 - put it there right now
21:42 - in the meantime smash that like button
21:43 - let's keep it moving
21:45 - exactly and guys we all see i have like
21:47 - the comments on my screen as well so
21:49 - don't ever think that we're not seeing
21:50 - your comments
21:51 - we can read them as we as they come in
21:53 - uh yeah that's awesome to hear
21:55 - all right so we just popped out the
21:58 - header
21:58 - which was awesome and you see in in our
22:00 - build right on the top
22:02 - um sorry in the final build on the top
22:04 - left and the top right we have this
22:05 - profile picture icon and then this
22:07 - messaging uh sort of icon
22:09 - on the top right right to get the icons
22:11 - we don't want to build those we don't
22:12 - it's just a headache to do all that
22:14 - stuff
22:14 - so what we can use is something called
22:16 - material ui so let's go ahead and head
22:18 - over to materialui.com
22:20 - yep okay yeah so if we google
22:23 - material ui and this
22:27 - is going to be like one of your best
22:28 - friends guys in terms of your design
22:29 - libraries
22:30 - so if we scroll down it will actually go
22:32 - ahead and it will show you
22:33 - um how to install this and all we need
22:35 - to do is run
22:36 - i think it's npm the command is there i
22:39 - think one sec
22:40 - material ui let me go ahead and grab it
22:43 - so it's npm install material ui
22:45 - call yep right here at the bottom yeah
22:48 - so if we can we can stop our build for a
22:50 - second
22:51 - and what we can do is we can go ahead
22:52 - and do npm install
22:54 - material ui core there we go and what
22:57 - that will do is i'll actually start to
22:58 - install everything
22:59 - into our project for us but do that as
23:02 - your first step guys and then i want you
23:04 - to go ahead and type in so if you go to
23:07 - um
23:08 - the search by material ui
23:12 - and you just type and so i think if we
23:15 - maybe oh usually there's a search bar
23:18 - yeah i think why isn't it look i'm
23:20 - clicking is this like a fake
23:23 - maybe if refresh i think it might the
23:25 - whole thing might have not come in
23:26 - properly
23:27 - there we go oh that's yeah there we go
23:29 - nice type in icons
23:34 - nice so the first one uh and yeah what
23:37 - we're gonna do here guys is you need to
23:38 - install material ui core first
23:40 - and then the second step is you see
23:42 - where it says the installation
23:43 - npm install material ui icons so we need
23:46 - to do that line as well so i'm gonna go
23:48 - ahead
23:49 - and run that in the terminal didn't we
23:51 - run that just now
23:53 - uh no we did we did material got it oh
23:56 - yeah we did core
23:57 - so core is the all of the components
23:59 - everything like that
24:05 - son you're you're you're all good by the
24:06 - way if i'm talking to frankie
24:08 - only he will here yeah cool yeah
24:12 - so um literally so that's what we're
24:14 - gonna do guys so we're gonna pretty much
24:15 - have it so that we
24:16 - install the material ui icons and that
24:19 - will go ahead and pull in
24:21 - all of these sort of icon sets so the
24:24 - reason why that's so useful guys
24:25 - is there is so many different situations
24:28 - where you're going to have
24:30 - um an icon that you're looking for
24:32 - whether it be like a search icon or like
24:34 - let's look at um on the right side can
24:36 - you see on the material ui
24:38 - right now he's got a bunch of different
24:40 - um icons there so like
24:42 - they have those icons in the top right
24:43 - right if we need any of those we can go
24:44 - ahead and grab them
24:46 - these ones okay these ones right here
24:49 - the top
24:50 - yeah so there's always a use case for
24:51 - like some new icons but if you click
24:53 - where it says you can see the full list
24:55 - of these icons
24:57 - right there yeah and this will go ahead
25:00 - and give you an amazing little uh icon
25:03 - picker
25:04 - so from here i would actually go ahead
25:06 - and bookmark this one guys
25:07 - um because this is actually going to be
25:08 - a really handy tool for you guys and
25:10 - let's just say right now what we needed
25:12 - we needed a
25:13 - profile right so let's go ahead and type
25:15 - in profile
25:17 - yep and you can see like it's found all
25:19 - the sort of profile ones right so let's
25:20 - click
25:21 - person and then it will actually give
25:22 - you the import line of code that you
25:24 - need
25:25 - so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
25:28 - i'm going to copy that
25:29 - and go over to how do i get it in blue
25:31 - versus black or is it
25:33 - just as simple as that yeah i think
25:36 - that's actually
25:37 - using something called color i think it
25:39 - might be color but there's a prop that
25:40 - you can pass in to get the different
25:42 - variants and sizes
25:44 - okay understood yeah so
25:47 - now we're inside the header so we can go
25:49 - ahead and
25:51 - that's it nice and now what we can do is
25:54 - we can go ahead and say
25:56 - that let's just pop in the um oops let's
25:59 - pop in
26:00 - the person icon so right here so if we
26:03 - do
26:03 - this now and let's open up our app and
26:06 - i'm just going to do npm start so then
26:08 - by the
26:09 - time we open up our app it's actually
26:10 - there nice
26:12 - yeah don't forget to npm start guys
26:14 - otherwise it will say like your app's
26:16 - not running and it might freak you out
26:17 - i would actually run npm start maybe in
26:19 - a separate terminal for you guys
26:21 - just so you guys have it but we're gonna
26:22 - run it and show you guys that step of
26:24 - cancelling every time so that way
26:25 - it gets very glued as do you need to
26:27 - restart it right so there we go
26:29 - you can see it's got the icon on the
26:31 - screen which is amazing
26:32 - it's exactly what we wanted um what we
26:34 - can do now
26:36 - is actually go ahead and grab the second
26:38 - icon which was a messages so if i go
26:40 - ahead and type in
26:41 - message i think the one that i used was
26:44 - the
26:45 - uh so you need there's a few so if we go
26:47 - to material ui
26:50 - uh material ui yep and we type in
26:52 - message
26:55 - in that box so there's a few here
26:57 - there's a chat bubble which is kind of
26:58 - clean actually
26:59 - um or there's like a forum so whichever
27:01 - one we can go with here so we've
27:03 - we've gone with the forum one this one
27:06 - questions and answers
27:07 - yeah so questions one that we check uh
27:10 - either or
27:11 - either or yeah okay let's pick the forum
27:14 - yeah so we got forum and what we can do
27:17 - now is we can actually go ahead
27:19 - and import that into our code so we can
27:21 - go ahead and import nice
27:23 - and then we can go ahead and pop it here
27:25 - so i'm going to check that one form icon
27:27 - like
27:27 - that and just to be clear guys i missed
27:29 - this actually but
27:31 - here's the person icon and we have at
27:34 - that added
27:35 - and then here's the forum icon that we
27:38 - have just added
27:39 - i know it's a little hard to see yeah
27:42 - so you can see like as i saved it it's
27:44 - all popped in there and now we've got
27:46 - those two things
27:47 - and then we notice how on the code i am
27:49 - a header is in the middle
27:51 - so you have literally you have the
27:53 - person icon at the top
27:55 - you have the item header and the second
27:57 - and then you have the forum icon there
27:58 - so
27:59 - we obviously this isn't obviously the
28:00 - ideal layout right now
28:02 - so we need to change that layout right
28:04 - we need to make that a bit more
28:06 - um sort of as a role as opposed to sort
28:08 - of
28:09 - by default it's something called block
28:10 - which it means it sort of
28:12 - stacks one on top of the other which is
28:14 - going to be a sort of
28:15 - annoying thing that we don't want so
28:17 - what we're going to do here is actually
28:18 - before we go ahead and do that
28:20 - no we will do that first we'll do that
28:21 - first so in order to get this working
28:23 - guys we need to
28:24 - first we're going to give this a class
28:26 - name so we're going to give this a class
28:28 - name of header
28:29 - and we use something called bem for our
28:31 - naming convention so i recommend
28:32 - everyone goes ahead
28:33 - and learns this because it's a really
28:35 - really handy way of naming your css
28:37 - variables and your class names um
28:40 - i'll leave that here yeah so we're going
28:42 - to call this header
28:44 - and then what we're going to need to do
28:45 - is we need to import
28:47 - something like this so header.css so we
28:50 - need to go ahead and create a
28:51 - file now called header.css
28:54 - so you can see it's freaking out because
28:56 - there is no header.css file
28:58 - so now what we need to do is create a
29:00 - header.css file
29:02 - so i'm going to go ahead and create a
29:05 - header.css
29:06 - file and we just should be popping into
29:09 - it right now
29:09 - so there we go so we have a header.css
29:13 - file and then you can see now
29:14 - we pretty much have the file imported
29:16 - here so every any bit of css that i
29:18 - write in here we're going to now get
29:20 - applied
29:21 - in here right and this way you keep your
29:23 - code very sort of componentized
29:25 - like and sort of isolate in a nice way
29:28 - so we have the header here so the first
29:29 - step we're going to do
29:31 - is you see we have these three children
29:32 - inside of here so if we go ahead and do
29:35 - header open close brackets and then we
29:37 - say display
29:38 - flex and what this will do is as soon as
29:42 - i hit save
29:43 - notice on kazi's screen as soon as i hit
29:44 - save it's going to put that that
29:46 - container
29:47 - into a display into a flexbox container
29:50 - it's going to change it to a flexbox
29:51 - container
29:52 - so as soon as i hit save it's going to
29:54 - by default flexbox pushes everything
29:56 - into a row
29:57 - so as soon as i hit save we'll see it
29:59 - goes into a row which is really nice
30:02 - and then what we can do is we can go
30:04 - ahead and do something like this we can
30:05 - say justify content
30:07 - space between and what this means is all
30:10 - of the children
30:10 - inside of it give them space between
30:13 - them so we'll have the two logos on the
30:15 - sides and then i am a header should be
30:16 - perfectly in the center
30:19 - and there you go which is really nice
30:21 - right so at this point that's very
30:23 - nice that is so easy it's clean right
30:26 - like it's super easy to get that up and
30:28 - running
30:28 - and at that point you're pretty much
30:30 - already getting like near enough to
30:32 - sort of like to uh the point of where we
30:35 - want to get to so
30:36 - dude i just i just had this idea what we
30:38 - should do is like
30:39 - make almost a cheat sheet of space
30:41 - between and justify
30:42 - content and stuff but like not a dummy
30:45 - cheat sheet like a real world cheat
30:46 - sheet so for example like
30:48 - um for example we have a cheat sheet
30:51 - where we have this image like this right
30:53 - here right
30:54 - yeah oh that would be sick see what i'm
30:56 - saying like
30:57 - actual app and then they can see and
30:59 - this is like flex you know
31:01 - space between yeah and then the amazon
31:04 - one where you built the header maybe
31:05 - like
31:06 - whatever it's there so i feel like this
31:08 - will give people an idea of like
31:10 - how this looks in real life yeah exactly
31:14 - and even like if we had the different
31:15 - variations for this one header
31:17 - so like space even the space between
31:20 - center
31:21 - shows you like exactly the difference
31:23 - what it's doing that'd be kind of cool
31:26 - nice okay so um
31:30 - what we're going to do next is we're
31:33 - actually gonna go ahead and give this
31:35 - a very subtle border right so
31:38 - uh so if i go ahead and add a border
31:41 - here so it's a border i'm gonna give it
31:42 - a one pixel solid and this is a very
31:44 - light gray
31:45 - right so just to exaggerate this i'm
31:47 - going to go ahead and do this so
31:48 - red and you can see as soon as i save
31:50 - this now you see there's like a red
31:52 - border right
31:53 - we're going to give it a very subtle
31:54 - gray because in tinder they have a very
31:56 - very subtle grey underneath it so
31:58 - you might not struggle to see this but
31:59 - it's a super super subtle gray
32:01 - right and and the more we build it out
32:03 - the more you'll see that
32:04 - um but then what we're going to do now
32:07 - is we're going to go ahead and add the
32:09 - tinder logo so the tinder logo
32:11 - is actually um so what we need to do is
32:13 - we go instead of saying i am a header
32:16 - what i'm going to do here is i'm going
32:17 - to use image so like this
32:19 - and basically ask for a source so in
32:22 - this case what we're going to go ahead
32:23 - and do
32:23 - is i've got a source right here
32:27 - for a tinder logo so we can go ahead and
32:29 - do this
32:30 - and just so you guys can see it in case
32:32 - you do want to use that i'll double line
32:34 - it so you can pause the video and see
32:35 - that
32:36 - nice so there you go all right so you
32:38 - guys can see that and you can make that
32:39 - single line and make use that link
32:41 - nice and then what we can do is in the
32:42 - alt tag so over here guys
32:44 - we can actually go ahead and type in uh
32:47 - we could just say
32:48 - tinder logo or something like that
32:50 - because you should always give like some
32:52 - kind of oh
32:52 - text right as soon as we hit save on
32:55 - that it formats it nicely and then you
32:56 - can see now
32:57 - in r1 we will have this huge logo that
33:00 - gets thrown in
33:01 - right yeah so if we open up um our app
33:04 - on the right
33:07 - oh cause we've got uh there we go so now
33:10 - um we should see okay so it hasn't
33:14 - popped in actually oh i haven't saved it
33:16 - oops
33:16 - right so now if i go ahead and
33:20 - let's see yeah so now we've got a
33:23 - massive
33:24 - tinder so we can't actually see it very
33:26 - clearly
33:27 - but there is a huge tinder uh icon on
33:29 - the right
33:31 - so oh yeah yeah
33:34 - huge right which means like obviously
33:36 - that's not ideal oh
33:39 - it's very good but we basically want to
33:41 - resize that and we want it to be a nice
33:42 - little neat icon at the top right
33:44 - so in order to do that this go ahead and
33:47 - give this a class name so that we can
33:48 - style it
33:50 - and here we can do i'm going to give
33:52 - this one a header and then in bem style
33:54 - and we say hello i want to take one
33:55 - comment here real quick so sorry guys
33:57 - some of your comments aren't coming
33:59 - through for some reason but
34:01 - we have a comment by elizabeth edelslin
34:04 - and she asks hey sunny is there a reason
34:06 - why you start your components as
34:09 - function or const which do you prefer
34:12 - and why
34:13 - right so function against const right
34:17 - yeah so what she means here guys is you
34:19 - can either write it as function or you
34:21 - can do like this
34:23 - right and this will actually do the same
34:25 - thing so this is the es6 way of doing it
34:28 - right so this is
34:29 - es6 and this is essentially what we call
34:32 - an arrow
34:33 - function right so i do like to write
34:36 - them like this so when i'm coding i
34:37 - actually tend to stick to this way
34:39 - because it's very neat um it's very
34:41 - clean
34:42 - but when we use some tools like we used
34:45 - a handy little
34:47 - um tool called um es7
34:50 - react snippets yeah and what that does
34:52 - is it actually pops in sort of the
34:55 - sort of pre sort of the pre-populated
34:57 - code for you
34:58 - but it actually goes ahead and does it
34:59 - in the old way which is this way so it's
35:01 - function
35:02 - now guys there's nothing wrong with this
35:04 - um except you just need to change it i
35:06 - think both are okay right as long as you
35:08 - stay
35:08 - consistent you should be good there's no
35:10 - massive benefit to one over the other
35:12 - but the more modern way is with the
35:13 - error functions
35:15 - exactly yeah and to be fair it's
35:16 - actually good to know both
35:18 - it's really good to know both yeah yeah
35:20 - okay got it awesome thank you
35:22 - so now what we'll do is where we've got
35:25 - the class name we do header underscore
35:26 - underscore and then
35:27 - the set after you have these two
35:29 - underscores you write the element that
35:31 - you're talking about so in our case
35:32 - header logo and guys you never nest so
35:34 - you never have three levels or
35:36 - like logo sort of like tinder or
35:38 - something like that you never do that
35:39 - so it's always just header the component
35:42 - that you're in and then the elements
35:43 - in our case the logo that is what we're
35:45 - talking about so
35:47 - we can go ahead and save that and then
35:48 - we need to style it so we go into our
35:50 - css we say header logo
35:52 - and now what we're going to do inside of
35:54 - here is we're going to firstly give it a
35:57 - height
35:58 - of 40 pixels okay now if i give it a
36:01 - height of 40 pixels
36:03 - we should straight away see it snaps in
36:05 - and it looks a lot better like that
36:07 - right looks a lot better but i just want
36:09 - to show you a little trick now
36:11 - say i was to say as a width of like 60
36:14 - pixels
36:14 - right now look what happens to the image
36:17 - right it's this you see that it
36:19 - distorted right so it really distorted
36:21 - it didn't it doesn't look too good and
36:22 - if i make this a bit bigger so 90 pixels
36:25 - you see it stretches out right if anyone
36:27 - ever runs into this problem
36:29 - there's a really handy little hack
36:31 - called object fit so if you do this
36:32 - object fit contain
36:34 - what look what happens now it will keep
36:36 - the aspect ratio while maintaining that
36:38 - size
36:40 - so if i do that look it doesn't look
36:42 - ugly and like yeah
36:43 - then now it looks actually really great
36:46 - yeah
36:47 - so that's a magic trick there guys in
36:48 - this case the height 40 does it
36:50 - perfectly for us but object fit
36:52 - is something which i always recommend
36:53 - you put
36:55 - yeah i'm just going to comment it out
36:56 - one more time guys so you can actually
36:58 - see what it does
37:00 - so let's actually comp oh yeah you might
37:02 - have to put a width
37:03 - uh let's put a width of like let's say
37:06 - 30
37:08 - width of like 30 pixels and you should
37:11 - see it distort
37:13 - yeah so guys take a look at that right
37:14 - this is important like this is a hack
37:16 - that he constantly like
37:17 - every build that we do talks about
37:19 - object fit contain
37:21 - but this basically just locks in the
37:22 - resolution so it makes sure
37:24 - it's like pixel perfect so now if we
37:26 - actually
37:27 - uh uncomment this out and save
37:31 - it actually starts to look pixel perfect
37:33 - whatever it needs to do to make that
37:35 - happen
37:36 - yep exactly so object phase and once i
37:38 - found out about this it was like a game
37:40 - changer
37:41 - like i was looking for something like
37:42 - this and it fixes so many different
37:44 - headaches that you always run into
37:46 - so definitely get used to using that
37:47 - guys um
37:49 - some things by the way guys this is
37:52 - amazing we just broke
37:53 - 9 000 views so thank you guys so much
37:56 - for that guys we're about to break 10
37:58 - 000 this is gonna be freaking insane in
38:00 - less than
38:00 - an hour so that's never happened before
38:03 - guys
38:04 - if you want to help us with this just
38:05 - please smash the like button and also
38:07 - just drop in the comments below that
38:08 - you're excited
38:09 - so we can hack that youtube algorithm
38:11 - send it out to more people thank you for
38:12 - being on here
38:13 - but sunny yeah go for it so much guys
38:15 - that's insane dude holy crap
38:18 - wow nice so i saw a question and a lot
38:21 - of people said why
38:22 - const why not let right guys just a
38:25 - quick heads up so when we do stuff like
38:26 - this when i had it as cons before
38:28 - the reason why is because khan says that
38:29 - like once you define it it's not going
38:31 - to change or you're talking about the
38:32 - same object so
38:33 - my rule of thumb is always use const
38:36 - until you need to use let
38:38 - right if you follow that rule it always
38:41 - just makes life easier so always use
38:43 - cons
38:43 - until you need to use that i love that
38:46 - this way
38:47 - yeah i love the easiest way of
38:48 - remembering that do you know what's
38:49 - crazy is that you
38:51 - told me about that always just use
38:52 - constant till uh you
38:54 - need to use let and when i go by that
38:56 - rule what actually happens guys
38:58 - is when i'm using const sometimes i run
39:01 - into an error
39:02 - and as soon as i run into an error you
39:04 - know and i'm like oh crap i'm actually
39:06 - changing this variable a lot like maybe
39:08 - i'm incrementing it or i'm like you know
39:10 - changing this array
39:11 - and then i'm like oh okay i need to
39:13 - actually use let you know and then i'll
39:14 - go back
39:16 - exactly and it protects you guys because
39:18 - it protects you against
39:19 - like accidentally changing things when
39:21 - you didn't want to change stuff so a
39:23 - really really good thing to incorporate
39:25 - yeah awesome so um what we're gonna do
39:29 - next guys
39:30 - is uh the per the icons that we imported
39:34 - actually allow us to uh add a prop so
39:37 - icons if
39:38 - you if a lot of you guys don't know are
39:39 - actually fonts right so whenever you
39:41 - talk about
39:42 - an icon you're actually talking about a
39:43 - font if it's a if it's a true icon
39:46 - and in this case they accept something
39:47 - called font size um
39:49 - in material ui so here what we can do is
39:51 - we they actually accept either large
39:53 - or small in our case we're just going to
39:55 - use large and watch what happens so if i
39:57 - add this here
39:58 - and i add this here and i hit save we'll
40:01 - see that the fonts
40:02 - so you see the icons actually grew a bit
40:05 - they got a little bit bigger
40:06 - right and it gives us like a very clear
40:09 - crisp one
40:10 - a way of using it um so that's a really
40:12 - nice little trick
40:13 - for you guys uh what we're also going to
40:15 - do next is i'm going to
40:17 - go ahead and give those icons so right
40:19 - now the icons are touching the side
40:20 - which i don't really like too much so
40:23 - instead of doing that what i'm going to
40:24 - go ahead and do
40:25 - is i'm going to give a class name to
40:27 - these two icons so here i'm going to add
40:29 - this class name
40:30 - of header icon to both icons you see
40:32 - this header icon header icon
40:34 - yeah and what i'm going to go ahead and
40:35 - do is go into header.css
40:38 - and style it and just go ahead and say
40:41 - that i want to give it a
40:43 - padding of 20 pixels so before i hit
40:46 - save on this so padding of 20 pixels
40:48 - before i hit save on this just keep an
40:50 - eye on those uh icons on the right so as
40:52 - soon as i hit save
40:53 - it's going to add a padding around them
40:55 - and we should see it
40:56 - now
41:00 - um oh i haven't saved it yet
41:03 - so now should a pop in
41:07 - i have done that right header icon
41:09 - header icon
41:11 - person class name
41:12 - [Music]
41:14 - let me go ahead and see what's going on
41:16 - two views away from hitting 10
41:18 - 000 views oh my god dude damn
41:21 - hey wow this is awesome and as soon as
41:25 - you find the fix
41:26 - as soon as you find the fix just jump in
41:29 - nice
41:29 - oh that's it we're good guys we just
41:31 - broke 10 000 views this is awesome thank
41:33 - you guys so much hey
41:34 - thank you so much we almost 1
41:38 - 000 uh thumbs up as well guys if we can
41:40 - get to a thousand thumbs up look i can
41:42 - see the number creeping up
41:44 - keep smashing it guys you're dead
41:48 - nice um right so the next thing guys is
41:52 - what we're going to do is
41:52 - so we actually added that padding and
41:54 - you can see now this is a very good
41:56 - demonstration of flexbox right so we can
41:59 - see that it added padding but
42:00 - notice how the image now isn't aligned
42:03 - on the horizontal axis
42:05 - with the rest of the icons right that's
42:07 - a problem because it doesn't look good
42:09 - so now what we need to do is we need to
42:10 - go to the header css rules
42:13 - and we use this nice little trick called
42:14 - align items and what this will do is if
42:17 - we do a line item
42:18 - center on the horizontal axis that's
42:20 - going to align everything
42:21 - cente central so now if i do that
42:25 - there we go well maybe vertical yeah
42:27 - always forget but yeah there we go so
42:29 - yeah it got it all straight on the same
42:30 - line
42:31 - and now that looks really crisp and
42:33 - clean okay so that's the first step guys
42:35 - and that's really nice
42:36 - and everything looks pretty sweet on
42:38 - that front so what we
42:40 - can do now is we can go ahead and
42:43 - that's actually for now that's actually
42:47 - no no one more step right the buttons
42:49 - right now so you see the
42:51 - two icons right now if we check out the
42:54 - one that we built kazi
42:56 - we can actually see here yeah so if we
42:59 - we can actually see when we click those
43:00 - you see that it has that nice clickable
43:02 - oh
43:03 - that little ah yeah that is nice
43:06 - so we want that same clickable effect so
43:08 - whenever you use
43:09 - icons um whenever you use the material
43:12 - ui kind of come up would
43:14 - come with that when you click yeah so it
43:16 - does come with that but it comes with
43:18 - that for buttons
43:18 - right but what you can actually do is
43:20 - you can take it up ahead
43:22 - yeah you can make it a button but
43:23 - they've got something really nice called
43:25 - icon button
43:26 - and what you do is you just wrap that
43:28 - around an icon and it gives you all of
43:29 - that stuff
43:30 - oh beautiful okay let's do so what we
43:32 - can do is to import it what we do is we
43:35 - just pull in this line here
43:36 - so maybe one said sunny would you swipe
43:38 - right on me i actually did swipe right
43:40 - on you that's how we met
43:43 - holy crap i did not know you guys met on
43:46 - tinder
43:47 - it was it wasn't tinder it was a
43:49 - different app called uh domo but yeah
43:50 - that's how we met
43:51 - it's crazy right yeah
43:54 - so here we've got icon button um right
43:57 - in there elmo
43:58 - what is that it's called dilmo dale mill
44:01 - yeah
44:03 - it's crazy huh it's like a south asian
44:06 - sort of stuff dang up ah i see okay yeah
44:09 - i
44:10 - heard of minder you know i haven't been
44:12 - there
44:13 - it's like tinder but for muslims oh
44:15 - really
44:17 - oh we should make dinner
44:20 - tinder but for developers i swear to god
44:24 - i feel like you just hit a million
44:25 - dollars
44:26 - only software developers allow dating
44:29 - each other
44:30 - yeah like proof of your github to get in
44:32 - you know it's like
44:34 - you use node instead of firebase like
44:36 - swipe left
44:37 - swipe left if you use node graph
44:42 - yeah c plus plus swipe left
44:48 - i've been super like you know yeah
44:51 - [Laughter]
44:55 - oh man oh that is actually golden
44:59 - that is i think we should build that
45:00 - there people would pay for that like
45:02 - they'd literally sign up for like 20
45:04 - bucks a month
45:05 - yeah it's actually a good idea holy crap
45:08 - nice
45:09 - so we imported
45:12 - we import we're gonna have a chat after
45:15 - this guys
45:15 - if you see linda come out at any point
45:18 - you know he built it
45:22 - so they're like loving it in the
45:24 - comments i see it oh
45:25 - sick someone said tinder tin dev
45:29 - oh that is nice
45:32 - yeah that's really cool in there
45:35 - nice so guys you see where we have the
45:37 - two icons right so this person i've gone
45:39 - here for michael what we can do now
45:41 - is we can wrap the icon button so icon
45:44 - button
45:44 - oops we can wrap that like this
45:49 - and what we can do is if i pop that in
45:51 - there and i'm not going to save it yet
45:53 - and i'm going to do this which is why
45:55 - it's not formatted the way because
45:57 - by the way guys if you're wondering why
45:58 - we get that automatic formatting it's
46:00 - because we use something called prettier
46:02 - i recommend everyone does it and it will
46:04 - make your life a lot easier
46:06 - so as soon as i hit save now you see
46:08 - prettier kicks in
46:10 - and we've wrapped the icon buttons and
46:12 - now what we'll see is you see it just
46:14 - got that light little gray overlay
46:16 - because it's it's automatically applied
46:17 - that sort of button
46:18 - style to it which means we're doing
46:20 - fancy
46:22 - and you get that nice little clickable
46:24 - you know a little floating riffle
46:26 - man i love that like that ripple is so
46:29 - nice like look at that
46:31 - oh yeah it gives you such a nice it's so
46:34 - satisfying like
46:35 - it's so satisfying dude like
46:38 - yeah okay really nice right so now what
46:41 - we're going to do is
46:43 - we've actually gone ahead and finished
46:44 - the header which is perfect so we
46:46 - actually did that really nice
46:48 - um let's go ahead and go to our app.js
46:51 - what we can do now
46:52 - is we can actually by the way on our on
46:54 - our tinder for developers people are
46:56 - jumping in and they're like i would
46:57 - invest
46:58 - in this idea uh and then somebody's like
47:00 - yo i was lit bro he's like i was
47:01 - literally talking to my friend
47:03 - about what app i should make with swift
47:05 - and we were joking about tinder 2.0
47:07 - with background checks yeah
47:10 - nice oh yeah i can see that one yeah
47:12 - nice tinder killed it
47:14 - dude i seriously think that's such i
47:16 - mean like oh
47:17 - we should we should do that we should do
47:19 - that one of our one of our bills we're
47:21 - gonna do that for one of our builds
47:23 - live yeah tinder and the next thing you
47:25 - see you see like
47:26 - 10 dev gets series c funding seriously
47:30 - would actually be like i think that's
47:31 - something we can just like stream for 12
47:33 - hours unprepared and i think people
47:35 - would love watching it
47:37 - yeah and that's something me and cozzy
47:38 - would do like we would actually go ahead
47:40 - and build stuff like that
47:41 - and yeah that'd be fun then we should do
47:43 - that with maybe
47:44 - with the react native yeah it'd be a
47:46 - cool project yeah
47:49 - nice so now what we can do is we can go
47:50 - ahead and let's go ahead and get rid of
47:52 - let's build the tinder clone up at the
47:53 - top so that way the header
47:55 - actually sits at the top so we save that
47:57 - now it's starting to look a bit more
47:59 - like an app so it started to already got
48:00 - that nice app filled to the top right
48:02 - um awesome so the next step guys
48:06 - is to actually go ahead and build i
48:09 - guess the tinder cards
48:10 - right but that but before we do that i
48:13 - think this is actually a good point to
48:14 - actually introduce react router right so
48:16 - at this point
48:17 - um if we so react router guys is
48:20 - basically
48:21 - going to allow us to have several
48:22 - different pages so we noticed when we
48:24 - built the app we when we click on the
48:26 - sort of messages screen
48:27 - you opens up the messages screen when we
48:29 - open up the um
48:31 - the individual chat screen you open up
48:33 - the chat screen right
48:35 - so in order to get that working in the
48:37 - in the way that we need it to
48:38 - we need to install something called
48:40 - react router right
48:41 - um so kazi let's go ahead and go over
48:45 - to uh react router.com
48:48 - cool yep so react
48:51 - router and i think it's the second link
48:55 - so it's not the github link oh yeah
48:57 - that's it that's the one this is the
48:58 - website
48:59 - yeah so if you could click on web um
49:02 - weird website
49:04 - yeah i know that's what's going on this
49:05 - is the nice sort of docs but then what
49:07 - you want to do is
49:08 - where it says npm install react router
49:10 - dom you just want to copy that line
49:11 - right so copy that line and then we go
49:15 - ahead and do mpm
49:16 - install reactor dom
49:19 - and now what i'll do is i'll pull in
49:21 - everything we need
49:22 - to handle the routing right inside of
49:24 - our app
49:25 - um so that's pretty much going to go
49:27 - ahead and do that and then once we do
49:29 - that guys remember
49:30 - run npm start to relaunch the app back
49:32 - up again
49:33 - but you can go ahead and look at the
49:35 - docs they have really good documentation
49:37 - on this stuff
49:38 - so let's go ahead and restart the app
49:39 - but what we're going to do is we're
49:40 - going to actually show you
49:42 - sort of all you need to actually get it
49:44 - running right so
49:45 - to actually get running now all we need
49:47 - to do is do
49:49 - let's go ahead and firstly we type in
49:50 - router right so oops i don't know why
49:53 - mine does that so we have ruta
49:55 - yo i actually love that somebody just
49:57 - said like on tindev
49:59 - instead of dates uh instead of like um
50:02 - their profile pictures it's actually
50:04 - their coding projects
50:05 - and you can take a look at that and
50:07 - match with them based on their projects
50:10 - yeah i imagine that someone else said
50:12 - bug fixing and dating
50:14 - so like you could you could either you
50:15 - could date them or you could hire them
50:17 - both exactly yeah i think it's got it's
50:20 - got potential dude oh my god how did you
50:22 - get material how did you get icon button
50:24 - wrapper from material ui sony
50:26 - i just imported it uh very good question
50:28 - i just imported at the top
50:30 - so you can see it there that's how we do
50:31 - that um so
50:33 - back to react router guys we have the
50:35 - router here which is basically like it's
50:37 - going to be the parent and everything
50:39 - else sits inside
50:40 - of this now yeah so imagine all of this
50:42 - stuff will sit inside of here
50:44 - even our header will sit inside of here
50:46 - right so we go ahead and save that so
50:48 - everything sits inside of react rear and
50:50 - then what you want to do is you have a
50:51 - something called a
50:52 - whoa whoa whoa man what did you do the
50:54 - whole the app is broken
50:56 - i need a refund i need a refund so what
51:00 - we need to do now guys is actually go
51:01 - ahead and import it
51:02 - so there's a little trick and i think
51:04 - let's go ahead and try the import trick
51:06 - cozy oh god your truth never works man
51:09 - that trick yeah look at that which
51:12 - looks like oh i think that's right no no
51:15 - hold on
51:15 - let's try it here all right
51:19 - ah it never works sometimes it works
51:22 - guys but basically all you need to do
51:24 - is i'm going to copy it in here so you
51:26 - this is what we're going to import
51:28 - yep import react wait hold on bro
51:32 - there we go there we go that's the one
51:33 - yeah
51:35 - so this is essentially what we need to
51:37 - import guys so
51:38 - here what we're saying is we're saying
51:40 - import browser router but we rename it
51:42 - as
51:42 - as rooter because browser root is kind
51:44 - of ugly right
51:45 - and then you've got switch root and link
51:48 - and these ones will explain it's like we
51:49 - don't actually need link yeah
51:51 - but these three we need right so that's
51:53 - awesome somebody just donated
51:55 - like a dollar ranit that is so awesome
51:58 - thank you and he says awesome guys
52:00 - 20k views soon hell yeah hey that's it
52:04 - awesome nice um
52:08 - somebody says any tip to optimize images
52:10 - oh i'll show you a tip in a later video
52:13 - if we get enough sort of people
52:14 - interested
52:15 - you can use firebase to handle that
52:17 - really nicely oh yeah yeah that's true
52:20 - yeah
52:21 - um okay so we've got the router and then
52:23 - what we're going to do now is we're
52:24 - going to go ahead and push in something
52:26 - called a switch
52:27 - right so switch now what switch does is
52:29 - i don't know why it does that
52:31 - right so switch or switches is basically
52:33 - all of your routes
52:34 - sitting here right so let's just kind of
52:37 - pop this uh
52:38 - outside for a second so i'm just gonna
52:40 - comment this over here
52:41 - i'm gonna push this outside for a second
52:43 - and even this stuff let's just go ahead
52:45 - and push this down
52:46 - here so we've just got a very clean
52:47 - layout right so you've got a router and
52:49 - then you have a switch
52:50 - and now you here you define something
52:52 - called roots so here
52:54 - that we would have one room which would
52:56 - have a path
52:57 - which says when your website is on the
52:59 - home page
53:00 - right so when your websites are when
53:02 - your website's on the home page
53:04 - basically go ahead and do this so say
53:06 - like
53:08 - so let's go ahead and say i am homepage
53:11 - right so i am homepage and then what
53:13 - we're going to do is we're going to copy
53:14 - this again and i'm going to push this at
53:16 - the top
53:17 - and you want to do let's say when we're
53:19 - on the
53:20 - chat sort of page i am
53:23 - the chat page for example right so now
53:26 - we have these two different routes
53:27 - and they were rendered two different
53:28 - things right so somebody else donated oh
53:31 - thank you
53:32 - so much nice oh wow that's awesome thank
53:34 - you for another donation a conch
53:37 - awesome sheila says sunny please show us
53:40 - how to deploy it to firebase we will be
53:41 - showing you that
53:42 - so stay tuned and we will be showing you
53:44 - that at the end of the video
53:45 - uh yeah so now we've clicked save so now
53:48 - you can see because he's on the home
53:49 - page right now
53:50 - right so what we're gonna if we go ahead
53:53 - and go to forward slash chat
53:56 - look what happens now so forward slash
53:58 - chat look what happens
54:00 - whoa it's like instant i'm a chat pag
54:04 - there we go i'm a japan yeah
54:07 - so nice so that's how we basically
54:11 - define roots guys
54:12 - and that's how different pages work
54:16 - inside of a react app
54:17 - right so that's actually what's
54:19 - happening when you do that um
54:21 - so at this point what we can do is neat
54:24 - little trick for you
54:25 - is if you want the header to appear
54:28 - on all of the pages what you can
54:30 - actually go ahead and do is actually
54:31 - just put it outside the room
54:33 - right and now regardless if you're in
54:35 - the chat page or if you're inside the
54:37 - other one
54:38 - notice how um so if we go now to the
54:41 - home page
54:44 - so if we go over to forward slash um
54:46 - just forward slash
54:48 - notice how the header stays there that
54:51 - is looking clean
54:53 - yeah so now you'll notice how
54:56 - because we put the header outside of the
54:58 - room it renders the header regardless
54:59 - and then based on the route it will
55:01 - render out the rest of the
55:02 - stuff right
55:06 - which is really cool that is nice so
55:08 - this allows us to just have the header
55:10 - pretty much everywhere so like this
55:11 - thing
55:12 - is going to be everywhere and then the
55:15 - stuff that's
55:16 - underneath it the body of the page is
55:19 - gonna be
55:19 - handled dynamically based on dude that
55:21 - is so clean that is so clean like
55:23 - if it slash chat it will do this here
55:26 - which is yup um if it's home it's gonna
55:30 - show you us this
55:31 - but if i put the slash chat then it's
55:33 - going to route
55:35 - oh that is that is just clean right and
55:38 - even you can go to a level
55:39 - of doing that inside components which is
55:42 - insane
55:43 - so even in components i'm about to build
55:45 - one right now
55:46 - live okay i'm picking this stuff up you
55:49 - know
55:50 - i'm i'm picking out what you're putting
55:51 - now let's do quasi
55:54 - i'm going to do yo quasi here
55:58 - fire emoji let's save it and now you're
56:01 - telling me if i do kazi
56:03 - oh man that is that is just so cool
56:05 - right
56:06 - i love it i love react so powerful and
56:09 - like it's so clean like literally and
56:11 - you have this nice like
56:12 - high level hierarchy of like where why
56:15 - things render but guys
56:16 - one thing to notice i think they fixed
56:19 - this in version six reactor
56:20 - but it's something which you guys will
56:22 - run into let's say i go ahead and put
56:24 - this route
56:25 - right so say i go ahead and put this
56:27 - route at the top
56:29 - yeah now even if we go to forward slash
56:32 - kazi watch what happens
56:35 - so let's go ahead and go over to forward
56:37 - slash kazi
56:39 - uh-huh like that
56:43 - now you see it says i'm a home page yeah
56:45 - you're wondering hang on but
56:46 - it didn't reach because imagine like
56:48 - code runs sequentially in javascript
56:50 - right so it's going to read this and
56:51 - it's going to read this and it's going
56:52 - to read this
56:53 - yeah it hits this and it's like okay i
56:55 - already rendered what i needed
56:57 - so you always want to have your default
56:59 - route at the bottom
57:01 - right and then you have your specific
57:03 - routes at the top so you always put your
57:04 - default at the bottom otherwise
57:06 - you'll be wondering like why is it not
57:07 - working and i've actually sat there in
57:08 - the beginning and spent ages debugging
57:11 - that makes sense okay yeah that's a good
57:15 - one guys that's
57:16 - that's an important one yeah so now what
57:18 - we can do is
57:19 - we can go ahead and we have the chat we
57:21 - have the home page um and for now we can
57:23 - leave this as the chat but for the home
57:25 - page
57:25 - oh we've got a header here perfect so i
57:28 - guess the next
57:29 - step is to actually go ahead and
57:31 - implement the react
57:32 - card right so the react card is the
57:35 - really interesting part now
57:36 - another donation by hacker street thank
57:39 - you so much
57:40 - really really appreciate that amazing
57:42 - dude yeah
57:43 - yeah i really appreciate it guys thank
57:45 - you guys now i don't feel bad for
57:47 - getting this
57:48 - starbucks coffee you know finally
57:51 - yeah right um so and now if we go to
57:55 - google and type in
57:57 - um let's type in react
58:00 - tinder card so somebody actually went
58:04 - ahead and built
58:05 - a card component which we're going to go
58:08 - ahead and make use of
58:09 - which um it's a really really nice way
58:11 - of doing it um and somebody went ahead
58:13 - and made a component for that and
58:15 - oh my god i just saw a 3d one as well oh
58:18 - damn i might actually go
58:19 - rebuild that and do it with that build
58:21 - it live
58:22 - yeah so yeah the code and the code looks
58:25 - pretty kind of clean too like
58:27 - on card left screen on swipe
58:30 - seems like it handles a lot of that
58:31 - logic for us
58:33 - exactly which is gonna be really clean
58:35 - really nice right
58:36 - so what we're going to do at this point
58:38 - is we just need to worry about
58:39 - installing it so let's go ahead and copy
58:41 - the install code
58:42 - so npm install react in the card
58:45 - and then we can go ahead and i'll just
58:47 - open up a new terminal here
58:49 - yep oh and i gotta make sure that icd
58:53 - not gonna be absolutely necessary
58:57 - but it always bites us in the ass at the
59:00 - very
59:00 - very end yeah it comes when we actually
59:04 - deploy
59:05 - because we would have been installing
59:06 - our dependencies somewhere else
59:08 - um nice so once we do that guys so while
59:11 - that's actually doing that oh it they've
59:13 - done that pretty quick actually
59:14 - yeah nice so now what we can do is we
59:17 - want to have all of our
59:18 - sort of tinder card logic in a separate
59:20 - bit i don't want this bit to like sort
59:22 - of get bloated out and have a bunch of
59:23 - code here right it's just going to be
59:24 - ugly nobody wants that
59:26 - so here what i'm going to go ahead and
59:27 - do is build something like this so let's
59:29 - go and have a
59:31 - tinder cards components or something
59:34 - like that right
59:35 - so what i can do is just i'm going to
59:37 - create a file called tinder
59:39 - cards and we're going to snap into it in
59:41 - just a sec so
59:42 - tinder cards so now we're inside of that
59:45 - file
59:46 - right and what i'm going to do is type
59:49 - in rfce so this is the es7
59:51 - syntax es7 snippets extension in case
59:54 - you're wondering how this works i press
59:55 - enter and it basically builds it like
59:57 - this
59:58 - and just to show you an example of how
60:00 - we can do it like this
60:01 - we can pretty much have it like that
60:03 - right we can have it like that as well
60:04 - but in this case it's very easy to see
60:06 - as function
60:07 - um so nice so here this is where all the
60:10 - cards are gonna live
60:11 - right so just to sort of get it working
60:14 - we could say
60:15 - tinder cards and then we can save that
60:18 - file
60:18 - go back to app.js and basically import
60:22 - so if i go ahead and import this one so
60:26 - uh oh that trick didn't work damn it so
60:28 - if we got to the top
60:29 - we say import tinder cards
60:32 - from tinder cards
60:37 - and then we save it now
60:41 - we can see tinder cars loads right so
60:43 - that's really nice and now all of our
60:44 - code is just going to live in this
60:46 - tindercards.js file which is much nicer
60:48 - than having
60:48 - every in one place yep nice
60:52 - so now we have the h1 here so instead of
60:55 - the tinder
60:56 - instead of having it like this what we
60:58 - essentially want to have instead is
61:00 - basically
61:00 - so you you'll notice in their example
61:02 - what they do is they actually have like
61:04 - an array
61:05 - right they have an array of stuff so and
61:07 - what we can do here is we can
61:08 - go ahead and do an array outside so
61:10 - let's just say const and let's just call
61:12 - it our
61:12 - characters when you say array what do
61:14 - you mean so an array is like a list
61:17 - no i mean i understand that yeah like
61:21 - what were you referring to when you said
61:22 - that they have an array array of like
61:25 - people in their array of like cards like
61:27 - what is it
61:28 - exactly so remember when we're swiping
61:30 - through those cards right
61:32 - we need a list to sort of swipe through
61:34 - so so we have like a list of sort of
61:36 - people to swipe through right
61:37 - got it so basically yeah go ahead so
61:40 - we're putting all of these people
61:42 - in an array with all their and is it an
61:44 - array of objects
61:46 - uh yes it's gonna be an array of objects
61:48 - and they're gonna have two things
61:50 - right they're gonna have an image
61:53 - got it got it you guys by the way do you
61:55 - guys follow that so far
61:56 - like that array is gonna need their each
61:59 - person's
62:00 - image and name so far so then we can
62:02 - like display the name
62:03 - and we can display the image okay that's
62:06 - what we're actually building right now
62:07 - if you follow that just drop it in the
62:09 - comments below exactly that
62:11 - perfect so guys what we need to do here
62:13 - is let's go ahead and use uh
62:15 - some state right so stay in react is
62:17 - like the short term memory i like to
62:18 - call it right so in this case
62:20 - what we're going to call it this let's
62:22 - refer to all of the people that you see
62:23 - as just characters right so in this case
62:25 - characters can be a very easy way to
62:27 - remember it right so the characters here
62:28 - are going to be
62:29 - uh we can just call it people let's just
62:31 - say people right so people
62:32 - and i say set people and this is
62:35 - basically what i'm doing here is i'm
62:36 - declaring
62:37 - a variable in the react way let's just
62:40 - just think of it like that right
62:42 - i'm declaring a variable so this is how
62:44 - you declare
62:45 - a array in react or any variable nice
62:47 - react
62:48 - yeah so you use state so basically
62:51 - this is the same this is i'm just going
62:53 - to keep hammering it till it's like
62:55 - clear in my mind and your guys's
62:57 - guys this is the same as literally
62:59 - typing in
63:01 - that yes exactly i'm just gonna leave
63:04 - that pretty much permanently there
63:05 - because like
63:06 - once you get this through just tons and
63:09 - tons of just brutal pattern recognition
63:11 - you will become insanely good at react
63:14 - like that is pretty much the same thing
63:17 - you know
63:18 - exactly that exactly that and yeah and i
63:21 - see some people saying well like that's
63:22 - what you're doing functional components
63:24 - yeah for now guys focus about functional
63:26 - components so whenever you see state or
63:28 - like or you state sorry or hooks
63:30 - then it's all we're always talking about
63:32 - functional components and also
63:34 - you might be wondering what set people
63:35 - is set people
63:37 - is always going to you the the sort of
63:39 - standard is whatever your variable is
63:41 - called so let's say in this case it's
63:43 - people
63:43 - your modifier is called set whatever
63:46 - your variable so set people in this case
63:48 - and what we mean by modifier is
63:49 - we never do this we never say so imagine
63:52 - we had
63:52 - cause this variable up here so cons
63:54 - people equals this we never do
63:56 - people equal something like this
63:57 - people.push um
64:00 - i don't know like abc right or like
64:02 - however you you never
64:03 - directly assign it instead you say set
64:06 - people
64:07 - and then here you would pass in an array
64:08 - or something or like this or you could
64:10 - oh yeah that's actually that's another
64:12 - good one let's actually leave those as
64:14 - comments so
64:15 - um leave your thing and i'm gonna do uh
64:18 - people dot push and i'll literally do
64:21 - the same thing
64:22 - as you're doing right there so i'm gonna
64:26 - leave mine both comment yeah we can
64:28 - comment that out right there
64:29 - so guys that's
64:34 - and we'll comment this out now like
64:35 - literally guys this is the normal way of
64:38 - doing it
64:39 - okay this is how you would do it
64:40 - normally or bad in this case and then
64:43 - this is the react way of pushing to the
64:45 - array okay
64:46 - i'll just put in parentheses push to an
64:49 - array
64:50 - in react yeah
64:55 - right and the reason why we use this
64:57 - this set people or set
64:59 - whatever the variable's called is
65:00 - because it tells react when you change
65:03 - the variable
65:04 - oh remember to re-render your the the
65:07 - component so that remember to
65:08 - to repaint the screen but reacts very
65:10 - clever it means that like if you change
65:12 - the people in that list or the people on
65:14 - those cards it knows then at that point
65:17 - to um to change uh to to sort of repaint
65:20 - the screen so
65:21 - it knows to update or refresh the screen
65:23 - right so in this case
65:24 - now what we're going to do is we let's
65:26 - say we have some people and inside of
65:28 - here
65:28 - we're going to have two objects we're
65:29 - going to have let's just say for
65:31 - simplicity let's have name
65:32 - let's have sunny and then let's have url
65:34 - and we could just do
65:36 - well let's just do characters here so we
65:37 - done um so in this case we had
65:40 - um let's just say steve jobs or
65:42 - something steve jobs
65:44 - these streams are awesome like i'm
65:46 - watching it every time
65:47 - i'm just becoming a better react
65:49 - developer like yeah
65:51 - it's crazy right like it's so crazy
65:54 - and then for the second person let's
65:55 - just have like uh let's say mark
65:56 - zuckerberg
65:59 - now here you have like the two names and
66:01 - then for urls we can go ahead and find
66:03 - like
66:04 - a picture of those two people um as
66:06 - reference so i'll go ahead and find them
66:07 - in a second
66:08 - but basically oops basically what these
66:10 - are going to do is the url is going to
66:12 - be the picture of that person and the
66:14 - name is
66:14 - is going to be what we're going to see
66:16 - right so that's basically our structure
66:19 - set up so these are going to be two
66:20 - cards
66:20 - in in in our array right so that's
66:23 - awesome now what we need to do is
66:24 - actually go ahead
66:26 - and pull that information into the app
66:29 - right so what we're gonna do is we're
66:30 - gonna say
66:32 - down here let's go ahead and say
66:35 - so we're going to do some jsx and we're
66:36 - going to say people
66:38 - dot map so we're saying loop through
66:40 - those people right let's loop through
66:42 - that list of people to that array
66:44 - and then for every single person so
66:47 - remember it loops through and it gets
66:48 - the first person and you output some
66:50 - information loops through gets the
66:51 - second person i'll put some information
66:53 - keeps doing that until you get to the
66:54 - end result and then here we're going to
66:56 - say
66:57 - return so normal parentheses as they
67:00 - return
67:01 - a tinder card right so a tinder card now
67:04 - you're wondering what a tinder card is
67:06 - we actually need to import it so let's
67:08 - go ahead to the top of the code up here
67:09 - we say import it's pretty important
67:11 - sunny so joshua says what does the
67:14 - parentheses dot dot dot mean
67:18 - it just means that keep whatever was in
67:22 - the state
67:23 - earlier and append to that that's all
67:26 - that means
67:26 - so it just says hey don't completely
67:28 - overwrite it
67:30 - put the initial stuff first so he this
67:33 - is what he's referring to you guys
67:34 - so i'm highlighting it actually i gotta
67:36 - move his comment because taking over the
67:38 - whole screen
67:38 - so yeah that's what he's referring to so
67:40 - it just means keep whatever is there
67:42 - already then add sunny to that and add
67:44 - quasi to that if sunny did not have this
67:47 - guys
67:47 - it would actually just overwrite the
67:50 - actual
67:51 - uh array that's we don't want that we
67:53 - want to have multiple people in there
67:54 - and not keep overwriting them
67:57 - yeah and that's called a spread operator
67:59 - and it's huge in es6
68:01 - uh so definitely definitely worth some
68:04 - red operation
68:05 - yeah and imagine it this way like
68:07 - imagine you had an array it literally
68:08 - just spreads it out so it spreads the
68:10 - contents out and in this case it spreads
68:12 - the contents out inside of our array and
68:14 - then we add sunny and quasi
68:16 - yup love it okay nice so we just
68:19 - imported the tinder card from that
68:21 - dependency that we installed earlier
68:23 - the second step now is we're going to
68:24 - use that tinder card so we're going to
68:26 - say
68:26 - tinder card like this oops then it got
68:29 - like this
68:30 - and then what we're going to say is
68:31 - inside of that tinder card
68:33 - let's go ahead and have a div
68:36 - so let's go ahead and have a div and
68:39 - that div
68:40 - is going to have a class name of card so
68:43 - this would say
68:44 - in this case we're just going to call it
68:45 - card we're not going to use bem
68:47 - just for this demonstration and while
68:48 - we're and what we're about to do right
68:50 - now
68:50 - is in our array we're going to have
68:52 - steve jobs show up for our card
68:54 - and then mark zuckerberg show for our
68:56 - card
68:57 - exactly so here what we can say is we
69:00 - can have like
69:01 - so the person's name will come up here
69:04 - right so
69:04 - basically to get the person's name here
69:06 - what we can do is we can just say person
69:08 - dot name and curly braces and that will
69:10 - actually go ahead and go to this person
69:12 - and it will access the uh the name key
69:15 - right
69:16 - and then what we're gonna do is we're
69:17 - gonna make it so that the div
69:19 - right so imagine we have a container we
69:21 - have the name
69:22 - but the div here is actually going to
69:24 - have the following so we're going to say
69:26 - it's going to have a style and the style
69:28 - that we're going to directly apply here
69:31 - is this is called an inline style right
69:33 - and what we're going to say is we're
69:34 - going to say it's got a background image
69:36 - all right background image and we're
69:39 - basically going to do
69:40 - something called string interpolation
69:41 - here and we're going to say it's a url
69:44 - right it's a url open close brackets and
69:47 - inside
69:48 - that url we're essentially going to have
69:50 - the person
69:51 - dot url and basically what this is doing
69:53 - is it's saying the background image is
69:55 - imag this is essentially
69:57 - changing the css through javascript so
70:00 - we're actually modifying the style here
70:02 - through javascript so we're saying set
70:04 - the background image of the container so
70:06 - that that sort of square box
70:07 - around sort of the person name to
70:10 - whatever that person's um
70:12 - whatever that person's url is so in this
70:14 - case we have got an empty
70:15 - i'm going to go ahead and grab something
70:16 - right now so steve jobs let me quickly
70:18 - grab
70:19 - a url for steve opponents guys you're
70:21 - going to be using camel casing
70:24 - yeah exactly so we've got i'm going to
70:27 - grab a picture for steve jobs
70:29 - and a picture from mark zuckerberg and
70:31 - guys you don't need to copy the exact
70:33 - pictures that we got any picture will
70:34 - work here but you just need to go on
70:36 - google
70:36 - and grab a picture so in this case we've
70:38 - got steve and we've got
70:40 - mark let me go ahead and grab that one
70:42 - so we got this one
70:45 - there you go any any photo will work but
70:49 - yeah you guys can
70:50 - take a look at which ones we're using
70:52 - and you can literally copy that if you
70:53 - want to but get your own
70:55 - yeah get your own photo are you
70:57 - following me still quasi i'm just
70:58 - wondering what was it
70:59 - i am now following you nice it wasn't
71:02 - following me for a second i think
71:05 - yeah so i'm just added those two
71:06 - pictures uh um so it's literally just
71:09 - let me take a look at this photo bro let
71:10 - me take a look at what you got let's see
71:13 - let's see if you're representing steve
71:14 - jobs the right way
71:17 - all right you know low resolution photo
71:20 - but it's all right i think that'll work
71:23 - yeah and then check out my mug fun
71:28 - all right let's check out this one right

72:09 - for being on here
72:10 - but please smash that like button if you
72:12 - haven't already subscribed to the
72:13 - channel and let's keep this thing
72:15 - going hey we just got another uh
72:18 - donation
72:18 - nice by monu sachiteva thank you so much
72:21 - i love this
72:22 - our chat revenue is i'm above 22.30
72:26 - right now i'm pumped awesome thank you
72:29 - nice thank you so much
72:30 - yeah um nice so now we have
72:34 - oh we just hit 1200 likes so
72:37 - we have the div and then we have the
72:39 - person's name right so that's really
72:40 - cool
72:41 - um what we want to do now is
72:45 - we actually want to go ahead and there's
72:47 - a few uh
72:48 - props that we need to pass inside the
72:50 - tinder card right so tinder card this is
72:53 - after looking at the documentation we're
72:54 - going to go ahead and give it a class
72:55 - name of swipe
72:57 - so just for reference we're going to
72:58 - come back to that in a sec classroom
73:00 - swipe and we're going to give it a key
73:01 - right and the key and are in this case
73:03 - is going to be the person's name
73:05 - right so in order to get the person's
73:06 - name we do this person.name
73:08 - reason why key is so important guys
73:10 - whenever you have any kind of list
73:12 - right any sort of list inside encoding
73:14 - you want to give it a key which is like
73:16 - a unique identifier
73:18 - for that item in the list and this
73:19 - basically allows react to
73:21 - cleverly in a smart way re-render its
73:24 - contents
73:25 - right so we need to give it a key and
73:26 - then so hold on i'm just gonna i'm just
73:28 - gonna write that out what you just said
73:30 - so always give keys
73:33 - in react and what's the benefit of this
73:37 - so it allows react to efficiently
73:40 - re-render a list right
73:44 - so allows react to efficiently
73:47 - re-render a list and this also so like
73:50 - in other words guys it also
73:52 - makes your app super fast
73:56 - yep yep now guys the reason why you
73:59 - might
74:00 - not see the benefit immediately is
74:02 - because you only have like 10
74:04 - 20 30 40 50 things inside there inside
74:06 - your list
74:07 - but let's say your app took off tomorrow
74:09 - right let's say
74:10 - dev ed uh like the dinder app took off
74:13 - tomorrow right
74:14 - yeah and we hit that yeah
74:18 - we had like a million users on there
74:20 - then suddenly
74:22 - you've got a million users and that
74:24 - slight
74:25 - decrease in speed suddenly becomes a
74:28 - huge decrease in speed right
74:30 - and say like you matched up with
74:31 - thousands of people because you're like
74:33 - an amazing person
74:34 - like you just you're going to see that
74:36 - speech the effect right
74:40 - what kind of projects are you developing
74:42 - bro holy [ __ ]
74:44 - you have some crazy get out dude
74:46 - [Laughter]
74:51 - i just donated 30
74:54 - dollars yeah dude no this is totally
74:59 - that's so insane but it's something
75:01 - thank you oh my god guys what are you
75:04 - guys doing i'm about to cry right now
75:05 - this is a lot blowing my mind dude oh my
75:08 - god
75:09 - i'm about to get it yo you know i'm
75:11 - about to take the money that we're
75:12 - getting from the chat and we'll just do
75:14 - a giveaway like a free clever programmer
75:16 - shirt you know yeah or like a tinder
75:18 - club
75:19 - tin dev shirt and we'll just
75:24 - tinder was created we should write the
75:26 - the date underneath the estimated
75:28 - whatever the day is oh man
75:33 - now amman says does a clean up process a
75:35 - news effect is necessary okay so we'll
75:36 - talk about use effect later
75:38 - on um very good question though they're
75:40 - calling us their react duo now
75:41 - apparently
75:42 - hey that's nice dude react to it's going
75:46 - yeah awesome and and by the way guys
75:49 - i'll uh
75:50 - another way to think about this right
75:52 - guys is if i go to
75:54 - instagram.com and i go to like one of my
75:57 - things right now if i'm about to make a
75:59 - comment
76:00 - on here and i hit like blah blah blah
76:03 - and i hit post now instead of it
76:06 - refreshing
76:07 - every single comment that's already on
76:09 - this post when i hit post it only
76:11 - posts that comment and it doesn't
76:13 - refresh anything else that's another
76:15 - benefit of using keys and react
76:17 - okay otherwise that won't happen exactly
76:20 - but
76:21 - what will happen is if you say you
76:22 - didn't put a key a lot of people might
76:24 - say like hang on but it's still working
76:25 - right
76:26 - that's where you get confused because
76:28 - it's not actually working at that point
76:30 - like isn't it it's working but it's not
76:32 - re-rendering it in the clever way
76:34 - and now trust me it does make a
76:35 - difference just rule of thumb
76:38 - always do use a key right
76:42 - so that's a nice example on instagram um
76:45 - so back to tinder card guys
76:48 - there was one more prop that's really
76:50 - important here guys and it's basically
76:52 - called prevent swipe
76:54 - right now prevent swipe is basically so
76:57 - the guys built this in such a way
76:59 - so whoever made this uh this component
77:01 - but in such a way that you could swipe
77:02 - left and right but you could also swipe
77:04 - up and down so like in
77:06 - in tinder you have like super like i
77:08 - think if you swipe up and then swiping
77:09 - down i don't think it does anything but
77:11 - in this case
77:12 - our app's going to be a bit simpler
77:13 - right so it's just going to have up uh
77:16 - left and right so we're actually going
77:17 - to prevent a
77:19 - up and down swipe so basically the way
77:21 - they they tell you to do that
77:22 - is you pass in an array of up and down
77:24 - and that will prevent you from swiping
77:26 - up and down
77:28 - look at this alexander's like npx create
77:31 - react app tin dev clone
77:34 - the race is on dude
77:38 - man i'm actually like i think we can
77:39 - start a movement with this but my bad
77:41 - keeps going
77:42 - dude yeah there you go nice okay so
77:45 - now with that said we've got those two
77:47 - things right now they also have some
77:49 - really other cool stuff like on swipe on
77:51 - card left screen but we're not going to
77:52 - touch on those
77:53 - uh just yet so with that said what we
77:56 - can actually go ahead and do is i
77:57 - think let me go and check on my local um
78:00 - let me see if
78:01 - it does what i'm thinking it does before
78:03 - we start it so okay yeah
78:05 - so now because if you go ahead and go
78:07 - over to your um
78:09 - your your local host
78:12 - so now you'll see that these are
78:14 - actually pictures right they're pictures
78:15 - but you can't tell probably so if you
78:17 - swipe left or mark zuckerberg
78:21 - look at that how clean is that bro
78:24 - yeah let me take steve jobs and swipe
78:26 - right
78:29 - that is nice you guys my mind is
78:32 - right nice who will pay for that app how
78:35 - many of you guys will pay for
78:37 - that app right there exactly that's
78:40 - that's tinder right there that's that's
78:42 - that's a backhand
78:44 - [Laughter]
78:48 - yeah that's for back that's the back end
78:50 - developers guys this is the app
78:52 - um
78:56 - they just have to log into their command
78:58 - line and they get they see the pictures
78:59 - and ascii
79:03 - it's just a console log of like
79:05 - somebody's face
79:06 - in ascii
79:13 - so this looks horrible at the at this
79:15 - point but i mean for a front-end
79:17 - developer it looks terrible for a
79:18 - back-end it looks beautiful
79:19 - so at this point we need to actually go
79:21 - ahead and add a css file so i'm going to
79:23 - go ahead and create another css file
79:25 - called
79:26 - tinder cards dot css
79:29 - right tindercards.css we're going to
79:31 - snap into that
79:32 - now and then what i'm going to do is i'm
79:35 - going to go ahead
79:36 - and import that so import tinder
79:39 - cards dot css there we go
79:43 - and now what we're going to do is we've
79:44 - actually got a bunch of things here so
79:45 - i've got a card i've got this swipe
79:47 - so i'm going to start going one by one
79:49 - so let's let's start with
79:50 - styling the card a little bit right so
79:52 - the tinder card if we go in here
79:54 - i'm going to give this a position of
79:57 - relative which means that it's now going
79:59 - to basically be relative to its parent
80:01 - so this is just a rule here that will
80:03 - help us out later on
80:05 - um so i'm just going to save that one
80:07 - and as we save it you'll see
80:08 - like things will slowly get reflected on
80:10 - the right right so we'll have that
80:12 - then we want to have a width of 600
80:15 - pixels let's say a width of 600 pixels
80:17 - save that wait i'm seeing steve jobs and
80:20 - mark zuckerberg at the same time now
80:24 - yep you will see them at the same time
80:26 - okay okay got it yep but for now you'll
80:27 - see it because remember guys it's just a
80:29 - list
80:30 - that we're returning those so that's
80:32 - actually the background images of the
80:34 - people but it looks like you can't
80:35 - really tell that at this point
80:38 - right so we have a width of 600 pixels
80:40 - and then we have
80:42 - a um uh let's just say a padding
80:46 - of 20 pixels so you want those to have a
80:48 - bit of padding between the certain
80:50 - between those cards so okay so it's
80:51 - starting to get a little bit better
80:53 - and then we say a max width right so a
80:56 - max width this will come into play later
80:58 - but i will explain it when we we sort of
81:00 - demo this later but i'm going to give it
81:01 - a max width of 85
81:02 - view it right so i explain that in a bit
81:05 - and also a height
81:06 - here so i want to give it a height and
81:08 - the height i'm saying is is 50
81:10 - view height so this is all going to be
81:12 - proportionate to how big your
81:14 - screen is so usually we use something
81:16 - called pixels which is a set height
81:18 - right but view height basically will
81:20 - determine
81:21 - based on the height of your screen or
81:23 - your device how big it should be
81:25 - right so you see in this case now if we
81:27 - have the let's have the app open on the
81:29 - side because it's the local host
81:31 - yeah oh whoa whoa nice you see that
81:34 - right so it's using like approximately
81:37 - 50 of the view height of your screen
81:40 - to figure out the sort of screen so you
81:41 - see like is that if you look at steve's
81:43 - one it's pretty much like 50
81:45 - is the height right yeah so that's how
81:47 - we do that and now i don't like that i
81:49 - can
81:50 - you know i can see like one of their
81:52 - eyes so that's pretty good for me to
81:54 - judge somebody on
81:57 - and then all the swiping functionality
81:59 - is still there everything still works
82:00 - really nice so
82:01 - the next step we want to do is add a
82:03 - little border radius to it so let's add
82:04 - a little border radius
82:05 - so let's go ahead and do that border
82:07 - radius and we that adds the rounded
82:10 - corners
82:10 - and then what we're going to say is a
82:12 - background size of cover and background
82:15 - position of center
82:16 - so i'm going to go ahead and pop these
82:18 - two in here and now as soon as i hit
82:20 - save guys
82:21 - look at this magic
82:25 - right so it actually went ahead and it
82:27 - made it so that it covered the
82:28 - background and then it
82:29 - centered it so obviously mark's picture
82:31 - is pretty dominant on the left side
82:33 - which is why even when it's centered
82:35 - it's to the left
82:38 - [Laughter]
82:48 - yeah he's gonna be like he's just one of
82:50 - those corner cases
82:52 - um but basically at that point we have
82:55 - everything looking
82:55 - much more much nicer at this at that
82:57 - stage um
82:58 - just to sort of show you guys in a very
83:00 - visual way i can go ahead and swap out
83:03 - mark's face for this
83:06 - and now there we go that's nicer right
83:09 - yeah that's a little bit nicer
83:10 - yep so then what we can do is we're
83:12 - going to add a little box shadow here
83:14 - because box shadows are nice everyone
83:15 - loves box shadow
83:16 - so let's add a little box shadow here to
83:19 - the card
83:20 - there's actually a really nice website i
83:22 - use sometimes for creating a box shadow
83:24 - oh i think i've used a few of the weird
83:26 - like they sort of allow you to sort of
83:28 - do the directions
83:29 - yep right here yeah so you guys if you
83:32 - just want to go ahead and you can copy
83:33 - that box shadow and that will pretty
83:34 - much give you like it's a very subtle
83:36 - behind it right it's very exciting i'll
83:38 - do is when we get it working i'll
83:39 - actually show you and get rid of that
83:40 - and it'll show you how that works but
83:42 - the magic here now guys is we pretty
83:45 - much have this like we have these two
83:46 - things stacked right so even if you
83:48 - swipe off of steve jobs
83:49 - mark will come up right yeah so by the
83:51 - way guys if you're enjoying this so far
83:53 - drop a comment below and let us know
83:54 - that you're enjoying this okay let's
83:56 - keep the energy up so then that way you
83:58 - can also learn a lot better
83:59 - the more you are engaged the more you're
84:01 - actually going to retain
84:02 - so if you feel yourself kind of like
84:04 - weaning off whether you're watching a
84:06 - replay or watching right now live as
84:08 - we're here with you
84:09 - if you feel yourself like stand up if
84:11 - you need to like
84:12 - literally actually physically stand up
84:14 - right now you know
84:15 - grab a glass of water or just like stand
84:18 - up move your body
84:19 - sit back down and have a good posture
84:21 - that's gonna allow you to just focus
84:23 - in a much much deeper level and drop it
84:26 - in the comments below that you're ready
84:27 - to go
84:28 - okay because we got a long way to go but
84:30 - i want to make sure that all this
84:32 - information actually stays
84:33 - with you so you don't have to feel like
84:35 - you're watching this
84:36 - four hours five hours again and again
84:39 - and it just doesn't retain
84:41 - this way it will retain forever okay so
84:42 - get your body a little bit more alert
84:45 - drop it in the comments below and let's
84:46 - keep going exactly and if you're
84:48 - enjoying it guys smash the thumbs up
84:50 - button
84:50 - yes do that as well awesome so
84:53 - that's um yes so now we actually have we
84:56 - have steve and we have mark sitting
84:57 - there
84:58 - over there right but that's not how
84:59 - tinder looks right they don't all come
85:01 - on the screen at once
85:02 - so what we need to do at this point is
85:05 - we actually need to go ahead and
85:08 - what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead
85:10 - and basically
85:11 - wrap our um our
85:14 - sort of tinder cards inside of a
85:17 - um inside of a so let's call it tinder
85:21 - cards inside of a container and let's
85:23 - call it
85:23 - card container right so i'm just going
85:25 - to create a card container
85:27 - and i'm going to basically pop all of
85:28 - the cards all the tinder cards inside of
85:30 - that container
85:32 - all right so the reason for this is
85:34 - because i'm now going to style this card
85:35 - container and i'm going to apply some
85:37 - rules to it right so i'm going to go
85:38 - ahead and say
85:39 - that the card container so that card
85:42 - container
85:43 - should have display flex so display flex
85:47 - which means that by default it should go
85:48 - into a row so now mark should go to the
85:51 - right
85:51 - as opposed to being underneath right
85:53 - we're going to say justify contents on
85:55 - the center
85:57 - so it will always sort of center the
85:59 - value right
86:00 - and then what i'm going to say is so now
86:03 - you can see like it looks
86:04 - broken at this point because it's like
86:05 - hang on like i've got mark on and
86:07 - i've got both of them in the center like
86:08 - carzi if you go ahead and you
86:11 - swipe on um so swipe on
86:14 - one person here so swipe on one of them
86:17 - yeah and notice how much oh
86:18 - nice yeah so he is already like sort of
86:21 - centered at this point right
86:23 - but we have this sort of problem of
86:26 - having both on the screen at one time
86:28 - right so i'm going to add a little
86:30 - margin here of 10 view height so again
86:32 - it's going to be dependent on how big
86:33 - the screen is
86:35 - i'm going to add a small view height
86:36 - here let's go ahead and make that a
86:37 - little bit more gentle
86:38 - so let's just say five view height for
86:40 - now so five if you hire there we go
86:43 - and now what we're going to do is this
86:45 - is where the magic happens guys so
86:47 - the card so if we notice that when we
86:50 - made this card we gave
86:52 - the tinder card a class name of swipe
86:54 - right
86:56 - so i'm going to go ahead and style this
86:58 - and say swipe
87:00 - and then what i'm going to say is
87:01 - position
87:03 - absolute right now what absolute does
87:07 - is what i'm going to do is firstly
87:09 - before we do this i'm actually going to
87:10 - go ahead and because if you refresh your
87:12 - page before we save this
87:14 - yep done yeah so guys notice how
87:17 - there are two things on the right right
87:19 - so there is uh
87:20 - mark and steve right they're both there
87:22 - um but as soon as i do this
87:24 - so now i'm saying set the position of
87:26 - this the cards
87:27 - not to be the default but to be absolute
87:30 - positioning right
87:31 - that means that it's going to be
87:33 - absolutely so then what we're doing is
87:34 - we're actually stacking them on top of
87:36 - each other
87:37 - right so now if i do this and i save it
87:41 - yep did you notice how they basically
87:44 - went behind each other and then
87:46 - wow actually nice yeah they went behind
87:49 - each other
87:49 - and then because they were actually
87:51 - center positioned it made it so that
87:53 - they
87:54 - all go by that is that is really really
87:56 - cool
87:57 - that is awesome right yeah so you get a
88:00 - really clean experience sir
88:02 - and everything works in a really nice
88:03 - way um
88:05 - so that's actually the way a few things
88:08 - i just want to highlight thank you guys
88:10 - you guys are loving it i'm seeing your
88:12 - all your guys's comments so like
88:14 - elizabeth is like yes this is awesome so
88:16 - hail is like broke amazing work loving
88:18 - the way you guys explain
88:20 - um so yeah i mean and then um i will
88:23 - butcher this
88:25 - i'll butcher this name but oh la even he
88:27 - was like i'm
88:28 - pumped and people are like i'm trying
88:30 - not they're like no sign of sleep here
88:33 - you know they're like we're ready to go
88:34 - so guys awesome i just see this right
88:36 - now because i see the dip
88:37 - happening and i know that that's where
88:39 - the energy is going down
88:40 - so i just want to make sure we bring
88:42 - that right back up so that's why
88:44 - sometimes
88:44 - boom i just connect with you and yes i'm
88:46 - looking at you because if you chat
88:48 - right now i will actually look at it
88:49 - sometimes you'll see me put my head down
88:51 - it's because i'm actually reading your
88:54 - chat and actually trying to respond
88:56 - or answer it later or bring it up on the
88:58 - screen so if you guys engage there we'll
89:00 - definitely see it
89:02 - but again thanks for actually engaging
89:04 - and putting your energy into it
89:06 - you will retain just so much more okay
89:08 - so we really want to make sure that
89:10 - understanding is there as we keep going
89:12 - exactly and guys we are always watching
89:14 - those comment sections so never ever
89:16 - think that your comment is ignored
89:18 - every single one that you guys post drew
89:20 - is motivating and it brings us up and it
89:22 - keeps
89:22 - it's what keeps us going for these like
89:24 - long live sessions
89:25 - so um we love it guys and we really
89:27 - appreciate you guys watching and being
89:28 - here
89:30 - um nice so now what we want to do is
89:33 - guys
89:33 - so we have mark and we have um we have
89:36 - mark and we have
89:38 - steve like perfectly aligned they're
89:40 - looking like good in this sort of view
89:41 - right but
89:42 - what we need to do now is actually go
89:44 - ahead and fix the text
89:46 - the text doesn't look good right you
89:47 - can't even see it at the moment so at
89:49 - this point
89:50 - what we want to do is we want to change
89:52 - it so that we firstly
89:53 - the way we do that is we say we go to
89:56 - our code and we say go to the card
89:58 - and say where is h3 so where there is a
90:01 - direct chart which is a h3
90:03 - so the reason why we're doing that is
90:04 - because here we have the card
90:06 - here and we're saying the direct charge
90:08 - is a h3 so you're saying where the name
90:10 - is
90:11 - we're going to go ahead and say it's
90:12 - position absolute
90:14 - so absolute means that we can basically
90:16 - position it wherever we want right we're
90:18 - going to say
90:18 - it's going to be 10 pixels from the
90:21 - bottom
90:22 - right so in this case because it's what
90:23 - absolute positioning i think 10 should
90:25 - work
90:26 - and then we're going to say it's color
90:28 - and then we're going to say
90:29 - it should be white right so if i save
90:31 - that let's go ahead and see if that
90:33 - works first time
90:34 - is that going to work so i think we need
90:35 - to do 10 pixels from the bottom
90:38 - and there we go so now we can see mark
90:40 - zuckerberg at the bottom
90:42 - right and if we go ahead and swipe again
90:44 - you can see steve jobs is now at the
90:46 - bottom
90:47 - so you can see like we started to get it
90:49 - already looking a bit like tindo right
90:50 - and it's starting to look very very nice
90:52 - and very very clean all right so
90:55 - we then want to go ahead
90:58 - and do um let me just double check we
91:01 - have info tags okay nice
91:03 - right so that actually believe it or not
91:06 - is actually the tinder cards
91:08 - pretty much at this point done so like
91:10 - that's actually a really really
91:11 - nice simple implementation to get that
91:13 - working um
91:14 - but we don't just we don't just finish
91:17 - there guys i'm going to show you now
91:19 - how instead of pulling it from our code
91:22 - how can we pull this from firebase
91:24 - because hey firebase
91:26 - let's go
91:29 - i'm going to pull from like hard written
91:30 - code it's going to be pulling from
91:32 - firebase
91:32 - and we're going to have a balance here
91:34 - to sort of show you how you can do that
91:36 - and take this a step further
91:37 - so with that said what we need to do is
91:40 - uh remember that config file that we
91:42 - pulled earlier kazi
91:43 - yeah we're gonna need that right now so
91:46 - what we're gonna do is
91:47 - we're gonna go ahead and create a file
91:50 - called
91:50 - firebase.js
91:53 - right so we're gonna go ahead and create
91:55 - a file called firebase.js
91:57 - and now what we need to do is we
92:00 - actually need to go ahead so that's
92:02 - exactly the conflict
92:03 - so i'm gonna i'm gonna show you guys
92:04 - where i got it from because i know it's
92:06 - been a long time since we were actually
92:08 - right there
92:09 - so i am in my app right now guys and um
92:14 - basically go down here and actually let
92:17 - me actually show you the url
92:18 - oh actually that url probably will not
92:20 - help you at all uh but
92:21 - here's the config file and this is where
92:24 - i grab it from
92:25 - and then boom we just pop it in right
92:27 - there okay this is going to contain all
92:29 - the information to your database
92:31 - your project all of that so make sure
92:33 - that you have found
92:34 - that part of the project where we
92:36 - actually show you how to host the app on
92:37 - firebase
92:38 - exactly oh nice kidus [ __ ] said
92:42 - watching this for one hour helps me more
92:44 - than a 10 hour video that's amazing
92:47 - whoa whoa that is awesome let me see if
92:49 - i can actually put that up on the
92:52 - screen i can't find that comment but
92:54 - that is awesome thank you oh yeah
92:56 - thank you so much um nice so guys before
92:59 - we
92:59 - we do that now we need to open up the
93:01 - terminal and do something uh
93:02 - do the following you need to say npm
93:04 - install so i can't actually edit this
93:06 - terminal so let me request rewrite
93:08 - access
93:09 - it's done yep so now if you press
93:12 - command j to pull it up
93:14 - so your mpmi um
93:18 - command j yep there we go npm i and then
93:20 - we say firebase so that what this is
93:22 - going to do is going to install firebase
93:23 - into the project pull in all the
93:25 - dependencies that we need
93:26 - and that will sort of allow us to use
93:29 - firebase inside of our app
93:30 - while that installs let's go over to
93:33 - firebase.js
93:34 - so what cars you did here is perfect so
93:36 - you just want to pull in your firebase
93:37 - config
93:38 - and then what you want to do is you want
93:39 - to before that you just need to do the
93:42 - following you say import firebase from
93:44 - firebase
93:45 - and then we have a magic sort of line so
93:46 - we have a magic line here so we have
93:48 - constant it says firebase let's just go
93:50 - ahead and call it firebase app so
93:52 - firebase app
93:53 - and then what we say is we say firebase
93:55 - because we're talking to we're talking
93:56 - about the one that we just pulled in
93:57 - firebase
93:58 - dot and then we say dot initialize
94:01 - app right initialize app so here we say
94:03 - initialize app
94:05 - and that's like a function that firebase
94:06 - gives us and then basically here
94:09 - all we do guys is pass in the firebase
94:12 - config
94:13 - so like that right so we're just passing
94:16 - the firebase config
94:17 - and it's super clean right so super
94:19 - super clean and then what we can do is
94:21 - the next step is we say const database
94:25 - equals and then here all we need to do
94:27 - is say firebase app so we're basically
94:28 - gonna
94:29 - we're referring to this one firebase app
94:31 - and we say
94:32 - dot firestore now if you're wondering
94:34 - what firestore is it's the real-time
94:36 - um the sort of the newer real-time
94:38 - database that firebase offers
94:40 - and that's how we access it so with that
94:43 - said
94:43 - that is literally everything we need to
94:45 - get the database up and running right so
94:47 - what we need to do now is to make sure
94:49 - that we can use the database outside of
94:50 - this file
94:51 - is to say export default database
94:55 - and yep so this is a this is an
94:57 - important thing in react
94:59 - guys you always want to make sure you're
95:00 - exporting the
95:02 - variable that you need access to later
95:04 - and you can then use it in different
95:06 - files whether he uses in header.js or
95:08 - app.js
95:09 - just remember exporting it at some point
95:11 - whether it's a component or whatever
95:13 - you're going to need access to it
95:15 - exactly and somebody just dropped 50 um
95:21 - that is amazing now the chat revenue is
95:23 - over four dollars
95:24 - i love it thank you guys amazing nice
95:28 - so we have uh x4 yeah default database
95:31 - so that's
95:32 - they dropped it and they said uh it was
95:35 - rene renee drops the
95:37 - he dropped the donation and then he also
95:38 - said finally firebase
95:40 - yeah amazing nice so guys this is like
95:44 - the magic point where we connected
95:46 - firebase to react so
95:48 - really really important point here right
95:49 - so this is actually sort of and this is
95:51 - so
95:51 - simple guys as in like it's it's
95:53 - literally the simplest implementation
95:55 - that you're gonna find
95:56 - with connecting react to firebase uh
95:58 - i've tried to look for simpler you just
96:00 - this is the easiest way to do it right
96:02 - so um once you have this up and running
96:04 - that's pretty much everything you need
96:05 - to get set so let's go ahead and
96:08 - head over to firebase now quasi yeah
96:12 - and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
96:14 - go ahead and create
96:16 - uh so we need to go to database on the
96:18 - left
96:20 - and we need to click on firestore
96:26 - i want to open them yeah so we're going
96:28 - to now be building our database to
96:30 - what to store the messages or store the
96:33 - cards
96:33 - no so we're not going to store messages
96:35 - we're going to demo how we can store the
96:38 - codes i see yeah because all of these
96:40 - people that are here
96:41 - they're actually stored in a database
96:43 - right now right in real time
96:45 - yeah exactly got it right and what we're
96:48 - going to show you is we're going to show
96:49 - you a mix of sort of hard-coded stuff
96:51 - and
96:52 - firebase stuff so that you guys can then
96:54 - get both sides of the skills and sort of
96:55 - like
96:56 - move that move from there if you want to
96:58 - build on top of it
96:59 - so um let's see what happens here so
97:02 - it's thinking unusually we're almost at
97:05 - five dollars and the donation let's
97:07 - go we're ten cents away from hitting
97:11 - five dollars you guys let's go guys
97:14 - i don't know there's something about
97:16 - this there's something about the chat
97:18 - five dollars that's
97:20 - honestly feels more than like five
97:22 - thousand dollars i don't know
97:24 - yeah i know i know it's like you feel
97:26 - like you earned it
97:27 - yeah well guys
97:29 - [Laughter]
97:31 - um what's happening here so then maybe
97:34 - if we refresh again
97:35 - okay let's see yeah okay all right let
97:38 - me
97:38 - just go ahead and log in right so
97:42 - what we're going to do now is we are
97:43 - basically going to so there is a
97:45 - nice firebase database called firestore
97:48 - right and what it does is
97:49 - it has this sort of collection document
97:52 - collection structure to it
97:53 - and what we're basically going to be
97:54 - doing here is essentially
97:58 - creating a collection of people
98:01 - and inside of those inside of this well
98:03 - so i'll show you now so what we do is we
98:05 - hit go ahead and create database
98:07 - click start in test mode make sure you
98:08 - click start in test mode
98:10 - um yep start test mode and then click
98:14 - next perfect and then you can choose any
98:18 - location here google's fast enough to
98:21 - sort of make it super quick
98:23 - and then what we can do is once it
98:26 - starts up we'll actually see the
98:27 - collection
98:28 - document view and what we're going to do
98:30 - is once that comes up we're going to
98:32 - create a new collection
98:34 - of people right so it's literally as
98:36 - easy as it sounds so it's a collection
98:38 - of people
98:39 - and inside of there you're going to have
98:40 - a bunch of documents which is going to
98:42 - refer to each of the individual
98:44 - people all right and then as we done in
98:46 - our code earlier we had
98:48 - name url name url that sort of format
98:50 - we're going to go ahead and do that
98:52 - in um inside of this new database so we
98:55 - have start collection let's go ahead and
98:57 - click that
99:00 - and let's type in people
99:05 - right so people and let's click and uh
99:07 - you can just click on auto id there
99:09 - and then so field can be a name
99:15 - name and let's type in um let's do
99:18 - should we do somebody new so we can see
99:20 - that it's pulling from new sure
99:22 - let's do yes let's do ellen
99:30 - yeah and then a add a field and let's do
99:32 - url
99:34 - so add field and then url uh-huh
99:37 - and then we're gonna do um so this one
99:39 - you can leave blank for now
99:41 - actually no no don't don't don't who do
99:43 - you who do you guys want to see next
99:45 - let's take some people from you guys
99:47 - your suggestions and we'll add them in
99:48 - here
99:49 - exactly yeah let us know guys so i'm
99:51 - gonna find an image for you and i'll
99:53 - drop the link
99:54 - inside of for elon musk right
99:57 - yeah got it okay so i dropped in the
100:01 - firebase config file
100:02 - boom and i got it bro we're fast i loved
100:05 - it
100:07 - yeah guys let us know who you want as
100:09 - the second person on our
100:11 - uh tin dev profile
100:19 - save and then what you'll see now is it
100:21 - created a people collection
100:23 - with the first documents of the first
100:25 - person with the name of elon musk and
100:27 - the url with his picture
100:29 - so we can actually go ahead and connect
100:31 - to that right so what we'll do is we'll
100:33 - start building it
100:34 - so somebody said zayn malik oh
100:37 - nice nice yeah okay
100:40 - there's george hot you got because they
100:43 - might like george
100:45 - i think if you took both of us and kind
100:47 - of combined us we get zayn malik
100:50 - yeah yeah it's so funny because we
100:53 - forgot that we're actually building
100:54 - tinder which means we're swiping on guys
100:56 - here right now oh yeah that's true
100:58 - yeah all right so um see so we have
101:01 - stephen hawking okay nice
101:02 - oh somebody said aaron burnett

101:23 - yeah okay awesome let's do that
101:27 - so we've got jeff bezos uh all right so
101:30 - jeff
101:30 - so the next one so inside of firebase
101:34 - yo guys we're about to break 20 000
101:36 - views i'm about to lose my goddamn mind
101:38 - what is happening this has never
101:40 - happened
101:42 - holy crap guys we're at 19
101:47 - 483 views
101:49 - um the best way you can help besides
101:52 - opening it up on your phone
101:54 - or something uh which would be cheating
101:56 - so let's not do it that way
101:57 - but just like it if you haven't liked it
101:59 - already because that's gonna spread it
102:00 - out to more people but guys we're so
102:02 - close to
102:03 - breaking 2000 this is something we have
102:05 - never
102:06 - in our history of channel been able to
102:08 - do before on a live stream you guys
102:10 - this is awesome thank you guys thank you
102:13 - so much guys
102:14 - amazing
102:19 - um because you go to
102:22 - firebase and create another
102:25 - document so another document got it auto
102:29 - id
102:29 - yes your id name would be uh jeff bezos
102:33 - yeah and you got the links yep
102:36 - you'll get none
102:40 - shall get those yeah you should get a
102:43 - gnosis image at some yeah and then drop
102:44 - it in here
102:49 - but all right we got
102:52 - yeah yeah you should you definitely
102:54 - should he's also on tinder right now and
102:56 - trying to use it
102:57 - as much as he can i can't find nas dude
103:01 - on google you can't find nas domansky
103:04 - no not monkey ah come on man
103:08 - you gotta be able to find there's gotta
103:10 - be so much this guy's all over the
103:12 - internet look at this
103:16 - right here we should use this one oh my
103:18 - god what oh i spelt his name wrong oh
103:20 - damn it i'm sorry no
103:22 - copy image address all right we're gonna
103:26 - drop that in here so i'll create add
103:28 - document
103:29 - auto id uh name
103:35 - knob hey
103:51 - that dope so now we've got three people
103:54 - inside of
103:54 - our database which is enough for now
103:56 - right so um
103:58 - what we can do is let's go over to our
104:00 - tindercards.js right
104:02 - so now what we need to do is rather than
104:05 - um
104:05 - hard coding these values right so we
104:07 - don't want steve and mark zuckerberg to
104:09 - come in here we basically want to pull
104:10 - from the database
104:12 - so we're going to use something called a
104:14 - use effect hook right here so here what
104:16 - we do is we say
104:17 - use effect now what is use effect so
104:20 - very nice way of putting it
104:22 - use effect is simply a piece
104:25 - of code which runs based on a
104:29 - condition it's like yeah it's like a
104:31 - it's kind of like a
104:33 - jacked if statement um for react
104:38 - dynamically if anyone used exactly and
104:41 - if anyone used class-based components
104:43 - use effect replaces all of the lifecycle
104:45 - hooks
104:46 - like lifecycle methods that's how they
104:49 - were able to get over to
104:51 - functional components with a user effect
104:53 - um so here we have the user effect so we
104:55 - need to import that at the top before we
104:56 - carry on so use effect so what are we
104:58 - currently doing right now we're trying
104:59 - to
105:00 - connect to the database right yeah so we
105:03 - want those
105:04 - people that you added inside so yes yeah
105:06 - let's i'm going to show visually what
105:08 - we're talking about here so guys what
105:09 - we're going to do is
105:11 - all of these people so like here we got
105:12 - jeff bezos so we're going to have jeff
105:14 - bezos popping up on
105:16 - our app our our app is this one so we're
105:18 - gonna have jeff bezos popping up here
105:20 - pretty soon
105:21 - then we're gonna have uh elon musk
105:23 - popping up on the app
105:24 - pretty soon so you know be on the
105:26 - lookout for that
105:28 - yeah and we've also got a special guest
105:30 - after that popping up
105:33 - what the hell oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
105:36 - yeah yeah
105:36 - yeah yo we just got another donation
105:42 - did we i don't know if we're gonna cross
105:45 - five dollars but if we cross five
105:47 - dollars i'm gonna lose my [ __ ] because
105:48 - we've never in my life i've never
105:50 - crossed five dollars on
105:51 - live stream chat
105:55 - nice that's insane dude yo guys we're at
105:58 - 19
105:59 - 967 views right now
106:02 - okay sorry let's keep going i'm killing
106:04 - the replay value here
106:07 - so now what we are going to do guys is
106:10 - um
106:10 - we are essentially going to do use
106:13 - effect and then
106:14 - we basically just want to have this so
106:15 - the way we use effect is we have
106:17 - a function so we broke five dollars by
106:21 - the way
106:21 - i'm sorry we five we got five
106:24 - we broke five pounds we broke five
106:27 - dollars we're
106:28 - five dollars and forty cents thank you
106:30 - guys
106:31 - appreciate it and we just broke twenty
106:33 - thousand views
106:34 - twenty thousand views so much guys five
106:37 - dollars
106:39 - this is amazing holy crap
106:42 - that's not the same dude
106:46 - we don't even get that sometimes oh my
106:48 - god that's insane
106:50 - damn it okay so use effect right so
106:53 - inside of the use effect guys we have an
106:54 - arrow function here
106:56 - right so inside here this is where the
106:58 - code runs right this is where the code
107:00 - runs
107:00 - right now underneath there we have this
107:03 - special sort of this is where we put
107:05 - something called dependencies so
107:06 - by leaving it blank this means it's
107:08 - going to run once
107:10 - so by leaving it blank this is going to
107:11 - run once so this will
107:13 - run once once
107:16 - when the component loads
107:20 - and never again right never again
107:23 - so if you have this blank this this the
107:26 - code inside of here will run once when
107:28 - the component loads the tinder cards
107:30 - when it loads
107:30 - but it will never run it again after
107:32 - that right which is really powerful
107:34 - but yeah if i was to put something like
107:36 - people so so just
107:37 - just to be very clear guys what this
107:39 - will do right now is like
107:40 - if the header loads will it run that's
107:43 - my question to you
107:45 - no no it will not run if this thing
107:48 - loads right there or
107:49 - sorry if this card loads right here
107:52 - will it run yes dude
107:56 - somebody just donated five dollars what
108:00 - min chan kim said make it 10 damn dude
108:04 - thank you yo somebody else just donated
108:06 - five or something what is happening
108:11 - oh my god that's insane
108:15 - thank you so much the livestream i think
108:18 - right here thank you guys
108:19 - i'm gonna i'm just i just can't take
108:21 - this anymore
108:23 - it's the early retirement right now dude
108:25 - what is thank you he says make it 10
108:27 - yeah
108:28 - and then rd and danny just put five
108:30 - dollars yo this is so crazy
108:32 - this is so awesome um i mean i'm just
108:34 - having a lot of fun but it's just
108:36 - it's okay yeah dude
108:40 - we love this wow thank you nice
108:44 - so this will run now when we have uh
108:47 - when it when the component loads once as
108:49 - well as whenever people
108:51 - that variable people changes so it's
108:53 - really powerful code snippet right so
108:54 - what is hold on so what does that mean
108:56 - so if i
108:56 - swa what does that mean if people
108:58 - variable people changes if i
109:00 - swipe will that what does that mean that
109:03 - people change
109:04 - or does that mean well only when people
109:05 - get added to the database
109:08 - yeah so this is a very careful thing to
109:10 - be uh
109:11 - you have to be really careful here
109:12 - because if you had for example every
109:14 - time you
109:15 - swiped uh then it would mean that the
109:17 - database were or like what like say for
109:19 - example here i had the dependency
109:21 - where i said yeah so yeah exactly so
109:24 - here we've added people
109:25 - right so every time i swipe people would
109:28 - change
109:29 - if i've manipulated what the p what the
109:31 - list is right rani just put
109:33 - 1 000 that's 10
109:37 - yo they're at the top right now what the
109:40 - hell
109:40 - what is happening oh my god everyone's
109:44 - insane today dude this is great we love
109:47 - you guys
109:48 - oh my god this is so amazing thank you
109:50 - guys i don't
109:51 - i don't know how to like really react to
109:53 - this this is
109:57 - wow oh man thank you guys
110:00 - says we love clever program we love you
110:03 - guys too yes seriously guys
110:05 - thank you this this means a lot really
110:06 - appreciate it
110:08 - yeah a hundred percent right
110:11 - so this would mean yeah whenever people
110:13 - changes
110:14 - it would re-fire this code off right so
110:17 - once when the component knows that when
110:18 - people change it but we don't actually
110:19 - want this at the moment we just want to
110:21 - run it once
110:22 - guiding the component
110:25 - so here what i need to do is
110:28 - quick question for you guys if you're
110:30 - watching this because i really do want
110:31 - you guys to engage and get value out of
110:33 - this
110:34 - how can you make this piece of code fire
110:37 - every time the header changes
110:39 - okay how could you make that fire or
110:41 - maybe some other variable actually
110:43 - header is not a variable in this case
110:45 - right
110:46 - yep so if you guys want another variable
110:50 - how would we do that like let's just say
110:51 - we had a variable called messages so you
110:53 - guys see how we have people let's just
110:54 - say we had
110:55 - one called message okay how would you
110:58 - make this
110:58 - fire every time message changes so think
111:01 - on that i'll give you five seconds
111:02 - five four three two one
111:06 - you would put message right there and it
111:08 - would watch out for that
111:10 - exactly so you would have something like
111:12 - this
111:13 - yep messages yeah like at some points i
111:16 - kind of want to hammer
111:17 - over and over again because like they're
111:19 - like use effect
111:21 - right here and use it use state are like
111:24 - two of the most like
111:25 - common and important things with react
111:27 - if you guys get this you get so much of
111:28 - how react works
111:30 - yeah honestly and that's no joke guys
111:32 - like if you know
111:33 - use state and use effect and you master
111:35 - what props are and how to use props
111:37 - those are literally going to be your
111:39 - fundamentals into building entire apps
111:41 - like and that's not an exaggeration like
111:43 - once you know those things and you know
111:45 - how to use that and for example what
111:46 - we're going to show next is how you use
111:48 - a use effect to put in
111:49 - information from the uh from firebase
111:53 - you can see like there's so much power
111:54 - in just those three things use state use
111:56 - effect and props
111:58 - so um really really amazing uh to
112:02 - so the next step guys the next step is
112:06 - we basically need to
112:07 - import that database that we created
112:09 - earlier right so what i'm going to go
112:11 - ahead and do is say import
112:12 - database from and then we say
112:16 - forward slash firebase so that's the
112:19 - firebase file that we actually created
112:21 - so we're going to import that database
112:23 - so remember the one that we created
112:24 - earlier guys with this one over here
112:26 - we have the default database here
112:29 - the chat revenue is at 25
112:32 - oh my god guys i think what i we will
112:35 - actually make a shirt
112:36 - and then send it out as a giveaway every
112:38 - time i think if it gets up to 30 or 35
112:41 - we're gonna just send it out as a
112:42 - giveaway for you guys
112:44 - i think we should and we should do it
112:45 - like based on like wherever we like
112:47 - today it was tinder
112:48 - yeah yeah yeah it could be like a tinder
112:50 - yeah
112:53 - exclusive one of one tinder yeah
112:56 - nice um so we have we import the
113:00 - database at this point right so now what
113:02 - we're going to do is we're going to say
113:03 - database
113:04 - dot right this is where the magic
113:06 - happens right so we say database dot
113:08 - collection
113:09 - right collection was uh it's referring
113:12 - so so if you open up firebase on the
113:14 - right
113:14 - this would be a really nice visual
113:16 - representation of what we're about to do
113:17 - here
113:19 - um so cause if you go to firebase
113:23 - on the right yep
113:26 - so open up firebase and now we can see
113:28 - that we have
113:29 - the uh so so go to the collection
113:34 - yep okay hold on let me expand it real
113:36 - quick yep right here
113:37 - add comments so you mean add document no
113:40 - no so you can see here guys when we what
113:41 - we're doing is we're going to go to
113:42 - database we're going to go to the people
113:44 - collection
113:45 - and then basically i want to listen to
113:48 - whenever anything changes
113:52 - inside of that collection so i want to
113:53 - basically go ahead and grab
113:55 - all of the documents and attach a
113:57 - listener so that if anything ever
113:58 - changes
113:59 - yep um it's going to pull in give me
114:02 - that new document right so if something
114:04 - gets added to it it's going to give me
114:05 - the new information if something gets
114:06 - deleted it's going to get
114:08 - information right so let me actually
114:10 - highlight that
114:13 - so people you can see it in that little
114:15 - uh i'm going to click
114:16 - here yep so right now he's selecting
114:18 - people by doing this so that's
114:21 - when he says this people collection that
114:23 - he's getting access to that entire
114:25 - um document at that entire collection of
114:28 - people
114:28 - so in this case right now it's elon musk
114:31 - it is
114:32 - jeff bezos and then it's nas
114:35 - exactly exactly that so we're going to
114:38 - go ahead and say
114:40 - collection people and then what we're
114:42 - going to say is on snapshot right so on
114:44 - snapshot is going to be your best friend
114:46 - and it's a really really powerful thing
114:48 - and basically what it's saying is go
114:50 - ahead and listen
114:52 - to or like take imagine like if you
114:54 - literally grab a camera
114:55 - and you take a picture of the database
114:57 - right so you take a picture of the
114:58 - database and it's going to give you back
115:00 - all of the documents inside of a
115:01 - snapshot right yeah
115:03 - so we now have that snapshot with all
115:05 - the documents inside of it
115:07 - what i want to do is i basically want to
115:10 - say
115:10 - snapshot dot docs so i'm basically
115:13 - saying with that snapshot
115:14 - it's like yo get me get me literally all
115:16 - of these in this case it's literally
115:18 - these three okay so right now
115:20 - this will get you all three of those and
115:22 - then you can loop through it
115:24 - after exactly so we're gonna say
115:27 - snapshot.docs.map
115:29 - so they say go through every single one
115:30 - go through every single doc
115:32 - and basically get me the document
115:35 - data and return it to me right now the
115:38 - document data
115:40 - is documented document data is this guy
115:43 - so
115:43 - if i click inside of here document data
115:46 - will be
115:46 - this it will be this object that we get
115:49 - back here name is jeff bezos and then
115:51 - the url
115:52 - okay so that's what it will simplify to
115:56 - exactly so it'll be those two things and
115:59 - then what we're going to do is we're
116:00 - actually going to go ahead
116:01 - and wrap this entire thing inside of set
116:03 - people
116:04 - and what this magic line of code does is
116:07 - it's basically saying
116:09 - right so anytime the database changes
116:12 - take a picture of it right so on
116:14 - snapchat it's always going to be
116:15 - listening right
116:16 - so take a picture of it send me the new
116:19 - document so so here is where the magic
116:21 - happens right here and these in this
116:22 - line
116:22 - so we say snapshot.docs.map it's going
116:25 - to go through all of the documents that
116:26 - came back with that new
116:27 - sort of snapshot and it's going to set
116:30 - all of that
116:31 - in inside of the people array so instead
116:33 - of pulling it now
116:35 - from here basically we can actually
116:37 - confidently go ahead and get rid of this
116:39 - and leave this with a blank array and
116:42 - now
116:43 - how many of you guys do you think is if
116:44 - this works first time i'll be super
116:46 - pumped i'll be happy but
116:47 - now if we go ahead and open up our
116:49 - localhost
116:51 - uh 3000 as in so localhost
116:55 - yep now if as soon as i hit save it
116:58 - should reframe
116:59 - that would actually be crazy if that
117:00 - works so guys now we're about to
117:02 - actually just connect straight up to the
117:03 - database
117:04 - like it's going to be pretty freaking
117:05 - gangster like we're literally just
117:07 - pulling all these people
117:08 - real time and gonna be populating our
117:11 - app with it
117:12 - so we don't know if it's gonna work
117:13 - right this second but let's actually try
117:15 - it if it works that's
117:16 - that's pretty freaking gangster yeah i
117:18 - think if it works i think it deserves
117:20 - the thumbs up
117:21 - nice so let's go ahead and get the app
117:24 - on the right
117:25 - mm-hmm um yeah so as soon as i hit save
117:28 - so i'm going
117:28 - back to i should see jeff bezos or elon
117:30 - musk or something like that
117:32 - yep so it's refreshing oh somebody even
117:35 - better
117:36 - no
117:38 - [Music]
117:41 - should we send this to his mom like what
117:43 - is he doing on tinder
117:47 - nice dude then swipe through it and you
117:49 - can see like now they've all come
117:51 - through so and even the name tags you
117:53 - see that
117:53 - hold on hold on dude that is so cool so
117:56 - i'm just gonna put the database on the
117:57 - left hand side guys take a look at this
117:59 - right right so beautiful
118:00 - so here we got nas domonsky look at that
118:05 - he went from an array to a real human
118:08 - being
118:09 - that is cool i love that about coding
118:12 - he went from a url to an actual person
118:17 - now i'm going to swipe and
118:21 - we are going to get elon musk next
118:24 - whoo nice
118:27 - right here and take a look at that elon
118:29 - musk
118:31 - yep and then next up is going to be jeff
118:33 - bezos so let's swipe right on elon musk
118:36 - because we like him
118:38 - and now we got this guy yo
118:43 - he's gonna be like ranked number one on
118:45 - tinder
118:47 - exactly who else thinks he kind of
118:51 - looked when he was younger like who else
118:52 - thinks he kind of looked like kevin
118:54 - spacey
118:55 - like i i feel like he looked like do you
118:58 - feel that
118:58 - when he was younger kevin spacey who's
119:01 - kevin's face
119:02 - he rings the bell he's kind of spacey uh
119:05 - he used to be in house of cards and then
119:07 - he had that controversial stuff happen
119:10 - yeah yeah i can see it i can see it
119:12 - right
119:13 - yeah yeah imagine kevin spacey shaved
119:16 - his head off
119:17 - yeah yeah like but now he's more badass
119:19 - you know because he
119:20 - once you get i think billions and
119:22 - billions of dollars you kind of get
119:23 - jacked and
119:24 - bald and you become very badass yeah
119:27 - there's a good meme with it yeah
119:31 - um dope okay so that that works really
119:33 - nice guys
119:34 - and just to show you a little cool trick
119:36 - now if we actually keep that open and
119:37 - open up firebase on the left again
119:41 - so let's open up firebase on the left
119:44 - okay you want me to
119:45 - open it up and put it right here yeah
119:48 - yeah now if we go to jeff bezos
119:50 - and let's just go ahead and have the app
119:52 - open so you see his name field right
119:54 - let's try something let's type in so
119:55 - it's right
119:58 - yeah let's type in jeff bezos in there
120:00 - right
120:01 - here yeah let's just type in amazon god
120:03 - or something
120:07 - guys watch this as soon as he clicks
120:08 - update it will take a snapshot and it
120:10 - you know
120:15 - without refreshing without anything and
120:18 - it's hosted on
120:19 - slash kazi let's go yeah
120:23 - oh my god all right that is nice
120:26 - wow
120:29 - look at that
120:33 - hey dude wow
120:38 - that is so cool love it okay yeah
120:42 - hero blessing just said this thing is
120:43 - becoming interesting right
120:45 - yeah hooray i love that
120:49 - all right so there we go we have it
120:52 - working now um what we are going to move
120:55 - on to
120:56 - next is the so let's go have a look at
120:59 - look our app.js
121:02 - so i think the next step would be to
121:05 - actually go ahead and
121:06 - build the buttons underneath the tinder
121:08 - cards all right
121:10 - so the buttons before before you go on
121:12 - let's actually show what you're talking
121:13 - about
121:14 - yeah okay so when we say buttons these
121:17 - are the buttons we're gonna be building
121:19 - guys
121:19 - underneath the tinder cards yeah because
121:22 - we don't have them right now if we go to
121:24 - our app you can see we don't have them
121:26 - right now
121:27 - exactly cool so just to clean things up
121:29 - i'm going to get rid of the h1 which
121:31 - says tinder cards
121:32 - and you'll see you'll immediately start
121:34 - looking a bit more like a tinder app so
121:36 - there you go it's clean and you see that
121:39 - back shadow
121:40 - that back uh box shadow that we added
121:42 - really really nice
121:44 - yeah okay so so his now amman says
121:47 - say now that we've made the use effect
121:49 - please explain what what when a clean up
121:51 - process is necessary
121:52 - so really good question i actually do
121:53 - want to cover this one quickly um so you
121:55 - see here guys
121:57 - um in a use effect right so let's say
122:00 - for example here
122:01 - right what we what this is actually a
122:03 - really good use case of where we can
122:04 - actually use the cleanup method so
122:06 - use effect so so this this is a listener
122:09 - right which means that
122:11 - every time the database changes it's
122:13 - going to tell us about that change
122:15 - but let's say i had like people in here
122:17 - for example
122:18 - it's going to keep on attaching it
122:20 - attaching a listener every single time
122:22 - this changes which means that in the end
122:24 - of it you might have a hundred listeners
122:25 - which
122:26 - trust me will start to slow down your
122:28 - browser right so
122:30 - what they do is on snapshot actually
122:32 - returns us something called
122:33 - unsubscribe it returns us something
122:36 - called unsubscribe
122:37 - so you can actually do this you can say
122:38 - cons unsubscribe right
122:40 - now what you can do with a user effect
122:43 - is let's say before let's say so every
122:45 - single time so let's say people changes
122:48 - before it's going to re-execute this
122:50 - code you can make it fire off something
122:52 - called a clean
122:52 - up function and the way you do that is
122:54 - you return an arrow function
122:56 - right and anything in here so this is
123:00 - the cleanup right so this is what it's
123:02 - called a cleanup right
123:03 - so this is really important and
123:06 - basically what we can do in here is we
123:07 - can say unsubscribe so this basically
123:09 - will on
123:10 - it will detach the old listener before
123:13 - so imagine what happens right so let's
123:15 - go through the first time the component
123:16 - mounts it subscribes it starts listening
123:18 - to the database
123:19 - perfect let's say kazi swipes and he
123:22 - goes through and
123:22 - he swipes through the person right now
123:24 - the people changed right so the people
123:26 - variable update which means that right
123:29 - you would think it would just go ahead
123:30 - and
123:30 - attach another listener but no first we
123:32 - need to unsubscribe
123:34 - and then it will reattach another
123:36 - listener
123:37 - so that's a perfect example of when we
123:40 - would want to use it so in this case
123:41 - it's very good practice just to have it
123:43 - like this so very good question
123:45 - and um yeah so if you guys don't want
123:47 - your app to just
123:48 - break because it'll have like hundreds
123:50 - of listeners or thousands of listeners
123:52 - over time
123:53 - just make sure you unsubscribe your
123:56 - listeners after they're done listening
123:58 - yeah exactly the only thing that's
124:01 - confusing about it is that like
124:03 - it's kind of like you're calling the
124:05 - function unsubscribe but like really
124:07 - what it's doing is actually displaying a
124:10 - snapshot
124:11 - of every single person that's why that's
124:14 - where like whenever i read that
124:15 - unsubscribe it would throw me off
124:16 - because i'm like wait that's not
124:17 - unsubscribing that's actually showing
124:20 - and pulling the data from the database
124:22 - you know what i mean so
124:23 - this is going ahead and pulling the data
124:25 - from the database right but
124:27 - what actually happens is that this is a
124:29 - like it's a chain of
124:30 - it's like a promise right yeah but so
124:32 - it's a promise which basically gives you
124:34 - back this but it also
124:36 - like after all of that it gives you back
124:38 - as a function which you can store in a
124:40 - variable
124:41 - so what we are doing is we actually
124:43 - calling that function and that would
124:44 - detach the listener in the browser got
124:47 - it right okay
124:48 - yeah so that's that bit there so now
124:51 - what we're going to do is
124:52 - let's go ahead and create the uh swipe
124:55 - buttons i like to call them right so
124:58 - in apps.js what we can do is just go
125:00 - ahead and what we're going to do is
125:01 - we're going to say underneath the tinder
125:02 - cards
125:03 - let's go ahead and create something
125:04 - called the swipe buttons right so swipe
125:06 - buttons
125:07 - right now swipe buttons suggest so what
125:10 - we can do now is we can go ahead and
125:12 - create that file so i'm going to go
125:13 - ahead and create a file called swipe
125:15 - oops i'm going to create a file called
125:18 - swipe
125:19 - buttons.js yep
125:23 - now we're in here and i say rfce oops
125:26 - wait
125:26 - rfce there we go swipe buttons
125:30 - now here i'm going to say h12 i'm saying
125:33 - buttons go
125:34 - here oh nice yo justin what's up man
125:38 - he is actually a high school friend back
125:40 - when i was actually playing chess
125:43 - and he we i used to go to the chess club
125:44 - and he was there and he goes damn i
125:46 - walked into the wrong level of class
125:47 - where's 101 at loving this though
125:50 - but seriously yeah i love that actually
125:53 - but seriously real talk
125:54 - justin and everybody who's here even if
125:56 - it doesn't feel like 101
125:58 - that's okay um it's kind of a weird way
126:01 - to learn like this but i actually
126:03 - recommend you just
126:04 - build these things with us by literally
126:05 - copying code and like kind of following
126:08 - along because
126:09 - you will learn a lot more through just a
126:11 - sheer pattern recognition
126:13 - then even just to so much theoretical
126:16 - way of like slowly building up to this
126:18 - so
126:20 - i we know you won't understand a lot of
126:22 - it but i think it'll just like start
126:23 - giving you a lot of that pattern
126:24 - recognition which over time will start
126:25 - to make sense
126:27 - exactly really good point there yeah
126:29 - like guys even if you're not following
126:30 - word for word
126:31 - you'll start to notice the patterns
126:32 - you'll start to realize the sort of okay
126:34 - that's how react works and this
126:36 - that's what react router is and then
126:38 - over time it just gets stronger that
126:39 - knowledge
126:40 - and it's a lot of fun it's a lot of fun
126:42 - because you're building real things at
126:43 - the end of the day
126:45 - exactly and these all can sit on your
126:46 - portfolio guys and it really will help
126:48 - you get a job and it will help you sort
126:49 - of push further in your career so
126:51 - no loss by doing that yeah nice
126:55 - so now um oh nice some
126:58 - somebody said sonny try r-a-f-c-e
127:01 - next time for the react snippet so if i
127:03 - do this and i do r-a-f-c-e
127:07 - oh dope nice it gives you the cons that
127:11 - you've been looking
127:12 - for the arrow functions exactly
127:15 - please if you're coding with me don't do
127:16 - that because i like seeing function
127:19 - this throws
127:22 - all right so you've got the swipe
127:23 - buttons here right so now what we can do
127:26 - is we go here but we need to import so
127:27 - let's go ahead and import it
127:29 - so boom boom there we go important
127:33 - and what we can do now
127:36 - is we can say so you see it goes behind
127:40 - right so let's go ahead and make the
127:42 - code
127:43 - uh oh yeah so you can see it's actually
127:44 - behind us right now it says it says a b
127:47 - can you see it says like there's a b
127:48 - next in ours
127:50 - yeah yeah yeah i see that right there
127:53 - right
127:53 - so instead now because we've got this
127:55 - sort of weird dynamic sort of way of
127:57 - laying things out
127:58 - we're going to go ahead and follow that
127:59 - same dynamic layout when it comes to um
128:02 - the but the swipe button so firstly just
128:05 - to prepare ourselves let's go ahead and
128:06 - create a
128:07 - swipe buttons.css so here i'm going to
128:09 - go ahead and create a file and do swipe
128:11 - buttons swipe buttons
128:12 - dot css somebody just said tick tock
128:16 - clone for devs
128:17 - dev talk oh my god
128:20 - you dude this million dollar ideas today
128:24 - dev talk tinder instead of dev talk
128:28 - tick tock just got banned in india so i
128:30 - think we can pretty much swoop in at
128:31 - this point
128:34 - that's hilarious yeah that would be
128:35 - amazing to bring all the developers on
128:37 - tick tock
128:39 - yeah that'd be insane nice so we have
128:42 - swipe buttons.css right
128:44 - so we just pulled that in so now what
128:45 - we're going to do is
128:47 - we basically we need to
128:50 - set a class name here so class name of
128:54 - swipe button swipe buttons okay and then
128:57 - what we're going to do is
128:58 - so all of the icons that we see
129:02 - in our demo the ones that we showed you
129:04 - right all of them that we saw
129:07 - we essentially have oh
129:10 - i'm actually just trying out a few of
129:12 - the stuff that
129:13 - uh some shortcuts that naveen is
129:16 - actually suggesting and i'm like oh
129:18 - so he said to try sfc
129:21 - i think is he saying rsfc i can't find
129:24 - it
129:25 - and lmr but okay keep going my bad i'll
129:29 - do these
129:29 - fun shortcuts later nice
129:32 - so now guys we've got a bunch of
129:34 - different um
129:35 - icons right so i'm gonna go ahead and
129:37 - show you i'm gonna save you a bunch of
129:38 - time
129:39 - so i'm gonna actually go ahead and
129:40 - import them all in one go so the top
129:42 - these icons right here right these are
129:45 - all those icons that you saw in our demo
129:48 - right so at the bottom these are all the
129:49 - icons that you saw in our demo
129:51 - now these are hold on just to be clear
129:54 - these icons guys right there are all the
129:57 - ones at the bottom right
129:59 - here that's what he's referring to
130:01 - exactly yeah cool those are those ones
130:03 - right
130:04 - now what we're going to do is what i'm
130:06 - simply going to do is i'm just going to
130:07 - start popping them in right so here what
130:09 - i'm going to do is i'm going to say boom
130:10 - we get that one we're going to have the
130:12 - clo so we have the replay icon we have
130:14 - the close icon
130:16 - we have the star rating so that sort of
130:18 - that sort of star
130:19 - icon we're gonna have a the heart icon
130:22 - is
130:22 - is called favorite icon and then the
130:24 - sort of lightning icon is something
130:26 - called flash on icon right so if i save
130:28 - that now
130:30 - what we should see is it will go behind
130:31 - nars but we'll see
130:33 - that the icons actually pop up they're
130:36 - there
130:38 - right if you swipe away a few times you
130:40 - should be able to see behind it we get
130:41 - those icons right
130:43 - yeah so what we can do now is
130:46 - firstly we can increase the size of oh
130:48 - no we've actually done that already so
130:49 - we've
130:50 - we've gone ahead and gave it a font size
130:51 - of large right so what we can do now is
130:53 - we can actually go ahead and
130:54 - fix that styling of that the sort of
130:56 - where they should be so we're going to
130:58 - swipe buttons
130:58 - and here we say target that container
131:01 - which is carrying everything
131:03 - and basically go ahead and say it's a
131:04 - position fixed so i'm going to give it a
131:06 - fixed position
131:07 - by the way one thing i wanted to say
131:08 - guys is sunny when are we building
131:10 - we're building the youtube clone on
131:11 - wednesday right
131:13 - uh i think so yeah is it yeah wednesday
131:15 - con yeah so guys we're building the
131:17 - youtube clone
131:18 - this wednesday so make sure you mark
131:20 - that on your calendar it's going to be
131:22 - around 10 a.m pacific and then this
131:24 - thursday we're actually building the
131:26 - tick tock clone
131:27 - yeah so mark that on your calendar as
131:31 - well those are two things that i want to
131:33 - let you guys know
131:34 - exactly and guys there's two big builds
131:36 - right there so i hope you guys are
131:38 - excited for that
131:39 - uh we're definitely being challenged
131:41 - with those two builds so it'll be some
131:43 - fun
131:43 - right there um so nice we've got a
131:45 - position fixed
131:46 - then what we're gonna do is we're gonna
131:47 - say bottom and i'm gonna use something
131:49 - called ten view height so i want ten 10
131:51 - of the screen i want to push it up by 10
131:53 - of the screen right
131:54 - and then what we're going to say is
131:57 - right now
131:58 - they are sort of tightly chucked
132:01 - together right so i'm going to say
132:02 - display flex
132:04 - which means that they're basically going
132:05 - to still be tightly chunked together
132:07 - but i'm going to say justify content
132:10 - and i'm going to say space evenly right
132:12 - so space evenly so i'll do this actually
132:14 - i'll get rid of this first
132:15 - i'll do width of 100 so i'll show you
132:17 - guys exactly how this looks
132:19 - firstly so if i save this now
132:23 - we should now see that the um
132:26 - that if we open up the yes you should
132:28 - now see it's on the bottom right
132:30 - bottom left sorry yeah it's on the
132:32 - bottom left and that's because it's
132:34 - right now it's
132:34 - um so we've gave it a width of 100 but
132:37 - we've said that everything's next to
132:38 - each other so
132:39 - what we need to do now is we say display
132:41 - flex
132:42 - and then i want to say justify content
132:44 - and i want them to space themselves out
132:46 - without telling it anymore so i'm gonna
132:47 - say space
132:48 - evenly and if i do that
132:53 - look at that so sunny on the cheat sheet
132:57 - for this one i think we should do like
133:00 - space evenly and have this at the bottom
133:03 - yeah exactly you can have space between
133:07 - you can show like the different variants
133:08 - of it which would be awesome yeah
133:10 - that is clean okay beautiful now
133:13 - we have that right but what we want to
133:16 - essentially do
133:17 - is also have it so that these are all
133:19 - buttons right so right now they're not
133:20 - clickable
133:21 - yeah they're not clickable buttons so
133:24 - what we need to do now is we actually
133:26 - need to wrap them in something called
133:28 - icon buttons remember what we did
133:30 - earlier so i'm going to go ahead and
133:31 - import that
133:32 - so icon button and what i'm going to
133:34 - basically go ahead and do
133:36 - is go and actually do this so i'm going
133:39 - to say
133:40 - i'm going to basically say icon button
133:42 - and then i'm gonna go ahead
133:44 - and wrap that oops the icon button and
133:46 - i'm gonna wrap that
133:47 - now if i save this first one right so
133:50 - i'm gonna save that first one
133:51 - notice how the first one is slightly
133:53 - different to the rest of them and it's
133:55 - actually clickable now
133:57 - um so if you actually go ahead and click
134:00 - on the first
134:01 - uh bottom left ah nice so that one's
134:04 - actually clickable now which is nice
134:05 - right
134:06 - now so i'm going to go ahead and do the
134:09 - same thing for every single
134:10 - all of them and wrap them in this icon
134:12 - button got it
134:13 - exactly yep so i'm going to go ahead and
134:15 - do this i'm going to say
134:17 - button and then i'm basically going to
134:18 - do this boom
134:21 - and what i'm going to do is to save time
134:23 - here what i'm actually going to do is
134:24 - i'm going to copy a snippet where we've
134:25 - done this
134:26 - previously and i'm going to actually go
134:28 - ahead
134:29 - and also give them all class names which
134:32 - are applicable to each of them right so
134:33 - i'll go ahead and explain that now so
134:36 - i'm gonna paste so now we have the icons
134:39 - but each one has got an appropriate
134:40 - class name so we've got the swipe
134:42 - buttons repeat
134:43 - swipe buttons left for the cross right
134:46 - swipe button star for the middle ones
134:48 - white ones right for the love heart
134:50 - and swipe buttons with lightning for the
134:51 - right right so now they're all clickable
134:53 - buttons
134:54 - but obviously we want to style them more
134:56 - differently right
134:57 - so we want every single one to just have
134:59 - a bit more of a different style
135:01 - so and now what we can do is we go into
135:02 - swipe buttons.css
135:04 - and pretty much we can go ahead and give
135:07 - them the following
135:08 - so we can actually go ahead and say that
135:10 - so
135:11 - i want to target all of the swipe
135:13 - buttons but all of the material
135:15 - buttons right so if you actually inspect
135:17 - them and you can actually find
135:18 - the exact css cast to target but i want
135:21 - all of those
135:22 - to actually go ahead and have a box
135:24 - shadow because right now
135:25 - they kind of they're just kind of like
135:27 - hard to tell that that's a button
135:30 - so right now what we're going to do is
135:31 - we're going to say go to the swipe ones
135:33 - and this is the special class the
135:34 - material ui adds on
135:36 - for all of the buttons right so it adds
135:38 - on adds these for all the buttons what
135:40 - i'm going to do is i'm going to give it
135:41 - a
135:42 - background color of white and we need to
135:44 - give it a box shadow but after the box
135:45 - shadow i need to say it's important
135:47 - because
135:47 - we need to override material ui's box
135:50 - shadow so as soon as i click save
135:51 - notice the buttons on the bottom right
135:55 - so boom they get that nice floating
135:57 - effect right
135:59 - which immediately colors yeah if i look
136:02 - between these two they're looking great
136:05 - and that's just one of the big
136:06 - differences i see between the two
136:08 - exactly and now you can see like as soon
136:10 - as we do that
136:11 - like you actually get this really nice
136:13 - like it's a very
136:14 - sudden visual sort of cue it's like
136:16 - these are clickable right
136:18 - these are actually clickable things
136:19 - right so the first one we're going to do
136:21 - is we're actually going to go ahead and
136:22 - start the first button so the swipe
136:23 - buttons repeat
136:24 - right is the left button and for every
136:27 - single button i'm going to go ahead and
136:28 - give it up this is actually pretty
136:29 - awesome
136:30 - i've been outside i've done amazon
136:32 - netflix
136:34 - instagram covid19 tracker
136:37 - uh and youtube thumbnail clones hey
136:40 - that's amazing dude that is a solid
136:43 - portfolio in one week
136:45 - yeah and if you do guys if you guys have
136:47 - done that so
136:49 - if anyone else has done that make sure
136:50 - you do shoot shoot a story on instagram
136:53 - tag us in there and we'd love to see it
136:54 - because that's the easiest way for me
136:55 - and qazi to go and then
136:57 - actually go ahead and check it out so
136:59 - our tags are right here you just need to
137:01 - go
137:01 - shoot a video and then tag us and we can
137:04 - then have a chat with you guys which is
137:05 - always awesome to do that
137:07 - um so yeah we're going to add a little
137:09 - bit of padding around this
137:10 - the first button and we're going to use
137:12 - three view width which is basically
137:13 - going to say
137:14 - depending on how big the screen is i
137:16 - only use three percent of that screen
137:18 - the width to determine the the padding
137:20 - around it which is really nice it gives
137:21 - you a really nice
137:22 - uh responsive design now as soon as i
137:24 - hit save
137:26 - you notice how the first button got a
137:27 - bit bigger but the rest kind of squeezed
137:29 - up
137:29 - right so what i'm going to go ahead and
137:32 - do is firstly i'm going to change the
137:33 - color of that button so i want it to be
137:34 - an orange one because that's the one
137:36 - that they have in tinder
137:37 - and i match the colors perfectly so now
137:39 - you can see it's got a nice orange color
137:41 - to it right so it's got a nice orange
137:42 - and even when you click it
137:44 - it's got a nice little orange hue so it
137:46 - gets this nice sort of orange like
137:47 - ripple effect as opposed to what the
137:49 - sort of boring one that we had before
137:51 - now i'm going to do the same for every
137:53 - single one
137:54 - but i'm going to copy this in here same
137:56 - for every single one i'm going to change
137:57 - the colors
137:58 - so you can see i've copied in a snippet
138:00 - here so the same for all of them as soon
138:01 - as i hit save now
138:03 - watch how the app suddenly gets so
138:04 - colorful so as soon as i hit that boom
138:06 - save and
138:11 - set of icons right now it's looking very
138:13 - similar to this app and this app
138:16 - the only thing i stink is like the drop
138:18 - shadows a little harder on this one
138:21 - yeah to be honest the height in the
138:23 - second build is actually better
138:25 - so the height is more centered yeah so
138:27 - we actually went ahead and fixed that i
138:28 - made it less drastic because
138:30 - the first time we did it we made it a
138:31 - bit aggressive
138:34 - all right yeah so awesome so
138:37 - now we actually have the buttons
138:39 - complete right so the buttons are quite
138:40 - visual
138:41 - a visual cue uh we can we can if you
138:43 - guys enjoy that we can actually go ahead
138:45 - and upgrade that
138:45 - in the future to show you how we can
138:47 - code the button functionality but for
138:49 - this case
138:50 - we've just done the swiping
138:51 - functionality and now we're going to
138:53 - focus on what happens when you click
138:55 - the messages icon so that one right
138:58 - there that's the functionality we're
139:00 - going to be building right now guys
139:01 - right there
139:02 - boom yeah so what happens when you click
139:05 - the messaging icon right so
139:08 - what's our goal here we want it to
139:10 - essentially have it so that when we
139:11 - click that
139:12 - it's going to direct us to another
139:15 - screen
139:16 - and on that screen we're going to have
139:18 - it so that you can have that uh the list
139:20 - of messages right
139:21 - so the first way we do it is we go to
139:23 - app.js
139:25 - and here we basically have we firstly
139:28 - define the root
139:29 - okay so the first route that we're going
139:30 - to have is called chats
139:32 - okay so let's go ahead and say chats um
139:35 - so whenever we go to four slash chats we
139:38 - want to have the header
139:39 - and we also want to have the ch sort of
139:41 - rather than saying i'm a chat page
139:44 - um we want to say well so firstly let's
139:46 - actually keep it as i'm a chat page i'm
139:47 - going to show you now
139:48 - how to link that button to that page
139:52 - right so i'll show you how to link that
139:53 - button to that page so
139:55 - um if we go over to our header right now
139:58 - so we go to header.js
140:01 - now we have the uh icon
140:04 - over here so the icon is right here
140:07 - so jose asks can sunny can you change
140:09 - the color passing the prop color to the
140:12 - component
140:14 - you can i believe uh the best way to do
140:17 - it is by using something called a
140:18 - material ui
140:19 - theme that's the cleanest way to do it
140:22 - um but i think you can do that yes
140:24 - you can also pass it as a prop yeah got
140:26 - it yeah
140:27 - um so there's a few ways you can start
140:29 - with material ui
140:31 - um so the way that we're gonna do we're
140:32 - gonna connect this now is basically
140:34 - we're gonna wrap
140:36 - this in something called a link so it's
140:38 - a capital l link
140:40 - right and this link is essentially just
140:42 - gonna wrap so it's going to wrap
140:44 - the icon button so this is the button
140:46 - for the messaging
140:48 - so wrap it and this has a prop called
140:50 - two
140:51 - and all you've got to do here is
140:52 - basically just put in the url that you
140:54 - want it to go to
140:55 - right so as soon as i do that it's going
140:57 - to freak out it's going to say whoa whoa
140:58 - you didn't define what a link is
141:00 - so in this case all we need to do is go
141:03 - ahead and import it
141:04 - here so get rid of that so we say import
141:06 - link from react viewer dom
141:08 - right and save it and now
141:12 - we should be able to see that if once
141:14 - this uh
141:15 - loads up so you should not use link in
141:17 - outside of a router
141:18 - uh okay so this is a good point right so
141:21 - if you guys run into this issue
141:23 - it says you should not be using link
141:25 - outside of router so we go to app.js
141:27 - notice how the um the header is outside
141:31 - the router this has to actually be
141:33 - inside the router but it has to be a
141:35 - child because then it gets access to all
141:36 - the routing
141:38 - right so if i click save now now
141:41 - it shouldn't it should stop freaking out
141:43 - now um it should actually
141:45 - work quite nicely so if i go ahead and
141:47 - refresh
141:48 - there we go so now if we go ahead and
141:50 - click that messaging um that top right
141:52 - icon
141:54 - top right icon got it yeah the only
141:57 - reason it's not working is because you
141:59 - called it chats plural oh yeah
142:01 - there we go save it to regular chat and
142:03 - i click it now boom it goes i am the
142:05 - chat page
142:07 - perfect perfect right so that's a good
142:09 - catch um
142:10 - nice i don't know how i cut that but
142:12 - yeah nice
142:14 - so then what we want to do is we also
142:15 - want to have it so when you click the
142:16 - tinder icon
142:17 - it's going to take you back to the
142:19 - homepage right so let's just have that
142:20 - as well which would be kind of a neat
142:22 - functionality so
142:23 - what we're going to do then and this
142:24 - will show us that this will give you a
142:26 - demonstration as to how we can do
142:27 - routing so we can do link to
142:29 - and then we can say forward slash and
142:31 - then we close it i don't know why that
142:33 - does that
142:34 - um yep let me do this i'm gonna go ahead
142:37 - and drop the image
142:38 - tag inside there so boom there we go
142:42 - and now if we save this so if you go
142:46 - ahead and click on the messaging
142:47 - icon it will direct us to the messaging
142:51 - specs section and then you click on the
142:52 - tinder icon
142:54 - and brings us back to the home page nice
142:56 - nice right so now we have brewing we
142:58 - have pagerank
142:59 - right which is awesome all right so i
143:02 - guess what we could do here
143:03 - is we're actually going to go a step
143:05 - further we're going to have the uh
143:07 - you see where it says the profile of a
143:09 - person right
143:10 - we're actually going to go ahead and
143:11 - have that change to a back button arrow
143:14 - right so it's going to basically be like
143:15 - a back button
143:16 - right now the way we do this is we
143:19 - basically go ahead and
143:21 - we use a prop so i'm going to go ahead
143:23 - and go to app.js
143:26 - app.js and basically i'm going to move
143:28 - the header now so that it doesn't appear
143:29 - at the default here at the top
143:31 - i'm basically going to push it in at
143:32 - these two points so
143:34 - um just for now as a demonstration i'm
143:37 - going to pass it in
143:38 - at this point here so here and i'm going
143:41 - to pass it in here
143:43 - so it's just rendering at these two
143:44 - points right now there's a reason why
143:47 - you can also make it so that is it's
143:49 - clean and you can do it the other way
143:50 - but for now we're going to do it like
143:51 - this
143:51 - and basically i'm going to say a back
143:53 - button prop is going to basically
143:56 - so the back button here is going to take
143:59 - you
143:59 - back to forward slash right
144:03 - so whenever we use the back button here
144:05 - it's going to take you back to forward
144:06 - slash
144:07 - where's the back button what back button
144:10 - so this is where we're going to
144:11 - implement it so if you go to the
144:12 - messages
144:14 - so go to your messages and then here ah
144:16 - the back button i see
144:18 - i see when i click messages it comes up
144:19 - right there yeah
144:21 - okay we want that right whoa somebody
144:24 - just donated 10 euros dude
144:26 - whoa max hey
144:30 - nice thank you dude wow
144:34 - guys 10 euros what is happening on this
144:36 - stream
144:37 - guys this is the most donation already
144:40 - that we've ever gone in our entire
144:42 - life 25 we were up at 25
144:45 - and now with 10 euros coming in hot from
144:48 - max zeus i think that puts us at like
144:50 - 37 bucks or something yeah i mean
144:55 - that's insane damn
144:59 - yo that is awesome guys by the way guys
145:02 - if you
145:02 - are watching this and you're enjoying
145:04 - this drop it in the comments below let's
145:05 - keep that energy pumping because i see
145:07 - that
145:08 - that that little trend dropping down so
145:10 - i feel like you know the energy just
145:12 - needs to be lifted up a little bit also
145:14 - like a video and we're almost at 25
145:17 - 000 views this has never happened before
145:20 - so my dude super super exciting
145:26 - oh warden says hello sonny and kazi i'm
145:28 - from the philippines
145:29 - oh no it did i oh yeah so the nightbot
145:32 - sometimes
145:33 - we have an automated bot guys sometimes
145:34 - it will delete your messages if you use
145:36 - too many capital letters
145:38 - so um try to stay under that yes
145:41 - yes please okay so
145:44 - now we have the header right so what
145:47 - we're going to do now is we go back
145:48 - inside of header.js all you need to do
145:51 - is go to
145:52 - the um we're actually going to pass in a
145:54 - prop so we passed in that
145:56 - previously so here's where props goes
145:58 - but we can use es6 to destructure
146:00 - props at this point and say go and get
146:02 - the back button right so go and get the
146:04 - back button
146:05 - um and what we can say here is we can do
146:08 - something very clever here now we can
146:10 - say
146:11 - we can say if so firstly we need the
146:13 - arrow the back arrow icon right
146:15 - so the back arrow icon i'm going to go
146:16 - ahead and import is this one right here
146:19 - so this is the arrow back icon and what
146:22 - we're going to say now is i'm going to
146:23 - say
146:24 - some jsx i'm going to say if there was a
146:26 - back button that we passed in as a prop
146:28 - then render this surrender
146:32 - the um the uh
146:36 - render this right so render the arrow
146:38 - back
146:39 - icon okay got it got it so you basically
146:41 - are saying
146:43 - so hold on hold on what are we overall
146:45 - trying to do like if we're on the
146:47 - messages then
146:48 - render back button otherwise just keep
146:50 - it
146:51 - the person icon so it's not if we're on
146:53 - the messages it's saying if you passed
146:55 - in a back button
146:56 - prop so in this case you see here we
146:58 - passed in a backbone
146:59 - prop oh when we're inside this route i
147:02 - see yeah yeah yeah we passed this one it
147:03 - doesn't have it right
147:05 - nice it knows so you could do this and
147:08 - then basically we're going to say at
147:09 - this point
147:10 - um we just want to have this one here so
147:13 - that's kind of cool that we're using
147:15 - like uh
147:16 - if condition to render this that's
147:18 - that's cool
147:19 - yeah exactly it's very clean way of
147:21 - doing it and i will just
147:23 - clean this up for you guys in one sec so
147:25 - priya will do its job
147:26 - now here we go so now i'm saying if
147:29 - there's a back button
147:30 - then do this so if the background prop
147:32 - has been passed in do this
147:34 - otherwise do this right now what we need
147:37 - to do is on the
147:40 - if we pass in the back button we want it
147:42 - to actually go
147:43 - back to the page that we said right we
147:45 - want to go back to that page
147:46 - so how do we actually implement that so
147:49 - uh
147:49 - reactor or dom so reactor actually gives
147:52 - us a very nice thing over here called
147:54 - use history
147:55 - so use history hook and what this does
147:58 - is it gives us the browser history so
147:59 - what we did we said if you say cons
148:01 - history equals
148:02 - use history for uh open parentheses
148:06 - close right so it gives us this
148:08 - it gives us the browser history right
148:10 - and what we can do is we can say
148:12 - when i mean the browser history guys i
148:14 - don't mean your entire browser history i
148:15 - mean like you're literally your session
148:17 - so like how if you went forward and back
148:19 - a couple of times that history
148:21 - right um so now what we can say is we
148:24 - say on click
148:26 - and then here i'm going to do an
148:28 - anonymous like an arrow function
148:29 - and then i'm going to say history dot
148:32 - replace
148:33 - so i'm saying replace all that like the
148:35 - history with the back button url so the
148:38 - back button url
148:39 - now this will make a lot of sense now
148:42 - when we actually demo
148:43 - it so what's freaking out here
148:46 - i think everything's fine um yep
148:50 - so now if we go it's working hey look at
148:53 - that
148:53 - clean right wow yeah so look at this
148:55 - guys this switches between person
148:57 - and then it switches between that other
149:00 - um
149:01 - the other back button so i'm gonna click
149:03 - click here
149:04 - boom right there go home
149:09 - nice yeah
149:12 - awesome so that's a really clean way of
149:14 - doing it guys and that's actually going
149:16 - to give you
149:17 - um a very very nice ui user all
149:20 - luana says i love the way you guys make
149:23 - your content to even allow babies to
149:25 - follow along
149:26 - that is the goal that is the goal
149:29 - because i go to so many live streams and
149:30 - i watch so much content even on react
149:33 - and like
149:33 - it doesn't make any sense to me and i'm
149:35 - like i'm a developer
149:37 - and i'm watching react js tutorial or
149:40 - live stream if it doesn't make sense to
149:42 - me
149:42 - there's something wrong and so i'm like
149:45 - yeah i want to make it
149:46 - as what's up
149:53 - oh my god all right guys
149:57 - good talking to you i'm closing my
149:59 - laptop thank you for coming here
150:02 - oh that would actually be bad if i did
150:04 - that because the whole show
150:06 - don't close it yeah that would actually
150:08 - be so awful
150:09 - jesus naveen just yeah guys that's
150:12 - 20 euro i mean what i don't even know
150:16 - the chat revenue is like
150:17 - 50 or something now guys seriously thank
150:20 - you this is insane your guys's love is
150:23 - just
150:24 - it's freaking awesome yeah so so cool
150:27 - he says this is so cool guys when i
150:29 - started my career this is what i was
150:30 - missing i'm really enjoying this
150:32 - thank you so much dude you're welcome
150:35 - wow
150:36 - yeah and that's naveen because yeah and
150:38 - he seems like he's a developer and he
150:39 - currently has a job
150:41 - but yeah naveen would love to even have
150:44 - you on the skype call if you ever want
150:45 - to jump on just uh
150:47 - i think it's kazee underscore one one
150:50 - five something like that so you can
150:51 - skype me
150:52 - uh you can hit me up skype oh that'd be
150:55 - cool yeah
150:56 - that'd be cool right so guys
150:59 - we showed two ways of rooting we had the
151:01 - link to and we also had
151:03 - the uh on click with the history that
151:06 - replaced right
151:07 - so um that's pretty much the two ways
151:11 - that you can do it so we've showed that
151:12 - now so let's go ahead and build
151:14 - the chat the chats.js
151:18 - right so chat.js so if we go into app.js
151:21 - i'm actually going to change it so now
151:22 - we don't it's not very cool to say i am
151:23 - the chat page when we're on the chat
151:25 - page
151:26 - it's sort of like it's ugly so i'm going
151:28 - to create something here
151:29 - called chats so it's just going to be a
151:32 - component called chats this is why i
151:33 - love react it's super clean
151:35 - it's really nice like you don't have to
151:36 - worry about a very high
151:39 - look at this guys a high view so clean
151:42 - like it's so clean you can see exactly
151:44 - what's going on there's such a high view
151:45 - just
151:45 - render the chats that's it right i love
151:48 - that
151:49 - it's just so clean like i can never get
151:51 - over that so i'm going to create a new
151:52 - file now called chats.js
151:54 - and what i'm going to go ahead and do is
151:55 - do rfc yep
151:58 - i'm just going to say are you going to
151:59 - call it chats or chat
152:02 - no so this one we're going to call chats
152:04 - um
152:05 - reason being is because we're going to
152:07 - i'm going to actually have several
152:08 - chat components inside of it which are
152:11 - going to resemble the rows
152:12 - got it right so if we go ahead and look
152:15 - at the demo
152:16 - you'll see um okay
152:20 - uh yep so let's go ahead so we've got
152:23 - the chats here
152:25 - now what we're going to do is i'm going
152:27 - to say so chats is not defined so we go
152:29 - over here and we say
152:31 - import uh okay so it still doesn't work
152:34 - it's really annoying so
152:35 - i'm going to import chats from chats and
152:38 - now
152:40 - here i'm going to actually start coding
152:41 - up what the chat is going to be so
152:42 - remember guys
152:43 - always stick to your bem conventions so
152:45 - here we say class name
152:46 - equals chats nice and then we're going
152:49 - to actually go ahead and while we're
152:51 - doing this let's go ahead and create the
152:52 - css file so we're going to say chats
152:55 - chats.css there we go and i need to
152:57 - create that file so
152:59 - chats.css boom and we should pop into
153:02 - that file in a sec there we go
153:04 - nice so we've got that there and now
153:07 - what we're going to do guys
153:08 - is we are going to create so one what
153:10 - i'm envisioning here is that rather than
153:12 - having like
153:13 - the same code again and again and again
153:15 - and again and again
153:16 - we kind of have something like this we
153:19 - have like a chat
153:20 - right yeah like a sort of chat um it's
153:23 - a self-closing chat component but it
153:25 - will take something like this it'll take
153:27 - a name
153:28 - in this case we could have saved we
153:29 - could say like the name is like let's
153:30 - just say like mark for example
153:33 - the message could be something like
153:37 - yo what's up
153:41 - oops yo what's up the timestamp
153:45 - could be something like 40 seconds ago
153:50 - right the profile picture could be
153:53 - whatever it could be like you could just
153:54 - we could figure out what the profile
153:56 - picture was where it could be a url
153:58 - now at this point you would have a mess
154:01 - you'd have the name you'd have a message
154:03 - you'd have a timestamp and a proper
154:04 - picture and then this should just render
154:05 - out the row
154:06 - so if we go ahead and open up our app
154:12 - um because if we just go and open up our
154:14 - app
154:16 - what do you mean the the one we built
154:17 - already sorry yeah
154:19 - it goes it looks so much like the actual
154:21 - app but i forgot yeah
154:23 - we got this one so yeah what is this guy
154:25 - doing just busting my balls for no
154:26 - reason
154:28 - if we go to the one that we built though
154:30 - so the one that we yeah so the other one
154:33 - the one that's hosted online yeah yeah
154:35 - and then we go to the messages
154:37 - yep yep so you can see now we have four
154:41 - so so if we go back a level so if we
154:43 - have four
154:44 - chat components does that make sense
154:47 - we're passing different props in
154:49 - and this is just one component right
154:51 - yeah exactly
154:53 - cool so you see what we're doing here
154:55 - right so this is so this is going to be
154:57 - the
154:58 - this is going to be the chat component
155:00 - that we're building right now
155:02 - yes so why is it called chats that's
155:05 - what i'm not understanding like isn't it
155:06 - just one component like product
155:08 - and then you just keep you know like
155:10 - chat and then this is one and then this
155:12 - is two
155:13 - or three also called product products
155:16 - you could
155:16 - you could call it uh you could call it
155:18 - anything really in this case we could
155:19 - call it chat row
155:20 - maybe because this is going to be chat
155:22 - row and then the actual chat what i had
155:24 - is i had chat
155:25 - uh and then i actually had chat screen
155:27 - was for when you're on the chat screen
155:29 - all right okay got it this is all this
155:31 - is all down to preference guys like
155:32 - that's fine that's fine this is all good
155:34 - keep it keep it this is it
155:36 - it's all good yeah so here we could do
155:38 - this but basically the component that
155:40 - we're building
155:41 - chats is going to be this thing right
155:42 - here that's what chats
155:44 - is going to be exactly okay and then
155:47 - everywhere we call this like one word
155:50 - chats we'll have either ellen thing show
155:53 - up
155:53 - or sandra things show up right exactly
155:57 - got it yeah so now what i'm going to do
155:59 - is i'm actually going to go ahead and
156:00 - copy
156:01 - the snippet of code which had the which
156:03 - had basically all of those
156:05 - uh props in right so this is this we
156:07 - haven't created this chat component yeah
156:09 - we haven't created it yeah awesome
156:11 - naveen says definitely kazzy and sunny
156:13 - i'm working part-time right now and was
156:14 - having a part-time break yeah because i
156:16 - saw his message just a little bit
156:17 - earlier
156:18 - and yeah i think he's a professional
156:19 - developer who's working and he
156:22 - and he's like i took a break and i was
156:24 - watching the stream you guys made me
156:25 - happy
156:26 - thank you so much and then immerse
156:29 - frank frank just dropped 25 dude what
156:32 - where i don't see it whoa
156:37 - thank you dude
156:40 - it's at 86. it's like going
156:43 - what oh wrong maybe we just
156:46 - [ __ ] live stream and that's it don't
156:49 - even worry about anything else
156:50 - somebody also dropped five dollars um
156:53 - emerson did
156:54 - um it's it's just pen five i don't know
156:56 - what that means
156:58 - i don't know what currency that is pen
156:59 - five but thank you
157:01 - but he says react.js and aws amplify
157:04 - greetings from peru thank you thank you
157:07 - so much
157:08 - amazing jesus frank frank um
157:12 - hit hit us hit us up hit me up on
157:14 - instagram you know
157:15 - um that would be great i would love to
157:17 - have you guys even come on this and that
157:19 - on the show and jump in here yeah that'd
157:22 - be dope
157:24 - definitely um okay
157:27 - so we have the props here that's amazing
157:29 - thank you so much dude
157:30 - so we have the the four uh chat
157:32 - components with different props
157:34 - that have come up um and then we have so
157:37 - these this component isn't built yet
157:38 - right so let's go ahead and build that
157:40 - so let's create a chat.js so let's go
157:42 - ahead and do
157:44 - chat.js
157:46 - and this is going to be for each of
157:48 - those rows right so each of the rows
157:49 - that we spoke about so we're going to
157:50 - rfce
157:52 - um boom there we go chat okay and here
157:56 - what we can do is remember wait so there
157:58 - is a chat.js and then there's a
158:00 - chats.js yeah so chats is the one so
158:04 - chat is the view you're looking at
158:07 - ah that's what i was trying to get at so
158:08 - chats is what this entire
158:11 - box yes exactly and then
158:15 - to the rows got it okay okay all right
158:18 - but this is a component right
158:19 - yeah even though we're not really going
158:21 - to be reusing this component
158:24 - yeah so so this is a good example guys
158:26 - of even if you're not reusing something
158:29 - still build everything in a
158:31 - component-based fashion
158:32 - yes yeah first lead alone for
158:35 - speed alone and what and it's a really
158:38 - good point cause he brought up guys is
158:40 - um literally
158:42 - if you have this situation yeah what
158:45 - what we tend to do is we actually kind
158:47 - of have it as chats we usually have a
158:49 - pay
158:49 - a pages folder instead and that would be
158:53 - called like the chat screen or chats
158:54 - page if that makes sense and then you
158:56 - would have a components folder and that
158:58 - would be the chat component
158:59 - like you can make it very you can make
159:01 - it very sort of clear in that sense
159:02 - right
159:03 - um but let's carry on so we've got the
159:05 - chain so we've got the chat.js so here
159:08 - now what we're going to do is
159:09 - that took five different props right so
159:12 - i took five props they took the
159:13 - following
159:14 - so we had the following props inside of
159:16 - there we had
159:17 - name message profile pic and timestamp
159:20 - right
159:21 - yeah now inside of there what we're
159:24 - going to do
159:25 - is we're basically going to have the
159:26 - following so we're going to say uh
159:28 - firstly we're going to do bem so we're
159:30 - going to have class name
159:32 - equals chat and then what i'm going to
159:35 - say
159:35 - is inside of here i want to actually
159:38 - have
159:39 - the following so i want to have the um
159:42 - so i'm going to have
159:43 - the oh by the way by the way frank frank
159:45 - says
159:46 - he's a long time native app developer
159:50 - but all my new work is now react and
159:52 - react native
159:54 - and he goes this and the ig clone helped
159:57 - me kick start my
159:58 - mvp for an app called million fans
160:02 - oh frank frank he actually sent me an
160:04 - email
160:06 - really nice yeah he sent me an email oh
160:08 - my god this is the same guy nice dude
160:11 - yeah he sent me an email and he
160:12 - he said this exact same thing like he's
160:14 - he's building he helped him build his
160:16 - mvp fan app called million fans
160:18 - and his um his instagram is actually
160:22 - at francisco that
160:25 - so you guys check him out he seems like
160:27 - an awesome person and he seems and he's
160:29 - a developer so you guys can probably
160:30 - connect with him and learn
160:32 - a bunch as well and um as he launches
160:35 - this app maybe we can like go in and
160:37 - actually give that app five-star reviews
160:39 - and things like that just to support our
160:40 - community
160:42 - exactly 100 yeah
160:45 - vishal s just dropped another donation
160:47 - thank you so much dude
160:49 - jesus holy crap this is insane
160:52 - wow thank you guys thank you very much
160:54 - appreciate it thank you
160:56 - nice um awesome all right so now what
161:00 - we're going to do is guys
161:01 - uh you see on the left we have those
161:03 - like we have sarah ellen's andre in this
161:05 - hashtag
161:06 - they all have like a circle image right
161:07 - now we could do that so now that now
161:09 - just to be very clear chat is going to
161:12 - be this component right here
161:14 - yeah exactly okay okay got it so yeah
161:17 - now every time i do chat like ellen will
161:20 - come up okay cool
161:21 - got it yeah so we're gonna we really
161:23 - want it to be just about that sort of
161:25 - that circle right
161:26 - oh no sorry so the component right so
161:29 - now instead of hard coding
161:30 - that sort of circle and doing all the
161:32 - work around how do you get
161:34 - the radius to be a circle and stuff like
161:35 - that we can use material ui
161:38 - and material ui gives us something
161:39 - called an avatar
161:41 - right now avatar makes our life a lot
161:43 - easier so basically what we can do is we
161:45 - can import it like this
161:46 - so we just say import avatar from
161:48 - material i call avatar
161:50 - and then what we can do is we can
161:52 - actually go ahead and do the following
161:53 - so we can say
161:55 - so i'm going to go ahead and pop it in
161:57 - here so i'm going to say
161:58 - push an avatar here so an avatar the
162:00 - class name of chat image
162:02 - the alternate tag should be uh not it
162:04 - should be a name
162:05 - so basically they're very clever here so
162:08 - what it will do is it will take
162:10 - the name so let's just say it was rafae
162:12 - kazi
162:13 - and it would show an rf right if you if
162:17 - you don't have
162:18 - i see i see what you're saying so okay
162:20 - i'll let me draw that out
162:22 - so um this is pretty cool so how he's
162:24 - using this also it's like
162:26 - if you have an icon right normally it
162:29 - will show your face right here
162:31 - but if that face is not there then you
162:33 - might want to just
162:34 - have it show your initials or something
162:36 - so for me it might just be req
162:37 - so you guys have probably seen even on
162:39 - your imessages
162:41 - app on your you know iphone you'll see
162:44 - that
162:45 - p next to people's faces if you don't
162:47 - have their profile picture it'll
162:48 - actually just say something like this
162:50 - that's what we're trying to do right now
162:52 - exactly
162:55 - yeah exactly that that's a really good
162:56 - explanation here so it's like the uh
162:58 - the imessage stuff right um so what
163:02 - we're doing now is i'm actually going
163:03 - ahead and importing it into chat so it
163:05 - doesn't break
163:06 - so now what we can see is uh if we go
163:08 - ahead and check
163:09 - uh right now i'm actually passing in a
163:11 - profile picture for everyone but what
163:12 - i'm going to do is i'm going to
163:13 - deactivate that one
163:14 - and we should see if we open up our app
163:16 - now so the one that we're running
163:18 - locally
163:20 - yes give me one second i am you want me
163:22 - to okay i'll open that up right here
163:25 - yep we should be able to see so
163:28 - um it says name at the moment but name
163:32 - we do oh yeah i need to save it oops
163:34 - there we go
163:35 - let's save it
163:39 - so now we should see if you go to your
163:42 - messages
163:47 - nice so the chat component is actually
163:50 - starting to load so actually let's just
163:52 - compare them against each other
163:54 - so the component is loading
163:58 - yeah but the sarah one is not doing that
164:00 - thing we want it to do right now right
164:02 - yes it's strange it's not doing the
164:03 - thing that we exactly wanted it to do
164:05 - but if i would just want to test it
164:07 - i could just say something like let's
164:08 - say rafa kazi and let's just save it
164:11 - let's see how that handles and see what
164:12 - that does
164:15 - so interesting doesn't seem to do it so
164:17 - i think at this point there is a prop
164:19 - that i might be passing it incorrectly
164:21 - but we can go ahead and check that out
164:23 - uh a a different time but i think it
164:25 - might be okay that's okay let's just
164:27 - yeah that's all good yeah so in this
164:30 - case what we're gonna do
164:31 - is we're going to say the source is the
164:32 - profile picture right so if i go ahead
164:34 - and put that picture back we'll actually
164:36 - go ahead and we'll have everyone back in
164:37 - there so
164:38 - um there we go that should be yep there
164:41 - we go nice we've got that right
164:42 - now what we want to do is we want to
164:44 - have the uh the name
164:46 - and the the message that is that they
164:49 - sort of sent
164:50 - so here what we can say is i want to
164:51 - have it sort of containerized so i want
164:53 - to have three
164:54 - sort of children here so i want to have
164:56 - the um
164:58 - so if i create a div and i'm going to
165:00 - put inside this div i'm going to have a
165:01 - h2
165:02 - and i'm going to have the name so i'm
165:03 - going to have like whoever it was and
165:05 - i'm going to have
165:06 - a message underneath in a p tag so here
165:09 - i'm going to have a p
165:09 - tag so if we go ahead and save this now
165:13 - we should see an update and we should
165:14 - see some stuff
165:15 - okay that's clean and then let's have
165:18 - outside of that this have a timestamp
165:21 - so let's go ahead and say this is where
165:24 - the time stamp will go
165:25 - okay so now we have three children we
165:28 - have this we have this div
165:29 - and then we have this as a third chart
165:32 - okay
165:32 - so now we need to get this to look
165:35 - exactly as we had it previous in the
165:36 - other
165:37 - section right so how do we get that to
165:39 - work in the way that we need it to
165:41 - um we can basically go ahead okay so
165:44 - it's looking similar so basically so far
165:46 - we need uh just so we can have a clear
165:48 - roadmap what's happening
165:49 - but 35 minutes ago we'll probably need
165:52 - to go over here
165:52 - kind of like how we got it there yeah
165:56 - um okay i'll probably the text
165:59 - color i feel like needs to change a
166:00 - little bit and become a little
166:02 - not as dark black right a little bit
166:04 - lighter yeah
166:05 - exactly the 35 minutes ago is even
166:07 - lighter it's like
166:09 - almost like fading yep
166:12 - and um and i'm just i don't know i don't
166:15 - do much css so i'm just like calling it
166:17 - out kind of visually
166:18 - that's literally perfect yeah and even
166:20 - the spacing from the sides you see it's
166:22 - not exactly touching the side
166:23 - yeah yeah yeah that yeah exactly because
166:25 - here it's like touching in a super tight
166:27 - so like
166:28 - the spacing needs to change the image
166:30 - size i feel like is the same
166:33 - right and then got it and then there's
166:35 - like bunch of space right there
166:37 - padding or something margin right around
166:39 - here
166:40 - yeah and uh yeah and it seems like it
166:43 - also doesn't run across
166:44 - all the way it only runs to here
166:47 - exactly so it's got some like padding
166:49 - around the entire thing
166:51 - yep okay so i think the guys is that
166:54 - clear for you what
166:55 - were like how we're going from here to
166:57 - here
166:59 - like i i think i kind of understand what
167:00 - we're up to now
167:02 - yeah that's awesome nice okay so now
167:05 - what we're going to do is before we
167:06 - actually go ahead and start that let's
167:07 - give things that we need to sort of
167:08 - target
167:09 - appropriate class names so that way we
167:11 - can target them so here we're going to
167:12 - go ahead and say this is the chat
167:14 - details
167:14 - because it will basically have the name
167:17 - and the message right
167:18 - here i want to give this one a class
167:20 - name so i'm going to say this is a class
167:22 - name of timestamp so
167:24 - it's going to be chat timestamp
167:27 - right and that is actually should be
167:30 - everything that we need so we have the
167:31 - chat
167:31 - image the chat details and chat time
167:33 - some okay nice now we're gonna do is
167:35 - we're gonna go over to
167:36 - the uh we need to create input so we're
167:37 - gonna we got two new donations by the
167:39 - way
167:40 - uh super chat thank you guys so much for
167:42 - that that's enough as
167:43 - one appreciate that and then uh
167:46 - miha space gamer actually hrk 10 which
167:50 - is
167:50 - croatian um creation money so thank you
167:53 - from croatia
167:55 - thank you amazing thank you so much
168:00 - now what we want to do is we have the
168:03 - uh oh yeah we need to create the css so
168:05 - chat.css here
168:08 - so we pull that in and then we do chat
168:11 - dot css so we're going to pop into that
168:15 - file now there we go
168:16 - so now we need to style it guys so we've
168:18 - added all the sort of class names that
168:19 - we wanted
168:20 - so here's where the magic happens so now
168:22 - what we're going to do is if we have it
168:23 - open next to it we can see
168:25 - like how every sort of thing is going to
168:26 - die is going to affect it in real time
168:29 - which is going to be really nice right
168:30 - so
168:31 - here i'm going to do dot chat right
168:34 - and i'm going to say that's sick how
168:36 - we're doing this right now by the way
168:38 - this is
168:38 - like every css course i wish i had
168:41 - literally and this is going to show you
168:43 - guys perfectly like as it does it and
168:45 - when and it's going to do hot reloading
168:47 - and show you everything as it does it so
168:49 - display flex is going to do the
168:51 - following so it's going to
168:52 - push everything next to each other right
168:55 - so
168:56 - there we go really really nice way of
168:58 - doing that is display flex
169:00 - then we say align item center right and
169:03 - this will actually get
169:05 - the this will pull everything at central
169:07 - along the horizontal axis so
169:09 - so basically the spacing thing this
169:13 - uh no this one will actually get the
169:15 - timestamp to drop
169:16 - in line so everything will become
169:18 - centered along the horizontal axis so
169:20 - as soon as i hit wait wait wait
169:26 - okay hit it now do that so if i undo
169:28 - that you'll see
169:31 - you see that it pulls everything in the
169:33 - row
169:34 - to that center so and even the image
169:37 - came down right
169:38 - got it okay yeah and then the next one
169:41 - we're going to do
169:41 - is we're going to say justify content
169:44 - space between so space
169:46 - between yeah and now
169:49 - if i save that oh another cheat sheet
169:53 - moment space between
169:55 - so you're getting much more so it's
169:57 - already starting to get quite nice here
169:58 - so now i'm curious how you had you kept
170:00 - this more towards the left side
170:03 - yeah so that's actually a really good
170:04 - point that's coming that magic's coming
170:06 - so
170:07 - what we can do is we can say padding
170:10 - should be 20 pixels around this is this
170:12 - is what this is so
170:14 - that happens that little space on the
170:16 - left side of the photo
170:19 - that is looking clean bro it's good
170:22 - right
170:22 - and this is super clear for everyone
170:24 - guys if you find this sort of
170:25 - demonstration
170:26 - useful let us know by hitting the thumbs
170:29 - up button because
170:30 - that really is like this is we can
170:32 - definitely do this more often because i
170:33 - find this is actually
170:34 - super useful this is actually yeah crazy
170:37 - i mean i'm being blown away but
170:38 - elizabeth in the chat is like cs is my
170:40 - biggest nightmare and she goes thank you
170:42 - for this
170:43 - and then she also goes any tips with
170:44 - grid slash
170:46 - flex are welcome oh yeah group i mean we
170:49 - should definitely
170:50 - do some videos on grid soon because even
170:51 - i'm uh i'm sort of using grid
170:54 - and this 20 pixel by the way guys um i'm
170:56 - garbage with css and front end but
170:58 - this 20 pixels is like 20 in every
171:01 - direction right it's like
171:02 - freaking 20 and south east west
171:05 - north it's like 20 width height
171:09 - you know all of that 20 bottom top left
171:11 - and right right
171:12 - exactly yeah exactly and then now we're
171:16 - going to do the height
171:17 - and we're going to say it's 70 pixels so
171:20 - i'm going to have a height of 70 pixels
171:22 - and that should space them out a bit
171:23 - more so nice we actually had somebody
171:26 - enroll in
171:26 - profit with python right now oh awesome
171:30 - i saw yeah my phone pained nice
171:32 - beautiful
171:33 - and what we're going to do now is we're
171:35 - going to add a border bottom so this
171:37 - one's going to be super
171:39 - difficult to see but they actually have
171:40 - it on the app right so it's a very light
171:43 - gray
171:43 - so very very subtle gray um and then you
171:47 - actually couldn't see that pop in too
171:48 - well but if i go ahead and make it red
171:50 - you'll be able to see it so i actually
171:53 - added a line there but it's actually a
171:55 - super subtle gray so we want to make it
171:57 - this like
171:58 - really subtle gray here can you guys
172:00 - tell that it's like this really light
172:02 - gray
172:04 - really hard to tell i mean what we could
172:06 - do is we could i'll zoom in like insane
172:08 - i mean yeah now this should be able to
172:10 - tell yeah
172:11 - if i do a light gray you see it's too
172:13 - dark right like it's just yes it doesn't
172:15 - look
172:15 - too dark yeah so that that subtle sort
172:18 - of gray is gonna
172:19 - make a difference so there we go nice
172:22 - so dude front end is so crazy like how
172:26 - it goes from like
172:28 - looking like crap like i kind of never
172:29 - want to use it to like all of a sudden
172:31 - all i want to do is like click on it
172:33 - exactly it's crazy right like yeah so
172:35 - now that
172:36 - so a good point cause he brought up
172:38 - earlier is that we have
172:39 - how do we get where it says sarah and
172:42 - the message where it says ellen the
172:43 - message or it says sandra the message
172:44 - how do we get that
172:45 - to take up the majority of the space
172:47 - right so i read that's
172:50 - like a main reason as to why we wrapped
172:53 - those two things inside of something
172:54 - called chat details
172:56 - so we we made we got a div and we not
172:57 - wrapped in chat details so
172:59 - what i'm going to go ahead and do is say
173:01 - chat
173:02 - details flex
173:05 - one and what this will tell you is
173:09 - that container precedences and then give
173:12 - that container like the most
173:13 - weight right so now if i do that
173:16 - boom whoa wait
173:20 - hold on undo that i want to see
173:24 - what i want to just see what the hell
173:26 - happened
173:28 - you can comment the whole thing if you
173:29 - want okay
173:32 - all right so so many more wait wait hold
173:35 - on only
173:36 - this thing has the details thing on it
173:39 - the details class or whatever
173:41 - the chat details that's the container
173:43 - exactly with chat details
173:45 - but but that container doesn't have no
173:48 - that container has all of this right
173:50 - no so if we look back at the chat or js
173:54 - so you've got a chat then you've got
173:55 - chat image
173:58 - chat details is name and message and
174:00 - that's
174:01 - okay name okay hold on before you
174:02 - continue so chad details is basically
174:06 - these two things right here exactly
174:09 - these two things right there right
174:11 - yeah exactly now guys the reason why i
174:14 - did that is because if i get rid of this
174:15 - container
174:16 - i'll show you what happens right then we
174:18 - have four children
174:20 - inside of the chat uh container right
174:22 - which means
174:23 - okay that look what happens now so you
174:26 - now get a row
174:28 - that is not nice yeah we don't want this
174:31 - uh
174:31 - so what we do is we we bundle that those
174:33 - two items into its own container
174:36 - and then they start they they abide by
174:38 - the flex rules
174:39 - so go back go back okay okay so i got so
174:41 - i got what chat details is now go back
174:44 - to the css or whatever
174:46 - yep um okay and now you did flex
174:49 - one so what the hell does that do so
174:51 - that
174:52 - yeah takes this thing and and what makes
174:55 - it as long as it needs to be you said
174:58 - imagine imagine what happens now is each
175:01 - of those so the first
175:03 - imagine there's three children in each
175:04 - row the picture that chat details and
175:07 - then the time stamp right so okay
175:09 - before you continue so this is your
175:11 - child one
175:12 - this is child two and this is three is
175:15 - that what you're saying yeah
175:16 - exactly okay yeah now
175:19 - what we have is um so we have one
175:22 - somebody just said your live stream is
175:24 - already number one in youtube oh crap
175:26 - oh are you serious holy crap we might be
175:29 - we might be going
175:30 - yeah because we're at 27 000 views so
175:32 - that is amazing
175:34 - damn it dude and over 93 dollars in chat
175:37 - revenue that means multiple
175:39 - shirts as giveaways for you guys yeah
175:42 - dude that's insane
175:44 - that is bad all right so we have the
175:47 - flexor so right now we have those three
175:48 - things right and we said
175:50 - space between them right so it's good
175:54 - okay hold on hold on hold on so this is
175:56 - happening because
175:57 - of space between so i will just do s
176:01 - b cool yeah
176:04 - yeah uh-huh right so space between
176:08 - yep right now if i do flex
176:12 - one imagine what's gonna happen is
176:15 - the chat details i'm applying flex one
176:18 - to the chat details right
176:20 - so what's gonna happen is it's going to
176:23 - push as much room as it can
176:27 - and take up as much room as it can so
176:29 - this so imagine the whole for the chat
176:31 - detail so so basically we're saying give
176:33 - higher priority to chat details which is
176:35 - the second child
176:37 - and make it take as much of the room as
176:40 - it
176:40 - can exactly so we're basically
176:43 - so it looks like what i circled is it
176:46 - looks like this but it's actually taking
176:48 - up
176:48 - all this room here so if i go this is
176:51 - still the second one
176:53 - this is one and then this is three right
176:55 - there right
176:56 - yep ah so oh that's really good yeah so
177:00 - this
177:01 - shows you after we apply flex one so
177:03 - before
177:04 - it was actually before applying flex one
177:07 - it was actually like this then after
177:10 - applying flex one
177:11 - it actually becomes this big thing
177:14 - exactly
177:16 - nice okay i
177:19 - yeah that's a really nice visual way of
177:21 - showing it yeah that's awesome
177:23 - and then like now if i go ahead and do
177:25 - if i uncomment here
177:27 - watch how it snaps and it takes up as
177:30 - much room as it can
177:31 - this is awesome i'm gonna take a
177:33 - screenshot of this literally
177:36 - let me let me undo it and then you can
177:37 - do it so there you go
177:39 - there you go you ruined my screenshot
177:43 - no that's right all right cool i got the
177:46 - screenshot i'm gonna drop it in my slack
177:48 - just so i have it actually i'll drop it
177:50 - in
177:51 - both of our slacks so we have it nice
177:55 - cool right so the next step guys
177:58 - is we're going to use that but then you
178:00 - see the spacing is kind of off right so
178:02 - yeah people are saying like this
178:04 - is wow this is amazing maurice is saying
178:07 - i think they're really enjoying the
178:09 - visuals
178:10 - amazing love that so now guys what we're
178:13 - going to do is we're going to say
178:14 - that the chat image should have a margin
178:17 - right of 20 pixels
178:18 - so to the right of the image push it 20
178:21 - pixels so
178:22 - uh oh no so let me uh unsave that
178:25 - so keep keep the app up yeah so now if i
178:28 - if i
178:28 - save it so i'm going to put in margin
178:30 - right of 20 pixels
178:32 - and there you go wow yeah
178:36 - now oh prasad said that it's true your
178:39 - team is god's of god's hat software
178:41 - hey love them yeah thank you yes
178:44 - uh and then what we're going to say is
178:46 - that so now we're going to show you
178:48 - how you can target something um slightly
178:51 - different in css we're going to say
178:52 - inside the chat details
178:54 - target the first uh child which is a um
178:57 - what are we doing what are we doing why
178:59 - are we doing this hold on before we
179:00 - continue
179:01 - what's happening so so what we're doing
179:03 - here is you see where it says hey how
179:04 - are you
179:05 - we're trying to make it like lighter
179:07 - yeah we're trying to make it lighter
179:09 - got it okay so okay so visually what's
179:11 - happening is i am going i'm gonna
179:14 - select this guy here chat details
179:17 - and then within this guy i'm going to
179:19 - select
179:20 - hey how are you exactly okay
179:23 - so because it's a p tag got it got it so
179:27 - chat details get me
179:28 - gets me access to that higher level
179:30 - thing and then
179:31 - the greater than sign and then p
179:33 - basically says hey get me the p
179:34 - tag which is this guy here yo
179:39 - beautiful got it perfect all right and
179:41 - then if i do command
179:43 - s is all i mean save so boom
179:46 - it's so crazy it's like i get it what
179:49 - you're saying
179:50 - and so that's how i'm able to then draw
179:52 - out the visual
179:54 - but once i see the visual is actually
179:56 - when i
179:57 - really get it for the first time yeah no
180:00 - it's true and honestly like when you're
180:01 - doing these visuals i think it's
180:02 - benefiting
180:03 - so many people right now because um yeah
180:06 - it's it's really going to help and guys
180:08 - just worth noticing that that little
180:10 - uh crocodile sign the one next to the p
180:13 - tag is saying it
180:14 - has to be a direct child right so steve
180:17 - mccarthy added that a really good
180:18 - comment
180:19 - has to be a direct child which means it
180:21 - has to be
180:22 - right inside of that container the first
180:24 - child of that container right
180:26 - yep exactly right so next we're going to
180:29 - say the chat time stamp
180:30 - so you see where it says 35 minutes ago
180:33 - it's slightly dark right now
180:35 - right so i haven't saved this this line
180:37 - yeah so as soon as i
180:38 - click save the timestamp where it says
180:41 - 35 minutes ago
180:42 - is now going to become that light gray
180:45 - just like that one right there yeah
180:48 - okay yes hit it like save
180:52 - boom unsave and save do it a few times
180:55 - so unsave and save
181:00 - there you go nice okay beautiful perfect
181:04 - yeah so there we go that that's really
181:06 - really nice and that works
181:08 - pretty clean right so that's cool
181:11 - so now we actually uh have finished
181:14 - there so the one
181:16 - that is done yeah so i think that's done
181:19 - yeah awesome
181:20 - um we need to actually have it so that
181:22 - each of these are clickable
181:24 - right now yeah so two questions here
181:27 - one how do we make it clickable we use
181:29 - something called react where we use that
181:30 - same link
181:32 - that we used earlier second thing is
181:34 - where does it go to what url does it go
181:36 - to right
181:37 - so what we're going to do is we're first
181:39 - we're going to define what url it goes
181:40 - to so
181:42 - by the way guys just real quick if you
181:44 - guys are enjoying this
181:45 - you know let us know in the comments
181:47 - below let's keep the energy
181:49 - moving every time i see a drop i just
181:51 - want to come in and make sure all your
181:52 - guys's energy is high because that's how
181:54 - you're going to be able to retain all
181:55 - this
181:56 - so energy up if you need to stand up
181:58 - stand up you need to grab water go do
182:00 - that right this second
182:00 - come right back but guys we're almost at
182:03 - the finish
182:04 - line we're gonna you're gonna see the
182:06 - entire completed version right
182:09 - and it's gonna be very satisfying to be
182:10 - able to see how
182:12 - this entire app is built so just don't
182:15 - lose sight
182:16 - of what we're actually working on we're
182:17 - almost there so keep the energy there
182:20 - uh smash the like button so we can
182:21 - actually like just keep breaking this
182:23 - youtube algorithm where
182:24 - we are at 28 000 views and just drop a
182:27 - comment below
182:28 - you know and keep the energy going so
182:29 - thank you guys yeah
182:31 - exactly thank you so much guys for the
182:34 - support and
182:34 - all of the all of you guys who have been
182:36 - there for most of the video like
182:37 - appreciate you guys so much
182:39 - seriously so damn much thank you
182:42 - nice so now what we're going to do is
182:43 - we're going to add the third room right
182:45 - so this is going to be the route where
182:47 - when you're on that chat screen and you
182:49 - click one of those rows
182:51 - you're actually going to go into that
182:53 - chat right so you're going to go inside
182:54 - of that chat so
182:55 - yeah for example when you click that
182:57 - it's going to go inside of that chart so
182:59 - that's right what we need to do is i'm
183:00 - going to define a root so oops so what
183:02 - i'm going to do is make life easier i'm
183:03 - going to copy this route
183:05 - paste it and i'm going to change this
183:06 - one now so it will have a header
183:09 - inside of that but this one won't go
183:11 - back to the home screen it'll go back to
183:13 - the chat screen
183:15 - wait what wait wait wait okay so what's
183:17 - happening
183:18 - okay okay so just to be clear so when
183:20 - i'm in chat
183:21 - and i'm in ellen then when i hit this
183:24 - back button right here it shouldn't take
183:26 - me to the home screen right
183:27 - it should take me back got it so if i
183:30 - hit this
183:31 - back to chat cool exactly if i hit it
183:34 - back
183:34 - that way and then what we're going to do
183:38 - is the actual path
183:40 - right so when we're on that ln
183:41 - conversation that path
183:44 - we actually want to have a dynamic wild
183:46 - card here and what i mean by that is i
183:48 - want
183:49 - i want anything to be able to go in
183:50 - front of here and this would be a valid
183:53 - url
183:54 - right so this could say ellen this could
183:56 - say sandra
183:58 - this could say mark this could say jeff
184:01 - right it doesn't matter at this point
184:03 - but i want that to be a wild card so
184:04 - here
184:05 - what i could say is i could say person
184:10 - right and this little colon represents
184:14 - um a wild card so it's saying like any
184:16 - value can go here
184:18 - and that would be a valid url so now
184:22 - let's take a look at what's happening
184:24 - here so if i go into
184:26 - some person it actually says slash chat
184:30 - slash ellen got it exactly yeah
184:33 - which is really nice and it also gives
184:35 - like a very clean fill right so now
184:37 - what i can say is just to test it we can
184:39 - say h string say it works
184:41 - right so now if we go over to say
184:45 - forward slash chat and say forward slash
184:48 - um let's just do four slash sunny or
184:50 - something
184:50 - uh-huh oh nice it says it works right
184:54 - here at the bottom
184:56 - awesome right can i can i use that
184:58 - person variable
185:00 - right here uh you can um
185:03 - how we extract it would be easier to
185:05 - show inside of a
185:06 - in a component got it okay yeah
185:10 - mel mela okay man i'm gonna butcher this
185:14 - name but i'm gonna
185:14 - give it a try melilani says you guys are
185:18 - amazing guys you are amazing guys i
185:20 - probably wouldn't have started this
185:21 - journey
185:22 - without all your inspiration and no
185:25 - developer on youtube
185:27 - is putting massive content like you guys
185:30 - um thank you so much but really our goal
185:33 - right now is just to
185:35 - like provide as much value as humanly
185:38 - possible for however long we do this
185:40 - we've completely changed the standards
185:42 - for ourselves
185:43 - we're not even looking at what other
185:44 - people are doing we've changed our
185:46 - standards to like what if we just
185:48 - did it the best anybody has ever done
185:50 - and just provided the most amount of
185:52 - value
185:52 - in the developer world and produced the
185:54 - most developers on the planet
185:56 - i think that'd be pretty damn cool yeah
185:58 - hundred percent
186:00 - like the fact that we've already getting
186:01 - so many people coding like that's
186:04 - enough of a thank you for us like that
186:06 - we can see like we love that guys and we
186:08 - love that you guys are enjoying this and
186:09 - finding value in it
186:11 - yeah thank you awesome so now guys we
186:14 - have
186:15 - this uh chat for like person and it
186:18 - worked right
186:19 - obviously we don't want to show the
186:20 - chats again we want to actually show a
186:22 - chat screen
186:23 - so in this case rather than saying it
186:25 - works i'm going to render
186:27 - a chat screen here right so this is
186:30 - going to be the actual chat screen
186:32 - all right so we're going to render a
186:34 - chat screen so i need to actually go
186:35 - ahead and create that so
186:36 - chat screen dot js
186:40 - yeah yep there we go chat screen.js and
186:43 - now
186:44 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to go
186:45 - ahead and firstly import that so
186:48 - go here boom let's just quickly change
186:51 - this to chat
186:51 - screen and save
186:56 - and then we go to chat screen and then
186:57 - we'll do rfce because we love that
186:59 - little trick
187:01 - and then there we go now we have the
187:02 - chat screen right so the chat screen is
187:04 - going to be the screen that you guys saw
187:06 - wow it looks nice yeah so it's going to
187:08 - be that screen that we saw earlier
187:11 - hey expected an error oh nice
187:14 - yeah so now like this is going to be the
187:16 - chat screen so if we do h2
187:18 - say like i was about to type in error
187:22 - chat screen so now we should see that
187:26 - chat screen pops up on that page right
187:28 - nice which is okay and the chat screen
187:31 - is this screen that we're trying to
187:33 - build right now yeah
187:34 - exactly that yeah yeah so we want to get
187:38 - to that point
187:39 - and um so now what we can do is firstly
187:42 - let's go ahead and apply some cards we
187:43 - need to do the class name let's just say
187:45 - chat screen that's always our sort of
187:46 - go-to
187:47 - habit we want to form and then the
187:49 - second step now is we actually need to
187:51 - build that chat screen so
187:53 - here what we've done is we actually need
187:55 - to
187:56 - basically what i'm going to do is i'm
187:57 - going to draft it out right so firstly
187:58 - i'm going to say
188:00 - um we're going to have some some piece
188:01 - of like we need to keep track of the
188:04 - messages that are going to come in right
188:05 - we need to keep track of like
188:07 - if it says if like if ellen sends a
188:09 - message or if something like that we
188:11 - want to see
188:12 - who's actually sending that message in
188:14 - right so at this point what we can do is
188:16 - we can say const
188:17 - and we can say messages and we can say
188:20 - set
188:21 - messages so i'm just creating music and
188:23 - creating a piece of state here for
188:25 - to keep track of the messages that are
188:28 - being sent back and forth
188:29 - and we're going to have an empty uh
188:31 - we're going to have an array here right
188:33 - now each message is going to be an
188:35 - object
188:36 - it's going to have the user's name
188:40 - so we can have the user's name so in
188:41 - this case let's say allen
188:43 - it's going to have the image of the user
188:46 - so this could be the source of the image
188:48 - and it's going to have a message so in
188:51 - this case it could say
188:52 - like why do we need the name of the
188:58 - oh so we could actually pull the name
189:00 - from but i'm trying to mimic what the
189:01 - database
189:03 - what you would actually be pulling in
189:04 - you know okay
189:06 - because i mean i'm just asking because
189:07 - we don't show name anywhere in the chat
189:09 - screen right
189:11 - oh yeah we don't actually show the name
189:13 - well we we do kind of because it says
189:15 - you matched with that
189:16 - ah okay got it but but
189:19 - but you're right actually there we can
189:20 - actually grab that from the
189:22 - not the message so yeah at this point we
189:24 - can get rid of this
189:25 - yep cool um
189:28 - actually no okay so uh no just leave it
189:31 - leave it leave because it seems like
189:32 - we're
189:32 - we are using it so that's great yeah so
189:35 - here
189:35 - we could do it we just have something
189:37 - like this and yeah so what's up and then
189:39 - we could have another message
189:42 - saying um let's just do this
189:45 - and then here it could be something like
189:48 - um
189:49 - what have we got on the other one we've
189:50 - got how's it going so how's it going
189:55 - yeah and then we've got another message
189:56 - so what i'm going to do is just to show
189:58 - a demonstration here guys
189:59 - this is going to be pure we're going to
190:01 - show you like a a sort of a mock of how
190:04 - you can pretty much get it to a point if
190:05 - you can style like the difference
190:07 - between a sender and a receiver so
190:09 - if you're the person sending it or if
190:10 - you're not show you the logic of how you
190:12 - can do that so
190:13 - let's imagine if it was you you're not
190:15 - going to have the
190:16 - name and image you're just going to have
190:17 - the message so this is going to be the
190:19 - messages from ellen
190:20 - but this is going to be the message from
190:22 - you right and
190:23 - at this point in time it's just three
190:25 - objects and they're just
190:26 - all of them resemble messages one two of
190:29 - them have
190:30 - the name and the image and one of them
190:31 - just doesn't have anything it just has
190:32 - the message itself
190:34 - okay so what i'm going to go ahead and
190:36 - do is firstly i'm just going to go ahead
190:38 - and actually get an image but so that
190:39 - way
190:40 - this makes a bit more sense we can go
190:42 - ahead and do this
190:43 - so that's a huge image for for ellen
190:47 - so we can do that okay
190:51 - perfect and now what we're going to do
190:52 - is we're going to actually start coding
190:54 - this so
190:55 - we've got the preparation done and what
190:57 - we're going to do is the first thing
190:59 - we're going to say is you matched with
191:01 - like let's say in this one we're going
191:02 - to so we're going to hard code it a
191:04 - little bit here just for demonstrations
191:05 - we're going to say
191:07 - let's have a p tag at the top right
191:08 - let's have a p tag which says
191:11 - you matched with ellen on some random
191:13 - date right so let's go ahead and say
191:15 - this so you matched with ellen
191:17 - on 10th of 00 20th or something like
191:20 - that right
191:21 - and what we're going to do is we're
191:23 - going to get rid of this so
191:24 - now if we bring up our app quasi so we
191:27 - show r1
191:32 - right so it says use state is not
191:33 - defined so we actually need to go ahead
191:34 - and import that so
191:36 - use state oh god whoa what the hell just
191:40 - happened there
191:43 - there you go oh nice somebody gave us a
191:46 - another super chat he's a give us a
191:49 - video for react virtualized
191:50 - i need to write virtualized group
191:52 - gallery i've heard of react virtualized
191:54 - you can definitely have a look at it and
191:55 - if it's something that a lot of people
191:57 - are interested in we can definitely have
191:58 - a look at and build something like that
191:59 - yeah
191:59 - sure um what is that um i've used that i
192:03 - think it's like
192:05 - uh some kind of list thing so react
192:08 - virtualized was it react
192:10 - proficiently rendering large lists and
192:12 - tabular data
192:13 - i see oh retail uses it
192:17 - yeah oh nice oh i mean rito renders his
192:20 - list quite small
192:22 - slow yeah it's super slow yeah
192:25 - um nice so you match with ellen on this
192:28 - day okay so that's cool
192:30 - now what we could do is um
192:33 - so let's go ahead and just do
192:37 - okay so it says you matched event so if
192:39 - you go to our app quasi so if we go to
192:41 - ford so
192:42 - forward slash chat forward slash ellen
192:48 - by the way somebody said we should do
192:50 - some machine learning stuff on here
192:51 - we should that'd be sick but oh nice i
192:53 - see that you're pulling you mash with
192:55 - ellen
192:58 - yeah awesome and i'll show i'll show you
193:01 - how we can actually
193:02 - uh grab it from the um the url
193:05 - right so yeah we'll do that afterwards
193:08 - we'll just afterwards i would i will do
193:09 - that at the end though
193:10 - but we can say you match with ellen on
193:11 - this day and now what we're going to do
193:13 - is we're actually going to render out
193:14 - those messages
193:15 - we are only 1 000 away from 30 000 views
193:19 - no 1 000 away from 30 000 views
193:23 - what the hell guys text your mom
193:26 - like hey jump on this text your brother
193:28 - like literally get everybody on this
193:30 - let's break thirty thousand that's never
193:32 - happened before
193:34 - and just right now just smash that like
193:36 - button because that's just gonna keep
193:37 - pushing it out thank you thank you thank
193:38 - you
193:39 - thank you so much yeah amazing
193:42 - so now guys we're going to render out
193:44 - the messages right so we're going to say
193:45 - for every single message so map through
193:48 - for each message
193:49 - i want to oops i want to render
193:53 - let's go ahead and say um i want to
193:56 - render out
193:57 - a so a div because i'm just going to
194:00 - have a container around the message
194:01 - itself
194:02 - so i'm going to say a div with a p tag
194:05 - so oops
194:05 - my image is not working so deep with a p
194:07 - tag
194:08 - yep and then i'm going to say that's
194:11 - going to basically just say like
194:13 - uh it's going to use the message dot
194:15 - message so you see this one here
194:17 - just looping through them and then we're
194:19 - going to get that message
194:20 - and i'm going to get it and say message
194:22 - dot message
194:24 - right so now if i save this uh we're
194:26 - freaking out here because we've got a

194:35 - unclosed here there we go
194:38 - so if i save that now
194:43 - wait hold on i wasn't talking about your
194:45 - code but your code is awesome too
194:48 - i was saying um somebody just in instant
194:51 - money all-star just donated uh 11 in
194:54 - super chat
194:56 - and he says y'all guys your guys and
194:58 - work is amazing
195:00 - trying to keep up lol this is why i
195:02 - choose the computer science career i
195:03 - could never be satisfied with just using
195:06 - web applications
195:07 - not knowing how it was coded
195:10 - that's insane thank you so much instant
195:12 - money all star
195:14 - this is why i choose because i like
195:15 - number seven
195:17 - nice yep this is why we show you guys
195:19 - how really all of this works behind the
195:21 - scenes and the logic behind it you know
195:23 - so then you can then build your own
195:26 - yeah exactly but thank you really love
195:28 - the support
195:29 - and i think we're about to break um i
195:32 - think we broke probably a hundred

195:35 - so that's freaking amazing thank you
195:36 - guys thank you
195:38 - right nice did we just break the ak
195:43 - no 29 000 on views

196:24 - streams recorded here for all of you
196:25 - guys yeah
196:27 - so we'll be here always um
196:31 - okay so at that point what we can do is
196:33 - i'm gonna go ahead and
196:34 - style this a little bit so it looks a
196:36 - little nicer than this
196:38 - so right now we've got three messages
196:39 - and it says you match with ellen so we
196:41 - may be getting there
196:42 - somewhat but it's not like i do right
196:44 - it's not what we want to get to and as
196:46 - an end result so
196:47 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
196:48 - give the uh div i'm going to give it a
196:51 - class name of oh we've got some nice new
196:53 - donations in thank you
196:56 - awesome thank you uh and we've got to
196:58 - screen a message
197:00 - so we've got a chat screen message and
197:01 - you can see
197:03 - um yeah so we're gonna start that one
197:05 - there
197:06 - and we've also got the uh yeah so i'm
197:09 - gonna go ahead and start starting this
197:10 - one so
197:11 - what we need to do is in order to style
197:13 - it we need to do a little neat trick so
197:14 - we need to actually import a
197:16 - chatscreen.css file i'm going to do that
197:19 - and save it and then i'm going to go
197:20 - here and actually go to chat
197:22 - screen dot css
197:26 - and this will pop in nice and what we
197:29 - want to do now is actually go ahead and
197:31 - make it a little bit more
197:33 - uh nicer to look at so i'm just going to
197:35 - pull up some codes with a chat
197:37 - screen.css
197:39 - so here now what i'm going to do is i'm
197:40 - going to say that the message
197:43 - itself should actually have so right now
197:46 - we've got um
197:49 - this this this code up so it actually
197:52 - looks a bit more like how we have it so
197:53 - we have the avatar
197:54 - then we have the message and then we
197:56 - have that nice little bubble around it
197:58 - right
197:59 - so to get that little bubble
198:02 - next to it the way we do it is we
198:04 - basically have it so that
198:06 - oh the bubble when you say bubble you're
198:08 - talking about this bubble here
198:11 - yes that beautiful little looking
198:13 - message bubble and immediately when you
198:14 - see that
198:15 - it looks like a message right yeah so
198:18 - and also a little avatar with ellen on
198:20 - it right
198:21 - so we have the the message so we put
198:24 - we imported the avatar and then what
198:26 - we're going to do is we need to go ahead
198:28 - and
198:29 - um i'm going to go ahead and i'm going
198:31 - to basically
198:33 - pop this in here inside the message so
198:35 - next to the message itself
198:37 - i'm going to have the avatar and i'm
198:39 - going to say that the
198:40 - class name is chat screen image and i'm
198:42 - going to say the
198:43 - alternative thing is message.name so
198:46 - it's going to be lenny says
198:47 - i can't believe i have been here for
198:49 - more than three hours and i'm learning
198:51 - every minute

198:58 - love that kyle says
199:01 - i'm sorry sunny but they're these are

199:40 - coaching calls so
199:42 - you're pretty much gonna get a chance to
199:43 - ask whatever questions you want and to
199:45 - really
199:46 - like dial in on those pain points that
199:48 - you're having when it comes to your
199:49 - development journey
199:51 - yeah awesome nice so
199:54 - now we've actually pulled in the avatar
199:56 - by saying use the message
199:58 - image if they have it otherwise use the
200:00 - name so now it actually pulls in the
200:01 - images we've got ln popping up
200:03 - that's nice nice
200:06 - from right here exactly so you can see
200:08 - image that's really cool
200:11 - yep and then what we want to have is
200:14 - the actual um so right now yeah so let's
200:17 - go ahead and give that little
200:18 - that sort of bubble around it because
200:20 - that bubble around it gives it a nice
200:22 - sort of fill
200:23 - to it right so now let's go ahead
200:27 - yes the bubble so let's go ahead and say
200:29 - that this p
200:30 - tag has a class name of chat screen text
200:34 - right so it has chat screen text and now
200:37 - what i'm gonna say is
200:39 - uh let's go ahead and style it and i'm
200:40 - gonna say for chat screen oops
200:42 - for um chat screen
200:45 - underscore text
200:49 - so for that oops for that
200:52 - what i'm going to say is we wanted to
200:53 - have up so if because if you want to
200:55 - bring it up to the left i love doing css
200:57 - when they can see it you know that as it
200:59 - pops
200:59 - yes yes yes yes yeah so here we can say
201:03 - margin
201:04 - left right so margin left um and then we
201:07 - can say margin left as 10 pixels so as
201:10 - soon as i hit save you'll see that this
201:11 - is going to pop some
201:13 - margin left right there okay but before
201:16 - we actually go ahead and carry on with
201:17 - that what i'm actually going to do is
201:19 - where we've got the um chat screen
201:22 - itself so not the chat screen we need to
201:25 - actually go ahead and do
201:27 - um chat screen input form okay yep so
201:30 - what we need to go ahead and do is
201:32 - actually style it so that the
201:34 - um have i done that i forgot i've
201:37 - completely forgot for a sec
201:39 - yeah there we go yeah so now we actually
201:41 - got the chat screen here
201:42 - and what we want to do is we basically
201:44 - need it so that
201:46 - each of those things is going to be so
201:49 - you see where it's got ellen's picture
201:50 - right
201:51 - we want that to be next to the text not
201:54 - underneath there right so and so the way
201:57 - we do that is we actually go ahead and
201:59 - target chat screen message and
202:02 - here we go and say chat screen message
202:05 - and we say display flex
202:09 - so now if i do that boom it should go
202:11 - next to it
202:12 - nice now we know if they don't align in
202:15 - the on the vertical side
202:17 - item yeah hey i'm picking this up
202:22 - that's it dude there we go nice and then
202:25 - we have that
202:26 - and then we can also say let's give it a
202:29 - padding of 20 pixels right
202:30 - so that way it has some space itself and
202:33 - it's not like all scrumped up like
202:34 - that there we go we got that space
202:37 - that's looking great
202:38 - yeah there's already signs look really
202:40 - clean really nice
202:42 - um and now what we're going to do is
202:43 - we're going to go ahead and give the
202:45 - text a background color of gray light
202:47 - gray
202:49 - so there we go so by the way guys here
202:52 - is the url
202:53 - so you guys can play with this a little
202:55 - bit i'm popping this up here so you guys
202:57 - can
202:58 - pause it and go but we're not gonna be
203:01 - putting it in the description because
203:03 - youtube took down our video last time
203:05 - for popping it in the description
203:08 - yeah they didn't like that and just for
203:10 - disclaimer this is not the real tinder
203:13 - like this is clone fake
203:16 - this is what we built for demoing geez
203:21 - we're not about to get another strike on
203:22 - this channel
203:24 - yeah the youtube gods um so we added a
203:28 - background color and now guys this is
203:29 - the magic of front end right
203:31 - so let's let's go ahead and have both
203:32 - apps open side by side so that we can
203:34 - see as we code the css
203:37 - so right now look how ugly that looks
203:38 - right oh wow that is
203:40 - that is nice two lines of code so by
203:44 - adding
203:44 - a padding of 15 pixels
203:48 - yeah so if i add the padding of 15
203:49 - pixels
203:53 - what and add water just with padding it
203:56 - already works
203:58 - yeah literally it's crazy and a border
203:59 - radius to 20 pixels
204:01 - and boom oh man
204:05 - that is crazy that i got to actually see
204:07 - the magic behind how to make text look
204:09 - good and that's so easy
204:11 - that is so easy and it's crazy wow like
204:14 - it literally just like blows your mind
204:15 - and
204:15 - like how small things can really make
204:17 - such a big difference like
204:20 - crazy damn that is nice i love that okay
204:23 - great and now what else is left this
204:25 - needs to be centered
204:26 - this needs to be lighter uh and the blue
204:30 - thing
204:30 - needs to be here yeah so for the user's
204:33 - messages
204:34 - comes up on the right so it's not a
204:36 - message like is ellen's
204:37 - right yep
204:41 - so now what we're going to do is we're
204:42 - going to go here we're going to give a
204:43 - class name to this one so i'm going to
204:44 - say class name
204:46 - class name is chat screen timestamp
204:51 - and i'm going to go here and i'm going
204:52 - to go back and say for the time stamp
204:55 - we're going to do text align center
205:00 - and that will pop it into the center
205:03 - i'm going to give it a padding of 20
205:04 - pixels and a color of gray
205:07 - got it and look at this
205:10 - wow lovely to see beautiful
205:14 - literally like slowly comes together
205:16 - right so satisfying
205:18 - yeah really really nice like um so
205:21 - that's awesome
205:22 - we have that done and now what we're
205:24 - going to do is actually
205:25 - implement the logic which will show us
205:28 - that if it is
205:29 - if they if there is no name inside the
205:31 - message so if it's
205:33 - if it's one of our own messages let's
205:35 - actually go ahead
205:36 - and make it look a bit different so it
205:38 - pulls to the right as opposed to pulling
205:40 - to the left
205:41 - right so the way that we're going to do
205:43 - this and it's very sort of simple way
205:44 - that we're doing it
205:45 - and obviously in production apps like
205:47 - you can change this and it might be
205:48 - different depending on how you set your
205:50 - app up
205:50 - but in our case what we're going to do
205:52 - is we're going to say if if there is a
205:54 - name
205:55 - inside of the message so if it says like
205:57 - if it has a name key
205:58 - then it's a message from ellen right but
206:00 - if there's no name it's a message from
206:02 - us
206:02 - so imagine this was the back end this
206:04 - was how our database was set up
206:06 - that's how it would be passed through so
206:08 - what we would be doing is we would be
206:10 - saying if message
206:11 - dot uh user so there's a name sorry
206:15 - message.name so just
206:16 - just to like at a high level is
206:18 - basically like if
206:20 - it's not you then it's gray and if it is
206:23 - you then it's blue right
206:25 - yeah exactly cool okay so we're
206:29 - basically gonna check like
206:30 - hey if it's the user who's currently
206:33 - typing then blue
206:35 - yep okay cool exactly that so if it's
206:39 - your message it comes up as blue
206:41 - right so we're saying if when we're
206:43 - iterating through it if there is a
206:45 - name property then it's going to be
206:49 - the um then it will be a case of it's
206:52 - the um
206:54 - it's the user's message isn't it it's
206:57 - the
206:57 - it's ellen's message think of it right
206:59 - now we're just checking without
207:00 - we're not checking based on ids right
207:02 - we're just checking based on like name
207:04 - so if like if the name is sunny and okay
207:07 - then it's okay so right now we're just
207:09 - checking if the name is passed in so
207:11 - imagine we had three we had three uh
207:14 - messages here two of them had a name
207:16 - right so it was ellen because
207:18 - we were speaking to her but the one with
207:20 - us didn't have name it just had a
207:21 - message
207:24 - right so the data structure was slightly
207:25 - different and this could be different
207:27 - depending on how you set up
207:28 - right as in like how you set your app
207:30 - but we're just doing it as a demo to
207:31 - show you like this is one way
207:33 - right so now what we're doing is
207:36 - so you see like the one that the one
207:38 - that we for the message that it wasn't
207:40 - so for the message it was for us
207:42 - you see like i got rid of the avatar so
207:44 - it's already working our logic is sort
207:46 - of working here so
207:47 - now you can see the third message
207:49 - doesn't have an avatar
207:51 - so it falls into this code bucket here
207:53 - right
207:54 - so now what we can do is we can actually
207:57 - go ahead and just
207:58 - apply a different so instead of applying
208:01 - text i'm going to say apply text user
208:05 - for that one right so this is the normal
208:07 - when it's sort of ellen sends a message
208:08 - but when we send the message back it's
208:10 - text user
208:11 - so now you can see it's basic because
208:13 - it's lost that styling right
208:14 - yeah so for text user i'm going to apply
208:17 - the following so i'm going to say
208:18 - and we'll have this open on the side so
208:20 - we'll say chat screen text user so
208:23 - just green text user here i'm going to
208:25 - say
208:26 - i'm going to give a margin left of order
208:28 - so this is the magic to making it push
208:30 - to the right
208:30 - so let's have it um let's have it open
208:33 - yes if we do margin left auto oh wow
208:36 - left auto interesting whoa
208:39 - because margin left is saying like you
208:41 - determine if whenever
208:42 - if you ever want to push something as
208:44 - far as it can go the opposite direction
208:46 - if you want to push something right do
208:48 - margin f o you're going to push
208:49 - something left do margin right or
208:51 - interesting
208:52 - so it's pushing it by this much until
208:55 - it's like all the way to the right
208:57 - yeah now what's stopping it what's
208:59 - stopping it from going all the way to
209:01 - here like literally touching the edge
209:03 - what's stopping that from happening
209:05 - so remember how every message has a
209:07 - padding of 20 pixels
209:09 - uh-huh oh i see that's what padding is
209:12 - kicking in
209:13 - got it and it's in every direction left
209:15 - right bottom
209:16 - top got it exactly yeah
209:19 - so that's why it has that right so now
209:21 - what we're going to say
209:23 - is we actually want to go ahead and give
209:25 - it a background color of blue so this is
209:26 - the blue i found from the tinder's
209:28 - designs
209:29 - so we go ahead and do that and remember
209:32 - look it looks horrible right now right
209:33 - so i'm gonna go ahead and do that
209:35 - padding and border radius and it will
209:38 - suddenly look
209:39 - very nice and there we go and then the
209:42 - color of the text should be white
209:44 - so we could do that and there you go
209:47 - like there we have it so we actually
209:49 - have
209:49 - the message coming through on that side
209:52 - nice
209:54 - so it automatically starts to look
209:55 - really nice you know and that's from
209:57 - very simple rules in place right now yep
210:00 - um
210:01 - so that's that pretty much done so the
210:03 - messages in that case are pretty much
210:05 - done in terms of the design now before
210:07 - we do the input
210:09 - so the input is on the bottom so we can
210:10 - see the input is like the sort of bit
210:12 - where it says
210:13 - um input field it type a message etc
210:17 - before we get to that point um what i'm
210:19 - actually going to go ahead and do is if
210:20 - we go
210:21 - back now so to the chat screen it
210:23 - doesn't actually let us click through
210:26 - right so it's not actually letting us
210:27 - click through right so
210:30 - you see it's not clicking through so we
210:32 - need to actually quickly implement that
210:34 - bit so
210:34 - let's go ahead and do that quickly so if
210:36 - we go to use a chat
210:38 - dot js so if i go to chat.js
210:41 - now what i'm going to do is i'm
210:42 - basically going to just in order to get
210:43 - this working
210:44 - all i need to do is wrap the entire row
210:47 - with
210:47 - a link oh nice link yep right there
210:51 - oh that's clean yeah and i just need to
210:55 - import link from react router dom so if
210:57 - i go up here boom
210:58 - we do that and what i'm saying is i'm
211:00 - saying link it to
211:02 - forward slash chat forward slash name oh
211:05 - nice okay so it'll be ellen yeah
211:08 - to be ellen right so in this case it
211:10 - says unexpected token because i've got
211:12 - an
211:12 - error here so if we can get rid of that
211:14 - save it
211:16 - and now if we click on ellen
211:19 - right there yeah so you see that yeah
211:22 - you see it
211:22 - and it works right look at that can the
211:26 - styling looks horrible right so
211:27 - yeah automatically so we're going to
211:28 - remove the underline text decoration
211:31 - right exactly that exactly that
211:34 - so now we're saying here what we want to
211:37 - do is i'm just going to apply a generic
211:39 - one so i'm going to say for the anchor
211:40 - so for all of them apply a text
211:43 - decoration of none
211:44 - and what this will do is this will get
211:46 - rid of the underline but the blue is
211:48 - still there
211:49 - right to get rid of the blue you need to
211:51 - do color
211:52 - inherit yeah
211:55 - and that will fix that and now you
211:59 - actually have that clickable
212:00 - functionality oh
212:01 - nice so where is it inheriting the color
212:04 - from
212:04 - oh just the okay okay got it got it like
212:06 - the whatever it was previously
212:09 - nice that is a very clean hack so now
212:11 - it's a link but
212:12 - it doesn't even look like a link got it
212:16 - yeah awesome right that's cool and we
212:18 - actually have that working
212:19 - so that's really nice and all of the
212:21 - header stuff it still works which is
212:22 - really clean
212:23 - like everything still works and it's
212:25 - really nice right
212:26 - so um like you can see we have a full
212:30 - functioning sort of app running through
212:31 - it like
212:32 - uh the messages we have the ui done on
212:34 - the messages all we need to do now is
212:35 - actually
212:36 - add the input box uh we're not gonna
212:38 - actually implement the
212:39 - the sort of the pushing the messages in
212:41 - and stuff like that
212:42 - um we can uh if we get time but what we
212:45 - can do for now is actually go ahead and
212:46 - do the input which is the last part so
212:48 - how do you send a message to ellen right
212:51 - so
212:52 - let's go ahead and have a look so now
212:54 - what we're going to do is we're going to
212:55 - actually add that input box to the
212:56 - bottom of chat screen
212:57 - so going back to the chat screen that
212:59 - thing right there hold on is it actually
213:01 - even showing so i think you might need
213:04 - to
213:05 - resize your uh yeah because i'm showing
213:07 - at the bottom
213:14 - holy crap that is difficult to catch
213:17 - that
213:19 - so what we could i got a hack there
213:23 - hey there we go so you just want to pull
213:27 - that a little bit
213:28 - lower there we go so this is what we're
213:31 - gonna be
213:32 - building right now you guys that thing
213:36 - right over here exactly
213:40 - yeah so in order to get that built guys
213:43 - i'm gonna first
213:44 - have a div so i'm going to first say div
213:47 - and then i'm going to have a
213:48 - form because i want to have like a forms
213:50 - behavior
213:52 - and then i'm going to have two things
213:54 - i'm going to have an input field
213:56 - and i'm going to have a button right so
213:58 - i'm going to input field and i'm going
213:59 - to have a button
214:02 - and the buttons it's going to say send
214:04 - right so a very basic level now
214:07 - it looks ugly but it's right here so i
214:09 - can now
214:10 - chat with ellen hey exactly so that is
214:14 - we can start to get some kind of like
214:17 - sort of like hope to that right so we
214:19 - can say like now if i'm gonna add a
214:21 - placeholder so it says
214:22 - type a message so now i should say type
214:25 - a message in there
214:26 - okay so it's just a styling now which
214:28 - needs to be fixed
214:30 - right yeah so the first thing that we do
214:32 - in this case is we add some class names
214:34 - so we can
214:35 - reach everything in our css so the first
214:37 - one i'm going to do is class name
214:38 - and we'll say equals chat screen input
214:42 - next i'm going to say down here the
214:45 - input here should be class name oops
214:48 - class name chat screen input field
214:53 - right so i'm going to add it here input
214:54 - field so this could be input container
214:56 - this could be input however you want to
214:57 - name it is completely fine
214:59 - and also here what you could do is you
215:02 - could do
215:03 - a class name uh
215:06 - input button okay so now we've had some
215:10 - the appropriate css to reach everything
215:12 - in us inside of our css
215:13 - um so now what we're going to do is i
215:16 - need to go ahead and create
215:17 - the oh no i've got the chatscreen.css
215:19 - we're going to jump into chatscreen.css
215:22 - and we're going to go ahead and grab the
215:23 - appropriate styling so
215:25 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
215:26 - actually first say that the
215:28 - i'm going to target that form i'm going
215:30 - to target that form
215:32 - so the form this one right here right so
215:35 - what we could do here
215:36 - is we could actually say i could
215:38 - actually move this
215:39 - so i could move this from this outer
215:41 - container i could actually just put it
215:43 - here so i can say this
215:44 - right i can actually maybe possibly get
215:47 - rid of this
215:47 - so we actually we just have a form
215:49 - instead
215:51 - right so now what we do is i'm going to
215:54 - target that so i'm going to save it and
215:55 - then go back
215:56 - and we're going to say now we're going
215:58 - to say
216:00 - go to chat screen input
216:03 - so that and i'm going to say display
216:06 - flex
216:07 - so it's already in a row but we want to
216:09 - display flex because there's a reason
216:11 - why we're going to display flex in a
216:12 - second
216:13 - so display flex and then what i'm going
216:15 - to say is
216:16 - padding of 5 pixels because everything's
216:18 - too bunched up right now we don't want
216:20 - it too bunched up
216:21 - so you can see it gives it a bit more
216:24 - sort of padding there
216:25 - um oh wait no have i done that right
216:28 - yeah
216:29 - position we want that to stick to the
216:31 - bottom so i'm going to say position
216:33 - fixed
216:36 - position fixed and i'm going to say
216:38 - bottom is zero so this will stick to the
216:41 - bottom guys if you do position fixed
216:42 - bottom
216:44 - right so now you see that it sticks to
216:46 - that bottom which is exactly what we
216:47 - want right
216:48 - and then i'm going to say a width is 100
216:52 - so width is 100
216:57 - and you should see okay so it width we
217:00 - said width 100
217:01 - but it doesn't actually know like what
217:03 - to do just yet right
217:05 - and it'll make sense in a second so
217:07 - border top i'm going to say
217:09 - um where we're going border top is
217:14 - border top i'm going to give it a border
217:15 - top of one pixel solid light gray
217:18 - and at this point we can't actually see
217:20 - much oh yeah we can we can see that
217:21 - light gray i added there right
217:24 - so why did i make it display flex if i'm
217:27 - not using justify content if i'm not
217:29 - using any of that
217:30 - stuff the reason why is because
217:33 - i want to use the flex one rule that we
217:36 - used earlier so i'm going to go ahead
217:38 - and i'm going to say oh yeah it's just
217:40 - going to expand the whole thing
217:43 - yep the input should take up most of the
217:45 - room so rather than doing any hard work
217:47 - here
217:48 - boom beautiful next one it works out
217:51 - everything for us right
217:53 - i'm also going to say that input field
217:55 - is too squashed right now it needs to
217:56 - have a bit more padding so i'm going to
217:58 - say 10 pixels padding
218:00 - all right and
218:03 - there we go like we already get that
218:05 - nice little paint and now we don't
218:06 - actually want to border around it so we
218:07 - say border
218:09 - none and then we do that and
218:12 - we can see look at that it's already
218:14 - getting like a super clean ui
218:17 - nice right and then the input button
218:20 - right now
218:21 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to go
218:23 - in ahead and add the following so i'm
218:24 - going to say
218:25 - for the input button
218:29 - i'm gonna go and say i wanna no border
218:31 - so border none
218:33 - i'm gonna say a margin right of 20
218:36 - pixels
218:39 - so it's not touching the side then i'm
218:42 - going to go ahead and say
218:43 - i want a background color of white
218:47 - so it blends in i want the font weight
218:49 - to be bold
218:52 - oh let's say boda so let's make it quite
218:54 - heavy and then i'm going to say the
218:56 - color and this is the
218:57 - tinder color so i'm going to say color
218:59 - should be the tinder sort of pink
219:01 - right so boom
219:05 - there you go and just like that guys we
219:08 - get a
219:08 - super beautiful looking input field
219:12 - right now hooking that up in a lot of
219:15 - the tutorials we've shown you guys how
219:16 - we actually hook those things up and
219:18 - then we sort of you can you can
219:20 - watch that and map that but what we
219:22 - could do i guess quasi
219:23 - is we can actually kind of hook this up
219:25 - and push it into the uh
219:27 - into the message i mean should we should
219:29 - we get that try and show
219:30 - how that how that works yeah like
219:33 - writing here and then
219:34 - sending a message yeah yeah sure
219:39 - yeah because i think that we could be
219:40 - able to we can get that in quite nicely
219:42 - so
219:43 - what is i'm going to create a cons so we
219:46 - need to keep track of the input
219:47 - and say set input say use state so
219:51 - this is going to keep track of what
219:52 - you're typing inside the input field
219:54 - right so this right here then what we're
219:56 - going to do is we're going to go down
219:57 - here we're going to say the input
219:58 - value is going to be equivalent to the
220:01 - input state
220:03 - so the one that we just created and then
220:05 - we're going to say on change
220:07 - i'm just going to say by the way um is
220:10 - it possible that we would be done
220:12 - in the next 15 minutes or no
220:16 - yes yeah okay okay cool all right don't
220:19 - mean to rush it though so that's fine
220:21 - so we say set input of and here we say
220:24 - set input
220:25 - e dot target dot value
220:28 - right so then now what happens is is
220:32 - every time we type in the input field
220:33 - it's going to update and then when we
220:35 - what we do is we set the button type to
220:38 - submit because it's inside a form
220:41 - but what we want to do is we do on click
220:43 - so when we click that button
220:45 - we're going to do a handle send
220:48 - function so we're going to trigger
220:50 - handle seven functions so we need to
220:51 - write that function up here so we say
220:53 - const
220:54 - handle sub handle send takes an event
220:57 - so this is an arrow function guys and
220:59 - you need to do this line you need to do
221:01 - e dot prevent default
221:02 - otherwise it's going to refresh when you
221:05 - press enter on your keyboard you don't
221:07 - want that right
221:08 - you do not want that to have so
221:10 - basically what we need to do at this
221:12 - point is
221:12 - it's very simple we just need to say set
221:16 - messages to an array
221:19 - of whatever was currently inside of
221:21 - messages
221:22 - as well as a new message with whatever
221:26 - you've typed inside of your input
221:28 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
221:29 - going to say set input and i'm basically
221:32 - going to
221:32 - block out whatever input was so i'm
221:34 - going to do this and now this magic code
221:36 - right here
221:37 - would actually if we've done it all
221:39 - correctly should allow us to so
221:41 - imagine what we refresh and stuff like
221:42 - that and then um
221:44 - we get to this point again so now if we
221:48 - type in and we say like
221:50 - uh nice
221:53 - dude try out type in whoa
221:57 - nice awesome right
222:00 - yeah that is sick how's it going guys
222:07 - whoa that is beautiful really cool right
222:11 - hold on my face is hiding it that is
222:13 - beautiful
222:15 - nice so that's clean right so that's
222:17 - just to show you guys like how simple is
222:19 - sort of like
222:20 - you can use that um you can use state
222:23 - and you can sort of implement it and
222:24 - like you
222:24 - afterwards you can reset the state by
222:26 - using set input to blank
222:28 - right so that's actually a super clean
222:30 - way of showing you guys
222:31 - and i think with that said that's
222:34 - actually
222:35 - a really nice point where we can wrap up
222:38 - at that at that
222:38 - beautiful right so like well i think
222:40 - we've actually covered most of the bases
222:42 - there
222:43 - and guys like if you thought that was
222:45 - useful please let us know in the
222:47 - comments now
222:48 - please smash the thumbs up button if you
222:49 - did find it useful like
222:51 - i mean kazi what's your thoughts on that
222:52 - so far like with that build
222:54 - man i think this was pretty freaking
222:56 - awesome like
222:57 - being able to just build this and watch
222:59 - it happen like

223:08 - amazing front end we're using
223:09 - firebase to actually connect to the date
223:13 - like this is being pulled from a
223:14 - database
223:15 - so like you are learning that stuff too
223:19 - uh yeah front end is chris
223:22 - yeah so front ends crisp we use react
223:24 - rear
223:25 - i think with the last like five minutes
223:27 - what we can actually go ahead and do
223:29 - is show them how to deploy it
223:32 - wow yeah let's do that let's actually do
