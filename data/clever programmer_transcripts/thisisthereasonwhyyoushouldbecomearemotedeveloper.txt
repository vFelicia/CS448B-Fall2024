00:14 - hey guys what's up how's it going this
00:17 - is Kazi from clever programmer calm I am
00:20 - here in beautiful San Carlos de
00:25 - Bariloche in Argentina with my
00:28 - girlfriend who's recording this right
00:30 - now and we came to travel to the most
00:33 - random place that we could and we we
00:36 - were gonna either go somewhere United
00:38 - States but then it was kind of a
00:39 - last-minute pivot and we decided to just
00:41 - go to Argentina so if you actually have
00:43 - been here drop a comment below and let
00:46 - us know what parts you like about it or
00:49 - if you know this spot that we are at
00:51 - that's a trick question for you one
00:55 - thing that I kind of want to mention in
00:56 - this video for everybody who's watching
00:58 - it who's a developer or who wants to
01:01 - become a developer is that I really
01:04 - believe that travel is a really
01:07 - important part of what it is that we do
01:10 - and especially our job which doesn't
01:14 - actually require us to be at the
01:15 - computer doing stuff or be physically
01:17 - there we can actually be anywhere in the
01:19 - world so we don't have to be in an
01:21 - office we can actually travel and go to
01:24 - places that's one of the things I like
01:26 - about it like for example I can actually
01:27 - code even though I do a lot less coding
01:30 - now because I'm a running clever
01:31 - programmer the business itself but when
01:34 - I did do it a lot and I was coding a lot
01:36 - and I was doing freelancing with Python
01:38 - then I would be in different parts of
01:40 - the world different cities and I could
01:42 - actually just code from wherever I
01:44 - wanted and get my pick get paid be able
01:48 - to travel because things are written a
01:50 - lot less expensive in other countries
01:51 - than United States the United States has
01:53 - super expensive most of the time for not
01:55 - that important of a reason
01:59 - traveling also helps you kind of broaden
02:02 - your mind and your perspective on things
02:04 - and just makes you enjoy life a lot more
02:06 - so there's one thing I could give you
02:09 - that would be something that's
02:10 - insightful free or maybe helpful is take
02:13 - the time to travel
02:14 - it seems really scary especially when
02:16 - you're trying to travel to another part
02:18 - of the world but really going there for
02:20 - a week things are cheaper things are a
02:21 - lot more fun the vibe is just a lot
02:23 - better like this is a super dope place
02:25 - they're not a lot of places like this in
02:27 - u.s. so why not come here and take
02:30 - advantage of it and in the next few days
02:32 - you'll actually see us in a really
02:34 - really amazing spots bar look is
02:36 - freaking beautiful so when we're by the
02:39 - lake or by the ocean it kind of looks
02:42 - like this if you bring this camera here
02:44 - you know if it's gonna look something
02:48 - similar to this and that's gonna be
02:50 - really really cool a really beautiful
02:51 - one we're standing here and making a
02:53 - video anyways guys that's my tip for you
02:57 - try to find time to travel this is why I
03:00 - love doing this this is why I think
03:01 - being able to program is such a helpful
03:04 - and important skill kind of for whatever
03:06 - it is that you want to do in life so if
03:07 - you want to travel and you want to be
03:09 - able to code and you wanna be able to
03:10 - get paid you definitely want to make
03:13 - travel a part of your lifestyle and you
03:16 - want to get you want to work harder on
03:18 - coding as well and become better at it
03:20 - because that's what's gonna allow you to
03:22 - actually be able to do those things with
03:23 - that said that's it for this video thank
