00:00 - hey what's up this is Kazi from clever
00:02 - programmer not calm in this video I'm
00:04 - gonna talk about how to charge premium
00:06 - prices for your services as a freelancer
00:10 - as a developer so without any further
00:13 - ado let's jump right into it
00:16 - pricing your services is a very loaded
00:19 - question so I like to go at it I'm gonna
00:23 - tackle it from a little different angle
00:25 - which if you've been following me for a
00:26 - while you're gonna be like hey I already
00:28 - know this but this is gonna be a
00:30 - reminder to you if you're new to this
00:32 - channel hopefully this is gonna provide
00:35 - you with a different perspective now as
00:37 - a developer you know I'm a programmer
00:39 - I'm a developer
00:40 - I love the bells and whistles that I can
00:43 - provide with my with my software
00:46 - features that I build into a product so
00:49 - if I'm trying to build something for a
00:50 - client it makes me really happy or when
00:53 - I was just getting started I could do
00:54 - I'm like hey I'll take on a client for
00:56 - their website I would be like hey I can
00:58 - use Python and Django here you know what
01:00 - I realize is and now I'll start this off
01:03 - with a story so you can actually get up
01:04 - get the point in the order to be able to
01:06 - charge premium pricing but one of the
01:09 - most important things you need to be
01:11 - able to understand and do is you need to
01:14 - understand that you're solving a problem
01:17 - you are less focused on your coding and
01:21 - your bells and whistles you're more
01:23 - focused on solving a problem so here's a
01:25 - story I was one of the students from our
01:29 - course profitable programmer he joined
01:31 - this course and he landed a client who
01:34 - he was trying to build websites for him
01:36 - this tuna reaches out to me and you know
01:38 - a few days later and he said I've been
01:40 - putting in a lot of work and I'm you
01:42 - know building this this girl's website
01:44 - with Python and I'm using Django and I'm
01:48 - really going all-in
01:49 - so he's like what's your best advice for
01:51 - me you know he's like I've already spent
01:52 - like 15 or 20 hours and I asked him I
01:54 - said why are you trying to coat it with
01:57 - Python and Django and he said well you
02:00 - know that's what the course taught me it
02:02 - taught me Python and Django and then it
02:04 - said like going freelance and I said
02:06 - well what does she need
02:08 - said well she needs like contact page
02:10 - and she needs an about me page and she
02:12 - needs a home page and so I said I asked
02:15 - him I said what do you need Python and
02:16 - Django for and she said you know I was
02:19 - just building the website with it so I
02:21 - said why I'm like just use Squarespace
02:25 - just use WordPress why aren't you using
02:28 - score space for WordPress and then he
02:30 - got into argument with me and he's like
02:31 - well this course was about teaching me
02:33 - Python and Django and freelancing with
02:36 - it and now you're telling me that I
02:38 - should have just used Squarespace and I
02:41 - said yeah because nobody gives a
02:43 - about my course nobody gives a
02:45 - about your skillset people hear about
02:49 - their end result so why wouldn't you
02:51 - just use a tool that's designed for the
02:56 - problem that she has it has a very
02:58 - simple solution use the platform like
03:00 - Squarespace or WordPress build her a
03:02 - website it would have taken you an hour
03:04 - or two hours or three hours instead of
03:08 - going and spending 40 hour 30 hours or
03:10 - 40 hours trying to custom build
03:13 - something on your own and you would have
03:16 - gotten paid and that would have been it
03:18 - I hope that this story kind of shows you
03:20 - that you have to focus on the actual
03:23 - problem that you're dealing with
03:25 - sometimes it might not even rely on a
03:28 - specific programming language for
03:30 - example I was speaking with Brennan done
03:32 - today I'm at craft and commerce
03:34 - marketing conference and Brennan Dunn is
03:37 - the founder of double your freelancing
03:39 - calm and he helps freelancers be able to
03:42 - charge premium prices and I was talking
03:46 - to him and he said people need to spend
03:48 - more time actually learning the business
03:49 - side of things and and keep their eyes
03:52 - open to more local businesses and then
03:54 - go there and then if this seed there's a
03:56 - flaw in somebody's process they're doing
03:58 - too many things manually and they're
04:00 - like handing off sheets to each other or
04:03 - doing something with Excel and it's
04:05 - actually like a lot of work and then
04:07 - there's a manual process and if there's
04:09 - a workflow and you can come in you can
04:11 - update it and you can use tools that
04:12 - already exist like Google sheets you can
04:15 - use zapier that already exists you
04:18 - good news then like something is
04:19 - automatically emailed when this is done
04:21 - if you don't have to build a custom
04:23 - thing just start off by coating with
04:26 - things and leveraging things that
04:28 - already exist too many developers are
04:30 - all about have to build something from
04:33 - scratch and they get this like high off
04:35 - of building something from scratch it's
04:37 - really good good job little buddy for
04:40 - your little ego but nobody cares people
04:42 - care about the end result as a business
04:44 - owner who's gonna be giving you the
04:46 - money to help them you know prepare a
04:48 - freelancing or if you're working for a
04:50 - company or whatever the case may be you
04:52 - have to understand that the person is
04:55 - investing 5,000 10,000 20,000 40,000
04:59 - 60,000 dollars in you they have to get
05:02 - their return on investment somehow there
05:05 - has to be an actual ROI on you so you
05:10 - have to be thinking in terms of what is
05:12 - the value that I'm bringing and how can
05:15 - somebody investing in me how can I solve
05:18 - their problem they can actually give
05:19 - them a higher return so for example if
05:22 - you're building somebody's website you
05:24 - are not just improving their graphics or
05:28 - giving them nicer graphics you're
05:30 - effectively helping them get a lead a
05:33 - lead as somebody who comes in and gives
05:34 - them the email or call and if they are
05:39 - telling you that out of every hundred
05:41 - people one person buys their $3,000
05:44 - thing well effectively that's like each
05:47 - person is worth $30 to them okay so each
05:50 - new lead that you're getting for them is
05:52 - worth $30 if you build a nicer website
05:54 - and you design it to get them more leads
05:57 - and they go from getting a hundred leads
06:00 - to maybe thousand leads a month you have
06:02 - effectively 10x their business which
06:06 - means they're now going to get ten times
06:08 - the revenue meaning that so we're
06:11 - getting hundred leads now that and make
06:12 - it a niche lead was $30 right you know
06:15 - out of 100 leads that would make $3,000
06:17 - well out of a thousand leads they're
06:19 - going to make three times ten because if
06:21 - 10x they're gonna make $30,000 a month
06:25 - right so you're effectively really
06:30 - helping them increase something out the
06:32 - gross that you might add with your
06:34 - little website design is not
06:35 - realistically gonna be not that insane
06:38 - but like you might take it from then
06:41 - getting hundred leads two hundred and
06:42 - fifty leads or two hundred at least and
06:43 - in even in that case you're effectively
06:46 - adding an additional three thousand
06:48 - dollars a month to their revenue and
06:50 - over the course of 12 months a year
06:53 - you're adding or roughly thirty six
06:56 - thousand dollars to their revenue and
06:58 - that's just in year one and then they
07:00 - get to reap the benefits of it in year
07:03 - two and year three right now if you are
07:08 - sharing this with a business owner and
07:10 - you're telling them exactly what you're
07:12 - going to be able to do and how you're
07:14 - gonna be able to provide them with a
07:15 - design like that that would help them
07:18 - get more leads and you can tell them my
07:20 - goal is not to get you better design is
07:22 - to help you get more leads and more
07:24 - revenue for your business now you're not
07:27 - speaking like this little nerdy
07:28 - developer you're speaking more like
07:30 - somebody who that business owner and can
07:33 - understand
07:36 - and you're not a commodity anymore so
07:39 - they're not thinking oh I'm just gonna
07:40 - outsource this to somebody in you know
07:44 - Bangladesh or Sri Lanka who's charging
07:47 - five bucks an hour because now they're
07:50 - not just they're not comparing you on
07:52 - your skill sets they're actually
07:54 - comparing you on who's bringing you more
07:55 - value the other developer is not talking
07:58 - about any value doesn't have any
08:00 - idea so now you stand out as a very
08:03 - clear choice of the right type of person
08:05 - to work with and now what you can do is
08:09 - you can charge how much higher price to
08:11 - you can charge ten grand for that same
08:13 - website somebody else might do for $300
08:16 - okay but it's tied to a result and
08:19 - you're helping your client actually get
08:21 - that result to so this rabbit hole goes
08:27 - really deep but my advice to you would
08:28 - be really start paying attention to
08:30 - business if you want to start improving
08:33 - your income understand business
08:35 - understand like build more skills in
08:38 - your life regarding business understand
08:41 - like why somebody it will pay a
08:44 - developer like do most developers even
08:46 - know that I don't think so they're just
08:48 - like oh I'm gonna work for this company
08:49 - I'm gonna make epic games or I'm gonna
08:52 - work for this company we're gonna build
08:53 - a cool software but what's the return on
08:56 - investment for each of the software
08:58 - developers how much is the company
08:59 - profiting per software developer that
09:02 - they have what are they profiting for
09:05 - why are people hiring a freelancer to
09:07 - build them an app like for example
09:08 - somebody who has no prototype and is
09:11 - building an app they don't have a
09:14 - business model around it of course
09:17 - they're gonna pay you a hundred bucks or
09:19 - two hundred bucks and that's about it
09:20 - but then you go to somebody who's
09:22 - already making money from it and maybe
09:24 - they're making five thousand or ten
09:26 - thousand dollars a month but with your
09:27 - help now you can help them make thirteen
09:29 - thousand or fifteen thousand dollars a
09:31 - month you're moving the needle for them
09:33 - right and so then you can charge a much
09:35 - more premium price so understand more of
09:38 - the business side of things I love
09:40 - Brandon Dunn's advice like go to local
09:42 - business meetups like you can go to
09:44 - meetup.com and find them
09:45 - but really get in there with how you
09:48 - think understand you are a business my
09:51 - friend John Saunders book call soft
09:54 - skills is really really incredible on
09:56 - this as well but that's what I'm gonna
09:58 - leave you with I hope this was helpful
