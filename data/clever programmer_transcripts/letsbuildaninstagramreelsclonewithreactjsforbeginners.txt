00:03 - guys
00:04 - extremely excited for today and yeah
00:06 - hope you guys look
00:07 - too guys today we are going to be
00:11 - building the instagram reels
00:14 - clone now this is a brand new
00:16 - functionality which a lot of you guys
00:18 - currently might not know about even that
00:21 - it even exists
00:22 - but this is something that instagram put
00:24 - together
00:25 - to essentially take over tick tock
00:28 - because they didn't want to be
00:29 - taken over by it and this functionality
00:31 - is live
00:32 - now i'm showing you from my desktop
00:34 - device you actually won't be able to see
00:36 - how it is on your phone but if you
00:38 - go on your phone and you click on the
00:41 - search icon and you go to the instagram
00:43 - it'll show you reels
00:44 - so here's an example of what a reels
00:47 - looks like on instagram and then it
00:48 - keeps playing it's essentially like a
00:50 - tick tock
00:50 - so i'll just play this over here for you
00:52 - guys and check it out
01:00 - so that's an example of an instagram
01:03 - reel and this is live i have a few reels
01:06 - on my
01:07 - uh on my instagram feed already sunny
01:09 - has some
01:10 - instagram reels as well and what we
01:13 - decided to do
01:14 - is take that and then turn it into our
01:17 - own app sonny
01:19 - exactly guys like we can see over here
01:21 - we've got an app
01:22 - very very similar to what we did with
01:24 - the tick tock build
01:25 - but a lot of you guys know tik tok now
01:27 - banned in india so
01:28 - we want to go with the trend we want to
01:30 - go with what's popping now and that's
01:32 - instagram real so we went ahead listen
01:34 - to you guys and we built
01:35 - a clone of it like because you know how
01:37 - we got you know how we do it we pretty
01:38 - much we want to build these clones for
01:39 - you guys
01:40 - so if you guys are excited about this
01:42 - build let us know
01:43 - and i think we should break it down cozy
01:45 - and talk about what we're actually going
01:46 - to be including inside of this build
01:48 - we definitely will break this down and
01:51 - i'm going to show them the actual demo
01:53 - of this
01:53 - right now so i'm going to click on this
01:55 - one check it out guys this is a reels
01:57 - that
01:57 - sunny put on his own page on instagram
02:01 - and
02:01 - he put it in his clone as
02:07 - the well coming through on there what's
02:09 - up yeah it's so sick
02:11 - they can hear the sound and then this is
02:14 - another one
02:15 - let's see
02:17 - [Music]
02:20 - the editing
02:26 - even trying to get the text to pop up at
02:28 - the right times you've gotta really
02:29 - fiddle with that you know it takes a lot
02:31 - of time
02:32 - yeah yeah so you guys can see it has
02:35 - that like nice little snap functionality
02:37 - here as well
02:38 - so i will start to do now is list out
02:40 - everything that was used
02:42 - to build this clone so go ahead sunny
02:45 - and start talking to me and i'll start
02:47 - listing it out
02:49 - okay so firstly guys you guys know that
02:52 - we
02:52 - love react so this app was built using
02:55 - react
02:56 - it was give me one second here let's uh
02:59 - go again
02:59 - okay cool so this app was built in react
03:03 - we are deploying it and hosting
03:06 - it using firebase so we're going to show
03:09 - you guys how you can go ahead and do
03:11 - that
03:11 - and with a lot of our builds we wanted
03:14 - to show you guys a bit more
03:15 - functionality so what we went ahead with
03:17 - this and done with this build
03:18 - is we're actually pulling the videos
03:19 - that you see right now
03:21 - from firebase firestore so it's a
03:24 - real-time database
03:25 - right so we're actually pulling in that
03:26 - information uh inside the
03:29 - the firebase real-time database and
03:30 - we're pulling that in and we're going to
03:32 - show you guys
03:32 - how to go ahead and do that on top of
03:34 - that we have a bunch of css tricks so we
03:37 - have a bunch of css hacks that we're
03:39 - going to show you guys today
03:40 - like how did we get that snapping you
03:42 - know like how do you get that to work
03:44 - we're going to show you guys how to go
03:45 - ahead and undo that um
03:47 - we're also going to show you guys how
03:49 - you can implement um a really
03:51 - clean looking design using material ui
03:54 - so again we use material material ui in
03:57 - a lot of our builds
03:58 - and we're going to go ahead and use it
04:00 - in this build as well so we've got that
04:02 - coming
04:02 - also guys a little treat right so today
04:05 - we've actually included
04:07 - some third parties uh third-party
04:09 - libraries
04:10 - so we're using one called react ticker
04:12 - to get that little cool sort of music
04:14 - ticker at the bottom of the screen um so
04:16 - that's going to be really cool we're
04:17 - going to show you guys how you can use
04:18 - that and it's just a really really like
04:20 - this is going to be a fun build today
04:21 - guys so this is going to be one of those
04:23 - fun projects that are going to look
04:24 - really nice
04:25 - to your portfolio to add to your
04:27 - portfolio and yeah i think i'm pretty
04:29 - excited for this one
04:30 - damn this one is really meaty it's
04:32 - filled with
04:33 - tons and tons of valuable content for
04:35 - everybody i think whether you want to do
04:37 - front end or back end
04:39 - they're going to learn all of those and
04:41 - firebase and reactors just one of those
04:42 - that we keep using and we love
04:44 - so very much exactly i think that's
04:47 - going to be good
04:49 - anything else that we should add in here
04:52 - um
04:53 - we i don't think so guys we are going to
04:56 - be showing you guys if you're new to
04:58 - react
04:58 - we are going to be building this all
05:00 - with react hooks um
05:02 - yeah so we're going to be supporting all
05:03 - of the data flow throughout the app
05:05 - right now with react hooks
05:06 - i'm going to be showing you guys the use
05:07 - state hook the user fact hook so if
05:09 - you're interested in learning about
05:10 - those stay tuned and you will find out
05:12 - how to use them inside this video
05:14 - yep let me actually write that down for
05:17 - everybody
05:18 - you'll be learning react hooks okay so
05:20 - let's leave that there
05:22 - awesome guys
05:25 - get excited this is going to be an epic
05:28 - build
05:29 - i know we have tons of people already in
05:31 - the chat
05:32 - hajira is here she's like love the vibe
05:35 - here today so much positivity love you
05:37 - all michael says how long
05:39 - uh does this gonna take guys this one is
05:42 - actually gonna be pretty quick
05:44 - so we're looking at probably an hour or
05:46 - two
05:47 - and we can actually get this up and
05:49 - running with that said let's just jump
05:51 - straight into the build
05:52 - so at this point we should start off by
05:56 - doing our npx create app yeah i imagine
06:00 - exactly yeah so let's go ahead and share
06:02 - a terminal so we can work together if i
06:04 - go ahead and type live
06:06 - share and we will i'll give you
06:09 - read and write access so you should be
06:11 - good to go now
06:13 - so now if i do ls can i do ls one sec
06:16 - you should be able to there we go nice
06:20 - okay so let's just do npx create
06:23 - uh react oh you gotta have the dashes
06:26 - between act
06:28 - and what cause he's doing here guys is
06:30 - he's using a toolbook by facebook called
06:31 - create react app
06:33 - and he's using a very handy tool called
06:35 - mpx to actually go ahead and execute
06:37 - that tool that they've built
06:38 - so we've got the mpx create react app
06:40 - and then the name of the app to actually
06:42 - go ahead and set up a startup
06:43 - a project and you don't need
06:46 - cleverprogrammer.js that's just a dummy
06:48 - file i leave up but you don't need that
06:51 - yeah this is just to show you guys that
06:53 - everything is real time so you see i'm
06:54 - actually typing on the screen
06:55 - and you can see it actually pops in and
06:57 - you can see like
06:59 - as i type it comes in awesome yep
07:03 - so while this is installing guys we're
07:05 - actually gonna go ahead
07:06 - and also set up firebase
07:10 - let's do that now guys
07:14 - all you need in order to get firebase up
07:16 - and running is a
07:17 - google account so all you need is a
07:18 - gmail account and if you guys haven't
07:20 - heard of firebase
07:21 - all it is is a suite of tools that
07:23 - allows you to do
07:24 - all it is it's actually a super powerful
07:26 - suite of tools that allows you to do
07:28 - your hosting your database your
07:29 - authentication
07:30 - today we're going to be showing you guys
07:31 - how to do the authenti the
07:33 - database side of things and hosting so
07:35 - once you're signed in
07:37 - you want to click on the create project
07:38 - and then uh because he's going to run
07:40 - you through now
07:41 - how you go ahead and set up your first
07:43 - project and guys this is my new setup
07:46 - actually we just moved into this new
07:49 - place this is the team cp mansion so
07:51 - this is actually going to be the new
07:53 - setup from now on so that's one of the
07:55 - reasons why
07:56 - we ran a little bit late because we were
07:58 - trying to get this to
07:59 - be up and running and work exactly
08:02 - all right so i'm just going to hit that
08:04 - trying guys that's pretty exciting the
08:06 - new thing like i i'm super pumped to see
08:08 - that has a new backdrop

08:48 - to say if you guys are enjoying this and
08:50 - you want this to go out to as
08:52 - many people as possible what can they do
08:55 - sunny
08:57 - all you guys need to do is go ahead and
08:59 - smash the thumbs up button
09:01 - and that will help this video go out to
09:03 - as many people as possible so that's all
09:05 - we ask you guys to do
09:06 - smash that thumbs up man yeah guys go
09:08 - ahead and do it you know
09:10 - right now we're asking really nicely
09:13 - because the coffee hasn't hit
09:14 - yet but you know how it goes
09:18 - when the coffee hits hey sunny bunny
09:20 - coming in hot
09:21 - always and uh sunny bunny basically says
09:25 - um you are amazing i mean i'll actually
09:28 - show you guys because
09:30 - ecamm sometimes like messes up but this
09:32 - is
09:34 - actually what he sent us he didn't
09:37 - actually say you are a dancing pair
09:41 - all right so firebase is now set up and
09:43 - the app is started
09:45 - so now we're gonna just cd into the ig
09:48 - reels clone
09:49 - and i'm going to hit npm start to get it
09:52 - up and running
09:53 - now while that happens i'm going to go
09:56 - inside of this folder here
09:58 - i don't need this clever programmer js
10:00 - i'm just going to delete it
10:01 - now inside here in the source a few
10:04 - files that we don't need
10:06 - so let's just clean up a little bit this
10:08 - one this one and this one these three
10:10 - here
10:11 - so we're gonna hit delete now it's gonna
10:14 - error out and say hey you're missing a
10:17 - logo
10:18 - if you zoom in that's what it's actually
10:20 - saying you're missing a logo that's a
10:21 - simple fix
10:22 - it's because we deleted the logo so
10:24 - we're going to go into
10:25 - our app.js delete this line here
10:29 - and that's one thing and then delete
10:32 - everything that's actually
10:34 - inside of this header or in this inside
10:37 - of this div
10:38 - i'm going to delete it and i'm just
10:40 - going to create a simple
10:42 - h1 tag like that
10:45 - and this is going to say hey clever
10:47 - programmer
10:48 - let's build an ig reels
10:52 - clone nice all right
10:55 - and i'm going to hit save
10:58 - and it should be good to go so you guys
11:01 - can see that it is already
11:03 - up and running here so that's dope now
11:06 - what we want to do is we want to make
11:07 - sure
11:08 - some of the styling is gone so here we
11:11 - see a few things happening
11:12 - so one thing that we see here is
11:16 - it's centering it right and then the
11:19 - other thing that's happening is that
11:20 - there is this
11:22 - margin over here at the top that's kind
11:24 - of added by default
11:25 - so we're going to go ahead and remove
11:27 - all of those things right now so
11:30 - we're gonna go inside of app.css
11:35 - and i'm gonna highlight everything and
11:36 - delete it and i'm gonna hit save
11:39 - now what you'll see happen is now it's
11:41 - left aligned so that should happen for
11:43 - you as well
11:44 - the second thing we're gonna do is we're
11:46 - going to go into our index.css
11:49 - so make sure you're not in app.css
11:51 - anymore go here
11:53 - and inside of here we're going to remove
11:56 - that annoying invisible margin that
11:58 - exists
11:59 - so we're going to go here select
12:00 - everything i'm just going to go margin
12:02 - zero
12:04 - and now you see what happens right that
12:07 - match in magical weird margin is now
12:10 - gone if i remove it
12:13 - it's back so no need for that let's just
12:16 - clean it up
12:17 - boom so we are pretty much
12:20 - ready to go one last thing we do want to
12:23 - mention
12:24 - is we are using bem
12:27 - naming convention and
12:30 - right and for that we want to make sure
12:33 - our class name is actually app
12:35 - like this lowercase uh with that said
12:39 - sunny go ahead
12:41 - dude i'm so proud you can't do that
12:44 - i literally just say i'm like yes you
12:46 - have tears coming out of your eyes
12:49 - i also want to say a massive thank you
12:51 - to uh
12:54 - ready who just dropped a donation and
12:56 - said good job
12:57 - thank you very much so much appreciate
12:59 - you awesome
13:01 - nice thank you guys so as kazzy said
13:04 - let's go ahead and get started guys
13:06 - so now what we want to do is we are
13:08 - going to actually go ahead and sort of
13:10 - map out the app first right
13:12 - so this app has a very sort of basic
13:15 - layout in inside of app.js right we
13:17 - actually had
13:18 - that logo at the top and then they said
13:20 - rules and then we had the videos
13:22 - and the videos is kind of like a
13:23 - container which just has a scrollable
13:25 - section of videos right so let's go
13:27 - ahead and sort of mark it out right so
13:29 - the first thing we're going to have
13:30 - is a div which says app underscore
13:33 - underscore top
13:34 - right so let's actually visually share
13:37 - what you're talking about so go ahead
13:39 - what were you saying
13:41 - yeah no i was going to say oh damn it my
13:42 - emmett doesn't work but that's fine
13:44 - that's completely fine
13:45 - um yeah so guys yeah so what we're going
13:47 - to first do is we have the image at the
13:49 - top right so image
13:50 - at top the real zebra yeah yep so that's
13:53 - the logo and then we have the text which
13:55 - says rails
13:57 - right so we have that and then we have
14:00 - the text which says reals
14:02 - and then we have a little bit of space
14:04 - and then we have like a container
14:07 - of app videos so pretty much the reason
14:09 - why i'm doing it like that is because
14:10 - we're going to be calling it the
14:12 - the app videos container so this is just
14:14 - pretty much a
14:15 - scrollable container okay this is a
14:18 - scrollable
14:19 - oops container like that right
14:23 - so it's pretty much just a scrollable
14:24 - container and then everything is going
14:26 - to happen inside of that container
14:28 - right so it's very very simple we're
14:29 - gonna have one div up here and then
14:31 - we're gonna have one
14:32 - div over here right and then all the
14:34 - magic is gonna happen there
14:35 - um awesome so
14:39 - with that said what we're gonna do now
14:41 - is
14:42 - first make the first dip so you see
14:44 - we've actually sectioned things off so i
14:45 - recommend you do this
14:47 - in order to actually make it a little
14:48 - bit easier for yourselves in terms of
14:50 - laying things out so here
14:51 - we can do div app top please work please
14:54 - work please work
14:55 - no it didn't work okay never mind so
14:58 - i've got to do it the old school way
14:59 - i'll say div
15:01 - there we go last name equals
15:05 - uh and then i'm going to say app
15:06 - underscore top there we go
15:09 - so this one's going to be div on the
15:10 - squad up top and then that's pretty much
15:12 - going to have the top of the
15:14 - uh so the logo and the text and then
15:16 - we're going to have that scrollable
15:18 - container right so we're going to say
15:19 - div
15:21 - and then i'm going to say class name of
15:24 - app videos like this right and then
15:28 - inside of here we're going to pretty
15:29 - much have
15:30 - that one so you see when you just mark
15:32 - it out it makes life a lot easier
15:33 - right it does make it a lot simpler to
15:35 - just kind of visualize what's going to
15:37 - happen
15:38 - so let's go ahead and actually pop
15:40 - things in straight away so we can
15:42 - actually see that logo at the top
15:43 - yeah what i like about how sunny marks
15:46 - and these comments is he's thinking in a
15:48 - component-based way so even when we just
15:50 - drew it out
15:51 - earlier like this right this is kind of
15:54 - like a component-based way of thinking
15:56 - and pretty much these comments will tell
15:59 - you what you need to do later on so love
16:01 - that
16:02 - exactly and like when you're using react
16:05 - guides you really want to
16:06 - shift your mindset into it that
16:07 - component based way of thinking
16:09 - it will make things a lot easier and a
16:11 - lot of simpler to sort of build things
16:13 - also massive thank you to surab who just
16:15 - dropped a donation
16:16 - appreciated so he goes i am new to
16:20 - c-sharp development
16:21 - any guidance this is all react at the
16:23 - moment dude um
16:25 - but i mean if we get enough interest
16:26 - then we can sort of look into that stuff
16:29 - awesome so now we've got uh let's just
16:32 - go ahead and save
16:33 - so what we're gonna do is we are going
16:35 - to actually go ahead and first add the
16:37 - first image so i've got an image here um
16:40 - it's literally just the instagram logo
16:43 - guys so
16:44 - uh we will share the code afterwards for
16:46 - you guys so you guys can see this
16:47 - but this is just a logo i got off of um
16:51 - off of google images and it's just the
16:53 - logo i'll do this for the first one
16:54 - because i guess
16:55 - everyone can sort of just copy that but
16:57 - after that guys i'm not going to show
16:58 - you all the links because it's going to
17:00 - be very simple for you guys to go ahead
17:01 - and grab these yourself
17:03 - um nice so as soon as i click save on
17:05 - that notice i gave it a name of app logo
17:07 - so we can style it afterwards
17:09 - and let's go ahead and open up our
17:10 - localhost fuzzy
17:12 - yup let's go ahead and do that
17:18 - right over here awesome
17:23 - nice so you see we have a massive
17:25 - instagram logo right now
17:26 - so let's go ahead and first let's fix
17:28 - that because right now we can't really
17:29 - work with anything when we have that
17:31 - massive logo
17:32 - spamming the entire screen so i'm going
17:35 - to go into my css
17:36 - and i'm going to target i'm going to say
17:37 - go and target the app logo
17:39 - and give it a height and i'm going to
17:41 - use like a sort of dynamic value i'm
17:43 - going to say 12
17:44 - view height which means 12 of the height
17:46 - of the screen give it that height
17:47 - so as soon as i go ahead and do that we
17:49 - should see it drop
17:50 - to a drastically smaller size uh so let
17:53 - me go ahead and save
17:55 - uh it's not letting me save carzi so
17:57 - maybe you might need to save on your
17:59 - local
18:02 - there we go nice awesome
18:05 - so if you uh maybe i think you if you
18:08 - follow me
18:09 - might be easier i am following you
18:14 - oh you are yeah yeah
18:17 - is it following me because i'm in app.js
18:19 - right now it just moved there it's just
18:21 - lagging for some reason i don't know why
18:23 - even though my computer
18:24 - is not lagging but i don't know why
18:26 - visual studio code
18:28 - is lagging don't know where is that so
18:31 - now
18:31 - for the text that we're going to do is
18:32 - we're just going to have a simple h1
18:34 - because it's it's going to be a
18:36 - uh main header so we're going to use h1
18:38 - for it we're going to say rows
18:39 - simple as that and then go ahead and
18:41 - click save i don't know why
18:43 - uh vs goes not let me save should i try
18:46 - and rejoin the session
18:48 - yeah you can try to yeah you can try to
18:50 - leave and rejoin yeah give that a give
18:52 - that a shot
18:52 - let me go let me give that a try because
18:54 - then do you need a different link or
18:56 - you're going to be fine with that link
18:58 - i should be able to jump on the same
19:00 - link yep
19:02 - you guys can prepare javascript
19:03 - interviews awesome you guys
19:05 - so make sure you guys keep asking your
19:07 - questions and whatever things you have
19:09 - in your mind
19:10 - in the chat below because we are looking
19:12 - at all of those
19:14 - and we can take all of your questions
19:16 - and answer them
19:17 - through the live stream if it makes
19:19 - sense to or will hold it for the end and
19:21 - then answer them then
19:25 - and i'm responding to a lot of people
19:26 - actually through just chat
19:30 - nice i am back
19:34 - okay i think if i click save now i think
19:38 - it should work okay so you can see me
19:41 - right inside yeah i'm following you nice
19:45 - okay so awesome so now i can save as
19:46 - well i think um so now
19:48 - we've got the rails there so that's
19:49 - what's good and then what we're going to
19:51 - do is just go
19:52 - ahead and we've got the app videos and
19:53 - basically what i'm going to do is i'm
19:54 - going to mark out something here guys
19:56 - so what we're going to eventually have
19:58 - is basically a bunch of video components
20:00 - right so it's just going to be a bunch
20:02 - of videos and what the way that we're
20:04 - going to basically render it so this
20:06 - the this styling for this app videos
20:08 - will make these videos appear
20:10 - in the scrollable way that you guys saw
20:13 - previously okay
20:14 - so that's going to be sort of our end
20:16 - goal of where we want to get to
20:17 - and we can actually go ahead and style a
20:19 - lot of this now so we'll go ahead and do
20:21 - that so let's go over to app.css
20:24 - so first i'm just going to hit save on
20:25 - this aditya just dropped a donation he
20:28 - says
20:29 - just love the amount of good things you
20:31 - are doing for the developer community
20:32 - keep going
20:33 - we appreciate that thank you very much
20:35 - dude
20:36 - thank you amazing thanks olivia
20:39 - yeah amazing um so now inside of
20:42 - the app.css what we're going to do at
20:44 - the top of the file we're going to type
20:46 - in
20:47 - so this is actually a requirement for
20:50 - getting that
20:50 - snapping functionality right so in order
20:53 - to get that scrolling snapping
20:54 - functionality
20:55 - you have to type in html at the top
20:58 - and then you have to drop the following
21:00 - line so it's scroll snap type
21:02 - y mandatory now this is saying set a
21:06 - scrolling snap type for the y axis which
21:08 - is the sort of scrolling up and down
21:10 - and we're going to make it mandatory and
21:12 - just to be clear the scrolling
21:14 - functionality that sunny is referring to
21:16 - guys
21:17 - is this one over here when i like
21:20 - notice how if i just scroll and i let go
21:23 - watch how it snaps right boom and it
21:27 - snaps
21:28 - that's what you want that's what tick
21:29 - tock and ig reels both have
21:33 - exactly without that you're going to get
21:35 - a clunky horrible experience where it's
21:37 - just going to be like
21:38 - a normal web page which it completely
21:40 - breaks the user experience so you want
21:41 - to have that snapping
21:43 - right now what we're going to do next is
21:45 - we're going to target the app container
21:47 - we're going to say this is a really neat
21:48 - trick if you guys didn't know it
21:50 - but we're going to say display grid
21:52 - right so display grid
21:53 - and then we say place items oops place
21:58 - items center like this
22:01 - and what this will do is i love this
22:03 - trick so oh because
22:04 - if you head back to the local host
22:08 - yup yup and then now if i hit
22:12 - save for some reason it's not let me say
22:14 - you might have to save on the files i
22:16 - think cozy
22:17 - yeah there's not let me yeah nice so you
22:20 - see guys what it did is
22:21 - it actually went ahead and centered the
22:23 - elements right but it does it on the x
22:25 - and y
22:26 - axis if you believe it or not and then
22:28 - in order to get it perfectly centered
22:29 - what i need to do is say height
22:31 - of 100 of view height right so if i go
22:34 - ahead and do that and then we save it
22:36 - so now if we do that it will actually
22:38 - center with a hundred percent of the
22:41 - the height of the screen right so if we
22:44 - save
22:44 - that one then we should see it pop into
22:46 - this there we go so that's actually it
22:48 - may not look it
22:49 - but right now all of the contents are
22:51 - being centered perfectly in the middle
22:52 - of the screen
22:53 - yeah because before without using that
22:56 - grid technique it
22:57 - sometimes centers it like this way and
22:59 - like it'll put it over here
23:02 - but yeah with grid it actually like
23:05 - centers it both
23:07 - vertically and actually like
23:09 - horizontally so it gets perfect metal
23:12 - exactly just with two lines of code uh
23:15 - display grid and place item center so
23:17 - that's really really powerful
23:18 - uh stuff right there so we're gonna
23:20 - click uh going to go ahead and add a
23:22 - background color of so for now what i'm
23:25 - going to do is i'm going to add a
23:26 - background color of black
23:28 - but for now i'm going to comment it out
23:29 - because if i do that you're not going to
23:31 - see the text
23:32 - right so i'm not going to add that in
23:33 - just yet but i'm going to add it and
23:34 - then comment out
23:35 - and then what i'm gonna do is for the um
23:38 - the
23:38 - text inside of the top section so
23:41 - remember we had app
23:42 - top i'm gonna target the h1 and say
23:44 - align the text in the center
23:46 - and make the color of the text white
23:48 - okay and then i'm going to do
23:50 - that and then i'm also going to say um
23:53 - that's yes go ahead and do that so this
23:54 - firstly let's go ahead and
23:56 - make this background color black and
23:57 - let's go ahead and save the file
24:01 - so because you need to save app.css oh
24:04 - okay
24:07 - nice now you can see that it's pretty
24:09 - much gone ahead and it's made everything
24:11 - black but it didn't do what we wanted
24:13 - and changed the
24:14 - app.js h1 so it should have made this
24:18 - actually oh sonny should we should we
24:20 - just enable
24:21 - word wrap like because we do this really
24:23 - often
24:25 - yeah shall we because i think a lot of
24:27 - that will help a lot of people actually
24:28 - yeah
24:29 - um okay so on so let's go back
24:33 - there so it i think word wrap is gonna
24:36 - be super because that's been i think a
24:37 - really frustrating thing even when i'm
24:39 - watching our own streams i get confused
24:42 - where
24:42 - everything is yeah so that should be is
24:45 - there auto is there auto save or
24:47 - something along those lines we can
24:48 - enable in visual studio code
24:51 - oh good shot actually good shot uh let's
24:53 - go ahead and click
24:54 - settings let me double check let's do
24:56 - auto save
25:02 - yeah so on focus change a day edit is
25:06 - automatically saved when the editor
25:07 - loses focus or
25:09 - we can do after a delay oh it's a dirty
25:12 - editor what the hell is a dirty editor
25:14 - i think that's when i switch to a
25:16 - different file it will save
25:18 - actually that's a good way of doing it
25:20 - yeah on focus change maybe but i mean
25:22 - you want
25:22 - it should be delay right or because
25:25 - no on it should be or which one should
25:28 - it be
25:29 - let's do after delay because then that
25:31 - way they can see the screen as it
25:32 - changes yeah let's do after today what
25:34 - are you up to today i think
25:35 - perfect perfect so that might be one
25:39 - second
25:39 - yeah so if i one second delay that's
25:42 - pretty good so like
25:43 - let me test it so it says
25:46 - um okay reels
25:53 - nice that's perfect dude let's actually
25:56 - remove
25:56 - that i'll do it now i'll do
25:59 - i'll remove the delay to half a second
26:01 - actually
26:02 - dude that's pretty good actually try it
26:05 - that's like that's like real time coding
26:07 - i guess that's like
26:08 - real time yeah so let's do it yeah two
26:13 - i'm gonna do it 300 seconds yeah the
26:15 - only thing i'm wondering is
26:17 - say if i'm coding like a bunch like this
26:19 - oh
26:20 - that could be annoying oh no then again
26:22 - it's not doing it
26:23 - it's not doing it that's okay yeah we're
26:26 - good we're good
26:28 - okay he does it in a clever way should i
26:30 - do it should i do it half second or less
26:32 - than half a second
26:34 - uh let's do it
26:38 - let's just give it let's give it a half
26:40 - second this year let's see how half
26:41 - second goes
26:42 - okay cool done yeah that's pretty cool
26:46 - nice so that should help you guys out a
26:47 - bit more so you it should be a
26:49 - easier sort of smoother visual cue on
26:51 - you guys
26:52 - so now if we go back to this and we save
26:54 - oh no i don't need to save
26:55 - um so now
27:00 - it's not a localhost 3000 why are we not
27:02 - seeing
27:03 - that's what i'm getting confused about
27:04 - what the hell is going on
27:06 - so if we refresh three uh refresh the
27:09 - whiteboard i'll refresh i
27:10 - okay there we go okay
27:13 - now we're back nice awesome
27:17 - hey that's pretty cool man nice
27:21 - there it's going to make us super lazy
27:26 - so now let's go ahead go ahead and get
27:27 - rid of the top hey hello cover
27:29 - programmers
27:30 - section and now if we do that we've got
27:32 - rails in the middle right
27:34 - so what i'm going to do now is i'm
27:36 - actually going to go ahead and style the
27:37 - app videos
27:39 - so that it looks like a sort of outline
27:42 - for what we want to do so let's go ahead
27:43 - and do app does it so rules
27:45 - app videos is what's going to hold all
27:46 - the videos right so we're going to go
27:48 - ahead and do app
27:52 - videos like this and i'm going to go
27:54 - ahead and do
27:55 - position relative because i want the
27:58 - contents of
27:59 - whatever's inside of it to be relative
28:00 - and then we'll do height of
28:02 - oops so i'm going to do height of
28:06 - 65 px 65 view at the view height so
28:09 - height
28:10 - of 65
28:13 - view height like this and then i'm going
28:17 - to go and do oh dude this is insane this
28:18 - is live saving
28:20 - i like that yeah and then we're going to
28:22 - do background color of white
28:23 - so background color of white
28:27 - like this
28:31 - all right and then what we're going to
28:33 - do is
28:36 - and then we're going to go to make a
28:38 - border radius
28:39 - of 20 pixels right so i'm going to do
28:41 - first i'm going to do a width of 70
28:43 - pixels because right now you guys can't
28:44 - actually see anything
28:46 - so let's go ahead and do that and then
28:47 - you can see now we've got the outline
28:49 - oh dude are you if you go to app.css i
28:51 - don't think they can see the screen
28:53 - um
28:57 - there we go yeah so guys i was just
28:59 - adding in
29:01 - yeah perfect nice yeah so now what we
29:04 - did was these four lines of code
29:06 - so we've added a background color a
29:07 - width of 70. whoa
29:11 - just said hi guys is it bad to use let
29:14 - me actually
29:14 - let me actually show this first so let
29:16 - me pop it up
29:18 - boom there we go all right go for it
29:20 - thank you by the way for the five
29:21 - pound donation that is massive thank you
29:25 - so much damn
29:27 - yeah it's crazy he's got it started up
29:29 - nice so he goes
29:30 - hi guys is it better to use class
29:32 - components or functional components
29:33 - or hooks and where are you guys from usa
29:36 - and nice videos
29:36 - so firstly conversational components
29:40 - yeah what's that
29:43 - i was i just screamed functional
29:45 - components
29:49 - can you hear me really yeah yeah yeah
29:52 - okay yeah yeah yeah kind of going a bit
29:54 - weird yeah so um
29:56 - we have so it's functional components
29:58 - guys
29:59 - right so you only use function commas
30:01 - class components have been around for a
30:03 - longer time
30:04 - so you're gonna you're gonna need to
30:05 - know them but functional components are
30:07 - like the creme de la creme they're
30:08 - really
30:09 - beautiful nice components which were
30:11 - introduced afterwards for the reasons
30:13 - of which we didn't like using
30:15 - class-based components okay
30:17 - now hooks whenever we talk about hooks
30:20 - we're always
30:21 - talking about functional components you
30:23 - can't use
30:24 - hooks inside of class-based components
30:26 - something that everyone needs to know
30:28 - right now oh and we've got five pound
30:30 - donation as well just now
30:34 - damn what is going on thank you by the
30:38 - way and hopefully that answers your
30:40 - question and i'm in la
30:41 - and i think sunny is somewhere else and
30:43 - marley just gave
30:44 - another donation let me actually yeah i
30:48 - scared sunny or something that's funny
30:50 - froze up he's like what uh marley thank
30:53 - you for the five dollar donation that is
30:55 - huge
30:56 - and marley says uh twenty dollars
30:58 - apparently please create a profile user
31:00 - for this project so that's something we
31:02 - could extend it to eventually and maybe
31:04 - even add to the course
31:06 - we just might not have time to do it on
31:07 - this live stream right here
31:09 - but thank you so much marley thank you
31:12 - dude that
31:13 - means a lot yeah nice awesome
31:17 - um now what we are going to do is
31:21 - um we are actually going to carry on
31:23 - with the app video so that little square
31:25 - box right
31:26 - so we want that to uh so i'm going to go
31:29 - ahead and do a border radius of 20
31:31 - pixels
31:32 - so a width of 70 border radius of 20
31:34 - pixels
31:35 - so if i go ahead and save that now you
31:36 - can see it gives a nice uh outline
31:38 - of the box right and then i'm going to
31:40 - go ahead and do a max width and a max
31:42 - height so that way
31:43 - if we stretch the screen too much it
31:45 - doesn't kind of grow uncontrollably
31:47 - right
31:47 - now this is where the important stuff
31:49 - happens right so in order to make that
31:52 - uh container scrollable what i need to
31:55 - do is i need to add overflow scroll
31:57 - so if we ever add some content inside of
31:59 - it it's going to be
32:00 - a scrollable container and then i want
32:02 - to do scroll
32:03 - snap type y mandatory so this is the
32:06 - same line of code that we added at the
32:08 - top over here
32:09 - but i'm going to go ahead and add it at
32:10 - the bottom here now this is going to
32:12 - this is like the magic piece to getting
32:14 - that scrolling functionality
32:16 - this scroll snap type but you need to
32:17 - add it here and you do need to add it
32:19 - here there's two places where you need
32:20 - to add it that's it
32:22 - two places and that's gonna allow us to
32:24 - do what we wanna do
32:25 - right and i will show you guys how we'll
32:26 - get that working fully afterwards but
32:28 - notice how when we scrolled through the
32:30 - app we didn't have
32:32 - oh nice marley mouse says i tried the 20
32:36 - but it didn't let me my bad he just
32:37 - donated another five dollars
32:39 - thank you dude oh damn
32:44 - jesus christ dude we're already at like
32:48 - what we have over 500 concurrent viewers
32:51 - and we're at
32:51 - 27 in donation thank you so much and
32:54 - marley just dropped
32:56 - he and he said and he says uh i tried
32:58 - the 20
32:59 - but they didn't let me my bad with
33:01 - another five dollar donation thank you
33:02 - so much
33:03 - guys if you're enjoying this by the way
33:05 - make sure you smash that like button so
33:08 - this video can go out
33:09 - and help a lot more people on this
33:11 - planet
33:12 - and all you have to do to do that is hit
33:15 - that one button
33:16 - and then that's it exactly guys
33:19 - all you need to do if you're enjoying
33:21 - this content you want us to keep giving
33:22 - it
33:22 - and keep bringing more value then go
33:24 - ahead and smash the thumbs up before
33:26 - button for us
33:27 - that's all we ask nice so can you notice
33:30 - how on the screen right now
33:32 - it's got the nice border on the left and
33:34 - then it's actually has got it at the
33:35 - bottom but it's kind of just big of a
33:37 - too big for the screen but on the right
33:39 - hand side we've got like a slight scroll
33:41 - bar
33:42 - we don't want a scroll bar okay we don't
33:44 - want that scroll bar so i need to go
33:46 - ahead and hide that so there's a hack to
33:48 - hiding that
33:48 - and it's this right here so this was
33:50 - actually got off of google and i've used
33:52 - it plenty of times
33:53 - so i need to go ahead and do this so i
33:55 - need to add this code right here so
33:57 - the first one what we do is we target
33:59 - our videos and we say
34:00 - using the webkit scroll bar we're going
34:02 - to hide the we're going to do display
34:03 - none which will hide
34:04 - the the web scroll bar so if we do that
34:07 - it will hide it for chrome safari and
34:09 - opera so you can see now it's gone
34:10 - we also want to hide it for other
34:11 - browsers so internet explorer edge and
34:13 - firefox even though i'm not big fans of
34:15 - those
34:15 - but basically you want to go ahead and
34:16 - do dot videos and do ms overflow style
34:19 - none and you'll do scroll bar width of
34:21 - none as well and that will hide it for
34:22 - those browsers
34:23 - and with that said you pretty much get
34:24 - this nice finished effect right so that
34:27 - looks really nice
34:29 - uh and with that done i think actually
34:31 - at that point we already
34:32 - what i want to do is i want to basically
34:34 - pull the app top
34:36 - down but because we've done it as a
34:39 - grid it's actually trying to equally
34:41 - distribute the space so i'm going to go
34:43 - ahead and target up top
34:44 - and say margin bottom of what negative
34:47 - 150 pixels so that will actually
34:49 - pull it down closer to the angle so we
34:52 - can actually make that
34:54 - uh yeah that's pretty good nice there
34:56 - you go nice
34:57 - so with that said we've actually gone
34:58 - ahead and we've prepared the app right
35:00 - so we prepared the app and now what
35:02 - we're going to do is create that video
35:04 - so that video is sort of where the magic
35:05 - pops in where we sort of get everything
35:07 - working
35:08 - so in order to get that done uh qazi can
35:10 - we
35:11 - create a video.js component please yep
35:14 - so let's go i'll go over here
35:19 - click this plus button and video
35:23 - card.js right or
35:25 - yeah oh god
35:30 - okay cool there we go
35:33 - right boom so all components are
35:36 - capitalized guys and what's up
35:39 - uh let's go ahead and try and use the
35:41 - es7 snippet
35:43 - cool so we're gonna do rfce hit tab
35:46 - and damn look at that dude you know i
35:49 - just i love that every time the fact
35:51 - that it pulls a function
35:53 - function name right from the actual
35:56 - file like that is cool oh my goodness
35:59 - moline coming in hot again
36:01 - let's go oh man
36:06 - uh thank you so much moline really
36:09 - appreciate you
36:10 - and marine says i was asking where
36:11 - you're from because i might move to usa
36:13 - soon i'm from france
36:14 - i'm doing my master how hard is it to
36:16 - get a job there
36:17 - um some of these questions we're going
36:19 - to cover in more detail at the end moyne
36:21 - just so we can actually make this
36:22 - tutorial as valuable
36:24 - for as many people as possible but you
36:26 - know yes we i am located in usa
36:29 - and it's not that hard to get a job as
36:31 - long as you have the skills and i'm with
36:33 - that said we're just going to keep on
36:34 - moving
36:36 - exactly also thank you to sunil bahara
36:38 - for that donation nice
36:40 - um so now what we're gonna do is we have
36:44 - the video card
36:45 - we have the video card in place right so
36:48 - i'm gonna go ahead
36:49 - and pop the class name in so i'm gonna
36:52 - do class
36:52 - name equals video card
36:56 - up here like this and what we want to do
36:58 - is we want to get into a habit guys of
37:00 - doing an import
37:01 - and importing the corresponding video
37:03 - card.css file so like this
37:06 - right and then you want to save and then
37:08 - what we're going to do now is actually
37:09 - go ahead and create that file so i'm
37:11 - going to do video
37:12 - card dot css and we should pop into that
37:14 - file
37:16 - in a sweet second if it ever
37:19 - does it um
37:22 - did it create create a what ah there
37:26 - it is video card does yes damn that took
37:28 - forever yeah
37:31 - uh yeah so nice so now
37:34 - we are going to so now we can style this
37:36 - component right so it allows us to style
37:38 - it and get things moving
37:39 - awesome so what we can do now is
37:42 - we want to go ahead and actually add in
37:45 - the functionality here so
37:47 - what i'm going to do is for the first
37:50 - one
37:51 - let's go ahead and map out what we're
37:52 - going to have so we're going to have
37:54 - a video so we're going to have a video
37:55 - so i'm just going to do a video like
37:57 - this
37:58 - and a video tag in html takes a few
38:01 - things it takes a source
38:02 - right and the source can be like any url
38:05 - and if we don't pass the source
38:07 - it has an alt right so the oak can just
38:08 - say uh
38:10 - let's just do ig real video for now so
38:13 - that's what will show if it's if it
38:14 - doesn't have a correct sort of
38:16 - source right so let's go ahead and do
38:18 - that nice
38:20 - and then my pretty is not working so
38:22 - it's really annoying um
38:24 - awesome so now with that said we're
38:25 - going to go ahead and add
38:27 - a i'm going to go ahead and firstly
38:32 - do it so that the videos also loop so if
38:35 - you're playing a video on on instagram
38:37 - reels you notice they actually loops
38:39 - so if you write loop like this it
38:41 - actually goes ahead
38:42 - goes ahead and does this so it's like
38:44 - saying true so we can just say
38:46 - loop and that'll do it for us um and
38:48 - then
38:49 - what we want to do is we want to pass it
38:51 - a video so
38:52 - to sort of test this right we want to
38:54 - get this sort of testing oh by the way
38:55 - this is
38:56 - awesome bro so epic zoo sent a message
39:00 - and he said clever programmer
39:03 - he goes i joined profit with javascript
39:06 - pwj on monday
39:08 - you are providing way too much value in
39:10 - the course i feel overwhelmed
39:12 - it's up to a person how they make the
39:14 - most out of all the resources and pwg
39:17 - community that's amazing dude
39:20 - welcome to the team firstly yeah yeah
39:23 - yeah welcome to the team dude and i'll
39:25 - see you in a coaching call
39:27 - that's amazing guys like that he's right
39:28 - it's it's down to you
39:30 - about how much you're going to like if
39:32 - you're going to put in the work that's
39:33 - where you're going to see the results
39:34 - and we do provide a bunch of resources
39:36 - and that community
39:37 - inside of pwg yeah so that is huge
39:42 - and that's awesome right um so
39:45 - now what we're going to do is go over to
39:48 - the video so
39:49 - actually what i'm going to do is i'm
39:50 - going to pull in a dummy video for now
39:52 - so i think i have a dummy video over
39:55 - here so i'm going to go ahead and grab
39:57 - this one
39:58 - and this is this should be kazi's video
40:00 - so if i go ahead and grab this and i pop
40:02 - this in so
40:04 - if i go ahead and do source and i'm
40:05 - going to hard code this one so if i go
40:07 - ahead and pop that in
40:09 - so now if i go ahead and show this on
40:11 - the screen
40:12 - so if i go ahead and say video card so
40:14 - i'm going to use that component that we
40:15 - just done
40:16 - thank you pedro he just dropped a 5
40:18 - donation
40:19 - nice damn video card thank you so much
40:22 - pedro
40:24 - and then i need to go ahead and import
40:26 - so i say import video card
40:29 - right import video card from
40:33 - video card whoa where's that screaming
40:36 - from there you go and now that should
40:39 - show on the screen so if we go ahead and
40:41 - save that
40:43 - um it should show on the screen what is
40:46 - okay it's been a little bit delayed yeah
40:49 - so now we should see that video so you
40:51 - can see the videos there right
40:52 - now videos by default won't play so we
40:55 - don't want it to play by default which
40:56 - is correct
40:57 - but the size of that video is wrong okay
41:00 - so first i need to go ahead and style
41:02 - that so i'm going to go ahead and give
41:03 - it a class and the class name i'm going
41:04 - to give it is video player
41:06 - because that's what that's what we're
41:07 - referring to here is the video player
41:10 - i'm going to go inside of videocard.css
41:13 - and i'm going to do
41:15 - [Music]
41:16 - oh bro what is going on you guys
41:20 - what the hell damn
41:24 - noah goes noah hepburn just dropped a
41:27 - 10 donation thank you noah so much and
41:30 - he goes honestly y'all are helping me so
41:32 - much in my self-taught journey
41:34 - this is my way of saying thank you bro
41:37 - thank you this is amazing it keeps us
41:40 - going
41:41 - and we love this is why we do this every
41:44 - freaking day
41:45 - and we're trying to get to actually even
41:46 - seven times a week
41:49 - and it means the world to us and it just
41:51 - keeps us going because we want to help
41:52 - you guys
41:53 - along your journey because i wish that i
41:57 - had this when i was learning to code
41:59 - if when i was doing python and django
42:02 - if somebody was doing this i would have
42:04 - been at a whole another level
42:07 - if i could just watch somebody do python
42:09 - django builds every day
42:10 - so for somebody who's doing react or
42:13 - javascript and you get to see this
42:15 - i mean i think this is awesome for you
42:17 - and just thank you so much
42:20 - exactly when we see that guys it really
42:22 - really makes doing this every day
42:24 - so much easier it makes us like driven
42:27 - so honestly we are massively appreciate
42:28 - you know
42:29 - thank you so much for that thank you
42:32 - nice
42:33 - um so with that said we're going to go
42:36 - ahead and style
42:37 - the video card so what we did initially
42:41 - was we said
42:42 - that the the video's too big right it's
42:44 - just way too big so i'm going to go
42:45 - ahead and give the video player
42:47 - so if i go ahead and do video on sponsor
42:50 - player
42:51 - what i'm going to first do is go ahead
42:52 - and give it a height and width of a
42:53 - hundred percent
42:55 - right so if i go and do that you see now
42:57 - the videos fits perfectly inside right
42:59 - so it fits perfectly inside of there and
43:01 - what i'm gonna now do is also
43:04 - is because if you scroll through it now
43:07 - you'll notice that it's the snapping
43:09 - doesn't work
43:11 - yep it doesn't work right now yeah so it
43:14 - doesn't work right
43:15 - so we kind of had oh so firstly actually
43:17 - a good there's a good point now so i
43:18 - need to add the video card twice so let
43:20 - me add two video cards or three
43:22 - so we can actually visually see if there
43:23 - are two or three in there so i'm going
43:24 - to go ahead and add three
43:26 - so now you can like if i even wait it
43:28 - doesn't ever
43:30 - snap so it doesn't snap right
43:33 - so we set the parents or app videos we
43:35 - set this
43:36 - the scroll snapping behavior there but
43:38 - we need to set it to the child so now
43:40 - inside a video card we gave it
43:42 - video player right so inside of
43:45 - videocard.css what i'm going to do now
43:46 - is go over and target the parent
43:48 - container so video
43:49 - and i need to add the following lines i
43:51 - need to say give it a high-end width of
43:53 - 100
43:54 - pixels and give it the scroll snap
43:57 - align start property right
44:00 - so these are crucial in order to get
44:02 - that work right so what this is saying
44:04 - is it will take up 100 width this is
44:06 - huge i'm sorry to just keep interrupting
44:08 - but this is too good to not share
44:11 - uh bob's craig says let me
44:15 - uh he goes join profit with javascript
44:17 - it was the best decision of my life
44:19 - you're the best channel on youtube
44:21 - cleverprogrammer
44:22 - and you have helped me so much on my
44:24 - self-taught journey
44:27 - bro that's amazing right that is
44:29 - freaking crazy
44:30 - welcome to the community hopefully you
44:32 - even had a call with sunny
44:34 - but yeah yes thanks so much for just
44:37 - your vote of confidence and being a part
44:39 - of this community bob
44:40 - we love you appreciate you and thank you
44:42 - for saying that
44:44 - exactly and like honestly like i want to
44:46 - speak to each and every single one of
44:48 - you guys if i haven't already
44:50 - so we do the coaching calls i do my
44:52 - coaching call every tuesday so make sure
44:53 - you're there
44:54 - and i would love to chat to you uh in
44:56 - person on that zoom call so that'll be
44:58 - amazing yeah
44:59 - thank you dude um it's pretty nice so we
45:02 - just added that code
45:03 - which said that we would add a width of
45:06 - a height 100
45:07 - and a scroll snap align start right so
45:10 - now what we're going to do is because if
45:12 - you go ahead and scroll
45:13 - let's see if it's if it snaps
45:17 - it doesn't snap right now should i
45:22 - okay i just saved it anyways and i'm
45:24 - going to refresh and i'll try again
45:27 - not snapping right now no so we need to
45:30 - actually give it a position of relative
45:32 - right and this will make it relative to
45:34 - its parent container so if we do that
45:37 - we should see some snapping behavior
45:40 - so let's go ahead and try oh oops okay
45:43 - this threw me off this drew me up big
45:45 - time
45:45 - okay so it's because we actually changed
45:48 - the class names of video
45:50 - to video card right so inside a video
45:52 - card i need to actually go and do video
45:54 - card
45:55 - video oh man that's why yeah that's why
45:58 - i didn't want do
45:58 - [Music]
46:00 - okay nice awesome
46:03 - so if we go ahead and do that and then
46:05 - what we need to do also for video player
46:07 - i want to add you see it crops a little
46:08 - bit i want to make it object
46:10 - fit fill and what that does is it
46:12 - actually goes and fills the container
46:14 - all right so let's go ahead and scroll
46:16 - now
46:20 - yep there we go and it's rolling
46:25 - hold on let's see yep now it's snapping
46:29 - awesome so you see we get that snapping
46:31 - behavior guys
46:32 - that was fast yeah it's crazy right like
46:36 - this is such a neat little trick that i
46:38 - will always and guys this is what i want
46:40 - you to learn
46:40 - when you figure this out like a snapping
46:42 - sort of tutorial or you find something
46:44 - good
46:45 - hold on to that because that will help
46:47 - you in
46:48 - so many situations like if i had known
46:50 - this it would have made my life
46:52 - so much easier and so many other jobs i
46:54 - had worked on so
46:55 - take like add this to your portfolio and
46:57 - then have also have it as a reference to
46:59 - go back to you in the future when you're
47:01 - stuck on things and that sort of stuff
47:02 - because
47:03 - it will save you a bunch of time in your
47:05 - in your work
47:06 - i'm also going to add a border one pixel
47:08 - solid black to the card
47:10 - so that it's very apparent when we
47:11 - scroll through that there's a little
47:13 - border around it
47:14 - so that should help out a bit more in
47:16 - terms of
47:17 - visually seeing what's going on okay but
47:19 - with that said the styling is done
47:21 - okay for that uh what i'm going to go
47:23 - ahead and do is go back to the video
47:25 - card
47:26 - and now what i want to do is i want to
47:29 - make this functionality so that when we
47:31 - click the video
47:32 - it plays right so i want to add that
47:34 - function if we click the video it plays
47:36 - so in order to do that we need to make
47:40 - use of two
47:42 - react concepts we need to make use of
47:44 - the use state
47:45 - hook so the use state hook and the
47:48 - use ref hook okay now the use state is
47:52 - basically how we write variables inside
47:54 - of react
47:54 - so the first one i'm going to do is i'm
47:56 - going to have const and then that's how
47:58 - we first and
47:58 - initialize the variable and i'm going to
48:00 - say uh is video playing so is
48:02 - video playing right and this is going to
48:06 - keep track of if the video is playing
48:08 - yeah so it's literally going to start
48:09 - off as false but then if we click it we
48:11 - want to change that
48:12 - value to become true so what we need to
48:15 - do is
48:15 - actually go ahead and use uh the second
48:18 - argument here
48:19 - is set whatever the variable is called
48:21 - so set is video playing and this
48:23 - actually provides us
48:24 - a way of changing this value in the
48:27 - react fashion okay
48:29 - yeah literally just like setting a
48:31 - variable in
48:32 - react like this is the easiest way to
48:34 - think about it
48:36 - yeah but you're essentially using hooks
48:39 - exactly and you see here guys so it is
48:41 - dropping on the next line because we
48:43 - did for simplicity so we can see it but
48:45 - you can see it says use state and
48:47 - here we put the initial value okay so it
48:50 - says use state
48:51 - false right so now what i'm going to do
48:53 - is i first need to import
48:55 - the uh the use state hook
48:58 - right so i need to import at the top and
49:00 - then we should see it actually work okay
49:02 - so it works there so
49:03 - we have this value now i want to have it
49:06 - so that
49:07 - um when we click the video um i can
49:10 - actually change if that's playing or not
49:12 - okay
49:13 - now let's go ahead and double check
49:16 - something so
49:17 - what i'm going to do now is actually go
49:19 - ahead and say
49:21 - oh actually we don't actually need this
49:23 - value so i actually figured out a way of
49:25 - doing this actually simpler
49:26 - so let's go ahead and simplify this we
49:28 - don't need the use state we can actually
49:29 - just use a reference
49:30 - so what we have here is a reference so
49:32 - i'm going to go ahead and say video
49:33 - reference
49:35 - equals use ref right so i'm going to go
49:37 - ahead and change the import to use ref
49:40 - this is even simpler guys and now
49:42 - reference is basically saying
49:43 - it's like a pointer right a reference
49:45 - all it is is like a
49:46 - like imagine your reference is your
49:48 - finger pointing oh
49:50 - frank is back at it holy crap
49:55 - nice thing hold that i gotta i gotta
49:57 - bring that up real quick
49:59 - we love i love having frank
50:03 - you did yeah yeah frank was insane on
50:05 - the coaching club dude
50:07 - so actually he was insane and then he
50:11 - came with so much
50:12 - value from his years of experience um
50:14 - and i think he's massively provided yeah
50:16 - he massively brought it a lot
50:17 - that is amazing bro frank just donated
50:20 - ten dollars
50:21 - and he goes to react zoom call with
50:23 - sonny was awesome this tuesday
50:25 - it was fun sharing some of my journey
50:27 - with new developers
50:29 - yeah so what's crazy is frank is
50:31 - actually even adding more value to the
50:32 - program i love that
50:34 - yeah and guys this just goes to show you
50:37 - it doesn't matter like you could be
50:38 - super experienced you could be an
50:39 - absolute
50:40 - beginner like profitable javascript is
50:42 - literally catered for everyone
50:44 - so you could be a complete beginner and
50:45 - you can come or you can be somebody
50:46 - who's experienced
50:47 - and just come in to improve your skills
50:49 - and to be surrounded by
50:50 - positive like-minded people so really
50:53 - amazing to see frank in the comments
50:55 - nice yeah so remember guys i use ref
50:58 - right it's like
50:58 - it's like imagine like it's like just a
50:59 - way of like you're pointing at something
51:01 - right
51:01 - so initially we're gonna point at
51:03 - nothing so i'm gonna say no okay
51:05 - and then but but i want this to point to
51:07 - the video so i wanted to basically be a
51:09 - constant pointer
51:11 - to the video so i'm going to go ahead
51:13 - and and the way we do this with with
51:14 - using
51:15 - uh user f is simple super simple we just
51:17 - say ref equals
51:19 - uh ref sorry equals video ref video
51:22 - ref like this right
51:25 - and then i go ahead and pop that in and
51:27 - that's it like we pretty much
51:28 - we've we've now got our point now and
51:30 - we're pointing towards the video okay so
51:31 - we're pointing towards the video
51:32 - so with that said what we can do now is
51:35 - we can do more advanced things so now i
51:37 - can say
51:37 - on click so on whenever i click on the
51:40 - video
51:41 - are we using our react hooks here yeah
51:43 - so this is user f
51:45 - yeah so use reference react hook
51:49 - all right nice this is a big hook dude
51:54 - this is checked now we're gonna whenever
51:57 - we click the video
51:58 - i want to trigger a function called on
52:00 - video press but i do want to say that
52:02 - for
52:03 - people who are not react people it might
52:06 - scare you to learn about react hooks
52:09 - just as much as it's scaring this kid
52:11 - right here
52:12 - but guys just say how i think of some of
52:15 - the stuff that we're doing right now is
52:17 - literally just think of it like using
52:18 - variables
52:19 - in react you know and then as you get
52:21 - more advanced
52:23 - you can obviously like start to really
52:25 - learn how it's working under underneath
52:27 - the
52:28 - hood exactly yeah it's honestly like in
52:31 - this case
52:32 - use state was how you use a variable in
52:34 - react use ref
52:35 - is how we initialize sort of a way of
52:37 - pointing towards any element on the page
52:40 - so in this case we set it up to point at
52:42 - the video okay so that's all you that's
52:43 - the simplest way you need to think of it
52:45 - and here we did ref equals video ref to
52:47 - so now that our pointer is pointing
52:49 - towards the video itself
52:50 - i'm going to say when we click so on
52:52 - video press
52:53 - i'm going to basically create that
52:55 - function so i'm going to say const on
52:57 - video press here i'm going to say equals
53:00 - and basically
53:01 - this is an arrow function and i'm going
53:03 - to say right
53:05 - uh oh okay so i take it back i take back
53:08 - what i said earlier i do
53:09 - need that variable okay so i need to go
53:11 - ahead and say const
53:12 - is video playing so i do need that
53:14 - variable is video playing
53:16 - i thought i had it i thought i had it
53:18 - but um
53:21 - it's kind of i think you could do it
53:22 - without it but let's just save time and
53:24 - use this because i'll show you guys how
53:25 - to use the used hook
53:26 - so we do set is video playing
53:30 - and remember guys it's a variable in
53:31 - react so super simple we just say equals
53:33 - use state i'm going to initialize it
53:36 - with a value of false okay
53:37 - like that and here what i'm going to do
53:40 - is i need to import use state
53:42 - at the top someone say you stay at the
53:44 - top there we go
53:45 - now here i'm going to say if
53:49 - is video playing so if the video is
53:51 - playing
53:53 - then do this so then i want to stop the
53:56 - video
53:56 - no so if the video is yeah if the video
54:00 - is
54:00 - not playing so his video playing is by
54:02 - default false yeah so if the video is
54:04 - playing then i want to stop the video
54:06 - right else if it's not playing then i
54:10 - want to play the video okay
54:12 - i'm sure that's we've got that right
54:13 - yeah so if videos we have a good
54:15 - question here by the way
54:17 - by kelvin and kelvin says kazi are the
54:20 - resources given in the pwg
54:22 - course for a lifetime or not i want to
54:24 - sign up and i love to have them forever
54:26 - if that's possible
54:28 - so the resources like the training
54:31 - that's in the course that's actually
54:33 - their lifetime access
54:35 - the coaching calls you guys will have
54:37 - access to them
54:38 - as long as we're doing the coaching
54:40 - calls so we're actually legally not
54:42 - allowed to say forever because
54:44 - you know what if sonny gets you know
54:46 - some crazy say
54:47 - something happens to sonny god forbid so
54:50 - but as long as sunny is on the team and
54:53 - i'm here like we'll be running those
54:55 - coaching calls and you'll have access to
54:56 - them yes
54:58 - exactly yeah
55:02 - so um here we say if the video is
55:04 - playing we want to stop otherwise
55:06 - play the video right so if it if it's
55:09 - playing
55:09 - what i'm going to say is i'm going to
55:10 - use the video reference as our point now
55:12 - i'm going to say
55:12 - go and get the current thing that it's
55:14 - pointing at so that's how we
55:16 - use a reference and i'm just going to
55:17 - say play i don't know so in this case
55:19 - this one should be actually uh yeah i'm
55:21 - gonna say if the video is not playing
55:23 - so uh so it should be in this one so if
55:27 - the video
55:28 - is not playing then i'm gonna say play
55:30 - right otherwise
55:32 - i'm gonna say stop or pause is what we
55:36 - actually use here so pause
55:37 - right like this right and then what i
55:39 - need to do is i need to say set play
55:42 - so once you've actually set it to play
55:43 - or pause then we'll say if we set it to
55:45 - pause
55:46 - then i'm going gonna go oh no what
55:47 - happened there
55:51 - what the hell okay stop
55:54 - i just removed my code okay wait right
55:57 - now
55:59 - yes where's that now
56:02 - because i don't even undo anything
56:05 - and we do here set play as false because
56:08 - we're going to pause the video and then
56:09 - here i'm going to say set play as
56:11 - true okay like this awesome
56:14 - so and this will actually allow us to
56:16 - update the state and then it will allow
56:17 - us to
56:18 - know when the video is playing to pause
56:20 - it or if it's not playing to play it
56:22 - okay now with that said what i'm going
56:25 - to do is i'm going to go ahead and
56:26 - actually
56:27 - uh so it says set play is not oh yeah
56:30 - sorry
56:31 - set is video playing so it should be set
56:33 - as video playing
56:34 - to true there we go now i'm gonna go
56:38 - ahead and save it okay so
56:39 - cozy go ahead and click the video okay
56:50 - [Music]
56:52 - all right i'll pause it
56:55 - hey see it pause and then if we click it
56:57 - again that's beautiful
57:01 - [Music]
57:03 - right and even if we scroll to and so if
57:05 - we pause this one and we scroll to
57:07 - another one
57:08 - you'll see that behavior is carried out
57:09 - through each of the components right it
57:11 - says
57:12 - behavior oh damn and this one is pause
57:14 - where it was
57:17 - [Music]
57:18 - you see we have that really nice
57:19 - behavior
57:21 - yeah that's beautiful amazing behavior
57:24 - dude
57:25 - yeah and we we do this by using a piece
57:28 - of state saying is video playing to keep
57:30 - track
57:30 - of when it's playing and then we use the
57:32 - video reference which is our pointer so
57:34 - it's literally like a
57:35 - thing that just points at an element on
57:37 - the page we use that to basically go
57:40 - ahead and control the video so we say if
57:42 - it was playing based on our state
57:44 - then go ahead and pause it and then
57:45 - update the state to say that it's now
57:46 - paused so it's not playing
57:48 - and then if it wasn't playing then go
57:50 - ahead and play it and tell
57:51 - the react so tell the variable in the
57:53 - memory to say that it should now become
57:55 - true
57:55 - so that's how we go ahead and do that
57:57 - sunny
57:59 - yep check this out bro
58:05 - go for it look how to automatically
58:08 - how to auto save automatically with
58:10 - visual studio code
58:12 - we actually made a video out of it
58:15 - out of this current live stream that
58:17 - we're doing dude
58:20 - i was like why is quasi showing other
58:22 - youtube videos
58:24 - yeah and then i realized i was like
58:25 - that's obvious oh [ __ ]
58:27 - nice yeah it's our video so
58:30 - uh yeah this if you guys can help us
58:32 - with this too
58:33 - we found out how to clip youtube videos
58:35 - while we're live
58:36 - so if you can actually time if you like
58:38 - something a lot
58:39 - during the video that we're doing just
58:41 - drop the time stamp i mean
58:43 - you don't have to give us the end time
58:45 - stamp that would be great if you could
58:46 - give us
58:47 - the start and end but let's just say you
58:49 - just gave us a start and you
58:51 - really loved some part or you thought
58:54 - hey i love the feature like you showed
58:56 - us
58:56 - autosave because the greatest ever right
58:59 - and i think said this is a really useful
59:01 - feature
59:02 - in the comments so as soon as he said
59:04 - that i realized it and then we
59:06 - i told frankie and then we just clipped
59:07 - it so
59:09 - if you guys want to have separate videos
59:12 - maybe you really like
59:13 - how sunny explain use hooks or use
59:16 - reference or the snapping functionality
59:19 - you can give us the timestamp for that
59:21 - and then we'll just put that video up on
59:23 - youtube for you and then you can just
59:25 - watch it on your own time
59:27 - exactly yeah so go ahead and let us know
59:29 - the timestamps
59:31 - in the comments and that will really
59:32 - really help us pull out uh
59:34 - those clips so if somebody yeah if
59:36 - somebody could
59:37 - um sonny remember what you were going to
59:39 - say just now you're about to say
59:40 - something okay just remember that please
59:42 - but if somebody could drop the timestamp
59:45 - of where sunny showed how to use the
59:48 - scroll bar functionality and it goes
59:51 - through the entire explanation that
59:52 - would be amazing we'll love to drop that
59:54 - as a separate video
59:56 - then people could watch it and get tons
59:58 - of value but sunny go ahead you were
59:59 - going to say something
60:01 - i was just going to say literally if you
60:02 - could go ahead and drop timestamps guys
60:04 - of like because he said
60:06 - he gave an example uh and what we can do
60:08 - is we can go ahead and clip them so you
60:09 - can you can you guys can
60:11 - it actually provides you guys a lot of
60:12 - value so we're trying to help you guys
60:14 - go ahead and have videos that you can
60:15 - refer back to
60:16 - whenever you're stuck in situations like
60:18 - how to get the scroll bars hidden
60:21 - yes 100 and david who joined the prophet
60:25 - javascript course last week he says
60:27 - thanks suny and qazi so much knowledge
60:29 - wealth and willingness to share
60:31 - appreciate your mentorship
60:32 - and guidance on this journey thank you
60:34 - bro
60:35 - awesome thank you dude i appreciate you
60:38 - nice
60:39 - so we got the video working right so
60:43 - that was actually really slick
60:44 - like that was a really nice
60:45 - implementation i saw somebody ask why
60:48 - did i set use ref to no so the initial
60:50 - value you have to give it something
60:52 - right
60:53 - it's always safe to give it a no value
60:54 - in this case because we don't want it we
60:56 - wanted to point we were
60:57 - explicitly saying start off by not
61:00 - pointing at anything so it's no
61:02 - right and then on line 23 i'm saying
61:05 - uh go ahead and make that reference the
61:07 - video reference
61:08 - so that's where the the binding happens
61:10 - right let's just be
61:12 - more more brutal about this one thing
61:14 - because i keep forgetting as well
61:16 - let's just always make sure we know what
61:19 - we're building
61:20 - so then we can actually write it out at
61:22 - the top
61:23 - uh pretty much at all given times you
61:26 - know even if i forget so
61:28 - what is the main big functionality in
61:30 - english that we're working on right now
61:33 - so we're now going to build the video
61:35 - header
61:36 - so you know on top of the header so we
61:38 - have a back button
61:40 - hold on let me open the app and then you
61:42 - can show me so i'll go to
61:44 - this is our app yeah so when you say the
61:48 - reels header are you talking about or
61:50 - you're talking about this for the video
61:52 - card header exactly okay cool yeah
61:55 - so this is going to be the header and
61:57 - then what are we going to do after that
62:00 - so after that we're going to be building
62:02 - the video footer
62:03 - okay including the ticker
62:07 - including the ticker yeah including the
62:10 - things that you see at the bottom
62:11 - is yep all right got it
62:15 - so this is just for road mapping you
62:16 - guys what we're going to be working on
62:18 - specifically and in what order and then
62:20 - what are we going to do after that
62:22 - uh and then we are going to go ahead and
62:25 - actually re refactor everything so that
62:29 - the information is no longer being put
62:31 - in a hard coded fashion but we're
62:32 - putting it from a database
62:34 - okay then database okay so i think this
62:36 - is good for now
62:37 - as into like what we're about to do and
62:39 - then i'll add we're working on the
62:40 - header for now so
62:41 - everybody knows uh what exactly we're
62:45 - working on so we're gonna add that to
62:46 - the top you guys should see that popping
62:48 - up in just a second
62:49 - that said i'll i'll stop interrupting
62:51 - your flow
62:52 - you go ahead and do your thing awesome i
62:55 - think it's a really good practice as
62:56 - well so i think we
62:57 - i'll definitely try and pick up on it
62:58 - more because i think that's really even
63:00 - when i watch the videos back
63:01 - it's really handy to see what we're
63:03 - working on it's for it's kind of
63:04 - unnatural to do it
63:06 - it doesn't feel necessarily good to
63:09 - block your flow
63:10 - but i think that it is super helpful as
63:13 - a viewer
63:14 - like it just changes my experience
63:15 - completely i hate not
63:18 - exactly knowing what we're working on
63:20 - exactly
63:21 - yeah so really really uh it will help
63:24 - them out a lot
63:25 - uh nice so we're gonna go ahead and
63:27 - create the video header component next
63:29 - so i'm going to go ahead and mask it i'm
63:31 - going to say video header like this
63:33 - and it's going to cry and freak out
63:34 - because we don't have a video header
63:36 - component so i'm going to go ahead and
63:36 - create once i'm going to say
63:38 - videoheader.js
63:41 - videoheader.js like this and
63:43 - [Music]
63:45 - after five minutes it will pop through
63:47 - so
63:49 - there we go we should there we go nice
63:52 - all right and i think my snippets might
63:54 - not be working so you might have to oh
63:56 - no
63:56 - oh wait it did work it did work rfce
63:59 - let's give it a sec boom there we go
64:03 - nice so i'm going to go ahead and import
64:05 - so import
64:07 - video header like this videoheader.css
64:12 - like this and i'm going to go ahead and
64:14 - create that file so videoheader.css
64:18 - and it should pop in in a second
64:21 - when we when that file is created and
64:24 - that will allow us to import that css
64:26 - code into the component so that we can
64:27 - style it
64:28 - just isolate from everything else so now
64:30 - we've got that file
64:32 - up and running this nice so what i'm
64:34 - going to do now is
64:35 - go ahead and add the class name so we
64:37 - can style it later so i'm going to say
64:39 - class name equals
64:40 - video header like that and for this
64:44 - now what we're going to go ahead and do
64:46 - is actually begin and install
64:48 - material ui into the app so that we can
64:50 - actually go ahead and use the icons
64:53 - for later so that we can go ahead and
64:54 - use everything that we need to use from
64:56 - material ui
64:57 - as we need it so kazi let's go ahead and
64:58 - on the right side let's open up material
65:00 - ui
65:03 - and let's show them how to install what
65:05 - we need to install for materials so this
65:07 - is how it works guys make sure you get
65:09 - this over here
65:10 - npm install material ui core
65:13 - pop open your terminal and i'm just
65:16 - going to open up a new one here so i
65:18 - don't end our
65:20 - local and boom i'm gonna do npm install
65:23 - ui core
65:24 - and then i'll pop open another one here
65:27 - and uh make sure you do npm install
65:30 - material ui icons now before and while
65:33 - it's installing
65:34 - i'm gonna explain why we're going to be
65:36 - using this
65:37 - so every single icon that you guys see
65:40 - here
65:41 - for example this camera right there
65:45 - this back arrow here the heart emoji
65:48 - the comment function uh uh comment
65:52 - icon heart here the share one
65:56 - all of these are coming from material ui
65:58 - that's what we're gonna be using
66:00 - for all of our icons so
66:04 - this is going to be installing and
66:06 - material ui is done installing now what
66:08 - i want you to do
66:10 - is hit icons click go into icons
66:14 - and in here make sure you click where it
66:17 - says
66:18 - search the full list of icons so boom
66:21 - right
66:21 - over there this is the command that you
66:24 - should have typed in
66:25 - if you haven't already make sure you
66:27 - install the icons
66:29 - now once i'm inside of this
66:37 - you will see all of these icons pop up
66:39 - so i can look for a menu
66:42 - or i can look for home whatever you're
66:45 - looking for
66:46 - most of it will be here and that's where
66:48 - we're going to be pulling them out for
66:50 - our app exactly guys and
66:53 - if you go ahead and click one of those
66:55 - icons it shows you the
66:57 - importing code that you need yep so
67:00 - for example let's do a video or let's do
67:03 - like share because that's the one or i
67:06 - think for sure you're using
67:07 - message this one here send so if you
67:10 - click
67:11 - send you have the code right here and
67:14 - you can
67:15 - add it in your file exactly so whenever
67:18 - you guys see us
67:19 - importing stuff that's how you know how
67:21 - we found it how we search for it
67:23 - and that's really something powerful
67:25 - that they go ahead and provide
67:26 - for you um so i can see a lot of people
67:28 - are talking about the icon pack yeah as
67:30 - soon as we like honestly i use these all
67:32 - the time as well so they're really
67:33 - really useful
67:34 - uh and they're really really powerful
67:36 - because they save you so much time and
67:37 - they're very clean
67:38 - and they're scalable as well so you can
67:40 - scale them up and down and the svg
67:42 - so it's going to look clean it's
67:43 - actually fonts not svg so it actually is
67:45 - really nice in that sense
67:47 - okay so i'm going to go ahead and import
67:49 - two
67:50 - uh two different um
67:53 - files now so the arrow back icon and a
67:56 - camera icon so here i'm going to go
67:57 - ahead and import
67:58 - those so you can see i popped them in so
68:00 - the first one is the arrow
68:02 - back icon so that's the name that they
68:05 - give you
68:05 - and the second one is camera alt
68:07 - outlined icon so that's the outline of a
68:10 - camera
68:10 - okay so what i'm going to do is i want
68:12 - to have three things i want to have the
68:14 - arrow back icon so
68:15 - in order to use it all we do is
68:16 - literally use it as a component so we go
68:18 - ahead and do that
68:20 - that means that the icon will now appear
68:21 - on the screen so kazi let's have the
68:23 - local
68:24 - host open so we can see yes
68:27 - let's have the local boom right here
68:30 - nice so it's just not defined so just
68:32 - import it
68:33 - probably yeah so now i need to import
68:37 - video header from oops
68:40 - video header like that and go ahead and
68:42 - save
68:44 - uh and then it says does not contain a
68:47 - default okay so
68:48 - video header does not contain a default
68:50 - it does contain default that's strange
68:52 - so let's go ahead oh yeah there we go
68:53 - nice now we should see at the top can
68:55 - you see there's a very small arrow and
68:57 - you've got like a white background
68:58 - behind it right
68:59 - so you see there's a little little back
69:01 - arrow okay we've got that
69:03 - then i'm going to have a h3 tag so i'm
69:05 - going to go ahead and do a h3
69:07 - and this is going to have a rules on it
69:09 - so it's just going to say h3 and it's
69:10 - going to say rules
69:11 - and then i'm going to have oh i need to
69:13 - do that and then i'm going to add that
69:15 - camera icon afterwards at the end so i'm
69:17 - going to go ahead and do this and say
69:19 - camera alt
69:20 - icon right so now we should see the back
69:23 - icon
69:24 - rules and the camera icon perfect okay
69:27 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
69:28 - target this video header right and if
69:31 - you already guessed it i'm hoping some
69:32 - of you guys know
69:33 - by now what i love and that is flexbox
69:36 - so i'm going to go ahead and do display
69:39 - flex on this and that will automatically
69:42 - sort of pull
69:42 - everything into a row so
69:47 - that will pull everything into a row and
69:49 - that will look very clean
69:51 - and you can see there is and then i'm
69:53 - going to go ahead and do justify content
69:55 - space between
69:56 - and that will actually go ahead and
69:57 - spread those three elements out which is
69:59 - really nice
70:00 - i'm going to align item center i'm going
70:02 - to give it a width a line item center
70:05 - there we go um so
70:08 - we should see everything's all will
70:09 - become in an alignment with its
70:11 - center and then i'm going to say
70:13 - position absolute so i wanted to overlay
70:15 - the video right
70:16 - so i went over there and two in order to
70:18 - what i do is if i do a position absolute
70:20 - this will actually just sit on top of
70:22 - the video so if i do position absolute
70:23 - watch what happens
70:26 - uh let's go ahead and see so i think we
70:28 - need to refresh localhost 3000
70:30 - because it does that weird thing
70:31 - sometimes when it gets stuck
70:35 - yep so now you can see it it did it but
70:37 - notice what it did now so whenever you
70:39 - do position absolute
70:41 - you have to say width of 100 because it
70:44 - it sort of changed the layout constraint
70:46 - so now if i go ahead and do width 100
70:49 - now you will see it uses up the full
70:52 - width okay which is clean but it
70:54 - overlays the video now because
70:56 - we change the positioning type to
70:58 - something called position absolute
71:00 - now remember i said it's not an svg it's
71:02 - a font
71:03 - so i can actually go ahead and do color
71:06 - white
71:06 - and it's as simple as that and i can do
71:08 - that and then what i want to do is
71:10 - to do the icing on the cake is we it's
71:12 - white now i want to give
71:14 - every child element 20 pixels
71:17 - icing on the cake for you buddy i got
71:20 - dicing on the cake for you
71:23 - all right here we go so github says
71:26 - thanks a lot sunny and quasi i was
71:28 - offered a job

72:21 - following along and building the clones
72:23 - with us that's everything to us so
72:25 - everyone just just drop a massive
72:27 - congratulations in the comments for that
72:29 - amazing work there
72:30 - that's awesome that is huge guys and if
72:33 - you enjoy him getting a job then make
72:35 - sure you smash that like button
72:38 - let's go
72:44 - that was almost smooth that was almost
72:46 - smooth
72:48 - oh my god you scared me jesus
72:52 - christ jump in here in the camera guys
72:55 - this is my girlfriend
72:57 - hi right there
73:00 - we're live right now and uh somebody
73:04 - just got a job
73:05 - oh let's go they built our clones
73:08 - yeah they went to an interview and then
73:11 - they got the job
73:12 - nice that's what's up that's crazy
73:15 - have fun guys thanks baby we love that
73:18 - energy
73:19 - oh boy oh boy
73:23 - that's crazy awesome guys so let's keep
73:28 - on with that energy
73:29 - because we love that so remember i said
73:31 - that the icons
73:33 - right so those icons that we saw were
73:36 - actually
73:36 - sort of they were spread out but they
73:39 - didn't have any spacing between them
73:40 - right so it was a bit of a headache it's
73:42 - a bit annoying so because let's open up
73:43 - localhost 3000.
73:45 - nice so we just added that code which
73:47 - said
73:48 - that go okay yep here we go
73:52 - so localhost yep
73:55 - and then you see those icons at the top
73:58 - so the back arrow the rules and the
74:00 - camera icon
74:01 - to actually target any child and give it
74:03 - padding so that's what i want to do i
74:05 - don't want to say give each one a class
74:06 - name and do all that headache
74:07 - i'm just gonna say target all the
74:09 - children so everything underneath there
74:11 - and give a padding at 20 pixels because
74:12 - that's a nice slick queen you see what i
74:14 - did they went ahead target the children
74:16 - gave each one 20 pixels padding and then
74:19 - boom my bad
74:20 - one sorry about that so
74:24 - sometimes when i play a video it plays
74:26 - the sound
74:28 - so um apologize about that a little bit
74:30 - but now it should be good so
74:32 - it should be good oh i see
74:35 - that's why it was nice okay so
74:38 - now what we're gonna do is we are going
74:40 - to that's the video header complete guys
74:43 - so remember this is more of a that's a
74:45 - visual sort of component that we built
74:48 - we're going to go ahead and build a
74:49 - functional component now something which
74:51 - actually has a bit more functionality it
74:52 - makes use of props so if you're excited
74:54 - about that
74:54 - smash the thumbs up button um we're
74:57 - going to go ahead and
74:59 - we're going to go ahead and go to video
75:01 - card and
75:02 - look guys this is what i love about the
75:04 - component-based design right look you've
75:05 - got the header
75:07 - literally at the top you've got the
75:08 - video and then i'm going to go under
75:10 - here and do a video
75:11 - footer so you see like it's just so
75:14 - clean
75:15 - like it's super clean it's super nice
75:17 - and obviously reacts gonna scream and
75:19 - kick
75:19 - kick itself because we haven't got that
75:21 - component so i'm going to go ahead and
75:22 - create that one so i'm going to say
75:23 - video
75:24 - footer dot js like that and
75:28 - this should be created in just a sec
75:34 - uh the greatest ever just dropped a good
75:36 - comment it says for those that do not
75:37 - understand
75:38 - why these clones are so powerful in your
75:39 - portfolio they actually demonstrate that
75:42 - you have the necessary skills
75:44 - to build a proven great app among other
75:46 - things and i agree with them i think
75:48 - if you can go ahead and follow it
75:51 - tutorial especially the in-depth ones
75:53 - like the amazon builds and you can go
75:55 - ahead and
75:55 - go ahead and get them like working and
75:57 - everything and up and running
75:58 - amazing and like if you have enough of
76:00 - those on your portfolio and then you
76:02 - build go ahead and build a custom
76:03 - portfolio
76:04 - it's just like it's it's gonna impress
76:06 - some people and that's why you were you
76:07 - were psyched about that sonny but here's
76:09 - what i'm psyched about
76:10 - becky g is back with his friends to
76:12 - watch these amazing people let's
76:15 - go becky nice i love that
76:20 - um all right i'm gonna do rfce
76:24 - and we should have our snippet
76:28 - in a sec no no we don't have to be i
76:31 - think you're gonna have to oh no oh i
76:32 - got it there we go
76:33 - video footer nice so i'm going to go
76:35 - ahead and give it a class name
76:37 - to stay in line with them so i'm going
76:38 - to go ahead and say cast name equals
76:41 - video footer like that okay now the
76:44 - footer
76:44 - is a bit more of a complicated component
76:46 - right so it's not essentially too
76:48 - complicated but
76:50 - the footer we need to pass something
76:53 - called props
76:54 - right so let's go back to
76:57 - the video itself right now we have a
76:59 - video playing
77:00 - and we pretty much just have a static
77:02 - video playing so we don't actually
77:03 - do anything fancy we don't actually say
77:05 - it's just what we're doing is rendering
77:06 - a video card right
77:08 - so i'm going to go ahead and enhance
77:09 - this a little bit i'm going to say each
77:11 - video
77:11 - has the hold on hold on sunny
77:15 - yep okay got it i was just
77:19 - thinking that it wasn't following you
77:20 - for a second i couldn't see
77:22 - code okay cool should be good now keep
77:25 - going
77:25 - yeah so what we're gonna do is rather
77:28 - than rendering out the video card by
77:30 - itself
77:30 - i'm going to go ahead and render out the
77:32 - video card but actually go ahead and
77:34 - show you
77:35 - um we're going to pass through a bunch
77:37 - of props
77:38 - so imagine these are the props that
77:39 - we're going to pass through so we're
77:40 - going to pass through the channel the
77:41 - avatar source so the avatar image that
77:44 - you see for the person's account
77:46 - the song that is currently playing the
77:49 - url and that's the url of the video
77:51 - the likes on their account so if they
77:53 - have 300. are we done with the header
77:56 - yeah we are done with the header now
77:57 - damn it sonny god damn you gotta tell
77:59 - him we're done
78:00 - all right here we go i actually did say
78:03 - at that point but i will
78:04 - i was shy on it no no you have to yell
78:06 - at me you have to yell at like
78:08 - i grew up with a dad that used to slap
78:10 - me to take a left turn somewhere
78:12 - or yell at me i can't understand when
78:15 - you'll just say it super calmly
78:17 - so now we're changing we're basically
78:20 - going to now we're going to make a
78:23 - footer
78:25 - yeah well we're doing the photo but
78:26 - before we do that we have where thanks
78:27 - to dinesh i caught that denise drop that
78:29 - in the comment thank you for that
78:30 - donation
78:32 - we're passing the props through the
78:34 - video card component
78:35 - so that's the first what we're doing
78:37 - right now got it
78:39 - yeah so what we're going to do is we're
78:41 - going to have the channel so the channel
78:43 - in this case let's go ahead and hard
78:44 - code this for now we're going to say
78:45 - clever
78:46 - kazi like this and it'll say avatar
78:49 - image
78:49 - so this avatar image right now i'm going
78:51 - to go ahead and grab a
78:53 - value so i have sort of i think it's
78:56 - quasi's profile picture at this point so
78:58 - let's go ahead and do this avatar source
79:00 - equals and that's
79:01 - just some huge one that i have and then
79:03 - the song we can just say
79:05 - test song so you guys can see right now
79:07 - so it's test song by
79:08 - let's just say sss anger so it's mine
79:12 - instagram and then we can say url so the
79:15 - url video so the euro of the video so
79:17 - rather than hard coding in the next step
79:18 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
79:19 - pull it at this point so i've got the
79:20 - url over here so i'm going to go ahead
79:22 - and grab that
79:23 - so this one right here and let's go
79:26 - ahead and do boom
79:27 - so we pop it in there and then the likes
79:30 - right so for the likes
79:31 - i'm just going to pass in the number so
79:32 - i'm going to say 950 likes
79:35 - uh let's just say 300 or you know 30
79:37 - shares or something like that right
79:39 - so you can distinguish between the two
79:40 - so now we've got properties are being
79:42 - passed through as opposed to hard coding
79:44 - everything else right
79:45 - so let's go ahead and do that so
79:48 - now we're going to do is inside a video
79:51 - card
79:52 - the props come through as an object so
79:54 - they come through over here as an object
79:56 - and in order to go ahead and destructure
79:59 - the object so that we can use it
80:01 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
80:03 - basically go ahead and destructure at
80:05 - this point so i'm going to add the
80:06 - brackets
80:07 - uh so we're basically splitting it apart
80:09 - at this point i'm going to get the url
80:11 - i'm going to get the likes the shares
80:13 - i'm going to get the channel
80:14 - i'm going to get the avatar source so
80:17 - the avatar source is the
80:18 - picture of the of the person who's uh
80:21 - whose account
80:21 - is and i'm going to get the song so now
80:23 - i've got those properties that we passed
80:25 - through
80:25 - earlier okay so that means that we can
80:28 - use that so i'm going to go ahead and
80:29 - what is that
80:30 - yep so we're going and use that so now
80:32 - what i can do
80:34 - is rather than passing in a hard-coded
80:36 - value here
80:37 - i can go ahead and replace this with
80:40 - the uh url so that's the url
80:44 - the oak we can leave here the class name
80:45 - we can leave okay
80:47 - awesome but where do i use the rest of
80:50 - the properties and i'm going to actually
80:51 - use them in the video footer
80:52 - so inside of here is where i'm going to
80:54 - pass through the rest so i'm going to
80:55 - pass through the channel the likes the
80:57 - shares
80:57 - the avatar url and the song so i'm going
81:00 - to pass in
81:01 - these properties through the video
81:04 - footer
81:04 - right and then again remember we're
81:07 - passing through the props at this point
81:10 - right so es6 allows us to destructure so
81:12 - we're pulling apart
81:14 - the object at this point and we can go
81:17 - ahead
81:18 - and do the following so i can go ahead
81:20 - and pull the channel the song
81:22 - the likes the shares and the avatar url
81:25 - so i can go ahead and pull that
81:26 - from the the video footer like that okay
81:30 - so we can do that and then what i'm
81:32 - going to do is
81:33 - we need to go ahead and basically add
81:35 - the video first this is the most
81:37 - complicated of the components that we're
81:39 - going to build
81:40 - um but we'll get there okay we'll get
81:42 - there so
81:43 - the first thing we're going to do is why
81:45 - is it erroring it's saying video photo
81:46 - is not defined and that's happening
81:47 - because in video card we haven't
81:48 - actually imported it so let's go ahead
81:50 - and do that so we're going to say
81:52 - import video card
81:56 - import video footer from video footer
81:59 - there we go
82:00 - done save and we should see it says
82:03 - video photo has already been declared no
82:05 - there we go
82:06 - nice so in order to get to be sure that
82:08 - this is working also remember guys
82:10 - just good habit we want to import the
82:13 - video for
82:13 - css and create that so we can style it
82:15 - afterwards so video footer.css
82:18 - like this i'm going to go ahead and
82:19 - create this and we'll say
82:21 - videofooter.css
82:23 - create that file we should snap into it
82:25 - in a second
82:27 - so in a second that will drop in
82:32 - right now
82:35 - yeah we're in that file so now we're
82:37 - going to do is we have
82:39 - the so the first thing i want to do is
82:40 - actually go ahead and use an avatar so
82:42 - an avatar is like a user profile image
82:44 - and material ui give us a really nice
82:46 - way of pulling that in so i need to go
82:48 - ahead and put in the following so
82:50 - i'm going to use a button from material
82:51 - ui later so i'm importing it now
82:53 - and i'm going to use an avatar so the
82:55 - avatar is this little circle icon that
82:57 - you see
82:57 - for a user's image so what i'm going to
83:00 - do
83:01 - is i'm going to pass in i'm going to use
83:03 - it like this and i'm going to say that
83:04 - the
83:06 - the prop is going to be the avatar's
83:09 - image right
83:10 - so now if we save this we should see at
83:12 - some point or somewhere
83:14 - um let's go ahead and see so i'm going
83:16 - to go ahead and style video footer so we
83:18 - can actually go ahead and see this
83:20 - so video footer i'm going to say
83:23 - is so firstly i'm going to have a few
83:27 - sections
83:27 - to this video first so with the first
83:29 - section i'm going to have the text
83:31 - now the text is going to be where it
83:33 - says the the it has the avatar it will
83:36 - say like clever kazi and then it will
83:37 - say follow
83:38 - right and follow will be a clickable
83:40 - button so in this section i'm going to
83:41 - say div
83:42 - so it's going to be a div here like this
83:45 - and
83:46 - the class name for that div is going to
83:48 - be video first so i'm going to say class
83:50 - name
83:51 - is video footer video footer
83:54 - like that right and we're going to put
83:56 - the avatar image inside of there
83:58 - like that okay and then i'm also going
84:00 - to have a h3 tag and now this h3 tag
84:04 - is gonna have the channel name it's
84:05 - gonna have a little dot between it and
84:07 - it's gonna have a material ui button
84:09 - which says follow
84:10 - okay so it's gonna just be that it's
84:12 - just gonna have those things and then
84:13 - what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna style
84:14 - this
84:15 - so we gave it um oh what happened there
84:20 - okay so there we go so i'm going to go
84:22 - ahead and do video footer
84:24 - text i don't know why that happens um
84:26 - yeah but there we go video for a text
84:28 - okay now
84:31 - why is that being okay yeah so now what
84:34 - we're going to do is we're going to
84:35 - style video footer text okay so i'm
84:37 - going to go inside here and i'm going to
84:38 - say it's target the video for a text
84:40 - and i'm going to go ahead and do the
84:41 - following i'm going to say it's gonna
84:43 - have a position
84:44 - of absolute right so because if we go
84:47 - ahead and refresh localhost 3000
84:49 - before i apply this yep
84:53 - so localhost 3000
85:00 - yep so position absolute and this should
85:04 - now sit on top
85:06 - of the video so once it should snap in
85:09 - in a second and we should see it at some
85:12 - point on top but what i need to do is i
85:13 - need to say
85:14 - bottom is a zero and then what i need to
85:17 - do
85:18 - is i need to set the parent container so
85:20 - video
85:21 - footer i need to go ahead and say oh so
85:23 - it has it has popped in you can see at
85:25 - the bottom so we don't need that right
85:26 - so at the top at the bottom you can see
85:27 - it
85:28 - it says cleverkazy and it says follow
85:30 - right now in order to get that into a
85:32 - row
85:33 - i'm going to do display flex whoa joshua
85:35 - thomas thank you dude for
85:36 - five dollar donation wow thank you for
85:39 - that yeah i just saw that come in right
85:40 - now too thank you so much for the five
85:42 - dollar donation
85:44 - let me see if i can pop it up on the
85:46 - screen
85:48 - let me see boom right there
85:51 - thank you joshua appreciate it massively
85:54 - appreciate that
85:55 - awesome dude let me take that away nice
85:58 - so i'm going to change the color because
86:00 - remember it's just
86:01 - it's just text that we're using so i'm
86:02 - going to say color white and i'm going
86:04 - to say display flex
86:05 - because i want it to be next to each
86:07 - other so display flex
86:09 - and if i go ahead and do that oh okay
86:11 - yeah we'll go ahead and do that
86:13 - now we should see boom it pops in at the
86:16 - bottom
86:16 - nice uh and what i'm going to do now is
86:19 - i'm going to say
86:20 - that i want a margin bottom of 20 pixels
86:23 - okay it's a margin bottom of 20 pixels
86:26 - like this and you see it kind of drops a
86:28 - little bit more
86:29 - from the from the bottom because we want
86:31 - to have a little bit of a gap okay
86:33 - so with that said now i'm going to
86:35 - target the text inside so it's a h3
86:38 - inside of that and i'm going to say
86:40 - right now it's touching the avatar i
86:41 - don't want it to touch avatar so i'm
86:43 - going to go ahead and do
86:44 - this and i'm going to say video for
86:47 - underscore underscore text h3 so it's
86:50 - the direct child which is the uh
86:52 - the basically the h3 what we're
86:54 - targeting is this one here so h3
86:56 - and i'm going to go ahead and say inside
86:58 - the video for text h3 you give it a
87:00 - margin left to 10 pixels and a padding
87:02 - bomb
87:02 - of 20 pixels okay so you can see that
87:05 - now
87:06 - it's styled the text a little bit
87:07 - differently and then i'm going to go
87:09 - ahead and do the same thing for the
87:10 - button because remember
87:12 - i have a button inside of that h3
87:15 - because i want the follow button to be
87:17 - clickable so all i can do is i can go
87:19 - ahead and nest it and i can say target
87:21 - the video footer
87:22 - text div the h3 and then the button
87:25 - inside the h3
87:26 - give the text of the button to white
87:28 - make it bold
87:30 - and then text transform inherit
87:31 - basically material ui by default
87:35 - just puts everything in the uh uppercase
87:37 - which we didn't want we don't want that
87:38 - because that's not how it looks on
87:40 - instagram rails so i don't inherit which
87:42 - basically says
87:43 - do the default thing that your parent
87:45 - the parent container did so
87:47 - that's what that did and it made it
87:48 - lower case so now you can see we've got
87:50 - the first bit done
87:50 - we've got the video for a text working
87:53 - really nice okay
87:54 - the next thing we're going to do is the
87:57 - ticker
87:58 - all right so the ticker is that little
88:00 - icon which scrolls with the song
88:02 - right so it just has a little scrolling
88:04 - song so whatever song it's playing
88:06 - you'll just scroll through and it'll
88:07 - just keep repeating itself
88:08 - i don't want to code up all of that sort
88:10 - of logic so what i went ahead and did is
88:12 - pulled out a module and this is a good
88:14 - use case to show you guys
88:16 - you don't need to code everything from
88:17 - scratch you need you can reuse code you
88:19 - can reuse third-party
88:21 - um with that body things and yeah you
88:23 - can pretty much go ahead and do that
88:25 - so now let's go ahead and open the
88:27 - terminal quasi
88:30 - so command j and then we're going to do
88:34 - mpm
88:35 - i also i can't actually i'm in are you
88:38 - in three or two
88:39 - let me go inside no so i think i need to
88:43 - go into two
88:44 - so let me go into three and request
88:45 - freedom right
88:47 - okay do it yeah there we go
88:50 - and if i do mpm can you see that
88:53 - no nope
88:57 - um i see it i see it it's it says for me
88:59 - it says two for you it probably says
89:01 - three
89:03 - but i see your npm now so go ahead type
89:05 - np yeah there we go npm i
89:07 - if i do react ticker right
89:11 - and then what that will do is it will
89:12 - install the correct thing
89:14 - right so one second
89:21 - aditya says thank you kazi and sunny sir
89:24 - you both have helped me a lot and my
89:26 - life has changed after watching
89:28 - this clone series that's awesome bro
89:32 - thank you dude awesome so now
89:35 - what we're gonna do is we are going to
89:38 - use that ticker
89:39 - right so the ticker firstly i want a
89:42 - music icon
89:43 - so i want a little music icon to show
89:45 - next to the ticker
89:46 - so let's go ahead and prepare this so
89:48 - firstly you know i want to i want to div
89:50 - i want a div and this div cast name is
89:52 - going to be oh i hate when he does that
89:53 - yeah
89:53 - this day of class name is going to be
89:57 - video footer underscore underscore
90:01 - uh i'm going to say ticker like that
90:03 - yeah so video
90:04 - ticker like that and then basically i'm
90:06 - going to use a music note icon so here
90:09 - i'm going to go ahead and import this
90:10 - from material ui
90:11 - like this and i'm going to go ahead and
90:14 - use this
90:15 - i'm going to give it a class name as
90:16 - well because i want to style it and i'm
90:18 - going to show you guys how you can yes
90:19 - you can target the material ui class
90:21 - name
90:22 - but or you can just give it a class name
90:23 - and it's easier to find right so we're
90:24 - going to go ahead and do that
90:26 - so if i go ahead and save that right now
90:30 - so it's complaining why is it
90:32 - complaining
90:33 - it's saying no such file or directory
90:37 - interior ui call did you do material ui
90:41 - you did install material ui i did yes
90:44 - the core right
90:45 - yeah so we package json we should be
90:48 - able to see
90:52 - that install it so hold on let's install
90:55 - it again
90:57 - yes we i think we may need to install
90:58 - the core again so
91:00 - let's go ahead and do mpmi
91:04 - uh and then to ui call yeah
91:07 - to advance for npmi bro yeah
91:10 - i'm gonna use the reverse search i use
91:14 - that a lot as well it's really handy
91:15 - if you guys don't know what that is by
91:17 - the way in the terminal so we don't
91:18 - actually remember everything we were in
91:20 - the terminal
91:21 - uh we use something called reverse
91:22 - search and it's a really handy tip
91:24 - and basically you press on a mac anyway
91:26 - you press ctrl r
91:27 - and it basically pops up like this
91:29 - little ass saw this little sort of like
91:31 - carrot and as soon as you type in it
91:33 - will basically go through the history
91:35 - and you can use the arrow keys to kind
91:36 - of go through your history
91:37 - so i use that literally religiously all
91:40 - the time so
91:41 - that saves a lot of hassle so let's go
91:43 - ahead and refresh the
91:44 - localhost 3000 i think it might be a
91:46 - refresh problem
91:50 - okay so it's saying no such file
91:52 - directory
91:54 - that is weird bro that is just not true
91:57 - i mean two ui icons
92:01 - node modules no
92:04 - do i call let me go ahead
92:07 - and actually if i comment out something
92:11 - let's go ahead and see if this fixes it
92:13 - so let me comment out the button
92:15 - and the avatar it shouldn't be because
92:17 - it should be fine
92:20 - so if i comment that out then it says it
92:22 - passing error so i don't know i don't
92:24 - want to do that
92:25 - go ahead and do this i feel like it's
92:27 - not installing it here like it's
92:29 - installing it
92:32 - okay so if i get rid of the avatar okay
92:34 - so it's something to do with that so if
92:35 - i go ahead and unscrew
92:36 - that i mean yeah it has to be installed
92:40 - because otherwise how would the camera
92:42 - icons and the other icons
92:44 - show that you built yeah no it hasn't
92:47 - stored it it has installed it it's just
92:48 - being it's just giving us some weird
92:51 - glitchy stuff right now and that always
92:53 - happens on that live
92:54 - for some reason reason but let's go
92:56 - ahead and refresh
92:58 - and see if it pops up again okay
93:01 - should be good should be good
93:05 - okay yeah so you see guys like sometimes
93:08 - it will be like that
93:09 - especially because we're doing a vs live
93:10 - share sometimes it gets cash sometimes
93:12 - it's weird headaches but
93:14 - don't get disheartened when that happens
93:15 - because like you just witness like it
93:17 - happens even to us like when that
93:19 - happens so
93:19 - it's completely normal sometimes to go
93:21 - through that and don't start
93:22 - uninstalling everything and like
93:24 - freaking out
93:25 - because uh you just sort of keep calm
93:27 - and it will fix yourself sometimes
93:29 - um right so now what we're gonna do is
93:32 - we have the music icon
93:34 - somewhere at the bottom so it's not
93:36 - actually showing it because it's not uh
93:38 - we don't actually have the positioning
93:40 - correctly yet
93:41 - but i'm going to go ahead and fix that
93:42 - in a second but the ticker right let's
93:44 - go ahead and implement the ticker and
93:46 - then we can actually go ahead and
93:47 - explain what we're doing next so
93:48 - the ticker does something very that
93:51 - basically
93:51 - the way they built this component is
93:53 - something called a higher order
93:55 - component right
93:56 - and what we can do is we can actually
93:58 - basically this is how we use it so i'll
93:59 - explain that i'm going to
94:00 - paste it in here and it will explain
94:02 - what the code is right so ticker firstly
94:04 - we need to go ahead and import it so at
94:06 - the top i'm going to go ahead and do
94:07 - that first so import ticker from react
94:08 - ticker
94:09 - like this and then to actually use it
94:12 - you see we have the parents component so
94:14 - it's ticker
94:14 - and they actually give you a property
94:16 - which is mode smooth allows it
94:18 - so as it sort of exits the screen
94:21 - then the new ticker comes on to the
94:22 - screen so that's what mode smooth does
94:24 - so that's actually in their docs
94:26 - and then here this is called um
94:29 - render props so this is something where
94:32 - when we use the ticker
94:33 - they give us something called the index
94:35 - so that will actually say like how many
94:36 - times it goes through we don't use this
94:38 - but uh we can this is how you write the
94:40 - the component itself
94:42 - um so they actually give you that so
94:43 - that's how you go ahead and pull that
94:44 - but at this point all we care about is
94:46 - what we're actually rendering so here
94:47 - it's a h1 tag which has the song
94:50 - okay so um you can use a h1 h2 h3
94:53 - in this case we're not too bothered
94:54 - about seo but you could use p tags
94:56 - if you want um but what we're going to
94:59 - go ahead and do now is i want this to
95:00 - show on the screen so i need to go to
95:01 - the video footage
95:03 - ticker i need to style it okay so i need
95:05 - to go here
95:06 - i'm going to start it so firstly i'm
95:07 - going to say go ahead
95:10 - and let me go ahead and do the following
95:12 - first so
95:14 - so the first thing i want to do is
95:15 - actually style the ticker so the ticker
95:18 - they give you an an internal class and
95:21 - it just has this as the uh
95:23 - the class name so i'm going to go ahead
95:25 - and target that
95:26 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
95:27 - going to say the height should be so i'm
95:30 - going to say the width
95:31 - is 60 the width is 60
95:34 - the margin left and margin bottoms are
95:38 - as follows so i'm going to go ahead and
95:39 - pop these in here
95:41 - like that and then what i'm going to say
95:44 - is the height should be
95:46 - enough to fit the content of what we put
95:48 - inside of it
95:49 - like this right now
95:53 - where is that ticker why is it not
95:54 - showing let me see why
95:56 - video for a ticker
95:59 - so firstly what i'm going to do is i'm
96:01 - going to go ahead and target the parent
96:02 - because we haven't actually said to the
96:04 - parent what the what the rules are yeah
96:06 - i'm going to say it's a video footer
96:08 - container which has position
96:10 - relative because it we want to be
96:12 - relative to its parent
96:14 - and then i'm going to say a bottom of
96:16 - 100 pixels
96:18 - and then i'm going to give it a margin
96:20 - left of 20 pixels so that it's not
96:22 - touching the
96:23 - the side of the screen so 20 pixels i'm
96:25 - going to save
96:27 - and now we should see
96:31 - there we go it's at the bottom you see
96:32 - that it's huge but it's at the bottom
96:36 - right so it's actually sort of scrolling
96:38 - through as a ticker so it says test song
96:40 - and it says by
96:41 - sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssanago
96:41 - which is the instagram handle
96:43 - um awesome so i want to make that look a
96:45 - bit prettier so we use the h1 inside of
96:47 - it so in order to target that
96:49 - im going to go ahead and say where we
96:52 - have the container and we have a h1
96:53 - element
96:54 - go ahead and make the font size 12 and
96:56 - the color white
96:58 - it's one size 12 color white and you'll
96:59 - see immediately that will be a lot
97:01 - smaller
97:02 - right and then i'm going to say give it
97:03 - a padding top of 7 pixels and that
97:05 - should push it down
97:06 - right so appending top of seven pixels
97:09 - and that should push it down right so we
97:12 - need to sort of style this and get the
97:13 - exact positioning
97:14 - as we need it perfectly in a sec which
97:17 - we will do
97:18 - um so there we go
97:21 - uh and now what i want to do is for the
97:23 - icon right so the icon again
97:25 - needs to know about because we're using
97:27 - absolute positioning for a lot of this
97:28 - so we need to go ahead and tell each of
97:30 - the elements that they're absolutely
97:31 - positioned so for the icon
97:32 - position absolute left should be 5
97:34 - pixels and a color of white
97:37 - so if i go ahead and do that now you can
97:38 - see we've got the ticker which is using
97:40 - up 60 percent of the width
97:42 - we have the icon which is matched to the
97:45 - left of the ticker
97:47 - and we actually have a really nice
97:48 - looking foot right so
97:50 - i know that was a bit of a digest but
97:53 - this video is recorded you can stop it
97:54 - pause it rewind it
97:56 - do whatever you want to do to go through
97:57 - that at your own pace
97:59 - and that's how you achieve that styling
98:01 - and it will be relative to wherever the
98:03 - parent is
98:04 - so as we even scroll up and down it will
98:06 - stick to
98:07 - the parent we stay relative to where the
98:09 - parent is
98:10 - which is very important point yeah now
98:14 - we the last thing that we want to do
98:16 - here is actually have the actions so the
98:19 - actions are where we have
98:20 - the favorite button the send icon the
98:22 - sort of three dots we have the
98:24 - the number of likes the number of uh
98:26 - shares that stuff so
98:28 - let's go ahead back over to video 4.js
98:30 - so let's go ahead and create a div for
98:32 - that
98:33 - so i'm going to go ahead and say div
98:36 - and i'll say the class name for this is
98:39 - going to be a video
98:40 - footer underscore underscore actions
98:44 - like this okay and then here what i'm
98:46 - going to say
98:47 - is we want to have two divs inside of
98:51 - here one for the left hand side of the
98:54 - sort of
98:54 - stuff on the screen and one for the
98:56 - right hand side of the screen right for
98:58 - the left hand side of the screen i'm
98:59 - going to do the following i'm going to
99:00 - say
99:01 - create a div with the with the following
99:05 - so
99:05 - oh god why does it do that yeah create a
99:08 - div with the following so it's got video
99:09 - footer actions left
99:11 - and i'm going to go ahead and copy that
99:13 - and i'm going to say actions right
99:15 - so you see we're just containerizing
99:16 - right so i haven't got anything inside
99:18 - of these divs yet
99:19 - but we will put some stuff in there so
99:21 - on the left side i'm going to have four
99:23 - icons
99:23 - i'm going to have the the following icon
99:25 - so this is the favorite icon this is a
99:27 - chat icon a send icon and three dots
99:30 - so i'm going to go ahead and import
99:31 - those so let me go ahead and pop those
99:34 - in at the top
99:36 - we've got the following and then i've
99:38 - got the favorite icon as well which is
99:40 - here
99:42 - right so we should see that come on to
99:45 - the screen now so you can see those four
99:47 - icons at the bottom of the screen
99:49 - and again remember we're using absolute
99:51 - positioning so we're gonna have to tell
99:52 - everything where it needs to go
99:53 - otherwise it will start to freak out
99:55 - so we will do that in a sec and then on
99:58 - the
99:58 - right side i'm going to go ahead and add
100:01 - two
100:02 - different things so on the right hand
100:04 - side we have
100:05 - a like for we have two stats right
100:08 - we have a favorite icon and then a
100:10 - number of likes we have a favorite so a
100:11 - little heart with like 300
100:13 - and then we have a little sort of share
100:16 - icon with
100:17 - um like 4 32 shares or something so i'm
100:20 - going to go ahead and do the following
100:22 - and i'll explain what this is now so
100:24 - here i've added
100:25 - two identical divs and the only thing
100:28 - i've changed
100:29 - are the icons that are being used so i'm
100:31 - here i'm using a favorite icon here i'm
100:33 - using a
100:33 - more so this is actually a share icon
100:37 - and then here i'm using the prop so this
100:39 - would be like 950 likes or something
100:41 - like that
100:42 - but remember we passed it in as a prop
100:44 - and here i'm using the shares
100:46 - okay so and i'm giving those divs
100:49 - video footer stat because it is like a
100:51 - stat it's a statistic it's like a
100:53 - favorite with
100:54 - is the number of likes and the other one
100:56 - is the number of shares
100:57 - so now that we have everything in place
101:00 - i can go ahead and i can target
101:01 - everything
101:02 - okay i can go ahead and target with this
101:04 - all so we can go ahead and make it look
101:05 - really nice
101:06 - so to get everything looking really nice
101:09 - what i'm first going to do is target
101:10 - that actions container so
101:13 - this container right here which actually
101:14 - surrounds everything
101:16 - so i'm going to go down to the bottom
101:18 - i'm going to say
101:20 - let's just add it in the middle so you
101:21 - guys can see it easier i'm going to say
101:23 - video actions here video footer actions
101:27 - and then here i'm going to say display
101:28 - flex
101:29 - so display flex and that will actually
101:32 - sort of put everything into a row
101:34 - i'm going to say position absolute so
101:36 - remember we need to tell it to be
101:37 - absolutely positioned because
101:38 - we're doing that here i'll say a width
101:40 - of 95
101:42 - width of 95 percent
101:46 - right let's go ahead and save that and
101:49 - then i'm going to say justify content
101:51 - space between and change the color of
101:53 - white
101:54 - so let's do that so this will actually
101:56 - remember we have the actions left and
101:57 - actions right so by saying space between
102:00 - i'm pushing the left container all the
102:01 - way to the left and the right container
102:03 - all the way to the right
102:04 - which is why now we see four icons on
102:06 - the left and we see the rest of the
102:07 - stuff on the right
102:09 - right remember the right side we use
102:10 - containers so it's actually done block
102:13 - right so that's why we see it like that
102:17 - okay um and now what we can do
102:20 - is um i'm gonna go ahead and actually
102:23 - target
102:24 - on the left hand side i want to give
102:26 - everything a padding
102:28 - to the left and right hand side so to go
102:30 - ahead and do that
102:31 - what i can do is i can say this
102:34 - i can say actions left which is a left
102:36 - hand container
102:38 - target the material ui icon right so
102:41 - that's the class name that they give you
102:43 - and i found that
102:44 - from actually going ahead and sort of
102:46 - inspecting
102:47 - and then we can do padding and this is a
102:49 - shorthand this is zero to the top and
102:51 - bottom
102:51 - 10 pixels to left and right and you can
102:53 - see now we've got the equal spacing so
102:54 - if i go ahead and
102:55 - comment that out uh you'll see that it
102:58 - kind of bundles the icons together as
102:59 - soon as i do that again
103:01 - it actually goes ahead and makes it a
103:02 - bit bigger okay
103:04 - so that's very clean and then on the
103:06 - right hand side
103:07 - i can do actions right display flex
103:11 - and that will actually push it into a
103:12 - row so that's nice
103:14 - but the spacing is off okay so the
103:17 - spacing is off and we want to fix that
103:18 - so right now
103:19 - the display block that's why the like is
103:22 - on top of the number
103:24 - and the share or the sort of chat is on
103:26 - the
103:27 - on top of that number so i'm going to
103:28 - say for the stat
103:31 - for the stat here i'm going to say video
103:34 - first up display flex
103:35 - a line item centrally it's looking nice
103:38 - it's clean right looking so good
103:42 - right a margin right of 10 pixels now if
103:45 - i target that p tag so you see that the
103:47 - way it's got the number next to the love
103:49 - heart and the number next to the chat
103:50 - icon it's just
103:51 - bundled too close i don't want to be
103:53 - drastic
103:54 - but i want to give it like a very small
103:56 - distance i'm going to three pixels
103:58 - margin left so i'm going to target it
103:59 - like this
104:00 - i'm going to say go ahead target the p
104:03 - tag and then give it three pixels
104:05 - it's just a very subtle difference right
104:07 - so like if i unc if i comment this out
104:09 - it's now touching and if i don't do that
104:12 - you see like a front end there's all
104:13 - subtle changes that makes it look super
104:15 - clean
104:16 - so that's three pixels of difference but
104:17 - it does make a difference to the overall
104:19 - finished product
104:20 - right so that was actually quite a
104:24 - uh quite an extensive sort of component
104:26 - that we built and actually went through
104:28 - a lot of those things
104:29 - but with that said we just went ahead
104:32 - and finished the video for
104:37 - air horns right now that's epic
104:41 - so now let's just go ahead and we're
104:44 - going to add
104:46 - the uh now we're gonna work on the
104:48 - real-time database right
104:51 - yeah okay so working on firebase
104:55 - real-time database boom
105:00 - okay cool yeah okay
105:04 - so now what we're gonna do is we're
105:05 - gonna head over to firebase
105:08 - right now we're gonna get something
105:09 - called a config file
105:12 - okay okay so how do we get the config
105:15 - file quasi
105:17 - uh we're going to go to our project
105:19 - settings
105:20 - yep whoops not there project settings
105:23 - all the way at the top
105:27 - and once we're in here we're going to
105:30 - click on that
105:31 - code should we actually register the app
105:34 - to
105:34 - or right now we need to do that in one
105:38 - yeah okay okay cool
105:39 - so guys click that like little code icon
105:42 - and then once you have that we're gonna
105:44 - just
105:44 - go ahead and do this so i'm just gonna
105:46 - call it ig reels
105:47 - we'll also do setup hosting because
105:49 - we're gonna host it later
105:51 - yep and then we're gonna go through this
105:54 - process and it's gonna give us the code
105:56 - for the config make sure you guys
105:58 - actually install
106:00 - firebase tools so run this command on
106:02 - your computer we won't have to run it
106:04 - because we've already installed it
106:06 - and uh let's continue to the console now
106:08 - here
106:09 - we need to use sudo as well guys if you
106:11 - do that come on
106:12 - that's really important what he just
106:13 - said and i will actually put that on a
106:16 - whiteboard so
106:17 - when you are installing that uh
106:21 - firebase you might actually have to do
106:23 - sudo
106:25 - you know and uh install firebase so
106:28 - keep that in mind cool
106:31 - so with that said i'm gonna copy this
106:34 - entire config by clicking here
106:36 - yep and um i'm just gonna create a file
106:40 - and i will just call it firebase.js
106:44 - and i will save all my config
106:47 - information
106:48 - in here you need to call it uh js i
106:51 - think you accidentally mistyped
106:54 - so let's go ahead and rename it and
106:57 - call it firebase.js i was wondering why
106:59 - i was looking so ugly
107:02 - right there we go awesome
107:06 - so that's that's that step guys and
107:07 - that's basically the config which is
107:09 - going to be like the key to connecting
107:10 - our front end which is the react app 2r5
107:12 - in this back end
107:13 - right now the next step is we need to
107:15 - open the terminal
107:16 - so let's hit command j
107:20 - and here what we need to do is we need
107:21 - to say mpmi
107:23 - and then i'm going to do firebase and
107:25 - this will actually go ahead and pull in
107:26 - all the firebase dependencies into the
107:28 - project so that we can actually go ahead
107:30 - and use it
107:31 - so while it does that we can actually go
107:33 - ahead and carry on coding so at the top
107:35 - of the
107:35 - top of this file i'm going to import
107:37 - firebase from firebase
107:39 - and then i have literally a two magic
107:42 - lines of code which do a lot of hard
107:43 - work under the scenes right behind the
107:45 - scenes so
107:46 - these two lines of code pretty much go
107:48 - ahead and do the job of connecting
107:50 - everything
107:50 - so i don't think they can see it so
107:53 - because let's actually drop the terminal
107:55 - so
107:55 - that will actually go ahead and install
107:57 - firebase we do command j
107:59 - yep yeah now underneath here guys what
108:02 - we have
108:02 - is we have this one line of codes which
108:05 - says
108:06 - firebase dot initialize app
108:09 - and then we pass in the firebase config
108:11 - right
108:12 - so this what this is doing is it's using
108:14 - the firebase that we imported at the top
108:16 - and it's saying initialize the app by
108:18 - using the object with our basically our
108:20 - credentials right
108:22 - so we can go ahead and do that and
108:23 - remember these are completely safe to
108:25 - share which is why we're not hiding them
108:26 - because they're public
108:27 - credentials and then here what we're
108:29 - going to say is const db
108:31 - equals firebase app firestore so this is
108:34 - the app that we just initialized this
108:35 - one right here we're saying access the
108:37 - database
108:38 - and just put it inside of this variable
108:40 - now i want to use the database in
108:42 - external files
108:43 - so basically to finish this file up all
108:45 - i say is export default db
108:47 - and that is i actually found something
108:50 - that's pretty amazing so i'm going to
108:51 - share this right now
108:53 - but said the following he said
108:57 - although i'm not understanding i keep
109:00 - being present
109:01 - in for all of the classes you make for
109:03 - us i'm sure
109:05 - one day we shall be those who let you
109:07 - rest and become
109:08 - our turn thanks clever programmers
109:10 - basically saying hopefully i can
109:12 - actually
109:13 - like i join it even if i'm not
109:15 - understanding i'm around
109:17 - now here is what makes it truly great
109:20 - the greatest ever i mean you can't be
109:23 - great without
109:23 - the greatest ever and he says mahad
109:26 - kumar
109:27 - he goes babies learn by observation i
109:30 - will say it again
109:31 - babies learn by observation and then
109:33 - learn
109:34 - more in those years than almost ever
109:38 - any time after so know that you are
109:40 - learning
109:42 - guys if you feel like instead of
109:44 - watching netflix you're watching this
109:46 - and you are thinking even if i'm not
109:49 - building the clones with them am i
109:50 - really learning
109:51 - the truth of the matter is even
109:55 - times if you're not speaking a language
109:56 - like when i go when i went to colombia
109:58 - even when i wasn't speaking spanish that
110:00 - much
110:01 - i was picking it up so much that even
110:04 - sometimes now i'll say words and frankie
110:07 - you can speak perfect spanish right but
110:09 - like you this guy's surprised oftentimes
110:11 - and he's like
110:12 - yo how are you saying all those words
110:15 - right
110:15 - all the time so that's what will happen
110:18 - with you where you will be able to pick
110:19 - up or react
110:21 - and have pattern recognition with
110:22 - javascript simply because you
110:25 - are just using it so much so just
110:27 - remember that i think that's
110:29 - huge exactly guys uh
110:32 - and that's it it's all about pattern
110:34 - recognition and just like the more you
110:36 - see these things the more you sort of
110:37 - get exposed to it
110:39 - the more it's going to digest and be
110:41 - inside
110:42 - and sort of be easier for you to pick up
110:44 - in the future as well so just by being
110:46 - here even if it doesn't make sense
110:47 - is making a huge development on your
110:49 - development
110:51 - awesome nice
110:55 - so with that said we are going to we
110:58 - just
110:58 - finished setting up the firebase oh no
111:01 - what happened i love this comment while
111:04 - we figured out what went wrong but
111:07 - william
111:08 - says clever programmer is disrupting
111:10 - traditional learning in a big way
111:13 - i'm a senior golang engineer and was
111:16 - getting started with react on a personal
111:18 - project
111:18 - thank you hey that is amazing
111:22 - i love that i love that dude so my
111:25 - firebase
111:25 - so my firebase js only says it has the
111:28 - config inside of it but you have the
111:29 - actual true file so
111:31 - on your firebase js what do you have
111:34 - okay so you have everything in there
111:36 - okay that's fine i just hit save as well
111:39 - okay we're all good then so we've done
111:42 - the firebase js setup so we have
111:43 - everything set up now
111:44 - so what we need to do next is actually
111:46 - go ahead and so i need to reconnect to
111:48 - the session
111:49 - okay so one sec do it yeah
111:52 - so guys one thing i want to say is just
111:55 - by the way just cut me off whenever
111:56 - you're ready sonny
111:57 - and yeah okay it seems like you're good
111:59 - but this db over here this is what we're
112:02 - gonna be just passing around in our
112:03 - entire app and
112:05 - literally gives us access to the
112:06 - firebase database
112:08 - just that variable right there so that's
112:10 - what you're gonna that's this is why
112:11 - we're exporting it here
112:12 - so then we can use it in our different
112:14 - components of the app
112:16 - exactly exactly and it really is a
112:18 - powerful
112:19 - uh asset when you have that little db
112:21 - because it just makes it so easy to
112:23 - access
112:24 - push listen to the database you can do a
112:26 - lot of powerful stuff now
112:28 - so with that said what we're going to do
112:29 - is go over to firebase
112:32 - on the right-hand side and we're going
112:35 - to go ahead and initialize
112:36 - our firestore database okay so let's go
112:40 - to firebase
112:42 - yep yep and then we're gonna go to
112:45 - database
112:46 - what i keep realizing sunny is i keep
112:48 - leaning in
112:49 - too much yeah because i wanna actually
112:52 - like speak and sound better
112:54 - but that's like hurting my neck like
112:56 - crazy because i'm looking at a giant
112:58 - tv oh yeah because for those of you guys
113:01 - that don't know i have this like giant
113:03 - tv that i have set up
113:04 - so yeah it's it like kills my neck so i
113:07 - have to be here which might make my
113:09 - audio quality sound bad but i have to be
113:11 - actually here
113:12 - to be super comfortable and view
113:14 - everything
113:15 - so i think i'm going to get one of those
113:16 - like boom arm yes
113:18 - i was going to say get boom yeah yeah
113:20 - because otherwise i'm going to
113:22 - like lose my neck through this even for
113:24 - this
113:25 - even for this setup i'd say get a
113:26 - condenser mic
113:28 - which is actually like a points towards
113:30 - you and that might be better yeah
113:32 - that's true uh but yeah actually frankie
113:35 - i brought the condenser mic that we got
113:37 - at one time
113:38 - we went to a convention so we can
113:40 - actually pop that up
113:42 - so we'll we'll do that so now we're on
113:44 - firebase we're going to hit create
113:46 - database and here make sure you
113:47 - choose start in test mode hit done and
113:50 - then just
113:51 - choose done it doesn't matter what
113:52 - location it picks it's going to be a
113:54 - good location by default
113:57 - damn i see it's our stream is like
114:00 - starting to peak again and we're getting
114:01 - more
114:02 - viewers and thank you guys so much we
114:04 - are currently at
114:05 - 330 and we broke sixteen thousand views
114:08 - so thank you guys and if you're enjoying
114:10 - this so far
114:11 - make sure you hit the like button so it
114:13 - goes out to more people
114:15 - exactly guys we ask is you smash that
114:18 - thumbs up
114:20 - nice so with that said now we're inside
114:23 - the database so the database follows a
114:25 - collection document collection document
114:27 - and repeating structure right
114:29 - a collection is simply a list it's like
114:30 - an array right so
114:32 - let's go ahead and start that um
114:36 - with that collection by going ahead and
114:38 - creating a collection of rules
114:40 - right so let's go ahead and say rules
114:42 - yep so this is going to be where
114:43 - the videos are so reels and we'll hit
114:46 - next
114:48 - auto yeah so this is actually going to
114:51 - be the first rule
114:52 - so in order to understand what fields we
114:54 - need
114:55 - what we're going to do is we're actually
114:56 - going to yeah let's go to app.js
115:00 - let's go to apps and let's use the
115:02 - app.js props that we
115:04 - actually let's use video card props and
115:06 - i'm just gonna
115:07 - i will show that in just a second but
115:10 - the things that we're gonna be using
115:11 - here
115:12 - for the video um the fields
115:15 - what fields are we gonna need so i can
115:16 - visually show it here and then we can
115:18 - show it through props
115:19 - so i imagine go ahead okay so channel of
115:24 - so the channel that's right here yep
115:27 - that channel
115:27 - sanga got it what else and then we're
115:30 - gonna have the avatar
115:32 - source so the avatar image and that's
115:34 - the image yep
115:36 - yep we have the song that's playing okay
115:39 - so that's what
115:40 - brings the ticker yeah exactly and we
115:43 - have the url of the actual video
115:46 - itself okay otherwise the video would
115:48 - not be here at
115:49 - all yep got it and then we have the
115:52 - number of likes and the number of shares
115:54 - in the bottom right
115:55 - okay so those are all the things that
115:58 - we're going to need to feed our database
115:59 - when we create
116:00 - a dummy we're going to basically create
116:02 - this
116:03 - through the database got it and then
116:07 - props let's look at app.js quickly
116:10 - before we do that
116:11 - so okay yes there we go and you can see
116:13 - here guys we have the props right
116:16 - so here we're manually passing in those
116:18 - props we've got the channel so when you
116:19 - say
116:19 - okay got it yeah i was just gonna say if
116:21 - you could just say what the props are
116:23 - but here the channel is a prop
116:25 - the avatar source is a prop and video
116:27 - card is the component
116:29 - yes exactly so rather than hard coding
116:32 - these values like we're doing here
116:34 - we want to be able to pull them from the
116:36 - database so let's go ahead and add a
116:37 - document which fits this structure
116:40 - so for the first field let's go ahead
116:41 - and do a field of channel
116:44 - got it okay so yeah so basically we're
116:46 - going to go channel
116:47 - and boom and i will also post the same
116:50 - values
116:51 - avatar source and all of this is string
116:54 - because i actually see that he has a
116:55 - string data type there so i'm just going
116:57 - to keep it as a string
116:59 - song this is also a string
117:04 - url is going to be actually let's go
117:07 - so this is going to be a url which is
117:10 - the video url
117:11 - right yep cool so i'm going to paste
117:14 - that here
117:15 - likes are going to be a number so i'm
117:18 - going to say likes
117:19 - we're going to make it a number we're
117:21 - going to give it just 950 likes
117:23 - and then shares is also going to be a
117:26 - number so i'm going to go ahead
117:28 - boom boom boom uh whoops and
117:31 - i'm going to just copy this and paste it
117:34 - awesome so that record is now made and i
117:37 - just want to show you guys when sunny
117:38 - was talking about how the structure is
117:41 - so here you got your you got your
117:44 - collections inside of the collections
117:47 - you have documents so for example
117:49 - hey basically in english i'm saying hey
117:51 - this this is where all my reels are
117:54 - this is a folder that has all my reels
117:56 - then when you go inside of that folder
117:58 - that literally has like all of your
118:00 - reels right
118:02 - and then it's like so in your actual
118:04 - local computer you would have a folder
118:06 - called photos
118:07 - and then inside of there you might have
118:08 - like all your photos so just like that
118:10 - we have all the reels here
118:12 - now once we go inside of a particular
118:16 - reel all the data associated with that
118:19 - is right over
118:20 - here so what does that data mean for
118:21 - example
118:23 - hey here's the url for that so i'm going
118:25 - to copy this url
118:26 - we're going to open a new tab press and
118:29 - type it in
118:30 - and then boom this is what actually
118:32 - comes up
118:34 - yeah yeah so this is
118:37 - you know the data that's part of it
118:40 - exactly so a really nice explanation
118:43 - there guys and like you can now see the
118:45 - exact way that we've
118:47 - mapped the uh sort of the props that we
118:49 - were previously passing as hard-coded
118:51 - values
118:52 - into the database so that we have the
118:53 - same structure right
118:56 - now with that said we now need to pull
118:58 - that information from the database so
119:00 - we're going to show you a really nice
119:02 - way of doing this
119:03 - and also the added bonus here is that
119:05 - you actually go ahead and get
119:07 - a real-time function you get real-time
119:09 - functionality here as well so
119:11 - the first step to this is we need a sort
119:13 - of variable to keep track of all of the
119:15 - real
119:16 - all of the rails right so let's go ahead
119:18 - and create one so remember in react
119:20 - to create a variable we use use state
119:23 - so we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and
119:25 - say const and we say rules
119:27 - and we're gonna say set rules right and
119:29 - then we say use
119:30 - state and then the initial value here is
119:33 - going to be an empty array because we're
119:34 - going to assume that we have
119:35 - zero rules by default when we begin this
119:38 - process
119:39 - yeah so we're going to do this and we
119:41 - need to import use state at the top okay
119:43 - so like this now what we're going to do
119:47 - is we are going to go ahead and actually
119:50 - add a
119:51 - use effect now i'll explain what a use
119:53 - effect is and it's basically going to
119:55 - allow us to run a piece of code
119:57 - when the app component loads and we want
119:59 - to run this once
120:00 - because we just need to set up a
120:01 - listener to the database one time
120:04 - and we don't want to keep firing off we
120:05 - just want it to happen once right
120:07 - so we've gone ahead and imported it and
120:09 - in order to write a use effect we write
120:11 - it over here so we say
120:12 - use effect right and then what happens
120:15 - is it takes a function
120:17 - so it takes a function and then it takes
120:18 - a second argument which is the
120:20 - dependencies
120:21 - so by default by passing mt dependencies
120:24 - like this
120:25 - what this is saying is that the app
120:28 - component
120:29 - will run once when it loads
120:33 - and never again right so it won't run
120:36 - once when it loads and it won't run
120:37 - again
120:38 - but if i had like for example a comp a
120:42 - like a a variable inside of here like
120:44 - name or like age or something like that
120:47 - whenever these it will run once when
120:49 - when it loads it will also run
120:51 - when name and age change which is why
120:54 - it's known as a dependency
120:56 - okay so if we by default right now we
120:58 - just want to run once when it loads so
121:00 - we're going to basically go ahead and do
121:01 - this
121:03 - so what we now need to do is import that
121:05 - db
121:06 - from our local firebase file so here we
121:08 - do import db from our local firebase not
121:10 - the
121:11 - module firebase and then we're going to
121:13 - go ahead and do db
121:15 - dot collection because remember that
121:17 - collection that we created on firebase
121:20 - was reals okay so we actually had a
121:23 - collection called rules
121:24 - and then what we say is on snapshot so
121:27 - this is the magic right here so on
121:29 - snapshot is saying
121:30 - go ahead and give me like imagine you've
121:32 - got a camera and you pretty much take a
121:34 - picture of that rails collection
121:36 - so that that list of remember cause he
121:38 - said it was like a
121:39 - a folder right with all the rules inside
121:41 - of it so imagine we could take a picture
121:43 - of that folder at that exact point in
121:44 - time
121:45 - so that's the snapshot right
121:49 - that's the snapshot now the the
121:51 - beautiful thing here
121:52 - is that the snapshot whenever something
121:55 - is added whenever something is changed
121:57 - whenever something is removed the
121:59 - snapshot is refired off
122:01 - and we get a fresh snapshot right so you
122:04 - get a fresh snapshot
122:06 - and then that goes ahead and gives us
122:08 - the most up-to-date value of
122:09 - what the reals folder or collection
122:12 - looks like
122:13 - okay yep so and i just wanna and i'll
122:16 - keep visually adding
122:18 - like more technically what he's
122:20 - accessing
122:21 - so when he's saying hey give me the
122:23 - reels folder
122:25 - i mean that's how i think in english you
122:27 - know if you
122:28 - like give me the reals folder boom
122:30 - that's what's giving him
122:32 - and then on snapshot is just a fancy way
122:35 - of getting everything in real time yep
122:38 - exactly exactly that guys fancy way of
122:41 - getting everything in row time
122:43 - so now what we're going to do is go
122:45 - ahead and actually
122:47 - um set the rules
122:51 - so we're gonna set the rules to a value
122:53 - right and what value are we gonna set
122:54 - the rows to
122:55 - i basically want to go through all of
122:57 - the rows inside the database
122:58 - so here's set rows i'm going to go
123:00 - through all of them so i'm going to say
123:01 - snapshot
123:02 - dot docs so that's going to go ahead and
123:04 - go through that list of rules
123:05 - right snapshot.docs and then i'm going
123:08 - to say map so iterate through every
123:10 - single one
123:11 - so snapshot.docs returns like this
123:14 - returns an array yep okay
123:17 - so this guys is basically
123:20 - everything inside of here exactly
123:25 - and then the dot map thing will allow
123:28 - you to actually like
123:29 - loop through one by one so like if this
123:32 - is the first item
123:33 - and this will be the second reel and the
123:35 - third reel and a fourth reel
123:37 - all that exactly that we want to
123:40 - basically map
123:41 - through them and basically return it in
123:43 - a structure that is good for us
123:45 - right so in this case what i'm going to
123:46 - say is map through every single document
123:49 - and basically go ahead and get the
123:51 - doc.data
123:53 - right and the doc.data is all of the
123:56 - properties associated to that one
123:58 - document so the
123:59 - world wars okay got it yes couldn't see
124:02 - some of it so now we could see it
124:04 - yeah okay so basically go ahead go ahead
124:07 - finish your thing
124:08 - uh so all of these so if you have doctor
124:10 - data so the avatar source the channel
124:12 - like share song url anything associated
124:15 - with that document that we're
124:16 - mapping through or iterating through it
124:19 - we're gonna get that information
124:21 - back so i'm just gonna again visualize
124:23 - everything he's saying because this is
124:25 - where it gets really dense
124:27 - and i just want to empathize for
124:28 - everybody who's watching because
124:30 - it always would kill me when i would be
124:32 - going through this
124:33 - so reels gets you this all right
124:37 - then when we do snapshot.docs that gets
124:40 - us
124:40 - everything here yep
124:43 - then when we do dot map then each dock
124:46 - here allows us to loop through it
124:49 - okay and then when we do doc dot data
124:53 - it gets you so when you're looping
124:55 - through it gets you this particular dock
124:56 - in the first loop
124:58 - and then all the data here and then this
125:01 - data here
125:02 - is actually uh at object
125:07 - yes it's just filled with key value
125:09 - pairs yeah
125:10 - exactly so you end up getting as it maps
125:13 - through everything you end up getting an
125:14 - array
125:15 - of objects and then that goes inside of
125:17 - our rails variable
125:19 - yep so the the final thing that you're
125:21 - going to get is an array of
125:23 - objects so for example here's your first
125:28 - reel and this is going to have
125:31 - does this this also has an id right uh
125:34 - no so we're just pulling the data not
125:36 - the ids yeah okay
125:38 - so we're not pulling okay cool so the
125:40 - first reel
125:41 - is essentially gonna have for example
125:44 - you know
125:44 - channel i'll just put channel for now as
125:46 - clever quasi
125:48 - okay yeah and then a bunch of other
125:51 - stuff
125:52 - um yeah and then the second one doesn't
125:54 - exist yet so this entire thing
125:56 - right now would look like this for you
125:58 - know again this is just an example but
126:00 - this is what it would look like
126:01 - an array with one item exactly
126:04 - and then as you add the second third
126:06 - document you would get an array with two
126:07 - items three items
126:08 - etc all right so nice
126:12 - awesome logan just dropped by he goes
126:14 - hey guys in office today just wanted to
126:16 - stop in and support you
126:17 - thank you so much and then he says the
126:20 - drawing is helpful
126:21 - hopefully this is helpful for you guys
126:24 - nice
126:24 - awesome um right
126:28 - so now what we're going to do is reels
126:32 - we'll now actually if we've done
126:33 - everything correctly we'll have all of
126:34 - the information that we want
126:36 - right so this is the moment of truth now
126:38 - so
126:39 - what we're going to do is we're going to
126:40 - go down here we're going to delete this
126:41 - line
126:42 - and what i'm going to do is rather than
126:43 - having this hard-coded out like this
126:45 - right so rather than having all of this
126:47 - stuff
126:47 - hard-coded at the bottom so we have like
126:49 - all of these
126:51 - uh video cards so let's go ahead and
126:53 - remove these we have
126:54 - this video card this video kind of when
126:55 - you get rid of that get rid of and
126:57 - instead of doing this what we have right
126:59 - now
127:00 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to say
127:02 - so i'm going to do some java jsx
127:04 - so i'm going to go ahead and do this i'm
127:06 - going to say
127:09 - reals.map right and for every single
127:12 - reel
127:13 - i want to return a video card right so i
127:16 - want to return a video card so i want to
127:17 - return
127:18 - a video card like this right but
127:22 - look what we do here that's different
127:23 - right so i don't want these values to be
127:24 - hard coded
127:26 - i actually want to pull the values from
127:28 - it so here
127:29 - we can destructure the real so i can
127:31 - actually go ahead and pull the rail
127:33 - apart and say get
127:34 - me the channel the avatar the song the
127:37 - url the likes etc from that row so i can
127:39 - go ahead and do this
127:41 - i can actually pull it apart and i can
127:43 - do that
127:44 - right now what i can say is
127:48 - rose dot map uh yep so i don't know why
127:51 - it's freaking out yep so rose i'm not in
127:52 - the video card component
127:54 - like this now here i can actually go
127:56 - ahead and say this should be the channel
127:58 - that we're getting back from the db this
128:00 - should be the avatar
128:03 - source the avatar
128:06 - source this should be the song
128:10 - and these are mapping to the database
128:12 - this should be the url from the database
128:14 - so it should be the url this should be
128:16 - the likes
128:18 - and this should be the shares like that
128:20 - and what i can do now is i can get rid
128:22 - of our hard-coded value
128:24 - so i can actually go ahead and highlight
128:25 - a hardcore value and delete
128:27 - our hard-coded one so at this point in
128:29 - time guys
128:30 - we have no hard-coded stuff here so you
128:32 - can actually see for yourself
128:34 - there is no hard-coded stuff saying that
128:37 - this me
128:38 - like this is the channel name or blah
128:39 - blah blah we're mapping it from the db
128:42 - okay and what we can actually do to
128:44 - prove this is we can go ahead and save
128:46 - and we can go back to our app and we can
128:49 - if everything was done correctly
128:51 - this should map to the database it
128:53 - should listen it should
128:54 - get all that information and it should
128:56 - render out the video card correctly on
128:57 - the screen
128:59 - and if it does i think we deserve a
129:00 - thumbs up so let's go back to localhost
129:04 - all right let's check it out and
129:07 - i'll find out if you're bullshitting us
129:09 - sonny i'll find out
129:14 - wait here we go hold on hold on first we
129:16 - gotta put it through the stress
129:18 - test guys could be bullshitting us so we
129:20 - gotta find out
129:22 - let's see here okay
129:25 - [Music]
129:28 - so it says 950 here yeah yep
129:32 - now if it's true what you're saying if i
129:35 - change this it should change here in
129:37 - real time without me refreshing or doing
129:39 - anything right
129:41 - which is insane but let's try it
129:44 - yep okay so let's give it a try i'm
129:46 - going to change this to
129:49 - 154 and i'm going to hit update
129:52 - holy crap dude
129:59 - real time guys real real time okay let
130:02 - me try let me try this
130:04 - clever quasi to um pop up python
130:09 - bro wow this is real time i love this
130:13 - you know that it's always satisfying
130:15 - whenever
130:16 - i see that rea like firebase connect
130:19 - with react and then work in real time
130:22 - it's just always like one of the best
130:24 - feelings
130:25 - yeah it's crazy and it's just insane
130:27 - like how little code
130:29 - it was to get that powerful
130:31 - functionality like there was no managing
130:33 - sockets there was no socket i o there
130:35 - was no headache or anything
130:36 - we just did a simple like three lines of
130:38 - code with the on snapshot
130:40 - and it just worked right everything
130:42 - worked and then it was paired
130:43 - beautifully with the react hooks
130:45 - everything worked really really nice
130:47 - that's amazing
130:49 - what we're going to do now is if you can
130:50 - see on the right we can't actually
130:52 - scroll
130:53 - right so let's go back to having that
130:54 - layout quasi
130:56 - yeah i can't scroll i'm trying to scroll
130:58 - i can't yeah
130:59 - so now let's have firebase on the left
131:01 - and let's go ahead and add a
131:03 - another um document into firebase so i'm
131:06 - going to go ahead and i'm actually going
131:08 - to drop you some content
131:10 - so i'm going to go ahead and drop you an
131:12 - avatar source
131:15 - so i will drop it inside of where should
131:17 - i drop
131:18 - it i could drop it inside of app.js sure
131:21 - go for it
131:22 - yeah so i'll drop this one into app.json
131:25 - boom
131:26 - that's the source um
131:29 - and add it you want me to add this to
131:31 - the database yes yeah
131:34 - okay that's avatar source um
131:37 - i wish it would just allow me to
131:38 - duplicate a record you know that'd be
131:40 - nice
131:41 - i know yeah
131:44 - so that's avatar source this is the
131:47 - handle
131:48 - so and the channel name is uh sanga
131:50 - right
131:51 - yep cool and then avatar
131:56 - uh okay url you gave me the video url
131:59 - right
132:00 - no that's actually the avatar a source i
132:02 - gave you
132:03 - the instagram long the first thing that
132:05 - you gave me was the avatar source
132:08 - yeah okay got it what else
132:11 - and then likes on like we just do likes
132:14 - at 9 50 or something
132:17 - and then do shares around like 40 or
132:20 - something
132:21 - okay i'm gonna do 47 and then
132:25 - a song let's do this this was the song
132:27 - that i used
132:28 - this one here i'm gonna use don't rush
132:32 - hey there it is oh nice you actually
132:35 - oh that's funny dude why why don't you
132:38 - ever put
132:38 - um apostrophes like do you don't like
132:41 - them or
132:42 - to piss you off or what
132:45 - for what bit like don't you never put a
132:48 - pasta i notice you don't put it in don't
132:49 - you don't put it in let's is it like a
132:51 - british thing or is it just like a you
132:53 - personal thing
132:54 - i don't know i mean i do it for the s's
132:57 - but for everything else i get lazy
132:58 - yeah okay okay i see i got it and then
133:01 - for the url
133:02 - we have this huge one so this so this is
133:04 - going to be a number right likes and
133:06 - shares are going to be a number so yeah
133:08 - let me actually fix those real quick all
133:10 - right go for it
133:11 - now what url this is the big one so this

136:11 - new thing throughout this entire video
136:13 - all we ask is that you smash the thumbs
136:15 - up button yo frankie come tell them to
136:18 - smash that thumbs up button bro we need
136:19 - you
136:21 - we we need that we haven't even broke a
136:24 - thousand on this one man what's the
136:25 - point of these streams right here guys
136:27 - what is up
136:28 - we need 75 more likes to get to 900 but
136:31 - we really want to get to 1000 so
136:33 - smash that like button hey you guys are

136:37 - you guys are enjoying cindy and kazi
136:38 - i'll leave you now
136:40 - hey right here bro all right here we go
136:44 - so somebody said hey ma
136:48 - tell him to mute this part of the stream
136:51 - later
136:52 - uh he's playing copyrighted music here's
136:55 - the thing
136:55 - yeah it's called the fair use act by
136:58 - youtube if you're doing it for under a
137:01 - certain amount of time so in this case
137:02 - under 15 seconds
137:05 - you are fine and then the fair use act
137:07 - basically says
137:08 - if we're not showing like if our entire
137:11 - piece of content isn't about their music
137:14 - and we're just using it as a purpose to
137:16 - like demonstrate a point or whatever
137:18 - then that is actually completely okay so
137:21 - we are protected by the youtube
137:23 - uh fair uh policy
137:27 - fair use i think if you're i think if
137:28 - you're actually talking over it as well
137:30 - it actually
137:31 - counts as a fair use yeah yeah so
137:34 - there it is you guys the app is pretty
137:37 - much ready to go now we're about to
137:38 - deploy it
137:39 - to firebase let's do this thing all
137:42 - right
137:43 - so let me go ahead and put this over
137:45 - here and we're going to open up
137:49 - our command line yep
137:52 - now guys before you do this you guys
137:55 - will need to do a command called
137:57 - firebase
137:58 - login and that will log into your uh
138:00 - that log firebase into your your gmail
138:02 - account right
138:02 - yeah if you do if you do it cause it
138:04 - will just say it will say currently
138:05 - logged in as cleverkarzi
138:07 - so we can go ahead and do that so i'm
138:09 - going to show you guys firebase
138:11 - login right now it's on localhost so you
138:14 - guys can see that
138:15 - so i'm logged in right now and then the
138:17 - next step we're going to do is firebase
138:19 - in it
138:20 - exactly okay
138:25 - and then we're gonna go to hosting
138:28 - so we're gonna choose that and hit enter
138:32 - after you're done choosing hosting click
138:34 - use an existing project so i'm gonna hit
138:36 - enter here
138:37 - and we are going to go all the way down
138:39 - to ig reels
138:41 - hit enter now here instead of public
138:44 - make sure you say build
138:45 - now here say y as in yes
138:49 - hit enter those are the important bits
138:52 - and with that said we are ready to
138:55 - deploy this app
138:56 - hopefully you guys are pumped no yeah no
138:59 - yeah no yeah no yeah no yeah
139:00 - we have the npm run build oh yeah yeah
139:03 - my bad npm run build good looks
139:06 - so here is the folder guys so let me
139:08 - actually show you guys where it's gonna
139:09 - put it
139:10 - so there's a build folder here but it's
139:12 - kind of empty right now yeah
139:13 - now when i hit and i'm picking up your
139:16 - british yeah
139:17 - but it's okay it's it's fun
139:20 - and it's going to put it in here right
139:23 - there
139:23 - you guys saw it happen and this is all
139:26 - the stuff that actually goes online so
139:28 - when we host it
139:29 - this is everything that goes online
139:34 - i know greatest ever has a question
139:35 - about this he says when you change
139:37 - things after deploying locally what
139:38 - happens to firebase i need to overwrite
139:40 - my previous deployed site
139:42 - because my current one looks better and
139:43 - i need that one online
139:45 - so all of your stuff is going to be in
139:47 - build make sure it's in here and then
139:49 - deploy it
139:52 - yep exactly and when you do npm run
139:54 - build guys
139:55 - very important to know two things one is
139:57 - creating an optimizer production build
139:59 - so it strips out all the developer stuff
140:00 - which means it makes a super lightweight
140:02 - build
140:03 - which is what we want when we deploy the
140:05 - app that's the first point
140:06 - the second point is when you do this
140:09 - command
140:10 - remember if you make any changes
140:12 - afterwards
140:13 - right you have to do npm run build
140:15 - before you do the deployment again right
140:17 - so you make sure if you do any code
140:19 - changes after you run this
140:20 - you need to run npm run build again to
140:23 - make sure that that is also bundled in
140:25 - with that optimized build
140:27 - yes otherwise it won't be a part of the
140:28 - build building you might think like oh
140:30 - what's going on and i ran into that when
140:31 - i started off so
140:32 - don't fall prone to that era exactly
140:36 - so just watch out for that now we're
140:38 - ready to deploy it
140:40 - all right i'm going to hit firebase
140:41 - deploy now are you guys ready drop it
140:44 - down below
140:45 - and we're going to deploy this and it
140:47 - should be up in about

146:34 - course or like other paid course out
146:36 - there in our course guys it's
146:38 - it's not a course it's it's a community
146:40 - that you're joining right
146:41 - so you have training modules that you
146:43 - can take at your own pace we have
146:44 - weekly coaching calls so like every
146:46 - single week we run around
146:48 - four weekly coaching goals whatever
146:49 - that's actually one of the most
146:51 - valuable things about this program where
146:53 - students often say it's worth
146:54 - more than a coding boot camp exactly
146:58 - every tuesday i will teach react
147:00 - coaching calls and we had frank jump on
147:02 - earlier and actually vouch for that and
147:03 - he
147:04 - really is a developer who had tons of
147:06 - experience before
147:07 - and even he found value in it guys so
147:09 - honestly we highly recommend that you
147:11 - just
147:11 - even if we got 30 day money back
147:13 - guarantee you can join and see how it is
147:15 - for 30 days
147:16 - that means you have pretty much
147:17 - potentially free coaching calls that you
147:20 - guys cannot like literally i wouldn't
147:21 - miss out on that opportunity if you're
147:23 - looking to build your skill set
147:25 - we have success coaches who will give
147:26 - you personalized video feedback
147:28 - like i'll repeat that personalize the
147:30 - video feedback on your homework guys
147:32 - which is insane right and here are the
147:35 - success coaches that we're talking about
147:37 - right so we just
147:38 - mentioned the success coach and as a
147:40 - matter of fact
147:41 - our success coaches so here's an example
147:44 - of jen who's our success coach
147:46 - and she is actually hosting the a
147:49 - success coach so our success coaches
147:51 - will even host
147:52 - extra live coaching calls for you guys
147:55 - and uh our community is just buzzing we
147:58 - just have we have over 1422 members just
148:01 - in our slack community
148:03 - and if we click over here in the people
148:06 - section
148:07 - you guys can see that our community is
148:09 - buzzing with energy
148:10 - and amazing human beings inside of this
148:13 - program
148:14 - exactly and kazi how many students have
148:16 - we got in the community right now
148:18 - um probably over like 16 or 1700 at this
148:21 - point
148:22 - it's insane right yeah yeah it's really
148:25 - insane and guys when i mean like
148:27 - the amount of time and the thing is guys
148:29 - i really want to stress here that
148:30 - it's a case of you can just message all
148:33 - of us
148:34 - right so that you can message us you can
148:35 - jump on a call with me if you're stuck
148:37 - on something
148:38 - uh the amount of times i jump on calls
148:40 - with students just because they're stuck
148:41 - on something they need to overcome a
148:42 - problem
148:43 - you won't get that in other sort of if
148:45 - you try and message udemy
148:47 - coach right you'll never get access to
148:49 - them yeah you'll never get an accident
148:51 - you never
148:51 - we literally get on calls with people
148:53 - like one-on-one calls with people
148:55 - and like allow you to access this even
148:57 - through text messaging david racos used
149:00 - one of our success coaches says
149:01 - the course basically pays for itself
149:04 - which has been true for him as soon as
149:05 - he joined he was able to pay off the
149:07 - course
149:08 - through what he learned and then ola
149:10 - kunli
149:11 - who comes to these live streams is here
149:13 - right now
149:14 - he ended up joining prophet javascript
149:15 - he says the weekly coaching
149:17 - is the meat of profit with javascript so
149:22 - i really think that's where we bring a
149:24 - ton of value
149:26 - to you guys exactly guys and guys we
149:29 - just don't take we don't stop there
149:31 - right
149:31 - we teach you how to take all of those
149:33 - skills and then
149:35 - teach you the methods of how you can
149:37 - start generating an
149:39 - income with those skills right because i
149:42 - think this is the most important at the
149:43 - end of the day which is something i
149:44 - think most people don't teach right most
149:46 - people will have
149:47 - like let's say the training part down
149:49 - and then that's kind of it
149:51 - or they'll have like one or the other or
149:53 - some people just might have a really
149:54 - great community
149:56 - but we have and then boot camps what's
149:58 - great about boot camps is they have like
150:00 - these
150:01 - interactive calls what's cool about us
150:03 - is we got the training for you
150:05 - we got the calls we got an amazing
150:07 - community
150:08 - right and then we also make sure that
150:10 - you go out and actually make a living

151:08 - program now one thing i do want to let
151:10 - you guys know
151:11 - is in probably the next two weeks or
151:13 - less
151:14 - we are going to be increasing the price
151:17 - of the program
151:18 - permanently so whatever price you're
151:20 - getting is a steal
151:21 - we know this program is worth like three
151:23 - to five thousand dollars
151:25 - and we are starting to price it higher
151:27 - and higher so we can actually get it to
151:29 - that boot camp level
151:31 - but other outside of that like our main
151:35 - thing that we do on youtube is provide
151:37 - you as much value as we possibly can
151:40 - then in this program is where you and i
151:42 - can engage with each other where sonny
151:44 - and you can
151:45 - engage with each other in zoom calls
151:47 - where you can speak to him
151:48 - and everybody else directly exactly
151:52 - exactly guys and it really does make all
151:54 - the difference when you have
151:56 - that mentor that you can actually go and
151:58 - speak with and communicate with on like
152:00 - a zoom core
152:01 - it's a lot more personal than just a
152:03 - little message
152:04 - on sort of udemy that you're never going
152:05 - to get a response back from so
