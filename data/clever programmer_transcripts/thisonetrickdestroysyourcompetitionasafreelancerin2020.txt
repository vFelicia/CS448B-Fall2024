00:00 - now moving on talk to us about like
00:02 - personalize
00:04 - your messages okay so
00:07 - this is um this is where we met causey
00:11 - oh this is actually holy crap this is
00:14 - actually your real message to me the
00:16 - first one
00:17 - actual first one yep yep there was a
00:20 - kind of um
00:20 - a little proposal that goes with it but
00:22 - this was the cover letter so this is
00:23 - what i sent to try and
00:24 - stand out when i saw your your the job
00:26 - application and now you've been working
00:28 - with us for what
00:30 - two point uh first
00:33 - ever message uh and now this is so
00:37 - cool this is so cool you guys like the
00:39 - fact that and now she's been working
00:40 - with us for two
00:41 - and a half years at cp that's insane
00:46 - like that is one of the coolest things i
00:47 - mean nobody i've never seen a training
00:49 - like this
00:50 - like this is so cool that we can talk
00:51 - about this
00:53 - it's crazy right yeah that is insane
00:56 - go ahead hopefully that kind of speaks
00:57 - to how much power there is in
00:59 - um just really putting some effort into
01:03 - the right kind of job application or
01:05 - whatever whatever way that you're
01:06 - reaching out to people
01:07 - putting some thought into it doing your
01:09 - research on who the other person is um
01:12 - really taking your time and especially
01:14 - on platforms like at work you see a lot
01:16 - of
01:16 - copy and pastes yes you know oh my god
01:18 - people just
01:21 - they just apply for this every all these
01:22 - jobs with the same thing it doesn't
01:24 - speak to
01:24 - your own application to the skills to
01:26 - the character which if you can just take
01:28 - that time to really
01:29 - um really hone in on what they're asking
01:32 - for
01:33 - yeah um because i mean all the time to
01:36 - your point i would get these like
01:37 - garbage messages on upwork and just like
01:40 - hey really interesting project you have
01:43 - there
01:44 - i could definitely help you and then
01:46 - blah blah and i'm like
01:47 - that's your what 104th copy paste of the
01:50 - day
01:51 - you know yeah and so when i saw a
01:54 - message like
01:55 - yours it was extremely refreshing to see
01:58 - somebody who actually
01:59 - read what we had written and wrote
02:02 - specifically for that
02:04 - so like what rachel is saying is like
02:06 - guys stop
02:07 - using canned
02:10 - messages when you reach out to these
02:12 - platforms it's not a game of volume it's
02:14 - a game of like
02:15 - reaching out with quality yeah yeah oh
02:18 - totally totally um and i want to even
02:21 - read out your message because i think
02:22 - it's really important you guys could
02:23 - even use this as a template
02:25 - so rachel reached down and she said hi
02:28 - there and she goes
02:29 - i really enjoyed reading your job
02:31 - posting and it would be awesome to chat
02:34 - with you about whether i'd be a good fit
02:35 - for the role honestly when i read this i
02:38 - thought it was like
02:39 - a canned message probably you know most
02:42 - likely
02:43 - because that's what i got from a lot of
02:44 - people but then this is where i got
02:46 - interested
02:47 - i love problem solving and getting tech
02:49 - tools to work together
02:51 - my background is ten years in
02:52 - accountancy and admin but six months ago
02:55 - i transitioned to a va tech and my ideal
02:57 - work is in problem solving
02:59 - so here she said problem solving love
03:02 - problem solving
03:03 - in my initial job posting i had
03:06 - mentioned
03:07 - problem solving multiple times um yeah i
03:10 - think i've popped the post a little
03:11 - further down as well because so it's
03:13 - there in case yeah
03:14 - oh yeah that's awesome we can actually
03:15 - take a look at that too
03:18 - um oh wow even amanat is
03:21 - he's like um he's this letter is amazing
03:23 - i've never thought of writing a letter
03:25 - like that
03:25 - finally wishing him good this is awesome
03:28 - so
03:28 - here um so i've got experience in
03:31 - leadpages and various email webinar
03:33 - payment course systems
03:35 - these specific systems we were talking
03:37 - about
03:38 - but not kajabi and this is honestly one
03:41 - of those things that kind of just like
03:42 - hits you in the heart like this was one
03:44 - of the things where i'm like
03:46 - not only do we not have somebody who's
03:49 - possibly
03:49 - really good at it but the fact that she
03:53 - says openly she doesn't know kajabi
03:56 - and not like some wishy-washy
03:59 - answer like literally she's like not
04:01 - kajabi
04:03 - that is huge because already i can tell
04:06 - so much about her
04:07 - character and integrity and i want to
04:10 - work with somebody on the team who has
04:12 - character and integrity
04:14 - i don't want to work with people who put
04:17 - politics
04:18 - above everything else right
04:21 - so going on and she goes yet i'm really
04:24 - keen to learn all of these systems so
04:25 - that's important to me that she's very
04:27 - flexible
04:29 - and so would be very happy in my element
04:31 - in fact to learn them
04:33 - quickly and on my own time like that is
04:36 - just
04:37 - beautifully written it's like somebody's
04:39 - dream to have somebody like that working
04:41 - on their team
04:42 - where they're like hey i would i don't
04:45 - know them this is actually funny right
04:47 - because
04:47 - at the start of this video that's what i
04:50 - said
04:50 - if you don't know it just say it and say
04:52 - i'll be able to willing to learn later
04:54 - literally what you say here and um
04:58 - we have messages that are like joseph
05:00 - says
05:01 - this is a working template nice one
05:03 - rachel
05:04 - o'shea says rachel's letter is perfect
05:07 - it's brief
05:08 - specific and detailed really good job
05:12 - so lucy says this is so
05:15 - useful hassan says eloquent
05:19 - amazing job says amanath abdullah says
05:22 - yeah rachel
05:23 - amazing job no thanks guys
05:26 - yeah seriously it's actually really
05:28 - amazing and then she goes i love
05:30 - research and have found some great
05:32 - resources so i can
05:33 - quickly get familiar with them i pride
05:35 - myself in being proactive a strong
05:37 - communicator and a great team player
05:40 - honestly this statement i trust if
05:43 - anybody else says it i would just ignore
05:45 - it
05:45 - but like do you guys know what makes me
05:49 - want to trust this statement more like
05:52 - what
05:52 - out of this entire thing what was it
05:55 - that makes me actually trust this
05:57 - statement
05:57 - more and if you want to guess drop it in
06:00 - the comments below but for me
06:02 - it was actually this statement where she
06:04 - just openly is so honest
06:06 - and willing to say i don't know kajabi
06:10 - and then when you say you pride yourself
06:12 - in being a strong communicator and great
06:14 - team player
06:15 - i trust you see what i'm saying yeah
06:18 - yeah like
06:19 - because i'm like okay i she why would
06:21 - you say that
06:22 - if you were somebody who was just lying
06:24 - you know because you literally went out
06:25 - of your way to say you didn't know
06:27 - something
06:28 - yeah yeah um abdullah says amazing tips
06:32 - thanks for the advice sure says this is
06:33 - nice um
06:35 - we have everything ipad pro says the way
06:38 - she writes is just beautiful
06:41 - yeah minik says i've never thought of
06:44 - writing such a thing this is awesome
06:46 - yup and then she even goes on to say
06:48 - look forward to hearing from you if
06:50 - you'd like to discuss more and
06:51 - best of luck with finding someone
06:53 - awesome i mean
06:55 - who goes out of their way to even
06:57 - encourage you and be
06:58 - happy for you to find somebody else
07:00 - that's awesome
07:02 - ending on such a positive note is
07:04 - another huge
07:05 - thing everything eyepatch pro says
07:08 - rachel is an independent and strong
07:10 - woman and uh she's proud of you
07:13 - oh thank you yeah yeah
07:18 - and um i'm gonna read i think ahmad had
07:22 - a really nice message to this
07:23 - and he says he said the letter is
07:25 - amazing i've never thought of writing
07:27 - such a letter
07:28 - finally wishing them and and he goes you
07:31 - finally wishing somebody good luck and
07:33 - finding that is
07:34 - this seriously shows the mindset of
07:36 - rachel
07:39 - so so that's yeah so that's huge because
07:42 - it shows where
07:45 - her mindset is and this is the letter
07:48 - that like resulted in i don't know fifty
07:50 - thousand dollars and more
07:52 - like i don't know i don't even know at
07:53 - this point how where we're at
07:56 - but like this is literally has led to
07:59 - over a 50 000 transaction and
08:03 - probably we're gonna work till many many
08:06 - more years like
08:07 - we like literally i would love to have
08:09 - rachel on the team for the next three
08:10 - five
08:11 - ten years on clever programmer and it
08:13 - all
08:14 - came from right here so it doesn't
08:17 - really get any more real than this
08:19 - yep pretty crazy
08:23 - that's crazy right
08:27 - you never thought one day your letter
08:29 - that you were gonna write was gonna be
08:30 - like broadcasted to thousands of people
08:34 - no i really didn't oh man i think you're
08:37 - right you're right
08:38 - it just shows the power of taking that
08:40 - time taking that time to really stop
08:42 - um stop think put yourself in the other
08:44 - person's shoes as to what they're
08:45 - looking for and
08:46 - yeah and like like we were talking about
08:48 - to put yourself in the right
08:50 - state when you're when you're
08:51 - approaching it as well you know put
08:53 - make sure you're in that positive place
08:54 - where you can write it with like all of
08:56 - the enthusiasm and
08:57 - best intentions and then you know let go
09:01 - yes yep uh john ford says rachel is a
09:05 - true professional
09:06 - her work her insta profile and this
09:08 - letter now
09:10 - everything speaks about how cool and
09:12 - good at her work she is
09:13 - simply amazing be like rachel
09:16 - no damn and o'shea says it takes
09:19 - just one good letter to change your life
09:22 - yep and uh kringet says nice message
09:26 - it's awesome the whole thing especially
09:27 - about being honest yep
09:31 - so i mean yeah this is something that's
09:34 - really valuable if you guys want to take
09:35 - a screenshot of this before we move on
09:37 - go ahead and do that it'll give you kind
09:40 - of like a template but again
09:42 - her whole point is personalized yeah
09:45 - yeah totally but even within
09:47 - personalization this is a good template
09:48 - to kind of work off of
09:51 - so what else rachel before we move on to
09:54 - the next slide
09:55 - yeah i'd say um obviously i'm talking
09:57 - about how important personalizing is
10:00 - but there's a little note there about um
10:01 - a swipe file and by that what i mean is
10:04 - not copy and paste in
10:05 - um the same thing to every job but just
10:07 - having a couple of notes
10:08 - um if you know if you're doing a lot of
10:11 - outreach
10:12 - um you're reaching out to quite a few
10:14 - people that you're really interested in
10:16 - just having a little kind of swipe file
10:18 - of phrases that explain your skills that
10:19 - you can
10:20 - steal wording from so you don't put too
10:21 - much mental energy into that that's
10:23 - unnecessary i think that's something
10:25 - that's quite handy too
10:26 - yep a hundred percent so definitely use
10:31 - have those handy so that you can use
10:33 - them as reference and then grow
10:35 - like leverage them to be be able to
10:37 - write
10:38 - but guys yeah this is something that's
10:40 - really important it shows you
10:42 - it's not so much praying spray and just
10:44 - like
10:45 - reach out to 5 000 locations
10:48 - you can if you spend more time and you
10:51 - reach out with precision
10:52 - your success rate honestly is going to
10:54 - be much higher don't
10:56 - overthink it as well like don't spend
10:58 - three hours on a message
11:00 - but if you just spend 15 minutes and 10
11:02 - or 10 minutes personalizing
11:04 - write it and move on that would be
11:06 - really good yeah
11:08 - awesome so assad ali says i'm about to
11:12 - start my first freelancing job this is
11:13 - really
11:14 - helpful you guys deserve a lot thank you
11:16 - guys
11:17 - awesome yeah congratulations
11:20 - yeah uh tam mayor tim maryland says
11:23 - rachel i would want
11:24 - you to teach me writing true and very
11:26 - like detailed messages like these
11:28 - that's cool how to have a chat with you
11:32 - awesome okay so let's keep it moving so
11:34 - let's go on to the next one
11:37 - and uh this was the actual job posting
11:40 - right mm-hmm
11:42 - yeah yep so this is the job posting go
11:45 - ahead
11:45 - i'm just gonna say we just cut it up so
11:47 - yep that's it
11:49 - so yeah this is the posting guys this is
11:51 - part like this is
11:52 - you know the first part of it this is
11:53 - the second part of it it's the same
11:55 - posting yeah we just cut it up so it's
11:56 - all on the same page
11:58 - but like uh my main thing we were
12:00 - looking for was
12:02 - people who knew about all these
12:03 - technologies kajabi drip click funnel
12:06 - sam cart webinar jam zap
12:07 - zapier but i said like we need someone
12:10 - who can manage these systems
12:11 - understand how they work and be able to
12:13 - do it and
12:14 - um i wrote some specific things like
12:18 - you should be able to understand what we
12:19 - mean when we say x y z
12:22 - and if you don't know this you'd love to
12:24 - research it
12:25 - until you understand how it works and
12:27 - can put it together
12:29 - so you know going back and here i
12:31 - mentioned kajabi and going back to what
12:32 - rachel said
12:34 - she said in her message that she doesn't
12:36 - know kajabi but she's willing to
12:38 - learn it right and so she also
12:40 - understood like where i was coming from
12:42 - and then she mentioned that and she said
12:43 - i'd be willing to learn so it matches up
12:45 - to
12:46 - kind of what we were looking for and we
12:49 - said the right person will be confident
12:51 - in his
12:52 - his slash her intuition to figure out
12:55 - figure it out and get the job done
12:57 - correctly
12:58 - you may not know every platform but this
13:00 - is a type of work that makes you feel
13:01 - invincible
13:02 - and you are smart enough to figure it
13:04 - out and definitely when i spoke with
13:06 - rachel she already knew a lot of things
13:08 - and what she didn't know
13:09 - she said she would be willing to learn
13:11 - and then when i went on
13:12 - her social media on her facebook it
13:15 - confirmed with me she that she
13:17 - wasn't just saying words to say whatever
13:20 - she needed to say to get a job
13:22 - she was backing it up with her actions
13:25 - and i could see three months ago she was
13:26 - like
13:27 - posting about going down rabbit holes
13:29 - and learning about technology
13:31 - yeah so that was huge
13:34 - cool go ahead and remember also with
13:37 - that kazee
13:38 - right at the end of the requirements um
13:40 - and it said you wanted a minimum of two
13:42 - plus years hands-on
13:43 - administrative support experience oh
13:45 - yeah yeah so and i know
13:47 - things like that would sometimes put
13:48 - people off with the specifics oh yeah
13:49 - that was just complete like i
13:51 - don't even know what that meant
13:53 - i just put that i had no idea what that
13:55 - even meant
13:56 - i don't what is administrative support i
13:58 - have i had no idea
14:00 - exactly so it's always it's always worth
14:02 - it's always worth applying to something
14:04 - if you read it and you think yes
14:06 - and you connect you know even if there's
14:07 - something like that
14:09 - yeah so i mean like it also goes to show
14:13 - you that like
14:14 - and you didn't have that right just to
14:15 - be clear you didn't have two plus years
14:17 - of hands-on
14:18 - how much did you have um
14:21 - i think gosh six months to a year maybe
14:25 - at that point yeah so so basically
14:29 - another thing like don't say
14:30 - no for the other person yeah
14:35 - so like she she could have easily just
14:37 - said oh i don't have two years of
14:39 - experience i'm not gonna apply for this
14:42 - but she's just like she she replied for
14:44 - it anyway
14:45 - and it turns out that i was an idiot
14:48 - and i didn't even know what the hell i
14:50 - was looking for and i just put some
14:52 - random stuff in requirements
14:54 - and a lot of people who are looking like
14:56 - a lot of people who are actually posting
14:58 - these jobs
14:59 - from the hr department they even have no
15:02 - idea what the specs are
15:05 - yeah yeah exactly exactly i think you
15:07 - put it so well they're
15:08 - not saying no for them yeah so don't say
15:11 - no for them
15:12 - apply anyway intelligently and don't
15:15 - don't have those weird things put you
15:17 - off you know
15:18 - like um i saw this one post where the
15:20 - developer of the react.js library or
15:22 - something along those lines something
15:24 - really massive
15:25 - got rejected from a job and
15:29 - because they wanted like 10 years of
15:31 - experience
15:32 - and he says i have five years of
15:35 - experience or something along those
15:36 - lines
15:37 - and they're like sorry we need somebody
15:38 - with 10 and then he made a tweet and he
15:40 - says
15:41 - well i got rejected from my job but he
15:44 - goes i wrote the react.js library and
15:46 - it's only been out for five years
15:48 - oh wow so i was like
15:51 - oh wow so somebody can correct me in the
15:54 - chat below it's not really react and
15:56 - it's not the same time frame but the
15:57 - point is similar
15:59 - yeah uh so you know it's
16:02 - it's crazy but yeah all right moving on
16:05 - so what is going on here
16:07 - with this guy yeah this this guy's
16:11 - hiding from video
16:13 - oh no yeah i think the the one thing
16:16 - the other one thing i'd maybe do a
16:18 - little differently now
16:19 - um if i was kind of actively looking for
16:23 - on upwork right now
16:24 - is i would add in video so
16:27 - and in addition to because people like
16:28 - different platforms in addition to that
16:30 - written
16:30 - um message that i sent i would probably
16:34 - make a really short video
16:35 - just so that you can really connect with
16:37 - the other person because video's so
16:38 - powerful
16:39 - game changer so i think if you hop to
16:43 - the next one kazi
16:44 - um we're just talking about loom there
16:48 - and i mean even when you're working with
16:49 - clients like there's an example there um
16:52 - this is loom if if anybody hasn't used
16:53 - it before it's a free tool
16:55 - yep and here's your face this is a video
16:57 - here's her face
16:58 - talking over it and then she's sharing
17:00 - her screen but keep going rachel
17:02 - yeah yeah exactly this is me talking
17:05 - about something in one of our systems
17:07 - in kajabi but yeah i mean even once
17:09 - you're working with clients this could
17:10 - be so powerful just to kind of
17:12 - catch up especially if you're on
17:13 - different time zones and things but in
17:15 - the outreach phase
17:16 - um so so good for them to really get a
17:19 - feel for you
17:21 - um and i mean i've i can imagine that
17:23 - you would do this like if i would say
17:25 - research in clever programmer talk about
17:27 - club program again you could be on the
17:28 - clever program or website
17:29 - you could have that with the screen
17:31 - shared you could show what you were
17:32 - finding
17:33 - and talk over it and yeah the video was
17:36 - so powerful so i would
17:37 - just get comfortable with that um
17:40 - and with something like loom i mean you
17:42 - can even start by practicing if if video
17:44 - is something that is really
17:46 - um terrifying to you um you could just
17:48 - take baby steps
17:50 - yeah you've got things like instagram
17:52 - stories you can use loom and you can
17:54 - just make videos for yourself and just
17:55 - steadily get used to seeing yourself on
17:57 - the camera
17:58 - um and then by the time that you're in a
18:01 - position where you're working with
18:02 - clients and you've got video calls it's
18:03 - just second nature
18:05 - yep exactly i mean i try to
18:08 - start loom but i think my camera is
18:10 - being used up
18:11 - by another device so it's only like a
18:14 - yellow little mark here
18:16 - actually let me yeah let me end it right
18:19 - now
18:19 - but you you guys won't get a yellow
18:23 - mark like this which will happen is loom
18:26 - will record your screen so here
18:28 - i just record it for just a few seconds
18:30 - and you'll see it already created a link
18:32 - and the video is online so if you guys
18:35 - actually went to this link right here
18:38 - you'd be able to see this exact video i
18:40 - can even drop it in the chat
18:43 - and uh i mean it's not a very awesome
18:45 - video but
18:46 - you get the point the fact that i was
18:48 - able to make a video in like a second
18:50 - and then boom it's up so what rachel is
18:52 - saying is
18:54 - she would now actually make a video
18:57 - talking about
18:58 - what the client is looking for and then
19:00 - send that directly through upwork and
19:02 - that will crush
19:03 - if i had seen a video from you i would
19:05 - be like it's game over
19:07 - like i would just yeah i would probably
19:09 - skip the interview
19:11 - that's it it just gives you that so much
19:13 - extra connection doesn't it there's so
19:14 - much you can get from a video
19:16 - yep as an extra tool
19:20 - exactly so let's
19:23 - let me go full screen this
19:26 - huge tool all right so keep going rachel
19:29 - and if you want me to move on to the
19:30 - next one i can do that too
19:32 - yeah sure let's um let's scoot down to
19:34 - the next one
19:36 - all right let's do it and ahmad says
19:38 - seriously the years of experience
19:40 - doesn't matter if you have the skills
19:41 - and that's it
19:42 - most people are afraid to apply for jobs
19:44 - when they see
19:45 - that years of experience mm-hmm yeah
19:49 - so true it's
