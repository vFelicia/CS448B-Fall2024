12:28 - question daniel what makes a 65
12:30 - developer
12:30 - well there's lots of things but it's
12:32 - gonna boil down to just a few things
12:34 - right
12:35 - because when we're trying to become the
12:37 - six figure developer
12:38 - we have that goal and we set it out in
12:40 - front of us so that we can hit it
12:41 - you're going to want to work on specific
12:43 - skill sets whether technical or soft
12:45 - skills
12:46 - and you're going to want to develop
12:47 - yourself as a person to be able to get
12:50 - to that point of being a six figure
12:51 - developer yes yes yes so
12:53 - guys let's let's check it out so hello i
12:55 - like money i mean of course everybody
12:57 - likes money crusher crab
12:58 - loves money very much okay who doesn't
13:00 - love money you know we always say a lot
13:01 - mine does not make us happy and at some
13:03 - points it does but not having mine does
13:05 - not make us happy either so
13:06 - so you have to be careful with that
13:08 - exactly so as you do want to
13:10 - make more money you need to make sure
13:12 - you have that
13:13 - roadmap right you want to make sure that
13:16 - you have the goal set up in front of you
13:17 - the right one so that you could work
13:19 - closer and closer
13:20 - to achieving it day and day again and
13:23 - that's why
13:24 - nas is going to break down his
13:25 - experience so you can have that road map
13:27 - and then we're going to just dive deep
13:29 - into becoming six figures guys very
13:31 - important that's going to smash that
13:33 - like button for the youtube algorithm
13:35 - as you know we have done an amazing job
13:37 - i would say so
13:38 - the past four days as the day five so i
13:41 - would appreciate that if you guys just
13:42 - smash it
13:43 - if you just go ahead and share this
13:44 - video with everybody else just again the
13:46 - more people
13:46 - the more people view it the more people
13:48 - know about it the better that way we get
13:49 - to share the knowledge that we currently
13:51 - have with the more people again
13:52 - let's go ahead and get to 200 likes we
13:54 - are currently at 147
13:56 - i never get 200 really quickly all right

15:50 - like holy [ __ ] how to do this so fast
15:52 - and then what i do is i end up taking a
15:55 - machine learning course a machine
15:56 - learning course
15:57 - of course because i apply machine i have
16:00 - found out that i can apply machine
16:02 - learning to their problem
16:04 - and what i did is i basically created
16:06 - machine learning
16:07 - algorithm that predicted how many leads
16:12 - they'll get in the next few years wow
16:15 - that is huge like
16:16 - prediction like predicting leads and
16:18 - when they saw that they're like holy
16:20 - [ __ ] you know everybody else is kind of
16:23 - doing the projects that they've been
16:24 - told to do
16:25 - i went outside the box and there's
16:26 - something different and that was blew
16:29 - their mind and the other day
16:31 - i got a chance to talk with their head
16:32 - machine learning uh machine learning
16:34 - guy and after he saw this go talk with
16:38 - him
16:38 - he offered the job to beat his team
16:41 - right away
16:42 - like because he loved the the intention
16:44 - so far and then that's when i got
16:46 - offered the 65
16:47 - k right here right here that's what
16:49 - happens when you just offer value
16:51 - right when you bring value to the table
16:52 - when you build your skill sets when you
16:54 - learn new things that are applicable
16:56 - to the job to adding value to a business
16:59 - or company yes you get these amazing
17:00 - offers yes
17:01 - and the crazy thing is again this was
17:04 - i didn't even finish college like
17:06 - college is not the reason why i'm here
17:08 - because it's not the reason why i got
17:09 - this or why i got this
17:11 - but the reason why i got this is because
17:12 - i was very proactive
17:14 - i was very bold like being bold is big
17:17 - guys being bold
17:19 - is very big okay and being able to be
17:22 - risky
17:22 - and be risky with what you want to do
17:24 - and being [ __ ] like
17:26 - being so damn on the line in terms of
17:29 - what you want to do in your life
17:31 - okay that's the most important thing if
17:33 - you just kind of stand around waiting
17:34 - for things to happen they won't happen
17:35 - i'm sorry
17:36 - but if you be bold and if you go towards
17:39 - it like a bowl
17:40 - that's when change gets created okay
17:42 - awesome let's move on
17:43 - there's another company this is uh
17:45 - actually i had
17:47 - did not go with this company when they
17:48 - offered me this money because this other
17:50 - company offered me this money
17:52 - so by the way and again this was a
17:55 - one-day interview and they love what i
17:56 - end up doing and they offer me uh this
17:58 - is again college is not even finished
18:00 - yet so they offered me 70k right after
18:02 - that so that was really cool
18:03 - uh again this is a company after when i
18:06 - just started doing freelancing i worked
18:07 - for com with the company called
18:08 - approved me when i did freelancing that
18:10 - was a lot of fun i got to build
18:12 - one of the biggest react.js projects
18:14 - this whole project was in react.js pro
18:16 - wow and it had millions of millions of
18:18 - lines of code
18:19 - millions of lines of code it was in thai
18:22 - script react gs
18:23 - redux all the stuff you guys learned
18:25 - here
18:26 - learned here this is teaching from like
18:29 - our
18:30 - our knowledge from our real world
18:33 - experience to you
18:34 - right this is real word world stuff i'm
18:36 - not kidding i'm not kidding okay

18:41 - friends is still working with them but
18:42 - of course i'm not because i'm
18:43 - so focused with you guys okay awesome so

18:51 - thousand five thousand dollars
18:52 - oh just so you know these guys paid
18:54 - around twenty thousand dollars
18:56 - but that's only for about a month and a
18:58 - half so
18:59 - so that was pretty good you know that
19:01 - was pretty good so
19:02 - um uh discovered me another project do
19:05 - they pay 5k
19:06 - not for the design but they paid 5k
19:09 - honestly
19:10 - just for a software requirements
19:13 - document which by the way is something
19:14 - we teach how to do
19:15 - in profit javascript again you will have
19:17 - the early bird price
19:19 - on sunday so make sure you go there okay
19:21 - but they literally just paid me for a
19:22 - requirements document for 5k
19:24 - just to build this like to put build
19:25 - requirements out can you believe that
19:26 - bro that is huge that's insane that's
19:28 - crazy yeah
19:29 - so and so like like like i know you're
19:31 - like like yes you did all this stuff but
19:33 - how did you do it now it's like
19:34 - how did they happen well it didn't
19:37 - happen overnight and
19:38 - didn't happen easy and it was not easy
19:40 - and it took a lot of sweat and tears
19:41 - okay but
19:42 - how did it happen it's a good question
19:44 - well so again this is me you guys know
19:46 - um just a regular guy just like you are
19:48 - you guys are
19:49 - but i'm very i love my work and i'm very
19:52 - hard working that's the one thing that i
19:53 - can tell about myself okay
19:55 - um yeah i gotta get a chance to
19:57 - interview companies like google khan
19:58 - academy squarespace this is a lot of fun
20:00 - these guys actually flew me out to
20:01 - california for free
20:03 - they gave me a really nice hotel and uh
20:05 - paid for everything pretty much that was
20:06 - a lot of fun
20:07 - safety with valentin another great
20:08 - company again flew me out to california
20:10 - literally the hotel pro apparently was
20:12 - 500 per night and i didn't pay for
20:13 - anything
20:14 - nice that was insane that's amazing that
20:15 - was a lot of fun yeah and i got a chance
20:17 - to interview all these companies
20:19 - and so yeah that's kind of about me uh
20:20 - what i end up doing is when i started
20:22 - guys
20:23 - um the process was really cool because i
20:25 - started
20:26 - i realized that college was no good
20:29 - unfortunately
20:30 - college college college college will not
20:34 - not will not get you to get you
20:37 - the real real world experience i'm
20:40 - saying just college i'm not saying
20:42 - college is
20:42 - uh unnecessary i'm not saying any of
20:44 - those things um
20:45 - i'm not get you the real world
20:48 - experience
20:50 - periods i know i have a horrible typing
20:52 - that's okay though
20:53 - uh um experience hold on here's
20:56 - a great coder trust me experience right
20:58 - there he has a lot of typos he's a great
21:00 - character
21:00 - right so the way i kind of found that
21:02 - out is because i was learning a lot of
21:04 - theory as i'm sure you know too right
21:07 - like you learn a lot of theories well in
21:08 - college correct
21:09 - yep and how did you how do you think
21:10 - that kind of helped you out tell me like
21:12 - do you think that something
21:13 - will really push you in in the real
21:16 - world tell me
21:17 - i mean most of what really helped me was
21:19 - what i did on the side which were like
21:20 - the practical
21:22 - uh projects that i would build right the
21:24 - mobile applications or the web
21:25 - applications
21:26 - yes correct and and so and so what did
21:28 - you realize with
21:30 - with theory in terms of what else do you
21:32 - need besides theory tell me
21:34 - what do you mean by that is anything
21:36 - else you realize that you need did you
21:38 - realize that you need anything something
21:39 - else besides theory tell me
21:41 - um you need practical application you
21:44 - build skills you need to build
21:45 - portfolios right you build projects that
21:47 - are going to be able to help you
21:49 - to get to where you want to go again
21:50 - correct at the end of the day it's about
21:52 - having the skill of being able to build
21:54 - an amazing project by yourself right i'm
21:57 - figuring it out by yourself now i don't
21:58 - mean you have to code every single line
22:00 - i don't mean you have to memorize what
22:02 - every single line of code the function
22:04 - not so if you could use google and
22:05 - youtube to help you out
22:07 - you're going to be able to solve a
22:09 - problem not just
22:10 - memorize lines of codes and write them
22:12 - for your tests and homework assignments
22:14 - correct so guys do this so
22:15 - uh i kind of and so what i end up doing
22:17 - is i actually end up going ahead and
22:18 - joining a startup company right here
22:20 - this is called uh trendella it's really
22:22 - fun
22:22 - these guys are amazing they're still one
22:24 - of my user friends steve here he just
22:25 - got married which is insane
22:27 - steve congrats uh now she's yeah so
22:30 - another one of my friends case and this
22:32 - is me as you guys can see this is
22:34 - robert this guy is doing amazing he's
22:35 - working the company right now he's used
22:36 - epic stuff
22:37 - in terms of coding he loves it but
22:40 - together as four people
22:41 - like we were working on this app that
22:43 - was basically bringing
22:44 - clothing together into one application
22:46 - from all these different applications
22:48 - and i'll show you how exactly how it
22:49 - looks like but i came up to them and
22:51 - said hey guys
22:52 - i'm ready to work for free i'm ready to
22:54 - work for free because i just want the
22:55 - experience

22:58 - get me there and so like you know what
22:59 - let's do it
23:00 - they give me a task to do which is to
23:02 - build a python scraper
23:03 - and granted i literally went home and i
23:05 - i you know what i you know what i typed
23:07 - into google what'd you type i tell you
23:08 - what is python
23:10 - what is it literally that's the first
23:12 - thing i type like what is python because
23:13 - they told me to the python script like
23:14 - what the [ __ ] is python you know what i
23:16 - mean
23:16 - so uh at that point kind of what
23:18 - happened is
23:19 - i was like okay great so i found out
23:21 - what python is i found out how to do
23:22 - scraping and i end up doing
23:23 - business creeper and they brought me on
23:25 - to work with them i work with them for
23:27 - about a year for free completely
23:28 - but that year is what changed my whole
23:30 - life it's the reason why i'm here today

27:09 - don't write this kind of stuff down
27:10 - it's not going to be helpful for you at

27:14 - so how much income do you want to make
27:15 - per month in the comments below right
27:17 - now guys
27:18 - how much income do you want to make per
27:19 - month let us know right now okay
27:22 - three thousand don't be like oh crazy
27:23 - i'm like i wanna make a million per
27:24 - month right now
27:26 - okay let's be real realistic okay let's
27:28 - not let's actually be your list in terms
27:30 - of what you want to make and what that
27:31 - will cover right now
27:32 - so you can go like grow your career as a
27:34 - developer yeah i mean
27:36 - you could build up to the million later
27:38 - after you build a cool business but you
27:40 - need to build some skills first so first
27:42 - let's get you to those milestones that
27:44 - are gonna be
27:45 - in your realm of doing within this next
27:47 - year 2021.
27:49 - so let's say let's say this for example
27:50 - everybody's saying like 3k 5k 5k
27:52 - that's not bad so 5k that's really
27:54 - reasonable one guy said 100k per month
27:56 - okay that's not unreasonable
27:57 - i mean if you're a complete pro you're
27:59 - building your sas company like you have
28:01 - all these crazy skills
28:03 - yes you could do that but if you're not
28:04 - there then
28:06 - so five keep a month how much is that
28:07 - per year six sixty thousand that's 60k
28:10 - per year
28:10 - that was not bad but would you say that
28:13 - for a beginner completely
28:15 - that's amazing that's amazing for a
28:16 - complete beginner bro that is an amazing
28:19 - salary guys most people cannot like most
28:21 - people are
28:22 - it's really hard for them to make that
28:23 - kind of money you know what i mean
28:24 - because you also have to keep in mind
28:25 - this is just your first year starting
28:27 - off
28:28 - entry level after that it's just going
28:30 - to skyrocket as you get better
28:32 - as you learn more skills as you
28:34 - understand what you have to do there's
28:36 - probably going to be raises are going to
28:37 - happen
28:37 - you can move to better companies they're
28:38 - going to pay you way more than what
28:40 - you're what they're currently paying
28:41 - exactly okay so now that you know like
28:43 - your 5k per month okay let's now let's
28:45 - talk about expenses okay
28:46 - what are your personal expenses how much
28:48 - how many expenses do you have
28:50 - right now okay that because your course
28:52 - you need to cover your expenses is very
28:53 - important okay you cannot just be on to
28:55 - your expense if you're under your
28:56 - expenses then you're losing money
28:58 - that's not good okay so what are your
29:00 - expenses for example let's let's how
29:02 - much expenses let's just have an example
29:03 - okay
29:04 - let's just say maybe it's 2k per month
29:06 - how about that maybe it's 2k per month
29:08 - maybe this is includes for example rent
29:10 - maybe it might include for example some
29:11 - food and so forth does it include a
29:13 - tesla
29:14 - bro i mean these are not my expenses
29:17 - [Laughter]
29:20 - these are not my expenses all right my
29:23 - sizes are this there's a little bit more
29:26 - but let's just say uh you know for a
29:27 - person how many expenses would you say
29:29 - okay how about this let's just say
29:31 - fine 3k how about that two keep a month
29:33 - okay yeah i think if maybe you have a
29:35 - family
29:35 - this is something that might be and
29:37 - you're living below your means you're
29:38 - not spending like crazy
29:39 - that sounds about right yeah so what
29:42 - identify what it means for you to be
29:43 - rich okay
29:44 - what does it mean for you to be happy
29:46 - with yourself right
29:48 - because because guys it's not just about
29:50 - money
29:51 - money great it will get you what you
29:52 - want you can go on vacation you can you
29:55 - know
29:55 - spend money for yourself for your family
29:57 - for other members of the family
29:59 - that's always the best part right but
30:01 - what makes you feel
30:02 - welcome and so the way i see it is like
30:04 - if it means for you to be rich is like
30:06 - okay at least maybe you have maybe let's
30:08 - say
30:09 - a thousand you can save per month or two
30:10 - thousand you can save a month would you
30:11 - say that's like
30:12 - let's say maybe say a thousand per month
30:14 - is kind of like a good goal would you
30:15 - say that that sounds good great just
30:17 - just like
30:17 - savings okay so save a thousand 1k
30:21 - 1k per month and keep in mind make sense
30:25 - okay cool
30:26 - 10 specific reasons why you need to make
30:28 - more money income
30:30 - exactly because you need to understand
30:32 - your why because once you understand
30:33 - your expenses
30:35 - once you identify what your rich is
30:37 - whether it's going to be just
30:38 - money whether it's going to be time
30:40 - freedom right you want to be just
30:41 - working
30:42 - 20 hours a week or you're going to want
30:43 - remote work at a full-time job with
30:45 - amazing benefits whatever that is
30:47 - next you need to know is your why so
30:49 - that's why you say write 10 specific
30:50 - reasons because 10 is going to challenge
30:52 - you a bit
30:52 - it's going to be a little bit hard but
30:53 - if you could sit down and write down 1
30:55 - through 10
30:56 - and write a specific reason as to why
30:59 - you want these things it's going to
31:00 - solidify
31:01 - in your head and your purpose and you're
31:03 - gonna have a fuel
31:04 - to get you there correct maybe for
31:06 - example you want freedom right maybe you
31:08 - want to be challenged okay
31:09 - maybe you want to be for example you
31:11 - want to have more time for family right
31:12 - so maybe more time for family
31:14 - time for family maybe you want amazing
31:16 - benefits that big tech companies give
31:18 - out yeah maybe
31:19 - you want amazing benefits who know
31:21 - amazing benefits
31:22 - maybe you just want to work with an
31:23 - amazing team right maybe you just want
31:24 - to love people
31:25 - yeah work with amazing people right with
31:27 - busy people all these are
31:29 - are great reasons for why you want to
31:30 - make more income right
31:32 - amazing people because like it or not
31:35 - if you're going to make more income
31:36 - you're going to be working with amazing
31:37 - people probably like that's honestly
31:39 - that simple right if you're gonna be
31:42 - more in my income
31:43 - those people are also going towards your
31:45 - goal they're also working just as hard
31:46 - as you are
31:47 - right so they're most likely have the
31:49 - same driving goals as you do right so
31:52 - always consider that okay cool
31:53 - so we got that portion now let's ask the
31:55 - question would you in that case
31:57 - freelance or would you full time
32:00 - what do you think like what what do you
32:01 - what what did you select i mean
32:03 - it's really going to be depending on
32:05 - anyone's personal preference right
32:07 - because
32:07 - we we talked about this in day one we
32:09 - want to talk about the opportunity
32:10 - and we broke down the pros and cons of
32:13 - freelancing the pros and cons of
32:15 - full-time
32:15 - and it's not exhaustive but again we
32:17 - just want to give you guys
32:19 - that perspective so that you could
32:21 - choose for yourself so i think in the
32:22 - end it's about that self-awareness of
32:24 - what you actually want
32:25 - yeah so let's talk about a little bit of
32:27 - uh benefits of freelancing will benefit
32:29 - from
32:30 - full-time let's show you that okay let's
32:31 - do that right now okay so
32:33 - okay just a few things let's do
32:35 - freelancing right now so freelancing
32:36 - benefits what are some
32:37 - benefits of freelancer tell me so
32:40 - freelancing
32:40 - flexibility on your hours that i think
32:43 - that's a big one that people like
32:45 - billion hours okay what else um
32:48 - you get to choose your clients get to
32:51 - choose your clients that's a
32:54 - positive and you get to choose your
32:56 - clients so a little more context right
32:58 - it's positive because if you do have a
32:59 - lot of clients coming to you you kind of
33:01 - get to choose the ones you're more
33:02 - excited about
33:03 - right and it would be a negative because
33:05 - you have to go figure out how to get
33:07 - your clients
33:08 - right you have to develop some marketing
33:09 - skills you have to develop some selling
33:11 - skills to be able to sell your services
33:12 - to clients
33:13 - that is correct yes okay up next what
33:15 - else is a positive
33:17 - um freelancing let's see man i would say
33:19 - income wise there's a lot of room for
33:21 - growth a lot of room for growth that's
33:22 - true a lot of room for growth
33:25 - you're only limited by how much you want
33:27 - to work right if you want to work
33:28 - less time then obviously you're not
33:30 - going to be making like
33:31 - hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
33:33 - dollars right yes but you do give
33:34 - yourself
33:35 - more time during the week but on the
33:37 - contrary guys because of
33:39 - there's a lot of room to growth when you
33:41 - first start out you're going to be
33:42 - making
33:43 - bad [ __ ] money i'm not gonna lie like
33:46 - you're gonna be making very little money
33:47 - initially as you started out because you
33:48 - don't have any
33:49 - any clients right now and you have zero
33:51 - trust that's the big issue you have zero
33:53 - trust right now you see what i mean
33:54 - but as you build those up it'll start to
33:56 - snowball over time
33:58 - right so that if you're going as
33:59 - freelancer for a couple years you'll
34:01 - have more clients you'll have more
34:02 - portfolios they'll show
34:03 - your work and people are going to want
34:05 - to work with you people are going to be
34:06 - talking about you through referrals
34:08 - and could build up your client base like
34:10 - that little by little but it is
34:12 - a long-term process that's not easy but
34:14 - you can do it yeah
34:15 - now how about full-time full-time well
34:17 - if you have a nice uh
34:19 - if you work at a big tech company you're
34:20 - probably surrounded or what are you
34:22 - gonna put that your paycheck
34:24 - uh yeah you could do steady paycheck
34:25 - yeah your paycheck nice benefits all the
34:27 - cool stuff that those give you right
34:29 - yesterday paycheck amazing benefits
34:31 - right i think the cool thing is amazing
34:32 - people
34:33 - right because yeah if you work at google
34:35 - you can be next to amazing software
34:37 - engineers they're going to be sitting
34:38 - right next to you
34:39 - right yes you're going to get to learn
34:41 - from them you're going to get to work
34:42 - with them
34:43 - and they're going to be the ones that
34:44 - get to review your coding you're going
34:45 - to get to review their coding your
34:47 - skills are just going to
34:48 - blast off after yeah so you get to have
34:50 - many mentors right because
34:51 - as a freelancer you're kind of working
34:53 - more so by yourself that's the issue
34:54 - right
34:55 - you're kind of there you know it's more
34:57 - by yourself you have to figure it out
34:59 - you have to be
35:00 - the man you have to be the project
35:02 - manager
35:03 - project manager the client manager the
35:06 - developer you've got like 10 different
35:08 - hats right
35:09 - um while with a photo you kind of get to
35:11 - focus a little more
35:13 - right in your case just being a
35:15 - developer and that's kind of for some
35:16 - for a lot of people that's a big benefit
35:18 - huge benefit right they don't want to
35:19 - focus on all these different things
35:21 - right
35:22 - they just want to focus on one thing
35:23 - which is becoming a developer and
35:25 - learning the most skills
35:26 - exactly and that's what comes down to
35:28 - you being self-aware of what
35:30 - you want to do and what will make you
35:32 - happy when you're working yes correct so
35:34 - let us know in the comments below guys
35:35 - what do you think you want to be
35:38 - freelance or full-time or even both yeah
35:41 - here's the thing i did both i did both
35:44 - right i did both right there's nothing
35:46 - wrong with doing that i
35:47 - actually i started out yes i did start
35:50 - out initially with
35:51 - i started out with full time correct i
35:53 - tried that i liked it
35:55 - there are some things that i didn't like
35:56 - but and i want to try freelancing
35:58 - and then i went to freelancing it's as
35:59 - simple as that guys that's pretty much
36:01 - it right
36:02 - as you develop the skill you're gonna
36:03 - have more options on what you want to do
36:06 - yes exactly and as i said guys you will
36:08 - be able to go ahead
36:10 - as you keep going you will be able to
36:11 - yourself figure out okay what do i do
36:13 - what do i watch right um what do i learn
36:16 - and so forth
36:17 - and you just be able to kind of you know
36:19 - pave your own path
36:20 - if your own path okay cool awesome
36:22 - moving on
36:23 - so let's break it down let's break it
36:25 - down guys what i need you to do
36:26 - right now is go to the next slide now is
36:29 - dance okay nevermind no
36:30 - no not not yet we'll dance later forget
36:32 - about everything we just talked about
36:33 - forget
36:34 - about your goals because those are nice
36:36 - those are amazing those can fuel you
36:38 - but what you need to do is you need to
36:39 - make sure you focus on the process
36:41 - and you're doing the small steps that
36:43 - are going to take you and get you closer
36:45 - to there because it's nice to think
36:47 - about the 5k a month yeah it's nice to
36:49 - think about the tesla
36:51 - on your driveway but if you're thinking
36:53 - about those things you're not going to
36:54 - enjoy the process and the steps that you
36:56 - have to do
36:57 - to be able to get there correct yes the
36:59 - process is always one of the most
37:01 - important things
37:02 - and just enjoying what you do like you
37:03 - know do you enjoy what you do i enjoy
37:05 - what i do
37:06 - do i enjoy what i do definitely nas
37:08 - enjoys what i love what i do
37:09 - i get to teach you guys and we get to
37:11 - dance and we get to dance
37:12 - like it's the best job in the world you
37:14 - know what i mean ever
37:16 - and so that came first before anything
37:18 - else and that
37:19 - is what brought everything else exactly
37:21 - so let's break this process down
37:23 - for you guys what are the five stages of
37:25 - making a hundred thousand dollars a year
37:27 - nas
37:27 - so your first stage is earning what your
37:31 - first what
37:31 - your first ten to a hundred dollars so
37:34 - how might this come about
37:35 - that might tell me well there's
37:36 - different ways but first if you get to
37:38 - this point
37:39 - congratulations yes because this is huge
37:41 - people downplayed but this is so
37:43 - cool like someone paid you 10. you just
37:45 - did it ten dollars for what for your
37:48 - knowledge
37:50 - so way that this is possible especially
37:52 - if you're starting off
37:54 - is through tutoring right because when
37:56 - you're tutoring
37:57 - you don't have to become a full master
37:59 - of javascript or whatever it is that
38:01 - you're going to tutor you just have to
38:02 - be two steps ahead of the person
38:04 - and someone would be willing to pay for
38:05 - an hour of your time correct to be able
38:07 - to get to that
38:07 - by the way guys really quick if somebody
38:09 - is asking when will we announce the
38:10 - winners most likely we'll announce the
38:12 - winners on sunday so make sure you
38:14 - are there in the webinar guys really
38:16 - important case click the link below
38:18 - the description for the webinar that's
38:19 - when we will announce the winners okay
38:21 - really really really important okay so
38:23 - stay tuned for that cool
38:24 - awesome all right let's go ahead and
38:26 - keep going all right so next thing after
38:27 - you've done that what else is next tell
38:29 - me
38:29 - now you're gonna try to bump that up and
38:31 - try to get to your first thousand
38:33 - dollars
38:33 - per month yes right now again i do also
38:36 - want to add the caveat
38:37 - we're gonna dive deeper into probably
38:39 - more of the freelancing route in this
38:41 - case
38:41 - because if you do go the job route it
38:43 - would take a different path but we're
38:44 - also going to dive
38:45 - deep into that once we talk about the
38:47 - freelancing path so make sure you're
38:48 - paying attention to this
38:49 - right then once you get to 1000 you're
38:51 - maybe potentially looking at five to ten
38:53 - thousand dollars per month
38:54 - which is that is you're ready that's it
38:56 - you're in a career path you're growing
38:58 - you are pretty probably very happy with
39:00 - what you're making and you're just
39:02 - loving what you do
39:03 - and you're loving use the money that you
39:04 - have exactly and then now being
39:06 - consistent step four is you're able to
39:08 - do that for a whole year
39:09 - so that you make that 5k per year
39:12 - and then step five is you just build on
39:14 - those skills investing yourself
39:16 - invest in mentors go to conferences and
39:18 - get to the hundred thousand dollars per
39:20 - year correct
39:21 - correct correct okay let's go and focus
39:22 - that that camera right there
39:25 - beautiful thank you
39:29 - all right it's fine okay cool awesome so
39:32 - guys you can see the breakdown is pretty
39:34 - simple right right here right
39:35 - just i mean i know it's it's kind of
39:36 - like simple it's like what the heck i
39:38 - mean
39:38 - but let's go a little bit deeper okay so
39:40 - when you go ahead and start
39:42 - out with kind of um you know learning
39:45 - right there's we like to call this the
39:47 - pyramid of wealth right
39:48 - the modern javascript developer pyramid
39:51 - of
39:51 - wealth it's a simple simple process that
39:54 - you can just simply follow
39:56 - and well let's check it out so initially
39:58 - when you start out what's going to
40:00 - happen daniel
40:01 - when you start out you just have to
40:03 - learn the right skill sets you have to
40:05 - pick out something start learning at it
40:07 - start to master those things or start
40:09 - the process of mastering those things
40:11 - it's probably going to suck a little bit
40:12 - but that's how you start with everything
40:14 - right of course you have to suck a
40:16 - little bit initially
40:18 - to learn we all sucked yeah we all did
40:20 - too yeah i did not know how to write an
40:22 - html tag
40:23 - yeah you know i mean i didn't even know
40:25 - what ram was on the computer when i
40:27 - first started i didn't know what a
40:28 - semicolon was
40:29 - perfect you know what i mean so you kind
40:31 - of you can start out with that awesome
40:32 - so
40:32 - initially of course guys you have to
40:34 - start out with just simply learning so
40:35 - you learn
40:36 - what you need to learn right knowledge
40:39 - is one of the most valuable things you
40:40 - can have
40:41 - yo
40:45 - victor diaz just dropped a 20
40:48 - donation victory thank you so much man
40:51 - he says
40:52 - my total respect for you giving all the
40:54 - wisdom away for free you guys rock thank
40:56 - you victor
40:57 - you rock man thank you so much thank you
40:59 - everyone who supports and loves this
41:01 - community
41:02 - yeah you guys are amazing whoa thank you
41:05 - i mean that's what's a semicolon
41:08 - don't worry that was knowledge when he
41:09 - started too awesome all right let's keep
41:11 - going guys
41:12 - cool so that was part one right it's
41:15 - always learned right that's that's part
41:16 - one you wanna always get the skills
41:17 - first
41:18 - once you get the skills then you
41:19 - potentially coach right so you can coach
41:21 - other people at this point now
41:22 - now as a coach what can you expect to be
41:25 - coaching
41:25 - tell me you're probably going to want to
41:27 - coach what you just
41:28 - learned right so as you dove into
41:31 - javascript
41:32 - then you're going to want to teach
41:33 - people how to start to use javascript
41:36 - how do they write a function how do they
41:37 - make a class how do they do anything
41:39 - right right and so the thing is the
41:41 - really cool part about this is that you
41:42 - can actually coach
41:43 - others you don't have to be a pro with
41:45 - your coach you see what i mean so like
41:46 - for example if you think about this
41:48 - right
41:48 - let's say this is a timeline and let's
41:50 - say this right here is one
41:52 - two three four and so on these are
41:54 - levels like this is one level one
41:56 - level two level three level four right
41:59 - and when you start out guys you start
42:00 - out where you start out with this level
42:01 - right here
42:02 - level one okay yes sir level one this is
42:05 - you you know
42:06 - the zip nada you're learning how to make
42:09 - a variable
42:10 - zip like you know nothing right level
42:12 - two maybe you know
42:14 - basics right so you know
42:17 - basics at some point right that's basics
42:19 - well check this out because you're here
42:20 - level two
42:21 - who do you think could teach now at this
42:22 - point tell me you could teach the people
42:24 - in the levels under you so people in
42:26 - level one exactly you're suitable to
42:28 - help them out to get
42:30 - to where you're at which is level
42:31 - exactly guys we literally have students
42:32 - who want this
42:33 - through this reaction challenge they
42:35 - apply the same techniques we told them
42:36 - here
42:37 - and they literally started to earn money
42:39 - in the in
42:40 - in the next week or two as a coach as a
42:43 - coach
42:44 - teaching other people
42:47 - is one great example he was coaching
42:49 - literally within a week
42:50 - by the sunday webinar in the last
42:53 - challenge
42:53 - he has already earned earned more than a
42:56 - hundred dollars
42:57 - oh my god that is amazing so you got
43:00 - past level one basically yeah
43:01 - now yeah level three maybe you know some
43:03 - projects right so maybe you build some
43:04 - projects you have some good confidence
43:06 - right so you know
43:06 - you know that at this point what can you
43:08 - teach do you think you could teach level
43:10 - one and
43:11 - now you're here you can teach this and
43:13 - you can teach this also right
43:14 - exactly the possibilities are endless
43:16 - and it goes on
43:18 - and on and on and on go ahead and here's
43:20 - the cool thing as you're teaching these
43:21 - things
43:22 - you're reinforcing what you're learning
43:24 - and getting
43:26 - i think jesse jesse says when you're
43:29 - teaching you get to learn it twice
43:31 - yeah right exactly you get to learn
43:33 - twice so
43:34 - that's probably one of the best things
43:35 - let's go ahead but the thing is you know
43:36 - you don't have to worry about level
43:37 - tense when you get to too good it's
43:39 - actually not good for like level 10 to
43:40 - teach all the way level one
43:42 - because level 10 right they are for
43:44 - example they might be like
43:46 - at this point too good like as as in
43:48 - they don't see from perspective of a
43:50 - beginner
43:51 - but because you see it from perspective
43:53 - a beginner that's where things are
43:54 - different and so it's actually easier
43:56 - for you
43:56 - as it began to teach other beginners you
43:58 - understand that exactly so don't be
44:00 - scared of level 10
44:01 - because you're probably a better teacher
44:02 - yes if you're on level three or level
44:04 - four because you
44:05 - just went through that awesome so let's
44:07 - okay so we went to the coaching side
44:09 - oh sure yeah so actually what we're
44:11 - gonna do is we're gonna quickly go
44:12 - through a couple of slides to break it
44:13 - down to help you get to your first
44:15 - you know couple thousand dollars a month
44:18 - if you want to go
44:19 - down this road let's do it okay so let's
44:21 - talk about your stream of income
44:23 - in the first one or three months where
44:24 - you're learning javascript coding okay
44:26 - okay it only applies if you are working
44:28 - hard extremely hard guys of course
44:30 - really important where
44:30 - you know if you're not working hard and
44:32 - what what are you doing what are you
44:33 - doing i think you shouldn't
44:34 - be here sorry like without working hard
44:38 - at work you can't really get nowhere
44:39 - like
44:40 - yeah you know what i mean like yeah and
44:41 - the second thing is you just have to
44:43 - remember
44:43 - you want to teach a person just one or
44:46 - two steps behind you yes
44:48 - correct this exact thing that we're
44:50 - about to get so you can make money
44:51 - through
44:52 - teaching code let's set your hourly rate
44:54 - okay for example let's think about this
44:56 - let's say you already said you started
44:57 - 15 per hour that's pretty good it's
44:59 - awesome that's pretty good okay
45:01 - and especially if you for example
45:02 - actually in another country
45:04 - you still said that it's not really
45:05 - great yes may they be for example you're
45:07 - in
45:08 - pakistan or anywhere everywhere else
45:09 - that's like some besides us
45:12 - that's still pretty good that's really
45:13 - good money great money right
45:15 - okay so usually people we you have let's
45:18 - say four weekly coaching calls okay
45:20 - maybe you have four people you have four
45:21 - weekend coaching calls let's say you
45:22 - know
45:23 - you have four weekly coaching calls
45:25 - meaning you have one coaching call per
45:27 - week
45:28 - in one month you mean how much sixty
45:30 - dollars
45:31 - oh sixty what one per week okay got you
45:33 - yes yes yes yes yes yes you made 60
45:35 - bucks okay
45:36 - that's right there that already is your
45:38 - one two hundred dollar income guys right
45:40 - there
45:40 - okay you already crossed your 100 one to
45:43 - one
45:43 - uh ten two hundred dollar income right
45:45 - there that's your first crossing point
45:46 - okay
45:47 - and all you need is just simply one
45:49 - person
45:51 - you need to find that one person that's
45:53 - it that's it and finally one person is
45:55 - actually not that hard
45:56 - with the amount of demand that there is
45:57 - right now for coding
45:59 - okay up next so let's talk about how we
46:01 - can find these students
46:02 - well what you just need to find is 50 to
46:04 - 100 qualified people yes if you just
46:06 - have a 5
46:07 - conversion rate you'll be getting 2 to 5
46:10 - students
46:11 - a week yes so if you think about this
46:13 - right so let's think about what
46:14 - five percent conversion rate five
46:16 - percent conversion conversion rate what
46:18 - does that mean
46:18 - daniel that means if you get a hundred
46:20 - people to talk to you
46:22 - five of them are gonna become clients to
46:24 - talk
46:25 - to talk talk five
46:28 - five are clients now how much is it how
46:31 - hard is it to talk to 100 people
46:33 - well it's really not that hard if we go
46:36 - to the next slide where we could show
46:37 - you exactly
46:38 - where we can find them look at this but
46:41 - before we even go there guys
46:43 - right if you think about this five let's
46:44 - say five our clients okay
46:46 - you're looking at potential income of
46:48 - 120 to 100
46:51 - right and 300 per month now guys i just
46:54 - want to re-emphasize this
46:55 - some people look at these numbers and
46:57 - laugh at them or say like that's not
46:58 - enough yeah but guys
47:00 - if you're getting started in the
47:01 - freelancing world if you're getting
47:03 - someone to pay you fifteen dollars for
47:06 - one
47:06 - session for you to teach for one hour
47:09 - for one hour for you to teach them
47:10 - something you are developing an
47:13 - incredible
47:14 - skill at this point that's only gonna
47:15 - help you to increase this
47:17 - further time and time again to where
47:18 - potentially your one hour
47:20 - can be worth like nauseous which is 250
47:23 - yes
47:24 - dollars i now charge i now charge people
47:27 - who want to just probably do private
47:28 - coaching
47:29 - i charge 250 dollars per hour guys
47:32 - and that is not a joke and that's
47:34 - because i can show you the proof exactly
47:36 - that's because nas has built up the
47:37 - skill
47:38 - over time but he started somewhere he
47:39 - started actually he didn't even start
47:41 - here he started for free he told you
47:43 - he worked for free for an entire year
47:45 - and a half guys
47:46 - because he understands that you just
47:48 - need to build the skill over time so
47:50 - yeah 120 to 300 a month is amazing
47:53 - it's just nas didn't even do that i know
47:56 - you just need to be a little [ __ ]
47:58 - my my per month was zero
48:01 - per month that's how i started guys
48:04 - right there zero per month let me show
48:05 - you
48:06 - zero per month guys what and by the way
48:09 - guys we'll go go ahead and finish up and
48:10 - then we'll we'll give you a shout out
48:11 - zero month guys
48:13 - guys i think again guys i just want to
48:14 - show you we have one
48:16 - another domain donation which is amazing
48:18 - thank you so much the rich programmer
48:20 - mr frank himself ramos
48:23 - so much man awesome video finding great
48:25 - ways to make a living writing code
48:27 - let's go frank thank you so much for the
48:31 - 4.99 donation i was like 4.99 you know
48:35 - not five or forty nine we're going to be

48:40 - appreciate your support
48:41 - and your love for the community man yeah
48:43 - always always awesome guys
48:44 - okay cool so now let's talk about case
48:46 - you've understood that it's possible and
48:48 - it wouldn't be cool to just make 300
48:49 - extra per month like that's that's still
48:51 - pretty good amount of cash
48:52 - amazing like you could you know towards
48:54 - the car towards anything towards maybe
48:56 - not tesla but towards the
48:57 - regardless anything else you know what i
48:59 - mean amazing but
49:00 - where to find students now let's talk
49:02 - about this okay where do you find now
49:04 - students okay
49:05 - five students well there's many places
49:07 - guys to find people
49:09 - for you okay uh well
49:12 - if you think about funny people there's
49:15 - one thing to think about
49:17 - that's not the gary vee always says it's
49:19 - attention
49:20 - wherever there is attention guys if
49:22 - there's a tension
49:24 - that's where you go looking for it make
49:25 - sense good
49:27 - because here's the thing now where is
49:29 - attention facebook groups and stage
49:31 - number one
49:33 - instagram attention number two why is
49:35 - that intention number three right
49:37 - why isn't this is where you can actually
49:38 - apply as a teacher and just literally
49:40 - find clients like that
49:41 - take lessons another attention okay
49:43 - linkedin you have
49:44 - hundreds of people who are looking to
49:46 - learn to become programmers guys i'm not
49:48 - kidding
49:48 - craigslist put up your craigslist ad
49:51 - fiverr oh fire probably the best place
49:53 - to start
49:53 - you start out with literally five
49:55 - dollars that's your first starting point
49:56 - there's hundreds of people looking for
49:57 - you right
49:58 - but these facebook groups this is where
50:00 - some of our students actually
50:02 - found their students rishi one of the
50:04 - guys
50:05 - who was maybe even a chat but he's
50:06 - actually working with us right now
50:08 - he started off by finding people through
50:10 - instagram through facebook groups
50:12 - literally he just called cold called he
50:14 - went to
50:15 - you know what he did what'd he do he
50:18 - went to
50:19 - coding coding facebook groups like right
50:21 - now guys right now if you guys have time
50:23 - i mean still stay on this
50:24 - live call but find a facebook go to
50:27 - facebook.com
50:28 - and do type in javascript group
50:31 - like javascript for example javascript
50:35 - group right there right this will give
50:37 - you a humongous javascript
50:38 - of people who are interested in
50:40 - javascript boom right there
50:42 - it's so simple you go there you start
50:45 - helping people out
50:46 - you reach out to them directly you say
50:48 - hey i see what you're doing this is
50:50 - amazing it by the way
50:51 - if you're interested in potentially
50:52 - getting learning more javascript
50:55 - i myself am a teacher and i love to
50:56 - teach and would love to teach you as
50:58 - well
50:58 - again if you're interested let's get on
50:59 - a call literally just say that and
51:01 - you're done
51:02 - make sense makes sense and then you and
51:04 - then you close them exactly so i've
51:05 - gotten 100 people from all these
51:07 - different spots
51:08 - the next thing is over time as you build
51:11 - your skill
51:12 - you're just gonna want to learn how to
51:14 - increase your charges
51:15 - exactly right so when you first start
51:17 - out you might be making what you might
51:19 - be making what 15 per hour
51:20 - 15 per hour 15 per hour let me see 15
51:23 - per hour right there
51:25 - okay that might be starting rate but
51:27 - again as you get better your price
51:28 - increases guys okay
51:30 - as you get better as you get more
51:31 - clients your price increases
51:32 - dramatically so you might be going from
51:33 - 15 per hour
51:34 - to now let's say at this point you might
51:36 - be going towards uh
51:38 - let me get the brush tool here you know
51:40 - you are going towards what
51:41 - 15 to 25 per hour within three months
51:43 - actually probably been faster like
51:45 - literally guys when you have your first
51:47 - client your second client might be 25
51:49 - per hour literally right
51:50 - there that's what i've been told a lot
51:51 - of times 25 per hour
51:53 - your first client just to get from the
51:55 - door for 50 per hour your next client
51:57 - increase the price of 25 per hour
51:59 - done you're done pro tip do group
52:01 - coaches instead of individual coaching
52:03 - charge more pro clients yes
52:04 - so this is actually one time of the
52:06 - rishi we should probably talk to rishi
52:07 - about this because that's really cool
52:08 - this is what he does so so well is he
52:11 - started out with doing
52:12 - group coaching with people and so he'd
52:14 - be able to actually make
52:15 - about 2k per month or one i think 1k or
52:17 - 2k per month
52:18 - just on group coaching right you put
52:21 - everybody into this
52:22 - humongous group right and the coach all
52:24 - of them
52:25 - that's cool because you have one hour
52:26 - you're spending right on
52:28 - 10 20 different people who paid you the
52:30 - same amount of money
52:32 - that's huge man right you're making your
52:34 - time worth it even more i mean think
52:36 - about this right
52:36 - let's say you have 10 people on the
52:38 - group coaching let's say they paid you
52:40 - 15 per hour so it's 15 per 15 people
52:42 - okay
52:43 - they paid you how let's say 15 10 people
52:46 - that's 150
52:47 - okay 150 let me see uh 150 bucks
52:51 - right guys this is real stuff 150 bucks
52:54 - okay
52:55 - for one session for one session now and
52:58 - you get them on a group coaching call
53:01 - and now one hour is how much one hour is
53:03 - not equal to what one hour is equal to
53:05 - what now
53:06 - 150. 150 bro
53:10 - guys like this just literally insane yes
53:13 - and guys the reason we're teaching this
53:14 - it doesn't matter if you want to go full
53:16 - time
53:16 - or doesn't matter if you want to go
53:17 - freelancing this is something
53:19 - that anyone can pick up as they're
53:21 - starting out can start to generate an
53:23 - extra side income while learning how to
53:26 - code and
53:27 - examine how to master exactly the skills
53:29 - awesome you're well on your way to
53:31 - making your first hundred dollars
53:33 - with code from there pretty much awesome
53:36 - so
53:36 - like i said we did coaching we did that
53:38 - your next step is what
53:40 - you could go into freelancing and this
53:41 - is the path that you want to go
53:43 - into again and this depends guys
53:45 - freelancing there's two different
53:46 - there's three different paths right
53:48 - you can do freelancing you can do things
53:50 - like full-time potential right it
53:51 - depends on you
53:52 - right a lot of people will start out
53:54 - with full time right away before they
53:55 - begin to freelance so it really depends
53:57 - on
53:57 - what you can do on which you're able to
53:59 - keep evolve okay make sense
54:01 - good so we have freelance and that's
54:03 - part one okay now there's a freelancer
54:05 - that might require you a few months for
54:06 - you to know just a little bit because if
54:08 - you know zero it might be a little bit
54:09 - hard okay
54:10 - okay so we have and that's where you for
54:13 - example you might be making you know an
54:14 - income of 5k per month that's when
54:16 - you've got your 5k per month okay
54:17 - exactly and again these are just
54:18 - different things that you could start to
54:20 - learn
54:21 - on the side to build these different
54:22 - incomes as well awesome so you can make
54:25 - money through freelancing skills of
54:26 - course translate to what translate to
54:29 - hourly rates
54:30 - right there transit to income pretty
54:31 - simple stuff makes sense cool
54:33 - so you can charge more for freelancing
54:35 - games of course now your hourly
54:36 - rate might be here what 30 to 50 per
54:38 - hour but you might have more hours you
54:40 - might not be doing 40 hours or 20 hours
54:42 - per week
54:42 - let's say for example right so let's say
54:44 - that's 20 hours per week 20 hours per
54:46 - week
54:47 - per week how much is that per week if
54:50 - you make it let's say 30
54:51 - 30 bucks 30 uh 600 that's 600
54:54 - 600 per week you might be making right
54:56 - there right and how much is that per uh
54:59 - per month so now 2 000 2 000
55:02 - 2 400 per month and that is a pretty
55:05 - damn good salary i would say so and guys
55:07 - if you remember what nas showed you
55:09 - right now we said like if you're level
55:10 - one level two level three all the way to
55:11 - level ten
55:12 - yes once you start to get to those
55:13 - higher levels you can graduate
55:15 - from tutoring and start to pick up these
55:17 - contracts that might pay your hourly
55:19 - rate a little bit more as well yes
55:20 - and again this is where you guys get to
55:22 - build things like okay
55:24 - like projects websites small
55:25 - applications like chrome extensions
55:27 - wordpress sites who knows all those
55:29 - things this is where this is how you
55:31 - get started okay next up so where to
55:34 - find clients find clients on freelancing
55:36 - sites
55:36 - like for example there's like upwork
55:39 - upwork like for example freelancer
55:43 - freelancer right there but most
55:45 - importantly you know where to fight
55:46 - clients most importantly bro
55:47 - i was assuming probably in the facebook
55:49 - groups as well and just yes
55:50 - facebook groups but also
55:54 - also something nas did a lot what is it
55:57 - it's actually through people you know
56:00 - it's for people you know that's part one
56:02 - so
56:02 - through people you know so through
56:03 - connections so connections are very
56:06 - important here guys connections
56:08 - go ahead and ask friends your family ask
56:10 - your friends at your front hand like
56:11 - hey guys you but do you know anybody who
56:14 - needs help
56:15 - right but once you got that then
56:18 - conferences
56:19 - right there go to conferences meet
56:21 - people network
56:23 - this is actually how i got my first gig
56:26 - as a freelancer this is how i got paid
56:29 - my first i think
56:30 - i got paid nine thousand dollars for a
56:32 - project wow yes
56:34 - as my first gig so that was pretty damn
56:36 - good i would say so i mean i worked like
56:37 - my ass off for this honestly but
56:39 - but still right conferences one of the
56:42 - most important things to get the best
56:44 - why do you think they exist it's because
56:45 - of people who make money on there right
56:47 - so learn how to write good proposals
56:49 - take time to identify
56:50 - uh what's the code that was interesting
56:54 - that was not good all right take time to
56:56 - find identify clients potential
56:58 - requirements and so forth okay awesome
57:00 - so make your clients search for you
57:02 - really important guys of course
57:03 - you don't want to just be reaching out
57:04 - to clients always you want them to reach
57:06 - out to you
57:07 - as well and this is where social media
57:08 - comes in so so important guys okay

64:57 - what you'll notice is everything we
64:58 - talked about is universal
64:59 - if you want to be a freelancer or if you
65:01 - want to get a job all these things apply
65:04 - you could make money tutoring and
65:05 - helping people learning how to program
65:07 - you could find the right networks at
65:09 - conferences like even if you're looking
65:10 - for a job there's probably recruiters
65:12 - are going to be there's gonna be other
65:13 - software engineers of big tech companies
65:15 - that are like the google io conference
65:17 - right if you schedule your time properly
65:19 - if you schedule daily actions
65:21 - whether it's like hey i gotta learn how
65:22 - to code this stuff or hey i gotta reach
65:23 - out to these people
65:24 - you're gonna be successful so everything
65:26 - we've talked about here is gonna apply
65:27 - to you
65:28 - whether you're trying to make six
65:29 - figures as a freelancer or through a
65:31 - full-time job
65:32 - exactly and really important i just i
65:34 - kind of thought about this one amazing
65:36 - way to find people as well is actually
65:38 - nowhere
65:39 - hackathons oh that is huge yeah
65:42 - networking opportunity amazing
65:44 - networking opportunity guys this is
65:46 - where you find people who are not only
65:47 - developers
65:48 - but potential startup companies who want
65:50 - to hire you for example
65:52 - uh businesses freelancers right people
65:55 - this is the
65:55 - probably on the best networking
65:56 - solutions like for you honestly
65:59 - find a hackathon near you and go there
66:01 - dina
66:02 - one of our students is one to a
66:05 - hackathon
66:05 - want the hackathon and guess what she
66:08 - now has
66:09 - a job as a react.js developer amazing
66:12 - like
66:13 - done you know what i mean and by the way
66:15 - we just got a great question now that i
66:16 - think you're gonna like
66:17 - they said how do we address not having
66:19 - any
66:20 - experience or any relevant experience on
66:22 - a resume
66:23 - well if you don't experience then what
66:25 - you have is pretty simple guys what you
66:27 - have is something called projects guys
66:28 - this is where you put down your projects
66:30 - okay everything that you've done right
66:32 - so for example you see how this section
66:34 - right here this
66:34 - blue section this blue section is only
66:37 - mainly for projects
66:39 - this is the only way we will showcase
66:40 - people that hey this is what i can do
66:42 - this is what i did that's what i left to
66:45 - do
66:45 - so what is a great example of a project
66:49 - i mean what do you think well definitely
66:51 - what we did in the past three days we
66:53 - were able to build
66:54 - an amazing slack clone these are the
66:57 - projects that you could start to learn
66:59 - and you can put on your portfolio
67:00 - exactly so slack clone maybe
67:02 - like for example whatsapp clone but
67:04 - really important guys is don't just
67:05 - build them and copy them
67:06 - i would say build them but also add your
67:09 - own features right add
67:10 - your own features right and then once
67:12 - you're adding your own features can i
67:14 - give you a really
67:14 - small piece of advice this is what our
67:17 - students
67:18 - this is what our students at pwg do they
67:20 - build what they have
67:22 - in our course and then they rebuild it
67:26 - by themselves by themselves
67:30 - again again by themselves fully man
67:34 - fully by themselves that is how you're
67:36 - actually learning it yeah
67:38 - they don't watch the video they don't
67:40 - watch the tutorial know nothing they
67:42 - just rebuild it this is how
67:43 - you probably will learn the most and so
67:46 - you put that on your portfolio you put
67:48 - that on your projects and that's how
67:49 - people see you
67:50 - put yourself out on social media and you
67:52 - should
67:53 - you will you will get the opportunity
67:55 - that you want
67:56 - okay up next okay let's go and move on
67:59 - so
67:59 - really quickly guys as you said uh
68:03 - write a cover letter prepare your
68:04 - interview guys do mock interviews with
68:06 - your friends
68:07 - right around you don't just go into an
68:09 - interview just being fully blank
68:11 - do mock interviews with people around
68:12 - you and negotiate yourself this is gonna
68:14 - happen
68:15 - probably later on when you first get the
68:16 - interview or when you actually get the
68:18 - job so
68:19 - don't worry about this part so much
68:20 - right now this is not the most important
68:21 - part your most important part is just to
68:23 - get the job
68:24 - yes so guys this is the road map
68:28 - to become a web developer specifically a
68:31 - six figure developer because if we look
68:33 - at how much a
68:34 - web developer makes on average you'll
68:37 - notice
68:38 - that it's above six figures right
68:40 - especially if you just go
68:41 - on indeed or anywhere you can look up
68:43 - these jobs with front of developer
68:44 - react js javascript developer what we
68:47 - just learned in these last couple days
68:48 - and this road map that we built out for
68:50 - you guys could be either through
68:52 - just doing your own thing trying to be a
68:53 - freelancer trying to find a full-time
68:55 - job as we showed you the tips you want
68:56 - to do or
68:57 - even both at the same time guys
69:01 - now this opportunity is amazing right

69:05 - mean if you go for example to indeed.com

70:05 - of thousands more opportunities yes
70:06 - they're just always coming in and always
70:08 - growing i literally when i
70:09 - when i researched this like literally
70:11 - two months ago when we did a top five
70:13 - program languages video
70:14 - on youtube it was 50 000 jobs and it's
70:18 - just growing this was only two months
70:19 - ago
70:19 - this is now 61 000 jobs and the crazy
70:22 - thing is
70:22 - it's only 10 000 more a lot of those are
70:25 - probably new so it's probably like 40
70:27 - 000.
70:27 - look at this guys also developer
70:30 - urgently hiring easy apply
70:32 - 100 to 130k per year they want to throw
70:35 - money at you right now they're just
70:37 - grabbing the money and throwing it at
70:39 - you if you have the skills
70:41 - yes yes now granted i'm not gonna like
70:43 - [ __ ] you saying that you're gonna be
70:45 - making this right away okay
70:46 - you need to learn things like for
70:47 - example right aws
70:49 - my javascript look at this javascript
70:51 - look at this right there boom boom right
70:53 - bro look at this it's good it's come
70:55 - from awesome just
70:56 - react okay now again and just to be
70:59 - mindful
71:00 - you don't have to know everything in ten
71:02 - hun here you need to know at least
71:03 - one thing that's on here okay a lot of
71:05 - these job postings that will have
71:06 - aws they have like 20 different
71:08 - technologies
71:09 - they're just doing it to screw you off
71:11 - the purpose of that
71:13 - is to scare people off who are not
71:14 - capable of learning something like this
71:16 - that's the whole goal
71:17 - so when you see something like this and
71:19 - you're like okay well i don't know this
71:20 - i don't know this i know this i know a
71:23 - little of this me but i don't know this

71:28 - will not be hurt if you just simply
71:29 - apply guys okay you will not be hurt at

71:35 - exactly guys you know what i mean
71:37 - awesome so let's go ahead and again
71:39 - you will not be making this this amount
71:40 - of money right away it might take you
71:42 - some time
71:43 - but you might be looking at making you
71:44 - know 70 80k
71:46 - yeah per year depending exactly there's
71:49 - nothing wrong with starting at that 60
71:50 - 000
71:51 - year and building up to this over time
71:54 - yes
71:54 - because again if this is something that
71:56 - you're trying to do if you're trying to
71:56 - do a career transition or this is the
71:58 - first career trying to start yeah this
71:59 - is a lifelong process
72:01 - it's a lifelong process if you can earn
72:03 - 60 000 the next year
72:05 - 70 80 and it takes you a couple years to
72:07 - get to the six figures
72:08 - but then for the rest of your life the
72:09 - next 20 to 30 years you're gonna be
72:11 - earning six figures
72:12 - is that not worth it it's all worth it

77:12 - that is your homework your homework is
77:13 - to register for the webinar that is your
77:15 - homework
77:16 - so mozambique just asked a question he
77:18 - said
77:19 - daniel what kind of projects can i do to
77:22 - integrate data structures like search
77:25 - and sort
77:26 - cues and trees well that's a good
77:28 - question it's actually something we do
77:30 - in our program yes that is a great talk
77:32 - about it for a second yeah we should
77:33 - definitely talk about it so
77:35 - this is a great question because very
77:36 - often i remember when i was in
77:37 - university yes we would do
77:39 - all these crazy algorithm data
77:40 - structures but i never really saw
77:42 - a purpose to them and it wasn't until
77:45 - when i got to the interview questions
77:46 - where they kind of added a purpose to it
77:48 - right
77:49 - yeah so a specific one was when i was
77:50 - google when i was interviewing with
77:52 - google
77:52 - they asked me hey i want you to create
77:55 - an autocomplete
77:56 - so imagine you have a search bar you're
77:57 - typing something in and then there's an
77:59 - auto complete that comes out from that
78:01 - what are you gonna do
78:02 - i was like oh my god what am i gonna do
78:04 - so i like start trying to think of these
78:06 - solutions
78:06 - and i ended up coming and modeling a
78:08 - solution that i didn't know about but
78:09 - it's called the try
78:11 - right and what this try is it's a form
78:13 - of a tree
78:14 - that allows you to search through
78:16 - basically different
78:18 - words that you put into the tree
78:19 - structure and it optimizes it so it
78:22 - doesn't take too long especially if you
78:23 - have millions of words
78:24 - inside of the tree yeah it's really cool
78:27 - it's something we do with our students
78:30 - sorry yeah so i'll just say well now
78:32 - he's going to say while he finishes
78:33 - chewing and
78:34 - drinking but this is what we decided
78:36 - we're like guys let's take this project
78:38 - and put it into our full stack mastery
78:41 - bootcamp yes
78:42 - guys yes and that is one of the projects
78:44 - out one of the hundreds of projects
78:45 - they're gonna build
78:46 - because these are the things that you
78:48 - have to build and learn so you
78:49 - understand them
78:50 - and you understand how they work and how
78:52 - they're applicable it's so much fun and
78:53 - because you get to apply the real world
78:55 - the scenario of something like this
78:56 - you get to learn so much and of course
78:59 - guys these are really
79:00 - it's a meal great question by the way
79:03 - it's a really important topic that you
79:05 - you guys need to focus on okay stop
79:07 - working so much and just being fancy
79:09 - with all your projects
79:10 - do the projects yes but also focus on
79:12 - the fundamentals and the basics
79:15 - focus on those i cannot stress this
79:16 - enough if you don't focus on
79:18 - fundamentals and the basics which by the
79:20 - way is something we focus on
79:21 - very much in pwj and focus mastery as
79:23 - well
79:25 - you will not get the job i'm sorry
79:29 - because when you go to the job what do
79:31 - you think they're testing you for
79:33 - it's pretty simple they are testing you
79:35 - for your problem solving skills and your
79:37 - algorithm skills
79:38 - that's it they're not going to ask you
79:40 - hey can you write me for example a
79:42 - react.js component
79:43 - app or whatever might be right the com
79:46 - the reality is apps is what gets you to
79:48 - the interview right that's your
79:49 - portfolio
79:50 - they see it it's nice okay interesting
79:52 - person let's talk to them
79:54 - when you talk to them they're going to
79:57 - talk to you about what
79:59 - your fundamentals your problem solving
80:02 - how good are you at being able to step
80:03 - outside the box
80:06 - and find a solution to a problem
80:09 - he's really good at finding social to a
80:11 - problem like too good
80:13 - i'm mad at him sometimes yeah literally
80:19 - you know what i mean so that's just one
80:21 - example right
80:23 - so please follow this so yes muslim
80:24 - that's a great question so try is one
80:25 - great another one another one might be
80:27 - for example uh
80:28 - um undo for example um the undo section
80:31 - for example when you do undo that
80:32 - actually has to do with stacks you have
80:33 - to create two stacks
80:35 - the the undo functionality on your
80:37 - computer
80:38 - on like a text editor or anything like
80:39 - that yes exactly so that hopefully that
80:41 - answers your question so before we dive
80:43 - into the questions we also forgot to

88:15 - where uh probably just a couple more up
88:20 - oh my gosh are you the most up to date
88:23 - yeah it is all right it wasn't that far
88:25 - up

88:32 - to impress potential employees with
88:34 - react gs well for one
88:36 - i mean the slack loan here that you just
88:38 - built is amazing so make sure it's clean
88:40 - and make sure it's nice that's part
88:41 - one um yeah i mean it's pretty much any
88:45 - big
88:45 - project that that includes a lot of you
88:47 - know different parts so like for example
88:50 - react gs for example my includes
88:51 - components right style components right
88:53 - anything that may be a little more
88:54 - difficult than just normal that should
88:57 - be always your goal right and you don't
88:58 - just want to do just like for example
89:00 - you know one project do a few projects
89:01 - do a project with one page for example
89:03 - a full stack app with slot clone right
89:06 - include login right that's a big thing
89:07 - that people look for is can you can you
89:09 - put a login functionality right

89:12 - right can you do that
89:14 - um that's always something you want to
89:16 - look for is what
89:17 - features can i include in a project so
89:20 - login
89:21 - logout right maybe live
89:24 - time chat application more pages for
89:27 - example maybe for slack loan guys one
89:28 - thing you can add is
89:29 - a profile page so when you click on your

92:42 - thank you so much i put in my calendar
92:43 - let's go christian it's a good question
92:45 - okay
92:46 - that's a good question here what do you
92:47 - think is it valuable to learn
92:50 - how to sort data structures without the
92:53 - use of methods
92:54 - methods yeah i think it's important to
92:56 - at least know
92:58 - the fastest most optimal ways of is it
93:01 - sorting
93:01 - or yeah of sorting a specific data
93:04 - structure
93:04 - like an array right so in this case if
93:07 - you're going to be doing sorting you
93:08 - could either learn quick sort
93:10 - or merge sort those have both the same
93:12 - big o notation
93:13 - of n login which is the most optimal for
93:16 - sorting
93:16 - you just have to know one of those yes i
93:18 - mean you also can know that
93:20 - you can have a dot sort function that
93:22 - helps you out and does it for you
93:23 - but if you just know the implementation
93:25 - you at least understand how the inner
93:27 - workings of the dot sort function
93:29 - work you don't have to go crazy you
93:30 - don't have to go learn bubble sort
93:32 - and all these other ones but as long as
