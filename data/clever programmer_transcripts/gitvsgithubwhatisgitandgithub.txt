00:00 - git versus github that is the question a
00:03 - lot of you guys are confused about
00:04 - is it the same thing is it different how
00:07 - do i use them well
00:08 - i am here to clear it up for you are you
00:10 - ready let's get into it okay so check
00:12 - this out
00:13 - get my friends is git is a version
00:15 - control system that was created a long
00:16 - time ago
00:17 - in order to make developing easier think
00:19 - of it as like making versions of your
00:21 - application and saving versions of your
00:23 - application
00:24 - that is what you think about it right
00:25 - and git lives on your localhost machine
00:28 - so let's say for example you initialize
00:29 - a project
00:30 - you create your project okay you've got
00:31 - the folder you've got the files right
00:33 - you do get init inside your localhost
00:36 - environment inside your application and
00:38 - that initializes the git repository
00:40 - and so what happens now is that git now
00:43 - tracks
00:43 - all your files let's say you went ahead
00:45 - and you changed something in a file
00:47 - let's say you change the header for
00:48 - example in an html page whatever it
00:50 - might be it will go ahead and now
00:51 - track that every time you commit you
00:53 - commit one change okay
00:55 - let's say now you change something else
00:56 - you commit another change it keeps
00:58 - tracking the changes and so the reason
00:59 - why we do this is so that later on we
01:01 - can go back and refer to those changes
01:03 - or we could go back and revert to those
01:05 - changes if
01:06 - something was to go wrong okay now
01:08 - github was a website that was created
01:10 - also a long time ago
01:12 - to work directly with git okay meaning
01:14 - it's a basically a git repository but
01:17 - remotely meaning online that's what
01:19 - remotely means okay
01:21 - so now how do those two work the way
01:23 - they work is you
01:24 - let's say you have your project on git
01:25 - okay on your machine on your computer
01:28 - now what you do is you go ahead and
01:29 - upload that project that get
01:31 - git repository project onto github and
01:35 - the reason why we upload to github so
01:36 - later on
01:37 - your team or let's say your team can go
01:40 - ahead and actually
01:41 - look at that project and now pull that
01:43 - project into their
01:44 - machine into their computer meaning a
01:46 - lot of team members
01:48 - as you upload a project a lot of teams
01:50 - now are now able to see your changes
01:52 - oh come on so with github of your team
01:54 - members can now use it as well meaning
01:56 - you upload your project to github
01:58 - and now other team members do you work
02:00 - with can now download that project using
02:02 - something
02:03 - called git clone so you do get push to
02:05 - push it up to github then to git clone
02:08 - to pull it down forget it okay
02:10 - now another reason why you all might
02:11 - also use github of course is because
02:12 - let's say you don't want
02:13 - something to happen to your project it's
02:15 - like basically uploading uploading your
02:16 - project to the cloud so
02:18 - it's always there right and it just
02:19 - makes it so easy for you to visualize
02:21 - your project to see your
02:22 - files and for everybody to use it so
02:23 - that my friends is git versus github
02:25 - again just
02:26 - to understand give you a summary git is
02:28 - on your localhost machine it is on your
02:29 - computer
02:30 - github is on a website it's on a remote
02:33 - server so and then what you simply do is
02:35 - you use git get it push or whatever it
02:37 - might be
02:38 - to connect it to github and then so now
02:41 - your project is always connected to
02:42 - github and your project is always now
02:43 - either pushing or pulling from github
02:45 - but those are the two
02:46 - most important connections that you need
02:49 - to know and you
02:50 - need to make so yeah hopefully guys that
02:52 - clear this out just do not you know
02:53 - think of these as two the exact same
02:55 - things they're completely different
02:57 - but they do work very nicely together
02:58 - and that's why they were created so
03:00 - hopefully that was helpful if you did
03:02 - let us know down in the comments below
03:04 - of course go ahead and like this video
03:07 - because we do work hard and let's go
03:08 - ahead
03:09 - and smash that like button down below to
03:11 - defeat that youtube algorithm because
03:12 - the algorithm is so you know
03:15 - it's a trickster my friend you know so
03:16 - defeat the youtube algorithm and
03:18 - subscribe this channel of course so i
03:21 - hope you guys have a great day and i'll
03:22 - see you
03:23 - in the next video let's go
