00:00 - what the hell is a framework guys we
00:02 - always
00:03 - are asking like which framework do i
00:05 - learn is it like
00:06 - angular view react javascript's always
00:09 - evolving it's always changing
00:11 - so how do you know which one which which
00:12 - framework to start on and cause you like
00:14 - when you first entered this domain what
00:15 - was your thoughts on that
00:17 - i was very confused with all especially
00:19 - the web development
00:20 - it was just like i'm like let me just do
00:22 - python because python was just python
00:24 - and then web development was like
00:26 - view react angular this that that
00:30 - other thing and i'm like that seems like
00:32 - too much
00:33 - is going on yeah exactly there's a lot
00:36 - going on so we're gonna we're here to
00:37 - clear that up for you today guys on what
00:39 - you should focus all of your attention
00:41 - on
00:42 - so you're the most popular go ahead the
00:44 - most popular ones that we're going to
00:45 - cover guys are the first one you've
00:46 - probably heard of this angular it's
00:48 - google's uh framework right
00:50 - so you have google's framework it's very
00:52 - popular it grew quite a lot
00:55 - but it's sort of on the downward trend
00:57 - right now and then they had a view
00:59 - um i'm not actually sure because you
01:00 - know who actually came out with the view
01:01 - i'm not entirely sure i don't know who
01:03 - came out with
01:04 - you very lightweight uh library
01:06 - extremely sort of popular it's very
01:08 - opinionated
01:09 - um but it sort of surpassed angular and
01:12 - then the guys at facebook just came
01:14 - along and just like
01:15 - blew everyone's mind with like react
01:18 - like they came along i love this and
01:21 - they just took it to a whole new level
01:23 - you know like
01:24 - they um have we have have we gone to the
01:27 - next slide
01:28 - we're on react oh nice yeah awesome yeah
01:31 - so yeah this one
01:32 - guys this is by the guys over at
01:34 - facebook and this is obviously if you're
01:36 - not
01:36 - if you're new to the channel go ahead
01:38 - and check out the last few videos and
01:39 - we'll clear up what reactors
01:41 - yeah so yeah massive companies are using
01:44 - all three of these right now guys so
01:45 - you've got
01:46 - airbnb instagram ubereats dropbox using
01:48 - react
01:49 - you've got guardian upwork paypal sony
01:51 - using angular and then you've got
01:52 - alibaba and a bunch of others using vue
01:54 - but how do you know which one to choose
01:57 - from these so like
01:58 - what would you look at when you were
01:59 - when you would make this decision that's
02:01 - really important i
02:02 - honestly a few things i always look at
02:04 - which is why i looked at python as well
02:06 - i look for simplicity and ease of use
02:10 - i almost put that above so many other
02:12 - things
02:13 - just because i want to know how what's
02:16 - the learning curve can i
02:17 - pick it up fast and then i also look at
02:19 - how long is this thing here to stay
02:21 - so like is it popular is it picked up by
02:23 - a lot of people and then of course i
02:25 - want to look at like what companies
02:27 - you know are using it so when i see like
02:29 - i look at the guardian and i'm like
02:30 - that's cool but airbnb is like more
02:32 - badass you know like
02:33 - upwork is cute but instagram is really
02:35 - where it's at
02:37 - yeah exactly yeah so i mean
02:40 - i think all of them are being used by
02:42 - popular but i
02:44 - strive for simplicity and um something
02:47 - that's just
02:48 - you know popular and trending right now
02:52 - exactly so with that said guys we went
02:54 - ahead and checked out stack overflow
02:56 - and wanted to see what the most wanted
02:58 - framework was and you guys guessed it
03:00 - right
03:00 - whoa we just broke 1 thousand viewers
03:04 - concurrent we're over one thousand
03:06 - viewers on youtube you guys are
03:08 - absolutely amazing thank you so much
03:10 - thank you guys damn that is amazing
03:13 - let's keep it rolling so go ahead thank
03:15 - you guys so the number one most wanted
03:18 - framework
03:19 - right now is flying with react right so
03:21 - yeah at the top
03:22 - you've got react so guys there is no
03:25 - downfall right now to learn and react
03:26 - react is here to stay
03:28 - you can be sure for the next five years
03:29 - if you learn react you're going to have
03:31 - a job but you're going to have some kind
03:32 - of income
03:32 - that will come from that so definitely
03:34 - worth investing your time
03:36 - yep and it's the most wanted framework
03:39 - now if we go over here you guys can see
03:41 - react is just flying off and this is
03:43 - actually like
03:45 - look at this is the real download so
03:47 - this is not just some popularity this is
03:49 - literally download so take a look at
03:50 - this versus angular versus vue
03:53 - and honestly a lot of the reason with
03:54 - angular is because it's too
03:56 - um it's it forces you into a framework
04:00 - and it forces you to code a certain way
04:02 - whereas with react
04:04 - it's not a framework it's just a library
04:06 - it's super lightweight
04:07 - so it's plug and play and then it's also
04:09 - badass
04:10 - and you know you it's pretty much just
04:12 - like javascript under
04:14 - the hood yeah so next time you guys have
04:16 - that question
04:17 - should i let angular should i learn view
04:19 - think about this
04:20 - like visual right here like angular is
04:22 - going off the reactor going off the
04:23 - chart
04:26 - okay this visual right here okay i think
04:28 - you were talking about this visual
04:30 - because i'm like that other visual makes
04:32 - me not wanna
04:33 - you know if you guys love to drop a
04:37 - thumbs up
04:38 - warrior warrior says this is insane you
04:40 - guys are lit we're always lit somebody
04:41 - also said this is like watching two
04:43 - friends just kind of give us advice
04:45 - so that's cool hey i love that it is
04:47 - guys there's two friends just giving you
04:48 - guys advice
04:49 - amazing so what what is this over here
04:52 - right so yeah so we talked about reacts
04:54 - we're gonna dive a bit more into react
04:56 - guys so react is all about component
04:58 - based design
04:59 - and what that means guys is literally
05:01 - you go ahead and break a website down
05:03 - into different components the header the
05:05 - nav bar
05:06 - the body the text and all that goes in
05:08 - like the cards on amazon
05:09 - all of those things and you basically
05:11 - just reuse them right so it's literally
05:13 - like
05:13 - once you get the hang of that the reason
05:15 - why it's really really related guys it's
05:17 - actually super simple
05:18 - it's actually really easy to go ahead
05:19 - and reuse components so
05:21 - getting your head around the component
05:23 - based design is crucial
05:25 - now managing data and react like how
05:27 - does this work
05:28 - so when it comes to managing data and
05:31 - redux this is where people start to kind
05:33 - of lose their and start going crazy
05:35 - and this is why in our clones that we
05:38 - make like amazon clone where we use
05:40 - context api where we start to introduce
05:43 - the idea of redux
05:44 - and we built another tutorial i think
05:46 - with spotify where we use
05:48 - context api so this is another concept
05:51 - which introduces things like data layers
05:53 - and you needing to understand that which
05:55 - is super powerful and super valuable
05:57 - once you learn it
05:58 - and the step-by-step process of learning
06:00 - is learn context api
06:02 - first and then get into redux and is the
06:04 - easiest way to do it send me your
06:06 - thoughts on this
06:07 - exactly what cause you said pretty much
06:09 - so guys well the minute the minute you
06:10 - kind of hear about redux and you look at
06:12 - tutorials for redux
06:13 - this is your reaction it's pretty much
06:14 - like oh my god like it's kind of
06:16 - freaking me out and stuff
06:17 - so all we're gonna say here is pretty
06:18 - much like kazi said go ahead learn the
06:21 - react context api
06:22 - first learn that pattern and then
06:24 - picking out redux is kind of easy so
06:26 - it's going to it's going to be a lot
06:27 - simpler than as if you were just jumping
06:29 - straight into
06:30 - redux for the first time so the next one
06:32 - yeah react context
06:33 - api is going to be a lot easier to learn
06:35 - and pick up um
06:37 - and if you are interested in the builds
06:39 - that we done we actually went ahead and
06:40 - done that so
06:41 - you can definitely use those as
06:42 - reference yep and you you know we have a
06:44 - free training for you guys
06:46 - profit with javascript free training so
06:48 - you guys can go ahead and
06:50 - sign up for it at any time we have a

07:00 - ahead and sign up for it because it just
07:02 - gives you the exact roadmap
07:04 - to you know here we're diving deep into
07:07 - the front end developer guide in your
07:09 - roadmap in that one we're talking about
07:10 - how are you going to go from your
07:12 - zero dollars to making a hundred
07:14 - thousand dollars
07:15 - whether you do that in one year three
07:17 - years or five years it's really the road
07:19 - map
07:19 - to learning the coding skills and the
07:21 - practicality of
07:22 - your first hundred thousand dollars so i
07:25 - put that
07:25 - in the description below click that link
07:28 - and then sign up for that
07:29 - training it's freaking awesome
07:32 - definitely go check that out guys free
07:33 - value so
07:34 - definitely worth checking out now i
07:36 - included this one because
07:37 - i have a lot of people who do ask about
07:39 - something called mob x right i had a
07:41 - question about it before
07:42 - uh is it basically another uh
07:44 - opinionated version of like
07:46 - managing data within a reactor honestly
07:48 - my my viewpoint here is if anyone has
07:50 - this question
07:50 - go ahead and use react context api and
07:52 - then redux if you want to do this
07:54 - it's just kind of a cool thing to learn
07:55 - but honestly if you want to land the job
07:57 - redux is the way to go got it
08:01 - and now check out the live bills that we
08:03 - have free
08:04 - on youtube all right so bruce buffer is
08:07 - endorsing us apparently and over here
08:09 - you can see we got the zoom clone i mean
08:11 - i know it's really hard for you guys to
08:13 - see but
08:13 - we got the zoom clone that we made
08:15 - recently we made a spotify clone for you
08:18 - guys
08:18 - we made the tick tock clone uh that's
08:22 - at you know in six days we have over 117
08:25 - 000 people watched that one
08:26 - and a lot of them built it out we built
08:29 - a youtube clone for you guys you can see
08:31 - the exact front end design for youtube
08:34 - and then we also did the tinder clone
08:36 - and then
08:37 - a bunch of more stuff so go ahead and
08:40 - guys like that's
08:41 - all there for free on youtube so make
08:42 - sure you get value from that as well
08:45 - exactly and guys if you were if you've
08:47 - watched any of these and you found value
08:48 - from that just
08:49 - all we ask is you smash the thumbs up
08:51 - button and that's enough for us
08:52 - we're to break the break the thumbs up
08:55 - button
08:56 - exactly now okay
