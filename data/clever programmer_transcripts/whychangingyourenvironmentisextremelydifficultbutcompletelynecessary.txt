00:02 - guys how's it going
00:04 - this is Kazi from clever programmer
00:06 - knockoff in this video we're going to
00:10 - talk about some a lot of stuff
00:12 - [Music]
00:19 - [Applause]
00:24 - hey you what is up how's it going missus
00:27 - Kazi from clever programmer calm with
00:30 - tons in with what stuff calm how we said
00:33 - what's up what alright my boy over here
00:38 - just flew in from Chicago and one of the
00:41 - things I want to talk about in this
00:42 - video is the ability to make a change
00:46 - and to actually act on it and then to go
00:48 - through with it
00:50 - because of the record this is my first
00:51 - time finding it out yes yes he didn't
00:54 - even know where I actually make this
00:55 - video so there we go
00:56 - one of the things that a lot of us
00:58 - struggle with is how do we actually
01:00 - change our environment we hear it in
01:02 - psychology books we hear 20 Robbins talk
01:05 - about it or you know whoever your
01:07 - personal development whatever guru is or
01:09 - self-help book they'll say change your
01:11 - environment go somewhere else but a lot
01:13 - of people they'll say that I have my
01:15 - home somewhere right
01:17 - you'll associate a placement home you
01:19 - have friends there you have
01:20 - relationships there so how do you break
01:22 - out of that to go into a new environment
01:24 - and how do you make those tough
01:25 - decisions how does it actually feel like
01:28 - today he just actually flew in right now
01:31 - okay I literally me and my friend most
01:33 - of what we just picked him up from the
01:34 - airport so
01:44 - what we'll be able to hear you know when
01:47 - I'm talking with him you'll feel you
01:49 - know whether I don't know if there's
01:50 - pain I don't know if he how he's feeling
01:52 - about it but you'll not only be able to
01:54 - hear that in his voice in his eyes see
01:57 - it but you'll also be able to understand
01:59 - how he made this decision to do this
02:01 - because like if he can make this
02:03 - decision maybe it can inspire you to you
02:06 - know you're in some other country or in
02:07 - some other city and you know something
02:09 - that you need to do and you need to
02:10 - change your environment whether it's you
02:12 - flying out and going somewhere else or
02:13 - changing your environment of friends
02:15 - it's a hard thing but uh hopefully after
02:18 - watching today's video it'll make it a
02:20 - little bit easier for you to actually
02:21 - overcome it let me ask you bro go shoot
02:25 - oh shoot
02:25 - I'm here what caused you first of all to
02:29 - want to fly out here to LA and not stay
02:33 - in say Chicago well it's all about
02:35 - progress you know like number one thing
02:39 - that I think everybody should focus on
02:43 - is always like moving forward in life
02:44 - and self-awareness is really important
02:49 - so for me I have noticed that you know
02:52 - when I was in Chicago I wasn't doing as
02:55 - much you know I was I was just just
02:57 - doing enough just being okay with being
03:00 - average and you know like reading like
03:03 - books like 10x Grant Cardone like at
03:05 - mine let and all these guys you know you
03:08 - can listen to them you can like read
03:11 - their books you can like listen to their
03:14 - podcasts and do all that but at the end
03:16 - of the day it's like you know listening
03:18 - and learning is fun but that that
03:21 - doesn't mean anything you know like
03:22 - until you actually like take action
03:25 - towards whatever goal you're working on
03:27 - so for me like I'm nowhere close to
03:30 - anywhere like of my goals like and like
03:33 - nothing close to it any of them like
03:36 - health wealth family relationships
03:39 - everything okay so you know it's very
03:42 - stagnant again like it all depends on
03:45 - you you know it's not because of
03:46 - California it's not because of freaking
03:48 - LA
03:49 - to be honest like I feel like Ellie's
03:51 - over height but but it's more about like
03:56 - people you know and I know that this guy
03:59 - right here anytime we're together okay
04:02 - every time and any time in the history
04:04 - of us being friends holy history of
04:07 - being friends the deepest dream history
04:10 - here you know every time like we've had
04:13 - fun and we get done you know like we we
04:17 - make like leaps and bounds of progress
04:19 - like when most people they work on
04:22 - something hard and they're progressing
04:24 - their progression is like linear right
04:27 - linear like when we're working together
04:30 - are our progressions like freakin
04:32 - x-squared like literally exponential
04:35 - yeah that's that's really why I mean
04:38 - it's it's tough you know it's tough like
04:41 - moving out from from your apartment from
04:44 - your house that you have lived in for so
04:46 - long with friends around that you're
04:49 - you're you've been comfortable with you
04:51 - know that you're comfortable with the
04:52 - routine that you're comfortable with but
04:55 - you know comfort is often not what you
04:58 - need you know from for me it's it was so
05:02 - easy to push it off like I pushed it off
05:05 - for so long like so many months I
05:06 - suppose like move out like glass
05:26 - octo-octo-octopus ultros so I just
05:45 - closed my tap whatever whatever I was
05:47 - working on I just command space c-h
05:49 - enter and command T and you were united
05:53 - and sure everything's autocomplete it
05:56 - and I just booked my ticket you know I
05:58 - just booked my ticket because I know
05:59 - this is the right thing to do because I
06:01 - know that just coming here and being
06:03 - with this guy right that flex right
06:06 - before you did that it's getting jacked
06:09 - you know being jacked but but you know
06:13 - just like lifting I know I'm gonna like
06:16 - I'm gonna hit my lips now I'm not gonna
06:19 - like miss my days because of some some
06:23 - random excuse or because you know I
06:26 - couldn't make it to the gym or because I
06:28 - had to do some video or whatever it is
06:31 - like cuz you know this guy just knows
06:34 - I'm lying like anybody else I can kind
06:37 - of fool them you know this guy knows bro
06:40 - come on bro
06:42 - come on bro I'll call you that's some
06:44 - bullsh some so yeah that's a that's
06:46 - that's really it you know just the right
06:48 - thing to do I honestly feel like if
06:52 - people are true friends with other
06:54 - people they should call them out when to
06:57 - see them lacking in some way right
06:59 - it doesn't mean you lecture them it
07:01 - doesn't mean you all like are a teacher
07:04 - or whatever but like if you see your
07:06 - friend lacking right in some way let's
07:08 - say your friend is not taking care of
07:10 - their health as well as this should and
07:12 - you can maybe help them then it's your
07:14 - responsibility to kind of give them that
07:16 - push and your friend should give you
07:19 - that push to when you need it right like
07:21 - for example for you know I'll give you a
07:23 - business example for clever program or
07:26 - the profitable programmer the the course
07:28 - I have I needed to make a sales page for
07:32 - that that describes the benefits of that
07:34 - product to offer my story and it's hard
07:37 - like writing those sales pages is very
07:40 - very hard and it takes a very long time
07:43 - and I never wanted to really do it and I
07:45 - did everything I could to avoid it and
07:47 - then you came a few weeks ago to the
07:50 - lame and it allowed like he called he's
07:55 - like hey you know why isn't your sales
07:56 - page ready like you should actually kind
07:58 - of be working on it and then we started
08:00 - talking about it and I started thinking
08:01 - and thinking and it went from like a
08:03 - one-page sales page or one page offer to
08:07 - Oh a 46 page sales page like you know it
08:12 - inspired me to like just put in a
08:14 - ridiculous amount of work and and then
08:17 - when people see it now they're like wow
08:18 - this you know if it's not the right
08:20 - course for them it's very easy for them
08:22 - to tell but if it is the right course
08:24 - for them now it's incredibly easy to
08:26 - tell and they're like wow I can see how
08:28 - this course works I can see how it's
08:30 - different I'm in and a lot of that
08:33 - happened because I was honestly inspired
08:35 - and motivated and when you were here you
08:37 - felt you were motivated to add more
08:40 - modules put in more work right for your
08:42 - course and your products if you guys
08:45 - don't know him what's your channel tell
08:47 - them what's dev Tom
08:49 - so what's dev calm right so he's running
08:51 - that YouTube channel and he's helping
08:55 - those people become front-end developers
08:57 - and he has a course on that and so it
08:59 - inspired him to just like put in more
09:01 - work but you know business is one thing
09:04 - and it's one aspect of your life but
09:06 - then there are many other aspects of
09:08 - your life right like if you every time I
09:09 - would sit down and I would put down the
09:11 - values I have and this is something
09:13 - really really important okay that I want
09:15 - you to understand when I put down my
09:16 - values I always put health first then I
09:19 - put business then I put the
09:21 - relationships and then let's say I put
09:23 - experiences okay now that's what my
09:26 - value system says right except I'm a
09:30 - liar because I'm not sleeping I'm not
09:33 - getting enough sleep I have poor sleep
09:36 - I'm not eating the right amounts of food
09:39 - I'm not eating as many times I shouldn't
09:41 - be eating I'm not going to the gym I'm
09:44 - not I'm doing a lot of sedentary stuff
09:48 - like I'm sitting in front of a computer
09:50 - writing emails creating new content and
09:53 - all that stuff is great but like if
09:55 - health is truly my number one priority I
09:57 - am a liar because my actions aren't see
10:01 - if I meet you and I have to believe
10:05 - between what you say and what you do
10:07 - I'll always believe what you do
10:10 - and if what you do isn't in line with
10:13 - what you say then you essentially are a
10:14 - liar right but I had to look within
10:17 - myself and so I saw that my health goals
10:20 - weren't on point and I'm lucky I'm a
10:21 - liar and that and my business goals were
10:23 - kind of on track so I didn't feel really
10:26 - like a liar in business but you know
10:28 - when it came to relationships or certain
10:30 - other things even experiences I felt
10:32 - like I wasn't really moving forward in
10:35 - that direction and there is something to
10:37 - be said about like what actually makes
10:39 - you happy you know if you're actually
10:40 - happy you know there's there's this like
10:43 - fine line there because how would you
10:46 - describe the difference between being
10:47 - complacent and being actually happy do
10:50 - you know what I mean right like for
10:51 - example when you told me that you know
10:53 - your you were like you figured out a
10:55 - certain way you're like hey I can do
10:56 - this I can make money just by doing this
10:58 - certain thing and it almost made you
11:01 - feel like you were being you know
11:03 - complacent or happy exactly and one
11:06 - thing I want to say on that is the way I
11:08 - kind of define it is like look a lot of
11:11 - you like if you're watching this there's
11:13 - a lot of potential inside of you and if
11:16 - you're doing something way below what
11:19 - your max level is then I honestly think
11:22 - you're being complacent right you don't
11:26 - have to define happiness with like you
11:28 - not working because we can be working
11:30 - and be happy right like honestly right
11:33 - now I'm making this video I mean working
11:35 - working really makes you happy when you
11:37 - don't work or don't do anything and it
11:40 - just it just like drives you crazy it
11:43 - it's not like like a parent like you
11:47 - know like black and white it's but it
11:49 - just like slowly kills you like it's
11:51 - very subtle and you don't like notice it
11:54 - right away but you know you you don't
11:57 - put in that action one day and then that
11:59 - did one day turns into two days and then
12:01 - three days four days and then you know
12:03 - weeks months and then you look back and
12:06 - you just feel
12:08 - det you just feel down your your your
12:11 - confidence is down you're like
12:13 - everything is down and at that point
12:17 - anything you touch it's not gonna really
12:20 - end well right so keep going keep going
12:23 - no a hundred percent I want to like know
12:26 - that pain that you felt right or if
12:29 - there was any and I think there was pain
12:32 - of one just leaving you know are the
12:35 - memories just like walk through that
12:37 - actual process see if you can kind of
12:38 - tap into that because people watching I
12:40 - feel like you know they go through that
12:42 - stuff I got and people feel like there's
12:44 - no people feel like you and I or maybe
12:46 - you like don't feel anything you know
12:48 - and it's important for them to
12:50 - understand like hey if you're one just
12:52 - because I'm on YouTube doesn't mean I
12:53 - don't have those same emotions or just
12:55 - because he's on YouTube doesn't mean he
12:57 - doesn't have those same emotions I kind
13:00 - of bounce back pretty quickly so once I
13:02 - came to Cali LA you know I look at the
13:04 - weather just look at the Sun man just
13:07 - look at look at this Beach I mean it's
13:09 - it's it's beautiful
13:10 - you know so when you when you're in a
13:13 - when here in a place like this I mean
13:16 - it's kind of hard to you know feel down
13:18 - now being that being said you know when
13:21 - I was in Chicago and actually making
13:22 - that decision it was really hard because
13:24 - with that apartment with that house with
13:27 - that environment with that city a lot of
13:30 - things not really things like memories
13:33 - were attached to them
13:34 - you know like and it's not like crazy
13:37 - party or crazy thing that I miss or I
13:42 - you know I was getting sad over or
13:44 - whatever it was mostly like those little
13:46 - subtle things you know like going going
13:49 - up to my friend and saying hey want to
13:51 - get some drinks or you know going to the
13:53 - bar or just playing playing video games
13:57 - like don't start what we would do is
13:58 - just like close the room set the air
14:04 - conditioning on like perfect temperature
14:06 - go to the gas station right before okay
14:09 - plan everything out
14:10 - you'd get water would make sure we have
14:12 - water we'll make sure we have Red Bull
14:14 - or monster so then we can play for like
14:16 - hours and hours
14:19 - and then it will get in close the door
14:22 - in that perfect way like sometimes you
14:25 - know we don't want to close it all the
14:26 - way so that the room doom doesn't get
14:28 - too hot because there's multiple
14:30 - computers running like in a small room
14:32 - like three four people you know so and
14:35 - those things you know those memories
14:38 - those little memories like and us like
14:40 - sitting in and like him sitting on my
14:43 - bed and then I'm like on my chair and
14:45 - we're deciding to go skydiving for the
14:50 - very first time like in four days we're
14:53 - like all right let's do it
14:54 - and those things are or what I miss you
14:59 - know it's not it's not so much of like
15:02 - the city or other things it's just it's
15:06 - just a lot of memories attached with it
15:07 - and you know it's and it's not it's not
15:10 - even a big deal like I know it's not
15:12 - even a big deal because right now what
15:14 - I'm what I was feeling because right now
15:17 - I don't feel anything right I know this
15:20 - is good you know like I know that what
15:23 - like I feel peace right now I'm at like
15:26 - my heart's at peace and I feel really
15:29 - really peaceful because I know I've made
15:32 - the right decision even though it's hard
15:34 - to make that decision right to moving
15:36 - like to move out and doing all that like
15:38 - just thinking about it is like oh man I
15:42 - gotta do this I gotta do that I got to
15:44 - do the paperwork I got to do this I got
15:46 - you got to move it move out where if
15:48 - what are you gonna do with the car what
15:49 - are you gonna do with this you know what
15:51 - are you gonna tell your parents like so
15:53 - many logistical issues and you know it
15:56 - that's how I was thinking about it for
15:59 - so long but deep down I knew that you
16:04 - know all I needed was an avalanche and
16:07 - by that I mean like you know I'm I'm
16:09 - someone who needs a lot of push to do
16:12 - something you know real quick Steve
16:14 - Pavlina you guys should check out the
16:16 - blog he calls it plotters versus
16:19 - bursters Bursar's are are
16:23 - fascinators our chronic procrastinators
16:26 - and I am a bursar I wait till the
16:28 - deadline is there or I'm about to fail
16:30 - school or I'm about to get like my
16:32 - parents are about to dump me or
16:33 - something and that's when I get that
16:35 - burst of energy and I do something and
16:38 - plotters on the other hand are they just
16:41 - plod along they don't need a lot of push
16:43 - a lot of energy and they just do it
16:45 - there's nothing bad between the two but
16:47 - how I describe Mustapha is that his
16:48 - power is plotting because he can start
16:51 - something and you can just keep going
16:53 - like when he goes to the gym
16:54 - he's zero motivation and he like he did
16:57 - it one day they're always kind of cool
16:58 - and then just like never miss right
17:01 - right whereas I need to constantly every
17:03 - day before I get into the gym and spent
17:05 - three hours actually building up
17:08 - momentum or watching something to just
17:10 - keep that fire going so definitely check
17:12 - it out by Steve Pavlina great great
17:16 - article you want to continue or thought
17:18 - yeah avalanche and you know I'm a big
17:21 - procrastinator burster right so I need
17:26 - an avalanche okay that's that's how I
17:28 - usually picture it when I see the
17:30 - avalanche
17:30 - I still don't do anything okay if it's
17:34 - like up there like coming from the top
17:37 - of the mountain I'm still like I got
17:38 - time you know most people okay since
17:42 - they're like they're human and they can
17:45 - think right
17:47 - they're like holy [ __ ] an avalanche is
17:49 - coming got a run
17:51 - got it got to take action right me no I
17:55 - still got time to like you know prepare
17:58 - a bonfire get myself warm get a jacket
18:01 - on eat some like get something to eat
18:04 - Tilikum right still calm methodical and
18:08 - I only move when the avalanche is like
18:13 - right here like right right behind me
18:16 - okay it has to be that close for me to
18:18 - take action so for me without too much
18:23 - of about the Avalanche really what I'm
18:26 - talking about what the Avalanche is that
18:27 - when I when I was making this decision
18:29 - even though it's really hard I didn't
18:32 - have an avalanche I didn't have anybody
18:35 - pushing me so what I had to do was
18:37 - create my own Avalanche so what I did is
18:41 - I just bought the ticket I had no clue
18:44 - that I was coming here like a few days
18:47 - ago no idea at all I was initially
18:50 - planning to like come here in the next
18:53 - few months right just like back in
18:55 - October in a few months but I knew it's
18:59 - not gonna happen and I just had to make
19:02 - my own Avalanche and guess what like
19:04 - moving out took literally less than a
19:07 - day albeit like my friend helped me out
19:10 - a lot but you know less than a day and
19:13 - was done like cleaning like all my stuff
19:17 - were out I fixed like oh I did all my
19:21 - paperwork in less than a day and it just
19:24 - got done in like two days
19:25 - and then I had a date left over just to
19:27 - relax and then I just came here note to
19:31 - the people who are bursters like us just
19:34 - give yourself deadlines put yourself in
19:36 - a situation where you're just forced
19:38 - forced to do something so for example
19:41 - for Tenzin it was just booking the
19:43 - ticket to come to LA you know or booking
19:46 - the ticket and then it's like okay
19:48 - because before like he said he wanted to
19:50 - take you know oh yeah just give me a
19:53 - week or another week or another and then
19:55 - it just it's very comforting it's
19:57 - relaxing
19:57 - it's something that you know and it it's
20:00 - a cycle just continues and the day after
20:02 - day passes you never really feel like
20:03 - you have to do anything but then when
20:05 - you give yourself a deadline you you
20:07 - feel like you have to do it whereas like
20:09 - a plotter he would just like start
20:12 - packing like a one item a day and just
20:14 - like consistently just keep packing and
20:16 - like you know exact week he'll be done
20:18 - packing there was zero pressure and then
20:20 - he'll just be like on his way okay so
20:22 - how would you describe this right you
20:24 - like you how are you feeling about in
20:26 - terms of your growth in every aspect of
20:29 - your level did you feel it was growing
20:31 - or did it feel like it was lacking and
20:35 - if it was why do you think that that was
20:37 - the case well definitely not growing at
20:43 - least the level that that I want the
20:46 - level of growth that I want nowhere
20:49 - close to it so it's more of again like I
20:52 - said like I mentioned earlier it's more
20:54 - about more of like being average and
20:56 - being okay with it that's what scared me
20:58 - the most
20:59 - above all you know just because in the
21:04 - beginning when you don't do something
21:06 - you feel bad right
21:08 - you miss a mislead missed a day in the
21:10 - gym or you know you don't do something
21:13 - or you procrastinate one thing you feel
21:15 - bad about that but once you do it again
21:18 - and again and again what starts
21:22 - happening is that
21:25 - you don't feel bad anymore at one point
21:29 - you just stop feeling bad and then you
21:32 - start rationalizing you're like hmm I
21:36 - mean finance is good life is good at
21:42 - least I don't have diabetes at least I
21:44 - don't have diabetes at least at least my
21:48 - PR was 265 at one point squat at least
21:53 - you know and CeCe I'm not dead right so
21:59 - you start rationalizing and you don't
22:01 - feel bad anymore and you're okay with
22:03 - being stagnant
22:05 - that's pretty complacent right that guy
22:08 - that's what got me scared the most and
22:10 - you know I was contemplating and
22:12 - thinking about that for so long and it
22:15 - still gives me the heebie-jeebies like
22:16 - it's just like like just thinking about
22:19 - that so Wow I was in that state you know
22:23 - so so when you're in that state you know
22:26 - again like I'm I'm kind of happy because
22:30 - again I was aware enough to know that I
22:35 - was in that state so hence I made the
22:40 - decision to come here right so but you
22:44 - know again it's it's not just coming
22:46 - here that's going to change everything I
22:49 - just know that when oh when I come here
22:51 - and I'm with this guy when I'm with
22:54 - people around like people around me who
22:58 - have the same vision as me people around
22:59 - me who think the same way that I do
23:02 - back back home you know even though I
23:04 - have really good friends even though I
23:06 - my life was you know a lot of people
23:09 - would want my life to be honest with you
23:11 - just not do a lot of work and just do
23:15 - the things that you want like binge
23:17 - watch anime or binge watch like your
23:19 - favorite show for days on end or you
23:23 - know play video games anywhere you want
23:25 - any anytime you want right a lot of
23:28 - people want that but for me that's
23:30 - that's not my ultimate life right that's
23:34 - not my like highest level of
23:37 - I don't know like the ultimate life you
23:40 - know I what I want is balance I want all
23:44 - the fun I want like playing video games
23:46 - I want all that but I also want no work
23:50 - right
23:51 - also on I also have my business goals I
23:55 - also have my health goals and you know
23:59 - the the harsh true story is that you
24:05 - know I'm nowhere near where I want to be
24:08 - so that's that's pretty much it
24:11 - and yeah real quick if you had to define
24:18 - like how confident you feel at this
24:19 - point how confident would you put
24:22 - yourself in terms of what just overall
24:25 - like do you feel more confident like if
24:28 - for example compared yourself to like
24:30 - let's say a year ago year and a half ago
24:32 - to now do you feel like you have you
24:34 - feel less confident or more confident I
24:38 - feel like confidence comes from your
24:42 - work ethic so like I said earlier what I
24:47 - was saying about when you keep when you
24:49 - miss something and when you just
24:52 - procrastinate after a long time you you
24:55 - lose confidence that's that's that's
24:58 - 100% and this is right now it's
25:01 - definitely not the level definitely not
25:04 - my highest point okay I've had I've had
25:08 - days where I where I thought I could do
25:11 - anything okay
25:14 - I'm nowhere close to that but just
25:17 - coming here just be making that decision
25:20 - maybe more confident
25:22 - like if you just cut if you just
25:24 - compared me to like three days ago and
25:27 - versus now me you'd be like what what
25:31 - just happened did he like take drugs or
25:33 - something there is he on cocaine or
25:35 - something it's it's that big of a
25:38 - difference you know it's like these
25:39 - small actions it's not about like making
25:42 - huge you
25:44 - you know moving out and that might look
25:47 - like something huge or whatever but it's
25:49 - not really you know it's you just I just
25:52 - bought a ticket and just came here
25:53 - that's it but it's the little action
25:56 - when it accumulates over a period of
25:59 - time weeks months that makes you more
26:03 - confident you know 100% I want to take a
26:05 - second here to talk about like we're
26:08 - self-esteem and confidence actually
26:10 - comes from so a lot of the times people
26:12 - think confidence comes from like
26:13 - somebody skydives and that builds their
26:15 - confidence and somebody goes
26:17 - roller-coaster and that builds their
26:18 - confidence and they watch horror stuff
26:20 - or go to haunted houses like do
26:22 - something dangerous and that builds up
26:24 - their confidence well that might be true
26:26 - at a superficial level temporarily you
26:28 - feel in that state of high but that's
26:29 - not actually your deep inner confidence
26:31 - it doesn't build there a lot of the
26:34 - times your confidence builds from an ed
26:36 - my let talks about this and Tony Robbins
26:38 - talks about this is your self values and
26:41 - your self ideal when those are in line
26:43 - okay where your actions are in line with
26:46 - yourself ideal that's where actual
26:48 - confidence comes from okay so for
26:49 - example if you see your ideal self in a
26:53 - great health great shape and you take
26:57 - action every day to take care of your
26:59 - body take care of how you look put time
27:02 - into it you'll start being a little bit
27:05 - more confident because you're trying to
27:07 - do it for your health and every day
27:09 - right another thing that I'd my let
27:11 - talks about is a private how many
27:14 - private promises you keep with yourself
27:16 - okay so let's say that your goal is
27:18 - health and you're going to the gym
27:19 - that's you keeping a private promise
27:22 - with yourself consistently you say I'm
27:24 - gonna show up at 5 a.m. or 10 a.m.
27:26 - somewhere and you showing up at that
27:28 - time it's not just honesty what's
27:31 - actually happening is that you're
27:32 - practicing keeping a promise with
27:34 - yourself and the more of those promises
27:36 - actually keep with yourself it builds
27:38 - proof in your brain that you are not a
27:42 - liar and what you say you actually get
27:44 - done and that's why people are confident
27:46 - you can see in their eyes that they're
27:48 - confident their eyes have like a little
27:50 - bit of a glint in the shore of
27:51 - themselves right it's that and
27:54 - regardless of how you feel
27:56 - what your emotions are like you know I
27:59 - talked about this you know I feel like a
28:01 - lot of people are just like leaf in the
28:02 - wind they go about their day like how it
28:04 - feels right so now anything through
28:06 - dilly-dallying there's just like a leave
28:07 - they're like Oh like right now I'm just
28:09 - gonna like walk or right now I'm just
28:11 - gonna like go to this party and have fun
28:14 - and I'm gonna like go to the talk to
28:18 - this one person like three hours and
28:20 - like there's nothing wrong with any of
28:22 - those things but because none of the
28:24 - actions that took took them somewhere
28:26 - closer to their self ideal right so for
28:28 - yours for example your self ideal might
28:30 - be fearless like you wanna have less
28:31 - fear it might be out you want to be a
28:33 - leader you want to be more you want to
28:37 - be powerful you want to be strong you
28:38 - want to have more money you know and so
28:41 - if you do nothing throughout the day
28:43 - that moves you closer to any of those
28:44 - things at the end of the day you're not
28:47 - gonna feel very confident in yourself
28:48 - right because every time you're like
28:51 - goddamnit
28:51 - I keep saying I want those things and I
28:54 - never have them and so then you get more
28:56 - and more lack of confidence and that's
29:00 - where it truly comes from you know the
29:01 - reason why Conor McGregor or Zlatan
29:03 - Ibrahimovic are so confident is not cuz
29:05 - they won all those fights that's not
29:07 - actually where his confidence was built
29:09 - okay why is he still confident than
29:12 - after losing to Nate Diaz his confidence
29:14 - should just vanish in thin air the
29:16 - reason is that every day he tells
29:18 - himself he's gonna come to 5:00 a.m.
29:20 - right the reason why Conor McGregor says
29:22 - work ethic my confidence comes from my
29:25 - work ethic that's it
29:26 - I know the work on--put name he goes
29:28 - work ethic and why is work I think is
29:30 - what gives him contrast every time he
29:32 - tells himself I'm gonna show up to the
29:33 - gym at 5:00 a.m. and I'm gonna you know
29:35 - work till 7 a.m. and he just does it day
29:37 - in and day out regardless of how he
29:39 - feels whether he's sick or not whether
29:40 - he's injured or not he every single day
29:43 - whether he goes on a vacation whether
29:45 - he's with family whether he's whatever
29:47 - he'll find us a way to get it done
29:49 - that's where his confidence comes from a
29:52 - lot of the times people think confidence
29:54 - comes from him winning a lot of the
29:56 - times people think rich people's
29:57 - confidence comes from from them making
29:59 - money they're like if I had this much
30:01 - money I'd be that confident know that
30:05 - person was that confident before he got
30:07 - the money then he
30:09 - the money right that person with that
30:11 - confident before he had a 13-0 record in
30:14 - UFC and then you got the 13-0 record in
30:17 - the UFC okay so your self-esteem and
30:21 - your confidence actually comes from the
30:23 - private promises you make yourself and
30:24 - how in line you are with your values
30:28 - right so you know that sometimes some of
30:32 - the times the reason why there are times
30:35 - where I feel like less confident
30:36 - whatever right but at this point in my
30:38 - life right now I feel pretty motivated
30:40 - and overall I'm not at my peak of
30:43 - motivation but I feel pretty motivated
30:45 - and I'm moving in a lot of the
30:48 - directions where the the values that I
30:50 - have now there are a lot of things that
30:53 - I need to improve and you know kind of
30:56 - 10x how grant cardone would say but you
30:58 - know I have I still feel like I have
31:00 - that motivation like if you zoom into my
31:01 - eyes right now just like zoom in right
31:03 - now just look into my eyes and if you're
31:06 - watching this video right now just
31:08 - comment below and just let me know like
31:10 - did these eyes they feel like I don't
31:13 - have drive I don't have ambition or how
31:15 - did it make you feel when I'm looking at
31:17 - you how does it actually make you feel
31:18 - maybe give me some goose bump you know
31:21 - and you know and I want to talk about
31:23 - this like you can honestly see in a
31:25 - person's eyes how their drive is how
31:28 - that ambition is and how happy with
31:30 - their with their life right
31:32 - they might superficially say oh I'm
31:34 - happy in my life I'm happy with
31:36 - everything that I have but it might just
31:38 - be like a broken record that they just
31:40 - keep regurgitating but they don't
31:42 - actually believe in it right they don't
31:44 - actually believe in it's something that
31:45 - they just say but I feel like you can
31:48 - tell a lot by a person's eyes and the
31:50 - scariest thing for me to see is when you
31:53 - have somebody who's talented when
31:54 - somebody who can achieve so much when
31:57 - somebody has incredible amount of
31:59 - potential but then they go through the
32:00 - system or they go through social
32:02 - conditioning or what other people like
32:03 - kind of bring them down because you
32:05 - either have anchors around your engines
32:07 - as Darren Hardy says and compound the
32:09 - fact and if other people are bringing
32:11 - you down what ends up happening is
32:13 - you'll have these really amazing people
32:14 - they're talented they're amazing and
32:16 - then you see the
32:18 - you see the glint in their eyes kind of
32:21 - lonely disappear so slowly go away and
32:24 - they're alive but they're actually dead
32:27 - way before they're physically gonna die
32:30 - and that's like that's honestly one of
32:34 - the things that scares me the most and I
32:36 - see that in you know a lot of people you
32:39 - know you look around go to you can even
32:42 - go to like a place like coffee bean or
32:43 - Starbucks and you can see they're people
32:46 - who are working there some of them they
32:48 - still have ambition Drive want to do a
32:49 - lot of stuff in latter lives and there's
32:51 - some that you can actually look into
32:53 - their eyes and it's almost like they
32:54 - have given up and they're resigned to
32:57 - life okay so when those kind of things
33:02 - are happening you know let it be a
33:03 - trigger for you and kind of a red flag
33:05 - for you that your motivation and those
33:09 - things you know if they're if they're
33:10 - going away that has to be a red flag you
33:12 - have to kind of immediately change that
33:14 - it's equivalent of like drowning the
33:17 - only thing is that you don't actually
33:19 - feel like that it actually feels really
33:22 - comfortable right actually feels really
33:25 - nice and cozy and fuzzy and not only
33:29 - warm know like being complacent being
33:32 - happy with you know what I mean or like
33:34 - your ambitions leaving your your Drive
33:36 - leaving you it's not like you don't feel
33:38 - like you're drowning you know what I
33:39 - mean you kind of feel like it's
33:42 - everything is okay everything is just
33:44 - fine
33:45 - everything is just awesome but it's kind
33:46 - of like quicksand you just keep going in
33:49 - going in going in
33:50 - you don't realize it right away but you
33:52 - you're gonna realize it maybe you know a
33:55 - few weeks months or if it's like really
33:59 - bad then maybe years yeah but yeah
34:03 - that's that's not a place it's not a
34:05 - really good place to be in yeah scary
34:08 - place to be in so here's what we would
34:12 - like to wrap this up as if you're
34:15 - watching this so far right there are a
34:17 - lot of things that we shared and a lot
34:19 - of emotions that we shared but what I
34:22 - want you to leave with is not a feeling
34:23 - of confusion and overwhelmed but rather
34:27 - one of your motivated and excited no
34:30 - matter where you are if you have Drive
34:32 - in a mission right now keep that fire
34:34 - burning but the message to you is don't
34:37 - be around other people who kill that
34:39 - fire like you need to stay somewhere
34:41 - where that fire keeps burning right I
34:43 - like add my light sets if you are a
34:45 - hundred and ten degree and somebody
34:48 - around you is eighty degree or they'll
34:49 - warm up to you and they'll become ninety
34:51 - degree or a hundred degree or right but
34:53 - if you're around just a lot of like
34:56 - fifty degrees then eventually your
34:58 - temperature will go down so you want to
35:00 - be mindful of that if you're ambitious
35:02 - you're driven and all those things and
35:03 - if you feel like you don't have that
35:05 - same ambition that drive you're like hey
35:07 - man I don't really feel that what is
35:09 - that
35:10 - then then not maybe but I guarantee you
35:12 - you have that drive inside of you you
35:14 - have that giant within you you have that
35:16 - wolf that beast inside of you that's
35:18 - kind of just tamed and taught to just
35:22 - relax and chill and put your dreams on
35:25 - pause then it's enough and be grateful
35:28 - and whoa why do you want more those are
35:31 - just two other people and why aren't you
35:32 - happy with this why don't you just get a
35:34 - pension at the end of thirty five years
35:36 - of working at the same place and that's
35:38 - so good compared to like the people in
35:40 - 1920s who didn't even get a job or
35:43 - worked in really terrible conditions in
35:45 - a mining place and so there are
35:48 - different routes you can go right but I
35:50 - would urge you that look you have a lot
35:52 - of potential inside of you right you're
35:54 - watching this right now and you've
35:55 - watched it so far and you if you've
35:57 - understood this so far there's clearly a
35:59 - fire within you my it might just be
36:03 - tamed right now so to burn it basically
36:07 - come to frickin LA right and you know
36:12 - and and come to our let's just like a
36:14 - free tour for everybody let's just run a
36:17 - free tour that would be awesome I'd love
36:19 - to do that if you're actually from LA do
36:20 - type that down below so if we won't ever
36:23 - want to run a free tour we actually will
36:24 - but that was kind of a joke that now is
36:26 - the serious thing I just tried to do
36:29 - half-joking but if you want to build
36:31 - that fire inside of you right and it's
36:34 - not there we'll just look around you
36:35 - it's because the fire in the people
36:38 - around you isn't there so just be around
36:40 - those people that kind of have that far
36:42 - you don't have to be around people who
36:44 - are like in tents and can't live life be
36:47 - around people who are in tents and still
36:49 - enjoy the same things you might right so
36:51 - you can be around somebody who's like
36:53 - jacked but still loves don't starve
36:56 - together the video game you know awesome
36:58 - video game you can be around somebody
37:00 - who's incredibly intelligent but still
37:03 - loves to go jet skiing every weekend you
37:05 - know so all you have to do just find
37:08 - those people just go and do that you
37:13 - know you owe it to yourself and it was
37:15 - incredibly hard decision for him right
37:18 - you could probably see it in his eyes if
37:20 - you zoom in even even if he doesn't say
37:23 - anything it might be a hard decision for
37:28 - you or not right but you owe it to
37:32 - yourself to make that leap make that
37:34 - decision maybe it's not changing where
37:36 - you're living but might be changing your
37:38 - friends around you or if you're a
37:40 - developer it might be changing the
37:42 - people around you maybe you want to be
37:45 - around people who are coding more right
37:47 - that's essentially it okay so that's the
37:50 - action that I would like you to take if
37:53 - you're burning hot be around those
37:56 - people find more people who are burning
37:58 - hotter than you and if you're cold right
37:59 - now
38:00 - again be around people who are burning
38:02 - hot and the same things you want to be
38:03 - burning hot in okay you can still find
38:06 - great friends or also have passion and
38:09 - drive and motivation all that stuff okay
38:12 - okay actually do it
38:16 - alright comment below this video you
38:19 - have any parting words basically to sum
38:22 - it all up all right boo take action in
38:30 - action these two you know you be not not
38:34 - confident okay
38:35 - and ya be around people that you want to
38:39 - be around like people who have the same
38:42 - vision as you not just people who you
38:45 - you know are comfortable with being
38:47 - around that's it that's it bro keep it
