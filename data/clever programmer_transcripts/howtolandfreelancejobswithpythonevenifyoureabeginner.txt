00:07 - Frankie I'm going live right now turn
00:09 - off those lights right there please
00:42 - so look at how easy they made it okay
00:54 - you
01:09 - what's up guys how's it going this is
01:12 - Kazi from clever programmer dot-com
01:15 - welcome to this epic livestream and in
01:19 - this video we're gonna be talking about
01:21 - how to land freelancing jobs with Python
01:26 - even if you're a complete beginner and
01:29 - actually what I'm gonna be doing and I
01:30 - was talking with my friend Frankie are
01:33 - you guys able to hear me now you guys
01:35 - should be able to hear me now if you can
01:36 - hear me please confirm and if you could
01:38 - please man the chat that would be
01:40 - fantastic
01:41 - so what I wanted to share with you and
01:43 - this is like I want to get real with you
01:46 - in this video I want to get raw with you
01:48 - and I want to show you exactly where to
01:51 - go and how to land clients where to find
01:53 - them what type of jobs to look for in
01:56 - this live stream I'm gonna share you the
01:59 - number one secret pitfall that almost
02:02 - every Python up-and-coming developer or
02:05 - anybody who wants to be a freelancer
02:08 - falls into and why they're never
02:11 - make any money and I'll show you
02:12 - specifically what that means and I'll
02:14 - also show you how you can avoid that and
02:16 - actually earn a real income with Python
02:19 - and coding and in this video we're gonna
02:22 - be doing less of talking and I'm gonna
02:25 - be doing more of showing so this means
02:27 - the actual resources that I'm using and
02:30 - the right place to go what type of jobs
02:34 - to look at and where can you actually
02:37 - apply and how much money you can be
02:40 - earning as well I'm also gonna be
02:42 - showing you specifically what type of
02:43 - Python job opportunities exist how much
02:47 - people are paying for them as well as a
02:49 - freelancer because I realized for most
02:52 - of the audience and for most of the
02:54 - people can you use a laptop instead of
02:56 - your phone you don't need an
03:02 - administrator if you can just go live
03:03 - that'd be great just so you can monitor
03:05 - it and see if you can hear it and if
03:08 - people can hear it you know okay
03:13 - alright awesome Thank You G that's my
03:17 - new style you know I got I wanted to go
03:19 - clean No More Homeless anymore alright
03:24 - okay so all right guys let's keep the
03:31 - chat clean guys let's be respectful for
03:34 - everybody that's here we want to make it
03:36 - a high quality live stream for everyone
03:39 - so if you're in the chat and you're
03:42 - acting like an idiot and ruining the
03:44 - experience for everyone who's viewing it
03:47 - we will just kick you out or block you
03:49 - but what I want to do is I want to give
03:51 - you guys massive amounts of value on
03:53 - this live stream all right so it's all
03:55 - for free you're all you're gonna get
03:57 - this value right here right now all
04:00 - right so let's jump right into it with
04:02 - all these things said okay we're gonna
04:04 - get started pretty much right away now
04:08 - what everybody makes it seem like is
04:10 - that getting a freaking job or getting a
04:14 - freelancing opportunity to requires you
04:16 - to have multiple degrees requires you to
04:21 - have years of experience a PhD I
04:24 - don't know what most of these developers
04:26 - say but most of the developers make it
04:28 - seem like rocket science and while there
04:31 - are certain aspects of programming that
04:33 - are actually rocket science specifically
04:35 - if you're working with NASA most things
04:38 - are actually not that hard okay they're
04:41 - a lot easier for you to get started in
04:44 - and especially if you're new you can get
04:46 - started in a lot quicker so I'm gonna
04:51 - show you guys and we're gonna pick
04:52 - things apart live as well okay so here's
04:55 - what we're gonna do I'm gonna open up my
04:57 - document and in this document I'm also
05:01 - gonna show you what type of
05:02 - opportunities never to kind of fall for
05:04 - and go after because they're pretty much
05:06 - just traps and I'm gonna show you what
05:09 - things to go after so let's do this
05:13 - we're gonna do this we're gonna send
05:16 - this one over alright so now you guys
05:18 - should be seeing the live stream and or
05:23 - sorry my screen hopefully and a Frank if
05:26 - you can double check that if people are
05:27 - seeing my screen pretty soon that would
05:29 - be great
05:29 - but I'll keep going alright so I want to
05:32 - give you examples of real-world
05:34 - opportunities on a plateau
05:36 - like up work okay so if you guys don't
05:38 - know what up work is you go to Google
05:39 - Chrome comm you type in upwork.com and
05:43 - this is where you can get freelancing
05:45 - jobs all right so you would go to where
05:48 - it says jobs you would type in Python
05:50 - and you would type it in correctly
05:53 - unlike me and depending on different
05:55 - parts of the world you would either hit
05:57 - this off or you would hit this on okay
06:00 - and let's go down and here you would
06:03 - look for opportunities that you could
06:05 - actually do as a Python developer so
06:08 - check this out okay we have bunch of job
06:11 - opportunities here I'm on this live page
06:13 - hopefully everybody can view this I'll
06:15 - zoom in a little bit more now you're
06:18 - gonna look for opportunities you're
06:19 - gonna cancel out a lot of the things you
06:21 - can't do or maybe you don't have the
06:22 - skill set to do and that's fine maybe
06:24 - you look here DJI SDK Raspberry Pi I
06:28 - don't know how to do this I
06:30 - don't know what DJI is like a drone and
06:32 - working with Raspberry Pi I have no
06:35 - experience working with drones or
06:36 - Raspberry Pi so I'll skip this but now
06:40 - let's go down and I'll probably skip
06:43 - lunar and fertility calculator all right
06:47 - might be interesting to read it but I'm
06:49 - gonna skip that because you know also
06:51 - you have to be expert it's probably
06:53 - require some very specific knowledge
06:54 - maybe it's not a good fit let's keep
06:56 - going full sex off for engineers skip
06:59 - skip skip but now let's take a look at
07:01 - this one okay
07:02 - Python scrapey spider to retrieve PDF
07:06 - links we need three Python scrapy
07:10 - spiders to crawl three different domains
07:14 - and return the names and full URLs of
07:17 - all PDF files on the domain we do not
07:20 - need to download the PDFs only create a
07:23 - list of their names and full URLs must
07:25 - be written in Python alright so what is
07:28 - this person actually asking now it might
07:31 - sound like rocket science but all this
07:36 - person is asking is can you write a
07:40 - Python code that can go to all these web
07:43 - sites and literally pull all the URLs
07:47 - that say dot PDF at the end
07:50 - that's it so if you go to website and
07:54 - you see a URL on there that ends in dot
07:57 - html' don't write that one locally but
08:01 - only write a list of ones that end with
08:03 - dot PDF
08:04 - so all this person is asking is hey
08:06 - write a Python piece of code that can
08:08 - pull all the PDF URLs from the three
08:12 - different websites I give you so for
08:14 - example if I gave you clever programmer
08:16 - com your Python script should be able to
08:18 - go all over clever programmer comm and
08:20 - find all of the PDF links if I gave you
08:25 - Apple comm it should be able to go all
08:28 - through Apple comm and find all the PDF
08:30 - links that's it that's it for this job
08:36 - how much are they paying for this
08:38 - particular job they are paying three
08:40 - hundred dollars so let me zoom in just
08:43 - actually zoom out just a little bit
08:45 - right there you can see it's a three
08:47 - hundred dollar job you could actually
08:49 - apply for it right here right now all
08:52 - right and these people are legit
08:55 - look at where it says $30,000 right so
08:58 - you that's that's generally what you
08:59 - want to look at if you're looking to
09:01 - apply for a job you don't necessarily
09:05 - want to apply to just any job right like
09:09 - here it says your dollar spent payment
09:11 - unverified this person could just be
09:14 - lying or this person probably has no
09:17 - record of hiring people so we don't we
09:19 - don't have enough data but somebody who
09:21 - spent thirty thousand dollars paying
09:25 - other people to work with them they're
09:27 - most likely not playing around so if
09:30 - you're working with them you're gonna be
09:32 - at least making three hundred dollars or
09:33 - more for this particular task now if
09:37 - you're somebody who has cool social
09:41 - skills you could get this particular job
09:43 - and you could hand this job off to
09:47 - somebody who knows how to do it so you
09:49 - could hire a developer from somewhere
09:50 - and make sure that they do this project
09:52 - while you just manage them all right so
09:55 - then you can get profit but you don't
09:59 - even necessarily have to be that good at
10:01 - coding so that's an alternative even if
10:04 - you're not
10:04 - that great of a developer if you're a
10:05 - complete beginner but to be honest to do
10:08 - this project if you even have a little
10:11 - bit of skill in Python like let's say
10:13 - you're past the beginner phase or more
10:15 - intermediate like it says this is a
10:17 - project that you could do very
10:18 - realistically okay so that's one example
10:21 - let's go down and see maybe if there are
10:23 - any other examples that we can see right
10:25 - off the bat so okay let's see this one
10:29 - let me go to the chat first and see
10:32 - what's going on what are people saying
10:33 - in the chat how to use Python are we
10:41 - mark okay great awesome
10:44 - can I see your screen hello
10:47 - okay all right whatever so here I am on
10:53 - this page and you can see it says scrape
10:59 - two sites
11:00 - walk me through so now check this out
11:02 - okay this guy goes I know how to do
11:05 - basic scraping with Python and
11:07 - beautifulsoup I want you to show me how
11:11 - to do a couple of trickier sites or best
11:13 - of all show me how to access an API
11:16 - please note I am not paying you to do it
11:19 - for me so this guy's not even he doesn't
11:22 - even need you to do anything for him he
11:24 - just says I'm paying you to show me how
11:26 - to do it you can give me written
11:29 - instructions but I'd prefer a zoom
11:31 - meeting where we can walk through it
11:33 - together
11:33 - so he's even willing to not even meet
11:36 - with you in person or online or on a
11:38 - one-on-one call he's even okay with the
11:40 - written instructions and he says these
11:43 - are not work-related sites that are
11:45 - gathering information for my fantasy
11:46 - baseball team so he literally wants to
11:49 - hire someone to help him do some web
11:53 - scraping with Python and beautifulsoup
11:54 - for his freakin fantasy baseball team
11:57 - and he's verified here and he's paid
11:59 - people over he's paid a total of over
12:01 - $60 so unlike so it's not a scam it's
12:04 - somebody who's real who's spent real
12:07 - money and all he wants is somebody to
12:10 - walk him through so even if you're
12:12 - pretty much a beginner and you just go
12:14 - through a little bit of training with me
12:16 - on
12:17 - Python and beautifulsoup words or web
12:19 - scraping you can actually work with this
12:21 - person and land this person as your
12:23 - client and they'll be paying you 30 or
12:25 - 50 or $60 an hour so you work with this
12:28 - person for three or four hours that's
12:30 - two hundred three hundred dollars right
12:32 - there for you now before I continue
12:33 - further I do want to know if this is
12:35 - valuable for you is this been helpful so
12:37 - far I'm gonna stop my screen share for
12:40 - just a second all right cool hmm so all
12:58 - right now all this stuff that I'm
13:01 - sharing with you guys right over here we
13:05 - created our new program right around
13:07 - this whole thing because what we want to
13:09 - be able to do for you is I want you to
13:12 - be able to go to these exact jobs learn
13:15 - these exact skills and be able to land
13:18 - clients okay because most of the people
13:21 - they have skills but they have random
13:24 - freaking skills right but how cool would
13:26 - it be if somebody literally okay
13:29 - let me go back to that how cool would it
13:34 - be if somebody literally shows you like
13:36 - if I bring you in and I go we're gonna
13:39 - do this exact project this person is
13:41 - asking for then I'm gonna show you how
13:43 - to go to this exact client on upward
13:45 - exactly what to say to this person and
13:48 - then land this person as your client how
13:51 - cool would it be if somebody just went
13:53 - okay hey man you see this project right
13:59 - over here this Python scrapey spider one
14:02 - yeah I'm gonna show you exactly how to
14:04 - make it so we make it somewhere in a
14:06 - program we make this full project and
14:10 - then I show you exactly how to reach out
14:13 - to this client and how to land this
14:14 - client and then how to solve this
14:16 - problem for them that's essentially what
14:21 - I wanted to do in this new program that
14:22 - we have launched and it's called
14:24 - automate with Python like a badass and
14:27 - that program allows you to
14:30 - land freelancing jobs on platforms like
14:33 - upward comm start earning an income even
14:37 - if you're a complete beginner that is
14:40 - the goal but the new program that we
14:41 - just launched let's go through a few
14:45 - more examples okay so I have a few
14:48 - examples and I want also give you
14:50 - examples of what what not to do all
14:52 - right what type of jobs are bad for
14:54 - example so let's take a look at this job
14:57 - the guy says need help building
15:00 - restaurant app now somebody he needs his
15:06 - entry level that's pretty cool and he
15:08 - goes I'm developing an online
15:10 - application for my family's restaurant
15:12 - I'm an IT graduate certified in computer
15:15 - programming and I will be leading the
15:16 - project I'm interested in working with
15:18 - local developers bla bla bla bla bla bla
15:21 - bla I just kind of skipped over it and
15:23 - then he goes when I plan on meeting I
15:25 - would prefer that the developers are
15:26 - present because sometimes I'll be
15:28 - meeting with investors please send me a
15:30 - message your experience dah dah dah dah
15:33 - dah okay let me ask you a question if
15:38 - you're watching this stream drop it in
15:40 - the chat below right now is this a good
15:43 - job opportunity or is this a bad job
15:46 - opportunity this is a good freelancing
15:48 - opportunity or a bad freelancing
15:50 - opportunity and I want you to critically
15:52 - think and tell me why don't just look at
15:54 - my answer right over here at the
15:56 - top but like give me a reason as how you
15:59 - would reason with it and why I'm gonna
16:01 - jump into the chat now and see what
16:03 - you've come up with so tell me what you
16:05 - think about this
16:12 - our be within this is useful
16:26 - okay some people say no what seems says
16:29 - no Ola says low-rate vishal says no calm
16:35 - mel says good and bad both ELISA $0
16:38 - spent Tanisha says no money spent okay
16:41 - this is really great thank you guys for
16:43 - participating okay I love that thank you
16:46 - so much Abdul Majeed says because your
16:47 - dollar spent this is not good because
16:50 - too many demands and no money spent thus
16:53 - far Eclair okay Siobhan says big no-no
16:56 - money spent
16:58 - Akash says title and step description is
17:01 - not good small steps nope no build this
17:04 - out with PHP gonna be in the
17:06 - pain-in-the-ass Christopher says Robert
17:09 - says $0 spent very vague description bad
17:12 - because too many texts and he seems not
17:14 - reliable no exact income he's fake okay
17:18 - looks like you guys are on the right
17:20 - track so that's fantastic guys by the
17:22 - way thank you for everybody who just
17:24 - spent that much time engaging with it
17:26 - you're much more likely to make way more
17:29 -  money than a lot of the people
17:30 - who are on this livestream but not
17:32 - participating I still love you but these
17:35 - are the things that get you to actually
17:38 - understand a lot of these concepts this
17:40 - is what makes the difference between you
17:42 - getting these clients and not getting
17:43 - these clients and wash these clients be
17:46 - taken by somebody else so thank you for
17:48 - that level of initiative that level of
17:49 - participation because it also makes it a
17:51 - lot more fun for me so thank you for
17:53 - that okay so now I'm gonna go back and
17:56 - I'm gonna give you guys my thoughts on
17:59 - it would you guys like to hear my
18:00 - thoughts on this it's a trick question
18:04 - cuz share it anyway alright let's go so
18:09 - go right here okay
18:13 - so here's why I personally say no so
18:16 - first of all I agree with everyone this
18:18 - guy first of all has no ratings so
18:21 - there's zero stars that he has so that's
18:23 - the first flag for me another flag for
18:27 - me that's pretty huge is that he has
18:29 - spent $0 so far but now here's the big
18:32 - red flag for me he sounds like every
18:35 -  loser who has an idea for an app
18:38 - and
18:39 - they're gonna be meeting with investors
18:41 - and they're trying to sell you some pipe
18:43 - dream of something that doesn't yet
18:44 - exist he doesn't have a prototype
18:47 - he hasn't built anything yet he says I
18:50 - plan to wrap it up and go native I plan
18:53 - to make this I'm thinking about making
18:56 - this maybe I'll be meeting with
18:58 - investors one day
18:59 - there's nothing yet there are no
19:02 - investors yet this person is an IT
19:04 - graduate certified in computer
19:06 - programming okay he doesn't even
19:09 - have a job so it doesn't mean that his
19:14 - idea doesn't have potential it doesn't
19:16 - mean that this might not be the next
19:18 - Facebook it just mean that the odds of
19:20 - all of that are very low and there's no
19:22 - security or any reliability all of us
19:26 - follow the data you have your life is
19:28 - very important guys your time is very
19:31 - important so going down a rabbit hole
19:33 - like this which a lot of freelancers do
19:35 - you will be so surprised so many
19:38 - freelancers will go down this path and
19:40 - there will be so confused and they
19:42 - didn't get any money
19:43 - this guy's not trying to scam you this
19:45 - is a person with good intentions but you
19:47 - are going to not make any money from
19:50 - this or very little money because this
19:53 - person has no money to give you he's a
19:55 - graduate he doesn't even have a job so
19:56 - we're he's gonna give you money from
19:58 - okay and investors and all that stuff is
20:01 - most likely a pipe dream if you get in
20:05 - any Ober car every bird driver you know
20:08 - what I'm talking about every bird driver
20:09 - has like a freaking app idea right you
20:12 - know like all those people everybody has
20:14 - right and all these people have no
20:16 - record for it for their results like why
20:19 - are you working a $7 an hour job
20:22 - but you have this amazing app idea like
20:24 - you should have you should have had
20:26 - something prior to that right like you
20:28 - should have had maybe a business prior
20:29 - to that you should have some kind of
20:31 - track record right then maybe your idea
20:33 - is more believable people want to get
20:34 - behind it so stay away from this is a
20:38 - trap this type of stuff okay again I'm
20:41 - not saying oh it's a scam or anything
20:42 - but I'm just saying that even though
20:45 - this person has good intentions
20:46 - you want to be really intelligent as a
20:48 - freelancer as a developer so then you
20:50 - that you could get paid what you're
20:52 - worth
20:53 - not be undermined and overworked okay so
20:58 - that is what I would say to that let me
21:00 - go and see what people are saying in the
21:02 - live chat because I want to make sure I
21:03 - engage with with you guys all right of
21:08 - course not
21:09 - zero income bla bla bla bla bla why not
21:15 - okay
21:18 - okay let's see
21:27 - okay what are people saying
21:32 - so no lurking yep yep all right so some
21:39 - people asked in the in some people email
21:42 - me from this livestream and they asked
21:43 - hey is this class so when you join this
21:48 - class guys you have access to when you
21:50 - join automate with Python the new
21:52 - program that we just launched you
21:53 - actually have access to it for a
21:55 - lifetime alright this is not you don't
21:57 - have access to for a little bit so even
21:59 - though it's a module program and we're
22:02 - only gonna add more modules to help you
22:04 - start earning an income because the

23:05 - immediately so if it were you and let's
23:10 - say you are either a complete beginner
23:12 - or you have just a little bit of skill

23:23 - critical thinking and your reason behind

24:09 - alright so if those are the questions
24:12 - you want to ask that are very technical
24:13 - everything is covered in the course I
24:15 - would suggest you at least check it out
24:18 - okay alright let's see what's going on
24:21 - thanks for the info Robert says David
24:23 - Roberts and Snagit now ok Python and
24:27 - JavaScript worth more okay so somebody
24:32 - says Christopher says why not cool Mikey
24:37 - says yes seems good for a beginner Dino
24:40 - says you will do something like that for
24:41 - free cuz I can't pay that much
24:43 - no Camila is still suspicious comments
24:47 - all the suspicious gig look suspicious
24:49 - UNK it says knows your star and not
24:51 - challenging Carlos says yes he will do
24:55 - it because it says $600 spent and
24:57 - requires English okay say it says
25:00 - definitely yes came an 12:30 says yes
25:04 - payment history is there Loco
25:07 - lightning says maybe only thing does not
25:08 - have much info Shawn says to be honest I
25:12 - won't because he's not specific about
25:13 - the problem Robert says any good
25:15 - reference is a worthwhile investment
25:17 - okay
25:18 - all right I do it if it's an up front or
25:21 - at least secured by third party Bruna
25:23 - says they have no rating that spent 600
25:27 - I'd go for it
25:27 - okay cool
25:30 - Claire says I would apply alright so
25:32 - let's see here's how I would answer it
25:37 - there's no clear right or wrong answer
25:39 - sometimes there is but I'll just give
25:42 - you my thoughts behind it so you guys
25:45 - can see how I would kind of tackle
25:46 - thinking about this okay
25:48 - all right whoops
25:54 - okay so here's how I would kind of think
25:57 - about this Python beginner homework help
25:59 - needed now if I was in the or position
26:02 - where I was looking for a client and to
26:05 - work with someone and I want to just be
26:07 - able to live my own lifestyle right like
26:08 - I'm living in Hollywood I want to work
26:11 - remotely I want to be able to kind of
26:14 - have my own lifestyle choose my own
26:15 - hours have my own clients kind of earn
26:17 - an income and then choose my ability to
26:19 - hire and fire clients and I saw this now
26:22 - be like hmm
26:23 - skill level can't be that hard it's high
26:25 - school homework I have good English
26:28 - they're looking to hire immediately they
26:31 - are payment verified they have already
26:34 - spent over six hundred dollars for me
26:40 - depends on your interest right if this
26:43 - is genuinely not interesting to you then
26:45 - maybe don't do it I love working with
26:48 - people I love teaching I love explaining
26:52 - things it deepens my knowledge it also I
26:56 - love seeing the transformation that
26:58 - takes place in people and you change the
27:00 - trajectory of their entire life so for
27:04 - me that's what's really powerful and
27:05 - magnetic about this being able to have
27:08 - that opportunity and then privileged and
27:10 - outside of that I'm getting paid for
27:13 - this as well
27:14 - so it's a win on many different
27:17 - spectrums and now if I have another
27:20 - client who I like less I can fire that
27:23 - client or I can choose to up my rates
27:26 - with that client it gives me more
27:27 - options so you want to have your power
27:30 - comes from the number of options you
27:31 - have okay so this is you know if if
27:36 - you're talking about the dating world
27:38 - and if you guys have options of which
27:42 - girl you could hang out with or make her
27:45 - your girlfriend or your wife right you
27:48 - get to choose who you want to be with
27:50 - but if you don't have that option you
27:53 - will go with literally whoever is there
27:55 - available for you sometimes people get
27:58 - into a relationship and stay in that
28:00 -  relationship for a long time out
28:02 - of convenience and out of having no
28:04 - options all right so you
28:07 - to always be the person who's in the
28:09 - position where you're choosing from a
28:11 - position of power rather than that of
28:14 - weakness then when you commit to a
28:16 - relationship then you really commit or
28:18 - if you commit to a client then you
28:20 - really commit so in this case I would
28:23 - say this would be a yes okay this is a
28:26 - great opportunity all right let's see
28:31 - what people have said before I continue
28:33 - any further let's go right there throw
28:37 - my face back on go here bada BAM bada
28:41 - boom let's see what people are saying
28:43 - all right
28:45 - paying well okay cool
28:48 - David is down for it say is genuine
28:51 - client Geetha's yes it is good for
28:55 - Python beginners Claire says yes I would
28:57 - also enjoy teaching explaining concept
28:59 - which eventually resonates with the
29:01 - student awesome Carlos says power
29:03 - choices comes from a mind set up of
29:05 - abundance exactly okay cool
29:10 - so all right cool okay hopefully I think
29:17 - hopefully for you guys this has been
29:19 - valuable so far this was something new
29:22 - that I wanted to do I'd never done this
29:24 - before I wanted to give it a try and see
29:26 - how you guys like it to be honest this
29:30 - is super if I was in that position this
29:32 - would have been massively valuable for
29:34 - me that's why I shared it because if I
29:37 - was back in the day where I was looking
29:39 - for clients and wanted to know how I
29:40 - could do it I would love to be able to
29:42 - just see exactly what I need to do okay
29:45 - so again if you guys are here and
29:47 - interested in all this stuff so far I'm
29:48 - gonna talk about how to automate with
29:50 - Python like a badass our brand new
29:53 - program that we just launched me and my
29:55 - entire team we worked on it and in that
29:58 - program we literally take these types of
30:01 - jobs from up work we complete them as
30:04 - projects that you can have on your
30:05 - portfolio and then we show you how you
30:07 - can go to these clients on up work how
30:10 - do you build a profile how do you go and
30:12 - reach out to these clients and how do
30:14 - you land these types of clients for
30:16 - these exact jobs so we don't want to
30:19 - just teach you
30:20 - random automation stuff that you
30:21 - can find on udemy.com
30:23 - or you can find on you know YouTube
30:26 - anywhere we want to give you the real
30:29 - stuff that you can actually apply in

30:33 - go to these practical jobs and get them
30:35 - done so we wanted to keep it as real
30:37 - world as practical as possible for you

30:47 - important to be just transparent and
