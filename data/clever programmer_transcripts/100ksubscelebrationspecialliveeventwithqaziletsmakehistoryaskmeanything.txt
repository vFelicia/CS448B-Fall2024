03:18 - give me a second I'm gonna set up window
03:21 - capture here and we'll get that sub
03:24 - count rolling for you guys so you can
03:26 - see exactly where we are
03:27 - give me a second sub channel and chrome
03:38 - this one right yep then is there a way I
03:46 - can crop it

03:58 - no I don't think that does it Oh what is
04:02 - going on sorry guys this is a little bit
04:07 - more confusing than I had expected well

04:17 - want that screen capture display capture
04:36 - manual all right I'm gonna put this
04:47 - right here
04:48 - let's see hopefully this should work for
04:53 - you guys all right we got the sub count
04:59 - there you should be able to see that sub
05:01 - count so that should be good and how's
05:05 - it going with you guys
05:06 - from everywhere everybody who is here or
05:10 - everybody is on the live stream keep
05:12 - checking on the cameras because they're
05:14 - kind of getting funky angles on some of
05:16 - them everybody's on the live stream
05:19 - Instagram you know
05:20 - hi everybody on Instagram we are doing a
05:23 - 100,000 subscribers special and it's 3
05:28 - a.m. in Chicago so it's really late but
05:32 - me and my entire team is up and my
05:35 - friends are here and we're trying to
05:37 - make sure that we hit 100k together okay
05:41 - so that's kind of what we're trying to
05:43 - do even though I know it's really late
05:45 - where everybody is so yeah the so the
05:49 - subscriber count is up going going up
05:51 - really fast right now
05:53 - some people are also unsubscribing which
05:56 - is okay but if you guys are watching
06:00 - this and you guess for subscribing we're
06:03 - gonna be hitting 100,000 subscribers on
06:06 - YouTube a lot faster and that would be
06:10 - great okay maybe let me move this thing
06:13 - on on the right hand side so I don't get
06:18 - in its way
06:22 - ah you guys are gonna get to see the sub
06:23 - count go up
06:29 - this is so crazy you guys this all
06:33 - started with just me having this dream
06:37 - of building this channel and in the
06:40 - email that I sent out to a lot of
06:42 - students that clever programmer again it
06:45 - was just me literally I would wake up
06:49 - and go to school and I would come back
06:52 - from school and then I would just start
06:55 - working on making these videos these
06:58 - computer programming videos I didn't
07:02 - know if anybody was gonna watch it I
07:04 - just kind of crossed my fingers and
07:06 - hoped that people would watch it online
07:08 - and that it would bring you guys value
07:11 - ok everybody was watching right now
07:13 - except none of you guys were there
07:15 - before there were exactly zero followers
07:18 - nobody knew what was going on hell I
07:22 - didn't even know what what was going on
07:24 - I didn't even know what I was doing and
07:27 - then to go from there with zero
07:31 - followers nobody believing in you your
07:33 - family thinking oh it's cute what you're
07:35 - trying to do your friends going yeah you
07:37 - can do whatever you want just be
07:39 - yourself and just kind of giving you
07:42 - some generic advice some of the friends
07:44 - believe in you you know like my friend
07:46 - who's here Tenzin he really believed in
07:48 - me and that's always been something
07:51 - that's so special to me you know you
07:52 - always got to have some of those friends
07:54 - that are gonna believe in you regardless
07:59 - of anything else and they're not just
08:01 - bullshitting you like to actually
08:03 - actually actually believe in you and
08:05 - that's a rare rare rare quality so I was
08:10 - lucky to have friends like that I was
08:12 - lucky to be surrounded by people like
08:14 - that if you don't have that around you
08:17 - you know make sure that you're
08:21 - surrounded by real friends because I'm
08:22 - telling you the people who don't believe

13:14 - that's what it's gonna be
13:19 - eirick rosen one of my good friends from
13:21 - high school when we were going when I
13:24 - was playing chess and learning chess for
13:28 - those of you guys who don't know I'm top
13:29 - 1% in the world for chess that's kind of
13:32 - how it started it was in my high school
13:34 - career and Eric Rosen says I remember
13:38 - when cause II was a socially awkward kid
13:41 - at chess club now he's the bomb with
13:46 - four exclamation marks that's hilarious
13:50 - that's awesome actually yeah as crazy
13:54 - and Eric Rosen is even better than I am
13:57 - at chess he kicks my ass all the time
13:59 - and to this day I have been unable to
14:02 - beat him I play him a lot and I just
14:05 - kind of get smashed every single time
14:09 - I was born in Chicago James branch says
14:12 - 1946 a long time ago that's great
14:15 - everybody's welcome
14:16 - whether you're 2 years old or whether
14:18 - you're 90 years old doesn't matter to me
14:20 - man or girl as long as you're here like
14:26 - this is so cool that this is gonna be
14:29 - happening today and this is the day and
14:35 - that we get to be here and make history
14:38 - together
14:41 - Mario blanco says what up Kazi 10:15 in
14:46 - the Netherlands just finish your course
14:48 - yesterday yesterday Rock Paper Scissors
14:52 - what now we're gonna be making another
14:55 - Rock Paper Scissors right we have
14:58 - another Rock Paper Scissors another
15:00 - awesome projects lined up for you guys
15:03 - there's a lot of special stuff coming up
15:06 - especially with my new course coming out
15:09 - in a few days so we are gonna be worried
15:14 - we have a lot of things put together
15:16 - okay I don't want to reveal anything now
15:18 - that's for another time because right
15:21 - now we're kind of just here to celebrate
15:23 - we're here to you know I want to give
15:27 - you guys value so whatever your guys's
15:29 - questions are any kind of burning pain
15:33 - that you have or anything kind of I can
15:35 - help with so I'm gonna take a question
15:36 - on Facebook right now then I'll take a
15:38 - question on Instagram and then I'll jump
15:42 - over on YouTube okay Facebook how to
15:47 - make perfect command on C programming
15:49 - because where I'm studying it's hard to
15:51 - learn coding because of lots of
15:53 - assignment work mid semesters quiz and
15:56 - lots of [ __ ] dot-dot-dot what
16:06 - yeah like what is that what does that
16:08 - mean do you know do you understand the
16:11 - question okay so the question is like
16:14 - how to make perfect command on C
16:17 - programming because we're I'm studying
16:20 - it's hard to learn coding with the
16:22 - capital C because of lots of assignment
16:27 - work capital L and capital a lots of
16:30 - assignment work mid semesters quiz and
16:34 - lots of [ __ ] yeah so my friend says I
16:44 - think you need some time management
16:45 - skills my friend and I honestly think
16:47 - you do yeah of course everybody has
16:52 - business be stuff going on and there's
16:55 - nobody that's free and there's never a
16:57 - single time you're free but you still
16:59 - got to get stuff done
17:00 - Elon Musk has like eight big companies
17:02 - so he gets his stuff done learn about
17:05 - like time management and not just time
17:09 - management but more importantly what are
17:13 - the things that you prioritize because
17:15 - we're not very good at time management
17:16 - like that's not something I'm good at
17:19 - right people think that somehow we're
17:21 - very good at time management or people
17:24 - who are creating content or running a
17:25 - business no it's just we are very insane
17:29 - and we just prioritize for example
17:33 - YouTube creating content and business as
17:36 - a crazy big priority for me so I'm
17:39 - extreme in that but then maybe like
17:41 - there are other aspects of life where
17:43 - I'm lacking or I'm not spending as much
17:45 - time as I should be you know like I'm
17:49 - trying to have more fun enjoy myself
17:50 - more but it's sometimes a little bit
17:53 - difficult you know so for example
17:55 - instead of having this very balanced
17:57 - life for me what works is having these
18:00 - obsessive cycles and then of different
18:04 - things so for example if I want to learn
18:05 - jujitsu and I want to practice it some
18:07 - kind of fighting form you know jujitsu
18:09 - that's what I'm doing all the time or if
18:12 - I want to do skydiving or if I want to
18:16 - learn how to play a game like pool
18:17 - that's what my life is about
18:20 - for a YouTube right now life is all
18:23 - YouTube okay lisa says 54 question mark
18:35 - Kazi I am 54 in other videos you said to
18:39 - get on YouTube I don't want to or make
18:41 - any udemy videos can you still make a
18:44 - living coding and am I too old okay Lisa
18:48 - this is a very good question that you
18:51 - have you said I'm 54
18:53 - I'm worried first of all am I too old
18:56 - that's one of our concerns and then also
19:00 - you mentioned that you don't want to get
19:02 - in front of a camera and you don't want
19:04 - to create content or whatever okay great
19:07 - not everybody wants to create content
19:09 - not everybody wants to do videos I
19:11 - totally get it 99% of the developers
19:14 - actually even more and none of them do
19:16 - any of that okay and you don't have to
19:19 - it's possible for you to get jobs it's
19:22 - possible for you to get work without any
19:24 - of those things keep in mind guys that I
19:28 - got my first job in three months of
19:31 - learning to code okay wasn't some
19:33 - amazing thing that happened there are a
19:34 - few things and I always talk about them
19:37 - you know in my emails I talked about it
19:41 - last livestream if you missed it go
19:44 - watch it and I'm gonna be talking about
19:45 - it over the next coming weeks I have
19:48 - some amazing things put together for you
19:50 - guys like this master class where I
19:52 - cover a lot but to answer Lisa's
19:56 - question you're not too old because
20:00 - you're gonna be 55 regardless of what
20:04 - happens in your life right you're 54
20:06 - right now you're gonna be 55 somebody
20:07 - who's 55 is gonna be 56 regardless of
20:11 - what happens the question is do you want
20:13 - to be 55 exactly how you are right now
20:16 - or do you want to be 55 with a new skill
20:20 - added on okay so that's kind of really
20:23 - what it is and for you to get some kind
20:26 - of result in three to six months or
20:28 - maybe even a year let's say it takes you
20:30 - a year that's not that long of a
20:33 - okay it's still happening within that
20:35 - time for if you're whether if you're too
20:38 - old I have also made a special video on
20:40 - this which is called am I too old to
20:44 - start coding and how that video kind of
20:48 - came about was this one person one of my
20:51 - students she said her name was Catherine
20:55 - and she said that she was I think
20:57 - forty-five years old she had three kids
21:00 - had a full-time job had a husband and
21:05 - she finds it very difficult that out of
21:09 - that all of that stuff she gets any like
21:12 - getting any time to code but she was
21:14 - still finding two to three hours to code
21:16 - every single day and then improving one
21:21 - route to go is spend a lot of time and
21:23 - just work with hours and that's usually
21:27 - what I say is like the theoretical route
21:28 - where you can just spend a lot of time
21:30 - coding and building those skills but
21:33 - here's another alternative route that
21:36 - I'm a big fan of that I think is highly
21:39 - effective and this is something that
21:41 - came on came out in Carnegie Mellon
21:44 - Carnegie Mellon right that's the name of
21:47 - the University their study and they said
21:50 - 85% of your financial success comes from
21:55 - your likability your personal skills
22:00 - your communication all right and so
22:05 - basically in other words to sum it up
22:06 - 85% of your success comes with your soft
22:09 - skills 15% of your success comes with
22:13 - technical skills so here's the awesome
22:17 - part as a 54 year old you have all this
22:21 - experience that you've gained in your
22:23 - life that will be helping you unlike
22:26 - somebody who was 20 when they were
22:27 - starting okay so maybe being younger it
22:30 - can even be a disadvantage at certain
22:32 - times okay it can be advantage in other
22:34 - ways where we have maybe more time to
22:36 - invest maybe more energy maybe more
22:38 - passion and motivation but what you have
22:42 - is a lot of references throughout your
22:44 - life you can use those
22:46 - okay to get a jump start and you only
22:51 - have to know actually a little bit of
22:52 - coding what I would have you spend your
22:54 - time on is learn how to do practical
22:58 - things that solve people's problems
23:00 - don't just be doing those coding
23:03 - exercises that are super complicated and
23:05 - require all this crazy math again when I
23:09 - started I was a college student going to
23:12 - Oakton Community College had about a 2
23:16 - to 2.5 GPA and got a really really low
23:22 - score on my high school tests and then I
23:27 - went from that to making over a hundred
23:30 - and four thousand dollars as a sophomore
23:34 - at Oakton Community College not because
23:37 - I was smart
23:38 - not because I was gifted but because I
23:41 - found mentors as I went along and kind
23:46 - of worked on practical things rather
23:49 - than these esoteric whatever okay I just
23:53 - avoided listening to people who were
23:55 - talking about I need to be too good at
23:56 - math or I need to be a certain age
23:59 - figure out your limiting beliefs
24:01 - literally write them down everything
24:04 - that tells you you can't do it take out
24:06 - a piece of paper write down everything
24:08 - that makes you say that you can't do it
24:11 - or you're not good enough okay and then
24:13 - go deep into why you think that alright
24:17 - and then I want you to make a list of
24:20 - things that are good and that can help
24:24 - you achieve this goal okay and then
24:25 - start making progress towards it that's
24:28 - how it answer that and let's move on to
24:32 - more questions collab age Ajax one of my
24:38 - oldest followers yeah he's awesome
24:43 - his real name is show beat show or show
24:47 - Beth but he says collaborate ends and
24:49 - you know like code fights alright miss
24:53 - love says what up what up miss love I
24:56 - know miss love also from a long time
24:59 - on list comprehensions what is
25:01 - recommended for 14 year old okay I'm
25:03 - gonna start going through a little bit
25:04 - faster I'm gonna start getting some
25:06 - energy going into this and let's keep
25:09 - going mmm all right so what's the deal
25:20 - with the 14 year old 14 year old what
25:23 - there's no other deal Sam deal oh just
25:26 - like everybody else put in the work and
25:28 - you'll get results big thing to avoid is
25:34 - that when you're young you think you
25:37 - have the luxury to waste a lot of your
25:39 - time when you have time you think you
25:41 - have the luxury to waste a lot of your
25:44 - time
25:44 - okay this like it's this facade it's as
25:47 - fake mentality that like you cover
25:50 - yourself in and the world tells you and
25:52 - they just go you have a lot of time you
25:54 - have a lot of time I don't want you to
25:56 - be thinking that you don't have a lot of
25:57 - time and be working from this place of
26:00 - paranoia and panicking but I want you to
26:03 - know that don't just listen to people
26:07 - who are saying you just have all the
26:09 - time in the world and you can be just
26:10 - taking all the wrong steps if you think
26:12 - coding is for you start taking actions
26:14 - start building practical stuff you can
26:16 - be making money as a 14 year old okay
26:19 - you can start supporting yourself maybe
26:21 - you can start supporting your family
26:24 - maybe you can start supporting your
26:26 - friends I don't know whatever it is for
26:28 - you you can start becoming an adult even
26:31 - if you're 14 years old and be making
26:34 - business deals you can become a
26:36 - businessman you can start your own
26:37 - business at the young age you can start
26:39 - a software as a service company and you
26:42 - can be doing this again very young like
26:44 - I had one of the people that clever
26:45 - programmer this dude was making over
26:47 - sixty or seventy thousand dollars a
26:49 - month he was I think 14 or 15 years old
26:53 - and he had built something like stripe
26:56 - but in Russia and yeah he was killing it
27:01 - and he was also doing some e-commerce
27:03 - business and he's a clever programmer
27:05 - student learning coding so that he could
27:08 - now turn it into some us stuff okay
27:11 - so just be resource
27:13 - and don't let your age be an excuse
27:17 - that's what I would tell myself if I was
27:20 - you know if I could just go back in time
27:21 - because I was just like oh I have all
27:23 - the time in the world and again that's
27:25 - kind of a false statement Tech with me

58:41 - October October of last year zero subs
58:59 - like let's just enjoy this moment of
59:01 - silence you know let's just have a
59:04 - moment of silence for this epic epic how
59:32 - many followers did I start with zero
59:36 - it's true much is it love that had a
59:41 - thing throw it all for now yeah here's a
59:46 - like so messed up we don't care
59:50 - zero followers taking out loans to get
59:54 - an iMac okay I took out loans to get
59:57 - iMac as a student I'd have any money why
60:00 - this $3500 for an iMac yeah this same
60:04 - iMac that I'm using right now I got this
60:08 - um what else do they get lights these
60:11 - same lights actually that you guys are
60:13 - seeing right now that make this look
60:14 - good right now
60:15 - lights backdrop I recently got an office
60:21 - I didn't have an office back then but
60:22 - that's I got a camera yeah got camera
60:30 - tripod all of that was just with loans
60:34 - okay and yeah you don't know whether
60:39 - it's gonna go well whether it's gonna go
60:41 - terribly you don't know like the biggest
60:47 - difference between somebody who is just
60:49 - doing a job
60:50 - and trying to run a company or create a
60:54 - channel like YouTube or whatever you
60:58 - guys know what it is
61:02 - put your guesses put your guesses in the
61:07 - comments Instagram is going bye-bye in a
61:12 - second why I will be getting my silver
61:14 - play button soon but the biggest
61:16 - difference I'm gonna give you guys
61:18 - answer right now the biggest difference
61:20 - is your tolerance to ambiguity okay your
61:27 - tolerance to ambiguity and how much can
61:31 - you handle not knowing that's what
61:34 - defines an entrepreneur versus somebody
61:38 - who's just doing a job okay and you can
61:41 - be entrepreneur even doing a job for
61:44 - example if you're a Python developer you
61:46 - can be an entrepreneur and you can be
61:48 - getting different clients and who you're
61:50 - working with you can land jobs not just
61:53 - by sitting and sending resumes maybe you
61:55 - can start networking with people around
61:56 - you there are a lot of ways to be an
61:59 - entrepreneur but again it's a lot about
62:01 - handling that uncertainty and how do you
62:04 - deal with it you have this feeling in
62:07 - your stomach like you're gonna puke not
62:10 - knowing or can you be like this is okay
62:14 - I'm gonna find out what the road is
62:16 - ahead I'm gonna plan something out I'm
62:19 - gonna have a vision and I'm gonna trust
62:20 - my instincts okay so it's a lot of that
62:26 - you know I failed multiple businesses I
62:28 - used to have a channel called chest a
62:29 - steak that has like hundred fifty subs
62:31 - it's dead now go look at it
62:33 - bye
62:37 - I started other things other YouTube
62:40 - videos right remember we would make so
62:42 - many youtube videos we were trying to do
62:44 - this Hostgator affiliate marketing stuff
62:46 - so many we would literally spend hours
62:48 - upon hours we spent weeks recording
62:51 - these videos scripting it out trying to
62:53 - make this business how many businesses
62:55 - have we gone through we started Amazon
62:56 - FBA business we started quantum
63:02 - Burroughs
63:04 - we started developer products which was
63:07 - about like launching products we reached
63:10 - out to like so many manufacturers in
63:12 - China and built all these relationships
63:14 - only to not lead anywhere and failed but
63:18 - those failures other people see and they
63:21 - go they take a sip of their they take a
63:25 - sip of their they go
63:27 - told you so yeah right to take a sip of
63:30 - their little told you so
63:32 - whereas for us it's a learning
63:35 - experience and kind of battle scars so
63:39 - to speak without those you don't like we
63:43 - won't be here this channel wouldn't be
63:44 - here those references yeah you have to
63:47 - get those references without them you
63:48 - don't really know where you're going and
63:50 - I mean great like they didn't build the
63:55 - platform like just a stick and failed
63:57 - but that's the difference between let's
63:59 - say me and somebody else or maybe you
64:03 - know maybe you and somebody else right
64:05 - maybe you both were let's say 30 at some
64:08 - point and then you became 31 they went
64:11 - from being 32 31 without failing and you
64:13 - went from 30 31 while failing a few
64:16 - things okay and there's a lot of honor
64:18 - and failure failure is the only way to
64:22 - proceed forward when you go to the gym
64:24 - and if you're picking up five pound
64:25 - dumbbells and curling with them you're
64:29 - never gonna be failing so that's great
64:32 - but are you gonna be making any progress
64:35 - there's gonna be zero progress that
64:38 - you're gonna be making okay
64:41 - so failure is actually your indicator
64:44 - that you're going in the right direction
64:47 - I'm gonna say it again failure is your
64:50 - indicator that you're going in the right
64:52 - direction okay
64:54 - failure is your GPS and life failure and
64:58 - feeder is your GPS and life not Google
65:01 - Maps not ways not Apple Maps not
65:05 - whatever other maps that exists
65:06 - definitely not Apple Maps even though I
65:09 - love Apple they just didn't do a very
65:11 - good job with that freaking out Google
65:14 - Maps is really good but even though I
65:17 - have everything
65:17 - Appl okay iPhone Apple headphones Apple
65:20 - anyways sidetracked failure and fear is
65:26 - your navigation in life all right as
65:30 - long as you can stand making yourself
65:32 - uncomfortable you're growing when you're
65:35 - very comfortable where you are you are
65:37 - not growing not growing is not wrong but
65:42 - not growing is not making progress if
65:45 - you're okay with that good for you
65:47 - I'm not okay with that my friend is not
65:50 - okay with that my other friend is not
65:52 - okay with that we're okay with going
65:55 - with sleepless nights eye bags and all
66:00 - kinds of crazy stuff question is are you
66:03 - if you do want all those results and
66:07 - things that you say you want and the
66:09 - lifestyle that you say you want and the
66:12 - job that you say you want and the impact
66:15 - that you want to make on this world that
66:17 - you say you want why aren't you willing
66:22 - to put in the work that gets you those
66:24 - things do you know it's as easy being
66:27 - exactly where you are as it is going
66:30 - towards your goals in the directions you
66:32 - want to go to exactly yes for those of
66:45 - you guys who may not have heard him say
66:46 - something very important on YouTube it
66:49 - takes the same amount of work as being
66:51 - lazy as it takes to be successful okay a
66:56 - lazy person has to go through making
66:58 - these excruciatingly excuses every
67:02 - single goddamn day they go I couldn't do
67:06 - this because I'm busy I couldn't do this
67:09 - because I had all these other tasks and
67:11 - obligations I couldn't go to the gym and
67:14 - make myself look and feel better
67:15 - because I don't know I had to pick up my
67:18 - kids I couldn't put in this extra work I
67:22 - couldn't update my portfolio
67:25 - I couldn't upgrade my LinkedIn I
67:27 - couldn't I couldn't I couldn't I
67:28 - couldn't I couldn't and is just as giant
67:32 - of excuses and - are sitting there
67:35 - looking you dead and I telling you this
67:36 - you know they're bullshitting you and
67:40 - actually them to know that they're lying
67:42 - you both know but you make this non
67:46 - verbal agreement with your eyes that
67:49 - you're just gonna both agree to look the
67:53 - other way make each other feel
67:55 - comfortable where you are you're not fat
67:58 - you're just what's the word what did
68:01 - they say I've forgot it's like you're
68:07 - not fat you're just cuddly I don't know
68:08 - something like that whatever it's like I
68:12 - don't know it's something like that it's
68:14 - like yeah they'll know somebody will say
68:17 - from the livestream but it's like people
68:19 - will say things like that okay and it's
68:22 - not true if you're fat in your shape
68:24 - that's something you need to work on if
68:25 - you're not financially secure if you're
68:28 - not doing the job you need to be doing
68:29 - or you want to be doing or the things
68:31 - you need to be doing that's something
68:33 - that has to change and you need friends
68:35 - and other people around you kind of
68:38 - calling you out on that I think it's
68:41 - like people say you're not fat you
68:45 - should be proud of your own body right
68:47 - right and then when you're a parent and
68:51 - you're fluffy exactly see I'm not fat
68:54 - I'm fluffy I'm right I was like super
68:55 - close to what it was to know this oh my
69:03 - boy Zack Covey is on here awesome he's
69:06 - actually gonna be in Chicago yeah he's
69:10 - dead near Chicago actually in Schaumburg
69:11 - or something I saw some snapchats from
69:13 - Zac cuvee why did it stop his message
69:20 - it's like we're almost getting these fat
69:22 - jokes
69:24 - regardless technicality of that specific
69:30 - phrase aside you guys get the point and
69:32 - the point is that you have all these
69:34 - people getting this fake cushion this
69:37 - fake whatever
69:38 - yet you go to all the hospices where
69:42 - people are dying and you go to all these
69:45 - places it like
69:46 - hospitals and they interview people who
69:48 - are about to die and their write down
69:50 - what were the last things on their mind
69:52 - and what's the last thing they're
69:54 - leaving this planet with and you know
69:57 - what's a number one thing people say
70:02 - they say it's regret okay what kind of
70:10 - regret regret of doing too much or
70:16 - regret of not doing too much and you
70:20 - know what the regret most of the times
70:22 - is it's of not doing too much of wishing
70:26 - that they tried to do the things and
70:28 - expand themselves to places where they
70:31 - thought that couldn't and things in then
70:34 - never really took a chance and tried
70:36 - them never gave themselves the
70:38 - confidence believed in something then
70:40 - themselves enough to do those things
70:42 - okay and not taking those chances so
70:46 - it's a morbid topic but I do want you to
70:50 - sometimes think of that because for some
70:53 - of us it can jolt us I know it jolts me
70:56 - and gets me moving but that's that
70:59 - initial spark that initial motivation
71:01 - then later you have to find your why for
71:03 - why you're doing something and that's
71:04 - gonna keep you going it's kind of when
71:08 - you open a door you need that initial
71:09 - energy but to keep the door open you
71:11 - need a doorknob in place so right now
71:13 - maybe you're in a place where you're
71:15 - procrastinating and you're not you're
71:17 - just scurrying along and you're just
71:18 - doing your 9:00 to 5:00 and you're just
71:20 - stuck in this in this limbo and you need
71:24 - that initial push so this something that
71:27 - I might say that might be coming off a
71:28 - little harsh but it might be that push
71:31 - that you need then later what you need
71:33 - to do is develop a system for why you're
71:35 - doing this okay maybe you're doing this
71:36 - for your family I know I am doing this
71:38 - and a lot of things for getting my
71:40 - parents a retirement I'm doing this to
71:43 - give my family support because when I
71:47 - got to United States we got in a crazy
71:50 - car accident where everybody in the
71:52 - family came out okay except for my mom
71:54 - she had two disks or two back disks
71:58 - broken and we couldn't afford her
72:01 - surgery so guess what we waited 12 years
72:04 - and in those 12 years you know what
72:06 - happened because her back disc was
72:09 - broken she couldn't really move a lot
72:10 - she ended up developing diabetes
72:12 - diabetes she ended up gaining a lot of
72:15 - weight that came with a whole set of
72:17 - another all these other types of
72:19 - problems and seeing that breaks broke my
72:25 - heart kind of broke me as I was growing
72:27 - up because it made me have this really
72:29 - deep feeling of helplessness and for any
72:34 - of you guys listening I want you guys to
72:38 - understand that it's possible to get out
72:41 - of that okay like for me when I was
72:44 - feeling that deep feeling of
72:45 - helplessness I'm like how could I get
72:46 - out of this what's my why what's my why
72:49 - that could keep me going and doing the
72:51 - things that I'm doing
72:52 - for example staying up until 5:00 a.m.
72:54 - getting two hours of sleep and then just
72:56 - going the next day I'm thinking about
72:58 - those things I don't want that to happen
73:02 - to anybody who's close to me where I
73:04 - literally can't if like if not help them
73:07 - financially something like surgery if we
73:10 - could have gotten if we had the money we
73:11 - could have gone this a lot earlier like
73:13 - one night in the hospital was something
73:15 - like $30,000 and we just couldn't afford
73:17 - it and that really really really really
73:21 - really really blows that just sucks
73:24 - somebody who's so close to you somebody
73:26 - who you love so much
73:27 - and you just watch them agonize over
73:29 - this long course of 12 years so again
73:37 - for me that's what keeps me going that's
73:39 - what keeps me motivated I don't want
73:41 - this to happen to anybody again and
73:42 - that's why I'm like I want to be making
73:45 - a lot of money so I don't have just
73:47 - enough for myself for but for other
73:49 - people around me and maybe that could be
73:51 - your Y or something like this could be
73:53 - your Y as well you know you need that
73:55 - initial push to get going and then you
73:57 - have that Y that's like that door knob
73:59 - that keeps that door open okay that
74:02 - keeps your motivation in place that's
74:03 - the system that keeps you going so kind
74:08 - of think about those things
74:11 - enjoy that and move on from that
74:16 - and understand that when you look at
74:20 - life from that perspective where
74:21 - everything is so macroscopic and that's
74:24 - such a massive scale you'll start to see
74:27 - your little problems as these very
74:28 - little things if you look at this
74:31 - universe and how it's like there's multi
74:33 - universes going on that little drama
74:36 - that you might have going on with
74:37 - somebody like at work or a family member
74:39 - or friend that's nothing that doesn't
74:43 - even exist like the universe doesn't
74:45 - care about that so for you if you can
74:48 - start to see all these things at this
74:50 - high of a level you can start ignoring
74:52 - all the little things that are nagging
74:53 - at you and you can start focusing and
74:56 - going to the things that actually really
74:58 - matter all right
75:01 - [Music]

75:12 - copy pasting comments I will never ever

79:10 - kind of what it is so great job on
79:14 - actually going and making a channel I
79:16 - could help you with patreon but I will

79:39 - and be making great viral videos with it
79:42 - okay you don't need equipment that's
79:43 - stopping you you're looking in the right
79:45 - you're looking in the wrong place I had
79:48 - about I think I've bought and sold about
79:51 - three cameras so far three really really
79:55 - expensive cameras I started off with
79:56 - Canon t3i no two cameras Canon t3i okay
80:01 - DSLR and I thought that was the best
80:05 - camera ever and guess what I did with
80:08 - that nothing okay I'm like I'm gonna
80:11 - start a YouTube channel I'm gonna do
80:13 - photography
80:13 - I got pumped up I bought it and nothing
80:17 - happened took a few shots of my you know
80:20 - family my sister my guitar and that was
80:23 - it okay and then two years later two
80:26 - three years later I'm like I'm gonna
80:28 - really I'm really gonna do it now okay I
80:30 - watched some motivational videos and I'm
80:33 - like YouTube is the thing and I'm gonna
80:36 - do it so then I'm like since I'm going
80:38 - serious now I'm gonna buy Canon like a
80:42 - really good camera
80:43 - so then I got an 80 deep all right it's
80:45 - like right that's the latest version and
80:49 - I got that zero zero okay and that
80:55 - camera was like $1,500 okay with like
80:57 - packages and stuff like that and I had
81:00 - zero videos made with that and again
81:03 - took some pictures and that was it right
81:05 - nothing I have nothing to show for my
81:10 - $1500 and I thought it was the camera
81:12 - and then a year ago this guy right here
81:18 - right this guy okay this guy here okay
81:25 - he inspired me to start a YouTube
81:28 - channel
81:28 - finally all right and I've always liked
81:33 - never started on YouTube because I
81:35 - thought I wasn't good on video okay
81:40 - and I wasn't okay I sucked at it it was
81:43 - so awkward if you look at my like first
81:45 - videos like I cringe right now like I I
81:48 - can't watch them but I went through it
81:51 - and now I have 57 videos on my channel
81:54 - and guess what was like like guess what
81:59 - camera I used to shoot that what
82:02 - happened no no okay okay
82:06 - it's a can't like what is it what is it
82:09 - c920 okay logitech c920 this camera
82:12 - right right here and it's 50 dollars on
82:15 - amazon right now right 50 or 60 versus
82:19 - $1500 DSLR and i had a prime lens I had
82:23 - like two or three lenses so it's never
82:27 - about the equipment it's always you
82:35 - that was great but all the videos you've
82:38 - made let's just talk about the results
82:41 - maybe he's like if you had better camera
82:43 - but do you know do you see a change in
82:46 - your viewership
82:48 - did you see a change in your viewers
82:49 - like for example maybe did your viewers
82:51 - increase or decrease after you switch to
82:53 - a c920 for your channel no right I mean
82:57 - I started off with the c920 right never
82:59 - i I never created anything with my
83:02 - camera that's what I'm trying to get at
83:04 - right it's never about the camera it's
83:07 - never about some external thing it's
83:11 - always about you
83:12 - if you can create if if you take action
83:14 - and you create value nobody's gonna care
83:16 - about my camera and sound and stuff like
83:19 - that in the beginning they'll understand
83:22 - a good let me chip in here a good
83:26 - example of this is my friend and I we
83:29 - went to this live event and it's like a
83:32 - seminar and basically it's a lot about
83:34 - self development and in this seminar one
83:37 - of the exercises they gave us was you
83:41 - take a toothpick and then you go on the
83:42 - street and you see what kind of thing
83:44 - you can get in return for that toothpick
83:46 - and we went out in the street and we
83:51 - would have to trade it up so for example
83:52 - you have to go to people random
83:54 - strangers and you have to give them a
83:56 - toothpick and you have to go hey what
83:58 - would you trade me for this toothpick
84:00 - and so you have to go through a lot of
84:02 - like people who might not be interested
84:05 - in giving you anything but then you run
84:06 - into people who give you things so
84:08 - ultimately we came back with quite a few
84:12 - things like I had a Victoria Secret cent
84:16 - I had one cent at one point I had like
84:19 - some Leafs I had somebody gave me a
84:23 - hoodie and I came back with that and
84:27 - then later when we were in that room
84:29 - there were a few people who didn't have
84:31 - who didn't get anything back when they
84:32 - came most of the people had something
84:34 - that they got from other people but
84:36 - there were a few people who didn't have
84:39 - anything in return they just had the
84:41 - toothpick and then the host said if you
84:45 - came back with just a toothpick what
84:47 - does that say about you and
84:48 - also he said something that changed our
84:50 - lives he said what you got in return
84:58 - toothpick is useless right toothpick has
85:00 - no meaning and he said what you got in
85:03 - return wasn't cause of the toothpick it
85:06 - was cause if you and that's a number one
85:09 - tangible example of that people want to
85:12 - you know if you give value to people
85:14 - you'll get something in return and what
85:16 - we gave those people was like just a
85:18 - good conversation maybe right and just
85:21 - good vibes that's all and this is what
85:24 - we got back in return different you know
85:26 - a bunch of things for a toothpick so
85:30 - there were people who got literally
85:32 - dollars back for the toothpick okay so
85:35 - remember that you can give if you can't
85:38 - make money when you have no money you
85:42 - can't make money when you have money
85:45 - very important okay did you guys catch
85:49 - that if you can't make money when you
85:52 - have no money you can't make money when
85:53 - you have money all right
85:54 - same way with content creation same way
85:57 - with getting value same way with
85:59 - building online business if you can't
86:00 - make a following when you have no
86:02 - following you can't make a bigger
86:04 - following when you do have a following
86:06 - so hopefully take away something from
86:09 - that Josh you're doing a great job this
86:12 - is probably gonna be the best most
86:14 - valuable thing you're gonna get in a
86:17 - long like you know I think this would be
86:19 - very about valuable for me if I was on
86:21 - the receiving end of this and take that
86:25 - to heart and roll with it okay basically
86:27 - crush it what you do at the bottom
86:29 - determines what you you can become at
86:32 - the top yes okay he says using the
86:35 - camera on my iPhone and
86:38 - perfect youth that's it that's all you
86:40 - need perfect
