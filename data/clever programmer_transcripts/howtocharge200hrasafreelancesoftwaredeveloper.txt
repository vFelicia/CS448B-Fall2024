00:00 - I don't know about you but like okay let
00:01 - me ask you a question would you rather
00:02 - make $5,000 working 160 hours or would
00:06 - you rather make four thousand dollars
00:08 - working 20 hours this time right so the
00:14 - overall money isn't the goal but
00:17 - increasing our hourly rate in a really
00:19 - intelligent way that's the goal right
00:22 - that's the whole point of why people
00:24 - start businesses because it allows them
00:26 - to leverage their time that is a win
00:30 - right right that's a huge win because
00:33 - now you can scale it because now you can
00:37 - get another client and let's another
00:40 - client that's another 2400 another
00:42 - client that might be another thousand or
00:44 - 1500 but you're giving up the short-term
00:48 - but you're getting a huge win in the
00:52 - long term because in the long term over
00:54 - the course of a year of you actually
00:56 - doing this and actually making sure your
00:59 - clients are getting good results
01:02 - managing them getting testimonials and
01:05 - completing the whole project what it
01:07 - could look like is you're profiting
01:09 - $4,000 a month
01:12 - okay profit $4,000 a month or $2,000 a
01:17 - month whatever it may be but what I want
01:19 - to think about what's important is that
01:21 - it's taking up almost none of your time
01:24 - right normally you would spend 40 80 you
01:30 - would spend about 160 hours making this
01:32 - much income and you go from 160 hours to
01:37 - let's say five hours of work per week
01:42 - attempting you go for 160 hours to 20
01:46 - hours you understand
01:48 - so let's do the math on this 4000
01:51 - divided by 160 hours that's $25 an hour
01:56 - now let's go four thousand dollars
02:00 - divided by 20 hours do you see that your
02:06 - hourly rate is actually really really
02:08 - high right your hourly rate is two
02:15 - hundred dollars an hour so so right so
02:23 - so basically this is what it means to
02:26 - leverage your expertise and your time
02:29 - for something I mean so always be
02:31 - thinking in terms of your hourly rate of
02:33 - what you're doing when I send out an
02:35 - email to a lot of people on our email
02:39 - list and then I make a youtube video or
02:41 - whatever
02:42 - there's a lot of leverage there that I
02:44 - have because there's a lot of people at
02:46 - the end so the the one hour of my time
02:49 - in that case is actually worth a lot
02:50 - more you see so this is the leverage
02:54 - that you want to be able to get and
02:56 - honestly this is what I did I would hit
03:00 - up equivalent of me high I hit up
03:03 - another developer I hit up a few
03:04 - developers and I would just say you need
03:07 - to have a job posting otherwise you
03:09 - can't hit them up but if you have a job
03:12 - posting you just hit them up and you say
03:13 - hey um this is the project I'm working
03:17 - on let's just set up a 5-minute call and
03:20 - so in each person I would get on a
03:22 - 5-minute call with after about three or
03:25 - four interviews and hire two developers
03:27 - and those two developers were working on
03:31 - lots of my freelancing projects go
03:34 - all-in on business and business
03:37 - it's like business I love more than
03:39 - anything I love people more than
03:41 - anything
03:41 - so coding I as as much as I love
03:45 - software development as much as I
03:47 - actually love coding because I do really
03:49 - enjoy it I get lost in it but I'm doing
03:50 - it I actually enjoyed this interaction
03:52 - you and I are having right now Tony and
03:54 - I enjoyed the interactions like I'm
03:56 - having when every person in this group
03:58 - way more then I enjoy actually sitting
04:02 - on my computer in coding so at the end
04:05 - of the day think about how crazy that is
04:09 - my business is doing well
04:12 - not because of coding is actually doing
04:15 - well because of humans and people right
04:19 - all of the businesses that anybody goes
04:21 - on to build have to deal with people in
04:24 - humans at the end of the day and we
04:25 - forget that at some level so as long as
04:30 - you're like connected with people and
04:31 - humans you can start business and almost
04:34 - anything and be pretty successful the
04:37 - whole point of me sharing hey start
04:39 - documenting your coding journey like I
04:41 - don't care if you start documenting your
04:43 -  learning how to cooking journey
04:46 - you know or like starting to play golf
04:48 - journey or whatever journey you want to
04:50 - document traveling to places it's hard
04:54 - to beat up somebody in Hong Kong journey
04:56 - like whatever it is but the most
04:59 - important thing is building a habit of
05:02 - sharing these things putting it out
05:04 - there like putting value in the world
05:06 - and then over time you see the
05:09 - difference that happens and you get
05:10 - people behind you and then you can
05:11 - actually turn the data into anything I
05:13 - think that real estate is really old
05:16 - right and stock market is really old and
05:19 - people understand those concepts really
05:20 - well that's why everybody's trying to
05:22 - put their money in 401 K to try to put
05:24 - their money into like some kind of
05:26 - buying a house right I know a lot of
05:29 - these things because these things are
05:30 - understood for like thousands of years
05:33 - but I think people are not understanding
05:35 - is that there's incredible like those
05:40 - are physical assets right those are
05:42 - physical assets but I think the world is
05:45 - heading towards lots of digital assets
05:47 - okay yeah how sometimes you're asked to
05:50 - fill it nice so we're heading towards
05:55 - where there's insane amount of power in
05:57 - digital assets each digital asset could
06:00 - serve you for the rest of your life like
06:02 - for example take something like Abdullah
06:05 - made a video today on something about
06:07 - turtles right on coding and it's on
06:10 - YouTube and you maybe made it a few days
06:12 - ago whatever the point is that that will
06:15 - serve as asset and it'll provide value
06:18 - to people because the point of a house
06:20 - is that it provides value to a person or
06:22 - value to people his coding video over
06:26 - time will provide value to people and
06:30 - imagine how much value would provide ten
06:33 - days from now fifty days from now
06:35 - thousand days from now four years from
06:37 - now ten years from now 30 years from now
06:40 - I have a I have a feeling that I'll
06:44 - provide a lot of that stuff will provide
06:47 - way more value than almost any real
06:50 - estate that you could purchase would
06:52 - provide built up and provide more value
06:56 - to the world than any amount of real
06:59 - estate because people will if you have
07:00 - real estate you'll have like two people
07:03 - physically living in there that's great
07:04 - you're helping two people this he could
07:08 - help thousand ten thousand fifty
07:12 - thousand or a million people over the
07:15 - course of one to twenty years so
07:18 - logically just makes sense as is
07:21 - providing more value to the market he's
07:23 - gonna get some of that value back right
07:27 - the thing that started clicking in my
07:29 - mind when I started doing YouTube was
07:30 - like one day of my time and then it
07:34 - would say ten days of people's watch
07:36 - time and I'm like holy crap it almost
07:39 - felt like I was time travel
07:40 - like one day of my time could move the
07:43 - world forward by ten days time and then
07:46 - eventually it was like one day of my
07:48 - time could move the world forward by 50
07:50 - days of time so then it's just um if I'm
07:52 - providing people ten years of value with
07:59 - one year of my effort it only makes
08:02 - sense that my income will go to what my
08:07 - income will be in ten years in one year
08:12 - you see what I'm saying
08:15 - so that's kind of my thoughts unlike
08:18 - that lots of the digital assets and
08:20 - that's why I even say I have lots of
08:24 - different I have different opinions on
08:25 - this but I think for me I would be I
08:28 - personally would go a lot into digital
08:30 - assets creating things and documenting
08:32 - what I'm learning wherever I am in my
08:35 - life because I know those will serve and
08:38 - provide value forever and they're super
08:39 - lean it
08:40 - it doesn't need any investment like I
08:43 - don't have to put down or if you made a
08:46 - video Tony you don't have to put down
08:47 - two hundred thousand dollars to buy a
08:49 - videos right you can actually just put
08:51 - out a video today for free not putting
08:55 - any money down so it's kind of some of
08:57 - my thoughts on that when you up if
09:02 - you're up twice as much as the
09:03 - other person is up once as much
09:05 - in a year you will you will learn the
09:10 - things in six months of your time that
09:11 - will take other person one year add that
09:14 - over a long period of time one years now
09:17 - you're saving a year right so I think it
09:21 - starts to add up and it has helped me a
09:24 - lot when it comes to
09:25 - so rather type and then actually also
09:28 - using fin I don't know if you guys know
09:31 - them but if you want to be a ninja
09:34 - encoding go down the rabbit hole event
09:37 - that has certain point ly go down that
09:40 - rabbit hole at your own risk
