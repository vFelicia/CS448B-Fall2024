05:04 - not try ever again in your whole life
05:06 - it's over if you're 12 it's over for you
05:10 - if you're 14 it's over for you
05:12 - if you're like 30 it's over for you you
05:15 - have to start coding when you're one
05:17 - years old okay right when you're born
05:20 - like right out of the womb you just have
05:23 - to start coding if you miss that little
05:27 - window right where you're being birthed
05:29 - into the world you can't you can't do it
05:33 - anymore okay coding then is not for you
05:35 - and you're not going to be successful
05:37 - you're just going to be a failure your
05:38 - family's gonna laugh at you your friends
05:40 - are gonna make fun of you and the school
05:42 - system is gonna fail you
05:54 - man God our arm gets tired
05:58 - I gotta get a I got to get some kind of
06:01 - thing to hold this phone I got to grab
06:04 - one of these people so they can hold my
06:06 - phone for me actually
06:11 - okay so my earlier answer I was just
06:16 - kidding if you're if you're older than
06:21 - one years old you can still learn how to
06:24 - code okay you can okay there we go
06:28 - you can still learn how to code if
06:31 - you're older than one years old it's not
06:34 - over for you okay there are people
06:36 - behind me they're like scared to cross
06:38 - it's okay go ahead cross hi if you're 20
06:46 - or if you're 12 or if you're 14 look it
06:49 - doesn't matter you can learn how to code
06:51 - and you can start building apps and you
06:54 - can start young like why not get a head
06:56 - start
06:56 - why would you limit yourself by saying
06:58 - something like that that I'm 12 can i
07:01 - still code I mean all you're gonna do is
07:04 - like instead of learning how to code at
07:06 - 12 you're just gonna wait till you're 25
07:08 - and then have and then be like am I
07:11 - ready to code now that I'm 25 why not
07:14 - just start now right why not start right
07:17 - now
07:20 - just get a head start and if you're old
07:23 - why come why waste time complaining
07:26 - right if you're old why waste time
07:30 - complaining because then let's say
07:32 - you're 30 and you don't start coding and
07:33 - then you're 40 and you don't start
07:35 - coding and then you're gonna be seeing
07:36 - the same thing I wish I started earlier
07:38 - then when you're 50 the same dude who's
07:40 - 50 is gonna be complaining why didn't I
07:42 - start when I was 40 the dude who's 60 is
07:45 - gonna be complaining why'd I why didn't
07:47 - I start when I was 50 so just start
07:52 - right now write it this is your your hi
07:54 - hi this is like you're as young as you
07:57 - you know you're as young as you're gonna
07:59 - get right now you're not gonna get
08:01 - younger right so start doing it right
08:03 - now and start learning it yeah it's
08:09 - never too late to start coding you know
08:11 - that's what I said it's never too late I
08:13 - mean unless you're like 99 and you're
08:16 - guaranteed to die when you hit 100 maybe
08:19 - then you want to spend that time doing
08:21 - something else but like seriously if you
08:24 - want to start coding it's not do you
08:26 - know like age or whatever shouldn't stop
08:29 - you okay so yeah I'm kidding
08:32 - if you're older than one you can start
08:34 - to code just messing around with you
08:36 - guys
08:44 - I've been coding for like three years
08:46 - three four years now
08:48 - yeah check it out all right this looks
08:51 - so good looks so good
08:54 - I just got it right now amazing barber
08:58 - shops all high in LA you need a basic
09:04 - Python class there's no better basic
09:07 - Python class then my free Python course
09:11 - ok go to clever programmer comm it's the
09:14 - absolute best Python course if I should
09:17 - charge a lot of money for it but I don't
09:19 - I don't even charge a penny I give it to
09:22 - you for free it's the course that I
09:23 - could easily sell for like three four or
09:25 - five hundred bucks but I don't it's my
09:27 - free course free gift to you guys we'll
09:30 - take advantage of it you know go and you
09:33 - learn you learn some interactive
09:34 - exercises quizzes my hands-on way of
09:37 - teaching and then also you build
09:39 - projects so go do it coding for five
09:44 - years cool right it's cool you're coding
09:47 - for five years yours don't matter as
09:49 - much as your skill and your it doesn't
09:53 - matter as much as your skill and who you
09:55 - work with and what kind of things you've
09:57 - built okay so don't let your years hold
10:01 - you back or give you that giant ego
10:04 - because like for example when I was
10:05 - starting out yeah right there I'm a man
10:09 - when I was starting out you see like
10:12 - yeah I didn't spend so many years when I
10:14 - was learning to code but guess what I
10:17 - was spending 16-hour days 18-hour days
10:19 - for other people this spend one hour a
10:21 - day so of course it's gonna take him ten
10:23 - years huh spending 18 hours okay so if
10:25 - you spend more time or work smarter you
10:29 - can learn the skill a lot faster
10:36 - yeah I will be doing tutorial on Django
10:38 - and I will be doing a tutorial on flask
10:40 - and that will actually be part of my
10:42 - course called create outs with Python
10:44 - and land your first client okay this is
10:46 - the course where I teach you how to
10:47 - create absolute Python but more
10:49 - importantly build portfolios and land
10:51 - your first clients this you can start
10:53 - making an income okay so it's
10:54 - freelancing or whether you're coaching
10:56 - clients
10:57 - I want to be able to teach you that I
10:59 - want to be able to show you things like
11:00 - what's the difference between a
11:02 - freelancer and a full-time developer I
11:05 - also want to help you decide which
11:07 - lifestyle is right for you I also want
11:10 - to help you decide what field in Python
11:12 - is right for you is a data science is it
11:14 - machine learning is it analytics or is
11:18 - it web development which one is it okay
11:19 - so all those things I'm gonna cover in
11:22 - the course with you guys and I'll teach
11:25 - you the technical skills and I'll tell
11:27 - you where you can go and get those
11:29 - clients okay so you're interested in
11:31 - getting this go click that link below in
11:33 - the description and then you can go up
11:35 - and sign up for that course
11:40 - right now well what I'm allowing you
11:43 - guys to sign up for is it's called my
11:47 - VIP waitlist
11:48 - so when you sign up for it then I will
11:51 - send you as soon as the course opens I
11:54 - will notify you also I'll send you a
11:56 - free gift a bonus if you get on the VIP
11:58 - waitlist which is how I became a
12:01 - software developer in less than three
12:02 - months and I'll give you all those
12:04 - resources for free programming can it
12:08 - make me rich I mean it depends rich is a
12:11 - relative term for me rich is like I want
12:13 - to be in seven eight figure mark and
12:15 - then I'll be rich but for you if around
12:19 - like high five figures or six figures is
12:22 - rich then yet being a developer being a
12:25 - Python developer does earn you around 90
12:27 - K to 100k a year or even more before I
12:31 - started making a channel on teaching you
12:34 - guys how to become a software developer
12:35 - I was earning around six figures higher
12:38 - like the lower end six figures from
12:41 - coding from consulting and from
12:43 - freelancing so then I'm like let me
12:45 - teach it to you guys they'll help you
12:47 - get those skills fast like I did before
12:53 - my course starts you don't really need
12:55 - any skill if you have basic Python
12:57 - skills that's good go through my free
12:59 - Python course on clever programmer calm
13:01 - it's called learn Python by building
13:03 - projects so go through that if you want
13:05 - to prepare thank you
13:09 - I'll come to India at some point you
13:10 - know because a lot of my fans are in
13:12 - India so why not I'll go and do public
13:14 - speaking there
13:17 - which one is better freelancing or
13:20 - full-time for me it's freelancing for
13:22 - you it could be a full-time in the
13:23 - course I'll help you decide which one is
13:25 - better for you okay
13:26 - [Music]
13:29 - for me I started earning money in three
13:32 - months and I want to put you guys on a
13:34 - path to start either earning money in
13:36 - three to six months so that's my goal
13:38 - for you I want you to start earning
13:39 - dollars okay because a lot of these
13:41 - online courses will take money out of
13:44 - your pockets but not put it back into
13:46 - your pocket what I want to do is put
13:48 - money back into your pocket okay so if
13:50 - you join my course I'm gonna teach you
13:52 - how you can start earning as well
13:54 - there's no limit on how many people can

14:01 - then it's shut down again so if you miss
14:04 - your opportunity to join you won't be
14:05 - able to join it again till whenever I
14:07 - launch it you know next year sometime
14:10 - the course is called create apps and
14:13 - land your first client with Python okay
14:17 - yeah I'll be launching it like early
14:19 - November
14:21 - [Music]
14:27 - coach Adam e courses are great I've made
14:30 - a few videos on it LLL start in early
14:33 - November how to earn money money with
14:37 - programming skills make something that

14:42 - can you get started with this
14:43 - click the describe click the link in the
14:45 - description okay so go to the YouTube
14:47 - description and click that link the link

15:12 - where do babies come from can't tell you
15:15 - the secret join the course and I'll call
15:16 - you in there
15:21 - what is the difference between Shree
15:22 - house and my course treehouse doesn't
15:24 - tell you where to go to start
15:25 - freelancing treehouses and teach you how
15:27 - to start getting your first clients
15:29 - treehouse doesn't teach you negotiation
15:31 - skills how to up your salary how to have
15:34 - lots of clients how to absolutely fire
15:36 - your clients and a hot wife firing
15:38 - actually makes you more money
15:39 - so those things are actually not in the
15:42 - team treehouse courses moves strictly
15:44 - technical okay and also eight doesn't
15:47 - it's not completely for beginners it's
15:49 - like pretty advanced that's what I've
15:51 - heard from a lot of the people who went
15:53 - through the treehouse course they're
15:54 - like it starts off completely beginner
15:56 - and then it gets way too advanced so
15:59 - what I want to do for you guys is make
16:00 - it so it's not too advanced and also I
16:02 - want to focus more on you guys being
16:04 - able to make money
16:06 - [Music]
16:12 - [Music]
16:15 - I have a lot more free time now compared
16:18 - to when I was working full time and I
16:20 - get to live whatever like look at this
16:22 - I'm in Hollywood below or just like
16:24 - chillin like look these are an actor or
16:26 - names like people travel from different
16:28 - countries to come here and I get to live
16:31 - here if I want to and then pretty soon
16:33 - I'll fly out to New Zealand live in New
16:35 - Zealand for a little bit and then I'll
16:37 - fly out to some other places I couldn't
16:39 - do that before and that's something that
16:42 - being a freelancer allowed me to do with
16:44 - Python like the trick is you increase
16:49 - your hourly income a lot and what that
16:53 - does is like the same amount of money
16:54 - you would have made and ten hours of
16:56 - working now you make in two or three
16:58 - hours is working and then you could save
17:01 - you save seven hours every day huh hi
17:06 - Beast nice maybe I'll come to see you
17:11 - one thing I want to do with you guys and
17:14 - let me know what you think of it what I
17:15 - want to do is go to different cities and
17:17 - do public speaking events where I see
17:19 - you guys live and I want to make these
17:21 - events free for you guys to join so like
17:23 - let's say I come to your country
17:26 - III get a place where I set it up for
17:29 - free and then I would like you guys join
17:31 - and just show up like that's all you
17:33 - guys have to do is that something you
17:34 - guys would be interested in like me
17:36 - coming to your city or your country live
17:38 - and then like doing a live event there
17:41 - because I've been thinking about that
17:43 - and something I actually want to like
17:45 - start doing at some point
17:52 - yeah Abel says yes cool Oscar okay yeah
17:58 - I think it'd be dope I'm gonna start
18:01 - walking around a little bit more I
18:03 - didn't walk around much because the Sun
18:05 - was hitting me the right way cool mister
18:07 - nobody says I'm living in LA yeah like
18:10 - what I want to be doing is going
18:11 - traveling and then just going to weeks
18:13 - two weeks two weeks and then hitting
18:14 - your guys's cities but if you launch
18:17 - that course in October I might either
18:19 - launch it late October or early November
18:21 - so be on the lookout that's why it's so
18:23 - important to be on the VIP waitlist so
18:26 - you can be the first one to know as soon
18:27 - as I launch it because I really don't
18:29 - want you guys to miss out on this
18:30 - opportunity
18:32 - I wouldn't worry so much about Kotlin
18:35 - but Ginga is very useful so go at Django
18:38 - don't worry so much about Kotlin
18:47 - what can you do to get my course get on
18:50 - my VIP waitlist and I'll let you know to
18:55 - get on the waitlist what you essentially
18:57 - need to do is go to my description click
19:00 - that link in my description and that
19:04 - will get you on the list like go click
19:08 - that link then go put your email in and
19:10 - then you're gonna be on my VIP waitlist
19:12 - you can also go to my website clever
19:14 - programmer comm and I think I have
19:18 - somewhere like when you're about to
19:19 - click away it pops it up
19:21 - [Music]
19:27 - cool Cody Cara thank you for being
19:29 - patient because what this course is
19:31 - going through a complete like makeover
19:34 - which means that you're gonna have all
19:36 - the old material plus all the new
19:39 - material I'm gonna add so everybody
19:41 - who's in this course already and got in
19:43 - when it was cheaper you guys just get
19:45 - like a ton of value for absolutely
19:48 - free
19:48 - you know because you guys got in earlier
19:50 - so when I put in any like new stuff you
19:53 - guys just get to get it ok so that's
19:55 - what this course is going through and
19:57 - it's gonna be there when I real aunch it
20:01 - so everybody who joined it earlier will
20:04 - get access to this stuff for free
20:10 - some of the questions could you guys
20:11 - please say it again because when it goes
20:13 - away I can't I can't see him anymore
20:17 - when to start with pycharm
20:20 - how to start with pycharm give it a few
20:23 - months basically hold on if I want to
20:25 - complete Python within two months how
20:26 - much time will I have to spend per day
20:28 - you don't complete Python it's like how
20:31 - long will it take me to complete English
20:32 - again the point of learning a language
20:35 - is you can do something with it when I
20:37 - learned English it wasn't like oh I just
20:39 - need to learn English and then that's it
20:41 - my life is complete once I learned
20:43 - English then I got a job in America then
20:46 - I went to college in America then I
20:49 - started a YouTube channel where I could
20:51 - speak English okay so it's about what
20:55 - you can do with that language so with
20:56 - Python once you learn it you want to
20:58 - build projects with it and there's no
21:00 - such thing as complete a language I'll
21:07 - expect my course would be between three
21:09 - to five hundred bucks okay it's not a
21:12 - cheap course but it's something that is
21:14 - gonna be worth your investment okay so
21:16 - if you need to save up start saving up
21:19 - right now like this is easily a course
21:21 - that will give you ten times that on the
21:23 - investment even if you get one clients
21:26 - okay even one client it's essentially a
21:30 - few hours of your work
21:32 - [Music]
