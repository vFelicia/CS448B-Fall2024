00:01 - - What is up you beautiful person?
00:03 - This is Qazi here from
cleverprogrammer.com,
00:05 - today bringing you the top four
00:08 - dying programming languages in 2019
00:12 - and going on to 2020.
00:13 - So let's talk about this.
00:14 - What the hell is happening?
00:15 - Now first, few things I just wanna address
00:17 - before we continue.
00:20 - The reason why you would
wanna know these things
00:22 - is so you can help decide what part,
00:25 - where you wanna head
with your career, okay?
00:28 - And obviously other things
like one programming language
00:31 - doesn't ultimately matter,
00:33 - because when you're working on a project
00:35 - sometimes you're using
multiple programming languages.
00:37 - But I think that this is still
something really fascinating
00:40 - and interesting to talk about,
00:41 - so we're gonna talk about it.
00:42 - In this video, we're gonna focus on data,
00:44 - analytics and trends in Google,
00:48 - not my personal opinion, okay?
00:51 - Because my personal
opinion doesn't matter,
00:53 - but let's look at what the
behavior of the world is
00:56 - and use that,
00:58 - and that's why we're gonna
be using the PYPL index,
01:01 - the Popularity of a
Programming Language index,
01:03 - instead of the TIOBE index,
01:05 - which is the T-I-O-B-E index.
01:07 - And now I'm gonna talk about
01:08 - why you should be using it.
01:10 - PYPL is a leading indicator as opposed to
01:13 - a lagging indicator, okay.
01:15 - For example, it says
here on the PYPL platform
01:18 - which is pretty smart, and they say that
01:20 - you know how TIOBE actually use searches,
01:23 - and comes up with this index,
01:25 - is based on how many web pages there are
01:28 - for a given language.
01:29 - Well, if you take a language like C,
01:33 - it says, it ca...
01:35 - Objective-C programming has over
01:37 - 20,000,000 pages on the web.
01:39 - While C programming has only 11,000,000.
01:43 - This is explains why
Objective-C has a high
01:46 - T-I-O-B-E Tiobe ranking.
01:49 - But who is reading those
Objective-C webpages?
01:51 - Hardly anyone.
01:53 - According to Google Trends
data, an Objective-C
01:55 - programming is searched 30 times less
01:57 - than C programming.
01:58 - In fact, the use of programming
when you TIOBE index,
02:01 - is misleading.
02:02 - So, I agree with this, okay?
02:06 - It's misleading, you wanna
look at what the trends
02:08 - are now, instead of a lagging
indicator like webpages.
02:14 - So for example, if we go to this,
02:16 - and I'm gonna be going
in an order, all right?
02:18 - So if we go to this, you can see the base
02:20 - on a popularity of a language worldwide,
02:23 - where languages rank.
02:25 - So right now, you have Python at the top,
02:27 - then you have Java,
then you got JavaScript
02:29 - and then goes on, so
on and so forth, okay?
02:33 - And where the trend is headed,
02:34 - so they're using Google Trends.
02:37 - So now, if I actually type in Python
02:40 - and I select programming language,
02:43 - and then I type in JavaScript,
02:46 - and I select the programming language,
02:48 - you can see, and I choose the last
02:53 - five years.
02:56 - Notice what happens, right?
02:57 - Python is the blue, JavaScript is the red.
02:59 - So the JavaScript is winning in the start
03:02 - and Python is here, but as you keep going
03:04 - further and further, you see that Python
03:07 - ultimately dwarfs out JavaScript.
03:09 - Now you might be thinking,
wait this can't be true?
03:12 - Here's another way to look at it.
03:14 - You can go to YouTube and
you can actually type in
03:19 - Python and look at the
views on the tutorials
03:24 - in the last year, all right?
03:25 - This should prove it to you.
03:26 - You have 8,300,000 views for this
03:29 - Python course.
03:30 - You have 4,000,000 views
in the last six months
03:32 - for this Programming with Mosh course.
03:35 - You can see my beautiful face
here, in my tutorial here.
03:39 - I have a five hour long
tutorial that I put on this.
03:42 - Now, if you do the same
thing with JavaScript,
03:45 - you'll notice that the
views are way lower.
03:49 - 1,800,000, 1,100,000, 547,000.
03:53 - So let me propose a question to you.
03:56 - Why would there be less
people searching for something
03:59 - if there was a higher demand for it?
04:02 - There wouldn't, right?
04:03 - So, the demand is directly
correlated with the amount
04:07 - of people searching for something.
04:08 - So YouTube, Google Trends, these
are pretty good indicators.
04:11 - So now with the facts
established, let's get into
04:15 - the top four dying programming languages,
04:20 - and how you can use that
data to make a better
04:23 - decision in your life.
04:26 - Top four, Ruby.
04:29 - So Ruby is a
04:32 - programming language that's more
04:33 - on the decline.
04:34 - Will it completely die off?
04:37 - We don't know.
04:38 - Are there still jobs available
for it, and developers
04:41 - getting paid for it?
04:42 - Absolutely, but it is certainly
not on a higher trend.
04:48 - The growth of it is actually on the more
04:51 - declining end, all right?
04:53 - So you can see here
based on the popularity,
04:55 - Ruby is ranking 12th,
and it's on the decline
04:59 - and is losing its share,
and it has a downward trend.
05:03 - If we go here and we type in Ruby,
05:08 - so programming language, we
can actually search this up.
05:12 - And even though this is
not a good data to look at,
05:15 - but you can see, it's either
staying stagnant or declining.
05:19 - It's definitely not
05:22 - growing.
05:23 - There was a time where
people were searching it up,
05:26 - and there were some..
05:28 - there was a little incline,
but that was back in 2006,
05:32 - and since then, it's
been on a steady decline,
05:34 - and now it's even more so.
05:37 - Okay? And we can, we can
confirm this by typing in Ruby
05:42 - and what you'll see here
is, one year ago 207,000.
05:46 - Whereas on the Python, it
was 8,000,000 views, right?
05:48 - So that should just make
it very very dead simple.
05:52 - So that's the top four
dying programming language.
05:55 - Now, let's move on to number three.
05:58 - Objective-C.
06:00 - So this programming language certainly not
06:03 - on the incline and has a downward trend,
06:06 - and it's a pretty big
programming language.
06:08 - So let's type that in,
Objective-C, and here comes
06:13 - the programming language
which is different
06:15 - than just the search
term, and you can see that
06:17 - the popularity of the...
06:19 - it was at one since 2004,
06:22 - and it's still at a one.
06:26 - Now let's take a look on
YouTube, and type in Objective-C.
06:31 - So there was a tutorial by
Derek Banas four years ago
06:34 - and that 215,000 views but
unfortunately beyond that,
06:40 - there doesn't seem to be much
of a demand for Objective-C
06:43 - at all, and it is one of
the programming languages
06:47 - that is dying.
06:48 - So if you're using it, probably stop.
06:51 - Go on to something else.
06:52 - Obviously, unless you
have a job in Objective-C
06:54 - then you should stay there.
06:56 - That's three.
06:57 - Number two dying programming
language is Perl.
07:03 - So let's take a look at
what's happening with Perl.
07:06 - Perl is right here.
07:07 - Certainly on a downward
trend, and if we type
07:09 - that in,
07:11 - so Perl was pretty popular around 2004
07:15 - and then it had a very very sharp decline.
07:17 - This is a really stark
contrast that we see over here,
07:21 - because you go from that
popular, to that dying.
07:24 - I mean that's insane, right?
07:26 - And then Python just whoosh.
07:28 - I mean this is flying,
07:31 - flying baby.
07:32 - Number one, staying
number one consistently.
07:37 - So that's a situation
that's happened with Perl
07:40 - unfortunately, and Perl you
definitely kind of wanna stay
07:44 - away from it.
07:45 - This article by Skywell
Software, this is a company
07:48 - that wrote it.
07:50 - And it says basically, "Is Perl Dead?".
07:53 - "The story of Perl is a very
sad one. As is went through,
07:57 - from one of the top programming
languages, but as time
08:00 - went on, it became viewed as
a write only language, which
08:03 - triggered its demise.
08:05 - Early on, it was viewed as
very useful and pragmatic,
08:09 - but it came with a lot caveats.
08:12 - The creators of Perl
started to pile on features,
08:14 - but did not plan out how
all of them will be synced.
08:18 - The developer community noticed
this problem and created
08:20 - Perl 6, but it was not enough
to keep Perl in demand.
08:24 - In the end, it had a good
run, but it would be better
08:28 - to forget about this language
and focus on something
08:30 - that is more popular now."
08:32 - Really harsh to read such
a thing about a programming
08:36 - language but, it is the
truth and these are facts,
08:39 - and this is data, and numbers don't lie.
08:42 - So that is Perl.
08:44 - And in the number one
dying programming language,
08:49 - JavaScript.
08:49 - I'm kidding, I'm kidding .
08:51 - Visual Basic.
08:52 - Okay so, let's take a look
at what's happening with
08:55 - Visual Basic.
08:57 - We have a downward trend,
08:59 - the order that I have, by the way
09:01 - of saying these, is not in any particular
09:03 - order, but so you know it's
not like this is the most dying
09:08 - out of all of them, but
Visual Basic which was pretty
09:11 - heavily used and has, I mean
it's so much popularity.
09:14 - In 2004, it was at 100 out
of 100 people were using
09:19 - Visual Basic, but then
just look at what happened
09:22 - and look at the decline.
09:24 - I mean this is insane, and
now it's a dying programming
09:27 - language.
09:28 - That's why, what you
wanna do is you wanna pick
09:30 - a pro...
09:31 - See it's not just about
programming language right,
09:33 - but then when you, but
whatever programming language
09:36 - that you actually choose,
will morph and will define
09:41 - what your career comes out to be.
09:43 - I mean if you're a Python
guy, you're gonna be learning
09:46 - frameworks like Django,
and it's gonna be defining
09:49 - kind of what you do.
09:50 - You're gonna be doing things
with data analysis more
09:52 - and more, because you're
gonna be hearing about it.
09:54 - There are more libraries about it.
09:56 - So you're gonna be doing
that more and more.
09:58 - If you're a JavaScript guy,
you're gonna be working
09:59 - on Node.js, and you're gonna
be doing a lot of the front-end
10:02 - stuff and all.
10:03 - Like by default right, lots
of the projects and tutorials
10:06 - by default are gonna make
your behavior going that way.
10:10 - So why you have to be careful
about the language you keep
10:15 - close to your heart, is because
it can drive a lot of your
10:19 - future behavior.
10:20 - For example, my friend Tenzin.
10:23 - He's really good at JavaScript,
he picked JavaScript,
10:25 - but he's more of a front-end
and a full stack developer.
10:29 - Whereas with Python, I
primarily focus on most
10:34 - of the back-end, so I'm a really strong
10:36 - back-end developer, right?
10:38 - I...
10:38 - And my data-analysis
game is pretty strong,
10:41 - so all of those things for me
became stronger, and my friend
10:44 - end is weaker.
10:45 - So, the language will kind
of influence what you learn,
10:49 - how you learn it, how well you learn it.
10:52 - So, I think that's why
it's kind of important and
10:55 - even though this is more
of a fun video, I think
10:57 - it's important that you be
looking at these metrics,
11:00 - and be careful about which
direction you're heading in.
11:04 - Well, this is September 1st,
and it's 10am right now.
11:07 - So I just wanted to make this
video in the morning for you.
