00:00 - insecurity might be the biggest
00:03 - reason that's stopping you from becoming
00:07 - a better developer and making the money
00:10 - that you want to make and having the
00:11 - career that you want to
00:14 - have I have a funny crazy story to tell
00:18 - you but it's affecting but I can tell
00:20 - you this it's affecting a lot of
00:22 - different areas of your life and it
00:23 - depends on who you're around also
00:25 - depends on you as
00:27 - well um and so so it it really like
00:31 - makes a difference between everything
00:33 - like you being able to achieve your
00:34 - goals or not so a funny thing happened
00:37 - today uh one of my friends or one of the
00:40 - people that works on my team reached out
00:42 - to him and I said hey um somebody on my
00:45 - you
00:46 - know uh were like yo you're kind of
00:49 - getting
00:50 - fat and and I just reached out to him
00:53 - and told him directly said hey you're
00:56 - getting fat you have an environment
00:59 - that's making very comfortable and cozy
01:02 - and you are getting out of shape and I
01:04 - don't think that's something that you
01:05 - want and you've expressed that to me
01:07 - already and what's going to happen as a
01:09 - result of it if you keep going down this
01:11 - path okay and again the reason I'm
01:13 - telling you the story it's important and
01:14 - I will tell you why to you it actually
01:17 - involves you as a developer as well but
01:20 - let me just finish this right so I'm
01:22 - like
01:23 - why you're going down this path and bro
01:27 - it's not a good look on you
01:30 - when you have kids 10 years from now
01:33 - five years from now or whatever and you
01:34 - want to play with them and hang out with
01:36 - them and do all this stuff like you're
01:37 - not going to able to do a lot of those
01:38 - things because you're going to be
01:39 - huffing and panting and you're just
01:41 - going to be one of those dads that just
01:42 - sits there on the side and watches their
01:44 - kid play and it's kind of useless right
01:47 - can't play soccer with their kids can't
01:48 - do this can't do that you might want to
01:50 - but like it's hard for you because
01:52 - you're [ __ ] fat and like out of shape
01:54 - and you have no stamina
01:57 - left and you're going to regret this and
02:02 - so what I recommend is you go to the gym
02:05 - and like take care of yourself and
02:07 - here's the cool thing here's what
02:08 - happened he listens to this sends me a
02:12 - message and goes thank you so much kazy
02:14 - this was a much needed message I really
02:17 - appreciate you he's like I saved your
02:19 - audio and I'm going to listen to it
02:21 - every
02:22 - day and he said it's 11:00 p.m. right
02:25 - now and you know what I'm going to go to
02:27 - the gym right now and then he sent me a
02:28 - photo of him going into elevator and
02:30 - another photo of him at the gym actually
02:33 - working
02:34 - out and I was like this is amazing this
02:38 - is fascinating I just spoke to him and
02:40 - just gave him actual feedback and then 2
02:43 - minutes later he was actually already
02:45 - implementing it and improving his life
02:47 - and who's really going to benefit out of
02:49 - this like am I really going to get a
02:50 - huge benefit whether he follows the
02:52 - advice or not I'm really not nothing
02:54 - really changes in my life I will
02:56 - continue doing what I'm
02:57 - doing but he just took the advice and he
03:00 - got no ego involved in there and he's
03:04 - just is becoming a way better person and
03:06 - he's changing his life and like his
03:08 - girlfriend will thank him and his kids
03:10 - will thank him if he has kids eventually
03:12 - in the future and like he himself will
03:15 - thank himself because he just added like
03:16 - another 10 20 years to his life by
03:18 - making these decisions it's a domino
03:20 - effect if he goes today he he's more
03:23 - likely to go tomorrow if he goes
03:24 - tomorrow he's even more likely to go two
03:26 - days from now and I just told him like
03:28 - bro you have to start today because
03:30 - you're going to regret it as a day
03:32 - passes a week passes so like you cannot
03:34 - you just have to go [ __ ] today and so
03:37 - one it's being able to honestly tell
03:39 - people your opinion but two it's how
03:41 - people perceive it so and I'm going to
03:44 - give you another story as well which is
03:45 - the actual complete opposite but to make
03:48 - it relevant to you right now I'm just
03:49 - going to share with you it's like if you
03:51 - are getting feedback from somebody on
03:53 - how you can improve as a developer and
03:55 - you're not able to take that that's
03:57 - going to hinder your progress you're not
03:59 - not going to get to where you want to
04:01 - get to you're not going to learn the
04:02 - skills that you have to and developers
04:05 - are very insecure like one of the
04:07 - reasons why I believe a lot of the
04:08 - developers don't even look into chat GPT
04:10 - or Claude or use it heavily is because
04:13 - they're worried that they're going to
04:14 - get replaced so then if they just don't
04:17 - use it that's kind of their way of
04:18 - boycotting it
04:20 - and not falling victim to this
04:23 - inevitable AI that eventually will be
04:26 - the allseeing all knowing thing that
04:28 - like almost everybody will have to know
04:29 - how to use and it will do all of the
04:32 - coding underneath
04:36 - you and I'm going to expand more on this
04:38 - but let me tell you now the opposite
04:41 - story I was on a call with another
04:44 - friend and we were
04:46 - talking and I was like hey we should do
04:51 - XYZ and we should work on this project
04:55 - together and this friend was like pretty
04:57 - excited and so we jump into and you know
05:00 - start working on this project and once
05:03 - we started working on
05:05 - it um her and I she started to have like
05:09 - issues with how I was communicating it
05:10 - because I was really excited and I was
05:12 - telling her all these ideas she thought
05:14 - I was being demeaning to her and
05:15 - patronizing to her and not really caring
05:18 - about her opinions when in fact what was
05:20 - actually happening was I'm when I get
05:22 - excited I get excited like a child so
05:24 - start blurting out all my ideas but I am
05:26 - a very assertive very expressive very
05:28 - communicative person so to people who
05:30 - are nonassertive or slightly lower on
05:32 - the confidence scale they often get
05:34 - threatened by that and think that what's
05:36 - happening is I am attacking them and
05:38 - shutting them
05:39 - down
05:41 - um and if you have followed me or you
05:44 - know me from the channel like that's
05:45 - just how I speak and Nas who's my best
05:48 - friend and also my co-founder in in the
05:51 - business that we're building right
05:52 - now him and I are speaking like this to
05:55 - each other all the time like dude what
05:56 - if we run Facebook ads and we do this
05:58 - thing and then we get like five new
05:59 - customers and he's like yes and also if
06:02 - we do a YouTube thing on top of it or do
06:05 - Instagram ads that could add another
06:07 - three to four uh sales a day and then we
06:11 - just keep building on top of each
06:12 - other's
06:13 - ideas and so what happened was like her
06:17 - insecurity was kind of triggered with
06:19 - that and so then we started going deeper
06:21 - into it it's like hey what's going on
06:22 - like why are you feeling this when and
06:24 - she's like well you know like and then
06:27 - what was happening was how this
06:28 - insecurity was coming out she would just
06:29 - keep saying stuff very didactically
06:32 - without any level of curiosity and she
06:34 - be like well this thing that you're
06:36 - saying is just this right and I'm like
06:39 - yeah it it is she's like it's just this
06:41 - right and I'm like yeah it
06:45 - is um but we wouldn't get
06:49 - into like she wouldn't ask me actual
06:52 - questions like oh what are the things
06:54 - that we could do with these Facebook ads
06:55 - are there things could we do like could
06:58 - we do a 7-Day thing could we do a 10day
07:00 - thing what was happening was when I was
07:02 - sharing my ideas on these Facebook ads
07:04 - she was just really frustrated and upset
07:05 - because she's like well you're telling
07:08 - me something that I have already learned
07:10 - and so now when you're doing this you're
07:12 - patronizing me and condescending to me
07:15 - so I'm going to spend all this time on
07:17 - proving to you that I actually know but
07:20 - do it passive
07:22 - aggressively and it just got weird and
07:24 - we ended up wasting like 2 hours like
07:26 - talking about it or 3 hours and I and
07:29 - you know I'll be honest I was
07:30 - disregulated and I was triggered as well
07:32 - because I was frustrated and I was like
07:34 - why the [ __ ] do we have to go and have
07:36 - this like random battle and waste all
07:38 - this energy when like you could have
07:40 - just shared your ideas and I could have
07:41 - just shared mine and then we would be
07:42 - like 20 ideas later like talking about
07:45 - something absolutely incredible and like
07:46 - building something absolutely
07:48 - incredible and instead what has happened
07:50 - is like we just talked about something
07:53 - nonsensical and and whatnot and so it's
07:56 - like everybody has their own opinion but
07:57 - and I'll be honest I got disregulated
07:59 - and I got pretty angry and heated in
08:01 - that and I shouldn't have and I think I
08:02 - could have replied better and dealt with
08:03 - it better but my point is not that my
08:06 - point is this look at the two different
08:07 - scenarios on one side you talk to
08:10 - somebody and they just instantly
08:12 - Implement on the other side you talk to
08:14 - somebody they get defensive they get
08:16 - insecure and they just shut down and
08:19 - when they shut down here's the and let
08:21 - me tell you here's the interesting thing
08:23 - with the person that was motivated when
08:24 - I told him like to go work out and then
08:27 - he did well guess what now I want to
08:29 - take that advice even more because I'm
08:31 - like oh [ __ ] like now he's going working
08:32 - out so I got to go and work out so like
08:34 - not only did he improve his life and add
08:36 - massive value to his life but him taking
08:37 - action that fast I want to take action
08:39 - that fast and I want to go to the gym
08:41 - even more tomorrow and so like both of
08:43 - our Lives actually got massive value now
08:45 - think of the other situation where there
08:47 - was insecurity involved she got insecure
08:50 - and then she kind of shut down and then
08:53 - I kind of shut down and what happened as
08:56 - a result is like no progress was made on
08:59 - the those ideas and then next time I'm
09:01 - about to get into idea generation or
09:04 - brainstorming sessions with her I'm
09:06 - going to be much more hesitant much more
09:09 - like um what's it called like walking on
09:12 - eggshells right to actually share my
09:16 - thought and I think that in the
09:18 - development world when you're coding
09:20 - it's the same exact way which
09:23 - is you can have two people that you
09:26 - could teach coding to you could have one
09:28 - person where you just tell them exactly
09:31 - the feedback that they need to improve
09:33 - hey you need to actually write your code
09:36 - better you need to refactor your code
09:38 - better hey you should use Firebase
09:40 - instead of this other technology hey you
09:42 - should not leave uh your Firebase code
09:47 - and not do like unsubscribe and you
09:49 - should make sure you unsubscribe so you
09:50 - don't have like random memory
09:52 - leakage hey instead of doing all this
09:55 - class-based react components you should
09:58 - make it more functional
10:00 - and the list goes on and there's one
10:02 - person that just instantly does it and
10:04 - going twice the speed and then taking
10:06 - your ID and building on top of it and
10:07 - goes yes you're right I just learned
10:09 - about functional components and guess
10:11 - what there's actually even a newer way
10:13 - to do it and with next you can actually
10:14 - use server side actions and there's a
10:17 - and now these two guys are building and
10:19 - they're giving each other feedback and
10:21 - they're just like flying right like Ping
10:23 - ponging and flying and then you have the
10:25 - other guy where you tell him this and
10:27 - he's like well I already knew this
10:29 - I know this and you're like yeah you
10:32 - know this but you still [ __ ] suck
10:34 - like you still actually got the problem
10:36 - wrong you still wrote like class-based
10:38 - code so like knowledge doesn't mean
10:40 - anything like actually make it
10:42 - functional yeah yeah yeah functional
10:44 - functional I already no functional jsx
10:47 - uh react
10:48 - 18 you're like do you have Tourette's
10:50 - like what is going on like why are you
10:52 - just randomly blurting out these dactic
10:54 - things that you just know stuff but like
10:57 - who cares like it's not even about that
10:58 - it's like doesn't matter if you're right
11:00 - or wrong or you know more or I know less
11:02 - like let's just do the thing correctly
11:04 - like sure you know everything but let's
11:07 - let's just do this thing
11:10 - correctly and what happens is in the
11:12 - process is like one person is what like
11:17 - there's one pair that's winning and the
11:19 - other pair that's just stuck in taking
11:21 - each other down and all of it starts off
11:22 - with one [ __ ] being insecure um
11:26 - two is horrible but like starts off with
11:28 - one and it's like it could be you or the
11:31 - other person that could be insecure but
11:32 - it will lead to your downfall so look at
11:35 - your friends that you're learning coding
11:37 - around you're trying to become a better
11:38 - developer around if they're really
11:40 - insecure people you have to then be like
11:43 - I have to maybe around somebody who's
11:44 - not as insecure and has more confidence
11:46 - because you guys are going to ping pong
11:47 - each other to success
11:50 - two look at the reflection and look at
11:52 - yourself are you insecure are you having
11:54 - trouble taking feedback are you having
11:56 - trouble applying the AI stack and like
12:00 - actually coding with it becoming a
12:01 - better developer if somebody gives you a
12:04 - resource hey use this Library do you try
12:06 - to use that library or you just go no no
12:08 - no it's better to code with hands
12:10 - because you're actually getting insecure
12:11 - because there's something there's
12:12 - something somebody else knows that could
12:14 - be
12:15 - better I believe it's keeping a lot of
12:18 - people stuck and not allowing you to
12:20 - improve your level so I challenge you to
12:23 - look for one insecurity e either in
12:25 - somebody you're working with or in
12:27 - yourself and try to improve it and when
12:29 - you get feedback or
12:31 - criticism instead of spending time
12:33 - defending on your defending yourself if
12:35 - you think they are
12:38 - objectively I say it like this uh I made
12:41 - a rule with
12:43 - nas I said if you give me criticism or
12:47 - feedback on something that will improve
12:48 - my life I will never fight you it's a
12:51 - simple rule that's
12:52 - it um outside of that yeah I will get
12:55 - ugly and fight you like if you say some
12:57 - weird [ __ ] like he said something the
12:58 - other day which was like kind of pissed
13:01 - me off and I was like bro I was I'm
13:02 - offended by that like why would you
13:05 - think this and then we kind of talked
13:06 - about it right but if it's something
13:09 - like you know before uh if he's like
13:11 - dude you chewed with your mouth
13:14 - open don't do that I before I might
13:18 - fight him or he might fight me if I tell
13:19 - him that now we just go okay cool why
13:23 - because it's going to improve my life
13:24 - like I already know I can think one step
13:26 - ahead and go is that going to improve my
13:28 - life or hurt my life if I actually
13:29 - listen to him if it's going to improve
13:30 - my life I'm going to shut the [ __ ] up
13:32 - and I'm just going to do that
13:33 - thing only if it's not if I don't think
13:37 - genuinely it's going to improve my life
13:39 - then I will have a conversation about it
13:41 - but most things that's my rule so if
13:43 - somebody's talking to you and they're
13:44 - saying something and if you do it and
13:46 - improves your
13:47 - life try not to defend yourself just do
13:50 - that thing
13:51 - instead peace
