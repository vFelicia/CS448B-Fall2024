00:00 - wanted to share with you
00:02 - um the overall vision and
00:04 - there's a lot that i want to talk about
00:06 - and i just kind of want to have a
00:08 - unfiltered just open discussion with you
00:10 - guys
00:11 - because there's a lot been a lot on my
00:13 - mind
00:14 - and i thought instead of keeping it to
00:16 - myself i would rather share it with all
00:18 - of you
00:19 - and uh
00:21 - kind of just have an open conversation
00:23 - about this and i might get a lot of
00:24 - insight from you as well
00:27 - so
00:30 - there's a lot of plans for how we want
00:31 - to move forward with clever programmer
00:34 - moving forward this year and especially
00:36 - in 2022 because the year is coming to an
00:39 - end
00:40 - and
00:41 - one of the things that
00:43 - you know we were working on one of the
00:44 - things that we're essentially working on
00:46 - is this this entire year a lot of our
00:48 - time and energy was spent building out
00:51 - the new programs that we built and
00:53 - launched out like our coding boot camp
00:56 - and
00:57 - when i think about clever programmer and
00:58 - like why i started it what was the
01:00 - reason because there's so many ups and
01:01 - downs that happen in the journey that a
01:04 - lot of times you lose sight you know i'm
01:05 - not gonna lie there have been many times
01:07 - where i thought about why am i doing
01:08 - this like why
01:09 - why are we doing this at all like we
01:11 - should just not have it and i could have
01:13 - a very simple life and
01:15 - just have a regular job and don't have
01:17 - to deal with there's so many things that
01:20 - you have to deal with it's like you
01:21 - don't have to deal with them you can
01:22 - just do a regular job and be fine right
01:24 - so i thought about it and i'm like
01:26 - why
01:28 - and i went back to five years ago when
01:31 - it was just me there was nobody on the
01:32 - team
01:34 - uh we didn't have a massive team like we
01:35 - have like 10 or 15 people right now on
01:37 - the team and before we didn't have a
01:38 - team
01:39 - there wasn't anybody it was just me
01:42 - in my tiny little crappy office that i
01:44 - got in chicago it's like 400 square feet
01:47 - like super small
01:50 - and you know i would just
01:53 - i just loved coding
01:55 - you know that was one of my passions and
01:57 - that excited me
01:59 - and so i would code there and i'd just
02:01 - share that and i would code and i would
02:03 - share that and i would code and share
02:05 - that and that was it
02:06 - that was all that was happening right
02:08 - that was
02:10 - that was all that was happening
02:11 - and
02:13 - once i started sharing that information
02:15 - a lot of people started liking it
02:17 - getting value out of it and a lot of
02:19 - people were like hey this is awesome and
02:21 - so okay let me go more into that so then
02:23 - i started focusing more on the side of
02:25 - sharing it teaching it growing the
02:27 - channel
02:29 - and then one of the things that was the
02:30 - most transformative for me was when
02:32 - students started to be able to land jobs
02:35 - you know get a message like hey you know
02:37 - i've been struggling for so many years
02:39 - came across your content and
02:41 - i finally feel like i have the skills
02:42 - and i was able to land a job and
02:45 - that was something that was absolutely
02:47 - amazing the fact that students could get
02:49 - jobs the fact that i selfishly could do
02:52 - what i love which was coding and sharing
02:54 - yet those are the two things i
02:55 - absolutely love
02:59 - and
03:00 - that was it it was very very very simple
03:04 - you know it was just like the most
03:05 - simplest thing you can think of
03:07 - and that was really fun and that was a
03:10 - great way of doing things and i
03:13 - and a lot of people felt a lot of
03:14 - connection with me as well whereas over
03:17 - the years what started happening was we
03:18 - started getting a bigger team you have
03:20 - to manage the team you have to work with
03:21 - so many people
03:23 - and then we're launching these new
03:25 - programs they require a lot of
03:26 - fulfillment time energy and so like you
03:29 - start kind of seeing me less and less
03:31 - and less on youtube and then the
03:33 - connection with the people on youtube
03:35 - starts to be a little bit less and less
03:37 - which is you guys and
03:39 - that is kind of like
03:42 - you know like i kind of missed that part
03:45 - like i miss
03:47 - the feeling that i would get with
03:49 - connecting with all of you and
03:52 - constantly putting new things together
03:54 - for you and
03:55 - you know making an amazing you know
03:58 - whatever material that we dropped on
04:00 - youtube like that was awesome and i want
04:01 - to start getting back to more of that
04:05 - but one thing i don't want to give up
04:07 - that i'm addicted to and the team is
04:09 - addicted to is students getting jobs
04:12 - and students getting placed and working
04:15 - with companies and that is one of the
04:18 - best things ever
04:19 - and so up until now the problem that
04:21 - we've been having is
04:24 - we have great programs we provide
04:26 - incredible education and we want to get
04:29 - better at on the side you know where we
04:32 - have a weaknesses we want to get better
04:33 - on the side where we have more
04:34 - relationships with other companies
04:37 - where we can go hey here's our talent
04:40 - pool
04:42 - and
04:43 - there you go we just match make them
04:46 - because we're taking a student from you
04:48 - know hey you're a truck driver
04:51 - you are somebody who does like repair
04:53 - you were somebody who's doing help desk
04:55 - support we'll take you we'll teach you
04:57 - and we work with students three months
04:59 - six months seven months and we do
05:00 - hands-on training so much stuff right
05:02 - and we get them all the way there
05:05 - but the last step is them getting a job
05:07 - and so they will
05:09 - you know either will help them get a job
05:11 - or they will figure out how to get a job
05:12 - but just that one last step and i think
05:14 - that's one of the most impactful steps
05:16 - for us to not have
05:18 - in our company you know as like a main
05:21 - main main foundation for us to be
05:22 - extremely strong at that site because we
05:24 - have tons of students getting jobs
05:26 - but we wanted to be where we're so
05:28 - dialed in with these other companies
05:30 - that we could essentially just take our
05:32 - talent pool even you watching this on
05:34 - youtube
05:35 - can take you and give you opportunities
05:37 - to get jobs and give you opportunities
05:39 - to get interviews because we can go hey
05:40 - you're under clever programmer we've
05:42 - tested this person this person is
05:44 - qualified and let us put in touch with
05:46 - you
05:48 - and then businesses are like okay we
05:50 - trust clever programmer we trust who
05:52 - comes out of it cool like they go
05:53 - through you they go through the company
05:55 - clever programmer your chances shoot up
05:57 - like 10 or 20 x in terms of you being
06:00 - able to get a job
06:01 - and um
06:04 - i talked with somebody today
06:06 - who has a a pretty amazing
06:09 - you know company and i'll bring them
06:10 - i'll bring him on as a guest it's he's
06:12 - the ceo of van hack his name is ilya and
06:16 - when i was talking with him i got so
06:18 - much inspiration and i got so much
06:20 - insight into
06:22 - wow this is amazing like
06:25 - he's helped place 450
06:28 - student 50 people
06:31 - at
06:32 - a job like that's awesome
06:36 - but the main people that they provide
06:38 - for that he provides friends serves are
06:40 - the people who are like intermediate to
06:42 - advanced with five plus years of
06:44 - experience
06:46 - and he will like just get those people
06:48 - and then if you're good in your
06:49 - intermediate experience go to them and
06:52 - they will just hand you to a job right
06:55 - and i thought that was so fantastic that
06:57 - is such a life-changing thing to be able
07:00 - to do for somebody you know it's like
07:02 - it literally will change somebody's life
07:04 - like he showed us a photo of one of his
07:07 - students who's on a flight like who
07:09 - moved from pakistan
07:11 - and moved to canada because of the job
07:14 - and you could see the photo photos of
07:16 - him being on the plane and i'm like
07:18 - damn that is cool and then there's so
07:20 - many stories like that but there's 450
07:23 - students placed at a job that is crazy
07:27 - like
07:28 - it's so crazy that if you actually think
07:29 - about it i'm just gonna do math here
07:31 - that's why i'm looking
07:32 - over at this screen so take like
07:35 - okay so think about it like this
07:37 - 450 students let's say an average
07:39 - student that's placed makes 80 to 90 000
07:42 - a year right 450 multiplied by an
07:46 - average 90 000 a year
07:48 - that's
07:49 - those 450 people combined are making
07:52 - four are all together making 40 million
07:56 - 500 000
07:57 - per year
07:59 - 40 million dollars per year so like
08:02 - he was able to do something that helped
08:04 - provide 40 million dollars a year worth
08:07 - of value
08:09 - to the people who
08:11 - you know um
08:14 - i don't know that seems pretty amazing
08:16 - like that changed
08:17 - that changes all those people's lives
08:19 - forever
08:20 - and it provides so much value to the job
08:22 - marketplace
08:24 - and i kept thinking about it and i'm
08:26 - kind of getting obsessed with that idea
08:27 - because like i hate that we can give you
08:30 - these skills on youtube but then we
08:32 - can't go here let us also plug you into
08:35 - a company
08:36 - like that's been kind of eating away at
08:38 - me and you know most youtubers that i
08:40 - look at they're not doing that because
08:42 - it's a hard thing to do right like
08:44 - we installed a coding bootcamp into our
08:46 - business this year and that was a
08:48 - freaking hard thing to be able to pull
08:50 - off like
08:51 - that took massive amount of money
08:54 - massive amount of effort
08:56 - massive amount of energy from the whole
08:58 - team
08:59 - because we have to like compete with
09:01 - massive coding boot camps that have like
09:04 - millions and millions and millions tens
09:06 - of millions or hundreds of millions of
09:08 - dollars of funding
09:11 - and now we as a small company have to
09:13 - have to compete against that but we
09:14 - still pulled it off and we still
09:16 - provided so much value and we have so
09:18 - many students and we have our average
09:20 - placement job rate for most students is
09:23 - 55 000 a year or more as a junior
09:25 - developer right so this 90 000 a year
09:28 - that i'm talking talking about it's for
09:29 - five plus years of experience our
09:32 - students have you know oftentimes no
09:35 - experience of coding so we'll take
09:37 - somebody who's help desk or it's truck
09:39 - driver or it doesn't matter right like
09:41 - has done e-commerce in the past and has
09:43 - no idea about coding but we'll teach so
09:46 - when i think about them like
09:49 - that is
09:50 - like that is really cool and that's
09:52 - fascinating and like that was really
09:54 - hard to figure out right and to do
09:57 - and we've we provide so much education
09:59 - also just on our youtube channel for
10:01 - free and all our platforms because when
10:04 - i think about like what's the number one
10:06 - let me unblur myself
10:09 - when i think about what's the number one
10:10 - goal that i could serve
10:12 - and the entire company could serve and
10:14 - if i could just take all the emotion out
10:16 - of it it's not like me giving you crazy
10:18 - energy
10:19 - or us hyping you up or us
10:22 - it's none of that it's
10:23 - you going from where you are and you
10:26 - getting a job as a developer
10:28 - everything else is honestly a bonus
10:32 - so when i think about that i go
10:35 - huh
10:36 - that's the direction we want to go to
10:38 - where we can like
10:40 - get students jobs
10:43 - and
10:44 - that's it right because then how our
10:46 - business how our business model works at
10:48 - that point is it's
10:51 - the company pays us
10:54 - and we get you placed at a job and so
10:56 - it's just a very simple
10:59 - thing and
11:01 - i just feel like
11:03 - it's the right way to go long term you
11:05 - know right now as a company we need
11:07 - funding and we need support so we'll do
11:09 - a lot of things you know we'll be like
11:11 - we'll offer a ton of valuable things but
11:12 - i feel like ultimately the goal is
11:15 - how can we remove all the friction for
11:17 - you so that you can we can just give you
11:19 - all the skills
11:20 - as frictionless as possible
11:23 - and as affordably as possible
11:25 - so then you can get a job
11:28 - so
11:30 - that's the side that we're trying we're
11:32 - in the process of figuring out that's
11:34 - the side that we're weak at that's a
11:36 - side we're trying to get a lot a lot
11:39 - stronger at
11:40 - you know and this that side specifically
11:42 - is relationships with other
11:44 - big companies startups so that you could
11:47 - essentially just get placed at those
11:49 - jobs
11:50 - of course
11:51 - you know assuming you've followed our
11:53 - channel you've built the skill but
11:54 - regardless of what country you live in
11:56 - right because we know a lot of people in
11:58 - third world country if you're watching
11:59 - this video right now
12:01 - it's hard for you to be able to join any
12:03 - of our courses because like it's much
12:05 - more expensive where you live you know
12:07 - and so
12:09 - um and it's like we want to provide that
12:10 - value that coaching but it's also really
12:12 - hard to be able to do it for free at
12:15 - scale the best we can do is like provide
12:16 - it on youtube
12:18 - but what this does for us is we can now
12:21 - even help people in in any country right
12:23 - like nigeria india pakistan
12:27 - it doesn't matter like all the countries
12:29 - are now open because the u.s market is
12:31 - looking for talent and there are not
12:33 - enough jobs to fill
12:34 - there's a huge gap in the supply and
12:37 - demand there's a massive supply and the
12:39 - demand is very short there's like one
12:41 - million developer job postings per year
12:43 - i think in u.s that don't get filled or
12:46 - is it either it's worldwide or u.s
12:48 - that's a huge amount of job openings
12:50 - that don't get filled
12:53 - right and so
12:56 - um
12:57 - so we want to be able to help fill that
12:59 - and we want to be able to help people in
13:01 - all countries not just us anywhere in
13:03 - the world and you know you can get us
13:06 - paying rates even from third world
13:08 - countries
13:09 - and even if it's slightly less than an
13:11 - average like u.s citizen might get paid
13:13 - like that's still huge right if you're
13:15 - in pakistan which is where i'm from
13:18 - um if you get paid like literally 10 000
13:22 - a year you're balling like usd you know
13:25 - if you're getting paid 40 000 or 55 000
13:29 - i mean that's huge right that's like
13:31 - generation changing and so
13:35 - we want to get into that but what we
13:37 - need for that is that's going to take
13:40 - time it's going to take a lot of effort
13:41 - and we're really like this area i'm not
13:43 - we're not very knowledgeable in and we
13:45 - don't have many relations with a lot of
13:47 - big companies and
13:48 - we want to get better at it so this is a
13:50 - part in the title where it says i could
13:51 - use your help this is a part where i
13:54 - want to ask for your help because
13:55 - ultimately our goal is
13:58 - maximum number of students placed at a
14:00 - job per year and we want to like make
14:02 - that our number one goal you know so we
14:05 - want to want to get to
14:07 - our ultimate goal is
14:09 - as much education as we can possibly
14:12 - provide for free
14:13 - and as many students we can get place
14:16 - at jobs that would
14:18 - that would literally make us the perfect
14:20 - market fit right because
14:22 - we take away
14:24 - all the friction from you and we take
14:26 - the friction away from other businesses
14:27 - in the marketplace and we match make and
14:30 - we get you the skills you need as well
14:32 - and i just feel like
14:34 - from my heart wise that feels great to
14:37 - move in that direction from the
14:38 - business-wise it feels great to move in
14:40 - that direction
14:42 - um from your perspective it feels best
14:45 - to move in that direction i think it
14:47 - would bring massive value to all of you
14:50 - and to you watching
14:52 - so this is the part where i need your
14:53 - help which is
14:58 - for i mean yeah i mean it's random
15:00 - somebody making up stuff because i don't
15:02 - even know where it's like what you don't
15:04 - you don't know what you don't know right
15:05 - so it's like
15:07 - i guess like drop a message if
15:10 - you are
15:11 - in
15:12 - you know at a job at a startup or your
15:15 - companies are looking for developers you
15:17 - know i guess like that would be the
15:18 - first place like is your company looking
15:20 - for a developer are you currently
15:22 - employed your company is looking for a
15:23 - developer if they are
15:25 - uh you know
15:27 - you know just drop a comment below
15:30 - or if you really really
15:32 - uh
15:33 - are adamant about helping i think the
15:35 - best one that i will guarantee to see i
15:37 - will see your comments as well for sure
15:39 - i'll see your comments but you can text
15:41 - me at this number
15:43 - it will be
15:45 - one two two four six five one eight
15:48 - eight one seven again that's one two two
15:50 - four six five one eight eight one seven
15:53 - you could text me at that number and you

15:56 - you know
15:58 - job help or something and i will know
16:00 - what that means and i will get in touch
16:01 - with you immediately so i basically need
16:03 - help from anybody that's if you're
16:05 - working at a company or you have a
16:07 - company that's looking for developer
16:08 - jobs
16:10 - because i think that'd be the best place
16:11 - to kind of get started that would be the
16:13 - best place to start a
16:15 - you know you know communication process
16:17 - there
16:18 - and
16:19 - go hey we have talent we could
16:21 - hook you up with talent right so
16:24 - maybe you're already working at a
16:25 - company you know if it's between 10 to
16:27 - 50 people that's a great size if it's
16:30 - bigger then that's even better
16:31 - especially if you're looking for
16:32 - developers because we have tons of
16:34 - people on youtube we have tons of people
16:37 - in our boot camps and our courses that
16:39 - are ready to get jobs or they're super
16:42 - close to getting jobs and we want to
16:44 - just increase that process and make it
16:46 - faster
16:48 - so
16:49 - you know those things would be really
16:51 - helpful if you want to message anything
16:52 - around that because then i'll follow up
16:54 - with you in more detail because that
16:55 - would be game changer
16:58 - um
16:59 - any additional way you want to help that
17:01 - would be
17:02 - absolutely huge like i don't know if
17:03 - you're really good at reaching out to
17:05 - companies or talking to companies or you
17:06 - have experience with b2b whatever the
17:09 - case may be you can let me know that
17:10 - i'll follow up with you i'll speak with
17:12 - you
17:12 - that could be a huge freaking game
17:14 - changer because our goal collectively is
17:17 - to get max number of job placements
17:20 - you know and i feel like
17:22 - content is a great way to do it
17:26 - but
17:26 - it like
17:28 - it gives you all the education but then
17:30 - the last part of actually landing a job
17:32 - it just leaves it in the air
17:34 - and i felt i feel like if we control
17:36 - that part a clever programmer
17:39 - and we could fight on your behalf for a
17:41 - higher paying salary and
17:44 - getting you all the benefits and all of
17:45 - that and that was our in our control
17:48 - we could get people higher paying jobs
17:52 - we could control how many students could
17:55 - get jobs and whatever our number ever is
17:57 - like if we get let's just say 200 people
17:59 - placed at a job or 300 verified people
18:02 - placed at a job a year if we could
18:03 - actually control that process and we
18:05 - have a relationship with these companies
18:06 - we could easily 10x that number and get
18:09 - a thousand or like 2 000 people place
18:12 - the jobs per year which would be
18:14 - freaking
18:16 - massive right like
18:18 - oh my god at 55 000 let's just say as a
18:20 - junior developer
18:22 - a thousand people placed oh my god that
18:25 - would be like
18:27 - if thousand people got placed oh no i
18:29 - wrote 10 000 people let me write that so
18:31 - if a thousand people got placed at jobs
18:34 - making 55 000 a year that would
18:36 - essentially mean that
18:37 - we're helping
18:39 - the economy move forward by 55 million
18:42 - dollars a year that would be that's
18:44 - crazy like between a thousand developers
18:46 - making that much that is
18:48 - absolutely incredible
18:50 - so that's an exciting goal i think i
18:52 - want to shoot for
18:54 - you know
18:54 - whatever like i'm gonna have my hopes
18:57 - high my expectations low and that's
18:59 - where the margin of happiness exists by
19:01 - the way
19:02 - so
19:03 - i i would literally like love
19:05 - to have you know between a hundred to a
19:07 - thousand people place the jobs in 2022
19:11 - verifiable
19:12 - documented with their like numbers right
19:15 - there or whatever they're comfortable
