00:00 - my mac setup for coding and the setup
00:02 - that i actually recommend for you going
00:04 - into 2021
00:05 - smash that like button so this video
00:07 - goes out to more developers so
00:09 - they can also build an amazing career
00:11 - because this channel is
00:12 - all about helping you grow as a
00:15 - full-time or a freelance developer
00:17 - and breaking past that six-figure mark
00:20 - now
00:20 - there are a lot of tools that you're
00:22 - gonna learn about and there are a lot of
00:23 - new
00:24 - maybe things and workflows that you're
00:26 - gonna learn about that you might not
00:27 - have
00:28 - it's gonna take some time but pick them
00:29 - up they're gonna bring you so much value
00:31 - and increase your productivity as a
00:32 - developer it'll also allow you to
00:34 - build projects faster therefore have a
00:36 - better portfolio or
00:38 - perform higher at your job which allows
00:40 - you to actually make more
00:42 - income or if you're a freelancer make
00:44 - twice a amount of projects and make
00:45 - twice a amount of money
00:46 - let's jump right into it what's up guys
00:49 - this is quasi from cleverprogrammer.com
00:51 - i'm going to talk to you about how my
00:52 - mac
00:53 - is set up for coding i saw this cool
00:56 - article
00:57 - on daily.dev which is a great resource
00:59 - for you to go to and click their blog
01:01 - and it just gives you
01:02 - hot things that are happening and it
01:04 - made me think man my
01:05 - mac setup is pretty cool a lot of people
01:07 - ask me how do i have what i have
01:09 - and how do i use it so i'm gonna talk
01:11 - about it in this video i'm gonna just
01:12 - start riffing off pick up whatever you
01:14 - can i think it's gonna be really helpful
01:16 - so one of the things is for my command
01:18 - line i use zsh
01:20 - i highly highly highly recommend that
01:22 - you use this too
01:24 - for pretty much any language you're
01:25 - coding in csh gives you a really amazing
01:28 - environment
01:29 - to use it also get homebrew it allows
01:32 - you to install
01:33 - things very easily i think it will also
01:35 - be the thing that allows you to install
01:37 - csh
01:38 - homebrew for any of my web development i
01:40 - use
01:41 - chrome because it allows me to use the
01:43 - chrome inspector tool
01:44 - so i hope that you're using chrome as a
01:47 - developer
01:48 - and that's what i use for doing most of
01:50 - my web development
01:51 - highly recommend it because it has a
01:53 - great debugger built in
01:55 - it allows you to use the console and
01:56 - check what's going on
01:58 - and you know if you want to see how
02:01 - something looks
02:02 - in different mobile devices you can
02:03 - check that too so use chrome
02:05 - other things i use for my mac setup is i
02:08 - use
02:09 - alfred instead of spotlight alfred is
02:11 - just way better
02:12 - way faster learn how to use alfred i
02:15 - know we had a team member jacob on our
02:16 - team
02:17 - a clever programmer and he didn't know
02:19 - about alfred kept fighting with me he
02:21 - was like no this was not good he had
02:22 - this german accent we love this guy and
02:24 - then finally
02:25 - he gave up and he used alfred and he's
02:28 - like
02:29 - i am never going back alfred is the best
02:31 - and i was like
02:32 - i told you jacob i freaking told you so
02:34 - use
02:35 - alfred way faster than spotlight it will
02:37 - find your files really fast it's really
02:39 - helpful for programming as well
02:41 - for your terminal don't use the regular
02:43 - terminal i recommend
02:44 - use item 2. it comes in with a lot of
02:48 - smart things like auto suggestions it
02:50 - comes with the ability to
02:51 - search and find things built into it and
02:53 - a ton of other things which i can't even
02:55 - remember the top of my head
02:56 - but just use item 2 i just know that
02:59 - you're going to be a very happy
03:01 - developer
03:02 - i use git which obviously pretty much
03:04 - every developer uses
03:06 - and i have a workflow with git where i
03:08 - have a ssh built in
03:10 - which then allows me to essentially do
03:12 - my git
03:13 - commits without having to always ask for
03:15 - my email or password so it creates this
03:17 - nice workflow
03:18 - where i can do my git add git commit get
03:21 - push
03:21 - to origin master where i'm doing
03:23 - wherever i'm doing it without it needing
03:25 - me to
03:26 - constantly give it my password so learn
03:28 - how to use the ssh
03:30 - and learn how to make those keys and put
03:32 - them into your git
03:33 - and have that solid workflow for my ides
03:36 - when it comes to python a lot of the
03:38 - times i will go to pycharm
03:40 - and it's my main tool and weapon of
03:43 - choice and i just love it and i love how
03:45 - intelligent it
03:46 - is and whenever i can use pycharm i will
03:48 - always use pycharm
03:50 - my second option which is you know now
03:53 - becoming one of my favorite options also
03:56 - is
03:56 - visual studio code as my ide it's really
03:59 - really good
04:00 - i want to tell you what my work
04:01 - environment is
04:03 - so when i'm using visual studio code i
04:05 - like to use
04:06 - vim you know you can actually use it as
04:08 - an extension but
04:10 - vim is this whole other world that if
04:12 - you don't know about you're gonna fall
04:13 - into a rabbit hole
04:14 - it's the most beautiful thing on the
04:15 - planet most developers i try to convince
04:18 - nas half the time like hey learn them
04:19 - like yeah that's not gonna happen
04:21 - you know but that's whatever that's just
04:23 - nas i recommend
04:25 - and you you learn how to use vim it's
04:27 - freaking awesome
04:28 - if you don't get anything else out of it
04:30 - it's just an amazing rabbit hole to fall
04:32 - down into and it's just like
04:34 - what this is possible what is this world
04:37 - and why did nobody ever tell me about
04:40 - this it's just
04:40 - you just have these crazy brain
04:42 - explosion after brain explosion
04:44 - initially what will happen is your
04:45 - productivity will go down
04:47 - and you will feel that like that you are
04:50 - the worst developer on the planet
04:51 - you will become much worse much slower
04:53 - much more confused for about
04:55 - three weeks and on the fourth week you
04:57 - will
04:58 - get as good as you previously were so
05:00 - you'd be like that's not that cool
05:01 - but then week five six seven and eight
05:03 - two months three months in
05:05 - you're just gonna smoke your past self
05:07 - and then it's kind of beautiful the type
05:08 - of wizardry you can do
05:10 - and you truly just become a hacker and
05:12 - it's one of those people you know that
05:13 - we watch those hollywood movies and we
05:16 - go
05:16 - we want to be like that hacker guy you
05:18 - will become that hacker guy
05:20 - learn vim it actually helps speed up
05:22 - your productivity and development and
05:24 - all of that
05:25 - tons of other things i use on my visual
05:27 - studio code are
05:28 - prettier of course which is you know
05:30 - just making sure that
05:31 - when i'm saving stuff it just formats it
05:33 - really easily
05:34 - get lens to be able to do my git commits
05:37 - in just a much easier way it kind of
05:39 - this is super
05:40 - charges your code and your uh git
05:43 - environment which it does i recommend
05:45 - you use that plug-in
05:46 - bracket pair colorizer is another one
05:49 - that is very very helpful but just make
05:50 - sure your brackets are matching
05:52 - all the time live share is a extension i
05:54 - use
05:55 - with visual studio code to make sure
05:57 - that when i'm
05:58 - working with another developer we can
05:59 - work in the same environment and this is
06:01 - where i feel that visual studio code
06:03 - really takes the cake and this is one
06:04 - thing that's really awesome about
06:06 - them you can even share your local host
06:09 - terminal
06:09 - you can even share your actual local
06:12 - host
06:13 - that other developers working with you
06:14 - can actually see the app you're building
06:16 - you
06:17 - can see the errors in the command line
06:19 - can get full read and write
06:20 - functionality to your command line when
06:22 - you guys are writing code together
06:24 - there's zero lag and you can see each
06:25 - other's names and you guys are building
06:27 - it
06:27 - it's so freaking cool i love it live
06:30 - share extension on
06:31 - visual studio code and then other tools
06:33 - that i think that every day
06:35 - everybody in the modern world should
06:37 - just have are for example for
06:39 - communication
06:40 - slack is the best for developers you can
06:42 - write code in it you can write
06:44 - syntactically highlighted code in it
06:46 - which is just beautiful zoom to
06:49 - communicate with anybody online
06:50 - learn zoom annotations because it allows
06:53 - you to
06:53 - communicate your ideas really well so as
06:55 - a developer you could
06:57 - go into zoom and just circle you know a
06:59 - block of code or a function and just go
07:01 - this is the piece of code that i'm
07:02 - talking about
07:03 - and this piece of code does this other
07:05 - thing that i'm talking about
07:07 - that's really nice use the visual
07:10 - things because especially when you're
07:12 - explaining something to somebody who's
07:13 - not a developer
07:15 - who's a product manager or somebody else
07:18 - you want to be able to communicate your
07:20 - ideas with as less words and as many
07:22 - visuals as possible because it makes it
07:25 - so simple it takes all these complex
07:27 - ideas and turns them into something that
07:29 - is so
07:30 - extremely easy to understand other
07:32 - things i use with my mac setup
07:33 - is dropler incredibly easy for
07:36 - screenshots especially as a developer
07:38 - you want to screenshot highlight a
07:39 - certain portion of code
07:41 - hit the save url it immediately goes
07:43 - bloop
07:44 - and adds you know opens up a new tab
07:47 - it's already the image is uploaded
07:49 - online you can take that url and send it
07:51 - to somebody else
07:52 - if you want to record your screen and
07:54 - talk about it you could do it
07:55 - with dropler as well though for actually
07:57 - screen recording explaining your code
08:00 - and explaining what problems you have
08:02 - for example maybe you have
08:03 - you're a student who is stuck on a
08:06 - problem you're trying to explain
08:07 - what's wrong with you're trying to ask
08:09 - for help the best way is
08:10 - make a short video there's a service
08:13 - called loom
08:14 - you hit one button it just starts
08:16 - recording you and your screen
08:18 - so you can actually just highlight the
08:20 - part of code you're stuck on
08:21 - what your problem is and now whether
08:23 - you're a student or a professional
08:24 - software developer working at a company
08:26 - and as soon as you hit stop
08:28 - loom automatically uploads this video
08:29 - online in like five seconds
08:31 - you can take that url and send it to
08:33 - your co-worker or send it to your
08:35 - teacher
08:35 - or send it to your friend they will
08:37 - explain to you exactly
08:40 - when to see this video it's so easy for
08:42 - them to understand what your actual
08:43 - problem was
08:44 - they can then help you and then you know
08:46 - give you the right answer or help you
08:48 - move past your problem
08:50 - loom is extremely effective or if you're
08:52 - employed and you want to explain a
08:54 - concept
08:55 - using visuals and using a video
08:57 - extremely extremely important
08:59 - so use that tool the other things that i
09:02 - like to just recommend especially if
09:04 - you're using a mac is learn what virtual
09:06 - desktops are
09:07 - make sure that you have more than one
09:09 - virtual desktop opened up
09:10 - at any given time so you can have
09:12 - cleaner environments and move around
09:14 - faster i have a tool called spectacle
09:16 - which allows me to do
09:17 - window management so if i'm trying to
09:19 - open up a terminal and put it on one
09:21 - side or i'm trying to open up another
09:22 - thing put it on the other side
09:23 - spectacle is a great tool that allows me
09:26 - to do window management you can also use
09:28 - a app called magnet other than that i'm
09:31 - gonna keep going forever so i'm just
09:32 - gonna stop i hope that this video was
09:34 - valuable for you if it was make sure
