00:00 - hey you what is up it's been a minute
00:05 - since you and I sat down and talked I
00:08 - miss you it's been a while but I'm ready
00:11 - to start jumping back on the horse of
00:13 - speaking with you and connecting with
00:14 - you and this video has something very
00:16 - special for you that I want to talk
00:18 - about it's a concept that's very
00:20 - important for you to understand because
00:21 - it's so actionable and so tangible
00:24 - that's why it's important for you to
00:26 - hear it I've been talking about it with
00:28 - my friend for a while we have like
00:30 - really deep conversations on this I
00:32 - thought that I might share this with you
00:34 - so you can get this benefit as well what
00:37 - I want to talk about is like
00:38 - understanding motivation and behavioral
00:41 - change at a deeper level and peeling
00:44 - back a lot of the layers that are over
00:47 - on top of it okay so you can understand
00:49 - how it works at a subconscious level and
00:51 - you could not only understand but
00:53 - because you get that deep nuanced
00:55 - intelligence of how it works you could
00:56 - actually change a lot of your patterns
00:59 - and a lot of your behavior so whether
01:01 - you want to start and grow a business to
01:03 - six figures or you want to become
01:06 - amazing at coding and becoming just a
01:08 - badass developer or land your dream
01:10 - coding job or it's you want to get a
01:14 - better girlfriend or have just an
01:16 - amazing relationship whatever your goal
01:18 - is understanding these concepts that I'm
01:20 - gonna share in this video will help you
01:23 - get to that with that said let's jump
01:27 - right into it
01:29 - [Music]
01:38 - [Applause]
01:40 - okay
01:41 - so let's first understand like different
01:44 - levels of motivation and what is
01:46 - required for you to like actually cause
01:48 - a change okay so I just sitting with my
01:50 - friend today and one thing I've noticed
01:52 - about him is that pretty much his whole
01:55 - life he's been he's pretty consistent
01:59 - it's something that
02:04 - we just saved that amazing lady behind
02:08 - me so one thing I've noticed about my
02:11 - friend is that he's been very consistent
02:12 - with whatever that he puts his mind to
02:16 - so it's kind of like think of what it
02:18 - requires for you to change your behavior
02:20 - or change your pattern or something
02:22 - right so let's say you want to become
02:24 - better at coding for you to do that you
02:28 - need to code pretty much every day you
02:31 - need to find the motivation to code more
02:33 - you need to watch videos on coding you
02:36 - need to listen to coding programs and
02:38 - read coding books okay surround yourself
02:42 - with people who code surround yourself
02:44 - with people who are great developers
02:45 - alongside your ahead of you and start
02:49 - immersing yourself but for that big
02:51 - shift to happen there needs to be
02:53 - something that in your mind needs to
02:55 - change so then that physical emotional
02:58 - and mental change can actually take
03:01 - place so a lot of things for need for
03:03 - you to change okay now there are
03:05 - different kinds of personality types and
03:07 - if you understand what kind you are and
03:10 - what level of motivation or push you
03:12 - need to get going
03:15 - it can help I it can help you in many
03:18 - aspects in life meaning that you'll know
03:21 - exactly how much you need to learn like
03:24 - what kind of books you need to read to
03:26 - advance in your career what kind of
03:28 - friends you need to be surrounded by and
03:29 - exactly what you need to do okay so I'll
03:31 - give you an example my friend was very
03:33 - consistent in a lot of the things that
03:35 - he does he doesn't need a lot of
03:37 - motivation okay so I've been realizing
03:39 - that he's been going to the gym and he's
03:40 - been getting going assault gym so much
03:42 - they actually got me back on track to
03:45 - going and lifting I needed a lot of push
03:48 - I need a lot of motivation to actually
03:50 - make that change okay so if you think of
03:52 - it like a meter it's like a meter has to
03:55 - be filled up and once that meter is
03:57 - filled up it spills over and then you
04:00 - actually make that shift and actually
04:02 - start taking action on it okay and
04:04 - actually start changing it
04:05 - so for me it's like I had to read 10 X
04:08 - book by Grant Cardone I needed to read
04:11 - be obsessed or be averaged by Grant
04:12 - Cardone kind of get a kick in the ass
04:13 - from there I needed a listen to more
04:16 - Gary V's instagrams you know I'd like
04:18 - kind of follow him on there
04:19 - I needed my friends to talk to me I
04:21 - needed to like look at my son be like
04:23 - you pieces like go to the gym like put
04:27 - in that work lift that weight you know
04:30 - do what others won't so you can look
04:31 - like others don't I'm just a lot of
04:34 - brainwashing right to actually cause a
04:36 - change but for my friend he just had to
04:39 - think about it a few times he's like oh
04:42 - under the gym okay cool
04:46 - the next day he just woke up and he just
04:48 - started going to the gym and he just
04:51 - started lifting and he would just go
04:53 - four to five times a week and he would
04:55 - just do a day in and day out and he was
04:57 - quiet he didn't need to scream it out to
05:00 - anybody
05:00 - he wasn't loud about it he just did it
05:05 - and he was consistent and he did not
05:08 - miss a single day and you look at him
05:12 - two months from now and he looks like
05:15 - garbage no offense you know look at him
05:19 - he's actually helping me record this
05:20 - video right now and you look at him now
05:24 - and this dude looks so much better okay
05:28 - stronger more muscular a lot more
05:32 - hypertrophy action going on
05:34 - okay bodybuilding and a lot stronger
05:37 - more sharper active more engaged more
05:41 - present and a lot of it came from just
05:44 - making sure that he exercised on a
05:46 - regular basis and lifted on a regular
05:48 - basis and so interesting interesting
05:51 - the contrast between him and myself okay
05:55 - it's very interesting because he needed
05:59 - a very little bit of motivation to get
06:00 - going so if we have to look at the meter
06:02 - that's required for him to get going
06:04 - it's very small and once that meter
06:06 - filled up that was it and it didn't even
06:09 - need to be filled up over and over and
06:12 - over again for me on the other hand the
06:16 - meter needed to be filled
06:17 - I needed to get just really worked up
06:19 - and engaged and just like looking myself
06:21 - in the mirror talking to myself talking
06:22 - my friends were kicking my ass reading
06:24 - books that are kicking my ass to
06:26 - eventually just get my ass in the gym
06:28 - and then even when I went every day I
06:31 - would go and enjoy the process and loved
06:33 - it but every day actually still need to
06:35 - watch videos on lifting or listen to
06:38 - something about training or lifting to
06:41 - actually keep having that motivation and
06:43 - not lose it so I need to keep it keep
06:46 - feeding that beast resting on my friend
06:48 - he actually doesn't need to feed that
06:50 - beast he can still put in that work and
06:53 - he can still get those things done okay
06:55 - once he initially decides that he wants
06:58 - to do it he can just keep it going and
06:59 - then he doesn't need to feed it you know
07:01 - maybe you're either my personality type
07:03 - or maybe you're my friends personality
07:05 - type and the reason why that's important
07:07 - to understand is because then you can
07:08 - understand how to actually live your
07:09 - life and what you need to do so I'll
07:11 - give you another example from this now
07:13 - that he knows that he's kind of like
07:15 - them he's like a Tesla okay and
07:17 - initially I called him a Nissan Versa
07:19 - which he didn't like but he's more like
07:22 - a Tesla of willpower and motivation
07:25 - because he doesn't need much of it he
07:27 - needs a very little bit and once he gets
07:29 - it he doesn't need to refuel himself for
07:33 - an extended period of time
07:34 - so what does that mean that means that
07:36 - if he can focus on the right direction
07:39 - he can just continue going on that path
07:42 - for a long period of time without
07:45 - needing to come back or recheck or
07:48 - whatever you can just keep going back a
07:49 - cone going on it so as he's going on
07:51 - that in that time you can actually start
07:53 - working on a new habit and develop a new
07:55 - amazing habit or something new okay so
07:58 - for example one of them can be lifting
08:00 - another one could actually be like
08:01 - addicting himself to books and then he
08:03 - can just read new books and learn about
08:06 - new topics right so maybe he can learn
08:07 - about financial independence and stocks
08:10 - or investing and you can just every
08:13 - single day he'll just keep learning it
08:15 - for over two years
08:17 - and it'll be better than all of us
08:19 - because he just put in that consistent
08:21 - effort that is a pro right that's
08:23 - certainly a pro he needs less motivation
08:25 - and you can just keep going and so
08:26 - instead of having to Reese penned that
08:28 - time coming back to that and refueling
08:30 - his motivation
08:30 - he can in that time pick up a new skill
08:32 - instead okay whereas I'm reworking
08:35 - myself but it can also be dangerous and
08:39 - this is one important thing I want you
08:40 - to know so that if this personality if
08:44 - my friends personality type of resonates
08:45 - with you you can avoid this danger okay
08:48 - and here's the danger here's kind of the
08:50 - con of his personality because it takes
08:53 - so little for him to get on a path and
08:55 - get going it's amazing if you get put
08:58 - himself into an amazing situation right
09:00 - or developing amazing habit and just
09:02 - keep working on it for a long period of
09:03 - time but on the flip side it's just as
09:06 - easy for him to do a less challenging
09:09 - task and be okay with it
09:11 - and less life-changing tasks and be okay
09:15 - with it okay and he can actually be he
09:19 - can actually get addicted to mediocrity
09:20 - and being average and be okay with it
09:23 - and expend a lot of his life actually on
09:26 - it okay so you know for example he's
09:28 - worked at different jobs that were below
09:30 - his skill level and the amount of
09:33 - challenge he could take in and he was
09:36 - just okay with working at those jobs for
09:38 - one to two years and for me it was kind
09:41 - of like I just told him I don't like
09:43 - dude those jobs it's not like they're
09:45 - below you but you can do a lot more
09:47 - mentally challenging things physically
09:49 - challenged things that would make you a
09:51 - lot harder to replace you have a lot
09:53 - more potential so what are you doing
09:55 - doing that stuff and so you have to be
09:57 - like shaking out of it and it took a
09:58 - long period of time to shake him out of
10:00 - it right or for himself to actually
10:02 - shake himself out of it because it's
10:04 - very easy for him to just be okay with
10:06 - that thing for a very long period of
10:08 - time whereas for myself my same thing
10:11 - that is up is kind of a con for me and a
10:14 - bad thing I need a lot of motivation
10:15 - it's also a good thing as well because
10:17 - I'm constantly checking myself right so
10:21 - if I'm doing something that's less
10:22 - demanding for me since I'm constantly
10:24 - checking myself and I'm constantly like
10:27 - say losing motivation have to feed it
10:29 - back I'm constantly assessing what I'm
10:32 - doing and I'm constantly thinking about
10:33 - what I'm doing so if it's below my skill
10:36 - level or below what I can truly achieve
10:38 - and do and my ultimate
10:41 - challenge that I could face I cut it out
10:43 - okay I cut it out I cut that out so my
10:49 - ability to cut out things has really
10:51 - helped me improve in a lot of aspects in
10:53 - my life okay becoming whether it be
10:55 - becoming top 1% in chess in the world or
10:58 - becoming you know a lot better at coding
11:00 - earning a six-figure income at a pretty
11:02 - freakin young age having developers
11:05 - under me that I would manage and then
11:07 - starting a business on top of that that
11:10 - did half a million dollars in about year
11:14 - and a half from pure conception okay not
11:18 - even a year and a half honestly a year
11:20 - and just from pure birth of that
11:22 - business right so how did all those
11:24 - things take place it's just because I
11:26 - cut out a lot of doesn't feed my hunger
11:31 - or motivation and I spend up all of my
11:34 - remaining energy and time into things
11:35 - that feed my hunger and motivation right
11:37 - so if you're that if you have the one
11:40 - thing I lack personally okay is
11:42 - consistency it's a challenge for me I'll
11:45 - do things in two to three months
11:47 - obsessive cycles but I can't keep it
11:49 - going because the gas in the tank kind
11:52 - of runs out and I need to go back and
11:54 - refuel or I need to go change the view
11:56 - or I need to go change what I'm
11:58 - basically doing rest for my friend he
12:01 - puts he starts and he just keep going so
12:03 - the challenge for him is to to avoid the
12:05 - bad habits and the bad thought patterns
12:07 - and things that limit him and less
12:09 - challenging things to do not fall into
12:12 - that his challenge is not consistency
12:14 - its challenges cutting out the negative
12:15 - the weird that is happening you know
12:18 - that he might spend his time doing for
12:20 - example checking snapchat constantly
12:23 - checking Instagram constantly posting on
12:27 - Twitter
12:27 - he's extremely consistent with posting
12:29 - on Twitter
12:30 - did you that's probably over 10,000
12:32 - tweets okay but they're not about
12:35 - building a business they're not moving
12:37 - in forward in the direction of his life
12:39 - that he wants to go there just tweets
12:41 - okay so while they're very consistent
12:43 - they might not be moving him forward in
12:46 - life in the way that he might want to go
12:48 - right but now imagine or like let's say
12:51 - watching the office when you're eating
12:53 - food okay you can certainly do that
12:56 - but imagine is changing from watching
12:59 - that one episode of office and replacing
13:01 - it was watching one episode of a
13:03 - tutorial or one episode of udemy or a
13:06 - course or something on YouTube or
13:09 - reading something and one thing you'll
13:11 - realize is that the level of enjoyment
13:16 - that you actually receive from say
13:20 - watching a video right or watching a
13:23 - show so Washington tutorial versus
13:25 - watching a show like the office Game of
13:27 - Thrones the level of enjoyment can
13:29 - actually be the same now that's really
13:31 - surprising to hear right because most
13:33 - people when they think of learning and
13:35 - think of focusing they're just like
13:37 - right there they're actually paying
13:39 - attention to something and I can
13:40 - literally this is what a lot of people
13:42 - look like when they're learning
13:43 - something new or when they're just
13:46 - learning in general instead of watching
13:47 - something entertaining so when they're
13:48 - watching Black Panther and you're
13:50 - watching Game of Thrones they're like
13:55 - but when it comes to learning they're
13:59 - more along the lines of
14:19 - have you ever felt that way I felt that
14:23 - way and I see people feeling that way
14:25 - quite a bit and there's something
14:28 - fundamentally wrong with that that's
14:30 - happening okay and I'm gonna get to the
14:32 - root of this problem very deep problem
14:34 - to understand because they can really
14:36 - change your life the reason why this
14:38 - happens is because the world of
14:40 - academics screws your brain okay I'm
14:45 - talking about middle school I'm talking
14:46 - about high school I'm talking about
14:48 - college and the more you actually go
14:51 - through the formal education system in
14:52 - my opinion you get more more screwed up
14:56 - and here's how explain it because a lot
14:59 - of times school discourages creativity
15:01 - it wants you to follow the herd shut up
15:05 - sit down now write down the notes
15:09 - regurgitate they don't say regurgitate
15:11 - but they want you to regurgitate right
15:13 - they care less about you applying what
15:16 - they teach you creatively
15:17 - they care more about you applying what
15:21 - they teach you in the exact same way
15:23 - that they taught you they care more
15:25 - about you memorizing an example and
15:27 - repeating it or getting it down on the
15:29 - test the same way the teacher explains
15:32 - that so you could ignite his ego and how
15:37 - amazing he felt when he came up with
15:38 - that definition versus you actually
15:41 - being able to creatively apply in in
15:43 - your life and get a double you get a win
15:45 - in your life okay and what that trains
15:48 - you to do is every time you're learning
15:50 - to disengage your brain and just listen
15:54 - to the words without thinking about the
15:55 - meaning and listen to the words without
15:57 - associating to something personal or
15:59 - something that you care about in your
16:01 - life and trying to apply it to your life
16:03 - okay so one thing that made me a really
16:05 - terrible student but a amazing learner
16:09 - one of the fastest learners out of my
16:12 - you know a lot of the peers that I knew
16:14 - and one thing that allowed me to smoke
16:16 - pass a lot of my peers whether it was in
16:18 - chess or coding the reason why that was
16:21 - happening was I was a bad student okay
16:23 - so I got terrible grades because I
16:25 - didn't know how to take notes I didn't
16:27 - know how to regurgitate information the
16:28 - proper way or whatnot because I just
16:30 - didn't care
16:31 - but what I did was every time I learned
16:34 - something I would run to go and apply it
16:37 - okay so if I learn something in physics
16:40 - this is a terrible example but well the
16:44 - first time I learned like how and I
16:46 - forgot all the physics right now because
16:47 - I'm gonna sound dumb but I don't care so
16:49 - the first time I learned physics I was
16:51 - like okay when somebody's falling you
16:52 - know what's the speed that they fall at
16:54 - so you you calculate it probably using
16:56 - the the mass and the acceleration and
17:00 - apparently is equal to force whatever
17:01 - and what I did was I was like what would
17:06 - happen if I fell out of an airplane how
17:08 - long would it take me to actually splat
17:11 - on the floor okay and I would use the
17:13 - new formulas that they gave us actually
17:15 - apply it and then I was sitting down and
17:17 - I was like hmm how would it be if my mom
17:19 - fell out of the airplane and she fell I
17:21 - love my mom but I was thinking about it
17:24 - and I was like you know how would
17:25 - actually calculate that for my mom
17:27 - versus myself and as I learned coding
17:30 - for example what I would do is when I
17:33 - got when I got a concept in physics
17:35 - right so there would be like shoot
17:37 - something at 45-degree angle and that's
17:40 - usually they'll give you that trajectory
17:42 - will give you the best length okay the
17:45 - farthest reach so if it's up you're
17:47 - shooting a catapult
17:48 - shoot at a 45 degree angle or if you're
17:50 - running jump in a 45 degree angle
17:53 - because if you jump too high they'll go
17:54 - too low and if you jump too low you'll
17:56 - get too low but if you jump at a 45
17:58 - degree it'll give you the farthest
17:59 - amount of distance now I could take this
18:02 - at face value and just memorize this
18:04 - fact and then regurgitate it during the
18:05 - test which is what most people do but it
18:08 - doesn't internalize that information in
18:10 - your day to day life so what I would do
18:12 - is I would use coding and with Python
18:16 - coding I created a catapult okay and it
18:21 - would shoot and then I applied physics
18:24 - loss to it so I applied gravity and I
18:26 - applied whatever else like I literally
18:28 - don't remember any of it right now
18:31 - and
18:32 - then I would shoot this catapult at like
18:34 - 90 degree angle at 10 degree angle at
18:37 - 150 degree angle and like all types of
18:39 - different angles and I would see how far
18:41 - it would the ball or whatever would
18:43 - travel okay and what I learned through
18:49 - just testing and trying and playing
18:50 - around with it was that 45 degree was
18:53 - the right answer okay and in all this
18:56 - travel the farthest with 45 degree so
18:58 - that was a lot cooler and a lot more fun
19:00 - to share because I would go with people
19:03 - and I'm like dude look at this like
19:04 - physics it like works in real life like
19:08 - this is crazy you could actually apply
19:09 - physics in real life and actually works
19:11 - this is amazing like you could shoot it
19:14 - from one level to another and it would
19:15 - just work every single time and I would
19:17 - do this in real life
19:19 - when I learned the Pythagorean theorem I
19:20 - try to apply it in real life and even
19:22 - though I wasn't good at math the very
19:24 - basics I was becoming better than other
19:26 - people
19:26 - because I was constantly applying it to
19:28 - my real life whereas if I ask anybody in
19:30 - school or my teachers they would not
19:33 - have a single idea on how any of these
19:35 - concepts apply anywhere just be like
19:37 - well rule applied in calculus don't
19:39 - worry don't apply it in differential
19:41 - equations don't worry already apply it
19:43 - in real life okay how do I apply it in
19:46 - my code how do I apply it like yes
19:48 - theory is good but bro the same reason
19:51 - why you're a teacher and you couldn't
19:52 - get a real job no offense and you're not
19:55 - working at like a laboratory or you're
19:56 - not inventing the next big thing is
19:59 - precisely because you never ask those
20:01 - questions and you yourself don't even
20:03 - know actually where to apply this
20:05 - knowledge okay you know how about you
20:08 - take that algorithm and apply it to
20:11 - something like tinder and create
20:12 - something like tinder you know because
20:13 - at the end of the day they're actually
20:15 - using a complicated algorithm which is
20:18 - like a elo system which is what chess is
20:20 - based on and it rates you okay so tender
20:23 - how it figures out who to match you up
20:26 - with and what choices you should get is
20:28 - basing is giving you an elo rating and
20:31 - based on that rating the other people
20:33 - have a similar rating yet to see you so
20:34 - the people who are way more desirable
20:36 - than you are out of your league so to
20:38 - speak you
20:39 - I never see them and there's no way for
20:41 - you to find out your tinder rating
20:43 - unless you actually speak to the tinder
20:45 - CEO or somebody in the company otherwise
20:48 - they're not allowed to reveal it to you
20:50 - okay
20:50 - but that was some dude taking the math
20:53 - and actually applying it and some real
20:55 - wait just like that when you're learning
20:58 - the same reason why you're bored when
21:00 - you're learning and you can't focus for
21:01 - an extended period of time is you're not
21:02 - relating it to what you can be using it
21:05 - for okay so when I'm sitting there I'm
21:06 - learning like like more like I'm not
21:09 - that good at front-end development okay
21:10 - never spend time on it never really
21:12 - cared about it too much but I'm spending
21:13 - more time on it now
21:14 - because I'm creating a new courses for
21:16 - my students in the profitable programmer
21:18 - as I'm learning more front-end
21:20 - development it's super exciting actually
21:22 - it's a lot of fun to learn front-end
21:24 - development because I could just be
21:26 - sitting there and like full absorb bored
21:28 - but instead what I'm doing is I'll be
21:32 - like wow a query selector like you could
21:35 - select that and change the style of it
21:37 - from just using JavaScript and then I'm
21:40 - never thinking the exact specific
21:41 - example they're giving me in the course
21:43 - I'm thinking of an example that I've
21:45 - come up with on my own
21:47 - so I'm like I love chess I'm like okay
21:49 - if I had a website what I could do is I
21:52 - could create these Styles like a chess
21:54 - board class and every time I put
21:57 - something in HTML that shows a
21:59 - chessboard image and I throw that CSS
22:01 - class on it called chess board it always
22:03 - looks a certain way maybe the image has
22:06 - like a little depth to it or maybe some
22:08 - shadows behind it or maybe or orange
22:10 - color border around it or maybe when you
22:12 - hover over the chess board it colors in
22:15 - a different way and it looks really
22:16 - clean and amazing and when you pick up a
22:19 - piece and you move it somewhere that
22:20 - Square turns green and I'm like oh this
22:24 - dip thing that they're teaching me where
22:25 - I can control a div I can go inside a
22:27 - class right and class might be the chess
22:30 - board and I can go inside a specific div
22:33 - or target a specific ID I could target
22:36 - the idea of one chess square and when I
22:38 - can highlight that one chess square I
22:40 - can change the style of it using CSS so
22:42 - I'm like wow I could use HTML and CSS
22:44 - and JavaScript in this way and then I'm
22:46 - thinking I already have the backend
22:48 - knowledge with Python Django and all
22:50 - that so I could use that back-end
22:51 - knowledge
22:52 - connected to the front end and creates
22:54 - something remarkable create something
22:56 - freakin amazing and it's a lot more fun
23:02 - okay
23:03 - the same way where you know and learning
23:06 - for me watching a video on that is way
23:09 - more fun than watching Black Panther do
23:10 - you like I fell asleep in Black Panther
23:13 - literally like for two hours it was
23:16 - boring it's predictable I hated that
23:18 - movie I literally just like put my
23:20 - jacket and just went to sleep I like
23:22 - watching me like more suspenseful
23:23 - intellectually stimulating films not
23:25 - something that's like super cliche plot
23:26 - armor you know the hero will never die
23:28 - so I put him even in fake danger but
23:31 - something like Game of Thrones you can
23:32 - really it's really suspension of reality
23:33 - because they can actually die but here
23:35 - let me actually connect to the point I
23:37 - was making why coding or whatever
23:39 - learning something intellectually
23:40 - stimulating can actually be so enjoyable
23:41 - take a show like The Office UK or take
23:45 - friends why is it funnier when you are
23:48 - watching season four or season five then
23:51 - just season one how can you just look at
23:54 - Dwight like say in season five right you
23:56 - just you can just like look at Dwight
23:58 - and just see like one facial expression
24:00 - change of his and you'll just burst out
24:02 - laughing whereas somebody who's watching
24:04 - season five for the first time they're
24:06 - just gonna be like this show it's boring
24:08 - why is that a lot more fun for you
24:10 - because you have you have all those like
24:13 - little nuances all those little like
24:16 - baby steps built with Dwight as the
24:18 - character built up you learn the
24:21 - character and now you understand the
24:22 - character at a lot more complex and a
24:25 - deeper level and so you understand that
24:28 - character in all of its facets so when
24:30 - you see that little smile you're
24:31 - connecting it to like every episode of
24:34 - Dwight you've ever seen and what you
24:35 - know about Dwight and what you know
24:37 - about all of the contexts around him so
24:39 - when he's about to pull a prank or he's
24:41 - about to do something in a gym you just
24:42 - automatically start laughing and it's a
24:45 - lot more engaging even when nothing has
24:47 - happened yet and somebody if never
24:49 - watching for the first time it'd just be
24:50 - nonsensical to them or boring to them
24:53 - that's the same reason why the office is
24:56 - funny for a lot funnier for you in
24:58 - season five than season one and same
25:00 - thing for friends okay because you've
25:02 - built that deep rich character
25:04 - relationship and so now it's more
25:06 - intellectually stimulating for you to
25:08 - watch it than somebody's just watching
25:09 - it for the first time
25:10 - same thing with coding tutorials or
25:13 - chess when I'm watching it have so many
25:14 - reference points that it's a lot of fun
25:17 - to watch it because I'm like boom boom
25:18 - boom boom boom and it becomes more and
25:21 - more fun now for me the decision right
25:25 - now for me the decision to actually
25:27 - watch the office or watch coding
25:31 - tutorials is not only easy to make but
25:33 - I'd rather watch the coding tutorial
25:36 - because it's like I'm on season 85 of a
25:41 - coding tutorial when I watch it okay
25:44 - because it's all been building on top of
25:46 - each other so when I watch it I'm like
25:48 - oh like I can connect everything that
25:51 - I've ever known and it's amazing and I
25:53 - can connect how it will all play out
25:56 - creative creatively or in a fun exciting
25:58 - way when you you know connect with it at
26:01 - an intellectual level and understand
26:03 - where your excitement is coming from for
26:07 - things right you're not bored from
26:08 - coding you're just bored because you
26:10 - actually don't really understand in a
26:11 - deeper level and you can't connect it to
26:14 - something you're doing okay so if you
26:16 - have a passion like for my friend right
26:18 - he's a sneaker head when he is watching
26:20 - tutorials he's like falling asleep okay
26:23 - and the reason why he's actually falling
26:24 - asleep when he's watching a lot of just
26:26 - for us because he's thinking of it in a
26:28 - way where he's thinking of it like he's
26:31 - in a class or school class and he's only
26:33 - supposed to take down the notes the
26:35 - teachers saying and his brain literally
26:37 - doesn't even allow his brain to think of
26:39 - any other way to use that information
26:41 - besides in the specific way that the
26:44 - teacher teaches him otherwise he's like
26:46 - I don't know what to think but if he
26:49 - took that time and the same front-end
26:50 - knowledge he's learning could be
26:52 - thinking about oh I can make this
26:53 - amazing sneaker app and when people
26:55 - hover over my shoes that looks beautiful
26:57 - and maybe there's like a little bit of
26:59 - like border behind each shoe or it
27:01 - colors a certain way when the mouse
27:02 - hovers on top of it but when I click Add
27:04 - to Cart Oh
27:06 - when somebody purchases the product I
27:08 - need to store their information what
27:09 - could I use oh I can use a database and
27:12 - I already have learned Python I already
27:14 - have learned Django so I can just use
27:15 - the HTML CSS and JavaScript to create a
27:17 - beautiful front-end connected to my
27:19 - database using Python Django Postgres or
27:22 - whatnot that I already know boom it's an
27:25 - amazing site man I want to maybe just
27:27 - start testing it and maybe I just want
27:29 - to use this already
27:30 - and when he's doing that his eyes would
27:33 - light up he would take in all of the
27:36 - information times ten and he was
27:38 - learning just a much better way and then
27:39 - if you worked on a project for himself
27:42 - using it he that knowledge would be
27:46 - internalized and that knowledge wouldn't
27:48 - just be notes in a notebook that
27:52 - knowledge would actually be part of his
27:53 - knowledge okay so that's what I want to
27:57 - share with you that it's all about like
28:00 - the little habits that you actually
28:02 - build and knowing where your motivation
28:07 - and rear excitement is coming from you
28:09 - can control it okay so for me I know my
28:13 - personality type so I need to read more
28:15 - books like 10x be obsessed or be average
28:18 - you know I'm kind of like kill or be
28:19 - killed like that and I my motivation
28:23 - fluctuates a lot for him it's less of
28:27 - reading motivational stuff he need
28:29 - specially read more informational stuff
28:31 - and he needs to learn specifically how
28:33 - he can make more money he needs to
28:35 - specifically learn the technical skills
28:37 - that are needed to become better at the
28:39 - things that he does okay so based on
28:42 - what personality type you are right and
28:44 - how much motivation meter you need to
28:46 - fill up to go you can decide what you
28:49 - need to read what you need to consume
28:51 - what kind of friends you need to be
28:52 - around for him maybe he needs to be
28:55 - around more technical friends okay for
28:57 - me maybe I need to be around friends who
29:01 - are just keep pushing me okay push me
29:03 - I'd like a really high level doesn't
29:05 - matter if they have a high technical
29:06 - capability or not but they're just you
29:09 - know they're almost infectious or what's
29:11 - a better way they're contagious with
29:13 - their enthusiasm so to speak using that
29:16 - you can figure that out okay
29:17 - using
29:18 - what type of personality or how much gas
29:20 - you need you can figure out what books
29:21 - you need to take in and what kind of
29:23 - information you need to take in and then
29:24 - understanding at a deeper subconscious
29:26 - level where your excitement is coming
29:28 - from and the little habits right it's a
29:31 - little habit of maybe watching a show
29:33 - man it's just one night like I just want
29:36 - to relax I came back from my
29:37 - nine-to-five I'm a little tired let me
29:39 - just watch a show if you just changed
29:43 - that habit to watching let's say a
29:46 - tutorial okay
29:49 - over the course of a year you have a
29:51 - thousand hours of coding tutorials under
29:53 - your belt and you're a real front-end
29:56 - developer or you could be that other guy
29:59 - who could spend a one-year watch the
30:01 - office and now he's watching a lot of
30:02 - the office but he has zero coding skills
30:05 - okay so even though it won't take effect
30:07 - right away but over the course of six
30:09 - months or a year this is a compound
30:12 - effect on steroids okay and it'll get
30:15 - you to where you want to go people ask
30:17 - me how did you become so good at chess
30:18 - in such a short amount of time the thing
30:20 - I did something incredible you know what
30:21 - I did literally every time I would go to
30:23 - sleep as I was falling asleep put my
30:25 - laptop to the side and set up watching
30:27 - shows I'd be like oh man I want to watch
30:29 - this game by Carlson against like klom
30:32 - Nick put my laptop and just watch that
30:35 - game and show wow what an amazing rook
30:38 - lifts oh my god he's attacking his King
30:40 - side that's such an amazing idea while
30:42 - defending his Queen side Wow like I
30:45 - could be doing that oh that tactic
30:46 - literally the same enjoyment you get
30:48 - from watching Game of Thrones I got from
30:51 - Washington's tutorials and while other
30:53 - people just had a database of actors
30:57 - that didn't you and episodes that they
30:59 - could refer to I had a database of real
31:01 - skill sets that I could actually rely on
31:03 - that got me high paying jobs so
31:06 - understand your what your drives our
31:08 - motivation and change your little habits
31:11 - using what you know about excitement
31:13 - enthusiasm and what drives you and
31:15 - motivates you and you'll have just as
31:18 - much fun eating ice cream as you will
31:20 - eating lean chicken using that you can
31:23 - have just as much fun as putting on 50
31:26 - pounds of fat versus taking all 50
31:28 - pounds of fat
31:29 - using this you could have just as much
31:31 - fun getting a six-figure income or
31:34 - turning your business and getting it to
31:36 - seven figures Oh in a few years versus
31:39 - just making thirty thousand dollars a
31:41 - year for the rest of your life and using
31:43 - this you could have just as much fun
31:45 - having an amazing marriage that you're
31:47 - proud of with amazing children or just
31:50 - an amazing wife or amazing girlfriend
31:52 - versus having an average wife average
31:55 - girlfriend average life average friends
31:57 - okay that's it for this video thank you
32:00 - so much for watching do comment below if
32:02 - you resonated with something because um
32:04 - I'm trying to change the type of content
32:07 - I produce I want to go much deeper
32:08 - rather than a lot narrower so I want to
32:11 - build a herd of people who are a lot
32:14 - more deeply engaging rather than just
32:17 - like this fluff of high subscribers and
32:19 - high numbers I'm kind of losing a lot of
32:21 - motivation by then I don't want to do
32:22 - that anymore
32:23 - so if this resonates with you and you
32:25 - are watching is the deeper intellectual
32:26 - level and you understand what I'm saying
32:28 - and you know please leave a comment and
32:30 - do let me know I'll really appreciate it
32:32 - and it'll help me make more of these
32:33 - videos okay to be honest that's kind of
32:35 - what I need at this point that's it
32:38 - thank you so much for watching as always
32:39 - I love you and I will see you in the
32:42 - next video
32:47 - [Music]
