00:00 - (upbeat music)
00:06 - - Hey you, what is up?
00:07 - This is Qazi from Cleverprogrammer.com.
00:10 - Today I'm here with Brennan
Dunn and he's the founder
00:14 - of DoubleYourFreelancing.com and this guy,
00:18 - you know a lot of us on
this channel wanna learn
00:21 - about freelancing and we're developers
00:24 - and how can we actually
increase our income?
00:26 - This is somebody who has
helped many many developers
00:29 - and pretty much primarily--
- Mostly developers, yeah.
00:31 - - Mostly developers increase their income
00:34 - so I thought it'd be
great to just sit down
00:36 - and chat with Brennan Dunn.
00:38 - So thanks so much for
being here, and welcome.
00:40 - - Yeah, thank you, thanks for having me.
00:41 - - We have lots of Python developers
00:44 - and we have people also in
lots of different countries.
00:47 - Now when people are trying
to become developers
00:50 - is there sometimes a
common objection you hear
00:53 - with oh, I'm in a different country,
00:55 - or there are people competing with us
00:58 - from a different market so we
can't really become developers
01:01 - or how do we charge?
01:03 - How do you deal with
that when people ask you
01:05 - those types of questions?
01:07 - - Yeah, so the question is--
01:08 - - And you can even hold this.
01:09 - - Okay cool.
01:11 - Yeah, so I mean in terms of things like,
01:13 - oh I'm in a certain
country or I wanna work,
01:16 - like the typically one would
be, I wanna work with Americans
01:18 - but I'm out of the U.S.
or something like that.
01:20 - How do I get American clients?
01:22 - Is that kinda what you're getting at?
01:23 - - Yes.
- Yeah.
01:24 - I mean I think like I've
both hired and worked with
01:27 - and helped a lot of people
who are geographically
01:31 - not where their clients are, all right.
01:32 - And I think the big concern and I think,
01:35 - which is sometimes correct,
is there's a cultural
01:39 - or a language gap or something like that
01:40 - between them and their clients.
01:42 - At the end of the day
I think, the best thing
01:45 - that you can do as a
developers, doesn't matter
01:48 - where you're located,
what framework or language
01:50 - you code in or anything else like that,
01:53 - is the thing that helped me.
01:54 - So my backstory was I was freelance.
01:57 - I worked remotely, I've
never really worked on site
02:00 - or anything for a client.
02:00 - So it's always been a remote.
02:02 - - Always been remote.
- Always been remote.
02:03 - - Interesting.
- I've never done on site.
02:04 - - Great.
02:05 - - Which is a good thing, I think.
02:05 - - Yeah, that's great.
02:07 - That's what a lot of our developers wanna
02:09 - be able to do, work remotely.
02:10 - - Yeah, yeah.
02:12 - And typically, I mean if you're
doing like contract work,
02:14 - then you're on site and
you might be independent
02:17 - but you're still kind of like,
02:18 - you're basically staff augmentation
02:20 - or something like that, right?
02:21 - You're in-house.
02:23 - So I think, I transitioned
out of being freelance
02:27 - to owning an agency.
02:29 - And I grew that agency to 11 employees,
02:31 - we did software development,
that was our thing.
02:33 - - Great.
- The thing that
02:34 - helped the most for us, 'cause none
02:36 - of our clients were local.
02:39 - We were in the U.S., working
primarily with U.S. companies,
02:41 - but we worked with companies in Japan,
02:44 - we worked with companies in South America
02:46 - and pretty much all over.
02:47 - But I think the thing that
I think was most beneficial
02:51 - to us to set us apart
was we were laser focused
02:54 - on what is the problem that
they're paying us to solve?
02:59 - - Yes.
- Right?
03:00 - So instead of just saying,
"Oh I'm a good Python dev.
03:02 - "Oh I know Django, I know
this, that or whatever."
03:06 - The clients that I think
you typically want to get
03:08 - are the ones who might not
even know what Python is,
03:11 - or might not care.
03:12 - They just want a problem fixed.
03:15 - So for us, we shifted away
from, all right so realizing
03:19 - no one's paying us tens
of thousands of dollars
03:21 - for lines of code.
03:22 - They're paying us 'cause
they need something R&D'd,
03:26 - they need help with the research even
03:29 - and not just the development
of certain products.
03:31 - They need help in figuring
out how should these be built,
03:34 - why should they be built
in a certain way and so on.
03:36 - And we ended up not only
being able to charge
03:39 - a lot more and kind of being
able to get to the point
03:41 - where we had this great profitable team
03:43 - and everything else, but we
were able to really get away
03:47 - from marketing ourselves
as a development shop
03:50 - and instead focusing on,
03:52 - I mean it sounds really
enterprisy and kinda cringy,
03:54 - but you know as a solutions
provider who happened
03:56 - and we used, I know you're--
03:58 - - Solution.
03:59 - - (mumbles) we were a Ruby shop.
04:02 - - Nice.
04:03 - - But at the end of the day
we didn't describe ourselves
04:05 - as Ruby developers.
04:07 - Our clients, most of our
clients didn't even know
04:09 - we used Rails or what Rails
was or anything like that.
04:12 - - Got it.
- Yeah.
04:13 - - Okay so that's fantastic.
04:14 - So one of the things that I got from that
04:16 - was to focus on what
their main problem is,
04:20 - it doesn't really matter.
04:21 - - That's why they're paying you.
04:21 - - Why are they paying you, right?
04:23 - Instead of focusing on
oh this is what I do,
04:27 - Python and Django and then
trying to look for that.
04:29 - Now, a lot of the people who
are watching this channel
04:32 - are either beginners in coding
04:34 - or that's most of the people watching,
04:38 - then there's a segment who are developers,
04:40 - but wanna start freelancing.
04:42 - So what would be your advice
on people getting their first,
04:47 - so let's say, let's speak to beginners.
04:49 - Let's say, if they wanna
get their first client.
04:51 - - Right.
04:52 - - If you had to go back in time,
04:53 - how would you approach your coding,
04:57 - like picking up the coding skills
04:59 - and then at what point in
time would you start going
05:02 - for clients and how would
you get that first client?
05:04 - If you just had to reverse
engineer that journey?
05:06 - - Yeah, good question, so with me,
05:08 - you know I started freelancing
after I was already
05:11 - a senior developer, right?
05:13 - So I didn't need to both
acquire skills on how to code
05:18 - while also acquire skills
on how to freelance, right?
05:21 - So, I think if I were to
go, like wake up tomorrow,
05:24 - have no business, and not
really great as a developer
05:28 - or even knowing how to
code, I think in retrospect,
05:31 - what I would probably do
would be to immerse myself
05:35 - as much as possible in,
and again I know this isn't
05:38 - always practical depending
on where you live,
05:39 - but in the local business community.
05:41 - Just keep my ear to the ground and listen
05:43 - to what they're up to, what do they do?
05:45 - And just be really
interested in seeing like
05:47 - what are they doing?
05:48 - Maybe they're doing a bunch
of stuff with like Excel
05:52 - and they're kinda hitting
the upper limits of what,
05:55 - but maybe you're talking with people
05:56 - and they're using Excel
and they're passing Excel
05:58 - spreadsheets around the
office and this is a core
06:01 - part of their internal workflow.
06:03 - And I might think well, maybe
I could just do something
06:06 - with Zapier or something, right?
06:09 - I can make it so, I can consult with them
06:12 - to say let's use Google Sheets
06:14 - and then we'll have
Zapier that will pick up
06:16 - on row changes and then
when certain things are done
06:20 - we maybe shoot off an email.
06:22 - Or there's a lot you can do now-a-days
06:24 - which were, when I started out none
06:26 - of this stuff was possible,
that you can do with
06:28 - effectively off the shelf things
06:30 - that get you in the same
programming mindset, right?
06:33 - Of like, even the stuff
we're doing in here
06:35 - in this conference, the automation stuff,
06:38 - I mean, you're doing
if/else and segmentation.
06:42 - I mean it's pretty much
the same kind of mental
06:45 - stuff you're doing as a developer.
06:47 - So I think it would help there,
06:48 - and then you can obviously
get more into code
06:51 - and such as you need to.
06:52 - But if the goal is to make
money with paying clients
06:55 - as quickly as possible,
I would not personally
06:59 - try to dive head first
into learning a whole
07:04 - giant Python framework
or something day one.
07:06 - - Wow.
07:07 - - I would probably
start with what can I do
07:10 - to deliver business
value in a technical way
07:13 - that just might not be super technical,
07:14 - but at least it's technical enough.
07:16 - - Yeah that's fascinating.
07:17 - - And I'd start with that
and then probably go deeper.
07:20 - - Okay, so that's a
really fascinating answer
07:22 - because what I love about it is it,
07:26 - because of what happens
with people is they're often
07:28 - trying to tackle the complexity
of learning how to code
07:31 - with the complexity of learning
how to build a business
07:36 - at the same time.
07:37 - I think both of those things are difficult
07:40 - when you're trying, they're
difficult on their own,
07:42 - then they get very
difficult if you're trying
07:44 - to do them both together.
07:46 - - Right.
- Simultaneously.
07:47 - And what you're saying
is, hey, break them apart
07:50 - a little bit, so do one thing first.
07:53 - So for example, in this
case, maybe instead
07:56 - of just diving deep into
Python and spending the next
08:00 - six months to three years
and still not feeling
08:03 - like a good enough developer
to be able to freelance,
08:05 - which is most people's story around it,
08:09 - you focus on going and
keeping your ear to the local
08:13 - businesses and seeing
if you can provide value
08:16 - in somewhat of a technical way.
08:18 - And it doesn't even
have to be with Python.
08:20 - What's funny that you say that is,
08:21 - when I built my Chess business
a really long time ago,
08:24 - it was called Chesstastic and we would,
08:27 - I would find schools
and I would go to them
08:30 - and I would offer them Chess services.
08:32 - But how I would find these schools,
08:35 - because I was constantly finding
myself Googling everything.
08:38 - And the Googling got really,
it was really laborious
08:42 - and really, but then
I would always looking
08:44 - for certain criteria from these schools.
08:46 - Like they had to have, these
libraries would have to have
08:52 - ages eight through 11 year-olds,
08:54 - for me to be able to teach there.
08:56 - There should have these
other recreational programs.
08:59 - Then I created an Excel sheet
that would automatically
09:01 - do all this stuff.
09:02 - - So you were like scraping these pages
09:04 - and pushing it in Excel, yeah.
09:06 - - Yep, and I didn't even know
how to code at that point.
09:08 - - Right.
- So I was just using
09:09 - Excel functionalities and
then I got off of Excel
09:14 - until I literally maximized it.
09:16 - So like I had to get
off of it when it said
09:18 - like NA or something, because
I was getting throttled
09:22 - with API and I didn't
even know what that meant.
09:24 - - Yeah, yeah right.
09:25 - - So I hired a developer for that.
09:25 - - But you learned, doing that
you learned the mental stuff
09:30 - that would help you as
a developer later on.
09:32 - - Correct.
- Yeah.
09:33 - - Correct, so I learned
so much of the stuff
09:36 - that would help me as
a developer later on.
09:38 - So I think that what you're
saying is really valuable
09:41 - to the viewers who are watching,
09:42 - because if they can right now,
09:45 - focus more on the business side of things,
09:47 - doing things that are
maybe more technical.
09:49 - Like for example, they can go to a place
09:53 - where there are like a lot of old people
09:56 - who don't know how to install an antivirus
09:59 - on their computer.
- Yeah, yeah.
10:01 - - You know it's like you can help them.
10:03 - You can charge them, and
then you can get more complex
10:05 - with it depending on
what your skill level is.
10:08 - Maybe you can help businesses
with more technical service.
10:11 - - So I've got an example
that actually came
10:13 - from a local networking
event I went to years ago.
10:16 - Local to me in Virginia.
10:18 - And that was, I was doing the agency thing
10:22 - and we were just networking
and talking with people,
10:25 - just at the bar, like drink up thing.
10:28 - It was after a meetup.
10:29 - And the guy was saying, "Oh I'm trying to,
10:33 - "I have all these customers
and I wanna find out,
10:35 - "I wanna get them all
to be able to fill out
10:39 - "a quick little form thing
and then pay me for,"
10:42 - It was like a certification
thing that he was selling.
10:44 - "And then I wanna be able to get all that
10:46 - "into a spreadsheet."
10:46 - And he's like, "So you
guys are developers,
10:48 - "can you build that for me?"
10:49 - And the coder in me was thinking,
10:52 - you know that's a lot of
early developers start
10:54 - with C.R.U.D. apps, right?
10:55 - Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete.
10:57 - - Right.
- Where it's basically
10:58 - forms and index lists
and you're able to view,
11:02 - that kinda stuff, right?
11:03 - Whereas in retrospect,
if I could go back then,
11:07 - and I wasn't having my
like Rails coder hat on,
11:10 - I would have said, use Google Forms.
11:14 - Use Zapier or something to
push that into a Google Sheet.
11:17 - Although that'll do it
automatic with Google Forms.
11:20 - You know, push it into a spread sheet
11:21 - and then have a way to
then send out an automated
11:25 - email after they do that
with a link to PayPal
11:27 - or you know, some dumb
shit like that, right?
11:29 - - Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- That is really not
11:31 - sophisticated, but it solves that problem
11:34 - where the client, like the
client in this case needs,
11:37 - this is what I need to get done,
11:38 - and they don't know.
11:38 - Like most people, you
look out here in Boise,
11:41 - ask anyone like do you Zapier's a thing
11:43 - and that they can link
all these different data
11:44 - things you do together?
11:46 - They say no.
11:47 - Like most people, most
business people don't know
11:49 - this stuff exists.
11:50 - So you just say hey, I wanna learn enough
11:52 - about what I can do with a tool Zapier,
11:55 - an off the shelf tool
and I'm just gonna glue
11:57 - things together and give
them what they need.
11:59 - And then that'll at least fund you
12:01 - while you can then go and
learn Python or learn whatever.
12:04 - I mean that's what I
would do if I needed money
12:06 - and I wasn't technically skilled enough
12:09 - to be able to safely bring
on a greenfield project
12:12 - and say, I'm gonna code you a
Python project from scratch.
12:15 - - Yes.
- So that's what I would do.
12:16 - - Okay, so that's really great advice
12:19 - because people work backwards.
- Yeah.
12:21 - - Which to them seems like the normal way,
12:23 - which is like go to college,
go to college for four years,
12:27 - then go get your masters
for like two to four years,
12:30 - then think about maybe
contemplate getting a job,
12:35 - but probably still don't do
that, 'cause that's crazy.
12:38 - And I feel like it's such
a backwards approach.
12:41 - Where the job is the goal, or
being able to provide value
12:45 - is a goal, but nobody spends time thinking
12:47 - about that most of the times.
12:48 - - Well even great developers,
12:48 - I mean even great developers aren't even,
12:50 - I know really talented coders
12:53 - who do not ever think, how
is the code I'm writing
12:56 - making an impact on the business
that is using this code.
13:00 - - Wow.
13:00 - - You know a lot of them are just thinking
13:01 - I'm building a really,
you know they geek out
13:03 - on object oriented coding
and test driven development
13:06 - and that's all good.
13:07 - Like I remember when we
started getting heavily
13:10 - into TDD, or Test Driven
Development as an agency,
13:13 - I had clients who were trying to sell.
13:15 - And they were like, "Why
should I pay you all this extra
13:17 - "money so you can write these test things?
13:18 - "Shouldn't your code work the first time?"
13:20 - Right?
13:21 - And it became difficult for us to,
13:25 - how do we sell testing?
13:26 - - Yeah, what did you do?
- But then,
13:28 - Well here's what I did is I was talking
13:31 - to a friend of mine who
was running also an agency,
13:33 - and he's like sell it as insurance.
13:36 - Like the idea is a good
test suite on a code base
13:39 - is going to be that canary in a coal mine
13:42 - if new features that you've
developed broke something else.
13:45 - And the most expensive part
of software development
13:48 - which a lot of clients don't get,
13:50 - is the maintenance costs.
13:53 - - Wow.
- Now the total cost
13:54 - of ownership is not always
13:55 - the building, it's the maintaining.
13:57 - So if you're adding new features
13:58 - and this is breaking
that, you know that's,
14:01 - not only does that cost a
lot more in development time,
14:03 - but you've got, if it's in production,
14:06 - if you've got customers
using it who are getting
14:08 - error messages and this and that,
14:10 - and it's basically an insurance policy,
14:11 - where you're saying, we
can safely and agilely
14:14 - develop new functionality in the future
14:17 - without needing to worry about,
14:18 - so basically you're buying insurance
14:20 - that will keep your long term costs down.
14:22 - So we sold it like that.
- Smart.
14:24 - - Instead of saying yeah,
we're gonna spend twice
14:26 - as much time so we can write these tests
14:28 - that are, like I get it.
14:31 - Clients are thinking
why can't you write code
14:34 - that works the first time, right?
14:36 - 'Cause they don't know.
14:36 - And you can't blame them.
14:37 - It's just I think a lot
of us get kind of arrogant
14:40 - and they're like, "They
should understand the value
14:41 - "of testing and they should know why we
14:43 - "object oriented design,
14:44 - "why we do these craftsmanship things."
14:47 - Like in the Ruby community
there's a big push
14:49 - on code craftsmanship, which is good,
14:52 - but I think people get
so immersed in the--
14:54 - - Yeah code craftsmanship.
14:55 - - Yeah, and I think the reason developers
14:59 - tend to sell themselves
on the technicals are,
15:04 - that's what they're, it's
comfortable, it's safe.
15:07 - - Yes.
15:07 - - I've been doing coding
for the last many years,
15:09 - I'm good at it, I'm not
confident in my ability
15:12 - to help businesses, but
I'm confident in my ability
15:14 - to write code, so I'm gonna
focus just on the code stuff.
15:17 - And then they wonder, why
am I being price chopped
15:20 - and why am I you know, struggling so much?
15:23 - And it's because, if you can
focus on what is my code doing?
15:28 - And it unfortunately becomes a thing
15:30 - where you need to realize,
15:31 - and this is, I think, hard
for people to sometimes get,
15:34 - that no one cares about your code.
15:35 - No one cares about any of that.
15:37 - They just want the result.
- Heartbreaking.
15:38 - - Yeah it is.
- Heartbreaking.
15:40 - - It is if it's your craft.
15:41 - You wanna talk designers.
15:44 - When you tell designers
about like, no one cares
15:47 - about your design, they just wanna know
15:48 - how does this design increase
conversions or whatever else?
15:50 - - Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
15:51 - - They get very sometimes, yeah.
15:55 - - Brilliant and I love
that because eventually
15:58 - a lot of this stuff has
to tie down to results.
16:01 - A lot of the people who
are paying these developers
16:03 - are business owners,
- Correct.
16:05 - - Who need some kind of
return on their investment,
16:07 - but I feel that the
developer who's competing
16:11 - and struggling with a
developer in Pakistan
16:14 - or India or Bangladesh,
charging $7 an hour
16:19 - is because they're--
16:21 - - Well they're commoditizing, I mean it's,
16:24 - think of it like, so
we're by a street, right?
16:26 - There's probably a gas station somewhere.
16:28 - You know often gas stations,
16:29 - there's one across the
street from the other, right?
16:31 - - Yeah.
- If this one's 20 bucks
16:33 - a gallon and that one's two,
16:36 - why would you ever go
to the $20 one, right?
16:39 - - Yes.
16:40 - - And that's why if
you're selling yourself
16:41 - as a Python developer and you're saying
16:44 - I want a hundred bucks an
hour to write Python code,
16:46 - and the client's like, "But,
there's these guys over here,
16:49 - "who're $7 an hour to write Python code.
16:51 - "Why should I pay you?"
16:52 - - Yeah.
16:53 - - And it's like how do
you answer that, right?
16:54 - You're saying, I am selling a commodity
16:57 - which is Python code and then
the client rightfully thinks,
17:01 - well what's the going
rate for Python code?
17:03 - I mean a lot of the, I
don't do consulting anymore,
17:05 - but when I did, a lot
of what I did would be
17:08 - going to people's email
marketing automation stuff,
17:11 - writing a lot of JavaScript
code and writing copy.
17:13 - Email copy.
17:14 - But I didn't sell that.
17:15 - I sold like how I'm
gonna help them onboard
17:18 - their clients better, and sell more stuff
17:20 - and this and that, but
technically I was writing
17:23 - a lot of JavaScript, I was
doing some markup stuff
17:25 - on their site and some copy writing.
17:28 - And then gluing it together in
like an email marketing app.
17:31 - But I wasn't saying, and a lot of it,
17:34 - I mean if you read like the last one I did
17:37 - was $89,000 for something
that took about three weeks.
17:41 - - Wow.
- Which the equivalent
17:42 - hourly rate of that is insane
17:44 - and if they were thinking
what's the going rate
17:47 - of a copy writer?
17:48 - But instead, I positioned it as here's,
17:51 - we've talked through your numbers,
17:52 - I've seen your company,
here's what I think you could
17:54 - be doing and here's how
I think it could make you
17:57 - six figures plus within the first year.
17:59 - So then I come in and I bring in my price
18:01 - and I'm an investment at that point.
18:03 - I'm showing you're spending
this, but here's what you're
18:06 - gonna be getting because this is a gap
18:10 - in what you have set up.
18:11 - And I think getting confident
in people's abilities
18:15 - to be able to affect businesses that way,
18:17 - that's the struggle that
I think people have.
18:18 - - Got it. Okay.
18:19 - And so if I wanna,
18:21 - if I want to like okay, I
understand maybe I'm a developer,
18:25 - I'm watching this or maybe I'm a beginner
18:27 - wanting to get into
freelancing watching this,
18:29 - and I'm going okay,
makes sense that I need
18:31 - to be able to position
myself like an investment,
18:34 - show people there's an ROI correlated
18:36 - with what efforts I'm
gonna be bringing in,
18:40 - but now maybe they're thinking,
18:41 - what amount of time am I
spending actually learning
18:44 - coding and increasing my coding skills,
18:46 - versus learning business
and marketing skills?
18:50 - So how would that be broken
up for somebody who's new?
18:54 - - Yeah good question.
18:54 - So yeah the balance of where
do you spend your time?
18:58 - I think at the end of the day I mean
19:00 - I would treat both, I mean I still,
19:03 - I'm a coder by heart, but
now I'm running a software
19:05 - company and all these other things,
19:06 - but I still code and I enjoy it.
19:08 - I mean it's therapeutic for me.
19:09 - I think a lot of people
who are drawn into that
19:11 - still like it, right?
19:13 - - Yes, yeah.
19:14 - - So I think at the end of the day,
19:16 - the easy out, the easy
route with consulting
19:19 - would be to get subcontracted full time
19:22 - through an agency.
19:24 - Let them get the clients, let
them deal with the clients.
19:27 - You just sit at the coffee
shop with your headphones on
19:29 - and write code.
19:29 - And that's the thing,
but the problem then is,
19:32 - they're not your clients,
they're the agency's clients
19:35 - and you should, everyone
should be a business of one,
19:41 - regardless of what you do, I think.
19:44 - That should be the goal.
19:45 - So I think it's worth your
while to always be thinking
19:48 - well why am I getting paid for this?
19:50 - Why are they paying me for this code?
19:52 - And getting better, and this
doesn't mean you need to be
19:55 - full on business consultant.
19:56 - You can still be a developer
who is just pragmatic
20:00 - in saying, "Look, I wanna
know why you're paying me
20:01 - "and what do you need to get from me?"
20:04 - What is the outcome, the
business outcome you need?
20:06 - 'Cause the end goal might be,
20:08 - I remember one of my
early consulting clients,
20:11 - they were hiring us to build a thing
20:13 - that would match make bars and
restaurants with musicians.
20:17 - - Okay.
- Right?
20:18 - So like if you've got a bar or coffee shop
20:21 - and you wanna have a
guitarist playing music,
20:23 - it would be a way to do that, right?
20:25 - Like a marketplace.
20:27 - And early on he wanted, he was like,
20:29 - "Oh well what do
marketplaces probably have?"
20:31 - 'Cause he'd seen ones online.
20:33 - And he wanted private
messaging and groups and stuff.
20:37 - And I was like at that point, I was like,
20:39 - "Look, what you need
is you need validation
20:42 - "that this works."
20:44 - Right?
20:45 - Like you don't have any
users on your platform
20:46 - to message each other, so why
do you want messaging day one?
20:49 - So I was able to help affect,
20:52 - I was able to reduce the scope early on
20:54 - and focus more on what should be built,
20:57 - 'cause the client just thought
look, I have my ear to,
21:00 - I'm reading hacker news,
I'm reading all this stuff
21:02 - about like startups that are failing
21:04 - and why they're failing
and what's dong well
21:06 - and these new frameworks coming out
21:08 - and the heart bleed Wordpress issue
21:11 - or no what was it, anyway,
21:14 - like all these different things, right?
21:15 - That was, I think with Nginx,
but all these different things
21:18 - that the majority of
business owners don't know.
21:23 - So just the fact that I
have my ear to the ground
21:26 - in that sense is helpful to people.
21:29 - And yeah, at the end of the day my job
21:31 - is just to think I wanna
always be making myself
21:35 - more valuable by getting better at coding
21:37 - and a lot of getting better at
coding comes with experience,
21:40 - obviously that's the ultimate thing.
21:42 - But also learning new frameworks
21:44 - and seeing where the wind's blowing
21:45 - and seeing oh Laravel's a big thing,
21:47 - I should go maybe check that out.
21:48 - Or this or that.
21:50 - So that should be something
we're always doing,
21:53 - continuing education, but
I think just the fact,
21:55 - the best business education
I think you can get
21:58 - is to start just going to like the,
22:00 - you go to meetup.com, go find
out where business owners
22:03 - congregate, whether
it's Chamber of Commerce
22:06 - after-party things that they do,
22:08 - or like the networking events
and conferences like this.
22:11 - - What do you think about
if they just offered
22:12 - some advice for even,
offered to help even for free
22:15 - in the start?
22:16 - - Yeah I mean, I don't
like giving anything
22:19 - of value away for free individually.
22:21 - I think it's fine at scale.
22:23 - So I don't mind, you could do
like maybe you do a workshop.
22:27 - Maybe you do a, some sort
of digital thing, like a,
22:32 - My friend Amy Hoy did a thing on,
22:34 - when Rails came out back in 2006 or seven
22:37 - I think is when she did
it, she did a free PDF
22:40 - about how the internals of Rails works.
22:43 - It was just a graphical PDF thing.
22:45 - And she just learned this
stuff through whatever,
22:47 - I mean look at people like Chris Coyier
22:49 - of CSS-Tricks, right?
22:50 - Like any time you Google
CSS related he pops up.
22:54 - But if you look at his backstory,
22:55 - he was teaching himself CSS and blogging
22:58 - about what he was learning.
23:00 - - Wow, yeah.
23:01 - - And that's how he came
to be what he's doing now.
23:04 - So I think the best thing you could do
23:04 - would just be to, even
if you don't have readers
23:07 - or you don't think you have
readers or anything like that,
23:09 - just document yourself and put it online.
23:12 - Today I learned this or I had a client
23:14 - and they asked about this and here what,
23:16 - you know and eventually
you have this monster thing
23:19 - of content that ends up
making you authoritative
23:24 - to some people and
that's another great way
23:26 - to kinda become a premium consultant
23:28 - is to build up an audience
and do things like that.
23:29 - - I know Pat Flynn had this
lead exam thing, ya know?
23:33 - - Yeah.
23:34 - - Before he started
Nathan Berry also talked.
23:36 - - That's what Nathan did.
23:37 - Yeah, we all do that.
23:39 - We all, I mean half of the
reason I just gave a workshop
23:42 - here and was asked to speak here,
23:44 - was 'cause all I do always,
talk about what I'm doing.
23:49 - What I'm learning and
how this isn't working
23:51 - the way I thought it would,
and oh this is what ended up
23:53 - working and so on.
23:54 - And all this stuff didn't come overnight,
23:57 - it's just a culmination
of learning in public.
23:59 - - Yes, I agree.
- Yeah.
24:01 - - Okay, so for a lot of
the beginner developers
24:05 - or developers who are experienced,
24:07 - I think freelancing it's a really good way
24:09 - to get into kinda the tips you shared.
24:12 - Like maybe even get in a non-technical way
24:14 - in the start just so you can
kinda get the freelancing
24:17 - skill down, the business skills down.
24:19 - - Learn to sell.
24:20 - - Yeah, and you start really
focusing on the value, right?
24:22 - For example I had this one student
24:25 - who joined our program
at Profitable Programmer,
24:27 - he got a client to build their website,
24:30 - and then he's like trying
to build her website,
24:33 - and he's spending so much time using it,
24:35 - trying to build it with Python and Django,
24:38 - and I asked him, "What does she need?"
24:39 - and he said, "Contact
page and about me page."
24:42 - - Like use Squarspace.
24:44 - - I'm like, "Why don't you
just fucking use Squarespace?"
24:46 - - Yeah. (laughs)
24:47 - - And then he kinda got
in a fight with me almost,
24:49 - where he's like, well
that's what you know Python
24:51 - and Django and that's
what the course was about.
24:53 - And I'm like, "Who cares
what the course was about?"
24:56 - This is what you should do.
24:57 - It'll take you five minutes.
24:59 - - Yep, at the end of the
day Django and Squarespace
25:02 - are both emitting HTML.
25:04 - And Squarespace probably
does it a bit easier,
25:06 - and a bit, in this case like you said,
25:08 - if they need a marketing site,
25:10 - there's nothing dynamic about it.
25:12 - Like what do you need Python for?
25:13 - Ya know?
- Right.
25:14 - - Like there's nothing,
you don't need a proper CMS
25:17 - in that sense.
- Yes.
25:19 - - But yeah, I mean you should still,
25:20 - if a client needs that genuinely,
then by all means, yeah.
25:24 - - Yeah, and I do think
there's a bit of like
25:27 - them having to detach, like
oh, because I'm learning
25:30 - this skill it must be this way.
25:32 - - Must be done that way, yep.
25:33 - - Honestly when I started freelancing
25:35 - I kinda got started very
early, like three to six months
25:38 - into my just picking up coding.
25:41 - I posted ads on Craig's List for tutoring.
25:44 - Somebody called me and they were like
25:45 - "We need a login system,
authentication system,"
25:48 - like blah blah blah, they're like,
25:50 - "Can you do it?"
25:51 - I'm like, "I'm your fucking man."
25:52 - - Yeah.
25:52 - - I had no idea what I
was doing at that point.
25:55 - That's when I actually
started learning and I went.
25:59 - So Pat Flynn was talking
about just in time learning.
26:02 - So that really resonated with me.
26:03 - And a lot of what you're talking about,
26:06 - it sounds like take the
practical steps first,
26:09 - maybe even start earning an income first
26:11 - and then right?
26:13 - Okay, now for people who wanna increase
26:16 - their freelancing rate, so
people who wanna be able
26:19 - to charge premium pricing
26:21 - and since there are a lot of developers
26:23 - who aren't like freelancers yet,
26:25 - I think what would be a
valuable perspective for them
26:28 - is how do you, how are you at some point
26:32 - able to charge more than say $35 an hour
26:36 - or $50 an hour or $150 an hour?
26:41 - So they can kinda visualize and see
26:43 - what that might look
like, so starting today,
26:46 - they can start to frame
themselves in that way?
26:49 - - Yeah, good question,
so easiest would be don't
26:53 - bill for time.
26:54 - I think that's the,
26:56 - I think the problem with billing for time
26:59 - is that you're ultimately reducing it down
27:01 - to how the sausage is made
in the factory, right?
27:05 - It's ultimately, it's not
focused on the outcome,
27:08 - it's focused on the time required
27:10 - to deliver an outcome.
27:12 - I always butcher the, there's
this example people give
27:16 - of like some IBM consultant in the 50s
27:18 - who goes into this thing,
27:20 - - The hammer?
27:21 - - The hammer, hits the thing
and he charges 50 grand.
27:23 - - Right.
27:23 - - And they're like, "Why are
you charging so much money to,"
27:25 - He's like, "All the experience
that went into knowing
27:28 - "where it is I'm gonna hammer."
27:29 - Right?
- Yep.
27:30 - And then Pablo Picasso
something like that too,
27:33 - he throws his painting in
the garbage or something,
27:36 - a lady comes and picks it up
27:38 - and he asks her to pay for it.
27:40 - And she's like, "You just
threw it in the garbage."
27:42 - or whatever and she's like, "I saw you,
27:43 - "took you only one minute."
27:45 - He said, "No it took me like 15 years."
27:47 - - Right, right, exactly exactly.
27:48 - So my condensed answer to this is always,
27:53 - I have kind of a process
that I guess I teach
27:56 - where the first step is I
call it Socratic questioning,
27:59 - but it's basically just a way
to find out why are you here?
28:02 - So peel back the layers.
28:03 - So they come to you and they
say they need a website built.
28:05 - All right, well, why do you
need this website built?
28:07 - Well the old website is not working,
28:10 - so they're firing the old website.
28:11 - Well, why are they firing,
like what specifically
28:13 - is making it not work and
what led them to this point
28:16 - where they woke up today and reached out
28:17 - to somebody like me?
28:19 - So try to figure out exactly
what is the business case
28:21 - behind what they're bringing to the table.
28:23 - 'Cause they're typically not bringing,
28:24 - unless they're coming
to you as a consultant,
28:25 - they're coming and saying
I need a new website built
28:27 - or I need an app built
or something like that.
28:29 - So if you can figure out why.
28:30 - And then I move into trying
to, what I call quantifying
28:33 - the financial upside,
which is all right so,
28:36 - if this does change, what
affect with this have
28:40 - on your business?
28:41 - So the example I like
to give is there was a,
28:44 - I'm probably gonna struggle
with some of the numbers,
28:46 - 'cause it was a while back,
28:47 - but basically I had a
student of mine who ended
28:50 - up selling a redesign for a rehab clinic.
28:53 - - Okay.
- Right?
28:54 - So he was thinking all
right so I'm gonna sell them
28:58 - on a new website for this clinic.
29:00 - - Designer or?
29:02 - - Designer developer.
29:03 - I think he was using an off shelf template
29:05 - and just coding it all in
Wordpress or something.
29:07 - - Got it.
29:08 - - So what he did was he worked with them
29:10 - and started with, so tell
me about your business.
29:13 - All right, you get people come
in for drug rehabilitation
29:16 - and so on, what is the
value of a patient for you?
29:20 - So if you get a new, somebody
checks themselves in,
29:23 - what's that worth?
29:24 - And it was something like $30,000, right?
29:26 - - Okay, yeah.
29:26 - - So then he kinda
worked backward and said,
29:28 - "Well, I can't affect that.
29:30 - "I can't help them with pricing that.
29:32 - "So I need to kinda work
backwards and find out,
29:34 - "where do I find intersection with me?"
29:36 - So then he asked, "All right so how do
29:39 - "you get a new patient?"
29:41 - And they're like, "Well,
you know, people call in
29:43 - "or fill out our contact form."
29:45 - And what he was trying to get at is
29:47 - what percentage of people who do that turn
29:49 - into a patient.
- Yes.
29:50 - - For them it was 10%.
29:51 - - Wow.
29:52 - - So he's like all right, so
a lead is effectively worth
29:54 - three grand, $3,000 for a lead, right?
29:56 - (Qazi whistles)
29:57 - So then he drilled even
further and he basically said,
29:59 - "So if the job of the website
is not just to be a website
30:03 - "it's to generate leads that
turn into $3,000 contacts, yeah
30:07 - "that's my goal here, right?
30:09 - "Is to help you, if I could
get you one more lead a month,
30:11 - "that's $36,000 net new
revenue over the next year."
30:15 - And he focused on that.
30:16 - - Wow.
- He focused entirely on that.
30:18 - - Wow yes.
30:19 - - So he ended up quoting them 20 grand
30:21 - for a five page website
or something like that.
30:23 - Which seems insane,
- Yep.
30:25 - - But he anchored what
he charged against that
30:30 - and he wasn't selling a five page website,
30:32 - he was selling $3,000 a
month in net new revenue.
30:36 - - Yes, yeah.
- Right?
30:37 - So I know a lot of people
hear that especially,
30:39 - developer types, they're
like, "Oh that's cheating,
30:41 - "that's bullshit, blah blah blah."
30:42 - But at the end of the
day that's what people,
30:44 - that's what, the job of the website is not
30:46 - just to throw another skin on something.
30:48 - It's to say, they want a new
website because they're hoping
30:51 - the website will get them more patients.
30:52 - - Yep.
30:53 - - So if I can figure out
how that deal flow works,
30:55 - I can then sell to that
and say, my job isn't
30:59 - to build you a new website, my
job is to get you more leads.
31:01 - - Wow.
- You know, and focus on that.
31:03 - - Yep.
31:04 - - And that's what he ended up doing
31:05 - and that's why everyone else
quoting much lower prices.
31:08 - Like the guy, it's funny,
31:10 - I gave that story a lot and years ago
31:12 - I was doing my first video course
31:14 - and I just posted on Facebook like,
31:16 - hey, I'm looking to do
like a four or five hour
31:19 - video course, anyone local,
do you know anyone local
31:23 - who does video editing and stuff
31:24 - and can come in and film it?
31:26 - I got all these local people
who full time day jobs
31:28 - and stuff, they're like
yeah, I can edit stuff,
31:30 - I charge like 30 bucks an hour to edit
31:32 - or whatever else.
31:33 - And I was talking to all of them.
31:34 - And then I had a student of mine
31:35 - who had heard that I was
looking to do a video course,
31:37 - 'cause I was tweeting it.
31:39 - And he's like, "Hey, I
want to come in and direct
31:42 - "your next video course
and I wanna tell you
31:44 - "when you're going off on a tangent--"
31:46 - - Wow.
31:47 - - "And when you're screwing
up and all this stuff.
31:48 - "My goal is to help you
make it so your students
31:50 - "are like, this was bad-ass
and I'm gonna tell everyone
31:53 - "I can about this.
31:54 - "And that we're gonna put
together a bad-ass trailer
31:57 - "and it's gonna be like
you're gonna get more sales
31:59 - "and you're gonna get more
referrals and this and that."
32:02 - And I was like this guy's
speaking my language.
32:03 - - Wow. I love that, yes.
- This is what I wanna hear.
32:05 - And I paid him $22,000
32:07 - (Qazi whistling)
for a video course,
32:09 - which at 30 an hour for
however many hours of editing
32:12 - would have been a lot cheaper,
32:13 - had I just said, I need
somebody to come in
32:16 - and just sit in front of me with a camera
32:17 - and then go to Premier
and edit it for a bunch,
32:21 - you know whatever.
32:22 - With him, he's saying,
yeah, I'm doing all that,
32:25 - but my job is to help you
make an amazing product.
32:29 - - Wow.
- Not just edit video.
32:30 - So I think that's an example of where,
32:33 - that's what I wanna hear,
'cause to me he's low risk.
32:36 - I don't need to worry that I'm gonna make
32:37 - a stupid video course that
doesn't make any sense to people.
32:40 - And I go and I ramble and this and that.
32:43 - He's like, "I wanna
keep you from yourself.
32:46 - "Protect you from yourself by making sure
32:48 - "you build the right thing."
32:49 - And I paid him, I didn't even flinch.
32:51 - It was like this--
- That's incredible.
32:53 - - You know he knew, he's like,
"So what are you gonna be
32:55 - "charging for the course?"
32:56 - And I told him and he's like,
"All right, so you only need
32:58 - "like 40 new sales to
make this worth while."
33:01 - - Yes.
33:02 - That makes it really simple for--
33:03 - - Yeah, right, exactly, yeah.
33:05 - - And now you are, you are a founder
33:09 - of a SaaS company.
- Yes.
33:11 - - So now this is something
that a lot of developers
33:15 - wanna be able to do, it's their dream
33:17 - to be able to build their own
software as a service company,
33:20 - build their own product and
be able to actually sell it.
33:23 - So, this must be like one
really amazing experience
33:27 - for you to actually build it out.
33:29 - But how did you build it and
how do you market this now?
33:36 - - Yeah, it's a good question,
33:37 - so the SaaS is called RightMessage,
33:39 - which is just website personalization
33:40 - and conversion software.
33:42 - But what's interesting about the backstory
33:44 - is remember I'd mentioned
I build in e-public,
33:47 - I learn in public.
33:48 - So I was learning about, at
the time I was using Drip.
33:50 - I was learning about
what I could do with it
33:52 - for email marketing and so on.
33:54 - I'm using ConvertKit now,
but that's a different story.
33:57 - But what I did was I didn't
say I wanna build software.
34:00 - I was doing it for myself with custom code
34:03 - on my own site.
34:04 - It was kinda working, right?
34:06 - I was tweeting about it, I
was sharing it on public,
34:08 - in blog posts and so on, talking about it
34:10 - with friends of mine
and so on and so forth.
34:13 - Eventually that got some companies saying,
34:16 - "Hey I'd love to talk to you
about doing that for us."
34:18 - So I mentioned I don't
do consulting anymore,
34:20 - but I was, a few years
back, doing consulting
34:22 - on a limited scale to say I
wanna see if what worked for me,
34:25 - worked for others.
34:26 - The stuff that I covered like today.
34:29 - So I had about 10 clients over the span
34:31 - of about a year and a
half who I did this with.
34:33 - I individually sold them
on personalization, right?
34:38 - I sold them on that.
34:40 - That led to a video course that I did.
34:42 - So I got people who were
seeing that I was doing this,
34:45 - and they were like, "Can't
afford you as a consultant,
34:47 - "but can we, do you have any thoughts
34:50 - "about teaching me how to
do this kind of stuff?"
34:52 - So I did a video course
called "Mastering Drip",
34:54 - which is on automation personalization.
34:56 - - I have that course actually.
34:57 - - Yep, so I did that, right?
34:59 - And then from that, the
biggest complaint there was,
35:04 - all right I get all
this, but I'm a marketer
35:07 - and how do I, you gave
me some sample code,
35:10 - but what do I do with
this sample code, right?
35:12 - - Yeah.
35:13 - - So that's like RightMessage
or my software product
35:16 - didn't come out of a vacuum.
35:17 - Instead it came from
doing a lot of consulting
35:19 - around the same problem
where I was selling it
35:21 - in a high touch way, and
then I moved low touch
35:24 - with the video course,
where now I'm selling
35:26 - the same outcome or similar outcome,
35:29 - learn it versus I'll do it for you.
35:31 - But, I did that a bunch of times
35:33 - and sold a few hundred copies of that.
35:35 - And that finally gave me the confidence
35:38 - to say it is worthwhile
building up a team,
35:41 - writing a lot of code and making it so,
35:43 - like I would not have,
'cause the mistake I made was
35:45 - I had a SaaS before this,
that I started in 2011
35:48 - called Planscope which is
a project management tool.
35:50 - - Mm got it.
35:51 - - That was built for
freelancers and agencies
35:53 - because I ran an agency and
I hated the tools I used.
35:56 - So I did what most agency
owners eventually do
35:58 - and they write their own, right tool.
36:01 - But I jumped straight into software
36:03 - and didn't think about how I'd sell it.
36:05 - And it just petered
along and never did well.
36:07 - I think at the most it did
I think four or $5,000 net
36:10 - in revenue, but that was,
it took, I sold it in 2016.
36:15 - But I started in 2011, and
five years in it was only
36:18 - doing like four or five grand a month.
36:21 - - Wow.
- So
36:23 - the mistake I made there
was I wasn't focused,
36:26 - with what I'm doing now,
I focused on selling
36:29 - in a high priced consulting engagement,
36:32 - the same outcome that my
$79 a month SaaS delivers.
36:37 - - Wow.
- It's the same outcome.
36:39 - I was selling it in a very,
I'll do it all for you,
36:44 - I'm a consultant, I'll do it for you.
36:45 - I'll write the code, I'll think through
36:46 - your segmentation all this stuff.
36:48 - And then I shifted to I'll teach you
36:50 - how to do this yourself,
'cause I have experience.
36:52 - - Yeah.
36:53 - - I've done this for 10
different companies now.
36:54 - I've been around the block in that sense,
36:56 - and I can teach you how you
should do this yourself.
36:59 - And then it turned into
I wanna build software
37:02 - that will do this with you.
37:04 - - Got it, wow.
37:05 - - So kinda cover that full spectrum.
37:07 - - Okay, that's incredible.
37:10 - So basically we went from like beginner
37:13 - where they should invest their time.
37:14 - So if you're a complete beginner,
37:16 - like actually start off
maybe doing business stuff,
37:20 - learning about local businesses
37:22 - and focusing even on
earning the income first
37:27 - and figuring out those skills
37:28 - and then jumping deeper and deeper
37:30 - into more technical coding.
37:32 - In order to be able to
increase your income,
37:35 - to be able to charge a higher price
37:36 - you have to come off as investment,
37:39 - you have to be an investment.
37:40 - There should be an ROI on you.
37:43 - And not focusing so
much on our own features
37:46 - and like what kind of
tools, bells and whistles
37:48 - we can provide.
37:50 - And we even touched
base on building a SaaS
37:53 - or being able to market it.
37:54 - Which I think for most
people that's something
37:57 - they aspire to do eventually.
37:59 - I mean I know we have a few people
38:01 - who actually have a SaaS.
- Yep, awesome, cool.
38:03 - - Who are doing really great with it.
38:05 - But that's a lot fewer of the people,
38:08 - but that's just something
that I think a lot
38:10 - of developers wanna think about.
38:12 - And I think if they can
think of it in terms
38:14 - of how can we provide value
and reverse engineer it
38:17 - like you did, I think
then it's much more likely
38:20 - to be successful.
38:21 - You know I think that's why
ConvertKit has been successful
38:24 - and they're doing $16 million a year.
38:26 - And I think that's why
RightMessage is getting so much.
38:31 - I think a lot of people are jumping on it
38:33 - because you're providing a lot of value
38:36 - and there's a lot of
human touch in there too.
38:38 - - Right.
- Right?
38:39 - Like you are personally jumping in
38:41 - and helping a lot of people.
38:42 - I think that's what
ConvertKit did really well.
38:43 - - It did, early on.
38:44 - It won't be a long term
thing, but it needs to,
38:47 - you need to do the
things that don't scale.
38:48 - Paul Graham says, "Do the
things that don't scale first."
38:51 - Which is what you should be doing.
38:52 - - Yep, and even Gary V. says that,
38:54 - he says, "Scale the unscalable."
38:56 - - Yeah.
- Actually a lot.
38:57 - So I think that is really important.
39:00 - I think developers sometimes
even try to run away
39:03 - from human stuff.
39:05 - - Well people wanna have the little,
39:07 - they wanna have their app that they built.
39:08 - - Yeah.
39:09 - - With a little signup page,
39:11 - and they wanna just wake up
and have people paying for it
39:14 - that are paying so they
could jus code on it all day.
39:16 - - Yes.
39:17 - - And they don't wanna talk to anyone.
39:18 - And unfortunately, if
you wanna do it right,
39:21 - you need to start with this dialogue
39:23 - before you can turn it into a monologue.
39:25 - - Yep.
- And that's a safer approach.
39:27 - I was your quintessential
typical developer
39:30 - who was like, I wanna
get out of consulting,
39:32 - I'm sit of clients, I
wanna just build an app
39:34 - and I just wanna sit back
and code on my app all day,
39:36 - and get to play with cool frameworks.
39:38 - And that's why that business
kinda failed. (laughs)
39:42 - - Yeah, so I love that, and
this is much more of a risk free
39:47 - approach 'cause you're building things,
39:49 - you're reverse engineering.
39:51 - You kinda know it's gonna
be profitable or successful
39:54 - before you even do it, but
it's not a quick thing,
39:57 - it does take a long time
so I think that developing
40:01 - your skills as a developer,
being in the market
40:03 - for a while, being a
consultant and really getting
40:06 - those skills down and then
eventually building a, you know.
40:10 - And multiple software as
service type of businesses
40:13 - to finally get to the
point where you are at.
40:16 - - Absolutely.
40:16 - - So thank you so much
