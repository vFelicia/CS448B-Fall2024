00:05 - yo let's go guys i'm so excited to be
00:07 - here
00:08 - welcome to an amazing amazing day
00:12 - but we're gonna be talking about react
00:14 - native
00:16 - that's it react native
00:20 - react native guys you know we all love
00:23 - react people come to love reacting to
00:25 - the channel but we want to take it a
00:27 - step further and show you guys
00:29 - if you want to build an ios app and
00:30 - android app we're going to show you
00:32 - how to do that today and the fun part is
00:34 - is that we haven't prepared so it's
00:36 - going to be very unscripted and we're
00:37 - very
00:38 - you know we're going to keep it real
00:39 - with you guys we're going to be going
00:40 - through this together
00:41 - exploring this together building this
00:44 - app out together it's gonna be fun dude
00:46 - it's gonna be super fun and for this one
00:48 - i'm actually really really excited
00:50 - because not gonna lie for some of the
00:52 - other ones that are over prepared
00:53 - sometimes it's boring going through
00:55 - those because
00:56 - we kind of already know what's going to
00:57 - happen the interaction part is fun
00:59 - but uh interacting with everybody but
01:01 - like this is
01:02 - personally exciting for me sunny because
01:05 - i get to learn in this
01:07 - and i actually want to learn react
01:08 - native
01:10 - exactly dude exactly and the thing is i
01:12 - coded react native quite heavily about
01:15 - two years ago so even i'm a bit rusty
01:17 - with it but
01:18 - i built some crazy stuff with react
01:20 - native so i'm excited to jump back into
01:22 - that i'm excited to go ahead and
01:23 - get kazzy involved in this stuff and
01:25 - just get stronger in this so we can all
01:27 - go ahead and build some crazy apps
01:29 - together
01:29 - but um yeah this is the start of a huge
01:32 - series
01:35 - were you doing um when you said you were
01:37 - building stuff with it were you doing
01:38 - stuff with tipple
01:40 - no so tipple it wasn't it wasn't for tip
01:42 - wheels for a company i worked at
01:45 - um i had never could have react native
01:48 - before
01:48 - i was a full stack developer at the time
01:50 - so i just done react
01:51 - and it was in the deep end i hadn't done
01:53 - redux either so it was redux
01:55 - and react native in one so i just had to
01:57 - like just thrown in the deep end just
01:59 - catch a wave as it was running so but um
02:01 - yeah if
02:02 - if i could do it in that situation guys
02:04 - we're gonna break it down to a point
02:05 - where you don't have to know how to put
02:06 - back pretty much code gonna make it
02:08 - super easy for you guys to go ahead
02:10 - and understand that oh first donation yo
02:12 - what's up bro we're up to 456 concurrent
02:16 - viewers and actually my stream deck is

04:13 - people are like kazzy speak in hindi
04:19 - we should start doing that
04:23 - all right guys let's go
04:26 - all right so where do we get started
04:28 - sonny should i click get started
04:30 - is that the first step yeah let's just
04:32 - do it together dude so let's click on
04:33 - get started
04:35 - all right and i've done a bit of uh like
04:37 - a run through roughly earlier so because
04:39 - there are things like
04:41 - uh one thing to know is if you're using
04:44 - a mac it's a lot easier you're going to
04:46 - probably need a mac when you're doing
04:47 - this
04:47 - everything's easier with mac and also
04:49 - download uh xcode right
04:52 - yeah so download xcodes xcode's for free
04:54 - it's in the app store
04:55 - all you need to do is go ahead and
04:56 - download that you're going to need the
04:58 - developer tools that get installed
05:00 - when you set up xcode so that's pretty
05:02 - much that um
05:04 - you might also see this thing called
05:05 - expo so like
05:07 - this little coding box has like expo on
05:09 - the top right yeah
05:10 - now we're going to cover that at another
05:12 - point but we're going to be doing it all
05:14 - through the
05:14 - sort of the raw installation way but
05:17 - we're going to go through export on
05:18 - another day
05:19 - and show you how you can actually get up
05:20 - and running really quickly with expo
05:22 - cause that's really cool dude expo i
05:24 - would say that anybody who
05:26 - is gonna have trouble installing stuff
05:28 - if you wanna follow us along you can
05:29 - even
05:30 - follow us along and do stuff right here
05:32 - on expo that way you can't possibly
05:35 - up like
05:36 - your installation is not going to
05:37 - especially if you're on windows or
05:38 - something like
05:40 - that's going to matter yeah because you
05:42 - know when i was coding before they
05:43 - didn't uh when i was doing
05:45 - it they didn't have expo so a lot of
05:47 - people who are hitting windows were
05:48 - getting kind of hit or miss but
05:50 - that's true dude so anyone who who can't
05:52 - install it or runs into any issues
05:54 - go ahead and try it out with experts bro
05:57 - we're
05:57 - we're at 620 bro
06:01 - that's what i'm talking about dude over
06:03 - 500 likes

06:24 - nice dude hey let me quickly find the
06:28 - the next step because um where is it
06:31 - going
06:32 - react let's go ahead and do react native
06:35 - installation
06:39 - so development environments hang up
06:41 - development environment okay here we go
06:43 - so
06:54 - i'm just waiting oh i just changed
06:56 - the text bro
06:58 - i just typed in yo here all right let's

08:22 - there we go uh facebook guy says
08:26 - um sonny and kazi you guys are super
08:28 - exceptional i'm currently on the
08:30 - amazon clone with react.js and
08:33 - getting it complete well with me as a
08:37 - complete beginner on the web development
08:38 - space
08:38 - okay i will be finishing soon and
08:40 - proceed to the netflix and others i'm
08:42 - martin from ghana yo
08:43 - that is epic brother hello what's up
08:45 - mine
08:46 - that's awesome man i love the fact that
08:48 - so many of you now have gone through the
08:50 - amazon clone
08:51 - so like it really really awesome to see
08:53 - that and i see so many little tweaks and
08:54 - changes that each
08:55 - like each of you have made really really
08:57 - cool to see
08:59 - um all right so here i opened it up
09:02 - right
09:03 - so so if you go down so there's two
09:05 - options when you use a react material
09:07 - about right so firstly
09:08 - any of you who don't know what react
09:09 - native is it's basically
09:12 - using react so you have html css
09:14 - javascript react is like a
09:15 - imagine reactive there's a big circle
09:17 - around those three things allows us to
09:19 - build really powerful apps right
09:21 - then react native once you know how to
09:23 - code and react
09:24 - so if you've done anything in react
09:26 - before every single piece of knowledge
09:29 - that you know from
09:30 - react is applicable here right so you
09:32 - can pretty much
09:33 - go ahead and take that knowledge to
09:35 - react native and then you can pretty
09:36 - much build ios and android apps
09:38 - so if we go down to uh click on react
09:41 - native cli
09:42 - quick start all right and then i'm just
09:45 - signifying that react is pretty much
09:47 - like applies all react knowledge applies
09:50 - to react native
09:51 - my face is hiding exactly so let me move
09:53 - my face and back
09:55 - all right here we go every bit of
09:57 - knowledge that you know from react is
09:59 - actually all
10:00 - transferable over assassin react hooks
10:02 - all that fun stuff pretty much take it
10:04 - all over with you
10:05 - um so now what we want to do is if let's
10:07 - go down to
10:09 - the base so you see where it says it
10:10 - says xcode
10:12 - and um you're on the right page right
10:17 - getting started page right that's the
10:18 - one you sent me or yeah this one
10:21 - yeah so if you go down to installing
10:23 - dependencies
10:25 - um okay installing
10:28 - depend i literally i'm command
10:31 - i think i sent you one um oh you gotta
10:33 - click on
10:34 - you see where it says react native cli
10:37 - quick stop
10:38 - yeah that's the one you go click on that
10:41 - there we go
10:42 - then scroll down right so
10:46 - now what we need to do is we need to
10:48 - install a few things so the first
10:49 - thing is is you have to install
10:52 - something called homebrew
10:54 - okay so if you don't already have
10:57 - homebrew there's a little link you can
10:59 - click on that
11:00 - and it will show you how to install
11:01 - homebrew but
11:03 - what we can do next once we have
11:05 - homebrew installed
11:07 - you'd have to do brew install node and
11:09 - that's going to install something called
11:10 - node.js
11:11 - on your machine and then brew install
11:13 - watchman so we need should i do
11:15 - node or do i already have node
11:18 - um you should already have node if this
11:20 - isn't a new computer right
11:23 - i have no idea when was the last time i
11:25 - used this computer it was a while ago
11:27 - okay so to test it uh firstly make it
11:30 - super big
11:31 - your your terminal so we cannot we can
11:33 - all see that okay so come on
11:35 - one plus yeah there we go because i'm on
11:37 - an
11:38 - tv it's actually like massive now for me
11:41 - in person
11:43 - like tournament like literally bigger
11:44 - than my face
11:46 - it's like bigger than my chest and my
11:48 - head
11:49 - oh no oh nice i've got a reference over
11:51 - here yeah i can see that
11:52 - nice so now what we're going to do is
11:54 - type in node dash dash
11:56 - v let me try i think there's no dash
11:58 - dash v uh no
11:59 - no dash v yeah no dash v i have node bro
12:03 - i just typed in node and it
12:05 - showed me whatever you have no right
12:06 - that's perfect we don't need to install
12:08 - node but what you might need to do is
12:09 - type in brew install watchman
12:14 - dude i watched this clip on dr manhattan
12:18 - from watchmen
12:19 - yeah on youtube and it's have
12:21 - you ever watched uh watchmen the movie
12:24 - ages ago i can't remember it but i
12:25 - remember it was a decent film
12:27 - the blue dude is like he's like a god or
12:29 - something right
12:30 - yeah pretty sick
12:34 - so dude i got my cup of coffee man i'm
12:38 - i'm feeling good bro exactly dude
12:41 - that's it i'm gonna get back into this
12:44 - all right so
12:44 - we once it does so homebrew can
12:47 - sometimes take a while
12:49 - to set everything up and do its thing
12:51 - but if we go
12:52 - down to you know where it says xcode and
12:54 - cocoapods
12:56 - so xcode is is basically how you would
12:59 - build an ios app right so if you're
13:01 - writing oh my god
13:03 - damn holy bro what is happening
13:07 - nawazuddin air horn for him
13:10 - and he goes just in time
13:14 - like a compiler for what i needed and
13:17 - wanted to do buddy
13:18 - sonny and kazzy you all are an
13:20 - inspiration make that code available
13:22 - somewhere later please all right brother
13:23 - you got it
13:24 - you go i did yo we already crossed

13:52 - view of it
13:53 - we should make that with the react
13:55 - native yeah we should
13:57 - 100 and then we can actually put it in
13:59 - the app store or whatever and let
14:01 - students go there and give it a like we
14:02 - can actually publish
14:04 - an app with react native in ios and

18:55 - have saved so much time and money spent
18:56 - in college i love y'all's passion i'm
18:58 - grateful for how much motivation you
19:00 - give me
19:01 - as a developer let's get it
19:04 - awesome thank you susannah
19:07 - man i'm just having fun man this is
19:09 - exciting
19:11 - crazy hey david's in the house joseph
19:15 - david in the house let's go dr mert
19:18 - uh joseph goes i've actually applied
19:20 - your react slash
19:21 - bem to my older projects and i've
19:23 - elevated them to a higher level dope
19:25 - dope
19:26 - i love that i remember when we first i
19:28 - got him with batman
19:30 - did you read this comment yeah talk to
19:33 - man
19:33 - in the house hey all right guys cool
19:37 - this is like a donation live stream yeah
19:39 - dude that's exciting
19:40 - man i we gotta get on twitch bro
19:43 - we gotta get on twitch oh
19:45 - twitch oh man guys you have no idea what
19:48 - we have in mind for the live streams and
19:49 - upgrading so
19:51 - yeah gonna get fun all right my hands
19:52 - are itching sonny let's start
19:54 - building some bro
19:56 - let's do it so let's go back to the
19:57 - previous tab all right
19:59 - previous tab i'm there bro right so
20:02 - previous tab and then now we are going
20:06 - to go ahead go down to the bottom where
20:07 - it says
20:08 - xcode and cocoapods
20:13 - xcode and cocoapods got it yeah
20:16 - so this is where you would have to go
20:18 - ahead and install like
20:20 - xcode so just basically the easy way
20:21 - around this is download xcode setup and
20:24 - you should be good to go right
20:26 - the next one is if you go down a little
20:28 - bit lower
20:29 - so sudo gem install cocoapods so you're
20:31 - gonna have to do this one
20:33 - now guys the this the reason why there's
20:35 - a lot of setup here is because you set
20:37 - things up once properly
20:38 - and then you pretty much can build apps
20:40 - and just and and build that ship across
20:42 - ios and android so
20:44 - it does take a little bit more setup
20:45 - because you're actually building full-on
20:47 - apps
20:48 - right so you're going to build fully
20:49 - functional apps which can go on the app
20:50 - store the android play store
20:52 - all that stuff so you're going to need
20:54 - to set things up
20:55 - once and for all to get that up and
20:56 - running um
20:59 - okay so and the chances are there's a
21:01 - lot more sort of like
21:02 - teething issues that you do face with
21:04 - react native so you just have to have a
21:06 - little bit of patience when it comes to
21:07 - that stuff but
21:09 - again it should be all good and uh and
21:11 - once you guys get used to that and trust
21:13 - me the trade-off is so small
21:15 - like imagine coding an entire app in ios
21:18 - and then you have to do the same thing
21:19 - in android
21:20 - make sure it's consistent like the
21:22 - trade-off is is nothing when you do
21:24 - react native you write code once
21:26 - and it's good to go so for those of you
21:28 - on windows that can't do this
21:29 - use something called expo um yeah so i
21:32 - saw some comments coming in yeah expo
21:34 - you will not be
21:35 - go you will not go wrong you will still
21:37 - build actual apps
21:38 - and you will be fine and then on the
21:41 - back
21:42 - keep working on the process to actually
21:43 - install on your computer and get it
21:45 - working
21:45 - but i wouldn't like i wouldn't put the
21:48 - process of installation over your skill
21:50 - of learning react native so if it's
21:52 - getting literally getting in your way
21:54 - then just go and start learning it using
21:55 - expo
21:57 - yeah and i would even say like even if
21:59 - you did set up react native
22:01 - like expo is actually a very good tool
22:03 - like it's a very quick tool you can use
22:05 - you can quickly get started with it so
22:07 - there is no harm in using escrow and
22:10 - thank you nitish kumar for another
22:11 - donation
22:12 - appreciate that dude thank you all right
22:15 - i love coding with your videos and never
22:17 - get bored you guys help me a lot
22:18 - okay dope nice
22:21 - the next step is creating a new
22:24 - application so
22:26 - um oh we're still installing yeah so
22:27 - this this stuff takes a while
22:29 - for the initial installation but once
22:31 - we've done that
22:32 - what we're going to do so previously we
22:35 - did something called create react app
22:37 - right
22:37 - create react app used to kind of get
22:39 - that little spinny react icon up and
22:41 - running
22:41 - and everything sort of pretty much
22:43 - started from that point
22:45 - with with this we use mpx react native
22:48 - and then it has a command called init
22:49 - and then you pretty much give whatever
22:52 - you want to give it now
22:53 - there are templates right so so you can
22:56 - you can use like
22:57 - the the sort of the quick start guide so
22:59 - cause you just go on to that tab and
23:00 - scroll a little bit down so
23:02 - they can see what they're they can see
23:04 - what i'm i'm talking about as we do it
23:09 - oh there we go all right go to this tab
23:12 - here
23:13 - yeah so go down no to the the tab that
23:15 - you were just on
23:17 - previously and let's go down to
23:21 - uh creating a new app but let's just go
23:22 - yeah there we go that's good
23:24 - so you can see the top the top command
23:26 - is the one that we're gonna
23:28 - run once everything's installed that's
23:30 - gonna pretty much set up our starter
23:31 - point so that's our starter template
23:33 - which gets like an app
23:34 - ready it's going to go ahead and when we
23:36 - run npm run ios it's going to start up
23:38 - an iphone simulator
23:39 - get everything running on on that app
23:42 - but you can also
23:43 - use a template right so if you if any of
23:46 - you have watched the videos on the
23:47 - channel where we do redux
23:49 - and things like that we're using create
23:50 - react app but we're using a template and
23:52 - we're using the redox template
23:53 - in this case they show you a
23:54 - demonstration of a typescript template
23:57 - um that you can go ahead and get started
23:59 - with but in this case we're pretty much
24:01 - just going to be doing the bare bones
24:02 - we're not going to be doing typescript
24:03 - and stuff today
24:04 - i'm just going to go ahead and show you
24:07 - um
24:07 - yeah so show you how we get started but
24:10 - because we want this installed all we
24:12 - need to do is run that command mpx react
24:14 - native
24:14 - init and then we call it a name whatever
24:16 - we need all right there we go
24:18 - so let's um
24:21 - yep all right and what i will do
24:24 - is i will make one for react native
24:29 - command k by the way shortcut for wiping
24:33 - oh oh yeah yeah
24:39 - somebody said kotlin is better no dude
24:45 - i mean um what do you think about
24:48 - flutter
24:49 - and then swift and then react native how
24:51 - do you think about those three
24:54 - so so firstly kotlin isn't isn't bad i
24:57 - i cutlin is really good but um so
25:00 - flutter flutter is actually very
25:01 - promising
25:02 - um it's very promising it's quite on
25:05 - it's coming up quite a lot it's very
25:06 - performant
25:07 - the only thing is is it's kind of it has
25:10 - much more like much less
25:11 - fuel so like less less support than
25:13 - things like react native
25:15 - things that have been out for a lot
25:16 - longer um there are some awesome
25:18 - tutorials out there for flower and
25:20 - things like that
25:20 - but i found running intellect when you
25:23 - get into bespoke situations and there's
25:25 - not
25:25 - a lot of community behind it you're kind
25:28 - of on your own so if you get stuck in
25:30 - something
25:30 - completely new territory uh you're
25:33 - you're really in the dirt by yourself
25:35 - which is why
25:36 - it's very tricky when you start getting
25:37 - into very powerful sort of performant
25:39 - apps
25:40 - surface level apps lotto is very
25:42 - powerful at the moment unless you get
25:43 - very very good at using things like dot
25:45 - the dart programming language
25:47 - um swift is very powerful
25:51 - but the benefit guys is if you code in
25:53 - react native it compiles down to swift
25:56 - so you get swift codes and so you pretty
25:58 - much conclude in javascript
26:00 - but you your compiled code ends up
26:02 - becoming swift so that's very good
26:04 - um and then the last one you said what
26:06 - was that so you had fl
26:07 - flutter so there was flutter then there
26:10 - was swift
26:11 - and then there was react native yeah so
26:14 - react native yeah like
26:15 - i am a big fan of react native reason
26:17 - being guys you can code react for web
26:20 - apps
26:20 - react native or ios android you can even
26:24 - use
26:24 - a a different variant of react native
26:28 - for uh building desks because you don't
26:30 - have to go into a whole new world right
26:32 - like i
26:32 - i would much rather go from react to
26:34 - react native than react to
26:37 - flutter yeah because that's a whole new
26:40 - ecosystem
26:41 - and i was learning flutter and i was
26:42 - actually having a lot of fun but it's a
26:44 - whole new ecosystem that i had to pick
26:45 - up and
26:46 - i'd much rather stay within a similar
26:48 - ecosystem and that way i could just
26:50 - keep building on the expertise i have
26:52 - rather than keep unlearning and
26:53 - relearning things
26:55 - exactly and in case of the time that
26:57 - you're putting towards things like if
26:59 - you put
26:59 - what time towards improving javascript
27:02 - now you're gonna get better and react in
27:04 - electron and react native and all these
27:07 - other areas
27:08 - whereas if you can prove your code in
27:09 - flutter you're you're very limited to
27:11 - just flutter like
27:12 - that how much time did a developer spend
27:15 - to do this
27:17 - dude i always wonder i'm like some guy
27:21 - you know come online i know why this
27:23 - happens
27:25 - this is probably like somebody who was
27:26 - procrastinating from doing
27:28 - actual work on the yeah
27:31 - the actual library firebase that's a
27:34 - cool one as well they have a cool one
27:36 - when they do it
27:37 - damn no it starts glowing up with 5a
27:40 - stuff
27:41 - yeah okay it's down so the template now
27:43 - yeah that one's going to download the
27:45 - template everything's up
27:46 - um it has a v so let's explain kind of a
27:50 - breakdown as to like
27:52 - reactive and how it works so there's a
27:54 - so many
27:55 - similarities with react native and react
27:57 - so if we go back to the first tab while
27:59 - this installs
28:01 - we can actually go ahead and show them
28:02 - some of that code in an expo and we kind
28:04 - of play around with that code
28:06 - sure um while we wait yeah i wanna
28:08 - actually keep playing on expo that
28:10 - sounds fun
28:11 - because i was yeah i was even doing some
28:13 - of the flutter stuff i mean
28:14 - one thing annoying about these online
28:16 - ids is like there's
28:18 - some stuff that's supposed to work that
28:19 - just stops working for no reason
28:21 - that kind of starts getting really
28:23 - annoying yeah like isn't they they do
28:26 - so many things well and then they're
28:28 - just really some stuff and the
28:30 - the stuff they're bad at they're just
28:31 - really shy
28:32 - so it makes you not want to use it yeah
28:33 - because you wanted to just be consistent
28:35 - and have a similar
28:36 - feel all the time like when you're
28:38 - coding you don't want it to be like the
28:40 - same exact thing that you did that got
28:42 - you a result now it
28:43 - isn't working and it's their fault on
28:45 - their end it's frustrating
28:47 - exactly so okay i like that it's
28:50 - so here's a cool thing i like about expo
28:52 - you can actually scan this
28:55 - and then see it on your on your phone
28:59 - yeah and it's really good for
29:00 - prototyping like imagine guys you were
29:02 - you were sort of you brought a quick
29:04 - sort of like
29:05 - uh a demonstration for a client or like
29:07 - somebody like for a job interview
29:09 - now imagine you were like yeah i built
29:11 - the app and also
29:13 - why don't you go ahead and test it out
29:14 - on your phone they'll be like oh
29:16 - like this guy actually went ahead and
29:18 - and built this thing and
29:19 - i can actually play with it and when
29:21 - people can play with something
29:22 - and not just click around but actually
29:24 - swipe through your app and mess around
29:26 - on it
29:26 - that's pretty cool like that and this is
29:28 - what you can do with expo
29:30 - yeah let me hit tab to play
29:33 - what is this device tab to play whoa
29:37 - data 45 finance oh
29:42 - donation would love an example using
29:44 - finance charts in react native
29:47 - like candlesticks etc yeah
29:50 - that's actually i did i have done a
29:52 - stock trading app uh
29:54 - build for a client once in react i was
29:56 - using i think it's called d3
29:58 - for number crunching damn that's sick
30:01 - yeah
30:02 - d3 right yeah so i did it for it was for
30:04 - like a a trading sort of app that he
30:06 - wanted to get like collect
30:08 - loads of stuff in real time and i paired
30:10 - that with firebase and he did a bunch of
30:11 - cool
30:12 - um but yeah i mean we could definitely
30:14 - go ahead and have a look at that yeah
30:16 - all right here we go we got yo what is
30:20 - happening whoa whoa
30:23 - whoa whoa there we go so oh it's
30:27 - interesting it doesn't even need to be a
30:28 - string
30:30 - yeah it's kind of so those so that
30:32 - doesn't need to actually be a string
30:34 - that one yeah
30:36 - because it's actually putting the quotes
30:37 - i see
30:39 - yeah because okay it's adding the quotes
30:41 - itself
30:42 - yeah yeah yeah i understand sure
30:45 - yeah so now um so the way to
30:48 - think about it is there's slight
30:49 - differences where the react may even
30:50 - react right
30:52 - one is there's some core components that
30:54 - you need to think about and that's like
30:56 - views scrollable um i think they're
30:59 - called
31:00 - i can't remember off the top of my head
31:01 - but we'll get into it and all that stuff
31:03 - but there's like
31:04 - uh safe scrolling zones so that way you
31:07 - don't hit the the little notch
31:08 - on special iphones or androids and all
31:11 - that stuff there's um
31:13 - but the main thing is you have these
31:14 - different views so you can see like here
31:17 - rather than a div
31:18 - think of a div as a view that's the only
31:21 - thing you're switching in react
31:22 - right so rather than a div you now have
31:24 - view and then you import the view from
31:26 - react native and now what that does
31:28 - is on the web div is just stands for
31:31 - container right
31:32 - so it just stands for container um but
31:35 - in the in
31:36 - in this case a view goes ahead and when
31:39 - you open this up on ios app the code it
31:41 - compiles down to is
31:42 - is the native component for a ios phone
31:46 - so like so whatever a view is on an ios
31:48 - phone it's going to pretty much go ahead
31:49 - and compare to that
31:50 - wherever it is on an android phone
31:51 - you'll compare to that the same thing
31:53 - applies to text
31:55 - so on a website that your text would be
31:58 - a h1 h2 h2h3
31:59 - ptag and things like that on this it
32:02 - would just be text
32:03 - and then you pretty much style it up
32:05 - style it as you want you can change the
32:07 - fonts and things like that and there are
32:09 - really clean nice ways that you can go
32:10 - ahead and modify all this stuff but
32:12 - we'll get into that afterwards
32:14 - um yeah but let's quickly see
32:19 - so is that uh is that installation done
32:23 - oh yeah most likely
32:28 - wait okay so it says failed to install
32:32 - cocoapods which is required okay so
32:34 - yeah so try and grab that so this
32:36 - happened to me as well actually
32:38 - um cocoapods are basically the ios
32:41 - dependencies
32:42 - so in this case it's failed to install
32:44 - the ios part of the app
32:46 - uh it's a bit of a pain in the ass like
32:48 - sometimes all of this stuff but
32:50 - it's all good so now saying missing
32:52 - script is too old
32:54 - warning let's have a look iphones
32:57 - right so kazi you want to go ahead and
32:58 - open up xcode
33:02 - so let's go ahead and open up xcode
33:05 - and then it might need to actually go
33:08 - ahead and say
33:09 - okay so it has installed what we needed
33:12 - um
33:12 - interesting okay so we already did pod
33:15 - install
33:18 - what was that error it came up so it
33:21 - said compile account create
33:30 - just go ahead and and copy that and send
33:32 - it to me on the slack and then i'll
33:34 - read that but in the meantime what we
33:38 - can do
33:39 - is we can cd out of that after
33:42 - you send that nice
33:46 - so you can see uh and
33:50 - let's just go ahead and actually open up
33:52 - the code so we can start having a look
33:53 - at the code as well
33:54 - so you want to go ahead and do dot dot
33:56 - to get back from this
33:59 - so let's open item dot dot
34:03 - and then inside the project that they
34:05 - created you want to do code
34:07 - space so you know that little sort of
34:09 - trick that we do to go ahead and open up
34:11 - vs code
34:17 - yeah okay so you haven't got the the
34:19 - code command so in that case
34:21 - open up vs code
34:25 - and do command shift p
34:32 - and then type in um shell
34:35 - so s-h-e-l-l and then you see where it
34:38 - says install
34:40 - code inside this command from from path
34:42 - yeah just go ahead and
34:44 - install that yeah so that'll be handy
34:45 - for for the future
34:47 - but um and now what you do is you write
34:49 - code dash insiders
34:51 - and then space inside that directory
34:54 - yeah okay let's see
35:00 - here
35:07 - and what um so
35:10 - uh it's a bit hard to see one sec so
35:14 - yeah so now when you're inside of it
35:16 - yeah there we go oh
35:17 - that's cool that's actually pretty cool
35:20 - yeah
35:20 - that's really cool i love that and that
35:23 - opens up everything
35:24 - so it's a very good shortcut when you're
35:26 - coding oh that's
35:28 - sick because i i hate opening things up
35:30 - from vs code itself
35:32 - yeah because it's just so slow otherwise
35:34 - but for those of you who are not using
35:36 - the insider's edition we're using the
35:38 - beta one
35:39 - uh beta version of a vs code that's why
35:41 - it says insiders but you guys would just
35:42 - have
35:43 - code dot and you have to do that command
35:45 - shift p
35:46 - shell trick to go ahead and do that um
35:49 - let's go ahead and see what was
35:51 - the issue with other stuff so the the
35:53 - problem with
35:54 - most likely with the xcode pod stuff was
35:56 - that we haven't installed all of the
35:59 - ios dependencies um which is fine we can
36:02 - go ahead and do that in a sec
36:03 - but for now go ahead and send me a share
36:05 - vs live share
36:06 - we can pretty much jump into the same
36:08 - code base all right
36:18 - okay so dynamite maddie says i have no
36:20 - macbook so how can i work on this
36:22 - use expo so you can definitely go ahead
36:24 - and use expo and that will
36:27 - let you pretty much go ahead and move
36:29 - forward with that
36:38 - um
36:43 - all right here we go about to open it
36:45 - i'll just log into github
36:47 - so then i can do this share read and
36:51 - write
36:52 - and then i will get you the link in a
36:54 - second it's starting the collaboration
36:56 - session
36:57 - so now guys let us know in the comments
37:00 - how many of you guys have done like some
37:02 - kind of app development
37:04 - native ios like ios our android
37:07 - so before i did react native i actually
37:09 - touched on a lot of android stuff
37:11 - uh i wasn't using kotlin so i was using
37:13 - some other stuff
37:14 - so just the pure sort of back you know
37:16 - old-school stuff but
37:18 - definitely would have gone ahead and had
37:20 - a look at um
37:22 - a kotlin if i was doing android
37:23 - development but now you don't even have
37:24 - to do that i would say
37:25 - spend your time go ahead and do it um
37:28 - using this so
37:30 - let's see so man looks at our system
37:33 - fully installed yeah
37:34 - so yeah so the ios sdk isn't fully
37:36 - installed
37:37 - that's clear um just checking how to do
37:40 - that so guys remember
37:41 - all this stuff you don't remember off
37:43 - the top of your head and
37:44 - if somebody says they do they they don't
37:47 - because it's one of those things you've
37:48 - got to get comfortable with
37:50 - you'll fix it and then you'll run into
37:52 - the same issue a year later
37:54 - and then you'll fix it again and then
37:56 - you know you've got
37:57 - you've just got to get very comfortable
37:59 - with doing that so are you able to uh
38:01 - log in or i mean jump into the session
38:04 - that i'm in
38:06 - yeah let me have it let me give that a
38:07 - try so joining
38:10 - and
38:13 - i need to sign in yep so i'm signing in
38:15 - got it
38:19 - authorized horizontal says i created a
38:22 - startup using swift
38:24 - ui and firebase super easy to learn and
38:26 - great to reach a mvp
38:28 - dope nice sick some hey i'm in
38:34 - dough okay awesome i see you
38:38 - now let's open up a shed terminal
38:46 - all right give me one second here we go
38:50 - and also guys like if you're if you're
38:52 - doing this stuff i'd recommend you do
38:54 - what me and kazzy are doing
38:55 - and uh use uh vs live share to go ahead
38:58 - and code with someone else
39:00 - because it's going to help you sort of
39:01 - get past those times where you get stuck
39:03 - and
39:04 - stuff isn't playing with you and it's
39:06 - going to get past all that boring stuff
39:07 - you know
39:08 - all right there we go awesome
39:11 - okay so now i can see that so unless
39:14 - let's go ahead and do so now
39:15 - i'm just gonna i know it's gonna fail
39:17 - but this is so previously what we're
39:19 - used to
39:19 - is npm start we can do that but we're
39:21 - gonna do npm
39:22 - run ios and it should freak out and tell
39:25 - us that we haven't done
39:26 - something right because that's what we
39:28 - were getting before okay there we go
39:30 - so unable to find sim cito could not get
39:33 - the similar list blah blah blah
39:36 - okay this is because did you run pod
39:39 - install
39:40 - so now we need to go ahead and go back
39:42 - into let's go cd
39:44 - ios now we're inside of ios and we're
39:46 - going to do pod
39:48 - install now in ios you have things
39:50 - called pods
39:51 - just like in javascript you have node
39:54 - modules
39:55 - right so in javascript you have node
39:56 - modules in ios you have something called
39:58 - pods
39:59 - uh it's pretty much just you're just
40:01 - pulling in code from somewhere else
40:03 - into your into your app so now i can see
40:05 - the error here so it's unable to look up
40:07 - iphone ios okay so it looks like
40:10 - we don't have the um and
40:13 - a simulator installed which means
40:17 - we need to open up um
40:21 - we need to open up vs xcode um
40:24 - yeah xcode again oh by the way guys i do
40:27 - want to actually mention
40:28 - something really really cool this is a
40:30 - side note but i
40:31 - am super excited about this sunny and i
40:33 - are both excited
40:35 - because a lot of you guys want to
40:36 - actually get in touch with us and speak
40:38 - with us so we now have a way
40:41 - for you to actually be able to send us a
40:43 - text message
40:45 - directly and uh if you guys want access
40:48 - to being able to send us a message
40:50 - directly
40:50 - just let us know in the chat below and
40:53 - then we'll make sure we'll
40:54 - show it to you guys but uh here is one
40:58 - easy way to actually kind of get started
41:00 - on this
41:01 - uh go ahead and send us a text
41:05 - here
41:09 - yeah there you go go ahead and do that
41:11 - guys get in touch with us
41:13 - easiest way to get in touch with us yeah
41:15 - text us
41:18 - there
41:20 - garyvee style yeah seriously this is
41:22 - awesome i picked it up from garyvee and
41:25 - i'm psyched it's the
41:26 - easiest way for me for sonny to actually
41:29 - get in touch with the entire community
41:31 - and i'm just so gassed about this like
41:33 - this was not something we had before and
41:36 - now we have it so i want to take
41:37 - advantage of it
41:39 - exactly 100 and it's so cool guys it
41:42 - means
41:43 - it's literally this the easiest most
41:46 - less friction way that you guys can
41:48 - contact us
41:49 - yeah so really really nice okay
41:55 - where is the uh
41:59 - you might need to update your i o
42:02 - your x code because you open up app
42:04 - store and just that's what i was
42:05 - actually
42:05 - doing i was thinking to update my yeah
42:08 - it could be
42:11 - it could be a day this like
42:13 - installing stuff
42:14 - is one of the worst things on
42:17 - the planet with coding
42:19 - it's just never easy and it's the
42:22 - it's like a really frustrating thing
42:23 - doesn't matter how experienced of a
42:24 - developer you are
42:26 - and this is why i really like getting
42:29 - started
42:30 - with these online um
42:33 - online tools like these like expo and
42:35 - stuff and i think why they're becoming
42:37 - so popular all these are online ids
42:40 - update there we go there we go yeah
42:44 - we'll see how long that takes well
42:45 - that's what we actually have to
42:47 - do so
42:48 - i think is it oh is that saying
42:50 - mavericks or something
42:52 - um what does it say i need to be on
42:55 - i need to update my mac os so i think
42:58 - for now right okay so in that case
43:02 - dude we might as well do expo together
43:04 - and show them yeah i would
43:05 - just do it i mean i've never used expo
43:07 - but we can go ahead and learn it
43:08 - together
43:10 - i mean it's probably just easier and it
43:12 - probably works right out the box
43:15 - exactly yeah yeah so
43:18 - tell you what let's go back to the
43:19 - inside documentation and then we can
43:21 - actually go ahead and jump into
43:24 - that um the expo all right i'm gonna go
43:27 - learn the basics
43:30 - um yeah so
43:34 - that link i sent you uh we have to
43:36 - install the expo cli
43:38 - and things like that wait do you wanna
43:40 - but why can't we just use
43:41 - this here this url because we wanna go
43:45 - ahead and make sure we have everything
43:47 - set up first um we'll because you
43:50 - let's not use this one this is let's
43:52 - actually
43:53 - actually on our own computer yeah
43:57 - okay that was that's what i thought of i
43:59 - was saying actually in uh in the chat
44:01 - and i was thinking to go that route
44:04 - yeah because that'd be cool yeah we can
44:06 - do that and then that way you guys with
44:08 - windows
44:09 - and pretty much follow along so smash
44:11 - the thumbs up button
44:13 - if you're a windows user and this is
44:15 - going to help you out
44:17 - okay so this one it's actually the link
44:19 - i sent you quasi um
44:24 - you know the getting started link it has
44:26 - everything in that one
44:27 - we clicked last time we clicked react
44:28 - native cli but let's just click on the
44:31 - expo
44:31 - one inside andy says does pwj have mern
44:34 - projects
44:35 - want to join the course
44:38 - uh yeah we do have mum projects inside
44:40 - yeah and we actually
44:41 - go ahead and inside the coaching course
44:44 - we do a ton of different
44:46 - builds and things like that live with
44:50 - our students so
44:51 - it's it's always growing it's always
44:52 - dynamic we cover everything
44:54 - inside of the inside that course yeah
44:57 - hell yeah that's the answer bro
44:59 - so yeah and on those live calls if you
45:01 - have any questions we
45:02 - do cover anything related to learn yeah
45:07 - exactly you won't regret it andy just
45:10 - jump
45:10 - in jump in in that program you won't
45:12 - regret it and uh
45:14 - all of those things that you're trying
45:15 - to learn you'll learn them extremely
45:16 - well
45:17 - go ahead sonny yeah exactly
45:20 - um so now we're doing uh okay you done
45:24 - it yeah
45:25 - install dash g um also guys if you
45:27 - didn't know whenever you do npm install
45:29 - dash g
45:30 - it's like installing it to your computer
45:33 - here's
45:33 - here is hold on sunny this is i actually
45:35 - want to say this
45:37 - yeah we are on the official react native
45:40 - website right
45:42 - yep bro look at this even they
45:45 - are by default promoting the expo cli
45:48 - yeah that's what that's what i was
45:50 - really shocked about i would go with
45:52 - this bro
45:53 - i would honestly think that this is the
45:55 - way to go
45:56 - yeah because uh it is like
45:59 - i've never i hadn't touched it in a
46:01 - while and then
46:02 - to see that they were pushing it um i
46:05 - mean 100 i wouldn't
46:06 - resist it and plus when i was looking at
46:08 - expo the website
46:09 - they had a bunch of additional things
46:11 - like push notifications going to install
46:13 - the expo app as well bro
46:15 - i want to install the expo app do you
46:17 - think the students can um
46:20 - yes they might be able to do it to
46:22 - literally look at
46:23 - our app or is that like will that give
46:26 - away some security thing you know what
46:28 - i'm saying
46:30 - um i think we'll be good it should be
46:31 - good okay so guys go ahead and download
46:34 - expo on your phone so i'm actually gonna
46:37 - install it as well now so expo on the
46:39 - app store
46:40 - and let's see let's just go ahead and
46:42 - install that
46:43 - i just i just downloaded expo
46:47 - this should be expo expo client
46:50 - yeah and then yeah they can use the qr
46:54 - code i think yeah so that's what shriek
46:56 - is saying as well
46:57 - so everyone can pretty much go ahead and
46:58 - try out that would be dope man
47:00 - imagine that
47:04 - we building up and you guys can just
47:05 - play around with it using the expo
47:08 - people are messaging us on the chat
47:10 - that's pretty cool we got joseph choose
47:12 - there
47:12 - atharva is there steven derek johnson
47:15 - that is super cool
47:17 - i'm going to give you access to this too
47:19 - sonny so you can communicate with
47:20 - everybody this is dope
47:22 - gypsy
47:35 - i know crazy i got uh
47:39 - cool so i'm gonna dude what i really
47:40 - like about this is that
47:42 - i think it's gonna be running on their
47:44 - um sort of cloud
47:45 - you know like their sort of their
47:47 - devices um i mean i'm not sure but
47:50 - if they are then i think oh my god
47:51 - that's game because
47:53 - react native it the debugging in react
47:56 - native is so slow because you're running
47:58 - simulators all the time so
47:59 - if you can do it on expo and they're
48:01 - doing it and they take that slow lagging
48:03 - like annoyance cool thing about flutter
48:06 - debugging is really fast
48:08 - the hot reload is pretty epic with
48:10 - flutter
48:12 - yeah so they they improved it a lot with
48:15 - uh with react native but even after i
48:17 - did it today
48:18 - i was like i remembered the frustration
48:20 - and coding and react compared to react
48:22 - native
48:23 - the speed is just insanely different
48:25 - reacting it has got a lot of
48:27 - you get so much more teething issues
48:29 - once you get into a rhythm you're good
48:30 - but
48:31 - the initial setup is a lot more painful
48:34 - um
48:36 - yo we gotta do this every day bro gotta
48:39 - even even if we don't do lives every day
48:43 - we should just get together for 15
48:44 - minutes and shoot
48:46 - a video on just one thing
48:49 - like even the questions people are
48:50 - asking which laptop is the best like
48:52 - something bro
48:54 - so it's a habit for us to do something
48:56 - because this is
48:58 - this is a game changer yeah literally
49:01 - one session back and i can already feel
49:03 - the energy from everyone watching almost
49:04 - a thousand likes already guys
49:08 - when shit's good shit's good man like
49:10 - that's yeah that's how i put it
49:12 - so let's try this expo init um first
49:17 - react native
49:20 - all right let's try it yeah i just have
49:24 - a feeling it's gonna work
49:25 - and if it does i'm not going to the
49:27 - other way of doing it bro i
49:29 - i just i'm down with that i hate the
49:32 - other way of doing it
49:35 - a minimal app as clean as an empty
49:37 - canvas uh
49:38 - typescript mineral but just the
49:39 - essentials to get you started you want
49:41 - to go with uh
49:44 - so no typescript um blank or minimal
49:48 - bare and minimal or essentials i mean
49:50 - what it's just we're just blank
49:52 - it's a bit hard to see once i'm going
49:54 - blank bro you took too long to
49:56 - decide
49:58 - all right did you do yeah what managed
50:00 - what's that
50:01 - i said uh the manage work the the first
50:04 - one
50:05 - yeah yeah i was gonna say whatever they
50:07 - gave us by default
50:09 - so i'm excited oh
50:12 - another one dude damn oh we should have
50:15 - another one
50:17 - antonio cortez gonna go ahead and pull
50:19 - down
50:20 - on the screen um i can't it's not
50:22 - showing up for me yet

52:22 - to
52:22 - npm start because it's in line with the
52:24 - whole
52:25 - react app so thank you so much as well

52:52 - credit card information in here
52:54 - no not nice it should be fun dude
52:56 - honestly it should be fun
52:57 - all right so lan i can create a tunnel
53:00 - as well right and on that tunnel
53:01 - everybody should be able to check out
53:03 - the app
53:04 - yes bro oh no but you don't need to dude
53:07 - you don't need to look at that qr code
53:10 - that's sick but i mean they can't see
53:12 - the qr code

53:20 - dude
53:21 - i can pull out my phone on the expo
53:22 - client are you serious
53:24 - let me try it right now oh right
53:27 - now
53:28 - let's go ahead and see this what the
53:32 - oh i just gotta hover over it
53:34 - makes it big
53:36 - i need to create an account for expo
53:38 - we'll do that in a sec
53:40 - um i've gone ahead and created one as
53:43 - well so
53:44 - i'm going to create an account an expo
53:45 - as well bro um what i need
53:47 - is a usb oh hold on a second
53:53 - sign up for expo okay let me go ahead
53:55 - and create a concrete thing
54:01 - those are people saying you can sign it
54:02 - use tunnel guys
54:04 - this is nice run the app hope it doesn't
54:06 - lag i think it's running on local
54:07 - yeah so i think it would run on local
54:09 - guys and then it tunnels it through so
54:10 - you can pretty much use everything
54:12 - uh as we do it so that's pretty much how
54:14 - we would use ngrok as well so ngrok is
54:16 - the alternative
54:17 - that we pretty much use when we do um yo
54:20 - what's up aaron
54:21 - he says oh
54:24 - you can plug it in here too i think nice
54:27 - and um
54:31 - yep all right bro thank you
54:36 - um okay i just want to see if i can set
54:39 - up a screen
54:40 - where i can um show my
54:44 - phone so called some iphone
54:49 - and um would you like to
54:53 - i want to try something if i scan it
54:56 - just by
54:58 - let's go ahead and try something
55:02 - okay open in expo open in expo opening
55:06 - project
55:14 - oh yeah you would want it on tunnel
55:15 - aussie all right
55:17 - yeah yeah yeah you'd want to untunnel
55:21 - okay and did you did the scan work for
55:24 - you
55:26 - so change it to tunnel i i did i did ton
55:28 - already
55:29 - it's on time guys if you don't know how
55:32 - to scan this literally just pull out
55:33 - your camera app
55:34 - and uh and then do it and then it'll
55:36 - work um it says new update available
55:40 - building javascript bundle dude this is
55:43 - pretty insane man like a
55:44 - holy cause when i when i used to
55:46 - use react native this stuff wasn't
55:48 - out like is it is it working
55:51 - or is it about yes it's building a
55:53 - javascript bundle yep it's five percent
55:56 - it's it's doing some stuff right now but
55:59 - we'll see how that works out
56:01 - okay
56:04 - okay so press a
56:08 - dude i'm actually getting so excited
56:11 - i know man
56:14 - oh i see so dude when you've got the
56:18 - the um apparently i was making projects
56:21 - with it bro a while ago
56:22 - on i have the expo app everything i'm
56:24 - like look i have an account
56:26 - i like was making projects so yeah yeah
56:29 -  crazy
56:30 - all right um how do i go on my app and
56:33 - scan it i don't even know where to go
56:36 - so there's a few ways you can work on it
56:38 - right um
56:40 - now this is a debugger base how did this
56:42 - open
56:44 - that's like i think you must have hit a
56:46 - debug option or something but
56:48 - if you click on go back to your terminal
56:51 - pretty sure i didn't do
56:52 - anything what is happening
56:56 - yeah so react native has a lot of things
56:58 - behind the scenes so
56:59 - it will have a bundler which is always
57:01 - running right
57:02 - so whenever you're whenever you make a
57:04 - change it rebundles your app
57:06 - and it sort of serves it right
57:09 - yeah so now if we open up your
57:14 - um okay so it's been checked
57:18 - i wonder why my iphone isn't showing as
57:20 - a resource
57:24 - on ecam
57:28 - oh i've got it working on my on my
57:31 - local
57:38 - dovahkiin says is this the beginning of
57:40 - a react native series
57:41 - hell yeah are you what are you trying to
57:45 - run it on right now kazi
57:49 - what so we'll maybe go ahead and get
57:51 - them to connect to it afterwards because
57:52 - that'll take a while
57:54 - well in your one now if you go ahead and
57:57 - um
57:57 - you should have a terminal that's open
57:59 - right now right
58:02 - uh terminal that's open right now okay
58:06 - yeah did you have a terminal it's open
58:07 - right now and what you want to do
58:10 - on that terminal is what we're going to
58:13 - do guys
58:14 - is we're going to develop it on a like a
58:17 - web browser
58:18 - but it's building all of it for ios and
58:21 - android so i'll show you what i mean by
58:22 - that so on that
58:23 - so go to that that uh terminal that
58:25 - you're on
58:27 - uh-huh yep um so
58:30 - that one and then press so you either
58:33 - press i for ios
58:35 - a for android or w for uh web browsers
58:38 - press w
58:42 - all right attempting to open the browser
58:44 - in a web browser so right so
58:45 - now open the project and what we can do
58:47 - now is this gives us a really nice
58:49 - benefit because now
58:51 - we can code it with the speed of a web
58:53 - browser yeah
58:54 - that's sick yeah because now you can
58:58 - code it with all of the speed of a web
59:00 - browser but
59:01 - you have the it will compile to an ios
59:04 - and android app
59:05 - oh man that is nice
59:12 - this is actually dude like i i had no
59:14 - idea about this to be honest like
59:16 - that's insane that's actually game
59:18 - changer
59:20 - nice all right open up app js to start
59:23 - working on your app
59:25 - interesting so now
59:28 - if you go into your code so it's going
59:31 - to uh
59:35 - just uh send me a live share request
59:38 - afterwards for that one
59:40 - yep first react native
59:43 - code
59:53 - guys if you're enjoying this right now
59:54 - hit the thumbs up button and get this
59:56 - video out to as many people as
59:59 - oh it you weird it wasn't auto
60:00 - completing but i used that trick bro
60:04 - i used that trick and it worked it's
60:06 - good right
60:08 - it's amazing
60:12 - oh my god that whole reason i didn't
60:14 - dude this is
60:15 - that's game changer that's actually so
60:18 - good because
60:19 - it takes so long running on the
60:21 - simulator so now the fact you can build
60:23 - it
60:23 - on a web browser and still have oh my
60:26 - god it's
60:28 - such insane
60:31 - develop orgasm yes develop orgasm dude
60:36 - devgasm.com dude that actually would be
60:39 - a great website
60:42 - tinder yeah
60:45 - all the shirts
60:50 - exactly right
60:54 - so let's go to now yeah so app.js
60:58 - now if you change something it's hot
60:59 - reloading and by default
61:02 - so if you type in like open up one two
61:04 - three app.js you should see a hot reload
61:06 - on the right all right so let's go
61:09 - [Music]
61:11 - sunny yeah save
61:14 - there we go nice oh there we go
61:18 - oh also dude look i've got your app
61:19 - tunneled
61:21 - oh are you serious yeah so look so
61:24 - make a change look and you should see it
61:26 - right now in real time
61:28 - oh and yes my phone is correct guys hold
61:30 - on i'm gonna full screen your phone so
61:31 - i'm gonna change it from sunny to
61:34 - youtube with a fire emoji
61:38 - and i'm gonna hit hold on fire emoji
61:41 - why is my emoji alright whatever
61:43 - i'm just gonna hit save
61:44 - oh
61:48 - that is insane let's go save
61:52 - oh
61:53 - [Applause]
61:53 - [Music]
61:55 - that is so dumb yo people are saying it
61:57 - works for them
62:00 - yeah because everyone went ahead and
62:02 - scanned the code
62:06 - yo that is awesome
62:10 - how do i do it bro i want to do it huh
62:13 - i want to do it go to your
62:17 - um uh where is it
62:21 - how do you get does everyone know how
62:22 - you get that code back um
62:26 - okay go to
62:31 - where do we get that code list of
62:33 - available commands open
62:36 - expo
62:37 - [Music]
62:41 - now i got the fire emoji in there
62:46 - nice all right
62:49 - so now what i'm going to do this is so
62:51 - cool knowing that i'm on your guys
62:53 - freaking
62:54 - computers right in your phones right now
62:57 - it's sick crazy man um
63:03 - all right i'm gonna go and learn the
63:05 - basics while sonny figures that out
63:10 - anyone knows by the way just drop it in
63:12 - the in the comment section
63:15 - all right so hello world justify center
63:18 - okay
63:21 - i'm just flying through the tutorial so
63:23 - i can do some fun bro
63:26 - i'm going to tutorial like how i would
63:27 - go through it
63:29 - all right i'm gonna i'm gonna drop this
63:31 - and let's see what happens
63:34 - so you can go to
63:37 - oh i it up
63:44 - all right we're back baby we
63:47 - are back
63:54 - it is running at your local it should be
63:56 - running at your local host
63:59 - or 19002
64:03 - um i have no idea what that means bro
64:07 - so go to localhost colon
64:09 - [Music]
64:11 - so open up a tab go to localhost called
64:14 - on
64:14 - get out of the debugger yeah so it could
64:18 - be any yes local
64:19 - [Music]
64:20 - 19002 ah okay
64:24 - and then should get back to you there
64:26 - you go but
64:28 - how do i oh i just go open up the camera
64:31 - on my phone
64:33 - yeah so dude you don't have to do
64:34 - anything literally open up the camera
64:35 - and it'll say open the next
64:41 - you're right all i had to do was just
64:43 - open up the camera on my phone and just
64:45 - look at it
64:47 - yeah if you ever lose that and you don't
64:49 - remember the um
64:50 - uh how to get back you just you cancel
64:53 - it and your npm start and it'll go ahead
64:55 - and
64:56 - build it and take you to this page by
64:57 - the phone
64:59 - save yeah oh and you've
65:02 - dude you've also got clickable things on
65:04 - the left look where it says um
65:07 - run in web browser running ios can you
65:09 - see that
65:10 - i'm just going to leave this i'm just
65:12 - going to leave this open here so anybody
65:14 - that wants to
65:15 - um do it they can just make sure
65:18 - make sure there's a tunnel mode dude but
65:21 - why does it keep forcing me to go to the
65:23 - debugger
65:24 - like i don't care about going
65:27 - the debugger is uh so now if you were to
65:31 - uh inspect the debugger you would see
65:34 - all the console logs from the app
65:36 - and the reason why the debugger is
65:38 - running is because we've got it running
65:40 - on the
65:41 - on um oh there we go
65:45 - all right so anybody if you just open up
65:47 - your camera and point to it
65:49 - on iphone and we'll bring you here i
65:51 - don't know if an android does it or not
65:53 - people are like yeah it's working james
65:54 - gayle dude that's so cool bro this is
65:57 - honestly even easier than
65:58 - like anything this is so cool and now
66:01 - you guys go ahead and play with that as
66:03 - we code which is so dope
66:05 - like they can actually play around with
66:06 - the app as we build it on their phones
66:08 - dude
66:15 - wow shake your phone to reload dude this
66:17 - is gonna be a whole nother level
66:19 - of like interactive coding yes this is
66:22 - another level of interactive coding bro
66:24 - like
66:25 - actually being able to see the app on
66:27 - your phone as you're with us
66:29 - that is insane bro
66:32 - i just typed in papa react made this
66:34 - change oh my god that is
66:36 -  sick holy showed up on your
66:38 - computer
66:40 - oh and 9006 shows you the actual app
66:47 - what was that the nine 1906
66:51 - shows you the actual app 1902
66:55 - no 19. 1906. oh the actual
66:59 - yeah yeah
67:03 - that's the that's the actual web app
67:05 - right
67:07 - yeah nice bro
67:11 - now oh my god now share your um share
67:15 - your local host with me
67:16 - you're 1902 in 1906.
67:20 - um how do i what do you mean
67:25 - so on vs code liveshare if you share
67:27 - 1906 with me now i get your win
67:29 - your web how do i do that
67:33 - you go to share server uh-huh
67:39 - yeah 1906.
67:44 - and then yep snap son
67:49 - and now i can see
67:52 - yeah oh yeah i can see it now i'll give
67:54 - you 1901
67:56 - as well so you have all of them yeah
67:59 - that is so sick man they just figured
68:01 - out how to do
68:03 - live coding with uh react native
68:06 - in a way that they can even go ahead and
68:08 - play with the app people are saying use
68:10 - lan instead
68:11 - tunnel is slow no lan is for
68:14 - local guys that means that you guys
68:16 - can't connect oh
68:18 - yeah okay yeah
68:21 - so we want it so you guys can go ahead
68:23 - and connect as well
68:25 - um okay
68:30 - and also if you don't have the app then
68:32 - it will go ahead and download
68:34 - uh expo for you dude xbox game changer
68:38 - damn i'm happy i'm really happy it kind
68:40 - of
68:40 - like didn't install reactions by the
68:43 - floor yes i'm super happy
68:45 - as soon as stuff starts like bugging out
68:47 - i'm like it i'm finding a different
68:49 - way to go about this
68:51 - that's like yeah back in the day dude
68:54 - this
68:55 - it wasn't available like that you know
68:59 - so it's more of a new thing now that we
69:01 - can get to this but dude this is why
69:03 - years ago i discovered expo like as soon
69:05 - as i run into any kind of
69:07 - difficulty i'm just installing i go
69:09 - crazy with researching like
69:11 - there's always some kind of tools that
69:13 - are
69:14 - there to make your lives easier
69:17 - there is now it's so popular that react
69:19 - native has put it on their front page
69:22 - years ago when i found it like nobody
69:24 - cared about it
69:26 - yeah exactly
69:30 - right so now we have the app on the left
69:32 - and we've got all right on the right
69:34 - dope now i'm in as well okay now let's
69:36 - run through some of that
69:38 - the sort of like layout of the code
69:39 - right then we can kind of like
69:41 - you know mess around with it a bit
69:45 - i just want to check at a
69:48 - [Music]
70:00 - just want to check i don't even know
70:03 - the default imports but we'll figure it
70:05 - out together yeah i'm just
70:06 - doing random okay give me one
70:08 - second i'm gonna just paste this
70:09 - and see what happens if everything
70:11 - breaks or not
70:16 - oh i did it bro new app
70:21 - oh nice um xbox
70:25 - oh no oh you didn't wait yeah nice you
70:26 - actually got a sh
70:28 - wait the hot reload doesn't work on your
70:29 - phone so you got to like shake your
70:31 - phone and do reload which is
70:33 - wait actually i don't know maybe my
70:35 - internet is bad or something
70:39 - because it's not showing up on my are
70:41 - you shaking your phone
70:44 - yeah i shook it and it says opening
70:46 - project
70:47 - this might just be lagging a bit um
70:50 - that's very possible
70:56 - dude i got square squares bro
70:59 - one more nice when we're live
71:03 - um might be the quickest way to get um
71:07 - you running it on lan connecting your
71:10 - phone
71:10 - and then you know how you share your
71:12 - screen on the phone so you so that way
71:14 - if you ever wanted to show what it looks
71:15 - like on a phone
71:16 - i'm trying to do that also for some
71:18 - reason my phone isn't being pulled up as
71:20 - a screen
71:21 - i was trying to do that for a while if
71:24 - you open up that terminal so open up the
71:26 - um i don't know if you if your ios
71:28 - emulator is going to be able to run
71:29 - actually because you haven't got the um
71:31 - the latest dev tools but open up that
71:35 - term
71:35 - the one that's running everything and
71:38 - let's go to or which one what was it i
71:42 - i for ios yeah
71:45 - it'll be i tried okay
71:48 - yeah and then that should try and yeah
71:50 - there we go no
71:52 - ios simulator it should work
71:55 - it should work but i mean oh iphone 11
71:59 - pro max let's go
72:02 - it crashed let's go
72:10 - oh that is exciting that is exciting
72:14 - all right give me one second dude i
72:16 - gotta use the restroom i've been
72:17 - drinking too much water
72:21 - go for it guys let us know in the
72:24 - comments right now
72:25 - if you're if you've used expo before um
72:28 - so
72:29 - yeah so loads of people are saying too
72:30 - many people are connecting if most
72:32 - likely yeah
72:33 - if we're tunneling it it could be
72:35 - slowing things down
72:36 - um but let's just have a look so you see
72:39 - how really it's working fine without the
72:41 - shaking
72:42 - um it does guys but it might slow down
72:45 - when when you start to get into
72:46 - and um sharing across different guys
72:49 - um which type of man could be higher
72:51 - skills
72:53 - which is cheaper to use as a solo dev
72:55 - firebase or mongodb
72:57 - atlas okay so if you're a solo developer
73:00 - uh it depends what kind of project
73:02 - you're doing if you're doing like a
73:03 - freelancing gig
73:05 - i would tend to go with firebase
73:06 - firebase is sort of the one that like
73:08 - you can pretty much scale up very
73:09 - quickly with
73:11 - long term builds and things like that i
73:13 - would maybe recommend
73:15 - going ahead and looking at uh mongodb
73:19 - we've got plenty of man stack builds by
73:21 - the way so a lot of the builders on this
73:22 - channel
73:23 - will go ahead and teach you how to get
73:25 - an app up and running
73:27 - with firebase and then you can pretty
73:30 - much convert the entire app over to
73:31 - mongodb
73:32 - so that's a good way of doing things
73:34 - actually so that's a really sort of
73:35 - secure way of doing it
73:36 - and we still have 500 people watching
73:38 - guys insane
73:39 - guys i think we're about to break a
73:41 - thousand likes if i'm looking at that
73:43 - number
73:44 - it's currently at ninth day can we break
73:45 - a thousand likes that's gonna be insane
73:47 - if you do you guys enjoy me and kazi
73:49 - coming back together live
73:51 - because it's been fun and we've
73:52 - definitely just made a few breakthroughs
73:54 - already
73:55 - um with the very short amount of time
73:57 - that we're where they were here
73:58 - uh yeah and guys super chat is just oh
74:01 - my god it's insane
74:02 - um right so with that said let's check
74:05 - some things where we got the view right
74:07 - here
74:07 - dope and now look the app is actually up
74:10 - and running
74:11 - on my phone so you guys should be able
74:12 - to see that right now
74:14 - the app is over then it's actually
74:15 - running so it's actually got everything
74:17 - up and running over there
74:19 - and what we're going to do is can you
74:22 - see so
74:23 - i want to show you guys something right
74:25 - so you see right now on
74:26 - iphones right so on iphones and things
74:28 - like that you see at the top you've got
74:30 - this little notch and yes my phone is
74:32 - cracked
74:32 - for everyone that's done before but um i
74:35 - can't actually change the view right now
74:37 - because cars is away but what we're
74:38 - going to see
74:38 - if you guys can focus over here so you
74:40 - see this little safe area
74:42 - we call it a safe area now the reason
74:45 - the reason why we call it a safe area is
74:47 - because you need to be able to see
74:49 - in that area right so what i'm going to
74:51 - do now is go ahead and type in
74:54 - react native safe area i'm going to
74:56 - change
74:59 - that code so that it accommodates for
75:01 - the safe area okay
75:03 - and the way we're going to do that is
75:04 - i'm going to go here and import it at
75:06 - the top so we're going to say
75:08 - import from react native safe area so
75:11 - you can see i'm actually changing the
75:12 - code right now
75:14 - um you guys should be able to see that
75:16 - still
75:18 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
75:20 - going to go over here
75:21 - and then to the view rather than a view
75:24 - i'm going to just change this to
75:26 - a safe area view save it
75:29 - and now we should see the app still
75:31 - works right app still looks completely
75:33 - the same
75:34 - but there we go look at that so now
75:37 - on the phone if you guys can see now
75:41 - they see that little gap right we just
75:43 - changed the liner code with the safer
75:45 - review
75:46 - and now you see that right there like it
75:48 - doesn't it it no longer
75:50 - crops that area so we call that the safe
75:52 - area so you sometimes you want to go
75:54 - into that safe area
75:56 - sometimes you don't want to go into the
75:57 - safe area uh in this case
75:59 - imagine you had a menu you don't want
76:02 - that to like
76:02 - feed into the safe area right you don't
76:05 - you don't want that behavior because it
76:06 - doesn't look the best
76:07 - it's not going to be be the um best
76:10 - experience right
76:12 - um so with that done
76:16 - now what we're going to do is maybe mess
76:17 - around with a few other things so let's
76:18 - go ahead and imagine we
76:20 - had um let's just create a very simple
76:22 - app oh
76:23 - also i saw this a class based component
76:25 - i don't want this um
76:26 - instead of this i'm going to go ahead
76:28 - and just do
76:29 - a let's go ahead and refactor this to be
76:32 - a
76:33 - um let's go ahead and say const
76:36 - let's just call it app equals boom
76:39 - this is a class-based component and then
76:42 - i'm going to say export default
76:44 - app and we're going to export it and
76:46 - then here we don't have render inside of
76:48 - a class-based component
76:50 - save it and this should still be working
76:53 - if we've done everything right so there
76:54 - we go
76:55 - everything still looks pretty good if
76:57 - i'm if i didn't break everything yeah
76:59 - there we go
77:00 - it's all pretty good everything is
77:01 - working in the way that we wanted
77:04 - um so those are people saying it's
77:06 - working
77:07 - so you can use react native for android
77:09 - apps or is it only for ios
77:10 - good question steven so uh the reason
77:14 - why you want to be using react native
77:16 - guys is because the beauty is you write
77:18 - one code base
77:19 - and it compares to ios and android so
77:22 - you don't actually have to write two
77:23 - separate code bases
77:25 - um so that's the whole reason we
77:26 - actually use it
77:29 - yo what's up all right so what's going
77:32 - on here man what's this
77:34 - um what's this
77:37 - so i refacted the code to a it was a
77:40 - class-based component before so i made
77:41 - it functional
77:42 - also what i did was i went ahead
77:45 - and you see i added this safe area view
77:48 - instead of a default view
77:49 - the reason why is because if you go
77:51 - ahead and open up
77:52 - so let's go in the simulator now and um
77:56 - let's actually open up the app so inside
77:58 - of
77:59 - uh we should be able to see it on the
78:01 - homepage now can we see expo no
78:03 - uh maybe just hit uh i again on the
78:06 - terminal
78:07 - how real did they make it bro do
78:09 - we have to go to the app store and
78:10 - download it
78:13 - if we should just go ahead and like
78:15 - fling it over so again this is
78:17 - this is most likely i think because of
78:19 - the um
78:21 - my guess is going to be because of uh
78:23 - expo the oh
78:25 - yeah no the oh the um operating system
78:28 - stuff because we've got an async
78:30 - function without a catch block and
78:31 - things like that go up to the top let's
78:32 - have a look at the top
78:34 - what top what top five you're cutting
78:36 - off an error
78:37 - right now with your there we go she says
78:40 - it says task queues go up
78:41 - up again so child process all right yeah
78:44 - so the xc runs
78:46 - yeah probably yeah yeah cool
78:49 - so that's definitely because of that
78:51 - most likely so
78:53 - um you should be able to see now
78:56 - because it's running a bit slow dude so
78:57 - if you want to go ahead and do
79:00 - instead of tunneling it do it on your
79:02 - lan and then can you share your phone
79:04 - view
79:05 - no i can't that's what i was trying to
79:07 - tell you earlier like for some reason
79:08 - it's not allowing me to share my
79:10 - phone video oh yeah all right okay so we
79:13 - still have okay cool
79:14 - so i was showing them before that you
79:17 - know like can you see my phone now
79:19 - so you see like on the top right it says
79:22 - it has like it goes into this boundary
79:25 - so this is what we call the safe zone
79:27 - boundary
79:28 - see that yeah yeah yeah yeah
79:31 - so what you want to do is in your code
79:34 - you see that we've got this safe area
79:35 - view
79:36 - container right yeah and what this does
79:39 - is it stops it from going into that
79:41 - dangerous boundary
79:43 - oh let me actually so we'll pad the
79:46 - top and bottom of the app
79:48 - yeah right so actually go ahead and pad
79:51 - the top and bottom of the app
79:52 - so now i don't know how we're gonna
79:54 - where we can show that in an easy
79:56 - way though because my my expo isn't
79:59 - actually pulling up
80:00 - in time anyway slow
80:05 - oh aaron said bro you beast
80:12 - um okay
80:16 - so attempting to open a point okay so
80:19 - we'll just carry on from this time so
80:21 - we've got the view let's go ahead and
80:22 - refactor this let's get rid of this
80:26 - and can you see how ozzie added this
80:29 - before where it's got style width high
80:31 - background color blue right so here
80:33 - let's go ahead and just make it very
80:35 - obvious so background color red
80:36 - we should see just a red square now now
80:39 - this is kind of how we style things
80:40 - inside of react native right
80:42 - now there is a way of doing this i'm
80:43 - going to quickly find the snippet
80:45 - for that so i'm going to check the docs
80:48 - and i'm just going through the react
80:49 - native docs
80:50 - i'm just trying to find the styling
80:53 - section so i think it's design
80:56 - style and then what we have is something
81:00 - like this
81:01 - right so underneath our code this is
81:04 - typically how you would do it you have
81:05 - something like this we have a style
81:06 - sheet
81:07 - right so i'm not going to kind of um
81:12 - we'll explain this but in a second but
81:14 - what we can do now is where you've got
81:16 - the style
81:16 - here you can pretty much just go ahead
81:20 - and say something like styles
81:22 - dot and then for this first view imagine
81:25 - we just
81:25 - called this one the um let's just call
81:29 - it first
81:30 - label and this is going to be i know
81:32 - this is a view
81:33 - label lesson l-a-b-e-l right
81:41 - you yeah and then boom get rid of this
81:45 - okay and then let's go ahead and so now
81:48 - we've got a view inside of a safe view
81:49 - and we're gonna have text
81:51 - and this text is gonna say hello world
81:54 - so like this hello world and then
81:57 - we're going to delete a lot of this
81:58 - we're going to keep one reference so we
82:00 - know how to write stuff and then we're
82:01 - going to say
82:02 - something like this so it's a first
82:03 - label this is the view
82:06 - and then guys imagine css but camel case
82:09 - so all the properties now
82:11 - rather than so imagine you had like
82:12 - background color and background color
82:14 - usually is like this right
82:15 - but when you do it in this fashion it's
82:17 - like that you just camel case instead
82:20 - right so in this case we could do
82:21 - something like background color red
82:23 - and let's just save this and we'll see
82:25 - if it works so
82:26 - now we go ahead save it
82:31 - let's see if we can we can't okay so
82:33 - stylesheet.create is not a
82:35 - function that's because we have an
82:37 - imported style sheet from
82:38 - react native so we need to go to the top
82:40 - import that save it
82:43 - and then we should um should get past
82:46 - that error
82:47 - let's see what happens now and
82:51 - so it says confirm to construct text
82:52 - okay because we didn't import text as
82:54 - well
82:55 - so import text and you will get really
82:59 - quick with this sort of stuff like
83:00 - remember even when we do the reacts
83:02 - there we go so now we have like hello
83:04 - world
83:04 - has popped up on our screen so because
83:06 - if you've got this open on your local
83:08 - host on your
83:09 - yeah um right
83:12 - what is the first link
83:15 - so this is just the view itself but i
83:18 - mean the actual i guess the
83:19 - the actual thing it should be here right
83:22 - it should be more
83:23 - like so this this kind of actually give
83:25 - this a bit more context so let's just
83:26 - say like a to-do
83:27 - right so it says imagine that the first
83:30 - view
83:30 - was like a to-do right so imagine this
83:32 - was called style let's just call this a
83:34 - to-do
83:35 - um actually no dude let's do this
83:38 - properly right so
83:39 - this is just a demo right so we're just
83:40 - showing you how to pull in styles
83:42 - and previously if you watched any of our
83:44 - other builds we would have like another
83:46 - file
83:47 - which would have the css inside of it
83:49 - right so
83:51 - what you can have and i've seen people
83:53 - do it before is people have something
83:55 - like
83:55 - app dot style oh it's right here okay
83:58 - okay okay i was like what the is it
83:59 - but okay i understand now first label
84:01 - first label uh this is where it's
84:03 - pulling its styling from okay okay cool
84:04 - yes
84:05 - exactly yeah oh so i see what you can
84:07 - tend to do now
84:09 - is actually have something called um so
84:11 - so let's go ahead and do command b to
84:13 - open up the sidebar
84:16 - hold on i just want to learn how to
84:19 - change the
84:19 - font size to like equivalent of an h1 oh
84:22 - nice is it just
84:23 - text space h so now you just do font
84:26 - size with a camera
84:29 - uh case up let me see what the is
84:31 - happening oh you didn't write it hold on
84:33 - one second let's
84:34 - save let's see what happens
84:37 - did that work no right uh i didn't i
84:40 - didn't add it
84:41 - um no i i added right here
84:48 - okay let me remove that
84:52 - okay so what's the right way to is there
84:54 - a better way to do it because i don't
84:56 - think that worked
84:57 - i'm just curious because i'm just seeing
85:00 - what
85:00 - they might actually accept a few things
85:03 - which might make it easier
85:04 - um you can have nested text you can have
85:07 - normal text
85:08 - but the way that i would do it normally
85:11 - is
85:12 - have it as this so you see here you just
85:15 - can work so typically in css you would
85:16 - do it like this
85:17 - font size right but in whenever you're
85:20 - doing this stuff you just do it like
85:21 - this to your font size
85:23 - and then here we would do something like
85:24 - 6 15 or 16 or something and then
85:27 - let's go ahead and do that save now this
85:29 - should
85:31 - um i think we might have to do is 16
85:33 - pixels
85:35 - maybe let's go ahead and see if that
85:36 - that reloads let's see that does it
85:38 - quicker
85:40 - um let's make it huge hold on let me do
85:44 - oh so i think it's actually just
85:45 - i think it's just a number actually can
85:47 - i do title tags like that or no
85:50 - oh no no no no i see what's happening
85:52 - okay no that's good
85:53 - you done it right yeah you do but if we
85:55 - do something like
85:57 - so first label oh dude because we're
85:59 - adding the first label sorry this is
86:01 - right
86:01 - yeah so the style shouldn't be here it
86:03 - should be on the text
86:08 - oh so we've got first label
86:11 - and then now
86:15 - all right what we should actually do is
86:17 - we should call it title text title text
86:20 - and that should be better
86:23 - there we go so now it should be sorry
86:25 - there we go so
86:27 - and now if you change this like yeah so
86:29 - and there's a few things to notice right
86:30 - one is the naming
86:32 - so the font this bit changed and also
86:34 - now we don't say pixels i mean we just
86:36 - say 30
86:37 - right i think you can still use pixels
86:39 - if you're passing quotes
86:40 - um but the reason being for these
86:43 - changes is because
86:44 - now we write the code this one way
86:47 - and it will then go ahead and change it
86:50 - for whatever ios
86:51 - supports and whatever android supports
86:54 - okay
86:55 - um um
86:59 - okay oh nice jason francis says no pixel
87:02 - in size and font weight boat
87:04 - yeah dope that's awesome you know so you
87:06 - don't have any pixels
87:07 - i remember there are slight changes like
87:09 - this but yeah it it it's really awesome
87:11 - once you get faster at this it really
87:13 - clears it up
87:14 - um okay oh you haven't got your rocket
87:18 - started
87:19 - um i do but for some reason
87:23 - it just keeps uh
87:26 - not working in the vs code
87:30 - but now it's working okay okay cool
87:33 - all right there we go
87:36 - right so what we're going to do now is
87:38 - we're actually going to show you how
87:40 - easy it is to make a component inside of
87:42 - react native
87:43 - right so let's go ahead and create a new
87:46 - um a new file kazi called to do
87:50 - dot js all right
87:53 - let's go and do that hey we just got a
87:55 - two pound donation thank you brother he
87:57 - goes no px
87:58 - in size and font weight bold
88:02 - nice handy little tip there for everyone
88:04 - all right what were you saying
88:06 - sunny so let's create a file
88:10 - um called to do.js so we're going to
88:12 - create a component
88:14 - which is going to represent a to-do do
88:15 - you want it to be in a
88:17 - folder or just here um
88:20 - so so we i mean this we can capitalize
88:23 - because
88:24 - yeah so because it's a component it'll
88:26 - be capitalized so to do.js
88:29 - dude apparently vs code has some kind of
88:32 - native thing with to do you see that
88:33 - tick mark show up
88:34 - yeah i saw that yeah let me crazy
88:38 - um thing one
88:41 - thing two
88:44 - maybe if you do like
88:50 - ah oh look you've got that little
88:53 - inspect
88:54 - button at the top right here i'm just
88:56 - gonna i'm just gonna delete it bro
88:59 - it's gone
89:03 - to do that js yeah so to do dot js well
89:06 - capital t
89:07 - capital t components got it
89:10 - yep so now we have to do.js and then
89:13 - we're going to do a lovely little rfc
89:16 - trick which is still supported inside of
89:19 - um react native so you see it's just
89:21 - essentially
89:22 - we're going to make an arrow function
89:23 - we're going to do cons to do
89:25 - make it very simple and then here so you
89:28 - see
89:29 - it's showing up on my phone bro it looks
89:30 - so juicy
89:32 - nice let's build a reality native app we
89:35 - need to change
89:36 - this one because the snippet here is for
89:38 - a dip so i think there may be an art if
89:39 - everyone knows the actual snippet for
89:41 - react
89:41 - native i think there is one for that um
89:44 - i think it's r
89:45 - f react native rfm
89:48 - see maybe let's go ahead no r
89:52 - f r react native f
89:55 - function r n f c e sorry sorry
89:58 - r and f apparently there we go
90:02 - that one so it's
90:05 - f yes you've got with stars oh
90:09 - nice with stars as well
90:14 - oh oh is is this our nfc
90:18 - holy you got a big garnish what
90:20 - though that's a big donation
90:23 - how much is that dude i think it's just
90:25 - i think it's 10 10
90:26 - over 10 bucks almost 15 bucks thank you
90:28 - so much
90:29 - avinasha says have you been following
90:31 - wait have been
90:33 - i have been following your content since
90:35 - i met you qazi at vidcon
90:37 - last year what the hell or we talked
90:40 - about being a coder and traveling the
90:41 - world
90:42 - oh i know this boy even though i've been
90:45 - coding for 10 years i learned a lot from
90:46 - these bills keep teaching folks to code
90:48 - and make money
90:49 - that is awesome
90:52 - i met him in real life and him and his
90:54 - wife actually
90:56 - um travel and they make vlogs
90:59 - they were making like food vlogs at the
91:01 - time that were actually killing and
91:02 - blowing up
91:03 - and he was talking about how he's
91:05 - traveling around the world
91:06 - freelancing making an income uh and
91:08 - traveling with his wife
91:10 - that's dope man yeah yeah thank you for
91:14 - this
91:16 - and they're still watching oh dude super
91:18 - cool this is crazy
91:20 - i love it all right
91:24 - so now we have you right so we have the
91:26 - to do here
91:27 - uh and then imagine like in here so i'm
91:29 - just going to say i am a
91:30 - to do okay save it and then we're going
91:33 - to go back into apple
91:34 - we go now hype bro check this
91:37 - out okay
91:38 - these guys are ready for this here we go
91:43 - all right now we're going to switch here
91:47 - boom son hey that's it
91:50 - that's what you're talking about that's
91:52 - on your phone right now yeah
91:54 - buddy dude what i was going to show you
91:57 - is you see on your phone um oh nice it's
92:00 - actually
92:00 - it's cropping at the top though quasi
92:02 - hold on man hold on
92:04 - hold on hold on hold on man i'll
92:07 - fix it
92:13 - um damn it's actually kind of
92:16 - tricky to like we'll be able to see it
92:20 - once we go
92:21 - down on the app
92:24 - or maybe add some lines at the top wait
92:27 - hold on
92:28 - should i hit uh where's the actual app
92:30 - can we do
92:31 - backslash n does that do what we want it
92:34 - to do
92:36 - um i don't think so oh
92:40 - [Music]
92:42 - how do we add new lines will that work
92:47 - i think it's how do you know something
92:51 - hold on add new lines
92:54 - react native this is how i do all my
92:57 - coding
92:59 - how do i insert a line break it's okay
93:02 - yeah so you can do an interpolation on
93:04 - it
93:04 - so you do this thing oh you can
93:10 - yeah you can also do
93:14 - i mean we shouldn't really do that yeah
93:16 - yeah yeah yeah interp
93:18 - hold on
93:22 - you don't want to put a new line
93:25 - no because we let's just get it so that
93:27 - we can maybe
93:28 - i mean i think maybe show it as a full
93:30 - screen as a second scene or something
93:32 - and then we just go back and forth from
93:34 - it so we have it looking we have it like
93:35 - this
93:36 - and then when we want to show it on the
93:38 - phone we just go to a third scene and
93:39 - show it on the phone
93:41 - okay so phone by itself or something
93:45 - else yeah just by itself you know
93:48 - because then
93:48 - i think that would work yeah that's it
93:50 - yeah awesome
93:52 - cool so you see on our code right we
93:54 - have this safe area view
93:56 - if i go ahead and comment this out
93:59 - notice how
94:00 - when i hit save now it's going to jump
94:03 - up to the top i
94:04 - think so it's gonna always freaking out
94:06 - it's saying
94:07 - safe area of yours because i have to get
94:10 - rid of that actually
94:11 - let's go ahead and save that and then
94:15 - now we do it it's gonna go so now cause
94:19 - you look in that phone view
94:21 - um yeah it doesn't look good on the
94:23 - phone view
94:25 - right so because you've got a um iphone
94:27 - xs max
94:28 - right or iphone pro yeah i got a
94:32 - yeah iphone 11 pro gonna show your phone
94:36 - to the screen right now and show them
94:38 - without the safe area view
94:40 - show them how it's cropping into that
94:43 - notch
94:44 - all right i will give me one second let
94:45 - me switch this scene to the iphone scene
94:51 - and uh now let me try it
94:54 - yeah you see that it's actually cropping
94:58 - into the notch at the top
95:00 - i think that's kind of hard for them to
95:01 - see i'll actually show them like this
95:04 - yeah so show them your phone yeah look
95:07 - at this
95:10 - yeah so you guys can see like it's going
95:11 - into that we call that the safe area
95:14 - right well and it should not be in the
95:16 - safe area
95:18 - right so to prevent that the only thing
95:20 - we want in that safe area is
95:22 - sometimes you've got like a header and
95:23 - the color kind of
95:25 - goes out into that into that thing but
95:27 - we don't wanna we don't want that to be
95:29 - the case and
95:29 - i see people saying margin top you can
95:32 - do margins and things like that but
95:33 - the goal here is they built a component
95:36 - for this and the reason and the thing
95:37 - about this component is
95:38 - it only adds that padding if the
95:42 - phone that it's running on has that that
95:45 - sort of complication where it has the
95:47 - notch
95:47 - right because some galaxy android phones
95:50 - have a they call like a
95:51 - non-safe area and things like that now
95:53 - imagine if you had to custom code it for
95:55 - all of those
95:56 - things then you're gonna get into some
95:58 - headache right you're gonna have to like
95:59 - account for the different
96:01 - like it might work for an iphone pro but
96:03 - it might not work for other ones
96:04 - so if you go ahead and add that then it
96:06 - fixes that problem so
96:07 - that does it for that now we created a
96:09 - to-do component so let's go back to
96:11 - the the screen so we can see the code
96:16 - go back to the screen oh yeah
96:20 - good point all right i was like i
96:22 - thought we're showing the screen
96:24 - cool and then now what we're going to do
96:26 - is we're going to say import
96:28 - and we're going to import the to-do app
96:29 - but to do components sorry from our
96:31 - to-do
96:32 - uh file okay and then what we're going
96:34 - to do is we're going to render out a
96:35 - to-do
96:36 - here i'm just going to render out three
96:38 - to do's just like this is just
96:40 - pretty much react as we know it right
96:42 - reactors we know and love it so now
96:43 - we save this we should see um
96:47 - i have a to do i am a to do i meant to
96:49 - do right so if we go ahead and save this
96:52 - it's erroring out i think right now
96:55 - uh oh is it involved because we didn't
96:57 - save the to-do file i just saved it to
96:59 - do file now it'll be good
97:01 - okay yeah there we go it says i am a
97:02 - to-do i'm going to do awesome
97:05 - all right so now we can see the three to
97:08 - do
97:08 - is popped up so that's cool so
97:10 - everything works as we expect
97:11 - now we all have known that we've come to
97:14 - understand react and react
97:16 - each component can have something called
97:18 - props right
97:19 - so nothing has changed in react native
97:22 - we can use the same thing we can use
97:24 - props
97:25 - so in this case what we're going to do
97:26 - is we're going to go to our to-do.js
97:28 - and we're going to accept some props
97:30 - okay so we're going to go props
97:32 - and we're going to destructure the props
97:34 - here we're going to say it's just
97:36 - every to-do has a title so let's go
97:38 - ahead and give it a title
97:40 - um and then here rather than saying i am
97:42 - going to do we're going to have
97:43 - the tick mark and then we're going to
97:44 - say
97:47 - call these title we should call these
97:48 - like react native crash course or
97:50 - something
97:52 - yeah we should okay yeah that's cool man
97:54 - we should do that
97:55 - yeah like crash course um and then here
97:59 - also interesting fact uh i don't know if
98:02 - you saw my post on on instagram but it
98:04 - shows you about es6 destructuring
98:06 - and default values if you don't give it
98:08 - a value right now there's no value there
98:10 - right
98:11 - so if if we didn't give it a value you
98:13 - can actually give it a default fallback
98:15 - so you could say like let's just call it
98:16 - like um
98:18 - like if you don't give it a value then
98:19 - it'll by default go to take the dogs out
98:22 - for a walk let's just give it a random
98:23 - example take dogs out for a while
98:25 - and we say that now every single one
98:28 - which wasn't past the prop by default
98:30 - gets take dogs out for a walk
98:32 - i see that is the iphone simulator
98:36 - working now or no
98:38 - um it's it's a bit slow so right now
98:41 - it's not like uh it's not reaching over
98:43 - there
98:43 - see i'm still on that old example i see
98:46 - as in the tunnel
98:47 - the tunnel isn't working um the the
98:50 - simulator isn't working because of the
98:52 - operating system
98:54 - oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i remember
98:55 - yeah so now if we go to app.js
98:58 - and we go back here um what we can do is
99:01 - just go ahead and pass in the title so
99:02 - for the first one we can say like let's
99:04 - just say take trash out
99:05 - so because you need to go to is you just
99:07 - follow me
99:10 - yep there we go so we're going to say
99:12 - take the trash out
99:14 - the second one we're going to say code
99:17 - react native
99:21 - tin devs
99:24 - and then the final one will say eat code
99:27 - sleep
99:30 - nice and now we should be able to save
99:32 - that and we should see that get passed
99:34 - through
99:35 - as props right so now you can see
99:38 - this is awesome right because now all of
99:40 - our react knowledge
99:41 - is pretty much safe to say that it's
99:44 - being carried across to react near right
99:46 - um now we haven't touched on any of the
99:48 - actual react native core things like you
99:50 - know the
99:51 - the header navigation things like that
99:53 - we're just showing you how to get up and
99:54 - running
99:55 - with the react native sort of starting
99:57 - template there's the sort of differences
99:59 - initially and what we can do is after we
100:01 - get this like a to-do app working we can
100:03 - go ahead and introduce some of that
100:05 - functionality
100:06 - um but i think about it with react
100:08 - native they make it so easy dude to have
100:10 - like
100:10 - tabs yeah as well as like navigation
100:13 - stacks so you know that when you go
100:14 - forward
100:15 - and you can hit back and swipe back and
100:17 - things like that
100:18 - dude i just got pretty quick a pretty
100:20 - genius idea
100:23 - what's up oh damn i was gonna actually
100:26 - screen record
100:28 - my iphone screen and then yeah
100:31 - play it as an ig reel with the time
100:33 - lapse so on
100:34 - so basically you'd be able to see the
100:36 - app developing from scratch to like
100:38 - finish
100:38 - of hours of work you see what i'm saying
100:41 - oh
100:41 - nice yeah an iphone
100:45 - we'll do that yeah we'll have it running
100:47 - on on yeah that was like
100:48 - i can't do that because i'm sharing my
100:51 - iphone
100:51 - and trying to do that so it doesn't work
100:54 - well we'll find a way to to capture it
100:56 - do i need this screen or should i just
100:58 - remove it because it
100:59 - it looks for it doesn't even look like
101:01 - an iphone
101:03 - yeah it's not that great um i'm gonna
101:06 - i'm i mean we can we keep
101:08 - it yeah we'll keep it on our screen uh
101:10 - you know the shad screen
101:12 - all right i just removed that screen
101:16 - yeah now i'm gonna go ahead and check
101:19 - on the um
101:23 - text input right so now what we're gonna
101:25 - do is we're actually gonna capture some
101:26 - text right
101:28 - and then we're gonna go ahead and have
101:29 - like some kind of input
101:31 - build and do things like that so
101:33 - previously what we would have done in
101:35 - this sort of
101:36 - uh situation is we would have like an
101:37 - input and then this input would have
101:40 - like an
101:41 - unchanged and we'd call map it to state
101:43 - and then we'll
101:44 - have an enter key and stuff like that
101:45 - but in this case
101:47 - in react native we use something called
101:49 - a text input component
101:50 - okay this text input component we need
101:53 - to import it
101:55 - and then what we do is it takes some
101:58 - props right
101:59 - and then its own little custom prop so
102:01 - uh here what it has is it has a style it
102:03 - has a value
102:04 - so there's two things a value and it has
102:07 - something called
102:07 - on change text so typically
102:11 - we're used to unchange right but in
102:14 - react natives on change text so you see
102:15 - there's just small differences guys
102:18 - once you know these small differences
102:20 - it's really not that bad also
102:21 - bro we just hit over a thousand likes oh
102:25 -  that is amazing
102:30 - thank you guys so much for that and also
102:33 - we are actually at 265
102:35 - and donation that is huge thank you guys
102:38 - so much
102:41 - dollars 265 donation yeah dude that is
102:44 - the house absolutely nuts
102:47 - if you guys are enjoying this so far
102:49 - smash that like button so this video
102:50 - goes out to more and more people
102:52 - and we just hit 17 000 views
102:55 - on this yeah
102:58 - love that dude right so now on the
103:02 - unchanged text so previously we would
103:04 - have had e dot target dot set you know
103:06 - target dot value with that nasty stuff
103:08 - but in rank native it literally just
103:10 - gets the text right so we go ahead and
103:11 - say
103:11 - text and then we need to map it to
103:13 - something so
103:15 - we know about hooks in react right we
103:17 - know how to like this we can capture
103:19 - state and react
103:20 - so what we're going to do is we're going
103:21 - to say const and then we're going to
103:22 - have a value for the input field so
103:24 - we're going to say
103:26 - um value set input
103:29 - so we're just wanting a react okay and
103:30 - then we're going to say use state
103:32 - so this is what we're used to right
103:35 - and then this would be a placeholder
103:36 - here so i'm just going to say
103:38 - um let's say we don't even need a place
103:41 - so we're just going to keep it blank
103:42 - and then what we need to do is import
103:43 - this from react so this goes into
103:46 - literally as we normally
103:47 - understand and no react so we can say
103:50 - import from
103:51 - react there we go and i don't need this
103:54 - one
103:55 - so that's all good and then what we can
103:58 - do is
103:58 - we can go ahead and say uh
104:01 - on what are we working on right now by
104:04 - the way
104:05 - i'm just adding an input field now so
104:07 - we're having an input then
104:09 - so we can type in like something to do
104:12 - right
104:12 - yeah okay so i just
104:15 - and let me just visualize it here so
104:20 - cool something like this and then we
104:22 - just type in things and we'll add them
104:23 - as a to do
104:25 - exactly cool exactly so we're gonna have
104:28 - like some stuff there
104:29 - and then um so forth uh
104:32 - one sec dude um
104:34 - [Music]
104:38 - as far as my sister said i'm just live
104:40 - i'll call you in a sec
104:41 - okay so uh text input value input on
104:44 - change text
104:45 - set value okay there we go nice and then
104:47 - what we do is close this out
104:48 - save and now what we should see
104:52 - is should have an input field
104:56 - if we didn't break something so let's
104:58 - see how the input
104:59 - looks and i think what we need to do is
105:01 - actually set a style for this input
105:02 - field
105:03 - so we should see if it doesn't pop up
105:06 - okay we do have an input field but it's
105:08 - very small
105:09 - so right now you can't actually see it
105:12 - but it's actually if you click under eat
105:15 - code sleep
105:16 - yup eat code click under it okay yep
105:19 - there we go i see it
105:20 - yeah so you see that right so what we're
105:22 - going to do is that's so cool that i can
105:24 - actually use it on my phone
105:27 - yeah man and it will pop up your your
105:30 - text thing right
105:32 - yeah i can yeah i just typed in with my
105:34 - phone
105:35 - and i hit enter and it did it but what's
105:37 - cool is what i'm typing there isn't
105:39 - showing up here
105:42 - yeah that's literally like a running a
105:44 - separate instance on your phone
105:45 - nice perfect so here now what we're
105:49 - going to say is we're going to score
105:50 - this style
105:51 - let's just say it's the um and we're
105:54 - going to find we're going to use some
105:55 - kind of convention here
105:56 - afterwards but um for now let's go ahead
106:00 - and just call this
106:01 - uh to do input oh we just got another
106:04 - donation
106:05 - thank you so much bushetty
106:09 - says sunny kazi keep up the good work
106:11 - you guys make it so simple to understand
106:13 - i love that man
106:14 - thank you so much dude i just got an
106:17 - idea
106:17 - for building um uh instagram reel or a
106:20 - tick tock
106:21 - what if we screen recorded our
106:24 - everything that we're building
106:26 - right and then over a 30-second period
106:29 - so like imagine it's called let's build
106:31 - tinder or let's build tick-tock from
106:32 - scratch in 30 seconds
106:34 - and then it's just a time lapse of the
106:36 - code and the app being built out
106:38 - from start to finish
106:42 - i think it'll be dope man i think we
106:43 - should always be recording
106:46 - the it's been streaming you mean as in
106:49 - time lapse
106:49 - and just have the entire thing in like
106:51 - 30 seconds in a 30 second ig reel or a
106:53 - 30-second like
106:55 - or a 59-second tick-tock i feel like
106:57 - those will actually blow up and get like
106:59 - millions of views
107:01 - 100 that'll be insane because the thing
107:03 - would just be so quick like it'll be uh
107:05 - three hours in 50 seconds oh man let's
107:08 - do it
107:10 - so guys i added this in so we got to do
107:12 - input
107:13 - and then we say styles dot to do input
107:16 - and then we added a height of 40
107:18 - border color red and a border width of
107:20 - 1.
107:21 - save it we should if we didn't do
107:24 - anything wrong
107:25 - we should see yes now we got there
107:28 - we highlighted it right
107:32 - so what i'm going to do is give it a
107:34 - little bit of margin around it so i'm
107:35 - going to say margin of 20
107:38 - save and we should get a tiny bit of a
107:41 - margin around that now
107:44 - and that should go ahead and get that
107:46 - around us
107:47 - there we go so now we've got a little
107:48 - margin and what i want now is a button
107:50 - underneath it right
107:52 - so button and again for the button stuff
107:55 - i'm going to go ahead and
107:56 - give a check and guys this is what we're
107:59 - doing is we're literally just checking
108:01 - through the code
108:02 - the checking through how things work uh
108:05 - and an example code and then we're
108:06 - pretty much applying this
108:08 - the same principle and just doing it
108:09 - ourselves so for buttons
108:11 - um they actually are a self-closing
108:14 - component i think you can actually have
108:15 - another one but here we have a button
108:17 - the title of the button is going to be
108:19 - add to do yeah and then it has a
108:23 - special click um yeah 100 go ahead and
108:26 - text us
108:27 - and it's not a bot yeah exactly that's
108:29 - one thing dude that's one thing that i
108:31 - would hate right
108:32 - you know when people say text me and i'm
108:33 - like yeah but i really going to get
108:35 - through to them
108:36 - guys when you text that number you are
108:37 - going to get through to us
108:39 - yeah it's literally us and you can chat
108:40 - with us so it's like that's what i'm
108:42 - always skeptical about when i do it but
108:44 - it's not a bar it's us
108:46 - yeah which is awesome
108:49 - um okay so i had to do and now we're
108:52 - going to say
108:52 - we've got the title and then we're going
108:54 - to say let's just give it a color
108:56 - and leave the colors now we'll just say
108:59 - on press
109:00 - so on press right and now kazi what we
109:04 - want
109:04 - right is when you type in that you're
109:05 - going to type in that that that's
109:07 - of input field yeah and then
109:10 - on press right so when you press the
109:13 - button
109:14 - is underneath so right now you can't see
109:15 - a button so i'm going to go ahead and
109:16 - add the button in now
109:18 - so it should freak out because if we
109:20 - haven't imported the button so let's
109:21 - save it
109:24 - so now we should see a button
109:30 - underneath that in any second that we
109:32 - should see about
109:35 - um expo by the way joseph
109:40 - what was that joseph asked long time ago
109:44 - react cli or expo and i was just like
109:47 - oh that looks like a beautiful button
109:50 - man and it looks amazing on the mobile
109:51 - device too
109:54 - yeah now you got that
109:57 - gorgeous button with the clicking and
109:59 - then what we want is we want it
110:01 - to type like on the phone so check out
110:04 - the app on the phone guys
110:05 - and if you've scanned it you should be
110:07 - able to actually follow along with us
110:09 - yeah sick and this and the cool part
110:13 - is that's going to be the actual native
110:16 - button
110:17 - to an android that's going to be there
110:19 - ubuntu and ios
110:20 - so you see like it will actually look
110:22 - native to the platform that you're on
110:24 - so imagine when we click this we want to
110:25 - do something right so we're going to go
110:26 - ahead and do
110:28 - like an on press and then here i want to
110:30 - trigger off a function so you see it's
110:32 - very similar to
110:33 - like i haven't coded in react native in
110:35 - ages but it's very like intuitive
110:37 - right so let's just create a function
110:39 - called add to do
110:41 - and then this function all it's going to
110:43 - do now
110:45 - is it's going to go ahead and we're
110:46 - going to trigger this when we for the
110:48 - add to do function
110:49 - and we're just going to go ahead and say
110:53 - um and this should work we should say
110:56 - set
110:56 - input no we need a list of to do's
111:00 - so i'm going to create another variable
111:02 - we're going to call this one
111:03 - to do's set to do's and this is just
111:07 - going to be an empty array
111:09 - okay and then afterwards what we're
111:11 - going to do now is we're going to say
111:12 - set
111:13 - the to-do's to be whatever the current
111:17 - to-do's were
111:18 - so we're going to keep the to-do's and
111:20 - then i'm going to just push
111:22 - whatever we're writing right
111:25 - what was that and then whatever we type
111:28 - in the
111:28 - input field it'll append it to that
111:31 - array of to-do's
111:34 - exactly that and the reason why i'm
111:35 - putting it in front is that it comes at
111:37 - the top
111:38 - without much extra coding got it i'll
111:40 - pre-pend it
111:41 - yeah and then we pre-pend it up and then
111:44 - we do set input and i'm going to make
111:46 - this blank
111:46 - so that way it clears the input field
111:48 - now to be honest like
111:50 - i think i think that is literally the
111:52 - same that should work now
111:53 - before we go ahead and test this what
111:56 - i'm going to do is i'm going to render
111:57 - rather than having three
111:59 - stack things like this i'm just going to
112:01 - put a little
112:02 - map so i'm going to say to do this.map
112:04 - i'm going to say map through every
112:06 - single to do
112:07 - and return a to do and i love react
112:11 - because this is showing me like it just
112:13 - shows you how powerful this is like
112:14 - even when you're doing it with a native
112:17 - um
112:18 - platform so then you're gonna say to do
112:20 - like literally pretty much a react
112:21 - app yeah dude it's like you see what i
112:24 - mean like there's minor differences
112:27 - but like you literally go ahead and like
112:29 - oh
112:30 - it's so cool man yeah like and this is
112:32 - going to allow people to go ahead and
112:34 - build apps
112:34 - which is it's just really crazy like
112:37 - we're going to start seeing apps on the
112:38 - app store
112:39 - yeah that people have learned to code
112:41 - from us it's
112:42 - so cool that would be yeah that would
112:44 - actually be dope
112:46 - that would be yeah like guys if you go
112:48 - ahead and release any app at any point
112:50 - in time whether you're watching this
112:51 - video
112:52 - like a few months from now and you're
112:54 - watching a replay and you released an
112:55 - app make sure you let us know like on
112:58 - instagram or anything
113:00 - hit us up on instagram and and yeah go
113:02 - ahead and let us know that would be
113:04 - insane
113:05 - yeah so kazi now what we're going to do
113:07 - let's go ahead and
113:09 - save this file because for some reason
113:11 - it's not saving on my side
113:14 - okay so let's save it
113:17 - yeah and then it should hot reload
113:22 - okay oh nice bro
113:27 - that's dope right
113:30 - [Music]
113:32 - all right let's go um
113:35 - work out in the morning
113:39 - and uh we'll put a
113:42 - add to do we will then um
113:45 - eat 150 grams of protein
113:50 - and then thank um so much
113:54 - philip jones wonder donation appreciate
113:56 - that dude
113:59 - yo this is clean clean
114:04 - now dude can you can you already imagine
114:06 - right hook this up to five days
114:10 - make an app deploy it even for me and
114:12 - you
114:13 - tracking our stuff day to day yeah
114:16 - like we could literally go ahead and do
114:18 - it i'm so excited
114:22 - yes i'm so down for this bro like i can
114:25 - actually see this helping out
114:27 - i'm i'm writing this out in the
114:30 - on the mobile app and it's just such a
114:33 - cool experience
114:36 - come on focus
114:42 - hey look at that guys you see that
114:46 - it is actually it's actually a native
114:48 - app
114:49 - you see the keyboards popped up
114:51 - everything's there
114:52 - that's that's awesome man looks clean
114:58 - dude nobody does it like this right like
115:00 - even all the people who show you how to
115:02 - make apps and never even open up their
115:04 - iphone like to show you what it looks
115:06 - like they're just always coding on the
115:09 - exactly you just want to see the actual
115:11 - you know like
115:12 - it's always cool to see it like yeah um
115:15 - on a browser but actually see on a phone
115:18 - it's like okay it's tangible it's wrong
115:19 - you know
115:21 - yeah it's true also there is another
115:25 - thing
115:26 - called i remember that one
115:30 - um okay
115:33 - so you can also so a button is good
115:34 - right we all know a button does it
115:37 - it's just a clickable button uh you can
115:39 - also have something called touchable
115:40 - opacity
115:41 - um and that's something which i i've
115:43 - used before so imagine you wanted a
115:45 - clickable
115:46 - image or something instead you would go
115:48 - ahead and use something called
115:50 - um you would do this you would have
115:52 - something like this you'd have touchable
115:54 - how do we give it a key or pass
115:58 - how do we give it a key oh good show
115:59 - each other yeah so these ones
116:02 - yeah yeah if you want to give it a key
116:04 - do we just say
116:05 - equals something yeah so here you would
116:08 - just say key equals
116:10 - like this but in this case you would
116:13 - want to give it
116:14 - so it has to be a unique value so you
116:16 - could use a library called uuid
116:20 - um to generate random keys but in this
116:22 - case it's not i mean
116:24 - we're not really going through the
116:25 - performance side of things but what i
116:26 - would recommend is using
116:28 - uh a package called uuidv4 i think it's
116:33 - called can we use that one
116:34 - okay cool yeah that one you can pretty
116:37 - much go ahead and generate random keys
116:39 - for this
116:40 - i mean if you want to do a hacky way you
116:41 - can get the index but that's always a
116:43 - terrible way you're doing it you
116:44 - shouldn't really it's
116:45 - like it's frowned upon way of doing it
116:49 - um okay awesome so that's
116:53 - that's good um dude you know i want to
116:55 - sort of mess around with now so we've
116:57 - we've got already got to do that working
116:58 - right yeah now hooking up firebase and
117:01 - stuff is literally as simple as we've
117:02 - done it before
117:03 - except in this environment so we could
117:05 - do that but that's not going to really
117:06 - be
117:07 - as exciting at this point in time let's
117:09 - try and have a look at something like
117:12 - a status bar or you know like something
117:14 - native to
117:15 - a phone that we can kind of get working
117:20 - okay so let's just have a look on
117:25 - just looking right now at the
117:28 - react native docs so if you look at
117:30 - react native
117:31 - and the core component docs and we can
117:34 - pretty much go ahead and check our
117:38 - um like for example the nice thing with
117:41 - react native by the way dude is
117:43 - if you have a list right you know before
117:45 - you would have to have div and overflow
117:47 - and stuff like that now all you do is
117:49 - surround it in something called
117:51 - um a scroll view
117:55 - and the entire container becomes
117:56 - scrollable oh really
118:00 - are you serious yeah so you don't have
118:01 - to yes you just literally
118:03 - how do i do it rather than i just rap i
118:05 - just wrap all this in scroll view
118:08 - so not all of it so so whether where we
118:11 - map out the to-do's
118:12 - let's wrap that in something called a
118:14 - scroll view
118:15 - right and then what we'll do is we'll
118:17 - drop this down we'll go ahead and
118:20 - cut this paste it here um
118:24 - and we'll tab this in and now if we go
118:27 - ahead and all we need to do is import
118:28 - this
118:31 - save save save save save
118:36 - um there you go and now what we should
118:39 - see
118:40 - oh yeah you're right the the to
118:43 - do's are scrollable on my phone
118:45 - actually yeah so now if you add them so
118:49 - i'm just going to try and test one
118:59 - so you see that yeah scrollable which is
119:01 - nice
119:02 - so now like if you had a scrollable list
119:05 - that's all you need to do to get
119:06 - scrollable functionality
119:08 - um which is which is awesome yeah so you
119:10 - can use some reasons you can use
119:11 - flat list uses a recycler view for
119:14 - better performance
119:16 - so yeah you could use flat lift i'm
119:17 - looking at that now
119:19 - fully cross platform a performance
119:21 - interface for using
119:22 - okay yeah so flat list is something i
119:24 - would okay so i'd actually go ahead and
119:26 - maybe use the flat list instead then um
119:30 - that's pretty cool bro i can't
119:33 - wait to start building that freaking app
119:36 - bro when can we start building that app
119:37 - because i'm freaking getting hungry
119:41 - which one the uh the ps or the
119:45 - the internal could be it could be for
119:46 - anybody honestly
119:48 - um it could be for all students but
119:51 - something where
119:52 - we can just log like uh
119:55 - i mean workout would be fun too i was
119:57 - thinking one with freelancing where
119:59 - people can like log in
120:00 - how much income they made so for example
120:04 - that would be you know if i type in so
120:06 - like for example what i imagine right
120:07 - now
120:08 - is just a very simple version of it
120:10 - would be like
120:11 - if i typed in uh
120:15 - 150 here whoops
120:18 - 150 right here we just have this like
120:21 - uh internal dashboard here and then we
120:24 - can just see
120:25 - oh today all our students combined like
120:27 - we collectively generated 150 dollars
120:31 - yeah you know or if like multiple
120:33 - students put they made 150 then maybe
120:35 - you'll say like oh we made 300 dollars
120:37 - collectively at clever programmer
120:40 - yeah what we should do maybe then in
120:42 - that case we'll make a student app
120:44 - right make like a student app and push
120:47 - you on the app store
120:48 - and that one pretty much will have like
120:50 - a very nice interface they can pretty
120:51 - much go ahead and log
120:52 - their income attach like a picture to it
120:56 - yeah i would want it to be like with
120:57 - proof so for example it needs to be
121:00 - approved by somebody a clever programmer
121:02 - it can't just be like because because
121:05 - otherwise
121:05 - people will just start putting in like
121:07 - 50 million dollars you know they made
121:08 - this week
121:09 - so yeah with this they
121:12 - they will like put a picture proof and
121:14 - then somebody will just
121:16 - click approve and then it's good to go
121:19 - exactly
121:20 - devon gray says i could make that income
121:22 - logging up by tonight maybe a couple
121:24 - nights
121:24 - oh dude go for it i want to see
121:28 - that
121:28 - that'll be that's awesome nice little
121:30 - challenge yeah
121:31 - yeah that would be that would be really
121:33 - dope because i've always like
121:36 - dreamed about having something like this
121:37 - it'd be so cool to have students in one
121:40 - place
121:42 - log their things be able to see it have
121:44 - clear-cut direction of what to do
121:46 - and see collectively that there are
121:48 - other students just like them making an
121:49 - income and you know how like venmo makes
121:51 - it
121:52 - visible to you like yeah other people
121:55 - paying each other you know it's like oh
121:57 - this guy just
121:58 - paid um somebody like
122:01 - 10 bucks you know yeah i wanted to be
122:04 - like that where
122:05 - eventually you can see the avatar of
122:07 - other students and it's like oh this guy
122:09 - just made 500
122:10 - freelancing on like a upwork project or
122:12 - something
122:13 - yeah that would be awesome man like a
122:15 - leaderboard style like gamify
122:17 - so it's like it inspires you oh recent
122:19 - activity you know like
122:21 - uh this person just made 30 bucks from
122:24 - coding
122:25 - yeah you're like oh i think we
122:26 - should come man that'd be sick and dude
122:28 - you know what's so
122:29 - cool is that the we could have this app
122:32 - built in react native
122:33 - and then the admin app to go ahead and
122:36 - improve and and reject
122:37 - based on the the evidence as people give
122:39 - us yes that could be on a react app
122:42 - just for us oh yeah that's true yeah
122:46 - which we deploy using firebase i mean
122:49 - the whole thing can be done with the
122:50 - react native because
122:52 - i would want the students to be able to
122:53 - use the app to log their activity
122:56 - no they would but then for us as in
122:58 - would you say would you want
123:00 - us to go ahead and do it i mean it could
123:01 - be another we could use it fast as well
123:04 - yeah i mean what are you saying so like
123:06 - react native for the students and react
123:08 - native for us too right for the
123:09 - dashboard side
123:11 - so you could i'm saying you can either
123:12 - do react native or the benefit i would
123:15 - say
123:15 - is have a react native app for the
123:17 - students to log in yeah
123:18 - and then for us as the admin because we
123:20 - would want to not only be able to do it
123:22 - on our phone
123:23 - yeah but also be able to on a desktop
123:25 - yeah
123:27 - so so if you build it in react as a pwa
123:30 - then you can install the pwa on your
123:33 - phone as an
123:33 - app so using react oh so we
123:37 - would have the full we would have a full
123:39 - app using react
123:40 - students would have a react native app
123:42 - available in the app store yeah and you
123:43 - see like
123:44 - crazy right that would be that would be
123:47 - awesome dude that would be awesome
123:51 - benefit of that way is that okay this is
123:53 - something which is actually really
123:54 - valuable also carving commander uh
123:56 - commander thank you dude
123:58 - for care canadian ten dollar donation he
124:00 - says running out of
124:01 - words for this massive value you guys
124:03 - are killing it super pumped for reacting
124:05 - even appreciate this very much keep it
124:06 - going
124:07 - let's go thank you so much calvin always
124:09 - coming in strong
124:10 - appreciate you did thank you
124:14 - that is awesome brother appreciate it
124:17 - yeah so because this is something which
124:20 - uh is is really actually
124:22 - like a quite an important advisor
124:24 - whenever you make
124:25 - an app right so imagine we deployed an
124:28 - app to the app store
124:29 - it has an approval process
124:32 - which means that like you know that when
124:33 - you code an app in react yes you can
124:35 - just pretty much hit firebase deploy and
124:37 - the things
124:38 - up like and it's live yeah yeah
124:41 - literally in seconds i think it's live
124:43 - yeah but if you do an app in react
124:44 - native
124:45 - you need to remember that if you need to
124:46 - bundle the app get everything ready
124:48 - get like the sort of the thumbnail and
124:50 - everything ready for the the app store
124:52 - stuff
124:53 - submitted to the app store for a year
124:55 - yeah and then there's a process
124:56 - to get that version out yeah
125:00 - right so what you would want is you need
125:03 - so so for for the admin side of things
125:04 - you want the constant
125:06 - updating and then you have to increase
125:08 - the sort of you know the views and stuff
125:10 - that we can see
125:11 - for the students we want it to be very
125:13 - controlled so that they can only see and
125:15 - this is really important for you guys
125:16 - because
125:17 - if you're pretty much going thinking
125:18 - about do i need a react app or react
125:20 - native app
125:21 - things didn't like that that you have to
125:23 - start considering yeah
125:24 - so in our case if we were to build this
125:26 - app react native is the way for the
125:28 - students
125:29 - but a react app is the way forward for
125:31 - yeah like
125:32 - us to go ahead and review it see things
125:35 - approve reject yeah oh um
125:39 - jason just said jason is like devin
125:42 - to be honest i'm in the mode for a react
125:45 - project i'd be super down to work on it
125:47 - with you if you're free so they're
125:48 - actually thinking about teaming up on
125:49 - this that's sick
125:50 - and let me see marabon let's go
125:55 - beautiful girlfriend is in the house
125:58 - because love you
125:59 - you guys are smashing it honestly it's
126:01 - it's fun man it's fun being back on
126:03 - on live together yeah those dance videos
126:06 - are sick
126:07 - like i love seeing them whenever they're
126:09 - on like but
126:10 - i don't know she puts like one story in
126:11 - a week of the dance but
126:14 - more of those stories like i i love
126:16 - seeing those because it gets me hyped up
126:17 - i love when people are good at something
126:19 - and then they do it and it's like
126:21 - gets you riled up yeah
126:24 - she's mowing man she she pushes for it
126:27 - yeah
126:28 - um the app store isn't harsh on the
126:31 - approval
126:32 - the app store isn't harsh so jason
126:35 - francis this actually
126:36 - he says the app store isn't harsh on the
126:38 - approval process it took me two days
126:40 - to get my react native app approved rack
126:42 - uses niagara
126:43 - okay so very important thing to mention
126:47 - here
126:47 - it is pretty strict on the approval
126:50 - process trust me like when you get to
126:51 - the apps which are more complicated
126:54 - they can really be a pain sometimes to
126:56 - approve your apps it really depends what
126:58 - your app does
126:59 - so like if you have some kind of like
127:01 - they like it they just get a bit
127:03 - annoying with things so so yeah
127:05 - and uh maiwan says yes she goes i'll
127:07 - post more yeah that's
127:08 - it dude that's it man well positivity
127:10 - that's it to push for it more
127:12 - content for everyone
127:15 - um okay awesome so
127:19 - so okay so cool so in terms of
127:22 - doing that i mean i'm pretty excited to
127:25 - even like
127:26 - build really simple versions of it even
127:28 - if we want to start out with the
127:30 - like our own version of fitness or
127:33 - something i'm down for that too like
127:34 - where we can just
127:36 - drop notes on our workouts the day
127:38 - before but it's like
127:39 - shareable that would be cool or we can
127:41 - just start working on the other project
127:44 - which one do you want to like
127:46 - start with so i think
127:50 - we already have a really strong approach
127:52 - that's working for us we're tracking
127:54 - fitness at the moment
127:55 - um and for anyone who is interested in
127:57 - that we in qazi
127:58 - and rachel and our team use something
128:00 - called done and we track
128:02 - our workouts from that so it works
128:04 - really well for us right now so i think
128:06 - the one that's going to bring everyone
128:07 - the most value is that tracking app so
128:11 - what would be awesome dude is to break
128:12 - down the app together
128:14 - yeah figure out that we're going to need
128:16 - navigation we're going to need a
128:17 - database we're going to need
128:18 - authentication and build the entire
128:21 - thing out
128:22 - together yeah and then we build a back
128:24 - end bit for the admin
128:25 - that'd be dope that would be really cool
128:28 - i mean that is a project
128:30 - i'm really excited to work on and who
128:31 - knows it might take us
128:33 - two three weeks of continuous work
128:36 - but i think that will just just
128:38 - personally you and i that will get us
128:40 - excited as
128:42 - so yeah it'll give us something to work
128:44 - towards every day
128:46 - yeah and we would definitely like not
128:48 - stop until the thing was
128:51 - built out properly and released in the
128:53 - app store
128:54 - that's true yeah yeah so what do you say
128:57 - you want to get started on that
128:59 - yeah so sonic king says would we be able
129:01 - to see the process
129:02 - oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah you guys will
129:05 - be able to see the entire process from
129:07 - from um scratch okay cool
129:11 - so uh let's maybe
129:14 - do something with it even if it's tiny
129:16 - right now if you're down
129:19 - let's do it dude let's actually so
129:22 - let's think about what we're gonna need
129:25 - um
129:27 - some kind of navigation
129:30 - inside of the app right so i'm just
129:32 - checking something quickly
129:34 - can we start with just this like
129:36 - literally can we start with just this
129:38 - where if
129:38 - you can put in 150 like 150
129:42 - and i can put in like let's look at
129:43 - almost like a to-do list
129:46 - but just for numbers so it's like if i
129:48 - put in 150 and then i put another 150
129:50 - it just gives you a 300. like it
129:53 - literally just sums up
129:55 - that i think would be a really good
129:57 - start
129:58 - let's do it okay so um
130:02 - right so so we want two input fields and
130:04 - then it would just sum it up at the
130:05 - bottom
130:06 - yeah yeah okay so we can do that
130:09 - very nicely actually dynamically no it
130:11 - should just have a one it should have
130:13 - just one
130:14 - input field and then every time you
130:17 - enter an amount in there and hit add
130:19 - amount or something
130:20 - or add income it keeps adding it to the
130:23 - total
130:24 - okay so let's do that so maybe maybe
130:28 - let's have two input fields one which
130:30 - says
130:31 - um what did you what work did you do
130:35 - and then and another one which is how
130:36 - much did you make got it okay so like a
130:38 - descriptive field of what you did and
130:40 - hum then the other one is like how much
130:42 - you
130:42 - made okay love that okay that's cool
130:44 - that's cool i can go with that
130:46 - yeah yeah so right now we don't need the
130:48 - to-do.js so we're going to get rid of
130:50 - the scroll view for now
130:52 - uh the view here we can keep the text
130:54 - input we're just going to copy this
130:55 - because we're going to have two text
130:56 - inputs now
130:58 - um the style we can keep for now very
131:00 - simple
131:01 - we're going to need two input fields one
131:03 - is going to be for the description
131:05 - so here we're just going to go ahead and
131:06 - we're going to get rid of this add to do
131:08 - button
131:09 - and then here we're going to comment out
131:10 - this one and
131:12 - we're going to go ahead and say we need
131:14 - to we're going to need description
131:16 - and we're going to do set description
131:18 - because that's a nice little
131:20 - standard that you should stick with and
131:22 - then we're going to copy that
131:24 - the next one is going to be the let's
131:26 - call it the
131:28 - um amount right and then you just set
131:30 - amount
131:32 - amount and this amount by default will
131:34 - be
131:36 - zero and then we're gonna have rather
131:38 - than a list of to-do's
131:40 - we're gonna have a um
131:43 - [Music]
131:45 - what would you call it like the list of
131:47 - of all the
131:48 - jobs yeah list of
131:51 - incomes list of jobs let me think
131:56 - like that list is going to be because it
131:58 - could be a task
132:00 - it's almost like an um income entry or
132:02 - something or entry
132:04 - yeah like an entry entries all right
132:07 - yeah
132:08 - sounds um kind of nasty but i'll keep
132:11 - thinking about it
132:18 - logs no that
132:22 - that sounds worse you could just do
132:25 - entries for now i think that's pretty
132:26 - good
132:28 - yes oh list of gigs that's cool
132:32 - what's up like enter your gig that's
132:34 - kind of cool enter your gig
132:37 - yeah that's actually pretty cool
132:41 - um i got that idea from um somebody who
132:44 - just wrote it down
132:46 - calvin calvin yeah yeah he actually
132:49 - donated earlier as well
132:50 - awesome um sons of king says let's
132:53 - try look at this teamwork we're watching
132:55 - steve jobs and steve wozniak
132:57 - let's go brave baby
133:01 - nice gigs
133:05 - yeah let's do gigs let's go with gigs
133:07 - yeah
133:08 - so gigs that gigs
133:11 - okay and now your gigs will pretty much
133:14 - be
133:15 - um and just to sort of draft our imagine
133:18 - one gig right it would have
133:19 - a description and the
133:23 - one in the description could be like the
133:25 - freelance like freelance
133:27 - job with kazi and the amount
133:31 - could be something like 499.99 that's
133:34 - what we made
133:35 - right so that's going to be one of the
133:37 - objects inside okay
133:39 - and then we're going to have um
133:42 - microsoft to do
133:43 - app just like copied wunderlist so hard
133:48 - yeah i think i saw that was it called
133:50 - this cooldown oh did they buy
133:52 - wunderlist bro and changed it to
133:53 - microsoft to do
133:55 - because like wunderlist it looks
133:58 - yeah they must have done that because
134:00 - now when you look up wunderlist it
134:01 - doesn't show up at all
134:04 - they probably didn't wouldn't be
134:05 - surprised god damn it
134:08 - so now we're going to change this one to
134:10 - the description this one to the
134:12 - amount and this will be set amount so
134:15 - here we set
134:16 - amount like this and now we don't want
134:19 - this to be
134:19 - uh the text input so text input is cool
134:23 - but i wonder what's the best way to have
134:25 - like a number
134:26 - input because text input is all right
134:29 - but we want like a
134:30 - the native number picker to come up on
134:32 - the phone
134:33 - so i think what we would be looking for
134:37 - is um
134:42 - change like a type of text input
134:45 - so i'm just going to type all we should
134:47 - get to today is like literally
134:49 - get to one bare bones graph
134:52 - like a bar graph yep um if possible and
134:56 - then the rest is just like
134:58 - summing up to that one amount yeah
135:02 - let's do it a bare bones wait a number
135:05 - did you say oh graph yeah i mean we can
135:09 - get started with the number i think
135:10 - that's great as a bonus if we could just
135:13 - get a graph that like a bar graph so
135:15 - whatever number you put in it just has a
135:17 - bar
135:17 - graph that represents that total sum
135:21 - but if that is like too much then we can
135:23 - just do that tomorrow or something but
135:25 - like i think
135:26 - working towards this app dude we'll be
135:28 - so sick because it's like
135:29 - actually real and something exciting for
135:31 - us too
135:32 - yes yeah man exactly so if we had a
135:36 - keyboard type
135:37 - right that's the one that we're looking
135:38 - for numeric or number there is actually
135:40 - another one called
135:41 - some numeric so cars on your phone right
135:44 - now
135:45 - um for numeric is that is that there is
135:48 - a good keypad so
135:50 - to get so let me save this safe decision
135:54 - what to say are you talking about oh
135:56 - check your feet let me see okay
135:58 - and check the the so both of them oh
136:01 - this one shouldn't be numeric
136:02 - epic
136:07 - that's exactly what i wanted yeah so
136:10 - well it doesn't have decimal points does
136:12 - it
136:13 - i can add decimals at the bottom is
136:16 - there a dot
136:17 - yeah you see a dog yeah at the bottom
136:19 - can't you everything oh no okay
136:21 - okay it's
136:21 - just like faint on my screen okay
136:23 - perfect yeah you can add decimals
136:26 - perfect so then we've got that on the
136:28 - bottom one so the bottom one is going to
136:29 - be keyboard type numeric
136:31 - so that way we know how to go ahead and
136:33 - get that and then the top one is going
136:34 - to be this
136:36 - and then what we're going to do is i
136:38 - think they also have placeholder here so
136:39 - let's go ahead and type in placeholder
136:41 - let's see if we enter a description
136:45 - maybe if they've got a placeholder you
136:47 - should get the placeholder from that
136:50 - let me just type in yeah we have got
136:52 - placeholder and guys if you're wondering
136:53 - how i i found all that
136:55 - literally i'm on the docs react name and
136:57 - i just did control command
136:58 - f and i'm just typing in placeholder and
137:00 - seeing if it if it pops
137:01 - up um so there we go so enter a
137:04 - description landed a client
137:07 - um and then the second one would be
137:10 - yeah so we could just say i wonder if we
137:12 - could do and this one's our placeholder
137:14 - equals enter
137:17 - the amount you made
137:21 - save i wonder if because it's zero i
137:23 - don't think you'll show
137:29 - okay so i think what we need to do
137:32 - instead is make this
137:34 - um actually blank
137:37 - and save that see if that comes up
137:43 - nice yep you made awesome
137:46 - all right and we can also maybe say in
137:48 - dollars or something yeah
137:49 - um you know so something like in dollars
137:54 - there we go all right so then we've got
137:56 - the enter description to the amount you
137:58 - made
137:58 - and then some kind of button so a button
138:00 - at the bottom which would say
138:02 - um uh
138:05 - uh add i guess or add add
138:09 - add gig or submit gig or add gig
138:19 - so title and then here would be rather
138:22 - than add to you just say
138:23 - gig that's actually a really cool add
138:25 - gig
138:26 - yeah right then we're going to have add
138:28 - gig and then this one is going to be an
138:30 - arrow function
138:31 - and all this is going to do is when you
138:33 - hit add gig
138:35 - it should go ahead and and you set gigs
138:40 - to whatever was inside of gigs unless
138:42 - it's going to be
138:43 - an array still so it's an array still
138:47 - it's going to be whatever's inside the
138:48 - gigs plus a new object
138:51 - which has a description
138:54 - of our description that we typed in
138:57 - can you imagine bro can you imagine
139:01 - 20 30 days from now consistent work
139:04 - on this app and 20 30 days from now
139:08 - imagine the whole thing is completely
139:10 - done
139:11 - everybody was there alongside us as we
139:14 - built every single part of this out and
139:16 - then we hit
139:17 - publish to the app store and everybody
139:20 - just goes to the app store
139:22 - and goes wild on this dude
139:26 - crazy right can you imagine that dude
139:28 - that'll be everyone would be like
139:30 - just um that'll be fun dude and it would
139:33 - be so awesome because
139:35 - every time yeah just oh man
139:38 - is like funny i feel like we should just
139:40 - go to l.a
139:42 - yeah like sonny i feel like we should
139:44 - just go to l.a yeah
139:45 - we should honestly we really do man we
139:47 - need to come to l.a
139:51 - so to do input so we're going to change
139:54 - this to do input
139:56 - sorry you can finish your thought you
139:58 - were you were saying something
140:01 - um no no i'm saying so uh when we
140:04 - actually
140:04 - like guys like we there's so many people
140:07 - are making money
140:09 - and and and it's so hard to keep track
140:11 - of that number
140:13 - like and this and this is true actually
140:15 - remember guys i can't believe you
140:16 - haven't met each other in person
140:18 - it's insane dude yeah when you think
140:19 - about it like
140:20 - [Laughter]
140:22 - how much we've done and we've never
140:25 - actually shook
140:26 - hands like it's insane oh sure bro
140:29 - what's the roi
140:31 - of us using skype and zoom
140:34 - i know right when the next person's next
140:36 - time someone tells me you can't work as
140:38 - effective
140:39 - in in like over remote work and be like
140:42 - shut the up yeah
140:44 - but dude i mean in person would be like
140:46 - at a whole another level dude that'd be
140:49 - insane
140:51 - then we have to record that we'll get
140:53 - like a whole vlog
140:54 - when we do that yeah
140:57 - yeah man um so now we've got this and
141:02 - add gig does that so now it should go
141:03 - ahead and
141:04 - and do description amount okay awesome
141:06 - so that should set the gig and what we
141:07 - want to do is after you submit the gig
141:10 - you want to go i like that gig that's
141:12 - pretty cool
141:13 - yeah i really like that yeah set
141:16 - description we're going to
141:17 - reset that back to zero and as i'm gonna
141:20 - go blank and we're gonna say set amount
141:22 - back to blank as well what should we
141:24 - call this app by the way guys so
141:26 - we'll take some name suggestions because
141:27 - you guys have much better suggestions
141:29 - than us to be honest
141:31 - yeah go ahead and let us know guys
141:36 - um qazi also we want to protect against
141:40 - them
141:40 - clicking add gig before it's
141:43 - um it's right it's uh so the
141:46 - value yeah or whatever
141:49 - yeah like if you if you if you haven't
141:51 - got um
141:53 - an amount or a description you need both
141:55 - to be able to click add gig
141:58 - so to do that go to disabled
142:01 - here so you see here where it says
142:03 - button and they should have disabled so
142:06 - i'm going to just double check so button
142:08 - looking at the docks and we see this ron
142:10 - is like you're both going to cry sonny
142:11 - will jump
142:12 - on you i
142:15 - will dude it's just
142:18 - jump and i just hold oh slow-mo
142:22 - music's worth spitting around
142:23 - [Laughter]
142:26 - literally you just see aaron running
142:28 - behind frankie comes lighting him
142:30 - you just see like amberly and like
142:32 - mirrorbot in slow-mo like
142:35 - what the and then nas just like
142:39 - dances over
142:42 - everybody just like disgusted with this
142:45 - music playing in the background
142:48 - like sunny man i'll be waiting
142:50 - for this
142:54 - that'll be quite a day oh god god damn
142:57 - quran
143:01 - lettie corona rs man disabled
143:05 - if if there is no amount
143:09 - and there is no description
143:12 - so now it should be once i saved this
143:16 - oh my gosh that's cool
143:22 - nice now it's disabled i see that
143:26 - boom awesome why is there an
143:29 - uh a button like how the button looks
143:32 - here looks pretty cool it doesn't
143:34 - show like that on the mobile device but
143:36 - i mean it's it's not that big of a deal
143:37 - we don't have to worry about that right
143:38 - now
143:39 - we can just focus on this for now
143:42 - what was that if there's a the button
143:46 - that looks how it looks here it doesn't
143:49 - look like that on the mobile device
143:50 - it does the buttons here yeah so the
143:53 - reason being dude
143:54 - is because this is the one on the mobile
143:57 - device
143:58 - is native to ios so what you would even
144:01 - have to do is style it
144:03 - so that it's going to be consistent
144:04 - across all the platforms but by default
144:06 - the button component renders to
144:08 - the um component that's on ios
144:11 - or the components on android on ios is
144:14 - the full android button
144:15 - uh ios one on android android
144:18 - got it so we got some cool ones we got
144:21 - my gig tracker we got gig flow
144:26 - gig flow oh nice yeah
144:29 - all right cool so now we're gonna do
144:32 - yeah
144:32 - go ahead so we have everything
144:35 - essentially added in right so like it
144:37 - should be kind of there like it should
144:39 - be inside of our state
144:41 - um and to test it we just want to render
144:43 - it out just to quickly have a little
144:45 - test so
144:46 - imagine we added our stuff in and then
144:48 - underneath all of this
144:50 - let's just go ahead and say gigs.map
144:53 - for every gig we should render out
144:57 - oops it's total very good
145:00 - uh so so we actually first you want to
145:02 - we want to show the
145:04 - the gig now oh
145:07 - oh yeah true true true the total maybe
145:11 - because if we put it at the top
145:12 - total yeah yeah yeah it would have the
145:16 - total at the top like you know the total
145:18 - would rack up at the top and then
145:19 - underneath maybe a scrollable list of
145:21 - the gigs
145:22 - that's perfect yeah yeah
145:25 - so something like that and then we can
145:26 - say like the gig dot description
145:29 - and what we could do here is we can
145:31 - actually you know we'll keep it like
145:32 - this as i'll show you after this we can
145:34 - pick the description gig dot amount
145:37 - and then dollar sign here
145:41 - um capital t for the that one yeah there
145:44 - you go
145:45 - and say this
145:51 - okay so by default it should already
145:54 - have one pre-populated
145:56 - that we should be able to see
146:00 - indie gig in the devs
146:03 - yeah so you see it says freelance job
146:04 - with kazi if i go ahead and say
146:07 - um youtube with sunny
146:11 - uh let's just type in 349 or something
146:14 - add gig
146:15 - boom youtube is sunny 3.9 okay
146:18 - i hope it works so if you now type in
146:20 - the description and an amount
146:21 - it will push to that list at the bottom
146:23 - now oh
146:25 - nice so go ahead and give it a try
146:29 - oh that's sick that is really cool yeah
146:33 - it did
146:35 - don't you see it uh there's a screen
146:37 - mice i don't know why
146:38 - my screen share is a bit slow behind but
146:40 - i'm looking at the feed as well
146:42 - okay dope nice so now
146:46 - what we can do is um so there's a really
146:48 - elegant way of doing this but i always
146:50 - forget so i'm going to show you guys
146:51 - what i end up having to go through every
146:52 - time i do this
146:54 - um oh nice landing clown that worked for
146:56 - 25 dollars an hour did they ours work
146:58 - from 200 though
147:00 - um see even dude like even getting to
147:03 - this point is like it's very like
147:05 - light but it's so powerful because yeah
147:07 - that's what i'm saying
147:08 - yeah we're not far from like
147:12 - the layout to the road is there you know
147:15 - like we know exactly how to get there
147:16 - now
147:17 - yeah like literally this is it like
147:19 - we're almost done
147:21 - with what we're looking for because i
147:24 - want to see
147:24 - this and see how students are doing like
147:28 - at a glance
147:30 - yeah and like within pwg we can make
147:33 - this a thing that like everybody
147:35 - tracks yeah exactly
147:40 - so now what we're gonna do is we're
147:43 - going to go ahead and
147:45 - make it i'm just going to add margin top
147:48 - um
147:48 - so what are you doing the elegant thing
147:50 - is that supposed to be the
147:53 - um oh so i was going to do a reduce
147:56 - to sum it up right so yeah to sum it so
147:59 - you see this
148:00 - this uh total income here um so you
148:03 - could do it
148:03 - i mean there's there's many ways you can
148:05 - do this right um
148:07 - but what we're going to have is every
148:08 - time the um uh the gig
148:10 - basically let's go ahead and say let's
148:13 - have a piece of state called total
148:15 - right and this is just going to be
148:17 - responsible for the total so we're just
148:18 - going
148:19 - we're going to prepare that piece of
148:20 - state now there's so many ways you can
148:23 - do this but the total in the beginning
148:24 - is going to be zero right
148:26 - now we're going to have a use effect and
148:29 - i know what you're thinking like
148:30 - it seems like overkill man why would you
148:32 - have a user effect like
148:34 - that there's a reason being is because
148:35 - this is it's called decoupled code when
148:38 - you code it like this
148:39 - then imagine we was to plug in like a
148:41 - database and stuff like that
148:42 - it's it will just work for the future if
148:45 - we build it this way
148:46 - yeah so like it may seem like
148:48 - far-fetched but it just means that
148:49 - whenever the gigs change
148:50 - recalculate the total which is exactly
148:52 - what you would want if you think about
148:54 - it
148:54 - every time the gigs change you want to
148:57 - recalculate the total
148:58 - right right so what we can say now is
149:01 - you can say gigs
149:02 - dot reduce and i need to always double
149:04 - check i mean i
149:05 - i always forget how to do a reduce off
149:07 - my heart but once i get it right it's
149:09 - amazing the thing so
149:11 - reduce is
149:17 - so a reduce would be
149:20 - give me gig should have a timeline so
149:23 - each person can see like a track history
149:26 - of the gig
149:28 - that could
149:31 - i see what they're saying so each
149:33 - basically like
149:34 - you can click within the gig and then
149:36 - like go and add to it
149:39 - um each one
149:45 - one sec let's do the reduce and then
149:47 - wait wait so he said each gig should
149:49 - have a timeline
149:50 - i see what each person can see like oh i
149:53 - see
149:54 - yeah because because what and
149:58 - like actual entry is different than a
150:01 - gig
150:01 - right like gig is actual like for
150:03 - example if you land a gig
150:05 - with yeah right then you go you keep
150:08 - going into that gig and keep
150:09 - okay right now we don't even need to add
150:11 - that fanciness we can add that as a next
150:13 - step
150:15 - right now we just need brute force
150:18 - logging and income
150:21 - yeah exactly the total
150:25 - i love what amar is saying by the way so
150:27 - i'm gonna like
150:28 - screenshot all the feedback that he's
150:30 - giving us and then
150:33 - uh we can actually go through it later
150:35 - but like it's actually pretty smart
150:38 - so he's even giving examples you see
150:40 - them on my screen
150:43 - like he's like example on january 2 i
150:47 - listed on fiverr then on january 5
150:49 - someone found me and then on january 20
150:51 - i delivered it so
150:52 - that's pretty cool i'm just gonna yeah
150:56 - it could be useful yeah
151:00 - is actually really smart to build an
151:03 - app together with people because you're
151:04 - getting live feedback so you're gonna
151:07 - build a great app this way
151:11 - exactly now let me explain this snippet
151:15 - to you
151:15 - and then we can go ahead and i'll show
151:17 - you how to make this even more elegant
151:18 - but
151:19 - you see this reduce right yeah assuming
151:21 - i've done it all right i mean
151:23 - to me it's just like
151:27 - and that says so what you're doing here
151:28 - is and this is what you can even make
151:30 - this
151:30 - so damn elegant so it's to the point of
151:32 - like this right so now
151:35 - is this total a variable that i can uh
151:38 - put
151:38 - like can i use that total right here
151:41 - sunny
151:43 - yes you can make that there and this
151:45 - rather than saying i'm
151:47 - making a little variable here you can
151:49 - just go ahead and say set total
151:51 - and what we're doing here so you can
151:52 - remove should i remove that line
151:54 - okay cool oh nice that looks elegant
151:58 - uh use another that should be defined
152:00 - use effect you have to import it
152:03 - oh yeah good job um reduce is one of
152:06 - those ones guys like even
152:08 - even after coding for the ocean
152:12 - you did um it's one of those things
152:14 - where like even after coding for ages
152:16 - you just forget like you you forget how
152:18 - to do the thing and then
152:19 - you just you quickly check up an example
152:21 - and you're like okay that's how i do it
152:23 - so now look at that dude total income
152:25 - 4.99 right
152:26 - now go ahead and add something
152:35 - holy bro what is this oh
152:38 - okay so that's what we do that's where
152:40 - the issue comes so now
152:42 - you see here it's total plus gig
152:45 - right so what it's doing is it's
152:47 - treating it as a string
152:49 - it's streaming as a string yeah wait
152:52 - because amount
152:53 - because the amount is a string what the
152:56 -  is this yes
152:58 - it's changed to you can change that to a
153:00 - zero but the reason why
153:01 - we want that as a zero is because um so
153:05 - you can cast
153:06 - it like that but um what you what you
153:09 - want to use is number
153:10 - so you actually use the number with a
153:11 - capital n
153:15 - that's it and then i think the total
153:19 - the total should buy the so total the
153:21 - initial value you define here so you see
153:23 - this value here
153:24 - let's go i don't need no react
153:30 - let's do it and that's sick all right
153:33 - dope
153:34 - nice and then what we can say is um
153:37 - total income just add the dollar sign
153:39 - before it
153:40 - and you'll get that
153:44 - um what you might run into in some
153:46 - corner cases which i've definitely ran
153:48 - into before
153:49 - is where you have um you add like
153:53 - a decimal in this case we're just doing
153:55 - adding but when you do times
153:57 - income amounts you should use a library
153:59 - to handle displaying a currency
154:01 - because otherwise you'll get like 0.947
154:04 - and
154:05 - you know like it should be even i know
154:07 - it sounds simple to round that round
154:08 - down
154:09 - but you will get corner cases where that
154:10 -  just goes crazy
154:12 - um all right okay
154:15 - good job now uh this as for styling
154:19 - this can be uh go ahead and and whatever
154:22 - is after
154:23 - it as it seems oh nice devin gray says
154:26 - total equals zero or whatever is after
154:27 - the comma if added is assumed to be zero
154:29 - yeah so that's right if we add it to be
154:32 - here it'll be zero if we don't add that
154:34 - i think you're right i think by default
154:36 - it would fall to zero
154:37 - yo sonny i'm gonna install this uh
154:41 - charge yeah okay let's
154:45 - getting good downloads every week so it
154:48 - looks good
154:50 - should we get it yeah yeah i'm just
154:53 - having a
154:54 - oh it's got some beautiful
154:56 - beautiful
154:57 - that's what i'm saying it's looking
154:59 - great in the date yes that's
155:01 - good dude i'm getting so excited
155:04 - because i'll be able to start logging in
155:06 - my income today on it so i'm actually
155:09 - getting
155:10 -  excited about it because nothing
155:12 - like this exists
155:15 - exactly okay
155:19 - uh yeah let's give this a try import
155:22 - so let's import this we need to mpm
155:26 - uh npm in store um
155:29 - react native chart kit i did
155:33 - i installed oh you didn't install it
155:35 - okay
155:37 - um hold on why does it keep
155:45 - all right there we go so bar chart and
155:48 - then
155:48 - um you create a view
155:52 - and um holy this looks complicated
155:58 - so we want we want a line chart right so
156:00 - what i would say is
156:02 - literally just i don't wanna i don't
156:04 - want a line chart i just want
156:06 - a i want a
156:09 - bar chart actually but i did copy
156:13 - whoa whoa whoa where did i go wrong i
156:15 - thought i did everything perfectly
156:20 - wait you copied the entire thing right
156:22 - yeah the whole view
156:24 - or should i just copy it from the text
156:27 - um no you can copy the whole view so
156:28 - what we'll do is we'll we'll pull this
156:30 - forward
156:31 - so the indentation always makes it
156:33 - easier so we can that's good
156:34 - and now it's freaking out over what it's
156:37 - saying let's just check the error
156:39 - so save this compile and
156:42 - so we might have some can't resolve
156:44 - react native svg so maybe let's just
156:46 - remove
156:48 - wherever we have oh no that this also
156:51 - could be
156:52 - um because really of svg do we did do it
156:54 - right we did do an install we did react
156:56 - native chart kit
156:57 - but i don't think we did react native
156:59 - svg did oh we have to do that
157:02 - yeah so there's two there you see that
157:04 - install the pair dependencies so
157:06 - um npm i react native svg
157:12 - like that dash yeah svg okay
157:16 - dude i'm not i'm getting excited
157:18 - bro this is sick
157:21 - i love it man because i feel like we're
157:23 - going to start building some actual
157:24 - efforts
157:25 - [Applause]
157:29 - dude i'm getting in my like now i'm
157:31 -  hyped for this you know
157:34 - yeah so sick
157:38 - okay so uh also so i saw yes so somebody
157:41 - wrote
157:41 - link i saw a link in a comment right you
157:44 - don't need to do that anymore
157:46 - so whoever if you ever come across
157:48 - linking dependencies you don't need to
157:50 - do that
157:50 - just stay away from that stuff trust me
157:52 - um what is happening okay
157:55 - so now line chart is not defined okay
157:57 - that's a good sign
157:58 - because now it's uh we need to import
158:02 - that first date it just did it
158:05 - nice
158:09 - i can feel my brain engaging with
158:11 - everything now dimension is not
158:15 - what what's the same line
158:18 - this dimension is not defined dimensions
158:23 - um it's getting dimensions from reaction
158:26 - native so i can actually
158:31 - so this is actually from react native
158:33 - it's from react name
158:36 - yeah where is react native
158:40 - oh you got it nice
158:45 - so that should
158:51 - oh that looks good as
158:57 - let's go oh
159:00 - man bro i am so excited bro
159:04 - oh and it's responsive
159:09 - man i'm gonna reload on my mobile device
159:13 - so i can get this chart
159:15 - oh bro this is so good
159:19 - dude i can imagine soon we'll be doing
159:21 - like apple watch apps and oh
159:24 - yes yes yes i want to see how much my
159:28 - students
159:28 - made with my i like apple watch
159:33 - yeah like okay today is a good day we
159:37 - made three thousand dollars collectively
159:39 - okay good day let's carry on
159:41 - today we got we only made 500 what the
159:44 -  guys like let's get to work
159:48 - uh wait hold on why isn't it showing on
159:50 - my phone uh because
159:52 - jason francis says look at it on your
159:54 - phone looks even better but
159:56 - it's not compiling on my phone for some
159:57 - reason
159:59 - are you on the lan on your phone just
160:01 - out of curiosity or not
160:03 - uh no i mean i should be on tunnel
160:07 - i'm getting a error that says
160:12 - try restarting metro so is it telling me
160:15 - to restart the
160:17 - expo thing or something
160:21 - uh yeah restart metro is is your bundler
160:24 - so your bundle is working
160:25 - keep that up for a sec let me quickly
160:27 - just grab you hold on let me uh
160:30 - there we go
160:38 - okay so it's building your bundle
160:43 - see yeah okay so while that's loading
160:47 - um so the data points here we would
160:49 - actually go ahead and change to be
160:52 - let's go ahead and would have your
160:54 - labels would be your entry i guess or
160:56 - something like that
160:57 - your people are saying restart expo
161:00 - quit app and restart expo okay
161:04 - so quit out of that
161:07 - who who said that people people are in
161:10 - the in the chat there's
161:11 - like because my mobile app is not
161:13 - showing the thing so they're like quit
161:15 - your mobile app and then yeah
161:18 - so it says unknown requiring unknown
161:21 - module four if you know the module
161:22 - exists that was that was there i was
161:24 - getting requiring yeah unknown module
161:28 - four
161:33 - try restarting yarn
161:41 - yeah it's because of native dependencies
161:43 - okay so
161:44 - in that case you see where we're running
161:46 - the running the bundler
161:48 - so in your where's the terminal i know
161:53 - right here uh oh my thumb was so
161:57 - slow my screen just low
161:58 - so get open the terminal do control c i
162:01 - off and then do
162:03 - npm start again
162:12 - dude i am getting excited bro
162:16 - all right
162:24 - here we go let's tunnel this bad boy
162:32 - scan oh one second
162:41 - did you get it it's downloading it
162:48 - mine's probably gonna take a while
162:54 - because i mean if we probably shouldn't
162:57 - ever continue too far
162:59 - ahead of where it breaks down on our
163:01 - iphone right because if it's not working
163:03 - on our
163:03 - mobile device at any one point that's
163:05 - probably not a good idea to keep going
163:07 - further and further with it
163:10 - yeah so this is where i would say before
163:12 - we go
163:13 - on the next session definitely upgrade
163:16 - or use the imac pro dude or
163:18 - something like that because basically
163:20 - just be on the latest os
163:22 - i see okay yeah because that simulator
163:25 - is actually a really good testing way to
163:27 - do it as in like it will it will do it
163:29 - really quick with fast reloading
163:31 - i see um because it's on your local
163:34 - yeah got it people are actually
163:37 - i wouldn't even you don't even need to
163:39 - be on tunnel tunnels for everyone else
163:42 - um you could just do lan or local
163:45 - and it would be super quick for you okay
163:49 - so so if you change it from tunnel
163:54 - and you change it to uh no just even i
163:56 - mean you could do local
164:02 - or
164:05 - the internet connection appears to be
164:08 - offline
164:12 - interesting uh
164:16 - not working for me for some reason
164:19 - when i do that it says
164:23 - hold on
164:26 - uh it just says could not connect to the
164:28 - server that's all i get bro
164:32 - now so yeah same with me
164:39 -  now the download has to start all
164:40 - over again oh no it's going pretty fast
164:42 - actually
164:44 - oh it just flew past everything oh
164:48 - let's go
164:52 - yeah so you just have to rebundle native
164:53 - dependencies that's it
164:55 - holy that is exciting bro
165:01 - oh i got it too nice
165:05 - damn nice you guys can now get it too
165:09 - i'm pretty sure you guys just have to
165:10 - scan this code
165:11 - just hover your phone over and you
165:13 - should be good to go
165:16 - yeah wow that is looking
165:19 - delicious bro that is looking
165:22 - delicious
165:24 - exactly man i will take this
165:28 - view and i will move this view
165:31 - to the top so
165:35 - i will move it
165:38 - hold on every time you move it
165:42 - moves me stop following sonny
165:49 - all right i'm gonna add it right there
165:51 - and save
165:52 - then look
165:55 - oh that was so much quicker than
165:57 - nothing it did
165:59 - oh and i got rid of the i got rid of the
166:01 - padding as well so it fixed that little
166:02 - bug
166:04 - why can't i uh
166:07 - oh dude as you type in it's
166:09 - refreshing the
166:12 - why is my thing dead though
166:16 - you can't scroll no like it says site
166:19 - refuse to connect or something oh
166:21 - because if you need to run it on the the
166:24 - um this may have changed so you need to
166:27 - open your
166:36 - terminal
166:38 - and that should spin off the server here
166:45 - okay now
166:50 - oh look at that
166:54 - that is clean
167:00 - that is clean bro
167:03 - um okay cool so
167:07 - where is now what i want what i want
167:10 - is a bar graph actually
167:14 - so bar graph or would you want it as
167:16 - every
167:17 - entry is
167:22 - i want a bar graph so that i can see
167:26 - like for the sum daily like i want a bar
167:29 - graph
167:30 - for how much the daily sum is so for
167:32 - example
167:33 - it should look like this if i just go if
167:35 - i make it here
167:37 - so if if you get into dailies then
167:39 - you're gonna have to start tracking the
167:40 - date and then group by date to get your
167:43 - data set
167:44 - yeah i want something like how you do it
167:46 - and then you'd be
167:49 - so it's like oh today 100 bucks
167:52 - this day 300 bucks
167:56 - yeah so that so so what we'll do is
168:00 - to show you like in this sense what
168:01 - would say is like number one let's just
168:03 - assume
168:04 - this was the date right so this would be
168:05 - 26 um
168:07 - 10 20. and then
168:10 - here just get rid of these bar chart
168:13 - there we go
168:14 - okay you can't see my um my code i don't
168:18 - think
168:19 - no i don't think so but i think i found
168:22 - the example of a
168:26 - yes so just just copy that bit of code
168:28 - in and we'll repurpose it
168:31 - and then the data is also needed
168:34 - i'm going to keep it in the same view
168:37 - or right is that okay if i keep it in
168:39 - the same view as the
168:40 - other chart
168:44 - one second i'm just checking i'm just
168:45 - putting out the dots as well
168:50 - why is this complaining
168:58 - don't understand why is that complaining
169:02 - so you want the bar chart okay yeah so
169:05 - where are you looking so you've got the
169:06 - bar chart
169:07 - oh i can't put it maybe there to put it
169:11 - there there we go
169:11 - we can we can chuck it in there yeah so
169:14 - where are you bringing it on top
169:15 - another different uh now i can put
169:19 - it here right boom
169:31 - the error says can't find variable graph
169:35 - style okay can i remove style
169:40 - um yeah for now you can
169:44 - screen with okay
169:48 - i'll remove that too so chart config
170:03 - um okay so it actually needs chart
170:06 - config so
170:11 - we can use this um so go ahead and
170:14 - put that back oh i would appreciate if
170:18 - they just give me
170:19 - a good
170:30 - [Music]
170:36 - [Music]
170:40 - were we looking at we were looking for
170:42 - um chart config
170:51 - there we go i found some kind of chart
170:55 - config i'm just gonna paste
170:58 - that up
171:05 - yes something happened
171:15 - just maybe
171:19 - oh yes bro
171:23 - um man it looked way better before not
171:26 - gonna lie with the orange but that's
171:27 - okay
171:28 - you can always go back to that that's
171:29 - not a it's not too bad
171:32 - um what happened to my bar
171:35 - chart to be honest
171:40 - dude actually you know what i'm actually
171:43 - really liking this
171:44 - bezier line chart
171:49 - yeah as in the i think the line charts
171:52 - nicer dude
171:53 - with that because you would have like
171:55 - you would have an a like a an actual
171:57 - curvature to like what you're doing
172:01 - that's that's um that's true that
172:04 - is actually true okay okay okay okay all
172:07 - right you convinced me bro
172:08 - let's go i'm down let's uh throw
172:11 - this stupid config out bro we
172:15 - and guys if we were going to spend more
172:17 - time on that all you would have to do is
172:18 - would
172:18 - deep dive into their source code and
172:20 - you'd see the
172:22 - like use cases and then repurpose it as
172:24 - we'd need it
172:27 - there we go now this bit
172:30 - so let's assume that the first one was
172:32 - the date right so this is going to be
172:34 - the labels
172:35 - so eventually this would be a map so we
172:38 - would just move through this
172:40 - one thing i want to get rid of is the
172:42 - periods
172:43 - after the 1.6 k and stuff like that
172:45 - actually
172:47 - is that fine 25 like nobody says i made
172:50 - 25.8k
172:52 - you know what i mean 25 like you just
172:53 - said 25k or 26k
172:56 - um hey we can change that yeah
172:59 - yeah let's just um but here
173:03 - one like so imagine you had this and
173:06 - then on the next day you would have
173:08 - 27 so the end goal would be something
173:11 - like this
173:13 - nice so you'd be like you know
173:16 - [Music]
173:17 - suffix is k that's cool decimal places
173:22 - um how about how about one decimal place
173:25 - i think
173:27 - one decimal place would be a lot better
173:31 - that's actually a lot better that's
173:34 - actually really cool
173:35 - bro this makes me want to log in
173:37 - there already
173:40 - yeah so can you imagine like so we're
173:41 - just drafting out hard data right now so
173:43 - we're looking
173:44 - at look at how good look at how good it
173:46 - looks on
173:47 - a mobile device yeah
173:52 - crazy right look at that
173:55 - and guys imagine like if you saw that
173:58 - right like and you saw a curvature to
173:59 - your growth and you'd be like right i'm
174:01 - tracking my stuff
174:02 - and um like everything's coming up about
174:05 - them and then you like go down you'll be
174:07 - like oh like i need to get on my
174:08 -  like you know
174:11 - yeah that's true we've got 3.7 k
174:16 - yeah and then here okay so y-axis suffix
174:22 - see maybe we don't have a suffix but we
174:24 - have
174:27 - what's stroke width i'm sure that's
174:30 - something else
174:31 - that looks clean bro oh
174:39 - defaults to one okay now
174:43 - if you wanted to tally this up and make
174:45 - it dynamic
174:47 - right what we would do is
174:50 - we would have it so that
174:54 - uh okay so let's get rid of this data
174:56 - object we don't need that where are you
174:58 - this one would not following you so
175:02 - okay hold up hold up hold up still not
175:03 - following you now i'm following you
175:08 - yeah so let's imagine now what i'm gonna
175:11 - do is i'm gonna hard code some data in
175:12 - here
175:13 - and then we're just gonna kind of like
175:15 - go through it so
175:17 - okay so i know how you do you do a group
175:19 - you'd have to group
175:20 - by it and you do a time stamp and you
175:22 - you gather all that
175:24 - by the date right so you gather by the
175:26 - day and then you do reduce so imagine
175:28 - like
175:28 - every single one also had time stamp
175:30 - right yeah and then this was a date
175:32 - right so imagine it was like a new day
175:34 - or something like that like
175:36 - um what you would do is this would be
175:38 - your sort of structure for your
175:40 - your objects right yeah every time we
175:43 - push something
175:44 - in this would happen and then what you
175:45 - could do is you could do a user
175:47 - for the data set so you could do set
175:48 - data set and the way it would do
175:50 - is it would just simply pass this and it
175:52 - would basically go ahead and gather
175:54 - everything on the 27th of november
175:56 - of october um
175:59 - gather everything on 28th 28th of
176:01 - october everything on the
176:03 - may 9th of october and so forth right
176:05 - and
176:07 - and then you can just go ahead and
176:10 - um then you would do a reduce on every
176:13 - single one and get the number for it
176:15 - so your end result would just be one day
176:19 - with the amount yep so i'm writing i'm
176:21 - underneath it right now i'm writing like
176:23 - weekdays just for now but we can of
176:25 - course make it whatever we want
176:28 - like uh yeah yeah
176:32 - so in this case your description amount
176:35 - so let's do it so that way okay so when
176:38 - you whenever you push in
176:39 - it's going to say set gigs let's do two
176:41 - time stamp
176:42 - equals new date
176:46 - just for now is there like a blue
176:48 - gradient we can throw on it instead of
176:50 - the orange in the back or like a blue
176:52 - gradient or like a green gradient to
176:55 - represent more like
176:56 - a background gradient all we need to do
176:58 - is just change the um
177:00 - the from two you just need to find the
177:03 - blue
177:04 - i'm just gonna do something dumb and
177:05 - just see how it looks real quick so i'm
177:06 - going to do green
177:08 - to blue
177:16 - green to green oh she looks pretty
177:19 - good
177:20 - actually it doesn't look so bad right
177:24 - it looks pretty good actually
177:28 - that's not bad
177:31 - and then yeah if we can find something
177:33 - else yeah that'd be cool i'm down with
177:35 - that and what's this
177:36 - uh
177:40 - what if the background was white and
177:42 - then the curvature thing was
177:45 - green that's right so
177:48 - [Music]
177:49 - oh that's too good
177:55 - let's make it black and then let's make
177:58 - the
177:59 - curvature is there a way to make the
178:00 - curvature green background color is that
178:02 - what it is
178:07 - um that's there no that's not this color
178:11 - is the same
178:12 - i think that's stroke yeah
178:18 - that's not it that's the that's the
178:20 - color of the dot
178:23 - oh hold on one second
178:30 - guys if you're enjoying it like smash
178:32 - the thumbs up button i thought this has
178:34 - been pretty crazy right now we've had
178:36 - some good retention
178:38 - 300 people are still watching this which
178:40 - is insane
178:41 - um but what we would do now
178:45 - is imagine you have these dates right
178:48 - now
178:49 - what what we'll do is i think as a like
178:51 - a
178:52 - a good sole point as on this it would be
178:55 - let's have it so that
178:56 - each day or added as
179:02 - so we're like just having fun really
179:04 - realistic
179:05 - but you know let's just do it so let's
179:06 - just make it dynamic a bit so this
179:09 - data over here would be
179:12 - oh yeah yeah let's go ahead and
179:17 - spread thanks all right bro i'm back
179:20 - so that thing doesn't turn or were you
179:23 - figuring out how to turn that like
179:25 - gradient
179:25 - green or no no i was just going to get
179:28 - it so i'll point at least like a
179:30 - functional level today we could be like
179:32 - uh it's just like freelance and then it
179:34 - would be amount you made in dollars
179:36 - like four thousand but then when you add
179:38 - gig
179:39 - it dynamically represented the 4000 on
179:42 - the chart
179:43 - as opposed to showing random stuff oh
179:46 - okay okay got it that's what you're
179:48 - working on right now
179:50 - yeah okay that's sick i got you let me
179:53 - let me move the man i'm tired of
179:56 - following you all right
179:57 - unfollow there we go all right
180:00 - now this would be
180:04 - making the decimal zero
180:12 - holy just giving some kind of crazy
180:14 - error
180:19 - hitting no um
180:24 - fail to compile oh is it because you're
180:27 - working on something right now
180:29 - yeah uh can you finish whatever okay
180:33 - yeah go go for it what are you trying to
180:35 - change
180:36 - um i'm trying to not have any decimal
180:39 - places
180:42 - oh you can change that where is the
180:44 - decimal where was it before
180:46 - yeah i mean how i can change it to one
180:49 - but you can't change it to
180:50 - zero it gives you an error you can try
180:53 - it but it's
180:54 - it it like what does it say when you do
180:56 - that something about
180:57 - infinity something something
181:00 - crazy
181:02 - you can try it it just turns everything
181:04 - into a nan
181:06 - so what we can do is we can come we
181:09 - should get command click it now
181:11 - okay
181:13 - [Music]
181:15 - um
181:18 - that's fine that's fine one decimal is
181:20 - okay it's not the end of the world
181:21 - that's okay
181:23 - okay so and then for the gradients in
181:27 - the back
181:29 - let's see
181:46 - oh that looks like garbage
181:58 - all right i think we can you think green
182:00 - is fine
182:02 - i think for now it would be okay yeah
182:05 - all right all right cool cool
182:06 - yeah i'm going crazy over it all right
182:08 - all right let's just keep moving forward
182:10 - so so the next thing you want to work on
182:13 - is what just so when i type it in it
182:15 - like pop it on this chart
182:19 - yeah so we just want to pop it on the
182:20 - chart so at this point
182:22 - we've got this right here so the data
182:25 - comes in two ways right you've got like
182:26 - the
182:28 - and this is the x x-axis and then this
182:30 - would be the y-axis
182:32 - um and the this first data point would
182:36 - be for monday the second data point
182:37 - would be
182:38 - tuesday if the date for today already
182:40 - exists then it should just
182:42 - increment its total value but if it
182:45 - doesn't exist
182:46 - then it should add it as a data point
182:50 - like so what you have because if friday
182:52 - if friday already exists right
182:54 - then it shouldn't add another friday
182:58 - should just like sum it up to maybe the
183:00 - 16 000 or
183:01 - closer to 13 30 000 as we scale it up
183:05 - what what you'd have to do is if this
183:07 - would be like a you you've got
183:09 - this is where data types and all that
183:11 -  comes in so like you'd have to go
183:13 - so let's look at uh go up to the tops
183:15 - line 17
183:17 - now you would have to have something
183:19 - like this where you would have like your
183:20 - data structure would be
183:22 - some like this like you have this
183:25 - and then you would have something like
183:28 - um
183:28 - [Music]
183:30 - looks like you have this and then you
183:33 - would have timestamp
183:36 - right and then like this would be the
183:38 - date right so
183:40 - you know however the ugly time stamps
183:41 - come through so it'll be like
183:43 - but this would be like that unix date
183:45 - whatever right yeah and then what you
183:47 - would have
183:48 - is um you would have to
183:51 - loop over this so let's just try and
183:52 - give it a go right so i'll show you what
183:54 - i mean
183:54 - because what you want is your your data
183:56 - will define this entire chart not not
183:58 - like
183:59 - you don't want custom logic which says
184:01 - like if this is the day
184:03 - true i agree i agree yeah you want it to
184:06 - be like if
184:06 - if just based on the data just draw out
184:08 - whatever you need
184:09 - so timestamp would be um
184:13 - let's just do like new day and the the
184:14 - reason why i'm doing this is because
184:15 - this is going to be like a hardcoded
184:17 - first value
184:18 - so we don't have to keep entering it so
184:21 - imagine this gets defined and then what
184:22 - we'll do is
184:23 - this one would be the first
184:28 - data point that we had so in this case
184:30 - we know it's going to be
184:31 - today's date so we're just going to
184:32 - write new date and then
184:34 - here you would have
184:38 - let's just say i don't know this one
184:39 - could be tomorrow
184:41 - and then scroll this you can use a
184:43 - library to get these
184:44 - today tomorrow yesterday or that um
184:47 - and then here
184:48 - rather than this we would do is tomorrow
184:50 - can be a random number
184:52 - but for today what we'll do is we'll say
184:55 - let's just say it was
184:59 - giggs just as a test
185:03 - we're going to do
185:06 - gigs zero dot
185:10 - amount times hundred
185:13 - oh just to test this out
185:19 - it's working no it's no it's okay so you
185:23 - see now
185:24 - it says so it's got a timestamp
185:27 - and then it thinks we've made 499
185:29 - because we've done times 100 so we don't
185:31 - need to times 100 on the amount because
185:33 - the amount is already correct
185:35 - it's not going to be in k so we don't
185:38 - need the
185:39 - the suffix to be k because it's not
185:41 - going to be 500k
185:44 - you don't actually need that one so we
185:46 - can comment that one out
185:48 - save
185:52 - and now come back so you see five
185:55 - hundred dollars
185:56 - yeah right so now we're at 500 and then
185:59 - imagine we had a second data
186:01 - point and i really hate decimals but
186:03 - yeah yeah sorry sorry keep going
186:06 - what's that hate what was that i was
186:08 - just like the i just really hate the
186:10 - decimals on the graph
186:11 - but that's fine but we
186:13 - [Laughter]
186:21 - just grabbing the mic like oh
186:23 - kill the death
186:29 - 7.99 and then this one would be
186:32 - like you would have here i mean this
186:35 - would all be
186:36 - a very clever thing which is defined in
186:39 - a use effect which gets updated based on
186:41 - blah blah blah xyz
186:43 - but then this one will be this and then
186:45 - here dude this game
186:46 - excited to just like build an internal
186:48 - app for cp as well like where we can see
186:51 - the
186:51 - daily sales like this in a super easy
186:54 - way
186:56 - exactly yeah so
186:59 - check this out so now we've got this
187:01 - right so what i want to do now is like
187:03 - just imagine that
187:04 - this was just like the labels were
187:09 - just you know okay so so we need to kind
187:11 - of have a user effect which which you
187:13 - which
187:13 - turns this information into a data set
187:16 - that's all we need
187:17 - like it just needs to turn into a data
187:18 - set and then kind of have an array
187:21 - and then that array is what we use as
187:22 - our labels and our arrays what we use as
187:25 - our
187:25 - um as our data points here so
187:29 - to keep it super simple we're just going
187:31 - to create two pieces of state one is
187:33 - going to be const
187:34 - labels set labels
187:37 - using and guys this is what tends to
187:38 - happen like you you'd maybe create like
187:41 - a
187:41 - a messy piece of code then you kind of
187:43 - refactor it and it will come super clean
187:45 - like
187:45 - sometimes you don't always get to the
187:46 - ultimate position but then you would
187:48 - refactor afterwards and then it would
187:49 - look like
187:50 - so clean yeah yeah
187:53 - you know and then people will be like
187:54 -  how did you think of that like
187:56 - and it's nice it's called refactoring
187:58 - that you basically just clean up
187:59 - everything and it just looks like you
188:01 - came to the perfect answer straight away
188:03 - um labels and let's just call this data
188:06 - points
188:07 - okay and then here you set
188:11 - data points
188:14 - actually it's just called data yeah okay
188:17 - we're using
188:18 - react native chart kit
188:21 - for the graph
188:25 - yeah junk exactly
188:28 - the just said angular like probably
188:32 - angular
188:34 - [Laughter]
188:47 - like the live title is react
188:51 - native the everything says react we have
188:54 - which
188:55 - literally says react native right here
188:58 - every word that comes about comes out of
189:00 - our mouth is react
189:05 - so what we're going to do is here we're
189:06 - going to say loop over
189:09 - the
189:13 - the appointment
189:17 - this is not a clean way of doing it um
189:19 - [Music]
189:20 - let's have a look
189:21 - [Music]
189:24 - there's a really nice way of doing this
189:26 - um you say seconds
189:31 - [Music]
189:36 - you just this would be objects
189:40 - uh can you walk me through how we would
189:43 - manually
189:44 - add multiple
189:47 - oh okay okay okay okay so what we're
189:50 - trying to do right now sunny
189:51 - is safe if people
189:56 - make submissions for you know the date
189:58 - of 27th or something
190:01 - right like let's say for the 27th of
190:04 - october
190:05 - there were multiple submissions made of
190:08 - 300
190:08 - 300 and 300 right those are three
190:11 - entries
190:13 - we would sum up the 900 and we would put
190:16 - it together with the date
190:18 - 27th yeah exactly right exactly
190:21 - send that information over to our bar
190:24 - graph
190:26 - exactly correct and then we would use
190:30 - use effect to make sure that we're
190:31 - summing it up each time
190:34 - exactly okay that makes a ton of sense
190:38 - so every time the user fires we will go
190:41 - to the bar chart
190:42 - and find the same date and then update
190:45 - the amount next to it so eventually you
190:48 - would have this you would have like
190:50 - you would have date 27 10
190:54 - 20 or something like that and then you
190:56 - would have a mount and this would be
190:57 - accumulated amount whatever it is
190:59 - check this out bro
191:02 - oh gabriel 20 donation and he goes this
191:07 - is some great content everyone i
191:09 - dare someone to match me right now
191:12 - hello sonny from your pwg
191:15 - oh damn dude i thought i recognized the
191:18 - face of course
191:19 - what's up gabriel yeah hey i love seeing
191:22 - people
191:23 - from our course that's awesome man yeah
191:26 - he goes
191:27 - um oh thank you guys these are awesome
191:30 - comments
191:30 - i love the positivity and thank you so
191:32 - much gabriel appreciate that dude
191:34 - oh arnold says i just realized they were
191:38 - scolding me for saying angular
191:41 - you go someone he goes what happened is
191:43 - someone asked me which is as good as
191:45 - react i replied probably angular
191:48 - thank you i know right
191:51 - yeah so now
191:55 - what we're going to do is we've got date
191:57 - amount um
191:58 - yeah so so the end goal would be to be
192:02 - you you'd want it so that you would pass
192:03 - in i mean what we should do is maybe
192:05 - stop faking the deal let's just go ahead
192:07 - and it would be like you would
192:09 - when you add in it would be the date
192:10 - date by default is today
192:13 - and then what we would have is this
192:14 - would no longer be this it would be our
192:16 - actual date
192:18 - so we can start in by saying this would
192:20 - be date new day
192:22 - like that and
192:25 - save and then we can go ahead and say
192:31 - um you would have to do so basically
192:34 - inside of that use effect you would have
192:35 - a group
192:37 - like reduce i've done this before that's
192:40 - that's why i know like
192:42 - you can do it it's just it's like
192:45 - one elegant piece of code that you end
192:47 - up writing and it's always forgetting i
192:49 - reduce group by uh time
192:53 - by
192:59 - it's date date
193:15 - [Music]
193:24 - dude i think with three hours 30 should
193:27 - we
193:28 - wrap this one at
193:31 - the graph point okay and then start with
193:34 - it tomorrow
193:37 - um the next time we go live yeah oh or
193:39 - yeah whenever we go live
193:41 - i mean it's pretty fun would you be down
193:44 - to go tomorrow oh no no you're busy
193:46 - right you have stuff going on
193:48 - reason yeah it might be depending on
193:51 - purely like when my sister's
193:52 - out but um okay cool dude 100
193:56 - likes next time we go live let's just
193:57 - build this like
193:59 - at least just end it with not this
194:00 -  error screen
194:02 - can we just make it go back
194:06 - this error screw we get rid of one thing
194:12 - we'll go back to where we're at so
194:15 - because there is going to be
194:16 - and such and i know i know what we need
194:19 - to write here
194:19 - it's a group func that we need to have a
194:21 - grouping function which is going to
194:22 - group it by
194:24 - the date and then it's going to it's oh
194:26 - i know exactly what we need and it'll
194:27 - look
194:28 - really good once we do that because it
194:30 - will just basically group it and then we
194:32 - compare that
194:33 - with a library like moment.js and you
194:37 - can do something called from now
194:39 - uh it's similar to from now and
194:41 - basically what it would do
194:43 - is it would show the far out date to be
194:47 - um like this would be 27 28 29
194:50 - but then today it would say today yeah
194:53 - tomorrow it would say
194:55 - yesterday was a yesterday perfect yeah
194:58 - yeah yeah
194:59 - it has like really good language
195:03 - yeah you would have a really nice kind
195:04 - of user experience i'm really excited
195:06 - about it dude i want to
195:07 - implement this within cp i know this
195:10 - will be
195:11 - awesome like if we can publish an
195:13 - internal cp app or
195:14 - as a team we can click on it and we can
195:17 - just like
195:17 - look at the income and we can look at
195:20 - because
195:21 - everywhere it's a pain like to be able
195:23 - to look at it from putler it's the worst
195:25 - experience ever
195:27 - it's like normal you're gonna log in
195:30 - every time
195:31 - and being able to log into what's up
195:34 - yeah having some kind of evil dude
195:37 - you're right like even um
195:40 - uh the way we do our automated like
195:42 - texting
195:43 - every day like having an actual
195:46 - dashboard with everything on it
195:49 - like which is interactable you can do
195:51 - things with it you can like kind of
195:52 - check more stuff out
195:54 - like that being sent to you every day
195:56 - that would motivate you more than just a
195:58 - number
195:58 - yes it will motivate you like crazy and
196:01 - i think that that's important so that's
196:03 - why
196:03 - and then we'll get a push notification
196:05 - from the top bro
196:07 - yeah you know what i mean like that
196:09 - would be sick to see a push notification
196:11 - of a student enrolling that would be so
196:13 - awesome
196:15 - yeah yeah and you did you know uh
196:17 - firebase
196:18 - uh is is insanely powerful with like
196:21 - push notifications
196:23 - oh dude let's put it all to use
196:26 - bro let's put it
196:27 - all to use like with this i'm actually
196:30 - super pumped
196:31 - let's do it man that'll be sick yeah
196:34 - this is a good app that we can build
196:35 - with
196:35 - and guys let us know by the way like if
196:37 - you enjoyed this and you want to go
196:38 - ahead and see it
196:40 - um like and you want to see us build
196:42 - this out because we're going to build it
196:44 - out for you guys
196:45 - um and and show you guys how we go for
196:47 - it and i think it's awesome because
196:49 - like dude through this live we showed
196:51 - them how we
196:52 - went from not touching react native in a
196:55 - long time
196:55 - yeah and then you i don't think i don't
196:57 - think you've ever have
196:59 - you ever done rank native before uh no
197:02 - no i haven't yeah so like literally like
197:05 - as in we went from that
197:06 - to the you were coding on this stuff
197:09 - like everyone saw that even when we were
197:10 - the issues we went we done and we used
197:13 - expo
197:14 - we came over a bunch of stuff like you
197:15 - guys went ahead and saw all of that
197:17 - i think that's what they loved seeing
197:19 - you know like the real
197:21 - cider coding dude we were like we were
197:24 - on this page this is how it started
197:28 - it's like yeah ooh learn basics
197:31 - hello world that's where we were from
197:36 - wow literally and then like when we
197:39 - finally see the graph
197:40 - pop up and the reactions all that real
197:42 - stuff like i think that's awesome
197:44 - i'm excited dude okay let's stop it here
197:47 - uh
197:47 - especially at this comment where median
197:49 - goes as an englishman i am impressed
197:51 - with the profanity and swearing going on
197:54 - yeah i love it i love that
197:57 - all right bro this was an amazing this
197:59 - was actually a ton of fun
198:02 - i think let's keep building on this this
198:04 - is a great idea because
198:06 - not only are we excited to do this for
198:08 - the people
198:09 - because it brings them value but we are
198:12 - internally excited because we are
198:14 - working on a project and an
198:15 - app and then we can actually publish
198:18 - this and dude every developer's
198:20 - dream to publish your own app and then
198:22 - imagine just start
198:23 - starting to get like five star rating
198:25 - people starting to use it and leave
198:27 - reviews
198:27 - i mean that would be exciting dude yeah
198:31 - man
198:31 - can you imagine because like imagine
198:32 - everyone watches us build it with us
198:34 - like contributes to it because you guys
198:36 - contributed to it like there's plenty of
198:38 - good suggestions coming up with
198:39 - damn ideas yeah yeah
198:42 - name ideas everything it's not just our
198:44 - build it's like all of us are building
198:46 - this together in some ways it's awesome
198:48 - like
198:48 - and imagine we get that app out there
198:51 - app suggestions app improvements that
198:53 - stuff like we can get the app to
198:55 - imagine guys if we saw the app that
198:58 - we're building right now
198:59 - on the app store like like number one or
199:02 - like number two on productivity or some
199:03 - tracking app
199:04 - it would be insane it would be um
199:08 - yeah that would actually be super sick
199:11 - yeah um
199:14 - yeah amar is like if me too he goes if
199:17 - these guys push this to get there would
199:18 - be like a hundred pull requests
199:20 - because joseph was like i want to
199:22 - actually
199:23 - expand on this uh ammar is like me too
199:27 - you know so everybody's like getting
199:28 - excited about it we'll push it to get at
199:30 - some point
199:31 - not today yeah um
199:34 - yeah not today because the code's quite
199:36 - messy yeah we've left it
199:37 - but yeah well i think cause i think we
199:40 - should have it
199:41 - we're almost at 300 donations you see
199:43 - that we're at 298
199:45 - like 298 oh
199:48 - man hold on i think how much is that
199:51 - like
199:52 - sunny what do you think about uh
199:55 - internal one which has the sales right
199:58 - and then it has like the how youtube is
200:02 - doing
200:03 - or do you think like that would be let's
200:06 - not do that
200:07 - because i think that would actually be
200:08 - pretty i think
200:11 - i think i think pwa with it within
200:14 - any internal tool pwa just purely for
200:16 - iteration
200:18 - because to get a new release out we just
200:20 - deploy and and you can install pwas on
200:22 - your phone like a native app
200:25 - wait how do you do that so
200:29 - how do you install it on your phone i'll
200:30 - show you i'll show you officer they're
200:31 - cool but you know
200:32 - basically we me and kazi developed an
200:35 - internal tool
200:36 - that we use to like to help out with
200:37 - some stuff and
200:39 - the way we sort of handle some internal
200:40 - processes that app causes that we built
200:43 - so
200:44 - a carbon board supposed to castle or i
200:47 - know what it's called
200:48 - yeah yeah yeah so so
200:52 - what we built basically that will
200:55 - like you if you go ahead and click on on
200:57 - ios
200:58 - you can click on the little button at
200:59 - the bottom of the screen when you're on
201:00 - a web browser
201:02 - you know that little hello
201:06 - 300. oh yeah thank you bro
201:10 - that is awesome we're officially 300
201:13 - exactly
201:14 - revenue on the chat thank you guys
201:18 - thank you guys so much press this button
201:21 - so it says add to home screen
201:23 - okay i don't see it one second
201:26 - hold on show it now
201:31 - so go to so you see at the bottom of
201:34 - your
201:34 - like iphone in safari or chrome uh-huh
201:36 - yeah click it
201:38 - and go down to add to home screen
201:41 - so you see it would be there's a button
201:44 - which says add to home screen
201:45 - and when you do that on a pwa you're
201:48 - actually installing
201:49 - the app to your home screen oh
201:52 - [Music]
201:54 - damn bro
201:57 - yeah so you actually install that and
201:59 - the reason why pwa is insane
202:01 - so there are some hiccups to pwa right
202:05 - um pwas don't have push notifications on
202:07 - ios
202:08 - which is a bit of a pain yeah like they
202:10 - do on android but
202:11 - if it's an internal tool we can use
202:14 - twilio for operations
202:15 - that's what i was just gonna say as a
202:16 - text message we can get a notification
202:19 - yeah okay we can do all our text
202:21 - messages through sms
202:23 - yeah that would be really exciting
202:25 - because i think having some kind of
202:27 - internal
202:28 - thing where you can see everything in
202:30 - one place
202:31 - would be phenomenal yeah
202:34 - i agree then it just makes it super easy
202:37 - you see like the business net worth
202:38 - you see the sales you see the youtube
202:42 - stats you see all of that that would be
202:45 - dope
202:47 - yeah and i think even um metrics that we
202:51 - find that that will that could be like
202:53 - you know
202:54 - really like really like because there's
202:57 - some metrics that we've tracked before
202:59 - that we have found actually this isn't a
203:00 - good metric to track it doesn't really
203:02 - show us much
203:03 - and then we've switched to like a
203:04 - different metric like a daily sort of
203:06 - sale and things like that
203:08 - you know keeping track of that and then
203:10 - pushing that to the team
203:11 - every single day and monitoring who's
203:14 - looking at what and stuff like
203:16 - all of that can be done you know and i
203:18 - think that would actually
203:19 - crush that would be huge all right
203:22 - this was awesome should we wrap it up
203:25 - let's do it dude all right guys thank
203:27 - you so much for
203:29 - jumping on we appreciate your beautiful
203:30 - face if you've gotten any value out of
