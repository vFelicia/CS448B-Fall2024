00:00 - guys frankie here from clubber
00:01 - programmer and today i have the honor to
00:03 - sit with my friend
00:05 - what's up aaron here from clever
00:06 - programmer what's up frankie what's up
00:08 - man you guys know aaron from the
00:10 - python tutorials of 2019 we killed it
00:13 - back in the day
00:14 - um and 2020 and 2020 as well don't
00:16 - neglect 2020 also the whole live streams
00:18 - and everything
00:19 - but anyways guys today we're going to
00:20 - hit on the top web development trends of
00:24 - 2021. hell yeah and the upcoming year
00:27 - that's 2018 to an end
00:30 - a lot of people actually released this
00:32 - title right and we wanted to give our
00:34 - own that was back here what's up nas
00:36 - how's it going wanna come say hi
00:38 - and a lot of people gave their two cents
00:39 - on it now it's our turn so we're gonna
00:42 - discuss what's in
00:43 - right now okay so let's get into it guys
00:48 - all right to begin with guys you know
00:51 - pay attention a lot of value is gonna be
00:52 - given
00:53 - throughout this live stream and
00:55 - everything that we say
00:56 - is very practical so actually take it
00:58 - into action
01:00 - turn off your phones exactly exactly so
01:03 - it's
01:03 - time to focus so top
01:07 - trends in web development i actually saw
01:09 - this specific graphic in one of the
01:11 - one article online and i thought it was
01:13 - good how they explained it
01:15 - so i kind of wanted to grab it for
01:16 - myself
01:18 - i'll give correctly the developers look
01:20 - like superheroes
01:21 - yeah jacked him in the world with
01:24 - development traits so you want to
01:27 - explain this aaron
01:28 - yeah so i mean we the way we kind of
01:31 - looked at this was
01:32 - um there are a lot of trends right when
01:35 - it comes to can you hear me
01:36 - it keeps cutting up but there's a lot of
01:38 - trends that you can follow but i mean
01:40 - even those
01:41 - they're just trends but there's a few
01:43 - things that you do not want to forget
01:44 - about when i'm thinking about
01:46 - web apps or i mean program in general
01:48 - but in this case
01:49 - web development is good it's good
01:53 - all right yeah so and pretty much when
01:55 - you're making an app
01:56 - uh this kind of is just like underlying
02:00 - um principles you need to follow like
02:01 - your apps need to be responsive like
02:03 - they need to be fast that's the first
02:04 - thing so
02:05 - um make sure that you always have like
02:07 - fast apps they also be pretty so i mean
02:09 - this
02:10 - makes sense for web development and and
02:12 - mobile development web apps and all that
02:14 - kind of stuff
02:14 - because you want to look pretty because
02:16 - it looks like not then people aren't
02:18 - really going to care
02:19 - last thing is it needs to be intelligent
02:20 - so this is kind of like the trifecta of
02:23 - things you need to keep in mind
02:24 - regardless of the trend like make sure
02:26 - your apps are
02:27 - fast and responsive and they look good
02:30 - using uh different frameworks and that
02:31 - they're intelligent
02:32 - um using some kind of back-end
02:34 - algorithms and stuff and we'll go into
02:35 - these a little bit more
02:36 - as we go into the into the stream but uh
02:38 - just keep these three in mind so
02:40 - responsive pretty and intelligent make
02:42 - sure your apps have all three
02:43 - um as we're going along awesome and
02:46 - exactly guys we're gonna expound on all
02:48 - of these
02:48 - and let's actually keep it moving
02:50 - forward so
02:52 - one of the cool things about this
02:55 - specific you know trend list that we
02:56 - wanted to do
02:58 - is like aaron said you know they're
03:00 - called trends because most of the time
03:01 - you think of trends as things that are
03:03 - passenger or you know come and go but we
03:06 - wanted to base this list
03:08 - off of things that obviously are
03:09 - relevant that are trends but at the same
03:11 - time
03:12 - kind of have a principle right so you
03:14 - know the principles of this type of
03:16 - website you know
03:17 - building or development can actually you
03:20 - know
03:20 - it can actually carry you guys for a few
03:23 - years because
03:24 - we're literally talking about a bunch of
03:25 - principles and one of the biggest
03:27 - principles right now is
03:28 - really mobile first design and you want
03:31 - to explain a little bit about that okay
03:32 - yeah so actually i want to say that
03:34 - out of every trend this is kind of the
03:37 - probably the most important one because
03:39 - it kind of determines everything else
03:40 - everything is under the
03:41 - the umbrella of of this one trend right
03:44 - here so already
03:45 - look at this focus on this it's not even
03:47 - a trend like unique to 2021 um it's just
03:49 - it's
03:50 - upcoming year but each year it's going
03:51 - to be even a bigger bigger trend and
03:52 - that's
03:53 - a mobile first design so i found this
03:56 - again another superhero graphic yep man
03:59 - that's the whole theme of it
04:00 - you know developers are super heroes and
04:02 - no no go back bro
04:03 - okay okay i just wanted to mention this
04:05 - so like yeah it's super important
04:07 - because
04:07 - most users are always using their phone
04:10 - over their desktop so
04:11 - um in order to be able to like create
04:15 - apps that are being used by more people
04:17 - more frequently and more accessible like
04:19 - more convenient for them then
04:20 - mobile is taking over slowly slowly so i
04:22 - mean the first iphone came out what 2007
04:24 - from
04:24 - i mean the first smartphone the iphone
04:26 - in 2007 and since then every single year
04:28 - there's more apps there's more things
04:30 - there's more functionality there's more
04:31 - models there's more companies building
04:32 - smartphones
04:33 - and it's crazy and it's going to keep
04:35 - going up and up so the biggest trend
04:36 - right now is mobile so you want to make
04:38 - sure that your stuff is always
04:39 - mobile friendly and actually prioritize
04:42 - that first
04:42 - because as you can see on the on the
04:44 - display here on the on the slides
04:46 - yep also prioritize it think about it
04:49 - guys like normally if you see a website
04:51 - that doesn't have a mobile friendly
04:53 - design or if it doesn't even have a
04:55 - mobile you know
04:56 - version of that page you kind of like i
05:00 - personally think about them like
05:01 - oh damn like they never got to develop
05:02 - this the company might not be that
05:04 - professional or something like that you
05:05 - know i always feel like there's
05:06 - something missing
05:07 - i mean things like instagram right like
05:08 - instagram was mobile only first and then
05:11 - eventually years later they eventually
05:12 - got the desktop version up and running
05:14 - that's true on the web app and so it's
05:15 - like
05:15 - and i'm glad and how big is instagram
05:17 - but i think there's more instagram using
05:19 - the facebook users right
05:20 - i don't know that's crazy really but i
05:22 - mean at least in the younger generation
05:23 - facebook has been debated by the adults
05:25 - right yeah but by the grand mom is there
05:28 - not trying to catch on and be hit
05:29 - anyways you know mobile development and
05:32 - sorry mobile first design is actually
05:34 - very important and we saw a cool article
05:35 - here from cnbc and they're talking about
05:38 - how nearly three-quarters of the world
05:41 - right now
05:42 - will use just their smartphones to
05:44 - access the internet by 2025. so in
05:47 - five years and 5g is coming to you look
05:49 - look at the ad advertisement there
05:50 - that's crazy
05:52 - yeah yeah because yeah and with 5g
05:54 - coming in mobile stuff is going to be
05:56 - even
05:56 - more like prevalent like it's going to
05:59 - be dominating in the next
06:01 - five 10 years you're really going to
06:02 - make sure that mob your mobile stuff is
06:04 - on point or else you're going to slowly
06:05 - be overshadowed
06:06 - and even from there from like a meta
06:07 - trend level after mobile phones come by
06:10 - like i mean wearable tech is coming
06:11 - right virtual
06:12 - virtual reality augmented reality that's
06:14 - eventually going to take over the
06:15 - smartphones and mobile development in
06:16 - the next 20 30 years when that stuff is
06:18 - like
06:19 - the main drivers when you have your
06:20 - google glasses yeah apple apple's making
06:22 - apple glasses soon it's coming out in
06:24 - the next probably
06:24 - a few years and stuff like that so like
06:26 - once that kicks in then the trends are
06:28 - gonna eventually go over there but for
06:29 - 2021 just focus on mobile smartphone
06:31 - stuff
06:32 - yep so augmented reality is really big
06:34 - actually you know huge companies like
06:35 - ikea are using it right now
06:37 - so you know mobile and all of the
06:39 - technology is moving forward to
06:41 - different directions i mean i'm not sure
06:42 - how it's going to look in five years
06:43 - from now but
06:44 - i mean three quarters is 75 out of
06:46 - everything
06:47 - so another cool point that we really did
06:50 - want to hit
06:50 - is the fact that real-time web
06:52 - applications
06:53 - are super important in these days you
06:56 - can see you know big companies like
06:58 - facebook big companies like
06:59 - instagram you know have very responsive
07:03 - times whenever you are
07:04 - you know browsing their website because
07:07 - people have low attention spans
07:08 - exactly yeah and it's actually one of
07:10 - the biggest drivers of
07:11 - people bouncing from the websites yeah
07:14 - it takes
07:17 - like if it's like a boring 15 seconds
07:19 - you skip that
07:20 - if it's if it's like if it's interesting
07:23 - you'll like watch the first three or
07:24 - four seconds then you'll skip it that's
07:25 - true it's like this we're just the
07:27 - attention span you know it needs to be
07:28 - like fast and responsive where people
07:30 - get upset
07:30 - you know spinning beach balls people go
07:32 - crazy over like milliseconds and stuff
07:34 - so
07:34 - yeah i know one of the tools we actually
07:36 - didn't mention it here but one of the
07:37 - tools that a lot of developers use in
07:39 - big
07:39 - commercial projects is google lighthouse
07:42 - which
07:43 - you know teaches you or shows you how to
07:44 - optimize the websites
07:46 - you know in micro optimizations but you
07:48 - know ultimately it's
07:50 - for that note and one of the things that
07:52 - or companies that actually use
07:54 - this um the real-time web applications
07:57 - is
07:57 - all of these you know so fresh uh fresh
08:00 - books never heard that
08:01 - fresh i mean yeah a lot of these like a
08:02 - lot of the big companies have
08:04 - uh really real-time application and this
08:07 - just goes back to the trifecta i talked
08:08 - about before
08:09 - so your stuff needs to be pretty so i
08:10 - mean for mobile a lot of stuff is pretty
08:12 - but then these real-time things like
08:13 - things need to be responsive where
08:14 - people are just going to not use your
08:16 - app like
08:16 - if an app is slow like usually people
08:19 - just don't use it like if you go to like
08:20 - the app store
08:21 - on your iphone and like oh this is not
08:23 - working it's slow it's laggy it's buggy
08:24 - people just don't use it it has little
08:26 - reviews but like stuff like instagram
08:27 - like
08:28 - and presentation is pretty much
08:29 - everything but the fact is that
08:31 - the prettiness of things comes from the
08:33 - fact of you know if it's
08:35 - too clunky or too you know there's so
08:38 - much going on
08:38 - it's almost not intuitive how to move
08:41 - around the app
08:42 - you know so prettiness comes in handy
08:45 - with actual
08:46 - you know efficiency and results for that
08:47 - app so that's why we wanna you know
08:50 - actually focus on that evernote
08:52 - instagram dropbox uber twitter post
08:54 - mates
08:55 - meetup paypal and salesforce are some of
08:58 - the
08:58 - companies that use that you want to
09:00 - expound on this
09:01 - oh dang yeah yeah so another another
09:03 - trend that's been up and coming
09:05 - uh recently so a little history lesson
09:07 - too
09:08 - so if you guys didn't know um guys also
09:10 - sorry aaron um
09:12 - don't spam the chat because i'm gonna
09:14 - block you you know we're all here to
09:16 - learn
09:16 - and it's it's very annoying when
09:18 - somebody's just you know spamming
09:20 - same comment over and over so you know
09:23 - trying to deliver value here what is
09:24 - ponder let's take it serious
09:26 - let's let's do something that can change
09:27 - our lives guys so come on let's say we
09:28 - were adults here
09:30 - enjoy but what were you saying about it
09:31 - single page yeah so single page website
09:34 - so for you guys
09:34 - who don't know this is another um thing
09:37 - that has been implemented a lot recently
09:38 - it's a big trend over the
09:40 - last few years and going into the future
09:42 - this is going to be catching on more and
09:43 - more
09:44 - and it's another responsive thing so
09:45 - make your websites a lot more responsive
09:48 - so what this is is uh back in the day
09:50 - like when it never first started up
09:52 - right everything was everything's built
09:54 - on html and css i think most people know
09:56 - that if you're watching this video
09:57 - so uh the way it works is you like fetch
09:59 - a page and then you click the link and
10:00 - then it'll go fetch more html from the
10:04 - from the server right over and over
10:06 - again um but that takes a lot of time
10:07 - because it's like a lot of back and
10:08 - forth so there's a thing called single
10:10 - page websites that's been catching on
10:12 - recently and
10:13 - yeah on um websites like facebook google
10:15 - twitter like like the you know like the
10:17 - big mega powerhouse
10:18 - kind of websites and services and uh the
10:21 - idea is instead of like keep
10:22 - like talking to the server okay you guys
10:24 - hear the dog barking in the background i
10:26 - think some dogs
10:27 - it's upstairs and you can hear all the
10:28 - way here these microphones were that
10:30 - good but yeah so single page application
10:34 - websites are also known as spas spas
10:36 - yeah if you've ever heard that acronym
10:38 - before but basically all it is is just
10:39 - saying instead of like keep
10:41 - uh contacting the server over and over
10:42 - again just kind of like load
10:44 - all of it um pretty much at one time
10:47 - into one single mega page and then just
10:49 - kind of like as you click on stuff just
10:51 - kind of like get different segments of
10:52 - that so you really only contact the
10:53 - server like one time
10:55 - and then it makes it so much faster
10:56 - because you're not like back and forth
10:57 - back and forth you just get it all at
10:58 - one time
10:59 - and then you can kind of dynamically
11:00 - load it so uh
11:02 - google uses this i mean you can't really
11:04 - see it like
11:05 - on the surface level but under the hood
11:07 - it's implemented that way and that's how
11:08 - it can be so fast
11:10 - uh things like google facebook like as
11:12 - you click links and stuff like it loads
11:13 - a lot faster because then it doesn't
11:14 - have to like keep accessing
11:16 - the server database exactly so i didn't
11:18 - actually listed it here because i was
11:19 - going to list examples of multi-page
11:21 - applications
11:22 - i actually think i might have skipped it
11:25 - but
11:26 - you know in general multi-page
11:27 - applications are more like
11:29 - e-commerce websites such as amazon ebay
11:32 - all of these that actually have a bunch
11:34 - of
11:34 - sites or websites put together and you
11:36 - go like if you click a button or a link
11:39 - it might take you to
11:40 - an interwebs or a sub website sub domain
11:42 - of that website
11:44 - and here on the on the single page
11:46 - applications everything is handled
11:48 - on the same actual loaded website on
11:51 - your computer like aaron was saying
11:52 - but you know it is part of the
11:55 - development
11:56 - world right now it's kind of what is in
11:58 - i'd say you know
12:00 - get inspiration from the best companies
12:01 - that are out right now so another big
12:03 - point that we wanted to hit as well is
12:06 - chatbots and ai
12:08 - and as you can see here it's funny
12:10 - because like somebody put the
12:12 - adobe illustrator logo here for ai which
12:15 - is
12:15 - maybe they didn't know or something i
12:18 - mean they probably use google search
12:19 - like oh ai and then they found adobe
12:21 - illustrator
12:22 - but i mean it gets the message across
12:23 - yeah so right here they're explaining
12:25 - like uh they're saying when it comes to
12:27 - responses while an interface just
12:28 - presents options within
12:30 - with an ai chatbot you can type in your
12:32 - own answer
12:33 - so the cool thing about this man is like
12:35 - for example if you're having a service
12:36 - website or you know you deliver
12:38 - some kind of product anything like that
12:40 - we use it we use
12:41 - actual you know chat bots in our company
12:44 - you know cleverprogrammer.com if you
12:45 - check it out
12:46 - we got a chatbot there that you know
12:48 - they
12:49 - they serve different you know functions
12:52 - so for example you can collect data from
12:53 - the people that are going into your
12:54 - website
12:55 - i think one of the questions that we had
12:57 - is are you a beginner in programming are
12:59 - you intermediate or advanced you know
13:00 - so it's cool because you can get to know
13:03 - the people that visit your website a
13:04 - little bit more maybe
13:05 - you know make your product more towards
13:08 - them
13:08 - and another way to do it is in it's huge
13:12 - here
13:12 - it's customer support so ai and chat
13:15 - bots are used
13:16 - immensely in customer support you can
13:18 - see it in a bunch of websites
13:19 - so i know a lot of big websites even
13:21 - like youtube i believe
13:22 - doesn't have customer support so it'd be
13:24 - awesome if they can just have like a
13:26 - very intelligent chatbot yeah yeah so
13:29 - again remember the trifecta needs to be
13:30 - pretty
13:31 - responsive needs to be intelligent so um
13:34 - it needs to have all three you want to
13:35 - be like
13:35 - visually appealing to not lose people's
13:38 - patience but also needs to
13:39 - like make freaking sense yeah like get a
13:42 - tangible
13:42 - thing done for the user so things like
13:44 - chatbots and ai and then even things
13:46 - like recommended you know like on
13:47 - netflix and amazon they have recommended
13:49 - items
13:50 - yes so aaron was actually studying ai in
13:52 - georgia tech right
13:53 - yeah i was and then then i stopped
13:56 - to work here yeah so that was this guy
13:59 - deep into that world
14:00 - you know he was mentioning the
14:02 - recommended algorithms on netflix
14:05 - yeah yeah so stuff like this i mean like
14:07 - people probably already know about this
14:08 - i mean like every
14:09 - like software nowadays has an algorithm
14:11 - youtube algorithm you know it feeds you
14:13 - videos you've seen before netflix tells
14:14 - you your recommended shows right
14:16 - instagram shows you oh this these
14:18 - pictures you might like
14:19 - um and uh stuff like even like targeted
14:22 - ads you know like as people are clicking
14:24 - on stuff they start getting targeted by
14:25 - these ads
14:26 - so this is what i mean by intelligent
14:27 - apps you definitely want to have some
14:29 - kind of um algorithmic
14:31 - aspect to your apps to make it like
14:33 - really good yeah it's like i feel a
14:34 - little bit betrayed
14:36 - yeah i feel i feel a little bit betrayed
14:37 - when i don't see like for example if
14:38 - you're using
14:39 - any video website any any website in
14:41 - general and that like you use it a lot
14:44 - and they cannot recommend you know
14:46 - things that you already look for in that
14:47 - website as in like
14:48 - you know like how annoying would youtube
14:50 - be if like you're watching you're
14:51 - watching a bunch of like content that
14:52 - you really like right like
14:54 - uh whatever like let's say i'm watching
14:55 - sewing videos i don't actually watch
14:56 - sewing videos
14:59 - but like let's say i'm super into sewing
15:01 - let's just say
15:02 - i'm super into something yeah and
15:05 - hypothetically speaking hypothetically
15:06 - i'm just
15:07 - hypothetical but um i want to be seeing
15:09 - more sewing videos but if you just
15:10 - kept showing me like car videos or like
15:12 - dog videos over and over just random
15:14 - videos and it never caught on to my
15:15 - trend i'd be like what the heck youtube
15:17 - like okay cool you just told me random
15:18 - stuff
15:19 - show me more sewing show me how to knit
15:21 - show me how to use a sewing machine
15:22 - show me how to uh do hand sewing like
15:25 - and the cool thing about that
15:26 - is for example whatever it's um
15:29 - it's good because it makes you feel like
15:31 - you're one your experience of that
15:33 - website is personalized
15:35 - two it's not only does it
15:38 - like help me as a user the thing is that
15:41 - you as a website
15:42 - developer you know you want people to
15:44 - actually use the websites
15:45 - so you know people are going to lean
15:47 - towards your website if
15:49 - there it has an algorithm that
15:50 - recognizes its searches or
15:52 - things that you know other for example
15:54 - like spotify
15:56 - this is how i get to know a bunch of
15:57 - different new songs you know they
15:59 - recommend me songs that are
16:00 - similar to the songs that i listen to
16:02 - and then my they give me so much value
16:05 - by knowing by getting to know different
16:07 - types of music
16:08 - so not only is it very efficient for
16:10 - users to keep using your website or app
16:13 - but also it's um was it going to say
16:16 - it's it's damn i completely blanked out
16:19 - from my
16:20 - i lost my train of thought something
16:22 - else yeah
16:23 - i mean i was i was just saying how
16:25 - important it is um you know people are
16:26 - going to use it more and
16:28 - and actually it's it's almost this is
16:30 - what i was going to say
16:31 - so people don't like stupid apps it's
16:33 - like smart standard nowadays dude like
16:35 - it's it's now part of everything it
16:36 - should be part of everything pretty much
16:38 - so just moving forward a little bit
16:39 - about you know chat bots here's an
16:41 - example of how it would work
16:42 - as i was mentioning maybe customer
16:43 - support would be a good example of
16:45 - this so examples yeah just like
16:48 - communicating
16:49 - communicating with uh with the user in
16:50 - some intelligent way using a chatbot but
16:52 - then also just being intelligent
16:54 - in in a way like using like algorithms
16:56 - to do recommending stuff like pick up
16:58 - pick up their preferences and stuff like
16:59 - that correct yeah and we were watching a
17:01 - video by
17:02 - demind i believe and like i said you
17:05 - know we were talking about trends but
17:06 - ultimately it is going to be principles
17:09 - and the cool thing about this is that we
17:11 - do want to start out with foundations
17:14 - because man if you're looking for trends
17:16 - all the time
17:17 - and like i said this is based more of
17:19 - principles rather than trends but if
17:21 - you're looking for trends all the time
17:22 - you have to know the foundations for you
17:24 - to exploit those trends
17:25 - and some of the foundations with web
17:27 - development would be
17:29 - oh yeah so like okay really real real
17:31 - quick i see a lot of people in the
17:32 - comments are saying mern and mean
17:34 - um if you guys want those are then yeah
17:36 - these are huge trends as you can see
17:37 - we've been dropping a lot of mern stack
17:39 - stuff
17:39 - um recently and we're going to be
17:41 - continuing to do this into 2020
17:43 - um 2021 and going forward um
17:47 - so mern and mean is just like using
17:48 - react and angular and some other stuff
17:50 - that
17:50 - we'll talk about in a bit but those are
17:52 - like the huge huge trends as well
17:53 - they're gonna tie in but to prelude that
17:55 - uh yeah you didn't you do need to know
17:56 - your basics so
17:57 - anybody who doesn't uh if you're
17:59 - watching this video and you're like oh
18:00 - trends
18:00 - uh it doesn't matter if you know the
18:02 - trends if you don't know the basics so
18:03 - you gotta learn html css and javascript
18:05 - first
18:06 - because that's kind of what everything's
18:07 - built on so we're just mentioning that i
18:08 - mean
18:09 - probably obvious but it's good to just
18:10 - mention i feel your voice going in and
18:13 - out a little bit yeah i don't know
18:14 - what's up with this because when you
18:15 - when you're silent it kind of
18:17 - kills the sound and then when you start
18:19 - start talking it like it it
18:21 - turns out for me but anyways those are
18:23 - the
18:24 - the actual foundations of web
18:25 - development and css to begin with
18:28 - is pretty much it's the pretty part of
18:31 - web development right
18:32 - so you know learn how to use different
18:34 - layouts of websites
18:35 - flexbox it's a great library for css
18:39 - as well as you know css is used a lot
18:41 - now for responsive design
18:43 - and like aaron was saying we're dropping
18:45 - a bunch of value bombs during our you
18:47 - know mern stacks or just you know the
18:49 - what is it the firebase with react you
18:52 - know tutorials and builds that we're
18:53 - dropping as well
18:54 - all of those things you know go deep
18:57 - into css
18:58 - and we use it in very responsive manners
19:01 - so if you guys are enjoying this content
19:02 - and you want to see something a little
19:03 - bit more technical
19:04 - then go into those videos and actually
19:07 - get those builds done and put them on
19:08 - your portfolio
19:09 - yeah pretty much all the apps we're
19:11 - building are trendy apps
19:13 - by definition so i mean we're talking
19:15 - about it here on a high level but if you
19:16 - actually just wanted to see examples and
19:17 - we built all those clones like
19:19 - these things going forward like by
19:20 - definition they're trendy because these
19:22 - websites are trendy
19:23 - yeah so like if you do what they do and
19:24 - you understand what they've built then
19:26 - that's great so yeah mern
19:28 - marin is very big um uh and we use a lot
19:30 - of firebase
19:31 - is firebase isn't part of marine one
19:32 - thing yeah mern is what mongodb
19:34 - express js um reacts and uh node.js
19:38 - and then mean is the anc the same thing
19:41 - but with angular instead of react so
19:42 - those two are
19:43 - are definitely big and keep an eye on
19:46 - those and we'll talk about those in a
19:47 - second
19:47 - beautiful and you know js is a huge part
19:51 - of the basics as well and js normally is
19:53 - the
19:54 - portion of you know the thing that takes
19:56 - action so a video playing
19:58 - so an image popping up anything that
20:01 - requires
20:02 - you know some movement is js
20:05 - everything else like html would be what
20:09 - wait on the website html would be what
20:11 - oh yeah it's just a structure i mean
20:13 - yeah if you guys
20:14 - i think most people know but html just
20:16 - like defines all the different parts of
20:17 - the website and then you have it all
20:18 - there then css makes it all like pretty
20:20 - the way presented and js is just like
20:22 - how do you like interact with the page
20:24 - and a simple way to think about it too
20:25 - is html is more text oriented
20:28 - css is more color oriented and js is
20:31 - more action oriented so
20:34 - these are a bunch of things that you can
20:36 - jump into regarding javascript
20:38 - and so those those would be the basics
20:41 - but you know
20:42 - maybe you're asking what about visual
20:43 - and design stuff you know maybe for
20:46 - all the front end developers out there
20:48 - you know
20:49 - what are the cool things that are
20:50 - trending right now and
20:52 - um a lot of people ask this question
20:54 - what the visual design stuff
20:56 - yeah so i mean what is a framework
20:58 - specifically a framework well yeah i
21:00 - mean
21:00 - we're talking about framers because like
21:02 - for the visual design stuff yeah it's
21:03 - like
21:04 - well frameworks are libraries whatever
21:06 - you want to call it i mean most people
21:07 - understand they get all worked up it's
21:08 - like
21:09 - react is a library not a framework like
21:11 - okay yeah you get the idea oh no it's
21:13 - both
21:14 - whatever you want to call it it's a
21:15 - thing that you can add on on top of
21:16 - javascript and html to
21:18 - um to make cool websites so yeah
21:20 - framework is just like an extension so i
21:22 - mean the
21:23 - main three we're gonna be talking about
21:24 - are react view and angular right yeah so
21:26 - so for example it's like if you're
21:28 - building websites and you're going to
21:29 - want to use
21:30 - you're you're building multiple websites
21:32 - you're going to want to use a slideshow
21:33 - on your website let's just say that
21:35 - instead of coding like instead of coding
21:37 - it from scratch what you want to do is
21:39 - you know people
21:40 - that build websites pretty much have
21:42 - code that they had already used in a
21:44 - specific sense as in like
21:45 - maybe a function or utility like a
21:47 - slideshow like i was mentioning
21:49 - people already build these type of
21:51 - things and those things are a framework
21:52 - so if you're wanting to build a web
21:54 - you know a responsive website there's
21:56 - frameworks for that so
21:58 - if you want to build maybe you know an
22:01 - android app there's frameworks for that
22:02 - and frameworks are pretty much specific
22:04 - code
22:05 - snippets or or actual you know functions
22:07 - that you can use so
22:08 - going deeper into frameworks these are
22:10 - some of the bigger ones right now
22:12 - and web development so angular
22:15 - is huge you know it's one of the biggest
22:17 - ones right now google as you can see
22:19 - google mr google there it was developed
22:21 - by google
22:22 - it has a version one and version two
22:24 - right now well obviously it's a version
22:26 - two
22:26 - and it got a little bit less complicated
22:29 - in version two
22:30 - i don't even i don't want to go so deep
22:32 - into it as we do mention in other videos
22:34 - and you know vue is is a very good one
22:37 - as well
22:38 - all of these are front-end frameworks
22:40 - yeah view is kind of the lagger though
22:41 - right now i
22:41 - feel like angular is is bigger than view
22:44 - it's used by more
22:45 - more people but i mean it's good to know
22:46 - um if you know all three i mean then
22:48 - you're pretty flying hive when it comes
22:49 - to like using frameworks and front-end
22:51 - design and stuff and then
22:52 - these of course and work into like the
22:54 - tech stacks where you're talking about
22:55 - like merge stacks and mean stacks
22:57 - so you're definitely gonna want to know
22:59 - um one two
23:00 - or three of these so view is also very
23:03 - new i think it's the newest one of them
23:04 - all right now and i think vue was made
23:06 - by
23:07 - a google employee if i'm not mistaken i
23:09 - actually don't even know though
23:10 - it's incorrect behind it yeah yeah it's
23:12 - super new yeah
23:13 - but a lot of people are leaning towards
23:15 - it i know it's catching up
23:17 - i know i watched a video by stefan
23:18 - mischook i believe it's
23:21 - yeah his name yeah this guy's cool he's
23:22 - like calm and intense just yeah i love
23:24 - him he has a bunch of experience
23:26 - he was saying that he himself prefers
23:28 - view
23:29 - um but it still needs to catch up so
23:32 - another
23:33 - cool one obviously that you guys know
23:35 - yeah from us a lot of clever programmer
23:37 - and papa react
23:38 - you guys know sunday react sunny what is
23:39 - up sonny how are we doing bro
23:41 - he's he's it's really he's really just
23:42 - zuckerberg you know but he with a with a
23:44 - mask on
23:45 - yeah that's him react yeah so we got a
23:47 - bunch of builds with react if you guys
23:49 - want to check them out on the channel
23:50 - react is huge right now there's a lot of
23:52 - market share for web development in
23:54 - react
23:54 - and huge companies like this kind of
23:56 - king right now angular is pretty good
23:58 - too but i mean react is like really
24:00 - catching on
24:02 - and it's so powerful like we created all
24:03 - the clones with react and firebase like
24:05 - we weren't even using for
24:06 - like a full merm stack or anything it
24:08 - was just pure react and firebase for a
24:09 - lot of it right
24:10 - so fast man yeah and it's just good like
24:12 - you can just
24:13 - kill it like firebase is a big trend too
24:16 - right yeah i mean we're going to talk
24:17 - about that exactly and we'll expand on
24:18 - that a little bit more so we'll react
24:20 - was created by facebook just like
24:22 - angular was created by google
24:24 - and here's an example of the one inside
24:26 - the cute little table or
24:27 - apps that use you know react
24:30 - so so angular.js the guardian which is
24:33 - one of the biggest you know news
24:34 - companies in the world right now
24:35 - uses angularjs upwork one of the biggest
24:38 - freelancing websites in the world
24:40 - paypal obviously you guys know paypal
24:42 - you know it's uh
24:43 - processing payments sony cool i think i
24:47 - believe sony is a chinese web um
24:48 - company japanese it's japanese pretty
24:51 - sure it's japanese whoa
24:53 - yeah yeah oh yeah japanese that's true
24:56 - sorry guys apologize for my ignorance
24:59 - airbnb
25:00 - uses react we built the airbnb clone
25:02 - instagram
25:03 - uses react uber eats oh beautiful i mean
25:06 - yeah like big things use these
25:08 - frameworks i mean like exactly pretty
25:09 - much every website uses javascript
25:11 - nowadays like oh
25:12 - every website like it's crazy it's just
25:14 - like a given at this point but i mean
25:15 - these frameworks
25:16 - like add a layer of um flexibility and
25:19 - uh like
25:21 - like power behind even that more so like
25:23 - these these websites are utilizing these
25:25 - frameworks to like make the websites
25:26 - really really uh responsive and
25:28 - pretty and intelligent yeah and although
25:31 - they are i mean not intelligent you know
25:32 - although they
25:33 - are um what's it called like front end
25:35 - you know framework
25:36 - grammarly uses this in grammarly like i
25:38 - don't see it have so much
25:40 - like ui or anything yeah i mean yeah i
25:42 - guess like view like what is it what is
25:43 - what is ipl dashboard i don't that is
25:45 - i don't know exactly um yeah you guys
25:48 - heard of those but i mean you can kind
25:49 - of see angular reactions that's kind of
25:51 - the bigger
25:51 - yeah oh my god all the express in
25:55 - alibaba right
25:56 - so now yeah let's talk about data
26:00 - oh yeah so going back to like the um
26:03 - response i think it's more like in the
26:04 - responsiveness part right yeah so like
26:06 - yeah they go into data
26:08 - so you want to explain a little bit
26:09 - about this yeah so um
26:11 - if you guys don't know there's something
26:14 - called sql so this is
26:15 - uh it stands for structured query
26:17 - language and all this means is a way to
26:18 - have your data in a database so of
26:21 - course everybody knows like storing data
26:22 - and databases is pretty much required
26:24 - when you are creating apps uh especially
26:26 - web apps because you want to store some
26:28 - kind of data like oh what's in the cart
26:30 - what's the catalog of all the products
26:31 - et cetera yada yada or your whole your
26:33 - social media profile
26:36 - um so there's this thing called sql
26:38 - structured query language which just
26:40 - kind of allows us to structure our data
26:41 - in a database which was kind of which is
26:43 - kind of the traditional way of housing
26:44 - a data in a database which is nice
26:46 - everything's nice and organized
26:48 - um but you're kind of like stuck to a
26:50 - structure
26:51 - and um recently what's been caching a
26:53 - little bit more uh nowadays is something
26:55 - called no sql which kind of just allows
26:56 - you to just dog pile a bunch of data
26:58 - usually in the form of json into um some
27:02 - database without worrying about like all
27:04 - the structures and having everything
27:05 - like
27:06 - oh this this record points to this
27:08 - record that points to this record that
27:09 - points to this record like it gets too
27:11 - complicated versus
27:12 - no sql where you can just be like here's
27:14 - a gigantic thing of json in here you
27:16 - just like
27:16 - dump everything in and then just get
27:18 - kind of like more fluid about it so like
27:20 - i guess you can kind of say sq is like
27:22 - the the structured organized approach
27:24 - and the note sql is just kind of like yo
27:25 - just put everything in here
27:26 - and just get smart about sifting through
27:28 - it quickly yeah it's also high level
27:29 - explanation it's also cool because like
27:31 - sql or sql um is a language pretty much
27:35 - and i guess for no sql databases you
27:37 - don't really need sql you really need to
27:39 - know sql
27:40 - i i bet you use sql to you know query
27:43 - through different searches that you want
27:44 - to do on these non-sql databases
27:46 - but all in all it's not tied up just to
27:48 - sql the sql language
27:52 - so that's an example of nosql yeah oh
27:55 - okay so here's a little graphic what is
27:57 - a nosql database
27:58 - um yeah pretty much so like i already
28:01 - touched on all these in
28:02 - the previous slide just now about nosql
28:04 - databases because you're not limited to
28:06 - like some kind of structured data
28:07 - that you can get faster performance easy
28:09 - replication because you can just kind of
28:10 - just like chunk everything together
28:12 - more bigger data capacity i mean big big
28:14 - data capability because you can just
28:16 - like put a bunch in there scalability uh
28:19 - that high scalability that ties into the
28:20 - big
28:21 - um capability uh and all that it's just
28:24 - it's just easier like we don't have to
28:25 - worry about um
28:27 - like oh having the structured language
28:32 - sounds good yeah okay i don't know if
28:34 - the audio is cutting i know my mic is
28:36 - kind of weird but i feel like they can
28:37 - hear me
28:38 - um yes a lot of people using nosql
28:40 - databases ask if they're
28:41 -  they're actually scalable and you
28:44 - know other
28:45 - and we're about to mention a few of them
28:46 - you know firebase is a very known one
28:48 - i was talking to a developer mongodb
28:50 - yeah which is part of the
28:52 - stack is the leading no sql database so
28:55 - that's one of the big trends that's
28:56 - where i'm mentioning this because going
28:57 - to 2021 like you need to know you're
28:59 - murdering your mean you definitely don't
29:00 - know
29:00 - do we even put that in here i don't
29:01 - think we put it in the slides though i
29:02 - mean just we didn't mention this
29:04 - yeah listen listen to us the mern and
29:05 - the mean which ties into
29:07 - because that allows you to create um uh
29:10 - like
29:10 - just pretty apps that are intelligent
29:12 - and they are responsive and all that
29:13 - using these tech stacks
29:14 - exactly and like i was saying right now
29:16 - i was talking to a developer and he was
29:18 - mentioning to me that sometimes
29:20 - firebase is not you know used by
29:23 - bigger you know tech companies right now
29:25 - just because
29:26 - a lot of companies don't want to be tied
29:27 - up to a google ecosystem of their
29:29 - database
29:30 - and their whole tech firebase is from
29:31 - google right yeah firebase is from
29:33 - google
29:34 - and you know other like bigger scalable
29:37 - projects right now
29:38 - are using sql so sql is very used but
29:41 - you know the whole trend the whole
29:43 - movement is is going
29:45 - yeah it's living out because uh these
29:48 - merge stacks are just so powerful
29:50 - having like cross-platform capability
29:51 - like you can you can actually prioritize
29:53 - the mobile design going forward and then
29:55 - they also have like
29:56 - uh web apps that work on all different
29:57 - screen sizes and stuff um
29:59 - and then like you just have like the
30:00 - powerhouse and the the ease of
30:02 - implementation using the react and
30:04 - angular
30:06 - frameworks slash libraries whatever you
30:07 - want to call it uh
30:09 - and um node.js like you can house all
30:11 - your data on the backend and mongodb
30:13 - like like basically these tech stacks
30:15 - are the trends like the biggest ones
30:16 - that are coming up
30:17 - um but you uh
30:20 - you definitely want to um
30:23 - start transitioning to an oc yeah yeah
30:25 - yeah pretty much i mean
30:27 - just just learn mongodb you just learn
30:28 - learning just learn it check out our
30:30 - yesterday we went live david went live
30:33 - showing
30:34 - i believe was part two of the facebook
30:36 - clone and that uses the mern stack and
30:38 - it's awesome man that it the front end
30:40 - looks amazing
30:41 - so check that out you know this is an
30:43 - example of how it's
30:44 - used i feel like we already talked about
30:46 - this yeah so
30:48 - no sequels used more for gaming social i
30:50 - don't really know what l
30:51 - iot is yeah internet of things oh yeah
30:54 - yeah internet of things web
30:55 - mobile enterprise and it uses a key
30:58 - value store document base and column
31:00 - family store
31:01 - on nosql databases and on sql databases
31:04 - it's more like for web or mobile
31:06 - or big enterprises as i was mentioning
31:08 - and
31:09 - it also uses relational table storage i
31:11 - mean there's some overlap here like web
31:12 - is on both enterprise on both mobiles on
31:14 - both i think what they're trying to say
31:15 - mainly is the bottom
31:19 - there's like relationships between the
31:20 - data everything's like kind of tied
31:21 - together in this way and it can get
31:22 - complicated
31:23 - versus just like um no sql use like
31:26 - chunk at all like like i said like
31:27 - it's a dog pile of data so you can get
31:29 - smart about sifting through and then
31:31 - it's just so much easier like um easier
31:33 - to scale so this is more linear and this
31:35 - is more
31:36 - you know i guess it goes pretty much
31:38 - yeah yeah anything goes
31:40 - and you know just chunk it in as long as
31:41 - it's json just chuck it in bro
31:43 - yeah we'll be fine we'll figure it out
31:45 - so aaron was mentioning this is one of
31:46 - the
31:47 - most famous you know no sequel databases
31:49 - right now yeah mongodb is a big one so
31:51 - that's why
31:51 -  is um the m in mern and mean
31:55 - so for mongodb so definitely learn this
31:58 - going forward in 2021 catch our murder
32:00 - clones that david and sonia have been
32:02 - doing
32:03 - in recent weeks for those and just like
32:05 - brush up on these
32:06 - and guys if you guys are enjoying the
32:07 - content right now we are at 134 likes on
32:10 - this video that is amazing let's try to
32:12 - get to 150 likes
32:14 - let's get it guys thank you thank you
32:15 - guys so much for being here so
32:17 - firebase is another big you know no sql
32:20 - database right now
32:21 - in the industry and yeah you love this
32:23 - this isn't part of murder mean
32:25 - um but we've been using it recently uh
32:27 - first of all because sunny's a badass
32:29 - using react and firebase together so
32:30 - this is kind of like its own little mini
32:31 - tech stack so you should learn merin and
32:33 - mean but also learn firebase because
32:35 - um it's just so powerful like the
32:37 - netflix sloan was powered by it
32:39 - um i don't know what other clones i
32:40 - haven't seen all sony's clones but i
32:41 - know a lot of them pretty much
32:42 - almost all of them are using firebase
32:44 - and it's it's a it's a really really hot
32:46 - trend it just makes it so easy to handle
32:47 - your data in your databases
32:49 - um so in addition to mern and mean
32:50 - definitely learn firebase we should we
32:52 - should uh
32:54 - um i have our own tech stack like r
32:57 - like rf react react firebase
33:00 - oh yeah yeah yeah rf that's cool we're
33:02 - an rf guys for tony
33:03 - the cool thing about the sunny way the
33:05 - cool thing about firebase is that it's
33:07 - very easy to implement i've seen sony
33:08 - implemented i myself don't have much
33:10 - experience with yeah
33:11 - or anything at all yeah but you know i
33:13 - know it's one of the trending nosql
33:14 - databases
33:15 - but i've seen the setup of it and it's
33:17 - so easy it's so user friendly so smooth
33:19 - it's like pretty much plug and play
33:21 - colleen colleen
33:23 - exactly so these are the bigger names
33:25 - and you know there's a little conclusion
33:27 - here for you guys
33:28 - yeah yeah pretty much i just want to
33:29 - recover again so basically the main
33:31 - takeaways are uh
33:32 - yeah definitely learn your mirn your
33:34 - mean and your your firebase along with
33:36 - that
33:36 - um but the idea the biggest trends when
33:39 - it comes to like a high level remember
33:40 - like do mobile first because most people
33:42 - um are on their phones nowadays and
33:45 - that's only going to increase going
33:46 - forward
33:47 - as the i mean there's new smartphones
33:49 - coming out every year you know like
33:50 - apple's releasing their
33:51 - new iphone in what month probably less
33:53 - than a month
33:54 - i think so i mean they always leak i
33:56 - don't know
33:57 - probably something like that but i mean
33:59 - the idea is you know like smartphones
34:00 - ain't going away and then
34:01 - um you know ar and vr is coming later
34:05 - too but just focus on moa for now
34:06 - uh the other important thing is just
34:08 - having it cross platform so this is
34:09 - where
34:10 - um the merin and mean come in come in
34:12 - handy because uh you're able to create
34:14 - um apps that are just like good across
34:17 - every platform so martin is for mongodb
34:20 - right so that
34:20 - allows you to house your data really
34:22 - well um e is the express js
34:24 - which is uh i believe it allows you to
34:26 - house data for the
34:27 - mobile stuff um a lot and then uh
34:30 - reactor angular
34:31 - is for the nice pretty front end and
34:33 - then node.js just allows you to hold
34:35 - your data
34:36 - as well so cross-platform specifically
34:38 - is you can use it
34:39 - in a lot of different mediums yeah i'm
34:41 - just
34:42 - we're just mentioning that because uh
34:44 - you want to make sure that your apps
34:46 - work everywhere
34:47 - or if it works on a different screen
34:48 - sizes cross-platform just means like oh
34:50 - does it work on the web does work on
34:51 - your phone does it work on your is your
34:52 - local app
34:53 - all that stuff uh but just make sure
34:56 - that
34:56 - you are prioritizing mobile first
34:58 - because that's the biggest trend that's
34:59 - happening here
35:00 - and then also make sure it's class
35:02 - platform but using mern and mean
35:03 - uh kind of covers that cross platform
35:05 - for you it's just it makes it nice and
35:07 - easy
35:08 - and then uh again remember the trifecta
35:10 - make sure your apps are responsive make
35:11 - sure they're pretty make sure they're
35:12 - intelligent
35:13 - uh in order to for it to be a good
35:15 - opportunity people aren't going to want
35:16 - to use your like just
35:17 - make sure it has all three exactly
35:19 - exactly so that's a good baseline for
35:21 - you guys to base yourself upon
35:23 - yeah you know responsive pretty
35:24 - intelligent are then using what i mean
35:26 - rpi or rip only love it love it
35:30 - yeah so let me see what you guys are
35:31 - saying on the comments do we see any
35:33 - cool comment
35:34 - um i would some do say i would use
35:37 - laravel php and node
35:39 - so all of those things you know guys you
35:42 - know
35:42 - do implement them right now they are
35:45 - trends like i said based on principles
35:48 - and if you guys see websites that have
35:50 - these points you're gonna see
35:52 - how better it is to use those type of
35:54 - websites for example single page
35:56 - applications or
35:57 - real-time website applications or you
36:00 - know
36:00 - yeah i mean okay so we mentioned the
36:01 - single page applications like when you
36:03 - use like angular and react basically
36:05 - this response of this stuff is built in
36:06 - it's baked in so we mentioned these
36:08 - trends but the best way to actually
36:09 - implement these trends is again just use
36:11 - mern mean
36:12 - and rf the the react fire yeah
36:15 - it'll it'll be responsive by definition
36:18 - um you have all of like the mobile
36:20 - uh functionality and everything you have
36:22 - like the cross platform capability all
36:24 - through those tech stacks that's the
36:25 - point of a tech stack is just being jack
36:27 - like across
36:28 - all these things that matter and um the
36:30 - only thing that we kind of didn't really
36:31 - talk too much about is the intelligent
36:33 - part like
36:33 - actually adding an algorithm stuff
36:34 - you're going to know something you know
36:35 - some python
36:36 - um probably to get to get all that
36:38 - implemented but
36:40 - uh that's also important too but i mean
36:41 - arguably that might be the hardest one
36:45 - yep yep so all right guys that was
36:48 - pretty much the whole list for you guys
36:50 - like i said do implement this if you
36:51 - guys are enjoying this content make sure
36:53 - to smash that like button subscribe to
36:54 - the channel
36:55 - also check out the other builds that
36:56 - aaron was talking about all the mern
36:58 - stack builds that we have been dropping
37:00 - these past weeks and everything
37:01 - even the older well i say older but it's
37:05 - like a month old
37:05 - you know all the apps that we were
37:07 - building as well sunny and qazi were
37:08 - building
37:09 - i think it was facebook you know google
37:11 - freaking instagram
37:13 - tinder all of these huge websites that
37:15 - are trending right now we show you
37:16 - exactly step by step how to build
37:18 - their interfaces and if you guys
37:21 - want to become a javascript developer
37:23 - make sure to hit the link in the
37:25 - description below
37:26 - so you guys can see how we built netflix
37:29 - and
37:29 - we've seen so many students you know
37:31 - build these type of builds
37:32 - put them on the portfolio and actually
37:34 - land jobs
37:36 - so you know if you take it serious if
37:38 - you do just
37:39 - you know want to step a little bit back
37:40 - from the theory and actually get into
37:42 - practice
37:43 - it's a great way to start especially if
37:45 - you want to learn web development
37:49 - yep awesome thank you guys
37:52 - for watching this was frankie this was
37:55 - aaron
37:56 - and um yep just remember uh pretty
38:00 - responsive intelligent our burn and mean
38:04 - in rf that's exactly conclusion just
38:07 - just do that and then watch our watch
38:08 - our clones and
38:09 - you'll be pretty pretty good to go for
38:10 - 2021. take it easy guys thank you much
38:13 - thank you so much for watching this was
38:14 - the top
38:16 - web development trends in 2021
38:20 - yup peace we'll see you in the next
38:22 - video peace guys
38:23 - take it easy
