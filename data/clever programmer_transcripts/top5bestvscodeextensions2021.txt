00:32 - and so that'll be really helpful with
00:34 - that said let's
00:35 - get straight to the value now here are
00:37 - the top five visual studio code
00:39 - extensions that you need to learn
00:41 - number one prettier this is an absolute
00:44 - must when it comes to formatting your
00:46 - code this is the one that you see all
00:48 - the time
00:48 - us using in our coding projects where as
00:51 - soon as we hit command
00:52 - s or control s if you're on windows as
00:54 - soon as we hit save
00:56 - it formats your code it's a must if you
00:58 - code in javascript react.js python or
01:01 - really any other language
01:02 - so when it comes to visual studio code
01:06 - and new coding and you need things
01:07 - formatted
01:08 - prettier is the way to go number two
01:11 - bracket pair colorizer how many times
01:14 - are you coding in javascript or react.js
01:17 - and this happens to me
01:18 - all the time where you can't find the
01:20 - freaking closing
01:22 - parentheses or the closing bracket it's
01:24 - frustrating or
01:25 - you can't find the first opening and you
01:28 - can match them that happens to me all
01:29 - the time especially when i'm coding in
01:31 - javascript
01:32 - because i'm from python so we don't have
01:34 - any parentheses or
01:36 - semicolons or stuff like that so in the
01:37 - javascript world when i'm like always
01:39 - putting a closing paren and then a
01:41 - squiggly and then
01:42 - something else that's when i get messed
01:44 - up i know a lot of people do as well
01:46 - this is a lifesaver for you what bracket
01:48 - pair colorizer will do
01:50 - is it will find the opening one and it
01:53 - will give it its own color
01:54 - so like two pinks will close together
01:58 - two yellows will close together two
02:00 - greens will close together
02:02 - so you always know which one is the
02:03 - start which one is the end
02:05 - so that's what i recommend as the number
02:07 - two bracket pair colorizer
02:09 - number three live share this one is the
02:12 - one you see
02:13 - me and sunny me and nas nas and jesse
02:16 - all of us use when we're building these
02:18 - big coding projects and everybody's like
02:20 - what is the plugin they're using to be
02:22 - able to code together
02:23 - sunny is in uk i'm here so how are we
02:26 - building our projects together
02:28 - with no lag sun even gets access to my
02:30 - local host
02:31 - so how can you give access to your local
02:34 - host
02:35 - to everything all your ports and your
02:37 - terminal
02:38 - we use live share this is one of the
02:42 - best features of visual studio code and
02:43 - honestly
02:44 - this is the clearest reason why
02:47 - everybody should get on visual studio
02:48 - code and actually use it one thing that
02:51 - no other platform has is this
02:53 - live share functionality unless i'm
02:55 - wrong let me know in the comments below
02:56 - maybe i could be wrong but that's
02:58 - the thing that i believe for visual
03:00 - studio code that's the best and so live
03:02 - share is definitely something you want
03:04 - to have and when you're coding with
03:05 - people it lets you code together in real
03:07 - time
03:08 - you can see each other's code you can
03:10 - see who's typing when you can give
03:12 - access to your terminal you can give
03:14 - them read or write access you can give
03:16 - them read or write access to your local
03:18 - host i am a big believer
03:20 - in life sure so that's my choice for
03:22 - number three number four
03:24 - es6 snippets this is useful for
03:27 - you when you're writing a lot of code
03:29 - and you need it to expand
03:31 - automatically and for your code to know
03:33 - what the hell you're actually trying to
03:34 - save
03:35 - especially if you want to turn your code
03:36 - into es6 friendly code
03:39 - so you know those arrow functions things
03:40 - like that that helps you be able to
03:42 - actually expand
03:43 - and use those snippets if you want to
03:45 - improve your code
03:47 - the ease with which you write it and the
03:49 - ability to have
03:50 - nice friendly es6 shortcuts
03:54 - then esx snippets is for you number five
03:57 - debugger for chrome we all are using
04:01 - chrome hopefully we are
04:02 - don't tell me that you're a developer
04:03 - and using safari or anything else
04:06 - if you're using chrome for vs code you
04:08 - need to have this extension because it
04:10 - allows
04:10 - and makes your debugging a lot easier
