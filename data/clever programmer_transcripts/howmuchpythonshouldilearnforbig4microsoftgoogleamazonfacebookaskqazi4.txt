00:00 - - Hey guys, what's up?
00:01 - This is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com
00:04 - and welcome to the Ask Qazi segment.
00:07 - I am going to be answering a question
00:09 - by Kevin the Holy Cow.
00:12 - Kevin asks, "Hey Qazi, I'm a big fan
00:14 - and I had a question I wanted answered.
00:15 - I completed your Learn
Python for Free course
00:17 - and I spent a long time prac--
00:19 - It's a long question.
00:20 - I'm gonna (laughs)
summarize it for you guys.
00:22 - Essentially he's saying hey,
I finished up the free course,
00:25 - I want to learn and take the OOP course,
00:30 - but I was wondering since I want to work
00:32 - at companies like Amazon, Google,
00:34 - Microsoft, and what have you,
00:36 - how much percentage of
Python is the OOP course
00:41 - going to help me with?
00:43 - Let's just right into it.
00:46 - (upbeat techno music)
00:57 - Okay, so here's how I'm
gonna answer this question;
01:00 - it's a weird, it's a little
weird question, Kevin,
01:05 - but I'm not kinda coming at you,
01:07 - I'm just trying to help you
out here and here's why,
01:09 - because it's like asking English
01:11 - how much percentage of English is covered.
01:14 - Percentage of Python covered is not going
01:16 - to land you a job even
like at good companies
01:19 - like Google, Microsoft, the Big Four.
01:22 - I'll also link the awesome talk
01:25 - by this one guy, I forgot his name,
01:28 - but he talks about the Big Four
01:29 - and how you can get into it, and he talks
01:31 - about solving coding challenges,
01:33 - getting really good with
algorithms and stuff like that,
01:36 - but one theme you'll notice
is it doesn't have to do
01:39 - with a programming language
01:42 - and your breadth of percentage
01:43 - how much you've covered in it,
01:45 - it's about what you can do with it.
01:48 - It's about how many projects
have you built with it
01:52 - and how can you help Google, Microsoft,
01:55 - or a local company out using Python.
01:59 - Nobody cares, like
somebody wants to hire you
02:01 - is not gonna be like, Hey,
you know 20% of Python?
02:03 - Okay, let's go.
02:05 - I'm gonna pay you $100,000 a year.
02:07 - No, they don't care about that.
02:08 - They're gonna be like hey, listen.
02:09 - I want to hire you.
02:11 - We have 100 or $300,000 of revenue
02:13 - coming in every year, but
if we use some data analysis
02:16 - on this, I want to understand
my customers' behavior,
02:18 - I want to understand their patterns,
02:20 - I want to reach out to them
02:22 - and automate everything the right way,
02:24 - think Amazon and how they upsell you.
02:27 - You'll click on a certain thing
02:28 - and then they'll bring
up a recommendation,
02:29 - or think Netflix, how you'll watch a movie
02:31 - and it's so intelligent it'll figure out
02:33 - what movies it should recommend to you.
02:35 - Similarly, when somebody's hiring you
02:38 - that's what they're looking for,
02:39 - somebody who can actually do things.
02:41 - And then if you happen to be
able to do it with Python,
02:44 - then that's why they want to hire you.
02:46 - If you were able to do that with Java,
02:48 - they'd want to hire you as well, okay.
02:50 - As long as you can do that thing.
02:53 - So, it's not about the percentage.
02:55 - Now, going back to my course,
02:57 - my course is teaching you ideas.
03:00 - My beginner beginner course, Learn Python,
03:03 - teaches you the basics of the language
03:05 - so you can start to move
around in the language,
03:09 - become a little bit flexible with it,
03:10 - like a ninja almost, but it's
very specific to just coding.
03:14 - But now going to the OOP course,
03:16 - that course is really
about taking the code,
03:20 - turning it into something real,
a graphical user interface.
03:24 - So that course is focusing heavily
03:26 - on teaching you
object-oriented programming,
03:28 - which if you don't know
what it is already,
03:31 - it doesn't matter to
you and you don't care,
03:33 - but the most important things
that you'll learn in it
03:36 - are how to create real-world applications
03:40 - at a pretty simple level,
and we won't be going
03:43 - to the web applications
yet, that's the next course,
03:45 - that's what it's gonna cover,
03:47 - because I don't want you
guys to have the complexity
03:50 - of understanding how networking works
03:52 - while trying to create your apps.
03:55 - Also, you would have to learn JavaScript,
03:57 - HTML, CSS, SQL, learn a Flask Framework.
04:01 - So I don't want to combine
all of that at once.
04:03 - Right now I want to keep Python,
04:06 - have you learn locally,
taking the OOP course
04:09 - so you can build these apps locally,
04:11 - then once we go online,
you won't have to deal
04:14 - with the complexity of Python;
04:15 - you'll understand that part perfectly.
04:17 - All you'll have to worry about
04:19 - is learning the additional things
04:21 - to take your offline app to online.
04:25 - Okay?
(slow deep bass music)
04:26 - Kevin, great question.
04:28 - I hope that this answers
that question for you.
04:31 - Again, if you want to
work at the Big Four,
04:34 - also watch the interview
that I talked about,
04:36 - I'll link it if I can find it.
04:38 - If I can't, would somebody else
please jump in the comments
04:40 - and help 'em out.
04:42 - That's it guys for this video.
04:44 - Thank you guys so much for watching.
04:45 - As always, I love you, and
I'll see you in the next video.
