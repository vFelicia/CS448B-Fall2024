00:00 - hey guys welcome back to the learn
00:02 - object-oriented programming in Python
00:05 - course whoo mouthful so in the last
00:09 - video we talked a little bit about how
00:12 - we had the student thing and then we
00:14 - were able to use the initialization
00:16 - method so we talked about kind of an it
00:18 - method of classes well let's go and talk
00:22 - about the difference between classes
00:25 - versus objects so it's the some of the
00:28 - terminology is important to wrap your
00:29 - mind around even if it's a repetition or
00:32 - even if you've seen it somewhere before
00:33 - it's good to practice and just hear
00:35 - about it again so you can differentiate
00:37 - when you're speaking when you're
00:39 - thinking and more importantly when
00:42 - you're researching online because if
00:44 - you're trying to create a game one of
00:45 - the most common things people will do is
00:48 - you'll go online go on stackoverflow.com
00:50 - or whatever and look something up and if
00:52 - your terminology is not correct you're
00:54 - not going to look it up correctly as
00:56 - well so even though it might be knowing
00:58 - right now focus on learning the
01:00 - terminology so when you see a class
01:02 - constantly in your head set class or
01:04 - tell your friend class or you know say
01:07 - it out loud and same thing with an
01:09 - object do the same thing when you
01:11 - identify it be like oh that's an object
01:13 - from a class so on and so forth now
01:15 - let's go ahead and break down the
01:18 - difference between classes and objects
01:20 - so let's say again we create a class
01:24 - called I don't know
01:27 - fighters okay and in this class we have
01:33 - let's let's do this okay let's let's
01:36 - create that init method that we had
01:38 - earlier and let's go down here and let's
01:43 - just put whatever we don't care for now
01:48 - we will just have a name okay and we
01:51 - will say solve that name is equal to
01:53 - name and we will delete the pass and
01:56 - just like that
01:58 - okay and now I'm going to say Kazi is
02:04 - equal to fighters dot or no let's pass
02:09 - them a name so we'll say Kazi here and
02:11 - i'm going to save it stop giving me that
02:15 - error about spell check now I'm going to
02:19 - run this code in a little bit salsa Kazi
02:21 - name and I'll say print around it and
02:24 - I'm going to run this piece of code so
02:27 - let's run it and you see that it says
02:31 - Causey right over there okay well what
02:34 - just happened so fighters is the class
02:37 - name this name here is an attribute and
02:42 - this initialization thing is a method
02:46 - Kazi is an object I know I said a lot of
02:51 - things it's okay if you don't completely
02:56 - get it
02:56 - object-oriented programming is one of
02:58 - those things that the more you do it the
03:00 - more sense it makes in the store that
03:02 - will kind of flip your brain a little
03:04 - bit but fighters
03:06 - I repeat fighters is the class and cause
03:10 - E is the object created from the class
03:14 - fighters all right another way of saying
03:17 - it is that we just instantiate it an
03:19 - object and that object happens to be
03:22 - Kazi okay and now whatever kind of
03:25 - things we want caused you to do we can
03:27 - do or we can create another object we
03:29 - can call Bob is equal to from the
03:30 - fighters class give them the name Bob or
03:33 - you can give them the name cat it
03:34 - doesn't really matter we can say print
03:36 - Bob's name and again you will see you
03:42 - know you see cat's name at the bottom
03:43 - there so might be a repetition of a
03:47 - little bit of what we did but I wanted
03:49 - to go a little bit more in depth and
03:50 - break this terminology apart and again
03:52 - the more classes you see the more
03:54 - methods you see me create and the more
03:56 - methods and classes you create you will
03:58 - get more comfortable with it therefore
04:00 - you will get a better under
04:01 - standing so I want you to pause this
04:03 - video or after you're done watching this
04:05 - video and before you move on to the next
04:07 - video create your own class kind at the
04:10 - top of your head create your own
04:12 - initialization method can create your
04:14 - own kind of objects and go from there
04:16 - and before I forget here's the code so
04:18 - go to Chrome or Safari whatever you use
04:21 - don't use Safari start using Chrome and
04:24 - go to that link up at the top I'll give
04:30 - you guys that link okay it's very simple
04:31 - github comm slash clever programmer
04:33 - slash clever programmer underscore stuff
04:35 - I'll leave that hopefully in the
04:36 - description below if I remember and I've
04:39 - pushed all of your code up here so
04:41 - whenever we put something just go right
04:43 - there so OOP really stands for
04:45 - object-oriented programming click that
04:48 - and here's where all of your code will
04:50 - be alright so do that and please please
04:55 - which just go and smash that start
04:57 - button okay right there just just smash
04:59 - it okay like that saw that now we're at
05:02 - three but I'm gonna on start it because
05:04 - it's cooler when you guys like it
05:06 - instead of me okay guys I'll see you in
05:09 - the next video
