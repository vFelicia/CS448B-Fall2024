00:00 - - Hey guys, what is up?
00:02 - This is Qazi from CleverProgrammer.com.
00:05 - And today, I would like
to answer the question
00:07 - of what programming language
should I learn first.
00:14 - (static)
00:17 - Now, there are a ton of
programming languages
00:21 - for you to choose from.
00:22 - You have Python, you have C,
00:24 - you have C++, you have SQL,
00:27 - you have C#, you have Java,
00:30 - Swift.
00:31 - And the list goes on forever.
00:35 - However, my point is not to sit here
00:36 - and overwhelm you with the
number of languages that exist,
00:40 - but it's important for you to understand,
00:42 - first of all, why the
languages might exist
00:45 - and, second of all,
00:47 - which language should you
start off with first, right,
00:50 - which is actually the most
important question for you,
00:52 - especially if you're watching this video
00:54 - and you wanna know which language to pick.
00:57 - Okay, so if today a human
being walked up to me
01:01 - who did not know the
concept of language, right?
01:03 - Let's say he walked up to me
01:05 - and he knew no languages whatsoever.
01:08 - What language would I like
to get him started off with?
01:12 - And I'd be like hmm,
definitely not Japanese.
01:17 - Right?
01:17 - That's one language I probably
01:19 - wouldn't want to start him off with,
01:21 - simply because it's a little complicated,
01:25 - a little bit more complicated
than say Spanish or English,
01:29 - which are, you know, on the
language difficulty spectrum,
01:32 - they're on level one.
01:35 - But at the same time,
01:36 - if you think about this human language,
01:38 - like English and Spanish,
01:41 - you can't say that just
because they're simpler
01:44 - doesn't mean that they're very powerful.
01:46 - They're also spoken pretty worldwide
01:48 - and a lot of people understand them.
01:50 - So, even though they're simple,
01:52 - they're still pretty powerful.
01:54 - Now, let's transition that
over to computer programming.
01:59 - What language should I start off with?
02:01 - Well, to answer that question,
02:02 - I would say start off with
the simplest language, right?
02:06 - Definitely do not get started off
02:08 - with a really complicated language
02:10 - because here's the fact, okay.
02:14 - If you do not know the concept
of language at all, right,
02:19 - and I'm not saying you're a baby,
02:20 - where your neuroplasticity is so high
02:22 - that you just pick up anything,
02:24 - let's say you're an adult
02:24 - and you just don't know
the concept of languages.
02:27 - You wanna definitely start
off with the easiest language
02:30 - because once you learn the concept
02:32 - of language as a human being,
02:34 - it's a way to express your emotions
02:36 - and ideas to other people.
02:37 - Once you learn that at its very core,
02:39 - you can transfer over to another language,
02:41 - like say, Japanese,
02:42 - and go how do you say banana in Japanese,
02:44 - how do you say this in Japanese.
02:46 - At least you can look it up.
02:47 - You have the tools to
actually look that up
02:49 - and learn something in
reference to another thing.
02:52 - So, in terms of computer programming,
02:55 - if you know the simplest language,
02:57 - then when you go over to
another complicated language,
02:59 - you can just go,
03:00 - how do I do this thing that I do
03:02 - in this other language that I know
03:04 - in this language that I'm trying to learn.
03:07 - Okay?
03:08 - So, your research process
becomes a lot simpler.
03:10 - And the ideas are all the same, you guys.
03:14 - For example, the emotions
that American people
03:17 - or Italian people or
Spanish people express,
03:20 - people in Japan or China express
the same emotions, right?
03:24 - The tool that they use,
the language syntax,
03:28 - the specificity of each
language might differ,
03:31 - but at its very core,
03:33 - we're still trying to express emotions
03:35 - of sadness, happiness, cherish,
03:39 - hopefulness, whatever, right?
03:42 - Computer programming languages,
03:44 - you are trying to express
ideas to a computer,
03:47 - so it can translate it for you, right?
03:49 - It's a really smart
friend that is right there
03:52 - who's listening to you.
03:53 - You just need to speak to him.
03:55 - Okay, now I wanna talk
about what languages
03:58 - maybe you should not start off with.
04:01 - I would recommend that you not start off
04:02 - with C or C++ or C#,
04:06 - pretty much any of the C languages.
04:10 - And the reason is because their
syntactical difficulty level
04:13 - is much, much higher.
04:16 - So, you have to worry about
each little, tiny detail
04:20 - or what you're saying to a computer
04:22 - will make no sense whatsoever.
04:25 - So, not only are you bogged down
04:27 - by the conceptual difficulty
04:29 - when you're first learning
computer programming,
04:31 - you're also bogged down by
the syntactical difficulty,
04:36 - you know, which is literally
how you're typing something.
04:38 - It needs a curly brace, it needs this,
04:40 - it needs that, embellishments, right?
04:43 - Almost like if you were writing English
04:46 - and you're first learning it,
04:47 - if you don't write comma
or period or something,
04:49 - you're just not get understood
at all by another person.
04:52 - That would be very frustrating to you
04:54 - if English was your first language
04:56 - because you'd be like, this is so...
04:59 - I don't know whether my
problem lies in the fact
05:02 - that I'm speaking my ideas correct,
05:04 - the way I'm expressing it,
05:05 - or am I having some kind
of grammatical error.
05:09 - So, start with something that's...
05:12 - Just focus on the conceptual
stuff first, okay?
05:16 - So, start with something
05:17 - that has a syntactical
difficulty that's lower.
05:21 - Understand the concepts, right?
05:22 - In computer programming,
05:24 - you have a concept of looping over things.
05:26 - So, if it's one task
05:27 - that you want to do over and over again,
05:29 - that's called a loop.
05:31 - Well, if you learn what a
loop is in one language,
05:33 - you can very easily go to another language
05:36 - and apply the same loop.
05:38 - If you learn what a if condition is,
05:39 - if this, then that, right?
05:42 - If Johnny worked over 40 hours,
Johnny gets paid overtime.
05:47 - That idea, if you can learn
to express it in one language,
05:49 - you can very easily express it in another.
05:52 - So, my recommendation to you guys,
05:55 - there are a lot of languages to learn,
05:57 - but my recommendation to you
guys would be to start off
06:00 - with the language Python, okay?
06:03 - And Python, there's a reason
why it's the top growing,
06:07 - one of the top growing
languages in the world.
06:11 - And if you look at most
of the top universities,
06:13 - they're actually making that
the introduction language.
06:16 - And the reason why they're doing that
06:17 - is because of how
elegant and simple it is.
06:21 - Now, don't get its simplicity confused
06:25 - with maybe that it can't do more.
06:28 - Remember, Google, Dropbox, Pinterest,
06:32 - Reddit, Instagram, and I can go on,
06:35 - but those were all built
off of Python, okay?
06:40 - Even BitTorrent.
06:42 - So, all of these things were
actually built off of Python.
06:45 - Youtube was built off of Python.
06:47 - Sergey Brin, I think that's
who actually said it,
06:51 - the person who founded Google pretty much.
06:55 - He said "Python where we
can, C where we must,"
06:59 - which means, we want to use
the C programming language
07:03 - where we have to
07:04 - and Python programming
language where we can.
07:08 - Okay?
07:10 - Now, in terms of the languages
and where they work...
07:13 - So, let's say you learn
the language Python, right,
07:16 - and you start off with that language.
07:17 - Now, you can always branch
out and go to other languages.
07:20 - Once you understand the
conceptual difficulty
07:23 - and the conceptual stuff,
07:25 - you can translate that
over to any other language.
07:28 - Now, Python is a powerful language
07:30 - that allows you to do pretty
much anything that you want.
07:32 - It's also important to understand
some of the differences
07:35 - between why you should
pick another language.
07:37 - Okay, now let's talk
07:38 - about maybe once you're at a
level of certain proficiency
07:42 - and you wanna transition
over to another language,
07:44 - why would you wanna choose
between different languages
07:47 - and work with one rather than the other?
07:49 - In reality, you're working
07:51 - with a lot of languages
at the same time, okay?
07:54 - Now, the reason why you
wanna pick one language
07:57 - and another is because of its benefits.
08:00 - For example,
08:01 - if you wanna do a lot of stuff
related to web development,
08:04 - like front end, where nice graphics show
08:07 - and you click on something and
things respond really fast,
08:11 - that is called JavaScript.
08:13 - That's the beauty and magic of JavaScript,
08:15 - where you click on
things and they drag down
08:16 - and drop down menus and
all this really fancy stuff
08:20 - that you see on the web.
08:22 - That's done by JavaScript.
08:23 - So, for that, you want
to learn JavaScript.
08:26 - Should you start off with JavaScript?
08:28 - Maybe.
08:28 - I would still say you
start off with Python,
08:31 - then transition over to JavaScript.
08:33 - Just to give you an example,
08:34 - I worked on a project
that was 30 hours long.
08:36 - It's called Agile Directions.
08:38 - I might just even link it below,
08:40 - so you guys actually can
click it and check it out.
08:42 - I did not know a single
letter of JavaScript,
08:46 - but since I knew Python so well,
08:48 - I just went on.
08:49 - I would go online and just
look up how to do things
08:51 - that I would do in Python,
08:52 - how to do them in JavaScript,
08:54 - and I was able to bust out
that entire giant project
08:58 - in two days.
09:00 - Okay?
09:01 - So, yeah.
09:03 - Now, web languages, you have JavaScript.
09:06 - For data science and a lot
of data analytical stuff
09:09 - and scientific stuff,
09:10 - and even things like
building responsive websites,
09:13 - Python can help you.
09:15 - Python brings you a
tremendous amount of power
09:17 - and it makes it very easy to
do really complicated things.
09:22 - Why you might wanna learn C or C++
09:25 - may be based on the speed that you need.
09:28 - C is really known for its efficiency.
09:31 - So, you might want to
learn those languages
09:33 - if you're working in, say,
09:37 - you're doing algorithmic trading,
09:39 - where you have to make each
trade within a nanosecond.
09:42 - You're making thousands of
trades in nanoseconds, right?
09:45 - You need something that's
really freaking fast.
09:48 - So, C might actually
be a good idea or C++.
09:53 - Linus Torvalds hates C++.
09:56 - He loves C, so that's why
I keep saying C first.
10:00 - So, that's why.
10:02 - Java, probably one of the same reasons.
10:04 - Video game design, very
popular, powerful language.
10:07 - Android applications,
Java is very powerful.
10:09 - Okay guys, hopefully that
gives you a little bit
10:11 - of an overview about different languages
10:14 - and why you should pick one of them.
10:17 - I would say start off with
a very simple language.
10:20 - Python would be my go-to choice for you.
10:24 - And, other than that, thank
you guys for watching this.
10:26 - I love every single one of you.
10:28 - Do me a favor, subscribe,
10:30 - so you can get more information like this.
10:32 - I have a bunch of other
videos on tutorials
10:34 - that you can watch to start
learning Python today.
10:38 - Take care.
10:39 - I will see you guys in the next video.
