00:00 - does a py can't enter okay
00:05 - I'm gonna do it again do it again okay
00:10 - so you guys get the idea hey guys what's
00:12 - up this is Kazi from clever programmer
00:14 - comm and today we're going to learn how
00:17 - to create a Python texting app using the
00:20 - Twilio api essentially I've broken this
00:32 - down into ten very easy to follow steps
00:37 - and as a matter of fact you don't even
00:39 - need to do the first two which is create
00:41 - a github account or star just at the top
00:44 - right it's so easy to do this you guys
00:47 - that I'm going to walk you through each
00:50 - step okay and you guys are gonna see
00:52 - that within just a few minutes we're
00:54 - gonna have this app pull up and run it
00:56 - so let's get started so I'm gonna just
00:59 - open up a new tab here and go to Twilio
01:03 - comm and let's just walk through and
01:07 - create an account together okay now
01:10 - normally I wouldn't walk you through
01:13 - creating an account but there are
01:15 - certain things that I want you to be
01:18 - aware of as we go along okay so I'm
01:22 - shuffling my name put in some email
01:26 - regular boring stuff here let's take SMS
01:30 - which product you plan to use it for
01:31 - first we're gonna say I don't have a
01:32 - project in mind for the question of what
01:33 - are you building and for language let's
01:35 - say Python has pecans pretty awesome and
01:37 - they are telling us to make sure our
01:39 - password is safe and has an uppercase or
01:40 - whatever cool tories okay we do verify
01:44 - that you're a human being
01:45 - so let's verify that we are gonna be
01:48 - okay and we are in let's click get
01:51 - started here and essentially what we
01:54 - want to do is get through just there get
01:56 - started so you can get your Twilio phone
01:59 - number okay that's one thing we need we
02:01 - need two things basically from Twilio we
02:03 - need the Twilio phone number and we need
02:07 - your like cell phone number or one of
02:10 - the cell phone numbers that you might
02:12 - want to text or bother okay but they
02:14 - have to verify the phone so you can't
02:16 - just do it to a random person you have
02:18 - to make sure that you have that phone
02:19 - available so first of all let's just get
02:22 - started with the Twilio phone number
02:23 - whatever number they gave you just hit
02:25 - choose this number and we're going to
02:27 - accept whatever they give us okay that's
02:30 - our Twilio phone number now we're gonna
02:33 - send a text message to our phone number
02:35 - okay so let's just put whatever the body
02:39 - we want to put let's say hahaha okay and
02:46 - here if you request the code it'll also
02:50 - like show you what code it's using to
02:53 - put in that hahaha so to speak let's
02:57 - just hit make request and it says did
03:00 - you receive the message so I'm gonna go
03:02 - to my phone and let's check if we
03:03 - receive the message and I don't know if
03:06 - you guys can see my phone but it looks
03:08 - like that we did receive the message it
03:10 - says hahaha okay that's pretty cool
03:13 - let's hit yes we received a message now
03:16 - we're going to test out responding to
03:19 - the server and it's going to reply back
03:22 - to us with hello from Twilio as you see
03:24 - right over here okay so I'm going to
03:28 - message them back with something it
03:30 - doesn't really matter what you send them
03:31 - so I said I said why why why TTT very
03:35 - cryptic message very important and they
03:40 - said hello from Twilio as we expected
03:42 - again I don't know if you guys can see
03:43 - this clearly but I'm I hope you can okay
03:47 - so we did receive an SMS message that's
03:49 - great
03:50 - let's hit SMS tutorials and we actually
03:52 - don't need to view this anymore okay
03:55 - cool so
03:56 - now let's get on to the next steps all
04:00 - right so now let's see what our next
04:02 - step is okay so now that we're done
04:06 - creating a Twilio account and getting
04:09 - our phone numbers let's go ahead and
04:11 - verify a phone number so let's go ahead
04:14 - and click this link so I have a verified
04:17 - phone number I don't even need to verify
04:20 - phone number anymore I've already done
04:22 - that
04:22 - and now we can go ahead and get our
04:26 - Twilio credentials okay so if you look
04:30 - at step seven it says hey once you get
04:32 - your credentials and your twil your
04:33 - phone numbers go ahead and put it in
04:35 - credentials that py which is this thing
04:38 - over here so if you were to clone this
04:41 - program if you were to clone all of this
04:45 - in your desktop and open it there then
04:47 - you can just directly get access to that
04:49 - file credentials that py and put it in
04:52 - there but we're going to code this from
04:53 - scratch so let's let's just do that
04:56 - together so I'm gonna go to my desktop
05:00 - and I'm going to create new folder app
05:08 - all right so I'm going to open up my
05:15 - idle and I'm going to code the stuff up
05:19 - right in here so we create a fault we
05:21 - created the folder called Twilio app and
05:23 - I'm gonna essentially throw my code in
05:27 - there once I'm done writing it I'm gonna
05:28 - hit command and so it opens the part
05:30 - where I get to write my script for the
05:33 - script
05:34 - first of all let's save this guy okay
05:37 - and let's call it let's throw it in our
05:41 - desktop let's go to Twilio app and we
05:44 - don't need that folder I'm just going to
05:46 - save it here we're going to call this
05:48 - one credentials dot py and here we're
05:52 - gonna put all our credentials ok so what
05:55 - do our credentials look like well we
05:57 - need a few things we need our account
06:00 - Sid
06:03 - we need our off token we need my cell
06:09 - and we need my Twilio okay and let's
06:17 - just go ahead and get all of those I
06:19 - have this link here for you guys you can
06:22 - go to this link so I'm going to go ahead
06:24 - and get that account SID put it right
06:27 - here I need to get my auth token so I'm
06:33 - gonna go ahead and do that make sure you
06:41 - put it as a string okay so you notice
06:43 - the little quotations that I'm putting
06:45 - there now I need to get my cell number
06:48 - so I also provided link for you guys
06:51 - here in step 6
06:52 - so let's go ahead and get this bad boy
06:56 - right here just like this and I'm going
07:01 - to go and paste it here okay but it
07:05 - can't have the hyphens or anything so I
07:07 - need to remove that make sure to have
07:10 - that plus and that one you you'll need
07:13 - that so basically your whole thing if
07:16 - you have a plot 1 and a plus you need
07:18 - that now let's go to manage numbers and
07:20 - we're going to get our Twilio number
07:23 - from manage numbers okay so let's click
07:25 - here and that should give us the number
07:30 - right here okay
07:34 - okay and I'm going to save it so now our
07:37 - credentials that py are saved and so I
07:41 - just hit command n you can just open a
07:43 - new script however you like and this one
07:45 - is going to be called sin that sin
07:48 - underscore SMS this is going to be the
07:49 - one that's going to allow us to actually
07:51 - send our text so I'm going to save it
07:54 - first first thing you guys will need is
07:56 - to actually install um you need to
08:02 - install Twilio okay so pip install
08:04 - Twilio so just open up your terminal so
08:07 - on your Mac you're gonna say I term or
08:10 - term depends whatever you have so just
08:13 - go ahead and open
08:14 - your terminal on your MacBook and if
08:16 - you're on Windows go and download get
08:20 - bash okay
08:23 - download get bash and once you download
08:31 - this okay this is this link here once
08:34 - you download this you can do the same
08:37 - thing and follow along what I'm gonna do
08:39 - in Mac okay so I'm going to install
08:41 - Twilio the library Twilio okay so back
08:46 - to back to the tutorial let's do pip
08:50 - install Twilio and this should install
08:55 - Twilio for me oh I got permission denied
09:02 - what's going on here I need to maybe
09:06 - which Python okay it's Python 3 right
09:11 - this is definitely Python 3 sudo pip
09:15 - install Twilio so sometimes when you get
09:23 - permission errors when you're trying to
09:24 - use the terminal to install stuff just
09:26 - put sudo in the start and that
09:28 - essentially just says hey I have root
09:30 - access and now I'm want to run this
09:33 - command so yeah don't stop me I'm gonna
09:36 - run this command ok cool so now that we
09:40 - have installed Twilio let's go back to
09:43 - our idle here and we're at the part
09:49 - where we were writing our script for
09:50 - sending this SMS so we're going to say
09:53 - from Twilio dot rest import Twilio rest
09:59 - client and i have my notes here because
10:03 - this is not something in code every day
10:05 - so I don't know this at the top of my
10:08 - head but that's not the interesting
10:11 - so what I'm trying to do now is from
10:16 - this file I'm trying to just pull all my
10:23 - credentials so I created one file which
10:26 - stores my credentials and then I want to
10:29 - retrieve those credentials from in mice
10:32 - and underscore SMS okay that's
10:34 - essentially all I'm doing so account
10:37 - said what other variables do I have auth
10:39 - token my cell my Twilio okay now I'm
10:50 - going to say client is equal to Twilio
10:52 - rest client I'm going to pass in the
11:00 - account set here to the rest client and
11:02 - it also needs the auth token okay now
11:08 - whatever message you want to text your
11:11 - message actually goes here so you can
11:15 - put in whatever you want I'll show you
11:16 - guys some cool text messages that you
11:18 - can do let's we're almost there guys
11:25 - we are pretty much done actually create
11:30 - two goals my cell comma from underscore
11:39 - equal my Twilio okay and then for body
11:44 - we want to say equal to my message so
11:49 - client that message is done so that
11:51 - create is a method that it takes in
11:53 - multiple arguments in this case is
11:55 - taking three arguments to from body okay
11:57 - it probably takes more arguments we
11:59 - don't know but these are the arguments
12:01 - that we passed in it these are keyword
12:03 - arguments and my cell is this variable
12:09 - right here so it puts in your cell phone
12:10 - number from your other file might will
12:13 - yo that's your might will you phone
12:15 - number so that puts that and also
12:17 - retriever from the other file the magic
12:19 - of importing and then my message goes
12:24 - here so whatever your message may be so
12:26 - this is this variable okay now let's try
12:29 - to run the script and see if it sends us
12:31 - a text message like what I would
12:33 - recommend you to do is what I have
12:35 - written here okay this way this is the
12:39 - best way to run your scripts so for
12:43 - example what I want to do is I want to
12:48 - go to my desktop and this is where my
12:54 - file is going to be right
12:56 - so I created a thing and it's called
12:58 - Twilio app so I just go in there and
13:00 - it's called send SMS that py that's the
13:04 - file I want to run okay so I'm gonna say
13:07 - Python send SMS py okay and hopefully
13:12 - this runs and does the trick for me
13:14 - so I think my command just ran and as
13:20 - you can see the last text here it says
13:23 - your message goes here right so that's
13:28 - awesome we just sent our first text so
13:33 - let's let's do something cooler and
13:36 - rather than just make it here I'm I'll
13:40 - send the text again just so you guys can
13:41 - see it and and see it's live so I'm
13:44 - going to hit up here so I can recall the
13:46 - command and I'm going to do Python send
13:47 - so as that py hit enter okay I'm going
13:53 - to do it again do it again okay so you
13:59 - guys get the idea and how my terminal
14:01 - and all that stuff is connected and it's
14:03 - sending the text messages and let's now
14:08 - try to make the text message a little
14:10 - bit more fun and before I get to that
14:12 - just so you guys know you guys can go to
14:14 - this link I'll have it in the
14:16 - description below if you're watching it
14:17 - on my youtube channel and all you'll
14:20 - have to do is create a github account
14:22 - and you can just hit this clone button
14:24 - you get all of this code you don't have
14:26 - to write it yourself and then you can
14:28 - just go and run this command from
14:30 - especially if you're using a Mac and
14:32 - you're good to go if you're using
14:33 - Windows no worries just download git
14:35 - bash and type in the same stuff and you
14:38 - should be good to go make sure that you
14:41 - don't skip this part part 9 which is to
14:44 - install Twilio ok so you can see that
14:48 - the text messages are actually going
14:50 - through now let's try to make them a
14:52 - little bit more fun so I'm going to go
14:53 - to my idle here and let's make our text
14:57 - messages more fun just so just so I can
15:02 - show you guys something let's see so
15:12 - silly person slash n slash and puts a
15:15 - new line so if I had to show you that
15:17 - slash and is is not an actual thing in
15:20 - itself it just puts a new line so here
15:23 - it's the ill say silly person and it'll
15:25 - put this blank line here so /n is used
15:28 - to actually put new lines so what I want
15:31 - to do is I want to use a list
15:33 - comprehension and I want to say a silly
15:38 - person with new line for I in range 10
15:47 - for now and if I show you silly person
15:51 - you can see that it says silly person
15:53 - silly person 10 times
15:55 - that's your Fri and range 10 and it's a
15:58 - list comprehension because it's all in
15:59 - one line and I didn't have to do any
16:01 - other stuff now what I want to do is
16:04 - since I wrote this 10 times
16:05 - I want to concatenate as a string
16:07 - because remember my message does not
16:09 - take it and take in a list this variable
16:12 - here this argument here body expects a
16:16 - string so we need to convert this list
16:18 - into a string so what we can do there is
16:21 - we can actually do this trick and you
16:26 - can see what this just did I said join X
16:29 - so join this entire list here with only
16:34 - empty strings so it creates this one
16:38 - giant string okay what does that look
16:41 - like well if I print this out for you
16:43 - you'll see
16:44 - but it looks like it actually looks like
16:46 - this okay so let's let's do that so I'm
16:52 - going to go here and I'm going to say
16:54 - silly Bob new line I for or sorry for I
17:02 - in range I don't know 100 and let's go
17:07 - like this and then go here and say join
17:13 - okay this should be good I saved it I'm
17:16 - going to go back to my Python and simply
17:21 - run it where was i running it was i
17:24 - running it in my terminal was that
17:26 - running it in my i terminal I don't
17:29 - remember
17:30 - here let's try it here Python sent SMS
17:33 - dumb py let's see if we get this message
17:44 - what I'm not getting it what's going on
17:48 - well I just got it
17:50 - look at that so I don't know if you guys
17:53 - can tell but that's a silly Bob like
17:59 - like a lot of times right it's a silly
18:03 - Bob a lot of times so yeah you can add
18:09 - some more stuff to it like that so
18:11 - hopefully that gives you guys a clearer
18:13 - idea of you know how to create a pretty
18:17 - rudimentary basic Python app using the
18:20 - Twilio api and in this project the
18:23 - things that expect you to learn is like
18:25 - okay how did we use import statements to
18:28 - retrieve data from another file and then
18:32 - use another one right for example we use
18:35 - the import command and send underscore s
18:37 - versus P Y which leveraged data from our
18:41 - credentials that py other things that
18:43 - you have to keep in mind for this is so
18:46 - we learned a little bit about list
18:47 - comprehensions but more importantly one
18:50 - big thing that you guys got introduced
18:52 - to or something called api's which are
18:54 - known as application
18:56 - programming interfaces these are
18:58 - tremendously powerful and essentially
19:01 - they can give you unlimited power
19:03 - without you having to do anything this
19:05 - is you leveraging somebody else's
19:08 - application or an app because remember
19:11 - we didn't write this texting app we
19:13 - leveraged Twilio API to do it for us
19:16 - Julia knows what to do with the texting
19:19 - and then we just get to leverage it I
19:20 - have a few apps that I created which
19:22 - leverage the search engine and Google
19:24 - Maps because I use a Google Maps API and
19:27 - integrated it into my own website so it
19:31 - feels like I did it but really I just
19:33 - leverage the API of Google Maps there
19:36 - are tons of other api's like that like
19:38 - Yelp API you can pull local restaurants
19:41 - and see what their ratings is and what
19:45 - restaurant is hot and popping up and you
19:47 - can actually integrate that data into
19:49 - your own personalized app or even a
19:52 - mobile app using the Yelp API so api's
19:56 - are actually tremendously powerful and
19:57 - this was just a little hint of that I
20:00 - really hope you guys didn't run into any
20:02 - problems and instructions were clear if
20:04 - there were not please comment below and
20:07 - I will personally help you out and we
20:09 - will get your app up and running because
20:11 - I really would love it if you guys were
20:14 - able to send this you know text to
20:16 - yourself or to anybody you know maybe
20:19 - your spouse or your friend you know just
20:22 - to have a little bit of fun now do
20:24 - remember that with a free Twilio account
20:26 - you only can text verifying numbers
20:28 - which means you can't just text anybody
20:31 - that you want so if you pay then you
20:35 - will be allowed to actually text whoever
20:37 - you want it's not much I think it's one
20:40 - dollar a month but I could be wrong
20:42 - that's what I what I saw other than that
20:47 - that's what this is about I think what
20:51 - I'm working on now is creating a chess
20:53 - app so I might actually have a project
20:56 - for you guys on that and we might
20:59 - actually build it from creating the
21:01 - chess engine so the logic in the user
21:03 - interface
21:04 - then though chess multiplayer app so
21:08 - that's something actually I'm currently
21:10 - writing and once it's done I'll probably
21:13 - have it presented to you guys anyways
21:15 - guys I love you so much
21:17 - please like the video if you liked it
21:20 - and subscribe to the channel and I'll
21:23 - see you on the other side okay take care
21:25 - bye
