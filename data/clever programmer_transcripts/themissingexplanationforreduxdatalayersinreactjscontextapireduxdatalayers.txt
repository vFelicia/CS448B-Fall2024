00:02 - i just want to like visualize what we're
00:04 - doing here so guys we're
00:05 - the data layer that sunny is talking
00:07 - about we've explained it in
00:10 - a few uh other of our videos so we're
00:12 - not going to go too much into detail of
00:14 - it but
00:15 - i kind of just want to touch base on it
00:16 - a little bit
00:18 - but in this data layer we're going to
00:20 - have the user
00:22 - and we want to be able to access this
00:23 - user from anywhere
00:26 - in our app so for example whether we
00:28 - have our app you know here
00:32 - um and then this connects to like our
00:34 - different components that we have in our
00:35 - app
00:36 - so like what would be one of our
00:37 - components like chat
00:39 - yep so chat uh what other components do
00:43 - we have like header
00:44 - sidebar header yeah okay so i'm just
00:47 - gonna draw them in like kind of random
00:49 - areas okay so i'm just gonna draw
00:51 - uh we have like other components like
00:54 - sidebar and we also have
00:58 - other component like header
01:01 - and what we want to be able to do you
01:03 - guys is
01:05 - instead of doing something called prop
01:07 - drilling which is a problem like
01:09 - to access user you know we'll have to
01:11 - like go inside of app
01:12 - and then chat and then this and then
01:14 - access user like that
01:16 - instead of that we want to have a data
01:17 - layer on the on you know just imagine
01:19 - like one bucket
01:21 - and then we can access the user from
01:23 - anywhere within the app so if we want to
01:25 - use them
01:25 - within our component of chat we can just
01:28 - directly use it
01:29 - if we want to access it in sidebar we
01:31 - can directly use it instead of like
01:34 - if app knows about user then the way we
01:37 - access users to
01:38 - like drill down every single level so
01:41 - that's what we're doing
01:42 - right now with all the technology when
01:44 - we talk about redux
01:46 - or when we talk about context apis
01:50 - what we're really talking about is this
01:52 - main concept called data
01:54 - layer this thing right here and it's
01:56 - just this bucket that we keep on the
01:57 - side that we can instantly access that's
01:59 - it
01:59 - okay it has all these complex terms like
02:02 - redux and state managers and this and
02:04 - that and the other freaking thing
02:06 - but in its simplest form is i want to be
02:09 - able to use this
02:10 - as fast as possible that's it
02:13 - and have direct access to it anywhere
02:15 - i'm at
02:16 - exactly i think that was such a clean
02:19 - breakdown guys and i
02:20 - really really think if that if that
02:22 - helped you out guys all with us
02:24 - smash the thumbs up button yeah do that
02:26 - [Laughter]
02:30 - that was actually really clean now you
02:32 - because that's quite a people get very
02:33 - scared by that sort of explanation guys
02:35 - but it's all that sort of
02:36 - the idea of the react context api and
02:39 - like you saw it's actually a very simple
02:40 - concept
02:41 - it's just a case of once you implement
02:43 - it once and practice with it
02:45 - it will make sense and you get to use it
02:46 - okay so
02:48 - nice so with that said let's jump in so
02:51 - we've got to basically set
02:52 - so what cause he showed
