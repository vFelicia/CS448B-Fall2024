00:00 - hey guys what's up this is Kazi from
00:02 - clever programmer comm we've got a
00:06 - pretty fancy new setup hopefully you
00:08 - guys love it let us know in the comments
00:11 - below what do you guys think but in this
00:13 - video we're going to be talking about am
00:16 - I too old to start coding or to start
00:20 - computer programming this is one thing
00:22 - that always excites me because people
00:24 - are always trying to find all kinds of
00:26 - excuses to not do it so in this video
00:30 - we're going to tackle this question so
00:32 - without any further ado let's jump right
00:34 - into it
00:36 - [Music]
00:45 - [Applause]
00:47 - so this question comes up a lot hey kasi
00:51 - am I too old to start computer
00:53 - programming now this is a question I've
00:54 - answered in many different videos but
01:00 - I'm going to answer it here as well
01:02 - along with some other common you know
01:06 - things that people have which is am I
01:08 - you know smart enough to actually code
01:11 - or do I need to do I know enough math to
01:14 - become a computer programmer so first
01:17 - let's just start off with you know am I
01:20 - too old to start computer programming
01:22 - and you know the answer there is unless
01:26 - you're physically incapable of actually
01:28 - coding I don't think you're too old to
01:31 - actually start coding you know even even
01:34 - if you're 60 years old or seven years
01:36 - old
01:36 - the beauty about this skill is you can
01:39 - learn it and you don't need to
01:41 - physically exert yourself right it's
01:43 - actually just understanding memory
01:45 - intelligence things of that nature and
01:47 - as you get older you actually become
01:50 - smarter right believe it or not and a
01:53 - lot of the times your memory actually
01:55 - becomes stronger that's why you'll see a
01:57 - lot of old people have like thousand
01:59 - different stories that they remember and
02:01 - then they can tell you word for word
02:03 - whereas I always have trouble
02:06 - remembering stories so I'm younger and
02:10 - my brain actually you know from the
02:13 - psychology perspective hasn't even fully
02:15 - developed till I'm 25 years old
02:19 - so if you're older you're actually at an
02:21 - advantage the only disadvantage you have
02:23 - is time because you know if you're if
02:26 - you're 60 years old or 50 years old and
02:29 - you're you're maybe like hey can I
02:32 - actually switch to computer programming
02:34 - and then start making enough money and
02:36 - actually start getting promoted at my
02:39 - job where I'm actually able to have a
02:42 - significant career you don't want to
02:45 - just be in that weird zone where you're
02:47 - not getting any promotions and you're
02:48 - just mediocre there or maybe you don't
02:51 - even get a job so let me talk you
02:54 - through that one now what happens
02:57 - when you become a computer programmer or
02:59 - you started learning this skill it
03:02 - doesn't take that long if you can invest
03:05 - a certain amount of time every single
03:07 - day which you can you know easily open
03:09 - up you can find that time I go deeper
03:12 - into that in how long should you code
03:14 - every day and order the best coding
03:15 - resources it's a video I recently made
03:17 - and in that one I really tell you how
03:19 - you can find time but in this video let
03:21 - me just tell you in a simple way
03:22 - after you're done sleeping and after
03:24 - you're done going to work and after
03:26 - you're done you know spending time with
03:28 - your kids and your wife or your husband
03:31 - whatever you always have a few hours
03:33 - left that you can choose to invest in to
03:35 - Netflix or maybe you just want to like
03:38 - relax and hang out or you can invest
03:40 - that time actually into coding and you
03:42 - can turn it into something that you do
03:44 - fun and it's like a ritual so as long as
03:47 - you can actually practice this it
03:49 - shouldn't take you that long to actually
03:51 - start you know to get a job and this
03:54 - shouldn't even take you a year it should
03:56 - take you less and you can actually get a
03:58 - significant paying job you know average
04:01 - developer salary is over 70 or 80
04:04 - thousand dollars a year depending on
04:06 - where you're at in Chicago people who
04:09 - are doing Python are making over $90,000
04:12 - a year on average regardless of their
04:14 - age here I have a comment I don't know
04:17 - how old Katherine is but it's a really
04:20 - awesome comment by Katherine brown in my
04:23 - recent video and she said and this is
04:25 - actually surprising to me because I
04:27 - didn't know I had this audience watching
04:28 - my videos and she says I'm a mom of
04:33 - three and a devoted housewife I'm just
04:36 - starting but I've been putting in five
04:39 - hours a day while my kids are at school
04:41 - and while my husband works I have
04:45 - enjoyed your enthusiasm while doing your
04:48 - Python course and really think you're
04:50 - doing a great job explaining things in a
04:52 - way I can understand thank you so first
04:55 - of all mom thank you so much Katherine I
04:58 - did not know that somebody you know a
05:01 - mom would be watching my materialists
05:03 - like so crazy all over the place and I
05:06 - felt like most people especially when
05:09 - her older
05:11 - and a really mature would probably just
05:12 - like losing me like who's this crazy kid
05:14 - why is he so excited about coding all
05:16 - the damn time
05:16 - so thanks actually for watching it and
05:20 - also for letting me know that you're
05:21 - there because I didn't think that this
05:24 - is this was another type of audience
05:26 - that I had watching the videos but more
05:29 - importantly the takeaway for you guys
05:31 - here is I don't know how old she is
05:33 - right but one thing that I can't tell is
05:35 - how smart she's being in terms of like
05:38 - finding time I mean she has three kids
05:40 - right and his a housewife and always
05:43 - working on that I know my mom is like
05:46 - that and she has like no time available
05:48 - in the day ever since I was growing up
05:50 - with my mom like she was always busy
05:53 - just like taking care of us kids and she
05:55 - never had time but Katherine managed to
05:57 - find time right when her husband goes to
05:59 - work and when the kids are maybe
06:03 - somewhere else
06:04 - she's investing five hours a day now
06:06 - that's a crazy amount of time that's
06:08 - awesome if you can do that you know I
06:11 - was investing 17 hours a day but again
06:13 - when I was starting out I didn't have
06:15 - you know kids to take care of and I
06:17 - didn't have insane amount of commitments
06:19 - so it was a little bit easier for me
06:21 - that's why I invested so much time but
06:23 - you know you can take a lesson from her
06:25 - that you can also figure out how you can
06:28 - invest this time right and if you're
06:30 - smart about it
06:31 - trust me there is time there you just
06:34 - need to dig it out and be smart about it
06:36 - these little 30-minute rampages a
06:38 - Facebook newsfeed that you'll go to
06:40 - write or Instagram newsfeed they start
06:44 - adding up throughout the day and here's
06:47 - one weird thing that happens with them
06:48 - when you go for five to ten minutes just
06:51 - like look at your notifications on your
06:53 - phone it's not just that it takes up
06:55 - exactly five or ten minutes of your time
06:57 - what it also does is that when you're
06:59 - driving and you're walking around or
07:01 - you're doing whatever your brain is
07:03 - actually filled with the newsfeed so
07:07 - instead of thinking about maybe coming
07:08 - up with some brilliant ideas or letting
07:10 - your brain just like come up with
07:12 - creative unique ideas your brain is
07:14 - thinking about you know Shaniqua is
07:16 - latest post that got 20 likes and she
07:19 - was having a fight or some kind of crazy
07:21 - drama going on right so it's nothing
07:23 - productive happening in your brain
07:24 - is thinking for hours about something
07:27 - that's not productive and something
07:29 - that's just like holding you back so
07:31 - even though you're spending five minutes
07:33 - it's affecting hours worth of your
07:35 - thinking every day now let's replace
07:37 - that and let's say you have a simple app
07:39 - on your phone like solo learn which is a
07:41 - really great app for people who are
07:44 - trying to pick up coding or Python or
07:46 - whatever and let's say instead of you
07:49 - know spending five minutes on Facebook
07:50 - you go five minutes and just play with
07:53 - that app and try out a new cool coding
07:55 - thing well guess what happens now when
07:58 - you're walking around and you're driving
07:59 - you're thinking about Oh conditional
08:02 - statements or if-then statements or you
08:05 - know how do I do this cool thing that I
08:07 - just learned now you're thinking about
08:08 - programming so even when you're driving
08:10 - around or whatever that time is actually
08:13 - being invested into coding and you're
08:15 - developing an interest for it so that
08:18 - allows you to actually get into this
08:19 - field a lot quicker especially if you're
08:21 - older this is how you can hack your way
08:24 - to get more time some other things I
08:27 - like to do to just you know get
08:29 - interested into this field
08:31 - well if I'm driving I'll be listening to
08:34 - a podcast that has to do with computer
08:36 - programming or I'll have a book on
08:38 - audible that has to do with computer
08:40 - programming so replacing your music with
08:43 - something related to this can also help
08:45 - you achieve and learn all this a lot
08:48 - faster so again there's no such thing as
08:51 - am I too old if you're literally
08:53 - physically incapable um then yes you
08:57 - then it's not the right fit for you
09:00 - right and I'm talking about like maybe
09:01 - your hands just literally don't work but
09:04 - if you're in a situation where you can
09:08 - actually understand what's going on and
09:11 - you know even if you're 60 or 70 years
09:12 - old you can pick this up and you can
09:15 - actually become a freelancer on websites
09:17 - like upwork or oDesk or you can choose
09:20 - to go the traditional route and try to
09:22 - find you know full-time work some other
09:25 - things that come up or am I not smart
09:27 - enough to do coding and this is
09:29 - something I've already mentioned but
09:31 - again I am NOT the smartest person you
09:34 - know I myself got her at Lee's low score
09:37 - even on a seat
09:38 - which is standardized test in high
09:40 - school but I am here now
09:43 - and I am doing computer programming and
09:45 - I constantly get new job offers I
09:47 - constantly am getting new clients I'm
09:50 - constantly getting new people that I
09:52 - coach in computer programming so you
09:55 - know and and it didn't take me long to
09:57 - pick up computer programming I was
09:59 - getting paid within three months of
10:02 - picking it up let me repeat that I was
10:04 - getting paid within three months of
10:07 - picking up computer programming I didn't
10:09 - have a I didn't have a full time job but
10:11 - I did find clients who I was coaching
10:14 - and they paid to learn from me so that's
10:17 - something that you can do as well right
10:19 - you can find people who you can coach
10:22 - that way you're solidifying your
10:24 - understanding and secondly you're also
10:27 - obviously getting paid so now you have
10:30 - to do less work at your current job and
10:33 - that can also give you more time because
10:35 - now if you start getting paid with
10:37 - coding all of a sudden you have more
10:38 - time because you can reduce the amount
10:40 - of hours you're putting in to your
10:41 - current job increase the amount of hours
10:43 - you're putting into programming and
10:45 - getting paid from programming so that's
10:47 - another hack for finding more time
10:49 - programming is something that you can
10:51 - pick up very quickly you can pick up a
10:53 - job in it very quickly but it's not easy
10:56 - so you do have to invest that time in
10:58 - okay so the video I will recommend to
11:00 - you to watch after this is how long
11:02 - should you code every day and what are
11:05 - the best resources for you to practice
11:07 - so go ahead watch that video and that's
11:10 - it for me hopefully you enjoyed it
11:12 - hopefully you'll love this new setup
11:14 - comment below and as always I love your
11:17 - faces off and I'll see you in the next
11:20 - video
11:22 - [Music]
