10:50 - that's essentially africa man
10:54 - all right it's tough but i think it's
10:56 - possible for all of us okay
10:58 - so for me how i started my journey right
11:01 - i
11:01 - am i came from pakistan i came here
11:04 - not knowing a single letter of english i
11:06 - came at the age of nine
11:08 - so i had to learn english which was a
11:10 - really hard part and i
11:12 - was in second grade in pakistan once i
11:14 - got here
11:15 - it took me a few years and i was that
11:17 - weird kid that went to high school and i
11:19 - literally went from second grade
11:21 - straight to high school because in
11:22 - between i went to this religious school
11:24 - and in that religious school it would be
11:26 - about 15 hours a day
11:28 - and they would just like beat the [ __ ]
11:30 - out of you for kind of like
11:31 - no reason i mean i didn't do my homework
11:33 - but still like
11:34 - they would actually beat you up pretty
11:36 - bad and so
11:38 - going from that to a high school was
11:40 - really weird i was that kid i didn't
11:42 - know you had to wear underwear
11:43 - i didn't i brought fisher's price
11:46 - backpack to school which is what babies
11:47 - actually wear
11:48 - and um there were a lot of things i
11:50 - didn't know like i literally didn't know
11:53 - what you're supposed to do with a
11:54 - notebook and everybody had a notebook so
11:56 - there were really weird things
11:57 - for me to learn and high school was like
12:00 - a really weird place
12:02 - same thing happened with me when i
12:03 - started going into and doing math
12:05 - math was so freaking hard for me and all
12:08 - college
12:08 - was really hard and a lot of just
12:11 - learning so
12:13 - going through that luckily for me i
12:15 - always just had a positive
12:16 - attitude so even when people made fun of
12:18 - me i kind of just like laughed it off
12:20 - but i always knew that i had a lot of
12:22 - work to do on myself and they keep
12:25 - going so let me keep going through this
12:28 - a little bit so this is where i'm at
12:30 - right now fast forwarding and this is
12:32 - you know
12:33 - didn't happen overnight and i didn't
12:35 - learn how to do all of this stuff or
12:36 - drink coffee in such a sexy way
12:38 - overnight it took many many years of
12:40 - hard work and learning
12:41 - and that's what i'm really here to show
12:43 - show you guys and talk to you guys about
12:45 - so when it comes to being able to start
12:49 - your own youtube journey and become
12:51 - successful
12:52 - all it comes down to is this one mantra
12:54 - okay and i call this the content content
12:57 - content
12:58 - ask for the sale okay guys so what is it
13:01 - content content content
13:02 - ask for the sale i'm gonna ask you guys
13:04 - and i want you guys to say it with me
13:06 - okay
13:06 - on account of three one two three
13:09 - content content
13:10 - content ask for the sales
13:13 - that's it beautiful i'm loving you guys
13:16 - looking energy
13:17 - thank you guys for giving me that energy
13:18 - i love it so that's all that youtube is
13:21 - and let me show you guys what that
13:22 - actually looks like
13:24 - in reality okay so
13:27 - what you're looking at here is my entire
13:30 - journey with youtube that has helped me
13:32 - make over 2.6 million dollars
13:36 - and what this is over here is i made
13:39 - content and i just shut the [ __ ] up for
13:41 - a really long time
13:42 - and all these yellow markers that you
13:43 - guys see here right
13:45 - you get this is me asking for a sale
13:49 - okay so i made all these videos and then
13:52 - at one point and asked for the sale
13:53 - and when i asked for a sale here do you
13:56 - guys want to guess
13:57 - how much revenue i made when i asked for
13:58 - the sale at that point just take a
14:00 - random guess this was like
14:01 - right when i was starting complete
14:02 - newbie 2k
14:05 - 2k 10 000
14:08 - i was gonna say like three thousand cool
14:10 - so this
14:12 - this first one was i made 47 dollars
14:17 - it sucked um it really
14:20 - it sucked it was like so awful then i
14:23 - asked for a sale a second time i
14:24 - shut up and i kept making content and i
14:27 - asked for a sale a second time
14:28 - do you guys want to take a guess how
14:29 - much i made here
14:32 - 500 2k 500 2k
14:35 - 200. 200. 500.
14:39 - 47 day therefore it can be about 200.
14:42 - so i i made about 20k on this one
14:46 - okay and then this year the last time i
14:48 - asked for the sale do you guys want to
14:49 - guess how much i made the last time i
14:51 - asked for the sale that year in 2017.
14:53 - uh 30k 34 3100
14:57 - 100k okay good guesses good guesses
15:01 - um for this one was actually 150k
15:08 - would would you guys want would you guys
15:10 - like to be able to make a hundred and
15:12 - fifty k
15:13 - in one week yeah yeah yeah
15:17 - sure or any one you want but but let me
15:19 - ask you but let me ask you one difficult
15:21 - thing that nobody actually wants to
15:23 - answer
15:23 - how many of you would like to work your
15:25 - [ __ ] face off and make zero dollars
15:27 - for three months at a time
15:29 - let's go let's go let's go
15:33 - [ __ ] let's go let's go
15:36 - this is the one thing that i want to get
15:38 - real with you on because every
15:40 - other guru and they're trying to sell
15:41 - you some [ __ ] you could [ __ ] do it so
15:42 - quickly
15:43 - that's the one thing that nobody asks
15:45 - you how many of you are willing to work
15:47 - your [ __ ] face off for three months
15:49 - not ask for anything and then you know
15:52 - like if you're okay with that being able
15:53 - to make zero dollars but and truly put
15:55 - in your hard work and soul and energy
15:57 - and put it all on the line
15:58 - if you're willing to actually do that
16:00 - then there are results that you can get
16:02 - so let me ask you guys who are on this
16:04 - call are you actually willing to put in
16:05 - that work
16:06 - yes
16:14 - that's why i want to share this stuff
16:15 - with you guys it's not to brag it's not
16:16 - to do
16:17 - something crazy i would hate to come off
16:19 - like that my whole point is to just show
16:21 - you what's possible
16:23 - that you might be able to do this and go
16:25 - like this is how i did it okay i can't
16:27 - guarantee your [ __ ] but this is how i
16:28 - did it
16:29 - i believe that if you repeat this
16:30 - process it can work and there's some
16:32 - people on this call
16:32 - who did this process it worked for them
16:34 - and now fast forward
16:36 - to 2020 and there are weeks where we're
16:38 - clearing 320
16:40 - 000 in a week which is pretty [ __ ]
16:42 - ridiculous to even say
16:43 - but like it's true because it just

21:17 - yes so that's one thing that we're going
21:19 - to show you in there
21:20 - which is super super value now let me
21:23 - ask you guys a question you can say it
21:24 - out loud
21:25 - if you could quit your job and earn
21:27 - money from youtube to replace your
21:29 - income
21:30 - how much would that be worth to you just
21:31 - say a number how much would it be worth
21:33 - you in a year

22:18 - gonna get four
22:19 - live master classes with me so for you
22:22 - guys

22:36 - to be getting this
22:37 - too and the value of this is four
22:39 - thousand dollars because that's how much

27:47 - how are you
27:48 - i'm doing fantastic and you guys can
27:50 - spotlight me too beautiful
27:51 - so bruce thank you for jumping on here
27:54 - and waiting i'm sorry we didn't have a
27:56 - pleasure
27:56 - exactly on the right time um but talk to
27:59 - me
28:00 - like what why did you start youtube
28:03 - and like just give me a little bit about
28:04 - you sure so
28:06 - so kazzy and i met on a facebook group
28:09 - for of course we were both talking about
28:10 - entrepreneurship
28:11 - and you know i called him up and i
28:13 - thought we were just going to kind of
28:15 - you know share each other's experience
28:16 - but it soon became clear that qazi
28:18 - although much much younger than me was
28:20 - much much more expert than me at
28:22 - digital marketing youtube he was farther
28:25 - down the road than i was
28:26 - and so i immediately um actually hired
28:29 - him as a consultant this is when he was
28:31 - this is
28:31 - 2017 right 2017. three years ago so
28:35 - um and you know we've developed a great
28:37 - friendship and professional working
28:38 - relationship ever since and
28:40 - you know it's kazi's expertise at
28:43 - digital marketing at content creation
28:46 - um at understanding the youtube
28:48 - algorithm and the trends and not just
28:50 - youtube but all the other things that go
28:51 - with it
28:52 - the advertising marketing positioning
28:55 - messaging
28:57 - mindset you know enthusiasm all those
29:00 - things i think
29:01 - qazi is is really extraordinary yet you
29:03 - just have to look at how young he is
29:05 - and how successful he is so you know
29:07 - it's been
29:08 - you know kazi has been instrumental in
29:11 - in my success i was an established
29:13 - professional person already in my job as
29:16 - a college professor
29:18 - but i was absolutely inexperienced on
29:21 - uh social media or content creation
29:24 - bruce
29:25 - you remember that when you were working
29:28 - with me and you would tell
29:29 - you would tell me you're like what the
29:30 - [ __ ] ozzy you're my kid's age and you're
29:32 - here teaching me
29:34 - i remember i would tell like i still i
29:36 - still say that you know you're just a
29:37 - little bit older than my daughter right
29:39 - i'm definitely old enough to be your
29:40 - father
29:41 - but you know a lot more than i do about
29:43 - this stuff i mean part of it is that i
29:45 - spend my job you know being a college
29:46 - professor and
29:47 - i'm a scientist as well so i i have
29:49 - another job
29:50 - kazi spends every waking moment which
29:53 - seems like about
29:54 - 20 hours per day you know thinking about
29:57 - uh digital marketing brand creation
30:01 - content creation all that stuff and and
30:03 - that's why
30:05 - you know he's such a valuable asset now
30:08 - it's impossible given the amount of
30:10 - subscribers kazi has now the amount of
30:12 - demands for his time for people to have
30:14 - him as
30:15 - as a personal consultant the way i did
30:17 - when he was just getting started so i
30:18 - think these courses
30:20 - are are the next best thing where you
30:21 - get the packaged curated
30:24 - uh expertise in addition to the
30:26 - community and the occasional
30:28 - master class and conversation bruce let
30:30 - me ask you are you going to join this
30:32 - course or you got everything that you
30:36 - needed well with my son you know that
30:37 - you and i have a separate contract
30:40 - which uh we're we're helping we're we're
30:42 - literally helping bruce directly we're
30:44 - actually working on his youtube program
30:45 - yeah so bruce let me just tell like ask
30:47 - you like what were the results that you
30:49 - got um
30:50 - you know doing youtube like by yourself
30:52 - like what did youtube do for you
30:54 - right so so with kazzyself i i literally
30:57 - did not know how to start a youtube
30:58 - channel
30:59 - kazzy told me like start a youtube
31:00 - channel i'm thinking well i've got a phd
31:02 - i should be able to do it
31:03 - so i go in and i couldn't figure out how
31:06 - to get it started
31:07 - so cause he literally got me started and
31:09 - then came to my was urging me to make a
31:11 - youtube video in the beginning
31:13 - i was very very hesitant and i've been a
31:16 - professional communicator my whole life
31:17 - i'm not
31:18 - shy but i just couldn't bring myself to
31:21 - hit record and make a video so kazzy
31:23 - came to my house we held up like a lamp
31:26 - from my house and recorded a video on my
31:29 - phone for the first video
31:30 - and that video i i i held up that
31:33 - held the lamp so
31:37 - i was obviously just like helping me
31:39 - spurring me on in the beginning but but
31:40 - the results i got once i started to make
31:42 - videos on a more regular basis
31:44 - you know what it does is it builds your
31:46 - credibility you know you
31:48 - you normally most of us who are in this
31:50 - have some personal branding goal there's
31:51 - some expertise that we have
31:53 - and your presence on youtube gives you
31:56 - credibility and i'll give you an
31:57 - interesting example so
31:58 - i already have a lot of credibility i
32:00 - have a phd i have a job at a major
32:02 - university
32:03 - i have a national reputation as a
32:05 - scientist international reputation but
32:07 - still
32:08 - i had an old colleague who worked for a
32:09 - big drug company who knew me for years
32:12 - this guy knew me for a decade
32:13 - oh [ __ ] i just wanna just one thing i
32:15 - want to say devin just joined
32:17 - let's go david hey is that our first
32:21 - student
32:22 - is that our first student yes yes oh
32:24 - nice
32:25 - oh dang i'm first congratulations
32:30 - you're not going to regret it it's money
32:31 - well spent but so
32:33 - it wasn't until i got on youtube that
32:35 - this guy who i knew for years
32:37 - was my colleague already called me up
32:39 - and hired me to do
32:40 - in that at that particular time a 45 000
32:43 - consultation for four days of work
32:45 - yeah you know and so it would youtube
32:48 - gives you so much credibility in the
32:50 - modern world
32:52 - if you don't have a presence regardless
32:54 - of what you do
32:57 - pardon me kazia i didn't hear that last
32:58 - night i said regardless of what you do
33:00 - it doesn't
33:00 - matter what you do it does not matter
33:02 - what you do i was like how the [ __ ] are
33:04 - we gonna take somebody who's a professor
33:06 - and turn it into youtube
33:08 - and like now you're blowing up on
33:09 - youtube you're blowing up on tick tock
33:11 - it's pretty freaking ridiculous
33:13 - so so so that's what and all the whole
33:16 - time i needed khazi's encouragement i
33:18 - needed kazi's advice
33:19 - kaiser's advice on strategy on tactics
33:22 - on technology i mean there's really
33:24 - no part of this that kazi didn't give me
33:27 - direct
33:28 - and extremely valuable input and bruce
33:30 - you know i think one thing everybody
33:31 - wants to know how much money did you
33:33 - make from youtube
33:34 - like as a direct or indirect result of
33:36 - it i think we calculated yesterday it's
33:38 - something like a hundred and twenty
33:40 - thousand dollars
33:41 - you know it depends sometimes it's not
33:43 - the money doesn't come literally like
33:45 - from youtube adsense or something like
33:46 - that
33:47 - but for me it's a combination of
33:49 - coaching one-on-one coaching
33:51 - consulting contracts i learned how to
33:54 - make a course and then i built and sold
33:57 - a video course yeah and for six figures
34:01 - uh with a partner and then i continue to
34:03 - get adsense revenue and
34:05 - um coaching clients so for it's there
34:07 - are multiple streams of revenue that you
34:09 - get
34:10 - from this kind of business it's not and
34:12 - i encourage everyone to develop multiple
34:13 - streams of ram and kazee and i have
34:15 - plans in 2021
34:17 - to build grow my audience further and
34:19 - and sell a digital product so that's
34:20 - bruce
34:21 - last question before i bring on the
34:24 - other guests because i know devon just
34:25 - joined and i know brian just joined so
34:27 - i'm [ __ ] excited i want to i should
34:29 - step in and
34:29 - i want to bring them on too and i want
34:31 - to just ask you last question bruce
34:33 - would you recommend people working with
34:36 - me
34:37 - or absolutely i i i mean first of all
34:40 - people should know i've invested
34:42 - large sums of money in khazia's as a
34:44 - personal consultant the content
34:45 - consultant i continue to
34:47 - i kazzy and i just closed another
34:50 - business agreement recently
34:52 - for 2021 and and and i recommend them to
34:56 - everyone that i know
34:57 - uh qazi is the best digital
35:00 - marketing content management social
35:02 - media personally they're going to make
35:03 - me [ __ ] cry
35:04 - bruce thank you thank you i love it
35:07 - thank you so much
35:08 - thank you so much he's my friend and i
35:10 - admire him so much his entrepreneurial
35:12 - spirit i have no doubt
35:14 - kazi's success will go through the roof
35:16 - and if you buy this course
35:18 - so will yours but i want to echo
35:19 - something cause he said before he lets
35:20 - me go and that is
35:22 - it's a tremendous amount of work and
35:24 - it's not easy
35:25 - and you know qazi has a tremendous work
35:27 - ethic and if you think you're going to
35:29 - achieve his results without his work
35:31 - you're fooling yourself so i hope people
35:33 - are committed to
35:34 - to investing in themselves and then
35:36 - investing the time because otherwise
35:38 - the money won't be worth it unless you
35:39 - invest your time but it's a fantastic
35:41 - investment

37:35 - what is up amberly what's up baby
37:38 - hi guys this is my beautiful girlfriend
37:41 - so first of all before we get into it
37:43 - give it up for my beautiful girlfriend
37:45 - hey
37:46 - hey so
37:50 - she started her youtube channel and
37:52 - she's now passed
37:54 - 500 subscribers on her way to breaking a
37:56 - thousand subscribers
37:58 - and she even generated over three
37:59 - thousand dollars
38:01 - so [ __ ] cool all right amber lee what
38:03 - is up
38:04 - take it away and just tell us a little
38:05 - bit about you um
38:07 - what's up guys so i am a pro boxer
38:12 - and um and
38:15 - what and my girlfriend
38:21 - i'm actually pretty proud of that and um
38:24 - one of the cool things about being his
38:26 - girlfriend is that i have all this
38:28 - information at my hands
38:30 - but um i was afraid of starting a
38:33 - youtube channel actually at first
38:34 - because even though i'm a professional
38:36 - like a pro boxer and fitness trainer all
38:38 - these
38:38 - things and i'm an actress so i'm used to
38:40 - being on camera i still had like
38:42 - imposter syndrome
38:44 - and um like scarcity mindset like oh
38:47 - there's already so many trainers out
38:49 - there
38:49 - there's no space for me or like um
38:52 - people are gonna tell me i don't know
38:53 - what i'm talking about and i don't know
38:55 - why i was second guessing myself because
38:57 - i actually do know what i'm talking
38:59 - about but there's something about
39:00 - youtube
39:01 - that got in my head and it's like i did
39:04 - it all day on instagram
39:05 - but youtube was this like big scary
39:07 - monster
39:08 - and maybe part of it was like the
39:10 - pressure of um
39:12 - i don't know being positive shadow but
39:14 - he helped me through that
39:16 - through all of that he's like [ __ ]
39:18 - scarcity mindset like
39:19 - he showed me how many other developers
39:21 - are on youtube and then look at what
39:23 - he's doing you know
39:24 - and then he showed me about all the
39:26 - fitness trainers and like
39:28 - if there was only room for one or one
39:29 - blonde female then why would this girl
39:31 - be able to do it
39:32 - and like all of these things and he gave
39:34 - me the belief also in myself that i was
39:37 - lacking
39:37 - for whatever reason and little by little
39:41 - um i started to be like okay i'll do
39:44 - this i'll make a youtube channel
39:47 - and i was also just like really upset
39:50 - and not happy with what i was doing in
39:52 - my life on the daily
39:53 - like i was driving around la to client
39:56 - to client
39:57 - and there's not much you can do to reach
39:59 - more people there
40:00 - there's only so many hours in the day
40:02 - yeah so
40:03 - my overarching goal is to reach
40:06 - millions of people around the world and
40:09 - help them
40:10 - become confident fit have a good mindset
40:13 - mind and body are connected and
40:15 - to grow together i couldn't do that and
40:17 - i was
40:18 - unhappy i felt like i wasn't walking to
40:19 - my purpose but with youtube
40:21 - i can so once i started thinking about
40:24 - it in that way
40:25 - like oh actually i can help so many more
40:28 - people
40:29 - then all the other things oh hajji's in
40:32 - here
40:33 - that's so cute all the other things
40:34 - start to go out the window one second
40:37 - that's our uh french bulldog we bought
40:39 - her with youtube money give it up for
40:41 - our french bulldog
40:43 - [Applause]
40:47 - he doesn't even know what kind of dogs
40:49 - they say they say money can't buy
40:50 - happiness but then i bought her and now
40:52 - i'm happy look at me
40:54 - but keep going baby i don't mean to
40:55 - distract you
40:59 - yeah so now um
41:03 - after making videos like i only have
41:06 - made about eight workout videos so i'm
41:08 - still
41:09 - in the process in the infant stages but
41:12 - i've already overcome so many things
41:13 - like with your guidance
41:15 - baby um and so now and everybody used to
41:18 - tell me you're so lucky you're so lucky
41:20 - like you get to like have coffee at your
41:23 - disposal but now everybody can
41:25 - so last question if somebody's on the
41:27 - fence of working with me or joining this
41:30 - program what do you want to say to them
41:32 - i mean like i
41:35 - don't have enough money in the world to
41:38 - pay for how valuable it's been already
41:41 - um or maybe i'll ask my boyfriend to
41:43 - borrow some money and then pay you
41:46 - um but yeah i i feel like
41:49 - yeah i feel like my confidence
41:53 - even just that getting over fears has
41:55 - been worth it
41:56 - but beyond that now i feel like i have
41:59 - full freedom
42:00 - to build a brand and like be who
42:03 - i always have so would you recommend
42:05 - them to join
42:06 - i mean hell yeah like there's no
42:08 - question about it hey

43:53 - is really going on i keep hitting the
43:55 - arrow button and
43:56 - the list just goes on so this is
43:57 - exciting what's up emery
43:59 - dude this is so [ __ ] exciting uh this
44:02 - is honestly like my dream come true
44:05 - i've always dreamed about us being on a
44:07 - [ __ ] stage and talking and sharing
44:09 - [ __ ] so this is
44:10 - [ __ ] cool uh thank you for being on
44:12 - here you got some amazing results so i
44:14 - want to just talk about like
44:15 - how did you start and and guys for
44:18 - transparency we are brothers so i just
44:20 - want to say that
44:21 - but how did you get started on like what
44:23 - made you start youtube
44:26 - so i mean first of all i'm gonna go back
44:27 - and start it with what amberly said
44:30 - it was one of those things for me as
44:31 - well that you know
44:33 - if you're a working professional which
44:35 - you know i was working as a colorist i'm
44:37 - i'm
44:38 - in the industry doing that and when i
44:41 - saw rafae
44:42 - you know taking that path and just
44:44 - literally launching hardcore
44:47 - it became even harder again just like
44:49 - what am really said because where i was
44:51 - just like
44:52 - now if i try this and if i fail
44:55 - you know not only that you know i suck
44:58 - at this thing that i get paid for which
45:00 - is filmmaking
45:02 - but i can't be as good as my little
45:03 - brother so one of those things like
45:05 - internally that i was just like
45:07 - this is not happening it's for the kids
45:10 - this is where you go to watch cat videos
45:12 - i'm not doing it i was just that
45:14 - ignorant dude you know like in my own
45:15 - head and i think
45:18 - i can speak for a lot of people out
45:20 - there because
45:21 - i started doing it you know um after i
45:24 - was
45:24 - in my 30s so what happens is that you
45:27 - got a family
45:28 - you know you're a working professional
45:30 - and those things instead
45:32 - of helping you giving you more
45:33 - confidence it actually holds you back
45:35 - it cripples you because you're just
45:37 - thinking
45:38 - all the things that i just said you get
45:40 - inside your own head you're just like
45:41 - what if i fail
45:42 - and as we get older we're more afraid of
45:45 - failing
45:46 - okay so you know rafa is there
45:49 - during those times like there i don't
45:51 - think there is one person that can not
45:54 - only hype you up but hype you up with a
45:56 - game plan
45:57 - and help you through every single step
46:00 - of the way i'm talking about
46:03 - it could be as easy as like where do i
46:05 - you know go
46:06 - to start my youtube channel it could be
46:08 - as stupid as that to like your first
46:10 - thumbnail
46:11 - your whole game plan of like video ideas
46:14 - and he will cater that to you personally
46:17 - he will
46:18 - get to know you within like i mean i'm
46:20 - his brother but it doesn't even matter
46:22 - i've seen him talk to like even bruce
46:24 - like bruce
46:25 - is not related to us but when rafi gets
46:27 - to know someone
46:28 - he just goes in and he will tell you hey
46:31 - for you
46:32 - you should do x y and z video on these
46:34 - topics
46:35 - and then just be patient um so
46:39 - i want to ask you one question and i
46:41 - appreciate you for saying that thank you
46:42 - so much
46:43 - and they then some of them who were here
46:44 - they know because i was doing youtube
46:46 - roasts
46:46 - and so i was roasting them and i was
46:48 - just getting in there i want to ask you
46:50 - like tell me about that moment
46:51 - when last year you and i got on that
46:54 - call and i think that was that one call
46:56 - that kind of changed
46:57 - everything like what had just happened
47:00 - that day that was so
47:01 - important and why did we get on that
47:03 - call
47:05 - so i mean it's i've been freelancing
47:07 - since 2012 and the thing with
47:09 - freelancing is that
47:10 - ups and downs right like i mean a lot of
47:12 - you probably know not everybody
47:14 - in this day and age works as a full-time
47:16 - um you know
47:17 - employee so i am freelancing
47:21 - things are great i'm hitting home runs
47:23 - last year i pulled around 234 35
47:26 - 000 so life is great i'm only working
47:28 - 110 115 days out of the year
47:31 - you know getting to do whatever i want
47:33 - outside of that
47:34 - and then all of a sudden like things
47:36 - kind of went downhill and
47:38 - i was you know i was going from like 15
47:40 - 20
47:41 - 000 a month to all of a sudden one month
47:44 - uh one of my biggest clients just pretty
47:47 - much
47:47 - dropped me and i just went from like
47:49 - making 15 grand from them
47:50 - to all of a sudden like 2 500 3 000 now
47:54 - you know in the family we all know each
47:56 - other that we're all hustlers we can
47:58 - make things happen like things will work
48:00 - out so
48:01 - but when this big stuff happens and you
48:03 - got car payments you got a family you
48:05 - got a house like all those things like
48:06 - it hit me really hard
48:08 - and i reached out to rafee he came over
48:11 - and we had that conversation where he's
48:12 - just like
48:14 - hey i want you to now jump on this
48:17 - like just listen to me and like are you
48:19 - ready to do this like can you give me
48:22 - you know a week of your time and can you
48:24 - just like try something and i'm like all
48:26 - right dude i'm all years like whatever
48:27 - you know
48:28 - and he goes i want you to go live on
48:30 - youtube and just talk about your
48:32 - experience
48:33 - and like get into youtube hardcore like
48:37 - just
48:37 - start you know telling people how you
48:40 - can help them
48:41 - what do you do all that stuff and at
48:43 - that point i
48:44 - am like i i've never done this yeah this
48:46 - is not what i do and when you're like a
48:48 - behind-the-scene guy
48:49 - it's not easy to be in front of the dude
48:51 - i remember you calling me that day and
48:52 - you're like oh man
48:54 - they just dropped me and you were
48:56 - [ __ ] freaked out
48:57 - and i remember i put you on mute and i
48:59 - was like [ __ ] yes because i knew that
49:01 - that was the day
49:03 - like you could actually just go all into
49:05 - youtube so it was kind of [ __ ] up but
49:07 - then i got back and i'm like oh [ __ ] man
49:09 - i'm so sorry that that happened to you
49:11 - no no this this sick bastard was
49:16 - [Applause]
49:19 - but not to mention that every time that
49:21 - happened in my life and and this is just
49:22 - like a little tangent but i do want to
49:24 - tell people that if you're
49:25 - in a part of your life where you kind of
49:27 - feel like you got punched in the gut
49:29 - and kind of feeling like what i'm
49:30 - explaining to you these moments
49:32 - are the best moments okay it's hard for
49:35 - us to see it as humans we just look at
49:36 - this and we just go
49:38 - this is the worst thing ever happened to
49:39 - me poor things happen to me you know oh
49:41 - sad little me but the thing is that
49:43 - these things are the best opportunities
49:45 - in your life so yeah that's what he's
49:47 - talking about i went live did my
49:49 - and it was really stupid at the time i
49:51 - literally had like hundreds of followers
49:53 - and i had like 80 or 70 or 80
49:56 - followers showed up like subscribers
49:58 - showed up on youtube to watch that video
49:59 - which blew my mind i'm like how am i
50:01 - getting this much traffic i only have
50:03 - like
50:03 - 150 subscribers or something yeah that
50:06 - gave me the boost
50:07 - um i finished my life and another thing
50:09 - that i want to talk about raphael is
50:11 - that
50:12 - the thing is that he's he's like a shark
50:14 - in a positive way
50:16 - that he's always smelling the blood like
50:18 - when he sees someone that
50:20 - okay they are on a high they felt
50:23 - something and like they're feeling good
50:25 - he will literally smell that latch onto
50:28 - it and just take you to another another
50:30 - level okay as soon as that happened
50:32 - i did my life this dude didn't let off
50:35 - the gas like he was just like okay now
50:37 - we just gotta go left right punch like
50:38 - we got to keep going
50:40 - so i mean i don't know you're amazing
50:42 - and talk about it
50:44 - bro this is amazing i appreciate that so
50:46 - much and just like i guess share some of
50:48 - the results you've gotten
50:50 - as a result of like growing your youtube
50:52 - like revenue
50:53 - or whatever so you know then
50:57 - we start off you know he guided me
50:59 - throughout the entire thing
51:00 - and literally did not hold anything back
51:03 - he just went like if i
51:05 - was starting out this is what i would
51:06 - have done so
51:08 - you know let's keep talking about like
51:09 - him as a mentor too because obviously
51:11 - like you know this is
51:12 - his platform and that's what he's going
51:14 - to be offering to you if you were to
51:15 - join so one of the biggest things was
51:17 - that
51:17 - he was just like i i wouldn't make these
51:20 - mistakes today so
51:22 - then you should do it like this way that
51:24 - way right so when i started hitting it
51:26 - hard on youtube
51:27 - um another good thing about rafa is that
51:30 - this is the guy who's making it happen
51:32 - he's a practitioner he's not just a
51:34 - teacher
51:35 - i don't go on his youtube channel and he
51:37 - has 300 followers but then he's doing
51:39 - all this big talk and like pumping us
51:41 - on i go to his youtube i go to
51:44 - socialblade put in the numbers
51:45 - and i go what is going on i mean this
51:47 - guy is pulling more subscribers than
51:49 - like peter mccannon in a month like
51:52 - my brain is just like blown so then i'm
51:54 - just like
51:55 - okay follow this lead like keep going
51:58 - and uh yeah like he said in a year we
52:00 - went from
52:01 - uh two or three hundred followers 234
52:04 - 000 we hit 134 000 last night damn
52:08 - wow we're everything we're averaging
52:10 - about delicious bro that's [ __ ]
52:12 - guys give it up for him that's so sick
52:14 - all right keep going i'm listening
52:16 - we're averaging about four to five
52:18 - hundred a day
52:19 - um and um on instagram you know we're
52:22 - sitting at
52:23 - i think we should be hitting 220k today
52:26 - so i mean that
52:27 - you know is also an excellent platform
52:29 - and again raphael was a huge huge help
52:31 - and inspiration because
52:33 - i was just looking at what he's doing
52:35 - and then just kind of
52:36 - kept and again go keep going back to
52:39 - that i think the biggest success that
52:41 - even he's going to talk about
52:42 - is that talent you know could be a
52:45 - commodity
52:46 - right but i mean hard work is a rarity
52:49 - that's one thing
52:50 - that you know uh say that again bro say
52:52 - that [ __ ] again
52:53 - that is beautiful that's the only truth
52:56 - right like i mean talent is a commodity
52:57 - people can be very talented how many
52:59 - people rafa you and i know that like
53:01 - literally [ __ ] on us but the
53:02 - problem that they're not hitting home
53:04 - runs day in and day out they do it for
53:06 - one day
53:07 - and they're out of gas yeah and that's
53:09 - just something that rafa and i get to
53:11 - see a lot because he has students and i
53:13 - have students
53:14 - and when i see some people that they
53:15 - have so much potential i'm like dude
53:18 - you could be 100 times me i'm giving you
53:21 - all the things that i have all you have
53:22 - to do
53:23 - is just do this much of it every day
53:26 - keep doing it for a year
53:27 - see where you go that's the secret like
53:29 - do it do it well and then just do it
53:31 - forever
53:32 - we had reynold just [ __ ] joined dude
53:34 - so that's [ __ ] sick hey
53:36 - let's go riddle and we had frank just
53:39 - joined that is so awesome
53:40 - and last thing i want to ask you bro
53:43 - what would you say to people who are
53:44 - thinking about this course they want to
53:46 - join it they've been like they saw this
53:47 - whole presentation and saw people jump
53:49 - on
53:49 - but they're like right there on the
53:51 - fence what would you say to them
53:53 - i mean i'm gonna say like what i've
53:56 - to this day i'm you know picking up so
53:58 - much from rafa first of all he's like my
54:00 - baby brother right
54:01 - but in our family we don't have that
54:03 - thing we learn from each other we don't
54:05 - bring like egos in the way or anything
54:07 - like that
54:08 - and the thing that i see with him is
54:10 - that
54:11 - he will give his hundred and forty
54:13 - percent to be there for you
54:15 - but on top of it he is building a team
54:18 - around him
54:19 - that are basically a lot of rafas
54:22 - like you know in this culture like that
54:25 - are as hyped
54:26 - and that are as willing to help you so i
54:28 - mean
54:29 - what's going to happen is that you will
54:33 - go
54:33 - from like you know thinking about should
54:36 - i do it
54:36 - i mean maybe i'll do it because i want
54:38 - to refund blah blah blah and in 15 or 20
54:40 - days later you're gonna see your results
54:43 - and you're just going to be what took me
54:45 - so freaking long because guys
54:47 - these numbers are real right a million
54:49 - dollars in a year i mean that sounds
54:50 - like a joke it literally sounds like
54:52 - it's we're playing an infomercial here
54:55 - but this is just
54:56 - the world that he can help you create
54:59 - and make it happen because rafa starts
55:02 - where
55:03 - people you know where the rara ends is
55:06 - where he starts and then it just goes to
55:08 - a whole another level okay and
55:10 - he's got a whole team to back you up so
55:12 - i genuinely feel like
55:14 - it is i mean it's without a doubt he's
55:17 - my brother but i'll probably pay for it
55:19 - because i like
55:20 - to pay for you know whatever it is that
55:23 - i'm doing because then i paid that much
55:25 - more attention to it you know because
55:26 - like the money came out of my pocket
55:28 - than
55:28 - getting it for free so i mean i don't
55:30 - know dude i mean i haven't like no words
55:32 - 134 gets
55:33 - subscribers on youtube 220k on instagram
55:37 - 1.16 mil like in the you know so i mean
55:39 - it's just too much to mention
55:41 - so i mean it's just you know that's it
55:43 - dude that's [ __ ] this is in the
55:44 - pudding
55:45 - proof is in the pudding so that's that
55:46 - bro thank you so much

56:20 - much for being here
56:21 - uh this is so crazy bro like i said to
56:23 - my brother i'm like this is like a dream
56:25 - come true you're
56:26 - one of my best friends and to be here
56:28 - live bro this is something we [ __ ]
56:30 - dreamed about you know
56:31 - in our basement when we used to work
56:32 - together that had [ __ ] ate
56:34 - [ __ ] like garyvee would say and you know
56:37 - half the time you
56:38 - were what sleeping in your [ __ ] car
56:40 - right that's right
56:42 - that's right so talk to me brother talk
56:44 - to me just a little bit about like your
56:46 - i guess background with uh you know
56:48 - youtube and how you got started on it
56:51 - i guess we should start from ground zero
56:54 - right sure so over it
56:55 - causing me we've known each other since
56:58 - like college
56:59 - at oakton community college when he had
57:01 - 2.0 gpa and i had 2.7 gpa
57:04 - right so we're not 4.00 way to shove it
57:07 - in my face bro
57:09 - come on dude that's that's how we sell
57:12 - it
57:12 - that's how we sell ourselves bro yeah
57:14 - but we started we
57:16 - we met there and then you know i've been
57:18 - i've been doing digital marketing way
57:20 - before him
57:21 - but you got me on it you got me on i got
57:24 - i remember the day he was learning how
57:26 - to spell entrepreneurship
57:28 - yeah right and how to say
57:30 - entrepreneurship
57:31 - and i was already on neil patel ramit
57:34 - sethi i showed him to like all these
57:36 - guys
57:36 - all these big guys online but the thing
57:39 - about him is that
57:40 - as what cause said as like you've seen
57:42 - you've heard from himself and like
57:44 - amberly and a lot of other people
57:46 - is that he's really good at execution as
57:49 - well
57:50 - like he's not just somebody like he's
57:52 - not just like spitting [ __ ] and
57:54 - pulling it out of his ass and like just
57:56 - make it sound
57:57 - good in theory like he's a practitioner
58:00 - and that's why you can see the results
58:02 - on his numbers because at the end of the
58:03 - day that's
58:04 - that's the thing that matters you know
58:05 - the the reason why he is here today
58:08 - on a call during this launch all this
58:11 - is because he is an executioner not just
58:14 - a visionary
58:16 - so that's i mean i feel like you know
58:20 - that that is the most important thing
58:21 - because a lot of people there there are
58:23 - a lot of programs out there right now
58:25 - on youtube and stuff like that but i
58:28 - i smell a lot of bs but with you bro
58:33 - like even from the first day i've i've
58:35 - been with this guy from
58:36 - day one like day one what you guys
58:39 - will be going through when you get that
58:42 - first subscriber
58:44 - when you get that first three
58:46 - subscribers a day when you hit that
58:48 - first seven subscribers a day and you
58:50 - get that feeling like this weird
58:53 - butterfly like butterflies going in your
58:55 - stomach
58:56 - that i've seen him go through that and
58:58 - then he's just
58:59 - and i'm like bro that's that's that's
59:01 - something dude that's not a fluke that
59:04 - that's potential and he would just play
59:06 - it off and he would just say
59:07 - bro i don't know that that might be an
59:09 - anomaly yeah it might be
59:10 - i didn't know what anomaly meant i
59:12 - learned after that i'm like oh that's
59:14 - what it is
59:14 - but like that's what i'm saying you i've
59:17 - seen this guy go
59:18 - through that but the thing again like i
59:20 - said he's the hardest working person in
59:22 - the room
59:23 - every single time i have not met a
59:26 - single person
59:27 - in person who is more hard working who
59:30 - is more aligned with his vision
59:32 - who is more hungry who's more positive
59:34 - who's more consistent
59:37 - than anybody else and that's why he's
59:39 - where he
59:40 - he is at today right thank you but
59:43 - dude like i i
59:46 - what i gotta say bro i appreciate i
59:48 - appreciate that i appreciate that so
59:50 - much bro thank you so much and
59:52 - just i i want everybody to hear also
59:54 - like uh your youtube channel and just
59:56 - like the results that you've gotten from
59:58 - starting your own youtube channel can
60:00 - you drop a link real quick
60:02 - so we can check it out oh yeah it's
60:03 - called it's called what's dev on youtube
60:05 - yeah i'll drop it right here what's dev
60:07 - and it's actually a channel
60:08 - for developers
60:12 - so go ahead and you can talk about it so
60:15 - um i was doing consulting work and
60:18 - teaching code
60:19 - in person right through wise and take
60:21 - lessons we were both doing it we both
60:23 - started learning how to code
60:24 - and then i hit rock bottom so i started
60:26 - like spending like 16 hours a day
60:28 - i would like actually see sleep in this
60:30 - basement on the couch
60:32 - and we would code all night all day
60:33 - every day like for pennies like not even
60:36 - earning like pennies
60:37 - for a long time and then like i couldn't
60:40 - afford to pay for gas
60:42 - and then i made it i just started doing
60:44 - consulting work
60:45 - you know i started i mean i even worked
60:47 - with a billionaire
60:48 - like portillos that was insane i don't
60:50 - know if you guys from chicago but
60:51 - anywhere from chicago but like
60:53 - it's a fast food chain and they sold the
60:56 - chain to uh bertrand hathaway for a
60:58 - billion dollars
61:00 - but again right with with consulting
61:02 - work it's not you can't scale that and
61:04 - all that but
61:05 - let's go back to youtube the reason why
61:07 - i bring it up is because
61:09 - i saw this guy start youtube right and
61:11 - i'm like i've always wanted to start
61:13 - youtube but never pulled the trigger or
61:15 - i pulled the trigger but
61:16 - never actually believed in it and so i
61:18 - never committed
61:19 - and i'm like it's it's not going to work
61:21 - for me you know i would watch marquez
61:22 - brownie mkbhd
61:24 - and like not me and i would have i
61:27 - i had so many insecurities imposter
61:29 - syndrome
61:30 - how to talk on the camera and things
61:32 - like that but
61:34 - when i saw this guy go through his
61:36 - videos
61:37 - when i saw him like create his first few
61:39 - videos
61:40 - forget his first few subscribers and i
61:43 - remember the day
61:44 - he hit 47 subscribers a day
61:48 - and i and and a light switch went up in
61:50 - my head
61:52 - and i'm like this is this is going to be
61:54 - big
61:55 - and then within two months he was at 12
61:57 - 000 subscribers
61:58 - oh yeah and again right more like people
62:01 - talk about views a lot like subscribe
62:03 - subscribers and all that that yeah it
62:06 - matters but
62:07 - more important is like what is that
62:08 - doing to your business or your life like
62:10 - directly
62:11 - like so let's talk numbers right i
62:14 - remember the first day he hit his
62:15 - 20 000 launch and of course the 47
62:18 - dollars
62:20 - and he he had tears in his eyes not
62:21 - gonna lie like
62:23 - this is facts like this is true story
62:25 - like he had
62:26 - tears in his eyes like it was like bro
62:29 - i just made my first sale and he's like
62:31 - 47 47
62:33 - and he was hugging me i'm like bro that
62:34 - was a special moment i i always tell her
62:36 - i always tell people i'm like that
62:38 - gratefulness is like a secret super
62:40 - power you know like at the
62:41 - the 47 like the the first two
62:44 - subscribers i got that also made me cry
62:47 - and that's another thing about this guy
62:49 - he's very grateful
62:50 - he he is the most grateful person in the
62:53 - room every time like i'm this is not
62:55 - exaggeration
62:55 - because when i get a 297 dollar sale or
62:59 - like 497 dollar sale
63:01 - i'm gonna be like pretty cool you know
63:03 - when i first started making
63:04 - sales online i'm like that's pretty cool
63:06 - but when this guy
63:08 - got his first sale he actually took it
63:10 - to heart and actually like
63:11 - lived and appreciated that you know and
63:13 - i feel like that
63:14 - really says a lot about his success
63:16 - today but let's go back to that first
63:18 - day like
63:19 - when you hit your first 20 000 launch i
63:21 - was there and that was the moment
63:23 - i was like i'm gonna go youtube
63:24 - full-time because that was the day you
63:26 - believed that maybe
63:28 - this isn't just a hoax like it could be
63:30 - possible for you too
63:32 - right and it's not it's not it's not
63:34 - like i didn't know
63:35 - yeah i knew in it in my head right it's
63:38 - like
63:38 - in theory every in theory there's no
63:41 - difference between theory and practice
63:43 - but in practice there is wow so
63:47 - when i saw that when i saw this guy pull
63:49 - in 20k
63:50 - live in front of my eyes in 20 minutes
63:53 - in 20 minutes back to back i was like
63:56 - all right
63:57 - i'm going to be in i'm not going to bs
64:00 - anymore
64:00 - and then i went to do full again for
64:02 - youtube full time
64:04 - and now the rest is history and i don't
64:07 - work on my youtube
64:08 - like at all like probably in the last
64:10 - like 10 months i've released one video
64:12 - but now i've found a secret like i've
64:14 - found a flow and i'm doing
64:15 - a lot of other things but to date
64:19 - from that very first date i pull it
64:21 - pulled in over 400k in revenue
64:24 - 437 or something like that is amazing
64:26 - but
64:27 - but it all started i would have never
64:30 - started
64:30 - if it wasn't for this guy because i
64:33 - would still be in my head
64:34 - i would still be insecure little kid i
64:37 - would still be
64:38 - like coming up with a bunch of excuses
64:41 - and
64:41 - reasons for how oh i can't do it or like
64:44 - oh you know i can always do it later or
64:46 - like whatever the excuse it is
64:49 - yeah i would be coming up with it and i
64:51 - wouldn't be here today without you bro
64:52 - so thank you more than anything i'm glad
64:55 - to be here but
64:56 - yeah but but like most importantly dude
64:59 - i like the most important thing that uh
65:02 - when i saw
65:02 - amberly when i saw cos like what cost
65:05 - like go through that journey
65:06 - like dude thank you damn bro and
65:10 - and this is like and i i feel like i'm
65:13 - i'm saying this for a lot of people when
65:14 - i say that
65:15 - bro you have been the single biggest
65:20 - impactful person in my life
65:24 - no joke because youtube was that
65:26 - breaking point where i'm like

65:33 - local area you know like

65:51 - almost wanted to be like bro [ __ ]
65:52 - want to grab some coffee after this
65:54 - but i know you're in chicago so that
65:55 - kind of sucks but dude thank you so much
65:58 - and
65:58 - last thing i guess i want to just ask is
66:00 - would you recommend somebody who's on
66:02 - the fence to jump into this program
66:05 - um i mean dude again results speak for
66:08 - themselves
66:09 - and if you don't like the thing is you
66:11 - can always do it for free right you
66:12 - you can find resources you can find
66:15 - whatever you guys on reddit
66:16 - it's on reddit yeah go on reddit
66:18 - whatever right but the thing is
66:20 - will you do it will you actually have a
66:23 - youtube channel
66:24 - with 133 000 subscribers or not even
66:27 - about subscribers but
66:29 - again all it takes is a few clients to
66:31 - make six figures
66:32 - yeah you you don't have to have
66:34 - thousands of subscribe
66:36 - subscribers i can't even talk now
66:37 - because i'm so excited but
66:41 - will you have that channel will you have
66:43 - a back-end funnel
66:44 - with products with your services that
66:47 - are ready to sell
66:48 - knowing exactly what you should be doing
66:50 - at
66:51 - what point and all that stuff yeah if
66:54 - you want if
66:55 - will you have that that's the big
66:56 - question in theory again
66:59 - you probably know this already you
67:00 - probably you can probably google that
67:01 - and get the answer
67:02 - but with qazi you will actually
67:06 - have it damn for 12 months that is huge
67:09 - that's the difference
67:10 - dude thank you so much for coming on
67:12 - guys this is what's the
67:13 - tension give it up for attention hey
67:15 - thank you so much brother i appreciate
67:17 - you bro
67:18 - thank you thank you thank you that was
67:21 - awesome bro thank you um i still want to
67:24 - grab that coffee
67:26 - attendance day can i piggyback off sure
67:28 - sure go for it
67:30 - um so what he was saying about like
67:32 - having the guidance that
67:34 - tells you when to do what like how to do
67:36 - something when
67:37 - like drop this video with this title
67:40 - that stuff
67:40 - is crucial because you can figure it out
67:42 - on your own and like take shots in the
67:44 - dark but it's going to take 10 times as
67:46 - long if not more you'll probably get
67:47 - frustrated and quit before that time
67:49 - yeah so like for example i just want to
67:51 - use a tic-tac video for example too
67:53 - because you've helped me on all
67:55 - platforms we're growing everything at
67:57 - the same time
67:58 - and we just dropped a tick tock video
68:00 - that i was like nah this is not going to
68:02 - do anything
68:03 - and it's sitting at 250 000 views right
68:05 - now
68:06 - with like over 20 000 likes and comments
68:09 - and all this and i
68:10 - i just started tick tock so it's like
68:13 - i believe in everything now i'm like ah
68:15 - [ __ ] it it's not
68:17 - yeah you actually know what you're doing
68:18 - so for everybody else who is on the
68:20 - fence like
68:22 - save your time this money is nothing in
68:24 - comparison to
68:26 - the blow up that's about to happen for
68:27 - you yeah if
68:29 - they can follow your guidance thank you
68:30 - so much i really appreciate you thank
68:32 - you for that thank you thank you thank
68:34 - you
68:34 - and guys um i want to bring on a few
68:36 - people who
68:38 - joined on this um on this first of all
68:42 - guys i just want you to give it up for
68:43 - our guests that
68:45 - were on here that was so amazing of them
68:47 - and you know
68:48 - i didn't pay them they came on for free
68:50 - they give us their valuable
68:52 - valuable time i know what it's worth so
68:53 - i don't take that for granted thank you
68:55 - guys for being here and sticking around
68:56 - for that
68:56 - and now we're going to be getting into
68:59 - something pretty cool so
69:01 - um guys i want to bring on people who
69:03 - actually just joined on this call
69:06 - but a few people just joined on this
69:07 - call and i want to say guys
69:09 - i'm going to take on just a few more
69:10 - people and once i hop off
69:12 - this call the price of the program is
69:15 - going to go up from 9.97
69:17 - and it's going to go up to 1297 and it's
69:19 - going to be there forever
69:20 - so again not a tactic or a hack it's
69:23 - just like an incentive to be able to
69:24 - join earlier so i'm going to take on a
69:26 - few people that jumped on
69:27 - in the program so i believe frank did
69:30 - you join the program on the call
69:32 - i just joined guys three easy payments
69:34 - seriously
69:35 - it's so talk to me what made you join
69:38 - frank
69:38 - what made you actually pull the trigger
69:40 - it's yeah it's a it's that little that
69:42 - little build up
69:43 - for the five day was kind of like a like
69:45 - a taste of what happened
69:47 - like guys you see this mic i just got
69:49 - this mic i got a
69:50 - the the vz1 camera i'm ready to go like
69:54 - real for real nice dude that's sick
69:57 - i i don't know how to do color
69:58 - correction on it yet i don't
70:00 - i look like like a smurf on there it
70:02 - looks crazy but
70:04 - you know we look beautiful you look
70:05 - beautiful no this is just a webcam i got
70:08 - like a 4k bro
70:09 - oh [ __ ] but i think i think this is what
70:13 - it is it's like
70:14 - it's it's very similar to what uh tenzin
70:16 - was saying it's like
70:18 - you know i i'm a senior developer
70:22 - and i i have literally making bank
70:25 - i literally have reached the tip top of
70:28 - what you can charge a client i don't
70:30 - think it's possible to charge more
70:32 - how much how much you how much you
70:33 - making right now just let them know flex
70:35 - on them
70:36 - bro i mean you know 175k
70:40 - nice awesome so here's the thing
70:43 - but here's the thing it's a little nine
70:44 - to five thing and it has
70:46 - its own peaks and it goes up and down
70:48 - too so i think it's like
70:50 - i want to smooth that out yeah and i
70:52 - don't like to work for people
70:54 - like i love the projects i do yo i'm
70:56 - working on the sonos app it's gonna get
70:58 - like a million downloads on day one
70:59 - damn you know it's gonna bank for sure
71:02 - but
71:03 - how how many more of those clients can i
71:05 - get like realistically
71:07 - yeah not many i've already built every
71:09 - app that everything by the way five more
71:11 - minutes guys
71:12 - so we're gonna get the price up in that
71:13 - time so if you can make a decision
71:15 - that'd be fantastic but keep going frank
71:16 - i'm listening to you
71:17 - so that's like so so like how can i take
71:20 - my knowledge
71:21 - and instead of having a thousand you
71:22 - know instead of having one person giving
71:24 - me a thousand bucks a thousand people
71:26 - giving me one dollar it's way better
71:28 - yeah it's way better and i don't
71:30 - i don't like this grind i don't like the
71:31 - sales cycle of getting new clients and
71:34 - making the app and all this other stuff
71:35 - it's like i want to break out of that so
71:37 - it's not like
71:38 - it's not like i i absolutely need
71:41 - youtube
71:41 - yeah but i want to do youtube correctly
71:44 - and it's like what's the point like why
71:45 - would i just struggle on my own to do
71:47 - this
71:47 - yep like kazzy's gonna hook it up like
71:50 - what it's a no-brainer for me dude i
71:52 - [ __ ] love it bro
71:53 - thank you so much bro for jumping in the
71:55 - program and we're gonna do those
71:57 - coaching calls so get ready now it's
71:58 - time to [ __ ] work bro
72:00 - it's it's work time for sure all right
72:02 - bro thank you guys give it up for frank
72:04 - that was sick
72:05 - um now we're gonna bring on a few more
72:07 - people that have jumped in so
72:09 - brian i think brian jumped in i believe
72:11 - devin jumped in everybody who jumped
72:12 - into the program
72:14 - just say it down below uh who was that
72:17 - reynold
72:18 - no my name is dudley okay cool so drop
72:21 - your names in the chat and we're gonna
72:23 - like bring you on

72:27 - yo first of all thank you for having me
72:29 - on i did threaten to throw hands if i
72:31 - didn't get put on this call
72:32 - hey [ __ ] thank you for respecting that
72:34 - you know
72:36 - oh yeah he is actually a black belt so
72:38 - thank you for jumping on devin
72:40 - and talk to me why did you take the leap
72:42 - of faith and jump in this program
72:45 - actually yeah as i was saying in the
72:47 - chat earlier that
72:49 - really out of all the coaching that i
72:51 - bought from like different youtubers
72:52 - this probably had the least
72:54 - amount of resistance as far as me making
72:57 - a purchase
72:58 - and the reason for that is just because
73:00 - one i've
73:01 - seen you work i've seen you on youtube i
73:03 - found you on youtube
73:04 - yeah and everything that you're saying
73:06 - as far as like do you want to learn this
73:08 - i'm like yes
73:09 - i know you know as you're speaking to me
73:11 - i'm like i'm being sold
73:13 - but it's so good i need to learn that
73:16 - and that's what i understand i love that
73:19 - bro that is illegal
73:20 - that's what i respect and love when i
73:22 - see people and i know i'm being sober
73:24 - it's like bro you're so good like i
73:26 - really do need to learn guys by the way
73:27 - three more minutes and guys let's give
73:29 - it up for robin that just joined and
73:30 - melissa just joined so that's [ __ ]
73:32 - sick but three more minutes till the
73:34 - price goes up guys three more minutes
73:35 - keep going devin yeah and so and
73:39 - actually just here before joining this
73:41 - call i was actually
73:42 - i was working on a video for um
73:45 - uh to application for the for the cpu
73:48 - job and i was like yo i really do need
73:50 - these skills
73:51 - i'm like struggling this is freaking
73:53 - difficult yeah i just
73:54 - figured out how to lower the game
73:57 - whatever on my mic
73:58 - so yeah the game on my mic so i don't
73:59 - sound so crazy yeah and i'm like
74:02 - let me just see what this game is you
74:03 - sound pretty good how does he sound
74:04 - right now guys does he sound good
74:06 - sounds pretty good to me yeah sounds
74:09 - pretty good
74:11 - and these are things i just learned from
74:12 - your like five day youtube challenge
74:14 - and i've had this mic and i've had this
74:17 - green screen for like two years now
74:19 - and i barely started my youtube like
74:21 - last
74:23 - month yeah just now starting to like
74:26 - actually
74:26 - think wise as far as what i want to make
74:28 - yeah and as
74:30 - some of the others have said on here you
74:31 - can do it on your own like i learned
74:33 - programming on my own
74:34 - do all tutorials and it took me like you
74:36 - know like a decade practically before i
74:39 - you know yeah start making these high
74:41 - salaries whereas
74:43 - when people are offering you this
74:45 - information
74:46 - so you can skip you know that length of
74:48 - time yeah
74:49 - it's like you why not that's what money
74:52 - is for
74:52 - it's it's an exchange time for money
74:56 - i want to save time i want to you know
74:59 - learn the skills i need
75:00 - to grow my business because i'm tired of
75:03 - working for these companies and i
75:04 - hear in your voice like you sincerely
75:06 - want to help people
75:08 - like me it's
75:11 - literally the weirdest thing but i tell
75:13 - this to my brother
75:14 - um that when when uh this happened with
75:16 - tenzin and this happened with my brother
75:17 - the moment my brother got his first sale
75:20 - as a result of youtube and the day i
75:21 - realized that he believed that it was
75:23 - real for him
75:24 - i started just [ __ ] crying i remember
75:26 - that day
75:28 - it is like it's weird it makes me like
75:30 - emotional i can almost feel the impact
75:32 - that you're gonna make and how it's
75:33 - gonna change your life and other
75:34 - people's life so like
75:35 - i deeply believe it and it gets me
75:37 - emotional and i get goosebumps when i
75:39 - see like people actually going at it
75:43 - and and i could feel that like that
75:45 - resonates
75:46 - through the mic and like that energy
75:48 - that you have is not like
75:50 - manufactured you genuinely have this
75:53 - compassion for people that you want to
75:55 - share you're just able to actually
75:57 - harness it
75:58 - and that's how i feel because i want to
75:59 - help people i enjoy teaching
76:01 - i've worked for boot camps and you know
76:04 - i've done tutoring
76:05 - at the same time i'm making you know x
76:07 - about an hour
76:08 - where it's like where can i just harness
76:10 - this care that i have for people i want
76:12 - to
76:13 - you know educate and i want to be able
76:15 - to entertain and i want to be able to
76:17 - portray that without
76:18 - being in my head and last question for
76:21 - you devin
76:22 - because i know people other some few
76:23 - other people want to jump on so thank
76:25 - you for that

76:41 - community helping you and pushing you
76:43 - that you will not have if you try to do
76:45 - it on your own

84:52 - out loud and i know
84:54 - that there's potential of those types of
84:56 - channels to crush it on youtube
84:59 - and so that's what i'm telling her like

85:02 - on youtube i think it will do really
85:03 - well so that's why i really believe that

85:31 - so talk to me reynold why did you join
85:33 - this program
85:35 - yeah so i've created like some content
85:38 - for some other company like linkedin
85:40 - learning
85:41 - um and now i recently wanted to start
85:42 - creating more content for myself
85:44 - um instead of just courses uh for them
85:47 - because i'm independent so i wanted to
85:48 - grow my
85:49 - youtube channel so i started putting
85:51 - some content out there but
85:53 - wasn't putting out as much as i wanted
85:55 - yeah
85:56 - and i've seen your videos before like
85:58 - before i even heard about the youtube
86:01 - challenge and and i also saw like the
86:04 - video with you and john sonmez and i'm
86:06 - i'm a big fan of his nice and so like
86:08 - you kept
86:09 - kept coming across kept coming across
86:12 - and then i'll just
86:13 - damn this guy like really knows the
86:15 - stuff he's doing up pretty well
86:16 - yeah what really got me was when you
86:18 - started doing um
86:21 - courses that were well i forgot the term
86:24 - that you use but basically when you
86:25 - created your own
86:26 - amazon your own netflix those clones
86:29 - yeah
86:30 - clones i was like god damn it yeah
86:33 - that's exactly
86:33 - you kind of like think like me like i
86:35 - never thought in terms of clones but
86:36 - i've always thought that more
86:38 - courses should be building full
86:40 - applications yes
86:42 - it's just about liking the way that you
86:43 - think and then also the way that you i
86:45 - like market it
86:46 - yeah and then when i challenge i'm just
86:47 - like look at all this energy and the
86:49 - work that he's putting into this yeah um
86:52 - also what i want to do is exactly what
86:54 - you're teaching so i'm just like it's
86:56 - kind of a
86:57 - no-brainer and it's to push the extra
86:59 - push that i need so
87:00 - i just jumped on and i'm looking forward
87:03 - to it dude that's beautiful dude i love
87:05 - your confidence
87:06 - go ahead go ahead the other thing that
87:08 - was a big sell
87:09 - is the fact that you mentioned the
87:10 - consultation because
87:12 - they were like i know it's like a video
87:14 - course you'll cover a lot of stuff
87:15 - but i noticed some things that i'd like
87:17 - to know better like how
87:19 - you market do you use the traditional
87:22 - funnel and stuff like that so
87:23 - i figured i'd have the opportunity to uh
87:26 - you'd give students priority like to
87:28 - answer questions like that you know how
87:30 - you end up like marketing also in
87:32 - addition to just
87:33 - creating videos am i right there yeah
87:36 - yeah yeah
87:36 - got it that's beautiful yeah no
87:38 - definitely all those things i'll be able
87:39 - to help you out with
87:40 - and that's the beautiful thing about
87:43 - those calls where you guys
87:44 - are connected directly with me because
87:46 - i'll just be like reynold this is your
87:47 - problem work on this
87:48 - you know melissa work on this any
87:50 - questions you guys have i'll be able to
87:52 - just directly answer and that was
87:53 - something
87:54 - nas and i think it was nas that was like
87:57 - dude
87:58 - why wouldn't you just do live coaching
88:00 - with them and i'm like
88:01 - wouldn't like i want to do the course
88:04 - but like you think they
88:05 - even want coaching like maybe they just
88:07 - want the course he's like what the [ __ ]

88:10 - do the live coaching with them and i'm
88:11 - like okay i'm like all right i'll do the
88:14 - live coaching and so then we just

88:18 - because i love coaching
88:20 - i've been doing it for a really talk
88:22 - long time in my life and i love teaching

89:13 - your video
89:14 - your video experience was awesome i
89:16 - loved your uh
89:17 - instagram story one especially that was
89:20 - really cool how you held up the sign or
89:22 - the five day challenge and then you have
89:23 - the mic
89:24 - really great energy so hi and talk to me
89:27 - about
89:28 - why you joined this program
89:31 - um so i joined this program because um i
89:34 - think for 10 years now i've actually
89:36 - been writing on my goals list that i
89:39 - want to create a youtube challenge
89:41 - and i'm like okay i think a decade is
89:44 - enough
89:46 - guys give it up if you think a decade is
89:48 - enough
89:49 - [Applause]
89:50 - nice i love it and
89:53 - you spoke to me directly um when you
89:56 - said
89:57 - um that we each have value to bring
90:00 - yeah um so that that just like
90:03 - little fire nice i remember that
90:05 - specific moment there was something you
90:07 - were asking about
90:08 - bringing value and you were confused and
90:10 - i asked she said something guys and it
90:12 - was
90:13 - money and she said like two sentences
90:15 - and she's like i'm afraid i won't be
90:16 - able to like how do you know if you can
90:17 - bring
90:18 - value and then she said a few things
90:20 - that were really valuable i just stopped
90:22 - the call and i asked everybody i'm like
90:23 - guys
90:24 - a few sentences she just said do you
90:26 - think it was valuable and i'm like
90:27 - if it wasn't don't [ __ ] say anything
90:29 - but if it truly was raise your hands
90:31 - and like almost everybody just like
90:33 - raises their hands they're like
90:34 - i'm like look at that i'm like that
90:37 - tells you that that was valuable and so
90:39 - if we found that valuable we're lucky to
90:41 - be in this environment we
90:42 - where we can actually speak to each
90:44 - other back and forth most of the times
90:46 - we're not in that environment you're
90:47 - never going to get that feedback until
90:49 - you're a big youtuber
90:50 - but you're not going to become that big
90:52 - youtuber if you don't go through that
90:54 - small
90:54 - so that's why i really enjoy this
90:56 - environment that we've created and
90:58 - i'm glad that you like listened to that
91:00 - moment
91:02 - and so go on yes i've taken a lot of
91:05 - value from your course
91:06 - and i would like to help other people
91:08 - like um my brother
91:10 - he's currently laid off or he's
91:12 - currently looking for a job he quit
91:14 - teaching but yet he's still tutoring
91:16 - because
91:16 - yeah that's what brings him money yeah
91:19 - and i know that if i could learn this
91:20 - and show him that it can be done yeah
91:24 - i think he could impact other lives but
91:26 - i think it would just create a ripple
91:27 - effect
91:28 - and it gets me really excited about it
91:31 - it's exciting and i like that you're
91:33 - excited i see that smiling
91:35 - i started it and you see my brother
91:37 - started it
91:38 - right i brought my brother on this call
91:40 - and it was a dream
91:42 - i used to dream about this i brought
91:43 - tens of my friend on this call too and i
91:45 - used to dream that one day we're all
91:47 - going to be able to share
91:48 - something of value and we're going to be
91:50 - on a stage and i've
91:51 - i've had this vision for many years and
91:53 - today we were able to make it a reality
91:56 - and if there wasn't covet we would be
91:58 - having this in like real life
92:00 - i would love to meet each and every one
92:01 - of you but i i do believe that it's
92:03 - possible
92:04 - and so it starts with the belief that
92:07 - it's possible and then
92:08 - you actually end up doing it right so i
92:11 - love that i love that and
92:13 - talk to me like if somebody was on the
92:15 - fence and they were like thinking about
92:17 - it what would you say to them
92:19 - um i think i guess i would pose the
92:22 - question of
92:23 - what will your life look like if you um
92:27 - did follow through and then think about
92:30 - that
92:30 - so damn i love that
92:34 - beautiful i love that that is so
92:37 - powerful rocio thank you so much for
92:39 - coming on guys give it up for
92:40 - a seal
92:44 - beautiful thank you amazing energy
92:46 - awesome
92:47 - let's do this um we had i think robin
92:50 - also
92:51 - joined hi robin
92:55 - all the way from where where are the
92:57 - southern where those the northern lights
92:59 - norway all the way from norway
93:02 - yeah exactly well actually vermont right
93:06 - amazing thank you so much for jumping on
93:08 - and uh robin talk to me
93:10 - why did you join this pro youtube
93:12 - program
93:14 - um i wasn't expecting to talk um
93:18 - well there you go step one why because i
93:21 - i really
93:22 - want a youtube channel and i've been
93:24 - thinking about it for
93:26 - like a year but i'm really stuck on
93:28 - knowing the name
93:29 - so i need someone to like be sticking me
93:31 - with a stick to say just pick something
93:33 - and go with it
93:34 - beautiful wow so a virtual stick
93:38 - yeah virtual stick okay got it we'll
93:40 - we'll do some
93:41 - animations in the video um okay
93:45 - i'm so i'm so glad that you finally made
93:47 - that decision
93:48 - but why did you decide to make that
93:49 - decision now when you could have made
93:51 - you know like why not do it before what
93:54 - specifically was it that made you decide
93:55 - now
93:57 - um well because the program is like um
94:00 - having a coach like someone on the other
94:02 - side or sitting next to you saying oh do
94:04 - it this way or do it that way so it's
94:06 - more like the personal interaction
94:08 - instead of being a passive
94:10 - course where you just read online and
94:13 - you just do it at your own pace
94:15 - this way you have somebody actually um
94:18 - guiding you motivating you yeah um
94:22 - critiquing you a sort of a live coach
94:25 - yes beautiful right and so then you have
94:28 - the other people in the class or the
94:30 - other people
94:31 - um to support you and then you support
94:33 - other people so it actually stimulates
94:35 - your create
94:35 - creativity yeah you have someone to play
94:38 - off of instead of just a dead
94:41 - passive screen that doesn't speak back
94:43 - to you yes
94:44 - i agree i couldn't agree with you more
94:47 - i've
94:47 - been in so many courses myself but
94:49 - because they're not a breathing living
94:51 - organism it's just recorded videos
94:53 - there's just something about it that
94:54 - doesn't work for me
94:56 - so having that like live experience i
94:59 - think is really
95:00 - powerful and you'll have a community of
95:02 - people that is also going to be there
95:04 - to support you so thank you so much for
95:06 - your trust robin and jumping in the
95:08 - program
95:09 - you're going to be blown away but with
95:10 - value and
95:12 - any last words in terms of like would
95:14 - you recommend somebody else maybe who's
95:16 - experiencing the same type of hesitation
95:18 - you were and what would you say to them
95:19 - to get them off the fence
95:21 - um i would say that the advantage of
95:24 - doing this
95:25 - course is that it gives you added energy
95:28 - to do it like sometimes you can't move
95:31 - but this actually gives you extra energy
95:34 - that you didn't have before so you can
95:35 - actually
95:36 - just uh tune into someone else's
95:39 - enthusiasm and go with it yeah you know
95:42 - sort of like fake it till you make it
95:44 - yeah yeah and that you can't do that on
95:47 - your own if you can't get
95:49 - off your butt to do something now you
95:52 - just tune in yes i love
95:55 - that um even i was so scared to jump in
95:58 - the water have like
95:59 - crazy fear of water my girlfriend was
96:01 - just standing there like supporting me
96:03 - yelling at me recording me with the
96:04 - video and she finally got me to do it
96:06 - and so it reminds me of that which is
96:09 - it's hard to sometimes
96:10 - do it on your own if you get that little
96:11 - push it helps you get through
96:13 - thank you so much robin for coming on
96:14 - and guys give it up for robin
96:16 - thank you i appreciate you so

97:52 - i do sell so i'm super like kind of like
97:56 - really kind of like hesitant because i i
97:58 - like sell products and stuff before but
98:00 - like
98:01 - yeah i'm ready to kind of just like i'm
98:02 - tired of just doing like the individual
98:04 - [ __ ] no no hold on hold on one second
98:06 - hold on one second
98:07 - i want to share this video with people
98:08 - because this video was super freaking
98:10 - cool
98:11 - thank you man i appreciate it unexpected
98:13 - like i didn't even predict this at all
98:15 - so this was his video experience for the
98:18 - youtube challenge we actually did
98:20 - i was humble as possible
98:24 - what oh
98:27 - oh [ __ ]
98:31 - wow my brother yeah yeah yeah this is i
98:33 - i know aaron from like he used to live
98:35 - here so i know him for a while back wow
98:37 - that is crazy
98:39 - bro that is so amazing was he
98:42 - okay okay i'll ask you more questions
98:44 - later i want to give back people
98:45 - questions later
98:46 - okay cool so let's take a look at this
98:48 - video this video was awesome and i
98:50 - really appreciated that right
98:51 - now who wants to go next we'll go next
98:55 - i own act let's go okay all right my
98:58 - favorite part was that uh where i
99:00 - am you made two [ __ ] videos
99:05 - i love that
99:10 - so yes me being stupid so yeah yesterday
99:12 - it was um
99:14 - you know he he was on the call with me
99:15 - or two days ago and we did our
99:17 - we were doing gross and so my rose to
99:19 - him was i'm like dude
99:21 - your biggest problem is you only did two
99:22 - [ __ ] videos you can't grow with that
99:25 - so i wanted him to do more i believe
99:28 - that he had a lot of like great
99:29 - potential
99:30 - and uh your video experience video was
99:32 - really really cool um
99:34 - i i really enjoyed it so talk to me what
99:37 - made you join this program bro uh i was
99:40 - very hesitant
99:41 - because this i've been selling basically
99:43 - i would say like all my life pretty much
99:45 - very hesitant about buying somebody
99:47 - else's course but um
99:49 - i i can see the potential and the value
99:52 - that you bring to all these other people
99:53 - yeah just the way that you're doing it
99:55 - and
99:56 - i believe that the way you've gone about
99:59 - in the other days
100:00 - even though i weren't there you're very
100:02 - transparent yeah you're very kind of
100:04 - just like open
100:05 - it's just like here is like how much
100:06 - profits i made here's everything
100:08 - yeah you're not really kind of just i
100:10 - felt anyway you're not really like
100:12 - giving me the run around you're not
100:13 - bsing it's kind of just very
100:15 - you're just open with everything so
100:17 - that's why i was just like
100:19 - do i want to do i have the money yes do
100:21 - i want to
100:23 - kind of just keep making individual
100:24 - sales and not extend my profit goals or
100:27 - do i want to maybe
100:28 - finally after like many years of not
100:31 - picking a mentor because it's always
100:32 - about money
100:33 - yeah do i want to maybe invest money and
100:35 - a mentor to kind of just
100:36 - be able to just reach those financial
100:38 - goals already instead of
100:39 - doing things on my own and i will say i
100:42 - was pretty decent
100:43 - yeah just doing [ __ ] on my own for the
100:44 - longest time yeah and maybe
100:47 - just hiring a mentor again it's just
100:48 - like it's a grand
100:50 - it's something small yeah do i have the
100:51 - potential to make more down the future
100:53 - yes so beautiful i love see if we can
100:55 - just go with him and see
100:56 - what happens that's a really good way to
100:58 - think about it and that's the thing
100:59 - right like a lot of people who sell a
101:01 - lot they become really jaded
101:03 - and that's like a difficult path to go
101:05 - down like you you know because you're
101:06 - like i sell a lot so like now you are
101:09 - always really hesitant to be sold to
101:10 - it's kind of a weird [ __ ] thing
101:12 - but this is the thing about like
101:14 - opportunity it's weird even for me
101:17 - uh in 2019 i stopped taking any
101:19 - mentorship
101:20 - like 2019 was the year we grew the most
101:22 - and i stopped taking any program any
101:24 - mentorship and i just put my head down
101:26 - and executed
101:27 - 2019 and had like the craziest results
101:29 - and in 2020 i was getting great results
101:32 - i hired one mentor and that mentor gave
101:35 - me the decision to like
101:37 - literally i remember it was like uh you
101:39 - know do you know nas that's on our team
101:40 - who's right behind me yeah yeah i mean i
101:44 - see him i don't personally know him but
101:45 - okay
101:46 - what's up brother he's saying what's up
101:47 - brother so um
101:49 - bringing on nos full time i remember
101:51 - asking the mentor i'm like you know it's
101:53 - gonna be a big investment like what do
101:54 - you think blah blah
101:55 - that mentor just looked at me and he was
101:57 - like that's the dumbest question you
101:59 - have ever asked me i'm like what do you
102:00 - mean he's like [ __ ] do it put your
102:02 - money where your mouth is and i was like
102:03 - oh okay i called nas and i was like bro
102:06 - you want to work with us full time he's
102:08 - like
102:08 - hell yeah i was like hey let's go
102:11 - and it was the best decision of my life
102:13 - and literally all i needed was just
102:15 - permission
102:16 - like all i needed i knew everything that
102:18 - i needed to do i just needed permission
102:20 - in some way and that exploded
102:22 - and that's how so the mentors i look for
102:25 - now is i really want to make sure
102:26 - they have the result i want and they
102:29 - really have the integrity and core
102:31 - values that i'm after
102:32 - because everybody can show you how to
102:34 - make a quick buck but it's really hard
102:36 - to get people who
102:37 - truly tell you to make the right
102:38 - decisions in your life
102:40 - and in the business that you're after so
102:43 - i mean i just want to say i thank you
102:45 - for taking the trust and actually
102:47 - pulling the trigger
102:49 - last question i want to ask you is some
102:51 - you know you were hesitant and you were
102:52 - thinking about it what would you say to
102:54 - somebody else who's maybe in the same
102:55 - exact
102:56 - damn place and thinking about it what
102:58 - would you say to them
102:59 - i would i would personally for me
103:02 - whenever i make a decision that this is
103:03 - just always good long-term advice for
103:05 - anybody
103:05 - just always make sure to do your due
103:07 - diligence and if you feel like
103:10 - the person you're with is like you know
103:12 - whatever you're buying from or whatever
103:13 - if you feel like it emotionally moves
103:15 - you in a certain way
103:16 - then also make sure like does it
103:18 - logically make sense but also
103:19 - you know way between those two different
103:21 - things yeah they make a decision from
103:23 - that
103:24 - aspect you know you know like study
103:26 - learn
103:28 - get information and if it sounds
103:30 - credible it sounds good go for it that's
103:31 - what i would personally
103:33 - say in my opinion thank you brother and
103:34 - i just want to say your videos are
103:36 - pretty cool
103:37 - i uh somehow reach out to me on that
103:40 - tech service or whatever
103:41 - or ask um aaron but i would love to
103:44 - somehow find a way
103:45 - to do videos together thank you yeah all
103:48 - right brother thank you so much for
103:49 - coming on and guys give it up for ionic
103:51 - thank you brother
103:54 - all right appreciate you so much uh

104:00 - joined and
104:01 - if there's anybody else we can bring on
104:04 - um
104:09 - okay cool so i believe some of the
104:12 - people have
104:13 - left because we went on for a little bit
104:14 - of longer time so guys now what i'm
104:16 - going to get into
104:17 - is i'm going to do a few q a and again i

104:29 - only for
104:30 - one i want to make it something so it
104:32 - gives you no hesitancy to join
104:34 - and two it's you taking a vote of
104:36 - confidence in me
104:38 - and jumping in so i want to like just

105:47 - back when you was doing the freelancing
105:49 - stuff whoa are you serious
105:52 - nah straight serious serious serious
105:55 - wait what was
105:55 - about what um you was talking
105:58 - freelancing with coding and um
106:00 - i i don't know if you remember but i was
106:02 - saying like i'm an electrical engineer i
106:04 - was talking to this dude
106:05 - mit blah blah blah you probably get so
106:07 - much phone calls
106:08 - damn bro that is crazy that was like
106:11 - before i started youtube
106:13 - really no no i'm just asking you when it
106:15 - was okay okay cool
106:16 - go ahead well i was caught on with the
106:18 - clever programming because um
106:20 - i i loved the idea i actually thought
106:22 - that like you know
106:23 - because i was making programs science
106:25 - technology engineering math for like
106:26 - students and stuff like that
106:27 - yeah and then covet happened got it so
106:30 - i'm i'm thinking like this
106:32 - like um i don't know if you're still
106:33 - gonna go back to
106:35 - that but um when i bought your course
106:38 - i felt like um it was really great it
106:40 - gave a lot of content but
106:42 - um i just didn't know enough about
106:44 - coding as um
106:46 - a software engineer person should should
106:49 - so i was just saying like
106:50 - going back towards like you know maybe
106:52 - this has nothing to do with the youtube
106:53 - yeah
106:54 - yeah i'm just like what what would you
106:57 - say about that because i feel like it
106:59 - was more so like it was spoon fed but i
107:01 - wanted to get to know
107:02 - more maybe i just missed out on like
107:05 - some content that you had
107:07 - i was like how could i be much more
107:08 - driven that way man
107:10 - into software engineering yeah because
107:13 - um
107:14 - like i would follow the way like with
107:16 - python because i have a couple books
107:17 - over here too
107:22 - okay awesome thank you uh so let's
107:26 - put everybody on mute and then we can

107:48 - tons of people that are joining
107:50 - our community and just from our free
107:52 - content on youtube
107:53 - landing jobs of software developers so i
107:56 - would say
107:57 - please make sure go you're making all of
107:59 - the projects that are won in the course
108:01 - and on on our youtube and then two the

109:18 - are relevant to
109:19 - you is it related to youtube

109:31 - ever
109:32 - damn thank you bro i appreciate it thank
109:34 - you i appreciate that
109:35 - thank you and second thing is that my
109:38 - dream is to become the india's most
109:40 - you can say all-rounder youtuber yeah so
109:43 - uh
109:44 - back in 2019 i started my youtube
109:47 - channel named 14x
109:49 - and to enable monetization there are two
109:51 - conditions like
109:52 - you must have one thousand subscribers
109:53 - and four thousand versus watch time
109:55 - yeah so i have completed one goal four
109:58 - thousand hours of watch time
109:59 - but i have currently only uh 825
110:02 - subscribers
110:03 - just short shorting about 175
110:06 - subscribers
110:06 - so i want a short review on my youtube
110:10 - channel can you please
110:11 - do that for me simple review so right
110:13 - where i'm lagging
110:15 - cool so um okay sure why don't you drop
110:17 - your channel
110:18 - real quick and right now i'm not gonna
110:19 - be getting into roast but drop the link
110:21 - to your channel
110:23 - yeah one for can you please search it
110:25 - it's very simple one for tech only one
110:27 - for four t e c h drop um
110:31 - drop the name and chat bro just so i can
110:34 - i can spell it correctly
110:38 - let's see okay perfect that's
110:41 - that's helpful thank you so i don't see
110:44 - it in chat
110:46 - one for tech okay cool cool got it so
110:48 - i'm gonna take a look at this
110:50 - i'm not doing rose right now maybe if we
110:53 - run out of questions then we can take a
110:54 - look at that
110:55 - but i'm just going to take a look at
110:56 - this so one for tech 29
110:59 - uh videos and um
111:02 - one of my videos has got around 85 000
111:05 - views okay so let's take i'm looking at
111:07 - this channel right now
111:09 - 86 000 views top five apps okay cool so
111:13 - your big problem that i see here is that
111:16 - you're not making more of the content
111:17 - that worked
111:18 - so for example you found something that
111:21 - worked and then you
111:22 - looked at it you zoomed into it you were
111:25 - like i got the results from it and then
111:27 - you're like nah i'm not gonna [ __ ] do
111:28 - it
111:29 - that's the problem that i see a lot of
111:31 - people do why their channels don't grow
111:33 - including myself like literally myself i
111:36 - do the same
111:36 - exact thing so you need to what worked
111:40 - for you
111:40 - keep repeating that forever as much as
111:43 - possible so like
111:45 - i need to see top five like next
111:48 - 12 videos for the next 12 weeks like
111:50 - literally top five something
111:52 - they're going to do it yes if you do
111:54 - that you're gonna blow up okay so
111:56 - look at where you got successful and
111:58 - what worked that's the best place for
112:00 - you to then just
112:01 - like hunker down and go hard okay yes
112:04 - is there any mistakes in my thumbnails
112:06 - or titles um i would say that it's
112:09 - really busy so there's too much going on
112:11 - here and here
112:12 - like too many logos too much look at the
112:16 - best channels don't look at channels
112:18 - that are like crappy look at the best
112:19 - performing channels
112:21 - and look at their thumbnails and what
112:23 - you'll see is they're these clean
112:25 - simplistic thumbnails most of the time
112:27 - so you can model traversing media
112:29 - you can model clever programmer you can
112:31 - model free code camp
112:32 - i mean in the coding whatever industry
112:34 - tech industries are
112:36 - tons of people you can model but make it
112:38 - clean and simple
112:39 - don't add so much text like this is
112:42 - better
112:43 - but still like it's it's a lot so i
112:46 - would i would go the simpler route okay
112:48 - look at mosh
112:49 - so that all right brother and you're
112:51 - gonna fly past you're gonna fly past a
112:53 - thousand subscribers like within this
112:55 - this month if not the next month okay

113:32 - you're thinking about joining that
113:33 - course right now would be the best time
113:35 - before the price

113:50 - make sure that the value is happening to
113:52 - you like for you guys
114:08 - you're gonna have questions about
114:09 - youtube you can have questions about
114:11 - monetization
114:12 - you can have questions about um what
114:15 - type of content
114:16 - uh equipment because i have a question
114:20 - frank go for it bro uh so i think um as
114:23 - part of the course like i know we're
114:24 - gonna be learning for sure
114:26 - like how to do like like shooting and
114:28 - like the animated part like
114:30 - are are you guys also gonna go into like
114:32 - how to create the funnels how to do like
114:34 - like kajabi i think it's called like all
114:36 - that fun stuff
114:37 - would you want that in the program we
114:39 - were thinking about adding that to the
114:40 - program
114:41 - yeah because like for me it's like i i'm
114:43 - sure i'm sure
114:44 - at some point i will figure all this out
114:46 - cool
114:47 - okay but then like how do you how do you
114:49 - get the bag right
114:50 - so here's what i was i'm gonna say right
114:52 - because it's a pre-launch
114:53 - this course is gonna be dripping out to
114:55 - you guys okay
114:57 - so uh this is your guys's votive you're
114:59 - still gonna be getting the
115:00 - uh group coaching but the course is
115:02 - gonna be dripping out so this is perfect
115:04 - if you guys tell me i can add in some
115:06 - extra things or bonus modules for you
115:07 - guys
115:08 - i would really love that i was that
115:10 - that's what i was going to ask during
115:12 - the coaching too
115:13 - okay so we're going to actually start
115:14 - writing all of this down so give me one
115:15 - second nas can you start writing all of
115:17 - this down in one place bro
115:18 - yeah okay so they want kajabi and like
115:22 - how to launch a core slash
115:23 - funnel how that works okay basically the
115:26 - marketing along with yeah the marketing
115:28 - yeah like how do you write the emails
115:30 - like emails
115:31 - what do you put on there what do you put
115:32 - in the emails okay
115:35 - the funnels sorry i didn't mean to
115:37 - interrupt you can keep talking
115:39 - cool yes just just basically like the
115:40 - marketing part is kind of like
115:42 - that would be like super valuable for me
115:44 - and i think a lot of people
115:46 - um maybe i think you said something
115:48 - about the equipment
115:49 - like equipment okay so equipment will
115:53 - cover that in the course and i remember
115:54 - you said like and i like that too like
115:56 - budget
115:57 - and then medium budget and then like um
115:59 - and baller
116:00 - and there's a payment plan too so if you
116:02 - guys want to do a three-month payment
116:04 - plan
116:04 - if you guys want something that's a
116:05 - little bit but frank go for it
116:08 - yeah so um i think i think it's like
116:10 - yeah and of course
116:11 - as as we're growing it's like you know
116:14 - to jump on your channel like
116:15 - who knows right to get more subscribers
116:17 - i don't know it's like a thousand
116:19 - what is it a thousand a thousand
116:21 - subscribers and
116:22 - four thousand hours hours watching that
116:24 - sounds like a lot
116:25 - it is it is a lot it is a lot so here's
116:29 - one thing i will tell you guys
116:30 - when you guys are growing your channel
116:32 - and parker walbeck says this too
116:34 - who has a great youtube channel and he
116:35 - says like
116:38 - in a weird way he's like never look for
116:39 - collaborations it's pretty weird advice
116:41 - i was like what the [ __ ]
116:42 - but i kind of agree with that because
116:44 - what happens is
116:45 - you want your channel to be growing on
116:49 - its own
116:50 - because you might get on my live stream
116:53 - and you might get some views so you get
116:54 - that like little spike and rush but then
116:57 - if the videos are not good it's not
116:59 - going to keep growing it's just going to
117:00 - stay there
117:01 - so you want it to be able to grow on its
117:03 - own like genuinely
117:04 - on its own how i think of like collabora
117:06 - if you need collaborations to grow it's
117:08 - kind of like if you needed ventilators
117:09 - to breathe
117:11 - you want to learn how to breathe on your
117:13 - own and become your own organisms you
117:14 - want your channel to grow on its own
117:17 - um and then people will reach out to you
117:19 - or you can reach out to people you know
117:20 - for sure if you want to do that
117:22 - because you're specifically in the
117:23 - coding niche
117:25 - if you make content that's really
117:27 - valuable and i genuinely believe it's
117:28 - valuable
117:29 - i would put it on not even as a favor to
117:31 - you because you're a student
117:33 - genuinely because i believe that it will
117:34 - be valuable for clever programmer
117:36 - audience
117:38 - so yeah i'm open to that if you actually
117:40 - make something that's banger it's good
117:42 - we're like yo this
117:44 - matches our metrics of like what's good
117:46 - we'll put it on yeah
117:48 - very cool very dope awesome
117:52 - awesome um do you recommend like if you
117:54 - were to ever
117:55 - i mean you're gonna go through that in
117:56 - the in the modules as well like building
117:59 - a course and filming and stuff
118:00 - yeah do you recommend uh building a
118:03 - website
118:04 - with your own brand or do you recommend
118:05 - something like udemy
118:07 - some sort of your platform your own
118:09 - you're all
118:10 - your own yeah 100 000 because with udemy
118:13 - what's really
118:14 - awful is you don't even get access to
118:16 - the email list
118:17 - like literally that's that's so crazy to
118:20 - me like you own no part of the business
118:22 - i'm like
118:22 - i was gonna do something with them and i
118:24 - was like yo i'll make a course for you
118:25 - guys
118:26 - um and i mean i even put out something
118:29 - on there by mistake and i think it has
118:30 - like 80 000 or something 90 000
118:32 - enrollments
118:34 - and um i asked them i'm like yo what do
118:36 - you guys
118:37 - you know if i drop the course how does
118:38 - it work and they're like yeah like
118:40 - you can launch it here and you know all
118:42 - this and i'm like can i reach out to my
118:44 - people and
118:44 - they're like um no and i'm like can i
118:47 - get this email list
118:48 - outside and reach out they're like no
118:51 - i'm like
118:52 - okay so so basically
118:56 - you pay you pay them if you don't
119:00 - you drop a course on there if you don't
119:01 - really know how to do marketing
119:04 - but you'll make pennies compared to what
119:06 - you can actually make if you
119:08 - spend time learning marketing and
119:10 - because you already have experience
119:11 - selling i think you're going to enjoy
119:12 - the marketing aspects so i would
119:14 - recommend for you ionic like
119:16 - host it on your own thing and i
119:17 - recommend people use kajabi because it's
119:19 - the simplest platform
119:21 - uh you know to have your website and the
119:23 - course
119:26 - yeah if you want to go simpler than that
119:28 - even like
119:29 - even simpler i had my brother get on
119:31 - podia
119:32 - so polio is really really simple but i
119:35 - use kajabi
119:36 - and you know i i recommend people kajabi
119:39 - because
119:40 - when you scale it is a good platform to
119:44 - have makes sense
