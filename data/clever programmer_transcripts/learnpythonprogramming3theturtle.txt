00:00 - - Okay, in this video, I wanna talk about
00:02 - the turtle.
00:04 - So, "What is the turtle?"
You might be asking.
00:06 - Well, we're gonna find out.
00:08 - Before we get into some of the more boring
00:11 - or the technical stuff,
which is actually really fun,
00:13 - but before we get into that, I want you
00:15 - to be able to visualize the code.
00:17 - I want you to be able
to see that what we type
00:20 - and what we do, you can
do something fun with it
00:23 - right away, okay?
00:25 - And, this is not just
something for, maybe,
00:28 - kids, this something that's
gonna be very valuable,
00:31 - I don't care how old
you are, even if you're
00:33 - two hundred years old
because visualization
00:36 - is a key tool.
00:37 - So if I show you that now,
I think it's gonna benefit
00:40 - you in the long run, and
also sometimes when you're
00:42 - confused about things,
you can try this thing out
00:45 - that I'm gonna-- about
to show you right now,
00:48 - to
00:49 - maybe make those examples and concepts
00:52 - more concrete that you might
be a little hazy about.
00:55 - Without further ado, let's get started.
00:57 - So, what we are gonna do is start
01:00 - doing something with the turtle.
01:02 - So, I want you to do "import
turtle" as your first line.
01:05 - Okay?
01:07 - Import, this secret command here,
01:10 - what it means is that some programmers
01:13 - who stayed up really late
at night and wrote code
01:16 - and ate Ramen noodle, and
that's all they did, they
01:20 - spent hundreds and thousands
of hours writing all this
01:22 - code for you, and you just get to steal it
01:25 - by typing in "import."
01:27 - So basically think of it like you have
01:29 - amazing powers at the tip of your fingers
01:31 - by using this command "import," and you
01:33 - get all those powers, okay?
01:35 - Let's do
01:37 - my turtle is equal to turtle dot turtle.
01:41 - Okay?
01:42 - And, what we're gonna
do is we're gonna say
01:44 - my turtle dot,
01:49 - I don't know, let's do something simple
01:51 - like move,
01:52 - or sorry,
01:53 - forward
01:54 - 100.
01:57 - Alright, so let's see what
02:00 - just
02:00 - happened.
02:03 - Alright, what is going on there, right?
02:05 - Let's close that; let's start it again.
02:07 - So, I'm gonna write this line again,
02:09 - and we're gonna kinda do
like a slow motion, okay?
02:11 - We're just gonna play it out again.
02:13 - So, I said my turtle,
02:17 - right after this first
line that I did, right?
02:19 - My turtle showed up here, okay?
02:23 - Just to make it even clearer for you guys,
02:24 - I'm gonna start this thing
again, and I'm just gonna write
02:27 - the first line that I wrote.
02:28 - So, you can see, my
turtle showed up, okay?
02:31 - Now, let's say I'm gonna
do my turtle dot move,
02:35 - or sorry, I keep saying, "move."
02:37 - Let's do forward, and let's do 100, yeah?
02:41 - Let's try it; let's see what happens.
02:43 - Did you just see that
thing go to the right?
02:46 - So, that thing went to the right.
02:49 - Now, what if I wanted to move it up?
02:51 - Well, what you need to do is, essentially,
02:54 - it's like...
02:56 - Okay, it's like this.
02:57 - I want you to look at my face right now.
02:59 - So if I'm the turtle, and
I'm going in this direction
03:04 - here, I will go like this much,
03:06 - and then, in order for me
to turn left, what I need
03:09 - to do is first turn 90 degrees left,
03:13 - like this,
03:14 - and then to move forward,
I just go forward, right?
03:17 - Like
03:19 - that.
03:20 - Okay?
03:21 - So we're gonna do that with our turtle.
03:23 - So let's do my turtle dot
left, how many degrees?
03:28 - 90 degrees.
03:30 - 'Kay?
03:31 - Now, if you notice the turtle,
now it's facing towards
03:34 - the left, and it's looking at going up.
03:36 - So we simply
03:38 - do
03:39 - my turtle
03:40 - dot forward
03:41 - 100 again.
03:43 - And you can see my turtle
is right over here.
03:48 - Now let's do some more fun stuff.
03:50 - Let's say my turtle dot
03:52 - right
03:53 - 50,
03:56 - and let's say my turtle
04:00 - dot forward
04:02 - again 100, and you can
see we're starting to make
04:05 - interesting shapes now, right?
04:07 - Like, what is that?
04:10 - Maybe it could be a shirt, it's a ladder,
04:14 - I don't know.
04:15 - I don't know what that is.
04:17 - But, here's what I want you to do.
04:19 - I want you to create a
square with the turtle, okay?
04:23 - And I want you to copy
whatever code that you wrote,
04:26 - and I want you to paste
it in the comments.
04:28 - So, either if you're
watching this on YouTube
04:30 - or if you're watching this on my website,
04:32 - on Clever Programmer, I want you to go
04:34 - to "Exercise 2: The Turtle"
on cleverprogrammer.com,
04:38 - and I want you to literally
copy whatever code
04:42 - you have and paste it here, okay?
04:44 - I read every single one of your comments,
04:47 - and I will go through it,
and I will comment on it.
04:49 - And other people will get to
see what you're up to as well.
04:52 - Okay?
04:53 - Also, on my website, I have
linked you guys to a blog
04:57 - that says "Read this on
how to do more fun things
04:59 - "with the turtle!"
05:01 - Okay?
05:02 - So if you go to this blog, it'll teach you
05:05 - what more fun things you can do, okay?
05:08 - So it teaches you how to create stars
05:10 - and some really fun shapes, okay?
05:13 - So, that is it for this video.
05:16 - I will see you in the next video.
