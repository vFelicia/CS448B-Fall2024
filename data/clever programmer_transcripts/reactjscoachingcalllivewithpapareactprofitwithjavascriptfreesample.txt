02:58 - things like soft skills we're going to
03:00 - be covering how you can make money with
03:01 - coding
03:02 - so a lot of us are here to make money
03:04 - with coding right
03:05 - one sec uh sunny you're sharing your
03:07 - settings screen right now
03:09 - oh really the zoom settings yep oh damn
03:12 - okay
03:12 - oh you can't actually see my no no no so

03:22 - there we go okay i have an idea there we
03:26 - go
03:27 - that's better so okay so
03:30 - now let's go ahead close this close the
03:32 - settings that we have
03:34 - awesome so that's better right um now
03:37 - it's just your desktop
03:38 - okay yeah we're good we're good now
03:40 - we're in a good position okay
03:41 - so guys what i'm gonna do is i like to
03:44 - use the whiteboard a lot
03:46 - okay so um we're going to pretty much go
03:48 - ahead and
03:49 - i'm going to teach you a bunch of things
03:50 - today we're going to go ahead and run
03:51 - through
03:52 - different different kind of topics so
03:54 - the first thing is can you
03:55 - you guys can see this right i'm not yeah
03:58 - okay
03:58 - so what we're going to do guys is we're
04:00 - going to talk about the three ways to
04:02 - make money okay
04:03 - so firstly we're all here to make some
04:05 - money right so three ways to make money
04:07 - with code
04:08 - now i always like to start with this
04:10 - because it kind of gives you like a
04:11 - direction or like some kind of road map
04:14 - as to where you you can kind of like you
04:16 - know piece together everything because
04:18 - right now
04:19 - we're all inside this call to learn how
04:21 - to code and then with the end
04:23 - result of making money or doing
04:24 - something in that matter right
04:26 - now a lot of us kind of think about the
04:27 - angle as being a final like a permanent
04:30 - job right so
04:30 - reason i'm going to put it down here is
04:32 - because i actually consider that as step
04:34 - three
04:35 - where most people consider this a step
04:36 - one but the permanent job and we usually
04:38 - refer to this like a nine to five sort
04:39 - of position
04:40 - this one is going to be the job where we
04:43 - pretty much all aim to sort of get to
04:44 - right we all kind of want to get to
04:46 - this as our end goal but what i would
04:49 - say is that there are two more things
04:51 - that we can do here right
04:52 - we actually have one avenue here and we
04:53 - actually have another avenue here now
04:55 - these two avenues are actually huge
04:58 - right there
04:58 - i mean i actually to this day um i work
05:01 - with clever programmers so pretty much
05:03 - we have that's my sort of like permanent
05:05 - gig
05:05 - and then we have uh um positions one
05:08 - and positions two i pretty much go ahead
05:11 - and i use
05:12 - every single day to go ahead and
05:13 - generate some additional income sorry
05:15 - it's sunny
05:15 - yeah sonic can just give a check uh if
05:18 - youtube is going live or is it like
05:21 - clocking
05:22 - no no i mean dude don't worry too much
05:24 - uh it will be fine like because
05:26 - if it's recording afterwards but the
05:28 - main value here is towards
05:30 - the students so that's going to be the
05:31 - main thing yeah so don't worry too much
05:32 - about that
05:33 - okay so here we have the three ways to
05:35 - make money with code okay so the first
05:37 - one is going to be
05:38 - um pretty much go ahead and it's going
05:40 - to be teaching right so a lot of us
05:42 - wouldn't think it right like we're going
05:43 - to be like oh no but how the hell can i
05:45 - teach
05:45 - and also guys this is an order of when
05:47 - you can start doing this so number one
05:49 - is the thing you can do right now
05:50 - and believe it or not some of you are
05:52 - like yeah but i just joined the course
05:53 - how the hell can i start teaching
05:55 - right so teaching or mentoring or
05:57 - whatever it is or coaching
05:58 - anything like that is where i put this
06:00 - in now
06:02 - think of it this way right so let's just
06:03 - put like everyone's scale is going to be
06:05 - different
06:06 - okay so like imagine this is your
06:07 - timeline right and then this is like
06:09 - let's just say three months
06:11 - so at the end of this timeline is going
06:12 - to be three months and oops okay let's
06:14 - just
06:15 - let's just pretend that was smaller so
06:16 - we've got three months at the end of the
06:17 - timeline now
06:19 - what i want to say to you guys is let's
06:20 - say you're you're at the very early just
06:22 - joined profit with javascript you're
06:24 - here
06:24 - right now you're a weekend so this is
06:27 - actually just go ahead and say that this
06:29 - is like a one week into the course
06:31 - okay now you are already a week
06:34 - ahead of somebody that just joined right
06:37 - so let's just say somebody joined at
06:38 - this point
06:39 - yeah now you're already at this point
06:41 - right so you can offer a week's worth of
06:43 - value now
06:44 - what does that mean like if we sort of
06:46 - think about it in the sense of like
06:48 - um what that could mean that can mean
06:50 - loads of things right we could mean like
06:53 - you might be asking yourself what can i
06:54 - teach them right so you could be
06:55 - teaching them things like
06:56 - html you could be teaching them things
06:58 - like css like the very
07:00 - basics of web development now this is
07:02 - going to help you with a few things
07:03 - right
07:04 - let's say you didn't even teach them
07:05 - javascript let's just say you were you
07:06 - were sort of
07:07 - you're on the early modules you're
07:09 - messing around with html css
07:11 - right now what i would say is i highly
07:13 - recommend
07:14 - and when i say teaching i mean do it for
07:17 - free
07:18 - right now you're probably wondering yeah
07:19 - but what this kind of goes against how
07:21 - to make money
07:21 - no guys honestly this community has over
07:24 - 2 000 people inside of it
07:26 - honestly go ahead right inside that
07:28 - slack channel
07:29 - and say does anyone need help or like if
07:31 - you see somebody asking a question
07:32 - go ahead and jump in and the reason why
07:35 - is because
07:36 - your skill is going to literally i can't
07:39 - i can't stress this enough right like
07:42 - your skill in development goes through
07:44 - the
07:45 - roof when you start teaching it right
07:47 - like let's go ahead and say that i know
07:48 - how to piece together a web page with
07:50 - html and css
07:51 - now if i can do that using html like if
07:54 - i can do that by myself okay
07:55 - that's pretty good right but if i can go
07:58 - ahead and teach somebody who's an
07:59 - absolute beginner how what is html what
08:02 - is css how do i interlink
08:04 - in a web page and then how do i make
08:05 - that webpage look somewhat decent
08:07 - now i can immediately say that i
08:10 - actually
08:10 - know these two things pretty well right
08:12 - so if you're one weekend
08:14 - set yourself a goal and now what happens
08:16 - is you like you'll take this on
08:18 - on the side reality is that most of us
08:20 - there will probably be like an eighty
08:21 - percent
08:22 - about about eighty percent of us which
08:24 - won't act on this right there's usually
08:26 - just 20
08:27 - people who will really take this
08:28 - seriously and be like okay i'm actually
08:29 - a week into this
08:31 - so i'm going to actually take action i'm
08:32 - going to go ahead and i'm going to
08:33 - message inside that sac group
08:34 - i'm going to ask if anybody needs help
08:36 - right or if
08:37 - or literally just keep an eye on it if
08:39 - somebody's got a bug you go ahead and
08:41 - jump on it because
08:42 - if they run into a bug and you help them
08:44 - fix it that's going to help you when you
08:46 - run into that bug or even if you don't
08:47 - understand what is that exposure
08:49 - to more problems exposure to more coding
08:52 - everything helps your development
08:54 - okay so if you're one weekend you can
08:56 - help somebody and at this point i would
08:58 - say honestly
08:58 - i wouldn't even charge it the one month
09:00 - mark i wouldn't even say to somebody
09:02 - like uh
09:02 - like what's it called go ahead and give
09:04 - me some money for this stuff like
09:06 - even at the two month mark i wouldn't
09:08 - even bother i'll just literally the main
09:09 - focus here
09:10 - is to get better at coding right then
09:13 - obviously here you can go ahead and
09:14 - introduce
09:16 - javascript as well so you can have html
09:18 - css and javascript
09:20 - inside of your key you're teaching right
09:22 - then what this is going to do in the
09:24 - sort of like and it all depends on how
09:26 - remember this timeline is going to be
09:27 - unique to you so
09:29 - if you're putting in let's just say like
09:31 - 10 hours a week right
09:33 - then you're going to sort of dabble
09:34 - along and you'll maybe get there
09:36 - but in one month you might be here right
09:38 - but let's go ahead and say like patch
09:40 - is like right i want to completely kill
09:42 - this apache one of the students of
09:43 - course let's say
09:44 - he says like i'm going to absolutely
09:45 - dominate this thing i'm going to give
09:47 - like my all
09:48 - 40 hours a week i'm gonna like not stop
09:50 - till i get
09:51 - now here's one month as opposed to sort
09:53 - of reaching the same point here
09:55 - he's going to basically go ahead and
09:56 - keep going and then he's going to reach
09:58 - like maybe this point
10:00 - right so like you see like and and this
10:02 - effect
10:03 - gets bigger the more you do it okay like
10:05 - this effect gets bigger with the more
10:07 - you teach this
10:07 - effect gets bigger with the more you
10:09 - because as much as we want to kind of
10:11 - learn how to code
10:13 - you need to learn how to learn first and
10:15 - i know it sounds a bit silly but you
10:16 - really have to kind of
10:18 - figure out your best way of learning now
10:20 - the reason why i stress this so much
10:22 - is because the reason why like i can
10:24 - literally look at a web page now and
10:25 - clone the thing
10:26 - is because i was able to teach somebody
10:29 - css up until a point where i just knew
10:31 - flexbox inside out
10:33 - right if i wasn't teaching css i would i
10:35 - would kind of be like um i think i would
10:38 - do that i'm not sure
10:39 - maybe i do it this way maybe i do it
10:42 - that way
10:42 - and it kind of gets to a point where
10:44 - you're just not really you kind of reach
10:46 - a diminishing return and you're not
10:47 - really
10:48 - gaining a lot back from your time and
10:49 - then we end up getting stuck in
10:50 - something that we all know which is
10:52 - called tutorial hell
10:53 - right and then you're gonna basically
10:54 - reach the three-month mark and be like
10:56 - okay
10:56 - i was doing really good at this point so
10:59 - like everything was kind of going well
11:00 - up until the first month
11:02 - and then at this point everything just
11:03 - kind of seemed to slow down right so
11:04 - your progression was like this it was
11:06 - like
11:06 - you shot up you're doing really really
11:08 - well and then like slowly slowly slowly
11:11 - slowly slowly slowly slowly
11:13 - your motivation just starts to die and
11:15 - then after three months you're like you
11:16 - know what i don't think i'm actually cut
11:18 - out for coding
11:19 - and i can guarantee a lot of us are
11:20 - going to have this conversation with
11:22 - ourselves and we're going to kind of be
11:22 - a bit confused and
11:24 - and the way that you keep this curve up
11:26 - right and you start going
11:28 - up and up and up and up and up and up
11:29 - and up and up is for a few things here
11:31 - right
11:32 - one is attend the coaching course so the
11:34 - coaching calls are going to be massive
11:36 - for um keeping that motivation high
11:39 - right and also
11:40 - by being in a coaching call you're going
11:42 - to basically mirror
11:44 - how your how you can teach a student
11:46 - okay so bringing the coaching call
11:47 - you're going to see like okay i saw
11:49 - sonny do that
11:50 - and also if you're wondering this is
11:51 - called screen brush very very good for
11:52 - sort of drawing on the screen
11:54 - but what by being here you'll be able to
11:56 - mirror my behavior and sort of like go
11:57 - ahead and teach student
11:59 - now what makes you sort of eligible
12:01 - what's the criteria to go ahead and
12:02 - start teaching honestly nothing
12:04 - honestly nothing at all so we actually
12:05 - have a 13 year old in the
12:07 - in the course right now his name is
12:08 - preet and he he's somebody who's already
12:11 - started to sort of discuss clients and
12:12 - things like that
12:13 - now he's actually in the call right now
12:15 - and the one thing i'll say
12:17 - is you don't need to be there's no age
12:19 - limit there's no skill limit there's no
12:21 - nothing
12:22 - if you can provide value to someone else
12:24 - go ahead and invite them into a call and
12:26 - start teaching them that is literally as
12:27 - simple as it needs to be
12:29 - okay so that's all you need to do to go
12:31 - ahead and get started with this stuff
12:33 - now number one is teaching mentoring for
12:35 - coaching and stuff like that now
12:36 - obviously with this said
12:37 - most people actually come in at this
12:39 - point and they say you know what i'm
12:40 - going to go ahead and charge something
12:41 - crazy i want to make like 50 bucks an
12:42 - hour
12:43 - right and then you and then they're
12:45 - confused they're like sonny this
12:46 - doesn't work man like
12:48 - you know nobody wants to like pay me 50
12:50 - 000 because like of course nobody
12:52 - wants to pay you 50 an hour like you're
12:53 - just coming in and saying i'm going to
12:54 - teach you html css
12:56 - right like nobody's going to come at you
12:58 - and say like oh no you know
12:59 - and plus you're coming across like a
13:01 - salesman like and we all know that we
13:02 - hate salesmen like if you go to
13:04 - a car showroom you're like okay shut up
13:06 - i just want to look at the car i don't
13:07 - want you to tell me like what
13:09 - every single feature it has and all this
13:10 - sort of stuff right like
13:12 - instead focus on value okay like if you
13:15 - just focus on pure
13:17 - value now the reason why i stress this
13:19 - is because the minute you switch your
13:21 - mindset from this money sort of mindset
13:23 - money is a lagging indicator of success
13:25 - right like this thing is not going to
13:27 - tell you
13:28 - this is not your worth right this means
13:30 - nothing right this
13:31 - whether it's 100 whether it's 200
13:32 - whether it's whatever you charge
13:34 - whether it's five dollars or one dollar
13:37 - an hour like
13:37 - this means absolutely nothing okay what
13:40 - means
13:41 - everything is the value now the value is
13:44 - also going to translate when it comes to
13:45 - the permanent job
13:46 - because oops because what happens is
13:48 - oops okay there we go
13:50 - because what happens is if the minute
13:52 - you start thinking with a value mindset
13:55 - like and what i mean by value is can you
13:56 - provide value to a client can you
13:58 - provide value to another student can you
14:00 - provide value to somebody else
14:02 - right and that means like for example me
14:04 - on youtube teaching for free
14:05 - that's providing value right now well
14:08 - the reason why that's so powerful is
14:10 - because one
14:11 - by providing value to someone else like
14:12 - in the form of let's just say teaching
14:14 - or something like that
14:15 - you're going to like exponentially
14:18 - increase your sort of development speed
14:20 - you're going to get so much better at
14:21 - developing
14:22 - also it changes your like your soft
14:24 - skill approach to a conversation then
14:26 - becomes about
14:27 - how you can provide value to someone now
14:29 - let's let's like take two scenarios in
14:31 - into in into consideration right let's
14:33 - say you go in for a permanent job
14:34 - interview
14:35 - and let's say you go in right now and
14:36 - then let's say jack is interviewing you
14:38 - right so jack is interviewing you and
14:40 - then he comes across and says okay
14:42 - tell me what you can do for me right and
14:45 - then you go ahead and say
14:46 - um basically like i'm a boss developer
14:49 - all right
14:49 - and then you're like some super arrogant
14:51 - developer and you list out a long resume
14:54 - all right now at this point like jack's
14:56 - gonna be like okay this is like an
14:58 - arrogant developer i don't want to work
14:59 - with him um i
15:01 - to be honest like i if the position i
15:03 - did let's just find someone else like
15:04 - i'm telling you like this is how the
15:05 - conversation goes a lot of the time
15:07 - right now but now if you switch this and
15:10 - you kind of come in with a different
15:11 - mindset
15:12 - even if you're an absolute expert and
15:14 - you speak to jack and you say like hey
15:16 - jack
15:17 - i saw that you actually need a react
15:19 - developer and you're looking for
15:20 - somebody with redux
15:21 - but i also know about firebase i also
15:24 - know about this i also know
15:26 - about something else like i feel like
15:28 - this could benefit your company this
15:30 - could benefit your brand i feel like it
15:32 - could make your login flow a bit simpler
15:34 - if you did this and that
15:35 - now you're not talking about like money
15:37 - you're not trying to say that like you
15:38 - should hire me
15:39 - now you're trying to say like you're
15:41 - trying to add value to their company
15:42 - trying to add value to their team
15:44 - right and then what happens is the
15:47 - conversation about money then kind of
15:48 - becomes like more of a
15:49 - a very simple negotiation because you
15:51 - already won you already won over
15:53 - the client right and you need to think
15:54 - in that mindset and then this also
15:56 - this pans out with a lot of things this
15:58 - pans out with teaching like if you can
16:00 - come across and say to a student that
16:02 - you can actually provide them value and
16:03 - you can actually transform their entire
16:04 - bloody life by teaching them in your way
16:07 - then truth is is that you won't have a
16:09 - problem landing clients i'm telling you
16:10 - you won't have a problem landing
16:12 - two students to teach and your progress
16:14 - with those students is going to be
16:15 - incrementally better
16:16 - right but if you start focusing on like
16:18 - hey like i'm just i'm the best teacher
16:20 - out there and this and that
16:21 - then i'm telling you you're gonna just
16:23 - this line is gonna be a lot
16:25 - steeper of a decline so that is what i
16:27 - would say in that sense focus on value
16:29 - okay
16:30 - now let's go ahead and get rid of that
16:31 - number two is freelancing now
16:34 - um we've got uh two people oh sayuri
16:37 - wanted to ask okay
16:38 - and before that we gotta say mihawban is
16:40 - inside the zoom call
16:41 - hey where is she my girlfriend's in the
16:44 - chat

17:01 - while

17:05 - of code challenge
17:06 - okay i have been posting consistently on
17:09 - my
17:09 - instagram yeah and almost over 20 post
17:13 - yep and like me and sorak together have
17:16 - started
17:17 - uh coaching coaching students for free
17:20 - like we are planning to have a session
17:22 - like a group session of people and
17:24 - we will coach them okay html
17:27 - javascript also build a game by end of
17:31 - by end of this month with them yeah and
17:33 - stuff will be
17:34 - walking them over through dsa and all
17:37 - those stuff
17:38 - yeah what i wanted to know is like uh
17:42 - in my previous call i asked you about
17:44 - coaching people
17:46 - yeah and you on rachel and almost
17:48 - everyone advised me
17:50 - to start posting content on instagram
17:54 - okay and um yeah i'm doing that for
17:56 - quite a while
17:57 - yeah and like uh so my question now is
18:01 - that uh okay
18:02 - i i started posting content now how do i
18:05 - land paid coaching plans i'm already
18:08 - doing it for free
18:09 - yep now how will you find paid okay so
18:12 - let me tell you on this sonny uh i've
18:15 - seen this a lot
18:16 - like people reach out to you like when
18:18 - you start posting content and you
18:20 - start providing value a lot of shitty
18:23 - people reach out to you
18:24 - the most yeah 199
18:27 - are going to be spam and 99 people are
18:30 - gonna be
18:31 - the guys who are actually not gonna pay
18:34 - for you
18:34 - for the value you're gonna provide yes
18:36 - but the thing is you gotta keep going
18:39 - and finally one day you're gonna land
18:40 - someone you know like
18:42 - i've been i've been doing this for
18:44 - around four months and i've
18:46 - like replied to hundreds of people like
18:50 - and almost 99 percent don't take my
18:53 - advice
18:54 - first thing like on instagram like
18:56 - people ask can you share resources yeah
18:58 - i'll share you
18:58 - and i share a lot of resources and what
19:01 - happens is they never do that
19:02 - because we are providing it for free and
19:05 - they don't value things when you give it
19:07 - for free you know
19:08 - so that's one thing and then
19:12 - from this week as i said i i started uh
19:15 - i'm starting to
19:15 - uh coach on a big platform and that's
19:19 - because people value my value what i'm
19:22 - providing that's why people like
19:24 - genuine people reach out so you gotta
19:26 - face these shitty people but you just
19:28 - gotta keep going
19:29 - it's not gonna change over within if you
19:32 - start
19:32 - posting content for one month it's not
19:34 - gonna change
19:35 - you receive more the number of spammers
19:38 - are going to increase and not the real
19:40 - uh real people who's going to pay for
19:42 - you you got to keep going for at least
19:44 - three months when you start landing
19:47 - actual paying clients you know exactly
19:51 - if you don't believe me if you don't
19:52 - believe me i landed a client
19:54 - just from instagram i never did anything
19:56 - he reached out to me and he asked
19:58 - can you teach me html css and all this
20:00 - stuff so that's where it starts the
20:02 - conversation started about three months
20:04 - back
20:05 - and then i was like helping out him on
20:07 - you know it was completely for free
20:09 - i never asked for money or anything it
20:11 - was completely for free i was just
20:13 - providing value that's all
20:14 - so last month he came up with a project
20:17 - that his friend needs in canada and in
20:20 - eight hours i earned 250 dollars
20:22 - in just eight dollars yeah exactly
20:26 - can you when you keep
20:29 - uh when you keep uh um what do you say
20:32 - when you keep providing value you will
20:33 - eventually
20:34 - land people who's gonna pay for you
20:36 - exactly yeah so that's what i would
20:38 - that's what
20:39 - what i would recommend is one amanat is
20:40 - a key person who honestly i'm not taught
20:42 - me a lot about social media presence
20:44 - right
20:45 - so uh amanat actually works with me
20:47 - intensively when it comes to social
20:48 - media and i don't know i don't know if
20:49 - you guys have seen the growth has been
20:50 - pretty insane
20:51 - so like uh you can thank amanda for that
20:53 - as well um and what i would say is
20:55 - focus on providing value okay so uh so i
20:58 - already use
20:58 - you mentioned that you you're you've
20:59 - been posting some instagram content how
21:02 - long firstly so my first question is how
21:03 - long have you been posting instagram
21:04 - content
21:06 - um right 30 days right now honestly
21:10 - the way you need to think of it is do
21:12 - not expect a return in
21:14 - 13 30 days or like 60 days or 90 days
21:17 - literally instead just focus on like
21:20 - an unprecedented amount of value okay
21:23 - like don't even think about the client
21:25 - don't even think about like
21:26 - how can i make money from this just
21:28 - focus on how can i honestly keep on
21:30 - dropping more
21:31 - value like which is why me and kazzy
21:33 - when we first started doing the live
21:34 - streams me and
21:35 - him had a conversation we were like
21:36 - let's try and do something more right
21:37 - let's try and add some more value to
21:39 - like to everyone who wants to become a
21:40 - developer so we started doing live
21:42 - streaming
21:42 - and then we actually found very quickly
21:45 - we
21:45 - we we were like let's just try and push
21:48 - ourselves and do a one stream a week
21:50 - or maybe one stream like a month and
21:51 - we'll make it really good and we'll do
21:52 - that
21:53 - and the next thing you know we're doing
21:54 - daily live streams and we're building
21:55 - like crazy apps and all sorts of stuff
21:57 - right and that's all because we just
21:58 - want to push
21:59 - the amount of value that we can provide
22:02 - now trust me when i say when you do that
22:04 - you don't have you you don't have a
22:05 - problem landing uh like
22:07 - like a client or freelance position
22:09 - literally the amount of emails that you
22:10 - get in that say like hey you're just
22:12 - wondering if you can work with me for
22:13 - some react stuff
22:14 - because they see that as a value they
22:16 - see that as an opportunity to work with
22:17 - you
22:18 - that is the main focus okay now i would
22:20 - say
22:21 - try to sway away from that mindset of
22:24 - kind of like how can i make money from
22:26 - this straight away right like
22:27 - like it's a very you need a fine balance
22:30 - okay like is in because you need to
22:31 - focus more on
22:32 - how you can actually go ahead and
22:34 - provide value and then that's the honest
22:36 - truth to that answer
22:37 - okay um i'm not you said there was two
22:40 - people
22:42 - yeah and lem would you like to provide
22:44 - us some
22:45 - value because he was we joined profit
22:48 - javascript just about two
22:50 - one month ago and he has made around 1
22:53 - hundred dollars just nice awesome dude
22:56 - so lamb let's go yeah where are you okay
22:59 - that's that's awesome stuff let me go
23:00 - ahead and uh

23:03 - here guys if you can see him yeah
23:06 - nice go ahead lem what's your take on
23:10 - this uh in terms of and how were you
23:11 - able to go ahead and land
23:13 - like make some money from from coaching
23:16 - i think you might be muted dude
23:18 - um i think he's having some bad
23:21 - connection or maybe
23:22 - might be yeah it might be a technical
23:24 - issue okay so lem
23:25 - as soon as it goes ahead and comes back
23:27 - feel free to literally drop a message
23:29 - and
23:29 - uh and we're happy to lam's awesome man
23:32 - like he actually went ahead and made
23:34 - i mean like the course is is uh the
23:36 - current time i think you got it was
23:37 - maybe uh 697 or 597 now afterwards
23:40 - he was able to actually go ahead and
23:41 - make like three times a return on that
23:43 - right like which is insane
23:45 - and like it's no joke when i tell you
23:47 - guys that like
23:48 - it's not it's not surprising to me now
23:50 - like honestly when i say that like i'm
23:52 - used to students coming back to me and
23:53 - saying like
23:54 - hey sunny like i got this job
23:55 - opportunity what should i do should i
23:57 - take it should i decide and then i end
23:58 - up having a conversation with them
23:59 - we just kind of go back and forth and
24:00 - it's like i'll sometimes say like
24:03 - they're under pricing you maybe pitch
24:04 - higher or sometimes say like you know
24:06 - you can maybe push a bit like push less
24:08 - don't really just focus on getting the
24:09 - value and experience
24:10 - so like those kind of conversations come
24:12 - naturally with this sort of stuff but
24:14 - just focus on the value that's my main
24:16 - advice guys
24:17 - i just want to jump back into this topic
24:20 - right now so
24:21 - you guys can see so we talked about the
24:23 - teaching side of things right and how
24:24 - you can make money from that
24:25 - the next one was freelancing now
24:27 - freelancing is kind of a word that
24:29 - we we throw it around and the truth is
24:32 - even i was like yeah i want to become a
24:34 - freelancer um but the truth is i mean
24:35 - like until i actually started landing
24:38 - clients i had no idea how to land
24:40 - clients with freelancing i had no idea
24:42 - honey frank just said he just did a
24:45 - linkedin
24:46 - resume review and interview prep for 500
24:49 - this week damn bro where's frank okay

25:24 - someone
25:24 - he's in new york and he's prepping for
25:27 - uh
25:28 - um an ios developer position in new york
25:31 - city
25:32 - yeah and and i did a resume review prep
25:35 - and i'm i'm an ios developer primarily
25:38 - and i actually went and talked to the
25:40 - guy
25:40 - and i helped him prep for his interview
25:42 - and he was like oh thanks so much
25:44 - three hours of work 500 bucks nice dude
25:48 - that's insane i've ever would have
25:50 - thought about i never would have thought
25:51 - about that like i've interviewed
25:53 - literally hundreds of people in los
25:54 - angeles yeah every mobile developer in
25:56 - los angeles knows me
25:58 - so it's like i i did that for free
26:00 - basically
26:01 - dude that's insane man like that's a
26:03 - real thing on linkedin now i had no idea
26:05 - so you did a resume review and that
26:08 - involved three hours of work and you got
26:10 - in return five hundred dollars right
26:12 - yeah and i and i asked and i did a um
26:14 - interview prep
26:15 - also i did a live interview for the for
26:18 - the person
26:18 - right so you know the nation the the
26:21 - typical questions and all that stuff and
26:23 - he was like man that's i feel
26:24 - super ready now
26:28 - now quick question how did you actually
26:30 - find him like how did you find that
26:32 - that guy on linkedin actually um i
26:35 - i'm a part of a bunch of linkedin groups
26:38 - okay actually this is a really cool
26:39 - thing that you can post to these
26:40 - linkedin groups and say hey guys i'll
26:42 - i'll offer this
26:43 - okay and a cup and he was the first
26:45 - person that that
26:46 - um was biting and i said hey i can help
26:49 - you
26:50 - and and there it is and this was just
26:52 - off of
26:53 - offhanded remark from one of your live
26:55 - streams that you and qazi were talking
26:57 - about it
26:58 - yeah and i was like i didn't know you
26:59 - could do that i didn't know you could do
27:00 - that
27:01 - dude that's insane man yeah because i
27:03 - think we i remember
27:04 - like a similar conversation around this
27:06 - stuff like and uh
27:08 - dude that's that's so sick man like
27:09 - that's really really i didn't even know
27:11 - that resume reviewing was a thing like
27:13 - to be honest so that yeah yeah that's
27:15 - really really awesome and i think guys
27:16 - that's a perfect example of like
27:18 - sometimes think outside the box because
27:20 - the trends are always moving right in
27:22 - tech like
27:23 - that like i mean who would have thought
27:24 - resume review would have made 500 like
27:26 - it's like you know i mean like and that
27:28 - took frank three hours like
27:29 - i mean like an interview prep and what
27:31 - he did is he actually used his own skill
27:33 - that he had acquired
27:34 - through working companies working and he
27:35 - reinvested that back in
27:37 - and he basically was able to pull some
27:38 - money out in the form of a resume
27:40 - interview
27:40 - so it's never a case of like uh if you
27:44 - do
27:45 - like one action it's going to come back
27:47 - with a monetary value like is it if we
27:49 - post uh if we make like so much like
27:51 - instagram content and things like that
27:53 - it's going to come back in that form
27:55 - sometimes it's insane like sometimes
27:57 - okay you might be posting more into
27:58 - instagram content that's going to make
27:59 - you kind of like
28:01 - become more known in the space which
28:03 - means your network kind of grows
28:04 - naturally with that and then you end up
28:07 - getting like right now my linkedin
28:08 - requests are going insane
28:09 - because everyone sees me on youtube they
28:11 - see dropping value and then before you
28:13 - know it you get people sending you
28:14 - messages saying hey
28:15 - i actually i'm building this kind of
28:17 - website i need some help or something
28:19 - naturally it will come your way and also
28:21 - like like frank said
28:23 - keep an eye on the trends like is in
28:25 - like he heard from a simple conversation
28:26 - with me and qazi
28:27 - that there's something called resume
28:29 - reviewing he took action went ahead and
28:30 - checked out
28:31 - and before you know it three hours later
28:33 - the guy like frank's made five hundred
28:34 - dollars like and frank
28:36 - you're like a dude you drop so much
28:38 - value on these sessions it's insane like
28:40 - yeah and this this is actually something
28:42 - really cool i think i think we should
28:44 - um have a like a react
28:47 - developer linkedin group and all of us
28:49 - join it let's do it and then
28:51 - we might get job postings we might get
28:53 - different stuff linkedin is very
28:54 - powerful
28:55 - dude let's do it in fact frank i tell
28:57 - you what take the lead on it
28:58 - take literally take lead on it and um
29:00 - yeah and send me a message afterwards
29:02 - and
29:02 - guys if that sounds good to you just
29:04 - raise your hand and we can pretty much
29:05 - go and do it
29:06 - garyvee says linkedin is like facebook
29:09 - in 2010.
29:10 - yeah exactly exactly and ian just said
29:14 - one really interesting thing yep your
29:16 - network
29:17 - is your net worth yeah yeah yep
29:21 - yep exactly yeah dude that's i love that
29:23 - i love that your network is your net
29:25 - worth
29:25 - and you know what that's literally
29:26 - naturally what i was going to come on to
29:28 - when it came to
29:29 - the freelancing stuff you would think
29:31 - right that you would get most of your
29:32 - freelancing gigs from these online
29:34 - companies and stuff like that
29:35 - truth is almost like i think maybe 70
29:38 - of my jobs came from my network right
29:41 - like it was literally word of mouth and
29:42 - like and
29:43 - and it could have been like in the
29:44 - beginning sure this is going to be a
29:45 - slow route of growth
29:47 - but if you build that network and and
29:48 - the ways to build the network that you
29:50 - can do it in so many ways you can attend
29:51 - conferences
29:52 - yeah and and also i'd actually really
29:54 - really push you to do that and i know
29:56 - that
29:56 - right now we're in corona virus
29:58 - situation so you can't do that as such
29:59 - but
30:00 - there are digital sort of summits there
30:02 - are digital events you can go ahead and
30:04 - join it facebook groups things like that
30:06 - linkedin linkedin is always going crazy
30:08 - and you just writing a comment back can
30:10 - get you someone talking to you right
30:12 - so that can go ahead and build your
30:13 - network and literally what i did is okay
30:14 - so this is kind of a
30:15 - uh like i don't know if it's a cheap
30:17 - trick but to build my network what i did
30:19 - is i literally would type in like
30:21 - sunny and i would go ahead and i would
30:23 - connect with all the sunnies right and i
30:25 - would literally type in like
30:26 - david and i'd connect with david and
30:28 - before you knew it i kind of
30:29 - had a head start i was like okay this
30:31 - actually worked pretty decent like i
30:33 - know it's not going to be the right
30:34 - the right idea of networking but i mean
30:37 - that kind of hacky way actually got my
30:39 - connections up and before you know it
30:41 - the algorithm the linkedin algorithm
30:42 - pretty much started matching me with
30:44 - developers started matching me with like
30:45 - uh designers and stuff like that and and
30:47 - then next you know it kind of just
30:49 - shaped around that
30:50 - but uh now a lot of sort of freelancing
30:52 - opportunities
30:53 - fly in through linkedin so definitely
30:56 - don't underestimate your networks
30:57 - um i'm gonna ask any questions before we
31:00 - move on to freelancing
31:01 - uh we got nasir
31:09 - [Music]
31:11 - how's it going dude so
31:14 - uh you remember so the client i am
31:18 - working
31:19 - with is many people don't know but i am
31:22 - actually a
31:23 - back-end i have worked more in back-end
31:26 - than
31:27 - front-end so the client asked me to
31:30 - make him the front end also so he
31:32 - doesn't want to hire another developer
31:34 - because he thinks that his idea is
31:36 - suspicious so
31:37 - and another person will copy it okay so
31:39 - he wants me to build a front end so i
31:41 - have built him the
31:42 - full back end with django with django
31:45 - raspberry
31:46 - so basically it's an api yep so the
31:49 - question i am going to ask if knife made
31:51 - me sound like
31:52 - upgraded with city but i know i have i
31:55 - should
31:56 - build a lot the all of those clones that
31:59 - you have made
32:00 - on youtube but i only have two weeks
32:02 - after two weeks i have to get started
32:03 - okay which one is most heavily based on
32:07 - apis
32:08 - the back end okay so i can learn
32:12 - not in destiny right what which uh which
32:14 - language are you calling the backend
32:15 - in django
32:18 - okay so django uh if in terms of django
32:22 - i would recommend looking at kazi's
32:23 - videos that he published before
32:25 - so this was quite a while back because
32:27 - kazi focused a lot more on django
32:28 - development but
32:29 - if you could use something like node.js
32:32 - i'd recommend the netflix clone
32:34 - and things like that because we talked
32:35 - about a lot about like subaxios and
32:36 - stuff like that even
32:38 - um the man stack builds are very good
32:40 - for getting exposure to a back-end
32:42 - development
32:42 - even understanding it literally at this
32:45 - point it wouldn't even matter
32:46 - too much about like the language you
32:47 - kind of get used to how front-end
32:50 - communicates with back-end and how that
32:51 - communication goes back and forth
32:53 - really nail that in through and put
32:54 - through the clones and through
32:55 - practicing
32:56 - and that's going to allow you to go
32:58 - ahead and actually really like at this
33:00 - point if you asked me to code something
33:01 - and the price was good enough and you
33:02 - said like hey sonny
33:04 - go ahead and do it in python i haven't
33:05 - coded in python in a while but because i
33:07 - know how front end works and how
33:09 - in works i you can kind of hack it
33:10 - together you know and you can get that
33:11 - thing running
33:12 - like so my advice to you would be to
33:14 - practice the clones especially the man
33:16 - stack builds
33:17 - and the netflix one is a good one um to
33:19 - go ahead and practice it with
33:20 - um but in terms of the actual language
33:22 - because right now we're sort of focused
33:23 - on react
33:24 - and sort of the javascript stacks um i
33:26 - would say if you're looking at django
33:28 - maybe look at kazi's stuff from before
33:30 - or profit with python uh is actually a
33:31 - really good thing where we we teach a
33:33 - lot of that stuff
33:34 - also just right yeah yeah exactly nice
33:37 - dude
33:38 - and i just want to say nazir how old do
33:40 - you know
33:43 - how are you yeah yeah okay so i'm
33:47 - 14. right you're 14 right and guys i
33:49 - just want to shout nazir out right now
33:51 - nazir how much money have you made right
33:53 - now from coding
33:55 - roughly
33:58 - three games 3k guys 3k like
34:02 - goddamn like can we just give it up for
34:03 - nazi like because in like that is
34:05 - awesome man like
34:06 - 3k like that's an inspiration like right
34:08 - there like the fact that he and he says
34:10 - it's so chill i love it
34:11 - he's so chill about it every time he's
34:13 - like you know i just made 3k
34:15 - you know it's just nothing it's side
34:17 - cash
34:18 - but there's honestly awesome work and i
34:20 - hope that somewhat helps you out with
34:22 - that
34:22 - um let's jump back into another question
34:25 - yeah
34:25 - okay uh let's let's take um if you don't
34:29 - mind go ahead and send a message to
34:31 - amanat
34:32 - in in the private chat and what i'm
34:33 - doing is i'm going to just go ahead and
34:34 - send it on our slack chat and we can
34:36 - kind of
34:36 - uh rank up the popular questions that
34:38 - would be a good idea yeah yeah that'd be
34:40 - a good idea yeah
34:41 - i'll do that and that way we can kind of
34:42 - get a balance between the two yeah
34:44 - right guys so freelancing we were
34:47 - talking about so we have a network right
34:48 - so you can pretty much grow your network
34:50 - that's going to be honestly my advice
34:51 - would be
34:52 - do not underestimate i used to never
34:53 - think that money would come from my
34:55 - network but
34:56 - you'd be surprised like it's always word
34:58 - of mouth lately like i said i would get
35:00 - a text message from some random person
35:01 - and be like oh hey
35:02 - um so-and-so said that you code and and
35:05 - you know and even friends and family
35:07 - you'll be surprised
35:08 - like don't free up don't be afraid to
35:10 - tell people that you code and don't be
35:11 - afraid to like even if you're a beginner
35:12 - just say like yeah i code websites
35:15 - that's enough to sort of get your name a
35:16 - bit out then you'd be surprised like a
35:18 - friend of a friend
35:19 - who needs a website bill would come back
35:21 - to you and then you actually
35:23 - land that person so build the network
35:25 - early and the opportunities can kind of
35:27 - flourish
35:28 - as time goes on okay otherwise if you
35:30 - try and build it and you kind of like
35:31 - okay nothing's happening
35:33 - it's not it needs a bit of time to sort
35:35 - of like grow and prosper and things like
35:37 - that but
35:37 - this feeds back into value deliver value
35:39 - and your network will grow very easily
35:41 - the second one is there's loads of
35:42 - different website websites with this is
35:44 - upwork upwork is a very very good one
35:47 - to sort of look at you've also got for
35:50 - teaching guys
35:51 - there's another one that's called take
35:52 - lessons so take lessons if you haven't
35:55 - already maybe take an action note right
35:56 - now to go ahead and set up an account
35:58 - and take lessons
35:59 - and remember it doesn't matter if you're
36:00 - a weekend two months in uh three months
36:02 - in
36:03 - go ahead and do take lessons to go ahead
36:04 - and sign up to this because having a
36:06 - profile on here is going to be a good
36:07 - start
36:08 - so up work again i would recommend you
36:10 - as an action point to go ahead and set
36:12 - up a upward profile don't worry
36:14 - about not being good enough for like
36:15 - freelancing and stuff like that trust me
36:18 - don't worry it's just the exposure to
36:20 - these platforms is going to help you
36:22 - now what i've found is things like
36:24 - freelancer
36:25 - so there's a famous one called
36:26 - freelancer i think it's like freelance
36:28 - or freelancer.com
36:29 - this one i mean it's very popular but i
36:32 - find that
36:34 - it's based off a bidding right and the
36:36 - the problem that i find is that the
36:37 - quality of work that you get on here is
36:39 - usually
36:40 - less than up work up work the quality is
36:42 - pretty high i think the the
36:43 - freelancer.com
36:44 - job sometimes i in my experience i found
36:46 - the quality of jobs to be a bit lower
36:48 - or the clients kind of give me a bit
36:50 - more headache so it's just my personal
36:52 - opinion but
36:53 - don't get me wrong i've i've had some
36:55 - people tell me freelancer.com is amazing
36:57 - so
36:57 - you build up a profile on
36:58 - freelancers.com and you can actually
37:00 - crush it so
37:01 - uh don't don't take like me as saying
37:03 - this is ruled out this is not all ruled
37:05 - out but
37:05 - what you can do at this point is like
37:07 - say for the first month you can start
37:08 - teaching
37:09 - uh and then in month one to two i would
37:11 - actually say up the teaching that maybe
37:13 - don't jump on the freelancing route
37:14 - after from months two to three set
37:17 - yourself a target of saying okay i might
37:18 - actually try
37:20 - and dive into your freelancing gig right
37:23 - and then if you have like doubts or
37:24 - confusion
37:25 - literally take a screenshot of it send
37:27 - it to the community and say like hey
37:28 - guys
37:29 - here's what i know so far i know html
37:31 - css javascript i haven't really touched
37:33 - on react
37:33 - can i take a job on and then some people
37:35 - someone will come back to you even i
37:36 - will come back to you and say
37:37 - i think you should maybe touch on react
37:39 - at this point and maybe you can then go
37:41 - ahead and layer this up with react so
37:42 - react if you guys
37:44 - are unfamiliar or not sort of like known
37:46 - to it it's pretty much like a wrapper
37:47 - think of it like that it's a library
37:49 - that we use with that stack so html css
37:51 - javascript
37:52 - just wraps everything and then it
37:54 - basically supercharges your app and you
37:56 - can do some cool stuff with that
37:57 - um so yeah between months two and three
38:00 - you can kind of
38:01 - begin to touch on freelancing if you put
38:03 - in the work
38:04 - and i would say putting in the work is
38:05 - going to be the number one thing here
38:07 - that really is going to determine
38:09 - any of this success that comes with any
38:11 - of these three points
38:12 - then i would say the final one is
38:13 - permanent job okay so permanent job is
38:15 - something i actually kind of delay to
38:16 - the end
38:17 - because this one's going to provide you
38:19 - the most stability so you're going to
38:20 - have like stability with this so you're
38:22 - never going to sort of like it's not
38:23 - going to be up and down it's just going
38:24 - to be a sore stable income
38:26 - um freelancing however if you choose
38:29 - this is your full-time position
38:30 - freelancing can be like very very
38:33 - lucrative if you get very good at it and
38:35 - there was a time when i was freelancing
38:37 - where
38:38 - i was supplementing my income really
38:39 - nicely and
38:41 - but remember this is one thing that they
38:43 - don't tell you
38:44 - with a permanent job you have one boss
38:46 - right you have just like
38:47 - let's just say fred is your boss right
38:49 - or sarah is your boss
38:50 - right sarah is the boss right she's
38:53 - she's in charge of everything
38:54 - but with freelancing you have like six
38:56 - bosses
38:57 - right so let's say you take on six
38:58 - freelancing gigs now you've got six
39:00 - bosses so like
39:01 - if you think of it in that sense yes
39:04 - there is more money but now you have to
39:05 - report to six people
39:06 - as opposed to just sarah okay so like
39:10 - that's something which you don't often
39:11 - think about when you think about
39:12 - freelancing yeah there's a lot more
39:14 - money and you can work from wherever you
39:15 - want and
39:15 - even the permanent jobs to be honest the
39:18 - sort of benefit of it
39:19 - is that a lot more jobs are remote now
39:21 - which means that
39:22 - um looking at the bright side of things
39:24 - you can actually go ahead and get a
39:26 - remote permanent job so it's actually a
39:28 - really good time to go ahead and
39:30 - start applying for jobs and i would say
39:32 - actually if you put in 40 hours a week
39:33 - or something like that
39:35 - and you take three months very seriously
39:37 - i truly think at the end of three months
39:39 - you can actually go ahead and start
39:40 - applying for junior positions
39:42 - right like whether it's internship
39:44 - whether it's something else like you can
39:45 - go ahead and
39:46 - be sure that you can apply to permanent
39:48 - job positions
39:50 - and i would say even like pitch yourself
39:52 - a lower salary honestly because
39:54 - the the value you're going to get by
39:55 - just shadowing or being behind someone
39:58 - or being like literally just like
39:59 - working around other developers is going
40:01 - to be invaluable okay
40:02 - so with that said this is the three ways
40:05 - to make money with code
40:06 - i touch on this every time and we always
40:08 - go like deeper and deeper into this
40:10 - and i think what would be really cool
40:12 - and you guys can let me know is that
40:13 - like if we eventually sort of get into
40:15 - actually practically going through some
40:16 - stuff so that one day i'm actually gonna
40:18 - go ahead and set up take lessons online
40:20 - on a coaching course
40:21 - up like a network account show you guys
40:23 - how to do that
40:24 - and how you guys can go get aside but
40:26 - right now let's jump into a bit of
40:28 - technical stuff so
40:30 - um we so so everything kind of breaks
40:33 - down so web development
40:35 - let's go ahead and say web development
40:37 - oh god why is it on live streams i can
40:40 - my spelling is always crap development
40:42 - yeah there you go
40:43 - so um web development consists of if you
40:46 - just
40:46 - break it down to very core fundamentals
40:48 - right you have
40:49 - uh html right you have css
40:53 - and you have javascript okay now
40:57 - html is how a web page looks and feels
41:00 - okay so
41:00 - why haven't i got the square tool there
41:02 - we go it's a html it's pretty much the
41:04 - web page
41:04 - okay so you've got like different
41:06 - elements in the web page you might have
41:07 - a picture over here you might have some
41:09 - stuff over here you might have like a
41:11 - footer over here it's just pretty much
41:13 - getting on the page but
41:14 - html by itself is ugly okay
41:18 - so it's just it looks ugly you can't
41:20 - really do much i mean if you have a site
41:21 - like this nobody's
41:22 - gonna want to go on your site so you
41:24 - pair that with css now css is where
41:26 - everything comes to life it starts
41:28 - looking really pretty
41:29 - and this is why facebook looks like
41:31 - facebook this is why google looks like
41:32 - google so you have
41:33 - html and css and they work really nicely
41:36 - together to make you a
41:37 - really nice beautiful web page and now
41:40 - this is cool if a web page looks nice
41:42 - it's kind of cool but we want to do
41:44 - stuff with the web page and that's where
41:45 - javascript comes in so the way to think
41:47 - of javascript is um
41:49 - javascript is pretty much the brains
41:51 - okay so like just refer to javascript as
41:53 - the brains of the app
41:54 - without javascript you can't do any
41:56 - clever stuff you can't have like a click
41:57 - on a button you can't have uh
42:00 - logging in you can't really do anything
42:01 - without javascript right just with html
42:03 - css
42:04 - you don't have that like that
42:05 - functionality so
42:07 - these three things if you're new to the
42:09 - course and you are you're absolutely new
42:11 - to coding and development
42:12 - make sure you go ahead and you nail this
42:14 - stuff like is in just
42:15 - practice this stuff again and again but
42:17 - most people are kind of get stuck in a
42:19 - question of like when do i know when to
42:20 - progress
42:21 - to react right now my i just have a
42:24 - simple sort of test for this where
42:26 - what i would say is like on this side of
42:28 - things make sure you you dive into
42:30 - things like flexbox
42:31 - um css grid i would say is questionable
42:34 - if you know flexbox i would kind of like
42:36 - you don't need to know css grid
42:38 - um but flexbox is something which is
42:40 - definitely sort of i would consider it a
42:42 - fundamental
42:43 - and if you guys don't know already
42:44 - there's an amazing website called
42:46 - flexbox foggy
42:47 - uh which i always use to teach and
42:50 - actually
42:50 - somebody actually taught me about it at
42:52 - work um and i'll go ahead and show you
42:55 - guys that so
42:56 - oh my god what's going on um okay
42:59 - here we go um just wanna give a heads up
43:02 - to people who are total beginners
43:04 - is that tomorrow on wednesday at 11 a.m
43:07 - pst
43:08 - we have a back to basics coaching call
43:10 - where we'll be going through the
43:12 - total basics like talking about what's
43:14 - web development
43:15 - what is html css and all this stuff so
43:19 - make sure to join that
43:20 - and you'll get the maximum benefit so
43:22 - it's also going to be like a series like
43:24 - we'll be going through the
43:26 - basics and we'll be building simple
43:28 - projects like landing pages and
43:29 - and stuff for the next whole month every
43:32 - wednesday at 11 am pst
43:34 - yep exactly yeah so so make sure you go
43:36 - ahead and check that out that's tomorrow
43:37 - right i'm not
43:38 - yep exactly yes tomorrow so tomorrow a
43:41 - lot of you guys are going to be able to
43:42 - benefit from a
43:43 - coaching call with amanath and david
43:45 - right yep
43:46 - and that's that's pretty much going to
43:48 - cover everything that i said here so
43:49 - this is like the basics right you're not
43:51 - covering um react in that are you um no
43:54 - we won't be calling react we're just
43:55 - gonna be building a landing page on
43:58 - on the html css got it
44:01 - okay got you so in that case guys make
44:03 - sure you go to that because that's gonna
44:05 - be hugely valuable for you all
44:07 - and that's you're basically going to get
44:08 - a grasp of the fundamentals of web
44:10 - development right
44:11 - so it's like building a house right if
44:13 - you try and react is the really nice
44:15 - paint at the end of the
44:16 - uh at the end of the house right and
44:18 - it's like the the fancy garage that
44:20 - lifts up and down like when you drive
44:21 - close to it or something like that like
44:23 - reacts to cool stuff that you kind of
44:24 - add on to the house afterwards but
44:26 - if you don't have like html is like the
44:28 - foundation of the house right css is
44:30 - liquor paint on the house
44:31 - javascript is like the lights on the
44:33 - house right like you need the
44:34 - fundamentals of the house in order to
44:36 - even have a house in the first place
44:38 - right so react is something that kind of
44:39 - like the way i think of react is it's
44:41 - like
44:42 - you master this stuff first and then you
44:44 - basically have like a wrapper around
44:46 - around all of the the fundamentals and
44:48 - that's a library called react okay so
44:50 - reactors get made by the guys over at
44:51 - facebook
44:52 - um it is here to stay like trust me when
44:55 - i say that it's here to say
44:57 - um i'll show you some like if you're not
44:59 - sold on react already from the sort of
45:01 - clones and stuff like that then
45:02 - i'll show you some quick stats on that
45:04 - in a sec but react is pretty much is so
45:06 - powerful and it's constantly evolving i
45:08 - think they're on version 17 now
45:10 - and uh it's constantly getting better
45:12 - and better and better and we're also
45:13 - going to cover things like um
45:15 - in react you have things like class
45:17 - based verse functional and i always get
45:19 - this question
45:19 - like which one do i use how do i know
45:21 - which one to use and things like that
45:22 - we'll cover that today as well
45:24 - um but yeah so react is something which
45:26 - which is basically this is where
45:28 - this stuff is needed as a fundamental
45:30 - but react is really where you can start
45:32 - making some serious money from it
45:34 - okay so like react is the reason why
45:36 - like uh frank was pretty much pre
45:37 - like working that sonos gig and getting
45:40 - a six figure
45:41 - contract from that so that that was
45:42 - using react and he's not just using
45:44 - react react x so
45:45 - react also opens the door to something
45:48 - called react native so if you want to be
45:49 - a web developer
45:50 - you can actually go ahead and use your
45:52 - code base from react
45:53 - uh pretty much nearly all of it inside
45:56 - of react native
45:57 - with some subtle differences and we're
45:59 - actually going to be dropping some
46:00 - content on react native as well so if
46:01 - you guys have been waiting for that
46:03 - it will be coming we're trying to do so
46:06 - much for you guys right now um so we're
46:08 - just trying to balance everything
46:09 - uh yeah so this is like this is insanely
46:12 - valuable because from react you can
46:13 - build really powerful websites from
46:14 - react native you can have ios and
46:16 - android apps
46:17 - right so it's going to pretty much be
46:19 - revolutionary once you know this stuff
46:21 - now something to quickly shout out
46:23 - flexbox foggy okay so like there's 24
46:25 - levels
46:26 - honestly guys add this to your like
46:29 - notes if you're taking notes right now
46:31 - do this like i'm i promise you if you do
46:34 - the levels of flexbox froggy
46:36 - you will know like somewhat flexbox
46:38 - stuff like after you're done because
46:40 - i remember a guy at work was like sonny
46:42 - have you tried this game flex with a
46:43 -  about flexible programs i don't
46:44 - need a game to teach me how to like code
46:46 - like i can figure out like from you know
46:48 - like docs and stuff that's what the
46:49 - clever people do
46:50 - and then afterwards i was like you know
46:51 - what i kind of got stuck on the website
46:53 - and i was like you know what maybe i
46:54 - shouldn't like
46:55 - knock this let me go ahead and check it
46:56 - out i promise you i did levels one to 24
46:59 - and every time i get rusty with it i
47:00 - come back here
47:02 - and i make sure that like i i just do
47:04 - levels one to 24 and i kind of get
47:06 - better again
47:06 - and i'm like oh good now i saw bishesh
47:09 - says i finished level 23 and i'm stuck
47:10 - on 24.
47:12 - if you really get stuck i would say
47:14 - actually no don't google the answer for
47:15 - it
47:16 - just literally pop it in the in the
47:17 - slack chat and see who if someone else
47:19 - can do it that's kind of a good practice
47:21 - to see
47:21 - um if you can get everyone talking so
47:23 - that would be really really handy for
47:24 - you
47:25 - um okay dope um what was i gonna do next
47:29 - i was gonna say okay yeah so we're gonna
47:30 - talk about this
47:31 - now a few things right before we jump
47:34 - into the technical stuff
47:35 - i'm gonna take uh i'm gonna take two
47:37 - questions and then i'm gonna run you
47:39 - through my coding setup
47:40 - and then we're gonna jump into some
47:41 - actual coding technical work okay
47:44 - um so i'm gonna have we got two nice
47:47 - questions or juicy questions so uh well
47:52 - actually before we do any questions
47:54 - that if anyone wants to actually ask a
47:55 - question right now just go ahead and
47:57 - raise your hand
47:58 - uh this is a point where i like to sort
47:59 - of like have these little breaks in
48:01 - where you guys can feel free to sort of
48:02 - like
48:03 - you know it's like a break for you to
48:04 - get up stand up go get some water or
48:06 - something or just go ahead and ask a
48:07 - question
48:08 - um so feel free
48:11 - okay bradley go for it yes yes
48:14 - uh sonny can you hear me yep i can hear
48:16 - you loud included
48:17 - all right perfect um i was wondering if
48:20 - uh as we kind of set up
48:21 - a technical or just kind of set up react
48:25 - that you can maybe touch up on how to
48:27 - bring in
48:28 - um what's the word i'm looking for like
48:31 - bring in extra plugins that were custom
48:33 - made by
48:34 - other authors okay because i i know how
48:36 - to do like node package manager and
48:38 - install and and
48:40 - import but i've been trying to do a lot
48:43 - of research and every
48:44 - everything i found online just does not
48:46 - work for me so like um like component
48:48 - did mount
48:49 - okay i've been reading about that and i
48:51 - don't know how to employ that so i was
48:52 - wondering if
48:53 - you can uh kind of just briefly touch on
48:56 - how to
48:57 - import third-party plug-ins right so
49:00 - component did mount is actually
49:01 - something that's uh that's used for
49:03 - class-based components
49:05 - um so so that's actually something which
49:07 - is is more down to
49:09 - understandings of uh class-based sort of
49:11 - components as
49:12 - compared to functional so i will cover
49:13 - that today as well and i'll show you the
49:15 - sort of differences between the two
49:17 - um i think the way to go about this i
49:19 - think maybe there was a confusion with
49:21 - the question i think
49:22 - um the the setups so so the setup of an
49:25 - environment will pretty much
49:27 - be based on your extensions that you add
49:29 - on to vs code
49:30 - so firstly if you're not using vs code
49:31 - please switch now like
49:33 - like let's not have this fight on on
49:35 - live stream let's switch to vs code
49:37 - because vs code is
49:38 - is the like it's up and coming it's it's
49:40 - really good like and um
49:42 - and it makes your life so much easier so
49:44 - that's going to help you with your
49:45 - coding
49:46 - um but yeah we will definitely touch
49:48 - base on that
49:49 - when we get to and i think at that point
49:51 - bradley hold on to that question because
49:53 - when we're coding
49:54 - and especially when i cover class based
49:56 - first functional might be really handy
49:57 - to bring it up at that point
49:59 - i mainly i mainly do functional so i i
50:01 - didn't realize component did mount was
50:03 - only a class based component
50:05 - or a function so yeah yeah so that's uh
50:08 - that's uh exactly gonna be
50:10 - um that's going to be something which is
50:12 - uh
50:13 - is part of a class-based component and
50:15 - the way you can actually go ahead and
50:18 - um uh refactor that into a function is
50:21 - by the use of a use effect
50:23 - in a functional component right so any
50:24 - component demand component will mount
50:26 - all of all of the they're called life
50:28 - cycle hooks
50:30 - well not no sorry not lifecycle hooks
50:31 - lifecycle methods a hook is in the
50:33 - functional component
50:34 - everything every single lifecycle method
50:37 - in a class-based component is replaced
50:39 - by a use effect hook that's why i love
50:41 - them that's why they're so simple
50:43 - and i will show you guys how to replace
50:45 - each one
50:46 - with the use effect and use effect is so
50:48 - simple and nice once you know how to use
50:50 - it
50:50 - and it's just very clear as to what it
50:52 - does whereas class-based components are
50:54 - kind of like
50:55 - what the heck is component will mount
50:56 - against component did mount like there's
50:58 - two of the same naming
50:59 - and i see roundneck is like yep hit the
51:01 - nail on the head
51:02 - it's true dude i know like i'm like yo
51:04 - what the hell like you know is it
51:05 - component will man i'm using here
51:06 - component
51:08 - um so it's it's a normal problem to run
51:10 - into
51:11 - um okay so with that said let's jump on
51:14 - to
51:15 - second question i think we had a second
51:16 - question yep
51:20 - um
51:26 - hey dude so i have i have more of a
51:29 - psychological question actually
51:31 - basically
51:31 - okay nothing technical right now yeah so
51:34 - uh i have been in the
51:36 - uh coding background for around four
51:38 - years okay and before that also i was
51:40 - learning how to code in certain
51:41 - languages
51:42 - okay so my problem i have basically two
51:45 - problems combined into one
51:47 - one is the fear of you know the public
51:50 - facing
51:51 - yeah like whenever i see like there are
51:54 - too many people
51:55 - around me like if i'm going live or you
51:57 - know teaching someone
51:59 - you know i'll i'm like a little too
52:01 - scared to do that
52:02 - okay and second thing in during my uh
52:06 - coding time like uh i entered into new
52:09 - skills each and every
52:10 - time i have had a lot of setbacks
52:13 - and demotivations you know people
52:17 - of all those thoughts are there in my
52:18 - facebook they're there in my instagram
52:20 - okay and that that kind of also sets me
52:23 - back you know to
52:24 - actually you know share the fact that
52:26 - okay i want to teach and you know like
52:28 - whenever i say that yes i'm learning
52:29 - this even some of my friends
52:31 - they say do you know this you know that
52:34 - and then you know you get demotivated
52:35 - okay so even like right now i'm speaking
52:38 - to you i'm getting
52:39 - pretty nervous yeah well no firstly dude
52:41 - like as in the fact that you actually
52:43 - are
52:44 - asking the question in the first place i
52:45 - don't say well done like it's in it
52:46 - doesn't it it takes something to
52:48 - you know be able to do public facing
52:50 - situations now i actually want to answer
52:52 - your question
52:53 - in two ways so i will come back to these
52:55 - two points where you've got
52:57 - the fear of public facing situations
52:58 - which i think is not just you i think
53:00 - that's a very common thing with a lot of
53:02 - people
53:02 - i can pretty much say that um guys just
53:04 - go ahead and raise your hand if you're a
53:06 - bit nervous about public facing
53:07 - situations
53:08 - yeah so in the beginning i i'm for sure
53:10 - was like i'm not 100 words as well like
53:13 - so like it's not just you dude so like
53:15 - it's definitely a good question that
53:16 - you've asked
53:17 - also demotivation setbacks i actually
53:19 - love this question because
53:20 - something i will promise you all is demo
53:22 - like motivation will die okay
53:25 - in the beginning when we start this
53:26 - journey a coding journey like
53:28 - there's two things one thing is i love
53:30 - the fact that like the people who buy
53:31 - into the course the reason why
53:33 - we don't sell the course for twenty
53:34 - dollars is because one it wouldn't allow
53:36 - us to do what we do inside the course
53:38 - and two
53:39 - is because you're actually investing in
53:41 - yourself and that investment is stronger
53:42 - than the motivation sometimes
53:44 - now i can promise you when you start off
53:46 - your motivation is like this right
53:48 - so let's go ahead and say that this is
53:49 - your motivation levels
53:51 - right now when you start off your
53:52 - motivation is like sky high
53:54 - right you're like you're on fire you're
53:56 - like i'm going to absolutely crush
53:57 - coding like i'm going to be coding king
53:59 - like you're going to be the next papa
54:00 - react or whatever like yo you're up here
54:02 - right you're on cloud nine and the next
54:03 - thing you want next thing you know is
54:05 - that like you hit a debugging situation
54:06 - you're like okay
54:07 - i fixed it but there that kind of like
54:09 - you know that's a bit annoying and then
54:10 - you're going to run into a situation
54:11 - where you're trying to implement
54:12 - something else you know god damn it like
54:14 - i can't fix it oh man this is taking
54:15 - ages
54:16 - you know like and then you're going to
54:17 - reach this point then you're just kind
54:18 - of it's going to slowly creep on you and
54:20 - then it's just
54:21 - like this naturally will happen okay now
54:24 - there's a few things you can do here to
54:25 - attack the demotivation
54:27 - okay because this will happen to
54:29 - everyone it happened to me it happened
54:30 - to everyone that we talked to
54:32 - on on clever programmer and it literally
54:34 - will it's no different for
54:36 - people on this course so what i want to
54:39 - say is to attack this one community
54:41 - okay so community is very important
54:43 - every time you run into these problems
54:45 - chuck it on the slack channel talk to
54:47 - people because
54:48 - even if they don't fix the problem even
54:50 - if somebody says hey i ran into that too
54:51 - i don't know how to fix that
54:53 - you're you're not alone anymore and
54:54 - believe me be not being alone brings you
54:56 - a little bit up okay
54:57 - so that's going to kind of bring you
54:58 - back to a normality kind of point
55:00 - also if somebody solves your problem now
55:03 - you've got somebody else who you can
55:04 - constantly reach out to which means you
55:06 - compare program
55:07 - pair programming is also something which
55:08 - is funner it's going to bring you back
55:10 - up right then you're actually going to
55:12 - start com now celebrate the small wins
55:14 - so what we try to do is we kind of like
55:16 - i want to learn react okay
55:18 - now i don't even know like the whole of
55:20 - like reactors and if you ask me like to
55:22 - sort of cover everything in react i'll
55:23 - be like
55:24 - i mean portals i've used them once
55:26 - before i have no idea actually i have to
55:27 - use them again i kind of have to
55:28 - research that and touch base on that
55:30 - again
55:30 - like there's stuff in react which i
55:32 - don't know about but
55:33 - every time i build a clone every time i
55:36 - do something
55:37 - whether it's small or whether i learn a
55:38 - new hook or like i coded my first hook
55:41 - in one of the live streams once i
55:43 - celebrate that win
55:44 - right and that brings me back up some
55:46 - more okay so you see like you have to
55:48 - combat that downfall
55:50 - by celebrating the wins by joining in
55:51 - the community by getting involved
55:53 - and sort of pair programming and not
55:54 - being alone all the time
55:56 - and one thing i'll say is like a typical
55:58 - thing is like a typical sort of
56:00 - problem is that like people assume that
56:02 - programmers are introverted
56:04 - right like they're introverted and if
56:05 - you don't know what introverted means it
56:07 - pretty much just means like you're very
56:08 - like closed off you're very much like
56:10 - you know like i don't want to really go
56:11 - out and talk to people i just kind of
56:13 - want to go
56:13 - it's kind of like a stereotype you know
56:16 - yeah if you're a programmer you got to
56:17 - be introverted
56:18 - yeah when people try to be out an
56:21 - outro you know talk out and you know
56:24 - speak like
56:25 - like kazi you know you can take example
56:27 - for cause he's a programmer and he's
56:28 - like
56:29 - like a public speaker and what happens
56:32 - is people
56:33 - target him and say you are not a program
56:35 - you are a marketer you can say you
56:37 - they try to demotivate you when you try
56:39 - to be
56:40 - out of the stereotypes you know when you
56:42 - try to when you stick into the
56:44 - stereotype they say yeah
56:46 - you are actually a programmer but when
56:48 - you try to come out of the stereotype
56:50 - they demotivate you exactly exactly so
56:53 - you need to remember yeah and it's so
56:55 - true i'm not just said that like
56:56 - um so i'm just going to quickly
56:58 - highlight the points that we said so
57:00 - pair programming community
57:01 - and celebrating the small wins celebrate
57:03 - oh god that's a big win
57:05 - um let's go ahead and do this so
57:07 - celebrate
57:09 - celebrate small wins okay now oh oh big
57:12 - wins if you get big wins um so yeah as
57:14 - i'm off said
57:15 - yeah most people kind of carry the
57:16 - stereotype of programmers are introvert
57:18 - now trust me when i say
57:19 - this is going to hit you hard even when
57:21 - you land your first job now do you know
57:23 - how many people like i remember when i
57:24 - first went into my first job like i went
57:27 - in i was super excited i was like oh my
57:28 - god like i'm i'm gonna kill this like i
57:31 - feel like i'm doing really good
57:32 - and like there are developers sometimes
57:34 - who is like their sole purpose of just
57:36 - making you feel dumb
57:37 - like as in i'm telling you right like
57:39 - that you literally go into work you'll
57:40 - kind of be like
57:41 - you know like i'm going to attack this
57:42 - i'm going to take this feature on and
57:44 - they will just spit like
57:45 - jargon at you and like they'll spit like
57:48 - these big kind of words at you and
57:49 - you're just like oh
57:51 - like you know like i mean i thought i
57:53 - was good like and at that point is where
57:56 - you reach this point right like so so
57:58 - that's where you kind of have two
58:00 - decisions right so you reach this point
58:02 - here and you can either
58:03 - listen to them and you carry on
58:05 - spiraling down and pretty much your
58:06 - coding journey will probably come to an
58:08 - end at some point
58:09 - or you can say no screw that like
58:11 - i'm actually going to change the way
58:12 - that like people see this stuff
58:14 - i'm going to jump into a community of
58:16 - positive people i'm going to
58:17 - purpose i'm going to celebrate my wins
58:19 - and you come straight back up and i'm
58:21 - telling you guys
58:22 - when i when i tell you this like it
58:24 - really the really nice thing is
58:25 - is it doesn't matter about your age or
58:29 - your
58:29 - experience or if you've been coding for
58:31 - ten years or five minutes
58:33 - like it really doesn't matter if you're
58:34 - a positive person with an open mind
58:36 - then screw the senior developer
58:39 - sometimes who has like 20 years of
58:40 - experience or something
58:41 - because i'm telling you i honestly i'm
58:43 - and this is a true story i went in i was
58:44 - working at tesco once
58:46 - and i remember i said to a developer i
58:47 - was like oh um let's use a this this
58:49 - change this component to a functional
58:51 - component because it'd be so much easier
58:52 - to maintain
58:53 - and he was like and i was like let's use
58:55 - hooks he was like what's hooks
58:57 - and i was like are you kidding me
59:00 - i was like hooks are like the best thing
59:01 - that i've come to like react
59:03 - since like they came out and i was like
59:04 - i mean i thought like this would have
59:06 - been
59:07 - so it doesn't mean that just by being a
59:09 - like a more
59:10 - you know like by being more introverted
59:12 - by being like that stereotypical coder
59:13 - who sits on the computer
59:15 - for 20 hours a day and there's nothing
59:16 - else like no you need a balance in your
59:18 - life you need to make sure you do other
59:19 - stuff get out your social skills
59:21 - and that soft skill is going to be what
59:24 - allows you to actually go ahead and even
59:26 - land clients right
59:28 - it's going to be very big difference
59:29 - between the guy who doesn't know how to
59:31 - have a conversation
59:32 - or the girl who doesn't have to know how
59:34 - to have a conversation is going to go
59:35 - into an interview
59:36 - and they won't be able to close the
59:37 - client because they're going to be like
59:38 - uh i can code in java i can code in
59:40 - javascript c
59:41 - css you know i can do flexbox and i can
59:44 - do this and that
59:45 - and then like nobody wants to work with
59:46 - that guy you know like
59:48 - but if you come in like you're super
59:49 - happy you're bringing in good energy
59:51 - you're bringing in good vibes like
59:52 - even if you're like you know i don't
59:54 - actually know too much about redux but
59:56 - like i'm more than happy to learn
59:58 - i mean like if you can point me in the
59:59 - right direction i'm pretty much sure to
60:00 - go ahead and like you know get involved
60:02 - in that
60:03 - they want to work with you and trust me
60:06 - like i've seen it and i've been on the
60:07 - interviewing end
60:09 - i would rather interview i would rather
60:11 - bring someone on who has a lot more um
60:14 - sort of like positivity and good energy
60:15 - and wants to learn
60:17 - as opposed to somebody who's like you
60:18 - know they just come in with that expert
60:20 - mindset like
60:21 - i wouldn't even go into a job now and be
60:22 - like oh i know everything no i wouldn't
60:24 - i'd never do that
60:25 - right um so patch actually said a good
60:27 - point confidence is worth more than
60:29 - money
60:29 - in it yeah so like it's a hundred
60:31 - percent like confidence is worth more
60:33 - than money confidence is what is going
60:34 - to allow you to be the difference
60:36 - between
60:36 - a developer who makes like 40k a year to
60:39 - a developer who makes like 90 100 plus a
60:41 - yeah
60:41 - right literally through confidence now
60:43 - the one top tip i have
60:44 - is if you haven't already checked this
60:46 - book out please go ahead and check it
60:48 - out
60:48 - um i'm gonna go ahead and find it by
60:50 - john
60:51 - yeah i tell everyone instead inside of
60:54 - this like
60:55 - to go ahead and check it and it's uh
60:57 - this one here so
60:59 - um i need to make you guys a bit smaller
61:01 - for a second if you are
61:02 - if you are telling in gary's word it's
61:04 - like what people think
61:06 - you know yeah exactly like and it's true
61:09 - like honestly you know when we first
61:10 - started live streaming literally like
61:12 - screw what people think like who gives a
61:15 -  like if somebody says like oh
61:16 - you're a bit weird
61:17 - you're going on live streams like screw
61:18 - what people say man like you know like
61:20 - when you're making 100k
61:22 - then they're like i want to be like that
61:23 - guy you know like isn't it
61:25 - yeah yeah like yeah actually sunny this
61:29 - is one of the reasons
61:30 - that you know i have been interacting a
61:32 - lot in all the
61:35 - uh the trainings that have been
61:37 - happening
61:38 - yeah because i mean when i actually
61:40 - joined this thing and you know
61:41 - the the the particular reaction that i
61:45 - think i got was that no one is going to
61:46 - judge you and i've been trying
61:49 - trying in each and every coaching call
61:51 - yeah ask questions
61:52 - good but that i can get my fear away so
61:56 - very good hopefully i mean i'll really
61:58 - honestly
61:59 - stop getting nervous dude that's the
62:01 - first step that's the first step and
62:02 - honestly i'll come back to that exact
62:04 - point in just a sec
62:05 - um so guys i want you all to go ahead
62:07 - and like
62:08 - i mean the book's not expensive i think
62:10 - i i usually listen to audio books but
62:11 - this one i actually read
62:13 - um but yeah soft skills by john sonmez
62:15 - this changed my honesty as soon as i
62:17 - read this book
62:18 - i actually started to i literally
62:19 - started to make more money like i'm
62:20 - telling you like
62:21 - because i actually was able to land
62:22 - clients a bit better and things like
62:24 - that this is insane this book
62:26 - also another one is rich dad poor dad
62:28 - this one's just good for money
62:29 - management okay so like this is a book
62:30 - i'd recommend
62:31 - uh it completely changed my mindset to a
62:33 - lot of things and it also kind of
62:35 - combats this sort of
62:36 - stereotypical mindset of you go to
62:39 - university
62:41 - you pay this amount you you're gonna get
62:43 - a job at the end of it they kind of
62:45 - crush that with no screw that like
62:47 - you need to focus on the other skills
62:49 - you need to focus on like
62:50 - where are you putting your money in a
62:52 - 401k or you're actually investing your
62:54 - money so it's going to grow for you
62:55 - because yes as a developer we want to
62:56 - make money but like how do you grow your
62:58 - money you know
62:59 - like how are you actually going to like
63:01 - if you put all your money that you make
63:02 - as a developer 100k a year let's say you
63:04 - make 100k
63:04 - after tax you put that in a savings
63:06 - account like okay fair enough like you
63:09 - you might get to a point where you're
63:10 - very comfortable you're living a good
63:11 - life
63:12 - but if you invest that i'm telling you
63:13 - live a bloody good life like you live a
63:16 - really good life like
63:17 - and yeah sure like investment comes at
63:18 - risk but what nothing good comes without
63:21 - risk
63:21 - you guys all took a risk in what i hear
63:23 - right now and i'm telling you it will
63:25 - pay off provided you put in the work
63:26 - okay like there's never going to be like
63:28 - a magic bullet that you sort of like
63:30 - your magic pill that you take
63:31 - it's going to it's going to take that
63:32 - work and these are two books which i
63:34 - recommend that you all
63:35 - uh jump into it now i want to tell you
63:36 - something about amanat so aminat is
63:38 - actually i'm not how are you
63:40 - at the moment i'm 17. so i'm not just 17
63:43 - right
63:43 - i'm not came in after the first after
63:46 - the first challenge
63:47 - and i remember exactly because amanat
63:49 - was one of those people who
63:50 - i said to him i saw like aminat was
63:52 - really sort of like he had the energy
63:54 - here and everything
63:55 - and i'm not tell everyone what happened
63:56 - after our first call
63:58 - i was like uh seriously i i can't still
64:01 - remember like yeah
64:02 - first call and now the calls that we
64:05 - have almost like every day
64:06 - yeah it's totally changed you know when
64:08 - i joined
64:10 - it the call was you were on the call and
64:12 - yusuf was on the call yeah and like you
64:14 - were
64:15 - speaking all the time and you gave me
64:16 - chances to speak and i was like
64:19 - yeah okay i was i never spoke a word
64:22 - yeah but but now like what kaz said in
64:25 - the webinar
64:26 - now you can stop making me speak you
64:28 - know yeah exactly
64:30 - yeah and we actually influence that like
64:32 - if if you have if you're sitting in the
64:33 - back and thinking like i can't ask a
64:35 - question now i
64:36 - i can't when do i say it like me and
64:38 - cars kazzy actually say on the live
64:39 - streams we battle over each other
64:41 - sometimes we're like
64:42 - if you want to say something cut me off
64:44 - like literally just jump in and cut me
64:45 - off like and i i
64:46 - and i really recommend if you if any of
64:48 - you unmute yourself
64:49 - and say like hey sonny i want to ask
64:51 - this question like and i want to ask you
64:52 - right now
64:53 - i'm not gonna say like it's a bad thing
64:54 - i'm gonna say okay go for it shoot you
64:56 - should shoot your shot you know
64:57 - it's okay inside the zoom meeting
64:59 - because whenever you stay
65:01 - stay like okay i'll wait till i get that
65:04 - opportunity
65:05 - people are just gonna keep on speaking
65:07 - it's not never gonna stop you just
65:09 - gotta jump in the middle and then break
65:11 - all those
65:12 - talking and you just gotta go you know
65:14 - it's never gonna stop
65:15 - exactly exactly and so there's two
65:17 - points there like
65:18 - one take that leap because if you don't
65:20 - shoot your shot you're never going to
65:21 - have a shot like what think of it is two
65:23 - outcomes right
65:23 - yeah you go ahead and you maybe jump in
65:25 - and everyone like yeah you might get
65:27 - shot down or you might feel a bit
65:29 - embarrassed whatever like who cares you
65:30 - know like honestly
65:31 - you did something which just bettered
65:33 - yourself like even by asking the
65:34 - question
65:35 - aneesh even by like literally posing
65:37 - asking that question
65:38 - you just bettered yourself as a person
65:40 - like you just opened up that you just
65:42 - conquered that skill a little bit more
65:43 - you know that that public facing uh
65:45 - problem that you had and a lot of people
65:47 - in this call right now i'm telling you
65:49 - have the same
65:50 - thing that you're talking about right
65:51 - now right they have that sort of problem
65:53 - of speaking in public and things like
65:54 - that
65:54 - now trust me when i say i remember my
65:56 - first call i think uh aminata was
65:58 - actually
65:59 - sort of was there when i was prepping
66:01 - for it i was so i was freaking out i had
66:03 - like
66:04 - i think it was like 60 people waiting or
66:06 - something and i was like oh my god i was
66:08 - like oh literally i was like running
66:09 - around downstairs i was like freaking
66:10 - out i was like okay i need to like not
66:12 - mess this up i can't
66:12 - do it and now like you just throw
66:14 - yourself in the deep end
66:16 - and now like on youtube we've had
66:18 - thousands of people watching and you
66:19 - just handle it you know
66:20 - like just throw yourself in the deep end
66:22 - and just
66:23 - run with it the youtube calls are all
66:25 - the fun because they don't have an
66:27 - interaction with you
66:28 - yeah and you won't freak out if anything
66:29 - happens but now we are having 2
66:32 - 240 people in the zoom call and you're
66:34 - totally comfortable with it right
66:37 - yeah exactly yes like a niche like right
66:39 - now like it's in
66:40 - like that initial fear was more in your
66:42 - mind right
66:43 - like it was more sort of like a
66:45 - guarantee in your mind it was like huge
66:46 - it was like oh my god i can't ask this
66:48 - question right now
66:49 - but like now you've asked it it's like
66:50 - okay it wasn't actually that bad you
66:51 - know like
66:52 - like i said yeah because like i see you
66:54 - i see amanat
66:55 - i see patch i see frank and you know i
66:58 - see them so calm
66:59 - yeah you know they're like so cool and
67:01 - calm and you know it's it's if i could
67:03 - be like them yeah at the moment
67:06 - yeah dude you can you just gotta put
67:09 - yourself
67:10 - out there to become like that you know
67:12 - if you just keep on
67:13 - introverted you're never gonna come out
67:15 - you just gotta put yourself in the
67:17 - battlefield
67:18 - and that's how you get wounded every
67:19 - time and that's how you grow
67:21 - because i myself like if you
67:24 - if you come to my city or my place where
67:27 - i live
67:28 - people are never gonna motivate you
67:30 - they're gonna they are they are
67:31 - demotivate you
67:32 - and like for about four months i've been
67:34 - inside the house
67:36 - i never went out like i i got friends i
67:38 - just go visit them
67:39 - almost like once every week but before
67:41 - the covey and everything i used to go
67:43 - out every day
67:43 - and just was having fun but right now
67:45 - when i'm just changing people asking
67:47 - what the hell are you putting we cannot
67:49 - understand
67:50 - i don't care if you understand or not
67:51 - that's my that's none of your business
67:53 - it's
67:53 - mine you know it's my account it's my
67:56 - facebook i just keep posting because
67:58 - because they don't know the value and
68:00 - the returns that i'm getting you know
68:02 - exactly but once you once you start to
68:04 - grow
68:05 - and once you come to that level and like
68:07 - people are like wait anish
68:09 - is that you is that you who are posting
68:12 - all this stuff and like
68:13 - people who made fun of you are gonna
68:15 - come back and say man you know
68:16 - i'm really sorry uh you know i never
68:19 - thought you're gonna be doing this like
68:21 - i'm really sorry they're gonna ask
68:23 - forgiveness and they'll feel guilty for
68:24 - that you know
68:25 - exactly without yourself and go for it
68:28 - exactly and guys take jeff bezos as an
68:29 - example if you saw him when he was
68:31 - starting off right he's sitting in an
68:32 - office he's very much just like
68:34 - this like geeked out guy and he's like
68:35 - you know working on his little office
68:37 - now everyone wants to be bloody jeff
68:39 - bezos right everyone wants to be in
68:41 - in his shoes like if we said like do you
68:43 - want to be in jeff like
68:44 - if you don't know if jeff bezos is the
68:46 - guy who owns amazon like um
68:48 - he pretty much runs like just man in the
68:50 - world yeah he's the richest man in the
68:51 - world
68:52 - the guy's killing it like he's doing his
68:53 - stuff and then even elon musk same thing
68:55 - like when he was starting off like he
68:57 - was very very introverted very quiet
68:59 - very much like he just done his
69:00 - he's done his thing kept putting in the
69:02 - work reinvesting himself kept putting in
69:04 - the
69:04 - reinvesting himself and now like i think
69:06 - there's a really funny meme of
69:08 - elon musk is like uh before i used to
69:10 - code what people want me to call now i
69:12 - code whatever the i want
69:13 - like well now i build whatever the
69:14 - i want like guys building rockets tesla
69:16 - and things like that you know like
69:18 - honestly just go against the grain okay
69:20 - go against the grain don't get sucked
69:22 - into like the mindset of like
69:24 - you know like and the truth is i'm
69:25 - telling you the really
69:27 - tough reality of this is and this is why
69:30 - i know it's we're focusing on this for a
69:31 - while but it's really important because
69:33 - the the truth is is that the people
69:34 - closest to you sometimes
69:36 - right are the ones who might actually go
69:38 - ahead and and sort of be
69:39 - a be a holding sort of foundation and
69:41 - what we say about that is like family
69:43 - so a lot of the time sometimes family
69:44 - can be a sort of
69:46 - because family care about you so they
69:47 - want you to take the safe route okay
69:49 - say fruit sometimes is not always the
69:50 - one that's going to be the most
69:51 - lucrative
69:52 - but what i'm saying is go against the
69:55 - advice and just bloody run for it and
69:56 - jump off the cliff and figure out how
69:58 - you're going to survive on the way down
69:59 - okay hey sunny can i jump on on that yep
70:03 - go for it yeah no um and and um
70:06 - i i put it in uh i put it in the chat
70:08 - but like you know as
70:10 - some of you guys probably know i am an
70:13 - actor and a writer so public speaking
70:15 - and
70:15 - and being comfortable they call it being
70:18 - um
70:19 - being uh private in public so like for
70:22 - example if you're doing a play on stage
70:25 - you might have to do some like sort of
70:27 - intimate scene with the person you're
70:29 - doing
70:29 - and you have to be like comfortable with
70:31 - that so it's like it's the ultimate test
70:34 - to like sort of build your confidence
70:37 - and stuff like that so
70:38 - like that helped me out a lot and you
70:40 - know it'll be different for everybody
70:41 - but
70:42 - like if anybody like struggles with that
70:44 - like i'm happy to help you guys so if
70:46 - you want to like
70:47 - drop me a line on slack or something
70:49 - yeah dude that would be awesome i'm
70:51 - i'm literally trying to find you on that
70:53 - on the zoom call because i'm just
70:54 - looking for you right now
70:56 - if i can bmu definitely man yeah please
71:01 - so that was actually patch patch oh yeah
71:03 - i found your patch there you go
71:04 - yeah here we go so go ahead and and guys
71:07 - dm patch his name is patch moore
71:09 - uh he's on slack just message him and
71:11 - he'll be happy to go ahead and give you
71:13 - some advice on
71:13 - and patch is an actor like you said so
71:15 - he's actually very comfortable about
71:17 - being in those situations where like
71:18 - and apache you can imagine like when you
71:20 - first went in front of the camera
71:22 - it couldn't have been easy right it must
71:24 - have been quite like terrifying inside
71:26 - yeah like and and like i think it kind
71:28 - of ties into
71:29 - the concept that uh people fear what
71:33 - they don't understand
71:34 - yeah and so like you know when i first
71:36 - had my first on-camera audition it was
71:38 - like well
71:39 - i don't really know what to expect i'm
71:41 - sort of in the dark like i don't know
71:42 - what's gonna happen
71:43 - i don't know what i'm like supposed to
71:45 - be doing and like there's all these
71:47 - things but it just came with repetition
71:49 - and you know
71:50 - since i haven't been working for the
71:52 - last six months because my bar's been
71:53 - closed but i've put myself on tape
71:56 - over 30 times just in these six months
71:59 - just because like it's like it's like
72:02 - it's like your car or if you play guitar
72:05 - or you know even if you're a singer it's
72:07 - just like that maintenance
72:09 - and that like you know once you're
72:11 - confident
72:12 - like it's the whole world changes like i
72:15 - can't
72:15 - like i came from a small town
72:18 - i moved to la 11 years ago yeah and then
72:21 - i
72:22 - worked at one of the busiest most
72:23 - popular most
72:25 - insane bars in hollywood for three years
72:29 - and like i used to not be that good at
72:31 - least with
72:32 - talking to women right yeah and i worked
72:35 - at this bar
72:36 - i put myself in these situations where
72:38 - you kind of like i think i said the last
72:40 - zoom call like i've always been a big
72:42 - believer and kind of just throwing
72:44 - yourself to the wolves
72:45 - yeah so even if it's just like you know
72:48 - talking to somebody you wouldn't
72:49 - normally talk to or
72:51 - like i think the point the biggest point
72:53 - is find something
72:55 - in yourself that you are happy about
72:58 - like a quality with yourself like
73:00 - do you fancy yourself a good writer do
73:02 - you fancy yourself
73:04 - a good painter do you think you're a
73:05 - smart person like
73:07 - is there's like some qualities about
73:09 - yourself that you can really sort of
73:10 - like
73:11 - cling on to and have that kind of be
73:13 - your anchor because that can
73:14 - you can build your confidence from there
73:16 - and saying you know while i'm a smart
73:18 - person so i got that going for me that's
73:20 - pretty cool you know
73:21 - like the opportunities are really
73:24 - endless
73:25 - but yeah hit me up on slack if you want
73:26 - to if you want to chat we'd get
73:28 - something going
73:28 - exactly and i just want to highlight a
73:30 - key point you said there is find your
73:31 - anchor
73:32 - right like everyone's anchor's going to
73:34 - be different right and anchor is
73:35 - super important like patch said like an
73:37 - anchor is something it's going to be
73:38 - like
73:38 - it could be a quality about yourself
73:40 - that you sort of like you know like
73:42 - give some examples of like a quality
73:43 - that you were talking about patch
73:45 - well i i mean i'm i'm confident in my
73:48 - ability as an actor i'm confident my
73:50 - ability is a musician
73:51 - as a writer i know i know i'm a good
73:54 - person
73:55 - you know um you know those are just
73:59 - some of the things um so then it's like
74:01 - you know when i have interactions with
74:03 - people or when i go talk about
74:05 - stuff with people that maybe they don't
74:07 - necessarily care about it's like
74:09 - you know you also have to have that sort
74:11 - of like empathy and understanding where
74:12 - it's like you have to be comfortable
74:14 - being alone
74:16 - yep that was a lot of what i did when i
74:18 - first about
74:19 - seven years like i was single yep and i
74:21 - was like and i was okay with that
74:23 - because i was learning about myself and
74:25 - i was bettering myself and i was
74:26 - constantly
74:28 - trying to learn a new skill or something
74:30 - like that and so like that's another
74:32 - big thing is like as soon as you're
74:34 - comfortable being alone
74:36 - yep like don't get me wrong my
74:37 - girlfriend's not here so i'm not
74:39 - obligated to say this but i love the
74:40 -  out of her
74:41 - yeah and she's great and we and we uh
74:44 - and we live together and stuff like that
74:46 - but you know
74:47 - at the same time like as much as you as
74:49 - much as we love each other
74:50 - we didn't we enjoy our alone time
74:52 - because we know that's when we have time
74:54 - to
74:54 - uh reflect on the day or think about
74:58 - something that's bothering you
74:59 - or try to you know work out a little
75:02 - debug in your head if you will
75:04 - yeah exactly and i want to add to that
75:05 - like sometimes also understanding how to
75:07 - handle being wrong guys it's not just in
75:09 - the relationship since like
75:10 - being alone can be a lot of different
75:12 - situations right like when you're coding
75:14 - and you're debugging
75:15 - and you get stuck on a problem you can
75:17 - sometimes feel like you're the only
75:18 - person
75:19 - in the world right now who's stuck on
75:20 - that problem and you're like
75:22 - everyone else's code works but like mine
75:24 - doesn't work and i just feel like i'm
75:25 - you know i'm alone
75:26 - you can feel like that a lot because
75:28 - when i was learning in the beginning
75:29 - especially early in my journey
75:31 - there were so many points in the in the
75:33 - journey where i was just like debating i
75:35 - was like you know maybe i'm not cut out
75:36 - for this like i don't feel like i'm
75:38 - really you know made to do this stuff
75:39 - like and if i kept that mindset i would
75:41 - not be here today
75:42 - right like and and understanding how to
75:44 - be alone say it's many forms right
75:46 - it's being happy with yourself
75:48 - internally because if you're not happy
75:49 - with yourself internally
75:50 - how can you have a relationship how can
75:51 - you have any and relationship with
75:53 - someone else and a relationship with
75:54 - your job that sort of stuff
75:55 - it really does boil down to sort of
75:57 - fundamentals for me
75:59 - my anchors just as an example like the
76:00 - gym is an anchor for me like going to
76:02 - the gym is a very good anchor for me
76:04 - i can i can go there i can be with
76:05 - myself right i can actually just think i
76:08 - can vent i can do whatever i need to do
76:09 - some people like my girlfriend's anchor
76:11 - is dance she does a lot of dancing like
76:13 - that's really good for her
76:14 - she is time for where she can just be
76:16 - happy in her own
76:17 - sort of like domain and feel good right
76:20 - like everyone else you sound like
76:21 - another really good one is meditation
76:23 - right so if you guys don't already
76:24 - meditate like i think his meditation is
76:26 - a really good anchor that you can do and
76:27 - it
76:27 - allows you to sort of like be by
76:29 - yourself and it's just being present so
76:31 - like if you find that
76:32 - you're you're a parent or like you have
76:34 - children or something like that and you
76:35 - don't get much time to be by yourself
76:37 - sometimes 20 minutes of meditation can
76:39 - make you feel like you've just suddenly
76:41 - got hours back of your life
76:42 - because you kind of have that sort of
76:44 - like that that sort of mindfulness back
76:47 - and even when i do it for 20 minutes
76:48 - it's kind of like it just puts things
76:50 - it kind of irons out all the wrinkles in
76:52 - my head like all those little crazy
76:54 - thoughts are going mad like
76:55 - just mentally for 20 minutes and and we
76:57 - actually have frankie on the team who's
76:58 - a very big believer in meditation and
77:00 - sometimes as a team we meditate like we
77:02 - literally jump on the zoom core and we
77:03 - just meditate so if you guys want to try
77:05 - it out maybe find somebody else in the
77:06 - community who's
77:07 - who also wants to do that and that will
77:09 - actually help
77:10 - help you a lot and also melissa says me
77:12 - and sleep fight a lot
77:14 - so sleep is huge right sleep is like
77:16 - honestly like if you neglect sleep
77:18 - you're going to see a decline in
77:19 - everything
77:20 - okay like i'm telling you for sure yeah
77:23 - like leap is crucial to
77:25 - to life literally yeah honestly and
77:27 - actually a book i'm reading right now is
77:29 - why we sleep
77:30 - by matthew walker right that's a really
77:32 - good book and like if you guys are
77:33 - questioning ever that you're like you
77:35 - know it's sleep really that important
77:36 - honestly go ahead and read that book
77:38 - because i'll go ahead and put up on the
77:40 - screen as we talk about it but
77:41 - um sleep is basically going to be one
77:43 - and the problem with sleep is is right
77:44 - as a coder we kind of think we watch all
77:47 - these films and stuff as like what our
77:48 - coders should be
77:50 - and then we're kind of stuck on this
77:51 - like mindset of you know i need to be up
77:53 - late at night i need to kind of code
77:55 - early in the morning like because i need
77:56 - to code for hours into the night
77:58 - sure there are times where i've coded
78:00 - all night and i've kind of done that
78:01 - right
78:02 - but if you said to me would you
78:03 - recommend that i'll say hell no
78:05 - okay don't do that because that's gonna
78:07 - really mess everything up like
78:09 - you learn when you sleep right so this
78:11 - is a really good book by the way um i
78:13 - recommend everyone
78:13 - i actually i'm listening to it right now
78:15 - on audible um it's a really good book
78:17 - and it tells you pretty much just like
78:18 - the fundamentals of why we sleep okay
78:20 - so that's going to be really good for
78:21 - you guys but yeah um
78:24 - that's going to be really really
78:25 - fundamental for you guys now um
78:28 - we talked about the motivation levels
78:29 - and this sort of stuff now i want to
78:31 - come back to the point of
78:32 - a niche quickly and say that like the
78:34 - fear of public facing situations is okay
78:36 - it's a normal thing i had it everyone
78:38 - has it put yourself
78:40 - in those situations head first it's like
78:42 - a swimming pool if you if you're scared
78:43 - of swimming and you never get in the
78:44 - water
78:45 - how do you ever expect to get over and
78:47 - figure out how to swim
78:48 - right just jump in the water and
78:49 - honestly that's how i actually learned
78:51 - my uncle just threw me in the pool and i
78:52 - just started swimming like a kicking
78:54 - around and
78:54 - before you know you kind of find your
78:55 - feet and you're kind of flowing okay now
78:58 - the point is that you have to put
78:59 - yourself in the situation so that's
79:00 - number one number two
79:01 - we we talked about a ton of different
79:03 - techniques as to sort of how you can
79:04 - stay motivated right
79:06 - and sort of how you can prevent those
79:07 - setbacks now with that said
79:10 - i think let's jump into a little bit of
79:11 - tech stuff because um
79:13 - i think that was awesome that's really i
79:14 - think there's a lot of knowledge bombs i
79:16 - think
79:17 - that benefited a lot of us because
79:18 - honestly without that
79:20 - foundation it can really be difficult to
79:22 - start piling on knowledge and sort of
79:24 - piling on all this challenging stuff
79:27 - and um and it can really just crumble
79:28 - you and sort of ruin your journey so
79:31 - i'm gonna go ahead and pop you guys to
79:32 - the side right now so you guys can see
79:33 - over here
79:34 - and
79:41 - uh it's really quiet right now
79:46 - um say that again
80:02 - yeah so so this is actually before it's
80:04 - a good point to introduce this so before
80:06 - we jump into the technical stuff
80:07 - problem-solving skills right everyone
80:09 - always wants to know like whether it's
80:10 - algorithms or this or that or problem
80:11 - solving
80:12 - my advice to you is learn through just
80:14 - doing okay so like honestly
80:16 - the best way you're going to learn how
80:17 - to break down a problem is going ahead
80:19 - and just literally
80:21 - starting like as in approach more
80:23 - problems as in literally start like if
80:25 - you want to
80:25 - if you want to find out how like get
80:27 - better at uh sort of problem solving
80:29 - take a clone and build it right i know
80:31 - it's like you might see it as always
80:32 - copying in this map but no
80:34 - you're going to run into problems when
80:35 - you're doing it right there's going to
80:36 - be something doesn't work
80:38 - um i remember amanat when he first
80:40 - wanted to learn react
80:41 - right i remember he messaged me he was
80:42 - like something that something doesn't
80:43 - work on my computer
80:44 - i like is it like npm and store isn't
80:46 - working and then i kind of like i
80:48 - deliberately wasn't replying as much
80:50 - because i was like
80:51 - i'm gonna let him sort of like you know
80:54 - like brew
80:54 - in that sort of that pain right and i
80:56 - know it really sounds really evil but
80:58 - that pain and that sort of you know a
81:00 - bit of suffering when you're kind of
81:01 - debugging right
81:02 - is a it's the best teacher you're ever
81:04 - going to have
81:05 - and that is how you get better at
81:07 - problem solving that's how you get
81:08 - better because when you get like let's
81:10 - say you land a client right and it's a
81:11 - huge job
81:12 - honestly every single freelancing job
81:14 - i've had right
81:15 - i'm telling you now i'll be honest with
81:17 - you when they sort of say to me like
81:18 - this is the job that we want you that
81:20 - this is what we want you to build
81:21 - i'm telling you there's a part of me in
81:23 - my brain that's like i have no damn idea
81:25 - how to start with that like i have no
81:26 - idea how to
81:27 - build that right but what i'll do is i
81:30 - go ahead and i like break it down like
81:32 - you you're breaking it down and like the
81:34 - best way to break it down is there's no
81:35 - like written rule to this
81:37 - there's not going to be a case of like a
81:38 - way i can say to you like why don't you
81:40 - do this is this
81:41 - instead my best effort would be to show
81:43 - you how
81:44 - like i have broken down problems because
81:46 - the way i break down problems isn't
81:48 - going to be the way that you break down
81:49 - problems
81:50 - that's something to know as well like um
81:52 - and the only way you can really find how
81:54 - you
81:55 - sort of best go ahead and sort of get
81:57 - into like breaking down like a problem
81:58 - like a coding situation is
82:00 - you'll find debugging techniques that
82:02 - work for you and i can share my
82:03 - debugging techniques i use console log
82:04 - all the time
82:05 - i don't bother using the fancy debugging
82:07 - tools i literally used it for a bit
82:09 - and i kind of got fed up with using it
82:10 - because it just took ages so i used to
82:11 - cons i literally console log
82:13 - smiley face debug point one and i just
82:15 - do like
82:16 - i output some stuff debug point two and
82:18 - i just output some stuff like yo
82:19 - look over here like and i'll put some
82:21 - stuff like then literally that's what
82:22 - works for me right because i have no
82:24 - fancy sort of debugging technique i
82:25 - literally like yo
82:26 - look over here man like it's in and and
82:29 - if we get to that point i'm like okay
82:30 - we're good
82:30 - like that's the best way and it says
82:33 - debugging
82:34 - is is honestly often a messy way of um
82:38 - it's a messy way of like actually going
82:40 - to her ahead and
82:41 - breaking down a problem and i think the
82:43 - best thing we can do is jump into it
82:45 - and you'll slowly form your
82:47 - understanding of how you can you know
82:49 - break down problems
82:51 - uh with that said guys what i'm going to
82:53 - do is i'm going to show you so
82:56 - you all should have vs code downloaded
82:58 - um
82:59 - so i'm going to go ahead and pull it up
83:00 - now um
83:05 - okay let me go ahead and why isn't it
83:08 - because it's super big right now
83:10 - so i don't think i actually need to make
83:11 - it so big now because
83:13 - i mean i know i think you guys can see
83:15 - that pretty clear right
83:17 - um yeah so just zoom in so that's pretty
83:20 - easy
83:21 - okay okay so i think like like this is
83:24 - pretty good right
83:25 - yep so before we get started i'm going
83:28 - to show you my extensions okay so
83:30 - when you open up vs code so let's just
83:32 - assume you're on a blank canvas right
83:34 - now
83:34 - i'm actually going to go ahead and bring
83:35 - out the welcome so i'm going to make it
83:37 - like you literally just started vs code
83:39 - okay this is what you're going to see
83:41 - now there's a few things oops let me go
83:43 - ahead and get rid of this
83:44 - so there's a few things that you want to
83:45 - know it's like all the stuff on the left
83:47 - hand side oh man i hate when it does
83:48 - that all the stuff on the left hand side
83:50 - is sort of like the navigation panel
83:52 - okay so this
83:53 - the thing over here this building block
83:55 - is called extensions
83:56 - right so everything here is known as
83:59 - extensions and what you can basically do
84:01 - is you can plug
84:01 - and play like a lot of things a lot of
84:04 - different things into your app and like
84:06 - there's a lot of different things into
84:07 - your workspace and it's going to allow
84:08 - you to basically make your workflow a
84:10 - lot easier
84:11 - so that you can actually enjoy coding a
84:12 - lot more so
84:15 - we click it and i'll show you the
84:16 - extensions that i have and i want you
84:17 - guys to actually go ahead and install
84:19 - these because
84:19 - this will make your life a lot easier
84:21 - right so um
84:23 - and remember this is recorded right so
84:25 - this is going to be recorded you'll have
84:26 - access to
84:27 - all of this call afterwards so like even
84:28 - if you want to just pay attention and
84:30 - watch it now that's fine if you want to
84:32 - code along with me that's fine
84:33 - literally just do it whatever works for
84:35 - you guys but it's going to be recorded
84:36 - and it's always going to be there for
84:37 - you guys
84:37 - and available as a resource um so i
84:40 - don't you don't need python here uh that
84:42 - was for something else
84:43 - but prettier is number one so prettier
84:45 - is actually really good because
84:46 - we find that often we're sort of like
84:48 - code formatting like you
84:50 - what i'll say is that like you don't
84:51 - want to get into a point where
84:53 - it's it's always it's always going to be
84:55 - like
84:56 - oh my code isn't indented correctly you
84:58 - know like i need to indebt my code blah
85:00 - blah
85:00 - so i'll go ahead and pull up a file and
85:01 - show you printer in action so let's go
85:03 - ahead and say i have like app.js i have
85:05 - some code here there's some random code
85:07 - from yesterday's build
85:08 - and let's say like don't worry about the
85:11 - logic here guys like there is no
85:12 - i'm not trying to show you code to
85:14 - understand it here i'm just showing you
85:15 - an example
85:16 - so let's say we have some code here and
85:18 - let's say i have const name equals sunny
85:20 - right so sunny and then i don't want to
85:22 - do a console log and let's just say like
85:24 - i'm going to mess up my indentation
85:25 - right so i'm just gonna do console.log
85:27 - and then it's gonna be like this i'm
85:29 - gonna have like some massive gaps and
85:31 - stuff like that and i'm just gonna be
85:32 - like okay some spacing there and
85:34 - the truth is is that your code sometimes
85:36 - gets super ugly and we all been there
85:38 - when we're like okay yeah everything's
85:39 - kind of going out of whack you know
85:41 - um and now what i do is as soon as i hit
85:43 - save
85:45 - boom it pretty fires it it gets all the
85:48 - it makes the single quotes double quotes
85:49 - like it gets rid of everything it puts
85:51 - everything in line
85:52 - it will even get to the point of where
85:53 - it will drop things on new lines like
85:55 - this so it's
85:56 - easy to read um and and that's something
85:59 - you don't want to like if i ever find a
86:01 - code editor where i have to manually do
86:02 - this
86:03 - i i immediately like freak out i'm like
86:05 - okay why am i doing this manually
86:07 - sony i have a question about printer
86:10 - okay
86:10 - i my vs code i don't like to save
86:13 - manually so i put it on autosave yup
86:17 - but i don't uh kind of get it to
86:20 - function automatically
86:22 - okay good good good question yeah so the
86:24 - way you actually fix that
86:26 - is you go up to the top over here so uh
86:29 - go to if you're on the windows
86:31 - i think it might be a little bit
86:32 - different but you go to in mac you go to
86:34 - preferences
86:35 - and the shortcut for this is you click
86:36 - um in in
86:38 - windows you do in mac you do command and
86:41 - i think it's backtick oh no come on is
86:43 - it back to oh come on comma
86:44 - yeah come on comma yeah it's how you get
86:46 - to this page very quickly
86:48 - now what you want to do is okay so you
86:50 - can have auto save here so that's what
86:52 - uh andresa
86:53 - used now so he's talking about this
86:54 - right now you can actually set it to
86:56 - automatically save your files i don't
86:58 - personally
86:59 - like this too much because what happens
87:00 - is as i'm typing code and if it auto
87:03 - saves it may go ahead and like format my
87:05 - code and it kind of throws me off for
87:06 - flow
87:07 - like when i'm sort of writing my code i
87:08 - like to just get into i get into a good
87:10 - habit of just doing command s command
87:11 - that's command
87:12 - s like um but what you need to do is you
87:14 - need to go here and say format on save
87:17 - okay and this option has to be ticked
87:20 - all right so format on save so once you
87:22 - install print so step one go to
87:24 - extensions go prettier code format make
87:26 - sure you enable this
87:27 - so enable this and install that step two
87:30 - is you need to go to step two is you
87:34 - need to go here
87:35 - um to your uh settings so remember
87:38 - command
87:39 - comma and type in format on save
87:42 - and enter and then you see this make
87:44 - sure it's ticked okay now what this
87:46 - will do is it means that when you type
87:48 - in sort of like
87:49 - like you you sort of like say if i mess
87:50 - up the indentation here for example so
87:52 - let's go ahead and just like indent this
87:54 - a hell of a lot as soon as i hit save it
87:56 - runs prettier and it formats it
87:58 - okay so a lot of you guys who use priya
88:01 - might be wondering like oh i installed
88:02 - it i enabled it but it doesn't work
88:04 - that's why okay so you have to go ahead
88:05 - and do that as an extra step
88:07 - so that's the first thing i hope that
88:08 - helped andre by the way
88:12 - actually kind of doesn't i see it oh the
88:15 - saving but
88:17 - can you try it with your auto save on
88:19 - please uh
88:20 - yeah so if you're using or save the
88:22 - chances are i mean it could be a few
88:24 - things
88:25 - what i would say is send me a message
88:26 - afterwards but what you might
88:28 - need to do is actually go ahead and do
88:30 - um uh
88:32 - format uh i think is format yeah default
88:35 - format here
88:36 - maybe you have to also set your default
88:37 - formatter or something like that
88:39 - might be the case for it but uh
88:41 - definitely it could be something local
88:43 - to your machine so uh let's go ahead and
88:44 - check it afterwards
88:46 - um yep uh yeah
88:49 - sunny i had a question that my embed
88:51 - isn't working
88:52 - okay yes a good question so emma when
88:54 - you're using create react
88:56 - app right emit isn't going to work so
88:58 - emit is something that i use when i'm
88:59 - coding on live streams so you might ever
89:01 - you might see me writing components and
89:03 - being like this like no components but
89:04 - like
89:05 - some some jsx so the html there
89:08 - and sometimes i do this i say div dot
89:10 - and then i write like uh the class name
89:12 - for this might be like we're inside of
89:14 - app so i might be like app
89:15 - uh let's just call this like special
89:17 - container or something right and then i
89:18 - hit enter
89:19 - and then i get this that's called emmet
89:22 - right and it can do a lot of powerful
89:23 - things so you can do like ul
89:25 - and then you can say like even like
89:26 - inside of my unordered list have a list
89:29 - and now i want five of them and each of
89:31 - those unordered lists needs a class name
89:33 - of like
89:34 - uh hello world right
89:37 - and i want five of them and then boom i
89:39 - get another list with five elements
89:41 - right
89:41 - so i saw anisha's face was like whoa
89:44 - what the hell just happened there
89:46 - like yeah so like it's really powerful
89:48 - honestly and you don't have to write
89:49 - stuff out manually
89:52 - so that's going to be something which is
89:53 - really cool now i think it was pre
89:55 - said his it wasn't working for him so
89:57 - what you need to do to get it to work
89:58 - is you actually need to go to settings
90:00 - again and you need to go to extensions
90:03 - emit right then you want to go ahead and
90:06 - click on edit in settings.json so it
90:07 - doesn't matter which one just go ahead
90:09 - and click on edit and thanks for json
90:11 - and you need to add this snippet in here
90:13 - okay
90:14 - so emit dot include languages and inside
90:17 - of the
90:17 - uh the call right now i'm gonna go ahead
90:19 - and drop this in the chat
90:21 - so let me go ahead and boom i'll drop
90:22 - this in the chat for you guys
90:24 - uh emmet is really powerful and there's
90:26 - a bunch of videos online where you can
90:28 - actually go ahead and do that i've just
90:29 - dropped it in
90:30 - but yeah if you want to screenshot this
90:31 - now go ahead and do that but you
90:32 - basically add that into your settings so
90:34 - json for
90:35 - the emmet so you have to do it for mx so
90:38 - you want to go in here and edit saying
90:39 - switches and then i think
90:40 - um oh no sorry it's just settings that
90:42 - json based emit dot exclude languages
90:44 - include languages sorry and the reason
90:46 - why we need this one is it adds in
90:47 - javascript react
90:49 - right but if you don't do that then it
90:52 - actually goes ahead and um
90:54 - uh it won't it won't run emit for for
90:56 - jsx file so when you do create react app
90:58 - the files that we're actually coding in
91:00 - are something known as jsx files right
91:02 - even though they say js they are
91:03 - actually jsx files
91:05 - um andre says there's even a one free
91:07 - one-hour course of new to me about
91:09 - emmett really useful
91:10 - if you drop that in the chat um that
91:11 - might be actually really helpful for
91:12 - everyone to go ahead and check out
91:14 - that might be that might be really cool
91:15 - yeah um um
91:17 - sunny we just got two uh questions
91:20 - a person asking are we going to talk
91:22 - about style components
91:24 - yeah okay and the next one and the next
91:27 - one is is there a difference between
91:29 - prettier and prettier eslate
91:32 - so the first one is uh i'm not going to
91:35 - touch base on
91:36 - the different types of formats because
91:37 - there's beautify prettier
91:39 - i would recommend using prettier i think
91:40 - they use airbnb's styling guide as their
91:43 - default which is a very good styling
91:44 - guide
91:45 - um so i would recommend pritia because
91:47 - it's very opinionated
91:49 - right it's very very opinionated um this
91:51 - stuff like is in some people like
91:53 - they're styling a certain way
91:54 - when you go to a company they actually
91:55 - have a file sometimes which determines
91:57 - what the styling is so what priya will
91:59 - run
92:00 - um so it's very opinionated on that
92:02 - front but for the first one start
92:03 - components
92:04 - uh maybe it depends on where we get to
92:06 - today i may
92:08 - touch base i think i'd rather focus on
92:11 - creating your first react app but
92:13 - functional component versus class-based
92:14 - that sort of stuff as opposed to really
92:16 - diving deep into
92:17 - style commerce but uh definitely
92:20 - something we will bring into your
92:21 - coaching call yeah
92:23 - now another um extension that i would
92:25 - recommend guys is this one live share so
92:27 - this is going to allow you to
92:28 - whenever you see the live streams you
92:30 - see me and carsie coding this is
92:32 - uh something that's huge for this right
92:35 - um this is something which is really
92:37 - really big
92:38 - for um for pair programming so this
92:41 - allows you to sort of have like if you
92:42 - have you guys use google maps um not
92:44 - google maps google docs
92:46 - right so google docs it has like that
92:47 - real-time collaboration right where you
92:49 - have like some your name and like
92:50 - ammonite might pop up and cause you
92:52 - might pop up and
92:53 - and it just shows everyone typing at
92:54 - once right now that's going to be really
92:57 - really handy
92:58 - when you have live share so all you need
92:59 - to use live share as a github account
93:01 - you just need to set that up and then it
93:02 - all works okay so this is going to be
93:05 - something i'd recommend installing git
93:06 - lens is going to be very powerful for
93:08 - managing github stuff i would recommend
93:11 - installing it now
93:12 - and worry about how to use it afterwards
93:15 - we'll dive into a deep
93:16 - session on that one day es7 react
93:20 - snippets this one is massive
93:22 - okay now this one is hugely valuable i
93:24 - use this whenever i do any build
93:26 - so go ahead and to get this one just
93:28 - type in es7 um
93:30 - react or literally es7 i think it's the
93:33 - first one yeah
93:34 - yeah 7 react to redux graphql
93:36 - recognition bits and this allows you to
93:38 - type in stuff like
93:39 - a question yep go for it so i was
93:42 - building a rock paper scissors thing
93:45 - okay and um
93:49 - i ran into this problem okay
93:53 - can i share my screen um what was the
93:56 - problem
93:57 - that's this uh what was the idea when i
93:59 - was so i'm picking a random value
94:01 - from my array of rock paper scissors
94:04 - right
94:05 - and then when i try to compare it to the
94:07 - guess that
94:08 - they um have like put yeah
94:12 - it keeps on giving me try again try
94:14 - again when it's a po
94:15 - when i put in the correct guess so i've
94:18 - console.logged
94:19 - the random the correct thing right the
94:22 - random value
94:24 - i'm supposed to like what i would say
94:26 - what i would say
94:27 - is when it comes to anything specific
94:28 - like project questions or anything like
94:30 - that
94:31 - it would be better off to either share
94:32 - that in the slack channel
94:34 - so in proper javascript and then
94:35 - everyone in this call can help you out
94:37 - with that
94:38 - um which is the way that i and the
94:39 - reason why i do that is because you
94:41 - shouldn't rely on just one person
94:42 - one that's that's what my pure advice
94:44 - here but also like use the community
94:46 - that you've you've sort of
94:48 - entered into to actually leverage and
94:50 - help you out so drop that
94:51 - drop a screenshot of it and this is also
94:54 - a skill that you need to build
94:55 - how can you communicate the problem that
94:57 - you're experiencing right now
94:59 - so i want you to take a screenshot of
95:00 - your code send it inside a profit with
95:02 - javascript
95:04 - and explain in some text about what your
95:06 - problem is and what you expect the
95:07 - outcome to be
95:08 - and and that would be a really good way
95:10 - of dealing with it another thing to do
95:12 - is also message me afterwards
95:14 - and um i can dive in a bit more into it
95:16 - but as for specific code things
95:18 - we try and stay away from it on the
95:20 - coaching course but reason being is
95:21 - because we have 250 people
95:23 - on a call which and we want to keep it
95:25 - as much value to everyone at one point
95:27 - right
95:28 - um yeah okay so uh this is the final
95:32 - snippet guys now
95:33 - um what we're going to do now is also so
95:35 - let's go ahead and
95:36 - think about get lens yeah
95:40 - um get lens yeah get lenses this one
95:42 - here
95:43 - so i did recommend that one um git lens
95:45 - is really good
95:46 - yeah good lens yep so i actually
95:48 - installed this a very very good
95:49 - extension um so now what we're going to
95:53 - do guys
95:53 - is we're going to go ahead and let me
95:55 - move this out of the way
95:57 - right so we're going to quickly create
95:58 - our first react app okay so
96:00 - what we use to create a react app is um
96:02 - also
96:03 - yeah if you haven't already so your
96:05 - terminal probably doesn't look like this
96:07 - right you probably have all that
96:08 - squiggly crap in the beginning where
96:09 - it's like
96:10 - your laptop name or your mac your
96:12 - macbook or some
96:13 - some long piece of unnecessary string
96:15 - before you and then you have like some
96:18 - um some dollar signs sometimes right now
96:20 - to clean that up
96:21 - right i want you all to go ahead and
96:23 - download this um
96:24 - oh my zsh okay
96:28 - now this is we covered about this uh
96:30 - extensively in module number five
96:33 - oh nice soft profile javascript awesome
96:35 - yeah so module number five
96:37 - um but even even now if you're following
96:39 - along and stuff like that like or if
96:41 - you're watching along or watching this
96:42 - back
96:43 - make sure you go ahead and install
96:44 - myself stage it's it's a game changer
96:46 - for your terminal experience okay
96:48 - like it really really does make a
96:49 - difference uh leave says it's not
96:51 - available in windows if anyone knows an
96:53 - alternative
96:54 - drop it um uh it's already mentioned
96:57 - in the prerequisites the first one a
97:00 - unix like operating system mac os
97:02 - on windows wsl 2 is preferred but seguin
97:06 - or myself also mostly work
97:08 - quiet okay so you see that guys right
97:10 - now you might be able to use this one
97:12 - um i am mainly a sort of i'm mainly a
97:15 - mac user but
97:16 - you can actually run unix terminal in
97:19 - mac
97:19 - in windows now um i've done it once
97:22 - before but i haven't messed around with
97:23 - it too much but
97:24 - i would recommend doing that because in
97:26 - that way we're all on the same kind of
97:27 - a uniform thing and also something that
97:29 - i found is um
97:31 - a lot of people i mean a lot of
97:33 - developers it is a is very opinionating
97:35 - again
97:36 - um also david rakozy just said there's a
97:38 - way to have all my zsa on windows
97:40 - uh if anyone figures it out right what i
97:42 - would say is go ahead and pop it in
97:44 - in profitable javascript the chat the
97:46 - channel okay also they can
97:48 - shoot a loom video and share it like
97:50 - that how to install and how to make it
97:52 - work
97:52 - yeah exactly so that would be really
97:54 - beneficial to a lot of people
97:56 - um and and and remember guys the
97:58 - community is all community driven right
98:00 - so like
98:00 - providing value to someone else is going
98:02 - to come back to you in a different way
98:03 - and
98:03 - vice versa like it's all about just
98:05 - giving back and it will help you out in
98:07 - the long run okay
98:08 - um so now sorry and now what we're going
98:11 - to do is
98:12 - let's go to not in this one
98:16 - um yeah so now what we're going to do is
98:19 - so you'll get this
98:20 - once you install it so it's very clean
98:21 - look at looking there right
98:23 - so i'm going to go into my desktop so cd
98:24 - desktop if you don't know how to
98:26 - navigate also
98:27 - by the way inside of the terminal um i
98:29 - would recommend
98:30 - either take a udemy course on it like a
98:31 - free one or something or there's so much
98:33 - free
98:33 - don't pay for it like i would say don't
98:35 - honestly don't pay for it just so the
98:36 - main things you need to know cd and then
98:38 - you just need to go into your stuff so
98:39 - cd desktop
98:41 - i'm just going to go ahead and create an
98:42 - app on the desktop so i'm going to say
98:44 - mpx right now if you don't have mpx you
98:46 - need to install node
98:48 - um so node you can literally go on the
98:50 - website download node and install it but
98:52 - here we're going to say mpx and we say
98:53 - create
98:54 - react app okay now create react app is
98:57 - pretty much
98:58 - um what we use is something provided by
99:00 - facebook it allows us to basically
99:01 - create a start a template very
99:03 - easily okay now what we're going to do
99:06 - here is we're going to say the name of
99:07 - the project so in today's one we just
99:08 - say a to-do app okay we'll keep it very
99:09 - simple just say to do app let's keep it
99:11 - super super
99:12 - simple and whoa okay why is it debugger
99:15 - attached
99:15 - okay that's strange i don't want a
99:17 - debugger okay
99:20 - wait mpx pretty much
99:25 - whoa what happened there
99:29 - okay strange um
99:31 - [Music]
99:32 - what oh maybe you already have a to-do
99:35 - app
99:36 - folder on the desktop yeah i'm gonna
99:38 - quickly make a directory called uh
99:40 - let's just call that um coaching
99:44 - live let's do cd coaching live and then
99:47 - let's do it now so mpx
99:48 - create react up hopefully it can react
99:50 - out
99:52 - and let's just do to do um okay
99:55 - dude what the hell okay strange the demo
99:58 - got
99:59 - something saying auto attach
100:02 - smart okay let me go ahead next
100:05 - lunch let me go ahead and do something
100:07 - so i'm gonna just double check this now
100:09 - cd desktop
100:13 - um cd
100:16 - coaching
100:21 - okay now as we've got it here
100:25 - but it's your app and you just got this
100:27 - here strange
100:30 - okay there's something they're still
100:33 - installing
100:34 - down yeah when it really comes with this
100:36 - one
100:38 - why dude why are the demo gods like
100:40 - literally like
100:41 - kill they kill me like every time i'm
100:44 - live
100:44 - every single time i'm live okay so mpx
100:47 - uh
100:48 - npm install we've already done that um
100:50 - yeah switch from debugger i'm not in the
100:51 - debugger anymore i'm out there
100:53 - um okay so what we're going to do with
100:55 - trying here anyway let's do mpx create
100:56 - react app to do that
100:58 - uh okay boom and then in here okay so
101:01 - sometimes just do it in the terminal i'm
101:03 - not sure why that was
101:04 - freaking out maybe i had it running in
101:06 - the
101:07 - no i didn't have it running there okay
101:09 - but
101:10 - okay what to do
101:14 - let's go inside let's do it with us okay
101:17 - when stuff like
101:18 - this happens just be sure and go ahead
101:20 - and check out the actual documentation
101:22 - because let's just double check if they
101:23 - change something create react app
101:25 - maybe create react apps down or maybe
101:28 - they've changed it i don't know i mean
101:30 - they'll doubt it but that's strange it's
101:31 - first time has happened for me
101:33 - um some of these are something you have
101:36 - to auto attach in vs code
101:38 - i mean i'd i've never had to do that
101:40 - before frank um see
101:46 - yeah i'm here
101:49 - let's go back let's do it again
101:54 - let's try it with my app so
101:58 - to turn okay yeah
102:01 - so what did i type in npx create react
102:04 - app mpx create react app
102:08 - mpx okay either i'm going crazy and i've
102:10 - written it wrong
102:12 - or that is written correctly and we're
102:14 - good but either way okay it's working
102:16 - now
102:16 - um yeah i mean i don't know maybe
102:20 - maybe it just doesn't like to do up you
102:22 - know like um
102:23 - yeah um also somebody said a lot of
102:26 - people were trying to create lots of
102:27 - to-do apps right now
102:29 - yeah exactly um also guys why this is
102:32 - happening right
102:33 - this is kind of cool as well yeah this
102:35 - is pretty good i said while that's doing
102:36 - that by the way i want you to do
102:38 - something as well
102:38 - so inside of vs code i want you to do
102:40 - command shift p and this
102:42 - brings up this right here now i've got
102:44 - code insiders edition
102:45 - but your one will say install code
102:47 - command in part right
102:48 - go ahead and do that so command shift p
102:51 - so i'm going to quickly type this out um
102:53 - so i want you to do so it's command um
102:56 - shift
102:56 - and p and whatever the alternative is on
102:58 - windows please drop that in the chat
103:00 - and then yeah command shift p
103:04 - and then with that you're basically
103:06 - going to go ahead and
103:07 - um so you'll get to the point that was
103:10 - that so you'll get to this
103:11 - and then you want to do type in shell
103:13 - command right and then you'll see
103:15 - install
103:16 - code command impart now this is really
103:19 - like going to help you out with setting
103:21 - up your workflow okay so like i want you
103:23 - guys to get into a workflow of this
103:25 - so install that and then basically once
103:28 - you're you say like once your terminal
103:30 - is done right you'll get to this point
103:32 - so you'll get to
103:33 - you'll see this and let's go ahead and
103:35 - make this so it's already it's just
103:36 - still installing
103:37 - so then it says okay it should say happy
103:39 - hacking once we're done
103:42 - um so once it create react apps all
103:45 - set up we should be able to see
103:48 - everything inside so
103:49 - give it a second okay
103:55 - the show command is basically i'll show
103:57 - you how we use the show come on once
103:59 - this is done by the way
104:00 - basically what we're going to do is we
104:01 - basically write code
104:03 - dot for this like um directory
104:06 - and then what it will do is open up vs
104:08 - code and everything will be
104:10 - set up for vs code as in that given that
104:13 - you'll have the folders that we've
104:15 - just created have everything inside of
104:17 - this nice
104:18 - everything will be neatly done and it's
104:19 - how i've done everything inside of the
104:21 - coaching course so or even on the live
104:23 - the clone so you'll get to this point
104:25 - okay
104:25 - now when you're at this point i want you
104:28 - guys to go ahead and i'll make this
104:29 - super big
104:30 - yeah once you get to this point i want
104:32 - you to you do ls which means
104:34 - list all the things inside so i've got
104:35 - two apps now i've got to do app in my
104:37 - app but the one that we've done was my
104:38 - app so i'm going to go ahead and do
104:40 - in all my zsh you don't actually have to
104:42 - direct cd i will for this i'll say cd
104:44 - my app now we're inside and on my zsh
104:47 - also shows you what git branch you're in
104:49 - this is very handy right now when we're
104:52 - inside of here
104:53 - what we can do is i want to open up a vs
104:55 - code instance with
104:56 - everything set up inside of my app right
104:59 - so what i can do is for you guys it's
105:01 - going to be code dot
105:03 - for me it's code insiders and i'll show
105:04 - you how you can change that it's a new
105:06 - laptop for me that's why i haven't done
105:07 - it
105:07 - but you just want to code dot and
105:09 - basically you see what it did is it
105:12 - opens up
105:13 - a new so this is a new one and
105:16 - everything is inside of the my app photo
105:18 - yeah so you can either do that in the
105:21 - traditional way so you
105:22 - sometimes you go to here at the top and
105:24 - you say file open and do it that way
105:26 - but honestly this is the quickest way
105:27 - and it is the quickest way like i've
105:29 - done this like i've done
105:30 - so many builds and every single time i i
105:33 - use that
105:34 - right and it's a really really handy
105:35 - little shortcut now once you're inside
105:37 - here
105:37 - command j pulls up the terminal and
105:41 - here what you do is i do npm so it
105:43 - automatically installs everything
105:44 - before so you don't need to do that but
105:46 - here we can go ahead and do npm start
105:49 - okay now oh my god why is
105:52 - auto attached
105:56 - [Music]
105:58 - or attach disabled okay
106:03 - there we go
106:07 - so now it says compiled successfully so
106:09 - once that's done
106:10 - what you can do is you can command click
106:12 - on this link and it should take you to
106:14 - if it doesn't take you to just type in
106:15 - localhost 3000
106:18 - and your app runs okay so once you get
106:20 - to this point it's good news your app
106:21 - your first starter template is going
106:23 - well so what attempt to say hey
106:26 - hey exactly that's where you you pretty
106:28 - much go like and you
106:29 - massive
106:32 - a little celebration yeah now
106:36 - once we get to this point it's all good
106:38 - happy days right now
106:40 - um what i'm gonna do is
106:43 - every now and then i'm gonna make it so
106:46 - you guys can see it like as in
106:48 - i'll do it like this for now but i'll go
106:49 - ahead and minimize everyone for a bit
106:52 - so i'll do it like this so let me go
106:55 - ahead and actually change this screen a
106:57 - bit and there we go
106:58 - so um simon you just got a small
107:00 - question i guess
107:02 - okay yep go for it uh
107:06 - hey lately we saw that
107:10 - uh global installs of create react app
107:14 - are no longer supported
107:16 - uh so what's the issue related to that
107:19 - uh so repeat that question please what
107:21 - was that
107:24 - uh it was related to global installs
107:27 - for uh create react app
107:31 - i was no longer supported yes so because
107:34 - of that
107:34 - yeah so so that's a good point so a lot
107:36 - of you guys might actually go ahead and
107:38 - do something like this
107:39 - which i've like very um i'm highly
107:42 - against so don't do this
107:44 - so some of you guys might be like i can
107:46 - do npm install
107:48 - dash which means install it to my entire
107:51 - machine
107:52 - uh you guys can actually see there we go
107:53 - yeah install npm last year
107:55 - and then basically you would say
107:57 - something like um
107:59 - uh create react app right now
108:03 - uh who was who asked the question sorry
108:05 - i didn't catch your name um
108:07 - it's muhammad okay so muhammad just said
108:10 - that like you could do
108:11 - a global install like this right and
108:12 - then they said it's no longer support
108:14 - i am pro that decision because what has
108:17 - happened here
108:18 - is um you you don't want to install it
108:22 - globally
108:23 - just trust me guys like the reason why
108:25 - they've done this is because when you do
108:26 - this
108:27 - you're installing the current version of
108:29 - create react app on your
108:30 - your machine right and then you have to
108:32 - keep track of it and update it and
108:34 - things like that now
108:35 - you want to make sure that you always
108:36 - have the latest one which is why we use
108:38 - mpx
108:39 - mpx create react app basically goes to
108:42 - uh the registry where create react app
108:43 - is hosted
108:44 - so wherever it is on the internet there
108:47 - goes that
108:47 - gets the latest version so even if
108:49 - they're updated you're going to get the
108:51 - latest version and then you basically go
108:52 - ahead and build your app
108:54 - right that's why where everyone is
108:56 - favored for mpx
108:58 - um so mpx is a good way of making sure
109:01 - that you always
109:02 - uh go ahead and somebody says how do you
109:04 - get rid of that global install i think
109:05 - you can just go ahead and do
109:07 - um mpm uninstall
109:10 - g oops dash g create react app and i
109:13 - think that should do it
109:14 - if i'm correct yeah so if you want to
109:16 - uninstall if you've done that and you
109:17 - want to uninstall it that's how you go
109:18 - ahead and do it
109:19 - um i think that's correct yeah
109:23 - also mpx initializes everything and does
109:27 - and that's everything and in the way
109:29 - that you would expect it okay
109:31 - um so
109:35 - okay yeah so something that we we
109:36 - typically would like to go to global
109:38 - install
109:39 - is something like firebase tools right
109:41 - so npm i
109:43 - g firebase tools and this is something i
109:44 - use whenever we're sort of like
109:46 - doing live streams but if we're using
109:48 - firebase ever that's some that's an
109:49 - example of something you would like to
109:51 - globally install because it doesn't
109:52 - matter what project you're in
109:54 - i just want to have access to firebase
109:56 - on the command line so
109:57 - that's an example but don't want to dive
109:59 - too deep into that but yeah
110:01 - that was uh that one now i'll take one
110:03 - more question if anyone's got any
110:05 - questions
110:05 - so i think and then we'll get started on
110:07 - the hard coding stuff
110:09 - okay i think they're good
110:13 - yeah all good okay i saw somebody raise
110:16 - their hand but it doesn't say the name
110:17 - um yep you're uh during the glasses
110:21 - it doesn't say your name i can't
110:22 - actually see uh go ahead and unmute
110:24 - yourself
110:25 - just just go ahead and um i think they
110:27 - cannot meet themselves just
110:29 - ask them to put a chat yeah so i just
110:32 - clicked on ask to unmute
110:33 - um oh okay yeah
110:37 - yeah hi sunny i just wanted to ask like
110:39 - uh
110:40 - in angular we have worked on a project
110:43 - where we have masters and most of
110:44 - reporting stuff
110:46 - with many grids and all to edit so can
110:49 - we do that same
110:50 - using react so my my straightaway answer
110:53 - to that is
110:54 - separate your understanding of angular
110:55 - from react angular is a framework which
110:57 - means angle is heavy
110:59 - uh they basically angular has all these
111:01 - the angular has a set way of doing
111:02 - everything
111:03 - like you have to use their roots you
111:05 - have to use everything in their own way
111:08 - react is a library which means that you
111:10 - just have to make it
111:11 - um it just has to be very you only use
111:14 - what you need pretty much
111:15 - right so so use create react app as your
111:18 - starter template and then i'll show you
111:19 - how we strip it down and how we start
111:20 - building our project right
111:22 - um yep somebody noticed you in the in
111:25 - the youtube chat maybe
111:26 - someone said roshan josh his girlfriend
111:28 - is also attending yeah
111:29 - there you go nice um so let's carry on
111:32 - so now
111:33 - we have um here so we have the app
111:37 - wrapper running right
111:38 - so what i would do at this point is that
111:39 - me and kazi we always say is it's a
111:40 - cleanup process pretty much so i'm going
111:42 - to go ahead and pop this to the side and
111:44 - pop this over here
111:47 - uh so now it says don't raise tan
111:50 - uh just drop your uh question any
111:52 - question you have in the in the chat
111:54 - please and then what we do is we'll
111:56 - tally up and then we can go ahead and do
111:58 - it right
111:59 - um okay so we've got the source here so
112:01 - this is what you're going to get
112:03 - when you're starting off and you go to
112:04 - app.js and do command j to hide the
112:06 - terminal again
112:07 - but here you can pretty much go ahead
112:08 - and see that this is the code that's
112:10 - responsible for what you see on the left
112:11 - right so this is why we see everything
112:13 - on the left right now
112:14 - um and what we can do is at this point i
112:17 - just want to go ahead and go and this is
112:19 - like what i call the cleanup process
112:21 - okay
112:22 - so you just want to go ahead and get rid
112:23 - of this file oh god just doing the same
112:25 - thing again
112:25 - you're gonna go ahead and get rid of
112:27 - app.test.js get rid of this get rid of
112:29 - logo.svg get rid of setup test.js okay
112:32 - get rid of those things and uh we can do
112:35 - that very easily by just
112:36 - pressing command selecting them hit on
112:39 - command delete
112:40 - move to trash and doom there we go and
112:42 - it's gonna freak out because we've just
112:44 - deleted
112:45 - the logo and we've not updated the code
112:47 - so here we need to go to line two delete
112:49 - that
112:50 - and also go inside of here and delete
112:52 - everything inside the div
112:53 - and just put like a h1 right so put h1
112:56 - just says like hello
112:58 - hello world all right something like
113:00 - that and then save it
113:02 - and now we can see it says hello world
113:03 - right now notice how it's centered
113:06 - right so whenever we start an app it's
113:08 - centered right we don't want it to be
113:09 - centered by default
113:10 - so here what we can do is we're going to
113:12 - go to app.css
113:14 - and then we're going to do a command a
113:15 - and just delete everything
113:17 - we don't want any styling there preset
113:19 - right but we also we always get this
113:21 - like top bar
113:22 - right there's like a top bit of hidden
113:24 - space there now what you can do is and
113:26 - somebody asked can we delete alexandra
113:28 - says can we delete the service worker
113:30 - uh no keep that that's actually
113:32 - something so when we
113:34 - use create react app it creates
113:36 - something called a progressive web app
113:38 - the service worker allows very smart
113:40 - things like caching
113:41 - and it makes the app run faster so you
113:43 - want to just keep that you just you
113:45 - just don't ever touch this pretty much
113:46 - in a very simple way
113:48 - um unless you're doing like very very
113:50 - technical stuff um
113:52 - so yeah we go here and change the class
113:54 - name to a lowercase a
113:55 - because we follow something called a bem
113:58 - naming convention so if you don't if you
114:00 - never watch the live streams
114:01 - bem is a way of naming classes and it's
114:03 - something that i live by
114:05 - and i teach everyone to use and it's a
114:07 - very very good way of
114:08 - building very maintainable react apps
114:11 - okay
114:12 - so an index.css is the next thing we
114:14 - want to do is go here
114:15 - add a line where we do an asterisk and
114:18 - just type in margin
114:20 - 0. and i the reason why i do this is it
114:22 - basically gets rid of these hidden
114:24 - margins
114:24 - you see when i did that if i undo that
114:26 - for a sec it goes ahead and it pops a
114:28 - margin in
114:29 - and you see like we don't want that
114:31 - margin we just want a blank canvas right
114:33 - but when you don't do that
114:34 - everything has like a little top margin
114:36 - right
114:37 - um so a lot of people are saying how do
114:40 - i convert a react web app to a pwa
114:42 - uh no when you when you make a react app
114:45 - it is by default a pwa okay so when you
114:47 - use something like create
114:49 - create react app it pretty much goes
114:51 - ahead and does it so
114:52 - preet says this is quite late there
114:54 - thank you so much for jumping on dude
114:56 - uh make sure that you watch the rest of
114:57 - the the the recording afterwards soon
115:00 - and thank you for coming
115:01 - um right let's carry on so hello world
115:05 - so now we've got this right so what
115:06 - we're going to do today is we're going
115:07 - to build a very simple
115:08 - to do app okay and it's going to have
115:10 - some buttons it's going to be able to
115:11 - add a to-do
115:12 - i'm going to show you a few things when
115:13 - we do that and i'm going to show you two
115:15 - principles
115:16 - called props and state okay
115:19 - now my advice to you guys is master this
115:22 - props in the state okay so master this
115:23 - stuff oops what am i doing
115:25 - yeah uh master the props and state and
115:27 - now props and stay are basically the two
115:29 - main fundamentals in react okay um
115:33 - you're going to need a basic
115:34 - understanding of javascript when you do
115:36 - this but honestly don't freak out if you
115:37 - if you don't know that just literally
115:39 - remember this is this is going to be
115:42 - how you go ahead and actually just learn
115:44 - and build on that skill
115:46 - set and stuff like that right now
115:47 - project says i'm very new to this can
115:49 - can somebody help me out on how to set
115:50 - up all this stuff
115:51 - with the whole recording the whole thing
115:52 - is recorded so what i would recommend is
115:54 - if you came in late
115:55 - or if you're new and you're kind of lost
115:57 - just watch okay just honestly watch
115:59 - everyone in the call right now just
116:00 - watch and and sort of enjoy the content
116:02 - that you're seeing
116:03 - and because it's pattern recognition
116:05 - just by seeing it
116:06 - just by seeing what i'm doing you can
116:08 - watch it back and take it your own
116:10 - uh the pace but like this is going to
116:12 - help you sort of defeat that barrier
116:14 - right of of thinking it's too hard or i
116:16 - can't do this so
116:18 - what we're going to say is we're going
116:19 - to change hello world to a to-do app so
116:21 - this is going to be to-do app
116:23 - right we're going to save it and there
116:24 - we go we've got a basic to-do app now
116:26 - we're going to have a few things in here
116:27 - right so we're actually going to have
116:29 - we're going to have an input box so this
116:31 - is going to be a simple input field so
116:33 - if i hit save now we've got like an
116:34 - input field so i can type in that
116:36 - okay and i'm going to make this really
116:38 - big so you guys can see that okay no i'm
116:40 - not that big it's a bit excessive
116:41 - there we go now we've got the input
116:43 - field there
116:44 - okay and what i'm going to do now is go
116:48 - ahead and
116:49 - um yep i'm going to go ahead and
116:53 - we've got the input here and i'm going
116:54 - to have a button okay and the button is
116:56 - going to say add a to do
116:58 - right and now what is our goal here
117:00 - right we want to type in some stuff
117:02 - and i'm going to hit add added to do and
117:04 - the goal would be something like this
117:06 - right to have like a
117:08 - to do so like have some kind of to do
117:11 - pop up right now that to do
117:13 - would be underneath and it could have
117:14 - like a h2 inside saying um
117:16 - let's just say take dogs for a walk take
117:19 - dogs
117:19 - take dogs oh you know what actually
117:21 - better than this what i'll do is i'll
117:23 - say like we're going to basically say
117:24 - like
117:25 - let me go ahead and show you how i would
117:26 - do i'll say like take dogs
117:28 - for a walk right now when we when i
117:31 - click this button
117:32 - what do i want as an end goal right like
117:35 - what i want as and then go
117:36 - is pretty much i want to have like a
117:39 - somewhat of a to-do
117:40 - pop-up here okay so there's going to be
117:42 - a to-do it's going to have some text
117:44 - here so it's going to be like okay
117:45 - um it's just going to say like take
117:48 - um take trash out take over take dogs
117:51 - for a walk take dogs for a walk
117:53 - right so it's going to basically say
117:55 - this a walk
117:56 - yeah so but that's going to come up and
117:58 - then it's going to clear this box
117:59 - okay so it's going to clear this box now
118:01 - what i would recommend is when you're
118:02 - coding guys
118:03 - honestly break it down like this right
118:05 - so break it down like this
118:06 - and then we're going to basically like
118:07 - if you do it again it's going to go
118:09 - ahead and add another one
118:11 - and this one could be something like
118:12 - take trash out okay take
118:15 - trash out now there's a few things that
118:18 - we need
118:18 - to do or understand and enable to get an
118:21 - app like this working one of those
118:22 - things
118:23 - is basically this input right here
118:26 - we need to map it right we need to
118:28 - basically keep track keep
118:30 - track of what the user types
118:34 - right so we need to keep track of what
118:35 - the user types and in order to do that
118:38 - what we can do is we can actually use
118:40 - something called state
118:41 - okay so this is where state comes in
118:44 - okay so we use state to be able to do
118:47 - that right so we're going to keep track
118:48 - of what the user types and and we're
118:50 - going to use state now state is
118:51 - literally
118:52 - think of it as it's the state of the
118:54 - input field
118:55 - right so it's very simple to understand
118:56 - when you put it like that it's a state
118:58 - of the input field
118:59 - so in order to do that what we're going
119:01 - to do
119:02 - is we're going to use something called a
119:03 - hook okay now before we do that i just
119:05 - want to mention that react is all about
119:07 - component based design
119:09 - okay it's all about component based
119:11 - design and
119:14 - and basically what happens is in react
119:16 - is you would build one component so in
119:18 - this case a to-do
119:20 - component and you can pretty much go
119:22 - ahead and just reuse it so we can reuse
119:24 - this one and reuse this one
119:25 - and that's where props allows us to
119:28 - basically reuse it because
119:29 - if we had one component and i kept
119:31 - reusing it these things would be
119:32 - identical it would say like
119:34 - take dogs for a walk take dogs for a
119:35 - walk we don't want it to say the same
119:37 - thing every time
119:38 - right so how do we basically customize
119:40 - what it has inside of it
119:41 - and that is what we use that's where
119:43 - props comes in okay
119:45 - so props is a massive fundamental one
119:47 - basically it stands for properties
119:49 - and properties is essentially just going
119:50 - to be like i'm going to use this
119:52 - component i'm going to change this prop
119:54 - so the text prop i'm going to use this
119:55 - component more and change this one okay
119:57 - and these this would be like for example
119:59 - the to-do
120:00 - component okay so
120:03 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna break
120:04 - it down now right so we're gonna go into
120:07 - our code
120:08 - and we're gonna firstly we need to keep
120:09 - track of what's inside of here so
120:12 - we use something called a used state
120:14 - hook
120:15 - okay um preet says sonny we're going to
120:18 - party after all this yes we can
120:19 - definitely play r2 with this
120:21 - um so here i'm going to say const right
120:23 - const is how we declare a variable and
120:26 - here we basically go ahead and say
120:28 - input right let's go ahead and want to
120:30 - keep track of the input right
120:32 - and or we can say input text okay and
120:34 - then
120:35 - what you have next is a function now
120:37 - this function
120:38 - just think of it like even if you don't
120:40 - understand what i'm about to say just
120:41 - think of it and i just try and break
120:42 - this down so let's go ahead and say
120:44 - set input text right
120:47 - so i'm going to drop that in set input
120:49 - text right and then the second one the
120:51 - convention is whatever the first one is
120:53 - called
120:54 - the second thing inside of these
120:55 - brackets should say set
120:57 - and then you camel case so it's a
120:58 - capital i input text so
121:00 - input text is set input text if it was
121:02 - like input it would be set input
121:04 - right then we say use state like this
121:08 - right now if you see on vs code it
121:10 - actually goes ahead
121:11 - it goes ahead and it shows you the auto
121:13 - import and things like that so you can
121:15 - go ahead and click that
121:16 - and if it doesn't do that you can you
121:17 - have to import the use state hook up
121:19 - here
121:20 - but basically you say use state and then
121:21 - you put in the default value so
121:23 - initially when this app loads
121:25 - uh this should be blank right so we want
121:27 - this to be a blank string
121:29 - right if it was a list we would make it
121:31 - like a blank array
121:32 - but in this case it's a blank string now
121:35 - okay so this is basically
121:37 - the the simple way of thinking of this
121:38 - is like the
121:40 - react the the think of it like the react
121:43 - way of writing
121:45 - a variable right so just think of it
121:48 - like that
121:49 - okay um right
121:52 - now yes you have to have something in
121:54 - here right
121:55 - it's actually a function that you're
121:56 - gonna call and that's gonna be very very
121:58 - important
121:59 - um and uh and then what we're gonna do
122:03 - now
122:04 - is we have the uh added to do so we need
122:06 - to now keep
122:07 - track so when i type in here i want this
122:10 - variable to capture everything that i've
122:13 - typed so if i write in here
122:15 - um take um take sonny
122:18 - to a fancy dinner hashtag fancy dinner
122:22 - all right then we basically want to take
122:23 - something to a fancy dinner to be inside
122:25 - of input text
122:26 - right so inside of here what we can do
122:28 - is we need to go to the input field
122:30 - and and then we need to go to here and
122:33 - say
122:34 - value right now the value of the input
122:36 - field is
122:37 - um we're going to say input text right
122:41 - so so the value of this will be input
122:44 - text
122:44 - and now if i save it look what happens
122:47 - when i type in nothing like i'm actually
122:49 - i'm smashing the keyboard now and
122:50 - nothing
122:51 - is getting updated in that input field
122:53 - right so nothing gets
122:55 - updated because what i'm saying here is
122:57 - the value
122:59 - is always set to this blank value here
123:02 - so the part one is setting value here
123:05 - but what we need to do is we need to
123:06 - also say on change
123:08 - right so on change right and this basis
123:11 - as the user types in
123:13 - and what we can do here is we can use
123:15 - something called an es6 arrow function
123:17 - now es6 is just the new way of writing
123:19 - javascript it's like a more
123:21 - the more modern approach to writing
123:22 - javascript so here what we can say is we
123:24 - can say
123:25 - every time we type right it fires off
123:27 - something called
123:28 - a it fires up something called a event
123:32 - so here it fires an event and then
123:33 - basically we can say arrow
123:35 - and here we can actually go ahead and
123:37 - say set the input text
123:40 - right and this is like the bit where a
123:41 - lot of people kind of get confused but
123:43 - it will make sense in a sec you say set
123:45 - the input text
123:46 - um to event dot target and what dot
123:50 - target means is basically saying
123:52 - the event is the event gets fired off
123:54 - from this input field right
123:56 - the dot target is basically saying go
123:59 - ahead and grab
124:00 - the the the sort of input input field
124:02 - and then we want to say go ahead and
124:03 - grab the value of what's inside of the
124:06 - input phone
124:06 - now what i want to reassure you on guys
124:09 - is eid
124:10 - like whether it's event or whether it's
124:11 - e.target.value
124:13 - just get used to event.target.value just
124:16 - get used to that because it's honestly
124:17 - going to be a case of um
124:20 - it's going to be a case of you will just
124:22 - once you sort of practice that you you
124:24 - won't get so scared of like remembering
124:26 - event. and honestly i forgot this thing
124:28 - so many times okay so make sure when you
124:30 - build it once just keep that as a backup
124:32 - project to go ahead and look back at
124:34 - right that's going to help you out a bit
124:36 - now what happens is if i type in
124:38 - abc oh okay it's no longer frozen right
124:41 - now this is because and i can actually
124:43 - prove this to you guys
124:45 - if i pre if i press uh if i hold right
124:47 - and i click inspect
124:49 - what i can do is i'm going to just drop
124:50 - this on the bottom so you guys can see
124:52 - this clearer
124:54 - and if i go ahead and open the console
124:56 - and i'm going to hide everything here so
124:58 - now inside the console what i can do is
125:00 - i can actually say i can
125:01 - here i can say console.log
125:05 - console.log the input text right so i
125:07 - want to see if it is
125:08 - actually capturing the values or not so
125:10 - if i type in a
125:11 - okay it's doing it bc okay it's doing it
125:14 - now don't worry about re-rendering twice
125:16 - don't worry about that that's more into
125:18 - optimization and stuff like that
125:20 - thank you so much nicholas hale for
125:22 - watching good night and
125:24 - and make sure you watch this afterwards
125:26 - um
125:27 - okay uh i can see the chat don't worry
125:30 - um
125:31 - so now we can see abc and let's just
125:33 - type in hello and you can see everything
125:34 - is getting updated
125:36 - as we expect it to okay so if this is
125:39 - now being captured inside of this
125:40 - variable
125:41 - so now that we have that we can actually
125:43 - do the next step
125:45 - which is we can go ahead and say all
125:46 - right when i click this button
125:48 - i want to use that text and i kind of
125:50 - want to add it to a list of to-do's
125:51 - right
125:52 - so firstly we need to add that list of
125:54 - to-do's into
125:55 - our state we need to we need some kind
125:57 - of list inside of our memory or like our
125:59 - app
126:00 - to keep track of what's inside the
126:01 - to-do's right so that list of to-do's we
126:03 - want to keep track of them
126:04 - so here i'm going to say const i'm going
126:06 - to say to-do's
126:08 - i'm going to say set to-do's because
126:09 - that's how we do this and then we say
126:11 - equals
126:13 - and then we're we're gonna go ahead and
126:15 - say use
126:16 - state okay and then here we're gonna go
126:19 - ahead and do
126:20 - um open close brackets because it's an
126:23 - empty array
126:24 - right it's an empty list right that's
126:26 - what we're gonna do
126:28 - um and then what because because
126:30 - initially there's not going to be any to
126:31 - do's right
126:32 - we're not going to cover persistence
126:33 - right now we might be using um
126:35 - something uh like firebase uh and a lot
126:38 - of the clones we show you how to use
126:40 - firebase
126:40 - but today the main focus is mastering
126:43 - state and props
126:44 - okay so here we've got the to-do's right
126:47 - now
126:48 - okay so that's cool but when i click
126:50 - this button
126:51 - right i want to basically fire off
126:53 - something now this is why this is my
126:54 - approach to doing this and this is what
126:56 - i would recommend
126:57 - is the best approach to sort of handling
126:58 - this now okay so um
127:01 - uh oh god where's it going yeah okay let
127:03 - me go ahead and change this
127:04 - yeah so now what we're going to do is
127:05 - we're going to say on click so button on
127:07 - click
127:08 - so as soon as i click this button i need
127:10 - to fire off a function and what i'm
127:11 - going to say is i'm going to create a
127:12 - function
127:13 - so a function all it is is a piece of
127:15 - code right it's a piece of code that's
127:17 - just going to
127:17 - be executed so here i'm going to say
127:19 - const add
127:21 - a to do right this is the function that
127:24 - gets clicked off
127:25 - that gets fired off when i add the to-do
127:28 - and then what i'm going to do is just to
127:29 - test it that it works i'm going to say
127:31 - console.log ouch you clicked me
127:35 - okay and i'm going to go ahead and do it
127:38 - somebody said why is a capital um
127:40 - c so why is this freaking out uh one
127:43 - click equals oh yeah
127:44 - so we haven't actually added the
127:45 - function they add a to do so you need to
127:47 - add that in there
127:49 - uh the reason why it's a capital c we
127:50 - call this camel casing
127:52 - um so it's actually um where you have
127:55 - the first word is is lowercase and it
127:57 - starts to
127:58 - it capitalizes after that and that the
128:01 - reason why it's actually
128:02 - very easy to um to read it when you have
128:06 - camel case
128:06 - stuff so it actually makes things a lot
128:08 - easier to read that's why we use common
128:09 - casings so i'm going to go here
128:11 - and now if i click this it says out she
128:13 - clicked me right
128:14 - and then you see it bubbles up so you
128:16 - can actually see over here it says eight
128:18 - so it goes ahead and it makes it a lot
128:20 - easier to um
128:22 - to uh to go ahead and work with that
128:25 - um okay so now what we're going to do is
128:28 - we're going to go ahead and when we do
128:30 - this i instead of just
128:32 - saying out you clicked me i want to add
128:34 - whatever's written inside of
128:36 - this to like inside of here say if i've
128:38 - got hello right in here
128:39 - right i want to say i want to basically
128:42 - add that to my to-do list
128:44 - right so the way we do that is a lot
128:45 - simpler than you think
128:47 - we just say set to do's right and then
128:50 - here
128:51 - we set it to whatever we want so this is
128:53 - eventually we'll have the entire race
128:54 - it'll be like abc
128:56 - we'll be like take dogs out for a walk
128:57 - take dogs for a walk
129:00 - right but we want it to be dynamic we
129:02 - don't want to have to hard code this
129:03 - stuff in here
129:04 - okay so now what i'm going to do is
129:06 - inside of here
129:08 - this is a trick and this is called
129:09 - something called spread operator
129:11 - okay so here i'm saying set the to-do's
129:13 - to an array
129:15 - but i want to keep everything so this is
129:18 - basically this is called a spread so i
129:19 - want to keep everything that's currently
129:21 - in the array so right now i guess it
129:22 - would be empty
129:23 - but if it had some stuff inside of this
129:25 - array so an array if you don't know what
129:27 - an array is it's just a list
129:29 - right it's just a list um and bala
129:32 - elias on on facebook says can anybody
129:34 - join you guys on zoom you have to be
129:36 - inside a profit or javascript to join in
129:37 - the zoom
129:38 - link will be in the description just go
129:39 - ahead and check that out if you're
129:40 - interested
129:41 - oh yeah so um cons add a to do
129:44 - and then here guys we're going to say
129:46 - this is called a spread and basically
129:47 - imagine that you have a list of things
129:49 - right so you had like
129:51 - um task a task b
129:56 - task c etc right oh task c
130:00 - so like this now when you spread it
130:03 - you're basically saying like spread out
130:04 - the values inside of here so then this
130:06 - would then become like
130:08 - task a task b plus c right like this and
130:11 - you'd get the this of you're spreading
130:12 - it out
130:13 - so that's what i mean when i do that and
130:15 - you can't just go ahead and do like
130:17 - to-do's because that will have like an
130:18 - array inside of an array so we don't
130:20 - want to do that
130:21 - you spread out your this and then what
130:23 - we do is we say input text
130:24 - because i'm actually going to whatever
130:26 - i've typed in here i want to basically
130:28 - i'm just pushing that into the array
130:30 - so now if the if the list looked like
130:32 - this before
130:34 - and then i add a fourth one it will go
130:36 - ahead and add it so now to test this
130:38 - what we can do is we can rather than
130:39 - having saying out you clicked me we can
130:41 - say out you clicked me
130:43 - comma and i want to say actually we can
130:46 - say uh
130:47 - this is the to-do's uh list
130:52 - all right and then what i'm going to do
130:53 - is i'm going to copy this and i'm going
130:55 - to go ahead
130:56 - and paste it here so this is the to-do's
130:58 - list right
130:59 - so now what should happen is i want to
131:02 - get i'm going to change the state to be
131:04 - blank in the beginning as well
131:06 - so now what should happen is if i go
131:08 - back and if i go ahead and say like
131:10 - take dogs for a walk
131:13 - when i hit this added to do um
131:17 - i can see that now that basically it
131:19 - goes ahead and
131:20 - it it adds to the to-do's and then it
131:23 - will add
131:24 - the input text so it should add this to
131:26 - the list and we should see this is the
131:27 - to-do's list with that list
131:29 - so boom this is the two let's take dogs
131:31 - for a walk
131:33 - right now if i get rid of this text and
131:35 - i say like okay
131:36 - take trash out right
131:40 - then i can go ahead and say boom and
131:42 - then now you've got two things in the to
131:43 - do let's take dogs for a walk and take
131:45 - trash out
131:46 - all right so
131:50 - so now what we can say is we've got two
131:52 - things into this but notice there's a
131:54 - few
131:54 - ui problems here right so like every
131:57 - time i type in a task right like paint
132:00 - the walls right and i click add to do
132:03 - so it does it but i want this kind of
132:04 - clear right so in order to clear this
132:06 - what we can do is after we set the to
132:08 - do's we can set the input text
132:10 - to be blank again and this will actually
132:13 - go ahead and fix that issue
132:14 - so we can go ahead and do that now we
132:15 - can test it we can go back and we can
132:16 - say
132:17 - okay take dogs out added to do
132:20 - okay so you see it clearly again that's
132:22 - that's a lot cleaner of an experience
132:24 - right
132:24 - the second one we can do is we can say
132:25 - like paint walls so let's go ahead and
132:27 - say paint walls paint walls
132:29 - oops paint walls and then added to do
132:32 - boom
132:32 - now we've got two things in the list and
132:34 - we've cleared the twos so now we have
132:36 - something to render on the screen
132:38 - all right so now we have a list of
132:39 - to-do's and we can programmatically sort
132:41 - of render that on the screen now we can
132:42 - actually show that on the screen
132:44 - so what i'm going to do now is is to do
132:46 - that we're going to use something called
132:47 - a map
132:48 - and a map is an es6 function all the map
132:51 - does
132:51 - is you have two things which some people
132:53 - get confused about for each versus a map
132:55 - a map is essentially just going to
132:57 - loop through it's just going to loop
133:00 - through the
133:00 - the array so this this list right here
133:02 - where it says take dogs out for a walk
133:04 - and paint the walls
133:05 - it's going to loop through that and we
133:06 - can return some information from it
133:09 - in a for each loop you can't return okay
133:11 - so here what we do is we have these
133:12 - curly brackets inside our return
133:14 - this allows us to run javascript inside
133:16 - of that html block
133:18 - and we're going to go ahead and say
133:20 - to-do's which is our variable we're
133:21 - going to say map
133:23 - and then basically it gives you like
133:24 - this it's called a callback and what we
133:26 - say here is like
133:27 - for every time we loop through it so
133:29 - what the first time it loops through it
133:30 - it's going to get take dogs out the
133:32 - second time it loops through it's going
133:33 - to get paint walls
133:34 - so what do we call each time like every
133:36 - time it grabs it what do we call that
133:37 - and in this case we're just going to
133:38 - call it a single to-do
133:40 - okay and then what i say is an arrow and
133:43 - then i use a parenthesis
133:44 - and this means that we're going to
133:45 - directly return something so here what
133:48 - i'm going to say
133:49 - is return a h2 tag and i'm just going to
133:53 - literally
133:54 - remember i'm using the the javascript
133:56 - curly braces again here
133:58 - and i've got the to do so this should
134:00 - now map through it
134:01 - and it should show h2 tags as i add them
134:04 - so if we save it now
134:05 - so if i go ahead and say like take dogs
134:08 - for
134:08 - a walk and add to do boom take those for
134:11 - a walk
134:13 - i go paint the walls
134:16 - either to do boom works all right so
134:19 - that's really cool
134:20 - this is asking for unique key props i'm
134:22 - not going to talk about what keys are
134:23 - right now
134:24 - um atharva says to do prepare for
134:27 - sonny's birthday thank you dude
134:29 - um thank me later nice
134:32 - um yeah so you can see now we've
134:33 - actually got like some state and you see
134:35 - we use state for two purposes here we
134:37 - used it to keep track of the to do's
134:39 - and we use this to take track of um
134:42 - the uh to keep track of the uh input
134:45 - text
134:46 - right so that's state is very powerful
134:48 - right
134:49 - now what we're going to do is i want i
134:50 - mean this doesn't look that good right
134:51 - like really i mean it looks kind of
134:52 - boring and also before we do that i
134:54 - actually want to
134:55 - improve this experience and say like hey
134:58 - hello world and if i hit so now if i hit
135:00 - the enter key nothing's happening
135:02 - right so nothing's happening when i hit
135:04 - the enter key but that's kind of what we
135:06 - want to happen right so
135:08 - i'm going to teach you guys a little
135:09 - trick so inside of here's our input and
135:12 - here's the button
135:13 - so what you want to do is to get it so
135:15 - that when you hit the enter key
135:16 - it submits and it basically presses
135:19 - adder to do for you
135:20 - what you need to do is you go here and
135:23 - you wrap
135:24 - you wrap the entire thing in a form so
135:27 - you just want to have form
135:28 - and you go ahead and grab your your
135:30 - input and your button put it here
135:32 - save it okay that's good and then inside
135:35 - of the button
135:36 - we add something called type and this
135:38 - type will have submit
135:40 - okay now we have to do some an
135:42 - additional step now so if i save it
135:44 - look what happens if i say like take
135:46 - dogs out and
135:47 - as soon as i do this now watch what
135:50 - happens so
135:50 - if i hit enter it added it but then it
135:53 - refreshed
135:54 - right which is really annoying because
135:56 - like it refreshed and we lost everything
135:57 - because the state doesn't keep track
135:59 - when we refresh
136:00 - now what we want to do is instead we go
136:03 - to added to do
136:05 - and now how did you do everything in in
136:07 - sort of javascript
136:08 - whenever you sort of interact with the
136:09 - html elements like when we click this
136:12 - button for example
136:13 - it fires off an event right they always
136:15 - fire off an event
136:16 - and in this case what we're doing is
136:17 - we're saying event dot prevent
136:19 - default and what this is saying is like
136:21 - don't refresh
136:23 - okay so it's just saying like don't
136:25 - refresh okay so now what we can say
136:27 - is take dogs out for a walk
136:30 - and i hit enter i just do doom works
136:33 - okay so you get this nice user
136:36 - experience now this
136:37 - is the subtle things like this that make
136:39 - the whole user experience easier
136:41 - um and it makes you like it makes like
136:44 - you saw in the beginning like who the
136:45 - hell
136:45 - sort of types in something and adds it
136:48 - adds
136:48 - to you and it just kind of breaks it
136:50 - right but look what happens if i go
136:52 - ahead and
136:52 - keep clicking added to do so that's not
136:55 - good
136:56 - right so in here we've got all these
136:57 - empty strings
136:59 - so another tip you can do is the button
137:02 - itself
137:03 - what you can go ahead and say is you can
137:04 - say this disable the button
137:07 - if there is no so use exclamation mark
137:10 - to say
137:10 - like if there is no for example if it's
137:13 - like first you can say if there is no
137:14 - input text
137:15 - disable the button so now if i do that
137:18 - you can see it's grayed out
137:20 - right but as soon as i type in it allows
137:23 - me and that also stops me from hitting
137:25 - the enter key
137:26 - right so now so sachin sharma says
137:30 - uh when we hit enter it runs an event
137:32 - that's why it refreshes the page right
137:34 - so no it's not it's not that it runs an
137:35 - event it's that the default behavior of
137:38 - that event
137:39 - is to submit a form because now it's
137:41 - inside of a form
137:42 - and back in the day when you used php
137:44 - and stuff like that you would submit the
137:46 - form it would like go ahead grab some
137:48 - stuff and it would come back and then
137:50 - it would redirect you to a page but we
137:51 - don't redirect anymore inside of
137:54 - inside of javascript and react that
137:55 - react is all about being reactive we
137:57 - hate redirecting
137:58 - because it's a crappy user experience we
138:00 - want it all to be like snappy fast
138:02 - right so here now what we say is testing
138:06 - enter boom it works right abc right it
138:08 - all
138:09 - works really nice so that's part one
138:11 - done
138:12 - so we pretty much just conquered state
138:14 - so if you guys
138:15 - somewhat followed along with me just uh
138:18 - what i want to say is
138:19 - raise your hand so i get a kind of like
138:21 - if you guys kind of understand the state
138:23 - a little bit more now just raise your
138:25 - hand
138:25 - right it's completely fine as well if if
138:28 - it's a bit confusing still
138:29 - like remember this is a it's a journey
138:31 - so it doesn't matter if it doesn't make
138:32 - sense now it will make sense
138:34 - soon so awesome stuff glad to see uh
138:37 - that it helped a lot of you understand
138:38 - state a bit okay
138:40 - nice um so let's go ahead and go back
138:43 - so now what we're gonna do guys is we're
138:46 - gonna go ahead and we're gonna make the
138:47 - best of
138:48 - props okay so um
138:52 - so pedro says i have a question about
138:53 - state shoot dude go for it
138:56 - uh i'm not um yeah
139:00 - yes you want yeah okay
139:05 - hey can you hear me yep uh i can help
139:07 - you
139:08 - so when i start i when i learn react i
139:10 - was using class-based components
139:12 - and you know when you create a state um
139:15 - for example you could create like an
139:16 - object
139:17 - inside the states with properties and
139:19 - sides
139:20 - can you also do that with the hooks in
139:22 - the states yeah so very good question
139:24 - yeah so
139:25 - um a lot of people whether you've coded
139:28 - in react before
139:29 - whether or not you've coded um or
139:31 - whether or not you've just seen a
139:32 - class-based component i'm going to show
139:34 - you the exact same code
139:36 - so before we move on i'll show you this
139:37 - exact same code in a class based
139:39 - component right
139:40 - so well somewhat close to it right and
139:43 - then we'll get we'll kind of get like a
139:44 - similar thing
139:45 - so in react this is called a functional
139:48 - component now you might see it like this
139:49 - as well
139:50 - in some cases this is called an es6
139:52 - arrow function functional component but
139:54 - in this case uh we can do it this way
139:58 - um but basically what we can do is i'm
139:59 - just going to create another folder
140:01 - a file called app and i'll just call
140:03 - this one underscore class right just
140:05 - js and this is i don't know does anyone
140:07 - know if there's a snippet for that i
140:09 - think it's rf
140:10 - uh react is it rrc
140:13 - yeah there we go so this is what you
140:15 - might have seen before
140:16 - right so this is called a class based
140:17 - component now guys already
140:20 - this is much nicer than this this is
140:22 - kind of freaking out it's like okay
140:23 - export default class
140:25 - um but let's make it a bit simple for
140:27 - you guys let's go ahead and do this
140:28 - export default
140:30 - let's just do it let's keep it somewhat
140:32 - consistent okay there we go
140:34 - so now in class-based components you
140:37 - have a class which represents the
140:38 - component so in this case
140:39 - this is the app component and this is
140:42 - the same app component but it's using
140:43 - class-based components
140:45 - okay um but what's really
140:49 - annoying about this is that you have
140:50 - this render function which then returns
140:53 - the html right now inside the render is
140:55 - where we can do a lot of sort of our
140:56 - coding and stuff like that
140:57 - but in order to use state inside of here
141:00 - you have to do the following right you
141:02 - have to actually go ahead and say a
141:03 - constructor
141:04 - and then this takes something called
141:05 - props and you have to go ahead and say
141:07 - super props
141:09 - yeah which everyone kind of still to
141:11 - this day is a bit confused about like
141:12 - what the hell does this mean
141:14 - like it gets very confusing right and
141:16 - then you also have something called this
141:18 - dot state right and this is the initial
141:20 - state of what it looks like so
141:22 - in the case before we had input text
141:25 - right so we had in here we would put
141:27 - input text and this is how it would look
141:30 - now when we had that code that we had
141:32 - previously so let's go ahead and copy
141:33 - the code in
141:34 - like this and we also had to do's and
141:37 - notice how they merge it all into like
141:39 - one
141:40 - block here right which you might think
141:42 - is good but trust me
141:43 - there are issues to this right um
141:48 - right so but there are issues to this as
141:50 - well so we're gonna go here and i'm
141:51 - gonna go ahead and copy this in and boom
141:53 - there we go
141:54 - now in order to do this the on change we
141:56 - can't no longer say set input text it
141:58 - doesn't work that way
141:59 - we actually go after we have to put some
142:01 - code here and we actually need to say
142:03 - this
142:03 - dot set state and then you pass this set
142:07 - state and object
142:08 - and then you actually go ahead and say
142:09 - input text is
142:11 - event dot target dot
142:14 - um value right so
142:18 - you can see now like that this is the
142:19 - sort of subtle differences
142:21 - as i mean like you can see already this
142:23 - is like a kind of nasty piece of code
142:25 - right
142:25 - whereas this is just very simple like
142:27 - and the good thing about this is every
142:29 - single piece of
142:30 - state has its own modifier so the input
142:34 - text has set input text
142:35 - the to-do's are set to do is very clean
142:38 - whereas with this it's like this dot set
142:40 - state you pass an object in and then you
142:42 - do it like this
142:42 - it's kind of messy right it's kind of
142:44 - messy and also
142:47 - this this the keyword this gets thrown
142:49 - around everywhere
142:50 - and you kind of get confused as to when
142:52 - and where you should use it and it will
142:54 - throw you off and kind of get it
142:55 - annoying right
142:56 - so uh my opinion is i mean i don't know
143:00 - was that did that answer your question
143:02 - uh was it was that
143:03 - one uh i was i was asking like if if i
143:05 - want to put
143:06 - like an object in the states do i have
143:07 - to create a variable for each
143:09 - inputs or can i can i create an object
143:12 - for the same variable
143:13 - with many uh properties inside like
143:16 - could i create
143:18 - one on the functional component could i
143:19 - create a
143:21 - consts uh whatever name object and then
143:24 - create some variables inside that object
143:26 - or
143:26 - that do i have to create individual ones
143:28 - for each um
143:30 - so you can have like an array of objects
143:34 - right could i could i set inputs in
143:36 - there
143:37 - yeah yeah so when you set the to-do's
143:39 - you can actually set that to anything
143:41 - you want
143:41 - like uh inside of here um this is
143:43 - basically just a modifier it's called a
143:45 - setter function which means that
143:47 - basically if i put this as like abc i'll
143:49 - change it to abc if i put this as an
143:51 - object it will change it to an object
143:53 - um you can definitely go ahead and do
143:55 - that yeah
143:56 - okay cool perfect yeah nice so i'm going
144:00 - to go ahead and
144:01 - now you're welcome dude so i would say
144:02 - right now you can see that
144:04 - class-based components and what we will
144:06 - do is one day i'll show you an entire
144:07 - session just about
144:08 - pretty much refactoring class-based and
144:10 - life-cycle methods and everything like
144:11 - that
144:12 - to um two functional components because
144:15 - i think that would be very handy but in
144:17 - today's one
144:18 - i just thought it would be a handy thing
144:19 - to show you and but you can see that a
144:21 - functional based component is very
144:22 - simple
144:22 - compared it's very nice we have hooks
144:24 - now which allows the code to be a lot
144:25 - simpler
144:26 - and um yeah that that sort of stuff okay
144:29 - so now
144:30 - we have the other to do so the final
144:32 - thing before we sort of
144:33 - uh wrap up and do a q a is going to be
144:35 - pretty much a prop right so prop in this
144:37 - case is going to be the to do component
144:39 - so i'm going to show you guys we're
144:40 - going to create a to do.js
144:42 - this is going to represent the to-do's
144:44 - component now in here that little
144:46 - snippet extension that we installed
144:48 - earlier if we do rfce
144:50 - right uh boom it gives me a functional
144:54 - component
144:54 - so that's really nice and even has the
144:56 - correct file name
144:57 - so it's very very nice to do that it's
144:59 - very simple and what i'm going to do is
145:01 - i'm going to go ahead and pop this on
145:02 - the side
145:03 - so we have our to do underneath actually
145:06 - so like this we have the to do and then
145:08 - we have our app.js code up here so
145:10 - i don't know if that's confusing but i
145:11 - think i think it's pretty clear like we
145:12 - have the code up here
145:14 - and so this is our app.js is where we
145:16 - were mapping out the the stuff before
145:19 - and this is where we have our stuff
145:22 - right now okay so um
145:24 - so this is the two component and instead
145:26 - now what we do is
145:27 - here we can say render the to do
145:30 - component that we just created
145:32 - okay now i can do a smart import so i
145:34 - can go ahead and
145:36 - import that you just say import to do
145:37 - from our local file which is dot
145:41 - dot forward slash to do and then
145:44 - um also yeah dm patch guys if you're
145:47 - interested so if you want to chat with
145:48 - them slack or instagram
145:49 - more patch please go ahead and message
145:51 - him about what we spoke about earlier
145:53 - that would be really really handy i
145:54 - think
145:55 - patch just created a new uh instagram
145:57 - for
145:58 - coding okay oh awesome
146:01 - that's really awesome that's cool yeah
146:02 - so go ahead and reach out to him and
146:04 - that will be
146:04 - uh and he'll be able to help you out so
146:08 - now we have the to-do sorry sammy uh i
146:11 - have a question
146:12 - yeah uh actually uh
146:15 - what pedro asked like uh that was a good
146:17 - question but
146:18 - i have like more question on that like
146:21 - can you make like
146:22 - some application like based on class so
146:25 - we'll be having
146:26 - an idea like what is the difference and
146:28 - how complicated the class based
146:30 - when compared to functional based yeah
146:32 - so what i'll do
146:34 - what i'll do for a session uh maybe we
146:36 - can do it the next time is i will
146:38 - uh code up uh an example like a really
146:40 - nice to do app or something in a
146:42 - class-based fashion
146:43 - and i'll show you like let's assume it
146:45 - will i present in like a job approach
146:47 - right so like somebody comes up to you
146:48 - and says here's my class-based component
146:50 - and my car space app i need to refactor
146:53 - all the code so it's functional
146:54 - components
146:55 - right and then i'll show you guys how to
146:57 - go ahead and transform the entire code
146:59 - base to
147:00 - functional right it's actually a lot
147:01 - simpler than you think so it's a lot
147:03 - but remember just dm me um or message
147:06 - amino
147:08 - and we'll keep track of that but that's
147:09 - a good that's good question yeah
147:12 - thank you so much tim so now what we do
147:14 - is we render a to-do right now what
147:15 - we're going to say is i'm going to add a
147:16 - h2 and just say this is a to-do this is
147:18 - a to-do
147:19 - like so right now what we should see is
147:21 - if i do abc
147:23 - or like take dogs out take dogs out take
147:26 - dogs
147:26 - out and as you see it says take dogs out
147:29 - but oh no i didn't save the file sorry i
147:31 - didn't save the file
147:32 - if i do take dogs out
147:35 - this is it to do so it doesn't say take
147:37 - dogs out right if i do it again
147:39 - paint walls okay i mean
147:42 - they're kind of work but it doesn't say
147:44 - the actual to-do right like this is this
147:46 - isn't what we want
147:47 - so in a functional component what we can
147:50 - do is inside where we actually have that
147:52 - where it says function to do
147:53 - here you can you pass in something
147:55 - called props okay
147:57 - now props the way we see props is
148:00 - is the way we write a prop is here where
148:02 - we have the to-do we can actually just
148:03 - say the text
148:05 - of the to-do in this case is the to-do
148:07 - itself so like this to do
148:09 - we're going to pass that in and that
148:11 - comes through here and what we can do is
148:13 - we can actually use it
148:14 - so we can go ahead and say um the prop
148:18 - like props dot text
148:19 - right so it's basically going to that
148:21 - text and it's finding it and it's using
148:23 - it here so basically that passing it
148:24 - through it's like threading a needle
148:26 - all right and now if i say take dogs out
148:29 - for walk now it comes through
148:32 - if i say abc now it comes through right
148:35 - one two three
148:36 - comes through okay so that's how we do
148:37 - it and now we can use something called
148:39 - es6 destructuring
148:40 - to go ahead and we can break apart this
148:42 - object here and we can say like go ahead
148:44 - and get me the text directly
148:46 - and that is why sometimes you'll see in
148:48 - code it's written like this
148:50 - because that kind of breaks apart but i
148:52 - don't want to confuse anyone at this
148:53 - point i'll keep it as prop start text
148:55 - okay because
148:56 - destructuring i remember when i first
148:57 - saw it was a bit confusing and it kind
148:59 - of threw me off so
149:00 - um so so in this case it's very clear to
149:03 - see where we're getting it from okay
149:05 - so now we've got this which is really
149:06 - nice and the reason why this is nice
149:08 - is because what i'm going to do now is
149:09 - i'm going to create a css file
149:11 - specifically for the styling of it to do
149:13 - okay so to do.css and what i'm going to
149:16 - do is i'm going to go ahead and create
149:18 - that file because that's why it's
149:19 - freaking out so to do.css
149:21 - and you can see now it's all good and
149:23 - now what we can say is
149:24 - here i'm going to give it a class name
149:26 - also in react you don't use classes use
149:28 - classname
149:30 - because we have class-based components
149:32 - which is why class is a reserved word
149:34 - and here i'm going to say to do right
149:36 - and then what we can do is we can
149:38 - actually go ahead and start this now so
149:39 - if i go ahead and say take dogs out
149:41 - and and let's go ahead and say like uh
149:43 - painting the walls
149:46 - right now um let's go ahead and style it
149:49 - okay so i'm going to open up my
149:50 - to-do.css
149:51 - and here i'm going to target the to-do
149:53 - class so here is the class name to do
149:56 - i'm going to go and target it and that's
149:57 - how you target a class name
149:59 - i'm going to go ahead and say right
150:01 - board give it a border
150:03 - of one pixel solid red because i just
150:05 - want it to be super exaggerated so now
150:07 - you can see
150:08 - each of the components have got the same
150:10 - styling because it's the same component
150:12 - we're just reusing it
150:13 - right go ahead and give it some padding
150:15 - so let's give it some padding
150:16 - 10 pixels okay that looks pretty good
150:19 - now notice how padding
150:21 - um padding adds space inside the
150:24 - component
150:25 - and a margin adds space outside the
150:28 - component so it's going to space it
150:29 - around so if i do margin 10 pixels
150:31 - boom that gives it space outside okay so
150:34 - you see it starts to look really clean
150:35 - right and then we go and we can
150:37 - go and add something and so like we'll
150:38 - say um
150:40 - go have a fancy dinner
150:43 - boom and then it says it comes in the
150:45 - bottom so go have a fancy dinner
150:47 - and then this is going to say like uh
150:49 - run a tutorial
150:52 - there we go so it comes in right so
150:54 - that's really clean
150:55 - um what we can also do is say you want
150:58 - it to pop up at the top
151:00 - very quick fix for that is rather than
151:02 - having the spread at the front you can
151:03 - go ahead and actually
151:05 - um add the input text to the front like
151:08 - that
151:09 - and here you can do like take dogs out
151:13 - paint the walls
151:16 - um hello world and you see it pops at
151:19 - the front now
151:20 - right and then it spreads it out
151:22 - afterwards so that's that's kind of that
151:24 - might be nicer
151:25 - for the ui your experience so now you
151:28 - can pretty much
151:29 - go ahead and see that we have a
151:31 - component
151:32 - here to do component and whatever we
151:34 - start with that component
151:36 - and the benefit here guys is that this
151:38 - is going to be really valuable because
151:40 - this is
151:40 - this is so easy to maintain now so you
151:43 - can actually have somebody working
151:44 - entirely on the
151:45 - to the to-do component and you can just
151:48 - say like hey if you just
151:50 - just tell me if you change the props and
151:52 - now you can have somebody working on
151:54 - this component styling it making it look
151:56 - absolutely stunning and then somebody
151:58 - else can be focusing on this stuff and
152:00 - working on all of this and
152:01 - you know that with confidence you're not
152:03 - gonna
152:04 - have too much of a problem integrating
152:06 - your code right and i'll teach you how
152:08 - to use github in a different session and
152:10 - i will also be introducing modules on
152:12 - source control and things like that
152:13 - um so there you go there we have it like
152:16 - and what i want
152:17 - you guys as homework is basically go
152:19 - ahead and get to this point
152:22 - but style it make it look really nice
152:23 - right now this looks so ugly right
152:26 - so there's a challenge and obviously if
152:27 - you've used any of the um
152:29 - if you've done any of the youtube cones
152:31 - that we've had on on youtube
152:33 - you'll know that we actually do a lot of
152:34 - material ui work
152:36 - so material ui is something uh provided
152:39 - by google it's
152:39 - like a design library and this is
152:42 - how you can use it it has very clear
152:44 - installation instructions it has
152:46 - an icon library so if you go ahead and
152:48 - type in icons
152:49 - you get a bunch of icons over here as
152:51 - well and it shows you how to install it
152:53 - but this is really cool because this you
152:55 - can use this like to to add in like
152:57 - these really nice
152:58 - input fields um so i would say like go
153:01 - ahead and play this play with this a bit
153:02 - if you guys want um
153:04 - so i'm gonna go ahead and just show you
153:05 - guys maybe an input i don't know if
153:06 - they've got an example but
153:08 - yeah i've used the input fill before but
153:09 - like a material ui is very very clean it
153:12 - looks really really good
153:13 - it looks really really nice so if i go
153:14 - to components maybe you can see some
153:16 - examples so the buttons for example
153:19 - they you see they've got that ripple
153:20 - effect very nice googly
153:22 - sort of ripple effect right um and
153:25 - that's something where like it's very
153:26 - easy and you can see like all you do is
153:28 - you actually blast a prop
153:29 - pass a prop in and then they have
153:31 - different styles they still support the
153:33 - disabled
153:34 - states so you see they actually still
153:35 - take disabled as props and what
153:38 - these design libraries do is they
153:40 - basically just you see the only
153:41 - difference is there's a capital b
153:43 - and you would have to import it okay so
153:45 - you'd import it like import button from
153:47 - material
153:48 - ui and you would install it and stuff
153:50 - like that and that's why you would use
153:51 - that so for homework guys i want you
153:53 - guys to go ahead
153:54 - um and do that and then pretty much go
153:56 - ahead and share that on the community
153:58 - and share that inside the slack channel
154:00 - inside the coaching call next time if
154:01 - anyone has any questions it'll be a good
154:03 - time to bring it up and say like hey i
154:04 - got stuck on this state i got stuck on
154:06 - this prop
154:06 - stuff like what's going on with that um
154:09 - but yeah like that's going to be like
154:11 - your main sort of like we said like
154:13 - html css javascript really know the
154:15 - fundamentals of stuff right really right
154:17 - now that because that's going to be like
154:18 - your building blocks in the beginning
154:19 - then react is going to be like the main
154:21 - two things that we talked about right
154:22 - now which are very very important
154:24 - are going to be um let's go ahead and
154:27 - just do
154:30 - two things uh two super
154:33 - important react things okay
154:37 - i like to keep it very simple one state
154:41 - two props that's it guys right
154:44 - if you if you master these two things or
154:46 - you get very good at these two things
154:47 - everything else kind of like
154:48 - what i want you to do is like we then
154:50 - layer it right we then add in things
154:52 - like react
154:52 - redux and and react context api and all
154:55 - that other stuff but these two things
154:56 - like you can build a really powerful app
154:58 - just knowing these two things
154:59 - like we built a to-do app today and sure
155:01 - it didn't look that like it doesn't look
155:02 - that great but
155:03 - the main thing is like with a bit of css
155:05 - and a bit of like a lick of paint
155:07 - like if i quickly go ahead and do like
155:08 - app text align center for example
155:11 - like then you know everything kind of
155:12 - comes in line in the center like it
155:14 - doesn't take a lot of styling to go
155:15 - ahead and get a very
155:16 - i wouldn't do this by the way i wouldn't
155:18 - actually recommend i'd focus more on
155:20 - targeting things like at a more
155:22 - individual level but like say if you
155:24 - want to target the h1 you could go ahead
155:26 - and say like
155:27 - rather than giving it a um an exact
155:30 - thing you say
155:30 - get the h1 you can say like margin um
155:34 - let's give it like a 20 pixel margin to
155:35 - space it out a little bit more you can
155:37 - see like things start to very quickly
155:38 - come together
155:40 - um and that and that starts to look very
155:42 - clean
155:43 - so i want you guys to go ahead style
155:45 - that take that into your own hands make
155:46 - it start look you know make
155:47 - take some pride with that and like even
155:49 - maybe implement flexbox if you guys want
155:51 - and kind of mess around with that
155:52 - um but the point is is that like the
155:54 - main purpose here was to teach you state
155:56 - and props
155:57 - because this is very important react
155:58 - stuff okay these are the two main things
156:01 - and honestly everything else is
156:02 - additional to this
156:03 - right so everything else is just an
156:04 - additional accessory but these two
156:06 - things are going to be like your
156:07 - fundamentals
156:08 - in react um okay so i think with that
156:12 - said
156:12 - well we're going to leave it there let's
156:14 - do q a right now right let's do a q a
156:16 - uh i'm gonna say go do some stretching
156:18 - after this question cause hell yeah
156:20 - need to go ahead and and uh and okay
156:22 - sony yeah
156:24 - uh thank you for everything i i was
156:26 - wondering
156:27 - uh we now this this thing is uh kind of
156:31 - small and once that we deploy it
156:35 - uh firebase will take care of all the
156:37 - information
156:38 - but now that we are doing it in the
156:41 - visual studio code
156:42 - where this information is stored um
156:46 - okay so this is all local right now
156:48 - right so there was
156:49 - so don't uh nothing to do with firebase
156:52 - was inside of today's build okay
156:54 - which means that like for example if i
156:57 - um
156:58 - i'm not showing the screen anymore but
156:59 - basically you you remember how when i
157:01 - refreshed right
157:02 - it disappeared right everything
157:04 - disappeared it's because
157:05 - react is non-persistent which means that
157:08 - state
157:09 - doesn't last which means if you refresh
157:11 - it disappears
157:12 - all right now i i you straight away the
157:14 - thing that's going to come to the top of
157:16 - your head is like oh
157:17 - hang on uh what's the point of that like
157:19 - if i can't see my to-do's every time i
157:21 - come back to the app
157:22 - but there are techniques you can do
157:23 - there's different techniques you can
157:24 - either
157:25 - use something like a cookie or local
157:27 - storage to do it or you can use
157:29 - something like firebase which
157:30 - actually stores inside of a database and
157:32 - then you can even go and do like a man
157:34 - stack build and have like a back end and
157:35 - things like that but
157:37 - you see it very quickly grows in sort of
157:39 - in terms of complexity what i want you
157:40 - guys to take from this is
157:42 - focus on building projects that are just
157:44 - functional right like yes it may
157:46 - not when you refresh it disappears but i
157:48 - mean it does the job
157:49 - in the beginning right like and then
157:50 - what i would want you to do is go ahead
157:52 - and use it as a challenge to upgrade it
157:56 - oh uh use it as a challenge
157:59 - um use it as a challenge for yourself
158:02 - to go ahead and um to go ahead and
158:05 - implement firebase when you learn it so
158:07 - every single project you guys do make
158:10 - sure
158:11 - you keep it because like i can't stress
158:14 - enough how many times you will go back
158:15 - to these projects
158:17 - right like you will constantly be going
158:18 - back to these projects checking them out
158:20 - and using them
158:21 - as your sort of uh you're sort of like
158:23 - going like
158:24 - when you go back to them as your sort of
158:26 - reference right when i was learning in
158:28 - the beginning it was
158:28 - very very important to like go back and
158:31 - sort of use like my sort of
158:33 - reference materials to make sure that
158:35 - everything was you know like um
158:37 - so if i forgot how to do like
158:38 - event.target.value for example
158:40 - to get the input text i would just go
158:42 - back and i remember i did that in that
158:44 - project
158:44 - and i'll pretty much go and check it out
158:46 - you know like that's going to be your
158:47 - your sort of revision material
158:49 - okay um yeah sonic i have a question too
158:53 - yeah uh how do you see the transition
158:56 - from react to react native
158:58 - and also do you feel as confident with
159:01 - react native as react and
159:02 - will you add more content in this sense
159:05 - for react native
159:07 - yeah so it's a good question so the
159:08 - transition from react to ragna
159:10 - put it this way my first job i had could
159:12 - him react before i never touched react
159:14 - native
159:15 - but i ended up coding a ton of like app
159:17 - features and making some like crazy
159:20 - implemented like it's crazy features
159:22 - inside of that app and that was all
159:24 - built on um react native so if you know
159:26 - react
159:27 - learning react native is is a breeze
159:29 - like is in you're pretty much
159:30 - it's very similar the crossover is very
159:33 - similar if you can code and react trust
159:34 - me you can call it react native
159:36 - um so that's why i'm saying things like
159:38 - state and props are so
159:40 - powerful because you learn that once
159:42 - master it once
159:44 - that can be used for a web app it can be
159:46 - used for an ios and android app
159:48 - or for react native like the power here
159:50 - is insane and then if you combine that
159:52 - with
159:52 - firebase you now have a full-fledged app
159:55 - which is
159:56 - super easy to build right and it can
159:58 - scale up it can scale down
160:00 - i'm sure you can do it with man you can
160:01 - do it with that sort of stuff but yeah
160:02 - that's my advice on that
160:04 - and do you plan on making more content
160:06 - with react i mean
160:08 - some content yeah react native in the
160:09 - future yeah for sure for sure so we're
160:11 - definitely going to be dropping some
160:12 - react native content
160:14 - um it's a case of right now like where
160:16 - we've been like super
160:18 - uh trying to drop as much value for you
160:20 - guys the builds and the clones and the
160:22 - challenge and everything like that
160:24 - um it takes a tremendous amount of work
160:25 - behind the scenes so even the prep and
160:27 - things like that take time that's why
160:29 - it may seem like there's periods of
160:31 - pausing also we want to take some down
160:33 - time
160:34 - to just improve the internals of the
160:36 - course to like add more
160:38 - you know more content for you guys and
160:39 - things like that but we will definitely
160:41 - be adding both
160:42 - we will always be adding to youtube we
160:44 - will always be adding to the course
160:46 - so yeah okay thank you awesome
160:49 - um let's go ahead and take questions so
160:51 - anyone uh feel free pedro
160:53 - yep go for it feel free to unmute
160:56 - yourself
160:57 - uh i'm not that yeah yep i'm just gonna
161:00 - change your settings so
161:01 - anyone can admit themselves okay awesome
161:04 - okay
161:05 - oh hi uh so i just have a quick question
161:07 - about the the map the dot map function
161:09 - yep um because you mentioned it before
161:11 - early and i've used it many times and he
161:12 - always complains that he asks for a key
161:14 - okay um and i've tried to use the the
161:17 - array length
161:18 - but he it i i heard that it was not
161:21 - recommended
161:22 - yeah what other way would be the best
161:24 - way to use that
161:25 - yeah so very good question so you know
161:26 - guys when we
161:28 - rendered out the uh the oh you muted
161:30 - sonny uh
161:31 - okay oh there we go there you go yeah
161:34 - yeah
161:35 - so um goddammit i'm not joking this is
161:38 - so good
161:39 - yeah so when we rendered out the to-do
161:41 - list all right it said like it freaked
161:43 - out about a key right so
161:45 - what key is inside of react is when you
161:47 - have a list of things and you try and
161:48 - render it out
161:49 - react basically it's very clever because
161:52 - it only re-renders
161:53 - like when we added elements to the list
161:55 - it only added what it only re-rendered
161:58 - what it needed to re-render on the
161:59 - screen but if we
162:01 - a key is basically you know we had like
162:03 - three different to-do lists
162:05 - to do components when we added three
162:06 - items to the to the to-do list right
162:09 - um a key is going to be something unique
162:12 - to identify that component
162:14 - so that you so that react knows that
162:16 - this component is not the same as this
162:18 - other component
162:20 - right so and the reason why it needs
162:22 - that is because for example when we add
162:24 - something to that list
162:26 - it then allows react to carefully
162:28 - basically only re-render
162:30 - that one row basically in the to-do list
162:34 - right
162:34 - whereas imagine if we've got like a
162:36 - thousand records in a to-do list if you
162:38 - have no keys
162:39 - and i add something to the to the to-do
162:41 - list the react is going to re-render the
162:43 - entire list
162:45 - right it's going to re-render the entire
162:46 - if you add keys in
162:48 - it won't re-render the 1000 elements in
162:50 - there it will only
162:51 - render in the 1001 element that you just
162:54 - added
162:55 - right so the key value that's why if you
162:58 - use array.length everything has the same
163:00 - key
163:01 - right which means that it's kind of
163:02 - confusing react it's like oh they're
163:04 - you're saying that they're all the same
163:05 - components right so in this case
163:08 - you could use input text but it's very
163:09 - bad because if you have two of the same
163:11 - to-do's
163:12 - uh it's not going to work very well uh
163:14 - timestamp is something that people use
163:16 - um but you're go you will also have a
163:18 - you can also have a clash
163:20 - because imagine you had a huge app and
163:22 - two people
163:23 - for somehow sent the exact same message
163:25 - at the exact same time
163:27 - you're gonna get a little cash but it's
163:28 - a very small clash um but
163:30 - what what i would say is the best answer
163:32 - to this is using a unique id so there is
163:34 - a library called
163:35 - uuid um and you can use that
163:39 - and when you use firebase they actually
163:41 - handle ids for you
163:42 - so they handle id generation for you so
163:45 - in in
163:46 - either check out the clones that's going
163:48 - to be kind of a handy one and also in in
163:50 - a future build when we sort of go
163:51 - through firebase i can show you guys
163:52 - how you can use their ids um but yeah
163:55 - you want to make sure you use
163:57 - the uuid is a very good library to use
164:00 - because you can actually it will
164:01 - randomly generate a string
164:03 - that's only going to be for that that
164:06 - that component
164:07 - right so that's going to be that's a
164:08 - very very good question actually yeah
164:10 - yeah because i was working in a project
164:11 - that i was getting like an array of like
164:13 - 80 objects and i couldn't i couldn't
164:16 - render properly because i keep getting
164:18 - that error
164:19 - that didn't have an id and i tried to
164:20 - use the the array.length but it was
164:22 - still doing the same thing
164:23 - yeah so so now do you understand why the
164:25 - array.length is
164:27 - isn't good yeah yeah perfectly
164:35 - hi i actually followed all your clones
164:38 - uh
164:38 - uh like built all your clones as of now
164:41 - everything and
164:42 - yeah and every week i uh attend at least
164:45 - two to three uh interviews oh nice
164:48 - interview
164:48 - it went until i had an interview with
164:50 - the director of some australian company
164:53 - yeah okay so they asked like like i lost
164:56 - my job due to
164:57 - uh covet i was a data scientist okay
165:00 - so i'm new to web development so they're
165:03 - asking
165:04 - um okay like you work with data science
165:07 - and now why do you want to switch to
165:09 - uh web development as a react developer
165:12 - so they are like it's two different path
165:14 - competitive programming
165:15 - uh or web development so um like they're
165:18 - like it's two different streams which
165:20 - one should you
165:21 - choose go for so like
165:24 - what what is the call here like i really
165:26 - like web development
165:27 - yeah but there is a like data science
165:29 - has a whole different
165:31 - world in it so how do i like is there a
165:34 - common bridge
165:35 - like where i can bridge data science and
165:37 - web development
165:38 - yeah so um let's just so so the question
165:42 - here is pretty much um there's two
165:44 - separate areas there's there's
165:45 - uh data science uh and there's there's
165:47 - sort of web development right
165:49 - and and ruben's asking pretty much is
165:51 - there a bridge that can allow you to
165:53 - kind of do both or like
165:54 - or which one you should you choose in in
165:56 - some essence right
165:57 - correct right so what i would say to
166:00 - that is
166:01 - um is firstly identify
166:05 - which one you want to focus on right
166:08 - isn't so in my
166:08 - in this in my opinion data science is a
166:11 - lot of number crunching it's a lot of
166:12 - sort of
166:13 - breaking down a huge data set breaking
166:16 - like sort of going through data finding
166:17 - patterns inside the data which you can
166:19 - then
166:19 - use for example do people on amazon buy
166:23 - batteries with ipads or do they not
166:26 - right and if they do use that data to
166:29 - sell them
166:29 - a really expensive battery for example
166:31 - right that's like a data science example
166:33 - when you go to a shopping mall they move
166:35 - around everything based on data science
166:37 - like
166:37 - you can use data science on that sort of
166:38 - it's very sort of like logical
166:40 - uh it's like crunching numbers to to get
166:44 - to an answer right
166:45 - now web development is building
166:47 - something
166:48 - so you're building applications you're
166:49 - actually building something like a web
166:51 - like a
166:53 - a website or an application so i guess
166:56 - it's based on your goal
166:58 - is my is my answer to that so firstly
167:00 - identify which one you which you
167:01 - and i'll just say follow what you enjoy
167:03 - honestly follow what you enjoy yeah
167:05 - my honest opinion here would be web
167:07 - development is
167:08 - there's never been something so booming
167:10 - right now uh react is honestly on fire
167:12 - that when it comes to the job market so
167:13 - it's really really is something which is
167:15 - like oh it's taking off very
167:16 - crazy speed so i would recommend go
167:18 - ahead and do that
167:20 - um but what i would say is you can
167:21 - actually bridge it right you can bridge
167:23 - it
167:24 - and what i would recommend is looking
167:25 - into something called so if you're if
167:27 - you're interested in ai
167:29 - then look at something so you can do
167:31 - react you can do everything but then you
167:32 - can also use something called
167:34 - tensorflow.js
167:35 - which allows you to use something called
167:37 - machine like machine learning sort of
167:38 - networks and models
167:40 - you can actually pull that in in a very
167:41 - simple way into your app
167:44 - right okay tensorflow.js is one we
167:46 - actually have some videos on the channel
167:48 - but not about uh tensorflow but for
167:50 - example a python where we use we did it
167:53 - for like
167:54 - me and aaron did one on on on uh
167:56 - detecting faces and smiles
167:58 - right now using ai so that's something
168:00 - where you can do it um
168:02 - but you can do that and for example
168:03 - firebase allow you to they've got
168:04 - something called um
168:06 - ml kit which is like a machine learning
168:07 - kit for example you can do that
168:09 - also in javascript you can do
168:12 - on the back end so like on node.js you
168:14 - can do a lot of number crunching you can
168:15 - do a lot of data science stuff like that
168:17 - now will it be as optimal as like for
168:19 - example
168:20 - data science or number crunching in java
168:23 - or
168:23 - something like that maybe i mean maybe
168:26 - not like
168:27 - but what i would say is yes you can
168:29 - pursue both with javascript
168:32 - as possible so i should implement a data
168:34 - science or on the front end or
168:36 - in the back end like i don't understand
168:38 - where should i execute the data science
168:40 - part so always think of front end
168:42 - as like what the user is going to see
168:44 - all right so the front end is going to
168:45 - be what the user's going to see so
168:46 - front end would be like the website the
168:48 - sort of like the app itself
168:49 - so the data science bit would actually
168:51 - be on the back end it would make more
168:52 - sense to have it on the back end
168:54 - so for example if you went ahead and
168:55 - like on the front end you basically you
168:57 - you collected a bunch of details like
168:59 - what's your
169:00 - name age height and then you sent that
169:02 - over to the back end
169:03 - and then the back end did some crazy
169:04 - data science stuff which basically just
169:06 - crunched a bunch of numbers
169:07 - and then threw something back to the
169:09 - front end which says okay this is how
169:10 - tall you're going to be by the age of 25
169:13 - like you see what i mean like as in like
169:15 - that's how you would basically do it
169:16 - you'd have the front end where you would
169:17 - do the sort of user interaction and the
169:19 - back end would do the number crunching
169:21 - so is it possible with javascript or
169:23 - should i learn python for that
169:25 - no no so you can do um so javascript's
169:28 - really powerful because you have uh
169:30 - sort of javascript for the front end you
169:31 - have something called node.js for the
169:32 - back end
169:33 - um so if you learn javascript you can do
169:35 - front end and back in so you can do
169:37 - everything in in
169:38 - in javascript yes yeah but uh most of
169:41 - the
169:41 - stuff in data science is uh python used
169:44 - uh
169:44 - where like python is used for most of
169:46 - the applications yeah so you should
169:48 - you could do python i mean you can learn
169:50 - it but the problem is is like
169:52 - what i would say is that what you may
169:54 - end up doing is trying to delve into too
169:56 - many different things at once and not be
169:59 - not ever get good at one thing so what i
170:01 - would say is remember it's all about how
170:03 - much value you can provide to someone
170:05 - right
170:05 - so let's say you try and pick up like um
170:07 - if you fully dedicate to react
170:10 - you'll very soon become a like a react
170:12 - powerhouse and like you can
170:13 - like pretty much say i can build you
170:15 - this application i can do this stuff
170:16 - now what i would say is maybe like focus
170:18 - on one skill first
170:21 - and then know that okay like after i
170:23 - master that skill i get really good at
170:25 - it
170:25 - then i i know that i want to dive into
170:27 - data science as well
170:28 - so yes i can pick up python on the side
170:31 - or i can do it like afterwards
170:33 - and you can remember you can always have
170:35 - uh react on the front end
170:37 - python on the back end you can do that
170:39 - as in django
170:41 - on the back end so you can have giant
170:42 - like you can use like um i'm not that i
170:44 - think you've got it in python right
170:46 - um um yeah yes i think
170:49 - django i mean i haven't used django much
170:50 - but i think you but you can do is you
170:52 - can have react on the front end you can
170:53 - you definitely want you can run python
170:54 - on the back end
170:55 - and yes you can just have some
170:56 - communication between the two you can
170:58 - definitely do that
170:59 - yep okay and also another thing that if
171:02 - you're
171:02 - into machine learning and javascript you
171:04 - can look into tensorflow.js
171:06 - yep i mentioned that yeah definitely
171:08 - tensorflow.js yeah
171:09 - that would be really really powerful
171:10 - yeah sunny yeah okay
171:13 - okay one last question sunny okay
171:16 - like during my previous interview i was
171:18 - asked
171:19 - that in your on clones you use a react
171:22 - context api
171:23 - so when will you be switching to redux
171:25 - and how long so
171:26 - like what is the transition period
171:28 - between switching to
171:30 - from react context api to redux so
171:32 - remember
171:33 - there's not um oh thank you very much
171:35 - lee that's a very nice comment he said
171:37 - this session alone was worth more than
171:38 - the cost of pwj
171:39 - thank you very much dude um so yeah the
171:42 - transition well
171:43 - the reason why i teach react context api
171:45 - is because it's very easy to pick up
171:47 - right but the pattern is very is pretty
171:49 - much the same
171:50 - as redux right so i've learned redux and
171:53 - actually learnt the react context api
171:55 - afterwards
171:56 - and i was like oh my god i was mind
171:57 - blown how simple react context api was
171:59 - compared to redux but they use the exact
172:01 - same pattern
172:02 - um it's just there's there are
172:03 - differences and yes redux can be more
172:05 - powerful with the implementation
172:07 - but um and there's also things like
172:09 - relay now which i'm going to look into
172:11 - um but redux is something which is
172:13 - definitely sellable
172:14 - it's definitely going to make you more
172:15 - valuable and especially in the job
172:17 - market
172:18 - most companies have um user redux so i
172:21 - would definitely recommend
172:22 - learning it the transition is a case of
172:25 - use the react context api get it working
172:27 - do everything you need to do
172:28 - build a couple of clones with it like
172:30 - you you said you built the clones so
172:32 - honestly just just go ahead and check
172:34 - out like a tutorial on and
172:36 - on how to use redox and just follow it
172:38 - follow it build it along
172:39 - you'll see what i mean when i say the
172:41 - implementation the setup is more
172:43 - but the pattern is the same you dispatch
172:46 - an action and you listen to it in the
172:47 - reducer you do a bunch of stuff like
172:49 - everything sort of happens in the same
172:50 - way it's just the setup is more
172:52 - right so go ahead and just start with it
172:56 - that's my
172:56 - advice for that and we will eventually
172:58 - be dropping more redux content as well
173:00 - and
173:01 - and and moving into that space yeah okay
173:05 - i have an interview tomorrow wish me
173:07 - luck oh thank you good luck dude good
173:09 - luck
173:10 - nice thank you awesome stuff um
173:15 - before everyone hops off from the call
173:17 - or before they go to the questions
173:19 - i just want to say tomorrow at 11am pst
173:22 - we have a backup basics coaching call
173:25 - where if you are a complete beginner
173:27 - we'll be teaching you
173:28 - from the beginning like what is web
173:31 - development
173:32 - how to start with html and css and all
173:34 - this kind of stuff
173:36 - and it's it's gonna be like kind of like
173:38 - a series
173:39 - and as a project we are gonna be
173:41 - building a landing page
173:43 - so if you are a total beginner make sure
173:45 - to show up for tomorrow's coaching call
173:47 - make sure you go check that out guys
173:48 - because that would be really really
173:50 - handy and especially though a lot of
173:51 - beginners
173:52 - in today's call definitely go and
173:54 - honestly even if you're not a beginner
173:55 - go and check it out the reason being is
173:57 - the more exposure you have
173:59 - i guarantee like i i really surprised
174:02 - like it's surprising sometimes you think
174:03 - you know everything and then
174:05 - you like always have that beginner's
174:07 - mindset because honestly like whether
174:09 - it's like
174:10 - uh understanding how to use a keep like
174:12 - pedro honestly i didn't actually
174:13 - properly get how to use a key for a very
174:16 - long time and then i actually sort of
174:18 - like dove back into the the fundamentals
174:20 - and then when it was only when i had to
174:21 - teach it where i was like you know what
174:23 - keep seeing key pop-ups and then i
174:25 - started working in production
174:26 - environments and i was like okay this
174:27 - makes a huge difference when
174:29 - you have massive amounts of data being
174:31 - pulled through the app
174:33 - because a lot of problems you won't see
174:34 - on a small scale they happen when you
174:36 - have like a million records or something
174:38 - like that then it becomes like
174:39 - incrementally a bigger problem um so
174:42 - yeah
174:46 - um
174:48 - uh so let me so who is
174:51 - speaking so let me go ahead and let's
174:53 - just do a hand sort of like system so
174:55 - just raise your hand and i'll pretty
174:56 - much make my way through um so
174:58 - is it vinod was it who's that oh is that
175:02 - don
175:04 - okay don go go for it done uh just
175:06 - unmute yourself yeah
175:07 - hey sony uh hi um
175:10 - just want to ask a question question
175:12 - about uh
175:14 - those dependents to your such as cores
175:16 - mongoose
175:17 - that we've been importing into the files
175:20 - can we globally install them
175:21 - or uh do we have to be dependent on the
175:24 - projects
175:25 - um one second um i will bring this up
175:29 - so sorry ask that again please sorry
175:31 - done
175:33 - uh regarding those uh cores uh
175:36 - mongers those uh files the dependencies
175:39 - you
175:39 - install when you uh create react apps
175:42 - yeah basically can we globally install
175:45 - them so that
175:46 - uh they remain always yeah so so i'm
175:49 - glad you asked do not do that the reason
175:51 - why
175:51 - is because if you globally install it
175:53 - one it's it's terrible practice
175:55 - don't do that and the reason why you
175:56 - don't want to do that is because it
175:57 - doesn't add it to the project
175:59 - and what happens is you want all of the
176:02 - dependencies to belong to a project
176:04 - which because
176:05 - when you go ahead and push the project
176:08 - to
176:08 - like github for example let's say you
176:11 - added mongoose cords and stuff like that
176:13 - to your project
176:14 - pushed it to github and then i pull it
176:16 - from github right
176:17 - now when i do npm install mine breaks
176:20 - because it has no idea that mongoose is
176:22 - installed it has no idea that cause is
176:24 - installed on that project
176:25 - because you installed that to your
176:26 - computer not to the project
176:28 - right so it really is not good for
176:31 - sharing code and things like that now
176:32 - also um it's it's you
176:36 - i know i know i understand why you would
176:38 - want to do it
176:39 - but it's because every time you have to
176:40 - do it but the way of you have to change
176:42 - your approach to thinking about it like
176:43 - you have to install the dependencies per
176:47 - project as opposed to per uh just on
176:50 - your machine like
176:50 - because because you always got to think
176:52 - in terms of a team and and especially
176:54 - when you go into a commercial
176:55 - environment
176:56 - you install based on like if a guarantee
176:58 - even using pseudo in a commercial
177:00 - environment everyone freaks out like
177:02 - that but like they just kind of like
177:04 - they panic about it but yeah to answer
177:05 - your question
177:06 - stay away from global installs until
177:09 - only unless it's for something like
177:10 - firebase tools
177:12 - right which is they actually they will
177:13 - tell you to globally
177:15 - and if it doesn't tell you to globally
177:17 - install it on the
177:18 - on the docs don't do it yeah
177:23 - i have this uh like whenever we like
177:26 - let's say like we are installing
177:28 - firebase as a global thing yep
177:30 - uh and i remember that from your
177:32 - sessions like you were suggesting not to
177:34 - reinstall every time as a global i have
177:37 - this question like
177:38 - what happens when we reinstall as
177:40 - globally every time when we
177:42 - try to connect to firebase will it eat
177:44 - up the memory space or it just
177:47 - refreshes the existing global folder
177:50 - so it's not it's not going to eat up
177:52 - your memory space it's going to
177:55 - um you need like remember you're
177:57 - installing it just like imagine you
177:59 - download spotify and you install it on
178:00 - your computer right
178:01 - it's going to be on your computer but
178:02 - like imagine your program somehow relies
178:05 - on spotify
178:06 - when you push the code um let's say like
178:08 - pedro
178:09 - pulls your code he's not gonna have
178:11 - spotify on his machine
178:12 - right so he's gonna have to then go
178:14 - ahead and download spotify and do it
178:16 - whereas if you went ahead and installed
178:18 - it like npm install
178:20 - to to uh npm install spotify to your
178:23 - project now when he pulls it and he does
178:25 - npm install it installs spotify as part
178:26 - of the package
178:27 - right now what i would say is if you do
178:30 - npm install global twice
178:32 - all it's going to do is just install it
178:33 - globally twice which doesn't make much
178:35 - sense like it's not going to do it
178:36 - all it will do is if it's already
178:38 - installed it will usually update set
178:40 - that's it yeah okay thank you yeah
178:45 - sonny i have a question okay um
178:48 - so my question is related to like uh the
178:50 - class-based
178:51 - approach and the functional component
178:54 - based approach
178:55 - yeah so so he said that you have worked
178:57 - in tesco
178:58 - uh and other big companies so have we
179:01 - ever come across like a situation where
179:04 - you cannot convert like the class based
179:06 - existing class based
179:08 - uh component into like
179:11 - uh function based component right so
179:14 - very good like or
179:17 - or do we or can we like convert every
179:20 - single
179:21 - uh like class based component into
179:23 - functional component
179:24 - yeah um so very very good question
179:28 - to answer it very simply um uh with the
179:31 - introduction of hooks
179:33 - you can pretty much be sure that you can
179:35 - convert anything which is class-based to
179:37 - functional
179:38 - so okay to answer in terms of is it
179:40 - possible yes always
179:42 - it's possible um to answer uh
179:45 - if if i've done it well i've done it
179:47 - before like is that
179:49 - to be honest i am actually a big like i
179:50 - push i i really push it when i see it
179:53 - in the code base we i kind of everywhere
179:55 - i worked i implemented a strategy where
179:57 - if you touch a file which is a
179:59 - class-based component
180:00 - before you submit it and i would usually
180:02 - do a code review and say hey like no no
180:03 - no
180:04 - this isn't going through until it
180:05 - switches to a functional component
180:07 - and then what i would do is i'll pair
180:08 - program and teach them how to do it if
180:10 - they don't know how to do it
180:11 - um so that's what i would have done um
180:13 - but you can do it and
180:14 - the way you would do it is class-based
180:16 - components rely on something called
180:17 - lifecycle methods like component demand
180:19 - commercial update things like that
180:21 - uh there were the you're going to need
180:24 - to know how to use the use effect hook
180:26 - in order to convert things that's going
180:28 - to be the main sort of fundamental thing
180:30 - to know
180:31 - when you do that so that's going to help
180:32 - you a lot yeah
180:39 - uh sunny there is a tool called a state
180:42 - management tool called recoil
180:46 - what do you think about it do we learn
180:48 - this or
180:49 - redrugs um in fact
180:53 - i mean i haven't used it much but i'm
180:54 - just looking at a recoil facebook
180:56 - experience
180:57 - so recoil is part of i'm just checking
180:59 - experimental state management library
181:01 - for reactops yeah so
181:02 - a lot of people actually shouted this
181:04 - out to me inside of a live stream
181:06 - it's basically a replacement for redux i
181:08 - think um
181:09 - and it's part of facebook so i guess
181:11 - what they've done is they've seen that
181:13 - like people use redux
181:14 - they introduced a react context api
181:16 - which is somewhat of a
181:17 - replacement for it but recoil
181:20 - is about sorry apparently a much easier
181:24 - way
181:24 - of doing it so i'm going to look into it
181:26 - a lot more
181:27 - and then i can get back to you on that
181:29 - but i as for now
181:30 - i personally haven't used it much but
181:33 - feel free to jump in
181:34 - it's built by facebook so it's not a
181:36 - silly thing to go ahead and learn it
181:37 - because chances are
181:39 - um it will get picked up yeah oh good
181:42 - thank you
181:43 - thank you very much hey johnny i had
181:46 - some questions like
181:47 - i i made a quite a few clones and i made
181:50 - my own projects too
181:51 - and i started applying at some sites
181:53 - like upwork and freelancer and a work
181:55 - has that
181:56 - has that annoying problem that you have
181:58 - those points and if those points are
182:00 - used cannot apply anymore
182:02 - and i use freelancer but freelancer the
182:05 - thing is that people on this
182:06 - are mostly scams like i was in i was
182:09 - just
182:10 - they just scammed me for once and yeah
182:12 - and
182:13 - it happened like it's like i have the
182:15 - projects like i have the skill but
182:17 - nobody's actually ready to yeah
182:20 - like so what i would say is
182:24 - there's a few things you can do if you
182:25 - run into that um
182:27 - if you run into that problem firstly
182:30 - i've actually
182:31 - outsourced work before to freelancer and
182:34 - the person who done my work kind of
182:36 - tried to scam me but didn't realize i
182:37 - was a developer
182:39 - so i was like uh dude this code this
182:41 - goes crap
182:42 - i was like very very much so like it can
182:45 - well it can happen both ways so like
182:47 - people yeah i mean you get a very very
182:50 - like
182:50 - there are some bad people out there what
182:52 - i would say to it is
182:54 - um go ahead and doris says you need to
182:57 - drink some more thank you very much
182:58 - i will in a sec um so you need to go
183:01 - ahead and
183:02 - i would say focus remember it goes back
183:04 - to value right don't focus on like these
183:06 - platforms are good
183:08 - i don't even use upwork and freelancer
183:10 - anymore i just
183:11 - use network all right instead what i
183:13 - would say is build your social media
183:15 - presence like ammonite was saying before
183:17 - right
183:17 - it's a very good way of building your
183:19 - like sort of repertoire in the space and
183:21 - go ahead and like
183:22 - um just laughing at the comments uh uh
183:25 - so it's very good
183:26 - uh i need to yeah it's a good way of um
183:30 - uh of building up your presence and
183:32 - things like that and now naturally
183:34 - with that your skill builds and also
183:37 - you need to go ahead oh that's a good
183:39 - that's a good point pedro yeah so that's
183:40 - a good point
183:41 - we should have water breaks yeah um you
183:44 - also need to go ahead like it will build
183:46 - your skill set and it will also make you
183:48 - like it will demonstrate that you can
183:50 - offer value
183:51 - in a very non-salesman way right because
183:54 - naturally what can happen is we go out
183:56 - looking for it and we go out like kind
183:57 - of like
183:57 - what i would say is read the book soft
183:59 - skills if you haven't already uh have
184:01 - you actually
184:01 - have you read that book no i didn't but
184:04 - i
184:04 - i've watched a channel on youtube which
184:07 - which
184:08 - is all about recruitment and resumes so
184:10 - they usually tell how to start with
184:12 - freelancing
184:13 - so they said that if you just mail them
184:15 - out
184:16 - it will most probably go to the spam
184:17 - folder and nobody will ever see that
184:19 - yeah
184:20 - exactly and to be honest yeah sunny is
184:23 - a great suggestion that you and you were
184:26 - telling us
184:27 - uh before was like reach out just go
184:30 - to facebook and see business pages
184:33 - and see whether they have a website or
184:35 - or no
184:36 - yeah and if they don't have it what you
184:38 - you don't tell them
184:40 - you create a website for them yes and
184:42 - then reach out and say
184:44 - uh i have created a website for you
184:45 - would you be interested and
184:47 - send them images or you know screenshots
184:49 - of the website and
184:51 - make them feel interested like write a
184:53 - good good email or a message
184:55 - and send it to them and eventually they
184:58 - say uh if you if they find it really
185:00 - great they will surely pay
185:02 - pay you for that too yeah exactly and
185:04 - gary vee says something he says scale
185:06 - the unscalable right
185:08 - so you would naturally think in your
185:09 - head you would be like um
185:11 - how can i go around and build the
185:13 - websites for this guy this guy this guy
185:15 - but trust me like and that's gonna
185:17 - actually give you two things it's gonna
185:18 - make you get really good because
185:20 - you're you're gonna have to build
185:21 - websites for everyone that's one thing
185:23 - and two
185:23 - like by doing that like as in for
185:26 - example
185:27 - we if we took that mindset and we ran
185:29 - with it on youtube
185:30 - we never would have been able to at one
185:32 - point we pumped out a live
185:33 - every day with a new build on youtube
185:36 - which was just insane
185:37 - and like i was coding like for god knows
185:39 - how long every day and like i was just
185:40 - kind of pumping it out
185:41 - and because like and i and i never went
185:44 - into that with the sort of like idea of
185:47 - um with the idea of like oh uh like i
185:50 - want to make money from this right like
185:51 - if i did
185:52 - why not when it when debugging issue
185:54 - came up i just would have quit
185:55 - like honestly i would have quit like
185:56 - because i was just focusing on
185:58 - delivering value to someone else so what
186:00 - i would say
186:00 - like atharva is make go ahead reach out
186:03 - to like a
186:04 - facebook business pages are really good
186:06 - that's a really good point i'm going to
186:07 - like
186:07 - go ahead and see if their website looks
186:09 - crap or like if it's not responsive
186:11 - build something which looks really nice
186:12 - right like go ahead and say like hey
186:14 - just want to say i built this for you
186:15 - like uh like if you if you want it or
186:18 - you like it
186:19 - then like we can maybe have a chat like
186:21 - and then pretty much if they if
186:22 - if it looks good enough like a lot of
186:24 - the time it's the easy sell it's like
186:25 - hang on this guy just went ahead and
186:27 - built this like
186:28 - and then pretty much at that point i
186:29 - wouldn't even go in and talk don't be
186:30 - like i'm gonna
186:31 - i built this here it's gonna cost you
186:34 - this much money because it's salesman
186:36 - like that's why i'd say read the book
186:37 - soft skills is really good at teaching
186:39 - you
186:40 - that conversation and mastering that
186:41 - conversation you want to come out and be
186:43 - like hey like
186:44 - this this website will help you actually
186:46 - convert a lot more people
186:48 - i think it will bring in a lot more
186:49 - traffic it's seo friendly maybe look
186:51 - into those sort of things
186:53 - and it will help you out a lot more yeah
186:55 - but but otherwise
186:56 - yeah and sunday i just want to say also
186:58 - like another really good thing that i
187:00 - did when i was first doing
187:01 - um development stuff like back in the
187:03 - days what i did is
187:05 - i made um different websites for
187:08 - different verticals right
187:09 - so i made a website for a restaurant and
187:12 - then i started reaching out to
187:13 - restaurant people i made one for
187:14 - attorneys
187:15 - i made one for doctors i made one for
187:18 - dentists
187:19 - and then you could use that as your
187:20 - portfolio say yes i am a specialist in
187:23 - dentist websites
187:25 - and then you you you have a place of
187:27 - authority to say i don't just make
187:28 - websites i make websites for
187:30 - amazing websites for dentists and you're
187:32 - a dentist and i think you
187:34 - you can get more more clients that way
187:38 - exactly that's a really good way to do
187:39 - it too because then people feel more
187:41 - comfort like
187:41 - oh he's made dentist websites before
187:44 - let's
187:44 - let's go with that person they know what
187:46 - they're doing versus they're not going
187:48 - to go on upwork and know
187:50 - anything about web design right exactly
187:52 - so they get a thousand people that are
187:54 - just making websites they're like no no
187:56 - i specialize in dentist websites
187:58 - yeah that's how you pitch it to them or
187:59 - talk to them about it that's a really
188:01 - really good thing yeah exactly like um
188:04 - yeah again because then it kind of makes
188:05 - you a bit more of like a niche sort of
188:07 - like specialist thing
188:08 - and it also kind of narrows down your
188:10 - focus right if you're literally going
188:11 - ahead and saying like
188:12 - yeah like i i'm gonna find any business
188:15 - page it kind of becomes kind of
188:16 - difficult
188:17 - but if you get really good at making a
188:18 - beautiful looking dentist website
188:20 - now you can reuse that strategy change
188:22 - it up a little bit
188:23 - and that's actually really that's a
188:25 - really genius point there and i'd
188:26 - recommend yeah
188:27 - definitely find like a niche even a
188:29 - barber right a barber's a good one as
188:30 - well like barbara webb
188:32 - they usually never have a website
188:33 - they're like on google listing right
188:35 - but if you can go ahead and make them a
188:37 - really good website and charge something
188:38 - very cheap for it and be like another
188:39 - another thing we could do is like
188:41 - integrate something like calendly
188:43 - or something like that you know yeah
188:45 - exactly oh yeah calendly is really good
188:47 - yeah
188:49 - candy's really good on that topic uh
188:51 - either you sony or frank have you guys
188:53 - ever made
188:54 - websites to sell us templates is that
188:57 - is that a thing i have i've done that
189:00 - actually um i've i've made um now that
189:04 - i'm doing more
189:05 - react native stuff um i'm gonna put all
189:07 - my projects together on a couple of
189:09 - um different websites to try to see what
189:12 - happens and see if it sells right
189:14 - there's plenty of people that want to
189:15 - make you know like i said like
189:17 - a dentist app right or uh a wordpress
189:21 - site
189:21 - for dentists that includes booking right
189:24 - like uh like
189:25 - a monitor saying um you have to
189:27 - understand what the client needs
189:29 - and then most of the guys just need more
189:31 - clients
189:32 - so helping them on the booking even put
189:34 - some stripe thing in there so you can
189:35 - charge people
189:36 - right so that sort of thing it's it's
189:38 - adding value to them so it's not just a
189:40 - website
189:41 - they're they're they want to buy a
189:43 - solution they don't want to buy a
189:44 - website
189:45 - exactly yeah and also another thing they
189:48 - can do is they can go to dribble
189:50 - or mostly search and search for design
189:53 - inspirations that really work and from
189:56 - that
189:56 - based on those designs they can design
189:58 - the website like
190:00 - like frank said a common website for
190:02 - dentists so we can promote
190:04 - a really great uh website with a really
190:06 - great design
190:07 - and also mainly focus for uh dentist so
190:11 - and also if you can implement like kind
190:13 - of things like calendly stripe payments
190:15 - and all this stuff
190:16 - they would surely be down for it you
190:18 - know exactly and they'll pay a bunch of
190:20 - dollars for that
190:21 - hundreds of dollars for them exactly
190:24 - yeah
190:29 - i know it's pretty relative but um
190:32 - i understand that you can pretty much
190:34 - stop the client
190:35 - and you know win them but what do you
190:38 - think like would be like
190:40 - a very fair price like u.s wise i mean
190:44 - los angeles
190:45 - the way you think like you should charge
190:47 - them like
190:49 - a thousand dollars i charge a thousand
190:52 - dollars
190:52 - and then if they're like well that's too
190:54 - much it's like okay then
190:56 - three payments of 300
190:59 - 343 right so the idea is to tell them
191:02 - you have to say a big enough number so
191:04 - they take you seriously
191:05 - because otherwise they don't even take
191:07 - you seriously so say you know
191:09 - don't be afraid to tell somebody a
191:11 - thousand dollars for something right
191:12 - like that's not
191:13 - you have to get over that fear also say
191:15 - hey it's a thousand dollars like well
191:17 - why is it a thousand dollars
191:19 - i think you'll be able to book 15 more
191:22 - clients
191:23 - a month and then you're like okay
191:26 - to me 15 clients a month is worth more
191:29 - than a thousand dollars
191:30 - exactly that's the exact kind of sales
191:32 - pitch yeah yeah
191:33 - exactly but it's not even sales yeah
191:36 - it's not even sales you're
191:37 - like this is you you you don't say like
191:40 - a sales person right we're developers we
191:42 - say hey
191:43 - we provide solution the thing that you
191:45 - need the most is more clients
191:47 - right am i correct yes right okay right
191:49 - this is the tool
191:51 - to get more clients all about value
191:53 - exactly like you're bringing them value
191:55 - yeah
191:56 - i'm coming from a field of marketing so
191:59 - electronics so i know exactly what
192:00 - you're talking about so when you're
192:01 - talking about the price
192:03 - you don't tell them like okay this is
192:06 - how much it is you're gonna tell
192:07 - them okay this is what this product is
192:10 - gonna do
192:10 - for you yeah so if they see the value of
192:13 - what the product is gonna do
192:15 - for them they won't have a
192:18 - but also i wanted to be fair with the
192:20 - price and know
192:21 - exactly you know what where can i pretty
192:24 - much you know
192:24 - put the the range of the price exactly
192:28 - apple doesn't apple doesn't sell you a
192:30 - thousand dollar phone right they sell
192:32 - you something that makes your life
192:33 - easier
192:34 - yeah it's the fastest it's very smooth
192:36 - it's beautiful look at how beautiful
192:38 - this
192:38 - is right they don't focus on your price
192:41 - they don't care
192:42 - that's good hey sunny yeah yeah hi
192:45 - uh actually in our company we are gonna
192:48 - start a new project
192:49 - and it's an open like you can choose
192:51 - your own language and all
192:52 - right so one of the guy has suggested
192:54 - vue.js and i am suggesting react.js
192:57 - for the front end yeah so what pointer
193:00 - should i you know prepare to like preach
193:02 - them
193:02 - and um uh so let's come back to that
193:06 - hold that question once i just want to
193:07 - add to that one thing that frank
193:09 - because i think frank touched on gold
193:11 - there like is
193:12 - like honestly that conversation guys
193:14 - about like that that sort of salary
193:16 - because
193:16 - honestly just having a a sort of money
193:19 - conversation is
193:20 - very intimidating when you when you
193:21 - first start out like it's a very scary
193:23 - thing you have no idea like
193:24 - if somebody's like oh i'm interested
193:26 - you're kind of like oh my god i don't
193:27 - know what to price them at like and
193:28 - it can become that like just look at
193:30 - their products they offer a 500
193:32 - product right you can say okay this this
193:34 - web page is going to help you maybe land
193:36 - maybe four or five more
193:37 - clients that's like two to two and a
193:39 - half thousand
193:40 - two thousand 000 to 2 500 um i can offer
193:43 - you for like this
193:44 - pretty much offer it for a grand right
193:46 - at that point they're like
193:47 - they're like if you just went in saying
193:49 - this is going to cost you a grand
193:50 - they're like oh i'm going to pay a grand
193:52 - but if you're like okay no it's going to
193:53 - be 2500 then
193:55 - thousand is a still you see like it's
193:57 - all the sort of like it's the way that
193:59 - something is said and that's
194:00 - all about soft skills and that's just
194:02 - like really really gold point there
194:04 - um so that so thank you for that frankie
194:06 - that's really awesome man
194:12 - one of the things that i think is very
194:13 - important is how how you present it to
194:15 - the person
194:16 - yeah you know i sold a website for three
194:19 - thousand dollars and it was a very
194:20 - simple site
194:21 - yeah and i to be honest i did it on
194:24 - wordpress
194:24 - oh yes you know yeah the re the reason
194:27 - why is this is how you present the
194:28 - product if you tell the
194:30 - customer oh it's going to be a
194:33 - certain amount of money and then you
194:34 - just leave it out there of course
194:36 - they're going to freak out
194:37 - the first thing you got to say is it's
194:39 - this amount of money and boom moving to
194:41 - the benefits and just explain to them
194:42 - what you want to do i had the customer
194:44 - told me hey
194:46 - so it's too much money and i said okay
194:48 - so what's the difference between you and
194:50 - your other
194:51 - competitors and they're like well
194:52 - decides to do this and
194:54 - i'm like okay let me show you what i'm i
194:56 - can do and then you tell me if it's
194:58 - different
194:59 - i did the website yeah he loved it and
195:01 - they're like okay here's the money
195:02 - nice nice exactly yeah it is guys it is
195:06 - really how you
195:07 - you don't want to come across like a
195:08 - salesman like is in like literally the
195:10 - minute you start selling something it
195:12 - people start to run like it's really
195:14 - like a fine balance and honestly what
195:16 - i'll say is the truth is like
195:18 - you're gonna mess it up a few times like
195:20 - you're gonna learn from that experience
195:21 - and you're gonna get better at it
195:23 - uh just keep just don't give up that's
195:25 - my that's my main advice behind it um
195:27 - and implement the things that we said i
195:29 - just wanted to add to what frank just
195:31 - said
195:31 - yep um you know when you you bought
195:34 - about the you talked about iphone
195:36 - when you buy iphone you buy an
195:37 - experience you don't buy a phone yeah
195:40 - exactly it's the experience of owning an
195:42 - uh in a top-notch product
195:44 - and that's why they charge you premium
195:46 - for that so it's
195:48 - that's how you position basically all
195:49 - depends on how you position or what
195:51 - you're selling
195:52 - exactly exactly it does make a big big
195:55 - difference
195:55 - um and you're offering just because
195:57 - you're focusing around the value and
195:58 - then when people see the value
196:00 - the price doesn't really seem as bad as
196:02 - when you if you said it without any you
196:04 - know like features or value or anything
196:05 - like that
196:06 - um i want to touch back on the question
196:08 - now so the question was the
196:10 - uh there's a debate between view and
196:12 - react uh what was the exact
196:14 - question after that it was yeah yeah
196:17 - like in a company we are planning to
196:18 - have a new project
196:19 - and uh we are open to choose our own
196:22 - language whatever we want
196:23 - yeah so for front end i have suggested
196:25 - react and other guy he is opting for
196:27 - view
196:28 - okay so can you give some pointers you
196:30 - know where i can say that
196:31 - it is much better or too present um
196:38 - because the main thing here would be
196:40 - like i would be setting the base core
196:41 - structure
196:42 - and uh yeah i have uh three members in
196:45 - my team so i'll be teaching them and
196:47 - then
196:47 - they're working so yeah the thing is
196:50 - view is good
196:51 - view is good i'm not gonna hit on view
196:52 - like views it is a good like library
196:54 - framework or whatever they
196:56 - decide to call it um so v is a very good
196:58 - thing um i but i would say
196:59 - react the learning curve to react is
197:01 - extremely like low so
197:02 - so anyone if they've never coded in
197:04 - react before they can definitely you can
197:05 - teach it very well
197:06 - like is then you can vary it's just
197:08 - state and props once you master that
197:09 - once you
197:10 - master the idea of components it's the
197:12 - maintainability is very good like
197:14 - maintainability of react is is insane
197:16 - like you can build it in a way that is
197:19 - very easy to adapt it's very easy to
197:21 - maintain a large code base
197:23 - you can implement things later on down
197:25 - the line which make things a lot easier
197:26 - so i've gone into a huge code base
197:28 - before with the added typescript
197:29 - afterwards
197:30 - and the whole code base wasn't that
197:32 - difficult to to change typescript and
197:34 - that
197:34 - yeah you sure you can do that in other
197:35 - languages but um
197:38 - it's just there's a lot of things that
197:39 - you can add to like a to a react project
197:41 - which which are
197:42 - i would say the main thing is is the
197:44 - ease of learning the ease of learning
197:45 - and maintainability
197:47 - in my opinion yeah okay thank you
197:51 - does anyone else have any questions i
197:52 - saw some people kind of were about to
197:54 - ask questions and stopped yeah
197:56 - yes i have a question so um
197:59 - i've looked into react and also
198:03 - the node.js in order to build
198:06 - a little bit like a large application
198:08 - like a grouping or something like this
198:11 - yeah what would be the base thing to
198:13 - start with is it with uh
198:14 - can we build every entirely with the
198:16 - react um with routers or
198:19 - do we have to go with node.js and
198:22 - integrate react in that
198:23 - um so you were saying groupon was that
198:26 - yeah something like let's say for
198:27 - example i have to clone a groupon
198:29 - website
198:29 - so so you need to it kind of comes down
198:31 - to what features are required so groupon
198:33 - has multiple pages which means you're
198:35 - going to need react ruler or something
198:37 - like that to handle the page reading
198:38 - next js also does page viewing so you
198:40 - could use that right
198:42 - um now you're going to need a back end
198:44 - because groupon has data behind it right
198:46 - like you're going to pretty much pull
198:47 - some back
198:48 - i would recommend if you're if it's like
198:50 - a personal project just use firebase
198:52 - it's going to be very easy to get off
198:53 - the ground up and running
198:54 - it can be real time you have a nice user
198:56 - experience with that so that's going to
198:58 - help you with that but
198:59 - you're going to need pretty much a front
199:00 - end and a back end if it's a clone and
199:02 - you don't really care about the back end
199:04 - you could just do front-end build but if
199:05 - you wanna have something functional i'd
199:07 - recommend doing it as
199:08 - a uh a full stack app so you're gonna
199:10 - have react on the front end
199:11 - firebase on the back end firebase if you
199:13 - need more functionality
199:15 - you can actually go ahead and implement
199:17 - an entire backend using cloud functions
199:19 - so you can actually have it like express
199:21 - running on a cloud function
199:22 - uh we show that in one of the builds
199:24 - which is a really awesome use case for
199:26 - cloud functions
199:27 - you can actually have a like a complete
199:29 - backend running and you can very easily
199:31 - update it and do things like that with
199:32 - it
199:33 - um but it comes down to features like
199:35 - like
199:36 - if i was going to clone something and i
199:37 - saw that like it needed so i haven't had
199:39 - to use a reactor and everything because
199:41 - not everything required a few pages like
199:43 - i had single page apps like netflix was
199:44 - a single page app
199:46 - um if it needs authentication i i
199:48 - usually
199:49 - pull on uh firebase authentication to
199:51 - handle that um
199:53 - if it needs for example data uploading i
199:55 - use firebase storage because it's very
199:57 - simple
199:58 - just just find whatever the the simplest
200:01 - tool to get the job done
200:03 - is my approach but it comes with
200:05 - experience as well you're gonna you
200:06 - might build something and be like oh my
200:08 - god i over complicated this build
200:10 - way like too much and then the next time
200:12 - you'll be like okay i know i don't need
200:13 - this this is what i would say is
200:15 - piece it together as you need it and do
200:17 - that and do that a few times for
200:19 - different projects and you eventually
200:20 - get better at architecture
200:22 - right so you actually know you'll be
200:23 - able to like foresee a project and be
200:25 - like okay this consists of a b
200:27 - c different things so i know i'm going
200:29 - to need this this this and i've know
200:31 - from experience that like
200:33 - i should maybe use like firebase as the
200:35 - backend i should maybe use react router
200:36 - on the front end
200:37 - do i need speed to be like a massive
200:39 - thing if so i can maybe
200:41 - pull on things like server-side
200:42 - rendering so i could use nexus as
200:44 - opposed to normal react uh
200:46 - if i really care about like uh like if
200:49 - it's like a single page app or something
200:50 - i could use something like gatsby so i
200:52 - can make it static site so it's super
200:54 - fast
200:54 - i mean react by itself is very fast but
200:57 - did you see like it's a lot of like
200:59 - there's a lot of
200:59 - um experience will answer the question
201:03 - for you
201:03 - in the best way but um you could there's
201:05 - so many ways to build things nowadays
201:08 - but i would say keep it simple and just
201:10 - piece on as you need to
201:11 - and then that would be in most in most
201:14 - use cases especially with modern tech
201:15 - it's usually enough and then you you
201:17 - it's just about like
201:19 - okay this will give me slightly of an
201:20 - edge this means the page will load a
201:22 - little bit faster like we're using
201:24 - preact instead of react
201:26 - um to bundle to to make the bundle size
201:29 - smaller so that way the page loads that
201:30 - a little bit faster
201:32 - and the use case for that might be the
201:34 - app is based in third world countries so
201:36 - the data
201:37 - is going to be less which means that you
201:38 - need to make the app as small as
201:40 - possible
201:41 - um so you would use something like
201:42 - pre-act server-side rendering um so that
201:44 - way
201:45 - the server takes the load delivers a
201:47 - very tiny bundle
201:48 - and the person who's actually based in
201:50 - the starboard country who doesn't have
201:51 - access to a lot of data
201:52 - can go ahead and pull that in in a very
201:55 - quick way so you see like it's different
201:56 - use cases require different solutions
201:59 - and that will come with experience as to
202:00 - how you go ahead and approach that
202:02 - so we use heavily on react and
202:06 - use node.js whenever is needed yeah so
202:09 - in my opinion i would keep the
202:10 - javascript
202:11 - i'll just keep it as a javascript stack
202:13 - you can use node.js if you need a
202:15 - backend
202:16 - firebase actually eradicates the need
202:17 - for node.js sometimes
202:19 - you can just use the database side of
202:20 - firebase and you can pretty much do
202:22 - everything on the front end
202:23 - and if you do need more functionality
202:25 - like an express backend you can use
202:27 - node.js inside of a cloud function
202:28 - or you can do a man stack build so we
202:30 - have plenty of those the clones on
202:32 - youtube
202:33 - you can follow them on man stack build
202:34 - and do something like that
202:36 - what's the difference having started
202:38 - with the node.js and
202:40 - intro ad react in in in the
202:43 - node.js versus just start just with the
202:46 - react what's the difference
202:48 - so remember react is front end um nodejs
202:51 - is back end
202:52 - so essentially what i would say is
202:53 - always stop by just kind of build out
202:55 - your front end
202:56 - until you need the back end or like you
202:58 - could do it the other way around some
202:59 - people prefer it's just that preference
203:01 - i kind of tend to start with the front
203:02 - end and then when i need the back end
203:04 - i'll start implementing the back end
203:06 - um i tend to go towards firebase first
203:08 - and then if i need more functionality i
203:10 - will build a full node js back-end
203:12 - otherwise i changed like i mean don't
203:13 - over complicate if you don't need to
203:15 - like a lot of the
203:16 - completely powerful functional apps like
203:18 - the amazon challenge
203:19 - i didn't use an express backend we used
203:21 - um uh
203:22 - cloud functions at one point uh i think
203:25 - we did actually use
203:26 - express but yeah we did actually use an
203:28 - express um yeah
203:30 - we did yeah but the point is is that
203:31 - like if you don't need to use it don't
203:33 - over complicate the build
203:34 - yeah so start with the front end do it
203:36 - until up to a certain point and then if
203:37 - you get stuck
203:38 - um then start to implement like a back
203:40 - end and and just do it as you need to
203:42 - but
203:43 - again this will this will kind of iron
203:45 - out with experience and you start to see
203:47 - that like okay
203:48 - the clones are really good examples of
203:50 - getting that experience by the way
203:52 - yeah all right thank you can i
203:55 - ask a question sure yeah uh you know
203:58 - so my question was really to uh like if
204:01 - you start freelancing
204:03 - then the clients expect it to like do
204:05 - everything like so like
204:06 - design application development
204:08 - everything
204:09 - so so right now we are learning uh
204:12 - coding
204:13 - but what about like design so i was
204:16 - thinking like
204:16 - can we use like you know these themes
204:19 - which are available on theme forest or
204:21 - something like that can we use those
204:24 - templates
204:25 - and use it use it in our project or is
204:28 - it like
204:29 - complicated to use those things so
204:32 - yeah yeah you can so the the thing you
204:34 - have to be careful of is licensing
204:36 - if you use a template make sure
204:40 - and you're using it for a commercial
204:41 - purpose be careful of having the correct
204:43 - licensing because you might be using
204:46 - something which is free but if you want
204:48 - to actually commercialize it or use it
204:50 - to make money
204:51 - sometimes you need to buy a license for
204:52 - that and you can you can get
204:54 - hit quite hard if you don't do that um
204:57 - so you have to be careful of that stuff
204:58 - but
204:59 - yes you can um there's a lot of
205:01 - templates out there and i would
205:02 - recommend if you find a really good one
205:03 - without the licensing headache and stuff
205:05 - like that
205:05 - then and for example a lot of people do
205:07 - that with admin apps you know like a
205:09 - back-end panel with like a lot of number
205:11 - crunching and stuff like that
205:12 - they'll find a really good um a template
205:15 - and then they'll just repurpose it and
205:17 - reuse it
205:17 - right and then they'll basically plug
205:19 - and play and use it for a bunch of
205:20 - clients
205:21 - change it up as they need to and then go
205:23 - ahead and do that and
205:24 - but i would say get maybe don't rely on
205:27 - it as such
205:28 - we don't realize i would use it for
205:29 - things like a portfolio like use a
205:31 - template to make your portfolio look
205:32 - amazing if you want
205:34 - because there are but to answer your
205:35 - earlier question of like some
205:37 - clients require like you to be a
205:39 - designer pretty much and things like
205:40 - that
205:41 - uh your front-end skills naturally will
205:43 - progress as you sort of like the clones
205:45 - are very good at uh
205:46 - getting better with front-end skills
205:48 - things like dribble someone has
205:49 - mentioned dribble earlier
205:50 - that's really good at getting like
205:52 - inspiration right it's very good at
205:54 - getting inspiration for
205:55 - another website called front-end mentor
205:58 - yeah you have like front-end uh design
206:02 - challenges like they give you a for uh
206:05 - a jpeg image of a website design yeah
206:08 - what you've got to do is you gotta code
206:10 - it
206:10 - from scratch with html css and
206:13 - javascript
206:14 - so when you do things like that and also
206:17 - like
206:17 - when you just start designing things
206:19 - like and
206:21 - even my like if i uh that's how i grew
206:24 - my skills like
206:24 - on my instagram if you go to my first
206:26 - post it's
206:28 - totally ugly and with time and the more
206:31 - you do
206:32 - it automatically improves and also like
206:35 - another way it improved was like
206:37 - i used to see a lot of instagram posts
206:39 - almost every day that's related to that
206:41 - stuff
206:42 - so if you are into web designing and all
206:44 - this stuff
206:45 - just go uh go to websites like you know
206:48 - mostly search or
206:49 - dribble almost every day just go through
206:51 - those designs
206:52 - and from that you start to you know your
206:55 - mind will change
206:56 - yeah and you'll always think in that
206:57 - specific design
206:59 - there's neomorphism there's flat design
207:02 - and there's
207:03 - lots of stuff so the more you are
207:06 - involved in that
207:07 - in that stuff you get you get it into
207:10 - your body
207:11 - yeah because because because the risk
207:12 - with the third party themes is that
207:14 - sometimes
207:15 - they can change it or it can be like
207:18 - become incompatible with
207:20 - you know in future so we would like to
207:23 - take
207:23 - keep the control to ourselves so it's
207:25 - better to the
207:26 - best approach is to like do it yourself
207:28 - isn't it like design
207:30 - everything yourself isn't it to to a
207:32 - certain degree to a certain degree i
207:34 - mean like there are use cases where
207:36 - uh there is like if a freelancer like a
207:40 - it depends like in a professional
207:42 - environment put it this way like you
207:43 - usually have a dedicated designer
207:45 - who would have all the design work and
207:46 - then it's very easy to mask off of a
207:48 - design
207:49 - so like if you have the design given to
207:51 - you and what you could do is you can get
207:53 - but what am
207:54 - i saying is really critical because you
207:56 - like it's just like javascript is
207:58 - always evolving design is always
208:00 - evolving so like previously
208:02 - round buttons like a 3d buttons were in
208:05 - sort of in fashion right and then became
208:08 - like a
208:08 - flat design and then everything nowadays
208:10 - is flat and that's what we sort of tend
208:12 - to look at towards like
208:13 - as everything sort of being flat and
208:15 - sort of that kind of design
208:17 - um but um
208:20 - yeah i would say maybe look into things
208:22 - like sketch sketch is a good thing if
208:23 - you want to pursue a freelancing route
208:25 - things like sketch uh or like you know
208:27 - like design sort of libraries
208:28 - those are very good because you can very
208:30 - quickly yeah yeah because the reason
208:32 - being is like say you approached a
208:33 - freelancing client and they said like
208:34 - hey i want to do this job
208:35 - you can quickly draft up something on
208:37 - sketch which will be a lot quicker than
208:39 - coding here
208:40 - and then say like here's a rough idea of
208:42 - what i can provide for you
208:43 - um and then you can start a conversation
208:45 - because that's gonna save you a bit of
208:46 - time
208:47 - it's gonna save you some act it's gonna
208:48 - be a bit more realistic as approaching
208:50 - more freelancing people
208:51 - you can say okay here's a rough idea of
208:52 - what we can build together they can then
208:54 - basically say i don't like that but
208:56 - maybe we should change that
208:57 - um and then pretty much you can get
208:59 - conversation rolling and then it's
209:00 - basically an iterative process and
209:01 - you've kind of designed everything then
209:03 - at that point yeah by yourself you know
209:05 - so maybe don't code the template use one
209:08 - of those tools like sketch or something
209:09 - to sort of draft out or wireframe it and
209:12 - then go forward with that
209:13 - um
209:18 - if you are not using mac os you can use
209:20 - adobe xd
209:21 - or sigma yeah figma's good one as well
209:23 - adobe xd
209:24 - mark hey sonny hey dude thank you so
209:27 - much
209:28 - so i have a question about um
209:33 - just about when you when you if
209:35 - theoretically if i were to land a client
209:36 - i'm like hey i know firebase i can do
209:38 - this for you
209:39 - i can even do a stripe payment function
209:41 - yep how do
209:42 - how do you get to that deliver phase
209:44 - like how do you deliver
209:46 - that kind of thing because right now the
209:48 - firebase is obviously in my
209:50 - account would they make account with
209:51 - firebase and then i would just do that
209:53 - for them like how do you deliver
209:55 - oh you mean as in like how do you sort
209:57 - of once on your account
209:59 - how do you then get to their account
210:02 - yeah yeah so how do you like make that
210:04 - that transition that's a really good
210:05 - question because i remember yeah i had
210:07 - this exact same question when i started
210:09 - right
210:09 - and the easiest way to approach this in
210:11 - my opinion is you can do things like on
210:13 - firebase you can transfer ownership but
210:15 - it's kind of a
210:16 - i mean you can do that you can
210:17 - definitely do that frank because you
210:18 - told me that i didn't know you could do
210:19 - that before but
210:20 - um there are other things that you can
210:22 - actually do like for example whenever i
210:24 - have a freelancing client now
210:25 - to save myself hassle honestly more than
210:27 - anything i say to them like hey
210:30 - uh can you provide me with an email or
210:32 - your password and this is going to be
210:33 - the one that we're going to use to
210:34 - forward maintain it and basically
210:36 - everything is going to be hosted off of
210:37 - this
210:37 - if you can provide me that details i can
210:39 - get started by this date you see just
210:41 - incorporate it into the conversation
210:43 - and set everything up with their
210:44 - credentials to begin with
210:46 - and um and then say like hey like just
210:48 - go ahead create an account set a
210:49 - password for that or whatever you want
210:51 - to do
210:51 - and just send me the details and then i
210:53 - can go ahead and set everything up off
210:54 - of that account
210:55 - now even if like web hosting is another
210:57 - example
210:58 - um i would actually go ahead and don't
211:00 - buy the the sort of site yourself
211:02 - but instead go ahead and do the same
211:05 - approach with that
211:06 - and and do it in in that way um that
211:09 - would be a
211:10 - sort of the easiest way around it but
211:12 - you can do things like transferring
211:13 - ownership yeah
211:15 - okay i was i was getting getting stuck
211:17 - at that area which is why i haven't
211:18 - reached out to anybody yet yeah i'm like
211:20 - how do i even deliver this yeah no dude
211:22 - it's a good question
211:23 - i actually had the same thing i had the
211:25 - same thing and i and i thought it as
211:27 - well
211:27 - um so it's a good question yeah uh anish
211:31 - says at a certain point would you be
211:32 - teaching us how to create different
211:33 - environments like test environment
211:35 - environment
211:35 - so yeah we could definitely touch on it
211:37 - in in um in sort of a coaching call but
211:39 - what i would say at that point is you
211:41 - can use
211:41 - um environment files to address like
211:44 - production environment test environment
211:46 - definitely something to look into it
211:47 - there is a there's a whole sort of like
211:50 - there's a lot that goes into that and
211:51 - even with like ci pipelines and stuff
211:54 - like that it kind of feeds into
211:56 - environment variables and stuff like
211:57 - that but it's a whole other topic for
211:58 - another day
211:59 - what i would say at that point guys is i
212:01 - think we are going to cut it there
212:03 - because the session has lasted
212:05 - fairly decent time so i think three and
212:07 - a half hours i think that was an awesome
212:09 - session
212:10 - oh yeah four hours oh yeah damn damn
212:13 - yeah so
212:14 - guys i hope you enjoyed that and i hope
212:17 - that was uh
212:17 - one question okay go on let's squeeze
212:20 - one in
212:20 - one yeah yeah okay and i have a client
212:23 - um
212:25 - who wants a website
212:28 - for his for little business yeah
212:31 - so how can i um start making this
212:35 - a reliable website and i have another
212:38 - client
212:39 - who has a restaurant as well so i have
212:42 - no idea how to begin it
212:44 - okay uh what i would say is best way to
212:47 - speed that process
212:48 - is work through the um the modules
212:52 - so to get the grasp at the fundamentals
212:54 - so html css javascript
212:56 - then combine that knowledge with the
212:58 - clones that we've built on youtube
213:00 - so go ahead and build the clones with us
213:02 - on youtube that we've done already so
213:03 - there's
213:04 - tons of them and that we've dropped on
213:05 - youtube um
213:07 - and that's gonna really really help you
213:09 - sort of like have an understanding as to
213:10 - what you're gonna even need
213:11 - to power the sort of restaurant website
213:13 - or the other website
213:15 - and with that you'll have enough
213:17 - knowledge that um
213:20 - with that you have enough knowledge uh
213:22 - sorry i just saw something funny
213:23 - um with that you have enough enough
213:26 - knowledge to um
213:27 - to go ahead and and pretty much yeah
213:29 - make a decision on the builds that you
213:30 - need to do
213:32 - so only one last technical question okay
213:35 - uh dude uh
213:36 - okay go go for it that's guys there's
213:39 - absolutely no more questions after that
213:40 - yeah
213:41 - it will be quick so in firebase we used
213:44 - for to use database we usually use the
213:46 - db object which comes with firebase
213:48 - right so
213:49 - what if i what if someone just gets
213:52 - access to a db
213:53 - object somehow and just uses it anyways
213:56 - like
213:56 - to do changes in the database like we
213:59 - don't know like we are just passing the
214:00 - db dot collection and the collection
214:02 - name and everything
214:04 - we are not passing any restriction like
214:06 - this
214:07 - they make it so easy to set up that you
214:10 - actually miss where they implement the
214:12 - security
214:12 - right like there is there is a lot of
214:14 - security behind firebase
214:15 - um and and there's a lot that they do to
214:18 - make it that secure
214:19 - now think of it this way like it's you
214:21 - you you know that the credentials that
214:23 - we
214:23 - you host on your firebase.js file um
214:26 - even if someone was to get that they
214:28 - can't actually do much with it like it's
214:29 - public information
214:30 - like they they actually can't do much
214:32 - when you actually log in on your system
214:34 - you get
214:35 - a special like private token and they
214:36 - use that token to do a lot of stuff
214:38 - which is why if you're in the incorrect
214:40 - account and you try and deploy
214:42 - it kind of freaks out and it won't let
214:43 - you do it or when you go onto the site
214:44 - you'll kind of freak out
214:45 - um there's a lot of stuff behind it but
214:47 - one thing i would say is when it comes
214:49 - to security
214:50 - um be like i i wouldn't say like just
214:54 - try not to get so caught up with it
214:56 - because most of the time we're like yeah
214:58 - but what if they do this and what if
215:00 - they do that and what if they do this
215:01 - and like
215:02 - and the thing is is like there is with
215:04 - security there's so much to consider
215:07 - that like what i would say is dedicate a
215:08 - lot of your time towards the actual
215:10 - functionality react firebase that stuff
215:12 - that's the value right honestly getting
215:14 - um
215:15 - somebody to sort of understand like even
215:17 - if you spent hours and hours and hours
215:19 - and hours
215:20 - securing that little bit extra like the
215:22 - chances are the the site you built
215:24 - wouldn't probably get hacked
215:26 - anyway like or like and the chances are
215:28 - that it would kind of like go to a point
215:30 - where
215:31 - your return wouldn't be worth the
215:33 - investment that you put to put that
215:34 - security in place
215:35 - as in that's my honest opinion on it
215:37 - yeah
215:39 - yeah okay fair enough yeah um i also saw
215:42 - dick chan singh said i've
215:43 - raised my hand from beginning please
215:44 - take my quick 10 second question
215:46 - sonny go away yeah yeah one second dick
215:49 - champing uh
215:50 - go for it because he had his hand up
215:51 - from the beginning
215:53 - can you hear me yeah
215:57 - sorry i want to say that currently i'm
215:59 - i'm teaching three of my friends in
216:00 - three and one guy from insta
216:02 - now i'm just giving a startup motivation
216:05 - to him
216:06 - and i heard about vision.com earlier to
216:10 - teach the students
216:11 - so is it the correct platform
216:14 - for for teaching is it you're asking for
216:17 - why zan
216:18 - yeah yeah um so it was a little bit
216:19 - unclear so if you can't i think why is
216:21 - that's u.s only so maybe look into
216:24 - techlessons.com
216:25 - um take lessons.com honestly anywhere
216:27 - dude and honestly and what i would
216:28 - recommend is now that you're in pwj
216:30 - literally the introduce yourself channel
216:33 - where people are joining
216:34 - like literally just go ahead and like
216:36 - don't spam though trust me when i say
216:37 - like spamming never works like you're
216:39 - never going to land clients or students
216:41 - by spamming
216:42 - has to be very personal just offer value
216:44 - to someone else
216:45 - and pretty much reach out in that
216:46 - channel and ask if they need help or ask
216:48 - if that you can provide any sort of
216:49 - support
216:50 - if somebody gets stuck just kind of jump
216:52 - in you know like that sort of stuff
216:53 - it's a very good way of landing a client
216:55 - organically in a very good way
216:58 - and that's going to be very very
216:59 - successful as compared to sort of
217:00 - spamming everyone or like
217:02 - but takelessons.com is a good one um
217:04 - yeah and and honestly just type in
217:06 - coding tutors
217:07 - and pretty much you'll see like sites
217:08 - that pop up that's how i found one which
217:10 - was super
217:11 - the website was so clunky and it's
217:13 - called tutorhunt.com on inside of um
217:16 - on in in the uk but i never thought i'd
217:19 - land
217:19 - students up and i made a ton of money
217:20 - off that website um
217:22 - so yeah you'd be surprised um yeah
217:25 - but with that said guys i think what is
217:28 - insane that we can say that after
217:30 - four hours of a live call we still have
217:32 - um
217:33 - a hundred and twelve yeah you know
217:34 - restaurants are open now sonny you have
217:36 - to do a door dash
217:37 - i know dude i'm gonna i'll call mad by
217:39 - then she'll come over and cook me
217:41 - something
217:42 - um she's literally sitting here on the
217:44 - phone right now like that's why i was
217:45 - laughing earlier
217:48 - so uh yeah so guys with that said i hope
217:51 - you enjoyed that session
