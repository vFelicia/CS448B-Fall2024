05:14 - you there we go
05:16 - all right cool so program basic guys
05:18 - three
05:19 - two one so here's the question here okay
05:23 - how many bits are equal to one byte what
05:26 - do you guys think how many bits
05:27 - are equal to one but you guys have three
05:29 - seconds to answer
05:32 - all right let's go
05:36 - eight how many bits are equal to one
05:39 - bite
05:40 - wait i know this one
05:46 - what do you think you got it maybe
05:50 - maybe
05:53 - let's see all right let's see let's see
05:54 - let's see let's see 23 answers all right
05:57 - what do we have what do we have
06:01 - and we have a b it's equal to one but
06:04 - which one did you get
06:05 - yeah i was wrong
06:08 - all right so eight bits is equal to one
06:11 - byte
06:12 - guys that is what it is okay awesome
06:14 - let's go ahead again let's let me see
06:15 - who's the leader board here
06:18 - beginner wait did i not get it right oh
06:20 -  cuz i took time
06:21 - so beginner is winning all right next
06:25 - one
06:25 - let's go next one what is the output of
06:29 - this
06:30 - what do you think wait wait
06:35 - [Music]
06:37 - don't look
06:38 - [Music]
06:42 - all right let's see
06:46 - ten answers eleven you guys have ten
06:48 - seconds ten nine
06:50 - eight seven six five
06:54 - four three two
06:57 - one oh it's lamb
07:03 - somebody's sad
07:06 - wait something you said right there
07:12 - do you know why you know why
07:15 - so the reason why is because let me go
07:17 - first show media so let's check this out
07:19 - the reason why that's the case
07:21 - is because in programming ooh that's
07:24 - interesting that was your drawing
07:25 - yeah that was interesting so the reason
07:28 - why guys is actually because
07:29 - in this is an array right here right
07:31 - this is the race as you guys potentially
07:32 - know right
07:33 - now to access an array what's going on
07:35 - here is we're console logging we're
07:37 - outputting something right
07:38 - and we're outputting you know the
07:40 - instructors at position two you see this
07:42 - two
07:43 - there's two right so now what did you
07:45 - think this actually means tell me
07:47 - this two means what do you think this
07:48 - two means
07:50 - uh the second one the second one so
07:53 - that's all
07:54 - that's a lot of people think right
07:55 - you'll be it'll be jess is that what you
07:56 - picked
07:57 - so the reason why it's actually not just
07:59 - is because in
08:00 - um in programming everything starts from
08:03 - zero yeah that's why i thought
08:04 - after i saw that the answer was uh lim
08:06 - uh-huh
08:07 - that's what i thought you thought it was
08:09 - yeah it was zero one two yeah yeah
08:11 - because right now the first the first
08:13 - index this is called
08:14 - index always starts from zero then we
08:16 - have one and then we have
08:18 - two right there exactly and that's kind
08:20 - of how it always kind of starts out in
08:22 - programming guys so just so you know
08:24 - okay
08:24 - somebody now i get it there we go
08:28 - beautiful beautiful
08:29 - yeah so that's really fun one right zero
08:32 - one
08:32 - two always remember this in programming
08:34 - everything starts from
08:35 - exactly z zero
08:38 - exactly all right let's go and continue
08:40 - on so that's the reason why we have this
08:42 - beautiful all right
08:43 - next one let's see uh
08:47 - okay all right you guys ready let's see
08:49 - who got the next chord
08:52 - oh
08:54 - [Applause]
08:55 - [Music]
08:57 - [Applause]
08:57 - [Music]
09:06 - is
09:09 - [Music]
09:12 - okay next one are you guys ready yes or
09:14 - no all right nas
09:15 - but something you said yes
09:18 - that's funny all right next one next all
09:21 - right i got this really quickly
09:23 - what is the output of the first and
09:24 - second answer okay quickly
09:30 - wait what okay
09:35 - okay
09:36 - [Music]
09:48 - i got it that's it yeah picked i don't
09:51 - know why i picked
09:52 - it picked such a long time 90 seconds
09:55 - huh i don't know i don't know why it's
10:02 - ah
10:04 - all right 12 answers guys who can do
10:06 - more
10:08 - don't give the answers out in the
10:09 - comments guys
10:12 - don't look
10:15 - you're trying to help me huh they're
10:17 - trying to help me no guys don't help her
10:24 - let's go come on come on what do you
10:26 - guys think what you guys think
10:29 - what you guys think huh have 156 people
10:33 - live holy moly
10:34 - let's go all right let's go
10:38 - all right and what do we have
10:42 - [Music]
10:45 - uh yeah i think so i'm gonna go ahead
10:46 - click uh can i if i click skip will they
10:49 - actually count oh no
10:50 - i don't know
10:53 - i think if they click skip it will
10:55 - actually count let me see skip
10:58 - oh
11:02 - which one did you pick that one that's
11:04 - the one you picked yeah really
11:05 - yep yeah look at that did you guys help
11:08 - her out no they did not okay
11:10 - they helped me out after okay all right
11:14 - so
11:14 - again the reason why let's go through
11:16 - this why this is happening right why is
11:18 - this happening guys
11:19 - well very simply okay i'll go stop this
11:22 - one
11:24 - i need to remove this portion right here
11:25 - from my side okay
11:28 - so the reason why this is happening is
11:29 - very simple right if you think about
11:30 - this right let's think about this right
11:32 - well we have console log z that's the
11:34 - output right so that means that's kind
11:35 - of what well it gets outputted right
11:37 - well let's think about this we have z is
11:39 - the variable
11:40 - and we have x is also variable here you
11:42 - see that now
11:44 - this variable the value of this variable
11:46 - is 10. yeah the value of this variable
11:48 - is basically x plus 5 which is
11:52 - 15. yeah so that's 15 is the first
11:54 - answer and then we have next one we have
11:56 - x equals 20
11:57 - right and then z is equal to x plus five
12:01 - same thing 25 25. so it's pretty simple
12:03 - did you guys get that you guys
12:04 - understood that yes yes yes yes yes
12:06 - somebody said minha said there would be
12:07 - an error there yes there will be an
12:08 - error there
12:09 - i'm not sure where's the ear but the
12:11 - error i don't think there's an error
12:13 - here
12:14 - is there an error i don't think so
12:16 - anyway so that is the answer let's see
12:18 - who's the winner of this one
12:20 - and we have
12:23 - nasa's still on the running let's go
12:25 - let's go let's go now they're still in
12:27 - the running let's go
12:28 - okay but andy is coming up really quick
12:32 - look at this andy beginner pratik okay
12:34 - that's up where are you at i don't see
12:35 - you on there
12:36 - yeah i know
12:40 - all right next one what do you create
12:42 - well how do you create a function in
12:43 - javascript
12:45 - how do you create a function in
12:46 - javascript what do you guys think
12:48 - oh i gotta answer hold on otherwise
12:51 - i'll lose
12:52 - wait wait no come on we're connecting um
12:56 - okay i got it don't look i'm not yeah
12:59 - you are
12:59 - no i'm not yeah you are i'm not she's
13:01 - looking guys no
13:03 - yeah she is no okay let's see let's see
13:06 - let's see
13:06 - [Music]
13:10 - nope nope i put the comments up just
13:13 - look at the comments guys do not help
13:15 - other people well they just showed me
13:18 - that i'm wrong
13:19 - that's all i did
13:23 - all right let's see what you guys think
13:25 - what are you guessing
13:27 - all right let's see all right 21 you
13:30 - guys have 10 seconds left 10 seconds 10
13:33 - nine eight seven
13:36 - six five four
13:39 - three two one
13:42 - and the answer is i was wrong
13:47 - that is the way they beat gohan and
13:49 - create a function is you call the first
13:51 - first you call at first you call
13:53 - function
13:54 - right first you call function and then
13:56 - after that you say the function name and
13:58 - then you put parentheses around it to
13:59 - give it that
14:00 - can biscuit to start a function and then
14:02 - you actually use brackets for that as
14:03 - well so that's how you do that awesome
14:04 - let's go and continue on beautiful
14:06 - all right next one is
14:10 - wait who's going to know oh i'm still
14:12 - not i'm still black dynamite is coming
14:14 - up though black diamond
14:15 - is almost there black diamond is almost
14:17 - there let's go black dynamite
14:18 - whoo beautiful all right next one you
14:20 - ready are you sure
14:22 - as ready as i'll ever be are you
14:24 - harmless already as ready as i'll ever
14:26 - be
14:28 - let's go all right next one and what
14:30 - does it mean if
14:32 - if true is returned what does it mean
14:34 - what does it mean if true is returned
14:36 - guys what do you guys think
14:37 - if true is returned okay i know this one
14:41 - oh i got this one i got this one
14:45 - are you looking at me don't look that's
14:47 - the wrong answer did you already pick it
14:49 - no good well thank you
14:52 - for that
14:58 - so this by the way just so you guys know
15:00 - the module is here
15:02 - this month so this module is right here
15:08 - okay guys if you're spamming i'm gonna
15:10 - cut you out right now all right
15:12 - let me see where's this guy if you're
15:14 - spamming
15:15 - oh i enjoy i enjoy this
15:18 - right here so much there we go beautiful
15:22 - so guys so just so you know right what
15:25 - does this module
15:26 - mean this right here this modulus means
15:29 - that a number can be divided by two
15:32 - equal like if a number could be divided
15:34 - by two what does that mean
15:36 - what does it mean if a number can always
15:38 - be divided by two
15:40 - even exactly so it's this one
15:43 - right hand that's what i chose really
15:45 - yeah let's go
15:47 - hey let's go that's not an easy one
15:50 - yeah well i just figured because of math
15:56 - all right let's go somebody said 15 25.
15:57 - that does not that's not the answer guys
15:59 - all right there we go next one wow a lot
16:02 - of you guys did that holy moly
16:05 - i'm surprised so like i said guys the
16:07 - reason why this is the answer is very
16:09 - simply because
16:10 - why i modules 2 right here means that a
16:13 - number can be divided by 2 evenly
16:15 - right modulus means modulus actually is
16:18 - an operator
16:19 - that means basically
16:22 - how much something is left that's what
16:24 - that means so basically like
16:26 - if i do five modulus two
16:29 - the answer for that will be one because
16:31 - the remainder from that is one
16:33 - because four divided by two is even
16:35 - right so it'll be two times two
16:37 - and then the remainder of that will be
16:38 - one understand yeah
16:40 - awesome sweet so let's continue on
16:44 - let's go all right wait
16:48 - all right okay next one and we have
16:51 - oh nas is still in the winding let's go

17:10 - have some fun sometimes you know i know
17:13 - how else are you very far behind wait
17:16 - you just told us the answer i did not
17:17 - tell you guys the answer
17:19 - i never told you guys the answer did i
17:21 - tell you guys the answer no no i didn't
17:22 - tell you
17:23 - no all right next one next up what is
17:27 - and and
17:28 - end wait i actually don't know this one

17:44 - is it i might have gotten this one wrong
17:45 - actually hold on
17:48 - because i forgot the name actually do
17:49 - you remember from like code academy
17:51 - really yeah your mom with this one
17:53 - because i forgot to recognize it
17:55 - i know i mean i know what it is i know i
17:57 - know what it does but i think i got it
18:00 - wrong
18:02 - oh man yeah i got it wrong
18:06 - damn it hmm
18:23 - don't tell the answer valeria says don't
18:24 - tell the answer guys
18:26 - all right guys and how do we have 26
18:28 - answers 27 answers
18:30 - since one day more people come into here
18:32 - [Music]
18:34 - logic go let's go oh let's go
18:37 - all right and we're done and ten nine
18:40 - eight
18:41 - seven six five quattro
18:46 - uno oh
18:50 - it's a logical operator i put down
18:52 - conditional operator for some reason i
18:53 - don't know the comparison
18:55 - the comparison operator that's that's a
18:56 - pretty good choice too dang it i don't
18:58 - know
18:58 - i thought it was because it's inside a
19:00 - conditional see
19:02 - even a pro developer sometimes we'll get
19:04 - we'll get messed up
19:06 - yeah that's okay all right mistakes
19:08 - happen
19:09 - yeah why this guy be so annoying i don't
19:12 - know if i'm annoyed then just you know
19:14 - then move away from this youtube channel
19:15 - from this youtube video
19:19 - oh no oh no but again i'm coming for you
19:22 - my friend i am coming for you my friend
19:23 - he's not a beginner
19:25 - he's not a beginner no he's a beginner
19:26 - just you know but i'm worried i come i
19:28 - got you i got you don't worry
19:30 - i got you i got you
19:33 - all right next one i got this one what
19:35 - kind of a loop is this and what is the
19:37 - maximum number of candies i got it
19:39 - okay
19:44 - oh
19:51 - [Music]
19:58 - [Music]
20:05 - got it all right not so sure got it
20:10 - what do you think not so sure but why
20:12 - not i'm trying what is what do you think
20:14 - it is
20:15 - like i recognize that from like from
20:17 - kota candy right
20:19 - yeah but at the same time i'm not sure i
20:22 - just remember it's like seeing it
20:23 - yeah yeah so like what do you think
20:27 - is happening here i'm curious uh
20:30 - well it's greater than or equal to but
20:32 - it says
20:34 - what kind of loop is this and then the
20:35 - maximum number of candies okay
20:37 - so it has to be more than 15
20:40 - but um well it's less than this is less
20:43 - than there's actually
20:44 - x is less than equal to you see that
20:45 - right there
20:49 - so so what happens here is this x
20:51 - actually less than or equal to 15 right
20:53 - so
20:53 - this variable has to be smaller see this
20:56 - right here this bracket means smaller
20:59 - than 15 right here because if it's
21:01 - otherwise if i want to be greater that
21:03 - means i have to do
21:04 - x greater than 15 right here
21:07 - right there that's kind of how that
21:08 - would be yeah
21:10 - yeah yeah it's hard sometimes you can
21:12 - mess up sometimes that's yeah it's hard
21:13 - to do that once though sometimes yeah
21:20 - no i don't know actually do you know
21:22 - [Music]
21:24 - i don't know i don't know actually okay
21:26 - awesome so let's go and continue on
21:27 - awesome so we got that one that's fun
21:29 - so we got ten nine six
21:32 - five four three two
21:35 - one
21:39 - which one is it one is it i got it i got
21:42 - this one
21:42 - i got this one right i got this one
21:43 - right this one right
21:47 - oh let's go hold on make that face again
21:55 - which one did you pick the blue one the
21:58 - blue water what'd you put
21:59 - i mean you're not far it's a while loop
22:01 - you know yeah
22:03 - [Laughter]
22:07 - so the reason guys why we have that
22:10 - it's a do while loop right and if you
22:12 - think about this it's not a while loop
22:14 - so while loop will actually have the
22:16 - while on this right here will actually
22:17 - be on the top
22:19 - so when if you do that then that's
22:21 - called a while loop okay
22:23 - hi everyone hi everyone good good so
22:25 - that's called the while loop so that's
22:26 - on the top right here you see that
22:27 - yeah but because we started with do we
22:29 - do say do
22:30 - and then while something's happening so
22:33 - while something is true
22:35 - so basically do this functionality while
22:38 - something right here is true
22:41 - well what can i say
22:47 - well something is true and the reason
22:49 - why it's 15 and not 16
22:51 - is what do you think guys the reason why
22:52 - it's 15 not 16 is because it's very
22:54 - simple
22:55 - here think about this so it starts off
22:57 - with zero so x
22:58 - usually starts off with zero so we're
23:00 - going to start out with zero initially
23:01 - kind of like this right
23:03 - and then what's going to happen is we're
23:04 - going to what is it what do you think is
23:05 - x plus plus means
23:07 - i don't know so this means increment
23:09 - right this must increment so for example
23:11 - if we have if x is equal to one right
23:13 - now
23:14 - right is equal to one right now right if
23:17 - i do x plus plus it's gonna be equal to
23:22 - you tell me
23:26 - so so if i do x plus plus
23:29 - it's going to increment by one okay so
23:31 - three
23:32 - well one plus one
23:39 - [Laughter]
23:41 - so it's going to be two right here okay
23:44 - okay i know so i said you've done the
23:46 - value of x but you kind of have to
23:47 - assume that the value backs at this
23:48 - point is kind of zero basically that's
23:50 - pretty much it
23:51 - so that's going to be that so x plus
23:53 - plus and what's going to happen
23:54 - every single time we're going to income
23:56 - at that basically one
23:57 - you know that's going to be two then
23:58 - it's gonna be three then four and five
24:00 - and six and then we're going to what
24:01 - we're going to print it out you see that
24:02 - right there this x right here in the
24:03 - console
24:04 - log that's going to be printed out okay
24:06 - so basically it will say the number of
24:08 - candies
24:08 - is zero then the number of candies is
24:12 - one then
24:15 - two and then it's going to go all the
24:17 - way till 15
24:20 - because when it's 15 it's going to say
24:22 - 15 here
24:24 - right and then it will increment to 16.
24:27 - okay you see but is 16 less than 15
24:32 - no no so we'll actually exit this loop
24:35 - out of this loop
24:36 - it will say stop and i will i will not
24:38 - do this anymore that's it
24:39 - okay understand beautiful do you guys
24:41 - understand
24:42 - yes no it's actually it's 15 guys it was
24:45 - 15.
24:46 - all right so kennedy's is 15 not 16.
24:48 - okay trust me i know that bill i
24:50 - know i don't know i think i partially
24:52 - built this one
24:54 - anyways guys so okay let's see the
24:56 - scoreboard who we got here
24:58 - a lot of you guys pick 16 that's
24:59 - interesting alright next one
25:03 - oh come on i got you beginner i got you
25:07 - i got you all right next one all right
25:10 - hold on hold on i'm gonna get ready
25:12 - which student is a point to nasa today
25:13 - according to console log i got this
25:16 - okay let's see on duty
25:21 - sorry instructors now sorry
25:28 - okay i see it okay got it done
25:35 - i have no clue whatsoever what's going
25:37 - on yeah yeah so this one is a hard one
25:40 - you kind of have to follow you kind of
25:42 - have to follow this
25:44 - thing about this so what is structure is
25:46 - a pointer to to nas right
25:48 - so you can see we have instructors this
25:50 - is variable instructors is an object see
25:52 - this object
25:54 - and the variable on duty here is not
25:56 - sorry so it's going to go to here
25:58 - right and then see the appointed
26:00 - instructor the student for this is going
26:02 - to be march cohort which is also a
26:03 - variable which is this one
26:05 - yeah yeah you see that and then it's
26:07 - going to go to students
26:08 - which is this one okay go back to the
26:11 - answer so i can answer
26:14 - okay hold on go all right let's see go
26:18 - go go go
26:25 - what do you think remember how you had
26:27 - to remember how we had that zero one two
26:29 - thing
26:30 - i know did you pick it yep yeah the
26:32 - right answer
26:33 - all right you think you picked the right
26:34 - answer yes do you guys think she picked
26:36 - the right answer what do you guys think
26:38 - give me a thumbs up if you think she
26:40 - picked the right answer give me a thumbs
26:41 - down if you think she picked the wrong
26:42 - answer
26:45 - [Laughter]
26:49 - yeah i think be funny
26:54 - what i don't know all right you guys
26:56 - have 10 seconds left because i'm going
26:57 - to give you 10 seconds not
26:59 - i give i give you way too much time here
27:01 - all right it's going to be 10

27:13 - 1 and we're done and
27:16 - we are i'm playing i'm pressing skip
27:18 - right now skip skip skip
27:20 - skip skip skip skip boom nice
27:23 - hey let's go you got it right
27:26 - that's what i'm talking about beautiful
27:28 - and i got a ride too actually so i'm
27:30 - gonna do this
27:31 - next come on
27:34 - beginner's still there i'm watching you
27:36 - beginner
27:40 - don't worry i see you
27:42 - [Music]
27:44 - i see you very closely all right correct
27:47 - correct right but
27:48 - with the way who's beginner in the
27:50 - comments guys who is beginner here in
27:51 - the comments i'm very curious i'm very
27:53 - curious who is here who is the beginner
27:54 - one here
27:55 - i'm very curious with the beginner
27:57 - person here all right
27:59 - all right next one we have let's go quiz
28:02 - good what language will be logged
28:06 - got it word
28:10 - kunichiwa got it
28:16 - got it what do you guys think
28:24 - what do you guys think you picked it
28:28 - yes yeah yeah
28:34 - all right you guys i will give you guys
28:35 - about 20 seconds ready
28:37 - 20 19 18
28:40 - 17 16 fifteen
28:44 - fourteen thirteen twelve
28:47 - eleven ten nine
28:50 - eight seven six
28:54 - hold on i'm gonna zoom in just for you
28:55 - guys so you can see it six
28:58 - five four
29:01 - three two
29:04 - one and i'm pressing on pressing on
29:08 - pressing i'm pressing i'm pressing
29:10 - pressing skip
29:12 - dawn it is japan oh damn she got it
29:15 - right
29:16 - dang it so let's let's talk about why
29:20 - that's the case right because i'm almost
29:22 - interested in explaining a little bit
29:23 - here right so let's think about why here
29:26 - again why because we're logging out
29:29 - something and we're calling the function
29:30 - say hello
29:31 - okay so guys so we'll have this function
29:33 - called say hello and this
29:35 - takes a parametrical greeting a
29:36 - parameter is like something you
29:37 - basically take a parameter you put into
29:38 - a function
29:39 - and so you can use that later on right
29:42 - basically i can pass in anything i want
29:44 - into this parameter
29:44 - you see what i mean a string a number
29:46 - whatever i want okay
29:48 - and then what's going to happen here is
29:49 - that this parameter
29:51 - then will look at this will be called
29:56 - another function of another call called
29:57 - get translation
29:59 - with that same parameter and so this is
30:02 - the function called cat translation
30:03 - and now this parameter biscuit just goes
30:05 - down the tree and is passed into here
30:07 - you see that
30:08 - okay and so now biscuit we have an if
30:10 - statement with an else if statement so
30:12 - if a word is hello
30:14 - return english if it's hollow dutch
30:19 - it is japanese said penis and what did
30:22 - we say
30:25 - that's funny actually when you said
30:27 - konichiwa you know how i know basic
30:29 - japanese
30:29 - oh yeah well
30:32 - that's how i figured it was japanese oh
30:34 - there you go so it's not program related
30:38 - language my knowledge of languages
30:42 - all right sure sure okay
30:46 - next one dammit this beginner guy is so
30:50 - good
30:52 - all right i'm coming up to you don't
30:53 - worry my friend alright so nas
30:55 - is right there but we have black
30:56 - dynamites coming up ariel's coming out i
30:58 - still don't see you on there
30:59 - yeah i'm like far behind because of the
31:02 - beginning
31:03 - yeah yeah yeah okay we have a well i
31:05 - think we have one more left guys do we
31:08 - one more left okay ready what answer
31:10 - makes victoria recursive function okay i
31:11 - got this
31:15 - uh got it
31:18 - [Music]
31:20 - done beginner coming from you i hope
31:23 - again everyone gets this one wrong
31:33 - you guys will have 20 seconds what do
31:35 - you think
31:37 - now do you know what do you know the
31:38 - recursive function no way
31:40 - a function a recursive function is a
31:42 - function that calls itself
31:43 - so it's like imagine like me putting a
31:46 - bottle inside another bottle
31:47 - yeah i was kind of looking at that or in
31:49 - the comments yeah so it's like
31:51 - it calls a function inside its own
31:52 - function basically and hopefully you
31:54 - guys can see that by the way
31:55 - [Music]
31:57 - right there go back to the answers
32:01 - there you go
32:04 - not lucky no
32:06 - [Laughter]
32:09 - i almost dropped the phone
32:12 - no you should pick something yes what'd
32:14 - you pick
32:15 - i'm not telling you right now
32:19 - since i have an answer dutch
32:22 - konichiwa konichiwa somebody said
32:26 - that's already in my mind beautiful well
32:28 - now let's put it to practice
32:30 - good good good good good good good good
32:36 - nice okay let's see let's see who won
32:39 - here let's see who won let's see let's
32:40 - see let's see let's see you know
32:41 - laugh at if beginner is kazi
32:45 - no cause this might not this should not
32:48 - be you
32:51 - he would do something like that he would
32:53 - do he would put himself
32:54 - uh he would do something like that i
32:56 - know it i i know it
32:57 - alright 10 seconds guys 10 9 8
33:00 - 7 6 5 4 3
33:04 - 2 1 and skip
33:09 - you got it right holy damn she had
33:11 - an answer streak of three
33:15 - what something
33:18 - [Laughter]
33:20 - that's funny so look so let's think
33:21 - about this guys the reason why it's
33:22 - factorial right because what is
33:24 - factorial factorial is basically
33:25 - five times four times three times three
33:27 - times one right so you're multiplying
33:29 - the number below it okay now in coding
33:32 - if we want to basically call a recursive
33:34 - function we have to call ourselves
33:36 - right and so let's say i do something
33:38 - like this if i do something like this
33:40 - let's just say that i do something like
33:43 - n
33:44 - uh n times basically
33:48 - let me see get factorial
33:53 - toward real of n
33:56 - minus one right what's going to happen
33:59 - here is very simple basically
34:02 - we're gonna have five here let's just
34:04 - say we initially start up with five
34:06 - then we're gonna call ourselves again
34:08 - right
34:10 - which is gonna call n times
34:13 - get factorial you see that and so this
34:16 - is gonna be now four
34:19 - you see that so now this five this guy
34:22 - factor
34:22 - gets replaced by four times itself
34:26 - get it and then this gets replaced and
34:29 - then by three because we're also
34:31 - always subtracting one until basically
34:34 - uh
34:34 - zero and then when zero then we start
34:36 - just stop
34:37 - understand so that's really cool guys
34:39 - you guys understand yes or no
34:40 - nice beautiful beautiful beautiful yeah
34:42 - i know something something to add an
34:44 - exit case i think it's the beginning bd
34:45 - is a beginner it helps i feel like
34:47 - that's that's the beginner
34:48 - yeah i feel as a beginner yeah anyways
34:50 - that's kind of it that's pretty much it
34:52 - from
34:52 - from from that point of view so let's
34:54 - see let's see who won
34:56 - this round guys ready are you ready
35:00 - yeah you ready i really hope we can did
35:02 - not win let's see podium all right let's
35:04 - go
35:05 - third place comes from snp let's go
35:08 - smp second place comes so
35:12 - i think i won i think i won watches
35:14 - someone else
35:20 - oh yeah ariel's fifth black diamond is
35:24 - fourth
35:25 - let's go beautiful beautiful beautiful
35:29 - that's what i am talking about somebody
35:31 - said please do quit do the quiz again
35:34 - we'll do that next time guys that was
35:36 - fun did you like it
35:37 - yeah i did like it that was fun right i
35:39 - thought was fun yeah these quiz are
35:40 - pretty cool
35:41 - i mean i have another bigger quiz but we
35:42 - can do that another time guys that's
35:44 - pretty much it guys from us
