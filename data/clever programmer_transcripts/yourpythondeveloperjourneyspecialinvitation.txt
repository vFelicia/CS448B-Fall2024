00:00 - hey you what is up this is Kazi from
00:02 - clever programmer calm I have a very
00:04 - special invitation for you I have a
00:07 - webinar coming up ok it's called how to
00:09 - become a Django Python full stack web
00:11 - developer and a freelancer that's gonna
00:13 - be below in the description and I'm
00:15 - probably gonna talk about it at the end
00:16 - of the video but in this video I wanted
00:17 - to give you a lot of value and I want to
00:19 - give you your roadmap to becoming a web
00:21 - developer with Python now if you're a
00:24 - complete beginner right now you're like
00:25 - I don't even know where to start there
00:27 - are a couple of things that I want to
00:29 - clarify with you that a lot of people
00:31 - don't talk about a lot of the times it's
00:32 - like you'll look at you know people are
00:34 - like just do a lot of web development
00:36 - stuff or do a lot of coding and do a lot
00:39 - of data structures and algorithms and
00:41 - just one day cross your fingers and
00:43 - that's actually how you're gonna get a
00:45 - job right just apply to like a bunch of
00:47 - interviews on indeed.com on monster
00:50 - everywhere else and just keep doing data
00:52 - structures and you're probably gonna
00:54 - land a job one day but a lot of you are
00:56 - probably not in a position where you
00:58 - have a developer job right and you wanna
01:00 - you want to get that experience before
01:02 - you get to that entry-level job that
01:04 - says you need three years of experience
01:05 - before you get that entry-level job okay
01:08 - so it's kind of a catch-22 here so what
01:10 - I want to show you is that there is a
01:11 - way that you can go from a beginner and
01:13 - then there's an awesome step before you
01:15 - start learning web development where you
01:17 - can actually be earning an income so you
01:19 - don't have to in this way you can maybe
01:21 - even quit what you're currently doing
01:23 - okay some people I've talked to you and
01:25 - you guys have told me that you're
01:26 - actually currently driving an uber and
01:27 - want to become a coder so like how are
01:29 - you gonna go from a beginner to becoming
01:31 - a web developer if you're spending a lot
01:33 - of your time doing all that other stuff
01:34 - because coding and web development all
01:37 - the stuff is actually hard and it's very
01:38 - time-consuming and it's very demanding
01:40 - so unless you're earning an income from
01:42 - doing this stuff unless you can actually
01:44 - let go of other things that you're
01:46 - focusing on and make this your primary
01:48 - focus it's gonna be a very long journey
01:49 - and that's the journey that people talk
01:51 - about that takes years and that takes
01:54 - maybe a degree and that takes maybe like
01:57 - just a lot of stuff that you know like
01:59 - certifications that you actually in
02:01 - reality don't really need okay so I'm
02:04 - gonna reveal to you my process okay and
02:07 - I'm gonna make it as simple as possible
02:08 - so you can understand and follow me
02:10 - along so check it out okay here
02:12 - the process overall process I'm going to
02:14 - break it down one by one it's a
02:16 - four-step process okay it's not easy but
02:21 - it is simple okay let me say that again
02:23 - it's not easy but it is simple so if you
02:26 - all disclaimer if you only want to do
02:28 - this to make money there are much better
02:31 - ways to make money and probably don't do
02:33 - this but if you want to actually learn
02:35 - how to code become a web developer get
02:38 - committed to becoming a web developer
02:40 - find time that you'd never thought that
02:41 - you actually had and then go on this
02:44 - journey which is actually a difficult
02:46 - journey right and become a web developer
02:48 - let me actually show you how it works
02:50 - okay so first you're gonna start off
02:52 - maybe this is where you are currently or
02:54 - even if you're past or whatever right
02:56 - first you're gonna start off learning
02:57 - the basics so this is step one this is
03:00 - learning coding learning Python learning
03:04 - variables learning loops learning
03:05 - conditional statements conditional flow
03:09 - right if-then statements for loops while
03:10 - loops and just mastering basics of
03:13 - Python okay you should be able to solve
03:15 - things like fizzbuzz all right look it
03:18 - up if you don't know what it is you
03:19 - should be able to solve basic coding
03:21 - problems you should be able to solve
03:24 - basic coding problems that's what I'm
03:26 - repeating it because it's important okay
03:27 - you should be able to go in hacker rank
03:29 - and at least do easy problems okay and
03:31 - maybe a little bit of intermediate
03:33 - alright that's this part so getting your
03:37 - fundamentals down and now check this out
03:40 - you don't have to spend years learning
03:43 - coding before you start making an income
03:44 - here's an awesome way and I'll tell you
03:46 - why it's an awesome way so you need more
03:49 - time like what if you could actually
03:51 - start earning an income from coding
03:53 - right wouldn't that give you a lot more
03:56 - time to learn coding what if you can
03:58 - earn an income from the stuff that
04:00 - you're actually learning now instead of
04:04 - waiting till you start competing with
04:07 - the rest of the world on up work to
04:10 - become a freelancer where you fight to
04:12 - the ground and you try to charge like $8
04:15 - an hour and you still don't get a job
04:17 - because there's another developer in a
04:19 - third-world country who will beat you
04:21 - there and charge like four dollars an
04:23 - hour all right so let me show you what
04:25 - that step
04:25 - is coaching all right
04:29 - this is a step that a lot of people miss
04:31 - like almost everybody misses this step
04:33 - this is coaching's finding somebody
04:35 - who's willing to pay you to learn what
04:37 - you currently have in your brain from
04:40 - learning basics of Python okay these
04:43 - people will pay you good amount of money
04:45 - to just learn coding from you you can
04:48 - find these people online on online
04:49 - platforms okay like take lessons wise
04:51 - and Craigslist or you could look for
04:54 - these people in real life and learn this
04:57 - stuff okay and so that's the step with
05:02 - coaching this will help you make at
05:05 - least okay depending on obviously how
05:08 - much you work how hard you work to find
05:11 - them and work with them you'll be making
05:12 - at least five hundred a thousand dollars
05:15 - extra per month doing this stuff and if
05:18 - you want to scale it higher you can
05:19 - scale it higher and be making even two
05:21 - or three thousand dollars a month it
05:23 - won't just happen instantly it's hard
05:25 - work but it's very doable and you can
05:27 - earn that income and you can make that
05:29 - money
05:29 - and what's the beautiful thing that
05:31 - starts happening when that you start
05:32 - making those two or three thousand
05:33 - dollars a month your brain goes holy
05:36 -  I can actually make money from
05:38 - coding and I can maybe spend a little
05:41 - bit less time on the other stuff I'm
05:43 - doing right maybe you're doing like 40
05:44 - hours a week maybe you have another
05:46 - part-time job and it's not giving you
05:47 - time to learn coding well guess what
05:49 - when you're coaching and making an
05:51 - income from coding you can replace the
05:53 - other stuff you're doing with coding so
05:56 - you're gonna be improving your skills
05:58 - massively you're gonna be earning an
06:00 - income while you're actually doing it
06:02 - you're gonna get experience on how to
06:03 - work with clients how to get clients how
06:05 - to have a recurring stream of income
06:07 - from clients you'll understand how
06:09 - referrals work you'll be improving so
06:12 - much right these are essential skills
06:14 - that you'll later need when you try to
06:16 - freelance as a web developer so that's
06:19 - step 2 does that make sense hopefully
06:21 - that makes sense if it doesn't make
06:23 - sense comment below it doesn't make
06:24 - sense you're crazy but if it makes sense
06:25 - I want you to just do like a thumbs up
06:27 - or stand up in your chair I don't know
06:28 - do something so I know that it makes
06:30 - sense like this video okay do that step
06:34 - 3
06:34 - let's go with step 3 django web
06:37 - development okay that's the thirst
06:39 - so how does this work this step now that
06:45 - you're actually earning an income from
06:46 - coding you have room to breathe and you
06:49 - have time that magically appeared that
06:52 - didn't exist before
06:54 - so now you're gonna use that time to
06:56 - actually learn web development in Python
06:59 - the framework that I recommend using is
07:01 - Django why because it comes with an
07:05 - administrator interface built in and it
07:08 - kicks every other frameworks ass okay no
07:11 - chess and all those JavaScript
07:13 - frameworks are really awesome and really
07:14 - great but if you're working with a
07:16 - client and need to get them results
07:17 - really fast you can save ten hundred
07:20 - plus hours by just having an
07:23 - administrator interface kind of built
07:25 - from scratch and that's what this allows
07:26 - you to do okay meaning like
07:28 - functionalities to log in log out have
07:30 - basic database have your client give
07:32 - your client the ability to like delete
07:34 - stuff add stuff and all that okay and
07:36 - handle user permissions it kind of comes
07:38 - magically built in with Django from
07:41 - scratch so that's really really powerful
07:43 - and I remember Chris Hawkes actually
07:45 - mentioning this as well so I actually
07:47 - got that from there so thank you for
07:49 - that Chris Hawkes got it so far so good
07:53 - it's making sense this is where you're
07:56 - gonna actually take most of the time
07:57 - because this is the hardest part you're
07:59 - going to develop these skills you're
08:01 - gonna build projects you're gonna put
08:02 - those projects on your portfolio okay
08:05 - and after you have experienced building
08:08 - projects in this working in this and
08:10 - coaching other people okay you can even
08:12 - coach other people on Django okay and
08:14 - help them once you have this experience
08:16 - and you're earning an income from coding
08:18 - you're gonna go on to the final phase
08:21 - which I like to call the trusted advisor
08:23 - because I hate the word freelancer
08:27 - all right freelancers to me it just
08:30 - sounds like a commodity thing you're an
08:32 - expense okay but what you want your
08:35 - clients to see us no matter when you
08:37 - become a freelancer no matter what you
08:39 - become a freelance friend okay whether
08:40 - it's coding photography or anything else
08:42 - when you actually get to that level how
08:46 - you stand down from the rest of the
08:47 - crowd is everybody seeing you as a
08:49 - trusted advisor if you can demonstrate
08:52 - your
08:52 - value to your prospective client okay if
08:56 - you come off as an expense you're not
08:59 - gonna get hired the only way you can get
09:02 - hired is by being a lower expense
09:04 - meaning they'll hire somebody who'll
09:06 - price themselves lower than you okay so
09:09 - you have to compete on pricing but if
09:11 - you can demonstrate your value to your
09:13 - potential client and you can show them
09:15 - that you're actually an investment that
09:17 - can actually help them increase their
09:18 - ROI then they're much more likely to
09:22 - work with you and pay you more
09:23 - rather than anybody else does that make
09:26 - sense so that's why trusted adviser
09:30 - consultant that's what you're gonna aim
09:32 - to be not a freelancer I don't like that
09:37 - term but I just have to use it because
09:39 - it's just the easiest way to say
09:41 - somebody who works with clients does
09:44 - this make sense guys force that process
09:46 - simple not easy requires hard work but I
09:50 - mean coding is fun as hell right you
09:52 - take your ideas build something in real
09:54 - life share it with the rest of the world
09:56 - so you're making a deep impact in the
09:58 - world as you're doing all this stuff so
10:00 - not only it's not an only important for
10:02 - money but the reason why I have to
10:05 - mention money and practicality which no
10:07 - other developers do okay it's because
10:11 - you might have a family right now so not
10:15 - only do you have to take care of
10:16 - yourself but you actually might have to
10:17 - take care of the people that are nearby
10:20 - you your family members okay and I want
10:23 - you to live a comfortable lifestyle as
10:25 - well there's no pride in poverty okay
10:28 - there's no pride in that and that's why
10:30 - this channel me I always talk about
10:32 - practicality of practicality like learn
10:35 - stuff and then earn an income with it
10:37 - right and even grant cardone I was
10:39 - watching his 10x growth con and he says
10:42 - idea to monetization get there fast as
10:45 - possible because if you don't have money
10:47 - monetization ideas die okay your dreams
10:51 - die it's like the life blood and oxygen
10:53 - for what you're trying to do you're a
10:54 - good person you have great intentions
10:56 - but if you're not earning an income from
10:58 - it and you're you're you are barely able
11:00 - to survive I doubt they're gonna
11:02 - actually keep doing something right and
11:04 - that's why actually most of the
11:06 - people who start this journey quit
11:08 - because the only thing that they're
11:09 - taught is learn coding then learn web
11:12 - development and then just apply to lots
11:14 - of places cross your fingers and maybe
11:16 - hopefully one day you'll get a job
11:19 - that's a very tough route there's a lot
11:21 - of uncertainty I don't want to take that
11:23 - route I think you don't want to take
11:25 - that route okay now that I've shown you
11:27 - all this I do want to mention that my
11:29 - course the profitable programmer I only
11:32 - launched it like four to six months okay
11:35 - so the last time I launched it was in
11:36 - November and then I closed the doors for
11:38 - it and actually I've launched it now and
11:41 - the doors are open to enroll in that
11:43 - course but there are two days left that
11:45 - course literally takes you from a
11:47 - complete beginner all the way to this
11:49 - trusted advisor that's the goal of that
11:51 - course if you're a django web developer
11:54 - then great your steps are now shorter
11:56 - all you have to do is go from here to
11:58 - becoming a trusted advisor okay if you
12:00 - already know coding great I'll show you
12:02 - how to coach and earn an income from it
12:04 - then I'll show you django web
12:05 - development then I'll show you how to
12:06 - become that trusted advisor consultant
12:08 - people will pay what you're worth and
12:10 - not nickel and dime you cool and my
12:15 - awesome freaking webinar is coming okay
12:17 - so for those of you who want to learn
12:18 - more how to specifically become a Python
