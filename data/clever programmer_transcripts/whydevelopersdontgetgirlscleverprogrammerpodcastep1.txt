00:00 - - Hey guys!
00:01 - What's up?
00:02 - Today I'm here with whatsdev.
00:03 - Without any further ado,
let's jump right into it.
00:09 - This could be our podcast opener, dude.
00:12 - - I like it!
00:15 - - What's up, this is Qazi here,
00:16 - from cleverprogrammer.com.
00:18 - Today here with...
00:20 - - Tenzin from whatsdev.
00:21 - - That's right, and we are here with...
00:23 - - Aaron.
00:24 - You guys know me.
00:25 - - Yeah. Aaron is the man on
the Clever Programmer channel.
00:30 - This is the first episode of,
00:32 - what should we call it?
00:34 - The Qazi show!
00:36 - - The Profitable Podcast.
00:37 - - The Profitable Programmer Show!
00:39 - (laughing)
00:40 - Oh that's actually good.
00:41 - The Profitable Programmer Show!
00:43 - Welcome, everybody.
00:44 - We're gonna start off with talking about
00:47 - why developers don't get girls.
00:50 - And then from there,
we're gonna transition
00:52 - into a lot more things.
00:53 - So this is gonna be
probably one of the most
00:54 - authentic, transparent, and rawest shit
00:57 - that you guys have seen on this channel.
00:59 - So if you're under 18,
you should probably leave.
01:02 - But, if you
01:03 - - It might get too raw, though.
01:04 - - Yeah.
01:05 - But if you're over 18 an you're excited,
01:07 - let's jump right into it.
01:10 - So, and he's Tenzin
from whatsdev, you know.
01:12 - I don't know if you guys know that.
01:13 - - Take it easy.
01:14 - - Because he's been off
the map a little bit.
01:15 - But!
01:16 - This guy just opened up his
new YouTube channel called-
01:18 - - Yeah, I got my first
subscriber yesterday.
01:19 - - [Tenzin] Did you?
01:21 - - Yeah.
01:22 - - This guy started a YouTube
channel for everybody.
01:24 - - Yeah.
01:24 - - Pretty much, that's
how you started right?
01:26 - - Pretty much.
01:27 - - Yeah, yeah.
01:28 - - Peer pressure.
01:29 - - Peer pressure is everything.
01:30 - But yours is called, what is it called?
01:31 - - Clever Programmer Aaron.
01:33 - - Nice.
01:34 - - So it's kind of a branch
of Clever Programmer,
01:36 - it's not my own own yet.
01:36 - - Fucking RSD.
01:39 - CP Aaron.
01:39 - - Not CP Aaron, Clever Programmer Aaron.
01:41 - - All right, yeah, yeah.
01:42 - - But CP Aaron for short.
01:44 - - Nice bro.
01:44 - I like Clever Programmer Aaron.
01:46 - That's good.
01:47 - So, you just came over here from Chicago,
01:50 - how was your trip?
01:51 - - Good.
01:52 - - How was your trip?
01:53 - - It's pretty long, you know.
01:55 - - [Aaron] Any earthquakes on the plane?
01:57 - - No earthquakes.
01:58 - Little turbulence on the
plane, but no earthquakes.
02:01 - It was pretty good, dude.
02:02 - - Yeah?
02:03 - - It was a long flight, you know?
02:05 - - Yeah?
02:06 - - Slept a little.
02:08 - Wrote a little.
02:09 - - Really?
02:10 - - Yeah.
02:11 - - What'd you write?
02:12 - - About my Uber driver today.
02:13 - - Wait.
02:14 - - I took my Lyft to the
airport, and turns out
02:18 - my Lyft driver is a fucking trader.
02:22 - - Like a day trader or what?
02:24 - - Yeah.
02:25 - And you know what he said?
02:25 - You know what he fucking said?
02:27 - - Enlighten us Tenzin.
02:28 - - Yeah seriously, I'm curious now.
02:33 - - He said he drives Lyfts for fun.
02:35 - Lyft for fun.
02:36 - - Yup.
02:37 - I've heard this actually.
02:38 - - Out of boredom.
02:39 - - I've actually heard this
from quite a few people.
02:42 - Like Mustafa, remember?
02:44 - He had a, not a developer.
02:47 - - Holy shit.
02:48 - (laughing)
02:49 - - I was just throwing that in there.
02:51 - - Teamwork, baby!
02:52 - - Put captions on this shit.
02:55 - (laughing)
02:57 - - The Rev will be going crazy.
02:59 - - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
03:00 - - But he got in an Uber
actually with this guy who
03:03 - was like a multi-millionaire.
03:06 - At least the guy claimed he was.
03:08 - And Mustafa was like, "Why
are you doing this, dude?"
03:10 - - Big fan, bro, big fan.
03:11 - - Yeah, he's like, "Big fan,"
03:13 - he's like, "Why are you doing this?"
03:14 - and then it turns out that that guy was
03:17 - driving the Uber purely
because he has so much money,
03:20 - he's like a trust fund person almost.
03:22 - He was old, but, he goes, "I just do this
03:25 - to meet fascinating people."
03:28 - - I mean, that's the best way to do it.
03:31 - You literally get to have
a one on one interaction
03:33 - with like 5-20 people a day.
03:35 - - Dude.
03:36 - - By choice.
03:37 - - That's being very conservative.
03:39 - - And dude, think about it.
03:41 - Everybody that you're meeting is actually
03:43 - a person who has money,
right, like guaranteed.
03:47 - And they have to be
thinking at a certain level
03:50 - to take an Uber,
03:52 - so everybody who's getting in,
03:54 - I just feel like it's doing
something in their lives.
03:56 - You know what I mean?
03:57 - - Or they're shitfaced and
their friend bought it for them.
03:59 - - Yeah, I mean, that could be it too.
04:01 - But I feel like,
- Also fine.
04:04 - - I don't know, but I
feel like it's a pretty
04:05 - fascinating way to build
connections with people.
04:09 - - It is.
04:10 - - You know?
04:11 - Because everybody, even
people who are goofy as hell,
04:13 - they'll know people.
04:15 - You know?
04:16 - I don't know, if I were
to become a developer
04:19 - all over again, I'd start driving Uber
04:21 - and build relationships with everyone.
04:22 - - I mean I'm thinking.
04:23 - - Right?
04:24 - - Making money listening
to coding podcasts.
04:26 - - Somebody should make a show.
04:28 - somebody should make a show.
04:29 - - What was the coding podcast we used to
04:30 - listen to in the beginning?
04:31 - - Programming Throwdown.
04:32 - - Oh my god.
04:33 - - That was good, dude.
04:34 - - Programming Throwdown.
04:35 - - I'm not on your guys' level.
04:37 - I don't know, what is that?
04:38 - - I don't even know if they exist.
04:39 - - Pull it up, pull it up, and maybe
04:40 - we can talk about another podcast.
04:41 - - Do they even still exist?
04:42 - - Like with the reincarnation of it.
04:43 - - All right, so it's called
Programming Throwdown.
04:46 - - I think it's still there.
04:47 - - We can be like, Programming Throw Up.
04:48 - - [Qazi] Yeah, it's got
a lot of ratings, 4.6.
04:50 - - [Tenzin] June 19th,
Functional Programming,
04:50 - they're still going, baby!
04:51 - I love Functional Programming!
04:53 - - [Qazi] They drop
something every week, dude.
04:57 - Or every month, at least.
04:58 - They're very...
05:00 - - Typescript.
05:01 - Image processing.
05:02 - - I mean, I don't know man.
05:03 - January 15th and March 4th.
05:04 - That doesn't seem like
they're dropping every,
05:06 - I don't know.
05:07 - You guys are dropping
the ball, it seems like.
05:09 - Somebody tagged them,
let's make them see this.
05:12 - - I mean, it has 460 ratings.
05:13 - - You know what's crazy
is when I used to listen
05:15 - to them, we didn't even have a platform.
05:17 - Now our platform's totally
bigger than theirs.
05:19 - (laughs)
05:20 - That's pretty fascinating.
05:21 - - 460 reviews.
05:23 - - Maybe they'll reach out to us and we can
05:24 - get them on the podcast!
05:25 - Dude, that'd be like our dreams come true!
05:28 - - That would be pretty cool.
05:29 - - They're actually really cool,
05:30 - so actually let me just play a part of it.
05:32 - - [Podcast] Hey, I'm Jason Gauci.
05:34 - - Oh, shit!
05:38 - - You feel out of the loop, Frankie?
05:39 - I feel out of the loop.
05:41 - - We can just turn up to this, yo!
05:44 - - Yeah, I remember this shit, bro.
05:46 - It's like-
05:47 - [Podcast] Programming
Throwdown Episode 91.
05:49 - - This takes me back in the day.
05:49 - - [Podcast] Take it away, Jason.
05:53 - - [Jason] Hey everyone, so
we got a lot of feedback
05:56 - on our interview with __
06:00 - - There's something about it, dude,
06:01 - I just love listening to the-
06:02 - - It's like, chill.
06:03 - Chill and--
06:04 - - Yo, we need an intro song.
06:05 - That's what we need.
06:05 - - That's true.
06:06 - For this one?
06:08 - - For the show.
06:09 - Every time we have a,
06:10 - We need an intro like they do.
06:11 - Every podcast has an intro.
06:12 - - Like an intro, yeah.
06:13 - For YouTube, podcast, whatever.
06:16 - - [Aaron] Welcome to the
Clever Programmer Podcast.
06:18 - - That music right there, bro.
06:19 - - Which one?
06:20 - - The Clever Programmer Podcast.
06:21 - CPP.
06:22 - - The music.
06:23 - - Which one?
06:24 - - That we found.
06:25 - - Oh, on epidemic sounds?
06:25 - Okay, hold on.
06:27 - Oh, dude, that is sick!
06:28 - Yo, that is sick!
06:29 - - Oh my god.
06:30 - You can even see the size!
06:31 - - That is crazy.
06:33 - So guaranteed you know
this shit's working.
06:36 - Okay, let me-
06:38 - - That's insane, bro.
06:39 - - That is actually pretty insane, bro.
06:41 - - It even has a, oh my god.
06:42 - - Let me go on epidemic-
06:44 - - You had so many times just fricking not-
06:45 - Like, your thing is on but it's not on,
06:47 - and after 2 hours of hard work.
06:49 - - Yeah, yeah, yeah, recording.
06:51 - - Sweat's coming out,
and then you're like,
06:53 - oh fuck I forgot the cord.
06:54 - - Like you'll be thinking
you're screen recording
06:56 - a tutorial for coding, for developers,
06:59 - and then all of a sudden you'll look,
07:00 - and it's not even
recording for developers.
07:03 - - Or it doesn't save or some shit.
07:04 - - I'm just maximizing it, bro.
07:07 - Trying to make this podcast
as relevant as possible.
07:12 - Dude, where is it?
07:13 - So I have like right in the feels section.
07:16 - (piano music)
07:20 - - No, no.
07:21 - - So this shouldn't be the opener, right?
07:22 - - What the fuck, dude?
- Is this a joke?
07:24 - All right how about this?
07:26 - - You should pick a few and
let 'em choose for episode 2.
07:28 - Like the viewers of episode
one should choose it.
07:30 - - Yeah, what was the last one?
07:31 - Last one, last one.
07:32 - - Okay, how about this?
07:33 - Hold on, hold on.
07:34 - How about this as our opener?
07:36 - Hey guys, what's up?
07:37 - Today I'm here with whatsdev.
07:39 - Without any further ado,
let's jump right into it.
07:45 - This could be our podcast opener, dude.
07:47 - - I like it.
07:48 - - All right, let's try another one.
07:50 - Let's let the people choose as well.
07:51 - If you like this one, drop that timestamp.
07:53 - - Number one, number one.
07:54 - - That's number one.
07:55 - Okay, we got another one.
07:57 - All of these have the same formula.
07:59 - See this one, that's my favorite.
08:01 - - No, not this one.
08:03 - Let me hear the drop.
08:04 - - Just give it-
08:05 - - We can skip to it next time, yeah.
08:14 - - This shit's lit, dude.
08:15 - - It's lit, but not for a podcast.
08:16 - - Yeah, it doesn't feel right.
08:19 - - It's very-
08:20 - - [Aaron] It's too dark.
08:21 - - It's almost monotonous.
08:22 - It's not monotonous, but it's
just the same beat, you know?
08:25 - The rhythm doesn't change.
08:26 - Not a lot of-
08:28 - - Variation.
08:29 - There's not enough pizazz or spice there.
08:31 - - Exactly.
08:32 - - Let me see if I can find-
08:33 - - Spice.
08:34 - We like it spicy, baby.
08:35 - Damn, this guy talking about
pizazz and weird shit, dude.
08:37 - Pizazz.
08:39 - - We're talking about spices, dog.
08:41 - - Hold on, let me go to...
08:44 - I think I made a...
08:45 - Oh, no, I made epic music.
08:48 - I think it should be in here.
08:54 - What's up guys?
08:55 - - Ooh!
08:55 - This is it!
08:56 - This is it!
08:57 - - This is pretty good.
08:59 - But we gotta change our
voice to it, be like-
09:02 - - Hey welcome to the
podcast you guys, episode 2.
09:03 - - Hey, what's up guys, how's it going?
09:05 - This is Qazi.
09:06 - I'm here today with-
09:07 - - Does it drop?
09:08 - Aaron.
09:09 - - Aaron Bernath, and?
09:11 - - Tenzin, from whatsdev.com!
09:13 - - Let's get right into it.
09:15 - I think that this needs
a little bit of that.
09:17 - - All right.
09:20 - - So you guys can vote, they can vote.
09:21 - - All right.
09:23 - - Every episode, a different one, dude.
09:26 - Everyone's happy, I found the solution.
09:28 - - I think we'll just play it from here.
09:31 - Yeah.
09:32 - All right now let's get
to the main topic, boys.
09:35 - Why don't developers get girls?
09:38 - - I got dumped.
09:40 - (laughing)
09:43 - - Oh, Kayla.
09:45 - - Oh shit, you fucking dropped the name.
09:47 - - She might actually look at this.
09:48 - - I don't know man, you tell me.
09:50 - What do you think?
09:52 - - I mean, Aaron is the expert here.
09:54 - (laughing)
09:58 - - I don't know why I
laughed, I didn't get it.
10:00 - But it was pretty funny, yeah?
10:01 - - It was pretty funny.
10:03 - - You can probably get the
gist of it, the context.
10:05 - - No dude, I think I feel like
10:09 - they don't really connect with
people that much, you know?
10:13 - What do you think it is?
10:17 - - I mean, I can actually
talk from fucking experience.
10:18 - - All right, all right talk to me.
10:19 - What do you think it is?
10:21 - Why do you think it's the case?
10:22 - - Well, she's not gonna
fucking watch this, but-
10:26 - (laughing)
10:28 - she never gave me a reason,
so I actually don't know why,
10:31 - but I just have theories.
10:32 - I was kind of a loser back then,
10:34 - staying up all night playing video games.
10:36 - - This shit just got real.
10:38 - - You know, not talking to anybody,
10:40 - I only hang out with her.
10:41 - I didn't see any of my friends,
10:42 - I wasn't doing anything with my life
10:43 - except going to school.
10:44 - - Right.
10:45 - - So it's like, just
being kind of a loser.
10:47 - She didn't even know why, she probably
10:48 - just picked up on that low energy and
10:50 - that kind of social awkwardness
that I used to have.
10:54 - And then probably in general
terms, that's pretty much it.
10:58 - You go through so many variations,
11:00 - you go down different
personalities and whatnot.
11:02 - But pretty much is just
a lack of outgoingness,
11:05 - ambition, you're kind of huddled down,
11:07 - you're a hermit, staying up all night,
11:09 - you forget to shower, whatever.
11:10 - Playing games, other things.
11:15 - - But don't you feel like the
complacency was encouraged
11:18 - in your relationship and then that
11:19 - ended up being the downfall of it?
11:22 - What do you think about-
11:26 - - Wasn't this supposed to
be my first YouTube video?
11:27 - We were supposed to talk
about fucking breakups my
11:28 - first YouTube video.
11:29 - - Hey, that's great, that's great.
11:31 - This is not your first
YouTube video, dude.
11:33 - - This is an ongoing joke,
this is an ongoing joke.
11:35 - - Yeah, this is ongoing.
11:36 - - Yeah, I think it was, yeah.
11:37 - I just wasn't ready, like just too young.
11:39 - Not ready for a serious relationship
11:40 - even though I thought I was.
11:41 - But even beyond that, if I
didn't have a girlfriend,
11:44 - I'd be in the same shit.
11:45 - - [Tenzin] How old are you right now?
11:46 - - I'm 24.
11:46 - - How old were you when that happened?
11:48 - - I'm 24, baby.
11:49 - - I just turned 23 like a month before-
11:51 - - 3 days for my birthday, come
on let's get it, gang shit.
11:53 - - So it's been like a year and a half,
11:54 - over a year and a half,
so I'm long over it.
11:59 - - I don't know, what are
your thoughts on this?
12:01 - - I think not just developers,
but most people suck
12:04 - at dating and relationships,
and they don't get girls.
12:08 - Girls.
12:08 - because you know everybody wants 10 or 9.
12:12 - But I think most people
suck because they just
12:14 - don't work on it.
12:16 - They think it's just like a natural skill.
12:19 - I don't even know what natural means,
12:20 - but most people use that, and it's like...
12:24 - You gotta learn that.
12:26 - You have to go through rejections
12:27 - and people don't wanna do it.
12:30 - And ultimately I think it comes down to
12:32 - just being okay with
rejections, and most people
12:35 - are not okay with rejections.
12:37 - And not just males.
12:40 - - The incessant texting and phone calls
12:43 - versus face-to-face interaction too,
12:44 - the ratio was way off.
12:46 - I would see her once or twice a week,
12:48 - but we'd text everyday for four hours.
12:49 - - Jesus.
12:51 - That's so much content.
12:53 - You know how engaged
your audience would be
12:55 - if you spent 4 hours messaging them back?
12:57 - - Nurturing each other
for 4 hours everyday!
13:02 - - Well it wasn't like a 4 hour chunk.
13:04 - You were focused on the cater,
13:06 - you weren't focused on
the custom reposition,
13:08 - you were focused on the LTV, baby.
13:10 - - Something like that.
- Long term game.
13:12 - - Life time value.
- Long term game, you know.
13:13 - - Life time vagina.
13:15 - (giggling)
13:17 - - Something like that.
13:19 - - I don't know where she is now.
13:21 - - So, I don't know I have
mixed feelings on it but-
13:24 - - What are your thoughts?
13:25 - - I wanna go back to your point.
13:26 - I think I agree with that you
say people attach their...
13:31 - Most men attach their
ego to things like girls.
13:33 - Like most men think they
should just be good at girls.
13:37 - - They think they are good with girls.
13:39 - - Right.
13:40 - And it hurts their ego otherwise.
13:41 - Just like most men think
their good at fighting.
13:44 - - Exactly.
13:45 - - Nobody can throw a punch for shit.
13:47 - We learned it.
13:48 - - Not even a jab.
13:49 - - We learned it by getting
our asses kicked, right?
13:50 - - Exactly.
13:52 - In boxing, jiujitsu, whatever have you.
13:54 - And people also then bring
that over to thinking
13:57 - that they should naturally
be good at getting clients.
14:02 - You know what I'm saying?
14:03 - People bring that in into everything
14:06 - without actually practicing and making it.
14:08 - I think people suck, like
developers especially
14:11 - suck with girls.
14:13 - Because most of them are introverted,
14:15 - and they think they should be good.
14:17 - - And it's so easy to huddle
down in front of computers,
14:20 - because the players there-
14:21 - - Because they've been fucking told
14:22 - that if you get a degree,
and you go to college,
14:24 - you're not only gonna
get unlimited bitches,
14:28 - you're also gonna get jobs
14:30 - and you'll never run out of them.
14:32 - And they think that once
they get the degree that
14:35 - everything will just happen by itself.
14:37 - - Didn't happen.
14:40 - Didn't happen like that.
14:42 - - It doesn't.
14:43 - I don't think it ever does, right?
14:44 - - Do you have your degree?
14:46 - Did you graduate or did you
drop out too, like that.
14:48 - - Come on, dude.
14:50 - I was the fucking leader.
14:52 - I was in the fucking...
14:53 - I'm like shit, I don't give a fuck.
14:56 - I was looking at them, I'm like,
14:59 - "Pretty good, dude, pretty good.
15:02 - Peace."
15:04 - - You were the official
person who was getting
15:08 - all of your friends
around you, including me,
15:10 - to quit college, right?
15:12 - - Oh, you were the catalyst.
15:13 - I thought it was you all this time.
15:14 - - But I'll take credit
for getting my friends to
15:16 - quit jobs around me.
15:20 - - What did I do?
15:21 - Nothing.
15:23 - - Well you didn't quit college.
15:26 - But that's okay because
he's using it very-
15:28 - - You don't have to quit
college, it's not like,
15:30 - oh, you have to quit college.
15:32 - It's nothing like that.
15:34 - - No, but the problem is that most people
15:35 - just make it their everything.
15:36 - They don't actually spend
any time coding on their own.
15:39 - They don't spend going
out trying to get clients.
15:41 - They just make it everything.
15:42 - - That was me, listening to my parents.
15:44 - - They'll find one
girlfriend in their life and
15:45 - then just hold on to her
for the rest of their lives.
15:47 - - Exactly, it's kind of
getting lucky, to be honest.
15:52 - But, hot asian.
15:54 - - Oh man, yeah.
15:57 - I feel like it's bad to
actually get one of your
16:00 - first girlfriends to be way hotter,
16:03 - like out of your league.
16:04 - - They were both hot.
16:05 - I had 2 long term, 4 years back to back.
16:08 - - I think that's actually a disadvantage.
16:09 - That's like a kid who gets a
trust fund from his parents
16:12 - and now nothing he can-
16:14 - - They don't know the
hard way and then when
16:16 - that girlfriend dumps him, and
eventually she will dump him,
16:20 - because that's just how life works,
16:24 - he doesn't know what to do.
16:27 - - That's where I was, but it ended up
16:28 - being the best thing
that ever happened to me.
16:31 - Changed my life.
16:32 - - What? Breakup?
16:33 - Oh, breakups are always the best.
16:34 - - They're the best, man.
16:35 - - Always the best.
16:36 - This guy, my friends, and me.
16:38 - Everybody starts changing when they're
16:40 - broke up and moved on.
16:42 - - I put on 45 pounds, I
started going to nightclubs.
16:44 - I went to fucking EDC.
16:46 - - Just to provide context,
he put good 45 pounds on
16:48 - because he was skinny like me,
16:49 - so he needed to put on weight.
16:51 - - More skinny than you.
16:52 - - And after he broke up, he started
16:52 - putting on weight and he got jacked.
16:54 - - How much do you weigh now?
16:55 - - I'm like 150.
16:55 - I was 172 a year ago.
16:57 - But I lost it when I moved
here because I was learning
17:00 - a lot of business stuff and I
kind of fell off my calories.
17:03 - - We were grinding bro.
17:06 - - Bro, how close are we to 1 mil?
17:08 - - Pretty fucking close, dude.
17:09 - - I saw 970?
17:11 - - 970, we're very close.
17:12 - - I mean let's be honest
it's already over that.
17:14 - YouTube ads baby, come on man.
17:15 - - Hopefully July we're
hitting our first mil.
17:19 - I'm really excited about that.
17:20 - - Camera guy Frankie back here,
17:21 - we couldn't do things without him.
17:24 - - And I know somebody in the comments is
17:25 - gonna be like, "Oh my god,
they're making so much money."
17:28 - We have zero profit, because
we reinvest into this business.
17:33 - Into those lights in the
background and into the team.
17:36 - I don't know why but that
will make people happy,
17:38 - like I know that.
17:39 - Saying that we have zero
profit, which is true,
17:41 - which is actually true.
17:43 - - You've made 960 thousand,
and you've spent 960 thousand.
17:45 - - Right, like all of it
on Clever Programmer,
17:46 - it just makes everyone happy.
17:47 - Like there's a few things
that just make people
17:49 - really happy when they hear them.
17:51 - I never really understand,
but there's a general
17:53 - consensus that's like,
"Oh, that's amazing."
17:58 - - People just like seeing
people on YouTube lose.
18:02 - - I think so.
18:03 - - They see GaryVee, they
complain about GaryVee.
18:06 - They see Grant Cardone, they
complain about Grant Cardone.
18:09 - Ty Lopez.
18:11 - They complain about everybody.
18:14 - And then when they fuck up-
18:15 - - Then any person who
tells them it's possible,
18:18 - they're like, "Oh, that's a scam."
18:19 - But anybody who tells
them it's not possible,
18:21 - that it's insanely hard,
18:22 - that you need like four
degrees to even go take a piss,
18:26 - they're like, "That's the truth."
18:33 - You know, so.
18:34 - - I was one of those skeptical people,
18:35 - even to this day sometimes I don't know.
18:38 - Like I know the work-
18:39 - - Oh, you wanna talk skeptical, baby?
18:42 - This guy was fucking-
18:44 - - The biggest skeptic ever.
18:46 - - Humongous.
18:48 - Gargantuan.
18:49 - Fucking truck driver.
18:52 - I was telling him about
marketing, SEO, and Ramit Sethi.
18:58 - Okay, Ramit Sethi.
18:59 - If you guys don't know who Ramit Sethi is,
19:01 - you guys should definitely follow him.
19:03 - - Exactly, it's his uncle.
19:07 - - We're not fucking kidding,
it's actually his uncle.
19:08 - - I told this guy for
two and a half years-
19:10 - - Guys, somebody's gonna ask
me, "Are you both Indian?"
19:12 - Somebody's gonna ask me.
19:13 - - Two and a half years, I'm like,
19:14 - "Dude, that's the guy, bro."
19:16 - - [Aaron] Yeah, that's the
guy you wanna link up with.
19:21 - - And then one day all
of a sudden, he's like,
19:24 - "Dude, you know, this guy's pretty good."
19:27 - - Yeah.
19:28 - - I don't remember if
you said that but I just
19:30 - assumed it went something like that.
19:32 - - And now 970 thousand dollars later.
19:35 - - Exactly.
19:36 - - Thanks to this Chinese guy.
19:38 - Chinese?
19:38 - Korean?
19:39 - Asian?
19:40 - - It doesn't matter, dude.
19:41 - - You told me about
Ramit Sethi and I didn't-
19:43 - - I didn't believe that
Ramit Sethi because
19:44 - you know I was in the same boat as people
19:45 - because I hadn't made a dollar online.
19:47 - And so I believed everybody who taught
19:49 - about making money online was a scam.
19:51 - So I thought Ramit Sethi was not real.
19:55 - I thought Neil Patel was like, hoax.
19:58 - I thought Pat Flynn was all
like, talk, and nothing real.
20:02 - For no reason, literally just because
20:05 - they talked about money, I
thought that they were fake.
20:08 - - Right.
20:09 - - And that's precisely
the reason why developers
20:13 - or most guys don't get girls too.
20:15 - Because there are videos online.
20:18 - RSD, right?
20:19 - RSD videos.
20:20 - Ton of videos online
showing how to get girls,
20:25 - how it's actually done.
20:26 - Not all that woo woo shit.
20:30 - - Be calm, be nice.
20:32 - - Be confident
20:33 - - Open doors.
20:34 - - Be nice.
20:35 - Like empty surface level..
20:37 - What happened?
20:38 - - No, no, no, not you.
20:39 - It's an inside joke, we burn him with it.
20:41 - We call him Woo Woo Master all the time.
20:42 - Just trying to get under his skin.
20:44 - Because he does meditation stuff so
20:46 - we keep burning him on it.
20:47 - Today he almost cracked.
20:50 - (laughs)
20:53 - That's Frankie everybody,
behind the camera.
20:55 - - This guy's untriggerable.
20:56 - - He's working way too hard there, bro.
20:59 - - He's very resilient.
21:01 - - [Frankie] I got good practice.
21:04 - - You use your left hand-
21:05 - - He got jokes!
21:07 - What?
21:09 - He's funnier than us, he
should be fucking running this.
21:11 - I should be behind that camera.
21:12 - - Yeah.
21:13 - - Fuck, Aaron.
21:16 - I think, one is yes,
21:19 - you can just look up how
to get good with girls.
21:21 - Like literally, and study it.
21:23 - Take away all your ego, put it aside,
21:25 - take it in a little box, throw it away.
21:27 - If you don't have results with girls,
21:29 - you need to study it, and
learn it, and then practice it.
21:32 - If you don't get results getting clients,
21:35 - you have to study it,
learn it, and practice it.
21:39 - Most people, they spend
all their time just
21:41 - educating themselves, and
then they're just like,
21:43 - "I'm not getting a job.
21:44 - I'm not getting a job."
21:46 - - We've all been there.
21:48 - We've all been there at some point.
21:49 - - Right.
21:50 - - But you gotta work on
getting a job, you know?
21:52 - - I stopped being there
at the age of like 16 bro,
21:54 - because I worked my ass
off trying to figure out
21:57 - how to get jobs.
21:58 - I know you did too, from a very young age,
22:00 - you were hustling and like-
22:04 - - One hundred percent
I have more jobs than
22:05 - every one of you combined.
22:07 - Combined.
22:07 - - You have done more different jobs than
22:09 - every one of us combined.
22:10 - - I would quit jobs like this.
22:11 - Three months, I can't do it.
22:13 - It's just not me.
22:16 - New job, better job.
22:17 - - This guy got a job-
22:18 - - His fucking turn rate was like, what?
22:20 - - This guy got a job as a developer,
22:21 - he quit like fucking weeks later.
22:23 - - As a developer?
22:24 - How much were you getting paid?
22:25 - - 5 days.
22:26 - - 5 days later, bro.
22:27 - - Did you get paid for the 5 days?
22:27 - - I don't know.
22:28 - - He quit right after
the 5 days he got it.
22:32 - - It just wasn't for you?
22:34 - What are you doing now?
22:35 - I know you have your whatsdev channel.
22:37 - Is that bringing you?
22:37 - - Same thing.
22:39 - - Yeah.
22:40 - - He went through his launch.
22:41 - - I'm just 10 times left
active, but same thing.
22:46 - - But he literally has
so many less expenses so
22:49 - he's literally more profitable than us.
22:52 - - That is true.
22:53 - - Like, he has more money than me.
22:55 - - That is true.
22:56 - - And me.
22:56 - - Combined, all of us combined.
22:57 - - And Frankie.
22:59 - - Yeah, actually.
23:00 - All of us.
23:01 - Mom, if you're watching this, I love you.
23:03 - - Right.
23:05 - But, you know, I feel like if they just
23:08 - detach their ego from it, one.
23:10 - And two, just start going fucking out.
23:16 - Or is that too difficult?
23:18 - - That's difficult, bro.
23:20 - - It is, that's the worst-
23:22 - - He said it is!
23:23 - - It is, but that's the first step.
23:26 - - So wait, hold on, let me get this right.
23:30 - So I don't just after becoming
an insanely incredible
23:34 - Python or a JavaScript developer just get
23:36 - a line of girls just outside my door,
23:39 - and I need to install revolving doors?
23:41 - Is that what you're telling me, dude?
23:43 - - [Aaron] That's exactly-
23:45 - - What the fuck?
23:48 - That's unbelievable, dude.
23:51 - - That's exactly what I'm telling you.
23:55 - - So what do I need to do, man?
23:56 - You're the doctor.
23:58 - You're the love doctor here.
24:00 - - Always have condoms on you.
24:01 - - I got it.
24:02 - - Okay because there's too many girls.
24:05 - You gotta be safe.
24:06 - - Got it.
24:06 - - Mama always said you gotta be safe.
24:08 - - That's right.
24:09 - - And I listen to my mama.
24:10 - - My code is always-
24:11 - - You do as well.
24:12 - - My code is always safe.
24:13 - I write safe code.
24:14 - I make sure that when I'm
writing it in Jinja and Django-
24:18 - - Scalable.
24:19 - - I scape my html, so when somebody
24:22 - puts something in, they can't attack.
24:26 - I pass a safe filter.
24:28 - - I got you.
24:28 - - That's right.
24:29 - - Injections.
24:30 - - Injections, so the sequel injections.
24:33 - I'm safe against the
sequel injections, dude.
24:35 - I'm safe as fuck.
24:36 - - What if it's no sequel?
24:38 - - That's true, MongoDB
no sequel, I don't know,
24:40 - then you're starting to lose me.
24:42 - - Yeah, I actually don't
know much about databases.
24:44 - - That's all good, bro.
24:45 - - He knows about the real shit.
24:48 - - You don't even have
a YouTube channel, bro.
24:49 - - Yo, I got one subscriber!
24:51 - - Dude, this guy's super humble,
24:53 - but this guy knows about the real shit.
24:55 - He's like full on-
24:56 - - The fuck you mean, the real shit?
24:58 - - No this guy is like full
on CSE++ data structures.
25:01 - - I know, I see what you're
saying, he knows how to code.
25:02 - But like C++ is the real shit.
25:05 - I'm way past that, dude.
25:07 - Back then, I'm like, "Yeah
dude, C++, if you understand
25:10 - it bro, if you learn it, that's
the real programming, bro,
25:13 - that's real programming."
25:14 - - With pointers and references, oh my god.
25:15 - Assembly, inline, nippes
assembly or times 86?
25:21 - Coding Cobalt on my left
hand, Pascal on my right hand.
25:24 - (laughing)
25:25 - - Cobalt on my left
hand, Pascal on my right.
25:27 - Yeah, I don't know,
Brainfuck is where it's at.
25:32 - Whitespace.
25:33 - Have you ever looked into
Whitespace programming language?
25:35 - - I have not but I know
about the cooking language.
25:38 - - Well Chef, I know.
25:39 - There's Brainfuck, which is the hardest
25:42 - programming language on the planet.
25:43 - - Pull it up, pull it up.
25:44 - Pull it up.
25:46 - This is recording the screen, right?
25:48 - I've never heard of this, show me.
25:49 - - So Whitespace programming language
25:52 - is actually pretty nuts.
25:54 - - [Aaron] Don't google this
you guys, go out instead.
25:56 - - [Qazi] Seriously.
25:57 - So here's what some of the Whitespace
26:00 - programming language looks like.
26:02 - Right there.
26:03 - - [Aaron] That's why
it's called Whitespace?
26:05 - - [Qazi] Correct.
26:06 - - [Tenzin] They just did it for fun.
26:07 - - [Qazi] If you highlight-
26:08 - - They were so bored,
they're like, "You know what,
26:10 - let's create a programming
language out of nothing.
26:13 - Nothing!"
26:14 - - If you highlight it,
this is what it looks like.
26:16 - - So this is the first
general AI using Whitespace.
26:20 - I'd like to announce it to the world-
26:23 - - This is actually not Whitespace because
26:25 - there are lines going through,
there's too much code on it.
26:28 - - A little bit, it's
actually yellow space, so.
26:30 - - But look at this, this
is when it's highlighted.
26:32 - This is actually what it looks
like when you highlight it.
26:35 - And it's all based on how
many white spaces you have.
26:38 - - So each line is different character?
26:41 - - Each thing means different thing, right.
26:42 - - So it's literally like
coding one character-
26:43 - - Top programming.
26:45 - Top programming language of 2020.
26:47 - And moving forward.
26:48 - - You know what I wanna make?
26:49 - Top 5 worst programming languages of 2019.
26:52 - Nobody's made that.
26:54 - I feel like that would kill.
26:55 - - I saw one but yeah, not many do.
26:58 - - Right, but the one
you saw was that good?
27:01 - No, right?
27:02 - But if we made it-
27:03 - - I didn't see it but I'm
sure it's not that good.
27:04 - - We could make it pretty good, right?
27:06 - - Yeah, pretty good.
27:07 - - Okay, great.
27:08 - Then I won't make it.
27:10 - (laughs)
27:12 - I just need to know, if
we're gonna make it good
27:14 - then we don't need to
actually make it at all.
27:18 - Here's another esoteric
programming language.
27:21 - So this is that, here's Brainfuck.
27:24 - It looks a little bit like
this, it's pretty nuts.
27:27 - I mean, I will never understand-
27:29 - - [Aaron] No bro, that's Lisp.
27:30 - Have you not seen Lisp before?
27:31 - - No, it's way worse than Lisp.
27:32 - - Lisp is pretty cool.
27:33 - Lisp was pretty cool.
27:38 - - When we learned Scheme,
27:38 - isn't the Lisp actually
easier than Scheme, or was it?
27:41 - Or was it something else?
27:43 - - Scheme is almost like a subset of Lisp.
27:47 - Lisp is like, the full blown.
27:48 - - But I'm trying to remember...
27:49 - Closure we were trying to learn.
27:50 - And Closure actually had a little more
27:51 - functionality than Scheme.
27:53 - - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
27:53 - Don't listen to me.
27:54 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
27:55 - - When we were doing Scheme
and then we went to Closure,
27:57 - we were like, "Oh my god."
27:58 - for me, I felt like Closure
was so much easier than Scheme.
28:02 - Even though Closure is hard as fuck.
28:03 - But because we went through
that book, what was it?
28:07 - - Schemers, Little Schemers.
28:08 - - Little Schemers, right?
28:10 - - Once we went through
that book, Little Schemers,
28:12 - when we went to Closure,
that was actually a joke.
28:14 - - It's the best book out there.
28:15 - - It's the best.
28:16 - - That book was so good.
28:17 - - If you wanna go deep-
28:18 - - So good.
28:19 - - If you wanna become a
deeply great programmer,
28:21 - like deeply good, and just do
something for entertainment,
28:24 - I don't think it will help
you that much with projects,
28:26 - but recursion,
28:27 - you will understand the
shit out of recursion.
28:31 - All right, let me open up-
28:32 - - You will become one with recursion.
28:34 - - Little Schemers.
28:37 - - I don't even know what that accent was.
28:38 - - So here's the Little Schemers
with the little elephant
28:40 - hopping it up over here.
28:43 - You know honestly, when I
think about my first ex,
28:49 - like back in the day when I
was becoming a developer...
28:52 - - Is that your 7 year girlfriend?
28:54 - - That was a hard turn, baby.
28:56 - Didn't see that one coming.
28:58 - - That's right, that's what
the podcast needs to be,
28:59 - you know, just giving people ADHD,
29:01 - like they should just
not see anything coming.
29:03 - - The Logan Paul effect.
29:05 - - And I thought about it and I was like,
29:09 - man the 7 year long
relationship, you know.
29:11 - - Yeah, that's a long relationship.
29:12 - I mean, what's next, 10 years?
29:13 - Holy shit.
29:14 - - Right, that's crazy.
29:17 - And I was in that-
29:18 - (laughing)
29:20 - this guy just burned that guy because
29:21 - that guy's in a 10 year relationship.
29:23 - - He just got out of it.
29:24 - - But not really, he's
still kind of in it.
29:26 - - And if they ever meet in person then
29:29 - it's basically 11 years now.
29:31 - - We know what's gonna happen when they
29:32 - meet in person, right Frankie?
29:35 - But anyways, going back to the thing.
29:40 - I felt like I was becoming more and more
29:42 - introverted every day because I would just
29:43 - keep staying at home, and
keep staying with her.
29:47 - - Ding, ding, ding.
29:48 - - Right?
29:49 - And I was just becoming a
super lamer version of myself.
29:53 - Like the version she wanted me to be...
29:55 - She said she wanted me to be,
but at the end I found out
29:59 - that person was kind of like a loser,
30:01 - and she started to figure
out that person was a loser.
30:03 - And then it was just kind of crappy.
30:05 - - It's not the relationship,
30:08 - it's just you at the end of the day.
30:09 - It's just ourselves.
30:10 - And when we're not there, our
relationship's not gonna work,
30:13 - our business is not gonna work,
30:15 - we're not gonna learn programming
30:18 - and do anything successfully
because we're in that mindset,
30:21 - and we have a poor people mindset,
30:22 - and an unattractive people mindset,
30:25 - so we're gonna remain unattractive.
30:27 - - Yeah, I wasn't reading books.
30:28 - - All that, you know.
30:29 - - I didn't know anything.
30:30 - - The day we started reading books-
30:33 - - [Aaron] Yeah, I'm like 30 books in now.
30:34 - - We fucking changed.
30:35 - - Audible.com changed my life.
30:37 - - Our net worth, our potential
net worth was compounding.
30:44 - - Like crazy.
30:44 - - We sat on compounding interest.
30:46 - - That's actually a really
smart way to think about it.
30:49 - If there was a graph, and
let's say in our life,
30:52 - our potential net worth would just go on
30:54 - to be like this at the age of 65,
30:55 - after we started reading books,
30:57 - it started fucking going
like this dude, it's crazy.
30:59 - - And knowledge is just
that potential power,
31:01 - right, whoever said that.
31:04 - So it's like potential
net worth just goes up.
31:05 - - Until you execute on it,
so your potential goes up.
31:08 - - You execute it, it
becomes kinetic, you know.
31:10 - - And then execution is waiting on it.
31:12 - - Physics bro, I like this guy, shit.
31:15 - - Yeah, this guy's smarter
than he looks, too.
31:19 - - [Aaron] He dropped out of
college, he's fucking smart.
31:20 - - I look that dumb?
31:22 - Fuck man, fuck.
31:23 - - No, you just look that good, seriously.
31:26 - I tell this to my girlfriend too,
31:27 - all the time because she looks super hot.
31:28 - And so I'm like, "You're
smarter than you look, baby."
31:30 - She gets super offended, but I'm like,
31:32 - "It's literally because you look hotter."
31:36 - - Yeah, that's the issue.
31:37 - - That's the problem.
31:39 - Because she throws me off
with her intelligence.
31:40 - I never expect it.
31:43 - - That's the best kind of person.
31:44 - - Yeah, seriously.
31:47 - - Now that I think about it, yeah,
31:48 - she does look smarter than she looks.
31:50 - - That's right, she is
smarter than she looks.
31:51 - That's the thing.
31:52 - This guy, he's smarter than he acts.
31:56 - Because he's always acting goofy,
31:58 - but this motherfucker is smart.
31:59 - - That's getting a little deep but
32:00 - I'll pretend I understand you.
32:02 - - The first time he told me
that, I was dying laughing,
32:04 - because I was like, I love
that someone gets my identity.
32:06 - - Yeah, because he's really smart,
32:08 - but he always just acts goofy
and he plays around a lot.
32:11 - For example, just the other day,
32:13 - I've known him so much, right.
32:14 - For like 10 hours a day I've known him,
32:16 - for the last, like, 5 months.
32:18 - Like literally 10 hours a day.
32:19 - I know him more than I know my girlfriend.
32:22 - - Same.
32:23 - - There you go.
32:24 - And this guy, I just
found out, like last week,
32:26 - Frankie and I found out
that he's a drummer,
32:30 - and he's been drumming for 13 years.
32:34 - - When are we jamming?
32:35 - Let's go tomorrow to
the studio, let's jam.
32:37 - - All right.
32:38 - I'm not good at drumset,
32:39 - but like percussionist, like I can do-
32:40 - - Oh, okay, okay.
32:41 - - Like I can do different
kinds of drums and shit.
32:43 - - That's still pretty cool.
- Drumset I can kinda...
32:45 - - That's still pretty cool.
32:46 - - All kinds of drums and shit.
32:46 - Taiko drums.
32:47 - - Yeah.
32:48 - - I was in marching band!
32:49 - - I was pretty good at the real drums too,
32:51 - like the real drumset too.
32:52 - _ I could figure it out.
32:52 - - You know how I know he's really good?
32:55 - You know how I know he's really good?
32:56 - - Cause he doesn't talk about it?
32:58 - - He doesn't have one single piece
32:59 - of content online about it.
33:00 - (laughs)
33:02 - - That's how I know he's really good.
33:04 - Anybody who's really good,
33:05 - they're so judgmental they
never put out content.
33:08 - You always know they're the best!
33:10 - - Like that perfectionism-
33:11 - - That's right.
33:11 - - Comes out.
33:12 - - That's right.
33:13 - My girlfriend is incredible at boxing,
33:14 - she doesn't have a single-
33:15 - the one video she has-
33:16 - - She just has one view?
33:17 - - No, the one video
she had on her YouTube,
33:18 - she went two years later and deleted it.
33:20 - The one she had about boxing.
33:21 - - But now she has one?
33:22 - - Because of me.
33:23 - I posted it, you know.
33:24 - But she's a perfectionist.
33:26 - I'm not a perfectionist.
33:27 - I just posted something
that wasn't even that great,
33:29 - but I just put it out.
33:30 - - Right, right.
33:30 - That's why I love you, bro.
33:31 - - Yeah.
33:32 - - You're the balancer, you know?
33:34 - I'm fucking, all the way to the extreme,
33:36 - and then you're like "Bro!
33:39 - Bro, that's the wrong way dude!
33:43 - You went too far!"
33:44 - - "Ground yourself!"
33:45 - - "Come back!"
33:45 - - "I touched the butt!"
33:46 - (laughs)
33:47 - - Yeah.
33:48 - "You went too perfectionist."
33:50 - But, the cool thing that happened was
33:54 - you know that other girl
that I was talking about?
33:56 - He was talking with?
33:57 - He did get to make out with her.
33:58 - - Don't fucking bring that up.
33:59 - - I know, I'm sorry dude.
34:01 - - It doesn't matter dude.
34:02 - You're 24?
34:03 - - Yeah.
34:04 - - Dude you'll be 26.
34:05 - - Do you know how deep in your content
34:06 - she would have to be to watch it?
34:07 - We're like 30 minutes in.
34:08 - - Yeah.
34:09 - - If she watches this
it's totally worth it.
34:11 - - Just don't drop the name.
34:12 - - I'm not dropping the name.
34:16 - It rhymes with HariKari.
34:18 - (laughs)
34:19 - - I would...
- I'm fucking kidding.
34:21 - - I would drop the name,
but I don't know it, so.
34:23 - - Yeah you don't know the name.
34:23 - - Come on, tell me.
34:25 - (laughs)
34:26 - - I'll tell you right now.
34:26 - - Oh shit, it's not-
34:29 - (whispers)
34:33 - - Yeah, so that was great.
34:36 - So you made out as a developer.
34:38 - - It happened.
34:39 - I got lucky for once, right.
34:40 - - No!
34:41 - No, fuck that!
34:42 - We had like a six hour long conversation.
34:45 - - We did, and that helped.
34:47 - - And yeah.
34:48 - You went in there with a plan.
34:50 - - I went in there with the-
34:52 - - Your plan of attack.
34:52 - - With the right belief system, yeah.
34:53 - With a different belief,
that's all I needed.
34:55 - - What was the belief?
34:57 - - That it was okay.
34:59 - - What was okay?
35:00 - - And that, it was okay to try,
35:01 - and if it didn't work
out it would be fine.
35:02 - And it's fine.
35:04 - - Wow.
35:05 - - We're still good friends.
35:08 - - And we know that she's
gonna be leaving, right?
35:11 - So once she leaves, would
you be happier now with this,
35:15 - what took place, or would
you be happier if you never
35:18 - actually stepped up and took action?
35:21 - - I'd be happier that I took
this step, improved myself.
35:23 - She knows that too, I told that to her.
35:24 - - Yeah.
35:25 - - And she agrees.
35:27 - - It just makes everyone respect you more.
35:31 - - It just had to be done.
35:32 - You gotta rise to the occasion sometimes.
35:34 - - That's right.
35:35 - - It never ends.
35:36 - It never ends.
35:37 - - It never ends, you know?
35:39 - - It's a beautiful thing.
35:41 - - So, what's the solution
for a developer who's like,
35:44 - "All right man, look, you
guys have stuck the knife
35:48 - deep enough into my wounds,
35:50 - this is not feeling great,
I'm not feeling great,
35:52 - (laughs)
35:54 - watching this content,
I'm about to shut it off."
35:55 - - Oh shit.
35:57 - - "You guys have gone too
far. It's gotten too real."
36:02 - And the developer's just
like, "Fuck, this is it."
36:05 - But he has all the emotional
leverage in the fucking world,
36:07 - he's ready to fucking take action now.
36:09 - So what's the next step for him?
36:11 - Like should he just start going
crazy, start going to clubs?
36:14 - Like, what the fuck?
36:15 - - Probably, right?
36:16 - - I'm actually a believer that
you need some kind of vent
36:21 - to give you enough emotional leverage,
36:25 - positive or negative, that
you don't have control over.
36:27 - - Yeah.
36:28 - - Like almost depth, right?
36:31 - - Yeah like a lot of
people, it's break ups.
36:32 - That was for me, a lot of my
friends who got in break ups
36:34 - they turn around and now
they're making fucking
36:36 - six figures drop shipping in Chicago.
36:38 - I have a couple of friends who did that.
36:39 - People whose family members died,
36:42 - like if the father passed away
36:44 - or the brother passed away or something.
36:45 - Anything that will spike
your emotions enough
36:48 - it'll snap you out of your
shit and interrupt the pattern,
36:50 - and then you can actually
commit to something different
36:52 - for long enough for it to become,
at least a bit of a habit,
36:55 - and then you can-
36:56 - - Git commit.
36:57 - - Exactly.
36:58 - That's so fucking nerdy.
37:01 - But yeah.
37:02 - - This is a nerd show, bro.
37:03 - - I'm just trying to keep
throwing in something relevant,
37:05 - you know, because they
won't get the girl thing
37:07 - you were talking about,
or we're talking about.
37:08 - - Well they might.
37:09 - We don't know who's watching this.
37:10 - - "Git commit."
37:11 - That's true.
37:12 - - Girls could be watching this.
37:13 - - Hi!
- Girls help us.
37:13 - - Dude I have a lot of RSD fans bro.
37:15 - - If girls are watching this,
37:17 - drop in the comments how
guys can actually win.
37:20 - - Yeah.
37:21 - - How can they win this game.
37:23 - - Yeah.
37:24 - Like when we walk up to you,
you want us to be a man,
37:27 - not a little boy whose
scared of shit, right?
37:28 - So help us.
37:30 - - Some wise old men once
said that you should
37:32 - not take girls advice from girls.
37:36 - - Yeah that's true.
37:37 - No.
37:38 - - Yeah, yeah, yeah you really shouldn't
37:40 - - I don't know.
37:40 - I don't know if it was right,
37:41 - but I'm just putting it out there.
37:42 - - The quote goes as such:
37:47 - If I want to catch fish,
37:49 - do I ask the fish or the fisherman?
37:51 - - Wow!
37:53 - - That's right.
37:53 - - That's the quote.
37:54 - - Whoa, bring it in baby girl!
37:55 - - That's not even about
guys picking up girls,
37:57 - that's also about girls picking up guys.
37:59 - Why would you ask guys when
you could ask a girl that's-
38:01 - - Whoa, this guy is throwing bombs now.
38:03 - - I don't even know what that is.
38:05 - Is that some Chicago stuff?
38:05 - - That's Asian wisdom bro.
38:07 - That's Asian wisdom striking hard.
38:09 - - With the jazz hand finger swipes.
38:11 - - I do all of it.
38:12 - Like you know, you play guitar, you know?
38:14 - - Ukulele.
38:16 - - Ukulele.
38:17 - - Ukulele.
38:19 - - Finger picking.
38:20 - - So you don't ask girls, so.
38:23 - Okay what do you do?
38:25 - - You can ask a girl for
her singular point of view,
38:28 - but for overall success with girls,
38:30 - you don't wanna ask any singular girl.
38:31 - - Correct.
I agree.
38:32 - - That's what I'm trying to say.
38:33 - For any single girl,
38:34 - you need to respect what
she independently desires,
38:37 - because she does know what she wants
38:39 - and what she doesn't
want more than in general
38:42 - what girls would like
biologically, and guys too.
38:45 - - Right.
38:45 - - Is that where you got it from?
38:46 - - What?
- Biologic?
38:47 - - No, I got that.
38:48 - He picked that up from me.
38:49 - - He picked it up from me.
38:51 - - Okay.
38:51 - - Nothing can change like 240
years of evolution, right?
38:53 - There's some shit we can't change.
38:54 - - Right.
38:55 - - But.
38:58 - - If a bear jumped on you,
you would be frightened.
39:01 - - Uh-huh.
39:05 - Unless you're-
39:06 - - If a earthquake started automatically,
39:06 - you would be shook.
39:08 - (laughs)
39:09 - - Right?
39:11 - - Come on.
39:11 - - And if you approached a
girl without giving a fuck,
39:15 - she would be infatuated.
39:20 - - Wow dude.
39:21 - Those are probably that,
39:22 - the best sentences that
came out of your mouth, bro.
39:27 - Wow!
39:28 - - Can we write that down?
39:29 - - And it rhymed!
39:29 - - There's a whiteboard right there.
39:31 - (laughs)
39:32 - - This is like the
second coming of Christ!
39:33 - (laughs)
39:34 - He has the beard and everything.
39:35 - - Brown Christ!
39:38 - - I mean, some of these things
can be really that simple,
39:42 - and I feel like people, we just go on
39:44 - and we over complicate it.
39:47 - So, where does a developer start?
39:48 - Does he start in the Instagram Dms.
39:51 - (mumbles)
39:52 - (laughs)
39:54 - - Is that where a developer starts?
39:55 - - I think you start
39:56 - with the Python script
like Tinder swiping.
39:59 - (laughs)
40:00 - - Swipe, swipe!
40:01 - - Automated Tinder swiping!
40:01 - - Face detection!
40:02 - - If eyes Asian enough, then swipe right.
40:05 - - If eyes Asian enough,
age over 18, under 35!
40:09 - - Yeah.
40:10 - Mouse click, drag left.
40:12 - Mouse click, drag right.
- Over 18!
40:13 - (laughs)
40:16 - - Under or equal 35.
40:19 - - If width to height ratio of eyes.
40:23 - - Threshold!
40:27 - - Can you make a dictionary?
40:28 - - Oh my goodness.
40:29 - (laughs)
40:30 - - Can you make a dictionary of,
40:31 - you know, their waist to height ratio?
40:33 - - Loop through it?
40:34 - - Like, busty.
40:35 - - Yeah, exactly!
40:36 - - Loop through it.
40:37 - - Oh boy.
40:38 - - She should look like a squiggly bracket.
40:41 - - Oh god.
40:42 - - And did you notice I said dictionary,
40:44 - because Python you know.
40:45 - - Come on!
40:47 - - Come on, man.
40:49 - - You know my audience man.
40:50 - - Awareness game, come on baby.
40:50 - - You know my audience.
40:51 - - Shit.
40:52 - - The only thing braces are
useful for are dictionaries.
40:56 - - That's correct.
40:58 - - Yeah.
40:59 - - Yeah so okay, I start off,
40:59 - so let's say I start off,
maybe a script, that's funny.
41:02 - But I am a developer, and
this is a real problem.
41:07 - What do I do?
41:08 - Like really, do I start off with Dms?
41:10 - Maybe that's the easiest way, right?
41:13 - Start off like messaging?
41:15 - Like maybe a colleague that I was
41:17 - too scared to do anything with,
41:18 - and I'm thinking I might
actually start off by,
41:21 - because right now a lot of
people don't have that courage,
41:24 - so like what if they just started off by
41:26 - reaching out to one of their colleagues,
41:27 - or a friend in school
41:28 - that they'd see in college or whatever.
41:29 - Because a lot of them are 18 to 24,
41:32 - and they could just start off by going
41:33 - "Hey, do you wanna grab
a coffee this week?
41:38 - Wednesday at 7:00pm at Starbucks."
41:42 - Could that be a possible start?
41:44 - - Yeah, even just asking the question
41:45 - is a step in the right direction.
41:46 - - That's a brilliant text, by the way.
41:49 - It's brilliant, you should use it.
41:51 - And then you can thank me once it works.
41:54 - But if you just sent it right now,
41:56 - like, let's say, a
thousand people watch this.
41:59 - How many will take actual action?
42:01 - Probably five, right?
42:03 - - That's being very-
42:04 - - Very generous!
42:05 - - Very generous.
42:06 - - But five.
42:07 - Out of one of them, I promise
you out of those five,
42:10 - one will get a response before
this video actually ends.
42:13 - So if you pause right now.
42:15 - - 20 percent conversion rate, baby.
42:17 - - That's a 20 percent conversion rate.
42:18 - That's how good this text is.
42:20 - I promise if-
- What was that text again?
42:22 - - A lot of you, the text-
42:23 - - Well, rewind it.
42:24 - - But the text is literally this,
42:28 - it's very simple, okay?
42:30 - Reach out to like, your
colleagues or your friends,
42:34 - any girl that you you like.
42:36 - - Enjoy the company of.
42:38 - - You enjoy the company of.
42:39 - - Not even has to be
romantically, it's just like.
42:41 - - Right, you enjoy the company,
42:42 - and you want to meet.
42:43 - And this could actually
work with clients as well,
42:44 - like this is phenomenal.
42:45 - It works with girls and
clients, or potential clients.
42:48 - But reach out and just say,
42:49 - "Hey, do you want to hang out, this week,
42:54 - Wednesday at 7:00pm and grab some coffee?"
42:57 - Sit down at Starbucks for
like 10 minutes, five minutes.
43:00 - Something that is very limited in scope,
43:03 - and you're meeting in a public place,
43:05 - and it's calm, and it's
cool, and it's chill,
43:07 - and that can just be your,
43:11 - you know, in on getting
more comfortable with this.
43:14 - - It's so funny, I can already
imagine so many people just.
43:17 - - Contemplating
43:18 - - Being, no.
43:19 - Not even that, not even there yet.
43:21 - Being so uncomfortable,
- Right.
43:22 - - Even hearing this.
43:24 - - I know.
43:25 - - Even hearing it, because they're like,
43:27 - "A text like that?"
43:29 - - Yeah.
43:32 - - "It doesn't sound like a pickup line."
43:34 - - Right.
43:35 - - "It's a shit pickup line!"
43:36 - - Yeah.
43:37 - - "What pick-up line should I have?"
43:37 - - Or it might even make them cringe.
43:39 - - Tennessee, what's that?
43:41 - - The ultimate pickup line.
43:41 - - You know the Tennessee, the ten I see?
43:43 - What is that pickup line, bro?
43:46 - - Are you from Tennessee?
43:47 - - Yeah!
43:48 - - Because you're the only ten I see.
43:49 - - I'm gonna use that.
43:51 - - My name is Raj, but
you can call me tonight.
43:54 - (laughs)
43:56 - - That works for a lot
of my fans in India.
43:59 - Let's go baby, India gang.
44:01 - Here to pick up some beautiful women.
44:07 - So I think really maybe start
off with something simple
44:10 - like that, you know, like
texts, and that's pretty simple.
44:13 - But I know, like, a lot of
people watching this would just
44:15 - be cringing right now
because they're like,
44:17 - "Man, this just sounds..."
44:19 - Honestly, I don't even
think a lot of people
44:21 - think that this would ever work.
44:24 - - That's what I'm saying.
44:26 - They're uncomfortable hearing it.
44:28 - Like doing it and actually
thinking it's gonna work?
44:32 - No, nowhere close.
44:34 - But here's what I think
they should do, okay?
44:37 - It's very simple.
44:39 - - Yeah, let's start with simple.
44:40 - - It's not about just-
44:42 - and there's a thing
about learning the skill
44:45 - to be better with girls,
44:48 - but, it's just being a better human, dude.
44:51 - - Right. Yeah.
44:52 - - You work on your finances, you work
44:55 - on your inner self confidence,
like doing good shit.
45:01 - You're gonna be good with girls,
45:03 - because here's the thing, right.
45:04 - You might even be bad with girls,
45:07 - but because you're a person who's like,
45:12 - you know, who's always
striving to do good-
45:15 - - Right.
45:16 - - Ultimately you're gonna find a way-
45:19 - You know when we were back
45:21 - in high school or whatever,
we sucked with girls.
45:24 - We were terrible with girls.
45:26 - We're not like, we didn't
go "Oh, you know what,
45:29 - I'm so bad with girls, girls
never pay attention to me."
45:33 - And then stayed there.
45:35 - No, we just kept going at it,
45:37 - and we found out simple pick up.
45:40 - And we're like, "What? It's that easy?
45:42 - You literally go in front of the girl
45:45 - and take off your pants?
45:46 - (laughs)
45:47 - And that's how you open?
45:49 - Wow."
45:50 - - That's a great opener, by the way.
45:52 - - Because who does that?
45:53 - - "I can do that!"
45:54 - "I can do that!"
45:55 - - That's actually,
45:56 - seriously, like real talk?
45:56 - That's actually really good.
45:58 - - And, after that, we're like.
46:02 - - Fuck yeah, bro.
46:03 - Get rowdy in this bitch.
46:06 - - And, after that we're like,
nah, this is not enough.
46:10 - This is still not enough.
46:13 - - RSD...
46:14 - - That's right.
46:15 - - That's where the real stuff's at.
46:17 - - And we kept getting better at it,
46:19 - because we were willing
to, you know, take action,
46:22 - and that's only because
we're always striving
46:26 - to be better, right?
46:27 - Always striving to be be better.
46:29 - It doesn't matter what it is, like
46:30 - girls, career,
- Chess, coding.
46:31 - - Chess, coding, guitar, music, ping pong,
46:35 - whatever it is.
46:36 - - Business!
46:37 - - Exactly.
46:38 - - Podcasts!
46:40 - Videos!
46:41 - - We've always figured it out.
46:44 - - Be cool!
46:47 - - How to be cool.com, next
course, bro, next course.
46:50 - - Does that website exist?
46:52 - - I'm gonna launch it.
46:57 - - Launch a course on it.
46:58 - - That's right.
47:00 - - It's this podcast.
47:01 - - The same skills that are stopping you
47:04 - from being able to date
the girl of your dreams,
47:08 - are probably the same skills that are
47:09 - stopping you from getting a client.
47:11 - Are probably the same skills that are
47:12 - stopping you from getting a business.
47:14 - Are probably the same skills that
47:16 - are stopping you from
reaching out to whatsdev
47:18 - and never getting a reply.
47:23 - Or somebody else, right?
47:26 - Like, those skills take time, you know?
47:30 - I don't know what will have
a better ROI on your life.
47:33 - If you're having problems with girls,
47:36 - I don't know what will have a better ROI.
47:38 - Actually trying to meet more girls,
47:41 - or maybe read Rich Dad, Poor Dad.
47:45 - - The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck.
47:46 - - You know.
47:47 - - Mark Manson.
47:50 - - A must read!
47:51 - - Yeah.
47:53 - - You wanna be better with relationships?
47:54 - You have to read that.
47:55 - Not a dating book, read that.
47:58 - And then you can go to dating.
47:59 - - And then yeah, you can dive down deeper.
48:01 - That's a good starting point.
48:03 - That's actually one of the
first books I started with.
48:05 - - That's what I'd recommend to everybody.
48:06 - They're like, "Tenzin
what book should I read?"
48:08 - I'm like, the Subtle Art
of Not Giving a Fuck.
48:09 - - Yeah, it puts you on the right path.
48:10 - It opens some doors.
48:12 - - And it's not just one of
those books that are, like,
48:16 - did you want to say something?
48:17 - - Yeah.
48:18 - - He's on the-
48:18 - - Hold that thought, I already
know what you wanna say.
48:23 - - I love that book because
it's not just one of those,
48:26 - you know, books written in 1973.
48:31 - That's still really good advice there,
48:33 - but it's not relatable.
48:34 - - I saw that guy convert kids.
48:36 - I saw him talk.
48:37 - - Yeah you said that.
48:39 - But, this book is like hip as well.
48:44 - The narrator?
48:45 - - Yeah he's cool.
- Mark Manson?
48:46 - - No, no, no.
48:47 - - The audio book?
48:48 - - Yes the audio book.
48:50 - - Is it not narrated by the author?
48:51 - - [Tenzin] No, it's not.
48:53 - You have to listen to it,
48:54 - you have to.
48:55 - - Yeah I listened to it.
48:56 - I just don't remember who narrated it.
48:57 - - I don't remember his
name, but he was so good.
49:01 - He was so good.
49:02 - - Right.
49:05 - - You have to read that book.
49:07 - - Pulling it up on my Audible right now.
49:08 - You might wanna punch in on this, Frankie,
49:09 - once I pull it up.
49:10 - And you guys have
probably heard of it, but.
49:11 - - Yeah.
49:15 - - It is narrated by Roger Wayne.
49:17 - - Yes, Roger Wayne.
49:19 - - It's this book.
49:20 - Can you zoom in on that, Frankie?
49:20 - - [Tenzin] I don't think
he can zoom in that far.
49:23 - - [Roger Wayne] By Mark Manson.
49:25 - Read by Roger Wayne.
49:26 - - By Roger Wayne.
49:27 - - No?
49:30 - - Okay.
49:31 - - [Roger Wayne] Chapter one: Don't Try.
49:35 - Charles Bukowski was an alcoholic,
49:38 - womanizer, and a chronic gambler.
49:39 - - When that's the first word of a book,
49:41 - you know you're gonna learn something.
49:42 - (laughs)
49:43 - - "Charles Bukowski."
49:45 - - Yeah.
49:46 - - Okay, he wanted to say
something, let's hear it.
49:49 - Tell them!
49:50 - Tell the people!
49:51 - - Okay, here's what it is, right?
49:53 - I think everybody has their
49:56 - flavors of the book that they like,
49:58 - I fucking hate this book, personally.
50:01 - But I think that.
50:02 - - No, no, no, verbalize it.
50:04 - Like why do you hate this book?
50:07 - - Okay, okay, so I don't like
this book because, for me,
50:13 - it's a little too mopey.
50:15 - It's written by a person
who's really depressed,
50:19 - and I just-
50:21 - - You'd be surprised, dude.
50:22 - - When I started listening to it,
50:24 - I started really going down, you know?
50:27 - Because I tell you always,
I've got enough dark in me,
50:30 - I need to read- the same reason
you like 48 Laws of Power,
50:34 - and there's nothing wrong with it,
50:35 - I fucking read two chapters and I'm like,
50:37 - "Man, I gotta stop reading this shit."
50:38 - And I went to 10x, like I
started reading 10x again.
50:42 - I get the same vibe from this book,
50:45 - and my heart just starts to
go in this weird dark place.
50:50 - And I get the whole Buddhist
philosophy behind things,
50:53 - and I really appreciate
it, but personally for me
50:56 - it doesn't get me going, you know?
50:57 - - Got you, got you.
50:58 - - And I really listened
to it, I gave it a shot,
51:00 - but for me, the ones that work magic
51:04 - almost every time is like, 10x.
51:06 - - Got you.
51:07 - - Works every time, really helps.
51:10 - And then-
51:10 - - It's a great book, as well.
51:11 - - Yeah.
51:12 - - Yeah 10x is a great book
to, like, hype you up.
51:13 - You need a dose of testosterone?
51:17 - There you go.
51:18 - - But that book, you know the
crazy thing is it hypes me up,
51:21 - but it's one of the books
that gets me to take the most
51:23 - massive amounts of action
I've taken in my whole life.
51:26 - - Right, it's like-
- Personally .
51:28 - - It's like a dose of,
you know, testosterone.
51:32 - - In word form.
51:33 - - It's like, "Let's go! Let's go!"
51:35 - - Yeah, like a lot of my courses
51:37 - that I actually made back in 2016,
51:41 - in October of 2016 I made
33 videos in October.
51:45 - Produced 33 videos.
51:46 - That was my highest producing month, okay?
51:49 - I wish I produced at that level forever,
51:51 - but that was when I was readng 10x.
51:54 - - Then you'd be called Gary Vee dude.
51:55 - - That's right.
51:56 - - There can only be one Gary Vee.
51:57 - - I'm getting close to it, you know?
51:59 - Some people in the influencer communities
52:00 - are making fun of me.
52:01 - They're like, "This guy is like Gary Vee."
52:04 - And then that guys comments
got 16 likes on Instagram.
52:09 - So he was dissing me but I was actually,
52:11 - that was the biggest compliment.
52:13 - 16 people agreed on.
52:14 - I'm like holy shit!
52:15 - Like Gary Vee talks to me one time,
52:18 - and now I'm being compared to him.
52:20 - Man, I'm flattered.
52:27 - You know?
52:28 - - Yeah, Belarus and
Pakistan are close enough.
52:31 - (laughs)
52:33 - They've both got the hair on the chin.
52:34 - - It's funny, I used to hate-
52:36 - - Where is Belarus dude?
52:37 - - It's right next to Russia.
52:38 - - It's right next to Germany and Ukraine.
52:39 - - Ukraine, okay, okay I know where it is.
52:41 - - Guys can we talk about Chernobyl?
52:43 - Let's switch it up.
52:45 - - Dude!
52:46 - Oh my god!
52:48 - - Well Frankie and I have
not seen the 5th episode.
52:50 - You finished it without us.
52:51 - - Don't run it for the
podcast people either.
52:55 - - I know, I know.
52:57 - - How was Chernobyl guys?
52:59 - Whoa, almost died there buddy.
53:02 - - You go first.
53:04 - (sighs)
53:08 - - Before you say anything,
53:10 - did you guys watch it
because of my recommendation?
53:13 - - You and my brother.
53:15 - - Who said it first?
53:16 - - You said it first, I think.
53:19 - - No, no no, I think my brother.
53:22 - - It says if it's such a crazy thing.
53:24 - - He seeded it, he seeded it.
53:26 - - My brother said it first,
then I came to Chicago-
53:29 - - They just flipped the script on me.
53:30 - - No, here's what happened.
53:32 - My brother said it
before I came to Chicago,
53:34 - then you told me and I really
53:35 - took your recommendation to heart.
53:37 - Like yours actually, because
I was there physically,
53:40 - and you kept fucking hammering,
53:41 - it actually had a lot of impact on me.
53:43 - Probably more than,
53:44 - because my brother spent
like one second telling me.
53:46 - Then I came back to L.A.
53:48 - (laughs)
53:50 - I came back to L.A.
53:51 - - From Argentina.
53:53 - - Argentina.
53:54 - And then I survived- no, from Chicago.
53:57 - And then I survived the 7.1
earthquake with this guy.
54:01 - - And Frankie.
54:02 - - And Frankie.
54:03 - - We were all here together.
54:04 - This light was shaking.
54:05 - - Right, let's put the clip from my phone.
54:07 - I have the clip from my phone.
54:08 - This earthquake is literally crazy.
54:11 - - [Aaron] Yeah bro, but
this shit can fucking-
54:20 - - [Qazi] Oh, the fuck is this?
54:22 - - That's what it sounded like.
54:23 - - All right, all right.
54:24 - And then, basically what happened was,
54:28 - after the earthquake I was like, dude.
54:31 - We were frightened, and we're like,
54:32 - "The best time to watch Chernobyl is now."
54:35 - So we started watching Chernobyl.
54:36 - - Frightened.
54:38 - Vulnerable.
54:39 - - It got 9.7 or something.
54:40 - - Insane.
54:40 - - I would say this ranks
above Game of Thrones for me.
54:48 - - I've never seen Game of
Thrones, so I can't say.
54:51 - - Damn, that's crazy boy.
54:54 - - Yeah.
54:55 - - Especially after season eight?
54:57 - 110 percent.
54:59 - - Bro.
55:00 - - All the audience members are like,
55:01 - "Yeah! Season 8 sucked!"
55:03 - - Oh did it suck?
55:03 - - I can just imagine them.
55:05 - I won't say anything, bro.
55:06 - It's just my personal opinion.
55:08 - You might like it, you never know.
55:13 - - You know, that guy's accent?
55:17 - - Which guy's accent?
55:18 - - In Chernobyl?
55:19 - The old guy with the big glasses?
55:20 - - Yeah.
55:21 - - I fucking love his accent, dude.
55:23 - Like his voice and the way he speaks.
55:25 - - Yes.
55:26 - - Like his inflection and everything.
55:27 - - Yeah, there's an intonation
and a rasp to his voice.
55:29 - There's like a...
55:31 - - Radioactive.
55:33 - - Yeah, yeah, yeah!
55:36 - I can't even pinpoint it but there's a-
55:38 - - Graphite!
55:39 - - Yeah!
55:40 - - Graphite!
55:41 - - There was graphite on the floor.
55:43 - - There was graphite on the floor.
55:45 - I don't know how to speak like him.
55:47 - He's really tough.
55:49 - Who are the other guys in that show?
55:50 - Oh, the old guy!
55:52 - He was badass too.
55:53 - - The old guy?
55:54 - - "Comrade!"
55:56 - - Here's who's the bad ass, okay.
55:59 - - The naked miner.
56:00 - - Yes!
56:01 - The naked miner.
56:02 - The fucking leader, oh my god.
56:05 - - Oh my gosh.
56:06 - - He's just walking up with his dick out.
56:07 - - He had so, like his
balls were so massive
56:10 - he had to walk like this.
56:13 - - He's like, " So what?"
56:14 - - His legs have to get out of the way.
56:15 - - And then when he walks away from them
56:17 - he's just butt naked, he's like.
56:19 - - Yeah he's just getting back to business.
56:21 - - He doesn't give a fuck.
56:22 - - Saving millions, whatever he has to do.
56:23 - - The naked miner, our
favorite part of this show.
56:26 - Dude, should we call this
podcast "The Naked Miner"?
56:28 - - Just do it, dude.
56:29 - Just do it.
56:30 - - Welcome to The Naked Miner.
- The episode!
56:33 - - Naked Miners and Virgin Developers.
56:39 - Something like that.
56:41 - - Yeah, sure.
56:42 - - Or maybe NLP, Naked Lovely Programmers.
56:47 - - That was random, but sure.
56:48 - - Neuro-linguistic programming.
56:49 - - Exactly, play off that, exactly.
56:52 - Neuro-linguistic programming.
56:55 - - Is it "nu-ro" or "neuro"?
56:57 - - Neuro, I think.
56:58 - N-E-U-R-O.
56:59 - - Okay.
57:00 - - You know, another
part I liked a lot was,
57:02 - he's like the guy comes in the suit,
57:05 - and he goes, "You gotta go."
57:07 - And he's like, "Where, why?"
57:12 - And then that guy's like,
"You have to go, it's orders."
57:16 - He's like, "No but he's going anywhere."
57:18 - And then the police
officer with a gun is like,
57:20 - "You can't talk to us like that!"
57:22 - He's like, "Shut the fuck up."
57:24 - He's like, "You're gonna
have to shoot us all.
57:28 - You're gonna run out of bullets.
57:29 - And then when we're left,
57:30 - we're gonna beat the piss out of you."
57:32 - And then the guy in the suit freaks out?
57:34 - Oh, that scene was good.
57:36 - And then every one of them that's
57:37 - leaving starts to go like
this with their dirty hands.
57:39 - - Yeah, yeah.
57:40 - - They're like, "Now you look
like the minister of coal."
57:44 - (laughs)
57:47 - - Okay, we're getting
into too many spoilers.
57:49 - We're gonna a timestamp,
57:51 - and then we're gonna
say get to this point.
57:52 - - That's not a spoiler,
that's just like a scene.
57:55 - - I don't know some people might be upset.
57:56 - I would've been upset by that.
57:57 - - That's not a...
57:58 - - Like cool little moments.
57:59 - - Put the courtesy.
58:02 - - That's not like Game of Thrones,
58:04 - like Khaleesi's the mother of-
58:05 - - Skip to the timestamp because we've
58:06 - literally been touching
on nothing but Chernobyl.
58:09 - - They shouldn't be
watching shows anyways,
58:10 - they need to freelance.
58:11 - - Yeah, unless they have an earthquake.
58:13 - Then they can watch it.
58:14 - - Yeah.
58:15 - - That's why we watched
it, that was great.
58:18 - - You know, bro, Stranger
Things new season is out.
58:21 - The Dark new season is out.
58:22 - - I've already seen it.
58:23 - - Both?
58:24 - - Yeah.
58:25 - - Which one was better?
Don't tell me a lot more.
58:26 - - I'm kidding, I didn't see Dark yet.
58:27 - But Stranger Things was good.
58:29 - - Bro, I looked up Dark
and my brother went crazy.
58:32 - My brother said Dark destroyed.
58:33 - - Season two is way better.
58:35 - - I heard it's way better.
58:36 - - You didn't watch season two, right?
58:37 - - I didn't, but I heard
it was really better.
58:38 - - My brother says it's way better.
58:40 - - See? I knew, I knew
what he was gonna say.
58:43 - I read your mind, dude.
58:44 - - Ever episode is like
9.3, 9.7, 9.5 on IMDB.
58:49 - I'm like, "Oh, I can't wait."
58:51 - - I wanted to watch it so bad.
58:53 - - Dark is like Stranger Things but darker.
58:54 - And my brother said season two of Dark
58:56 - feels like the extension of Chernobyl.
58:59 - It literally feels like it's
the sequel to Chernobyl,
59:02 - because it starts out in
Chernobyl, and this show,
59:05 - when Chernobyl happened,
this is what I'm saying.
59:08 - - Didn't you buy a book about Chernobyl
59:10 - after we watched the show?
59:11 - - Hold on, hold on. They said
the time got warped in the-
59:14 - - Don't say anything! Anything!
59:16 - - No, it's not spoilers!
59:17 - - He's already sold, he's already sold.
59:19 - - But I'm saying it's from Chernobyl,
59:20 - like whatever's happening, one
of the causes is Chernobyl.
59:24 - This is from season one of Dark,
59:25 - bro, this is not even anything new.
59:26 - - Okay, I got you.
59:28 - - Isn't that crazy.
59:29 - I know you want me to stop
talking about it, I'll stop.
59:31 - - That's where Chernobyl
was, like that nuclear...
59:33 - - Yeah, they're showing it literally,
59:35 - my brother said it
literally starts from 1986,
59:38 - like right when Chernobyl
happened it starts from there.
59:40 - So my brother's like
it literally felt like.
59:42 - - It's true, 1986, 33 years, 2019.
59:46 - 1953...
59:48 - - And then if you watch Chernobyl-
59:50 - - Whoa, 33 years!
59:53 - - You know all the details.
59:53 - - And they say that, in Dark,
they say that its a wormhole
59:57 - creates a multi-dimension,
59:59 - and so not only does the
past impact the future,
60:02 - but the future impacts
the past and the present.
60:06 - I was like, "Yo!"
60:08 - - Wait, you didn't see season one?
60:10 - - I have.
60:11 - - Okay, okay. But isn't that crazy?
60:12 - - Yeah.
60:13 - - That's crazy, bro.
60:14 - I gotta watch season two.
60:16 - - It's based in 20-
60:17 - - I wanted to watch
season two so badly, okay?
60:19 - I started, there were so
many things that I forgot,
60:23 - I was like, "I can't do this
without watching a recap,
60:27 - or at least skimming through season one."
60:31 - So many things.
60:32 - Like season one, even after
watching it completely,
60:35 - I had so many questions.
60:37 - - Really?
60:38 - - I had so many questions.
60:39 - You didn't have any questions?
60:40 - - About season one?
60:41 - - Yeah.
60:42 - - Oh yeah, millions.
60:43 - - That's what I'm saying.
60:44 - (laughs)
60:44 - - I've never heard of this show.
60:46 - - What?
60:46 - - The Dark.
60:47 - - It's hard to hear about it.
60:49 - - Is it Netflix?
60:49 - - I told you about it a long
time ago, when I discovered it.
60:51 - I told my brother about it too.
60:52 - - No you didn't.
60:53 - I remember exactly.
60:54 - You told me, but I had
watched it three weeks before.
60:58 - - Oh shit, okay. I told
my brother about that shit
61:00 - because that shit was crazy.
61:02 - And this thing, here's
the right way to watch it,
61:05 - for everyone who wants to watch it,
61:06 - there's only one right way to watch it.
61:08 - If you fuck this up the whole
show is gonna be ruined.
61:10 - It's gonna go from a 9.5 to like a 2.2.
61:12 - Watch it in German dubs
audio should be German.
61:17 - Because that's the show, it's German.
61:18 - Subtitles English.
61:20 - This is the only way to watch it.
61:22 - If you watch it in English,
61:23 - it literally like it'll drop for you.
61:25 - - Whoever watches it in the dub
61:27 - other than the language
native of that show-
61:30 - - It's so weak.
61:31 - - It just takes away from that-
61:32 - - The power.
61:33 - - That power.
61:34 - The rawness.
- Yeah.
61:35 - - It just takes away from so many things.
61:39 - I can't.
61:40 - Same thing with anime., I
don't get how people watch
61:43 - Japanese anime in English.
61:46 - "Oh my god!"
61:47 - - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
61:48 - - What!
61:49 - - Yeah, they're like "How are you doing?"
61:51 - - Yeah!
61:54 - - You know, it's almost like
that scene, where he's like
61:57 - [Foreign Language]
61:59 - You're gonna translate that
to "How many men were there?"
62:01 - Like that doesn't have the same thing.
62:03 - - "How many men were there?"
62:04 - - I mean that's still pretty cool,
62:06 - but like usually it doesn't translate.
62:08 - - It's not that cool.
62:09 - - Yeah, like that has power to it.
62:10 - That was an Urdu/Hindi thing.
62:12 - - Yeah.
62:14 - - You're not that Asian, dude.
62:15 - I'm Asian on so many
levels, you have no idea.
62:19 - - Can you speak Chinese?
62:20 - I'm Asian with five languages.
62:21 - - I get that English is not Asian,
62:23 - so that makes it four languages.
62:26 - - You can speak four languages?
62:27 - - Five languages.
62:29 - - Wow.
62:29 - Hindi and Urdu are the same thing so I...
62:31 - - I'll take the credit!
62:32 - - Come on, man!
62:33 - - I'll take the one-up, you know?
62:34 - - Cause the guy speaks Hindi and Urdu.
62:36 - - Really?
62:37 - - Yeah, I can read too.
62:38 - This guy can't.
62:39 - - You can't read Urdu, right?
62:40 - - Read what?
62:41 - - Did you learn it from him?
62:42 - - I can read Urdu and
I can read Arabic, son.
62:43 - And I can recite Arabic.
62:44 - - But you can't read Hindi.
62:46 - Okay, you're not Hindu, so I got you.
62:48 - You're not Indian, I got you I got you.
62:49 - That makes sense.
62:51 - I can't blame you for that.
62:53 - - I can write in improper
grammar, what can you do?
62:55 - (laughs)
62:56 - - Yeah most Indian people can't like
62:59 - read Hindi at all or Urdu.
63:03 - Like Paki people?
63:04 - They can't read Urdu like they can
63:05 - just understand it a little bit.
63:08 - - I mean I can read it.
63:09 - - And then I tell, I'm reading
the lyrics, because we went,
63:12 - a few weeks ago we went somewhere,
63:13 - and then on our way back from
the Lyft, it was a long drive,
63:18 - and they just put on some Bollywood shit,
63:20 - and I'm like,
63:21 - I would just read the lyrics
off of some lyric website.
63:24 - - But in English.
63:25 - - No, in Urdu.
63:27 - Like, Urdu or Hindi.
63:28 - And I was reading Hindi, of course.
63:30 - - You can read Hindi?
63:32 - - I can write, too.
63:33 - - You can read Sanskrit, because
you trained in that shit.
63:36 - - Yeah, I can write too.
63:38 - What do you want me to write?
63:40 - - "What's going on, bro?"
63:41 - - Write "Breh.
63:42 - What's going on, breh."
63:44 - - I'm kidding, I'm kidding about that.
63:46 - Just say, "What's going on Aaron?"
63:48 - - Yeah.
63:49 - - Or, "What's going on, homie?"
63:50 - - Write my name in Hindi.
63:51 - - Just say, "What's going on, man?"
63:52 - Like something like that.
63:53 - - Yeah.
63:54 - - It's like- literally it's like
63:56 - [Foreign Language]
63:58 - - Okay, just say, "look
under the staircase."
64:01 - - That sounds pretty...
64:03 - - That's...
64:04 - - Is that a Harry Potter Reference?
64:06 - - We have all the weirdest shit.
64:08 - - What does that even mean?
64:11 - - It doesn't mean anything,
bro, it's just provocative.
64:13 - Gets the people going.
64:15 - - Oh my god, that's from a song, right?
64:17 - - "Ball so hard,
motherfuckers want to fine me.
64:20 - First they gotta find me.
64:21 - What's 50 grand to a motherfucker like me?
64:23 - Can you please remind me?
64:24 - Ball so hard, that shit cray."
64:26 - - That shit cray.
64:27 - - Coding all day man,
know what I'm saying?
64:30 - That shit went viral.
64:32 - (laughs)
64:34 - - Beat drops.
64:35 - - That should be the intro song.
64:36 - - Dude, that went viral.
64:37 - I don't know if you know that,
but like, look at this shit.
64:41 - Multiple developers did this.
64:43 - They literally sent me this video back.
64:46 - - Oh shit.
64:47 - (rap music)
64:49 - That's insane.
64:50 - - Isn't that nuts?
64:51 - - That is insane.
64:53 - - Literally coding all day.
64:54 - - "Way too damn long!"
64:58 - - And this is another developer.
64:59 - - Holy shit.
65:03 - - "Coding all day man."
65:05 - This guy's going crazy coding.
65:07 - - With one hand.
65:08 - (laughs)
65:09 - - Yeah.
65:10 - - What is he doing with his left hand?
65:11 - - Command space.
65:13 - - What is he doing?
65:16 - - "Coding all day."
65:17 - - Get ad, get commit.
65:18 - - Toggle a side bar.
65:21 - - Literally the only thing
you need to know about Git
65:23 - is git-add, git-commit-m
followed by a message,
65:28 - and git push origin master.
65:31 - And git pull origin master.
65:32 - Like, you know those four commands.
65:35 - - Like, initially git clone, maybe.
65:36 - - And usually I do git init
you know, to start off with.
65:39 - - Yeah.
65:40 - - Like you have those, you don't
need anymore Git than that.
65:42 - Like very few is like, git
reset hard head, or head hard.
65:47 - That one is one of the most important ones
65:48 - that most people don't know,
65:50 - but that one is usually needed
to like go a commit back.
65:54 - And other stuff than
that is fancy, but like.
65:56 - - Yeah like git status
is just a- like git diff.
65:59 - Just like little flashes.
66:00 - - Git status is really important,
66:01 - yeah git status is pretty cool.
66:05 - - Git diff, git stash.
66:05 - - We just keep adding one thing.
66:06 - - We'll just keep adding.
66:08 - - It's always like that with Git.
66:09 - It's like, "Oh, you only need
three, you only need three."
66:11 - And then you're like, "Oh,
that is pretty useful."
66:12 - About five, six are pretty useful,
66:14 - those will get you about 98
percent of the way there,
66:17 - and then other two percent
is like extra stuff.
66:19 - - Or the git gat.
66:21 - - But Git is not GitHub.
66:23 - Can we clarify that and
make people understand that?
66:26 - Git is not GitHub.
66:27 - - You go ahead, bro. Knock
it out yourself dude.
66:31 - - Yeah.
66:33 - - I have explained this so many times,
66:35 - I don't wanna explain it.
66:36 - - Yeah, it's too much.
66:38 - But Git is not GitHub.
66:40 - Let's just leave it at that.
66:41 - - Git is not GitHub.
- Git is not GitHub.
66:43 - - It's like saying,
what is it like saying?
66:49 - - That's a pretty hard comparison.
66:51 - - Django is not Python, but, no.
66:53 - Python is not Django,
but Django is Python.
66:55 - - How about this?
66:56 - - Like a subset.
66:58 - One uses the other.
66:59 - - Git is like a time machine,
and GitHub is just like-
67:03 - - A time machine in a cloud.
67:05 - (laughs)
67:07 - - GitHub is like Dropbox for code.
67:11 - In like, simple terms.
67:12 - - Exactly.
67:13 - - GitHub is just where you put the code,
67:14 - it's just where you store the code.
67:16 - It's like Google Drive for code.
67:18 - - Yeah.
67:18 - - Right?
67:19 - Git is like a time machine.
67:22 - It allows you to go back and forward.
67:23 - If you fuck up, it's like a memory card
67:25 - when you used to play video
games when you were a kid.
67:27 - You got a memory card, you know?
67:29 - You fucked up, you die, you
restart it from somewhere.
67:33 - That's Git.
67:34 - That's all it is.
67:35 - - I always thought
GitHub was a web browser
67:38 - GUI version of Git.
67:39 - So like it's just.
67:40 - - That's not what it is, that's the thing.
67:41 - - That's not what it is?
67:42 - - That's not what it is, that's the thing.
67:43 - - That's what I've always understood it.
67:44 - - No, but like you know
how in Google Drive
67:46 - you can go in there and it
also has the ability to,
67:49 - if you're in an Excel
sheet in Google Drive,
67:51 - in Google Sheets, you know
how you can go back in time?
67:56 - Right?
67:57 - Just because it allows that functionality
67:59 - doesn't mean Google Drive is Git.
68:01 - See what I'm saying?
68:03 - It just allows the functional
to go back in time and shit.
68:07 - - I think he's more confused now.
68:09 - - I know, I know.
68:10 - I can see his face.
68:12 - - You upload your code, you can click-
68:13 - - Git is not GitHub bottom line.
68:17 - - GitHub is like Google
Drive for code, that's it.
68:22 - Git is a time machine.
68:23 - (laughs)
68:25 - - You know it took me a long time
68:27 - to come up with that analogy.
68:28 - It was a lot of hard work.
68:29 - That's why I keep saying
it over and over again.
68:31 - - It's a time machine. I mean,
yeah, that makes sense, too.
68:33 - - Really is a time machine, right?
68:36 - So, that's about it, that's about it.
68:39 - - That's a doozy on that one.
68:41 - - All right, any last words?
68:43 - - How long are we at?
68:45 - We're sitting at an
hour? Just over an hour?
68:47 - - Go out more!
68:48 - - Go out more.
68:49 - - Be a better human being, okay?
68:51 - - That's right.
68:52 - - And that's it.
68:53 - - That's pretty good.
68:54 - - That's really it.
68:55 - - That's pretty good.
68:56 - - Like if you just go out
more, not do crazy stuff.
68:58 - You don't even have to
go RSD simple pick up,
69:01 - anything like that.
69:02 - You don't even have to read a
dating book or whatever, okay?
69:05 - Just, like...
69:09 - pursue your goals, don't give up...
69:12 - and read books.
69:15 - That's it.
69:16 - - That's great.
69:17 - - That's it.
69:18 - - That is great.
69:19 - - Yeah. That's really it.
69:20 - - Wow. Any last words from you?
69:21 - - Like work on your foundations, you know.
69:23 - Everything will come to you.
69:24 - - Okay, last words from Aaron.
69:26 - - Well, yeah, similar idea, but like.
69:28 - If you're not, the one that
really stuck with me was like,
69:31 - if you're not embarrassed by
who you were six months ago,
69:34 - you're not changing enough.
69:35 - - Yesterday, bro. Six
months is way too long.
69:37 - - I mean, six months is
like a good chunk for like-
69:38 - - I know, I know I'm
just fucking with you.
69:40 - - A significant chunk.
69:41 - - All right, all right,
let him finish his comment.
69:42 - - I know, I know, I know.
69:43 - - All right, go ahead. Six months?
69:45 - - That's literally it.
69:46 - Yeah, like, what you're
doing now is the result
69:48 - of what you were doing six months ago.
69:49 - - That's pretty powerful.
69:50 - - Yeah.
69:51 - - I like that.
69:52 - - Yeah.
69:53 - - It's enough time to be
embarrassed by a previous self.
69:56 - - And yeah, you're not
ashamed to admit it.
69:58 - In the moment, of course,
you're not gonna be like,
69:59 - "Oh, I'm a fucking loser right now."
70:00 - I'm not gonna dive into everything.
70:02 - But you'd be like, "Oh
yeah, six months ago
70:03 - I had these problems, but they're fixed."
70:05 - - Right.
70:06 - - So.
70:07 - - Yeah man, that's insane.
70:09 - - It's a lifestyle, it's
not a fucking diet, so.
70:12 - - Really is.
70:13 - - You just have to commit to it.
70:14 - - Yup.
70:15 - And on my end, I will literally say that
70:18 - if you either wanna get more
clients or better dating life,
70:24 - honestly just go out more.
70:26 - Even if you you're not going out there
70:29 - with the intention of going
to, like, pick up girls
70:33 - or whatever, literally
just on the weekends go out
70:36 - with your friends and
just have a good time.
70:39 - Like learn how to enjoy socializing.
70:41 - Go to meet ups and enjoy talking.
70:43 - - Meetups.com?
70:44 - - Meetupscom.
70:45 - Don't just go there to network.
70:47 - Don't stay in your basement or
in this little room forever,
70:52 - for as many hours as possible,
70:54 - and then the only time you need a job,
70:56 - you out to networking,
70:57 - and then you hate it,
70:59 - and everybody can see from
your face that you hate it.
71:00 - And then you go around
handing out business cards,
71:02 - desperate to land a job,
because now you're in debt,
71:07 - you got out of college,
you don't have any money,
71:08 - and you need to get this job.
71:10 - Everybody can read that from your face,
71:13 - but instead, if you love the
process, you develop this habit
71:15 - of going out consistently,
71:17 - you enjoy socializing with people,
71:19 - not only will all your girl
problems will get solved,
71:23 - but you will build enough relationships
71:26 - to actually be landing
jobs as a developer.
71:29 - That's how he got a job as a developer,
71:31 - that's how I got all my clients,
71:33 - it was through relationships.
71:35 - That's how Aaron was able to connect,
71:37 - and work with Clever Programmer,
and do everything he does.
71:40 - It was through relationships.
71:42 - They're super, super powerful.
71:43 - - Yes, two Facebook people
we me today at VidCon.
71:46 - - Two Facebook engineers, yeah.
71:48 - - One working there for eight
years, one for five years.
71:50 - - Wow.
71:51 - - The one for eight years,
he went to Berkeley,
71:52 - and he couldn't find a job
after applying to a hundred,
71:55 - but one simple connection
got him into Facebook.
71:57 - - Listen.
71:58 - - This is so painful, listen.
72:00 - - A Berkeley grad.
72:01 - - Please emphasize it.
72:02 - - He applied to hundreds of jobs.
72:06 - - Got one response.
72:07 - - And kept going!
72:08 - And kept going.
72:09 - - Yup.
- Yup.
72:10 - - Most people apply to
two jobs and they're like,
72:12 - "I can't get a job, I can't get a job."
72:13 - - Me personally, I would
not be on this channel.
72:16 - - Yeah, they just cry, man.
72:17 - Everybody just cries too
much, bitches too much.
72:19 - But, go ahead.
72:20 - - I had the same exact issue.
72:22 - I'm currently a graduate student
at Georgia Tech right now,
72:26 - and I applied to 50 jobs,
and I got three responses.
72:29 - One was in Compton, and
two I was uninterested in.
72:32 - And, that's when I reached out to Qazi,
72:33 - and then I ended up here.
72:35 - - From Instagram, dude.
72:36 - - From the connection.
From the connection to him.
72:37 - - This guy reached out to me
72:39 - about 84 weeks ago on Instagram.
72:40 - Then reached out to me again
72:41 - about 40 weeks ago, 50 weeks ago.
72:42 - - Because I met him face to face one time,
72:45 - and that held more weight than being
72:49 - at one of the top schools
for computer science
72:51 - and applying to 50 jobs
in a city as big as L.A.,
72:55 - which I thought was
abundant with opportunity.
72:56 - - Yup.
72:57 - - But, a little bit harder.
72:59 - I mean my resume might
have been different.
73:00 - - How long have you been working here?
73:04 - - Five months? Six months?
73:06 - Just over five months.
73:07 - - How long do you feel?
73:12 - How do you feel?
73:13 - - How do I feel now?
73:14 - - Yeah.
73:15 - - Amazing.
73:16 - - Working here for six months,
what do you think about
73:17 - the decision you made
working here for six months?
73:19 - Do you think...?
73:20 - - The best decision
I've made since my move.
73:23 - The break-up, the move.
73:30 - Qazi, Clever Programmer.
73:32 - - .com
73:34 - - Turned into my testimonial.
73:35 - - That's right.
73:39 - - I mean, arguably I could've gotten
73:40 - similar experiences from other locations.
73:43 - (laughs)
73:47 - but, Qazi's not bad.
73:48 - - There is the truth.
73:49 - That's the truth, guys.
73:51 - I think that whether you went here,
73:55 - or you went somewhere else,
73:56 - you would get real world experience.
73:58 - - Yeah I would be working on a
different skillset right now.
74:00 - - You get real world experience
74:01 - when you do real world things.
74:03 - So, I wanna emphasize two
take-aways from these two people.
74:08 - The big takeaway from Tenzin was apply-
74:11 - that guy applied to a 100
jobs to Facebook engineer,
74:13 - and never gave up, that's very powerful.
74:16 - Most people start bitching
and moaning way before that.
74:19 - - Berkeley grad.
74:20 - - The important take away that
Aaron was trying to convey
74:22 - was that that guy was a Berkeley grad,
74:26 - and from a 100 applications,
he got zero jobs.
74:31 - The only place he got the job
from was from a relationship.
74:35 - - And that got him into Facebook.
74:36 - - That got him into Facebook.
74:38 - - Not some random company.
74:39 - Facebook.
74:40 - - [Frankie] He was hiking, by the way.
74:42 - That guy was hiking when he
met the Facebook clinician.
74:44 - - He was hiking when he got
the Facebook connection.
74:48 - - Yeah, Frankie was there with him.
74:49 - - That's insane!
74:50 - He was outdoors, not in
his fucking basement.
74:53 - - That is insane.
74:57 - - Even today, in the Lyft,
75:00 - while I was in the Lyft,
75:01 - if it was like 10 years ago,
75:03 - I would not talk to that Uber guy.
75:05 - At all.
75:06 - I'd just be like, "Hey, what's up man."
75:08 - And I would just be on my
phone or doing something else.
75:12 - Now, every time I take Lyft,
I make it a fucking mission
75:17 - to talk to the guy and
find out more about him,
75:20 - and that's how I knew he was a trader.
75:23 - And he has YouTube channels.
75:24 - At first, when he said, "I'm
actually pretty good at it,"
75:27 - I knew he was good because he
said it in a very humble way.
75:32 - Not like the fake
humble, like real humble.
75:35 - - [Aaron] Humble confidence.
75:36 - - Because so many people-
75:40 - Dude, you're a humble guy,
75:41 - dude, what the hell are you talking about?
75:43 - - Wrapped in arrogance.
75:48 - - Did you just hear what I said?
75:50 - - Yeah, "It's on my YouTube
channel." Jesus Christ, so calm.
75:52 - I would freak the fuck
out. Like repeat that.
75:55 - - Bro, what'd you say? YouTube?
75:56 - Did you say YouTube?
75:57 - He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
75:59 - And then start's spelling it out.
76:01 - - I don't know why
people are just so calm.
76:02 - - I whip out my phone, I'm like,
76:03 - "G-H-G-I-T-C-H" or something like that.
76:07 - - Jesus.
76:08 - - [Aaron] Can we pull it up?
76:09 - - I forgot, but I could
probably go in the history.
76:11 - - It's fine.
76:12 - - It's gonna take too long.
76:14 - I pulled it up, dude, I kid you not.
76:17 - I'll show you later.
76:19 - $1700 in six minutes.
76:21 - The title was, "Watch me make
a quick $1700 in six minutes."
76:26 - And it's a live trading,
it's not like fake shit,
76:28 - fake screenshots or whatever.
76:30 - It's live trading.
76:31 - Not just one video, all
his videos were like,
76:34 - "Qatch me flip $3600 in 17 minutes."
76:39 - I'm like, "What the-"
76:41 - And then in the beginning I
didn't believe anything he said.
76:44 - After I saw all of those, I believed him.
76:48 - And then when he said,
76:49 - "yeah I just drive Lyft
for fun, man," yeah.
76:53 - I'm like, "Wow, wow."
76:59 - - He's driving Lyft for a
position of fucking power.
77:02 - Jesus.
77:04 - (laughs)
77:06 - - And that's what I wrote
about, on the airplane.
77:09 - Because the experience was
so... different and crazy.
77:14 - - Oh, from Chicago.
77:15 - I got it, okay.
77:15 - - During my flight, all
the windows were down,
77:19 - curtains were down.
77:20 - What do you call them, windows?
77:23 - - [Aaron] The plastic shades?
77:26 - Shutters.
77:26 - - Yeah shades or whatever.
77:27 - I just went, dude.
77:29 - I never wrote in-flight.
77:31 - That was the first time I wrote.
77:33 - - The productivity is crazy right?
77:35 - Because there's no internet.
77:36 - - Yes.
77:37 - - And there's no form of communication.
77:39 - - I had internet.
77:39 - - But that internet sucks.
77:40 - - No, I paid.
77:41 - - I paid too, but that internet,
77:43 - besides like, maybe texting?
77:45 - I don't know about you,
77:46 - but I can't watch YouTube or anything.
77:47 - - Really?
77:48 - - Maybe it depends on the airline.
77:50 - - You tried?
77:51 - - Yeah.
77:52 - - You could do YouTube?
77:52 - - Yeah.
77:53 - - You sure.
77:54 - - 1080p.
77:55 - - Dude every internet
that I've ever paid for,
77:57 - $8, $15, $20.
77:59 - That's funny.
78:00 - - Mine was $16.
78:01 - - Yeah, even that much...
- Really?
78:03 - - But okay, that's cool.
78:05 - Awesome.
78:06 - - I was playing chess, I was playing-
78:09 - you know chess needs a lot
78:11 - of bandwidth or something like that?
78:12 - - That is absurd.
78:13 - - It needs high speed internet for that,
78:15 - and I was playing without lag
78:18 - or lateness or anything like that.
78:19 - - That's brilliant.
78:20 - - Satellites, yo.
78:21 - - That's brilliant.
78:22 - - But maybe I just got lucky, you know?
78:25 - - Correct.
78:25 - - We were just flying over a specific part
78:26 - where the internet was lit.
78:28 - - So talk to me. So you wrote?
78:30 - - Yeah, I just wrote about it.
78:32 - Yeah, because...
78:34 - - For yourself, or do
you post it somewhere.
78:36 - - No, just journaling.
78:38 - I have a list, I have ideas, whatever,
78:42 - and then publish or something.
78:43 - But I just put everything ideas.
78:45 - - But the main thing is that
78:46 - you actually started
speaking with this guy.
78:50 - - Exactly.
78:51 - - Who you would've never thought,
78:52 - and then you ended up building
this incredible relationship,
78:55 - and you were like holy shit.
78:56 - - Yeah we exchanged numbers too.
78:57 - I'm like, "Let me get your
number before we left."
79:00 - - Right.
79:01 - - And he was happy to give it to me.
79:02 - - So the Facebook
engineer is met in hiking,
79:04 - and this brilliant guy is met in an Uber.
79:07 - - Lyft.
79:08 - You're good at this shit dude.
79:10 - Come on.
79:11 - - Natural, he's a natural.
79:15 - - It's fucking Qazi!
79:16 - - First podcast and he's
just keeping us in check,
79:17 - he's like, "Yeah, yeah come on dude."
79:20 - - It gets old after five
months, right Frankie?
79:23 - (laughs)
79:25 - - Fuck you Woo Master!
79:27 - - How to start a podcast!
79:29 - - This man, Frankie and
I keep each other sane.
79:32 - Either of us in isolation
with him would've died.
79:34 - - You know that's actually
pretty cool, their relationship.
79:36 - They're almost like brothers.
79:38 - And he's the older brother.
79:39 - - But he's younger.
79:40 - - It's almost like he's the older brother.
79:41 - - Who's the older brother?
79:42 - - He's almost like his
older brother, you know?
79:43 - Like their connection, now,
over time, the dynamic.
79:46 - - Oh, okay.
79:47 - - After five months, every
time they're working.
79:49 - - That's pretty beautiful.
79:50 - - Whenever they're working on
editing a video or something,
79:52 - it's like both of them are
working on it and going hardcore.
79:56 - I love it actually.
79:57 - - I saw them setting everything
up, I was like, "Wow."
80:01 - - They're brilliant.
80:04 - - It felt warm.
80:04 - - I know, yeah.
80:06 - - Some things you can't explain it?
80:07 - It just can be felt.
80:09 - So I felt it, see what I'm saying?
80:11 - - I felt like a dad.
80:12 - One time I was leaving,
80:13 - and I was like, "All
right guys, love you."
80:14 - And then Aaron was like, "Oh, fuck you!"
80:16 - And then I closed the
door and I was smiling.
80:18 - - Fuck you dad!
80:19 - - But he was just joking, and I need that.
80:21 - - Somebody's gonna get hurt!
80:22 - - When I was leaving I was like, "Man."
80:23 - I felt pretty warm.
80:24 - I was like, "Damn, that's
actually pretty cool."
80:27 - - Yeah, I left a great message.
I was like, "Fuck you!"
80:31 - (laughs)
80:32 - - He just fucking took
out his anger on me.
80:34 - Yeah, so.
80:37 - Basically, whether Uber fucking guy,
80:39 - or whether it's the, engineer.
80:43 - They're gonna be outside, man.
80:44 - They're not sitting in
your goddamn basement,
80:46 - so get out out of your fucking basement.
80:48 - - No matter how good your resume is,
80:49 - one random connection while
80:50 - you're doing something fun is way better.
80:52 - - Like everybody-
80:53 - I got a message today, and it was like,
80:54 - "What would you value a CS degree?"
80:56 - And I had my Instagram right here,
80:58 - and I was zooming in to my face,
81:00 - and I went like this and I was like.
81:04 - And the video ended,
81:05 - and I got so much
backlash on my Instagram,
81:08 - but I fought everybody
in their fucking Dms.
81:10 - - Right.
81:11 - - And...
81:12 - Basically it's gonna give you
a lot of pain to hear that,
81:15 - that it's worth zero,
81:17 - but it's actually not even worth zero,
81:19 - it's worth negative $40,000.
81:22 - - If you go to a normal school.
81:23 - - I'm actually being nice.
81:24 - - But if you go to private,
81:26 - you know, lead level schools,
it's like $300,000, $200,000.
81:29 - - Yeah, negative $300,000,
negative $200,000.
81:33 - John Sonmez made three million
dollars from Pluralsight.
81:36 - I'm about to make my first
fucking million, so like.
81:41 - You know?
81:43 - This guy has made multiple six figures
81:45 - from fucking coding, okay?
81:47 - So have I from just
coding and freelancing.
81:51 - There are so many developers.
81:52 - Brad Hussey, right?
81:53 - This guy is making half
a million dollars a year.
81:55 - - Yeah, something like that.
81:56 - - Right?
81:57 - - He's doing a lot.
81:58 - You know he's on Instagram now?
82:00 - - I knew he was on Instagram,
82:02 - I've been messaging him on Instagram,
82:03 - that's where I met him.
82:04 - - No, I'm talking about ads.
82:06 - - I didn't know about that.
82:07 - - Ig and Facebook ads.
82:08 - - [Aaron] Brad Hussey.
82:10 - - That's dope.
82:11 - That's actually dope, I didn't know that.
82:12 - - And I saw his video.
82:13 - Pretty good video.
82:15 - - He's gonna make great videos, I'm sure.
82:16 - But like guys, this is
the world around you.
82:19 - We need to wake the fuck up.
82:22 - A Harvard graduate isn't even
82:24 - making that much money, you know?
82:27 - But it's what everybody's goal is, right?
82:29 - We met a developer today,
82:30 - and he's happy making
$1500 or $2000 a month.
82:33 - He's way more than happy.
82:34 - - What, Facebook engineer's making $1500?
82:38 - - No, no, no, not Facebook
engineer, it's another one.
82:40 - But he freelances, and he travels
82:42 - around the world with his wife,
82:44 - and he's worked with some great companies.
82:45 - Apparently we can't say
82:46 - the name of the company because it's...
82:49 - - NDA, whatever.
82:49 - Sure, sure.
82:50 - - Right, whatever, right?
82:51 - So he's working on some great company.
82:53 - Let's just say it's a
company like Docker, okay?
82:56 - Pretty good company, Docker.
82:57 - - Sure, yeah.
82:58 - - Or Heroku.
82:59 - - $2000 a month?
83:01 - - He's freelancing, he didn't say exactly
83:04 - what the number was, but the
way he spoke, I got the vibe.
83:07 - I don't know why the fuck everybody's
83:09 - trying to hide their fucking numbers.
83:10 - What the fuck is gonna happen
if you just fucking tell
83:13 - another person how much
money you're fucking making?
83:15 - What is this bullshit?
83:16 - I never understand it, okay?
83:18 - If you're making $2000 a month,
83:20 - somebody asks you just tell them,
83:21 - "I'm making $2000 a month."
83:23 - - Or, make more money.
83:25 - - The only people who hide their money
83:27 - are people who are very
insecure about who they are,
83:31 - they tie all their identity to the money.
83:33 - Those are the people.
83:34 - And you know that they're
not making any money,
83:36 - they never wanna tell you how much money.
83:37 - - And because of that mindset,
they'll never make money.
83:39 - - You'll never make money.
83:40 - Because you already have
the mindset of hiding stuff.
83:45 - If you hide stuff, you'll lose.
83:46 - The only way to win is by
providing so much value,
83:49 - that sometimes you screw yourself over,
83:51 - but in the long run, you'll win.
83:53 - But people, when you ask
them these type of questions,
83:55 - and they hide, you generally know
83:57 - why they're working at the
place they're working at.
83:59 - But anyway, I asked
this guy multiple times,
84:01 - straight on, directly,
camera pointing at his face,
84:05 - "Exactly, monthly, what is your income?"
84:08 - And he's like, "Well..."
84:10 - He's like, "If you were traveling in Asia
84:12 - and all these other
countries, you'll be making-"
84:15 - He's like, "You'll be making
around $1500 to $2000 a month.
84:18 - You're gonna be living a
pretty great lifestyle."
84:21 - By which I understood it to be
84:23 - that he was making around
$1500 to $2000 a month.
84:27 - And he said, "Not only do
you get to keep the money."
84:29 - - Maybe he just does a part time.
84:31 - - Right, he is working part time.
84:32 - And he said, "You get to keep profit."
84:34 - He said, "You get to even save money,
84:36 - and you get to enjoy yourself."
84:37 - - That's actually pretty smart.
84:38 - - And you get to enjoy yourself.
84:41 - - I don't have any problem
with people who have jobs,
84:44 - people who go to college.
84:45 - - I don't either.
84:46 - - No problem whatsoever. If you are happy-
84:48 - - Yes.
84:49 - - With your work, you're
passionate about it,
84:52 - and you have all your needs fulfilled.
84:56 - And at the end of the
day, if you're happy,
84:59 - like actually happy,
and you feel fulfilled?
85:02 - - Right.
85:03 - - It doesn't matter, dude.
85:04 - You can have a job and
that's perfectly fine.
85:06 - - That's correct.
85:07 - - That's perfectly fine.
85:10 - There's so many people in this
world who have jobs right now
85:12 - at this very moment who are
very happy with their jobs
85:15 - and look forward to going to their jobs.
85:17 - But, here's the thing.
85:19 - Most people don't like their jobs.
85:21 - - [Qazi] Most people hate their jobs.
85:22 - - Hate their jobs, exactly.
85:24 - They dread waking up at whatever time
85:26 - and they dread doing everything,
85:28 - and they still stay at
that job for like 15 years.
85:33 - - Right.
85:34 - - Now that?
85:35 - That is...
85:36 - - I never understood, what the fuck.
85:37 - - For a 10 percent raise.
85:38 - - For a 10 percent raise.
85:39 - - That's a one dollar raise a year.
85:41 - - And they go crazy over that.
85:43 - They get crazy over that.
85:44 - It's how people go crazy over coupons.
85:47 - They go nuts.
85:48 - Five dollar savings from
some crazy complex way.
85:52 - They go fucking lose their goddamn minds.
85:55 - And I never understand why
that happens with people.
85:58 - But, like, it breaks my heart.
86:00 - You know my thing is,
86:01 - yes you can be happy
doing a full time job.
86:04 - You can be happy going to college.
86:05 - It's just that if you
know what you're doing,
86:09 - and you know why you're doing it,
86:11 - and then you're doing it anyway?
86:12 - That's okay.
86:13 - - It's wearing off.
86:14 - - What's wearing off?
86:15 - - Keep going, keep going.
86:16 - No, no, no keep going.
86:17 - - Oh, I know what's wearing off.
86:18 - Okay, so I'm thinking
those are the only people-
86:27 - If you know what you're doing
86:28 - why you're doing it, that's okay.
86:30 - But, if you want a certain thing,
86:35 - then you're going to college,
86:37 - but that doesn't map to what you want.
86:39 - - Right.
86:39 - - The high income, the free lifestyle.
86:41 - The multiple job opportunities.
86:44 - It doesn't map to what you want?
86:45 - That's the only time we're saying-
86:48 - We're not even saying "drop out"
86:50 - we're just saying, just reevaluate.
86:55 - Most people have their parents
86:57 - pressuring them to do something.
86:58 - Most people have somebody,
their external pressure.
87:00 - Their friends are gonna
laugh at them or whatever.
87:02 - So if they just take the path,
87:05 - instead of taking the road less traveled,
87:08 - if they take the same
path as everybody else,
87:10 - then, even if they get shitted on,
87:12 - they're okay because at
least nobody can tell them,
87:15 - "I told you so."
87:16 - - Right.
87:17 - Right.
87:18 - Exactly.
87:20 - And here's the thing.
87:21 - The sad part...
87:27 - When you do something, here's the thing.
87:29 - Everybody has a passion.
87:30 - - Correct.
87:34 - - When I was in high school,
I wanted to be a musician.
87:36 - - Yup.
87:37 - - And I wanted to play
guitar and everything.
87:38 - - This guy plays sick ass guitar,
87:39 - he has a beautiful fucking voice.
87:40 - He's literally a legend.
87:42 - - All right dude, come on, dude.
87:43 - - And he'll never talk about it
87:44 - because he's fucking Asian, just like you.
87:45 - And he's an incredible
drummer, 13 goddamn years.
87:48 - I can't play any instruments, I suck.
87:50 - - [Tenzin] We know.
87:51 - - But I can play blindfold chess.
87:52 - Shut the fuck up Aaron.
87:53 - (laughs)
87:55 - - I wasn't taking part in this dude.
88:00 - What was I talking about?
88:03 - I said something about, the sad part.
88:06 - - The sad part.
88:07 - - Yeah.
88:07 - Everybody has a passion.
88:10 - When you do something that
is against your true belief-
88:16 - - Right.
88:17 - - For an extended period of time,
88:20 - that belief slowly goes away.
88:23 - - Huh.
88:24 - Damn.
88:25 - - And you die.
88:26 - - Damn.
88:27 - - You die.
88:28 - Literally, your soul dies.
88:29 - And that's why people,
after a certain point,
88:32 - they're so numb to it that
they don't quit their jobs,
88:35 - or their relationships, or whatever
88:37 - because they haven't solved it,
88:40 - but it's like almost "solved,"
in a negative way, you know?
88:46 - - Dude, it's like what they
say happens to elephants.
88:50 - - Exactly!
88:50 - - When the elephant is a little baby,
88:51 - they tie a rope around
the elephant's foot,
88:54 - and then the elephant can't break away.
88:56 - You know about that, right?
88:58 - And then, the elephant can't break away
88:59 - because that elephant is a baby,
89:01 - but then when that
elephant becomes a giant,
89:04 - he can break the shit out of that rope,
89:06 - but he never even tries
89:08 - because he thinks he can't break away,
89:10 - because he remembers when he was a baby
89:12 - he couldn't break it.
89:12 - - Isn't that fucking insane?
89:14 - - He never even tries.
89:15 - - His identity is still
that one day old elephant.
89:19 - - Yup.
89:21 - - And that's true with people as well.
89:24 - That's very true with people.
89:26 - And you have to fight
your demons, you know?
89:28 - If you don't fight your demons,
89:29 - sooner or later that
demon will fuck you up.
89:33 - And when that fucks you up, you're done.
89:38 - - Yeah.
89:38 - - Then it's really hard to come back.
89:39 - - Our demons are crazy, bro.
89:42 - Our demons are crazy.
89:43 - Like this guy?
89:44 - He's so fucking good
at so many things, but.
89:47 - - He's Asian, bro.
89:51 - - He literally has physically speaking,
89:52 - he has trouble verbally saying it.
89:57 - Or, like for example, he's
great at drumming, right,
90:01 - but the same reason he
doesn't have YouTube content
90:03 - around it, because he doesn't
think he's good enough,
90:06 - but he's a fucking beast, I bet you.
90:08 - And I feel like there are also people
90:10 - who mentally undermine themselves.
90:13 - I think he's super talented,
90:15 - but I feel like he sometimes,
like, undermines himself.
90:18 - - Exactly.
90:19 - - And it comes from childhood, right?
90:21 - Because our parents, even when
we got As, A+s, they're like,
90:27 - "You got only 98. Why
didn't you get a 100?"
90:30 - - My parents did that shit, yeah.
90:31 - - When you would get a 100,
my dad would look at the paper
90:34 - and it's way different from
his, way different, way harder
90:37 - like 10 times harder,
90:38 - and he would look at
the essay or whatever,
90:41 - and it's 100 percent, everybody
else, not 100 percent.
90:47 - He would look at it and just
go, "Look at that handwriting."
90:52 - (laughs)
90:55 - - Only my mom's Asian.
90:56 - - It echos in my head to this day, bro.
90:59 - - Nothing is good enough.
91:01 - - "Look at that handwriting."
91:02 - - That's the definition.
91:03 - - [Aaron] Nothing's ever good enough.
91:05 - - My mom?
91:05 - Even when I got third, she'd
be like wow, you got in third.
91:08 - Like top three she's okay, you know?
91:10 - Top four, no.
91:11 - Top four, still not good.
91:13 - Not enough for Mom.
91:14 - But top three is enough.
91:15 - For Dad?
91:16 - Nothing was good enough.
91:18 - So...
91:21 - - You know what they say?
91:22 - - What did I do?
91:24 - - No, I'm actually adding on.
91:26 - - Oh, okay you were looking
in a very suspicious way,
91:29 - you know?
91:30 - Staring at me.
91:32 - - They said...
91:32 - Excellence is accepted,
and greatness is tolerated.
91:36 - That's the framework of certain parents.
91:43 - - That's a pretty fucked
up way to raise your kids,
91:46 - you know what I'm saying?
91:47 - - It's pretty fucked up.
91:47 - - I mean, I'm glad they did so...
91:49 - - You know, my biggest
hack that I discovered?
91:51 - You know, like the low
expectations shit that I do?
91:54 - And it's like my ultimate hack
91:55 - that just gets me going
in all areas of life?
91:58 - I figured this shit out
at a young age, okay?
92:01 - - Son, you did drugs?
92:02 - Aww man, thank God, I
thought you killed somebody.
92:06 - - I thought you killed somebody!
92:08 - - Or you got a guy pregnant or something!
92:09 - - Got a guy pregnant!
92:12 - That's fucking hilarious.
92:14 - That's fucking funny, that's funny.
92:17 - What I started doing, I
realized at a very young age
92:19 - what had started happening, I got Cs?
92:22 - They cried.
92:22 - I got Bs?
92:23 - They cried.
92:24 - I got all As, one class I
got like a A- or like a B,
92:28 - they were like, "Why'd you
get a B in that class?"
92:30 - They just ignored all the As.
92:32 - I'm like, "This is fucked."
92:34 - Like I can never win.
92:35 - And the only reason I got those grades
92:37 - was just to see their reactions.
92:38 - So then I realized that
nothing I did mattered,
92:41 - so then I started doing the opposite.
92:43 - I started getting Fs and Ds,
92:45 - I came home late like, in high school.
92:47 - I started coming home at like
2:00, 3:00am late every night.
92:49 - My parents hated me for this period.
92:52 - They were like, "You're coming late,
92:54 - what the hell's wrong with you?
92:56 - You're not getting your grades right."
92:57 - But I just systematically
kept chipping away,
93:00 - chipping away, chipping away.
93:01 - But what I was really chipping away at
93:03 - was their ridiculous expectations of me,
93:06 - and bringing them down.
93:07 - Bro, now?
93:10 - - That's like a win.
93:11 - - Bro, now?
93:12 - It's like if I just call them
93:13 - and they just find out I'm alive?
93:16 - My dad starts fucking crying of happiness.
93:17 - - Right.
93:19 - - It's a beautiful experience.
93:21 - I, at a very young age,
stopped giving a fuck
93:25 - about their opinions of me,
in a very respectful way,
93:29 - just so I could be free
to do my own thing.
93:33 - - Right.
93:34 - - Whereas my middle brother, I love him,
93:35 - but he couldn't be free of that.
93:37 - Maybe it's circumstance, maybe it's luck,
93:39 - all those things combined.
93:40 - I'm not gonna take that away.
93:41 - Sometimes you can get lucked out, too.
93:43 - But I chipped away at it
93:44 - because I realized that
this game is just rigged.
93:46 - This game you're always gonna
lose, with those parents.
93:49 - Always gonna lose.
93:50 - And so, I gave up on it,
and now my relationship
93:54 - with parents has never been better.
93:55 - Like many, many years later, right?
93:57 - I'm 24 now, I've been fucking
93:58 - chipping away at it since I was like, 13.
94:00 - - [Tenzin] Right.
94:01 - - So it's like, 11 years of hard work.
94:04 - And, now, I go back and
literally anything I do-
94:10 - Like they found out I
have a white girlfriend,
94:12 - and they would've flipped.
94:14 - I brought it up on the phone.
94:16 - Did I tell you?
94:17 - - Yeah you did, yeah.
94:17 - - Yeah.
94:18 - - I have not heard this story.
94:19 - Continue, continue.
94:20 - - This is crazy.
94:22 - - So my mom and my dad, they
were like, "Where are you?"
94:23 - I'm like, "I'm at the airport."
94:24 - They're like, "Where are you going?"
94:26 - I'm like, "Argentina."
94:27 - They're like, "But weren't you supposed
94:28 - to come to Eid, like, with us."
94:30 - And I was like, "No, I'm actually
94:32 - going to Argentina with my girlfriend."
94:34 - My mom flipped on the phone, bro.
94:36 - My dad came, both of
them were going crazy.
94:39 - But because, to them, I'm such a dumbass
94:44 - and I do so many crazy things,
like jumping off the plane
94:47 - and shit, which in
their mind is like nuts,
94:49 - when I went back to my
mom, my mom just loved me.
94:51 - My dad just loved me,
because now their barrier is,
94:57 - "If this person is
alive, we just love him."
94:59 - But as a result, I've been
the best version of myself,
95:02 - I've been the most confident
95:03 - because I got to make my own decisions,
95:05 - and I became much more successful
95:07 - than if I was just living under their roof
95:10 - and doing everything that they said.
95:13 - So like that whole low expectations thing,
95:15 - I do it in everything.
95:16 - I'm like, "I'm gonna do this crazy shit."
95:18 - And you guys are like,
"What's gonna be the result?"
95:20 - I'm like, "I'm gonna get two subscribers
95:22 - and it's gonna be fucking unbelievable."
95:23 - - And isn't it crazy?
95:24 - That shaped your identity.
- It did.
95:27 - - Like that's insane.
95:28 - That little thing.
95:29 - I mean it's not little, but...
95:32 - When you don't think about it,
95:33 - it's just like, oh it's insignificant.
95:36 - - Yeah.
95:37 - - But... Every day.
- Yup.
95:40 - - For years.
95:41 - - Yup.
95:42 - - [Aaron] Yeah.
95:43 - - This guy does it with everything.
95:44 - He's like, "Hmm, let me think."
95:45 - - Yeah.
95:47 - (laughs)
95:49 - - Yeah dude, I tried to
chip away too, I'm with you.
95:52 - I tried to chip away
95:53 - but I would get a
roundhouse kick, you know?
95:55 - So, that would...
95:56 - I didn't chip away.
95:58 - I wasn't successful until like
17, and then I started to.
96:01 - It started to work because I was here,
96:03 - and I was like, "What, there's a law?"
96:05 - - Yeah, protecting you?
96:07 - - Emancipated, baby!
96:11 - - Yeah, and that's the thing, you know?
96:14 - This is where I say luck
96:16 - and circumstance has to play a role.
96:18 - So like, I just got a
little bit more lucky
96:20 - where my dad and mom
wouldn't start beating me up.
96:24 - I mean I went to religious
school for four years,
96:26 - that was like torture chamber
for like four years straight,
96:28 - but my parents never actually
beat the fuck out of me.
96:33 - And so that, I had the room
to do that, you didn't.
96:36 - You didn't, right?
96:38 - If you had tried, your dad would like
96:40 - find you and kick the shit out of you.
96:41 - - Right.
96:42 - With love, of course, but, you know.
96:45 - - Always, always.
96:46 - - Yeah.
96:47 - - I mean, we got kicked every day,
96:49 - like when my dad kicked
me it's like, yeah.
96:52 - - [Aaron] It's another day.
96:53 - - It's just another day.
96:54 - - [Aaron] He still loves me.
96:56 - - Yeah, but.
96:58 - Yeah, so that's fucked, right?
96:59 - And then it makes it really tough for you,
97:01 - but then we have like different things
97:03 - that take place from there.
97:05 - Like your standard of excellence is more,
97:08 - the work you put in to
achieve that excellence,
97:12 - your inner drive, actually,
97:15 - when you actually dedicate it to something
97:17 - it's gonna be more than
mine, because your dad
97:20 - trained you in what some might
consider a fucked up way.
97:23 - But I just look at it like
it just is what it is.
97:26 - - It just is what it is.
97:27 - I used to look at it in
a fucked up way, too.
97:29 - But now, it's just.
97:31 - - Because of that, his intensity
is one of the strongest
97:34 - I know, and you also have
really high intensity.
97:36 - That's why I always say that you remind me
97:38 - of my friend Tenzin when
you're actually in something,
97:41 - you both have a high level of intensity.
97:43 - - You sure it's not
because we're just Asians?
97:46 - - It probably could be that.
97:47 - - Oh, okay, okay.
- Kinda racist dude.
97:49 - - But I think parental pressure
has to do something with,
97:55 - I could be wrong, but I
feel like parental pressure
97:57 - has to do with the level of intensity.
97:59 - That's why so many Asian kids
with like insane parents-
98:01 - - I 100 percent agree.
98:02 - - Like, are beasts.
98:03 - - Just like I said, that
shaped your identity,
98:05 - what your parents did.
98:07 - With you, and then the same thing with me.
98:09 - And I'm sure the same thing with him.
98:10 - - A little bit different.
98:12 - - But, the pattern is still the same.
98:14 - The why, the root cause of everything.
98:18 - I think for most people, it is,
because you're a little kid.
98:23 - - Yup.
98:23 - - You get morphed into whatever.
98:25 - - Yeah malleable.
98:25 - - Whatever you see.
98:27 - You see something, you're
like, "Oh, let me try that."
98:30 - You look at your dad,
you're like, you know what?
98:31 - Let me try that.
98:33 - And for you, your two
brothers, your older brother.
98:35 - You had a balance sheet,
like trial bounds.
98:37 - - Yeah.
98:38 - - Yeah, you were third try.
98:40 - - That's right.
98:42 - - What's that called?
98:42 - See saw.
98:43 - - I was the best mistake ever made.
98:44 - - Balance.
98:46 - - Like, when you look at his
older brother, it's like,
98:47 - "Hmm, that's pretty good,
but that's not that good.
98:49 - Lemme go to the other side."
98:50 - - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
98:52 - - Younger brother, "Mmm, that shit's lit,
98:53 - lemme try to be more hip, you know?
98:56 - Oh, leather jacket, oh
yeah, okay, cool, cool."
98:59 - But that part I don't really like,
99:01 - so let me balance that off, you know?
99:03 - I gotta be a little more disappointed.
99:05 - And then that perfectly
balanced out, dude.
99:07 - - That's right, that's right.
99:09 - - And that's how he grew his beard.
99:10 - - And then I just stole it from.
99:11 - (laughs)
99:13 - And then I'm like, "Hmm, interesting.
99:15 - I like it. I like what I see."
99:17 - And I'm like, "All right, all right.
99:19 - I gotta talk to this guy."
99:21 - - Our influence on each
others life is probably
99:26 - more influence than anybody
has had on anyone ever.
99:29 - - Ever.
99:30 - - Right?
99:31 - - You guys met in undergrad, right?
99:32 - In community college.
99:34 - - We met in community college.
99:35 - - Hearing that word is so weird!
99:37 - Undergrad?
- Undergrad.
99:38 - - Oakton!
99:39 - - Cause you were about to
say, "No, no, no," right?
99:42 - - I was about to say, no, like.
99:44 - - High school, high school, high school!
99:45 - - Undergrad?
99:46 - - Yeah!
99:47 - - That is undergrad.
99:48 - - Yeah, that is undergrad.
- That's crazy!
99:49 - And we met because of chess!
99:50 - - I was at Oakton Community College
99:52 - with a 2.0 GPA making six figures.
99:54 - (laughs)
99:56 - - How many times have you written that.
99:58 - - Like a lot.
- A lot.
99:59 - - [Tenzin] A lot, dude.
99:59 - - Like how many times have
you typed that copy out.
100:02 - - Because you know, once
you keep saying the story,
100:03 - you keep saying it so much.
100:05 - Like Gary talks about his story.
100:07 - - It's good.
100:08 - That's how you become a great speaker,
100:10 - because you just speak a lot, you know?
100:11 - And then you also become
a better copywriter
100:14 - because you have all these
things that you memorize,
100:16 - and after a while you don't
have to use your brain power
100:18 - to memorize these things, you
can go think of something new.
100:23 - - When I write ads it's pattern
recognition at this point.
100:29 - - I believe it.
- You know what I mean?
100:31 - It's like not even that much thinking.
100:32 - - I know, I believe you.
100:33 - - Yeah.
100:36 - - I've seen you do it.
100:42 - But man, this was a good podcast.
100:44 - - This was great.
100:44 - - It was.
100:45 - - This was actually phenomenal.
100:46 - - I mean, we had a lot of...
100:48 - We covered a lot of topics, but you know?
100:52 - I liked it.
- A lot of ground.
100:53 - - Yeah.
100:54 - - I love.
100:55 - - A lot of false starts,
a lot of false ends.
100:56 - - I went from like having,
in the beginning energy,
101:01 - to like no energy, and then high energy,
101:04 - and then low energy.
101:06 - - He was like a wave, yeah.
101:09 - - You had really good energy
throughout, that was great.
101:11 - - No, your energy was
the best, you know why?
101:13 - - Thanks bro.
- Because yours was constant.
101:14 - - I appreciate it.
101:15 - - Mine's like, you know-
101:21 - - Some topics are lit, you know?
101:23 - - I mean you have to
be like that, you know?
101:24 - - Back to reality, back to reality.
101:25 - - You have to be like
that to be a podcast host.
101:27 - - Yeah.
101:27 - - Because I'm not gonna do it, fuck that.
101:29 - You think I'm gonna do it?
101:31 - Fuck that.
101:31 - I'm probably not gonna do
it in my own podcast dude.
101:35 - (laughs)
101:36 - I'm gonna be the one going
off on tangents like,
101:41 - "Tell me about that part!"
101:42 - You know?
- Right.
101:43 - People like that too, dude.
101:44 - People love that.
101:45 - Everybody has all kinds of podcasts.
101:47 - - Sure, but I don't like it.
101:51 - - Your current...
101:52 - - No, I go off on tangents
a little too much.
101:54 - - I'm kind of in the same boat.
101:56 - - That's why you said
you're the same as me, huh?
101:59 - - Yeah, that is the issue.
102:02 - - All right guys, this was phenomenal.
102:08 - All right, bro.
102:09 - - I don't do handshakes dude, come on.
102:10 - Come on, baby!
102:13 - - Frankie? Frankie!
102:15 - All right guys, no, no keep it rolling.
102:17 - Is it rolling?
102:18 - All right guys, thank you so much.
102:20 - This was the first.
102:22 - - Ever!
102:23 - - Kind of official podcast.
102:24 - Let's call this the
Profitable Programmers Show.
102:26 - We had Aaron Bernath,
102:28 - who's our product developer
at Cleverprogrammer.com.
102:33 - We had Tenzin Phuljung,
102:35 - aka Zennie, founder of whatsdev.com.
102:39 - You can find him on YouTube,
he has an Instagram as well,
102:43 - let's pop his Instagram,
let's pop his Instagram.
