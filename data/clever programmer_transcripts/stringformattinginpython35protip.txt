00:00 - hey guys what's up this is Kazi from
00:02 - clever programmer comm and today i'm
00:04 - coming at you with a pro tip in this
00:15 - video i want to show you guys the beauty
00:17 - of something called format and all the
00:20 - cool kids are using it so let's just get
00:22 - started here's how it works i will say
00:25 - something and like a quote or a string
00:29 - with the two quotation marks around it
00:31 - and i will pass in dot format and if i
00:35 - said five here's what it will do this
00:38 - squiggly brackets that you see it's
00:39 - using that as a placeholder and in place
00:42 - of that ill put in whatever i pass to
00:45 - the format method so if I pass in five
00:47 - you'll say hello world five if I pass in
00:49 - ten it'll pass in ten so a cool example
00:54 - of this would be if I wanted to do count
00:57 - from one to ten and I wanted to say the
00:59 - word count and then I wanted to say one
01:01 - after it so for example I wanted
01:02 - something to look like this and then in
01:06 - the next one to look like this well
01:09 - whoops I'm sorry to look like this okay
01:13 - so I can do that very easily I can write
01:16 - a for loop that starts from one and
01:19 - let's say it goes all the way up to
01:21 - eleven
01:22 - it goes up to but not including eleven
01:26 - however it does start from one which
01:27 - means it'll print one and it will go up
01:29 - to ten but not 11
01:31 - all right let's hit this guy here and I
01:34 - will say print I or I'm sorry print
01:38 - count because that's something I want to
01:42 - show and I want to put that right there
01:45 - the squiggly brackets and I can say doc
01:47 - format hmm and from that I can put I
01:51 - because that's our variable we're
01:52 - incrementing by and I'm gonna hit enter
01:54 - a few times and you can see count one
01:56 - count to count three count four count
01:58 - five all up to ten how beautiful does
02:01 - that look pretty damn beautiful how can
02:04 - you use it well if you're making a game
02:05 - like battleships or something else you
02:08 - can use this to format your code instead
02:10 - of those % placeholders or
02:12 - instead of doing something like hello
02:14 - world plus one and then you realize it
02:18 - gives you an error because you can't
02:20 - combine a number with the string so you
02:22 - got a pass STR around it which is again
02:25 - something that's ugly then you're like
02:26 - oh it's still not formatted correctly so
02:29 - you got to put this space after it and
02:31 - it's it's a whole mess instead use the
02:35 - format way look at how gorgeous that is
02:38 - first of all look at that and it just
02:41 - works right I don't know where I got
02:43 - those syntax or front but it works
02:46 - that's it for this video I'll see you
02:48 - guys in the next video
