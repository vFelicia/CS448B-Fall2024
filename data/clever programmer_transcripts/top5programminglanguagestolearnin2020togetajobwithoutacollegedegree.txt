00:00 - - Top five programming
languages for you to learn
00:03 - in 2020 to get a job without
even needing a college degree.
00:09 - I make a video on this
topic every single year,
00:13 - and you guys seem to eat it up.
00:15 - A video I made in 2018 got
over two million views,
00:19 - and another one I made in 2019
got over one million views.
00:24 - I just wanna say thank you so much,
00:26 - I love your beautiful face.
00:27 - I love the support that
you give to this channel.
00:30 - Let's continue.
00:31 - Now, just like my last few
videos, we are going to
00:34 - be ranking the programming
languages on three main factors.
00:39 - Number one, the time it
takes for you learn, even if
00:43 - you're a complete beginner,
and make real-world projects.
00:47 - Number two, the job market.
00:49 - What is the demand and the
overall salary that you can make
00:53 - with this programming language in 2020?
00:56 - And number three, what is
your overall productivity
01:00 - going to be with this
programming language?
01:02 - This really matters when it comes to
01:04 - your own personal development with coding.
01:07 - How fast can you build
real-world projects?
01:10 - And when you're working at
startups and smaller companies,
01:13 - they need people to be able
to build real applications
01:16 - in a much shorter amount of time.
01:18 - By the way, I would
love if you help me beat
01:21 - the YouTube algorithm, it's
been destroying my channel.
01:24 - If you wanna help me do
that, smash that Like button.
01:27 - Like, no, like really just go and destroy
01:29 - that Like button, okay, right now.
01:34 - Please subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already,
01:36 - and let's keep going.
01:38 - What's up guys, this is Qazi
from cleverprogrammer.com.
01:41 - Now, before we get into the
meat and potatoes of this video
01:43 - and we talk about different languages,
01:44 - there are multiple
programming languages where
01:47 - you can make over $100,000 year.
01:50 - Before we get into that,
01:51 - I do wanna let you know
that I have put together
01:53 - a really amazing three-part
masterclass for you,
01:57 - especially if you wanna
01:58 - become a freelance developer
and be on your path
02:01 - to go from zero to six figures per year.
02:05 - The way you can get your
hands onto that training is
02:08 - by clicking the link
below in the description
02:10 - and signing up for it.
02:12 - The best part, it's absolutely free,
02:14 - so go ahead and do that now.
02:16 - Let's continue.
02:17 - Number 5, Java.
02:20 - Java, Java, Java.
02:21 - It's a pretty amazing programming language
02:24 - that a lot of people know.
02:26 - This is a object-oriented
programming language,
02:29 - and this is used in lots
of Android applications.
02:33 - That's one of the primary reasons
02:35 - why people use Java as of even today.
02:38 - Lots of big companies
are still using Java.
02:41 - There are lots of trading
applications made with it as well.
02:45 - It's currently declining a
little bit in popularity because
02:49 - of programming languages like
Kotlin, which you can now use
02:52 - to create Android applications in.
02:54 - This is why, if you look at
the Google Trends, you will see
02:58 - in the last five years
Java has a little decline.
03:01 - Outside of that, there's still
lots of jobs that are offered
03:04 - for Java, and the salary for
an average Java developer
03:07 - in the United States is $103,000 a year
03:12 - according to indeed.com.
03:14 - Number four, Swift.
03:16 - Swift is a iOS programming
language that is used for Apple.
03:21 - If you ever dreamed of
making a app that shows up
03:24 - in the App Store, ranks
highly, or you wanna be able
03:27 - to make, you know, the dream
of every developer ever,
03:30 - make monthly recurring
income or passive income
03:33 - from a app that they
created with passion, love,
03:36 - and heart, and put it
out in the app store,
03:39 - and people in the Apple world
can download it and use it,
03:43 - that is why you would learn Swift.
03:45 - Now, you can freelance with it,
03:47 - or you can get a full-time job.
03:50 - It's a very popular language.
03:53 - It's not getting more popular,
03:55 - but the great thing,
it's not also going down.
03:57 - It has been stable over
the last five years if
03:59 - you look across on Google Trends.
04:01 - That shows me that it's a very
stable programming language,
04:04 - not going anywhere, and is
great to invest your time in
04:08 - and to learn it.
04:09 - I would say it's really
beginner friendly as well.
04:11 - There are tons of tutorials on YouTube
04:13 - that support the learning of it,
04:15 - but not only that, it's a lot of fun.
04:17 - Java is a pain in the ass to learn if
04:20 - you are a complete
beginner, but I think Swift
04:23 - is a little bit easier
to learn just because
04:26 - you can make stuff and
put it on your iOS device,
04:28 - and it's a lot of fun.
04:30 - Awesome programming language.
04:32 - Average salary of a developer
in the United States
04:36 - is $115,000 a year,
according to indeed.com.
04:40 - Number three, SQL; I call it Sequel.
04:46 - Both ways are completely
fine of calling it.
04:49 - This programming language,
some people will argue
04:52 - it's not actually a programming language.
04:55 - It ultimately doesn't matter.
04:57 - This is called structured query language.
05:00 - That's what SQL stands for.
05:02 - And why I recommend learning
this, and why I think it's
05:05 - so important for everybody to
actually know some of this,
05:08 - is almost no matter what
programming language
05:10 - you're gonna work with, if you ever dream
05:13 - of creating applications
and web applications,
05:15 - you're gonna have to deal with data.
05:17 - When you have to deal with
data, you're pretty much
05:20 - not gonna get away if you
don't understand SQL, okay?
05:24 - So if you wanna make an application
05:26 - that can store data and save information?
05:29 - For example, if you go
on Instagram, right?
05:31 - When you Like somebody's comment,
05:33 - or you Like somebody's post,
that Like is stored somewhere.
05:37 - Or when you make a post
on Instagram or Facebook,
05:40 - that post is stored somewhere.
05:41 - When you log back in,
that post is still there.
05:44 - Guess what is saving your post?
05:46 - It's SQL; it's SQL being able
05:48 - to talk to databases, all right?
05:50 - So that's why I think
this programming language,
05:53 - this language, query language, is very,
05:55 - very important to learn.
05:57 - I put it at number three,
but I think this is very,
06:00 - very vital, and almost
any type of development
06:02 - you wanna do, especially
any web development
06:04 - you wanna do, whether you wanna become
06:05 - a backend developer or
a full-stack developer,
06:08 - you kinda have to know SQL.
06:11 - It will serve you really, really well.
06:13 - And the average salary of a
SQL developer is $89,000 a year
06:19 - in the United States,
according to indeed.com.
06:22 - Number 2, JavaScript.
06:25 - Ooh, this one is a controversial one.
06:27 - Everybody goes crazy.
06:28 - "Why did you pick JavaScript number two?
06:31 - "Why isn't it number one?" (mumbles)
06:34 - Everybody's gonna go
crazy in the comments.
06:36 - JavaScript, according to the PYPL index
06:39 - and the Google Trends,
JavaScript at number two
06:43 - in popularity compared to
the number one language,
06:46 - which I will be talking about after this,
06:48 - but let's get into what
can you do with JavaScript?
06:51 - JavaScript is a very incredible
programming language.
06:54 - If you have dreams and
aspirations to do anything related
06:58 - to web development,
creating web applications,
07:01 - you're probably gonna
need to learn JavaScript.
07:05 - Whether you wanna do full-stack
or front-end development
07:09 - or backend development, it would help you
07:12 - to know JavaScript to a good extent.
07:16 - JavaScript is a very popular language.
07:18 - If you even look on GitHub, there's always
07:20 - a new framework coming out for it.
07:22 - And there are tons of amazing
frameworks and libraries
07:25 - always being produced
for JavaScript, right?
07:27 - Like, for example, you got
React, people talk about Vue.js,
07:31 - there's all kinds of craziness
that goes around JavaScript.
07:35 - Even if you forget all the
trendy stuff that's happening
07:37 - around, it's just a great
programming language.
07:40 - Every web browser supports
it and runs JavaScript,
07:44 - and I think it's one
of the must-know tools
07:47 - that you need in your arsenal
when it comes to programming
07:52 - and web development especially.
07:53 - The average salary of a
JavaScript developer, according
07:57 - to indeed.com, in the United
States is $113,000 a year.
08:04 - Real quick for those of
you JavaScript nerds.
08:07 - I wanna give you a
resource that will help you
08:09 - on your journey to becoming
a JavaScript developer.
08:11 - I scour the Internet for a lot of stuff,
08:13 - you know, whether it's Udemy
or Udacity or Coursera,
08:16 - or just YouTube in general,
or some of my own courses,
08:19 - one thing I found that
is actually really useful
08:21 - is on Skillshare, I found this
course that's on JavaScript,
08:26 - and this course is very, very helpful.
08:28 - This, I think will help you.
08:30 - I would recommend for you
to check this course out.
08:33 - It looks pretty good.
08:34 - If you use the link that I
have below in the description
08:37 - for Skillshare, you'll get
actually two months of premium
08:41 - for free, so I would highly
recommend go check it out.
08:45 - Skillshare, they have
really amazing tutorials.
08:47 - This tutorial, to me, specifically,
by Chris looks useful.
08:51 - Give it a try.
08:52 - With that said, let's jump
right back into the video.
08:55 - And number one, drum roll please.
08:58 - (hands tapping)
09:01 - Python!
09:03 - Python is the number one
programming language,
09:06 - and now, it's not just
according to me anymore, guys.
09:10 - That's a beautiful thing.
09:11 - According to Google Trends
in the last five years,
09:15 - it's now officially the number
one most popular language,
09:19 - and also according to the PYPL index,
09:21 - it is the number one most
popular programming language.
09:26 - What's amazing about Python,
it's a general purpose
09:29 - programming language that you can use
09:31 - for many different things,
but it's also very powerful.
09:34 - Before I get into the use cases
of it, let me just tell you
09:37 - what types of companies use Python.
09:40 - So Google is built off of Python.
09:43 - YouTube is built off of Python.
09:45 - Dropbox, Quora, Hipmunk,
Reddit, Instagram,
09:50 - and the list goes on.
09:53 - This is just to give you
a taste of what types
09:55 - of things you can build with Python.
09:57 - So if you want to do web development,
10:00 - you could do it with Python.
10:02 - There are many different
frameworks and libraries
10:05 - in Python that support and allow you
10:08 - to do lots of data science applications.
10:12 - And the real reason why Python has become
10:14 - so goddamn popular is
because of data science.
10:17 - Data science has grown so much
10:19 - over the last few years, right?
10:20 - Like, look at the self-driving
cars, the self-checkout
10:26 - at Walmart that's being implemented,
10:28 - Google self-driving cars,
Tesla self-driving cars,
10:31 - and lots of the automation and
machine learning algorithms
10:35 - that are being done as of
today, a lot of them are being
10:38 - done in Python, and that
has skyrocketed its growth.
10:43 - Why I really put it at number one
10:46 - is because it's very beginner friendly.
10:48 - Out of all of the last four
languages that I've talked about
10:52 - this is probably the easiest to pick up.
10:54 - But the amazing thing is, you
can build real-world projects
10:58 - with Python and do that very, very fast.
11:00 - You can do web development
really well with Python
11:04 - with its frameworks, like Django or Flask,
11:08 - those are unbelievable, and you can go on
11:12 - and do data science with it as well.
11:15 - I do think the language that you pick
11:17 - and choose and stick with matters.
11:20 - It's just like where you
live matters and defines
11:24 - your culture and your accent,
and everything around you,
11:28 - and kind of the things
that you grow up to do.
11:30 - So I think the language that you start off
11:32 - with first defines a lot of
things you're gonna do, right?
11:34 - For example, if you start
with Swift and learn a lot
11:37 - of Swift, you're probably gonna
become, or much more likely
11:40 - to be influenced by,
iOS applications 'cause
11:43 - you're spending a lot
of time building them
11:46 - and learning them, and
you'll very likely end
11:48 - up doing something in the iOS section.
11:50 - If you learn Java,
you're gonna spend a lot
11:53 - of time around Android applications.
11:56 - So it's really important
what your goal is.
11:58 - If your goal is to make
Android apps, go with Java.
12:01 - If your goal is to make
iOS apps, go with Swift.
12:04 - If your goal is to just do web development
12:07 - and that's kind of it, go with JavaScript
12:09 - and stick with node.js and
all of those frameworks.
12:12 - If your goal is to just
do stuff with databases
12:14 - and become a data analyst and specialize
12:16 - in that section, go with SQL.
12:18 - But if your goal is to do
web development, or you wanna
12:21 - do machine learning or data
science, or any of those things,
12:24 - then you definitely
wanna stick with Python.
12:27 - It's easy, gives you tons of flexibility,
12:30 - and the other amazing
reason is the average salary
12:33 - for a developer in the
United States, according
12:35 - to indeed.com, is $118,000 a year.
12:40 - So there you have it, all
five programming languages
12:43 - that are incredible for
you to learn in 2020
12:46 - to get a job without even
needing a college degree,
12:50 - as long as you have the
skillset, the determination,
12:52 - and the persistence to go through.
12:55 - Please help beat the YouTube algorithm
12:58 - and give this video a Like.
12:59 - Smash that Like button,
subscribe to the channel,
13:02 - and I do have a three-part
masterclass for you
13:06 - that helps you become a
freelance developer with Python.
13:10 - Go from zero to making six figures.
