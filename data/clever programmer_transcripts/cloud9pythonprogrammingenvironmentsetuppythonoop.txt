00:00 - hey guys so for this tutorial make sure
00:03 - that you are on Python 3 because now
00:06 - we're getting into the part of the code
00:08 - where we're importing specific libraries
00:12 - from Python 3 and if you are on Python 2
00:15 - these commands actually might not work
00:17 - so either you're gonna have to follow
00:20 - this course and try to figure out online
00:22 - how to translate these lines of code
00:25 - some specific ones from Python 3 to
00:30 - Python 2 and make it work for yourself
00:31 - or I suggest upgrade to Python 3 and use
00:36 - Python 3 if you are still having
00:38 - problems and you cannot figure out any
00:42 - way to get past them then I will show
00:46 - you a very nice solution and this will
00:48 - make your life really easy though I
00:50 - encourage local development more there
00:53 - is an online solution and it's called
00:56 - c9i oh okay and let me just show you
01:00 - this very quickly this is just to make
01:02 - sure that you don't have any problems
01:04 - like worst case scenario nothing is
01:06 - working for you guaranteed this is gonna
01:08 - work so essentially on scene on dot c9
01:12 - dot IO you just go on this website and
01:15 - create a workspace so you can create any
01:18 - workspace you want I'm just gonna call
01:20 - it whatever and let's call it test and
01:26 - pick Python as your template or you
01:30 - don't even have to pick a template you
01:31 - could leave it blank it's totally up to
01:33 - you so I'm just gonna pick Python and
01:36 - then hit create workspace and then it
01:38 - just creates a full-on working
01:40 - environment for you so you can code in
01:43 - here you have a terminal that works
01:45 - perfectly just like a Linux or a Mac or
01:48 - in a bunch of system and you won't have
01:51 - any development problems no one problem
01:54 - might be that if your internet
01:55 - connection isn't working you're kind of
01:57 - screwed you can't do anything but for
02:00 - the times that your internet connection
02:01 - is working it works and another great
02:03 - thing about this is that if you switch
02:05 - from your laptop to your macbook or you
02:08 - switch to your Windows whatever wherever
02:10 - you go in the world you can even go to a
02:12 - different country you're in
02:13 - programming environment will be the same
02:16 - because it's on the cloud it's on the
02:17 - internet so on my left side you see
02:19 - there's some folders you can create your
02:22 - own folder if you want you can create a
02:25 - file so like here I'll just hit that
02:28 - plus sign do new file I'll just say
02:31 - print hello world and I will hit command
02:36 - s to save it and I'll just call it hello
02:39 - world make sure to give it that
02:41 - extension that py and for the folder it
02:44 - says it's storing it in the home folder
02:46 - well how about we just create a folder
02:49 - and call it PI thon code whoops what
02:54 - happened there
02:54 - oh it's smart it doesn't allow you to
02:57 - actually do it doesn't allow you to
03:01 - actually rename things so or sorry it
03:04 - doesn't allow you to put spaces so what
03:05 - we're gonna do is I'm just gonna create
03:07 - Python here code what's happening there
03:13 - forget all that stuff just put Python
03:16 - code do it right the first time
03:18 - basically is what to say
03:20 - unable to rename the project folder okay
03:24 - no worries we're not trying to rename
03:25 - the project folder anyways let's hit
03:28 - save there whatever I don't know where
03:30 - it put the freaking code okay right
03:32 - there so you have new folder dot one and
03:36 - the code is in there and now to run it I
03:38 - can just hit run and it runs it but
03:40 - again I want you to practice with
03:41 - command line so go over to your command
03:43 - line hit LS see where you are and here
03:47 - it shows me that I am in my if I do PWD
03:53 - it shows me that I'm in my workspace so
03:55 - let's just go to new folder whoops
04:02 - period one and that's there there it is
04:06 - my hello world so I just hit python
04:08 - hello world and run it okay so nothing
04:13 - is working
04:14 - you need Python three go here then you
04:18 - should be able to essentially even do
04:20 - something like if you had python so
04:22 - before i move further i just wanted to
04:24 - point out that when you go to sign up at
04:26 - c nine
04:27 - oh if I remember correctly they asked
04:29 - for your credit card but they don't
04:31 - actually charge you anything it's to
04:34 - make sure that you are who you say you
04:36 - are and probably I don't know oh and
04:41 - maybe it's easier for them to charge you
04:44 - once you kind of get to the point where
04:47 - you need more space in the start you
04:49 - don't need that much space you can just
04:51 - keep creating a new workspace every time
04:53 - you have to do something and most of the
04:54 - projects will be pretty lightweight but
04:56 - if you feel like you need more than a
04:58 - few gigabytes then you can you know pay
04:59 - them monthly and they'll give you some
05:02 - space but again it's free you just have
05:05 - to put your credit card number and in
05:07 - the start now if you do Python it'll
05:10 - take you to Python 2 and if you want to
05:12 - go to Python 3 then it's just as simple
05:14 - as Python and then type in 3 ok and
05:18 - that's it so I did it essentially right
05:21 - here at the bottom hopefully you can see
05:24 - it the screen is not too small and
05:26 - that's how you access Python to Python 3
05:30 - kind of everything works in C 9 dot IO
05:33 - so I love it and you really should love
05:36 - it too all right that's it for this
05:39 - video and I'll see you in the next video
05:50 - you
