00:00 - it's pretty much gone ahead and it's
00:01 - made everything black but it didn't do
00:03 - what we wanted and change
00:04 - the app.js h1
00:07 - so it should have made this actually
00:09 - should we
00:10 - should we just enable word wrap like
00:13 - because we do this really often
00:16 - yeah shall we because i think a lot that
00:18 - will help a lot of people actually yeah
00:20 - um okay so on so let's go back
00:24 - there so it i think word wrap is gonna
00:27 - be super because that's been i think a
00:28 - really frustrating thing even when i'm
00:30 - watching our own streams
00:31 - i get confused where everything is
00:35 - yeah so that should be good is there
00:36 - auto is there auto save or something
00:38 - along those lines we can enable in
00:40 - visual studio code
00:42 - oh good shower actually good shot uh
00:44 - let's go ahead and click settings
00:46 - let me double check let's do auto save
00:50 - something save auto save
00:53 - yeah so on focus change a dirty editor
00:56 - is automatically saved when the editor
00:58 - loses focus or
01:00 - we can do after a delay oh that's a
01:02 - dirty editor
01:03 - what the hell is a dirty editor i think
01:05 - that's when i switch
01:06 - to a different file it will save
01:09 - actually that's a good way of doing it
01:10 - yeah own focus change maybe but i mean
01:12 - you want it should be
01:14 - delay right or because it should be
01:17 - unfocused
01:18 - or which one should it be let's do after
01:21 - delay because then that way they can see
01:22 - the screen as it changes yeah let's do
01:24 - after today what do you have today i
01:25 - think perfect
01:26 - perfect that's really good so that might
01:29 - be one second
01:30 - yeah so if i one second delay that's
01:32 - pretty good so like
01:34 - let me test it so it says
01:38 - um okay
01:40 - reels
01:43 - nice that's perfect dude let's actually
01:46 - remove the building
01:49 - i'll do i'll remove the delay to half a
01:51 - second actually
01:53 - to dude that's pretty good actually try
01:55 - it that's like that's like real time
01:57 - coding i guess that's like
01:58 - real time yeah so let's do it yeah two
02:04 - do it 300 seconds yeah the only thing
02:07 - i'm wondering is
02:08 - say if i'm coding like a bunch like this
02:10 - oh
02:11 - that could be annoying oh no then again
02:13 - it's not doing it
02:14 - it's not doing it that's okay yeah we're
02:17 - good we're good
02:19 - okay he does it in a clever way should i
02:20 - do should i do it half second or less
02:22 - than half a second
02:25 - uh let's do it
02:28 - let's just give it let's give it a half
02:30 - second let's see let's see how half
02:32 - second goes
02:33 - okay cool done yeah that's pretty cool
02:36 - nice so that should help you guys out a
02:38 - bit more so you it should be a
02:40 - easier sort of smoother visual cue on
02:42 - you guys
02:43 - so now if we go back to this and we save
02:45 - oh no i don't need to save
02:46 - um so now
