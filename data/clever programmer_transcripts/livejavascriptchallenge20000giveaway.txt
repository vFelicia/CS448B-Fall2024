02:11 - video for you to watch that explains how
02:13 - everything works so it's gonna be
02:15 - extremely clear another thing that I get
02:22 - a lot from people is hey if I'm a
02:23 - beginner and I've never coded does this
02:26 - still work for me
02:28 - can I still join absolutely if you're a
02:30 - complete beginner you can still join and
02:33 - that's totally fine okay it's whether
02:36 - you're a beginner or advanced there's
02:38 - gonna be something there for every
02:39 - single person to learn so I think you're
02:41 - gonna really love it and if you're
02:43 - already in this Facebook group then
02:45 - amazing I'm so pumped to have you here
02:47 - and again if you start if you have any
02:49 - questions start writing them down and
02:51 - we'll start getting into it okay this is
02:53 - first of all wanted to test to make sure
02:56 - everything is working and running
02:57 - smoothly I know I me and my girlfriend
03:00 - and Nas was actually running the
03:02 - challenge we manually approved a lot of
03:06 - the people and we got over 1,000 member
03:10 - requests in less than a day so it's
03:12 - going to definitely definitely be the
03:15 - biggest challenge that we have done and
03:18 - I feel like a lot of people in the world
03:20 - for JavaScript have ever done especially
03:23 - when to giveaway it's gonna be massive
03:25 - and it's gonna start April 6 so the
03:28 - thousand people that we saw we declined
03:32 - a lot of the people probably declined
03:34 - six or seven hundred people just because
03:37 - they weren't the right fit so we are
03:39 - very selective about who we let into the
03:41 - group there's a list of questions we ask
03:44 - and we make sure that people answer them
03:46 - we make sure that the people who are
03:47 - entering are high quality people so the
03:51 - quality of the entire group
03:52 - is absolutely really really good right
03:55 - and so yeah we're looking for people
03:58 - really ambitious hungry trying to learn
04:00 - code but more importantly actually also
04:01 - trying to make an income from that skill
04:04 - so I'm gonna go to chat we got a lot of
04:07 - messages coming in I do know Java so
04:14 - okay ender says oh that's so cool I can
04:17 - show comments so easily ender says I do
04:20 - know JavaScript but I'm bad at it okay
04:23 - not a problem
04:24 - as long as
04:26 - you show up and you actually participate
04:28 - you can still win in the challenge also
04:31 - if you actually refer somebody who wins
04:34 - you win - so let's just say ender is
04:37 - like really bad at JavaScript right and
04:39 - he doesn't end up winning the challenge
04:41 - because he doesn't make the best project
04:43 - also he doesn't participate but let's
04:45 - say he referred his friend and if his
04:47 - friend wins then ender also wins the
04:51 - coding bootcamp or and her also wins the
04:53 - same prize that that person does so
04:56 - that's what if you refer people you can
04:58 - really really increase your chance and
05:00 - if you refer the right people you can
05:02 - really increase your chance of winning
05:04 - this challenge ok so again I know James
05:08 - also asked what if you don't know much
05:10 - ASO if you're a complete beginner that
05:12 - is totally fine it's not a big problem
05:15 - at all also how is the audio guys Kevin
05:21 - says whoever is going to join the
05:22 - challenge good luck and everyone do your
05:24 - best
05:25 - awesome Thank You Gavin for that I will
05:34 - says we need to learn to make a site
05:37 - like Facebook wash hands wash hands
05:40 - virtual hug yes because the corona virus
05:42 - we probably all need to do that actually
05:44 - a little bit Nicolas so I said if you're
05:50 - a complete beginner that's okay you can
05:52 - still join the five day challenge and
05:55 - you will still get a lot of value out of
05:58 - it and you can still participate in the

16:26 - definitely we're going to be going
16:27 - really heavy on the JavaScript portion
16:29 - of this this challenge thing no we are
16:32 - not going to be doing this often we've

23:12 - to know anything extensively before the
23:14 - challenge if you'll want to learn know
23:16 - it a little bit great but you don't
23:18 - really have to know anything above for
23:20 - hand
23:31 - javascript is not mandatory for back-end
23:34 - Java developer no I don't think so
23:44 - Seamus has also discovered
23:46 - experientially the sublime is very fast
23:48 - and quick in action even as a slow
23:49 - computer sublime hope is yes sublime is
23:51 - extremely fast sublime is sublime is
23:58 - awesome I like some wand plus it like
24:00 - when you write stuff it kind of writes
24:02 - in 60 frame rates per seconds it looks
24:04 - beautiful
24:05 - yeah I'm a fan of sublime but you know
24:08 - again with visuals to get code and how
24:09 - easy it is to like add vim integration
24:12 - in there and everything else them takes
24:14 - the cake for me Sherlock says I don't
24:23 - care about winning but I need the
