00:00 - so guys thank you so much for being a
00:02 - part of this five-day JavaScript
00:04 - developer challenge it was crazy we had
00:06 - over 10,000 people from every part of
00:08 - the world people participating from over
00:11 - 50 countries it was absolutely
00:13 - ridiculous it was phenomenally a tens of
00:15 - thousands of submissions we had 10,000
00:18 - plus members joined the group and
00:20 - participate in the challenge today right
00:22 - now I'm gonna be announcing all of the
00:24 - winners and that is so extremely
00:26 - exciting we had students go from all the
00:28 - way getting discounts in our courses all
00:30 - the way to students who want our six
00:32 - thousand dollar online coding boot camp
00:34 - and I'm gonna be announcing that in this
00:36 - video so let's go
00:49 - you
00:54 - now from places 10 through 4th they all

01:08 - bit like this
01:13 - so those are all from 10th to 4th places
01:15 - now what we do at clever programmer to
01:17 - figure out who won remember it to go
01:19 - through five thousand-plus submissions
01:20 - and so many challenges projects are
01:22 - submitted it was absolutely insane but
01:24 - to figure out who was the actual winner
01:26 - who deserves to win based on that we
01:29 - unanimously chose the winner within the
01:32 - clever programmer team so it Matt it
01:34 - depended on based on the homeworks that
01:36 - the submitted it depending on how they
01:38 - completed the project and really
01:40 - importantly it dependent on how they
01:41 - participated in the actual challenge in
01:46 - position number three we have a mother
