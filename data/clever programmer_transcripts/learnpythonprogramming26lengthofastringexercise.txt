00:00 - as what's up is Kazi from clever
00:01 - programmer calm where you learn to code
00:03 - smarter in this video what I want to
00:05 - talk about is string length function I
00:10 - don't know why I did that actually
00:13 - but essentially how this function works
00:17 - is that if I give you something I know
00:21 - it's going on land today if I give you
00:22 - something a string and you tell me how
00:25 - many characters are in there okay so by
00:28 - now hopefully you should kind of know
00:30 - the format of how these problems were
00:32 - laid out and how you can solve them and
00:34 - you can also look at the tests like the
00:37 - cert test that I have to kind of cheat
00:39 - right like oh this is aamani inputs it
00:41 - takes in and yadda yadda okay so try
00:45 - this problem on your own I have the
00:47 - notes below in the YouTube video I have
00:49 - the exercise solution below and if you
00:53 - want to you can go to my website clever
00:56 - programmer calm and enroll in the course
00:58 - so that it can keep track of everything
00:59 - and then you know it's all nice and all
01:03 - in one place anyways let's keep going
01:06 - so I'm going to write the solution right
01:08 - now so spoiler alert close your eyes
01:11 - kids if you haven't tried it do not look
01:14 - at this you don't deserve to look at the
01:16 - solution if you haven't tried it on your
01:17 - own already okay go try it on your own
01:20 - let's get let's get to the solution now
01:22 - so first thing I'm going to do is de F
01:25 - because it's a function then string
01:27 - length because that's what I told you
01:29 - the function name should be right right
01:31 - a function that takes in a string and
01:33 - returns its length right so
01:38 - the function is called string length
01:40 - right
01:42 - inputs how many inputs is the take that
01:44 - takes in a string so the word o should
01:49 - give you a hint that it's only one thing
01:51 - you can say string you can say my string
01:55 - you can call it whatever you want okay
01:56 - I'm just going to call it my string to
01:58 - let you guys know that there's no
01:59 - special meaning behind the word string
02:02 - itself so you don't need to like know
02:03 - what it does
02:05 - what this function requires you to know
02:08 - is how to do a for loop okay if you can
02:12 - do a for loop you can solve problem very
02:13 - easily so I have my string now what do I
02:17 - want to do I'm going to run through that
02:19 - string and count each letter right so if
02:23 - it's hello I want to count that I want
02:25 - to keep track of every letter that I see
02:27 - so when I see an H I go I hold my finger
02:31 - up like this like one when I see an e I
02:34 - go to when I see an L I go three I see
02:37 - another L I go for when I see an O I go
02:39 - five and if I'm wrong if I've run out of
02:43 - characters I want to just output five
02:46 - okay so it sounds like something that I
02:50 - want to run multiple times sounds like a
02:53 - loop four
02:55 - letter in
02:57 - my string right if I do print
03:02 - letter here
03:04 - you guys can see on the right hand side
03:07 - that is going to go through that and is
03:09 - going to print the letter I have to call
03:11 - the function of course
03:12 - string
03:14 - length and let's give it hello
03:17 - and let's run it and on the right hand
03:21 - side you can see that it goes h-e-l-l-o
03:26 - right that's great so we have access to
03:29 - each character now what do I want to do
03:31 - I want to have a tracker variable like
03:33 - count okay and I'm going to set it to
03:36 - zero and every time I see something I
03:38 - will not incremented by one so count is
03:40 - equal to count plus 1 or
03:44 - count plus equal one because such a
03:46 - common operation so we just increment by
03:48 - saying plus equals okay that's how
03:51 - you're going to see it written down in
03:52 - Python pretty much everywhere and if
03:54 - you're programming in some other
03:55 - language like C or C++ you're going to
03:57 - see it written like this
03:59 - all right so I have count equals count
04:04 - plus one so I'm incrementing count by
04:06 - one right increment count by one and
04:12 - how many times do I want to print out
04:14 - count every single time or just at the
04:16 - end if you think of that question in
04:18 - English you can answer that very easily
04:20 - I only wanted to return the count once
04:23 - so should it be part of the for loop or
04:25 - should it be outside for loop it should
04:28 - be outside of the for loop good okay and
04:31 - I just want to hit enter so it looks
04:32 - nice and
04:35 - and yeah now let's try this let's do
04:38 - print and my function right let's see if
04:42 - it prints five okay it prints hello and
04:44 - then it prints out five we don't want to
04:47 - print out hello anymore because we know
04:49 - it works just fine and you get five how
04:53 - does it work if you really break it down
04:54 - well to my function I pass hello right
04:58 - so this part of my string becomes hello
05:02 - then this becomes hello the first time
05:06 - we're going through the loop this is an
05:09 - H right
05:11 - then we just count it by one then the
05:14 - next time we go through the loop this is
05:16 - just an E and then we count it by one
05:20 - then next time we go through the loop
05:21 - this is an L then we increment by one
05:24 - next time we go through the loop it's
05:26 - elegant and we increment count by one
05:29 - and then last time weren't o we
05:31 - increment count by one now count is five
05:34 - and then we return five now if you
05:38 - notice do we do we use the variable
05:41 - letter anywhere else no we don't really
05:44 - use it so you can say whatever you want
05:45 - here or you can just put an underscore
05:48 - here because we don't really use it
05:50 - anywhere so we don't care what that
05:52 - variable is but sure we'll just we'll
05:55 - just leave it as letter at the end of
05:57 - the day I wanted to return count now
05:59 - let's test our function if it prints out
06:01 - your code is correct then our code is
06:03 - indeed correct and we are done let's
06:06 - check it out hopes I can't hard code a
06:09 - value here I have to change this to
06:13 - my string and
06:16 - let's run it and it says your code is
06:18 - correct
06:19 - now guys we're learning all of this to
06:24 - build something big okay we're going to
06:26 - build our own rock-paper-scissors and I
06:28 - don't mean like code Academy calm let me
06:31 - hold your hand and here's the entire
06:33 - code and you feel like you dated but you
06:36 - didn't really learn anything I mean
06:37 - you're going to be doing practically the
06:39 - whole thing I'm going to you the
06:40 - barebone pieces but you're going to be
06:42 - writing your own code and I really want
06:45 - you to be able to do this completely on
06:46 - your own so it's really important that
06:48 - you do all of these exercises and try
06:51 - your best to do them on your own because
06:54 - you will need all of these pieces to
06:57 - then go and try to build your own game
07:00 - so we're going to start off with a
07:01 - simple game like rock-paper-scissors but
07:03 - then after that we're going to do
07:05 - something with Twilio API which is the
07:07 - text messaging at you can build pretty
07:09 - much your own text messaging app okay
07:11 - and you can actually send people text
07:14 - messages on their phones so we're going
07:17 - to be doing some really big stuff here
07:18 - all right no more baby stuff
07:21 - but I want you to be prepared for that
07:23 - that's why I have this for you guys I
07:25 - have notes that solution notes and
07:28 - everything so take advantage of that use
07:31 - everything at your disposal
07:33 - if you haven't already subscribed to
07:37 - this channel and do not miss the next
07:39 - video because in those all of those
07:41 - videos that are coming up we're going to
07:43 - be covering covering really important
07:45 - things I'll see you there
