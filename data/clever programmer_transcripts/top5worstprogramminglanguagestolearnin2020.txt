00:00 - what's up guys this is Kazi here from
00:02 - clever programmer comm today we're doing
00:04 - something very very fascinating first of
00:06 - all we're gonna be talking about the top
00:07 - 5 worst programming languages in 2020 so
00:12 - that's gonna be really exciting when
00:13 - we're talking about all kinds of crazy
00:15 - programming languages from brain fog to
00:17 - whitespace to wall code to Trump scripts
00:19 - to whatever else and we're doing
00:22 - something really fascinating which is
00:24 - that we are in a podcast studio and we
00:26 - have a team of four people today Before

00:57 - comm and sign up for free with that said
01:00 - let's jump right into this podcast so
01:03 - you guys probably know Aaron we got
01:07 - Frankie in the house yo and we go knows
01:11 - hello hello how's it going everybody
01:17 - dumansky
01:18 - yes nas is a special guest here from
01:21 - Detroit Michigan he's a developer he's a
01:23 - django developer he's a badass
01:25 - freelancer and so we're gonna be
01:28 - learning a lot of things and we
01:29 - shouldn't be kicking back relaxing and
01:30 - having a lot of fun so welcome thank you
01:33 - thank you for having me I appreciate it
01:34 - this is awesome a young cat 2:24 what's
01:38 - up successful freelance for 24 huh well
01:40 - yeah still learning a lot still learning
01:45 - a lot so nas talk to me how you got into
01:52 - freelancing a little bit you know just
01:54 - so people can get a little bit of
01:55 - context like just talk about how you got
01:57 - into freelancing yeah and of what you've
02:00 - accomplished so far with it just a
02:02 - little bit of a recap so people know
02:03 - yeah so something I've been developing
02:05 - for about seven years now right so
02:07 - started back in high school that kind of
02:09 - worked the work that startups work the
02:12 - corporations
02:13 - and for the past for the past like you
02:17 - know two years I've worked at a startup
02:18 - called kind of service calm and yeah and
02:22 - and seven months ago like I decided to
02:25 - quit I decided to quit because I want to
02:27 - try something else and with the chest
02:28 - something different and I wasn't really
02:30 - really excited about where where I was
02:33 - going so and all of a sudden I was like
02:35 - you know what this is something I need
02:37 - to try this is something need to do as I
02:40 - just decided to quit and there we go
02:42 - here we are right now for the past seven
02:45 - months it has been an interesting
02:46 - journey had to learn a lot of things and
02:49 - it was definitely difficult and it still
02:51 - it still really is difficult but but you
02:55 - know it's amazing to have the freedom
02:56 - that you get from something like this
02:59 - and to learn so much because now not
03:01 - only you are as are you a developer but
03:05 - you are kind of a businessperson right
03:07 - your sales guy your your manager right
03:09 - you're thinking about so many different
03:11 - things and itself that that is the
03:15 - interesting part too right yeah you got
03:17 - to do a little bit of everything and
03:19 - especially when you're doing because you
03:21 - said you started working in startups
03:22 - yeah you kind of got to do a little bit
03:24 - of everything in a start-up you're
03:27 - wearing lots of different hats I mean
03:28 - just like ask these guys you know
03:31 - Frankie and Aaron I mean how many hats
03:33 - do you guys have to wear working in a
03:36 - working in a start-up he wears a lot you
03:45 - get to touch a lot of different um a lot
03:48 - of different topics really like I
03:50 - started off as a video editor and stuff
03:51 - now we do a bunch of I don't know philia
03:54 - marketing things and we all kind of get
03:57 - to know what each other is doing so you
03:59 - know you kind of jump into other fields
04:00 - and stuff and it's cool because you kind
04:03 - of get to know what else you're made of
04:05 - you know not just like like what I see
04:07 - in nas is like this guy's like super
04:09 - into development but I also see him just
04:11 - ease when like I see a lot of developers
04:13 - and a lot of times these guys I don't
04:15 - wanna you know generalize but a lot of
04:17 - times developers are a little bit more
04:19 - low-energy asked to say and there have a
04:23 - little bit of trouble expressing
04:23 - themselves and I see Naz talking about
04:25 - something like SEO which is not even
04:27 - like completely related to development
04:28 - or at all but he's just [ __ ] passion
04:31 - kinase where you passionate and stuff
04:33 - and it's it's contagious you know and
04:35 - it's a [ __ ] swear on this podcast
04:37 - okay yeah but those qualities I feel are
04:40 - great for like freelancing and stuff and
04:42 - those qualities are also great for small
04:44 - companies you know yeah I think well
04:46 - communication I think one of the things
04:47 - you mentioned communication being able
04:49 - to communicate properly is one of the
04:51 - biggest qualities in itself and a
04:53 - developer how can anybody else right
04:55 - especially as a developer a
04:57 - communication quality being able to
04:58 - communicate between the developers the
05:01 - business people right right
05:02 - that is a very big quality that a lot is
05:05 - underrated right but with it with it you
05:09 - can go very far so far right like
05:13 - communication is very important the octa
05:15 - MIMO communication well I probably the
05:19 - worst communication yeah I communicate
05:20 - about it I mean it's important you have
05:24 - to be on a team like that this is
05:25 - actually the first real like legit team
05:27 - I've been on besides like you know
05:28 - soccer teams and stupid school projects
05:31 - that don't really count like I never
05:32 - actually had that you got a
05:34 - communicating little blow with everybody
05:35 - but even with like communicating with
05:37 - like other people like you guys how many
05:38 - hats you go where I think we all wear
05:39 - every hat like at some point yeah we're
05:41 - all learning everything yeah some of us
05:43 - are better than others but yeah
05:45 - communication is so important like
05:46 - that's why I got on the team in the
05:48 - first place I found you guys just
05:49 - communication right it's important yeah
05:52 - like when it comes to for example for
05:54 - developers to land a job you can't take
05:56 - me you gotta reach out that's one
05:59 - communication and you gotta be able to
06:00 - actually land the contract and then keep
06:03 - the client that requires communication
06:05 - and most people either they can't get a
06:08 - client lack of communication in that
06:10 - place and then they can't keep a client
06:14 - a lot of the times and most of the time
06:16 - that happens because they've either lost
06:17 - the trust or didn't follow up or
06:20 - whatever the case may be
06:22 - yeah and also this is how deals happen
06:25 - we were watching this crazy ass show of
06:27 - recently men who built America
06:29 - [ __ ] awesome show amazing it's such
06:31 - an amazing show and in
06:33 - they're talking about Vanderbilt and
06:36 - Rockefeller who built you know according
06:38 - to today it would he would be worth what
06:40 - two hundred twenty five billion dollars
06:41 - at the time this guy communicated with
06:44 - Vanderbilt and he wasn't scared and he
06:47 - could withstand the pressure and he was
06:48 - in that moment he made the deal this
06:52 - happens a lot of times with developers
06:53 - way where they're afraid to negotiate
06:56 - for what they want
06:57 - yeah they are afraid to withstand the
07:00 - pressure they could be working for a
07:01 - company for like ten twenty years but
07:03 - they're they're pretty afraid to go up
07:06 - to their boss and be like hey can I make
07:09 - like ten dollars more man per hour it's
07:11 - actually it's great thing you mentioned
07:13 - that right because you know being able
07:15 - to kind of stand up for yourself and to
07:17 - communicate that so you know I've worked
07:19 - with different people and and there's a
07:23 - difference between you can have a
07:24 - developer who was just as good as
07:26 - another developer right but if that one
07:28 - developer is able to go out there and is
07:31 - not afraid to kind of put himself out
07:33 - there and you know go to the CEO and ask
07:35 - for my money for example right he will
07:38 - actually be he will actually be able to
07:40 - go much further and someone who's just
07:42 - kind of scared and it's still at the
07:44 - same level like you know still the same
07:46 - level knowledge wise and experience wise
07:49 - the guy who was able to ask and to
07:51 - demand right will be able to go much
07:53 - further much further yeah okay with that
07:56 - let's get into the languages okay so
08:00 - let's let's start with this so this but
08:02 - this was a lot of good stuff that we're
08:03 - talking about we continue to talk about
08:05 - this type of fascinating stuff but let's
08:07 - give people what they really came for
08:09 - all right so top five worst programming
08:12 - languages number five
08:15 - drum bro which one is it you said we're
08:19 - starting with Lou alright that's pretty
08:21 - good yeah I don't even know what it is
08:23 - alright so I just heard it was bet yeah
08:28 - it's a bad language man it's it's a high
08:30 - level programming language mm-hmm right
08:33 - Lua is a powerful and fast programming
08:36 - language that is easy to learn use and
08:38 - embed in your application all right good
08:40 - marketing yeah design in 1993 as a
08:44 - language for extending software
08:46 - applications to me
08:47 - demand of customization at the time oh
08:49 - they got cuz they had customizations at
08:51 - the time there that's possible dang
08:55 - focus of approving speed and probability
08:58 - and accessibility
09:00 - the only time I've actually heard about
09:02 - Lua is the only experience I have had
09:05 - with it is running a video game server I
09:08 - don't know if people know this game but
09:10 - it's a really popular game in Europe
09:13 - it's called tibia
09:13 - it's a mmm mmm Oh RPG and these guys are
09:17 - it's like a 2d universe or world or
09:19 - whatever and it's funny because I mean
09:21 - just graphically it's not that hard to
09:23 - recreate the game or whatever but the
09:25 - way that you would change like the
09:26 - values of like items like let's say
09:28 - armor is 15 or 14 or whatever and I hope
09:31 - I'm not like geeking out too much but
09:32 - like you can not everybody who's a
09:34 - program yeah exactly so you would go
09:37 - into the Lua files and I would actually
09:39 - change the scripts on just notepad I
09:41 - would open them up on notepad and change
09:43 - the scripts there change the values from
09:45 - like Armour 15 to 17 and then it would
09:48 - change that inside the game you [ __ ]
09:49 - cheater
09:50 - yeah it was my universe it was my server
09:52 - so people would play under my rules so I
09:54 - would choose what type of you know what
09:56 - type of oh that's awesome yeah and and
09:57 - that's how I actually got to know Lua I
09:59 - didn't even know was a language I
10:01 - thought it was a phone extension by the
10:02 - way guys everybody's a developer here
10:04 - yeah but go ahead but yeah that's that's
10:06 - pretty much what I know about it and I
10:09 - honestly I knew nothing about code I
10:11 - didn't even know it was coding but it's
10:13 - actually pretty easy for beginners to
10:16 - get to read lure and kind of understand
10:18 - it you know yeah it was like 14 at the
10:20 - time oh so you're saying you had your
10:23 - own servers is how you're using force
10:24 - yeah I had my own video game server
10:25 - running on it was a it's called a server
10:30 - list or whatever and people would like
10:32 - just from all over the world would go
10:33 - into the server and I the most the peak
10:36 - people that had the most people that had
10:38 - at one specific time was like ninety
10:40 - people live Wow no wonder is great it's
10:44 - creative for accessibility yeah yeah
10:46 - yeah you know like don't starve together
10:49 - this one is this game that I absolutely
10:51 - love on Steam
10:53 - play it like crazy or used to play like
10:55 - crazy dad I think is also built in Lua
10:57 - but even with that said it has a very
11:00 - stack like it's
11:01 - it's dropping down because now there are
11:03 - other programming languages that people
11:04 - are using you know like for example
11:07 - using Unity game engine and that's what
11:09 - we've got C++ C sharp C sharp C sure
11:12 - it's one of those but that's what people
11:14 - are using and they're not using Lua that
11:18 - much anymore so that's been that's been
11:21 - pretty much on the decline yeah can we
11:25 - look up on Google Trends wait what it's
11:28 - saying about Lua and so while you're
11:32 - doing that I'm actually looking at
11:33 - syntax and it's really interesting
11:35 - because it literally looks like Python
11:39 - it's got you know you got your prints it
11:41 - print hello world you know with the
11:43 - parentheses looks like actually Python 3
11:45 - so they thought ahead of the curve
11:47 - Python 3 just got the whole print
11:49 - parentheses hello world you know oh yeah
11:53 - and it's got functions and and you know
11:55 - for variable for variable you say you
11:56 - have something like local x equals 1
11:59 - you got your loops dang this is awesome
12:02 - yeah they got quite a lot if you
12:05 - actually if you go to like transit
12:07 - google.com right and you just if you go
12:11 - there and you can look at it and the
12:14 - growth of Python I mean obviously that's
12:19 - much more cuz that's the number one
12:20 - language especially right now too but
12:23 - when you look at Lua
12:24 - it had this little jump around right
12:28 - around 2009 it had that little spike but
12:32 - then after that it just started
12:34 - declining like crazy and I kid you not
12:37 - that's the time where I was playing with
12:38 - the server seriously I was eighth ninth
12:41 - grade yeah damn me so all that yeah
12:49 - there it is there it is there you go
12:51 - so whoa you can look at the trend line
12:54 - there and then if you if you click on
12:56 - the compare where it's like the plus
12:58 - sign compare right next to Lua yeah and
13:03 - you can type in Python there and then
13:05 - it'll allow you to see Lua compared with
13:08 - the Python
13:10 - and that will give you certain
13:13 - interestingly enough I'm looking at the
13:15 - sub-region right
13:16 - you've got Lula being used guess what is
13:18 - the number one region it's being used in
13:21 - or you know uh Lua well Oh Hawaii here's
13:25 - okay but now you really see that Lua you
13:28 - know it maybe have tiny little spike
13:31 - some points but it's pretty much been
13:34 - very low interest throughout like all
13:36 - the way through yeah yeah I'm the thing
13:38 - that's being used much and I mean ever
13:40 - right so they say there's a huge much
13:43 - more demand many more developers that
13:45 - know it then the demand for the jobs so
13:48 - that's why I would put this in top five
13:50 - worst programming languages because I
13:52 - think it's um yeah it's not that great
13:55 - so like probably avoid it if you can
13:58 - yeah yeah if you want to script just use
14:00 - Python that's right I'm still widget I'm
14:03 - still that still amazes me that still it
14:05 - looks pretty good in terms of syntax
14:06 - wise that's still the amazing part to me
14:09 - honestly it looks good syntax well like
14:11 - you know being developed in 1993 is is
14:13 - it functional or is it this obvious is
14:17 - functional because it's not a function
14:18 - no because well because you got your
14:21 - while you got your you got your you got
14:24 - your loops you got your okay its primary
14:27 - okay so Lua it's a lightweight
14:29 - high-level multi-paradigm programming
14:30 - language and it's designed for embedded
14:33 - use and applications
14:36 - I've curious what kind of locations now
14:40 - okay what
14:46 - oh yeah there we go that's another one
14:47 - yeah what did you get stuff can you
14:48 - build with Lua let's take a look at that
14:50 - oh yo you know roblox that we saw at
14:52 - VidCon that those people are talking
14:54 - about roblox game that's to keep you out
14:55 - of code that's based on Loula
14:57 - are you serious yeah pretty sure hold on
15:00 - so I'm looking at I'm looking right now
15:02 - at things that use Lua so video games is
15:05 - one other uses you got Adobe Photoshop
15:11 - Lightroom Apache HTTP server so yeah I'm
15:16 - looking at on Wikipedia other videos you
15:19 - have to be very careful where a spike
15:22 - database that's right oh yeah it's
15:24 - popping up that's awesome yeah awesome
15:26 - to have a TV you've got a Photoshop I
15:31 - was that's surprising right cheat engine
15:34 - Cisco yeah I was like whoa you're crying
15:39 - CryEngine yeah conky system monitoring
15:46 - that yeah I don't know what a lot of
15:47 - this damn small Linux you know Redis
15:50 - database dolphin computer no you know
15:53 - Redis like read Tuesday right yes yeah
15:55 - yeah yeah Redis is an open source
15:57 - database in which Lua can be used okay
16:00 - can be used in there interesting
16:02 - interesting
16:04 - okay so anyways if if you can avoid it
16:10 - avoid it unless there's a very specific
16:14 - use case that you're learning it for and
16:16 - the job you're trying to apply for like
16:18 - you're trying to work for some you know
16:20 - Adobe Photoshop it's very nice and you
16:24 - want so like yeah don't put effort into
16:26 - it unless it's very clear that you're
16:28 - gonna get a return right yeah I think
16:31 - it's using much anymore honestly okay
16:34 - let's move to top four worst horrible
16:39 - programming languages what do we got -
16:42 - four top four you know what I want to do
16:44 - a thing let's define what do you mean by
16:46 - worst by worst okay so that's a great
16:48 - thing so when what we're saying worst we
16:51 - were we gave it a lot of thought were
16:53 - thinking should we just put really
16:56 - garbage as a
16:57 - tarek programming languages and while we
16:59 - still plan to do that we wanted to put
17:01 - some programming languages that are just
17:03 - facing a sharp decline that way people
17:05 - can still resonate with it you know so
17:07 - if you're watching this video we want
17:09 - the people to go okay that I know about
17:11 - Lou or I know about this you know of
17:13 - course there's like worse programming
17:14 - languages than Lua like way worse that
17:16 - nobody is actually using but I feel like
17:19 - at certain times you get so esoteric
17:20 - that it's it's not that fun anymore you
17:22 - know so so it's a mixture of programming
17:26 - like declining and then few we're gonna
17:29 - kind of just throw out here for
17:30 - entertainment so people can can be you
17:33 - know yeah I'm crazy cuz there's so
17:36 - there's some really crazy ones out there
17:37 - yeah but that's what I mean by worse so
17:39 - that's what I'm I gotcha I gotcha I
17:40 - gotcha what would you say in terms of in
17:42 - terms that fine yeah yeah that's perfect
17:44 - that's perfect it's a number four worst
17:46 - programming language or Lang dump them
17:53 - down what do you got there no darling I
17:56 - don't know I'm reading the Kapiti right
17:58 - now let me see it is a general-purpose
18:01 - programming language and running
18:03 - environment oh that's a great
18:04 - explanation okay so this is a concurrent
18:07 - functional programming language um right
18:09 - off the bat one thing they kind of know
18:11 - it's like probably go is gonna be more
18:13 - popular right because go is a concurrent
18:15 - language and I believe go is is it also
18:17 - functional I don't believe so go is not
18:21 - functional yeah yeah too many but like
18:26 - Erlang is the main one we're looking at
18:34 - functional yeah okay so you have so go
18:38 - so if go as functional right and gore
18:40 - general purpose and if go as concurrent
18:42 - and it's super popular then this is
18:45 - probably gonna die off even more but
18:48 - let's look at like what kind of led to
18:50 - its decline
18:56 - Wow Ericsson is that like the company
19:00 - Ericsson you know like Sony Ericsson oh
19:03 - man there's like bunch of stuff that's
19:05 - pretty yeah it is it actually is the
19:07 - company Ericsson what do you mean like
19:11 - Sony Ericsson the ones who developed it
19:13 - yeah okay
19:15 - so few reason why Erlang is really bad
19:18 - right according to I'm reading a blog
19:20 - post by code mentor dot IO and the one
19:23 - of the reasons why they say it's really
19:25 - bad this is this is really nice graphic
19:28 - actually is it possible to put it pull
19:31 - that one up I think you would just type
19:35 - in code mentored i/o and then worst
19:38 - languages to learn and this brings up
19:41 - something pretty interesting mm-hmm
19:42 - so they go they talk about the worst
19:45 - programming and just learn 2018 but it's
19:47 - I think this applies for 2019 and most
19:50 - likely for 2022 and they have they've
19:54 - split it between community engagement
19:56 - job market and growth and trends and
19:59 - their community engagement is for Erlang
20:04 - is pretty bad they pretty low their job
20:08 - market for Erlang is actually very low
20:11 - as well so they're not a lot of job
20:12 - opportunities that exists so when it
20:15 - comes to like bad programming languages
20:17 - that you want to avoid you probably want
20:18 - to avoid languages that have lured low
20:24 - demand you know people paying less and
20:26 - then the growth and trend of Erlang is
20:29 - also dying too but what are you guys
20:31 - thoughts on it so I'm looking right now
20:35 - I looked at what companies used Erlang
20:38 - right and I'm gonna name a few so we've
20:41 - got name a few that my name a few that
20:44 - are pretty much known facebook facebook
20:47 - chat back and it still uses it looks
20:50 - like looks like it either uses it or
20:53 - used it I thought that I thought they
20:55 - used you should be PHP man I don't know
20:59 - I mean according I'm looking directly on
21:02 - Ireland org so you know their actual
21:05 - website and looks like pee so it's
21:07 - Facebook back-end they've also got watts
21:10 - messaging for smartphones they've got
21:12 - the whatsapp app as well hmm
21:15 - we've got a few ones that one app is
21:17 - written in early according to them which
21:22 - is weird
21:24 - probably features of it yeah holy moly
21:30 - well what's out five best thing is it's
21:37 - used for in the communication systems
21:39 - right you know you know and all these
21:41 - all these programs you know Facebook and
21:44 - whatsapp they're all telecommunications
21:46 - almost it's almost dinner look at that
21:50 - Wow as it was suitable for accommodating
21:52 - huge communication system with high
21:54 - sustainability there's a famous
21:57 - open-source jabber server written in
22:01 - Erlang over systems that do the backend
22:04 - message routing are done in Erlang God
22:07 - you didn't know that dude I am pretty
22:12 - blown away so maybe it's not the worst
22:18 - for programming languages just remove
22:23 - the worst part out okay so yeah there
22:32 - you go awful don't [ __ ] learn this so
22:34 - if you want to get a job at whatsapp
22:36 - learn early how many devs do they need
22:40 - for an app like that I mean actually
22:42 - usually the teams are fairly small right
22:43 - yeah I mean what like whatsapp or
22:46 - Facebook well I mean Facebook you know a
22:47 - lot but like what is what's up wonder
22:49 - Facebook it's not well no Facebook
22:50 - bought whatsapp did they yeah
22:53 - didn't know that yeah what's funny it's
22:54 - one of the workers from Facebook
22:56 - actually founded wet tops it's funny
22:58 - that like Facebook uses Erlang and then
22:59 - this guy in whatsapp uses Arlington yeah
23:02 - and he's like the guy election found
23:03 - face of what's up I think is actually
23:05 - Ukrainian - oh he actually didn't work
23:07 - for Facebook he wasn't he actually
23:09 - didn't pass the interview for face yeah
23:12 - yeah yeah yeah I remember that
23:13 - yeah yeah that's true that is true oh my
23:16 - gosh and then yeah and then they how
23:18 - much they end up buying what's up for
23:19 - was it 60 60 billion dollars I forgot
23:22 - 16:06 maybe that's it
23:24 - six billion I don't know check it out oh
23:30 - right there yeah well the what's that
23:34 - founders they they set the prices
23:36 - sixteen billion mmm-hmm but hey okay
23:41 - they paid twenty one okay so here are a
23:45 - few hypotheses for why this is pretty
23:49 - fascinating this is some article suppose
23:53 - somebody made on Y Combinator hacker
23:55 - news and it's like okay why isn't it
23:57 - popular and the guy says you know they
24:02 - go people say or Lang is being used for
24:06 - whatsapp and then people ask the
24:08 - question right after that they go why
24:09 - isn't it popular anymore that's kind of
24:11 - exactly what we're thinking right now
24:12 - it's like why isn't it popular anymore
24:14 - well they say that don't look at the
24:18 - language itself to get insight into why
24:20 - it's not popular look into the community
24:22 - for why it's not popular right make
24:24 - sense that's one big reason and then
24:26 - they gave like multiple other reasons
24:28 - like for example they don't have a
24:29 - package manager there are no open source
24:34 - packages there's no committees like
24:36 - everything has the open source package
24:38 - github is like a goldmine for JavaScript
24:41 - frameworks or whatever right they don't
24:42 - have open source packages they have no
24:46 - community site there are guns - no for
24:50 - loops wait what well you know listen
24:55 - yeah lists for Strings variables don't
24:58 - vary there are no docks or too many
25:02 - docks that are incorrect they're not
25:06 - enough teaching materials so it's just a
25:08 - regular language like a spoken language
25:09 - like what is this no documentation
25:13 - emacs's ID but that's crazy though like
25:21 - I mean if you don't like a potato well
25:23 - that's you know I mean the big part is
25:25 - you're right if you don't have a
25:26 - community around it then that's why it's
25:29 - a dying you know that's a very big part
25:30 - of a dying language the community as
25:33 - well makes anything really popular
25:35 - that's why Python is so big
25:37 - yeah cuz I mean like if it's a if it's a
25:39 - programming language then it can
25:40 - obviously create you can obviously
25:42 - create something with it so like it's
25:43 - not because it's like it's
25:44 - non-functional but like yeah energy use
25:46 - and and yeah so exactly so this is very
25:48 - fascinating I think we can learn a lot
25:51 - from just this I think it's just really
25:52 - interesting because a lot it's a lot
25:55 - about adoption of a language - it's not
25:57 - just how great it is or how great the
25:59 - features are a lot about the adoption
26:01 - cuz functionality-wise is incredible but
26:05 - some other things that people are
26:06 - hypothesis hypothesizing or like the
26:08 - syntax is weird not only in a paradigm
26:11 - way but the pattern matching to most
26:13 - other programming languages it doesn't
26:16 - match the pattern of how you write most
26:18 - of the programming languages which make
26:20 - looks wack the syntax looks really weird
26:22 - like I can't even there I can't even
26:23 - decipher it like what the heck is this
26:25 - by the way this is hot Thanks yeah
26:38 - syntax go ahead now go ahead you go
26:40 - ahead at your first so the syntax is
26:42 - really odd and it makes it so people
26:46 - can't just jump in the barrier of entry
26:49 - is very very high even for us I'm like
26:52 - I'm looking at I'm like what can I see
26:54 - some I mean looks like a receiving it
27:04 - receives the signal yeah you could just
27:05 - type in like Erlang syntax or something
27:08 - on him and then go to images and maybe
27:09 - something will come up and I feel like
27:12 - it's a very low level low level it's low
27:14 - level programming language okay so yes
27:17 - it's also a little bit low level I guess
27:21 - but I think the adoptability is the main
27:24 - main thing yeah I'm surprised of what's
27:28 - for what's that using it home yeah well
27:30 - like look at the some of the syntax
27:31 - right it's weird it's like word count
27:35 - well well I mean it it is not tearing
27:39 - yeah look I love it's like halfway
27:41 - between like Java bytecode or like
27:44 - assembly and a high level it's like
27:46 - halfway between because there's weird
27:47 - jump statements and stuff yes jump
27:50 - statements one
27:51 - like it says like to go back to the top
27:53 - of a loop you can link loop back up with
27:55 - him let's let's guess let's guess what's
27:58 - going on in there well I mean I guess it
28:00 - just by looking at the function name in
28:01 - one I know what's going on they are
28:04 - doing they're updating word count I
28:10 - don't know dude look you got a table is
28:15 - that like an empty array line 29 looking
28:18 - up a word I don't know what so what okay
28:22 - who is up for learning this language for
28:25 - 24 hours and then we make a video on it
28:27 - do that's interesting people vote on
28:30 - that idea then yeah you should actually
28:33 - choose all five okay choose one of the
28:35 - five and we'll do yeah just one of them
28:36 - front verse five and then the one that
28:38 - gets the most up votes yeah we'll spend
28:40 - 24 hours learning it doesn't be above
28:42 - like 20 or 30 up vote and well maybe
28:44 - this will make the next Facebook but the
28:47 - order what's that I was getting yeah out
28:49 - of void space so as you unconvincingly
28:54 - saw it's a bad language don't learn it
29:00 - unless you want to work for horribly
29:04 - awesome companies like whatsapp yeah
29:06 - yeah no she's actually Facebook again
29:09 - the main thing is the adaptability of it
29:11 - is low which makes it so the future and
29:14 - the trend of it is not as high so of
29:17 - course there's some specialized
29:18 - companies you could work for whatsapp
29:20 - and probably some others but you if you
29:22 - want to look at the longevity of it it's
29:25 - not gonna be that high and because it's
29:26 - the here's here's why you'd rather learn
29:29 - Lua over this is because Luis still
29:32 - probably like most other languages so
29:34 - when you learn it you can still pick up
29:36 - lots of other languages this I feel like
29:38 - will leave you in a place where it
29:41 - doesn't really apply to many other
29:43 - things you only learn this like if
29:45 - you're doing something very specific
29:46 - like don't start with this this is this
29:48 - would correct it's not something yeah
29:50 - because for example if you pick up
29:52 - JavaScript as your first programming
29:53 - language or Python or Java well you
29:56 - could still pick up all the other
29:57 - languages pretty easily but if you pick
30:00 - up like machine code is your first
30:03 - language that's not gonna really
30:04 - translate
30:04 - to any other language but you know the
30:07 - interesting part is like a lot of these
30:09 - languages they're really not used a lot
30:12 - they actually pay a lot of money like in
30:15 - terms of work like work wise because not
30:18 - a lot of people there may be a little
30:20 - demand for them right but there's also
30:22 - very little supply I have I had back in
30:25 - college I had as a friend of mine and he
30:29 - told me about how you know for example
30:31 - think Ford or GM they're looking for
30:33 - COBOL COBOL
30:34 - yeah like COBOL engineers and they were
30:36 - ready to pay like 200k or something just
30:39 - for a COBOL engineer you know right and
30:41 - that's because there aren't a lot of a
30:42 - lot of them good but doesn't say that
30:44 - doesn't you know right I'm not saying
30:46 - like go you need to learn it I'm just
30:47 - this is just an interesting perspective
30:48 - right so it's kind of like how clothes
30:52 - they're in fashion then they go out of
30:54 - fashion and then they're so old that
30:56 - they come back in fashion again yeah I
30:59 - mean if you want to play that gamble
31:01 - that's fine but I feel like most of the
31:04 - times is that it's like a gamble so yeah
31:08 - I imagine there's give me some educates
31:10 - people who will benefit off of it but I
31:12 - feel like majority of the people
31:13 - probably not benefit out of it I'm
31:16 - looking monster 77 Jobs found from early
31:19 - all right let's move to the third
31:22 - today's which one should we go it should
31:25 - we go with trump script yeah let's just
31:27 - stick to letting do the order will be
31:28 - picked earlier
31:29 - all right sweet let's go number two top
31:32 - third worst programming language Trump
31:35 - script alright so this language how do
31:39 - you have to end the script you have to
31:40 - end it with like make America great
31:42 - again right that's how you officially
31:44 - end uh
31:44 - may you know I'm looking at this
31:46 - Christian make Python great yeah make
31:47 - Python great again I think that's how
31:49 - you end every it's written in Python
31:53 - yeah which is awesome it's literally
31:57 - just part-time I use you just have to
31:59 - end the script with that I'm trying to
32:01 - find something on it oh that's so
32:05 - interesting is it just literally Python
32:09 - yeah there you go
32:11 - oh I think let's do the second I think
32:16 - we let's go with the Virg
32:18 - one second one no not that I think
32:21 - there's another one by the verge there
32:23 - let's click on that the Donald Trump
32:27 - programming language is not for dummies
32:29 - or losers love the headline main coding
32:38 - nice tagline okay so there's a part
32:41 - where it goes
32:44 - it goes like for example if you use a
32:46 - word that's been banned the error
32:48 - message will read we're all have to
32:50 - scroll down a little bit there yeah it's
32:51 - like that like whole section with the
32:54 - error message will read Trump doesn't
32:57 - want to hear it or if you use a word
33:01 - that's not common it will say we have a
33:04 - country where it is similar you have to
33:06 - speak there's some more features of
33:12 - Trump scripts so for example no
33:13 - floating-point numbers only integers
33:15 - because America thank you yeah so the
33:19 - idea behind not having any floating
33:21 - numbers and only integers is because
33:22 - America never does anything halfway all
33:26 - numbers must be strictly greater than 1
33:28 - million the small stuff is in constant
33:32 - and there are no important code has to
33:44 - be homegrown and american-made and in
33:48 - its raw form
33:49 - Trump's crit is not compatible with
33:51 - windows because isn't the guy isn't the
33:54 - type of guy to believe in PC yeah so if
34:08 - you sorry just one more time if we sell
34:12 - just a little bit down you'll have the
34:13 - first working Trump script so save roses
34:20 - are red say violets are blue if lies say
34:24 - if I can beat Hillary says so can you
34:27 - what and then you gotta end it with
34:31 - America's great so this is Trump dot txt
34:34 - Wow
34:36 - this guy even wrote this for us on
34:38 - github Wow now I'm actually gonna go to
34:41 - their Trump probably paid to develop
34:43 - this language you know you know when it
34:45 - came out I was gonna make a video on it
34:47 - right when it came out why didn't it
34:49 - come out by the way they know a few
34:51 - years ago because running it says
35:00 - features error messages are mostly
35:02 - quotes directly taken from Trump himself
35:07 - only the most say only the most popular
35:12 - English words Trump's favorite words and
35:14 - current politician names can be used as
35:16 - variable names the other one is like
35:21 - said if the running computer is from
35:23 - China Donald Trump's curb will not
35:24 - compile are you serious dude somebody
35:29 - went really far with this like it
35:33 - probably checks for IP addresses you
35:34 - know instead of true and false we have
35:36 - the keywords fact and lie won't run in
35:42 - rube mode because America doesn't need
35:44 - your help being great trump is all we
35:46 - need oh my gosh is the only key value
35:48 - pair Trump and Putin interesting I'm
35:58 - curious like why why why people like
36:00 - what inspires people to come up with
36:02 - this kind of stuff you know exactly I
36:05 - mean it's Trump somebody was probably
36:08 - emotional by constructing a wall
36:11 - aka by providing the wall flag so in
36:15 - terminal I think you can pass a flag
36:17 - when you're writing a command in a
36:18 - command line you get past a wall flag if
36:20 - you do that it says Trump's script will
36:22 - refuse to run on machines with Mexican
36:25 - locales man the Mexican developers star
36:33 - probably yes if you if you run like
36:34 - Python example dot py and then before
36:37 - you hit enter you you do - hi
36:39 - you passed a wall flag it will it will
36:42 - if it's a Mexican machine yes so what is
36:51 - the point of this language is it like
36:52 - can you actually build stuff with it
36:53 - usually just I'm sure you can yeah you
36:56 - just you just try it as long as you're
36:58 - not on the windows and it makes a call
37:00 - in Mexico or China or China I'll be
37:04 - tough all right well we should move on
37:10 - to the next one I think we're coming up
37:11 - with an hour soon I'm not sure well okay
37:15 - all right we'll probably got to move
37:16 - faster than yeah and it's easy to type
37:19 - with small hands that's another feature
37:21 - I just saw that okay
37:26 - so language let's move on to number two
37:29 - worse programming language whitespace
37:33 - all right so what's crazy about this
37:35 - whitespace programming language if we
37:37 - pull up whitespace syntax I'll pull it
37:39 - up to right space sounds like a horror
37:44 - movie
37:46 - it's it's made up of just whitespace
37:49 - there there's nothing so like it's
37:51 - showing you all that color but that just
37:53 - means that they're highlighting it how
37:55 - it actually looks like it's just blank
37:57 - there's no letters there no words
37:59 - nothing it's nothing
38:01 - yeah it's just tabs and spaces yeah the
38:03 - entire language so if you scroll down a
38:05 - little bit scroll down more more you're
38:09 - gonna see a document that has nothing on
38:11 - it scroll probably yeah that's actually
38:15 - what the language is doing you literally
38:17 - have to highlight what you wrote to see
38:19 - what you wrote correct Wow but even then
38:21 - you can't really see yeah borders
38:24 - weights do you have to count like how
38:27 - much white space like yeah why space
38:29 - tabs and new lines is how you write code
38:31 - in it not trying to be disrespectful or
38:34 - anything but with this work with like
38:35 - blind people or something because it's
38:37 - like are you gonna say black people that
38:39 - would yeah of course would work with
38:43 - blind people all they it would blind
38:46 - people it would work better than jobs
38:48 - with white person because you're
38:49 - clicking a time to them it's no
38:51 - different than Python or something
38:53 - they're already using drill to them
38:57 - they're already feeling it
38:59 - any feedback we can get on this anybody
39:01 - that's playing that it has a little bit
39:02 - of a reference experience with
39:04 - whitespace talk about a head scratcher
39:05 - man like talk about like you know how
39:07 - much oh my gosh trying to write
39:09 - something like this you're gonna be
39:11 - frustrated all the time really hard is
39:14 - if you get a git diff or after you do a
39:16 - git merge with somebody's code and if to
39:18 - update it that would be a nightmare
39:20 - because when you're showing when they're
39:22 - showing the git diff they also have
39:23 - highlight the white spaces it's like oh
39:25 - man this guy just added all this new
39:27 - colors I'm like - oh forget it approved
39:30 - yeah when you push it it's like oh man
39:32 - it sounds like a nightmare but one cool
39:34 - thing I just read on the Wikipedia page
39:35 - is um it's pretty much like the opposite
39:38 - of all other programming languages
39:39 - because you know most programming
39:40 - languages it ignores all the white space
39:42 - curve this one ignores any non-white
39:44 - space yeah therefore you can actually
39:45 - write programs in a normal program link
39:47 - oh it's white space embedded in Python
39:50 - so this way this would be great for
39:52 - hackers but yeah they can do is they can
39:54 - write look like non-middle moon not a
39:56 - little non-malicious looking code in
39:59 - Python or something
40:00 - it's like printer script but it's
40:03 - actually white yeah using so it only
40:06 - entered the compiler only laser would
40:09 - know would need to know how to run white
40:11 - space right
40:11 - OS X would need to not hurt anybody it's
40:13 - a good program thanks for the in for
40:14 - like the secret code or something right
40:16 - it's like a it's like a little like
40:18 - Morse code as a programming yeah I was
40:20 - like what are they the CIA uses it or
40:22 - something you know I doubt it they're
40:24 - probably not smart enough to use it
40:27 - okay probably because we're a long time
40:29 - let's move on to the number one worst
40:33 - programming language on the planet this
40:35 - will hurt your brain make you cry make
40:37 - you weep it's called what is it called
40:41 - the brain [ __ ] literally yeah that is B
40:48 - are AI n f uck
40:51 - that's correct rain fallin word brain
40:53 - fog programming language I think the
40:55 - intention of the programming language is
40:56 - in the word you know yep and the idea of
41:01 - this programming language to be as
41:02 - esoteric ask complex as
41:06 - um as complicated as possible yep brain
41:10 - fog look at that code that was designed
41:12 - to hurt yeah one of the most frustrating
41:15 - programming languages was built that way
41:18 - on purpose but for a whole idea on yeah
41:21 - so it looks like really painful code
41:24 - that's a great article I think if you
41:25 - scroll down on that one it shows like
41:27 - how some of the code looks 2 by E so
41:31 - lingers is this like a thing it was
41:35 - create a 93 thousand by Swiss physics
41:38 - student named urban Mueller Mueller
41:40 - Mueller hmm I mean it was it was an
41:46 - attempt to create a language with the
41:48 - smallest possible compiler so it was
41:49 - actually like something making the code
41:53 - is hard for humans right but easy as
41:55 - easy as possible for computer like most
41:56 - efficient compiler but it's tearin
41:58 - complete so it actually it can actually
42:00 - write real code and do real stuff can we
42:04 - actually see some syntax that'd be
42:05 - interesting maybe maybe this article
42:08 - does not have syntax right there I
42:09 - imagined it right there oh my gosh so to
42:12 - write hello world this is was how you
42:15 - write it would look like so just
42:19 - listening to this go ahead confused
42:27 - imagine making your Python Django apps
42:29 - with that big so like if it's for
42:32 - anybody who's just listening you would
42:34 - normally write print hello world but in
42:35 - brain [ __ ] you would write like plus
42:37 - plus plus plus bracket greater in the
42:39 - side and period and the crazy stuff what
42:46 - is this so laters another programming
42:49 - language called or rant or Angleton
42:50 - words or anger ten words and it's a spin
42:54 - so brain [ __ ] is a spin off of that
42:56 - language and in that language every
42:59 - character is just the word that's every
43:05 - single word is like that curse how how
43:07 - here's another programming let's call
43:09 - chef which is pretty awesome and
43:10 - everything has to be written like a
43:12 - recipe oh yeah have you seen it
43:15 - yeah yeah I think you went over that
43:16 - yeah everything is run like a recipe and
43:18 - then that's not for
43:19 - oops to like put two tablespoons and
43:22 - then like repeat it yeah everything's
43:25 - related to like cooking looks like a
43:26 - Gordon Ramsay Channel everything yeah
43:28 - but yeah for this language it's just
43:30 - designed to hurt your brain as much as
43:32 - possible and I don't have somebody's
43:35 - ever made programs with this like it's a
43:40 - very low lingual low leg low low level
43:42 - language yeah where you know you're
43:45 - doing with pointers a lot you know you
43:48 - adding your pointer you're in committing
43:50 - porn decreasing your pointer you to
43:52 - check this out okay
43:53 - brain [ __ ] is the ungodly creation of
43:55 - urban Muller whose goal was apparently
43:57 - to create a Turing complete language for
43:59 - which he could write the smallest
44:00 - compiler ever for the Amiga OS 2.0 Amiga
44:06 - ran in Spanish right with a non non
44:10 - cultural people yeah writing compilers
44:12 - sucks
44:13 - you've written a compiler yeah yeah yeah
44:19 - so there you guys have it the top five
44:22 - worst programming languages to learn in
44:25 - 2020 and beyond probably I mean I don't
44:28 - know how far beyond maybe brain [ __ ]
44:30 - the look on the number one most
44:32 - programmers but I am willing to say on
44:34 - record that it won't no probably still
44:36 - be awful and that's it I hope you guys
44:40 - enjoyed the show learn more popular
44:42 - languages like Python or JavaScript or
44:44 - Java or something that's really relevant
44:46 - let us know what programming language
44:48 - was the worst to you so we can create
44:50 - something with it yeah we'll spin we'll
44:55 - spend 24 hours all learning that
44:57 - language and then develop something
44:58 - we'll go to his loft just let's not do
45:04 - brave [ __ ] that like that I feel like
45:05 - that's gonna be a really hard one yeah
45:07 - let's not do that let's do something
45:09 - that'll be like entertaining for them to
45:10 - watch to some script yeah that's better
45:14 - all right guys thank you so much for
45:16 - watching and listening to this subscribe
45:18 - to the channel if you haven't already
45:19 - like this video hit that like button
45:21 - leave a comment
45:23 - we love your face this is cozy this is
