00:00 - here's how I code nowadays take minutes
00:02 - and turn it into no decimals for example
00:04 - if minutes is
00:05 - 3788 it should make it three so I'm just
00:08 - trying to round it down generate code
00:10 - I'm just going to wait a couple of
00:11 - seconds here and boom there's python
00:13 - code it takes in minutes it rounds it
00:14 - down to zero and then it returns it so
00:17 - let's try using this code I'll hit
00:18 - continue and I'm going to test the step
00:21 - and would you look at that I got the
00:23 - result and I actually got 3 minutes back
00:25 - if you want to learn how to code with AI
00:26 - and Chad GPT and use that to make money
00:28 - I've put together a free 20 a training
00:30 - comment the word Ai and I'll send it to
00:32 - you for free
