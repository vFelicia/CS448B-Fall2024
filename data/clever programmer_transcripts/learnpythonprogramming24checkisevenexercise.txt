00:00 - okay guys now let's talk about a new
00:03 - problem alright so I just clicked this
00:05 - part that says check for even number
00:07 - divisibility again if you're on YouTube
00:10 - you're going to have the problem notes
00:12 - below and the solution notes below as
00:14 - well so no need to worry but this is on
00:18 - on clever programmer comm so let's keep
00:20 - going
00:21 - you can write a function or sorry the
00:24 - problem says write a function is even
00:27 - that takes in a number and returns true
00:30 - if it's even otherwise it returns false
00:33 - okay so before you watch the solution
00:38 - take a stab at it and try to do this
00:40 - problem okay and
00:43 - after you're done trying and you're
00:45 - pulling out your hair you're like oh I
00:47 - can't do it come to wash the solution
00:49 - okay I've given you some hints here as
00:52 - well so think about what does it mean
00:54 - for a number to be divisible by another
00:57 - number right so what does it mean let's
01:00 - let's test it out a little bit so if I
01:05 - have 10 and I want to check if it's
01:08 - divisible by two well what does it mean
01:09 - to be divisible it means
01:11 - remainder is what right if I do ten
01:15 - divided by two
01:17 - what's
01:19 - my remainder there right so
01:23 - my remainder here will be none because
01:27 - two goes perfectly into ten and there's
01:30 - a way to check for remainders okay so
01:33 - for example let's let's check if 3 goes
01:36 - into 12
01:38 - right so if my remainder is zero then
01:41 - that means 12 is divisible by 3
01:44 - right I can also try it like this 12
01:47 - divisible by 3 and see if this gives me
01:50 - true or false if it gives me true well
01:52 - then 12 is divisible by 3 if it gives me
01:55 - false then 12 isn't divisible by 3 okay
01:59 - so that's your hint I've given you your
02:02 - example here as well and written format
02:05 - and then I have a bonus challenge for
02:06 - you which says if I give you a number
02:08 - and you check that it's
02:11 - you know if it's even
02:13 - and your function checks is even so that
02:17 - for that function the challenge that I
02:19 - gave you is see if you can write it in
02:20 - one line of code okay but don't try that
02:23 - first try to do it with some if-else
02:26 - statement so it's going to get you to do
02:28 - some FL cygnus okay now let's go over
02:30 - the solution so the first thing i want
02:32 - to do is write
02:35 - what's my function name is even okay it
02:38 - says right there is even
02:40 - another thing that you can do to trick
02:43 - the system is
02:44 - if you look at my test notes below well
02:48 - it kind of tells you what the function
02:50 - is called and how its expecting to use
02:53 - the function it's this is how the
02:55 - function is going to be used right
02:57 - you're going to say is even and pass in
03:00 - a number and either it will give you a
03:02 - true or it'll give you a false so I have
03:04 - test cases here written for you if your
03:07 - function runs correctly all these test
03:09 - cases are going to give you a big thumbs
03:11 - up and the screen is going to print out
03:13 - your code is correct all right
03:16 - so let's say that I give this
03:19 - you know some number and
03:22 - basically what do I do if number is
03:25 - divisible by two
03:29 - right that's how you check if it's
03:31 - divisible by two if you just do this
03:32 - that will tell it well that'll give you
03:34 - the remainder so this will evaluate to
03:37 - zero okay but you want something to
03:41 - evaluate either true or false okay
03:45 - so number mod two should give you zero
03:50 - this means that number should be
03:52 - divisible by two that's what it means to
03:54 - be even right two should be able to go
03:57 - inside of that number
03:59 - return true else
04:02 - return false
04:04 - right if two does not go inside of that
04:07 - number perfectly then I should get back
04:09 - false so like if I tested I don't know
04:12 - thirteen divisible by two check if it's
04:15 - divisible it says false well I can even
04:18 - check out what's left over two goes all
04:21 - the way into twelve and then one spills
04:23 - over and you get a remainder of one
04:24 - hence thirteen is an odd Nam not an even
04:27 - number
04:28 - just in case you don't know what I'd and
04:30 - even numbers are zero two four six eight
04:34 - ten are all evens and then one three
04:36 - five seven up to infinity are all odds
04:40 - you can have negative and positive odds
04:42 - or negative and positive evens all right
04:45 - I also have the notes on my website for
04:48 - you guys to help you so remember how to
04:51 - it tells you how to write a function it
04:53 - tells you where to put the colons it
04:56 - tells you to return things and it gives
04:58 - you an example of the add to function as
05:00 - well so let's test it out I'm going to
05:03 - comment out line 43 and I'm going to run
05:06 - this and if it prints out your code is
05:08 - correct then our code is correct
05:10 - otherwise it's wrong okay
05:12 - good it says your code is correct now
05:16 - I'm going to go over the bonus challenge
05:18 - okay so
05:21 - define
05:24 - bonus challenge kind of or actually I
05:26 - can just do it right here because you
05:28 - guys can pause the video and stuff right
05:30 - so you guys can go back in time as well
05:32 - return and what do I want to do
05:36 - number divisible by two is equal to zero
05:40 - and that's it you don't have to do if
05:43 - you don't have to do else it does it all
05:45 - in one go well what happens here if the
05:48 - number is divisible by zero if the
05:50 - number is divisible by two will give you
05:52 - true if it's divisible if it's not
05:55 - divisible by two gives your false so you
05:57 - don't need to check if
05:59 - this then true otherwise false it kind
06:03 - of does that for you so that's your
06:06 - one-liner okay hopefully this video was
06:09 - helpful for you and you learn something
06:10 - in the next video we're going to find
06:12 - out how to find the length of a string
06:14 - so that's a problem that is going to be
06:17 - really cool and you will be able to try
06:20 - it out check out the show notes below so
06:23 - you can practice this and also try to
06:26 - solve this problem the check for even
06:28 - numbers take care
