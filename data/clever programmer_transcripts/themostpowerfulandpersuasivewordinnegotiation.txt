00:00 - what is up how is it going this is Kazi
00:06 - from clever programmer calm from a
00:13 - hostage situation to getting a $15,000
00:18 - raise to telling your kid to go sleep at
00:23 - 9 p.m. everything at the end of the day
00:29 - comes down to negotiation to getting to
00:34 - that yes today's video is inspired by a
00:40 - book I've been reading recently called
00:43 - never split the difference by Chris Voss
00:47 - and in that book he shares the most
00:54 - powerful and persuasive word that will
01:00 - increase your chances significantly
01:02 - getting to that yes okay how's everybody
01:08 - doing I'm heading to work heading to my
01:12 - office but I thought while I'm doing
01:16 - that and while I'm heading there I make
01:18 - this little video for you so you could
01:23 - have this video and if you actually
01:26 - apply what you learn from this you could
01:29 - actually change the trajectory of your
01:31 - life hello everybody so what is that one
01:38 - really powerful word what is that one
01:41 - persuasive word that can change the
01:44 - trajectory of your life and almost every
01:46 - single negotiation let me preface this
01:49 - with a story okay a lot of people think
01:53 - that the magic thing to get people to
01:55 - say are a lot of yeses in a row and once
01:58 - everybody's another person says a lot of
02:00 - yeses you can then sell them on
02:03 - something so for example imagine
02:05 - somebody calling you like a telemarketer
02:08 - and you pick up the phone and they go
02:10 - well do you like drinking water
02:13 - and here like yeah I think so I do enjoy
02:17 - water and then they're like do you also
02:20 - like being able to live and you're like
02:23 - I guess yeah sure
02:26 - well why don't you buy our new product
02:30 - XYZ because it has these features now
02:35 - what are you gonna say there you're
02:36 - gonna say yes just because you said two
02:38 - yeses before hell no you would just say
02:43 - no and you would cut it off see another
02:51 - example I'll give you right when I was
02:53 - younger I realized that my parents were
02:55 - pretty unreasonable not all the time but
02:58 - sometimes and if they wanted me to do
03:03 - something they would just like keep
03:05 - talking about it keep talking about it
03:06 - and if I ever said no they just wouldn't
03:09 - even listen to me to just keep going so
03:12 - over time what I learned to do is I
03:15 - learned to just listen to them the
03:17 - entire time say yes the whole way
03:22 - through and then actually just ignore
03:25 - them right or afterward after listening
03:29 - to them I just would not do what they
03:31 - had said to give you an example
03:34 - they were like you should become a
03:36 - doctor or you should become a lawyer and
03:38 - they were so hell-bent on it then when I
03:40 - said no they would just like keep going
03:42 - like you're wrong why would you said no
03:45 - look at other kids did it uh so then
03:48 - what I started doing is I simply started
03:51 - saying yes I do want to become a doctor
03:54 - I will do it and then at the end I had
03:59 - no urge and I actually ended up not
04:00 - doing it so I just lied to their face
04:04 - that is exactly also what happens if
04:07 - somebody tried to come to convert you to
04:10 - their religion right what would happen
04:12 - or if somebody comes to recruit you you
04:14 - just kind of say yes just so they can
04:17 - stop harassing you and then you just
04:20 - don't do it so to bring this full circle
04:24 - and tell you what is the actual most
04:27 - important thing and the most persuasive
04:29 - word that actually starts any reasonable
04:33 - negotiation and that's the word no okay
04:37 - and oh no most people think that this is
04:47 - actually where a negotiation ends
04:50 - Christina you're the best hi guys thank
04:53 - you guys I am seeing what you guys are
04:54 - saying in chat but I'm just like so
04:58 - focused on this video that sometimes I
05:00 - miss it but I will respond at the end of
05:03 - this video but back to the back to the
05:06 - point most people think that no is
05:09 - actually where the negotiation or the
05:11 - conversation ends that is actually where
05:15 - the negotiation starts that's where the
05:18 - negotiation actually begins so if you're
05:21 - on the end where you're trying to
05:23 - negotiate with somebody get to the know
05:26 - as fast as possible because if they're
05:31 - saying no to you that means they are
05:33 - telling you the truth and that means you
05:37 - actually have a chance okay so the dudes
05:42 - who are watching if a girl is saying no
05:46 - to you and you're like hey or maybe we
05:48 - should go on a date well that doesn't
05:51 - mean a yes and don't jump in to start
05:53 - harassing her because I feel like that's
05:55 - what some people do but if you're a
05:57 - little bit intelligent you would know
06:00 - that that's actually just the beginning
06:02 - of a negotiation that's actually just a
06:05 - start when it comes to you asking for a
06:08 - raise
06:12 - and the other person saying no that's
06:16 - actually the start of the negotiation
06:18 - when you ask for like okay I want you
06:23 - know I want I want to do this software
06:24 - developer job they're giving you the job
06:26 - instead of just being like okay I'll
06:28 - accept it for $50,000 thank you so much
06:30 - oh my god if you say you counter offer
06:34 - them an $80,000 and then they're like
06:36 - that's actually way too high this
06:37 - ridiculous what are you doing and then
06:39 - they're like this sends you a
06:42 - counteroffer and they say we can we can
06:44 - do 65 now are you gonna sit in a corner
06:47 - and cry because you didn't get your 80
06:49 - or are you gonna sit in the middle of
06:53 - the street happy smiling enjoying
06:56 - yourself because instead of getting 50
07:00 - you now have 65 from just getting one no
07:05 - okay so this is what opens up a dialog
07:12 - all right and back in the day when I
07:16 - would tell my parents no when they would
07:19 - tell me to be a doctor or a lawyer those
07:23 - were the days I was open to listening to
07:25 - them and hearing them out on why I
07:28 - should become a lawyer or a doctor when
07:31 - I grew up but when they could not
07:35 - explain it to me and when I was
07:36 - convinced that that is not the right
07:39 - path and these two my parents are not
07:42 - the people who ever be able to convince
07:44 - me of this and when I gave up all hope
07:46 - on that that's when I actually just told
07:48 - them yes without ever saying no that's
07:51 - when I became the perfect son that they
07:53 - enjoyed because I learned that I could
07:56 - just lie to them not do what they want
08:01 - but still make them feel happy for it
08:03 - and then go on and do my own thing okay
08:06 - so until if somebody just stopped saying
08:08 - no it's you completely watch out there's
08:13 - some kind of agenda or something going
08:16 - on that you don't know about and you're
08:21 - not gonna one get your desired result
08:23 - and it means the other person is not
08:25 - being honest with you
08:26 - you or they're not listening to you okay
08:30 - so when somebody's agreeing with you all
08:34 - the way that's actually not the right
08:36 - thing no is a beautiful beautiful word
08:40 - look for it look for objections look for
08:45 - obstacles and once they come up embrace
08:50 - them enjoy them relax breathe in deeply
08:52 - and then go from there that's what opens
08:54 - up the dialogue this is what I wanted to
08:57 - share with you guys and I hope that you
09:03 - found this valuable I hope that you
09:05 - enjoyed this video that I'm making in
09:08 - this weird little parking lot for you
09:11 - but I'm gonna start heading to work now
09:13 - the content of the video is over but
09:16 - I'll answer some questions at this point
09:18 - as well as start engaging with you guys
09:21 - so Eric bus hi Lilia how are you doing
09:27 - lots of heart eyes let me try to make

09:33 - worst hi Elvira
09:38 - she says excellent point thank you where
09:41 - are you right now I'm in LA if you're
09:46 - such a good program why don't you code I
09:49 - run a company now called clever
09:51 - programmer our goal is to reach millions
09:54 - of people which we are doing and our
09:57 - goal is to get the entire world to code
10:00 - so that's the mission I'm on and that's
10:05 - the mission my team is on and it's a
10:08 - powerful mission and it's a type of
10:10 - mission that doesn't allow me to
10:11 - actually just sit there and code all the
10:13 - time because that would be a little
10:15 - selfish though that's what I would love
10:16 - to do actually Christina you're very
10:18 - welcome how can I switch
10:23 - how can I switch to software developing
10:26 - from web developing just one google it -
10:33 - you can switch - yeah just literally
10:41 - google it because you're going to be
10:43 - doing more computer science e stuff
10:48 - [Music]
10:54 - [Music]
10:59 - smooth answer how to get into hybrid
11:03 - apps I wish I knew I have no idea to get
11:08 - into hybrid apps I've never done it hi
11:13 - I'm butch Kumar he says call my name why
11:15 - do I love programming it lets me take
11:17 - whatever it is in here
11:18 - turn it into reality and so if I turn it
11:21 - into an application and you download
11:23 - that application you start using it it
11:25 - literally feels like you're entering in
11:27 - my cerebral cortex and now you're
11:29 - actually in my universe playing around
11:31 - which is which is kind of cool
11:39 - well that was fast card or bike
11:53 - I'm almost at my work place so I'm gonna
11:57 - take a few more questions and I'm going

12:01 - questions drop them down below and I'll
12:05 - take the time now to answer them
12:15 - denne asked about see I'm a Python guy
12:18 - so I can't really help you would see my
12:19 - friend what about costs cross-platform
12:22 - apps flutter no idea about flutter
12:33 - do I need to learn JavaScript before
12:35 - Django or Flass no you can just go and
12:39 - start learning Django and flask and pick
12:42 - up JavaScript along the way but don't go
12:46 - down the rabbit hole of like spending
12:47 - years learning JavaScript and then going
12:50 - don't do that
12:50 - I think scratch is a fantastic way to
12:53 - start I think adults should actually
12:54 - start with scratch as well
13:04 - what coding boot camps do I suggest full
13:08 - sack Academy is really good which a
13:17 - library do I like I want to work with
13:20 - machine learning having done much Thank
13:24 - You Vicky that's it guys
13:27 - I'm gonna bounce my light is about to
13:31 - turn green
13:31 - thank you guys so much for coming as
