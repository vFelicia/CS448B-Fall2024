04:10 - now it should be showing up
04:14 - correctly awesome so I'm going to put
04:16 - this away it's called intro to
04:19 - programming by John zel it's an
04:21 - unbelievable book like you create these
04:23 - apps you create some you don't really
04:25 - create like lots of apps but you're
04:27 - really learning the fundamentals of
04:29 - program pring and I think it's a great
04:32 - great book um can it be the first 50
04:36 - people um no it's going to be the first
04:39 - 15 people that actually get this book

04:46 - uh for the people who are actually in
04:48 - this Live cast so you're going to you
04:51 - know once you sign up you're going to
04:52 - get the our emails basically to connect
04:55 - with us want you to just tell us and say
04:58 - hey I joined during your Live cast kazy
05:01 - said he'll give me a book I'll sign
05:04 - it well this with this pen right here
05:08 - right
05:10 - here okay and I will ship it out to your
05:16 - home free of
05:20 - charge all
05:25 - right
05:27 - awesome um
05:31 - all right let's see I'm going to start
05:33 - answering you guys's questions I signed
05:36 - up all I see are some videos is that all
05:39 - or is there more there is going to be
05:41 - constantly new content added to the
05:44 - course also the some videos that you see
05:47 - actually are projects that when I give
05:49 - you these assignments it's going to take
05:51 - you a long time to do them so um don't
05:55 - worry about the length it's about the
05:57 - quality of the videos Okay so so the
06:00 - content is very powerful lots of
06:02 - students are getting great results with
06:03 - a student David build an app in 2 hours
06:06 - 2 hours we have a student his name is
06:10 - Dennis he has a website called the happy
06:12 - mindset.com
06:14 - uh he's killing it he already has a job
06:17 - he's doing real really well we have
06:19 - another student his name is David um he
06:23 - built a really cool graphical user
06:25 - interface application he's a freelancer
06:27 - he's actually in slack so you guys can
06:29 - once you join I'm not making these
06:30 - people up you can talk with them okay
06:32 - and I've also put them in my email and
06:34 - he made something for Tobias guitar.com
06:37 - and he basically links his app to it so
06:39 - it makes all of his stuff easier he's
06:42 - using this so then he can actually
06:43 - charge more as a freelancer I think it's
06:45 - a really cool idea that he's learning
06:47 - programming skills to help him with his
06:49 - um freelancing
06:51 - capabilities we have you know obviously
06:54 - the infamous Kitty which you guys at
06:56 - this point all know about she has her
06:58 - website it's called The Savvy coder.com
07:01 - and she built it after joining you know
07:04 - uh after she became part of clever
07:05 - programmer she got motivated she put
07:07 - together her website and now she's also
07:10 - blogging on that website so which is
07:13 - super cool uh Kevin Moreno
07:16 - joined great this is awesome uh Fanny
07:20 - Wong joined a just a little bit before
07:25 - that all right let's see
07:31 - so payment plans there's a three-month
07:34 - payment plan okay where you pay $33 for
07:38 - three months and the course is
07:40 - yours there is a one payment which is
07:44 - $97 the course is yours again just a
07:47 - reminder the course is about being able
07:50 - to create your very own python apps and
07:54 - 7 days or less from scratch uh you get
07:57 - live sessions you know with all of the
08:00 - students actually there you get
08:03 - personalized emails so just to keep you
08:05 - on track hold you accountable I check in

08:21 - responses the course will be customized
08:23 - for you okay time to take the hat off
08:27 - boom
08:29 - so I think that's going to be pretty
08:31 - cool
08:32 - um yeah okay more questions let's see
08:36 - I'm your follower from from Italy nice
08:40 - Issa how did you learn
08:43 - programming um I learned programming
08:45 - through many different resources which I
08:47 - talked about probably throughout the
08:49 - whole day but I'll just mention them
08:51 - again okay um I learned through corsera
08:55 - intro to computer programming part one
08:58 - intro to computer programming part two
09:00 - principles of computing part one
09:02 - principles of computing part two then I
09:04 - took intro to computer science at
09:05 - Udacity that was really cool then I took
09:07 - some courses at College um let's see a
09:12 - little bit of free code Camp you know
09:14 - team Treehouse I mean everything okay
09:17 - another student just joined I'm going to
09:19 - announce his
09:23 - name great Christian Christian
09:28 - neelsen um awesome if you
09:36 - joined um no so Josh Newman it's not
09:40 - about the first 10 people in the Stream
09:42 - it's actually the first 10 people who
09:45 - buy the course while watching the stream
09:48 - they get this book sent to them okay so
09:53 - that's a bonus for you guys so once you
09:55 - join the course this is I think a 20 $20
09:59 - you know amazing book and you get
10:03 - it free of cost and you get my signature
10:07 - on there all
10:10 - right uh programming necessary for
10:12 - ethical hacker uh I'm not sure about
10:15 - this question let's see
10:17 - um no no not necessary all right other
10:27 - questions okay another another student
10:29 - joined his name is Frank welcome Frank I
10:33 - mean guys this is exciting like we are
10:36 - in the home stretch we have literally
10:39 - hundreds of students enrolling at this
10:41 - point like we have hundreds of students
10:43 - enrolled this is really cool like we had
10:46 - when we started we didn't have anybody
10:48 - now clever programmer has grown to
10:50 - 10,000 students enrolled in the program
10:52 - we just got another student boom Lamar
10:56 - Roberts you're in I see that right here
10:59 - um
10:59 - Frank van is here awesome guys this is
11:03 - exciting
11:04 - great so you know I'm I'm really excited
11:08 - about this because we are really
11:10 - building something powerful here right
11:12 - we got 10,000 of you guys to enroll at
11:15 - clever programmer and now because of you
11:17 - guys it's a massive thing the YouTube
11:20 - channel is an amazing thing and now
11:22 - finally this course we're getting so
11:24 - many students and we're getting all of
11:26 - you guys and especially with that energy
11:29 - and that whole group like I think we can
11:32 - achieve some really exciting stuff and
11:34 - get really good results whether it's
11:36 - really earning a higher income whether
11:39 - it's you just really want to learn get a
11:41 - deeper understanding of programming
11:43 - whether it is like you want to actually
11:44 - work at a professional job software
11:47 - consultant what consultant whatever it
11:49 - is this course will give you the
11:51 - fundamental tools to start heading in
11:53 - those directions to start getting
11:54 - results and also I focus on getting your
11:57 - return and an investment so I'm going to
11:59 - going to be honing that point in
12:00 - constantly how you can actually the
12:02 - investment you make into this course how
12:04 - you can get that back right right when
12:07 - you get out of this course and again
12:10 - just a few reframes uh and to understand
12:12 - what this course is really offering and
12:14 - to put it into perspective is for $97
12:17 - you get lifetime access to everything so
12:20 - when I add bonuses and when I add new
12:22 - upgrades to the content and when I add
12:24 - new videos new projects live sessions
12:28 - one one call with you it's free to you
12:32 - any additional stuff is free when this
12:34 - course relaunches it's going to be a
12:36 - higher price and just to put it into
12:39 - more perspective is like thinkful which
12:41 - is an online coding boot camp charges
12:43 - you
12:45 - $500 a month to provide a much poorer
12:48 - experience than what I'm actually
12:50 - offering you and the reason how I know
12:51 - this is I was in the thinkful program
12:54 - and again same thing with Linda corsera
12:58 - and Udacity
12:59 - uh you know they they don't actually
13:01 - provide you the community of other
13:02 - students so this is providing uh you
13:06 - know you with the community of students
13:08 - who are driven dedicated just like you
13:11 - so you guys can collaborate and build
13:12 - something awesome
13:14 - together all right more questions um
13:19 - python was not invented by Google it was
13:21 - invented by Ros some something I forgot
13:24 - his last name or whatever but um
13:27 - basically python is a a very powerful
13:29 - language just in case you guys some of
13:31 - you guys don't know python you know
13:35 - Instagram was built off of python I've
13:36 - said this so many times but I'm sure
13:38 - that some of you guys are new here and
13:40 - don't haven't heard this yet but python
13:43 - you know Instagram is built off of
13:45 - python 450 plus million and
13:48 - growing right and that is based on by
13:52 - inst uh and that's powered by python
13:55 - Pinterest is python you know one of the
13:57 - three major languages used atog Google
13:59 - is python so with python you can make
14:01 - even Android applications using their
14:03 - kyv framework to working at Nasa you
14:06 - know doing data sign stuff doing image
14:08 - recognition doing video recognition
14:09 - doing data analytics or you could be
14:12 - creating games with it or you could just
14:14 - be writing software to automate a lot of
14:16 - the stuff you do okay just some stuff
14:18 - you do for fun all right Alexander
14:22 - Moreno has
14:24 - joined every every time somebody joins
14:26 - we get a phone call here great
14:29 - we got some more stuff um I mean guys
14:33 - the return on your investment is really
14:35 - simple like you teach two people what
14:37 - you learn from this course what you can
14:39 - do in probably a week after learning
14:41 - stuff from this course you can charge
14:43 - those people let's say very minimal you
14:46 - know usually you can start off at $50 an
14:48 - hour but let's say you said $20 an hour
14:50 - you just give them Five Lessons and your
14:52 - money is back for the course okay
14:54 - lifetime access for $97 there's no
14:56 - monthly fee here just lifetime access so
15:00 - again that's not going to be the case
15:02 - the price of this course is going to be
15:06 - increasing
15:07 - um yep so when the time is over the
15:10 - registration closes um I go offline um
15:14 - and unfortunately you won't be able to
15:17 - join the course anymore okay so I'm
15:19 - going to update this and I'm going to
15:21 - say that basically cor closes in five
15:25 - minutes uh Josh Newman it's totally okay
15:29 - if you can't get it okay I'll still be
15:32 - here I'm not going anywhere okay uh this
15:35 - course will be live again for you maybe
15:37 - you'll be ready then plus 99% of my
15:40 - stuff is free on on YouTube and even on
15:44 - Clever program.com so use it and get a
15:48 - lot of value out of
15:49 - it um I would suggest if you are going
15:54 - to be busy I would still suggest get it
15:56 - now because you lock it in at the
15:58 - current price and then you can use it
16:00 - later let's say you just never used it
16:02 - and you even went over the 30-day money
16:04 - back guarantee I'll just return you your
16:07 - money because I'll be able to see that
16:08 - you haven't used it okay uh I'm not here
16:11 - to nickel and dime you but I am here to
16:13 - hold you accountable so you can be
16:15 - successful this is not a Magic Bullet
16:17 - everything is going to be perfect course
16:18 - this is we're going to be involved in
16:21 - this course this is not the I'm going to
16:23 - take this and throw this in the trash
16:25 - course this is the we're going to work
16:27 - together and make sure you get your
16:29 - results and achieve your goals course
16:31 - okay so that's why everybody's going to
16:33 - be involved that's why this is so
16:36 - exciting right this is not just your
16:37 - average udemy course you just take throw
16:40 - it in your library of
16:43 - courses all right
16:46 - um so yeah uh I would say lock it in at
16:50 - the current price again 30-day money
16:51 - back guarantee right that just should
16:53 - just make it a no-brainer you get it now
16:56 - you don't like it you call me um um and
16:59 - like I say you know I'm going to get
17:00 - upset I'll probably cry a little bit in
17:02 - the corner but then I'll send you your
17:04 - refund um I'll call to I'll call you an
17:07 - apologize and I will give you a one free
17:11 - one hour one-on-one session with me okay
17:13 - personal coaching session that's
17:15 - normally valued over $150 for an hour
17:18 - okay you're going to get that for free
17:21 - because I just stand behind you know
17:23 - what I offer that much okay so take
17:27 - advantage of that as well Violeta joined
17:31 - great excited to have you
17:34 - Violeta
17:36 - okay oh Facebook live just fell
17:40 - off all right here we go Violeta just
17:43 - joined uh Violeta
17:45 - Bishi
17:47 - awesome she joined okay yeah there's
17:50 - also PayPal so if you want to do um you
17:54 - know onetime payment you can there's a
17:55 - three-month payment plan with PayPal you
17:57 - can do debit card or credit card so that
18:01 - works all right let's see what other
18:03 - questions we
18:07 - got uh Ajax if you joined before the
18:10 - deadline which was supposed to be
18:11 - yesterday at 8 or 900 p.m. Central
18:14 - Standard Time if you bought the op
18:17 - course then you get slack Channel for
18:18 - free right now slack channel is
18:21 - $47
18:27 - okay uh course was not ever free for
18:31 - anybody uh the O python create apps
18:34 - course which is designed to help you
18:36 - create apps it takes you from uh just
18:39 - writing code to actually being able to
18:41 - create full apps so the O course was
18:45 - actually never free from the start uh in
18:47 - the start when I launched it it was
18:50 - $49 and a bunch of you guys missed that
18:52 - time to buy it a bunch of you guys
18:54 - waited and then a lot of you guys
18:56 - actually bought it at $97 price points I
18:58 - was kind of laughing like you know you
19:00 - didn't pull the trigger then and now
19:02 - you're pulling it at what price point
19:04 - when it's doubled and the next time when
19:06 - I launch it is probably going to be
19:07 - doubled or tripled or even more because
19:10 - the value of this courses is going to be
19:11 - unbelievable like and it has already
19:14 - been unbelievable like just one of the
19:16 - students made
19:17 - $1,000 you know just this month from one
19:20 - of our free videos so people are getting
19:22 - results people are students are building
19:24 - their own websites students are booking
19:26 - new clients I mean so the result results
19:29 - are awesome together we're going to make
19:31 - this an even better course we're going
19:32 - to build it together and you know help
19:35 - you get the results that you want
19:37 - so um you know if you're really debating
19:40 - and you're on the edge the worst case
19:42 - scenario you get it and then you can
19:44 - think about okay maybe I want to you
19:46 - know I I would get it now if I was in
19:48 - your situation if you have the funds
19:50 - that's that's what where's the PayPal
19:53 - select same place uh click that link in
19:56 - the you know this is the page and it'll
19:58 - show show you there's a PayPal option
20:00 - just scroll down enough that's the link
20:03 - okay uh the apps that I've created are
20:05 - on GitHub you can see them I even show
20:07 - my apps in videos uh just one of the
20:10 - apps that I show you guys is called
20:12 - agile directions which you guys can even
20:14 - play with most of the apps are built
20:15 - commercially so like you know I can't
20:18 - show those to you guys because they're
20:20 - private software but the other apps that
20:22 - I have they're completely online they're
20:24 - on my github.com and also on my YouTube
20:27 - channels um you know in the description
20:30 - boxes I actually link them so you can
20:32 - click them also on my website when you
20:34 - go to my blog post I put my apps there
20:36 - for you guys to check out all right
20:39 - let's
20:52 - see uh Kiki yes you can always learn for
20:56 - free uh but you just get faster results
21:00 - when you get high quality stuff that's
21:02 - just a fact I bought a $4,000 course
21:05 - it's called zero to launch just a few
21:06 - days ago like few not days ago but
21:08 - months ago um and it's really designed
21:12 - to help you with your business and uh
21:15 - it's really helping it help has helped
21:16 - me scale uh clever programmer like
21:21 - insanely um so yeah there was a price
21:25 - that I had to pay but then the results I
21:27 - got which was was much more unrealistic
21:30 - than what normal people get okay so
21:32 - they're always good free stuff I've
21:35 - always always used it but one hack I
21:37 - used to do when I was taking corsera
21:39 - courses was I would pay $50 before the
21:42 - course even start um $50 for the
21:45 - certificate um so then even though I
21:48 - could have taken the course for free it
21:49 - was so I could be committed to take that
21:52 - course okay so that was just a hack I
21:56 - used all right let's see
