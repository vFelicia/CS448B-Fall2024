00:00 - - Hey, guys, what's up?
00:01 - So in this video I wanna talk
about primitive data types.
00:05 - Now we're getting into the
adult programming stuff, okay?
00:08 - Getting out of the little
bit of the baby stuff.
00:10 - Even though it's not baby, but,
00:13 - you know, let's just submit it.
00:15 - So, let's talk about primitive data types.
00:18 - What are they?
00:19 - (mumbles)
00:22 - Let's start out with some
basic ones first, okay?
00:25 - And I also want to clarify something
00:27 - about variables for you guys.
00:29 - So, you can't start a
variable with a number, okay?
00:33 - So if you said 5 is equal to,
I don't know, 'hello', right?
00:38 - The string 'hello',
you're gonna get an error.
00:41 - So you gotta start it,
00:42 - you gotta start your
variable with a letter.
00:45 - Now you also can't start it with symbols.
00:47 - You can't say something like this
00:49 - is equal to 'hello', 'kay?
00:51 - You're gonna get an error.
00:54 - You can combine underscores
with your variables.
00:56 - You can say hi_hello
01:00 - something like this, okay?
01:01 - And that would work for you.
01:04 - Okay, primitive data types, what are they?
01:07 - So, if I have this thing
in the green that you see,
01:11 - that is a string, alright?
01:14 - So, in this video,
01:17 - I think we can just
keep it like this. 'Kay.
01:21 - So that's a string: 'hello'
01:23 - Anything with a quotes around it,
01:25 - and you can also put
double quotes if you want,
01:27 - this is a string data type.
01:30 - This terminology is very
important to remember.
01:34 - Then you have your integers.
01:36 - Integers are anything that is like this:
01:40 - 4.3 (mumbles) 4
01:44 - 5 , 2
01:45 - Those are all your integers, obviously.
01:49 - Things that have decimal points,
01:51 - in math, they are called decimal numbers.
01:53 - In python, we call them floating numbers.
01:56 - Okay? So you have floating numbers.
01:58 - Like 455.5 ; four hundred and...
02:01 - 354.90
02:07 - Okay? These are your floating numbers.
02:10 - So, that's another
important thing to remember.
02:14 - So, this was just a little
primer on primitive data types.
02:19 - Just so when I use this terminology,
02:21 - you guys don't get confused,
02:22 - or like want to throw things
at your screen, right?
02:26 - Like, "I don't know what
he's talking about!" Boom!
02:29 - Just, throw your mouse or
your socks, don't do that.
02:34 - I'm telling you what they are here,
02:37 - and feel free to look
them up a little bit more
02:39 - so you can understand more about them.
02:42 - But this is some of the basic ones
02:44 - we're going to be dealing with,
02:45 - and in the next video I'm
gonna talk about things like
02:48 - what is a list? What is a dictionary?
02:51 - So we're gonna go over
those as well, m'kay?
02:54 - Just to give you a little
foreshadowing into it
02:57 - for you advanced people there.
02:59 - You wanna learn more, right?
03:01 - You want to overachieve.
03:03 - A list is basically something
03:05 - that holds multiple things at once.
03:08 - So, for example, I can
say 'banana' and 'apple'
03:13 - and 'oranges', like this, right?
03:17 - And at the start I can say x is equal to.
03:21 - I hate x. I hate one letter variables,
03:23 - and most python people do as well
03:26 - because it's usually a sign of bad coding.
03:29 - Always try to make your
names very relevant.
03:31 - Get into that habit right now.
03:33 - Promise yourself. Cross your heart.
03:36 - I don't care what you have to do,
03:38 - but work hard on variable naming.
03:41 - Even if it slows you down sometimes.
03:43 - So no x, no y. Only if you have to.
03:47 - It's gonna make your
code really hard to read,
03:49 - and when you're reasoning
through your logic,
03:51 - you're gonna not understand
what you were doing.
03:52 - So, let's say, I don't know,
03:55 - fruits is a good variable name. fruits.
03:58 - And now, if I call fruits,
04:02 - you see a list of that thing.
04:03 - Okay, I was talking about
primitive data types,
04:06 - but I got ahead of myself.
04:07 - I started talking about
some data structures
04:09 - like a list and dictionaries.
04:11 - We'll cover all that later. Be patient.
04:14 - I'll see you guys in the next video.
