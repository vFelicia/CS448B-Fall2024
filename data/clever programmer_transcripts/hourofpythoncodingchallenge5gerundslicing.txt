00:05 - hey guys how's it going this is Kazi
00:08 - from clever programmer common this video
00:10 - we're going to be doing the gerund
00:12 - slicing challenge hopefully I'm
00:14 - pronouncing the word right I didn't
00:16 - learn grammar in United States learn it
00:19 - back home anyways we have done the
00:23 - reverse slicing challenge so our word
00:25 - zebra index challenges switch-case
00:26 - challenge uppercase challenge lowercase
00:28 - challenge if you haven't done it already
00:29 - go check out those videos from before
00:32 - and if you want to do this challenge is
00:34 - live you can do it right below this
00:36 - video on my website the coding thing is
00:38 - right there if you're on youtube there's
00:40 - a link in the description what you feel
00:41 - free to watch it right where you are
00:43 - okay so let's get this thing let's get
00:47 - this show on the road
00:48 - gerund infinitive so basically what this
00:51 - challenge says for you to do is if I
00:55 - gave you something like building
00:56 - anything that ends with an egg right I
01:01 - can't think of any examples end with an
01:03 - Inc well anything that ends with an an
01:07 - egg what we do is we return it as like
01:12 - for example if I give you building you
01:14 - return to build right if I gave you
01:17 - billing you give me back to Bill okay oh
01:24 - yeah here's another one singing if I
01:26 - gave you singing you give me back to
01:28 - saying if I give you dancing giving back
01:30 - to dance
01:32 - oh well that's actually a little
01:33 - complicated we'll keep it simple but for
01:36 - so for Bill you should be able to do
01:38 - that and for building you should be able
01:40 - to give me the right thing
01:41 - alright so let's jump into that and if I
01:44 - give you something that's not adjourned
01:46 - infinitive then just give me back that's
01:49 - not a gerund okay something that's not a
01:51 - gerund just say you know that's not a
01:54 - German so this literally the string on
01:56 - line 8 is what you should give me back
01:57 - okay so let's get into this so how would
02:03 - you do it take a stab at it actively
02:05 - code this up try comment your solution
02:08 - below otherwise I'm going to solve this
02:12 - and I'm doing this live
02:13 - you guys are going to hear my thinking
02:15 - process okay all right so if I get a
02:19 - string and the last three letters of it
02:23 - are ing how would I do it I would say
02:33 - here's how I would do it this I'm
02:37 - thinking of the simplest way to do it so
02:38 - I would slice it can I slice it from
02:42 - negative three all the way to the end I
02:46 - think that's possible
02:48 - let's go and check it out so what I do
02:49 - is I open up my command line and then I
02:52 - try things in here as well so let's try
02:57 - it let's get hello and I'll try to index
03:01 - it like this and it works right from
03:06 - negative three all the way to the end
03:08 - and what if it was something like this
03:10 - it still works so great so I'll say go
03:14 - from negative three all the way to the
03:17 - end and if it's equal to ing right then
03:25 - what we do is we return that string we
03:35 - return to plus let's put a little space
03:40 - here right accounting for this space and
03:43 - we say string from can we do from start
03:53 - up until negative three that way this
03:55 - negative three isn't included in there
03:57 - it's kind of weird I think that should
04:00 - work so what I would do is I open up my
04:02 - terminal
04:03 - if you're on Windows open up your idle
04:05 - if you're on iMac if you don't have idle
04:08 - which it just means you have an
04:09 - installed Python so install Python first
04:12 - of all or just coat it in the thing
04:14 - below and hit that play button right
04:16 - this play button and then it should work
04:17 - for you now let's go back here and let's
04:21 - try this thing here right so I'm going
04:25 - to paste it and I'm going to replace the
04:27 - as with building see what it gives me
04:32 - what's here oh yeah to build okay that
04:37 - actually looks like it works I was
04:39 - surprisingly good how I was able to
04:41 - solve it and you'll be able to say that
04:44 - too when you can solve these coding
04:45 - challenges that's the bonus all right so
04:48 - I have to build and if it's not
04:51 - something that ends with ing right so we
04:54 - can say else we will say I'm too lazy to
05:01 - type so I'll copy this guy from here and
05:03 - I'll paste it and just wrap it because
05:06 - it's a string and this should work let's
05:09 - give it a try
05:10 - okay building we got to build for build
05:14 - we got that's not a gerund all right
05:18 - hopefully that was insightful and
05:22 - awesome for you guys to watch and do it
05:24 - live with me I know a lot of you
05:26 - watching got tripped up on that and
05:28 - that's okay
05:29 - it just means you need to practice think
05:30 - about a little bit more and what I would
05:33 - do follows you when I can't solve
05:34 - something I try to forget about the
05:36 - solution right I come back to it a day
05:38 - later and try to just do it from scratch
05:41 - but not just by like randomly putting in
05:43 - random things in the code I'll take a
05:45 - piece of paper and step through
05:47 - everything and see if I can truly
05:49 - understand and gain a deep understanding
05:50 - of what it was
05:52 - hand-waving is single-handedly the most
05:56 - disruptive thing you can do to your
05:59 - improving your coding skills and by
06:01 - hand-waving I mean it's like oh that's
06:03 - just simple I got it I got it
06:05 - of course after you see the solution
06:07 - it's so simple it makes sense remember
06:10 - high insight is 20/20 but when you try
06:13 - to code it right ah completely from
06:16 - scratch and from a blank canvas it's
06:20 - going to be more difficult and that's
06:21 - generally how you start off coding
06:24 - anything any even big project right you
06:26 - start off from a blank canvas so that's
06:29 - why it's good to practice like come back
06:31 - to it a day later don't hand wave and
06:33 - just go oh I got it I got it if you
06:35 - messed it up go back to the drawing
06:37 - board come back a day later and try to
06:39 - do it from scratch
06:40 - okay all right guys that's it for this
06:43 - video thank you so much for watching I
06:46 - love your guys faces off and as always
06:48 - I'll see you in the next video
