00:00 - hi so just a little bit about mutable
00:03 - data types versus immutable data types
00:06 - essentially to mutate or mutability or
00:11 - mutable essentially means something that
00:14 - can change they will use this
00:16 - terminology and computer programming
00:18 - world to confuse the hell out of you but
00:21 - essentially it's just telling you that
00:23 - something can change and in and
00:25 - immutable just means something that
00:27 - cannot change okay so for example I
00:31 - don't know some things might be
00:34 - immutable like I might consider maybe my
00:36 - glass is immutable they're really hard
00:38 - to change and they're I mean it's really
00:41 - hard to change something about it and
00:43 - that is just what it is right and maybe
00:46 - my keys might be a little bit more
00:50 - mutable like I can add things to my
00:52 - keychain and I can take things away from
00:55 - my keychain right so that might be an
00:59 - example of something that's immutable
01:02 - versus something that might be
01:04 - potentially mutable you know your wallet
01:08 - you can change things you can add things
01:10 - to it you can take things out but maybe
01:13 - from a cup it's a little bit harder I
01:15 - might almost consider it an immutable
01:18 - thing if you could put something in it
01:20 - but these are examples are just to give
01:23 - you some kind of intuition as to how
01:25 - these things work but in the real world
01:28 - you know you have you're doing data
01:31 - analysis on a lot of sensitive
01:33 - information you want to store that as a
01:36 - tuple where it's harder to change it or
01:39 - if pairs of things go together like for
01:42 - example your name and your email address
01:46 - that's something that goes together as a
01:49 - pair then maybe you could put that you
01:51 - can create a list that contains tuples
01:54 - inside of it so the first element of
01:57 - that list could be a tuple containing my
02:01 - name and my email address and then the
02:03 - second element in that list could be
02:04 - your name and your email address and so
02:08 - on and so forth
02:09 - and and the reason why there are tuple
02:12 - is because you can't
02:13 - things out from it really easily or you
02:15 - can you can't add things to it really
02:17 - easily so generally stick with a list
02:20 - until you can figure out when to use
02:23 - both of them and then start using tuples
02:25 - but for now play around with tuple a
02:28 - little bit figure it out get a sense of
02:30 - it okay in the next video we're going to
02:32 - talk about another data type you tell me
02:35 - this time okay you that whether is it a
02:39 - mutable data type or an immutable data
02:43 - type okay by leaving that in the
02:44 - comments alright guys that's it for this
02:47 - video and I'll see you in the next video
02:52 - [Music]
