00:00 - hey you what's up this is Kazi from
00:03 - clever programmer calm and I have a very
00:07 - special video coming for you guys
00:09 - tomorrow it is going to teach you how
00:12 - you can use your current skills or your
00:15 - skills in any other thing aside from
00:17 - programming and then actually combine it
00:19 - with coding so I think this video is
00:22 - going to be very valuable for you and it
00:24 - took me a long time to kind of put this
00:26 - together it has a little bit of the
00:27 - chess stories in it as well that I
00:30 - covered at the chess state championships
00:32 - tournament so if you watch my live
00:34 - streams and maybe you saw that and if
00:37 - you didn't that's totally fine so I
00:39 - wanted to kind of tell you guys about
00:42 - that another thing I wanted to answer
00:44 - was nickels question which I'm sorry to
00:46 - kill I couldn't answer for the last few
00:47 - days there are tons of questions I have
00:50 - to answer so I am very excited I'm very
00:53 - happy that you were very patient with me
00:55 - but I'm gonna take a stab at an answer
00:57 - it now so nickels question goes friends
01:01 - or coding okay I broke his paragraph
01:04 - question down into like three words
01:06 - essentially so he's just wondering okay
01:09 - if I'm dealing with coding then I kind
01:11 - of feel bad that I'm not spending enough
01:13 - time with friends I'm gonna answer this
01:15 - question figure out how much you want to
01:20 - code right for me I was like 20 hours a
01:23 - day 18 hours a day I just go crazy
01:25 - whatever skill or whatever new thing
01:27 - that I'm learning I just want to go
01:28 - crazy in it and just learn the hell out
01:30 - of it
01:30 - so for you figure that out once I
01:34 - figured out that I'm gonna be spending
01:35 - massive amounts of time coding what did
01:39 - I do
01:39 - become friends with somebody or I turn
01:43 - to my actual you know my friend at that
01:46 - time who it was a really good friend I
01:48 - turned him into like my coding friend so
01:50 - I got him on board into the coding world
01:53 - and then we both just would code like
01:55 - all the time so we were best friends and
01:58 - then we were coding at the same time so
01:59 - that way I got my coding time in and I
02:01 - got my friend time in so whenever you're
02:04 - trying to develop a new skills get
02:05 - friends around that skill set so then
02:08 - you're not missing out on friends time
02:09 - and then you're not missing out on the
02:11 - skill time that's the
02:13 - massive 10x way to increase your
02:14 - skillset become so immersed that even
02:17 - your friends are in that industry but
02:19 - let's say that you have a best friend
02:21 - that does completely something else and
02:23 - they won't change and you don't want
02:24 - them to change and that's totally fine
02:25 - too
02:25 - that's the point where you have to
02:27 - sacrifice a little bit so if you were
02:30 - gonna do a 16 hour a day you can't do
02:31 - that anymore do it and these are
02:34 - ridiculous examples I'm gonna make it
02:36 - more normal humanly respect your
02:38 - schedule as well so let's say you walk
02:40 - we were gonna study for one hour or like
02:42 - learn computer programming problem-solve
02:44 - or work on building an app or whatever
02:45 - for one hour then 40 minutes should go
02:50 - into let's say your app building or your
02:53 - project and then maybe 20 minutes you
02:55 - can spend with the friend or 50 minutes
02:58 - can go into working and then 10 minutes
02:59 - with a friend and that will slow you
03:03 - down but that's a good way to keep your
03:06 - whole life balanced because I think it's
03:07 - very good to spend time with your
03:09 - friends right spend time with your
03:11 - friends because you don't want to lose
03:13 - those just normal human things about
03:17 - yourself because people don't like the
03:20 - person who can't be friends with anybody
03:22 - else and to quantify it for you I've
03:25 - worked with developers who are
03:27 - incredibly skilled and I paid them next
03:31 - to nothing to work with them compared to
03:34 - some other developers who were ok but I
03:36 - paid a lot like I'm talking like 80 90
03:39 - dollars an hour or more some of them
03:42 - were actually hundred twenty dollars an
03:43 - hour it was their soft skills because
03:46 - they were able to charge so much not
03:48 - their technical skills so because you
03:51 - need you know people don't want to work
03:53 - with those people and that's just me
03:54 - quantifying it right but qualitatively
03:56 - looking at it subjectively you're just
03:59 - not a fun person to hang out with with
04:01 - from other people's perspective they
04:03 - don't want to spend time with you and
04:04 - that affects your relationships that
04:06 - affects your emotions and that affects
04:09 - your drive ultimately in the long run
04:11 - you need a way to kind of relax one good
04:14 - way is you can code work hard at the
04:16 - whole day and then at night you know go
04:18 - out with your friends and either go to a
04:20 - party or go out and eat something if you
04:23 - spend nighttime with your friends what
04:25 - I've seen a lot of
04:26 - when I wake up I'm really motivated to
04:28 - kind of get going for the next day so
04:31 - that's how I would answer that I'm gonna
04:33 - end this video keep it short because
04:34 - tomorrow's video is gonna be awesome
04:37 - is I took a lot of time to kind of build
04:40 - it I really hope you guys enjoy it watch
04:41 - it all the way through and yeah I'll see
04:44 - you in tomorrow's video I love you guys
04:46 - take care and I'll see you in the next
04:49 - video
