00:00 - hey what's up guys this is coffee from
00:02 - clever programmer Tom I want to just
00:06 - talk a little bit about my first day as
00:08 - a Python developer because I just
00:12 - thought about it right now I was walking
00:13 - with Frankia or d-roc and I was like we
00:17 - were having a conversation I thought
00:18 - about it and we thought it would be a
00:21 - cool experience to share someone to do
00:23 - that we're like let's roll the camera
00:26 - let's do it my first day at work was
00:29 - pretty freaking cool it I had to go
00:32 - through lots a long process for actually
00:35 - getting my first client and it actually
00:38 - happened from ad I posted on Craigslist
00:43 - and that ad was specifically an ad I
00:47 - posted for me presenting my services as
00:52 - a tutor alright me presenting my
00:55 - services as a Python tutor for I don't
01:00 - know 35 to 50 dollars an hour something
01:02 - like that what ended up happening was I
01:05 - got a call from somebody and they're
01:08 - like hey we're local to you and we just
01:12 - need somebody who can do this something
01:13 - of we heard this might need Python to
01:17 - fix it but we need a login system and we
01:19 - need the authentication system and we
01:21 - need this that and the other thing and
01:23 - at that time I was only about three
01:26 - months into my coding three to five
01:28 - months into my coatings
01:31 - skills coding experience you know I was
01:33 - kind of a beginner at that time and what
01:40 - I ended up doing was you know what
01:42 - normally any person who only had such
01:44 - little experience and has given such a
01:46 - giant task would do I said okay that's
01:53 - it all right
01:53 - I'll do it and that's when the craziest
01:57 - journey began and I didn't know anything
02:00 - about Python I didn't know anything
02:01 - about full stack development I didn't
02:03 - know anything about Django I didn't know
02:05 - about how databases work I don't know
02:07 - anything about how to negotiate pricing
02:09 - with a client I didn't know how to
02:11 - propose a contract I didn't know about
02:13 - NDA agreements I didn't know about how
02:15 - to present a timeline or do value-based
02:18 - pricing I mean I could just list all the
02:21 - million things I didn't know at this
02:22 - point I was like a beginner slash
02:24 - intermediate developer because I was
02:26 - just focusing on the technical skills
02:27 - but the one thing I did do was say yes
02:31 - and as a whole like crazy amount of
02:36 - things that we ended up going through I
02:37 - picked up tons of skills on my own
02:40 - because I knew I was under the gun to
02:43 - learn fast and I picked up insane amount
02:47 - of skills and really short amount of
02:48 - time
02:49 - got to my god to the interview the
02:55 - interview went really well and there
02:57 - were some negotiations there that went
02:59 - also really well too and I remember that
03:02 - I was super scared but I went and spoke
03:06 - with my mentor my mentor she told me
03:08 - charged him $100 an hour and so that was
03:12 - a really really scary call to make
03:15 - because they were already paying me they
03:17 - were willing to pay me $70 an hour and
03:19 - when I told my dad that I'm negotiating
03:21 - up to $100 an hour you got so mad when
03:25 - he was talking right over
03:27 - when I got home he was like.he he said
03:30 - it in Urdu and he just he said like he
03:35 - said something long he's like numb
03:36 - economies like Luger wouldn't have
03:38 - passed the idea to job me but usually
03:40 - geez consider out that basically what he
03:42 - was trying to get at was I'm getting
03:44 - paid enough for ready why am I asking
03:47 - them for more so you know my dad is a
03:49 - man about integrity and honor and he
03:52 - doing things the hard way
03:53 - so when he heard me being this
03:55 - privileged freaking American kid is like
03:57 - it's my first job dad but you know I I'm
04:00 - gonna [ __ ] go for it $100 an hour
04:03 - what he didn't realize was that I was
04:06 - for me like personally it was about
04:08 - preparing for really difficult
04:10 - situations and if I can handle the
04:12 - stress and pressure of getting my first
04:14 - job you know and be like this job
04:17 - everything depending on for example if I
04:19 - didn't get this job I won't be able to
04:21 - help my mom or my dad which was my
04:23 - initial goal I wouldn't be able to help
04:24 - myself and live a cool-ass life knows
04:26 - which was also a huge goal hang out with
04:29 - my friends have the car that I want be
04:31 - able to hang out with the girlfriend
04:33 - that I want like there are so many
04:34 - things that depended on this and
04:40 - so there was a lot of pressure internal
04:43 - and then I was going to college at that
04:44 - time you know I was going to Oakton
04:45 - Community College had to do great in
04:47 - college too and I don't have enough
04:48 - money to go to college but I still
04:53 - negotiated because principally speaking
04:55 - if I do the really really really
04:56 - difficult thing now then I can actually
05:01 - handle it when there are bigger moments
05:05 - where negotiation skills are required
05:06 - when the pressure is higher right so if
05:10 - you get used to a brutal amount of
05:13 - pressure earlier on and you practice it
05:17 - because the muscles confrontation
05:19 - negotiation it's a muscle once you get
05:21 - better at it you can do insane amount of
05:23 - things you can with stand a lot of
05:25 - pressure in life and that will determine
05:27 - the quality of your life as well I I
05:29 - firmly believe the amount of pressure
05:31 - you're willing to withstand that's
05:35 - exactly proportional to the success
05:38 - you're going to have in your life
05:41 - anyways I ended up getting this job at
05:44 - $100 an hour which is dope and the first
05:47 - day I went in I'll put some pictures of
05:49 - I'll try to find if I'll see if I can
05:52 - find the picture of me going in the car
05:54 - I have a picture of the first day at
05:56 - office and they actually set me up in
05:59 - their office they let me put my little
06:00 - coat on the chair
06:02 - they sent the IT guy to bring my - to
06:07 - get my monitor it's just so cool I mean
06:11 - how far the IT guy but it was really
06:14 - cool for me they respected me so much it
06:16 - was my first day you know the boss like
06:18 - asked me if I wanted water and it blew
06:20 - my mind that holy crap you know these
06:22 - people are doing such important jobs and
06:24 - now it's my first day and I'm I still
06:26 - felt like a kid and they're giving me so
06:28 - much respect and they're sending their
06:30 - full-time employees to like fetch things
06:32 - for me and so I was even feeling a
06:35 - little weirded out about that I didn't
06:37 - know how to think about it but that was
06:39 - a pretty dope part of it that they were
06:41 - giving me so much massive amounts of
06:42 - respect because I was kind of the only
06:44 - developer they had you know and didn't
06:46 - realize at the time
06:47 - so they they brought in to set up my
06:51 - monitor and I don't know if you can see
06:54 - some of the code on the screen but it's
06:56 - literally like some garbage flash code
06:59 - and I was literally going through McGill
07:02 - Greenberg's beginner Python flask
07:06 - tutorials
07:07 - while I was at this job so they were
07:11 - paying me for a skill that I didn't even
07:15 - have at that point but the skills that I
07:18 - did have is I was reliable my
07:20 - communication was awesome I always said
07:22 - yes and I showed up for everything so
07:25 - they're like okay let's give him a
07:26 - chance you know so I learned those
07:28 - skills on the fly like I learned how
07:30 - databases work I learn how flash words I
07:32 - learned like okay well that's a full
07:34 - stack developer what they do and I
07:36 - learned it's super fast cuz I was under
07:38 - the gun and it was exciting for me this
07:40 - is exciting then I realized Django might
07:44 - be a better framework for their job so I
07:46 - can work with my client in an easier way
07:48 - faster way of meet the deadlines but I
07:50 - mean if you even look at Django's
07:52 - homepage they called the framework they
07:55 - say Django it's for perfectionist with
07:58 - deadlines you know it's like beautiful
08:01 - and that's exactly what I ended up
08:03 - discovering the same stuff that I would
08:05 - spend forever building in nodejs or some
08:08 - other programming language or even
08:09 - freaking a flask in Python with Django I
08:14 - could build their login system and their
08:17 - authentication system and their
08:20 - invoicing app everything I could build
08:22 - it a lot faster Django comes with a lot
08:24 - of built-in tools and technologies and I
08:28 - realized that that's what you know when
08:30 - I was making their invoicing app and I
08:32 - was creating the front end meaning like
08:34 - the HTML CSS JavaScript the graphical
08:37 - stuff that you see you know they point
08:38 - click on if you go on Instagram calm
08:40 - right now all the stuff you can see and
08:41 - hover over and click that's all your
08:43 - front-end stuff but then when you
08:45 - actually hit a like and it says now in
08:47 - this picture has 232 likes that's being
08:50 - stored in a database somewhere so then
08:52 - when you come back it still says 232
08:54 - likes right it doesn't go back to 0
08:57 - it's not let it just forgets it
08:58 - remembers it somewhere that's what it
09:00 - means to have a database database is
09:02 - what allows you to save stuff okay
09:04 - database is like equivalent of having a
09:06 - memory card back in the day when people
09:08 - used to play games they needed a memory
09:10 - card you remember that database is like
09:12 - on your phone the place that allows you
09:15 - to store your stuff locally the database
09:17 - is just online so I had to learn all
09:21 - these things and yeah it was just a
09:24 - really fast and an experience and then
09:25 - two months of working with them I ended
09:28 - up getting a pretty awesome check of
09:31 - about I mean it wasn't just one checked
09:33 - I was invoicing them on a weekly basis
09:35 - I'll show you guys my invoice too right
09:37 - here and I ended up getting a twenty
09:39 - thousand dollar check from them which
09:40 - was super dope and this was while I was
09:44 - traveling while I went skydiving while I
09:49 - saw my nephew I mean I was still putting
09:51 - in work one of the times my mom was at
09:54 - the hospital so actually worked from the
09:55 - hospital which was super cool cuz like
09:57 - she would just go to bed and be sleep
09:59 - you know and be your heat in the heat in
10:02 - her healing process I'll just kick my
10:03 - feet up and I'll just be working from my
10:05 - laptop and just coding [ __ ] up and then
10:08 - getting paid for it and when she would
10:10 - wake up I could just focus on her and
10:12 - put the code stuff away so it's I wasn't
10:16 - realizing at this time at that time how
10:18 - amazing it was to be able to do that
10:20 - because to me it almost felt wrong it
10:23 - felt like I was playing a video game and
10:24 - I was getting paid for it literally felt
10:27 - like I was playing Street Fighter or
10:28 - Gears of War because you're creating
10:30 - stuff it's so fun and then somebody is
10:34 - paying you for what you wanted I'm like
10:38 - okay so this is the greatest job ever so
10:40 - I'm doing what I want I have my own
10:42 - client tip okay I had I was in-between
10:45 - that client and some other clients I had
10:49 - the ability to choose my own hours of
10:51 - when I work they didn't care when I work
10:53 - just care it as long as they got done
10:56 - and then eventually I even hired other
10:58 - developers who started doing work for me
11:00 - but that's a little bit more advanced so
11:03 - that whole journey of me getting my
11:04 - first job as a Python developer be
11:07 - learning how full stack worth and being
11:08 - able to do their job at that time then
11:11 - that led to me getting more class the
11:13 - first job was what changed everything
11:15 - for me you know that step-by-step
11:17 - process those exact skills of how I
11:19 - landed that freelance and client the
11:22 - exact technical skills I needed not more
11:24 - not less
11:25 - the exact amount technical skills I
11:27 - needed to land that client and deliver
11:30 - high quality work for them I still
11:31 - delivered really high quality work but
11:34 - what this allowed me to do is now waste
11:35 - any extra time learning any extra thing
11:38 - that I didn't need to learn it was the
11:41 - fastest path to the fastest learning and
11:44 - the fastest amount of income growth okay
11:46 - and that's the intersection you want to
11:48 - be at
11:50 - and that's why I'm like okay how can we
11:53 - make something like this which provides
11:56 - value to everyone in the community
11:58 - clever programmer I can my main goal is
12:01 - to provide something so it can provide
12:03 - value to who I used to be if it could
12:06 - just help to older me cross that path
12:08 - and I got together in my team we spent a
12:12 - few years and we built an incredible
12:14 - course which is designed to help you go
12:17 - through this exact same journey help you
12:20 - the teach you the full sack skills and
12:22 - the freelancing skills to be able to do
12:24 - what I did to hopefully be able to get
12:26 - the Paycheck that I got maybe less maybe
12:28 - more that is up to you
12:30 - the clients all that you know I can't
12:32 - control that but I just did the best I
12:34 - could to just go through my entire
12:35 - journey and just be able to help you
12:37 - repeat that process down to exactly what
12:40 - ad you should run down to exactly what
12:42 - your LinkedIn profile should look like
12:44 - down to exactly how to apply for these
12:47 - jobs down to exactly the specific skill
12:50 - you need to become a full stack
12:52 - developer I also teach you Django and
12:54 - Python the same tool that I use to
12:58 - complete their job I want to teach it to
13:00 - you I want to show you how to invoice
13:01 - people and charge the clients which are
13:03 - worse and be able to charge between
13:05 - thirty five or seventy five hundred
13:07 - fifty dollars an hour I don't want to
13:08 - say this is something you can do this is
13:10 - only something you can do if you put in
13:12 - a lot of hard work and follow up step by
13:14 - step system everybody's gonna make their
13:16 - own amount of money there's something
