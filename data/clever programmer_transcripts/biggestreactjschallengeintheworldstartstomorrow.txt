03:44 - our previous challenges we've had the
03:46 - javascript challenge if you maybe you've
03:48 - known
03:48 - we had two javascript challenges at this
03:50 - point and
03:51 - with that knowledge we provide for the
03:53 - students we've had people
03:55 - landing their first clients not kidding
03:57 - within a day to two days and
04:00 - actually starting to make money with the
04:01 - knowledge that we provide it's
04:03 - absolutely insane yeah we were getting
04:05 - people who were getting clients
04:07 - in literally day one day two of the
04:09 - challenge
04:10 - before anything else even
04:13 - so just this challenge in itself it just
04:17 - packs such a freaking punch oh yeah
04:20 - it's pretty ridiculous so that's why
04:23 - come prepare tomorrow to the react
04:26 - javascript challenge and again we're
04:27 - going to be going
04:28 - deep into your roadmap of becoming a
04:30 - react javascript developer which means
04:31 - you're going to learn things like
04:33 - what technologies do you need to learn
04:35 - to become a react.js developer
04:37 - how long do these technologies take and
04:40 - we're going to be talking about things

04:47 - how important is responsive design
04:50 - what is react.js what are the top
04:53 - companies using react.js
04:54 - and we're going to be talking about
04:55 - things like why an engineer and netflix
04:58 - makes
04:59 - 306 000 a year
05:03 - why is that happening it's insane
05:05 - powerful
05:06 - tech is what you're going to be learning
05:08 - and it's also what facebook is built off
05:11 - yeah and i would say it's also like the
05:12 - most important thing
05:13 - most important thing is this is real
05:16 - world
05:17 - knowledge okay this is not theory this
05:19 - is not theoretical
05:20 - this is real word applied knowledge you
05:22 - can later on apply

30:51 - um if you know node i think you should
30:53 - still learn react it's only going to

30:56 - think of reactors just like
30:57 - supercharging your javascript or node.js
30:59 - skills
31:00 - i mean it's really if your node you're
31:01 - using you know the end
31:03 - if you if you learn react then you learn
31:05 - the front end and so now
31:07 - what do you become you become a full
31:09 - stack developer
31:10 - and the value of a full stack developer
31:12 - is 10x
31:13 - yes aditya says guys you are amazing

35:09 - you guys have probably have seen us make
35:11 - the amazon clone but this is going to be

35:15 - have
35:16 - a back end and it's going to have the
35:19 - ability to accept
35:20 - credit card payments using stripe it's
35:23 - going to have
35:24 - server-less architecture which is the
35:27 - modern way
35:28 - to develop any app so then you're not
35:31 - making these monolithic apps
35:33 - you're making these extremely lean and
35:35 - mean
35:36 - applications that's how people at uber
35:39 - want you to develop or instacart want
35:41 - you to develop apps

42:03 - be able to hear everything
42:06 - all right let's bring this bad boy back
42:09 - are there any prerequisites of react
42:11 - as long as you know basic javascript or
42:13 - you've experienced
42:15 - even if you've experienced nothing
42:17 - that's gonna be fine we're gonna help
42:18 - you
42:19 - learn it people try to make it more
42:23 - complicated than it really is i remember
42:25 - one of my mentors i'm not gonna name him
42:27 - but
42:28 - when i wanted to learn it he would just
42:30 - always be like no no
42:32 - don't don't learn it give it give it a
42:34 - few
42:35 - give it a few years few years until you
42:38 - go through all these theoretical
42:39 - textbooks
42:41 - don't even start don't even start just
42:43 - gonna waste your time
42:44 - and i remember i used to listen to him
42:46 - on everything right so i thought okay
42:49 - he's right i probably shouldn't start i
42:52 - don't know what i'm getting into
42:53 - i'm just gonna be confused and i'm gonna
42:55 - be lost so i listen to him
42:58 - years and years and years passed by and
43:00 - guess what i just never touched react
43:02 - because i made it this thing that was
43:03 - going to be like the most complicated
43:05 - thing on the planet
43:06 - then i met sonny he was like hey you
43:09 - should learn react this is like awesome
43:10 - and it's fun
43:11 - and started picking it up with him and
43:14 - guess what in a week i had picked it up
43:17 - to the point where i was starting to
43:18 - build projects and things on my own
43:21 - and i just kept going with it nice thing
43:23 - you know guys this guy became addicted
43:25 - i waited the way cozy is when he learned
43:27 - something
43:28 - he was going to be addicted he they
43:30 - built like a analytics platform with
43:32 - react
43:33 - he built like uh some kind of a platform
43:36 - for videos
43:38 - it was crazy man yeah i just never
43:40 - stopped i just kept coding and
43:42 - react like for every day i was just like
43:44 - coding and react
43:46 - um i mean if you even look for zap if
43:48 - you look at stack overflow like react is
43:49 - like number one uh library for
43:51 - for you to go ahead to learn and need it
43:54 - right now
43:55 - it's very yeah very needed many people
43:57 - are looking for it
43:58 - and if you didn't know who made react
44:02 - you know did you know who made a
44:03 - reaction facebook facebook made react
44:05 - and facebook is not going on you
44:07 - anywhere so
44:09 - so there you go but yeah like what i was
44:11 - saying is
44:12 - i was so intimidated by learning react
44:15 - and then i picked it up and i was able
44:16 - to pick it up so fast now granted i had
44:18 - some experience in
44:19 - coding but guess what even if i didn't
44:22 - have any experience in coding
44:23 - and a lot of the people who are coming
44:25 - to our platform are beginners
44:27 - they're just learning and picking it up
44:28 - and building these projects and by
44:29 - building these projects
44:31 - they are learning people try to make it
44:34 - so complicated don't listen to them just
44:37 - don't listen to them trust me
44:38 - just yeah yeah it's actually funny like
44:41 - for me for example
44:42 - i didn't know react at all i knew
44:44 - javascript right yeah i didn't know the
44:46 - react but then i got
44:47 - a work it's actually funny i got
44:50 - a client right who wanted to react i
44:53 - told them like listen
44:54 - i don't know react right right they're
44:56 - like okay that's fine that's fine uh-huh
44:59 - i failed their test for react i got like
45:01 - zero percent
45:02 - right but then guess what they still
45:05 - still took me in
45:06 - yeah and then within a week or two i was
45:09 - building react applications non-stop
45:12 - like seriously bro i told the guys i'm
45:15 - like
45:15 - guys uh i literally i failed up i failed
45:18 - their test
45:19 - and they're like yeah you definitely

64:05 - this channel that's actually fantastic
64:07 - that's a really good idea
64:08 - willy rosa wonka says so we'll have more
64:11 - back-end features it means we are only
64:13 - going to care about the full front end
64:15 - with react
64:18 - we're gonna do both in this one willy
64:20 - we're gonna do front end with react
64:22 - and back end because on our youtube
64:25 - channel sometimes we don't have enough
64:26 - time to do back end so we mostly just do
64:28 - front end
64:29 - in this one we're gonna be going deep
64:32 - into adding back end functionality along
64:34 - with the front-end functionality so when
64:36 - you put this
64:37 - on your portfolio this app will be good
64:40 - to go
