00:09 - developer
00:10 - okay and specifically i have four
00:14 - things that i want to share with you

00:18 - giving up if you want to make that a
00:20 - reality for yourself
00:22 - otherwise you might be stuck in that
00:24 - place where you
00:26 - can't make progress in coding and you're
00:28 - stuck
00:29 - you can't build projects on your own and
00:32 - you're unable to get a job you're unable
00:35 - to
00:36 - get that interview and uh really you're
00:38 - not

02:56 - which ones of you feel like that right
02:57 - and this is where really you're just
02:59 - going in circles
03:01 - and watching content right you're
03:02 - watching one video here one video here
03:05 - learning something watching a tutorial
03:06 - here boom boom and you're just
03:08 - repeating yourself again and again and
03:10 - it's this cycle of death
03:12 - right we have a lot of people who are uh
03:15 - resonate this is resonating with i can
03:16 - see that in the chat
03:19 - uh tutorial rakshi that's what you mean
03:20 - by tutorial help what that basically
03:22 - means is you're watching
03:23 - tutorial after tutorial on javascript on
03:26 - python on
03:27 - you know c plus plus on react but you're
03:30 - not really making your own
03:32 - projects you're not really making your
03:34 - own um
03:35 - coding you know you're not solving your
03:37 - own problems
03:38 - and you're just kind of lulled into this
03:41 - false sense of you feeling like you're
03:43 - good you know i joke about this and i go
03:46 - i play chess a lot and whenever i watch
03:48 - the number one chess player in the world
03:49 - magnus carlson play
03:51 - i go man i can play just like that too
03:53 - when i'm watching him you know i'm like
03:54 - man
03:55 - now you know these moves look so simple
03:58 - it makes so much sense
03:59 - and then when i go to play those same
04:01 - moves guess what happens
04:04 - i get my butt handed to me
04:07 - i lose and i go wait i'm not magnus
04:10 - carlson
04:11 - okay cool let me keep working at this
04:14 - so this might happen to you where you're
04:15 - watching maybe me coding some other
04:17 - developer coding
04:18 - online on youtube and you go wow they
04:20 - make it look so easy
04:22 - i can do this this is so easy then you
04:24 - go and do it and it doesn't feel like
04:26 - that okay
04:28 - let me see here yep mario says
04:31 - i am in tutorial hell from udemy but
04:34 - it's because i don't know enough to
04:35 - build something with python
04:37 - can you tell me what do i need to do
04:40 - okay orion says yes i'm stuck at this
04:42 - hell mile says you're right qazi and uh
04:46 - we have another mario here hi nice to
04:48 - meet you
04:49 - because i'm watching it from udemy and
04:51 - it's because i don't know enough to
04:52 - build
04:53 - something with python all right and i
04:55 - love python
04:56 - and data science so let's just say you
04:58 - love python okay you could love
04:59 - javascript you could love whatever
05:02 - let's talk about why this is happening
05:04 - to you and why you feel like you're not
05:06 - making progress so let's go through
05:08 - mario's situation right now
05:10 - okay so let's go through mario's
05:12 - situation is there a way i can uh
05:15 - is there an easy way to cut all this
05:17 - boom boom boom boom
05:19 - boom okay so we have mario here
05:24 - okay and instead of just going in the
05:27 - straight line where he's making progress
05:31 - what's happening with mario right let's
05:33 - say he's a complete beginner right now
05:36 - i'm just gonna put a b or like let's
05:37 - just say level zero and he wants to get
05:39 - to level ten
05:40 - and he wants to make this progress
05:42 - happen well
05:43 - he's gonna be instead of going in this
05:46 - straight path
05:48 - what's happening with mario right now is
05:49 - going oh i'm gonna watch this tutorial
05:52 - then i'm gonna watch this one oh this is
05:54 - great
05:55 - boom this is good this is good this is
05:57 - good and when you connect all these dots
06:00 - it's basically this weird zigzag crap
06:04 - happening here okay and he's actually
06:07 - not making forward progress
06:09 - but it feels like progress so it's fun
06:11 - it feels great
06:13 - but it's he's really just connecting the
06:14 - dots in these really interesting ways
06:16 - okay and that's what we call tutorial
06:19 - hell
06:21 - now mario do you want to know
06:24 - how do you how you get out of that
06:27 - tutorial hell would you like to know
06:32 - that
06:38 - says this is interesting i want to
06:39 - address this and he says i got my first
06:41 - react dev internship because of your
06:43 - channel and building your projects quasi
06:46 - i've learned many things from your
06:47 - channel like approaching towards
06:49 - building projects thanks a lot a lot and
06:51 - the team
06:52 - you're very welcome and that makes me
06:53 - feel really really happy to hear that so
06:55 - thank you for sharing that that is
06:57 - huge let's give it up for
07:00 - uh anto in the chat guys yo
07:03 - let's go that is freaking awesome
07:08 - wow that is brilliant
07:11 - so going back to that right
07:16 - uh mark's point is if he wants to make
07:20 - that progress what he has to do is go
07:21 - through something that feels like no
07:23 - progress and feels like a lot of pain
07:25 - but he actually needs to code
07:28 - himself okay
07:32 - meaning that even if it feels painful
07:34 - for you right now
07:35 - that you actually need to code and you
07:38 - actually
07:39 - um question if any of you want to jump
07:43 - on the live with me
07:45 - i would love to do that but only if you
07:48 - post an
07:49 - uh intelligent uh question in here or a
07:53 - challenging question and if you post it
07:54 - in the chat
07:55 - below we'll bring you on the live with
07:57 - me okay
07:59 - so if any of you guys could maybe help
08:01 - do that that'd be amazing
08:02 - maybe get maybe get a message in
08:04 - community or something and then
08:06 - uh i can just send them the link for
08:09 - ecam like yes link
08:12 - and then they can jump on so i'd love to
08:14 - chat with you and see
08:16 - where you guys are stuck so then i can
08:17 - help out okay
08:24 - what to code a new pump says i'm working
08:27 - in android for five to six months and a
08:29 - bit on firebase what to do next for
08:31 - database and backend without firebase i
08:32 - don't actually know anything about
08:34 - backend please help
08:35 - so again watch our channel that's going
08:37 - to give you a lot of insight on back end
08:40 - okay cool
08:44 - so going back to that
08:50 - make sure that you are actually coding
08:53 - yourself
08:54 - that's going to be a very important
08:55 - thing and the problem with coding
08:58 - yourself
08:58 - is it feels like you're making no
09:00 - progress okay
09:01 - but what's happening is you're making
09:03 - this tiny bit of progress which is
09:05 - really hard to see
09:06 - because you're like man i'm not a 10 yet
09:08 - oh man i can't code like qazi yet or man
09:11 - i can't code like
09:12 - you know uh traversing media yet you
09:15 - know you some of you guys
09:16 - shout out to traversing media you guys
09:17 - might watch his content he has great
09:19 - content
09:19 - and you might be like man i can't code
09:21 - like that yet
09:23 - but really when you look at it you're
09:26 - making progress
09:27 - but it feels boring it feels like you're
09:29 - not going anywhere so one of the things
09:31 - i always say is
09:32 - how many hours are you doing coding
09:36 - not how many hours are you following a
09:38 - tutorial how many hours are you coding
09:41 - and that also means you looking up
09:43 - things online so how many hours are you
09:45 - coding and then googling answers to
09:47 - solve your problems to get in the way
09:48 - maybe you're like hey i'm gonna make a
09:50 - tic-tac-toe game today with python or
09:52 - maybe you're like hey i want to make
09:53 - something simple with python
09:54 - how many hours are you spending
09:56 - researching how many hours are you
09:58 - spending
09:58 - thinking about it maybe you can even
10:00 - have a coach that can like coach you and
10:03 - guide you along the way where they're
10:05 - letting you do most of the thinking
10:07 - so for example think about it like this
10:10 - okay
10:11 - when you go to the gym and you have a
10:12 - coach at the gym and this spot you or
10:14 - a friend at the gym and you can't lift
10:17 - that weight
10:18 - up and they just give you that little
10:20 - spot let me ask you this did they lift
10:22 - the entire weight for you
10:26 - no did they do everything for you
10:29 - no who did most of the work you
10:33 - they just came in and gave you that
10:35 - little extra push that's what you want
10:37 - to replicate
10:38 - in the world of software development and
10:40 - coding when you
10:41 - are just following a tutorial it's
10:43 - almost like thinking that you're getting
10:45 - if
10:45 - your coach lifts for you you're gonna
10:48 - get jacked
10:49 - that's not gonna happen okay so where
10:52 - it's gonna be the best is if your brain
10:54 - gets that time under tension which feels
10:56 - like a lot of pain
10:58 - so if you have a coach there working
10:59 - with you and i'd love to work with some
11:01 - of you guys online like maybe some of
11:02 - you guys are struggling
11:03 - and one of the things guys i would love
11:05 - to do is bring somebody on
11:07 - and maybe even work with them live on
11:08 - coding skills or just
11:10 - you know just connecting with you and
11:12 - seeing where i can help
11:14 - you
11:23 - okay karen asks hey
11:27 - you you say to practice and code but i'm
11:29 - always in a dilemma about what to code
11:32 - and what to practice so that's a great
11:36 - uh question so
11:40 - i think kiran think about like for
11:42 - example what type of apps do you like
11:45 - what what type of things do you like
11:46 - right so for example you might be
11:48 - you might think hey man let me go on to
11:52 - um let me let me pop this up
11:56 - okay here's what i recommend find
11:59 - inspiration somewhere so you might go
12:01 - hey
12:02 - let me actually go to dribble.com
12:06 - okay and uh look at inspirations here
12:08 - what should i code today
12:10 - so again some of this might be outside
12:11 - of your league as in it might be too
12:13 - difficult
12:14 - okay fine but find things you might be
12:16 - able to do
12:17 - okay so for example you could look up
12:19 - like beginner coding
12:21 - projects for javascript so let's
12:24 - actually look at this this is great
12:26 - all right and let's click on 17
12:29 - javascript projects for beginners to
12:31 - perfect your coding
12:35 - all right and now i would go from here
12:38 - vanilla javascript stopwatch
12:40 - so do we have an example of it all right
12:44 - try to code this yourself you might be
12:47 - like i can't code the whole thing
12:48 - okay okay okay okay fine fine fine but
12:52 - can you write the word stopwatch at the
12:54 - top
12:55 - can you do that can you write i think
12:58 - that would be cool even if i try to code
13:00 - these with you guys
13:01 - you know at some point it could be cool
13:04 - but can you write the word stopwatch at
13:06 - the top
13:07 - you know in your in your javascript app
13:10 - cool
13:11 - can you write the words vanilla
13:13 - javascript stopwatch
13:15 - cool can you write that zero zero colon
13:17 - zero zero cool
13:19 - can you make this button right there
13:21 - where it says start
13:23 - and maybe let me zoom in so you guys can
13:25 - see it more clearly
13:27 - okay now that button button start my
13:30 - what's the
13:30 - color why can't well how come i can see
13:33 - through that
13:34 - oh how do you make a see-through button
13:37 - color
13:38 - oh that might be called transparent
13:41 - right see-through button color okay
13:44 - let's go
13:45 - here see-through button color let's go
13:48 - right there
13:49 - and we we got transparent
13:54 - okay let's zoom in on to that boom
13:58 - all right there we go we got transparent
14:00 - right here that's the background color
14:02 - ah okay that's how i get this
14:05 - stop reset great you've made great
14:09 - progress so far
14:11 - now you might want to add functionality
14:13 - to it so when i hit start
14:14 - the second start counting oh how do i do
14:17 - that
14:18 - look that up right how do i change
14:22 - my page based on clicking a button
14:25 - oh there's something called javascript
14:27 - button events ooh
14:28 - there's something called event listeners
14:30 - what the heck is event listeners
14:32 - then study that then come back to your
14:35 - app and make that happen
14:36 - then go back to that tutorial and make
14:38 - that happen guys
14:39 - make your training specific
14:42 - if you want to get good let me put it
14:44 - like this
14:46 - if um if lebron james
14:53 - wants to get good at shooting three
14:56 - pointers
14:57 - let me guy let me give you guys um
14:59 - choices should he
15:00 - a be focusing on doing yoga slash
15:03 - meditating
15:06 - b um
15:09 - let's see b would be
15:16 - doing juggling on a unicycle
15:20 - okay and c
15:23 - practicing shooting
15:26 - hoops which one would help lebron james
15:31 - get better at shooting three pointers
15:36 - would it be a would it be b
15:39 - or would it be c which one
16:00 - love it
16:03 - okay so we're getting c c we're getting
16:06 - a bunch of people saying c
16:08 - cool so if that's c right
16:11 - then basically what that means is start
16:14 - shooting more all right for you
16:17 - what would that mean as a coder more uh
16:22 - coding okay and what i mean by this is
16:24 - it's called there's something called gpp
16:27 - right general performance something and
16:29 - then there's
16:30 - spp in in in training your physical body
16:33 - okay so i think that the best benefits
16:37 - that are going to come to you are going
16:38 - to be from
16:38 - specific training yes certain amount of
16:42 - general training will be good
16:44 - certain amount of meditation will help
16:46 - you certain amount of sleep will
16:47 - certainly help you
16:49 - but if you want to get better at
16:50 - shooting hoops you need to train in a
16:52 - specific way
16:53 - where you guys go wrong where you fall
16:56 - into tutorial hell
16:57 - is because you start run learning all
17:00 - kinds of general concepts without a
17:02 - very specific goal so
17:06 - your training should follow from your
17:09 - project
17:10 - so let's say mark was working on this
17:11 - stopwatch project he gets stuck on event
17:13 - listeners
17:14 - then or karen gets stuck on event
17:17 - listeners then karen goes
17:19 - on udemy or on youtube and then
17:22 - karen types in event listeners and
17:25 - watches that tutorial
17:26 - and as soon as he got his breakthrough
17:28 - from that tutorial he gets
17:30 - back and he coats that part in
17:34 - because if kieran doesn't do that he
17:36 - will never get better at coding
17:38 - does that make sense
17:41 - cool so that's why that's really really
17:44 - important okay so you want to have
17:45 - specific
17:46 - training the more specific it is the
17:49 - more benefit you're going to get out of
17:50 - it this is just true in all sports
17:52 - everywhere right and you should look at
17:54 - coding really like a sport
17:56 - it's no different than a sport so you
17:59 - know if you're
18:00 - training for olympic weightlifting if
18:02 - you're training for squatting if you're
18:04 - training if lance armstrong is take a
18:06 - training for a bicycling
18:08 - event if you're training for a triathlon
18:10 - or a marathon
18:11 - whatever it is how you're going to get
18:14 - your mile times down is by
18:15 - running more miles how you're going to
18:16 - get your swimming time down is by doing
18:19 - more laps
18:20 - so same thing here and then keep
18:23 - minimize the time between learning and
18:25 - coding and
18:25 - keep coding as much as you possibly can
18:28 - okay
18:30 - and pick beginner projects that you can
18:32 - do
18:33 - okay let me then work on this project ah
18:35 - next up i'm gonna work on a calculator
18:37 - okay then
18:38 - let me work on a drum kit all right so
18:40 - these are example
18:41 - projects for you to go through work on
18:44 - and add to
18:46 - um you know okay what's a palindrome how
18:49 - can i make a palindrome cool
18:51 - all right you can also go and look into
18:54 - like javascript algorithm problems
18:59 - let's go beginner algor uh beginner
19:02 - coding exercises okay so coding exercise
19:05 - is another great way to go
19:07 - and improve so let's go here boom you
19:10 - have
19:11 - javascript exercises this is another way
19:14 - for you to get
19:15 - a lot better at coding okay so
19:19 - javascript basic 150 exercises with the
19:22 - solution
19:22 - okay so what's the first exercise write
19:25 - a program to display the current day
19:27 - and time in the following format today
19:30 - is tuesday
19:31 - current time is 10 30 38 pm
19:34 - okay so how would you actually write
19:37 - that out
19:38 - you can go to the editor and they even
19:39 - allow you to code right here
19:41 - cool go right here and code
19:46 - but the more you practice more time
19:48 - spent here
19:50 - the better you will get but if you're
19:52 - spending just more time
19:53 - learning for the sake of learning you're
19:55 - going to have a lot of trouble
19:56 - right so for some of you you're
19:58 - struggling with functions
19:59 - right even some of you in our full stack
20:01 - mastery bootcamp you're struggling with
20:03 - functions and things like that so look
20:05 - that up hey how do i
20:06 - freaking improve you know how do i
20:08 - improve functions
20:09 - do more exercises that require you to
20:11 - use a function
20:12 - write a javascript function checks
20:14 - whether it's past string is a palindrome
20:15 - or not
20:16 - write a javascript function that
20:17 - generates all combinations of a string
20:20 - write a javascript function that returns
20:21 - a path string with letters in
20:23 - alphabetical order
20:26 - okay and start going through them oh how
20:28 - can i turn this
20:29 - phrase into the quick brown fox you
20:32 - might learn
20:33 - how to use the dot two uppercase and
20:35 - javascript oh cool
20:38 - i can do that great okay
20:44 - let's see
20:52 - how do you deal with self-doubt
20:57 - as a beginner love from switzerland that
21:00 - is an
21:01 - awesome question i'll actually address
21:03 - this in my bonus um i have four points
21:05 - for you guys four things i need you to
21:06 - give up
21:07 - but this is going to be a bonus fifth
21:09 - one that i'll share with you guys
21:10 - afterwards
21:14 - um okay so let's see sharing of the link
21:19 - let me see how i can do that
21:23 - copy
21:28 - hello
21:43 - okay cool so um
21:46 - yeah we're sharing a link meaning
21:48 - somebody might be able to jump on with
21:50 - us
21:56 - okay
22:12 - so yeah we're gonna have one person uh
22:16 - be able to jump on the live with me and
22:18 - have
22:18 - an interview and either maybe i might be
22:20 - able to put you in a coding hot seat
22:22 - so we're coding together or i might just
22:25 - have a conversation with you
22:27 - but we're only going to bring on one
22:29 - person so if you want to do that
22:31 - then look at the youtube chat and there
22:34 - might be a way for you to get into it
22:35 - okay so
22:36 - my team is going to be writing from the
22:38 - clever programmer
22:40 - channel so look out for what they're
22:42 - saying and follow those instructions
22:45 - but anyways that's really how you get
22:48 - past
22:49 - the tutorial health phase okay tutorial
22:51 - health phase
22:52 - you can overcome that by doing specific
22:54 - training
22:55 - all right and with that you can actually
22:57 - defeat this
22:58 - cool uh there's a lot more that i can
23:01 - get into in this but i think for now
23:03 - i'm gonna leave the tutorial held part
23:05 - of that hopefully
23:06 - you guys got a ton of value out of it
23:09 - okay
23:11 - so they just dropped um they're dropping
23:14 - the
23:14 - thing so if you send a message to that
23:17 - you're gonna be able to um
23:19 - yeah just text us at that number okay
23:21 - it's in the zoom chat
23:23 - or in the youtube chat my bad i'll write
23:26 - that number right here as well
23:30 - eight eight one seven that's it okay so
23:33 - that's the number
23:34 - uh shoot us a text here maybe hashtag
23:36 - interview or something like that
23:37 - right or hashtag um
23:40 - yeah hashtag yt interview uh that would
23:44 - tell me you're coming from youtube and
23:45 - you want to do an interview
23:46 - and then my team will be able to reach
23:48 - out to you and speak with you okay
23:50 - so go ahead and do that cool
23:53 - um number two okay this is the second
23:58 - thing i want to jump into so number two
24:00 - i'm going to talk about this is the next
24:01 - thing you have to give up
24:03 - all right so we're going to talk about
24:04 - this social media
24:06 - and i'll i will call this a dopamine
24:08 - detox okay
24:10 - a higher level term that's going to be
24:13 - dopamine detox
24:14 - all right so some of you might know uh
24:18 - what this
24:18 - means but i'm gonna get into it a little
24:20 - bit
24:22 - what is happening really when you're
24:23 - consuming all this content
24:25 - and you're watching all these tutorials
24:27 - and you're learning from other people
24:30 - and just consuming social media when
24:31 - your consumption is really high
24:33 - you're kind of like this drug addict and
24:35 - it happens to me too all the time
24:37 - and even um last week i had to go to
24:40 - portland with my team because i was
24:41 - performing so poorly
24:43 - that's why you guys didn't see me on
24:45 - youtube my mental game was
24:48 - absolute really really bad really awful
24:51 - okay and i was having trouble just going
24:55 - in a happy way i was like losing my
24:57 - happiness i was losing my focus
24:59 - i was watching chess until like 12 a.m
25:01 - or 1am every day
25:03 - um i was playing chess so much i mean i
25:06 - love chess but like it got too
25:07 - unhealthy amount and if it wasn't chest
25:09 - and i was watching like dragon's den or
25:11 - shark tank and just watching people
25:13 - pitch
25:14 - and i i just became this zombie
25:17 - oh damn i tried so hard to not curse
25:20 - okay i'll keep it going though just one
25:23 - um it doesn't count if it's just
25:27 - um so i became the zombie you know and
25:30 - my performance just went from like this
25:33 - epic performance to just like plateau
25:36 - like uh like freaking zombie you know
25:40 - i don't know if this happens to you guys
25:42 - um
25:44 - just reading the comments right
25:48 - and no no progress every day just
25:51 - plateaued
25:53 - and i was like why is that happening why
25:55 - am i experiencing that and feeling that
25:58 - and what i needed was i needed to
26:01 - actually
26:02 - go away from everything for a little bit
26:04 - so we went to portland with my team
26:07 - and i just had to have fresh
26:08 - perspectives i had to be alone by myself
26:11 - for a little bit too
26:12 - i did a lot of reading and one of the
26:14 - main things i did was like
26:15 - i got away from a lot of dopamine right
26:18 - so when you're consuming social media
26:20 - including when you're watching tutorials
26:21 - you're getting these dopamine hits
26:23 - these spikes and they make you feel
26:25 - really good
26:26 - when you're watching somebody code and
26:28 - do a tutorial you're feeling satisfied
26:30 - you feel happier like
26:31 - you feel like you did it you feel like
26:33 - you learned something
26:35 - and oftentimes it's good sometimes it
26:36 - can be a trap when it's a trap is when
26:40 - your performance against the amount
26:43 - you're learning
26:45 - is disproportionately more learning and
26:48 - a lot less your own
26:49 - improvement okay so let me say that
26:52 - again
26:53 - the only time it's dangerous is when
26:56 - your performance proportionally speaking
26:58 - towards your learning is
27:00 - way lower than the amount that you're
27:02 - learning something weird is happening
27:04 - there okay so let's say
27:05 - you're like learning and going crazy
27:08 - but then this other chart your
27:10 - performance is like going down
27:12 - right this is your learning and this is
27:14 - your performance
27:15 - something something is wrong and that's
27:18 - where tutorial hall
27:19 - is really tutorial hell okay
27:22 - but if your learning is increasing and
27:24 - your performance is increasing and this
27:25 - usually happens when your amount of
27:27 - action
27:28 - is more than the amount you're learning
27:30 - so for example
27:31 - 20 of you should be learning and then 80
27:35 - should be you applying that learning
27:37 - okay so you
27:38 - you're not doing passive learning
27:40 - anymore
27:41 - passive learning versus active learning
27:43 - okay you're doing active learning
27:45 - and this is really the key the key to
27:49 - getting better at coding and actually
27:50 - making real progress
27:54 - cool um i think when they come
27:58 - into the chat it'll tell me
28:08 - anto says um from your past videos i
28:11 - learned the importance of research
28:13 - reading docs looking for a library which
28:14 - does the work i need
28:16 - people need to know to speak about the
28:18 - importance of this quasi yeah so
28:20 - that research and that reading docs
28:23 - looking for a library that's really
28:24 - important but you just have to make sure
28:26 - you don't get into the passive learning
28:28 - mode of it you're doing the active
28:29 - learning of it meaning
28:30 - you're in your project and then you're
28:32 - reading the docs and then you're
28:33 - applying the things you learn from that
28:35 - doc
28:36 - and then you know you're going to github
28:39 - library getting the code that you need
28:40 - bringing it into your project and then
28:42 - just continuously making progress
28:45 - that's active so as long as you're
28:47 - active in that way
28:48 - that's really really good okay
28:52 - so with dopamine detox what i basically
28:55 - mean
28:56 - is reduce the amount you're consuming
28:58 - down to 20 or less
29:00 - so what does consumption look like when
29:02 - you're scrolling through on your
29:03 - instagram
29:05 - right so let me put this uh scrolling on
29:08 - ig
29:08 - that's consumption okay these are
29:10 - examples of consumption
29:13 - so that might not be adding value to
29:15 - your life
29:17 - okay let me move that here let me move
29:19 - this here so you guys can see it a
29:20 - little bit
29:21 - um okay uh what here's another example
29:25 - of
29:26 - consumption you have uh let's remove
29:29 - this comment so it's less distracting
29:33 - okay scrolling on youtube and just
29:35 - consuming everything consumption
29:38 - okay uh watching tutorials is
29:41 - consumption that can make you feel good
29:42 - and if you're not honest with yourself
29:44 - you're not gonna be making progress and
29:45 - you're gonna be doing a lot more
29:46 - learning
29:46 - than you are doing doing and at that
29:48 - point it is consumption and it is just
29:50 - giving you dopamine hits
29:53 - so what i urge you to do
29:56 - is actually go and challenge yourself
29:58 - and maybe just do a challenge for seven
30:00 - days right for the next seven days
30:03 - starting today
30:04 - can you go and
30:08 - drop your usage of consumption
30:11 - you know drop your usage of
30:15 - just taking in information from outside
30:17 - sources or at least in that brain dead
30:19 - space
30:20 - when you're reading a book you're very
30:22 - actively thinking about something and
30:24 - learning
30:24 - but a lot of this is eating up your time
30:27 - and when that happens you're not ever
30:30 - going to be in a state
30:31 - to want to do active learning you're
30:34 - going to continuously
30:35 - keep doing passive learning okay and we
30:38 - wanna we wanna pull you out of this this
30:40 - is really really bad
30:41 - this is dangerous this is where you're
30:43 - never gonna make any progress
30:52 - cool all right
30:56 - so that's kind of the thing that i
30:59 - wanted to say about this okay this is
31:00 - for you guys
31:01 - number two the dopamine detox okay let's
31:03 - get into number three
31:07 - this is the thing that if you want to
31:09 - get a job as a developer
31:10 - you have to give this up okay these
31:12 - aren't things i'm just telling you that
31:13 - are going to
31:14 - be helpful to you if you're serious
31:16 - about these goals
31:17 - this is just what you have to do don't
31:19 - do them and don't get goals
31:21 - don't do these things and don't get the
31:22 - results and then also don't be surprised
31:25 - for the work that you didn't do
31:26 - to not get the results that you wanted
31:30 - right so like don't let that surprise
31:32 - you
31:33 - um but if you want to achieve these
31:35 - results and you want to get these goals
31:37 - and you want to make it happen
31:38 - this is what you have to do otherwise
31:40 - you're going to be stuck
31:42 - exactly where you're at some of you
31:43 - might be happy being there and that's
31:45 - perfectly fine but for some of you you
31:48 - might want to
31:49 - you know and and why i make this content
31:51 - is for that one percent of you
31:53 - that want to actually make that
31:55 - improvement that will want to actually
31:56 - improve
31:57 - and keep like going to that next level
32:00 - every day
32:01 - okay let's go into number three and this
32:04 - is going to be the shiny
32:06 - i'm going to call it framework syndrome
32:09 - all right and what this applies to
32:13 - is you guys might have heard of shiny
32:15 - object syndrome and what this is is
32:17 - basically
32:19 - there's this weird thing that a lot of
32:22 - developers have
32:23 - including myself it happens to me too
32:27 - is you always want to keep learning
32:30 - either new languages or new frameworks
32:33 - and you kind of want to keep doing that
32:35 - all the time
32:39 - i'm going to learn python i'm gonna
32:43 - learn
32:43 - javascript
32:51 - okay cool so let me try this somebody
32:54 - actually wants to hop on so let's take a
32:56 - look if this is going to work or not
33:02 - yo jay how's it going
33:07 - um hold on i can't hear you for some
33:10 - reason
33:13 - huh
33:20 - why can't i hear jay it's interesting
33:24 - um
33:33 - jay is your mic on
33:37 - jay let me let me try speaking with you
33:39 - afterwards okay maybe we have to figure
33:41 - this out af
33:42 - you know after this call and then we can
33:43 - speak after
33:45 - okay my apologies i'm gonna have to
33:46 - cancel this call actually
33:49 - okay cool so let's go back to this right
33:53 - with shiny framework syndrome a lot of
33:55 - what is happening
33:56 - is you're going from one place to
33:58 - another place and you're learning
34:00 - different languages
34:01 - right so this might be you are picking
34:03 - up react
34:04 - you are picking up um
34:09 - uh redux okay you might be
34:13 - picking up a new language and you're
34:16 - like man i really want to learn
34:19 - you know um how to do headless ui
34:23 - or i want to learn tailwind ooh that's
34:25 - going to be really nice
34:28 - and you keep oh next js framework that
34:32 - is fun so
34:35 - this happens and what's really happening
34:37 - is you just start going in all these
34:39 - places
34:41 - but when it comes to your actual
34:43 - software developer skills and your
34:44 - actual fundamental skills
34:46 - they're not really making any progress
34:48 - so your actual skills are like kind of
34:50 - plateauing or just kind of growing very
34:52 - linearly
34:52 - and then they start growing growing
34:54 - slowly because in the start you were
34:56 - actually focused on just learning
34:58 - javascript or just learning that one
35:00 - thing
35:00 - and then maybe a little bit later why it
35:02 - starts to plateau
35:03 - is now you're just like in between five
35:07 - different frameworks and learning things
35:08 - so you're making very little progress in
35:10 - all those directions okay
35:12 - so i would say this can be a secret
35:16 - killer
35:17 - that's affecting a lot of your guys
35:19 - performance
35:20 - i would recommend to avoid this
35:23 - okay and the way that i would recommend
35:25 - to avoid this is go
35:26 - deep in one language go deep with one
35:30 - framework so for example if you pick
35:31 - react just go deep and start working
35:33 - with react building projects with react
35:36 - and use the css that you're given with
35:38 - the react or use the
35:39 - react css frameworks that it comes with
35:42 - right you could do bootstrap
35:43 - with the react you could do um you could
35:46 - do
35:46 - a material ui with react and a ton of
35:48 - other things
35:50 - use that instead of now starting to
35:52 - figure out how to add tailwind just
35:53 - because tailwind is
35:55 - hot okay but once you get good at react
35:59 - and you're skilled
36:00 - then it's okay to pick this up then it's
36:03 - not that bad
36:04 - but i think just constantly jumping and
36:07 - not making progress
36:08 - that's really where the problems come in
36:14 - cool
36:18 - all right
36:21 - greg greg says my big issue is impostor
36:24 - syndrome so
36:26 - something cool greg uh that i wanted to
36:29 - share with you
36:30 - is um i'm gonna be getting into imposter
36:34 - syndrome as well
36:35 - okay that's gonna be the bonus that i
36:37 - have for you guys
36:38 - and i'm going to be getting into that
36:40 - later i know somebody else brought this
36:42 - up too
36:42 - and i'm going to be talking about that
36:44 - last
36:46 - so i hope this makes sense to you guys
36:48 - shiny framework syndrome let me know if
36:50 - this is actually helpful to you
36:52 - and i think the simple way of avoiding
36:55 - it is to
36:56 - stick with the things that you enjoy and
36:58 - go deep with them and start working with
37:00 - those
37:01 - cool cool
37:06 - all right now let's get into number four
37:11 - and this is gonna sound weird but hear
37:13 - me out on this okay
37:14 - if you wanna get that dream job as a
37:17 - developer
37:18 - here's another thing you have to give up
37:26 - toxic relationships
37:31 - and this will lead me really nicely into
37:33 - my last bonus point where i'm going to
37:35 - be talking about imposter syndrome
37:38 - but guys um it affects a lot of us
37:41 - it's affecting a lot of you and this is
37:43 - a
37:44 - epidemic right this is this existed
37:47 - before the pandemic this is going to
37:48 - exist after this pandemic is over
37:51 - this is there and this will affect you
37:53 - in a lot of real
37:54 - really weird ways and so
37:57 - if you are in a relationship or you love
38:00 - somebody if their family or a partner or
38:02 - spouse
38:03 - it might be really hard to just cut that
38:05 - completely out of your life
38:07 - you know for some of you you might
38:09 - actually need to take a good look at
38:10 - that and go maybe this is bad for me
38:13 - okay and you know when i say toxic
38:15 - relationship it's really like people
38:18 - giving you negativity uh they're giving
38:21 - you
38:22 - uh they're bringing lots of drama
38:25 - okay um they
38:28 - like nothing is ever good enough
38:32 - for them right uh
38:35 - when when you leave after hanging out
38:38 - with them
38:39 - you feel like like crap
38:43 - right whether you're in an interaction
38:46 - or before an uh after interaction right
38:49 - you feel
38:50 - patronized with them when you're
38:51 - speaking with them you feel lower
38:53 - or you might feel inferior they might
38:55 - make you feel inferior
38:57 - right so if some of these if
39:00 - you feel any of these things i don't
39:02 - know who it is for you
39:03 - right for some of you it might be your
39:05 - parents for some of you it might be a
39:07 - friend for some of you it might be a
39:10 - partner
39:11 - and this is what you have to look into
39:14 - and what this basically means is either
39:15 - you
39:16 - give up them completely
39:19 - i'm gonna keep looking at the comments
39:21 - as well
39:23 - hey beck johansson is in the house
39:27 - welcome back nice having you here
39:31 - giving up give up all toxic
39:33 - relationships yes
39:34 - absolutely cool
39:38 - so you might either need to give that
39:41 - up or if it's really hard for you to be
39:43 - able to do that i mean you might just
39:45 - need to do that first of all so
39:47 - give that up okay otherwise you're
39:49 - going to be stuck there forever
39:51 - and nothing in life is worse than this
39:53 - because it will eat away at you
39:54 - permanently
39:56 - but in the case of parents and stuff
39:57 - like that you might not be able to just
39:59 - give that up for the rest of your life
40:00 - right you're bonded by blood
40:03 - so in that case what you might want to
40:05 - do
40:06 - is just reduce the time okay so it might
40:09 - not mean
40:10 - cut that relationship permanently it
40:12 - might mean
40:13 - okay look you're finding yourself
40:14 - spending five hours a week with that
40:16 - person
40:17 - can we do one hour or one and a half
40:20 - hour
40:21 - reduce the amount of time that you're in
40:23 - that energy
40:25 - okay so i think that will help you a lot
40:28 - and if you are a good influence then you
40:30 - might want to spend a lot of time with
40:31 - yourself
40:32 - okay and that's something else to look
40:34 - into as well how do you feel spending
40:35 - time with yourself
40:36 - how do you feel spending time coding by
40:39 - yourself alone
40:41 - you know because if you have trouble
40:42 - sitting alone and sitting by yourself
40:45 - and you can't enjoy your own company how
40:46 - are you going to become a good developer
40:48 - most of your life is going to be you
40:49 - sitting down and coding
40:51 - okay so something to look into but i
40:54 - think toxic relationships
40:56 - reduce them yo what's up miss ma'am
41:00 - let's go wait wrong time wrong sound
41:08 - all right i'll put this let's go
41:10 - hey
41:11 - [Music]
41:14 - ah thank you thank you so much for a
41:17 - whopping
41:19 - juicy delicious incredible
41:23 - ten dollar donation uh misk mem says
41:27 - sunglasses perpetually fall onto video
41:30 - game controllers proud face
41:32 - oh that's actually not what you said but
41:34 - you sent a sticker i imagine
41:37 - ah i'm just audibly reading what that
41:40 - sticker is
41:41 - that's funny but yeah thank you for that
41:43 - i really really appreciate it that means
41:44 - a lot
41:45 - i never expect anything from you guys
41:47 - but i do appreciate it thank you thank
41:49 - you so much
41:50 - uh today's coffee is on miss
41:53 - murn you're the man
41:57 - cool um by the way we should have like a
42:01 - membership section that could be really
42:02 - really cool
42:03 - because on youtube you have memberships
42:05 - and we could have like membership
42:07 - members we can bring them on lives and
42:09 - stuff like that
42:11 - you if you want to launch it you can
42:12 - launch it and i can have misc or
42:14 - somebody become a member and we can have
42:16 - like member chat
42:18 - yeah it might be an easy way to do it um
42:24 - i did send a sticker that's f yeah thank
42:26 - you man i really really appreciate
42:27 - that's cool
42:28 - uh so toxic relationships guys get them
42:31 - out of your life
42:32 - cut it or reduce it but make a decision
42:35 - about it
42:37 - now if you stay in it and you're just
42:39 - loathing like you're just
42:40 - simmering it in and you're just taking
42:42 - it all in and not doing anything about
42:45 - it well then unfortunately
42:46 - it's your fault right if you are not
42:50 - reducing the time that you could be
42:52 - reducing here
42:52 - then that's on you so there
42:56 - you might want to take some
42:57 - responsibility but i also understand
42:59 - that a lot of negativity can be really
43:02 - um you know really just screw you over
43:05 - so
43:05 - get rid of it reduce it
43:08 - and you will find you're going to be a
43:10 - lot happier i mean you're a lot happier
43:12 - coding becomes easier sitting by
43:14 - yourself and working on a problem and
43:16 - it's
43:16 - fascinating it's one of the most
43:17 - beautiful things you're like wow
43:19 - this is an amazing problem how am i
43:21 - going to solve this
43:23 - wow reduce with javascript works like
43:26 - this this is amazing
43:28 - javascript functional programming is one
43:30 - of the coolest things
43:31 - ever this is so cool right so those
43:33 - things could be great
43:34 - yo guys actually after this i would like
43:36 - to do like a speed run
43:37 - on free code camp or something for
43:39 - javascript that could be a lot of fun
43:41 - just like going through as fast as
43:42 - possible it could be fun
43:45 - um so cool
43:52 - yep
43:55 - awesome thank you yeah miss
43:58 - says um you guys had a free coding boot
44:00 - camp boot camp we owe you thank you man
44:02 - i appreciate that i appreciate that very
44:04 - very much
44:05 - um the reason why i had these here i was
44:07 - going to talk about this earlier but
44:08 - like
44:08 - go here look at designs
44:12 - and then when you get inspiration see if
44:13 - you guys want to work on this type of
44:15 - stuff too like this is important
44:17 - so go to places where you could get
44:18 - inspiration of what to work on so if you
44:20 - want to improve your frontend skills
44:22 - go and like look at this stuff and go oh
44:24 - what's cool about this
44:25 - let me work on the front end of this
44:27 - type of app okay if you're a back-end
44:29 - developer you might look at something
44:30 - like this and go um you know what
44:32 - maybe i'll work on the back end of an
44:33 - app like this great go do that
44:36 - do that with javascript
44:39 - okay um cool so let's get out of here
44:43 - right because all of this guys is
44:45 - javascript and stuff like that at the
44:47 - end of the day right like what happens
44:48 - when i click this
44:49 - meet button oh it gets added to some
44:52 - kind of
44:53 - cart okay so let's just say that right
44:56 - or
44:56 - what happens when i hit this watch video
44:58 - button maybe this video starts playing
45:00 - right here
45:01 - oh how do i make buttons work oh there
45:03 - might be a concept of something
45:05 - so when you're doing these functions
45:06 - here they're going to freaking
45:10 - work exactly hand to hand with what
45:12 - you're trying to do right
45:13 - here there's dom when you learn about
45:16 - dom and you learn how to manipulate dom
45:18 - now you're going to be able to do stuff
45:21 - like this okay it's very real world
45:24 - stuff
45:30 - cool
45:34 - awesome so uh
45:37 - let's go back here okay and
45:40 - we've talked about toxic relationships
45:42 - and the power of cutting out
45:44 - of them and one last thing i'm gonna hit
45:46 - on
45:48 - is impostor syndrome okay
45:51 - and this is something that every
45:53 - developer experiences
45:55 - maybe you experienced it as well if you
45:57 - do you know
45:58 - again let me know i'd love to hear from
46:00 - you but this is essentially like you
46:02 - feeling like you're
46:03 - um you know how how do we let's look up
46:06 - an actual definition of it right like
46:08 - let's look that up
46:08 - imposter syndrome
46:13 - and the technical definition might mean
46:16 - loosely defined as
46:22 - doubting your abilities and feeling like
46:24 - a fraud
46:26 - okay it disproportionately affects high
46:29 - achieving people who find it difficult
46:31 - to accept their accomplishments
46:32 - many question whether they're deserving
46:35 - of accolades
46:37 - all right doubting your abilities and
46:40 - feeling like a
46:41 - fraud so let's go back
46:44 - and we'll go here and paste that okay
46:50 - that's really what it is if any of you
46:53 - feel that
46:54 - raise your hands proverbially raise your
46:57 - hands
46:59 - in the chat
47:10 - so something important right i'm looking
47:13 - in the comments michael says
47:16 - that's me awesome for being able to
47:18 - admit that michael
47:20 - very powerful to be able to do that very
47:22 - very powerful
47:28 - tuna no crust says don't worry guys you
47:30 - get used to the imposter syndrome
47:32 - never goes away but it gets better okay
47:35 - thank you for sharing that
47:37 - tuna says also raises his hand and says
47:40 - he feels similarly
47:41 - with imposter syndrome jatendra raises
47:45 - his hand and says i feel similar
47:48 - greg raises his hands
47:51 - okay and greg if you feel the imposter
47:54 - syndrome
47:56 - i would love to jump on a video call
47:59 - with you if you would like
48:00 - okay so uh if you want you can text
48:02 - there you don't have to okay it's
48:04 - totally cool
48:05 - but if you send a text message at that
48:06 - number uh we could bring you on this
48:09 - live i'd love to kind of
48:11 - have a conversation with some of you
48:12 - guys and kind of get into it
48:17 - cool greg yep raising his hands me me
48:19 - canal says me
48:22 - yep yup yup
48:25 - uh tuna no crust actually interestingly
48:27 - enough says i'm a senior software
48:29 - developer and it still gets me
48:31 - you're tuna i would love to have you on
48:33 - the platform as well
48:34 - okay so do me a favor send a message
48:37 - there and let's
48:38 - see if we can bring you on
48:42 - that's awesome julia says i feel like i
48:45 - could never
48:46 - catch up even when i start at the
48:49 - beginning
48:54 - yep so
48:57 - it's a really powerful
49:00 - thing and actually a lot of us um
49:05 - let me see i'll bring this bring this
49:07 - down here so you guys can see that
49:09 - okay so it seems like a lot of us feel
49:12 - that
49:12 - right a lot of people are raising their
49:14 - hands a lot of people are saying i feel
49:16 - that
49:17 - and serum just said me so
49:21 - it's funny with coding with things like
49:23 - coding and things like intellectual
49:25 - things
49:25 - because they're so intangible you'll
49:28 - often feel that for a really long
49:30 - time for me it never it's quite it's
49:33 - quieter but it's always there with a
49:36 - bunch of things
49:37 - like especially with coding it's there
49:38 - it's like oh these people on stack
49:40 - overflow know everything what do i know
49:42 - but then like i'm coding up crazy
49:45 - but then i'm still like
49:46 - in my mind doubting myself so one other
49:48 - thing that tuna crust says there's a lot
49:50 - of power to that and he goes yo
49:52 - you might actually feel that forever but
49:55 - the idea is either
49:57 - you keep working through it every single
49:59 - day and it might start getting quieter
50:00 - to the point where you can't hear it
50:02 - anymore
50:03 - and really what's happening is you're
50:05 - building proof
50:06 - for your brain right so for example your
50:09 - brain is like gravity is a thing
50:12 - what's the proof if i take this wallet
50:17 - and i drop it proof
50:20 - right if i take this thing and drop it
50:23 - more proof
50:24 - if i take my phone drop it proof
50:28 - proof proof proof proof proof proof
50:30 - eventually the
50:31 - proof the evidence becomes so
50:33 - overwhelming that your brain is like
50:35 - okay maybe i know what the hell i'm
50:37 - doing right so
50:38 - the times where you feel less least like
50:41 - a fraud
50:41 - is the time you're most into it and
50:44 - working at something you're like man i
50:45 - feel great
50:46 - okay so this is one of the things that's
50:48 - very debilitating for a lot of
50:50 - developers
50:51 - but one thing that can help you is like
50:52 - you don't have to
50:55 - one thing i can say that can help you is
50:56 - like no you're not alone
51:00 - we all feel it we all feel it
51:04 - okay and sometimes it might go away for
51:08 - you and i think that would be so great
51:10 - and that would be like such an amazing
51:11 - feeling
51:12 - and there will be times you feel it but
51:13 - then there will be times that it's there
51:16 - but the the difference between the
51:18 - people who make it to the top in the
51:20 - developer game versus who those who
51:21 - don't
51:24 - how you let it affect you
51:27 - if you let it affect you to the point
51:29 - where it's debilitating
51:32 - you're gonna get into this okay like for
51:34 - example
51:36 - if um does anybody know what's the best
51:38 - way to starve fear
51:40 - does anybody know what is nutrition for
51:43 - fear
51:47 - okay um
51:51 - um so nutrition for fear
51:55 - uh thank you for another donation really
51:57 - really appreciate it
51:58 - thank you okay is is time
52:03 - if you give fear time it keeps growing
52:05 - right so if i
52:06 - draw fear fear will keep growing like
52:08 - this
52:10 - okay on the x-axis i have time
52:13 - and the y can be fear
52:17 - okay so fear keeps growing over time how
52:20 - do you starve fear
52:21 - take away time
52:25 - boom dead okay just face the freaking
52:28 - thing
52:29 - so if you're feeling like a fraud go in
52:32 - code
52:32 - go and learn about coding do more coding
52:35 - make projects
52:37 - it starts to go away it starts to
52:38 - evaporate every single freaking time
52:41 - the more you linger on it the more you
52:43 - let it last it will keep
52:44 - growing more and more and more as time
52:47 - progresses so what you want to do
52:48 - is you don't want to let it become this
52:50 - big giant monster over time
52:55 - it's called screen brush by the way yeah
52:57 - thank you thank you thank you somebody
52:58 - drop that in the comment
53:06 - ah interesting
53:10 - so we have some comments coming in
53:11 - sheriff says was messing with the
53:12 - official react repo
53:14 - reading the code and i felt like a
53:16 - freaking imposter in javascript world
53:18 - so think about that react is built by
53:21 - facebook
53:21 - facebook has been coding for like 15 to
53:23 - 20 years they have hundreds of thousands
53:25 - of developers on their team
53:27 - who collectively have like hundreds of
53:30 - thousands of years of experience and
53:32 - development and time in all of this
53:34 - right
53:36 - and you're getting the best of the best
53:39 - of the biggest breakthroughs of probably
53:41 - freaking
53:42 - hundreds of thousands of people working
53:43 - on this repo and building it to what it
53:45 - is today
53:47 - and you're getting that final finished
53:50 - piece
53:51 - and then you're reading then you go oh
53:52 - it doesn't make that much
53:54 - sense to me of course it's not making
53:56 - that much sense it's not supposed to
53:58 - make sense to you
53:59 - it's there if they can simplify it to
54:02 - those levels
54:03 - great but think about it it's almost
54:06 - like
54:08 - it's funny the way that i'm going to say
54:10 - this because that's how my brain thinks
54:11 - my brain is like sure of how dare you
54:14 - think that it would make sense to you
54:16 - it's like almost like what you might
54:18 - you're the audacity
54:20 - that you have to think me i'm like it's
54:24 - not supposed to make sense to me you
54:26 - know i haven't spent that much time like
54:28 - if you have e equals mc squared yes you
54:30 - can say it and you can repeat it and you
54:32 - can regurgitate what you might have
54:34 - learned in your physics class
54:35 - but like we could spend the rest of our
54:37 - lives die
54:38 - be reborn then die again then be reborn
54:41 - again and
54:42 - we might not get it at the deep level
54:44 - understanding or the internalization
54:46 - that like einstein experienced and had
54:48 - when he understood when he understands
54:50 - that as a concept
54:53 - some of this stuff is hard so almost
54:56 - come one thing that helps is how you set
54:58 - your expectations if you set your
54:59 - expectations
55:00 - i'm supposed to understand this i'm
55:01 - supposed to have gotten this by now
55:03 - that's where imposter syndrome comes in
55:05 - a lot okay
55:06 - so for me when i'm doing a lot of this
55:08 - stuff
55:09 - i don't let that get to me i'm like i'm
55:12 - not supposed to get it
55:13 - i'm supposed to you know but i'm like
55:15 - working at it
55:16 - so when i don't get it or perfectly
55:19 - clicks i'm not that hard on myself
55:22 - i'm a lot more relaxed right and then
55:24 - i'm like oh cool like
55:25 - i'm just going to get through this cool
55:26 - i'll figure this out i'll figure this
55:28 - out too
55:28 - it's like the world is a playground you
55:30 - know i'm just playing everywhere
55:33 - let's go like whoa that's crazy here's
55:36 - another concept i don't get it but cool
55:38 - i'll get it tomorrow probably i still
55:39 - didn't get it oh let's try it again next
55:41 - week
55:43 - so keep going and i keep going and i
55:45 - keep going and i keep going and i keep
55:46 - going and then at some point it clicks
55:48 - things click and i'm like
55:49 - whoa whoa that's what this is
55:52 - that's what they were saying the react
55:54 - repo oh my god like four years later
55:56 - unit clicks and it makes sense
55:58 - but i think just being hard on yourself
56:00 - is what leads you to expect that you
56:02 - should know this right now
56:04 - which then starts putting in this weird
56:06 - cycle
56:07 - which is like i should know this by now
56:08 - i don't know this by now now if i don't
56:10 - know this is my friend know that i don't
56:12 - know this am i gonna get caught oh i
56:13 - shouldn't tell anybody that i don't know
56:15 - this
56:16 - and then it's this weird world that you
56:18 - might become a part of
56:21 - all right so um i think those are some
56:25 - of my thoughts that i want to share with
56:26 - you
56:28 - um this
56:31 - so sure of like basically what i'm
56:33 - saying is it's
56:34 - it's okay for you to experience that
56:37 - but more importantly for you to know
56:38 - that it's okay and then it's natural for
56:41 - you to not
56:42 - fully grasp everything in the react you
56:44 - know docs
56:54 - the real fat boy says that's a real tedx
56:56 - talk
56:57 - let's go
57:00 - the goal is to do those one day that'll
57:02 - be super exciting
57:06 - yeah you don't know everything by
57:08 - default you should assume
57:10 - that you likely don't know you'll learn
57:12 - like think about it like this elon musk
57:14 - is
57:14 - you know um most of us can agree that
57:18 - he's a very intelligent incapable human
57:20 - being right he's very intelligent
57:22 - but when he walks in the thing that most
57:24 - people say about him is that he
57:26 - asks the most amount of questions in the
57:28 - room
57:29 - he's one of the most curious people so
57:32 - if he's learning
57:34 - so should you be okay the default
57:38 - in your mind the expectation is i'm not
57:40 - going to like
57:41 - you know i'll learn this but i don't
57:43 - think i should like freaking understand
57:45 - this
57:46 - but if i do that's great play to
57:48 - understand it
57:49 - but remove the expectation okay
57:53 - uh that's really really um
57:56 - that's really key for me that freed me
57:59 - up a lot like my parents would be like
58:01 - you have to get an a for me it was like
58:04 - well
58:05 - now that i have to get an a with an
58:07 - expectation and the most i can do is get
58:09 - an a
58:10 - and if i get an a all they're gonna say
58:11 - to me is you did a good job
58:13 - or all they're gonna say to me is like
58:14 - oh that's cool like
58:16 - you know now we're not gonna now
58:19 - you know basically like it's expected to
58:22 - get an a then
58:23 - that for me wasn't exciting i'm like
58:24 - screw this i'm just gonna get f's
58:27 - that's pretty stupid right but that's
58:28 - how it worked in my brain
58:30 - but if my parents were like if you get
58:33 - any grade that'd be amazing
58:34 - it makes me want to then get an a so
58:37 - when i remove the expectation i'm very
58:39 - happy and i operate at very high levels
58:41 - when i have the expectation it takes a
58:43 - joy of life away from me
58:44 - it's not that i don't perform under that
58:47 - is that it takes the joy away
58:49 - and when it takes the joy away i'm very
58:51 - less likely to continue doing it so when
58:53 - you think about coding
58:54 - how are you going to become a great
58:55 - coder i need to be doing this for a
58:56 - prolonged period of time
58:58 - how do i do this for a prolonged period
58:59 - of time to make it enjoyable
59:03 - right then when i go to the react docs
59:06 - and they're not enjoyable uh then
59:09 - i'm not gonna continue doing this and
59:11 - i'm gonna start hitting it i'm gonna
59:12 - start developing anxiety around coding
59:14 - and then i'm gonna probably quit coding
59:16 - in like three to five years
59:17 - and if you do that you'll never become
59:18 - like one of the best
59:21 - however if you switch up the game and
59:24 - you go
59:24 - how can i do this in a way where i enjoy
59:27 - this and it's going to be really really
59:28 - fun
59:31 - then play the game that way i'm not
59:33 - supposed to get the react docs it's
59:35 - of course i'm not gonna get it oh i got
59:37 - it i got
59:38 - one percent of it yo that's exciting
59:41 - that makes you wanna
59:41 - read more and understand more doesn't it
59:44 - so play the game
59:46 - where it's fun because if it's fun
59:48 - you're going to do it for a long term if
59:49 - you do it for a long time you're going
59:51 - to get you're going to beat everybody
59:52 - else
59:53 - that's just how it works
60:05 - coding with kenny says because being a
60:06 - jack of all trades
60:09 - is um is the it's not the most efficient
60:12 - way to success instead master one
60:14 - concept at a time and it'll be much more
60:16 - effective
60:17 - yes
60:24 - yes scene says thanks man but it feels
60:26 - impossible to master
60:28 - vanilla js yeah vanilla javascript is
60:31 - like a bajillion things you're never
60:33 - really going to master it nobody has
60:36 - uh there's so many weird rabbit holes
60:38 - you could go down
60:40 - like you could go down a rabbit hole of
60:41 - bits and bites and spend the next 30
60:43 - years on that and then write a research
60:45 - paper and then die
60:46 - and that's that's all you accomplished
60:48 - right like
60:49 - that's the crazy thing about this world
60:52 - like there's
60:53 - you could go so deep into things that
60:55 - you could go crazy into them right
60:57 - just like understanding logic gates oh
60:59 - how do the logic gates work or
61:02 - like you're gonna go crazy so the point
61:04 - is not to do that
61:05 - what's your goal like it's your goal to
61:08 - master
61:08 - vanilla javascript then that's a maybe
61:12 - if that's your goal in life okay cool
61:13 - then like start pursuing it
61:15 - but also understand you might need like
61:18 - you know 20 lifetimes to be able to do
61:20 - that plus like the powers
61:22 - and skills of a quantum computer and a
61:24 - super computer
61:25 - installed into your brain so understand
61:28 - that how hard that goal is then you're
61:29 - setting yourself
61:30 - up to be disappointed right that's what
61:33 - you might be doing here you might be
61:35 - setting yourself up to be disappointed
61:36 - and then you're disappointed and then
61:38 - you're like i don't know why i'm
61:38 - disappointed
61:39 - then you're even more upset at yourself
61:41 - and then it's just bad then you're just
61:43 - unhappy then you're depressed
61:44 - then you come to code with a shitty
61:46 - energy and then you're not learning
61:48 - anything
61:49 - so it gets worse and worse right but if
61:52 - you set a goal like
61:53 - i'm going to use javascript or even for
61:55 - getting javascript i want to actually
61:57 - build this app because i think it could
61:58 - help people
62:00 - i'm going to build this website for this
62:02 - restaurant i think it's going to help
62:03 - them
62:04 - i want to build a new type of social
62:06 - networking app
62:09 - then you work on that and then these are
62:11 - just tools to help you get there
62:13 - okay javascript is just a tool then
62:15 - you're not sitting there like i want to
62:17 - master
62:18 - vanilla js that's like a crazy
62:22 - hard goal to achieve right
62:29 - um tuna no chris says co coding with
62:33 - kenny is correct
62:34 - best to take bite size chews when you're
62:35 - just starting out and focus your efforts
62:38 - in a couple things until you're
62:39 - proficient then move on to the next
62:41 - absolutely uh now guys
62:44 - one huge thing i do want to say is um

66:26 - javascript web scraping
66:28 - making front-end apps back-end apps full
66:31 - stack development all of this stuff

67:23 - you know if you're in the chat i'm just
67:25 - going through the chat right now
67:28 - cool took me three and a half years to
67:31 - get over 100k it's definitely
67:33 - oh by the way that's really freaking
67:34 - awesome tuna no crust is making over a
67:36 - hundred thousand dollars a year
67:37 - that's fantastic and it took him three
67:39 - and a half years to do that
67:41 - definitely doable goal so that's a
67:44 - really good
67:45 - freaking accomplishment by the way but
67:47 - for those of you guys
67:49 - yeah some of you guys won't be able to
67:50 - make it i understand i know you guys are
67:52 - in a different country i know somebody
67:53 - said they're in nigeria that's going to
67:55 - be difficult
67:57 - um but if any of you guys are in us
68:01 - i would love to have you you know come
68:04 - come here to this event if you are able
68:06 - to come here
68:07 - do let me know in the youtube chat
68:09 - that'd be great
68:10 - but go here reserve your spot and i
68:13 - would love to have you guys here okay
68:15 - don't miss out on this it's going to be
68:16 - a life-changing experience
68:18 - this is going to be epic we're going to
68:19 - start doing more of these as time
68:21 - progresses
68:22 - but this is gonna be the first one and
68:25 - probably one of the best ones we're
68:26 - gonna do
68:27 - okay so definitely show up there
68:30 - uh with that said let me go
68:33 - and see
68:37 - i have been a developer for six years
68:40 - oh son
68:43 - tuna no crush just said i've been a
68:45 - developer for six years currently make
68:47 - two hundred and eight thousand dollars
68:48 - in the midwest
68:50 - that is epic that is epic really really
68:54 - solid work
68:55 - and this goes to show a lot of people
68:58 - that not only can you break through a
69:00 - six-figure salary as a developer but you
69:02 - can
69:02 - also start going to multiple six figures
69:06 - as a developer as well okay and tuna no
69:09 - cross what types of languages are you
69:11 - using like what frameworks are you using
69:12 - on a daily basis are you doing front end
69:14 - backend data science
69:16 - python javascript what are you doing i'd
69:18 - like to know more about that too
69:19 - and i think it brings value to everybody
69:21 - who's here
69:42 - uh it's different for me because i went
69:44 - in independent and incorporated got it
69:47 - yup that can help too if you're going
69:49 - fully independent and doing it you can
69:50 - then set your own rates
69:52 - and things like that but you also get
69:54 - more risk involved as well just because
69:56 - there's not that much job guarantee but
69:59 - if you
70:00 - are if you can handle that risk and
70:02 - you're tolerant enough to do that then
70:03 - it might actually be a great option for
70:05 - you
70:13 - awesome so this has been um
70:16 - really good if you guys have questions
70:18 - i'd love to take some of your guys's
70:20 - questions right now i'm scanning for
70:22 - them
70:22 - but if you guys don't have that many
70:24 - questions then i'm gonna start wrapping
70:25 - it up
70:26 - okay so i'm gonna stay on here for
70:27 - another like 30 seconds to a minute
70:29 - if you guys have questions you want to
70:31 - put them um
70:32 - down in the chat i'd love to bring them
70:35 - up and address them for you guys
70:39 - yeah i know noman it's been a while but
70:41 - i want to start doing these lives again
70:43 - this is actually really
70:44 - fun and i miss this aspect of connecting
70:46 - with people
70:47 - and i'd love to even start bringing you
70:48 - guys on the show now
70:50 - um and i think that'd be even more fun
70:54 - we should build like we should start
70:56 - building some kind of community where
70:57 - you can start bringing
70:58 - them on that'd be sick like a slack
70:59 - channel on the side and then
71:01 - you can be talking to them you know yeah
71:05 - or discord his favorite
71:18 - age may be a hurdle for developers
71:25 - i am unlucky because there is no scope
71:28 - of coding in my country
71:30 - um
71:35 - so
71:39 - coding is worldwide you can be in any
71:42 - country in the world
71:44 - and you can be coding for a german
71:46 - market you could be coding for
71:48 - a u.s market you could be coding for
71:51 - canadian markets like it doesn't matter
71:53 - you can be coding
71:55 - for anyone anywhere you are unlucky
71:58 - because your brain has given into the
72:00 - fact
72:01 - that it should make you believe that
72:02 - you're unlucky so
72:05 - that's unlucky part about this because i
72:07 - won't be able to change your mind if you
72:09 - have a belief that you're on
72:10 - like if you have this belief you're
72:12 - screwed for the rest of your life
72:14 - like that sucks and that will be like a
72:18 - very
72:18 - painful like the rest of your life will
72:20 - be very painful
72:22 - so
72:25 - what i would share with you what i would
72:29 - tell you is the most dangerous thing i
72:32 - hear in that sentence is that it starts
72:33 - with i am
72:34 - unlucky and it doesn't matter what
72:38 - thing that you put there you're screwed
72:40 - you're never gonna make it
72:42 - regardless of what you're doing okay so
72:45 - if you can figure out how you can take
72:47 - that away and start to see
72:49 - then you start to empower yourself
72:51 - because right now you're not in power
72:53 - everybody else is in power i am unlucky
72:56 - because of this
72:57 - i can't do this because of this great
73:00 - then that means the other person has a
73:01 - power they'll have a great life they'll
73:03 - do all the things they want to do
73:05 - you will be in the corner crying
73:09 - complaining that you're unlucky
73:13 - so what i would recommend is figure out
73:15 - how to not feel like you're unlucky
73:18 - okay and uh one way to start that is to
73:21 - just stop
73:22 - using sentences like that and to stop
73:24 - saying it that would be the first place
73:26 - i'd start
73:26 - okay next place is i'd look hey what can
73:29 - i do
73:30 - okay because what can't you do is a very
73:33 - different question that what
73:34 - can i do okay um
73:37 - your brain will be well brain will
73:40 - surprise like if i ask my brain what
73:42 - can't i do i'll be like i can't sing
73:44 - um what else i can't be a great rapper
73:47 - here are some other
73:48 - really really good ones i'll like never
73:50 - be lebron james i'll never be a great
73:52 - basketball player
73:53 - oh man i'm on fire right now i'll never
73:55 - be elon musk probably jeff bezos not
73:57 - really i'll never have great e-commerce
73:58 - business like
73:59 - whoo right whereas you ask your brain
74:03 - the other question what
74:04 - can i do and all of a sudden becomes
74:06 - great well i can have a great youtube
74:08 - channel i could have the best youtube
74:09 - channel on
74:10 - coding on planet earth i got the best
74:12 - youtube channel on how to create a
74:14 - youtube channel on planet earth
74:16 - i could be working and helping
74:17 - transforming so many people's lives
74:19 - uh and then things change okay so for
74:22 - example
74:24 - um yeah that's what i would share with
74:26 - you okay so you know
74:29 - that's a difficult place to be at i
74:31 - definitely have empathy
74:32 - when you're in that place you can't see
74:34 - your way out of there
74:36 - so that's the dangerous thing my goal is
74:38 - to
74:39 - jolt you across the screen and shake you
74:43 - because i'm only going to get this one
74:45 - shot to really help you
74:47 - beast um so my goal is just to shake you
74:50 - and yank you
74:52 - in the one minute three minute
74:54 - conversation i can have you do which is
74:55 - also
74:56 - one way and i want to get as much across
74:58 - as i can
74:59 - so if i have to do that in a shocking
75:00 - way to
75:02 - wake you up i will but the goal is my
75:05 - goal is to help
75:06 - transform your belief around you you
75:09 - thinking you're unlucky
75:11 - okay uh i want you to start thinking
75:14 - about where
75:15 - is opportunity you can be crushing it
75:18 - like dude
75:19 - that is so much that is the
75:21 - biggest message i've read
75:23 - today or in a really long time because i
75:26 - go on code mentor and there are
75:28 - developers from nigeria
75:30 - and kenya that are charging 15 to 20
75:34 - dollars
75:35 - per 15 minutes that's a 80
75:39 - an hour hourly rate that they're
75:42 - charging
75:43 - and they're on code mentor io teaching
75:46 - people code people are signing up and
75:48 - paying them they have thousands of
75:49 - reviews
75:50 - the only reason you're saying this is
75:52 - because you
75:53 - might suck at coding and now you're
75:56 - saying
75:56 - unlucky to hide behind the fact that
75:58 - your skill level is just
76:00 - trash so
76:04 - um you might hide behind it for now by
76:06 - saying this and you might be able to
76:08 - trick people around you your friends
76:10 - around you your family members around
76:11 - you it might make you feel great
76:13 - but remember in the long run you're
76:14 - stealing from yourself
76:17 - and you're not going to get to where you
76:19 - personally want to get to in life
76:20 - okay so my goal is to kind of just like
76:23 - flash that mirror and help you see
76:25 - okay because you can certainly be
76:29 - killing it you can be killing it
76:31 - but if your skill level is bad nobody's
76:34 - going to hire you it doesn't matter what
76:35 - country you're living
76:37 - but if you're good people are going to
76:38 - hire you developing is such a hardcore
76:41 - important skill and it's so hard to find
76:43 - good developers
76:44 - your biggest advantage can be you just
76:46 - being a good developer
76:48 - it's ridiculous to say that but so many
76:51 - developers are so bad
76:53 - so if you're just a good developer and
76:55 - you have maybe somewhat decent
76:56 - communication skills
76:57 - you're gonna do really really well but
76:59 - beast you're gonna have to let go of a
77:00 - lot of this victim mentality okay
77:02 - so um there's a lot of possibility out
77:06 - there for you
77:06 - and i think you will be able to do great
77:09 - those are my parting words for you
77:34 - hey i'm kingsley a software developer
77:36 - and i'm finding it hard to find what
77:38 - people are willing to pay for so that i
77:40 - can use my skills in tech
77:41 - to create a solution what do you think i
77:43 - should do um
77:48 - okay so instead of looking what people
77:50 - are willing to pay for what i recommend
77:53 - you do is go to conferences
77:56 - and look for where they need help what
77:58 - are their problems in software
78:00 - development
78:01 - what are the problems in coding that
78:02 - they're facing
78:04 - when you start discovering their
78:06 - problems and caring about people's
78:07 - problems
78:09 - you might be able like it's very
78:11 - tactical
78:12 - okay so it's not that wubu you could go
78:14 - to a conference
78:15 - start talking to a couple of ceos start
78:17 - talking to a couple of
78:19 - software developers where do you guys
78:20 - face problems oh you know
78:22 - i don't have an e-commerce developer and
78:24 - we want to do this and this and this
78:26 - ah e-commerce might be a place i could
78:28 - help great
78:29 - write that down you talk to another one
78:32 - they're like
78:33 - blah blah yeah you know we could use a
78:35 - developer that understands e-commerce
78:36 - really well
78:37 - ah another person that could use a
78:39 - developer that understands e-commerce
78:41 - um you keep getting that and you go oh
78:43 - my god e-commerce can actually be a huge
78:45 - thing where i can help a lot of people
78:47 - and then you reach out to those two
78:48 - people and go hey uh
78:50 - would you like if i could help you and
78:52 - me and you know i can even start helping
78:54 - you for free
78:55 - or i can help you for this rate you know
78:58 - i'd love to be able to help you i think
79:00 - these are but like
79:01 - really deeply understand their problem
79:03 - instead of looking for what people are
79:05 - willing to pay for
79:06 - because you're gonna keep playing that
79:07 - game forever but if you
79:09 - innovate on there's a great book that
79:11 - even nas was reading and recommended to
79:13 - me
79:13 - blue ocean strategy instead of
79:17 - innovating on an offer that people are
79:18 - willing to pay for
79:20 - innovate on value so build a
79:22 - relationship
79:24 - and then go where can i help dude
79:27 - a person like you you know and i i don't
79:30 - mean this in any disrespect but like any
79:32 - software developer
79:32 - most of you guys just need one freaking
79:34 - client and then you're set for like a
79:36 - year or a few years so like
79:37 - it's not a game about like a massive
79:40 - high volume you just need a few
79:41 - developers like
79:42 - 100k 200k like that's not that hard to
79:45 - make that money
79:46 - like they're people making billions of
79:49 - dollars like 100
79:50 - 200k is like nothing i don't mean to
79:53 - say it in a disrespectful way i mean to
79:55 - say it is like there's so much abundance
79:57 - out there there's a lot of money for you
79:59 - and for everybody who's on here
80:02 - there's so much money you can all make
80:04 - and there's so much value you can
80:06 - provide as a software developer
80:07 - javascript developer full stack
80:09 - developer
80:10 - but the the trick is to just
80:14 - build those relationships and really
80:15 - search for where there are problems what
80:17 - are the problems
80:18 - and you need to talk to real people
80:20 - otherwise you're gonna be sitting here
80:22 - looking up online
80:23 - trying to find a niche and you'll never
80:24 - find anything because everything you've
80:26 - ever thought of is done
80:27 - or is not done because it sucks
80:30 - or there's already somebody really good
80:32 - at it and then you're just gonna be like
80:34 - all right back to watching netflix i
80:36 - guess i tried
80:38 - so that that's what i would say and i
80:39 - think that would help you a lot
80:46 - all right
80:50 - uh coding with kenny says sounds good
80:53 - we'll be building a ton of projects
80:54 - would it be a good idea to learn react
80:56 - next
80:56 - after node.js and express sure my
81:00 - my thing is instead of focusing on what
81:02 - to learn next focus
81:03 - on what you're building and what you're
81:05 - making so
81:06 - instead of a technology based focus a
81:10 - building based focus
81:17 - okay um so like
81:21 - like do you need to learn react for the
81:24 - next project that you're building
81:26 - do is it to be ui development heavy
81:29 - okay great then learn react does your
81:34 - app that you want to build will it
81:36 - require a back end
81:38 - great then learn node and and then does
81:40 - it require a lot of
81:42 - path um routing and like that okay
81:44 - cool then learn express
81:46 - so start with what you're doing and then
81:49 - if you need to learn these as tools then
81:51 - keep learning them
81:59 - alex camposano i only have one year of
82:02 - experience
82:03 - and good jobs ask for a minimum of three
82:05 - years
82:06 - how can i prove that i am a good
82:09 - candidate of react yes
82:13 - relationships or
82:17 - or five years of experience
82:24 - you choose it's totally up to you but
82:28 - that's really the game
82:29 - either you build relationships with
82:32 - people
82:33 - and you build a connection and you offer
82:35 - to help and then you get in that way
82:38 - and you will have a lot of chances or
82:40 - you just go head to head with somebody
82:41 - who's a badass on a
82:42 - on a piece of paper and if they have
82:45 - three years or five years you're crushed
82:46 - you're destroyed you're not gonna get
82:48 - that job
82:49 - or maybe you can in your resume somehow
82:52 - highlight that you bring something else
82:53 - to the table but that's so hard to play
82:55 - that game on a piece of paper
82:56 - if you want to play the game on a piece
82:58 - of paper you just have to be a better
82:59 - offer than the other person and that
83:01 - becomes really hard
83:02 - so instead your advantage might be bring
83:05 - that to real life
83:07 - start speaking with people start asking
83:08 - what they need start asking people who
83:10 - are running react companies go to react
83:12 - conferences
83:13 - and talk to people there build
83:14 - relationships there a developer might
83:16 - know a developer that needs a developer
83:18 - okay so those again why these tactics
83:22 - work for most of you people
83:23 - and most people who are looking for a
83:25 - job you just need one or two clients
83:28 - you're good literally for like the next
83:31 - three years most of the times you know
83:32 - the next couple of years
83:34 - so uh it's worth doing why i wouldn't
83:37 - recommend this to a business is it would
83:38 - be too
83:39 - random and business cares about how to
83:41 - generate a client after a client after a
83:43 - client after a client
83:44 - so i wouldn't give this advice as
83:46 - somebody who wants to run a business
83:48 - but for most people just need a few good
83:51 - solid clients and then you're set for a
83:53 - really long time
83:58 - whoa that's cool tuna no crust says i
84:01 - used to work in a prison before i became
84:02 - a developer was not a technical guy at
84:04 - all
84:06 - damn yo tuna we we gotta bring you on
84:09 - the show man
84:11 - send us a message did he send us a
84:12 - message yet
84:15 - okay tuna my team is dming you on
84:19 - instagram
84:19 - so respond either there or send a text
84:22 - message but we want to bring you on bro
84:25 - that's a really great story from a
84:27 - prisoner to a developer that makes two
84:29 - hundred thousand dollars a year
84:42 - wow shreya's code says hey qazi got my
84:45 - internship as a react developer
84:47 - without having a software developer
84:49 - degree only
84:51 - because by watching your videos thanks a
84:53 - lot man respect
84:55 - you got it that's amazing to hear that's
84:58 - that makes me really really happy
84:59 - great job trace
85:06 - i see luke's message
85:11 - corrections officer that's great we're
85:13 - even thinking about like uh
85:15 - going to pre uh going to prisons and
85:17 - offering to help them and actually teach
85:19 - them coding i think that'd be really
85:21 - freaking cool
85:23 - but we don't know how to where to even
85:25 - start so like tuna we might be able to
85:27 - use your help there
85:28 - that would be great um because
85:31 - yeah we have no idea who to speak to
85:32 - about that we have like we have no idea
85:35 - you know but we we know that's something
85:37 - we would like to be able to do
85:44 - whoa that's so cool um this is crazy
85:47 - tuna says i went to a coding bootcamp
85:49 - because i wanted to change careers
85:51 - best decision i've ever made that's
85:53 - awesome man that's awesome yeah a lot of
85:55 - people who are joining coding bootcamps
85:56 - this is our main thing
85:58 - get somewhere change careers fast and
86:01 - then keep going you know that's why we
86:02 - launched our coding bootcamp too that's
86:04 - what we do with people we're like hey
86:06 - get here and most of the people that
86:08 - join are looking to change their careers
86:09 - within a couple of months we have them
86:11 - change their careers get a job as a
86:12 - software developer and they're freaking
86:14 - happy
86:15 - and i think that's why they're popular
86:16 - so that's awesome
86:20 - okay i'm going through your guys's
86:22 - messages okay
86:28 - oh nice alex thank you for the donation
86:33 - really appreciate you really appreciate
86:35 - you
86:36 - um it says to be employed learn a lot of
86:39 - things or master one
86:40 - just depends what job you're trying to
86:42 - get my thing is to get employed
86:44 - work and build awesome deep projects
86:48 - and that will speak for you a lot more
86:50 - than anything else
87:03 - uh okay
87:08 - joe hunger asks can i get a freelancing
87:10 - job with only html css bootstrap and
87:13 - javascript
87:16 - absolutely
87:29 - i have worked my ass off coding for two
87:33 - years made so many projects helped so
87:34 - many friends who are in the industry
87:36 - but i am unable to secure a software
87:39 - engineer
87:40 - job
87:44 - um two years man so many projects have
87:47 - so many friends from industry but i mean
87:49 - there might be another problem there
87:51 - there might be something
87:52 - different like maybe you have trouble
87:55 - securing interviews maybe you have
87:57 - trouble passing either the culture fit
87:59 - interviews or the technical interviews
88:01 - um but there's something else happening
88:04 - there and what's your pipeline of jobs
88:06 - that you're applying to
88:07 - how many interviews are you getting on a
88:09 - regular basis okay are you doing it in a
88:12 - disciplined way do you have like are you
88:13 - reaching out to a hundred companies
88:15 - and getting maybe five interviews and
88:17 - then going through that process and then
88:18 - doing that week after week
88:20 - if you're not that might be the answer
88:22 - okay so it's also not going to just
88:24 - happen
88:25 - randomly you can help people all you
88:27 - want but if you don't like
88:29 - specifically ask for what you need go to
88:32 - those specific job interviews and then
88:35 - you're not going to secure that specific
88:36 - job okay so
88:38 - that might be for a different reason
88:50 - luke lukex asks
88:55 - clever programmer i've been practicing
88:56 - react for months and i want to learn
88:58 - some back-end to make apps interactive
89:00 - what do you suggest
89:02 - sure you can learn
89:06 - node and that would be great
89:09 - and you can make your apps interactive
89:11 - okay or firebase
89:13 - you can even learn firebase and kind of
89:14 - like get rid of node
89:16 - and then firebase gives you a backend
89:18 - too so my personal preference is just
89:20 - jump on the firebase bandwagon
89:32 - i was not a prisoner no i know that i
89:34 - know that it's funny
89:36 - just a corrections officer
89:42 - it's funny cause he never said you were
89:45 - a prisoner canelo
89:46 - that's funny too um
89:50 - terrence ford says almost done with team
89:52 - tree house full stack javascript
89:55 - can someone let me know what i would
89:56 - need to learn to be desirable to a
89:58 - company i do want to freelance but baby
89:59 - steps
90:01 - cool so yeah start with something
90:04 - um in terms of baby steps i would say
90:08 - again if you're already learning these
90:10 - things focus on building projects
90:12 - putting them on your portfolio those are
90:14 - what make you desirable to a company
90:16 - i want to come and go okay let's get
90:19 - past the let's get in an
90:20 - interview taryn show me your projects
90:23 - okay uh great great uh that project is
90:26 - garbage
90:26 - i don't care i'm not gonna say that to
90:28 - you but that's what i'm thinking
90:30 - oh cool uh okay now within the projects
90:32 - let's see scanning through the code code
90:34 - okay he's using some react he looks like
90:36 - he knows some redux okay cool
90:37 - what else um looking through his commits
90:40 - oh his commits are
90:41 - bad uh i don't want to bring this person
90:44 - on
90:44 - or oh he has careful commits okay this
90:47 - looks good the code looks very clean
90:50 - um that's great he has some
90:52 - documentation in the github
90:53 - that where he has this code okay cool
90:55 - what are some other projects what are
90:57 - some other things he's working on
90:58 - okay cool seems like beginner
91:02 - but somebody i can teach um let me give
91:05 - this person an opportunity
91:06 - cool man all right terence let's start
91:08 - working let's uh let's do a week-long
91:10 - shadowing with our company if you're a
91:13 - good fit maybe we can extend an offer to
91:15 - you
91:15 - okay so that those might be a certain
91:17 - examples or they might just be like yeah
91:18 - this is great
91:19 - freaking you start tomorrow but projects
91:22 - is going to be a really important
91:24 - piece of the puzzle
91:30 - another thing we can do guys is like we
91:31 - can have people lined up who maybe want
91:33 - to show us projects
91:35 - and then i can have one-on-one sessions
91:37 - like live coding and review
91:39 - and going through the projects you know
91:41 - and like roasting or whatever
91:44 - like making it entertaining right and
91:45 - then we can put that
91:47 - but this would also help us start a
91:49 - community so if you guys want to start a
91:50 - community we can start linking people to
91:52 - that community too
91:53 - and then amana can start adding people
91:56 - so you can start a slack group or
91:57 - discord it doesn't matter
91:58 - and then a monarch can help manage that
92:00 - as well that could be great
92:04 - um watching from philippines awesome
92:07 - that's cool bro
92:08 - that's awesome
92:12 - okay
92:16 - uh sure of says do you think serverless
92:19 - will replace back end i
92:20 - i don't think it will completely replace
92:23 - it just because there are going to be a
92:24 - lot of people are going to keep doing it
92:25 - but yeah i mean you could use serverless
92:27 - to essentially replace back-end and i
92:29 - prefer it that way i really enjoy coding
92:32 - it
92:32 - coding things like that i rarely ever
92:35 - have
92:37 - back-ends most of my ends are serverless
92:40 - and i just i love that i just honestly
92:44 - feel like it's much easier you don't
92:45 - have to
92:47 - focus on your back end you don't have to
92:48 - work on making your back end scalable
92:51 - none of those things like all of that
92:52 - should automatically be handled
92:54 - and you could use aws you could use
92:56 - versal you could use firebase i mean
92:58 - everybody is now having like a
93:00 - serverless happen
93:02 - so my personal preference is to go more
93:04 - towards serverless but of course
93:08 - both are possible cool
93:11 - all right amazing you guys
93:15 - uh this has been phenomenal
93:18 - i would definitely recommend if you guys
93:20 - want to join
93:22 - um if you guys want to join
93:25 - and come to the live tour just go to
93:29 - javascript tour dot com can we please
93:32 - put this in the
93:33 - description description oh yeah there it
93:35 - is
93:36 - description and also chat okay
93:39 - yeah cool so yeah just add um
93:42 - you can go to this javascript tour it's
93:44 - happening in los angeles
93:47 - all right august 6 through 8th so
93:50 - happening
93:50 - in uh two to three weeks okay
93:54 - this is where it's happening this is how
93:55 - much it is and this helps
93:58 - us kind of cover the cost of the event
94:01 - and yeah that's it we wanted to make it
94:03 - as uh
94:04 - inexpensive for you guys as possible
94:06 - honestly so everybody can show up
94:08 - the only two reasons we even decided to
94:10 - charge is number one so we can cover the
94:12 - cost of the event and then number two
94:14 - is so you show up because every time we
94:17 - make something for free people stop
94:18 - showing up on day two
94:20 - and day three and so that's the only
94:22 - goal of this
94:23 - if you're gonna pay we know you're gonna
94:24 - pay attention you're gonna show up
94:26 - so go get this it's gonna get booked out
94:29 - it's gonna get shut down
94:30 - but i would love to have you there and i
94:33 - would love to work with you in person
94:35 - go through training hardcore training
94:38 - build the projects like i want to
94:40 - have you leaving there like oh my god my
94:42 - mind has exploded
94:44 - but you know even if we can help you get
94:45 - projects on your portfolio or just
94:47 - give you that juice which we're going to
94:49 - be doing a lot here

94:59 - freaking fun it's going to be great
