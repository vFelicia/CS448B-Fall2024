00:00 - hey guys what's up this is kazy from
00:02 - clever
00:03 - program.com so the day has come
00:07 - unfortunately I've been trying to
00:09 - protect you guys from learning about
00:11 - this one thing for a long time now we've
00:14 - been doing our programming tutorials on
00:17 - python we've been making some other fun
00:19 - videos but you guys have to learn one of
00:22 - the most amazing things that you can
00:24 - learn in computer programming and
00:26 - actually one of the most important and
00:28 - fundamental things it's called the
00:32 - command line okay so you guys have to
00:35 - actually learn this no matter how much
00:38 - you try to avoid it so I have thought
00:43 - about and try to put together different
00:45 - ways of how you can learn it and I have
00:48 - found the best resource for you guys to
00:51 - learn this okay because I know this can
00:54 - be a little bit dry but once you start
00:58 - getting a little bit of hang of it it's
01:00 - probably the most fun thing because it
01:01 - gives you some magical powers you can
01:04 - essentially do things around your entire
01:07 - computer without leaving the keyboard
01:10 - and one window you can delete things you
01:13 - can download things you can distribute
01:15 - things throughout your entire computer
01:17 - you can have processes that can save
01:19 - things for you automatically you can run
01:21 - automated tasks like putting something
01:23 - into your computer and then it sends it
01:26 - to some other place automatically for
01:28 - you that You' have done so it does give
01:30 - you some tremendous power without it you
01:33 - actually won't even be able to do things
01:35 - like web development or software
01:37 - development so let's jump right into it
01:40 - and start learning about the command
01:42 - line so this resource you can see up at
01:44 - the top it's the link is this
01:47 - web.mit.edu
01:49 - blah blah blah I'll put that in the
01:51 - description below so you guys can go to
01:53 - it directly but let's just jump into it
01:56 - and start playing around with it okay so
01:59 - I do want you to play around with this
02:01 - game first and get a hang of it and then
02:03 - when you start actually learning the
02:05 - command line things will make a lot of
02:08 - sense and you will be kind of ready to
02:10 - go right from the start so okay let's
02:14 - see what kind of options it's giving us
02:16 - okay it says look at your surroundings
02:18 - with the command
02:19 - LS so the command LS in the Linux
02:22 - command line or whatever actually really
02:25 - stands you know I forget what it stands
02:27 - for but essentially it's for listing
02:29 - files or listing things so you get to
02:32 - see where you are okay so if you are
02:35 - currently in the directory like user SL
02:38 - whatever slazi and maybe you have
02:41 - documents or whatever around you LS is
02:43 - the way you actually look around okay so
02:46 - let's go ahead and type that in so I
02:49 - typed in LS and you can see it's showing
02:51 - me some different locations around me
02:54 - it's showing me this green land with the
02:57 - big building so what can can we do with
03:00 - this it says here are your locations
03:02 - Western Forest Northern Meadow MIT and
03:05 - then you have some items like welcome
03:08 - letter okay so what can we do to this
03:11 - what can we do with this information so
03:14 - to move to a new location you can do CD
03:17 - location so that's the equivalent of
03:20 - actually moving into a directory CD
03:22 - stands for change directory so let's
03:26 - change our directory okay so let's go
03:29 - into to maybe the Western Forest H I
03:32 - want to see what's there let's go CD
03:35 - Western forest and now in command line
03:38 - you don't actually have to complete the
03:39 - whole command if you're partway right
03:41 - with what you're trying to do you can
03:43 - just hit Tab and it will autocomplete it
03:45 - for you so I just did CD we and I just
03:50 - hit Tab and it autoc completed it for me
03:53 - another reason why I'm on this website
03:55 - is because if you have Windows you are
03:57 - going to run into some terminal and
03:58 - command line problem
04:00 - this avoids that so when you're learning
04:02 - it you're not being distracted by
04:04 - anything and then you can download
04:06 - something called git Bash that's git
04:10 - bash you can download that and then play
04:12 - around with the same command line that
04:14 - essentially the Linux or MacBooks or
04:18 - yuntu they offer you okay so let's keep
04:22 - going CD Western Forest so now I'm in
04:25 - the western Forest I don't see anything
04:28 - I'm kind of blind so every time I'm I
04:29 - move into a new location the first thing
04:31 - I should try to do is maybe look around
04:34 - right that's what you do when you enter
04:35 - a new room so let's do that let's hit LS
04:38 - again without even thinking I want to
04:40 - get into this directory H hit LS so
04:43 - you've moved into Western Forest you
04:45 - enter and travel deep into the forest
04:48 - eventually the path leads to a clearing
04:50 - with a large impressive building a sign
04:52 - on it reads spellcasting Academy the
04:56 - Elite School of
04:57 - magic all right so look around and we
05:00 - see some trees we see this big building
05:04 - in the back what what is that all about
05:06 - maybe I want to go explore that so here
05:10 - I have spellcasting Academy that's a
05:12 - location I can go to and I have some
05:14 - items sign and back sign hm how can I
05:17 - read these items okay so for example if
05:20 - I actually opened up my terminal right
05:22 - let's let's just do this live so let me
05:25 - open up my terminal no thank you I don't
05:27 - need any updates right now and uh you
05:30 - can see I have a lot of stuff around me
05:32 - right Anaconda applications Seine
05:34 - projects desktop and all this right so
05:38 - if I want to actually change into one of
05:40 - these directories I can do CD documents
05:43 - and that will take me to that directory
05:45 - but notice I don't see what files are in
05:48 - documents so to do that well what
05:50 - command can I actually hit to look
05:52 - around me if you've been following along
05:55 - so far you will know that the command is
05:56 - LS so I will do LS and hit enter and I
06:00 - can look around me I see Adobe I see
06:02 - chess tastic I see clever programmer I
06:04 - see the directory Final Cut Pro and to
06:07 - show you guys this in real life kind of
06:10 - what it looks like is let me open up my
06:12 - finder here and let me go to documents
06:15 - where is
06:18 - documents uh documents right there and
06:20 - you can see Adobe is the first one right
06:23 - and that we see that right there then we
06:25 - got chest tastic we see that clever
06:27 - programmer Final Cut Pro and you guys
06:29 - get the idea so we're actually changing
06:32 - directories changing things kind of
06:34 - right from within the
06:36 - terminal okay and then later I'll show
06:38 - you guys how to do things like run your
06:40 - python script right from the terminal
06:44 - but uh right now I'm just trying to get
06:45 - you guys the idea and make you guys
06:47 - comfortable with it okay so that's how
06:50 - LS is working right in your command line
06:52 - okay command line terminal I will be um
06:56 - interchangeably using these terms so
06:58 - don't get confused I'm essentially
07:01 - saying the same
07:02 - thing okay now how do I read something
07:06 - right so what if we have something to
07:07 - read like for example products export
07:10 - one that does not look like a directory
07:13 - that looks like a file so how would I
07:15 - read that well I think I can do less do
07:18 - products um export and hit numbers and
07:22 - uh yeah see it anyways so it is a binary
07:25 - file so it doesn't make sense to
07:26 - actually see it but you you can see that
07:29 - that if you do less it'll show you so
07:32 - less is essentially for showing you the
07:34 - contents of the file so if you had some
07:35 - txt file with some text in it you can
07:38 - actually take a peek in it without
07:40 - getting inside of it so if we want to
07:43 - look at our item sign and back signs
07:45 - perhaps we can use the less command so
07:47 - less sign hit tap to autocomplete don't
07:50 - type it all in because you will make a
07:53 - mistake or a typo and also cuz you're
07:55 - lazy and you don't want to type that
07:57 - much right uh I know I am so let's hit
07:59 - Les sign and we see this spellcasting
08:03 - Academy the elite sign the Elite School
08:05 - of magic today only free introductory
08:09 - lessons novice is welcome okay cool
08:12 - let's read about back
08:15 - sign if you ever want to go directly
08:17 - home just type CD with the squiggly or
08:21 - just play an old CD and you'll get back
08:24 - home getting back home might be more
08:27 - getting back might be more difficult
08:28 - though hm so let's
08:32 - see right now I'm in this Forest right
08:36 - but initially when we started we were in
08:39 - some other location where we could have
08:41 - gone to Western Forest right so right
08:42 - now we're into W Western Forest how can
08:44 - we go back well let's hit CD and let's
08:47 - see if it takes us back let's hit LS and
08:49 - we can see that we're back now let's do
08:51 - the same thing in our terminal so we
08:53 - make sure that what we're learning in
08:54 - this play environment is actually uh in
08:58 - tune with our actual environment in our
09:01 - computer so let's hit you can see that
09:04 - I'm in this directory documents this
09:07 - probably is not my home directory as a
09:09 - matter of fact it's not so let me hit CD
09:12 - and let's just go back to our home
09:13 - directory so anytime I'm lost and I'm
09:15 - too deep in some directory I can always
09:18 - hit CD and get back home okay so now if
09:22 - I look I'm back
09:24 - home all right well there's one more
09:27 - cool thing so at the top they introduced
09:30 - a command called PWD and that command
09:33 - shows you where you are so whenever you
09:35 - are lost and you want to know exactly
09:37 - what your location is what your address
09:39 - is you can hit PWD it's the equivalent
09:42 - of going onto Google and looking up
09:44 - where am I right now okay that's what
09:47 - your PW D is and how you read it is
09:50 - actually print working directory so if I
09:54 - open up my terminal again and I do PWD
09:56 - you can see it tells me I'm in/ users SL
09:59 - chest tastic well that's my home
10:01 - directory if I go back to documents hit
10:04 - tab um come here if I do PWD you can see
10:08 - it goes SL user slj tastic SL documents
10:12 - okay so maybe you guys are getting more
10:15 - of the idea so I wanted to introduce you
10:18 - guys with the ls command that's the one
10:21 - you always use like without even
10:23 - thinking I wanted to introduce you to
10:25 - the CD command the change directory
10:27 - command so you can actually move move
10:29 - back and forth leave a room and come
10:32 - back to a room and then I wanted to tell
10:34 - you PWD which is essentially where are
10:37 - you okay so that's it for this video and
10:40 - in the next video I'll show you guys how
10:42 - you can actually run your own scripts
10:44 - all right guys I'll see you there
