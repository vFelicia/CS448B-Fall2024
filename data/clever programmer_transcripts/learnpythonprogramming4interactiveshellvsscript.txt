00:00 - - Okay, in this video,
00:01 - I'm gonna go over the solution
to the previous problem
00:03 - that I posed to you, and also,
00:05 - we're gonna learn how to write the turtle,
00:07 - the entire thing,
00:09 - in one go.
00:11 - So, the problem that I posed to you is,
00:14 - make a square with the turtle.
00:16 - Well, in your case,
00:17 - let's see how you could do exactly that.
00:21 - So, let me find the file
where we opened up the turtle.
00:23 - Let me close that guy right there.
00:25 - Copy this line and paste it right there.
00:29 - Okay, my turtle has begun.
00:31 - Well, the idea is simple.
00:34 - I take this line forward, and go 100.
00:38 - Now, since sometimes programmers are lazy,
00:40 - I don't want to keep writing
this over and over again,
00:42 - so one thing I can do
to make my life easier
00:45 - is go to the line that I want to click on,
00:48 - I want to use, basically.
00:50 - Go to that line, click my mouse there,
00:52 - hit 'enter', it brings
that down at the bottom,
00:55 - as you can see right here.
00:56 - And now I can just hit 'enter'.
00:59 - So, you can see my turtle
just moved left, okay?
01:02 - Now it's facing up.
01:05 - Now what I want to do is
move it forward again,
01:08 - and you can see that it's facing up again,
01:11 - er, I'm sorry, it's ...
01:13 - It moved up, now I need
to make it face left.
01:16 - So, how do I do that?
01:17 - I go left, make it turn 90 degrees,
01:19 - and you can see it turned 90 degrees.
01:22 - Now I want it to move 100 again.
01:25 - You can see it move forward.
01:27 - And 90 degrees, and then 100 once again,
01:31 - and I have made the square.
01:34 - Now, what I want you to be able to do is,
01:38 - make a Python file, which means that,
01:41 - remember this thing that
we opened up right here,
01:45 - where we write all of the code at once?
01:48 - So, for example,
01:50 - I'm gonna close it,
01:51 - I'm gonna show you how
to open it again, okay?
01:53 - So, I'm gonna close this one,
01:54 - and I will simply open it again.
01:56 - 'New file', or 'Command-N'.
01:59 - And I will go and put
it to the right side,
02:02 - just so I have these side by side,
02:05 - and I will say something
like 'import turtle'.
02:08 - Remember that command.
02:09 - If you don't use that command
02:11 - and you try to do 'turtle',
02:12 - your program will be like,
02:14 - "What the heck is 'turtle'?"
02:16 - So, by doing 'import turtle',
02:18 - now it knows what 'turtle' is.
02:20 - It's like when you're
talking about your friends,
02:24 - if you talk about your friend John, right?
02:27 - Like, let's say you're
talking about your friend John
02:29 - to your mom, or to your dad,
02:32 - and you're like,
02:33 - "Dad, this guy blah blah blah",
02:35 - you're dad's gonna be like,
02:36 - "Who the heck is John?"
02:37 - So, you're gonna be like,
02:38 - "Oh, yeah, you remember John
from my fifth grade class?"
02:43 - And then your dad, if
you're talking to him,
02:44 - he's gonna say,
02:45 - "Oh, okay, I know who
you're talking about".
02:47 - So, 'import' is basically like,
02:50 - hey, Python,
02:51 - import that turtle that
those coders wrote,
02:54 - and now we can use it,
02:55 - and Python is like,
02:56 - "Oh, that turtle",
02:58 - but if you don't have this
'import' command here,
03:01 - Python's gonna be like,
03:02 - "What the heck?
03:03 - "What turtle are you talking about?
03:04 - "You must be out of your mind."
03:06 - Anyways.
03:07 - We're gonna import this turtle.
03:09 - Alright, so now here's
what I want you to do.
03:11 - I want you to write a
script that makes the turtle
03:14 - in one single go, okay?
03:18 - And I want you to make
that square with the turtle
03:21 - straight up in one go.
03:22 - For example,
03:23 - let's come over here to our
script that I've written,
03:26 - and if I write stuff here,
03:28 - it does things immediately, right?
03:30 - As you saw,
03:30 - but if I come to my
right side over here ...
03:34 - Oh, by the way, just one quick note.
03:36 - Whatever you do, do not
name this file 'turtle.py'.
03:40 - You can name it 'turtle_game', or 'game',
03:44 - or something else,
03:45 - just don't name it turtle,
03:47 - because then it confuses this turtle here
03:49 - with this file,
03:50 - and everything goes all over the place.
03:53 - So, don't do that,
03:54 - 'cause I ended up doing that
and it caused lots of problems.
03:58 - Alright, so let me just
show you what happens
04:00 - when I run this file.
04:02 - I'll go to 'Run', I'll hit 'Run module',
04:04 - and hit 'OK'.
04:06 - And you can see that my turtle went
04:08 - and did all those things in one go.
04:10 - How cool is that?
04:11 - So you don't have to sit
there, type it all in.
04:13 - You can just write it in one go,
04:14 - and it'll do that every single time.
04:17 - So, I want you to work on that square,
04:19 - but before you go and do that,
04:21 - I just want to show you what
this file actually looks like.
04:24 - So, if I go to,
04:29 - let's say,
04:30 - 'Documents', and 'Clever Programmer',
04:33 - 'Practice Exercises',
04:35 - and we take a look at
this file, 'turtle_game',
04:38 - it's just a text file with
this code in here, okay?
04:42 - That's really it, that's
all that's going on in here.
04:45 - So, I'm gonna
04:47 - leave it here.
04:50 - The code that you write for the square,
04:52 - I want you to either go
to the Youtube place,
04:55 - Youtube channel, and
post it in the comments,
04:58 - or I want you to paste your
code right here in the comments
05:01 - on cleverprogrammer.com, okay?
05:03 - I'm gonna take a look at it.
05:05 - I will see you in the next video.
