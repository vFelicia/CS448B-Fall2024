07:00 - uh very important if you do not have the
07:02 - code
07:03 - for this portion okay the article was
07:05 - uploaded to github i think we should
07:07 - have a link somewhere maybe
07:08 - somewhere maybe we could post it on
07:10 - youtube or maybe
07:12 - david if you're watching this maybe you
07:13 - can post it in the um
07:15 - description below somewhere i think
07:17 - description below but we should have a
07:19 - link to github which should be to our
07:20 - products that we have been working on
07:21 - from yesterday
07:23 - and so what do we do yesterday we'll
07:24 - check this out this is what we did right
07:26 - we built a slack clone that looks
07:27 - exactly like this
07:28 - right it looks really good right i mean
07:30 - it looks it really looks
07:32 - really really good right so look at this
07:33 - right that's part of one that's what we
07:35 - did
07:36 - um for today our goal is to get to kind
07:38 - of like this
07:39 - that's for today so our goal is to be
07:41 - able to number one create this portion
07:43 - create this portion that's not part two
07:45 - uh make these channels be actually
07:48 - firebase channel so they're actually
07:49 - channels that are coming from a database
07:52 - so finally get a taste on how to
07:53 - interact with a database with you know
07:55 - so it kind of
07:56 - this kind of gets updated automatically
07:58 - and on top of that
07:59 - you will be able to add your own channel
08:00 - for example if i click plus let's say
08:02 - which channel we want to add
08:03 - day three let's go day three let's say
08:06 - day three let's say
08:07 - day three of the challenge day three i'm
08:10 - gonna say okay
08:10 - right here and look at that now we have
08:12 - a new channel over here says day three
08:14 - see right there so cool right and that's
08:16 - in an actual database the data is being
08:18 - stored
08:19 - for a long period of time of course yes
08:21 - data is being always stored
08:22 - this is how epic that is okay cool so we
08:25 - got that that's day three
08:26 - next up what are we going to do is then
08:29 - we're going to
08:30 - make this and then also one thing i was
08:32 - going to add as well
08:33 - is we might also need and if we have
08:34 - time depending on the time
08:36 - we might also add this portion as well
08:39 - so we're getting closer and closer to
08:41 - finishing up the slack clone day by day
08:43 - and just a quick reminder guys
08:45 - if you happen to maybe have gotten lost
08:47 - during the video do not
08:48 - worry just keep watching the video keep
08:51 - seeing what it is that
08:52 - you know we're building out learn from
08:54 - this experience and you can
08:55 - always watch the replay so if you get
08:58 - lost or if we're going too fast
08:59 - don't worry sit down enjoy learn from
09:02 - this experience
09:03 - and you could re-watch the live and go
09:05 - through it at your own pace
09:06 - as you know guys this is recorded this
09:08 - is pre-recorded guys very right so
09:10 - as right if so if you're stuck don't
09:13 - worry if you can't keep up
09:14 - don't worry most important thing is that
09:16 - you're being proactive with what you're
09:17 - doing right
09:18 - you're taking the time to learn
09:19 - something new and it may be hard and
09:21 - it's supposed to be hard right
09:22 - but again remember this guys it's very
09:24 - important nothing worth having in life
09:26 - comes easy
09:27 - that's the one big thing i personally
09:28 - live by and whenever something gets
09:30 - challenging
09:31 - it doesn't mean i quit doesn't mean i
09:32 - stop i just keep going
09:34 - okay that's the whole goal that's that's
09:36 - how i've shut up my life pretty much

10:34 - of that make sure the next time we have
10:36 - that okay
10:37 - cool all right so uh for this one guys
10:40 - what's the first i'm gonna do well part
10:41 - one what i'm going to do is
10:43 - part one let's do part one let's go
10:45 - ahead and
10:47 - um add firebase so add our firebase
10:49 - section right so add
10:50 - firebase database that's what it's
10:52 - called so to do that guys
10:54 - just follow along with me it's pretty
10:55 - simple process all right here's what you
10:56 - need to do
10:57 - let's go ahead and go to firebase okay
10:59 - we'll go to firebase.com
11:01 - okay that's pretty much it firebase.com
11:06 - once your firebase let's go ahead and
11:07 - log in so i'm going to log in with this
11:10 - uh account right now so make sure you
11:11 - log in right so if you log in it's a
11:14 - again pretty simple process guys okay uh
11:17 - just click log in sign up if you're not
11:19 - signed up i'm going to go to console for
11:21 - my for my sake
11:22 - and i'm going to do add project that's
11:25 - what you need to do
11:26 - once you've added a project what's gonna
11:28 - happen is let's go ahead and do this
11:30 - let's call it slack clone slack
11:34 - what do we call slack loan what we
11:35 - should call slack clone
11:37 - slash challenge challenge oh right there
11:39 - all right cool beans
11:41 - cool beans as always all right so slide
11:43 - clone challenge next continue
11:44 - beautiful uh we don't need this specific
11:46 - portion it's analytics don't worry about
11:48 - that click project
11:49 - oh now screen the project and now we can
11:52 - dance
11:53 - and dance while it's creating while it's
11:55 - creating
11:56 - a dance and dance so by the way someone
12:00 - asked are we going to be building
12:02 - a search function as well since we had
12:04 - the search bar yesterday
12:05 - that's good question maybe we'll see
12:07 - maybe depends on how far we could get
12:09 - these next today and tomorrow and make
12:12 - good progress that was actually the next
12:14 - feature we can do about but
12:15 - if we don't that is a great
12:17 - functionality
12:19 - that you can build and look into right
12:22 - and the reason is because you want to
12:24 - make sure that you understand
12:25 - what it is you're building right because
12:26 - very often people struggle when they
12:28 - don't understand what it is they're
12:29 - building and they just fall tutorial but
12:31 - if you build these extra features by
12:32 - yourself you really get
12:33 - in there and really get to understand it
12:35 - yes yes yes yes yes yes
12:38 - exactly so guys by the way um
12:46 - [Music]
12:50 - right
12:54 - all right we're good all right let's get
12:56 - started guys so we have a project
12:58 - that was right ahead because the project
13:00 - is done click go ahead and click
13:01 - continue beautiful
13:03 - awesome that is continuing on that's
13:06 - what we need to do so why
13:07 - while it's doing that that's good so
13:09 - firebase guys is a database right it is
13:11 - what we're going to communicate with
13:12 - right for this portion let's go ahead
13:14 - and click create you see this web button
13:16 - right here
13:16 - click on this web button right here
13:19 - right there this web button
13:21 - click on this one and this is going to
13:22 - create uh the configuration which we
13:25 - need
13:26 - for you know for our website okay so
13:28 - let's go ahead and call this slack clone
13:31 - challenge challenge right there uh
13:35 - you can do firebase solution that's fine
13:36 - you can see click on this for now that's
13:38 - just fine
13:39 - click on register app right there boom
13:42 - so that's going to happen it's going to
13:43 - registration
13:44 - register our app app in firebase we
13:46 - don't need this person right
13:48 - here guys this is not needed okay this
13:50 - is not needed
13:51 - however we do need this stuff right here
13:53 - so a few things you see how it says
13:54 - npm install firebase tools we need to do
13:58 - that so let's do that right now
13:59 - i will go ahead in my section right here
14:02 - i'm going to open up it to integrate
14:03 - terminal i'm in my code
14:05 - so let's do that right now so right
14:06 - click open in integrated terminal
14:09 - okay and then and then
14:12 - i'm going to say npm installed i'm going
14:14 - to close up my section some say npm
14:16 - ah that's not what i want npm install
14:19 - we'll do at first we'll do firebase
14:21 - so the first thing you wanna install
14:22 - guys is firebase you see what as i'm
14:24 - highlighting right now
14:25 - right there ah no this is the first
14:28 - thing you wanna do
14:28 - is firebase right here so we'll do npm
14:30 - install firebase that should install
14:31 - firebase for us
14:32 - so that we can use it okay because if
14:35 - you can't use it then what's the point
14:36 - of it
14:37 - exactly so whenever usually whenever you
14:39 - try to use a tool you need to install
14:40 - its dependencies or you need to install
14:42 - it to libraries so you can actually
14:44 - use these external tools yes exactly
14:48 - and somebody said hey nas you're in
14:49 - source don't worry about it that doesn't
14:51 - matter when you do npm install
14:52 - it's going to install unknown modules
14:54 - here guys right and no matter if i'm in
14:56 - source or public as long as i'm in my
14:58 - project
14:59 - it's going to make sure to install it in
15:01 - no modules
15:02 - this is where all of our modules our
15:04 - firebase modules are installed so for
15:05 - example
15:06 - if i look into here okay you guys should
15:08 - see a b c
15:09 - d
15:25 - right there you see it where oh right
15:28 - there see that's the fireplace right
15:29 - there see
15:30 - so installed firebase every module that
15:32 - you install gets installed in
15:34 - non-modules right
15:35 - this is how projects work they they get
15:37 - dependencies from those
15:39 - modules folder okay cool so that's all
15:42 - branno
15:42 - now we've got no firebase let's go and
15:44 - install firebase tools
15:46 - so i'm gonna do the same thing npm
15:47 - install dash g firebase tools
15:49 - but i will now use the dash g for now
15:51 - i'll just do it or only specific to this
15:53 - to this um what's it called to this uh
15:57 - project some of the npm install firebase
15:59 - tools
16:00 - okay yo check this out nas i don't know
16:02 - if you could highlight it oh
16:03 - let's go where's the craig craig craig
16:06 - matthews
16:12 - hey craig how you doing man thank you so
16:14 - much what is up what is up
16:16 - great to have you so much what is this
16:18 - two year old what is it two euro what is
16:19 - that i don't know is that i have no idea
16:21 - regardless thank you so much we couldn't
16:23 - appreciate
16:24 - it anymore yes thank you so we got the
16:26 - firebase tools we got firebase click
16:28 - next and here
16:29 - we don't need this just yet guys this is
16:31 - going to be for when we
16:33 - guess what i know this can be used for
16:34 - what is it going to be
16:36 - deployed what is deploying us deploy
16:39 - means you put our
16:41 - project live for everybody can see just
16:43 - how you you go to google.com
16:45 - it's live it's on the server we're going
16:46 - to put our project on the server later
16:48 - on
16:48 - that's going to be that's gonna be guys
16:49 - day three so instead of a local host you
16:51 - could send the url to your friend
16:53 - and they can open up your slack clone
16:55 - and if you open up your slide clone you
16:57 - guys can start chatting
16:58 - exactly continue to continue to console
17:00 - that's part one so now we have that
17:02 - okay now what we need to do is a few a
17:05 - few things let's go to project settings
17:07 - in here and if we have here you can see
17:10 - how there's
17:11 - cdn configuration we need to click on
17:13 - the configuration config button
17:15 - this right here guys is going to be the
17:17 - key the api key to our firebase right
17:20 - there this is the
17:21 - firebase key right there right see so
17:23 - we're going to go ahead and copy this
17:25 - so copy this portion right here and then
17:28 - what's going to happen
17:29 - is the following so let's go ahead and
17:31 - do this
17:33 - you still need the terminal oh yeah i
17:35 - can close it out no problem
17:37 - perfect yeah so at this point let's go
17:40 - ahead and do the following we
17:42 - inside the source inside source click
17:44 - right click new file
17:46 - and let's create firebase.js firebase.js
17:50 - perfect
17:51 - this is going to be the configuration
17:52 - for our firebase a few things we need to
17:54 - do here
17:55 - is the following so we need to import
17:56 - firebase as part one so we'll say import
17:59 - firebase from from firebase
18:02 - module remember how we installed the
18:04 - module well we're going to use it now
18:06 - so that's part one part two let's do the
18:09 - following thing let's paste in the
18:10 - config that we had on the right-hand
18:12 - side so paste this in
18:13 - boom right there that's the config okay
18:15 - there's a config to our database and
18:17 - everybody
18:18 - everybody when you guys log in you will
18:20 - have a different configuration
18:22 - make sense make sense of course because
18:24 - you know because that's how it is
18:25 - so then we'll say then we'll initialize
18:27 - our firebase app so here's we'll do
18:29 - we'll say const cons we'll say
18:33 - firebase app is equal to what is equal
18:36 - to firebase
18:39 - dot initial initialize app boom right
18:43 - there
18:43 - and then we'll say the inside initialize
18:45 - app will pass in the config so we'll say
18:47 - firebase
18:50 - um config right there so i'm gonna copy
18:51 - this uh right there
18:53 - firebase config i'll paste into here but
18:55 - right there done okay
18:57 - so add that in we've got that next up
18:59 - let's go ahead and do the following so
19:02 - then we'll do we'll initialize our
19:03 - database so
19:05 - in order to access database we'll say i
19:07 - have to say like this so say const db
19:10 - is equal to we'll say firebase app
19:13 - firebase app right
19:17 - dot fire store
19:20 - so firestore what is firestore you know
19:22 - i i'm not sure what is firestore so
19:24 - firesource is the database firestore is
19:26 - the real-time database in firebase
19:28 - because firebase
19:29 - has many components has many resources
19:32 - there as you know there's
19:33 - ability to actually push it live you
19:35 - know to deploy your project visibility
19:37 - there's so many different things they've
19:38 - got right but in our case we're just
19:40 - using the firestore for now
19:41 - all right so we're going to initialize
19:43 - that does that make sense or do i need
19:44 - to make sense that makes sense okay
19:46 - and then since we get this database in
19:49 - order to be able to
19:50 - use it guys ever in our project we have
19:53 - to export it now
19:54 - so because when we export it then we can
19:56 - import it into different files and use
19:58 - it does that make sense
19:59 - very similar to any component right we
20:00 - always have the export all the way at
20:02 - the bottom of the component yes
20:04 - exactamente
20:08 - so export right there so we'll say
20:12 - export i will say ah no that's not how
20:14 - you spell export
20:15 - we'll explain export default
20:18 - db done done so that's understandable
20:23 - okay now we could use dbe everywhere we
20:26 - want everywhere we want
20:27 - everywhere anywhere ever so now we have
20:29 - a database guys check this out we've got
20:31 - our database
20:32 - okay we can extract the store here now
20:34 - you don't see anything yet but look at
20:35 - this
20:36 - okay let's go to cloud firestore which
20:38 - you see
20:39 - right here a key right here okay i came
20:42 - in here for spanish
20:43 - so right there cloud firestore click on
20:45 - cloud firestore
20:47 - right there cloud fire store there and
20:50 - inside this will
20:51 - go to create database click start in
20:53 - test mode right there
20:54 - click next click net enable
20:58 - for now okay
21:01 - yo yo guys by the way we are at 199
21:04 - likes we're about to cross 200 likes
21:05 - let's go
21:07 - 200 likes and we crossed 200 likes
21:10 - that's what i'm talking about
21:14 - while firebase is loading yes as always
21:16 - cannot enable files for this project
21:18 - after you set this location you cannot
21:20 - um interesting click enable again let's
21:22 - try one time
21:25 - let's try it one more time
21:28 - oh oh now it's working right there
21:31 - for some reason i don't know why it
21:33 - wasn't working before
21:36 - so thank god because then we would have
21:38 - to debug some stuff
21:40 - right at the beginning i know right so
21:42 - we've got slack clone challenge so we've
21:44 - created our database
21:45 - so now let's create a collection now
21:47 - what is a collection can you explain or
21:49 - do you know the collection
21:50 - would a collection be the way we're
21:51 - gonna store data into this database yes
21:54 - think of a collection is like it's like
21:56 - um i don't know like a like a
21:58 - collection is like a notebook guys look
21:59 - at this you see how i'm gonna have a
22:00 - notebook on here
22:01 - in my hands collection is a notebook
22:03 - every single page
22:05 - contains some text or contains some data
22:07 - on it right there's nothing in here
22:08 - right
22:08 - but every page is a tone think of it as
22:10 - like its own entry right
22:12 - so whenever you want if we if our goal
22:13 - is to be able to get channels right
22:16 - right there's be one channel on one page
22:18 - this could be another channel on another
22:19 - page
22:20 - but the notebook is the collection of
22:22 - pages okay so
22:23 - in my notebook maybe i have some pages
22:25 - that are dedicated to recipes
22:27 - yes and they have other pages that are
22:28 - dedicated to just reflection and diaries
22:31 - well here's a cool thing every notebook
22:33 - will have a difference that will have a
22:34 - different title so for example let's say
22:36 - it's a recipes
22:37 - you'll have notebook just for recipes oh
22:39 - okay let's say and then you let's say
22:40 - you have something else let's say what
22:42 - else did you say
22:43 - uh i don't know your journal in your
22:44 - diary diary right
22:46 - then you have another notebook another
22:47 - collection for your diary
22:49 - so it's like a table almost if you think
22:50 - of it in coding that makes sense to me
22:52 - cool so let's go and do that so start
22:54 - collection and here we'll say
22:56 - rooms because we're going to uh for the
22:58 - channels we're just going to say rooms
22:59 - for now
23:00 - so rooms that's going to be and we're
23:02 - going to create our first room now when
23:03 - we create our first room again
23:05 - think of it as a room as just like a
23:06 - page guys we'll create a unique id
23:08 - because we need to be able to identify
23:11 - one page or one room with unique and
23:13 - then we'll say
23:14 - name right what should be our first name
23:16 - for a room
23:18 - uh programmer okay oh i see what you're
23:22 - saying the ones that we already had
23:23 - before yes exactly clever programmer so
23:25 - that's that's we're going to create
23:26 - our first for now okay let's click save
23:29 - look at this now now we have a
23:30 - collection right there rooms
23:33 - that's database inside this room we have
23:35 - one document imagine this as one page
23:38 - right one page has a unique id and that
23:40 - page has a name of clever programmer
23:43 - that's the room individual room
23:44 - individual collection
23:46 - yep cool so now how do we get those
23:49 - there's rooms
23:50 - good question so now let's go back to
23:52 - our code and we can now get this data
23:54 - guys this is so cool just pay attention
23:56 - just
23:57 - this is so freaking cool you have no
23:59 - idea
24:00 - all right look at this let's go back to
24:03 - here
24:03 - let's go to let's go to components
24:07 - and let's go to chat chat now now
24:10 - in the chat actually let's go to right
24:12 - now let's go to app.js for now
24:14 - okay and empty to yes let's go to we'll
24:16 - create a function
24:18 - to be able to get channels so to get
24:20 - rooms all right so let's go ahead and do
24:21 - that
24:22 - let's say see so let's go ahead and
24:25 - create
24:26 - a nutshell yes
24:29 - right there so we'll create a get
24:31 - channels function so i'm going to say
24:32 - const
24:33 - get channels guys right there get
24:36 - channels is equal to dust this this this
24:39 - that's our function now how do we grab
24:42 - the channels that's a good question well
24:43 - look at this
24:44 - i'm going to remember remember how we
24:46 - exported db inside firebase right here
24:50 - now we can import it perfect let's
24:52 - import it let's bring it in
24:53 - yes we'll save this import
24:56 - db from
25:00 - from look at this from where
25:03 - from firebase right far this this right
25:06 - here
25:07 - is coming directly from this right here
25:10 - makes sense
25:10 - yep cool so that's gonna be our firebase
25:13 - that's awesome now what do we do
25:15 - well to get a database
25:18 - here's what's going to happen we do db
25:22 - dot collection collection
25:26 - css users binary is going to be rooms
25:30 - because our collection of room is called
25:32 - rooms
25:33 - right there so we're going to get that
25:35 - database collection
25:36 - you see this is a collection you see how
25:38 - it's starting to make sense a little bit
25:39 - right yeah this is a collection it's a
25:40 - collection of rooms
25:42 - and then what's going to happen is it's
25:44 - something called on snapshot
25:46 - on snapshot now on snapchat it's
25:48 - basically
25:50 - a basically it's um a snapshot of like
25:53 - if you imagine you take a picture of
25:54 - right of us right it's a snapshot right
25:57 - at a one point in time right a snapshot
26:00 - is a snapshot of a picture of a database
26:02 - in terms of what it has inside of it
26:03 - does that make sense
26:04 - that makes perfect sense yes so on
26:06 - snapshot what we'll do is we'll do a
26:08 - snapshot and then this takes in a
26:09 - snapshot this is
26:10 - imagine this as a picture right well
26:12 - it's not a picture it's just a picture
26:14 - it's just it contains the data inside
26:16 - the collection
26:18 - cool and inside here here's will do
26:21 - this is where we will go ahead and
26:22 - console the log
26:24 - for now let's console the log what
26:26 - console.log
26:28 - uh snapshot.doc so here's what we'll do
26:31 - so the log snapshot snap
26:34 - shot dot docs this is going to give us
26:37 - the data
26:38 - for now i'm just going to go to
26:39 - console.login okay perfect i'm going to
26:41 - save this for now
26:42 - right and here's our react app now if i
26:45 - refresh this
26:46 - and i right click inspect download guys
26:48 - to go ahead and see the console
26:49 - really nothing's happening here we only
26:51 - have this area which doesn't not the
26:52 - most important thing
26:54 - but really there's nothing here do you
26:55 - see that i see
26:57 - now what do you do to actually have a
26:58 - consult the pro the reason why it's not
27:00 - there is because this kitchen is just a
27:01 - function
27:03 - well we need to call it we need to call
27:05 - functions it's called function
27:07 - so to call a function i can just do this
27:10 - correct i can just do get channels
27:12 - no problem right i could just do this no
27:14 - problem
27:15 - right so if i do this right you see
27:17 - there we go we get right there this is
27:19 - all we get
27:19 - exactly now someone just asked them
27:21 - questions if they if you can explain
27:23 - console.log
27:24 - so maybe since you just showed it you
27:26 - could quickly talk about it
27:27 - yes so console.log guys really important
27:30 - content unlock is imagine kind of like
27:32 - uh you're printing something just to
27:34 - test something out
27:36 - you see how we have a console right here
27:38 - for every single website
27:40 - there's a console the console is like
27:42 - basically the behind the scenes of
27:43 - what's happening
27:44 - uh what's going on in the you know in
27:47 - the project
27:48 - right so a lot of times developers they
27:50 - can console a lot of stuff to be able to
27:52 - test
27:52 - how the website is working to make sure
27:54 - if it's working properly
27:56 - right yeah so in real life how can we
27:59 - put this in real life in terms of
28:00 - practice
28:01 - like for me console could be like okay
28:04 - for me
28:05 - console will be like let's say i have a
28:06 - thought in my mind and i want to see if
28:08 - it works properly i will write down a
28:09 - piece of paper
28:10 - right it's a console right it's going
28:13 - from my brain to whatever's in here
28:15 - the console log is just imagine like
28:17 - it's it's you know
28:18 - you're just kind of logging um you know
28:21 - whatever you want
28:22 - yeah so you could just start to in this
28:25 - case just print out things
28:26 - onto the web onto the console to debug
28:30 - if you want so nas was able to make sure
28:31 - and print out snapshot dot
28:34 - docs and then if it shows up in the
28:36 - console you actually
28:37 - see the data in there so what he's doing
28:38 - is he's adding console.log hello
28:40 - see so now you see how it prints out
28:41 - hello and it also prints out
28:43 - the other thing that he's printing which
28:44 - is the snapshot dot dot yes so if you're
28:46 - looking to see
28:47 - what is the actual date inside of a
28:49 - variable or anything like that
28:51 - you can log it with console.log and if
28:54 - you go to the console
28:55 - of your website it'll show you what's
28:57 - actually being
28:58 - printed out or what text exactly exactly
29:00 - so you can see here for example
29:01 - again hello for now here right
29:05 - snapchat.docs print out inside this e
29:08 - portion
29:08 - that's it exactly and as many people are
29:10 - saying in the chat it's kind of like the
29:11 - print version so in java you have
29:13 - system.out.print
29:14 - and c plus plus you have the printf or
29:17 - in t
29:18 - you have you know so in different
29:19 - languages you have different ways of
29:20 - printing this is
29:21 - the one for javascript yes correct so we
29:23 - get the console log high we get the
29:24 - console
29:25 - that's all good now i mean we call the
29:28 - function here but the problem becomes
29:29 - here is that we call the function in the
29:31 - wrong time because you see how we're
29:32 - multi coding multiple times look at this
29:35 - you see we're calling it multiple times
29:37 - uh let me see this console.log save this
29:40 - look
29:41 - like hello hello hello you see that whoa
29:42 - that's bad because
29:44 - this app is kind of refreshed a lot of
29:46 - times so what we do to prevent that is
29:48 - we usually call use effect
29:51 - right with the use effect and what user
29:53 - effect does is pretty simple use effect
29:55 - basically calls this function anything
29:58 - inside of it
29:59 - only when our app is first loaded
30:02 - initialized right so what's going to
30:04 - happen i'm going to use the fact i'm
30:05 - going to do comma
30:06 - right here an array and this means that
30:10 - this right here means that call the
30:12 - function anything that's in here
30:14 - whenever it's initialized so if i say
30:16 - console.log
30:18 - log hello hello
30:22 - i'm you use effect i use effect right
30:26 - there okay so try this out by yourself
30:28 - guys
30:28 - right there this is not defined so this
30:31 - is not defined because we need to import
30:32 - it first so it's going to import that so
30:33 - we'll say
30:34 - so use effect is a function from react
30:38 - yeah you could use and then it gets
30:39 - called every time there's something
30:41 - that's updated correct correct
30:42 - okay exactly perfect react
30:46 - okay yo our boy victor diaz just donated
30:51 - five dollars he said you guys rock let's
30:54 - go
30:55 - oh thank you so much you know his name
30:58 - is the same thing
30:59 - same as joe diaz well but just spell
31:01 - differently
31:03 - i thought it was cool come on bro thank
31:05 - you so much victor appreciate you
31:06 - i appreciate it but look at this look at
31:08 - the difference look look bro look
31:10 - louise if i see that's being called once
31:11 - while hello that was here is being
31:13 - called multiple times and we want to
31:15 - avoid calling you multiple times
31:17 - exactly there's no need to no it's on
31:19 - youtube using the color one exactly
31:20 - so what we're going to do i'm going to
31:21 - remove this hello use effect and i'm
31:23 - going to say get channels i'm going to
31:24 - put this cat channels function into the
31:26 - user effect right here
31:27 - right there right so now if we go ahead
31:30 - and refresh this one more time
31:31 - you see the user fact look at this look
31:34 - at that now it's being called only once
31:36 - nice cool now the question becomes okay
31:39 - this looks weird this does not look like
31:40 - data we need we need to use
31:42 - yes it does not because here's what we
31:43 - need to do we need to call the doc
31:45 - data here's one so for this to work
31:49 - we need to go like this we need to go
31:50 - snapshot
31:52 - shot dot docs dot what
31:56 - the map we're going to loop through
31:57 - every single document this is how
31:59 - we need to loop through it that we're
32:00 - going to look through every single one
32:01 - i'm going to get the doc
32:03 - one doc right here right boom boom boom
32:06 - and then what's going to happen is that
32:08 - we're going to right here console.log
32:11 - for now doc.data
32:15 - for now so again the reason nas says for
32:17 - now is because console.log is a way that
32:19 - we can debug to make sure we get the
32:21 - right data
32:22 - once we've consoled logged in we see
32:23 - that's the right data now we're going to
32:25 - bring it in and look html
32:26 - and look guys check this out name clever
32:28 - programmer that's the one we have right
32:30 - and you see doctor data this is our
32:32 - first our first
32:34 - right our first what room
32:37 - our first and this guy's this comes
32:39 - directly from a firebase database so if
32:40 - we go back to here okay
32:42 - this is our room clever programmer let's
32:44 - create a new room let's call it a new
32:45 - document what should it be called a
32:47 - challenge day challenge so say name
32:50 - challenge react challenge
32:54 - boom right there click save you see now
32:57 - check this out
32:58 - if i go back to my react app oh let's go
33:01 - now we have cover programmer and the
33:02 - reaction this loops through
33:04 - all of our pages or all of the documents
33:07 - all of our documents inside of our if
33:08 - you
33:08 - if you're thinking about the notebook
33:10 - then yes it's pages yes
33:12 - yes pages it's literally going like this
33:14 - it's going it's going like this
33:18 - and so forth and it's actually showing
33:19 - them you see yeah it's cool
33:22 - pretty wild stuff so look at this guys
33:24 - now we have it right there look at
33:25 - that's so cool
33:26 - all right now to do that what we need to
33:28 - do we need to save this data now somehow
33:31 - okay all right save it how do we save it
33:33 - well we're saving into something called
33:35 - you state
33:37 - every component guys this app component
33:40 - has state right has a database what is
33:43 - state
33:44 - it's a database perfect okay
33:47 - sorry i asked you that i answered it
33:50 - keep doing that
33:51 - okay so it's a database okay so imagine
33:54 - this
33:54 - app component has its own database and
33:57 - you can kind of add data to
33:58 - it now how do we use it how do we use it
34:01 - bro
34:01 - tell me um use state
34:04 - use state well first we need to import
34:07 - it so let's go ahead and import use
34:09 - state so this is another function of
34:12 - react
34:12 - yes you can use another function react
34:14 - use state right there
34:16 - and use state has two things that allows
34:19 - to do it has
34:20 - the value itself and the function to to
34:23 - change it so here's what's gonna happen
34:25 - i will say here okay i'm gonna say it
34:28 - like this
34:28 - okay i will say it like this let me go
34:31 - to close this for now
34:32 - well i will say like that um
34:36 - i will say const let me go do that const
34:40 - const and i will say rooms comma
34:44 - set rooms is equal to
34:47 - use state state and i will pass
34:51 - in the array in here you see that yep
34:54 - all right
34:55 - so here's how that works use state
34:58 - imagine it's creating a new uh kind of a
35:01 - new database
35:02 - and it's creating a see a new
35:06 - database for this component called just
35:07 - the app component and it's adding a new
35:10 - section in here and this section the
35:12 - data for this section
35:13 - actually is the rooms right now this
35:17 - function right here is actually what's
35:18 - going to be able to change the data
35:20 - that's in here
35:21 - this changes the data that rooms
35:23 - function so we actually get two things
35:25 - back
35:26 - now to use that what's going to happen
35:28 - whenever you see remember how we did
35:30 - console.data well look at this
35:33 - we are going to do set rooms
35:37 - we're going to save the rooms okay set
35:39 - rooms
35:40 - on snapchat.map and what's going to
35:43 - happen is that we're going to return
35:46 - here return
35:49 - doc dot data why we return because
35:53 - when we return in here when we return in
35:56 - here
35:57 - let me see if it's all good yeah just
35:58 - add another parentheses where
36:00 - uh we're done with the red so you just
36:04 - add the yeah oh this one right here
36:05 - thank you boom there i almost forget
36:08 - that i don't know why
36:09 - so when we return right let's go ahead
36:11 - and refresh this good when we turned out
36:12 - the data it's going to return the data
36:15 - for every single element and when i do
36:17 - set rooms it's going to save the data
36:18 - inside the rooms function
36:20 - so find out do let's go ahead and do
36:21 - console.log
36:24 - log rooms look at this
36:28 - console.log rooms are we ready for this
36:30 - are you ready for this bro
36:31 - inspect element console and look at that
36:35 - rooms now has two two
36:38 - array object two obvious headers to be
36:40 - the ones we have in our database exactly
36:42 - guys
36:43 - how cool is that right one is cochlear
36:46 - programmer and otherwise called react.js
36:48 - challenge direct challenge
36:49 - right and that's inside the room so this
36:51 - right here is actually maps out to this
36:53 - perfect boom right there now beautiful
36:55 - but we're not done yet
36:56 - before because of the thing we also need
36:58 - to be able to get the unique id
37:00 - because we'll use nikodi to be able to
37:01 - change different rooms like when we go
37:03 - ahead and change it for rooms right so
37:04 - we need to get the unique id
37:06 - to do that here's what we'll do guys but
37:08 - decided to return.data
37:10 - we'll do return we'll create the object
37:13 - okay and we'll say here id doc.id
37:18 - doc.id okay comma
37:22 - name is doc dot data
37:27 - data dot name
37:31 - boom that name how's the house that
37:33 - being mapped out pretty simple guys
37:35 - that name let's go ahead and close this
37:37 - out that name is being mapped out from
37:39 - here this that name
37:40 - we get from the name that's in here you
37:42 - see that yep and so this cloud report
37:44 - will have
37:44 - this and then the id is gonna be the id
37:46 - of the document itself
37:48 - except can you go to firebase real quick
37:50 - to show them where the idea is yes right
37:51 - here so id this is how you do right here
37:54 - now we have a unique id correct or
37:57 - whatever data we have inside of this
37:58 - yeah so this id
37:59 - is going to be actually inside here so
38:02 - remember this
38:03 - dc4eli you see that right there check
38:05 - this out
38:06 - now because we're returning the id and
38:07 - we're saving it inside the rooms
38:09 - okay what's going to happen now is we go
38:11 - to here
38:12 - and if we refresh right right for this
38:15 - and we can select rooms
38:16 - now you have two items nice and we don't
38:19 - have the id
38:20 - um i didn't save it
38:24 - if i refresh it are you ready bro oh oh
38:27 - oh let's go remember how we had the
38:31 - e yep right there for e boom
38:34 - now what's the purpose of an id i don't
38:37 - you tell me
38:38 - while the id is completely unique so if
38:40 - you happen to create another channel
38:43 - with the same names react slap dash
38:46 - challenge it totally fine because you
38:48 - have a different identifier for that
38:51 - so ids are going to be very common when
38:53 - it comes to back end development
38:54 - because that is how you can uniquely
38:56 - identify a specific
38:58 - item or a specific record if you're
39:01 - looking at relational databases of
39:03 - course
39:03 - yes yes yes yes so this is a very
39:06 - important aspect of coding just in
39:07 - general okay guys
39:08 - so look now we got the ids cool all
39:12 - right
39:12 - we got the ids nice job all right we got
39:14 - that portion
39:15 - let's go and save that that's so good
39:17 - all right that's the start
39:19 - okay pardos what's part of those bro
39:22 - part two is we want to create them from
39:25 - the app now
39:26 - yes exactly well let's actually show
39:28 - them we have the rooms
39:30 - that's in here we have our app
39:33 - that's in here we have our channels that
39:36 - are here but these are not
39:38 - channels from where these are not
39:40 - channels from the database these are
39:42 - ones that we
39:43 - hard script right into or hardwired into
39:46 - our code
39:47 - exactly and we don't want that because
39:48 - then you can't really change it
39:50 - because that's what it's going to show
39:51 - every time someone logs in let's go
39:53 - you got that right my friend so what we
39:56 - are going to do
39:56 - is instead of these ideas we're going to
39:58 - replace them with database ids you ready
40:00 - for this bro yes sir
40:01 - you tell me how to do it all right go do
40:04 - it
40:06 - so we have rooms in here the really cool
40:08 - part is because we have rooms in the app
40:10 - we can actually pass it down to guys to
40:12 - multiple components
40:13 - we can pass down data between components
40:15 - between
40:16 - different you know objects different you
40:18 - know containers
40:20 - so in our case we have rooms let's pass
40:23 - down rooms
40:24 - into the chat so inside the ch uh no not
40:27 - chat
40:27 - sidebar because our rooms are where
40:30 - they're inside the sidebar you see that
40:31 - right there our channels
40:32 - so inside the sidebar we'll say rooms
40:35 - it's kind of like arguments in the
40:36 - function
40:37 - rooms is equal to rooms
40:41 - rooms right there now we're passing down
40:43 - data from
40:44 - app.js down to where
40:49 - the sidebar sidebar.yes exactly
40:52 - okay now inside the sidebar we have to
40:54 - now take it you have to accept it now
40:56 - how do we do that well
40:59 - it's something called props guys props
41:02 - right every component has props
41:06 - imagine like a parameters so if i do
41:09 - props in my case let's do console props
41:11 - again
41:11 - being consoled log very important aspect
41:14 - and so the log props
41:16 - props right there okay save that
41:20 - inspect them on the chat right here
41:22 - console okay
41:23 - see clear this out refresh it
41:27 - look at that now if i props look at that
41:28 - you see props the props has a room
41:31 - argument with an array that we passed
41:33 - 10.
41:33 - perfect boom boom so props stands for
41:38 - properties correct properties and those
41:39 - would be the properties of a specific
41:41 - component
41:42 - exactly so that is how you're able to
41:43 - pass in arguments parameters whatever
41:45 - language you've been used to before if
41:47 - you're not and just that's just how you
41:48 - pass in data
41:50 - from one place to another place yes
41:52 - exactly all right now this props has a
41:54 - actual room so we can use that attribute
41:56 - okay ready for this bro
41:58 - are you ready for this bro i am ready i
42:00 - hope you read this bro i'm watching okay
42:02 - now to loop through props
42:04 - just how we loop through data in here
42:05 - guys we will do the same thing for
42:07 - channels here's what we'll do
42:09 - i'm gonna create i'm gonna use a jsx
42:12 - functionality and we'll do props
42:16 - props the rooms the map
42:20 - to loop through it that map right and
42:22 - we'll say item
42:23 - that's for every single one room okay
42:25 - this is going to get us one room
42:27 - and this will return what this will
42:28 - return
42:30 - this channel so it's going to copy this
42:32 - channel boom
42:34 - and we'll paste the channel in here
42:36 - right there
42:37 - now so this returns one channel
42:40 - component one little channel style style
42:41 - component see that right there yep
42:43 - now how do we actually put the item data
42:46 - into here
42:48 - well it depends what data do we want
42:50 - from the item well the one that we want
42:51 - is the name
42:52 - oh so usually pretty much when you're
42:54 - trying to access an attribute of an
42:56 - object
42:57 - we're going to do the object dot the
43:00 - attribute name yes we'll use dot
43:01 - notation so as we'll do
43:02 - we'll use something like this we'll use
43:04 - like this and we'll do
43:06 - item dot name
43:09 - boom right there and now we can do let's
43:11 - kind of remove this channel right here
43:13 - boom boom boom what's going to happen
43:15 - now is it's going to loop through every
43:17 - single
43:18 - rooms object that we have in the
43:21 - database
43:22 - it's going to get grab that one object
43:23 - it's going to put that and create a new
43:25 - channel just
43:26 - like that how sick is that you ready for
43:27 - this bro i'm ready oh
43:30 - hold on oh my god sorry see if i heal
43:33 - too loud
43:34 - and look at this as i scroll down ready
43:36 - ready
43:37 - oh let's go
43:54 - this is how it's done guys are you still
43:56 - pumped with me guys
43:58 - 269 likes guys let's get to
44:01 - 300 300 300
44:06 - likes right now
44:09 - i know you guys got this 300 likes come
44:11 - on let's go right now we just get
44:14 - did our first part with database you
44:15 - just entered my database guys
44:17 - you implemented a database how sick is
44:20 - that
44:21 - all right so moving
44:24 - forward right just to recap what
44:26 - happened here
44:27 - right we this this stuff right here is
44:30 - coming from a database directly react
44:31 - challenge
44:32 - and look at this if i now add one more
44:34 - let's do one more what
44:36 - what should we add now um do this one
44:40 - team nas and daniel team knowles and
44:42 - daniel
44:45 - [Laughter]
44:48 - team daniel
44:52 - daniel right there team nothing daniel
44:55 - save that
44:55 - look at that now that's satan here are
44:57 - you ready for this bro
44:59 - i have this do it oh
45:02 - let's go team nas and then because our
45:04 - application is now actually going to
45:06 - firebase getting the data and then
45:08 - putting it
45:09 - on the channels and because it's
45:10 - firebase guys it's real time
45:12 - so whenever you are whenever you are
45:15 - updating something in the database
45:16 - what's going to happen is this gets run
45:19 - again
45:19 - and this is why we have an update
45:21 - instantaneously i did not even have to
45:23 - refresh
45:24 - my page it's called real time database
45:27 - guys real time
45:28 - remember that important importante
45:32 - all right so we got that part two that
45:35 - we're going to create for today
45:37 - is how to now add a new channel so
45:39 - here's part two how to add a new channel
45:40 - yes from your slack
45:41 - yes add a new channel from slack clone
45:46 - because we saw we could go to firebase
45:47 - and add it there but that doesn't make
45:49 - sense yes
45:49 - yes yes yes yes yes yes something said
45:52 - isn't it due to the usefx statement no
45:54 - not necessarily guys
45:55 - the reason why we don't have to refresh
45:58 - is because
45:59 - this to be the collection is a real time
46:01 - is a web it's got a web hook actually
46:03 - it's called uh yeah and what's happening
46:05 - is that
46:06 - every time inside inside the snapshot
46:08 - right here every time the firebase gets
46:10 - updated
46:10 - it hits it hits this function no
46:15 - basically tells this function to run
46:17 - again and this runs again
46:19 - so that's how cool it is all right cool
46:21 - awesome
46:22 - to create a new channel we'll do a few
46:25 - things
46:26 - we have our sidebar let's now go to chat
46:28 - g uh
46:31 - where am i at inside the sidebar let's
46:34 - create a
46:34 - function called add channel
46:38 - let's do that let's do it so say const
46:41 - add
46:41 - channel is equal to the following
46:48 - okay add channels that's a function okay
46:50 - now so this function how do we end the
46:52 - channels that's the big question
46:54 - well are we gonna want to update the
46:56 - list um
46:58 - well yes but also need to call database
47:00 - as well because the database has the
47:02 - actual data not just the list that's
47:04 - inside of our application exactly
47:06 - so let's go ahead and do that so add
47:07 - channel and here we'll do the following
47:09 - we'll do
47:10 - db we'll well the first thing is we need
47:12 - to prompt the user for the channel so
47:14 - we'll say const
47:15 - prompt name prompt
47:18 - name is equal to prompt
47:24 - prompt and we'll call it
47:27 - enter channel name
47:31 - boom channel name right there okay now
47:34 - the console.log
47:36 - prompt name prompt
47:40 - name right there problem name because
47:42 - you ready for this bro yep
47:44 - so we can solo log prompt name now
47:48 - from there how do we actually call this
47:51 - function
47:53 - well we're going to want to call it
47:55 - whenever the user takes an action
47:57 - to add a channel where well i'm assuming
48:00 - it's a little plus sign right there
48:01 - [Music]
48:03 - you know it bro you know it you know it
48:07 - bro that's what i'm talking about
48:08 - so if we look at the plus where's our
48:12 - plus icon
48:12 - it's actually here and i cross second
48:15 - okay
48:16 - now for this first second to work here
48:18 - we'll do we can do an unclick function
48:20 - unclick and we're gonna do on click
48:24 - unclick equals and we simply call
48:28 - add channel this is the power
48:32 - off react js
48:35 - my friends okay i can call functions on
48:37 - the click of anything i want
48:40 - click anything i want i can do that so
48:43 - add channel save this and you're ready
48:46 - for this bro
48:47 - yeah oh and if i
48:50 - click okay so it's cancelled for now i
48:53 - will say inspect element
48:54 - because we're logging something yes as
48:56 - long as something
48:58 - plus oh
49:02 - okay oh this is our prompt we just put
49:04 - in you see so now we have the actual
49:06 - information
49:06 - and you have to access it exactly and
49:08 - you exactly know why now
49:10 - console.log is so important because it's
49:11 - a great way for us to test things
49:13 - exactly okay cool so we're prompting
49:16 - that
49:16 - okay let's go ahead and save that so
49:18 - after that we need to be able to save
49:20 - that
49:20 - in our database so we'll say
49:23 - if if channel if prompt
49:27 - name prompt
49:31 - name exists okay if it's not null if it
49:34 - actually exists if people suddenly put
49:35 - something in it
49:36 - db.collection and
49:39 - we'll say to get the rooms collection
49:40 - again instead of now doing on snapshot
49:43 - we will do
49:44 - the add and then the ad
49:48 - will give it an object and this object
49:50 - will be named
49:52 - what is it prompt aim
49:57 - all right so look db undefined
50:00 - okay why is it imported no it's not
50:03 - so we gotta do like this we'll say
50:05 - import
50:06 - db from now i need to import from
50:09 - database
50:10 - so we gotta go back like this and say
50:12 - firebase
50:13 - firebase boom boom right there the
50:16 - reason why we say this guys is becomes
50:18 - because cyber.js is inside the
50:20 - components you see this right here
50:21 - sidebar is here our firebase isn't
50:26 - is outside the components folder so this
50:28 - right here
50:29 - goes outside the components folder and
50:31 - goes into the firebase.js
50:34 - that's how that works beautiful all
50:36 - right
50:37 - we got that portion beautiful
50:40 - whew let's go got that portion now let's
50:43 - test it out
50:45 - a channel is being called test out this
50:47 - function
50:48 - okay uno dos stress you ready for this
50:50 - let's do it plus
50:52 - okay what should we call it uh
50:56 - we work we are
50:59 - cool we're pretty cool yeah we're pretty
51:01 - cool i'll say so quick
51:02 - okay
51:07 - go to firebase let's make sure it's
51:08 - actually down here and we're not lying
51:09 - to them hold on
51:10 - oh right
51:14 - right so now we have the ability to get
51:17 - the data from firebase
51:18 - and add data yes
51:22 - get us to 300 likes for that guys
51:25 - 294 likes come on guys you guys got this
51:28 - come on that's just six more likes
51:29 - i think i think this deserves six more
51:32 - let's deserve six more likes guys we're
51:33 - almost there like
51:34 - six more likes and we've already done so
51:36 - much like holy holy crap
51:38 - what oh wait 295 i was looking at the
51:40 - wrong 295 oh you're looking at mom
51:43 - 2.95 come on 289 and we are at
51:50 - [Music]
51:55 - 300
51:58 - oh man you guys are epic cool all right
52:00 - so
52:01 - uh at this point on this one
52:06 - danielle
52:08 - [Music]
52:17 - holy crap oh come on bro you know that
52:19 - you know the drill
52:20 - [Laughter]
52:22 - every time we pause and that's what's
52:24 - the volume up we gotta dance i think
52:25 - this and every time it's like people are
52:27 - like pumped let's go we did it let's go
52:31 - i'm so freaking pumped
52:34 - oh it's amazing cool all right
52:37 - look at this so again the way this kind
52:39 - of works guys is i just want to kind of
52:40 - give you around on the way it works okay
52:42 - if i go ahead and do my text tool let's
52:44 - say we have uh
52:46 - let me go ahead and do force mode on so
52:49 - we have firebase in here
52:51 - firebase and we have our app in here
52:53 - right this is our app okay
52:55 - and what's going to happen is that let's
52:57 - say we have the new message
53:00 - new message okay or let's say new
53:02 - channel my bad
53:03 - new channel okay this is how that works
53:07 - so new channel is being added
53:09 - okay if i not do brush tool whenever you
53:11 - add a new channel guys
53:13 - that gives it to database firebase right
53:15 - this is why
53:16 - within firebase we see the actual
53:18 - channel the firebase tell the app that
53:20 - we have an update
53:22 - and an app then shows us
53:26 - view and the app then shows it to us on
53:29 - the view
53:32 - and this is the process and it's a
53:34 - continuous circle it's a continuous
53:35 - circle non-stop
53:37 - new channel new data updates a database
53:40 - database updates the app up updates
53:43 - the view boom voila and the reason we
53:46 - have firebase again is so that we could
53:48 - store this data for a long period of
53:50 - time because if you have a chat
53:51 - conversation or a new channel
53:53 - you don't want it to just disappear the
53:55 - next time you log in you want it to be
53:56 - there and remain there so you need to
53:58 - store it into a firebase database to do
54:00 - that persistent storage it's called
54:01 - persistent storage guys
54:03 - ah okay moving forward
54:07 - we are going to do the following thing
54:10 - let's work on the chat now
54:14 - this is the fun part the fun part guys
54:16 - now
54:17 - we work on the chat so let's go to
54:20 - app.gs
54:21 - okay at the gs okay
54:24 - actually let's go not to add the js
54:25 - let's go to chat.gs
54:27 - this is what we're working on from now
54:29 - from the let's point out all right
54:31 - chatterjee is going to have a few things
54:32 - so if we look at our app that we we are
54:34 - trying to build
54:35 - okay what do we have daniel well we have
54:38 - something that kind of gives the channel
54:40 - summary
54:41 - we have a header and i have a header
54:42 - right there a channel header okay what
54:44 - else do we have
54:45 - we have uh input right there and what
54:47 - else do we have inside here the
54:49 - text area the text area guys so
54:52 - you can see there's three components
54:53 - that we need to build guys kind of three
54:54 - components that we need to go ahead and
54:56 - build
54:57 - this one uh
55:00 - this one this one
55:04 - and this one that's it okay
55:07 - so let's do that inside our component
55:10 - it's going to create the container the
55:11 - container is going to contain everything
55:12 - inside the chat so it's a container
55:18 - let me close this out i don't need this
55:20 - anymore
55:22 - container and for this one for the
55:25 - container
55:26 - we'll close this out right here so that
55:28 - you don't have that good container
55:30 - import style because i'm going to use
55:31 - stock opponent so i'll say import
55:34 - styled from what from styled
55:38 - dash components yo nas check it out
55:42 - what we have another lovely person who
55:45 - just sent
55:46 - us five dollars we have you thank you so
55:49 - much
55:50 - we love the dancing pair that you have
55:52 - there it's trying to copyright dance
55:53 - moves look at that oh let's go guys
55:55 - if you guys copy our dance moves guys
55:57 - tag us on instagram

56:04 - thank you so much pete we greatly
56:06 - appreciate you and everyone else
56:08 - watching this yes
56:09 - so we have the container here somebody
56:11 - said check it in if you want to call the
56:12 - jacket container that's fine completely
56:14 - no problem
56:15 - okay let's go we'll use style components
56:17 - and we'll do const
56:18 - container as you guys know the drill now
56:20 - we do styled
56:22 - that div okay that's all okay
56:25 - inside the container what's going to
56:27 - happen well we have three components
56:28 - right
56:29 - first one is going to be what the first
56:30 - is going to be the
56:32 - the header so we'll say we'll give it
56:34 - the header section
56:38 - we'll go to the header section then
56:40 - underneath the header section what are
56:41 - we going to have
56:42 - the chat area the message we'll say the
56:44 - message container message container
56:46 - we'll say message container right there
56:49 - cool then i need the message container
56:51 - what are we going to have the
56:53 - input chat area yes we'll call it the
56:56 - chat input chat input
56:59 - right there boom okay chat input now
57:03 - okay now this message let's go ahead and
57:05 - comment this production now we don't
57:06 - need this just yet
57:08 - okay okay container now inside the
57:11 - header what's going to happen inside the
57:12 - ah
57:13 - no no no bad bad bad bad bad but this
57:15 - guy is right here my bad
57:17 - is inside it's after the header right
57:19 - here not bad oh
57:20 - yeah yeah because we want the container
57:23 - yes
57:24 - to give it styled uh component to
57:27 - everything
57:27 - yeah exactly so let me go ahead and put
57:29 - that back to here my bad side one
57:31 - you you need me to put this after the
57:33 - header
57:34 - or right there so you have the message
57:36 - container after the header
57:37 - and the chat input after message
57:38 - container so those three components just
57:40 - how we showed it before okay
57:42 - so i'm going to show it so you see boom
57:44 - right there
57:46 - this gonna be here this gonna be here
57:50 - this then this right here is gonna be
57:52 - this one
57:53 - comprende wait what's this area what let
57:56 - me go ahead hey
57:58 - let's go wait thank you close me yeah
58:00 - [Laughter]
58:03 - all right we got that portion uh let's
58:06 - go ahead and do
58:07 - now create it so we'll say const const
58:10 - header
58:12 - is equal to styled dot div
58:15 - dot diff boom okay nothing so far okay
58:18 - nothing so far
58:19 - then same because kits will say const
58:22 - message
58:24 - message container is equal to what
58:29 - styled dot just keep that in mind right
58:32 - it's it's a pattern you see the pattern
58:34 - here
58:34 - as part of the video developer guys you
58:36 - have to remember patterns patterns are
58:37 - very important to become a developer
58:39 - right
58:39 - this is the key always now we do have a
58:41 - question that was saying
58:42 - we seem to be putting all these style
58:44 - components after the
58:46 - export uh rd lewic is asking if this is
58:49 - a standard
58:50 - or if you could put it above the return
58:51 - function or where is the best place to
58:53 - put these
58:54 - so it's actually it's actually very good
58:57 - to put it
58:58 - underneath the export there's nothing
58:59 - wrong with that whatsoever because
59:01 - when javascript reads the file it reads
59:03 - the whole file the export just simply
59:05 - a way for like it allows the chat to be
59:08 - exported that's pretty much
59:09 - it but when javascript goes in and sees
59:11 - this header and knows this header is
59:13 - actually
59:14 - this of course of course so so i think
59:17 - it's
59:18 - cool putting on the bottom because it
59:19 - kind of separates your code out so you
59:21 - know
59:21 - everything after the export is going to
59:24 - be styled components and everything
59:25 - before it's going to be your actual
59:27 - component
59:27 - exactly correct correct so we have the
59:29 - message container now let's go do a chat
59:31 - input for now
59:32 - const chat input yeah so great question
59:35 - by the way if you have
59:36 - more of those questions keep on asking
59:37 - them because we want to give you guys as
59:38 - much value as possible beautiful start
59:40 - the day
59:41 - all right we got the header we've got
59:43 - the message container we've got the chat
59:45 - input no problem
59:46 - all right if you go to our react app of
59:48 - course there's nothing here guys as you
59:49 - know right
59:50 - if i go to header right there's pretty
59:52 - much nothing here so
59:54 - now to actually make those full things
59:55 - work um
59:57 - remember how i used grid before we're
59:59 - going to use grid here too
60:01 - check this out grid is going what's
60:03 - going to split it up into three rows
60:05 - three rows okay so look at this
60:07 - container and i will say display grid in
60:09 - here
60:11 - display grid
60:14 - okay boom display grid all right
60:17 - now to define three rows guys we're
60:20 - going to use
60:21 - grid template rosa
60:24 - rose grid templars so we'll say grid
60:28 - template rows like so
60:32 - and to define every row we give it a
60:35 - height a height for the tumblers
60:39 - the height for our first row so this is
60:41 - our first
60:43 - second and third row
60:46 - our first row height is going to be 64
60:48 - pixels that's going to be the header 64
60:50 - pixels
60:52 - our second row is actually going to be
60:54 - auto
60:56 - why because our second row was the
60:58 - message container right
61:00 - it's the massive containers with this
61:01 - portion and that's going to expand
61:03 - if the height if the slack is bigger the
61:06 - master creation is going to get bigger
61:07 - does that make sense
61:08 - that makes total sense yes exactly and
61:10 - then the third row
61:11 - the third row is going to be something
61:13 - called min content
61:17 - meaning meaning meaning this portion
61:19 - right here
61:21 - this third row is going to take up as
61:23 - much space as a minimum as it needs
61:26 - so if the height of this input box is
61:28 - this much that's going that's going to
61:30 - be the height of the row
61:31 - makes sense that makes sense good
61:33 - awesome good
61:34 - let's continue on so we got this portion
61:36 - let's go ahead and go to the header now
61:38 - and if we look at the header if i do
61:39 - background color for example background
61:41 - color
61:43 - what what gabriel just donated
61:48 - two euros telling us please dad bro
61:55 - are you serious bro dude i guess we're
61:57 - monkeys bro hold on bro
61:59 - just give him give it give we'll wait
62:00 - for the beat drop wait for the beat drop
62:01 - bro all right we'll wait for that for
62:02 - the beat
62:04 - back we're about to do we come here to
62:07 - code if we come here to dance bro
62:09 - gabriel we're here to code man but we'll
62:11 - do it
62:12 - so background thank you we'll say orange
62:14 - right there
62:16 - okay save that look at this you see we
62:18 - defined look at this bro see
62:20 - define the header right there see and
62:22 - now it's orange
62:24 - because we give it a temporary 64 pixel
62:26 - height
62:27 - voila and now our message container if
62:30 - we do that let's say
62:31 - uh let's see background color
62:35 - background we can say gray
62:40 - see because our message continued is
62:42 - auto and this is
62:44 - and our chat input is just mint content
62:46 - and because we don't have anything there
62:47 - right now that content
62:48 - is zero exactly so let's go ahead and
62:50 - remove this great icon we don't need
62:51 - this anymore
62:52 - at all we don't need this background
62:55 - orange instead inside the header we'll
62:56 - we'll create the content and what
63:00 - and what content do we have here you
63:02 - gotta do it for

66:04 - here yeah yeah so
66:05 - channel so now let's go ahead and do
66:07 - this right
66:09 - let's create this section right here
66:10 - this section is going to be called
66:11 - channel okay and then
66:13 - and then this channel has two sections
66:15 - one is this section right here
66:16 - and then second section is this section
66:18 - right here details okay
66:20 - so say this one's gonna be channel
66:22 - section and then and after that we're
66:24 - gonna be channel details
66:27 - channel details right here one right
66:29 - there
66:30 - all right let's create a style that
66:31 - there for both of those so here we'll
66:33 - say
66:33 - channel const channel
66:37 - is equal to by the way guys if you
66:38 - actually are spamming if you're saying
66:40 -  like spam
66:41 - we're gonna block you and you won't be
66:42 - able to watch this anymore just so you
66:44 - know okay
66:45 - i don't like that he doesn't like it
66:47 - nobody likes it it only makes it works
66:48 - for everybody
66:49 - so if you say bad stuff if you spam
66:53 - i'm not even gonna be sad about it i'm
66:55 - just gonna block you i'm gonna throw you
66:56 - out
66:56 - guys we want productive conversations
66:59 - things are going to move
67:00 - people forward not things that are going
67:02 - to hold everyone else back and distract
67:04 - people so guys keep it clean keep it
67:05 - positive
67:06 - motivate others motivate yourself let's
67:08 - be productive yeah
67:09 - so channel now is the channel details so
67:13 - const channel details right there is
67:16 - also going to be style that do
67:18 - is equal to styled that div right there
67:22 - okay good it's not the div awesome after
67:25 - that
67:26 - after that is what's going to happen
67:29 - okay if i go to here now nothing is
67:32 - there of course no problem that's okay
67:34 - now inside the channel it's gonna be two
67:36 - things one's gonna be the channel name
67:39 - channel name channel info that's going
67:42 - to be that this box right here this
67:44 - company one announcement it's kind of
67:45 - information about the channel itself
67:47 - so we'll say then we'll say channel info
67:51 - boom right there channel
67:54 - info now none of those are available so
67:57 - let's create those right now
67:59 - so enhanced channel name
68:03 - is equal to style.div
68:06 - okay and then const
68:10 - channel info is equal to what styled
68:14 - that div as well boom
68:17 - boom done now hashtag clever is there
68:19 - for the channel info we'll go we'll do
68:21 - this one now so we'll
68:22 - accompany with announcements so you guys
68:23 - can place that into yourself as well
68:25 - so do company with announcements all
68:27 - right booed and you can see there's
68:29 - nothing
68:30 - interesting or crazy that's in here okay
68:32 - that
68:33 - not the most important thing but what's
68:35 - going to happen is that
68:37 - we now can actually modify and modify
68:39 - the styling of this right
68:40 - so let's think about now the channel the
68:43 - channel itself okay
68:46 - the channel itself the channel name will
68:49 - give it a font weight of
68:50 - of what or font weight of 700. yeah
68:52 - something big something that's
68:54 - noticeable exactly so font weight
68:58 - want weight of 700 so that's the weight
69:01 - of
69:01 - of uh what's it called found by 700 okay
69:04 - cool all right
69:05 - refresh this good it's almost 700 now
69:08 - for the channel info
69:10 - let's change it up as well and for this
69:12 - one we'll give it a
69:13 - font width of 400 right there
69:16 - font weight of 400 okay good
69:20 - okay and then we'll say give it a
69:23 - different color we'll definitely we'll
69:24 - give it give it a color of the following
69:25 - it's gonna be six zero six zero six zero
69:30 - this is a very lightweight like gray
69:32 - right there guys you see and we're going
69:34 - to make a fun side we're going to make a
69:35 - smaller font size with a font size
69:37 - of 13 pixels okay
69:41 - and then we'll do margin top desktop
69:44 - and that's going to be what 8 pixels
69:48 - right okay look at this right there see
69:51 - now that's there that's there
69:52 - now all good right but here's the
69:54 - problem but here's the problem
69:56 - right now we need to add some spacing
69:59 - here and here and how do we do that
70:01 - margin and padding
70:02 - hey now should we use module should we
70:04 - use padding it's a good question
70:06 - i think we're going to use padding on
70:07 - this one because we would want the
70:08 - header to cover the entire top
70:10 - yes exactly so let's go ahead and use
70:12 - padding in our case
70:14 - we're adding the header section you see
70:16 - this header section so let's do this
70:18 - we'll give it a padding left inside the
70:20 - header where's the header right there
70:22 - see this header
70:23 - we'll give it a padding left so go to
70:25 - the header we'll say padding left
70:27 - and we'll give it 20 pixels right there
70:30 - done you see now good next up
70:34 - let's give this one also a penny right
70:36 - of 20 pixels as well
70:38 - padding right 20 pixels
70:41 - now because we know the header is 64
70:45 - pixels height
70:46 - we need to center it now now how do we
70:47 - do that check this out i will use
70:49 - display flex
70:51 - display flex right so
70:54 - flex okay and inside here display
70:58 - flex of course now it's kind of like
70:59 - right it's still fine no problem
71:01 - display flex oop i want that display
71:04 - flex
71:04 - all still good now in display flex of
71:06 - the header
71:07 - i will give it how do i align it
71:09 - vertically centered
71:10 - tell me i think we've done this a couple
71:13 - times
71:14 - uh-huh was this the grid yeah huh it was
71:17 - a great
71:18 - no actually it's not the good news not
71:19 - the grid no because flex is what
71:21 - left to right right no flax is just oh
71:24 - align items there we go
71:26 - there's so many alignment things man
71:28 - it's it's hard to keep it on top of mind
71:30 - line items items center right there
71:35 - save that right there and look at that
71:38 - now it's centered
71:39 - boom right there boom okay

75:46 - absolute position
75:47 - and relative position no that's not
75:48 - right all right well we did that before
75:50 - but i guess we're not going to do that
75:52 - [Laughter]
75:53 - we also did something with grids
75:55 - no it's not right so here's what we'll
75:57 - do we'll go
75:59 - we will go to go ahead in order we'll go
76:01 - to header
76:03 - and we will actually use justify content
76:06 - to push
76:07 - these away from each other you see
76:10 - the header is this whole thing you see
76:14 - and i can actually push these components
76:16 - away from each other by doing by doing
76:17 - something called
76:18 - justify content space between justify
76:20 - content
76:22 - content space
76:26 - between boom
76:29 - oh you see that beautiful
76:33 - as always as always now one more thing i
76:36 - have for you bro
76:38 - how do we change yo you said the last
76:40 - one was the last test bro
76:41 - [Laughter]
76:42 - how do we change the color of this color
76:45 - color
76:46 - we just changed the color guys i like
76:47 - how it says position says absolute
76:49 - positioning
76:49 - not necessarily guys so let's go ahead
76:51 - and change the color of this thank you
76:53 - so thank you frankie we love you so to
76:56 - change the color of this
76:58 - we'll go to channel details
77:01 - in here and
77:05 - we'll give it this color right here
77:09 - right there boom save that look at that
77:12 - now this color
77:13 - is a channel color right there and same
77:16 - as goes for
77:17 - which color same goes for that actually
77:20 - icon color but
77:21 - here's my issue bro you know my issue is
77:23 - what's your issue bro but here she has
77:25 - this
77:25 - these details icon are very close to
77:26 - each other should we
77:28 - add some spacing in between wow um can
77:31 - we add some padding
77:33 - we can add some padding you can also add
77:34 - some margin but the problem is that you
77:36 - see this icon
77:38 - is an icon how do i add marge to this
77:40 - icon
77:41 - pay attention really closely what i'm
77:43 - doing about do here
77:44 - i'm going to create a new component
77:46 - called info
77:48 - okay info right there okay
77:52 - then with this component i will go down
77:54 - and i'm going to say the following
77:55 - i will say here const info
77:59 - pay attention is equal to styled but not
78:02 - style.div
78:04 - instead it's styled info
78:07 - outlined component instead i'm saying
78:10 - it's styled
78:12 - this icon right here what's gonna happen
78:15 - is this
78:16 - basically imports the icon itself and i
78:20 - can apply css style to that icon
78:22 - individually so all the previous
78:23 - stylings that it had
78:24 - before you can build upon those exactly
78:27 - so
78:28 - i'll can anna do something like for
78:29 - example margin
78:31 - right i can say margin right uh margin
78:34 - left actually
78:36 - and i can give the margin left off
78:40 - 10 pixels oh right there
78:43 - and look at this now i know there's two
78:45 - icons now i know no
78:46 - no no but if i remove this one the
78:48 - original one
78:50 - boom save that boom right there
78:54 - and this icon now has inspect element
78:56 - look at this this icon now has
78:59 - this icon has all the previous stuff
79:03 - plus
79:03 - margin left 10 pixels boom right there
79:06 - see
79:07 - right there maps too
79:10 - boom you want to create beautiful
79:15 - cs you want to create beautiful style
79:17 - components
79:18 - these are the things that you need to
79:19 - learn yeah something ask wanna add the
79:22 - details
79:22 - we can also add the details that's your
79:24 - that's up to you guys i decided because
79:26 - i wanted to show you how
79:27 - style components work i decided to do it
79:29 - this way that was just the only issue
79:31 - but you can also edit the details
79:32 - it was more for learning purposes more
79:34 - for learning purposes exactly now we
79:35 - have details we have this and this looks
79:36 - pretty good i would say so
79:38 - it looks amazing it's amazing okay cool
79:40 - next up next up
79:41 - is going to be what wow um let's go
79:45 - it's gonna be this one right here hmm
79:48 - okay are you ready bro let's do it okay
79:53 - okay now for the chat
79:57 - the message container not necessarily
79:59 - the most important thing
80:01 - let's go ahead and do the chat input
80:04 - for this chat input though i'm not going
80:06 - to use the style components guys instead
80:08 - of that
80:09 - instead i'm going to create its own
80:10 - component because it's going to have a
80:11 - lot of functionality within it
80:12 - okay okay so let's do this inside of
80:16 - components let's
80:17 - components call a new file and we'll
80:18 - call it chat input
80:22 - dot gs right there jump with the js okay
80:25 - let's do rfc to create the component rfc
80:28 - rfc is a shortcut
80:30 - shortcut right there okay we create a
80:31 - component
80:33 - save that component let's go back to our
80:37 - where was it chat back to our chat let's
80:40 - import that chat input so i'll say
80:42 - import
80:44 - import right there oh that's nice i want
80:47 - that
80:48 - import chat input
80:52 - input input
80:55 - and put from
80:59 - and we'll say chat input right there
81:02 - there because this directly comes from
81:04 - where
81:05 - input right there see okay
81:09 - now we're gonna replace this with
81:12 - chat input
81:15 - boom right there okay we can now remove
81:18 - this one right here we don't need this
81:19 - anymore
81:20 - okay okay and now we have this an input
81:24 - now inside this one
81:25 - let's go to login up not just input yep
81:29 - and we'll say chat input
81:32 - if i save this go to react
81:35 - oh let's go now that is here you see
81:37 - that right there
81:39 - you want to add a little background to
81:40 - that so we could see of course bro
81:42 - because now
81:43 - now that we actually have something the
81:44 - min with
81:46 - container let's call this a container
81:48 - right there
81:50 - container let's import style for style
81:53 - components
81:54 - you guys know the drill at this point
81:55 - you know the drill oh from
81:58 - style dash components
82:02 - boom okay go ahead style components
82:05 - that's awesome
82:06 - that's awesome oh okay stock opponents
82:11 - oh my god what if i make my thing style
82:13 - components okay
82:14 - i'm gonna go to const container is equal
82:18 - to
82:19 - styled what that div
82:23 - and that's gonna be background
82:32 - [Music]
82:36 - oh
82:42 - dude oh come on this music is too
82:45 - addicting bro
82:46 - i know man who picked this music i have
82:49 - no idea dude
82:50 - i need to get one of these soundboards
82:51 - from my room so just like i wake up just
82:56 - yeah i agree so look at that orange just
82:58 - right there see
83:00 - right there so i just want to clarify
83:01 - again because na showed us a really cool
83:04 - attribute which is called the min
83:06 - content
83:07 - so this is going to change on how much
83:09 - content you have in there so if you were
83:10 - to make the text bigger or smaller if
83:12 - you were to add
83:13 - more things this height is going to keep
83:15 - adjusting to the minimum amount
83:17 - height needed to cover all the content
83:20 - inside of this
83:21 - exactly yes yeah exactly that is a
83:24 - really good explanation yes daniel
83:25 - that's correct thank you thank you
83:27 - okay inside the chat input what are we
83:29 - going to create a few things guys well
83:31 - the first one we're going to
83:32 - create is going to be the input
83:34 - container which is going to be
83:36 - this input container that uh kind of
83:38 - like uh
83:39 - encapsulates the whole form for the
83:41 - message make sense all right
83:42 - all right let's go ahead and do this so
83:44 - we'll say
83:46 - okay let's create our new style
83:47 - component called input container
83:50 - input container right there okay good
83:53 - all right inside this input container
83:55 - this whole thing is actually gonna be a
83:57 - form so we'll say
83:58 - form form and we're gonna make this in
84:00 - form knots
84:01 - why the reason why we're going to make
84:04 - this a form is because a form
84:05 - allows us gives a functionality to where
84:07 - when we hit
84:08 - the enter button on here on the keyboard
84:10 - guys right it will actually
84:12 - allow us to call a function on the
84:13 - submit of the form right
84:15 - otherwise we have to add some extra
84:16 - functionality if we don't use a form
84:19 - but if we use a form then when we enter
84:21 - when we hit
84:22 - enter enter enter when we enter when we
84:24 - hit enter
84:25 - we can simply call it function and then
84:27 - do whatever you want make sense i love
84:29 - it that makes total sense because you're
84:30 - typing a message
84:31 - and when you click the button you want
84:33 - it to send that message
84:34 - so form simplifies i'll create an input
84:36 - call input type text
84:37 - right there okay and then we'll make a
84:40 - placeholder
84:42 - placeholder is equal to message here
84:46 - message here dot dot dot
84:49 - phone right there god this this music is
84:51 - way too good bro
84:54 - oh message here okay and after that
84:57 - what's going to happen is inside the
84:58 - form let's create a button called the
85:00 - send button
85:00 - right the send button is going to be
85:02 - this button right here
85:04 - this button right here guys okay so do
85:06 - that will they say send button
85:08 - send button bouton right there
85:11 - don't that's gonna send button inside
85:14 - the same button we need to go ahead and
85:15 - get this logo the send logo yeah let's
85:17 - get it from material ui
85:18 - ui let's go so send
85:23 - okay somewhat there send outline do we
85:25 - also send field which one should we use
85:26 - this one or
85:27 - this one i like the filled one i like
85:29 - the fill in two right
85:30 - okay let's use the send send field right
85:32 - there so we'll say send
85:34 - okay let's import that into our code
85:38 - boom sends to icon and we'll do inside
85:40 - here we'll simply say
85:42 - send send it send it
85:47 - oh come on remember that that was a joke
85:49 - for a long time dude yeah
85:51 - send it bro yeah so sendai can now of
85:53 - course we none of this stuff is defined
85:54 - so it's defined right now so here we'll
85:56 - say
85:57 - const what const up input container
86:02 - container implication is equal to
86:06 - style.div
86:08 - oh boom okay good style of div okay
86:11 - all right next up is gonna be uh
86:16 - like a horse so let's go
86:19 - send button
86:23 - send button is equal to what send button
86:25 - is equal to style that do
86:30 - style div right there okay exactly also
86:32 - as well not the most again not the most
86:34 - important thing okay guys here
86:36 - okay so that's gonna be the same button
86:38 - and then at that point that's
86:40 - pretty much it for now let's go ahead
86:43 - and remove this refresh this
86:45 - oh look at this how beautiful is this
86:48 - huh bro
86:49 - and and again just reinforcing what we
86:51 - talked about the main content before
86:52 - if you're just adding things it's going
86:54 - to keep adjusting yes
86:56 - it's going to keep it beautiful
86:57 - beautiful the height this height adjusts
86:59 - right
87:00 - this height will always adjust as well
87:02 - depending
87:03 - on how the height of this that's why
87:05 - this is called auto
87:07 - auto on the show real quick you just
87:08 - kind of just want to like bring it down
87:10 - so if i go to chad yes right there this
87:13 - auto
87:14 - and then so what happens if you start to
87:15 - kind of minimize this window up and down
87:17 - will this just shrink
87:18 - yeah so so if i go to here
87:21 - let me see boom
87:24 - see this right here so that that one has
87:27 - 64 pic the header 64 pixels constant yes
87:30 - content it's always gonna be 64 pixels
87:31 - yes the middle is
87:33 - auto so that one can adjust yes and then
87:36 - the bottom part
87:37 - is min height so it's always going to
87:39 - cover the minimum amount of area that
87:41 - needs to
87:42 - encapsulate everything yes dope makes
87:44 - total makes no sense no again this is
87:46 - important because this makes things
87:48 - mobile friendly right very well friendly
87:49 - this allows you to now have small
87:51 - screens big screens
87:52 - and it's available to be out there so
87:54 - that's why i just wanted to re-emphasize
87:55 - this point
87:56 - always guys we got 352 likes let's get
87:58 - to 400 let's go

88:17 - yes send the link out tell them yo just
88:19 - like
88:19 - this video real quick you only have to
88:22 - watch it just like it
88:23 - and we need to beat the youtube
88:24 - algorithm mm-hmm okay
88:26 - and book a container so that's so good
88:28 - now let's go and send
88:29 - style it sell our input container which
88:32 - is basically the former here
88:33 - okay okay a few things first okay
88:38 - a few things first
88:41 - this container back on orange
88:44 - you see how in our actual app it floats
88:46 - you see how it floats
88:48 - see the bottom here because it has a
88:50 - padding guys
88:52 - because it has a padding so we'll do
88:53 - this we'll do here
88:56 - padding left heading left
88:59 - 20 pixels pending right
89:04 - 20 pixels okay and then finally petting
89:08 - bottom
89:10 - cutting bottom is going to be what
89:16 - patting bottom 24 pixels right there
89:19 - so if i say you see this now just move
89:21 - that right there see so back on orange
89:22 - let me go
89:23 - put this back here boom
89:27 - now you see because it created a padding
89:29 - for all these different components right
89:30 - here
89:31 - that's within the input within the
89:33 - container so the input container now is
89:34 - going to be kind of like
89:36 - padded right here you see you make sense
89:38 - cool
89:39 - awesome up next so that's all good on
89:42 - the input container let's go ahead and
89:43 - do this the input container has a few
89:45 - things well
89:46 - the apple container guys has a border
89:47 - you see this border around it
89:50 - let's make that border so we'll say
89:52 - border here we'll say border
89:54 - okay and we'll give a border of one
89:56 - pixel
89:58 - solid and here's the color guys check
90:00 - out this color it's a cool color
90:02 - hashtag this that's the color we'll use
90:05 - now let's go back to here
90:06 - hey we have ourselves a border now it
90:08 - looks hideous
90:09 - right now right now but but but
90:13 - we need to get some nice curves oh
90:16 - we like curves curves you like curves
90:18 - yes smooth
90:21 - as they like to say smooth so to add
90:24 - curves we'll say border radius
90:28 - radius and here we'll do border radius
90:31 - of four pixels
90:33 - oh smooth look at that so smooth
90:38 - all right cool up next let's now edit
90:41 - the form this form contains the input
90:43 - right if we think about this the input
90:46 - which is this one
90:47 - and the icon which is this one and
90:49 - they're currently kind of on top of each
90:50 - other
90:50 - and how do we make them from left to
90:52 - right now instead of that
90:53 - display flex let's go so we'll say now
90:57 - to target the form as we'll do we'll say
90:59 - form inside the input container
91:02 - and we'll give a display flex
91:05 - 37 by the way display flex perhaps no
91:11 - let's go let's get to guys whatever you
91:14 - do
91:15 - do not share this video no share this
91:17 - video
91:18 - reverse psychology bro oh do not share
91:20 - this video with a friend
91:22 - so do not get the url on top and text it
91:25 - to a friend and tell them to like it do
91:26 - not oh my god bro
91:28 - okay so let's give it a height of 42
91:30 - pixels so that we have 40 pixels that's
91:32 - amazing
91:33 - and look i see now we're here look at
91:35 - this the send button is here
91:37 - the input is here okay great now from
91:39 - left to right that's all beautiful
91:40 - now let's go ahead and do the following
91:42 - let's now align them center so i want to
91:44 - i want this button
91:45 - to be centered vertically make sense how
91:47 - do i do that guys in the comments
91:49 - well we do it by align items
91:53 - and by the way we did get a question i
91:54 - think would be good to address by
91:56 - rd and he says
91:59 - i notice that you spend a lot of time on
92:01 - ui design
92:02 - is this a standard compared to back end
92:05 - code
92:05 - what do you mean by that say one time uh
92:07 - he notices that we're spending a lot of
92:08 - time with the ui design
92:10 - is this standard compared to like
92:12 - spending the time with the back end
92:13 - stuff
92:13 - and the back end code notice you spent a
92:15 - lot of time in your design is this
92:17 - standard compared to back end code
92:18 - um and backing code you don't work on
92:20 - your design much
92:22 - no no i think you're just saying like
92:23 - tam time allocation
92:25 - and to answer that question it's going
92:27 - to be it depends because
92:28 - in this case we don't have a very
92:30 - complicated back end
92:32 - we're just going to be storing the
92:33 - channel names along with
92:35 - some of the text or the the specific
92:37 - things that people are chatting with
92:39 - correct so it's not gonna be too
92:40 - complicated but we're spending a lot of
92:42 - focus
92:42 - on the ui design because again this is
92:44 - gonna be very cool to make very
92:46 - attractive and show because we want to
92:48 - show
92:48 - how you use react js exactly i want to
92:51 - show just how cool programming is in
92:52 - general
92:53 - it's like magic guys it's like you're an
92:55 - inventor like he's an inventor
92:57 - i'm an inventor i got this idea i can
92:59 - put it into use
93:00 - you have an idea you can put it into use
93:02 - and that's like
93:03 - you know i don't have to know anything
93:05 - crazy i don't have to know how to saw
93:06 - things or how to you know wire
93:08 - things no i just need to know how to
93:10 - type on a keyboard
93:12 - that's the really cool part about this
93:13 - all right yeah and to add to that
93:16 - there might be a very complicated
93:18 - project that does need a lot of
93:20 - attention in the back end
93:21 - so sometimes maybe they bring on the
93:23 - team of people where someone works on
93:25 - the back end some work on the front end
93:26 - it's very integrated it's just gonna
93:28 - depend on the project to answer your
93:29 - question
93:30 - always always so now let's do this guys
93:31 - okay now for this portion okay a few
93:34 - things let's give it a padding left
93:38 - because here's the thing how do we go
93:39 - ahead and push this input more from the
93:42 - left hand side
93:44 - yes so we'll padding left panning left
93:48 - we'll do 10 pixels done
93:51 - okay good all right now let's go ahead
93:54 - and make this input actually a width of
93:55 - 100 how do we do that
93:56 - guys how do we push the send button all
93:58 - the way to the end right here
94:00 - and make this input the whole thing
94:03 - how do you do that what do you think
94:06 - what do you think how do that what do
94:07 - you think
94:08 - i don't know you tell me what do you
94:09 - think you tell me what do you
94:11 - say i know you tell me bro what do you
94:12 - think i know
94:14 - here's what i know well we we're going
94:17 - to target now the input let's talk at
94:19 - the input
94:20 - and the cool thing about flex guys is
94:22 - that you can tell flags the importance
94:23 - of something
94:25 - so for example for the input i can say
94:26 - flex one
94:28 - right here look at this boom you see
94:30 - that right there
94:31 - now the input here guys the input right
94:34 - here let me go ahead and show it to you
94:35 - guys
94:36 - so you guys can see it maybe this little
94:37 - bit better now this input right here
94:41 - boom right there see it has a flux of
94:43 - one meaning
94:44 - this input is the most important part
94:48 - in this section meaning it's going to
94:50 - take up as much width as it possibly can
94:53 - that's how you say flex one okay if i
94:56 - set flag
94:56 - 0.5 okay
95:00 - for example see it's gonna take up zero
95:02 - point five
95:03 - if i say flex one it's gonna take up as
95:06 - much as it can
95:06 - what do you do 0.75
95:12 - 0.75
95:17 - cool right that's pretty cool flex one
95:19 - right there awesome
95:20 - so we got that portion that's all good
95:22 - let's now go ahead and do the following
95:24 - let's remove this hideous border from
95:25 - this input so we'll say border
95:28 - border is none boom
95:31 - done save that boom now see the border
95:33 - is gone beautiful it's gone
95:34 - yeah next up let's go ahead and do a

97:45 - but look at this we can the first things
97:47 - first is let's go ahead and make it a
97:48 - nice lean round okay
97:49 - so we'll say border radius make it
97:52 - smooth
97:53 - we'll say border radius two pixels so
97:54 - border radius
97:56 - radius ds is equal to two pixels
98:02 - and look at this i'm gonna zoom in on

98:27 - we're just modifying it with css and
98:28 - then it just shows it up on the view
98:29 - which is a really cool part
98:31 - 32 pixels and again with css a lot of
98:33 - has to do with just
98:34 - practice practice practice and just
98:36 - testing things out and see how they will
98:38 - work out that's pretty much it width
98:40 - height of 30 pixels

107:18 - tomorrow's
107:19 - activity exactly so i'll do that right
107:21 - now okay
107:22 - first things first in our app okay what
107:25 - do we need to do
107:27 - which one is our do we just build this
107:29 - one this one i think is this one right
107:30 - yes this one yeah yeah this one cool
107:34 - all right um inside now let's go back to
107:36 - chat yes and
107:37 - we have this message container which is
107:38 - all great no problem okay
107:40 - inside of my secretary let's create an
107:41 - individual message so we'll have an
107:43 - individual message let's go ahead and do

107:44 - and we'll say message okay right there
107:47 - message and you can see it appears here
107:49 - correct yes
107:50 - first here well let's actually create a
107:52 - message component because every single
107:53 - message
107:54 - that you see here for example i always
107:56 - have to expand this one
107:58 - you see everything message is its own
107:59 - message component
108:01 - this is where components are going to be
108:02 - so useful because we're going to reuse
108:04 - that portion okay so similar to what we
108:05 - did with the channels before
108:07 - we just have a component for a message
108:09 - and then we can just put in whatever
108:11 - data we want and use it all over there
108:12 - exactly
108:13 - so let's go inside the components let's
108:15 - create a chat message so components
108:16 - new file by the way guys let's get to
108:19 - 500 likes and we'll dance again
108:20 - so chat message
108:23 - dot js yes
108:26 - let's do rfce right there
108:30 - right there save that chat message okay
108:32 - save that oh good
108:34 - we have the component for the chat
108:35 - message let's go check the gs and let's
108:37 - import the component in here so we'll
108:38 - say here
108:39 - import chat message from where
108:44 - from what from where oh we just created
108:47 - the chat
108:47 - message message exactly okay now let's
108:50 - use that chat message so we'll use that
108:52 - right here
108:52 - chat message chat message
108:56 - boom right there you see chat message
108:59 - the chat message
109:00 - now is going to be this component let's
109:01 - go and say type this out chat
109:03 - message component save that and boom
109:06 - like this you see
109:07 - chat message component is now in here
109:08 - guys hopefully you understand that okay
109:10 - cool all right let's now work on the
109:13 - chat message if java is going to have a
109:14 - few things the first is
109:15 - the first thing is always going to be
109:16 - the container container
109:19 - okay container okay cool container is
109:22 - all good okay
109:23 - now not defined no problem let's go
109:25 - ahead import style components you know
109:27 - the drill so import styled
109:30 - from what from what bro from style
109:32 - components
109:33 - dash components
109:36 - okay from style components okay that's
109:38 - okay that's all good and let's
109:40 - now do const what container
109:44 - is equal to what styled what that div
109:47 - and that's it style.diff makes sense
109:50 - okay
109:51 - okay cool so let's give it a background
109:52 - color for now let's get the background
109:54 - color of for example

110:45 - again don't worry about that user avatar
110:47 - and don't worry about just yet
110:48 - after that we'll have the actual message
110:50 - content so we have message content
110:54 - content right there and this message

110:58 - the first thing is going to have is just
110:59 - a name
111:01 - name right which is going to be what
111:05 - you think about this what do we have
111:07 - this name

113:21 - message content is equal to also
113:25 - dot div
113:29 - style okay then after that we need to go
113:32 - ahead and create the name
113:33 - now inside here i can actually do a span
113:37 - right you can actually do a span like
113:39 - this check this out guys let's do
113:40 - you know how we did message that like

114:14 - okay so now we have the container uh
114:17 - don't worry about that though
114:18 - no guys don't worry about that all right
114:20 - let's make this a little bit smaller so
114:22 - we can
114:22 - watch what we're doing i'm gonna make
114:24 - just a little bit less
114:26 - okay cool all right this is the best
114:28 - challenge right here name and so forth
114:30 - all right
114:30 - for this to work now let's go ahead and
114:33 - add an image what's an is you ready for
114:35 - this add an image we can actually
114:36 - generate in a get
114:38 - a random a random look at this a
114:41 - random random
114:44 - user look at this guys random views
114:47 - generator
114:48 - this will generate aw user for example
114:50 - this is new
114:51 - new new new doesn't matter right so
114:53 - general and abuser
114:55 - this is funny holy moly hey cafe rossi
114:58 - cafe rossi hector byron
115:02 - amanda i'm going to use this amanda
115:04 - she's amanda here
115:05 - helping me address hopefully i hope this
115:07 - hobby is not a real name
115:10 - i don't know i really don't know but she
115:11 - looks like amanda i don't know why
115:13 - [Laughter]
115:15 - sorry man i mean it's out there you know
115:17 - so what can we say
115:18 - image source okay command v
115:21 - and that's going to be the person right
115:22 - here see that's image source to jpeg so
115:24 - if we save this
115:26 - okay amanda's right there okay cool
115:28 - that's amanda right there amanda
115:29 - is now very popular at this point that's
115:33 - funny
115:33 - now with this specific portion a few
115:35 - things are going to happen
115:37 - we need to make the user avatar kind of
115:39 - a certain width and height does that
115:41 - make sense
115:42 - so user avatar let's do this we'll say
115:45 - here
115:46 - here it's going to be width
115:49 - width is going to be what weight is
115:51 - going to be 36 pixels
115:54 - and height is also going to be
115:57 - 36 pixels boom
116:01 - now i know amanda is not fit the box
116:04 - unfortunately but why well there's a few
116:06 - reasons why
116:07 - is because the image actually is still
116:10 - overflowing right if i inspect element
116:12 - you can see here that
116:13 - amanda yeah this is the div you see but
116:16 - the amanda's overflowing so here's what
116:17 - we do
116:18 - inside the user avatar i say image now
116:20 - and i say look at this
116:21 - width of a hundred percent save that
116:25 - boom right there you see right there
116:28 - beautiful beautiful
116:29 - okay let's add a small border is we'll
116:30 - do border radius here border radius
116:34 - radius radius
116:38 - ah radius off let's say two pixels
116:41 - save that and now now amanda here does
116:44 - not have you see if i
116:45 - if i zoom in there's really no like
116:47 - curvature curve
116:49 - right now smooth no smooth
116:52 - so here's what we'll do to prevent that
116:53 - we'll do overflow
116:57 - hidden one right there over
117:00 - nice by the right or flow hidden save
117:02 - that and look at that now amanda you see
117:05 - that has a curve you see that right
117:06 - there
117:07 - there's a curve right there that's good
117:08 - right here clean yeah
117:10 - reason why is because unless it's
117:11 - overflow hidden then basically
117:13 - then the the edges guys the edges are
117:15 - kind of outside the container
117:18 - and so you need to say no if they're
117:19 - outside if they're overflowing then hide
117:21 - them and that's what makes the curvature
117:22 - okay
117:23 - cool all right we got that portion now
117:26 - let's go ahead and move all this stuff
117:27 - together
117:28 - into its own little thing so for the
117:29 - container number one i want to do is i
117:31 - want to remove this background it looks
117:33 - hideous okay the first thing i want to
117:34 - do is i want to add
117:35 - some padding so oh we just got another
117:38 - five
117:39 - dollar donation by oh c i t
117:42 - solutions he said you guys rock keep

118:02 - what does it say thanks thanks asks
118:08 - oh my god that's funny cool so let's do
118:10 - this we'll do padding
118:12 - okay we'll do 8 pixels 8 pixels
118:17 - comma 20 pixels now what does this mean
118:19 - 8 20 pixels
118:21 - this means that eight pixels is actually
118:24 - vertical
118:25 - padding 20 places is horizontal padding
118:27 - so basically mean left
118:28 - and right this is a shortcut you got a
118:30 - shortcut you want to
118:31 - you want to learn right this is a
118:33 - vertical top and bottom this is left and
118:35 - right
118:35 - second number so we'll do 20 pixels here
118:37 - 20 pixels here
118:38 - eight pixels here episodes here
118:40 - understandable beautiful beautiful okay

122:46 - on
122:48 - this the text portion the text portion
122:50 - is pretty much this is the best
122:51 - challenge
122:51 - lasa adds a little margin to the span so
122:53 - we'll do span
122:55 - i will do here we'll do margin right
122:58 - let's also do eight pixels

123:20 - margin dash left let's do eight pixels
123:23 - here
123:25 - okay margie left eight pixels on this
123:27 - one that creates that beautiful

132:36 - you there's no no problem whatsoever
132:38 - it's not paid um for the first year
132:41 - it's completely free so just yeah
132:43 - perfect someone aaron asked
132:46 - can you show us how to do dark modes at
132:48 - the very bottom can you show us how to
132:50 - do dark mode
132:51 - now aaron we're gonna try to get to some
132:54 - extra functionality
132:55 - towards the end of tomorrow depending on
132:57 - how fast we wrap up the entire project
133:00 - we might do that or we might do a search
133:01 - function and kind of dive into that but
133:03 - if not
133:04 - this is something nice i don't see it um
133:08 - i think uh he was at the bottom of put
133:10 - more
133:11 - okay i don't see it anyways his name is
133:12 - aaron um but
133:14 - if not these are things that you can
133:16 - have in mind of things that you
133:18 - want to implement right and you know if
133:21 - you just talk to people inside the
133:22 - community
133:23 - you might also find other people that
133:24 - might be interested in implementing that
133:25 - as well like you go to the slack
133:27 - community
133:27 - or sorry the discord community you could
133:29 - go to facebook like guys i want to
133:30 - implement dark modes anyone else that's
133:32 - interested
133:32 - and people like yeah i'm interested and
133:34 - together you guys could figure it out
133:36 - yes guys so dark mode guys guys again
133:39 - dark mode is pretty simple to implement
133:40 - okay guys
133:41 - you can for example just how we set the
133:43 - background color of these specific
133:44 - sections okay
133:45 - you can change the background color for
133:46 - example this section let's say maybe
133:48 - this section you set the background
133:49 - color for example to maybe like gray who
133:51 - knows
133:51 - let me just think about this for example
133:52 - here let's say the background color of
133:54 - this is going to be like
133:55 - see right there now i'm making making it
133:57 - dark you see it right there bro
133:58 - see right there 277 i might do the same
134:01 - thing for example on
134:02 - on this one okay cool cool maybe let's
134:06 - do the same thing on
134:06 - here boom dark mode you see down here
134:10 - so we'll do maybe change it to there
134:12 - beautiful you see now it's starting to
134:13 - make into dark mode right there see
134:15 - maybe for example the chat now the chat
134:17 - message maybe i make that into for
134:19 - example
134:21 - maybe maybe that's like color for
134:23 - example color background color of this
134:25 - specific
134:26 - hole this whole thing for example maybe
134:28 - the background background of this
134:30 - for example is gray no not gray i don't
134:32 - want dark gray
134:34 - no no no no no no no no no dim grape
134:38 - let's just say gray for example but i
134:40 - will change it up in a second here
134:42 - so just say it's like
134:45 - let me just think about this maybe it's
134:47 - like this who knows right
134:48 - and then what you can do is you can
134:50 - change the color of the actual text so
134:51 - like color to be white
134:53 - see right there see now it's like dark
134:55 - mode you see it right there so it's so
134:57 - much easier now right dark mode
134:59 - and now you made this too white made
135:01 - this to white and so right there
135:02 - i just changed up to dark mode for you
135:04 - guys right now of course you still might
135:05 - need to change this message in here
135:07 - so for example this message you might
135:09 - change this one to be like for example
135:11 - maybe background color
135:14 - transparent boom done see
135:17 - done just like that it's so simple so
135:20 - simple guys
135:21 - just think about how would you go and
135:23 - this is pretty cool it's a pretty cool
135:24 - dark mode looks
135:25 - good yeah it looks pretty good i would
135:26 - say so awesome all right any other
135:28 - questions you guys have
135:33 - any questions where's my quest where's
135:35 - my chat where the jedi i don't know
135:36 - bro were you showing the screen right
135:38 - now
135:40 - no i was i wasn't working i just changed
135:41 - yeah yeah so
135:43 - yeah i think coding was spent hey swears
135:45 - in the house
135:46 - man says google for dogma you will find
135:48 - tutorials that is how i got it nice
135:50 - that's awesome nice job swen
135:52 - okay but when you inspect glass name my
135:55 - gibberish names
135:56 - okay these their names their gibberish
135:58 - names because
136:00 - of react right they are not jewish names
136:03 - when you go ahead
136:04 - you would change it up in the actual
136:05 - classes when you go back to the
136:07 - component
136:08 - the gibberish names temporarily because
136:09 - that's how react works
136:11 - okay okay we can do
136:16 - what we're getting the monist dude
136:19 - daniel's neck automatically moves to the
136:21 - beach
136:21 - i know it's always like dude it's gonna
136:25 - have the music right here in my
136:25 - headphones so
136:27 - i'm always
136:32 - sunday said you can make a component
136:34 - instead um
136:35 - of a style div and go about it like so
136:37 - and have the style components under yeah
136:39 - that's that's that's true as well that's
136:40 - really good as well must be correct yes
136:43 - okay uh because they are dynamically
136:46 - created by stackable yes correct marios
136:47 - yes that is right
136:49 - there they now create a buy style
136:50 - components
136:52 - maybe create a function that allows the
136:54 - user to switch that would be cool if you
136:55 - guys can do that that'd be awesome
136:57 - right so that means basically the css
136:59 - will change depending on you know the
137:02 - the component and so forth depending on
137:03 - if you have it like on or off
137:05 - so i kind of like that i like it that
137:07 - will probably you have to use something
137:08 - like use state for example for dark mode
137:10 - versus light mode right
137:11 - so like dark mode falls and so a lot of
137:13 - your css will depend on the
137:15 - like if the dark mode variable is true
137:17 - or false
137:18 - bro dude it's cause the monitor keeps
137:22 -  smash oh gosh oh we just hit 450
137:25 - live oh
137:27 - let's go

138:19 - not a part-time dj i use a part-time dj
138:21 - yes
138:22 - yes yes uh mongodb
138:25 - is very similar to firebase correct but
138:27 - firebase consists of
138:28 - other things mongodb is a little more
138:30 - functional around in terms of how you
138:31 - can query it
138:32 - but it's pretty similar firebase on the
138:34 - other hand allows us to have real-time
138:36 - communication which is a really cool
138:37 - part of the box
138:39 - so there's a lot more to that amazing
