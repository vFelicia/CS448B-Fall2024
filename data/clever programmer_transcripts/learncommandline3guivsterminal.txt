00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:03 - episode of the command line tutorial
00:06 - Series
00:08 - so now we are going to be doing more
00:11 - practical things okay I want you to keep
00:13 - playing that game on your own it's a
00:16 - great game to play but let's uh jump in
00:19 - and start doing some more practical
00:20 - things so on the left hand side we see
00:24 - the actual world as you see it so if
00:26 - you're using Windows you'll see a
00:27 - different world but essentially it's the
00:29 - same idea you got some folders you got
00:31 - directories you got files and all that
00:34 - stuff and if you're looking at Linux or
00:37 - Mac or whatever it's going to look
00:39 - pretty
00:40 - similar to what I have on my left hand
00:43 - side so now let's see how moving in the
00:46 - real world looks in the terminal World
00:49 - okay and once you understand that it's
00:51 - essentially the same thing you will
00:53 - become a lot less intimidated with it
00:55 - and start to understand what's going on
00:59 - all right so
01:00 - so okay so I clicked on documents and
01:03 - I'm in this folder called documents I
01:06 - don't know what its depth is I don't
01:08 - know um if it's in users or if it's in
01:13 - like my directory like users slash
01:16 - something slash documents or whatever so
01:18 - I can figure that
01:20 - out uh first of all on the right hand
01:22 - side I'm going to do LS and just see
01:24 - what's around me and when I look around
01:26 - me I see this thing called documents
01:30 - and so if I go to
01:33 - documents how can I check where I am so
01:36 - if you remember from your previous
01:37 - commands if you're ever lost there's
01:39 - something called print working directory
01:41 - so whatever directory you're currently
01:43 - in that's your working directory so if I
01:47 - hit
01:48 - PWD it tells me I'm in user chest tastic
01:52 - documents which is actually this thing
01:55 - okay so I'm actually here but from my
01:57 - terminal rather than my gooey graphical
02:01 - user
02:03 - interface so I know I said user with the
02:06 - S but it's
02:07 - user now if I hit LS what do you expect
02:10 - to see do you expect to see playground
02:12 - do you expect to see uh playground here
02:15 - Final Cut Pro do you see do you expect
02:17 - to see those things well let me hit
02:19 - LS and indeed you see Final Cut Pro
02:23 - playground clever programmer and
02:24 - everything that's on the leftand side
02:26 - here you see that on the right hand side
02:28 - right there
02:31 - now what if I wanted to do something
02:36 - more let's say I want to actually go
02:37 - inside of a directory while I can do CD
02:40 - playground you remember that one so if I
02:43 - do CD playground that's effectively
02:44 - going to playground and double clicking
02:47 - playground okay
02:50 - so I want to keep this video
02:55 - short because I really want to be
02:58 - explicit and make sure you understand
03:00 - understand what it is that we're doing
03:02 - here uh even if the last two videos were
03:05 - maybe a little confusing or if they
03:06 - didn't do a good job of explaining this
03:08 - concept it's okay if this still seems a
03:10 - little bit basic because fundamentals
03:13 - are the most important part of this we
03:15 - will get to the more advanced things but
03:17 - I don't want to take any for anything
03:18 - for granted I want to make sure you
03:20 - understand every step of the way and in
03:22 - the next video I'll show you how you can
03:25 - perhaps create a folder right from your
03:29 - command line all right I'll see you in
03:32 - the next video
