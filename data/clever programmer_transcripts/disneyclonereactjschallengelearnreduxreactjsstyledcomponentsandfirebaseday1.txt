00:12 - as you can see look at this let me put
00:14 - this making this full screen
00:16 - this is a beautiful ad that we we're
00:18 - going to build we're going to use
00:20 - firebase we're going to use redux
00:22 - we're going to use react on our dom
00:24 - we're going to use
00:25 - let me see what else are we going to use
00:26 - we're going to use things like you know
00:29 - a react slick to be able to create this
00:31 - slick animation right here right
00:33 - uh so many different things we're going
00:35 - to use style components all is going to
00:37 - be used here
00:38 - okay and of course we're using vs code
00:41 - for to be able to build this
00:42 - look at all these animations if i go
00:44 - ahead and click on this i can sign out
00:47 - beautiful and then i can click login to
00:49 - login again with my this is by the way
00:51 - using firebase authentication
00:53 - so i can log in like this oh
00:56 - we're set we're set hello youtube hello
00:59 - everybody i hope you guys are doing
01:00 - great
01:01 - all right so let's go actually get this
01:03 - party started
01:04 - let's get straight into it um so a few
01:06 - things we need to do
01:07 - to go ahead and get this started like i
01:09 - said this is going to be
01:11 - a very detailed build we might split
01:13 - this up into two parts but this is how
01:15 - we're going to do it all right beautiful
01:17 - all right okay so now at this point what
01:20 - we need to do
01:21 - is the first things first is let's go
01:22 - ahead and build out our actual project
01:25 - by starting up a you know project using
01:27 - react
01:28 - so what you need to do of course for
01:29 - this you need a node.js so the first
01:31 - thing you need to do is you need to
01:32 - install node.js hopefully you have that
01:34 - by now
01:35 - so node.js right here very very
01:38 - important right that's gonna be what you
01:39 - need
01:40 - that's not gs all right so make sure you
01:41 - install the recommended version
01:43 - okay once you've got that of course you
01:45 - need to install pretty much just
01:47 - use code and once you're done with that
01:48 - you're pretty much all set okay
01:50 - all right sweet sweet sweet so let's go
01:53 - ahead and open up our finder or
01:55 - uh something where we go ahead and
01:57 - actually open up a folder
01:58 - i'm gonna go ahead new finder here new
02:00 - finder uh
02:02 - new finder window hopefully i can find
02:05 - it here
02:05 - where's my new finder window right there
02:08 - all right and then we'll go i have a
02:09 - github folder here
02:10 - right here and this is called nas and
02:12 - i'm going to do new services new
02:14 - terminal at folder so i'm going to open
02:16 - up a new terminal folder
02:17 - if you're in windows you might have to
02:19 - do it differently you might have to use
02:20 - your terminal
02:21 - kind of like on windows um so what i
02:24 - will do at this point is i will say type
02:26 - in npx
02:27 - create create i'm gonna go and make this
02:30 - a little bit bigger so you can you can
02:31 - all see it
02:32 - npx npx create
02:37 - create dash dash react
02:41 - react dash app dash
02:44 - template redux right so we're going to
02:47 - use redux for this specific application
02:49 - so npx create react app dash dash
02:53 - template
02:54 - redux is what you need to do so click
02:56 - enter on this one
02:58 - and there is a way with run to seo
03:00 - options
03:01 - please specify the project okay so the
03:03 - issue is i just specify the project name
03:05 - here
03:05 - so nps query react app and we're going
03:08 - to call it disney
03:09 - disney plus dash
03:12 - clone right here so npx queer react app
03:16 - disney plus clone dash template redux
03:18 - hit enter all right that's all going
03:21 - doing so what's happening here is very
03:22 - simple guys okay
03:23 - what's going on is basically it's
03:25 - building all the scripts it's building
03:27 - it's initializing a the first project
03:29 - for us
03:30 - uh in order to be able to do something
03:32 - like this and of course hello youtube
03:34 - hello
03:34 - everybody i see all of you guys well we
03:36 - have a 20
03:37 - donation from on let's go beautiful

04:06 - basically a sunday key job and then make
04:08 - more money from other jobs as well so
04:10 - pretty pretty insane
04:12 - all right now at this point that's
04:14 - that's it so what we've done here is
04:16 - we've created our project
04:17 - it says happy hacking once it says happy
04:19 - hacking you're pretty much
04:21 - done okay i'm going to put up some music
04:23 - here so we cannot be listening to a
04:24 - little music while we're coding
04:27 - all right so happy hacking beautiful all
04:29 - right at this point
04:30 - what we need to do is you see how it
04:32 - created this folder called disney plus
04:34 - clone
04:34 - right here and all we need to do is very
04:37 - simple
04:38 - we need to go ahead and open this up and
04:40 - we use code all right so let me put this
04:42 - this code on here on the right hand side
04:44 - and of course hopefully you can do this
04:46 - by your with by yourself as well
04:50 - all right i'm gonna open up a new new
04:53 - window with vs code there we go
04:56 - beautiful that's a new window i just
04:58 - opened up i will do file
05:00 - open open and then go to my
05:03 - github go to nas here and then the one
05:05 - that we just did
05:06 - is what the disney plus clone that's the
05:08 - one we just opened up so let's go ahead
05:09 - and do that right
05:10 - now beautiful all right sweet all right
05:12 - and here's what we got now so
05:14 - right this is the project that we
05:16 - started with with or basically react
05:18 - gs you can see we have source and
05:20 - there's a few files that you need to pay
05:21 - attention to the
05:22 - the one file that you need to really
05:24 - really pay attention to
05:25 - is kind of like uh well this one right
05:28 - here is we have app.js that's kind of
05:30 - like your main file
05:31 - right here and what we can do is if we
05:33 - do go ahead and do
05:34 - let's do right click on the yarn.lock
05:36 - and then say open
05:38 - inside integrate terminal right here
05:41 - and then do npm npm start
05:44 - boom npm star so click npm start
05:47 - beautiful
05:48 - that will start up your project guys
05:50 - okay
05:51 - that will set up your project and now at
05:53 - this point you should see it
05:54 - right here oh let's go
05:58 - this is our first react js
06:01 - project reactor js project
06:04 - okay of course you can click can hit
06:06 - plus right here to
06:07 - add edit you can hit minus and the way
06:11 - it's working
06:11 - it's working with redux is because we're
06:13 - able to for example click plus and minus
06:15 - with redux
06:16 - right and redux is a way for us to save
06:19 - state and we'll talk about how
06:20 - that's done later on a little bit okay
06:22 - so subtract number three two one
06:24 - zero and so forth that's pretty awesome
06:27 - all right so this is our first project
06:28 - right here and what we need to do is
06:30 - very simple this point
06:31 - is let's do some cleanup okay that's
06:33 - part one
06:34 - all right in terms of cleanup let me go
06:36 - ahead and make this right here uh app.js
06:38 - don't really need
06:39 - anything here now just remove that
06:42 - sayonata baby let's go that's done all
06:45 - right save that
06:46 - that's what i'm talking about all right
06:49 - okay that's what i'm talking about so we
06:51 - don't need that
06:52 - all right so now it's clean right and i
06:54 - can type whatever whatever i want in
06:55 - here so i'll say hello
06:57 - boom right if i say hello okay so really
07:00 - just anything i kind of want
07:02 - all right if i for example look at these
07:04 - other things uh
07:05 - we have 300 views 300 people on youtube
07:08 - hold up what's up what's up what's up
07:09 - amazing to have all of you guys here as
07:11 - always as always
07:13 - okay beautiful hello hello hello great
07:16 - travel
07:16 - creation always helps me some of you
07:17 - somebody said all right
07:19 - so that's if i say hello here you can
07:21 - see we have hello on here next up let's
07:23 - go ahead and clean up some
07:24 - css here uh at that css
07:27 - just command a don't need none of this
07:30 - right
07:30 - save it don't need none of this it's all
07:33 - i'm not i'm not going to say useless but
07:34 - it's unnecessary for us
07:36 - okay so that's done uh test.js don't
07:39 - need any of this
07:40 - do remove delete this one right here too
07:43 - with the trash
07:44 - okay do not need that okay uh next thing
07:47 - logo you see this logo import logo from
07:49 - logo svg
07:50 - don't need this either boom right here
07:53 - okay
07:54 - do not need that okay and
07:57 - that's pretty much it next up let me see
07:59 - next time let me see
08:04 - i will go ahead and do the following is
08:06 - let me go ahead and do this
08:08 - so we have that next up let's go you see
08:10 - how we have this counter we don't need
08:11 - this counter
08:12 - as well so that's not too much important
08:14 - little svg remove this one
08:16 - unnecessary all right and now we have a
08:19 - pretty clean
08:20 - clean app now what i want to do is let's
08:22 - go ahead and create components all right
08:24 - i'm going to create a new folder here
08:25 - i'm going to create a components folder
08:28 - right so the reason why we like to do
08:30 - that is because just
08:31 - it makes things so much simpler right so
08:32 - it just creates a components folder
08:34 - and that's over all of your components
08:36 - will live
08:38 - now let's really think about how are we
08:40 - going to
08:41 - build this application right this
08:44 - application contains a lot of different
08:45 - aspects
08:46 - all right let's think about what it
08:49 - needs for us to actually build this
08:51 - um a few things as you can see here that
08:53 - part one
08:54 - is we kind of have the header right here
08:56 - that's part one
08:57 - and i always like to think about the
08:59 - structure of you know anything that i'm
09:01 - building
09:01 - so for example um if i do this
09:05 - so this right here is my header okay
09:08 - so i know that i need to build a header
09:09 - that's part one part two i need to go
09:12 - ahead and build a slider
09:13 - that's gonna be another component i need
09:15 - to go ahead and create okay
09:16 - that's part two part three is i'm going
09:19 - to basically
09:20 - then build up this right here this
09:22 - viewer it's called a viewer
09:24 - right that's going to be what we will do
09:26 - with that so
09:27 - that's another component after that what
09:30 - we'll go ahead and do
09:31 - is we'll build this movies list that's
09:34 - going to be a third
09:36 - component and so what now has happened
09:39 - is we've just divided our
09:42 - application into multiple components
09:45 - right and this is how every single app
09:49 - works or basically on you know
09:52 - that's how every single app kind of
09:54 - works you know when
09:55 - we're going to build it in react.js
09:57 - honestly
09:58 - any app you're going to build online
10:02 - so let's see it so these are the
10:05 - components we want to build
10:06 - let's actually go ahead and build them
10:08 - right here now
10:09 - we know there's multiple pages for here
10:11 - inside the add.js
10:13 - we'll create a component called header
10:15 - right here
10:18 - and this looks like a div but really
10:20 - it's kind of like it's a component
10:22 - so pretty much it is a div but it's a
10:25 - div that contains another component
10:27 - and what i will do is i will create a
10:29 - file inside the components folder and
10:31 - i'll say header.js
10:33 - that gs boom right there then what i'm
10:36 - going to do is i'm going to use
10:37 - the es7 code snippets which hopefully
10:39 - you have when you installed
10:41 - extensions which is this one right here
10:43 - you see esm react code snippets right
10:46 - there
10:46 - right see some redco snippets right here
10:48 - hopefully you installed that at this
10:50 - point
10:51 - and once you've done that if i click on
10:54 - header.js which is the one
10:55 - the file i created i will do rfce
10:59 - boom done danzo down to dunzo
11:02 - right and you can see this is our app.js
11:04 - so we have the header component inside
11:05 - here
11:07 - now that we've done that let's type in
11:08 - header in here so save that
11:11 - go to app.js and what's going to happen
11:13 - now at this point
11:14 - is um well we need to import the header
11:18 - so i'm going to say import
11:20 - header from from what
11:23 - well from components folder from the
11:26 - components folder so i will do like this
11:28 - components dash header done
11:32 - components header okay i will go and
11:34 - save this now at this point
11:36 - right and once i've done that if if i
11:38 - look at my
11:39 - app look at that it says header right
11:42 - there
11:43 - header right that is the header right so
11:46 - we've just
11:46 - created the header component using this
11:49 - okay
11:50 - all right beautiful now let's go to
11:52 - head.js
11:53 - and inside here we're going to use style
11:55 - component now what style components are
11:57 - basically css
11:58 - within javascript all right
12:01 - let's try this out um to use style
12:04 - components
12:05 - what i'm going to do is actually install
12:07 - them first let's go ahead and do plus
12:09 - on our integrated terminal right here
12:12 - now we'll do
12:12 - the following npm install
12:15 - styled dash components
12:19 - stardust components done beautiful
12:24 - awesome style dash components okay so
12:28 - this installed
12:29 - it just installed the components okay
12:32 - that's awesome
12:33 - there we go beautiful that's amazing
12:36 - and then what are we going to do now at
12:38 - this point is we need to import it now
12:40 - right
12:41 - so i'm going to import styled
12:44 - from styled
12:48 - styled dash com
12:54 - dash components beautiful
12:57 - awesome import style from the stylish
12:59 - components save
13:00 - that save that and look here's what we
13:03 - can do now check this out remember how
13:04 - we had this div
13:05 - right remember this dip well i can
13:07 - replace this deal with it it's actually
13:09 - a
13:09 - basically like uh like a style component
13:12 - so take this out
13:13 - container i'll rename this to container
13:18 - like so right to a little the container
13:20 - right here
13:22 - right and you see it says container is
13:25 - not defined
13:26 - no problem whatsoever we'll fix this in
13:27 - a second here so i'm going to say now at
13:29 - this point
13:30 - the following const container
13:35 - container is equal to styled dot div
13:38 - so really we're creating a div with
13:40 - javascript
13:41 - you see instead of saying div here we're
13:44 - saying container so we name it whatever
13:46 - we want
13:46 - but then we create a style.dip now check
13:48 - this out what can we do with that well a
13:50 - few things
13:51 - we can give it a height so let's give it
13:52 - a height for example let's give it a
13:54 - height
13:56 - height of let's say for example 70
13:57 - pixels
13:59 - 70 pixels okay save that
14:02 - all right and then let's get the
14:04 - background color so i'm gonna say
14:05 - background
14:08 - background color and i'm gonna give it
14:10 - this color right here and you i want you
14:11 - guys to copy this as well by yourself
14:13 - okay
14:14 - so this is zero nine zero b one three
14:17 - that's hashtag right there
14:18 - all right save that beautiful and so
14:21 - forth and look at this right here
14:22 - boom look the header is created is
14:25 - pretty much created you see
14:29 - the header is now created right here
14:32 - which directly maps to just this
14:34 - container that's all
14:36 - all we literally had to do that's all we
14:39 - had to do
14:40 - right that's all we had to do okay
14:43 - beautiful
14:44 - all right next up once we've done that
14:46 - that's in the background color
14:48 - right all right so let's go ahead and
14:51 - save this background color
14:52 - so that's in the header okay beautiful
14:55 - next up
14:55 - is the phone let's gonna now create
14:57 - another component called home
15:00 - now what is the home well the home will
15:02 - be this portion
15:04 - which is this whole thing right
15:07 - well called home component right right
15:10 - why we're going to call home component
15:12 - what do you think we're go why do you
15:13 - think we're going to call the home
15:14 - component like
15:15 - let me know in the comments below right
15:16 - it's because
15:18 - we have multiple pages we have a home
15:20 - page we have
15:22 - a you know a login page and we have a
15:25 - detail page when i click on a detail i
15:27 - we have a detail page as well
15:29 - and so that's what we're going to call
15:30 - home it's like opponents new file
15:33 - let's create home home.gs
15:36 - boom right there beautiful beautiful
15:39 - beautiful beautiful so that's
15:40 - that's our home.gs let's do rfce again
15:44 - and again if you don't have rfc you just
15:46 - kind of copy this portion right here to
15:48 - your terminal
15:49 - and uh put into your vs code okay
15:52 - i'm just going to call this home boom
15:54 - right there awesome
15:56 - okay add that gs let's import home of
15:59 - course we need to import it
16:01 - the cool thing about react.js is you can
16:02 - import and export things right just kind
16:04 - of how you
16:05 - you import and export with you know with
16:07 - trucks and you know in real life
16:09 - it's the same thing we can export just
16:11 - how you see if you go to home.gs
16:13 - you see you export a function or a
16:15 - component
16:16 - right you export it right here and then
16:18 - inside app.js
16:19 - we import it so i'm going to say here
16:22 - home
16:24 - from components
16:29 - what which one do you think would do
16:31 - home right that's the one we're going to
16:33 - create
16:33 - beautiful all right next thing we're
16:36 - going to do is put the home
16:38 - inside here boom right there
16:42 - all right all right beautiful so let's
16:44 - go ahead and save this one
16:46 - all right i like it i like it i like it
16:48 - and if you go to home.gs we'll call it
16:50 - home
16:50 - so really if we go to our react boom we
16:53 - have home right here right
16:54 - now bars here home is here awesome all
16:57 - right so part one let's focus
16:59 - on just the header for now right our
17:02 - goal is to get to a header that looks
17:04 - pretty much just kind of like this
17:07 - pretty much just kind of like this right
17:08 - here okay
17:09 - it's pretty much just kind of like this
17:11 - all right so what are we going to do
17:12 - inside here well a few things right
17:14 - let's go and dive this up into a few
17:15 - different things well we have here this
17:17 - is the
17:18 - thing about this the divs is we have
17:19 - this is a div
17:21 - this is an image and then we have like a
17:23 - nav menu portion right here
17:25 - right and we call this a nav menu and
17:27 - then this is going to be like um
17:29 - a profile image right here so pretty
17:31 - much we're thinking about three diffs
17:32 - that we need to go ahead and create
17:34 - beautiful all right three dips let's
17:36 - think about this now
17:37 - inside here in terms of container i'm
17:40 - i'm actually going to change this name
17:41 - to not to be
17:42 - contained about i want to change this to
17:43 - be nav so nav
17:45 - and by the way to actually make it
17:46 - happen to this out you see how i just
17:48 - added
17:49 - at the same time here's a cool trick
17:51 - click command d
17:53 - in vs code or ctrl d
17:56 - and it will select all these things
17:57 - automatically for you and you just
17:59 - change on the fly
18:01 - see for example let me see see
18:04 - it changes everything on the fly how
18:07 - cool is that huh
18:08 - give a thumbs up if you think if you
18:09 - think that's cool even though something
18:10 - i think that if you think if you think
18:12 - that's awesome i think it's pretty cool
18:13 - yeah yeah yeah yeah
18:15 - all right there we go beautiful
18:17 - beautiful
18:18 - sweet all right so now instead of doing
18:20 - style that did i want to do style.nav
18:23 - so it's going to be navigation bar and
18:25 - that's just a little more user friendly
18:27 - with html5 that's pretty much the reason
18:29 - why
18:30 - once we've done that let's go ahead and
18:32 - do the following um
18:34 - well let's go ahead and create our
18:36 - actual logo so i'm going to create a
18:37 - logo here
18:39 - logo again it's going also going to be a
18:41 - style component source
18:42 - with a certain image no image just yet
18:45 - okay
18:46 - okay logo let's go ahead and do this
18:48 - const
18:49 - const logo right cons logo style the
18:53 - image
18:55 - logo right there
18:58 - equals oh styled dot
19:01 - image right there that's an image right
19:03 - again
19:05 - and again these quotes right here these
19:08 - quotes this call are called template
19:09 - that rule pretty much right called
19:11 - backticks
19:12 - and this is where we put our css inside
19:13 - here all right beautiful then inside
19:15 - here we're going to give it a width
19:17 - of width of 80 pixels so width
19:21 - 80 pixels all right now with
19:24 - now with guys okay with i'm not the best
19:29 - uh you know i'm not the best typer i
19:31 - will say that
19:32 - with 80 pixels okay all right so
19:35 - so we have the logo i can see there's
19:37 - nothing again does not show up on here
19:39 - but here's what we can do all right now
19:41 - let's go ahead and focus on
19:42 - the nav menu all right so we have the
19:44 - nav menu here
19:46 - nav menu let's create this other
19:48 - component now menu
19:55 - nav menu and we're going to create it
19:57 - into a div so it's the same thing here
19:59 - you see the cool thing about style
20:01 - components is that i'm creating css
20:03 - within the actual javascript file i'll
20:05 - have to go back and forth between two
20:07 - files
20:08 - nav menu equals
20:12 - styled.diff done done

24:41 - below
24:42 - all right let's go ahead and create the
24:43 - image right so what what i need to do is
24:45 - this
24:46 - for the source it will actually be dash
24:48 - images
24:50 - dash logo dash logo.svg
24:54 - now where is it coming from you see
24:57 - images right here
24:58 - local svg directly from here
25:03 - from here right here okay that's where
25:05 - it's coming from all right
25:06 - all right let's go and save this one
25:09 - refresh
25:10 - boom right there we got the disney plus
25:13 - logo just like that how cool is that
25:16 - right
25:17 - all right beautiful let's go ahead and
25:18 - maybe add some pen into this you see how
25:20 - it's all the way on the top
25:22 - i don't like that instead what i'm going
25:24 - to do is i'm going to center it so to
25:26 - center it i'm actually going to focus on
25:27 - the main
25:28 - nav the nav is this whole div right here
25:31 - okay that's the whole nav and i'm going
25:34 - to tell a display flex right
25:36 - so display file is going to allow us to
25:39 - very easily to very easily
25:42 - very easily structure our code or
25:45 - structure our
25:46 - front end this playflex and so
25:49 - save that see that puts it right there
25:51 - and i'm going to say align item center
25:57 - item center center to center it
25:59 - vertically
26:01 - boom see now center vertically right
26:02 - here i'm going to give some padding
26:05 - i'm going to say padding 0 36 pixels
26:09 - right pending is zero times right now
26:11 - what is all this zero means top
26:13 - and bottom this means zero pixels for
26:15 - top and bottom thirty six plus so this
26:17 - means
26:17 - left and right padding okay that means
26:19 - left and
26:20 - right padding okay that's what that
26:22 - means all right let's go ahead and save
26:24 - that
26:25 - all right beautiful that looks so much
26:27 - better now guys check this out that
26:28 - looks so good
26:29 - all right i love that so logo is there
26:31 - let's now focus on the nav
26:34 - menu that one is a little bit going to
26:35 - be trickier okay
26:37 - and then you will have a few things okay
26:40 - the first thing will be
26:41 - is every single icon here that you see
26:44 - right
26:44 - every single icon what it is is is
26:47 - basically this right here is an a tag
26:50 - this is an a tag and inside here we have
26:52 - a logo
26:53 - and a span tag so let's just go ahead
26:55 - and take a look at this oh if i say here
26:57 - for example
26:58 - if i say oop let's go remove this for a
27:00 - second here
27:01 - boom i'm going to say a boom
27:06 - i'm going to give it a that logo you see
27:08 - which is this image right here right
27:10 - this image right here i'm going to say
27:13 - here
27:14 - image source is
27:17 - equal to beautiful and let's do it
27:20 - go to images images
27:24 - dash home icon home dash
27:27 - icon dot svg
27:31 - done okay all right and then let's go
27:34 - ahead and do a span here
27:37 - all right and we'll give it home
27:40 - done so a tag home so if i say this
27:44 - let's see what this turns out to
27:46 - oh it looks so horrible that's okay
27:49 - no problem whatsoever okay so you can
27:51 - see the icon is there which is great
27:53 - but of course you know the fact the
27:54 - homepage is here the homepage we don't
27:56 - really see that's mainly because of the
27:57 - color right we need to give it a color
27:59 - that's that's pretty much white all
28:00 - right so a few things that i want you
28:02 - guys to think about
28:04 - is the following let's go ahead and
28:06 - focus on this home icon partially
28:09 - the span needs to be color white so to
28:11 - make a color white
28:12 - we need to go to the following let's
28:15 - make the whole
28:16 - thing color white what i mean by that is
28:18 - let's go to index.css
28:20 - all right and this body let's give the
28:23 - full color to
28:23 - white see this one
28:26 - white right it makes this homepage now
28:29 - white
28:30 - see right there it just showed up just
28:31 - like that just like
28:33 - that beautiful all right
28:37 - now let's make this icon
28:41 - be the left side of this home icon right
28:43 - how do we structure from being like this
28:45 - to being like this right
28:47 - that's the question well it's very
28:49 - simple it's all using this play flex so
28:51 - i'm going to go back to my header
28:56 - i'm going to back to my header.js okay
28:59 - how the gs and i will say the following
29:04 - where am i where am i okay yes no menu
29:07 - so here what i'm gonna do
29:08 - display flex
29:12 - if i want display flex on this right now
29:15 - that's not really
29:16 - changing anything here right it's still
29:18 - home is like this uh instead what i will
29:20 - do is the following i will say a
29:21 - here you see and then here i will say
29:23 - display facts again the a
29:25 - we're targeting this a tag that's the
29:27 - link tag right
29:28 - so a will say display flex
29:32 - display flex awesome save that
29:35 - boom you see now this icon all of a
29:38 - sudden now
29:38 - it's very different it's left to right
29:40 - instead of top to bottom just simple as
29:41 - that
29:42 - all right so that's good i'm going to
29:44 - make this
29:47 - all right beautiful right there okay
29:49 - that's the play flex then what i'm going
29:51 - to do is i'm going to align this
29:52 - and say align items items
29:56 - center save it done you see now this
29:59 - home icon is centered right here
30:00 - together with the icon itself okay next
30:03 - up let's go and add some padding to it
30:04 - some say padding
30:07 - padding 0 12 pixels and what this does
30:10 - is this is
30:10 - going to add padding on the left and the
30:12 - right hand side
30:13 - okay beautiful next up let's do the
30:16 - image let's go ahead and change this
30:17 - image because it's way
30:19 - too large right this is this is our this
30:21 - image local
30:22 - so inside style components i'm going to
30:25 - say image
30:26 - now i may wonder now how the hack is
30:28 - like are we able to
30:29 - target all these css like this well
30:32 - that's the power of style components
30:34 - what we can do is we can we can target
30:37 - it basically our elements like a tree
30:39 - for example here we're targeting the a
30:42 - tag within
30:43 - the nav menu div here we're targeting
30:46 - the image tag within
30:47 - the a tag you see so we can do that in
30:50 - style components
30:52 - right for images let's make the image
30:54 - here height
30:56 - of 20 pixels and whenever we give a
30:57 - height uh the width changes
30:59 - automatically
31:01 - beautiful oh so much better so much
31:03 - better
31:04 - so much better all right so much better
31:06 - i like it so much more
31:07 - beautiful we got that portion let's now
31:10 - go to
31:10 - the uh the span tag okay so
31:14 - span
31:17 - okay and then here uh pretty much again
31:20 - nothing much let's change the font size
31:22 - here so we'll say font size not done
31:23 - size font always
31:26 - one size okay font size 13 pixels
31:31 - you guys are good still on on zoom yes
31:33 - you guys are still great yes yes yes yes
31:35 - beautiful yes give me a hum
31:36 - hands up hands up hey let's go beautiful
31:39 - that's what i'm talking about
31:40 - font size 13 pixels let's give it some
31:44 - letter spacing
31:47 - letter spacing
31:50 - and i'm after david if you have any
31:51 - issues just speak out loud and i'll be
31:53 - able to resolve anything okay
31:55 - 1.42 pixels
31:59 - all right and so forth let me see so now
32:01 - you see it changes a little bit there's
32:03 - a little bit of a difference now in
32:04 - terms of how it looks like which is
32:05 - pretty great
32:06 - all right now let's go ahead all we need
32:08 - to do now at this point is very simple
32:10 - is well i pretty much just need to copy
32:12 - this stuff so let's go to here let's
32:15 - remove this it puts all at the bottom we
32:16 - don't need this at all
32:18 - actually we don't even need this portion
32:19 - too either honestly so
32:21 - a tag command c i'm going to duplicate
32:24 - this command v
32:25 - right and instead of down those this for

32:30 - search right and this will be instead of
32:32 - homework and this will be search icon
32:36 - search icon all right save that

35:12 - uh let me do this here and this this is
35:14 - going to be called the user image
35:16 - so here we'll say user user imager
35:20 - right and so forth now with this image
35:23 - let's go ahead and go down
35:25 - here and we'll say const
35:28 - user image is equal to styled.diff
35:34 - oh no not that div actually that image
35:37 - it's gonna be an image type component
35:38 - you see
35:39 - so with style components you can have
35:40 - different type components images
35:42 - you can have spans you can have divs
35:44 - right nav
35:45 - basically any html component you can
35:47 - have you can have that with a style
35:49 - component
35:50 - all right now on the user image
35:54 - the image we're going to use for the
35:56 - time being is gonna be just this one
35:57 - right here it's gonna be
35:59 - you can use any image you want
36:00 - technically but i have this one right
36:02 - here
36:03 - and hopefully we can have a monitor
36:06 - david put in the chat
36:08 - there we go and that's going to be
36:11 - pretty that's actually my image
36:13 - it's actually me that's not all right
36:15 - let's see
36:16 - let's see how does it look like oh let's
36:18 - go there's me
36:20 - if you have your own picture use your
36:22 - own picture i highly recommend that you
36:24 - use a square picture
36:25 - that's gonna be very very helpful to you
36:26 - okay
36:29 - all right so that's gonna be sick okay
36:31 - so do that
36:32 - now of course we're not done yet uh we
36:34 - need to do is let's go ahead and make
36:36 - this
36:36 - a little bit better well let's go ahead
36:38 - and set the width so
36:40 - check this out guys if i want to edit
36:42 - this style for this
36:43 - i hit command and click on this you see
36:45 - anomalous styles
36:47 - check this out how cool is that huh
36:48 - command click on the actual user image
36:51 - i think in windows is control click i
36:53 - think so
36:54 - or windows click i'm not sure try one of
36:56 - those so inside the user image i'm gonna
36:58 - say width
36:59 - what 48 pixels okay
37:03 - height height also 48 pixels
37:09 - done save it all right now it's a bit
37:11 - smaller which is great
37:12 - and then i'm going to give the border
37:14 - radius
37:16 - for this radius of 50 now
37:19 - what that does is that gives the biscuit
37:21 - a circle that makes it into a circle
37:24 - because the border radius basically has
37:25 - the cur the beautiful most beautiful
37:27 - curvature on the
37:28 - on all the corners right you see right
37:29 - here fifty percent of the full image is
37:31 - gonna be
37:32 - basically curved up that's what i mean
37:34 - next thing i'm to make it to cursor
37:35 - pointer the reason why we do that is
37:37 - because
37:37 - so it looks like or it feels like you
37:39 - know a
37:40 - button beautiful all right
37:44 - now oh let's go all right last thing
37:47 - look at this you see how this icon is
37:49 - all always left inside well
37:51 - what i can do is i can actually expand
37:53 - the nav menu
37:55 - then that menu right here to push this
37:57 - icon
37:58 - all the way to the right hand side by
38:00 - using what what do you guys think we can
38:01 - do here
38:02 - let me know what do you guys think put
38:03 - in the chat what do you guys think we
38:04 - can do
38:05 - to push this nav menu right here
38:08 - all the way to the right hand side well
38:10 - that's very simple actually
38:13 - i can go to the nav menu and i can say
38:16 - the nav menu
38:17 - hey you know what let's give the flex of
38:19 - a one look at this
38:21 - another menu let's say flex one
38:24 - and what that does that's biscuit says
38:26 - look at this that says hey this
38:28 - menu is the most important thing right
38:30 - and you want to expand it as much as
38:31 - possible
38:32 - and so that's what that what that does
38:34 - okay
38:35 - i'm going to give it a small margin left
38:37 - 20 pixels
38:40 - margin left margin left 20 pixels
38:45 - ah margin
38:49 - dash left i'm gonna give it 20 pixels
38:54 - any pixels right here uh 25 actually
38:59 - give some spacing on the left inside
39:01 - there you go just to give spacing
39:02 - and then the last i want to do is for
39:04 - each a tag i'm going to give it a cursor
39:06 - pointer
39:13 - all right cursor pointer and what that
39:16 - does is gonna make it like a hand
39:17 - there we go now it's a hand you see that
39:19 - right there now it's a hand
39:21 - okay but okay we're not done yet i also
39:23 - want to
39:24 - make this into a line item center so
39:26 - this basically will
39:27 - here we'll center it vertically so
39:29 - online items
39:34 - might not change might not change a
39:36 - little bit just see that does not change
39:37 - much honestly right here
39:39 - beautiful right there all right so
39:41 - alignment center and that's looking
39:42 - pretty good won't you say so what do you
39:44 - guys think
39:45 - let me know let me know in the comments
39:46 - below let me know in the chat what are
39:47 - you guys saying so far that's looking
39:49 - really really good so far
39:51 - all right i like it next up
39:54 - all right next one let's go ahead and
39:56 - make that a beautiful animation that we
39:58 - have which is this one
40:00 - so this is going to be really really
40:01 - cool the way we'd make this happen
40:03 - is really cool really cool all right
40:06 - monique says beautiful i like it thank
40:08 - you monique
40:09 - all right let me go and check up on
40:11 - youtube here for a second here
40:13 - all right that's what i'm talking
40:15 - nicholas says awesome sweet flex
40:18 - ah you guys are amazing i like it nice
40:21 - bro
40:22 - javier says nice bro
40:25 - all right all right now a few things
40:28 - that we need to make
40:29 - to make it kind of like uh you know
40:33 - to make that portion happen so um check
40:36 - this one out
40:37 - this is going to be like a really cool
40:38 - trick that maybe you have now learned
40:40 - before
40:40 - but inside the
40:43 - um here inside this pan this pan here's
40:47 - what we can do
40:50 - we can use something called um after
40:53 - so what does it do right here i'm gonna
40:54 - say here i'm gonna say this
40:56 - this after now what this
41:00 - adds is this adds almost like a div
41:03 - this adds a div right here so i'm gonna
41:04 - say after i'm gonna give a content
41:06 - and i'll explain what again what it does
41:08 - in a second here content of empty string
41:11 - okay and i'm going to give it a height
41:14 - so imagine like a normal div
41:17 - height of two pixels i have two pixels
41:21 - and i'm going to say background is white
41:24 - background is white
41:29 - okay and then what i'm going to do is
41:31 - i'm going to position okay well for now
41:33 - it's going to see
41:34 - what does that do and let's see refresh
41:38 - ah nothing so much because we need to
41:39 - give the width so let's give it a
41:41 - actually give the contour like hello
41:44 - jello see there you go there it is right
41:47 - here
41:48 - it's called jello see and it's back on
41:50 - color white if i remove this background
41:52 - color white
41:54 - jello now what it does if i inspect the
41:58 - element on this one
42:01 - here's what it does is it adds a div
42:05 - after the ending of everything so check
42:07 - this out if i go to span you see there's
42:09 - home
42:09 - and then there's a after imagine this
42:12 - after
42:13 - almost like a div like a div
42:18 - you see and it has the content yellow
42:20 - and a height of two pixels
42:21 - and with that we can actually be very
42:24 - very
42:25 - very useful we can actually be very
42:27 - smart with that
42:28 - let's go and save this beautiful
42:31 - all right let's go and do that save that
42:34 - all right and of course we don't need
42:36 - jello at this point
42:38 - right no i mean unless you guys like
42:39 - jello who likes jello here anybody likes
42:41 - jello here i like jello
42:42 - i'm a big fan of jello i love jello
42:44 - that's my favorite favorite type of food
42:46 - okay
42:47 - love jello all right
42:50 - beautiful there we go that's what i'm
42:53 - talking about
42:54 - so let's go ahead and do the following
42:56 - now so
42:58 - how am i going to position this you see
43:00 - how this is positioned inside here
43:01 - especially at the bottom
43:03 - how do we make that work well let's
43:06 - think about it
43:07 - i'm going to use something called
43:08 - position absolute so here's what i'll do
43:10 - i'll do position absolute
43:13 - absolute absolute
43:16 - right here and i'll give a top
43:19 - of zero of zero
43:23 - and i'll explain well how that works out
43:24 - a little bit top left
43:26 - of zero right
43:30 - of zero and then
43:33 - bottom is actually going to be minus six
43:37 - pixels so y minus now you might be
43:39 - asking
43:40 - well a few reasons why i
43:44 - save this and you can see right there
43:46 - it's still not shown now because why
43:48 - we need to give it if you're going to
43:51 - position absolute something
43:52 - it needs to be positioned absolute to
43:54 - what to a relative
43:56 - object well let's make the same the
43:59 - the span position relative it's like you
44:01 - have to give it a parent
44:02 - to cling on to
44:06 - right so let's go ahead and save that
44:09 - position relative content high 20 pixels
44:12 - okay okay okay opacity of one
44:15 - background color white all right let's
44:19 - go and refresh this
44:21 - still not there let me see make sure
44:22 - it's all that it's all good let me see
44:24 - inspect that one on this one
44:30 - home oh
44:34 - because i did not put this correctly
44:37 - there you go boom right there
44:40 - you see now it's at the top okay it's at
44:44 - the top
44:44 - why because i i thought this top zero
44:47 - don't need this
44:48 - remove this one tab zero boom now to the
44:52 - bottom you see that right there look
44:53 - now it's at the bottom so we have this
44:55 - line here that was created
44:57 - how well we said that okay you have this
45:00 - div right here
45:02 - it's called a span okay we have this div
45:04 - and we said hey
45:06 - you know what let's all let's go ahead
45:07 - and create another div we're using after
45:09 - but let's make that div which is this
45:12 - one right here
45:13 - let's make this small div let's give it
45:14 - a height of two pixels
45:17 - a background color of white and let's
45:19 - absolute position it to
45:21 - the left where there's no space to the
45:22 - left there's no space to the right
45:25 - and from the bottom it's like for
45:26 - example hey
45:28 - from the left create no spacing from the
45:30 - right there's no spacing
45:32 - and then from the bottom there's only
45:36 - negative six pixels meaning it will push
45:38 - it down it will actually push down the
45:40 - div
45:40 - below this band component
45:44 - that's a really cool part you need to
45:45 - understand
45:47 - right it will push down below the span
45:49 - component okay let's go ahead and
45:50 - continue on
45:51 - all right awesome sweet sweet sweet
45:53 - sweet sweets with you guys still good
45:55 - yes yes yes yes yes beautiful beautiful
45:56 - beautiful all right all right derek i
45:59 - think you're still good alex you're
46:00 - still a good jared i think look
46:01 - you're still good as well beautiful
46:04 - leonard as well
46:05 - and same as christian all right sweet
46:07 - sweet tweet
46:08 - all right all right now the way we need
46:10 - to start out now of course when we go
46:12 - ahead and build stuff
46:13 - like this of course you see how the does
46:15 - not show up
46:16 - until until we actually do something
46:18 - about it right until we hover over it
46:20 - so how do we make that happen well um
46:23 - very simple very simple let's do
46:25 - initially we're going to give the
46:26 - passive zero
46:28 - passive zero passive zero
46:33 - and then we'll do transform skill x0 so
46:37 - what does this do
46:40 - scale x0 this is going to scale
46:43 - the i'm going to go ahead and comments
46:45 - opacity here for a second
46:46 - so it's going to scale the div to zero
46:50 - if i do 0.5
46:51 - it's going to make it 0.5 you see that
46:53 - right there 0.5
46:55 - as simple as that right right if i make
46:58 - it for example
46:59 - 1 then it's going to be the full thing
47:03 - right there see but if i do 0 it's going
47:06 - to make it 0.
47:07 - okay now in our case i'm going to make
47:08 - it 0 and also passes zero
47:10 - and then what here's what we'll do on
47:12 - the hover of span
47:15 - on the hover actually have the whole a
47:17 - tag which is inside here
47:18 - look at this i'll do the following this
47:20 - this this will say hover
47:23 - voila all right we'll do span
47:28 - after right
47:31 - right and the hover of this of this span
47:33 - after we'll say
47:36 - transform
47:38 - transfer scale
47:41 - x into one so we go from
47:44 - zero to one scale
47:47 - when basically from zero width to the
47:50 - full 100
47:51 - width that's what that means and then
47:54 - i'm going to give opacity
47:56 - of one look at that
47:59 - all right let's try it let's try it oh
48:02 - oh does not work that's okay that's okay
48:05 - because
48:06 - we need to give it a transform from what
48:08 - to what to try this out i need to get
48:10 - this transform origin from left
48:13 - to center let's refresh again
48:17 - oh two two two that's not really
48:20 - happening here let's go ahead and see
48:22 - what's going on here so we have
48:23 - a tag that's on here on the hover of
48:26 - that span recon the span
48:30 - which is that one right after
48:35 - transform
48:39 - transform scale x
48:42 - one oh right here right there that's the
48:45 - one
48:47 - boom boom boom boom look at that see
48:49 - boom
48:50 - boom boom so it shows up on the hover
48:52 - you see opacity want to transfer scale
48:54 - wax one
48:55 - but let's make it even beautiful
48:57 - beautiful look at this
48:59 - all right i'm going to add a transition
49:04 - and here's the transition this is a
49:06 - special transition and this says
49:07 - transition everything all all attributes
49:10 - at 250 milliseconds
49:12 - and this is a special type of tradition
49:13 - right this right here basically says
49:16 - what type of a transition there's like a
49:17 - linear transition
49:19 - this is this right here number has a
49:21 - special temperatures and maybe for
49:22 - example a month
49:23 - maybe guess you can put it down the chat
49:25 - and zoom this specific
49:26 - text right here right cubic biz
49:31 - right here all right so it's a really
49:33 - cool transition that
49:35 - if i now apply this oh
49:38 - oh oh let's go let's go
49:42 - boom boom boom boom boom boom
49:48 - look at that guys
49:52 - how cool is that
49:56 - look at that
50:01 - how cool is that what do you guys think
50:03 - huh that's pretty awesome what'd you
50:04 - think so
50:04 - that's pretty awesome you can actually
50:06 - have this so guess that it's this one
50:07 - right here
50:08 - pubic bizarre right a little bit desire
50:12 - use that one you can do linear as well
50:14 - but uh you can do
50:15 - linear but we don't want that that's not
50:18 - not not not too much fun
50:19 - all right so save that and that's it
50:22 - our header now at this point is
50:25 - officially
50:26 - done that's it it's done done so that's
50:29 - it
50:29 - comprende all right all right so that's
50:32 - all good
50:34 - header is finished okay header is
50:36 - finished and let's go ahead and go to
50:38 - here i get and i'm going to actually
50:40 - save it so i'm going to say add header
50:41 - so i'm going to save this inside the git
50:44 - and i want you guys to get users
50:45 - doing stuff with this as well so add
50:46 - header that's going to save it into our
50:49 - git
50:50 - all right and that's it we don't have to
50:52 - worry about anything else at this point
50:54 - besides that
50:59 - that looks so good by the way that looks
51:00 - so good that's so looks so good
51:02 - well don't you guys think it looks
51:03 - awesome raising everything this looks
51:05 - amazing yeah
51:06 - and it's the way it's done is very
51:08 - intricate too it's all using css you see
51:11 - right this transform origin is saying
51:12 - hey go from the left corner
51:14 - to the center right here you see kind of
51:16 - uh from left corner to center
51:17 - that's the same the translation say
51:19 - transition all of this and the transform
51:21 - says
51:22 - scale it from zero to one
51:25 - that's it that's all i was saying that's
51:27 - as simple as that
51:29 - all right let me see now disappointing
51:32 - youtube
51:33 - we have 356 people on youtube let's go
51:36 - 423 people on youtube that is beautiful
51:38 - amazing
51:38 - amazing excited to see all of you wow
51:41 - wow that's actually pretty great
51:43 - all right so that's what we have this at
51:45 - this point okay
51:46 - i know everybody looks yeah it's amazing
51:48 - it's cool that's cool it's cool
51:50 - i like it okay so that's part one let's
51:52 - now look at the home page okay
51:55 - the home page now let me go ahead and
51:57 - focus put this on the right hand side
51:58 - and put them on the right-hand side all
52:01 - right home page
52:02 - is done check mark all right next up
52:06 - header is done check mark next up is
52:08 - home page hemp homepage is going to be a
52:09 - little bit more difficult but that's
52:11 - completely okay
52:12 - let's go to home page all right um so
52:15 - at the homepage we'll have a few things
52:16 - all right of course uh let's start out
52:19 - with a container here like we always
52:20 - like to do so let's go and import style
52:22 - components here
52:23 - import styled from
52:26 - from what style components dash
52:30 - components all right sweet import staff
52:33 - the style components
52:35 - let's do the following so const
52:37 - container
52:39 - equal styled da what style.differ now
52:43 - oh actually no style domain so main is
52:46 - actually a great
52:47 - it's a very html5 friendly basically it
52:50 - tells
52:51 - google or any other browser that this is
52:53 - the main
52:54 - content right so it's the same thing as
52:56 - saying div except that uh you know
52:58 - underneath the hood uh google likes to
53:00 - read that so that's how you say main
53:02 - all right now for this one let's do the
53:06 - following for this one okay
53:07 - um a few things a few things
53:14 - all right a few things we need to think
53:16 - about here uh first things first let's
53:18 - do a min height so
53:20 - what we need to do min height and height
53:22 - here
53:24 - so what is the main height uh really
53:26 - it's the following um
53:29 - remember how this height is 70 pixels
53:32 - so this right here is 70 pixels okay
53:34 - that's 70 pixels
53:35 - all right then this means that this will
53:38 - be
53:39 - what the rest correct so that this right
53:41 - here means will be
53:42 - those will be the rest of the the height
53:44 - right so that's what that's what that
53:46 - means
53:46 - well to make that happen here's what we
53:49 - can do
53:50 - i can say calc so css can actually
53:53 - calculate stuff for you
53:54 - i can say a hundred vh that means a
53:57 - hundred
53:57 - vertical height 100 that's the full
54:01 - width
54:01 - from top to bottom of the view view
54:04 - height viewport
54:06 - that's the browser height minus 70
54:09 - pixels
54:10 - right so that's the height
54:13 - i mean height is this full height
54:15 - beautiful we got that
54:17 - all right all right so we have that and
54:19 - then
54:20 - and then let's add a padding to it
54:23 - padding
54:25 - padding and i'm going to go to zero calc
54:27 - here
54:28 - and all this is saying is this is 3.5
54:30 - view or
54:32 - vertical uh kind of view width
54:35 - 2.4 or 3.5 actually 3.5
54:38 - view width plus 5 pixels that's just
54:41 - pretty much
54:42 - it's nothing too crazy just a very
54:43 - simple calculation so
54:45 - this means top bottom 0 pixels left and
54:48 - right
54:49 - is this one right here sorry all right
54:52 - now how do we actually see this well
54:54 - it's very simple let's go ahead and
54:55 - actually add a background color here
54:57 - background blue let's see our
55:02 - let's see background blue okay does not
55:04 - show up on there
55:06 - background color blue blue is it there
55:08 - or no let me see inspect element in this
55:10 - one
55:11 - let me see inspect that one here
55:14 - uh body root
55:18 - app
55:25 - oh here's why the reason why it's not
55:27 - working is because remember what we did
55:28 - here is
55:29 - we forgot to put the container so
55:30 - container is actually being used here
55:32 - instead of div
55:34 - container boom
55:38 - container nice i like oh
55:41 - that's cool let's remove this hideous
55:43 - color please
55:45 - i don't like that okay so so that's all
55:48 - good now
55:48 - the color that we do want to use however
55:50 - is going to be like a home color
55:52 - a background color it's going to be
55:53 - actually this color right here so what i
55:54 - want you guys to do
55:55 - to add a nice background color is go to
55:58 - initial.css here
56:00 - and this is css here and let's go to
56:04 - body and do here background color
56:08 - right here hashtag zero four zero seven
56:10 - one four it's a nice color that we're
56:12 - going to use for the disney plus clone
56:14 - okay
56:14 - that's yeah that's everything nothing
56:16 - too crazy just
56:17 - just a very simple one okay just about
56:20 - that all right beautiful
56:21 - all right next up so that's all good
56:23 - let's go ahead and go to
56:26 - home.js all right i like it
56:29 - i like it like that
56:32 - i like it like okay anyways
56:35 - anyways guys all right let me see so
56:38 - that's all good
56:39 - next up is gonna be watch next up is
56:41 - going to be
56:43 - we need to now add the background image
56:46 - now if we look at our disney plus clone
56:49 - make it a little bit bigger you see we
56:50 - have this background image that looks
56:52 - that's in here
56:53 - see this as i scroll you see it's there
56:56 - you see that
56:57 - as i scroll there's a background image
57:00 - in there
57:00 - you can have to look very close in here
57:02 - you see it's a background image
57:04 - so how do we make that work well um
57:07 - let's take a look at it
57:09 - what we're going to do is we're going to
57:10 - use this after before stuff that we
57:12 - talked about before okay
57:14 - before that's that's a fun that's a
57:16 - funny pun
57:17 - funny partners before all right
57:21 - done before and it basically will add a
57:25 - div
57:26 - before the container check this out i'm
57:28 - going to say background
57:30 - background here now see url boom
57:34 - done okay i'm going to give it dash
57:37 - images
57:38 - dash images a dash home
57:41 - dash background
57:45 - that what that png done okay
57:49 - now so that's the url i'm gonna say
57:52 - center that's the vertically center
57:55 - horizontally centered
57:56 - right and then i'm going to say what um
57:59 - center dash
58:02 - where am i right okay center then i want
58:05 - to
58:06 - cover cover
58:09 - and then i'm going to say no repeat and
58:13 - fixed
58:14 - so no repeat means do not repeat this no
58:17 - repeat do not repeat
58:19 - repeat uh this image
58:23 - right and it can be a fixed image now
58:26 - half fixed we'll talk about that in a
58:27 - second here
58:29 - all right now it's still not there of
58:31 - course it's not here right you don't see
58:33 - you don't you only see oh that's not
58:34 - good
58:36 - right you still see only this no problem
58:37 - whatsoever right
58:39 - so let's do this right so again it's url
58:42 - images whole background png center
58:45 - center
58:46 - cover no repeat fix no changes so far
58:48 - don't worry i'm gonna do content here
58:51 - check this out now content nothing just
58:54 - how we usually like to do it
58:56 - okay now again if i add content for
58:58 - example like yo
59:00 - save that yo see it adds a
59:03 - before right there see let's go ahead
59:06 - and do it like this
59:08 - right there i think i'm going to
59:09 - position absolute it
59:11 - that's the cool part position position
59:14 - absolute right all right
59:18 - right and i'm going to say now the
59:20 - following top 0
59:24 - left 0 0
59:28 - then i'm going to say right zero
59:32 - right and then bottom
59:35 - uh bottom zero right
59:39 - save that now still nothing happens
59:42 - why because the following because we
59:44 - need to make it absolute to what
59:46 - i need to make this position relative
59:51 - save that all right save it let's see
59:53 - let's see position relative
59:56 - background is this content is this and
59:59 - fixed the mississippi absolute
60:02 - two to two refresh this i don't really
60:05 - see that background image there there's
60:07 - no bueno
60:08 - let me see url am i doing this right
60:10 - bottom
60:11 - zero i'm gonna say z index
60:16 - minus one
60:22 - all right i don't see the background
60:24 - image just yet don't worry about that
60:25 - we'll
60:26 - make that happen a little bit here let's
60:29 - see i think has to
60:30 - put this background let me let me try
60:31 - this
60:36 - for a second here
60:39 - boom
60:43 - okay so there was a little bit of mix up
60:46 - here
60:47 - so i guess i did it wrong in terms of
60:49 - how we set the background so here's what
60:50 - we'll do
60:51 - background url right there images home
60:54 - background.png
60:56 - center center this horizontal vertical
60:58 - center this is basically the type of
61:00 - positioning here right
61:01 - this is background position cover right
61:04 - we need to add a dash here
61:06 - so dash cover
61:09 - cover and after that we say no repeat
61:13 - and then we say fixed okay so thick
61:16 - fixed means basically
61:17 - fixed on the page so if i scroll if i
61:20 - scroll it will always be fixed on there
61:21 - okay
61:22 - that's what that means guys if i scroll
61:23 - it will always be fixed
61:26 - under that's what that means look how
61:28 - good this looks already
61:29 - it's so good so good i like it
61:33 - that looks beautiful and again how does
61:36 - it work again right because if you think
61:37 - about
61:38 - this let's look at our rectangle here
61:41 - boom there's a rectangle right that's
61:44 - our home let's go ahead and force this
61:45 - here
61:46 - this right here is our home component
61:48 - you can see right then what we did
61:50 - is when we did before
61:53 - we added another div
61:56 - right there's no name for it right and
61:59 - we give it a content of nothing
62:01 - and we did position absolute top zero
62:03 - left zero right zero bottom zero
62:05 - meaning that means that it's going to be
62:08 - zero pixels from the left zero pixels
62:11 - from the top
62:12 - zero pixels from the bottom
62:15 - from the bottom right zip is from the
62:18 - right
62:18 - so when you do that you stretch the
62:21 - whole div
62:23 - to the end of this dip like so oops
62:27 - to this day right here that's what you
62:28 - do and so now we have this extra div
62:31 - this blue absolute it will not move
62:33 - anywhere and it will be behind
62:35 - all content all the time because we give
62:38 - it a z
62:39 - index of minus one that's why okay
62:42 - so i want you guys to really think about
62:44 - that z in this minus one is a big deal
62:46 - this is
62:47 - z 0-1 you will later on if you will see
62:48 - when i add content to it like if i do
62:50 - for example if i forgive me
62:51 - let's remove this for a second here
62:55 - see the home was gone right if i'd do
62:59 - zms1
63:00 - home was out there you see that's why
63:02 - that's why that's so important
63:04 - okay and honestly that's it
63:09 - you're done on this container home now
63:11 - of course no you're not pretty much done
63:13 - but this is looking now very good raise
63:16 - your hand if you're still with me are
63:17 - you still with me raise your hand
63:18 - yeah you guys still with me how
63:20 - beautiful is this turn out to be
63:23 - just within about what one hour at this
63:25 - point within one hour we've gone so far
63:27 - now
63:28 - exactly it's beautiful all right and on
63:31 - youtube guys i know you guys are killing
63:33 - it as well
63:33 - it's a lot of fun all right so we got
63:36 - that portion we got this
63:40 - i like it i like it like that
63:44 - okay anyways all right um so now next
63:47 - portion is going to be the image
63:49 - slider which is going to be oh this is
63:52 - going to be so much fun you guys are you
63:53 - ready for the image slider
63:56 - oh that's gonna be a fun one it's gonna
63:58 - be a fun one because i know you guys
63:59 - will be confused
64:01 - that's why that's why exactly why so but
64:04 - it's okay we'll
64:05 - we'll do this together don't worry about
64:07 - that so
64:08 - image slider so what are we going to use
64:10 - for this image slide well the first
64:11 - thing to do is we need to create the
64:12 - actual component so let's go ahead and
64:14 - do inside the components folder
64:15 - right click new file and we'll say what
64:18 - we'll say image
64:19 - image slider dot
64:22 - js done all right let's do rsce
64:26 - to create a component all right and
64:28 - we'll say image
64:29 - slider here all right
64:32 - save that beautiful image slider and of
64:35 - course it's not here because we need to
64:37 - import it
64:38 - so let's go back to our home.js which is
64:40 - right here
64:41 - and let's import that right just how we
64:43 - always import we like to import so
64:44 - import what image image
64:49 - slider from what from
64:54 - going to be from what is it guys what is
64:56 - it
64:57 - component right what is it well
65:00 - directly from here because our image
65:01 - slide is inside this folder components
65:03 - folder
65:04 - and our homepage inside this folder so
65:05 - we'll say dot dash image slider
65:08 - save that let's go and create the
65:10 - component side here now so say
65:11 - image slider
65:15 - done all right boom image sliders right
65:18 - here all right so
65:19 - that's pretty good i'm pretty happy
65:21 - about that how that's turning out
65:22 - all right it's really really good
65:25 - actually i like that a lot
65:26 - all right so that's really cool so and
65:29 - now let's actually work inside the image
65:31 - slider
65:32 - let's go into here but now we're inside
65:35 - here
65:36 - okay all right
65:40 - inside here a few things we need to do
65:42 - what we're going to use to do to do my
65:44 - slider is something called
65:45 - react slick check this out
65:49 - sorry let me get some water i'm dying
65:52 - out here
65:57 - oh yeah you guys don't want me to
65:59 - die right
66:00 - i hope so i hope not
66:04 - all right so there we go so it's called
66:06 - react slick and it will give you some
66:08 - examples here
66:09 - but basically it's a react module that's
66:12 - been built for us to make beautiful
66:13 - sliders
66:14 - so right here reacts to the
66:15 - documentation right there
66:17 - boom see right there and this looks
66:19 - pretty much exactly the same as what
66:20 - we're trying to build
66:21 - and it actually tells us how we need to
66:23 - build this there's a settings there's a
66:25 - component right here
66:26 - there's settings we need to give it and
66:27 - then we just return the div you can see
66:30 - we will use the slider component that's
66:31 - this one
66:33 - right that's like opponent and then
66:34 - we'll use it where we'll use it inside
66:37 - here right there
66:40 - right so that's how we need to do so the
66:42 - first thing we need to do is we need to
66:43 - install
66:44 - image slider and well to make that
66:46 - happen let's go back to here
66:48 - react slick all right all right
66:52 - so okay so npm install reacts like dash
66:56 - dash let's go and copy that
66:58 - all right let's open up our terminal
67:00 - which we like to do by right-clicking
67:02 - and open an integrate terminal
67:03 - no problem right click on package.json
67:05 - or whatever you have to click right
67:06 - click on
67:07 - this opens up this okay so do npm
67:10 - install
67:11 - react.save done
67:14 - hit enter okay that will install the
67:16 - react slick module for you okay done
67:18 - that's all good we're not done yet
67:20 - though now we need to do npm install
67:22 - select carousel this will
67:23 - install us the css we need to use so
67:26 - next one is gonna be npm install
67:28 - let's look here so that's the next one
67:30 - and enter
67:33 - and look at this guys it literally has
67:36 - 746 000
67:38 - weekly downloads this tells me that this
67:40 - is a good module to download no
67:43 - good homage to not good module to
67:45 - download basically
67:46 - it's very well supported that's what
67:48 - that tells me okay
67:49 - okay now what we do is we need to now
67:52 - import the css files here
67:54 - okay and need to import of course import
67:57 - the actual
67:58 - uh the actual as well slider
68:01 - so let's do that so here we'll say
68:04 - import import
68:07 - slider from
68:11 - react dash slick dash slick
68:15 - all right save that right and then we'll
68:17 - do the following we'll save here
68:20 - we'll say let settings uh don't let's
68:24 - not do that just yet actually i'll do
68:26 - that just yet
68:27 - get that for a second here and then we
68:28 - need to import the css files right here
68:30 - imports like carousel
68:31 - right here so these ones are really
68:33 - really important so import
68:35 - and hopefully a month dave you can guys
68:36 - can take care of it maybe you guys can
68:37 - put in the chat something to put on a
68:38 - chat hopefully
68:39 - uh imports like yourself looks like that
68:41 - css right there that's the one that we
68:42 - need to use okay
68:44 - all right save that beautiful and we're
68:47 - not done yet so now at this point that's
68:49 - gonna
68:49 - use style components as well so let's go
68:51 - ahead and import style components
68:53 - of course they were currently here
68:57 - okay there so let's go ahead and do
69:00 - import style components
69:03 - import styled import styled
69:08 - styled from from what
69:12 - styled dash components
69:15 - done stylish components alright so
69:17 - that's
69:18 - that's good and instead of doing uh div
69:21 - we're gonna say carousel
69:23 - so command d just like both carousel
69:26 - done and let's create that style
69:28 - component we'll say const
69:30 - carousel is equal to what
69:34 - not style.div actually but
69:37 - check this out remember how we had to
69:38 - use slider remember how inside here
69:41 - we had to use slider component you see
69:44 - which came directly from here
69:46 - remember that well watch this
69:50 - instead you install the div i'm going to
69:52 - say styled
69:53 - slider basically instead of
69:57 - doing slider inside directly inside here
70:01 - i'm i'm giving it a style component
70:02 - because then i can actually style it
70:04 - myself
70:05 - right that's the whole reason why right
70:08 - that's the cool part about this so
70:11 - slider
70:11 - okay so that's there uh everything's
70:14 - gone everything's deleted
70:15 - that's okay don't worry there's a reason
70:17 - for it probably i know 100
70:20 - hopefully i think it's because the fact
70:22 - that we imported slider and we have not
70:24 - given
70:24 - any settings yet so don't worry about
70:26 - that so let's go ahead and create some
70:28 - settings
70:28 - we'll do let settings equals
70:32 - the following and there's a few things
70:34 - we can set there's like dots you know
70:36 - infinite true speed and so forth
70:38 - and first dots so that's the dots that
70:40 - will show up at the bottom so we'll say
70:42 - dots that's going to be true
70:44 - comma then we'll say infinite that's
70:47 - true basically you will infinitely
70:49 - should be able to infinite
70:52 - infinite that's going to be true as well
70:56 - all right then speed is gonna be 500
71:00 - that's 500 milliseconds
71:01 - that's basically half a second okay
71:03 - slice to show
71:05 - one to show
71:09 - ah my bad it's gonna be one
71:12 - comma and then we're going to do uh
71:15 - [Laughter]
71:18 - slice to scroll how many slices scroll
71:20 - per scroll basically slides
71:22 - to scroll is going to be
71:26 - one as well okay and auto uh
71:30 - auto play
71:33 - is going to be true
71:36 - boom so this is our settings okay i'll
71:39 - play is equal to true
71:40 - let's get the things down to here now
71:42 - the way we do that is using something
71:44 - this called destructuring you see how
71:45 - would they do it here
71:47 - it's called destructuring that's what
71:48 - that that's what that does so say
71:51 - dot dot dot settings basically it's put
71:54 - it puts in
71:55 - basically all of these all of these
71:58 - settings
71:59 - directly into the carousel div as a as a
72:01 - basically as
72:02 - a what's it called so save that
72:06 - why is my thing not working that's
72:09 - interesting
72:10 - right click it inspect element where is
72:11 - my header where's everything
72:13 - it's not it's not there at all the help
72:18 - carousel they're just going nuts on me
72:21 - let's go inspect down below here body
72:24 - the root oh there's something happening
72:27 - here it's very interesting
72:29 - something fail which i'm like oh oh
72:33 - slider occur in the div component
72:38 - element type is invalid expected string
72:41 - for built-in components of a class
72:42 - function react dom undefined but you
72:45 - likely forgot to export your component
72:46 - from the file is defined in or you might
72:48 - have mixed up
72:49 - default or name view okay imports
72:51 - interesting
72:52 - style import slider die right through
72:56 - rightly
72:58 - let me see slider import slider from
73:00 - carousel slick
73:02 - see import slider
73:06 - make sure it's all good guys and on
73:08 - youtube do you guys have the same and
73:10 - you guys are the same issue other just
73:12 - me
73:14 - maybe it's just me it's okay we'll be
73:17 - able to solve anything we put our mind
73:19 - to
73:20 - correct cons carousel that's fine
73:23 - that's so good we imported it correctly
73:26 - which is correct right
73:28 - um maybe it's because we need to have an
73:29 - actual div inside here let's try let's
73:31 - see this
73:32 - let me let me show this let me try this
73:33 - for a second here okay
73:40 - let me try this for a second here one
73:44 - second i'm going to do
73:44 - rap is a style.diff don't worry about it
73:46 - don't worry don't worry i got you guys
73:49 - so constraint
73:53 - is equal to style.div
73:58 - okay let's see okay so all right so the
74:00 - reason
74:01 - why it wasn't working looks like is
74:04 - all right so oh i know i know it's don't
74:06 - worry about it it's gonna get fixed okay
74:08 - so the reason why that's working because
74:09 - when we put it into the slider right
74:11 - there's really literally nothing here
74:13 - right there's nothing to slide and so it
74:15 - gives us errors right because it
74:17 - probably expects us to have some kind of
74:18 - a slider
74:19 - right it's some kind of uh the actual
74:21 - image inside here because if you look at
74:23 - here
74:24 - right we need to give it a div right a
74:26 - div
74:27 - to slide through so day of h1 or h3
74:29 - whatever might be
74:30 - right and so we're doing here is we're
74:32 - creating a d well to create a div what
74:33 - we're going to do is the following so
74:35 - let's go back to here
74:36 - right again it's going to be not going
74:38 - to work but
74:39 - we're going to create a wrap here a wrap
74:41 - div so that's gonna be
74:42 - it's just a normal div going to be a
74:43 - style component which we created inside
74:45 - here
74:46 - construct style.div okay
74:49 - and then inside here we're going to
74:51 - create an image that's the images we're
74:53 - going to
74:54 - uh now that's going to show up basically
74:56 - so do the following so we'll say image
74:57 - here
74:59 - say image and we'll say source is equal
75:02 - to the following
75:02 - okay there's going to be dash images
75:06 - images dash slider
75:12 - slider dash badging
75:16 - that jpeg there we go and
75:20 - close it out alright so good that's
75:23 - image one and then i'm going to get
75:25 - another image let's go ahead and do
75:26 - another image
75:28 - there we go now we have ourselves a
75:31 - slider
75:32 - right now it looks horrible i know it's
75:34 - like
75:35 - bad boom very bad right
75:39 - now would you agree with me that's bad
75:40 - right right raise your hand that's
75:41 - that's bad right
75:42 - that's pretty bad yeah i'll agree with
75:44 - that yeah you guys want to make it
75:44 - better shall we make it better
75:46 - yeah shall we make it better i think so
75:49 - i think so
75:50 - all right uh this pretty much just
75:53 - requires a a little bit of css that's
75:55 - that's pretty much all it does it all
75:57 - requires okay
75:58 - um so let's go ahead and actually look
75:59 - at our css here
76:01 - i'm gonna put this here uh boom right
76:03 - here
76:05 - hold that here
76:09 - all right so we're going to focus on the
76:11 - carousel here let's do a margin top here
76:12 - for a second so margin top
76:15 - so margin dash top is going to be 20
76:18 - pixels
76:20 - boom all right that's going to basically
76:22 - push a little bit oh they'll just go
76:24 - away what the hell
76:25 - i don't know what just happened so save
76:27 - that so it pushes the slider over to the
76:29 - bottom which that's what i like to do
76:31 - that's what i kind of like right so i
76:32 - kind of want to put a little bit more to
76:34 - the
76:34 - towards the bottom okay all right okay
76:37 - all right awesome sweet that's that all
76:40 - right and then what i want to do
76:41 - is well a few things
76:44 - um let's focus on the wrap here for a
76:46 - second here okay this wrap
76:48 - let's look on this image okay
76:52 - image let's focus on this image
76:56 - and with this image let's give the width
77:00 - width of a hundred percent
77:05 - and a height of a hundred percent
77:10 - okay boom right there see done
77:13 - so with a hundred percent higher and now
77:15 - it's a lot lot
77:16 - better would you agree with me that one
77:18 - i would say so
77:20 - um next up for this one let's change
77:22 - this one to not be slider badging let's
77:24 - change it to be slider
77:25 - b b a badagh
77:30 - but that that's actually inside the
77:31 - images folder but dag the jpeg
77:34 - all right so that means we have now two
77:35 - different images you see right there but
77:37 - dag
77:38 - but that's funny but doug
77:41 - that's funny all right on the image side
77:44 - um
77:44 - a few things i want to give it a little
77:46 - bit of a curvature here so let's do the
77:47 - following
77:48 - so a little bit of a curvature uh when i
77:50 - do the following so i'm going to say
77:52 - image and i'm going to say border radius
77:54 - okay
77:55 - border radius border radius
77:59 - radius or four pixels it's going to
78:02 - curve a little bit of that of that kind
78:04 - of like this image a little bit
78:06 - maybe you see it see right there maybe
78:07 - you see that right there see that
78:09 - you see how curves it a little bit i see
78:12 - that cursor just a little bit right
78:13 - there
78:14 - just right there okay okay and then i'm
78:17 - going to give it a box shadow now i want
78:19 - you guys to copy this one okay
78:20 - this box shadow check this out
78:24 - okay right there so rgb basically that's
78:26 - basically where the color is coming from
78:28 - to the color to where it's going so it's
78:29 - very simple right
78:30 - rgb right here maybe uh david armando
78:33 - maybe you guys can put in this box shout
78:34 - out for everybody in the comments below
78:36 - zero plus 26 plus so 30 30 pixels minus
78:38 - 10 pixels
78:39 - maybe yes you can put it's basically
78:40 - just a box shadow style
78:42 - that's all it is now i know it looks
78:46 - horrible right now
78:47 - it looks horrible now don't worry don't
78:49 - you worry at
78:51 - all okay so back shut up look at that oh
78:54 - that looks so good it looks so good
78:58 - all right i mean actually does not look
78:59 - good i'm sorry
79:01 - um does not look good at all actually so
79:05 - the reason why it does not look good at
79:06 - all because inside
79:08 - this right here this slick component
79:10 - it's called slick component we call it
79:12 - um we don't you see how in reality we're
79:16 - supposed to see
79:16 - all these other images you see that all
79:18 - these other images on the right hand
79:19 - side and the left-hand side you see that
79:20 - but we don't see that the reason being
79:23 - is because
79:24 - there's no overflow hidden on this div
79:28 - overflow biscuit on any overflow it
79:31 - hides the rest
79:32 - so to prevent that what we're going to
79:34 - do is the following so i'm going to say
79:36 - inside the carousel i'm going to target
79:39 - the slick list
79:41 - select dash list and here i'm going to
79:44 - say
79:45 - overflow visible
79:50 - boom holy that made a big
79:53 - difference you see
79:55 - just like that look see overflow visible
79:58 - to oral flow hidden right so before
80:01 - initially it was hidden
80:02 - by default that was inside their css
80:04 - that would they that they give you
80:06 - you see now it's visible
80:09 - visible visible
80:12 - done now it's visible okay
80:17 - right there so that's going to be that
80:19 - right there awesome sweet sweet sweet
80:20 - sweet sweet
80:21 - oh that looks so good okay
80:24 - that looks so good look at that oh
80:26 - that's so good guys how cool is that
80:28 - raise your hand with me if you're still
80:30 - with me yes
80:31 - yes yes everybody everybody
80:34 - everybody beautiful i like it
80:37 - it's looking so good we're making such
80:39 - good progress i love it
80:40 - all right so that's overflow visible and
80:42 - then what we're going to do
80:44 - is a few things i'm i need to change up
80:46 - to make it even better okay
80:48 - let's give a small border uh so let's go
80:50 - to border i'm going to say
80:51 - border 4 pixels here on this image i'm
80:53 - going to say border
80:55 - 4 pixels solid right
80:58 - transparent now what does that mean
81:01 - transparent is the color
81:03 - you see it adds a small like just
81:05 - transparent color
81:07 - now again right here it's kind of like
81:10 - right here and don't worry we'll fix it
81:11 - kind of how it looks like
81:12 - again it looks a little bit odd right
81:14 - here i know don't worry about it we'll
81:16 - fix that in a second here
81:17 - oh for example here so it's gonna be a
81:19 - transparent border right
81:21 - um next thing let's do the following
81:25 - here
81:25 - um on the carousel on the carousel
81:29 - so we have slick list then we're going
81:31 - to add a color white
81:33 - on all these active buttons right so
81:34 - let's do the following to do that
81:36 - i'm going to say li dot slick
81:40 - active so when there's an active button
81:43 - active button
81:46 - before right now how does this work out
81:48 - i will show you a little bit here
81:50 - for a second here and i'm going to say
81:52 - color white
81:56 - white okay
81:59 - ally slick that's actually inside let me
82:02 - see the carousel
82:03 - [Laughter]
82:07 - okay i'm also gonna do the following so
82:08 - i'm gonna say on every single button
82:10 - right here i'm gonna say ul ally
82:14 - button these are the basically the the
82:16 - next button
82:17 - right here and i'm gonna say like this
82:21 - before before
82:24 - i want to say here font size
82:30 - let's say font size i'm going to
82:31 - increase the fonts decrease fonts just a
82:33 - little bit so font says 10 pixels
82:35 - right there okay i'm gonna say give it a
82:37 - color this
82:38 - it gives i mean it can be cool it can be
82:40 - just a white color
82:42 - right there so these buttons right here
82:44 - see
82:47 - see boom all right so but i'm gonna give
82:49 - this a more gentle color i don't like
82:51 - that actually too much
82:56 - i like this color right here this guy's
82:58 - a little more gentler i kind of like
83:00 - that
83:00 - a little better a little better okay
83:04 - so that's kind of that color white uh
83:07 - same thing with
83:09 - right there oh you see how when it has
83:10 - like this white more of a
83:12 - more of a white look when on the active
83:14 - on the active button you see that right
83:15 - there
83:16 - see right there beautiful all right now
83:19 - you see how we have the next button
83:20 - but we don't have the previous button
83:22 - the reason by
83:23 - why is because of dz index so if i do
83:26 - button here
83:28 - and i give it a z index of one
83:31 - a one check this out
83:35 - oh let's go you see it right there
83:39 - that my friends is basically what we
83:41 - need right
83:42 - that's that's pretty much that let me go
83:44 - ahead and zoom in on this let me see how
83:46 - does this look like
83:47 - what do you guys think so far it's
83:49 - working pretty good
83:50 - i think so too i think so too i like it
83:53 - i like it i like it i like it
83:54 - i like it like that all right that's
83:57 - looking pretty good
83:58 - i like the way it's going oh my god not
84:00 - save this i don't want that
84:03 - that's pretty pretty good and then the
84:05 - next thing we need to do
84:06 - it to make it work a little bit better
84:09 - is
84:10 - is the following so so check this out um
84:13 - you see how here
84:15 - you see how this like this border is
84:16 - within this image see
84:18 - it's like a little bit better right
84:19 - that's kind of how i like it a lot
84:21 - better
84:21 - so what we'll do is this is called
84:24 - because of box sizing it's it's a little
84:25 - bit a little bit weird but i want you
84:27 - guys to understand this a little bit
84:28 - here
84:29 - it's all because of box setting border
84:31 - box so
84:33 - you see how these borders are on the
84:35 - outside here
84:37 - on the outside well to make them on the
84:40 - inside
84:41 - to make the basically included part of
84:42 - the whole image i'm going to go to
84:44 - app.css and i'm going to say
84:47 - everything that you have oops
84:50 - oops oops oops
84:53 - yeah box sizing board box save that boom
84:57 - see big difference look at that you see
84:59 - now what
85:00 - happens with this is basically it's
85:03 - telling for example
85:04 - uh border box when i say border box is
85:06 - saying hit the content
85:08 - should contain the border itself
85:10 - basically the width
85:11 - contains the border that's what that
85:13 - means right and so that's way
85:15 - when i say with 100 right the width
85:18 - actually is contained within the border
85:20 - that's what that means right that's how
85:21 - we can see the border which is much much
85:23 - better now and i like that a lot better
85:24 - honestly
85:26 - yeah oh let's go look at how good that
85:28 - looks guys
85:29 - that looks so so good oh my god it makes
85:32 - me happy
85:34 - all right let's go back to home.js let's
85:35 - go to image slider back to here
85:37 - we're not done yet we're almost done but
85:39 - not done yet almost there but we're not
85:41 - there
85:42 - we're so close but we're not there yet
85:44 - let's go all right
85:46 - uh next thing um
85:50 - i want to give it a small hover effect
85:52 - so what i mean by that on the hover of
85:54 - the image fully
85:56 - i want to change the sm a few small
85:57 - things i'm going to command b in here
86:00 - okay so i'm going to say hover
86:03 - i'm going to say hover hover
86:06 - and i'm gonna change the color the color
86:08 - of the board to be white so i'm gonna
86:09 - say border
86:11 - is gonna be four pixel solid
86:15 - solid but this time the border color
86:18 - is gonna be this one right here
86:21 - oh we see this rgba 249 so it's almost
86:23 - like a white color with a little bit of
86:25 - transparency
86:26 - and then save that
86:29 - let's see oh let's go look at that right
86:32 - there see
86:33 - okay next thing let's give a cursor
86:35 - point to the wrap
86:39 - cursor cursor pointer
86:42 - the wrap okay so when i hover it's like
86:46 - actually like a it's actually like a
86:47 - cursor right here you see
86:48 - it's good beautiful and then the last
86:50 - let's give it a transition so the
86:51 - transition duration should be
86:52 - transitioned let's give it extra
86:53 - transition
86:54 - so we'll say transition duration seconds
86:59 - oh look at that so

87:37 - questions let me have a question
87:39 - do you raise your hand if you think you
87:40 - want to you're tr you're wondering like

87:46 - this work
87:46 - okay good so look so because this is
87:50 - actually
87:51 - part of this is within the actual what's
87:54 - it called
87:54 - this is within um um i must say
87:57 - oh yeah we also need to fix this portion
87:59 - i want you to fix this don't worry we'll
88:01 - fix this
88:02 - i got it we'll play this in a second
88:04 - okay here
88:05 - so if i right click on this
88:09 - inspect element let me put this here a
88:12 - little bit to the bottom here
88:14 - okay i'm gonna put it here uh this is
88:16 - the button here you see button
88:17 - see this button so what's gonna happen
88:20 - we have this you see here look
88:22 - a line slick active so automatically
88:24 - basically javascript underneath the hood
88:26 - is adding a slick active class you see
88:28 - this to this li
88:30 - bone force is here then it goes to here
88:33 - and so we're doing here we're targeting
88:34 - a css call a class called called li
88:37 - slick active right there and then we're
88:40 - targeting the button now look at this
88:42 - see there's buttons you see this so
88:44 - button okay
88:46 - let me just let me let me do autoplay
88:48 - false for now so that stops here
88:52 - okay so it stops moving around right so
88:55 - you see here
88:56 - right there so button here so now this
89:00 - is a slack active here
89:01 - i'm gonna say button and look
89:04 - before you see so align slick active
89:08 - button before and then we've done it
89:11 - this actually is done through the slick
89:12 - carousel module right
89:14 - they do this themselves and look at that
89:16 - this before button has a color black
89:21 - what we did we said no make it color
89:23 - white
89:24 - that's what we do we overwrote overwrote
89:28 - the natural natural css that comes
89:31 - with react slick do you understand that
89:34 - raise your hand if you understand it
89:34 - with me
89:35 - yes do you see what i'm talking about do
89:37 - you see what i'm talking about
89:38 - yes we overwrote it but because by
89:41 - default
89:42 - by default the slick active if you go to
89:45 - slick active you go to that button then
89:46 - go to before
89:48 - see slick active button before by
89:50 - default it's just color black
89:53 - see here that's the default css that
89:55 - comes with the slick theme which is this
89:57 - one right here you see
89:58 - with this slick theme css but we said no
90:00 - no
90:01 - no no no no no no no no no no no no no
90:04 - no we're going to change ourselves
90:06 - that's what happened here so that's what
90:08 - we did here color white
90:09 - that's it all right and that's what
90:12 - happened now
90:13 - funny enough let's go ahead and fix this
90:14 - portion because that's pretty bad
90:16 - huh you guys want to fix that yeah if
90:18 - you because i'll fix that yeah i think
90:20 - so too
90:20 - all right well that's honestly that's
90:22 - not that bad to fix so what we need to
90:24 - do is we need to go to actually
90:25 - index.css
90:27 - uh i actually need to go to home.css
90:29 - home
90:30 - so home.js let's go home.js and all you
90:33 - need to do on the home.js is just say
90:35 - overflow hidden that's it
90:37 - so overflow here
90:40 - overflow inside the home.js overflow
90:44 - x is going to be hidden
90:47 - save it and
90:50 - so save that
90:53 - refresh is still there ah
90:57 - that's it and then also do the same
90:59 - thing on the header actually
91:00 - let's go to header actually so ahead of
91:02 - the gs same thing on the nav
91:04 - let's do overflow exiting overflow
91:09 - dash x dash hidden and what really this

94:38 - styled dash components
94:41 - components save that awesome
94:44 - okay and let's go ahead and create the
94:46 - container
94:52 - container and let's go and create the
94:55 - the container component so i'll say
94:56 - container here so const
94:58 - const container is equal to styled dot
95:01 - div
95:03 - the div done so
95:06 - done okay simple so
95:09 - all right now let's go ahead and do the
95:10 - following uh let's do
95:12 - this point let's give us a padding for
95:14 - us so the container let's do
95:16 - padding padding
95:20 - let's do some stuff let's do container
95:21 - padding 0 0
95:23 - 26 pixels and what is this actually on
95:26 - about what is this 26 pixels well if i
95:28 - go and take a look at this here
95:30 - let's go and say this right click
95:31 - viewers
95:36 - come on
95:41 - good okay so this one here
95:44 - right there so 26 pixels means literally
95:47 - heading bottom 26 pixels that's the
95:50 - shortcut for this one right
95:51 - pending bottom 26 pixels that's what
95:54 - that means okay
95:55 - all right now okay so that's all good
95:57 - that's so good now let's go ahead and
95:58 - take a look at it what are we going to
95:59 - put in here well
96:00 - this one is going to have a few things
96:02 - inside inside here actually no i need to
96:04 - be inside here ah
96:06 - container no actually it's not anybody
96:08 - my bad hold on
96:09 - that's not right hold on so this right
96:11 - here uh
96:12 - actually let's do margin top my bad
96:14 - margin dash top
96:16 - margin top and we'll say 30 pixels here
96:19 - hey that makes more sense right 30
96:21 - pixels that push it pushes it more to
96:23 - the bottom
96:24 - um let's do the following now let's do
96:29 - display grid so this would be really
96:31 - interesting now we're going to go into
96:32 - grid now
96:33 - now what is this grid raise your hand if
96:35 - you know what grid is anybody know what
96:36 - grid is
96:37 - what is grid or just yeah so what is
96:40 - grid
96:40 - so grid is basically it's kind of like
96:42 - flex but it allows us to be
96:44 - very discreet it's like a it's it's a
96:47 - it's basically like a
96:48 - uh you know flex and steroids that's
96:50 - what i'll call it
96:52 - you know that's what i'll call it and
96:55 - we'll give it a grid and we'll say here
96:58 - we'll say grid
97:02 - template columns so we'll have three so
97:04 - we have falcon with template
97:06 - template columns columns
97:10 - and with query template columns well
97:13 - actually
97:14 - then before we do that let me go ahead
97:15 - and comment this portion now just so i
97:16 - can show it to you
97:17 - inside the container of course we do we
97:19 - need to have all these images right so
97:21 - we need to create the wrap so
97:22 - i'm going to say create wrap wrap for
97:24 - this one
97:26 - wrap all right so my every single thing
97:28 - is going to be a wrap so this is going
97:30 - to be your app
97:30 - that's going to be a wrap it's going to
97:32 - be individual divs right here that's
97:33 - what these are okay
97:34 - understand comprende good right wrap
97:37 - and every single wrap is we'll have an
97:39 - image so the image
97:40 - image and we'll say source is equal to
97:44 - and it's going to be this one this is
97:45 - the image right here so hopefully maybe
97:47 - you guys see you guys know where to get
97:49 - it or maybe a month dave can help you
97:51 - guys out and actually give you guys the
97:52 - image okay
97:53 - so images viewers disney
97:56 - wrap is undefined don't worry we'll
97:58 - define it right now so it's like const
98:00 - const rap is equal to styled
98:03 - dot div
98:06 - boom style.if that's what it's equal to
98:10 - okay okay so style.div
98:14 - boom right there that's amazing okay and
98:17 - oh my god it looks so bad
98:19 - don't worry about it so let's go ahead
98:21 - and create a few of them okay so let's
98:23 - go ahead and do actually create five of
98:24 - them
98:25 - oh my god it looks so bad two three
98:28 - four five okay all righty
98:33 - let's go look at this it looks horrible
98:36 - i know it's okay don't worry about it so
98:39 - now to fix that
98:40 - that's where grizz is gonna come in so
98:42 - let's go try this out so it's grid and
98:44 - i'm going to give the columns now so
98:46 - look at this grid type of columns i'm
98:47 - going to say repeat
98:50 - so what this says create five columns so
98:53 - five comma min max
98:57 - and what this does is it gives it a
98:58 - width basically what is it we should use
99:00 - well minimum is zero basically but the
99:02 - one fr simply means
99:04 - stretch it out as much as possible
99:06 - basically that's what one frame
99:07 - stands for okay
99:11 - boom all right okay now it's kind of
99:13 - like in line
99:14 - but it still looks horrible uh and so
99:16 - that's where we need to actually go to
99:17 - the
99:18 - wrap and actually fix that right because
99:19 - technically we have five
99:22 - grids if you look at it right look see
99:25 - one see
99:26 - five grits one two three four five you
99:29 - see it's there it's just that
99:30 - disney the images are actually
99:32 - overflowing that's what's got what's
99:33 - going on right here
99:34 - so to fix that if we go to wrap and we
99:36 - say here
99:37 - image right i'm gonna say a width of a
99:40 - hundred percent
99:41 - so basically the image should take up a
99:43 - hundred percent a hundred percent
99:45 - done okay oh boom right there awesome
99:48 - sweet right
99:49 - so i'm then i'm going to saying i'm
99:51 - gonna i'm gonna say height over all
99:52 - those 100 say height 100
99:55 - boom right then i'm going to say object
99:58 - fit
99:59 - so object fit means hey fit up the
100:01 - object as much as possible so object fit
100:03 - cover so fitted the image as much as
100:06 - possible inside this div
100:08 - awesome and that's honestly pretty much
100:10 - it
100:11 - now for this wrap let's give it some
100:12 - stuff let's give this this
100:14 - so we'll say here uh border let's give
100:16 - it a border
100:17 - and the border will be look like a
100:19 - little bit like this kind of it's a very
100:20 - light border
100:22 - look three pixel solid
100:25 - rgba that's the rgb i want you guys to
100:26 - use right 249 249 and 0.1 so
100:29 - it's a very light border let's go and
100:30 - save that okay
100:32 - border is not showing up let's see
100:37 - not showing up which is completely okay
100:41 - border oh i didn't real right here
100:43 - border
100:45 - see border zero pixels oh solid solid
100:49 - right there awesome so that looks great
100:51 - so we have one
100:52 - two three four five things that we have
100:56 - okay now of course let's add some border
100:57 - radius to this one let's say border
100:58 - radius
101:00 - border dash radius radius and let's give
101:03 - it a 10 pixel radius
101:06 - nice oh it looks so much better now now
101:08 - it still looks pretty bad i don't like
101:10 - it
101:10 - did you guys agree that this would you
101:12 - guys agree that it needs some spacing in
101:14 - between like in between every single
101:16 - column would you
101:17 - would you guys agree with me on that one
101:19 - should we add some spacing yeah
101:20 - beautiful all right beautiful so to do
101:23 - that we're going to use a gap
101:25 - we're going to use something called gap
101:26 - so check this out
101:28 - okay let's use grid gap grid
101:32 - dash gap and i will say 25 pixels
101:37 - boom oh look at that
101:41 - so grid gap is a very useful tool
101:44 - okay it's a very useful way to add a gap
101:47 - between every single grid item
101:51 - boom see so simple so simple right
101:54 - and now let's go ahead maybe add some uh
101:58 - let's get add some padding inside this
102:00 - container so say padding
102:02 - let's say 30 pixels zero
102:07 - and we'll say 26 pixels
102:11 - boom so push it over the bottom so
102:12 - basically if you inspect them but on
102:14 - this one
102:15 - if i go ahead and go look at this
102:16 - specific padding you see
102:18 - this literally just means it's very
102:20 - simple padding top is 30 pixels putting
102:22 - right is zero
102:24 - putting left is zero and then pending
102:25 - bottom is 26. this is this means
102:27 - top this is bottom this right here
102:29 - stands for left and right
102:31 - that's what that means okay all right
102:33 - beautiful
102:34 - all right so that's that now let's go
102:37 - ahead and
102:37 - give it a box shadow okay
102:40 - i'm gonna get a box shot it looks a
102:42 - little bit kind of like this
102:44 - right there so again you can copy this
102:47 - as well hopefully maybe
102:48 - uh david and my mother can put it for
102:50 - you guys in the comments or maybe he'll
102:52 - put you guys in the comments in there
102:54 - just a box show just kind of copy it for
102:56 - yourself here
102:57 - all right so that's that so gives it you
102:59 - see that gives it that box which is
103:00 - really good by the way which looks so
103:02 - good which i
103:02 - like a lot actually it's a very light
103:04 - back shadow okay
103:06 - and then let's do a hover effect so on
103:08 - the hover i actually want to make it
103:09 - bigger so
103:10 - let's do on the hover now by the way
103:15 - do you know what this does what does
103:17 - this do do anybody
103:18 - raise your hand you know what this does
103:20 - raise your hand if you don't know what
103:21 - this does so
103:24 - this actually basically concatenates the
103:26 - hover
103:27 - to the parent which is the wrap it's
103:30 - kind of like doing it's kind of like
103:31 - doing for example
103:33 - wrap wrap hover that's what it's doing
103:37 - so basically this is concatenating hover
103:40 - to the wrap that's what it's doing just
103:42 - so you guys know okay
103:44 - all right on the hover let's go ahead
103:46 - and change up the
103:48 - particular let's do scale it so it's
103:50 - going to scale it in
103:51 - x and y direction so transform skill so
103:54 - scale just simply means make it bigger
103:56 - okay and then we'll change the border
103:58 - color to be a little more different as
103:59 - well
104:01 - yes boom okay so now if i say this
104:05 - boom you see it's a little bit different
104:06 - now but of course we can make it better
104:08 - let's add a cursor point this one
104:12 - cursor pointer pointer
104:15 - save that okay now now to cursor pointer
104:18 - which i like a lot awesome sweet
104:20 - god it looks so good guys it looks so
104:22 - awesome i love it
104:24 - all right that's cursor pointer and then
104:26 - what i want to do is i want to go ahead
104:27 - and change up the box shadow here
104:30 - as well just a little bit
104:35 - let's do box shadow change the box just
104:38 - a little bit here not
104:39 - not not too much so it becomes a big
104:42 - becomes a bigger box shadow
104:43 - but to make this actually cleaner we're
104:45 - going to give it a transition
104:49 - boom so this is truly biscuit transition
104:51 - everything with
104:53 - by the way this number remember this
104:55 - number i want you guys to remember this
104:57 - this is a big number here this number is
104:59 - actually used in a lot of transitions
105:01 - this is if you if you give it to if you
105:03 - give it a number higher than this
105:05 - it became becomes too slow if you get a
105:07 - number
105:08 - less than this it becomes sometimes too
105:10 - fast so actually this number is actually
105:12 - used by a lot of developers this number
105:14 - 250 milliseconds so just keep this one
105:16 - in mind okay
105:18 - and this is the transition we want to
105:19 - use right here cubic desire
105:22 - desire all right save that and look now
105:24 - look at this you guys ready for this you
105:26 - guys ready
105:27 - are we ready hold on oh
105:30 - oh my god that looks so good oh oh
105:34 - so good oh this looks so good
105:38 - oh that looks great that looks amazing i
105:42 - love this one
105:43 - i love that one the border changes
105:46 - transformation oh it looks so
105:48 - good
105:52 - how cool is that huh so that's pretty
105:54 - much that for you
105:55 - so look we finished the viewers but of
105:57 - course let's go ahead and change up
105:58 - these images so they're a little bit

109:15 - we'd like to do which is import style so
109:17 - i'm going to use style components of
109:18 - course
109:19 - import style from where import styled
109:21 - from
109:23 - from style dash components
109:27 - stylish components components okay
109:30 - and then instead of doing return data
109:32 - we'll do containers so we'll say
109:35 - container let's go all right
109:38 - at the bottom we have cons container so
109:41 - let's do the following
109:42 - const container is equal to what styled
109:47 - dot dip
109:53 - okay okay so that's good all right
109:56 - nothing too crazy here
109:58 - uh let's get a little bit of padding
109:59 - here and this penny what do you guys
110:00 - think this this pen is gonna be bottom
110:02 - padding so don't worry about so much
110:03 - about that one right all right
110:04 - uh next one is let's do h4 so we'll do
110:07 - an h4 here
110:09 - h4 let's do so this is going to be a had
110:11 - a
110:12 - h4 heading uh let's do here recommend
110:16 - recommended for you
110:23 - oh no that's not what i want save that
110:26 - oh let's go that's beautiful it looks
110:28 - great that looks great i like that
110:30 - i like it like that
110:34 - i like it okay beautiful i like it
110:37 - it's a little bit big i feel like no i
110:38 - feel like it's a little bit bigger than
110:39 - what i like it
110:40 - or like it to be but it's okay we'll fix
110:42 - that later don't worry about that
110:43 - recommended recommended by for
110:46 - you that's okay so next up let's go
110:49 - ahead
110:50 - um and create our content so as you know
110:53 - right our content is actually going to
110:55 - be here that this is our content right
110:57 - that's our content and that's going to
110:59 - contain the movie so to do that what
111:01 - we'll do is create a content component
111:03 - so look at a content component right and
111:06 - the reason why we're doing this because
111:07 - it's going to make us to it's going to
111:08 - allow us to easily use a grid for
111:10 - example
111:11 - to wrap up our uh you know wrap up our
111:14 - list of
111:14 - stuff right so list of movies all right
111:17 - um
111:18 - okay let's go ahead and create create a
111:19 - content component say const
111:21 - content is equal to style.div
111:25 - boom style.div
111:28 - okay save that save that's good
111:33 - all right save that
111:37 - okay and it's all good right there
111:41 - beautiful so content
111:42 - styled dot this that is pretty pretty
111:46 - awesome okay
111:47 - so let's do the following so now we'll
111:48 - do uh let's create for that content now
111:51 - every single movie just like how it was
111:53 - here is going to be a div as well
111:55 - see how this right here so every single
111:56 - movie here is also going to be a div
111:59 - and we're going to call it a wrap so
112:01 - let's do that
112:02 - here we'll say wrap
112:05 - wrap wrap okay i will say here
112:09 - image source is equal to something
112:13 - well our image is going to be the
112:14 - following maybe hopefully maybe
112:16 - hopefully
112:17 - um maybe hopefully
112:21 - uh we can go ahead and comment this
112:23 - portion out for you guys
112:24 - or but this is going to be a temporary
112:26 - image that i'm going to use it's the
112:28 - is this image right here you see now
112:31 - maybe a month later you guys can put it
112:32 - into the chat right here
112:34 - uh or put it into the the youtube
112:36 - comments as well
112:38 - and nothing nothing too much of a crazy
112:39 - solution situation but
112:41 - wraps undefined let's create a wrap
112:42 - right here
112:44 - constant wrap is equal to
112:47 - style div boom
112:52 - all right save it all right this is the
112:53 - image we're going to use the simpsons
112:55 - image for now now you can get it pretty
112:57 - much any anywhere you want
112:58 - right just go ahead and for example uh
113:01 - you know i'll copy image address and
113:02 - i can put it to you guys in the chat i'm
113:04 - a cop yeah i could do that here for
113:05 - example
113:06 - i can put you guys in the chat maybe for
113:09 - [Music]
113:10 - example
113:13 - let me see
113:16 - let me put you guys in the chat so you
113:17 - guys can all have it let me see
113:21 - boom that's the image we're going to use
113:26 - there we go the same as we're going to
113:27 - use awesome sweet sweet sweet
113:29 - and then maybe a month you can place
113:32 - that into the actual chat
113:33 - on youtube that'll be amazing actually
113:35 - if you can do that that'll be
113:36 - very very helpful for so many people all
113:38 - right so if we have this
113:40 - let's do the same thing now but let's do
113:42 - multiple like multiple times let's do it
113:44 - like
113:45 - for example how many times we need well
113:47 - we need to be one two three four so four
113:48 - times actually so four times so we'll do
113:50 - the same thing we'll do four
113:52 - one two three four save that okay you
113:55 - can see right now it's horrible
113:56 - of course it makes sense right why it's
113:58 - horrible it's from left to right
114:00 - well to fix that again we're going to
114:02 - use grid to fix that
114:03 - right again let's do that so we're going
114:05 - to go on the content side
114:07 - i'm going to say display display grid
114:12 - grid okay i will say grid
114:16 - gap okay was to be 25 pixels
114:20 - okay 20 pixels and then here we'll say
114:24 - grid template columns so just how we've
114:26 - done definite calls before we'll say the
114:28 - same thing here so grid
114:29 - dash template dash columns
114:33 - okay and we'll say repeat
114:37 - 4 comma min
114:40 - max right there 0
114:44 - comma 1 fr right so again same thing but
114:47 - just by repeating it four times
114:49 - boom look at that so so fast we've got
114:52 - our thing finished that's all great okay
114:54 - so that's amazing awesome all right so
114:58 - that's so good
114:58 - so now of course now we have the four
115:00 - cons which is um which is exactly what
115:02 - we want but just now we need to fix the
115:04 - actual images themselves that's not an
115:05 - issue whatsoever
115:06 - so that means we need to go to wrap here
115:09 - and now on the image side just how we
115:12 - did it beforehand
115:13 - let's give it a width of 100 percent
115:17 - 100 that means it will fill up the full
115:21 - grid see what there see just like that
115:23 - it's fixed
115:24 - height of 100 100
115:28 - there okay that stretches the image a
115:31 - little bit so
115:32 - to fix that we do object fit
115:36 - object dash fit dash phase can be
115:40 - covered
115:42 - boom see it just object fitness kit will
115:45 - cover up the image within
115:47 - a div okay so we'll it will stretch out
115:50 - as much as possible without
115:51 - while keeping the aspect ratio of the
115:53 - actual image okay beautiful
115:55 - so we got that next thing let's go ahead
115:57 - and focus on the wrap
115:59 - let's give it a border radius because i
116:00 - kind of want that so border radius
116:03 - is also going to be 10 pixels all right
116:07 - that's that's great that's amazing
116:08 - so i like that that's 10 pixels and then
116:11 - you can see now
116:12 - i know that i know technically if we
116:14 - save this doesn't show 10 pixels don't
116:15 - worry about that we'll
116:16 - make it show there's a second if i do
116:18 - overflow hidden
116:20 - hidden then it will show it the border
116:22 - radius
116:24 - boom you see you see what happens again
116:25 - because the image just goes outside the
116:28 - border
116:28 - right and so when we do overflow hidden
116:30 - well then it's it can contain
116:32 - inside the actual div beautiful all
116:34 - right
116:35 - next thing let's go ahead and do it
116:36 - let's give it a uh a border
116:39 - the bottom one uses this one so border
116:43 - three pixels solid rgba with this one
116:46 - right here
116:47 - right so feel free to copy this one
116:49 - maybe or maybe a month or david maybe
116:51 - you guys can go ahead and copy this one
116:52 - into into somebody some
116:53 - somewhere all right next up box shadow
116:58 - that's this one boom so again feel free
117:01 - to copy this
117:02 - box shadow in here feel free to copy
117:05 - this
117:05 - to anywhere you want it to be okay
117:08 - hopefully you guys can see that all
117:12 - right
117:12 - so that's box shadow and honestly that's
117:15 - that's
117:16 - pretty pretty pretty much it that's
117:18 - nothing more crazy than that that's
117:20 - it looks pretty pretty damn good won't
117:21 - you guys say so i would say so
117:25 - i kind of like that actually it's pretty
117:27 - pretty good i like that a lot actually
117:29 - all right so now at this point let's do
117:32 - the following here
117:33 - okay i'll do the following here so we
117:35 - have the box shadow we have the border
117:37 - we have all
117:38 - that that's amazing that's awesome let
117:40 - me go ahead and
117:41 - wait wait wait wait wait wait what is
117:43 - this no that's good
117:45 - that's good that's good that's good okay
117:48 - next thing let's do
117:49 - let's do a hover effect so on the hover
117:51 - again we're going to use this
117:52 - hover effect right here on the hover of
117:54 - this right
117:55 - boom right let's scale it a little bit a
117:58 - little bit just how we did it before
117:59 - previously
118:01 - transform scale okay save that
118:05 - boom and then let's do let's change the
118:08 - border color
118:08 - of on this so on the hover of this
118:12 - all we do is we change the border color
118:13 - to be this so basically
118:15 - it's a similar border color but it's a
118:16 - little more visible see it's a white
118:18 - white color
118:19 - that's what's going to happen here so
118:20 - it's a white color that's a little more
118:22 - visible that's what's going to happen
118:23 - okay okay then we're going to change the
118:27 - box shadow to be a little bit more
118:28 - prevalent as well
118:31 - all right actually a bit more a little
118:35 - more prevalent let's do that
118:38 - let's go that's amazing i like that
118:41 - i like that and now see now
118:47 - right there that's exactly what we want
118:51 - but of course um we don't see you way
118:53 - too much because we need to do a
118:54 - transition so to do a transition we're
118:56 - going to see you use
118:57 - the same transition we used before
118:59 - transition
119:00 - all 250 milliseconds cubic
119:03 - desire desire it's funny desire so feel
119:06 - free to copy this for yourself right
119:08 - here
119:08 - transition all 250 milliseconds cubic
119:11 - desire 0.25 0.46 2.4
119:13 - 4.45 0.94
119:16 - zero seconds right there okay save that
119:21 - save that oh look at that and let's do a
119:24 - cursor pointer
119:27 - cursor pointer to actually do that it's
119:31 - a cursor pointer
119:37 - look at that how cool is that huh
119:43 - that's pretty slick guys okay
119:47 - okay that's pretty pretty slick okay i
119:50 - love that that looks so
119:51 - good that looks so good guys all right
119:55 - looks so good look at that the box shot
119:57 - look at the transition it's so great
119:59 - i love that all right all right
120:02 - so who's still with me guys you guys
120:04 - still with me yes or no
120:05 - yes yes beautiful i love seeing all your
120:09 - beautiful faces
120:10 - that makes me so so happy all right
120:14 - so we got that portion let's go ahead
120:15 - and look at this if i go ahead and copy
120:17 - this portion
120:18 - this whole thing and i paste it multiple
120:20 - times
120:22 - basically i just create more simpsons
120:25 - so i create more movies that's that's
120:26 - all i'm doing so that is
120:28 - what our goal was it was to create
120:30 - actually just simply just create this
120:31 - all right
120:33 - and uh well the home page i will
120:36 - honestly say
120:37 - is um kaput
120:40 - finite i mean in terms of design of
120:42 - course the logic not so much there yet
120:44 - but your design it's kaput it's done
120:47 - right so
120:48 - what i want to focus on so that's
120:49 - awesome so we have that
120:51 - and of course these images are actually
120:53 - going to be replaced that are on by
120:54 - images that would come from a database
120:56 - so that's we're going to
120:57 - we're going to do that later on a little
120:58 - bit but i want to work on the detail
121:00 - page now so let's go and work on the
121:02 - detail page now okay
121:04 - so detail page so i will save this and
121:08 - let's work on the detail page now
121:09 - the detail page is basically going to be
121:11 - another component so let's go ahead and
121:13 - do here new file here and we'll do
121:17 - detail dot js okay
121:20 - gs so that's going to be the detail
121:22 - detail one that we use so let's go ahead
121:24 - and do this so the rfce
121:26 - rfce beautiful create the detail
121:29 - component inside here which is exactly
121:31 - what we need
121:32 - and this will be detail all right sweet
121:35 - all right
121:36 - now how do we go and switch up between
121:38 - detail page and
121:39 - the home page good question um well it's
121:42 - going to be very very simple
121:44 - uh we're going to use something called
121:45 - react router dom so what we need to do
121:47 - is need to go to app.js
121:49 - and you see how we have the header home
121:51 - so by default it's just simply just
121:53 - throwing the header and the home
121:54 - well we need to change that to be to
121:56 - change to use something called react
121:58 - water down so i'm going to go to
121:59 - if i go to react router dom
122:02 - here okay
122:06 - right right here you see that's what we
122:08 - need to use so this is what we need to
122:10 - do is react
122:11 - router down so we need to inspe install
122:14 - install
122:15 - react router dom again let's right click
122:18 - it
122:18 - open and integrate terminal right
122:21 - mp install react power down beautiful
122:28 - nice nice nice nice nice i like it i
122:30 - like it i like it that's awesome
122:32 - okay all right let me show this
122:38 - wow i'm really hungry
122:42 - it's a lot you know cool um
122:47 - i might stretch if you have to oh yeah
122:50 - that was good
122:51 - yeah whoa that's what i'm talking about
122:54 - go left yep
123:03 - beautiful okay all right
123:06 - so that's good
123:09 - so we installed
123:12 - react router dom now to actually use it
123:17 - to use it as you can see we need to go
123:20 - ahead and actually
123:21 - import it like so so browser router and
123:24 - so forth so let's go ahead and import
123:25 - that
123:26 - so import and you guys can do that on
123:29 - yourself here
123:30 - right there so you need to import
123:34 - right here browser router switch
123:38 - route and link now the way this works is
123:40 - very simple
123:41 - and i'll show it to you here in a second
123:42 - how this works but
123:44 - regretter is pretty much going to wrap
123:48 - your whole application
123:49 - around a route right a router and so if
123:53 - we go ahead and we
123:54 - got the router hold on
123:59 - right here i'm gonna do this
124:03 - router so the whole package is gonna be
124:05 - right around the router
124:06 - okay by default every single route will
124:09 - have a header page correct yes correct
124:12 - right so by default everything will have
124:14 - the header page right
124:16 - then what's going to happen is
124:20 - then we'll have multiple routes where
124:23 - either the home page or the detail page
124:25 - changes you can see for example if i
124:26 - click on the detailed page here right
124:28 - the header does not change but what does
124:31 - change
124:32 - is this portion right that changes right
124:35 - so that's what we will achieve with this
124:38 - if i go ahead and if i click on this i'm
124:41 - going to say here now i'm going to say
124:42 - switch
124:43 - switch so again that's coming from
124:46 - directly from here you see that switch
124:48 - switch switch and switch just means
124:53 - hey turn on this switch this to it this
124:54 - switch or this switch that's all it
124:56 - means
124:57 - and then we will go ahead and do route
125:00 - so route if we see there's a the path
125:05 - is detail
125:08 - detail
125:11 - if the path is detailed we will use the
125:14 - detail page so let's go ahead and do
125:16 - that i'm going to say
125:17 - import detail component
125:21 - from where components
125:24 - right components slash what
125:28 - detail boom voila
125:31 - right next up so then we do
125:35 - detail like so
125:38 - detail so that will be on the route
125:40 - where the path is
125:42 - slash detail we'll give it a detail page
125:46 - however
125:46 - if the route is a home page for example
125:50 - like this
125:51 - or the path is actually just just home
125:54 - right there right then it will have the
125:57 - home one
125:59 - the home component is trying to see how
126:03 - this works
126:04 - it's very simple right very simple
126:08 - we have a router that's this right
126:10 - anything that's inside the router will
126:12 - always be visible
126:14 - right so for example the header here
126:15 - will always be visible
126:17 - anything inside the switch case will
126:19 - always change
126:20 - so for example if i have a route here
126:23 - with the path details a path is
126:24 - basically the url path that's this path
126:26 - okay if it's detail we go to detail page
126:30 - if it's home page path is slash it's the
126:33 - home page
126:34 - raise your hand that makes sense does
126:35 - that make sense yes or no comprende
126:37 - yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
126:39 - beautiful right
126:40 - that's going to be the home page and now
126:43 - let's go and take a look at that
126:45 - all right so if i save this now
126:48 - technically i'm in the homepage you see
126:51 - nothing really changed
126:52 - but if i go to slash detail
126:57 - boom we are on the detail component
127:01 - you see the header still stays which is
127:03 - right here
127:04 - which is exactly what we want to do
127:06 - right but the detail component which is
127:08 - this one
127:09 - says detail how sick is that
127:13 - what do you guys think you guys like
127:14 - that i think it's pretty cool
127:17 - all right so that's pretty cool so on
127:19 - the detail brush now let's go ahead and
127:20 - focus on the detail
127:21 - page inside here well the detail page is
127:24 - a little bit longer
127:26 - than some other pages so here's what
127:27 - we'll do let's go ahead and do import
127:30 - import styled from style components
127:36 - style dash components okay
127:40 - so import style from style dash
127:43 - components okay
127:44 - and a few things are gonna happen here
127:46 - in the detail page of course
127:47 - let's go and make this a container as we
127:49 - like to do all the time
127:52 - papa so we'll say
127:56 - container container just like so
128:03 - all right beautiful uh not defined
128:05 - that's not a problem whatsoever so we
128:07 - say now const
128:08 - the form will do the following so const
128:10 - container
128:13 - is equal to what oh is equal to
128:17 - style.div right there okay style the div
128:23 - okay and this dollar this is going to be
128:26 - pretty pretty simple
128:27 - uh same thing we're going to give it a
128:29 - min height just how you did it for home
128:31 - so min height
128:33 - i mean height height
128:37 - i mean height height is going to be calc
128:40 - a hundred vertical height vertical
128:42 - height 100 vh
128:44 - minus 70 pixels step 70 pixels basically
128:46 - that's the
128:47 - that's that top bar right there okay
128:51 - awesome and then we could also padding
128:53 - just how did
128:54 - we give a padding to the home page too
128:56 - so padding which is this one
128:57 - so zero calc three point five rev
129:01 - no vw basically means
129:04 - um width so basically that's the
129:07 - viewport width so 3.5 viewport width
129:10 - right there ah right there beautiful see
129:13 - nice
129:14 - all right so that's all good now of
129:16 - course
129:17 - if you think about this what does this
129:19 - have let's think about
129:20 - what does this specific thing have well
129:23 - it has a few things
129:25 - in terms of components well we have this
129:27 - this is the main component correct
129:29 - but this component is actually has a
129:30 - background you see it has a background
129:31 - image right so we can call the
129:33 - background image
129:34 - and then we have this kind of like logo
129:36 - and then
129:37 - we have i like to think of it as like a
129:39 - row so right see
129:40 - you see i always think of i see things
129:42 - as rows and columns
129:44 - this to me is a row that contains
129:46 - multiple columns
129:47 - column one button another button third
129:50 - button
129:51 - and fourth button right then we have
129:54 - another row
129:55 - that has this then another row that has
129:58 - the description basically of the thing
130:01 - do you understand that yes or no
130:02 - right yes so good yes yes yes yes yes
130:04 - bona good
130:06 - awesome sweet so that's what that has
130:08 - okay all right now and we can simply
130:10 - just
130:11 - honestly basically look at what we just
130:13 - have you see we can do it so the first
130:15 - we need to create is the background
130:17 - is the background component so let's
130:18 - create the background component so we'll
130:20 - say background
130:22 - background
130:25 - boom background component and we'll give
130:28 - the image
130:29 - source is equal to the following right
130:32 - and maybe if
130:33 - amount of the americans can help me out
130:35 - and actually give them this image source
130:38 - and this image stores again you can use
130:40 - any image source you want
130:42 - but in my in my case i have this one
130:44 - which maybe i can give it to you guys in
130:46 - chat
130:47 - here i'll go take this in chat
130:52 - boom that's the image i use okay that's
130:54 - the image i used
130:56 - that's just basically just this image
130:57 - right here all right
131:00 - okay that's the image and then so that's
131:03 - going to be the component if i go ahead
131:04 - and save that okay we have an error says
131:06 - background is not defined so say
131:08 - const const background
131:13 - is equal to styled dot div
131:18 - style that div the phone style div
131:21 - beautiful
131:23 - okay oh let's go
131:26 - look at that i mean it looks horrible
131:27 - but it's still it's kind of there
131:29 - right now just how we did our background
131:33 - image we're going to position it also
131:35 - fixed to the whole page so as
131:37 - we'll do the position fixed
131:40 - position fixed you see
131:44 - boom change right here we'll say top 0
131:49 - top 0 right we'll say left zero
131:53 - just how i like to do it left zero
131:55 - bottom zero
131:57 - right and then what right zero
132:01 - right zero okay okay
132:05 - boom right there right zero okay now
132:06 - again it looks a little bit odd here i
132:08 - can see that right right zero don't
132:09 - worry about that we'll make it work
132:10 - don't worry
132:11 - and then here's what we'll do in that
132:12 - case right so and then position fixed
132:14 - about position effects to what well
132:16 - position the fix to the actual container
132:17 - so we'll say here position
132:19 - relative remember if you're doing
132:21 - position absolute position
132:23 - fixed you have to use position relative
132:25 - because it will fix it
132:27 - to the relative parent kind of like you
132:29 - have to have a parent kind of like
132:30 - you know you will have a parent right so
132:33 - position
132:35 - relative save that
132:38 - right nothing really changes here and in
132:41 - those terms but what does change is the
132:42 - following look at this
132:43 - i'm going to now target the image itself
132:47 - image right and then i'm going to say
132:50 - here
132:51 - the image here is width 100
132:56 - with 100 good and height
132:59 - of what of 100 as well
133:03 - okay i know it got stretched out but
133:05 - don't worry because what we can do is we
133:06 - can say object fit
133:10 - object dash fit is going to be what
133:13 - cover i want you guys to look into that
133:16 - cover
133:17 - boom see oh moly mole
133:21 - now you can see it just covered the
133:22 - whole thing right which is don't worry
133:23 - about that
133:24 - you know um so to prevent that from
133:28 - covering the whole thing
133:28 - it's very it's as simple as well i just
133:31 - put a z index minus one on it so that's
133:32 - it look
133:34 - z index minus one
133:37 - and now the header shows as well
133:40 - and yeah that's it's as simple as that
133:43 - nothing too crazy you have to you have
133:44 - to honestly do
133:45 - let's add some more pat let's add a
133:47 - small opacity to some say opacity
133:50 - passes 0.8
133:53 - so it's a little bit darker you see that
133:55 - a little bit darker and honestly
133:57 - that is our background image that is
133:59 - done comprende yes all good
134:01 - beautiful awesome sweet all right so i
134:04 - like that
134:05 - let's now go back to our what go back to
134:09 - our top
134:10 - and let's think about what else do we
134:11 - have well we also have this thing which
134:13 - is this
134:14 - which i like to call a title so so
134:16 - basically that's done
134:17 - now let's call let's you let's focus on
134:20 - this one
134:21 - right focusing down so that's going to
134:23 - be the title okay
134:25 - and we'll call it image title
134:32 - title boom and we'll also give an image
134:37 - image source and i also have that source
134:39 - for now again
134:40 - this data will come later on from a
134:42 - database so don't worry about that
134:44 - okay i'm going to copy this image so you
134:46 - guys can all have it and i'll paste in
134:48 - the chat as well
134:49 - maybe i might dip a monopoly if you can
134:51 - paste it in the comments on youtube as
134:52 - well that'd be awesome thank you
134:56 - okay i'm gonna paste it here
135:00 - boom okay all right so that's gonna be
135:03 - that
135:03 - all right let's go to our application
135:05 - here so this image is not defined of
135:07 - course we define it in using
135:08 - style.div nothing crazy here let's do
135:12 - following
135:13 - and we say what image title and
135:17 - define it first
135:21 - so we say const image title
135:26 - is equal to styled dot div
135:30 - done oh let's go that looks like
135:35 - i mean not that much but it's not bad
135:38 - again
135:38 - we can also use some really really cool
135:40 - things with that right so in the image
135:42 - title here
135:43 - we're going to give it a height height
135:47 - of 30vh vertical height
135:51 - okay all right and don't worry about it
135:53 - we'll fix it on the image
135:54 - and then we'll we'll give the image so
135:56 - here's here's the thing
135:58 - with images give it a parent container
136:01 - and then on the image say with hundred
136:03 - percent hide 100 and do object fit
136:06 - that is your recipe for any good image
136:09 - sizing
136:10 - give a parent container right a
136:12 - container to contain
136:14 - once you've done that on the image say
136:16 - with a hundred percent hide a hundred
136:18 - percent
136:19 - and then give it an object fit that is
136:21 - your
136:22 - your go-to that should be your goal too
136:23 - okay so do image
136:26 - same thing with a hundred percent
136:30 - okay a height of a hundred percent
136:35 - look at this object fake this time the
136:37 - however contained
136:40 - right boom
136:44 - big difference huh much big difference
136:46 - much big difference right
136:48 - don't worry we'll make it better even
136:50 - right now so as we'll do i'll do
136:52 - uh width of this one is going to be
136:55 - 35 pw
136:59 - viewport width right there see that
137:01 - makes it even better and then we give it
137:03 - a minute let's go ahead and give it a
137:04 - min height
137:06 - just in case main height
137:12 - mean height of 170 pixels
137:17 - beautiful and then we'll do a mini width
137:19 - of 200 pixels
137:25 - manual width of 200 pixels
137:30 - all right so nothing created it just
137:32 - does change but all we know is that this
137:34 - is working this image is great right so
137:35 - that's uh
137:36 - we're getting very close to where we
137:37 - want to get to all right next up
137:40 - what we need to do is next up is we need
137:42 - to go ahead and focus on what
137:43 - that's going to be kind of like this
137:45 - content right here
137:47 - all this content right here i want to
137:48 - focus now on the controls
137:51 - you see this on the controls so let's go
137:53 - ahead and focus
137:54 - on the controls here so i want to say
137:57 - the following
137:58 - i'm going to say here
138:01 - controls let's go and do ah controls
138:04 - right here
138:05 - i'm going to create the controls con so
138:07 - controls oh
138:08 - controls controls container
138:12 - boom controls and all that will simply
138:15 - do is very simple
138:16 - let's go ahead and that will contain the
138:18 - play button and stuff like that right so
138:19 - let's go ahead and
138:20 - start the div
138:24 - so guns controls
138:27 - const controls is equal to
138:31 - styled.div
138:34 - okay inside here it's very simple we
138:37 - have four buttons here
138:38 - one two three four okay one two three
138:40 - four oh no
138:43 - on that side it's very simple now at
138:45 - this point we need to create
138:46 - four four buttons one's gonna be the
138:48 - play button so let me hear
138:50 - the play button
138:53 - okay god gosh darn it then we do the
138:56 - trailer button
138:59 - trailer button okay and then we have the
139:02 - add button
139:05 - let's go ahead and add that one too add
139:08 - bhutan beautiful and then we have the
139:12 - group
139:12 - watch button
139:16 - oh watch button
139:21 - group watch button there we go awesome
139:24 - sweet
139:25 - so that's kind of that so group watch
139:27 - button is what we're focusing on right
139:28 - now at this point
139:29 - okay let's go ahead and create all these
139:31 - buttons right right so let's go ahead
139:32 - and do
139:32 - the bottom let's go to the bottom we
139:34 - don't need any of this just yet
139:36 - okay let's go to the bottom and we'll
139:38 - just go ahead and
139:39 - focus on the buttons themselves so let's
139:41 - do the following so here we'll say
139:43 - const play button right is equal to
139:46 - styled dot
139:48 - div right that's that okay next one is
139:51 - going to be which one
139:52 - next is going to be the trailer button
139:54 - so it's a const
139:55 - trailer button
139:58 - right is equal to styled styled
140:03 - same thing here nasa is going to be
140:05 - const which one
140:06 - the add button right here
140:10 - and that's going to go to styled.div as
140:12 - well
140:15 - boom nice last one is going to be
140:18 - the group watch button oop
140:21 - oops oopsie daisy
140:26 - group watch button
140:29 - is equal to also style that div
140:34 - boom all right let's see what
140:37 - these now have inside okay so let's try
140:40 - this
140:40 - let's go and take a look at this nothing
140:43 - they have absolutely nothing
140:44 - but also we made it with small mistakes
140:46 - because this needs to actually be a
140:47 - button so we need to go
140:50 - call this button now this is by button
140:53 - you see
140:53 - button button button button okay
140:57 - so that's it we've got ourselves a
140:59 - button they have nothing inside them
141:00 - right now but we'll fix that here in a
141:02 - little bit
141:03 - okay so let's go take a look at the
141:05 - actual buttons when what
141:07 - we need to have inside them well the
141:09 - button will push part one the buttons
141:11 - will have
141:12 - uh kind of like things inside of it
141:14 - right so every single button
141:16 - well let's look at the play button first
141:18 - for example here
141:20 - so play button has what the play icon
141:22 - and the text play
141:23 - so we'll give it an image here so we'll
141:24 - do image
141:27 - image source is equal to
141:31 - equal to what is equal to dash
141:34 - images okay dash
141:38 - the play icon black button that we have
141:40 - actually inside of images which we
141:41 - downloaded by the way
141:43 - right here boom right there so that's
141:46 - the one we need to use
141:48 - okay that's gonna be our images inside
141:50 - the play button and then we need to go
141:52 - ahead and create a span
141:55 - and that's going to say play
141:58 - right there play let's put it in capital
142:01 - letters so it's easier for us
142:03 - yeah let's look at this oh let's go it
142:06 - looks so bad but it's there
142:09 - right let's do the same thing with the
142:10 - trailer button as well so we can focus
142:12 - on two at the same time okay
142:14 - so do the trailer button the same time
142:16 - same thing with this one
142:17 - it's going to copy this image put it in
142:20 - the trailer button
142:22 - right but this time the trillion button
142:24 - is going to be
142:25 - play icon white
142:28 - not black but white this one
142:32 - hopefully you guys are still with me all
142:33 - right and then we have what then we have
142:35 - the span
142:37 - right that's pain and so it's just a
142:39 - wrapper and that will be what the
142:41 - trailer button
142:43 - that's it okay all right so now we have
142:46 - two buttons you can see here
142:47 - one is truly one is played they have
142:49 - different styling for them
142:51 - so that's what we need to put what we
142:52 - need to focus on now at this point let's
142:54 - go
142:54 - let's go now to our play button and a
142:57 - few things that we need to focus on
142:59 - on the play button well a few things
143:01 - let's think about
143:02 - part one let's think about the border
143:04 - radius right so let's go ahead because
143:05 - it kind of looks horrible right now so
143:07 - let's do
143:07 - border radius
143:11 - radius right and let's give it four
143:13 - pixels border radius
143:16 - so it's a little bit cleaner and so
143:18 - forth so border is for pixels
143:20 - and so forth okay next up let's change
143:22 - the font size of this so we'll do font
143:23 - size
143:24 - just a bit of a more of a font size okay
143:28 - all right so it's a little bit bigger
143:29 - now at the same time now you can see how
143:31 - these play buttons oh my god let me go
143:32 - ahead and remove this portion right here
143:34 - we don't need that
143:34 - you see these butt play buttons you see
143:36 - how they're not kind of like aligned
143:37 - aligned uh horizontal vertically
143:39 - correct so we can do this use display
143:41 - flag so i can display flex
143:45 - display flex to vertically align them
143:48 - okay oh don't worry about that don't
143:50 - worry about that that's fine
143:52 - and i will say here align items
143:56 - a line line align
144:00 - with their items center
144:03 - boom boom you see now the play button is
144:06 - aligned now
144:07 - let's go ahead and make sure that all of
144:08 - these but are aligned horizontally as
144:10 - well
144:11 - to do that we do go to controls and i
144:13 - say here display flex
144:17 - display flex flex and what do we say
144:21 - see that puts them in a in a row by row
144:24 - fashion
144:24 - because by default the flag's direction
144:27 - is row not column
144:28 - you see and so we go that puts them into
144:30 - like the it's one row basically right
144:32 - into one row
144:34 - all right so that's good flex direction
144:36 - is basically in the one row
144:37 - now let's go ahead and do the following
144:39 - for the play button let's give the
144:40 - height
144:43 - let's get a height of 56 pixels
144:49 - all right so it's a little bit a little
144:51 - bit bigger
144:52 - okay and let's uh do the following let's
144:54 - go ahead and give a um
144:57 - let's think about this here for a second
144:59 - i will go ahead and actually say
145:02 - background color let's give that let's
145:03 - change the background color for this one
145:04 - so say background color
145:06 - i'll just do this boom
145:10 - so background color should be that now
145:12 - of course it's not
145:13 - that just yet let's go ahead and remove
145:15 - the border
145:18 - border border can you see you see how i
145:21 - had the border that's the hideous right
145:22 - now
145:23 - hey there we go so much better look at
145:25 - that so much better all right
145:27 - let's also add a little bit of species
145:29 - on the left hand side and our right hand
145:31 - side and to do that all we do is we
145:32 - simply just do
145:33 - uh padding right so we do padding
145:37 - so padding zero pixels on the top or
145:41 - bottom
145:42 - and the butt on the left and right will
145:44 - do 24 pixels
145:47 - simple as that right there see and now
145:49 - let's go ahead and add
145:51 - uh let's add some margin so let's do
145:54 - margin right you see to make sure that
145:55 - it pushes this trailer one so we'll do a
145:57 - margin right here
145:59 - margin dash right like this and we'll
146:02 - give it a
146:03 - 24 22 pixel margin
146:07 - boom done with that it's already getting
146:10 - much much better than what we'll want to
146:12 - do
146:12 - let's also in terms of color the black
146:14 - color that's all good i like
146:16 - that uh let me think about what else do
146:18 - well so we think what should we do
146:20 - let's add some letter spacing let's
146:21 - change that up a little bit here as well
146:23 - so letter spacing just to space it out a
146:25 - little bit more
146:28 - spacing and we'll do 1.8 pixels
146:33 - right just spaces out just a bit more
146:35 - just more so it's
146:36 - yeah i like that a lot better actually
146:38 - yeah i like a lot better and that's good
146:40 - okay
146:41 - that's awesome unless of course let's
146:43 - make it a cursor pointer too
146:44 - right so that means when i can click on
146:46 - it i can hover over it because right now
146:48 - it's not a cursor pointer right so let's
146:50 - do cursor pointer
146:53 - cursor let's do pointer boom
146:57 - all right oh something happened oh right
147:00 - here
147:01 - right there so now if i hold the c it's
147:03 - a cursor pointer now okay good
147:04 - so now we're not there yet okay not
147:07 - there yet i like that now let's go look
147:08 - at the
147:09 - let's glue now let's think about the
147:10 - hover uh solution so on the hover of
147:13 - this we're going to use this again so on
147:14 - the hover of this on this whole button
147:17 - we're going to change the background
147:18 - color just a little bit right so here
147:23 - background see this
147:27 - boom so now oh boom boom boom you see
147:30 - right there boom boom okay good so i
147:33 - like that that's amazing
147:35 - that's awesome now the same thing is
147:38 - going to happen with the trailer button
147:40 - right
147:41 - with the trailer button now check this
147:44 - portion out
147:45 - the trillion button right has the same
147:47 - style
147:48 - as this except it changes a few things
147:52 - like for example the background color
147:54 - well check out what we can do we can
147:55 - actually import it we can actually use
147:57 - like for example it's kind of like
147:58 - polymorphism
147:59 - you know in classes but in our case we
148:01 - can actually kind of like import the
148:03 - style so i'll do styled
148:05 - play button look at this style play
148:08 - button
148:12 - see now it's the same great great great
148:15 - great great way
148:16 - but all i got to do now in order to
148:18 - change color all i do is the following
148:20 - i say background is going to be the
148:21 - following so it's the back i'm going to
148:22 - be a little more darker here
148:26 - boom and we're almost done guys guys
148:28 - we're almost done for today by the way
148:29 - just wanna let you guys know that
148:30 - almost done okay i like that let's do a
148:33 - little give it a little bit more of a
148:34 - border so i like that too
148:38 - more of a border one pixel solid so kind
148:40 - of like a white border as well
148:42 - and let's go ahead and let's do the
148:45 - following let's do a color so let's go
148:47 - ahead and do
148:48 - more of a white color i guess like a
148:49 - more of a lighter white color
148:54 - boom look at that oh let's go now of
148:58 - course
148:58 - also i kind of want to hunt if i go to
149:00 - here ah that's fine
149:02 - that's great oh let's go guys how cool
149:05 - does that look now
149:06 - all right uh let's make sure it's text
149:08 - text transform actually
149:10 - let's do text transform uppercase
149:13 - so make sure it's text transformed make
149:15 - sure it's all uppercase text
149:17 - transform this form
149:20 - let's do uppercase to make sure it's all
149:22 - uppercase
149:24 - okay save that boom done
149:28 - holy mo look at this guys that's so good
149:31 - okay so i like that so play trailer
149:33 - that's all there
149:34 - i love that portion okay let me go let
149:36 - me go let's close this out
149:38 - we have a few more ones which is going
149:40 - to be the add button so far let's go
149:41 - ahead and focus on the add button
149:43 - which looks a little bit more different
149:44 - right has like just only has is just one
149:47 - icon right
149:48 - so in the add button all we're going to
149:50 - do is simply just an image so that's all
149:52 - we'll do so any ad
149:53 - and the in
149:57 - the add button and all that will be is
150:00 - simply just like a
150:01 - background a background image let me let
150:03 - me think about this for a second here
150:11 - okay cool awesome sweet so in the app
150:15 - add list button it will just be like a
150:18 - plus that we need to
150:19 - go ahead and add and that's pretty much
150:21 - it so if you look at it here
150:23 - look at this inspect
150:27 - you see here we have the span
150:31 - spin so that actually creates like a
150:32 - really interesting solution
150:34 - but i don't want to do it that way
150:36 - actually i actually want to do a little
150:37 - bit differently you see we're going to
150:39 - just simply do a plus
150:40 - icon or just just simply just a plus
150:43 - that we're going to use inside our thing
150:44 - so look at this
150:45 - i'll see i will say here as i will say
150:47 - span
150:49 - i will say here span oops
150:53 - span plus
150:56 - right i know nothing crazy so far right
150:58 - but don't worry
150:59 - it's gonna happen right so to make this
151:02 - this one happen what's gonna happen is
151:04 - we're gonna give it a height and a width
151:05 - as well
151:06 - so let's go to the add button
151:10 - okay let's go ahead and give it a width
151:14 - of 44 pixels let's give it a height
151:19 - of 44 pixels okay good so that's
151:23 - that's awesome sweet that makes me that
151:25 - makes me happy
151:26 - next up uh let's go ahead and just hold
151:28 - it in the other one let's go ahead and
151:30 - do
151:30 - uh display flex
151:34 - play flex right
151:38 - okay now let's focus on the span do a
151:41 - span here
151:44 - let's do span and let's change the font
151:46 - size of this one to be
151:47 - more so font size
151:50 - is gonna be maybe 16 pixels 18 pixels
151:54 - let's see maybe maybe more what do you
151:57 - guys think 24 pixels
151:58 - 26 pixels yeah it's about that ah i
152:03 - would say 30.
152:05 - there we go much better all right all
152:06 - right so display flex we're going to do
152:08 - now align item center
152:10 - to align everything inside there
152:11 - horizontally or vertically
152:13 - align item center
152:16 - okay then we'll do justify content
152:18 - center to do aligning horizontally right
152:20 - so justify content center
152:24 - justify content
152:29 - justify dash content is going to be
152:31 - center
152:33 - done so that that's very nicely centered
152:35 - uh so forth
152:36 - let's do border radius to give it a nice
152:38 - circular border borders radius
152:42 - 50 of course nice look at that it's time
152:46 - to look a button right
152:48 - i like that all right so that's really
152:49 - cool that's really cool water radius
152:51 - all right and let's go ahead and do a
152:53 - background let's do
152:55 - i'll do background let's give it a
152:58 - border actually border of white
153:01 - so border here is going to be white okay
153:03 - so it's a white border that's awesome
153:05 - let's give it a different background
153:06 - color too a background color should be
153:08 - this as well
153:13 - done look at that right let's also do a
153:15 - color white
153:17 - color white on the actual span
153:23 - oh let's go look at that and then we'll
153:26 - do a cursor pointer on the actual full
153:28 - button so we'll do
153:29 - cursor cursor pointer
153:34 - boom right there and honestly that's
153:37 - that's
153:38 - pretty pretty much it will do here again
153:41 - there we go
153:41 - and then we'll do a margin right of 16
153:43 - pixels to push the other
153:44 - button away so margin
153:48 - margin dash right will be 16 pixels
153:54 - good so let's go ahead and save that all
153:56 - right save that
153:57 - all right it's going to refresh that
153:59 - beautiful oh it looks so good so good
154:01 - now you can see here that this button is
154:04 - not
154:04 - vertically aligned with all these other
154:05 - ones you see how it's kind of more the
154:06 - top
154:07 - versus more centered so how do we go
154:10 - ahead and do that to make sure it's
154:11 - fully
154:11 - centered well that's a very very simple
154:14 - solution honestly
154:15 - again display flex
154:17 - [Music]
154:18 - so to do that we go to our parent which
154:20 - is the controls the controls controls
154:23 - the controls controls everything right
154:26 - so we go to controls and where's the
154:28 - controls display flags and we do
154:30 - align items look at this
154:34 - center and watch it boom you see
154:37 - this just became centered just like that
154:39 - it's so simple
154:41 - all right so that's right there is going
154:42 - to be our plus plus button
154:44 - all right last button that we're going
154:46 - to focus
154:47 - on is going to be that's our button
154:51 - right there let me see
154:53 - right there last one is going to be the
154:55 - group watch button
154:56 - okay and i think it probably is the same
154:58 - similar button that we should use let me
155:00 - see coupon button
155:01 - but this one's gonna have an image so
155:03 - let's try that right right out
155:05 - so this one has an image right here so
155:07 - group watch button
155:08 - okay let's add an image here okay
155:12 - and we'll give the source is equal to
155:15 - okay is equal to what
155:16 - well we have a group icon that we can
155:18 - use right there
155:20 - so this is in your images folder if you
155:22 - downloaded it from the drive
155:25 - right there
155:28 - okay that's your image okay so that's
155:31 - good group watch button i like that
155:33 - that's awesome
155:34 - and again we'll do the same thing i
155:36 - think i think it's worth doing like the
155:37 - same thing which is
155:38 - also with 44 pixels and everything
155:40 - everything's pretty much you know
155:42 - similar
155:42 - so let's try that so we'll do i think we
155:45 - can probably
155:47 - let me see probably use styled
155:51 - actually this add button look at this
155:54 - guys
155:55 - add button oops no that's not the one
156:01 - okay so that's good all we need to do is
156:03 - just differentiate the color a little
156:05 - bit
156:05 - a little bit because you can see here
156:08 - it's a little more darker color here so
156:09 - we'll
156:10 - differentiate the color here just a
156:11 - little bit by giving it a
156:14 - darker a darker background color
156:17 - which is actually more of a more it's
156:19 - actually more of a background color
156:20 - black
156:23 - boom boom done
156:26 - done done that's it done
156:30 - look at that oh oh oh how good
156:33 - is that what do you guys think are you
156:35 - guys still with it yes or no
156:37 - we've got ourselves you see well very
156:39 - slowly we're turning out to have an
156:41 - amazing solution here

156:46 - by little we have css going so far look
156:48 - at this guys
156:49 - all right look at all these css we just
156:51 - did
156:52 - all using style components that's pretty
156:54 - pretty epic i will say so
156:56 - all right and we're not too far off from
156:58 - actually being fully done right now we
156:59 - have a subtitle
157:00 - then i'm going to do description and
157:03 - that's pretty pretty much it so let's go
157:05 - ahead and do that let's go finish this
157:06 - up
157:06 - let's finish it up with a bang you guys

158:28 - next thing uh we need to go ahead and
158:30 - focus on is going to be
158:31 - now this detail page which is this page
158:34 - right here
158:36 - i can actually just copy this for now
158:37 - temporarily i'm going to copy this and
158:39 - i'm going to call a subtitle here so
158:40 - let's go ahead and create a subtitle
158:42 - component so let's go ahead and do this
158:43 - so we'll do subtitle here actually not
158:46 - not a set of controls but actually it's
158:47 - outside of control so we'll do subtitle
158:50 - sub sub
158:54 - title okay
158:57 - all right subtitle and that's going to
159:00 - contain the actual text which is this is
159:01 - temporary text okay placeholder text
159:03 - that's all we know okay and then inside
159:06 - there we're going to create the
159:08 - description
159:11 - description and i'll give you guys you
159:12 - know the actual text if you need text
159:14 - but you can put anything you want in
159:15 - there right you don't even need just put
159:17 - anything you want let's just
159:18 - that's temporary until we actually get
159:20 - it from the database so for now just put
159:22 - anything you want in there okay
159:24 - so that's shin okay all right let's
159:28 - go ahead and copy this
159:31 - all right boom done nothing too fancy
159:34 - like i said right nothing too fancy at
159:36 - all
159:37 - all right of course we if we go back to
159:39 - our application says subtitles not
159:40 - defined that's the normal
159:42 - usual thing so what we need to do is to
159:44 - define it so we'll say the following so
159:45 - do
159:46 - style.div so const
159:50 - subtitle i'll go ahead and make sure you
159:53 - guys can see on the top here
159:55 - subtitle is equal to styled.div
160:01 - beautiful style.dip awesome sweet
160:05 - nice so this double dip that's amazing
160:08 - let's do something with the same thing
160:09 - with description const
160:12 - description is equal to styled
160:16 - dot do as well all right
160:21 - all right mateys oh what just
160:23 - happened
160:24 - what happened description what the heck
160:29 - i did not okay good like holy moly i
160:32 - would not just kill the whole
160:33 - application
160:34 - with this that'd be funny if i did
160:35 - though all right so
160:37 - for the subtitle it shouldn't be
160:38 - anything too crazy let's go ahead and
160:41 - um change the color just be a little
160:43 - more of a lighter color
160:45 - so i'm gonna do command click on this
160:47 - command click and this takes me to the
160:48 - actual
160:49 - style so that's one thing you can use
160:51 - color which is this color
160:53 - okay save that it's a it's just very
160:56 - light color okay font size 15 pixels
161:01 - so let's go ahead make this a little bit
161:02 - there we go a smaller font size
161:05 - let's do min height uh min 120 pixels as
161:08 - well
161:12 - okay let's also give a margin top margin
161:14 - top
161:15 - let's do margin top margin top 26 pixels
161:19 - to give it a
161:20 - uh what's it called
161:23 - there we go just to push a little more
161:25 - to the bottom here you see just to push
161:27 - it more to the bottom right here
161:28 - i like that okay so that pushes it more
161:30 - to the bottom and then same thing
161:32 - with the description let's go ahead and
161:33 - do that so now if we're in description
161:37 - let's look at the description here okay
161:40 - awesome
161:41 - that's pretty simple similar one as well
161:43 - right let's do
161:44 - we'll change the line height here for a
161:46 - little bit so we'll do line height
161:50 - line height we'll say one point
161:54 - four so it creates more of a spacing you
161:57 - see i kind of like that a little more
161:59 - let's do fonts let's give it more of a
162:00 - font size a bigger font size so font
162:02 - size
162:04 - 20 pixels so it's a bigger text boom
162:07 - beautiful let's do padding top
162:10 - is going to be so do margin top is
162:12 - actually going to be margin top 16
162:14 - pixels
162:17 - boom nice i like that awesome sweet
162:21 - uh let's do the same thing with the
162:22 - color right there
162:26 - with the color ah yes
162:29 - and well i mean that's that's pretty
162:31 - much it look at that
162:32 - holy mole let's go that's pretty much it
162:35 - guys how cool is that
162:36 - what do you guys think we have ourselves
162:39 - a detail page now yes
162:40 - it does not connect directly to the
162:42 - thing that's going to have the
162:43 - connection is going to happen tomorrow
162:44 - by the way the whole
162:45 - redux all of that that's going to happen
162:48 - tomorrow although redux connecting
162:50 - right you know the react router down
162:52 - with redux
162:53 - actually pulling them data from a
162:55 - firebase that's going to happen tomorrow
162:57 - who's excited for that let me know in
162:58 - the comments below who decided for that
163:00 - one
163:01 - that's going to be pretty cool that's
163:02 - pretty cool it's not easy but we'll do
163:04 - it
163:05 - right and the last thing that i kind of
163:07 - maybe want to touch on is potentially
163:08 - the login page
163:10 - so let's go and touch on the login page
163:11 - i think they'll be a lot of fun as well
163:13 - okay
163:14 - login page should not be anything too
163:15 - crazy so we'll just touch on the login
163:17 - page a little bit
163:18 - as well so what do we have here well we
163:20 - have the detail page which is here
163:22 - boom okay we have ourselves at the
163:26 - detail page oh that's the homepage and
163:27 - we have
163:28 - the detail page okay
163:31 - and then let's go ahead and create a
163:32 - login page uh well i'll get login page
163:35 - as well with this all right let me see
163:37 - so to do this let's go and create a
163:39 - login component
163:40 - so let's go ahead first is first let's
163:42 - go ahead and do
163:43 - add detail page in the
163:46 - detail page in our commit
163:49 - as always okay and let's do this let's
163:52 - do
163:53 - components let's do a login page so
163:54 - right click new file
163:56 - we'll do login login.js
164:01 - boom let's do rfce
164:05 - boom that creates the login page and so
164:08 - forth right
164:09 - okay so that's gonna be the login page
164:11 - okay
164:12 - and then what we'll do is very simple
164:14 - we'll to make this happen let's go to
164:16 - our home
164:17 - to our app.js and if there's a route
164:20 - that says the login route we'll just
164:22 - take it there
164:22 - so say route path
164:26 - is equal to what i'll just say login
164:31 - slash login then what do we do
164:35 - what do we do well we import the login
164:38 - component so we say import login
164:42 - from where from
164:46 - dash component dash what
164:50 - login done zone okay
164:53 - so marginal file you tend to import
164:55 - components
164:56 - let me see components login i create one
165:01 - oh it should be there let me see
165:05 - outside the project folder oh because of
165:08 - this right here
165:09 - done done ah awesome sweet let's
165:12 - do that awesome that's good and so now
165:15 - if we go to this you should we should
165:16 - use the logging components let's try
165:18 - to try that login component
165:22 - oh done
165:25 - all right let's go ahead and go to now
165:27 - let's go to our logging component
165:28 - oh let's go
165:32 - login boom login is all we got
165:35 - and if we go to login in the in our
165:38 - actual build function
165:39 - sign out here's our log component you
165:41 - can see not
165:43 - you know nothing nothing crazy so far
165:45 - okay nothing crazy so far
165:47 - and this is where we will be very smart
165:49 - okay you can see how
165:50 - the header is still the same but it
165:52 - changes when the log component is
165:53 - different so
165:54 - we'll do that tomorrow that's part of
165:56 - redux we'll have we'll make that
165:57 - tomorrow but today
165:58 - is we'll focus on this portion right
166:00 - here right we'll focus on this portion
166:02 - we'll create this button which is
166:03 - beautiful
166:03 - we'll create this image right here and
166:05 - then this stuff right here as well
166:07 - so a few different things that we're
166:08 - going to create right now so let's go
166:10 - look into
166:11 - well what components do we have for this
166:14 - well
166:15 - a few things we have the actual
166:17 - container
166:18 - that's the width 100 right okay
166:22 - then what i'd like to let me go ahead
166:23 - and put a rectangle here so we have
166:25 - this okay and then we have i like to
166:28 - call the content
166:30 - section why because it gets centered
166:31 - horizontally and vertically you see
166:33 - if i go ahead and look at the brush see
166:35 - it gets centered horizontally
166:37 - centered and also vertically
166:40 - right that's that right and then of
166:43 - course inside that we have a few
166:44 - different things we have
166:46 - well what do we have we have a few logos
166:49 - so we have a kind of like let me see i'm
166:51 - going to go direct and go here
166:53 - logo here that's going to be that's
166:54 - going to be a component that we're going
166:55 - to use as well
166:57 - then let me see let me see then we have
167:00 - a button
167:01 - called get all there button okay
167:05 - and then finally we have a description
167:08 - get premiere access
167:09 - and then finally we have another logo
167:10 - code like this
167:13 - that's it that's it that's pretty much
167:15 - it so
167:16 - uh with that being said let's just look
167:18 - into what we do you so let's go to login
167:20 - page
167:21 - login page i mean i login but just
167:23 - hideous right now but but
167:25 - login page let's start up with the
167:26 - container okay so we'll oh let's go to
167:28 - import style so import styled
167:31 - guys we're almost done we're going to
167:33 - create the login page and then almost
167:34 - done for today
167:35 - and then we'll finish up tomorrow okay
167:37 - so import styled
167:40 - from style
167:43 - dash components okay
167:51 - all right from stylish components okay
167:54 - that's awesome
167:55 - and this one let's go ahead and create a
167:56 - container here
168:01 - okay let's do const
168:05 - container is equal to styled
168:09 - div beautiful style.diff
168:14 - that's amazing okay so now okay a few
168:16 - things are gonna happen here at this
168:18 - point
168:18 - let's do the same thing remember in the
168:19 - con in specific container we need to
168:22 - one is we need to kind of change up this
168:24 - image which is a pretty cool image
168:26 - that's pretty pretty sweet and we need
168:29 - to add that background image in a little
168:30 - bit here so let's go ahead and add a uh
168:32 - well let me do a few things here the
168:34 - same thing we did before remember how we
168:36 - did that before
168:37 - let's do that right now so inside here
168:41 - this let's do a b4 just would do before
168:44 - so we'll do
168:45 - position relative here position
168:49 - position relative
168:52 - okay and we'll do the whole before thing
168:54 - which is what did the last time to add
168:56 - those background images right so we did
168:57 - like this
168:58 - but like this before before
169:01 - right like so right
169:06 - and of course number one i need to give
169:07 - this the continuity to give us a height
169:09 - so
169:10 - the height for this one
169:13 - is gonna be just how did the last time
169:16 - is
169:17 - a hundred vh minus
169:20 - 70 pixels done
169:23 - done okay 100 vh minus 70 pixels that's
169:26 - going to be
169:27 - just how we had it for all these other
169:28 - ones so that you're going to do the same
169:29 - thing for
169:30 - this one okay okay good before so that's
169:34 - going to be this relative now before
169:35 - with this
169:36 - specific one is we're going to add a
169:37 - background image so let's go and do this
169:39 - so
169:40 - we'll say here we'll say position
169:42 - absolute
169:45 - absolute
169:48 - absolute i will say top 0
169:53 - zero we'll say bottom zero
169:58 - bottom zero okay we'll say content is
170:02 - nothing
170:05 - it costs me nothing right
170:08 - just how we had it in the detail page
170:10 - right by the site it's just in this case
170:11 - we had
170:12 - the background was like you know we used
170:14 - an image inside that which is completely
170:16 - fine don't worry about that
170:18 - right content is nothing and then we
170:21 - will say go
170:22 - ahead and then bottom left zero
170:25 - uh all right zero as well
170:29 - zero good all right and now check this
170:32 - out now right
170:32 - all right that bishop and then we'll do
170:34 - of course this hold the whole z index
170:36 - now now now this point that's pretty
170:38 - much good so position relative on that
170:40 - that's all good i like the height here
170:42 - nothing crazy here
170:43 - let's do a background image now so say
170:45 - background
170:48 - dash image okay
170:51 - and we'll give it this url that's the
170:53 - login we have a background image
170:55 - we have a special login background image
170:57 - that we have which looks a little like
170:59 - this
171:00 - boom right now you don't
171:04 - really see it right now don't worry
171:05 - about that so what's gonna happen now at
171:07 - this point is
171:08 - default position absolute top zero
171:10 - bottom zero left zero right zero
171:12 - okay let me make sure it's all good
171:18 - good that's all great position
171:22 - before did they created before all right
171:26 - let me see
171:26 - or maybe it's after no no no no no no no
171:29 - no no no no no no no no no
171:32 - things like this
171:35 - wait wait wait it's after
171:43 - one before
171:50 - there's no before here that's
171:51 - interesting
171:53 - maybe it's after here let me see maybe
171:56 - it's after you guys see what i'm talking
171:57 - about
171:58 - let's see hmm
172:03 - see how did i do before
172:11 - let me see am i missing something here
172:14 - before
172:16 - no technology is good like this before
172:19 - back on url
172:23 - say there was an image slider right here
172:26 - before
172:30 - all right right there submission fixed
172:31 - position absolute top right content zero
172:34 - position relative okay
172:40 - bottom that's interesting
172:45 - all right let's see so before
172:48 - let's go back to our login page
172:52 - yeah that's right let's go back to our
172:54 - login page here
172:56 - uh not that that one do command p to go
172:59 - back to login
173:01 - okay so content nothing top zero bottom
173:06 - zero that zero is your background image
173:08 - is that one so do like this
173:18 - okay let's see
173:23 - just don't understand why it's not
173:24 - edited before content let me see content
173:31 - that's very interesting i don't
173:33 - understand why
173:39 - okay let me move this image for now
173:46 - okay what if i do exactly the way i had
173:48 - before
173:50 - before you understand why
173:53 - otherwise it would just not work let's
173:55 - go to log in the gs
173:57 - log in the gs let's see you guys do you
173:59 - guys see any issues that i don't see or
174:00 - no
174:01 - or am i blind to this
174:09 - wait now i did so what was i doing
174:10 - before that was not right
174:13 - what what i do before it's
174:16 - same ampersand sign same colon same
174:18 - before what
174:20 - oh man this is not cool anyways
174:24 - absolute good
174:25 - okay well i mean i'm not sure what that
174:29 - buy that hat but that made that happen
174:30 - sometimes
174:31 - is it called not semicolon absolute is a
174:33 - colon
174:35 - not semicolon oh is that why because i
174:38 - had this one wrong okay interesting so
174:40 - probably because of the thing okay
174:42 - that's fine so let's go ahead and in our
174:45 - login
174:46 - that's that makes sense okay so we'll
174:48 - change the background image
174:51 - i do not need this right now good
174:55 - so background image
174:59 - dash image boom
175:02 - oh there we go so much better we'll do
175:06 - a background position top
175:11 - position top okay so we'll start from
175:15 - the top we'll do a background size cover
175:17 - so it
175:18 - covers the full thing so background
175:22 - round size cover
175:27 - okay nice i like that it says cover
175:30 - and then because no repeat so it does
175:31 - not repeat basically the whole thing at
175:33 - all
175:35 - no repeat no repeat beautiful
175:39 - and that's it we've got ourselves a
175:41 - background which just looks so good now
175:42 - again
175:43 - this right here will change later on
175:46 - okay
175:46 - the most important thing is now let's go
175:47 - ahead and change up this stuff so
175:50 - now we need so we have this portion
175:51 - which is great
175:53 - let's focus now on the the actual what's
175:56 - it called the actual
175:57 - content so let's create the content
176:00 - which i'm going to call the content yeah
176:01 - i'm going to call it the content box
176:04 - the content box yeah that's what i'm
176:07 - going to call it
176:08 - the content box okay
176:11 - so content box right here
176:15 - beautiful content box and inside this
176:18 - content box
176:19 - is where for example our logo will be so
176:21 - for example actually maybe let's go to
176:22 - cta box
176:23 - with this call to action box okay cta
176:26 - what do you guys think maybe call it cta
176:28 - for now
176:29 - cta and inside here we'll have what
176:31 - we'll have the following we'll have
176:33 - cta logo one so let's do this cta
176:38 - logo one as could be an image
176:43 - and then there'll also be a cta logo two
176:45 - later on so let's start with the cta
176:46 - logo
176:47 - one which has a source we'll say source
176:50 - is equal to
176:52 - so is equal to right here
176:56 - and there will be right here cta logo
176:58 - one which we have in our images folder
177:02 - boom done right there cta okay
177:06 - and i'm just full so if we go back to
177:08 - here of course we have an issue here
177:10 - so cta that means to create a style
177:12 - component so i'll do
177:13 - so let's go ahead and do this so we'll
177:14 - do const
177:17 - cta cta equals styled
177:21 - dot div
177:25 - okay that's part one and then the cta
177:27 - logo one is it gonna be an image so
177:29 - okay const cta
177:33 - logo one is equal to
177:37 - what style dot image
177:43 - boom boom hey right there
177:46 - okay don't worry this refreshes no i'll
177:47 - work okay good awesome so that's fine
177:49 - that's awesome no problem whatsoever
177:51 - so now with this specific thing let's go
177:53 - ahead and i kind of wanted
177:55 - a um let me think about this here
177:59 - what height should we give it i think we
178:01 - should give it a a specific height i
178:03 - think we should give it
178:04 - i should give it a specific uh height
178:06 - and width so let's do this for the cta
178:07 - let's do a max width
178:11 - max so it's good to continue this max
178:13 - width
178:15 - of 650 pixels for example
178:22 - okay awesome and i also want to give it
178:26 - a
178:27 - specific ah
178:31 - let's do a top
178:34 - specific padding on specific padding so
178:37 - let's do
178:38 - padding so top is going to be 80 pixels
178:42 - top bottom 80 pixels
178:44 - and left and right are going to be 40
178:46 - pixels
178:49 - all right there you see i like that okay
178:53 - now so you see this kind of becomes that
178:54 - the whole dynamic here
178:56 - uh but actually yeah that's right yeah
179:00 - that's right
179:01 - yeah so now to make it all work properly
179:04 - what we need to do is
179:06 - uh we need to on this container we need
179:08 - to give it a position
179:09 - not position but display flex
179:12 - flex to make sure it's all centered and
179:14 - then oh wow let it just go
179:16 - display flex another just went
179:20 - and then we'll do a line item center
179:27 - where did the thing just go
179:30 - where'd you go don't leave
179:34 - all right so i'll bring you back okay
179:37 - that's interesting
179:38 - so if i don't if i don't do display flex
179:40 - it's fine
179:42 - display
179:46 - lex all right that's fine let's
179:49 - justify content maybe as well justify
179:54 - content center
180:00 - max with i don't like the fact that cta
180:04 - is just not showing up just kind of like
180:06 - that so that doesn't make sense at all
180:08 - um
180:21 - oh it's just it does not have a width
180:25 - that's why
180:25 - that's fine we'll give it a list we'll
180:27 - get it with right now
180:28 - uh let's give it a width of
180:32 - 58 let's give it a width
180:36 - with all let's just say 50
180:41 - there we go let's do more like sixty
180:43 - percent or something
180:47 - there we go maybe 70.
180:50 - there we go i like that okay that's good
180:53 - i like that
180:54 - okay and of course it's centered right
180:56 - there but you know
180:57 - then once you put in the other stuff it
180:59 - will center normally so okay just look
181:01 - in the center that's basically it's
181:02 - fully centered now in this position
181:03 - that's amazing i like that portion the
181:06 - next i need to do
181:06 - is create a sign up button so that will
181:09 - be inside here so we'll do sign up
181:12 - sign up so create a signup button so
181:14 - sign up
181:16 - sign up right there and then inside here
181:19 - we'll say
181:20 - get all there remember just like we had
181:21 - here so get all there
181:25 - get all there let's increase this width
181:29 - a little bit more
181:31 - like 80 i would say so
181:35 - okay same thing let's do const
181:38 - sign up equals styled dot what
181:42 - style dot style dot it's gonna be
181:45 - actually it looks like it's nate tag
181:46 - actually
181:47 - it's a nade tag right there
181:50 - done right there see all right awesome
181:53 - sweets wait tweet
181:55 - so that is all great um i like that
181:58 - portion
181:59 - nice that's gonna be good next thing
182:01 - let's go ahead and actually
182:02 - make that make this into a proper button
182:05 - well to make that happen
182:06 - the ghetto there we need to give it a
182:08 - number one a specific width so let's do
182:10 - that so
182:11 - we'll say width
182:15 - width of 100 okay
182:18 - that's fine i will do background color
182:24 - color and we'll give it this background
182:27 - color which is this one boom right there
182:32 - save that okay by color again not not
182:35 - nothing crazy right now right but that's
182:37 - again nothing don't worry about that
182:39 - just yet okay
182:40 - we'll do font away here bold
182:44 - weight bold
182:49 - okay and then what we want to do is
182:51 - inside this cta
182:53 - is we need to we want display flex on
182:55 - this one so to the cell so if we display
182:57 - flex on this one
183:00 - and now that's the only way to make this
183:01 - a tag all the way fully uh
183:03 - full width so display flex to this out
183:06 - right
183:07 - right so i know this one to the left
183:08 - hand side to the right hand side but to
183:10 - fix that what we do is do a flex
183:11 - direction so flex direction
183:14 - direction column
183:18 - column right that's in order to fix the
183:20 - the top to bottom see now it's fully
183:23 - kind of like top and bottom and so forth
183:24 - okay so i like that
183:26 - flash direction column and then what i
183:27 - want to do is i want to give it a

191:06 - smaller i want to make it just a
191:08 - little bit smaller
191:11 - and to do that i'm just going to add
191:12 - some padding on the right the left and
191:14 - the right okay so let's do that
191:17 - around this one so i'm going to say here
191:20 - tata
191:24 - oh actually no this looks good honestly
191:26 - i kind of like it though
191:27 - i kind of like this i want to center
191:29 - this more uh this is centered vertically
191:31 - but i want to sound this better a little
191:32 - bit better so
191:33 - we did do a line item center but i'll
191:35 - rather do it kind of like items
191:37 - top here right i know stop
191:41 - just how we have it here and then
191:44 - that's part one and then i kind of want
191:46 - to do it where
191:48 - uh that's pretty good i like that i like
191:51 - that and i'm gonna do opacity here
191:54 - opacity here let's say 0.8
192:00 - a bit more 0.7 just a little bit more of
192:04 - a darker
192:04 - theme you see i like that let's do a
192:07 - margin top
192:08 - actually on this whole shabang
192:11 - so let's do let me see i'm thinking
192:13 - about this
192:14 - actually kind of like that maybe
192:18 - let's do a margin top on this specific
192:19 - thing
192:21 - marched up on the whole container
192:24 - i'll do a margin top oops what just
192:27 - happened
192:28 - margin top i'm almost done guys see the
192:30 - sum margin desktop
192:32 - modern desktop let's do 200 pixels
192:37 - well not this one on the content itself
192:40 - cta here
192:44 - it's okay to go almost done no let's do
192:47 - 150
192:51 - no let's do 100.
192:55 - and we're there guys that is pretty much
193:01 - it look at that oh
193:04 - oh that looks good
193:08 - maybe maybe make actually let's maybe
193:09 - make this image a little bit maybe make
193:11 - this a little bit smaller maybe
193:13 - let me see a width of
193:16 - let's see
193:20 - with 90 percent and there we go
193:25 - and then inside here we'll go ahead and
193:27 - do
193:31 - that just like content cta so we'll do
193:35 - justify content in the cta to make sure
193:37 - it's all good
193:40 - justify no actually align item center
193:43 - align item center you see how currently
193:45 - it's not aligned like this you see
193:47 - you see how let me go ahead and remove
193:48 - this for you guys um
193:50 - secondly it's not aligned or
193:52 - horizontally well we can maybe we can
193:54 - fix it by saying
193:54 - item center but yeah right there see
193:58 - but not see usually when you do when you
194:00 - do horizontal align
194:02 - you want to use justify content center
194:04 - but because
194:05 - we did a flex direction column right
194:08 - and then they switch align items changes
194:11 - to horizontal direction
194:12 - just so the content changes the vertical
194:14 - direction so it's actually the switch in
194:15 - terms of uh yeah
194:16 - i know it's just weird like that for
194:17 - some reason but yeah that's pretty much
194:19 - it guys look at this we have ourselves
194:23 - the the image we have ourselves
194:26 - everything we have ourselves
