00:00 - - Hey, welcome, in this video,
we're gonna cover a lot.
00:02 - We're gonna start off by
what programming language
00:04 - should you learn first
in 2019 to get a job.
00:07 - Then, we're gonna talk about my story
00:08 - and what got me into programming,
00:10 - so it could give you a lot
of context around programming
00:12 - and why maybe you should get into it.
00:14 - We're gonna talk about web development
00:16 - and why I recommend that
you actually learn it.
00:18 - I think it's actually one of the easiest
00:20 - and fastest things to get into.
00:22 - I'm gonna talk about how I learned to code
00:23 - in less than three
months, and you can steal
00:25 - my framework to leverage it for yourself.
00:27 - Two powerful secrets of learning
00:29 - and shortcutting your success.
00:30 - We're gonna talk about leveraging risk
00:32 - to maximize growth, becoming a freelancer,
00:35 - work-life balance, and the 80-20 rule
00:38 - that I have on consumption versus creation
00:40 - as a developer that
will make a big impact.
00:42 - And the number one habit
00:44 - that successful developers must have.
00:46 - This is also cut out from a podcast I did
00:50 - with Ben McNeill, which was phenomenal.
00:52 - So for a lot of this, I'm
gonna cut to that podcast.
00:55 - I really hope you enjoy it,
let's jump right into it!
00:58 - Well, that's done.
01:00 - - That was it, baby,
you're a one-take wonder!
01:04 - - What made you jump on with Python?
01:06 - Cause I was researching kind of like
01:08 - some of your early videos
on your YouTube channel.
01:11 - It's basically like exploded.
01:13 - - Yeah.
01:14 - - Um, it looked you
were dabbling with our,
01:18 - I mean you kind of got, JavaScript is like
01:20 - you know, the web language,
so how did you land on Python?
01:25 - - I picked Python because
of the dumbest reason ever.
01:29 - In the start, I picked
it because I felt like,
01:32 - well, I didn't know anything about coding.
01:34 - I'm talking about like
when I did not even know
01:37 - what coding meant, and when
I wanted to jump into it,
01:40 - I looked up programming languages,
01:42 - and I picked the one that I thought
01:43 - the least amount of
people would know about
01:45 - and had the coolest logo.
01:47 - So I have like this very elitist mentality
01:51 - because I wanted to be sitting
01:52 - in a conversation with somebody
01:53 - and just go, "Yeah, I code in Python,"
01:55 - and they just go, "What the fuck?"
01:59 - I just wanted to elicit
that response from somebody.
02:01 - That was my initial beginning
02:03 - of how I got into, why I chose Python.
02:06 - Later as time progressed, I
started understanding coding,
02:09 - I started understanding
Python, then I learned Java,
02:12 - then I learned JavaScript
and all these other
02:13 - programming languages, I
started realizing, I'm like,
02:18 - Python is literally the
easiest way to start.
02:21 - Like JavaScript, there's so
many ways for you to fuck up.
02:26 - It's a language on the web,
you're not only dealing with
02:30 - the difficulty of learning the
programming language itself,
02:35 - you're now also dealing
with the difficulty of
02:38 - getting it to work on
the web, so some features
02:42 - might not work on Chrome versus Safari.
02:44 - Or they introduced this
new thing called ESX.
02:47 - And in JavaScript, it's unbelievable
02:51 - how many new things are
introduced and there are like
02:55 - 20 different ways of doing the same thing.
02:57 - So it's a great programming language,
02:59 - but if you're a beginner,
03:00 - it's much more likely to confuse you.
03:03 - Same thing that I thought about C++ and C.
03:06 - I'm like, you're literally
trying to write "Hello world,"
03:10 - and you have to create classes,
03:12 - know how to compile a code, know terminal,
03:15 - like, nobody's gonna learn this.
03:17 - Nobody's gonna be able to understand this.
03:20 - And with Python, you can run it anywhere.
03:23 - You need one line of code to start it.
03:24 - Most computers, especially MacBooks,
03:27 - come installed with it, and then I started
03:30 - really learning about that it's like
03:32 - the easiest programming
language in the world
03:34 - and all the universities
are switching over to it.
03:36 - It's one of the fastest-growing
programming languages
03:38 - in the world, and now, it really is.
03:40 - It's like 2018, it was more,
03:43 - Googled more than Kim Kardashian.
03:45 - So that should tell you something, right?
03:47 - - Right, yeah.
03:48 - - I gotta make a video on that still.
03:50 - And people, like Google
is built off of Python.
03:54 - Instagram is built off of Python.
03:56 - Spotify is built off of Python,
Quora, Hipmunk, DropBox.
04:00 - All of these are actually
built from Python.
04:04 - Sergey Brin, who's a
con-founder of Google, says,
04:07 - Python where we can, see where we must.
04:10 - - Yeah, that's awesome.
04:12 - - So Python.
04:16 - - Man.
04:16 - - When I was 12, my family
got into a car crash.
04:20 - And my mom's two back
discs, they got dislocated.
04:24 - And what ended up happening was
04:26 - none of my family members, my dad,
04:29 - who was doing two jobs at the time,
04:32 - my brother who was working
two shifts at the time,
04:34 - and both of my brothers
actually, and they were grinding.
04:38 - And none of us were able to
actually afford for her surgery.
04:42 - So none of us were able to
actually give her that surgery
04:45 - that she needed to fix her back.
04:47 - And over the course of 10 years,
04:49 - I watched that happen
for a really long time.
04:52 - And I love my mom, but I was never
04:55 - able to actually help her in any way.
04:57 - And none of my family members
could really help her.
04:59 - So I'm like, "Man, if these
people were doing two jobs
05:02 - "and they're grinding and they have their
05:04 - "software development degrees, and they're
05:06 - "doing everything right, and
they can't help somebody who
05:10 - "we love so much," I'm
like, "I have to figure out
05:15 - "some different way,"
and that's when I started
05:18 - jumping into the world of programming.
05:23 - - Wow, so it was kind of like a,
05:25 - like by accident or you
just, like were you,
05:29 - I know you have some background in chess.
05:31 - - Yep.
05:32 - - So you kinda have that logical mind.
05:33 - - Yeah.
05:34 - - Was it like something online, just like,
05:37 - "Hey, this is the way to do it,"
05:38 - you can be your own self-made person and
05:41 - kind of write your own pay checks.
05:43 - Like how exactly did that work for you?
05:46 - - So yeah, for me, it was
like I needed to figure out
05:51 - a different way of doing things.
05:53 - So in the start, it started off, yes,
05:56 - I have a background in
chess, I played that,
05:59 - and I ended up becoming, I mean
06:00 - I worked my ass off everyday.
06:01 - I had a great coach too, so thanks to him.
06:04 - But I was able to become top
1% in the world in chess,
06:08 - and in three year's time, I
put in like 15 hours a day.
06:12 - So I have that obsessive
mentality and that nature.
06:17 - Then I eventually switched
over to programming.
06:20 - Initially, when I got into it, it was,
06:23 - how I got introduced to it
was my brother called me
06:25 - and he said, "Hey,
programmers are making like
06:29 - "over $100000 a year coming
right out of their colleges."
06:33 - I was like, "That's fantastic,
06:34 - "I need to learn more about this."
06:37 - Then once I got into programming,
and I got into coding,
06:41 - I realized that I actually loved it.
06:44 - I really enjoyed it because it
was a perfect mixture of what
06:48 - like chess is, people
think it's all analytical.
06:51 - It's not true, it's the perfect
combination of analytical
06:54 - and creative, and it's
the two mixed together.
06:57 - That's how I see coding is,
and it's really brilliant.
07:02 - You could take something from your brain,
07:03 - from your mind, and you code it up,
07:06 - and then it turns into a reality.
07:08 - Like for example, when
you type in Facebook.com,
07:11 - it's almost as if you are entering
07:14 - the universe of Mark Zuckerberg.
07:16 - And now you're spending
time in that universe.
07:19 - It's pretty crazy, like
Instagram, like Boom,
07:22 - or whatever other website,
you're entering those people's
07:26 - worlds that they created, they
thought of, they dreamed of,
07:30 - and everybody's using
'em on a daily basis.
07:33 - And that is what actually
got me hooked to programming.
07:38 - - And you were talking about the web
07:39 - and how kind of adding that extra layer,
07:42 - I mean that struggle is real.
07:45 - - Yeah.
07:46 - - How did you kind of
like chunk that down?
07:49 - Cause you're learning, like the
web is almost its own animal
07:53 - so you're, 'cause you
basically specialize,
07:55 - you have the Profitable
Programmer, that's your flagship.
08:00 - - Yup.
08:01 - - Product that you sell, and that's like
08:02 - a whole, like web app, like,
08:05 - - Yeah, so the web world
is very, very different.
08:09 - And there are a lot of new
elements you have to learn.
08:12 - In my own world, we're not
talking about the business world
08:16 - and my just learning of coding, I tackled,
08:19 - first, it's learning the basics of Python,
08:22 - becoming really good at
it, so problem solving,
08:25 - creating games, solving
games like 15 or whatnot.
08:30 - Then I moved into, okay,
adding in an additional layer
08:34 - of complexity, which is like, okay,
08:35 - now I'm gonna learn
Heroku, and now I'm gonna,
08:38 - so like I can, because I want, I was like,
08:39 - "How do I host an app online?"
08:42 - And then I learned, it's like
Heroku allows you to do that.
08:46 - Then I'm like, "How do
I write code in Python
08:49 - "that I can, like, host online?"
and then I learned Django.
08:52 - And then I'm like, man, every time
08:53 - I do something with my app,
like things just go away.
08:57 - What do I do, and then I learned,
08:58 - okay, you need a database to save things.
09:00 - And I am like, okay,
PostgreSQL, that's a database,
09:03 - like a memory card that
allows you to save things.
09:07 - So that's what was happening in the start
09:10 - for me to actually jump into the world of,
09:13 - and I just started off by
creating my own apps that
09:16 - I enjoyed, so I was doing
a lot of private lessons,
09:19 - one-on-one with people, and I was
09:21 - always losing track of like,
okay, if I worked with Ben,
09:24 - how many lessons have I taught with Ben?
09:26 - Like, how much has Ben paid me?
09:28 - Versus like Frankie, you know,
09:30 - how much has Frankie paid me?
09:32 - How many sessions have I had?
09:34 - So I wanted to make my own,
09:35 - and everything I looked up online
09:37 - whether it was like Square
or other invoicing apps.
09:41 - They were all either too many
features or too few features,
09:44 - so I started building something on my own.
09:46 - And that was like super fast, but
09:50 - what it allowed me to do was, one,
09:51 - pursue a passion project,
and then I got to learn
09:56 - Django and Flask, and PostgreSQL,
09:59 - and how Jinja templating works,
10:01 - and HTML and CSS and
JavaScript and Python.
10:05 - Like, I was just building
the things I needed to build,
10:08 - so then it didn't matter what
I have to Google to learn it.
10:10 - And in the process, I
learned way more than
10:13 - if I would just like watch tutorials.
10:17 - - Right.
10:18 - - So that is the answer to how I navigated
10:21 - the waters in my personal
life and in my online program,
10:24 - which is like, I think,
what, it's 160 hours
10:27 - in the Profitable Programmer.
10:28 - That program, it was
very, that's why it took
10:32 - a year to create because
I wanted to make sure that
10:35 - somebody who's going through that journey,
10:36 - they're going through
that journey in a way that
10:39 - I went through that
journey, you know like,
10:42 - going from basics of Python to actually,
10:46 - actually really understanding
10:48 - the web development aspect of it
10:50 - along with like, "How do I freelance
10:52 - "and earn an income from
it?" because those pieces
10:54 - are a lot of the times not tied together
10:56 - by people for whatever reason.
10:58 - - So you were talking about
11:00 - going through the gauntlet right there.
11:02 - Can you just put a little color on that?
11:04 - - Yeah, so, sleep-wise, honestly, it was,
11:08 - I was going about 15 hours a day
11:10 - to 18 hours a day when I was coding.
11:12 - So like, on my YouTube
videos, I'll have like,
11:15 - you can learn coding in three months
11:17 - and actually start earning an income.
11:19 - And then a lot of people will be like,
11:21 - "This is inspirational," "This is cool,"
11:22 - but then I'll have people who go like,
11:23 - "This is bullshit," like,
"You can't do that,"
11:25 - "That's impossible,"
and I'm like, "Oh, man,"
11:29 - like I forgot to mention
the hard work aspect of it.
11:33 - Like, oh, I should've added that
11:35 - because I think what they're
thinking is I'm saying,
11:38 - is like I'm spending one hour a week,
11:40 - and then three months in, I'm like,
11:42 - "No, no, no, I'm spending
like 18 hours a day coding."
11:46 - So my three months are like,
11:50 - somebody's like two years, three years.
11:52 - - Right.
11:53 - - So that's the timeline that's being,
11:55 - but I'm not, I'm proud
of it that I grind it,
11:59 - but I'm not proud of, like
12:00 - I had to sacrifice a lot of things.
12:02 - I had to sacrifice literally a life
12:04 - of like doing other stuff.
12:06 - But I enjoy operating
in this obsessive cycle.
12:10 - So I remember I would go
with my best friend, Tenzin,
12:12 - who now runs a YouTube
channel called Whatsdev,
12:15 - and he started, we started,
I started my YouTube channel,
12:19 - then he was like, "Oh, this is cool."
12:20 - Then he started teaching his own stuff.
12:22 - And we used to go to this co-working space
12:26 - called PS1 which we had
found from MeetUp.com.
12:29 - And we would literally
be in the space for two,
12:33 - or sorry, like, we would
get there sometimes at like
12:40 - 1:00 PM or 2:00 PM, and
then we would leave,
12:43 - I kid you not, at 10:00 AM
or 11:00 AM the next day.
12:48 - So we'll literally be there
for 12 hours straight,
12:51 - then go home, then still code,
12:53 - sleep a little bit, come back.
12:55 - We had all these people
who would like go there
12:58 - and come back and we would still,
12:59 - like we would just be there all the time,
13:01 - no matter if they came
in at night or day time.
13:03 - They're like, "Do you guys ever leave?"
13:04 - And we're like, "No, not really.
13:06 - "It's just convenient that we're here."
13:08 - And I remember, we would be up until like
13:11 - 3:00, 4:00 AM, 5:00 AM, and we are,
13:14 - the whole thing, everything that we drank
13:16 - was just this thing which I'm showing.
13:18 - For the audio people who
are listening to this,
13:20 - it's a Monster, I'm
showing him my Monster.
13:24 - This is the low-carb Monster
because at some point,
13:27 - we realized we were
intaking way too much sugar.
13:29 - So that was actually our
replacement for water.
13:33 - And we just took that, we barely ate food.
13:37 - We ate like once a day,
which I don't recommend.
13:40 - But it allowed us to
really focus, really grind,
13:44 - and even if you don't follow
that path of doing it,
13:46 - 18 hours a day, most people can put in
13:49 - eight to 10 hours a day, people are just,
13:51 - sometimes, scared to put
in that amount of work.
13:57 - - Yeah, so you were talking about like,
14:01 - if they got plugged in to
the right training programs,
14:04 - could you shed a little color on that?
14:06 - - Yeah, so I think that you have to,
14:09 - you have to get good at failing fast.
14:12 - Just to get really good at
failing really, really fast.
14:16 - Like I don't think I,
there are a lot of people
14:20 - who've worked way harder than me
14:21 - for way longer of a time and
actually grind more than I do,
14:25 - but my results might be
better than some of theirs
14:30 - or somebody else's results who's working
14:32 - even less than I am or
probably better than mine.
14:36 - But one thing that
they're doing really well
14:37 - is they're intelligently failing fast.
14:41 - So, if you wanna start your
own business and you're like,
14:45 - "Right before I start the business,
14:46 - "let me actually go and take
this course from Coursera."
14:50 - It's a three-month course, it
talks about logos and colors
14:53 - and branding for like
literally three fuckin' months,
14:56 - and, "Let me go through that,
14:58 - "and then I'll try to build my business."
15:00 - No, just like, start
something the day after.
15:03 - Go to Shopify.com, buy a
domain name, put up a shirt.
15:07 - Then go on Instagram and just go,
15:10 - "Hey, I'm selling this shirt for $8."
15:13 - And see if somebody bites
on your personal Instagram.
15:16 - And then go to Facebook
and see if somebody bites.
15:19 - Those three months,
you will learn so fast.
15:22 - It didn't mean you worked harder.
15:24 - As a matter of fact, you might
have actually even worked
15:26 - less harder, but this is,
but what you will gain
15:32 - in those three months,
versus a three months of you
15:34 - passively consuming content from
15:38 - a Coursera University professor
15:39 - who's never ran his own
business in his whole life,
15:43 - you know like, you're not gonna learn.
15:46 - You're not gonna get, more
is caught than taught.
15:50 - So somebody who's teaching
you but hasn't done it,
15:52 - it won't actually make an impact,
15:54 - that much of an impact in your life.
15:56 - So, one, fail really fast, I remember
15:59 - when I was about to start
Clever Programmer 2016,
16:03 - I told Tenzin, my best
friend at that time,
16:07 - I mean he still is, I told him, I'm like,
16:09 - "2017, we have to fail 30 business ideas."
16:14 - That was our entire goal for 2017.
16:20 - We're like we have to fail
30 business ideas this year.
16:25 - And that expectation, then anything,
16:29 - even like getting any amount of traction,
16:31 - like I remember when I would get
16:32 - two subscribers from my YouTube channel,
16:34 - dude, I would run around in my underwear
16:36 - in my entire house, screaming
at the top of my fuckin' lungs
16:39 - and my parents would be like,
16:40 - "What the hell is wrong with you?"
16:41 - But they would like
love me and then hug me.
16:43 - And I would call my brothers, they go,
16:45 - "Oh my god, three subscribers,"
they like, "This is insane!"
16:50 - But my attitude was like,
"I'm going to fail for
16:53 - "30 businesses before I succeed because
16:56 - "it's a skill worth having so why should I
16:59 - "succeed the first time?"
17:01 - But I think where people fail is that
17:03 - whenever they're trying
to pick up a new skill,
17:05 - like programming, coding,
web development, business,
17:08 - they are like, "I've never done it,
17:10 - "but I should just
succeed the first time."
17:12 - And if they don't, they oftentimes quit.
17:15 - So that's one, now, more intelligent
17:19 - ways of getting there faster,
100% mentorship, 1000%.
17:25 - What I would do is, every time
I would teach a chess lesson
17:29 - and I would charge $35 or $50 for an hour,
17:33 - I would, then I wanted to learn coding.
17:35 - Then I would go home,
I would hire somebody
17:39 - on CodeMentor.io and pay them
17:41 - $35 or $50 an hour for
them to teach me coding.
17:47 - Because I realized that when you have
17:48 - somebody teaching you the correct,
17:50 - like I learned this lesson
because I spent three years
17:53 - playing ping-pong, then I went to a coach,
17:56 - and he told me that, it
actually would've been better
18:00 - if I played no ping-pong
those three years,
18:03 - because he says that I've been like
18:05 - forming these really deeply
ingrained poor habits
18:09 - that were like, now, are
biologically programmed
18:13 - into my being, unwiring
that takes a lot of time.
18:18 - So we spent the next year
practicing table tennis
18:22 - literally unwiring my poor habits.
18:24 - So, I mean the benefit that
you get from getting mentorship
18:29 - is like you will get to the
place you wanna go so, so fast,
18:32 - whether it's your friend,
somebody on MeetUp.com,
18:36 - somebody you hire from CodeMentor
18:38 - or Upwork or Fiverr.com, like mentorship
18:41 - will really, really help
you get there a lot faster.
18:45 - - Okay, and it really
sounds like, it can only,
18:47 - - Actively, I'm a big proponent
of that because every time,
18:52 - then, when I started charging $100 an hour
18:55 - for my chess lessons, I would
go back and I'd be like,
18:58 - "That buys me two hours
of a developer's time."
19:02 - And we're talking about a developer
19:03 - that has 10 years of experience.
19:05 - I have zero years of experience.
19:08 - By trading time and money,
19:10 - I'm getting to his level a lot faster.
19:13 - - Right, yeah.
19:14 - - That's all, I'm not going the wrong way,
19:16 - then the wrong way, then like
this way, then the wrong way,
19:19 - and then finally after 30
years, getting to where he's at.
19:22 - I'm literally getting there a lot faster.
19:25 - - As far as like business
building and family goes,
19:27 - there's some sort of balance there.
19:30 - How did you manage that?
19:32 - - So I, yeah, I don't do
a good job of managing it.
19:34 - I don't wanna teach
something that I don't know.
19:38 - But I will share my personal experience.
19:41 - I am getting, one thing
I'm getting better at is
19:45 - I try to see my parents,
they're in Chicago.
19:47 - So I try to see them a few times a year.
19:51 - Here's the big thing that I've realized.
19:56 - You can spend a lot of like
really low-quality time
19:59 - with the other person throughout the year
20:01 - and it actually won't mean much.
20:02 - And I'm talking about like you could spend
20:04 - eight hours a day with them
20:05 - and actually won't mean that much.
20:08 - But if you can get really good at
20:10 - cutting through the bullshit and spending
20:13 - deep, high-quality time with a person,
20:16 - that will change the
experience and relationship
20:19 - and influence their lives and your lives
20:21 - in a much deeper level and so then,
20:23 - you actually need very
little time, and you will
20:27 - still feel very, very
connected with those people.
20:29 - So for example, when I saw
my mom and my dad this time,
20:34 - in my whole life, I've
never really just told them
20:37 - exactly how much I love
them, exactly how much
20:39 - I appreciate the sacrifices
my dad has made for me,
20:43 - leaving Pakistan when he was
the president of a UBL Bank
20:47 - to come to United States,
work as a security guard
20:50 - because he wanted us to
have better opportunities,
20:53 - like literally telling
him that and thanking him,
20:55 - like, "I appreciate the shit out of you."
20:57 - Like, "Thank you for doing this,"
20:59 - and, "I will never forget
it," and then my dad and I
21:02 - crying and hugging it
out, that level of depth
21:05 - is actually more than I feel like
21:07 - me spending a year-long with them.
21:10 - So, to me, that was super powerful.
21:14 - Same thing with my mom, and then
21:15 - even when I see my brother
whenever I get to see him.
21:17 - So if you can take these really seriously
21:22 - and treat these relationships as like
21:23 - tomorrow, they'll just be gone,
21:25 - because they actually might be,
21:28 - if you give your heart in
the 24 hours or 48 hours
21:31 - or the one week or two
weeks you spend with them
21:34 - throughout the whole year,
that goes really, really far.
21:38 - So that is my way of "balancing" it.
21:41 - - How has your relationship
with money changed
21:45 - during this transformation?
21:47 - - So it changed a lot because
21:51 - I used to be just like my
family where they would be like,
21:58 - they never wanted to talk about money.
22:00 - Money was a source of like most problems,
22:03 - like bills, it was money, the next time
22:06 - we would talk about money was like
22:08 - my brother is not paying their debts,
22:09 - and my dad like scolding them.
22:14 - My middle brother's credit
score is being like super low.
22:19 - Every time we had a
conversation with our parents,
22:23 - it was some kind of
problem, a lot of times,
22:25 - it was like some kind
of problem around money.
22:28 - So, my experience with
money, my relationship,
22:33 - wasn't all that great,
but then as I started
22:36 - realizing and making my own money
22:39 - and earning an income, because I'm like,
22:40 - I wanna make enough for myself,
22:42 - and I wanna have enough to
help other people around me.
22:45 - And when that started happening,
22:47 - I started realizing that,
here's what money does.
22:52 - Money amplifies who you are.
22:55 - So if you're an asshole
with a lot of money,
22:59 - you have the capability to
be a much bigger asshole.
23:02 - If you're an amazing
human being, you can be
23:06 - even more of an amazing
human being with money.
23:08 - It doesn't change you,
it just exposes you.
23:11 - It just magnifies who you are, that's one.
23:15 - The second thing is that money is
23:19 - pretty directly proportional
in my worldview to freedom
23:25 - because what happened with me is
23:28 - if I'm getting money from my parents
23:30 - or if I'm getting money from my family
23:31 - or I'm getting money from the government
23:33 - or I'm getting money
from a job or whatever,
23:36 - I have to abide by those rules.
23:38 - I have to like, live by
those rules permanently.
23:42 - That is not freedom to me, that means
23:45 - I have to be afraid of I told you so
23:49 - for the rest of my life, I have to like,
23:52 - but having money, I can choose
to fuck up in my own ways.
23:56 - I can make mistakes on my own,
23:58 - and they're not gonna hurt
your bank account, Ben,
24:01 - they're not gonna hurt
my parent's bank account,
24:03 - they're not gonna hurt my brother's bank,
24:05 - they're gonna hurt my bank account.
24:06 - It allows me to take leadership,
24:08 - and it allows me to really just be free.
24:14 - - What do you think was the
24:15 - scariest part of that transformation?
24:19 - - Specifically what transformation?
24:22 - So you basically were like,
"I'm gonna start failing fast,
24:25 - "faster than I've ever failed before."
24:28 - - Yeah.
24:28 - - I mean did you have any
point where you're like,
24:32 - "No, I feel like I'm
jumping off of a cliff
24:34 - "without a parachute," like where you're
24:35 - looking at death in the eyes, you know?
24:37 - Was there any, like what was
kind of like a scary moment
24:40 - for that transformation, looking back now?
24:43 - - Yeah, so this is where
you have to be self,
24:45 - really self-aware because I'm very,
24:48 - I'm more risk tolerant than most people.
24:53 - My default is like very,
very pro-risk, I love risk.
25:01 - So this advice would work
for that type of person.
25:06 - So for example, what I
did, when I started seeing
25:09 - very little traction on my
YouTube, like very little,
25:13 - I don't even think I
had 500 subscribers yet,
25:15 - or maybe 1000 subscribers at this point.
25:18 - What I did was I said, "Okay,
here's what I'm gonna do."
25:22 - I went and I was making maybe
25:26 - $8000 to $10000 a month at that point.
25:29 - I was 20, 19, something like
that, oh, no, no, sorry, 22.
25:36 - 21, 22 'cause that was right
around, to my knowledge,
25:38 - 2016, end of 2016, and I'm like,
25:42 - "Okay, what I'm gonna do is, um,
25:45 - "go to every single client
and stop working with them."
25:49 - So I went and canceled working
with every single client.
25:55 - It effectively dropped my income from
25:56 - $8000 to $10000 a month to probably
26:00 - $1000 a month or less,
like nearing zero dollars.
26:05 - That's the first thing I did,
the second thing I did was
26:08 - I bought an office and a
bunch of shit on credit card.
26:12 - Like I didn't have any money saved up.
26:15 - Bought like my iMac, I bought my iMac,
26:18 - I bought this mic, I'm still
actually using this mic.
26:22 - I bought a bunch of lights
that I'm actually still using.
26:25 - And all that stuff was on credit card,
26:30 - and then I bought an
office space per month.
26:33 - So I went crazy on
expenses, monthly expenses,
26:38 - I dropped my income to zero, and I,
26:44 - because what I realized was I'm like,
26:47 - I'm sitting on a golden
opportunity and I can feel it.
26:50 - But unless I have like insane
biological pressure behind me,
26:57 - which will like, literally
like existential crisis,
27:01 - I will not maximize the upward
trend of this opportunity.
27:06 - I will be complacent and
I will get these results
27:09 - in 12-year time span, 12
years is a long time span.
27:12 - Whereas if I really buckle down
27:15 - and just add in this pressure,
27:18 - I will get these results
in a much shorter time.
27:21 - - Crazy, so you chose to
walk the plank basically.
27:25 - - Yeah.
27:25 - - Or that's kind of the
situation you put yourself in.
27:27 - - Right.
27:28 - - Yeah, that's awesome, so regarding,
27:31 - - I take pretty calculated risks.
27:33 - I'm also not like Logan Paul crazy.
27:37 - I love Logan Paul, he's incredible,
27:39 - but he is somebody who is like
27:41 - million times more risk averse than I am.
27:44 - And I admire him for that.
27:47 - For myself, like I am, I take,
27:51 - Even though I'm more on the side of risk,
27:52 - I still take calculated risks.
27:54 - So what I was trying to do in that time
27:57 - was replace the income
from my online audience
28:00 - because I knew once I could do that,
28:02 - that would be permanent.
28:03 - So what I started doing was
I started calling people
28:07 - from the Clever Programmer audience,
28:09 - and I was like, "Hey, do you wanna do
28:10 - "one-on-one sessions
with me?" and I was like,
28:13 - offering it for really
low, so I would just
28:15 - keep getting people, so somebody was like,
28:17 - "Sure, I'll pay you like $35."
28:19 - Somebody was like, "Sure
I will do it for $50."
28:21 - And I kept landing these
like one-on-one clients
28:25 - from within Clever Programmer.
28:27 - And then I started to launch my products.
28:31 - So in the first year of Clever Programmer,
28:34 - we did $211000 in the
business, November 2017.
28:38 - - That's awesome.
28:39 - - And that was because
I learned how to like
28:43 - do product launches and
learn email marketing.
28:47 - So yeah, there was like,
it wasn't that gung-ho.
28:51 - It was like, I spent a lot
of time researching and
28:55 - strategically understanding
what I'm doing.
28:59 - So email marketing and all those things
29:02 - were a huge part of like,
making my risk very data-driven.
29:07 - - Some people are not as
well-versed in executing.
29:11 - - So the same reason why
I, if I got into a fight
29:15 - with The Mountain, he's in Game of Thrones
29:18 - and he's also the world's strongest man,
29:21 - - Okay.
29:23 - - I would not even try because
I know it'll be worthless.
29:28 - I think that's the same reason
why people don't execute
29:31 - because they think that, in the end,
29:34 - it's gonna not amount to anything.
29:36 - And the reason why this happens is that
29:38 - I believe that people
consume, consume, consume.
29:44 - Think about doing, and when
they're about to actually do,
29:47 - somebody in their very shaky stage,
29:51 - somebody, like their wife or their teacher
29:54 - or their brother or their
mom, questions them.
29:58 - Or goes like, "What you're
doing actually doesn't seem like
30:02 - "the smartest thing," like,
"You should be focused on this."
30:05 - And they crack right away, they break.
30:08 - And constantly fighting
against that resistance
30:11 - is very, very difficult, so
what ends up taking place is
30:14 - you're exercising your
consumption muscles a lot,
30:18 - which is why everybody's
so good at consumption.
30:21 - And I don't have a problem,
I don't have a problem
30:24 - consuming something for eight hours.
30:27 - I'm actually starting to
have a problem around that.
30:30 - I actually start feeling like I have to,
30:32 - like if I don't execute on something,
30:34 - I feel like I have to, like let's say,
30:37 - you and I talk about, for 40 minutes,
30:39 - we talked about starting our podcast.
30:41 - When we talk about podcast
for 40 whole minutes,
30:44 - if I don't, if after that conversation,
30:47 - right around that time,
we don't actually start
30:49 - doing something, I will literally
feel like I have to puke.
30:52 - And like I can't be your friend anymore.
30:54 - I'm like, "Okay, we're not executing.
30:56 - "We're spending so much time
just talking about this."
31:00 - But let me get back to what I was saying.
31:03 - We develop really strong
muscles of consumption,
31:08 - but our muscles, muscle memory
of creation is very weak.
31:15 - So like let me ask you personally,
31:17 - how much do you value
creation versus consumption?
31:22 - If you can put it into percentages for me.
31:26 - - Oh, I am totally, well,
man, this is a tough question
31:30 - cause I, there's very
little effort to consume.
31:34 - And so if I'm not careful, I will consume.
31:38 - But there is, I mean that's
why I love programming so much.
31:41 - It's 'cause I get to create these things
31:43 - and release into the wild, but I mean
31:45 - as far as like tutorials go,
like if I'm not engaging,
31:49 - I mean I could watch programming tutorials
31:51 - and try and scale up that way,
but somewhere down the line,
31:54 - like you've gotta like create something.
31:56 - - Yeah, but you specifically like,
31:58 - would you say you're valuing consumption
32:01 - 30%, 80%, and then a creation comes?
32:04 - - That's a good question,
I think, man, that's,
32:09 - I probably would, it's heavier
on the consumption side.
32:13 - - Right, and that's how it is for,
32:15 - - Like 60%, 70%.
32:17 - - Okay, is that what you're actually doing
32:20 - or is that how you value it?
32:22 - Do you personally value consumption more?
32:24 - Like if I just asked you that question
32:26 - and I asked you about your beliefs,
32:27 - do you value consumption
more or creation more?
32:31 - Not what you're actually doing.
32:32 - - Right, now, like if, so this might be
32:36 - like a really poor analogy, but
32:38 - like I actually get high
off of creating things.
32:41 - - Good.
32:42 - - That is my drug, releasing awesome
32:46 - little cub robots into the wild,
32:48 - like that is like really just fuels me.
32:50 - - So in reality, you value creation more.
32:54 - And we're not talking about
what you're doing, but we all,
32:57 - - Right.
32:58 - - Not all but mostly like, so
if I'm asking you personally,
33:02 - you value creation more,
but then if you map it
33:05 - to your actual time in
your day, day to day basis,
33:09 - what you'll see is you're actions
are 70% to 80% consumption
33:14 - and your creation is at 20% to 30%.
33:18 - So your value, it might not be
33:22 - mapping to your actual reality.
33:24 - And this happens to all of
us, this happens to me too.
33:27 - And this is the problem that
we have to break out of.
33:31 - And the reason why this happens is
33:33 - we practice consumption so much,
33:35 - but we practice execution so little.
33:37 - We get into a habit of only
consuming and not executing.
33:41 - So for example, one way to
start it for most people
33:44 - is I remember every single
time, I was going through
33:47 - a coding tutorial, not every,
not literally every time,
33:51 - but a lot of the times, when I
go through a coding tutorial,
33:54 - I will be, I'll have my
computer side by side,
33:58 - and I'll be coding it up, otherwise,
34:00 - I feel like I'm wasting my
time watching that tutorial.
34:05 - And I also think that you learn,
34:07 - your learning increases way more,
34:09 - Like let's say, let's say that, Ben,
34:14 - you have to build an application
34:16 - that have to be posted, like
an invoicing app or something.
34:20 - The first thing most
people would do is like
34:23 - start researching what would be great
34:26 - and what would make you learn so, so well
34:28 - is if you actually spent the
next 36 hours creating it,
34:35 - not in a row but in the
next 36 hours, creating,
34:38 - over the course of a week
or two weeks, let's say,
34:41 - creating this and then
going to watch tutorials
34:46 - around like what you did and know.
34:47 - Then you'll pick up a lot more too.
34:49 - So if we practice our
exercising muscles a lot more
34:54 - and that becomes our
default, you will create
34:58 - a lot of amazing things
in the world because
35:01 - we all have the potential for that.
35:03 - You're already creating
this incredible podcast,
35:06 - and most people have the ability
35:08 - to create something incredible.
35:10 - It just requires a habit change.
35:11 - Like not only can you
be a YouTube account,
35:15 - YouTube consumer, you can be a creator.
35:19 - Like that's a weird switch.
35:21 - - With regards to habits, so um,
35:27 - what, 'cause you've worked
with a lot of students.
35:29 - You've seen transformations
in a lot of people.
35:32 - What is, like, these
habits that seems to be
35:35 - a recurrent theme with
the people that really
35:38 - start from ground zero and lift off
35:41 - or they basically become
from intermediate to mastery?
35:45 - Like what is a recurrent
theme with their habits?
35:49 - - Yeah, the biggest recurring
theme that I could say
35:52 - about the students who
are going on to succeed
35:54 - really, really well are that
students who are executing like
35:59 - maniacs, like literally
like maniacal execution.
36:04 - There's this one, Jubara, his Instagram is
36:09 - J-U-B-A-R-A, underscore,
Abdallah, so A-B-D-A-L-L-A-H.
36:17 - This guy who's in our
Profitable Programmer Course,
36:20 - like he's in all of the courses actually.
36:23 - He just executes non-stop, so like,
36:26 - I mentioned that you should have a
36:29 - Instagram and a YouTube channel
36:31 - and document your coding journey.
36:33 - He just started doing it,
so now what's gonna happen
36:36 - is not only is he gonna be
increasing as a developer,
36:38 - but he's literally building his brand.
36:40 - A year from now, two years from now,
36:42 - he's gonna have 50000, 30000, 50000,
36:44 - 100000 subscribers, like it's just a fact.
36:48 - Like he's just gonna have
the potential to make
36:51 - $200000, $300000 a year if he chooses to.
36:54 - Like the opportunities
in this modern world
36:58 - where we have the power of the internet,
37:00 - you don't have to go
through the ladder of like,
37:03 - first, get this degree,
then get this degree,
37:05 - then get this junior developer
job, then you get a senior,
37:07 - no, fuck that, like you
just, you actually increase
37:12 - on your pure merit, not on
some kind of bureaucracy.
37:16 - He is a massive executor,
and a lot of the students
37:21 - who succeed, they're massive executors.
37:23 - Like for example, we'll
be in a coaching call,
37:27 - and I'll be like, "Hey,
make a profile Wyzant,
37:29 - "take lessons, and start tutoring," like,
37:32 - "You can charge $50 an hour."
37:35 - And the next time I speak with them,
37:37 - they have the profiles up already.
37:39 - Two weeks from that time,
they're text messaging me
37:42 - that they've gotten clients.
37:44 - Whereas, I have another student who is,
37:48 - who's watched every single
one of my tutorials,
37:50 - has spent 160 hours consuming my content,
37:54 - is watching every single YouTube
video I've ever produced,
37:57 - but they don't have a single app.
37:59 - They're better than all of
these other people, skill-wise,
38:02 - but they don't have a
profile that they've made,
38:04 - they don't have a YouTube channel,
38:06 - they're not creating apps, and you know,
38:08 - if the tree doesn't fall, if
a tree falls in the forest,
38:11 - no one's there to hear it,
it doesn't make a sound.
38:13 - If a developer doesn't make
38:14 - a fuckin' app, he's not a developer.
38:19 - - Fair enough.
38:20 - - Yeah.
38:22 - - Yeah, that's legit, man.
38:25 - So I have kind of like a
little lighting around for you.
38:28 - - Awesome.
38:29 - - So I'm personally fascinated about this.
38:32 - I'm sure some other
people are, but just like,
38:34 - the behavior of top performers.
38:37 - So when you kick your day off,
38:40 - what is non-negotiable for
you in that morning routine?
38:43 - - I have done lots of morning routines,
38:46 - but what I've realized is I'm very random.
38:52 - - Okay.
38:54 - - It's gonna be a shitty
answer, but like I don't,
38:57 - I don't have a morning routine.
38:59 - Sometimes, I do, like I'm reading,
39:01 - I'm watching too much and like
39:03 - reading too much about meditation books.
39:05 - So like in that time frame,
one to two-month period,
39:08 - I'll have a morning
routine, it really helps me
39:10 - having a morning routine,
like if I wake up at 5:00 AM
39:14 - and then I shower, and then I like write,
39:16 - and then I drink my
coffee, helps tremendously.
39:19 - Going to the gym, but right now,
39:21 - I'm trying to keep it at, like, my mind
39:25 - is on production and everything,
39:26 - and it's just not my habit to focus on it.
39:28 - So my real answer is like I
don't have a morning routine.
39:32 - If you wanna become a developer,
39:33 - you don't have to wait
nine years to get a degree
39:37 - and PhDs and then go looking,
39:40 - you can literally, today, like today,
39:43 - make a post on Craigslist, like,
39:45 - "I'll charge you $15 an
hour, I can teach you coding.
39:48 - "I have three months of experience."
39:50 - Or you can do, "I am a
local website builder,
39:54 - "and this is my rate, $20 an hour," like,
39:57 - "You can reach out to me, contact me.
39:58 - "Here's my phone number,"
or you can actually
40:00 - start calling or physically going to local
40:03 - businesses around you to help them.
40:05 - So if you, but I promise, most
people aren't even spending
40:09 - 5% of their week on this, right?
40:13 - Whereas, they should be spending,
40:15 - 80% of their week on finding
jobs and clients and work.
40:21 - And honestly, 20% of your
week should be consumption,
40:25 - which is actually improving
your coding skills
40:27 - and consuming content and tutorials.
40:30 - I hope you took a lot out
of it, and we covered a lot.
40:33 - I have always wanted to
put something together
40:36 - where you could get massive
value out of something
40:38 - and go through this entire experience
40:41 - from zero to learning how to freelance
40:43 - and to be able to land
clients and learn how to code.
40:46 - And I put together this
three-part master class
40:50 - that is absolutely free for you.
40:51 - I put in the link below, you can go on it,
40:54 - pop in your email and I'll send
you the three-part training.
40:57 - It will teach you how to
freelance, it will teach you
41:00 - coding skills, it will
give you a free portfolio,
41:02 - a calculator, and a whole
lot of other cool things,
41:07 - and help you accelerate towards
your success in your career.
41:10 - As always, this is Qazi, I love your face.
41:13 - I'll see you in the next video.
41:16 - Pow.
