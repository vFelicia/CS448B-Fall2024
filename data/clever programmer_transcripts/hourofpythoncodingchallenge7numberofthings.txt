00:00 - [Music]
00:04 - hey guys how's it going welcome back we
00:08 - are doing again the hour of Python
00:10 - coding challenges
00:11 - this is Kazi from clever programmer calm
00:13 - and hopefully the Oxford challenge went
00:16 - really well for you guys in this video
00:19 - what we're going to cover is the number
00:20 - of things challenge this one is actually
00:22 - kind of cool so take a try take a stab
00:26 - at this if you're watching this on
00:27 - YouTube pop open your own command line
00:29 - on my website code it right below this
00:32 - video and we're just going to kind of
00:35 - jump right into this one okay so the
00:37 - problem basically says if I give you
00:39 - something like if I give the function
00:41 - how many a list that that is a number
00:44 - like five followed by you know string
00:46 - like trinket it just says there are five
00:49 - trinkets and if I gave you something
00:51 - like one King it should go there is one
00:54 - King so this is kind of tricky right how
00:57 - do I take this list and then turn it
01:00 - into these human sentences that kind of
01:03 - makes sense that's tricky
01:05 - and notice it even ends of the period so
01:07 - how do we go about and do all this stuff
01:10 - well one thing that's important for us
01:12 - to know is like how to concatenate
01:13 - strings which is just a fancy website
01:16 - how do we put strings together the
01:19 - things in the quotes so if I have like a
01:21 - string that says hello if I want to add
01:24 - a period after it I could just do
01:27 - something simple like this hello plus
01:30 - that's the concatenation part okay fancy
01:33 - word remember that because when you're
01:34 - at that job interview could impress them
01:36 - with this but that plus sign is used to
01:38 - combine two strings just like + combines
01:42 - two numbers right one plus one and it
01:45 - combined a hello and the period and turn
01:47 - it into one string not two strings out
01:49 - three strings one string okay so let's
01:52 - go back just like when you do one plus
01:54 - one you don't get 11 think of it like
01:56 - that okay so now what I want to do is I
02:01 - want to take anything that's greater if
02:04 - anything is 1 then I want you to return
02:08 - the singular version and otherwise I
02:12 - want you to return the plural for
02:13 - we'll keep it simple so I'm going to say
02:16 - if how do we index again give this a try
02:21 - before you see my solution and we're
02:24 - doing this live so if I'm making any
02:25 - mistakes I'm making it live okay we're
02:27 - not going to like edit this because I
02:29 - want us to go through that process of
02:31 - thinking and how we kind of go about
02:33 - solving it so if the first guy is one
02:39 - then what I would like to say is that I
02:43 - would like to say there is so maybe I
02:46 - will say return there is right and put a
02:53 - space here plus the list and then I'll
02:58 - actually get the number and the number
03:00 - is not a string it's an integer so what
03:04 - happens when you try to combine a string
03:06 - with an integer well let's see if you
03:08 - have something like there are and then I
03:13 - want to add here an integer I get an
03:16 - error an error says type error must be
03:19 - string not int means string can only
03:22 - combine other strings with it they're
03:24 - not there they have to be like terms all
03:27 - right
03:27 - so in this case how there are is a
03:33 - string but five is an integer right so
03:35 - we want to do is we want to convert that
03:37 - 5 into a string then we could add it and
03:41 - there's a function that allows us to do
03:43 - that so as you can see if I pass in
03:45 - string if I pass in 5 to the function
03:48 - string then the 5 turns into a string so
03:53 - what I can do is just call string like
03:55 - this and there you go you get there are
03:58 - 5 and not that stupid type error that we
04:01 - got last time so return there is and
04:05 - then the list we index as zeros item
04:08 - zero sytem is going to be the number
04:09 - they give us so there is one and then we
04:14 - want to do plus again here and we want
04:16 - to wrap this in string remember and what
04:20 - I want to say here is the last item okay
04:24 - so I can just do
04:27 - the list and then give me the last item
04:31 - like that or I could be fancy and do
04:33 - this I put a negative one there that
04:36 - goes wraps around gets the last element
04:39 - but we'll keep it simple so I'll just
04:41 - say give me the second element now the
04:43 - only thing that we have to watch out for
04:45 - here is that we need to put that space
04:48 - that all-important space so what we're
04:51 - going to do is just do this okay
04:55 - and so this goes there is space one
05:01 - space
05:02 - King okay that's how it should read and
05:07 - then what we'll do for the other one
05:09 - it's pretty much a similar thing okay
05:15 - else will have the same statement except
05:20 - we'll switch it with there are and then
05:25 - remember we need to add a little s and a
05:27 - period at the end okay so when we want
05:31 - to say King we want to say Kings period
05:34 - and we want to set trinkets period and
05:40 - here we just want to say a period okay
05:43 - add a little little that guy right there
05:49 - okay let's give this a try and let's see
05:55 - what happens I could be totally off here
05:58 - there are five trinkets
06:00 - there is one King five trinket so five
06:05 - trinkets should give us there are five
06:06 - trinkets and we get there are five
06:08 - trinkets and how many one King should
06:11 - give us there is one King and when we
06:13 - call that on line 19 we do get there is
06:16 - one king all right guys we nailed this
06:19 - one this one was beautifully done we did
06:21 - a great job if you didn't get it that is
06:24 - totally fine just close this out come
06:27 - back thirty minutes later with a blank
06:28 - brain and try to do it on your own a lot
06:31 - of the times when you're doing these
06:32 - coding challenges from scratch they
06:34 - don't flow like how I'm doing this right
06:36 - now because right now python is more of
06:38 - a language to me that
06:40 - like English I'm like thinking in it for
06:43 - you that might not be the same thing
06:45 - you're going to struggle with it that's
06:46 - what would happen to me and I would like
06:48 - literally be pulling my hair trying to
06:51 - solve these challenges but just not give
06:53 - up so they're you know that headache
06:57 - that you get from sometimes doing these
06:59 - problems is how I think of it is
07:01 - literally your brain actually expanding
07:04 - so don't take it as a bad sign and if it
07:08 - takes you like two three four hours to
07:10 - actually solve this that's not a bad
07:12 - thing at all okay don't be like it's a
07:14 - cause you look two minutes it should
07:16 - take me the same time no of course not
07:18 - I've done this more times than you have
07:20 - unless you're a C programmer you
07:22 - probably smoked me too but hopefully
07:25 - this made sense hopefully you were able
07:28 - to solve this you learn something new
07:30 - put your solutions in the comments below
07:32 - I would love to check them out and so
07:34 - with the other people in at clever
07:36 - programmer anyways guys thank you so
07:39 - much for watching I love you guys so
07:41 - much and as always I'll see you in the
07:44 - next video
