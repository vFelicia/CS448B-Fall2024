00:00 - what's going on guys this is david from
00:03 - coverprogrammer.com and today
00:05 - we have an awesome topic for you guys
00:09 - which is becoming a back-end developer
00:12 - in 2021 now
00:16 - this is this video is going to be jagged
00:18 - with a ton of value
00:20 - so with that said let's get started
00:24 - alright so before we begin it's
00:27 - time to focus so please please make sure
00:30 - that your phone
00:31 - is turned off just throw it away to the
00:33 - other side of the room
00:34 - and why don't we just jump right in
00:38 - i'll tell you why you haven't smashed
00:40 - that like button just yet
00:41 - it's time i'll wait you done it
00:45 - okay let's get started so
00:48 - becoming a back-end developer in 2021
00:52 - let's first talk about the basic skills
00:54 - that you will need
00:55 - to become a back-end developer all right
00:59 - so you definitely need a profession
01:02 - knowledge in a back-end programming
01:04 - language or framework
01:05 - something um you will need
01:08 - the ability to manage and host an
01:11 - environment
01:12 - full of application and database and
01:14 - administration and all that stuff
01:16 - you will also need to understand a bit
01:18 - of a front end
01:20 - so html css and javascript is your
01:23 - friend
01:23 - this time you will also need to have a
01:26 - bit of experience
01:28 - with uh git version control or any other
01:31 - type of version control
01:34 - and the knowledge and the accessibility
01:37 - and security and compliance
01:39 - all right so i know
01:42 - this is why you came here for let's
01:45 - discuss how much a back-end developer
01:48 - actually makes um
01:51 - so how much does a back-end developer
01:53 - make in the united states so
01:55 - according to indeed.com the average base
01:59 - salary
01:59 - of a back-end developer is
02:03 - a hundred and twenty-five thousand
02:05 - dollars
02:06 - actually even more sometimes
02:10 - now this is just the average it can peak
02:13 - out
02:14 - further usually the cash bonus is an
02:16 - additional 4k
02:18 - all right so
02:22 - uh according to another website this is
02:25 - actually
02:25 - 75 000 uh per year
02:29 - um but we have glassdoor as well which
02:32 - says 100
02:34 - 000 plus so we can confidently say that
02:39 - a back-end developer usually makes
02:41 - enough to
02:43 - not go bankrupt uh easily
02:47 - all right usually like over six figures
02:50 - so uh let's talk about the opportunity
02:53 - to become a back-end developer
02:55 - in 2021 now
02:58 - let's take a look at a couple of
03:00 - websites
03:03 - of all the opportunities so first up
03:06 - uh here we got glassdoor.com
03:10 - now glassdoor.com alone has
03:13 - almost 4 000 uh
03:16 - backhand job listings all alone and we
03:19 - haven't talked about any other sites yet
03:22 - let's take a look at it so indie.com has
03:26 - an additional
03:27 - 5 and 500 plus
03:30 - jobs as a back-end developer just in the
03:33 - united states
03:35 - so i think this is a huge huge
03:38 - opportunity for everybody uh out there
03:41 - who wants to become a programmer
03:43 - a developer especially a back-end
03:45 - developer
03:46 - so with that said let's dive into the
03:48 - meat and the potatoes
03:50 - all right so uh you definitely need to
03:52 - understand and learn the basics of html
03:56 - css and javascript because
04:00 - it is what it is next up let's
04:03 - actually learn a programming language um
04:07 - you can choose javascript python
04:10 - php not recommended though java
04:14 - c-sharp and go as well
04:17 - now i just told you like six different
04:20 - programming languages you might be like
04:21 - oh my god which one
04:22 - do i choose uh so let's actually take a
04:26 - look at the surveys and all that stuff
04:28 - so according to the stack overflow
04:30 - developer
04:31 - survey 2020 the most
04:35 - wanted programming language is python
04:38 - next up javascript and
04:42 - on the third place there is go
04:45 - so these are the programming languages
04:48 - to go for
04:50 - and let's actually take a look at the
04:52 - top two
04:53 - so python versus javascript um
04:57 - quickly so javascript is front and and
05:00 - backend so
05:02 - javascript for the win but why
05:06 - let's take a look at that so what can
05:08 - you actually do with javascript you can
05:10 - build
05:11 - web apps like progressive web apps there
05:13 - is a react which is an
05:15 - awesome framework next up we got react
05:17 - native
05:18 - so if you know already react you can
05:21 - actually go ahead and build
05:22 - native mobile apps with react native
05:26 - and you can of course create server side
05:28 - applications
05:29 - uh that's why we got node.js all right
05:32 - now
05:33 - let's take a look at where can you like
05:35 - this is good but where can you learn all
05:37 - these
05:39 - on this channel we have a ton
05:42 - of develo uh development crash courses
05:46 - on youtube we got the eight hour
05:48 - javascript course
05:50 - we got the react tutorial 2021
05:53 - we got mirn stack tutorial 2021
05:57 - we got html courses css courses
06:00 - python courses we got everything on this
06:03 - channel so make sure you check it out
06:05 - go ahead subscribe right now
06:08 - i'll wait just a sec so you don't miss
06:10 - out anything
06:11 - okay subscribe hit the bell good
06:15 - let's go so uh let's learn the back end
06:19 - framework
06:19 - now what the heck is that so
06:23 - which framework to choose actually that
06:24 - let's go that way like this is
06:26 - node.js that you want to go with uh
06:30 - or the other uh other frameworks which
06:33 - are
06:34 - awesome are django asp.net core
06:37 - flask express spring and ruby on the
06:40 - rails
06:42 - and actually the framework is depends on
06:44 - the language that you
06:46 - actually choose so for let's go back
06:50 - so node.js is actually the javascript
06:52 - backend runtime
06:53 - and for that the best framework to
06:56 - choose
06:56 - is express now for java it is spring
07:00 - for ruby it is ruby on rails
07:03 - for python it is django or flask
07:07 - all right so this is just an image
07:10 - uh yeah this is like a visual expression
07:14 - and
07:14 - of course we got a php with laravel
07:17 - awesome let's take a step uh step ahead
07:21 - we got git and github we have videos
07:24 - coming up
07:25 - explaining what's the difference between
07:28 - the two
07:30 - uh but we also have a git 101
07:34 - already on this uh channel by amanov and
07:37 - me
07:38 - myself so let's actually take a look at
07:40 - what what's that two
07:42 - things so get is
07:45 - actually like doctor strange from the
07:48 - marwell
07:49 - world um this is like a time machine
07:53 - for programmers this is actually a tool
07:56 - that helps you guys to become better
07:58 - developers in faster times and
08:00 - you can just easily this is a great tool
08:02 - for developers all right
08:04 - so what's the difference between the two
08:06 - so github
08:08 - is actually up on the cloud
08:11 - git is on your local machine so
08:14 - you're tracking version on your machine
08:16 - and then you upload it to github
08:19 - well how does it look like all right so
08:21 - you get the master branch
08:23 - uh which might sound
08:26 - uh confusing at first but basically
08:29 - that's the version of the application
08:31 - actually right now it is called main
08:33 - so that's the branch that is actually on
08:36 - production which is
08:37 - uh released now you are branching out
08:40 - and you're
08:40 - building a big feature or smaller
08:43 - features
08:44 - and those are like separate branches so
08:46 - in case you have a bug
08:48 - it's not it's not going out to
08:50 - production all right and once you have a
08:52 - stable working
08:54 - awesome feature to your application you
08:57 - do this
08:58 - which is called the get merge
09:02 - and looks something like that alright
09:07 - next up let's talk databases and
09:10 - data so there are two main types of
09:14 - databases
09:15 - the first one is sql
09:18 - and the one of the most uh popular
09:21 - sql databases is postgresql and then we
09:25 - got oracle we got my sequel
09:28 - this is an awesome let's take a look at
09:31 - uh nosql databases
09:33 - the most popular is actually mongodb
09:36 - now let's take a look at what's the
09:37 - difference so a sql database is actually
09:40 - relational and in no sql database there
09:43 - is
09:44 - no relation between values you can
09:47 - store graphs in a document column all
09:50 - that stuff so nosql
09:51 - has less rules and for that it has a
09:54 - couple of advantages and disadvantages
09:57 - compared to sql now this is a couple of
10:00 - uses
10:00 - of nosql and sql database system for
10:04 - nosql is awesome for gaming social media
10:06 - iot
10:07 - web enterprise all that stuff
10:10 - now sql is actually
10:14 - awesome for data mart's enterprise again
10:17 - mobile web and all that crazy stuff so
10:20 - actually let's take a look at
10:21 - what nosql database is
10:25 - so it's a highly scalable highly
10:27 - available
10:28 - very very fast easily
10:32 - replicatable and big data capable
10:35 - uh database now we got a ton
10:39 - of tutorials how to use mongodb
10:42 - on this channel so make sure that you go
10:45 - ahead
10:46 - and check out those if you haven't done
10:48 - that already and
10:51 - actually this is my this is my instagram
10:54 - handle go ahead drop me a message if
10:56 - there is something
10:57 - that you need further details on but
11:00 - with that said let's go further now we
11:03 - got
11:03 - firebase what is firebase and why is it
11:06 - so useful as a back-end developer
11:09 - let's take a look at that so first up
11:13 - uh you can operate firebase super super
11:16 - easily
11:16 - with javascript all right now we got
11:19 - firebase hosting which allows you
11:22 - to host your application online in the
11:24 - ga
11:25 - they can they give you a preview link
11:28 - as well so it's super super easy
11:31 - we got cloud firestore which is actually
11:34 - a real-time database now why is it good
11:37 - super fast your application works
11:40 - without reloading and all that stuff
11:42 - super awesome make sure to check it out
11:45 - cloud firestore is amazing
11:47 - and and the guys over at google who
11:51 - actually own firebase
11:53 - they took the good parts of sql
11:56 - databases
11:57 - they took the good part of nosql
12:00 - databases they merged them
12:02 - and that's what firestore is it is a
12:05 - hybrid
12:05 - of sql and nosql databases this is super
12:09 - super
12:10 - awesome we got a ton of tutorial with
12:13 - that
12:13 - and we have a lot of stuff coming up we
12:16 - where we are using firebase firestore so
12:19 - make sure you hit that subscribe button
12:21 - because we got so much more awesomeness
12:23 - coming on this channel
12:25 - all right you can also authenticate
12:28 - users
12:29 - using firebase with a couple of lines of
12:32 - code
12:33 - because firebase is all about making
12:36 - developers live super easy
12:38 - it's actually think of it as like aws
12:42 - but with less pain in the head super
12:45 - easy to set up
12:46 - super easy to work with and you got the
12:48 - full
12:49 - google uh infrastructure behind your
12:52 - back
12:52 - and behind your applications back so
12:56 - this is this is so much so amazing you
12:58 - can also
13:00 - uh host node.js functions using firebase
13:04 - the cloud functions
13:05 - so you can actually build a server-less
13:09 - architecture using firebase now you also
13:12 - get storage for media
13:14 - and all that stuff that you want to go
13:16 - ahead and store
13:18 - in your application and you also get
13:21 - google analytics
13:22 - for firebase and you also get the
13:26 - firebase test lab
13:27 - so firebase is super super amazing and
13:31 - it should be the best friend
13:33 - of each and every single developer now
13:37 - what's the best part about firebase
13:40 - it is free for a super super generous
13:44 - limit
13:45 - now actually this video is not sponsored
13:48 - by
13:48 - firebase opportunity for firebase though
13:53 - this video is not sponsored by firebase
13:55 - by any means
13:56 - however because we want you guys to use
13:59 - the best
14:00 - of your time and to actually
14:04 - be successful as developers
14:07 - we highly highly recommend using
14:09 - firebase we use it
14:10 - in a ton of applications in our own team
14:13 - at clever programmer
14:15 - and we've built a ton of tutorials so
14:17 - make sure to check those out because
14:20 - that's how you actually see how powerful
14:23 - firebase
14:24 - is and you can also go ahead check out
14:25 - the pricing uh
14:27 - they are super generous with all that
14:29 - and boom
14:31 - easy as that all right let's talk
14:35 - node.js apis javascript
14:39 - so let's actually talk apis so first up
14:42 - let's take a look at this uh thing and i
14:45 - might
14:46 - and i might move myself let's stay here
14:49 - so
14:50 - what is an api first an api
14:54 - let's actually go ahead and go this way
14:58 - so if uh you the user you wanna know
15:01 - what's the weather like in los angeles
15:04 - now
15:06 - you go to somewhere some
15:09 - weather sort of website and you're
15:13 - actually
15:13 - interested in the weather so you that
15:16 - that is your input
15:17 - that way you actually express your
15:19 - interest in the weather
15:21 - now that website goes ahead and makes an
15:23 - api call to the backend also known as
15:26 - the server now
15:31 - the server goes ahead and starts
15:33 - calculating
15:34 - and all that stuff and looks into the
15:36 - database and
15:38 - super awesome stuff but then responds to
15:41 - the front end
15:42 - and tells you that it is 51 degrees
15:45 - right now
15:46 - might be not accurate at the moment when
15:48 - you're watching this but
15:50 - at that moment it was 51 degrees now
15:54 - the front end actually outputs it like
15:57 - shows it on the screen so basically this
16:00 - is a workflow of the api so this is the
16:03 - communication
16:04 - channel between the front end
16:07 - and the back end nas frankie and daniel
16:11 - from cover programmer made an awesome
16:14 - video explaining
16:15 - how the whole backhand uh how the whole
16:18 - api infrastructure works
16:20 - so make sure to check that out too it is
16:23 - a couple minute long video but it makes
16:25 - so much sense and explains super awesome
16:29 - all right next up let's take a look at
16:32 - this
16:32 - uh image as well this is another
16:35 - representation of how an api works
16:37 - basically the application makes a
16:39 - request to the back end
16:41 - and the channel that they use to
16:43 - communicate is the api it's kind of like
16:46 - you go into the restaurant make an order
16:48 - then
16:49 - the waiter is actually the api who takes
16:52 - the order to the kitchen
16:53 - brings back the pizza for you and
16:55 - delivers it to your table
16:58 - we also have graphql databases but
17:01 - in this tutorial we are not going to
17:03 - dive deep into that
17:05 - now let's talk devops mind-blowing
17:09 - so what is devops it's basically
17:11 - planning building continuous integration
17:12 - deployment
17:13 - operation continuous feedback there is a
17:16 - ton
17:16 - i mean a ton of applications
17:20 - and tools that you can use to maximize
17:23 - your devops
17:24 - now let's take a look at what what is
17:26 - this continuous integration
17:28 - uh which is the main part of devops
17:32 - it's basically your code you're coding
17:35 - you're testing you're analyzing your
17:36 - code you're
17:37 - tracking the version and you release all
17:39 - the time
17:40 - so basically it is a continuous flow
17:42 - when you're making new stuff
17:44 - making new features and you're always
17:46 - hitting that deploy and host button
17:49 - so super awesome thing make sure to
17:52 - check those out and go into details but
17:54 - we will have
17:55 - more and more um tutorials on how to
17:59 - understand
18:00 - all this stuff and how to use all these
18:02 - technologies
18:04 - now one of the most uh requested
18:07 - and and most useful uh application when
18:11 - it comes to devops and
18:13 - maintenance and all that stuff is docker
18:16 - now docker has a ton of use a ton of
18:20 - ways you can actually utilize it
18:22 - i'm going to show you guys one of them
18:25 - so
18:26 - let's actually go ahead and imagine that
18:29 - you want to deploy a react version 16
18:32 - application
18:33 - a react version 17 application a
18:36 - node.js which uses uh
18:40 - yeah node.js which uses the 12th version
18:44 - of node and you want to actually uh
18:46 - deploy a
18:48 - python uh version 3.9 application and a
18:52 - perfect
18:53 - which is the backend side of swift now
18:55 - you want to
18:57 - install all these on one server because
19:00 - buying a new server is super expensive
19:03 - provisioning a new one
19:04 - so much hassle you have only one server
19:07 - you want to deploy
19:08 - all these now we all know that
19:11 - all these applications has have a ton of
19:14 - dependencies
19:16 - if you don't know what i'm talking about
19:18 - um
19:19 - node modules that's all the dependencies
19:22 - su
19:23 - so much stuff and if you install
19:26 - all them on one server all the
19:28 - dependencies will be like oh my god
19:30 - now this is mainly because we got react
19:33 - 16
19:34 - version and react 17th version and it
19:37 - will just
19:38 - mess up the whole thing because if
19:41 - even if the others will be okay next to
19:44 - each other
19:45 - these two will definitely conflict and
19:47 - cause something like
19:48 - that on the server
19:51 - now for that docker introduced the
19:55 - containerized
19:56 - environment which means it creates
19:59 - separate environments for
20:01 - all the applications without running a
20:04 - virtual machine
20:05 - so how do how does it look like you have
20:08 - one server
20:09 - but then you have several little bits
20:12 - and pieces which are
20:13 - full applications look at it that way
20:17 - that's all for docker you probably won't
20:20 - need it
20:21 - too much but in case you do
20:24 - this is a go-to understanding of how you
20:27 - can
20:28 - actually use this now
20:31 - let's take a look at the top hosting
20:34 - platforms
20:35 - first up we got netlify it is free to
20:38 - use
20:38 - for some extent but this is an awesome
20:42 - tool
20:42 - to host your application react
20:44 - applications all that websites
20:47 - you also have firebase hosting which is
20:49 - just a couple of commands
20:51 - on the terminal it's so worth it and it
20:54 - is
20:54 - free for a super generous extent
20:58 - and we also have aws which is very very
21:02 - heavy and this is for like super pro
21:05 - users but aws is awesome we are not
21:08 - against it but
21:10 - we always suggest here at clever
21:12 - programming that try to use
21:13 - firebase as much as you can and if
21:16 - firebase is not enough
21:18 - then move to aws because firebase is so
21:20 - much easier to set up
21:22 - so much easier to work with and maintain
21:24 - now how can
21:26 - where can you actually learn all this
21:27 - stuff you can go ahead and search it up
21:30 - on youtube
21:31 - youtube and youtube you can also
21:34 - join discord servers go ahead join
21:37 - facebook groups
21:38 - linkedin whatever basically join a
21:42 - community
21:43 - but most recommended youtube they show
21:46 - you
21:47 - they actually talk during the videos
