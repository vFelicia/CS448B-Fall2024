01:24 - built and we're going to build this in a
01:25 - few
01:26 - different parts this is go ahead right
01:27 - here is part one but we'll be building
01:29 - basically the logic
01:31 - right here the logic for the view you
01:33 - can see this logic for the view
01:35 - today we're going to be building the
01:36 - view then part two we're gonna be
01:37 - building more complicated things like
01:39 - for example
01:40 - you've been able to click on the email
01:42 - and actually send an email if you want
01:43 - to right
01:44 - to go to click on start snooze sent and
01:47 - to be able to
01:47 - be actually to be able to see the
01:49 - different types of emails right
01:51 - it's going to be a humongous project
01:53 - we're going to have a lot of fun with it
01:55 - so get your butt strapped get ready
01:58 - because this is how we're going to do
01:59 - am i right hey exactly
02:03 - by the time we finish up why do i hear
02:06 - myself
02:08 - okay cool guys so okay this is the gmail
02:11 - clone just so you guys know right here
02:12 - let me see it's a gmail clone right here
02:15 - the you be
02:15 - uh let me see let me see let me tune
02:18 - this down for you
02:20 - this is the gmail that we are currently
02:22 - have
02:23 - like you see for example it's david he
02:24 - just sent me an email this is gmail on
02:26 - the wheel we're building by the way
02:27 - you're good can you hear me yes
02:29 - i can yes okay good good just making
02:31 - sure that everything is all right
02:34 - all right guys so let's get this day
02:36 - started okay first things first that you
02:37 - need to go ahead and do is very simple
02:39 - as you know in any time when you do
02:42 - when you start a project what we need to
02:44 - do of course is going to be what david
02:48 - so step number one obviously is setting
02:50 - up a react.js
02:52 - app and you can do that by just uh
02:54 - creating a new folder and typing in
02:56 - whatever nas is typing on the screen so
02:58 - npx create dash react dash app
03:02 - and gmail clone exactly so that will
03:05 - pretty much go ahead spin up a brand new
03:07 - react app for you
03:08 - a template react app with the usual blue
03:11 - background that nice little
03:13 - react logo in the center going around so
03:17 - that's amazing okay awesome sweet sweet
03:19 - so this is what you want to do so mpxg
03:21 - react app gmail.com that's your first
03:23 - step that you want to go ahead and get
03:24 - started with
03:25 - right open up terminal of course that's
03:27 - the goal here now once you've done that
03:29 - let me actually i mean i can basically
03:31 - just do it with you
03:32 - but we've already done it for with you
03:34 - we've already done it basically
03:35 - so let's say i have a terminal right
03:37 - here let me go ahead and clear this part
03:38 - out
03:39 - i only do you simply for example let me
03:40 - go ahead and zoom in here so you can see
03:42 - my cell you can see how it's better
03:43 - right there so we'll see for example npx
03:46 - right mpx create
03:48 - dash react dash app right and then you
03:51 - say gmail clone right there
03:52 - so that's what you want to say exactly
03:54 - now granted you are there's some things
03:55 - you need to do you need to have
03:57 - things like for example you need to have
03:59 - things like npm installed no that's
04:01 - really important so i mean npm node.js
04:03 - right here you need to have all those
04:05 - installed does that make sense
04:07 - yes yes yes 100 okay
04:10 - i'm just looking at the comments okay
04:13 - everything
04:14 - is up and running amazing guys so we
04:16 - have a lot of people coming in
04:18 - guys smash that like button
04:21 - that is the number one way you can
04:24 - get started as a developer no other
04:26 - youtubers does it like you guys do thank
04:28 - you so much
04:29 - appreciate all your amazing comments
04:31 - guys you guys are always
04:32 - the best as you know as you know
04:36 - okay beautiful cool so let me actually
04:39 - see if i can see the column can i see
04:41 - the comments and you actually in here
04:42 - let me see
04:43 - uh yes oh i'm seeing the comments oh
04:45 - look at this i see the comments
04:46 - yo oh i can't even put them on here
04:48 - superb let's go
04:50 - amazing clever programmer thank you so
04:52 - much you are superb that's awesome
04:54 - that's awesome so
04:55 - i'm always happy happy happy to hear
04:57 - that okay let me go ahead hi
04:59 - somebody said hi hi what's up hey what's
05:02 - up how are you doing i hope you're doing
05:03 - great
05:04 - all right so uh really simple as in that
05:06 - case let's get into it so we said npx
05:08 - create tab that's gonna be your first
05:10 - step and as you see right here we've
05:12 - already done this and we have our
05:13 - project right here right we have our
05:15 - project right here
05:16 - that yeah right here so let's go ahead
05:19 - and
05:19 - close this up and this project contains
05:22 - a few different things
05:23 - contains an app.js file contains over
05:25 - index.js file this for instags file is
05:27 - our
05:28 - starter file right here guys right
05:30 - that's our starter file
05:32 - so just remember that this starter file
05:34 - is
05:35 - basically where we blind our app this is
05:38 - called the binder app
05:39 - right here this app do something called
05:41 - the root now the root right here is when
05:43 - you go to app.js look at this actually
05:44 - when you go to let me see
05:46 - let me see when you go to public and you
05:47 - go to instahtml you see how it says div
05:50 - id
05:50 - root so any html is actually the html
05:53 - file that
05:54 - your browser your browser watches
05:57 - right your browser is the what loads the
05:59 - html file but when you go to dvd root
06:01 - you see this is wd root
06:03 - what happens then is the inside js we
06:06 - have something called get
06:07 - element by id as you might know that is
06:09 - by at this point it will actually get
06:11 - the element
06:12 - and then react binds that element that
06:16 - div to the actual react app that's how
06:19 - it works like
06:20 - how cool is that huh i think that's
06:23 - pretty damn cool right
06:25 - i didn't actually know that you didn't
06:27 - know that
06:28 - yeah i mean i was just doing all these
06:30 - react stuff yeah yeah yeah well there
06:32 - you go for those of you who don't know
06:33 - that
06:34 - is this is this is how react kind of
06:36 - works right it binds it through
06:37 - through here and of course we have jsx
06:40 - to actually make
06:41 - stuff a lot easier for us now what we
06:43 - have here this is our app.js file if we
06:45 - go ahead and actually
06:46 - let me go ahead and open up the terminal
06:48 - i will go right click open integrate and
06:50 - integrate terminal
06:51 - inside this terminal a few things going
06:53 - to happen i'm going to say i'm going to
06:54 - say
06:55 - npm no npm npm start
06:58 - right that's what i'm going to say
07:00 - pmstart that should start our
07:02 - application for us
07:03 - uh would you like to you running up
07:05 - another port i will say yes
07:07 - you most likely will not have that that
07:09 - option or that issue but
07:11 - just keep that in mind cool and we have

09:12 - all right so we did npm start to go
09:15 - ahead and start our project and what is
09:16 - the next thing that we should be doing
09:18 - uh david what do you think
09:21 - so right now we should be going ahead
09:24 - and just
09:24 - pretty much cleaning up the whole
09:26 - application and
09:28 - i'll just get started with that what do
09:30 - you say okay let's get started so let's
09:31 - go and clean out this application
09:32 - exactly
09:33 - okay you can see david here here pretty
09:34 - much yeah go ahead he's going to go
09:36 - ahead and
09:37 - move the header and all this other stuff
09:39 - which is the boilerplate
09:40 - which is we don't need that right now
09:42 - right so right exactly
09:44 - exactly we don't need any of those stuff
09:46 - uh that's
09:48 - pretty much just for the uh template app
09:51 - that you can see on the left hand side
09:53 - and right now because i saved it
09:54 - it's now gone and the whole thing is
09:56 - completely white
09:58 - exactly and now next up what we can do
10:01 - is we can go into
10:02 - the file explorer uh if you can open it
10:05 - up right there
10:06 - yeah yes and there are a few test files
10:09 - so
10:09 - number one is app.test.js we can pretty
10:12 - much go ahead and just get rid of that
10:14 - as well as logo.svg okay and
10:18 - setup tests.js we don't need any of
10:22 - these files
10:23 - for this project so basically bye bye
10:25 - all these files bye-bye bye-bye adios
10:28 - baby
10:28 - okay anyways bye-bye
10:38 - i was speaking czech here bro anyways
10:41 - guys so cool so we got that we deleted
10:42 - all the files
10:43 - now let's go ahead and get started and
10:45 - build our first component right now
10:46 - we're still
10:47 - not done with the cleanup process by the
10:49 - way no
10:51 - no because we nee uh okay
10:55 - go into app.css okay and delete
10:58 - everything
10:58 - in there okay so let's go ahead and go
11:00 - to app.css okay go ahead
11:02 - yep boom oh just like that delete
11:05 - everything okay
11:06 - one thing we do is we like to do add
11:07 - margin zero for everything so we should
11:09 - like to say
11:09 - something something like this we'll say
11:12 - margin
11:13 - well this is not margin
11:16 - mark come on i hate it when they're just
11:20 - kind of like
11:20 - margin right there zero
11:24 - boom boom boom awesome sweet so that
11:26 - kind of removes the margin and
11:27 - everything because
11:28 - things like headers things like p tags
11:30 - things all those
11:31 - they have margin guys okay and so we try
11:33 - to remove them for that purpose okay
11:35 - awesome so we save that save everything
11:37 - say everything we have cool we have
11:38 - app.css
11:39 - and look at that he is already running
11:42 - uh he's already typing up clever program
11:43 - right here
11:44 - and you can see if i save my app.js file
11:46 - we should see clever programmer on here
11:48 - but we technically don't see the cloud
11:49 - pokemon here there's a reason why we
11:50 - don't see cloud pokemon here
11:52 - i mean sometimes you need to refresh the
11:54 - whole thing okay
11:56 - there we go
12:01 - and cool so all right so the first thing
12:04 - we need to build is what do you think
12:05 - guys the first thing
12:06 - to do of course when we go ahead and
12:08 - create any project we need to think
12:09 - about a few different things and one
12:11 - thing one really important thing being
12:13 - actually just how it's structured right
12:15 - so if we look at our for example
12:17 - application a few things
12:19 - happens here if you think about the
12:20 - structure of our app right
12:22 - we have things for example like the
12:23 - header right here right this is the
12:25 - header okay
12:26 - okay let me go ahead and freeze this
12:28 - this right here is the header right
12:29 - there
12:30 - that's the header okay so so we need to
12:32 - build the header
12:33 - after that what do we have we have
12:34 - things like a sidebar you see the
12:36 - sidebar right here that's a sidebar
12:37 - right here correct
12:39 - right then we have something called what
12:41 - is this what is this called
12:42 - this is i think what is like emails
12:44 - think about is just email container
12:46 - right can we think of it like that
12:47 - yeah yeah i called it emails view yeah
12:50 - so an email container exactly
12:52 - so that's what we're going to do all
12:53 - right next we have what what is this
12:55 - called
12:56 - what should we call this uh david i mean
12:59 - i think the easiest way to call it is
13:00 - just side icons
13:02 - basically just a few icons that take
13:12 - oh we got 20 donation let's go
13:15 - yo whoo um that's just what 20 euros i'm
13:18 - not sure what that is
13:19 - 20 something super chat i'm chesh i'm
13:22 - 20 cents 20 cents okay thank you so much
13:25 - you said 20
13:25 - indian rupees thank you so much bro i
13:28 - appreciate it we really appreciate it
13:29 - yeah of course
13:30 - awesome sweet so cool all right let's
13:32 - get this party started right away
13:34 - uh so we know we figured that part out
13:36 - okay that's really really important
13:38 - next thing of course as we go into more
13:39 - components we have components for
13:40 - example like
13:41 - a logo component right we have things
13:43 - like an input component right we have
13:45 - things like the icons component where
13:47 - all of our icons your gear icon will
13:49 - always be used right
13:50 - that's really important and of course we
13:52 - have individual email components
13:54 - now why are we specifically talking
13:56 - about those that's a good question
13:57 - right it's because when you divide when
13:59 - you build projects in
14:01 - react you want to split them up into
14:03 - components right into small little
14:06 - sections
14:06 - right that's always the goal of of
14:10 - react.js components components
14:12 - components components components
14:13 - just think about like that okay you
14:14 - build components with components exactly
14:16 - you build components with components so
14:18 - that's always the goal right so let's go
14:19 - ahead and keep this
14:20 - going right here all right so we got
14:22 - this component the first component here
14:24 - we're going to work on today is which
14:25 - component david
14:27 - we are going to be first building the
14:29 - header exactly so we're building the
14:31 - header component which is this one right
14:33 - here so
14:33 - you can see i'm kind of clicking through
14:35 - it that's going to be the component
14:36 - we'll build
14:37 - right now all right in that case let's
14:39 - just go straight
14:40 - into it to build a header component what
14:42 - we need to do is actually create a
14:44 - header component that kind of looks like
14:45 - this so we'll say header
14:47 - not like this we'll say header boom and
14:50 - we'll close it out right we'll close it
14:51 - out now of course this means it had a
14:53 - component right here but
14:55 - just because we added this does not mean
14:56 - that it's there because what we need to
14:58 - do is we need to go down
14:59 - back to our source file source folder
15:02 - and we need to create a new file called
15:04 - header
15:05 - dot gs okay this is going to be our
15:08 - header component
15:09 - now inside the js there's a we need to
15:12 - create a function now component okay
15:14 - that's what we now need to do so to
15:17 - create a function component what are we
15:18 - going to use
15:20 - we're just going to use the extension
15:21 - and just type in r afc
15:23 - exactly it's what is the accession
15:26 - called by the way
15:27 - anybody knows uh es7 react redux
15:30 - yeah graphql yeah yes es7 it's it's a
15:33 - yeah just just you can sort it out if
15:36 - you if you search up es7
15:38 - snippets or maybe you add react as well
15:41 - yeah uh it's gonna do it yeah and you
15:44 - can just type in r
15:45 - a fc because that that way it will
15:47 - create an arrow function
15:48 - exactly so now now if you do rfce by the
15:51 - way we have 369 viewers
15:53 - let's go you guys are epic let's also
15:57 - like this
15:57 - the video just to help us out much
15:59 - really appreciate it like this video
16:01 - subscribe for videos like this guys of
16:03 - course but like
16:04 - like like that way you know that way
16:06 - gets out to more viewers and that way
16:07 - you know we defeat this youtube
16:08 - algorithm which is so mean to us
16:10 - sometimes
16:10 - but it's okay we still live with it we
16:12 - love you at youtube sometimes
16:14 - sometimes sometimes sometimes not
16:17 - cool so you can type into something like
16:19 - rfce
16:20 - right here yep and that will actually
16:22 - create the component for you right there
16:24 - see now this is
16:24 - this is what we have so now we have our
16:26 - header component okay cool
16:28 - all right so now let me let me do a
16:30 - little bit of organizat organizing in uh
16:32 - in the folders section just because make
16:35 - sure everything is at its place go ahead
16:38 - so nas just threw in the header.js
16:41 - which is amazing but uh i kind of like
16:44 - things
16:44 - uh kept tidy okay so let's go ahead and
16:47 - have a folder for components
16:49 - right and everything that is actually
16:52 - going to be
16:53 - a layout component like a whole
16:57 - something i like to have them a separate
17:00 - folder okay so i'll create a layout
17:02 - folder inside of components so right
17:04 - here this is the connections folder guys
17:06 - and then inside the components folder
17:07 - you will create
17:08 - a layout folder right here you see a
17:10 - layout right there
17:11 - right there right there and then what i
17:13 - would just do is pretty much just drag
17:14 - and drop
17:15 - the header into uh into layout
17:19 - and that will pretty much do its thing
17:21 - and now my file is there
17:22 - there we go so now the components is
17:24 - inside layout i'm not sure why it shows
17:26 - us like uh the way it shows it's so
17:28 - weird sometimes
17:29 - because we don't have any other folder
17:32 - in there but
17:33 - we will actually create it and then it
17:35 - will it will show normally just now that
17:37 - it's inside the layouts
17:38 - folder okay that's the only thing you
17:40 - have to understand okay exactly so how
17:42 - do that js and again we do this for
17:43 - cleanliness purposes for cleanliness
17:45 - purposes that's always the goal here
17:47 - okay
17:47 - okay all right so let's go ahead and i'm
17:50 - just gonna just
17:50 - command a command c for some reason that
17:53 - one got deleted so
17:54 - command v and this is our header
17:55 - component beautiful so let's go ahead
17:57 - and save this one cool
17:58 - so you can see now this is the header
17:59 - component that's in here and if we go to
18:01 - our react app
18:02 - it says headers not defined now why is
18:03 - that the case because if we go now
18:05 - to app.js you can see right there right
18:08 - we need to
18:08 - import our header that's the first thing
18:10 - we need to do so let's go and import our
18:11 - header so we can say
18:12 - import import header
18:16 - from where let me go ahead and remove
18:18 - this from what's like
18:22 - yeah it's a components folder and inside
18:24 - a layout
18:25 - and then you just slash what you see
18:27 - header right there
18:29 - this will actually import our header
18:30 - component this is how we use the
18:32 - you do that in react.js okay look at
18:34 - that now it's so good
18:36 - so that way if i go to header.js right
18:37 - here if i type in something like for
18:39 - example h1
18:40 - cp right if i save that right now you
18:43 - see cp right there right
18:45 - cp right there that's how that works
18:47 - okay let's go back to our header gs
18:49 - uh app.js so now that way this now
18:52 - this way we can now work in very simple
18:54 - parallels we can now focus on specific
18:56 - components
18:57 - and work directly with them without
18:59 - having to try to look at the big picture
19:01 - too much right
19:02 - that's the cool part next up in the
19:04 - inside inside the components let's
19:05 - create a query header.css just to make
19:08 - sure we have css file correct
19:09 - actually no we can we don't need to do
19:10 - ahead of that css we are not doing
19:12 - header css because
19:14 - we are doing something fresh
19:17 - let's go we're going to install
19:18 - components which is we don't need a css
19:20 - file
19:21 - now exactly you might be confused but
19:23 - trust me you're gonna be so happy when
19:25 - you see this
19:25 - trust me so okay all right what is the
19:28 - first time we need to create david tell
19:30 - me
19:31 - so step number one you just want to go
19:34 - ahead and install style components
19:36 - yes yes let's go ahead and component
19:38 - that's step number one so let's go ahead
19:39 - and do this we're going to open up a new
19:41 - terminal here
19:42 - okay and we'll do npm install
19:46 - correct install and what are the styles
19:48 - is the style dash components
19:51 - i think so styled components
19:55 - yeah i think it's styled components yeah
19:57 - style yeah
19:58 - style dash components and what it will
20:00 - do guys is
20:01 - pretty much you can define the css
20:04 - inside of the javascript file which will
20:07 - make your code
20:08 - a lot more but i mean it's going to be
20:12 - confusing
20:12 - at the very beginning but once you get a
20:14 - hold of it it's going to be
20:16 - amazing because you can literally forget
20:18 - about all the html
20:20 - tags and you can create your own
20:24 - tags exactly that's going to be epic
20:26 - exactly it's going to be
20:27 - really really really really really
20:29 - really really really happy
20:31 - trust me something i've seen before
20:33 - we're going to write css in javascript
20:35 - how cool is that right so that's going
20:36 - to be the really cool part
20:37 - cool so awesome so we didn't and let's
20:40 - go now we need to go ahead and now
20:42 - import style couples right so how do we
20:44 - do that
20:45 - so you just want to say import styled
20:48 - from styled components
20:49 - and that's going to do it and we see
20:52 - something like styled
20:54 - components right there okay dish
20:55 - components yes cool so now we're in the
20:58 - in the hap
20:59 - now we are inside inside our
21:03 - header inside our the first thing we're
21:04 - going to create is we're going to create
21:06 - a wrapper right here you see that guys a
21:07 - wrapper
21:08 - and the wrapper is just going to wrap
21:09 - the whole header component right
21:12 - when we create the wrapper we're going
21:13 - to now you can see that the way he did
21:15 - is
21:15 - almost like a component right but it's
21:18 - going to be a style component and the
21:19 - way we do that is we simply go to const
21:21 - wrapper right there down below okay
21:23 - and then we'll and then we say style.div
21:26 - so instead of
21:27 - instead of basically doing div and then
21:28 - putting a class on it
21:30 - okay what we do with that is we do we
21:33 - create
21:33 - a wrapper almost like components right
21:36 - style component inside
21:37 - our gs file right here and then we say
21:40 - that it's a div so if we take a look at
21:41 - this now
21:42 - so if i save this right let's go save
21:44 - this you see nothing is in here
21:46 - but what i can do for example is i can
21:47 - say for example let's just let's just
21:49 - have an example i'll say
21:50 - here background background look at this
21:54 - color color and i will say for example
21:57 - here
21:58 - background color and i will say orange
22:00 - because why not
22:01 - okay all right see right there i just
22:04 - have background color orange now i can
22:05 - give it a height let's say height height
22:08 - of let's say
22:08 - 200 pixels like how sick is that like
22:12 - that is so sick honestly for us to be
22:14 - able to see
22:16 - all of this just like that so easily
22:19 - so easily it's insane and then i don't
22:21 - have to do a css file no nothing
22:23 - so let's go ahead we don't need this of
22:24 - course we don't need what do we need for
22:27 - for in this case let's actually go
22:30 - through the
22:31 - whole structure of the header because
22:33 - then it will start to make sense why we
22:35 - do what we do
22:36 - okay so the structure of the header that
22:38 - we're going to create of course is
22:39 - initially going to be the logo
22:41 - wrapper right there so it's going to be
22:42 - a local wrapper that's going to contain
22:44 - our icon right here
22:45 - and the gmail logo so you can see here
22:49 - what dave is doing is he creating a logo
22:51 - wrapper right there okay
22:52 - and then inside here he's going to
22:54 - create first he's going to create
22:56 - the this icon that we call the hamburger
22:58 - menu
22:59 - okay and then we're going to create
23:01 - after that a
23:03 - added simply an image of our gmail logo
23:05 - right
23:06 - there right there okay what kind of
23:09 - exactly
23:10 - there we go beautiful so he's done it
23:12 - right here div there's gonna be a menu
23:13 - icon and then image source is gonna be
23:15 - right here
23:16 - now yeah the menu icon is gonna be
23:18 - imported from
23:19 - material ui so we will just wait for
23:22 - that
23:22 - a little uh but by the way
23:26 - i will actually drop a link for uh in
23:28 - the chat and that's going to be
23:30 - the source of the uh what's that
23:34 - the logo there's the logo awesome thanks
23:36 - thanks thanks yeah i'm just gonna
23:37 - drop it in the chat so you guys can and
23:40 - if you can copy and go with it if you
23:41 - can't find it just go to like gmail
23:43 - type in gmail logo into you know into
23:46 - you know
23:46 - and that's pretty much just do images
23:48 - you know local you can just copy
23:49 - something like this for example okay
23:50 - that's a gmail logo right yeah
23:52 - i i think that's exactly the one yeah
23:54 - it's pretty much the one so don't worry
23:55 - so much about that okay
23:56 - awesome all right cool we got that let's
23:58 - go ahead and install our menu icon
24:00 - actually can we do that let's install a
24:01 - menu icon uh yeah we can we can totally
24:03 - do that
24:04 - so okay again we're going to use
24:05 - material ui icons material
24:07 - ui icons right there okay
24:11 - icons right there that's okay material
24:14 - icons
24:14 - right there cool uh to install
24:17 - materiality of course you need to
24:18 - install material ui icons
24:20 - and you need to install materialize as a
24:22 - package correct yes or no
24:23 - yeah you need to install the core and
24:26 - then you can install the icon
24:27 - let's store the core to install the core
24:29 - as you can see here i go to material ui
24:31 - right there to install the core all i
24:33 - simply say is i simply say like this npm
24:35 - install
24:35 - right there material ui core so let's go
24:38 - ahead and do that
24:39 - ah that's not what i want let's go to go
24:42 - ahead and go command
24:43 - v into our terminal and we say enter npm
24:45 - install material ui core
24:47 - that's going to be the first part all
24:48 - right installing that installing that
24:50 - you can see
24:51 - hopefully you can see the bottom portion
24:53 - i know we've kind of run the right hand
24:54 - side portion
24:55 - all right then what we have let me go
24:57 - ahead and put this on the left hand side
24:58 - so we can see us better right there you
25:00 - can pretty much just hit an
25:02 - up arrow and then delete core
25:05 - and then type in icons and now we're
25:06 - saying icons right there
25:08 - yeah it just makes things super easy
25:11 - nice okay
25:11 - install that that's gonna be sick all
25:13 - right i love this song it's so good
25:18 - [Music]
25:20 - beautiful so we got that portion all
25:22 - figured out
25:23 - let's go ahead and actually import our
25:25 - icon that we need to use and the
25:27 - aka that we're going to be using if we
25:28 - go and search up for let's say
25:30 - material material ui
25:34 - icons yeah actually this time what we
25:38 - will use here
25:40 - is going to be the menu icon i can just
25:43 - pretty much go ahead and drop it over
25:44 - there yes if i search up menu right
25:46 - there
25:47 - yeah this is this is where see it says
25:49 - menu if i click on this one
25:50 - it tells right there import menu icon
25:52 - from until ui your icons
25:54 - and that's exactly what we're going to
25:56 - do here so let's go ahead and do that
25:57 - right now
25:58 - right there beautiful okay and now we
26:01 - can just say
26:02 - menu icon and then close it
26:05 - and we will be good that's it pretty
26:06 - much you can see right there boom right
26:08 - there
26:08 - done
26:14 - let's check out how the application
26:15 - let's see how it looks like okay
26:17 - it says local wrappers how to find it
26:19 - yeah because yes that's actually the
26:21 - thing with
26:22 - styled components you need to uh pretty
26:25 - much define
26:26 - all these wrappers and custom tags
26:29 - always it's just something that you you
26:31 - shouldn't freak out if your app freaks
26:33 - out
26:34 - yeah uh it's probably because you forgot
26:36 - one of these pretty much
26:37 - every pretty much guys every single time
26:39 - that you go ahead and you have a div
26:41 - you're going to create a style component
26:43 - for it does that make sense makes sense
26:44 - yes
26:46 - exactly okay yes so we got that let's go
26:48 - ahead and save that portion
26:50 - all right oh we get the gmail icon right
26:52 - there beautiful let's
26:54 - go awesome that's what's up nice what's
26:56 - an accent all right should we get the
26:57 - search so next up we will have yeah we
26:59 - will do the search wrapper
27:01 - and that would actually be a little uh
27:03 - crazy that will have a few different
27:05 - things in there
27:06 - so first we will have the search wrapper
27:09 - right right there and the one we're
27:10 - going to create is this wrapper right
27:11 - here so you see right this
27:12 - right here this uh this right here the
27:14 - cert the search input that's going to be
27:16 - the so we call it the search
27:18 - wrapper so can we think about this again
27:20 - right now inside of that
27:22 - uh go ahead we need to see that little
27:24 - green a gray thing
27:25 - that's going to be the search bar
27:28 - wrapper
27:28 - yes whoops yeah because the search
27:31 - wrappers is going to basically be just
27:32 - like a div that's like that's going to
27:34 - contain the inputs right there
27:36 - and then the input itself is just going
27:37 - to be this part right here right
27:40 - that's going to be exactly the search
27:41 - bar wrapper that you have right here
27:43 - yeah and then notice that up here on
27:46 - line 5 i just imported an other
27:48 - uh icon but from material ui icons where
27:51 - is that
27:52 - and that's great yeah icon beautiful
27:56 - okay yeah and that's going to be the
27:57 - search icon so that's going to be that
27:59 - little magnifying glass
28:01 - right there up top yep which is going to
28:03 - take you to here
28:04 - exactly see right there right there
28:06 - exactly awesome sweet sweet sweet cool
28:08 - so now comes a input tag
28:12 - which is going to have a text nope it's
28:14 - going to have a type
28:15 - of text nice nice and we'll have a
28:19 - placeholder
28:22 - of search mail right because that's what
28:24 - we have in
28:25 - in gmail right search mail
28:28 - and just close it and we will have one
28:31 - more
28:32 - uh which is going to be the x expand
28:35 - more
28:35 - icon i just put it down below uh
28:39 - search icon and there will be that
28:41 - little
28:42 - down looking arrow-ish
28:46 - oh the one you're talking about this one
28:47 - right here correct this one right here
28:48 - beautiful
28:49 - yeah so this is the one we're talking
28:50 - about so you can see we created three
28:51 - different components okay
28:52 - one component is going to be if we look
28:54 - at this right this is going to be the
28:56 - what this is going to be the um
28:58 - the search icon this is going to be the
29:00 - input
29:01 - and this is going to be the actual
29:03 - experiment icon you can see that how
29:05 - everything here is pretty much a
29:06 - component okay component component
29:07 - component component
29:08 - okay just keep that in your mind
29:09 - component component component right and
29:11 - just
29:12 - all it is is just boxes it's just
29:13 - rectangles that's all pretty much it
29:15 - right not a big deal at all
29:16 - cool all right next up so we cut those
29:18 - now do we need to create of course i'm
29:20 - guessing style components for them right
29:23 - uh yeah let's let's actually do that
29:25 - right now while we are at it
29:27 - so so let's go we wouldn't we would need
29:29 - to have a

32:19 - create a style deal so i'm going to say
32:21 - let me talk let me create this
32:24 - so i'm going to say damn it go icons
32:28 - wrapper
32:29 - wrapper is going to be equal to styled
32:32 - dot div guys style.diff right there
32:35 - beautiful okay
32:36 - so now go ahead and save this and if we
32:38 - go back to our react tab
32:39 - this is what we have you can see again
32:40 - it looks hideous definitely fine
32:42 - completely fine right oh we have another
32:44 - super chat thank you so much
32:46 - super chat uh let's not talk about that
32:49 - right
32:53 - you guys that's that's that's a
32:55 - different explanation so let's go ahead
32:57 - let's focus more so on what we're doing
32:59 - right now okay
33:00 - so thank you so much cool let's go ahead
33:02 - and keep going keep going keep going
33:04 - uh let's now go ahead and style these
33:06 - specific portions okay
33:08 - let's style this the specific portions
33:10 - so we have what we have the wrapper
33:12 - and what are we going to be using for
33:14 - this rapper just in general let's think
33:16 - about this huh
33:18 - uh so yeah that's actually uh another
33:20 - new
33:21 - thing on the channel like we're going
33:23 - hard on css today because
33:25 - we always use uh display flex but
33:28 - it's just outdated and not that cool
33:32 - so we will use display grid okay okay
33:35 - let's go ahead and try this
33:36 - display grid so inside the wrapper let's
33:38 - go ahead and do
33:39 - what display so go ahead you do it
33:42 - you're typing
33:43 - you're typing go type type type type
33:45 - type okay or type okay
33:47 - so we will just say uh display and
33:50 - instead of flags we will type in grid
33:52 - right and that's actually a new uh
33:55 - something you can pretty much go ahead
33:56 - and search up the documentation
33:58 - but you should think about it as a
34:00 - display flex row and a display flex
34:03 - column
34:03 - combined so it has the power of both of
34:07 - those
34:08 - and it's just uh super useful especially
34:10 - if you want to create
34:12 - a flexible website yeah you can see for
34:14 - example here this is the cool part about
34:16 - this is that
34:17 - i can do i can create these grids right
34:19 - here just by saying for example
34:21 - display grid and i can even do give it
34:23 - like row so for example
34:25 - hey i will have columns and and the
34:27 - first column is going to be 40 pixels
34:29 - if i zoom in here if i zoom in on here
34:32 - for example you can see here it says the
34:34 - the first columns will be 40 pixels
34:36 - then the second columns will be 50
34:37 - pixels then the middle cons will be auto
34:39 - right here
34:40 - and then third column is going to be 50
34:42 - and then back to 40. that's really cool
34:44 - part this stuff you can define is just
34:46 - simply by using css how
34:48 - insane is that i think so
34:51 - i think that's pretty insane okay all
34:53 - right
34:54 - beautiful let's go continue on oh yeah
34:58 - yeah uh so once we are cool with that
35:00 - okay we need to ensure
35:02 - that uh the
35:06 - how do you say that all these uh like we
35:09 - have those
35:10 - columns set up yeah in the instance
35:12 - let's think about this which comes we
35:13 - want to set up well
35:14 - we have here we have a few columns one
35:16 - is going to be this column
35:18 - yep right and that and we know that it's
35:21 - going to be like 270 pixels
35:23 - so there's three columns that we need to
35:25 - create and so to define those three
35:27 - columns is pretty simple if you look at
35:28 - our guide you see how it says
35:30 - grid template columns let's define them
35:32 - you can see here uh
35:33 - data's typing grid template columns
35:35 - right there which is exactly what we're
35:36 - typing right here right
35:38 - right there and we're going to define it
35:40 - 270 pixels auto 170. so what does this
35:42 - mean this means that
35:44 - this means this means that if we go
35:47 - ahead and refresh this
35:48 - let's go ahead and refresh this i'll
35:51 - save this
35:52 - right there this is a fusible you see by
35:54 - the way it right away went to its places
35:57 - right if i go to for example let me go
35:59 - uh well that's not what i want
36:01 - if i for example go to and i say arrow
36:04 - okay
36:04 - you can see here that 270 this is this
36:07 - is this one that's this
36:08 - uh right here column then the auto is
36:11 - going to be the auto so it's going to be
36:12 - changed depending on
36:13 - the size exactly it's like flex one it's
36:16 - going to change depending on size and
36:17 - then 170 pixels
36:18 - that's going to be this one okay make
36:20 - sense guys this is how the cool part
36:22 - about display
36:23 - grid with grid columns okay awesome
36:26 - let's go ahead and keep going
36:27 - david okay so
36:31 - once we are cool with that uh we want to
36:34 - actually add a little
36:35 - bottom uh border which is going to be
36:38 - one pixel
36:39 - solid and it's going to be light gray
36:41 - it's just a nice little touch that what
36:43 - the guys over at google did uh to gmail
36:46 - they have this
36:47 - uh bottom bottom border so we'll just go
36:50 - ahead and type in
36:52 - border bottom and it will be a one pixel
36:56 - solid and light gray yeah
36:59 - right there so let's go ahead boom
37:03 - cool so i don't want that so if we go
37:05 - now go to here you see now we have a
37:07 - very
37:08 - light light light uh border at the
37:10 - bottom here beautiful okay
37:11 - all coming together nice i like it i
37:14 - like it okay let's keep going keep going
37:16 - now we will give it a height of 70
37:18 - pixels
37:19 - right because again here hi we have also
37:21 - around 70 pixels right here
37:23 - beautiful right here awesome all right
37:25 - exactly
37:26 - nice and we want to align the items to
37:29 - center
37:30 - so that means uh vertically everything
37:33 - is going to be centered out and
37:34 - it's not going to have this uh roller
37:36 - coaster
37:37 - style exactly so you want to be
37:39 - basically we want to center a vertical
37:41 - center align everything right
37:42 - pretty simply okay let's go ahead and
37:44 - take a look at what david is doing here
37:45 - align item center beautiful and you can
37:47 - see now
37:48 - now it's not it's not still not as
37:50 - pretty as we want it to be so if we
37:52 - refresh this right still space we want
37:53 - it to be
37:54 - but that's completely fine because let's
37:56 - go right click inspect down but on this
37:57 - one
37:59 - exactly because the thing is like the
38:01 - logo just
38:02 - messes up the whole thing but we will
38:04 - fix it don't worry we'll fix everything
38:06 - right
38:07 - so let me make this larger
38:11 - it's larger okay cool so you can see now
38:13 - this is what we got now
38:14 - we have this specific you see now this
38:16 - is a grid you can see how it's outlined
38:18 - the grid
38:18 - right there this is the grid we have you
38:20 - can see this is going to be the logo
38:21 - wrapper
38:22 - then right here let me go ahead and move
38:23 - myself more to the middle maybe right
38:25 - here so you guys can see my our bet
38:27 - are better we have this specific portion
38:29 - logo wrapper then we have
38:31 - the watch the search wrapper and then of
38:33 - course everything else now the reason
38:34 - why it's at the bottom right now is
38:35 - because this
38:36 - thinking gmail icon is pushing
38:39 - everything to the bottom okay
38:40 - pushing up to the bottom so let's change
38:42 - that right i just want to add a little
38:44 - quick disclaimer if you are using safari
38:47 - it's not
38:47 - acting okay just don't worry about the
38:49 - safari okay
38:52 - nobody cares about safari
38:55 - gosh darn it david okay
38:58 - so uh next up we can we can get start
39:01 - like
39:02 - we are cool with the the overall wrapper
39:04 - styling
39:05 - now let's dive into the logo wrapper
39:08 - right yes yeah that part exactly so we
39:11 - will go
39:12 - deeper and deeper and let's just get
39:15 - started let's go so the logo wrapper
39:17 - will is going to have a height of 45
39:20 - pixels
39:21 - beautiful right okay obviously
39:24 - we are going to use display grid okay
39:28 - just for the sake of learning because
39:30 - it's so good uh
39:31 - yep and we will have a uh we will
39:34 - actually go ahead and define
39:36 - again the columns so it's going to be
39:38 - like
39:40 - we will have a grid template uh
39:44 - columns okay right because right now
39:46 - because right now it's pretty much in
39:47 - rows you can see here
39:48 - right this is in rows we have row one
39:50 - and row two
39:51 - so by given to put it into a column we
39:53 - can put it into
39:54 - columns you can see right there so let's
39:56 - just do that right now yeah
39:58 - okay so the first column is going to
40:01 - take
40:01 - up 25 of the
40:05 - width of the whole wrapper and the other
40:08 - one is going to use
40:09 - flex one so basically use up all the
40:12 - other space
40:13 - and this is yeah go on go ahead keep
40:16 - going keep going
40:17 - okay uh let's save and let's see if it
40:20 - fixes
40:21 - because uh we might need to add the
40:23 - other div
40:24 - so we don't have just so specifically
40:26 - you see this is still
40:27 - still still still because i think you
40:29 - you've misplaced good
40:30 - grid template columns you didn't say it
40:32 - right
40:34 - because you did not type it right right
40:35 - there template
40:41 - now of course the issue here is this gma
40:44 - clone is still way too large right we
40:45 - don't need that guys we don't want that
40:47 - so what we're going to do
40:48 - is we're going to wrap this image into a
40:50 - div just like
40:52 - david did here right here i'm going to
40:54 - wrap this image but we're going to wrap
40:55 - this image into a style component so i
40:57 - will say for example here let me write
40:58 - let me type this
40:59 - and i will say here logo i will say logo
41:02 - for example here right right there
41:04 - that's the logo okay beautiful
41:05 - so okay logan defined that's completely
41:07 - fine then i go here to the bottom and i
41:09 - say here let's go ahead and do const
41:12 - logo equal style dot div
41:16 - dot div right there and i will say right
41:18 - there and now i'm going to
41:20 - give it my my uh what's it called my
41:22 - items that i want so look at this
41:24 - cool beautiful so now what's going to
41:27 - happen this local well it's pretty
41:28 - simple
41:29 - in this logo i'm going to give it a
41:31 - number one height
41:32 - of height of 45 pixels
41:35 - 45 pixels okay right there save that
41:39 - okay that way our logo is 45 plus and
41:41 - you can see here right now
41:42 - see it's 45 pixels but the but the but
41:45 - the
41:45 - the gmail actual local image is not
41:48 - actually 45 pieces unfortunately so
41:50 - what we can do is check this out just by
41:53 - saying things like this is we're going
41:54 - to mix display flex
41:55 - and the logo look at this i will say
41:57 - here display flex
42:00 - look at the display flex and then i will
42:02 - type in after that right there
42:03 - good so save that okay and look at that
42:05 - right away gmail goes
42:07 - straight to his position right right
42:09 - away that's the cool part about it we
42:11 - just said display flex
42:12 - boom it is right there and of course and
42:15 - we can do it applause
42:16 - for us which is amazing hey there we go
42:18 - let's get going
42:20 - so we had that display effects which is
42:21 - awesome let's go ahead and now
42:23 - put this specific icon in its rifle
42:26 - place as well
42:29 - okay so what we are going to do is
42:31 - actually go back to the logo wrapper
42:34 - and we will get started with the nesting
42:38 - uh css correct into each other and it's
42:41 - going to be epic
42:42 - so inside of the logo wrapper i want to
42:45 - go ahead
42:45 - up here and just show it uh visually
42:48 - see if you can scroll up right there
42:50 - yeah so the area that i
42:52 - highlighted so if i if you see inside of
42:54 - logo wrapper
42:55 - we have this other div inside of that so
42:58 - that's exactly what we will do
43:00 - uh inside of the logo wrapper
43:03 - okay yes yes so let's go down and
43:07 - let's take a look at that okay so what
43:09 - we were doing here
43:10 - is we will just type in div because we
43:13 - are targeting
43:14 - the div inside of the logo wrapper
43:17 - does it make sense i hope it does yeah
43:19 - so we're talking this specifically right
43:20 - there see there's there right there
43:22 - okay cool yep and what we will say
43:25 - is we will go ahead and say display grid
43:28 - once again and this is where the power
43:31 - of display grid comes in because
43:33 - you know what uh display flex you would
43:35 - have to say justify content center and
43:37 - then align item
43:38 - center and that way it would be centered
43:41 - both horizontally and vertically correct
43:43 - but with display grid we can say place
43:46 - dash
43:46 - items and then just say center and it
43:49 - would just go ahead and both vertically
43:51 - and
43:51 - horizontally center it so
43:54 - if we go ahead and save it i think it
43:57 - should
43:58 - it sound this but again and then but
43:59 - then that screwed up the
44:01 - the gma because this div not only
44:03 - affected that not only did it affect
44:05 - the logo right but it also affected um
44:08 - like it affected this icon and also
44:10 - affected this so it kind of overrode the
44:12 - flags that we had before which is the
44:14 - issue right
44:14 - so to prevent that all we simply say we
44:16 - say here the menu so we say for example
44:18 - we create a new one called menu right
44:20 - there see just like that okay
44:22 - and this down the menu icons inside that
44:24 - right there
44:26 - and so what we do now is go ahead and
44:27 - create a new const
44:29 - menu menu style component right here
44:31 - we'll say
44:32 - styled style.div
44:35 - beautiful yeah style.div
44:38 - beautiful and inside now then what we're
44:41 - going to create
44:42 - is we will go ahead and now say display
44:45 - grid just for that menu so we'll say
44:47 - display grid
44:49 - okay grid place
44:52 - items what is it called place item
44:54 - center right center
44:55 - place items yeah place dash item center
44:57 - right there exactly place item center
45:00 - boom right there so you can save that
45:01 - just like that and of course not done
45:03 - yet hold on now we need to remove this
45:05 - portion
45:06 - boom remove this portion save that and
45:08 - look at that
45:09 - now this is exactly what we
45:13 - want right look at that so now we have
45:16 - our gmail icon right here we have our
45:20 - menu icon and it looks pretty damn good
45:23 - like
45:23 - that is pretty sick i would say right
45:26 - like look at this i mean
45:27 - compared to what we have here it's
45:29 - pretty much
45:31 - [ __ ] the same thing i think it even
45:33 - looks like it even looks better
45:34 - like how cool that i what like guys
45:38 - what's up what's up google uh yeah watch
45:41 - out for us watch out for us we're coming
45:42 - we're coming google that's how
45:43 - that's how good we are exactly that's
45:46 - how good we are
45:47 - awesome thank you so much let me get
45:49 - some amazing comments guys
45:50 - you guys rock awesome thank you so much
45:52 - for the amazing comments beautiful so we
45:53 - got that specific part
45:55 - next up let's go ahead and work on the
45:56 - next portion which is going to be this
45:58 - input portion right
45:59 - here let's work on this input portion
46:01 - right here okay exactly
46:02 - now we don't actually need to worry
46:05 - about the search wrapper
46:06 - uh because normally if we use display
46:09 - flex we would have to add flex
46:11 - flexo one but since we have done that up
46:14 - in the wrapper with the grid template
46:17 - columns
46:18 - auto uh we don't have to worry about
46:20 - that so we can just pretty much skip it
46:23 - but it's actually nice that we defined
46:25 - it so we can automatically this auto
46:28 - right here guys will define
46:29 - the width of this search wrapper that's
46:32 - the cool part about it because the
46:34 - search wrapper is just another
46:35 - column you see everything to the side
46:38 - okay let's keep going
46:39 - all right let's keep going so next up we
46:42 - will go into the search bar
46:44 - wrapper right not that one we're gonna
46:47 - leave it out
46:49 - okay yeah and we're gonna go into the
46:52 - search bar wrapper so that one
46:55 - and for that we would actually give a
46:58 - nice little background color
47:01 - uh yes guys and it will
47:04 - yeah uh actually that will be the whole
47:08 - wrapper
47:08 - so for that we will have this sort of
47:11 - light grayish
47:12 - color which is going to be one no it's
47:15 - going to be
47:16 - f1 f3 f4 yep
47:21 - nice nice beautiful okay good good good
47:23 - good
47:25 - good and it will have a width of
47:28 - 750 pixels right okay
47:31 - so that way it just uh goes all the way
47:35 - out and it has a fixed width now should
47:37 - we have okay
47:38 - maybe we cannot do a fix with later on
47:40 - but that's okay don't worry about that
47:41 - so we'll do that something later i mean
47:42 - for for now it's good no it's
47:44 - good yeah and
47:47 - this will have display grid as well
47:49 - again the reason why is because you can
47:51 - see here right you can see here that
47:53 - we have one column second column and
47:56 - third column and this is what we're
47:57 - going to use
47:58 - display create any situations like this
48:00 - okay
48:02 - exactly and right now the grid uh
48:05 - template column template
48:08 - column yes this is gonna be what it's
48:12 - going to be
48:12 - ten percent then auto steps for this
48:15 - seven percent autofocus
48:17 - so it's going to be 10 for this auto for
48:19 - this and 7 for this meaning
48:22 - that this is 10 percent right then we
48:24 - have basically
48:25 - 90 this is going to be 80 or actually
48:28 - this is going to be
48:29 - 90 no 87 percent on 83 percent
48:33 - no 83 yes 83 yeah yeah yeah and it's
48:35 - like you see that
48:37 - that's how that works with with uh
48:40 - with uh auto now i kind of want to
48:43 - change this to 100 though i don't want
48:44 - to
48:45 - keep it constant i kind of just want to
48:47 - do like this because
48:49 - right there see i think that makes a
48:50 - little better so the reason we can't
48:52 - make it a hundred percent
48:54 - is that go back to gmail please okay
48:57 - let's see this
49:00 - so if you go back to the original gmail
49:02 - and actually full screen it this is
49:03 - original
49:05 - no no uh just full screen the app
49:08 - do i have to yeah because it will prove
49:12 - the point oh yeah so
49:13 - i see what you mean so basically it sets
49:15 - the max so here's what we can do
49:17 - to do that we can set a max width of 750
49:19 - pixels look at this right so we can say
49:21 - for example
49:22 - if i go to rectap i can say something
49:24 - like yes the width is 100 so we can say
49:26 - for example
49:27 - with 100 but i can say max width
49:30 - max width max width is 750. yep
49:35 - and so that means now if i go ahead and
49:37 - expand this look at this if i expand
49:39 - this
49:40 - it will only expand to 750 boom right
49:42 - there see

49:47 - years of experience
49:47 - yeah yeah yeah
49:48 - [Laughter]
49:51 - right you tend to just kind of stuff
49:53 - often and then you learn how to do it
49:54 - right so
49:55 - right there but there you go i see why
49:58 - you are the instructor
50:00 - inside of our course profit with

50:05 - the best courses out there on the planet
50:07 - literally no not one of the best the
50:09 - best course the best on the planet
50:11 - to become a javascript developer okay
50:13 - keep going all right cool
50:15 - so next up uh we will do place items
50:18 - center right so just so we have
50:22 - everything centered out and we don't
50:24 - have to worry about
50:25 - uh centering them in any ways so we
50:27 - would just type in
50:28 - place items center
50:33 - and i made a typo again cool and
50:36 - we will give this one a height of 45
50:39 - pixels
50:40 - as well okay and give it a border
50:43 - radius okay uh ready
50:46 - six pixels again and how he kind of is
50:48 - doing that right because he's given the
50:49 - height just how we have in the original
50:51 - gmail right
50:52 - then he's centering everything so make
50:53 - sure that to make sure that everything
50:55 - is centered right like this right here
50:58 - so make sure it's ever all centered
50:59 - and border radius is to make it kind of
51:01 - this concave portion right here you see
51:03 - it kind of like rounds up very nicely
51:05 - that's the border radius portion okay
51:06 - let's keep going
51:08 - let's go inside ah we just got the troll
51:10 - in the comments somebody

52:26 - that's what i'm talking about that's
52:29 - okay anyways
52:30 - let's keep going yeah you guys are the
52:32 - best
52:33 - always let me make sure all right okay
52:35 - oh good
52:36 - all right moving on someone goes i'm two
52:39 - years old okay
52:40 - okay that's fine too all right so we've
52:42 - got so we will go ahead and start
52:44 - nesting css once again
52:46 - now we will target the input uh field in
52:49 - in in the middle and we will give it a
52:51 - width
52:52 - of uh 100 so basically it will
52:56 - take up as much space as it actually can
52:59 - right and
53:00 - next up we will give it a height of 30
53:02 - pixels
53:03 - so it will almost take up the whole
53:05 - wrapper
53:06 - but it's oh my god why what's wrong with
53:09 - the indentation
53:11 - and then we will give it a background of
53:15 - none so that way we don't have that
53:18 - ugly uh background look
53:21 - to it we will also delete the border
53:25 - so we will give that a border of the
53:27 - none as well
53:29 - and we will give it a font
53:33 - size of 18 pixels okay so basically we
53:36 - will just make it
53:37 - make it a little bit bigger and
53:40 - now what we need to do is add a uh colon
53:44 - focus
53:45 - because now as if you if you actually go
53:47 - ahead and click inside of the
53:49 - uh yeah you see all that yeah
53:53 - it looks like it looks horrible like
53:55 - it's like
53:56 - yeah how do you know somebody is a
53:58 - beginner web developer
54:00 - and actually haven't watched our channel
54:02 - yeah they leave it there
54:04 - so again and the way the way we can
54:05 - actually track it to make sure the way
54:06 - it works if
54:07 - is if i inspect down but on this one you
54:09 - can see right like i go the input
54:11 - i can actually force look at i can force
54:13 - hover or i can force focus
54:15 - right i force focus right here and then
54:18 - like
54:18 - uh let's go force uh not for for state
54:22 - focus within active no yeah because i
54:25 - actually
54:27 - hold on hold on come on right there
54:29 - let's see
54:30 - if i force focus you can see now if i
54:32 - scroll down
54:33 - if i scroll down you can see it says
54:35 - outline you see focus visible
54:38 - uh i'll go back go back to here go back
54:39 - to here see it says
54:41 - focus where is it
54:44 - where is it oh my god where is it
54:49 - hold on hold on focus
54:52 - let's do one more time for state focus
54:55 - now okay right there so you can see here
55:00 - oh you saw it right there it's like it
55:02 - said grid outline offset so outline
55:04 - right there
55:05 - that's how we go ahead and go to outline
55:07 - we go outline and we said okay
55:09 - fine okay find it
55:11 - [Laughter]
55:14 - so save that okay save that and this is
55:17 - what we have so now we have no outline
55:18 - it's exactly what we want
55:20 - now we need okay look how sick that
55:22 - looks that looks pretty sick i would say
55:24 - should we change the colors of these
55:25 - icons a little bit i think these icons
55:27 - are a little bit more like
55:29 - yes i think so look i can actually
55:32 - actually inspect them
55:32 - on this icon that we currently have
55:34 - inside inside
55:36 - and in the original in the original
55:38 - gmail right literally we're kind of
55:39 - we're hacking a little bit here but
55:41 - that's completely fine
55:42 - then look i have the color right here
55:45 - 5f6368 so
55:46 - i will go ahead and copy this and now
55:48 - just copy it and
55:49 - i will give you the actual uh
55:54 - what's that called div that you want to
55:55 - target because material ui icons has
55:58 - this
55:59 - mui svg icon dash root
56:03 - and for that we will need to give a
56:05 - color and
56:06 - that's where you put it yes i think so
56:08 - there's multiple ways you can put that
56:10 - but let's for now let's put that there
56:11 - there's more ways you can put that
56:12 - actually
56:13 - there's one i think this is how you do
56:14 - it uh well there's might be wrong
56:16 - i mean so there's there's actually a few
56:17 - ways you can do it one way because you
56:19 - can do it this way
56:20 - and so now you can see the icon there
56:21 - another way you can actually do is check
56:22 - this out guys here you want to see
56:24 - something cool
56:25 - look so here's what you do you can do
56:26 - for example let's say i can do
56:28 - here i can say for example search search
56:32 - search okay right and what's
56:36 - what that's going to happen is that's
56:37 - actually going to be the search the
56:38 - search
56:39 - icon wrapper look at this look at this
56:43 - you'll see what i mean hold on hold on
56:46 - hold on that's not it hold on hold on
56:48 - uh wrap it up then what i do is i go to
56:50 - search like a wrapper i scroll down this
56:52 - is the cool part about style components
56:53 - so watch this carefully okay
56:55 - i can do const and i say search icon
56:58 - wrapper
56:59 - right icon wrapper
57:04 - wrapper equals look at this styled
57:08 - check this out styled search icon
57:12 - and now inside here i can define the
57:15 - color of this
57:18 - dang bro i can define what's happening
57:20 - there i can define
57:22 - now the color of this specific uh let me
57:24 - go ahead and put the tab on here
57:26 - right here i can define a color which is
57:28 - going to be which color
57:30 - this color there so that means if i
57:32 - remove this right here
57:34 - even if i remove this portion right if i
57:36 - place it into this search icon wrapper
57:39 - right if i go here
57:42 - right there see now this wrapper this
57:46 - look at this
57:46 - i'm not sure why that went all the way
57:48 - that just [ __ ] up everything else
57:49 - there
57:51 - because we only defined three columns
57:53 - and now we have so i go ahead i can do
57:55 - command
57:55 - right there so save that look at that
57:57 - you see
57:58 - now this icon has that color
58:03 - nice how cool is that huh how cool is
58:06 - that
58:06 - that's what happened is i define i
58:08 - define my own style component
58:10 - right there right so called search icon
58:12 - wrapper and i said
58:14 - okay let's go ahead and make the style
58:15 - component make that
58:17 - be what make that be a uh where did i
58:20 - just say it what did i do what did i do
58:22 - where is it where is it really right
58:23 - there it's a bit about yeah search like
58:25 - a wrapper
58:25 - and i say it's a style component with a
58:28 - search icon as kind of like the input it
58:30 - is almost like inheriting that class
58:32 - it's inheriting the icon and then it's
58:34 - redefining the color of the icon
58:36 - that's it that's cool yeah but we can
58:39 - also really cool yeah but you can also
58:40 - of course put that inside here so inside
58:42 - there
58:42 - let's put the svg root back into here so
58:45 - go ahead david
58:46 - okay m-u-i-s-v-g icon dash root
58:51 - bomb color and
58:54 - you have it on your yeah alfred yeah so
58:56 - let me copy that here
58:58 - boom command c and i'll do command v
59:00 - right here okay
59:02 - save that now every single eye comes
59:04 - like that and look how sick that looks
59:05 - guys it looks so
59:06 - good so good
59:11 - hey so good so good so good
59:14 - i got it
59:17 - [Music]
59:19 - music that we listen together come on
59:22 - [Laughter]
59:25 - all right keep going let's go ahead and
59:26 - do this we need now a few things we need
59:27 - to fix now
59:28 - that's going to be which which which
59:30 - thing so we need to now fix yeah this
59:32 - position
59:33 - last but not least in the header we will
59:36 - have the icons wrapper on the right
59:38 - hand very right hand side so for that we
59:41 - will use display grid once again
59:44 - and we will have a grid
59:47 - dash template uh columns
59:51 - and that will now now i'm going to do
59:54 - something
59:55 - something crazy go ahead go ahead so
59:56 - what i will do what is it what is it
59:58 - i'm curious i'm a lazy guy okay so if i
60:01 - wanted uh flexo one for what times i
60:03 - would have to
60:04 - type auto four times but i'm a lazy dude
60:07 - so what i will say is i'm just gonna say
60:09 - repeat oh just repeat what
60:12 - four times auto whoa hold on hold on
60:15 - hold the phone
60:16 - hold the phone david hold on
60:20 - oh [ __ ] really wow that's cool
60:24 - damn that deserves this right here
60:27 - damn that's good yeah that is what i'm
60:30 - talking about
60:31 - holy moly so this i'm not gonna type
60:35 - all these stuff out like so this is
60:37 - saying my time is more valuable than
60:39 - that
60:39 - are you sure i don't have time
60:43 - time to just type some of them stuff
60:45 - okay i can go grid template columns
60:46 - repeat for auto means that basically
60:48 - every single column in here
60:51 - that means i will repeat auto four times
60:54 - it's gonna be
60:55 - auto for all of these support it's gonna
60:57 - be so basically auto it's gonna it's
60:59 - going to basically
61:00 - equally different it equally space out
61:02 - all the columns
61:04 - that is pretty sick i'm i'm pretty sure
61:06 - i am that's oh wow i'm actually i'm
61:08 - that's pretty cool
61:08 - i'm just save it please
61:12 - save it oh let's go
61:15 - that's what i'm saying that's what's up
61:17 - look at that that's awesome okay let's
61:19 - go keep going dude
61:21 - all right next up uh we will have we
61:23 - will once again want to set the
61:25 - colors of those uh material ui
61:28 - squeegee icon awesome root
61:31 - thingies and we will just gonna give it
61:33 - a i mean
61:35 - you know that color yeah i got the color
61:37 - i got you i got you i got you
61:38 - one right there dope that's the color so
61:40 - now the colors back so you can see now
61:42 - that
61:43 - these are the ones of color so you can
61:44 - see look how close that looks look at
61:46 - that okay
61:46 - now we'll probably add some space a
61:47 - little bit later on in a little bit
61:49 - that's completely fine don't worry about
61:50 - that
61:50 - but i think the really cool part is the
61:53 - fact that
61:54 - like it's spaced out it looks good it's
61:57 - functional it's the awesome part
61:58 - right and one thing to keep track of is
62:01 - you can see how we're putting a class in
62:03 - here
62:04 - inside this style div so this is almost
62:06 - like
62:07 - kind of like traversing a tree right
62:09 - what's going to happen
62:10 - is it's almost like you want to think
62:11 - about this that that hold on
62:13 - let me show this to you right here let
62:15 - me do a brush
62:16 - so you just added a b in there come on
62:19 - you're really
62:20 - bad bro hold on so we have this icons
62:22 - wrapper right here okay
62:23 - what's going to happen is we're going to
62:25 - target the mu
62:26 - mui srg icon inside this icons wrapper
62:30 - that's a cool part about components
62:32 - and so for example if i wanted to also
62:34 - like let's say if i want to target
62:35 - something else i can say for example
62:37 - like
62:37 - i know image let's say for example to
62:39 - target an image
62:40 - that's within the icons wrapper you see
62:43 - what i mean
62:44 - that's how that works again really
62:47 - really really useful right
62:49 - this is what style components are so
62:50 - good this is what we can't
62:52 - do in inside normal css unfortunately in
62:54 - like normal css yeah
62:56 - but inside components we can and so we
62:58 - do because that's how we do because
63:00 - cool okay cool all right exactly with
63:03 - that yeah
63:03 - i just want to address a few comments uh
63:06 - in the chat section
63:07 - so the reason why we have part one two
63:10 - and three
63:11 - is because we are not just going to give
63:13 - you guys the front end
63:15 - we are actually going to build a fully
63:17 - functional
63:18 - email client that you can send and
63:20 - receive emails with
63:22 - uh but in order to actually process
63:25 - all that stuff that we are actually
63:27 - teaching because there's a lot of new
63:28 - stuff here
63:31 - in terms of like style components we
63:33 - have display grid and
63:35 - all these other stuff we will just go a
63:36 - little slower and today is only going to
63:39 - be front end
63:40 - only but then as we proceed further we
63:43 - will have more stuff in there exactly
63:45 - exactly
63:45 - and one other thing guys we are 662
63:48 - likes let's get to 700 guys come on like
63:51 - this video
63:52 - 700 likes you got this almost 700 come
63:56 - on
63:56 - let's get to 700 we're cooling at 664.
64:01 - i know you guys can do it come on come
64:02 - on come on come on come on come on come
64:04 - on
64:05 - oh that's awesome you got to 600 let's
64:07 - we'll celebrate when you get when we get
64:08 - to 700.
64:09 - okay whoa 6.85
64:12 - holy moly already six ninety two eight
64:14 - nine come on come on
64:17 - i'm not going for it for 6.99 let's do
64:20 - it
64:20 - let's do it
64:26 - guys this is way too good this is way
64:28 - too much fun
64:32 - let's go 700 you guys are the best we
64:35 - love you so much
64:36 - okay next up next up let's can we add
64:39 - some
64:40 - margin here i'll kind of want to add
64:41 - some margin to to this specific icon i
64:43 - mean we can
64:44 - we can do that i kind of want to do that
64:47 - uh to do that i let's go ahead for this
64:50 - specific portion we're going to say
64:51 - um i'm going to say margin left
64:55 - let's do margin left of 8 pixels because
64:57 - i just want to add some
64:58 - a little bit of a little bit spacing
65:00 - spacing is actually very important in
65:01 - code just so you know
65:02 - because if you look at here for example
65:04 - you can see there's spacing in this
65:06 - specific element
65:07 - this is actual gmail and if you look at
65:09 - an actual gmail
65:11 - you can see this gmail let me see i'm
65:12 - going to show it to you has spacing also
65:14 - it has padding left six pixels
65:16 - and padding right even like two pixels
65:18 - for example
65:19 - but they are very nice as based out
65:20 - which is a really cool portion that i
65:22 - like
65:22 - like you see here right there look at
65:23 - that beautiful all right cool so we got
65:25 - oh look look at that even though you see
65:27 - how it's spaced out
65:28 - and this is they're actually using grid
65:29 - i'm guessing right are they
65:31 - they're using what's right they're
65:32 - actually using grid i feel like no
65:35 - i don't know i feel like they are i feel
65:38 - like they are
65:39 - using flags never mind they're just
65:40 - sniffing i mean they just could still
65:42 - fight at some point they use flux and
65:43 - then they use grid like
65:46 - all right i don't know we got that it
65:49 - looks good okay next up
65:50 - what the next thing we're going to work
65:52 - on guys is what is what
65:55 - it is going to be the sidebar so it's
65:58 - going to be the left
65:59 - portion the very left portion yes that
66:02 - exact
66:02 - part uh honestly i haven't
66:06 - ever seen that pause inbox button so we
66:08 - will just
66:09 - forget about that but don't worry about
66:11 - that apart from that we will have
66:12 - everything
66:12 - yeah so look so here's the thing now to
66:15 - create a sidebar we have to consider not
66:16 - just a side but we have to consider the
66:18 - sidebar
66:19 - and also this right hand portion
66:22 - and also like that's this specific
66:25 - portion right
66:26 - this specific portion as well right so
66:27 - we consider everything exactly and now
66:29 - to consider everything
66:30 - what you have to think about is okay
66:32 - well how do i put it into a component
66:34 - and how do i style it
66:35 - to weigh so that it's in grid and
66:37 - columns right
66:38 - think about if you had this in a column
66:40 - right if you had this in the column
66:41 - right here
66:42 - yeah see column column
66:46 - what's going to happen is pretty simple
66:48 - we will go ahead and actually
66:51 - create a component called main which is
66:54 - going to contain
66:56 - it's going to contain all of these other
66:58 - columns
66:59 - the sidebar column the
67:02 - views column whatever it's called it's
67:04 - called the the inbox column
67:06 - and then the site icons column what am i
67:09 - called so let's create that by the way
67:11 - i'm going to go to app.js that's not
67:15 - what i want
67:16 - oh come on you got it
67:19 - yeah i got it how do i okay command p oh
67:22 - there we go
67:23 - app.js okay inside the header we're
67:25 - going to now continue
67:26 - created to create a main component like
67:28 - this right there okay create a main
67:30 - component
67:31 - and of course now we need to create it
67:33 - inside our
67:34 - file instead of components so inside
67:36 - component let's go ahead and do
67:37 - file new file that goes into layer thank
67:41 - you
67:42 - thank you and then i'm going to type in
67:43 - rf
67:45 - to create the component beautiful and
67:47 - that is now our component so we have
67:49 - with the main component right here and
67:50 - of course we need to now import that
67:52 - component inside
67:53 - the main so we're going to do that right
67:54 - now to do that all we simply say is
67:56 - we'll say import
67:58 - main let's go ahead and close this out
68:00 - main
68:01 - from from from what
68:05 - from like this i'm going to say
68:07 - component
68:09 - boom we'll say layout slash
68:13 - layout slash what
68:18 - main no main.js just me right there okay
68:22 - and so now we can import that main
68:23 - component if we go to main.js
68:25 - let's go and type in cp just to make
68:27 - sure it's all working
68:28 - go right boom right there you see now we
68:30 - have cp right there just really small
68:32 - nothing too much
68:33 - but but right there yeah awesome
68:36 - so cool now within this we're going to
68:40 - create what
68:40 - we're going to create three more we're
68:43 - going to create
68:44 - three more components three more columns
68:47 - exactly that's again we create this as a
68:50 - wrapper as a container and i'm going to
68:52 - create
68:52 - three more columns all right now let's
68:54 - go ahead and call this a wrapper
68:58 - wrapper right there nice thank you okay
69:02 - okay it says wrap is undefined again
69:03 - because we're going to create add a
69:05 - style component
69:06 - so let's say import import styled so
69:09 - import styled
69:12 - from styled components
69:16 - component components right there
69:20 - awesome okay that way it will give us
69:22 - the ability to do
69:23 - const for example wrapper is equal to
69:27 - styled
69:29 - style dot div right there boom right
69:32 - there see style.diff okay save that
69:34 - beautiful i just wanna
69:36 - plug in something real quick so guys i
69:38 - don't know if you've
69:39 - noticed that we actually haven't ever
69:42 - used
69:43 - uh class name in here yeah we don't have
69:45 - to worry about that
69:46 - anymore because literally all these
69:49 - style things
69:50 - are local to that specific file that we
69:53 - define them in
69:54 - so in case you would miss miss out or
69:57 - you're not following any naming
69:58 - convention
70:00 - and you mistakenly give the same class
70:03 - name to you
70:04 - to uh divs this will never happen again
70:07 - with styled components
70:08 - so it's it's super safe and it makes
70:10 - your life so much easier yes yes
70:12 - always always always and again guys i to
70:15 - i just kind of want to be serious here
70:16 - we have a five day react.js challenge
70:19 - coming up february 22nd completely free
70:21 - for you where we're going to be building
70:23 - a slack clone
70:24 - just like how we're building a gmail
70:25 - clone here in five days you'll get to
70:27 - learn how to build a slackline you'll
70:28 - get to learn react.js
70:30 - and you'll get to most importantly
70:32 - kickstart your career
70:33 - as a react gs developer free no
70:36 - questions asked you'd be stupid not to
70:39 - do it i mean not so you'd be used to but
70:40 - it would be stupid not to do it link is
70:43 - below it's the second
70:44 - link right react.js challenge check it
70:46 - out join starting february 22nd you do
70:48 - not want to miss out awesome
70:50 - so i just dropped it in the chat too so
70:53 - it's pretty hard to miss from now on so
70:55 - inside the wrapper as we said we have
70:57 - one we're going to create
70:58 - three more components one is going to be
70:59 - side the sidebar component
71:01 - right cyber component then we're going
71:05 - to create which component the
71:06 - emails you component right yes let's go
71:09 - to emails view
71:10 - emails view uh let's go do like this
71:12 - email you know
71:14 - emails view component okay
71:17 - and then finally it's going to we will
71:18 - have the what i called it side icons but
71:21 - if you want to call it like maybe
71:22 - shortcuts or something yes i think
71:24 - that's cool all right
71:26 - you go ahead and i'll take the drive
71:29 - okay
71:29 - so what i would do now is i actually
71:32 - went ahead and already created this
71:34 - sidebar.js file
71:35 - because we still need to do that and
71:38 - now we also need to create the emails
71:41 - view
71:42 - dot js file okay as well as the
71:46 - uh i think it's showing up yep as well
71:49 - as the
71:49 - s well what i was typing i was typing in
71:53 - the
71:53 - wrong place and now we can just we can
71:57 - just say
71:57 - side icons dot js that's going to be
72:00 - another new file
72:02 - and so that and to make sure that these
72:05 - are actually working
72:06 - uh what i will do is just go into each
72:09 - and every single one of those files and
72:11 - just type in rafce
72:14 - and that will pretty much go ahead and
72:16 - create a react arrow function component
72:19 - i will repeat that with all these three
72:21 - files
72:22 - which is good and now i can pretty much
72:25 - go ahead and go back to main.js
72:28 - right and we can
72:31 - i don't even know where it is oh yeah
72:32 - here it is and we can we can just import
72:35 - all of them okay
72:36 - into main.js so yes
72:39 - that is correct so we'll just grab this
72:43 - and boom right there awesome look at
72:45 - that so we have now emails you were
72:46 - imported from the emails view
72:48 - right then we're importing sidebar then
72:50 - again and the reason why
72:51 - we have dot slash is because the main
72:54 - component
72:55 - is now within right it is now within
72:58 - the layout folder that's we don't have
73:00 - to say layout slash or component slash
73:02 - layout
73:03 - we simply just say you know dot slash
73:05 - right there
73:06 - dot slash okay exactly that's cool and
73:09 - you can see now everything's working now
73:10 - we don't see anything of course
73:12 - but it's okay that's not an issue i mean
73:15 - we what we can do
73:16 - what i like to do is just uh just to
73:18 - visually show it that we have this
73:20 - sidebar
73:21 - we have the emails and i'm just gonna
73:23 - type in
73:24 - random uh stuff in here so we can just
73:27 - see that
73:27 - everything is actually in there and it's
73:29 - working
73:30 - and we are still waiting for the icons
73:33 - to say
73:34 - emails view you can see right there and
73:35 - his site icon so he just simply just put
73:37 - those
73:38 - in there so let's go ahead and say yeah
73:39 - beautiful that's the icons all right
73:41 - so oh dope okay so everything is showing
73:44 - up
73:45 - so let's get started with the uh
73:48 - sidebar.js file
73:49 - i think that's going to be like we can
73:52 - just go from left to right
73:54 - and so for that we're going into
73:57 - sidebar.js
73:58 - and as as we are already kind of used to
74:02 - it
74:02 - we will get started with a rapper uh
74:06 - which is going to uh make us make our
74:08 - app freak out immediately so we will
74:10 - just say const
74:12 - wrapper right here you see
74:15 - wrapper that's gonna be the wrapper okay
74:17 - beautiful
74:19 - so we will go ahead and import style
74:21 - from oops
74:22 - style from styled components
74:26 - yes good good and
74:29 - we can quickly go ahead and define or
74:31 - like declare the
74:33 - wrapper which is going to be the cost
74:35 - wrapper
74:36 - yes style.div exactly okay good good
74:40 - good
74:40 - awesome dope okay
74:46 - what what what's so funny no i'm just
74:49 - looking at your inbox
74:51 - i know oh grace stop big fan
74:55 - i don't know how he got the email i
74:58 - haven't shown the email that's the crazy
74:59 - part
75:01 - oh but anyway let's keep going let's go
75:02 - now let's go who knows let's keep going
75:04 - yeah and so inside of our wrapper we
75:07 - will have the
75:09 - so first let's take a look at how it
75:10 - looks like because
75:12 - on the top or on the left hand side we
75:14 - will on the top have the compose button
75:17 - with the pause inbox button we can
75:19 - actually add that to
75:20 - like i don't know for now let's do
75:24 - composer now
75:25 - okay okay so we would we will have a
75:28 - compose wrapper
75:29 - because uh it's it's so much easier when
75:32 - you have
75:33 - everything in boxes and organized and
75:34 - all that stuff yes so first thing first
75:37 - we will have a compose
75:39 - uh rapper yes
75:42 - and oh uh
75:48 - right there and that's going to create
75:51 - that and then inside there we're going
75:52 - to create a compose
75:53 - button that's just like this okay right
75:55 - here okay nice
75:57 - so i will just add in it as a comment
76:01 - for now so we will actually create the
76:03 - compose button
76:04 - as a completely different um nice what
76:07 - is that
76:07 - component yes yes yes yes
76:11 - and we will also have a side
76:14 - buttons nice so these buttons are going
76:17 - to grab
76:18 - these buttons right here you see how we
76:19 - have these buttons right here that's
76:21 - going to be
76:21 - exactly and then inside there we're
76:22 - going to have like an input inbox button
76:24 - a start button a snooze button and so
76:26 - forth but we're going to define those a
76:27 - little bit later on okay
76:29 - exactly that's just yeah exactly it's
76:31 - just so cool to
76:33 - just figure out like how we will go
76:35 - about it
76:36 - and then down below uh like
76:39 - right below it uh we will have i called
76:42 - it a
76:43 - meat wrapper because it it actually
76:45 - integrates with the google meat
76:48 - so we would just have that too so the
76:51 - meat wrapper
76:52 - the meat wrapper is going to be this one
76:53 - guys you see how we have the meat right
76:54 - here that's going to be the meat wrapper
76:56 - right there you see i'm kind of as i'm
76:57 - making these
76:58 - as his type i'm making these outlines
77:00 - you can see right here this can be very
77:01 - helpful for you guys to to see
77:03 - how you know this stuff kind of comes
77:05 - together okay
77:06 - yes and then right below that we will
77:10 - have a
77:10 - hangout hangouts rapper and that's gonna
77:13 - be the last
77:14 - stuff yes
77:18 - and actually where like way down below
77:22 - at the very bottom
77:23 - uh we have that this one right there i
77:26 - call the bottom rapper
77:27 - bottom rapper it's a weird name you got
77:29 - david button rapper
77:31 - the bottom rapper how would you call
77:33 - bottom rapper the bottom
77:35 - rapper rapper bottom icons
77:39 - rapper cool yes yes yes yes the bottom
77:43 - wrapper yes
77:44 - it's got the button i wrap the whole
77:45 - button on it buttonhole okay
77:48 - now uh don't save the app because it's
77:52 - going to just
77:53 - go crazy okay but what we would do
77:56 - is once again i'm a lazy dude so i'm
77:59 - just gonna
78:00 - uh copy paste like we will have the comp
78:02 - compose we will have side buttons
78:05 - right there uh meat hangouts and bottom
78:08 - yeah i think i think it's enough so i'm
78:11 - just going to go ahead and then copy
78:13 - paste
78:14 - all these uh things in here because all
78:17 - of these
78:17 - are actually divs so we can we can we
78:21 - can pretty much do it
78:22 - nice and yeah
78:26 - it's cool and let's take a look at
78:28 - what's happening now okay so let's see
78:30 - if we go ahead and now save this
78:32 - okay let's go direct app and if we save
78:35 - that
78:35 - yeah we should pretty much have nothing
78:38 - yes
78:51 - okay cool so uh actually let's go back
78:54 - to
78:54 - main.js because uh we need to create all
78:58 - those uh columns
78:59 - so for that we will once again use
79:02 - display grid
79:03 - so actually remember like all the
79:05 - sidebar the emails view and then the
79:07 - icons are side by side next to each
79:09 - other so for that
79:10 - we will use once again display uh grid
79:12 - nice
79:13 - and we will have a grid template
79:17 - columns
79:20 - and then remember that on uh in the
79:23 - header we had
79:24 - 270 pixels for for the logo and all that
79:27 - uh
79:28 - left side of portions nice so we will do
79:30 - 270 pixels
79:32 - then auto and then instead of 170 like
79:35 - we did in the
79:36 - header we would just use 50 because
79:38 - otherwise it wouldn't
79:40 - make any sense to have such a big
79:44 - uh shortcut thing okay good good good
79:46 - let's keep going
79:48 - so this right here so this portion right
79:50 - here guys again this right here
79:51 - i'm gonna go to the arrow tool this
79:53 - right here is going to be
79:55 - the 270 right that's gonna be that one
79:57 - the auto is going to be
79:59 - this one and then the 50p is going to be
80:00 - the little small part right here
80:02 - that's it you see that's we did we now
80:03 - defined three separate columns
80:06 - this is all we have to do in inside
80:07 - display great that's the really cool
80:09 - part about this okay let's keep going
80:13 - okay so we got that portion okay let's
80:14 - go ahead and save this up to make sure
80:16 - we got it let's go back to oh and look
80:17 - at that right there see
80:18 - email's auto you see right there imazada
80:20 - was already put in the center
80:22 - and the sidebar is already here and then
80:23 - the icon is already here beautiful it's
80:25 - exactly what we want right
80:26 - and we can use them later on i can even
80:28 - give them like a custom some kind of a
80:29 - color later on as well
80:30 - but that's fine let's just keep going
80:32 - with what we need to do and focus on
80:34 - the sidebar exactly so for the sidebar
80:38 - uh let's take a look at what we will
80:40 - have so let's get
80:41 - let's actually get started with the
80:42 - compose uh item
80:45 - so what we will do is we will just add a
80:47 - new
80:48 - um what's that called component which we
80:51 - will call compose and this is
80:53 - this is where we will need to import a
80:55 - new uh
80:56 - button so what we will do is go into the
80:58 - compose folder
80:59 - create a brand new folder and we will
81:01 - call it
81:02 - uh oops i'm in the wrong folder so
81:07 - we will need to go into compo like make
81:09 - sure to you that you go into components
81:12 - and you want to create a
81:15 - buttons folder let's go and do that
81:18 - right there so inside the components
81:19 - we're going to get our buttons folder
81:20 - right there
81:21 - right there so you can see we have a
81:22 - bonus folder right there beautiful okay
81:24 - awesome
81:25 - and then inside there we're going to
81:26 - create a compose button right
81:28 - so let's go ahead and do that yeah in
81:30 - just a second because i actually
81:32 - initialized the button okay now we're
81:34 - cool so inside of the buttons folder
81:38 - uh we will have a compose dot js
81:42 - okay let's go ahead and do that so let's
81:43 - go right click and we'll say new file of
81:45 - course
81:46 - and so i think that david has done that
81:48 - for us
81:50 - not yet not yet do you want to do it i'm
81:52 - still so i'm just
81:53 - so i'm just i'm just doing compose.js
81:57 - and we are good on that side okay good
81:59 - and i'm just going to type in
82:01 - rafce once again react arrow function
82:03 - export component
82:04 - boom and let's actually imported it
82:08 - right away inside of our sidebar
82:11 - so what we'll say is import and then go
82:14 - up a level of folders
82:16 - and we was oh geez yeah import compose
82:19 - i'm a bit faster than i'm thinking ahead
82:22 - two way too fast way too fast david
82:24 - way too fast yeah i'm using safari
82:27 - that's why i'm fast
82:31 - come on sorry it just
82:34 - made me cracked up it's funny
82:38 - so what i would say i will go up a level
82:41 - of folders
82:43 - go into buttons and then inside of that
82:46 - i will
82:47 - i will grab the compose component
82:50 - and it should actually uh fix things
82:53 - for us and again there is something the
82:55 - reason why we're doing this this
82:56 - up means because we're calling the
82:58 - sidebar remember the sidebar is where
83:00 - the sidebar is in here okay so we
83:02 - actually need to go up
83:03 - we need to go up a level we need to go
83:05 - up from here sidebar
83:07 - back to the components level right in
83:09 - here and then down to the buns level
83:11 - right so
83:11 - this means go up back to the components
83:14 - level that's what this means
83:15 - then we go down to the buttons level and
83:17 - then we go to the compose button
83:19 - that's why we're doing that specifically
83:21 - okay okay let me go ahead and save this
83:22 - just so we have it okay
83:23 - good yes okay so back to sidebar
83:28 - okay we're cool we're cool all righty
83:32 - so next up what we will do is i just
83:34 - added a compose
83:36 - text into the compose button so we can
83:38 - see that it is actually getting imported
83:40 - and now what we will do
83:43 - is once again use material ui
83:47 - and we will use the add icon from
83:49 - material ui that's going to be that
83:51 - little uh
83:52 - plus sign yes exactly uh yep
83:55 - icon that's so real that's good that's
83:56 - going to be this icon right here guys
83:58 - see this add icon
83:59 - that's the add icon we're talking about
84:01 - okay next up
84:03 - next up because we are using uh
84:06 - what's that styled components we will
84:08 - name it uh we will rename the div
84:11 - wrapper so we will say import uh
84:14 - what's that styled from
84:18 - styled components so that's good on that
84:21 - part but we need to
84:22 - uh define it so we will say cons wrapper
84:25 - equals tile dot div
84:29 - backtick nice nice nice nice
84:33 - cool and we will add the add icon
84:36 - in here and we will make the font size
84:40 - of large we will just pass it in because
84:44 - once again these
84:45 - icons are at the end of the day they are
84:47 - components uh components as well
84:49 - yes and they accept oh by the way we
84:51 - just got 800 likes let's go
84:55 - let's get to 900 guys let's get to 900
84:58 - likes can we get that i know we can't
85:00 - come on let's go
85:01 - that's sick man we got that bro
85:05 - oh man we can get to 900 likes i know it
85:09 - at least 850 at least 850. trust me i
85:11 - know it anyways
85:12 - all right you guys are the best as
85:13 - always thank you so much
85:15 - nice so hey what's up welcome everybody
85:19 - i saw a few people uh
85:22 - a few people saying that it's their
85:25 - first stream so welcome
85:26 - nice so cool guys so you can see here we
85:28 - have the compose we have the compose
85:30 - text
85:30 - which kind of represents specifically
85:32 - this specific portion we have the add
85:34 - icon right here which
85:35 - represents this portion now if we go
85:37 - ahead and save this you can see that
85:38 - really that doesn't really
85:39 - look good at all because if i go to here
85:41 - it's just kind of here
85:42 - so we need to put that into a button so
85:44 - how do we do that right now so to put
85:45 - that into a button
85:46 - that should be pretty simple right well
85:48 - the first thing to do is we need to
85:50 - define
85:50 - a this wrapper and to tell it the width
85:53 - and the width for the add icon and the
85:55 - width for
85:56 - the p tag right so to do that i will say
85:58 - this what
85:59 - yeah display grid yeah what we would say
86:01 - we will say display grid
86:03 - okay we're using display today then
86:05 - we'll go to something then we will have
86:07 - hold on template columns yes we'll say
86:09 - grid we'll say template
86:11 - slash columns columns okay
86:15 - and here we'll say we will say 35 and
86:18 - then auto
86:18 - 35 in auto meaning that the add icons
86:22 - will be 35
86:23 - and the compose could be auto so you can
86:25 - see that's that's pretty cool now
86:27 - also we're going to give it a what
86:29 - should we give it do we give it a width
86:30 - the compose icon is that was there wait
86:32 - for the composite or no
86:34 - uh it's going to be auto okay with his
86:36 - auto okay that's fine with is going to
86:38 - be auto
86:38 - with is going to be auto now of course
86:40 - let's now make this really nice style
86:42 - you can see here
86:43 - we have like this box shadow and we have
86:44 - some border radius so
86:46 - let's actually do this for now i'm going
86:47 - to say here i'm going to say
86:50 - background color just so we have
86:51 - something background color
86:54 - let's make that orange i know i know i
86:56 - know i know it's going to hideous don't
86:57 - worry just
86:58 - just listen up here right so background
87:01 - color is going to be orange okay right
87:04 - now of course now of course
87:05 - i know i know yeah
87:09 - i know i know i know i know i know i
87:11 - know but don't worry about this okay
87:13 - that's music yeah i didn't know it
87:14 - really was but
87:16 - now what we're going to do is we'll go
87:18 - ahead and well for one
87:19 - let's align them center so we'll say
87:21 - align items
87:23 - line items say uh center
87:26 - items equal to centered for everything
87:28 - cool item center
87:29 - that you seek a center is basically the
87:31 - plus and the compose uh is there a
87:33 - height of this or no should we give it a
87:34 - height no
87:35 - we actually have padding so we're going
87:37 - to give padding to this specific portion
87:38 - let's go ahead and give some padding to
87:40 - this we'll say padding
87:41 - okay and we're going to give it six
87:44 - pixels top
87:45 - and so forth so look at this six pixels
87:47 - then 32 pixels and i'm explaining
87:49 - i will explain what that means in a
87:50 - second here 32 pixels six pixels
87:52 - and then eight pixels so what does this
87:55 - mean
87:56 - i want you to remember here one simple
87:58 - thing something called
87:59 - trouble right you're like holy [ __ ] what
88:02 - does this mean us well don't worry about
88:03 - this i got you
88:04 - okay whenever you are doing something
88:07 - like for example
88:08 - let's say padding right whenever they do
88:10 - that for example right i'm like ah
88:12 - trouble trouble trouble okay
88:15 - let's go back to now b
88:18 - ah let's go back to here uh freeze
88:22 - okay so let me type in again one more
88:24 - time here i will say trouble
88:27 - trouble okay all right that's what you
88:29 - always get into
88:30 - yes yeah i know i know that's just me so
88:33 - this right here means
88:34 - t t for top r for right
88:37 - b for bottom alpha left so you can see t
88:40 - six pixels t you see 32 is the right
88:45 - six pixels is bottom eight
88:48 - is left this is how we remember these
88:50 - short
88:51 - cuts like how cool is that trouble just
88:54 - keep that in mind
88:55 - trouble i get in trouble you get in
88:56 - trouble right and so whenever you do
88:58 - shortcuts
89:00 - top right bottom left it's as simple as
89:03 - that guys honestly and that's pretty
89:04 - cool
89:05 - i'll say top right over under yeah
89:08 - bottom
89:09 - left empty yeah i know so that why the
89:12 - break gives us a border
89:14 - uh a padding so you can see it creates a
89:16 - padding next up let's go ahead and
89:17 - actually add a border radius to give it
89:19 - some a little more concave looks like
89:20 - border radius
89:22 - is going to be in this case 50 pixels
89:24 - boom boom
89:26 - save that you see hey beautiful that
89:28 - looks great okay
89:29 - all right awesome then we're going to do
89:32 - is let's add a box shadow
89:33 - now the back shadow is going to be it's
89:35 - going to look a little bit like this
89:36 - box shadow and i'm going to copy from
89:39 - over here because we took it it took us
89:40 - a while to figure this box shadow out
89:42 - so we'll just do back shut up with this
89:44 - one right there
89:45 - so look at this so zero one pixels two
89:48 - pixels
89:49 - zero rgba 60 blah blah 64 67 0.302
89:54 - zero one pixels three pixels one pixels
89:56 - rgba 60 64 67 0.149
90:00 - okay i i think remember that i hope you
90:02 - remember that
90:03 - remember that in your head right now
90:04 - just you have to memorize it okay
90:07 - just around that remember everything
90:08 - okay no i screw
90:11 - i scrolled this for you so hopefully you
90:12 - can actually see it uh
90:14 - when you go ahead and copy this for
90:15 - yourself okay awesome
90:17 - so that's going to be the box shadow i
90:19 - would just i would just drop it once
90:21 - again
90:21 - in the in the chat because it's pretty
90:23 - hard to yeah
90:26 - okay sweet sweet sweet treat somebody
90:29 - said trouble a nice way to remember yes
90:30 - exactly very nice way
90:32 - awesome so we got that portion let's now
90:34 - go ahead and go in the second portion
90:36 - and that's going to be i'm going to
90:37 - define now a uh what am i going to find
90:39 - i'm going to define now
90:41 - a cursor so i'm going to say cursor
90:44 - reverse cursor i'm going to say pointer
90:47 - that means that when i hover over
90:49 - something it will be like a cursor so
90:51 - you can see here that's a cursor that
90:52 - becomes like a cursor awesome
90:54 - nice i like that okay all right next up
90:57 - i want to go ahead
90:58 - i'm not sure are you sure it's with auto
91:01 - because i feel like the width should be
91:02 - yeah smaller width it is with auto
91:04 - because we will add the padding
91:06 - afterwards ah
91:09 - okay ah okay cool huh okay one thing i
91:12 - want to do though
91:13 - is for this specific portion for our app
91:16 - i want to do a few things i want to
91:17 - change this
91:18 - color to maybe maybe be more grayish and
91:20 - i want to change the
91:21 - the font size here if i look at the font
91:24 - size let's go inspect element here
91:26 - okay this is original gmail here you can
91:28 - see
91:29 - div let's go get the tier compose
91:32 - okay so here's the div you can see in
91:34 - this div this is the box shadow by the
91:36 - way this is how this is how we got the
91:37 - box shadow just so you know
91:38 - we literally just copied it okay and
91:40 - then the font size is this one so font
91:42 - size
91:42 - 0.875 letters spacing 0.25 and we will
91:45 - do that exactly exactly here
91:47 - and the color is going to be this one so
91:48 - i'm going to say color
91:50 - let's go color ah come on i'm going to
91:54 - copy this come on there we go
91:56 - i'm going to say color it's gonna be
91:58 - this one
92:00 - so save that next up i'm gonna say font
92:02 - weight font weight of this specific
92:04 - thing is gonna
92:04 - font weight is going to be 500
92:09 - nice and then we're going to give it
92:11 - okay that's pretty good that's pretty
92:12 - good
92:13 - and then we're going to give it a font
92:14 - size font dash size
92:18 - let's give it what 0.875
92:24 - i don't even see
92:29 - what what okay if we go direct app
92:32 - real rem okay so dang
92:37 - does that did it change the color or no
92:38 - cool
92:40 - i mean it probably did not but it's like
92:43 - so close to
92:44 - yeah anyways let's remove this back of
92:46 - color orange which is hideous
92:48 - remove that i don't need that anymore
92:50 - hey
92:51 - i mean that looks pretty good i will say
92:52 - that looks pretty damn good i don't know
92:54 - you know that's pretty good so cool we
92:56 - got the composition
92:57 - we will go ahead and modify
93:00 - in a second now whenever you hover over
93:03 - you see how it has like this box
93:04 - whenever you hover over you see this
93:05 - right here oh that's not composing
93:07 - anything right now
93:08 - now hover over this to make that work
93:10 - here's what we're going to do
93:11 - we're going to do and this is another
93:13 - cool thing that you have inside
93:15 - style components you can actually define
93:17 - a hover so i can say hover
93:19 - for example hover right there i can say
93:22 - hover
93:22 - right there and then on the hover all i
93:25 - will say at this point
93:26 - is going to be we're going to alice do
93:28 - we change the padding no we don't need
93:30 - to change
93:30 - on the hover we now simply change the
93:33 - box shadow so let's think about this
93:35 - if i hover let's if we write right click
93:37 - and smack down on this one
93:38 - inspect that one and this one is the
93:40 - button right here see this is the whole
93:41 - button right here
93:43 - i'm going to say for state hover okay
93:46 - so that's not good that does not work
93:48 - out inside instead i'm going to say for
93:50 - stay hover on this one look at that and
93:53 - so you can see on hover
93:55 - here's what we have look at that right
93:56 - there just pay attention to this one
93:58 - we literally just got this from from
94:01 - google itself so
94:03 - sorry google we just copied you i mean
94:05 - you know you put it out there for people
94:06 - to see so
94:07 - there's nothing you can do about that
94:10 - so look here's what we'll do i will
94:12 - literally copy this box shadow that we
94:14 - have
94:15 - right there this box shadow and i'm
94:17 - gonna say on the hover i'm gonna say box
94:18 - shadow
94:20 - shadow and hopefully you can copy this
94:22 - for them in the comments for them to put
94:24 - in the comments
94:25 - just oh yeah sure sure sure okay and
94:27 - then what's going to happen is
94:29 - after that one we're going to also
94:30 - define the background color so here
94:32 - background color can be this one so boom
94:35 - so i'm gonna say called background color
94:38 - background dash color
94:39 - dash dash color this right there
94:43 - right there beautiful awesome cool so we
94:45 - have that background color is going to
94:46 - be this one
94:47 - next up let's add a small transition
94:48 - look at this transition it looks fancy
94:50 - as hell
94:51 - oh there should i see this transition uh
94:54 - what i'm talking what am i talking about
94:55 - by the way
94:55 - the transition i'm talking about is
94:56 - going to be this one right there boom
94:58 - so transition and this transition i'm
95:00 - going to put the answer
95:02 - in the wrapper itself so transition
95:05 - boom hey look at that see and we're
95:08 - transitioning the box
95:09 - shadow i know it's cool right

98:32 - the best that's all i can say to you
98:35 - oh my gosh you guys are the best 900
98:37 - likes that's
98:38 - 908 now okay all right take the reigns
98:43 - david okay so
98:47 - let's quickly in five minutes uh let's
98:49 - do the following so
98:50 - what we will do is we will go into the
98:52 - components folder create a brand new
98:55 - folder which we will call data because
98:58 - once again i'm not going to type out all
99:00 - those icons instead
99:01 - we will use something clever there so
99:06 - going inside of the data
99:09 - we will create a file which we will call
99:12 - uh
99:13 - side whoa whoa side bar
99:17 - button items dot js right that's nice
99:21 - now this is not going to be a
99:24 - react component because this is just
99:27 - going to contain
99:28 - all the data and all the icons that we
99:31 - have
99:32 - so first thing first let's import
99:35 - all the icons that we will need so we
99:37 - will need the inbox icon from material
99:40 - ui icon the star icon watch later
99:43 - send insert drive file icon
99:47 - label icon and the expand more icons and
99:50 - what we will do here is basically just
99:52 - create a
99:53 - json that we will export right away good
99:56 - nice so we say export
100:00 - const and we will say sidebar
100:04 - button items equals and this will
100:08 - be an array and inside of that array we
100:11 - will have an
100:12 - icon right yes so the first one is going
100:16 - to be the inbox
100:17 - icon and we will just close it out and
100:20 - we will just pretty much
100:21 - throw in uh those
100:24 - what you say uh components right yeah
100:27 - and again guys the reason why we're
100:28 - doing what's gonna stop is because you
100:29 - see this
100:30 - icons right here we're not going to
100:31 - about to type this at 1.1 we're going to
100:33 - create the data for it right here
100:35 - and then i'm going to import that and
100:37 - loop through every single icon
100:38 - and simply just display it just like
100:40 - this that's kind of the goal here just
100:41 - so you know okay
100:42 - that's how you want to do you want to be
100:43 - efficient with your code
100:46 - okay exactly it's one of the biggest
100:47 - things people see look look for when
100:48 - they
100:49 - hire you exactly
100:52 - yeah exactly and like everybody is like
100:55 - looking for that so even when i uh
100:58 - when i interviewed for other companies i
101:00 - was given these kind of stuff like
101:02 - yep i just had to make code much more
101:05 - optimized
101:06 - yes so next up
101:09 - uh we will just pretty much place all
101:12 - these stuff here so we will have the
101:14 - star
101:14 - icon and i'm actually so glad that
101:18 - they didn't hire me star icon
101:21 - that was gonna have the watch later icon
101:23 - or the the watch icon yeah that's gonna
101:25 - see
101:26 - that we have the sentence
101:33 - [Music]
101:39 - we will have the send icon next up
101:42 - insert drive oh boy that's here let's go
101:46 - here
101:47 - come on i'm messing it up come on you
101:49 - got this come on
101:50 - nice nice we will have the label
101:54 - label expand more boom
101:58 - cool all right and so watch later
102:02 - icon is going to be the snooze
102:05 - item and then we will have the drafts
102:09 - so if you think about this right this is
102:11 - going to define the icon for us right so
102:12 - this is going to define the icon when we
102:14 - loop to this this is going to define the
102:15 - icon
102:15 - which is going to be here right and then
102:17 - the text is just going to be defined the
102:19 - text so which is going to be here right
102:20 - exactly so we loop with this all we
102:22 - simply say we loop through it and then
102:23 - we simply display it
102:25 - based on what we get from the data
102:26 - pretty simple
102:28 - exactly and now like that's pretty much
102:31 - the data of those icons that we see
102:34 - there so yes
102:35 - going back to our sidebar the js file
102:40 - what we will do is we will do an inline
102:42 - javascript because jsx can do it because
102:44 - it's so powerful
102:45 - yes and first thing first uh we
102:48 - obviously want to go ahead and
102:50 - import the sidebar button
102:53 - icons or items yes so currently
102:57 - the sidebar button items but what we
102:59 - need to do is let's go back to sidebar
103:01 - okay
103:02 - let's go back to sidebar right here
103:03 - stop.js and we need to import those side
103:05 - those uh
103:06 - those uh the data right sidebar about
103:08 - this data and we'll do that by simply
103:10 - just going to here
103:11 - you can see here when we go ahead and do
103:14 - that
103:14 - i see sidebar item items so if i go
103:17 - ahead and go ahead and
103:18 - close this out sidebar item so we import
103:20 - sidebar buttons items oops no it's not
103:23 - right items
103:24 - from right from what from
103:27 - what from you see here data
103:30 - sidebar button items it's simple just as
103:33 - that and again
103:33 - this right here means we're going up two
103:35 - levels right so i'm gonna go up up
103:36 - up up up right to get the data simple as
103:39 - that okay
103:40 - cool exactly and why are we going to up
103:42 - on that pop-up
103:43 - because if we look at we look right now
103:45 - we are currently inside
103:47 - which we're currently where where is it
103:50 - it should be in data source data so we
103:52 - need to go up to data oh yeah
103:54 - then from data we need to go back to a
103:56 - biscuit no we need to go off from
103:58 - sidebar
103:59 - from cyber go you need to go no no first
104:01 - you need to go out from layout then you
104:03 - need to go out from components
104:05 - source this is one out good and then
104:08 - grab it
104:09 - then we go another out to go to
104:10 - components you see
104:12 - therefore components we're going to go
104:13 - into data right and that's kind of how
104:15 - that works right there and go to data
104:16 - right yes right there that's all
104:18 - we're doing like that way and now
104:22 - here here comes the cool part so now
104:23 - what we will do is we will just go ahead
104:25 - and say
104:26 - side uh sidebar button items
104:30 - and we will just go ahead and map
104:31 - through it and we will have
104:34 - single items in here right nice and
104:37 - once we have those items i just want to
104:40 - have a new div which i will call
104:44 - sidebar button item right and
104:48 - in this case uh and yeah yeah yeah okay
104:52 - yeah cool
104:53 - yeah so we will have the sidebar button
104:55 - item yes
104:57 - right yes and for that i will get uh
105:00 - throw in the item dot
105:02 - icon good then add the space
105:05 - and the i oh so item dot
105:08 - text text and again how does that work
105:10 - out because we're going to loop through
105:12 - this array cyber button items which
105:14 - comes again comes from
105:16 - here you see a sidebar button items okay
105:18 - so everything is going to be and
105:19 - everything every single item is going to
105:20 - be an object you can see here
105:22 - and then we have icon and text you see
105:24 - that's pretty much it and then we look
105:25 - through it when we use it
105:26 - we're going to say item ah
105:31 - going to say right there we're going to
105:33 - look through it i'm going to say okay
105:35 - map through or loop through the button
105:36 - items for every single item
105:38 - i'm going to find a sidebar button item
105:40 - which is which
105:41 - david is creating below and then from
105:44 - that we're going to use item the icon
105:46 - just how we defined before and and that
105:49 - text
105:49 - simple very simple right and he just
105:51 - created right here if you scroll to the
105:52 - bottom
105:53 - he just created a buttons wait where did
105:55 - you create it
105:56 - 47 right there line 47 sidebar button
105:59 - item
106:00 - that's pretty much it and then that's we
106:01 - could define the actual button we want
106:03 - to use
106:03 - okay let's go continue let's take a look
106:06 - at the react app by the way so let's go
106:07 - do this i'm going to say save this
106:09 - okay let's go rectangles
106:18 - 929 likes can we get to a thousand likes
106:21 - i think we can 929 likes can we get to a
106:24 - thousand likes i know
106:26 - hundred percent and we can do that guys
106:28 - all right to a thousand likes come on
106:30 - we got this oh oh oh
106:33 - okay all right next up what's next
106:36 - david uh it's 10 33 by the way that's
106:40 - fine keep going keep going
106:42 - okay okay so now what we will do is uh
106:46 - let's actually go ahead and make sure
106:48 - that these
106:50 - like so far things are looking good but
106:52 - we just want to make them look nicer
106:55 - so first up we will go into the
106:58 - wrapper and we will say that that will
107:01 - have
107:02 - a border uh right
107:05 - and we will say it will be one pixel
107:07 - solid
107:08 - and it will be light gray nice
107:12 - okay right ray like that cool
107:16 - and we will we just want to make sure
107:20 - that it actually takes up the whole page
107:22 - so we will say
107:23 - it will get a height of a 100 view
107:26 - height okay
107:27 - nice and that will be pretty much what
107:29 - we directly
107:31 - give to the rapper now
107:35 - here this div right here and it has a
107:36 - border right it's pretty simple and the
107:38 - 100 height of 100 bh just simply means
107:40 - that it will expand
107:42 - to the height of 100 100 vh that's
107:44 - pretty much it that's all it means
107:45 - yeah that would pretty much just use all
107:47 - the yes on the screen yes correct that's
107:49 - it that's
107:49 - awesome yeah and next up we will go into
107:53 - compose wrapper
107:54 - and that will use display grid
107:58 - of course nice and we will say place
108:01 - dash items
108:06 - and we will go and say start what's up
108:08 - okay let's get closer
108:09 - right here just you know so basically
108:10 - start meaning oh look at that that's
108:12 - cool
108:12 - nice i like it cool so that basically
108:14 - right away put it in the start i love it
108:16 - okay keep going keep going
108:19 - and now we will add a little bit of
108:21 - padding
108:22 - nice and i want to say that above and
108:25 - below i want to give it 10
108:27 - pixels and on both sides i want to give
108:30 - it 20 pixels so this means right here
108:32 - this is top and bottom so this is
108:33 - another stroke i guess you guys can
108:35 - remember okay
108:36 - this right here if you do if you specify
108:38 - two items
108:39 - this means top and bottom this means
108:41 - left and right so think about
108:42 - vertical horizontal vertical horizontal
108:45 - vertical horizontal just keep that in
108:46 - mind okay
108:47 - that's pretty much it yeah vh
108:50 - vh i actually learned that
108:54 - like what happens if you uh fall off
108:57 - a skyscraper right yeah you go top to
109:00 - bottom
109:01 - and then you lay down okay i like it you
109:04 - go tuck the button kneeling down
109:06 - that is one way to think about this when
109:08 - you fall off a skyscraper nice job
109:10 - i mean did i remember it or did i
109:12 - remember it i guess you did
109:15 - nice i like it yeah look at that our
109:17 - button right here is pretty good it
109:18 - looks very clean it looks very stylized
109:20 - i like it awesome keep going
109:22 - all right so uh we will pretty much
109:25 - leave out the side buttons
109:26 - wrapper it's just going to be uh
109:30 - the one again that we just have and
109:32 - we're just not going to touch that
109:34 - so we will move on to sidebar button
109:36 - item
109:38 - and for that we will do a few different
109:41 - things so
109:42 - we will say it will obviously have
109:44 - display
109:46 - of grid like that
109:49 - and we will say grid template
109:53 - and it will yeah like columns nice
109:57 - and we will have a 14 px no 14
110:01 - and then auto is going to be the left
110:04 - the right hand side so basically we will
110:06 - give 14
110:07 - to the icon and the rest is going to be
110:10 - filled
110:10 - up with old text so that's what that so
110:12 - that means that this 14
110:14 - right here is basically the cut is going
110:15 - to be the icon and then
110:17 - yes the auto is going to oh okay that
110:19 - makes sense okay the audio is going to
110:20 - be
110:20 - gotcha gotcha gotcha gotcha okay cool
110:22 - cool gotcha now
110:24 - uh we will use a color of gray
110:28 - in this case for both the icon and
110:31 - the text as well i i tried to keep it
110:34 - simple so i was just like okay let's go
110:36 - with gray
110:39 - and by the way speaking of gray our
110:42 - student
110:42 - devin gray got a job at paypal
110:47 - let's go you're seeing the problem
110:49 - because again linking by if you guys are
110:51 - interested link in bio
110:52 - pwg the best course on the planet uh for
110:55 - javascript to become a javascript
110:57 - developer that's pretty much it i ain't
110:58 - got to say anything else it's just the
111:00 - best
111:00 - because we did it we made it and it's so
111:02 - good
111:03 - exactly exactly all right
111:07 - it was like an ltt yeah yeah yeah yeah
111:09 - ltt plugin okay
111:11 - so we would say uh padding
111:14 - uh five pixel and then we will give it a
111:18 - 25 pixels so
111:19 - 5 pixel above and below and 25 on both
111:22 - sides
111:23 - and it would just make that uh spacing
111:27 - look so much nicer and i think if you
111:29 - refresh or save
111:30 - it will actually apply hey look how
111:33 - beautiful that looks
111:34 - oh my god that looks so sexy whoo let's
111:37 - go
111:39 - ah that's good awesome and so that my
111:42 - friend is the sidebar
111:44 - item component now is that pretty much
111:45 - it for the sidebar just so i know right
111:48 - let's do it however let's do a hug
111:52 - we have two more little things just for
111:54 - these icons let's do it let's do it so
111:56 - one of them is going to be invisible
111:58 - for a little but we will say we will
112:01 - give it a border radius
112:03 - okay and then guys you have to trust the
112:06 - reason well here's like
112:07 - the reason why we do that is because
112:08 - when we go hover hover over this you see
112:10 - look at this
112:10 - you can keep tapping keep typing when we
112:12 - hover to see how it has this
112:14 - this like um this like border radius on
112:16 - the right right hand side you see that
112:17 - right there
112:18 - that's why because when we hover this
112:19 - and we need to add a border radius to it
112:21 - just
112:22 - as simple as that okay
112:25 - exactly exactly exactly and
112:29 - yeah so what happens is uh we will give
112:31 - it a border radius of zero one hundred
112:33 - percent wick so one hundred pixel one
112:35 - and zero again and it's going from
112:37 - corner to corner uh
112:38 - top left top left top right bottom right
112:41 - beautiful
112:42 - and then bottom left and then we will
112:44 - give a
112:45 - uh in case we hover over it we will say
112:48 - we will
112:48 - go ahead and say background color
112:52 - and that is going to be a hashtag
112:56 - f5 f7 f7
113:00 - and that's like a little grayish
113:02 - something and if you go ahead and save
113:03 - it
113:04 - i think it should show up
113:07 - yeah okay let's go ahead and save that
113:08 - let me see save that okay
113:11 - okay so okay so oh look at that
113:15 - oh that looks so good look at this guys
113:18 - those little details make quite a
113:20 - difference is that a crystal pointer
113:21 - let's go to cursor points that way when
113:22 - we go ahead and actually hover over this
113:26 - gonna be pointer now pointer oh right
113:30 - there
113:30 - all right let's go ahead and refresh
113:32 - that okay oh
113:34 - that looks so good look at that maybe
113:36 - let's add it should we add a small
113:38 - margin to it just so that because like
113:39 - you can see here it doesn't touch
113:42 - it has like a margin to you see that it
113:43 - doesn't touch the
113:45 - right hand portion so let's do a margin
113:47 - right margin right
113:49 - margin right and like two pixels let's
113:51 - do much right now
113:53 - do we go by eight so let's go let's go
113:54 - four pixels first let's go fir
113:56 - four let's just say big numbers
114:00 - let's do eight pixels now eight pixels
114:02 - um
114:04 - oh that looks so good you guys look at
114:07 - that
114:08 - so good that is what i'm talking about
