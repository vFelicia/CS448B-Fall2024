00:00 - hey guys what's up this is Kazi from
00:02 - clever programmer calm and as you can
00:05 - probably tell we're trying out something
00:07 - new here in this video we're going to
00:10 - cover is we're going to teach you how
00:11 - you go about building apps but before
00:13 - you get to that level you need to know
00:16 - how you can actually think logically
00:20 - about creating those apps once you get
00:21 - those logical skills up something I
00:23 - cover in my free course if you guys are
00:25 - in it we're going to be doing coding
00:27 - challenges on Python okay
00:29 - this is what's going to allow you so
00:31 - then when you are creating those web
00:32 - apps that I'm going to be teaching you
00:34 - guys in my olp course you're ready for
00:37 - them and ready to go okay so let's get
00:38 - our coding challenge started so I'm on
00:40 - this website called hour of Python and
00:42 - we're just going to do some coding
00:44 - challenges live and we'll see how it
00:46 - goes
00:46 - the first thing I see is it says string
00:49 - challenges and we're just going to hit
00:52 - and open it up so let's say we go to
00:54 - lowercase challenge okay and what I'll
00:57 - do for you guys so you guys can try
00:59 - these challenges as well I'll put it
01:01 - right below this video so you can
01:03 - actually code in here and give it a try
01:06 - alright so this one is pretty simple if
01:10 - I gave you any string just give you a
01:12 - lowercase version of it so let's say I
01:14 - gave you hello in all caps if you call
01:18 - what we call a goal function on it it
01:20 - should just turn it all lower case okay
01:23 - so let's give that a try all right so I
01:28 - go to my line 11 I don't know if I'm
01:32 - playing I'm probably planning wrong
01:34 - because I'm just trying out we're trying
01:36 - out this new thing but let's let's give
01:37 - it a try and one method and python that
01:41 - I remember is lower so that makes our
01:45 - life very simple we get a string we call
01:48 - our lower method on it and that just
01:50 - makes it lowercase so let's run this and
01:53 - give it a try
01:59 - and as you can see we were given capital
02:03 - art and Capital trinket but what it spit
02:07 - out is lowercase Targ and lowercase
02:10 - trinket so fantastic we did a great job
02:14 - there let's move on to the next
02:16 - challenge the next challenge is
02:18 - uppercase so what if we're given
02:20 - anything that's lowercase or any
02:22 - different case we want to just return it
02:23 - in uppercase for example let's say
02:26 - you're making a blogging website and you
02:29 - want to show the title in upper case no
02:31 - matter how the user puts it so let's say
02:33 - that you have somebody on your website a
02:35 - user that logs in and then creates a new
02:38 - title what if we want that title to
02:40 - always be lowercase even though the user
02:41 - might have put it in the lower case well
02:43 - that's where this challenge will help
02:46 - you in Python so then we're building
02:48 - those bigger apps you have the tools and
02:50 - strategies when you need them okay so
02:53 - let's go ahead and give it a try
02:55 - upper case is very simple it's just like
02:58 - what we did previously we can make it
03:00 - more complicated but we're going to do
03:02 - similar things so as you can see they
03:03 - have written some of the code for us it
03:05 - says define uppercase string so we're
03:09 - getting--we're called creating a
03:11 - function called uppercase it takes in
03:13 - some string and then on line eleven we
03:15 - can do something similar and we can say
03:17 - dot upper okay that's again a method in
03:20 - Python so if we're given lowercase Arg
03:23 - and the lowercase trinket it should
03:25 - actually print it all in caps so let's
03:28 - give that a try boom works perfectly and
03:32 - in the next video we're going to cover a
03:35 - new challenge called switch-case
03:37 - challenge that one is a little bit
03:39 - trickier but I want you guys to give
03:42 - that a try that's it for this video I
03:44 - love you guys so much and as always I'll
03:47 - see you in the next video
