00:00 - what about learning Python the hard way
00:01 - yeah puck that is a good book I am
00:05 - a fan of this to be honest because it
00:07 - goes through like building actual
00:09 - projects - I mean learn Python the hard
00:11 - way does as well but I'm a fan of I
00:14 - don't know I'm just a fan of this you
00:16 - create these games and stuff and I like
00:18 - it you know I kind of nerd out on this
00:20 - book a little bit you create like tennis
00:23 - simulations and here's just a rule of
00:27 - thumb with books I talked with my good
00:29 - friend Ben marks he works at Google and
00:32 - he writes code and Python every single
00:34 - day and he was telling me that when you
00:38 - are using Python or sorry when you are
00:40 - learning coding and you're trying to
00:42 - learn it from a book one of the best
00:44 - things to do is just go to a book with a
00:47 - lot of exercise and my friend um Jude
00:49 - said the same thing okay um Jude is one
00:51 - of the founding engineers at code
00:52 - Academy and if any of you guys have used
00:54 - repple it or have seen me use repli'd
00:57 - repl i.t um Jude was the founder of it
01:02 - okay so um Jude also says find books
01:05 - that just have a lot of exercises in
01:07 - them so if you're gonna get a Python or
01:10 - coding book just pick it up and just go
01:12 - through it and just see how many
01:14 - exercises it has and if it looks like
01:16 - you're working on a lot of hands-on
01:18 - exercises and projects then you're in a
01:21 - good place
