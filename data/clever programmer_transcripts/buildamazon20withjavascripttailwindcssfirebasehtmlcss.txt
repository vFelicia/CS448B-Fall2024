04:16 - be amazon
04:18 - amazon 2.0
04:21 - we'll call it a better version of amazon
04:23 - because that's how we do it
04:25 - okay and then honestly that is it
04:28 - right so once we've gone that let's go

04:50 - there's a few ways if you go to your
04:52 - extensions you should have an extension
04:53 - called live
04:54 - server so if you go to live server
04:57 - right go to this extension click install
04:59 - and that's it
05:00 - if you don't have this just right click
05:02 - and do open
05:03 - and um what's it called copy path just
05:07 - do copy path and then you can paste it
05:08 - into your actual
05:10 - path uh here on chrome okay
05:13 - but let's go ahead and do right click
05:16 - open with live server
05:20 - right there beautiful so now we will
05:23 - have our live server
05:24 - and you can see right there it says this
05:26 - is amazon 2.0
05:28 - you guys with me yes or no you guys with
05:30 - me yeah i see all you beautiful
05:33 - by the way just to really heads up if
05:34 - you are not able to keep up don't worry
05:36 - you can always rewatch this video
05:37 - multiple times
05:39 - you know so don't be so worried about
05:40 - that okay that's all i'll tell you
05:43 - and this is mainly like for viewing
05:45 - purposes to give you some good
05:46 - perspective on what is possible
05:48 - with cranes until this and then of
05:50 - course you can always go back and
05:51 - rewatch this one more time
05:53 - all right amazon 2.0 let's go ahead and
05:55 - right click and then we'll do new file
05:57 - as well and we're going to create
05:58 - style.css
06:01 - okay just like that all right this is
06:04 - where
06:04 - the styling for our amazon clone is
06:08 - going to be
06:09 - okay nice and then what's going to
06:11 - happen now at this point is the
06:12 - following
06:13 - we need to import a few different things
06:16 - to make sure everything is working
06:17 - properly all right
06:18 - so what are those things i need to
06:20 - import jesse what do you think
06:25 - well we want to work with tailwind of
06:27 - course that's right
06:28 - so in order to work with you know
06:31 - something like tailwind and if you've
06:33 - never worked with that before
06:35 - what you do is going to look up to wind
06:37 - in google
06:38 - so let's go ahead and do that so let's
06:40 - go ahead and go to
06:42 - tailwind
06:45 - and what you want to look up guys it's
06:47 - always the documentation
06:49 - so here they have documentation indeed
06:52 - or you can go to get started
06:55 - start learning right there and right
06:57 - away at the bottom
06:58 - you see it tells you exactly what you
07:00 - need to do in order to install
07:02 - and there's multiple ways to install
07:03 - your tail and css
07:05 - but but let's talk about the easiest way
07:08 - for us to do it just temporarily
07:10 - and that's through a cdn which is
07:12 - basically just through a link so if i
07:13 - just keep going down
07:14 - and down and down and done see using tim
07:17 - what's your cd envious at the end
07:19 - now i don't fully recommend it if you're
07:20 - going to build it with a lot of projects
07:22 - but for a starter project it's amazing
07:24 - so
07:25 - just right click on this or just go
07:27 - ahead and copy this right here
07:28 - and honestly you're pretty good so if i
07:30 - come and see this
07:31 - i will put you put it for you guys in
07:33 - the chat so you guys have it as well
07:34 - let me go ahead and put that for you
07:35 - guys in the chat and then a monit if you
07:38 - can actually put that in the chat
07:39 - for youtube that would be amazing thank
07:41 - you very much uh
07:43 - that'll mean a lot okay so this is going
07:45 - to be your link now
07:46 - some of you might ask the question of
07:48 - what is telling css right
07:50 - what is tailwind css a great question
07:53 - anybody know what 101 css is raise your
07:55 - hands raise your hands
07:58 - okay who has no idea what telling css is
08:00 - raise your hands
08:02 - there we go a lot more hands raised
08:06 - good question so taylor and css is a css
08:10 - framework anybody know here bootstrap
08:13 - bootstrap right a lot of you guys know
08:14 - bootstrap so it's kind of like booster
08:16 - but
08:17 - it's on a different scale right so it's
08:20 - uh as i said here it's a utility first
08:22 - css framework
08:23 - packed with classes like flex i know pt
08:26 - 4 text center and rotate so basically
08:30 - um to give you an a simple rundown
08:33 - what bootstrap is a lot of it's
08:34 - components so if i go to bootstrap for
08:36 - example here
08:38 - and this is just a really good one
08:39 - because i want you to understand exactly
08:40 - what you're getting into
08:42 - so that's why i'm explaining this to you
08:45 - so if we go to bootstrap you can see
08:47 - that if we just go to docs
08:49 - for example if i just go to docs right
08:51 - here right
08:53 - um and if i just go to layout or if i
08:55 - just do for example
08:56 - you know forms you know or let's just do
08:58 - buttons i'm going to search for buttons
09:00 - here
09:01 - right so bootstrap is very much you can
09:03 - see
09:04 - i can all i have to do is i have to do
09:06 - button button primary
09:07 - and that gives me the button right here
09:09 - you guys see that yeah
09:11 - right here you guys see that yes right
09:13 - so this
09:14 - already gives you predefined components
09:17 - right
09:18 - basically you just use this class and
09:20 - then you've got the component called
09:21 - button button
09:22 - primer that's it okay but with tail one
09:25 - it doesn't work out so much that way
09:27 - okay with tail instead of using for
09:29 - example buttons let me show you i'm
09:30 - gonna show you how exactly
09:31 - you would use it let me see here it's
09:34 - basically instead of using components
09:36 - you are actually breaking it down into
09:38 - smaller pieces
09:39 - you're actually breaking down into
09:40 - smaller pieces like for example width
09:42 - look at this you see you know color you
09:45 - can set specific background colors just
09:48 - using
09:48 - a very simple class like bg red bg
09:51 - yellow
09:52 - okay and so for example if you want to
09:54 - create a button in our case for example
09:55 - there's a button called play now
09:57 - let me see there's another button that
09:58 - we can use uh
10:00 - let's see for example like this button
10:02 - right here okay
10:04 - play now uh or buy now i bet by now
10:07 - where is it where's that button right
10:08 - here
10:08 - there's a button the butt button button
10:10 - button anybody see the button
10:13 - yeah yeah line 48 i think
10:17 - uh line 48 48
10:22 - no that's not the button 47 47 47 there
10:25 - we go so button for example you can see
10:27 - then instead of just for example in
10:29 - bootstrap all we do is we say hey
10:31 - button button primary that's all we say
10:34 - that's easy it's simple right do you
10:36 - like that by the way i like how it's
10:38 - simple right
10:38 - it's so super duper easy but without
10:42 - what telling css when i create a butt i
10:45 - say hey
10:45 - flex non flex item center just like
10:48 - content
10:49 - i give it a width i give the height look
10:50 - at this right it's pretty crazy
10:52 - then i say hey text purple so text
10:55 - purple 700
10:57 - background purple 50 right then i say
11:00 - bg purple rounded full to make give it a
11:03 - rounded circle
11:05 - with nine and height nine
11:08 - crazy right pretty crazy
11:13 - uh yeah it's kind of like but that's not
11:14 - the binder button hold on that's the add
11:16 - to back button
11:18 - this is the binder button right here my
11:19 - bad it's see text white bg purple 700
11:23 - rounded full you know item center so
11:26 - where do you see the big difference
11:28 - between bootstrap
11:30 - and tail and css where do you see the
11:33 - difference
11:34 - put in the chat i'm really curious what
11:36 - you guys have to say
11:38 - what do you see the difference between
11:39 - bootstrap and tailwind css
11:44 - that's right more control david that's
11:46 - right so in tail and css you have a lot
11:49 - more control
11:49 - a lot more freedom that's right maya
11:52 - that's right
11:53 - a lot more customizations right if i
11:56 - want to make this button maybe larger or
11:58 - smaller
11:59 - i just simply change you know the the
12:02 - width you see this width
12:03 - a half i'll just change the width if i
12:05 - wanted to
12:06 - that's right and that's it right instead
12:08 - of just having to be one thing that's
12:09 - the only thing you can use
12:11 - i can make it as customizable as i want
12:14 - and all that is by simply just adding a
12:16 - bunch of classes
12:18 - and all those classes are is they're
12:20 - just simply
12:21 - css classes underneath the hood their
12:24 - css attributes
12:25 - so if this width one and for example
12:28 - if you think about it this width half
12:31 - what do you think this
12:32 - actually converts to w you know
12:35 - one dash two
12:38 - under css what do you think converts
12:40 - well it converts to the following
12:42 - with here i'm gonna show it to you
12:46 - yes with fifty percent that's correct
12:49 - that's right that's it that's all it is
12:51 - underneath the hood
12:53 - okay so i just want you to understand
12:55 - that portion okay very poor
12:57 - very important and so basically anything
12:59 - that you are going to use in taylor css
13:01 - is just going to be that so if i want to
13:03 - for example
13:04 - if i want to give it uh do a background
13:06 - color i do search and say background
13:08 - color
13:12 - color right i hit enter and then right
13:15 - away this
13:16 - shows me exactly what i need to use and
13:18 - here are the options i have for
13:20 - background colors
13:21 - blue you know violets you know blue
13:24 - green orange yellow and i just simply
13:27 - say hey
13:27 - bg gray 500 that's it guys
13:31 - that's it so let's take an example
13:34 - if i want to go ahead and have this text
13:38 - i'm going to say div here okay
13:42 - command x command v and i say div
13:45 - class what class would i use to give
13:48 - this
13:49 - a different color of let's say blue
13:52 - tell me i want everybody by the way
13:54 - everybody right now on zoom and if
13:55 - you're on youtube you should be on tail
13:57 - and css documentation right now
13:59 - every single person you guys should have
14:00 - that open because that's how this is
14:02 - going to happen okay
14:03 - so if i want for example color
14:06 - right like a text color
14:11 - boom right there and this gives me all
14:12 - the colors i can have
14:14 - so if i want to text color green which
14:16 - kind of looks like this
14:17 - i do text screen 600 command c
14:21 - i do command v right here and then look
14:24 - at this
14:25 - i go to my amazon 2.0 and then what does
14:28 - it look like
14:29 - this is green simple right
14:32 - right but right if i right click on it
14:36 - and i inspect it what it actually is
14:40 - let me show you here's my inspect
14:43 - element
14:44 - if i actually inspect it what it is
14:48 - oh a class see it's a class type screen
14:51 - is simply color
14:52 - rgba with a specific you know opacity
14:56 - if you have my friends is it it's
14:58 - nothing crazy whatsoever
15:01 - nothing crazy whatsoever so
15:04 - did i give you just a just like a little
15:07 - really like a really quick tour of what
15:08 - talent css is did you guys
15:10 - get a better understanding of that by
15:12 - the way is that better
15:14 - is that better i get a thumbs up i get a
15:16 - thumbs up from a few people
15:18 - nice beautiful okay great so that is
15:20 - what telemachus says it's a framework
15:22 - that allows you to customize
15:23 - your uh your colors your
15:26 - buttons a lot more than like a booster
15:29 - would allow you normally
15:30 - all right so let's go and get this
15:33 - started in that case so if i have this
15:34 - all right let's now think about what we
15:36 - need to do with our amazon 2.0 here's
15:39 - what
15:40 - it looks like right now here it is um
15:43 - pretty cool
15:44 - so let's think about what are some
15:46 - components
15:47 - we need to build in order to make this
15:51 - right
15:52 - i always like to divide my projects into
15:54 - small components
15:56 - right i want you guys to tell me in the
15:57 - chat what are some components that you
15:59 - see right there
16:00 - michael okay i see it so navigation bar
16:03 - that's right so the nav bar right here
16:06 - that's right okay
16:07 - i like it what else do you guys see the
16:09 - sidebar
16:12 - that's right the sidebar right here what
16:14 - else do you guys see
16:17 - i'm not calling maurice the main section
16:19 - i'm gonna call it the main section
16:20 - right or maybe this is like the shopping
16:23 - section i don't know
16:24 - right we also have what we also have
16:26 - like this banner thing
16:28 - right the header this header or banner
16:31 - that was called
16:32 - we've got the categories section
16:36 - right here and then we also get the
16:38 - products the product section
16:40 - the products look so damn good by the
16:42 - way so damn good
16:44 - right the product section i know i know
16:47 - i know
16:47 - and of course if we look more even
16:49 - deeper we have for example the logo
16:52 - now what else what do we have that we
16:53 - have the search bar
16:56 - right and then we have a little few
16:57 - icons right here that
16:59 - you know that you can use as well right
17:00 - so uh yeah that's right search icon and
17:02 - so forth right that's right that's right
17:05 - okay great all right so if we know these
17:07 - are components
17:09 - what do we need to start with that in
17:10 - that case well
17:12 - we need to go ahead and start out with
17:13 - those components am i right no
17:15 - react here guys we're only going to use
17:17 - javascript unfortunately or not not
17:18 - unfortunately fortunately we will be
17:20 - using javascript just for this
17:22 - so you guys will learn how to use you
17:23 - know the the basics of javascript here
17:26 - all right so let's do this let's go and
17:30 - create our div right what is the first
17:32 - thing
17:32 - that we need to create well we need to
17:35 - create our what
17:36 - kind of the container right the main
17:38 - container
17:39 - that will contain all of this right
17:42 - first things first i want to do is i'm
17:44 - going to create a div
17:46 - diff right here and this div is going to
17:49 - be
17:50 - like a you know a full width div so this
17:52 - is going to be the containers i'm saying
17:53 - div class
17:54 - div right here that's the container i'm
17:57 - going to give it a
17:58 - full on background white so bg white
18:01 - class bg dash y and then again
18:05 - that's coming from directly tail and css
18:07 - okay and
18:08 - a width dash full how do we get that
18:11 - because if i go to 101 css
18:13 - and i say width for example width
18:18 - width and then i go simply to width you
18:21 - can see here
18:23 - that width full is width of 100 exactly
18:26 - see so that's what correlates to
18:27 - in in uh in my terms okay
18:31 - i love i love how you can look
18:33 - everything up
18:35 - inside of this documentation i know um
18:38 - so basically it's like these are utility
18:41 - classes
18:42 - so called utility classes and those are
18:44 - actually equal to
18:45 - your standard css properties but they
18:48 - have their own classes so they have
18:49 - their own unique name
18:51 - that sometimes also means when you're
18:53 - looking for a width
18:55 - of let's say 50 pixels or actually it's
18:57 - not 50 it's called something else
19:00 - um you can go scroll to the top does
19:03 - yeah right here like for three rem like
19:05 - four rem
19:06 - yeah exactly so it's a little bit
19:08 - different
19:09 - so that also means by the way guys if
19:11 - you would say um
19:13 - w dash of hyphen 17 that doesn't exist
19:17 - at class
19:18 - so make sure to always check whether
19:20 - your utility class the name really
19:22 - exists of it
19:24 - okay that's right and that's it nice can
19:26 - you live share with me
19:28 - oh that's right i forgot about that in
19:29 - your life sure so i'm gonna click
19:31 - share here with jessie so the jessica i
19:33 - love to coach you
19:34 - i know she likes to code as well love
19:38 - code guys i love code who else here
19:40 - loves code
19:41 - i mean i know that's why they're here
19:43 - yeah
19:44 - hopefully everybody that's how you guys
19:46 - are here okay i'm gonna send to you
19:48 - right now jessica one second here
19:50 - awesome okay okay
19:53 - it is sent done
19:57 - awesome yay all right so what we need to
20:00 - do we might need to prove it later yeah
20:01 - we'll improve in a second here
20:03 - so what we need to do first guys is we
20:04 - need to go ahead and actually create our
20:06 - header first so let's go ahead to hide
20:07 - this
20:08 - i'm going to say div class right here
20:11 - and i'm going to say header okay
20:12 - that's going to be our first progress
20:13 - remember we talked about first part is
20:15 - going to be
20:16 - the header okay header right there
20:19 - that's going to be the header right
20:21 - after we've got the header i'm going to
20:23 - accept with the right jess is trying to
20:24 - access into my vs code
20:26 - which you know i'm not going to let her
20:29 - um
20:29 - so we have the header and then what is
20:31 - the next thing that we we have for that
20:33 - i'm going to say the following we have a
20:35 - header and then we also have another div
20:37 - right here that's like this right
20:38 - it's the main section that contains the
20:40 - sidebar
20:42 - and the products section or whatever
20:44 - it's called right
20:45 - so i'm going to do day of class
20:50 - class equal to main okay now why am i
20:53 - calling the main
20:54 - these are just some terms i'm going to
20:56 - use myself because i want to reference
20:57 - them
20:58 - these mean nothing right now because
21:00 - they're not actually styled
21:01 - this is not telling css this is nothing
21:04 - this is just so we
21:05 - exactly know what these divs are for
21:07 - okay that's what the purpose is
21:09 - then inside the header what are the few
21:11 - sections that we have inside the header
21:13 - well
21:14 - the first section is we have the logo
21:16 - okay
21:17 - so let's go ahead and do this i'm going
21:18 - to say div
21:21 - class is equal to what logo
21:24 - again not telling css just for us to
21:26 - know exactly what's going on in this div
21:28 - okay and then after that we're going to
21:32 - have
21:32 - what we're going to have an input and
21:34 - then a few different other things
21:36 - but for that to happen oh jess are you
21:38 - in
21:40 - yeah yeah i'm it just isn't i'm in let's
21:42 - go beautiful
21:43 - okay good good good good so then what's
21:45 - gonna happen is
21:46 - we will go ahead and uh well say hello
21:51 - let's open this up hello beautiful but
21:54 - instead of hello we're also we're
21:55 - actually going to
21:56 - add an image so let's go into an image
21:59 - jesse okay
22:00 - and we'll say the following we'll say um
22:03 - image right and then no class no clashes
22:06 - here will say source
22:07 - is equal to the following right and i'm
22:09 - going to give you the source here that
22:11 - we have this is just an amazon uh
22:13 - amazon image let me give it to you right
22:15 - now
22:16 - oh oh right there i'm gonna copy this
22:21 - i'm going to give you guys in the chat
22:22 - so you guys have the link to that
22:26 - boom and then a month you can paste that
22:28 - please on youtube that'd be amazing too
22:31 - the youtube channel is not open yeah oh
22:34 - it's closed
22:36 - okay yeah yeah okay cool
22:39 - so we have that image if you just need
22:42 - an amazon a logo image just go ahead and
22:44 - search it up on
22:45 - line um but here's the image i'm going
22:48 - to show you right here this is the image
22:49 - right here see
22:50 - this is the image there's amazon 2.0
22:52 - amazon logo image
22:55 - okay and then so we've got that let's
22:57 - take a look at what we have so far
22:59 - i mean it's it's pretty basic it's like
23:02 - a
23:02 - view and that's pretty much it okay it's
23:04 - nothing much at all
23:05 - but i know i know i know i know well you
23:08 - can't see it now we
23:09 - the letters are white but because we
23:11 - have a white background
23:13 - the you're not gonna see it that's right
23:15 - that's right that's right okay
23:17 - if you wait if you would make the
23:18 - background bg
23:20 - for example purple or something or black
23:23 - so let me see we would be able to see
23:25 - the logo yeah
23:27 - oh you see right there see so yeah boom
23:30 - there we go
23:31 - vg white so that's where the logo is at
23:34 - guys and now
23:35 - we can also style this image so let's do
23:38 - that
23:39 - okay um
23:42 - i would personally um
23:46 - first make like an image put it in a
23:48 - container oh we already have a class
23:50 - logo
23:51 - plus logo that's right yeah yeah i think
23:53 - we need to write it
23:54 - like we're going to right now is give it
23:56 - a width and a height jesse okay
23:58 - so for the container let's give it a
24:00 - width okay so what is it with jesse
24:03 - uh with i would say like one-fifth okay
24:06 - and height
24:09 - uh of 16 okay now what this is yeah can
24:12 - we put a
24:12 - what does it actually mean can you put a
24:14 - word wrap can you put a word wrap on
24:16 - your
24:17 - code all right you guys want or toggle
24:19 - rap
24:20 - how do i do that you do
24:23 - view and then there's a word wrap
24:27 - you guys happy now guys happy now there
24:29 - we go
24:33 - there we go so we give it a width and a
24:36 - height and how does this again translate
24:37 - to because if you gotta go
24:38 - if you guys go to tail and css and if
24:40 - you simply just start search up with
24:42 - with right here right look at this right
24:45 - and we say width of one-fifth what does
24:47 - this mean
24:48 - if you go to one-fifth one-fifth just
24:50 - simply means with twenty percent that's
24:52 - all that means
24:53 - yeah nothing i think crazy and the
24:54 - height of sixteen if i search up height
24:56 - again here
24:59 - right this is how you literally you will
25:01 - use tail and css you will just go to
25:03 - documentation you search up anything you
25:04 - want so height 16
25:06 - is height of 4 rem okay and if you're
25:08 - wondering what rem means
25:09 - it's basically based on standard uh kind
25:12 - of
25:13 - pixel so for example if your body pixels
25:16 - is for example 16 pixels
25:18 - one rem is 16 pixels you see what i mean
25:21 - four rem is four times 16 pixels
25:24 - that's how so rem is like yeah it's like
25:27 - an equation almost
25:29 - right that's the fraction unit yeah
25:33 - that's right that's right
25:34 - so let's go continue on let's give it a
25:35 - background color as well i'm going to go
25:37 - to the header and i'll say bg grade is
25:39 - 900 so i'm going to say header
25:40 - and i'm going to say bg dash
25:44 - dash gray dash
25:48 - 900 boom save that boom so much better
25:51 - now
25:52 - so much better okay and then i'm going
25:55 - to give
25:55 - the header as well i'm going to give it
25:57 - a h of 16 so that we have the height
25:59 - as well nice okay and then honestly
26:03 - besides that nothing so nothing so far
26:05 - crazy i'm going to save that
26:06 - okay this is what we have now let's go
26:09 - back to our image class
26:11 - image and let's do class is equal to
26:14 - and we need to make sure our image is
26:16 - actually also specific within height so
26:18 - i'm going to say
26:19 - width width dash 28
26:23 - okay and then height each dash
26:27 - 16 okay so i don't want it to be bigger
26:30 - oh it just become became
26:31 - like a lot smaller right but that's okay
26:34 - right that's okay because we can use
26:37 - object contain
26:40 - like this to make sure the object is
26:42 - contained in there so what does object
26:44 - contain is
26:45 - if i go to otl and css and i simply
26:48 - search up object contain
26:50 - or i'm going to say um object fit right
26:53 - that's what
26:54 - it's actually called in css and sit here
26:56 - you see object contain the css class for
26:59 - that one is object
27:00 - contain right so you just simply
27:03 - whatever css property you know of you
27:05 - search it up and then that's the c
27:06 - class that you use all right so pretty
27:09 - good now at this point
27:11 - i'm lucky where we're going uh that's
27:13 - awesome let's do
27:14 - let's give it a margin so i'm gonna say
27:16 - margin
27:17 - ml dash ml dash
27:21 - 10. what do you think ml dash 10 means i
27:23 - want you guys to put in the chat
27:26 - what do you think that means
27:29 - that's right margin left that's right
27:31 - jason margin left so
27:33 - m stands for margin nice yeah l
27:36 - stands for left then 10 is just 10 rem i
27:39 - think it's just the 10 rem that's it
27:41 - let's go ahead and do that save that
27:46 - save that all right there you go now
27:49 - amazon is
27:49 - a little bit more to the left-hand side
27:51 - okay yeah looking
27:52 - looking looking really good guys by the
27:55 - way we're looking really really good i'm
27:56 - liking where we're going okay
27:58 - uh next up let's go ahead and do what
28:01 - we're going to create
28:02 - our input right jesse
28:05 - yeah but also maybe put the image do you
28:07 - think this is a little bit
28:09 - top padding top on the on the top oh
28:11 - okay
28:12 - no that's right that's right we can do
28:13 - that too that's right because because
28:15 - it's
28:15 - it looks like it's not balanced out i
28:18 - can do a padding top so maybe just you
28:19 - can put it in right there
28:21 - she's like pinning top three right there
28:23 - okay
28:24 - all right this looks better that's it
28:26 - save that a little better
28:28 - oh liver though is not possible without
28:29 - body or a head tag what just happened
28:32 - oh
28:33 - [Music]
28:37 - too much too much jesse
28:40 - we killed it oh
28:49 - yeah okay let's go let's go so let's
28:52 - make the input
28:55 - so let's go ahead and make uh input now
28:57 - at this point the input is going to be
28:58 - which one it is going to be
29:00 - uh this simple right here all right go
29:02 - ahead jesse feel free to make the input
29:04 - right now
29:06 - so input it's just like an html input
29:09 - okay so you're just going to say like
29:11 - this
29:12 - and the input
29:15 - you know first of all we're going to
29:17 - give it an id
29:18 - like normal we're going to give it
29:20 - search id okay
29:22 - we know we only want to type text into
29:24 - inside of the
29:25 - input and we're gonna give it a
29:27 - placeholder
29:28 - called search dot dot dot
29:31 - okay that's first the first part
29:35 - now oops now we're gonna style this
29:38 - input up
29:40 - okay that said my light went out
29:44 - okay still see me i still see it just
29:46 - don't worry
29:47 - i got you okay that's pro problem
29:51 - so the input guys what are we seeing
29:54 - with the input first of all
29:57 - um we got to give it of course a height
30:00 - that's right so let's give the height
30:01 - and a width okay so let's give it a
30:03 - height we're going to say here of course
30:05 - we're going to say class
30:07 - and i'm going to give it a height of 9
30:09 - okay and a width of
30:11 - 30. that's right okay 30. again that's
30:14 - good
30:14 - coming from here if i just if i type in
30:16 - just width here
30:18 - with what right and she types in the
30:22 - width of 30 for example right
30:23 - there's all these widths we can do and
30:25 - then look at this look at this
30:27 - width of 30 is basically right here or
30:30 - width 32 let's just say right with width
30:32 - of 8 rem
30:34 - that's it i am you see
30:37 - so that's it oh
30:40 - look we have it it's there
30:45 - so okay okay okay interesting let's
30:47 - finish it up first
30:49 - because but this is the thing though nas
30:51 - it is now
30:52 - vertically aligned it's not horizontally
30:55 - aligned
30:56 - that's right you know and the input is
30:59 - actually
31:00 - inside of the guess what guys the header
31:03 - header class that's right so what do we
31:05 - need to do
31:06 - with header which is the parent
31:08 - component what do we need to do there
31:11 - in order to get the items inside of the
31:13 - header
31:14 - horizontally aligned chat anybody know
31:17 - exactly monique very good flex we're
31:20 - going to use
31:21 - flex so normally in css you would say
31:23 - display flex but
31:24 - here guess what flex until when you only
31:28 - have to say flex see
31:29 - so display flex is equal to flex class
31:32 - right there
31:34 - and if you look now
31:37 - nice it looks good jesse nice job
31:40 - awesome
31:41 - this is the thing though that now it is
31:43 - next to each other but as you can see
31:45 - it's not really vertically aligned right
31:47 - so let's
31:48 - let's fix that and let's say items
31:51 - center
31:52 - now what css property does this look
31:55 - like guys
31:56 - css property with a value this is called
31:59 - which one
32:00 - a line a line items
32:04 - exactly a line item center and look
32:07 - the search is more in the middle of the
32:10 - header and that's what we want
32:11 - okay now let's go back to the um
32:15 - inputs so we gave it a background color
32:19 - okay and i want to give it a border so
32:22 - i'm going to give it border
32:25 - so the thing is in uh till when css
32:28 - just if you mention the word border it
32:31 - will by default
32:32 - give you a border a white one
32:36 - with one pixel solid uh line
32:39 - okay automatically you don't have to do
32:41 - anything you just have to fill in the
32:43 - word
32:44 - border however if you want to change
32:46 - that you're just going to do this
32:47 - you want to change the color of the
32:48 - border you say border
32:51 - gray 500.
32:55 - that's just a border color that's it so
32:57 - right there see
32:58 - that's the border color that's the
33:00 - border color
33:02 - now also i added an opacity to make it
33:05 - look a little bit less hard than it does
33:08 - okay so border opacity
33:11 - of 75 which means of 75
33:15 - okay and um
33:19 - i'm gonna make i want to make this
33:22 - rounded
33:24 - but do you think we should make it
33:26 - rounded here
33:27 - or at um
33:31 - oh no wait no yeah i do have rounded
33:33 - here yeah rounded
33:35 - i'm gonna say rounded
33:39 - on the left side because it's only on
33:42 - the
33:42 - left side rounded in this case watch it
33:45 - guys
33:45 - if you look at the design and you can
33:48 - say
33:49 - xl that's going to decide how big your
33:52 - curve is going to be
33:53 - how rounded it is going to be that's
33:55 - right so this is
33:57 - rounded lxl so if i go to tail and css
34:00 - exam
34:00 - again right if i say for example rounded
34:05 - uh dash l yeah right round
34:09 - l let me see let me show you guys round
34:12 - the dash
34:12 - l you see rounded dash l is small so
34:15 - border top left and border bottom left
34:18 - right so
34:18 - uh it's all going to be the left section
34:20 - so she's doing ronda l
34:22 - excel which is this one and that's doing
34:23 - a 0.75 remember the left radius
34:27 - on the top and the bottom guys okay
34:31 - nice and so now that looks kind of like
34:33 - this let's see
34:34 - oh let's go jesse that looks amazing
34:38 - ever get replaced for jesse let's go
34:41 - all right let's continue on well we're
34:44 - not we're far from done yet but yeah
34:46 - it's a start
34:47 - it's a need to start okay so
34:50 - as we can see we're gonna be we're gonna
34:53 - use some padding because look
34:55 - it's all a little bit together right so
34:59 - on the input we want um
35:03 - on the horizontal axis we want it to
35:06 - move to
35:07 - the right well what you can do
35:11 - you can give it a padding on the left
35:14 - and the right
35:15 - at the same time just by doing this
35:18 - p x hyphen three
35:22 - and so v x stands for uh padding on the
35:25 - x
35:26 - axis right there's p y yeah that's p x
35:29 - the x axis is left and right remember
35:31 - that
35:32 - okay and so if we did that yes okay
35:35 - we're going to give a
35:36 - axe a biscuit patty on the left hand
35:37 - side and also a penny from the right
35:40 - hand side guys okay
35:41 - and so you can see right there as you
35:43 - can see as i type you see it's not
35:45 - letting me type towards a certain amount
35:47 - but even though right now typing is like
35:48 - black so
35:49 - can we make the text color white jesse
35:53 - uh yeah we can make a text color white
35:55 - we would say
35:56 - text excuse me that's right that's right
35:59 - that's good so let's go save that
36:01 - if i click this boom right there look at
36:03 - that
36:06 - look at that one right there
36:09 - that's it cool cool now guys
36:12 - padding is always on the inside
36:16 - of the element that you're working in
36:18 - guess what margin is
36:20 - on the yacht on the outside that's right
36:23 - so
36:23 - we don't want the amazon and the input
36:26 - to touch
36:28 - um so it might in my screen they're
36:31 - touching a little bit oh they're not
36:32 - in your case they're not you should make
36:34 - it bigger okay that makes sense
36:36 - um but in order to always make sure
36:39 - there's some distance between them i'm
36:40 - going to give it a margin
36:41 - on the left side i'm going to give it a
36:43 - margin okay
36:47 - then i think don't you think the text is
36:49 - too big
36:50 - nice it's not too big this is actually
36:52 - pretty good text i like this deck this
36:53 - is a good text actually i kind of like
36:55 - it okay
36:57 - so could you oh ouch
37:00 - look at that that always hurts my eyes
37:03 - when you
37:04 - click on an input i hate it i don't even
37:06 - know the functionality of it
37:08 - you know so guys that is called um
37:11 - an outline and this outline will always
37:14 - be caused
37:15 - by focusing on the input focusing just
37:19 - clicking on it basically but you can
37:21 - remove this
37:22 - okay so you're going to say here until
37:25 - when css
37:27 - you're going to say focus colon
37:30 - outline hyphen none
37:33 - boom nice now can you click on it again
37:36 - nice are you ready for this guys are you
37:39 - ready for this
37:40 - oh it's not there thank you thank you
37:43 - thank you
37:44 - [Applause]
37:46 - it's not there
37:52 - awesome awesome then the next thing we
37:54 - need to do is after that we need to go
37:56 - ahead and actually create what
37:58 - we need to create this drop down this
38:00 - category shroud all right so how do we
38:01 - create that jesse next one next up
38:04 - oh that's not that hard actually once
38:07 - you know how to work the other things
38:09 - it's pretty easy however the nice thing
38:12 - of the fun thing with this category
38:14 - thing is that that little chef run
38:17 - the little triangle is called a chevron
38:20 - guys
38:21 - that um is an icon
38:24 - you can get from guess what
38:27 - tailwind library itself no way damn yay
38:31 - yeah it's called heroicons heroicons
38:35 - so nas if you go to the tailwind
38:37 - documentation
38:41 - right there okay so you say beautiful
38:43 - handcuffs and ssg icons by the makers of
38:45 - tail and css
38:46 - boom nice i'm liking this okay and so if
38:49 - i search up any nike for example
38:51 - uh what is that what is the icon called
38:53 - jesse
38:56 - um shepherd chef from so c-h-e-v
39:00 - i think that's the way you can find it
39:02 - or arrow oh i'm just saying arrow that's
39:04 - easier for me to understand
39:07 - arrow down let me see let me see there's
39:10 - a
39:10 - arrow down arrow down there we're down
39:12 - right there you see right there oh
39:13 - yeah yeah i know oh you're gonna click
39:17 - copy spg
39:18 - all you have to do is click copy svg and
39:20 - then you can even paste it uh later on
39:22 - but we'll paste it here in a second guys
39:24 - okay
39:24 - yeah so well for first here's a second
39:26 - guys first we need to create the
39:28 - categories so let's do that right now
39:29 - jesse exactly
39:31 - so we're going to say diff class and
39:33 - we'll call this category so
39:35 - the thing is though guys there's a lot
39:36 - of um inline styling indeed with two in
39:39 - css
39:41 - so it's hard to read through it but if
39:42 - you give your classes certain names
39:45 - it's so much easier to look through
39:46 - exactly the later point okay that's
39:48 - right so
39:49 - have the div here okay and
39:52 - of course we're going to give this also
39:54 - a height okay
39:56 - of nine we're going to give it a width
39:58 - of 10.
40:00 - it's not very big and oh
40:03 - we're gonna give it that specific
40:06 - wait are we already there yeah no i was
40:09 - i was going too fast

40:13 - going at the yellow the yellow part with
40:14 - the
40:15 - magnifying glass oh so we're going to
40:17 - give the width of 30.
40:19 - we're going to give it a grayish color
40:22 - the
40:23 - the categories one right yeah

40:57 - did at the
40:58 - at the first part okay 75
41:01 - and guess what
41:05 - we're also going to give it to be

42:36 - all right so let's go ahead and save
42:37 - that right there
42:39 - yeah where is it where is it where is it
42:43 - oh because you put it inside the spg you

42:54 - nice so the first things first we need
42:56 - to do with this of course guys is going
42:57 - to be
42:58 - let's change the color of the category
43:00 - so let's do that right now okay
43:01 - to make the color white what do we say
43:04 - what do we say
43:04 - for the class what are we just saying
43:06 - white text
43:07 - dash white that's it so if i do text as
43:10 - white boom
43:11 - also you can see that awesome you see
43:13 - the svg and the categories
43:15 - right they're kind of top to bottom and
43:17 - what do we do to make it left to right
43:19 - anybody know raise your hand or uh
43:22 - somebody said yes can we use select tag
43:24 - when not using select text just yet for
43:26 - this one okay ahead
43:27 - so we can simply use flex that's right
43:30 - so if i do flex
43:31 - let's go awesome jason very good boom
43:33 - boom
43:34 - also let's let's go ahead and make sure
43:36 - that we align it vertically so to line
43:39 - it vertically we do item center as the
43:41 - class as well
43:42 - okay so if i save that oh that's not
43:44 - what i want to save
43:46 - no if i save that boom categories are
43:49 - saved so we are so so close
43:54 - right as you can see guys the the inputs
43:57 - that text is not white because actually
44:00 - once nas was typing that text was white
44:03 - but the search
44:04 - now is not white and why is that because
44:07 - guess what
44:08 - that's not really text that is called
44:10 - the placeholder
44:11 - so in order to change that you can say
44:13 - placeholder
44:15 - hyphen white and now see what happens
44:18 - that's a good one placeholders white if
44:20 - i save that right now
44:22 - right so you can see right there the
44:24 - placeholder just changed to white
44:26 - color because jesse just added
44:28 - placeholder white right here okay
44:30 - so we got that our next step is going to
44:32 - be to
44:33 - add our what our search icon right jesse
44:37 - yes the search icon so again you have to
44:40 - search up that icon
44:42 - inside of the tailwind um
44:46 - library that's right so i'm going to say
44:48 - search here i'll go to hero icon
44:50 - say search right there and i'm going to
44:53 - use
44:54 - this one right i'm going to use this one
44:55 - so um copy svg
44:58 - and then where do i need to put this
44:59 - we're going to create another div right
45:01 - here
45:03 - go to create another name we're going to
45:05 - create another div
45:06 - and then we're going to call it a search
45:08 - icon okay
45:11 - and this search icon guess what
45:14 - it is that pretty typical amazon color
45:18 - so we're going to say uh bg yellow
45:22 - 500 okay and i'm going to close this one
45:26 - off
45:27 - and then let's paste that let's paste
45:30 - that
45:30 - um svg in do you have it i have it right
45:33 - here
45:34 - no paste interruption awesome save that
45:37 - oh
45:38 - right there so there it is so of course
45:39 - there's a lot we need to modify
45:41 - there it is allow me to monitor for this
45:42 - one now okay the first thing you need to
45:44 - do
45:45 - is yeah one we need to give it the same
45:47 - height so it's going to give the same
45:48 - height jesse
45:49 - yeah nine eight nine good and let's get
45:52 - a width of ten
45:53 - width of ten good and let's go ahead and
45:55 - give it the round corners
45:57 - it deserves okay and
46:01 - so somebody's asking for the svg okay
46:03 - guys
46:04 - boom boom boom here in the zoom chat
46:07 - okay so the icon
46:10 - is rounded it's in a rounded diff right
46:12 - so round it
46:14 - but guess what guys on what side is it
46:17 - rounded
46:18 - on the right hand side did i get a right
46:20 - jessie
46:22 - yeah yeah so rounded hyphen
46:25 - r for right and then again xl because
46:28 - that's the
46:29 - the amount of the curve that we want to
46:31 - have okay xl
46:33 - xl that's right so i'm going to okay can
46:34 - you save that i will save that right now
46:37 - so you can see right there beautiful
46:39 - rounded sure now what do you see that we
46:41 - need to change now at this point
46:42 - we've got the icon which is oh
46:46 - but we need to center it now so let's go
46:47 - and center it jesse
46:50 - yeah so of course display flex so we're
46:52 - going to use flex here
46:54 - and guess what to get it in the middle
46:56 - of that orange box
46:58 - we're going to say um
47:02 - which justify center
47:05 - okay nice and i think that's enough
47:08 - and then we need to i do item center as
47:10 - well vertically line so when you items
47:13 - yeah center center
47:17 - to land vertically so basically justify
47:19 - center is going to justify content
47:21 - so justify conte is going to align
47:22 - things horizontally
47:24 - align items which is in this case item
47:26 - center is going to align
47:27 - vertically guys okay sure for sure
47:31 - now what else do you guys see that svg
47:34 - that magnifying glass it's not white
47:38 - it's not white so what can we do we can
47:42 - change that okay so
47:44 - guess what guys inside of this svg so
47:46 - pay attention okay by the way
47:49 - your indentation css
47:52 - needs to be clean as
47:55 - that's how serious i am about it because
47:57 - i'm using the f word okay
47:59 - so um it has to be super clean because
48:02 - look otherwise you don't know
48:04 - what's happening inside of your divs and
48:06 - who which one is the parent
48:08 - component and which is the child
48:10 - component that component element is a
48:12 - better word
48:12 - but you guys know what i mean so here
48:15 - inside of the svg on line 25
48:17 - i'm going to add a class actually just
48:20 - just
48:21 - just guess what jesse jesse check this
48:23 - out jesse
48:26 - actually if we just simply do text white
48:30 - on the parent it makes the whole thing
48:32 - text way
48:36 - are you sure oh yeah look at my zoom
48:40 - oh yeah oh shoot
48:44 - yeah yeah yeah yeah cool cool cool yeah
48:47 - so i just wanted to point out that
48:50 - you know so this is the thing guys
48:54 - the svg it can be changed because it's
48:56 - actually seen
48:58 - as text even though it's
49:01 - an image an icon isn't that cool
49:04 - yeah so apparently it works also works
49:06 - on the parent component
49:07 - component but you can also change things
49:10 - inside of the svg okay by adding a class
49:14 - but in this case it wasn't needed
49:15 - so okay so at this point what have we
49:18 - got we've got
49:19 - uh the section with you know the
49:20 - navigation then search bar the logo
49:23 - the next thing we need to now focus on
49:25 - is going to be the right those right
49:26 - icons that we have on the right hand
49:27 - side
49:28 - so let's go ahead and take a look at how
49:29 - do we build those can i build those with
49:30 - you jesse is that okay
49:32 - yeah for sure you can build those okay i
49:35 - would put them in a
49:36 - in a diff class okay so let's do this
49:38 - we've got this stuff down
49:40 - and i'm going i'm going to give it like
49:41 - a really small uh what i like to do
49:43 - sometimes is for example
49:45 - i like to give it like a comment so i
49:46 - would like to do uh 2
49:48 - 2 2 2 2 and that gives me a comment
49:51 - section
49:51 - and then now i'm going to say you know
49:53 - this is going to be what should we call
49:55 - it the right icons
49:57 - right and this way i can divide things
49:59 - up okay guys
50:00 - i'm going to create another a new div
50:02 - and inside this i'm going to say
50:04 - uh class is equal to icons okay
50:07 - now again this has nothing to do this
50:09 - class does nothing exactly because
50:11 - this cuz is just for you to know exactly
50:12 - what this div is about that's it
50:14 - okay nothing crazy so in this dev class
50:17 - icons we'll have a few
50:19 - different icons that we need to
50:20 - incorporate the first icon is going to
50:22 - be which one it's going to be the heart
50:24 - icon
50:24 - right jesse so if all we have to do is
50:27 - just go ahead and click
50:28 - heart heart oh the heart is so
50:33 - so there so fragile we've got the heart
50:36 - icon no
50:37 - don't get emo now we're coding
50:41 - it's so fragile so we got the hard icon
50:44 - the next icon we need to
50:45 - work on is going to be which one it is
50:47 - actually going to be this
50:49 - card icon but this is actually inside a
50:51 - div so
50:52 - if i simply just go ahead and create a
50:53 - new dip why do i say it's an inside idea
50:55 - because
50:56 - you can see that you know around this
50:58 - card is actually
50:59 - a orange color right an orange color so
51:02 - if i go ahead and simply just create a
51:04 - div and let's say call it the card icon
51:06 - so div
51:08 - a class and that's going to be cart icon
51:11 - again has nothing at all to do with
51:13 - anything
51:15 - card icon and then what we'll do is
51:18 - we'll give this div
51:19 - a an actual svg inside of that which
51:22 - will be the cart
51:23 - so let's go back to the hero icons let's
51:25 - select cart inside here
51:28 - shopping cart copy svg maybe just you
51:32 - can copy for them inside the chat
51:34 - boom right there that's our svg for the
51:36 - card icon
51:37 - okay all right now of course for the
51:40 - card icon if you need
51:41 - if things need to happen which is going
51:43 - to be we need to give it a
51:45 - height and a width so let's do that
51:46 - right now okay
51:48 - um let's go ahead i'm going to save this
51:50 - here so we can see it
51:52 - okay so it's kind of there and kind of
51:54 - not
51:55 - why because the icon section needs a
51:58 - text of white
51:59 - text of white to make sure that we have
52:02 - all the icons are there also what do you
52:05 - see here guys
52:06 - all the icons are what top to
52:09 - what top to bottom right but
52:13 - but how do we make them left to right
52:16 - left to right what do we do here guys
52:17 - what do we do
52:19 - we do flex that's right thank you so
52:22 - we're going to say text right and i'm
52:23 - saying
52:23 - flex oh not there not there
52:27 - i'll say space flex boom
52:30 - save that nice good i like it so now you
52:33 - can see it's left to right
52:34 - that's exactly how i like it for the
52:36 - card icon i'm going to give a
52:38 - certain a certain width and a certain
52:40 - height okay
52:41 - i'm going to say this is going to be an
52:43 - h of 10.
52:46 - each dash hello hi jessie and a width of
52:49 - ten
52:50 - okay so that's it that's i'm going to
52:52 - save that
52:54 - and uh
52:59 - nothing really crazy happened there
53:01 - don't worry about it okay
53:02 - then let's say bg dash yellow
53:05 - dash 500 and now we see oh there we go
53:09 - that's exactly what i'm talking about
53:10 - so now we have this background which is
53:12 - exactly what we need
53:14 - for the card icon all right okay
53:17 - now let's go ahead and what we need to
53:19 - align that card icon in
53:21 - the card inside the center what do we do
53:23 - guys
53:24 - who knows you guys should know but at
53:26 - this point who knows
53:28 - brendan who knows brendan knows yeah
53:30 - brendan knows i know brendan knows
53:33 - so we're going to say what i'm going to
53:35 - say flex
53:37 - item center for to refer align it
53:40 - vertically
53:42 - and then what is it justify
53:45 - center correct jesse i'm going to
53:46 - remember justify
53:49 - that's right justify
53:52 - dash center save that
53:55 - boom right there right next let's go
53:58 - ahead and give it a rounded
54:00 - section so i'm going to say rounded dash
54:03 - xl because rounded
54:06 - excel oops
54:10 - rounded dash excel
54:14 - and that is it boom also let's go ahead
54:16 - and change the font size potentially
54:18 - because i feel like it's a bit too big
54:19 - so to change the font size um how to
54:22 - choose the font size of this one jesse
54:24 - i don't really know for this one but
54:26 - approach to the font side to make it a
54:27 - little bit small because i feel like
54:28 - it's a bit too big
54:29 - so i'm going to the svg
54:32 - say font size
54:35 - font size i'm going to go back to 101
54:38 - css let me say font size
54:40 - and so i can say some stuff like text
54:42 - small for example let's just say i do
54:44 - uh for this one i do text
54:47 - dash small okay let's see
54:52 - okay did this did it make it smaller or
54:56 - no
54:56 - i don't really think so did it
55:01 - no i don't think so either let's see
55:05 - okay texture small
55:08 - maybe i can put it on the actual icon
55:09 - itself some say class
55:13 - text is small no just make this bigger
55:16 - what
55:17 - how's that possible the text is small
55:20 - actually i made it bigger what the hell
55:22 - that's interesting okay let's just try
55:24 - one more time
55:26 - okay let me make it even smaller
55:27 - potentially let me see
55:30 - text is extra small
55:34 - extras how small do you want to make
55:38 - i know it's just it's big it's like how
55:40 - do i make it smaller
55:41 - that's the question i'm trying to figure
55:43 - out right or maybe i just give it a spin
55:46 - okay maybe instead of doing that here's
55:48 - another solution
55:50 - so do that i give it a height and a
55:51 - width so instead of doing that i go to
55:54 - the svg let's say
55:55 - uh class right because you can do that
55:59 - inside the svg
56:01 - i can say hi yeah that's four and a
56:03 - width dash four
56:06 - there we go thank you very much thank
56:08 - you very much now it's not small
56:10 - yeah okay and then let's go do the same
56:13 - thing for the other icon which is the
56:14 - heart icon
56:19 - which is which one which is here
56:22 - okay now let's do entergy class
56:25 - is equal to then height and width boom
56:28 - right there
56:29 - okay so much much yeah yeah yeah yeah
56:31 - okay let's also make sure that we
56:33 - align all this kind of stuff vertically
56:35 - you see how the heart is on the top
56:37 - while the card is cut in the center i
56:38 - don't like that so i will say
56:40 - flex items uh items dash
56:44 - center boom nice now the heart is in the
56:48 - middle
56:49 - all right exactly i want next up let's
56:51 - go and add another icon
56:52 - and this time it's going to be which one
56:56 - the bell icon bell so let's go ahead and
56:58 - do this i'm gonna say
57:00 - bell here's the bell copy svg here
57:03 - and then i'm going to paste the bell
57:06 - icon
57:07 - after our uh div class card icon right
57:10 - here
57:11 - so paste it in boom we've got the bell
57:13 - icon now
57:15 - hey there it is it's still big which i
57:16 - don't like but that's okay all right
57:18 - okay we got the bell icon and then
57:20 - finally there's this which i have no
57:22 - idea how to build
57:23 - but jesse does now i'm can i do it too
57:25 - but
57:26 - jesse knows even better no
57:30 - that's definitely not the case me
57:31 - knowing something
57:33 - you don't no no no no so
57:36 - what is your question so let's go ahead
57:38 - and continue on i will let you go ahead
57:40 - and take the reins now at this point
57:41 - okay we've got these heart icons we've
57:42 - got the card icons
57:44 - we've got the bell icon okay let's take
57:46 - a look at what we need to do
57:48 - the one thing i will add though myself
57:50 - though right now
57:51 - is i will go ahead and add some padding
57:52 - i think from the left hand side
57:54 - to make sure that you know it's kind of
57:55 - separated more should we do that
57:59 - yeah that's always a good good idea
58:01 - right to do that makes it always
58:03 - clean that's right so much cleaner so to
58:06 - add the padding
58:08 - all we need to do is we do either
58:11 - padding or
58:12 - margin or how do we make sure that it's
58:15 - always on the right hand side jesse
58:18 - right how do we make sure that this
58:21 - specific
58:22 - um what's it called um these icons
58:25 - icons yeah how to make sure it's all
58:28 - inside
58:30 - oh i would i like to use
58:34 - a margin auto for that in regular css
58:39 - um so for this we could do
58:43 - margin left auto which means it's going
58:46 - to the right
58:48 - so what would happen if i do margin left
58:51 - auto let's see if i go to the icons and
58:52 - i say
58:53 - here and i say ml dash auto
58:57 - boom you see ml the shot automatically
58:59 - just pushes to the right hand side
59:01 - and so basically it just adds a margin
59:03 - to the left-hand side automatically okay
59:06 - that's all honestly that is it okay and
59:08 - then what we're going to do we're going
59:10 - to add a margin right as well so i'm
59:11 - going to say
59:12 - margin right e to just give us some
59:15 - space here from the right-hand side
59:16 - there we go
59:17 - i like it yeah nice and then honestly
59:20 - and then let's go ahead and do and give
59:22 - it a width so i'm going to say i'm going
59:23 - to say here's the width
59:25 - width is going to be 48
59:28 - and then the height is gonna be the 16
59:32 - that we usually know
59:33 - guys boom okay so and push to the
59:36 - left-hand side now because why because
59:38 - if you look at the div let's go ahead
59:39 - and right-click on this one
59:43 - if you look at the div here boom here's
59:46 - a dip you see
59:47 - the div is big it's a big div
59:50 - right there it's on the right hand side
59:52 - there's marginal on the left hand side
59:54 - but it it aligned all its items svg
59:57 - items to the left hand side
59:59 - so what do we do to make sure it's kind
60:00 - of more spaced around what do you think
60:02 - jesse
60:04 - ooh i would use something um
60:07 - like justify around yeah so because you
60:10 - gave that
60:11 - icons menu you gave it a certain width
60:13 - right
60:14 - so those icons can only move freely
60:16 - within the width
60:18 - of that container correct so if you give
60:21 - it like
60:22 - justify um space around or just
60:25 - justify space evenly then it will
60:28 - um give space evenly or a little bit
60:31 - around it
60:32 - depending on what you choose of course
60:34 - inside of that container
60:36 - that's right applied it to those items
60:38 - that's right okay
60:39 - so i would choose justify around did you
60:42 - choose that one that's the issue yeah
60:44 - great
60:44 - and so this is all we have right now
60:46 - right but of course it's not done yet
60:47 - because the one big thing we need to add
60:48 - now is going to be this little
60:50 - svg icon so jesse go ahead and take the
60:53 - reins and see how you make that happen
60:56 - so that was like this fun um
60:59 - jay dentacon which is like an avatar
61:02 - based on your name
61:04 - so let me check up if you go if you look
61:07 - up in google

69:28 - go back to my amazon
69:29 - project let me go ahead and put it on
69:30 - the left hand side oh that's not what i
69:32 - want
69:32 - okay good good good good good good good
69:34 - good all right
69:36 - and what i'm going to do is the
69:37 - following so we've got this section and
69:38 - i'm actually going to minimize it
69:40 - what i like to do is i'll do like this i
69:42 - go i like to see okay see this is the
69:43 - div class header
69:44 - minimize it done so now we're done with
69:46 - the header and i just minimized it and
69:48 - just you just simply click on this
69:49 - little
69:50 - oh now i know it's called the chevron
69:52 - icon
69:54 - you click on the icon fancy right i also
69:57 - didn't know that i didn't know either
69:58 - so that's funny okay and then let's go
70:01 - and do div class
70:02 - main and assign this mean this is where
70:04 - we need to create our sidebar
70:06 - uh section so let's do that
70:10 - right now okay
70:15 - can you give me a live share i sent you
70:17 - a link jesse
70:19 - oh really yeah it's in it's in uh it's
70:21 - the same link as before
70:24 - oh okay just try using that link okay
70:27 - yeah okay so let's go ahead and do this
70:30 - let's create a div
70:31 - class is equal to what should we call it
70:35 - guys and we have an idea what should we
70:36 - call this
70:38 - what should we call this
70:41 - a jess is trying to join she's trying to
70:43 - take over here
70:44 - careful guys careful careful jesse will
70:47 - take over
70:48 - all right class and then we'll say
70:51 - ready or not here i come main dash
70:54 - sidebar
70:55 - okay that's going to be the left sidebar
70:57 - that we have on the left hand side which
70:58 - is this one
71:00 - okay and then what should we call this
71:03 - section right here what should we call
71:04 - this section anybody know
71:06 - what should we call this section i have
71:08 - an idea
71:10 - for this section we should call it on
71:11 - the main section sorry it's just that's
71:13 - not too creative but it does it is what
71:15 - it is
71:17 - class is equal to main dash section
71:22 - all right so we get two sections now
71:24 - which is great left to right
71:26 - let's focus on now the sidebar section
71:29 - for the sidebar section a few things
71:31 - we're going to make it
71:32 - make that happen okay let me see so the
71:34 - side by section
71:36 - let's number one let's make sure let's
71:37 - give it a width so for the sidebar i'm
71:39 - gonna say
71:40 - width width is
71:43 - uh dash one dash five so with dash
71:47 - one dash five is basically
71:50 - if i go to my tail and c set
71:51 - documentation but go to width
71:54 - here right
71:57 - one one over five is going to be with
72:00 - twenty percent that's what that means
72:01 - okay
72:02 - so let's go ahead and go to that okay
72:04 - let's also give it a background color so
72:06 - i'm gonna say
72:07 - for this i'm going to say uh bg
72:12 - oh jesse is trying to join again dan yes
72:14 - he's just trying to you know she's just
72:15 - like
72:20 - bg gray 900s let's say bg
72:24 - dash gray
72:27 - dash 900 so i'm going to save that and
72:30 - we don't see nothing yet because why
72:32 - because yes we have a width but the
72:35 - issue is
72:36 - we um we don't have a height that's the
72:39 - issue guys okay
72:40 - so they have a height so let's do that
72:42 - right now and i'm going to say the
72:44 - height is actually going to be
72:46 - very interesting because the height
72:49 - is going to be the full height of the
72:51 - screen so
72:53 - check this one out i'm going to go to
72:55 - this um
72:57 - the the the main section and i want to
73:00 - say you know what
73:01 - the height of this whole main section is
73:04 - going to be
73:05 - h dash screen that's right it's very
73:08 - interesting it's maybe you
73:09 - haven't seen this people with this one
73:10 - before but it's like this
73:13 - where is it here each dash screen
73:17 - and how do we get that because
73:21 - if i go here
73:25 - height that screen is height
73:28 - 100 v8 so 100 vh is 100 vertical
73:32 - height so whatever the vertical height
73:33 - is off the browser
73:35 - that's the height it's going to take up
73:37 - okay all right
73:38 - next thing what we're going to do is
73:40 - we're going to say okay
73:42 - flex because right now flex is kind of
73:44 - flex is going to make it
73:46 - from left to right so save this boom
73:48 - right there you see what had just
73:49 - happened
73:50 - because i made it flex okay it said hey
73:53 - you know what
73:54 - this div needs to take up as much height
73:56 - as possible which in our case it is
73:58 - because
73:59 - the parent div is taking up the full
74:01 - height of you know the actual screen
74:03 - right and then the other divs are going
74:06 - to take as much as possible as well
74:07 - because they are flex items
74:09 - okay so we've got that let's go ahead
74:11 - and do a border i'm going to say border
74:13 - grade 700 in here so i'm going to say
74:18 - [Music]
74:19 - border gray 700 okay
74:22 - to give it a border but there's no
74:23 - border right now instead i'm going to do
74:25 - border top dash 2 okay
74:30 - so border top dash 2 oh
74:34 - jess is trying to read it right again
74:36 - dang jesse
74:40 - right and there we go we just added a
74:41 - board to the top section right here you
74:43 - guys can see that
74:44 - boom right there okay so we've got that
74:47 - we got our border gray
74:49 - let's go ahead honestly and that's
74:51 - that's it for now okay
74:52 - next thing let's go ahead and i know
74:56 - it's pretty cool right it looks so good
74:57 - though
74:58 - i know it looks so good looks so good
74:59 - yeah i like it too
75:03 - inside here what we also need to think
75:04 - about is the fact that these are
75:06 - categories
75:07 - but you see because there's padding on
75:09 - the left-hand side on the right-hand
75:10 - side from the top from the bottom
75:13 - we need to create a div around
75:16 - this right here right
75:19 - to make sure that we make that padding
75:21 - actually work
75:22 - so i'm going to say here dev
75:26 - class oh where are you playing oh jesse
75:28 - jesse okay
75:29 - wait are you not going to do it inside
75:31 - of here you're right you're right no you
75:33 - continue typing that's right you just do
75:34 - it just do it
75:35 - [Music]
75:37 - thank you sidebar
75:40 - categories that's right okay guys so
75:42 - what are we
75:43 - gonna be putting inside of the sidebar
75:45 - categories makes sense right
75:47 - categories well first of all
75:52 - oh we got that fancy first category
75:56 - categories label i would say
75:59 - so let's make another div class for that
76:01 - okay
76:02 - let's say wait wait wait okay yeah diff
76:05 - class
76:06 - boom oh div class
76:10 - and my indentation on point okay
76:14 - and we're going to give that text we're
76:16 - going to give it a color
76:17 - 500. okay we haven't made the text yet
76:20 - guys so wait a minute okay
76:22 - and when we are upon that text we're
76:24 - going to give it a cursor
76:26 - pointer okay should i start with this
76:28 - though
76:30 - and what you can call it is you can
76:31 - think
76:33 - that's right that's cool so you know you
76:34 - don't need this what you can you can
76:35 - call this actually div
76:37 - because this div is a category you can
76:39 - call it a main cast so
76:40 - we can say hey you know what this is
76:42 - called a sidebar
76:43 - sidebar dash main
76:48 - dash category right here you see
76:51 - right there okay so this tells exactly
76:53 - what it is right
76:54 - and we don't need anything crazy inside
76:56 - here right oh that jesse just said
77:00 - no we don't yeah yeah yeah we don't hey
77:03 - hey
77:04 - the end yeah okay okay but we do
77:09 - we do need that um
77:12 - icon with the four squares and we need
77:16 - the word categories of course that's
77:18 - right so
77:19 - to get the idea of the four squares i'm
77:21 - going to go to hero icons
77:23 - and i'm going to say yeah i don't know
77:26 - what did i say what was the name of that
77:27 - view grid grid so view
77:31 - hyphen right here so i'm gonna say type
77:34 - in grid
77:34 - into my search i'm gonna copy svg from
77:36 - the view grid
77:38 - okay right there and jesse already
77:40 - copied and pasted it inside here
77:42 - thank you jesse and then after that
77:46 - i'm gonna say categories i'm gonna give
77:48 - the text category so let's go and do
77:49 - that right now
77:54 - but you should we put this in the span
77:57 - class
77:58 - uh we will we will we will but that's
78:00 - going to come in a second here we will
78:02 - we will we will okay that's right so i'm
78:04 - going to say categories
78:06 - categories just like this i'm gonna say
78:08 - expand categories inside here
78:10 - and why am i doing spam because when i
78:11 - don't like to leave text just like out
78:13 - like that
78:14 - i like to give text a little span so i
78:16 - can maybe control the stand later on so
78:18 - i'm going to span
78:19 - and i'm going to say categories right
78:20 - here
78:23 - cut gories okay
78:27 - save that nice nice nice nice nice and
78:30 - then
78:30 - we can put a spin around that too
78:32 - because uh
78:34 - we can actually we want to give like a
78:35 - width later on so we want to actually
78:37 - you know encapsulate it into a certain
78:39 - width height so let's put a spin around
78:42 - that one
78:45 - like this i'm going to add the closing
78:48 - tag of the span to the bottom as well
78:51 - boom right there okay
78:56 - okay beautiful okay that looks good
78:59 - i'm gonna hit enter right here so i can
79:01 - just put it on the next section
79:04 - nice right there okay so we've got the
79:06 - svg we've got the span that looks really
79:08 - really
79:08 - really good and then let's now add some
79:11 - styling to it
79:12 - so for number one we see the categories
79:14 - and that the little
79:15 - icon is just not looking too good it's
79:17 - top to bottom
79:18 - you guys know the drill where did this
79:20 - one how to make it from left to right
79:22 - very simple drill that's right
79:25 - flex flex it flex flex it barely not
79:28 - forget it
79:32 - i don't know if you guys know what that
79:33 - is but
79:36 - all right flex nice nice nice also
79:39 - also with the span let's give it away
79:41 - someone say with dash eight
79:43 - just a little bit smaller okay oh no
79:45 - class width
79:50 - it's going to be width dash eight just
79:52 - make it a little bit smaller
79:54 - nice right or just actually give it a
79:56 - width okay
79:57 - and then what i want to do is i want to
79:58 - give the whole thing as some padding
80:00 - guys okay
80:01 - now because you can see this is always
80:03 - on the edge icon which i don't like
80:05 - i don't like that at all so what i'm
80:07 - going to do is i'm going to give a
80:09 - padding of six remember how we create
80:11 - this side by category so we can control
80:13 - it well if i just do p six
80:18 - boom you see it pushed everything from
80:20 - the inside right so it pushed everything
80:21 - from
80:22 - from oh wow that's right so from the
80:24 - left
80:25 - from the top from from the left right
80:28 - here
80:28 - from the right right here and of course
80:30 - on the top as well it pushed everything
80:32 - like that okay
80:33 - that's it and so then what we want to do
80:35 - is let's go ahead and also make it a
80:37 - font
80:37 - bold because it's bold right now so i'm
80:40 - going to say
80:41 - on here on the sidebar main category i'm
80:44 - going to say
80:44 - font dash bold
80:48 - so guys this is on the sidebar um
80:54 - categories that's right it's on the
80:56 - subject categories right main category
80:58 - yeah that's right so you've got the font
80:59 - bold that's looking all good and right
81:02 - now
81:03 - nothing nothing too crazy that we need
81:05 - to focus on too much
81:07 - right because let's it's not necessary
81:09 - right now
81:10 - so instead i'm going to do is the
81:11 - following let's go ahead and do this
81:13 - okay
81:14 - let's move on to the next one which is
81:15 - going to be this echo
81:17 - and alexa which is not the main category
81:20 - but it's it's a subcategory
81:22 - so i'm going to create another div right
81:23 - now
81:25 - right there so let's put another div
81:27 - underneath this
81:28 - okay and then i'm going to say div class
81:33 - is equal to and here i'm going to call
81:35 - it a
81:36 - sidebar also i'm going to call this side
81:38 - by my cursor so i'm going to sidebar
81:39 - sidebar dash main
81:43 - dash category
81:49 - gory okay
81:52 - great and this is going to have a a spin
81:59 - span of what uh echo
82:03 - and alexa not m but and
82:08 - alexa good echo and alexa okay and then
82:12 - here's what i'm gonna do we're gonna
82:13 - also going to put the span of the svg
82:15 - image so i'm gonna say s
82:16 - span but there is no svg it's an
82:18 - interesting portion
82:20 - right it's an empty span with the width
82:22 - of
82:23 - 8 look why
82:26 - because that is what will align
82:28 - everything else together
82:29 - so if i look at it like this right and i
82:32 - simply just
82:33 - copy whatever we have here so for
82:35 - example we have all these classes for
82:36 - this
82:37 - sidebar main category i'm going to copy
82:39 - all these text yellows and stuff like
82:41 - that
82:41 - i'm going to put it in the class right
82:43 - here
82:45 - boom save that go to the amazon see
82:48 - very simple right a similar structure
82:51 - but of course
82:52 - i don't want that just like that so i
82:54 - want to remove the text yellow because
82:55 - we don't need that right now
82:59 - okay okay and instead of to do text
83:04 - white
83:07 - nice text and white okay now of course
83:09 - if i made this bigger
83:10 - you can see that it will expand later on
83:12 - to something so
83:13 - right there right there good good good
83:15 - good then also what i'm going to do is
83:16 - i'm going
83:17 - going to give it a small uh what's it
83:20 - called a small padding
83:21 - and also i want to give it a a some
83:24 - small part margin
83:26 - so for the margin of categories i'm
83:28 - going to go to the margin of categories
83:30 - i'm going to say margin bottom
83:32 - dash four but that pictures everything
83:36 - else
83:37 - and i'm gonna do p dash two
83:40 - to give it some padding as well just
83:42 - again it's creating a lot of space which
83:44 - which is what i like okay so we got text
83:46 - white
83:47 - we got the items uh what's it called
83:49 - it's it's
83:50 - in there as well um we have the p2
83:54 - we've got that we got that let's go
83:56 - ahead and now copy this
84:00 - okay and all we do is now replicate this
84:02 - i'm gonna say copy
84:03 - and now just keep replicating it so i'm
84:05 - gonna copy
84:06 - paste it pasta i like to call it and
84:09 - then instead of act on alexa
84:11 - i'm going to say what jesse i'm gonna
84:13 - say kindle
84:17 - let's say kindle boom done okay
84:21 - there's that one i'm going to copy this
84:23 - one again
84:25 - i know it's crazy just copy pasting huh
84:27 - then we have books
84:30 - that's what thank you jesse i want to
84:32 - copy again i'm going to say electronics
84:40 - there we go and i'm going to copy one
84:42 - more time
84:43 - and bro this time we're going to say uh
84:46 - home and garden
84:51 - nice then one last time i'm going to
84:53 - copy and paste gonna say
84:55 - uh fashion
84:59 - nice save that amazon
85:03 - oh that looks horrible
85:08 - i mean not that bad actually
85:11 - not actually not that bad not that bad
85:13 - so i think we just need to give
85:15 - every single one of our sidebar main
85:16 - categories a little bit of
85:18 - maybe padding or a little bit of margin
85:20 - so that they're spaced out a little bit
85:21 - more because i feel like they're not
85:22 - spaced out
85:23 - uh enough am i right jesse but wait now
85:27 - it looks good
85:28 - wait where you refreshed it
85:32 - um i don't like it i think we can we can
85:35 - space it out even more a little bit
85:36 - honestly
85:38 - oh you mean like the bottoms yeah yeah
85:40 - well we have to give it the march
85:41 - margin bottom each of those categories
85:44 - then right
85:44 - that's right so i'll do that right now
85:47 - okay
85:48 - um i would say a margin bottom
85:52 - of about four
85:55 - something i would say two i'll say
85:57 - margin bottom two jesse
85:59 - merchant button two that's right bottom
86:00 - two so let's go to the echo alexa
86:02 - and we'll do uh for this one we'll do
86:04 - mb-2
86:07 - save that that pushes more to the bottom
86:10 - then we go to the other one we'll do mb
86:12 - last year for this one
86:14 - okay push a bit more
86:18 - let me see here so i can show it to you
86:20 - guys there we go
86:22 - nice nice okay same thing with the books
86:27 - and b there's two thank you just oh dang
86:29 - jesus is right in running in multiple
86:30 - places
86:31 - she's fancy all right right there that
86:34 - just pushed a little bit more watch out
86:35 - which i like and i think this margin
86:36 - bottom
86:37 - three four is a little too big i'm gonna
86:38 - say margin bottom three instead
86:41 - yeah maybe maybe remove the margin fully
86:43 - let's see
86:46 - yeah i kind of like that and then also
86:49 - what i want to want to make sure that
86:50 - this
86:50 - does happen if you take a look at our
86:52 - categories
86:53 - you can see that our echo and our alexa
86:56 - kind of are on the same step page you
86:58 - see that from the left to right hand
86:59 - side
87:00 - this is kind of the same page the white
87:02 - the reason why that's not happening is
87:04 - there's a few reasons why that's not
87:05 - happening it's actually because of
87:07 - one we have a padding here but we don't
87:10 - have a padding here so if i do for
87:12 - example p2
87:16 - right okay
87:19 - see right there echo and alexa just
87:21 - align together you see
87:23 - uh a line's good with the categories
87:25 - same thing with the other ones
87:26 - also p dish two
87:31 - boom boom aligned together next one
87:35 - p dash two but padding two guys
87:40 - what is it what is this heading two guys
87:42 - means padding on all sides of the div
87:45 - so left right top bottom p dash two
87:49 - a p dash
87:52 - two p dash two um because we've added a
87:55 - padding
87:56 - we might not need the margin so actually
87:57 - remember remove this for a second i i
87:58 - know we do this for no reason
88:03 - why boom boom
88:06 - save that hey now it's clean that's the
88:09 - way i like it okay
88:11 - good one thing i want to add now at this
88:13 - point is
88:14 - this right here is called the active uh
88:17 - page right category this is called the
88:18 - active page
88:19 - and so whenever i hover over this i'm
88:21 - gonna have it like this but this is
88:22 - called the active page so we need to
88:24 - create that
88:25 - active section okay to create the access

96:21 - uh maybe just maybe give it a little
96:23 - more space and that's the only thing
96:24 - i would say that margin bottom maybe
96:27 - four so let's do this right here
96:28 - on the cell on amazon let's do mb-4
96:33 - just so we space it out just a little
96:34 - bit more yeah

101:15 - guys okay and those of you
101:17 - who are on youtube don't worry about it
101:19 - we'll figure this portion out
101:20 - so let's go ahead and create the div
101:22 - we're gonna we'll need to create the
101:24 - difficult main section banner so i'm
101:26 - gonna say here
101:27 - div div class is equal to
101:31 - main dash section dash banner
101:34 - okay that's going to be our
101:37 - main section banner div right and for
101:40 - this main such a better div we're going
101:41 - to give it a height and we're going to
101:42 - give it a
101:43 - width as well all right uh so let's give
101:46 - it a high jessie and this height is
101:48 - going to be
101:52 - let me see where it is yeah about 10
101:56 - i would say or wait no bigger yeah
102:00 - i would say probably h of 44. yeah i
102:03 - would say probably h of dash 44
102:04 - 44 indeed yeah right that's right that's
102:06 - right yeah
102:08 - honestly that's that's a that's kind of
102:10 - the most the most of it
102:12 - um but once we've once we've got that
102:15 - that's that's only to focus on right
102:17 - because here's why here's why um i'm
102:20 - gonna save this here for a second and
102:22 - i'm going to go to my style assistant
102:23 - remember how we link the stylus css so
102:25 - you see this style sheet right here
102:27 - where do we we have this style sheet
102:28 - which is coming from tail and css
102:30 - let's link our own style the css because
102:33 - here's why
102:34 - so i'm going to go ahead and do link
102:37 - rel is that is that because
102:41 - we're trying to make a button
102:44 - browse products on top of an image
102:48 - that's right that's right that's right
102:50 - so i'm gonna say here
102:51 - i'm gonna say style.css right there
102:54 - okay that's right and then inside of my
102:56 - own install this is css i'm gonna say
102:58 - main what is it called main
103:03 - section banner dash banner
103:07 - okay banner
103:11 - right there and now i'm going to give
103:13 - the background image guys this is where
103:15 - this difference is the reason why it's
103:16 - not our html because we're given the
103:17 - background
103:18 - because why we have things on top of it
103:21 - you see
103:22 - we have this is going to be a background
103:24 - image and then this
103:25 - button is on top of that background
103:27 - image so that's why we're doing a
103:28 - background image on there
103:29 - so to make a background image we say
103:31 - background
103:32 - dashboard dash image
103:36 - and all we do is what we say
103:40 - url we give it a url and the url is just
103:43 - the url that we got which is going to be
103:45 - this one right here
103:46 - those of you who are on youtube feel
103:47 - free to feel free to figure that figure
103:49 - to copy paste that one thank you for
103:51 - adding those parentheses
103:52 - that's awesome if we save that now
103:56 - and we go back to amazon 2.0 nothing's
103:58 - going to happen
104:00 - nothing absolutely nothing
104:04 - because why and i'm trying to figure out
104:07 - why actually right now but
104:09 - i know why because of flex it's because
104:12 - of flex so if we we need to kind of go
104:16 - back to the main screen and we need to
104:19 - say flex on it
104:21 - so here's if i go to insta.html and i go
104:24 - to my
104:25 - main section i inside here i'm going to
104:29 - say
104:30 - hr44 but i'm going to say with
104:34 - with dash full
104:38 - okay do you have any of that no uh
104:41 - not necessarily no no no
104:45 - let me go right click inspect download
104:46 - this one let's see what's going on in
104:48 - here
104:49 - so it's not showing up for some reason
104:51 - but i'm sure there's a reason for it
104:54 - so main okay main is good
104:57 - get the sidebar we got the main section
104:59 - oh that's why
105:01 - that's why that's why that's why that's
105:03 - that's why why
105:05 - why why that's right so what's going on
105:07 - here is look at this
105:08 - so you guys pay attention this okay you
105:11 - see what's going on here is that we have
105:12 - flex
105:13 - right here okay and so this is right
105:15 - here the full
105:16 - this whole full thing that's flex right
105:19 - right there right then let me go and
105:23 - make that happen again so you guys can
105:24 - see it
105:27 - okay we have sidebar categories oh
105:31 - they're com nice huh
105:35 - what they're coming to get you i know i
105:38 - know i know so i'm just gonna come in
105:42 - together
105:44 - okay so we have the main section
105:47 - and then we have the main section banner
105:50 - okay um but here's the thing
105:53 - so this main section guys has no width
105:57 - right now
105:57 - because if you see it look at this
105:59 - [Music]
106:01 - so main section right nothing
106:04 - right i look at the sidebar it has a
106:05 - width but this has nothing
106:07 - it's zero it has a height which is great
106:09 - but it's zero
106:10 - well how do we make it a width of 100 or
106:14 - how do we make it sure
106:15 - that this main section just takes out
106:17 - the rest of the width
106:19 - honestly it's not that hard because
106:22 - with flex if i go to tillman css
106:25 - and i say for example flex
106:31 - flex it says flex that's right flex 1
106:33 - flex 1 is what's going to make sure that
106:35 - it actually stretches out as much as
106:36 - possible
106:37 - so i will go back to my application here
106:41 - ah so if we give it a flex one the main
106:45 - section
106:45 - will take up all of the remaining space
106:48 - that is available that's right
106:49 - that's right so i'm gonna say flex one
106:55 - so i'm going to save that hey you see
106:57 - right there see just like that
106:59 - oh there we go i know i know hey
107:02 - but you're part of that so i'm like yay
107:06 - yeah yeah i still i still got my still
107:09 - not got my groove you know
107:10 - that's good so let's go back to the main
107:13 - section let's also give it some padding
107:15 - guys because i like that padding right
107:16 - here
107:17 - i'm gonna say padding i'm gonna say
107:18 - padding dash
107:20 - six right that's going to push
107:23 - everything to the side
107:24 - all right good next thing you know we
107:26 - have the image inside here which is
107:28 - great that's exactly what we want to
107:29 - have
107:30 - but we need to center the image because
107:32 - right now just kind of wonky just kind
107:34 - of everywhere which i don't like
107:35 - so if we go inside the css and instead
107:37 - of doing a background image like this
107:39 - i'm going to say the following
107:40 - i'm going to say background position
107:43 - center
107:47 - so right away you see it's going to
107:48 - position the back on center
107:50 - but then the following and i'm then i'm
107:51 - going to say background
107:53 - size cover and so we'll cover
107:57 - what cover does okay just and pay
108:00 - attention to this cover is going to try
108:02 - to fill up as much of the
108:06 - container as possible while making sure
108:08 - that it does
108:09 - fill it all up so basically you will
108:11 - know exactly that it will fill it all up
108:13 - but i will try to fill it up so as much
108:15 - as possible so the width
108:17 - of the actual image is always going to
108:19 - be a hundred percent
108:21 - of the width of the pant container right
108:23 - that's why that's so important
108:25 - and so then we're going to do if we go
108:27 - back to inside html
108:28 - this makes sense better in order to make
108:30 - a round what do we do
108:32 - guys tell me what do you do to make a
108:33 - round who remembers who remembers what
108:35 - do we do
108:36 - who remembers
108:40 - radius that's right we do radius but
108:42 - until still says who can figure out what
108:44 - we do until in css
108:46 - yeah that's right so we can do rounded
108:49 - that's right we'll do rounded
108:52 - dash lg actually i'm gonna say rounded
108:57 - let me see i'm gonna say rounded dash
109:00 - lg
109:03 - oh save that and nothing's going on
109:06 - right now as well
109:07 - oh wait what happened here
109:11 - hey actually it is there we go rounded
109:14 - dash lg
109:16 - there we go that looks pretty pretty
109:18 - dang good okay
109:19 - so then the next thing we need to do
109:21 - after that is we need to add that
109:23 - browse product so let's go ahead jesse
109:24 - let's go ahead and add that button jesse
109:28 - yeah for sure so the button i always
109:31 - like to make the buttons myself you know
109:32 - so i'm going to give it a div class i'm
109:34 - going to call it button
109:36 - okay and yeah the text inside of the
109:39 - button of course is going to be
109:41 - browse products so inside of this div
109:43 - i'm just going to say
109:45 - browse products okay
109:48 - like that very simple okay then of
109:51 - course i'm going to style
109:52 - the button up what's the background
109:54 - color it is white
109:56 - so i'm always starting off with
109:57 - background color which is background
109:58 - white
109:59 - i know that the width
110:03 - is i'm going to give it the 36 and i'm
110:05 - going to give a height of
110:06 - 10 okay so i should see something
110:10 - square come up boom there it is nice
110:13 - it's super ugly boom but let's make it
110:16 - better okay
110:18 - there it is we're gonna make it rounded
110:22 - okay and i think it's for full rounded
110:25 - because it has
110:26 - it's like a full circle
110:33 - yes but as you can see the browse
110:36 - products the word
110:38 - those words are not like centered right
110:41 - so it's
110:42 - super ugly still so i'm going to give it
110:45 - a flex
110:46 - i'm going to say justify center and i'm
110:49 - going to say
110:50 - items center so it is totally in the
110:53 - middle of that button
110:55 - okay in the middle of that do i need to
110:58 - i think i need to give it some
111:00 - padding is that correct no no you're
111:02 - good you're good you're good that's
111:03 - working correct
111:04 - yeah okay i think then on
111:07 - the left side i'm going to give it some
111:09 - margin four
111:11 - okay so it doesn't touch the left
111:15 - side i think did it help of course it is
111:18 - going to help well
111:19 - i did yes i did but also but it also
111:22 - added margin to the top so make sure
111:24 - it's margin left for jesse
111:28 - okay oh margin left four okay sorry
111:30 - about that okay
111:32 - okay nice good and okay let's give it a
111:35 - cursor pointer because once we're
111:37 - you know hovering over the button we
111:40 - wanted to get that little hand
111:42 - plus guess what that button
111:45 - is now at the top of the banner
111:49 - mm-hmm so how do we make it so how do we
111:51 - switch that
111:53 - so the button if you if you you could
111:56 - either
111:57 - like we're centering uh like we're
111:59 - centering things vertically
112:02 - you can also put things at the end
112:04 - vertically
112:05 - that's interesting so on the parent

114:14 - those okay
114:14 - um
114:18 - yeah this one's so fun these categories
114:21 - so
114:22 - we've got the main section we've got the
114:23 - main section better let's create another
114:25 - div here
114:26 - div i'm going to call it class it's
114:29 - equal to
114:30 - mean mean
114:34 - i want to section
114:39 - yes and i'm going to create one last div
114:43 - here
114:44 - that's going to represent the hot deals
114:47 - okay
114:48 - the hot hot hot deals so
114:51 - i'm gonna say do inside here div class
114:55 - is equal to what so it's not funny i
114:57 - mean
114:58 - the section dash deals
115:02 - that's okay let's close this one up
115:05 - save that in there all good all good oh
115:08 - good
115:08 - that's looking great let's focus now on
115:11 - the popular category so what do we have
115:12 - in there well
115:13 - the first thing we need to take a look
115:14 - at is we've got this text popular
115:16 - categories
115:17 - and then we have a few of these little
115:19 - svg icons that represent the categories
115:22 - okay so let's create the text first
115:24 - jesse okay
115:25 - let's create our text first yep
115:28 - so very simple guys again i'm just going
115:31 - to say
115:32 - start off with an h1 class and i'm going
115:34 - to say
115:35 - popular oops that it has to be inside of
115:38 - it of course that's right yeah
115:39 - otherwise otherwise popular
115:42 - categories okay and again
115:46 - i can style this up of course
115:50 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
115:52 - say clause
115:55 - and let's give it that popular
115:57 - categories
115:58 - tag okay and
116:02 - first of all what i notice about this is
116:05 - it's a bold font okay so we're going to
116:09 - say fon
116:10 - bold again how you get that is if you go
116:12 - to tail and css
116:14 - if you say bold for example
116:17 - right that gives you right there see
116:19 - font bold and that just translates to a
116:21 - css class
116:22 - property called font weight 700 that's
116:24 - it
116:26 - and it's so easy to work with that guys
116:28 - because once you know these utility
116:30 - classes once you know the name of it you
116:31 - just go like oh
116:32 - phone bold or font extra bold or
116:35 - whatsoever
116:40 - so that's it let's continue okay fawn
116:44 - bold
116:45 - and then text gray
116:49 - 700 whoops oh good
116:52 - so text create that's right text create
116:54 - 700 and then
116:56 - once you've got i'm going to save that
117:00 - yep save that all right beautiful all
117:02 - right
117:03 - let's give it a bigger font size can you
117:05 - give it a bug bigger font size jesse
117:06 - awesome yeah you can so that's very easy
117:09 - until when you can just say
117:10 - text and normally you can say xl but if
117:13 - you want it really big
117:15 - twice as big you say 2xl your light just
117:18 - keeps falling it's so funny
117:22 - then there was light lights i am the
117:24 - light okay
117:26 - so that said guys now we have
117:30 - popular categories but what else do we
117:32 - see next to popular category
117:34 - i don't know we see a star guess what
117:38 - a star oh do i get a star star like the

118:21 - that's right so straight so pretty so
118:24 - what do we do now with that star though
118:25 - jesse
118:31 - well a few things we need to make sure
118:32 - we need to make sure it's from left to
118:34 - right so the first thing to do
118:35 - is the fact that i'm going to say hey
118:37 - you know what flex it
118:38 - flex it yeah flex it
118:42 - um wait are you going to flex
118:46 - no inside i would i would flex it inside

118:49 - sv popular popular category
118:53 - yeah okay okay okay so okay yeah that's
118:56 - fine
118:56 - that works too sometimes yeah that works
118:58 - too so
118:59 - i put the svgs at the each h1 guys okay
119:02 - there we go yeah all right so that it's
119:05 - the same color as the popular categories
119:07 - and then i'm going to say flex on the
119:10 - each one
119:12 - yeah on each one i'm going to say item
119:16 - center yes boom there you go
119:20 - oh guys look at that now the categories
119:24 - popular categories
119:25 - h1 is perfectly aligned with the star
119:28 - next to it due to flex and item center
119:32 - okay and justify let's go ali auntism
119:35 - there
119:35 - sorry so that said guys
119:38 - let's change up the star to be honest
119:41 - because the star
119:42 - is a little bit on maybe the big side
119:46 - what do you think not yeah so i'm gonna
119:47 - say let's go and give it a class
119:49 - jesse yeah
119:52 - yeah and then um a height of six
119:56 - and
120:00 - change it to
120:03 - yellow so text yellow 400.
120:07 - okay can we save this oh get the glories
120:09 - that's an interesting one
120:11 - that's a glorious that's not correct
120:14 - yeah so let's save that one good
120:18 - something happened with that one popular
120:20 - cat
120:21 - so somebody said there's already class
120:22 - in svg sometimes tailwind indeed
120:25 - already gives his own class so you need
120:26 - to remove that second class only have
120:29 - one class in your svg there we go
120:32 - popular okay guys
120:33 - okay good i like i'm liking that one
120:36 - okay
120:37 - so it looks pretty good now however
120:41 - always when you work with text or when
120:43 - you work with sexiest guys there's
120:45 - always
120:45 - one thing you always want to make sure
120:47 - which is like we did with the other
120:49 - things
120:50 - spacing oh yes it's okay right that's so
120:53 - important
120:55 - so let's give this main section
120:57 - categories at the
120:58 - total top you know so it's not touching
121:01 - the banner
121:02 - here but i'm highlighting here let's
121:05 - give this a margin bottom
121:07 - of 10. okay
121:11 - let's see what happens now
121:16 - no so the main
121:19 - section category i think what you want
121:21 - to do instead on this one
121:23 - is let me see margin bottom 10.
121:29 - oh it's not live reloading i think
121:30 - that's why
121:32 - oh yeah open live live server let me see
121:35 - the chat one time
121:37 - no the same thing so inspect element
121:39 - let's see let's see what's going on it's
121:40 - okay you can always find out what's
121:41 - going on here
121:44 - just by looking into it so we got the h1
121:47 - which is here we've got the main
121:49 - a qualities oh okay so it's not
121:51 - respecting
121:52 - the main section so um okay that makes
121:55 - sense that makes sense why
121:56 - i see i see where it's coming from okay
121:59 - instead what i would do sometime instead
122:00 - of doing like a margin
122:01 - uh margin bottom on the main categories
122:05 - what i would do is actually margin top
122:06 - i think that's a little bit better
122:07 - instead of down instead of doing that ah
122:09 - okay
122:09 - sorry wait margin top
122:12 - so save that there we go my live surfer
122:16 - working
122:16 - oh yeah okay on top that's right
122:19 - so we've got the popular categories
122:21 - there next thing we need to do
122:22 - is we need to create these little icons
122:25 - this is going to be really interesting
122:26 - so let's go and create those icons jesse
122:27 - okay
122:28 - so yeah you go ahead and do that
122:31 - i would first um i would first have more
122:34 - control i would
122:35 - put all of these icons in another diff
122:38 - okay so i'm going to make a diff class
122:40 - called categories
122:42 - okay categories
122:47 - and inside of these div categories
122:53 - so like this guys be a little patient
122:55 - and then of course we're gonna put
122:58 - each icon inside of this diff called
123:00 - categories okay
123:02 - so the first one is an icon of let's
123:04 - call it
123:05 - um desktop okay so icon desktop
123:09 - okay and we're going to give it a height
123:12 - of 20
123:13 - and a width of 20. okay
123:16 - let's start our start off with this
123:18 - first okay so wait 20
123:20 - okay and then close this off and inside
123:23 - of the div
123:24 - of course we're going to have an svg
123:27 - class okay we're gonna have an svg class
123:31 - and guess what we are taking that spg
123:33 - class
123:34 - from the tailwind heroly icons
123:37 - library there we go okay i'm gonna paste
123:40 - it into here
123:41 - done thank you what a service wow
123:45 - so good that said inside of this
123:48 - svg we're gonna give it also
123:52 - a certain height and width again okay so
123:54 - spd
123:55 - class height or h12
124:00 - w12 okay plus
124:03 - we don't want it to stay what is it now
124:05 - black we want it to be
124:07 - um grayish okay so text gray
124:10 - 500. okay and this is the
124:14 - spg itself that's right but look
124:17 - if we look at our design we saw that
124:21 - they have like white surroundings around
124:23 - it
124:24 - like a white background okay so let's go
124:27 - back to the
124:28 - on line 115 as you can see here
124:32 - to the icon and let's give it a
124:35 - background of white
124:38 - save that to make it rounded so
124:41 - rounded excel
124:44 - and are we seeing something now i see
124:48 - anything just yet and i know why it's
124:50 - because the actual
124:51 - background of this whole main section is
124:53 - very different
124:54 - so you see what we need to do because if
124:56 - you do background white
124:58 - it's not it's still white because the
125:00 - whole background is white the whole
125:01 - thing is white
125:02 - so what we need to do is we need to
125:04 - change the background of the whole
125:05 - actual main section
125:07 - and then that changes a lot yeah a lot
125:09 - of things exactly sorry that's right
125:11 - section that line 101 indeed has a
125:14 - background of
125:15 - grayish that's right so if i go to let's
125:20 - see
125:20 - scroll back up where is it
125:23 - if i go to the main site that's right so
125:25 - it's actually background g
125:26 - bg gray is it 900 or is it 100
125:30 - huh no 100 100 thank you so let's save
125:34 - that
125:34 - 100 there we go see very big difference
125:37 - you see now we have that's there
125:39 - okay now we've got the white color so
125:41 - the
125:42 - difference from everything else now we
125:44 - need to do is we want to go ahead and
125:45 - actually center
125:46 - the desktop icon in between the whole
125:48 - div so let's do that right now jesse
125:50 - right so flex justify center you guys
125:54 - know the drill by now
125:55 - items center
125:59 - okay boom the desktop should be come
126:02 - into the middle
126:03 - nice there we go beautiful okay let's
126:06 - add a margin bottom
126:08 - on the whole thing okay let's do margin
126:10 - bottom
126:12 - margin bottom dash what five maybe
126:16 - yeah something like that it's never it's
126:18 - never
126:19 - uh actually i think it's cause something
126:20 - t flex
126:26 - never actually listens to me can i go so
126:28 - if i do categories right
126:30 - and lots of categories and i do marginal
126:31 - bottom
126:33 - it's because it's just not um
126:35 - [Music]
126:36 - let me just think here for a second
126:40 - hmm i don't i don't really see what's
126:42 - happening so i always make
126:43 - i always make things visible so let's
126:46 - give it a color
126:48 - oh i know why it's margin top guys holy
126:51 - moly
126:52 - my bad oh yeah there you go that makes
126:56 - sense
126:56 - okay great great margin top five okay
127:00 - good
127:00 - so we've got one icon let's go and
127:02 - continue to do the same thing but for
127:04 - the other icons right jesse
127:06 - right right right right right so
127:09 - um let's go to the next one okay
127:14 - we're gonna make this a little bit
127:15 - faster okay guys the next one is gonna
127:17 - be
127:17 - a gift right so icon
127:21 - gift and again i actually i'm just gonna
127:24 - copy paste the top here
127:27 - okay the top so i'm just kind of copied
127:30 - what i had on line 115 i'm just going to
127:33 - copy that
127:34 - and put it here boom
127:36 - [Music]
127:38 - and then inside of here i would have i
127:40 - would need that gift
127:42 - um svg so let's go back to here okay
127:46 - let's go to gift gift
127:50 - i'll be using this one or this one or
127:51 - the solid one
127:54 - we're using the solid one okay so copy
127:57 - svg
127:58 - oh you already got it never mind
128:02 - yeah so we've got we've got so again
128:04 - guys when you have the svg
128:09 - when you got the svg you're going to
128:11 - give it a height and a width
128:13 - of 12 just like we did with the previous
128:15 - icon
128:17 - and you're going to give it a text gray
128:19 - of 500.
128:21 - and that's it guys you're going to
128:22 - repeat this process
128:24 - uh another one two three four five times
128:29 - okay we also can need to we can also
128:32 - remove this class right here we don't
128:33 - need this class anymore which comes
128:35 - default
128:36 - right here what i would actually do
128:39 - jesse is i would actually copy the whole
128:41 - thing
128:41 - so copy this whole div okay yeah
128:45 - okay paste five times
128:48 - one two three four
128:53 - five awesome let me go back to amazon
128:57 - oh okay
129:00 - so okay what do we know now they're both
129:03 - vertical
129:04 - how do we make them horizontal well we
129:05 - know that the drill at this point it's
129:06 - going to be using flex
129:08 - right so we go to main section and then
129:10 - we say
129:11 - flex on here wait no not here
129:15 - we need to go to the category section no
129:17 - no on categories
129:19 - that's right yeah there we go
129:22 - nice nice nice beautiful beautiful okay
129:24 - one other thing we need to add is also
129:26 - margin or as a padding or margin right
129:29 - on every single category
129:30 - okay so let's do that as well
129:34 - but i would start doing that not from
129:36 - the first
129:38 - from the second one second icon on
129:42 - so from the second one i'm going to add
129:44 - to each
129:45 - icon i'm going to add
129:48 - a margin of 6. so guys this is a very
129:52 - neat trick which you can do
129:53 - in vs code you can select a word it has
129:56 - to be unique though
129:57 - it has to be unique so if you can see me
129:59 - highlighted i'm highlighting
130:01 - items hyphen center
130:04 - with a carrot next to it and then i'm
130:07 - going to say
130:08 - command and d d d
130:11 - d and you can see my cursor multiplying
130:15 - do you see that
130:18 - we don't really see it but probably it's
130:20 - there
130:22 - now you can do this ml oh shoot
130:26 - within the m quotes ml margin left
130:30 - of six
130:33 - so instead of adding margin right jesse
130:35 - added a margin left
130:36 - on on the second there are other icons
130:38 - okay so
130:39 - but there boom right there the only

135:07 - products which are
135:08 - these ones right here you see i'm just
135:09 - putting them into one div that's all i'm
135:11 - doing so i can put a margin around them

135:17 - is equal to main dash section
135:20 - dash products
135:25 - product good so the products and

135:53 - image
135:54 - okay let's go and create the product
135:56 - image and then after that let's go to
135:58 - create a product
135:59 - name so let me let me cover that hold on
136:02 - just
136:02 - just hold that just so hold on hold on
136:04 - sorry sorry something we just
136:06 - type each other div class is equal to

136:33 - one what we have is what
136:34 - div uh class product dash rating
136:41 - okay which just stepping right now and
136:43 - the last one is going to be df class
136:44 - product dash
136:45 - price okay div class
136:48 - equals product
136:52 - product price okay
136:56 - okay we got that those are the four
136:58 - things we need to write and make
137:00 - work right now for the following
137:04 - uh deal right if you think about this we
137:06 - have a product image
137:08 - that in the product image what do we
137:09 - have guys what do we have in the product
137:10 - image
137:11 - what do you guys think well we have an
137:13 - actual image right so i'm going to say
137:15 - this
137:16 - let's say image class
137:20 - no class for now just empty class for
137:22 - now most problem i'm going to give it a
137:24 - source
137:25 - okay where am i going to get this source
137:27 - good question
137:28 - if i simply just go for example this is
137:30 - a nintendo switch if i go to google
137:34 - google if i just type in for example
137:35 - untitled switch
137:39 - then tendo so you can see i already
137:41 - typed it in beforehand
137:42 - right there that's so fun the nintendo
137:46 - switch i love to play mario kart yeah
137:48 - i've never played it no yeah you click
137:51 - on the title switch
137:52 - right click on these images copy image
137:55 - address
137:56 - and boom source is going to be equal
137:59 - that one so source is equal to
138:00 - that image address but we see that's it
138:03 - guys that's it
138:04 - so now if i go back to my document
138:07 - holy moly that's a big image
138:11 - that's okay that's it i know it's part
138:14 - of the deal
138:16 - that's right so then for the product
138:19 - name we got what nintendo switch so
138:21 - let's do that right now
138:24 - nintendo switch you can see how this
138:27 - turns around so fast
138:30 - 2019 there we go the product make is
138:33 - going to be nintendo
138:36 - good the product reading now these are
138:38 - the stars okay
138:40 - where do we get the stars well if you
138:41 - simply just type in star emoji
138:44 - star emoji
138:47 - again it just makes it easier for us
138:51 - boom star emoji i'm going to go this
138:54 - emoji star
138:55 - and i'm going to copy this star that's
138:58 - it just command c
139:00 - and then ctrl c if you're on windows and
139:02 - that's it so command c
139:04 - and now let's do how many stars you guys
139:06 - want to get from the nintendo switch how
139:07 - many stars you guys want to give them
139:08 - you guys want to be nice because oh five
139:10 - for sure how many stars
139:12 - come up four point five three point five
139:16 - four point oh damn you guys lied into
139:18 - the switch huh all right so i'm going to
139:19 - do one two three four
139:21 - five i'm going to say 4.5 how does that
139:23 - not now 5.4 4.5 right there
139:26 - okay i know and the product
139:30 - price is going to be 290 so i'm going to
139:32 - say
139:33 - here it's going to be like this
139:36 - 290 flat it's actually 290 i don't
139:40 - remember
139:41 - but that's okay right so we got that
139:44 - portion and if we
139:44 - look at our amazon it's pretty
139:48 - horrible right especially this image
139:50 - which looks
139:51 - horrible of all but this is where we can
139:53 - fix that because it's all dependent on
139:55 - how we do it
139:56 - okay so if we look at the main product
139:59 - okay and all we got to do is just add a
140:02 - width
140:03 - so i'm going to go to my my product
140:05 - image i'm going to say width
140:06 - is going to be 48 okay and the height is
140:10 - going to be
140:11 - 52 right
140:14 - and okay right there see i think a lot
140:17 - of things now change
140:18 - right things now change really really
140:19 - fast okay i'm going to give it a bg
140:21 - white for background color of white
140:26 - okay let me see save it
140:30 - come on zodie come on all right just
140:33 - doesn't like it no
140:35 - speech that's right no okay that's fine
140:38 - i'll just open life over again
140:40 - such as it happens first because you
140:42 - know we use like these really
140:43 - complicated live share programs and so
140:45 - it kind of happens sometimes
140:47 - it's okay not the worst of the cases
140:51 - all right okay bg white
140:54 - next thing what we're going to do after
140:56 - that one is we're going to give it a
140:57 - rounded section so i'm going to say
140:59 - rhonda lg
141:02 - dash lg dash lg that gives it a rounded
141:06 - corners
141:07 - okay and then um just
141:10 - i don't think that's it now the question
141:12 - i want us to figure out is
141:14 - how do we make sure let me ask you this
141:16 - how do we
141:17 - put this in the center this image in the
141:19 - center of everything
141:20 - right how do we do that what do you guys
141:22 - think
141:23 - how do you put this image the center of
141:24 - everything and there's a few ways to do
141:26 - it by the way
141:27 - there's a few ways to do it
141:31 - let's fuse to it so one of the ways to
141:33 - do it is to actually give it a width and
141:35 - height so
141:36 - if i go to the image and i say hey the
141:38 - width of this
141:39 - is going to be w dash uh
141:43 - full which is weight of width of 100
141:48 - and a height of full which is a height
141:51 - of 100
141:52 - and then i can do object contain guys
141:54 - object dash
141:56 - contain you see
141:59 - boom now it's in the center then if i
142:02 - add a padding tool at the same time
142:05 - like this and i say for example um on
142:08 - the actual uh what's called the actual
142:10 - image i say
142:10 - you know what let's do a padding let's
142:12 - do a padding of four
142:15 - p dash four it's going to push the image
142:17 - in
142:18 - and boom you see a lot a lot better
142:21 - it's time to look a lot better wow
142:22 - that's so unclean
142:25 - let's go to a product name and inside
142:27 - the product name what do we know well
142:29 - one is let's go ahead and change the uh
142:31 - color so i'm gonna say
142:32 - text dash gray
142:35 - dash what 700
142:39 - so change the color first let's make it
142:41 - bold so i'm gonna say font dash
142:43 - bold save that
142:46 - okay great now it's bold let's do a
142:49 - margin top two just to give some spacing
142:54 - great all right and honestly it's gonna
142:56 - make it
142:57 - the text small so text dash sm
143:01 - oh okay much better next one nintendo
143:04 - is gonna be uh that's the actual make so
143:06 - let's do
143:07 - change the color to text green
143:11 - you see how easy it is to be changing
143:13 - all these different things so once you
143:14 - start to know
143:15 - all these classes 700 it's as green as
143:18 - your green screen naz
143:20 - huh it says green is your green i know
143:23 - same type of green
143:24 - i know i'll put voice over again it just
143:28 - keeps
143:29 - coming in and out for some reason i
143:30 - don't know why but that's okay
143:32 - okay and the product rating are we going
143:34 - to make that yellow
143:36 - yes yeah so text yellow
143:40 - how what's the number
143:43 - 300 300 300 okay right but we're not
143:46 - done with this product made because i
143:48 - want to make sure it's font bold as well
143:50 - so let's say font
143:51 - dash bold for this one nice
143:54 - and honestly that's pretty much it then
143:56 - for the rating
143:57 - we're gonna what give it a margin y of
144:00 - one so
144:01 - m y and y
144:05 - one there we go that gives us some
144:06 - spacing which is really good and then
144:08 - honestly that's it uh for that one and
144:11 - for
144:12 - the price let's go ahead and do also
144:15 - font dash bold
144:17 - right we'll do text gray
144:21 - dash 700 nice i'm going to text lodge
144:24 - for this one
144:26 - so guys you see here on line 171 you see
144:31 - mi hyphen one it means
144:34 - margin over the uh the y-axis
144:38 - so that means vertically so it's
144:40 - actually
144:41 - margin guess what top
144:44 - and bottom that's it top and bottom
144:48 - so if you would do from left to right it
144:50 - would be mx
144:53 - but we don't want to use that but that's
144:54 - just to show you how easy it is
144:56 - to use that until wind that's right and
144:58 - to learn that okay that's right that's
145:00 - right that's right
145:00 - so really cool with that so guys look we
145:03 - have done one product
145:04 - and now we all have to do is just
145:06 - replicate it and it's super easy
145:08 - because all i gotta do is copy pasta
145:12 - i know but don't worry later on
145:15 - i know what we could give at homework
145:17 - what
145:20 - well we could copy paste this but then
145:23 - they would have to fill in the details
145:27 - of the hot deals and they could even
145:29 - make hot
145:30 - their own hot deals that's good so maybe
145:33 - they actually do copy pasta they figure
145:35 - out their own products
145:37 - and then make sure it's from left to
145:38 - right that could be good too i kind of i
145:40 - like that i like the idea okay they
145:42 - could do that
145:42 - yeah so let's do this how about this go
145:44 - to hot deals i'm gonna do margin top
145:46 - here
145:47 - okay just to give us a margin top for
145:48 - the hot deal section
145:51 - okay i'm going to say mt dash 10 maybe
145:54 - or there's five
145:58 - there we go that's about it right jesse
146:01 - yeah
146:02 - that's about it there we go that's about
146:04 - it no no you now you have the original

146:23 - right got hot deals so for homework what
146:26 - i want you guys later on to do to

146:55 - yeah
146:56 - anything else guys as you can see there
146:58 - was a lot of things that we repeated
147:01 - like by now if we want to line something
147:04 - up
147:04 - horizontally next to each other flex
147:07 - if you want to get it horizontally
147:09 - aligned in the center justify center
147:12 - or vertically item center so that sort
147:15 - of things throughout the video even if

147:18 - you'll be sick of hearing that at some
147:20 - point so even though we get went fast
