00:00 - so why the best programmers are broke
00:04 - and one of the main things is so
00:08 - basically you know I'm talking about the
00:10 - people who have been coding let's say
00:11 - for 30 years and their rate is 30
00:14 - dollars an hour and I know that because
00:18 - I actually had a few coding pewters or
00:21 - mentors that I had hired and I was
00:24 - working with and that was a rate they
00:26 - were charging and worked very closely
00:29 - with them for a few for a few years
00:32 - actually and I was looking at so I had
00:36 - one mentor who was essentially broke who
00:39 - was a great coder with 30 years of
00:42 - experience making $30 an hour then I had
00:45 - another mentor who had you know only few
00:49 - years of coding experience but then he
00:51 - was charging 150 to $200 an hour as a
00:55 - Python consultant he even had clients
00:57 - who charge $300 an hour as a Python
01:00 - consultant and that's what made me you
01:03 - know started thinking about okay hmm you
01:07 - can have somebody who has 15 13 30 years
01:11 - of experience and you can have somebody
01:13 - who has less experience and are actually
01:15 - less hot you know less good coders
01:19 - they're not as good as somebody else who
01:21 - has 30 years of experience but how are
01:23 - they when it comes to the pay so
01:26 - different like what is the difference
01:28 - they live in the same country they live
01:30 - in the same state they live in the same
01:31 - city they have a room to apply to the
01:35 - same pool of jobs so what's with the
01:38 - disparity why is one guy making five
01:40 - times as much and other guy making five
01:44 - times as less why does it take one
01:47 - person to do in five years what it takes
01:51 - other person to do in one year why does
01:54 - it take one person to do in two years
01:57 - what it takes other person to do in 10
02:00 - years what the hell is the difference so
02:06 - here's it what in my opinion what the
02:10 - difference is
02:16 - it's a lot of self limiting belief that
02:19 - people put on themselves okay and it's a
02:22 - lot of here's what the most important
02:25 - thing that I think people overlook 85%
02:29 - of your financial success and listen to
02:34 - this very carefully and if you're
02:36 - watching this live stream here's what I
02:38 - suggest
02:39 - bring bring some notes with you bring a
02:41 - notepad and take some notes all right
02:44 - write down what I'm saying and this will
02:46 - really really help you 85% of your
02:51 - financial success comes from your
02:56 - personal likeability your interpersonal
03:02 - skills your people skills your
03:07 - negotiation skills all right and the
03:13 - other 15% of your financial success
03:17 - comes from your technical skills how
03:24 - crazy is that and this is it this is
03:27 - according to Carnegie Mellon University
03:28 - they did a research and that's what they
03:30 - put out and I think it's true
03:36 - it's the 80/20 rule 85 15 in this case
03:41 - but that's really what it is quality of
03:44 - work of course it matters your
03:47 - dedication of course it matters your
03:49 - time of course it matters but how come
03:52 - the dude who's put 30 years into coding
03:54 - and literally codes every single day has
03:58 - eyebags underneath his eyes doesn't even
04:01 - change his shirt like this guy literally
04:03 - was my mentor and I hope he's not
04:05 - watching it um and I love him to death
04:08 - but he literally wore a blue hoodie
04:11 - every single session we've ever had okay
04:16 - and like had crazy eye bags under his
04:20 - eyes and he was the best coder I've
04:22 - literally ever seen okay this guy was
04:25 - like
04:26 - wizard he'd been coding since he was
04:28 - five years old and he'd been coding all
04:30 - the way through and his work experience
04:32 - was 30 years I imagine that you've been
04:34 - coding from five since you were five
04:36 - years old and then you also have
04:38 - professional job experience for 30 years
04:40 - so he was probably coding for over 40
04:43 - years okay
04:48 - yet that was his hourly rate and again
04:51 - you know why is money important a lot of
04:55 - people are like why are you talking
04:57 - about money why do you bring up money so
04:59 - much here's why because I care about you
05:03 - being able to support yourself but not
05:05 - only that you being able to support your
05:08 - family and your friends and get those
05:10 - around you this was something I kind of
05:15 - figured out or it happened to me and I
05:17 - had this realization a while ago and
05:20 - I've told this story where my mom got an
05:23 - accident and I couldn't afford her
05:24 - surgery like literally our family
05:26 - couldn't afford her surgery so for 12
05:28 - years like she just kept being an
05:31 - agonizing pain and me feeling helpless
05:34 - was the moment for me where I realized
05:36 - that I only need a little bit of money
05:39 - to be happy and I just need to eat food
05:41 - and that's pretty much it and I'll be
05:43 - like good but I need to have more for
05:46 - other people around me and not just
05:49 - enough for myself because I think that's
05:51 - selfish to just have enough for yourself
05:53 - so now going back to the two programmers
05:57 - right one making 30 and other making
05:59 - like 200 an hour
06:00 - that's literally one person's one year
06:03 - of work is equal to the other person six
06:05 - years of work so you're saving yourself
06:07 - a lot of time which gives you freedom
06:09 - you're obviously making good money so
06:12 - you get paid what you deserve you're not
06:13 - overworked and underpaid and you can
06:15 - help out everybody else around you and
06:17 - also you're like I said you have that
06:23 - freedom and that freedom is what we
06:26 - really want right that's what we're
06:28 - alternately looking for and here's what
06:32 - I like about it the most when you're
06:34 - getting compensated well for your time
06:36 - you end up having a lot of extra
06:39 - free time and now with that time you can
06:42 - choose to put in a lot more work maybe
06:45 - even build a business on the side or
06:47 - work on really cool coding projects like
06:49 - nerd out whatever but you could work on
06:51 - your own things and that's the freedom
06:55 - that I like you know for example if
06:57 - you're charging let's say let's say
06:59 - you're happy with making $2,000 a month
07:02 - okay let's just talk about some
07:03 - practical math now let's say you're
07:06 - happy and you enjoy making $2,000 a
07:09 - month and you figure it out the - what
07:10 - would keep you happy you could be
07:14 - working 40 hours to make you could be
07:17 - working 40 hours a week to make your
07:20 - $2,000 a month so let's say you could be
07:22 - working 160 hours a month to be making
07:25 - your $2,000 or instead of working
07:30 - hundred and 60 hours a month how about
07:33 - if you had a higher hourly rate that you
07:35 - charged how about you worked for only 40
07:39 - hours and made $2,000 how about instead
07:43 - of your workweek being 40 hours long
07:46 - your workweek was 10 hours long and you
07:50 - get 30 hours extra now you could take
07:53 - that extra 30 hours and put it towards
07:56 - work and now instead of working 10 hours
07:58 - you're working 40 hours but your income
08:00 - instead of it being 2,000 it's now 8,000
08:03 - dollars that's one thing you could do
08:05 - the other thing you could do with that
08:07 - 30 hours is literally start going to the
08:10 - gym that time you complain you don't
08:12 - have enough hours in a day to spend with
08:15 - your family friends or your girlfriend
08:17 - whatever take care of that I don't know
08:22 - the third thing is enjoy your life like
08:26 - travel go to different places go to
08:29 - different states go to different
08:31 - countries see what is going on in the
08:34 - world check out different cultures it's
08:38 - unlimited what you could do at that time
08:40 - so that's why it's important to
08:43 - understand and calculate what your
08:44 - earning potential could look like so you
08:47 - have this clear map because most people
08:50 - what we do is
08:53 - we just applied lots and lots and lots
08:55 - of jobs and then the first one that
08:58 - comes to us we just accept that and it
09:03 - can even be like some really crappy
09:05 - opportunity and then we just go from
09:07 - there right and then we just go day by
09:13 - day not thinking about what we're doing
09:15 - we work we come home we watch stranger
09:17 - things or house of cards and there's
09:20 - nothing wrong with that if you're
09:22 - watching it from a place of just
09:23 - enjoying it but most of the times our
09:26 - lives are so hectic that we literally
09:29 - need to numb the pain by watching some
09:33 - stuff to keep our minds off of the
09:35 - pressure and the headaches and all the
09:38 - problems so we come home from 9:00 to
09:42 - 5:00 a job that we huh
09:44 - we're like it's okay I'm not really
09:46 - feeling it we spend the rest of the time
09:49 - maybe watching a show or something and
09:50 - then we sleep and then we rinse and
09:53 - repeat and go through life like zombies
09:56 - and then we look back and we're like I
09:58 - have an average job that prays an
10:01 - average income I have you know either a
10:07 - partner in life or I maybe don't even
10:09 - have a partner in life I'm physically in
10:13 - just an okay shape if not poor shape and
10:17 - I wish I could do a lot of the things
10:20 - differently and then as soon as that
10:24 - thought creeps into your mind what do
10:26 - you do
10:27 - boom back to Netflix back to watching
10:32 - the TV back to watching your favorite
10:34 - reality show back to calling that best
10:37 - friend that just makes you feel
10:39 - comfortable and feel good and you guys
10:41 - just eat cookies together and you guys
10:43 - just like hang out together and eat ice
10:45 - cream together and both of you try not
10:48 - to remind each other of where were the
10:50 - places where you could have really
10:52 - succeeded and pushed yourself and had
10:55 - that tapped into that potential that you
10:57 - know that you kind of had so
11:02 - again it's important to understand that
11:06 - and not go down that path okay just have
11:11 - always have that in the back of your
11:13 - head and like I say your true friends
11:15 - are not the ones who make you feel
11:16 - comfortable or cuddly or just enjoying
11:19 - yourself
11:20 - those are people you can I mean I
11:24 - honestly hire just hire a therapist or
11:26 - something just pay them hourly to listen
11:28 - to your problems it'll make you feel
11:30 - nice and cushy they'll make you feel
11:32 - cozy you'll be great
11:34 - if you make money you can just hire them
11:36 - that's it that's the type of friends I
11:38 - see a lot of people have just just
11:40 - always trying to make each other feel as
11:42 - comfortable as possible only to then
11:45 - later look back at their life and then
11:46 - regret it I honestly think a true friend
11:49 - is somebody who pushes you and makes you
11:51 - feel uncomfortable not all the time but
11:54 - at times calls you out and it's okay if
11:57 - they make you feel a little
11:58 - uncomfortable but enough to challenge
12:00 - you so you can push yourself forward in
12:03 - in your income in your financial success
12:08 - in your relationships in your you know
12:14 - your body your fitness in your emotional
12:16 - health your mental health whether you do
12:19 - meditation or whatever it is in every
12:22 - aspect of life you should be around
12:24 - people who push you forward and truly
12:27 - care for you that's what it means for
12:29 - somebody to truly care for you like they
12:31 - watch out for you okay so keep that in
12:38 - the back of your mind
12:39 - yeah Netflix Netflix is too expensive
12:41 - for some some of us jaunty so again when
12:44 - you're working on those little apps on
12:47 - the side and you're freelancing you
12:49 - could be making that extra income and
12:51 - then just pay off that Netflix pay off
12:56 - your Hulu subscriptions pay off going to
13:00 - movies pay off those fancy dinner dates
13:03 - pay off your phone bills pay off all
13:06 - these annoying little things that nag at
13:08 - you and even if you you're not ready to
13:11 - make that full jump yet you could be
13:14 - doing this on the side
13:16 - and save yourself time and just be
13:18 - making that extra income to give
13:19 - yourself that breathing
13:22 - [Music]
