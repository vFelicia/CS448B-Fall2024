00:00 - - This is Rafeh Qazi,
also known as Papa Python,
00:04 - from cleverprogrammer.com.
00:06 - There are three main things I
wanna talk about in this video
00:11 - and I'm gonna break 'em down step by step
00:13 - based on in what order
you will need these in.
00:16 - And what I also wanna
show you are the things
00:18 - that give you, they're the
biggest leverage points
00:21 - strategically and tactically for you,
00:22 - that you can actually apply in your life.
00:24 - 'Cause I don't wanna just give you
00:25 - general theoretical information,
00:27 - so I'll also give you specific information
00:29 - to how I use these strategies
to grow my business,
00:32 - or to grow my career
as a Python developer,
00:35 - or a developer in general.
00:37 - (urban music with strong beat)
00:50 - First off, I wanna start off with
00:52 - how to motivate yourself to code.
00:55 - This is very important,
because if you want to
00:57 - shorten your timespan from five years
01:00 - to achieving those things in one year,
01:02 - or three to five years
to achieving those things
01:04 - in one year, or less,
01:06 - what you need to be able to do is,
01:07 - there's no shortcut to hard work.
01:11 - You will have to put in the work.
01:13 - But how you can shortcut that path
01:16 - is by doing that amount
of work in one year
01:19 - instead of three to five years.
01:21 - So now let's talk about how
you can actually do that.
01:24 - One is through motivating
yourself, but let's be real.
01:27 - Motivation doesn't last very long.
01:29 - You'll run out of it,
it has ups and downs,
01:31 - it's really connected to
your emotions and feelings.
01:34 - And it's hard to trust
your emotions and feelings,
01:36 - 'cause sometimes, I'm feeling like crap,
01:38 - like the other day, my friend,
01:40 - one of my really good friends,
one of my best friends,
01:42 - is actually leaving LA,
pretty much permanently,
01:46 - and it kinda like really,
really made me sad,
01:50 - like I had this wave of, almost like
01:53 - tears coming out of my eyes,
01:55 - and I had to suck 'em back
in, I'm like, I'm a man!
01:57 - And it was sad, but the point is,
01:59 - you want to understand that emotions
02:03 - will tell you one thing,
right, so I got sad,
02:05 - but then, what would I have done?
02:07 - Normally, when I would have gone sad,
02:09 - I would have just,
like, not slept on time,
02:11 - stayed up 'til really
late, just watched Netflix
02:14 - and ate a lot of food.
02:15 - But because I have my system set,
02:17 - I'd still slept at 10 p.m.,
I still woke up at 5 a.m.,
02:20 - and I still went on to do the things
02:23 - that I had planned for the
day, and crush the next day,
02:26 - and my feelings completely changed.
02:27 - As soon as I woke up at
5 a.m., had my coffee,
02:29 - went to work out, I was feeling awesome.
02:32 - So what I wanna tell you, when
it comes to coding for you,
02:34 - you want to code every single day,
02:37 - or get to that point as fast as possible.
02:40 - You're not gonna be
able to do that through
02:42 - sheer motivation alone.
02:43 - Motivation will run out.
02:45 - What you wanna do is build
discipline and structure.
02:48 - Let's study something
that helps you create
02:52 - that amount of discipline and structure.
02:53 - One of the best things
for that to study from
02:57 - is to look at how school systems and
02:59 - academic systems work.
03:00 - So, let's take school
and let's deconstruct it.
03:03 - What makes almost
majority of the students,
03:06 - 80-90% of the students go
through grade after grade?
03:11 - Whether they're getting
Ds or Cs or Bs or As,
03:14 - now majority of them are not failing,
03:16 - majority of them are
actually moving forward.
03:18 - So how do they make that rate
03:21 - of people moving forward so high?
03:23 - Let's take a look at a few things.
03:25 - First of all, they have grading in there.
03:28 - So now there's one
layer of accountability,
03:30 - that you're gonna be graded on this.
03:31 - Then there are other
layers of accountability,
03:33 - like the teacher that you respect
03:35 - is gonna be disappointed if
you don't actually show up.
03:37 - Then there's another
layer of accountability,
03:39 - your peer group in school.
03:42 - If you don't show up,
they're gonna be like,
03:43 - hey man, so they're your friends,
you kinda wanna go there,
03:45 - that's your incentive.
03:46 - And then your non-incentives,
like your parents,
03:49 - or some people in your
family getting pissed off,
03:52 - or them eventually saying, like,
03:53 - this person didn't even graduate,
03:55 - the fear of not graduating
and what that would look like
03:58 - on you, so there are these
many different layers.
04:01 - And then on top of that,
you have a schedule,
04:04 - and you have it locked into your calendar,
04:06 - or locked into your curriculum every day,
04:08 - what class you have to show
up for and at what time.
04:11 - And it anchors your day.
04:13 - And eventually it turns into habit,
04:15 - and it's such a strong momentum,
04:17 - that you can't help but show up to school
04:20 - every single day, so think about that.
04:22 - What made you, because a
lot of people are like,
04:24 - Oh, Qazi, I don't know,
I can't code that many
04:27 - hours a day, I don't have
that much motivation.
04:29 - Well, a lot of people don't
have that much motivation
04:31 - to go to school, yet they still go,
04:33 - they still put in the
hours, they still study,
04:35 - and a lot of them still graduate,
04:37 - so they go through the entire process.
04:39 - So you wanna take that system
04:41 - and you want to implement it in your life,
04:43 - so you can code every single day,
04:45 - and you wanna be able to code so much
04:47 - and practice so much
that in one year's time,
04:50 - you do what normally people
do in three to five years.
04:53 - So effectively what I did,
so I went unhealthy amounts
04:57 - of coding hours every single
day, about 10-15 hours.
05:01 - And it allowed me to get
results that take people
05:04 - three to five years,
but it's not a secret,
05:07 - it's just me putting in the amount of work
05:08 - you, or somebody else,
would put in five years.
05:12 - So, that's really the only secret to
05:14 - getting your results faster.
05:16 - Now, what you wanna do is
create discipline and structure
05:20 - so when the layer of
motivation falls away,
05:23 - you're not just left not coding, right?
05:27 - Based on, well, I came home today
05:29 - and I just wasn't feeling like doing it,
05:31 - I just wanted to go to sleep.
05:32 - You know, Qazi, I spent like 10 hours
05:34 - driving my Uber and then when
I come home, I'm so tired.
05:38 - Doesn't matter.
05:39 - Only code for an hour, take a nap,
05:41 - so that when you wake up, you're rested.
05:43 - Look, everybody has to
shift through that phase.
05:46 - I was in that phase, but I
still learned how to code
05:49 - even though I was doing my job
05:51 - and going to school full time.
05:53 - I sacrificed a little bit of sleep,
05:55 - instead of getting eight
hours, I was getting five hours
05:58 - but I created enough time.
05:59 - If you're effective with
your time and focus,
06:02 - you can do a lot, you
don't need that many hours,
06:05 - you just need to be
focused in that time slot.
06:08 - So let's talk about how
you can get freedom.
06:10 - How you can get freedom to
becoming a six figure developer
06:14 - or building your own start-up,
06:15 - or hiring other developers
who can work for you,
06:18 - whatever your dream is,
how you can get freedom
06:21 - is through structure.
06:22 - Structure and discipline and consistency
06:26 - is what will give you your freedom.
06:27 - So now, let's take the school example,
06:30 - how we deconstructed all the
little elements that they add,
06:33 - to add layers of accountability,
06:34 - and layers of discipline,
06:36 - you want to bring that
into your coding life.
06:38 - So for example, here's what you can do.
06:40 - On your calendar, you can put
an hour or two hour blocks
06:44 - of when you should code.
06:47 - And don't do it for a full year,
06:49 - don't do it for three months,
because what I've found,
06:51 - it doesn't work when you
have it on a recurring thing
06:55 - for a whole week.
06:56 - Because you'll do it for
the first day or two,
06:58 - and then it just doesn't mean
anything on your calendar.
07:01 - So what I like to do
is, I like to plan out
07:04 - just one day in advance before sleeping.
07:07 - So, at 9.30 p.m., before falling asleep,
07:11 - I will write down on a yellow legal pad,
07:14 - my exact day, what I'm gonna be doing.
07:16 - So for example, I might
say, 6 a.m., wake up.
07:18 - 6.30 a.m., get ready,
7 a.m., grab breakfast.
07:24 - 7.30 a.m., go to college,
when I was going to college.
07:28 - And all the way down
to, come back at 6 p.m.
07:31 - And then eat or rest 'til 7 p.m.,
07:33 - and from 7.30 p.m. to 9.30
p.m., I would say, code.
07:38 - So this way, very clearly,
07:39 - I visualize what my next day looks like
07:42 - and I have put it into my schedule
07:44 - and it's at the forefront of my mind,
07:46 - so now there's this one
layer of accountability,
07:49 - so to speak, or one anchor that you have.
07:52 - Now what you wanna do is build it up
07:54 - so you're adding more anchors,
07:56 - so then it's impossible for
you to not be able to code
07:59 - every single day, and you
have this giant momentum
08:03 - of habit built up behind you.
08:05 - So, what you wanna do also is something
08:09 - that I found really helpful is,
08:11 - getting one of my friends and finding out
08:13 - one of their goals, and
what they really desire,
08:17 - so for example, you
could take another friend
08:19 - and maybe they're a really good friend
08:21 - but they're not coders.
08:22 - Let's say they want to
study biology, or whatever.
08:26 - So you find out what one of
their goals is for the week,
08:29 - and let's say their goal is for the week
08:31 - to study for the biology
exam or something like that,
08:35 - or maybe they're working on their business
08:37 - and they're thinking about
the new product launch,
08:39 - whatever it may be.
08:40 - Then you tell them your goal
08:42 - and what you have difficulty with,
08:43 - maybe let's say it's
coding and sticking to it.
08:46 - So what you wanna do is
schedule an hour-long call
08:50 - with them in that week,
08:51 - so then for 30 minutes,
you're laser-focused
08:54 - on their problem, and then
that person switches to you
08:58 - and for 30 minutes, they're
laser-focused on your problem,
09:01 - and literally, if it takes
them just watching you
09:04 - and babysitting while
you code, that's enough.
09:07 - And after you get the
30 minutes of momentum,
09:09 - you can end the call and
you're already going.
09:11 - This way, what I find happens is that one,
09:14 - there's a layer of accountability,
09:15 - so you've gotta show up and do it.
09:17 - If you don't show up, that
person's gonna be disappointed,
09:20 - just like in school.
09:21 - And three, you get your
brain focused and dialed in,
09:25 - so instead of spending
hours procrastinating,
09:27 - which is what happens to me,
09:29 - when you get on these calls,
and when you get off the call,
09:31 - your brain is already going,
09:33 - and there's no room for procrastination.
09:35 - So this way that one or
two hours of that time
09:39 - is gonna be as effective,
when it comes to coding,
09:42 - as five to six hours of your time
09:45 - without having any
layer of accountability,
09:47 - any other person there would be.
09:50 - Because generally, it
takes two to three hours
09:52 - just to get your brain actually
spinning at that high speed
09:55 - where you can learn
very, very effectively.
09:58 - So please write, as you're
watching this video,
10:01 - if you want this video to actually
10:02 - have an impact on your life,
10:04 - and these are some of
the goals you aspire for,
10:07 - like being on your path to
becoming a six figure developer,
10:09 - getting a job where you're
respected and appreciated,
10:12 - being able to work from wherever you want,
10:14 - and most importantly, being
able to take the creative ideas
10:17 - from your head and
putting them into reality,
10:20 - then please, take notes on these
10:22 - so you can actually apply these,
10:24 - 'cause most of you are just gonna watch
10:25 - just for entertainment
purposes, which is cool,
10:28 - but only about half a percent or less
10:31 - are gonna actually take action on this
10:33 - and apply it in their life.
10:35 - I want you to be that half a percent
10:38 - and I want that half percent
to become the 90%, all right?
10:42 - So please don't just watch
this for your entertainment,
10:44 - watch this, actually take action.
10:46 - So write this down and in your mind,
10:48 - think about who that one
friend or person could be,
10:51 - where you can schedule that 30 minute call
10:53 - to add that extra layer of accountability.
10:55 - And also, before sleeping
tonight, or even right now,
10:59 - plan out your next day and exactly where
11:01 - you're gonna put in that one to two hours
11:03 - of coding block.
11:04 - Those are my thoughts on
discipline and structure.
11:07 - Now, other ways I'm using
discipline and structure
11:10 - in my life, I'm creating structure
11:14 - because I know I'm gonna run
out of motivation, I know that.
11:17 - So, other few things I've done are,
11:19 - health is important to me,
one of the things I wanna do
11:21 - is gain weight so I started
tracking my calories
11:24 - and I have to be hitting
over 2,600, 2,700 calories,
11:27 - so what I started doing is,
11:29 - I made a pact with one of my friends
11:31 - that if I don't send him that I hit over
11:33 - 2,700 calories every day, and
show him my food tracking,
11:37 - I don't send him a picture
by the end of the day,
11:39 - then I have to pay him $100.
11:42 - Every single time that happens.
11:44 - So, it's a win for him
to hold me accountable
11:47 - and it's a win for me,
because there's so much pain
11:50 - associated to not doing
it that I have to do it.
11:53 - Another cool idea I'll give you is,
11:55 - with two of my best friends,
11:56 - Tenzin, who's my best friend and he's also
11:59 - on the channel What's Dev,
12:01 - and another one of my best
friends, his name is Matthew,
12:04 - and he's starting his own
company for CAD Caliber,
12:07 - and what we do is we run a
mastermind call every week,
12:11 - where we just essentially
meet on online call,
12:13 - on a Zoom call, for one hour.
12:16 - And what we do is, we
have created a money pool,
12:19 - so everybody puts 500 bucks a month,
12:21 - and three months later, we
all give that money back
12:24 - to each other, we refund it.
12:26 - But only if you show up to every call.
12:28 - If anybody misses a
call, that person's money
12:31 - gets distributed equally
to the other two people.
12:33 - So for example, let's say
that you have two friends.
12:36 - If one of the friends doesn't show up,
12:39 - then that friend's $500, you get 250,
12:42 - and your other friend
who showed up gets 250.
12:45 - So, just some ideas to get
your brain worrying about
12:49 - how to create discipline and structure.
12:51 - It's super, super important
because it allows you
12:53 - to transcend feelings and emotions,
12:55 - because you never, one
day you're feeling good,
12:58 - one day you're not.
12:59 - So that is my advice on
how to use discipline
13:03 - and structure to get yourself to not only
13:08 - learn how to code but with
a very practical viewpoint
13:12 - of, okay, learning how to
code but keeping in mind
13:16 - that I wanna shortcut three
to five years into one year
13:20 - and I want to shortcut my
path to earning an income
13:24 - that is amazing, where I can
support myself and my family
13:28 - and everyone around me.
13:29 - So that's my point on
discipline and structure.
13:32 - The second thing that is gonna
be really valuable for you
13:37 - in terms of how to teach yourself to code,
13:39 - but also in terms of getting
a job or starting your company
13:44 - or getting freelancing clients
who you can build apps for.
13:48 - The second thing is soft skills.
13:50 - So to give you an amazing
example of soft skills,
13:54 - it looks like this.
13:56 - How long does it take for
somebody who, let's say,
13:58 - is making $60,000 a year to
work their way up to $75,000?
14:03 - For a lot of people, that
might take three to five years.
14:07 - That's oftentimes what
I have seen, if that.
14:09 - A lot of the time, I just
see people stuck at 60
14:11 - for 30 years.
14:12 - So let's say somebody works
from 60 to 75 in five years.
14:16 - But if you understand
how soft skills work,
14:20 - like in negotiation, and you're
able to withstand pressure
14:23 - and understand how these things just work,
14:26 - these are principles, like
law of gravity, right?
14:28 - So for example, every time somebody
14:30 - throws an offer at you, you
never accept the first one.
14:32 - And if somebody says yes to the first time
14:35 - you throw something out there,
it means that it was too low.
14:38 - Your price was too low.
14:39 - So what you wanna do
when it comes to this is,
14:41 - you never wanna be the first one,
14:43 - oftentimes in these situations,
14:45 - to throw the first price out.
14:46 - You want to ask them
where they would put it,
14:50 - so then you can have a counter-offer.
14:52 - So just to give you an example,
14:54 - you can spend five years
going from 60,000 to $75,000
14:58 - a year, or you can go from
60,000 to $75,000 by just
15:06 - spending 30 extra minutes
during your first interview
15:09 - and throwing a counter-offer
after the interview is over.
15:12 - And now, you're making
$75,000 a year, right?
15:16 - Why it's so important and
I talk so much about money,
15:19 - is that everybody, when
you talk about money,
15:21 - they're like, oh, money, money,
15:23 - they're talking about money.
15:25 - Okay, money is one of the most important
15:26 - points of your life.
15:28 - You work for money, otherwise
why, a lot of the times,
15:30 - yes, I understand that you
wanna build amazing things
15:33 - and you want to do things
that impact, right?
15:36 - Impact your life and every body else's.
15:38 - But money is a very
important point of it, right?
15:41 - That's why oftentimes, it's like,
15:43 - you wanna go on a
vacation but you're like,
15:44 - oh, I gotta work, I can't just leave.
15:46 - So money is a very important point.
15:48 - What I'm trying to say is
that money gives you freedom
15:51 - and it gives you the ability
to do what you want, right?
15:54 - So if you wanna take more vacations,
15:56 - or you wanna be more
creative in your life,
15:58 - it gives you the room to do that.
16:00 - So oftentimes, we are, a lot of times,
16:02 - working to get a higher income, right?
16:06 - So if somebody is stuck at $20 an hour,
16:09 - and they go to $60 an hour,
16:12 - effectively what has taken
place is what would have taken
16:16 - three lifetimes, they can
achieve in one lifetime.
16:19 - You haven't just tripled your salary,
16:21 - you've literally tripled
and cut the time in a third.
16:27 - What would have taken 30 years
now will just take 10 years.
16:31 - What would have taken three
years now will take one year
16:34 - for you to achieve in your life.
16:36 - This is why soft skills
and understanding them
16:38 - is very important, and it doesn't take up
16:40 - that much of your time,
but in terms of impact,
16:43 - there's a high level of impact.
16:47 - I hope I'm saying the name right,
16:49 - but I think it's called
the Pareto's Principle,
16:51 - the 80//20 Rule.
16:52 - Soft skill is definitely
a great 80/20 rule,
16:55 - where you spend only 20%
of your time learning,
16:58 - and 80% of your results
you'll actually get from this,
17:01 - when it comes to your career.
17:03 - When it comes to the
types of clients you want,
17:05 - the ones that make you happy,
17:06 - the type of dream job you want,
17:09 - it will oftentimes depend on these skills.
17:13 - So those are two points, and
I know that they're a lot.
17:15 - Just to recap real quick,
17:17 - discipline and structure
gives you freedom, number one,
17:20 - so add that to your life.
17:22 - Number two, soft skills
can really help you
17:24 - shortcut your path.
17:25 - And the last one I'm gonna
tell you is number three,
17:28 - is mentorship.
17:30 - So, if you get a mentor in your life,
17:33 - that is oftentimes a way
to choose right decisions
17:38 - instead of wrong decisions.
17:39 - It's like, if you had to go somewhere,
17:43 - you can try to just
figure it out on your own,
17:45 - you can keep driving your car
and through trial and error,
17:49 - get to where you wanna go.
17:51 - Or you can stop at different gas stations
17:53 - and ask for directions, hey,
La Brea's that way, right?
17:55 - You might figure it out at one point,
17:57 - or you can just follow Google Maps.
17:59 - You can just follow GPS
and a navigation system.
18:02 - Mentors oftentimes have seen the path
18:05 - that is gonna come ahead of you,
18:07 - so they tell you where to go.
18:09 - This way, you don't have to
figure it out on your own,
18:12 - make mistakes, fall off a cliff,
18:15 - and what other sayings are there?
18:17 - There's one with the arrow, right?
18:18 - Pioneers get shot with an
arrow, pioneers get scathed,
18:24 - I don't know, but it's basically,
18:26 - if you're the discoverer,
oftentimes you get screwed over
18:29 - more than it actually helps you.
18:31 - So you want somebody who's already kind of
18:33 - discovered the path and
then let them guide you
18:35 - to that path.
18:36 - So for example, they can tell you,
18:38 - hey, based on your skill
and your personality type,
18:41 - you should be in analytics,
18:43 - you should do data analytics in Python.
18:45 - Or you should become a data scientist.
18:48 - Or, you should become
a software developer,
18:51 - or you should become a game developer.
18:53 - And all of a sudden, this new whole thing
18:55 - opens up for you, and
now maybe you would have
18:58 - spent 10 years figuring it out,
18:59 - you found it out like this, all right?
19:02 - For example, one of my mentors was like,
19:04 - hey, literally, I was
charging one of my clients
19:06 - $50 an hour, and he's like,
why are you charging them 50?
19:09 - You should be charging them a hundred,
19:11 - because as a Python consultant,
19:13 - that's actually very cheap
to charge $100 an hour,
19:16 - and then I just went back to them,
19:17 - and I'm like, hey guys, I'm
actually gonna charge you
19:20 - $100 an hour, and they came back to me,
19:22 - and they were just like, they
agreed, okay, that's fine.
19:26 - That one moment helped me achieve more.
19:29 - It basically cut my time in half
19:32 - to the results I wanted to get,
19:34 - and helped me earn twice
the amount of income
19:36 - in that same year,
rather than in two years.
19:40 - So that's the power of mentorship,
19:43 - so the action step for you would be like,
19:45 - go to meetup.com and find
places where you can get,
19:50 - where you can just meet with people
19:52 - and maybe even get a mentor
if you have no money.
19:54 - But if you have some money,
19:56 - you should use it to go
on platforms like, maybe,
19:59 - codementor.io and get a mentor.
20:01 - Or just anywhere where you can
find somebody who's achieved,
20:05 - but please don't just
get a teacher, all right?
20:08 - Get somebody who has the results you want.
20:12 - If you want a job at Google, find a mentor
20:17 - who works at Google to mentor you.
20:20 - Reach out to them on LinkedIn.
20:22 - Ask them for a coffee, ask
them for a little interview.
20:25 - Ask them if you could speak to them
20:27 - over a cup of coffee for 10 minutes.
20:29 - Ask them if you could call them
20:30 - and ask them a few questions.
20:31 - If you wanna work at Facebook,
ask somebody from Facebook.
20:34 - If you want somebody who's
built apps with programming
20:39 - and has ran an agency, and
you wanna become somebody
20:41 - who has developers working under him,
20:43 - go to somebody who has done that.
20:45 - And ask them for advice and
ask them to be your mentor.
20:48 - Either pay them or figure out a way
20:51 - where they can be your mentors.
20:54 - Oftentimes it's very
possible, you might be like,
20:56 - oh, but why would they wanna work with me?
20:58 - Listen, right now, I'm personally focusing
21:00 - on growing my business so I
go this group called METal,
21:03 - it takes place in LA.
21:04 - It's for thought leaders
and entrepreneurs,
21:06 - and all these crazy, literally,
Elon Musks of the world
21:10 - go here, people who are billionaires
21:11 - and other people who are millionaires
21:14 - and then you have some broke
people like me sitting there,
21:17 - and they consider me a newbie there.
21:19 - So that's where I wanna be, right?
21:21 - And some other people, they're managing
21:24 - quarter billion dollar hedge funds,
21:27 - and one of those guys,
his name is William,
21:29 - and he's kinda like my mentor.
21:31 - And he gives me advice in life,
21:34 - how to actually grow my business,
21:35 - and what are some of the things
I should be thinking about
21:38 - like 10 years from now that
I haven't even thought about.
21:41 - Don't look for tutors, all right?
21:43 - Look for people who can actually
guide you in the long term
21:46 - on your path, understand your pain points
21:49 - and have achieved the
results that you want.
21:52 - This is a really deep video,
I hope that your brain
21:55 - is kind of pulsating
and I can almost imagine
21:58 - it hurting a little bit
if you've watched it
22:00 - until this point.
22:01 - Which is good, because
it means you're learning
22:03 - new things and you're
gonna try out these ideas.
22:06 - So I'm really excited for you to be here.
22:07 - To recap real quick,
discipline and structure
22:10 - gives you freedom, puts you on your path
22:13 - to becoming a six figure developer
22:14 - or a creative entrepreneur,
22:17 - or getting the dream nine
to five job that you want.
22:20 - Number two, soft skills
literally can help you
22:24 - shortcut your path from
five years to one year.
22:27 - And mentorship can help
you shortcut that path
22:31 - even more on steroids, but
more than shortcut your path,
22:34 - it can show you things and opportunities
22:36 - you never even thought existed before,
22:40 - and create a whole new
kind of value for you.
22:43 - So, complete game changer.
22:45 - See where you can apply those things,
22:47 - commit to taking those action steps
22:49 - and hopefully this has been
really, really valuable for you.
22:53 - Now, this video has come to an end,
22:56 - but here is what I have for you.

what is your number one
23:05 - biggest challenge when it comes
to your programming career?

or it could be about
23:12 - growing as a developer,
negotiating, getting a promotion,
23:16 - getting a new job or getting
more clients as a freelancer.
