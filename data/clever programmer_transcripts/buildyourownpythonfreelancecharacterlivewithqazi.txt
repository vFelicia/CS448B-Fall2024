00:12 - programmer calm we are live on Instagram
00:15 - YouTube Facebook this video we're gonna
00:19 - be covering a little bit more technical
00:21 - stuff related to Python okay so if you
00:24 - have been like hmm when does Kazi gonna
00:27 - teach us some more technical stuff don't
00:30 - worry today we're gonna talk a little
00:32 - bit about more technical things along
00:34 - with the soft skills that are needed
00:37 - okay some of the things that we're gonna
00:39 - be talking about is what is the best web
00:41 - development framework for Python okay
00:45 - what do those frameworks the developers
00:49 - who develop in those frameworks what did
00:51 - they get paid on average and we're gonna
00:55 - be talking about the best code editor
00:58 - for Python alrighty and I'm also gonna
01:04 - be looking at your guys's comments and
01:06 - checking them out do you for them yeah
01:12 - buddy

03:07 - they can't even hear me and in this
03:12 - video we're also gonna be talking about
03:13 - how you can build your own Python
03:17 - freelance character and take your own
03:20 - skills up as a Python freelancer okay if
03:22 - you want to be a Python developer and
03:24 - work with a company or be a site hustler
03:26 - you're also welcome here I'm just gonna
03:28 - be focusing more on this freelancing
03:30 - part and I'm gonna be kind of talking
03:33 - more about that as well Larry says thank
03:37 - you so much love the portfolio guys the
03:39 - second video is out make sure in the
03:43 - description it lets them maybe know that
03:45 - a little bit but guys the second video
03:47 - the part two of the master class is live
03:51 - okay this master class is what shows you
03:54 - how you can become a Python developer in
03:57 - less than 90 days and get that first
04:00 - paycheck this master class is absolutely
04:03 - free and in the first master class we
04:07 - covered a lot of things like soft skills
04:09 - we covered just overall lots of things
04:13 - like for example your Python earning
04:15 - potential how much you could be looking
04:18 - to make okay so if you haven't watched
04:22 - the
04:22 - first one go watch it it's absolutely
04:25 - free and it's in the links in the
04:26 - descriptions below so go enjoy that and
04:30 - I have some other stuff for you guys let
04:32 - me just pull up some of my notes coolly
04:37 - okay make this half on this screen but a
04:42 - BAM bada boom well what did I press
04:47 - being a programmer and all I should
04:50 - really learn how to use my computer this
04:56 - goes here and this goes here and we are
04:59 - golden okay for people who are having
05:05 - trouble opening up the portfolio guys
05:10 - it's just like like literally you know I
05:13 - made it so you can double-click and open
05:15 - it or you can just go on and open a new
05:17 - file in Chrome if you're still having
05:18 - trouble google how to open an HTML file
05:23 - that's it just Google how to open an
05:26 - index.html file
05:28 - and Google will give you all your
05:29 - answers okay because in the second video
05:32 - we go over all of that okay so in the
05:36 - second video that got launched today I
05:38 - show you the number one secret to how
05:40 - you can become that developer in less
05:41 - than 90 days okay this is if you don't
05:43 - have degree you don't have money you
05:45 - don't have time and you don't have
05:47 - technical skills it works for all of you
05:49 - guys I also go over how I went from
05:52 - being a 2.0 GPA student and making
05:56 - $100,000 in one year and I kind of give
05:58 - you guys that as well
06:00 - okay so I give you how I did that while
06:04 - being a bad student so some of you guys
06:07 - can relate with that and it would help
06:09 - you knowing that you don't need to be
06:10 - smart enough and see that practical path
06:12 - that's also in there yeah we're gonna do
06:17 - the Q&A for a little bit but yet so the
06:19 - where this live stream where the idea
06:21 - kind of got conceptualized in my mind
06:23 - for this live stream which is I say
06:26 - build your Python freelance character is
06:29 - I remember when I was younger and I
06:31 - would play video games like Sims or like
06:35 - Skyrim
06:36 - or I used to play this one game called
06:37 - Dragon Age Origins and what what a lot
06:42 - of these games have in common is you
06:44 - have a character and whatever you do
06:48 - with this character you get these skill
06:49 - points and your guy becomes better and
06:51 - better in those particular skills so for
06:55 - example if you're playing a game like
06:56 - Dragon Age Origins and your guy is
06:59 - focusing on being a mage and he's doing
07:02 - spells or whatever or if your guy is
07:04 - being an archer or a swordsman whatever
07:07 - as you spend more time with those
07:10 - weapons or those things your guy levels
07:13 - up in those skills or take Sims where
07:16 - when your guy spends more time reading
07:18 - books he becomes better at reading more
07:21 - books and also he becomes more
07:23 - knowledgeable so now he can make new
07:25 - foods that he couldn't make before and
07:27 - he can do a lot of things he couldn't do
07:29 - before or for if he spends more time in
07:32 - the gym
07:32 - your characters get those skill points
07:35 - in the gym he starts getting better and
07:36 - then it takes him longer to get hungry
07:38 - and all that and there was a point in my
07:43 - life where I kind of loved games and
07:45 - then what happened to me was I kind of
07:49 - realized that if you spend time on
07:55 - yourself and you build up those skill
08:00 - points just in life it's kind of the
08:04 - same way even though there's no gamma
08:08 - fication happening you know you're the
08:11 - gooey bars are actually not building up
08:12 - and you can't go somewhere you don't get
08:14 - a notification for it right and when you
08:17 - log into life when you wake up you don't
08:19 - get a little notification that goes Boop
08:21 - you got a hundred points for sleeping on
08:24 - time and getting seven and a half hours
08:25 - of sleep you don't get a little
08:27 - notification for going to the gym today
08:29 - you don't get a little notification for
08:31 - being nice to your parents you don't get
08:33 - a notification for it getting your
08:35 - girlfriend a little gift and what starts
08:38 - to happen is when we don't have that
08:41 - instant gratification we look in other
08:43 - places those other places could be video
08:46 - games those other places could be things
08:48 - like drugs and alcohol
08:49 - and those other places could just be you
08:52 - know whatever like places where you're
08:55 - fine like Netflix you're watching
08:58 - stranger things
08:58 - you're watching house of cards you're
09:00 - binging on some anime you just found and
09:04 - that happens to us a lot and that
09:07 - happens to me at times too and as you
09:11 - compare what you're doing in those video
09:13 - games and in those movies and how the
09:16 - drugs and alcohol might make you feel
09:19 - with where you actually are in real life
09:23 - the contrast it kind of it hurts because
09:27 - one thing is so awesome and fun and
09:29 - instant gratification whereas this other
09:32 - thing you're getting farther and farther
09:34 - from your goals every day you're just
09:35 - sitting there like if I just started
09:38 - going to the gym I had that thought like
09:41 - seven years ago and I thought I was too
09:44 - old to go to the gym seven years ago and
09:45 - if I just done it what would I look like
09:48 - right now or you have that thought oh
09:51 - man I knew I could have done that job or
09:53 - started that business and now my friends
09:56 - doing it and look how well he's doing or
09:58 - I should have started a YouTube channel
09:59 - and look where that would have been now
10:01 - or I should have done this for that and
10:03 - look where that would have been now but
10:06 - then BOOM switch let's watch some
10:08 - stranger things baby let's watch some
10:10 - house of cards let's watch some Fargo
10:12 - forget about everything else and we kind
10:18 - of get caught up in that but here's a
10:22 - cool thing if you can if you can get
10:24 - over that instant gratification thing a
10:27 - little bit and not getting those little
10:29 - notifications in life and you start to
10:31 - really focus every day you take 10 to 15
10:34 - minutes analyzing where you are your own
10:37 - life is kind of like being that video
10:41 - game character if you spend more time
10:45 - dealing with tough tough conversations
10:48 - maybe you're at work at whatever your
10:50 - current job is and you go in to ask for
10:52 - that promotion it feels uncomfortable
10:53 - your how it hearts pounding your hands
10:55 - are shaking you're sweating whoo scary
11:00 - right but when you go and do it
11:03 - and you get through it and maybe you get
11:05 - that promotion what just happened
11:08 - your skill points improved in
11:10 - negotiation and now you could use those
11:13 - skill points at other jobs isn't it
11:17 - freaking cool like after you kind of
11:20 - realize that why do you need to play
11:21 - Skyrim you kind of don't what happens
11:24 - when you put some time into going to the
11:26 - gym after a little bit weeks you know a
11:29 - few weeks you'll start to see some
11:31 - results and now you're putting points
11:33 - into your own physical fitness and
11:35 - getting better your character in real
11:37 - life is getting better and guess what
11:40 - when you put that controller away the
11:45 - character doesn't go away it's still
11:46 - there with you forever if the lights go
11:50 - out and the game ends or the hard drive
11:53 - crashes and all your saves are gone it
11:56 - doesn't matter because that character is
11:58 - you and that's there forever
11:59 - that doesn't run out of batteries if you
12:05 - spend time coding like Python for
12:08 - example or whatever language and you're
12:10 - coding you're building your coding
12:12 - skills tree you're becoming a better
12:14 - developer and if you spend time doing
12:18 - this and you're building cool projects
12:19 - it literally feels just like playing a
12:21 - game except you might be making six
12:25 - figures doing it isn't that nice now
12:29 - contrast that with playing video games
12:31 - watching stranger things abusing drugs
12:34 - and alcohol and sitting in your mom's
12:36 - basement versus playing this other game
12:40 - called being a developer web development
12:44 - working on projects I feel literally
12:46 - like a game except it's like a glitch in
12:48 - life and people are paying you money
12:50 - money for it and at the end of the day
12:53 - you have something to show for it and
12:55 - you're doing this from a nice apartment
12:57 - overlooking a lake or something I don't
13:00 - know whatever it is that you like to
13:01 - overlook maybe you could be overlooking
13:03 - dumpsters that's your thing I don't know
13:04 - I don't know that is something that
13:08 - excites me these skills if you work on
13:11 - them on your own in real life when
13:13 - everything else goes to these
13:15 - skills are there with you
13:17 - forever they're there with you to stay
13:20 - there with you and you're getting money
13:22 - as a benefit as a bonus and now you can
13:27 - not only support yourself but your
13:29 - family you also don't have to feel like
13:32 - you're you don't have confidence you
13:34 - also don't have to feel like you have
13:36 - that lack of control in life because
13:40 - doing these things and working on
13:42 - yourself gives you that control in life
13:45 - okay so this is something important to
13:49 - keep in mind as you move forward now
13:55 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna talk
13:58 - a little bit about web development and
14:02 - the differences between different
14:05 - frameworks okay so we're gonna get a
14:07 - little bit technical and we're going to
14:08 - talk about Python again in the meantime
14:11 - I'm going to look at some of your guys's
14:13 - what you guys are saying maybe some
14:15 - comments maybe some questions and kind
14:17 - of answer that
14:45 - no questions so far not too many
14:48 - questions I am looking for some
14:51 - questions that I can ask for you guys or
14:53 - answer for you guys can you make neural
14:55 - network tutorial for beginners using
14:57 - Python yes I will be making I will be
15:00 - doing some stuff with machine learning
15:01 - later on not at this moment in time
15:05 - because I'm focusing more on web
15:07 - development with Python but don't worry
15:09 - this is something that excites the hell
15:11 - out of me so I will be doing some neural
15:13 - network stuff and I'm gonna be bringing
15:15 - on best developers in the world on this
15:18 - channel and they're either gonna be
15:21 - helping me build some kind of awesome
15:24 - curriculum for you guys or literally I'm
15:26 - gonna have them make some videos for you
15:27 - guys too so AI or whatever it is that
15:31 - you guys want to learn not a problem
15:37 - here's what I urge everybody to do right
15:40 - now I'm gonna give you like 20 seconds
15:44 - as I go through these q and A's have a
15:47 - pen paper with you because the things
15:50 - that we're gonna be talking about are
15:51 - extremely valuable you don't want to
15:55 - miss them
15:55 - okay I would share the slides with you
15:58 - but again I'm on three different live
16:00 - platforms so I have to respect that
16:02 - because if I share the slides with
16:04 - everybody on YouTube
16:05 - if Instagram doesn't see that and if I
16:07 - share something on Facebook YouTube and
16:09 - Instagram doesn't see that so I have to
16:10 - respect all that so guys go get a piece
16:13 - of paper pen whatever and write these
16:17 - things down because they're gonna be
16:18 - very valuable to you as time Prague
16:20 - makes progress
16:37 - okay so there are two big frameworks in
16:40 - Python but before we talk about
16:41 - framework let's talk about web
16:44 - development in general okay
16:49 - web development has to do with
16:52 - developing things on the web everything
16:54 - you see online and the main one of the
16:57 - main things I want to kind of touch on
16:59 - is web sites versus web apps okay or
17:03 - basically like solutions to problems so
17:07 - regular web sites I want you to think of
17:09 - like imagine I don't know your regular
17:13 - contact me pages your restaurant web
17:16 - sites that are super boring and just I
17:19 - don't know have like static stuff on it
17:22 - you can't really do much there just go
17:23 - just read their menu that's really yet
17:25 - or it maybe has some dudes phone number
17:27 - and you can call them or email somebody
17:29 - that's your static website but those
17:34 - things you can build in WordPress or
17:39 - Squarespace if you guys are not familiar
17:41 - with these open another tab and type
17:44 - this in so you can learn or write these
17:46 - down so you can learn them later you
17:49 - actually don't open and there are other
17:50 - tabs right now I want you guys to pay
17:52 - attention right here to me and just
17:56 - write this down and then later you can
17:57 - open up other tabs and do this okay so
18:00 - WordPress is basically like a
18:02 - point-and-click build a website
18:03 - Squarespace is a point-and-click build a
18:06 - website thing wakes and Weebly similarly
18:08 - those things people don't pay you a lot
18:12 - for those are commodities you can have
18:15 - 12 year old learn it very quickly and
18:20 - and also a lot of those are outsourced
18:23 - and there are a lot of people that can
18:25 - do them ok so any skill that's easy to
18:27 - do you're not gonna get paid for ok but
18:30 - a skill that takes a lot of time and is
18:34 - difficult you're gonna get paid for it
18:36 - and quite a bit because it's hard to
18:40 - replace you like right now and think
18:42 - about this where you are working
18:46 - how easy do you think it is to replace
18:49 - you if the answer is pretty easy then it
18:53 - probably also makes sense what you're
18:55 - getting paid right so if you think
18:59 - you're getting paid some low income and
19:02 - then you think that it's not that hard
19:04 - to replace you put the two and two
19:07 - together and the reason why you're
19:09 - probably making a lower income is cuz
19:11 - that it's easier to replace you
19:13 - but now as you start to get more
19:16 - specialized and as you learn more skills
19:18 - it's harder to replace you okay so
19:20 - generic websites that you can build with
19:23 - web web wordpress or whatever they're
19:26 - not too hard to do so you don't get paid
19:30 - much for it but the things that you do
19:31 - get paid for is for example and I'm
19:35 - gonna use big company name so it you
19:37 - guys can tie that in your head but most
19:40 - of the times when you're starting out
19:41 - you don't have to work with these big
19:43 - companies you can get started with a lot
19:45 - smaller companies that are under the
19:46 - radar and are trying to get their foot
19:49 - off the ground and get going but with
19:52 - the things that you get paid for is for
19:53 - example like Spotify is a music
19:55 - streaming problem and if you can solve
19:58 - it that's something you can get paid for
20:01 - so that's like a web app how about
20:03 - Domino's right where you can go and it'd
20:08 - be really boring if the pizza is just
20:11 - pictures of them were there and you just
20:13 - had to call them and order something but
20:15 - it's pretty dynamic you have to click on
20:18 - it you can order you can increase your
20:20 - order you can change your order when
20:21 - when you're in their app when you put
20:23 - mushrooms on your pizza
20:24 - you can choose if you want to put half
20:26 - on one side and half on the other you
20:29 - can choose what's your quantity you can
20:31 - delete and you can remove so for all of
20:35 - those things and being able to add that
20:37 - functionality that's a solution to a
20:43 - burning problem and the developers that
20:46 - got hard hire to do that would get paid
20:48 - a lot same thing with snapchat there's a
20:51 - huge networking problem there to fix how
20:54 - do you have all these people in the
20:55 - world sending each other pictures it
20:58 - goes fast it doesn't crash and
21:00 - our website and they're able to send
21:02 - pictures and videos like instantly boom
21:04 - boom boom how do you do that
21:06 - without your servers being overloaded
21:10 - right and here's a word I'm gonna give
21:15 - you guys it's called crud so write that
21:18 - down
21:19 - that's one of the things you have to
21:20 - know about as a web developer and be
21:22 - able to do pretty fast
21:25 - crud c ru D in caps so if you guys are
21:35 - here write that in comments and also
21:40 - write that you call caps crud and then
21:45 - I'm gonna tell you guys what it stands
21:47 - for - okay so write that down on your
21:50 - notes and once you guys write this down
21:52 - on your notes or your hands I don't
21:54 - really care write this down
21:57 - then let me know say something like
21:59 - three I don't know three yeah number
22:02 - three just say three once you write it
22:03 - down it'd be better if I just add them
22:07 - say crud
22:18 - cool
22:19 - crud means read it means create just
22:29 - making sure you guys are paying
22:30 - attention it means create read update
22:32 - and delete okay for things I don't know
22:38 - why I do it like I'm in Germany in
22:41 - United States we do it like this for but
22:44 - I think it's just cooler when I do when
22:46 - I do three like this I think it's really
22:47 - cool so I'm gonna keep doing it but
22:50 - that's what that means okay
22:51 - crud create read update delete write
22:54 - that down next to you on a piece of
22:57 - paper preferably and what that has to do
23:01 - with is I'll give I'll give you examples
23:03 - of where it's applied when you're when
23:06 - you're in Domino's app and you're trying
23:08 - to create an order for those of you guys
23:10 - who don't know dominoes dominoes is a
23:12 - company that delivers pizzas this off
23:14 - the pizza problem okay when you create a
23:19 - order for a pizza that's what part of
23:23 - the crud I'm now gonna quiz you guys as
23:26 - you guys watch this live stream when you
23:31 - create the pizza
23:32 - what part of crud do you think that is
23:37 - is it the see is that the or is it the U
23:42 - or the D what mines are taking them so
23:50 - long
23:50 - okay good Eric cool thank you for being
23:53 - the cool one yes good a gamer's pro tube
23:59 - he says who doesn't know Domino's you'd
24:01 - be surprised because for one you
24:03 - misspelled Domino's my friend I think
24:06 - you're talking about the Domino's game
24:08 - Domino's Pizza spelled differently
24:12 - legendary nerd laughs some people say I
24:17 - want to ate now roasted live on clever
24:21 - programmer calm that's what happens to
24:24 - being tried to roast other people get
24:25 - your get your own game in check or
24:27 - anyway sorry got off tangent okay
24:30 - that's the create part now what about
24:32 - being able to let's say you put that
24:35 - order but now you want to change that
24:37 - order okay now you want to make that
24:40 - order something different what part of
24:42 - the crud do you think that is when
24:45 - you've already created the order but now
24:47 - before hitting checkout you're like I
24:50 - don't want pepperonis on my pizza
24:52 - I just want some green peppers and
24:53 - jalapenos what part of crud is that good
25:15 - that's the update part all right and
25:19 - before I go further for those of you
25:21 - guys are like what are we doing web
25:25 - developers get paid a hundred and ten
25:28 - thousand dollars a year and believe it
25:30 - or not this is one of the things that is
25:32 - massively helpful and right now I know
25:35 - I'm having you just like kind of learn
25:36 - it and regurgitate and memorizing it was
25:38 - like oh it doesn't make sense but I
25:39 - promise you right after we're done with
25:42 - this I'm gonna kind of give you examples
25:44 - I'm gonna be giving examples of it and
25:46 - this is this is gonna be one of those
25:47 - things that saves you years of your time
25:49 - and also helps you
25:51 - now it's researchable for you so you can
25:54 - actually look at online tutorials be
25:56 - able to do this and get those jobs that
25:58 - pay you a lot and you don't need years
26:02 - of experience to get these web
26:03 - development jobs like in my PLC - or my
26:07 - video - part two of the master class
26:10 - okay that got launched it's called why
26:12 - most programmers are broke in that one I
26:16 - also share with you what things I was
26:19 - working on and what client paid me
26:21 - twenty thousand one hundred and seventy
26:23 - three dollars and thirty cents for two
26:25 - months of work and it was pretty much
26:28 - just me knowing crud and working on it
26:29 - so now let's continue forward so you
26:33 - guys know you guys have it in your mind
26:36 - why this can be actually really
26:37 - important helpful for you all right now
26:40 - when I am let's say
26:43 - let's just do last one and this is so
26:46 - obvious if I don't want my pizza anymore
26:48 - I'm just angry I don't like I just call
26:50 - Domino's service and that lady just
26:54 - didn't have the right attitude she just
26:56 - pissed me off rubbed me the wrong way
26:57 - and I'm like all right all bets are off
26:59 - and I go and I hit X on that order what
27:03 - part of the crud did I just do yeah oh
27:20 - god damn it was closed sweet good job
27:31 - you guys know your stuff patty
27:35 - that's hilarious patty poo says I do
27:37 - that all the time
27:38 - delete nice that's one of my friends too
27:42 - he always made YouTube videos of guitar
27:43 - and he deleted them and he would have
27:46 - had millions of views but instead he has
27:47 - zero views on his guitar channel yep
27:50 - good job guys it's the delete part so if
27:54 - I delete my order I've deleted so again
27:56 - crud create read update and delete okay
28:00 - and lastly I want to give you an example
28:03 - of the read part what if you have
28:06 - ordered your pizza but you don't know
28:09 - what the heck you ordered and then you
28:11 - go click view order what part of crud is
28:15 - that create read update delete what part
28:19 - of the crud is that you being able to go
28:21 - oh what the heck where what what pizza
28:23 - did i order you know clicking that view
28:25 - button
28:39 - boom
28:40 - man you guys are legends some people say
28:47 - we're lost it's okay if you're lost you
28:50 - just have to probably watch the stream a
28:53 - little bit back but just to keep you
28:55 - up-to-date if you're new right if you
28:57 - just enter the stream right now we're
29:01 - talking about web development and how in
29:02 - web development there's something very
29:05 - big concept called crud and Sanford
29:07 - create read update and delete and now
29:10 - I'm giving examples of Domino's a big
29:13 - company like Domino's uses crud a
29:15 - company like Spotify users crud for
29:17 - example if I want to add a music to the
29:20 - playlist
29:21 - maybe that creates a new music in my
29:23 - playlist so that's create if I click on
29:26 - it that gives me goes into it that's
29:28 - read and if I want to maybe shuffle it I
29:31 - don't know that's like updating it and
29:33 - if I want to remove it from my playlist
29:34 - that's delete okay
29:36 - same way with Netflix same way with
29:39 - YouTube every all of these apps can be
29:42 - pretty much summed up with one word if
29:45 - you want to call it crud okay that's
29:48 - what we're talking about and right now
29:49 - we're just quizzing everybody live on
29:51 - crud and making them understand the
29:54 - concept of this looking at comments just
30:05 - whoa nice okay awesome Tomo is now the
30:15 - moderator of the chat because he bribed
30:18 - us first with some with some super chats
30:21 - no not just kidding he he's doing a good
30:24 - job with the chat wow that's really cool
30:26 - I didn't even know you can make
30:27 - moderators well welcome Domo
30:34 - yeah so crud is love okay so for again
30:39 - for those you guys are new write these
30:41 - things down best development frameworks
30:44 - in Python
30:45 - there's Django and then there's flask
30:48 - write that down I'm gonna come back to
30:50 - that point okay what we're talking about
30:55 - is the big picture view of web
30:57 - development we're talking about how much
30:59 - Python web developers get paid so
31:01 - according to indeed.com if you look at
31:04 - it right now
31:06 - average Django Python developer makes a
31:11 - hundred and ten thousand and six hundred
31:13 - and ten dollars every single year and
31:21 - one of the key concepts their entire job
31:25 - could be summarized in is with one word
31:28 - crud okay so say it with me what the
31:31 - crud I get paid one hundred and ten
31:34 - thousand dollars a year for crud what
31:37 - the crud it's crazy so if you've written
31:42 - down crud if you've written down Django
31:45 - if you've written out flasks all these
31:47 - things you guys can research later also
31:49 - Python web developers and how much they
31:52 - make you could research later we've
31:57 - talked about WordPress and Squarespace
31:59 - being able to build boring sites but
32:03 - Python can help you build web apps okay
32:07 - that can provide solutions these are not
32:10 - things that you can just do in
32:11 - Squarespace and you know point-and-click
32:13 - these are things that you have to use
32:15 - real powerful programming languages for
32:18 - to solve problems things problems with
32:21 - things like Dropbox cloud storage
32:23 - problem solved with Python YouTube video
32:27 - sharing problem solved with Python I've
32:33 - already talked about Spotify reddit a
32:36 - social network for sharing links and
32:38 - threads and I don't even know it's very
32:41 - complicated for me a reddit was a social
32:44 - problem solved with Python
32:47 - Instagram similarly a photo sharing
32:50 - problem solved with Python so you can
32:54 - see that these massive companies are
32:56 - using it Google a search engine problem
32:58 - solved with Python okay so you have to
33:01 - build really custom solutions for it and
33:03 - ultimately again it comes down to crud
33:06 - alright it comes down to kind of one
33:08 - thing and crud is all over in games as
33:13 - well when you're playing video games
33:14 - okay when your character creates a new
33:16 - weapon then being able to see that
33:19 - weapon you click view weapon if you want
33:22 - to then add a little bit of firepower to
33:24 - that weapon so it increases its damage
33:26 - that's what you know be thinking about
33:29 - it so as I ask you just quickly in your
33:31 - mind just be active don't just sit there
33:33 - passively watching it just breathing
33:34 - because if you're just breathing and
33:36 - watching why even beyond the stream
33:39 - you're not getting anything out of it
33:41 - okay so I want to respect you and your
33:43 - time so that's why I tell you to
33:44 - actively learn and as I ask you
33:47 - questions just be quick and be right
33:49 - there have your pen and paper and just
33:50 - write down answers to everything I'm
33:52 - saying kind of like I'm right there with
33:54 - you okay alright what did I just say
33:57 - do you remember I lost my train of
33:59 - thought I got it games right okay so
34:06 - when you add magic to your weapon that's
34:09 - the update part all right and then when
34:12 - you maybe don't want that weapon anymore
34:13 - you don't want that shield anymore you
34:15 - that's the delete part so keep thinking
34:19 - about crud as you're going through life
34:21 - and be looking at things like that
34:23 - because that's another thing that can be
34:27 - helping you build that can be helping
34:31 - you build your own Python freelance
34:33 - character okay you're building the skill
34:35 - points so maybe in your skill tree you
34:37 - have Jango and as you put more time into
34:40 - Jango and build that skill tree right
34:44 - then maybe you learn about things like
34:46 - crud along that Jango tree or that flask
34:51 - tree and you become more and more
34:53 - valuable getting yourself closer to
34:56 - being able to land those jobs that pay
34:57 - you a hundred and ten thousand dollars a
34:59 - year
35:00 - oh look at this proof I went to you told
35:15 - me to show this right proof I went to
35:18 - Oakland Community College look at this
35:21 - it's showing correctly here oh look how
35:27 - a mustache my pen so if you guys are
35:39 - enjoying this so far give me a hell yeah
35:43 - before I continue because if you guys
35:48 - are not super chatting me and paying me
35:49 - money on YouTube
35:51 - you guys got to give me something so I
35:52 - continue
36:15 - let's keep this right here and I just
36:20 - monster has to sponsor me at some point
36:22 - and pay me for this yeah okay good good
36:27 - good good
36:33 - this is awesome man I love these guys
36:35 - could be here like I wish that we could
36:38 - just be in like the seminar place and
36:39 - then I could just like help everybody
36:41 - I'd just be running around be like boom
36:43 - boom boom boom boom and helping you guys
36:44 - build your things Hudson says I love
36:51 - your face no Hudson I love your face
36:53 - more my friend okay so if you sounds
37:02 - like you guys are loving this I want to
37:05 - pause for a moment before I continue
37:07 - again a lot of these things I go into
37:10 - deep in my profitable programmer
37:13 - masterclass which I just launched this
37:16 - class is absolutely free okay free2go
37:27 - and part two is called why the best
37:30 - programmers are broke and then part two
37:33 - again I show you how you can become a
37:36 - Python developer in less than 30 days if
37:38 - you have no time no money no degree and
37:41 - you feel like you're old or whatever and
37:44 - I'm just saying these things so people
37:47 - who jump into the livestream now they
37:49 - know where to go and what to do okay in
37:51 - this part 2 training series you know
37:54 - training video in my profitable
37:57 - programmer training I also go over how I
38:01 - made one hundred and four thousand
38:03 - dollars as a Oakton Community College
38:04 - student and apparently I have this pen
38:06 - too which is cool cuz just proof for you
38:10 - guys mmm not that I know you guys
38:14 - believe me but just want to throw it in
38:16 - there for those of you guys for luck
38:18 - and I go through that and I also show
38:22 - you guys literally
38:23 - my behind-the-scenes code some of it
38:25 - that I used to build this Python app
38:27 - okay for that client who paid me $20,000
38:30 - for two months of work less than two
38:32 - months of work and I got that client in
38:35 - 90 days of me going from zero coding
38:38 - skills knowing nothing about coding
38:41 - knowing not a single line of code to
38:44 - then landing this client in 90 days and
38:46 - then making 20k with this client and
38:49 - then going on to make 100k that one year
38:53 - okay that was my first year I started to
38:55 - code and that was my year yeah I was
38:58 - doing Python freelancing so if that's
39:01 - something that interests you right now
39:03 - pause what you're doing open a new tab
39:05 - click the link below
39:07 - it's called clever programmer 2 slash
39:10 - master class followed by whatever and
39:13 - it'll take you right to the master class
39:15 - so you can sign in sign up for it and
39:17 - then as the three videos that are
39:19 - supposed to get launched they're gonna
39:21 - get sent right to you also in the second
39:24 - video also in this second video I'm
39:29 - gonna be giving you your portfolio as a
39:31 - for a Python freelancer it's built
39:35 - specially for Python freelancers that
39:37 - you can literally download okay and
39:39 - steal from me and then what you can do
39:43 - is it has a my work section so as you
39:44 - continue your journey as a Python
39:46 - freelancer you can plug and chug your
39:49 - Python projects in this portfolio so I'm
39:52 - gonna be just giving away a full on
39:54 - portfolio again by itself this would be
39:58 - like a hundred or two hundred dollar
39:59 - course but I'm giving that portfolio
40:02 - away to you guys for free I'm also
40:04 - sharing the behind-the-scenes code for
40:07 - those of you guys who have missed part
40:09 - one of the training big mistake but it's
40:12 - still up all of these training videos
40:15 - are up for a limited time until I take
40:17 - them down but in part one we cover a lot
40:21 - of things a lot of things what do we
40:23 - cover
40:35 - so in part one like my friend said we
40:39 - show you your Python earning potential
40:41 - and we have put together a calculator
40:45 - for you that can show you what your
40:46 - earning potential for as a Python
40:48 - freelancer would be like okay so for
40:50 - example say that you got one client at
40:53 - $50 an hour you work with that client
40:55 - for ten hours and write this math down
40:58 - to because I'm gonna go through it fast
40:59 - because I've went through it in my last
41:01 - live stream but you again I'm gonna
41:03 - start again fifty dollars an hour you
41:07 - work with this client for ten hours a
41:09 - week and that's one of the lowest rate
41:11 - you can charge the Python freelancer
41:14 - week one you make five hundred dollars
41:17 - and in monthly you make two thousand
41:20 - dollars and yearly from that one client
41:22 - you make twenty four thousand dollars
41:24 - two thousand dollars pays for all this
41:26 - extra stuff phone bills Netflix Hulu
41:28 - whatever office rental stuff car
41:33 - insurance dental insurance I don't know
41:36 - whatever and the twenty four thousand
41:38 - dollars you could be using to start a
41:41 - new startup or put in 401k or Charles
41:43 - Schwab or make that investment you've
41:45 - always wanted to make extra income does
41:47 - not hurt and I help you calculate your
41:50 - Python earning potential by giving you
41:52 - the calculator you could literally steal
41:54 - and download and then also I have a
41:56 - worksheet for you that helps you figure
41:58 - out your Python freelancer lifestyle
42:00 - again all of that is for free
42:03 - unbelievable I can't even believe I give
42:05 - you guys all the stuff for free so just
42:07 - go and take advantage of it all right
42:09 - please would you do that for me if
42:11 - you're here go ahead and do that link is
42:14 - in the description on Facebook the link
42:18 - is in bio on Instagram and link is in
42:21 - description on YouTube now with that
42:25 - shameless plug being out of the way
42:27 - let's continue moving forward
42:39 - okay Sheldon here's what I want you to
42:44 - do on YouTube I see you say when I load
42:47 - the profitable programmer portfolio I
42:49 - only get plain HTML I want you to email
42:54 - us I'm not gonna announce what the email
42:57 - is because then this YouTube video gets
42:59 - launched in the sly stream gets washed
43:01 - and everybody just emails us at once go
43:03 - to my website clever programmer calm at
43:05 - the bottom hit continue to website and
43:08 - then go to the contact page get our
43:11 - email from there and then send me an
43:14 - email and I'll personally get on a call
43:15 - with you and I'll help you figure out
43:17 - how to put that portfolio together for
43:19 - yourself Sheldon okay also for those
43:23 - other people that might be going through
43:25 - the same problem don't take the
43:28 - index.html file out of the folder
43:31 - everybody this is for the people who
43:33 - went through part two of my training
43:35 - which is called why most programmers are
43:37 - broke and in there I let you download a
43:40 - portfolio app that's built specially for
43:43 - Python freelancers and when you open
43:46 - them that portfolio you literally have
43:48 - it you've just stolen it from me like
43:49 - this and I have video instructions on
43:51 - how to copy it but if you take out that
43:54 - index.html file that I gave you in the
43:55 - folder and put it somewhere else and
43:57 - then double click and open it it'll kind
44:00 - of give you wrong stuff meaning it'll
44:02 - give you only a plain HTML file without
44:04 - CSS there meaning the styling so think
44:08 - of it like a human without clothes hTML
44:11 - is like a person without clothes was
44:13 - just naked and then the CSS part the
44:16 - cascading style sheet is what gives you
44:18 - that style puts on that clothing and
44:20 - makes you look good okay so you're still
44:24 - a person meaning your website still
44:25 - exists with HTML you still have links
44:28 - and you have you know words on it
44:31 - but it looks really boring and it
44:33 - doesn't look interesting and it just
44:35 - creeps people out but then when you ask
44:38 - CSS to it then it makes people feel
44:40 - comfortable and actually enjoy spending
44:44 - time on that website okay
44:48 - man we are making some dough for making
44:53 - some money on YouTube man all right
44:58 - monkey says how much money doesn't
45:00 - create apps course cost monkey two three
45:05 - one six again I want you to go to my
45:07 - website hit continue to website go to
45:09 - contact email us it's email us and I
45:13 - will tell you exactly how much the
45:16 - course cost just for you okay if I am on
45:20 - the live stream and if I say how much
45:22 - the course cost if this video is being
45:24 - used later and the course price has
45:26 - changed whether it's down or up it will
45:29 - just confuse the heck out of people so I
45:31 - don't want to do that to people and
45:32 - confuse them I want this video to be up
45:35 - there forever and give value to
45:37 - everybody okay so make sure you go to my
45:39 - website and you email us and what the
45:41 - hell I'll just say it it's support a
45:42 - clever programmer calm okay just email
45:45 - us there I don't care how many people
45:47 - email us there will reply back to most
45:49 - of you it's hard to reply back to
45:51 - everybody cuz there's just so many

46:12 - quizzes is Python the best language for
46:14 - this ok Tiffany I actually have
46:17 - experience with generating leads with
46:20 - creating custom quizzes with Python and
46:24 - without Python here's what I'm gonna
46:27 - tell you if your job requires you to
46:31 - know programming and build this with
46:33 - Python and integrate this with Python
46:35 - then yes Python would be a very good
46:37 - choice to make this happen
46:38 - but if you're just looking to help your
46:41 - clients generate leads so then you
46:43 - become a more profitable consultant or
46:47 - they pay you more and you become that
46:48 - trusted advisor you don't have to do
46:51 - this task on your own you can use an
46:53 - amazing service like typeform comm or
46:55 - you can use Survey Monkey comm to create
46:59 - custom quizzes
47:01 - and qualify leads essentially okay I
47:03 - assume that's what you're trying to do
47:05 - right you're trying to ask your leads if
47:07 - Tiffany asks a question in here just let
47:09 - me know in the stream but basically what
47:12 - you're trying to do I assume is help
47:14 - your clients qualify the leads that
47:17 - they're getting and make sure that
47:20 - they're good leads right these are
47:21 - people who actually will not waste the
47:23 - time of your clients so something like
47:26 - typeform calm is great it was awesome
47:30 - for me when I was trying to get
47:32 - one-on-one students for clever
47:33 - programmer and work with them one-on-one
47:35 - and do mentoring now I don't do as much
47:38 - mentoring I've pretty much I haven't
47:41 - been doing one-on-one mentoring for a
47:42 - while because I want to provide content
47:45 - to all of the students so that's why
47:48 - I've kind of stopped but I was using
47:49 - type form for that hopefully that
47:51 - answers your question Tiffany but again
47:54 - if you want to use something with Python
47:56 - look into Django and you'll be able to
47:58 - put together custom quizzes fairly
48:00 - easily look on Stack Overflow and now
48:02 - point you in the right direction thank
48:03 - you for the $5 donation
48:10 - [Music]
48:20 - yeah qualified leads from social ads I
48:23 - figured yeah cool Glenn says I would
48:32 - like to do a CRM project awesome Glenn
48:37 - you can use Python for a CRM project as
48:40 - well I in my part two video why best
48:44 - programmers are bro or my most
48:46 - programmers were broke
48:47 - I literally show you again that app that
48:49 - I made and I show you some behind the
48:51 - scenes code and that AB that client paid
48:53 - me twenty thousand dollars for that app
48:55 - is actually made with that app I made
48:59 - and the project was on CRM so I built a
49:02 - customer relationship management system
49:04 - for my clients and I give you guys a
49:06 - little sneak peek of the work that I did
49:09 - and some of the work that was involved
49:25 - this last teams livestream song is
49:28 - pretty cool I like answering technical
49:29 - questions it's me going also it's
49:35 - probably the monster Matt you're welcome
49:37 - hey guys um on YouTube or wherever who
49:43 - was able to download the portfolio and
49:45 - it worked well for them just say what
49:51 - should we have them say he always my
49:59 - friend all this comes up with one okay
50:01 - so say one if you were able to download
50:07 - that portfolio and it worked well for
50:09 - you
50:09 - also I'm scared my live stream might die
50:12 - on Instagram let's just check it out 9%
50:16 - keep it reminding me to check it out
50:24 - okay so monkey just monkey monkey three
50:29 - two one six just emailed us so just
50:33 - respond back and let's see what's going
50:37 - on here okay
50:40 - yeah alright so for people it worked for
50:44 - some people it did not work somos thank
50:48 - you so much for moderating the chats he
50:50 - says he has school tomorrow
50:52 - yeah thank you thank you thank you and
50:54 - you did a great job Tomo enjoy your
50:56 - school
50:57 - somebody says 0.5
51:08 - why couldn't you download it Naruto yeah
51:15 - it's supposed to show you the final file
51:17 - and in that final file when you click
51:19 - it's a folder when you click in it it
51:22 - has index.html come here dude just so
51:28 - they can see your face your face looks
51:29 - on point they want to see you from now
51:39 - they're gonna think I'm crazy and I'm
51:40 - just talking to myself just say hi to
51:43 - them they miss you there we go that's my
51:50 - boy Mustapha goes by Clark Co CLU X I
51:55 - owe Glen link is in the description my
52:05 - friend so go ahead and do that
52:16 - guys just go go through the video I've
52:18 - put together for you that will help you
52:21 - get the portfolio alright anyways now
52:25 - let's talk a little bit about Python
52:27 - frameworks so there are two big
52:29 - frameworks Jango and flask like I've
52:31 - mentioned here are my recommendations
52:34 - flask is pretty simple but the problem
52:38 - is that okay let's just talk about
52:41 - quickly what a framework is so if you
52:44 - were to do web development Python you
52:46 - would have to pull out your hair
52:48 - not because of Python Python is awesome
52:50 - but because web development you'd have
52:52 - to write all your own code but if you
52:54 - use a framework with Python like flask
52:58 - the benefit of that is that it does all
53:03 - the big heavy lifting for you that you
53:05 - don't have to worry about anymore so
53:07 - creating servers and making things go
53:09 - online on a website
53:11 - okay make other people be able to see
53:13 - your website it's super easy you can do
53:16 - it with just a few lines of code flask
53:18 - is super light weight again as I'm
53:22 - talking write these things down flask is
53:25 - pretty lightweight and it's cool but the
53:28 - problem is because it's too lightweight
53:29 - sometimes it's you have to write a lot
53:31 - of code to make things work whereas
53:34 - Django is a little bit more advanced
53:37 - looking and can be confusing sometimes
53:40 - but it's what we call batteries included
53:43 - and it comes with a lot of libraries a
53:45 - lot of big things juicy meaty things
53:49 - built in there so think of it like bunch
53:52 - of developers who gave up and had
53:55 - sleepless nights God probably divorces
53:59 - because it works so hard and like got
54:01 - huge eye bags writing all this code and
54:04 - creating this amazing thing for you and
54:06 - now you can just steal it with just a
54:08 - few lines of code and use it okay so
54:11 - think of it think of Django like that
54:13 - and you could build things pretty
54:15 - quickly so me I'm personally more a fan
54:19 - of your mic is too good I can hear you
54:22 - gulping down what are you drinking I'm
54:26 - drinking monster and I did not know you
54:29 - guys could
54:29 - hear me gulp okay somebody just said can
54:33 - we see more cluck Co I don't know guys
54:36 - do you guys want to see more of cluck Co
54:43 - how much would that ya type one all was
54:46 - his idea to type one how much would that
54:47 - suck if they're all like none of us want
54:49 - to see you like they just start typing
54:51 - zero
54:52 - oh yeah we should do that have you
54:58 - delirious
55:02 - yeah create apps and land your first
55:05 - climb with Python course it will be
55:07 - pre-recorded but you'll get each piece
55:10 - of content like a week from now like
55:13 - every week essentially oh man
55:24 - oh man Akash Renaldo all right you heard
55:32 - him this is what they want somebody just
55:37 - says a child's kids yell okay come on in
55:40 - bro what's up everybody how you guys
55:44 - doing clicks you back again welcome back
55:46 - to Ghazis livestream all right click Co
55:53 - so talk about some technical Python
55:55 - stuff and help I will not be able to
55:57 - answer any of those questions but uh if
56:00 - you guys need some photography help
56:02 - YouTube help I got you guys yeah he's
56:05 - just a pretty face
56:06 - for this live stream we both got our
56:10 - like haircuts today I was looking on
56:12 - point my hair is kind of messed up right
56:14 - now yeah I didn't gel it up or anything
56:16 - but straight out of the shower we are
56:17 - looking fresh yeah yeah this guy's been
56:21 - like my brother we we became friends
56:23 - when dude like when we were 10 years old
56:26 - like 10 years old I heard those of you
56:29 - guys who don't know hilarious okay
56:36 - sorry guys all right inappropriate back
56:40 - to the live stream
56:42 - about I I was born in Pakistan and I was
56:46 - born in a very very very small city that
56:48 - most of people don't even know exists
56:49 - its called Peshawar and every time I say
56:52 - that to people they're like ha ha
56:54 - pshh our like a pee shower I always get
56:57 - a kick out of it
56:58 - and he was born in Pakistan as well but
57:00 - he was he's from Karachi okay
57:03 - so literally everybody who comes to
57:06 - united states from Pakistan it's not
57:07 - like two cities okay its Karachi and
57:09 - Islamabad and that's pretty much it
57:11 - every other city nobody makes it out of
57:13 - there and you know nobody does they're
57:17 - all just stay in Pakistan even though to
57:19 - try to come to America I came here at
57:22 - the age of nine and then I met him about
57:24 - when I was ten years old and then we we
57:27 - have known each other since then so it's
57:30 - been a long journey I'm now 23 years old
57:32 - and yeah we used to be like little tiny
57:35 - babies and we used to make these stupid
57:38 - videos and now we grew older and we
57:40 - still are little tiny babies that make
57:42 - stupid videos except now we just have
57:44 - beards oh yeah that's literally the only
57:47 - difference 30 year long time friends
57:50 - damn yeah they know we were that old no
57:53 - no not 30 okay fine I'm not gonna I'm
57:58 - from Kazakhstan exactly it's pretty much
58:00 - the same thing as long as none mean it's
58:02 - just a little spelling difference Wow
58:07 - pom pom laughing emoji love the glasses
58:12 - mine or cozies I'm from India cool cool
58:18 - I'm it's not such a small it's not such
58:21 - a small city Lahore Aslam but I'm from
58:23 - India cool cool pretty cool the shower
58:28 - can now be called a small city grew up
58:32 - in Chicago all right okay so oh we're
58:37 - going offline on Instagram I want to
58:39 - give you value before Instagram goes
58:42 - offline okay so I have one minute and 20
58:44 - something seconds okay give a round of
58:48 - applause to cluck Co so send the
58:50 - clapping emoji okay so web development
58:53 - django developers make about a hundred
58:55 - and ten
58:56 - and dollars a year jingle is my more
58:58 - preferred framework it's a little bit
59:00 - advanced but if it's taught to you the
59:02 - right way you can pick it up fast and
59:05 - then you don't have to look back jingo
59:07 - is my preferred way to go write that
59:10 - down
59:10 - second best text editors or coding
59:15 - editors for python so there are a lot of
59:17 - them there is sublime text there is at
59:20 - hum and then there is PyCharm sublime
59:23 - text and atom you can use
59:26 - interchangeably sublime text that
59:29 - annoying thing is it keeps asking for
59:30 - purchase whereas atom is completely free
59:32 - so you guys can just download atom to
59:35 - write your code in pie chart is my
59:38 - personal favorite IDE or let's just
59:42 - simplify and say coding editor it's my
59:44 - favorite but I would recommend you guys
59:46 - to get into pycharm
59:48 - around the second or third month mark of
59:50 - your coding because it is a little bit
59:52 - more technical and it is a little bit
59:55 - more advanced and in the start it might
59:57 - confuse you more than it helps you
59:58 - because of how big it is but again is
60:01 - just a few practical things you need to
60:03 - know and then boom boom boom you're all
60:04 - caught up look at this how many collapse
60:06 - you're getting all right oh damn it I
60:09 - couldn't give my outro to San Instagram
60:12 - it's okay Instagram still knows we love
60:14 - them
60:15 - ok just saving it and then I'm gonna hit
60:17 - share um coo coo coo coo coo cool
60:22 - alright so for someone who wants to
60:26 - enter into web dev what would you advise
60:29 - them Jango seems challenging with their
60:31 - setups and admin Django is honestly
60:36 - pretty simple to get started with just
60:40 - the starting part is sometimes tricky
60:42 - but once you get past a little bit of
60:44 - starting time it's pretty easy to build
60:46 - things up really fast with Django so
60:49 - again I'm a huge fan of Django but if
60:52 - you have extra time in your life learn a
60:55 - little bit of flask maybe spend a week
60:57 - learning flask and that will show you
61:00 - the things you need to be doing with web
61:04 - development and how you're doing them
61:05 - because you're gonna be writing each
61:07 - line of code yourself you'll get a good
61:09 - grasp
61:10 - what the heck is going on and then when
61:11 - you do them in Django you'll just be
61:13 - like oh it's just like this thing I did
61:14 - in Flast except it's easier now and it
61:16 - won't confuse you okay so that's really
61:18 - it and let's put this or actually I'm
61:30 - sorry I'll just do it okay got it
61:37 - see easy PC selfie stick guys this is
61:43 - awesome by the way boom you can increase
61:46 - it boom like this then it has this
61:52 - remote the Bluetooth so you can press
61:54 - this button to take a picture you can
61:56 - change it landscape or portrait mode for
61:59 - your phone and this Bluetooth thing it's
62:02 - like a remote and it even comes out and
62:04 - then you could put this far away and you
62:06 - could take a picture and then last thing
62:09 - I didn't show you guys this is pretty
62:10 - cool you get actually it has a little
62:12 - tripod and boom you could put it on the
62:16 - table you know and then set it up and
62:19 - there you go and it's very compact once
62:23 - you pack it up looks like this man I
62:25 - should be doing some affiliate marketing
62:30 - all right
62:37 - yeah free advertising unfortunately but
62:44 - feel free to super chat me on YouTube so
62:47 - if you super chat me and pay me money I
62:49 - will love you and I will answer I answer
62:53 - everybody's question but I might go
62:55 - deeper into your question but just make
63:00 - sure it's a good question unfortunately
63:04 - I'm not getting paid to advertise that
63:06 - but I should be um Elias says do you
63:11 - play any video game if so which ones I
63:15 - used to play a lot of video games and
63:18 - love them but again as the title of the
63:21 - stream which has build your own Python
63:23 - freelance character what I realized was
63:28 - my life was like a game and if I built
63:32 - points I could stay with them and they
63:33 - don't like leave you when you end the
63:35 - game and that's when it hit me and I
63:39 - just stopped playing video games and
63:41 - like before I would guilt myself and be
63:45 - like why am I having just a conversation
63:46 - I'm talking about when I was young like
63:48 - twelve thirteen and I'd be like what am
63:50 - I talking with people I could be
63:52 - spending this time in the video game and
63:53 - my character would be leveling off now
63:55 - we're now about to play a video game I'm
63:57 - like why am I gonna level up my
63:58 - character in a video game when I could
64:00 - be leveling up my character in real life
64:02 - me and building those skill points up so
64:05 - now when I closed the game the character
64:08 - is still there and when I sleep and wake
64:10 - up the character is still there and if
64:12 - my hard drive is lost or my playstation
64:14 - is broken or my xbox is broken or my
64:16 - computer is broken or the lights go on
64:18 - out in my house the character is still
64:20 - there and then in life I just had to
64:23 - decide which character I was gonna be
64:26 - building and at some point I was like
64:28 - okay you know Python freelancing from a
64:30 - courier situation I was trying to do IT
64:32 - absolutely hated it and then I'm like
64:35 - okay I'm not gonna be building IT
64:36 - character I hate that freaking character
64:38 - and then I found Python and then in
64:41 - Python I found freelancing and I'm like
64:42 - okay I'm gonna be building a Python
64:44 - freelancing character and boom boom boom
64:46 - let's go and that's when I really
64:48 - stopped playing games
64:49 - laughs hilarious Rose shraddha says Kazi
64:52 - level 23 yes
64:58 - geo says what's your skills besides
65:00 - Python and Django absolutely none I'm
65:03 - useless don't really know anything just
65:05 - get by with luck okay other skills I
65:17 - couldn't see any question so I guess
65:19 - it's time to brag bring out the big guns
65:20 - not really but other skills you kind of
65:23 - have to know as a developer they're not
65:26 - that many but and you can learn them as
65:28 - you go and they're kind of
65:30 - interchangeable and mixed together okay
65:31 - so for example I know multiple skills so
65:35 - when you know Python and you know Django
65:37 - there's some other things that you end
65:39 - up learning along the way without even
65:41 - trying so html/css that's one of those
65:45 - things you end up learning okay maybe
65:47 - you can learn other tools like
65:49 - JavaScript okay
65:51 - and we'll get more into that and maybe
65:54 - later actually in the next livestream
65:56 - I'll talk about api's all right I'll
66:01 - talk about api's I'll talk about HTML
66:04 - and CSS and how it all connects with
66:07 - Python I'm taking these notes so I could
66:09 - talk about this and um got to take them
66:13 - faster
66:19 - actually have a better idea why don't I
66:21 - do things that you guys want instead of
66:23 - coming up with my own things which I'm
66:24 - pretty good at but you guys are better
66:27 - at it because you know what you want
66:28 - more than I do
66:29 - so in the comments for the next
66:32 - livestream why don't you guys tell me
66:34 - what I should cover and what you guys
66:37 - would like to know and if those things
66:38 - were good
66:39 - maybe I'll go over them in the next
66:41 - livestream and just keep looking at the
66:44 - chat whenever you get a chance so we
66:46 - know what things cuz sometimes what
66:47 - happens is we close out and then the
66:49 - last chat goes away and we lose
66:51 - everything
66:51 - oh yeah that's a good one front end back
66:55 - end I forgot yeah that's a good one
66:57 - front end talk about back-end front-end
67:01 - back-end and full stack Jesus okay I
67:11 - also don't want to overwhelm you guys
67:14 - with too much in one so I'm gonna be
67:16 - trying to give you one tip after another
67:18 - and I'm gonna be trying to go live every
67:21 - single day so don't miss out and before
67:25 - I continue forward again guys all of
67:29 - this and more I've put together the
67:31 - profitable programmer masterclass for
67:32 - you so you can learn all of these things
67:34 - and more get your first client in less
67:37 - than 90 days get that first paycheck
67:39 - with Python so go in the link click it
67:43 - and then sign up for the master class
67:45 - I've put together three amazing powerful
67:48 - life-changing videos for you guys in
67:50 - there that will guide you through from
67:52 - what the hell is going on what is web
67:56 - development how much can you be earning
67:58 - what's sure Python earning potential all
68:00 - the way through giving you portfolios
68:03 - that you can literally download and
68:04 - steal learning potential calculators
68:06 - that you can steal and use for yourself
68:07 - so you can figure out what you'll be
68:09 - earning as a Python freelancer along
68:11 - with the roadmap that you can follow to
68:14 - become that Python developer slash
68:16 - freelancer slash somebody who wants to
68:19 - do it as a side hustle or work for big
68:21 - companies in less than 90 days okay
68:25 - without needing a degree without needing
68:27 - any experience without needing any
68:29 - technical skills and without
68:33 - your age being you're in high school or
68:35 - you're about to retire okay so go in the
68:39 - links right now in the description and
68:41 - get on my master class the profitable
68:44 - program or master class it's in the
68:46 - description on Facebook and it's in the
68:48 - description click the link on YouTube
68:50 - and do it now
69:08 - okay that's a good one Julian asks how
69:11 - the hell to use github and she says it
69:18 - with two exclamation marks okay so we're

70:16 - but if you are ready and you want to
70:18 - just look at it and you're interested go
70:19 - to upward calm and just type in Python
70:21 - jobs okay that will tell you what kind
70:24 - of jobs you could be doing but again
70:26 - these are things that I'm gonna be
70:28 - helping you guys go through step by step
70:30 - and that's my goal to help you get that
70:32 - client and know what framework or what
70:35 - system or what roadmap to follow to be
70:37 - able to do that and get past all those
70:39 - problems
70:44 - Patti Pugh says I would like to know how
70:47 - much if any sequel is used in relation
70:49 - to Python when you use flask you have to
70:53 - know quite a bit of sequel but if you
70:56 - use Django there's something called an
70:59 - ORM there is an ORM in flask as well and
71:02 - it's called it stands for an object
71:06 - relational relation mapper
71:10 - okay so an object relation mapper ORM
71:14 - write this down but this won't be
71:16 - important for you till maybe a few weeks
71:20 - into your web development
71:22 - start working with databases okay this
71:25 - was something that I don't know why the
71:27 - hell nobody's explained on the Internet
71:29 - and it took me literally like so long to
71:31 - figure out how to make apps and put them
71:33 - together and make them come to life
71:37 - so for you I'm gonna be saying this and
71:41 - write this down again when you use an
71:43 - ORM you really don't know you don't have
71:46 - to know how to use sequel and you could
71:48 - be using Django and sequel in and as one
71:52 - so python is sequel as one and ORM lets
71:55 - you combine the two without having to
71:57 - know sequel too much sequel but
72:00 - obviously having the knowledge of it
72:01 - would help you Hadj edge amamiya asks
72:07 - your class enough or have to follow
72:09 - other courses my class will give you the
72:12 - roadmap my course that's coming out
72:14 - mid-november
72:16 - will give you the exact how-to and all
72:19 - the code and everything that goes along
72:20 - with it and that will be enough for you
72:23 - to go from doing zero Python to having
72:26 - apps and having portfolios having the
72:29 - tools and the skill set you need to land
72:31 - your first client and that course will
72:34 - help you land your first client in less
72:36 - than 90 days okay that's the goal of
72:39 - that course along with I'm gonna be
72:41 - interviewing people from places like
72:44 - uber and Google and people who might
72:48 - even have made codecademy and I'm gonna
72:51 - try to interview the best full-time
72:53 - Python developers I'm gonna try to
72:55 - interview the best freelance Python
72:57 - developers Python freelancers and I'm
73:00 - gonna try to put it in a vault for you
73:02 - guys so you guys can also get those
73:05 - interviews and those will be massively
73:08 - valuable Cassandra Blackman says will
73:13 - there be any discussion and how to
73:15 - negotiate pay with people who want to
73:16 - hire you absolutely in the PLC videos I
73:20 - will be covering some of that and my
73:22 - course will go in a lot of detail about
73:24 - this my course will be a lot different
73:27 - because of that 85% of your financial
73:31 - success guys comes from your likability
73:34 - or negotiation skills your commune
73:36 - education skills 15% of it comes from
73:39 - technical knowledge
73:41 - I'm not saying technical knowledge is
73:43 - bad what I am saying is if you want to
73:45 - be able to comfortably support yourself
73:47 - get paid what you deserve
73:49 - travel spend time and your family maybe
73:52 - even be able to support your family and
73:53 - be able to do that as fast as possible
73:56 - you have to put you know when you're
73:59 - building a Python freelancer characters
74:00 - skill tree you want to put those skill
74:02 - points in places that get you paid the
74:05 - fastest okay and have you doing
74:08 - practical things and working on projects
74:10 - and working with companies the fastest
74:12 - and those are the skills I want to give
74:13 - you
74:14 - negotiation is a big big big skill and
74:17 - we're gonna be talking about that so you
74:20 - can learn it and you don't have to worry
74:22 - about it anymore
74:25 - throughout the video someone keeps
74:27 - coughing is another CP team getting sick
74:29 - don't worry too hard guys don't worry
74:32 - guys we drink we drink airborne and that
74:36 - helps us stay on sick actually immune
74:41 - and makes us a mute all right should I
74:46 - continue watching live or watch part 2
74:49 - if you're here sign up right now to the
74:52 - master class and start watching the
74:56 - second video watch the first video and
74:58 - watch the second video they're both very
75:00 - important and they're tied together if
75:02 - you just skip ahead to two you're gonna
75:05 - miss out on what the heck is going on
75:07 - and my friend just put the link in below
75:10 - so go ahead and click that link and join
75:14 - it Elias says I'm a community college
75:20 - student I major in civil engineering but
75:22 - I'd be recently huh I've you recently
75:25 - started to become interested into
75:27 - programming any advice
75:31 - watch and take online courses that might
75:34 - be free so you can just kind of get the
75:36 - idea of it and then if you're interested
75:38 - invest in some courses good quality
75:41 - courses but work on practical skills
75:44 - okay also try to find mentors in real
75:47 - life so places like meetup groups or
75:50 - helpful all right but in the start in
75:52 - the absolute start I want you to spend
75:54 - more time playing and building fun
75:56 - things rather than going through
75:58 - tutorial after tutorial like you have
76:00 - some kind of purpose and burning
76:01 - yourself out so if you're starting out
76:03 - my advice is have fun doesn't matter if
76:06 - it takes you like you know a month or
76:09 - like 15 days to make a simple
76:13 - I don't know age calculator app it
76:15 - doesn't matter what matters is you have
76:18 - fun as you go along you feel like you
76:20 - did it on your own you gain that
76:21 - confidence and you enjoy it
76:23 - you have your full lifetime ahead of you
76:26 - to get better alright and I'll show you
76:28 - guys hacks to get better faster my whole
76:33 - thing is getting fast better faster in
76:35 - months and not years alright and that's
76:39 - what I want to help you do I want to
76:40 - help you become Python developers and
76:42 - freelancers in months and not years
76:50 - zakir says young savage while you
76:52 - trapping so hard well you got a 12 car
76:56 - garage but only got six cars and then I
77:01 - love that song if you guys are here on
77:03 - this live stream right down this is
77:06 - another important note Rockstar I love
77:09 - that song so much and then there's
77:12 - another song that really grew on the
77:13 - entire clever programmer team and
77:15 - whenever it comes on we just go like
77:18 - absolutely nuts it's our new mantra now
77:21 - and it's called honey but PI zero seven
77:25 - zero shake but zero seven zero shake um
77:29 - and I mean I don't know there's
77:32 - something about this song I gotta say
77:34 - it's this song as an investment it's six
77:36 - minutes and thirty seconds long but the
77:39 - more you listen to it it grows on you
77:41 - alright and just go and start listening
77:44 - to it and you you'll know what I'm
77:47 - talking about you'll enjoy it and once
77:51 - it's helpful email us and let us know
77:53 - that it was hopeful
78:02 - so I went 17 minutes above time for you
78:06 - guys because I did not we kept delaying
78:18 - the livestream is supposed to be like 2
78:20 - p.m. then we had to push it to 5 and
78:22 - then we have to push it to 6 thank you
78:24 - guys for still showing up so that's why
78:27 - I'm you know going above time we're
78:29 - supposed to be just hour exactly but I'm
78:32 - going above let me know is this has this
78:34 - been helpful and valuable to you so far
78:39 - somebody says hey honey 0:07 that's not
78:42 - it
79:12 - nice patty Pooh says I can answer that -
79:17 - found him right after I was laid off
79:19 - bored and watching beauty gurus on
79:21 - YouTube been following him since I have
79:24 - hope now awesome
79:26 - patty Pugh glad to hear that and guys
79:29 - here here's one thing I always say is
79:31 - just as easy to stay exactly where you
79:34 - are and it's just as easy to continue
79:36 - growing simple hacks that I have done to
79:40 - get a lot of results and I'm not saying
79:42 - I'm the best I'm not I'm not even a
79:43 - Python expert I just got I had mentors
79:47 - and I followed kind of the you know the
79:49 - right things quote-unquote that just
79:51 - gave me this giant big shortcuts and
79:54 - regardless of me lacking in school and
79:57 - being one of the worst students
79:58 - seriously like really low GPA terrible
80:01 - scores on my high school AC T's and yeah
80:05 - just and these were the things that
80:07 - helped me and some simple things I'll
80:09 - tell you now is it's just as easy to sit
80:11 - while you're eating food and watch
80:13 - stranger things or I don't know I forget
80:15 - what other shows are there sweet suits I
80:18 - always say house of court suits or
80:21 - office Game of Thrones yes thank you
80:24 - there we go it's just as easy to sit
80:27 - there and watch that as eating food and
80:30 - just watching something on Python and it
80:34 - you don't have to make it feel like it's
80:36 - some kind of thing that you have to do
80:38 - and if you don't do it it's like
80:40 - homework assignment it's like work just
80:42 - think of it like oh cool like sweet I
80:45 - get to learn this and right after I'm
80:47 - done eating food you know what I'm just
80:48 - gonna put together something for my
80:50 - friends it's gonna be hilarious it's
80:51 - gonna be an insult generator and it's
80:53 - gonna be hosted on here Okuda in Roku
80:55 - which lets you put your websites online
80:57 - and you could be like they could just go
81:00 - to it and type in and you know type in
81:02 - whatever or type in their name and it
81:04 - automatically generates an insult or
81:06 - maybe it automatically generates a
81:08 - compliment so they go to your little
81:10 - Python app that you made and they type
81:13 - in you know raffia qazi my name is Rafa
81:16 - kasi and it says Rafa cause you are
81:17 - awesome and then and if somebody else
81:20 - types it in you know clucks your Mostafa
81:21 - types it and he goes most of all it says
81:23 - most of
81:24 - you're great or must have a you rock but
81:27 - if you want to create an insult
81:28 - generator it could be like most of how
81:29 - you suck most of your horrible and it
81:31 - could just be hilarious
81:32 - so have fun and have these ideas that
81:35 - make you have fun with it and then
81:36 - you'll improve at the same time having
81:39 - fun and then you'll improve a lot faster
81:43 - it's like how animals learn they don't
81:46 - sit there like the tiger dad is not
81:50 - going like has a whiteboard and this is
81:52 - how you run this is how you hunt they
81:55 - just let the kids run around and have
81:56 - fun and then figure out how to do all
81:59 - that same way if you kind of learn
82:02 - football soccer or basketball instead of
82:05 - having a teacher sit there on chalkboard
82:07 - teaching you theory for also long just
82:10 - go out and kick the damn soccer ball
82:12 - have some fun with it
82:13 - try to do some tricks and mess up try to
82:16 - shoot shoot it in the hoop and mess up
82:18 - its who cares if your form is off who
82:20 - cares if you suck at dancing practice it
82:23 - improve and then when you watch the
82:24 - video you're like oh I'm connecting the
82:27 - dots it's fun and I could be building
82:30 - things as I go along I could be taking
82:31 - things things from my head and putting
82:33 - them out there into the real world that
82:35 - people could use that people could share
82:37 - and could not only be fun little games
82:40 - for my friends and family and for myself
82:41 - and inside jokes which is awesome but
82:44 - could also be something that could make
82:45 - an impact in the world could also be
82:48 - something that makes me money it could
82:50 - also be something that gets me that job
82:51 - that I've always wanted and could also
82:53 - be something that becomes my way of
82:55 - being able to travel and wake up
82:58 - whenever I want to and work from
83:01 - wherever I want to I just had a talk
83:03 - with one of the students from my older
83:05 - courses Opie courses his name is nazar
83:07 - Molly and he told me that he's a cg
83:12 - generalist freelancer and the reason why
83:15 - he loves freelancing for example is that
83:17 - he doesn't have to do a - he doesn't
83:19 - have to do a commute that saves him two
83:21 - hours so one cool thing is he can wake
83:24 - up and boom be at work so he's never
83:25 - late another cool thing is that he's a
83:29 - father and he gets to spend time with
83:31 - his little daughter he gets to see his
83:34 - daughter
83:35 - grow up he doesn't have to miss those
83:37 - moments with his
83:38 - daughter those special moments and
83:42 - that's invaluable I don't know about you
83:45 - but I can't put a price on it and that's
83:47 - what I mean when I talk about a rich
83:48 - life it's not just money but it's other
83:52 - things involved in there and then he
83:55 - went on to make $1200 using Python in
83:59 - four hours so after he took my course he
84:02 - built this thing that he could use to
84:04 - automate these graphics all right and he
84:09 - was telling me that it took the team in
84:11 - Brazil seven days to do this and it took
84:14 - him four hours to do the same thing and
84:15 - he charged the same as that entire
84:18 - Brazilian team charged and he pocketed
84:20 - $1,200 and got it done in four hours so
84:23 - think about that somebody who works as a
84:26 - as a graphic artist or you know somebody
84:29 - who is working on creating animations
84:31 - and graphics and videos gets to use
84:34 - Python to automate it so even whatever
84:37 - you're currently doing you can use it
84:39 - and it could be practical it could help
84:40 - you boost your income even if you love
84:41 - your job it could help you get that
84:43 - promotion maybe you're not ready to just
84:45 - leave your job and jump into Python
84:47 - which I get can be scary I had I read
84:49 - this comment by this girl I forget her
84:52 - name but basically she said I have a job
84:54 - I'm a single mom I have to take care of
84:56 - my son and I have to take care of myself
84:58 - so I can't just leave my job but I want
85:01 - to use Python to earn that side income
85:03 - you could be doing the same thing I get
85:06 - it some of us have a lot of
85:07 - responsibilities and we can't just jump
85:09 - the ship and burn the bridges and storm
85:11 - the boats we have to go one by one so
85:15 - why not integrate Python into your life
85:17 - to become more valuable at your job
85:19 - maybe get a raise if you can't do that
85:21 - maybe do some side projects on the
85:23 - weekends and if you put in ten hours at
85:26 - $50 an hour in one or two days you're
85:29 - bringing in two thousand dollars extra
85:31 - that's twenty four thousand dollars
85:32 - extra per year if you add on another
85:34 - client or you increase your rate all of
85:37 - a sudden you're bringing in three or
85:38 - four thousand dollars extra per month
85:40 - and now you could start to maybe think
85:42 - about changing from your current job and
85:44 - going Python you know all the way
86:05 - alright alright hopefully this was
86:09 - valuable and helpful for you guys
86:12 - we have went well above our time but
86:17 - again I hope that I was able to bring
86:18 - value I was able to be of service to you
86:21 - if you've loved this trust me just take
86:25 - my word for it

86:44 - freelancer or looking to just use this
86:47 - to boost your side income these three
86:49 - videos will take you from literally zero
86:52 - coding skills to giving you the roadmap
86:53 - to becoming that freelancer or Python
86:55 - developer who lands his or her first
86:58 - client in less than 90 days and gets
86:59 - that paycheck so if you're on Facebook
87:02 - the link is in the description if you're

88:55 - videos we'll give you credit and
88:56 - everything and I think it'll be cool so
88:59 - email us at support at clever programmer
89:01 - calm and we'll do it no not $12 and one

89:13 - here and talk and you know it doesn't
89:16 - seem too hard monkey says I love your
