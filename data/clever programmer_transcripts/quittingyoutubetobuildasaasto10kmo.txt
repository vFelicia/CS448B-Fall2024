00:00 - so we are working on building a SAS and
00:04 - when I say we I don't mean we as in some
00:06 - big corporate company it's actually just
00:08 - me and Nas and so if you guys have been
00:11 - following our YouTube channel clubber
00:13 - programmer you've seen Nas on my channel
00:16 - quite a lot of times and we decided hey
00:19 - look we've been doing YouTube and it's a
00:20 - lot of fun and we want to continue doing
00:22 - it we've been teaching people how to
00:24 - code build apps it's a lot of fun we
00:26 - want to continue doing it makes a big
00:28 - impact in the world but the thing that
00:31 - really excites us and really drives us
00:33 - is actually building software we want to
00:37 - build a SASS and we want to make that
00:39 - sass work and have it make money and
00:42 - bring a difference in the world and the
00:44 - way that I could give you this analogy
00:46 - is the same as fighters fighters want to
00:50 - be Fighters yeah maybe they want to
00:52 - coach at some point maybe yeah they want
00:54 - to have students maybe they want to you
00:56 - know share the lessons that they've
00:58 - learned and they do enjoy that but
01:00 - you've seen that happen right coaches
01:02 - Fighters will eventually turn into
01:04 - coaches and they kind of get a little
01:05 - fat then they'll coach other Fighters
01:07 - and then they kind of live vicariously
01:09 - through these other Fighters and Nas and
01:11 - I kept seeing that happen where we had
01:13 - these students and a bunch of our
01:14 - students are building these apps and
01:16 - some of them are starting these startups
01:17 - and companies that are making a lot of
01:19 - money and crushing it and and part of us
01:21 - is like man we want to be in the
01:24 - ring you know we want to be in the ring
01:27 - and we want to be fighting we don't just
01:30 - want to be outside and coaching and it
01:35 - also makes us a better Coach because
01:38 - would you rather have a coach that
01:39 - hasn't fought in years as a fighter or
01:42 - would you have would you rather have a
01:43 - coach that's still fighting and then
01:45 - also coaches you and so in from my
01:48 - perspective I'm thinking even for our
01:51 - students a clever programmer it's better
01:52 - if we're actually building us off for
01:54 - ourselves trying to take it to Market
01:56 - trying to have it make money in the
02:01 - market gets proven by the market and
02:03 - then we use that to then go and teach
02:06 - right and we come and share all of those
02:09 - lessons and knowledge with you and what
02:10 - that basically also means is our
02:12 - relationship might change a little bit
02:14 - because up until now it's been student
02:16 - and teacher but I think what would be
02:17 - really cool is if it becomes a
02:20 - relationship like peers where we're we
02:22 - are just sharing our lessons and our
02:25 - journey with you and not like a teacher
02:28 - not like a mentor but just somebody
02:30 - who's doing it right now live that's why
02:33 - we moved to San Francisco that's why we
02:35 - we're setting up this brand new place
02:37 - that we're in I don't even have my
02:39 - camera set up so I'm just shooting this
02:40 - on an iPhone but we have this epic place
02:43 - here and um we want to basically build
02:46 - the software out of this and you know a
02:48 - lot of a lot of stuff has happened in
02:49 - our lives personally and we just kind of
02:53 - found a great moment to be like you know
02:55 - let's leave Nas was in Michigan I was in
02:58 - LA but it's been a dream of mine to
03:00 - build a software it's been a dream of
03:01 - his to build a software and this just
03:04 - felt like the right time our leases were
03:06 - ending and so we're like hey let's go to
03:08 - San Francisco let's be in the Silicon
03:10 - Valley be around the people that are
03:12 - building this every single day and
03:13 - let's set a goal to make $10,000 a month
03:16 - with a software and let's try to do that
03:18 - in 30 days and let's see if we can
03:20 - actually make that happen it might take
03:22 - us longer than 30 days but what we want
03:24 - to do is document that journey and share
03:26 - that Journey with you every single day
03:29 - so on our Instagram our goal is to make
03:31 - one real every day and publish it and
03:34 - share our daily Journey there and then
03:36 - on this YouTube channel we also want to
03:38 - share that Journey with you uh and if
03:39 - you're on my email newsletter we're
03:41 - going to share that Journey with you
03:42 - through the email newsletter as well and
03:44 - so you'll see us fail you'll see us
03:46 - learn and you can laugh at us you can
03:49 - laugh with us whatever you want but the
03:52 - main thing you'll get out of it is
03:53 - lessons hard learned and hard-earned
03:57 - lessons and we will share all of those
04:00 - shamelessly and if we fail every single
04:02 - day for 10 days or 100 days or 365 days
04:06 - you will see it all of it our goal is to
04:09 - not hide it our goal is to share it all
04:11 - because it's one thing to be successful
04:13 - at doing YouTube and teaching and also
04:16 - being a good software developer but it's
04:18 - a completely different thing to be a
04:20 - startup founder build a SAS and make
04:23 - that SAS work so I'm excited I hope you
04:28 - join us on this journey to to us
04:30 - building a sass to 10K a month and
04:32 - beyond our first goal is 10K a month and
04:34 - I hope you enjoy it so meantime like
