00:02 - so firebase is a suite of tools by
00:04 - Google and it allows you to do a bunch
00:06 - of clever things so you can host your
00:08 - website you can have a database you can
00:09 - have authentication in the previous
00:12 - session we did a bunch of authentication
00:13 - stuff so that'd be cool if anyone's
00:15 - interested in that to go check pal but
00:17 - here you just want to have a gmail
00:18 - account log in and click on add project
00:20 - and once it once we click on our project
00:24 - you just need to give it a name so in
00:25 - this case we'll go ahead and call it
00:27 - internet and Netflix Club there we go
00:31 - Netflix go awesome and this you can
00:36 - enable or disable based on if you want
00:38 - Google and links there we go nice so now
00:42 - we're setting up our back-end so right
00:44 - now for today what we're gonna be using
00:46 - firebase for is for the deployment of
00:48 - the app so that we can actually host it
00:50 - so when you guys were actually checking
00:51 - out the link that we had previously
00:54 - which was this one so you can see it on
00:57 - the screen so the one that I'm
00:58 - highlighting at the moment
00:59 - on the code panel that link is actually
01:02 - a real link so that's a real link that's
01:04 - been deployed and we used firebase to do
01:06 - that which is really really powerful and
01:09 - it allows you to pretty much get the app
01:11 - up and running and live this really
01:13 - really quick so yeah nice let's go ahead
01:15 - and click continue mm-hmm and now we're
01:20 - gonna do is if you just tap that little
01:21 - web icon at the top I will and just to
01:25 - be very clear we're now set setting up
01:28 - set up firebase hosting right yep so now
01:31 - exactly now we're setting up firebase
01:33 - hosting keep going Netflix climate
01:36 - everything that we've done and then you
01:38 - want to take that little box yep okay so
01:40 - let's register okay so the next step
01:44 - where it says add firebase SDK we don't
01:46 - need to worry about that because we're
01:48 - using node modules but this step you do
01:50 - need so you're going to go ahead and
01:52 - copy that and then go to your terminal
01:54 - so I think this open up a new terminal
01:56 - and do that command yeah so you just
01:58 - simply enter that command I think it
01:59 - might not work so if it doesn't work you
02:01 - might have to add a sudo whenever you
02:03 - install something we've - G you need to
02:06 - actually have admin rights you need to
02:07 - write a sudo and sudo basically gives
02:10 - you admin right
02:11 - which is why I asked for your password
02:12 - and then you pretty much run that
02:15 - command and everything should work as it
02:17 - as it needs to
02:19 - now guys will be we will be moving on to
02:22 - deploying to firebase a little bit
02:25 - hosting our app online so yeah let's go
02:30 - ahead and I think we don't actually even
02:31 - need to go into firebase con so at this
02:33 - point we set things up idea yeah have
02:37 - enough yeah we can go into our terminal
02:41 - yeah we can pretty much set up a
02:44 - terminal and in this console most people
02:46 - if you haven't done it you're gonna have
02:47 - to just run firebase login so in our
02:51 - case firebase no yeah so we're gonna log
02:53 - out to show you guys to run a come on to
02:57 - say firebase login and that will pretty
03:00 - much so Devon gray said is there some
03:01 - fancy CDC I get related set up for the
03:04 - point to five ways so actually it's
03:06 - super teen and you're gonna see it right
03:08 - now all you have to do is 5/8 login is
03:10 - the first step and then what we need to
03:14 - do is pretty much go ahead and go to the
03:18 - terminal and do firebase in it alright
03:22 - so this is the bit that we have to be
03:24 - quite careful about guys we have to make
03:26 - sure we do it very carefully and
03:27 - correctly so let's go down to hosting
03:29 - and let's go enter
03:31 - let's get use an existing project and
03:34 - you want to make sure you find the right
03:35 - one so netflix clone there we go
03:38 - and here you need to make sure you type
03:40 - in build yeah it has to be built for
03:42 - react guys you know so you make sure
03:46 - that that is built not and you don't
03:48 - just spam the Enter key because this is
03:49 - really important configuration yeah I
03:51 - always find myself spell spamming the
03:54 - Enter key so that's important build
03:56 - right over here guys pay attention yeah
03:59 - so make sure that's build and then what
04:02 - you want to do is for the next step you
04:04 - need to configure it as a single page
04:06 - app so you're gonna put why that's
04:08 - another important things to put yeah
04:10 - that's a let me actually just in case
04:12 - it's not visible they're just but why
04:14 - yeah and hit enter
04:16 - yeah exactly and then and and then
04:20 - that's it so that's what the
04:21 - configuration done and now we have two
04:23 - things on most people
04:24 - actually end up deploying it but they
04:25 - see this default firebase page and
04:28 - that's because you need to run npm run
04:31 - build you just open up the directory
04:33 - Kazi and we can show everyone what it's
04:35 - actually gonna do so they open up build
04:38 - say you see so right now the build is
04:40 - empty as like a indexation
04:42 - amount okay okay cool yeah so it's empty
04:44 - you'll get to this point and it'll just
04:46 - have some one file in it which is
04:47 - nothing so at this point you want to do
04:50 - NPM run build and you will see what will
04:54 - happen once we actually type that
04:56 - command in as this will start to build
04:57 - out right here
04:58 - yeah and what we need to is well what
05:02 - this is doing guys it builds a
05:03 - production ready build of your react
05:07 - bundle so like your react app is
05:08 - basically stripping out the developer
05:10 - stuff like the hot reloading all the
05:13 - expensive sort of stuff that takes up a
05:15 - lot of space and stuff like we don't
05:16 - need that in the actual production build
05:18 - so when it goes online we just need to
05:21 - be as lightweight as possible all right
05:23 - we need to be a long way and just quick
05:24 - as possible so that's it so everything
05:26 - goes into that build folder and then we
05:28 - set up firebase to deploy it from that
05:30 - build folder so I think I think we can
05:33 - we can get ready for this big big big
05:35 - release now as we can say fine here we
05:36 - go guys
05:37 - are you guys ready for this we're about
05:39 - to deploy this app online and all the
05:42 - hard work that we have done up until now
05:45 - is gonna pay off and you are gonna get
05:48 - access to this app and you will be able
05:50 - to actually use it right now all right
05:52 - let's check it out I'm gonna hit enter
05:54 - vamos we're getting let's go in all
05:56 - kinds of languages that's what I'm
05:57 - talking about Laura and John is

06:04 - think it just deployed
06:09 - let's go alright let me click this now
