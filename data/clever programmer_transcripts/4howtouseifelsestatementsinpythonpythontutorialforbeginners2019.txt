00:00 - - Hey, welcome back to Python tutorial
00:03 - for absolute beginners.
00:04 - In this video we're gonna
be talking about how to use
00:06 - if else statements with Python.
00:09 - So thank you for coming back.
00:10 - Let's pick it up right where we left off.
00:12 - (hip hop music)
00:20 - So in the last video we talked about like,
00:22 - yo, how do we use functions?
00:24 - And we learned, okay,
we can make a square,
00:26 - but now, how do we use if else statements
00:28 - and add some kind of conditionals?
00:30 - Okay, so what we can say
is if elephant body weight
00:35 - or elephant weight is
greater than ant weight,
00:38 - then, you know, make a square.
00:39 - Okay, so what we're gonna do is
00:41 - I'm gonna have a elephant_weight,
00:43 - and I don't know how much they
weigh at the top of my head.
00:46 - I'll just write 3,000.
00:48 - I imagine 3,000 pounds, if
they're probably less or more.
00:51 - I don't know.
00:52 - Then I'll have a ant_weight,
00:54 - and ant_weight will be
like, let's say, hm,
00:58 - I was gonna say 20, but
they're not 20 pounds.
01:00 - Let's say 0.1 pounds.
01:03 - I don't know how much they are.
01:05 - So, cool.
01:06 - We got elephant_weight,
and we got ant_weight.
01:08 - Now, we'll say, If elephant_weight
01:11 - is greater than ant_weight,
01:14 - then make a square, alright?
01:17 - By the way, we're gonna comment these out,
01:18 - so these lines don't
work, just to show you
01:21 - what that looks like.
01:23 - I'll delete these two
lines for just a second,
01:27 - I'll hit enter, and you'll see,
01:29 - that the result, nothing
actually happened,
01:31 - and that's kinda what we want right now.
01:33 - With that said, I'm gonna move forward
01:34 - and I'll go like this, okay?
01:36 - So if elephant_weight is
greater than ant_weight,
01:40 - then make a square.
01:41 - Just logically thinking about this,
01:43 - what do you think should?
01:44 - Do you think it will make a square,
01:46 - or will it not make a square?
01:48 - Take three seconds to, three, two, one.
01:51 - Good job, you're right,
it will make a square
01:53 - because elephant_weight is
greater than ant_weight.
01:56 - Okay so I'll run this, and I'll break down
01:58 - actually what's happening
behind the scenes.
02:00 - For this statement to run,
02:03 - this statement must evaluate
to a true statement.
02:08 - We're gonna speak more
on boolean logic later,
02:11 - but everything must
evaluate to true or false.
02:13 - So when you say 3,000 is greater than 0.1,
02:17 - it will return to you an answer.
02:19 - So for example, I will comment
these out and I will say,
02:23 - comment this out and I'll say,
02:25 - 3,000 is greater than
0.1, and I'll say print.
02:30 - So it prints a result of
it, and I'll go to console,
02:33 - and console it says true.
02:36 - Now if I do 3,000 is less
than 0.1, it will say false.
02:43 - It evaluates to false,
so if this evaluates to,
02:47 - so going back to our example,
02:51 - if this part turns out to be true,
02:54 - then this part runs, the square runs.
02:57 - So in other words, if I change
this to true and I run it,
03:00 - then the square will run,
03:02 - but if I change this
part to false like so,
03:05 - like this, then it won't run.
03:08 - So either you can have
true, or you can have false,
03:10 - those are the two things you can have.
03:12 - So what we're tryna do is
make it so that it ends up,
03:16 - the statement gets evaluated
and then something happens.
03:21 - So if elephant_weight is
greater than ant_weight
03:23 - which is true, then it makes a square,
03:25 - but what we can say is,
03:27 - otherwise don't make square
03:30 - and instead just do
qazi_turtle.forward(100).
03:36 - Something like that, just go forward 100
03:38 - if that's not the case,
03:40 - but as you can see
elephant_weight is greater
03:43 - so it's gonna still make a square,
03:45 - but what if I flippity flip this?
03:47 - What if I say, elephant_weight
is less than ant_weight?
03:51 - Meaning ant_weight is
greater than elephant_weight,
03:54 - what will happen if I run this?
03:56 - Well, which you'll see is gonna happen
03:58 - is that instead of running
this statement over here,
04:00 - it's actually gonna
run the else statement.
04:03 - Now where this could be useful,
04:05 - is you could say something like
04:07 - if you're making a IG
clone later at some point
04:09 - you can say, if user has a profile picture
04:14 - then show their profile picture.
04:16 - If user does not have a profile picture,
04:18 - you can say something like,
04:19 - then show the anonymous picture icon.
04:22 - That's what happens when you
go to Facebook or whatever.
04:24 - You can say if the login
credential of the user
04:28 - on Facebook is accurate,
then let them log in.
04:32 - If not, say incorrect password
and have them try again.
04:36 - So those are some real world examples
04:38 - of how if else statements
are used everywhere,
04:42 - but what I gave you are
some simple examples
04:44 - you can use right now.
04:46 - The link to this code, by the way,
04:48 - you can access this code right away
04:50 - and if I hit share, there's this link,
04:53 - and this link you can copy
from the description below,
04:56 - you can also just paste it
in like how I'm showing here,
04:59 - and once you hit enter you can
play around with this code,
05:02 - do whatever you want.
05:03 - This is gonna be the
best way for you to learn
05:05 - and have access to it,
05:07 - and I always suggest just use Replit,
05:09 - that way you don't even
have to install Python
05:11 - and make it work, but if
you wanna install Python, I
05:15 - (lip smacking)
05:16 - have a video you can watch, okay?
05:18 - So with that said, thank you so much
05:19 - for watching at this point,
05:21 - please subscribe to the channel
05:23 - and hit the bell notifications.
05:24 - It really helps out the channel,
05:25 - but more importantly for
you it's really amazing,
05:28 - is because any types of tips, tricks,
05:31 - or motivational tips I'm bringing
out for Python developers,
05:35 - or how to make a higher income.
05:37 - Go from low, high five figure
income to six figure income,
05:42 - you'll be able to learn that,
05:43 - so subscribe to the channel
05:45 - 'cause I'm bringing the fucking
heat this year, I'm excited.
05:48 - Also, like the video if you liked it,
05:50 - or dislike the video
if you didn't like it,
05:52 - and lastly I do wanna
say that my new course
05:55 - "How to Automate Stuff with
Python" will be coming out,
05:59 - and I'm really freakin' excited for that
06:02 - and that will teach you
all the nuts and bolts,
06:04 - all of this, then some,
06:05 - project based, and most importantly,
06:08 - it'll show you how you
can start freelancing
06:10 - and earning an income with coding,
06:12 - that's always my goal for
everybody on this channel.
06:15 - So you can pop in your email below,
06:17 - I'll send you like a free
masterclass or whatever,
06:20 - and you'll be the first one
to know when it opens up.
06:21 - With that said, I love
your face as always,
06:24 - this is Qazi and in the
next tutorial video,
06:28 - I'll see you in the next video.
