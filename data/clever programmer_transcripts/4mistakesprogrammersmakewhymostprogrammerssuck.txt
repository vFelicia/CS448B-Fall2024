00:00 - that is not gonna happen you're not
00:02 - gonna get a job like that it's not gonna
00:05 - happen you're gonna be unemployed if you
00:08 - do this strategy that is what's gonna
00:10 - happen oh my god this hurts my heart but
00:16 - I had to do it I had to do it I didn't
00:20 - want to talk about this but I'm gonna
00:22 - have to talk about this these are some
00:25 - of the biggest mistakes I see
00:27 - programmers making and together we're
00:30 - gonna talk about how you cannot make
00:33 - these so let's jump right into it now
00:39 - some of these mistakes might seem really
00:42 - obvious to you but some of these
00:43 - mistakes might not be that obvious
00:47 - before I continue further into this
00:50 - video I do want to say that we are
00:52 - launching a JavaScript course and a few
00:56 - days this is our team working on that
01:00 - course right now it's about 952 p.m.
01:04 - here in California and we're gonna be up
01:08 - working until like 5:00 a.m. or
01:10 - something and for many weeks and months
01:12 - to come it's gonna be a really awesome
01:14 - course it's gonna be called profit with
01:16 - JavaScript you might enjoy it you might
01:20 - not take a look at it if you're
01:23 - interested link is gonna be in the
01:25 - description let's get back to the video
01:27 - shall we let's do it
01:29 - so let's talk about what mistakes you
01:33 - need to avoid making stop making this
01:36 - mistake number one mistake that I see
01:39 - programmers make and I see them make
01:41 - this all the time and it hurts my heart
01:43 - but this is where whenever some
01:47 - programmer a professional developer
01:49 - whoever you want to call it when they're
01:52 - given a problem oftentimes you are going
01:56 - to have this urge to just start coding
02:00 - up the solution and start typing things
02:02 - in and this thing drives me crazy
02:07 - so number one
02:11 - not learning problem-solving so I'm
02:16 - going to type that out for here okay
02:18 - mistake number one problem-solving okay
02:25 - you have to learn how to problem solve
02:28 - but what does this actually mean when it
02:30 - comes to practicality when you see a
02:33 - line of code you don't just start like
02:36 - attacking it when you see a problem you
02:38 - just start typing code up that's not
02:41 - gonna lead to more solutions what that's
02:43 - gonna lead to is it's gonna lead to a
02:45 - bug then you're gonna have another bug
02:48 - then you're gonna have another bug and
02:50 - pretty soon you're gonna be in this
02:51 - world of bugs and you're not gonna know
02:53 - what to do to get out of it why are all
02:55 - these bugs becoming a part of big
03:00 - problem for you and the application that
03:02 - you're building primarily because you
03:04 - don't actually understand the problem so
03:07 - take the time to really deeply
03:10 - understand the problem when it comes to
03:13 - programming when it comes to coding
03:14 - coding is not writing code coding is
03:18 - thinking its crystallized thought on
03:24 - applied to a computer machine the only
03:28 - the boring things are doing is actually
03:31 - writing the code the thinking part is
03:33 - actually the most fascinating so when
03:35 - you have a problem what you need to do
03:38 - first is you want to take that problem
03:40 - and you want to break it into its
03:45 - component parts okay so take that
03:48 - problem chop it up into these little
03:51 - component parts so you actually
03:53 - understand what the real problem is once
03:56 - you understand and you grasp what the
03:58 - overall real problem is that you want to
04:00 - solve you can start whiteboarding the
04:03 - solution before you start writing code
04:06 - because look here are multiple things
04:08 - that you are doing wrong you're dealing
04:10 - with multiple complexities at the same
04:12 - exact time one it's just the inherent
04:16 - complexity of the coding problem that
04:19 - you are faced with that's one two you
04:22 - dealing with the complexity of syntax
04:24 - while you're writing code you're
04:26 - introducing all this stuff at once so if
04:29 - you get a problem you don't know if the
04:31 - problem is of your thought or of the
04:34 - code so to distinguish that you need to
04:37 - first get the problem crystal clear and
04:40 - solved mentally and on a whiteboard then
04:45 - bring it in to Visual Studio code or
04:49 - whichever is your favorite piece of you
04:51 - know software for writing code and then
04:54 - start solving it so I'm gonna say like
04:56 - you know whiteboard your solution first
05:01 - and then start actually writing code
05:09 - majority of the work should be done
05:12 - before you start writing code okay I do
05:17 - this especially when it comes to really
05:18 - difficult coding problems I applied this
05:22 - when it's just something fun and I just
05:24 - want to have fun I just start throwing
05:26 - code at it because I don't want to be
05:27 - disciplined I don't want to be
05:28 - structured I just want to have fun I
05:30 - just want to write code I feel you on
05:32 - that but when it comes to a hard problem
05:34 - they're trying to solve maybe you're
05:36 - trying to integrate the stripe API into
05:39 - your Django web application so people
05:41 - can pay you or paypal or you are
05:44 - building whether ecommerce store or
05:46 - you're solving a problem on hacker rank
05:48 - or lead code I cannot overemphasize how
05:52 - important it is to actually think before
05:56 - you begin to code the reason I'm going
05:58 - on and on about this is because it's
06:00 - that important now let's move on to
06:02 - mistake number two that people make and
06:06 - I want to help you avoid it please don't
06:09 - make this mistake let's jump right into
06:11 - it so what is this this is I'm gonna
06:16 - erase this here real quick all right
06:21 - there we go so
06:24 - mistake number two okay this is not
06:30 - being resourceful what the heck does
06:35 - being resourceful mean Kazi
06:38 - here's what it means spending weeks and
06:43 - months of coding a project building a
06:49 - CRM customer relationship management
06:51 - system from scratch working your ass off
06:57 - on an ecommerce store and only to
07:02 - realize that there's already either a
07:05 - customer relationship management
07:06 - solution that exists on the internet or
07:08 - - there's already a thing called Shopify
07:12 - so you can just skip all the e-commerce
07:14 - stuff that you were gonna build these
07:19 - are very obvious examples and I'm sure
07:21 - that you're not running into those
07:23 - problems necessarily but the problems I
07:26 - see people running into are far too
07:28 - obvious that there is a solution that
07:30 - already exists online somebody has
07:33 - solved this problem before you didn't
07:35 - need to solve it so one thing I want you
07:38 - to become deliberate about in your
07:41 - career as a developer is your skills of
07:47 - online research okay
07:51 - literally become a Stack Overflow God
07:54 - and become a googling God okay I am not
07:59 - exaggerating this this is insanely
08:02 - important to your coding career okay
08:05 - might sound like a joke but become so
08:08 - damn good at these two skills that you
08:11 - can almost solve any new problem because
08:13 - you're always gonna be faced with newer
08:15 - problems because whatever application
08:17 - you're working on or something there
08:19 - isn't going to be a tutorial that
08:20 - teaches you exactly how to integrate
08:23 - Google Maps API functionality into your
08:28 - specific application whether you're
08:30 - hosting it with node or you are using
08:32 - Django or you're you
08:34 - laravel whatever stock you're using it
08:37 - doesn't matter you're gonna run into
08:38 - specific problems that you can't solve
08:40 - so how do you get past them you have to
08:44 - get good at researching okay so
08:48 - oftentimes what I would realize happens
08:51 - to me is I would be trying to solve lots
08:56 - of problems that are solved before
08:59 - somewhere and this is a huge trap
09:04 - because it's going to be a massive okay
09:07 - it's a massive time sink and you're
09:11 - literally recreating something that
09:15 - already exists okay so don't do that
09:19 - if you research online maybe like for
09:22 - example I'll give you an example instead
09:24 - of writing CSS on your own use bootstrap
09:30 - okay there's somebody who had already
09:32 - done the hard work of designing
09:36 - beautiful things or use materialize for
09:38 - the front end those things are already
09:40 - done so don't do stuff that makes your
09:45 - life difficult keep it simple for
09:47 - yourself don't may be their stuff that
09:52 - already exists on github maybe you need
09:55 - to do just a little bit of more research
09:57 - and you don't need to actually have to
10:00 - code everything from scratch you can
10:02 - look up boilerplate code that exists
10:05 - online you can look up you know Stack
10:08 - Overflow that ACOTA that exists online
10:10 - that already shows you how to solve a
10:12 - specific problem and integrate it into
10:15 - your app no need to do this all over
10:19 - again so learn how to be resourceful and
10:22 - become really damn good at things like
10:25 - stack overflowing things googling things
10:28 - and get humming things capiche let's
10:32 - continue now i'm going to talk about the
10:37 - third mistake that I see people making
10:41 - so let's talk about that shall we
10:46 - okay let's erase how can i KITT erase
10:50 - all of this mistake number three alright
10:55 - not taking chances okay so what does
11:00 - this mean in the world of developers
11:02 - what people want to do is they want this
11:05 - perfect path okay if I can draw the
11:08 - perfect straight line to success okay
11:11 - let me make it green so it's nice and
11:13 - successful they just want this like easy
11:16 - path but they all day imagine is they're
11:20 - gonna spend this much time like coding
11:22 - and then once they're done with coding
11:25 - there's this gonna be like wonderful job
11:28 - that they're just gonna get right over
11:30 - here and then that's it right so they
11:32 - just work on these projects and then
11:34 - boom there's this magical job that's
11:36 - waiting at the top of this peak and then
11:38 - they're just gonna get it that is not
11:40 - gonna happen
11:42 - you're not gonna get a job like that
11:44 - it's not gonna happen
11:46 - you're gonna be unemployed if you do
11:48 - this strategy that is what's gonna
11:49 - happen
11:50 - so how can you avoid that okay how can
11:53 - you avoid that don't wait for this
11:55 - magical job that exists at the top of
11:57 - the mountain I want you to take chances
12:01 - the entire way okay so what does that
12:05 - look like I want you to apply to
12:08 - someplace when you suck so apply when
12:12 - you have just started in your coding
12:14 - journey I want you to apply you know
12:19 - you're six months into your coding
12:21 - experience I want you to apply you might
12:22 - get a job here you might get a job as an
12:25 - intern here you might get a job as a
12:29 - junior developer right apply here one
12:36 - year into your coding experience apply
12:38 - here you know one and a half year into
12:41 - coding experience apply here two years
12:43 - into coding Spurs apply here three years
12:44 - into coding experience you should be
12:47 - applying as many chances as you can get
12:50 - because to become successful at my you
12:54 - know when I was doing my high school AC
12:55 - teens the reason why
12:57 - sucked and I got a 19 wasn't because I
13:00 - was dumb maybe that might actually that
13:02 - might actually be the final answer a
13:04 - real answer but maybe it wasn't because
13:06 - I was so stupid but maybe because I
13:08 - didn't have the skills of taking the
13:10 - damn test so in your life if you don't
13:15 - have the skill of interviewing you want
13:18 - to develop it while you are becoming a
13:22 - more badass programmer while you're
13:25 - becoming a programmer you want to pick
13:27 - up the skills of interviewing so by the
13:29 - time you're a badass programmer
13:30 - you're also a badass interviewer right
13:33 - let's say that all of these other times
13:35 - you've failed let's say you failed at
13:37 - this time you failed at this time when
13:40 - you try to applied you fail that like
13:42 - one year mark you fail at the one and a
13:44 - half year mark you failed at this this
13:46 - mark over here you failed you failed
13:47 - here but maybe just maybe at this mark
13:51 - right over here you got the job right
13:54 - right over here a boom but would you
13:57 - have been able to get this same job if
13:59 - you hadn't done all those previous
14:01 - applications I don't know maybe not
14:04 - right maybe you would not have gotten
14:07 - this job so I want you to just keep that
14:11 - in mind at all times so you are building
14:15 - up your skill as a developer your
14:18 - portfolio as a developer and your
14:21 - interview skills as a developer take
14:25 - okay this mistake I call it mistake
14:30 - number three this is not taking chances
14:33 - okay so that's this mistake make sure
14:37 - you are taking chances now let's get
14:42 - into a mistake number four forgot to
14:46 - zoom in a little bit earlier you know
14:48 - what I'm saying so what is this one
14:51 - let's delete everything let's wipe clean
14:55 - all this stuff
15:00 - okay all right here is mistake number
15:05 - four mistake number four my friend is
15:10 - not working on long projects okay what
15:17 - am I talking about I'm talking about I'm
15:20 - talking about what the hell did I just
15:24 - do
15:26 - damn I just up everything guys
15:29 - I'm sorry give me one second I'm gonna
15:31 - have to erase all this stuff and let's
15:37 - see okay not working on long projects
15:46 - right so what does this mean I'm talking
15:49 - about mega projects okay I'm talking
15:52 - about behemoths so you want to want to
15:57 - work on these monster projects people
16:01 - make the mistake of you are doing a
16:03 - tic-tac-toe project here you're doing a
16:06 - rock-paper-scissors project there you
16:08 - are doing the to-do list app you are
16:12 - building a calculator you are going
16:14 - through tutorial purgatory just rinse
16:16 - and repeat you're looking up every
16:18 - tutorial by Devitt I love that guy debit
16:21 - debit you're awesome if you're watching
16:23 - this video my man you're a cool-ass dude
16:24 - but you're watching every dev ed video
16:26 - you're watching every Brad HUS Brad
16:29 - traversée media video you're watching
16:31 - all of these videos online and building
16:33 - these small tiny mini projects all day
16:36 - long and the problem is you could work
16:39 - on 30 projects a hundred projects but
16:42 - that's not impressive at all to your
16:44 - potential employer or person who is
16:47 - recruiting what they're looking forward
16:49 - right what's the realistic scenario
16:51 - that's actually happening at a software
16:53 - developer's company they are working on
16:55 - one project Trello is working on Trello
16:59 - one project Facebook is working on
17:02 - Facebook one project uber is working on
17:05 - uber one project they're all working on
17:09 - one project instead you are going around
17:13 - like you're spending time right into
17:18 - like if we had like a bar chart or
17:22 - something right and you were thinking
17:24 - about like the time you're spending on a
17:25 - project you have like one project here
17:28 - just like little guy then you worked on
17:31 - another to-do list app project then you
17:33 - work on like another little project and
17:35 - you have like a list of these projects
17:38 - nobody cares about that what your
17:40 - employer wants to see is just one
17:42 - project that you spend a massive amount
17:45 - of time working on and it's a behemoth
17:47 - okay it's a behemoth they care about
17:50 - this nobody gives a about your
17:54 - little Tic Tac Toe robot AI game
17:57 - nobody cares so what you need to do is
18:02 - focus on the big project stop focusing
18:07 - on the little stuff so what does this
18:10 - mean take one project and work on this
18:14 - so let's say that these projects right
18:16 - let's say this was a if I have two right
18:21 - here right these are let's say one week
18:25 - projects all of them right I want you to
18:29 - think in terms of doing whoops I want
18:37 - you to think in terms of doing if I can
18:39 - make this green one year projects okay
18:49 - they're gonna be a few things that
18:51 - happen once you do this approach what is
18:55 - going to actually happen is that first
18:59 - of all you're coding skill is gonna
19:01 - improve like like you would not frickin
19:06 - believe okay so how can I move this I'll
19:10 - move this a little bit like there so you
19:13 - can see the other side of the screen
19:15 - okay so let me write here so a few
19:19 - things that are gonna happen right is
19:22 - increase massive increase in coding
19:28 - skills so your coding skills are gonna
19:31 - increase out of this world
19:33 - you will realize that one week projects
19:36 - don't help put you in flow mode but when
19:39 - you work on a one project for one month
19:41 - or two months or three months that's
19:43 - when you hit flow mode that's where you
19:44 - make massive improvements in your
19:46 - projects the other thing that you're
19:49 - gonna see happen is recruiters are gonna
19:52 - be impressed all right they wanna see
19:56 - you work on these long thought-out
19:59 - projects that's what's gonna impress
20:01 - them one project that shows your code
20:04 - this is gonna show your documentation
20:06 - skills this is gonna show your skills of
20:09 - writing clean effective scalable code
20:12 - how do you make an application that's
20:14 - secure how do you make an application
20:16 - that has a beautiful front-end you can't
20:20 - do this with one week of project this
20:22 - requires so many things for you to build
20:24 - it you are going to have to integrate
20:26 - all of those things into one thing the
20:30 - benefit of this is you are gonna be way
20:32 - more focused and you're gonna have your
20:35 - your recruiters are gonna be impressed
20:37 - and people who are willing to or looking
20:39 - to hire you are going to be much more
20:41 - likely to hire you right what's gonna be
20:43 - more impressive if you were trying to
20:44 - apply to freelance and clients what will
20:46 - be more impressive showing them a
20:47 - hundred little tiny projects or showing
20:50 - them one massive project that you worked
20:52 - on right and just linking them that it's
20:55 - your thing that you're the most proud of
20:56 - so pick things they can work on on the
21:00 - side or whatever for six months to a
21:03 - year or that's how you build amazing
21:05 - applications that is something that I'm
21:08 - a huge believer of so there you have it
21:12 - these are the top four mistakes I will
21:15 - write them down all here just to recap
21:18 - so you can see them all in one place
21:23 - okay
21:29 - okay so let's go here mistake number one
21:35 - is not problem solving okay think before
21:40 - you write code the signal to is not
21:44 - being resourceful mistake number three
21:48 - is not taking chances
21:52 - apply often and mistake number four not
21:59 - doing long doing long mega-projects okay
22:08 - I'm sorry that is running across a
22:11 - little bit did not see that okay there
22:14 - you have it my friends these are the
22:17 - four biggest mistakes that I see
22:20 - developers making all the time that is
22:22 - it for this video thank you so much for
22:24 - watching it again just a quick reminder
22:27 - we are you know if you enjoyed these
22:30 - things and you are like hey I want to
22:32 - work on like some long projects and
22:34 - you're like hey I want to learn how to
22:35 - be more resourceful and I'm gonna
22:37 - increase my problem-solving skills and
22:39 - you know if you're if you're serious
22:41 - about it and maybe you're interested in
22:43 - JavaScript as well
22:43 - my team and I right my team is sitting
22:46 - right over here Aaron just left a little
22:48 - bit earlier and he's gonna come back and
22:51 - we're gonna be just cranking this thing
22:52 - out and making it one of the most best
22:54 - amazing courses on JavaScript it's gonna
22:57 - call profit with JavaScript and our goal
22:59 - is to help you one with technical skills
23:03 - and mastering them so you know talking
23:05 - about API is you were talking about Ajax
23:07 - you want to talk about es6 you want to
23:09 - talk about advanced JavaScript we want
23:11 - to talk about Dom manipulation and Dom
23:13 - traversing and you want to talk about
23:14 - all that technical stuff we got you
23:17 - covered
23:17 - we're gonna do all of that we're gonna
23:19 - also talk about like all the amazing
23:21 - productivity tools that you can have as
23:24 - a web developer and we talked about zsh
23:26 - what I'm talkin about
23:27 - Alfred you want to talk about all those
23:28 - fancy things right we'll talk about them
23:30 - to talk about vs code and how to make
23:31 - your vs code look beautiful we'll talk
23:34 - about that in this course all right I
23:35 - will talk about all of it so those
23:38 - things interest you and you want to
23:40 - become a freelance developer will learn
23:41 - how to
23:42 - income from coating the link is gonna be
23:44 - below we're gonna be releasing it during
23:46 - Black Friday so if you missed a chance
