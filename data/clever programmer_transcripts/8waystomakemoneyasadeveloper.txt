00:00 - what's up you in this video we're gonna
00:02 - talk about eight ways to make money as a
00:04 - software developer there are going to be
00:08 - some obvious tips some not so obvious
00:10 - ninja tips and then a little bonus
00:14 - tip at the end for you guys that I think
00:17 - you're actually really gonna enjoy so
00:19 - make sure you stick around for that with
00:21 - that said let's jump right into it
00:23 - please help me beat the YouTube
00:25 - algorithm smash that like button if you
00:27 - haven't already subscribe to this
00:29 - channel because this channel is all
00:32 - about helping you become more successful
00:33 - as a developer and taking your income to
00:36 - the next level and with that said let's
00:38 - jump right into it I do want to mention
00:41 - that if you want to take your
00:42 - freelancing skills to the next level I
00:44 - have a masterclass it's in the link
00:46 - below I'm not gonna talk much more about
00:48 - it but it's pretty awesome go check it
00:49 - out let's continue I saw this video my
00:51 - first night and I was inspiring I was
00:53 - like we're gonna let me talk about this
00:55 - as well
00:55 - there are lots of different ways you can
00:57 - actually make an income as a developer
00:59 - and I feel like some of them are not as
01:02 - obvious to every single person and not
01:04 - every single person knows about them so
01:06 - in this video I'm going to share with
01:08 - you all of the ones that I figured out
01:11 - and did a lot of these personally and
01:13 - then which ones are the best you decide
01:16 - and then you go for that so let's get
01:18 - started and get into it so number one
01:21 - obviously getting a developer job okay
01:25 - so if you get a job as a software
01:28 - developer you can be making an income
01:30 - that's the most obvious let's go to
01:31 - number two you get freelance as a
01:34 - developer so what does that mean you can
01:36 - actually get say a local client to pay
01:42 - you okay so freelancing is broken down
01:44 - into many different ways because it
01:46 - depends how you actually get the client
01:50 - okay so for two will say local clients
01:54 - you can go to clients and you could go
01:58 - to meetup.com and meet people there this
02:01 - way it's easy for the people to get to
02:04 - know you like you and trust you because
02:07 - the see you face-to-face you actually
02:09 - have much more of a chance to be
02:11 - able to land a client that you meet
02:14 - locally number three you could do jobs
02:18 - on upwork.com now here's the trick with
02:22 - upwork.com if you type in and you are
02:25 - looking at jobs so say you go to the job
02:29 - section on up work and you type in
02:30 - JavaScript okay and you are looking at
02:34 - different jobs that exist there if you
02:36 - look at things that say expert developer
02:38 - and you need to be able to do something
02:40 - with data science or machine learning or
02:43 - you need to be able to do stuff with the
02:44 - pot cheat or something you're probably
02:46 - not gonna be able to do it
02:48 - okay it's gonna be a little bit too
02:50 - complex so you got to know your level if
02:52 - you're a beginner and you're
02:53 - intermediate you want to look for maybe
02:55 - not a job that'll pay you $15,000 you
02:58 - maybe want to look at a job they'll pay
03:00 - you $5,000 that's maybe building an
03:02 - online store it requires intermediate
03:04 - skill level and guess what it's gonna
03:06 - only take you a few months of experience
03:08 - to be able to build something like that
03:10 - so the eye you have to have the eye for
03:12 - what kind of project you can do if
03:14 - you're even more beginner than that well
03:16 - then don't do the thing that requires
03:18 - you three months of experience do the
03:20 - thing that pays you $300 that's most
03:24 - likely gonna be an entry-level thing
03:26 - maybe they wants you to write a little
03:28 - piece of code that can do something with
03:30 - CSV files or it tracks something on
03:32 - Amazon but those are all fairly simple
03:35 - things that you could actually be able
03:38 - to do with a few weeks of you know once
03:41 - you're past like the very basics of
03:43 - coding you should be able to actually do
03:45 - this even if you're a beginner on upward
03:47 - you gotta have an eye but upper calm is
03:51 - a great way to actually make money as a
03:54 - software developer number four tutoring
03:57 - now this is a thing that most people
04:00 - don't actually talk about and I think
04:02 - it's so fundamentally important and I
04:05 - don't know why people don't talk about
04:07 - this a lot but I think it's a huge and a
04:09 - very important way to make an income as
04:12 - a developer especially a lot of you that
04:15 - are actually learning especially a lot
04:17 - of college students and computer science
04:19 - students I think this is so important
04:21 - for you guys and not just for you guys
04:22 - but
04:23 - like personally for me and even my close
04:26 - friends we have been able to make over
04:28 - 70 $80,000 a year just from teaching
04:32 - coding to other people and before I even
04:36 - began and started doing freelancing
04:38 - how's teaching coding and the biggest
04:40 - reason is because in those days I myself
04:43 - was a beginner and so if I'm a beginner
04:45 - I am still able to teach somebody who
04:48 - has zero experience if you have two
04:51 - months of experience and you know if
04:53 - statements and you can write a while
04:54 - loop and a four loop and you can do very
04:56 - basic problems
04:57 - well somebody who has zero experience in
05:00 - coding and they don't even know how to
05:01 - write print hello world they're gonna
05:03 - relate with you really well they're
05:05 - gonna be happy to work with you because
05:07 - you're not that professor with five
05:10 - years experience or twenty years of
05:12 - experience who when like who they can't
05:15 - resonate with you know we all have that
05:17 - professor that we can't resonate with
05:19 - and we're like with the help we don't
05:21 - want to be around this guy and so you
05:23 - want to make sure that they want to make
05:27 - sure that they work with you because
05:28 - it's easier for them to relate with you
05:31 - you were in their shoes just a few
05:34 - months ago so you're actually gonna be
05:37 - better instructor for them and you can
05:40 - be charging thirty five to fifty dollars
05:42 - or more even seventy five dollars an
05:45 - hour
05:46 - teaching them if you completely suck in
05:48 - your complete beginner of course you
05:50 - can't be charging the fifty dollars an
05:52 - hour if you can't do anything and you
05:54 - have terrible social skills and terrible
05:56 - speaking skills of course it's not going
05:58 - to happen right but if you have decent
06:01 - social skills and decent communication
06:03 - skills and you have empathy and you care
06:06 - and you want to help somebody you can
06:09 - help the other person and you can be
06:12 - charging thirty five to fifty dollars an
06:14 - hour if not more so I'm gonna now break
06:17 - it down in two different places you can
06:20 - actually apply so number four I'm gonna
06:22 - say wise aunt so you can go on wise aunt
06:27 - and apply on wise ad to tutor people
06:30 - number five you can actually go to take
06:34 - since calm and apply by the way this
06:36 - video is not sponsored about wise aunt
06:38 - or take lessons those are the two
06:40 - platforms
06:40 - I used to use and my close friends used
06:43 - to use to be able to make an income
06:46 - number six I want to give this resource
06:49 - to you guys people per hour so there are
06:52 - a lot of people who are non United
06:54 - States when a constitute uhrin you might
06:55 - actually not be able to do it you know
06:59 - on wisent or take lessons because those
07:02 - I believe are primarily for United
07:04 - States so you might want to look into
07:06 - something called people per hour and you
07:09 - know Google also you can google the
07:12 - equivalent of a tutoring resource in
07:14 - your own country and people per hour is
07:17 - a good tutoring resource number seven
07:20 - code mentor now if you have any amount
07:25 - of experience in coding especially if
07:27 - you're more advanced this is not a
07:29 - beginner friendly platform so if you're
07:31 - a beginner do not look at code mentor
07:33 - dot IO but if you have like if you're
07:36 - good or you're advanced I mean this is
07:40 - your platform this is a highly it's so
07:43 - curated and it's so amazing for
07:46 - freelance developers who want to be able
07:48 - to help people and what I found on code
07:52 - mentors is the clients or also really
07:55 - incredibly skilled people and really
07:58 - amazing people in general so you're not
07:59 - working with like little kids or people
08:02 - who have no idea about coding like you
08:04 - might be working with unwise ants or
08:06 - take lessons for people per hour but on
08:09 - code mentor you're working with also
08:11 - really amazing people and so this is a
08:13 - great platform if you're skilled as a
08:15 - developer and you can actually be making
08:18 - probably one of the probably the most
08:20 - amount of money and when it comes to
08:22 - teaching on code mentor there are a lot
08:25 - of developers I know that are actually
08:27 - making six figures on code mentor and
08:31 - absolutely killing it and have a great
08:32 - lifestyle so I would look into code
08:36 - mentor number eight
08:38 - YouTube now this is a bonus one but I
08:43 - want to mention this because there's
08:44 - every developer Under the Sun is doing
08:47 - something with coding and on YouTube
08:51 - first of all of course there's me I'm a
08:53 - developer and I'm on YouTube and then
08:56 - you have Joshua fluke and then you have
08:58 - Corey Schaffer and then you have Chris
09:00 - Hawk and then you have Johnson miss and
09:02 - then you have tech lead and you got Joe
09:04 - matech I mean oh my lord the list goes
09:06 - on the point is they all figured out the
09:09 - trick which has become a developer and
09:11 - make videos so did I it works there's a
09:15 - huge niche for developers online and
09:19 - everybody and their frickin mother when
09:22 - they make a video on a day in the life
09:23 - as a software engineer
09:25 - it gets views I made one it got views
09:29 - and everybody else in the world makes
09:32 - one I just recently saw a day in the
09:34 - life of software engineer and it's like
09:35 - parenthesis New York you know one month
09:38 - ago and it has like hundreds of
09:40 - thousands of views you know I know this
09:42 - kid Chris jury's ax made go Chris Harris
09:45 - I don't know how to say his name he made
09:47 - that and then he got on the map and like
09:49 - I know forest Knight has made something
09:51 - on this like literally everybody
09:53 - including me has made something on on
09:56 - these types of titles and it just gets a
09:59 - ton of views and you could be making a
10:03 - decent amount of income from just
10:06 - YouTube ad revenue especially if you're
10:07 - getting lots of views I mean somebody
10:09 - like tech lead I mean this guy is
10:11 - probably getting what like 100 like 50
10:14 - thousand is a safe to say fifty thousand
10:16 - a month right 25 thousand Tony let's say
10:19 - plus it 25 thousand you know 250
10:22 - thousand dollars a month just from ads
10:24 - on YouTube but then he's also selling
10:26 - his own courses right I am selling my
10:29 - own products for anybody who's
10:31 - interested in my products they go to my
10:32 - website and they go buy my product for
10:35 - anybody that's interested in tech leads
10:36 - product they go to his website hit by
10:38 - his damn product the same thing with
10:40 - like Joma attack or whoever else right
10:42 - like it's a similar pattern Joshua fluke
10:45 - he has his own products and he sells
10:47 - them and you know coding dojo has his
10:49 - prod like everybody has
10:51 - get out and at this point it's not even
10:54 - like a guess it's not even a is it
10:57 - actually gonna work out for you I don't
10:59 - know who has failed but like take my
11:01 - friend Tenzin he has a channel on what's
11:03 - dev and he's doing really well with it
11:06 - everybody has a chance at least for now
11:09 - I don't know like once maybe it gets too
11:11 - saturated but like as of now it seems
11:13 - like it's fair game for every single
11:15 - person so there you have it 8 ways to
11:18 - make money as a software developer
11:20 - that's it if you like this video hit
11:22 - that like button so we can beat that
11:23 - YouTube algorithm subscribe to the
11:26 - channel if you haven't already this is
