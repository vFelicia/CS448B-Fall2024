00:00 - now so like a hundred days of
00:01 - documentation right
00:03 - which means like documentary is the
00:04 - journey and amanat is really one of
00:06 - those people who does it
00:07 - right they do it he does it as you
00:08 - should because he's had days where he's
00:10 - been stuck
00:11 - on debugging he's been days on things
00:13 - have gone really well
00:14 - and he documents everything because
00:16 - that's the reality guys and that's
00:17 - actually what happens
00:19 - so whether it's instagram facebook
00:21 - youtube
00:22 - um and also this i really want to add up
00:24 - and add on to this right
00:25 - by just writing some content as whether
00:28 - it be like
00:28 - i don't know how to write a component in
00:30 - react whether it be like
00:32 - how to style something with flexbox by
00:34 - writing that out and by teaching someone
00:36 - else it
00:37 - you're going to actually reinforce your
00:39 - knowledge of it massively
00:41 - right and that's exactly the benefit
00:45 - exactly it's like it's like that um when
00:48 - you actually teach someone you actually
00:50 - learn much more than when you try to
00:52 - learn by yourself so when you try to
00:53 - teach someone you know a certain thing
00:55 - let's say you want to
00:56 - let's say that you know you want to post
00:58 - a an instagram post
01:00 - on you know react to basics right yeah
01:03 - you know you're going to learn
01:05 - the you know the really big fundamentals
01:07 - the very important amount because you
01:08 - know you got to teach that right you
01:10 - have to know that before you teach yeah
01:12 - and so that actually forces you to learn
01:13 - even better
01:14 - right so that's why you say like record
01:16 - your entire journey post things online i
01:18 - know ahmad is doing a great job right
01:20 - amanda for example he
01:22 - is from with all that he is doing he's
01:24 - also now
01:25 - getting coaching clients literally and
01:27 - is actually
01:28 - making money at that point so yeah crazy
01:30 - stuff seriously
01:31 - do it and trust me you were um i don't
01:35 - think you will not regret that
01:36 - yeah exactly our lovely comment by here
01:39 - he said
01:40 - sunny is going to inspire me thanks a
01:41 - lot bro because of you i'm not oh that's
01:43 - good
01:43 - thank you so much amanda and i really
01:45 - love your journey and keep doing what
01:47 - you're doing bro
01:48 - nice um uh we also want to add one more
01:51 - thing here guys
01:52 - uh it's not just about like sharing the
01:54 - journey right
01:56 - by doing that without realizing you're
01:58 - actually going to be
01:59 - building like your own personal brand
02:02 - okay
02:02 - so there's one thing working in a
02:04 - company there's one thing freelancing
02:05 - and doing this sort of stuff
02:07 - but if you just get involved and you
02:09 - start sharing your journey
02:10 - i promise you guys without even trying
02:12 - you're going to actually slowly build a
02:14 - bit of momentum and traction
02:15 - as to our following you're going to get
02:17 - a natural following of people who are
02:19 - interested in coding
02:20 - and interest and you're going to get
02:21 - like a more like-minded people sort of
02:23 - naturally start to surround you
02:25 - why this becomes really useful is
02:27 - because when you start growing your
02:28 - social media presence
02:30 - let's say you start offering coaching
02:31 - sessions and you want to have you want
02:33 - to start teaching people one-to-one and
02:34 - you want to make a little bit of extra
02:35 - pocket money
02:36 - you just need to add one story on
02:38 - instagram and immediately you've got a
02:39 - thousand people
02:40 - that are gonna see that right and
02:42 - they're all coding people they're all
02:43 - like people in the developer community
02:45 - and i guarantee if you just get one
02:47 - person who replies to you that's
02:48 - potentially one person you can start
02:50 - teaching
02:50 - and you can start making that income
02:52 - from so it's not only going to benefit
02:54 - you in terms of learning
02:55 - it's actually another source of income
02:57 - so it's actually going to be a really
02:58 - powerful thing for you
03:01 - exactly exactly just there's so much
03:02 - opportunity guys seriously
03:04 - there's a ton of opportunity out there
03:06 - on social media online
03:07 - use it for your own good go out there
03:09 - put yourself out there right because the
03:11 - only way that people can see you is if
03:12 - you put yourself out there
03:14 - right and so if you do it you are more
03:16 - likely to get something back something
03:18 - like
03:19 - you know there's a there's a saying put
03:21 - good energy out and good energy will
03:22 - come back
03:23 - exactly i live in that right now and
03:26 - like nars is living
03:27 - there he's living breathing proof of
03:29 - this guys like if you go to one of his
03:31 - coaching course
03:32 - you come out of it feeling like you're
03:33 - about to wake up like it's crazy
03:36 - like it's like a rave in those coaching
03:38 - calls it's so

04:16 - move for
04:17 - during the dance and then and then i put
04:20 - other people on the spotlight so

07:03 - some salsa
07:04 - oh i'm not like right now
07:08 - all right fine fine all right none of
07:10 - the time but anyways guys let's go ahead
07:11 - and answer some questions
07:13 - you know if you guys want you know if
07:15 - your question is you know
07:16 - let's let's get signed to dance that's a
07:18 - good question as well but
07:21 - but yeah let's see what questions
07:24 - will come up because like you know what
07:26 - one thing one thing i know is like
07:27 - uh oh somebody asked nakul asked i want
07:30 - to
07:30 - do you want to put in i was like i want
07:32 - to apply for react.js internship what
07:33 - strong part should i should i have
07:35 - like what strong suits should i have do
07:37 - you have issues the question really good
07:38 - question yeah so
07:40 - uh react.js internship what strong parts
07:42 - should i have so it's really good
07:43 - question thanks for asking that call
07:45 - i would recommend that you pretty much
07:47 - um
07:48 - understand so in react you have two
07:50 - types of uh
07:51 - two ways of writing components right you
07:54 - have class based
07:55 - class based and you have functional the
07:57 - first thing is i would recommend that
07:58 - you learn
07:59 - uh very very thoroughly how to use
08:02 - both right because that becomes an
08:04 - immediate valuable skill to have
08:06 - you can go into a company and you can
08:07 - say right even if the code base is class
08:10 - based and and the difference here guys
08:12 - is one is just the older way of writing
08:13 - things one is the newer way of writing
08:15 - things but
08:15 - the newer way is really nice but most
08:17 - code bases have the older way
08:19 - so a lot of companies actually pay you
08:21 - to come in and just go ahead and change
08:22 - everything to the new uh
08:24 - the new stuff without breaking things in
08:25 - between right so if you can do that
08:27 - then uh that's definitely a valuable
08:29 - skill so i would recommend learning
08:30 - about class based and functional
08:32 - and then i would go ahead and pick up
08:35 - all of the fundamentals like react hooks
08:37 - i would look at the react context api so
08:40 - um
08:41 - for many of you guys who haven't used
08:42 - react before this could sound like buzz
08:44 - words
08:44 - um but if you are looking at react then
08:46 - just get a pen and paper on
08:48 - these down so it's react context api
08:49 - react hooks um
08:51 - and once you know about react hooks i
08:52 - would look at something called redux and
08:54 - once you know redux yes
08:55 - you're at a point where you're pretty
08:56 - much ready to jump into your first
08:58 - position
08:58 - so once you overcome that pattern and if
09:00 - you guys do want to look at an example
09:02 - of redux
09:02 - yesterday's live build of amazon we
09:04 - actually cover that so
09:06 - go and check it out if you are
09:07 - interested yeah and
09:09 - i would also say react jsx right jsx
09:12 - yeah right that's the one right yeah
09:13 - reactive effect which is the way
09:14 - a way to to write html using using
09:17 - basically react
09:18 - using javascript basically using react
09:20 - that's another another big point i think
09:22 - yeah i think to learn yeah that's that's
09:24 - definitely that's actually quite an
09:26 - essential thing you need to understand
09:27 - how to use jsx
09:28 - yeah yeah and what is the css i forgot
09:31 - because i used to use css where i
09:33 - actually used
09:33 - i built i built css with javascript as
09:36 - well what is that
09:37 - that one called i forgot um oh so
09:39 - there's a few there's css
09:41 - is sas that you made no no no there's
09:44 - one was like
09:44 - react build i forgot about that
09:51 - [Applause]
09:54 - style sheet anyways maybe i could bring
09:56 - up some later time
09:57 - yeah okay so um if you if you guys have
10:00 - any questions around that drop them in
10:01 - the comments because that's actually a
10:02 - really good question
10:03 - somebody actually said something um i
10:05 - tried to pin it okay yeah this one here
10:07 - vikrant seth said help so there are
10:10 - times when coding we feel
10:11 - like giving up in between what should we
10:13 - do at that time
10:14 - so nashville take that one
10:18 - yeah so actually a lot a lot of students
10:19 - will actually actually get this a lot
10:21 - from students
10:22 - um in terms of you know hey i don't kind
10:24 - of you know i feel
10:26 - i feel like i just can't do it
10:29 - um like my answer my answer to this is
10:32 - is honestly like i'm not trying to think
10:34 - kind of what to say in terms of
10:35 - like you know to actually give you some
10:37 - actionable things to do
10:39 - um one thing one thing i would say is
10:41 - this is not an actual one but like
10:43 - one is don't put so much pressure on
10:46 - yourself
10:47 - like why are you putting so much
10:48 - pressure on yourself that you know
10:50 - because the reason why you don't feel
10:51 - like you know you feel like giving up is
10:53 - because you put so much pressure
10:55 - and you know on building something or
10:57 - you put so much pressure that you need
10:58 - to understand something so quickly
11:00 - that now you feel like well you know i
11:02 - can't really get it that fast
11:04 - and so now should i even learn it at
11:05 - that point right yeah
11:07 - but if you don't put too much pressure
11:09 - and you make it so much more about
11:11 - hey this is a fun thing to do let me see
11:14 - how i can learn it and let me put myself
11:17 - to the challenge to actually try and get
11:18 - it
11:19 - okay if you think of it more so it's
11:21 - just a fun thing that i'm going to learn
11:23 - instead of putting so much pressure i
11:24 - have to know this
11:25 - i have to get this to get a job and
11:26 - everything then it becomes a lot harder
11:29 - yeah but if you are stuck in that
11:32 - position where you know what i feel like
11:33 - i feel like giving up one release
11:35 - yourself of that pressure
11:36 - two two find um
11:40 - like i said find may potentially find a
11:44 - actually here's one thing that i would
11:45 - say is find small wins
11:48 - yeah because wins give you confidence so
11:50 - for example let's say
11:52 - actually i would recommend this
11:53 - situation do like a small
11:55 - youtube tutorial for example okay and
11:57 - code along with that person
11:59 - maybe join a course like part of a
12:01 - javascript link in the description
12:06 - join the course for example right and
12:08 - start getting small wins
12:10 - okay maybe it's you built a small
12:11 - program maybe you built a small you know
12:13 - uh card for example maybe you build a
12:16 - small
12:17 - a small like a weather weather
12:19 - application right anything that gives
12:21 - you like a win
12:22 - like sparks interest it's like hey i got
12:24 - this let me get
12:25 - let me see what else i can get i got
12:26 - this let me see what else i can get
12:28 - and by giving yourself momentum right by
12:30 - giving him this momentum
12:32 - you can basically br you can basically
12:34 - go a lot further and now use the
12:36 - momentum basically just keep going and
12:38 - keep going and keep going
12:39 - so that is kind of like i said i would
12:40 - say my answer to that yeah what about
12:42 - you
12:42 - really really nice like how you put that
12:44 - um i would say like perseverance guys
12:47 - for me is is gonna be the number one key
12:49 - thing because like
12:50 - in coding like that you you are i'm just
12:52 - like i'm gonna put it out there you are
12:54 - going to hit
12:55 - some really tough times where you will
12:57 - be at your computer for hours
12:59 - like you will be stuck at your company
13:00 - of hours and it doesn't matter if it's
13:02 - like a very simple error or like
13:04 - a really sort of complicated era like
13:06 - i've been stuck on my computer sometimes
13:07 - for the most
13:08 - basic things guys i've probably spent
13:11 - like eight hours once like
13:13 - figuring out like how to loop through an
13:15 - array properly
13:16 - right like i said and i was like oh my
13:18 - god like and now
13:20 - you'd see me like and this is what i
13:21 - want to really sort of like kind of
13:23 - draw a straight line over is that you're
13:24 - going to see me now in tutorials and
13:26 - like nars coding
13:27 - and you're going to be like wow they
13:28 - just seem to like know everything they
13:29 - know how to write all their code but
13:31 - like
13:31 - guys that's after going through like god
13:33 - knows how many hours of like
13:35 - sitting there banging our heads against
13:36 - the keyboard like like oh my god i want
13:38 - to quit i want to give up i'm not built
13:40 - out for this like
13:41 - it's a normal feeling and the number one
13:43 - thing i will say is just
13:44 - keep on moving forward like keep on
13:46 - going like don't just
13:48 - do not quit because i guarantee and this
13:50 - is why i love coding so much that rush
13:52 - that you get
13:53 - when you overcome that problem finally
13:55 - at the end that rush is unlike anything
13:57 - else like i
13:58 - to be honest i'm yet to find something
13:59 - which matches it like when i'm sat there
14:02 - bugging for like eight hours and i
14:03 - finally get my code working
14:06 - and then you deploy it and you do all
14:07 - your stuff and then you can go about a
14:09 - day
14:09 - it just sets you off from such a good
14:11 - mood and it's like the best i know
14:14 - yeah it's like it's like you realize oh
14:16 - man
14:17 - i missed a semicolon and that took you
14:19 - about eight hours to figure out
14:20 - yeah like at one point you're like
14:22 - really mad but you're also like
14:24 - hell yeah yeah exactly like in the
14:26 - beginning you're kind of like in this
14:28 - this weird place of like i'm really
14:30 - angry and disappointed with myself but
14:32 - i'm also like the most happiest i've
14:34 - ever been
14:36 - yeah yeah there's a lot and i think
14:38 - there's a very big joy i get personally
14:40 - like from building like a project like
14:42 - like like right now for example guys
14:44 - like really cool project that we're
14:46 - building right now with
14:47 - students actually check this out hold on
14:49 - maybe i can send you a link hold on hold
14:51 - on maybe you can actually share this
14:52 - let me see um we're building kobe
14:55 - tracker guys we are building a covey
14:57 - tracker and it's actually me and sunny
14:58 - are going to be doing by the way
15:01 - this is like a really cool announcement
15:02 - me and son are going to be doing a cover
15:04 - tracker building a cover tracker with
15:06 - react next monday next monday
15:09 - so drop in the comment below if would be
15:11 - excited
15:12 - to build something like this because
15:14 - it's something that's completely new
15:15 - right
15:16 - it's going to look amazing it might
15:18 - actually look something like this so
15:19 - actually let me see
15:20 - let me let me give you a link that you
15:22 - can probably show to them as well
15:23 - yeah uh so guys let us know in the
15:27 - comments while nars is finding that if
15:29 - you're excited to build a covert tracker
15:31 - uh it looks amazing this app looks
15:33 - really nice and we're going to show you
15:34 - how to build it
15:35 - and this is a complete beginner tutorial
15:37 - guys so it doesn't matter if you don't
15:38 - know how to code
15:39 - you can go along with us and you can
15:40 - build this as well and you can add it to
15:42 - your portfolio
15:43 - so okay go ahead right let me open this
15:47 - up for you guys
15:48 - so we've got no here we go
15:52 - so this is something that currently our
15:54 - students are building right
15:55 - in the profit of javascript so again if
15:57 - you want to build something like this
15:58 - and know that deep down on how to build
16:00 - this in the live coaching call so
16:02 - for example with me and sunny right we
16:04 - get to ask questions
16:05 - link is in the body make sure you profit
16:07 - with javascript
16:08 - you will not regret it yeah so here we
16:11 - have it guys
16:12 - um we have the covid 19 tracker so you
16:15 - can see like
16:16 - we can select countries from the drop
16:18 - down so if i go ahead and click this
16:21 - well you refresh it you're refreshing
16:23 - refresh it hold on okay refresh it
16:24 - start amazing and you're just not
16:25 - showing the actual case there we go
16:27 - there we go so hold on is it it's still
16:30 - not
16:30 - no i mean it might just be a delay i
16:34 - think my
16:35 - could be the internet connection
16:39 - is it working on your machine guys yeah
16:42 - yeah yeah interesting maybe uh
16:46 - sort of like but what you basically can
16:50 - do guys is you can you can select from
16:51 - this drop down you'll be able to select
16:53 - like
16:53 - the united states or the uk and it will
16:56 - show you not only it will show you like
16:57 - a live
16:58 - breakdown of country by country with
16:59 - your number of covert cases
17:01 - but it would also zoom into the map
17:03 - dynamically so imagine like it would
17:04 - literally zoom into the map at different
17:06 - points
17:07 - highlight the uk with this really nice
17:09 - circle illustration of depending on how
17:11 - many people
17:12 - have been infected with uh coronavirus
17:14 - and it will show you
17:15 - like stats of that thing and you can
17:16 - basically from this drop down click like
17:18 - international
17:19 - and this map reacts dynamically to that
17:21 - so it's going to be a really really nice
17:23 - build and again you guys will be able to
17:24 - add this
17:25 - to your portfolio so let us know in the
17:27 - comments if you find that exciting and
17:29 - if you are ready to do that
17:31 - and we will build that for you guys on
17:32 - monday can you open this up in safari
17:35 - try this up in safari actually yeah
17:37 - let's give that a go
17:39 - yeah let's try it i'm very curious why
17:43 - it's not showing up the cases on your
17:44 - side this will be interesting
17:46 - let's have a look um
17:49 - [Music]
17:51 - no let's go ahead and check if there's
17:54 - any errors
17:55 - coming back see guys
17:58 - this is this is the magic of coding guys
18:02 - there you go jquery is on jquery is is
18:05 - not different it's not defined
18:07 - interesting um
18:11 - oh maybe the shot oh maybe because it's
18:13 - very location
18:14 - based because i'm getting there's a cdn
18:15 - that's getting jquery
18:17 - [Music]
18:21 - okay all right okay okay oh
18:24 - nice yeah javascript
18:28 - yeah guys if you haven't already check
18:29 - this out make sure that you guys go
18:31 - ahead and check the link in the
18:33 - description
18:34 - uh if you've enjoyed the video so far
18:36 - and you found that some of the advice
18:37 - that we gave you is pretty useful
18:39 - then you can go ahead and check out this
18:41 - is pretty much where me and nars live
18:43 - we live inside of the community and guys
18:46 - we own this course
18:48 - yeah we live here like very much inside
18:50 - of this course
18:51 - like we offer a bunch of so not only do
18:53 - you get personalized video feedback from
18:55 - all of the homework submissions that nas
18:57 - sets
18:57 - every week in your coaching course so
18:59 - you get live
19:00 - feedback you get success coaches you get
19:03 - weekly
19:03 - javascript and react training calls so
19:05 - that's all of the javascript
19:07 - fundamentals and pretty much from a to z
19:09 - in javascript
19:10 - with nars and with me you'll be building
19:12 - uh fun little react apps that we can
19:13 - pretty much go in and
19:14 - and guys like when you build these apps
19:16 - you pretty much have like you can
19:17 - message me on slack you can come and
19:19 - show me your code
19:20 - i love to see what you guys build and
19:22 - yeah you can message us through slack
19:24 - and also guys these are it's all cool
19:25 - knowing how to learn how to code in
19:27 - javascript right but the main thing we
19:28 - want to do is show you
19:30 - how to make a killing with that through
19:32 - those skills yeah
19:33 - we're going to show you how to go from
19:35 - um being able because like this is the
19:37 - problem i find in most of these
19:38 - tutorials they teach you how to do stuff
19:40 - but they don't actually teach you how to
19:43 - actually go ahead and make some money
19:44 - with it right so we have plenty of
19:46 - different methods
19:47 - and our students are actually making a
19:49 - fair amount of money a lot of the
19:50 - students right now which is really nice
19:52 - like i love seeing um when students
19:54 - share their success stories with us um
19:56 - so yeah if you do want to go ahead and
19:58 - like you can just come check this page
20:00 - out it's in the link in the description
20:01 - and you guys can go and check that out
20:03 - for yourself awesome
20:05 - yeah check it out if you're interested
20:06 - if you by the way we do have it we have
20:08 - a 30 day money back
20:09 - so if you don't like it return it but
20:11 - you know i think i like it in either
20:13 - case
20:13 - trust me just yeah yeah you're going to
20:15 - like it just just trust me just trust us
20:18 - exactly nice um
20:21 - let's have a look at some of these uh
20:23 - things uh comments so we've got i spent
20:25 - a week
20:26 - okay so devin gray devin grey actually
20:29 - joined
20:29 - the other day so he's new to the course
20:30 - i believe um so he said i
20:32 - was a week trying to deploy my website
20:35 - to a server wondering why i can see it
20:36 - my euro only to find out my website was
20:38 - pointing
20:39 - to the wrong url yeah and then he and
20:41 - then he said he added another one he
20:43 - goes i was laughing at 4 am
20:45 - from happiness when i finally
20:49 - [Music]
20:52 - oh man the happiness you probably got
20:54 - this is it's so good
20:56 - yeah exactly like it's really gonna take
20:58 - you like it makes you so happy guys
21:00 - let's have a look um oh no this one
21:03 - might be good for you like uh so what
21:05 - are the best ways
21:06 - of flying or finding uh clients for your
21:08 - product so yeah
21:09 - i think we'll answer this in the way of
21:11 - finding clients
21:12 - um for like uh freelance projects
21:16 - yeah yeah so i think i think that in
21:18 - terms of finding clients for your
21:19 - freelance projects and i've done
21:21 - freelancing for a year
21:22 - the number one thing that i would say is
21:25 - honestly probably when you're first
21:26 - starting out it is
21:28 - through people that you know like you'd
21:30 - be surprised like how big your network
21:32 - is
21:32 - like what i would say and this is pretty
21:34 - much how i started is i literally
21:35 - started asking people like that i know
21:37 - hey do you know anybody who needs some
21:39 - work done hey do you need anybody who
21:41 - needs some
21:42 - freelance client work okay and the
21:44 - reason why
21:45 - the reason why you ask that question you
21:48 - basically you ask around for
21:49 - the people you know is because it's the
21:51 - trust factor
21:53 - yeah you're a lot more likely to get a
21:55 - job if someone trusts you
21:57 - versus if you're like hey i don't know
21:58 - who this guy is i'm not gonna i'm not
22:00 - gonna pay him
22:01 - right so the biggest thing in
22:03 - freelancing guys is honestly
22:05 - trust like that that is what
22:08 - that is basically if i if there's
22:10 - someone who
22:11 - you know there's someone who i know okay
22:14 - who maybe is a bit
22:15 - more expensive okay versus someone who i
22:18 - don't know but it's actually cheaper
22:20 - i'm gonna go with someone who i know
22:22 - yeah right
22:23 - so trust is a big fight so the first way
22:25 - is to find is through people you know
22:26 - that's part one
22:27 - part two is you can go on on websites
22:30 - like freelancer.com
22:31 - and upload.com and you can find them
22:33 - there but most important thing is
22:35 - build that connection build that network
22:37 - go to meetups
22:38 - see other people that is how you're
22:41 - going to get your freelance clients
22:43 - so yeah that is going to be my answer
22:44 - for that items honestly yeah and that's
22:46 - so
22:46 - powerful and i said because like guys
22:48 - like i thought initially there would be
22:50 - websites
22:51 - i'd have to go to but the truth is when
22:52 - i started freelancing it was all through
22:54 - word of mouth
22:55 - like everything was through word of
22:56 - mouth and i was like whoa like it was
22:57 - just somebody would randomly give me a
22:59 - call and say like oh hey
23:00 - you know so and so and i know that you
23:02 - can code and you can do stuff and i'll
23:04 - be like oh yeah sure like i can take
23:05 - this on let's have a look
23:06 - and you just start a conversation and
23:08 - before you know it like things are
23:09 - happening
23:10 - and you start working on these projects
23:11 - so like no i said go to these meetups go
23:14 - to
23:14 - these conferences and sort of be a part
23:16 - of these groups and communities
23:18 - and you will naturally start to see
23:19 - those conversations start to come about
23:22 - exactly exactly yeah awesome let's have
23:25 - a look at some more questions
23:28 - um right
23:33 - somebody said there's something said do
23:34 - i have to learn javascript in depth like
23:36 - recursion a lot all like to get a job
23:38 - and react
23:39 - uh do you see that yeah yeah so this one
23:42 - right here
23:43 - so ajinkya said do i have to learn
23:46 - javascript in depth like like recursion
23:49 - and look okay so good question
23:50 - so honestly recursion not necessarily
23:55 - is it a a valuable skill to have yes is
23:57 - a valuable skill to have i mean like
23:59 - it's cool to know
24:00 - how often do i actually use recursion i
24:02 - mean that's how often do you use
24:03 - recursion
24:05 - like clearly i use recursion you know
24:08 - how many times a day
24:10 - zero times a day
24:11 - [Laughter]
24:13 - it's one of those cool to it's cool to
24:15 - know how to do it but actually using it
24:17 - yeah i mean
24:18 - i i don't really use recursion too much
24:21 - i mean that the one time when i do find
24:23 - i actually need to use recursion
24:24 - it'll be super rare and then i would be
24:26 - like oh that's pretty cool i
24:28 - i use prevention that day like it's one
24:30 - of those things it's not it's definitely
24:31 - not an essential
24:32 - so i would actually focus on the
24:33 - fundamentals and then go ahead and jump
24:35 - into react
24:36 - and you can sort of have some fun yeah
24:39 - yeah i would say i would say
24:40 - recursion um things like that is that
24:42 - actually going to be very important
24:44 - when you guys get into interviewing with
24:45 - big companies like google and like
24:47 - facebook
24:48 - when you get into that zone you will
24:50 - have to know like algorithms you know
24:51 - recursion right
24:53 - you know um basically you know uh
24:55 - breadth first search depth first search
24:57 - binary surgeries all that stuff that you
25:00 - know
25:00 - i hate i don't like and that i don't use
25:03 - you're gonna still have to know that
25:05 - unfortunately for the
25:06 - for the interviews so yeah if you're
25:09 - gonna if your goal is to look at you
25:11 - know big companies
25:13 - you are going to have to learn it i'm
25:14 - sorry but you will
25:16 - you know especially for companies like
25:18 - google facebook and things like that
25:20 - but to be honest like i would very i'd
25:22 - really recommend because like even
25:23 - though i said you started with smaller
25:25 - startup companies and i did the same
25:26 - thing i started with
25:27 - smaller startup companies and then i
25:28 - ended up going the freelancing route and
25:30 - then i joined the team
25:31 - um so it really you really need to kind
25:33 - of decide as to like what's your sort of
25:35 - goal like if you do if your goal is to
25:37 - get into companies like google
25:39 - then i would recommend i would always
25:40 - kind of recommend just
25:42 - just like we said guys just stop just
25:45 - start get the fundamentals down
25:46 - to start getting those things ahead and
25:48 - then when you need to know those things
25:50 - start to address them then right like if
25:52 - you're going to apply to google
25:54 - know that yes you're probably going to
25:56 - need to know about like a bunch of
25:57 - different algorithms and efficient ways
25:59 - of doing things
26:00 - but before that a startup company that's
26:02 - getting off the ground that has a bit of
26:04 - funding
26:05 - isn't really going to be asking you
26:06 - about algorithms they just want to know
26:08 - can you help them build their product or
26:09 - not
26:10 - all right so and they're gonna be
26:11 - begging you they'll be begging you
26:12 - please help us
26:14 - yeah they'll be begging you and at that
26:15 - point they'll be like right like if you
26:16 - can start tomorrow like start tomorrow
26:18 - if you've got the skills to do it like
26:20 - so there's literally like that's the
26:22 - sort of conversations that you need to
26:23 - be focused about before those ones
26:24 - yeah um ashkan just dropped a really
26:27 - nice comment he goes i've joined the
26:28 - course a few days ago and i strongly
26:30 - recommend it to people who lost
26:31 - in tons of tutorials amazing stuff dude
26:34 - you'll thank me
26:35 - this is all you need better than boot
26:36 - camps amazing if you guys want to go and
26:38 - check the
26:39 - the course out link is in the
26:40 - description by the way nice
26:44 - love it love it i love seeing stuff guys
26:46 - wait who by the way drop in the comments
26:48 - below
26:48 - who has actually just got the course
26:51 - today i'm just curious
26:53 - if you actually in the court if you got
26:54 - the course today drop in the comments
26:56 - below i'm very curious
26:57 - yeah love to see that definitely would
26:59 - love to see that
27:00 - um okay this is an interesting one nice
27:03 - so stoichio
27:04 - says how you guys started programming
27:08 - so okay okay i'm gonna go first uh yeah
27:11 - i'll give it a go so
27:12 - when i was i started coding when i was
27:14 - 17
27:15 - i believe or 16 or 17. um i always found
27:18 - that the it class so like excel
27:20 - spreadsheets and things like that in
27:21 - school
27:22 - was just never challenging enough i kind
27:24 - of was naturally
27:25 - like enjoyed it so much but i wanted to
27:27 - like start to build things on my own
27:28 - accord and
27:29 - the first programming language that one
27:31 - of my teachers showed me was pascal
27:33 - now i really like sort of like yeah i
27:36 - couldn't invest out here
27:38 - like pascal was my first language and
27:40 - then i was like okay this is kind of
27:42 - cool like it's a bit challenging i like
27:43 - what you can do with this
27:45 - and then i literally bought a book off i
27:48 - had an ipad at the time like the first
27:49 - ever ipad and i bought a
27:51 - java book and i pretty much sat there
27:54 - went through that java book and i pretty
27:56 - much just
27:56 - i literally learned a fundamental about
27:59 - how to do something in java
28:00 - and i wrote a little loop and i
28:02 - basically made it loop ten times i made
28:03 - it
28:04 - 100 times and then i tried an if
28:06 - statement and i was like if this loop is
28:07 - on
28:08 - the 50th iteration don't show it like
28:10 - are you
28:11 - just making how many how many loops did
28:13 - you write sunny how many
28:15 - i went loop crazy i wrote so many loops
28:17 - and i just did so many weird things but
28:19 - like it helped me learn java
28:20 - and then i just took it and i ran with
28:23 - it like i built
28:24 - i reached out to one of my cousins who
28:26 - had a car shop right there the car
28:27 - manufacturing shop
28:28 - and i was like oh like you're currently
28:30 - using like a you just everything's paper
28:32 - based so i went ahead and i built them
28:34 - a java like a java interface like that
28:37 - like a
28:38 - nice like little ui and that had a sql
28:40 - backend and i basically
28:42 - so i took all the information so i
28:44 - actually ended up gathering like user
28:46 - stories
28:47 - from them without realizing at the time
28:50 - and
28:50 - i didn't know what user story was i
28:52 - didn't know what any of that stuff was i
28:53 - just kind of started
28:54 - asking what their requirements were and
28:56 - i just built them a system and the guys
28:58 - and that was the first time i realized
28:59 - like i kind of the way i looked it was i
29:02 - was like
29:02 - i've seen this done before like i've
29:04 - seen websites that do the similar things
29:06 - so i know it's possible
29:07 - so how do i get there and i just kept
29:09 - going with that and every time i wanted
29:10 - to do something i was like
29:11 - i know you can push data into a database
29:13 - i've seen it happen before but how do i
29:15 - get there
29:16 - and i just kept doing that before you
29:17 - know i had a full build and uh
29:20 - and yes that took a lot of frustration
29:22 - and several
29:23 - million hours that they had to compete
29:26 - but that got my journey started and then
29:28 - yeah like i just pretty much from that
29:30 - point on
29:31 - i did go to university wow i would say
29:34 - uh you don't need to like guys
29:36 - it's all about practical knowledge and
29:38 - sort of learning that way how about enos
29:41 - first thing actually before i continue
29:42 - with mine actually guys
29:44 - drop some fire in the comments because
29:46 - that was one heck of a story
29:48 - drop some fire in the comments for sunny
29:50 - because that was one heck of a story
29:52 - and especially my i would drop there's
29:55 - i would drop some fire for sunny for
29:58 - you him building making user stories
30:01 - because that shit's good
30:03 - yeah yeah i didn't even know what jesus
30:06 - story was for that man
30:10 - um but yeah like like for me basically
30:14 - i would say it's actually a very
30:14 - interesting story as well like i kind of
30:16 - started in high school so i think when i
30:18 - was like 16 years old 16 years old
30:20 - and and i started in high school right
30:22 - and
30:24 - and we had in high school we had one web
30:27 - design course so this is at the time i
30:28 - was still figuring out who who was gonna
30:30 - be like what i wanted to learn
30:31 - yeah and we had only one web design
30:33 - course this is a course that we use
30:34 - for dreamers so we use dreamweaver we
30:36 - are in this course yeah and we built
30:38 - some very basic html sites
30:41 - okay so i took the course initially
30:43 - enough i
30:44 - loved that course so much i just i love
30:46 - this idea of like
30:48 - you know taking this thing in your mind
30:50 - and this idea that you have like an idea
30:51 - in your mind and actually putting it to
30:53 - good use
30:54 - yeah like that was like blown
30:57 - like that blew my mind yeah you know
31:00 - like
31:00 - like yeah so like i love that part and i
31:03 - just kept doing it i kept doing i can't
31:04 - building size capability size with
31:06 - gmover
31:07 - i remember like this this course that i
31:09 - had this one course
31:10 - you're only allowed to take this course
31:12 - only once
31:13 - like only one semester yeah and that's
31:16 - it
31:17 - i'm like but i want to take more i want
31:20 - to do more
31:21 - so i literally i kept asking my teacher
31:23 - like what can i do what can i do
31:25 - can i retake this course again again
31:27 - again yeah and guess what
31:29 - yeah i can't retake it i kept retaking
31:31 - the exact same course
31:33 - every single semester
31:37 - for two straight years i just can't
31:38 - retake
31:40 - exactly the same because i wanted to at
31:42 - least be in this right
31:43 - i didn't want to just stop i literally
31:46 - want to be in this
31:47 - and i just kept retaking i kept retaking
31:49 - and basically the next thing you know
31:50 - next thing you know basically what i end
31:52 - up doing is like um
31:54 - and they initially enough i got to a
31:56 - point where like they didn't have any
31:57 - seats for me
31:58 - because i could not register for the
31:59 - course i had to register manually
32:01 - yeah and so what i ended up doing is i
32:03 - ended up buying myself a laptop
32:05 - yeah and they they had like a storage as
32:09 - like a locker room like a storage room
32:11 - right
32:12 - on the side and that's actually where i
32:15 - will learn so i will basically the
32:16 - beginning of the class i'll go into the
32:18 - storage room
32:18 - yeah i'll bring up my laptop and i would
32:20 - actually work and study from that laptop
32:22 - in the storage room
32:23 - really dude they we need to make a film
32:26 - about you that's
32:27 - that's crazy man holy crap
32:30 - yeah yeah so so and literally and like
32:33 - basically what i end up doing is like i
32:34 - end up helping helping the teacher i was
32:35 - the two teachers assistant
32:37 - you know building more websites and then
32:39 - final year
32:40 - my senior year and in high school guys
32:43 - my senior year in high school
32:44 - i decided to make to rebuild the
32:47 - school's website like the whole high
32:48 - school website i decided to rebuild it
32:50 - for fun
32:51 - like i didn't even tell my teacher i
32:53 - didn't even tell my teacher
32:54 - i just literally came in one day i'm
32:55 - like yeah so yeah i built the school's
32:58 - website you know i wanted to see how it
32:59 - looked like she's like
33:01 - what you did what
33:04 - what she loved it like she loved it
33:07 - and it got to a point where like
33:09 - basically i ended up basically
33:10 - working with another student and we made
33:12 - that site mobile friendly
33:14 - and together we rebuilt the whole
33:17 - school's website and that site was
33:19 - on the school's website for three years
33:21 - straight man damn bro oh
33:23 - we actually went up holy crap that's

35:00 - guys maybe maybe there's a face mask you
35:02 - know yeah i mean how did who knows right
35:05 - yeah you read everywhere let's have a
35:07 - look any more comments
35:09 - oh man this is good guys love the
35:11 - comments love it love your uh
35:13 - i love the fire they give you guys they
35:14 - gave you so much fun i love the fire
35:16 - yeah i love seeing that honestly
35:20 - i didn't know pascal was your first
35:21 - language i'm sorry i'm sorry son
35:23 - honestly i know man like i remember
35:26 - writing now i was like
35:27 - even like i can't remember i think like
35:30 - you thought like a semicolon was strict
35:32 - if you code in pascal
35:33 - like that is unforgiving and i i've
35:36 - coded in c
35:36 - plus plus and and like yeah i mean oh to
35:38 - be fair c
35:39 - plus is uh that's a that's an
35:42 - interesting language if anyone
35:44 - if any of you guys have coded in c plus
35:46 - plus let me know in the comments because
35:48 - that's uh that's a tricky language to
35:50 - get your head around yeah
35:53 - yeah no no no no that's one of those
35:57 - ones that you use it to get like uh i
35:59 - made this little embed little
36:00 - you know circuit boards i coded yeah of
36:03 - course the c
36:04 - plus plus on it right and it had like a
36:05 - motion sensor attached to it really
36:08 - and then when you walk in the room it
36:09 - just triggers a motion sensor
36:11 - and then through that little circuit
36:12 - board it's connected to the internet and
36:14 - it pings off a message
36:16 - to like something called a it's called
36:18 - an mqtt server right
36:20 - and then you just have it i had a little
36:22 - raspberry pi running python which you're
36:23 - just listening
36:24 - and then if it started listening it
36:26 - turned on the webcam and it started
36:27 - recording the room
36:29 - really so it's like basically like a
36:30 - live camera yeah yeah and i have the
36:32 - whole
36:34 - security camera yeah i had the whole
36:36 - thing required
36:38 - i won't do it now because on youtube but
36:40 - it's on a private youtube link so
36:42 - i send that to you afterwards it's crazy
36:45 - yeah really do it i want to see that i
36:48 - want to see that man
36:49 - yeah it was a university assignment so
36:51 - i'm definitely i look a bit
36:52 - different but it's a funny thing
36:56 - nice actually what if you can show it to
36:59 - everybody
36:59 - maybe drop the link for everybody to see
37:01 - yeah yeah i can drop that thing
37:12 - a video from like a few years ago to be
37:15 - fair i look very similar to how i
37:17 - i know a little bit slimmer in the face
37:23 - oh man so that's that's actually a
37:25 - really good question what should i be
37:26 - what should i um what should be my
37:29 - approach to become a full stack
37:31 - developer and a good competitive
37:32 - programmer i like that that's a good
37:34 - question
37:35 - yep so what should be on my approach to
37:37 - become a full-stack developer
37:38 - and a good competitive programmer um now
37:41 - do you got any insight for that
37:44 - um yeah i got an answer you wanna start
37:46 - this out
37:47 - start this out yeah so okay so for me a
37:49 - full stack developer so
37:50 - initially when i went into my first row
37:53 - i wasn't prepared to be honest
37:55 - for a full stack row i was more prepared
37:57 - for like i had done a bunch of back end
37:59 - developments so i was actually really
38:00 - weak on the front end
38:02 - so my background was java so i actually
38:04 - did a lot of stuff in java
38:06 - um but then they required full stack
38:08 - they required like you'd know java and
38:10 - you knew javascript and things like that
38:12 - and guys just if you get confused front
38:13 - end is what you're seeing on the website
38:15 - back end is what you typically have on
38:17 - the um
38:18 - on the sort of server stuff and um
38:21 - what i would recommend is just keep your
38:23 - like keep that mindset open at all times
38:26 - but what's really nice now guys is that
38:28 - if you learn something like javascript
38:30 - right
38:30 - you can use it for the front end and for
38:32 - the back end which is really cool
38:34 - right so like that full stacks problem
38:37 - that we used to face as to like
38:39 - oh i can use like web dev i can do like
38:41 - html css and javascript from the front
38:43 - end but my java is super weak
38:44 - that problems kind of got a little bit
38:46 - lifted now because you can code in
38:48 - javascript
38:49 - you have no js now for the back end um
38:52 - so you can
38:52 - transfer that knowledge and then while
38:54 - you're building your front end and
38:56 - you're sort of
38:56 - building your javascript skill set that
38:59 - can be transferred to the back end and
39:00 - then
39:01 - you vice versa like so you can sort of
39:03 - alleviate that now so what i would say
39:04 - is my approach here would be
39:06 - pick and stick with one language like we
39:08 - said earlier so
39:09 - in this case i would pick javascript and
39:12 - just
39:12 - really harness your skill set on that
39:15 - because you can actually become a really
39:16 - good full stack developer
39:18 - just with javascript yeah yeah
39:21 - sure that how about you know that
39:25 - yeah i would say i would say like the
39:27 - role path like the road map to kind of
39:28 - like becoming a full stack developer is
39:30 - that
39:30 - obviously guys right in the full stack
39:32 - developer what do you have
39:34 - you have the front end right which is
39:36 - what you see on the website that's the
39:37 - front
39:37 - guys and then you have the back end that
39:40 - is where the server
39:41 - logic be that's where all the server
39:43 - logic is so if you think of facebook
39:44 - okay i think of facebook facebook what
39:47 - has the front-end application that's
39:49 - what you see the back-end logic is
39:52 - where all your information is stored it
39:54 - is basically
39:55 - you know how you get information you
39:57 - know that's how basically your front end
39:59 - shows all the data you know shows the
40:00 - news feed it shows your pictures right
40:02 - it is because all of that and all the
40:04 - logic is actually saved on the server on
40:05 - the back inside and the backend api
40:08 - and if you want to learn basically both
40:11 - the front end and the backing which i
40:12 - highly recommend because both of us are
40:13 - full stack developers
40:14 - and it's actually very valuable
40:16 - knowledge uh to have and
40:18 - actually has got me you know a lot of
40:20 - great opportunities
40:21 - is like if you let's say if you're doing
40:24 - javascript okay
40:25 - if you're doing javascript okay and
40:27 - you're learning how to do frontend and
40:29 - you're learning for example react
40:30 - now try you do a node.js which by the
40:33 - way actually something we teach
40:34 - in profit or javascript we teach you
40:36 - guys how to become a full stack
40:37 - developer we teach you guys how to build
40:39 - apis
40:40 - using node.js okay so first you want to
40:43 - learn for example react to frontend and
40:44 - then you want to couple that with a
40:46 - backend
40:47 - which is for example like node.js and
40:49 - build apis with that
40:50 - so those are two parts if you want to go
40:52 - the route now
40:54 - another route you can go is you can be i
40:56 - can build reactor yes
40:58 - but i can also go the jingle route and
41:00 - actually build my back end with
41:02 - django okay with django as a back-end
41:05 - api
41:06 - now i would highly recommend for you
41:09 - just to make it simpler
41:10 - start do node.js okay build your backup
41:13 - with node.js if that if you started out
41:15 - with
41:16 - javascript if you start out with
41:17 - javascript i'd highly recommend
41:19 - try on node.js like literally guys so
41:21 - many companies use that you have no idea
41:23 - honestly one great example is netflix i
41:25 - don't know if you know
41:26 - but netflix actually actually used
41:28 - node.js for the whole backend api system
41:31 - oh nice all of their logic all their
41:33 - logic is built
41:34 - in node.js which is really cool awesome
41:37 - so
41:38 - exactly so hold on i just yeah so i
41:40 - literally was looking i was
41:41 - looking at that and i found it out i'm
41:42 - like holy [ __ ] that's cool you know nice
41:44 - but but yeah but like like if you're
41:47 - doing javascript
41:48 - you know learn javascript learn front
41:50 - end and then you know build the back end
41:52 - and then once you've got those two parts
41:55 - my friend
41:56 - you are sailing exactly you are sailing
42:00 - and that's pretty much it like you know
42:01 - there's not much more to it yes
42:03 - you just you you just there's not much
42:05 - to it you have to know both parts and
42:06 - that's it
42:07 - yeah and the more projects now you the
42:09 - more projects you now do with those bold
42:11 - parts the more experience you get with
42:12 - that
42:12 - like in profit the javascript for
42:14 - example we teach you how to build a blog
42:17 - with a front end and a back and use
42:19 - node.js we teach you how to
42:21 - a google maps store locator with a front
42:23 - end and a back end
42:24 - we teach you how to build a twitter
42:26 - clone with a front end and a back end
42:28 - we teach you how to also make how to
42:30 - also make a chrome extension with a
42:32 - front-end and a back-end so
42:34 - you can see a lot of the repetitiveness
42:36 - of front-end
42:37 - and the back-end which gets to full
42:39 - stack development
42:41 - yeah so yeah drop in the comments below
42:43 - who wants to become a full stock
42:44 - developer because i know you guys are
42:46 - who wants to come to the post a

44:04 - yeah
44:04 - nice yeah so um
44:07 - i actually i just saw a really good
44:09 - question but i've completely
44:11 - lost that uh if it comes back got some
44:13 - good questions we got some good
44:14 - questions out here man oh
44:16 - that's it right so nars actually just
44:18 - mentioned guys about
44:19 - netflix right and how netflix use uh uh
44:22 - node.js for the backend
44:23 - uh if you guys are always wondering and
44:25 - you've got like some kind of curiosity
44:26 - it's like
44:27 - how do you build netflix like the front
44:29 - end how do you build the back end
44:30 - guys we actually did that we did that i
44:32 - think it was like a few days ago oh yeah
44:34 - and uh so if you're going you can go
44:36 - ahead and right now you can go check out
44:38 - this link right here
44:39 - so um if you literally pause the video
44:41 - here if you go to this link
44:43 - right there at the top of the screen you
44:44 - can actually go ahead and see this and
44:46 - this is live and this is something we
44:47 - built
44:48 - and guys it's a complete fully
44:50 - functional working netflix app
44:52 - so we built this and this is built in
44:53 - react um so like just to go to show you
44:56 - sort of what you can build
44:58 - by harnessing and yeah like you can do
45:00 - all of this and
45:01 - guys like we said like this front end
45:03 - was built with react
45:05 - but the back end is also like you can
45:07 - have the whole backing powered in
45:08 - node.js
45:09 - so really really powerful stuff by just
45:11 - harnessing your skill set on on
45:13 - javascript
45:13 - he was telling us he was watching
45:14 - netflix with amberly the other day
45:17 - and he uh funny story happened so he was
45:20 - watching it
45:21 - and he had the netflix clone open on the
45:23 - right and the actual
45:25 - netflix opened on the left and he kept
45:26 - clicking it wondering why it wasn't
45:28 - opening the film
45:30 - and he was like oh my god i'm on the
45:32 - netflix club
45:33 - so uh i know the story so when you get
45:35 - those kind of problems you know you
45:36 - built a decent website
45:39 - that's good that is good stuff man oh my
45:41 - gosh
45:43 - that is good stuff awesome um
45:47 - right so best platform for mobile apps
45:49 - guys it's really good question here
45:51 - uh we can actually mention something
45:53 - here called react native so if you do
45:55 - let him react guys
45:57 - you can actually transfer all of that
45:59 - skill all of those skills over
46:00 - to something called react native which
46:02 - is whereby you pretty much code the same
46:04 - code base so you have react
46:07 - but it basically compiles so your code
46:10 - one code base
46:11 - gets like translated into two different
46:13 - co code sets so you've got
46:14 - like ios and an android app from one
46:17 - codebase which is really nice and i've
46:18 - coded in that before
46:20 - uh and actually interesting story so my
46:22 - first job that i went to
46:23 - i knew react i was in i barely knew
46:26 - react i kind of just got in there
46:28 - and they sort of learned on the fly but
46:30 - i had no exposure to react native but
46:32 - because i knew react you can pretty much
46:34 - pick up react native really quickly
46:36 - um so yeah so that if that was an answer
46:38 - to your question it's a really
46:40 - really nice way of doing it yeah
46:44 - um cool go ahead and see
46:47 - is it necessary is it necessary to learn
46:52 - javascript for web programming or
46:54 - learning django
46:55 - is enough uh
46:58 - what is that question uh
47:01 - let's see avinash avinash asked the
47:04 - question
47:06 - do you see it
47:10 - yeah oh yeah yeah there we go you got it
47:13 - okay
47:15 - so it isn't necessary to learn
47:17 - javascript
47:18 - for web programming or learning django
47:20 - is enough
47:22 - um what would you say to that sunny so
47:25 - personally i don't actually know django
47:28 - so i have not coded in django before um
47:31 - i've done
47:32 - i've done python work so i've done a lot
47:34 - of python coding um but not actually
47:36 - touched on django so not at all
47:38 - um is it like my my answer to this would
47:41 - be
47:42 - if you want to go into web development i
47:44 - would really recommend that yes you
47:46 - would probably need to know javascript
47:48 - because it's the
47:49 - main language around the web development
47:50 - space um
47:52 - and and like the whole sort of market
47:55 - share is going towards
47:57 - like sort of react right now as the most
48:00 - wanted
48:01 - library right now guys uh and it's
48:03 - powered
48:04 - by javascript um so i would really
48:07 - recommend
48:08 - it's not really a case of is it
48:10 - necessary it's kind of
48:11 - the whatever the market goes towards so
48:14 - if like react is popular now
48:16 - and then like let's say in a year's time
48:17 - or in two years time something else
48:19 - becomes popular
48:20 - like it probably will be based around
48:22 - javascript
48:23 - because javascript is getting more and
48:25 - more powerful um so i would recommend uh
48:28 - an answer to this pretty simply yes i
48:30 - would recommend that you do learn
48:31 - javascript
48:32 - um and if you currently know django then
48:35 - really cool like
48:36 - uh that's really really like it will
48:38 - actually give you a head start if
48:39 - anything because you're
