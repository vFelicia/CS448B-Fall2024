00:02 - okay
00:03 - pause no yo what's up guys i recently
00:08 - did a reaction video
00:10 - and you guys really seem to enjoy it so
00:12 - this is real developer
00:14 - reacting to tv shows about coding or
00:17 - development is there a bunch of
00:18 - [ __ ] in there we're going to find out
00:20 - together so let's just roll right into
00:22 - our first clip we have a tv show called
00:24 - scorpion where a genius
00:26 - forms a group of super geniuses where
00:29 - they defend against threats
00:30 - to the modern world so let's go and
00:32 - check that show out
00:37 - okay pause no
00:40 - no developer has ever done this
00:44 - nor will they but i'm hooked so let's
00:47 - [ __ ] see what this developer is up to
00:53 - no you know
00:56 - no no this is not [ __ ] happening
00:59 - right now
01:00 - this is not happening no developer has
01:03 - ever done this
01:04 - no developer will ever do this they're
01:06 - not involved
01:07 - in car chases bank i mean you can have
01:09 - developers in bank robberies i'm sure
01:11 - this is not happening where somebody's
01:13 - on a [ __ ] plane you're pulling a
01:15 - [ __ ]
01:15 - their g string or whatever this freaking
01:17 - string thing is and you're connecting it
01:19 - to your computer and writing code
01:21 - i mean i don't know what's going on it's
01:22 - really over the top sometimes i really
01:24 - like [ __ ] that's over the top i'm not
01:25 - gonna completely pass up on it
01:27 - this is not a day in the life of your
01:29 - average developer at least let's just
01:30 - say that let's go
01:37 - so i see a lamborghini i see a samsung
01:40 - laptop and i see a plane going off she
01:43 - was getting up
01:44 - to like not disconnect i don't really
01:47 - understand what she's trying to
01:48 - hack if she had an apple computer he
01:51 - could have just airdropped it to her so
01:52 - i think
01:53 - apple should have [ __ ] sponsored this
01:55 - video instead of samsung and this would
01:56 - have been a much better scene
01:58 - i like how the dude is just so chill
01:59 - like look at the dude's face driving
02:00 - he's just [ __ ] like just straight up
02:02 - chill
02:02 - developers definitely are not doing that
02:05 - on the regular
02:06 - though we want to feel like we are i
02:09 - think in our heads
02:10 - we feel like we're doing stuff that's
02:12 - like very
02:13 - high intensity but it's not you know a
02:15 - lot of developers
02:17 - don't like pressure most developers are
02:19 - very introverted
02:21 - don't like to like have confrontations
02:22 - don't like to have a lot of pressure
02:24 - and don't often perform well under
02:26 - pressure which is why
02:27 - in most coding interviews most
02:29 - developers just like
02:30 - crack right because most coding
02:32 - interviews will have them
02:34 - write up an algorithm or a solution live
02:36 - it's a nerve wracking experience for
02:38 - them
02:38 - you know they try to avoid that most of
02:40 - their jobs and most of the times you're
02:42 - doing a very calm
02:44 - relaxing job very rarely you're driving
02:47 - around in a lamborghini
02:48 - trying to coat something that a security
02:50 - guard is like passing you from
02:52 - the edge of the airplane but you know if
02:54 - you're into that type of thing that
02:56 - could be
02:56 - a lot of fun this scene was really
02:58 - entertaining to watch
02:59 - how realistic is it to a developer
03:02 - scenario
03:04 - zero out of ten now this clip that we're
03:06 - gonna see
03:07 - it's from a show called it crowd this is
03:09 - a british show where there's a bunch of
03:11 - i.t
03:12 - people in in the office and they work
03:14 - together and it is a comedy show
03:18 - you know i mean for for example moss
03:21 - you could take me through what you're
03:22 - doing right now i'd be delighted
03:24 - oh wait hold on pause okay so random
03:28 - but i see this one gif all the time
03:31 - anytime i go to jiffy and i see the
03:33 - meme and there's like a dude with the
03:34 - laptop and like flames coming out of it
03:36 - i think it's this dude
03:37 - i actually think it's this dude i could
03:39 - be wrong
03:40 - but like holy [ __ ] i feel like my life
03:42 - just found meaning i was so confused
03:44 - every time i would see it seems like
03:45 - what is this so that's really cool so
03:47 - it's from it crowd okay let's keep going
03:48 - i'm just working on a very simple piece
03:50 - of programming code
04:00 - i see oh god no i'm lying again i didn't
04:04 - understand any of that i don't know
04:05 - anything about computers i mean
04:07 - i'm absolutely useless to you i might as
04:09 - well pack up and go
04:10 - her what just happened i didn't get it
04:13 - oh
04:14 - [Laughter]
04:16 - okay so my real reaction is that that
04:19 - part you know the show could be really
04:21 - good
04:21 - i mean i didn't really it was weird it
04:23 - didn't really mean anything to me
04:24 - but what it seems like if i had to like
04:27 - really reach and decipher it is when
04:29 - somebody hears you talk about coding
04:31 - it's very confusing for them so i can
04:33 - attest to that a little bit when i'm
04:35 - explaining it to my girlfriend whoever
04:36 - they do seem a little bit confused by it
04:39 - so that part i understand
04:40 - but based on that clip i'm gonna give
04:42 - that show a three out of ten
04:44 - even though that probably doesn't do
04:45 - that show justice okay so i'm sorry for
04:47 - those of you who are gonna be upset in
04:48 - the comments i know i should really
04:50 - watch that show and i'm sure it's gonna
04:51 - be great but i'm just basing it off of
04:53 - what i saw
04:54 - next up we have chuck and this is about
04:56 - a computer geek that downloads
04:58 - government secrets
04:59 - straight into this [ __ ] dome so let's
05:01 - go ahead and check it out
05:08 - okay wow wow i mean
05:11 - i don't know what the hell this was we
05:13 - just watched like
05:14 - like this is not fast in the future this
05:16 - is like a fast and furious version of
05:18 - developers i mean i would love to meet
05:20 - where these developers are maybe i just
05:21 - have never ran into them but like these
05:24 - guys are opening up like hundreds of
05:26 - terminals and i don't know how their
05:27 - terminal and their command lines are
05:29 - already like running
05:30 - so like what are they opening they have
05:33 - some code on the left hand side which
05:35 - looks like it's creating a file and then
05:38 - it just basically closes that file so
05:40 - it's like [ __ ] code
05:41 - and like literally all the code does
05:45 - is it just opens a file and just closes
05:46 - the file that's really it
05:48 - this guy is doing something really
05:49 - similar i think i don't really see much
05:52 - happening there
05:53 - and then he just has a screen that's
05:54 - like generating keys which again i don't
05:57 - know why they're generating so many keys
05:59 - all at the same time
06:00 - and opening up so many screens most of
06:02 - the times as a developer you're not
06:03 - necessarily opening up so many screens
06:05 - so fast
06:06 - but again if there was a dude with a gun
06:07 - in his hand i might be opening up a lot
06:09 - more screens on them
06:10 - in that same amount of time and your
06:12 - screens most of the times when you open
06:14 - these command lines they don't make that
06:15 - weird sound
06:17 - like that weird sound number sound no
06:19 - developer's
06:20 - computer makes those sounds if you are a
06:22 - developer that does that
06:23 - drop it in the comments below i'd love
06:25 - to check out your setup but so far i
06:27 - have not met anybody like that
06:29 - fun scene to watch in terms of it
06:32 - mapping to reality
06:33 - with a potential boss with a gun in his
06:36 - hand
06:36 - with a bunch of people cooling and
06:39 - hollering around you
06:40 - as you code under time pressure
06:42 - otherwise you're gonna get shot
06:43 - doesn't really map that much to reality
06:45 - so i'm gonna give that 3 out of 10 on
06:47 - the developer scale but it was cool that
06:49 - this showed at least
06:50 - some type of code so actually let's move
06:52 - it up to a 5 on the developer
06:54 - scale this clip is actually from a tv
06:57 - show called
06:57 - csi cyber where there's a dude who's
07:00 - helping the fbi
07:01 - find out about malicious activity let's
07:03 - just play it and
07:04 - see what happens html injection check it
07:06 - out someone hacked a curtain ad on the
07:09 - scroll md site
07:10 - looks like a normal ad right this is the
07:12 - code for the ad peekaboo
07:14 - there's actually two codes written right
07:16 - on top of each other all right so
07:18 - in coding and in development you never
07:21 - have like these
07:22 - 3d screens that just pop out of no
07:24 - [ __ ] where and then you have like
07:25 - code in front of it and code behind it
07:27 - that never happens you're
07:28 - actually on really boring command lines
07:31 - or
07:32 - vs code or you know sublime text or
07:35 - whatever is the text editor of your
07:36 - choice
07:37 - that's usually what you're using and
07:39 - that's usually what you would show
07:40 - something on
07:41 - not necessarily a 3d thing pops up and
07:43 - stuff happens now
07:44 - the part where he's talking about html
07:46 - injection those are
07:47 - very real things and there's a lot of
07:50 - danger to those types of injections so
07:52 - what's happening here
07:53 - is there is an ad when you click that ad
07:55 - you think you're going to buy
07:56 - shoes but a hacker when you click that
07:58 - ad there's code behind it where you
08:00 - click and it takes you to a completely
08:02 - different website that might not be shoe
08:04 - related or
08:04 - it might look like that shoe website but
08:06 - it really is just trying to steal your
08:08 - information and it's not taking you to
08:09 - like nike.com it might be taking you to
08:12 - nikes.com and you just don't realize it
08:14 - now you put in your credit card you buy
08:16 - the thing you just gave them all your
08:17 - information sometimes it's also known as
08:19 - a phishing attack
08:20 - okay p-h-i-s-h-i-n-g
08:23 - where you get taken to a wrong domain
08:26 - that's what kind of might be happening
08:27 - here
08:28 - let's mix all the machines with ip
08:30 - addresses associated with big
08:31 - corporations
08:32 - executive assistants and guys in the
08:34 - mail room probably aren't counterfeit
08:35 - drug lords
08:37 - 218 gone okay so
08:41 - that was cool and he's like okay let's
08:43 - find all the ip addresses associated
08:45 - with this thing but like no developer
08:47 - ever is working under that much like
08:49 - time
08:49 - stress and has like 20 people it's like
08:51 - what's happening right now usually it's
08:53 - a lot more boring
08:54 - somebody's going to give you a task you
08:55 - go to your freaking office and you're
08:57 - just sitting there
08:58 - for hours you're bored out of your
08:59 - freaking mind and you're just like
09:01 - coding trying to come up with a solution
09:02 - you don't have 20 [ __ ] inspectors
09:04 - standing there like
09:05 - boom give me something right now i'm
09:07 - gonna that doesn't happen again
09:08 - also he's like getting the ip addresses
09:10 - and then there's like some 3d
09:12 - [ __ ] happening like what is that like
09:14 - where is this 3d stuff coming from
09:16 - do these guys have like a dedicated
09:18 - graphic designer that works with them so
09:19 - whatever code this guy writes he like
09:21 - shows it in this 3d way
09:23 - it's much more boring than this it's not
09:25 - as exciting um
09:26 - as that plate unbeatable the cameras all
09:29 - four tires give out bluetooth signals
09:30 - for poor when you're low on pressure
09:32 - what are you thinking
09:33 - it's got a little white box right there
09:34 - picks up bluetooth signals report
09:35 - traffic
09:36 - oh [ __ ] okay that was pretty dope like
09:38 - bluetooth technology does
09:40 - pick up things like that i'm not an
09:42 - expert in bluetooth technology
09:44 - but it is pretty cool that they're using
09:46 - bluetooth technology to figure stuff out
09:48 - if you are a developer or you're a
09:50 - hacker and you know how to do those
09:52 - things
09:53 - you can tap into that information from
09:55 - people although in reality the security
09:57 - is going to be much more strict and now
09:59 - the security is a lot better with these
10:00 - things so it's much harder to
10:02 - get to that so csi cyber it's cool
10:06 - it's flashy but in terms of how it maps
10:08 - like real life
10:10 - i think i'm gonna give it like a six out
10:12 - of ten for
10:13 - uh developer scene the next scene we
10:15 - have is from a famous show
10:17 - called silicon valley it's a funny show
10:19 - about these people
10:20 - doing a startup so let's go ahead and
10:22 - check the scene out
10:23 - that's weird they always travel in
10:27 - groups of five
10:28 - these programmers there's always a tall
10:30 - skinny white guy
10:32 - short skinny asian guy fat guy with a
10:35 - ponytail
10:36 - a lot of developers that hang out are
10:38 - often times like an
10:39 - odd bunch and there's a reason why
10:41 - programming has a stigma around it even
10:44 - though there are a lot of developers
10:45 - that are like
10:46 - not very stereotypical but a lot of them
10:48 - you know like
10:49 - even right now me my [ __ ] up like my
10:51 - weird beard
10:52 - hairs everywhere i mean that should tell
10:54 - you that i'm a real developer
10:55 - and it's because oftentimes we're
10:57 - thinking about code we're thinking about
10:58 - building apps and that stuff doesn't
11:00 - live in the real world so our head is
11:02 - not in the real world a lot of times
11:03 - sin what is possible what could we
11:06 - create and so often times you get people
11:07 - like steve jobs and mark zuckerberg who
11:09 - have one shirt and they just keep
11:11 - wearing that same color again and again
11:13 - and again so enough to use
11:14 - brain processing power on a mundane task
11:16 - and they can just stay focused
11:18 - on what they're doing which is building
11:19 - these really fascinating things
11:21 - this is funny i mean even the high
11:22 - school i went to i saw groups of
11:24 - four and fives like that you know so
11:27 - it's kind of funny let's keep watching
11:28 - and then an east indian guy
11:32 - it's like they trade guys until they all
11:34 - have the right group
11:36 - i like that it does seem like they trade
11:38 - people until they have the right group
11:40 - so
11:40 - i mean in terms of the groupings and how
11:43 - it is i mean yeah taking that aside i
11:45 - have seen really cool developers fun
11:47 - developers there's a lot of like random
11:49 - stigma around it too
11:50 - and movies and shows paint a picture
11:54 - but honestly in real life really anybody
11:56 - can be a developer the person you're
11:58 - sitting next to
12:00 - might be a developer so you never really
12:02 - know there are a lot of times these
12:03 - stigmas and stereotypes get developed
12:04 - and you think developers look like a
12:06 - specific type of person or they are
12:08 - we really have to break out of them and
12:10 - make development freaking cool again
12:12 - because
12:12 - people have turned it into this thing
12:14 - that only like weird people do this
12:16 - right
12:16 - but if you started to know tons of
12:18 - developers there are a lot of developers
12:20 - who are just like
12:20 - really cool normal people because of
12:23 - movies we stereotype them as like
12:25 - weird fat guy that sits behind the
12:27 - [ __ ] computer and just like
12:28 - uh and just like eating chips or
12:30 - something and then just types really
12:32 - fast
12:32 - that's really not how it is most of the
12:34 - times that clip not the show itself but
12:36 - i think that scene i'll give it like
12:39 - um six out of ten you know
12:42 - mr robot brilliant cyber security
12:45 - engineer and he tries to take down a
12:48 - corrupt corporation so let's watch a
12:51 - clip from mr robot
12:52 - and i actually really like this show
12:54 - g-u-r
12:55 - so some kind of like cryptic algorithm
12:59 - you can see in here so oftentimes as
13:01 - developers
13:02 - even though i'm not in cyber security
13:04 - but when you're solving
13:05 - tons of algorithms as developers you
13:07 - solve lots of problems where something's
13:08 - like a palindrome and you try to find
13:10 - hey what's the reverse
13:12 - palindromes are like words that are
13:13 - reversed so for example like a race car
13:15 - spelled backwards is also just a race
13:18 - car whoa what yeah try
13:19 - spelling that backwards this is
13:20 - something happening with like text based
13:23 - cryptic thing let's see what hap
13:26 - what what well what they're gonna do
13:28 - here shift value of 13.
13:30 - it's a route 13 algorithm the parent
13:34 - pages will help you find your
13:37 - calling but don't be duped
13:41 - cut down the woods each letter is
13:44 - actually shifted by 13. if you do that
13:46 - you'll get to those letters at the
13:47 - bottom the parent pages will help you
13:50 - so what he did is he just took it into a
13:52 - rot 13 encryption which essentially
13:55 - shifts each letter by 13 and does it now
13:57 - in reality if somebody's doing
13:59 - encryption
14:00 - they're probably not going to be doing a
14:01 - basic encryption of like 13.
14:04 - if they're good they're going to be
14:05 - doing an encryption that's much harder
14:07 - to crack
14:08 - but still pretty pretty cool but like as
14:11 - developers a lot of these algorithms you
14:12 - sit down and you
14:13 - you do do them and you can solve them
14:16 - hairdos
14:17 - [Music]
14:19 - we have some type of formula here a
14:21 - function
14:22 - and we put an n in here and it gives us
14:25 - back
14:28 - something
14:33 - okay so did shift the number by 13 and
14:35 - then they go and put it
14:37 - inside of the formula that they found
14:40 - and they're getting the numbers
14:41 - okay cool as a developer this is not
14:44 - most of the time of your job
14:45 - this is for cyber security for
14:47 - developers we build [ __ ]
14:48 - we don't hack a lot of the times but for
14:51 - cyber security people
14:52 - they do have to encrypt and decrypt
14:56 - codes and see what they can find it's a
14:58 - phone number
15:00 - oh [ __ ] so that's cool and then the last
15:02 - step is to take it and put it as a
15:03 - hexadecimal now i don't exactly know
15:06 - what made them choose hexadecimal
15:07 - instead of binary or all the other
15:09 - options that they had available maybe
15:11 - they just had
15:12 - instinct and they're into the cyber
15:13 - security world but they took that
15:15 - message kept encrypting it
15:16 - now what i do like about this is it's
15:19 - real and you can actually follow it
15:20 - along
15:21 - it seems like there's validity to this
15:23 - so i like when things are
15:25 - valid that's really cool unlike freaking
15:27 - queen's gambit where she's just
15:28 - looking at the ceiling and learning
15:30 - chess that's not how you learn chess
15:31 - like i went over to a hundred
15:33 - tournaments in actual real life and
15:35 - played chess that's not how i got better
15:37 - by ever looking at the freaking ceiling
15:38 - so here there's real validity
15:40 - to the way they did this it was a cool
15:41 - scene to watch not
15:43 - totally like developer related but cyber
15:46 - security related so i'm just going to
15:47 - give it like a
15:49 - 7.5 out of 10. now let's get into a show
15:52 - called person of interest which actually
15:55 - reading its synopsis i would be excited
15:56 - to watch but this show
15:58 - is about an xcia guy who uses artificial
16:01 - intelligence
16:02 - to find criminals i think that is super
16:04 - cool and as
16:05 - a aficionado and somebody who enjoys
16:07 - machine learning which is you know
16:08 - basically face detection
16:10 - image detection all of that kind of fun
16:12 - stuff they're using
16:13 - that to automatically detect people who
16:15 - could be criminals that sounds like a
16:16 - really cool premise to me
16:18 - let's watch the show now holy [ __ ]
16:21 - no okay kevin spacey
16:26 - excellent next question who am i
16:29 - oh very good damn admin now let's begin
16:32 - i'm testing the core code the higher
16:34 - function pause all right so far that's
16:37 - really freaking cool this makes me happy
16:39 - like if i saw that and i was watching a
16:40 - show
16:41 - i'd genuinely be excited and i would get
16:43 - lit because it looks
16:45 - real like this looks real first of all
16:47 - how the face detection started
16:49 - you can actually check out one of our
16:50 - coding tutorials called the python ai
16:52 - tutorial
16:53 - right up here and in that one that's
16:56 - actually
16:56 - literally what we do we teach people how
16:59 - to detect
17:00 - facial images based on camera so like
17:02 - you could show the camera an orange
17:04 - and it could detect it and we use a
17:06 - programming language called python to do
17:08 - that machine learning
17:09 - when he's doing that thing at the start
17:10 - where it says admin right on his face
17:13 - that's really what he's doing he's
17:14 - teaching his computer how to detect
17:16 - faces how to detect objects
17:18 - and how to log him in now he switches
17:20 - over to code
17:21 - he's probably using c or c plus plus or
17:24 - something i can't
17:25 - completely make out on the screen
17:28 - definitely
17:29 - not python because of how the if else
17:32 - statements are
17:33 - so using some lower level language i'm
17:35 - seeing void std call
17:37 - blah blah unassign ins so to me when i
17:40 - look at this as a developer i'm thinking
17:42 - either i'm looking at java or some form
17:44 - of cc plus plus
17:46 - i don't code in those languages all the
17:48 - time i code primarily in python or
17:50 - javascript but once you learn
17:51 - one language it gives you ultimate power
17:53 - it's like knowing how to speak to a
17:54 - genie
17:55 - once you know how to speak to a genie in
17:57 - its own language you unlock
17:59 - unlimited power and then it doesn't
18:00 - matter whether you speak in french
18:02 - whether you speak in english whether you
18:04 - speak in python
18:04 - javascript c plus plus there's just
18:06 - different languages all along you speak
18:08 - to genie so i'm looking at the code i
18:10 - feel like a little bit java now i'm
18:11 - looking at the computer i'm like what
18:12 - the [ __ ] is this but
18:14 - because they set the show in 2001 this
18:16 - makes sense the file system you know as
18:18 - a developer
18:18 - i like that i see code editor at the top
18:20 - i like that i see
18:22 - file systems i like that they're showing
18:24 - real looking code
18:26 - really good i love that they're doing
18:27 - that so let's keep going this show has
18:29 - my respect
18:30 - code the higher functions to ensure that
18:32 - the system we're creating will have the
18:34 - right value set
18:35 - morality in a machine we can't introduce
18:38 - real data
18:39 - until we're sure that the program won't
18:40 - abuse it hmm
18:42 - i really love that the talk about
18:44 - morality of the machine
18:45 - that part is like dope the guy is like
18:47 - hey you're actually talking about the
18:48 - morality of the machine void machine
18:50 - learning you actually can even teach
18:52 - computer morals it's kind of like
18:54 - teaching a dog
18:56 - right i have a english bulldog her name
18:58 - is pudgy she's a huge troublemaker she's
18:59 - adorable she's fat she's stupid
19:01 - i love her to death when she does
19:03 - something bad i go bad pudgy and when
19:05 - she does something great i'm like
19:07 - great job here's a treat here's a treat
19:09 - here's a treat she learns to pee outside
19:11 - and not
19:12 - inside because she knows she's gonna get
19:13 - treats us humans are like that too
19:16 - you can teach computers morality in the
19:18 - same way
19:19 - you reward it for something you wanted
19:21 - to do you punish it for something
19:23 - you don't want it to do okay with
19:25 - machine learning you can teach it to do
19:26 - that you can teach it those behaviors
19:28 - the next thing he talks about is real
19:29 - introducing real data as developers
19:32 - one of the things we get so lazy at but
19:34 - it's the worst thing you can do fellow
19:36 - developers if you're listening pay
19:37 - attention
19:38 - if you are a developer and you don't
19:40 - properly test your code
19:42 - you suck please properly test code
19:45 - and the reason why you don't do that is
19:47 - because it's not your company that you
19:49 - made so
19:50 - you don't really give a [ __ ] and we get
19:52 - lazy
19:53 - i get lazy myself sometimes even when
19:55 - i'm writing code for my own company so
19:57 - sometimes i suck
19:58 - it's really important because if you
20:00 - don't test your data
20:01 - and you just the first time you're
20:03 - testing it is on real live applications
20:05 - you can destroy everything right so for
20:07 - example
20:07 - if i'm making a robin hood like app that
20:10 - can do stock trading for you
20:11 - if i don't test it and i just open it to
20:14 - the public and you can put your credit
20:15 - cards in
20:15 - what if my app has a bug in it that just
20:18 - like it spends
20:19 - all the money that you put into it so if
20:20 - you have a hundred thousand dollars and
20:22 - even if you wanna
20:23 - buy a stock for a hundred bucks it just
20:25 - uses up all hundred thousand
20:27 - that would suck and it does that for
20:29 - everybody so if it has millions of users
20:31 - it'll just do that for all millions of
20:32 - users
20:33 - how could you avoid it you write tests
20:35 - and test your app so it's kind of like
20:37 - you trust the machine you're building by
20:40 - giving it little tasks and then when you
20:42 - can trust it on its own
20:43 - then you give it bigger tasks it's kind
20:44 - of like a relationship or a friend or a
20:46 - boyfriend girlfriend whatever right you
20:48 - get into a relationship
20:49 - you're like let me give this person my
20:51 - you know house keys that one day
20:53 - let's see if they abuse it if they're
20:55 - breaking in 2am in your house like what
20:57 - the [ __ ] first of all i already gave you
20:58 - the keys so why are you breaking in at
21:00 - random times second
21:01 - it's obnoxious and it breaks your trust
21:03 - but if they're like not
21:04 - abusing it and they're trustworthy and
21:06 - they're only there to care for you
21:08 - you're like now i trust them more now we
21:10 - can do more things together that's how
21:12 - it is with your code and how it should
21:13 - be
21:13 - first you give it little tasks and see
21:15 - if it can build trust if it passes those
21:17 - unit tests great
21:18 - now we move the app into what we call
21:20 - production and that's where
21:22 - the whole world can start using it and
21:24 - we move it out of the
21:25 - development environment that's what
21:27 - they're saying let's actually test it
21:28 - first strange
21:30 - did you write this
21:34 - hmm there is a new method at line ten
21:38 - thousand so pause real quick
21:39 - so something really interesting just
21:41 - happened there was a line of code
21:43 - that he actually saw that he didn't
21:45 - actually really write and he asks hey
21:47 - there's this code at this line
21:49 - let's actually see what the computer
21:50 - responds let's hit play
21:52 - are you aware of this additional code
21:56 - can you tell me who added it
22:00 - damn okay so what's crazy is that
22:03 - he didn't actually add that line of code
22:05 - but the computer just said
22:06 - admin added it so what is really going
22:08 - on here that's really weird let's see if
22:10 - they maybe reveal that in a little bit
22:21 - damn that is a [ __ ]
22:24 - sick cliffhanger so this is so cool so
22:27 - he goes something weird just happened
22:29 - and it goes adventure it's like yo i
22:31 - didn't clearly add this
22:32 - and now i actually love that he's about
22:34 - to run a line of code which
22:36 - tests your app and oftentimes as
22:38 - developers we run tests
22:39 - what we call unit tests to test our app
22:42 - and see if there's something broken or
22:43 - not
22:44 - and right as he's about to run it the
22:46 - computer just shuts off
22:48 - i literally almost get goosebumps
22:50 - because what the [ __ ] is going on here
22:51 - what is happening here our editor will
22:53 - check that out don't worry your children
22:54 - can watch this mr kazi is safe to watch
22:56 - come along children let's figure out
22:58 - what happened here
22:59 - so he's trying to do a unit test the app
23:00 - just vanishes and we don't really know
23:02 - what's going on
23:03 - now this is the very very fascinating
23:06 - and
23:06 - existential question that a lot of
23:09 - philosophers and computer scientists
23:11 - think about
23:12 - night and day and that is what happens
23:15 - when you give the machine
23:17 - the ultimate power these machines are so
23:19 - powerful
23:20 - that even something under the hood that
23:21 - most people don't know when you post a
23:23 - picture on facebook
23:24 - under the hood me as a developer i know
23:26 - this i've seen this the machine knows if
23:28 - it's a happy photo or a sad photo
23:30 - it knows if you were overwhelmed and it
23:32 - can actually look at your face and
23:34 - detect
23:34 - fear and it knows even what percentage
23:36 - of fear that is and these machine
23:38 - learning algorithms are only getting
23:39 - better and better and if you don't trust
23:40 - me
23:41 - think about even at a very basic level
23:43 - when you post a photo on facebook it
23:44 - automatically tags you that's using
23:46 - machine learning it's automatically
23:48 - detecting the faces so if you have those
23:50 - machines and they start getting lots and
23:52 - lots of power well think about a machine
23:54 - that's standing right in front of you
23:55 - and you can detect your fear
23:56 - it can detect your heart rate and based
23:58 - on the sweat and knows what you're gonna
23:59 - do next because it can see your past and
24:01 - all the decisions you've made
24:02 - imagine competing against something
24:04 - that's smarter stronger
24:06 - its predicting capabilities are far
24:07 - stronger than any human
24:09 - one machine can have more power than all
24:12 - the humans combined in the world
24:14 - intellectually physically all of the
24:16 - above so that's a scary proposition
24:18 - so when you're building things that have
24:20 - machine learning and
24:21 - you know whether it's supervised or
24:22 - unsupervised and you're putting it out
24:24 - there in the world
24:25 - it's a scary thing and i think what this
24:27 - show in this scene did so brilliantly is
24:30 - it painted this picture and just
24:32 - left it over to you and i as the viewers
24:34 - like what does that
24:35 - mean for our world tell me in the
24:37 - comments
24:38 - so far this show was super amazing i had
24:41 - a lot of fun just watching that one
24:43 - scene and the level of detail that went
24:44 - into coding
24:45 - takes my heart away and breath away i
24:48 - love
24:48 - when it's coding related and they get
24:50 - technical and there's even technical
24:51 - lines of code
24:53 - i'm going to give this a 9 out of 10 on
24:55 - the developer skill
24:57 - that wraps up our worst to best
25:01 - i hope that you enjoyed watching a real
25:04 - developer
25:04 - react to all these tv show scenes let me
25:08 - know what you would like me
25:09 - to react to next in the comments below
25:11 - you know what else is really cool
25:13 - just recently i reacted to gilfoyle from
25:16 - silicon valley debugging his code this
25:18 - video
25:19 - is absolutely amazing if you enjoyed
25:20 - this reaction definitely check out
25:22 - this reaction video that i made it's
25:24 - incredible click it
25:26 - go watch it now i love your beautiful
25:28 - face smash that like button subscribe to
25:30 - the channel
25:31 - and go watch it right now yes you
25:34 - go watch it i'll see you in that video
