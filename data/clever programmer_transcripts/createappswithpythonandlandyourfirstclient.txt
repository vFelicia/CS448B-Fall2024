00:07 - hey guys how's it going
00:12 - this is going to be pretty cool because
00:16 - we have a livestream going on both
00:20 - YouTube and Facebook and this is my
00:26 - first time here in Romans group so
00:31 - basically today we're going to be
00:33 - talking about kind of the job
00:35 - opportunities that exist in the software
00:37 - development world we're going to be
00:40 - talking even about what programming
00:42 - language you should start off with we'll
00:46 - talk about what are some of the first
00:48 - things you should prioritize in order to
00:50 - get real hands-on experience and work
00:53 - okay and then I'll be taking your guys's
00:57 - questions along the way cool cool all
01:04 - right awesome we got a bunch of people
01:10 - coming in on YouTube we got a bunch of
01:12 - people on Facebook I can't see the
01:15 - comments on Facebook I'm going to click
01:17 - here hmm okay I'm going to try to figure
01:25 - out how I can see the comments so then I
01:27 - can answer your guys's questions along
01:29 - the way yep
01:33 - shouldn't this has started let me
01:37 - refresh here this live stream stuff
01:41 - always always a little bit finicky we're
01:49 - going to wait for a few more people to
01:50 - come in as well
01:56 - okay cool
02:05 - all right
02:12 - there we go okay so when did you guys
02:22 - kind of start coding you know give me a
02:24 - sense of it so we on Facebook we have a
02:26 - new audience that's kind of just getting
02:28 - to know me on YouTube you know you guys
02:31 - know me already maybe some of you guys
02:33 - are new so why don't you guys tell me
02:36 - kind of how long have you been coding
02:38 - for you know when did you start a
02:40 - programming you know I'll just be uni
02:52 - and I'm going to take on your questions
02:55 - and answer them live if I can see your
02:57 - questions so that's what I'm trying to
02:59 - figure it out oh okay cool
03:14 - alright Roman just sent me the link to
03:17 - the live
03:17 - ooh nice ok no feedback please mute mute
03:25 - and be muted meeting all right beautiful
03:34 - ok now I can see all your guys's
03:36 - comments perfect
03:37 - alright so great some people said for
03:40 - years George he says I started five
03:43 - years ago let me look over on what's
03:45 - going on what's the story on YouTube
03:48 - this is cool I got 2 things opened up
03:50 - here last year some people started in
03:54 - University cool so ultimately you know
03:58 - it really doesn't matter how long have
04:00 - you been coding for when you kind of
04:03 - started how much experience you have you
04:06 - know obviously if you have a lot of
04:08 - experience it's really good
04:09 - right but if you're starting out now
04:11 - that's totally fine as well because in
04:14 - my live webinar tomorrow which is like
04:17 - my live master class I really talk about
04:20 - the differences between a broke
04:22 - programmer versus a profitable
04:24 - programmer and one of the key things
04:26 - you'll recognize that I'll explain is
04:29 - that the difference isn't necessarily
04:31 - the experience or even the skills so you
04:37 - know I'm going to kind of go into that a
04:39 - little bit more tomorrow but you know
04:42 - first of all I just want to talk about
04:43 - the kind of the job opportunities that
04:45 - exist for software development you know
04:48 - that's where I kind of think the world
04:49 - is headed literally everything is being
04:52 - run on software from this live stream to
04:57 - Facebook itself to Instagram and all of
05:00 - that right now let me ask you guys what
05:03 - programming language are you guys using
05:06 - Oh some people started a week ago 20
05:11 - years ago great 20 years ago
05:16 - nice lots of experience
05:32 - okay PHP Java that's great so um you
05:37 - know one of the programming languages
05:39 - that I use and I teach at clever
05:41 - programmer a lot is Python and the
05:45 - reason why I kind of teach that is
05:47 - because it's at the intersection of you
05:49 - know one being one of the easiest
05:51 - programming languages to being one of
05:53 - the most popular and trending languages
05:57 - and also it's a multi-purpose and a
06:01 - pretty high paying programming language
06:03 - right there's a lot of demand for it so
06:06 - in the start it doesn't matter so much
06:09 - what language you choose because again
06:12 - it's mostly about what ideas you have in
06:14 - here and how you can bring them to
06:16 - reality right and what value can bring
06:18 - to other people with your skills that's
06:20 - really the key but what I advise is pick
06:25 - way if you're starting out you're brand
06:27 - new right pick something that's simpler
06:30 - but it's also powerful right because
06:32 - with Python you know Google was built
06:35 - off of Python right this is something I
06:37 - talk about all the time but I know
06:40 - there's a lot of new people so you know
06:42 - Google was built off of Python Instagram
06:45 - was built off of Python reddit was built
06:47 - off of Python right so lots of big
06:50 - powerhouses are actually being powered
06:53 - by Python and I'm not saying that it's
06:55 - more powerful than other languages I'm
06:57 - just saying that not only is it an easy
07:00 - language but you can scale it right and
07:02 - have a future in it if you were to start
07:05 - right now and then go further but if you
07:09 - start it off with JavaScript and you're
07:11 - already getting experience in it then
07:13 - stick with it stick with one programming
07:15 - language because what's really important
07:17 - are the concepts not necessarily the
07:20 - specific programming language syntax
07:22 - right the specific way you like write a
07:25 - squiggly or bracket and you close a
07:27 - function open a function like all of
07:29 - those things like lexical closures and
07:31 - all this fancy stuff that you can you
07:32 - get into that's not a huge deal the
07:35 - first thing you have to do is just wrap
07:36 - your mind around how this works and this
07:38 - a webinar is mostly for beginners okay
07:42 - so I'm going to be explaining lots of
07:45 - things to people who are kind of
07:46 - starting out that's my main focus and
07:49 - people also who are looking to switch
07:51 - into the programming field or you're
07:54 - just trying to figure out how you can
07:55 - start using programming to start getting
07:58 - clients or where to even look for work
08:02 - things of that nature alright so some
08:06 - people are asking me how long do you
08:08 - spend on coding how long arm somebody
08:11 - says you have a sexy voice thank you
08:13 - very much it's a great compliment 111
08:19 - people hundred people on YouTube and 111
08:23 - people on Facebook
08:24 - cool this is awesome this is weird
08:29 - Facebook is almost beating my youtube
08:31 - come on YouTube let's let's kick it up a
08:33 - notch alright so how long do I spend
08:36 - every day on coding programming um it
08:40 - depends you know I I you I was spending
08:42 - about 15 hours to 20 hours a day when I
08:45 - was picking it up you know that was one
08:48 - of the ways where I was able to pick it
08:50 - up in less than three months a lot of
08:52 - people go crazy they're like you can't
08:54 - pick it up in three months it takes 25
08:56 - years and like a boatload of experience
09:00 - and all that and yes I mean of course
09:02 - you know to get become a really
09:05 - high-level professional become really
09:06 - skilled that's how long it will take you
09:09 - but to say that you can't actually get
09:11 - work to say that you can't actually
09:14 - start earning an income and making a
09:16 - living off of it
09:18 - that's just BS you know because one of
09:21 - my biggest problems one of the reasons
09:23 - why I started this channel is that
09:24 - everybody always makes it seem like to
09:26 - break into this industry you have to
09:28 - have like ten years of experience or you
09:30 - have to have so much knowledge and all
09:33 - of that right so not necessarily true my
09:37 - background pretty weak in math um I mean
09:43 - I've worked hard in math and to kind of
09:45 - make up for it but still like math is
09:47 - not my forte I'm not necessarily like
09:49 - you know a genius but I just spent a lot
09:52 - of time working on it and it's kind of
09:54 - just like you know you pick up
09:56 - and then it becomes natural to you
09:58 - programming is kind of like that too you
10:00 - know I just did it a lot and then it
10:02 - became a way that I was able to think in
10:05 - it but what's more important are the
10:07 - skills that are around programming you
10:10 - know the skills of how do you market
10:12 - yourself how do you position yourself
10:13 - how do you stand out from the crowd and
10:17 - how are you able to get work you know
10:20 - those are the skills that ultimately
10:22 - really really matter obviously obviously
10:26 - your actual skills in coding matter as
10:29 - well because if you can't do programming
10:31 - then nobody is going to hire you right
10:32 - but to get work to get entry-level work
10:35 - to get junior developer level work or
10:39 - even to work as a freelancer right and
10:42 - get clients that's not hard and doesn't
10:45 - necessarily always require like three
10:47 - years of experience for it in like
10:50 - entry-level job okay all right so this
10:58 - is great a lot of people are on the
11:01 - channel I love programming have you know
11:07 - lots of experience you guys are very
11:08 - experienced this is really great and you
11:11 - guys have experience with multiple
11:12 - different languages so that's another
11:13 - thing I want to kind of expand on if you
11:15 - pick one language that doesn't mean that
11:18 - you're kind of stuck with that language
11:20 - right if you let's say start off a
11:22 - JavaScript or let's say you start off
11:24 - with c-sharp it doesn't mean for the
11:26 - rest of your life you're a c-sharp
11:27 - developer or a JavaScript developer that
11:30 - just means you know that's what you kind
11:32 - of start off with and you could choose
11:34 - to just pursue that one language or then
11:36 - kind of branch out like for example you
11:39 - know I'm huge on Python I just think
11:41 - it's the best one to start off with and
11:43 - most of the top universities agree
11:46 - you know UC Berkeley and MIT and all of
11:49 - them are switching over to starting
11:51 - people off with Python and they don't do
11:53 - it based off of feelings they do it with
11:55 - statistics and facts and they figure out
11:57 - that students just get better results
11:59 - when they start off with the language
12:01 - that doesn't necessarily get in their
12:03 - way
12:03 - it it just lets you implement your ideas
12:05 - at a very fast speed right so you're not
12:08 - held down by the syntax
12:10 - you just kind of get going you're very
12:11 - productive but let's say then after you
12:14 - get those core concepts and you want to
12:16 - transition then you can switch over to
12:19 - another language so for example let's
12:21 - say you want to do web development with
12:23 - Python right you start off with Python
12:26 - you experience in it now you can pick up
12:28 - JavaScript and then you know use that
12:31 - use a framework like flask or Django and
12:34 - now you have to learn HTML CSS and you
12:37 - kind of you know work with them together
12:39 - okay so don't necessarily think that
12:41 - you're stuck with one but I do think
12:44 - that the first language you choose is
12:46 - important and I also think it's
12:48 - important to kind of stick with it to
12:49 - get the concepts down yes being familiar
13:01 - with Linux will of course be an
13:03 - advantage being familiar with the
13:05 - command line will be an advantage so you
13:07 - know if you get extra time I'll work
13:09 - with those things you know try to that's
13:11 - why what I suggest all the time is
13:15 - especially I see a lot of beginners they
13:17 - want to just use some big fancy
13:20 - they're called eye bees so they want to
13:23 - use just some big fancy tool to run
13:25 - their code for them but they don't
13:26 - understand how it's actually running so
13:28 - I always recommend to use the command
13:30 - line as much as you can you know like
13:32 - stick with the command line you know
13:34 - that ugly looking black screen that has
13:35 - code like matrix you know use that to
13:39 - get stuff done because you'll improve
13:41 - your skills a lot faster and I realize
13:44 - there's a the audience we have right now
13:47 - you know you guys some of you guys are
13:49 - you've been you have a lot of experience
13:52 - and some of you guys are just starting
13:53 - out so I'm trying to meet you half way
13:55 - you know um I don't want to use like um
13:59 - I'm trying to meet you halfway but my
14:02 - focus again is on people who are kind of
14:03 - starting out and want to get that
14:05 - breakthrough yeah Ruby on Rails and all
14:12 - of those things are good skills to learn
14:14 - but what I recommend again is you know
14:15 - focus on one language whatever it is
14:17 - that you pick up go go hard on it right
14:20 - just focus on one thing
14:23 - and then improve your skills in that one
14:25 - thing for a while for getting actual
14:29 - work it's not that hard you know it's
14:32 - good to do programming problems and
14:35 - exercises to improve your skills and go
14:37 - through the academic route which I'm not
14:39 - a huge fan of but it's kind of good to
14:41 - do that you get something you get your
14:42 - feet wet but you know focus on
14:44 - project-based learning so where you can
14:47 - actually go and get real-world projects
14:51 - that represent what you do in real world
14:53 - so instead of you know if you have a
14:57 - choice of making a factorial problem
15:00 - versus you know a choice of doing a
15:02 - project that's like a web app I would
15:05 - say try to choose the web app because at
15:07 - the end of the day you have something to
15:08 - show for it and you have real-world
15:10 - experience whereas you do the factorial
15:13 - problem you really don't have anything
15:14 - to show for it um and I have done the
15:20 - more technical things my whole you know
15:23 - career like when I was starting out
15:24 - that's kind of what I did just started
15:27 - off doing very you know just hardcore
15:30 - stuff you know in the command line all
15:33 - the time doing programming problems like
15:36 - factorials and whatever right those
15:38 - those problems that you get on project
15:40 - Euler hacker ranked I was doing all of
15:42 - that but then at the end of the day what
15:44 - I would realize is that I didn't have a
15:46 - portfolio that I could show people so
15:49 - some of the resources I want to give you
15:51 - guys that are excellent and are free I
15:53 - suggest you write them down like
15:55 - literally have a pen and pencil next to
15:57 - you and write these down because these
15:59 - were some of the things that helped me
16:00 - become you know a software consultant at
16:04 - less than three months like I went from
16:05 - knowing nothing about programming to
16:08 - knowing enough where I was proficient
16:10 - and I was actually working with clients
16:13 - making enough money to replace my job
16:16 - that I was doing right and then I just
16:18 - after that that allowed me to just kind
16:19 - of break through and break into this
16:21 - field so some of the resources are going
16:23 - to give you they're all free so one of
16:27 - them is Coursera right some of you guys
16:30 - might know it some of you guys may not
16:32 - it spells see oh you are Ser
16:35 - eh if some of you guys know it write it
16:38 - down in chat so other people could see
16:39 - how it's spelled
16:42 - another great resource is Udacity okay
16:47 - that's two so just for now just write
16:49 - these down you don't have to actually
16:50 - open up the tab because when I'm trying
16:53 - to share with you guys is you know might
16:55 - be actually really important for you so
16:56 - just save this for now so then you can
16:58 - go to it later
17:00 - Udacity is great if something is covered
17:04 - on Udacity you generally don't need to
17:05 - go to another one to cover it you can
17:08 - just kind of cover it from there juda me
17:11 - is pretty good but generally I try to
17:13 - stick with Udacity and Coursera because
17:15 - you did me generally just like one guy
17:17 - in his basement you know making the
17:19 - video so he can make some profit on the
17:21 - side some courses are really good but
17:24 - you know most of them are just they're
17:27 - just kind of weird you know there's very
17:29 - low production quality and also the
17:31 - material they're teaching and there are
17:33 - a lot of the times there's a lot of
17:35 - sacrifices that they make just so they
17:37 - can bust out and and get that entire
17:39 - course kind of done but you know have
17:42 - udemy definitely at the back your head
17:44 - in the list and then you can go to these
17:46 - resources and learn from them for free
17:49 - another one is EDX EDX okay so that's a
17:53 - really good one you can try out thank
17:58 - you guys for writing this down okay
18:08 - cool we got lots of people um yeah and
18:12 - so where my and for you guys who don't
18:15 - know me you know I'm the CEO founder of
18:17 - clever programmer it now is a entire
18:20 - company it kind of just started off with
18:22 - me and I was just like I want to teach
18:25 - people programming because how they're
18:27 - teaching it in schools they kind of
18:30 - screw a lot of people over and I saw
18:33 - lots of my friends quit programming or
18:35 - software development but it wasn't
18:37 - because they thought programming or
18:40 - whatever sucks it was just that they
18:42 - thought they weren't being taught it the
18:44 - right way or at least they didn't know
18:47 - that but I would see that and I would
18:48 - know because the first week the
18:50 - professor would give them hello world
18:51 - and the next week they would be doing
18:52 - some ginormous project and then I saw
18:55 - other people quit because for years and
18:58 - years they just did theoretical crap
18:59 - then they got graduated and then they
19:02 - didn't have real skills to actually get
19:03 - a job like what's the whole point of
19:05 - going through college and putting in all
19:07 - this tremendous amount of effort doing
19:09 - all this theoretical stuff that when you
19:11 - get out nobody sees you as somebody
19:13 - who's able to help them or skilled or
19:15 - practical they just see you as this
19:17 - weird esoteric theoretician right so go
19:22 - if even if you're going to college you
19:24 - know keep going but just understand that
19:26 - you know being practical versus just
19:29 - theoretical or very two different things
19:31 - you know one will keep you a profitable
19:34 - programmer and the other one will keep
19:35 - you a broke really educated programmer
19:39 - so you want to either be but you want to
19:41 - be kind of balanced right not just go
19:43 - crazy on one side you know so that that
19:48 - was one of the reasons why I actually
19:49 - made the clever programmer channel so I
19:52 - could share how to actually you know
19:55 - transition from your because nobody
19:57 - shares this stuff right the only share
19:59 - technical programming software
20:01 - development stuff but they're not
20:03 - necessarily sharing how do you take your
20:05 - technical skills how do you approach a
20:07 - client where do you find a client how do
20:10 - you actually get a job even if you have
20:12 - no experience how do you actually make
20:14 - that transition from your current job
20:16 - right what if you have a current job
20:18 - right now how do you actually
20:20 - find time to start coding in a realistic
20:22 - way and then make that transition as
20:24 - fast as possible where you start earning
20:27 - income with programming like they take
20:30 - the money in but they're not working to
20:32 - put the money back in your pocket right
20:35 - so not to say that the courses aren't
20:39 - great is just that they aren't teaching
20:40 - you skills that are very important for
20:43 - you to become profitable or earn a
20:44 - living with programming and actually be
20:48 - successful in it right like one of my
20:50 - mentors this is a story I sent out in an
20:53 - email today one of my mentors and this
20:55 - guy always wore this like ugly blue
20:57 - hoodie and he was a phenomenal
20:59 - phenomenal coder unbelievable programmer
21:02 - he was programming since he was like
21:04 - four he would literally only work with
21:08 - me for that hour that he was paid right
21:11 - when in my earlier days when I wanted to
21:13 - pick up programming I would hi I hired
21:15 - him so he could tutor me so I would go
21:18 - to my other job and any money that I got
21:20 - I would spend it to kind of increase my
21:22 - programming skills I would learn on my
21:24 - own and then I hired this tutor or
21:26 - mentor or coach he literally only worked
21:30 - with me within that one hour and then
21:31 - after the second that hour was over he
21:34 - that like that was it he stopped anytime
21:36 - I asked him about technologies that were
21:38 - outside of his scope or that he didn't
21:41 - know or he didn't cover he would just
21:42 - tell me like no can't help you with that
21:45 - any time I asked him about advice he
21:48 - would say things like you know do what's
21:52 - best for you right so I wanted to know
21:54 - should I keep pursuing my college or
21:57 - should I focus more on getting clients
21:59 - or how can I even get more clients and I
22:02 - never really got any real help that was
22:06 - useful but then later on I got a much
22:09 - much much better mentor who I even paid
22:13 - more and he didn't start coding since he
22:18 - was five but he was very profitable he
22:21 - was earning more than ten times what my
22:23 - previous mentor or my previous coach was
22:26 - making so this kind of goes to show you
22:29 - that yes experience is really important
22:32 - but there are a lot of sauce
22:34 - that are important but you know it's one
22:36 - thing to learn only the technical skills
22:38 - for programming from one place only the
22:41 - soft skills from a completely another
22:42 - place and then having to do the
22:44 - guesswork on your own my I'm what I'm
22:47 - trying to do is take that away from you
22:49 - and just show you them together like
22:52 - building your technical skills alongside
22:54 - your soft skills so you can start you
22:57 - know getting clients getting work having
23:01 - something to show for what you're doing
23:04 - more of this is going to be covered if
23:05 - you guys are on the Facebook page or if
23:08 - you're on the YouTube in the link below
23:11 - I have my master class so that's going
23:15 - to be covered in that as well I go a lot
23:18 - more in depth about all of this stuff
23:20 - okay so how do you actually go about
23:21 - getting a client where can you start
23:24 - today even better resources that you
23:27 - guys can start using because there's a
23:29 - lot beneath the surface that goes on and
23:33 - it's a free masterclass so you join it
23:36 - you know you watch it then those skills
23:39 - you can actually apply right away right
23:42 - I even show you like some of the places
23:43 - where you can actually go to apply today
23:47 - to start like earning income like one of
23:50 - the places I'll tell you right now is
23:52 - called up work okay so some of you guys
23:54 - might know it and if you go there and
23:56 - you literally type in Python or Python
23:59 - jobs or anything else you know
24:01 - JavaScript or whatever but my focus is
24:03 - teaching people Python but mostly I'm
24:05 - focused on teaching you the principles
24:07 - and you know like what actually what it
24:11 - actually takes to create those apps
24:12 - which you need to think about and
24:13 - actually how to deal with clients then
24:15 - you could take that and apply it to
24:18 - other things like JavaScript or whatever
24:19 - you want to kind of pursue you know so
24:23 - that's kind of what's covered in all of
24:26 - in the entire webinar that we're going
24:29 - to be talking about tomorrow as well
24:32 - somebody says how about Udacity Udacity
24:35 - is really good you know that's what I
24:38 - was saying like Udacity is unbelievable
24:40 - so if you have the option to learn
24:42 - something from Udacity first you should
24:44 - go there first that would be great
24:49 - all right um somebody says let's see
24:53 - looking at some questions you know like
24:57 - my big thing is not necessarily always
25:00 - get a job and then just work there
25:03 - nine-to-five I'm pretty big on having
25:07 - clients being able to choose my own
25:08 - hours being able to work remotely even
25:12 - having the ability to fire your clients
25:14 - that's a great feeling when somebody is
25:16 - just being a pain in the ass you have
25:18 - the ability to do that but you know you
25:20 - can take those skills and if your goal
25:22 - is to then apply and become a software
25:24 - developer full time job you can
25:26 - certainly use those to do that as well
25:31 - yes so Tim Sullivan tasks team tree
25:35 - house team tree house is a great
25:36 - resource that is one of the resources I
25:39 - personally haven't used that much but I
25:42 - know that it's really good some like one
25:44 - of my best friends who is also now a
25:46 - developer he used he uses team tree
25:50 - house so definitely one of the resources
25:54 - to check out you know and all you other
25:56 - guys who never heard of it write it down
25:58 - because what's really important is for
26:01 - you to find that right person that
26:03 - clicks with you or that right teacher
26:04 - right mentor right website whatever it
26:08 - is because sometimes you know what works
26:11 - for me might not work for you so you
26:13 - might go through all these fuss five or
26:15 - six different free resources I just
26:17 - shared with you and you might find out
26:19 - that one of them is your favorite you
26:21 - know and it might not be Udacity Udacity
26:24 - was my favorite and then just use that
26:27 - to kind of like pick up those skills and
26:28 - you know improve them and kind of get
26:30 - better at it
26:36 - on the new Boston at least an early
26:40 - stage
26:41 - yeah the new Boston is a good resource
26:43 - to go to you know I used to look at a
26:48 - bunch of his tutorials but again what's
26:50 - missing is like okay great I make all
26:54 - these little games and text programming
26:58 - you know text-based games and you know
27:03 - he shows you how to play with tech enter
27:05 - and Python framework but you know I
27:08 - don't see the connection between that
27:09 - and where to actually go to get clients
27:13 - so then and and how do I use what you've
27:15 - shown me in my portfolio because in my
27:18 - free you know in my even in my free
27:20 - Python courses I show you how you can
27:25 - actually take what you're learning even
27:27 - throughout the free course and just like
27:29 - start applying it to your portfolio so
27:32 - you can actually start working towards
27:36 - getting clients getting work I try to
27:39 - keep it applicable to that sense but
27:41 - definitely if you are not interested in
27:43 - looking for those soft skills and you
27:45 - just want to get those technical skills
27:46 - the New Boston is a really cool fun guy
27:49 - he's very calm he has a very fun style
27:51 - to teach unlike most other people who
27:54 - are just like it just seems like they're
27:55 - bored to death and I'm thinking how
27:57 - could you be bored to death this is one
27:59 - of those fields where you literally get
28:01 - to create whatever you want um like the
28:06 - first time I got paid to do computer
28:08 - programming I thought it was like a
28:11 - glitch I'm like are this seriously
28:13 - paying me for it's almost like playing a
28:15 - video game and it's like I'm just
28:17 - getting to create whatever I want
28:18 - whatever ideas I have in my head and
28:20 - they were paying me for that and I'm
28:22 - almost thinking is somebody gonna catch
28:24 - on to this and are they going to stop
28:25 - paying me at some point and to this day
28:28 - I think that because for its it's
28:32 - honestly incredibly fun because you are
28:34 - creating whatever the hell you want and
28:37 - so I never understand like it's your
28:40 - ideas in your brain and then you put
28:44 - them and now they're scalable to
28:45 - millions of people
28:47 - imagine you know this
28:49 - game on iPhones called dancing line if
28:52 - you don't have it get this game
28:55 - unbelievable game okay you can download
28:57 - it for free it's called dancing line
28:58 - somebody knows about it type it in the
29:00 - comments so other people can know what
29:02 - it is literally one of the most fun
29:04 - games ever some developers had an idea
29:07 - they wanted to make this thing to put it
29:08 - together and now it you know and it was
29:11 - good people liked it and it's solving a
29:13 - problem for millions of people that's
29:16 - what I love about software development
29:16 - it's not just you get to do fun work
29:20 - that's but it's it's really meaningful
29:22 - and impactful work that's changing the
29:24 - lives of hundreds thousands or millions
29:27 - of people you know that's what I kind of
29:32 - like about it you find a problem in
29:34 - let's say the world of fitness right you
29:38 - create a solution and now it's scalable
29:41 - all of a sudden millions of people and
29:42 - they have it on their Android and on
29:44 - their Apple phones you create a solution
29:47 - for um you know nutrition and all of a
29:51 - sudden everybody has it you create
29:53 - something for solving an illness or you
29:57 - know a wiki for knowledge and all of a
30:00 - sudden everybody has it or Web Apps you
30:03 - know even web apps like Instagram and
30:08 - even like random stuff whatever ideas
30:10 - you have a gaming app like for example I
30:12 - play I used to play FIFA a lot you know
30:15 - it's a soccer game and my brothers and I
30:19 - we would always try to create these
30:20 - World Cups so you know you go in the
30:23 - quarter-finals and then you go into
30:25 - semifinals and then you go into finals
30:27 - but FIFA didn't really have that to play
30:30 - with your friends or your brothers or
30:32 - whatever in a nice way and so then I
30:35 - coat it up a web app that did that and
30:39 - then it randomly selects teams for you
30:41 - it randomly puts you and when you click
30:44 - on you know when you click on which team
30:45 - you want and then you put in the scores
30:48 - and who want it automatically you know
30:49 - moves the right teams to the
30:51 - quarter-final stage to the semi-final
30:53 - stage into the final stage like that's
30:55 - pretty exciting you know I was pretty
30:57 - excited that you could just literally
31:00 - take what's here and just may
31:03 - get a reality
31:17 - the ways to finding tech jobs yeah
31:20 - they're pretty similar in most countries
31:22 - here's why people get too caught up in
31:25 - the minutiae like the the syntax of the
31:29 - code or the technical stuff like oh the
31:31 - application thing is not the same or you
31:33 - know like a few processes are different
31:37 - but mostly the idea of getting work is
31:41 - pretty simple you know some people even
31:44 - somebody like James all teacher who has
31:47 - like started 20 different companies he's
31:49 - a software developer founder of so many
31:52 - companies and he's he's a pretty
31:54 - unbelievable guy if you don't follow him
31:55 - follow James all teacher but you know he
32:00 - says that your ability to get work is as
32:02 - is directly proportional or whatever to
32:06 - your ability of getting coffee with
32:08 - somebody so there's a lot of you know
32:11 - it's not like you're trying to trick
32:12 - people but people want to work with
32:15 - people they like and so there's a lot of
32:17 - soft skills and social skills involved
32:19 - that people don't teach together with
32:22 - the concept of programming right so
32:24 - programming is one aspect and then you
32:26 - have this whole another aspect of how to
32:28 - get good at jobs how to get good at
32:29 - interviews and what specific things you
32:31 - need this was for example in in your
32:36 - high school when you're taking those
32:38 - college a CTS
32:39 - it the way to score better on your call
32:44 - is re in your high school a CT which is
32:47 - the standard test in United States they
32:49 - used to kind of test your intelligence
32:50 - is not necessarily based on how smart
32:54 - you are but it's based on your skill of
32:56 - taking that test so the way to get good
33:00 - at that test is actually to take that
33:02 - test more and more times even though
33:03 - it's used to test your intelligence the
33:06 - way you get good at it is by taking that
33:07 - test and not necessarily by being
33:09 - smarter so that is pretty similar to the
33:14 - real world we're becoming a good
33:16 - programmer is not necessarily the same
33:18 - thing as getting good at getting good
33:21 - jobs or getting good work or getting
33:23 - good clients or knowing where to find
33:24 - clients and knowing how to keep a
33:26 - long-term relationship with clients you
33:28 - know knowing how to save
33:30 - client from leaving all of that and I
33:32 - use the term client a lot because you
33:35 - know I'm a huge follower of Johnson mez
33:37 - and one of the key things that he says
33:40 - that I agree with a lot is that even the
33:42 - people who hire you think of them as
33:45 - just like one client you're just getting
33:47 - a lot of work from that one client right
33:49 - which is your employer so yeah there you
33:52 - go I answered it all right I'm looking
33:58 - over some questions okay so you know
34:01 - again all of this stuff and much more
34:04 - will be covered in a lot more depth in
34:06 - that live training so if you're here
34:09 - literally stop go click that link and
34:12 - sign up for it if this is something
34:15 - you're even mildly interested in I
34:17 - promise you it could change your life
34:20 - because we're going to be covering a ton
34:23 - of stuff in there how do you learn to
34:26 - code in less than three months even more
34:28 - software resources that you can use that
34:30 - are free literally how you can start
34:33 - finding work what are the some of the
34:34 - best things you can start doing to
34:36 - combine your programming skills so you
34:38 - can start getting work you know all of
34:40 - those things get covered in a lot more
34:42 - detail and I'll also tell you my story
34:44 - of exactly how I was able to achieve
34:47 - those results in such a short amount of
34:50 - time so you could steal literally that
34:52 - and try to repeat it
35:05 - armed Oh is the link not there on the
35:09 - Facebook one no worries I am sending
35:17 - Roman the link and he should maybe put
35:24 - it up
35:38 - all right sorry about that

37:16 - beautiful said Robley signed up awesome
37:20 - Zullo signed up beautiful I'll take on
37:23 - more questions in the meantime from
37:25 - people Tim Sullivan asks I know Java and
37:30 - C++ you know and guys if you guys come
37:33 - to this it's not necessarily strictly
37:36 - related to Python or like a specific
37:40 - tool or whatever so if you come to this
37:43 - live webinar you'll pick up stuff that
37:46 - you can use immediately in your life
37:48 - right after leaving it and that means
37:53 - even if you are using some different
37:55 - programming languages or you know
37:57 - certain different tools all right let's
38:04 - see what are some of the other questions
38:06 - beautiful ah exit says signed up great
38:11 - signed up to sign up for the live master
38:15 - class that I'm doing tomorrow it's $0
38:19 - it's free okay sorry um the link is in
38:26 - the description so you can go there
38:40 - you know currently I'm working with
38:42 - clever programmer building up this
38:44 - entire brand most of my work was just
38:47 - working with salt you know consulting
38:49 - and making software for lots of
38:52 - different people and now my main focus
38:54 - is clever programmer we have over two
38:57 - million viewers we have 20,000 plus
39:00 - students enrolled in our programs and
39:02 - those numbers are just going insane
39:04 - actually now 27,000 people enrolled in
39:06 - our programs let's see YouTube
39:11 - subscribers 50,000 YouTube subscribers
39:13 - and this was and it started about six or
39:17 - seven months ago so it's really kind of
39:19 - taking off I was I started it when I was
39:23 - doing all you know doing work going to
39:28 - college with and then with everything
39:32 - else that I was doing you know I was
39:33 - doing like four or five different jobs
39:36 - and so I literally had maybe one or two
39:38 - hours to spare every day and in that
39:40 - time I would make the YouTube videos for
39:44 - clever programmer for Python programming
39:47 - or even like some videos I think I've
39:49 - made on sequel and this general soft
39:52 - skills as well in those times to kind of
39:56 - build it up and then after it kind of
39:58 - became a big thing I'm just focusing on
40:01 - it the entire time you know now we have
40:04 - a team of developers that clever
40:05 - programmer that I've actually hired and
40:08 - that you know that we that work on this
40:10 - team we have marketing development reps
40:13 - we have all just you know we have a big
40:16 - team of people that helps make courses
40:21 - people who are editing these videos as
40:23 - well so now all our focus is making the
40:28 - courses making videos on programming
40:31 - because there's just a big need for this
40:34 - so that's where most of the focus is at
40:36 - this point but I still do software
40:39 - development mostly for fun and then some
40:42 - of the clients I still work with okay
40:49 - Rob says that's very awesome great okay
40:55 - great some people have joined who has
40:57 - joined huh Roman joined nice good job
41:02 - Roman Rob thank you for putting that in
41:08 - the chat so everybody could see exactly
41:11 - what were kind of most of the places
41:13 - that I mentioned today oxide says you
41:21 - look sexy nice
41:22 - somebody's earlier said my voice is sexy
41:24 - now somebody says you look sexy
41:26 - all right yeah I've been you know
41:29 - because I get to work on my own time and
41:33 - with my own clients mostly on now I've
41:36 - been focusing on learning jujitsu
41:38 - learning Muay Thai boxing lifting and
41:42 - then besides that just spending time
41:45 - with my family and friends so I'm
41:48 - probably going to be traveling to
41:49 - California in in a few weeks and then
41:54 - the rest of you know and then also most
41:57 - of my time is spent on just working on
41:59 - clever programmer pretty much the entire
42:01 - time that's one of my biggest focus
42:13 - hey man is it great to go with Django
42:15 - because Python a Python guy aashiq says
42:19 - yeah it's a Django is an awesome
42:22 - framework for Python so for example if
42:25 - you guys don't know Django some people
42:27 - who do JavaScript they have frameworks
42:28 - like nodejs so python has frameworks
42:33 - such as flask and Django so my future
42:36 - courses are actually going to cover flup
42:40 - flask and Django in a lot of depth and
42:43 - this course that's coming out
42:45 - touches a little bit on flask but mostly
42:50 - it focuses on helping you start making
42:53 - money with Python in as little as 30
42:56 - days so that's one of my focuses of this
42:59 - new course that I'm going to be
43:01 - releasing in two days it gets launched
43:04 - act actually if you join the webinar it
43:06 - gets launched tomorrow and you get an
43:09 - early bird discount so this is a course
43:13 - that's focusing on not only Python but
43:17 - then immediately just like how do you
43:18 - actually get work and start getting a
43:20 - return on your investment but my all my
43:23 - other courses are free and I have one
43:26 - hundred and sixty videos on YouTube for
43:28 - training so if you just want to learn
43:31 - technical skills and you want to learn
43:34 - how to be proficient in programming and
43:36 - especially if you're kind of new to
43:38 - programming you know new when I say new
43:41 - you've been doing it for maybe a few
43:42 - months that would be the perfect start
43:45 - for you but if you have already been
43:47 - programming for a few years then those
43:49 - courses aren't going to be that helpful
43:51 - for you but the videos on getting
43:54 - clients finding work those are going to
43:57 - be really helpful for you and if you
43:58 - have experience you know start applying
44:00 - on places like up work there are
44:03 - literally so many jobs just type in
44:05 - Python jobs JavaScript jobs whatever and
44:07 - you get all these little nugget like
44:09 - projects so in my course I try to have
44:12 - you do those types of projects so then
44:14 - you can actually immediately apply to
44:16 - places and get you know started getting
44:18 - work that you can start putting on your
44:19 - portfolio but if you are if you already
44:22 - have experience you can start doing that
44:24 - now without necessarily having to take
44:26 - course or whatever the name of my
44:30 - youtube channel is clever programmer
44:32 - somebody wants to write that down in the
44:34 - description or in the chat go ahead do
44:37 - that I will love you I will love your
44:40 - face forever can we build a
44:47 - cryptocurrency blockchain I wish I wish
44:49 - I was that smart holy crap that would be
44:52 - unbelievable okay YouTube is now
44:57 - dominating Facebook like whiffed with
45:03 - twice the number of people on YouTube
45:06 - everybody who's on YouTube and everybody
45:09 - who is on Facebook if you have loved
45:12 - this so far yeah I love this if you
45:16 - didn't love it then don't sign up for
45:17 - the thing right but if you if you

45:23 - was useful go click on that link and
45:27 - sign up for that damn masterclass right
45:30 - that's where I want to see you it takes
45:32 - place tomorrow now two days from now
45:35 - whatever it's live it only happens once
45:37 - takes place tomorrow I'll be sharing
45:40 - some amazing secrets with you guys there
45:43 - as well and you lose nothing and
45:45 - everything that you take away from it is
45:47 - applicable right away ok so one hour
45:50 - long happens at 12 p.m. Chicago time
45:55 - tomorrow so click on that link and sign
46:01 - up
46:02 - beautiful michael says kishore says site
46:06 - is down
46:07 - really clever programmer calm can
46:11 - anybody confirm if the site is down
46:13 - that's scary um no I just went to clever
46:18 - programmer calm that doesn't look down
46:20 - I'll try the other one you lying to me
46:25 - let's see
46:31 - LC yro says where's your friend Tenzin
46:34 - Wow you know my friend Tom by name he's
46:39 - not here he's slacking I hope you're
46:44 - watching this Tenzin got to make those
46:47 - YouTube videos man it just takes a lot
46:54 - of like you know you just have to be
46:57 - consistent show up every every day
47:00 - that's what it takes you know building
47:02 - up this channel a lot of people like Oh
47:04 - an overnight successful not really like
47:07 - I literally gave up my life for the
47:10 - longest time spend 20 hour days working
47:12 - in the office I got this office I told a
47:16 - story yesterday but I'll tell it again
47:18 - so okay so here's the story I wanted to
47:22 - focus on this but the best way to focus
47:26 - is if you don't have a choice right if
47:28 - you have choices then you'll be lazy
47:31 - you'll procrastinate you'll be like oh
47:33 - the paper is due a month from now I'll
47:35 - just wait till the last day I won't do
47:36 - it today today I'll swatch some cat
47:38 - videos I was already very motivated to
47:41 - get clever programmer and this channel
47:43 - going but I thought what if I kick it
47:49 - into high gear right and go in survival
47:53 - mode so what I did is I like stopped
48:00 - working with all of the clients that I
48:01 - was working with gave up actually the
48:03 - job that I was doing cut all my sources
48:09 - of income got this office so there was
48:14 - an additional expense that actually
48:15 - actually had to cover and what happens
48:20 - when you're in such a dire survival mode
48:22 - your brain gets a very creative right
48:26 - and you become very creative and your
48:28 - work ethic is there and so what I
48:31 - started so then that allowed me to
48:34 - actually just focus and go crazy on
48:36 - building this entire channel building
48:38 - this entire you know now it's like a
48:41 - revolution it's not just a channel
48:42 - anymore
48:43 - because before it was just like okay
48:44 - it's just me putting videos and now it's
48:47 - all you guys you know that are part of
48:50 - this right and lots of people are
48:55 - getting amazing results so that is what
48:57 - kept me going and I just decided okay
48:59 - this is what I'm going to do and I'm
49:01 - just going to go kind of hard into it
49:03 - that's just how I think a lot of the
49:05 - times
49:05 - okay sites up great alright awesome
49:16 - um okay guys I'm going to start going in
49:20 - a little bit
49:24 - IRC room nice okay everybody on Facebook
49:29 - everybody on YouTube you know again
49:33 - you're enjoying this click on that link
49:35 - sign up for that thing I really want to
49:37 - see you guys tomorrow okay I want you
49:40 - guys to be there tomorrow Caleb yes I
49:44 - will do a vlog I've been thinking about
49:46 - that because there's just too much
49:47 - there's just too much stuff that I'm
49:50 - doing that's not only programming
49:52 - related and it's fun so I want to share
49:55 - that with you as well though you and I
49:58 - here are going to talk about programming
50:00 - stick to that but you know I would want
50:03 - to start that how long have I been
50:07 - programming about two years now to three
50:11 - years so actually not that long yeah but
50:17 - just to put into perspective my rates
50:22 - about like five times or more higher
50:24 - than the mentor that I was working with
50:26 - who had 20 years of experience when I
50:29 - started so I don't know if that puts it
50:34 - in perspective all right yeah the
50:38 - webinar is tomorrow 12:00 Chicago time
50:43 - Tim Tim is asking lots of good questions
50:45 - but I don't want to just keep answering
50:47 - Tim's questions I want also like look at
50:49 - some other questions looking for other
50:51 - questions mmm
50:55 - okay I'm going to answer Tim's question
50:57 - I guess Tim says what is a framework in
51:01 - a language framework is just something
51:03 - that makes your life simpler for example
51:05 - English is a framework to express your
51:08 - thoughts language emotions and feelings
51:10 - right
51:11 - you can still express your emotions to
51:13 - me but it's going well
51:16 - but in English you could just be like I
51:18 - really don't like you right now I want
51:20 - to kind of shoot you in the face get
51:21 - away from here it's a framework that
51:24 - helps you kind of put things into
51:26 - perspective so in programming you could
51:31 - think of it like that you know it's a
51:33 - framework that frameworks make your life
51:35 - easier when there are lots of repeatable
51:37 - tasks framework kind of take care of
51:39 - that because they know it's going to
51:41 - happen all the time
51:42 - one example okay and it might be an
51:44 - example I'm going to set the risk of
51:47 - maybe some of you guys for starting out
51:48 - might not know this but when you're
51:51 - doing web development you always have to
51:53 - kind of run a server instead of writing
51:54 - your own server all the time like it's
51:57 - obvious that you need to be running kind
51:59 - of server flasks just kind of comes
52:02 - built in with that logic of a server so
52:05 - then you don't have to kind of write
52:07 - your own thing know jazz does the same
52:09 - thing you know has lots of built-in
52:11 - default
52:12 - intelligent things so that's really a
52:14 - framework okay hopefully that explains
52:18 - it all right ap a regex how important is
52:24 - yet regex how often will it be used it
52:26 - really depends what you do if you're
52:28 - doing web development maybe it's that
52:31 - it's not that important it'll help you
52:33 - it'll make you faster but it your work
52:35 - won't be critically stuck on it but if
52:38 - you're doing lots of text analysis data
52:40 - parsing all that then you should be good
52:43 - with regex regex stands for regular
52:45 - expressions regular expressions mean you
52:50 - can find patterns in a text weird
52:55 - example maybe doesn't even make that
52:57 - much sense but um what are the best ways
53:00 - to explain it like for example if you
53:04 - did ctrl F right now and you try to find
53:07 - for some
53:08 - word and you try to differentiate
53:10 - between a Python with the capital P
53:12 - versus Python with the small P that's
53:16 - kind of hard to do but if you're in word
53:17 - document or something click on case
53:19 - sensitive right but what if you want to
53:22 - find a specific pattern that has Python
53:25 - followed by a number after Python one
53:27 - Python two now you can start using regex
53:30 - that only looks for the word Python
53:32 - followed by some numbers after it and
53:33 - any numbers and then it can highlight
53:36 - that and catch that whatever esoteric
53:38 - example it's one of those things that
53:40 - you kind of just have to look up look at
53:42 - a bunch of examples and then it starts
53:44 - making sense is used a lot of the times
53:46 - when somebody gives you their email
53:49 - address so if somebody gives you their
53:53 - email address you can use regex to
53:55 - figure out what's before the @ sign and
53:58 - then what's the domain after the @ sign
54:01 - so or if somebody gives you their phone
54:07 - number it has parentheses around it
54:09 - right so like think about this when
54:12 - you're filling out an application online
54:14 - and you're putting in on a phone number
54:17 - sometimes you might be wondering should
54:18 - I put the parentheses around it should I
54:20 - put the hyphens in it what if the
54:22 - computer reads those hyphens and get
54:23 - confused what if it's you know thinks
54:27 - it's something else but no matter how
54:29 - you put the number the computer
54:30 - automatically parses through it and
54:33 - understands what the actual number is
54:34 - and they're using reg X there as well um
54:42 - okay hopefully that kind of answers it
54:45 - mark says why don't I get your email I
54:48 - think you should have gotten my email
54:50 - now well but explain to me what like why
54:53 - why were you expecting to get an email
54:55 - from me so then if there's something
54:58 - wrong on my end I can fix it and I'll
55:00 - manually send you an email Kishore thank
55:05 - you for all Indian guys or all Indian
55:08 - girls everybody's welcome okay girl guys
55:12 - everybody's welcome it will be 10:30
55:16 - p.m. that's when the webinar happens
55:21 - I signed up where can i watch it
55:24 - tomorrow don't worry about it if I have
55:26 - your email you'll get the right time and
55:29 - everything in the email I'll send you
55:31 - multiple emails tomorrow reminding you
55:33 - about the webinar everybody who's here
55:36 - if you're still here click on that link
55:40 - and sign up for that webinar I want to
55:43 - see you there
55:43 - happens tomorrow you learn skills of
55:46 - landing a client creating apps what can
55:50 - you do to get a job really fast how can
55:56 - you go about building your portfolio all
55:58 - those things and more the differences
56:01 - between broke programmers versus
56:03 - profitable programmers and I'll give you
56:06 - a hint it's not experience or skills so
56:11 - if you want to kind of learn more about
56:12 - it and even use my exact blueprint for
56:15 - how I learn all this stuff got it and if
56:19 - you want to just steal that show up to
56:21 - the webinar tomorrow all right please
56:27 - explain api's maestro Arthur good
56:29 - question API is application programming
56:32 - interfaces how should I explain it hmm
56:39 - let's say you want to use the power of
56:41 - entire Google in your app well you could
56:46 - write all the code that Google has so
56:49 - you can try to create your own Google
56:50 - Maps they'll be really complicated to
56:53 - use in your own web app it would take
56:56 - you a long time to create your own
56:57 - search engine and to create your own
56:59 - entire you know Google Maps you'll need
57:01 - to buy satellites and data centers and
57:03 - spend billions of dollars or you can use
57:08 - the Google API s and then just that just
57:11 - allows you to use Google Maps all of
57:15 - that code and everything into your own
57:18 - app so for example Yelp uses Google's
57:22 - API so when you look up a map in Yelp
57:25 - com they didn't create the map they
57:28 - didn't spend years and years and years
57:30 - of hard work creating it from scratch
57:34 - they just use Google's API and you get
57:36 - all those results okay so that's really
57:38 - what API is do it lets you just steal
57:41 - code or build on on the shoulders of
57:45 - giants think of it like that
57:50 - is Python better to land a job than
57:53 - learning c-sharp no there's no such
57:55 - thing
57:56 - you know there's job opportunities for
57:59 - both I say Python because Python focuses
58:02 - more on making you speedy and making you
58:05 - more productive the developer rather
58:07 - than C sharp which focuses on making
58:10 - your code faster and more productive my
58:16 - personal preference is Python arm but if
58:21 - you're already down the path on a
58:22 - specific language there's no reason to
58:24 - switch just focus on skills of getting
58:27 - better at jobs interviews getting jobs
58:30 - things like that you know those those
58:31 - soft skills but there's no like one
58:36 - language that's better or best than
58:39 - everybody else it comes to a preference
58:40 - you know ultimately um okay so I'm going
58:49 - to take last questions and then I am
58:53 - going to run because I got to start
58:59 - preparing for the giant event tomorrow
59:03 - which is going to be pretty exciting
59:05 - whoo I always get this like adrenaline
59:09 - rush before coming on the camera and
59:10 - then once I'm here with you guys you
59:12 - guys make me feel so calm and
59:13 - comfortable with your questions and you
59:15 - start talking when you guys don't ask me
59:17 - questions and I have no questions I'm
59:19 - kind of like worried I'm like I always
59:22 - get a little bit not nervous but I'm
59:27 - just thinking like what am I going to
59:29 - talk about now but then when you guys
59:30 - have questions I'm like oh cool
59:33 - all right like every time I blank out I
59:36 - literally just go to one of your guys's
59:38 - questions it's like such a simple trick
59:40 - it's awesome
59:43 - oh wow
59:47 - Rob that's a pretty deep question my
59:51 - YouTube don't worry about my youtube
59:53 - link just type in clever programmer on
59:55 - YouTube and literally it's the channel
59:58 - that's growing the fastest and it'll
60:00 - probably take over some really big
60:02 - channels soon like we started from zero
60:04 - to 50,000 subscribers because of you
60:06 - guys thank you thank you thank you thank
60:09 - you thank you um so yeah you'll find it
60:13 - just type in clever programmer or even
60:15 - my name but you guys don't know my name
60:17 - is Rafi Kazi Rafi Kazi I go by my last
60:22 - name cause II and I go mostly by Kazi
60:25 - from clever programmer okay cause II
60:29 - like kamikaze ok ROM asks haha nice ROM
60:42 - asks do you have a girlfriend
60:44 - is that what contributes to higher
60:46 - salary I don't have a girlfriend right
60:49 - now a but yes the ability to have a
60:53 - girlfriend does contribute to a higher
60:55 - salary because it means that you're
60:59 - somebody who people like to get along
61:01 - with so there you go
61:15 - okay now I'm going to answer the
61:17 - question will the constant use of a
61:19 - framework decrease your programming
61:22 - skills since a lot of it is automated
61:25 - beautiful question love that question
61:27 - really great question so basically he's
61:30 - saying like if you use lots of crutches
61:33 - does that limit your skill to a certain
61:37 - extent and that's why people who want to
61:41 - teach you and when you're learning we
61:43 - try to tell you like hey don't use all
61:46 - these big things that kind of take care
61:48 - of you and handhold you do it yourself
61:51 - and once you understand how to do
61:53 - yourself then use these big frameworks
61:55 - and these big technologies in the start
61:58 - I tell you don't even use an IDE because
62:01 - you don't know how to then use the
62:03 - command-line interment which is very
62:05 - important only switch over to an IDE
62:08 - which is an integrated development
62:10 - environment once you have that skill set
62:13 - and you actually understand how
62:15 - everything is working then you should
62:17 - use it so frameworks yes they can do
62:20 - that to a certain extent but when you're
62:22 - learning try to do most things from
62:24 - scratch okay and then start switching
62:27 - over to doing them from the framework
62:30 - great question wrap
62:40 - should you use mathematics should you
62:43 - practice mathematics more to be able to
62:45 - create calm complex or applications so
62:48 - like basically more complex applications
62:51 - you don't really need math so these are
62:55 - some of the big myths that I debunk in
62:57 - more details tomorrow you know do I need
63:02 - more math do I need to be smarter am I
63:05 - too old for this
63:07 - you know like am I too old to do
63:09 - computer programming we get into more
63:14 - depth on that because those are very
63:15 - important you know and they can have a
63:20 - big impact on your career but to answer
63:24 - to you right now
63:24 - more math no unless you're going to a
63:28 - specific field then yes it'll help like
63:31 - it'll help you more but will it stop you
63:33 - and it will make it hard for you become
63:35 - programmer absolutely not if anything I
63:40 - should be a good example of that I'm not
63:42 - a good mathematician at all and yet I
63:46 - was able to create very complex
63:47 - applications because the beauty in
63:51 - coding is that you build on top of
63:54 - already a lot of existing stuff so when
63:58 - you need to do something with a lot of
63:59 - complexity you gain a lot of the times
64:03 - use stuff that people have already built
64:07 - so when I have to do stuff with you know
64:09 - when I do machine learning stuff and
64:11 - when I do stuff that does image
64:14 - detection and when I do stuff that I can
64:16 - like look at two different videos and
64:18 - automatically tell you the differences
64:20 - between each or I do stuff that using
64:24 - Python creates an application where if
64:26 - you hold a ball in front of a camera it
64:28 - tracks the camera that's not me writing
64:31 - the math behind it somebody has already
64:33 - done that I use their frameworks I'll
64:36 - learn how to use those libraries and
64:38 - then I do those applications or whatever
64:42 - you still need to have the programming
64:45 - skills to put the pieces together and
64:47 - understand how everything works if your
64:49 - programming skills suck that
64:52 - is not a possibility for you so I want
64:56 - to answer that question very firmly that
64:59 - no math is not required to become a
65:02 - developer or a programmer somebody wants
65:05 - to challenge me go ahead ok Luciano asks
65:14 - arm certainly there are more profitable
65:19 - programming languages than others isn't
65:21 - it a clever idea to switch to a more
65:24 - profitable language yes if you can catch
65:31 - a trend switch to that earlier and be
65:34 - adaptable it's a very very smart idea
65:38 - don't be religious these are you know
65:42 - don't be like so close-minded if you're
65:44 - a Java developer like no Python no or if
65:47 - you're a Python developer to look down
65:49 - on every other language or every other
65:51 - tool or framework go we're kind of the
65:54 - trend is but don't let it distract you
65:57 - so for example if you're doing let's say
66:01 - c-sharp and you already kind of have a
66:05 - job and you realize and let's say you
66:07 - can make 70,000 80,000 or 90,000 dollars
66:12 - a year and then you see that in Python
66:14 - you can get a job for a hundred thousand
66:15 - one hundred and ten thousand you really
66:19 - think about if that switch is worth it
66:22 - if that time spent is really worth to
66:24 - switch that but now if you're on the
66:27 - other hand you're seeing a trend where C
66:28 - sharp is just getting dead and python or
66:32 - some other language like JavaScript is
66:34 - just skyrocketing then it's smart for
66:38 - you to start making that switch being
66:42 - adaptable pays off more than almost
66:44 - anything you know my oldest brother is
66:49 - almost doing a job you know where he's
66:53 - probably making quarter million dollars
66:55 - a year now and one of the biggest thing
66:57 - that he did was always switch you know
67:02 - very fast if he saw a different
67:04 - technology he would get that certificate
67:06 - so like my background you know even he
67:08 - taught me he helped me get my computer
67:11 - networking certification CCNA I then
67:13 - realized I didn't like computer
67:14 - networking but that's a story for
67:17 - tomorrow he basically told me or sorry
67:22 - basically what he did that made him so
67:25 - profitable and so good and so marketable
67:29 - was his ability to adapt to new
67:31 - technologies whereas other people
67:33 - anytime something obsolete they would
67:35 - just kind of die off because they had 20
67:38 - years experience and they had like their
67:41 - ego in the way that kind of crushed them
67:43 - so throw away your ego just enjoy life
67:46 - you know learn something that you'll
67:49 - enjoy doing and love and then if you
67:51 - need to make a switch because it helps
67:53 - your family more or you can support
67:55 - others nearby you more or you can just
67:57 - live a wonderful lifestyle you know do
67:59 - whatever you want that's a lot more
68:02 - important than a specific technology or
68:04 - a language
68:16 - okay my beautiful people I love you guys
68:20 - so freaking much oh and if you guys want
68:24 - to get a book you know get this book not
68:25 - my book by the way I know a lot of
68:29 - people always want to ask Python
68:30 - programming great book teaches you
68:32 - but basics somebody in the comments you
68:35 - know please type in the name of it it's
68:38 - called Python programming by John Zell
68:39 - so other people could see it but yeah
68:42 - thank you guys so much for being here
68:44 - and watching thank you
