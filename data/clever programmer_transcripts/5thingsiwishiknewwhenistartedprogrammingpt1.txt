04:29 - to those who are new what are we talking
04:31 - about today sunny so we are talking
04:32 - about five things that we wish we knew
04:35 - before we saw programming so pretty much
04:37 - will live the little tips and tricks
04:39 - that we wish we knew all of the little
04:41 - sort of hacks and sort of fast tracks
04:43 - and sort of like things that we've
04:45 - learned through the pain of the comment
04:47 - going through that journey ourselves and
04:49 - why we think it can save you guys a
04:51 - bunch of time so we're gonna drop a
04:52 - bunch of knowledge and you guys and
04:53 - hopefully you guys find it useful
04:55 - oh yeah the pain the pain is so great
04:58 - man there's just so much pain and
05:00 - programming sometimes you know just
05:03 - kinda you know let's take the shorter
05:06 - route so that's over here we write to
05:08 - hurt to talk about our pain exactly that
05:10 - pain guys I mean when you're sitting
05:12 - there debugging things for eight hours
05:14 - straight we're gonna help you out and
05:16 - cut that down at least by heart at least
05:18 - by half the time yeah but ya know green
05:23 - teas don't know green tea sometimes you
05:24 - have to be do the eight hours yeah it's
05:31 - from London nice it's five so I think at
05:38 - this point should we jump in no see
05:41 - let's do it guys hope you guys ready
05:43 - take out actually take out a pen and
05:45 - pencil right now like guys take out a
05:47 - pen and pencil actually or don't you
05:49 - know take like a Google Doc or whatever
05:50 - you want to write down and start write
05:52 - these things down just so you know just
05:53 - go ham on it some good content for you
05:55 - you know some good knowledge for you so
05:57 - yeah let's get into it sunny let's do so
06:02 - the first one that we want to talk about
06:04 - is so this is actually probably unique
06:07 - to a lot of people I don't think a lot
06:09 - of people would have heard about this
06:10 - but it's it's all our top tip actually
06:13 - is and it's surrounding yourself with
06:15 - other coders and mentors so now is gonna
06:18 - explain that one little bit yeah yeah so
06:22 - so obviously you know when you first get
06:24 - started it is it is extremely confusing
06:26 - right like like who like if you are a
06:29 - beginner like drop in the comments if
06:30 - yours is completely confused sometimes
06:32 - that were to even start what to even do
06:34 - right and I know when I started I was
06:37 - very confused on where to start but the
06:39 - thing is
06:40 - if you decide to you know surround
06:43 - yourself around other coders maybe for
06:45 - example maybe you go ahead and you go
06:46 - into a coding community maybe you go
06:49 - into you go ahead and go into a coding
06:51 - meetup right and you start to make
06:52 - friends with those other coders you have
06:54 - no idea how friendly other people are
06:57 - like to help you out to get you on the
06:59 - journey basically because on the hardest
07:02 - part is that start it is the beginning
07:04 - point of what do I even do exactly right
07:07 - like what do I even do so that that is
07:10 - kind of like my my take on that what is
07:12 - your takes honey yeah I couldn't agree
07:13 - more honestly I think like going to
07:16 - conferences and meetups most of them
07:19 - actually free guys so you have a bunch
07:20 - of JavaScript me ups always like in the
07:22 - major cities and things like that or
07:24 - even if you can't get to them most of
07:26 - them you can actually access live so I
07:28 - I'm always a fan of the firebase live
07:31 - sessions I'm not sure they're based in a
07:33 - different country and I can't get there
07:34 - but I always jump in on their lives and
07:37 - that it really really gives you an
07:39 - insight into sort of one the community
07:41 - and just seeing other people who are
07:43 - also working on the same problems that
07:44 - you think you're sometimes alone working
07:46 - on that always kind of helps write or
07:48 - get motivated and - when you go to these
07:51 - things guys networking just speak to
07:53 - everyone everyone is so friendly in the
07:55 - developer community
07:56 - yeah and when you go to these yeah it's
07:58 - just it really is gonna open your eyes
07:59 - up as to how awesome this community is
08:02 - yeah yeah don't be creepy about it
08:05 - obviously right just like you just you
08:06 - know just go up to people you know is
08:08 - like hey what's up you know possibly
08:11 - like hey hey give me give me some give
08:14 - me some knowledge you know yeah yeah
08:17 - most importantly I would say is just be
08:20 - nice right what you think about is like
08:22 - your head you're there to learn
08:23 - everybody else is there to learn and you
08:25 - have to see that it you know that when
08:28 - you surround yourself around those type
08:30 - of people yeah you're just gonna
08:31 - skyrocket so much like I personally
08:34 - honestly I kind of started on the more
08:36 - difficult side like I didn't have much
08:37 - difficulty I would say but like I didn't
08:39 - surround myself around mentors initially
08:41 - I was just kind of trying to do things
08:42 - on my own and I don't know Sonny do you
08:45 - know this but yo you know dream your
08:46 - dream Weaver yeah yeah I started on
08:50 - Dream Weaver bro you know when I first
08:53 - used
08:53 - Dreamweaver I couldn't even do the
08:55 - drag-and-drop functionality is insane
08:59 - but carry on yeah so like starting with
09:03 - Dreamweaver and I remember specifically
09:04 - the way I started building pages is I
09:07 - started building page it was like you
09:08 - know how right now you have like you
09:09 - know you have a routes like basically
09:11 - you click on a page that goes to another
09:12 - page right
09:13 - yeah but it's a route right so it uses
09:16 - some users like some things are
09:18 - duplicated some things are not some
09:20 - things are reused yeah I was basically
09:22 - duplicating every single page for every
09:25 - single new path oh yeah websites yeah
09:29 - yeah I mean it's a learning curve right
09:33 - it's the learning comes the only way you
09:34 - gonna know by playing out with things
09:36 - yeah I remember when I used dragon a
09:38 - dream even for the first time I was like
09:39 - oh it's just drag-and-drop
09:42 - like I can just drag this up in the drop
09:44 - and then that's why I first realized
09:45 - about display and container oh my god
09:49 - yeah it's a bit it's a bit scary when
09:50 - you first jump nerd stuff but yeah like
09:52 - we said surround yourself with the right
09:54 - people and even I can't stress enough
09:56 - like since I've been working with Nas
09:58 - Kazi Jakob everyone in the can and so of
10:01 - the team my productivity and my sort of
10:03 - skill set has gone sky high because
10:05 - lychee is just surrounded by positive
10:07 - people we're surrounded by people who
10:09 - wouldn't push themselves and motivate
10:10 - themselves to just be the best they can
10:12 - be surround yourself with those people
10:14 - and you naturally start to become like
10:15 - that so yeah exactly
10:18 - yeah santhi for me and let's let's give
10:20 - them some likes an actual bold points of
10:21 - like like okay where can they throw out
10:24 - Rick and I like say maybe let's go ahead
10:25 - like bring up an actual like whiteboard
10:28 - let's do it it's just like right down
10:29 - Kate like where would they find
10:31 - themselves like just rally themselves
10:33 - around other people those those other
10:34 - mentors yeah so we have a whiteboard
10:36 - over here I'll check this out it's fancy
10:40 - yeah I think we can actually pay okay
10:44 - yeah you can't I'm sure you can you can
10:47 - click that that that little prick chain
10:50 - picture icon no yeah it's some reason it
10:53 - does all right it's probably because
10:54 - we're cutting ourselves off you know
10:55 - we're cropping
10:57 - right now it's cropping out yo nose we
11:01 - have 541 people right now are you

11:42 - bunch of headache a bunch of time it was
11:44 - so what it just helped us be the best
11:46 - developers we can possibly be in that

11:49 - those tips and tricks with you guys and
11:51 - hopefully you guys find these valuable

14:17 - we were doing which is what the white
14:18 - board thing right where we talked about
14:20 - like that where where you can basically
14:22 - where you can strain yourself like what
14:24 - what where you can find your Cody yep so
14:28 - there's a few different places you can
14:30 - go to you guys so me and not if you got
14:32 - access to this whiteboard yep I do
14:35 - yeah that's nice so we're gonna talk
14:36 - about a few things so we'll just list
14:38 - them out here so I'm gonna start off by
14:39 - let's go ahead and let's see if this
14:42 - works
14:43 - so places okay awesome so what we talked
14:46 - about now so places where everyone can
14:49 - join a community or like places where
14:51 - you wake you where you can find it Cody
14:54 - mentor slash communities yeah yeah
14:57 - exactly so yeah guys make sure you read
14:59 - this stuff does it's great stuff okay
15:01 - yeah let me go ahead and hide that thing
15:03 - so you can guys can see this right yes I
15:07 - make sure you guys are writing this down
15:08 - and it'll be massive value to you and I
15:10 - hope you guys are in your journey okay
15:12 - so this is where you can find a cutting
15:14 - mentor so number one let's go ahead and
15:17 - start with so pretty much I would say
15:19 - the coding conferences so number one
15:22 - putting conferences right coding
15:24 - conferences are massive dice so Google
15:27 - Facebook all of them do massive coding
15:29 - conferences and they do this all the
15:30 - time and they pretty much I love them on
15:32 - free right so I love them of
15:34 - and you can go ahead and join them and
15:37 - you can just and most of them I would
15:39 - recommend you double check on them
15:40 - because they are free but they actually
15:42 - sell out really quick so I would go
15:44 - ahead and yeah on those yeah so let me
15:47 - go ahead and know why you go and explain
15:49 - them but yeah so number two guys is
15:55 - Facebook group as you know there's a ton
15:57 - of Facebook groups out there in terms of
15:59 - web development in terms of coding in
16:00 - terms of you know maybe JavaScript you
16:02 - want to focus on javascript but I would
16:04 - say yes go ahead and you know you can
16:06 - simply just go to those Facebook
16:07 - communities and just simply just start
16:10 - talking you know start making friends
16:11 - start helping each other out and what
16:13 - you will find is that yeah Oh from all
16:15 - the sudden you will go from basically
16:17 - just joining a Facebook community to now
16:19 - actually helping other people and those
16:21 - people will then want to help you on the
16:23 - other hand and they will want to get you
16:25 - more involved right so you'll get more
16:27 - involved you start to make friends and
16:29 - you basically it just trust me it's
16:32 - really hard to say what exactly you get
16:34 - like the actual poll points which you'll
16:36 - get of it but you will get friendships
16:38 - and you will get other people to mentor
16:40 - you and to help you out so make sure you
16:42 - go no sleep because it's very it's a
16:44 - very popular and then here's the best
16:45 - part like let's not very closer right
16:47 - now with the really cool part is let's
16:49 - say that you know you go ahead and you
16:52 - do participate Facebook groups and you
16:54 - were the beginner person right and you
16:56 - had someone else help you out which you
16:58 - can do at some point is let's say later
17:00 - on you go and get to you get to a point
17:04 - where you kind of know some things and
17:06 - you will learn some things now what you
17:08 - can do is because you are very much
17:10 - known in their Facebook group you can go
17:12 - ahead and actually now biscuit must
17:14 - promote yourself as someone who can
17:16 - coach other people who join that
17:19 - Facebook group right and now all of a
17:21 - sudden you went from now basically join
17:24 - your Facebook group knowing you having
17:25 - zero knowledge to two months later right
17:27 - actually basically coaching other people
17:30 - and actually making money off of that so
17:32 - that's a really cool part that's really
17:33 - cool part about Facebook groups oh yeah
17:34 - do not be afraid about doing that nice
17:36 - awesome guys I've just saw somebody so
17:40 - at I don't you the first point we
17:43 - mention about coding homes I see so
17:45 - somebody added a comment I'm gonna try
17:47 - and tag it now there was a really good
17:48 - calm
17:49 - it was this one here so somebody said
17:51 - hey Sonny where can I find web
17:52 - development group in London to learn
17:54 - from sighing so I think what it means is
17:57 - basically how well can you find those
17:58 - coding conferences in those places where
18:00 - you can pretty much get involved and a
18:02 - really really good one I'm gonna just
18:04 - point it out is a place called and me up
18:06 - calm so I'm gonna go ahead and share my
18:08 - screen and you can actually see this one
18:11 - so I would recommend that everyone goes
18:12 - and checks this out so let's go ahead
18:15 - and see if my screen yeah so meetup calm
18:17 - right so here all you need to do is go
18:19 - over to me up comm and type in for
18:21 - example let's just type in JavaScript
18:24 - London so JavaScript in London and this
18:27 - go ahead as a showing results for
18:28 - JavaScript and then you can see that
18:31 - react yes and JavaScript live coding
18:33 - game build a virtual reality snake game
18:35 - with JavaScript and guys this is
18:37 - actually a really interesting thing
18:38 - because I actually had to do that on an
18:39 - interview once so these things like
18:41 - really yeah like you can really just go
18:43 - to these just chat meet some cool people
18:45 - look getting started with JavaScript and
18:47 - this one's actually an online event so
18:49 - especially in lockdown right now it's a
18:52 - really really a thing for most people to
18:54 - actually go ahead and join him with
18:56 - these
18:56 - so meetup calm I would definitely
18:58 - recommend that you guys go and check
19:00 - that one out learn Java skip I do you
19:02 - look at I mean there's so much you guys
19:03 - there is so much out there and you don't
19:05 - have to be at the location you can see
19:08 - there's so many remote ones right so you
19:10 - can simply join that even if you're from
19:12 - a different country can still join it
19:13 - exactly you know silly some people say
19:16 - oh I can't find you know I can't find a
19:17 - Meetup
19:18 - yes you can it is there it is remote you
19:21 - have the internet you can use that as
19:22 - long as you got internet you're pretty
19:23 - much good as long as you're watching
19:25 - this video pretty much good cuz you have
19:26 - internet I'm guessing that's the only
19:28 - way how you can watch right I mean if
19:32 - you're watching this without internet
19:33 - you're onto something big please go back
19:42 - to a little list so we had number one
19:44 - was coding conferences number two was
19:46 - Facebook groups and number three this
19:48 - isn't you know I added so follow and
19:50 - engage with Instagram coding channels so
19:52 - this is something which I never actually
19:54 - used to do too much but I think it's
19:55 - actually a really good one to go ahead
19:58 - and do so if you're not following any
20:00 - channels you can go ahead
20:01 - follow me and us to get started but
20:04 - honestly guys there are really good
20:06 - chance for example Jacob inside of the
20:08 - inside of the clever program a team he
20:11 - has an amazing channel and even I'm not
20:13 - in the comment section right now just go
20:16 - ahead and find these people they're
20:17 - constantly dropping fire content so it's
20:19 - literally a case of you know just
20:21 - digestible snippets of information so
20:23 - like how do you like how to map through
20:26 - arrays in JavaScript could be one post I
20:28 - constantly just grow from my feet in the
20:30 - morning and amongst all the sort of
20:31 - rubbish that you get on Instagram I'll
20:33 - get a little gem yeah that would teach
20:34 - me some new ethics feature in JavaScript
20:37 - and I'm like oh that's pretty cool
20:38 - and not only that guys is if you
20:40 - actually get involved with these sort of
20:41 - coding channels chances are you're gonna
20:43 - be able to quickly find and recognize
20:46 - people who are constantly sort of
20:48 - engaging with the community and just
20:49 - literally send them a direct message
20:51 - send them a message in the medium hey
20:53 - what's up do you want a sort of like
20:55 - code together you can do pair
20:56 - programming that's actually how I
20:57 - started talking with Kazi and how I got
21:00 - in the team in the first place which was
21:01 - pretty much walking through Instagram so
21:03 - definitely go and check that out that
21:06 - kind of Avenue awesome yeah I mean same
21:09 - here that that's how I pretty that's
21:10 - pretty much how I also basically got got
21:12 - to be with Kazi and everybody else on
21:14 - the team you guys through Instagram it's
21:16 - a powerful tool through social media use
21:17 - it don't be afraid of it please it is
21:20 - such if you use it for our reasons
21:21 - you're gonna get the right things out of
21:23 - it exactly I think to go with it yeah
21:25 - yeah exactly
21:26 - awesome the next one I want to mentioned
21:29 - is actually subscribing to news that so
21:32 - yeah and so this one is kind of so yes a
21:36 - mentor can be a person or something like
21:38 - that but guys sometimes we don't
21:40 - actually have the sort of like the luck
21:42 - to find a good mentor so my next backup
21:45 - behind this would be subscribed to
21:46 - coding newsletters and this is actually
21:48 - something I only did fairly recently
21:50 - about maybe two years ago when I started
21:53 - to actually really do this properly so I
21:55 - was saying I'll show you guys two
21:56 - examples I have so let's go ahead and
21:59 - one of them is called JavaScript weekly
22:01 - so it's JavaScript weekly calm and all
22:04 - this one is basically you just put your
22:05 - email in and they'll just send you so
22:07 - this was the last one that they sent and
22:09 - you can see they just send you random
22:10 - sort of JavaScript packages that people
22:12 - have worked on so this one's a front
22:15 - that and honestly this really this is
22:17 - how I stay ahead of the game when it
22:19 - comes to like what's latest and what's
22:21 - new and and sort of like that's even how
22:23 - I found out about like things like the
22:27 - react context API react hurts all of the
22:29 - new things which came out sort of came
22:30 - out at the time I sort of just found out
22:32 - from these news and guys it makes it
22:34 - easy you just in the morning you get an
22:35 - email and it sort of makes everything
22:37 - makes everything easy so there's another
22:39 - one if you guys are enjoying the react
22:42 - content that we've been dropping go
22:44 - ahead and check out react status this is
22:47 - my favorite news air at the moment
22:49 - because they just oh dang it
22:51 - yeah they just literally said I think it
22:53 - might be the same company to be honest
22:55 - because they look yeah like that like
22:57 - basically the same the same website yeah
23:00 - the same website just changed it a
23:02 - little bits and bobs and guys these guys
23:04 - drop serious valuable stuff like when I
23:07 - means is so valuable that I've had
23:09 - professional jobs where literally I will
23:11 - go ahead and oh noes we are actually in
23:14 - the corner here so the I've actually
23:19 - used a bunch of the stuff that I see on
23:22 - here in professional jobs and they've
23:24 - actually paid really well from this or
23:26 - knowledge I've learned and also guys if
23:27 - you scroll down they actually usually
23:29 - have job opening so you can see here
23:31 - we've got jobs they also have some
23:33 - tutorials and stories so there's a bunch
23:35 - of things that you can sort of get
23:36 - started and all of this is free so
23:38 - definitely go ahead and check that out
23:41 - when you get a chance yeah yeah yeah and
23:45 - if you anyone has any other suggestion
23:47 - the drop in the comments below and tell
23:49 - us what other cool coding mentor places
23:53 - you go to right now let's say also
23:55 - another thing is like yeah okay so yeah
23:57 - so I think I'm kind of yeah I think
23:59 - those those newsletters there's a
24:01 - JavaScript one in the back one is
24:02 - perfect yeah yeah exactly they're really
24:06 - nice do you wanna actually so guys if
24:08 - you are part of you if you've done this
24:10 - if you've been part of Facebook groups
24:12 - you've been to coding conferences if you
24:13 - subscribe to news as well if you're just
24:15 - more like introverted because a lot of
24:17 - us I get it's uncomfortable to put
24:19 - yourselves in those situations then I
24:21 - would really recommend that you guys
24:22 - just take a minute out to go ahead and
24:24 - check out profiler javascript because
24:27 - this is a community unlike no other
24:29 - not only give them a quick interest of
24:31 - what JavaScript is yeah so so basically
24:34 - maybe I mean show so that's not that's
24:36 - not a thing I want to talk about which
24:38 - is basically the fifth step or the sixth
24:40 - step which is you can join a paid
24:42 - community right so like for example
24:43 - profitable JavaScript which is a
24:46 - community and a course that we've been
24:47 - working on for them for a long time now
24:49 - and then it's they're kind of basically
24:50 - to take you from zero like if you have
24:53 - zero knowledge in just coding in general
24:55 - right it is they take you from zero to
24:57 - be in someone who is able to go and
25:00 - interview with companies like Google
25:01 - Palantir Facebook Twitter and so forth
25:03 - right and what we have is what we
25:05 - honestly build like the easiest way to
25:07 - say yeah it's the ultimate JavaScript
25:10 - course the ultimate web development
25:12 - course - for you to become a web
25:14 - developer right because not only this is
25:16 - not just your normal course whether you
25:18 - know modules and stuff like that but if
25:20 - you scroll down sunny
25:21 - yeah if you scroll down basically what
25:24 - you get is like you get the trainings
25:25 - you get the success coaches you know we
25:27 - have success coaches who you know help
25:29 - you out basically they give you
25:31 - personalized feedback so obviously we
25:32 - have homeworks
25:33 - you know we have training calls by
25:36 - people like who like sunny this guy this
25:38 - guy right here right this guy know this
25:40 - guy so yeah we got by Mazie people like
25:47 - sunny
25:47 - you also got Jakob we also got me I'm
25:50 - kind of you know I'm helping you I'm
25:51 - also teaching as well so you know yeah
25:55 - it's just honestly it's like I don't
25:57 - wanna you know I don't want to sell it
25:58 - too much guys but it's a community where
26:00 - we have a slack community of over
26:02 - thirteen hundred members now and
26:04 - everybody's just help each other out
26:05 - like everybody's there you know to
26:08 - basically to uplift each other you know
26:10 - a monolith for example guys whoever's in
26:12 - profit a JavaScript please drop it in
26:14 - the comments below and just and just
26:16 - explain to everybody on here just how
26:19 - awesome like just so epic like this
26:22 - community is because I've never seen
26:26 - anything like this before I've been in
26:27 - multiple courses and so forth but I
26:29 - think who reason while they decide to
26:31 - create this is simply because it's just
26:32 - that's you know it that's just how good
26:34 - to critically we wanted we wanted this
26:37 - to be different yeah so between the job
26:40 - between the JavaScript coach it goes
26:41 - between the live community
26:43 - this is something this is not something
26:44 - we just get in and then you just watch
26:46 - some videos no we're gonna make you get
26:49 - into it we're gonna make you actually
26:51 - learn this [ __ ] you know we're gonna
26:53 - make you basically exactly we're gonna
26:56 - make you because we want to see success
26:58 - right because you wanna see success and
27:00 - so you wanna we want to basically do the
27:02 - most we can to get you that success so
27:05 - if you're in that category of wine to
27:08 - become developer a successful developer
27:10 - earn a killing with JavaScript it's one
27:12 - of the big things that we teach which is
27:14 - if you can highlight that sunny yeah
27:16 - yeah that earning earning with
27:18 - JavaScript that's a big part
27:19 - differentiates us from you know anybody
27:21 - else anyways yeah that's it that's all I
27:23 - want to say I'm done guys I'm done all I
27:25 - want to say exactly now just what we've
27:26 - had to mention it just wanna highlight
27:28 - that unlike any other soil community out
27:31 - there you're gonna be able to get
27:32 - one-to-one direct access with me and I
27:34 - mean ours Kazi everyone in a slack
27:36 - community so when I mean like literally
27:38 - the minute you join if you're gonna jump
27:40 - on a cool with us it's that simple you
27:41 - literally like the amount of coaching
27:43 - calls that me and Nas jump on every
27:45 - single day with like a student if they
27:47 - need help with a job application or if
27:48 - they need help with something else we're
27:50 - literally there holding your hand
27:52 - through the entire process and we stick
27:54 - the AK student and that's what makes it
27:56 - really really nice yeah so also if you
27:59 - guys do want to check that out the link
28:00 - is in the description and you can go
28:02 - ahead and just have a little little
28:04 - browse awesome yeah and we have some
28:06 - ones I see a question was like I think
28:08 - follow full of wheel Aziz
28:10 - if I join PETA PETA pwj will you help me
28:13 - with some projects like you know and
28:15 - delicate projects yes pretty much we
28:17 - help with any projects like if you got
28:18 - your own projects you posted in the live
28:20 - community people will help you out there
28:22 - you can probably even help people you
28:24 - can help people help you out and you can
28:26 - call us directly like you can call us
28:30 - directly as well and all the time I you
28:32 - know I help students out and you know
28:34 - directly like through zoom and so forth
28:36 - so it's great stuff like seriously like
28:38 - it's just yeah my name is I just want to
28:40 - mention it a lot of people asking how
28:42 - they can go ahead and join you guys you
28:44 - just need to click the link in the
28:45 - description and there's a link in the
28:47 - description where it says click here and
28:49 - then row now and that will take you to
28:50 - the page that we just showed you and
28:52 - everything is on that page for you to go
28:54 - and check out awesome
28:55 - but eautiful eggs
28:56 - exactly so I think out of that let's
28:59 - move on to step two the step to the
29:01 - point two now the second thing I wish I
29:04 - knew when I started program which is
29:05 - what sunny it is getting out of tutorial
29:08 - hell guys so we all know what tutorial
29:10 - how is or if you don't it's basically
29:13 - where you get stuck in this circular
29:16 - pattern of watching YouTube videos
29:18 - coding up these perfect apps but then if
29:21 - I was to ask you a simple question can
29:23 - you build that project from scratch
29:25 - without that tutorial without those
29:28 - lines of code can you do it guys and
29:30 - that is the pattern that we want to get
29:31 - out of so now it's gonna open up a bit
29:33 - more about about what we're talking
29:35 - about here yeah so tell me guys for one
29:38 - is like let us know in the comments if
29:39 - you are in that hell like if you have
29:41 - been in a tutorial hell and you get what
29:43 - we're talking about right if you haven't
29:45 - if you have not been in it like brace
29:48 - yourself brace yourself but I mean you
29:51 - can leak embrace it but what we are
29:54 - trying to get to is like you know too
29:56 - many people well what they was do and
29:58 - let us know if that's you for example is
30:00 - you know you go to youtube tutorials
30:02 - right like okay I got this view tutorial
30:03 - I got this you to tutorial right and
30:05 - you're gonna do one you to the tariqa
30:08 - and do another you to tutorial and so
30:09 - forth and you become addicted to this
30:12 - thing of just kind of following
30:14 - tutorials copying code and not really
30:18 - taking your head as being the
30:20 - directional a directional point of
30:21 - thought yeah what I mean by that is you
30:24 - is you have to now basically use what
30:27 - you learn right to actually now create
30:29 - projects you have to be the one that
30:32 - someone who doesn't just follow
30:34 - tutorials but someone who actually tries
30:37 - to do things on their own from scratch
30:40 - yeah like like like like sunny tell tell
30:44 - me what is a project you build from
30:45 - scratch entirely so a project that I
30:48 - built yeah so an entire project that I
30:51 - built from scratch so what I tended to
30:53 - do actually just to sort of reword that
30:55 - was I used to go ahead and I to would go
30:58 - ahead and look at these sort of these
31:01 - tutorials that you see online but what I
31:02 - would do differently is I would go ahead
31:05 - and I would basically watch your
31:07 - tutorial understand their bar would
31:08 - literally rather than rebuilding that
31:10 - too
31:10 - I would write a list of the fundamentals
31:13 - that they've used order what are the
31:14 - programming principles that they used
31:16 - did they use things like a raise right
31:18 - and if they did use a right can I use an
31:21 - array and like my own project and I
31:22 - would go ahead and make like it so say
31:24 - for example I swore to do app on the
31:25 - screen I would go ahead and make my own
31:27 - to do that but I would not even look at
31:29 - that that to do that right I would
31:31 - actually kind of go ahead
31:33 - write a list of the things that they
31:34 - used to build their one so like arrays
31:36 - how do I get the button when I click the
31:39 - button how do I add that to the list of
31:40 - to do's and then I would actually go
31:42 - ahead and then try and go and even if I
31:45 - didn't understand how to do something
31:48 - how to execute a function on a button
31:50 - click I would go ahead and use Google to
31:52 - then go and find that I wouldn't rely
31:54 - solemnly on that YouTube video and copy
31:56 - at line for line because that's not
31:58 - going to save you guys and that's really
32:00 - gonna actually slow down your
32:01 - development yeah yeah so so how would
32:05 - you go out I get out of YouTube tutorial
32:08 - help Sonny yeah so what I would say is I
32:11 - would recommend don't skip the
32:13 - fundamentals guys so the first thing is
32:15 - the reason why we all get stuck in
32:16 - tutorial how is because it's very it's a
32:20 - very comfortable place right we actually
32:22 - get a lot of satisfaction because in the
32:23 - end of it we get these really nice apps
32:25 - right we get these nice little cool apps
32:27 - which look really nice by onc apps
32:30 - yeah these fancy apps which look really
32:31 - cool and they look nice and we can
32:33 - format our portfolio in this shiny but
32:35 - guys truthfully I I can't tell you
32:38 - enough that like the way to get the way
32:40 - I at least I got out of it was I
32:42 - actually started to just learn the
32:44 - fundamentals and that meant cutting
32:46 - things down to the bare bones like I'm
32:49 - not talking making these fancy front end
32:51 - you eyes and making things look really
32:52 - nice I literally used to make very
32:54 - simple apps but the apps that I knew
32:57 - exactly how they worked I knew exactly
33:00 - why everything worked the way it did I
33:03 - knew exactly like how the data was being
33:05 - moved around the app and and then I
33:07 - would then look at things like API is
33:09 - and stuff like that and it goes a bit
33:10 - deeper but yeah so my number one top tip
33:13 - there is don't skip the fundamentals
33:15 - what about yourself now yeah yeah I
33:18 - would say for me the most important
33:20 - thing honestly to get a you tutorial and
33:22 - I and I feel you like I know you like
33:24 - I know your YouTube toriel help
33:25 - potentially yeah one ways that we
33:28 - actually have our students and the other
33:29 - thing one of the ways that I got out of
33:31 - it is actually like let's say you watch
33:33 - a video right let's say you watch it use
33:35 - it YouTube video right any video and you
33:38 - build the project what our students are
33:40 - doing right now is seriously is they are
33:42 - rebuilding the project by themselves
33:45 - fully so they are rebuilding a project
33:48 - that's part one okay so rebuild a
33:50 - project by yourself meaning do not look
33:52 - at the video do not look at I think you
33:54 - know cheating
33:54 - all right don't cheat okay so literally
33:57 - don't look at the video and then after
33:59 - that after that add your own flavor to
34:02 - it just add your own flavor to it
34:04 - like seriously just be like you know
34:06 - just like okay maybe what else can I add
34:09 - let me maybe add a really cool button
34:11 - maybe I want to add this functionality
34:12 - okay try that out try to add something
34:16 - of your own toast a toast taste changed
34:19 - because I know you are creative I know
34:22 - that you've got it right and simply by
34:26 - just doing that you will start to get
34:28 - into the pattern of actually basically
34:31 - doing things on your own and so then
34:33 - what happens right what happens what
34:35 - happens is that when you start doing
34:37 - things on your own basically you start
34:39 - to build confidence yeah you're like
34:41 - okay well I got this thing done on my
34:43 - own I'm gonna get another thing done on
34:45 - my own and I basically you keep doing it
34:47 - and doing it and doing it and you're
34:48 - like man brain I got anything bring it
34:51 - on you know so like literally that's how
34:54 - I get out of it is like just by honestly
34:56 - you know doing projects and redoing them
34:58 - and and then and any your own taste to
35:01 - it that's very big that's a very big
35:02 - yeah you know a really good comment here
35:05 - from Elijah as we said reading John some
35:08 - as his book helped clarify what I was
35:09 - doing wrong this is actually something
35:11 - me and cause he mentioned in and the
35:12 - other cool the other day so if you guys
35:14 - haven't checked out a book quote John
35:15 - soft skills he actually covers even in
35:18 - that book about development a little bit
35:20 - so when he's not talking about this
35:22 - office goes and he says pretty much like
35:23 - it's all about breaking down things into
35:25 - you the sort of fundamentals right and
35:26 - how he when that was actually in so of
35:28 - the sauce goes approach but you can
35:29 - relate that here in this case as well
35:31 - right like it's just about breaking it
35:33 - down and building that confidence right
35:35 - so literally if we then ask you to like
35:37 - go ahead and do
35:38 - like a small app you can just say yeah
35:39 - sure I can do that no piece of cake and
35:41 - then basically once you do that enough
35:43 - times that app just naturally starts to
35:45 - get bigger that actually starts to
35:47 - become more beautiful looking up and
35:48 - then and then you start to invest in
35:50 - yourself and you can start taking design
35:52 - courses to make it look a little bit
35:53 - nicer and yeah I'm telling you guys it
35:57 - took me a long time before my app side
35:59 - to actually look nice I mean I mean like
36:06 - I think that I think that like yeah it
36:08 - takes time most importanly guys it takes
36:10 - time
36:11 - don't be afraid don't get this cursed
36:12 - cuz a lot of people what ok we'll be
36:14 - like ok well you know a lot of people
36:17 - will be like you know oh I can't get it
36:19 - I can't get it right now so you know I
36:21 - must not be good at it
36:22 - no just keep doing anything that's worth
36:25 - it is gonna take some time and it's
36:27 - going to be hard right so I would say
36:30 - just keep at it right like basically
36:32 - like Sonny said break it down to smaller
36:34 - chunks do things on your own and why do
36:36 - we say do things on your own Sonny
36:39 - why do you think like do things by
36:40 - yourself yeah so I think the reason why
36:43 - I would say to do things by yourself is
36:45 - because we not restart to get dependent
36:48 - on whether it be somebody else doing the
36:50 - work for us or if it'll be literally a
36:51 - YouTube video doing the work for us
36:53 - right what we did free copy and guys
36:55 - what I mean by this is like even when I
36:56 - was teaching the live sessions two or
36:59 - three days ago and even yesterday is
37:00 - cool there's a lot of people asking one
37:02 - comment and it was mainly like can you
37:04 - give me the exact line of code or the
37:06 - exact image URL and at this point you're
37:09 - already missing the the missing the sort
37:11 - of value and sort of the tutorial right
37:13 - because you just want to kind of you
37:15 - shouldn't really care about too much by
37:17 - the image URL right you should write
37:18 - code wait matter what image you pass to
37:21 - it but it's gonna be robust it's gonna
37:23 - be functional and at that point you you
37:26 - start to be confident in knowing what
37:28 - actually the code is doing as opposed to
37:29 - like let me just get that exact line of
37:31 - code so I can put in my portfolio
37:32 - because what's gonna happen guys is
37:34 - you're gonna have this amazing looking
37:36 - portfolio with all of these apps but
37:38 - then say you finally get that
37:40 - conversation with that job employer all
37:42 - right they say to you right tell me
37:44 - about like how I can build this app is
37:46 - this gonna be in a very awkward
37:48 - situation
37:53 - you're gonna be like come on let me
37:55 - first open up my mic github code okay
37:59 - code which you copy basically from
38:01 - someone else and then let's see maybe if
38:03 - I can take a look at it yeah and you're
38:07 - just gonna be saying like scratching
38:08 - your head like I think that guy used
38:11 - this framework I think this means this I
38:16 - think that's what this function is
38:17 - actually doing you know yeah but yeah
38:21 - wait
38:22 - also the reason why is because a lot of
38:23 - people like a lot of students right now
38:25 - now that's you and you're probably in
38:27 - their realm and let me know drop in the
38:29 - comments like if you were in that realm
38:30 - which is you know they can build a
38:32 - project right yeah with some help but
38:36 - when it comes to actually taking an idea
38:38 - from their mind and building it
38:40 - themselves that is the hard part because
38:44 - they don't know that what the process is
38:45 - they don't know where to start right
38:47 - yeah and when you don't know what I
38:49 - started thinking just not gonna start
38:50 - and the only way to get rid of that is
38:53 - simply but just like a like Sonny said
38:56 - starting with small projects I and
38:57 - seeing what your process is when you
38:59 - google small projects bring it up to
39:01 - larger projects and then larger then
39:03 - next thing you know you're building
39:03 - Amazon Facebook and those you bought
39:09 - some pretty big companies right me yeah
39:12 - I mean I worked I worked at a lot of
39:14 - things I've worked at is like startup so
39:15 - I worked at like my first my first
39:18 - company I worked for was like a startup
39:19 - company yeah and and that was a really
39:23 - cool one I just literally threw myself
39:24 - into this company I literally was like
39:26 - guys can I help you out is there any way
39:28 - I can help you out throw myself into it
39:30 - it started I started I started learning
39:31 - with this stuff and linnea within a
39:33 - month I was like I went from like a zero
39:35 - developer to like a pretty much beginner
39:37 - slash developer host yeah and then I got
39:40 - to work with a big company called urban
39:43 - science which was pretty big as well
39:45 - yeah and there that was a that was a
39:47 - whole oh my god that's a whole other
39:49 - story that was pretty cool as well yeah
39:51 - oh yeah so Steve McCatty says I would
39:54 - like to say that even better reasons to
39:56 - learn code you'll be able to work
39:57 - anywhere in the world that's the really
40:00 - good point guys and I can actually vouch
40:02 - for that because I think my
40:05 - job was completely remote guys so it was
40:08 - completely remote so I worked it on a
40:10 - laptop and I had an internet connection
40:11 - yeah it was completely remote so I could
40:13 - literally just go ahead I could fly to
40:15 - the Caribbean if I wanted and I could
40:17 - sit on the beach sipping a piña colada
40:18 - and I could just do my work so like you
40:21 - could always do it here Sonny I know to
40:26 - the to the Caribbean or just go to Bali
40:28 - just you know just coding from there I
40:31 - mean you can just you can do that and
40:33 - you can pretty much and guys that's
40:35 - that's something that's really important
40:37 - and worth mentioning that it say for
40:39 - example most of the time when you see
40:41 - like average salaries so let's go ahead
40:43 - and just pull up like the average salary
40:45 - ever of a reactive element let's go
40:47 - ahead and pull that up I just want to
40:48 - make a point here because I see a lot of
40:50 - people have this sort of question react
40:53 - developer salary and what I want to
40:55 - mention his guys it doesn't matter where
40:57 - you are in the world right so doesn't my
40:59 - waiting are in the world if you are able
41:03 - to sort of work so this is pretty much
41:05 - in tbp so this is GP people I think let
41:09 - me go ahead and get the American one
41:10 - because reactor sure actually sharing
41:13 - the screen though I think the link now
41:15 - so I'm just wanting to think now so okay
41:17 - yeah just go ahead and find this so
41:20 - let's check this one out so Nouveau
41:22 - there we go okay so I'll show you this
41:26 - one so this is for example in in the UK
41:28 - right so 57,000
41:31 - 60,000 is the median right in the UK so
41:34 - let's go ahead and share that so you can
41:36 - see here this is that sort of average
41:38 - salary in the UK for a reactive element
41:41 - actually it's much higher in the states
41:42 - I found so in a state yeah it's about
41:44 - 120 I think is is there yeah can you
41:47 - could you can you check it and you say
41:49 - no yeah so let's go ahead and type in so
41:52 - as to you know it states
41:55 - react developer salary let's go ahead
42:00 - and check that and it's gonna see yep
42:02 - there we go so a hundred and twenty
42:03 - thousand guys is air which reacts a
42:05 - developer salary and the reason why I
42:07 - want to point this out is because this
42:09 - salary guys is not it means that it's
42:12 - yes is the average salary inside in the
42:15 - US
42:15 - right but even if you're based abroad
42:18 - right you can land a US client guys so
42:22 - which means that this salary right here
42:23 - you can get this salary right it does
42:26 - not matter if you are abroad or
42:29 - something like that I've had clients who
42:30 - have been based in the States about
42:32 - clients who have been based elsewhere
42:33 - anymore it really doesn't matter you can
42:35 - actually land this off stuff even if
42:37 - you're aboard it's all down to skill and
42:39 - it's down to so yeah how you build your
42:41 - skill set yeah yeah no it wouldn't be
42:44 - bad being in Bali it just you know
42:45 - sipping a piña colada working you know
42:48 - working on the beach and then being a
42:50 - right developer making that money I'm up
42:53 - for it I'm up for it exactly and now
42:55 - guys we even started doing some crazy
42:56 - automations they're like you can even
42:59 - have like a bunch of your also I will
43:08 - say guys it's like no we're showing you
43:10 - these numbers but don't think that these
43:11 - numbers are gonna come right away yeah
43:13 - it takes time for this stuff right don't
43:15 - be like yo guys you know give me a month
43:17 - I'm gonna make 120 K no no no no that's
43:19 - not how it happens okay yeah it's gonna
43:21 - take some time it's gonna take if maybe
43:23 - a year miss can actually probably more
43:25 - than a year to actually make that money
43:26 - you gonna start you're gonna start much
43:28 - lower and then I gonna get it much
43:30 - higher so but if you're patient and you
43:33 - put in the work you'll get it exactly
43:36 - and I really would stress when I said
43:38 - that guys don't follow the money okay
43:40 - the money comes the money comes and goes
43:42 - everyone's asking if I'm drinking vodka
43:44 - no guys this is just this life gonna be
43:51 - like yeah okay yeah so right now yeah so
44:00 - what we're saying yeah so don't focus on
44:05 - the money guys focus on just spending
44:07 - that time so initially I would actually
44:09 - not even bother with like negotiating
44:11 - too much with your first salary even
44:13 - just get your foot in the door fine cuz
44:15 - litchi that first job is going to
44:18 - actually give you access to those really
44:20 - important first mentors that we spoke
44:22 - about earlier and that's gonna be really
44:24 - where you do start to see your growth
44:26 - actually excel in a very very fast pace
44:29 - where
44:29 - you're gonna be a star and especially
44:30 - when you start doing code reviews that's
44:32 - where you start getting your code gets
44:34 - ripped apart by more senior developers
44:36 - and they say why are you doing this why
44:38 - are you doing that or like what is this
44:40 - that you've written here guys that's
44:41 - really the best way you're gonna learn
44:43 - like that's the best way that I learn
44:45 - and I really believe that it helps push
44:47 - your skill set up I love and now and I
44:50 - would say another thing guys is like
44:51 - it's like please do not be afraid to
44:54 - work for free like so a lot of a lot of
44:56 - people I know you know a lot of people
44:57 - that I know well think okay well no I
44:59 - need to make some money right like when
45:01 - I'm working but actually them you're
45:04 - gonna probably learn a lot more actually
45:06 - if you work for free like I literally
45:09 - had a friend okay here's just here's a
45:10 - little small story I had a friend who
45:12 - worked with me now to work with me but
45:14 - someone I knew and he got a job at a big
45:16 - company right as a beginner developer
45:18 - and there he was Billy some basic things
45:21 - right he was building some basic things
45:23 - you know they were making me would do
45:24 - maybe not so interesting things and six
45:27 - months after the job he comes back to me
45:30 - and says hey Naz I am NOT interested in
45:33 - coding anymore
45:33 - like computer science uninteresting to
45:35 - me anymore right versus versus okay
45:38 - versus I mean I'll take myself as an
45:40 - example cuz I'm you know just like that
45:42 - does just my story like I joined a
45:44 - startup company I read a startup company
45:46 - for two years guys for free okay for
45:51 - completely free while also going to
45:53 - college okay
45:55 - well also go to college and there that
45:58 - is what skyrocketed every skyrocketed
46:00 - everything for me that is the reason why
46:02 - I was able to get a job at urban science
46:04 - and as the reason why God was able to
46:05 - get an interview at companies like
46:07 - Google Palantir Twitter squarespace Khan
46:11 - Academy right that is the reason why I
46:13 - was able to make Sony amazing
46:14 - connections right there is a reason why
46:16 - I got my leadership skills I don't want
46:17 - to like say I don't I don't want to feel
46:20 - like a bragging right of that but I just
46:21 - I want to set an example that you know
46:24 - by going the route of potentially even
46:27 - you know working for free you will get
46:29 - to learn a lot more than you think you
46:31 - know so that that is like you know a lot
46:34 - of people cause of you like you know I
46:35 - don't want to I don't want to work for
46:36 - you like I should be making some money
46:38 - but you know what
46:40 - like just
46:42 - do it honestly try it exactly and guys
46:45 - it's like a really good comment here it
46:47 - says software development isn't just a
46:48 - career it's a lifestyle so you can't
46:50 - just switch on and I n'aime switch off
46:52 - for five PM you really do want to kind
46:53 - of think like that you want to have
46:54 - start making it like more of a lifestyle
46:56 - as opposed to you just sort of career
46:58 - oriented and all about the money like
47:00 - now said the value is not gonna be in
47:02 - your paycheck it's gonna be in those
47:04 - hours that you spend debugging and I'm
47:07 - working with other people and even your
47:08 - social skills like it really really is
47:11 - what's gonna make you the difference
47:13 - between a sort of average developer and
47:15 - somebody who stands out from the crowd
47:17 - literally the guy that can have a
47:18 - personality as well as have all the
47:20 - skills in coding and things like that
47:22 - that guy is gonna go a hell of a lot
47:23 - further even if another guy is more
47:25 - technically capable than that the first
47:27 - guy so you saw those soft skills and
47:29 - that personality really do come through
47:31 - yeah exactly as I could chase chase the
47:34 - experience not the paycheck exactly
47:36 - definitely so I think Naz with that said
47:40 - that gets number two off the list over
47:44 - to number three let's do it
47:48 - let's go so number three a job for drop
47:51 - in alright number three let's go drop it
47:54 - in number three is just start and please
48:00 - stop overthinking okay I get so many
48:04 - questions guys and tell me this if
48:05 - you're if you're like if you're you know
48:07 - kind of confused on where to start if
48:10 - you're confused on what language to
48:12 - start out with right the amount of
48:13 - questions that we probably me and Sonny
48:16 - and kasi and Jacob yet in terms of hey
48:19 - what is the first language I should go
48:20 - with or hey what computer shall I get or
48:23 - hey you know just like what framework
48:25 - should I start with and what is our
48:28 - answer Sonny to always always to that
48:29 - what is our answer just pick one and
48:32 - just start with it my one that I would
48:34 - recommend guys is JavaScript I think you
48:36 - should just pick JavaScript but just
48:38 - whatever else just please pick one and
48:40 - start with it don't hop from one to the
48:42 - other and next then the tomorrow you're
48:44 - doing a different language pick one and
48:46 - just stick with it guys and really put
48:48 - all of your effort into learning that
