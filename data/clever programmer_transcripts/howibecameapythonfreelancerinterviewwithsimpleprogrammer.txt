00:56 - especially as we head into you know 2020
00:59 - and all the way to 2030 things are going
01:01 - to a I and lots of programming what are
01:04 - the job opportunities that exist and we
01:06 - cover all of that and much more so I

01:23 - today I've got a good friend of mine
01:24 - Kazi from clever programmer and he's
01:27 - putting on a special class a Python
01:30 - master class that it's really
01:32 - interesting and I wanted to just take a
01:34 - moment you guys thanks for checking this
01:36 - out it's gonna be totally worth your

01:46 - attention and stay to the end of this
01:48 - video because we've got some really
01:50 - valuable information here especially if
01:52 - you've ever wanted to become a Python
01:55 - developer if you've wanted to do
01:56 - freelancing work become a freelancer you
01:59 - know get out on your own and make a
02:01 - living for yourself without working for
02:03 - someone else or even if you just want to
02:04 - make some money on the side you know
02:06 - there's there's some huge earning
02:08 - potentials up to making like 300 bucks
02:11 - an hour
02:11 - as a freelance
02:12 - a Python developer and I've got the
02:14 - expert here Kazi who's done it all whose
02:17 - coach people doing this so so welcome
02:20 - Kazi hey thanks for having me John
02:22 - so so Kazi what what's what's going on
02:26 - man I wanted to I wanted to you know
02:29 - really when you're telling me about this
02:31 - I was I was pretty excited and I wanted
02:33 - to let everyone know about this but um
02:36 - you know I gotta ask you like you know
02:38 - I'm a c-sharp developer so why should
02:41 - why should people become Python
02:43 - developers I like c-sharp what's what's
02:45 - the why is it Python getting so damn
02:47 - popular right now absolutely man so
02:49 - python is the the feud there are a few
02:52 - amazing things that I love about Python
02:55 - and that are just true about Python in
02:58 - general so for example it's one of the
03:00 - easiest programming languages it's one
03:03 - of the fastest-growing programming
03:05 - languages so even as data science is
03:08 - growing and data analytics is growing by
03:10 - 2012 believe by 2030 forbes has
03:13 - predicted that you know 800 million jobs
03:17 - are gonna be given to AI so for example
03:21 - even lift right now has self-driving
03:22 - cars pretty soon uber is gonna have them
03:24 - and a lot of that is run off of Python
03:27 - even recently - early detected a black
03:30 - hole and took a picture of it that was
03:34 - done with pythons you know and Netflix
03:39 - just released an article a few days ago
03:41 - where they shared that every film every
03:44 - movie that you actually watch is being
03:47 - powered by Python in the backend so you
03:51 - know things like Instagram are built off
03:52 - of it YouTube is built off of it so it
03:56 - has so much potential and it's only
03:58 - growing so and that is why I prefer and
04:02 - just recommend wholeheartedly going
04:05 - Python okay okay some pretty good
04:07 - arguments and I guess that's you know
04:10 - it's interesting I see all that like the
04:12 - artificial intelligence stuff seems to
04:14 - be in Python like image recognition like
04:16 - pie image and all that stuff is so it
04:19 - makes a lot of sense that you know it
04:21 - seems like a lot of the really the AI
04:24 - and machine learning in all of
04:26 - his his Python and that's that's where
04:29 - we're going in the future but well what
04:31 - about free beginner see that's the thing
04:32 - is like you know if someone's getting
04:34 - started in software development is is
04:37 - Python the easy is it an easy language
04:40 - for them to learn yeah so perfect python
04:44 - is at one of the easiest programming
04:46 - languages to learn and if you look at
04:49 - all the universities right and you
04:51 - actually look at their statistics and
04:53 - data all of them are switching over from
04:55 - Java or any other programming language
04:58 - to Python so okay so you'll see like all
05:02 - these universities switching over to
05:03 - Python primarily because of how simple
05:05 - it is but it's not but you can't think
05:09 - it's so simple it's not that it's not
05:10 - powerful you know its deceptively simple
05:12 - but it's still powerful so people from
05:15 - again like Instagram to NASA scientists
05:18 - are using Python you know on their day
05:21 - to day base so if you're a complete
05:23 - beginner that's perfect you'll be able
05:25 - to pick it up really quickly and then
05:28 - the great thing about it is as a
05:29 - developer it allows you to be maximally
05:32 - productive so then actually you can just
05:34 - go on to get freelancing clients build
05:37 - projects as fast as possible and it lets
05:42 - you use all of the you know its
05:44 - batteries included so to speak so it
05:47 - lets you leverage all of its libraries
05:49 - and tools to build real-world projects
05:52 - really really fast that way you earn
05:54 - your income your client gets your
05:56 - results both parties are happy okay okay
05:59 - I see okay so that makes sense I mean if
06:01 - it's something that's easy to learn and
06:03 - then it has a very high potential you
06:06 - know down the road then it's a good path
06:08 - to be on especially now no what about
06:11 - freelancing right because I know this is
06:13 - one of the things that you're really
06:14 - gonna cover in this masterclass it's not
06:16 - just you know it's not just about
06:18 - learning to become a Python developer
06:20 - but it's also about you know becoming a
06:23 - freelancer and making money freelancing
06:26 - what you know why freelancing why not
06:28 - just get the regular job yep so that's a
06:31 - great question for me honestly it was I
06:34 - wanted to become a remote developer I
06:36 - wanted to do freelancing because I had
06:39 - to be when I was
06:40 - growing up and I used to live with my
06:43 - mom so I wanted to be able to be near my
06:45 - mom and help her a lot because she was
06:47 - oftentimes sick or my dad wouldn't be
06:49 - there and he was in Afghanistan you know
06:51 - as a military and he was doing
06:54 - translation so for me it was really
06:57 - important to be able to do something
07:00 - where I could be near my family and
07:01 - still earn an income and not be bounded
07:05 - by anything then I came to discover that
07:07 - there are a lot of other benefits like
07:08 - being able to work on my own hours right
07:12 - exactly yeah and be able to work with
07:15 - the type of clients that I actually
07:17 - enjoy working with and not necessarily
07:20 - have one boss I remember I read your
07:22 - book many years ago as the soft skills
07:26 - and you had you talked about this one
07:29 - concept which is which sticks to me till
07:31 - this day which is if you should look at
07:34 - a job like it's just one client right
07:37 - yeah exactly yeah it's one big client
07:40 - but it's still one client so your
07:44 - business in a sense is really weak if
07:46 - you look at yourself like a business so
07:49 - if you actually go to the freelancing
07:52 - route where you start to have multiple
07:54 - clients now you have a really really
07:56 - strong business you have freedom to
07:59 - choose your own hours you have freedom
08:01 - to choose who you work with you can
08:04 - travel and most importantly be around
08:07 - the people that you love so that's why I
08:09 - am such a big proponent of freelancing
08:12 - okay okay yeah yeah I agree with all of
08:15 - that you know I did freelancing for a
08:17 - while and you know I mean I was
08:19 - eventually able to build like $300 an
08:21 - hour as a freelancer and I thought that
08:23 - was just it was insane I couldn't
08:25 - believe that that was possible and I was
08:27 - working these regular jobs for such a
08:29 - long time but now I had this freedom and
08:31 - the heck I could work like if I wanted
08:33 - to twenty hours a week and make more
08:35 - money than then I was making when I was
08:37 - making working 40 hours a week yes yes
08:40 - so guys also I want to let you know like
08:42 - Kazi mentioned soft skills it's kind of
08:45 - interesting we have we just met up in LA
08:47 - for the first time about about a couple
08:50 - weeks ago and it was kind of cool to
08:52 - like see his story if you guys have been
08:54 - fall
08:54 - if not you know you should definitely
08:55 - check out his his stuff on clever
08:58 - programmer but he was telling me about
09:00 - how he first read soft skills and how
09:03 - that kind of really launched him in this
09:05 - direction and he's build up this awesome
09:07 - Empire you know a huge YouTube channel
09:09 - the awesome courses like doing
09:12 - everything right and building this
09:14 - business and like so it's just an
09:16 - example you know of what what can what
09:19 - can happen and so that's why that's why
09:20 - I also guy said I'm you know it's not
09:23 - just that that I'm that I'm trying to
09:26 - get you to sign up for this masterclass
09:28 - right because I think there's a huge
09:30 - benefit in it but also the thing is like
09:33 - this is someone that I trust right Kazi
09:35 - because he's implemented what I wrote in
09:38 - soft skills and he's made it work so
09:40 - he's actually taking the action and done
09:42 - that so I think he's just a great
09:43 - example of someone to to listen to and
09:46 - follow because he's actually done the
09:47 - steps right he's not just you know it's
09:49 - sometimes I think you guys think oh well
09:52 - you know some like John is just an
09:53 - outlier and it's you know anyone can do
09:56 - this if they're willing to take those
09:57 - steps so right there you go
10:00 - yeah I hundred percent agree I think
10:03 - ultimately it comes down to choices I
10:05 - think it's just as hard and just as
10:08 - equally easy working McDonald's versus
10:10 - charging 300 dollars as a Python
10:11 - consultant I think it's just as easy to
10:14 - work a minimum-wage job as it is to even
10:16 - start your own business so ultimately it
10:19 - comes down to what choices do you like
10:23 - what choices do you make right that's
10:25 - what defines your path in your direction
10:28 - like for example I could just pick up a
10:30 - can of soda and drink it right now or
10:32 - just as easily I could pick up water and
10:34 - drink it right in that time they're both
10:36 - really easy and like you know you and I
10:38 - were sitting in a lane you were like
10:39 - always think five years ahead if you
10:42 - think five years ahead where do you need
10:44 - to invest your time to get the maximum
10:46 - return and oftentimes it's actually not
10:49 - in doing the easy things it's right
10:51 - sometimes doing you know going after the
10:54 - harder thing so you know if you choose
10:57 - to go down this route of trying to
10:59 - become a freelancer sometimes initially
11:01 - it seems harder because oh man the job
11:05 - one client and I'm making
11:08 - decay 60 K maybe more but with freelance
11:12 - saying that might not be happening right
11:15 - in the start but if you actually decide
11:17 - to do this and I think the right way to
11:20 - do it is don't quit your job if your
11:22 - Avella per first replace your income
11:25 - like first either start generating side
11:27 - income or replace your income and now
11:30 - you have the choice to quit your job but
11:33 - and the end what you'll have is freedom
11:36 - and I think that is what's truly
11:37 - priceless right and even if someone
11:39 - didn't want to like you know if
11:41 - someone's listening in there they're
11:43 - happy they like their developer job
11:45 - right but maybe they want to make some
11:47 - extra income on the side or maybe they
11:49 - just want to work on projects that are
11:50 - fun right that was one of the things
11:51 - like I think that pulled me into doing
11:53 - some freelancing is like yeah I like the
11:55 - corporate job and stuff but I want to
11:57 - work with this new cool technology right
11:59 - in fact I think one of the first
12:00 - freelancing things I did was I really
12:02 - like creating automation frameworks and
12:04 - doing iOS development and I couldn't
12:05 - really do that my job so you know that
12:08 - it's a good way to make some extra
12:09 - income and then you can kind of decide
12:11 - maybe you're making it not so much
12:12 - income from the freelancing which is
12:14 - what happened to me that you quit your
12:15 - job and then you just do that full time
12:17 - so maybe you don't even have it planned
12:18 - but hey you know keep making enough
12:20 - money to cover your mortgage every month
12:22 - that's it's like living for free that's
12:25 - right that's a great way to look at it
12:27 - you can yeah if you cover your expenses
12:28 - or your mortgage or your rent I think
12:32 - that is a great thing to be able to do
12:34 - with it too because then everything you
12:36 - make from your job is essentially close
12:38 - to pure profit cool cool okay well yeah
12:42 - we should talk a little bit about what's
12:43 - what's gonna be in the master class oh
12:45 - by the way guys I did want to tell you I
12:47 - just remembered when we went up to LA
12:49 - this guy Kazi he's he's a power lifter
12:52 - so you know not only is he you know
12:54 - super smart developer and and can teach
12:57 - you everything about freelancing but he
12:59 - lives life he lives the simple
13:00 - programmer he can also kick your ass you
13:07 - know I talk about lifestyle of not being
13:10 - the typical nerd I know a lot of you you
13:12 - follow me because that's that's you and
13:14 - you know Kazi Kazi is one of us so but
13:17 - let's talk about the master class so so
13:19 - why should people sign up for this what
13:20 - are you gonna give them in
13:22 - right you know I know so my god I don't
13:24 - really need to learn Python or I'm not
13:26 - sure if I wanna be a freelance developer
13:27 - but why should they you know just like
13:30 - stick around and just at least check out
13:31 - this master class so many reasons so
13:34 - many reasons first of all this class is
13:36 - just epic like it's just so entertaining
13:39 - to watch but more importantly if we look
13:43 - at the really valuable stuff that you
13:44 - get out of it is that it shows you your
13:46 - Python earning potential so even if you
13:49 - are just mildly curious about this right
13:53 - going into it and really knowing what
13:55 - type of realistically what type of
13:58 - earning potential you could have based
14:00 - on the number of clients based on a
14:02 - certain number of hours and I even give
14:05 - you a downloadable worksheet essentially
14:07 - which is plug and play so you can get
14:10 - your own sheet and see how much you're
14:13 - earning income potential is at which
14:15 - point you could look at it and go I
14:17 - think I want to pursue this or you could
14:19 - go I don't think I want to pursue this
14:21 - okay okay so definitely they should at
14:24 - least like in fact right now if you're
14:26 - watching go sign up now you can finish
14:28 - watching the video after you sign up but
14:30 - otherwise you're not gonna get this
14:31 - calculator and yeah you should
14:33 - definitely at least find that out right
14:35 - even if you don't watch anything else at
14:36 - least if you know what your potential is
14:38 - you owe that to yourself otherwise
14:40 - you're just you're just closing a door
14:42 - that's that's right and the most
14:44 - important thing I want to say about this
14:46 - entire masterclass it really paves the
14:48 - way and makes it super clear for you how
14:51 - to go from zero to becoming a six-figure
14:54 - developer now if you're already halfway
14:56 - there
14:56 - then the concepts are gonna be even
14:59 - easier for you to understand right it
15:01 - really creates a clear step-by-step
15:04 - roadmap and we give you a calculator
15:08 - that you can take away we give you a
15:11 - downloadable roadmap that is gonna be
15:15 - essentially yours and we give you a
15:18 - downloadable portfolio so worst case
15:20 - scenario you leave with the portfolio
15:22 - that can potentially help you land jobs
15:24 - this is a tested and proven portfolio
15:27 - you get a road map that you can use so
15:30 - even if you just come out of curiosity
15:32 - to download these things I believe that
15:35 - you're still
15:35 - gonna find a lot of value in this right
15:38 - exactly and this master Gus is totally
15:40 - free right oh yeah it's totally free
15:42 - that's right okay so yeah there's really
15:44 - no reason to not not check this out
15:46 - so so yeah so guys definitely you know
15:49 - click sign up make sure before you miss
15:51 - this opportunity because I don't know if
15:53 - this is gonna be offered again and I
15:55 - know there's some huge value here so
15:57 - what else what other kind of surprises
15:59 - the bonus you said it's entertaining was
16:01 - it entertaining so it's I mean it's shot
16:04 - it's really high-quality it was made
16:06 - with a lot of love and passion so just
16:09 - the quality of it is great and you will
16:11 - find a lot of you know there's some
16:13 - funny moments in it but most importantly
16:16 - I show you not just like the nerdy stuff
16:18 - to go from you know one point to another
16:22 - point but actually show you real world
16:25 - tangible projects that you can develop
16:27 - and for example I share with you my
16:30 - first twenty thousand dollar contract
16:32 - that I don't know is okay actually share
16:34 - with you the invoice I shared with you
16:37 - the exact first project I built to make
16:39 - my twenty thousand dollars I share with
16:42 - you how I charged one of my clients how
16:44 - I went from fifty dollars two hundred
16:46 - dollars an hour
16:48 - nice right so those are all really
16:50 - tangible things that you get out of
16:53 - watching this because I don't think a
16:55 - lot of people are sharing that I don't
16:58 - think a lot of people are sharing
16:59 - specifically the project that they built
17:01 - and specifically how much they got paid
17:03 - I also shared with you how you know
17:05 - within my first year I actually went
17:07 - from zero to making a hundred and four
17:09 - thousand dollars a year as a Python
17:11 - freelancer like complete beginner just
17:14 - actually started learning programming
17:16 - and I skipped a lot of steps because I
17:20 - had lots of mentors mm-hm
17:22 - and that's essentially what we want to
17:24 - be able to help you do as well like just

18:18 - thanks for having me John yeah what
18:21 - would it mean for you if you made your
18:23 - first $1,000 from coding what would it
18:26 - mean for you if I reveal to you my step
18:28 - by step system that I use to go from
18:32 - being completely broke to then learning
18:35 - how to code in just a few months landing
18:37 - my contract as a freelancer with Python
18:40 - and being able to make twenty thousand
