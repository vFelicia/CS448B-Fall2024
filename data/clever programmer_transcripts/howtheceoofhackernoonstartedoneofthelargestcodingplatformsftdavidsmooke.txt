01:15 - introduce us just a little bit more

01:18 - hacker noon and and so forth
01:21 - cool yeah my name is david smook i'm 33
01:24 - years old
01:24 - living in colorado i run a remote
01:27 - company called hackernoon
01:28 - we have about 12 full-time employees and
01:31 - another 20
01:32 - part-time employees we primarily employ
01:35 - editors and software developers we
01:38 - publish about
01:39 - uh 40 stories a day ranging across all
01:42 - types of technology
01:43 - so software development coding
01:45 - programming that's a big pillar of ours
01:47 - as well as startups business and then
01:49 - also the decentralized movement and the
01:51 - movement towards
01:53 - web 3.0 i spend a lot of my day
01:56 - uh building software so i'm more of a
01:58 - product management side of things
02:01 - editing stories uh kind of solving the
02:04 - worst problems whatever kind of funnels
02:06 - to me
02:06 - about the business is always like you
02:08 - know the the fun part of that job
02:10 - um you know doing some sales um
02:14 - you know trying to work more with great
02:16 - technology companies and uh
02:17 - making a we really want to just make a
02:19 - better place to publish
02:20 - so the relationship we have with
02:22 - contributors is they own their content
02:25 - they bring it to hacker noon
02:26 - we provide editing and distribution for
02:28 - those stories and we build up a library
02:30 - and our readership and we have about
02:31 - three million readers a month wow and
02:33 - we're building a lot of software wow
02:36 - that's beautifully beautiful
02:37 - and so i know you talked a little bit a
02:39 - little bit about hackernoon and what you
02:41 - guys
02:42 - you know are doing and tell me a little
02:43 - bit more about what was the goal with
02:45 - hackernet or like
02:46 - what is the premise of hackernoon you
02:48 - know info for those people who might not
02:50 - know hacking
02:51 - maybe who haven't heard about it uh tell
02:53 - us like what is your goal and
02:54 - what will the readers get out of it well
02:58 - the original goal was to make a business
03:00 - that made money while i slept
03:01 - okay spot in my career where i really
03:04 - didn't want to uh be paid by the hour
03:06 - and working salary is still
03:08 - in my mind by the hour you know you
03:09 - don't own the work you're doing you
03:11 - don't own
03:11 - any of the upside or very little of it
03:13 - so i kind of reached a point in my
03:15 - career where
03:16 - like that was more my goal than saying
03:18 - hey i need to solve this problem or that
03:20 - problem or anything like that
03:22 - it was more as a mindset of like i
03:23 - needed to figure out a way to make a
03:25 - business that
03:25 - provides value it makes revenue and pays
03:28 - rent and
03:29 - it makes more than it spends so a lot of
03:30 - like the early days of this stuff was
03:33 - not about
03:34 - making the best place for technologists
03:35 - to publish you know that
03:37 - that wasn't where it started as the goal
03:38 - but we found a nice niche
03:40 - around building a lot of sites um so i
03:42 - was building like
03:44 - blog licensing sites blogs and different
03:46 - verticals really
03:47 - you know getting into content management
03:49 - systems and um
03:51 - at my previous job i you know ran a
03:53 - wordpress blog with about 500
03:55 - contributors so i had gone through kind
03:57 - of the back and forth of like
03:58 - how to manage a large network of
04:00 - contributors how to help with their work
04:01 - all the flow stuff
04:03 - so um that's kind of a lot where my
04:05 - background came and with
04:06 - hacker noon i mean it was that right mix
04:08 - of like a good name
04:10 - a good industry the people in technology
04:13 - they know they want to talk about their
04:14 - technology and find other people who
04:16 - care about this stuff
04:17 - right so there's a really good industry
04:19 - for much more of a community-based
04:21 - operation and then putting things in
04:23 - place to improve the content
04:25 - and making your stories better like the
04:26 - headline itself is going to change the
04:28 - whole trajectory of the story
04:30 - how fast it loads is going to change it
04:32 - what the future images
04:33 - how many grammar errors you have how
04:36 - good is your word choice you know
04:37 - all these things impact the direction of
04:39 - the core of the story so it's kind of
04:41 - we found a nice niche of what i'm
04:42 - calling the second human rule of making
04:45 - sure another human views it and improves
04:46 - the content
04:47 - and that's something that i think the
04:49 - internet as a whole is lacking a bit
04:50 - there's so many places anyone can post
04:52 - anything and just shout into whatever
04:54 - other void
04:55 - opens up at the time right having that
04:57 - barrier to entry and saying hey
04:59 - a human's going to look at it it's going
05:00 - to take a couple days and then we're
05:01 - going to get a better result because we
05:03 - had
05:03 - two humans and editing is something that
05:05 - gets a little bit of diminishing returns
05:07 - the first 20 minutes of editing story
05:09 - you're going to provide more value than
05:11 - the next 20 minutes
05:12 - really usually so like the the first 20
05:14 - minutes biscuit that the
05:16 - you know the students read or people
05:17 - read when you say 20 minutes you mean
05:19 - like what's that like
05:20 - what two paragraphs your paragraph so
05:22 - what do you mean by that how an editor
05:24 - can edit like a 500 word story in about
05:26 - 20 minutes
05:27 - you know they kind of come up with the
05:29 - basics and improve it but whenever they
05:30 - spend minutes 21 to 40
05:32 - you know sometimes it's they're not as
05:34 - big of improvements yeah like yeah
05:36 - covering your bases is like the very
05:38 - first thing you need to do and also just
05:39 - answering the question like should this
05:41 - be on the internet forever
05:42 - that's important thing of like maybe
05:44 - someone's like no that shouldn't be on
05:45 - the internet forever or like
05:46 - hey reframe it as a different type of
05:48 - thing and a lot more people are going to
05:50 - care about it or find it you know so
05:51 - there's
05:52 - elements there that like an editor is
05:54 - just so helpful for publishing content
05:56 - on the internet
05:56 - that's true that's true so my
05:58 - interesting portion that you know from
06:00 - what you said there is
06:01 - but then by the way before we go into it
06:03 - fully guys if you do guys want to go and
06:05 - check out hackernoon
06:06 - you know we have the links down in the
06:07 - description there's a hacker on the web
06:09 - so you guys can go to and check out what
06:10 - they have they said
06:11 - they have some amazing articles you know
06:13 - around coding or development around the
06:15 - new
06:15 - you know the new uh web you know a
06:18 - decentralized web as well so
06:20 - you guys do you guys have a newsletter
06:22 - or like uh in there as well which they
06:23 - can subscribe to too
06:25 - oh yeah so if you sign up you can choose
06:27 - your tags as you go
06:28 - and so we can because our library is
06:30 - pretty big we have about 75 000 stories
06:32 - and 27 000 tags
06:34 - nice so it's helpful to uh sign up
06:36 - create an account and then you can pick
06:37 - your eight tags so you can customize
06:39 - your content
06:40 - um yeah and then the footer of every
06:42 - page is a newsletter
06:43 - that's kind of what the general that's
06:45 - beautiful that's beautiful
06:47 - so let me let me ask you this right
06:48 - because when you said it was really
06:49 - interesting when i asked you
06:50 - hey you know what inspired you first to
06:53 - start this and you're like well at first
06:54 - i just wanted to you know
06:56 - uh sit at home not do anything and just
06:58 - have to make money for me right
06:59 - so like that i needed to make money
07:03 - it has to pass the i get hit by a bus
07:04 - rule
07:06 - if it doesn't pass the i get hit by a
07:07 - bus rule and it survives
07:09 - it's not yes you're running your
07:11 - services you're selling your services
07:13 - you're selling your time
07:14 - and that's cool like that's a good way
07:15 - to do it you can make plenty of money
07:17 - but
07:17 - it really needed to solve the rule of
07:19 - like if i'm not a part of it it still
07:20 - works
07:21 - and that's the spot i wanted to get to
07:23 - so let me ask you that right because
07:24 - there's a lot of
07:25 - students i talk to so of course i still
07:27 - i talk to a lot of students on a daily
07:28 - basis you know
07:29 - students who want to learn coding
07:31 - students who want to get into booth
07:33 - camps and stuff like that
07:35 - and there's a lot of people who say you
07:36 - know i just want to you know be on the
07:37 - beach and
07:38 - and make a ton of money and that's it
07:41 - doesn't actually work that way is it
07:42 - actually
07:43 - possible to create something where you
07:45 - literally do nothing and then it's just
07:47 - making money by itself
07:49 - well i mean first and foremost i
07:50 - couldn't do the beach thing my brain's
07:52 - not wired that way
07:53 - like i'm not a beach person like trying
07:55 - to sell someone something on the beach
07:57 - or like
07:58 - you know once i get there i'm like
07:59 - finding a new thing to do so like
08:01 - just chilling on the beach like i
08:03 - probably couldn't handle that
08:04 - that's just kind of out um but
08:09 - that's funny uh what was the question
08:13 - wait so the ques so the question is is
08:14 - it actually possible right
08:16 - to um not not saying beach but actually
08:19 - to
08:20 - make money in your sleep right to where
08:23 - okay
08:23 - other people are doing things i mean
08:25 - with hacker noon that little yellow
08:26 - banner atop every page
08:28 - is about half our revenue and it's
08:30 - running all the time
08:32 - and so we sell it directly to large tech
08:33 - companies and large crypto companies
08:36 - they buy directly from us there's no
08:37 - targeting and we just put that ad
08:39 - up and when i go to sleep people can
08:41 - send you to visit the site have an
08:42 - impression click the ad that's right so
08:44 - that i mean
08:45 - i would say it's happening and it's
08:46 - possible um that's great it's not a
08:48 - full-on money machine it's not like the
08:50 - fed
08:51 - i can't just print money you know
08:52 - whenever i want um
08:54 - but it's a decent business
08:57 - that's good that's good that's good so
08:59 - now let me tell you let me ask this
09:00 - right you
09:01 - you had this goal in mind right that you
09:04 - wanted to
09:05 - be able to not be on the clock and so
09:07 - forth
09:08 - um at which point did it switch to a
09:11 - different model or
09:12 - at which point did you realize that you
09:14 - know this is a lot more than just a
09:17 - business of you know being able to
09:20 - make money while you sleep it came to
09:22 - more of a you know what this is actually
09:23 - a business of actually helping
09:24 - developers and making one of the biggest
09:26 - platforms oh where did you realize that
09:30 - um i don't know there's exactly one day
09:32 - um so it was kind of weaning down my
09:34 - clients
09:35 - so i took on clients to help grow their
09:37 - internet presence and define who they
09:39 - are and
09:40 - you know just help them grow up on the
09:41 - internet and so i had you know this kind
09:43 - of service business and the goal was
09:45 - that the
09:46 - the business from hacker noon would you
09:48 - know outgrow it so it's like it took
09:50 - uh the first customer was actually
09:51 - hired.com the website takeover for the
09:54 - site yeah
09:55 - bought our newsletter and they did all
09:56 - this stuff and um so then it was like
09:58 - okay now i can wean off a couple clients
10:00 - it was the goal was to get off all the
10:02 - other clients that required anything
10:03 - that wasn't hacker noon
10:05 - and that hit um it took about 15
10:08 - 17 months something like that for
10:10 - hackernoon to make enough revenue to be
10:12 - my full-time job
10:13 - um and then i recruited my wife which
10:16 - was probably the smartest
10:18 - move she's much more intelligent than i
10:21 - am
10:22 - uh you know she didn't pay for any
10:23 - education she was sponsored from
10:25 - education from like full scholarships
10:27 - from like age 12 to 21.
10:29 - oh my god
10:33 - so much smarter than me so i guess that
10:35 - was a great pick in terms of
10:36 - you know
10:37 - [Laughter]
10:40 - and then i had people that were kind of
10:41 - in and out of the project uh an
10:43 - engineer jay zalowicz was running a lot
10:45 - of scripts and then
10:47 - um john marshall was doing a lot of
10:48 - writing with me so it's kind of having
10:50 - these part-time people like floating
10:51 - around
10:52 - because they believed in it and helping
10:53 - it grow and exist um
10:55 - and then when it was enough money for
10:57 - the two of us it was a really nice spot
10:58 - so we were
11:00 - we didn't have a software team we were
11:01 - just managing a large community
11:03 - and we were doing a lot of editing a lot
11:05 - of sales and then we wanted to really
11:07 - expand to have our own software team and
11:09 - that's kind of where
11:10 - um yeah that's where we i guess we were
11:13 - going all in and going a little bigger
11:15 - and we did uh something called equity
11:17 - crowd funding
11:19 - i actually remember that i remember that
11:22 - so we did that and that's how we built
11:23 - our first software team and the first
11:25 - uh two engineers three engineers we
11:27 - hired none of them went to college
11:28 - they were all self-learned uh online
11:31 - [ __ ]
11:31 - boot camps all that stuff and just
11:33 - building products so like
11:35 - you know i definitely like what you guys
11:36 - are doing and it's like i think more and
11:37 - more
11:38 - people are not valuing the education
11:40 - when they're hiring software developers
11:42 - which is like
11:43 - it really matt like we've pivoted a lot
11:46 - where we basically
11:47 - every software developer we hire we do a
11:49 - part-time project with them
11:50 - wow really working yeah and we pay them
11:53 - for the project
11:54 - we we talk about it we pick something we
11:56 - think would both be interesting
11:57 - and then we work from there about
11:59 - negotiating like a long-term contract
12:01 - and it's just like so quickly we learn
12:03 - like
12:04 - what people say in an interview doesn't
12:06 - matter
12:08 - what what do you mean by that like to me
12:10 - the interview
12:11 - like i yeah i just every time i try and
12:14 - base a decision on the interview
12:15 - i think i make a poor hiring decision
12:18 - like if i just look at their work and
12:19 - then do a project with them i can see
12:21 - how they work
12:22 - and at that point i'm like i know who
12:23 - i'm working with i kind of understand
12:25 - how they approach a problem how they
12:27 - divide it uh how they time it
12:29 - how they line it up so there's um i
12:32 - don't know where i got to this point but
12:34 - this is this is really this is actually
12:35 - really interesting i'm very happy
12:37 - at this point because you know a lot of
12:39 - our viewers are developers they're
12:40 - beginner developers they're looking to
12:42 - get into companies right
12:43 - and you know i think what you talk about
12:46 - is great because this gives a lot of
12:47 - great insight about what companies are
12:49 - actually looking for
12:51 - right yeah so when you go ahead let me
12:52 - ask you this when you go ahead and
12:54 - hire hiring developers now at this point
12:56 - right um
12:57 - what specifically do you look for and
13:00 - how does the process go
13:01 - yeah so the the last process we did we
13:04 - um
13:05 - put it we put the uh we stopped
13:07 - advertising jobs elsewhere we just put
13:09 - the careers page atop our site because
13:11 - that meant they were a hacker noon
13:12 - reader and they already understood what
13:13 - the site was so
13:14 - they want to work on it that's
13:15 - interesting that was one thing i
13:16 - realized that gets rid of the people
13:18 - that don't care about this
13:19 - so if you if you don't already care
13:21 - about hacker noon it's much harder to
13:23 - do anything with you because you're
13:24 - that's just a you're not already aligned
13:26 - so just that already aligned the people
13:28 - that would i would be talking to
13:30 - uh then we ran um a one and a half hour
13:33 - test that
13:34 - anyone could take and it basically said
13:36 - rebuild a page of hacker noon and we
13:37 - gave them a story
13:39 - yeah so like the story page and some
13:41 - guidance and it can be done in like
13:43 - hour hour and a half maybe two it
13:45 - depends you know how into it you get um
13:47 - but we tried to
13:48 - tell them like don't spend more than
13:50 - this like try we like instead of
13:51 - spending an hour interviewing we can
13:53 - learn more if you do one hour of the
13:54 - just build a page and run this little
13:56 - test and then the people that built the
13:58 - best page
13:59 - uh we interviewed and then uh from there
14:01 - we voted and then we hired
14:02 - so when you when you say build a page
14:04 - you mean like build an actual website
14:06 - that
14:06 - hack a new website no we just the story
14:09 - page so if you look at like a headline
14:11 - is a story page is the most popular page
14:13 - on our site so that's the frame the the
14:15 - formatting it's like you know headline
14:17 - author feature image
14:18 - right social shares emoji reactions
14:21 - uh tags recommended content footer so
14:24 - it's just
14:24 - and then people would it was cool in the
14:26 - explanation they're like hey yeah if i
14:27 - would keep going i would do this next i
14:29 - got to hear i took a shortcut there
14:31 - and then you get to talk to him about
14:32 - like how did you build this thing and i
14:33 - thought about this page a lot
14:35 - so like whenever we have that discussion
14:37 - it's a page i've thought a lot about and
14:39 - they just spent two hours thinking about
14:40 - how to make a page like that
14:42 - so it's um that's kind of the test that
14:44 - we run and i mean my goal is to
14:46 - for them to spend less time but also to
14:49 - us to learn enough to make a good
14:50 - decision that we're pretty aligned
14:52 - um that's that's the test we ran last
14:54 - time we'll probably run it again
14:55 - that's really cool that's really cool
14:57 - and so okay you guys go ahead you go
14:59 - through this process
15:00 - of having them submit a page which means
15:02 - really interesting you know because
15:03 - a lot of us for example here at kappa we
15:05 - focus on clones like building like
15:07 - you know website clouds right so like
15:09 - yes there's the proof right there that
15:11 - people
15:12 - like website clones you know basically
15:15 - you're cloning your website that's
15:16 - already there right
15:17 - what's up developer companies the amount
15:19 - of times people have told us how to
15:20 - build the uber clone
15:21 - they just the story submissions just
15:24 - keeps going from all these app
15:25 - development companies
15:28 - that's awesome so okay so once you went
15:30 - ahead and you
15:31 - have them let's just say this okay
15:34 - okay a lot of these people they build
15:36 - all these hacker new you know uh
15:38 - the website right not not the landing
15:40 - page but of course but that the article
15:42 - page okay
15:43 - um of course there's still a ton of
15:45 - people who are doing that
15:48 - what do you look for what do you pick
15:50 - from like right
15:51 - there's a hundred people and you only
15:52 - have one spot
15:55 - um in that moment it's like oh i'm
15:58 - looking for details in the page that we
16:00 - chose or how clean their alignment is
16:02 - you're kind of learning
16:03 - where they prioritize back end verse
16:06 - front and even choosing what they say to
16:07 - admit and what i didn't get to
16:09 - like some people just throw out the
16:11 - footer all together some people would
16:12 - put it in a different footer
16:14 - some people would acknowledge they
16:15 - didn't it was interesting to see if they
16:16 - acknowledge what they didn't get to
16:18 - i always appreciate that yeah it's like
16:20 - hey i probably i have the time limit
16:22 - one it proves that you listen to the
16:23 - time limit
16:25 - and communicate better so because do you
16:27 - know if the project keeps going
16:29 - you know you could do it better you know
16:31 - you spend three hours on it and send me
16:32 - something more beautiful and say i'm so
16:34 - great and i did it in 90
16:36 - minutes and i'm like you know that's not
16:38 - as good
16:39 - really people to actually talk about
16:40 - where they were they cut short because
16:42 - the time limit forces that you can't do
16:44 - it perfectly
16:45 - in the time limit but you can come close
16:47 - you can get a good 80
16:48 - thing out i think that's it that we give
16:52 - you
16:52 - wow so you're saying that even for
16:54 - example if i went ahead
16:56 - and i um interviewed for hacker noon
16:59 - as a developer and you guys gave me this
17:02 - what you would do this before the
17:04 - interview before before they ended
17:06 - right yeah and i would say the second
17:08 - after the coding test
17:10 - and then their personal website and is
17:12 - probably second for me
17:13 - so the personal website i think so one
17:16 - we're in publishing and i believe every
17:18 - technologist should tell their story
17:20 - around the internet and that's part of
17:21 - the value we have of bringing traffic
17:23 - back to your corner of the internet
17:24 - so if you don't already have put in the
17:26 - time to build your corner of the
17:28 - internet
17:28 - i don't think you're probably not a good
17:30 - fit here so if you don't
17:32 - have a personal site for a business like
17:34 - mine i want my software developers all
17:36 - to have a personal site already
17:37 - and they value and they understand the
17:39 - value prop that we have with our
17:41 - contributors that they want to drive
17:42 - traffic to something
17:43 - and they want to talk about the projects
17:45 - they're building so
17:47 - other than the test i would say number
17:48 - two is the personal site
17:50 - um and some people it also can be a
17:52 - build up you know
17:53 - linkedin profile it could be your built
17:55 - your github profile that you look at
17:57 - your corners the internet
17:58 - so it doesn't need to be a personal site
18:00 - but like a portfolio confirms that you
18:02 - do care about your corner of the
18:04 - internet and that
18:04 - that means we're already going to be a
18:06 - little more aligned i mean the last one
18:08 - at last engineer we hired marcos
18:10 - his personal site was so funny it was a
18:12 - picture of his actual office and then he
18:14 - did this 3d thing where you look around
18:16 - on the way for the menu yeah i'll all
18:19 - the
18:19 - i'll drop the link after this but it was
18:21 - like it was just unique and it was cool
18:23 - it made him stand out and you know and
18:25 - another one jefferson who he just hired
18:27 - he had a really
18:28 - cool like pixelated 8-bit site where he
18:30 - built it and we do a lot of pixelated
18:32 - stuff in our design
18:33 - so right away when i visit the site you
18:35 - know you kind of feel this alignment of
18:37 - like
18:37 - this respect for that retro old video
18:40 - game and like those first times you
18:41 - found
18:42 - the internet that's so cool wow
18:45 - those are the things we value i love
18:46 - that i love that you know and every
18:48 - company of course is different right in
18:49 - terms of what they value
18:51 - and what they want their you know they
18:52 - see engineers in
18:54 - in engineers right but what do you think
18:56 - is the number one
18:57 - thing that is the one is the most
18:59 - important thing do you guys look for
19:01 - in a developer may that be when they're
19:04 - you know
19:04 - coding it up or may that be when they
19:07 - are go to the interview what is the
19:08 - number one thing you guys look for
19:11 - um since for me since i'm more on the
19:14 - product management side and the writing
19:16 - side you know i'm really looking for
19:17 - empathy and communication
19:18 - so there's obviously the hard skills
19:20 - part of it and i trust our test and if
19:22 - we tweak our tests for a different role
19:24 - i think about it and i talk to people
19:26 - and i trust it
19:27 - but whenever i'm in the stage you know
19:29 - as the ceo hiring this small team of
19:31 - software developers
19:32 - you know i'm really looking for empathy
19:34 - communication and people
19:36 - people that choose to do it themselves
19:38 - first at this stage when we're only 11
19:40 - full-time people
19:41 - it's like everyone needs to be a top
19:43 - individual contributor including myself
19:45 - no one can be just a manager or no one
19:48 - can be
19:48 - hey i need a designer and a back-end
19:51 - developer in order to ship this feature
19:53 - it's like no you're a full stack
19:54 - developer you know like you don't need
19:56 - both sides support no matter what
19:58 - if one side isn't there you can kind of
20:00 - you know work around it plug in
20:02 - and get it out you have to revisit and
20:04 - clean it up
20:05 - and reconnect it later but like you're
20:07 - full stack enough that you got to the
20:09 - stage where you ship the feature and
20:11 - people start using it and you can learn
20:12 - to iterate
20:13 - so that's more of like you know the
20:15 - easiest way to show that is by having
20:17 - your own product out there somewhere
20:18 - right and
20:19 - having that thing functioning say hey i
20:20 - worked on this project with these two
20:22 - people
20:23 - and you can play with it and you can
20:24 - play with and that comes back to the
20:26 - personal site like how you're collecting
20:27 - your information
20:28 - how you're collecting your work um yeah
20:31 - so that's what we look for
20:32 - that's really cool and what i really
20:34 - love about this is you know the fact
20:36 - that you did say communication
20:38 - and you know even those soft skills it's
20:39 - something because it's something i very
20:41 - much talk about
20:42 - right so i for example i've had the
20:44 - pleasure of working i mean sometimes
20:46 - splatter stuff there's not so much
20:47 - pleasure
20:48 - like working with a lot of developers
20:49 - right work with you know startup
20:50 - companies
20:51 - i'm personally i'd love startup
20:53 - companies so i work as a lot of startup
20:55 - companies
20:55 - um and then we're also working corporate
20:58 - companies
20:59 - and for a big portion you know what i've
21:02 - realized is that
21:03 - it's honestly not just the biggest thing
21:05 - not the biggest thing is not just about
21:07 - your skills around technical
21:11 - but it's also your soft skills how good
21:13 - of a human being
21:14 - are you because what in the smaller the
21:17 - company the more the individual
21:18 - contributor decides what they do
21:20 - and what they work on and so really
21:22 - judging do you are you able to level
21:24 - measure impact are able to say how does
21:26 - this impact readers writers sponsors
21:28 - editors admins and think
21:30 - what what will happen how do i measure
21:32 - this impact and you're choosing what you
21:33 - prioritize and what you work on
21:35 - it's like i yeah i want a brain that i
21:37 - believe in i want a brain that cares
21:39 - about those users and cares and
21:40 - understands
21:41 - hey when i do this it's going to piss
21:42 - off ten thousand people by putting up
21:44 - this pop-up
21:45 - maybe i should pick up the pop-up
21:47 - instead and what happens is people these
21:49 - big tech companies they put up the
21:50 - pop-up
21:51 - and then they say look our subscription
21:53 - numbers went up by this much
21:55 - don't talk about the pop-up don't talk
21:56 - about how he did it
21:58 - character comes in and you choose the
22:00 - software development choices and
22:02 - it sucks you know sometimes you have to
22:03 - take on the weight of pissing off a lot
22:05 - of users when a thing breaks
22:07 - and these readers yeah there's a guilt
22:10 - that you have to be able to carry and
22:11 - you have to trust that you could like
22:13 - you know hey all right i know i messed
22:14 - up today i'm going to help these people
22:16 - tomorrow here's how i'm going to do it
22:17 - you know that stuff is um that that
22:20 - takes some weight and if you have a
22:21 - sociopath
22:22 - that's saying they don't care about what
22:24 - happens to those things
22:26 - it's like the business who knows
22:29 - it's actually really interesting enough
22:30 - i i worked this company once i'm not
22:32 - going to say well company but
22:34 - um i worked with this company where they
22:36 - brought in this lead developer
22:37 - right the elite developer is a great you
22:39 - know great person very technical
22:41 - uh basically was about to come in and
22:43 - fully redo the whole system
22:45 - okay and that was the goal is to make it
22:47 - a lot more secure a lot more
22:49 - scalable as a developer came in
22:53 - um really quickly the desire started to
22:56 - change a lot of different things
22:58 - really started to change all these
22:59 - different backing systems actually you
23:01 - know within two weeks the back-end
23:02 - system has changed
23:03 - uh the front-end did not know about any
23:05 - of the back-end system changes
23:07 - uh that thing was pushed live next to
23:09 - you know everything is broken and then
23:11 - next thing you know 95 percent of the
23:12 - people were fired
23:14 - so it's it's yeah yeah
23:17 - huh no i was not fired no i was not
23:20 - fired i was a full star developer
23:23 - i was the five percent that stayed on
23:27 - there were only it's actually me and one
23:29 - of my friends uh one of my friends he
23:31 - we're both foster developers and so we
23:32 - stayed on
23:33 - and we helped the guy out pretty much to
23:36 - kind of bring him up you know uh from
23:38 - what was going on with the whole
23:39 - basically his system just going down
23:41 - fully
23:42 - um but i think it's just really
23:43 - interesting right it's just like the
23:44 - importance of one
23:46 - how one person can really can really
23:48 - change so much in the company especially
23:50 - when you're so small and two the
23:52 - importance of that communication that
23:53 - you're talking about
23:55 - right so when you say communication how
23:57 - do you test it how do you see that in a
23:59 - person
24:01 - um mostly text i mean so i'm going back
24:04 - i'm reading what they say they would do
24:05 - and what they did
24:06 - so there's that element of communication
24:08 - of like accountability
24:09 - that you just want to look back and see
24:11 - what people prioritize and commit to
24:14 - um because i i mean i can't understate
24:17 - how valuable it is to be a good writer
24:18 - right now
24:19 - the developers that i work well with are
24:21 - willing to write and they take the time
24:22 - to write and
24:23 - some of them are verbose and some of
24:25 - them are very witty and sharp
24:27 - but clearly if you would read them and
24:29 - they're a developer or not you'd say
24:31 - that person knows how to write
24:32 - so that the written word for me becomes
24:34 - really important for communication with
24:36 - software development
24:38 - you know so that's um that's something i
24:40 - just value a lot and
24:41 - the precision of your language and what
24:42 - you look at and how even the tone
24:44 - like i'll have pet peeves i'll see red
24:46 - flags of you uh for example
24:48 - if you write something out and it's a
24:50 - question but you put a period
24:52 - that's subconscious stuff i look for
24:53 - those little subconscious things
24:55 - sometimes because it's like
24:56 - okay i get where you're coming from you
24:58 - think you can command people you see
25:00 - okay maybe it's a typo then you see it
25:01 - three five times and you see it happen
25:03 - when things escalate
25:04 - and you're like okay i get it that's
25:06 - that's what's going on there so there's
25:08 - um
25:08 - the precision in the written word and
25:10 - then going back you know looking at old
25:12 - typos is kind of funny and stuff like
25:13 - that but
25:14 - when i say communication i i mean it
25:16 - definitely matters that we can meet and
25:17 - talk out our options and say
25:19 - here's how we're going to d scope here's
25:21 - what we're going to prioritize if we do
25:22 - scope that can we get to here
25:24 - right so the discussions are very useful
25:26 - to have in you know the in-person
25:28 - meeting i mean actually i'm now at the
25:30 - point in the company where
25:32 - ling my wife is the only person i've uh
25:35 - the only one i've met in person wait
25:37 - what
25:40 - your wife is everybody else's remote
25:43 - right as we were expanding and so like
25:47 - wow and so what what countries like
25:49 - where where is everybody at
25:52 - um michigan florida
25:55 - um ukraine india ukraine
25:59 - yeah i'm from ukraine and i was oh and
26:02 - also i've been living michigan for the
26:03 - past
26:04 - seven years
26:05 - [Laughter]
26:07 - yeah yeah we got south africa uh
26:10 - amsterdam
26:11 - um yeah all over pretty much every time
26:14 - zone japan
26:15 - australia that's a tough time zone for
26:17 - meetings okay okay
26:19 - i have i have a question about it online
26:23 - i bet it's not that easy to get
26:25 - everybody on board in a team meeting no
26:26 - like
26:27 - like when everybody's telling me so many
26:28 - different time zones uh yeah we only
26:30 - have one all hands
26:31 - meeting a month so there's only one
26:33 - meeting that everyone uh is like
26:35 - mostly required you know obviously if
26:36 - you have something important
26:38 - or deadline or something or personal you
26:41 - know you can't make it but yeah
26:42 - it is tougher i mean you definitely want
26:44 - to do less meetings um
26:46 - less meetings are good i usually do two
26:48 - to three a day i try to keep it to two
26:50 - max so i can get six hours of focused
26:52 - work
26:53 - um on the keyboard uh but
26:56 - yeah it's it is a it is a little
26:58 - challenging for sure and i appreciate
27:00 - like the sacrifices that people
27:01 - make with late meetings and early
27:03 - meetings i don't want to like abuse it
27:05 - you know so i want to schedule like
27:07 - selectively but like also
27:09 - you know it is good that the teammates
27:11 - are willing to do that for each other
27:12 - that's true that is true that is true so
27:14 - i want to stay in the topic of a little
27:16 - bit of
27:16 - um of the interview side of a portion
27:19 - and kind of what you guys are looking
27:20 - for okay
27:21 - what you guys look for in general so
27:24 - soft skills communication skills okay
27:26 - are there any other soft skills besides
27:28 - communication that you guys think are
27:29 - really important
27:30 - and someone who's trying to go ahead
27:33 - humility
27:34 - is the most yeah it's it's just very
27:37 - hard to work with people who really
27:39 - believe
27:39 - their farts smell great it's it's
27:41 - difficult you know and you look
27:43 - across like when people get really smart
27:45 - it's easy to get really arrogant
27:47 - and so that's something where it's like
27:49 - looking for that humility and like
27:51 - being able to you know confidently talk
27:53 - about your work but not
27:54 - being able to just put yourself as this
27:57 - hero and ignore your faults
27:58 - and prop yourselves up in your stories
28:00 - so that's that's where it just gets hard
28:02 - you know we've learned like
28:03 - the more humble somebody is the more
28:05 - they can actually do a lot of times
28:07 - yeah whenever engaging like where is
28:09 - this interview from reality
28:11 - to what output i will get if you start
28:13 - to sense that they lack humility
28:15 - you're going to sense that okay at
28:16 - whatever i pay them they're going to
28:18 - expect
28:19 - that what they deliver is a lower amount
28:20 - then the humility person is going to say
28:22 - hey
28:23 - like i you know i'm going to come in and
28:25 - i'm going to bring more than i promised
28:26 - and i would you know more than i more
28:28 - than i implied i'm able to do i actually
28:30 - can do other things that i didn't even
28:31 - talk about
28:32 - you know because i'm humble i talk so
28:34 - that's where like
28:35 - um if you can if you can identify
28:38 - humility well
28:38 - you can usually build a team of really
28:41 - top contributors that like help each
28:43 - other out
28:44 - because the more arrogance seeks in
28:46 - seeps into the company
28:47 - the more your team will be disjointed
28:49 - and it will be frankensteiny and it will
28:52 - break yeah i agree with that i get 100
28:55 - how do you hope in your situation how do
28:57 - you test humility or how do you test
28:59 - arrogance
29:02 - i guess i feel like it's really hard to
29:03 - test you know unless you actually work
29:05 - with that person
29:06 - i mean you can just talk how i would
29:09 - whenever they tell their stories of
29:10 - their past work really look for how they
29:12 - relate to themselves in the team
29:14 - and how much they how they use i you
29:16 - know how they
29:17 - whenever you ask them like who helped do
29:18 - what and just um
29:20 - i don't know it can also just be in
29:22 - little things of talking about
29:25 - other stuff and really you don't learn
29:26 - it until that first project and that's
29:28 - why we try and get them through the
29:29 - first project as quickly as possible our
29:31 - hiring process is one
29:32 - one to two interviews never three like
29:35 - we're not even going that far
29:37 - on the you know these uh software
29:38 - development roles because
29:40 - we want to you want to make sure the
29:42 - test is good and value your time for the
29:43 - test
29:44 - have the interview and then get in for a
29:46 - quick part part-time project where we
29:48 - pick something and build it together um
29:51 - i like that i like that
29:52 - so base of some from the community
29:55 - humility portion okay
29:57 - how i'm very curious you know i know you
30:00 - said that
30:00 - you see that the humility portion also
30:03 - from the project that they do you know
30:04 - whenever they somebody states the truth
30:06 - around hey you know i just couldn't
30:08 - finish that in that one hour
30:09 - you see that as actually as a positive
30:11 - thing not a negative thing
30:13 - yes absolutely i find that very
30:15 - interesting because you know a lot of
30:16 - people
30:17 - i've heard so of course i've heard i've
30:18 - heard some people hey you know just lie
30:20 - the interview and then
30:21 - i and then you will you'll somehow get
30:23 - into it you know from your perspective
30:24 - it's a very different
30:26 - it's you know just be as truthful as
30:27 - possible about who you are
30:30 - and you know if they like your truth and
30:33 - who you are then
30:34 - you know you're a much better fit for
30:35 - the company yep
30:37 - gotcha so now at that point how have you
30:41 - seen humility affect your so for example
30:42 - if there was a person maybe
30:44 - who wasn't so humble how do you see that
30:46 - affecting your company
30:48 - um i think it's because our core metrics
30:50 - are words published time reading and
30:53 - revenue
30:53 - so i think you can kind of see it
30:55 - sometimes where people will put their
30:57 - projects
30:58 - push their projects further or me imply
31:00 - their project is more important
31:02 - whenever it's like hey we're all trying
31:03 - to get to these three goals
31:05 - you know and the thing you're doing it
31:07 - does tan generally relate
31:08 - but it's like you're trying to push it
31:10 - forward because it's like the thing you
31:12 - love
31:12 - it's your baby and it's your thing you
31:14 - want to do and instead of helping others
31:16 - a little more of moving towards those
31:18 - goals
31:18 - you just kind of push your thing more so
31:20 - i think there's something where
31:22 - why we pick projects can start to become
31:24 - very selfish and you want to align the
31:26 - selfishness with the company goals
31:28 - and so whenever it becomes when those
31:30 - alignments come off and it's like
31:32 - i want to do this because i'm interested
31:34 - in it and it's not really going to
31:36 - impact those metrics too much sometimes
31:37 - you get down this rabbit hole of
31:39 - your interest is more important than the
31:41 - company's goals and moving those
31:42 - forwards so
31:43 - that's where you kind of see it like but
31:45 - it's head um
31:48 - but it's uh yeah i don't know that's
31:51 - cool no
31:51 - no i mean i think it's this is a great
31:54 - answer for a lot of people who are
31:55 - watching because of course right
31:57 - our audience is very much you know some
31:59 - of them are focused
32:00 - you know maybe they're more
32:01 - entrepreneurship a lot of them are
32:03 - focused on
32:04 - getting ready you know maybe for a job
32:05 - they want to become developers
32:07 - and so this gives them a lot of answer
32:08 - insight about you know who
32:10 - they need to be um and so software
32:13 - developers that can understand what are
32:15 - the goals of the company and be able to
32:17 - answer that
32:17 - smoothly you know that's where you can
32:20 - kind of have the one sentence mission
32:21 - and then you can kind of have the core
32:23 - metrics but it teaches you when you want
32:24 - to advocate for a feature for example
32:26 - you know someone if a developer is
32:28 - saying hey we need to invest in this big
32:29 - time
32:30 - i need to focus on this over that and
32:32 - it's because i think it's going to get
32:33 - us 10 000 new writers
32:35 - i think it's going to open up this
32:36 - distribution channel to 10 million new
32:38 - readers
32:39 - and you kind of look around and you
32:40 - start to think okay it's moving our
32:42 - numbers in
32:43 - and it does make sense to build that
32:44 - instead of this so it's that overlap of
32:46 - like
32:47 - when software developers see how their
32:50 - work
32:50 - impacts the core metrics of the company
32:52 - then they can make better choices and i
32:54 - always appreciate when
32:55 - i get convinced to do something else
32:57 - because
32:59 - that's interesting but you now have made
33:00 - a good case that that's a more valuable
33:02 - use of your time
33:03 - great you know and you understood the
33:05 - questions i would ask about how it would
33:07 - impact those numbers
33:08 - so that's it's a good moment and i
33:09 - always appreciate it when it happens
33:11 - i love that i love that because this is
33:14 - what i love to do
33:15 - as i love to challenge those those type
33:17 - of things okay so
33:19 - and this is what i what i actually teach
33:20 - to my students a lot of times in the
33:21 - booth camps and the courses
33:23 - you know i always say that no company
33:26 - really likes
33:26 - a yes person like word so always yes yes
33:30 - yes yes yes yes yes
33:31 - right i always say that um this is just
33:34 - my
33:34 - my thinking and you can tell me what you
33:36 - think about this okay
33:38 - it's just how you said that hey you know
33:40 - what if somebody can tell you or
33:42 - or maybe propose a different idea that
33:44 - they might think a bit better
33:45 - that says a lot more than if jesus just
33:48 - and then if they were to just go ahead
33:49 - you know what okay yeah i'll do it you
33:52 - know from my perspective
33:53 - you know when managers for example
33:54 - managers or somebody who comes with a
33:56 - feature they're like hey nas you know we
33:57 - gotta
33:58 - build this feature and so forth my first
34:01 - question is usually
34:02 - what is the goal with that feature
34:07 - why are we trying to build this and once
34:09 - once
34:10 - i understand that goal then then usually
34:12 - what usually happens is
34:13 - hey let's actually think about the will
34:16 - this future actually get us to that goal
34:20 - sometimes as you start breaking things
34:21 - down you realize that it actually might
34:23 - not
34:26 - have you found that in your position
34:28 - yeah
34:29 - absolutely a lot of times as a good
34:30 - product manager i'm basically a sounding
34:32 - board
34:33 - and i'm listening to okay where was the
34:35 - block okay where was the block
34:37 - and then it's like okay let's also just
34:39 - weigh these two things let's talk out
34:41 - two ways to get to the same goal that
34:42 - are completely different
34:43 - let's just talk out each option should
34:45 - we consider what why is this one good
34:47 - why is this one bad why is this one good
34:48 - why is that one bad
34:49 - so just that like little bit of back and
34:51 - forth is really um
34:52 - fun um i i will say that the people that
34:56 - say they're looking for yes people where
34:57 - that's coming from is they're looking
34:59 - for reliability
35:00 - because you do want reliable people you
35:02 - do want to trust when it's their shift
35:04 - for tech tech support
35:05 - you know they'll do it you know you want
35:07 - to trust that hey
35:09 - if the urgent bug happens they can drop
35:11 - everything if a minor bug happens and
35:12 - it's in the say it needs to be fixed in
35:14 - 10 days
35:15 - you just trust that you put it in the
35:16 - queue and a solution will be reached so
35:18 - there is
35:19 - a reliability whenever people say that
35:21 - yes people thing
35:22 - it's they there is a reliability that if
35:24 - you can trust the person to show up and
35:26 - do the job
35:27 - everything will go better and building
35:28 - trust is really important to making more
35:30 - money
35:31 - and building up your relationships and
35:33 - proving that you're worth more money so
35:35 - i don't want to like dismiss that but
35:36 - definitely the yes man stuff is bad
35:38 - and like if you don't trust if you can't
35:40 - tell yourself why you're building this
35:42 - thing
35:42 - the answer is because someone described
35:44 - how to build it there and told me to
35:46 - build it
35:46 - you should probably look for another job
35:51 - you may not today but you probably will
35:52 - soon because it's just too it's too
35:54 - brainless
35:55 - it's it's uh it lacks the purpose and
35:57 - the reason
35:58 - that's the purpose you know of just
35:59 - coding in general right
36:01 - the the whole
36:04 - what i love about just coding is the
36:06 - fact that it's such a creative aspect
36:08 - whatever you can put out can either make
36:10 - it or break it
36:12 - it can really help out a company very
36:13 - much or it can actually
36:15 - you know not help out and actually make
36:17 - it do it worse
36:18 - right but with just a line of code
36:22 - you can create something that a lot of
36:23 - people can use
36:25 - so i would argue this is old though
36:27 - because like writing has been like this
36:28 - for a while
36:29 - okay so you read something to start your
36:31 - day it's going to change your whole
36:32 - outlook
36:33 - your whole outlook whatever you read in
36:35 - the morning paper is going to change the
36:36 - way you see the world that day whatever
36:38 - app you open on your phone whatever
36:40 - headlines whatever social updates you
36:42 - dig into that stuff is all like
36:44 - framing how you see the world and so i
36:46 - mean the written word like
36:47 - code is kind of like this evolution of
36:50 - the written word or like
36:51 - maybe it's a branch off or like a
36:54 - metaverse
36:54 - universe of the written word i'm like
36:57 - speaking to computers is now its own
36:59 - language but to me i still group the
37:01 - bigger thing is together under the
37:02 - written word
37:03 - i love that the biggest technology and
37:05 - the most powerful thing i love that i
37:06 - love that
37:07 - so now tell me this okay okay when you
37:10 - guys interview i know you you had the
37:12 - project and so forth
37:13 - in terms of the actual coding aspect
37:15 - when you guys talk to a person
37:18 - what are the coding course i'm not
37:20 - saying what quality questions you ask
37:21 - but what you
37:22 - focus on when you do get to talk to them
37:24 - in person
37:25 - you know through skype or through an
37:26 - interview and so forth so usually
37:28 - another engineer will do that part so
37:30 - they can get more technical
37:32 - and they're really breaking down what
37:33 - portions of the tech stack do they know
37:35 - that we already have
37:36 - uh talking about the bigger problems and
37:39 - solutions we're working on to figure out
37:41 - what excites them
37:42 - because it's also a matter or we're
37:43 - broad enough that when you come in we
37:45 - don't exactly know what you're going to
37:47 - work on
37:47 - you know it's the conversation of where
37:49 - interest and experience overlaps with
37:51 - possible projects we've detailed or
37:53 - possible projects we come up with
37:55 - together
37:55 - so that that part um and really yeah how
37:58 - they work with people before and i mean
37:59 - i really the
38:00 - key questions i ask engineers is would
38:02 - you enjoy working with this person
38:04 - that's and if they i can you know how
38:06 - they hesitate
38:07 - like the engineer that interviews the
38:09 - candidate that's the first question i
38:10 - want to ask them
38:11 - um because if once if they trust that
38:13 - they're going to enjoy working with them
38:15 - that's a
38:16 - that's a sign that they're endorsing
38:17 - their talents they're endorsing the mess
38:19 - they
38:19 - they would have to be the more the team
38:21 - is excited to receive messages from each
38:23 - other
38:23 - the more everything like starts to go
38:26 - well
38:27 - like if they're not excited to receive
38:28 - messages from the teammate
38:30 - it's like that's the moment where it's
38:31 - like that's bad that that's that can
38:33 - create
38:33 - you know people spending energy on like
38:37 - needless anger or like just things that
38:39 - don't help the work itself and you're
38:41 - spending energy on it doesn't help the
38:42 - work so
38:43 - that's the first one i asked them and um
38:46 - yeah and
38:46 - we'll see a lot of the interview notes
38:48 - we'll have you'll see like hey there's
38:50 - gaps here in their knowledge they seem
38:51 - to be really experienced there
38:53 - and then we're also trying to gauge how
38:55 - quickly they learn so the ability to
38:57 - learn
38:57 - quickly is can't be under can't be
39:00 - overstated and how valuable it is
39:02 - like it doesn't if you don't know
39:03 - firebase it doesn't mean you can't learn
39:05 - the database like yeah
39:07 - databases it's like so you're also kind
39:09 - of judging like hey what's something you
39:11 - got excited about and learned really
39:12 - fast like where
39:13 - where's the project where you came into
39:15 - that project and you didn't have any
39:16 - experience with that type of code or
39:18 - typescript or whatever it is
39:20 - but you were able to learn it quickly
39:22 - and you know become the project leader
39:23 - and then ship the thing and like
39:25 - when did you choose a technology and why
39:28 - asking people why they chose the
39:29 - technologies they chose is also
39:30 - interesting because a lot of times it'll
39:32 - be like
39:32 - that's what the legacy was but yeah like
39:35 - hey i
39:35 - found it and i have been waiting for the
39:37 - use case i always love when people get
39:39 - to that like i was really excited about
39:40 - it and i played with it and i was just
39:42 - looking for where i could put it
39:44 - that's um it's like one of the things we
39:47 - look for
39:47 - it's like the center of like oh there's
39:48 - a there's a new framework let's use it
39:50 - i'm just i'm so excited to use that new
39:52 - framework there's like a new friend that
39:53 - comes out every single
39:55 - month or so which is not just so hard to
39:58 - keep up with but it's also really fun
39:59 - like i just recently recently realized
40:01 - uh
40:02 - tail and css uh i haven't gotten the
40:04 - chance but i'm like
40:05 - holy [ __ ] it's so cool you know
40:09 - yeah i think that's come up like three
40:11 - times in our slack of people like
40:13 - finding it the same way of like wanting
40:14 - to use it and not like having the
40:16 - finding wanting to use it before they
40:18 - have a use case of just whenever they
40:20 - stumble on it
40:21 - so so let me say this okay when you guys
40:24 - look for engineers okay
40:26 - is it you know are the people who
40:28 - already have experience out of
40:29 - experience or
40:30 - do you guys and take on any students who
40:32 - not students are people who maybe
40:34 - haven't had experience and
40:35 - what do you look for if somebody hasn't
40:37 - had too much experience in terms of
40:39 - you know working at companies but maybe
40:40 - they built projects and maybe they're
40:42 - coming from
40:43 - maybe their self-learner what do you
40:44 - look for in that and that
40:46 - i mean i love self-learners i mean our
40:48 - first three engineers i think didn't go
40:50 - to college
40:51 - and they had more work experience in the
40:53 - beginning and then we've had
40:54 - younger engineers that we hired that
40:56 - just finished boot camp and had like one
40:58 - or two jobs or
41:00 - finished boot camp had a couple clients
41:02 - and was basically building stuff for
41:03 - other people and had kind of their own
41:05 - projects on the side
41:06 - um oh full i call him full stack intern
41:10 - but we hired an 18 year old software
41:11 - developer and we just hired him to throw
41:13 - it on hacker noon
41:14 - he wrote on hacker noon about how to
41:15 - improve our page performance
41:17 - speed uh so we hired him to work with us
41:21 - no way so
41:24 - how did you guys notice him does he just
41:25 - notice him because he wrote an article
41:27 - did you just notice him because he
41:28 - actually applied
41:29 - so he wrote a story about uh google
41:31 - lighthouse speed and i was
41:32 - at the time digging into our google
41:34 - lighthouse speed i was like
41:36 - great i'm just gonna meet with him and
41:37 - uh see if he's not crazy and if he's not
41:39 - crazy i'll hire him
41:42 - you guys heard it here first if you're
41:44 - not if you're not crazy they'll just
41:45 - hire you
41:48 - he built the free internet plug-in so if
41:49 - you if you google free internet plug-in
41:51 - we build a google search plug-in and
41:53 - what it does is it removes
41:55 - uh paywall results from the google
41:57 - search results and then you can
41:58 - customize it to add other
42:00 - sites or not that you don't want to
42:01 - appear so instead of seeing the paywall
42:03 - site and clicking through and getting to
42:05 - the paywall we just take out those
42:06 - results and like
42:08 - penalize the companies that use paywall
42:10 - and make google search
42:12 - actually free closer to free that's
42:14 - awesome that's great that's great
42:16 - so now okay you guys go through this
42:18 - whole process
42:19 - at any point i know you guys give them a
42:21 - coding question on any points you guys
42:23 - test them on
42:24 - besides the project on things like you
42:26 - know algorithms and data structures or
42:28 - do you guys not focus very much on that
42:30 - on those
42:30 - you know those typical coding interview
42:32 - questions they usually get like
42:33 - google which is like you know can you
42:35 - create a recursive function you know or
42:36 - can you create a link tree
42:38 - is there any focus on that um not for
42:41 - like the general entry-level software
42:42 - development role for us
42:44 - but for you know we are doing some stuff
42:46 - with recommended stories that would get
42:48 - to that level of complexity but the
42:50 - people working on it are already
42:52 - on the team so we're not like we're not
42:54 - like pushing for a really machine
42:55 - learning heavy
42:56 - people right now we're more in the stage
42:58 - where we like full stack developers that
43:00 - have expertise
43:01 - so you're more full stack and you're
43:03 - better at something specific
43:04 - um is kind of like more of what we look
43:07 - for
43:08 - um but i i i think uh
43:11 - to me it's just as long as the companies
43:13 - keep the interview question
43:14 - coding tests very short and not do too
43:17 - much stuff on the upfront
43:19 - um it's a good sign i just think a lot
43:21 - of time gets wasted on the
43:22 - long interview quite long challenges or
43:26 - that like it's just it doesn't respect
43:28 - people's time enough
43:29 - um to me if you're a company if i can if
43:32 - i can't learn enough in three hours with
43:34 - you like i haven't designed my process
43:35 - well enough like an hour and a half test
43:37 - or two hour test and one hour interview
43:39 - or however that splits up
43:41 - that's like a more reasonable thing of
43:42 - like you want to hire this person or not
43:44 - yeah yeah yeah and i love the fact i
43:46 - love what you talked about
43:48 - previously which is you just ask the
43:51 - person if they're
43:52 - great to work with like would you want
43:53 - to work with that person right
43:55 - i think that says a lot because like it
43:57 - or not i think in environment something
43:59 - is the one the most important things
44:00 - besides any even any any technical
44:03 - knowledge yes technology is important
44:04 - but if the environment is just not right
44:06 - that ruins the whole thing pretty much
44:08 - yeah
44:09 - people that pick other people up are
44:11 - really really valuable
44:12 - and um it's hard to see until they get
44:14 - in the room but
44:15 - it's uh it's worth its weight in gold um
44:18 - it just makes
44:19 - logging in so much more fun um and it's
44:23 - like
44:23 - you the thing is you're going if you're
44:25 - working hard you're spending a lot of
44:27 - your waking time with these people
44:29 - and if you don't like them your day your
44:31 - not your mental health is not going to
44:33 - be good
44:33 - you're going to lash out in other ways
44:36 - and it's just uh
44:37 - you want to enjoy the people even though
44:40 - they're on the screen
44:40 - you know they're not the same as you
44:42 - know going in the office in person
44:43 - if you don't enjoy when their thumbnail
44:45 - comes up and you don't enjoy reading
44:46 - their text
44:47 - you're not going to enjoy your day
44:50 - you heard it here first be presentable
44:53 - on text and be presentable on
44:54 - zoom
44:58 - so that's really interesting you know um
45:01 - talking about how to get a job at some
45:03 - something like a
45:04 - an amazing place like hacker new and i
45:06 - think it gives them a lot of insight
45:07 - around what they can focus on and the
45:09 - one thing
45:10 - the first thing we talked about which is
45:11 - hey you know go into portfolio make sure
45:13 - you have a good
45:14 - portfolio some kind of a website that
45:15 - really presents yourself right
45:17 - put yourself out there i talk a lot
45:19 - about this to
45:20 - you know my students and you know i
45:23 - personally love that like you know if
45:24 - you share just what you know
45:26 - people will just get to know you a lot
45:27 - better and plus you make a lot more
45:29 - connections
45:30 - right even for example on hackernoon are
45:32 - they able to themselves just go there
45:34 - i'll go on there and they'll simply post
45:36 - topics and make it make articles on
45:38 - there so anyone can uh sign up and write
45:41 - a story and then it submits to an editor
45:43 - and we accept about half the stories um
45:47 - for quality control so that's you know
45:50 - some of the stuff's not good enough and
45:51 - if the editor can get it to
45:54 - our level within 30 minutes they'll help
45:57 - you and do it if not they'll reject it
45:58 - and they'll tell you a reason
46:00 - for why and saying hey you improve that
46:02 - you know it can come back
46:04 - so yeah that's i mean a lot of people in
46:06 - coding schools are writing on the
46:08 - platform a lot of early software
46:09 - developers a lot of hungry people that
46:11 - are saying hey i want to prove that i
46:12 - know this
46:13 - and i put it out there and it's on
46:15 - hacker noon and hackernoon verified it
46:17 - and fact checked it
46:19 - you know the third party saying i know
46:21 - how to do this you have a
46:22 - on your resume you have a a like this
46:26 - little logo that says fact checked by
46:27 - hackernoon
46:28 - [Laughter]
46:30 - great great so i wanted to talk a little
46:33 - bit about
46:34 - you know the story behind behind how
46:36 - this was created and
46:38 - you know even your back on yourself
46:40 - because i'm very curious about
46:41 - what it takes you know to build some of
46:44 - this i know this doesn't take
46:45 - you know a little effort no does it take
46:47 - one just one person to do this
46:49 - right let's maybe go from the beginning
46:52 - of
46:53 - okay where you were how you got started
46:56 - are you currently in college are you
46:58 - currently university
47:00 - what were you doing at that point before
47:02 - you even got into hackernoon
47:04 - yes i went to university for economics
47:07 - and creative writing
47:08 - so background on you know kind of
47:10 - business in the written word
47:11 - um then i was a newspaper reporter and
47:14 - then i worked for a startup called smart
47:16 - recruiters
47:17 - they uh shout out to them they just
47:18 - raised 110 million oh wow
47:21 - this week uh yeah but when i joined them
47:23 - they it was a five-person team
47:25 - and i left the company when it was about
47:26 - 125 people
47:28 - so i just kind of saw this growth phase
47:30 - of the company and that was like
47:32 - three and a half years of just learning
47:34 - apprenticing from the ceo
47:35 - learning how how to grow an internet
47:37 - company but so
47:38 - i kind of looked at that as like my
47:41 - graduate degree
47:42 - you know if you want to look at it like
47:43 - hey college i went to college for four
47:45 - years then i spent about another four
47:46 - years kind of just learning how to build
47:47 - an internet business
47:49 - that's that was kind of my perspective
47:51 - and why i wanted my own internet
47:53 - business
47:54 - um and then i left that company and i
47:57 - was just trying to work with the best
47:58 - entrepreneurs i knew kind of growing
48:00 - their business and having these
48:01 - different consulting contracts and at
48:02 - the same time
48:04 - i built the first app of this company
48:06 - was actually called map shot
48:09 - map shot pictures on the background of
48:12 - the map
48:13 - this is before apple had that feature
48:15 - google that feature
48:16 - of where the maps pictures were on the
48:18 - map and the idea was to build a social
48:21 - network
48:21 - where the more likes and engagement it
48:24 - got the bigger the pictures got and the
48:25 - more of the map it took up so it just
48:27 - like smashed together a bunch of
48:29 - pictures
48:30 - and it was like a way too much of a
48:32 - graphics challenge to like
48:34 - complete it was just like all these
48:36 - overlapping things and they would get
48:37 - gray
48:38 - so you needed like all these complex
48:39 - rules about like how to pick the line
48:42 - where one image ends and the other ones
48:43 - begins
48:44 - it just ended up where i spent probably
48:48 - uh from the from my own money i spent
48:50 - about 10k
48:51 - just like trying to build this app
48:53 - without software developers
48:55 - yeah and it was like revenue from the
48:57 - marketing business i was like
48:58 - besting my marketing service business
49:00 - into software
49:02 - and so that that ended up uh failing
49:05 - were you were you doing any coding when
49:07 - you were doing that or was it just like
49:09 - you know you were hiring developers
49:10 - separately and you had no idea about
49:12 - coding mainly doing uh wireframing and
49:15 - no i i was i would like try to look
49:17 - review the code and learn from it but
49:19 - like
49:20 - i'm not at that level you know i'm i'm
49:22 - more like
49:23 - visual and i'm like drawing these little
49:25 - pictures making
49:27 - wireframes trying to manage the the
49:29 - feature functions of it and what to cut
49:31 - and what to keep and
49:33 - more like that you're the idea guy
49:34 - you're the steve jobs basically
49:37 - i would not be a steve jobs
49:40 - i'm saying if it was ju i'm saying if it
49:43 - was just the idea persons that i'm
49:44 - saying right because i know steve jobs
49:46 - was not the best person as well just in
49:47 - general
49:48 - you know around some of some of the
49:49 - things i mean i was i was saying hey i'm
49:51 - going to spend half my time working for
49:53 - other people and i'm going to reinvest
49:54 - that revenue into software
49:56 - and i'm going to i'm gonna try that and
49:57 - i'm gonna build more sites and if i
49:59 - don't have the ability to build the
50:00 - thing i want to build i'm gonna take
50:02 - some of the revenue from marketing
50:03 - and put it into here and hire that labor
50:05 - so that was like more of my
50:07 - mindset about how to grow a business
50:08 - like to me a business is about
50:10 - bringing it has to have revenue in and
50:12 - it has to cost more than the the input
50:14 - you spend out
50:16 - otherwise it's not a profitable business
50:19 - yeah
50:20 - that's not the easiest thing to do
50:24 - okay okay so you went ahead and you you
50:26 - were building this application didn't go
50:27 - so well so what happened next
50:29 - well i just kept serving clients and
50:31 - then i was looking for other ways to
50:32 - build sites
50:33 - um so i built a lot of sites with uh
50:35 - medium.com and their software and
50:37 - content management system
50:39 - so that's a number of publications most
50:41 - of which have all died
50:42 - and then there's uh blog licensing apps
50:45 - i tried to build
50:46 - um and so but it got to the point where
50:49 - like hacker noon was by far
50:50 - the best like all the sites put together
50:53 - and all the apps i put together weren't
50:54 - as many readers as hackernoon
50:56 - so this area of like technologists
50:58 - coming to a place and inventing a word
51:01 - you know so the hackernoon wasn't a word
51:03 - it was a domain i bought for 13.
51:05 - what yeah the 13.99 on godaddy
51:10 - well that's probably worth a lot more
51:11 - huh yeah i mean it was a clean
51:13 - combination
51:14 - you know it's hacker afternoon so hacker
51:17 - where was the inspiration to call that
51:19 - one
51:20 - well let's just think about this okay
51:22 - why did you want to create on the
51:24 - something on the coding side
51:25 - right if you have not been affiliated so
51:27 - much in the coding site i know you're
51:28 - building websites and stuff like that
51:29 - but why
51:30 - you know create a publication you know
51:33 - people that read hacker noon for
51:35 - coding advice think hackernoon is just
51:37 - for coding
51:38 - you know the library is pretty big and
51:40 - we just kind of welcomed and we said hey
51:42 - you can publish anything about
51:44 - technology in an editor will review it
51:46 - and we'll distribute it
51:47 - and photos kind of just naturally
51:49 - emerged as kind of this
51:50 - underserved group that needs a little
51:52 - help with all their expertise needs to
51:54 - repackage it needs to have a better
51:56 - headline
51:56 - it was just a group of people that like
51:58 - fit the service i was offering
52:00 - really well so it wasn't to me it was
52:03 - just i
52:04 - wanted to create a technology site and
52:05 - say hey anything about technology you
52:07 - can publish here i want to create a site
52:08 - where you can learn anything and that's
52:10 - about technology and kind of have this
52:12 - vertical because i tried it with
52:14 - uh p.s i love you and poetry
52:18 - a marketing site and all these seo
52:20 - people and it was like the technology
52:22 - stuff is just more
52:24 - interesting and it's a better it's a
52:25 - better model and it's more people
52:27 - they're on their keyboard all day you
52:28 - know yeah the second women to read their
52:30 - stuff
52:31 - is always appreciated i love that and so
52:34 - basically they just your goal from what
52:37 - my perspective is your goal was not
52:39 - necessarily to
52:40 - just go ahead and attract you know
52:43 - developers
52:43 - your goal is to be able to attract
52:45 - anybody who want to be able to put on
52:47 - you know any article around technology
52:50 - in general
52:51 - it's just maybe because of the name the
52:53 - name number one
52:54 - and number two they're the lack of
52:58 - you know technology publication
53:00 - complicate publication companies there
53:03 - kind of brought them in just organically
53:05 - over time
53:06 - is that how i was uh that's pretty
53:09 - accurate
53:09 - um yeah pretty accurate and i i would
53:12 - just i mean
53:12 - i don't know if the other ones uh
53:14 - there's always a place to write but even
53:16 - over the last 10 years there's so many
53:18 - more places than there was 10 years ago
53:20 - so much easier to get a site live and as
53:22 - hard as ever to get people to visit your
53:24 - site
53:24 - you know so there's kind of that
53:26 - underserved thing of like okay what's
53:27 - the first thing when you do when you're
53:29 - trying to market a site well that other
53:30 - sites have to drive traffic to it that's
53:32 - right so there must be some trade-off
53:33 - there of like how do you build up
53:35 - you know your webs on the internet where
53:37 - you're bouncing traffic around to each
53:38 - other yeah so
53:39 - i think that was an underserved uh group
53:41 - and
53:42 - and the underservedness led for
53:44 - predatory behavior and central entities
53:46 - so like becoming the social network it's
53:49 - all this power like facebook steals all
53:51 - the power from the publishers
53:52 - and they're just saying hey we're
53:53 - deciding where the traffic goes
53:55 - which publisher we rank above another in
53:57 - a news feed
53:58 - and now that's a tough thing too they
54:00 - took advantage of the trend just
54:02 - much better of uniting the internet
54:04 - really fast but then it's their own
54:05 - vested interest of
54:06 - what stories they want to serve you and
54:08 - why and you're not getting hey what
54:10 - stories does this site want to serve me
54:12 - i think that's right okay okay okay i
54:14 - see i see
54:15 - so okay my interesting now portion okay
54:18 - is okay great so you went with hacker no
54:20 - you bought the domain name for 13
54:22 - which i think is really interesting and
54:24 - they are now
54:25 - serving you know uh you know a lot of
54:27 - people are posting articles
54:29 - i know this is what people want to hear
54:32 - or people want to know right now david
54:34 - okay
54:34 - there's one thing people want to know
54:35 - right now it is
54:38 - what technology did you use to build it
54:42 - right now no i mean before the first
54:44 - time
54:45 - the first hacker dude yeah medium
54:48 - medium.com
54:49 - we use their content manager oh really
54:52 - okay okay okay so it was me to come
54:53 - initially
54:54 - or they wanted people to just publish on
54:56 - medium.com
54:57 - when they started i thought medium.com
54:59 - was gonna set out to be
55:01 - right here publish everywhere and as
55:03 - they were bringing in all these back
55:04 - channel and big publishers
55:06 - i thought that's a great model for
55:08 - writers to publish many places
55:10 - and so i was uh much more bullish on
55:12 - their early software
55:13 - than uh whatever they're doing now
55:16 - gotcha and so
55:17 - what have what now did you use after
55:19 - that so
55:20 - uh firebase is our database so firebase
55:24 - and versal
55:24 - we're using both they're kind of our
55:26 - primary two databases right now
55:28 - um but a lot of different technologies
55:31 - we've plugged in there
55:32 - if you go to the about page there's like
55:34 - a big logo thing and you can see all of
55:35 - them and uh
55:36 - we're starting to open source more of
55:37 - them a lot of our own fonts um open we
55:40 - have a component thing coming up we have
55:42 - the free internet plug-in
55:43 - the text editor we used slate js and we
55:47 - also just built
55:48 - a new one with um outline so
55:51 - two different open for open source text
55:53 - editors that we kind of built and
55:54 - customize and add some different things
55:56 - in
55:57 - um yeah well a lot of different things
56:00 - floating around we designed our own
56:02 - emojis we open source those so there's
56:03 - like pixelated emojis so you can do
56:05 - different reactions you can take them
56:07 - use them however you want
56:08 - we pixelated all the social networks to
56:10 - kind of clown on them a little bit of
56:12 - like hey
56:12 - you can't put your perfect logo on our
56:14 - site and we're not putting your tracking
56:16 - pixel
56:17 - no you can't do that so there's some
56:20 - like
56:20 - we're tracking google and google's
56:22 - firebase anyway so if they want to
56:24 - steal our information they obviously you
56:26 - know whatever i mean they already have
56:27 - all the information it's okay
56:31 - there's always these trade-offs it's
56:32 - like oh can you afford a software that
56:33 - costs 20
56:34 - 000 a month or do you want to trade some
56:36 - of this information and go the google
56:38 - analytics trade-off across the whole web
56:40 - is like a remarkable growth strategy but
56:42 - i don't know how it's going to evolve
56:44 - you know i'd rather pay them more and
56:47 - have a little more
56:47 - control over that but we'll see how the
56:50 - internet
56:51 - kind of plays out hopefully more of
56:53 - these smaller companies start to emerge
56:55 - and not get sold right away and they
56:56 - start to emerge and prosper
56:58 - and we have a little more uh diversity
57:00 - of large tech companies at the top
57:02 - i love that and i see here in the
57:04 - comments lynn smoke is that that your
57:05 - wife
57:06 - links yeah right some link some smoke so
57:09 - she went ahead and she said
57:11 - basically what you guys are using is
57:12 - something called outline and next to yes
57:15 - versal firebase prisma and font awesome
57:19 - [Laughter]
57:24 - i like to ask that question because
57:25 - we're out with ahrefs uh we've got some
57:27 - stuff coming out with them
57:29 - uh-huh we got some stuff coming out with
57:31 - grammarly
57:32 - uh mm-hmm yeah
57:35 - you got web monetization floating around
57:37 - in there have you guys
57:38 - i mean so next i know next year is a
57:40 - react gs so
57:42 - you guys are using react.js kind of with
57:43 - next gs so
57:45 - first up gets into to go ahead are you
57:47 - guys you guys are using firebase
57:48 - actually fully do you guys use firebase
57:50 - um
57:50 - as well to uh put it on live as well
57:54 - uh it depends where it is in the product
57:56 - um but uh
57:57 - so more of the root domain is on versal
57:59 - and then app and different subdomains
58:01 - authentication firebase
58:03 - um storage and firebase a lot of user
58:06 - user data of around all the stories
58:09 - you know keeping the stories in a couple
58:11 - different places have a backup
58:12 - that's cool i know this is what a lot of
58:15 - you know developers like to hear it's
58:16 - like what technology they're using
58:18 - to learn about whatever technology is
58:20 - you know
58:22 - okay great so i don't know take it back
58:25 - to where we you know left off from which
58:26 - is
58:27 - okay you start this hack renewal thing
58:29 - and you start to see people coming in
58:31 - through there
58:31 - you know which point then you know what
58:33 - you realize that okay i want to take
58:34 - this a lot further
58:36 - and i want to focus in fully on that
58:40 - well with the equity crowdfunding we
58:41 - kind of opened up a software team and
58:43 - now
58:44 - we've doubled revenue three years in a
58:45 - row and we've passed last year's revenue
58:47 - pretty significantly already
58:49 - so we kind of opened up where we could
58:51 - hire a few more people and
58:52 - really in solving our own problems we
58:54 - want to build little different software
58:56 - applications
58:57 - so one of these is called slogging and
58:58 - you can see it at slogging.com
59:00 - and basically it's slack blogging and
59:02 - it's turning our own conversations into
59:04 - hacker noon post
59:05 - so this little app that we've been using
59:07 - internally and with some hacker noon
59:09 - writers
59:10 - so we published about 150 posts and it's
59:12 - about having a community discussion
59:14 - and then you click three buttons you
59:16 - turn it into a hacker noon draft editor
59:18 - reviews it and publishes it
59:20 - so that came out of our tech lead having
59:22 - 28 000
59:24 - slack updates in a year and only 12
59:25 - hacker noon posts and it was like okay
59:27 - that's not a good ratio
59:29 - all the great writing is sitting around
59:31 - yeah that no one reads
59:33 - so except us so that's kind of where the
59:36 - core of the idea came from and now it
59:37 - could go many different directions
59:39 - that's right i'm boarding kind of our
59:40 - first
59:41 - communities here um to try it out and
59:43 - start publishing it but it could become
59:45 - a standalone application where you can
59:47 - slog on your own site you know so right
59:49 - now it's all slogging on hacker noon
59:51 - um yeah and we kind of look to like
59:54 - solve our own solutions and then
59:56 - see if that software can be useful
59:58 - elsewhere
59:59 - so okay and so let me ask you this okay
60:02 - when you went ahead and get started and
60:03 - before you even hire your first engineer
60:05 - tell me you know who was working on it
60:07 - it was it just you
60:08 - or using your wife or is it just you
60:10 - yourself
60:11 - you know what was the kind of starting
60:13 - points there
60:14 - uh so outsourcing because software
60:16 - development was the first step and
60:18 - trying that and that didn't really work
60:20 - then i teamed up with jay zalowitz an
60:21 - engineer and uh
60:23 - helped scale a couple little
60:24 - applications about how to reach out and
60:27 - see what stories are trending and try
60:29 - and figure out ways to tell people this
60:30 - is a good place to publish
60:32 - and look at what's trending and use our
60:33 - insights about how you know once we
60:35 - start to rank for javascript terms now
60:37 - we have a little library here of like
60:39 - hey if you write about this
60:40 - you know it's gonna rank really well
60:42 - because we're building up our authority
60:43 - around this words
60:44 - so kind of that level of insight and
60:46 - editorial support was
60:48 - really helpful for getting these first
60:49 - group of contributors in and then
60:51 - feeling like someone else is on the
60:52 - other side of the screen and you know
60:54 - from there it was like me and part-time
60:56 - people for about a year and a half and
60:58 - then just me and ling for another year
61:00 - year and a half
61:01 - and then we did equity crowd funding
61:03 - extended the team
61:04 - uh then we did one strategic investment
61:06 - from coil
61:08 - to implement web monetization and kick
61:10 - off um a referral partnership with them
61:12 - about
61:13 - and coil is pretty cool because you pay
61:15 - coil five dollars
61:16 - and then anyone that's web monetized
61:18 - coil streams that five dollars to all
61:20 - the specific sites
61:21 - so all they do is add a meta tag to
61:23 - their site and we've had about 2 000
61:25 - writers they add that meta tag to their
61:27 - stories
61:28 - and they get streamed a couple pennies
61:30 - from that five dollar subscription
61:31 - so it's like trying to look for you know
61:34 - innovative technologies like that
61:35 - is pretty fun uh so so so so back to the
61:38 - undercoil thing what was the purpose for
61:40 - that
61:41 - uh the purpose is to create another
61:43 - feature for writers and try and be a
61:45 - part of
61:45 - more ways to monetize the content you
61:47 - own on the web okay we want to provide
61:49 - more opportunities to writers so that
61:51 - was like
61:51 - something we were pursuing as a
61:53 - strategic partnership and they believe
61:54 - in us and they want us to grow bigger
61:56 - so we reached um an agreement and uh
61:58 - raised a million dollars from coil
62:00 - kept our company entirely common stock
62:03 - priced it so it increased the value of
62:04 - the company from the
62:06 - equity crowdfunding and it's nice to get
62:08 - priced again like all the hard work i'm
62:10 - doing can someone evaluate this thing
62:11 - and look how cool it is
62:13 - there's nobody that nobody see what's
62:15 - going on here i'm working so hard every
62:17 - single day and nobody can see it
62:19 - [Laughter]
62:23 - it's that was really cool because the um
62:25 - the founder of coyle used to be the cto
62:27 - of ripple
62:28 - and he closed our equity crowdfunding
62:30 - round we were doing an event at get
62:33 - headquarters in san francisco i had
62:34 - never met him before the event ends and
62:37 - he just tweets out something like
62:38 - just ended just was the last investor in
62:40 - the hackernoon crowdfunding round and
62:42 - the round was over because it hit the
62:43 - cap
62:44 - so it was like a cool like and i just
62:47 - found out his dad
62:48 - also invested in the round independently
62:50 - of him
62:51 - crowdfunding yeah like a 60 70 year old
62:54 - guy that's just really excited about
62:56 - technology and reads the site
62:57 - that's like that's so cool does he know
63:00 - maybe making articles on the site or no
63:02 - is it just like no
63:02 - he doesn't he hasn't done his first one
63:04 - yet maybe i'll message him
63:08 - that'll be interesting that'd be
63:10 - interesting okay great so you were you
63:12 - know you guys did some crowdfunding
63:13 - and and at which point did you guys
63:16 - realize you know we need to hire now
63:17 - developers like in-house developers
63:20 - and did you have any difficulties around
63:22 - that
63:23 - uh yeah so we i mean whenever we wanted
63:26 - the equity crowd funding and pivot to
63:27 - our own software
63:28 - was all it's one thing it's saying hey
63:30 - if we don't control the software
63:32 - experience we don't control the site
63:34 - it's it's not our experience and people
63:35 - can steal it from us whenever they want
63:37 - you know or you're just locked into a
63:39 - shitty experience like
63:40 - if you tried to optimize our editorial
63:43 - flow within a wordpress
63:44 - it could be done but it would be a
63:46 - brutal amount of work yeah
63:48 - our experience and our workflow into
63:50 - your workflows right you've already
63:51 - wordpress has so many
63:53 - like the whole ecosystem it's built out
63:55 - it's there
63:56 - it's not exactly the most flexible to
63:59 - say my site works differently than yours
64:00 - yeah might
64:01 - interact differently than yours they
64:02 - need a different flow they need a
64:03 - different experience so
64:05 - that having that moment and having
64:07 - enough readers to believe in us to help
64:09 - us make that step
64:10 - and having enough sponsors to keep this
64:12 - thing going and it was
64:14 - that was definitely a tough move for us
64:16 - and we had to work really hard and
64:18 - hopefully come out the other side you
64:20 - know looking good and
64:22 - making a bunch more money and you know
64:24 - we have we have employees now for the
64:25 - first time buying houses which is super
64:27 - cool
64:28 - that's so cool we i think we had three
64:30 - uh so far this year of the 11
64:32 - uh you know go move into their own house
64:35 - so like that's super cool is like
64:37 - judging my impact on the world yeah you
64:39 - know
64:40 - you can we're working here as we're
64:42 - making enough money and have a good
64:43 - enough business that people can work
64:44 - here and improve their lives so
64:46 - yeah that's all that's always one of you
64:48 - know the biggest impact right even here
64:50 - clever programmer right when we went
64:52 - ahead and started you know clever
64:54 - programmer and it's like now seeing that
64:56 - you know you know
64:57 - one person you know is getting apartment
64:59 - in like in like you know it's
65:00 - and they're improving their life in that
65:02 - way another person is doing this they're
65:03 - putting off in that way
65:04 - it's always just it's so it makes it
65:08 - very different for why you do things
65:10 - like it makes it you know you realize
65:11 - that this is why you do the things that
65:13 - you do
65:14 - you know that as a team if you as a team
65:17 - can become successful and you run this
65:19 - business and
65:20 - you guys are all growing together
65:22 - everybody is growing together everybody
65:24 - you know
65:24 - either make you know getting better in
65:26 - their skills everybody is growing in
65:28 - terms of you know their standards in
65:29 - life
65:30 - you know they're getting better and you
65:32 - know happiness
65:33 - uh that's like i don't know i don't know
65:36 - if it gets better
65:37 - just in general you know that's that's
65:39 - pretty much what you want i feel i feel
65:41 - like in life
65:42 - i mean i i think more small sustainable
65:45 - internet businesses would be just a
65:46 - great place to be in
65:47 - the models right now is still very much
65:50 - too heavy of
65:51 - invest in an idea and then grow the idea
65:53 - and then sell the idea to somebody else
65:54 - and sell the thing so like i think if
65:56 - more people would look at
65:58 - internet longevity and try and say hey
66:00 - i'm a sustainable business i make more
66:01 - money each year
66:02 - maybe it goes up more maybe it goes up
66:04 - less but it's enough that it keeps
66:05 - growing
66:06 - and you own it in 10 years 20 years from
66:08 - now it's still a business with all the
66:10 - shareholders that actually grew it
66:12 - as opposed to saying hey it got bought
66:14 - out and put into the shelf onto someone
66:16 - else's product suite
66:17 - and the the essence is you know kind of
66:20 - sometimes that dies you know
66:22 - yeah those type of stages uh but back to
66:24 - the the other question you're asking our
66:26 - first engineers that we hired
66:28 - um the very first uh leader chief
66:30 - product
66:31 - officer we had as my one of my best
66:33 - friends and i had worked with him for
66:34 - eight years
66:35 - i was in the group at his wedding and he
66:37 - he
66:38 - i was actually a client of his when his
66:40 - old startup they actually hired me to do
66:42 - some
66:42 - writing and messaging for them his name
66:45 - is dane lyons and he
66:46 - he's since uh started his own company
66:49 - after rebuilding hackernoon
66:50 - um where he's doing v1 labs where he's
66:53 - building all these micro apps and
66:55 - doing a micro app with nfts right now
66:57 - that looks pretty cool nice
66:59 - so that and then he hired his old you
67:02 - know best pair programming
67:04 - so that was his first tire of like that
67:06 - so like there is
67:07 - like the referrals are really valuable
67:09 - in the beginning and then
67:10 - to me it's referrals and inbounds or
67:12 - like we're at the stage where that's all
67:13 - we need for
67:14 - people and all the early developers as
67:16 - companies get bigger
67:17 - they want to like hire recruiting firms
67:19 - and target specific skills and
67:21 - if i'm targeting anyone it's like me or
67:23 - ling and we're like reaching out talking
67:25 - to them figuring out like hey we admire
67:26 - you
67:27 - it's not like we're not paying anyone
67:29 - else to do that we're not paying for any
67:31 - like recruitment marketing ads or we're
67:32 - not going to career camps
67:34 - yeah and well no one's really going out
67:37 - and
67:37 - it's not kind of their career camps are
67:39 - coming back
67:41 - you're kind of like hey do you united do
67:42 - you know anybody do you anybody do you
67:44 - know anybody
67:46 - yeah i mean i i agree with that that's a
67:47 - really important aspect you know in
67:49 - hiring this is
67:50 - um and also i talk a lot about this too
67:53 - here on clever programmer on youtube and
67:55 - just in the boot camp in general a lot
67:57 - of times is guys your network is very
67:59 - important
67:59 - your network around who you know what
68:01 - you you know what you know
68:03 - is probably one of the most important
68:04 - things you can be as a developer it's
68:06 - really hard for example even for me
68:08 - when i was applying for jobs you know my
68:09 - first job that i got
68:11 - oh i look back at it and i'm like you
68:14 - know most of the jobs that i had were
68:15 - pretty much
68:16 - through referrals you know
68:19 - it's it's like yes i applied to a lot of
68:21 - these companies i went to all these
68:22 - interviews and so forth but
68:24 - the actual jobs i had were all through
68:25 - referrals and that i think this has a
68:26 - lot and so
68:27 - this is a lot about as well i mean
68:29 - coming from dave david here
68:30 - is guys a lot through referrals but i've
68:33 - actually never got a job
68:35 - through referrals i mean part of the
68:36 - point of this whole thing was to never
68:37 - have to apply to a job again
68:39 - and i just work for my own company um
68:41 - but the first job i actually got with
68:43 - smart recruiters
68:44 - i had been replying to all these jobs
68:46 - had no network as a 21 year old and just
68:48 - had like oh check out my little site bro
68:50 - i didn't have like much going on
68:54 - then what but what changed actually
68:56 - because i was doing the traditional
68:57 - cover letter and resume but then i just
68:59 - started reaching out on social networks
69:01 - and writing like three to four sentences
69:03 - about what i like about their business
69:04 - and how i could grow it wow that's
69:06 - actually how i
69:07 - i cold messaged i think through linkedin
69:09 - for smart recruiters
69:10 - and i just told the ceo what i like
69:12 - about the model that he's putting out
69:14 - and what i think i could
69:15 - grow and then i got a message back in
69:17 - like a day wow
69:18 - okay if you actually tell them something
69:20 - to help their business they're more
69:21 - likely to want to meet with you i know i
69:23 - know
69:24 - it's crazy how that works out ah when
69:26 - you want to help people they just
69:27 - respond you know
69:29 - so it's actually really interesting
69:32 - links literally just recently commented
69:34 - she said
69:34 - one of our employees recruit people from
69:37 - via hinge and tinder
69:40 - i couldn't comment on that i thought
69:42 - that was really interesting
69:44 - so okay great so you you guys went ahead
69:46 - and now you're hiring people
69:48 - tell me a little bit now in terms of
69:50 - what are some hardest what are the
69:52 - hardest things that you have faced
69:53 - potentially
69:54 - when trying to build this because of
69:56 - course like it or not there's always
69:58 - challenging times there's always
69:59 - difficult times what are those tough
70:01 - times
70:02 - you know because of course we've had
70:03 - some tough times of course i'm sure you
70:05 - have too
70:07 - um i mean there's the unpredictability
70:08 - of traffic on the internet and
70:10 - specifically google you know our top
70:12 - source of traffic is google
70:14 - and so like sometimes that goes up and
70:15 - down they change an algorithm or they
70:17 - favor one site over another
70:19 - so there's an element of like what's in
70:21 - your control and what's not
70:22 - you know as a business owner you want to
70:24 - spend your time doing things that are in
70:26 - your control and positively you know
70:28 - improving all this
70:29 - improving the growth the ceiling of your
70:31 - business but also
70:32 - you know raising the floor and patching
70:35 - all the problems
70:36 - so there's that element of like what you
70:38 - can control and what you can't and then
70:40 - so that's um something that i think
70:42 - i've worked on getting better at and
70:44 - just being um
70:46 - picking projects and doing doing things
70:48 - in a way where i'm i'm
70:49 - impacting the business on the things
70:51 - that i control because the bigger it
70:52 - gets the less i control
70:54 - the more people are out there just
70:55 - following and doing what they think
70:57 - their job is
70:58 - and the more it's just the things bigger
71:00 - it's not the same as hey all the labor
71:02 - going into it
71:03 - is me waking up and me sleeping and so
71:05 - getting over that like
71:07 - hump and how to be better at each stage
71:09 - of the business is definitely
71:10 - it's something i'm working on every day
71:12 - you know not just trusting like you know
71:14 - how to do your job go for it
71:16 - yeah i mean i'm guessing of course it's
71:17 - not easy you know as a ceo you have to
71:19 - be
71:19 - you have to know there's a lot of things
71:21 - you have to you have to be aware of
71:22 - right
71:23 - even when this when the team is smaller
71:25 - it doesn't matter
71:27 - there's actually even a feel like harder
71:28 - sometimes because there's a lot more
71:30 - communication you probably will have
71:32 - with the people that you work with um
71:34 - and then you have to be on this
71:35 - side and then this side so i definitely
71:37 - i definitely get that get that portion
71:39 - what about you know things around you
71:41 - know
71:42 - uh what is the best times do you see
71:43 - what are the things that you guys love
71:45 - when you're running a business like this
71:47 - i mean it's it's always nice to read the
71:49 - random actual kind comment on the
71:51 - internet
71:52 - i'm doing nothing and something kind of
71:54 - just popping up so there's a little
71:55 - there's some endorphins there and some
71:57 - vanity of just like
71:59 - sweet i'm working on this hard it's not
72:00 - just sustainable for the people working
72:02 - on it but the people using it are also
72:04 - gaining value and they're saying hey i'm
72:05 - glad this site exists
72:06 - and if hacker new didn't exist i
72:08 - wouldn't learn that or hacker noon i
72:10 - published here and i got my job later
72:11 - there
72:12 - so like little wins that happen in your
72:14 - life like
72:15 - just cherish them you know as an
72:16 - entrepreneur it's like most of it is
72:18 - just running your head against the wall
72:20 - and moving the wall like slightly
72:21 - forward
72:22 - and so like when the flowers come you
72:24 - know like smell them
72:25 - take your time enjoy it so those are
72:27 - great i mean working from home
72:29 - you know i've been remote i had the
72:31 - first i had an office on flood street in
72:33 - san francisco and then
72:34 - when i had my daughter and got married i
72:36 - moved out to the country in colorado
72:39 - so just being able to work remotely with
72:40 - my wife and be in fresh air and be
72:43 - thankful to set up a good support system
72:45 - and
72:46 - uh sit in my own home office and you
72:48 - know type here
72:49 - like setting up a life that uh makes my
72:51 - work better uh so i think that stuff is
72:53 - really
72:54 - a lot to be thankful for and i mean a
72:56 - lot more people are getting it now with
72:57 - remote jobs but it's still
72:58 - a ton of back and forth and people get a
73:01 - job but they have to show up these
73:02 - places they have to work remotely
73:04 - sometimes in the office others
73:06 - and the pandemic accelerated all this
73:08 - but just having a good healthy remote
73:10 - work setup is something i'm
73:12 - extremely thankful for no i agree i
73:15 - agree remote from all work has been
73:17 - amazing i mean with when kobe started
73:19 - yeah it's been great it allowed me to a
73:21 - lot of us to focus as well
73:22 - you know uh but sometimes i mean for me
73:25 - personally like i love remote work and i
73:27 - love being a hobo sometimes like oh my
73:28 - god i cannot i cannot
73:30 - not wait to get out of the kit out you
73:31 - know yeah
73:33 - it's healthy to walk a lot and have your
73:35 - other go-to places
73:36 - um and i mean i i don't we don't have an
73:39 - office right now but i wouldn't rule it
73:41 - out forever like having a small office
73:43 - and mixing it up and having a couple
73:44 - people meet there that'd be interesting
73:46 - yeah especially if you get to do youtube
73:49 - when you guys had to collaborate
73:50 - together like for me the collaboration
73:51 - portion is always the most important
73:53 - portion
73:53 - you know if you wanted to make videos
73:55 - and collaborate and that's like that's
73:57 - how when all the brains come together
73:59 - and that's when you know magic happens
74:01 - [Laughter]
74:03 - so let me ask you this okay
74:06 - you've been you've done some amazing
74:07 - things now with hacker noon
74:09 - um you do some amazing things right now
74:11 - where do you see the future
74:12 - of hacking on of hacker know now at this
74:15 - point
74:16 - so we want to continue down the path
74:18 - we're on becoming a better place to read
74:20 - write learn and publish
74:21 - and learn anything about technology and
74:23 - be this massive free resource
74:25 - i want to do a better job of reflecting
74:27 - the technology industry
74:29 - so that means you know right now we've
74:31 - done a good job of leveling up the
74:32 - people that are building and providing
74:34 - them with a voice on the internet and
74:36 - leveling up that voice and getting more
74:38 - discussion around the things that the
74:39 - people are actually building it or
74:41 - thinking about
74:42 - so we want to also hold the tech
74:44 - companies a little more account
74:45 - accountable and also empower them to
74:48 - like tell their story next to the whole
74:50 - web
74:50 - so we build tech company news pages
74:53 - where we're aggregating the discussion
74:55 - around every tech company and what
74:57 - they're talking about on the internet
74:58 - and what people are talking about them
74:59 - on hacker noon
75:00 - so a little bit of that like the
75:02 - character that greases all these wheels
75:04 - is the technology company themselves
75:06 - they're the ones making the revenue
75:07 - they're the ones finding it they're the
75:08 - industry that's growing
75:10 - head over foot as every industry needs
75:12 - more technology help and more
75:13 - technology abilities so there's we want
75:15 - to get a little better at that and kind
75:17 - of look more towards like how
75:19 - terminal works for bloomberg or how
75:21 - crunchbase worked for techcrunch
75:23 - so a little more there and then more
75:25 - opportunities for contributors
75:26 - and saying hey contributors you can plug
75:28 - in your coil meta tag
75:30 - you can get subscribers for your
75:31 - newsletter here you can drive traffic to
75:33 - book a call and get paid to book calls
75:35 - or book a customer
75:37 - and say hey get a demo of my software so
75:39 - more
75:40 - explanation of who these people are and
75:42 - what actions they want on the internet
75:44 - so to help them out and then for the
75:45 - readers just more customization of
75:48 - getting the content you want the larger
75:49 - this library gets
75:50 - the harder it is to get to the thing you
75:52 - actually want it's like
75:53 - there's more ways to get into the
75:55 - library but it gets complicated so
75:57 - that recommended stories that clean user
75:59 - experience that
76:00 - customization of hacker noon to making
76:02 - it your own and picking your own tags
76:04 - and getting recommended the stories you
76:06 - want and not the ones you don't
76:08 - so and just building more softwares that
76:11 - like we reuse elsewhere
76:13 - and looking at solving our own problems
76:15 - and creating these assets that we can
76:17 - open source or build a company or build
76:19 - a little team around
76:20 - and hey this this proves enough
76:22 - promising that we have like our own
76:24 - voting software
76:25 - and you know we vote this thing to vote
76:27 - on all the best contributors and have
76:28 - these awards around the internet and get
76:30 - sponsors to give things to the awards
76:32 - and it's like
76:32 - cool that's another we could use this
76:34 - voting software for many other things
76:36 - yeah like on startup of the year for
76:38 - every startup in the world which we're
76:39 - going to do
76:40 - so there's that's um kind of where we're
76:42 - going i just want to spend my time
76:44 - making it a better place to read write
76:46 - and learn
76:46 - and just build more software and that's
76:48 - kind of what i'm focused on
76:50 - and bringing in you know more stories
76:52 - about technology i love that i love that
76:54 - and so for you i'm just very curious
76:57 - right
76:58 - you loved you know building companies
77:00 - you love building software
77:02 - have you what what is your say on no you
77:05 - have you coded i'm just curious like
77:07 - have you
77:08 - put went down into that into that dark
77:10 - hole of coding or no
77:12 - i can open a terminal and like spit some
77:15 - stuff through
77:16 - and i can customize html i can inspect
77:19 - and look at css
77:20 - and play with it and move it let's go
77:26 - i'm at best of shitty coder i know just
77:29 - enough about it to talk to a software
77:31 - developer
77:31 - just enough just barely do you enjoy
77:34 - that i'm just curious
77:36 - um i enjoy more of the process of
77:38 - thinking about ripping stuff
77:40 - up and how software can grow and now
77:42 - that the ecosystem gets bigger
77:44 - the implementation of new feature is as
77:46 - important as the new feature
77:47 - and how does it fit with every other
77:48 - piece of software where are the
77:50 - integration points
77:51 - where are you cannibalizing traffic why
77:53 - is it leaving where could you put this
77:55 - instead those questions and like
77:57 - throwing something in and looking at the
77:59 - results and looking at the numbers and
78:01 - then seeing if i need to rip it out or
78:02 - how i could change it
78:04 - that that's more of where i get um the
78:06 - brain
78:07 - juice and the euphoria the creative word
78:09 - that it's like
78:10 - it's fun to break it and it's fun to fix
78:12 - it it's fun to break it
