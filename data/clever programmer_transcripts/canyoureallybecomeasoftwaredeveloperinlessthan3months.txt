00:18 - all
00:20 - right looks like we are
00:25 - live how is everybody whoa people are
00:29 - already here
00:30 - here
00:32 - damn this is dope how are you guys doing
00:42 - today let me just uh roll up my sleeves
00:45 - so I could get ready for this
00:48 - thing normally I don't wear my
00:51 - glasses who's calling
00:54 - me but you know it actually looks kind
00:58 - of cool so I decided to wear it in this
01:02 - live
01:03 - stream
01:06 - whoa lots of people hey uh theone guy
01:12 - Ajax 7-Eleven show be I got you Adam
01:15 - Hicks beu SAA what's up solution
01:19 - board uh lots of people coming in this
01:21 - is
01:25 - exciting all right uh how's your guys
01:28 - day going so far but uh so I just want
01:31 - to tell you guys that today what I want
01:33 - to be talking about so you guys know
01:35 - what we're going to be covering and what
01:37 - kind of value you're going to get is
01:40 - really the job opportunity that exists
01:43 - uh for software Developers for software
01:46 - consultants for
01:48 - Freelancers
01:51 - programmers and it exists even
01:55 - especially for those who are looking to
01:57 - get in this field and I'm also going to
01:59 - talk about how you can break into this
02:02 - field right right now you may be a
02:06 - techsavvy person or somebody in it or
02:10 - somebody in a job maybe Uber maybe
02:12 - something else but you're looking to
02:14 - make that transition right you're like
02:17 - hey I think programming is pretty
02:19 - interesting it has caught my attention
02:21 - it's kind of taking over the world by
02:25 - storm but how do I make that switch how
02:29 - do I go from currently where I'm at to a
02:34 - job of a software developer you know
02:37 - that comes with all its perks of being
02:39 - able to work remotely being able to do
02:42 - meaningful impactful work right you
02:46 - create an app that's a solution for
02:48 - millions of people that's pretty
02:51 - amazing so how do you kind of go about
02:55 - and do that how do you become a
02:58 - programmer because one of my problems
03:01 - which is the reason for clever
03:03 - programmer one of my problems was okay
03:06 - great you're teaching me all this stuff
03:08 - there's a lot of knowledge and value
03:10 - that I'm getting from these online
03:12 - courses from websites like corsera
03:15 - Udacity
03:16 - edex team Treehouse code academy but
03:21 - who's going to teach me how do I
03:23 - actually make that transition from what
03:25 - I'm currently doing to actually
03:27 - programming where do I go from my first
03:29 - job what do I do before I get my first
03:32 - job because even if you look on the
03:33 - resume of the first job what does it say
03:36 - you need one year or 6 months of
03:39 - experience and you're like what the hell
03:40 - I thought this was an intern or Junior
03:42 - developer job so how do I get that
03:45 - experience without actually being able
03:47 - to do a
03:49 - job you know so those are the questions
03:52 - that weren't really answered for
03:56 - me
03:57 - and boom clever programmer was born and
04:02 - we just broke past 50,000 subscribers so
04:06 - I am really really really excited about
04:08 - that thank you guys so much the love is
04:15 - unreal ah
04:17 - KSP haven't seen my face in a
04:21 - while let's
04:23 - see every time I see you I think of from
04:27 - the TV show Catfish hm H I don't know if
04:30 - that's a good thing or a bad
04:37 - thing oh yeah sorry my voice is g to be
04:41 - off I forgot to do that little thing
04:44 - where you sync your voice before going
04:47 - live and now I don't want to go unlive
04:50 - because I'm live and it's recording so
04:53 - I'm sorry we're going to just roll with
04:55 - it if it bother if it's bothering you a
04:57 - lot I would suggest maybe just listening
05:00 - but uh hopefully um you'll pull you're
05:03 - you'll push
05:08 - through wow bambul says I started with
05:11 - Python 3 days ago and I'm already on
05:13 - your 20th
05:17 - video okay great job that's um a lot of
05:21 - dedication and persistence you know um
05:24 - one of the things I want to share with
05:25 - you guys today I also want to give you
05:27 - the kazi's ultimate 8020 rule okay it's
05:32 - my super
05:34 - secret uh incredibly powerful rule that
05:39 - has helped me personally in um learning
05:42 - and getting lots of skills really fast
05:45 - and I've seen it work really well for
05:49 - others and the rule is like this a lot
05:52 - of people ask
05:54 - me I want to become really good at
05:57 - programming how do I do it what what's
05:59 - the 820 where do I focus the most and
06:02 - where do I focus less and here's my 820
06:06 - it's it's kind of funny but um it's
06:09 - incredibly powerful and my 8020 is 80
06:13 - play 20 learn and
06:16 - study okay it's a very simple 80 and
06:20 - 20 why do I say
06:22 - that literally look at any um any little
06:28 - baby who's trying to
06:31 - learn um how they're they go about
06:33 - learning a language how they go about um
06:36 - walking learning how to walk which is a
06:39 - pretty complicated process learning a
06:40 - language is pretty complicated or uh you
06:43 - know a baby cub you know um they'll run
06:47 - around they'll start figuring it out
06:50 - like they'll play around the most right
06:52 - that's what babies and kids do a lot and
06:55 - that's why they learn so
06:57 - fast if you spend time playing with
07:00 - something and enjoying it then what
07:02 - happens is that your brain is wired to
07:06 - enjoy that thing and what you enjoy you
07:09 - want to do it's not work it doesn't have
07:12 - to be on your schedule it's something
07:14 - that you just want to do but then it
07:18 - happens to also be part of your work so
07:20 - you're kind of tricking yourself
07:22 - too but yeah uh that's how you're going
07:25 - to become incredibly proficient because
07:27 - if you can play and enjoy in in a
07:30 - programming language like python then
07:32 - forget about the ultimate power that you
07:35 - get when um you know you actually start
07:39 - putting some work ethic into it it's
07:40 - like putting work ethic in something
07:42 - that you enjoy you know uh that 15
07:45 - year-old kid who plays Call of Duty for
07:49 - 20 hours a day right that's like
07:53 - something that he loves but then imagine
07:55 - the people who turn into professional
07:56 - Gamers it's something that they enjoy
07:59 - right that's what they've been doing
08:01 - playing and now it's turn into a
08:02 - profession incredibly fun nothing gets
08:05 - better right that's an ultimate
08:08 - lifestyle same thing here I would
08:10 - suggest play kind of feel it out you
08:12 - know learn it just enjoy it and then
08:14 - you'll naturally just be doing it
08:16 - without kind of
08:18 - knowing um okay so you know something
08:22 - that I want to I also want to talk about
08:24 - is the job opportunity and the growth in
08:27 - the software development industry right
08:29 - that's this is kind of where the world
08:31 - is headed everything around you that you
08:33 - see is controlled by software from
08:37 - hospitals to cars to automated vehicles
08:41 - to that like blender that I have at home
08:44 - to the Amazon button that I press and I
08:46 - get my coffee without having to think or
08:49 - do anything to Alexa you can even
08:52 - program Alexa right uh I don't know if
08:55 - you guys know but Alexa's voice skills
08:57 - are actually programmable and you can
08:58 - tap into to it and you know do some fun
09:01 - stuff and code it up but of course you
09:03 - have to know about programming to be
09:04 - able to do those things so everything is
09:07 - kind of softwar driven right and what
09:10 - controls software people who do
09:13 - programming so how I think of it is you
09:16 - take the world's smartest thing a
09:18 - computer and with its computing power
09:21 - and when you Lo programming you
09:23 - essentially know how to speak with it so
09:25 - now if you're best friends with the most
09:28 - powerful person in the world you get a
09:31 - lot of power too so when you're friends
09:34 - with programming right you spend time
09:36 - playing around with it and just picking
09:37 - it up you're in turn pretty powerful
09:43 - yourself
09:45 - um another thing I wanted to kind of
09:48 - show you guys was you know along with
09:50 - the job opportunity right so the job
09:52 - opportunity and the growth that you get
09:54 - in this industry that's it's booming and
09:56 - it has uh you know n basically uh I
09:59 - don't know what the St I can't remember
10:01 - what the stats are but something like um
10:05 - 400,000 job positions are open but only
10:08 - like a few thousand people are
10:10 - graduating in computer science so you
10:12 - know you have that window to then join
10:15 - and uh be a
10:18 - programmer because there's just so many
10:20 - people not filling in those spots right
10:23 - and uh it's the trend so catching a
10:26 - trend is also something that's helpful
10:28 - let me see if
10:29 - there are questions that I can
10:34 - take got do eat area right now Ramadan
10:38 - mabarak NZ Hassan uh it's probably
10:41 - really late um where nazmul is and uh
10:46 - for all the Muslims you know when you're
10:49 - fasting um at night before the sunrises
10:53 - right around 3:00 a.m. or something like
10:55 - that you have to eat so then you can you
10:58 - know Sur survive the rest of the day for
11:01 - like 18 hours and not be hungry or
11:05 - thirsty uh which is going to happen but
11:07 - if you eat around 2: 3:00 a.m. then it
11:09 - kind of lessens
11:11 - that all right
11:15 - so uh let me show you guys I'm going to
11:19 - I'm going to take you behind the scenes
11:21 - and show you some freelancing
11:22 - opportunities that exist right because
11:24 - my goal for you guys is not just to
11:26 - learn programming but actually
11:29 - actually have a job in programming right
11:32 - so the reason why I focus a lot on
11:35 - things like freelancing working with
11:37 - clients is so then it's a perfect
11:39 - transition
11:42 - into getting a job as a software
11:44 - developer full-time okay if that's your
11:47 - goal if it's not you can be perfectly
11:50 - fine working as a
11:51 - freelancer so what I'm going to do is
11:54 - I'm going to share my screen and just
11:55 - take you guys behind the scenes and uh a
11:58 - lot of this stuff maybe won't even make
12:00 - that much sense but I just want to show
12:01 - you some simple stuff that you can
12:03 - actually be doing in a month or even
12:06 - less you know of learning
12:10 - programming so hopefully my screen share
12:13 - works fine I think it is so right now
12:16 - I'm on this website called upwork.com
12:18 - okay so this is a place where you can go
12:21 - and find freelancing work and all I've
12:24 - done here is I've gone here and I've
12:27 - just typed in like python jobs okay so
12:30 - python jobs and it says
12:33 - 1,157 were found on my criteria and
12:36 - these are the current jobs you know
12:38 - things that were posted 6 hours ago and
12:40 - blah blah blah
12:42 - now for this you don't really need any
12:46 - experience right uh you need skill to do
12:49 - them but you don't necessarily need
12:51 - experience so for example if you are
12:54 - picking up python skills the things I'm
12:56 - going to be teaching you in my upcoming
12:58 - course right it's called create apps
13:00 - with
13:01 - python if you know python skills then
13:04 - what happens is that you can go here and
13:06 - be like maybe I can't do this Sur surata
13:11 - fine-tuning whatever the heck that is
13:13 - but or or tensor flow because that's
13:15 - like machine learning super you know
13:17 - crazy stuff going on there but something
13:19 - simple which you know frontend developer
13:22 - with python skill and all that means is
13:24 - literally somebody who takes websites
13:27 - and makes them better look
13:29 - okay so this is something that's not
13:32 - complicated at all and you can learn it
13:34 - in less than a month and actually be
13:36 - doing this job and getting paid for it
13:38 - and putting it on your portfolio Okay uh
13:41 - some other tasks a python flask that's
13:44 - another task that I'm actually going to
13:47 - I'm going to be showing you guys some of
13:48 - flask in the course as well so this is a
13:50 - thing that you will actually be able to
13:52 - do uh from my course or even if you look
13:55 - up online some stuff you might be in a
13:57 - position where you can actually do
14:00 - these okay um and again this doesn't
14:04 - take years of learning software
14:07 - development that's why I'm so much you
14:10 - know hands I focus on being Hands-On so
14:12 - it's better to be Hands-On for you and
14:14 - get
14:15 - started and then learn um as you go
14:18 - along okay and then maybe there's some
14:20 - stuff where it's like okay maybe I don't
14:22 - want to do this or I don't know how to
14:23 - do this and then you just kind of scroll
14:25 - through and then go on to the next pages
14:27 - right um
14:29 - again let me get out of here and go back
14:33 - to my
14:34 - phase you know I always talk about in my
14:37 - Instagram post and all of
14:39 - that python is being used everywhere
14:42 - that's kind of the reason why I choose
14:44 - python to teach because it's the it's
14:46 - one of the simplest it's one of the most
14:48 - paid and it's one of the most uh used
14:51 - and highly trending right it took over
14:54 - java in popularity in
14:57 - 2016 right right and it's growing on a
15:01 - really high upwards Trend so those three
15:03 - things make it a really powerful deadly
15:05 - combo and who's using it you have Google
15:08 - that's using it you have Spotify that's
15:11 - using it you have Reddit using python
15:14 - you have Instagram using
15:16 - python even scientists at Nasa are using
15:19 - python so you know basically this should
15:22 - tell you that you can use it for things
15:24 - like Maps websites frontend development
15:27 - backend development right frontend just
15:29 - means when you click a button on the
15:31 - website and how beautiful things look on
15:33 - a website back end is kind of the logic
15:35 - of the website okay and you can use
15:37 - Python for all of that and so if all of
15:40 - these big companies are using it and
15:42 - it's a at a high upwards Trend and it's
15:46 - easy that to me is a very healthy uh and
15:51 - and and a sign of a very powerful
15:53 - language to start learning and jump on
15:56 - that trend
15:59 - right all right um I am going to take
16:03 - some questions
16:08 - here C okay so Ghost Rider says CSS
16:13 - easy yes CSS um yes and no most stuff
16:17 - honestly is easy um if you want to make
16:21 - it hard it can get hard right uh
16:24 - because all of these things go a lot
16:27 - deeper but you can start from day one um
16:31 - I I've competed in chess I've competed
16:33 - in table tennis tournaments and pretty
16:35 - soon I'm going to be competing in
16:36 - fighting tournaments I've been doing
16:38 - lots of jiujitsu lots of uh
16:43 - muai and uh not too much actually of the
16:47 - MU Thai and I've started doing boxing as
16:49 - well so I'm going to be competing in a
16:50 - jiu-jitsu tournament but what I want to
16:53 - tell you is that for a lot of these
16:55 - things you don't need a ton of
16:57 - experience when you when you compete in
17:00 - chess they put you against players of
17:01 - your own level when you compete in table
17:04 - tennis you can start in a month they put
17:06 - you in in with
17:08 - people that are at your level and that's
17:10 - how you learn the fastest as
17:14 - well now bringing this to the world of
17:17 - python and
17:19 - programming jumping into the freelancing
17:21 - world is the equivalent of that right
17:23 - and my course and my training prepares
17:26 - you for how do you handle your client
17:29 - where do you get your clients how to
17:32 - talk to your clients what's a psychology
17:34 - that you should know how much coding do
17:37 - you need to know what should your skill
17:39 - level be at before you jump into
17:42 - something like
17:44 - this where should you spend more time
17:46 - focusing meaning focus more time on
17:49 - finding jobs or focus more time on
17:53 - learning right learning versus earning
17:56 - and in my course I have this one thing
17:59 - that I show you that's the perfect
18:01 - intersection of learning and earning at
18:03 - the same time okay so that I I also
18:06 - showing my course anybody who's
18:09 - interested in the course the link is
18:11 - right below this video okay the link is
18:14 - in the description box it says l pages.
18:18 - c python op create apps okay that's the
18:20 - course so what you want to do is you
18:22 - want to go to that
18:24 - page click the sign up button and then
18:27 - what happens is you get on the wait list
18:30 - and the course is going to be launching
18:32 - in just a few days it's launching in
18:34 - four 1 two 3 4 four days
18:40 - okay and I want you to be there I want
18:43 - you to be a part of it so the course
18:45 - launches in 4 days but you get a few
18:48 - things when you join it when you join it
18:51 - I also give you uh even when you join
18:53 - the waiting list okay waiting list to
18:55 - join it is free it's basically me
18:57 - notifying you as soon as it's over open
18:59 - but you also get when you join the
19:01 - waiting list you get my top free coding
19:04 - resources that help me become a software
19:06 - developer in less than three
19:09 - months okay and you can also join my
19:14 - free python course so that will give you
19:16 - an idea of what to expect from uh the
19:20 - create apps with python course that's
19:23 - coming
19:26 - up h m
19:34 - um MD alaman taking a quick job at
19:38 - upwork it's not so quick because you
19:41 - basically have to kind of apply to it
19:42 - right and then you have to go through
19:44 - the process of U they most people who
19:47 - post jobs um I have also posted jobs on
19:51 - upwork and I've hired lots of people and
19:54 - basically how it works
19:56 - is you
20:00 - um generally you have multiple people
20:03 - that apply and then you interview
20:05 - multiple people so from so since you're
20:08 - going to be on the end of the person
20:09 - who's applying you're one person against
20:12 - a few other people so getting chosen
20:16 - from those people is also you know takes
20:18 - a little time doesn't happen instantly
20:21 - sometimes it might but for a job with
20:24 - programming you'll get lots of
20:25 - programmers applying to it so then you
20:28 - know there's a lot of uh uh there's some
20:32 - you have to like understand something
20:33 - called positioning so how do you
20:35 - position yourself so somebody picks you
20:38 - over somebody else it's basically
20:39 - standing out from the crowd okay that's
20:42 - something I drill down in a lot uh
20:45 - especially in my course because again
20:49 - these are just not skills that are
20:50 - taught by anybody like any software
20:53 - development people and I don't know why
20:55 - because it's one of the most important
20:57 - thing most people just want to teach you
20:59 - technical things and that's great but
21:01 - you know it reminds me of my act in high
21:04 - school I had a terrible act but I had
21:07 - really good grades and I was taking high
21:10 - level
21:11 - classes and it's not act and United
21:14 - States is the standardized test to test
21:17 - your intelligence or whatever your
21:19 - proficiency but the the weird part about
21:22 - it is
21:23 - that really the only way to get good at
21:25 - Act is you have to get good at Act okay
21:29 - even though it's a standardized Tesla
21:31 - that's supposed to test your knowledge
21:33 - you don't get good at it by being smart
21:35 - you get good at it by just uh practicing
21:38 - and taking the act for for months and
21:40 - months and that's how you kind of get
21:42 - good at It ultimately it's pattern
21:45 - recognition so since I was really doing
21:48 - good in all these classes I got a lower
21:50 - and I was like whoa you know why did
21:52 - that happen I don't get it but then you
21:54 - know lots of my friends explained it to
21:55 - me the teachers and stuff also explained
21:58 - this to me and then I kind of learned
21:59 - about it um as I you know grew up and I
22:02 - was like wow that's uh really weird and
22:04 - that kind of sucks
22:06 - but the reason why I'm making that
22:09 - connection is that's how the job world
22:11 - is as well it doesn't really matter how
22:14 - be uh skilled you
22:17 - become if you are not good at
22:21 - positioning yourself or marketing
22:23 - yourself right marketing might sound
22:24 - like a sleazy word but I'll show you how
22:27 - to do that without being being sleazy or
22:29 - coming off as a weirdo uh anything like
22:33 - that you kind of have to know certain
22:36 - things uh and that's how you get good at
22:40 - the process of applying at jobs and then
22:42 - standing out from the rest of the
22:44 - crowd with uh a a portfolio that you can
22:49 - be proud of okay and in the start you
22:52 - might not have that big of a portfolio
22:55 - that's why you need to get good at those
22:57 - skills so then you can start getting
22:58 - your hands dirty and start building up
23:00 - that portfolio as fast as possible okay
23:03 - that's another one of the things that we
23:05 - cover in the course how to start
23:07 - building your
23:13 - portfolio beu um the course O course the
23:18 - reason why you can't find it is because
23:20 - it's closed right now that course opens
23:23 - from June 26th through June 29th it
23:26 - opens for 3 days and then it goes away
23:29 - again and it doesn't open up the reason
23:32 - why I do this is because I take a cohort
23:35 - a group of students and then I focus all
23:37 - my energy there I don't want to spend
23:39 - time marketing I don't want to spend
23:41 - time you know constantly having to
23:43 - promote it once I have students in there
23:46 - I want to focus me the team at clever
23:49 - programmer um I I want the entire
23:52 - company to focus on those groups of
23:55 - students that join the course okay so
23:57 - you get our ultimate
23:59 - support uh that's kind of the reason why
24:02 - it opens up and then it kind of closes
24:04 - down so it's going to open up 26th uh in
24:07 - 4 days and then it's going to close on
24:10 - the 29th so right now it's currently
24:14 - closed and you can join the waiting list
24:17 - by clicking on the link below and when
24:19 - you join that waiting list you get a
24:20 - gift from me right something I've
24:22 - explained earlier but you get my top
24:24 - free coding
24:26 - resources so that's what I would suggest
24:29 - if you're interested in the course click
24:31 - that you know um even if you're not
24:33 - looking to buy it I mean you can even
24:35 - still get a lot of value out of it cuz
24:38 - all the other material I'm giving you is
24:40 - free okay so even if you are not looking
24:44 - to purchase it right now you can click
24:46 - on it and then learn more about it but
24:48 - the reason why I suggest you do things
24:52 - uh and take action immediately is
24:54 - because you don't want to get in a habit
24:56 - of just in action it's literally the
24:58 - worst thing you can do so if it is I
25:02 - don't want to do it then don't do it but
25:03 - if it is that you want to do it or
25:05 - you're curious then act now
25:09 - because you know a lot of these things
25:12 - the trend and the Technologies change so
25:15 - what that means is not that python won't
25:18 - be a safe language or software
25:20 - development will all of a sudden switch
25:22 - and there will be no need for
25:24 - programmers but what it does mean is
25:26 - that you know how lucrative it is is
25:28 - right now maybe it'll still be lucrative
25:30 - but not as much right so uh waiting
25:34 - isn't going to uh necessarily help you I
25:37 - don't care if you learn from me or
25:39 - anybody else my ultimate goal is just to
25:43 - teach people the art of computer
25:45 - programming understand why it's so
25:47 - powerful get them to see where the trend
25:49 - is headed and hopefully we'll have more
25:52 - people who become software developers
25:54 - cuz for me personally we're you know one
25:58 - of the biggest reasons why I started the
25:59 - channel was cuz I saw all my friends
26:01 - when I when you know earlier when I was
26:03 - going to college I saw them constantly
26:05 - quit because it was just being the
26:06 - taught the wrong way um the professors
26:09 - were kind of killing it for the students
26:12 - or the universities were preparing
26:14 - students in a way that wasn't applicable
26:16 - to the real world so when these students
26:18 - came out and graduated they couldn't
26:22 - actually get hired and that was
26:24 - extremely discouraging plus they had
26:26 - $50,000 worth of loans
26:32 - right um and and let me just give you
26:34 - another thing why I hate inaction so
26:36 - much and you should too is um I don't
26:40 - know if you guys have ever looked into
26:42 - this but I got very curious I wanted to
26:45 - know how you know sloths how sloths
26:49 - survive for so
26:51 - long cuz they're like these super lazy
26:55 - ugly looking little creatures I mean
26:57 - they're kind of cute sometimes right
26:58 - baby slots but they're so slow so how
27:02 - did they stand the test of time and
27:04 - through Evolution they got to live till
27:07 - today and survive right it takes them
27:11 - like 10 years to travel like one
27:14 - block so I finally looked it up I'd been
27:17 - curious about it for very long and then
27:19 - I finally looked it up and the actual
27:22 - reason why to survive is uh is this
27:28 - and they live to be 20 to 30 years old
27:30 - so for animals that's a pretty long time
27:32 - so the reason why they survive is
27:34 - because they're sitting they live on
27:37 - like the higher
27:39 - branches and the animals that are on
27:42 - those branches they're not interested in
27:45 - eating them because they're smaller
27:47 - animals and also they just don't like
27:51 - slots um and the animals that are the
27:54 - bottom who are the stronger ones when
27:56 - they try to get up there
27:58 - they outweigh the branches meaning they
28:00 - end up breaking the branches so they
28:02 - can't you know go up on the tree to get
28:05 - to the
28:06 - slots and that's how sloths
28:12 - survive
28:14 - right they survive by just
28:19 - existing so my question to you is do you
28:23 - want to live a life where you survive by
28:26 - existing
28:28 - right or do you want to be do you want
28:31 - more from life than that cuz I
28:34 - personally got tired of uh of making
28:37 - choices by default right like you accept
28:40 - a job just because that was like some
28:43 - recruiter called you and uh that was the
28:46 - only option you had at the time and so
28:48 - you just kind of went with it or how
28:50 - many times have you heard people applied
28:52 - to a college or or or or or accepted a
28:55 - offer from a college because that was
28:57 - like the only offer that was kind of
28:58 - given to them or that was the only
29:01 - college that they applied to right um or
29:04 - they got in a relationship because it
29:07 - was like that only girl or the guy uh
29:10 - asked them you know so we go through
29:15 - life a lot of the times making choices
29:17 - by default and by Def default choices
29:20 - are usually not the best
29:22 - choices um you know I chose the field of
29:26 - computer networking earlier and and I
29:28 - absolutely hated it but I chose it cuz I
29:33 - it was kind of by default you know my
29:34 - oldest brother did computer networking
29:36 - so I'm like okay maybe I'll give it a
29:38 - try right and uh because I had a fear of
29:42 - choosing things by default I started at
29:44 - a younger age looking into different
29:46 - fields and different jobs that I could
29:49 - do because I didn't want to be at a job
29:51 - that I hated and then you know8 hours a
29:54 - day 8 hours a day Shuffle that paper
29:57 - tedious work you know busting your
29:59 - brains eight hours a day you know not
30:02 - giving uh enough attention to your
30:03 - family your friends you know getting
30:06 - your soul crushed out eight hours a day
30:10 - so those are some of my reasons why um I
30:14 - chose to kind of look outside think
30:16 - outside the box and then find and create
30:19 - work opportunities that choose to serve
30:21 - me rather than the other way around
30:23 - that's why I'm able to spend time you
30:26 - know helping you guys out as well
30:30 - um and create these YouTube videos and
30:33 - then be on the YouTube channel you know
30:35 - because that's something that I love to
30:37 - do and I wouldn't get to do it if I was
30:39 - doing something that I didn't like to do
30:40 - for eight hours a day
30:44 - okay
30:45 - [Music]
30:52 - um okay so now I'm going to start I'm
30:55 - going to look through some questions
30:58 - Cody uh for the course price you will
31:01 - find out the C uh so there is a free
31:04 - course right uh that's there's one free
31:06 - course or a few free courses I have on
31:09 - my website uh if you go to if you go to
31:12 - my website clever program.com hit enter
31:14 - site and then if you hit Academy it'll
31:16 - take you to the clever programmer
31:19 - Academy and that's where I have all the
31:21 - free courses so um you know whatever you

31:34 - that's going to be a paid course and for
31:36 - the students who joined the wait list
31:38 - not only am I going to give you my top
31:40 - free python coding
31:42 - resources but I'm also going to you're
31:45 - going to get early bird discount okay so
31:48 - that's why I want you to if you're
31:51 - interested much better to join and I
31:54 - want to reward the people who join fast
31:56 - and take action fast
32:01 - yes I love this question what is a good
32:03 - laptop for programming MacBook Pro 2015
32:06 - literally nothing better boom done um
32:11 - God I just hate Windows I'm so sorry I
32:14 - just hate windows and I know most people
32:15 - are on
32:16 - Windows um and before everybody starts
32:19 - yelling at me and going crazy it's not
32:21 - that bad it's just you know it's just a
32:23 - personal preference you can still
32:25 - program and you can still be a developer
32:27 - in no way it should stop you from
32:29 - becoming a developer it's just that
32:30 - MacBook makes your life a lot
32:32 - easier uh I've worked with uh uh Ubuntu
32:37 - MacBook and then or sorry Linux you know
32:40 - which is mac and then Windows OS and the
32:43 - easiest and the best one I found after
32:46 - you know 20 hour days of programming
32:48 - every single day for years was the
32:51 - MacBook one obuntu is pretty good too
32:54 - but I think Mac wins cuz it's os's
32:56 - better than obuntu
33:01 - KSP heard that and she's she's uh
33:03 - getting pretty pissed off cuz I said uh
33:06 - talk about
33:09 - um Windows it is what it is you know I'm
33:14 - just a hater what can I do like my
33:16 - brother he wanted to show me the power
33:18 - of windows so he he you know uh he
33:22 - whatever he gets excited about he starts
33:23 - going crazy about it you know this just
33:25 - becomes his life so he brought in
33:27 - windows and he's like you know now you
33:30 - can you can put on Crazy Games well
33:32 - which is true you know you can't you
33:34 - can't game really well on Mac so he
33:36 - wanted to show me all these amazing
33:38 - games on
33:40 - Windows and when I was when I was going
33:42 - through those games it was really fun to
33:44 - play them and and the graphics were
33:47 - crazy but when I try to like do command
33:49 - line stuff I'm still like it's just it's
33:52 - just not programming friendly you know
33:56 - and then there's just some quirky stuff
33:58 - that happens in Windows that I'm not a
33:59 - huge fan of I just find MacBooks really
34:01 - smooth plus the MacBook laptops Mouse
34:05 - like holy crap I've never felt a better
34:08 - trackpad like somebody telling me of a
34:10 - better trackpad than macbook's trackpad
34:14 - there isn't
34:16 - one but you know obviously with Windows
34:19 - you can just get a mouse like a razor
34:20 - mouse or something and then you're
34:24 - set um my free course should be opening
34:28 - I don't know what you mean caric by your
34:30 - free course is not opening send me a
34:31 - link or a screenshot of your problem and
34:33 - I'll look into
34:35 - it uh all right Larry says I will get
34:38 - one tomorrow you know guys I I sometimes
34:41 - feel bad when I say stuff like this
34:42 - because you know some of you guys get
34:43 - pumped and then you drop, 1500 bucks if
34:46 - you have spare money yes drop it but if
34:49 - you don't and you're struggling and it's
34:51 - tight um still drop it woo cuz MacBook
34:56 - is just so good but no in seriousness if
34:58 - you're if if it's uh if it's tough you
35:02 - know don't save that money and then you
35:04 - know just
35:05 - um just save that money you know I don't
35:08 - know like save it you know for for the
35:11 - bills and everything else don't you
35:14 - don't want to be in a situation where
35:15 - you're star starving yourself though
35:18 - that's exactly what I did because um I
35:21 - wanted this channel to kick ass and be
35:23 - the best programming channel in the
35:25 - world right clever programmer so what I
35:27 - did was I was like if I let myself be
35:31 - comfortable um I'm not going to spend
35:33 - much time into
35:35 - it so then what I did is um uh to make
35:40 - myself uncomfortable so then I have to
35:42 - survive off of clever programmer and
35:45 - just like give you guys my best what I
35:48 - did is I just cut off all my sources of
35:51 - income so like all the different things
35:53 - I was doing for sources of income I just
35:55 - cut it all out like started with my
35:57 - clients just like cut them all out all
35:59 - the sessions that I had with them just
36:02 - completely brought it down to zero um
36:05 - any part-time work that I was doing I
36:07 - kind of cut that off too and uh and then
36:12 - I also increased my
36:14 - expenses and that basically forced me
36:17 - you know Not only was I already
36:19 - motivated but then that just kind of you
36:22 - know pushed it over the top and that's
36:24 - how I was able to spend you know5 to 20
36:28 - hour workday is just building this
36:29 - channel up you know like 80 100 hours a
36:32 - week and so sometimes people see it and
36:34 - they go oh overnight success or
36:36 - overnight you know you got 50,000
36:38 - subscribers and I'm like
36:40 - H you know that amount of work would
36:43 - take you 10 years to do I just did it in
36:45 - one year or
36:47 - less um and and it's not cuz I'm being
36:50 - you know I'm not trying to be cocky just
36:52 - that I I had no life I still have very
36:54 - little life I'm trying to get some life
36:56 - you know that's what I'm doing
36:58 - now um but yeah that's that's literally
37:01 - what I did so not suggesting that but
37:04 - you know sometimes you just need to kick
37:05 - your ass and grind you know playing safe
37:08 - is uh just sucks like you just live like
37:11 - a sloth you know and I don't want to
37:14 - live like a
37:19 - sloth um
37:32 - nice bracket I'm excited for you he says
37:35 - he's going to get a Macbook uh next
37:36 - weekend super
37:42 - exciting I'm not a huge fan of the
37:44 - newest MacBook the 2016 not a fan I hate
37:48 - its keyboard it's
37:50 - keyboard it's keyboard I don't know what
37:52 - it feels like it it it feels like um
37:59 - it's like these weird sounds these weak
38:02 - like sounds that it makes when you when
38:04 - you press the keys and the feeling you
38:08 - just feel so weak using that keyboard I
38:10 - absolutely hate uh the feeling of it
38:14 - 2015 MacBook like my fingers Blaze
38:17 - through that thing I think it might
38:19 - might be one of the best keyboards ever
38:22 - I've ever used I mean and I'm talking
38:24 - you know I have really expensive
38:26 - mechanical keyboards that I use but that
38:29 - macbook's keyboard 2015 is so good so
38:32 - instead of getting the 2016 one I got
38:34 - the 2015
38:37 - one
38:42 - um yeah buddy Gucci glasses you know
38:45 - that's how I do I've had these glasses
38:48 - for a while and surprisingly I never
38:49 - lost them or broke them usually that
38:52 - happens more often than you think but uh
38:54 - not with these the weirdest thing is
38:57 - when and I'm trying to find my
39:00 - glasses and people never understand why
39:02 - it takes me a while to find my glasses
39:04 - and it's like guys without glasses I
39:08 - can't really find my glasses you know so
39:12 - it's kind of a sad thing and my oldest
39:14 - brother just got lace lasic eye surgery
39:17 - and uh it sucked for him for a while but
39:19 - now
39:20 - he's Gucci just like just like my
39:25 - glasses I do follow James alterer great
39:30 - uh dude and I follow him on medium and I
39:32 - try to follow him on other places but
39:34 - the people I follow more are Gary ve
39:37 - ramit Sati Grant
39:41 - Cardone Tim Ferris and I started
39:44 - following him reading his book 4our work
39:46 - week you know uh and yeah that leads me
39:49 - to another thing
39:51 - like here's what I get to do this is
39:53 - what software development job you know
39:56 - being a software consultant
39:57 - this is the amazing thing so I'm back to
40:00 - you know doing some contract work and
40:01 - all that for my clients basically I can
40:03 - choose to fire them or hire them um when
40:06 - I want uh so basically if I want to
40:09 - increase my workload or decrease it I if
40:11 - I need extra cash flow but what's cool
40:14 - is um I'm spending most of my days now
40:17 - because I'm I'm really excited about
40:18 - learning um you know I've been doing
40:20 - powerlifting for a while but I want to
40:22 - transition that into something um you
40:25 - know give it a purpose so I started
40:28 - learning fighting basically
40:30 - jiujitsu um it's more mostly
40:34 - self-defense and um you know I've been
40:36 - rolling with my with my friends and kind
40:39 - of picking it up and I've also started
40:41 - doing muai and boxing and what's funny
40:44 - is I was never ever able to do those
40:47 - things with my previous jobs that I was
40:49 - doing and now it's so funny because most
40:53 - of my time is spent there and people are
40:54 - always asking me they're like you know
40:56 - my friends they're like um how are you
40:59 - able to survive you know month after
41:01 - month you know even financially cuz
41:03 - you're not doing it seems like you're
41:05 - not doing anything and you're just kind
41:06 - of enjoying yourself hanging out with
41:08 - your family and then you know going and
41:10 - learning martial arts which is super
41:13 - random and uh that's the beauty of it
41:16 - that's what I get to do I get to live uh
41:19 - a very like free like a freeing
41:22 - lifestyle and that's what I really
41:24 - really love because most of the times
41:28 - you work for time or money right you try
41:31 - to make more money so you can have more
41:33 - time or you try to spend more time so
41:36 - you can have more money so then you can
41:37 - have more time but money is a re
41:40 - renewable resource like Tim Ferris says
41:43 - you can get more money um but time you
41:46 - can't get more time so you miss your
41:48 - nephew's second birthday you're an
41:50 -  and that's what you are for the
41:52 - rest of your life
41:54 - um you know just just an example
41:57 - so or or you miss your you know
42:00 - significant others like something
42:01 - special or you know you had a kid and
42:05 - you you missed the first time he walked
42:07 - because you were at work like do you
42:08 - know it's just what time you can't get
42:11 - it back so if if if you have to build
42:14 - systems and do things that help you get
42:16 - that time that's that's way more
42:21 - important uh
42:23 - beu there's a lot of uh free stuff I
42:27 - have on YouTube that's really good for
42:31 - for programming videos like even my code
42:33 - academy series I think it's very
42:34 - instructional so I would look into that
42:36 - because his question is what do I do now
42:38 - I'm done with your free course and all
42:41 - of that so what do I do at this point
42:43 - because your paid course is not out yet
42:45 - my created apps with python course um
42:49 - and what I would say is join the wait
42:52 - list for my create apps with python
42:54 - course that teaches you how to build
42:55 - your portfolio and land your first
42:57 - client and in the
42:59 - meantime uh follow my stuff that's on
43:01 - YouTube I have 160 videos I mean even
43:04 - the soft skill stuff is pretty useful
43:06 - but if you're not interested in that
43:08 - tons of hard technical skills I teach
43:10 - you there's even a few videos on SQL
43:13 - that I have and if you're sick of me you
43:15 - can watch somebody else's YouTube
43:16 - tutorials so those are the things that
43:19 - you can be and should be doing in the
43:21 - meantime
43:30 - Caleb good job completing that without
43:33 - looking at the solution great great
43:35 - great job that is super
43:41 - amazing June 26th to 29th is when it
43:45 - opens up so that's the time frame I
43:47 - would be looking at um all right guys so
43:49 - I'm going to get going now I wanted to
43:53 - just come on for a little bit and like
43:55 - debunk a few minutes and and talk to you
43:58 - about the job opportunity that exists
44:00 - for software developers and talk to you
44:01 - about that it's easier than you think to
44:04 - get started honestly for you if you are
44:07 - right now in it or a techsavvy person or
44:11 - somebody who's interested in switching
44:13 - over and you're currently doing a job
44:15 - and you are looking to transition to the
44:17 - field of
44:18 - programming it it shouldn't it doesn't
44:22 - take more than two to three months if
44:24 - you focus on learning the right skills
44:27 - it does not I repeat does not take more
44:29 - than 2 to 3 months to start getting paid
44:32 - okay that's what my course is mainly
44:35 - about and I want to show you that so um
44:39 - just please understand that because a
44:40 - lot of people have all these crazy myths
44:42 - about you have to do this for like 30
44:45 - years how can you call yourself a blah
44:47 - blah blah blah
44:49 - blah you don't have to do anything for
44:52 - 30 years before you start getting paid
44:54 - for it okay
44:57 - um like one of my videos I have where
44:59 - I'm I talk about and I don't even say
45:01 - how I became a software developer in 3
45:03 - months I said how I learned to code in
45:06 - less than three months and I have these
45:08 - comments of people are just like how how
45:12 - is it possible that you could do that
45:14 - how how did you become a and then
45:15 - they're like nobody can become a
45:17 - professional software developer in less
45:20 - than 10 years let alone 3 months and
45:23 - then I'm I'm looking at it and I think
45:26 - first of all I never said software
45:28 - developer second of all I never said a
45:31 - professional software
45:33 - developer right um and and I got to
45:37 - thinking that it's the
45:39 - projection a lot of the times when
45:41 - people kind of uh have like a little bit
45:44 - of outrage against you it's it's a
45:46 - projection of themselves so it's
45:48 - basically that person thinking holy crap
45:51 - I could never do that how would that
45:53 - even be possible so then they let that
45:54 - out and say how could you do that what
45:57 - makes you think you could do that and
46:00 - um and that's what it is so we have to
46:02 - challenge the status quos um and it
46:05 - doesn't take that long you know if you
46:08 - do the right things it doesn't take
46:10 - anybody that long okay like one of the
46:12 - people got a job at Tesla from a
46:14 - Craigslist post like think about that he
46:18 - has a post about it on
46:21 - medium.com all right in the meantime
46:23 - link is in the description click that
46:26 - freak freaking buttton smash that link
46:29 - and sign up okay right now and once you
46:33 - sign up I want you to say that you
46:35 - signed up so then I
46:41 - know Ajax good job you know if you can't
46:44 - find
46:46 - friends that push you and uh help you
46:50 - achieve your goals or you know push in
46:53 - the right direction surround yourself by
46:56 - by these amazing people that happen to
46:59 - be online right Grant Cardone Gary veay
47:01 - RIT Sati for me Mariah cause you guys
47:04 - will never have to care about morac CA
47:06 - she's specific to marketing
47:08 - world but um you
47:11 - know just look up people who you you are
47:15 - you know who who are your role models
47:17 - and really listen to them watch their
47:19 - videos subscribe to their channels and
47:22 - your life will be getting morphed
47:24 - without you even knowing it okay John
47:27 - sones great example simple
47:29 - programmer so kind of surround yourself
47:32 - in that world and then those are the
47:35 - five friends that you have you know that
47:37 - end up shaping your life rather than
47:39 - maybe some of the influence that you're
47:40 - are around now that may be negative kind
47:43 - of sucks you right takes out that
47:45 - positive energy from you um and maybe
47:47 - isn't putting you in the direction that
47:49 - you want to be going
47:54 - in okay
47:58 - yeah so blazen if you if you put your
48:03 - email in that's it uh you're signed up
48:06 - for the wait list not the course the
48:09 - wait list so that means that when it
48:12 - launches in 4 days June 26th you'll be
48:15 - the first one to know also I'm going to
48:19 - have a webinar on June 25th a day before
48:22 - the launch so whoever comes to that
48:25 - webinar gets a huge early bird discount
48:29 - so if you're looking to join this course
48:32 - and get on this and start learning
48:34 - programming software development learn
48:36 - how to beef up that portfolio and you
48:38 - want to learn you know how to get your
48:41 - clients because most courses only take
48:43 - money from you right they don't teach
48:45 - you how to use programming to make money
48:47 - my course puts money back in your pocket
48:49 - one of my main goals is to get you that
48:52 - return on that investment but more
48:53 - importantly start helping you build up
48:55 - that real life portfol folio so you can
48:57 - apply to other jobs and start getting
49:00 - paid for what you love you know and do
49:02 - meaningful work at the same time so
49:05 - again when you join it and you get on
49:08 - that webinar you're going to have a
49:10 - early bird discount and I'm I send you a
49:13 - gift if you get on my weight list
49:21 - now um Raa says um I'm not going to say
49:25 - the whole thing but basically Al Raa
49:28 - hates me because I do paid courses and
49:33 - don't give poor people a chance to
49:36 - learn um okay so I have 160 videos that
49:40 - are free and I have three free
49:44 - courses but more importantly you know
49:46 - the reason why the course is paid is
49:48 - because when I when the company gets
49:51 - paid and I get paid I reinvest to buy
49:55 - things like these
49:57 - to buy these amazing lighting
50:00 - kits right and to then increase the
50:04 - production quality of my video equipment
50:07 - and the course quality and all of that
50:09 - right so um a lot of people um think
50:13 - that the world is a zero sum game
50:16 - meaning that if you benefit I lose or if
50:19 - I benefit you
50:21 - lose but that's not necessarily true
50:24 - right it's possible for you to benefit
50:27 - at the same time for me to benefit as
50:29 - well okay so um you know I and I'm not
50:36 - hateful of what Raa said you know he or
50:40 - she said because I used to kind of think
50:44 - like that too and I would get really
50:46 - angry when people ever charge for things
50:48 - and I was like you're a scammer you're
50:50 - charging for things but then That's How
50:52 - businesses work when you pay Microsoft
50:55 - to buy that laptop or or you pay Apple
50:58 - they improve their company and then next
51:00 - time you get iPhone 7 instead of a
51:01 - iPhone 6 you know it improves and
51:04 - apparently they take away the freaking
51:06 - wires so you can't put in uh your
51:08 - headsets you need a dongle that's why I
51:10 - decided to stick with iPhone 6 and not
51:13 - upgrade even my even though my plan was
51:16 - eligible all
51:19 - right all right
51:21 - beautiful how she signed up great uh
51:26 - Blazin signed up that's
51:29 - great uh beu I think signed up beautiful
51:33 - bracket signed up
51:35 - great all right this is amazing
51:38 - guys Robert Newman signed up
51:43 - beautiful um all right I'm I really got
51:46 - to get going running a little bit would
51:48 - you still rate IMAX for coding not just
51:50 - Mac laptops if you don't want to travel
51:53 - a lot then IMAX but generally when I'm
51:55 - coding I go to like different Starbucks
51:59 - or I'll go to like different um you know
52:02 - hole inth wall type of places or cafes
52:04 - or wherever and I can just bring my
52:07 - laptop with me sometimes the weather is
52:09 - really nice so I'll sit back in my
52:10 - backyard you know kick up my feet and
52:12 - then code while like enjoying the view
52:15 - you know slurping on my
52:17 - smoothie you know um you it's hard to do
52:21 - that with the iMac but I love iMac and
52:24 - I've never had anything better than
52:25 - imac's performance performance so I have
52:28 - right now I'm on my iMac and whenever I
52:30 - come to my office it's unbelievable so
52:33 - if you can afford having uh only one of
52:35 - those things I would suggest maybe a
52:37 - Macbook for the flexibility but if you
52:42 - um if you have extra money then get both
53:00 - uh Sam asks any updates if I've signed
53:02 - up for the oop course previously so Sam
53:06 - I think had has already joined the op
53:08 - course the last time it opened and yes
53:10 - there are updates meaning that we're
53:13 - adding new content to the course so even
53:14 - for the people who had joined previously
53:17 - there's going to be newer material for
53:19 - you to watch and as new material gets
53:22 - added it's free for you for the rest of
53:24 - your life so um there that's one big
53:28 - thing um that we're going to be doing
53:30 - most of the new material is recorded and
53:34 - it's already pretty much edited but uh
53:36 - we're going to add it in as one Bunch so
53:39 - while everybody's joining that material
53:42 - is going to get added to the course it's
53:43 - going to become even bigger so yeah
53:46 - you're there's going to be new material
53:48 - coming to that
53:50 - course including you know the new stuff
53:52 - that's getting added now that we have
53:54 - just shot it it's um it's where I show
53:58 - you where do you actually go to get your
54:00 - first clients um in less than 30 days of
54:05 - starting to Learn Python and how you
54:09 - know um how do you actually deal with
54:12 - those clients meaning from start to
54:13 - finish like how do you actually approach
54:15 - those clients stand out from the crowd
54:18 - um how do you actually then end up
54:20 - Landing them and then having a
54:22 - consistent relationship and then what do
54:24 - you do if sometimes you can't help them
54:26 - and you find yourself kind of screwed
54:29 - where do you turn for help and what
54:32 - action should you take so if you accept
54:35 - a client and then you find out you're
54:37 - not ready to do that job well that's
54:40 - pretty first of all embarrassing and
54:42 - second of all it'll hurt your reputation
54:44 - so what are the exact things to say to
54:47 - them um to deal with that the right way
54:50 - and then how to go about you know and
54:52 - then help them because I ended up
54:55 - figuring out ways and it took me a while
54:58 - to be able to help people who I couldn't
55:01 - help in the first place so those are
55:03 - some of the things that I'll be teaching
55:05 - you as well you know and those things
55:06 - you know take some time but those are
55:08 - the new material that's going to be
55:10 - added to the
55:16 - course um why don't I do Swift uh I
55:19 - don't want to just do too many different
55:22 - things at once I want to uh take people
55:25 - on a specific spefic path so right now
55:28 - the path is Python Programming uh web
55:32 - development so I want to teach you guys
55:34 - how to do web development and I also
55:36 - want to start getting you guys real work
55:39 - and clients as fast as possible so
55:42 - that's really my goal so I'm not going
55:43 - to be branching out into Swift now
55:47 - because it just uh distracts more than
55:49 - it
55:50 - helps and languages are not hard to
55:53 - learn once you learn one you understand
55:55 - the concept and then you can apply to
55:56 - another one and pick up like for example
55:58 - if I were to learn Swift right now it'll
56:00 - take me one weekend and then I'll be
56:03 - okay in Swift like I'll start making you
56:04 - know basic apps on um iPhone or Android
56:09 - and then to become professional it takes
56:10 - a while but now if you know no
56:12 - programming and you try to learn Swift
56:14 - it's going to take you a
56:17 - while okay guys um last questions I'll
56:21 - take before I leave
56:27 - um Damian yes I'm still teaching python
56:31 - the whole course is called
56:34 - python yes I M Matas yes um the this
56:39 - course is going to start talking a
56:41 - little bit about web development so even
56:44 - the course you're currently in right now
56:46 - I know who you are I remember you it's
56:48 - going to talk about web development and
56:50 - then my later courses are going to be
56:52 - very specific to web development so you
56:54 - know flask and Jango and those things so
56:59 - yeah we're going to be talking about
57:02 - that all right
57:12 - um I am just reading questions you
57:20 - guys thank you guys for signing up you
57:23 - know again the link is in the
57:24 - description you sign up and that's also
57:26 - puts you on the webinar and then I'll
57:29 - see you guys on the webinar as well uh
57:32 - that's where I'll I you know I'll share
57:34 - my story with you guys um kind of what
57:38 - it took for me to find this beautiful
57:41 - world uh and then I'll talk more
57:43 - specifically about you know Landing your
57:46 - first client and things like that and
57:48 - the webinar and all that stuff is
57:50 - obviously
57:54 - free okay
57:57 - have you heard of KV yes I have um I
58:01 - signed up what book should I read so I
58:03 - can improve my programming
58:05 - skills uh Jud asks great question you
58:08 - can read this
58:12 - one I'm actually thinking of writing my
58:15 - own book
58:17 - um but you know that I'm I'm better on
58:20 - video than I'm on typing words but you
58:24 - know so one day I might write my own but
58:26 - until that day this is a great book to
58:28 - start off with I you know I started off
58:31 - with this book great freaking book it's
58:33 - called Uh Python Programming and
58:36 - introduction to computer science by and
58:38 - it's the second edition by John
58:42 - zel and uh yeah just very he keeps it
58:46 - very simple and gets you to do some
58:49 - really cool stuff so you'll learn a lot
58:53 - about programming what you don't learn
58:56 - which is what you know again the reason
58:58 - behind the start of clever programmer
59:00 - was how to take programming and then
59:03 - actually use it to start working in the
59:06 - real world and you know work
59:09 - professionally and do that fast not like
59:13 - um yeah just spend eight years learning
59:16 - software development and then um you
59:19 - know apply to an internship for like
59:21 - four years where you'll work for free
59:23 - and like apply to 100 jobs you know on
59:26 - monster.com and indeed.com and you know
59:29 - just uh put it on LinkedIn and cross
59:31 - your fingers and pray to God that
59:33 - somebody puts you in their company and
59:36 - then you know just whoever chooses you
59:38 - just join them because you know you
59:39 - don't have a
59:41 - choice that's you know uh a lot of what
59:44 - happens to most people and so that's the
59:47 - reason behind what I do but again great
59:51 - book use that book okay literally um
59:55 - probably proba one minute left
59:59 - guys uh what small projects great
60:01 - question exactly what's covered in the
60:03 - course we go over examples of different
60:06 - projects but if I had to give you some
60:08 - now um make a thing that can read the
60:11 - word frequency so how many times
60:13 - somebody said the how many times
60:15 - somebody said what how many times
60:16 - somebody said how you know from any
60:19 - given document you know that's something
60:21 - maybe you can't do right now because
60:23 - most of you guys are beginners maybe
60:26 - you're an IT field maybe you are um you
60:30 - know uh looking to go into software
60:33 - development you currently have a job
60:35 - right now so something maybe you can't
60:39 - maybe not as small for you but it's
60:42 - something to look into again my free
60:44 - course online called Learn Python Learn
60:48 - Python that teaches you you know through
60:51 - projects so you're doing projects the
60:53 - entire time and that's how you learn
60:56 - um for those generally I don't answer
60:59 - questions with three question marks and
61:02 - or more because
61:04 - um you know it's like sign of a crazy
61:08 - person um it seems like you're very
61:11 - frazzled and frantic and not thinking
61:15 - calmly and also I don't answer when
61:17 - people like copy paste questions because
61:20 - it just developed bad
61:21 - habits you know it rewards bad bad
61:24 - habits but you know um I will answer
61:27 - your question right now yes it's not
61:30 - worth learning cotlin over python over
61:33 - JavaScript like there's no one language
61:37 - that is the best okay I tell you guys
61:39 - python is great and especially if you're
61:42 - starting out is great but you know
61:45 - different languages
61:46 - have different benefits and time to
61:49 - learn the reason why I say python is the
61:51 - best because of how simple it is to pick
61:53 - up and how it's grow and how it's so
61:57 - powerful then later if you want you can
61:59 - pick up other languages as well along
62:01 - the way let's say you're you are
62:03 - becoming a web developer with python
62:06 - sure you can start picking up JavaScript
62:08 - along the way and become even
62:11 - better um if you're doing Python and all
62:14 - of a sudden you want to become a data
62:15 - scientist well no need to switch over to
62:17 - anything because python you can also do
62:19 - data science with it so it's a
62:20 - multi-purpose language and that's why I
62:24 - choose this over other
62:29 - um no worries for
62:39 - those Max you are more awesome and I
62:43 - love you even more uh and thank you for
62:46 - saying that it really makes me really
62:48 - happy thank you
62:50 - seriously
62:52 - um great videographer Alexander nice man
62:56 - my brother is a videographer now he's a
62:58 - colorist he did some stuff and now some
63:01 - of his stuff is on Netflix too he's uh
63:03 - he's kind of killing it but yeah he
63:05 - moved out to uh he has a pretty like you
63:08 - know those cliche stories he couldn't
63:11 - find a lot of work in Chicago he was
63:12 - hustling he was getting underpaid
63:14 - overworked all of that great amazing
63:16 - stuff then he moved to California
63:19 - sacrificed everything you know gave up
63:21 - his family lived out there alone and
63:23 - then you know he hustled and he found
63:25 - great work and now he's doing pretty
63:27 - good but uh it's a great field I love it
63:30 - I have a lot of respect for it and what
63:32 - he taught me in one day is all all the
63:34 - stuff I still use to make my videos
63:36 - today so the whole Channel you know I
63:39 - learned you know the basic stuff on
63:41 - Final Cut Pro and then I used it to make
63:43 - all the videos that I did um that's
63:47 - amazing and even in even in you know
63:51 - you're maybe you're just doing camera
63:52 - work but I have a feeling maybe you do
63:54 - some video editing as well and even in
63:56 - freaking editing there's there you can
63:58 - use programming so you can use Python
64:00 - for example if you have a very
64:02 - systematic thing where every 5 seconds
64:04 - into the video your intro shows up and
64:06 - every like last 10 seconds your outro
64:08 - shows up and in the middle like
64:10 - something happens it fits like that you
64:12 - can create like a simple program in
64:14 - Python uh that can automatically do that
64:18 - to all the videos so you actually don't
64:20 - have to spend time editing them so if it
64:22 - took you 10 20 30 hours per week editing
64:25 - video videos for your clients well not
64:27 - anymore because you get these videos
64:29 - from clients you hit one button done you
64:31 - just send it back to them you collect
64:32 - your paycheck and you spend time with
64:34 - your family and your clients were happy
64:36 - Boom everybody wins so uh programming is
64:39 - really kind of
64:41 - everywhere more so than you would
64:45 - think all right guys um last time I'm
64:48 - going to give a call out to that link
64:51 - below you know make sure to sign up
64:54 - click that link below
64:57 - that way you get on the wait list you
65:00 - get my top free coding
65:02 - resources um you get to come to the
65:04 - webinar in you don't want to miss this
