07:23 - not gonna fall here yes got one for me
07:28 - sweet Oh
07:31 - equipped alright so basically that Tahoe
07:39 - vacation was epic it was a lot of fun
07:41 - and that ice mountain that we were going
07:44 - on it was actually a lot more freaky
07:45 - dangerous than it looked and then you
07:47 - can like fall 500 feet from the edge and
07:50 - the people that just crossed us like
07:52 - there are two women they came back and
07:54 - we asked them if we should go and if
07:56 - we're able to go and be fine and they're
07:57 - like yeah you'll be fine except no you
08:00 - know they proved it to us cuz they had
08:01 - like a little baby in their hands and
08:03 - they just like hiked the whole thing and
08:04 - came back yeah we thought would be fine
08:06 - except when we went we got murdered and
08:08 - we had to actually head back after just
08:10 - like five minutes of hiking it so
08:12 - couldn't do it we have to come back more
08:15 - prepared more skilled and just get
08:17 - better at all this stuff other than that
08:18 - you pretty much saw everything else
08:20 - right the little adventures we had now
08:23 - what I want to leave you with is like
08:25 - look no matter what you're doing in life
08:26 - no matter how busy your life is make
08:29 - time for the people that you care about
08:30 - make time for your friends and family
08:32 - and that's what is so enjoyable about
08:36 - life right especially if you become
08:37 - let's say a program or a freelancer
08:39 - programmer and you are making money
08:42 - you're earning an income you're able to
08:44 - live that comfortable lifestyle what can
08:47 - you do with your time this is an example
08:49 - there's me showing you what you can do
08:51 - at that time right now I'm focusing on
08:53 - building a business it's hard to find
08:55 - time at the time that I do find I make
08:57 - sure I try to travel I hang out with
08:59 - friends live life to the fullest because
09:01 - if you don't experience this whole
09:03 - spectrum is gonna get boring really
