00:00 - hae-joo what is up how's it going this
00:02 - is Kazi from clever programmer not calm
00:04 - also known as Papa Python in this video
00:06 - we're gonna be talking about why
00:08 - pressure is privileged this is a very
00:11 - important epiphany that we had I had and
00:15 - my friend had what's dev we are in Miami
00:18 - Florida right now actually and this
00:21 - happened at 10x Rose con conference with
00:24 - Grant Cardone and it was beautiful with
00:26 - Jessie it's lection he said and he says
00:28 - that pressure is actually privileged so
00:31 - what the hell does this mean have you
00:33 - ever wanted to achieve the things that
00:35 - you only can dream of if you ever want
00:37 - it to be like hey I want to go to code
00:39 - for X amount of hours and be consistent
00:42 - with it but I keep falling out of it
00:43 - have you ever been in a position where
00:45 - you go okay I want to get a job but I'm
00:47 - gonna like dilly-dally and drag on a
00:49 - little bit but basically the idea is
00:51 - that you know the potential that you
00:53 - have you know what you could be doing
00:54 - what you should be doing which you will
00:56 - be doing you know what your potential
00:57 - could be but you don't actually tap into
01:00 - it and we fall really short of it right
01:02 - so if your potential is up here
01:03 - you're falling a lot short shorter of it
01:05 - so why does that happen often times that
01:08 - happens because you don't allow enough
01:11 - pressure to actually be applied on you
01:13 - right pressure is privilege so what does
01:16 - that actually look like most of our
01:18 - lives we try to do everything that's
01:19 - comfortable so we stay in the same
01:21 - location we stay around the same people
01:23 - we are around the people who make us
01:25 - feel comfortable with what we do it we
01:28 - are recently in my life you know what
01:30 - has been happening is I was around
01:32 - people who weren't doing a lot of things
01:34 - so they were just like relaxing spending
01:36 - a lot of time just hanging out which is
01:38 - cool and awesome and I'm all for that
01:40 - but they weren't living every moment and
01:42 - a
01:43 - so for example that means out if you
01:45 - know what happened to runs in families
01:47 - [Music]
01:50 - why not make that time a hundred percent
01:52 - when they're with their loved ones
01:54 - they're not on a hundred percent when
01:57 - they are at their work at their job or
01:59 - trying to work on their dreams they're
02:00 - not at 100 percent ones they're hitting
02:01 - the gym they're not at a hundred percent
02:03 - it's like all these moments of their
02:05 - lives are not at a hundred percent why
02:07 - is that happening
02:08 - well that's happening because they
02:09 - aren't having enough pressure that is
02:12 - applied to them for example when I was
02:15 - around them I didn't have any pressure
02:16 - applied on me so what was I doing
02:18 - I was dilly-dallying having a good time
02:22 - spending lots of time on social media
02:24 - consuming content and material but not
02:26 - actually outputting not producing not
02:29 - putting stuff out there that's actually
02:30 - helpful for you for anybody else right
02:33 - for the programming Ross or clever
02:35 - programmer I got more and more
02:37 - complacent I got more and more
02:38 - comfortable I had friends who also were
02:40 - okay with just not going to the gym so
02:42 - what happened I kind of stopped moving
02:44 - to the gym I'm like you know what this
02:46 - is all good everything is good life is
02:48 - good and then there came a point
02:49 - especially starting in 2019 I was like
02:51 - okay I need to change this
02:53 - because if I keep living like this I'm
02:54 - just gonna be a loser all right
02:56 - and I don't want to be a loser I don't
02:58 - know about you but I sure don't want to
03:00 - be a loser my definition of a loser
03:02 - somebody who doesn't try and commit 100%
03:04 - and
03:05 - they persisted but what they actually
03:08 - want to be able to do in their life
03:10 - right staying congruent with who you are
03:12 - I in 2019 and as 2018 was coming closer
03:16 - I wanted to hang out with people and
03:17 - spend a lot of time with people who
03:19 - apply pressure to me so for example I
03:21 - have my friend Brandon who will apply
03:24 - pressure to me in business because he's
03:25 - a monster when it comes to business he's
03:27 - killing he's crazy doing millions of
03:29 - dollars at product launches and whatnot
03:31 - and when I'm around him he's just like
03:33 - you're not making content you're not
03:35 - doing this you're not running ads you're
03:37 - not showing up for the people like what
03:39 - the hell are you doing and he'll just
03:41 - need to look at me that way so I feel so
03:43 - much pressure that I keep thinking about
03:46 - it and it's almost like there's
03:47 - biological pressure and so that makes me
03:50 - go back into and hit it harder it's like
03:52 - I have to elevate my normals right I
03:54 - gotta elevate my normals and go to that
03:56 - next level where before my normal was
03:59 - one video a month Mannion that's pretty
04:01 - good but now I'm like that let's do
04:03 - one video a day how about that all right
04:06 - then I have this friend she's amazing
04:09 - her name is Amber Lee and she's in spots
04:11 - she inspires me so much because she's a
04:13 - badass as what she does she's like
04:15 - running his freaking marathon she's
04:17 - killing it she's passionate she's
04:19 - energetic she has ambition and goals and
04:21 - then I go Kay another person around me
04:24 - was so driven with their mission right
04:26 - Brandon is serving with her mission my
04:27 - friend you know Tenzin you guys might
04:30 - not but that was actually recording this
04:31 - video she's so driven in his mission so
04:34 - Brandon Tenzin is like focus on making
04:36 - content focused on pushing myself harder
04:38 - focus on creating more products for
04:40 - students a clever programmer that they
04:42 - will find valuable do coding challenges
04:44 - do coding courses like go all-in
04:46 - and stop just passing it and like oh I'm
04:50 - gonna do like a little bit of content
04:51 - you know this week and then I'm gonna
04:53 - like do a little bit of coding but you
04:55 - know let's not do like so much it's not
04:57 - over do it that'll be too much at this
04:59 - point to be honest like I'm not even
05:00 - doing this for you I'm doing this for
05:02 - myself so I could show they'll up
05:04 - all the time write a lot about a lot of
05:07 - the beautiful thing about your goals is
05:09 - who you
05:10 - end up becoming by doing them not what
05:13 - you get out of it I'm gonna repeat that
05:14 - one more time the biggest most important
05:16 - thing about your goals and achieving
05:17 - them is not what you get but who you
05:20 - become
05:20 - so my important thing is like I'm gonna
05:22 - show up and be a person who people want
05:25 - to follow be that leader but I have to
05:27 - leave myself first
05:29 - all right and then I hope and it's my
05:31 - privilege and I thank you for being here
05:33 - and actually following along and my
05:35 - dream is that you get a lot of value out
05:36 - of this but if one person gets value out
05:38 - of this my job is done
05:39 - so going back right I have these people
05:42 - who are putting pressure on me you know
05:44 - like I selling about my friend Amber Lee
05:45 - she's like going to the gym every day so
05:47 - in my brain there's pressure on me and
05:50 - I'm like you know what I should be going
05:51 - to the gym every day or I should be
05:52 - going like five to six times a week when
05:54 - I see another one of my friend who's
05:56 - really killing it it's a mother aspect
05:57 - of life work this friend is completely
05:59 - full of life when he's hanging out with
06:01 - family and friends he's like all in and
06:04 - he just loves them makes me go you know
06:06 - what maybe I should be doing that maybe
06:08 - when I spend time with my family and
06:10 - friends instead of just being on my
06:13 - phone or just being around them talking
06:16 - like actually show passion like show
06:19 - physiological passion be there 100%
06:22 - mentally emotionally put my phone on Do
06:24 - Not Disturb or airplane mode be there
06:27 - for them same thing applies when leading
06:29 - my team same thing applies for if I'm
06:31 - sitting down to code and write and make
06:34 - applications I want to just be able to
06:37 - focus go all in but to be honest a lot
06:40 - of what changed for me and everything
06:42 - turned around especially in 2019 not
06:46 - like I wasn't doing I was doing a
06:47 - lot even in 2018 and stuff but you know
06:49 - I'm like a normal human I have my highs
06:51 - and lows and I had a pretty low low low
06:53 - you know try to get a low type of low in
06:57 - 2018 and so now I have to bring it back
07:01 - and come around but I am so on fire and
07:04 - I know I'm gonna keep being on fire but
07:06 - I'm just looking for
07:07 - pressure and just forcing myself into
07:09 - those situations okay other examples are
07:11 - about to get on calls with people I
07:13 - scheduled them in my calendar and I
07:15 - force myself to be able to show up for
07:18 - those calls to code for an hour with a
07:20 - buddy or to talk with a buddy for an
07:22 - hour for a specific agenda or even to
07:25 - just have a normal conversation whatever
07:27 - it may be
07:27 - I'm finding ways to have external facing
07:31 - accountability and a private apply
07:32 - pressure to myself even this is video 15
07:35 - I believe of day 15 of that challenge
07:38 - that I'm doing where I'm doing one video
07:40 - every single day by always saying this
07:42 - is day 15 of the challenge this is day
07:44 - 16 of the challenge there's more
07:46 - pressure being applied to myself because
07:47 - now you are holding me accountable you
07:49 - the person is watching this video and
07:51 - I'm putting it this out there and I'm
07:52 - saying this so now when I go home and
07:54 - I'm feeling like I just want to scratch
07:56 - my ass and go to sleep and not do
07:57 - anything before I'll actually knock out
08:00 - it'll go you know what I need to
08:02 - actually create something like okay like
08:04 - let's go after after I get it done that
08:06 - always feel amazing but at that time
08:08 - maybe I'm thinking man I don't want to
08:10 - do this right now like really knowing
08:11 - I'd rather just go to sleep but I'll do
08:13 - it
08:14 - because now there's actually pressure
08:15 - being applied and this is the good kind
08:17 - of pressure all right this is the
08:19 - healthy kind of pressure
08:20 - it's a pressure that gets you to do what
08:22 - you are in line with your life to do
08:24 - okay this is not the kind of pressure
08:26 - that will burn you out and personally
08:29 - I'd much rather be burnt out than
08:32 - dilly-dallied out you know then lukewarm
08:35 - doubt if that's a tournament giving 10%
08:37 - for 10-15 years uh I'd rather give a
08:41 - hundred percent or half a year or one
08:43 - year and then just completely change it
08:45 - okay so for example if I give this
08:47 - channel a clever program one year and I
08:49 - just go all-in and give it my all done
08:51 - if I want to change directions that do
08:52 - something
08:53 - I'll be so happy else I'll do it but I
08:56 - can't give it my 10% of what my
08:58 - potential actually is and then go oh you
09:00 - know what now I'm gonna change like my
09:01 - business plan and like now let's do
09:03 - something else because you know I feel
09:05 - like everybody else has made all these
09:07 - videos and anybody who could get help
09:09 - it's already gotten help that it's
09:10 - not even about that it's about what have
09:13 - I put into it what kind of effort have I
09:15 - made into it right that's why I had my
09:17 - simple programmer so much on sanyas
09:20 - because this guy has produced for
09:22 - killing 2,000 video zones and if you ask
09:25 - him I promise you while his audience was
09:28 - one of his goals to grow in all that
09:30 - it's who he's becoming by being able to
09:32 - do that right now he's on some crazy
09:35 - shootings like talking to Dan Locke and
09:36 - whatever but that's why this dude has
09:39 - inspired me so much to actually even
09:41 - start my channel in the first place was
09:42 - cuz he doesn't make excuses he just
09:45 - focuses on the process he just keeps
09:46 - doing it and he keeps becoming a
09:48 - different person right he's changing
09:51 - with his goals so this year all my goals
09:55 - are process-oriented focus they're not
09:58 - outcome so for example process oriented
10:01 - meaning instead of saying oh we're gonna
10:03 - I want to hit 1 million subscribers this
10:05 - year that's not my goal I don't care if
10:07 - I hit 10,000 subscribers in this year or
10:09 - I hit a million subscribers this year I
10:11 - mean it before but my main goal is I
10:13 - want to produce minimum 200 videos many
10:17 - a month 200 videos I want to produce I
10:20 - want to go to the gym minimum 200 times
10:23 - that's it
10:24 - does it matter how hard I go alo I go it
10:27 - doesn't matter if my squats at like 400
10:29 - pounds or 500 pounds none of that
10:32 - matters what matters to me is that I
10:34 - show the up and actually get
10:45 - discipline structured manner so for you
10:49 - my friend I hope what you get out of
10:51 - watching this video is like look I'm on
10:52 - day 15 of video 15 challenge this is the
10:55 - same guy who makes one video every
10:57 - frickin like few months in a blue moon
10:59 - okay it's hard to be able to do this you
11:02 - should come up with full energy just
11:04 - give you all I have every single
11:06 - video it's hard it's not easy but I love
11:10 - doing it I know it's the right thing it
11:11 - makes me feel good after I do it so I'm
11:13 - committing to it and I apply all kinds
11:16 - of external pressure forces me into it
11:18 - so for you if you want to be able to
11:20 - pull it every day you want to work on a
11:22 - project every day you want to try to
11:24 - apply to a job every day whatever it is
11:26 - make a goal talk about it to your
11:28 - friends hold yourself accountable but
11:31 - then apply pressure on yourself from
11:33 - external facing accountability get your
11:36 - friends to apply pressure to you if
11:37 - they're not gonna apply pressure to you
11:39 - get yourself some friends who
11:41 - have the balls to apply pressure on you
11:43 - okay don't be with people who don't
11:46 - apply pressure on you they're here to
11:48 - make you feel good but they don't
11:50 - they're not actually there to help you
11:52 - in your life okay so this is something
11:55 - really important be around people who
11:57 - applied that pressure on you please
11:58 - because that pressure is gonna
12:01 - like honestly the best way I can put it
12:04 - is I'm the most on fire I've ever been
12:06 - I'm not missing Jim I'm not missing
12:08 - videos I am actually you know I said day
12:10 - 15 video 15 but in the last 15 days I've
12:13 - probably made 30 videos okay and done a
12:16 - lot more stuff than that but it's but
12:19 - what I want to the main thing I want to
12:20 - tell you is that the pressure that's
12:22 - being applied to me what it makes me
12:24 - feel like is that I don't even feel like
12:26 - I'm actually working mustering up the
12:29 - courage to do stuff it's literally like
12:31 - a biological pressure applied to me that
12:34 - makes me go to the gym make a video so
12:38 - what I'm telling you is that once you
12:40 - apply it in the right way it doesn't
12:41 - even feel like you're actually doing so
12:44 - much of that external conflict fighting
12:46 - your inner demons you just do it it just
12:50 - happened all right it's the same way as
12:52 - life you probably just go to the
12:54 - bathroom every day are you probably to
12:55 - drink water every day or eat every day
12:57 - no matter what you will do those things
12:59 - there's this biological need to do that
13:02 - that's kind of how I feel right now with
13:04 - so much pressure of life to me from so
13:05 - many different directions I just feel
13:08 - the need to be at my hundred percent BMI
13:10 - potential and it's kind of addicting
13:12 - it's kind of excited so my message today
13:14 - for you is that get people around you
13:17 - who applied the pressure on you be in a
13:19 - position you know have yourself goals
13:21 - make yourself accountable be in a
13:23 - position where you are trying to live up
13:25 - to your 100% okay and because I'm doing
13:28 - this challenge as well follow along on
13:30 - this journey with me this is day 15 out
13:32 - of 30 days of videos that I'm doing in a
13:34 - row and instead and you know follow me a
13:36 - clever Kazi on my Instagram because you
13:38 - can follow behind the scenes exactly how
13:40 - I'm doing this thing step-by-step and
13:42 - plus you can actually tag me in your
13:44 - stories you know add clever Kazi and do
13:46 - hashtag 30 days coding challenge 30 days
13:49 - challenge and I'll repost that on my
13:51 - story as well but this way you will feel
13:53 - that you are also accountable for
13:55 - something right so that's another way
13:58 - for you to apply external taste
14:00 - accountability but you can do a coding
14:03 - challenge with me for the next 15 days
14:05 - or next 30 days whatever it is the
14:06 - commit to so
14:07 - okay with that said thank you so much
14:10 - for watching as always I love your face
14:12 - subscribe to the channel if you haven't
14:14 - already like the video really helps and
14:18 - really helps out the channel as always I
14:21 - love your face and I'll see you in the
14:24 - next video have an incredible video that
14:27 - I want you to go and see that I've put
14:29 - together okay this video is unbelievable
14:31 - this video will show you how I went from
14:33 - being a dumb broken Community College
14:35 - student to making hundred and four
14:37 - thousand dollars a year as a developer I
14:39 - forget what it mean for you if you made
14:41 - your first $1,000 from coding what would
14:44 - it mean for you if I reveal to you my
14:46 - step-by-step system that I use to go
14:50 - from being completely broke to then
14:53 - learning how to code in just a few
14:55 - months landing my contract as a
14:57 - freelancer with Python and being able to
15:00 - make twenty thousand dollars while I was
15:03 - a terrible Oakland Community College
15:05 - student and to then being able to live
15:08 - the lifestyle I want on my own terms and
15:10 - have the ability to have my own time
15:12 - freedom money and have the ability to
15:15 - make an impact on the world and at the
15:17 - same time travel with my friends be
15:19 - there for my family you know when we hit
15:21 - 300,000 subscribers go to all these
15:23 - events even now I'm in Miami 10x growth
15:26 - Han with Grant Cardone how does that
15:29 - lifestyle come about as a Python
15:30 - developer I was able to create that
15:33 - lifestyle for myself and in this video I
15:35 - want to show you that how you can do
15:37 - that for yourself to take the students
15:39 - like for example John Navarro who went
15:41 - from working with me from complete zero
15:43 - to becoming a senior data scientist or
15:45 - nazar Molly who landed a hundred and
15:48 - thirty thousand dollar contract and now
15:50 - he has moved to Germany with his family
15:52 - and living an amazing life or a foreign
15:54 - Sheikh who was able to make twenty
15:55 - thousand dollars after she took one of
15:58 - our programs but before we continue I do
16:00 - want to talk about the opportunity that
16:03 - exists in 2019 and moving forward as a
16:06 - Python developer so please go watch this
16:09 - video it's an epic video put together
16:11 - click on the link below
16:14 - in the description and it's gonna take
16:15 - you to it with that said thank you so
