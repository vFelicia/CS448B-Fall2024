00:01 - - How should you invest in yourself
00:04 - when it comes to coding
00:06 - and you developing your coding skills?
00:08 - That is the question I also get very often
00:11 - and I'm gonna answer that for you,
00:13 - so without any further ado,
00:15 - let's jump right into it.
00:18 - (dramatic music)
00:22 - I'm gonna also give you examples
00:24 - of what I've done and
what I've invested in
00:26 - and actually specifically
how I invest in myself now
00:31 - and I want you to take away
00:32 - some really important concepts here
00:34 - and they apply to your whole life,
00:36 - your coding career, your
software development career,
00:40 - your whether it's freelancing
00:42 - or whether you want to be an entrepreneur,
00:44 - run your own business, whatever it may be.
00:47 - You are the biggest asset.
00:51 - You are the asset.
00:55 - Creator, not the creation.
00:58 - What does that mean.
01:00 - If somebody works and builds a business,
01:02 - it's not the business that's
the most important asset,
01:04 - it's you, you are the magician,
01:06 - you created the business out of thin air.
01:10 - When it comes to your career
and your software development
01:12 - and your apps, or whatever it may be,
01:14 - you are the creator, you are the magician,
01:18 - you create something out of thin air
01:20 - because of who you are
and what you've learned.
01:23 - What does that mean?
01:26 - Does that mean that the most investment
01:31 - that you should make is
like on the business itself
01:34 - or on some external equipment?
01:39 - Where should you make your investments?
01:40 - Should it be getting the best computers,
01:42 - the best technology
when it comes to coding?
01:46 - When it comes to the business,
01:47 - should it be getting the
best type of office space?
01:49 - Where should you invest?
01:51 - The best investment you can make
01:54 - is actually by investing in yourself.
01:57 - What do I mean by that?
01:59 - Instead of getting all this equipment
02:01 - and all its other stuff
and paying for that,
02:04 - if you have extra money,
great, go ahead and do that
02:07 - but you should actually invest in yourself
02:09 - when it comes to learning.
02:11 - So, go take an online
course, learn from that.
02:18 - There are plenty of free resources,
02:20 - so use them but if there's a course
02:23 - that you're Udacity and you're on Udemy
02:24 - and you're like man, this
course is really good,
02:26 - it can help me, if it's
like five or 10 bucks,
02:28 - go and take the damn
course so you can learn.
02:31 - Another thing that happens
when you make that investment,
02:33 - for me at least what happens
02:34 - is I feel like it's a
little bit more serious
02:37 - and I gotta finish it
02:38 - otherwise I would have
wasted my money so to speak,
02:40 - so that kind of holds me committed to it.
02:44 - And if you're going to
college or high school
02:46 - or whatever, if you're learning
from an academic course,
02:52 - that's just one resource for
you to use and learn from.
02:56 - So, invest in those.
02:59 - Some other forms of investment
03:02 - that are really important for you
03:03 - is invest in a coach
03:07 - who can help you learn more coding.
03:12 - Let's say that there's
a software developer
03:13 - who'll work with you for
$35 an hour or $50 an hour.
03:17 - While that seems like a lot
03:18 - and you're like hey, for 50 bucks
03:20 - I can get like three books.
03:21 - Yes, but here's something
you're not thinking about.
03:25 - When you're working with these people,
03:27 - you're thinking about
just using them as a tutor
03:29 - for that one hour.
03:30 - The most value you can
get out of it actually
03:34 - is when you're working
with somebody for an hour,
03:37 - don't just work with them
for one coding project
03:40 - or one problem but rather ask them
03:44 - about the career,
03:47 - ask them about what
path should you follow,
03:50 - ask them about what projects
03:51 - and what specific things
you should work on
03:53 - for the next few weeks.
03:56 - So, if you're working with
one person for a month
03:58 - and you're doing four hours with them
04:00 - and let's say that costs
you 200 extra bucks a month,
04:03 - that's gonna be one of
the best investments
04:05 - you can make in yourself when it comes
04:06 - to learning coding skills
04:07 - because you have a real software developer
04:09 - who's gonna tell you what
are the right things to do
04:12 - as you advance in your career
04:13 - or if you're a beginner or a student,
04:15 - they'll give you the path,
04:16 - so let's say that you
meet them every Monday.
04:21 - And let's say the first
Monday that you meet them,
04:23 - they assign you at the end of the call,
04:25 - they assign you, hey, this is one project
04:28 - you should work on,
04:29 - here's some assignments
you should work on,
04:31 - we'll reconvene next Monday
04:34 - and then you meet with them
04:34 - and it won't feel like much in the start
04:37 - but that accountability
will be absolute key
04:41 - when it comes to you just
massively improving your skills
04:46 - and sticking to coding and not quitting
04:48 - and improving at a consistent pace
04:50 - 'cause now it's not just you,
04:52 - it's actually somebody else there as well.
04:54 - So, getting mentorship or coaching,
04:57 - that's one powerful way
04:59 - you can actually leverage investments
05:04 - in yourself and speed
up your coding progress.
05:08 - So, that's one way you
can invest in yourself.
05:11 - Just have a mentor or get coding courses
05:16 - and speed up your progress that way.
05:18 - I'm gonna tell you
exactly kind of how much
05:21 - I was investing in myself
05:22 - as I was learning coding
05:24 - and I'll also share with you
05:25 - how much I invest in myself now
05:28 - so you can get an idea of what's okay
05:31 - and where I'm at and where my head is at
05:33 - and maybe it can inspire you
05:35 - and give you ideas to
invest in different things
05:37 - in your life.
05:38 - So, back when I started coding,
05:42 - what I was doing
05:43 - was a lot of the money that I was making
05:45 - from my other freelancing
jobs or whatever it may be,
05:50 - I would use that money
05:52 - to hire a coach and go and
have weekly calls with them
05:57 - for one hour or two
hours, maybe more hours
06:01 - and just work with them
and develop my skills
06:03 - and since I couldn't afford somebody
06:04 - that was really expensive,
06:06 - one thing I can suggest to you
06:08 - is look online on other platforms
06:11 - like there's a platform like onlinejobs.ph
06:14 - and these are Filipino Rock Stars.
06:17 - That's what their title
is on their website
06:20 - and they'll charge you so little,
06:23 - like it's almost like these people
06:24 - you can pay them $100 for
full-time work per week
06:28 - and it's totally legal
06:29 - and they'll work with you.
06:31 - And it can really be that cheap
06:32 - and so, imagine, you
hire somebody from there
06:34 - who can speak English really well
06:36 - and you can pay them 10 bucks an hour,
06:39 - 15 bucks an hour and learn.
06:40 - You can get creative with this process.
06:44 - But the main idea is that
I would invest in myself
06:47 - by working with these coaches
06:49 - and I would do that,
06:51 - so I had a coach on Codementor,
06:55 - I had a coach actually
in real life as well
06:57 - because people wanna help people
06:59 - who are really hungry,
07:02 - so when I was going to
these coding meetups,
07:06 - I was showing everybody I was
hungry, I wanted to learn,
07:08 - so I naturally actually had some mentors
07:10 - that gravitated towards
helping me in my journey
07:13 - and they would help me without needing
07:16 - to even ask me for money.
07:18 - They would just help me
'cause they were excited
07:20 - 'cause somebody was so hungry to learn.
07:22 - I just put my ego to the side.
07:25 - So, I was investing in getting coaching,
07:28 - I was investing in getting courses,
07:30 - so I bought Udacity's course
07:34 - I think on web development,
07:37 - their backend and front end development.
07:39 - I joined their course on,
07:43 - like the computer science course.
07:45 - When it came to Coursera,
07:47 - I joined their path
07:49 - so I could learn from them.
07:51 - I took their IIP course,
07:54 - Introduction to Practical
Programming in Python.
07:56 - I forget specifically how it's written out
07:58 - but that was one of their courses
08:00 - that I took, their PoC,
Principles of Computing
08:03 - and then many, many, many other courses.
08:05 - So, that was another way
I invested in myself.
08:08 - I would get Codecademy
and work through that.
08:11 - And those are just a few examples
08:13 - and nowadays when it comes
to how I invest myself,
08:19 - I have mentorship, so
recently I joined one
08:23 - of my mentor's programs,
08:25 - her name is Mariah
08:26 - and she's just running this
fantastic business program
08:29 - and for six months it was
about a $20,000 program
08:34 - and essentially it's like four calls
08:36 - with two in-person meetups,
08:38 - four calls per month that you get
08:41 - and group calls and then
two in-person meetups
08:45 - and I think I shared a
vlog on that meetup as well
08:48 - but I'm trying to focus
more on the coding things
08:51 - for this channel 'cause
I feel like you guys
08:52 - want the coding stuff
08:54 - and less of the business stuff,
08:55 - so I hear you and I'm gonna
be more specific on that.
08:59 - But that was one thing I invested in.
09:01 - Other things I invested
in is like meal prep.
09:05 - For every week I have specific meals
09:08 - so I don't have to
actually think about that.
09:10 - Other things I invest in
are online business courses
09:13 - or coding courses or people
09:15 - who can help me just learn
coding at a faster rate
09:18 - 'cause now I have a little bit less time.
09:19 - I'm managing this channel,
I'm creating content,
09:22 - trying to learn more about business.
09:24 - At the same time learning
actually more about coding,
09:26 - so there's a lot of things happening.
09:29 - Everybody's budget is different.
09:30 - So, it might not be possible
for you to just invest so much
09:34 - in yourself but start with something
09:37 - 'cause ultimately it's a
habit and it's a mindset
09:39 - and it's a pattern.
09:40 - Because if you hold back on
always investing in yourself,
09:43 - you're like five bucks, it's too much,
09:46 - you're training yourself to say
09:48 - that you're not worth it.
09:51 - At a core level what you're saying
09:53 - is that you don't trust in yourself.
09:58 - And one thing I can tell you
10:00 - is you're gonna be the
most important investment
10:04 - and you're the ultimate asset,
10:05 - so if you don't trust in yourself,
10:08 - other things aren't gonna make
you trust in yourself more.
10:12 - So, please focus on that
10:14 - and start making this a habit.
10:17 - When you see a book and if you think
10:18 - you can even get one idea
from this coding book,
10:21 - just get the damn book.
10:23 - It'll be 20 or 30 bucks
worse case scenario
10:27 - and it's somebody's 10 years of experience
10:30 - that they've put down into this one book
10:33 - and if you get one idea
that's helpful for you,
10:36 - that idea will be worth more than the 20
10:39 - or 30 bucks that you pay for it.
10:41 - So, it's a mindset and
what is 20 or 30 bucks?
10:45 - It's like a few meals
10:47 - or for some of us we get
Doritos and freaking Coca-Cola
10:52 - and Pepsi and just skip out on that
10:55 - and get this or if you
don't wanna skip out on it,
10:57 - then just figure out a way
10:58 - to increase your income
and supplement your income
11:01 - so you can get these
things as you go along.
11:04 - I'm a big believer in
investing in yourself
11:06 - as much as you can
11:08 - 'cause that allows you
to grow the fastest.
11:13 - That was a little bit of my story
11:15 - and that's my message for you.
11:17 - Thank you so much for watching.
11:18 - If you have any questions
on how to invest in yourself
11:21 - or you have a certain budget
11:22 - and you're like Qazi, I'm
just like I don't know
11:24 - how to do it, whatever it may be,
11:26 - post it in the comments below,
11:27 - I'll jump in there and
try to help you out.
11:30 - Again, I appreciate you so much
11:31 - for being on my channel,
watching these videos.
