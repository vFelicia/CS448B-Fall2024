00:00 - hey guys welcome back to the
00:02 - objectoriented programming course in
00:03 - Python in this video we are going to
00:07 - continue what we were doing and what
00:10 - we're going to create is something
00:12 - called a bookmark app so remember in the
00:14 - last video I talked about we're going to
00:16 - have a frame with buttons and then when
00:17 - you click them maybe it'll take you
00:18 - somewhere so let's call it the bookmark
00:21 - app and I've created a file up there if
00:24 - you can see that and uh so far let's
00:27 - just see what we have just so we can uh
00:29 - refresh in our memory uh where we're at
00:34 - so essentially it's this app when we run
00:36 - it and if I hit 10 it does nothing if I
00:38 - hit doorbell it detects and it says you
00:41 - rang the doorbell and it essentially
00:43 - runs this function that we wrote on line
00:45 - five cool uh now what we want to do is
00:48 - we want
00:49 - to see if you can try to do this so like
00:52 - pause the video see if you can create a
00:54 - button that detects something else okay
00:57 - if you haven't done that from the last
00:59 - video so let's go ahead and do this now
01:01 - so I'm going to create a new one and
01:03 - essentially what my button is going to
01:05 - do is it's going to take me to the
01:06 - clever programmer. comom website it's
01:09 - going to open up a new tab and take me
01:11 - there so first of all what I have to do
01:13 - is I have to go at the top and import uh
01:15 - the web browser Library so essentially
01:18 - we're stealing code from people who
01:19 - spent hundreds of hours writing it by
01:21 - using the import magical command and
01:24 - we're going to leverage the web browser
01:26 - code and it's going to make our lives
01:28 - very easy and and essential what's going
01:30 - to do is just say web browser. openen
01:33 - new tab and this function takes in a URL
01:36 - so we're going to give it a URL uh we're
01:40 - just going to type it in here
01:43 - https clever program.com for you you can
01:47 - have this button be whatever you want
01:49 - okay and I'm going to
01:53 - say um yeah that looks pretty good to
01:56 - me I'm going to add this as button to
02:00 - bind and I'm going to bind this to the
02:03 - left click as well of The Mouse and the
02:05 - left click short key of the mouse is um
02:10 - this button essentially right here it's
02:12 - button hyphen
02:16 - one and now I'm going to attach this
02:18 - button to the second uh function that we
02:22 - just wrote so this function is going to
02:24 - be called um click
02:27 - CP this function should really be called
02:29 - open CP so I'm going to give it a better
02:32 - name I'm going to say open
02:37 - CP
02:40 - okay all right that looks good to
02:43 - me and uh now instead of the text on it
02:47 - saying 10 let's call it clever
02:52 - programmer and now let's run this code
02:55 - let's run
02:56 - it and as you can see it just created a
02:59 - new
03:00 - frame um that like it added the new
03:03 - button called clever programmer and if I
03:06 - click it in my Chrome it should open a
03:08 - new tab that says clever programmer so
03:10 - let's give it a try I'm going to click
03:12 - it and indeed it did open up clever
03:15 - programmer so that's pretty cool now
03:17 - what if I wanted to add another button
03:19 - that maybe takes me to the blog page so
03:22 - see if you can add that pause this video
03:24 - see if you can add that right now again
03:26 - if you're not pausing this and doing
03:28 - this on your own and really deviating
03:30 - away from the examples I'm just giving
03:32 - you if you're just really only copying
03:34 - the code you're not going to retain any
03:36 - information that's what happens when
03:37 - people take code academy they're not
03:39 - able to retain that information it just
03:41 - gets lost because you might just copy
03:44 - what they have and then not do anything
03:46 - on your own so the more the farther away
03:49 - you go from my examples the better
03:52 - you'll become think of my examples as
03:55 - just an implication of what you can do
03:57 - and then take that and run with it
04:00 - so what I'll tell you is that think of
04:04 - it as your assignment okay take what
04:07 - I've currently given you already in the
04:09 - video and use it to create something
04:11 - cool and add that in the comments below
04:13 - so other people can check out what you
04:15 - have done and it might give them new
04:18 - ideas as well so you know kind of
04:21 - surprise me and everybody else
04:24 - here okay so that's what this does now
04:27 - I'm going to create that blog uh button
04:30 - okay so first of all I'm just going to
04:32 - create the function
04:35 - open uh or let's just call it CP blog
04:40 - takes in an event and we're going to say
04:43 - opens
04:44 - new
04:47 - tab and essentially what it does is it
04:50 - does here let's make our code a little
04:52 - bit better so I'm going to take this guy
04:55 - and I'm going to say URL is equal to
04:58 - that guy and here I'm just going to
05:00 - replace this with URL and here what I'm
05:03 - going to do is I'm going to say URL
05:05 - plus and I'm just going to add blog to
05:08 - it okay so it's going to
05:10 - take this URL here and all it's going to
05:13 - do is it's going to just add blog in
05:15 - front of it that's
05:18 - it so this way I'm reusing my code if I
05:21 - keep having to create new tabs I don't
05:23 - have to write that entire URL over and
05:25 - over again I can do it in a simple way
05:27 - let's go down here I'm going to uh
05:30 - create the third uh label so I'm going
05:33 - to say C
05:34 - label uh is equal to TK label text is
05:39 - equal
05:41 - to
05:42 - whoops
05:44 - blog we can call this
05:47 - home uh C
05:52 - label. grid let's go column two on this
05:57 - guy and let's stay in row zero
06:03 - and then we can say button three is
06:06 - equal to button window add that in the
06:10 - window the text for this should be CP
06:15 - blog and button three for grid let's put
06:20 - that in
06:21 - column I
06:23 - think we can put this button in column
06:27 - two and for row let's keep the row
06:32 - one and now let's go ahead and bind this
06:36 - guy to the left click of the
06:40 - mouse and now we're going to throw in
06:42 - the function CP
06:47 - blog and let's give this a try so I oh I
06:52 - got to end my previous session okay so I
06:55 - just ran my code and you can see I have
06:57 - doorbell which if I click it just says
06:59 - doorbell if I click clever programmer
07:01 - it'll take me to the homepage and for
07:03 - the blog if I click this button it
07:06 - should open up the blog so let me click
07:08 - this and let's see what
07:11 - happens and there you go it just took me
07:14 - to the clever programmer blog page so if
07:17 - you want to learn how to do this in a
07:19 - lot more like for example creating a
07:21 - game of pong or creating a calculator
07:24 - from scratch and creating apps on your
07:28 - own using python python so you connect
07:30 - your python coding knowledge to actually
07:32 - creating apps and you want to learn more
07:34 - about this I've put a link together for
07:36 - you below that you can actually click
07:38 - and just put in your first name and your
07:40 - email address and I'll send you five
07:43 - free exclusive pieces of content from
07:46 - the Learn Python objectoriented
07:48 - Programming course okay there no cost to
07:51 - you and in that course I'll show you how
07:54 - you can do these things by yourself all
07:56 - right so go ahead and put your email
07:59 - address and your first name in there and
08:01 - I'll see you on the other side
