00:00 - hey guys what's up this is kazy from
00:03 - clever program.com where you learn to
00:06 - code smarter now we
00:09 - are probably going to start the infamous
00:11 - series on series series series yeah on
00:18 - learn JavaScript on code academy okay
00:21 - this is probably going to be the best
00:23 - series on learning JavaScript special in
00:27 - code academy so you know
00:30 - just enjoy and and you'll also learn so
00:35 - let's let's jump right into it what is
00:38 - Javascript about and what does it want
00:41 - us to do so a very quick overview
00:45 - JavaScript lets you do all the cool
00:47 - stuff on the web web what's happening to
00:49 - my English when you click on things
00:51 - It'll like open them up all the
00:53 - graphical interfaces all the beautiful
00:55 - user interface almost all of it is done
00:59 - by JavaScript so at the end of the day
01:02 - JavaScript is what makes the Internet
01:04 - run especially nowadays that's the
01:07 - that's the technology that we use uh for
01:11 - all the front end especially so let's go
01:14 - ahead and click on introduction to
01:16 - JavaScript and we'll get started if you
01:19 - check all of these guys all of this
01:21 - stuff is locked it wants you to upgrade
01:24 - it and um but other things are there so
01:27 - for example function scope
01:30 - arrays and loops and you know you guys
01:34 - know my style what I do is if for those
01:36 - of you who are new basically what I do
01:39 - is if I'm trying to explain something
01:42 - I'll open up another terminal or I'll go
01:45 - on this website called repl.it reel.it
01:49 - where I'll show you the code as we're
01:51 - coding it okay so why don't we just get
01:54 - started so let's click introduction to
01:56 - JavaScript let's
01:58 - go all right welcome to learn JavaScript
02:02 - we got our first achievement that's
02:04 - always good JavaScript is the most
02:07 - widely used programming language on the
02:09 - web and is used on most websites
02:11 - including this one so that's kind of
02:13 - essentially what I was saying in the
02:15 - start by the end of this course you'll
02:17 - have a strong foundation in JavaScript
02:19 - you'll be able to write full-fledged
02:20 - programs make HTML and CSS Dynamic and
02:24 - right impressive web applications and if
02:27 - you follow this course with me you will
02:30 - also not be bored and probably have a
02:31 - lot of fun all right I I can't stand
02:35 - boring programming guys so I'm trying to
02:38 - cure that
02:40 - myself this unit has two parts learn the
02:42 - building blocks of JavaScript do some
02:44 - fun stuff with those parts cool hit next
02:48 - to begin let's get started so here we
02:51 - see that we
02:53 - have three variables one is
02:56 - called um
03:00 - okay one is called my string and we set
03:04 - that to undefined my number is also we
03:08 - set it to undefined and another variable
03:11 - my Boolean we set it to undefined VAR is
03:15 - nothing in itself that's basically
03:16 - you're just saying like hey that's going
03:18 - to be my variable okay so again let me
03:22 - have my good Buy reel.it
03:26 - open so when we go over this stuff
03:30 - you know I can show you guys it
03:33 - everything that we're talking about
03:34 - directly so for example I can say varx
03:37 - is equal to 5 and then I can say uh
03:41 - console. log X this is just saying
03:46 - console. log X is just saying hey show
03:48 - me X on the right hand side of the
03:50 - screen so as you can see it showed you
03:53 - five and our variable X we use that
03:55 - there and we use it here one of my
03:58 - favorite variables for those of you guys
04:00 - who might be new here is banana so we're
04:03 - going to use banana I hate looking at
04:06 - x and most programming you'll almost
04:09 - never be writing things like X and stuff
04:11 - other programmers are going to be like
04:13 - what's wrong with this guy he's writing
04:15 - all this cryptic stuff or
04:18 - she right so let's focus
04:21 - on uh calling him something other than x
04:25 - and put more life into them and VAR is
04:28 - just necessary to announce a variable
04:30 - that's really what's Happening Here cool
04:32 - now do not edit the code under this line
04:36 - what are they doing
04:38 - here they're simply saying your name is
04:43 - whatever this was here your lucky
04:46 - number okay what does this do this plus
04:49 - sign this plus business that they have
04:51 - going on let's check it out all
04:55 - right let's check it out we're GNA take
05:00 - their uh my
05:04 - number we're going to put it here right
05:10 - console.log okay so we're not going to
05:13 - make it undefined that's kind of
05:15 - nonsense we're going to make it like
05:18 - four and if I hit run here you can see
05:20 - how it works essentially what we're
05:23 - doing is we're combining this number
05:26 - four with this
05:28 - little thing in the quotes Okay so in
05:32 - programming what the thing that in
05:34 - quotes we call it a string and we're
05:37 - just basically making the string bigger
05:40 - so if we just wrote it like this that
05:44 - would give you an error which is what
05:45 - you can see on the left side it says hey
05:47 - there's a some kind of error going on
05:50 - you can just do some quotation followed
05:53 - by some other thing like a variable if
05:55 - you want to combine the two you use a
05:57 - plus sign to combine the two okay okay
06:00 - the things in quote you're basically
06:02 - saying give me exactly that thing which
06:04 - is why on the right hand
06:06 - side you see lucky number which is above
06:09 - me
06:11 - probably um or sorry the exact string
06:14 - lucky number with a colon my number is
06:17 - the thing that comes from our variable
06:20 - up at the top at line one that we
06:22 - defined so lucky number exactly that
06:25 - plus our variable that we created which
06:28 - is four in this case
06:30 - add it together and boom we get lucky
06:32 - number is equal to four another thing
06:35 - that I want to tell you guys about uh
06:37 - you know when you are following my
06:39 - program is that I'll have all of these
06:41 - notes available for you so as a matter
06:43 - of fact I'm going to hit save on this it
06:46 - has created a link already and I will
06:48 - share this link with you guys so it's
06:49 - going to be called clever programmer
06:53 - JavaScript code academy one all right so
06:58 - you guys can then
07:00 - enjoy and use this as well to learn all
07:03 - right uh the notes are going to be in
07:06 - the description in the link
07:09 - below okay so they're just saying blah
07:11 - blah blah blah blah uh I I already broke
07:13 - all of this down for you uh except for
07:16 - Boolean so we're going to talk about
07:18 - that in one second but as you can see
07:21 - here string or any groupings of texts
07:24 - and things with within the quotes so
07:26 - here when they say name they literally
07:28 - want exact name they don't want the
07:31 - variable name that might be four or five
07:34 - they are trying to say give me exactly
07:36 - the word name with a colon and space
07:39 - after it so whenever you want something
07:41 - to be very exact you use string because
07:44 - that's the that's the thing that you
07:46 - want you don't want anything
07:47 - else uh number okay any number including
07:51 - numbers with decimals without quotes is
07:53 - is a number so for example uh just for
07:57 - your
07:58 - practice right what is that versus what
08:01 - is that
08:04 - okay uh on line five this
08:09 - is um this thing
08:12 - here okay is a quote this thing
08:17 - here is a number okay that's the
08:21 - difference there so I'll put this here
08:24 - for you
08:26 - guys uh string
08:30 - and then this guy at the
08:32 - bottom this is a number okay without the
08:35 - quotes
08:37 - so what does that mean well uh what's
08:41 - the benefit of this if you try doing 4
08:43 - minus
08:45 - 4 you're going to get back something
08:48 - that probably doesn't make
08:52 - sense or I might be surprised in
08:54 - JavaScript so yeah in JavaScript I am
08:57 - surprised uh it's able to subtract subst
09:00 - substra sub subtract
09:04 - strings but you can't do that in most of
09:07 - their languages you would have to do
09:08 - four minus 4 like that okay usually you
09:12 - can't compare and subtract strings but
09:14 - JavaScript is being really smart and
09:16 - it's going hey don't worry I know what
09:18 - you mean I'll I'll do I'll do the right
09:21 - thing for you okay 23.4 two is also a
09:25 - number all right now let's move on to
09:27 - Boolean Boolean is something like true
09:30 - or false all right so if you say true or
09:33 - false that's your Boolean the reason why
09:36 - these are going to be important is you
09:37 - can say hey
09:39 - if Johnny cleaned the dishes is true
09:44 - then
09:45 - display you can play Xbox 360 now
09:50 - Johnny or if Johnny cleaned the dishes
09:53 - is equal to false then maybe you can
09:56 - console.log or print out or whatever
09:58 - like no you can't play Xbox 360 or
10:02 - whatever all right so true and false is
10:05 - the heart of programming this is the
10:07 - zero and one or whatever way you hear of
10:10 - it I like the true or false way more
10:12 - than just the zero or one
10:14 - way so that's really essentially what
10:17 - that is okay and those are your Boolean
10:20 - values anything that evalue is to true
10:22 - or false okay is four less than four is
10:27 - that true or false what do you think
10:33 - it's false okay four is not less than
10:35 - four so this is your Boolean kind of
10:39 - logic did um I don't
10:43 - know did your worker or your cowork or
10:47 - your employee work more than 40 hours if
10:49 - so pay them overtime okay so again
10:53 - you're going to have maybe you know uh
10:55 - let's Define a variable called overtime
10:59 - and we can set that to 40 hours and we
11:02 - can
11:03 - say uh yeah so let's see we can have a
11:09 - variable Bob hours and we can say that
11:14 - he worked 41 hours and then we can go
11:18 - down here and check hey did are Bob's
11:22 - working hours greater than the overtime
11:26 - hours let's see what it says and you can
11:29 - see on the right hand side it says true
11:32 - so if this is true then maybe we pay Bob
11:35 - over time
11:37 - okay all right so the stuff that I've
11:40 - shown you guys is you know I'm kind of
11:43 - jumping the gun and showing you guys the
11:45 - stuff that's going to happen next so a
11:47 - lot of the stuff that they're going to
11:48 - show next I'm already showing you guys
11:50 - so if I ever go on tangent it's it's a
11:52 - helpful tangent it's well sometimes it
11:54 - might not be but most of the times it
11:56 - will be all right now let's see what
11:58 - they're talking about about here are
11:59 - their
12:01 - instructions so in the code editor there
12:03 - are three variables we will learn about
12:05 - variables in the next lesson again I
12:09 - already covered this right so you guys
12:11 - kind of know what a variable is replace
12:14 - each variable's value with each
12:16 - corresponding
12:18 - type okay so for my string they want us
12:22 - to put something that's a string so
12:24 - let's say Bob like that okay um for my
12:28 - number let's actually put in a number so
12:30 - we'll say seven and for my Boolean we'll
12:33 - put in a Boolean and remember what
12:34 - booleans are there's something that are
12:36 - either true or false in this case we'll
12:38 - just put in
12:40 - false
12:42 - okay on line one there's a variable
12:45 - named my
12:46 - string
12:48 - so replace undefined with a string your
12:52 - name so sure we can you know put in my
12:55 - name or
12:57 - something all right right and we don't
13:00 - really need the hints let's just run it
13:02 - let's see what happens see what it
13:07 - says it's running it it's running
13:11 - it it's running it for a little bit
13:13 - longer than expected I'm worried if I'm
13:16 - stuck in the
13:18 - infamous code academy Loop oh looks like
13:22 - I'm
13:24 - not so did I win did I pass everything
13:29 - okay so as you can see the first thing
13:31 - is done the second thing is done the
13:33 - third thing is done fourth thing is done
13:34 - so I think we're good um and on the
13:38 - right hand side you can see that it
13:40 - says name is Raf Kazi lucky number seven
13:44 - right this is what line8 is doing it's
13:47 - combining the word lucky number with my
13:50 - number and then on line nine you can
13:53 - also see that it's combining good joke
13:56 - with this so was a joke good false was
14:01 - the lucky what's the lucky number seven
14:03 - my name is rafik Kazi
14:06 - cool and we can't do much programming
14:10 - with our knowledge of types right now so
14:11 - let's build something cool let's learn
14:14 - how to ask JavaScript to talk to us oo
14:17 - how will JavaScript talk to us to do
14:20 - this we need to do two things a way to
14:22 - ask JavaScript to talk and two something
14:25 - for JavaScript to say okay we can ask
14:29 - ask JavaScript to print words to the
14:31 - console with this line of code you guys
14:34 - are already pros at this and I've
14:36 - already shown you this but I'm just
14:38 - going to put that right here and at the
14:39 - bottom you're going to see that it says
14:41 - your message here so that's essentially
14:43 - what that does let's go back in human
14:46 - speak this is saying hey console please
14:48 - print log this thing inside the
14:50 - parenthesis bye
14:52 - thanks they're funny I like their
14:55 - jokes
14:57 - cheeky but writing this line we have
15:00 - also solved the second thing we need
15:01 - something for JavaScript to say we can
15:04 - put a string number Boolean or any other
15:09 - data type inside the parentheses of a
15:11 - console.log again you saw that we were
15:14 - putting less than signs we were putting
15:15 - true and false putting pretty much
15:17 - anything between the console.log
15:20 - function that prints out your thing use
15:23 - console. loock to log a string of your
15:27 - favorite pizza
15:30 - topping okay so we can say
15:33 - console.log and for our favorite pizza
15:36 - topping I don't know let's
15:39 - say jalapeno I I really like jalapenos
15:43 - so we're going to put that we have to
15:45 - put the semicolon that's something you
15:47 - guys will get used to ja JavaScript is
15:50 - really smart even if you don't put the
15:51 - semicolon it'll know what you're talking
15:53 - about but there's certain cases where
15:55 - you're going to run into really weird
15:56 - errors later on in your life that might
15:59 - cost you millions of dollars so there
16:02 - are all kinds of horrific stories about
16:04 - not putting semicolons in JavaScript
16:07 - so don't let javascript's smartness fool
16:11 - you into not putting semicolons go ahead
16:13 - and do that anyways all right let's run
16:16 - this bad boy and let's see what we get
16:18 - we get back
16:20 - jalapeno fun fact we can log multiple
16:23 - things at once by separating them with
16:25 - commas so we can say jalapenos
16:29 - and or jalapeno and we can say I don't
16:32 - know
16:34 - pineapple so by doing this you can have
16:37 - it print out multiple things as you can
16:39 - see here all right cool yes
16:47 - awesome I don't
16:49 - know all right let's hit next and the
16:53 - last thing we're going to leave this off
16:55 - at is do some math and we're going to
16:58 - leave off there all right so it's
17:01 - telling you that you can do some basic
17:03 - math okay you can do things like adding
17:06 - subtracting multiplying dividing okay
17:09 - you want to be that cool kid in the
17:10 - class that extremely cool kid right that
17:15 - uh does math not on his
17:18 - calculator but on his laptop sure that
17:23 - will make you cool but um in the world
17:27 - of people who program they'll definitely
17:31 - give you some bonus
17:33 - points so essentially I can say 5 -
17:37 - 3 and it'll show you on the right hand
17:40 - side I can say uh 5 *
17:45 - 25 console. log I don't know 25 ided 5
17:50 - let's see what we
17:53 - get 5 divided by 5.2 we get some weird
17:57 - big number here
17:59 - right so all your calculator stuff
18:02 - JavaScript can handle it for
18:05 - you let's see what it says these all
18:07 - work you might guess uh-huh okay so
18:12 - console log add 3.5 to your age so let's
18:15 - do
18:16 - that so I'm going to say 3.5 plus my age
18:20 - is
18:21 - 22 and that's looks good inside another
18:25 - console.log take the current year and
18:27 - subtract so I'm going to say
18:29 - console.log and I'm going to take the
18:31 - current year so 2016 minus
18:35 - 1969 that should give me the difference
18:38 - between 2016 and
18:41 - 1969 probably a lot of years so it's
18:45 - been
18:47 - um oh that will give you the number of
18:50 - years it's been since the moon has land
18:52 - oh since we landed on the moon so we
18:55 - landed on the moon in 1969
18:59 - they want us to create another console.
19:02 - log that does 65 by 240 so okay
19:10 - console.log
19:12 - divide 65 by 240 so just like
19:18 - that another
19:20 - console.log then multiply the full
19:22 - answer from step three by
19:25 - 100 so I guess what I can do is I can
19:28 - can do 65 / 40 *
19:33 - 100 okay and I can put this guy in
19:37 - parentheses just to say do this
19:39 - operation first and then multiply that
19:41 - result by
19:43 - 100 that's the percent of the Sun that
19:45 - is made up of helium assuming we could
19:47 - stand on the sun we' all sound like
19:53 - chipmunks oh that's pretty cool
19:59 - so 27% of the sun
20:02 - is made up of helium fun
20:07 - fact okay guys so you saw JavaScript
20:11 - lets us do some for now we went through
20:15 - some really basic things but you can see
20:17 - that we're going to be building up to
20:19 - some really great and epic things right
20:21 - we are even going to be able to build
20:23 - our own games with JavaScript if code
20:26 - academy doesn't cover it and they want
20:28 - to make money off of you guys but having
20:30 - all these pro versions then after the
20:32 - code academy course is done I will make
20:35 - up some projects with JavaScript that
20:37 - you guys can follow along and do without
20:39 - having to pay a single
20:41 - scent all right guys I love you guys I
20:44 - appreciate you guys if this is your
20:46 - first time please subscribe to the
20:48 - channel if it's not your first time and
20:50 - you haven't subscribed subscribe like
20:52 - the video you'll see many more coming
20:54 - like this shortly take care guys I'll
20:57 - see you in the next video
21:27 - for for
