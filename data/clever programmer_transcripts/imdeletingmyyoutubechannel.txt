00:05 - what's up guys how's it going um
00:07 - it's a hard day for me today
00:09 - as you can see from the title of the
00:12 - video
00:13 - it's true you know man it's been a
00:16 - really great journey honestly like all
00:19 - these last five years uh going into
00:21 - almost the sixth year now working on
00:23 - this channel it started in 2016 and it
00:25 - was just so much fun building out these
00:27 - videos for you guys you know teaching
00:30 - you guys coding giving you guys more
00:32 - skills um it was super fun honestly like
00:35 - i really enjoyed this process and i feel
00:37 - like i've changed in that journey but
00:40 - honestly i just you know um yeah like i
00:43 - it's
00:45 - just not fulfilling anymore i just have
00:47 - to keep coming in every single day and
00:49 - making these videos and you know
00:52 - it doesn't feel good anymore and i just
00:55 - you know i wanted to be able to keep
00:56 - doing this forever
00:58 - but you know i think for me the time has
01:01 - come to end this journey on youtube i
01:03 - think clever programmer is done and i
01:06 - just thank you guys for being part of
01:08 - this amazing journey honestly like it
01:10 - was so much fun being able to share all
01:12 - these moments with you guys learn more
01:14 - coding myself with you guys and build
01:17 - new things every single day or every
01:20 - single week and and bring it but i think
01:22 - there are a lot of other things that i
01:23 - want to chase for example now i'm
01:25 - training for chess and i'm trying to you
01:28 - know increase my rating of almost a 2
01:30 - 100 rated players so i want to start
01:32 - competing in chess more often and
01:34 - there's a tournament going on in vegas
01:36 - june and so i'm going to be going there
01:38 - and playing there's just a lot of other
01:39 - paths that i want to be you know kind of
01:41 - embarking on maybe there might be some
01:43 - other youtube channels i might start but
01:45 - i think for now this is it
01:48 - this is the end of this journey it has
01:50 - been amazing knowing all of you guys but
01:52 - you know i think i'm going to be
01:54 - deleting this channel primarily just
01:55 - because there's better work that i think
01:58 - i'm going to be able to do in the future
02:00 - and i just want to start off with the
02:01 - clean slate honestly you know just start
02:04 - off with the clean slate so you know in
02:06 - the next few days i think this channel
02:08 - should be completely deleted and um yeah
02:11 - so that's that but outside of that i
02:13 - mean mainly i will you know uh still be
02:16 - on instagram so you guys could hit me up
02:18 - there and i would um you know i really
02:21 - want to see all of you keep succeeding
02:23 - in the journey of programming and
02:25 - learning coding and you know learning
02:27 - blockchain skills or whatever it is that
02:29 - the journey that you're on it means a
02:31 - lot to me and it means a lot to me that
02:33 - you were here to support and i know some
02:35 - of you have been supporting the channel
02:36 - since the start since 2016 so huge shout
02:39 - out to all of those people or 2017 and
02:41 - even if you're brand new you know
02:43 - honestly a huge shout out to you thank
02:44 - you for being a part of this and you
02:46 - know i've been a developer and now i
02:49 - think the time for me has come to move
02:51 - past that and go on to a new venture
02:54 - and just learn something new because i
02:56 - think after i've learned something and
02:57 - mastered it enough my personalities i
03:00 - want to move on and do new things in the
03:02 - world and create new things and come up
03:03 - with new ideas and that that's what
03:05 - excites me personally
03:07 - in terms of you know question you might
03:08 - have in your mind like qazi what are you
03:10 - going to be doing now well i don't know
03:12 - you know i don't know but i'm going to
03:13 - be doing probably going to be taking a
03:15 - little bit of a break maybe i'll go to
03:16 - another country go do some soul
03:18 - searching there
03:19 - yeah that's probably what i'm going to
03:21 - be doing you know that's uh seems like
03:23 - what the next steps are and just kind of
03:25 - take it easy relax a little bit enjoy
03:28 - life because i feel like i've been
03:29 - getting burned out recently it's just
03:31 - been super stressful you know and so i
03:34 - feel like that would be the best thing
03:36 - for me to do just relax take it easy and
03:39 - maybe you know a few years later come
03:41 - back and do something else on youtube or
03:44 - or whatever it may be but i think for
03:46 - now that's where i'm at honestly i'm you
03:48 - know so many feelings so many mixed so
03:50 - many mixed emotions and uh yeah
03:53 - that's really it i mean honestly i don't
03:55 - know i'm sorry i'm even making this
03:56 - video like what's the point of it i
03:58 - should just do it right but i don't know
