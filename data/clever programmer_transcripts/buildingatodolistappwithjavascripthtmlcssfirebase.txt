00:00 - are doing amazing so good to see you all
00:03 - today we are building a to-do list
00:07 - application
00:08 - using javascript using html using css
00:12 - and of course using firebase as well so
00:15 - we're going to be building a beautiful
00:17 - app right it was it was designed by
00:20 - fronted mentor right which you guys can
00:22 - go ahead and of course check it out by
00:24 - front-end mentor
00:25 - and you know i mean you can do all the
00:27 - simple things for example you can add it
00:29 - to your item like for example watch a
00:31 - youtube tutorial you know hopefully you
00:33 - guys don't watch too many of them
00:35 - hit enter right it cops to the top right
00:37 - you can hover over them of course you
00:39 - can make you can
00:40 - check them right they're completed you
00:42 - can uncheck them if you would make them
00:44 - want to make them uncompleted
00:46 - and the cool thing is this is using
00:47 - javascript it's using html it's using
00:49 - css it's using firebase to store all
00:52 - this data right as you can see on the
00:54 - right hand side what do we have here
00:56 - we're creating these for example you
00:58 - know uh a way to create our input as you
01:01 - can see for example there's a way where
01:03 - if i go ahead and do this this right
01:04 - here tells us
01:06 - the same thing is what this tells us
01:07 - right to create the input
01:09 - inside here then we'll actually
01:11 - generating to do items
01:13 - in here right but we're generating to do
01:15 - items using using what using a uh um
01:20 - using right here look at this using
01:22 - firebase
01:23 - so this is something you might have seen
01:24 - maybe you have not seen
01:26 - but using five is to get the data from a
01:28 - database right and just to show you how
01:31 - it looks like let me show you it's
01:33 - really cool so for example
01:35 - right here this is my data you see right
01:37 - here this is my data right here
01:40 - okay see all of my items are stored just
01:42 - like this there's a status called active
01:45 - or completed and then there's an actual
01:46 - text so for example if i want to delete
01:49 - the text let me show you here for a
01:50 - second
01:51 - if i want to delete this you will see
01:53 - that it actually live updates the
01:55 - database or the application look at this
01:58 - all right and live up this application
02:00 - so for example let me delete this um let
02:02 - me see this first one right here it says
02:04 - watching tutorial i'm gonna say on this
02:06 - one i'm gonna delete document delete it
02:08 - now watch that watch this left portion
02:10 - right here watch this watch it watch it
02:14 - boom gone just like that right this is
02:16 - an actual live
02:18 - real-time database application that
02:21 - we'll be using and of course as we
02:23 - update the com the status you can see
02:25 - for example if i mark this this is
02:27 - completed you can see that this gets uh
02:31 - turned into completed if i click it
02:33 - again
02:34 - this turns into active just like that
02:37 - right so again very very very useful
02:39 - application it looks amazing beautiful
02:41 - and there's a lot you can learn just
02:43 - from a simple to-do app all right
02:45 - but let's go and get started guys uh as
02:48 - you know this is you built by for the
02:50 - mentor so feel free to check them out
02:51 - there's a link down below you could just
02:53 - go to fundamental right here
02:55 - and get all the files uh for from them
02:58 - on this application so if you go to
03:00 - challenges
03:01 - and then if you search up to do right
03:04 - here to do app here's your app right
03:06 - here just you can go ahead and go to
03:08 - this challenge i will i'll actually copy
03:09 - this if you want because i want to check
03:11 - it out
03:12 - right here here's your link and i'll for
03:13 - the zoom chat as well i'll copy this in
03:15 - for you guys too so you guys can have it
03:21 - right here
03:22 - right here i'll set this up for you guys
03:23 - too so every you can guys can go ahead
03:25 - down download all the files that you
03:27 - need to download and use them but also i
03:29 - also have a github page that actually
03:31 - has all the javascript you know so if
03:33 - you want to follow along with me um

04:28 - always always like okay
04:31 - i'm gonna put my code to the side here
04:32 - i'm gonna use a cheat sheet guys okay
04:34 - don't judge me if you if i use a cheat

12:42 - to
12:44 - to grab the data
12:47 - from the database
12:48 - database
12:51 - database
12:54 - oh
12:56 - so many people are already using this
12:57 - already it's crazy
12:58 - [Music]
13:01 - i might have to change my firebase
13:03 - application don't worry i'm not changing
13:06 - a little bit
13:08 - that's right right so
13:11 - let's go next one nine
13:14 - right so create the functionality to
13:16 - grab the data okay awesome suede
13:18 - after that what i want to do is after i
13:21 - did i want to be able to what
13:22 - be able to update it by what so if i
13:24 - click on the check mark i should be able
13:26 - to update it correct
13:28 - yeah that's right so let's go ahead and
13:30 - create a
13:32 - functionality to update the data
13:37 - with what
13:38 - with
13:39 - what with the new status the new status
13:43 - of completed
13:45 - or active depending
13:48 - that's right that's right okay so at
13:51 - this point and then honestly at this
13:52 - point it's pretty much done i'm gonna
13:54 - have you guys do this portion for the
13:56 - homework so our focus is going to be
13:58 - making sure this all works perfectly
14:00 - okay and then your book is gonna be okay
14:02 - well how can i clear for example things
14:04 - or how can i filter it by active or
14:05 - completed this is where you guys have to
14:07 - do some research to make sure this
14:08 - actually fully works okay
14:11 - beautiful
14:12 - so next one let's go the first part is
14:15 - going to be what create the boxes we
14:16 - need to create so the boxes are well a
14:18 - few boxes of integrate here
14:21 - as you guys know it's going to be what
14:25 - this box
14:26 - right this box i'm going to create this
14:29 - box right here after that you need to
14:31 - create this box portion beautiful all
14:34 - right and then honestly it's pretty much
14:36 - and of course there's this box to make
14:37 - sure that we have this background image
14:39 - right
14:40 - so
14:41 - based on this the first thing i'm going
14:43 - to do is create the banner background
14:45 - image that's part one for me right away
14:47 - right away okay
14:49 - now can anybody tell me how maybe we can
14:53 - do that
14:54 - what would you do to create a banner
14:56 - background image like this
14:59 - okay
15:00 - what do we do to create a banner
15:01 - background image well a few things i
15:03 - would do personally
15:04 - is i'll just create a dip correct guys
15:07 - so let's do coin creative so let's say
15:09 - div
15:11 - day of class
15:13 - i will say
15:14 - background
15:17 - dash image
15:19 - okay dash image
15:21 - and
15:24 - and then that's just a background image
15:25 - just like that okay
15:27 - now this is the background that's going
15:28 - to be
15:30 - this portion right here all right this
15:32 - portion right here
15:33 - okay
15:34 - now inside that we're going to create an
15:36 - actual image here
15:38 - image image source
15:42 - is equal to what
15:46 - image source is equal to what
15:49 - well
15:50 - we don't have the acetate just yet so
15:52 - what we can do guys is we can actually
15:54 - download these assets so let's go to our
15:56 - githubs that we have down below for
15:58 - those of you who are on you know on zoom
16:01 - already sent you guys the github okay go
16:04 - to github let's go and click the code
16:06 - download as a zip so we have it
16:08 - okay beautiful
16:09 - let's go to uncover this
16:14 - that's gonna cover this one okay
16:16 - beautiful
16:18 - uncover that all right now with that
16:21 - being said with that being said
16:25 - with that being said what are we gonna
16:27 - do well we've got the assets right here
16:30 - let's take all these assets we have and
16:32 - transfer them into our assets so it's a
16:34 - new file
16:35 - or a new folder
16:38 - assets right here new folder assets okay
16:41 - i'm going to take these icons little
16:43 - small icons
16:45 - and i'm only going to do just simply
16:47 - drag
16:50 - into the assets folder like that boom
16:53 - done
16:54 - everybody see that all i did was i
16:55 - simply took it and i dragged it into the
16:58 - access folder and that's it my friends
16:59 - that's all you have to do okay
17:02 - all you to do
17:03 - right
17:05 - okay
17:06 - somebody said why don't just write diff
17:08 - container because i have a lot more fun
17:10 - using you know create writing up the
17:12 - actual diff guys
17:14 - somebody said why don't you just use a
17:16 - shortcut of div dot container
17:18 - like no for me i like to write out like
17:20 - this
17:21 - which is fine
17:23 - okay so we've got the assets now and the
17:25 - answer that we're going to use for this
17:26 - one is going to be the bg desktop dark
17:29 - right so we'll do image source and we'll
17:31 - say here what assets
17:33 - right
17:36 - dg
17:37 - bg that's the dark just like that save
17:39 - that that's all we need save that
17:42 - all right
17:44 - save that and that's it then i go back
17:47 - to my style of css and of course at this
17:49 - point let's let's actually check out
17:51 - what's going on so
17:53 - i will go ahead and i will go ahead and
17:54 - right click on this
17:57 - right click on index.html and i will go
17:58 - ahead and open with a live server so
18:00 - make sure you do that right now
18:02 - hey there we go so what do we see right
18:04 - away we have this image
18:06 - that's right this and of course you see
18:08 - how we have the spacing around it any
18:11 - anybody know why that's the case
18:14 - why is that the case
18:18 - can anybody guess
18:20 - curious and can anybody guess why that's
18:21 - the case that's why i said margin so by
18:24 - default the body has actual margin so if
18:27 - i go to style the css i'm going to
18:28 - remove all the margins so
18:30 - for the margin i'm going to say
18:32 - star which you guys know what that means
18:34 - already the store i'm going to say
18:35 - margin 0
18:38 - heading 0
18:41 - okay done let's see right there margin
18:43 - disappears i'm going to say box sizing
18:48 - i'm going to say border box that's just
18:50 - something you usually want to do to make
18:51 - it a little bit easier for us okay
18:54 - and honestly that's that's pretty much
18:55 - it on our side but of course this image
18:58 - is just not see it does not extend to
19:00 - full screen so we cannot just do that
19:03 - there's a few things we need to create
19:06 - one
19:06 - let's look at our actual what's it
19:08 - called let me see him open up this down
19:10 - the css here beautiful
19:12 - all right what do you need to do well a
19:14 - few things um
19:15 - [Music]
19:17 - oh if you guys have a live background
19:18 - please meet yourselves thank you
19:21 - all right
19:22 - i'm going to work on this specific
19:24 - background image now can anybody know
19:26 - how do we make sure that the spectrum
19:28 - image is behind any application that
19:30 - might be here
19:33 - how do we do that how do we make sure
19:34 - this background image is actually behind
19:35 - anything here can anybody take a guess
19:37 - on what we do in situations like these
19:42 - st yeah it can be sticky yeah
19:45 - that's right militia position absolute
19:49 - position absolute so let's go ahead and
19:50 - do that so i'm i will target this
19:52 - background image
19:54 - that background image boom
19:56 - oh god my stylist here says i'll say
19:58 - that background image
19:59 - and i say this one i'm actually going to
20:01 - create this div as an absolute deal
20:03 - because why absolute means what absolute
20:05 - means hey you know what i'm just going
20:07 - to stick to whatever you tell me to
20:09 - stick to right if i have something
20:12 - for example and i tell you hey you know
20:14 - what position it you know absolutely to
20:17 - the body right what's going to happen is
20:20 - i'm going to say hey
20:21 - position at zero pixels from the top
20:24 - zero pixels from the left and then maybe
20:26 - zero pixels from the right
20:28 - and so what that's going to do which is
20:29 - really interesting is actually going to
20:30 - stretch out this this a little div to go
20:34 - all the way to the top to the left and
20:36 - to the right
20:37 - stretching out there so check this out
20:39 - guys i want to show you here
20:41 - position
20:43 - absolute
20:44 - right
20:45 - then i'm going to say what top
20:48 - zero
20:50 - bottom
20:52 - bottom zero
20:54 - okay
20:55 - then i'm going to say what
20:57 - tab zero no now i should not forget
20:59 - bottom zero top zero you wanna do left
21:01 - zero
21:04 - and then finally right
21:06 - right zero
21:07 - now why am i doing this because what
21:09 - this is doing is stretching this div out
21:11 - from the left to the right hand side
21:14 - from the left to the right hand side
21:15 - that's right correct
21:16 - all right
21:18 - let me see this
21:20 - so now you can take a look at this right
21:22 - of course the image still does not
21:23 - stretch out but if i right click on this
21:25 - inspect element guys
21:28 - if i show you where is my inspector on
21:30 - here
21:31 - oh
21:32 - no
21:33 - right here
21:34 - you see this whole background image is
21:36 - actually the full screen width
21:39 - because i'm saying hey
21:41 - position it absolutely meaning it's like
21:44 - it's like basically you're sticking
21:45 - something like a like almost like a
21:47 - painting
21:48 - you're sticking a painting to a wall
21:50 - it's what you're doing basically if to
21:51 - give you a small reference right you're
21:54 - sticking a painting to a wall
21:56 - now because we have the background image
21:57 - as the full width now
21:59 - what needs what do we need to do well
22:02 - we could be really smart about it and we
22:03 - can actually say the following i'm going
22:04 - to say
22:05 - here uh
22:08 - i'm going to say here
22:09 - i'm going to give it a max height
22:11 - that's part one
22:15 - height of
22:17 - 350 pixels
22:20 - like this okay to make sure we only have
22:22 - specific height okay
22:25 - then what i'm gonna do is the following
22:27 - i'm gonna say
22:29 - let me target the actual background
22:30 - image image so i'm gonna say
22:33 - actually i'm gonna say min height as
22:34 - well
22:36 - min
22:38 - height there we go okay
22:41 - i'm gonna talk about the actual
22:42 - background image and i'm gonna say the
22:43 - following let's say
22:45 - dot background image
22:47 - image
22:48 - right here
22:50 - beautiful
22:51 - i'm going to make this image stretch out
22:52 - the full width so width of 100
22:56 - save that this out you can see here
22:59 - now it's full width of 100 okay but of
23:01 - course now it's like it's it changes the
23:03 - height you know and i do not want that
23:06 - so
23:07 - i'm going to say what
23:08 - [Music]
23:10 - height
23:11 - of a hundred percent for this one
23:15 - and i'm going to say object fit
23:20 - fit
23:21 - cover
23:23 - boom
23:25 - now let me see here let me inspect them
23:27 - on this one
23:30 - so we have this right here
23:32 - the image is with 100 and height for
23:34 - some reason
23:38 - the div is bigger than the image why is
23:40 - that the case height
23:42 - that's so interesting
23:46 - with 100 and height of also 100 but it's
23:49 - not really thinking about that so okay
23:51 - that's fine i'm just at the height of
23:52 - 350 pixels that's fine in that case two
23:54 - so i'm gonna say
23:55 - height of actually it's going to be 350
23:57 - pixels as well
24:02 - there we go okay and so right here now
24:05 - we have this okay now of course you can
24:07 - see what's happening here is that it's
24:09 - trying to fit up if it as much of the
24:11 - div as possible i give it a height right
24:13 - here
24:14 - i give it a height oh i think i know why
24:16 - this is not working because i need to
24:17 - give this a height
24:19 - so if i give this a height
24:21 - and i say this height of 100 then it
24:23 - will work
24:25 - oops
24:27 - oops
24:28 - there we go
24:30 - i need to give my parent a height and
24:32 - then that way i can give this a height
24:33 - of 100 so it will fit the
24:35 - the actual as much as possible so guys
24:37 - right so look we have the object cover
24:39 - now what i do want to do is i do want to
24:41 - make sure that it kind of stretches from
24:43 - the left hand side and it's not like
24:44 - going away i don't like that so i'm
24:46 - going to use something called object
24:47 - position
24:49 - position
24:51 - and this one's going to be left
24:54 - right so it's always come from the left
24:56 - hand side and so when i stretch it out
24:57 - you see it's just all this is just
24:59 - stretching out the actual div that's all
25:00 - doing that's it
25:02 - that's the smart part about this okay so
25:04 - look the background image is there of
25:06 - course bracket image is there the next
25:08 - portion we're gonna need to work on is
25:10 - what
25:12 - is actually the container is actually
25:13 - the full on you know the full-on thing
25:16 - that's going to contain this application
25:18 - oh my god some so much
25:20 - some of you you guys just like
25:22 - completely erased everything for me
25:25 - so right here
25:27 - right if i go ahead and take a look at
25:28 - this
25:30 - there's one specific container that
25:32 - controls everything guys we want to
25:34 - create a wrapper
25:36 - okay with the could wrap with that we'll
25:38 - make sure to control everything so for
25:41 - example
25:42 - if i'm gonna take this right here let me
25:44 - go ahead and zoom this out
25:46 - you see anybody see how this is the same
25:47 - width all the time
25:50 - well
25:54 - brandon asked the question what does
25:55 - object fit me in good question so
25:57 - let me look at the stellar css so brenda
26:00 - asks what does object fit mean
26:02 - so what does it mean well it means that
26:03 - the image inside that the actual image
26:06 - right
26:07 - is going to try and not stretch out the
26:09 - most important thing with an image if
26:11 - it's being stretched out is to keep the
26:12 - aspect ratio right making sure it's not
26:14 - doesn't look like weird if i don't do
26:16 - this you will see that it starts to get
26:18 - a little bit crazy emc here
26:21 - like
26:22 - i mean maybe not so crazy
26:25 - but if i stretch it out it's not gonna
26:27 - be the best the way that it should be
26:29 - the object cover what it does is it kind
26:31 - of makes it make sure that
26:33 - while you don't stretch the image you
26:34 - know uh while losing or to lose its uh
26:38 - aspect ratio number two
26:41 - it's like saying hey i'm going to take
26:44 - up as much space in this iphone as
26:45 - possible while keeping my aspect ratio
26:48 - all all in check okay
26:50 - that's right retro it makes the image
26:52 - big enough to fit the area without
26:53 - stretching the image actually that's
26:55 - probably the best explanation i've heard
26:56 - so far
26:58 - right so now that's right no stretch
27:00 - marks right retro right no stretch marks
27:02 - that's why it's so important
27:04 - otherwise they can you know imagine
27:06 - stretching you know
27:09 - that's right that's right that's right
27:10 - correct awesome sweet so we got that
27:12 - portion next portion is gonna be well
27:14 - let's create the container so i'm gonna
27:16 - create a container that will contain
27:17 - this whole thing right here i'm gonna
27:19 - call it the container
27:21 - okay
27:22 - so let's go ahead and do that i'm gonna
27:23 - say
27:25 - day of class
27:27 - is equal to container
27:30 - like this the classic container okay
27:33 - and then inside the container a few
27:34 - things we need to take care of well one
27:36 - what is inside this container well we
27:37 - have this header portion that's part one
27:40 - so let's create this one i'm gonna say
27:42 - div class is equal to what header
27:46 - like that okay and inside the header
27:48 - portion what do we have we have what the
27:50 - title and then we have what the the
27:52 - theme because this is to change dark
27:54 - theme to light theme
27:56 - so here we have do class is equal to
27:58 - what title
28:01 - okay
28:03 - and then this will be like a to-do title
28:06 - and finally after that is going to be
28:08 - div
28:10 - class
28:11 - uh what
28:12 - theme
28:14 - boom and so that's going to be
28:16 - image
28:17 - source
28:19 - right
28:20 - and the only image you're going to use
28:21 - simply is just assets
28:23 - and we're just going to use the
28:25 - icon sun image
28:27 - that's it guys save that right there and
28:30 - so now we see of course it's actually
28:32 - not showing up can anybody tell me why
28:34 - this is not showing up properly
28:38 - okay
28:39 - why is this not showing up
28:42 - anybody know what do you think
28:45 - why is the actual this to do thing is
28:47 - not showing up
28:49 - it's on a div what do you mean by that
28:50 - sean
28:52 - that's right lucas the image is actually
28:54 - in the front so
28:56 - to make sure this image is in the back
28:58 - what do we do well
29:00 - we go to the stylus css and i actually i
29:02 - actually changed the z index is the
29:04 - index basically is like it's like a
29:06 - layer it's like you know there's layers
29:08 - there's layer on top layer on top layer
29:09 - on top layer it's like for example
29:11 - you're just layering like if you ever
29:12 - anybody here has used photoshop you can
29:14 - layer things right
29:17 - same situation here
29:20 - okay does the index controls like what
29:22 - layer are you if i'm gonna say
29:24 - hey
29:25 - make the layer right here
29:28 - the underlayer using something called -1
29:32 - right if i do this
29:34 - right there look at this the to do shows
29:36 - up right here you guys can see right
29:38 - there it's right there guys it's up
29:39 - right there
29:40 - all right beautiful
29:42 - so that's exactly what we want
29:44 - all right so let's go ahead and work on
29:45 - this one i will go ahead and
29:48 - work on this header let's go to our
29:51 - stylus css save that
29:53 - okay
29:55 - beautiful
29:56 - okay
29:57 - all right and in the header well
30:02 - actually before that had been to work on
30:04 - the container let me go and look at the
30:05 - containers i'm gonna say what the
30:07 - container
30:08 - right the whole container
30:10 - i'm going to give it the container a
30:12 - width of 100 so it can change
30:14 - because i want to be uh you know mobile
30:16 - friendly
30:17 - but i'm going to give it a max width i'm
30:19 - going to say hey the max width you can
30:20 - take up
30:22 - is going to be 700 pixels
30:25 - right that's going to control how big
30:28 - this width is right here this whole
30:30 - width right here
30:32 - okay max 700 pixels and i'm going to say
30:35 - hey
30:36 - margin
30:38 - the top margin is 0 pixels but then
30:42 - the the left and right margin is going
30:43 - to be 30 pixels
30:46 - just make sure there's spacing here okay
30:48 - okay
30:50 - and then i'm going to give a margin top

43:30 - so you see it's a width of 100 which is
43:32 - really good
43:33 - let's not give it a height now
43:35 - oh 70 pixels

43:41 - do you write all css gmail just given
43:44 - yes actually i do brenda yes i do
43:47 - everything is from scratch i write
43:48 - everything from scratch
43:50 - i mean that's the way to do it guys if
43:51 - you guys want to be coders you have to
43:52 - write it from scratch right like
43:55 - unfortunately when you go to a job
43:57 - you're not going to have the code a lot
43:58 - of the time sometimes you will have to
43:59 - have the you will have the code that you
44:01 - have to learn how to work with
44:03 - but you know if you want to actually
44:05 - you know write code you have to know how
44:08 - to write from scratch from the beginning
44:09 - from nothing from literally zero
44:12 - just how what i'm doing right here is
44:14 - i'm creating the starting points right
44:16 - right yes it is actually a lot easier to
44:18 - start from scratch sometimes that's
44:19 - right it is sometimes because sometimes
44:21 - actually really hard to you know to
44:23 - fully understand the whole project that
44:25 - you are working with
44:27 - so i usually do i most of the time i do
44:29 - from scratch
44:30 - yeah save that
44:32 - beautiful now instead of using mega
44:34 - color yellow i'm actually going to do a
44:35 - background color of the following which
44:36 - is a really interesting background color
44:38 - you guys might not know you guys can
44:40 - copy for yourself
44:41 - right here this one
44:43 - i'll place it for you here in the zoom
44:44 - chat
44:47 - and same thing is this one right here up
44:50 - that's the background color guys i want
44:52 - you guys to use
44:54 - okay beautiful
44:55 - after that background color is done the
44:58 - next thing is going to be here let me
45:00 - see here is going to be what well the
45:02 - margin let's give it a margin now let's
45:03 - give some spacing here
45:06 - or 50 pixels beautiful
45:09 - and remember who remembers you see how
45:11 - there's these edges how do we create the
45:14 - edges curved edges around this specific
45:16 - div anybody know
45:21 - anybody know
45:24 - who knows
45:26 - that's our border radius
45:31 - oh whatever it is and i'm going to say
45:33 - here six pixels okay
45:36 - save that hey right there beautiful
45:39 - next up
45:40 - right we have new the new to do let's
45:43 - now check on okay the actual check right
45:46 - the check so here
45:48 - so i'm gonna say dot check here
45:52 - okay
45:53 - and i'm going to give this dot check a
45:55 - what a
45:57 - let's see background color of yellow for
46:00 - now
46:02 - same thing always yellow yellow mellow
46:05 - there we go
46:06 - it's not sure enough because we need to
46:07 - give it a width so width let's just say
46:09 - of 70 pixels
46:11 - oh 70 pixels
46:15 - it's still not showing up for some
46:16 - reason why is that with this on your
46:17 - pixels
46:20 - let me see here
46:22 - inspect that element this one
46:28 - new to do we have the check mark all
46:30 - because there is no height on this check
46:32 - mark that's why so to create a height
46:35 - i'm actually going to use something
46:36 - called this flex play effects
46:39 - we never imported the pic which picture
46:41 - you guys talking about the picture we
46:43 - did i imported the picture from by

47:10 - use uh display flex so look if i put
47:12 - display flex on here um
47:16 - flex boom see display flex automatically
47:19 - uh makes make sure that the that um the
47:22 - div stretches full height

47:30 - a pro i always have problem with flexbox
47:32 - what to do
47:33 - keep practicing that's it just keep
47:36 - practicing and then you'll get better at
47:37 - it

48:17 - this new to do um actually hold on let
48:18 - me see here
48:19 - i'm going to focus now on the
48:22 - to do input right here

49:33 - right that will allow me
49:35 - to um
49:38 - look at the form here to actually
49:41 - go to the input
49:43 - and one make sure this input is actually
49:46 - centered so i'm gonna say display flex
49:47 - on this one
49:50 - okay
49:52 - and then i'm gonna say
49:53 - align items
49:57 - center
49:58 - beautiful
49:59 - nice nice nice nice nice
50:01 - and then
50:02 - i'm going to say hey for the input
50:05 - here
50:07 - i need to do input input hey input
50:11 - become width of a hundred percent
50:16 - now it's not there yet because why if
50:17 - you look at the form let me look at this
50:19 - here
50:21 - look at this guys you see we have the
50:22 - form the form is actually really small
50:24 - we need to make sure the form this is a
50:26 - full width right but the 4 needs to be
50:28 - full width of 100 as well so what i need
50:31 - to do as well is need to get make sure
50:32 - the form goes as well so as well do i'll
50:35 - say new to the input
50:37 - right here
50:39 - and i'll say form
50:41 - i'm gonna give this form a flex girl one
50:46 - beautiful just like that and now the
50:48 - form is stretching and as well as the
50:50 - input is stretching too guys right
50:53 - there you go now with the input what i'm
50:55 - going to do
50:58 - yes kyle you could use the same thing
50:59 - with the grid that's right
51:02 - okay
51:02 - with the input that's actually inside
51:04 - here that's where it gets a little bit
51:06 - complicated
51:07 - you know i hate the way the input works
51:08 - by default it's hideous as hell is what
51:12 - all i can tell you and so we're just
51:13 - going to we need to change that one we
51:15 - need to make this a lot better a lot
51:17 - better first things first for the input
51:19 - i'm going to give the padding why
51:20 - because you will see that the text is
51:22 - going to become bigger check this out
51:24 - padding and i will say here padding of
51:26 - 10 pixels meaning
51:27 - 10 pixels on the top and 10 pixels on
51:30 - the bottom and zero pixels on the left
51:32 - and on the right see right there the
51:34 - formulas became bigger just by adding
51:36 - how do you know the pixel number so well
51:39 - is that the cheat sheet
51:41 - so how do i know the pixel so well it's
51:44 - the cheat sheet guys
51:46 - right here
51:48 - so yeah it is a cheat sheet because um
51:51 - when i originally write this right when
51:53 - i originally write this um of course i
51:55 - play around with the pixels right i
51:58 - tried this right i tried that i tried
52:00 - this i tried that i tried
52:02 - multiple things and see which one works
52:04 - the best and i mean it takes me a second
52:07 - like two seconds
52:09 - why isn't the background totally
52:12 - why isn't the back background totally
52:13 - white the background should not be white
52:15 - are you saying why why is the background
52:17 - white because by default
52:19 - a input has a background of white and
52:20 - we're gonna change that

55:21 - which is so so important as well all
55:24 - right let's check
55:27 - right here now the checkmark is width of
55:29 - 70 pixels correct but of course inside
55:31 - there there's a check mark if you look
55:33 - at my initial html you see there's a
55:34 - check mark this is going to be the
55:36 - actual div that's going to circle right
55:38 - right
55:39 - so what
55:40 - doesn't good question so
55:42 - somebody asked the question oh what does
55:44 - the the two dots mean
55:46 - what does the two dots mean
55:48 - right so if i go back to my style the
55:50 - css
55:51 - what does the two dots mean well really
55:53 - all this means is there's no specific
55:55 - meaning all this is means is like
55:58 - grab the placeholder within the input
56:01 - right sometimes for example um
56:04 - uh what's it called there's many
56:05 - different things like before after
56:08 - sometimes we use two dots as a way to
56:10 - represent to get an attribute
56:12 - to target an attribute within
56:16 - the input okay so nothing crazy it's
56:19 - nothing crazy oh we got 200 likes guys
56:21 - let's get up let's get us to 300 likes
56:22 - on youtube that would be amazing
56:23 - appreciate that guys let me much
56:25 - appreciate it so go ahead guys click the
56:28 - like button and of course here's what i
56:29 - like to say
56:30 - if you're not happy right now and you
56:31 - want to be happy then click subscribe
56:33 - because if you click subscribe you'll be
56:34 - happy
56:36 - that's what i used to say so i like to
56:38 - say
56:46 - right so all right let's work on our
56:49 - check mark uh right here
56:52 - now the check mark itself is basically
56:54 - going to be that the round little circle
56:56 - thingy okay guys
56:59 - round i'm going to give you a width of
57:01 - 30 pixels again
57:03 - sam i know you're asking how my how do i
57:04 - know this pixel so well because as just
57:06 - you know i'm just so brilliant with this
57:08 - that's why i'm just kidding because i
57:10 - have a cheat
57:13 - um
57:15 - all right awesome
57:16 - the two dots indicate two classes yeah
57:19 - great so
57:21 - after that what we're going to do we're
57:22 - going to get a border radius of 30 or 50
57:25 - percent guys that's going to make it a
57:27 - perfect square
57:29 - you guys didn't know that
57:31 - you guys don't see it yet because we
57:32 - need to create the actual borders i'm
57:33 - going to say border
57:35 - actually
57:36 - remove this border for now let's say
57:38 - border here
57:39 - two pixels
57:40 - solid
57:42 - and this is the color right here so it's
57:43 - the color that was printed for us
57:47 - solid here's our color
57:49 - boom you see it's all the way where let
57:51 - me just let me move this
57:54 - it's all the way right

58:02 - guys can have it as well
58:05 - boom
58:11 - right there beautiful
58:13 - okay
58:14 - beautiful let me go ahead and take a
58:15 - look at this now
58:17 - oh let me see the code all right
58:20 - keep going here after we do the two
58:22 - picks of style you see how it's like
58:23 - it's not there i'm actually going to
58:25 - give the border 50 percent and so now
58:27 - it's it actually it's not it's still on
58:28 - the circle
58:30 - anybody know why it's still not a circle
58:32 - even though i give it a border high
58:34 - hello high and high knowledge how you
58:35 - doing so
58:37 - even if though it's not a perfect circle
58:39 - what i do
58:44 - no
58:45 - the reason why it's not abort 50 still
58:48 - because
58:49 - it's actually because
58:50 - of uh well
58:56 - oh because border radius
58:58 - go good catch guys
59:01 - there we go now it's a perfect circle
59:03 - whoops
59:09 - your check mark your check mark right
59:11 - here
59:12 - make sure you have a color for it my
59:13 - friend make sure you actually have the
59:14 - border
59:16 - make sure the board make sure you have
59:17 - this correctly guys there there's one
59:19 - thing you guys need to understand is
59:20 - that there's a lot of details or very
59:22 - specific details if you don't get your
59:24 - class correctly nothing will show up
59:28 - i'm actually you'll this check mark is
59:30 - inside the check right here
59:32 - you see that right there that's what you
59:34 - have to make sure it's working
59:36 - let's go back to our style of css all
59:38 - right
59:39 - in the check mark of course let's make
59:40 - sure this check mark is also a line
59:42 - centered as well all right that's very
59:44 - important so i'm going to say what i'm
59:45 - going to say display flex
59:48 - right here to flex it then i'm going to
59:53 - do
59:54 - justify content center
59:57 - right and then align item center to put
59:59 - it what in the center or vertically
60:03 - done so and look at this guys it's
60:05 - working just like this it's working it's
60:07 - beautiful it's so beautiful
60:09 - i believe i can fly i'm just kidding
60:12 - right so we got the check mark awesome
60:14 - suede
60:16 - um for
60:18 - and then now let me go ahead and i think
60:22 - yeah let's work on the check mark hover
60:24 - guys
60:26 - that check mark
60:27 - i'm gonna say on the hover and again
60:30 - this
60:30 - two
60:32 - colons whatever it's called right it's
60:34 - to specify the attribute of the actual
60:37 - class so the hover attribute of the
60:39 - class right
60:41 - i'm going to give number one i'm going
60:42 - to change the border color
60:44 - right here to linear gradient
60:46 - that's right look at this guys so if i
60:49 - hover this
60:50 - oh
60:51 - it's not working that's awesome
60:54 - okay i'm going to give the background of
60:57 - this
60:59 - let me see if this is working now
61:02 - oh look look at this look at this this
61:04 - is beautiful this is awesome this backup
61:07 - color so that's an awesome background
61:09 - color
61:10 - all right so actually you can't really
61:12 - do background colors like these so i'm
61:14 - actually going to delete these that's
61:15 - not necessary you actually cannot change
61:17 - the background color off a border or to
61:20 - linear gradient that's not possible
61:21 - unfortunately
61:22 - so we cannot do that one all right
61:25 - but what i however can do is well we got
61:28 - this let's change this check mark to be
61:30 - a cursor pointer so we feel like it's an
61:33 - actual pointer
61:35 - beautiful
61:36 - all right let me see here hey let's go
61:39 - beautiful
61:40 - and i'm going to give this small
61:41 - transition okay guys so a transition to
61:43 - make it feel like it's just uh very
61:45 - smooth right so for the check mark
61:48 - i will say transition
61:50 - all and i will give it a 0.25
61:54 - seconds and just to give you a small
61:55 - little tidbit
61:57 - yes i can place this for you guys don't
61:59 - worry so i can give you a small tidbit
62:01 - guys here um really cool
62:04 - 0.25 seconds is actually really good
62:06 - standard for like a real nice transition
62:08 - so there's 0.3 0.25 um
62:11 - i think anything above that is like does
62:13 - not really feel good to a user right so
62:16 - i would say 0.25 seconds is the best the
62:19 - best way to do it to go about it
62:20 - all right
62:22 - let me say can i can i do this yes i'm
62:24 - gonna give you the linear gradient no
62:25 - problem
62:27 - here's the linear gradient so you guys
62:29 - can see it
62:31 - right because some of you guys asked
62:32 - about the linear gradient well here you
62:33 - go
62:35 - right there
62:37 - okay we got that one oh what someone's
62:39 - calling me
62:42 - that's not cool
62:43 - it's not cool
62:45 - all right
62:46 - so guys guys look look we have our new
62:48 - to do item it's right there it's working

63:43 - crypto.js and the the one thing i want
63:45 - to create now is going to be well
63:47 - um we want to have a functionality
63:50 - whereby we add item right when we hit
63:53 - this right when we hit enter we are
63:56 - adding a new item so that's going to
63:58 - create a function called add item so i'm
64:00 - going to say function here i'm going to
64:02 - say add item
64:05 - right and nothing inside here so far
64:08 - oh it's not interesting
64:11 - and inside this add item of course what
64:14 - do we need to do to add this item well
64:16 - one let's actually call this function
64:18 - when we hit submit so a few things need
64:20 - to happen
64:21 - if i go to my insta html if i go to my
64:23 - form
64:24 - there's a really cool attribute called
64:26 - unsubmit
64:27 - you see this right on submit
64:30 - so on the submit of the form i'm
64:32 - actually going to call a function called
64:34 - add item right here check this out
64:37 - right look at this add item and that's
64:40 - it so this is the function i'm going to
64:42 - call on the submit right here okay guys
64:45 - beautiful now inside here i'm going to
64:47 - say console.log
64:50 - dialogue
64:53 - add item
64:55 - right here
64:57 - okay
65:00 - click console
65:01 - if i go ahead and if i type something in
65:03 - here guys for this out
65:05 - oh you see it went there and disappeared
65:07 - so let me let me try this again okay
65:08 - guys check this out
65:11 - enter disappeared why is that the case
65:13 - anybody know
65:15 - anybody guess why it's showing and
65:17 - disappearing well if i go ahead and
65:18 - preserve the log here guys if i preserve
65:20 - the lock which will make sure to we'll
65:22 - keep track of all the log no matter what
65:23 - happens look at this
65:26 - hello
65:27 - and enter
65:28 - boom see an item
65:30 - but then what happened guys is that it
65:32 - navigated back to the index.html
65:36 - why is that can anybody tell me
65:40 - why is that can you switch to javascript
65:42 - back for a second okay hold on
65:46 - but anybody know why this is the case
65:48 - why did it all automatically refresh the
65:50 - whole page
65:55 - [Music]
65:57 - that's right asada because by default
65:59 - guys by default
66:01 - a form on submit section is going to
66:03 - refresh the page by default
66:06 - form is going to want to take you to a
66:08 - new page that's been something that's
66:10 - been in html for the longest time now i
66:14 - hate the way it is
66:16 - everybody hates it
66:17 - but it's okay
66:18 - what we what we can do is we can
66:20 - actually pass in the whole event which
66:22 - was submitted to us all right
66:24 - i want to show you something check this
66:25 - out if i go to my script.js i pass in
66:28 - the event and i call the event right
66:30 - here
66:32 - save the event right
66:34 - right here i can solo the event
66:38 - save that
66:40 - inspect element i want you to show this
66:42 - to this out
66:43 - okay
66:44 - hit hello
66:47 - hit enter boom
66:49 - this is the submit event so when you
66:50 - submit and i pass in the actual event
66:52 - from my enter oh it was actually going
66:54 - to show me
66:56 - come on oh it's not shown because it
66:58 - refreshed again so what happens is
67:00 - basically it's it's an actual event that
67:01 - we pass in
67:03 - now what you can do is you can actually
67:04 - call it a event that prevent
67:07 - default
67:10 - why are we doing this because by default
67:13 - the form will re refresh your page and
67:16 - we want it to stop from reloading the
67:18 - page that's right khalid that's right
67:21 - martin that's correct
67:23 - save that
67:25 - pom pom
67:28 - inspect them on this one

67:50 - default right there okay good save it
67:52 - again one last time guys
67:57 - console
67:58 - hello
68:00 - hey let's go
68:04 - dashed in jaya script i'm not sure why
68:06 - it's dashed so you can see this is the
68:08 - event that we press in really enough
68:10 - look at this guys you can see this event
68:12 - has a lot of different stuff you can see
68:13 - here is it's talking hey the path that
68:16 - was it was clicked you can see this is
68:17 - the path that was clicked on
68:19 - see there's the path that was clicked on
68:21 - we know that we know the source element
68:23 - there's a lot that it's given to us
68:25 - right but we don't actually need this
68:26 - specific event our goal is just simply
68:28 - prevented it from refreshing which is
68:29 - not doing anymore
68:31 - once we've run the default let's
68:33 - actually let us do the following thing
68:35 - let's actually go ahead

81:32 - and i know the people i'm looking at
81:35 - okay make sure you have your copy but
81:38 - see this is why formatting is so
81:39 - important guys this div is the closing
81:41 - deck for this deal is this one
81:44 - right here it's like you closing your
81:46 - box you have to open the box and then
81:48 - you have to close the box right somehow
81:50 - like if you close the box or you use a
81:52 - different lid to close the box it's it's
81:54 - that's not the correct lid
82:00 - that's right so make sure you have the
82:01 - right box

82:14 - but now start and dips well okay
82:16 - somebody said any any techniques to find
82:18 - out starting end as well uh one is look
82:21 - at this make sure one you have a
82:22 - prettier to make sure it's aligned
82:24 - properly two is you can use something
82:25 - called called a prettier here let me see

82:40 - pretty
82:42 - oh there we go bracket pair color right
82:45 - so you guys can install this one
82:46 - the bracket per colorizer that was
82:49 - actually it will actually color the
82:50 - things for you so that could actually be
82:52 - very very helpful for you honestly
82:54 - yeah uh it's like it could be really
82:56 - cool too
82:57 - yeah right rainbow brackets or black and
82:59 - pink colorizer whichever one you want to
83:01 - use
83:03 - i'll just keep it simple guys just keep
83:06 - it simple
83:08 - okay
83:10 - beautiful
83:11 - so we've got our to-do items of course
83:13 - let's go ahead and add our cursor
83:15 - pointer here so let's go to style of css
83:17 - the next thing i want to do is the
83:18 - following which is going to be
83:21 - i want to add the border radius to our
83:23 - to do items wrapper so same thing border
83:26 - radius
83:28 - just how did the last time
83:30 - for this one
83:32 - it's gonna be what anybody remember it's
83:35 - gonna be six pixels
83:38 - save that beautiful say that border
83:40 - radius six pixels
83:42 - and there we go but of course it's still
83:44 - bit weird you see how this thing is a
83:46 - bit awkward this is awkward too well i
83:48 - can fix that by just simply saying
83:50 - overflow
83:52 - hidden
83:55 - hidden
83:56 - done
83:57 - simply and done done done done done next
84:00 - up okay i'm now going to give a small
84:03 - black shadow to make it look just dope
84:07 - small black shadow it's going to look
84:09 - like this
84:11 - right here here's my box shadow save it
84:14 - let's make it look it it will make it
84:16 - look like it's popping out of the screen
84:18 - here's your box i'm gonna give it to
84:20 - everybody in the zoom chat and if you're
84:22 - in the youtubes i'll give it to you on
84:24 - the youtube store don't worry i got you
84:25 - guys
84:29 - don't worry
84:30 - all right
84:32 - so
84:33 - let's continue
84:36 - actually that we got
84:37 - all right the youtubes are good
84:39 - all right the next thing is going to be
84:41 - the hover effect i want to focus on the
84:43 - hover effect now for this portion okay
84:48 - um if you're gonna spam on the youtube i
84:50 - will throw you out sorry
84:54 - hi user uh
84:57 - sorry that's just how it is okay
85:00 - all right so let's work on the hover
85:02 - effect of this specific you know um
85:05 - you know not the check mark but the
85:07 - actual
85:08 - um
85:10 - the on to do item hover so
85:13 - i want to work on this one where's my
85:14 - hover my hover effect to do that uh i
85:17 - will say hey you know what
85:19 - on the hover
85:23 - on the hover to do item let me look at
85:25 - this here
85:26 - so to do item here
85:28 - dot to do item
85:30 - i'm gonna say hover
85:32 - okay
85:33 - what do we want to change in the hover
85:35 - if you look at our original original
85:36 - item right here you can see it's like it
85:38 - feels like it's like a popping out of
85:40 - the screen
85:42 - it feels like it's popping out of the
85:43 - screen so the way we actually do that
85:45 - it's a really cool um strategy that i
85:47 - like to use personally
85:49 - all you're doing guys is one we're
85:51 - adding a small box shadow and two
85:54 - you're lifting the actual uh three like
85:57 - two pixels up
85:58 - that's it so
86:00 - check this out
86:02 - on the hover one i'm going to translate
86:04 - it
86:05 - two pixels up so basically this right
86:07 - here means hey
86:09 - vertically i'm going to push the full on
86:11 - div
86:12 - two pixels up that's what that means
86:14 - okay that's just transform after that
86:17 - i'm going to get a box shadow
86:22 - right here
86:25 - and i'm going to give you guys a box
86:26 - shadow as well don't worry i got you
86:28 - guys i got you
86:30 - boom
86:31 - i got you guys i'm not gonna let you
86:33 - guys to get stranded don't worry
86:34 - always i'm going to change the border
86:37 - color
86:38 - from this uh this one to actually this
86:41 - one
86:43 - to a black border color so on the hopper
86:45 - check this out on the hover
86:46 - wait now that's the correct one
86:48 - oh look at that look at this look at
86:51 - this look at this everybody look at that
86:53 - now a few things i want to take care of
86:55 - first right so let's go ahead and number
86:57 - one use a transition which is really
86:59 - important and we can always do that so
87:03 - i'm here here style the css
87:09 - [Music]
87:13 - okay
87:14 - careful
87:16 - we get a small transition
87:18 - with a
87:21 - like this on a transition here
87:24 - i'm gonna say transition
87:26 - transition
87:29 - transition
87:30 - good
87:31 - i'm gonna say all
87:33 - for now
87:35 - 0.25 seconds
87:37 - but
87:39 - i want to say ease
87:41 - yes
87:42 - save that
87:44 - let's see here oh
87:46 - look at this
87:47 - beautiful
87:50 - look at that look at look at that look
87:52 - at look at this guys look at this it's
87:53 - so good now one thing i do want to make
87:55 - sure you see how i want to make sure
87:56 - that the z index this one actually goes
87:58 - overlays on top of it so don't worry i
88:00 - will actually make this one display flex
88:02 - and that will overlay it on top of it
88:03 - display flex
88:06 - you'll see what i mean
88:08 - ah i guess not that's okay i'll make it
88:10 - a z index in that case
88:14 - um
88:17 - the index one but on the hover i'm going
88:19 - to give it a z index of 10
88:23 - of 10. let me see this will work
88:27 - no not yet
88:31 - why is it not going above it that's so
88:32 - weird interesting display flex border
88:35 - cursor pointer
88:37 - that's cool let's put into cursor
88:39 - pointer now
88:42 - okay well i'll fix the neck is later
88:44 - with you guys don't worry
88:47 - how do we decide where to put the
88:48 - transition the transition uh
88:51 - how you decide to produce a well that
88:52 - one is pretty much you decide where to
88:54 - put the transition based on the item so
88:57 - for example we're trying to listen to do
88:59 - item right which is this box right here
89:01 - right so i'm going to put the transition
89:03 - on this portion right here that's it
89:05 - right
89:06 - i think um let me transition this one so
89:09 - transition all
89:11 - but i'm going to change the transition
89:12 - property maybe let me see here
89:15 - this one
89:17 - no still not
89:20 - it's not that's so interesting i'm not
89:21 - sure why that's the case
89:24 - the hover effect is not working the way
89:26 - i want it to work
89:28 - the border bottom is there
89:31 - okay
89:35 - i'm not sure why
89:37 - maybe the index of minus one
89:41 - you see that
89:43 - no still no really
89:46 - that's so weird
89:47 - okay well it's okay we can figure it out
89:49 - as we continue on it's okay
89:51 - right
89:53 - from to-do items that's right okay so we
89:55 - got that portion the next portion i want

92:49 - of 100
92:52 - okay
92:54 - sunny pixels after that i'm going to say
92:57 - hey you know what uh
92:58 - let's give it a different color here so
93:00 - color of the actual text should be a
93:02 - little bit different here
93:08 - sam is like man looks better than mine
93:13 - if something's wrong it's probably
93:14 - because your div is not correctly closed
93:16 - you might not have the right closing tag
93:17 - if it's not right
93:19 - okay awesome and then of course we need
93:22 - to put them from left to right so what
93:23 - do we do that guys remember that what do
93:25 - we put something from left to right what
93:26 - do we do here
93:28 - to put something from left to right we
93:33 - we do we flex it that's right so just
93:35 - display
93:37 - flex
93:38 - beautiful that's it right but of course
93:41 - i want to do a little bit differently so
93:42 - i'm going to space these things out so
93:43 - five items i want to make sure there's
93:45 - correct space between them so i'm going
93:46 - to say justify content what
93:48 - space between done so look at that right
93:51 - beautiful
93:52 - okay next one i'm going to give a
93:55 - padding
93:56 - a padding like this and say padding
93:58 - top and bottom is going to be 0 and then
94:00 - left and right is going to be 30 pixels
94:02 - both
94:04 - boom
94:05 - done so okay
94:06 - done so
94:08 - after that let's go ahead and uh put
94:10 - them in a sentence i'm gonna say align
94:12 - items
94:13 - center
94:15 - and my friends that's pretty much it
94:18 - that's it i see that's it so look look
94:20 - we did now of course we're not done yet
94:21 - fully i wanna check now on the statuses
94:24 - portion so
94:26 - well let's look at the status this
94:27 - portion said that item
94:30 - that
94:30 - statuses
94:32 - right here okay and here i want to say
94:34 - display uh flex of course
94:38 - flex
94:39 - i'm gonna say just if i cut center
94:42 - boom
94:43 - just as always centers and then i'm
94:45 - going to change the actual colors of the
94:46 - span so here
94:48 - for
94:49 - [Music]
94:51 - i'm going to give it some kind of a
94:52 - padding here so item statuses
94:55 - span tag
94:57 - i'm going to give it a padding
95:01 - of zero for top and bottom
95:04 - okay
95:06 - i'll have to
95:07 - oh good hope oh everything's okay lamont
95:10 - tap the bottom of zero and then uh left
95:13 - and right is going to be what four
95:14 - pixels
95:16 - save that okay that's going to give that
95:18 - span for that item
95:24 - let me see it's not doing it right now
95:27 - nope so item
95:32 - stat assistant did i spell it right
95:33 - items oh items their statuses
95:37 - it's items their statuses
95:41 - there we go nice
95:43 - so panning zero i'm going to give it a
95:46 - not four but maybe five pixels yeah so
95:48 - there we go that works too and i'm going
95:49 - to give the cursor pointer
95:52 - save that so that way when i hover over
95:54 - this it becomes feels like a button
95:56 - but of course we can make it even better
95:58 - because
95:59 - on the hover of the aesthetic system say
96:01 - items
96:03 - the items
96:05 - there's that this is
96:08 - on the hover of this section
96:10 - i will change the color of it as well
96:15 - that's right the color which is this one
96:17 - i'm going to give you guys the color
96:18 - right now
96:22 - here's the color those are you on
96:24 - youtube here's the color right here as
96:25 - well boom janjo
96:28 - okay we got the color so now if i go and
96:30 - have a
96:31 - oh dang i just um no
96:33 - that's not right so it should be item
96:35 - statuses
96:36 - span hover not the whole thing hover so
96:39 - go one by one you see now it's one by
96:40 - one that's it it makes it very easy and
96:42 - of course we also need to make sure
96:44 - there's an active one so if i if i
96:46 - select one i need to give an active in
96:49 - maybe css class for example so for
96:51 - example maybe this span has a class here
96:54 - of active
96:58 - active that's the one we clicked on
97:00 - right so
97:01 - the same thing is going to happen here
97:04 - fallacy says i'm going to say the comma
97:08 - item statuses
97:11 - span dot active
97:14 - i know it's right spend that
97:20 - that's right active also same thing so
97:22 - you see now the all becomes the active
97:24 - one
97:25 - and the last thing i'm going to do is
97:28 - also target this clear completed as well
97:29 - so let me go ahead and do this right now
97:31 - so let's go to target this declare
97:33 - completed portion
97:35 - right here
97:37 - this item's clear
97:43 - items clear i'm going to give this one a
97:46 - what a
97:47 - cursor pointer as well
97:50 - okay
97:52 - cursor pointer and then i'm gonna give
97:54 - it a text align end so that it's always
97:56 - at the end of of everything
97:59 - so it's always pushed to the right hand
98:01 - side
98:02 - okay like this always push to here
98:04 - that's why i give it text on my end and
98:06 - also on the hover of this i also want to
98:08 - make sure that the color changes too so
98:11 - i'm going to say
98:12 - comma
98:13 - items
98:16 - if you guys didn't know but comma is a
98:18 - way for us to apply the same style to
98:20 - multiple things
98:22 - clear
98:24 - hover
98:26 - let's see it
98:27 - boom done
98:29 - that's it look at this
98:30 - done done done done done done done
98:33 - that's it guys
98:34 - we've got our uh i mean application is
98:37 - not done fully because we need to get
98:38 - the javascript to it fully
98:40 - but look
98:41 - that's pretty cool wouldn't you say so
98:45 - i would say so it's pretty awesome
98:46 - we've got a really amazing looking
98:49 - application of course that's not fully
98:50 - working just yet but that's okay we can
98:52 - we can fix it that's okay we can fix it
98:54 - we can make sure we can make sure it's
98:56 - uh not you know differently
98:58 - right
98:59 - and that's it
99:02 - oh let me see why is it that i need to
99:04 - do hover that still does not work the
99:06 - way i want it to be
99:08 - this one works properly
99:12 - but this one does not why is that
99:23 - i'm trying to understand why is it that
99:25 - my to-do item is not looking the same
99:27 - way that it should be
99:30 - as before here
99:33 - oh i think because maybe it's the
99:35 - background color
99:37 - you see
99:38 - here
99:40 - let me see here
99:43 - oh
99:44 - that's why because oh there we go that's
99:47 - why because
99:48 - by default this background color is
99:50 - transparent so i need to set the
99:52 - background color on the to-do item to
99:53 - make sure that when i hover over this
99:55 - you see now it covers everything else
99:57 - that makes sense so much more this way
99:59 - you don't need this this is horrible the
100:00 - index portion right now
100:02 - right here
100:05 - that's right yeah i'm really curious
100:07 - yeah yeah because again that's what's
100:08 - going on right is when i hover over this
100:10 - it's gonna translate it two pieces up
100:13 - but what happened is the background
100:14 - color was transparent initially and so
100:16 - it kind of looked like this you see
100:18 - when i hover over this you see the
100:20 - little white uh border from the top uh
100:23 - to do item still appears you guys see
100:25 - that yes or no right
100:27 - so to remove that all i do is just
100:29 - simply put a background color on the
100:31 - whole thing and so now it looks like
100:32 - this
100:33 - that's it guys
100:34 - all right so that my friends is pretty
100:36 - much done now let's work on the actual
100:38 - javascript portion yeah
100:41 - yeah the pro vacuum brush is cool right
100:43 - it's really cool so look here's what we
100:44 - got so far guys
100:46 - oh
100:46 - that looks sexy
100:48 - yeah that looks amazing
100:50 - i like it
100:51 - now let's work on the
100:54 - the firebase that's right
101:01 - yes
101:05 - okay i am ready my friends

103:38 - this so want to create that account
103:42 - okay you click on this one
103:44 - click on the web portion click on web
103:47 - and then let's create it let's register
103:48 - our app i'm gonna say to do
103:50 - live beautiful
103:53 - click register app
104:00 - all right so here's what we got
104:05 - this is a lot so
104:06 - the first thing to do is copy and paste
104:09 - all of this script stuff
104:12 - these script tags you see these
104:16 - copy and paste this is your script app
104:18 - so you want to copy this portion
104:21 - yes firebase is free by the way
104:24 - let's go to back to any html and then
104:26 - let's go ahead and make sure you put it
104:28 - before script.js okay everybody but
104:31 - before
104:32 - script.js
104:34 - boom done
104:37 - let me remove this i don't need this at
104:38 - all
104:41 - it's right here
104:42 - so now we have a firebase app we have
104:44 - we're importing the firebase app right
104:47 - here firebase analytics right here
104:49 - that's looking pretty good okay
104:52 - and then what you want to do is copy
104:54 - this portion to this config so i'm going
104:56 - to copy this config like this
104:59 - command c config you should have your
105:00 - own config guys
105:02 - okay
105:03 - command c the config portion
105:06 - command c
105:08 - and then command command save this
105:11 - let's create a new file called
105:12 - firebase.js
105:16 - dot gs this will be your configuration
105:19 - file boom paste it into here
105:25 - can i paste those here so i mean
105:27 - i can do this for you but i don't want
105:29 - anybody messing with this one so you
105:31 - guys should create your own config if
105:32 - you do if you want to use my config here
105:35 - using effect which is this one
105:39 - it's in the actual store guys here just
105:42 - use this one can thick guys
105:48 - right here
105:50 - luca says config without the script tags
105:53 - yes well we're putting the yes that's
105:55 - correct yes lucas can think without the
105:57 - script tags so when we do this right now
105:59 - right there
106:00 - right
106:01 - forget the script text because the
106:03 - script tags is for us to write inside
106:05 - inside the script the javascript file
106:07 - remember when we create the fibo.gs we
106:09 - are already inside the javascript file
106:11 - so we don't need to do not need to put
106:12 - script tags around it that's the thing
106:15 - okay that's why we do not need the
106:17 - script text
106:18 - all right so we've got the configuration
106:20 - file all is good there
106:23 - save that click on continue go to
106:26 - console
106:29 - and that's it
106:30 - now
106:32 - the next one we're going to work on is
106:33 - called the real-time firestore database
106:35 - click on the firestore database
106:38 - click on create database
106:40 - start in test mode
106:42 - click next
106:44 - enable
106:46 - and
106:48 - so remember test mode enable test mode
106:51 - enable test mode put into test mode and
106:53 - click enable
106:55 - let me see here
106:56 - provisioning cloud firestore let's see
106:59 - if it works
107:04 - nice
107:05 - click on
107:06 - start your first collection
107:09 - and we're gonna say to do
107:11 - dash items
107:14 - now collection is a database guys a
107:16 - collection is a table right of items
107:18 - right that is what collection is so if
107:21 - you want to store something like a list
107:23 - of for example to do items right your
107:26 - collection is the what's going to store
107:28 - those to do items so for example
107:30 - to do items is that one big collection
107:32 - but inside the collection we have
107:34 - individual items so inside here i'm
107:36 - going to create a visual item i'm going
107:37 - to give it a document id you guys can
107:40 - see it's auto generated by um you know
107:42 - firebase itself
107:44 - and i'm going to say the text
107:47 - for this one is going to be
107:49 - cut the lawn i don't know why catalan is
107:51 - still the top one for me cut the law and
107:53 - say status
107:54 - is going to be active why
107:57 - because if you look at our to-do list
107:59 - app
108:00 - okay you can see it says active
108:02 - completed there's two statuses active
108:04 - and completed
108:07 - so same thing here active
108:09 - save
108:11 - and so now we have our collection here
108:14 - right there and now we have one of our
108:16 - first document our first data document
108:18 - inside our collection the to do items
108:21 - all right beautiful
108:23 - now to actually get this data we're not
108:26 - done yet guys we need to go and figure
108:28 - out how do we configure firestore some
108:29 - say uh firestore firestore
108:33 - firestore
108:35 - get started
108:37 - okay
108:39 - firestore gets started i'm going to go
108:42 - down and here's what you need so the one
108:44 - thing we're missing here is the actual
108:45 - firestore
108:47 - uh you know uh code so i'm going to copy
108:50 - this fire's firebase firestore code
108:52 - command c
108:53 - and i'll give you guys the actual code
108:55 - here
108:56 - boom
108:58 - and then
108:59 - boom right here
109:01 - you're going to copy this script tag and
109:04 - you're going to put it inside index.html
109:07 - hit enter
109:09 - put it inside after the analytics one
109:12 - you see this one analytics portion put
109:14 - it after
109:16 - that
109:18 - that's it
109:19 - okay
109:20 - after all of this what you want to do is
109:22 - you want to
109:24 - import the firebase.js so we'll say
109:27 - script source
109:29 - right here
109:30 - firebase.js okay the configuration file
109:32 - for firebase does that make sense
109:36 - that's correct khalid firebase
109:38 - collections is kind of like a mongodb
109:40 - collections that's correct yes you're
109:42 - right on that one you're right
109:44 - okay so we got the portion command save
109:46 - on this one and then the last thing we
109:48 - need to do is if we scroll down you see
109:50 - we need to initialize the firebase
109:52 - firestore
109:54 - right here
109:55 - and that's why the firebase firestore
109:57 - it's as simple as that
109:58 - so i'm going to say vardb
110:00 - i'm going to go back to my
110:01 - wirefirebase.js
110:03 - and boom
110:04 - now i have initialized it and because i
110:06 - initialize it with adb that means i can
110:08 - access it anywhere inside my
110:10 - application
110:12 - make sense
110:14 - okay we got that
110:15 - save that now that's all good
110:18 - next up
110:20 - what are we going to do well the one
110:23 - thing i do want to do is you see now we
110:25 - have all the data to add this let's
110:26 - actually create the functionality to add
110:28 - our to-do item to the database so let's
110:31 - try it out
110:32 - okay
110:33 - so i'm going to insert the add item
110:35 - functionality
110:38 - let's go to script.js
110:40 - inside here this is our ad item
110:42 - functionality
110:44 - i'm going to what
110:46 - do the following i'm going to say okay
110:48 - to add something into the into the
110:50 - database here's what we've got to do
110:54 - db.collection add you see
110:57 - collection is the collection we created
110:58 - and then here's the data we want to add
111:00 - just simple as that honestly
111:03 - oh let me move this to here
111:06 - let's try it out
111:07 - let's try that together
111:09 - so i'm gonna say here
111:11 - db.collection
111:14 - collection
111:15 - the collection that we created which
111:16 - what is the collection guys we created
111:17 - anybody know
111:20 - what is the collection we create anybody
111:21 - remember that one what is the collection
111:23 - that we created anybody remember this
111:24 - one
111:25 - what is the collection that we created
111:28 - who remembers
111:30 - that's right to do items so to do items
111:34 - to do dash items
111:38 - okay beautiful save that one of course
111:40 - and then after that one uh let me go
111:43 - ahead and make sure it's all good
111:45 - after that one we do what to do items
111:48 - and we say dot add
111:51 - same thing dot add
111:53 - right here
111:54 - and we add ourselves an object okay
111:58 - an object okay and this object has a few
112:00 - things one we have the text value
112:02 - i have the status value so text
112:05 - right here and where do we get the text
112:07 - does anybody know
112:09 - that's right retro db is for database
112:11 - where we got db is because remember
112:14 - we initialize the db here you see
112:17 - firebase firestore it's inside here so
112:18 - if i kill that
112:20 - database if i set this database then
112:23 - this would be
112:26 - data
112:27 - base
112:29 - see that but we call it db for short
112:33 - db
112:35 - boom done
112:39 - does that make sense retro
112:41 - so text what text are we adding to this
112:44 - one we're adding the what
112:46 - text we're getting the input but we're
112:48 - doing text
112:50 - that value to get the actual value of
112:52 - the text and then we say status by
112:54 - default the status that we set when we
112:56 - add a new item is what active
113:02 - that's the default text and then once we
113:04 - go ahead and add this in
113:06 - so let's go ahead and save it and let's
113:08 - go ahead and actually try it out so
113:09 - let's save this okay everybody ready for
113:11 - this are you guys ready are you ready
113:14 - let's go
113:15 - let's go let's try it out okay so it's
113:17 - ready
113:18 - so
113:19 - let's add for example like i'm going to
113:24 - go to the gym
113:26 - okay
113:29 - oh i want go to the gym
113:32 - i'm going to hit enter and my expedition
113:34 - is to see this inside here
113:36 - inside here somewhere
113:38 - are you ready for this okay let's go
113:40 - back to my here
113:42 - hit enter
113:44 - and where'd it go oh
113:47 - [Laughter]
113:48 - go to the gym
113:50 - is indeed right here my friends it is
113:54 - here look at this guys boom boom boom
113:58 - boom boom boom boom that's exactly what
114:00 - we want to do you see
114:03 - just like that okay after
114:05 - now of course you see how i hit enter
114:07 - but this did not clear where to do that
114:09 - i'm gonna say now textile value
114:12 - is equal to nothing
114:15 - that's right
114:16 - so now if i try this again so i'm
114:18 - resetting the actual value inside this
114:19 - input box i'm gonna say okay go now go
114:23 - to the market
114:26 - and enter boom we see disappears and
114:29 - then inside our database
114:32 - jim we'll go to the market and then
114:34 - catalon
114:35 - it's working everybody it is working
114:40 - somebody said kelly said i'm going to
114:42 - flex to the css gym that's right
114:46 - that's funny so there you go my friends
114:48 - that's how we properly do it
114:51 - okay
114:53 - next up of course
114:55 - let's go ahead and now work on the next
114:57 - portion which i'm going to focus on is
114:59 - actually getting this data right here
115:01 - cutting the lawn whatever is in the
115:02 - database
115:03 - so what i'm going to do is scroll and
115:06 - create a function called function
115:09 - function called
115:10 - get items
115:13 - okay
115:15 - it's called get
115:16 - items
115:18 - all right
115:19 - let's get these items
115:21 - this is going to be a little not more
115:23 - difficult guys okay
115:24 - this is a little bit more complicated
115:26 - guys now okay get items now
115:29 - to get the items what we're going to do
115:30 - is we're going to use db
115:33 - and again if you go back to the database
115:35 - uh thing
115:37 - every data you see
115:38 - that get done but the way we get it is a
115:41 - little different we're going to use a
115:42 - real-time database getter function it's
115:45 - called db dot collection
115:49 - what collection are we working with
115:50 - anybody know somebody tell me
115:52 - what collection you're working with
115:54 - zoom people zoom let's go what are you
115:57 - working with
116:00 - to
116:01 - what
116:02 - to do what
116:04 - anybody
116:05 - to do items that's right
116:10 - two items okay
116:12 - all right two items and then after that
116:14 - one we're gonna use the code on snapshot
116:16 - guys so this out it's called on snapshot
116:21 - boom
116:22 - so
116:24 - a snapshot is a picture of a database
116:26 - it's like basically you're taking a
116:27 - picture right now and then you gain the
116:29 - current data okay that's inside the
116:30 - database that's what we call on snapshot
116:34 - well on snapchat is so
116:36 - powerful is because
116:38 - on snapchat is actually going to send us
116:40 - the data you know whenever we update
116:44 - something that's a really cool part
116:46 - about it so whenever something inside
116:48 - our database updates this will get
116:50 - called inside here
116:52 - it's it's using something called a uh
116:54 - what's called not a web hook but it's
116:56 - using something called a socket
116:58 - you guys did not know that
117:00 - close it out
117:02 - also double up socket and i can even
117:03 - give you guys if you guys are on zoom i
117:05 - can give you guys the actual code if you
117:06 - guys are interested
117:08 - boom here it is okay
117:10 - inside that i'm actually going to loop
117:12 - through the snapshot so let's go and see
117:14 - and what we got here so i'm going to say
117:15 - console.log
117:18 - the log snapshot
117:22 - that's right that's correct my ul is
117:25 - this the current state of the database
117:27 - so let's go ahead and i'll log snapshot
117:29 - let's see what we get of course i need
117:30 - to call this function now called get
117:31 - items
117:33 - at the bottom
117:40 - okay
117:42 - let's see inspect down on this one
117:45 - console
117:47 - console hey look at this
117:49 - uh yeah looks weird huh
117:51 - but look at this you see we have an
117:53 - array of three items you see this
117:55 - array of three right
117:57 - so you have docs
117:59 - right here that that's what we're doing
118:00 - here so to actually get this these docs
118:04 - that's the items that we get from a
118:05 - database here's what we'll do we'll say
118:07 - the following snapshot.docs
118:10 - dot docs
118:14 - now for each we're going to loot through
118:15 - every single document dot four each
118:18 - oops not like this for each
118:21 - like this
118:23 - and for every single dog
118:27 - we'll do something with it we'll say
118:29 - okay well we're gonna push the these uh
118:32 - array of items into uh the database or
118:35 - two into an array because we need to get
118:37 - the data so we'll say let items
118:40 - is equal to an array guys
118:44 - and then i'm gonna push the dock into
118:46 - the rate but but we'll do different
118:47 - we'll say items
118:48 - dot push
118:50 - to get the data we'll push the what doc
118:53 - look at this doc dot
118:55 - data
118:58 - you see that dot data so let me show you
119:01 - exactly what's going to happen now in
119:02 - this case okay
119:04 - let me exactly show you what's going to
119:05 - happen here so
119:06 - as we loop through everything
119:08 - i'm going to now console log
119:10 - the items
119:15 - check this out
119:16 - inspect downline this one
119:21 - oh
119:22 - let's go we got three items coming
119:24 - directly from a database
119:28 - hey that's what i'm talking about guys
119:30 - right
119:31 - directly from a database that's amazing
119:34 - okay i'm loving it but the one thing we
119:36 - don't have is the id you see what i want
119:38 - to do is i want to get the id of these
119:41 - elements of every single element which
119:44 - is unique id because when i click on
119:46 - when i want to click on this
119:48 - i should be able to mark you know
119:51 - for me to mark something completed i
119:53 - need to get the unique id
119:55 - of that little thing so here's what i'll
119:57 - do
119:59 - i'm going to do the following
120:01 - i'm going to say like this i'm going to
120:02 - say i'm going to create going to create
120:03 - an object
120:06 - and then i'm going to say id
120:08 - and the way to to get the id is called
120:10 - doc dot id
120:13 - comma
120:14 - and i will do this
120:15 - dot dot dot data so
120:18 - uh maybe a little more complicated than
120:20 - usually
120:21 - but this is called uh a what is it
120:24 - called i forgot i forgot it's the uh
120:27 - it's called an operator it's called
120:29 - transformative operator
120:31 - separation operator
120:33 - i forgot what it's called if you guys
120:35 - uh sp thank you it's called a spread
120:37 - operator i forgot came out of my mind
120:39 - it's called a spread operator basically
120:41 - it's like
120:42 - it's like imagine this it's like if you
120:44 - have a present
120:46 - okay
120:47 - and the present is the data
120:49 - what's inside the present is the data
120:51 - what you're doing is you're literally
120:53 - unwrapping the present
120:55 - right and imagine let's just say imagine
120:57 - the president has small gifts inside of
120:59 - that you know inside the big gift
121:01 - what you're doing when you're using a
121:03 - spread operator is that you're taking a
121:04 - small gift outside that big gift and
121:07 - you're just handing out to people right
121:10 - in my case i'm taking out the data from
121:13 - the doctor data i'm spreading it out
121:16 - to
121:17 - the actual object
121:19 - that's right it's called a spread
121:21 - operator okay
121:24 - okay and so now if i save this if i
121:26 - right click and split them on this one
121:27 - again
121:31 - oh we've got the id the active the text
121:35 - beautiful exactly what we want guys
121:37 - exactly we want
121:39 - okay
121:40 - so now
121:41 - we've got the data what do we do with
121:43 - that data how do we showcase the data
121:44 - here inside here that's the interesting
121:46 - part huh that's the hard part actually
121:49 - that's the part that's going to get a
121:50 - little bit confusing for most of you
121:52 - guys
121:52 - so
121:54 - i'm going to create something called a
121:56 - generate items section and here's how
121:59 - i'll do it so
122:00 - i'm going to create a function called
122:01 - generate items
122:04 - generate
122:08 - function
122:12 - i'm just like i'm well past confused but
122:14 - i'm learning so it's like again you're
122:16 - creating an object but uh you're putting
122:19 - the id of the object and then you're
122:21 - putting the data of the object okay
122:24 - so it's creating your function
122:26 - and it's called
122:28 - generate
122:30 - a items
122:34 - boom okay
122:35 - generate items inside the general items
122:38 - i'm going to pass in these items some
122:39 - say items here
122:41 - right here and i'm going to call this
122:43 - after i actually get all my items from
122:44 - database i'm gonna say generate items
122:47 - and items
122:49 - boom done save boom done okay
122:52 - great that's exactly what i want
122:55 - now inside here is a few things i'm
122:58 - going to loop through every single item
123:01 - okay items
123:03 - you probably can see at this point item
123:04 - is done for each
123:09 - but
123:10 - that for each so for every single item
123:12 - again i'm looping through every single
123:13 - item
123:15 - okay
123:16 - let me go ahead and and let me say
123:18 - insert it with dom that's right we're
123:21 - going to insert it
123:22 - okay with dom so i'm going to say
123:24 - console.log
123:27 - the item for now
123:35 - save it
123:37 - console the log item
123:42 - and we have ears individual items one
123:44 - two three that's the one that we got
123:46 - from a database is coming directly from
123:47 - here okay everybody see that
123:52 - it's okay so
123:53 - the this portion usually is going to be
123:55 - a little more confusing guys okay so as
123:57 - long as you cut up some sam that's good
123:59 - okay just kind of loop just gonna dig
124:02 - with me okay here
124:04 - um
124:06 - a few things are gonna happen here
124:08 - so
124:09 - remember when we are looping through
124:11 - items we need to add them to our to-do
124:14 - items correct
124:15 - right
124:17 - well um
124:18 - check this one out
124:21 - huh how do i do this make it simpler for
124:23 - you
124:24 - well okay so first things first i'm
124:27 - going to do is i'm going to create an
124:28 - item's html a section here so i'm going
124:29 - to say let items html
124:33 - right i'm really going to create our um
124:35 - literally going to create my html here
124:38 - right the html i'm going to put inside
124:40 - the html document okay
124:43 - okay after that i'm going to say items
124:45 - that items html
124:47 - i'm going to say plus equal to so i'm
124:49 - appending some html and i'm going to use
124:51 - i'm going to use something called string
124:52 - literals right here guys
124:55 - i know you're like what the hell we're
124:56 - doing those we'll check it out
124:59 - plus equal to is you're literally
125:00 - concatenating your html right i'm going
125:03 - to take my to-do item
125:05 - that's coming in from here
125:07 - right here
125:08 - right
125:09 - i'm taking my to-do item guys like this
125:12 - take it copy it right
125:14 - that's why we did it in the first inside
125:16 - html
125:17 - i'll go back to script tech
125:19 - and inside string literals which by the
125:21 - way if you don't know what string labels
125:22 - are
125:23 - it's this little key tag on the the on
125:25 - the left keyboard right here
125:27 - let's get all the way on the left hand
125:28 - side
125:30 - but
125:30 - this will allow us to use variables
125:32 - you'll see what i mean exactly
125:35 - paste the whole html in
125:41 - that's right now it's a sas product
125:42 - that's correct yes
125:43 - right paste the whole 8 tillman html in
125:49 - boom
125:50 - okay i turn off the music for support
125:52 - here
125:55 - wait
126:01 - okay never mind
126:03 - okay so inside this html okay awesome
126:05 - sweet
126:06 - but really cool thing we can do with
126:08 - this one is like i said because you're
126:10 - using string literals i can actually
126:12 - change this up guys
126:15 - i can actually change this up to be like
126:16 - this let's change it up change it up to
126:18 - be a uh
126:19 - um look at this i'm using variables now
126:22 - item
126:23 - dot text
126:25 - you see what i mean so depending on what
126:28 - the item is remember i go back to here
126:30 - and i expect element on this one
126:33 - right
126:35 - this is the item this whole thing
126:37 - we get the text portion from it using
126:39 - item.txt
126:41 - and we simply replace it inside this
126:42 - html document
126:44 - this html tidbit
126:46 - and i'm going through every single
126:49 - element
126:50 - i'm going through every single and i'm
126:52 - pushing it into the items html right
126:55 - so then here's the cool part then i can
126:57 - do the following then i can say like
126:59 - this i can say here i can say
127:01 - after i loop through everything here
127:04 - [Music]
127:07 - okay
127:10 - [Music]
127:16 - after i look through everything here
127:20 - okay
127:21 - i'm gonna say uh let me see here
127:26 - i'm gonna go to the parent one that to
127:27 - do items here
127:29 - yeah to do items that's right to do
127:31 - items that's correct i'm gonna go to the
127:33 - parent one okay
127:34 - and then i will say here the following
127:36 - will say
127:38 - document
127:39 - that query selector
127:42 - the query center okay ready
127:44 - i'm going to say to do items
127:47 - right i'm using the class i'm going to
127:48 - say that in our html
127:51 - html is equal to
127:53 - the item's html that i created
128:01 - and that's it guys
128:03 - so look
128:05 - what we have now go to the gym go to the
128:07 - market right there look guys look i
128:09 - called the function generate items
128:12 - i'm passing in the list from the
128:14 - database
128:15 - i'm creating the html on the fly
128:18 - and all i'm doing is i'm setting it i'm
128:20 - replacing the inner html of this
128:23 - big div
128:25 - this big to do items div
128:27 - with the html that i created myself it's
128:30 - called
128:31 - dinamically
128:34 - you see this is static
128:37 - if i use javascript i'm doing it
128:39 - dynamically
128:41 - but of course guys we're not done
128:44 - we're not done
128:46 - okay
128:47 - because the reason being actually is
128:50 - well
128:52 - a few things actually
128:55 - i have to be able to click on this and
128:57 - have this actually make this a completed
129:00 - item
129:03 - lucas i'll spend the next eight hours
129:05 - that's good that's good
129:07 - right
129:08 - i have to be able to click on this right
129:11 - here
129:12 - oh oops sorry my bad
129:15 - i should be able to click on this
129:19 - on this items html right here or on this
129:23 - check mark to be able to market complete
129:25 - it okay
129:25 - well to click on it one we have to
129:28 - create an event list so when i click on
129:30 - this i have to call some kind of a
129:32 - function correct yes or no i have to
129:33 - call something
129:34 - something needs to be done when i click
129:36 - on it
129:38 - right so when i click something needs to
129:40 - be done well how can i do that what
129:42 - should this out i'm going to create a
129:43 - function called called function i'm
129:46 - going to say function
129:48 - create
129:49 - event
129:50 - listeners
129:53 - that's right
129:56 - and so what i'm going to do is the
129:58 - following i'm going to say let all to do
130:01 - items
130:03 - is let me see let all to do not item but
130:06 - to do to do let's say check marks for
130:08 - now check marks

133:19 - after i click on this check mark i'm
133:21 - going to call the function to to do
133:23 - something right to like mark this

133:27 - function
133:29 - called mark completed
133:34 - right and inside that right
133:37 - we'll say hey console.log
133:43 - mark completed
133:46 - ow

133:57 - okay let me try that so i'm gonna say
133:59 - here now i'm gonna say mark completed
134:01 - i'm gonna call a function okay again
134:03 - random function
134:04 - but what am i doing i'm creating event
134:05 - listeners
134:07 - an event list or javascript is literally
134:08 - basically it's like i'm listening it's

134:26 - click on it
134:27 - it's going to do something

134:30 - so
134:31 - let's try it
134:33 - okay right click and spike the element

134:48 - with that being said let's actually
134:50 - update our item so look to update our
134:53 - item now with the specific id
134:56 - okay
134:57 - to market completed what are we gonna do
134:59 - well
135:00 - first we need to actually grab the item
135:01 - database remember we are updating an
135:04 - item that's already existing
135:06 - so to update an item
135:08 - let me show you
135:10 - add data every day i'm going to show you

135:27 - me see update
135:30 - update
135:31 - right here at the bottom
135:33 - here so what do we do the first we need
135:35 - to grab the specific so we we grab the
135:37 - collection so let's do that right now so
135:39 - we'll do
135:40 - db
135:41 - dot collection just so we have it here
135:43 - what collection we're doing to do items
135:47 - right then we see what dot what dot doc
135:51 - but you see we have to grab it by the id
135:55 - but like
135:56 - what id we do need to grab like where's
135:58 - id coming from this is a specific id the
136:00 - id i'm looking for is actually
136:03 - this id see this id right here
136:06 - this id this is the unique id that's
136:09 - going to allow me to reference it it's
136:10 - the address basically to this id
136:12 - but we don't have it like all we did was
136:14 - call this function where do we supposed
136:16 - to get it like where
136:19 - mm-hmm
136:24 - what do you guys think
136:25 - anybody any ideas
136:30 - from a db yeah but okay great but well
136:32 - how do you know what we clicked on how
136:34 - do we know that because remember um well
136:36 - this one has a unique id so does this
136:38 - one so does this one right every single
136:40 - item has a unique id
136:46 - we're actually going to go from the
136:47 - check mark guys
136:49 - so look at this
136:51 - let's console the check mark
136:57 - look when i go ahead and i actually
136:59 - might complete it i can actually give it
137:02 - but actually not yet because look at
137:04 - this
137:05 - check mark is an actual it's familiar i
137:07 - know i know sam i know go the restroom
137:10 - go to the restroom i want to go buy a
137:11 - restaurant too trust me trust me i'm
137:13 - gonna go to the bathroom too
137:14 - [Laughter]
137:16 - but you should not go right now
137:19 - um
137:20 - okay
137:21 - so what we want to do with this one is
137:23 - is actually kind of like this okay i'm
137:25 - going to go ahead and and uh well let me
137:28 - see i'll click on it
137:30 - hmm market completed
137:33 - i'm gonna use something inside my html
137:36 - you'll see what i mean here don't worry
137:38 - about it
137:39 - i'm gonna do an attribute called data
137:41 - dash id
137:45 - dash id
137:46 - is equal to a string
137:48 - and i'm going to give it the id that
137:50 - comes from my item guys from the
137:52 - database let me say item
137:55 - oh item
137:57 - that id
138:01 - so i'm going to pass into every single
138:03 - uh check mark on the id of the actual
138:05 - item so check it out now so here's how
138:07 - this gonna work if you look now look
138:11 - if you look at here inspect element on
138:13 - this one
138:15 - you can see it's it's pretty simple now
138:17 - right so every single look at this if i
138:19 - look at my check mark you see we have a
138:21 - unique id so every single item has a
138:24 - unique id
138:26 - that we get from database right now how
138:29 - do we grab that when we actually create
138:31 - an event listener well well what we can
138:33 - do is the following
138:35 - so here
138:36 - grab
138:38 - get data
138:39 - uh data set id from element
138:46 - right here
138:49 - a few ways all you got to do is if you
138:51 - do it properly
138:53 - i'll show you here
138:56 - is something called dataset
138:59 - no no no no no
139:02 - no no no no no right here
139:04 - so
139:06 - it's called that data set so you see how
139:07 - they're using an id here
139:09 - or did they did that info so i'm gonna
139:11 - say the following say here i'm gonna say
139:14 - i'm gonna pass in here check mark
139:17 - right here that's the element
139:19 - that data set
139:22 - set
139:23 - the id
139:26 - that's right i know this is crazy huh
139:28 - crazy stuff that's okay
139:31 - okay so this check mark that's the
139:34 - actual element right that's the element
139:35 - coming from where from here that's the
139:38 - html element because this html has
139:40 - almond has an id which is if you inspect
139:43 - them on this one has
139:45 - is
139:46 - this one
139:48 - the way you can grab it is
139:50 - dataset.id and so now i can pass this
139:53 - into here guys look at this i can say
139:55 - now okay okay cool
139:58 - mark completed let me say console.log
140:01 - id
140:04 - okay
140:05 - cool
140:06 - inspect element this one
140:09 - console
140:10 - click on it
140:12 - oh
140:12 - oh
140:13 - oh
140:14 - oh you see if i keep clicking on this
140:16 - one look at this inspect element guys
140:18 - look at this guys
140:20 - i'm clicking it's ld06 aw
140:24 - right that's the one i clicked on
140:26 - if i go to console
140:29 - ld608w right there
140:33 - you see what i mean
140:34 - so we got the id and because we now have
140:37 - this id we can now update it this is we
140:39 - got the address that we clicked on
140:41 - that's the cool part about this okay so
140:44 - pay attention here
140:46 - i'm going to grab this idea by the id
140:47 - like this
140:48 - all right
140:49 - then i'm going to do the following i'm
140:51 - going to say okay well i'm going to grab
140:53 - it first because i want to check if it
140:55 - exists i'm going to update it okay so
140:56 - look at this
140:58 - i'm going to say
141:00 - i'm going to actually save this into a
141:01 - variable select item
141:05 - item
141:06 - is equal to the collection i'm going to
141:08 - grab this item from the database this is
141:09 - again
141:11 - coming from a database from a database
141:15 - okay
141:18 - from this is coming from my database
141:19 - okay after that
141:21 - this took me in bubble io a few minutes
141:24 - but this is much more fun
141:28 - yeah this is a lot different than than
141:30 - what you'll get with these uh automatic
141:33 - creation stuff
141:34 - so look okay great then i'm going to
141:37 - grab it item.yet i'm going to grab that
141:39 - specific item
141:40 - that's that's just how i was supposed to
141:42 - do it with the database and then when i
141:44 - grab it i'm going to use something
141:45 - called then
141:47 - inside is that then i'm going to do a
141:48 - function
141:51 - function
141:53 - to do apart are you talking about this
141:55 - one
141:56 - the actual this one you see i put the id
141:58 - inside here guys if you're if you're
141:59 - wondering
142:00 - right here
142:02 - i'm going to call it a function
142:06 - function and then inside this function
142:08 - okay i've got myself this document
142:13 - that we we're getting from a database
142:15 - and it's a document and say here inside
142:16 - this document i say what i want to say
142:18 - if
142:19 - this document exists
142:22 - in the database again this this is
142:24 - something we can do in firebase
142:27 - if it exists in database here's what
142:28 - i'll do
142:30 - i'm going to what
142:31 - well let's console the log
142:34 - the status of this document i'm gonna
142:36 - say just document dot
142:38 - data
142:44 - here is oh i'm gonna say here like this
142:47 - here is the dock
142:53 - boom
142:55 - okay done so
142:58 - here's a dog
143:00 - okay cool uh let's see how this works
143:02 - out now i'm really curious now how this
143:03 - works out
143:06 - let me see here
143:08 - i'm gonna
143:09 - right click inspect them on this one
143:13 - console click on it
143:17 - oh
143:18 - this is coming directly from a database
143:20 - guys
143:21 - directly from a database look at this
143:25 - right
143:27 - so look i'm going to grab it now here
143:29 - now if document exists i'm going to add
143:31 - another if stream i'm going to check the
143:33 - the actual status so remember if we
143:36 - click on this
143:37 - if the status currently is active we're
143:40 - going to make it until completed but if
143:42 - i click on it again then i'm going to
143:43 - say completed to active so for example
143:46 - i'm going to say the following i'm going
143:47 - to say if
143:49 - actually i'm going to say so someone
143:51 - says let's status
143:55 - watch this stat
143:57 - status
144:00 - status
144:02 - is equal to doc
144:04 - dot data right here
144:06 - dot status like this okay
144:10 - beautiful i'm gonna say here if the
144:13 - status
144:15 - is equal to
144:18 - active
144:19 - right
144:20 - then we update it to be completed then
144:22 - we say item right here
144:25 - the update
144:27 - right that's the firebase function
144:29 - and we say what the status now
144:32 - now is which one what is it now
144:40 - sam is like it is so much easier to make
144:42 - a to-do list on a piece of paper with
144:44 - marker
144:47 - that's so true
144:48 - but where would the fun and that be huh
144:51 - right now we call the completed status
144:54 - that's right
144:55 - otherwise
144:57 - else if
144:59 - the status
145:01 - is equal to what
145:03 - completed
145:05 - and we click on it
145:07 - and what we change what do we update to
145:08 - now
145:09 - the update
145:12 - the update to what
145:15 - status of what what status will does it
145:17 - become
145:21 - active you see that guys right there
145:24 - active
145:26 - that's it so now it becomes actually not
145:28 - like this active
145:32 - that's it it becomes active my friends
145:36 - my partially just went to the roof david
145:38 - says
145:40 - it's okay trust me guys it's okay
145:43 - so look
145:44 - now look it's just what happened we
145:45 - checked we got the document from
145:47 - database we get the status we check if
145:50 - the current status inside the database
145:51 - is active we change to completed and if
145:54 - the current status aside uh this is
145:56 - completed dimension to active so it's
145:58 - kind of like that okay
145:59 - so let's actually check to feel how this
146:01 - works out so let me see so we have the
146:03 - go to the gym okay currently inside our
146:05 - database go the gym is an active status
146:08 - okay if i click on it it should
146:10 - technically be completed okay
146:13 - let's try it so if i click on it let me
146:16 - right click on this one let me make sure
146:17 - there's no error here
146:21 - just oh you're here okay click on it
146:24 - okay so we get the database stuff great
146:26 - awesome sweet all right let's go to our
146:29 - database
146:30 - hey it says completed right there look
146:34 - guys we got it my friends we
146:37 - got it
146:38 - got it
146:40 - that's right
146:41 - okay that's correct right you see
146:43 - now what can we do
146:46 - to make sure that when i click on it
146:48 - right when it's completed it's actually
146:49 - is completed and you know it has the
146:52 - check mark right away well
146:54 - again this is gonna come from when we
146:55 - render the actual thing so when we
146:56 - render okay
146:58 - okay when we render something
147:00 - i'm going to say the following no no no
147:04 - this is some cool stuff guys some cool
147:06 - stuff but it's some advanced stuff
147:08 - that's what i call it
147:10 - on this check mark you see here
147:13 - here's a
147:15 - like mercedes if
147:17 - if
147:18 - if okay if it's completed i'm going to
147:21 - give it a class of check so check this
147:23 - out
147:24 - okay if when we get it from a database
147:26 - and
147:27 - the item is completed i'm going to give
147:30 - it a special class
147:32 - because that way i can actually change
147:35 - the style of it so check this out i'm
147:36 - going to say here
147:38 - i'm going to use again these fancy curly
147:41 - brackets with the money sign
147:44 - again the string literals allows us to
147:46 - actually put javascript inside our
147:47 - strings okay this is so cool part i'm
147:49 - going to say this if the item.status
147:55 - status
147:57 - is equal to
148:00 - okay
148:04 - okay
148:05 - well you might gonna hate me this one
148:07 - is equal to completed
148:11 - i'm gonna use this operator and
148:14 - uh well
148:16 - checked so hold on
148:19 - if it's able to complete it then what
148:21 - i'm going to do
148:23 - if that's true i'm gonna output
148:26 - checked
148:28 - otherwise i'm going to output nothing
148:32 - so this is an if else statement it's a
148:34 - shortcut for an fnl statement so check
148:36 - this out basically if the status of this
148:39 - item that we are outputting is completed
148:42 - if that is true i'm going to mark it as
148:45 - checked i'm going to going to add a
148:46 - class called checked otherwise i'm going
148:48 - to add no class which is an empty string
148:50 - that's it that's all i'm doing here
148:52 - right so let's let's see what we got
148:54 - here
148:56 - let me go ahead here and inspect them on
148:58 - this one
149:01 - let's see is it checked or no
149:04 - is it checked
149:06 - it is indeed check guys check this out
149:10 - it's checked right here
149:12 - this my friends is checked and the other
149:15 - ones are the other ones checked or no
149:18 - no they're not because they're not
149:19 - completed yet right so now check this
149:22 - out let's do the same thing for this to
