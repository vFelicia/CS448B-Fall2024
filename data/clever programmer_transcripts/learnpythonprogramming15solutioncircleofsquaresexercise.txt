00:00 - okay in the last video I propose a
00:01 - challenge to you make a square out make
00:03 - a circle out of squares so hopefully you
00:06 - give it a try
00:07 - I hopefully you put it in the comments
00:10 - below okay so if you're watching this
00:11 - video right now whatever you got I don't
00:13 - care if it's crap I don't care what what
00:15 - it is I want you to put it in the
00:17 - comments below
00:18 - okay so whether you go to whether you go
00:23 - to my website at clever programmer comm
00:27 - and put it in learn Python for beginners
00:31 - we have a comment section so for example
00:33 - you can go into one of these videos I'm
00:37 - gonna have this video up there as well
00:39 - when you guys come to watch I want you
00:41 - to put your code in the comments below I
00:42 - will look at it personally and one of
00:45 - our members will also look at it okay
00:47 - so right over here or you can just put
00:50 - it on the YouTube channel that's totally
00:52 - fine as well
00:53 - alright so let's get to it first of all
00:57 - what I want to do is I have the square
01:00 - function which is really cool but it's
01:03 - really repetitive right it does um
01:07 - I mean if you can see all all a square
01:09 - is is you move forward and you turn
01:12 - right and you repeat that four times
01:13 - right so why do we have it here like
01:16 - this this is really bad um there's a lot
01:21 - of redundancy in our logic right um like
01:26 - if you were telling your sister your
01:29 - brother your dad your friend whoever D
01:31 - steps you would be like move forward
01:32 - turn right and then do that four times
01:34 - that's how you would tell it to them
01:36 - okay
01:36 - you wouldn't say move forward turn right
01:38 - move forward turn right ah move forward
01:43 - and then turn right and oh yeah move
01:46 - forward and turn right right so you
01:47 - wouldn't do that so if we look at this
01:49 - actually we're doing the step once here
01:52 - then we're doing the same step twice
01:55 - here then we're doing the same step
01:58 - three times here and we're doing the
02:01 - same step four times here what does that
02:05 - mean when we're doing something over and
02:07 - over again well it sounds like a loop so
02:11 - I want this thing to happen for
02:13 - how do I sit do something in four times
02:16 - in Python I just say for something in
02:18 - range so I'll say for I in range for
02:20 - that's it this will do that thing four
02:24 - times and I'll simply go here and remove
02:27 - that code
02:28 - okay so already our code looks much
02:33 - nicer and that's a way better way of
02:36 - making a square okay so notice it still
02:41 - takes length and angle so if we're
02:44 - making a function we need to pass those
02:45 - variables length and angle right so then
02:48 - length here and angle here can become
02:50 - those so we want like let's say length
02:52 - to be 100 and our angle to be 90 degrees
02:55 - so square makes a square let's verify
02:59 - our hypothesis here and remember this
03:02 - function all functions you got to put
03:05 - open closed parenthesis after them and
03:07 - you got to pass in an argument for this
03:10 - function here so we're gonna say 100 for
03:12 - the length and I'm gonna say 90 for the
03:14 - angle okay I can also say it like this
03:17 - just so the code is you know more clear
03:20 - what it's doing okay I can say it like
03:25 - that but let's keep it keep it short and
03:27 - sweet here let's run it and that should
03:31 - make a square right it made a square
03:33 - great mmm
03:35 - now what we're going to do is well we
03:38 - want to keep making squares right so we
03:41 - know we're going to put it in some kind
03:42 - of loop let's say we want to do it 100
03:45 - times okay
03:49 - alright so I'm gonna put it in the loop
03:51 - because I want to make a lot of squares
03:54 - and each time I make a square I want to
03:57 - turn so let me first get out of this
03:59 - loop and let me do this let me say my
04:03 - turtle dot right ninety degrees okay and
04:08 - let me do this now and you'll see that
04:12 - as soon as I make that I turn a turn a
04:14 - little bit actually not ninety degrees
04:16 - let's turn I don't know ten degrees 90
04:21 - degrees is silly so I make a square and
04:23 - then I turn just like that I'm ready to
04:25 - make another square so let's do that
04:27 - let's make another square right here I
04:32 - make a square I turn a little bit I make
04:34 - another square okay you get the idea now
04:37 - we need this process to repeat a lot of
04:39 - times so we need to make a square and we
04:41 - need to turn right right so it's really
04:42 - this step and we want to do it again and
04:46 - again and again and again so sounds like
04:48 - we need to put it in a loop let me
04:50 - uncomment that line hit tab to indent it
04:54 - under the for loop so it knows it's a
04:56 - part of a for loop this variable here
04:59 - does not need to be called I by
05:00 - convention in the world of Python we
05:03 - usually call it I you call it bananas
05:06 - you can call it that you can call it an
05:07 - underscore you can call it whatever you
05:09 - want okay just a little bit about
05:12 - variables variables can't start with the
05:14 - number like five or something okay
05:17 - so perfect this looks pretty good let's
05:21 - give it a try okay I make a square I
05:26 - turn a little bit I make another square
05:28 - I turn a little bit I make another
05:29 - square I turn a little bit beautiful
05:31 - that's looking really good let me close
05:34 - this let me make the speed really fast
05:36 - so let me make this seis turtle that's
05:39 - speed zero and that makes it run really
05:41 - really fast so it's going and going and
05:46 - going and going and going and going and
05:49 - going
05:49 - but now notice the problem it's not
05:54 - drawing anything new but it's moving hmm
05:59 - so it's moving a lot but it's not make
06:02 - anything new where does it stop making
06:05 - new things let's check it out let's say
06:08 - we want to do this how many times let's
06:10 - say we want to do this 30 or let's say
06:15 - we want to do this loop 40 times let's
06:18 - take let's check it out so let's see
06:20 - where it stops making it new so the last
06:25 - four times it ran you guys probably
06:27 - didn't catch it but the last four times
06:29 - that ran it actually didn't make
06:30 - anything new so the 37th time it ran
06:32 - didn't make anything new 38 times 39th
06:34 - time and 40th time so what the heck
06:37 - happened well here's what happened three
06:41 - hundred and sixty degrees right those
06:44 - that's the number of degrees in a circle
06:46 - so a circle has 360 degrees now we want
06:52 - to make this circle like really nice and
06:56 - dense we don't want it to be how it was
06:59 - it our circle look pretty empty and the
07:03 - reason is okay so the circle has 360
07:05 - degrees now if we're turning ten degrees
07:09 - every single time right what's 360
07:13 - divided by ten that's how many times we
07:16 - can go in a direction if we turn right
07:19 - only ten degrees is 360 divisible by 10
07:23 - and the answer is yes and the answer is
07:26 - actually 36 right 360 divided by 10
07:32 - obviously you don't have to be a math
07:33 - genius and all that but you get back 36
07:36 - which means 10 perfectly goes into 360
07:39 - and isn't that awesome
07:42 - that that's the number of times you can
07:45 - actually make unique squares if you do
07:47 - if you choose 10 degrees
07:48 - it's beautiful seeing divisibility in
07:51 - visualizations so even math starts to
07:53 - become beautiful when you put it in
07:55 - terms of computer programming you guys
07:57 - this was one of my most favorite
07:59 - discoveries and I still get excited when
08:01 - I think about this I think that's pretty
08:03 - freaking awesome what can we do well
08:07 - pick a number that is not divisible
08:10 - right that 360 is not divisible by so
08:14 - how about
08:15 - great number I don't know like a prime
08:19 - number and what's a prime number that's
08:21 - really close to ten eleven so let's pick
08:24 - eleven right because 360 divided by
08:28 - eleven gives you something that's not
08:31 - divisible right like three hundred six
08:33 - is not divisible by 11
08:34 - eleven is a prime number so let's run
08:37 - this bad boy and check it out and let's
08:39 - run it a hundred times right not forty
08:41 - hundred times and let's check it out
08:47 - starting eleven degrees every time it
08:49 - makes a square you'll notice that it
08:51 - almost never repeats itself and they'll
08:54 - probably never repeat itself and it just
08:56 - keeps making a circle darker and darker
08:58 - and darker and denser and that's how you
09:01 - want it right look at how beautiful that
09:04 - looks
09:05 - dark in the middle and starts to get
09:08 - lighter on the outer edges and those
09:10 - webs are interweaving and it's gorgeous
09:13 - right bonus bonus project I can give you
09:17 - guys for this is bring some colors out
09:20 - make some cool designs go look up
09:22 - trinket dot IO go to that website check
09:26 - it out um look at some examples paste
09:29 - your code below you can help out other
09:32 - people I can help you out if I look at
09:36 - your code you have some errors or it
09:39 - looks really cool and maybe I can help
09:41 - you make it look even better or maybe
09:43 - you'll just make something that will
09:44 - blow my mind because I haven't made such
09:46 - beautiful circles out of squares anyways
09:50 - I hope you guys enjoyed it I hope it
09:52 - makes sense please like the video
09:54 - subscribe I'll see you in the next
09:56 - lesson
