00:00 - one wrong line of code can cost you
00:02 - billions of
00:09 - dollars this is what just recently
00:11 - happened if you are not aware all
00:13 - Microsoft computers recently just kind
00:15 - of went down millions of them were
00:17 - affected by it and there was absolute
00:19 - chaos there was flight shortages
00:21 - hospitals not being able to provide
00:24 - medical care because their computers
00:26 - were shutting down everybody's computers
00:28 - at home were shutting down and able to
00:30 - use and this was not a Cyber attack but
00:32 - it was actually just a uh byproduct of
00:36 - writing bad code like here's some funny
00:39 - but also crazy stuff happening so this
00:41 - guy over here made a tweet and he's
00:43 - saying that uh this is the first time in
00:46 - his life he got a handwritten boarding
00:48 - pass and it's also funny to me because
00:51 - I'm such a Mack Advocate my whole life
00:54 - and I just feel part of me feels
00:56 - Vindicated for all those going go Mac
00:59 -  Windows microsof so I'm Sorry
01:03 - by the way if you're suffering from this
01:04 - and if you are actually drop it in the
01:05 - comments below I want to know if it's
01:07 - affecting you as well and the problem is
01:09 - there's probably some developer that
01:11 - ended up writing this code and didn't
01:14 - think it was going to be that bad but
01:15 - one little misstep in attention to
01:17 - detail can cause just everything to go
01:19 - down and it's probably an intern it's
01:21 - probably somebody who's a junior
01:23 - developer I mean it could even be stand
01:24 - our developer but mostly the problem is
01:26 - lack of attention to detail it isn't so
01:28 - much all of us just writing bad code
01:31 - it's not fully paying attention and
01:34 - what's sad is to cover up that person's
01:36 - mistake of course the CEO and the
01:38 - founder of the company has to explain
01:40 - what happened and take responsibility
01:41 - and here's kind of his response when he
01:43 - was put on the spot on TV and look at
01:45 - how nervous he got single software bug
01:48 - can have such a profound and immediate
01:51 - impact well when you look at the
01:54 - complexity of cyber security you're
01:56 - always trying to stay one excuse me one
01:59 - step ahead of the
02:01 - adversaries excuse me and just one
02:04 - second please oh yeah take take a drink
02:07 - of
02:08 - [Music]
02:09 - water she goes yeah take a drink of
02:12 - water that's I
02:14 - mean what are you going to do so this is
02:16 - tough but this is what happens when
02:19 - you're not like the more we go into this
02:21 - world of Chad G and Claude and
02:24 - everything else that's right in code for
02:25 - you you need to also understand that you
02:29 - still have a big job to do which is you
02:31 - still need to pay attention to what it's
02:33 - writing you still need to verify and
02:35 - double check and triple check and
02:37 - quadruple check the code and you need to
02:40 - test it relentlessly especially if
02:43 - you're a security company especially if
02:45 - you're only job is to secure things so
02:49 - this a mistake can happen to anybody it
02:51 - just sucks when it happens at such a big
02:53 - scale and it's sad because this is what
02:56 - the world of Microsoft is looking like
02:58 - right now the Dre reded blue screen of
03:00 - death and we all know that and we've all
03:02 - seen it I used to use Windows computers
03:05 - as well before um when I was a
03:08 - juvenile when I used to play video games
03:11 - and then I switched over to um Apple but
03:15 - I just want to send you this message and
03:16 - it's just like hey pay attention to
03:18 - details you still have to learn coding
03:20 - you still have to learn how it works
03:22 - under the hood even when the AI keeps
03:24 - getting stronger there needs to be
03:26 - somebody who can still debug but your
03:28 - debugging is going to to start going to
03:30 - a higher higher level and you're going
03:32 - to need to start becoming Smarter with
03:34 - how you use these tools and I also want
03:35 - to show you like the emotional
03:37 - consequences of that code right and how
03:40 - it affects people so take a look at this
03:43 - all right
03:45 - now get on
03:47 - [Music]
03:48 - this all right so everyone's going to
03:51 - shut up and we're going to this once and
03:54 - we're only going to say it again CU
03:56 - we're frustrating as h
04:03 - I'm sorry and so I'll pause it but you
04:05 - can see the absolute chaos that's
04:07 - happening here right like all these
04:09 - people waiting on their flights missing
04:11 - their flights I mean one of my friends
04:12 - told me
04:15 - that uh she was she was flying out and
04:19 - uh uh she got delayed by 25 hours um
04:24 - that's how long the delay was in her
04:25 - flight because things shut down and
04:27 - there were other people now luckily for
04:29 - her she was just kind of flying back
04:31 - home but she met this one lady and now
04:34 - one lady's uh I believe nephew died of
04:38 - cancer and the funeral was happening so
04:40 - like she couldn't afford to miss that
04:41 - flight she needed to go and you know
04:44 - kind of just U see him one last time and
04:50 - so uh my friend then ended up helping
04:52 - them and helping them book their flight
04:54 - but like that's the level of impact that
04:56 - can happen right and you don't really
04:58 - realize it because you're just like okay
04:59 - I'm just going to do this one line of
05:00 - code and then I'm just going to hit push
05:02 - and it should go live and then that's it
05:05 - things should be fine and as much as I
05:06 - like to joke around and Raz Microsoft
05:08 - it's not necessarily just Microsoft you
05:10 - know this could happen on Mac this could
05:12 - happen on Linux it can happen on
05:14 - anything it just so happened that it
05:16 - happened with Microsoft understand why
05:19 - this happened this is what low attention
05:21 - to detail looks like this is what
05:23 - happens when you care less this is what
05:25 - happens when you don't really give a
05:28 -  it's not necess Lally the
05:30 - consequences of being bad it's a
05:32 - consequence of some people's lack of
05:35 - care lack of attention to detail now
05:37 - attention to detail isn't something you
05:38 - can just magically develop but it can be
05:41 - developed if you spend a lot of time
05:43 - learning and learning how to learn
05:46 - faster because the quicker you learn
05:49 - from your mistakes the less likely you
05:51 - are to then make them later and so if
05:54 - you speed up your learning progress
05:55 - you're genuinely going to just end up
05:57 - making more mistakes and when you make
05:59 - more mistakes
06:00 - you look back at them and you learn from
06:02 - them and it's a feedback and it's a loop
06:03 - and it keeps feeding on itself and I was
06:06 - talking with a friend of mine named IOD
06:09 - and he said something incredible he said
06:10 - learning is uh just reflection and
06:14 - intention and that actually summarizes
06:17 - deep learning and so it blew my mind
06:20 - because if you think about how AI learns
06:23 - it's just reflecting and then it's
06:26 - setting an intent so what does that mean
06:28 - it goes over its own games by itself so
06:30 - if it's trying to get better at chess it
06:32 - just plays a game and then it goes back
06:34 - and gives itself feedback off of that
06:36 - chess game and then it sets an intention
06:38 - of like I'm going to take those
06:39 - learnings and apply them to the next
06:42 - game and then it just does that every
06:44 - single time so if you do that you'll
06:46 - start to get better so I want to show
06:47 - you a tool uh me and my friend Nas
06:50 - actually built so that it could help you
06:52 - learn faster as a programmer and so
06:55 - here's an example so let's say this
06:56 - video right my good friend Tim Tech with
06:59 - he has a video that he dropped how to
07:02 - practice programming so you actually get
07:04 - good right so this is an example of a
07:05 - video I'm going to grab the link and I'm
07:09 - going to now paste this in the tool that
07:13 - we've created so here's an example I po
07:15 - this video in here right now I'm going
07:16 - to create a chat next to this and and
07:20 - I'm just going to take this video and
07:21 - connect it to the chat and now I'm just
07:24 - going to say hey give me I'm going to
07:27 - click this button says get key inside so
07:29 - it's going to going to just give me the
07:30 - key insights from this video he going to
07:32 - say hey here are the key things that he
07:34 - actually says uh from this video so I'm
07:38 - going to say give me some examples of
07:42 - that with some code and so now I can
07:45 - immediately start to take what I'm
07:47 - learning from this video and get some
07:49 - examples with code or I can say based on
07:54 - his video give me some
07:57 - practice exercise SL projects and now
08:01 - you see how I'm just taking his video
08:03 - and I'm interacting with it so that in
08:05 - speeds up my learning process so much
08:07 - and I can go on YouTube and I can type
08:09 - in more things like how to learn
08:11 - programming fast so that way I don't
08:14 - just have Tech with Tim but I have other
08:16 - people that I can learn from so here are
08:18 - some other great videos um I know
08:21 - developed by Ed is pretty damn good and
08:24 - he gives really good advice so I'm just
08:25 - going to copy this and I'm also going to
08:27 - paste this so now I got his video here
08:29 - as well and I can plug that in and now I
08:32 - can say what
08:35 - does
08:36 - developed by Ed say and so now it'll
08:40 - tell me what his video is actually
08:42 - saying and so I'm getting now feedback
08:44 - from both of the videos and now I can
08:47 - say based on both of these videos give
08:52 - me uh one
08:55 - example uh project and so now I'm
08:58 - combining both of those videos and it's
09:00 - saying hey start with the personal task
09:02 - manager web app and you can see how you
09:05 - can start to build on top of this
09:07 - knowledge base and it's not just that
09:10 - but you can also pop in your own code if
09:13 - you write your code into here for
09:15 - example and then you can connect that
09:17 - code here as well and say hey based on
09:20 - the code I wrote does that seem in line
09:22 - with what they're talking about and then
09:24 - it can start to get bigger and bigger
09:26 - and better and it can also help you with
09:28 - coding projects doing because sometimes
09:30 - in Chad GPT it's hard to give it all of
09:33 - the context here you can actually make a
09:35 - bunch of these notes paste everything
09:38 - and that'll serve as a knowledge base so
09:40 - this everything here that's on the left
09:41 - hand side is essentially a visual
09:43 - knowledge base and you can just connect
09:45 - and power this up so the reason I'm
09:47 - sharing this with you is because you can
09:50 - see how making mistakes can be so
09:53 - absolutely devastating and like took
09:55 - down essentially Microsoft uh you know
09:58 - maybe for a couple of days they'll be
09:59 - back up but it damaged Microsoft it
10:02 - damaged the crowdstrike company quite a
10:04 - lot and if you have tools like these
10:06 - where you can learn way faster you know
10:08 - here you can connect multiple different
10:11 - sources and verify like basically what I
10:14 - would do if I was that developer right
10:16 - is on the left hand side let me take
10:18 - this away on the left hand side I'll
10:20 - have all the company knowledge base of
10:23 - the security stuff that like I need to
10:25 - know or the tests that I need to it
10:27 - needs to run through and make sure it's
10:28 - good and then when I write my code I
10:31 - would have this run it through um and
10:36 - then check like hey is this code good is
10:38 - this going to cause any problems and he
10:41 - could use this to essentially double
10:43 - check as well but more importantly he
10:45 - can use this to learn even the stuff in
10:48 - his own company and maybe he would avoid
10:50 - these null pointer type of mistakes I
10:52 - think that's kind of what happened there
10:52 - was a something with C++ that caused the
10:56 - problem I know I saw it on Twitter but
10:58 - like you know Twitter so it could also
11:00 - be wrong um but if you guys know what
11:02 - happened you can let me know but these
11:04 - are the types of things it could help
11:06 - you catch and it could help you fix so
11:08 - we made this tool so you guys can use it
11:11 - you guys could use this visual knowledge
11:12 - base and really learn 10x faster than
11:15 - any of your competition so I would love
11:17 - for you to check it out and I want to
11:19 - see how this would help you as a
11:21 - developer with that said if you want to
11:23 - check it out I've put the link in the
11:25 - description where I'm giving you a 3-day
11:27 - free trial to use this as much as you
11:29 - want and if you don't like it you can
11:32 - cancel it before the 3 days if you do
11:35 - like it and love it only then keep it
11:37 - beyond the 3 days I think it's going to
11:39 - provide you with a lot of value it's
11:41 - going to be a thing that's going to make
11:42 - your colleagues jealous like how are you
11:43 - learning so fast what the heck is this
11:45 - thing and it just gets so damn powerful
11:48 - over time right where like if I have
11:52 - notes about my company I can literally
11:54 - start recording them in here so now it's
11:56 - capturing my voice and it's recording so
11:58 - as you can see on the left hand side
11:59 - here and if I get done speaking those
12:01 - notes or maybe it's this email that I
12:03 - just want to like kind of Speak Out Loud
12:05 - kind of casually if I hit end now that
12:08 - recording is also going to serve
12:10 - essentially as a knowledge base and you
12:12 - can see the transcript is here and it's
12:14 - made a title for my uh audio recording
12:17 - and I can even connect that now all of
12:19 - this is working as a visual knowledge
12:22 - base and you can use that to get the
12:25 - output that you want so super powerful
12:28 - I'd love for you to give it a try click
12:30 - the link below jump on the training uh
12:34 - sorry not the training but jump on the
12:36 - app and I do believe it's going to
12:38 - change your life we have so many
12:40 - customers who are dropping testimonials
12:42 - and sharing how much it's helped them
12:45 - I'll actually show you some so here's
12:46 - our slack and right inside of our slack
12:49 - right we have some customers here like
12:50 - one of our customers here is like I I'm
12:54 - definitely very impressed with the ease
12:55 - of it and the UI I like the concept more
12:57 - than just other normal DND like AI tools
13:01 - drag and drop AI tools and so this has
13:03 - that fory right where it's like a really
13:06 - nice UI and everything we had another
13:08 - person Curran and he goes thanks this
13:10 - worked this is a killer product I'm a
13:12 - blogger and it made many of my processes
13:15 - easy and he's asking if we have an
13:17 - affiliate program because he wants to
13:18 - share with other
13:20 - people uh unearthly use it he's like
13:22 - been using poyi can't stress how much I
13:24 - love it over all the other AI tools if
13:26 - you guys don't have poppy AI what are
13:28 - you doing
13:30 - um Holly used it and she said hey Nas I
13:32 - just got poppy this is how my brain
13:37 - works too it's been difficult to
13:39 - organize everything in my head with the
13:40 - tools out there I'm looking forward to
13:41 - being able to use Google Docs with it I
13:43 - really hope it can help me connect all
13:45 - the docs I've created that probably
13:46 - repeat my thoughts and extrapolate
13:48 - usable content from them you've just
13:50 - created what I think will be a
13:51 - GameChanger to getting the information I
13:53 - want to learn quickly I saw this as a
13:55 - possibility of a already I think books
13:57 - may end up being a thing of the past by
13:59 - changing how we get information so we
14:02 - got lots of students that are loving it
14:04 - lots and lots of testimonials and I
14:07 - would like for you to check it out and
14:09 - see how it impacts you and changes your
14:12 - life so super excited for you to give it
14:13 - a go love your face and I'll see you in
14:16 - the next video
14:20 - [Music]
