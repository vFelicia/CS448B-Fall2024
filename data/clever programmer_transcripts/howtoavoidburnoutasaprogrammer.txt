00:00 - hey you what is up how's it going this
00:02 - is Kazi from clever programmer calm in
00:04 - this video I want to talk to you about
00:06 - why coders or programmers burn out and
00:11 - how to avoid that in your life this is
00:15 - something that can impact you in your
00:18 - career as a programmer it could stop you
00:21 - from getting the job of your dreams it
00:23 - could stop you from becoming the
00:24 - programmer that you want to become and
00:26 - it destroys people's potential and
00:29 - career as a programmer so with that said
00:32 - and without any further ado let's jump
00:35 - right into it
00:37 - what is programmer burnout what is a
00:40 - what is burnout in general well burnout
00:42 - often times as grant cardone says I was
00:45 - gonna say I say but grant cardone says
00:46 - this he says you're not tired you're
00:48 - uninspired and burnout rarely ever
00:52 - happens because you're overworking
00:54 - because most people don't work that much
00:56 - and they don't actually push themselves
00:58 - to that limit most times
01:00 - burnout actually happens because people
01:03 - feel uninspired they're either doing the
01:05 - same thing over and over again or
01:07 - they're constantly getting frustrated
01:09 - and hitting a roadblock and that's the
01:11 - one thing that they're getting stuck by
01:13 - and so what happens when you keep
01:15 - getting stuck well eventually you will
01:17 - give up you will get uninspired and you
01:20 - will not want to move on so the one
01:22 - thing that can help you really break
01:24 - past any of these barriers and get
01:26 - virtually guaranteed that you're never
01:28 - gonna have a burnout is by setting
01:30 - really tiny little goals along the way
01:34 - to where you're trying to get to
01:36 - oftentimes I'll see some new programmers
01:38 - coming in and they're like you know I
01:39 - want to build the next Facebook I want
01:42 - to build the next Instagram I have this
01:43 - crazy idea too big of an ask too big of
01:47 - a task and when this start obviously
01:49 - they can't build it they're not ready
01:51 - oftentimes they give up they're burnt
01:53 - out now for other people the burnout
01:56 - happens even if you're big even if
01:58 - you're past a beginner right you're
01:59 - coding you're building projects but then
02:02 - eventually you forget what your goal is
02:05 - what you're doing and you kind of quit
02:07 - or give up so how does it work for me
02:10 - for example I'm gonna be competing in a
02:12 - powerlifting
02:13 - a petition in may May 25th is getting my
02:15 - first powerlifting competition to get to
02:18 - that I'm trying to make sure that I keep
02:21 - hitting everyday I increase my weight by
02:24 - two and a half pounds five pounds
02:26 - because I'm still in like the beginner
02:27 - face so I can keep making those gains
02:29 - and I have very systematic step-by-step
02:31 - things that cause me to win every day so
02:34 - when we bring it back to programming you
02:36 - need to set up these small incremental
02:38 - goals where you're winning every single
02:40 - day so let's say your job you're you do
02:43 - want to build an Instagram clone or you
02:47 - do want to build the next Facebook well
02:49 - you got to break it down what does a
02:51 - face what does Facebook have well you
02:54 - know I've talked about these topics
02:55 - before but I think it's really good to
02:56 - reiterate because as humans we need
02:58 - reminders all right like know why do we
03:03 - keep looking up how to stop
03:04 - procrastinating because all we need is
03:06 - reminders why do we need motivation just
03:08 - to be reminded and get back in that zone
03:10 - again okay so this is why I keep
03:12 - reiterating this so much but okay so
03:14 - let's say we want to build Facebook now
03:16 - just to break Facebook down into its
03:18 - component parts it's not just Facebook
03:20 - and boom that's it
03:23 - all right that's not actually what it is
03:26 - right when you're working on Facebook
03:29 - you need what is Facebook made of well
03:32 - we have login functionality so that's
03:35 - one we have log out functionality what
03:39 - else do we have do we have the ability
03:41 - to make a post yes so we can create
03:44 - posts we have a database that can store
03:47 - all the posts so when you create them
03:49 - and you log back into your account all
03:51 - your posts are saved somewhere it's kind
03:54 - of like a massive Excel spreadsheet so
03:56 - we need a database all right what else
04:01 - do we need after a database well we need
04:03 - to have a way we need to actually show
04:05 - this and make this look nice so we need
04:07 - to know HTML plus CSS if we're trying to
04:12 - make a clone of it okay
04:14 - we're not gonna be copying all of the
04:15 - technologies that are using let's say
04:17 - we're trying to build this with Python
04:18 - so what are what are we going to need
04:20 - well we need HTML and CSS to make
04:22 - Facebook look nice make it
04:25 - pretty okay what else do we need besides
04:27 - html/css well we need to know django so
04:31 - we can actually have something that
04:32 - speaks between all this pretty crap and
04:34 - the database okay so django just allows
04:38 - you in simple terms allows you to do
04:41 - that okay it allows you to speak between
04:43 - these two okay we got django and we will
04:47 - also need of maybe a few other
04:49 - technologies but let's just stop here
04:51 - for the sake of simplicity and not
04:54 - turning this into a technical exactly
04:56 - how do we make facebook but more so what
04:59 - is the general idea what's the message
05:01 - that i'm trying to get across here so
05:03 - when you're learning stuff one of your
05:07 - goals is to figure out how do you build
05:10 - a login logging in functionality all
05:13 - right oh we also have to upload this
05:15 - online right somewhere so maybe you need
05:17 - to know a technology like Heroku alright
05:20 - okay or digitalocean something where you
05:22 - can actually host this website online
05:24 - now you need to know login functionality
05:27 - that's kind of the first thing you need
05:29 - to know so i would start working on how
05:31 - does login functionality work or maybe
05:34 - i'll start with let me learn HTML CSS so
05:37 - then i can make a website look pretty so
05:38 - then when I build my Facebook clone I
05:40 - can make it look beautiful and you learn
05:44 - each technology as you go and you
05:46 - implement alright so this is how I
05:48 - learned so let's say I wanted to build a
05:50 - Facebook clone when I learned the login
05:52 - functionality at some point I went ahead
05:55 - in my app and I added this functionality
05:58 - okay then when I learned the logout
06:01 - functionality I went and added it to my
06:03 - app then when I learned to create post
06:05 - functionality I added it to my app and I
06:07 - would keep doing this and because I
06:09 - didn't know Heroku at the time and I
06:11 - didn't know how online stuff work I just
06:14 - used a module like tech enter in Python
06:17 - which basically allows you to make
06:19 - graphical user interfaces so it stands
06:23 - for GUI GUI and when it allows me to
06:27 - make graphical user interfaces well this
06:31 - just allows me to do it locally that's
06:33 - the cool thing about tech enter so I
06:34 - don't have to learn about all this crap
06:36 - about how do you post
06:39 - I didn't have to learn about Django at
06:41 - that point I don't have to learn about
06:42 - html/css I don't have to learn about
06:44 - databases so basically it it makes it
06:48 - simple for me to learn without adding
06:50 - too many complications so first I just
06:53 - learned GUI I learned there was a tech
06:55 - intern module
06:56 - I built a login functionality with a
06:57 - decanter module I built a log out
06:59 - functionality with the tech intern
07:01 - module I be able to create post
07:03 - functionality with that module and then
07:05 - when I needed to take it online and I
07:07 - was kind of stuck and I needed to know
07:08 - these things that's when I started
07:11 - actually learning about these things
07:13 - another big secret I will give you so
07:16 - you are not stuck on really really
07:20 - stupid things and just smashing your
07:23 - head against the wall constantly and not
07:27 - making any progress because in coding
07:28 - sometimes you get stuck with the dumbest
07:30 - errors a lot of people will know if they
07:33 - if you've ever tried to post something
07:35 - up online using Heroku you'll run into
07:37 - you stupid 500 internal service errors
07:40 - that don't help you at all improve your
07:43 - coding skills you'll not know what it is
07:45 - it'll turn out to be some small little
07:47 - bug and it will take you about let's say
07:49 - one week to figure out with five to
07:51 - eight hours a day of debugging very very
07:54 - painful and a total waste of your time
07:56 - so one secret I'll give you are coaches
08:03 - so what do you do what would I do here I
08:05 - would go to code mentor dot IO which is
08:09 - the online platform where there are
08:12 - mentors you pay them they help you there
08:15 - live it's almost like going to a pizza
08:17 - shop you ask for a pizza to give you
08:19 - Pizza you need help with code they help
08:21 - you with code right away and I used to
08:23 - have a mentor and her name is Jessamine
08:25 - she is in absolute killer badass she's
08:29 - usually always books I don't know if
08:31 - you're gonna get her or not
08:32 - but if you are going from this video
08:34 - message her that I sent you she's not
08:37 - gonna give you a good deal she might but
08:39 - she will definitely think that I'm
08:41 - awesome for doing that but yeah please
08:43 - let her know she loved that knowing that
08:45 - you're coming from me and she'll
08:46 - probably prioritize you higher I don't
08:48 - know but she's super awesome and she
08:51 - helped me a lot when I would when I used
08:53 - to get stuck with my coding problems and
08:55 - what would happen is like she'll just
08:57 - tell me right away what's the best
08:59 - resource and in what order should I go
09:01 - to add this database to my tech
09:03 - inter-app okay so for example she might
09:05 - just tell me hey right now don't add too
09:08 - much complication of adding online
09:09 - functionality just build a local
09:11 - database using like Excel spreadsheet or
09:13 - a CSV file and with your graphical user
09:16 - interface that'll work then later she
09:19 - might tell me okay now it's time for you
09:21 - to learn HTML and CSS and she would just
09:23 - guide me on the right track and save me
09:26 - countless hours on stupid errors not
09:29 - intelligent errors not the errors were
09:32 - reading debug them you increase your
09:34 - skill I'm talking about you lose your
09:37 - brain cells debugging some of these
09:40 - problems okay so those are the bad
09:42 - problems to debug that I'm talking about
09:44 - and you know this woman has saved me
09:48 - years of my life there are some other
09:50 - mentors that I hired from code mentor as
09:52 - well that helped me a lot but she was
09:54 - definitely my favorite just to wrap it
09:56 - up how do you avoid coders or
09:58 - programmers burnout you one have a big
10:01 - goal and to you you break that goal down
10:05 - into small component parts and then you
10:07 - learn those parts okay three you apply
10:11 - each of those things that you're
10:12 - learning to one of your projects and
10:15 - your apps this way you are implementing
10:18 - and taking action as you go and the
10:21 - fourth secret that I gave you is if you
10:23 - have a mentor when you're stuck you can
10:26 - literally go to a platform called code
10:28 - mentor dot IO they're coders on demand
10:31 - they can just help you right away and
10:33 - then you can move on with your life okay
10:36 - if you can't afford somebody who's
10:38 - charging higher prices like 30 or 60
10:40 - dollars an hour look for somebody who's
10:42 - charging $10 or $15 an hour and if even
10:45 - that's tough message them and say hey
10:48 - can we work something out
10:49 - that's the message for this video I hope
10:52 - that you enjoyed it if you did please go
10:54 - ahead and give this a little thumbs up
10:56 - really helps the channel we're trying to
10:58 - make this we're trying to grow this
11:00 - channel massively and we're trying to
11:03 - create like one video a day for you
11:05 - guys if not - that's our goal but the
11:07 - way we can do that is if you support
11:09 - this channel and the super easiest way
11:11 - for you to support this channel is

11:13 - then YouTube will put it in front of
11:16 - more people the more people that view it
11:18 - the more people will come into the
11:20 - clever programmer community and you're
11:23 - gonna keep getting tons of more videos
11:25 - and all we need from you is just the
11:26 - little thumbs up with that set thank you
11:28 - so much for watching subscribe to the
