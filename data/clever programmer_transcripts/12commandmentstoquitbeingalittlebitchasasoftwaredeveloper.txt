00:07 - hi my name is konzi from clever
00:10 - programmer calm this is a channel where

00:30 - continue now these 12 commandments that
00:32 - I'm about to share they are hopefully
00:36 - really profound for you I mean this is
00:38 - something that I have spent years
00:40 - curating not all of this is coming from
00:43 - my brain but tons of books that I've
00:45 - read I was inspired on an airplane ride
00:49 - back home from Chicago to LA to LA and
00:54 - on the airplane I decided to ride these
00:57 - because I saw and in one of the Facebook
01:01 - groups for our courses there was
01:04 - somebody who had a really negative
01:07 - mindset and when I saw how they thought
01:10 - and how that person talked it made me
01:14 - realize if a developer has those
01:18 - qualities it's very very difficult for
01:21 - them to succeed or really anybody has
01:23 - those qualities it's really difficult
01:24 - for them to succeed so I wanted to write
01:27 - out 12 commandments that no matter where
01:30 - your life is at if you followed these
01:32 - this would help you tremendously so
01:34 - let's just get straight into it number
01:37 - one read if you don't have a book in
01:43 - mind already to read I recommend reading
01:45 - Millionaire Fastlane for two hours a day
01:49 - starting today it's amazing how much of
01:54 - a profound impact reading can have on
01:56 - your life it has completely changed my
01:58 - life it has helped me do over 1.2
02:01 - million dollars in the last three years
02:03 - from complete zero and it has an impact
02:09 - on my fitness my mindset really
02:13 - everything
02:13 - so you know whether you want to do
02:15 - audible Kindle do it read number two
02:19 - consumption detox zero garbage n zero
02:23 - shows zero movies you're gonna suffer
02:26 - from withdrawal that's okay a lot of
02:29 - people go through a very terrible
02:30 - experience when they give up their shows
02:33 - and movies because it's something that
02:36 - you love so much even I do but if you
02:38 - really want to have a profound impact on
02:40 - your life this is one area where there's
02:42 - a lot of time that goes into I'll give
02:44 - you an example for it
02:47 - clever programmer and my brother who now
02:50 - has a really amazing channel called
02:52 - Waqas Kazi the cause man and he helps
02:55 - colorist
02:56 - become professional and help freelance
02:59 - helped become freelancers he never would
03:03 - have started his channel because he used
03:06 - to play fifa all the time that was his
03:08 - drug for me it was chess and video games
03:12 - and that stopped me and even TV shows
03:15 - that stopped me from actually creating a
03:18 - lot of amazing things in my life as a
03:20 - developer that might be stopping you
03:21 - from working on your portfolio spending
03:24 - two extra hours a day learning how to
03:26 - code it's so easy to just sit there and
03:29 - waste away two hours it doesn't even
03:31 - feel like anything but remember poor
03:33 - people are cheap with their money rich
03:37 - people are cheap with their time become
03:40 - cheap with your time because time is the
03:42 - only thing in life you'll never get back
03:43 - money you will always get back so take
03:47 - your time seriously
03:49 - number three track time set an alarm
03:52 - every thirty minutes and then just write
03:56 - down what you're doing seems extreme
03:58 - it's meant to be literally take a
04:01 - notepad or something and then just write
04:03 - down exactly what you're doing and all
04:06 - you got to do is just write down one
04:08 - word so if you're watching a movie just
04:10 - say Netflix if you are you know watching
04:14 - a show just say Netflix if you are doing
04:17 - emails or something else or something
04:20 - for entertainment just say entertainment
04:22 - that way after a week is over you can
04:25 - see how the time was spam
04:27 - what buckets and categories don't change
04:29 - anything just spend time and just track
04:31 - it every 30 minutes and write it down
04:32 - you'll be able to look at what
04:34 - percentage of your time went into
04:35 - wasteful things what percentage of your
04:38 - time went into things that helped you
04:39 - create what you will find at the end of
04:45 - the week is maybe there's 10 to 15% of
04:48 - your time being wasted somewhere or and
04:51 - when I say a waste I don't mean like
04:52 - you're spending with your family that's
04:53 - good time what I mean is that it's just
04:57 - being leaked because you're scrolling on
04:59 - Instagram for 3 hours a day very
05:03 - important place to check number for
05:09 - daily outreach manual EDM and reach out
05:14 - to 30 to 50 people per day if you're
05:19 - trying to increase your income as a
05:21 - freelance developer or you're just
05:22 - trying to increase your income with
05:23 - whatever skills that you have you need
05:25 - to be reaching out manually unless you
05:27 - have an audience already like look on my
05:29 - youtube channel I have an audience I
05:33 - have a big email list of people so for
05:37 - me I can I still called outreach for my
05:42 - new business I actually created as
05:43 - tik-tok then called outreach to those
05:45 - people and then landed a client from
05:46 - there for $2,000 a month for you if you
05:51 - don't have if you don't do content
05:53 - marketing and you aren't getting inbound
05:55 - leads meaning people coming to you you
05:58 - need to be reaching out at 30 to 50
05:59 - people a day if you are making less than
06:01 - $4,000 a month or $5,000 a month what
06:05 - are you doing if your goal is seriously
06:08 - to increase your income then that's what
06:10 - you need to be doing 30 to 50 people a
06:12 - day and offering to either teach them
06:14 - coding and charge them 500 dollars a
06:15 - month for four sessions per month or you
06:19 - can help freelance will you reach out to
06:21 - 30 to 50 people ask to intern but if you
06:24 - aren't in doing that and your income
06:25 - isn't going up I mean it's really your
06:27 - fault number five zero ego have an
06:31 - extreme learner attitude what I say is
06:35 - you can have a zero ego or you can have
06:37 - zero profit and if you want to keep your
06:39 - ego guess what
06:40 - you get to keep her debt this is
06:43 - extremely important what I see people
06:45 - doing a lot they'll join a group they'll
06:47 - join a community or they will get a
06:48 - coach or they will or they will find a
06:52 - mentor nearby them in real life you know
06:54 - like let's say you're going to meet up
06:56 - groups people bring their ego with them
07:00 - if you bring your ego you're gonna talk
07:02 - yourself out of opportunity do you know
07:04 - what I do when I'm with somebody who's
07:06 - doing ten million dollars a year or even
07:08 - one you know or even like one or five
07:11 - whatever million dollars if they are
07:14 - somehow ahead of me or peers of me and I
07:17 - can learn from them let me ask you a
07:20 - question well in what situation would
07:22 - they be able to help me more if they'd
07:24 - ask me hey how's your business doing and
07:26 - if I was like oh my god yeah my business
07:28 - is doing amazing it's off the charts
07:31 - versus if I just said I could use help
07:34 - I'm an idiot I'm not doing five million
07:37 - dollars a year that is when they would
07:41 - help me right if I actually keep my ego
07:43 - and I'm trying to be a smartass and I'm
07:45 - like I'm business doing great they will
07:46 - just look at me and go okay your
07:47 - business is doing great go on your way
07:51 - that's not gonna have any impact on my
07:53 - life but if I actually just put my ego
07:55 - away shut the [ __ ] up listen and and be
07:59 - attentive and drop my ego and just say I
08:02 - have no idea how to handle money
08:06 - they will open up and they will tell me
08:09 - hey this is what I do this is exactly
08:11 - what I'm doing at my taxes why don't you
08:12 - talk with my tax guy this is a strategy
08:15 - I use to grow my business that one
08:17 - strategy will help you and in my case
08:20 - helped me to make tens of thousands of
08:22 - dollars just still one sentence so when
08:27 - people are ahead of you it's like ATM
08:30 - machine every word that comes out of
08:31 - their mouth is just free value being
08:33 - thrown at you when you don't shut the
08:36 - [ __ ] up and you talk it's like you're
08:38 - interrupting a free ATM machine just
08:40 - throwing money at you and value at you
08:42 - and you're robbing your ownself number
08:47 - six don't hurt your little brain if
08:50 - somebody is ahead of you and you want to
08:54 - get to that level here's what I want you
08:57 - to do don't hurt your little brain
08:59 - blindly follow being a smartass will
09:03 - keep you broke forever if you spend
09:05 - fifty percent of your time questioning
09:08 - or challenging instead of executing you
09:10 - will slow down your own growth by 50
09:13 - percent or more
09:14 - I remember when I joined row meets
09:17 - eighties program zero to launch or when
09:20 - I joined some other programs with
09:22 - coaches like Mariah cause or my coach
09:25 - Ron when they would tell me something I
09:28 - would just blindly execute all of that
09:31 - time that I could have spent questioning
09:33 - challenging them coming off like a
09:35 - smartass coming off like I know it all
09:37 - I just shut up and I executed I was
09:41 - ahead than a lot of my peers in the
09:46 - group even in the developer community
09:48 - you know and I was doing a lot of coding
09:50 - I would be ahead of so many developers I
09:54 - would have more projects to show I was
09:56 - already making a higher income but I
09:59 - wouldn't spend time trying to show off
10:01 - in front of them I would just listen to
10:03 - what the instructor would say or I would
10:05 - listen to what the mentor would say and
10:07 - I would act like I was a smallest guy in
10:10 - the room and I'd be like okay him take
10:12 - notes everybody thought that I was
10:14 - either an idiot or I was slow or I was
10:16 - the least successful quite the contrary
10:19 - I was just spending all that time
10:20 - executing and not worrying about how I
10:22 - came off to other people so remember
10:25 - don't hurt your little brain number
10:28 - seven be religious to profit Bader's
10:32 - cool Ian says revenue feeds the ego
10:36 - profit feeds the family know your
10:40 - monthly expenses every single month and
10:43 - go after things that actually make you
10:46 - revenue and ultimately a profit if you
10:50 - can to X your income and it requires you
10:52 - to do a complete 180 from your current
10:55 - plan
10:55 - don't be religious to your plan or to
10:59 - your process be religious to the clients
11:02 - results to what you are offering to the
11:05 - other person sometimes the biggest value
11:08 - I've provided to the people that hired
11:12 - me to actually help them in their coding
11:14 - has actually been I've provided value in
11:17 - their life somehow even above and beyond
11:21 - coding I would always look for ways on
11:24 - what I can actually do better and how I
11:27 - can help them better like one of the
11:30 - clients I've worked with I helped him
11:32 - land a hundred thousand dollars a year
11:34 - contract from a pharmaceutical company
11:40 - right like a hospital so what does that
11:45 - have to do with me talking to him about
11:48 - coding or anything else it does it but I
11:51 - look for where I could provide value and
11:53 - wherever I could provide value I jumped
11:56 - I only care about where I can make a
11:58 - profound impact in my client's life and
12:01 - not what they hired me to do a lot of
12:05 - developers just [ __ ] themselves up even
12:07 - developers I would hire to help me when
12:10 - I was learning they were so religious to
12:12 - their process they're just like nope
12:13 - can't do that language no I cannot do
12:17 - JavaScript I'm just a Python developer
12:19 - even the 30 years of experience they
12:21 - could have picked up JavaScript a lot
12:23 - faster than me and actually taught me as
12:25 - I went through my book or gave me a
12:28 - project or put me on a path or gave me
12:29 - some strategic guidance be religious to
12:33 - profit my friend number eight have a
12:35 - winner
12:36 - attitude this means no bitching no drama
12:39 - no whining no complaining strictly
12:43 - positive attitude so many people spend
12:46 - so much time blaming people having a
12:48 - negative mindset if you have a positive
12:51 - mindset and you just stick through with
12:53 - it difficult things like sitting there
12:56 - trying to code all day and create a
12:58 - project you'll be able to burst through
13:01 - that because at the end of the day
13:02 - you'll just focus on the work that's
13:04 - required and not on all of this happens
13:09 - to me I don't even have time I'm so
13:11 - tired
13:12 - I have no energy how am I gonna be able
13:14 - to do this what's gonna happen in my
13:16 - life
13:17 - [ __ ] that just get it done okay that's
13:20 - it ain't nothing to it
13:22 - to do it thousand commitment Club you
13:26 - can be 100% committed you need to be
13:28 - thousand percent committed to becoming a
13:32 - developer or to becoming a business
13:34 - owner whatever your goal may be if you
13:36 - are flaky and trying to half-ass
13:39 - [ __ ] your own goal that's what your
13:43 - money will do to you you will open up
13:45 - your wallet and you'll be like that's
13:47 - weird my money seems to keep flaking on
13:49 - me show up 1000% for what it is that you
13:56 - do when you decide to do it number 10
13:59 - producer reorientation so I want you to
14:04 - reorient your mind like a producer you
14:09 - know why here's why majority of the
14:13 - people in the world are consumers
14:16 - majority of the people in the world also
14:19 - happened to be broke minority of the
14:24 - world is producers and minority of the
14:27 - people also happened to be wealthy be
14:31 - the 1% be a producer produce one
14:35 - valuable thing every day when you think
14:38 - of consuming and watching stuff think of
14:41 - yourself like you're stealing are you
14:45 - okay with stealing every single day
14:46 - you're taking somebody's stuff and
14:48 - you're just stealing you're sitting
14:49 - there and consuming it and that's all
14:52 - but as a producer you actually provide
14:54 - to the world as the value follows the
14:59 - money follows provide value produce and
15:03 - get in the habit of it make it something
15:04 - more than you produce to get money back
15:07 - make it something that's it's your habit
15:09 - and that's what you just do every single
15:12 - day number eleven accountability and
15:16 - tracking measure and track everything on
15:21 - a daily basis that is important to you I
15:23 - have Excel spreadsheet that I used
15:26 - inspired by Sam ovens and I track my
15:28 - sleep my calories my net worth my income
15:34 - my expenses
15:38 - notes for the day my productivity level
15:43 - all of these things I track every single
15:46 - day day in and day out and then the
15:50 - second step which is important is the
15:52 - accountability I get on a call with one
15:54 - of my closest friends Tenzin the founder
15:56 - of what's dev and we help each other and
15:59 - I ought in his sheet and he ought it's
16:02 - mine
16:03 - and because I respect him and care for
16:07 - him and admire him I don't [ __ ] with
16:11 - him and he doesn't [ __ ] with me and
16:12 - we keep it real and we keep each other
16:14 - on track every single day and we care
16:17 - about each other's goals so for yourself
16:20 - do the same thing a great analogy of how
16:24 - your daily decisions impact your life I
16:27 - found from DJ from MJ DeMarco from
16:31 - Millionaire Fastlane and he says think
16:34 - about your trajectory in life like a
16:36 - golf ball when you take a swing to hit
16:39 - the golf ball if there's a little change
16:42 - in your angle in the degree it won't
16:45 - show much of a difference if you took
16:47 - two strokes and in one you were you hit
16:50 - it at like 45 degree angle and another
16:53 - one you hit it like 75 degree angle in
16:56 - the start as the ball starts to take off
16:59 - the difference between the two hits
17:01 - won't be that much right the two balls
17:03 - will be really close but as it starts to
17:06 - get farther and farther you will see a
17:08 - monumental and exponential difference in
17:11 - the trajectory this is how he says life
17:15 - is if you are 25 today and you start
17:19 - making decisions at a very small level
17:22 - you won't even see a change in your life
17:24 - for example reaching out to 30 people
17:25 - per day trying to get an internship or a
17:30 - freelancing job as a developer by the
17:33 - time you get to 35 you will see the
17:35 - dramatic impact it has made it in your
17:38 - life versus if you chose to never ever
17:41 - ever do that accountability and tracking
17:47 - is one of the most important
17:49 - and it will change the trajectory of
17:51 - your life one percent every single day
17:54 - number 12 I want you to read this every
17:58 - single day I want you to frame this on
18:01 - your wall and I have provided a document
18:04 - written in Google Docs or something like
18:06 - that below this video I want you to
18:08 - screenshot that and actually make it a
18:11 - cover on your phone if you want $20,000
18:16 - a months or more type of results
18:19 - increasing your income more impact then
18:23 - none of this is optional you need to be
18:26 - doing this on a daily basis if you want
18:28 - to grow as fast as you possibly can
18:31 - these are all things that optimize you
18:34 - as a human being these are not tactics
18:35 - these are not little frameworks these
18:38 - are actually things that change your
18:40 - entire energy and your entire being and
18:43 - the trajectory of your life that's it
18:46 - and to end it here's what I'll leave you
18:51 - with failure is a sweat of success and
18:53 - got-damn I'm soaking wet MJ DeMarco
