00:00 - hey guys what's up this is ky from
00:03 - clever
00:04 - program.com and I I want to talk with
00:06 - you guys about the power of investing in
00:09 - yourself and what can it do for you and
00:12 - how it can actually make you a better
00:14 - computer programmer or a software
00:17 - developer now there are a lot of people
00:20 - that I you know talk to and and see who
00:24 - are trying to learn and and are really
00:27 - struggling with a lot of things but you
00:29 - know they have good intentions their
00:31 - intentions that they very core are
00:33 - genuine they want to work hard they want
00:36 - to improve they want to get
00:38 - better but most people um never want to
00:44 - spend anything to learn
00:47 - something like so many people are so
00:50 - interested in you know they they're they
00:52 - always want to buy something they'll
00:54 - spend on buying new shoes they'll spend
00:56 - on buying new clothes they'll buy suits
01:00 - they will buy any kind of Technology you
01:02 - know if you're interested in soccer you
01:04 - might buy a soccer ball or a
01:06 - basketball and people are always you
01:11 - know we we love buying stuff right we
01:13 - love I love to buy new things and get
01:15 - new things but when people want to
01:17 - accelerate their learning and get better
01:19 - and get better results people hesitate
01:22 - on buying a
01:25 - book A book that's worth maybe 10 20 $30
01:29 - right
01:30 - but it has the potential to change your
01:34 - life that's honestly how I think of
01:37 - anytime I I can see a way to further my
01:40 - education right it has anything that you
01:43 - invest in that's in yourself that can
01:45 - actually improve
01:47 - you that has the that has potential the
01:50 - power to change your entire life and
01:52 - people are always trying to Short Change
01:54 - themselves in that regard they want to
01:57 - spend money when it comes to buy buying
02:00 - new things but they hesitate and those
02:02 - new things aren't an investment in
02:05 - themselves they're are investment that
02:07 - is that is superficial and it's okay
02:09 - right invest right like um I I bought
02:12 - this watch I love this watch really cool
02:15 - watch
02:17 - but I I this is something that I was you
02:19 - know thinking about should I get it
02:21 - should I not get it but I ended end
02:22 - ultimately ended up getting it right but
02:25 - when it comes to getting improving your
02:28 - education improving the quality of your
02:31 - learning skills people will be very
02:34 - hesitant in
02:37 - spending people are just always thinking
02:40 - about so what's my point my point is
02:45 - stop being hesitant when it comes to
02:47 - investing in yourself because that's the
02:48 - most important investment you can make
02:51 - and anytime that you invest in yourself
02:54 - you'll see benefits that are not just
02:56 - twofold or three-fold they'll literally
02:58 - be like tenfold or more something that
03:00 - you can't even
03:03 - quantitatively
03:06 - measure okay so that time that it takes
03:10 - you to think about buying that new book
03:13 - that you have in your mind or purchasing
03:15 - that course that could potentially teach
03:17 - you something
03:18 - new you should have spent that time
03:21 - actually purchasing it and then learning
03:23 - from
03:25 - it okay uh a lot of people are like hey
03:28 - I don't know if I should get a member
03:29 - ship to this site or I don't know if I
03:31 - should uh you know purchase this book
03:33 - well if you make that investment would
03:35 - it break your bank and they'll be like
03:37 - no well then do it and test it out and
03:40 - try it out if then after you've invested
03:43 - in it and it's not giving you the
03:44 - benefit that you wanted and it's not
03:46 - having any impact on your life a lot of
03:48 - these things even have 30-day returns so
03:50 - you can just return them and they'll
03:52 - give you your money
03:53 - back but ultimately my point is you
03:56 - shouldn't be afraid to invest in
03:57 - yourself people will all the time you'll
03:59 - buy buy chips you'll buy random stuff
04:01 - you'll buy cookies but really you're not
04:04 - going to buy an ebook for five
04:06 - bucks you're not going to buy you know
04:09 - uh a $2 app that could teach you about
04:11 - computer programming and help
04:13 - you
04:15 - so it it's really a paradigm shift that
04:18 - I'm suggesting that you should think
04:20 - about and that should you should try to
04:23 - implement it's a different way of
04:25 - looking at things but if you value
04:28 - knowledge
04:30 - you will be very
04:33 - knowledgeable that's it guys this is
04:36 - kazzy I'm signing out but here are some
