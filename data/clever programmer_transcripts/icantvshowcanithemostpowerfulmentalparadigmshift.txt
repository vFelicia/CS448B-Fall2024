00:00 - hey guys what's up this is kazy from
00:02 - clever program.com so I got an email and
00:06 - kind of bugged me I wanted to jump on
00:08 - and talk with you guys about it like I'm
00:10 - recording actually I'm in the middle of
00:11 - recording my sequel course that I'm
00:13 - making for you guys but it I think it's
00:17 - important so I wanted to just jump at it
00:19 - and and talk with you guys about it
00:21 - right away while it was like kind of um
00:24 - while the iron is still hot so to
00:26 - speak so so this kid just emailed me you
00:29 - know like
00:30 - I I he he goes I I can't take your
00:32 - course I can't afford it I'm a broke
00:35 - 13-year-old um and so I I replied back
00:38 - to him and I said uh okay that's I won't
00:40 - let you actually even buy my course
00:42 - because I I know most of you like most
00:44 - students who are young don't have the
00:46 - money and I don't want you to go in debt
00:48 - trying to pay for the course cuz how are
00:51 - you going to actually learn if you're
00:53 - worrying about having to pay but what I
00:57 - did tell him is I hate words like I
01:00 - can't right and that's what a lot of
01:03 - people always say whether it's try them
01:05 - trying to get an apartment or a car or
01:07 - uh trying to hire somebody or trying to
01:12 - I don't know whatever it is that you're
01:13 - trying to do in life go out and play
01:15 - pool or that's that's what I've been
01:18 - doing recently so I always say pool um
01:21 - go out to a bar with friends and buy
01:23 - drinks whatever it
01:25 - is using words like can't just handicaps
01:29 - you
01:31 - because like what what do you mean you
01:33 - can't right so I responded to him I said
01:36 - don't use words like can't how about how
01:39 - about teach people programming and you
01:42 - can charge people who who want to learn
01:44 - programming for you at your at your
01:46 - school or anywhere near you how about uh
01:50 - sell something that you don't need like
01:52 - when I was younger I would sell my video
01:54 - games or I don't know sell sell some
01:57 - stupid hacky sack that I had and some
01:59 - things some of those things would be $3
02:01 - some of those things would be $5 $10
02:03 - whatever and it started to add up and I
02:06 - was able to afford things without having
02:08 - to ask my parents because I don't know I
02:10 - I personally always just hated the idea
02:12 - of entitlement I personally always hated
02:15 - just asking for money um or or anything
02:19 - really I just thought like it should
02:20 - really be earned so you know if you want
02:24 - to do that if you have the ego you know
02:26 - you have the ego to not ask your parents
02:28 - or anybody for help like that's good but
02:30 - then also don't just handicap Yourself
02:33 - by saying things like you can't you know
02:35 - I I just never understand what that word
02:38 - means like you know and I told him that
02:41 - and then he responded back and he said I
02:44 - wish people at my school wanted to learn
02:48 - but all of them hate programming and so
02:51 - then I said okay so just go somewhere
02:55 - where people don't hate programming
02:57 - actually want to learn and then or you
03:00 - know then you can charge them and teach
03:02 - them because that's what they need help
03:04 - with so that's really the answer now I'm
03:08 - assuming the next thing he's going to
03:10 - say is but I don't know where to find
03:12 - people and then he's going to stop at
03:13 - that well how about go a little bit
03:15 - further and actually start looking
03:18 - actively where you can find people like
03:20 - that who need your help it always just
03:23 - gets to you get an objection then
03:26 - question it then go deeper then you get
03:27 - an objection then question it then go
03:29 - deeper till get to the heart of it and
03:30 - you'll realize most of the times the
03:32 - answer is a lot simpler than you guys
03:34 - make it out to be you guys just shut
03:36 - your brains down to a a possible
03:38 - solution and I'm sorry I'm not saying
03:40 - you guys I do this thing more than
03:43 - anybody else so I should be the first
03:44 - one to blame I'm just a little bit
03:46 - passionate about it I'm sorry for my
03:48 - energy on this question um but that's
03:50 - just how I feel it's something that
03:53 - resonates with me cuz I think I have
03:55 - been in that kid's boat for a long time
03:57 - and that's why I'm I'm having this
03:59 - reaction to reading that like when I was
04:02 - 12 years old I remember uh we were
04:05 - trying to get this game called Command
04:06 - and Conquer General zero hour and I
04:09 - don't know if I should say this but we
04:11 - were trying to download it bit torrent
04:14 - um and we got the like back in those
04:18 - days the internet sucked internet was
04:20 - complete crap like it was really bad so
04:24 - when you had to download something it
04:26 - would take you months to download
04:28 - something like now if I tried to
04:30 - download something it would be very
04:31 - quick also now I don't use bit torrent
04:33 - because I started my own business and I
04:36 - know how much it would hurt me if nobody
04:39 - paid me and went around it so out of
04:41 - that respect and also I want these
04:43 - companies to do better so then they can
04:46 - make better updates and I can use their
04:49 - software in a better way then I also get
04:51 - customer support and whatever
04:54 - so uh whatever useless tangent going
04:57 - back to the story I got the game command
05:01 - conqueror oh no I'm sorry we didn't get
05:02 - the game we didn't pay for it we wanted
05:05 - to just download it okay it was me and
05:07 - two of my brothers and they were adults
05:09 - at this point okay we had the money we
05:12 - had the money like nobody doesn't have
05:16 - $50 especially if you're in United
05:18 - States okay but we just wouldn't buy
05:21 - that game and we never thought about how
05:23 - we could earn that money to buy that
05:25 - game we never came up we never
05:27 - brainstormed those Solutions but we
05:29 - brain stormed how can we save and how
05:32 - can we like hack it and go online and
05:35 - all these crazy places and download a
05:37 - crack from here and download a key
05:39 - Keegan generator from here and make it
05:41 - all work and make the dll files work and
05:45 - really went through crazy pain waited
05:47 - over 1 and a half month to get the game
05:51 - and the game that I was probably most
05:52 - passionate about in my entire life once
05:54 - I got it I didn't even
05:57 - care I did not even care like I had lost
06:01 - my passion for it
06:05 - so
06:06 - guys I like if you're going to take
06:09 - something away from this just please
06:11 - like don't use words like I
06:14 - wish because you can and you don't have
06:18 - to wish and you don't have to dream you
06:20 - don't have to live in a fairy tale land
06:23 - whatever it is that you got to get or
06:25 - you
06:26 - want you know you don't have have to
06:29 - sacrifice your child's education because
06:33 - you think you can't afford it if you
06:35 - just stop for if you just turn that
06:39 - switch off for a second the can't the
06:40 - word the can't and you just go deeper
06:44 - and instead of going I can't afford it
06:46 - to how can I afford it you'll be able to
06:51 - take your child to a better school where
06:53 - they can get a higher quality education
06:55 - you'll be able to take yourself out to a
06:58 - party spend
07:01 - lavishly have a good
07:03 - time um I don't know whatever whatever
07:06 - things are important to you guys you'll
07:08 - be able to do a lot of them without
07:10 - having to hold back in everything in
07:12 - life like I I would go to college I
07:14 - would go to UIC and a lot of my friends
07:18 - they wouldn't even like I liked playing
07:20 - pool I liked going bowling there I liked
07:23 - eating there I liked going to the gym
07:25 - there but they couldn't come to play
07:26 - pool with me because they didn't have
07:29 - the money and they never thought to
07:31 - themselves how can I make more money
07:33 - they just would say I don't have the
07:34 - money I can't afford it and when I would
07:36 - tell them how you can make more money
07:37 - they would just shut me out like for
07:39 - whatever
07:41 - reason um and some of us would go to
07:44 - play pool uh but the only friends who
07:47 - were coming to do that were the ones who
07:49 - already had a job or whatever then
07:51 - another thing that they would have
07:52 - difficulty with is if we try to go to
07:54 - the gym cuz they're not paying for the
07:55 - gym membership and because they don't
07:58 - want to spend money to eat there so it's
08:01 - like all these constraints and all these
08:04 - things that they're kind of just giving
08:06 - away in their life
08:08 - and I don't know that's
08:12 - just like I I I don't know I just don't
08:14 - think it's the right way and he actually
08:16 - just responded he said I'm Pro I'm
08:19 - reading it live so I don't know how this
08:20 - is going to go or what I'm going to say
08:22 - but finding someone at my school that
08:24 - wants to learn how to program is hard I
08:26 - know some year 10 I know some year 10
08:29 - students that want to learn programming
08:31 - but I'm really shy and they most likely
08:33 - won't pay me also I'm still learning
08:35 - Python and don't know what to teach if I
08:36 - find someone that wants to learn okay
08:40 - now we're getting somewhere let's talk
08:41 - about it I love it I love it learning
08:44 - okay now we're getting somewhere he says
08:46 - he's shy and they most likely won't pay
08:49 - him so a little little bit of it is now
08:52 - about self-esteem okay so shy and they
08:56 - most likely won't pay
08:57 - me um I don't don't know what to teach
08:59 - that's an imposter syndrome I've talked
09:01 - with you guys about it so a lot of
09:04 - people have that um I don't know what to
09:06 - teach I don't know if I'm an expert can
09:08 - I teach it guys I'm right here I'm I'm
09:12 - the living example of this the living
09:16 - example I
09:18 - am I don't have 30 years of experience I
09:21 - don't have 20 years of experience I
09:22 - haven't worked with Google I haven't
09:24 - worked with Microsoft but I am here I
09:28 - help you guys out
09:29 - I I am able to make you guys learn fast
09:32 - enough and that's good enough for me and
09:34 - that's good enough for
09:37 - you so for him it it's the same way he
09:41 - doesn't need to be the ultimate
09:43 - expert right like he could teach
09:46 - somebody who's just a little bit behind
09:48 - him now it's the the fact of finding
09:51 - that person but his other objections I'm
09:53 - shy and they most likely won't pay me
09:55 - okay
09:58 - so that that's another one of those
09:59 - things that happens to people they just
10:01 - think that they shouldn't be paid or
10:03 - they don't deserve to be paid enough or
10:04 - they're shy and they just have these
10:06 - presumptions that people won't pay them
10:09 - look again if somebody has a pain and
10:14 - you're a if you have pain you're getting
10:17 - a headache you might go to the far CVS
10:19 - Pharmacy and buy Advil
10:22 - right just like that somebody is
10:25 - actually having trouble and you can
10:27 - actually legitimately help them
10:31 - right well why wouldn't they pay you
10:35 - like like if they don't have money okay
10:37 - I understand but it makes sense if if
10:41 - they really want if they want to learn
10:43 - and you can help them like they'll pay
10:45 - you right
10:47 - so that's again one of those things
10:50 - and shy and most like like that's
10:53 - something I want to talk with you guys
10:55 - about more this video is getting longer
10:57 - maybe I'll just stop it here because I'm
10:59 - going to go back to making the sequel
11:01 - course but this part kind of irks me shy
11:04 - and most likely won't pay me
11:07 - like it it really comes down to the
11:10 - psychological aspect of it even even
11:13 - with jobs when they give you a choice to
11:15 - ask for money and ask for more money
11:18 - like people are actually physically they
11:20 - have pain uh they did some study and
11:24 - they found out that the physical pain
11:27 - that you
11:27 - have uh when you get a lot of emotional
11:31 - pain the same pain center in your brain
11:34 - the one that detects physical pain and
11:35 - gives you alarm that same thing kind of
11:38 - goes off in your brain so some people
11:42 - when they're asking for money or trying
11:43 - to charge they go through that and they
11:45 - have that pain so when they ask people
11:47 - how much do you want us to pay you most
11:49 - of the times most of the people will
11:52 - automatically give a much much much much
11:54 - lower price than what's
11:57 - expected so
12:00 - understand that you know like if you
12:02 - understand what you're worth and how you
12:03 - can help other people and how much help
12:06 - they're getting from you put yourself in
12:08 - their shoes and imagine if I was getting
12:11 - this much help I would be willing to pay
12:16 - so now that I'm helping this person
12:18 - doesn't it make sense that I should be
12:20 - paid for what I
12:21 - do I mean people make caricatures for
12:25 - people charging $300 an hour $250 an
12:28 - hour those people just are hobbyist like
12:30 - one thing I want you guys to do is
12:32 - really brainstorm and think about all
12:33 - the things that you pay for all the
12:35 - services all the maybe magazines
12:38 - subscriptions Netflix like are those
12:40 - things really that useful like is
12:42 - Netflix really that useful you still pay
12:44 - for it does it it gives you enjoyment so
12:48 - it solves a problem right that's why you
12:49 - pay for it in this case it solves
12:52 - somebody's problem of learning and
12:54 - that's why they pay for it right
12:57 - so yeah
13:00 - um I'm probably going to continue having
13:01 - a discussion with my good friend
13:05 - here um
13:07 - and and yeah okay guys thank you guys
13:11 - for watching I am going to stop this and
13:15 - I will go back to making the sequel
13:16 - sequel course which you should go check
13:18 - out because it's going to be awesome all
13:20 - right guys I love you guys so much thank
13:22 - you for watching I'll see you in the
13:24 - next video
