00:00 - your problem isn't JavaScript it's not a
00:03 - coding language it's not python it's not
00:07 - react
00:08 - it's not a new framework that's out
00:10 - there none of those are your problems
00:13 - you like all this time I've been telling
00:16 - you to master JavaScript Master react
00:19 - master the basics Master the
00:21 - fundamentals master all this stuff
00:23 - but the real problem is none of those
00:25 - things the real problem is actually your
00:28 - lack of Mastery of your own self what I
00:32 - mean by this
00:34 - how are you going to master JavaScript
00:37 - when you can't master the fact that you
00:40 - can put a two hour time on your calendar
00:42 - and just commit to it and actually do it
00:46 - how are you going to become better at
00:47 - react if you can get yourself to sleep
00:50 - early so you're not exhausted the next
00:53 - day so that when you come to code you
00:55 - just quit because you can't do it
00:58 - anymore
00:59 - right so those are the things that you
01:01 - have to think about it's not just
01:03 - sitting there and coding that's one very
01:06 - small technical aspect that yes you need
01:09 - to actually improve but what we're
01:12 - talking about here guys is your Mastery
01:14 - of self your own skills your brain your
01:17 - own energy are you sleeping on time if
01:21 - you're not sleeping on time and you
01:22 - can't get yourself to sleep on time
01:24 - then you're waking up tired if you're
01:26 - waking up tired and you're waking up
01:28 - exhausted
01:29 - you're already going to your job or
01:31 - you're going to your school or wherever
01:32 - you're going
01:33 - and then you're coming back to code and
01:35 - you're exhausted no wonder you don't
01:37 - like coding no wonder it's so hard for
01:40 - you no wonder you're not making the
01:42 - progress that you've been wanting to
01:44 - make over a prolonged period of time and
01:46 - why you're stuck and why you feel like
01:48 - you might even be stuck in tutorial hell
01:50 - it's very simple
01:53 - you have to master your own self
01:56 - okay start off with simple things can
01:58 - you go to sleep on time
02:01 - when you wake up can you wake up on the
02:03 - time that you said you're gonna wake up
02:05 - when you go to maybe you maybe you know
02:07 - physical part is very important guys
02:09 - like I know on this channel I don't talk
02:11 - a lot about physical stuff but
02:13 - that part is very important to get your
02:14 - mind right
02:16 - to put your mind in an optimal state for
02:18 - you to not be tired it's directly
02:20 - connected to your brain like your phys
02:23 - this is why we're physiological
02:25 - creatures right physicality and
02:27 - psychology they both work they're
02:29 - intertwined for example if I told you to
02:33 - think calmly
02:35 - you could probably do that right now but
02:37 - what if I took you and made you run at
02:40 - full Sprint speed for one to two or
02:42 - three minutes up a hill
02:44 - and then I told you to think calmly with
02:45 - your heart rate at 200 beats per minute
02:47 - now you won't be able to think calmly
02:50 - why because I've changed your physiology
02:53 - something physical and now something
02:54 - psychological has happened something in
02:56 - your brain has changed so you think at a
02:58 - different level okay so this is why this
03:01 - is important for you to actually take
03:02 - into your mind so can you sleep on time
03:04 - can you go work out and take care of
03:06 - your health basic things because if
03:09 - you're fat and you have diseases you're
03:11 - just gonna die early so that means
03:13 - you're not going to be able to make as
03:14 - much money in your coding career let's
03:15 - just say your ultimate goal is to become
03:18 - a software developer that's amazing work
03:20 - for 20 30 40 years maximize the amount
03:22 - of money and then you retire right
03:24 - but what if like you die at 50 or 60
03:27 - because you have arthritis you have
03:29 - diabetes you've developed uh obesity you
03:33 - have
03:33 - um
03:34 - breathing problems you have blood
03:37 - pressure problems you suffer from a
03:39 - stroke
03:40 - if all of those things happen well guess
03:42 - what I'm actually going to be a better
03:43 - developer because I'm going to be able
03:45 - to work longer I'm going to be able to
03:46 - learn the new Frameworks while you might
03:48 - not even be alive
03:50 - okay so I know all these things sound
03:53 - like fun and like oh my God like it's
03:55 - just a house thing I don't really need
03:57 - to worry about health like how does that
03:59 - coding thing cause you like tell me
04:01 - about code
04:02 - I am telling you about code
04:05 - this is directly related to coding if
04:09 - you're dead you can't code
04:11 - okay let me explain that again if you're
04:14 - dead you can't code there's nothing to
04:16 - code you're dead
04:18 - so my priority and my job for you is to
04:22 - make sure that you become
04:24 - the best version of you and you also
04:27 - become a great developer and for that I
04:29 - have to make sure that your mind is
04:31 - right and I have to make sure your body
04:33 - is right
04:34 - and then I have to make sure your coding
04:36 - skills are right
04:37 - but your whole thing with I've been
04:39 - trying to get myself to code for years
04:41 - and months that's so many people's
04:43 - stories
04:44 - that used to be my story too I've been
04:46 - trying to get myself to code and I just
04:48 - keep quitting and then I come back into
04:50 - and it's so fun and I quit but I but I
04:52 - commit to coding tomorrow I commit to
04:54 - coding this upcoming week and then you
04:57 - don't do it you commit but then you
04:59 - don't follow through
05:01 - it's just a lack of Mastery of your own
05:03 - self you can't get yourself to do the
05:06 - things that you said you're going to do
05:07 - so we can't even talk about JavaScript
05:10 - guys we can't even talk about react we
05:12 - can't we can't even talk about the
05:14 - command line or The Terminal or learning
05:17 - new Frameworks or learning new libraries
05:19 - or your GitHub repo or your portfolio
05:21 - your LinkedIn or your resume we can't
05:23 - talk about that because you can't get
05:25 - yourself to do stuff if I got you a job
05:27 - today you won't even be able to show up
05:29 - on time for like a month in a row
05:33 - you're gonna get fired
05:35 - so
05:36 - we have to get the basics right we have
05:39 - to start with the brain we have to start
05:41 - with the body we just have to start
05:42 - there okay so can you just start off
05:45 - with simple stuff like hey sleep early
05:47 - and sleep on time because your memory
05:51 - isn't very important part of the puzzle
05:52 - when it comes to you becoming a software
05:54 - developer it's an extremely important
05:56 - part of the puzzle if your brain isn't
05:58 - working you're not remembering the
05:59 - functions that you learned yesterday
06:00 - you're not remembering the algorithms
06:02 - you figured out yesterday your brain
06:04 - isn't working in overdrive to come up
06:06 - with the connections the solutions to
06:08 - the problems that you're facing you're
06:10 - going to be stuck
06:12 - so you need to first get your mind right
06:16 - okay so sleep early
06:18 - then tomorrow can you go work out and if
06:20 - you can't work out and you haven't
06:21 - worked out go for a walk go for a walk
06:24 - how about that go for a long walk okay
06:26 - walk for 20 minutes walk for 10 20
06:28 - minutes just start with that something
06:30 - simple then come back and get yourself
06:32 - to code okay start with simple steps
06:36 - but really A lot of it is just the lack
06:39 - of self-mastery like not being able to
06:41 - get yourself to do what you're what you
06:43 - say you're gonna do
06:45 - okay it's it creates dishonesty and you
06:48 - start creating dishonesty in yourself
06:50 - and honestly even on my team I'm sick of
06:52 - people that are dishonest I don't even
06:53 - I'm not even I'm literally choosing to
06:56 - not even work with the people anymore
06:57 - who have you know a level of dishonesty
07:00 - and a level of low Integrity the reason
07:03 - is because it's like poison
07:05 - if I let that be around me it's gonna
07:07 - poison me and so it doesn't matter how
07:09 - talented somebody is or how skill
07:11 - somebody is if they're not honest with
07:13 - themselves and they lack Integrity with
07:15 - themselves I can't have them around me
07:18 - it doesn't matter how long they've
07:19 - worked with me none of that matters
07:21 - because ultimately they're not just
07:23 - failing me they're ultimately failing
07:24 - themselves and I can't have that right
07:26 - if I need it to be a lesson for them to
07:29 - be able to hold themselves accountable
07:31 - to make themselves in integrity
07:35 - then I'm gonna do that for them okay so
07:38 - that's what you need to do for yourself
07:40 - and I I promise you I was never like
07:43 - this for a long time it was not like
07:45 - this okay but even right now when I'm
07:48 - going from being a couch potato to
07:49 - running a marathon I had to do it
07:51 - through a lot of discipline it doesn't
07:53 - matter how I feel I wake up tomorrow and
07:55 - I go and I run now I'm training Muay
07:58 - Thai for 100 days it doesn't matter I go
08:00 - five days a week to train it's
08:01 - incredibly hard to train I wake up at 4
08:04 - 30 A.M
08:05 - I'm at the gym at five I train for two
08:07 - hours until like 7 A.M then I go and
08:10 - have a lifting session then I go do that
08:12 - then I come here and then I shoot these
08:14 - videos and then I not only shoot these
08:16 - videos but then I work for 10 to 12
08:17 - hours each day then around 8 P.M I go to
08:20 - sleep and then I rinse and repeat and I
08:22 - do that every single day but because I
08:24 - care about my body I also have my meals
08:26 - planned for two and five PM so my macros
08:28 - are perfectly on point so I'm eating
08:30 - clean I have high amount of protein
08:33 - all of that
08:35 - that's what you need to bring to your
08:37 - own life okay don't just think of
08:39 - yourself as like this one little thing
08:41 - that you're doing I'm just doing coding
08:42 - so I'm just going to do an app but in
08:43 - the process it doesn't matter I'll get
08:45 - fat all of this stuff you know we I have
08:48 - David on my team I love David okay uh
08:51 - he's a lot of times he edits our videos
08:53 - you guys know I mean he done did our
08:55 - Merin stack tutorial
08:57 - but he started doing all this coding
09:00 - stuff on our team and he started gaining
09:01 - all this weight and he got fat and so
09:04 - you know I'm even talking to him and I'm
09:07 - like bro what is going on and so now
09:09 - that we're here in Colombia we have the
09:11 - whole team here I just got him on a
09:13 - crazy diet which you know and he's been
09:16 - cutting weight he's lost like seven or
09:17 - eight pounds in the last few weeks and
09:19 - he's literally like dude I can breathe
09:21 - better now he's like I had this fat
09:23 - person breath breathing where I couldn't
09:25 - breathe properly
09:28 - and now he can breathe better
09:30 - don't you think that's going to help him
09:32 - with coding imagine you're sitting there
09:35 - you're frustrated you're trying to work
09:36 - on a problem and you literally can't
09:38 - breathe right
09:41 - right if you can't breathe right do you
09:43 - think it's gonna help you or hurt you
09:45 - when you're trying to solve a coding
09:46 - problem
09:46 - who do you think is going to be able to
09:48 - sit there longer in code me or somebody
09:51 - else who's even in a better shape okay
09:54 - if you look at Magnus Carlson who's the
09:56 - number one chess player in the world
10:01 - he's fit he's incredibly fit
10:04 - you would say wait it's a game of mine
10:06 - you literally do nothing you're just
10:07 - sitting there on a chessboard playing
10:09 - like why does he need to be actually fit
10:10 - for that
10:12 - that's the thing that's my point you
10:14 - actually need to be incredibly
10:15 - physically fit for being a good chess
10:18 - player Bobby Fisher who you might have
10:20 - heard of he was incredibly fit he was a
10:22 - great swimmer
10:23 - because in order to be able to sit there
10:25 - over the board for six or eight hours
10:27 - and focus with with great intensity and
10:29 - produce great ideas you actually need to
10:33 - be really fit
10:36 - that's just the truth it's just the case
10:38 - the world champions were like that okay
10:40 - so I want you to focus on that okay I
10:43 - want you to focus on living a fulfilling
10:45 - life my purpose isn't just to make you
10:47 - the greatest coder ever my purpose here
10:49 - is to make you the best version of you
10:51 - possible okay so that in 10 30 50 60
10:56 - years you're somebody who you respect
10:58 - you're somebody who you admire you're
11:01 - somebody who you want to be around and
11:03 - you're somebody who's alive a lot of you
11:06 - want to get married you want to have
11:07 - kids well would you not want to be in a
11:10 - fit condition to be able to play with
11:12 - them
11:14 - right if you have if you are the one who
11:16 - develops all these problems and diseases
11:17 - and health problems in a relationship it
11:20 - sucks for your partner
11:21 - that [ __ ] sucks for your partner because
11:23 - then they're there and have to take care
11:25 - of you over a prolonged period of time
11:26 - take you to the hospital take you to the
11:27 - doctors I knew because I I grew up like
11:30 - that I had to do that for my pen I had
11:32 - to do that for my mom because she wasn't
11:33 - in a good health and then there are all
11:36 - these things that come with it and you
11:37 - have to become you have to take on a
11:38 - role of a caretaker and so this is
11:41 - beyond coding this is beyond JavaScript
11:44 - this is your life so I need you to
11:46 - understand this I need you to really
11:47 - take it seriously and do it with a lot
11:50 - of love and passion
11:52 - self-mastery is the first place get
11:54 - yourself to sleep on time get yourself
11:56 - to eat good foods get yourself to go on
11:59 - walks to start thinking better your
12:02 - stress levels will be lower then when
12:04 - you'll be coding you'll be able to code
12:05 - better for longer you'll enjoy coding
12:08 - because you're not going to be just
12:09 - stressed all the time while trying to
12:10 - code
12:11 - you're going to be like I handle so much
12:13 - stress on The Daily coding is actually
12:14 - not that much stress I can do it easily
12:16 - I can do it okay a lot of it is a
12:18 - mindset so
12:20 - start committing to doing something and
12:23 - you can put in the comments below it
12:25 - could be something simple like I'm gonna
12:26 - go for a walk right now I'm gonna go for
12:28 - a walk you know tonight at this time I'm
12:31 - gonna go for a walk tomorrow
12:32 - here's another thing I know okay this is
12:34 - funny it's okay but like the longer
12:37 - people put away the thing they're gonna
12:39 - do the less likely they are to do it so
12:40 - that's one of the things that I've
12:41 - learned when people are like
12:43 - you know if you tell somebody set a goal
12:45 - and then they're like oh yeah I'll set
12:46 - the goal for next week they're the least
12:48 - likely people to do it or they're like
12:50 - yes tomorrow at 8pm I'm gonna do it it's
12:52 - like what the [ __ ] are you doing right
12:53 - now you're clearly sitting here
12:56 - watching this [ __ ] video
12:58 - right so why can't you just go for a
13:01 - walk now Okay so
13:04 - I need you to put together a plan okay
13:07 - the long the farther away you put it the
13:10 - the more I know and you know the less
13:12 - likely you are to do it okay so put it
13:15 - as close to whenever you can as possible
13:18 - because if it's right now you could do
13:20 - it right now if it's in 20 minutes you
13:21 - could do it right uh in 20 minutes leave
13:23 - a comment below what you're going to be
13:25 - doing so it could be you're going to go
13:26 - for for a walk for 10 minutes it could
13:28 - be you get to sleep early at eight or
13:31 - nine pm tonight could be I'm gonna wake
13:32 - up at 5 00 a.m or 6 a.m or something or
13:35 - it could be I'm gonna go and code for 30
13:38 - minutes right now or I'm gonna go and
13:40 - code you know in the next hour whatever
13:43 - it is drop it below let everybody see
13:47 - the action that you're doing hold
13:48 - yourself publicly accountable and for
13:50 - all of you guys in the community when
13:51 - you see that go upload that person's
13:53 - comment don't just do it for yourself
13:54 - and be [ __ ] selfish help the other
13:56 - person is the community so go and upvote
13:59 - their comment reply to them let them
14:00 - know that you're cheering from them okay
14:02 - maybe even exchange information with
14:04 - these people okay like how about like
14:06 - you guys
14:07 - get on a WhatsApp or something okay give
14:09 - yourself like a WhatsApp number or I
14:12 - don't know some group like somebody can
14:14 - create a group in their Discord and be
14:15 - like hey join the Discord I don't care
14:17 - find a way to communicate with each
14:18 - other okay get connected with each other
14:20 - and hold each other accountable okay
14:22 - start with the WhatsApp number or
14:24 - something simple I just don't want it to
14:25 - be anything spammy right because
14:26 - sometimes there's spam accounts that
14:28 - show up oh message me on this WhatsApp
14:31 - and it's not clearly not me and you can
14:33 - see the username isn't me I'm glad
14:34 - YouTube came up with that username thing
14:37 - so there you have it
14:39 - stop worrying about mastering JavaScript
14:41 - or reacting English Frameworks Master
14:43 - yourself first
