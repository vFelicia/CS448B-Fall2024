00:00 - - This is one of my favorite parts
00:01 - where I get to take something I drew up
00:03 - on the whiteboard, actually
started in my brain.
00:06 - Then, I bring it over here, I code it up,
00:08 - and it starts turning it into reality.
00:10 - Hey you, in this video
00:12 - I wanna show you something very special
00:14 - that I did not find in other videos.
00:16 - One, I wanna show you the life
00:18 - of a Remote Developer/a Freelancer
00:21 - (upbeat techno music)
00:28 - I also am going to take
you behind the scenes
00:30 - and show you the idea from
its birth to its conception
00:35 - to it actually being
formed in reality in code,
00:38 - and then I also wanna show
you how I send invoices
00:42 - and some of my clients
00:43 - what my hourly rate I'm charging them,
00:46 - and what one weeks' invoice
might actually look like.
00:50 - On top of all these really
juicy and amazing things
00:53 - I'm also gonna show you
how I structure my day,
00:56 - and what my day looks like.
01:00 - Do I meet friends?
01:01 - How do I schedule time to actually work?
01:03 - When do I work?
01:05 - When do I wake up?
01:06 - These are all things you'll learn
01:08 - and this video will truly show you
01:11 - what your life as a
Developer can look like.
01:14 - Before we begin, the last thing
I want to tell you right now
01:17 - is at the end of this video
01:18 - I have a very special gift for you
01:20 - so you definitely don't
want to miss this video!
01:23 - With that said, let's jump right into it!
01:26 - (alarm clock blaring)
01:29 - Start my day off great, just
waking up a little happy
01:32 - as you can see there.
01:35 - Go get ready, brush my teeth,
01:38 - and then I like to jump straight into it.
01:40 - So, in the morning one of
the first things I like to do
01:43 - is check my emails, see if
my clients have messaged me,
01:47 - when they would like to
set-up a new meaning,
01:50 - and really plan out how I'm
going to work on my day.
01:53 - So, this is the time I take
to really plan out my day.
01:58 - And once my day is planned, I go at it,
02:00 - starting with a little bit of boxing.
02:02 - So, I like to get my body moving,
02:05 - and just kind of get into it.
02:11 - Now, the most important
thing for you to understand
02:14 - is that when you are putting in the input
02:16 - make sure that you
actually add the ratings
02:19 - because without the ratings
you really have nothing.
02:23 - You can focus on the benefits,
but ultimately what you need
02:26 - you really need...
02:27 - (voice fades out)
02:30 - A lot of the times when
I'm solving a problem,
02:32 - I'm usually white-boarding it.
02:34 - This is where it gets solved for me.
02:36 - It's almost never at the computer.
02:38 - It's me walking around and thinking about,
02:41 - "what is it that needs to be done
02:43 - for this problem to be solved?"
02:45 - And visually being able to see
it, really really helps me.
02:49 - So, this is a simplified version of it,
02:51 - but being able to look at,
02:53 - "Okay, I'm working with
Model-View-Templates"
02:56 - and for other languages
02:58 - that's usually Model-View-Controller,
02:59 - but I'm thinking,
03:01 - "Okay, how can we use
this to build the app
03:04 - that we're actually building?"
03:05 - This is why I have so many whiteboards,
03:07 - and for a lot of the people who get stuck
03:09 - just sitting there trying
to code their way through
03:11 - often times they're like, "Why
can't I solve this problem?"
03:14 - You're too close to it.
03:16 - So you need that time
to walk away and think,
03:18 - need some space.
03:20 - That's why this is a
programmer's best friend.
03:25 - And a lot of my days
are actually doing this.
03:27 - And I love it, the whole process
03:30 - of solving a problem,
03:32 - breaking it down into its component parts
03:34 - and really figuring out the solutions.
03:37 - One of the most beautiful
03:39 - and one of the most satisfying
things I get to do in my day.
03:56 - All right, now this is
one of my favorite parts
03:58 - where I get to take something
I drew up on the whiteboard
04:01 - actually started in my brain,
04:03 - then, I bring it over here, I code it up,
04:05 - and it starts turning it into reality.
04:07 - So, let me give you an example, all right?
04:08 - So, we like this movie "Skyfall".
04:11 - It's an awesome movie right?
04:12 - James Bond, who doesn't like him?
04:13 - Let's go to this app,
we're gonna hit Create
04:15 - I'm going to pop in, let's say, "Skyfall"
04:18 - We put in the URL of that image.
04:19 - Let's give it a rating of 8,
04:21 - and because we love Roger Deakins
04:24 - spelled his name correctly
04:25 - was the DP, and that's why
we like this movie so much.
04:29 - Let's hit Create New Movie,
and boom, look at that
04:34 - and now when I hover over it...
04:39 - How beautiful is that? Right?
04:41 - Something that was created here
04:43 - and now turn into a reality.
04:46 - This is what I love about coding.
04:48 - So this is one of my invoices
I sent out a few years ago,
04:51 - but essentially, and I'll
give you guys a tip too,
04:54 - for those of you guys who
want to become a Developer,
04:57 - or who already are a Developer
04:59 - so, when you are sending invoices
05:02 - try to make them English friendly
05:05 - so when the people are reading it,
05:06 - they actually know what you're doing.
05:09 - Don't just add stuff
that makes sense to you
05:11 - but doesn't make sense
to the other person.
05:13 - So, for example,
05:14 - I'll be like, "Spent the
entire day switching frameworks
05:18 - and this will save the
company hundreds of hours
05:20 - of development time."
05:21 - Okay, so they're like,
"Oh, this person moved
05:23 - from Flask to Django.
05:24 - What the hell does that mean?"
05:25 - Well, all you need to
know, if you're the CEO
05:28 - is that it saves you hundreds of hours.
05:30 - And, you know, this is
me sending invoices.
05:33 - Like, just putting in stuff,
05:35 - this was the front-end task we did
05:37 - We added gorgeous, clickable events
05:41 - Or I also break it down
into back-end stuff we did
05:44 - where we're adding
something to the database
05:46 - which is harder for your
client to understand,
05:50 - but please, put in the
effort to make it as easy
05:53 - as possible for them to
understand what you've done
05:56 - and what the result of
that thing is in English.
06:00 - And use your invoice as, like, that,
06:02 - and this is me just boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom,
06:05 - telling them everything that
took place for that week.
06:08 - So, this is some of what I do in my day.
06:13 - It's part of my day, is
also, sending invoices
06:16 - and writing down beautiful, descriptions.
06:21 - Once my work day is over,
06:22 - I like to take a little bit of a break.
06:25 - I'll look up at the sky,
chill, look at the pool,
06:28 - just relax.
06:29 - And then, I go meet a friend.
06:34 - Walking the streets of Hollywood
Boulevard, pretty cool.
06:37 - Once, it was a dream.
06:38 - Now, I get to live here.
06:40 - Really fascinating,
06:41 - and that's all thanks to being
able to become a freelancer.
06:44 - (smooth jazzy tempo)
06:59 - Hold on, Alexa, play "Bangerang"
07:02 - - [Alexa] "Bangerang" explicit by Skrillex
07:04 - - [Developer] You know
the song obviously, or no?
07:06 - - [Girlfriend] I don't
know this song at all.
07:09 - - Well, all you need to
know is there's a beat
07:11 - and then a drop.
07:12 - (edm beat)
07:35 - (chuckles quietly)
07:36 - - [Friend] Spicy?
07:37 - (coughs)
07:39 - - It went down the wrong pipe. Half-pipe.
07:44 - (laughs loudly)
07:48 - Dude, this is so good.
08:16 - I end my day by reading a book.
08:19 - I love going to the bed
with something in my brain.
08:22 - "Relentless", for example,
08:24 - is an incredible book by Tim Grover.
08:28 - So, I'll read something that
sets my mindset straight
08:31 - for the next day.
08:33 - Another important tip I
wanna share with you is
08:35 - put your phone in airplane mode,
08:37 - and leave it outside of your bedroom
08:40 - before going in.
08:41 - That's what I do, every night.
08:44 - (peaceful music)
08:50 - After a day of feeding my
brain with code and books,
08:55 - feeding my relationships
08:56 - with spending time with
my friend and girlfriend,
08:59 - feeding my body with the gym,
09:01 - I usually feel very satisfied,
09:03 - and I smile when I sleep apparently.
09:07 - All right, so in this video,
09:08 - you saw what a life of a
Developer can look like.
09:11 - Especially, if you wanna work remotely
09:13 - not live that nine to five,
09:15 - have your own clients,
09:17 - and what it looks like how
much money you can make,
09:21 - what birthing an idea on a whiteboard,
09:24 - to its final form can look and feel like.
09:28 - As well as, how I schedule my day
09:31 - and how I hang out with a friend,
09:34 - do all the fun stuff, and
still get the work done
09:37 - and remain extremely productive.
09:39 - Now, if this is something you enjoyed
09:42 - and you want your life to
essentially look like this,
09:46 - or you want to jump into this
09:48 - I have put together an
incredible mind-blowing,
09:52 - three-part master class
09:55 - that will show you step-by-step
09:57 - exactly what you need to do
09:59 - with the opportunity in your life
10:01 - as a Python Developer can look like.
10:04 - What your earning potential can look like.
10:06 - And what are the exact
steps you need to take
10:09 - to make this happen in your life.
10:11 - Please, keep in mind,
10:13 - this training I've put together for you
10:15 - is absolutely free of
charge, completely free
10:18 - all I'm going to need from you is,
10:21 - your name, and your email address,
10:23 - and once you pop that in
10:25 - I'm going to send this training
over to you right away.
10:28 - With that said, the link is
going to be in the video below
10:32 - in the description.
10:33 - So, go ahead and click that link.
10:35 - I'll also try to put it here
on the screen, in the video.
10:39 - Thank you so much for watching!
