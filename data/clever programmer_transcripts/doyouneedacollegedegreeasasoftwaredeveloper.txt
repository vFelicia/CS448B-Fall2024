00:00 - why I dropped out of college as a
00:03 - programmer if you are trying to become a
00:06 - doctor or a lawyer then you might need
00:09 - college and you might need the degree
00:10 - otherwise it's impossible but if you
00:12 - want to become a web developer a full
00:14 - stack developer front-end developer
00:15 - maybe it's not so necessary understand
00:18 - that you need to actually earn your way
00:20 - out of it so what do I mean by that if
00:22 - you're considering dropping out and
00:23 - you're like hey there are a lot more
00:25 - practical things I could do in the real
00:26 - world I can work on real world projects
00:29 - get real experience instead of just
00:30 - learning Fury well don't just pack up
00:33 - your shop and drop out the first thing
00:35 - you need to do is prove to yourself that
00:37 - you're capable of surviving on your own
00:39 - personally for me while I dropped out
00:41 - was because I started getting
00:43 - freelancing opportunities and I was
00:45 - already doing software development work
00:47 - outside of college what ended up
00:49 - happening was I was starting to earn
00:51 - over six figure income while I was going
00:54 - to college
