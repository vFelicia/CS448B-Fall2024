01:07 - point um
01:09 - and one of the main things i want to

01:12 - we have to be able to build our own
01:14 - brands as developers
01:15 - and this is something you guys are
01:17 - seeing you guys are seeing probably a
01:19 - lot of
01:19 - have you guys seen a lot of developers
01:21 - channels out there like popping up
01:24 - yeah a lot a lot of channels right
01:27 - they're like tons of channels that are
01:28 - popping up everywhere
01:30 - so what is going on there like even
01:33 - even if i go to youtube right now
01:36 - right you guys have seen traversing
01:38 - media who knows about this channel
01:40 - traversing media
01:42 - right amazing channel uh we have aaron
01:46 - jack i don't know if you guys know about
01:47 - this youtube channel yeah i love that
01:49 - dude
01:49 - right uh he's a good friend of mine we
01:52 - speak quite a bit on instagram we
01:54 - you have uh and then the list just keeps
01:56 - going on what are some of your guys's
01:58 - other
01:59 - youtube channels that you guys really
02:00 - enjoyed
02:02 - simple programmer simple programmer
02:05 - ed dev web dev site
02:10 - yes that's another great channel
02:15 - which one net ninja
02:18 - okay am i sharing the screen with you
02:20 - guys by the way or no not
02:22 - no no no oh i'm not my bad so i'll share
02:25 - the screen
02:26 - okay there we go so free code camp
02:30 - yep and what other ones can you guys
02:32 - think of that you guys enjoy
02:37 - [Music]
02:41 - okay so look at that right
02:44 - there are so many channels that are
02:46 - popping up
02:48 - everywhere um and
02:50 - these just keep popping up every single
02:53 - day
02:54 - and so this opportunity at some point
02:57 - felt like
02:57 - will only existed for a few people but
03:00 - this is the opportunity that like i
03:02 - saw when i was drawing clever programmer
03:04 - right i i saw it as
03:06 - oh my god this is something that not
03:08 - only can i
03:10 - learn coding using this because it gives
03:12 - me a platform
03:14 - but i can share my journey and actually
03:15 - grow an audience does that make sense
03:18 - yeah yeah and so you guys don't need to
03:21 - be anybody like crazy special
03:23 - in order to be able to do this like
03:26 - there's so many channels like if i even
03:28 - take you to
03:28 - clever channel right and we actually
03:31 - switch to
03:32 - um and i go right over here and we go to
03:35 - uh
03:36 - let me go to sort by oldest
03:40 - if i go to my oldest videos who has
03:43 - anybody seen here my oldest videos on
03:44 - this channel
03:46 - i have seen like really all of your
03:47 - videos
03:49 - it's wild the progress it's crazy
03:52 - so like take a look at this this video
03:54 - that has 50 000 views
03:56 - this video never got any views for
04:00 - the longest time like ever
04:03 - um this is an odd video how are you even
04:06 - expecting to get views
04:08 - yeah it's a r video and it's so specific
04:10 - week two assignment
04:11 - one right and this video was made for
04:14 - only one person
04:16 - i had a client at the time that i was
04:18 - helping and
04:20 - i made a video just to help him in the
04:22 - video i even say his name
04:24 - so this video was just put up on youtube
04:26 - so he could watch it it wasn't meant for
04:28 - anybody else and like i'll show you this
04:30 - video
04:33 - [Music]
04:41 - in r it's called a vector our variable
04:44 - would be for now
04:46 - we're in one on 300 retain the
04:48 - information for a long variable
04:50 - pollutant
04:52 - right so in this now now a lot of you
04:54 - guys might not know r
04:56 - but all that's happening here is i'm
04:57 - teaching something and here this is like
04:59 - a for loop that i wrote
05:01 - okay just like a for loop how many of
05:03 - you in here
05:04 - have heard about or can write a for loop
05:12 - right most of you have heard about it or
05:15 - hopefully have written
05:16 - one for loop or know the difference
05:18 - between while loop and for loop right
05:19 - this is something that
05:20 - you end up picking up really early when
05:23 - you start coding
05:24 - and this is something that i picked up
05:26 - in r but he had trouble with it so all i
05:29 - did is just
05:29 - helped and explain it to him right
05:32 - and what it did is it made him um it
05:36 - made this video
05:37 - apparently this video helped so many
05:39 - people i had no idea
05:41 - like people coming out and they're like
05:43 - this is so helpful
05:44 - i i wish him
05:48 - let me mute guys if everybody could do
05:51 - me a favor
05:52 - if you guys have some sound coming out
05:54 - just please mute yourself and then if
05:55 - you have to say something
05:56 - just jump on in and unmute yourself that
05:59 - would be awesome
06:00 - because you want me to co-host so i can
06:02 - mute people yes please how does that
06:04 - work oh make co-hosts okay that was easy
06:06 - thank you thanks thanks brother okay
06:08 - cool
06:09 - all right i appreciate it so
06:12 - if i just keep going right a lot of
06:14 - these people are they found
06:16 - this is what coursera is missing this is
06:18 - not our sunny this is another sunny that
06:20 - used to follow my content back in the
06:22 - day
06:23 - um now they're like boom phd student
06:27 - trying to get my head around r this is a
06:30 - great resource so apparently i was able
06:31 - to help some phd
06:33 - all i knew at that time was how
06:35 - to write a for loop in r
06:37 - and solve that one problem but
06:38 - apparently i was helping a phd along the
06:41 - way
06:42 - see what i'm saying so i put that up
06:46 - um who here has heard of recursion
06:51 - okay some people let me see i'm gonna go
06:55 - through
06:56 - pretty simple yep so for some people
06:59 - it's simple
06:59 - some people have heard about it some
07:01 - people have not when i heard about it
07:03 - four years ago
07:03 - all i decided to do was make a video on
07:05 - it right
07:07 - and then even if you look at my
07:08 - tutorials here that
07:10 - initially got me started they were on
07:13 - really simple stuff like teaching the
07:15 - basics of python
07:16 - but the thing is it may be just my way
07:20 - of teaching worked
07:21 - right whereas like you guys could teach
07:24 - the same thing and for people who
07:25 - connect with you it might work with them
07:27 - have any of you ever taught anything to
07:30 - anyone and they found it helpful raise
07:31 - your hands or just say
07:33 - out loud yep so kazzy i have been
07:36 - tutoring like uh
07:37 - i've been tutoring for in the past one
07:39 - to two months and i've got clients
07:41 - paying me around 100 to
07:43 - 120 wow and how old are you
07:47 - um 14. jeez
07:50 - so you are tutoring people right if what
07:53 - your tutoring is providing help
07:55 - here's the thing that's happening right
07:57 - now right you're tutoring them
07:58 - one-on-one
08:01 - right you're working with them
08:02 - one-on-one
08:04 - what happens is when you make uh
08:07 - when you have a platform and when you
08:08 - can make a video now you can teach
08:11 - a hundred people at a time
08:14 - or even more like you guys are already
08:16 - helping so many people
08:18 - by just making some videos about uh you
08:20 - guys coding up some applications
08:22 - so that actually inspires me a lot and
08:24 - that was one of the main reasons why i
08:25 - even started off with all this kind of
08:27 - stuff that's what i'm saying if i can
08:28 - help someone then that's
08:29 - i don't even care about money because as
08:31 - long as i'm helping someone that's even
08:33 - better right because i'm just making a
08:34 - video that gives me pleasure that
08:37 - gives me some learning and after
08:44 - oh happy birthday that is sick
08:48 - wow congratulations man that is amazing
08:51 - happy birthday everybody who's watching
08:53 - this on youtube please wish him
08:55 - everybody's on this call just unmute
08:56 - yourself and yell out happy birthday to
09:06 - him
09:08 - birthday bianchu that's amazing thank
09:11 - you all of you
09:13 - thank you guys so much that is awesome
09:16 - that makes me happy that makes me so
09:18 - happy so happy birthday
09:19 - that's awesome i'm happy you're getting
09:21 - clients
09:22 - but you see the power of being able to
09:25 - you know potentially
09:27 - teach in a way where you can be helping
09:29 - a lot more people at a time and like you
09:31 - said you're like i care
09:32 - i don't care that much about the money i
09:34 - actually care more about helping people
09:36 - so there's nothing wrong with charging
09:38 - people and working with them
09:40 - but i think you can also do this at the
09:42 - side is that possible
09:45 - yeah it is actually it is right so like
09:48 - the truth is you know we all feel like
09:51 - there's so much that you need when in
09:53 - reality it's actually like pretty simple
09:56 - the story behind this is let me show you
09:59 - something okay so i'm gonna take you
10:00 - guys behind the scenes
10:01 - have any guys have you guys ever been
10:03 - curious to go behind the youtubers like
10:05 - analytics and see what's going on
10:09 - a good youtuber's analytics yeah okay
10:12 - okay
10:13 - cool all right so let's go here so i'm
10:15 - probably an okay youtuber right eight
10:17 - hundred thirty five thousand subscribers
10:19 - uh we're we're on our way to hitman
10:21 - you're way better than average you know
10:23 - like i've seen so many tech channels who
10:25 - are still
10:25 - struggling around like 50k right i mean
10:28 - you're better than me so
10:29 - that's all i care about so let me show
10:32 - you guys something okay so i'm gonna go
10:33 - into analytics and
10:35 - here's what's going on man i just
10:37 - actually got a
10:38 - really great idea that i will
10:40 - share with you guys after this call but
10:42 - it's totally random you guys can see my
10:45 - screen right
10:47 - yep yes so now i want to show you
10:48 - something
10:51 - um these are the views that we're
10:52 - getting on a current
10:54 - like day-to-day basis okay so 57 000 67
10:57 - 000 57 000 and right now this month
11:00 - youtube just in ad revenue youtube has
11:02 - paid us four thousand seven hundred
11:04 - twenty one dollars
11:06 - okay that's sick that's huge
11:10 - right so it's like if you woke up one
11:12 - day and you just had two hundred ten
11:13 - dollars then you woke up the next day at
11:14 - 176 dollars then you woke up the next
11:16 - 172 dollars
11:17 - and every single day and this is outside
11:20 - of any other thing right this is outside
11:22 - of like you being able to
11:24 - help somebody with like selling a
11:26 - product or you
11:27 - coaching somebody this is just like
11:28 - youtube paying you
11:30 - because you're making content would you
11:32 - guys
11:33 - like would you like being paid just by
11:37 - youtube to share your knowledge
11:38 - do you would you guys like the idea of
11:40 - that yes or no yeah
11:42 - bro right now and that is like
11:45 - i have heard so many people always talk
11:46 - about you know earning a lot and it is
11:48 - i'm even seeing you right now and we all
11:50 - know that it is very possible it's very
11:52 - real
11:53 - yeah but what is a very common question
11:55 - among a lot of people is
11:57 - that um what does it cost them right
11:59 - many people don't even consider that and
12:00 - they just jump in
12:01 - and they think of it to be very simple
12:03 - to get along it i
12:04 - understand the price of it but many
12:06 - people don't so i would
12:08 - appreciate it if you could touch it so i
12:10 - like i like your
12:11 - i like the point that priyanshu brought
12:13 - up he's like people
12:15 - see this and they like it but they don't
12:17 - actually understand what it takes to be
12:19 - able to build this
12:20 - so now is it cool if i share with you
12:22 - guys what it actually takes to build
12:24 - this
12:25 - definitely exactly okay so let me go
12:29 - to lifetime okay and let me show you
12:33 - guys something
12:34 - really funny you guys see
12:38 - let me let me show you guys this okay so
12:40 - let's go to views
12:44 - do you guys see this period right over
12:45 - here yeah
12:48 - stagnant hold on let me know
12:51 - let me go yeah right there you guys see
12:52 - that invisible period right there
12:58 - that's 10 months of my life
13:00 - where i worked my
13:01 - face off
13:04 - with nothing in return
13:08 - like nothing nope like not even my mom
13:11 - would watch it
13:12 - i mean she kind of would actually but
13:16 - very much so that's a 10 month long
13:19 - period so if i actually zoom into that
13:21 - like everybody sees this right
13:23 - everybody's seeing this
13:24 - which is the highlight of everything
13:26 - that we've built and learned upon and
13:28 - momentum of all of the stuff that's
13:30 - happening from the past
13:31 - but this is actually really where it
13:33 - started so if i go custom and i go
13:36 - uh let's go 16 yeah
13:39 - so like the first kind of 10 months
13:43 - wait hold on what is this oh this is
13:45 - november 26
13:47 - okay one second let's go 16 right here
13:53 - so if you take a look at this 14 views 9
13:55 - views 41 views and i started in march of
13:58 - 2016
13:59 - so you can see going going nothing
14:01 - nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing
14:03 - may june july another month
14:08 - right all right just one more question
14:09 - over kazi how many videos did you
14:11 - produce in those 10 months
14:13 - so this is where i got like so this is
14:16 - where
14:17 - this comes in right this is important
14:19 - here i
14:20 - produced almost nothing
14:24 - very few videos i produce about three
14:26 - videos
14:27 - this is where i started to get my
14:29 - breakthrough
14:31 - and if you look over here seven videos
14:34 - in this week
14:35 - seven videos this week six videos this
14:37 - week
14:39 - and then and then like pretty quickly
14:42 - the breakthrough happened
14:48 - and uh right at this time i was actually
14:50 - working full time
14:53 - not when i say full time i was doing
14:56 - part-time jobs the equivalent
14:58 - of almost full-time work like that's how
15:00 - many jobs i would have back-to-back
15:02 - so i would go to college and then i
15:04 - would get out and i would go and teach
15:06 - people like whether i was coaching
15:07 - people in chess or whether i was
15:09 - coaching people
15:10 - in pro programming i would do that i
15:13 - would come home
15:14 - by 9 pm i had a window between 9 and 10
15:17 - pm because 10 pm i went to sleep
15:19 - so i built this entire channel
15:22 - in my window of 9 to 10 p.m
15:31 - when i would be in chemistry class and
15:33 - the reason i got like f's in my
15:34 - chemistry class was because i would sit
15:36 - in there plan out my youtube videos
15:39 - and then i would come home and at 9 00
15:40 - p.m like sharp i would start shooting
15:43 - and i would end my shoot around 9 40 p.m
15:46 - 9 50 p.m
15:47 - and then i would just like uh go
15:51 - so um and then i would like pretty much
15:54 - go to bed i would like
15:55 - hit upload on that video with no almost
15:57 - no editing and then i would just like go
15:59 - to sleep
16:00 - then i would wake up the next day go
16:01 - through the whole day do the same thing
16:03 - again
16:04 - rinse and repeat every day
16:07 - but i had a passion for it i was like
16:09 - excited about sharing something i knew
16:11 - and you can talk about coding but you
16:14 - don't have to talk about coding you can
16:16 - really talk about anything you're
16:17 - passionate about the craziest
16:19 - thing i talked with melissa about last
16:21 - time she was on our call
16:23 - is like she has a channel where she's
16:26 - like
16:26 - making content about sleeping
16:30 - where she has a lot of dreams and she
16:31 - remembers her dreams so she's taking
16:33 - what she remembers from her dreams
16:35 - gives it to her friend who has a really
16:37 - nice voice
16:38 - he records it and now it's like sleepy
16:40 - bedtime stories
16:42 - that you can listen to i told her put
16:43 - that on tick tock or youtube
16:45 - it will actually blow up on youtube
16:47 - because there's a lot of
16:49 - channels that have that are out there to
16:52 - just help you sleep
16:54 - channels where they just play rain
16:56 - sounds for like a 10 hour long video or
16:58 - they're just playing rain sounds
17:00 - you know i use those videos to go to
17:02 - sleep sometimes myself and so
17:05 - really it doesn't matter if it's like
17:07 - coding specific
17:08 - or if you're passionate about something
17:10 - else there's really nothing that's
17:11 - stopping you from
17:12 - being able to do that oh i've totally
17:15 - forgot that there's chat
17:20 - okay
17:21 - [Music]
17:25 - wait okay cool just muted that
17:29 - so if you look at it look in the first
17:32 - ten months i made nine dollars
17:34 - do you think my mom was like super proud
17:37 - at this time and was like yo
17:38 - like quit college quit everything
17:42 - no because that's all you see when
17:44 - you're here
17:45 - you don't see the lifetime chart of what
17:47 - happens four years from now all you see
17:49 - is this
17:51 - um if i go to one month later
17:55 - 12 30.
18:02 - what about this now this is getting
18:04 - spicier
18:06 - right this right here
18:11 - in december is where i started getting
18:12 - my breakthrough this
18:14 - is when i decided to quit college
18:22 - right there
18:25 - that's when i made the decision like
18:27 - mid-december
18:30 - because it was starting to break through
18:32 - whatever i was learning i was able to
18:34 - help people with
18:35 - and same thing like i was learning
18:37 - coding i was like getting better at
18:39 - coding in those days you guys
18:40 - so like everything i was learning i was
18:43 - trying to share it as fast as possible
18:46 - you know i wasn't much better than like
18:48 - even the people who are probably really
18:50 - beginner here
18:51 - on this call right now and you feel like
18:53 - you're like pretty beginner
18:54 - i was probably around that skill level
18:58 - and but everything i learned i just made
19:00 - it a mission to share
19:01 - right away if i learned it i just shared
19:04 - it was it good enough i don't know
19:07 - would it help this you know would it
19:09 - help like my motto was just one
19:12 - and this is something melissa was on
19:14 - that call too but like my motto became
19:16 - just one
19:17 - how many people does it need how many
19:20 - people need to view this video
19:22 - for us to be happy just one
19:27 - how many people to need to get the
19:28 - results from this
19:30 - for us to be happy just one how many
19:33 - people's
19:34 - lives need to change as a result of
19:35 - watching what you have
19:37 - what you've put up one just one
19:43 - and so that became the voice in my head
19:46 - just one
19:47 - i don't need these seven thousand people
19:49 - to get help if i can just help that one
19:51 - person
19:52 - that's what helped me through this
19:57 - but most people have the expectation of
19:59 - this
20:01 - so they're gonna quit right here
20:03 - everybody's gonna quit right here that's
20:04 - why it's so easy
20:08 - my expectations were i don't deserve
20:10 - anything i'm some random kid from
20:11 - pakistan
20:12 - i'm getting lucky every view is a
20:14 - blessing when the first day i got my two
20:16 - subscribers right around here i
20:18 - danced in my in i danced around my
20:20 - entire house in my underwear
20:25 - i swear to god i was like oh my god like
20:28 - jumping up and down my parents were just
20:30 - like laughing and like trying to chase
20:31 - me like what's happening like tell us
20:33 - i'm like i got two subscribers and they
20:36 - started jumping up and down
20:38 - it meant nothing i got paid nothing for
20:41 - it
20:42 - whereas i have had the same friends
20:44 - who've started to try to grow their own
20:46 - youtube channel they got 100 subscribers
20:48 - and they were sad what do you think
20:50 - happened long term
20:52 - they were sad because they didn't
20:54 - appreciate as many things they quit
20:56 - right so like
20:59 - they didn't continue whereas if i can
21:03 - feel like this is a win
21:04 - you better believe i'm gonna be
21:06 - celebrating the out of this
21:08 - every day is a lucky day oh my god like
21:12 - wow and so then then the results of this
21:15 - compound
21:16 - over time right so if i go back to
21:19 - 2016 but let's just say i extend this
21:21 - out to
21:23 - uh the next year so march 2016 i started
21:27 - but take a look at what was going on by
21:29 - 2017
21:34 - damn 108k plus subscribers that's huge
21:40 - 70 plus hours 100 000 subscribers
21:44 - you have three point nine million people
21:47 - yep it's insane
21:48 - it's kind of crazy right and this is how
21:51 - i actually calculated so i say
21:55 - how much did i help the world move
21:56 - forward okay
21:58 - so every minute every minute somebody
22:00 - watches something of mine i go
22:02 - that's i help the world move forward by
22:04 - two minutes okay
22:06 - so what's the math on 270 000 hours can
22:09 - somebody help me turn that into days so
22:11 - 270 000
22:13 - hours
22:19 - 12 days 11 days what did you say
22:23 - like around 11 days or 12 days
22:28 - i don't know about that oh wait never
22:30 - mind ignore me
22:31 - all good way more than that
22:35 - what should i what should i multiply
22:36 - this by what should i move
22:50 - now what i want to do is i want to
22:51 - divide it by years 365.
22:56 - so i helped the world in 2017
23:00 - i helped the world move forward by how
23:02 - much
23:03 - 30 years by 30 years
23:07 - one year of my life helps the world move
23:09 - forward by 30 years
23:13 - so when you think about now you feel
23:15 - like a civil servant
23:18 - yeah complex so it's like if you
23:22 - spend one year and you make an impact of
23:24 - 30 years would you feel fulfilled
23:26 - like internally yes
23:29 - yes i don't give a damn money anymore
23:31 - bro i'm i'm happy with my life
23:34 - right so this is this is the that was
23:37 - the whole point of it like
23:38 - i didn't need the 108 000 subscribers
23:41 - and what that gave it away is
23:42 - how like i was working within this time
23:44 - frame right i didn't need the money to
23:47 - do this
23:48 - that's why i was able to actually get
23:49 - through that really hard part
23:51 - everybody looks at this part then they
23:54 - set their expectations like right here
23:57 - so they're gonna fail you need to set
24:00 - your expectations like
24:01 - way over in like the garbage can but
24:04 - like enjoy the journey along the way
24:06 - and all you all you have to do in the
24:08 - process actually
24:10 - share what you're up to just one more
24:13 - thing
24:14 - so what happens is that say that you
24:18 - luckily i hope that this happens to
24:19 - everyone but say luckily you
24:21 - uh at the beginning of your youtube
24:22 - journey you start gaining like your tone
24:24 - followers and internal subscribers
24:25 - and you uh basically like you you use
24:29 - all those
24:29 - hashing hashing techniques and all that
24:31 - kind of stuff and you're an amazing
24:32 - marketer right so you know all about the
24:34 - youtube algorithm right and you succeed
24:36 - but after the point of time it's like
24:38 - it's almost inevitable that one of one
24:41 - or one time or another i'm pretty sure
24:42 - that even clever programmer must have
24:44 - been on the
24:45 - two dying right after growing uh very
24:47 - high
24:48 - it is quite possible that the entire
24:50 - business might die someday
24:51 - but what happens is that i'm pretty sure
24:53 - that clever programmer has already faced
24:55 - those kind of situations
24:56 - and even talked about it uh in one of
24:58 - the freelancing um
25:00 - calls with rachel i believe yeah and
25:03 - then you
25:03 - told them that okay we brought it out
25:05 - together right but what happens is that
25:07 - if you haven't been through that
25:08 - struggle
25:09 - if you haven't if you hadn't been
25:11 - through that struggle i'm pretty sure
25:12 - that you would have been so broke
25:14 - that you would have thought that oh my
25:15 - goodness what i'm going to do right now
25:16 - right
25:17 - but you you because you had seen those
25:20 - struggles and you have seen those
25:21 - reactions i'm pretty sure that
25:22 - that's the only reason why you succeeded
25:24 - yeah no those struggles are really
25:26 - really important
25:27 - because without those struggles like you
25:29 - cannot grow
25:30 - so it was actually super helpful for me
25:32 - to face them like i
25:34 - my biggest areas of growth happened when
25:36 - i was
25:37 - the saddest where i felt like everything
25:39 - that i had like built was gonna get
25:41 - destroyed
25:42 - but it's just like literally gonna face
25:44 - this everywhere like whether you have a
25:46 - job
25:47 - whether you go to school like you're
25:49 - gonna have that same feeling
25:50 - pretty much everywhere so it's a process
25:54 - but
25:54 - it's it helps you grow okay so it's it's
25:57 - just like part of the journey
25:59 - my message would be to anyone who is
26:01 - watching this entire youtube video would
26:02 - be
26:03 - to don't don't give up basically like
26:06 - this
26:06 - all that kind of is part of the process
26:08 - so right if you are failing then uh
26:10 - learn from it learn from your mistakes
26:12 - and uh remember this quote that uh
26:15 - if if nothing kills you then it only
26:17 - makes you stronger right yeah you
26:18 - remember that
26:19 - yeah 100 so really wise words so like
26:23 - yeah i mean
26:24 - don't quitting is if you
26:28 - the only reason you'll quit is if you do
26:30 - it in a way you don't enjoy it
26:31 - so what's really important is to make
26:34 - sure you're doing it in a way you enjoy
26:35 - it because you can't have the same
26:37 - expectations like
26:38 - everybody can play basketball but not
26:40 - everybody's going to be lebron james
26:43 - right just because you know how to shoot
26:46 - a basketball now you're going to win
26:47 - i love gary vee says that a lot just
26:50 - because you start a channel
26:52 - or you start something doesn't
26:54 - necessarily mean you're gonna have the
26:55 - same exact results
26:58 - but even if the results were different
27:00 - if you just get to
27:01 - share something you really enjoy and
27:03 - believe in and have like-minded people
27:05 - wouldn't that be exciting
27:10 - so that's really the part of the game
27:12 - like to do it in a way where
27:13 - it you find it exciting so um
27:17 - what i want to do is i want to open the
27:18 - floor up to some questions you guys have

28:24 - no one actually talks about how you can
28:26 - do it too right i'm not interested in
28:27 - what you did right i'm interested in how

29:57 - somebody um some other people also jump
29:59 - on and
30:00 - get a chance to speak as well hey
30:03 - can you drop the link on the on the zoom
30:05 - chat please okay
30:06 - sure i'll do that right now copy paste
30:08 - boom this is something like i haven't
30:11 - seen
30:11 - any youtuber talk like any of the
30:13 - developer youtubers talk about how you
30:15 - can actually grow your own developer
30:17 - youtube brand and there's just too many
30:20 - channels out there like tech lead
30:22 - jomatech you know and like every day
30:25 - you'll see a developer channel pop
30:27 - up so it's not something that's like
30:29 - very hard to do anymore a lot of people
30:31 - are figuring out that this is something
30:32 - very possible and a lot of them can do
30:34 - it
30:36 - okay one question that i have quasi is
30:38 - that um
30:39 - if there are so many tech channels
30:41 - already available over here
30:43 - but uh doesn't this reduce the
30:45 - opportunity that we have
30:48 - now
30:51 - yeah no because um so here's the thing
30:54 - so people often go people often go
30:58 - hey what is hold on what
31:01 - so people often ask this right they're
31:03 - like hey
31:05 - what happens when everybody starts
31:06 - jumping in this doesn't it reduce the
31:08 - opportunity
31:09 - and then there's other people who are
31:10 - like i want to be really unique and i
31:12 - want to jump into something that doesn't
31:13 - exist
31:15 - very rarely jump into something that
31:17 - doesn't exist unless you're
31:19 - like very gifted or you just kind of
31:22 - know it's gonna work
31:24 - you want to go to where things exist so
31:27 - let me ask you guys something right
31:29 - if you had a choice to open up a store
31:31 - would you open up the store
31:33 - in like an abandoned desert or would you
31:35 - open up a store
31:37 - in like a mall that's like super popping
31:40 - mall right
31:43 - definitely the mall so you would open
31:45 - the store in a mall
31:46 - why isn't now there are more competition
31:48 - why don't you open it in the
31:50 - desert like there's no competition
31:51 - nobody's there you're totally unique
31:54 - nobody's there to buy it nobody is there
31:56 - actually
31:57 - nobody's there so nobody's there that's
32:01 - the point that's the punch line
32:03 - so here the lesson is put results over
32:07 - your ego
32:09 - okay you like put results over
32:11 - uniqueness
32:12 - people often value uniqueness more than
32:14 - they value like actual results so
32:16 - put results on a pedestal because when
32:19 - you choose to do that you realize
32:21 - oh all those developers are just
32:23 - bringing more people into being
32:25 - developers
32:26 - like i'm not your competition i'm
32:28 - helping you
32:30 - if priyanshu creates a channel tomorrow
32:32 - i'm helping him by getting people
32:34 - interested in javascript and python
32:37 - then those people then go to priyansha's
32:39 - channel because it pops up in my
32:40 - recommended
32:43 - when people are watching clever
32:44 - programmer video and they're watching
32:46 - mine
32:46 - on the right hand side they will see
32:49 - sayuri's
32:50 - new video then they click it
32:54 - see what i'm saying so like everybody
32:57 - who's there
32:58 - is actually not your competition they're
32:59 - actually helping you
33:01 - by making that niche more popular
33:06 - damn never lived never before
33:10 - yeah so it's actually creating much
33:13 - bigger opportunity
33:14 - than like it's taking away so that's the
33:17 - really important thing to take care okay
33:18 - guys i'm gonna open up the floor for
33:19 - questions
33:20 - so let's go so hi kazee
33:24 - anand over here okay hold on give me one
33:26 - second i wanna
33:28 - look at where you are okay anand go for
33:30 - it yeah
33:31 - hi so uh my journey with uh clever
33:34 - programmer began
33:35 - in uh like last year october but uh
33:39 - i purchased uh profit uh profitable
33:42 - python back then it was known with a
33:44 - different name
33:44 - yeah so but i couldn't uh pay the whole
33:47 - amount so i had to
33:48 - back off after one month but i made up
33:51 - my mind like i will save a little
33:53 - little right and i eventually got into
33:55 - profit with javascript
33:57 - so after that it's had it has been
33:59 - booming
34:00 - in my career in my youtube it's not big
34:03 - but it is
34:04 - still something like 520 subscribers
34:06 - nice you have a youtube channel
34:09 - yep nice that's awesome
34:14 - drop down like crazy code like crazy got
34:17 - it okay
34:20 - yeah so uh my my question is like when
34:23 - you've made your transition from
34:25 - uh from the whole python uh mindset
34:28 - yeah and even from your channel
34:33 - i'm sorry somebody interrupted you just
34:36 - okay okay so say that say the question
34:37 - again so when i made the transition from
34:40 - python to javascript
34:43 - yeah and your channel it was totally
34:45 - focused on python and how to become a
34:47 - python freelancer
34:48 - and when you've made that change when
34:50 - you change the whole
34:51 - uh transition when you made the whole
34:53 - transition like right now your channel
34:55 - is focused on javascript it is still
34:58 - leveling up with python but now you're
34:59 - more concentrated on what's the trend
35:02 - right now so how do you make that
35:04 - transition while you're working as a
35:06 - youtuber
35:07 - because right now it's at that level
35:10 - that i am stuck because
35:12 - i created a full series for developing a
35:15 - portfolio
35:16 - with react on my channel and people
35:18 - actually liked it but right now
35:20 - i'm stuck how do i take i did it because
35:23 - people uh
35:24 - uh like my demo that i showed on youtube
35:28 - but
35:29 - after that like right now i want to help
35:31 - them to
35:32 - what areas i found that was that they
35:35 - were struggling in
35:36 - so but that is a totally different that
35:38 - is still react but it is a different
35:40 - domain it's not a
35:41 - portfolio thing it's a
35:46 - okay so you're trying to transition into
35:49 - what like you're transitioning from
35:51 - one particular from a project mindset
35:55 - uh to a coach mindset
35:58 - okay what's your goal are you trying to
36:00 - grow your channel
36:02 - uh that's my actually that's my
36:04 - secondary goal my primary goal is right
36:06 - now to help
36:07 - one person get a react developer job
36:10 - okay
36:10 - and what do you and what what do you
36:12 - mean like you're trying to coach them as
36:14 - in like they'll pay you and you work
36:15 - with them one-on-one
36:17 - uh no i i cannot give that much time to
36:20 - uh each individual so what i thought
36:23 - like i will do is
36:24 - group coaching not on group coaching it
36:28 - will be on youtube it will be a series
36:30 - of uh
36:31 - the latest skill because being in an iit
36:34 - industry
36:35 - so why don't you just why don't you just
36:36 - make that youtube content
36:39 - yeah that's exactly what i'm trying to
36:41 - do but
36:42 - i don't know how to uh switch the gears
36:45 - from uh from um project based to a
36:48 - coaching base
36:48 - you just do it that's a secret so i'll
36:51 - i'll share something with you
36:53 - can somebody help with
36:56 - this
37:00 - oh come on i'm on it all right all right
37:02 - cool
37:03 - um i'll yeah nice
37:06 - so here is the here's the trick to
37:08 - actually making this happen
37:10 - so he's asking like hey qazi how did you
37:12 - make the transition from
37:14 - like just pure you guys saw that
37:15 - transition happen on my channel are some
37:17 - of you guys
37:18 - aware of that transition happening it
37:20 - was all python and then it became like
37:21 - javascript
37:23 - it's very simple what happened was um
37:27 - to make your ideas a reality you have to
37:29 - live in like
37:30 - extreme practicality world you can't
37:33 - live in theory land that's how like
37:34 - ideas don't happen
37:36 - so one of the skills that is my gift and
37:38 - i'm extremely good at it is
37:40 - making things practical so when we put
37:43 - out javascript content we just decided
37:45 - to put it out
37:46 - and then it got so much traction and
37:48 - people loved it
37:50 - um then we were able to put an amazing
37:52 - team behind javascript so like we got
37:54 - nas behind javascript we had
37:56 - aaron we had me we had frank with the
37:58 - whole team get behind javascript and
38:01 - start like promoting it and then we had
38:03 - amazing reception from the people so
38:05 - tons of people joined the course
38:07 - and then even when we would drop the
38:08 - videos on youtube we just have tons of
38:09 - traction
38:11 - so now here's think of it from our
38:14 - perspective right
38:15 - i am not i don't care about any specific
38:18 - technology
38:19 - what i care about is people landing jobs
38:22 - does that make sense
38:24 - like i care about how i can bring the
38:26 - most amount of value to people
38:28 - so if python video does a hundred
38:30 - thousand views and if i drop a
38:31 - javascript video and it does 500
38:33 - 000 views the javascript video lands
38:35 - five people jobs
38:36 - and the python one lands one person a
38:38 - job
38:40 - which moral which one am i gonna go with
38:42 - more
38:44 - yeah you see what i'm saying so like
38:47 - moral compass is extremely easy
38:49 - where are people getting more value i
38:51 - don't give a about myself
38:52 - i don't care if my channel was branded
38:54 - in a certain way so i care about the
38:56 - people then secondary
38:58 - i am running a business i want to take
39:00 - care of my employees i want to make sure
39:02 - everybody gets paid
39:03 - so if more people are purchasing
39:05 - javascript products
39:06 - then i want to sell more javascript
39:08 - products a bit then we can actually then
39:09 - hire even more talent
39:11 - produce even more content and help even
39:13 - more people does that make sense
39:15 - yeah yes so when it came to making the
39:18 - content you
39:19 - just make it now there are tricks and
39:22 - tips that i can get into
39:23 - like how you make content that's just
39:25 - banger and like will work and do really
39:27 - well that took me
39:28 - so many years to like learn but
39:32 - the trick is you just make content and
39:34 - you can actually like here's another
39:35 - thing right in the pr
39:36 - right now i'm gonna hire a few python
39:38 - developers probably
39:39 - i'm like about to expand like crazy we
39:41 - just hired three new people last week
39:43 - i'm gonna hire a lot more people
39:45 - in the upcoming few weeks and then we
39:47 - might start creating content for python
39:49 - and javascript simultaneously
39:52 - and we might just grow both of those at
39:54 - the same time
39:56 - con here's the thing just make valuable
39:59 - content
40:00 - if you make valuable content on
40:01 - essentially any topic and you do a good
40:03 - job of
40:04 - making it and providing value people are
40:06 - going to start knowing you as that
40:11 - yep so just make the content and you'll
40:13 - be fine
40:15 - don't spend too much time thinking about
40:16 - how you're going to transition or
40:18 - whatever
40:18 - just actually just do it
40:22 - okay thanks you got it
40:26 - all right more questions guys i'd love
40:28 - to take one
40:30 - more question once i can pronounce you
40:32 - hold on hold on one second
40:33 - one second i love you just one second
40:35 - i'm gonna make sure other people get a
40:36 - chance
40:37 - and then we'll come back anybody has a
40:39 - question
40:41 - yeah okay hey okay go for it
40:46 - so i i actually dropped the question in
40:48 - the chat but i'm just gonna mention it
40:49 - now so i have a youtube channel which i
40:51 - started
40:52 - about a year ago i've been following you
40:53 - for quite some time so
40:55 - you really inspired me to to uh put the
40:57 - channel up
40:58 - so i i mainly did it because i want to i
41:01 - want to showcase what i do and i love
41:02 - what i do
41:04 - it's basically the artificial
41:05 - intelligence and business intelligence
41:07 - nice uh space so what i did was i
41:09 - started making videos
41:10 - um on youtube and then i started
41:12 - transitioning into my organization
41:14 - and they really loved it but like how do
41:17 - you deal with consistency in terms of
41:18 - constantly consistently making
41:21 - those videos and and and having the
41:23 - motivation to
41:24 - to to go forward with it how do you deal
41:26 - with that okay
41:28 - so i love that question and we'll get
41:30 - into it a little bit so this is your
41:31 - channel right
41:33 - yeah okay and these are all the videos
41:35 - on your channel
41:37 - okay cool started 11 months ago so you
41:40 - right now so i want to ask you a few
41:42 - questions and then we'll get into it
41:45 - so um do you enjoy making this content
41:49 - did you enjoy it
41:51 - i i do i do okay so what made you stop
41:54 - making it
41:56 - to be honest with you i'm not sure i
41:58 - think it's like my work commitments but
42:00 - i think that's a lame excuse um
42:03 - i i should have actually just continued
42:04 - but because i really enjoyed what i did
42:06 - i really enjoyed making those videos
42:08 - and i even purchased software to to make
42:10 - them animated etc so
42:12 - i'm not sure what has stopped uh but but
42:15 - yeah i do enjoy
42:16 - it okay so you enjoy the process of
42:18 - making it
42:19 - yeah um you are enjoying them but like
42:23 - for some random reason you've come to a
42:24 - stop
42:26 - yeah so it's just like halted like i do
42:28 - make some videos which i don't post on
42:30 - youtube because
42:31 - it's propriety proprietary to my
42:33 - organization so i i can't put on youtube
42:36 - uh but yeah i'm not consistent with the
42:38 - youtube channel i i sometimes make more
42:40 - videos with the organization than i do
42:42 - for the youtube
42:43 - got it so yeah okay so
42:46 - few different things are happening here
42:48 - so one
42:49 - you're um here's the thing right when
42:53 - in in areas where you start getting wins
42:55 - you start going towards those areas more
42:57 - just like naturally
42:59 - yeah if you start getting wins and like
43:00 - you start getting viewership
43:02 - you're gonna kind of naturally start
43:03 - going more in that direction that
43:05 - happens
43:06 - um few things that happened for me is
43:08 - the reason why i quit my
43:09 - school and every single client i dropped
43:11 - every single client too by the way
43:13 - the same time i quit college and i had i
43:16 - was making ten thousand dollars a month
43:17 - and i dropped it to zero dollars
43:19 - income and that put pressure on me to
43:23 - to like actually produce content so then
43:25 - i was excited to produce content and
43:27 - it was like if i don't actually do it i
43:29 - have to
43:30 - you know like i can't actually survive i
43:31 - have to go do something else
43:33 - yeah so um those things
43:36 - for me help now for you i know that if
43:39 - the practicality came into it that would
43:41 - be like one thing that would help you
43:42 - but that's kind of like
43:44 - not the right way to move forward
43:47 - one thing i would recommend for you is
43:49 - like i think you really just gotta like
43:52 - for you what i would do is i would just
43:54 - consume content around
43:56 - wanting to create content on youtube
43:58 - like literally like consume people's
44:00 - content we're talking about youtube
44:02 - so one of them would be me i actually
44:03 - just started um
44:06 - i don't know if you guys saw oh 848
44:10 - subscribers
44:11 - damn um i did not know we were at 848
44:14 - subscribers at all
44:16 - so that's awesome but i just started my
44:18 - completely new
44:20 - channel um
44:23 - this is something i've never felt before
44:26 - like ever in
44:27 - in some weird way like i just
44:30 - really truly enjoy making this content
44:33 - for no reason like literally for
44:37 - no like it's not attached to anything in
44:39 - any way like
44:40 - i just enjoy telling these stories that
44:43 - i'm i'm sharing here in these videos
44:45 - and like i'm not interested in like i
44:48 - have no purpose in mind to make money
44:50 - from them whatever i just like enjoy
44:52 - sharing this content
44:56 - for you i would just say like i think
44:58 - you should consume more things that make
44:59 - you want to do it you should probably
45:02 - try to be around people who are doing it
45:04 - because
45:05 - it seems like you are enjoying it too
45:09 - you know so like definitely i i love i
45:12 - love the industry i'm in so
45:13 - i definitely enjoy it um so yeah i just
45:17 - want like in terms of consistent my my
45:18 - consistency is not the greatest though
45:20 - and i really want to
45:21 - it's it's not even it's not even
45:23 - consistency it's just like
45:25 - you're just not doing it so there's
45:26 - something deeper that like you have to
45:29 - dig deep in like
45:30 - like for me i don't it doesn't make
45:33 - sense to me what you're saying because
45:35 - it seems to me you enjoy it
45:37 - you like making this content so what is
45:40 - it that's
45:41 - stopping you from putting it on youtube
45:43 - let's talk about that
45:52 - hello i think you pros
45:56 - live stream stream
45:59 - wait what froze no no i mean he
46:02 - historically oh okay okay you scared me
46:04 - all right yeah i think he i think his
46:05 - connection oh my god my live
46:07 - my youtube live froze your live is still
46:09 - going fine i'm watching it yeah yeah
46:11 - it's going okay so what i will say
46:15 - is oh velosh on your back
46:18 - yeah i'm back okay so did you hear my
46:20 - question or should i repeat it again
46:22 - uh can you please repeat it okay so
46:24 - there's something happening here
46:25 - that you aren't telling yourself and in
46:28 - a way you're not telling us
46:30 - if you are enjoying it and you enjoy
46:32 - making content for it
46:34 - what is stopping you from actually
46:36 - putting it out on youtube there's
46:37 - something that's happening there
46:41 - if if i'm if i'm honest with myself
46:43 - perhaps
46:44 - i'm probably thinking about maybe the
46:46 - criticism that i that i may receive
46:48 - because like
46:49 - there's so many like awesome people
46:51 - posting content about ai
46:54 - um in my industry so probably in the
46:56 - back my mind i'm probably thinking like
46:58 - maybe my content is not as it's good
46:59 - enough as this so
47:01 - so perhaps that's one of the reasons
47:03 - that is the main reason
47:04 - now you have hit the nail on the head
47:06 - and you guys feel that that sounds like
47:08 - the actual truth
47:11 - right yeah for sure so
47:15 - that's that's really what it is brother
47:17 - like that's what it is velocion
47:18 - it's those voices that you up those
47:21 - voices have stopped me for so long um
47:24 - if you actually watch this like a lot of
47:27 - people are like quasi i
47:28 - i should somebody watch this recently
47:31 - they're like i didn't know you had those
47:32 - voices in your head i'm like
47:33 - what the hell i'm like i'm just i'm
47:35 - human like i'm human too
47:38 - uh i think you should actually watch
47:41 - this at some point in the lotion
47:43 - um this is it was like
47:46 - i talked about it in this vlog that i
47:48 - recently made and i talk about the
47:50 - voices in your head actually stomping
47:51 - you and there were voices in my head
47:53 - that stopped me
47:54 - from even starting this brand even
47:56 - having 800 000 youtube subscribers and
47:58 - all of that and i wasn't posting
48:00 - i was like the video is not going to be
48:01 - like good enough i need more time
48:04 - um i can't post it because some people
48:07 - are gonna think of things
48:08 - and i just like never would keep posting
48:10 - it oh i need to have more results like
48:12 - if i talk about it
48:13 - like people are gonna be like what you
48:15 - only have 500 000 subscribers on youtube
48:16 - you
48:17 - suck like so i can't talk about how to
48:20 - grow your own youtube
48:22 - so those voices are the worst
48:26 - but the conversation that i had with my
48:27 - girlfriend and i talk about that in that
48:29 - video is
48:31 - there's something beautiful that happens
48:33 - when you just truly stop listening
48:35 - to other voices and just only listen to
48:38 - the voice that's in your head
48:39 - and let go of the other voices
48:43 - i have never in my life moved faster
48:46 - than i have had in the last
48:48 - few weeks because i'm just like
48:51 - i'm trusting my gut if i feel it in my
48:53 - gut in my instincts i just move on it
48:55 - and i'm
48:56 - trying to shut off all voices like
48:59 - people questioning me feeling the need
49:02 - to get
49:02 - everybody on board convince everybody
49:04 - that it's a good thing almost
49:06 - seek permission from people but like if
49:08 - you're making content like i'm looking
49:10 - at your content
49:12 - and let's actually look at uh which
49:14 - video are you the most proud
49:16 - of uh
49:19 - i think the other first one perhaps
49:23 - this one right here yeah
49:27 - okay i
49:39 - you need a phd or you need to be a math
49:42 - goal to see if
49:43 - the low to look at the columns
49:47 - we're gonna read right columns when
49:50 - who was trying dude this is
49:53 - awesome
49:57 - like this video is awesome how i know
50:00 - that is because i've seen
50:01 - thousands of youtube channels that are
50:04 - like posting
50:05 - content similar to this and blowing the
50:07 -  up
50:08 - like literally i've seen similar
50:10 - channels that have like 800 000
50:12 - subscribers million subscribers that are
50:13 - posting content like this
50:16 - um it's funny because it's the curse of
50:20 - the community that you are in
50:22 - um this happened to my brother who never
50:24 - posted content on
50:26 - color grading because he's like man i'm
50:28 - in this industry and everybody knows how
50:30 - to color grade
50:31 - there's a science to it they all look at
50:34 - like look down
50:35 - on me if i try to talk about it so he
50:37 - never shared anything about it
50:39 - same thing happened to my girlfriend she
50:41 - would never share anything about she's a
50:42 - professional boxer
50:44 - but she would never share anything about
50:46 - it because everybody in her community
50:47 - she
50:47 - knew would like make fun of her or find
50:50 - some kind of weakness and talk about it
50:52 - and share it
50:52 - because a tightly knit community so
50:55 - people are gonna make fun
50:56 - uh let me show you what is happening
50:58 - with my brother right now okay he
51:00 - also like one more thing is that you
51:02 - know i can actually give my own example
51:04 - over here because
51:05 - if but once you're like in india and if
51:08 - you're 13 years old and if you're trying
51:09 - to you know
51:10 - if you're telling your parents that okay
51:13 - uh dad i'm gonna do it i'm mom i'm gonna
51:15 - do it
51:16 - you know they literally laugh at you
51:17 - like like anything okay they just laugh
51:20 - at you and
51:20 - i was nearly in my tears back then and i
51:23 - said
51:25 - leave them okay i'm gonna show them my
51:27 - results and then they're gonna be proud
51:28 - and today they tell me that yes son you
51:30 - did something
51:31 - right so it's all about you know just
51:33 - getting over that feeling because
51:35 - i myself i faced that so many times in
51:37 - my school in my um
51:39 - like teachers always telling me and
51:41 - friends always telling me that you won't
51:42 - be able to do it do i even pursue why i
51:44 - even take the risk
51:45 - yeah all right let me show you something
51:47 - okay so let me show you something here
51:48 - below veloshan so check this
51:50 - out right this is my brother and he
51:53 - started his youtube channel
51:55 - uh and he only talks about color grading
51:58 - okay that he was like so scared to
52:00 - talk about he never wanted to like
52:01 - talk about this and this is when
52:05 - right around here was when i was pushing
52:07 - him to start it
52:08 - and this first these first two videos
52:11 - are a result of me just like
52:12 - pushing him so much for so long
52:16 - and then he finally just decided to
52:18 - start talking about it
52:20 - and now uh one year later i mean now
52:23 - he's like
52:24 - just flying right one year later he has
52:26 - whatever videos uploaded
52:28 - and 132 000 subscribers but he also let
52:32 - go of the job that he was uh i mean for
52:34 - him he got lucky like the day he called
52:36 - me
52:37 - he was like on the verge of tears and
52:38 - about to cry he's like i just got fired
52:40 - from my job
52:41 - and those clients were paying him almost
52:43 - like close to 20 000
52:44 - a month but like as soon as you told me
52:46 - that i put him on mute and i was like
52:48 -  yes whoa like i was the happiest
52:52 - that day that i've ever
52:53 - been and i was so happy last
52:56 - year
52:57 - in the summer and then i got back on the
52:59 - call and i'm like dude i'm so sorry that
53:01 - that happened to you
53:02 - because i knew that that's the day
53:04 - that's what he needed to actually start
53:06 - going in on what he truly enjoys and
53:08 - believes in
53:09 - and he did because he had no other
53:11 - choice and all
53:13 - the voice of all the other critics went
53:14 - away and then he started posting
53:16 - okay uh my other brother
53:20 - just recently started and he had the
53:22 - same voices and he didn't want to post
53:24 - because he's like oh they're actually
53:25 - gonna like probably
53:27 - uh take me out of the company
53:30 - and he just started posting and this is
53:32 - super recent so he just started i'll
53:34 - show you
53:34 - if i go to oldest two months ago right
53:38 - two months ago two months of
53:41 - posting what one two three four
53:43 - five ten videos that's not a lot of
53:45 - videos
53:46 - right ten videos and he's at thirteen
53:48 - hundred subscribers
53:51 - whoa now he's gone now he's gone he is
53:54 -  a fly like he's hit his
53:56 - like now he's just gonna be
53:57 - flying so
54:01 - it's really doable
54:04 - but like the biggest most awful thing is
54:08 - those voices
54:09 - that come into your head veloshan that's
54:11 - that's the main
54:12 - thing that's your achilles heel right
54:15 - now
54:19 - so talk to me with lotion like
54:22 - we're having this conversation what are
54:24 - you feeling right now what are the
54:25 - thoughts running through your head right
54:26 - now
54:27 - so based on what you just mentioned to
54:30 - me like
54:31 - i'm just gonna go for it like i do enjoy
54:34 - it
54:34 - and i'm not gonna really listen to like
54:37 - people around me just saying whatever
54:38 - they're gonna say about it even if
54:40 - there's hundreds of thousands of videos
54:41 - on youtube i'm just gonna go for it and
54:43 - i'm gonna do it
54:44 - i'm gonna see where it takes me to be
54:45 - honest with you because i'm not really
54:47 - doing it for
54:48 - um for the money um i really enjoy
54:52 - teaching i that that's why i enjoy
54:54 - sharing my knowledge with people like
54:56 - even
54:56 - even in my organization even though i i
54:59 - have a specific job role
55:00 - um i just love like helping people so
55:04 - that's why i want to do it and i'm just
55:06 - going to go ahead and go for it and see
55:08 - where it takes me so so yeah
55:09 - i think it's genuinely one of the most
55:12 - valuable things
55:12 - any one of us can do in our lives to be
55:15 - able to help people
55:17 - and if we have a platform or knowledge
55:19 - that we can share
55:21 - dude it's it's everything
55:24 - those comments are what keep me going
55:25 - when people are like yo like this video
55:27 - helped me with this thing
55:29 - or this video helped me land a job those
55:31 - that's everything people being able to
55:32 - pick up the things that were hard for
55:34 - you
55:35 - but you maybe explained it in a fun way
55:38 - so
55:38 - yeah and if you enjoy it dude that's
55:40 - your calling
55:41 - like you're so lucky to have found your
55:44 - calling and what you
55:45 - truly really enjoy so like
55:48 - now's not the time for other voices and
55:50 - it's only the voices of people who
55:52 - haven't done themselves
55:55 - yeah no official 100 100 i totally agree
55:58 - so what are you gonna do as a result of
56:00 - this conversation valencia
56:03 - so i'm gonna make my my next video over
56:06 - the weekend actually i actually have
56:08 - content
56:09 - which is just i just been playing around
56:11 - in my mind do i do it
56:13 - should i not do it but hold on hold on
56:14 - one second one second i'm gonna go for
56:16 - it

56:40 - on on his channel
56:41 - how would that make us feel
56:45 - amazing
56:47 - [Music]
56:49 - these are the voices i want you to have
56:51 - in your head
56:53 - cool awesome i'm going to make it this
56:54 - weekend 100 okay
56:56 - good good and share it with us okay drop
56:59 - it in the pwg channel
57:02 - uh there's a quote from steve jobs
57:05 - actually which says that
57:07 - don't let the noises of others opinion
57:10 - drown down your inner voices
57:13 - it's hard like it's the most
57:16 - beautiful thing and we've all heard it
57:18 - i'm sure it's the most cliche thing on
57:19 - the planet
57:20 - but like oh my god is it hard to do like
57:24 - to this day i struggle with it and like
57:27 - people struggle with it and i it's so
57:30 - hard
57:31 - but i'm learning i'm learning and i feel
57:33 - like i'm now have a better understanding
57:35 - of it than i did before but i feel like
57:37 - i'll still
57:38 - like i'll hear 15 years from now and i'm
57:39 - like oh my god
57:41 - it's brilliant it's even more brilliant
57:42 - now so
57:44 - it's truly a really hard thing to do
57:46 - it's not a easy thing to do so i'm very
57:48 - empathetic of that
57:49 - especially for an environment that like
57:52 - doesn't foster that if you're
57:54 - around people that don't like foster
57:56 - that then that's hard
57:58 - it's really hard so i can empathize with
58:00 - where you're at the lotion but like
58:02 - i want us to be the voices that fill
58:05 - your head now
58:07 - yeah you've got your back our back yeah
58:10 - thanks guys so just go man share your
58:12 - knowledge and just have fun enjoy it
58:14 - put it out there like if it's your
58:16 - calling and you enjoy it then that's
58:17 - what you enjoy like if you enjoy sharing
58:19 - stuff then you got to do it then that's
58:21 - your like obligation to do that you know
58:25 - okay by next week i wanna see how many
58:28 - videos are you gonna have on your
58:29 - channel by next tuesday
58:33 - so this weekend i'll make two videos at
58:35 - minimum
58:36 - beautiful two videos beautiful
58:40 - okay so by next tuesday we have two
58:42 - videos on your channel
58:45 - okay i commit to that amazing
58:48 - beautiful i love it i love it and that's
58:51 - all you got to do
58:52 - it's all you got to commit to it doesn't
58:54 - require you to do some crazy stuff
58:56 - but it just like when you're excited and
58:59 - motivated and you feel the shift
59:01 - happening
59:02 - those are when you got to make a
59:03 - commitment and lock it in lock it in
59:05 - with the date and the time
59:06 - after this call what i highly recommend
59:09 - maybe even right now veloshan
59:11 - is like what times you're going to do it
59:14 - um what time you want to shoot it or
59:17 - what day you want to shoot it if you can
59:18 - do that
59:19 - just by doing this called implementation
59:21 - intention you guys
59:22 - if you are motivated to do something
59:25 - they have found that
59:26 - motivation will get you 30 of the way
59:28 - there but by setting an implementation
59:30 - intention meaning
59:32 - setting a date time in place
59:35 - you're likely ninety percent likely to
59:37 - now do the thing that you want to do
59:39 - so let's have one more question in terms
59:43 - of
59:43 - in terms of your videos that you used to
59:45 - make when you started off
59:46 - did you like do like some sort of a
59:48 - script or do you just go ahead and just
59:50 - freestyle everything
59:51 - okay so um let's just go to the
59:55 - the source of the truth
59:59 - because that's just facts right if we
60:02 - actually go to my channel and i go
60:04 - to our uh and i sort it by
60:08 - let's go oldest so i'll tell you this
60:16 - these videos none of them are scripted
60:18 - like none of them
60:21 - all of them are one take uh this is when
60:24 - i developed my methodology called
60:26 - when i became what i now coined as the
60:28 - one take wonder
60:31 - um and it was all about like
60:35 - my channel was always about like not
60:38 - only providing value but improving my
60:40 - public speaking skills
60:42 - and i realized how many times am i
60:45 - speaking
60:45 - how many times when you and i were
60:47 - speaking velocia and you were like uh
60:48 - let me actually
60:49 - you're like cut let me say that again
60:53 -  i didn't say it right let me say it
60:55 - again no you and i just have a normal
60:57 - conversation right
60:58 - yeah and you do it in one take
61:01 - yeah we all have a conversation we're
61:03 - all one takers
61:04 - but then for some reason when it's time
61:06 - for video now we get so self-conscious
61:09 - that like we have to do 300 takes and so
61:12 - now that video takes 300
61:14 - times the amount of time that it should
61:16 - have taken it should have just taken
61:17 - that one time you explained the idea
61:19 - just like if you brought a friend and
61:20 - you explained that idea one time and
61:22 - it's done
61:24 - so i was a big believer in never
61:27 - removing anything and never redoing
61:28 - anything
61:29 - so like if this video says 39 minutes
61:32 - and 41 seconds
61:33 - it took exactly 39 minutes and
61:36 - 41 seconds to make
61:38 - the only thing i thought about ahead of
61:40 - time is okay i'm gonna talk about
61:43 - uh whatever like i was just walking
61:45 - through code academy tutorial so however
61:47 - far i get in those 39 minutes i get that
61:49 - far
61:50 - and then i just like do it and explain
61:52 - it as i go like i would
61:53 - to a friend so then
61:57 - the job of making content is like
62:00 - today at 9 00 p.m i started i finished
62:02 - at 9 39 p.m and then
62:04 - i prepared for bed and went to sleep
62:06 - this day i started at 9 00 pm at night
62:08 - i finished at 9 52 and then i went to
62:11 - sleep right
62:12 - and then i just kept repeating this
62:13 - process
62:16 - and the topics that you had did you did
62:18 - you plan them out like
62:19 - this is where so yeah this is where i
62:21 - was like a little bit strategic i found
62:22 - that code
62:23 - if you cover big websites and their
62:26 - walkthroughs
62:28 - um and i could just help you guide
62:29 - because i didn't see a lot of help on
62:31 - there and i saw a few people and i'm
62:33 - like this suck i could do it so much
62:34 - better
62:35 - and so i just made it on that so
62:38 - it's easy as because codecademy is
62:41 - providing all the material all i'm doing
62:43 - is just
62:43 - doing a walkthrough of it
62:48 - i just sit there and i'm like all right
62:49 - guys let's see what we're going to cover
62:50 - today
62:51 - and i was actually sick in this video
62:53 - too but i
62:54 - i just went ahead and made it anyway so
62:56 - here it is hey guys how are you doing
62:58 - so today i'm going to take on a very
62:59 - interesting challenge which is going to
63:02 - be
63:02 - i'm going to go through the entire code
63:04 - category and try to finish it as fast as
63:06 - i can
63:07 - and along the way my goal is to be able
63:09 - to help you guys
63:12 - i don't know what happened so
63:16 - my beard came along so like look at the
63:17 - comments right the amount of times he
63:19 - gulped he must be really thirsty
63:22 - right so like and then here don't ever
63:24 - stop uploading
63:26 - things so like you're you're gonna have
63:28 - people who are going to say
63:30 - yeah who thought the shy kid would be a
63:32 - loud millionaire
63:35 - four months ago yeah so
63:39 - you're gonna have people saying all
63:40 - kinds of but like i know the truth
63:42 - i know
63:43 - none of these i know none of the people
63:45 - would be here
63:46 - if i didn't listen to myself and make
63:47 - the content
63:49 - whether they're saying good like
63:52 - here's the real secret i don't even take
63:54 - the compliments to heart
63:58 - that's the real secret i'm not dependent
64:00 - on anything or anybody i don't even
64:02 - the compliments aren't even what drive
64:04 - me to do what i do
64:06 - so i'm like i have no vulnerability in
64:08 - that sense
64:09 - because if the i allow the compliments
64:11 - too much to give me validation
64:13 - then the negative comments are going to
64:15 - crush me
64:16 - now this is a little bit garyvee yes
64:19 - it's a little scary it's it's like
64:22 - really like gary vee and that's why like
64:23 - i resonate with him really hard but like
64:26 - i went to a school where i
64:30 - was like from 9 to 12 or 9 to 13
64:33 - i was physically beaten every
64:35 - day
64:37 - and the school imagine you're a
64:39 - nine-year-old kid
64:40 - and you have to be at the school you
64:42 - have to show up at 8 a.m and you have to
64:44 - leave at 10
64:44 - p.m there's no worldly knowledge there's
64:49 - nothing i'm learning about the world i
64:50 - had no math
64:51 - no science no computer programming
64:54 - nothing all i had to do was memorize
64:58 - a book in a language i actually don't
65:00 - understand
65:01 - in arabic i had to memorize a book
65:04 - okay i had to memorize the quran with
65:06 - not understanding a single letter of it
65:09 - so rote memorization so imagine learning
65:12 - a language that you have you don't
65:14 - understand
65:14 - learning how to read it and recite it
65:16 - and memorize it doing that for four
65:18 - years
65:19 - for 12 to 15 hours a day and every day
65:22 - you get
65:22 - beat the out of it was just because
65:24 - i was in a bad school
65:26 - there were plenty of schools that taught
65:27 - in a very humane way kind way loving way
65:30 - and like
65:31 - they're amazing i just happened to be in
65:32 - like a not a very good one
65:35 - and so you know as a little kid that's
65:39 - really really hard so it's really really
65:41 - sucked and bunch of the people that were
65:42 - at that school it mentally them
65:44 - up kind of forever
65:45 - for me what it did is so here's what
65:48 - sucked right i went straight from second
65:50 - grade in pakistan
65:52 - to seventh grade in united states
65:56 - so like when they told me hey turn in an
65:58 - essay
65:59 - uh i remember i was in seventh grade and
66:01 - the teacher and i just came out of this
66:02 - religious school i had no
66:04 - idea about how the world works this
66:06 - teacher goes hey i want you guys to turn
66:08 - in an essay and i asked him
66:09 - what does that mean and he's like make
66:11 - sure it's written clearly
66:13 - and i can understand and uh yeah so guys
66:16 - go ahead and do this and this
66:18 - uh needs to be two pages long so i said
66:20 - okay so i came back the next day i
66:22 - turned my essay in
66:23 - the whole class kind of started like
66:25 - snickering and like laughing
66:27 - the teacher like smiles a little bit and
66:28 - i'm like damn like i must have written a
66:30 - really good essay
66:32 - and i sat down and my friends are like
66:35 - how many pages did you write i'm like
66:36 - two
66:37 - and i'm like yeah i don't know why
66:39 - everybody was complaining like it was so
66:41 - easy to write these two pages come to
66:44 - find out
66:47 - i had written the essay in uh sci
66:50 - fo font size 72 uh
66:53 - and i was using green color font and i
66:55 - was using comic sans
66:58 - that's how i wrote the essay because i
67:00 - thought i needed to write it
67:02 - clearly that's what i what i thought
67:04 - that meant
67:05 - so when i had that happen and the whole
67:08 - class is laughing i like learned okay
67:09 - that's not how you do it this is not how
67:11 - it works okay cool
67:12 - so there are a lot of like weird things
67:15 - you know that happened to me
67:16 - and so they made it so where every day i
67:19 - would just wake up
67:20 - and not get beat up the next day i was
67:22 - just happy i was like oh my god
67:25 - i won today it's a 10 out of 10
67:27 - i didn't get beat up
67:28 - i don't have to be somewhere i hate for
67:30 - 15 hours a day like oh my god
67:32 - so to me in a really weird way it has
67:36 - made me the happiest i've ever been in
67:37 - my entire life
67:38 - i always have that like one point of
67:41 - reference
67:42 - like i know that it can get so bad
67:45 - physical and psychological abuse
67:47 - for 15 hours a day doing the thing that
67:49 - makes you the unhappiest
67:51 - force doing like it it
67:54 - it's hard for it to get worse and so it
67:57 - gave me a point of reference so that's
67:59 - why when i got that one subscriber i'm
68:00 - like oh my god i'm supposed to get beat
68:02 - up on sunday and instead i got one
68:03 -  subscriber
68:04 - let's go like it just made me the
68:06 - happiest person on the planet
68:08 - so those voices in a really weird way
68:11 - help me
68:12 - where like when i drop my tutorials i
68:15 - expect everyone to say bad stuff so when
68:18 - i see all the bad stuff i'm like yeah
68:20 - that's what i expect that's like normal
68:21 - just
68:22 - i expect everybody to say that but
68:24 - then like when i see the one great
68:26 - comment i'm like
68:26 - yo that's cool i'm like all right let's
68:30 - just keep going
68:31 - so you know it's it's a
68:34 - really really weird thing and when gary
68:37 - vee talks about it like it's a really
68:38 - weird game of self-awareness like
68:40 - really it hits me like i i feel that
68:43 - so that's all this was it was a python
68:46 - tutorial series
68:47 - veloshan and none of these are scripted
68:50 - none of these are scripted i'll show you
68:52 - like this is a little bit more scripted
68:54 - this video right here that got 477 000
68:57 - views
68:58 - but like you know but then it also got a
69:00 - lot of views
69:01 - uh this video was not scripted i just
69:04 - had maybe some key
69:06 - points like some bullet points none of
69:08 - these are scripted
69:10 - all of these tutorial ones where i just
69:11 - decided to launch a course
69:13 - as a developer guys like if you want to
69:16 - blow up your channel the biggest hack is
69:18 - just drop a free course on anything like
69:21 - literally if
69:22 - the lotion drops a free course on
69:24 - whatever thing he's doing
69:25 - and he makes like 14 videos on them he
69:28 - already knows it so it's not going to
69:30 - take him too long to make each of the
69:32 - videos
69:33 - and those can actually help you you know
69:35 - be put on the map
69:42 - all right layla
69:45 - i know that layla had raised her hand a
69:47 - while ago and gianna if you want to ask
69:49 - something
69:50 - no no no okay cool got it
69:53 - uh leila's still here no
69:56 - okay guys i'll take next question
69:58 - whoever wants to go
70:00 - george nice hat i love it i actually
70:04 - dropped a couple questions from the
70:05 - youtube
70:06 - it's they're posting so fast but i
70:08 - dropped a couple questions in the chat
70:10 - on here if you want to do those okay
70:12 - cool
70:13 - um also i want to know who else wants to
70:16 - go just so i have
70:17 - like a lineup of people and then we can
70:19 - go
70:22 - guys yeah i just have a couple of
70:24 - questions okay got it
70:26 - all right give me one second so we'll
70:28 - get to i'll go to
70:30 - you pre-ancient next because i didn't
70:32 - really see anybody else unless
70:33 - i'm in a view mode that i couldn't see
70:36 - um so
70:37 - melissa go for it
70:41 - hey i was just pulling questions off the
70:43 - youtube one guy said can you tell me
70:45 - which app i can use for
70:47 - video editing for the videos for youtube
70:50 - um so here's the craziest hack
70:54 - you guys can use um you can get really
70:57 - fancy and use final cut pro
70:59 - that's a lot of what i use to edit my
71:01 - content
71:02 - but guys i swear to god this can even
71:05 - kick
71:05 - final cut pro's ass and this is how i've
71:08 - been
71:08 - editing a bunch of my content lately and
71:11 - it's like
71:12 - just really really powerful it's called
71:15 - video leap
71:16 - and like i'm actually literally editing
71:18 - full on videos on this and this gives
71:20 - you really no excuse to make great
71:22 - content you can edit right on your phone
71:24 - it'll kick your final cut pro's ass
71:27 - because it'll load so fast on your
71:28 - computer
71:29 - you won't need to like do anything the
71:31 - app is called video
71:32 - leap somebody can drop the name and uh
71:36 - um i'll i'll just drop the name so video
71:39 - jesus
71:40 - oh thank you brian thank you
71:44 - yeah and brian needs to be on tick tock
71:48 - doing videos where he provides value and
71:50 - breakdances at the same time and i'm
71:52 - actually dead serious that's i'm not
71:54 - kidding
71:54 - actually i actually had an idea about
71:58 - um keeping the health
72:01 - actually like you know how to keep your
72:03 - physical health
72:05 - stable because a lot a lot of developers
72:07 - we sit in front of a computer the whole
72:08 - time but then we don't
72:10 - actually take our time to really like
72:12 - keep up postures and everything you know
72:13 - yes which i think i think health is
72:16 - actually number one key
72:17 - yep behind you know anything yes
72:21 - like getting into development so i was
72:23 - actually thinking either like
72:25 - um you know quality over quantity you
72:28 - know like i i don't have to make short
72:29 - videos but i just have like all these
72:31 - different ideas i even jot down on my
72:33 - phone on like
72:34 - what i can maybe dance too if anybody's
72:38 - you know if they want to have it like
72:40 - basic groove i could probably like
72:42 - post it up on the slack channel just to
72:44 - you know have fun and be
72:46 - i think i think it's a huge opportunity
72:49 - and i think it's really cool too like
72:51 - what you want to do so like
72:53 - if i was you i would be i would just be
72:55 - like dropping videos like
72:57 - you know five health tips for javascript
72:59 - developers
73:01 - you know seven tips to improve your
73:03 - posture for
73:04 - or like improve your productivity as a
73:06 - software developer and then like
73:07 - actually talk about health tips
73:10 - yeah i haven't thought of that yeah like
73:13 - it's like so
73:14 - key i i feel like it's so killer um
73:17 - i even think that if a company launched
73:21 - like literally chairs that i'm sitting
73:23 - in and they were called like
73:24 - one company just um optimized them for
73:28 - software developers and just branded it
73:29 - like
73:30 - chairs for react.js developers chairs
73:32 - for python developers
73:34 - oh my god like it would just blow up so
73:37 - i i think the same way as well included
73:40 - the logo of python
73:42 - that's what i'm saying it would be so
73:44 - epic it would crush so yeah so brian
73:46 - like if you actually do that where
73:48 - you're like made content like
73:50 - it just starts off with like one fitness
73:51 - tip for javascript developers
73:53 - and then like you showed them something
73:54 - you know i think that would be really
73:56 - cool
73:57 - yo that that's an inspiration thank you
73:59 - man yes beautiful
74:00 - i think tick tock is a is a really good
74:03 - platform for you especially if you can
74:05 - dance
74:05 - you can make bunches content on on there
74:08 - that um
74:10 - i created seven videos yesterday
74:13 - on tick tock produced seven pieces of
74:15 - content yesterday
74:17 - just to prove that you can and you can
74:19 - do it i
74:20 - and we did it in two and a half hours so
74:23 - it's very very possible and you guys can
74:25 - model what i'm doing here so these are
74:27 - the seven pieces of content i produced
74:29 - yesterday
74:30 - one i i had help two three
74:34 - four five six seven and take a look at
74:37 - this
74:38 - this channel was this channel was not
74:41 - getting many views 1300 1500 2800 right
74:44 - nothing
74:45 - i dropped to seven yesterday and look at
74:46 - this eleven thousand on this one
74:48 - thirty four hundred four thousand twenty
74:50 - nine hundred
74:51 - hundred and sixty five thousand
74:54 - thirty three thousand and twenty
74:56 - thousand so like check this one out
75:08 - right it's lit i love it
75:12 - right so like you guys can totally do
75:16 - that this one is five jobs that will
75:17 - make you a millionaire
75:19 - right and i just list out some jobs like
75:22 - lawyer
75:22 - and then some other one and some other
75:24 - one right this is something
75:26 - you don't need to be a genius to be able
75:27 - to do this it doesn't require that much
75:29 - effort it took me probably 15 to 17
75:31 - minutes to do it just got photos put
75:33 - them on my phone
75:34 - busted it out done so
75:37 - same thing like i think especially if
75:39 - you can
75:40 - dance you can make so much more content
75:43 - like extra content on tick tock that can
75:46 - do so damn well
75:49 - so quick question i actually have i
75:51 - actually post a few stuff on instagram
75:53 - too like those are pretty much for like
75:55 - my designs
75:56 - and you know yeah eventually you know
75:59 - later on i'm going to put like
76:00 - coding journey as well
76:03 - so you actually recommend me to put
76:06 - more videos on tick tock or like should
76:09 - i just use both
76:10 - uh if you can make videos that are under
76:12 - 30 seconds
76:13 - then that same video you'll post on ig
76:15 - reels that's how you're really going to
76:17 - explode on instagram
76:19 - if you just keep making instagram posts
76:20 - it's it just it's not gonna work
76:22 - it will take you like one year to get to
76:24 - a certain number of like
76:26 - hard work but if you just keep
76:28 - making
76:29 - uh ig reels
76:32 - then you can just keep taking those ig
76:34 - reels and put them on tick tock as well
76:36 - or vice versa 30 seconds
76:39 - that's the best i think that's the best
76:41 - way for the
76:43 - the way to fastest fastest growth
76:46 - i think that everybody should have a
76:47 - youtube channel because 15 seconds just
76:49 - isn't enough
76:50 - 30 seconds just isn't enough somebody
76:51 - isn't gonna pay you money
76:53 - because you gave them 30 seconds of
76:54 - value but i think it's the thing that
76:57 - can put you on the map
76:58 - the fastest way possible and your
77:00 - youtube is the foundation
77:03 - no doubt your ultimate foundation yeah
77:06 - so yeah
77:10 - like it's funny because like i thought
77:12 - about it yesterday right
77:14 - it's like we went to this like random
77:16 - massage place yesterday and i'm like man
77:18 - we're in beverly hills and this massage
77:20 - place is like really cheap it was like
77:22 - 40
77:23 - like 39 for like a 30 minute massage
77:25 - usually
77:26 - where i'm at it's like 300 or 400
77:29 - dollars you know for a 45 minute massage
77:31 - and i i don't do that i'm like that
77:32 - it's too
77:33 - like it's way too expensive um so
77:37 - my girlfriend and i we're there and i'm
77:38 - like seems suspicious but
77:40 - like okay we'll do it so it was like a
77:43 - nice you know
77:44 - white lady sitting at the front desk
77:46 - like really kind like booked our
77:48 - appointment and everything i'm like
77:49 - oh you know what like i might i might

78:23 - walked towards them just like

79:59 - seen anywhere man
80:00 - beautiful there you go all right so
80:02 - what's going on hey listen mine's more
80:04 - of a technical question oh by the way i
80:06 - joined the five uh day challenge for
80:08 - youtube i'm excited about that i
80:10 - downloaded the video leap app
80:12 - i'm pretty excited about that too
80:13 - because i use camtasia
80:15 - um but uh interested not for my phone
80:18 - just got the s20
80:19 - 5g so i'm excited about checking that
80:21 - out okay uh
80:22 - mine's technical question more on the
80:26 - uh what are you using for a mic and the
80:28 - software for
80:30 - uh your videos i know that you don't
80:32 - really need to get all that technical
80:34 - but i'd really like to know specifically
80:35 - because i've been i've been chasing
80:37 - stuff how much money you got
80:39 - well i'm not worried about the money i
80:42 - just like to know
80:43 - okay so um
80:46 - there is an option that is phenomenal
80:49 - for eight hundred dollars
80:50 - and then there's the option that's the
80:52 - exact same thing i used to make all of
80:54 - my videos a clever programmer they'll
80:56 - cost you about twenty five hundred three
80:58 - thousand dollars
80:59 - cool so okay so which one do you want to
81:02 - lean towards
81:03 - could you put them in the uh could you
81:05 - put that in the chat
81:08 - um i'll just take you to my amazon
81:11 - real quick
81:16 - i don't care it's like i'll get half a
81:19 - cent for him ordering at all
81:22 - um all right here we go
81:28 - what am i doing with my life all right
81:30 - cool
81:31 - oh i got all this stuff i didn't
81:33 - even open it yet
81:36 - all right so this is the new one
81:39 - so all my content that you see on my
81:42 - rafikaze channel
81:46 - the new one that i just started so let
81:49 - me refresh here
81:54 - and go to this all this content that i'm
81:57 - producing so like for example even if i
81:59 - show you
82:00 - this video here december is where i'm
82:03 - how to get your first 1 000 subscribers
82:06 - let's talk about it
82:10 - [Music]
82:12 - so all of this is shot with this
82:15 - right here that
82:18 - like this exact thing and you know if i
82:20 - want to circle everything
82:22 - that's that's it okay so this
82:26 - i really like it's not too expensive i
82:29 - can carry around my camera
82:30 - really easily everywhere with me and the
82:33 - cool
82:34 - really cool thing that makes it easy is
82:36 - the fact that the mic
82:38 - that it comes with is actually really
82:40 - good
82:41 - so i've never seen a camera that comes
82:42 - with a mic on top of it that's
82:44 - really good so that was really
82:46 - surprising for me
82:47 - so this is the camera for that and it
82:50 - just makes the creation side so
82:52 - much easier for me and then the other
82:55 - one
82:56 - you know if you're thinking about like
82:58 - the a more
83:00 - fancier setup which i don't know i just
83:03 - i
83:04 - want things that make it easy for
83:06 - creators to create
83:07 - so i have a gh5 which i shot the rest of
83:09 - the stuff with
83:11 - um you you if you want you can go with
83:12 - that too so this is a
83:14 - it's a gh5 and i
83:17 - that i didn't order from amazon so i
83:20 - can't like show you that in my amazon
83:21 - cart
83:22 - sure but it's a gh5 and then it has some
83:25 - lens that comes
83:26 - with it so that's um
83:29 - that's what that is if you are about to
83:31 - order it let me know and i'll be able to
83:33 - give you the exact specs and everything
83:35 - like that i'll i'll just have to look at
83:36 - it look it up
83:38 - gotcha appreciate that cause thanks
83:39 - mm-hmm
83:41 - yep you got it all right uh let me see
83:46 - guys questions you guys i believe that
83:49 - um this your phone's camera is going to
83:51 - be perfect i
83:52 - i actually agree with priyanshu like if
83:56 - if it's stopping you to create content i
83:58 - would highly recommend to remove any
84:01 - barrier from creating content so
84:03 - if expenses or whatever here's
84:06 - you know guys you know what's better
84:08 - than like
84:09 - no content some content
84:13 - content so like i'd rather you have
84:17 - a video that you think is really crappy
84:20 - that's way better than you not having a
84:22 - video at all
84:24 - like let me ask you guys would you
84:25 - rather have no food in a day or some
84:27 - food that maybe isn't even that good
84:30 - some food some food right what would
84:33 - happen if for a week you just had
84:34 - no food
84:40 - that's what's happening to you every
84:42 - week you don't produce content
84:47 - that's what's happening to all the
84:48 - opportunities on the upside that you can
84:50 - create for yourself and for your life
84:53 - so like i want you guys to take it
84:55 - seriously you know like and actually
84:56 - enjoy it not just like oh my god it's
84:58 - this crazy thing
85:00 - but like actually enjoy it so that's why
85:03 - even if it's bad content or if it's bad
85:05 - food you're still gonna eat it still
85:07 - produce it
85:08 - and then you can get fancier over time
85:10 - the thing that like i
85:11 - always hate thinking about is like
85:15 - i never want to be that like white guy
85:19 - in his 40s that's out of shape that
85:21 - wants to play tennis for the first time
85:23 - in his life but needs the perfect
85:25 - equipment the perfect tennis racket
85:27 - has like the white headband like on his
85:30 - head
85:30 - and then like goes to play you know what
85:32 - i mean like needs the fanciest equipment
85:34 - i never want to be that person who needs
85:38 - all of those things i almost want to
85:40 - like work my way up to it
85:42 - so if you're thinking about getting
85:43 - really fancy things almost make it a
85:46 - game for yourself and be like okay let
85:47 - me prove it to myself by producing seven
85:49 - videos with my phone
85:51 - okay now before i get the 2500 camera
85:53 - let me prove that i can do this with
85:54 - like my
85:55 - you know a 500 camera or 800 camera can
85:59 - i do this
85:59 - and then go from there
86:06 - all right guys um

86:58 - that pretty much everybody signed up um
87:01 - any more
87:02 - i want to take on more questions so give
87:03 - me one second here i'm looking at the
87:05 - questions that you guys have
87:07 - i'm reading them as well
87:15 - do you think it's a good idea to be a
87:17 - tutor as a beginner sharing that's what
87:19 - i
87:20 - did you know i just as soon as i learned
87:24 - something i just started teaching it
87:26 - um i also got
87:29 - yeah i also got a client to sign up
87:33 - for my coaching for youtube as soon as i
87:36 - started learning youtube
87:37 - so before i even had 3 000 subscribers i
87:40 - don't know if you guys know but i took
87:42 - on a client
87:43 - that paid me 2 000 a month to do youtube
87:45 - with me
87:47 - for four calls four calls two thousand
87:50 - dollars a month
87:51 - um under three thousand subscribers
87:54 - because
87:55 - i'm like hey look you see my results i
87:57 - have 3000 subscribers but i'm growing
87:59 - fast
88:00 - i am like learning this stuff so you can
88:02 - learn it with me if you want
88:04 - because it's going to take my time this
88:05 - is what i'm going to charge you because
88:07 - i know the value of it
88:08 - you want to do it and he's like yeah
88:10 - i'll do it okay cool
88:11 - so then i just now four years later and
88:14 - like
88:15 - he actually has an amazing youtube
88:17 - channel with over 10 000 subscribers
88:19 - now we're blowing him up on tick tock he
88:21 - just like broke 30 000 followers on tick
88:23 - tock
88:24 - so like this year 2021 end of 2021 he's
88:27 - gonna have like a really
88:28 - solid incredible brand like a successful
88:30 - brand
88:31 - so i don't let those voices
88:34 - you know stop me ever like if i'm a
88:37 - beginner it doesn't matter
88:38 - can am i like half a step ahead of
88:40 - somebody if i am i'm just go for it
88:42 - if you don't see guys always talk about
88:45 - in your webinars is so powerful like
88:46 - many people underestimate it and think
88:48 - it is
88:48 - over uh exaggerated right trust me it
88:51 - isn't yeah
88:52 - it literally isn't like if i know or
88:54 - like even if i know like
88:56 - for loops and functions i can teach it
88:58 - to someone else
89:00 - it's real it's real yeah so it is what
89:03 - it is
89:04 - um you can't convince everyone i tried
89:07 - to
89:07 - like i really tried to for a really long
89:09 - time now i don't
89:11 - just because like i want to give my
89:13 - energy to people who are already
89:15 - convinced
89:15 - because then it just drives so much
89:17 - results for them
89:19 - um and so and like nothing bad on the
89:21 - people who aren't like
89:23 - you know everybody has their own opinion
89:25 - so that's okay too but i just want to
89:26 - like keep moving forward
89:29 - all right brian you got one follower
89:31 - nice stephen
89:33 - okay dope yeah kazi i had a few
89:37 - questions right yeah go for it
89:39 - yeah so uh one question that always pops
89:42 - into any of
89:42 - any beginner's mind uh it was one of the
89:44 - questions that even brought me inside of
89:46 - my mind
89:47 - but uh the main question is that is
89:49 - youtube a stable
89:50 - source of income um no
89:55 - [Music]
89:57 - yeah that that is exactly what i thought
89:59 - because
90:00 - it's just a platform right and any
90:02 - platform can die off so
90:03 - it's not every i'll tell you something
90:06 - can you get fired from a job
90:09 - yeah can a client decide to not work
90:11 - with you anymore
90:13 - yeah okay like
90:16 - can all these like right now we have 45
90:19 - people
90:20 - can all of the 45 people decide to
90:23 - leave the call right this second
90:28 - yep yes right can a
90:31 - like like asteroid hit us and the planet
90:35 - gets
90:35 - destroyed i mean there's a lot like
90:39 - yes it can really bad things can happen
90:42 - um a lot of things like everything
90:44 - there's a amount of uncertainty
90:46 - i believe that the biggest areas of
90:49 - growth happen
90:49 - where you are willing to take that risk
90:52 - that's why you have such a high upside
90:54 - that's that's only why you know
90:57 - um so the more i like for me what makes
91:01 - me a great entrepreneur
91:03 - like really really good is that
91:06 - i
91:06 - have very high risk tolerance
91:10 - um and i come in my element when things
91:12 - become really vague
91:13 - and really chaotic and everyone starts
91:15 - to freak out
91:18 - so like even right now everybody at
91:19 - cleverprogrammer is freaking the
91:21 - out because i'm like hiring people so
91:22 - fast
91:23 - and i used to try to convince everybody
91:25 - like no it's a good idea i have like
91:26 - really long conversations with them to
91:28 - really see my perspective
91:30 - now i don't try to convince everybody i
91:32 - know what i need to do
91:34 - like i i understand it i get it i get
91:36 - what needs to happen
91:38 - you know it's like a captain of a navy
91:40 - seal team or something like he
91:42 - knows what he's doing with
91:43 - his soldiers with his team what is so
91:45 - like
91:46 - the more risk you can take and the more
91:48 - the most valuable skill i think you guys
91:50 - can teach yourself
91:51 - is willing to play in really vague
91:55 - areas where there's really high risk and
91:58 - uncertainty
91:59 - but to me honestly if you think about it
92:01 - like what is the risk
92:04 - you yeah you spent a year making things
92:07 - that you enjoyed making
92:11 - oh my god what a risk and also
92:14 - meanwhile you can you can possibly
92:16 - generate money from it
92:18 - yeah and in the meantime outside of this
92:20 - i'll tell you something and in the
92:21 - meantime outside of this
92:23 - most of us aren't going to do much
92:25 - anyway
92:27 - like what's the alternative like what is
92:29 - something that's gonna be so
92:30 - great that you're gonna do then like
92:33 - actually make an investment into your
92:35 - brand into getting your
92:37 - self out there so here's what i will say
92:41 - right
92:43 - the biggest thing that happens that out
92:45 - of all of this the worst case scenario
92:47 - looks like now you have unlimited job
92:49 - opportunity
92:49 - that's the worst case scenario that
92:51 - happens when you start investing into
92:52 - your own brand
92:54 - that's the worst thing that happens you
92:56 - now have unlimited job opportunity
92:58 - do you guys think i'll ask you guys this
93:01 - okay if just clever programmer and
93:03 - everything
93:04 - died right and we just had to quit and
93:06 - shut off
93:07 - everything do you guys think
93:10 - that if i just asked everybody a clever
93:13 - programmer if there was a job
93:14 - opportunity
93:15 - for me that i could get hired
93:19 - yes is that possible yes
93:23 - you know no client will reject you and
93:24 - no one so like
93:28 - i and i just need one person to say they
93:30 - will hire me right so if
93:32 - i'm really looking for security i just
93:34 - need one person to say yeah like they'll
93:36 - work with me
93:39 - so like that's the worst thing that
93:41 - happens when you invest in your own
93:42 - personal brand
93:43 - you actually get unlimited job
93:46 - opportunity
93:47 - you know that's the worst case scenario
93:48 - best case scenario is you get more
93:50 - income you get way more opportunity
93:52 - brian starts getting hit up like here's
93:54 - the future right
93:55 - brian does stuff does stuff does nothing
93:58 - happens nothing happens nothing happens
93:59 - nothing happens nothing happens nothing
94:00 - happens i mean
94:01 - things start happening and now one
94:04 - person reaches out to bran
94:05 - is like hey man like you know you're
94:06 - doing really cool stuff and
94:08 - you know if you promoted a bang energy
94:10 - drink with your dance like
94:12 - um we could give you like 200 for one
94:14 - tick tock post
94:15 - all of a sudden brian's like holy
94:19 - 200 dollars for one tick tock post the
94:22 - thing i was gonna do for free
94:23 - anyway okay 200 times four if they
94:27 - give me four sponsored posts this month
94:29 - that's eight hundred dollars
94:32 - what if i got another sponsor and i got
94:34 - four videos with them
94:36 - oh that's sixteen hundred dollars
94:39 - what if i got just one more sponsor
94:42 - that's 2400
94:43 - i can probably quit and try to survive
94:45 - off of that
94:47 - damn then what happens up
94:50 - as his followers grow as more
94:52 - opportunities starting to happen
94:54 - right literally there'll be people who
94:55 - are like hey dude you're making content
94:58 - on like software developers
95:00 - are you interested in a software
95:01 - development job
95:03 - brian's like oh now i have a job
95:06 - opportunity and three sponsorship things
95:08 - that i'm
95:08 - thinking about hmm let me keep thinking
95:11 - here
95:11 - now i have like now i have a lot of
95:13 - opportunity that's pretty cool let me
95:14 - just keep going
95:16 - he keeps going he keeps going see what
95:17 - i'm saying now brian
95:19 - i was like should i launch my own course
95:21 - that would be pretty cool
95:22 - now really cool conversations are
95:24 - happening
95:25 - brian sits with his friend and now the
95:27 - conversation isn't like hey man what's
95:29 - going
95:29 - now he's like yo i got a sponsorship
95:31 - thing i also got a software development
95:33 - job opportunity
95:34 - and then like now i'm thinking about
95:36 - launching my own course like what do you
95:37 - think
95:38 - and now that's what they're back and
95:40 - forth talking about
95:42 - literally that's how my entire
95:43 - conversation is translated from my best
95:45 - friends like
95:46 - that's exactly how it happened that's
95:48 - and that's what i'm saying
95:49 - it's true it's true so it happens
95:53 - right and that's how you now are
95:54 - creating content now people are
95:56 - following you now people are paying you
95:58 - so like this can happen but
96:01 - in order to be able to do that you just
96:03 - have to invest in yourself in terms of
96:04 - like
96:05 - if you're looking for 100 stability
96:07 - there's really like
96:08 - nothing that's 100 stable and if you
96:11 - think a job is 100 stable like
96:13 - it's really not right it's like it's a
96:16 - company can go bankrupt and they have to
96:18 - fire you right or maybe they just decide
96:20 - you're not a good fit anymore
96:23 - so it's an illusion that it's like a
96:25 - permanent thing but it's really not
96:27 - so like why not do a thing on the side
96:30 - that you really really enjoy you can
96:31 - still do your work
96:32 - like i created my youtube channel with
96:34 - 30 minutes to an hour
96:36 - how many of us have one free hour in a
96:38 - day just raise your hands if you're
96:40 - one free 30 minutes to one hour in a day
96:46 - so like you can with that one
96:49 - hour you can actually create something
96:51 - completely on the side
96:53 - that's like your own that's an
96:54 - investment in you forever
96:56 - and you can't go wrong with this because
96:58 - it's an investment in you
97:00 - and i'll tell you something else even if
97:02 - here's another things okay
97:04 - priyanshu it's way more it's a million
97:07 - times more reliable of an income
97:09 - youtube than a job ever
97:12 - is and i never even consider jobs to be
97:16 - like
97:16 - something that i should even aim for i
97:18 - never consider
97:19 - right so it's like youtube pays you and
97:21 - even if youtube died tomorrow
97:23 - people will still look up clever
97:25 - programmer
97:27 - right people will still look it up
97:29 - people will still try to find it
97:31 - ultimately it is the fastest way to make
97:34 - human relationships with people
97:36 - and as long as you can do that you can
97:38 - have unlimited job opportunity
97:40 - income opportunity whatever it is that
97:41 - you're looking for that's all it is
97:44 - cool so that's kind of my answer on that
97:48 - end um okay atharva hey something is
97:51 - wrong with my instagram i uploaded two
97:53 - posts daily and i get 10 followers
97:54 - sometimes and
97:56 - those are disappeared the next day and i
97:57 - cannot grow my instagram my impressions
97:59 - are going down do you think it's because
98:01 - of two posts a day a tharva do you want
98:02 - to jump on
98:06 - i don't know can you hear me hey how's
98:08 - it going
98:11 - it's perfect i cannot speak louder okay
98:14 - go ahead so something is wrong
98:18 - um like i was going one post a day and i
98:21 - i got like
98:22 - 70 likes on my post but from like two
98:26 - days i have started posting
98:27 - two posts a day and everything is just
98:30 - going wrong i don't know what's
98:32 - happening okay
98:34 - what does it mean when you say
98:35 - everything is going wrong
98:38 - i mean the posts are not shown to many
98:40 - people and my analytics are just going
98:42 - down like
98:43 - impressions and everything okay um
98:47 - how many people are
98:57 - oh this post is gonna do well all right
99:00 - hold on let's go to
99:01 - a tharva right there
99:12 - okay so how many posts are we in right
99:14 - now 29 posts okay
99:16 - dude you're 473 followers for 29
99:19 - posts
99:21 - [Music]
99:24 - okay you're at
99:26 - look at this um
99:29 - did you do did you get fake followers
99:33 - no at any point no
99:36 - okay uh did you do follow for follow
99:38 - type of thing where you went on people's
99:40 - channels and told them to follow you
99:43 - no okay so these
99:46 - why are you following 353 people
99:50 - because this was the person that
99:51 - recorded before so okay okay got it okay
99:53 - so you were just
99:54 - watching people and just following them
99:56 - i'm sure you probably followed okay cool
99:58 - all right um
100:01 - bro i think i'm gonna tell you something
100:04 - this happens um i'll just show you
100:08 - my youtube okay
100:12 - so here's what i want you to look at
100:14 - switch to clever programmer
100:19 - this is the craziest thing about
100:20 - marketing which is like really
100:22 - unsettling for most people and it freaks
100:24 - them the out
100:26 - um it's like
100:30 - it freaks you out because so much
100:32 - changes so
100:33 - fast all the time it's kind of
100:35 - unbelievable so like look at this right
100:38 - boom like we blew up like start of
100:40 - january we're like getting 27 000 views
100:42 - 27
100:43 - 000 views and then like boom we got 125
100:45 - 000 views and we're live oh my god this
100:47 - is crazy
100:48 - like this was the the start of 2020
100:52 - right
100:52 - and then like look at this it just died
100:54 - no matter what we produce no matter what
100:56 - we did it just stayed like this
100:58 - and then right around here look at this
101:02 - this is when sonny and i were doing
101:04 - those live streams
101:06 - so it was going crazy during that
101:10 - and then you can see it has this crazy
101:12 - drop-off even now that we're going live
101:14 - and doing a lot of the similar things we
101:15 - were doing before
101:16 - like look at how much we're posting nine
101:18 - videos in one week nine in one week nine
101:20 - in one week nine
101:21 - but you can't it's hard to go more than
101:23 - this
101:24 - it's going down right now if i show you
101:28 - the trajectory of its lifetime
101:31 - look at this growth growth growth growth
101:33 - growth then goes down
101:35 - then grows a little bit more grows down
101:38 - massive stupid growth growth grow grows
101:41 - massive stupid growth goes down
101:43 - it's it's chaos but if you look
101:47 - at the trajectory is it up or down
101:50 - it's going up finally yep so
101:53 - uh you're thinking too close you're
101:56 - looking too
101:57 - closely at every movement that's
101:59 - happening
102:00 - you're too close like if i
102:03 - zoom in at this point i'd be depressed
102:04 - because everything is failing
102:06 - it's almost like you're looking at the
102:08 - stock market every single day you
102:09 - shouldn't do that
102:10 - yes so like you're looking at it too
102:12 - closely like you're you're
102:13 - just zoomed in right here and you're
102:15 - just like your whole focus is on this
102:18 - but it's impossible for you to see this
102:21 - and this
102:22 - because it probably hasn't happened yet
102:24 - right so
102:27 - you are here my friend and you're zoomed
102:30 - in all the way
102:33 - you just got to zoom out and just keep
102:35 - producing valuable content
102:39 - got it okay and then try different
102:43 - strategies like
102:44 - sometimes the that worked before is
102:46 - not gonna work again like some of our
102:47 - videos that we thought was gonna get a
102:48 - million views got like
102:50 - 5 000 views and stopped so ig
102:53 - reels is the game right now i didn't see
102:56 - that you're on it
102:58 - i don't see any ig real videos from you
103:01 - yeah i'm planning on that very soon
103:03 - right so like ig reels
103:05 - is a big way for you to grow so you
103:08 - gotta
103:08 - try a lot of those things and be careful
103:12 - about your internal dialogue because if
103:13 - you're like i don't know why everything
103:16 - is wrong
103:17 - what is he going to pay attention to
103:19 - guys once he asks that question
103:21 - why is everything wrong with my channel
103:24 - what is he gonna start focusing on once
103:25 - he asks that question
103:27 - is he gonna focus on all the great
103:29 - things that are happening is he gonna
103:31 - start no he starts to focus on every
103:32 - single follower that goes off and then
103:34 - he wonders that uh
103:35 - okay maybe i'm going wrong over here
103:37 - maybe i'm going wrong with your hand
103:38 - isn't focused on you know like um this
103:40 - post got me this good
103:42 - yeah so that's that's what's happening
103:45 - at tharva
103:45 - right now it's like the focus is too
103:48 - much
103:49 - on the things that are wrong and that's
103:51 - a bad question to ask my friend
103:53 - so like you're gonna put yourself in a
103:55 - mentally a really poor place
103:58 - and when you put yourself mentally in a
104:00 - poor place
104:01 - are you gonna feel less or more inspired
104:03 - to make more content at darva
104:06 - less so like the game is
104:10 - not worrying about the follower account
104:12 - and producing valuable
104:16 - okay and right and then if you want to
104:19 - think tactically you need some tactics
104:21 - to get out of it bro start posting more
104:23 - ig reels
104:26 - but not everything is wrong bro 29 posts
104:29 - 473 followers get the out of here
104:31 - like
104:31 - it took me a half a year to get
104:34 - my first 473 followers it's a lot of
104:36 - followers
104:38 - so you know and even the amount of likes
104:40 - you have is actually quite a bit
104:42 - for what you got going on now the game
104:44 - is
104:46 - you know different tactics like you know
104:48 - the same stuff that works stops working
104:50 - and you have to
104:50 - always be changing so it's like i was
104:53 - producing content and i'm
104:54 - always every day looking at what's
104:56 - happening every day looking at what's
104:58 - happening and i keep trying different
104:59 - tactics different strategies
105:01 - and like now i'm realizing reels kill it
105:04 - so i'm like guys
105:05 - let's try to post five to ten
105:08 - reels a day
105:10 - if you spent three hours focused focused
105:14 - working hard you should be able to
105:16 - produce three to five
105:18 - ig tick tock slash reels a day
105:22 - and then if you don't grow then then
105:24 - come back and talk to me then something
105:26 - is wrong you know
105:28 - but it's but it's it's literally the
105:30 - equivalent of like giving you the advice
105:32 - of like if you want to be healthy
105:33 - sleep more and eat more so like right
105:35 - now if you did that and you made more
105:37 - tick tocks and ig reels like there's
105:39 - it's gonna be yeah really hard for you
105:42 - to not grow it's almost like you know
105:44 - if you take if you take about fitness
105:46 - he's almost focusing on the daughter of
105:47 - one or two that's growing and
105:49 - yeah and not on his overall mental peace
105:52 - peace and is physical
105:53 - yeah like even even when you do a lot of
105:55 - physical fitness stuff right it's hard
105:56 - to see the
105:58 - growth every day that is happening it's
106:00 - hard to see every day the transition
106:02 - that's taking place in your body
106:04 - but over time you can actually see the
106:07 - difference that it make
106:08 - it's making it's very hard to see if
106:10 - you're trying to look every day like
106:11 - my six-pack here yet oh is it 60 is
106:15 - it here yet
106:16 - god so like it's not gonna be there
106:20 - if you just keep trying to look at it
106:21 - every single day
106:23 - just need to like do the process
106:26 - but while you're doing the process get
106:28 - smart and use smart tactics too
106:30 - so like use ig reels if you're trying to
106:32 - grow on instagram
106:33 - and if you're not then you're in the
106:35 - grandpa stage and that's why you're not
106:36 - growing
106:38 - so my my two cents on that
106:42 - um okay beautiful beautiful
106:45 - so i'm gonna see some reels from you
106:47 - this week at tharva
106:49 - yeah um
106:52 - oh new boston made a video
106:56 - i did not know that devin
107:00 - yeah it was like maybe like a couple
107:03 - weeks ago
107:04 - like my facebook was blowing up over
107:06 - like oh my god is he back
107:09 - yeah oh yeah yeah i mean yeah the new
107:11 - boston is freaking awesome
107:13 - oh tharva i just thought about something
107:14 - else i want to share with you
107:16 - so my clever cozy thing is big
107:19 - uh on instagram so whatever i make is
107:22 - gonna get a lot of views
107:24 - but my rafikaze which is like the
107:26 - personal brand side of things is not
107:28 - huge
107:28 - so when i drop stuff i don't get a lot
107:30 - of views like i'm in the same boat as
107:32 - you
107:33 - so remember when you dropped stuff you
107:35 - got 40 so think about this i have
107:37 - 1800 followers and i
107:40 - when i drop stuff i was getting the same
107:42 - amount as you so like
107:44 - right over here i started dropping
107:45 - content 253 video views
107:47 - 38 on this 63 on this 50 on this
107:51 - you see what i'm saying right two
107:54 - comments
107:55 - zero comments zero comments very similar
107:57 - to exactly where you're at right now
107:59 - yeah
108:01 - my video is getting 253 views 269 views
108:03 - so like look at what i did
108:05 - 294 views cool then i made ig reel
108:09 - and now look at what happened when i
108:11 - made ig reel
108:13 - look at the amount of views that this
108:16 - got
108:18 - as many followers you have yeah look at
108:20 - how many views this got
108:22 - while my other videos got 200 views
108:26 - now the trick is i model the people who
108:29 - are making the best reels
108:30 - and then i made something similar to
108:32 - that so you gotta model like
108:34 - the things that are working really
108:35 - really well and then make those
108:37 - but like it works when you do it right
108:39 - it works
108:42 - you didn't know i need to make reels yes
108:44 - you do need to make
108:45 - reels and you know for the coding
108:47 - channel just follow
108:49 - look at the reels that we're making you
108:51 - know and if you get in a good flow of it
108:53 - yeah like look at this right like this
108:55 - one um
108:56 - this one blew the up look at this
108:58 - one
109:01 - [Music]
109:04 - i love this one what's popping
109:07 - don't mind me just watching
109:11 - that's it
109:17 - there we go that was hard to quit out of
109:19 - it but like
109:20 - this one just blew up 300 most of my
109:23 - videos get no more than like few
109:25 - thousand views max
109:26 - 300 000 views that tells me that's what
109:29 - i need to pay more attention to
109:30 - so that's where like that's what makes
109:32 - me really good as a ceo like i'm not
109:35 - religious to how things work i'm
109:37 - very religious to results so like as
109:39 - soon as i see the 300 000
109:41 - i told my entire team like everybody
109:43 - should be producing
109:44 - five tick tocks a day
109:48 - like guys let's let's literally produce
109:50 - 15 to 20 tick tock slash ig reels
109:53 - and then let's just see what the
109:54 - happens but i just have a weird feeling
109:56 - that we're gonna
109:57 - blow up like we're gonna have the
109:58 - fastest growth we've seen
110:00 - to be honest it's actually not even that
110:02 - hard uh like it's
110:04 - what i see is that whenever i'm making
110:06 - those uh carousel posts
110:07 - what happens is that i have to focus a
110:09 - lot on the content itself and
110:11 - whenever i speak about it it's always
110:13 - very fast right because i'm just gonna
110:15 - say it and then i'm just gonna record
110:17 - myself i'm gonna be like
110:18 - hey everyone and how is it how's it
110:19 - going everything like that right it's
110:21 - not
110:22 - so here's the thing with all of this
110:24 - stuff
110:25 - go and look at the person that you
110:27 - resonate with
110:28 - you would like to make content like them
110:31 - and they're blowing up
110:33 - then model it very closely and make it
110:35 - in your
110:36 - field so for example one of the people
110:39 - that works with us amanath
110:41 - he helped me make an amazing ig reel
110:44 - that killed it
110:45 - do you guys want to see the work that i
110:47 - had to do
110:48 - you guys want to see the work i had to
110:49 - do for this reel that crushed it
110:52 - yes here's what i had to do okay watch
110:55 - me
110:56 - very closely because i'm about to show
110:58 - you how i got
111:00 - a hundred thousand views okay so i'm
111:02 - gonna show you guys a secret
111:05 - all right here's how it goes
111:17 - that's what i had to do guys i hate you
111:19 - okay can i get a rounding
111:21 - like clap ovation can i please get an
111:23 - ovation like please
111:25 - let's get that going
111:30 - so that's what i had to do and now let
111:33 - me you guys want to see the actual reel
111:35 - yes i saw it guys
111:39 - libraries right no no no no
111:46 - no
111:56 - that's what the i'm talking about
112:00 - like
112:02 - that's what i had to do i'm more bad
112:04 - that that works
112:05 - there's a similar one that's what i'm
112:07 - saying there's a similar one that like i
112:09 - made
112:09 - that like got 2.8 million views and it's
112:12 - just like me finger-pointing
112:13 - in different areas i i think i prefer
112:17 - doing
112:17 - tik-tok content rather than youtube
112:19 - content i don't know why i just started
112:21 - so do that
112:22 - then do tick-tock do do the thing that
112:25 - you really enjoy
112:26 - like really enjoying india that's the
112:29 - only problem yeah yeah
112:30 - yeah that's a huge problem right now
112:33 - yeah
112:33 - so like but ig reels is ig reels
112:36 - instagram has like guys tick tock uh
112:40 - i feel like what what happened to what
112:42 - what instagram did to snapchat like
112:44 - there used to be this app called
112:45 - snapchat
112:46 - that just like died when instagram
112:48 - stories came out
112:49 - i feel like the similar thing is going
112:51 - to happen to tick tock in the long run
112:53 - because instagram is now tick-tock like
112:56 - literally instagram is tick tock the
112:58 - middle button is tick tock
113:00 - it's called ig reels and like you scroll
113:03 - through and it's literally tick tock so
113:06 - you can use ig reels and ig reels is
113:08 - worldwide and you can use it everywhere
113:10 - right
113:11 - um why i believe in content where
113:14 - there's like youtube because there's now
113:16 - real
113:16 - depth to it and now you can go a lot
113:18 - deeper with youtube
113:20 - with tick tock and all of this stuff you
113:21 - can get awareness really fast
113:24 - so that's really like the key thing
113:27 - there um
113:29 - awesome so yeah that's what i'm saying
113:30 - like it's not a lot of work what we have
113:32 - to do is just modeling what works is the
113:34 - really hard thing so guys
113:36 - how was the session for today how'd you
