00:00 - hey you what is up how's it going this's
00:03 - Kazi from clever programmer calm welcome
00:06 - to part 6 of this django tutorial
00:10 - awesome epic series in this video we're
00:17 - gonna be covering this is actually gonna
00:19 - be much shorter than the other ones I
00:21 - hope and I think we're gonna be covering
00:24 - essentially how static files it work in
00:26 - Django ok and how you can use them to
00:29 - customize your apps look and feel ok so
00:34 - without any further ado let's jump right
00:37 - into it okay so writing your first app
00:40 - part 6 right so how what are we doing
00:43 - now now we've built a tested web poll
00:46 - application if you haven't done that go
00:48 - back to part 5 if you haven't done part
00:50 - 5 go back to fart part 4 make sure
00:53 - you're following this in order and now
00:58 - will now add a stylesheet and an image
01:00 - ok so aside from HTML that your app
01:04 - generates right and shows which is you
01:07 - need your front-end so far the voting
01:10 - thing that we have or it shows some text
01:12 - with radio buttons your website needs to
01:14 - be able to do other things too like show
01:16 - people images or pictures of cats or
01:19 - blog post images it also needs to be
01:22 - able to serve up JavaScript if you have
01:25 - any JavaScript right so for example if
01:27 - you don't know what JavaScript is it's
01:28 - totally fine but like any time you're
01:30 - clicking a button and it like pops up a
01:32 - menu kind of thing that's usually
01:34 - JavaScript going on there ok
01:36 - if you click something like a pop-up
01:38 - comes up that's JavaScript JavaScript is
01:41 - pretty much everywhere so your website
01:42 - needs to be able to show some JavaScript
01:44 - and it also needs to be able to serve
01:49 - CSS okay which is it's called Cass
01:52 - stands for cascading style sheet and you
01:54 - use this to stylize your app and make it
01:58 - look cool and beautiful ok and yeah so
02:03 - that's usually what's necessary to
02:04 - complete a web page in Django we refer
02:08 - to these files as static files now for
02:12 - small projects
02:13 - right this isn't a big deal because you
02:15 - can just keep the static file somewhere
02:17 - where your web server can find it
02:20 - however in bigger projects especially
02:22 - those comprised of like multiple apps
02:24 - right so if you have multiple apps like
02:26 - polls and blog and e-commerce like
02:29 - whatever dealing with the multiple sets
02:31 - of static files provided but each
02:33 - application starts to get tricky
02:35 - that's why Django dot contribut static
02:38 - files is there for you if you're a
02:40 - beginner don't worry about this part too
02:43 - much but this is for more advanced
02:45 - people mentioning this part okay
02:47 - otherwise I'd kind of skip over it it
02:51 - collects static files from each of your
02:53 - applications in any other places you
02:55 - specify into a single location that can
02:57 - be that can easily be served in
02:59 - production okay so now let's get to
03:01 - customizing your apps look and feel so
03:05 - first we're gonna need to create a
03:07 - directory called static in your polls
03:09 - directory okay so let's go ahead and do
03:11 - that I'm gonna open up atom and we will
03:15 - go in our polls hopefully you can see
03:17 - that on the left hand side I don't know
03:19 - how to make that bigger so I'm sorry
03:21 - about that but yeah we're gonna go
03:24 - inside of our polls and inside of our
03:26 - polls I think this is where it wants us
03:28 - to make it so I'm gonna right click this
03:30 - polls not the templates one so right
03:33 - right click here create a new folder and
03:37 - call it static done
03:44 - okay cool and for those of you wondering
03:48 - like how do I switch like that it's
03:50 - command and tab and on Windows that's
03:52 - Alt + tab
03:55 - cool
03:56 - Django will look for static files there
03:59 - similarly to how Django finds templates
04:01 - inside pulls temple pull slash templates
04:03 - so you know how there's like pull slash
04:05 - templates in Django automatically looks
04:07 - for templates there well just like that
04:10 - for your static files Django is gonna
04:12 - look inside of your folder static okay
04:15 - so Django static files setting contains
04:17 - a list of finders and know how to
04:19 - discover static files from various
04:21 - sources one of the defaults is AB
04:23 - directories finder which looks for a
04:24 - static subdirectory in each of the
04:28 - installed apps
04:29 - okay so Django will automatically look
04:34 - for a folder called static under each of
04:37 - the installed apps ok so right now we
04:40 - have polls as one of our apps that we
04:42 - created and remember to install this app
04:44 - we had to do this line in our settings
04:47 - file understand installed apps and then
04:52 - now Django is able to find its static
04:56 - folder if you have another app again
05:01 - like a blog app and you have static
05:03 - folder under there and you install the
05:05 - blog app then you'll be able to then
05:06 - Django will be able to find the blogs
05:09 - blog apps static files okay like images
05:12 - JavaScript CSS those are all considered
05:15 - static files alright the admin uses the
05:20 - same directory structure for its static
05:23 - files cool
05:24 - so admin site works the same way with in
05:28 - the static directory you have just
05:30 - created a create another directory
05:31 - called polls so inside of static we're
05:34 - gonna create another directory and we're
05:36 - going to call it polls okay so kind of
05:40 - like how you have polls templates polls
05:42 - you're gonna have polls static polls
05:45 - okay similar and then inside of here
05:48 - we're gonna create a file called styles
05:50 - that CSS I'm gonna do new file and I'll
05:52 - do style dot CSS just like that okay so
05:56 - this is our CSS
06:00 - again in the command line if you haven't
06:03 - activated your virtual environment make
06:05 - sure to do kondeh or sorry source
06:08 - activate my sights if you haven't done
06:11 - that just in case you need to do
06:12 - something in the command line which
06:13 - you're not gonna in this video I don't
06:15 - think because of how the app directories
06:19 - finder static files finder works you can
06:23 - refer to this data file in Django simply
06:25 - as pull slash styles that CSS similar to
06:28 - how you reference the path for templates
06:30 - so remember how for templates you just
06:31 - go pull slash index dot HTML well for
06:34 - this is pull slash style dot CSS okay
06:37 - and for name spacing it's just like
06:42 - templates so the same reason why you put
06:45 - templates under of the same reason why
06:50 - you make a new folder called polls under
06:53 - templates is the same reason why you
06:55 - create a another folder called polls
06:57 - under static it's so then if you have
06:59 - multiple different apps there's no
07:01 - collision based on like you having the
07:03 - same name for any of your CSS files or
07:07 - any of your HTML files that's what
07:11 - they're saying here okay now we're gonna
07:13 - do some fun CSS stuff okay and we're
07:16 - gonna keep it pretty simple so in our
07:18 - style that CSS what I'm basically saying
07:20 - is that any link tag under a bullet
07:26 - point or a listed thing color it green
07:29 - okay so a stands for is like your link
07:33 - tags anything that contains a link
07:35 - basically returning for now we're
07:38 - turning almost all of our links on our
07:40 - current site Green next add the
07:45 - following at the top of polls slash
07:47 - templates slash polls slash index dot
07:50 - HTML so we're gonna go in our templates
07:52 - pulls index dot HTML and at the top or
07:56 - we're gonna add is we're gonna say load
07:58 - static so we're gonna add that right
08:00 - here load static so what this is now
08:03 - able to do is load our static files and
08:06 - then right here I'm gonna add this so
08:10 - I'm create a
08:12 - creating a link to a stylesheet the type
08:14 - is text slash CSS and the link is this
08:18 - now I'm using the link in a dynamic way
08:22 - this is the best way to link it instead
08:25 - of like hard coding the actual path and
08:28 - you just say polo slash style dot CSS
08:31 - okay that's how we refer to it and
08:33 - that's pretty much it okay so now let's
08:36 - go to our website so I'm gonna do Python
08:41 - manage that py run server and we're
08:48 - gonna open up a new tab and I'm gonna go
08:49 - 127 that's slash 8000 or I'm sorry slash
08:55 - pulls and you can see that all the links
09:00 - are green right if I go back to my
09:02 - stylesheet and turn it into something
09:04 - else so let's go back into sorry style
09:09 - dot CSS is right there I'll bring it
09:11 - here if I change this to like blue save
09:15 - command s go back here refresh you can
09:19 - see that all of this is now blue if
09:21 - you're didn't turn blue clothes out of
09:23 - your server break the server with ctrl C
09:26 - and then try it again and it should be
09:28 - fixed and yep there we go
09:33 - and also make sure to save okay and
09:35 - another way to go to this same link is
09:37 - doing HTP localhost colon 8080 q
09:44 - localhost colon 8080 1 colon 8,000 do
09:50 - the same thing
09:53 - alright so that's essentially how we got
09:56 - that to work bring this guy here now we
10:01 - also can add a background image
10:03 - ok so we'll create a subdirectory for
10:05 - images create an images subdirectory so
10:09 - basically inside of our static and pulls
10:13 - we're gonna create static holes we're
10:17 - gonna create a new directory and we're
10:19 - gonna call it images this is we're gonna
10:22 - put all up all of our images
10:25 - so it should look like this and then you
10:28 - can put whatever image you want right
10:30 - background jiff or so what we'll do is
10:35 - we'll go online and like grab an image
10:37 - so let's get cats right click and then
10:46 - just save the image and you can save it
10:50 - whatever you want you're gonna call it
10:51 - like cat background oh sorry we can't
10:55 - just save it wherever we want I'm gonna
10:57 - save it under my site my site or sorry
11:01 - it pulls static pulls images and I'm
11:04 - gonna save this cat underscore
11:06 - background and it's automatically a JPEG
11:09 - file because I have the format selected
11:11 - like that I'm gonna hit save it saved
11:14 - I'm gonna open up my atom and under
11:18 - images I now have my cat background JPEG
11:21 - so let's go back to this tutorial and
11:26 - it's basically saying to do this add
11:28 - this to your style sheet so I'm gonna
11:31 - add this now I'm gonna save so from
11:37 - images instead of background jiff mine
11:40 - is called cat underscore background JPEG
11:46 - like that so now and it's gonna find
11:50 - basically in our HTML code it's gonna
11:52 - find anywhere we have the body tag it's
11:55 - gonna make its background this cat image
11:59 - okay so if I go to you know our
12:05 - index.html if any of this stuff is in a
12:08 - body tag it'll add that to the
12:11 - background so let's check it out it says
12:15 - and you should see the background loaded
12:17 - in the top left of the screen okay let's
12:19 - give it a try let's see if they're in
12:22 - line and there you go it's there right
12:28 - so pretty cool how it works and what I
12:33 - could also do is I could go to my
12:34 - index.html and like wrap maybe a certain
12:37 - part of it in the body tag so
12:39 - like maybe the part that's in the
12:41 - for-loop right so I can I can go like
12:46 - body tag and I can choose to close the
12:51 - body tag outside of this unordered list
12:55 - I can go body like that okay if I want
13:01 - to and I go back i refresh and the same
13:06 - thing okay so this is essentially like a
13:10 - little bit of how HTML and CSS like talk
13:14 - with each other okay and now let's look
13:19 - at kind of their last notes here so
13:21 - there okay so warning of course the
13:24 - static template tag is not available for
13:26 - use in static files like your style
13:27 - sheet which earned generated by Django
13:30 - so in your CSS file you can't use
13:33 - something like static like that it's not
13:39 - gonna know what that is and you can't do
13:41 - like if-then statements here these are
13:45 - just your static files hence they're not
13:47 - dynamic and can't do like variables and
13:50 - cool stuff right like your index your
13:53 - HTML file can with the which has the
13:56 - Django template exist 'm and in there
14:00 - you should always use relative pat's so
14:03 - here we're not using like slash user
14:07 - slash clever programmer slash github
14:10 - slash my site slash my site or slash
14:16 - pols slash what else is it static slash
14:22 - pull slash images right we're not using
14:25 - the absolute path that's the definition
14:28 - of absolute pet we're using a relative
14:30 - path to it you're satisfied between each
14:35 - other because then you can change static
14:37 - underscore URL so this is again a little
14:38 - bit more advanced I'm gonna I'm gonna
14:40 - skip over this one you can read that if
14:42 - you want and that's essentially how you
14:45 - work with general like static files on
14:49 - Django there you have it folks I hope
