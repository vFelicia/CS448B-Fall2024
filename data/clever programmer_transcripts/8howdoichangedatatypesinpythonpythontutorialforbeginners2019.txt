00:00 - - Hey, what's up you guys,
00:02 - Aaron here from Clever Programmer,
00:03 - and today, we're just gonna
be going over casting.
00:06 - You don't know what that means yet,
00:07 - but I'll explain it in a minute.
00:08 - Let's get started.
00:09 - (spooky music)
00:15 - Okay, so, last video I believe
we talked about data types.
00:19 - Now, all casting means,
00:20 - is we are going to be casting
00:22 - from one data type, to another data type.
00:24 - So let's say we had a integer, had one,
00:27 - and we wanted to cast it to
a floating point number, 1.0.
00:31 - You could do that just
by throwing it into this
00:32 - little casting function thing,
00:33 - it will actually turn the integer
00:35 - into a floating point number.
00:36 - So, let's see how that works.
00:38 - So let's say you have a one,
00:42 - x is one,
00:43 - and then I wanna make x a floating point.
00:45 - So we could just put
00:47 - I believe float,
00:49 - it's a function, it looks like a function,
00:50 - oh it's called casting though.
00:51 - And then you can just put
x in there to get 1.0 out.
00:55 - Or you could even just put
one in here, same deal.
00:58 - The same thing happens, okay?
01:01 - So that's basically
what casting looks like.
01:06 - You can pretty much cast any data type
01:07 - to any other data type that makes sense,
01:09 - so for the primitive data types,
01:11 - you can also cast integers to strings,
01:13 - so let's try this.
01:14 - If we have an integer, just one,
01:16 - if you want to cast this to a string,
01:19 - you just put str like that,
you put a number inside,
01:22 - and then when it prints,
01:22 - it's actually a string.
01:23 - You can see the quotation marks here.
01:26 - Same deal if you wanna cast from
01:28 - a string or you pass
it to the int function,
01:31 - but if you wanna cast a string,
01:32 - let's say, just string
with a bunch of gs there,
01:35 - we can cast it to...
01:37 - Actually, what am I saying, stupid me?
01:39 - If you want to cast,
01:40 - so that you wouldn't be
able to cast to an int,
01:42 - because the computer
would actually be like,
01:44 - "What the heck are you trying to do,
01:45 - "cast that to an int."
01:46 - So, if I run this, you get an error.
01:48 - So that's actually good
I made that mistake
01:49 - as a little example for you guys,
01:50 - but if you actually put a
number in here, like 34,
01:55 - and then hit enter
01:57 - to cast it,
01:58 - then you can see that
python actually knows
01:59 - what to do with the string,
02:00 - and actually follows through
with casting it to an int.
02:03 - So, casting is kind of this weird thing,
02:06 - it doesn't work all the time,
02:07 - but you need it to change
between data types.
02:17 - Like, if you want to display a number,
02:18 - so actually what's happening,
02:19 - one good example is,
02:20 - in this print function,
02:21 - you can only print strings to the screen,
02:23 - you can't actually print numbers.
02:25 - So when I put a number in here, five,
02:27 - what's going on in the print function
02:28 - is it is actually being
casted to a string five,
02:31 - the number five is being
casted to the string five
02:33 - before it's actually being printed.
02:35 - And that's why this
five pops up here, okay?
02:38 - Also, booleans you can kind of cast that,
02:42 - it's not very common so
you don't really need it,
02:44 - but it's also a thing you can do.
02:45 - I believe if you cast an int...
02:47 - If you cast an int to a boolean,
02:50 - I think zero is false, and
anything that's not zero,
02:52 - so one, negative one, and
every other possible number
02:56 - are all true, okay?
02:58 - So that's pretty much casting.
02:59 - It's for casting between
data types in python
03:02 - and pretty much every
programming language.
03:04 - But that's how you do it in python,
03:05 - thanks for watching you guys,
03:06 - it's a short video today,
03:07 - and I'll see you next time.
