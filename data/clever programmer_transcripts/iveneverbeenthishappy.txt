00:00 - coding is hard becoming a developer is
00:03 - hard
00:06 - the only question is are you gonna quit
00:11 - or are you gonna keep going
00:15 - it's really as simple as that let's go
00:20 - [Music]
00:23 - what's up guys what are you doing what's
00:26 - up man
00:27 - is that a spiderman man yeah it's thor
00:30 - what are we doing here anyways
00:32 - yo so this is the craziest thing because
00:34 - we just did
00:35 - a launch for profit with javascript and
00:37 - up until
00:38 - then the team was working relentlessly
00:40 - you guys have seen probably from july
00:41 - 4th we've been producing
00:43 - a video like almost every single day
00:45 - going live for three to four hours at a
00:47 - time
00:47 - and we just opened the doors to profit
00:49 - with javascript in about 10 days or nine
00:51 - days from now
00:52 - we're actually going to be closing the
00:53 - doors to proper javascript but like we
00:55 - put in so much effort
00:57 - and then we got over 200 students that
00:59 - enroll in the program just a few days
01:01 - ago
01:02 - which was massive so the program was a
01:05 - massive success
01:06 - and we're so excited for the students to
01:08 - like really change their lives in it
01:10 - so we wanted to just take a little bit
01:11 - of a break and we came to like arrowhead
01:13 - with the entire
01:15 - [Music]
01:25 - it's team 170k for this project
01:42 - [Music]
01:44 - also we wanted to avoid the forest fires
01:46 - california is on fire right now it's
01:48 - insane
01:49 - it's on fire just like clever
01:52 - programmers
01:54 - we're literally we're like the loudest
01:55 - people every time we go to a restaurant
01:56 - we're like the loudest people are like
01:59 - projection that's good though so should
02:02 - we
02:02 - that's what i should do we came here to
02:04 - just celebrate have a vacation for the
02:06 - team relax a little bit i mean we're
02:07 - still putting in crazy amount of work

02:31 - can't sit around like do nothing man
02:33 - it's like impossible give me five
02:34 - minutes i'll do nothing but that's it
02:35 - yeah we go something crazy right yeah
02:37 - even when we were sitting out yesterday
02:39 - i'm like just chilling but then i'm
02:40 - actually like
02:41 - working but like it's relaxing for me to
02:44 - be honest
02:44 - just the change of scenery is like
02:47 - everything changes
02:48 - everything so yeah that's pretty much
02:50 - what we're doing enjoy the rest of the
02:51 - vlog
02:52 - college i feel like people really
02:54 - resonate with it
02:56 - that's what we're writing today's email
02:58 - on like that college is actually like
03:01 - oh yeah a lot of work is up there a lot
03:02 - of that that's our audience
03:04 - right you know yeah what was that that
03:06 - was something yo
03:07 - look at this yeah so somebody goes hey
03:09 - anyone here took the course and can
03:11 - offer your input
03:11 - 600 is a lot then html programmer comes
03:14 - in you go 600 is not a lot are you poor
03:17 - then this guy goes that's a lot go to
03:18 - udemy and pay 10. html programmer comes
03:21 - and he goes i earn 60 000 per year udemy
03:23 - is like buying a toyota and gluing on a
03:25 - bugatti emblem
03:27 - oh it's hilarious he said it you know
03:31 - i love how they're just they're just
03:32 - they're like supporting us like
03:34 - it's like that's like a call bro i love
03:36 - it i mean they're supporting this
03:38 - because it's just like
03:38 - so much value just provided up for free
03:41 - you know so
03:42 - i think it just makes sense yeah
03:46 - and the people who are gonna hate
03:47 - they're just gonna hate you can't really
03:49 - do anything about it
03:50 - they just behave haters behaved
03:54 - i mean haters be hating yo so many
03:57 - people like
03:58 - like talk about you to me you know what
03:59 - i mean like yeah everybody talks about
04:01 - you to me
04:02 - look it doesn't suck there's nothing
04:04 - wrong with you there's a lot of great
04:06 - content a lot of people will teach
04:07 - great content i mean it's just like what
04:09 - we have is not comparable right we have
04:11 - the community we have the coaching calls
04:13 - it doesn't compare to a udemy course
04:15 - that costs ten dollars yeah it's as
04:16 - simple as that
04:17 - because it's almost it's impossible for
04:19 - them to economically provide
04:21 - all those things yeah like they can't
04:22 - hire full-time developers or people to
04:24 - actually provide them like i was talking
04:25 - to this ps student yesterday a guy that
04:27 - wanted to buy and he's like oh i bought
04:28 - this udemy course on react
04:30 - and he was like it's cool but like i
04:32 - barely started coding
04:33 - and how that course made me feel was
04:35 - like i had to go for a
04:36 - whole long year but seeing your guys's
04:39 - projects made me feel like i can code in
04:41 - like
04:41 - three months because you're building
04:43 - he's like i was building a
04:45 - hamburger builder that's my like final
04:48 - project on that course
04:49 - i was like i was it was funny instead of
04:51 - like an amazon clone you know
04:53 - a hamburger wait i actually took that
04:56 - exact course
05:00 - the hamburger the hamburger uh [ __ ]
05:02 - what's it called builders
05:04 - yeah i have a good builder project you
05:06 - know why i took that course
05:07 - because i got a client yeah i got a
05:09 - client uh for a react job
05:11 - right and i told him i don't know any
05:13 - react they're like okay that's fine
05:14 - that's fine
05:15 - i got the job for react and literally
05:17 - like a day before starting
05:19 - i took that course tried to try like
05:21 - build up some knowledge yeah and that
05:22 - was
05:26 - and imagine if you took that job and you
05:28 - had this reaction content
05:29 - yeah that's the thing nobody's dropping
05:32 - this react content
05:35 - he's got him confused was like how
05:46 - right after all of our tutorials and
05:47 - start dropping on react
05:49 - so he made like a to-do list or
05:51 - something like that again or react yeah
05:54 - he already had it on javascript vanilla
05:56 - and then he made it
05:57 - yeah i mean he makes good contact drop a
06:00 - value bomb
06:02 - time yeah netflix yeah netflix right
06:04 - we're gonna build netflix we're gonna
06:05 - take the whole
06:06 - day to build out the netflix project
06:07 - we're gonna whiteboard everything and
06:09 - [ __ ] like that
06:10 - we should do more of we should do stuff
06:12 - like that because look even if it gets
06:13 - small views
06:14 - it's fine but like it's like it's people
06:16 - really care and they get a lot of value
06:18 - even if it's like five thousand people
06:20 - that watch it's like blows their mind
06:21 - you can build something you know how you
06:22 - you were building a sunny like a really
06:24 - helpful thing for ps like that's kind of
06:26 - the tool that really helped you out
06:28 - yeah like even though building something
06:29 - like that and showing how to build like
06:31 - that probably like a dashboard view
06:33 - dashboard until you build this oh
06:34 - cp uh yeah cpu reaction [ __ ] like that
06:37 - [ __ ] like that right we can build some
06:38 - [ __ ] like that as well like take a day
06:39 - like
06:40 - and we could actually just even go
06:41 - twitch live stream it and then they can
06:43 - be documenting the experience you know
06:45 - and then we can
06:45 - the whole the whole day or one or two
06:48 - days we can spend on building the
06:49 - project
06:50 - so it's like vlog slash we're building
