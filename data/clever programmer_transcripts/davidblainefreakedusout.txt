00:11 - this [ __ ] is
00:12 - [ __ ] nuts fsl david blaine there's
00:15 - about 14
00:16 - 000 plus feet in the air right now i
00:18 - forgot emily told me
00:20 - yeah i would have been watching i woke
00:21 - up at 5 55 a.m i got one to pick up
00:37 - and the problem is since he's only going
00:39 - up it only gets worse and worse and
00:42 - colder
01:15 - [Applause]
01:18 - holy [ __ ]
01:27 - [Music]
01:38 - oh
01:45 - [Music]
01:53 - guys we just got done with a pretty epic
01:55 - day i mean we're going to be going back
01:57 - and continuing
01:57 - our learning and growing it's about 3 30
02:00 - p.m jonathan just gave me a good idea to
02:02 - give advice to beginner programmers
02:04 - and i'm going to go ahead and do that so
02:07 - if you
02:08 - are a beginner programmer one of the
02:11 - most important things i can tell you is
02:13 - that
02:13 - you have these feelings of feeling
02:15 - frustrated with programming
02:17 - like you don't get it um like you're
02:20 - maybe not smart enough to be able to get
02:22 - it or that you might not
02:24 - ever actually get a job or make an
02:26 - income with it so
02:27 - maybe you might even want to stop
02:31 - what i will say to you is
02:34 - guys it never stops feeling like that
02:37 - that feeling of you thinking you're not
02:40 - good when it comes to coding and
02:42 - programming
02:42 - it never ever goes away
02:45 - and um you know communities
02:49 - like stack overflow and whatnot you know
02:51 - it's good in its own way
02:53 - but they make sure of that because even
02:55 - when you post questions there
02:57 - a lot of the people in the community
02:59 - kind of make you feel like you're not
03:00 - good enough or you're not smart enough
03:02 - so
03:03 - you might feel those things happen to
03:06 - you
03:06 - but so many of you don't know that
03:10 - you're so
03:11 - close to getting that internship you're
03:14 - so close to getting a junior level
03:15 - developer job
03:17 - where somebody is looking for your
03:20 - heart and your willingness to learn
03:22 - coding rather than
03:23 - even how damn good you are right now
03:26 - because they're thinking
03:28 - man if i can pick this person up and
03:30 - they want to learn
03:31 - they're hungry we can give them guidance
03:33 - and make them
03:34 - good mostly the problem that a lot of
03:37 - you have
03:38 - is you're learning but maybe that's all
03:41 - you're doing
03:42 - so you feel like you're not really
03:43 - making any forward progress whereas if
03:46 - you were at a company
03:47 - all the learning you would be doing
03:49 - would be towards building something and
03:51 - the developers there would be teaching
03:53 - you how to do that
03:54 - one thing i can tell you though might
03:57 - help a little bit is that on our youtube
03:59 - channel we are
04:00 - building projects every single day real
04:03 - world projects
04:04 - as long as you can build those types of
04:06 - projects and put them on your portfolio
04:08 - that gives you something
04:09 - tangible that you can show to a
04:11 - potential employer
04:14 - all people who have never looked at
04:16 - technology have been able to pick up
04:18 - programming and learn coding
04:19 - it's all about not really allowing that
04:21 - thought in your head and just sitting
04:23 - down and getting to work starting to put
04:25 - in the work starting to see
04:26 - and be fascinated by what you can do
04:29 - with it and learning it in the right way
04:31 - so
04:31 - message you is please don't quit keep
04:34 - going
04:35 - be curious ask questions learn
04:37 - programming is a beautiful beautiful
04:39 - thing
04:41 - thank you so much for joining the five

05:46 - pumped and excited to have you in here
05:48 - click that button below join the group
05:50 - share this with your friends and i'll
05:52 - see you inside
05:53 - peace this is literally one of my
05:56 - favorite things on the planet that i've
05:57 - purchased
05:58 - they said money can't buy you happiness
06:01 - you [ __ ] bought her bro i bought my
06:04 - happiness
06:19 - it's programming is literally like
06:21 - having a genie
06:23 - but instead of having three wishes you
06:24 - have unlimited wishes
06:26 - but the only thing is you have to learn
06:28 - how to speak to the [ __ ] genie
06:30 - that's the only thing if you can put in
06:33 - the
06:34 - time to work to learn how to speak with
06:35 - the gene then you can create anything
06:38 - think of mark zuckerberg right he
06:41 - created facebook every time you log into
06:43 - facebook
06:44 - you are literally entering the brain
06:47 - of mark zuckerberg every time you log in
06:50 - every time you log into amazon and use
06:52 - it you are entering a universe that
06:54 - jeff bezos at some point created
06:58 - so that to me is really fascinating
07:02 - that to me is really powerful because
07:04 - even if somebody who's a painter
07:07 - you can only experience experience that
07:09 - painting by looking at it
07:11 - if you are somebody who does video you
07:13 - can only experience their video by
07:14 - viewing it just like you guys are
07:15 - viewing this right now
07:17 - but if you can build a project or an app
07:20 - people have to get inside of that and
07:22 - they get to experience
07:25 - what you have created nothing else has
07:28 - that same experience
07:30 - that programming allows you to do to be
07:32 - able to make an app that people
07:33 - actually get inside of where they're
07:35 - inside of your brain and they're
07:36 - experiencing
07:38 - that's to me that's like art
07:41 - but alive all right guys i hope you
07:44 - enjoyed
07:45 - today's vlog again it's something brand
07:48 - new that we're doing
07:49 - and we are reading all of your guys's
07:51 - comments so i know it's zacky tallip
07:53 - you left an awesome comment on the
07:55 - two-minute vlog that we did yesterday
07:58 - and you know you were like him this is
08:00 - so inspiring
08:02 - blah blah blah so if this is helpful to
08:04 - you guys do let us know
08:05 - we read it and we care and that tells us
08:08 - should we put out more content like this
08:10 - or not and
08:12 - my message to you guys is one of just
08:15 - like
08:15 - positivity and love like we're in this
08:18 - community we're together
08:19 - and let's make sure that we make this
08:22 - family feeling with clever programmer
08:24 - right we keep it strong
08:25 - keep it growing just remember who you
08:27 - are
08:28 - as a person and keep your focus keep
08:31 - coding like just don't
08:33 - quit because you never know where it can
08:36 - lead you right for me
08:37 - coding played in really weird ways
08:41 - and i didn't really know what i was
08:42 - going to do but now it gave
08:44 - me an amazing life and it allows me to
08:48 - have
08:48 - a lot of people on the team and then
08:50 - grow clever programmers so i had a very
08:53 - crazy journey but i'm really happy with
08:56 - where i'm at right now and i can't
08:57 - imagine
08:58 - where i'm gonna be going but it's not a
09:00 - race
09:01 - everybody's on a different pace so just
09:03 - be patient
09:04 - and just put in the work when it comes
09:07 - to programming and coding
09:08 - trust me it's worth it it's worth it to
09:10 - put in that [ __ ] hard work
09:12 - and do it because most people can't so
09:14 - if somebody who has no experience where
09:16 - they can pick it up and learn and start
09:17 - doing things and have fun
09:19 - you can too with that said i love your
09:21 - beautiful face
09:22 - this is qazi and as always i'll see you
