00:00 - fourteen billion nine hundred ninety
00:01 - nine million nine hundred ninety nine
00:02 - thousand nine hundred and ninety nine
00:04 - rust bucks and ninety nine rush cents
00:05 - code like the wind my lady okay that was
00:09 - not that funny
00:10 - i mean i don't really get it but ah
00:12 - let's get going
00:13 - yo what's up guys i was inspired and i
00:15 - thought how about if i make a video and
00:17 - in today's video
00:18 - we're actually going to be reacting to a
00:21 - scene from silicon valley where
00:23 - algel foil guilfoyle actually debugs
00:26 - code so we're going to jump into it
00:27 - let's see how it is i want you to go
00:29 - ahead smash that like button but right
00:31 - before we get into this video
00:32 - subscribe to the channel because this is
00:34 - the channel where you're going to be
00:35 - learning
00:36 - all things full stack development this
00:38 - is your boy and this is a
00:39 - developer react series let's get
00:42 - straight into it
00:44 - [Music]
00:51 - oh
00:54 - [Music]
00:55 - okay so apparently they're a bunch of
00:57 - developers they're working overnight
01:00 - they're sleeping here
01:01 - um and you know there's somewhat truth
01:03 - to this because as
01:05 - developers you kind of do crazy
01:06 - sometimes and
01:08 - it does feel like that where you're
01:09 - coding for so long that you ended up
01:11 - sleeping
01:12 - but realistically at your actual job
01:14 - that's not what you're gonna see okay
01:16 - bunch of people sleeping that's not
01:17 - really real but
01:18 - okay it's funny let's keep going
01:22 - my merry knights of piper sir owen doing
01:26 - valiant battle with the authentication
01:27 - service
01:28 - yes good yeah oh and prithee
01:31 - becky my queen i'll go with
01:35 - cashless payments russ's pricing keeps
01:37 - tripping us up
01:38 - okay how so well this morning he decided
01:40 - everyone at russ fest should be a
01:42 - billionaire
01:43 - so every dollar someone puts into their
01:44 - account will now be worth one billion
01:46 - rust bucks
01:47 - zwoons so what like a sandwich will be
01:51 - worth
01:52 - 15 billion rest bucks or something 14
01:54 - billion 999 million 999
01:57 - 999 rust bucks and 99 rush cents
02:00 - because he thought that would sound
02:01 - cheaper it's kind of screwing up the
02:03 - interface
02:04 - but the whole etnt deal is writing on
02:06 - this right
02:07 - we'll get there good okay excellent
02:10 - well uh code like the wind my lady
02:14 - okay that was not that funny i mean i
02:17 - don't really get it but
02:18 - ah let's get going oh good friar gabriel
02:21 - how does thou
02:22 - fare with the ticketing module
02:26 - it's gone what do you mean gone
02:30 - for some reason guilfoyle deleted the
02:32 - whole thing a few minutes ago what
02:34 - yeah okay that's really scary if you
02:36 - find out a developer just deleted
02:38 - something
02:38 - and you work with them or you were also
02:40 - working on that software and you walk in
02:42 - and they're just deleted the entire
02:44 - freaking repo
02:45 - or the code base is gone that's
02:47 - something to be stressed about foil yes
02:50 - richard i'm aware the drone dispatching
02:52 - code has been deleted and i'm working
02:53 - very hard to restore the right version
02:55 - whoa
02:56 - i love how deadpan he is you just told
02:58 - me that the ticketing module got deleted
03:00 - ticketing too so let's see what's going
03:02 - on so what it looks like
03:04 - is on the screens he has um
03:07 - so here i actually see he has the
03:09 - command line open
03:10 - uh on the left hand side it also looks
03:13 - like he has sublime text open
03:15 - on the right computer and there's like
03:17 - three sublime texts open i don't know
03:19 - why you would do that you would normally
03:20 - just have
03:21 - all the tabs open in one you know that
03:24 - gives it away
03:25 - you know i don't know just like a real
03:26 - developer situation going on because
03:28 - real developer
03:29 - i don't know that's i mean they get
03:30 - messy but uh most of the times that's
03:32 - not how you would do it but you know
03:34 - every developer is different
03:36 - and most developers just have their own
03:38 - setups and their own likings
03:40 -  that's problematic i'll get on that
03:42 - next what the is going on
03:45 - based on the amount of work left to do
03:47 - and the number of hours left before the
03:48 - festival i decided to task son of anton
03:50 - to use machine learning to debug some of
03:52 - our code
03:55 - okay that's so debugging is already a
03:59 - nightmare it's one of the hardest things
04:00 - you can do in coding to take that one
04:03 - step further
04:04 - and have to debug um
04:08 - write a machine learning algorithm that
04:10 - debugs that's essentially machine
04:12 - trying to debug your code good luck
04:15 - you're gonna have a lot of trouble
04:16 - figuring out what went wrong can wear
04:18 - you kidding me you gave your ai
04:21 - permission
04:21 - to overwrite code in the internal file
04:23 - system were you gonna tell me about this
04:25 - no i thought that was the company policy
04:29 - these days
04:29 - okay so another thing to get out of this
04:32 - he makes the code changes
04:34 - and he doesn't even actually inform
04:35 - anybody now something important as a
04:37 - developer you're going to be working on
04:39 - a team with people
04:40 - one of the worst things that so many
04:41 - developers tend to do
04:43 - is they lack communication and that
04:45 - makes them a developer like guilfoyle
04:46 - where they're really good at what they
04:48 - do
04:48 - and they have three freaking sublime
04:50 - texts open
04:51 - but nobody freaking likes working with
04:54 - them so what happens when you do that
04:56 - well whenever somebody gets a chance
04:58 - they're gonna try to fire you
05:00 - you get in a really bad situation so
05:02 - you'd rather be a developer that's not
05:04 - the best but you have
05:05 - excellent communication skills and
05:07 - teamworking skills because at the end of
05:09 - the day if you're going to build
05:10 - anything great
05:11 - you got to do it with the team well your
05:13 - ai
05:14 - just failed epically that's unclear
05:18 - it's possible that son of anton decided
05:20 - that the most efficient way to get rid
05:21 - of all the bugs
05:22 - was to get rid of all the software which
05:24 - is technically and
05:26 - statistically correct but artificial
05:28 - neural nets are sort of a black box so
05:30 - will
05:30 - artificial neural nets are a actual
05:32 - black box
05:33 - never know for sure so
05:36 - now we get into this situation and this
05:39 - is super interesting to talk about
05:41 - if you have a developer that does
05:42 - something like this where they think
05:44 - that they're intellectually superior
05:46 - than everybody else which is pretty much
05:47 - all a stack overflow
05:49 - but if you have a developer that kind of
05:50 - thinks like this you
05:52 - are in a really difficult situation
05:54 - because they're going to get defensive
05:56 - when you try to talk to them about
05:57 - something
05:58 - they feel like their software is their
05:59 - own and if and because they spend so
06:01 - much time writing that code and working
06:03 - with that software
06:04 - if you're saying the software is bad
06:07 - they really think you're saying
06:08 - they are bad as human beings and so
06:11 - separating the two is very difficult now
06:13 - one thing he could have done when he was
06:15 - talking to guilfoyle is
06:16 - made him less defensive and instead of
06:19 - talking to him in such a harsh way and
06:20 - going could you believe that your code
06:22 - did this and i can't believe you did
06:24 - that
06:24 - you could be like hey you're an
06:25 - excellent developer you crush it at this
06:27 - job you're fantastic
06:30 - but just this one thing that happened i
06:32 - think this might be causing problems
06:34 - that would have made guilfoyle a lot
06:36 - less defensive and open up more
06:38 - so this is a tip for if you're working
06:39 - on a software development team and you
06:41 - have a colleague
06:41 - that's how you should approach it and
06:43 - that's how you should speak with them
06:44 - did you
06:45 - order meet like a bunch of meat
06:48 - like 4 000 pounds of meat
06:53 - interesting i put son of anton on
06:56 - finding us cheap hamburgers for lunch
06:58 - it looks like the reward function was a
07:01 - little underspecified
07:02 - okay that's hilarious so basically what
07:04 - happened is basically he's writing this
07:06 - machine
07:07 - learning algorithm and i like how he has
07:09 - like github octa-cat on the left-hand
07:11 - side what's funny that's happening here
07:13 - he has a machine learning algorithm and
07:15 - now machine learning
07:16 - algorithm is designed to you know where
07:19 - things get more rewarded does more of
07:21 - those things when you get less rewards
07:22 - for something
07:23 - it does less of those things that's how
07:25 - artificial intelligence
07:26 - works okay so if you taught artificial
07:29 - intelligence machine
07:30 - hey you get rewarded for surviving
07:32 - longer and you get not rewarded for
07:34 - dying off earlier
07:35 - it'll try to survive longer okay or
07:37 - it'll try to eat more food or attack
07:39 - more people whatever you teach it to do
07:41 - so scary he made this uh
07:44 - algorithm this algorithm got out of
07:46 - control
07:47 - and it started report being rewarded
07:49 - really highly for ordering food
07:52 - so it went and like ordered freaking 4
07:54 - 000 or 10
07:55 - 000 pounds of meat instead of just a
07:57 - little bit of meat reward function was a
07:59 - little underspecified
08:00 - okay that's why he said the reward
08:02 - function was a little underspecified
08:04 - which is a good
08:05 - idea for you to write unit tests for
08:08 - your code before you do them but a lot
08:10 - of developers that think they're better
08:11 - than everybody else sometimes will not
08:12 - write unit tests
08:14 - and do things directly which causes
08:16 - problems so
08:17 - one tell that you're a senior developer
08:19 - and you're excellent at your job
08:20 - they do tons of testing senior
08:22 - developers do so much freaking testing
08:24 - it's crazy before this
08:26 - put things into production so don't put
08:28 - things into production
08:30 - before testing now on son of anton is
08:32 - banned
08:33 - just write code like a normal human
08:35 -  being please
08:37 - hey guilfoyle so i've been thinking
08:38 - about your ai and its
08:40 - many deficits i think son of anton's
08:43 - issue might be how it's handling reward
08:44 - uncertainty
08:45 - your issue man right that's the problem
08:47 - it's handling reward uncertainty in a
08:49 - poor way and so it's
08:51 - going crazy but again guilfoyle is
08:53 - getting defensive again
08:55 - the insecurity masked by false bravado
08:58 - and
08:58 - unisex cologne off it's not unisex
09:06 - oh man okay well that's all i had for
09:10 - you today guys
09:11 - you know if you want to become a
09:12 - developer and you want to learn more
09:14 - about this or if you enjoyed this video
09:16 - let me know this was the first of many
09:18 - developer react series i hope you
09:21 - enjoyed me reacting to silicon valley i
09:22 - hope it was entertaining
09:24 - you'll learn something and hopefully
09:25 - you're not going to order 10 000 pounds
09:27 - of meat with that said i love your
09:29 - beautiful face
09:30 - this is your boy kazzy and i'll see you
09:32 - in the next
09:34 - video
09:39 - [Music]
