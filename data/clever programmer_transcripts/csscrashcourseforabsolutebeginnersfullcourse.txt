00:00 - welcome to the CSS flexbox crash course
00:03 - how you make images fit into a flexbox
00:07 - how do you add multiple cats in a row
00:10 - and then when you keep hitting the cat
00:12 - generator button it actually puts the
00:14 - cats
00:14 - where you want them and it doesn't
00:16 - actually go out of the box and those
00:17 - images come into the right place how do
00:20 - you put your age and days or a button
00:22 - like click me and a button like delete
00:24 - and then they fit into the right places
00:27 - right grids and nothing kind of spills
00:31 - over or kind of gets messed up this is
00:35 - your instructor Rafa Kazi from clever
00:37 - programmer comm and this is Aaron also
00:39 - from clever programmer comm and what are
00:41 - we gonna be teaching them a lot of cool
00:43 - stuff CSS flexbox some of the theory
00:45 - about it at first is to go over it but
00:48 - then a couple cool projects all right
00:51 - what else we have planned that's about
00:53 - right so we're gonna go through the
00:54 - theory in the start and make sure you
00:56 - get the theory down and then we're gonna
01:00 - actually build some projects to some
01:01 - mini projects and we're going to be
01:04 - building those later into the video so
01:07 - for now let's jump into the meat and
01:09 - potatoes I have put together an
01:12 - incredible mind-blowing three-part
01:16 - master class that will show you
01:18 - step-by-step exactly what you need to do
01:21 - what the opportunity in your life as a
01:24 - Python developer can look like what your
01:27 - earning potential can look like and what
01:29 - are the exact steps you need to take to
01:32 - make this happen in your life please
01:34 - keep in mind this training I've put
01:36 - together for you is absolutely free of
01:39 - charge completely free all I'm gonna
01:42 - need from you is your name and your
01:44 - email address and once you pop that in
01:47 - I'm gonna send this training over to you
01:50 - right away with that said the link is
01:53 - gonna be in the video below in the
01:55 - description so go ahead and click that
01:56 - link I'll also try to put it here on the
02:00 - screen in the video thank you so much
02:03 - for watching as always I love your face
02:05 - and I'll see you
02:06 - in the next video hey you welcome back
02:18 - now what I want to talk about in this
02:20 - video is what the heck is CSS and give
02:24 - you intuitive I always have trouble
02:26 - saying that word understanding of how it
02:30 - works and what it actually does okay so
02:32 - CSS stands for cascading style sheet
02:36 - fancy word I never use it but it all it
02:41 - means is giving your website some design
02:44 - design some pizazz okay so it's like
02:47 - imagine if you are going out to a fancy
02:50 - dinner
02:51 - you can go completely naked that's one
02:54 - way and the second way that you can go
02:57 - is actually dress up in really fancy
03:00 - clothing okay and designing your website
03:05 - or not designing your website using CSS
03:08 - and just having HTML it's kind of like
03:10 - being naked in today's day and age okay
03:14 - it's inappropriate it's not acceptable
03:18 - you'll be judged and your value on the
03:22 - social ladder will be lowered and you
03:26 - don't want that when it comes to your
03:28 - website because that's what will happen
03:30 - online right people who come to your
03:32 - website they won't find you credible
03:34 - they might not hire you as a Python
03:36 - developer and it could be embarrassing
03:40 - it could be shameful and your time will
03:43 - be wasted so you definitely need
03:46 - absolutely need to learn this and know
03:49 - what's the heck this is cool with that
03:53 - said let me give you an example so here
03:56 - is the website with CSS sort of what I
04:00 - just showed you and what it looks like
04:02 - and it looks beautiful the form is
04:03 - beautiful when you click it it goes
04:05 - beautiful blue when you hover over you
04:07 - know gives it a little thing and you
04:08 - hover over you know so it's nice here is
04:12 - the same website without any CSS okay so
04:16 - notice the navigation bar and
04:18 - what happened to that and notice how
04:22 - nothing is centered notice how it's kind
04:27 - of weird and notice that this button
04:33 - when you hover over nothing happens and
04:36 - all of this kind of looks pretty ugly
04:38 - right and like and and check it out it
04:41 - runs from left to right forever pretty
04:45 - hard on your eyes and this is the case
04:49 - for many other websites right have you
04:51 - ever had that happen where you go to
04:52 - youtube.com or facebook.com and you see
04:56 - it like in this format kind of right
04:59 - that has happened to me a few times and
05:00 - why that happens actually is because it
05:04 - hasn't loaded its CSS file and so it'll
05:10 - happen and then when you refresh boom it
05:13 - looks like normal Facebook again or it
05:15 - looks like normal Google again okay and
05:21 - now I want to give you you know now I've
05:24 - give you an example let's just show you
05:27 - how it actually works okay so I like to
05:30 - just open code pen because it's kind of
05:32 - just chill and you can follow along
05:33 - really easily or you can just follow
05:35 - along in your local text editor doesn't
05:37 - matter if you want to know how I put my
05:39 - stuff to the left-hand side I click
05:41 - Change View and I do this left one okay
05:45 - I like that one a lot so let's just take
05:48 - a H let's just take h1 tag right and
05:51 - let's say hello hi there now I can do a
05:57 - few things with this h1 tag I can style
06:03 - it and make it look you know change the
06:06 - color of it for example okay so right
06:07 - now it says hello hi there so I'm gonna
06:11 - change it to another color I'm gonna
06:13 - change it to let's say green so what I
06:17 - can do is inside of this h1 tag I can
06:20 - actually pass in the style attribute and
06:23 - I can say color colon green semicolon
06:28 - save and you can see that the color
06:31 - turned
06:32 - Green okay so this is one way of styling
06:36 - my code and this is essentially writing
06:40 - CSS inside of my HTML code okay another
06:47 - way I could do this is in my HTML I
06:54 - could have a style tag like this and
06:58 - inside of this style tag I can say that
07:03 - my h1 right and why I want to show you
07:09 - this way is because like imagine if I
07:12 - had multiple h1 and let's say I wanted
07:21 - them all to be green well what I would
07:23 - have to do is I would have to add in a
07:24 - style attribute and color green and
07:27 - style attribute and color green and
07:28 - everywhere on my website I had h1 tag I
07:32 - would have to repeat that process over
07:34 - and over again now a cool a better way
07:36 - to deal with this is to say style of the
07:40 - top style tag and then in there actually
07:43 - say that for the h1 tag I want to just
07:48 - color it green like this ok and notice
07:52 - every h1 tag got colored green now
07:57 - there's some important terminology here
08:00 - that I'm going to say now for the first
08:04 - time and what I want you to do is write
08:07 - it down or type it in somewhere and
08:10 - remember it because this is important
08:12 - okay so this is a tag right this h1 that
08:19 - I wrote here this is called a selector
08:22 - so what I'm doing is I'm selecting all
08:25 - the h1 tags now what if I wanted to
08:29 - select h2 tags I would change this to h2
08:34 - ok this is just a declaration code block
08:39 - so whatever goes in between these
08:42 - squigglies that doesn't really matter
08:44 - and I can I can do more
08:46 - things as well like for example I can
08:48 - change the font weight okay
08:53 - I can change the font size okay so let's
09:00 - try something you know crazy and let's
09:04 - see if it does anything cool it changed
09:07 - the size so all h1 tags from now on are
09:11 - going to be 70 pixels okay if I want to
09:15 - make this color black I can make it
09:17 - black if I want to make it yellow I can
09:21 - do that too maybe you want to give it
09:27 - like some kind of hex code right so I
09:30 - have this Chrome extension that allows
09:33 - me to pick any color I want so let's say
09:35 - I want some color from this page I'm
09:37 - gonna click here I'm gonna click on that
09:39 - color picker and I'm gonna say pick
09:42 - color from page and I'll just let's say
09:46 - pick some random color let's just say I
09:49 - want to pick this white color or let's
09:55 - see if I can yeah let's actually pick
09:56 - this gray color it's a cool color did it
10:02 - pick it did it pick it oh it's not
10:05 - picking it okay let's try this gray one
10:07 - right here okay so it picked the
10:09 - background of this right and it copied
10:13 - it so what I can do is in color I'll
10:15 - just paste that and now you can see that
10:19 - it's the same gray that's in that inside
10:21 - that HTML CSS box that's now here okay
10:27 - so I'm grabbing that selector now I can
10:32 - go further and I can get different kinds
10:35 - of selectors as well okay five for
10:38 - example create a div and I put this h1
10:42 - you know inside that div or I can call
10:49 - this body as well right so if I have my
10:52 - body tag then what I can do is write in
10:56 - that style I can also say that hey if
10:59 - you're within the
10:59 - then maybe I want to align the text and
11:04 - I want to center align it so there you
11:08 - go so now everything that's in the body
11:10 - will be Center aligned and all each one
11:12 - has the this attribute alright so you
11:16 - can see that that got Center aligned now
11:18 - in this video the point was just to kind
11:21 - of give you a feel for what CSS is and
11:25 - how it works okay at a very basic level
11:28 - now we're gonna get more advanced with
11:31 - it and I'm gonna show you how to create
11:33 - buttons that when you hover over the
11:35 - change colors how to add borders around
11:39 - images how to make your tables look
11:41 - better there's gonna be a lot of things
11:43 - that we're gonna be covering okay so in
11:45 - this video my my I I'm not trying to fry
11:48 - your brain here is just to kind of give
11:51 - you an idea of how it works now one
11:55 - other thing I'm gonna share with you
11:57 - before I end this video is that notice
11:59 - everything that's in the style tag right
12:01 - I could keep it inside the HTML but what
12:04 - if I want to create multiple HTML files
12:07 - well then I would need to paste that
12:10 - style code everywhere over and over
12:12 - again and that'll be redundant so what I
12:14 - would like to do is actually take this
12:17 - code cut it and paste it in the CSS
12:21 - delete the style from there and so HTML
12:26 - then only deals with HTML part and the
12:29 - CSS deals with the CSS part okay so this
12:34 - way your code is nice and segmented and
12:38 - you can easily deal with the logic so
12:41 - your design goes in the CSS file and
12:43 - your rest of your code will go in your
12:47 - HTML file okay so in the upcoming video
12:49 - I'll also show you how to set this up
12:50 - locally how to create a CSS file and
12:53 - Link it to your HTML file and everything
12:56 - and beyond we're gonna do all of that
12:58 - step-by-step that's it for this video
13:00 - thank you so much for watching as always
13:02 - I'll see you in the next video
13:07 - [Applause]
13:09 - [Music]
13:09 - [Applause]
13:10 - [Music]
13:13 - hey you welcome back so in this video
13:17 - we're gonna talk about the setup and how
13:20 - as a developer right if you're working
13:23 - on CSS or you're working on HTML or
13:26 - you're building a front-end project what
13:28 - your workflow looks like but in this I'm
13:30 - gonna just go over it again but it's
13:32 - gonna be like more of a recap so again I
13:36 - got my chrome popped up to my right
13:38 - alright I'm gonna pop open my vs code
13:41 - visual studio you could use whatever
13:44 - text editor you want
13:46 - I just recently discovered Visual Studio
13:50 - code and they recently made it available
13:53 - for Mac and they did some massive
13:55 - updates and it looks beautiful so I just
13:58 - use this now I'm gonna just open a
14:01 - folder so I'll go to HTML crash course
14:04 - and you know I can open up whichever
14:07 - folder I want so I'm just gonna open
14:08 - that one up and let's get out of here
14:12 - and in this one I can create a new
14:15 - folder and start writing some CSS okay
14:18 - so we'll just play around with some CSS
14:20 - and just see how it feels and you'll
14:23 - start to get a hang of it and then I'll
14:24 - even show you that as a developer you're
14:27 - not writing all this code all the time
14:29 - unless you just do front end all the
14:31 - time right you're not writing all a lot
14:34 - of this code from scratch you can
14:36 - actually use stuff from online and other
14:38 - plate other tools you could use and I'm
14:41 - gonna share those with you as well so
14:43 - let's say I create a new file and we'll
14:46 - just call it Kazi dot HTML okay and I
14:53 - will go to my Chrome I will hit command
14:56 - o I will go to github HTML crash course
15:01 - and Kazi that HTML I will open it okay
15:04 - so it's the currently a blank file like
15:06 - I expected I'll hit doc tab autocomplete
15:10 - I will delete that stuff cuz we don't
15:12 - need that for now I will call this
15:17 - new file or new video and I will hit
15:26 - refresh and at the top you can see in
15:28 - the tab so that's that's not CSS right
15:30 - now but I'll show you how to add CSS
15:32 - with it okay so and I'll show you how to
15:35 - link your style sheet as well so now
15:38 - what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
15:39 - create a folder and we're gonna call
15:43 - this folder practice CSS okay and in
15:49 - this folder I will throw Kazi in there
15:51 - okay so I will hit I'll move it in there
15:54 - now inside of this folder I'm going to
15:57 - create another folder and I will call
16:00 - the Styles and inside of the folder
16:03 - Styles I will create a new file and I'll
16:06 - call it styles.css now this is very
16:09 - important how I structured it so pay
16:12 - attention and a lot you know you might
16:16 - make this mistake where you might put
16:21 - styles as CSS kind of outside of that
16:23 - folder or somewhere else so just make
16:25 - sure you're aware of that and what I
16:30 - want to do now is let's say I write some
16:32 - CSS in here right so I'll say hey make
16:35 - all the H ones gonna be color here and I
16:39 - can also do something pretty cool and
16:41 - I'll show you
16:42 - h1 and I can say h1 a and make the color
16:47 - of this let's say red alright so a
16:53 - visual studio again it's pretty cool I
16:55 - can hover over this and click this and
16:58 - like look it shows me that the color of
17:01 - this is red and sometimes what it'll do
17:04 - it is it'll even pop up like color meter
17:08 - and you can just play around with it
17:09 - visually you know like it just brought
17:13 - it up right now I still am figuring out
17:15 - how the heck it actually brings it up
17:17 - but sometimes it brings it up and then
17:19 - you can just control it from there
17:20 - anyway let's go back to our code and
17:23 - Kazi that HTML so in here if I write an
17:28 - h1 right and I say
17:30 - [Music]
17:32 - practice CSS header1
17:38 - this should be this should be green okay
17:41 - so I have to open this file again so I'm
17:43 - gonna because the I change where the
17:46 - file is located so now it's not in this
17:48 - directory any more users clever
17:49 - programmer github HTML crash course
17:52 - slash Kazi now it's in slash practice
17:58 - CSS slash ecology dot HTML okay I can
18:03 - also I could have just went from here
18:05 - HTML crash course clicked on practice
18:08 - CSS and open it from here okay I'm just
18:11 - making you practice with some pads and
18:13 - how they work alright so now we got we
18:18 - got this header over here so let's go to
18:21 - our so now why is it not green right
18:24 - that might be one other questions you
18:25 - might have I hate like hey and styles
18:26 - that CSS you have a green but it's not
18:29 - green well if I actually write it here
18:34 - and SS style equals color green and i
18:42 - refresh you'll notice that it turns
18:45 - green right but I don't have it here I
18:50 - have it in a file and the reason is that
18:51 - that file is not connected to this okay
18:54 - another way I could do this is in the
18:57 - head I could write the style tag that's
19:00 - where actually you would put the style
19:01 - tag and in here I can say make h1 and
19:04 - make the color of this green and now
19:08 - when i refresh it's gonna be green I can
19:10 - say make it red and I can go here and
19:12 - it'll be red ok so let me delete this
19:19 - again
19:23 - but what I would like to do is that keep
19:26 - the style in the Styles that CSS file so
19:29 - I hit command B to hide the toolbar on
19:31 - the left hand side so now when I connect
19:34 - the stylesheet to my HTML how do I do
19:36 - that I just go inside of my head
19:38 - I do style hit tab or sorry go here hit
19:42 - link hit tab and yes it's a style sheet
19:47 - so I'm gonna leave it as is and for the
19:49 - link I'm gonna provide a local link so
19:51 - how do the paths work well currently
19:54 - right I'm inside of kazi HTML so this is
19:59 - a file so I'm gonna go to styles and
20:01 - then inside of styles I want to go to
20:03 - styles that CSS salt styles / styles and
20:09 - you can see it's Auto completing it
20:10 - already and now that style sheet is
20:13 - connected and linked to my current HTML
20:15 - file and if I hit refresh here you'll
20:19 - see it turns green I'll zoom in just a
20:22 - little bit more so it's easier for you
20:23 - to see now what if I want it you know
20:26 - when it's a if it's a link I want this
20:29 - to be let's say red okay and I've
20:32 - essentially done that so I'm gonna show
20:35 - you what that means so we'll create h1
20:39 - and we'll create a link and this link
20:42 - will say practice or sorry this this
20:46 - link will just not go anywhere for now
20:48 - and the text of this where the content
20:50 - of this will read link header 1 so you
20:57 - can see that the link has a header 1
21:00 - that's red okay and how I did this is I
21:04 - say hey dig in to an h1 tag and if that
21:07 - h1 tag and if there's an a tag or a link
21:11 - tag within that h1 then color it red
21:14 - okay because I'll show you if I have a
21:16 - normal a tag and it is like normal a tag
21:22 - like that look it looks like a normal
21:25 - link okay whereas the header one looks a
21:30 - little different so again these are the
21:32 - you know h1 is a selector and
21:35 - I can you know use that to select it and
21:40 - I can do the same thing and take even
21:44 - further right so I can say that h1 or or
21:50 - I can say that for h2 link on hover what
21:56 - I want you to do is color orange so now
22:02 - what's gonna happen is that if you have
22:04 - a h2 tag and it's a link and when you
22:08 - hover on that link it's gonna turn
22:10 - orange all right so we will comp this
22:15 - guy we will paste it here we will turn
22:17 - this whoops in turn h2 okay you see that
22:24 - mmm when I hover over it it turns orange
22:29 - you can you can do a lot more right so
22:32 - this is just with this is just you know
22:36 - how would work with h1 h2 but if I
22:38 - wanted to let's say now do this with
22:41 - images and let's just let's just grab an
22:46 - image and chess board okay
22:53 - I'll try to grab a smaller image you
22:56 - know nothing too huge and let's just
22:59 - grab this guy actually yeah why not this
23:04 - guy or you know I like checkmates and
23:06 - one so I'm gonna do checkmate in one so
23:10 - these are all positions where your one
23:12 - move away from checkmating you can use
23:17 - these to practice your skills as well
23:19 - paste that here refresh and we see the
23:24 - board okay
23:24 - actually let's see where the checkmate
23:26 - is I think it's white to move in this
23:28 - position oops
23:34 - and okay so I see the checkmate so I
23:40 - would move this Queen all the way here
23:43 - and it's a checkmate because the King
23:46 - cannot take my queen Knight will capture
23:48 - and this Bishop cannot take my Queen
23:50 - because the rook will capture the King
23:52 - so it's a pin alright now what I want to
23:58 - do is let's say I want to maybe add a
23:59 - little bit of shadow or a border around
24:02 - it and make it look you know let's say a
24:05 - little bit nicer I can do that as well
24:07 - so I want to show you now some new kinds
24:10 - of selectors you can use okay so here
24:11 - we'll use an iid and I will give this an
24:16 - ID of let's just say chest um you know
24:20 - made mate in one all right whatever I'll
24:28 - just give this an ID and I'll go to
24:34 - styles a CSS and I will say one and
24:42 - we'll say border-radius
24:48 - and we'll give it like four pixels or
24:51 - something okay did something happen I
24:54 - don't know let's try with more did you
24:58 - guys notice something changed right it
25:01 - became a little bit more rounded around
25:04 - the edges let's try something ridiculous
25:06 - so maybe because he's a difference you
25:09 - see that so now it changed even more so
25:17 - let's just make it a hundred pixels and
25:19 - let's see what it does okay so you can
25:23 - see that there is a pretty obvious
25:24 - change that's taking place but it's a
25:25 - little too much so maybe I want to make
25:27 - it round it and I just want to make it
25:29 - like a little bit rounded not too much
25:32 - now what if I want to add shadows and
25:35 - what if I want to add more and more
25:36 - things around the image okay so for
25:39 - example let's say you add another image
25:43 - like this right and you don't provide it
25:46 - an idea of
25:48 - and let's just say you you leave it as
25:50 - is and let's go back you can actually
25:52 - see the difference between the two and
25:58 - I'm just gonna add another brake line
26:00 - here yeah so brake line I had it so then
26:09 - it can go below it and you you can see
26:13 - that they look much different one has
26:16 - run in corners one does not and so
26:19 - selector I'm using here is an ID okay I
26:22 - can use this ID here again actually let
26:25 - me it's re let me remove the brake line
26:27 - because I think it's just it's not that
26:29 - hopeful refresh so as soon as I use that
26:35 - ID you can see that the rounded corners
26:39 - are here as well so this ID is a form of
26:42 - a selector and I can select things with
26:45 - that ID I can also select things with a
26:49 - class so now I can create a class and I
26:54 - can say chess board so as soon as it is
27:01 - it is a chess board maybe I want to give
27:04 - it a certain radius and if it's a
27:09 - meeting one I want to do something
27:10 - special okay so let's just look at it
27:11 - online okay how to add shadow in CSS
27:20 - okay and let's see what comes up so I'm
27:23 - gonna try to Google things as you would
27:25 - naturally and normally Google things
27:27 - okay I'm not gonna be like well today I
27:30 - want you to go to mdn or Wikipedia cuz
27:35 - that's what people refer you to and yeah
27:38 - it's cool but nobody nobody learns like
27:40 - that like if you're starting out you're
27:41 - just googling stuff that's coming to
27:43 - your mind naturally and then you'll see
27:47 - how I use these as well okay so let's
27:49 - just go here and let's see they got
27:51 - something called box shadow okay okay
27:56 - cool we have some examples of box
27:58 - shadows being used here
28:01 - right there kind of over the top
28:02 - something that doesn't look that good
28:04 - we'll just add in a random box shadow
28:07 - and see how it works
28:09 - box shadow and let's just make it 10
28:15 - pixels apparently it takes in a color
28:20 - let's go to w3schools and it's saying
28:24 - box shadow you can give it a width a
28:28 - height and or sorry a height and width
28:30 - and you can even give it a color okay so
28:33 - you can pass in like multiple parameters
28:35 - for it so let's just kind of copy this
28:38 - guy and let's just paste it here and
28:40 - let's see what happens and what it does
28:42 - okay and you notice that this shadow got
28:47 - added here now I can also just make it
28:49 - Orange
28:55 - right I can can I make this ten pixels
28:59 - and try I can okay it's a little over at
29:03 - the top but that's totally cool now you
29:07 - can also add shadows all around it in a
29:10 - square because right now it's to one
29:12 - side of it if you want it to add it you
29:14 - could do that too so here let's do this
29:17 - now okay well we're gonna do is I
29:20 - deleted that line the border radius line
29:22 - from weight Mayton one and I'm going to
29:24 - now make maintenance all right so to
29:31 - turn things into a class you have to
29:32 - make them into a dot so it's not gonna
29:34 - have a hash tag anymore that's for IDs
29:37 - and I'll take this chessboard and I'll
29:41 - put it up here now I want to show you
29:47 - something different if something's just
29:52 - a part of a chessboard class right so
29:54 - let's say I do this and I say class
29:55 - equals chessboard like that and refresh
30:01 - you'll notice that it has that radius
30:03 - because chessboard has a border radius
30:05 - so you'll see that it has a little
30:07 - circular radius going on now what I can
30:10 - also do is for this one
30:14 - once you can see the difference I can
30:16 - say class is equal to chess board space
30:20 - mate in one
30:24 - okay and notice how this is inheriting
30:28 - from two different classes one is chess
30:30 - board two is Mayton one now if I wanted
30:34 - to look up checkmate in two images I
30:39 - could maybe give them a different oh
30:42 - okay I thought that was actually my
30:44 - video that popped up but that wasn't so
30:47 - if I wanted checkmate in two image to
30:52 - look differently I can copy that image
30:55 - address and I can do something similar
31:00 - paste it in here and and for class I can
31:07 - create a new class okay and try this
31:09 - pause it and and design your mate and to
31:12 - class to look different than the
31:14 - maintenance okay so give that a try
31:16 - right now
31:43 - okay and what I'm gonna do so I already
31:46 - kind of gave you the answer there and
31:48 - now for the class I'm gonna do chess
31:50 - board mate in to refresh and now you can
31:57 - see that the mate so this one the first
31:59 - one is just inheriting from the
32:02 - chessboard class the second one is chess
32:06 - board class and a mate in one class and
32:08 - then this bottom one here is it's
32:10 - getting it from chess board that's what
32:12 - you have the rounded corners and you got
32:14 - the mate in two and it has that little
32:16 - red thing going on okay and you can do
32:18 - that with classes you can go deeper and
32:20 - deeper and deeper with them and inherit
32:23 - from whatever you need does that make
32:25 - sense so this way it's kind of a nice
32:27 - way of of just seeing how all of this
32:31 - works together and I want you to
32:33 - practice that with things too and I want
32:35 - you to practice some things that might
32:36 - break so let's just try something maybe
32:38 - we'll see if it breaks or it doesn't you
32:42 - know who knows let's just give it a try
32:45 - so what I'm gonna say is that if it's a
32:47 - meet in - right on hover maybe the
32:56 - boarders show up okay so let's just
32:57 - refresh mmm that's kind of cool right
33:03 - when you hover over it the boarders show
33:05 - up but otherwise it does not okay how
33:10 - about this we can do something else so
33:13 - I'm gonna leave this as is and and
33:16 - notice I'm just actually playing this
33:17 - around with you live right now okay this
33:19 - is not even structured and the reason
33:21 - why I'm doing this is so you can get a
33:22 - sense of how I'm doing it and the things
33:25 - that I'm enjoying and how I'm actually
33:28 - discovering this stuff and then when
33:30 - you're watching it I want you to feel
33:31 - the same thing that when you're doing
33:32 - this don't be so restrict it to exactly
33:35 - what a tutorial teaches you right play
33:37 - around with and get a feel for it that's
33:39 - where you're gonna make the biggest
33:40 - progress every time I've literally just
33:42 - sat down and taking notes I end up
33:45 - finding out that I haven't made real
33:46 - true progress but when I work on
33:48 - something on my own
33:49 - and then I have it there at the end
33:51 - that's when I make real progress okay
33:55 - cool
33:55 - so box-shadow
33:56 - now we can also make the box shadows
33:59 - cooler we can make them a little bit
34:01 - more different so first I'm gonna make
34:03 - it so right now and hover it doesn't do
34:06 - it but I can make it that on hover if
34:10 - you'll hover on the chess board right so
34:13 - let's do that
34:14 - I'll do chess board and I will do hover
34:19 - and I will say that on hover what should
34:23 - take place is you know it should just
34:26 - show that it's active or that you're
34:28 - actually currently looking at it and
34:29 - maybe there's a box shadow okay and
34:36 - let's just make it ten ten ten ten and
34:41 - let's see what happens I have you know I
34:43 - have to see it and just refresh and so
34:49 - now anything that has a class of chess
34:50 - board if you hover over it it should
34:52 - create a box shadow on it and look at
34:55 - that right it creates a yellow box
34:59 - shadow around those images so it knows
35:04 - that those are selected now could we
35:07 - make it the box shadows a little bit
35:08 - better yes we can and let's try it out
35:11 - so there's a thing called CSS Matic and
35:16 - you can go there and it lets you it lets
35:19 - you create different kinds of boxes okay
35:22 - and lets you do it visually so whether
35:24 - you want to actually create a radius and
35:27 - you want to see you know you want to
35:28 - make it look a certain way so see I can
35:30 - make this box look a certain way right
35:32 - give it a little huh just a little bit
35:37 - of all of it but what I'm gonna go in
35:40 - this box shadow now let's see if we can
35:42 - make a box shadow that's you know kind
35:45 - of even and like a little bit like that
35:49 - you know and again this is a little bit
35:52 - over the top but it's just to make sure
35:54 - that it pops out and you can see it so
35:57 - here I did it now I'm gonna copy this
35:59 - code zoom in a little bit so I guess you
36:02 - could see it a little bit better but
36:05 - here so I made something
36:10 - I'm going to now copy the code that it
36:13 - has given me and that code I will just
36:16 - pop in here okay now do I have to know
36:23 - what all of that code means absolutely
36:25 - not okay I just know where to paste it
36:29 - like I I don't even know how to make box
36:32 - shadows like these because that's to be
36:34 - honest that's not what I spend my time
36:35 - doing like I'm spending that time
36:37 - building back-end in Python or building
36:40 - AP is or doing something more front-end
36:42 - is not really a lot of my thing I don't
36:45 - spend a lot of time doing it but do I
36:47 - know how to put together a
36:48 - beautiful-looking website and use the
36:50 - right resources for them or at least how
36:52 - to research yes and that skill is a lot
36:56 - more important than even you knowing all
36:58 - of this just kind of at the back of your
37:00 - head alright so now I got this you know
37:04 - if I had to guess what these here mean I
37:07 - would assume that it has to do with
37:08 - compatibility between different browsers
37:11 - so you know if you're on Mozilla or
37:13 - WebKit whatever that is probably just
37:16 - gives you some make sure that there's
37:18 - compatibility on all different platforms
37:20 - but if you remove that I'm sure that
37:22 - it'll still look the same so I'm gonna
37:26 - hit save we'll go back here and we'll
37:28 - refresh and so on hover now that box
37:30 - shadow looks a little bit more calmer
37:33 - than our one that was like pretty
37:36 - aggressive right and if you want to
37:38 - color it something you can you can do
37:40 - that too if I delete these I'm sure
37:41 - they'll still work okay
37:43 - that that line is just for adding some
37:45 - extra compatibility and if I want to
37:47 - change this because this looks
37:49 - intimidating you're like oh
37:51 - RGBA are so confusing sure you can
37:55 - change it to orange if you want now when
37:59 - you hover over it has that little orange
38:00 - or make it green and you hover over it
38:04 - has a little green you could do this
38:06 - with images if you want to put cat
38:08 - images you want to put whatever for me I
38:11 - just enjoy chess so I will you know I
38:14 - just choose to do do the chess one and I
38:17 - also found the checkmate here it's
38:20 - rook takes here pawn takes Queen takes
38:23 - checkmate sorry I just love chess okay
38:29 - so you can see that you know we've put
38:32 - together a pretty cool cheesy looking
38:35 - website right now but if that's because
38:38 - we're just playing with a lot of this
38:40 - right we're not worrying about design
38:42 - patterns we're not worried about like
38:43 - what's a minimalistic clean looking
38:45 - website we'll work on a lot of that but
38:48 - for now it's important for you to just
38:50 - get messy and play with it you're like
38:53 - think of it like a you're like a little
38:55 - baby right what is that there's this
38:57 - video that you might have seen and it's
38:59 - like this little baby he's sitting on a
39:00 - countertop and his hands are filled with
39:03 - peanut butter right peanut butter and
39:05 - his entire body is just filled with
39:07 - peanut butter he literally looks like a
39:08 - mummy okay a little fat baby and his
39:10 - diaper and there's like peanut butter
39:12 - all over his body and his mom comes in
39:14 - and she's recording which is like what
39:16 - have you done and he's just looking at
39:18 - her he's like oh and she just like messy
39:22 - right fake peanut butter everywhere like
39:25 - in his eyes like on his in his hair and
39:28 - it's just a disgusting mess yeah but
39:37 - does he care
39:38 - no he's just having fun and he's
39:41 - probably learning what peanut butter is
39:42 - and he's just learning in my best
39:44 - texture and he's just learning about
39:45 - life and just feeling it out but as we
39:47 - grow older and we go to these academic
39:51 - schools or we're going into these
39:52 - professional environments it's like oh
39:53 - you have to take like extremely precise
39:56 - notes and don't ask any questions
39:58 - and don't open your mouth and just shut
40:01 - up the whole time and if you ask
40:03 - something that's kind of dumb everybody
40:05 - else will laugh at you I want you to
40:08 - forget that I want you to take the baby
40:09 - approach and just get messy with it okay
40:12 - do whatever you want try to break the
40:14 - CSS you know look up different tags
40:17 - different selectors you could use play
40:19 - around with it right
40:20 - what about different divs like just Dave
40:25 - having a different background or a
40:27 - different color
40:28 - how about styling your span tags so if
40:31 - you had something in the spent
40:33 - it would look different okay
40:36 - let me show you something something else
40:38 - real quick so let's say that you want to
40:42 - put bullet points somewhere right so I'm
40:44 - gonna I'm just gonna put bullet points
40:46 - at the top and I will say ul and I'll go
40:48 - here I'll say Li and we'll have you know
40:53 - first bullet point and then we'll say
41:00 - whoops and I'll go here and I'll say
41:06 - second bullet point well hit refresh and
41:09 - you can see that I got bullet points
41:11 - here now could you make it in a way so
41:13 - if I hovered over those bullet points
41:15 - they turned orange give it a try right
41:19 - now give it a try right now make those
41:21 - bullet points orange now could you make
41:26 - it so if that bullet point is actually a
41:32 - link it has a color of pink but only if
41:42 - a bullet point is a link not just any
41:44 - link a bullet point that's a link it's
41:47 - pink could you make it so only the
41:53 - unordered lists link bullet point is
41:57 - pink okay let me say that again only an
42:05 - unordered list link bullet point is pink
42:09 - nothing else so for example if I do a
42:13 - ordered list like this and I say and I
42:21 - make this into a link and I say link
42:24 - bullet link ordered bullet point okay
42:30 - this should not be pink only the
42:33 - unordered list bullet point shouldn't be
42:35 - pink so I'm gonna go here I'll paste
42:37 - this
42:43 - okay and again ul is unordered list Oh L
42:46 - is an ordered list so how would you do
42:49 - that well check it out I can go in my
42:51 - Styles at CSS I can drill into UL kul is
42:57 - a selector tag so just you all after the
43:01 - UL I drill into that line and after that
43:04 - Ally I drill into the a and then in here
43:06 - I can say that this should be pink right
43:13 - so color pink
43:18 - save save there you go okay
43:22 - can you do can you do something where
43:25 - the a bullet point or doesn't actually
43:29 - even have bullets next to it or can you
43:32 - do it that link actually doesn't have an
43:33 - underline in there how would you do it I
43:37 - haven't taught it to you so you can look
43:39 - cause II you haven't taught it to me and
43:41 - just give up you get really angry or
43:44 - let's do this okay
43:48 - how to remove underline from links CSS
43:52 - okay you saw it was automatically
43:54 - completing to at some point and styling
43:58 - removing the underline from hyperlinks
44:00 - okay door word don't mean would I say
44:03 - it's a good resource to use for
44:04 - everything no but when I do it when I
44:07 - type it in and this comes up let me just
44:09 - check out what they're saying looking in
44:12 - here let's see does this anything about
44:15 - remove oh that's cool so again as I
44:22 - discovered things you should discover
44:23 - things like this too alright so I'm in
44:25 - here and I can see that link tag you can
44:29 - make it a certain way you can also do if
44:32 - the link is visited what it should look
44:34 - like so if somebody's already clicked on
44:35 - a link then maybe the style of that link
44:38 - should change so if I copy this guy and
44:41 - I go into my styles and I paste this
44:44 - here and I go back to my thing you know
44:48 - maybe the links that I've already
44:49 - visited locus look a little bit
44:52 - different
44:53 - go back and I deleted it cool so that
44:57 - was a cool new thing I learned they also
44:59 - have hover that's fine now note is this
45:03 - text declaration and it says
45:05 - text-decoration:none
45:07 - alright text-decoration:none which means
45:10 - that like if you have
45:12 - text-decoration:underline it'll put an
45:14 - underline on that link okay so i can
45:17 - override a links and how it looks I can
45:19 - say text decoration and I can say none
45:25 - okay so it's still a link but it doesn't
45:29 - have a underline on that anymore so this
45:31 - was a cool resource how about you know
45:34 - Stack Overflow this is always a really
45:36 - good resource and look what it says
45:38 - text-decoration:none you know ignore the
45:41 - the rest of the comment there's like
45:43 - other stuff going on he's talking about
45:44 - important and blah blah but for CSS he's
45:47 - asking hey how can I remove the blue
45:49 - underline and it comes to
45:52 - text-decoration:none okay and look we've
45:58 - put together something pretty cool this
46:00 - turns orange this has different box
46:02 - shadows I hover over it does different
46:04 - things pretty awesome now in the
46:08 - upcoming videos we are going to start
46:11 - building on a project okay and I'll show
46:16 - you what you need to do and everything
46:17 - that you need to learn to get it done
46:20 - and then I'm also gonna show you the
46:23 - solution and walk you through building
46:25 - it step-by-step so even if you don't get
46:27 - the solution and you build it with me
46:29 - you're gonna learn a lot alright and
46:31 - it's gonna be a lot of fun and I'll try
46:33 - to build it mostly from you know kind of
46:36 - scratch together with you so you can
46:38 - watch me go through mistakes and my
46:40 - thought process and how I overcome them
46:42 - if you like this style of learning right
46:46 - this is less structured than like bullet
46:48 - point everything just showing to you
46:50 - it's like we're working through things
46:52 - together and we're coming together if
46:54 - you like this style of learning comment
46:56 - below if you like it and what you like
46:58 - about it
46:58 - if you don't then comment below and do
47:01 - let me know that's it for this video
47:03 - thank you so much for watching as always
47:05 - and I'll
47:07 - you in the next video all right awesome
47:17 - so up until now you've done quite a bit
47:19 - of stuff right you went up in here and
47:21 - you know you build this little project
47:24 - which is kind of cool to be honest but
47:26 - here I want to show you some really
47:28 - awesome stuff okay so I want you to
47:31 - learn how to become a detective now I
47:33 - want you to look at websites like you're
47:34 - almost solving a case alright so you're
47:37 - kind of that criminally put my seat down
47:39 - a little bit cool it's like you're a
47:42 - criminal
47:42 - that's not what I meant I meant I want
47:44 - you to look at it like you're a
47:45 - detective okay and solve it like a
47:48 - detective and don't be a criminal unless
47:51 - your website is criminally good then
47:55 - that's okay
47:55 - so on this website let's say that I have
47:59 - no idea how the hell you did this okay I
48:03 - have no idea how you built this website
48:06 - I have no idea what fonts you use and
48:09 - have no idea how you added that
48:10 - box-shadow and stuff I can come to it
48:12 - just be like oh this is a great website
48:14 - and then just X out and leave and never
48:17 - come back or like a detective
48:20 - I can pay attention and I can actually
48:23 - figure out exactly what you did and
48:26 - wouldn't that be awesome that you could
48:27 - go to other people's website and figure
48:29 - out exactly what they did to make it and
48:32 - then use that for your own website so
48:35 - let me show you what I mean so let's
48:38 - just say that this was a website that I
48:40 - had built and you were just coming to it
48:43 - for the first time and you were like
48:44 - okay this is cool when I hover over the
48:46 - boards it makes it green how did you do
48:48 - that
48:49 - okay let's right click here and we'll
48:51 - click inspect okay and inside of inspect
48:55 - what we'll see is that we have this
48:57 - image tag so when I hover over it it
48:59 - tells me that oh this board is just part
49:01 - of the image this is that image okay
49:04 - and it's even showing me what that image
49:06 - looks like over here and if your dog is
49:09 - not at the bottom click these three
49:11 - collapsible dots and then select right
49:16 - or bottom out whoops
49:19 - I'm gonna hit inspect again spoked and
49:24 - I'll click these collapsibles and put
49:26 - them down that's all so here it's
49:29 - showing me the HTML code that was made
49:31 - to bring this picture up and it's
49:34 - showing me and when I hover over the
49:35 - link it actually shows me what the image
49:37 - looks like what matches this image
49:38 - something ok cool
49:39 - I get where you got the image from I can
49:41 - actually change the image if I want so I
49:43 - can double click into it or I can leave
49:46 - it as is which is cool now this board is
49:49 - part of the chess board class and I'm
49:51 - like interesting a chess board class
49:54 - cool well over here when I go into style
49:59 - when I'm looking at your Styles what I
50:01 - notice is that essentially part of this
50:03 - class in this class chess board all it
50:06 - has is it says border radius 30 pixels
50:09 - which is exactly what we have over here
50:10 - on the left hand side now what I can do
50:13 - is actually turn it off and when I turn
50:16 - it off it shows me their styles on how
50:20 - would the look if the chess board class
50:23 - wasn't activated or didn't even exist
50:25 - and I couldn't be like oh so that's what
50:28 - this person is doing with the chess
50:29 - board class or with the border-radius
50:32 - attribute hmm interesting that's what
50:36 - that does cool now how come there's this
50:40 - orange border around this board let's go
50:43 - figure out what's the situation there
50:44 - right so I can I can acts out of it okay
50:48 - I can even go into hovers and I can
50:51 - actually activate something which is
50:52 - which is kind of cool I can be like hey
50:54 - active focus ok visited hover on hover
50:59 - what does it look like
51:00 - activate the hover mode of this and it's
51:02 - showing us that chess board hover has
51:05 - this ok so the force element state we
51:09 - have forced element state to be in hover
51:11 - and it shows us that this is the code
51:13 - that goes behind it which says chess
51:15 - board hover and this green thing which
51:17 - you can actually see right over here you
51:20 - know like interesting so if I write this
51:24 - code that's what that will do and if I
51:28 - write this code that's what that will do
51:30 - but this will only work on
51:33 - hover interesting what else can I figure
51:38 - it out about this okay so I can now look
51:41 - at this board right here the one on the
51:43 - right hand side Islands hit inspect and
51:45 - I'll hit inspect and it tells me that
51:47 - it's part of the chessboard class and
51:49 - it's part of the maintenance of it's
51:51 - part of two classes and I have both of
51:53 - them activated and it tells me that
51:57 - there's a chessboard class and there's a
51:58 - meet in one class and the main one class
52:01 - what it does is it adds a box shadow so
52:03 - I'm like oh interesting if I turn off
52:06 - that box shadow it goes away how's that
52:09 - box shadow working it says 5px 10px
52:11 - followed by orange cool can I turn this
52:15 - orange into something else oh that's
52:18 - what that looks like
52:19 - interesting what if I change this five
52:22 - pixels to 10 pixels mmm that's what that
52:27 - does what if I add another 10 pixels
52:30 - right here and another 10 pixels right
52:33 - here with that what does that do okay
52:35 - what if I add another 50 pixel right
52:38 - here what does that do hmm not the best
52:41 - looking thing but maybe I'm learning
52:43 - something I'm picking up how this
52:46 - actually works now I can still activate
52:49 - it or deactivate it cool and you see
52:53 - exactly what classes you need okay is a
52:55 - chessboard class I'm eight in one class
52:56 - classes in CSS are represented by this
52:59 - little period an ID will be like a hash
53:02 - tag okay so I've learned a lot so far
53:06 - now I can also go and see how this link
53:09 - an ordered bullet point is working if I
53:11 - wanted to right I can go to this link
53:12 - and I can say okay unordered list I can
53:16 - highlight I can highlight this and I can
53:20 - be like I can click it and once I click
53:21 - it on the right hand side it shows me
53:23 - how the styling is working for it okay
53:27 - so in the styling I can see that it says
53:30 - hey the under the UL under that line and
53:33 - then under the a style it to be pink I
53:36 - can activate it deactivate and it tells
53:39 - me that text decoration is none when I
53:41 - deactivate that line it shows me the
53:42 - default actually has underline so I go
53:46 - there
53:46 - interesting similarly I can go on to
53:51 - this website the project you're supposed
53:53 - to be building write a clever program
53:54 - reddit github that I oh I can go to this
53:57 - and I can say this font is interesting
54:00 - what font actually is it so I can hit
54:03 - inspect and then under inspect I can
54:08 - actually see what type of font it is
54:09 - okay so I can click or click here and
54:12 - it's telling me what font size it is h1
54:15 - 2.5 r.e.m and I can see what type of
54:19 - font it is so lets see if i scroll down
54:22 - it's selling me the font family so it's
54:26 - telling me i found family it's telling
54:28 - me the line height is selling me the
54:29 - font weight and all of that so i'm like
54:34 - interesting we're using railway
54:38 - sans-serif alright it's telling me it's
54:42 - on line 22 under whatever this file is
54:47 - so actually it might actually even take
54:49 - me to the file so now I'm actually
54:51 - looking straight up at the styles at CSS
54:54 - file and I can see that under our
54:56 - content I can see the font that was used
54:59 - the line height that was used to font
55:01 - weight that was used to max width and
55:04 - all of that ok so just to give you an
55:07 - example
55:07 - let me fullscreen this guy so you can
55:10 - see him better you can actually even use
55:12 - a tool like font face ninja
55:17 - and once you hover over it it tells you
55:21 - what font is being used so you can
55:22 - already see it says railway ok railway
55:26 - is a cool font and you can see that it
55:28 - says it's in medium about 40 pixels and
55:31 - 48 pixel line height okay line height
55:33 - means when you press Enter you know how
55:37 - separated are this so it has good
55:39 - spacing and it makes it really legible
55:41 - so you can be like okay cool now what
55:44 - you can do is if you want that same font
55:46 - on the chest project or whatever that I
55:48 - was making here I can go to font stock
55:52 - Google com
55:55 - and I can find railway so I can search
56:00 - for railway and here it is
56:03 - I can go to railway and I can say select
56:06 - this font it popped up at the bottom
56:08 - zoom in a little bit more here and once
56:12 - it pops up I can just copy this thing so
56:14 - I'm gonna just go an import copy it like
56:18 - this so if if I wanted to put it
56:20 - directly into my HTML I would copy it
56:22 - with the style tag but since I want to
56:24 - put it only in my CSS I will put it like
56:27 - this okay so I'll put it in my CSS file
56:31 - all the way at the top okay and and to
56:38 - activate this thing right I'll actually
56:40 - say that whatever is in my body make it
56:46 - this font now let's go back here let's
56:49 - refresh and as soon as i refresh you can
56:52 - see the font looks better right
56:54 - and now when I right click on this and
56:56 - inspect hopefully and then it shows up
57:01 - in body look at the font railway
57:05 - sans-serif and it's looking a lot better
57:08 - in my opinion you'd be like Oh
57:13 - interesting
57:14 - not this guy this guy right over here
57:17 - okay and you can also go to Rafa cause
57:19 - e-comm if you want inspiration from my
57:22 - actual one that I'm using as my business
57:25 - or maybe for whatever reason clever
57:28 - programmer that github that I oh isn't
57:30 - working so you can see how like a
57:34 - detective I can just go figure out each
57:36 - component of the puzzle right and
57:39 - including maybe I can even figure out
57:41 - how to put this nav bar at the top which
57:43 - I want to leave to you as a challenge
57:46 - alright so I've shown you how I would as
57:48 - a detective figure out a lot of these
57:51 - things and I would change a lot of these
57:52 - things but I also want to leave some of
57:54 - these things to you okay other tools I
57:56 - want to give you is you know I can go to
57:58 - this code and I can actually do view
58:00 - page source and when I do view page
58:02 - source it even shows me all the HTML
58:04 - code that was used to build that page
58:07 - now
58:09 - if you go on a really popular website or
58:11 - really website that's visited about a
58:13 - lot of people or it's really big usually
58:16 - their HTML files aren't gonna look this
58:18 - simple usually their HTML files are
58:20 - going to look quite a bit complicated so
58:24 - you know it's not but for ours that
58:27 - we're making it's gonna look pretty
58:28 - simple the HTML code is straight up okay
58:31 - and you can use that to figure out okay
58:35 - how this thing actually works okay you
58:39 - got image tags you got a unordered list
58:42 - you got an ordered list simple enough
58:44 - okay go try that with my website okay
58:50 - clutter program but I github at i/o and
58:52 - see how far you can get in recreating
58:56 - this website one of the things you might
58:59 - need to learn still is how to add a
59:01 - background image here I'll show you real
59:03 - quickly okay let's say I want a
59:07 - background image right I can simply go
59:10 - like this in the body I can say
59:13 - background image and I can provide a URL
59:18 - for a jpg file let's see if I have a jpg
59:21 - I do
59:23 - I'll hit refresh and you can see that
59:25 - now it's not the prettiest image to add
59:27 - to your background but it works okay I
59:30 - can add another you know like if I want
59:32 - to add a pattern kind of like I have on
59:35 - this website here you can see a lot of
59:39 - full screen you can just look up online
59:41 - like minimalistic background patterns
59:44 - and you can use that background image to
59:47 - add as a pattern in the backend now you
59:51 - might have some other questions like hey
59:53 - how do you add padding or how do you
59:55 - actually make this like centered or not
59:58 - to one side or the other one thing I do
60:01 - want to show you is called padding so
60:04 - let's say I'm like what if I wanted all
60:06 - of this to be in the middle right not
60:08 - like if I'm fullscreen this website you
60:10 - see how it's all the way to the left
60:12 - what if I wanted everything to be kind
60:14 - of like mostly in the middle well what I
60:16 - can do
60:19 - is I'll just leave it here for your
60:22 - purposes what I can do for this is I can
60:26 - say pad or actually even max with oh I
60:32 - have to put a semicolon here so it
60:34 - completes it and I can say 600 pixels
60:37 - and then margin I can say zero okay so
60:43 - actually instead of putting a zero there
60:44 - let's put a Auto dare come right back
60:46 - and hit refresh and you can see now that
60:49 - this is now moved more in the middle
60:52 - okay and if I do 800 pixels right and I
60:58 - hit refresh okay so it's like how why do
61:04 - I want this to be let's try 500 cool so
61:13 - you can see that now it's most of it is
61:16 - being aligned in the middle maybe I want
61:20 - to try it 300 okay and now it's even
61:24 - more in the middle and it's reading top
61:27 - down just like that okay so this is what
61:33 - I'm gonna give you use this use the
61:36 - chrome dev tools to put together this
61:39 - website another thing that's gonna be a
61:40 - challenge for you is how did I build the
61:42 - navbar I'm gonna actually give you the
61:44 - resource for that okay navbar CSS w3k
61:51 - literally go to this and use this to put
61:54 - the navbar together okay you can use a
61:56 - vertical navigation bar if you want or
61:58 - build a horizontal navigation bar okay
62:01 - so I actually built a horizontal one
62:05 - just using that and it looks pretty damn
62:08 - good right so just use that for now
62:11 - build your navigation bar put the page
62:14 - together it looks like a really clean
62:15 - page and at the end you know for this
62:20 - you're gonna actually have to use
62:21 - bootstrap a little bit so if you can
62:23 - google that part of it and figure out
62:25 - how to put together a bootstrap form
62:28 - then you can build this but if you don't
62:31 - figure that bootstrap part
62:32 - the bootstrap part is just gonna be at
62:34 - the end okay pretty much nowhere else if
62:37 - you can't figure that out don't kill
62:38 - yourself over it just try to get as
62:40 - close to mine as you can this is more
62:43 - art than science alright so I don't want
62:46 - you to beat yourself up or be like hey I
62:48 - didn't get exactly right as long as you
62:51 - can get close you'll be good our
62:52 - solutions are gonna look a lot different
62:54 - you know when you see my solution but
62:57 - just give it a try and then I'll show
62:59 - you how I put this together and then you
63:01 - can use that to learn as well alright so
63:03 - this project is gonna be a lot of fun
63:05 - and by the way when you click these
63:06 - links nothing really changes okay so
63:10 - it's gonna be a lot of fun I hope you
63:12 - enjoyed this process enjoy working on
63:15 - this project I'm really excited I can't
63:17 - wait to see what you put together that's
63:20 - it for this video and I'll see you in
63:22 - the next video hey you welcome welcome
63:34 - we're going to touch on CSS and
63:36 - bootstrap woohoo what a surprise I know
63:39 - I know but we are gonna be building one
63:42 - big project and in this big project
63:45 - you're gonna learn get a deep
63:47 - understanding of how CSS works how to
63:50 - create forms how to create beautiful
63:52 - buttons how to create stuff where when
63:54 - you hover over it colors change and just
63:58 - beautiful are static websites that you
64:03 - can model after learning this because
64:06 - honestly what I believe deeply is that
64:08 - instead of working on like seven
64:10 - different small projects I don't think
64:13 - that's a good idea what is a good idea
64:15 - is working deeply but on one project and
64:18 - this is something I recommend even as
64:20 - you go on in your journey to learn
64:22 - whenever you learn something and you
64:24 - want to apply it work on one big project
64:26 - and work on it really deeply I've had
64:28 - some really close friends with me or
64:30 - learning coding but to this day they're
64:32 - like okay coders and the real reason
64:36 - behind that is because they just dabble
64:39 - in like 10 different projects just a
64:42 - little bit or just half way but one of
64:45 - the reasons why I was
64:46 - to improve my skills and get him to a
64:48 - really high level was because I would
64:52 - get in that project one project and work
64:55 - on it for a long time and I'm talking
64:57 - about there were some projects I worked
64:58 - on for three to six months even a year
65:01 - long and it doesn't necessarily have to
65:05 - be that long for you but even if you
65:07 - work on one project for like a few days
65:09 - a week a month versus multiple other
65:12 - projects for like half a day
65:14 - super-important okay with that said
65:16 - let's jump into what we're gonna be
65:18 - making this week okay one big project
65:21 - we're gonna make this week so I got this
65:25 - idea from this personal brand I actually
65:28 - started Rafa Kazi comm and this is a
65:30 - business that actually I'm gonna be
65:32 - building and it's gonna be there to help
65:35 - other people build their businesses
65:37 - leveraging the power of YouTube okay so
65:40 - you can see my little tagline here or
65:42 - not little actually a really powerful
65:44 - tagline here how to build your authority
65:46 - overcome obscurity scale your business
65:49 - and build an audience of ideal buyers
65:52 - for your products and services I have
65:54 - some experience in this I started clever
65:56 - programmer I have you here I have other
65:58 - people here so I thought why not let's
66:00 - get it started okay and this is a real
66:03 - website and I'm offering this lead
66:07 - magnet to people which is essentially a
66:09 - free gift for them to give me their
66:12 - email address and generally how these
66:14 - businesses work or you get people's
66:17 - emails essentially their contact
66:19 - information and then the people who are
66:22 - interested in your product when you
66:23 - release your product you can actually
66:26 - eventually sell your product or service
66:28 - right so just like you you got a lot of
66:31 - free value a lot of information for me
66:34 - and you're like I'm winning this is
66:35 - awesome this is great how do I get more
66:37 - well I'm like okay there's some
66:39 - high-level stuff I've made for you maybe
66:41 - the profitable programmer or some other
66:43 - course you might be in and here's how
66:47 - you can get it there's a price for it
66:49 - you pay it you purchase it and there you
66:52 - go okay so we exchange value at the end
66:55 - of the day and that's what this new
66:57 - business model is about it's teaching
66:58 - you how to actually scale
67:00 - for yourself and so I thought for this
67:02 - CSS project for this week to CSS
67:04 - bootstrap project would it be cool to
67:07 - use the knowledge we've already built
67:09 - about HTML and then leverage CSS and
67:14 - bootstrap to actually make a page like
67:17 - this but actually even better than this
67:21 - because III took the time to actually
67:23 - model this page and what I ended up
67:25 - building looks even better than this and
67:28 - so I think you're gonna have a lot of
67:29 - fun working on this okay just like I did
67:32 - so let me go right here
67:34 - so check out so this is a new page again
67:38 - same tagline but now at the top you can
67:42 - see that there is a navigation bar and
67:44 - when I hover over it it has like
67:46 - specific styling that goes along with it
67:49 - and the background pattern looks pretty
67:53 - cool right this is bland it's just white
67:55 - and here we have some subtle
67:59 - minimalistic pattern going on at the
68:01 - background and you know the writing is a
68:06 - lot easier to read on this page in my
68:08 - opinion because the other page it reads
68:12 - from left to right a lot and here it's
68:14 - mostly in the middle so you read through
68:17 - it easier and by the time I get down
68:21 - here you can see that I have a nice
68:25 - little form and this button that says
68:28 - yes gave me first of all it looks really
68:30 - nice this button and second of all when
68:33 - I hover over it notice what happens it
68:36 - changes colors right it changes colors
68:38 - so how does this happen and how does
68:40 - what I hover over this it changes colors
68:43 - and everything right so this is what
68:47 - we're gonna be learning we're gonna be
68:49 - learning a lot more things but
68:50 - eventually our goal is to actually build
68:53 - a replica of this and if you want to
68:54 - check it out I've hosted this online and
68:57 - a cool thing I haven't I didn't even
68:59 - mention till now it's not gonna be one
69:01 - of those projects that you do on freakin
69:03 - Udacity or Coursera or EDX where they
69:07 - always make it sound super cool and by
69:09 - the time you get to it it's like this
69:10 - super terribly lame
69:13 - check that you can like that has like
69:15 - two basic kindergartner things right
69:18 - this one is a real project modeled after
69:22 - my real website were actually have
69:24 - traffic going and not only that but you
69:31 - are going to actually have it hosted
69:33 - online so if you notice that this is
69:36 - hosted online and you can actually go to
69:37 - this link by going to clever program or
69:39 - not github do hopefully this link will
69:42 - still be up by the time you're viewing
69:44 - this video and you should be able to see
69:48 - it there and underneath this video I'll
69:50 - link to the project or somewhere in this
69:53 - module I'll link the project so the
69:56 - solution is there for you so you can
69:58 - always go and look at the right code and
70:01 - what I did to build it okay though I
70:03 - wouldn't say it look at the solution now
70:05 - look at it later alright I hope you're
70:08 - excited we're gonna have a lot of fun
70:10 - learning how to build this and learning
70:13 - some ins and outs of CSS along the way
70:15 - of bootstrap along the way and some cool
70:20 - tips and tricks and another thing I want
70:22 - to focus on is while I want to show you
70:26 - that exact code that was used to build
70:29 - this project what I'm really interested
70:30 - in showing you is the real development
70:34 - workflow of a developer okay so that's
70:37 - what a lot of people don't show a lot of
70:40 - them just make a course and as a teacher
70:42 - teach you what I want to teach you as is
70:44 - not just a teacher but if you were
70:46 - sitting next to me and you were working
70:47 - we used to literally we're watching me
70:50 - work I want to show you how that looks
70:52 - like or if you watched a real software
70:54 - developer work what would that look like
70:57 - okay and you guys might have this in
71:01 - your head or you might have this in your
71:02 - head that you know the software
71:04 - developer you create everything from
71:06 - scratch but that's really far from the
71:10 - truth
71:43 - I paid a lot for is knowing what to copy
71:46 - and paste okay and so that's a very real
71:50 - skill set and I'm gonna be teaching you
71:52 - that as well and so it's just gonna be a
71:55 - lot of fun all right and we're gonna
71:57 - work together we're gonna make mistakes
71:59 - together and we're gonna learn together
72:01 - so by the end of this I want you to have
72:03 - a natural feeling towards how to go
72:06 - about it
72:07 - you know it shouldn't just be that the
72:10 - two things you learn in this course are
72:13 - those are it
72:14 - I leave you the tools to be able to
72:15 - expand your knowledge even when you
72:17 - finish this course okay
72:19 - with that said that's it for this video
72:21 - thank you so much for watching and as
72:23 - always I'll see you in the next video hi
72:31 - welcome in this video we will do
72:35 - something really amazing and you will
72:38 - have a lot of fun because what I'm gonna
72:41 - be doing is building this from complete
72:43 - scratch so I'm not even gonna use my
72:45 - notes there's nothing like that we're
72:47 - just gonna be working on it together
72:48 - trying to make this website and what
72:51 - you're gonna find is a lot deeper
72:53 - insight then even if you just wash me
72:55 - literally write the solution there's
72:59 - gonna be some points where I'm gonna get
73:00 - something wrong something right doesn't
73:02 - matter but I'm gonna work through it and
73:04 - I want you to verbally see how I work
73:05 - through it and see how you even look up
73:08 - solutions online now what I want you to
73:10 - understand is I'm not a front-end
73:11 - developer my front end developer skills
73:13 - suck but I can put together a badass
73:16 - website because I know what to use and
73:19 - where to use it because I know how
73:20 - coding works I can put together a
73:22 - website that looks beautiful cuz I'll
73:24 - even think I'll even figure out how
73:26 - front-end coding works okay it's just
73:28 - all about understanding how these things
73:29 - fit together so let's get started and
73:33 - we're gonna clone this bad boy right
73:37 - here this one this website that I was
73:39 - showing you okay so I'm gonna fullscreen
73:42 - this thing so you can see it one more
73:43 - time and we're gonna put that to the
73:46 - right side and we're gonna start from
73:49 - scratch in our guess code so I'm gonna
73:51 - create a new folder here and it will
73:53 - just call it clone
73:56 - the site okay you can call it whatever
73:59 - you want here I will create a new folder
74:03 - call it styles and inside of styles I'll
74:08 - create a new file called styles
74:09 - that's CSS you should be familiar with
74:11 - this now and then inside of clone Kazi
74:14 - i'll create a new file and I'll call it
74:16 - index.html and we'll get started writing
74:20 - code now in our Chrome I will go here
74:23 - I'll open and clone Kazi site index.html
74:27 - I'll open that and Chrome so you should
74:29 - see this blank page right here and we'll
74:35 - get started okay so first we'll start
74:36 - off with this headline and we'll go from
74:39 - there
74:40 - okay and now I'm literally thinking
74:43 - about it kind of from scratch again okay
74:45 - so before this video I tried to clear my
74:47 - mind so I could start with as blank of a
74:50 - slate as possible and think my way
74:52 - through it kind of out loud and you
74:54 - could work alongside me on this
74:57 - alright so I'm just gonna go through
75:00 - this page a little bit okay so I see
75:01 - that this is probably paragraph and this
75:05 - is some kind of a header so what header
75:08 - is this I'll hit inspect and just find
75:10 - out real quick so it's h1 and here's
75:14 - some styling that is being used for h1
75:16 - that I can see and let's look at the
75:19 - font so the fonts are better being used
75:22 - is railway sans-serif and all of this ok
75:26 - cool so now this part is important I'm
75:30 - gonna try to actually just copy this
75:32 - part okay and and you know again I can I
75:37 - can take this mark off is that right way
75:41 - to say take more take this mark off
75:43 - whatever so I can take this mark off and
75:47 - you can see that when I change it how it
75:50 - affects our writing so this is with the
75:53 - railway San serif font family on and
75:56 - when I turned this off I can't see how
75:58 - much of a difference there but in my
76:00 - paragraphs I can hopefully see the
76:02 - difference here okay one is readable but
76:05 - it's a little close this gives it a nice
76:07 - little breathing room so now I know what
76:09 - line hide
76:10 - used for font-weight you know this makes
76:14 - it way a little bit more okay cool
76:18 - so I'm gonna kind of paste that in here
76:20 - alright now what I know oh I'm sorry I
76:24 - gotta go in my Styles that CSS okay I'm
76:26 - gonna paste it in here so now one thing
76:29 - I already know is that I'm gonna have
76:31 - this class and it's called like our
76:33 - content you could call it whatever you
76:34 - want you could call it something totally
76:36 - different and this is a font family this
76:39 - is the line height font weight and you
76:43 - know let's see what this max width stuff
76:45 - is all about right so notice that when I
76:48 - put it on look at what it does right
76:52 - changes the width here and padding at
76:55 - the top so we'll try to build this from
76:58 - scratch as we go
76:59 - okay I'm gonna remove this but I know a
77:02 - few things already and we need to get
77:03 - the railway font so we'll go to fonts at
77:06 - google.com I rail away right here I will
77:17 - hit the plus sign and copied it okay and
77:21 - I'll click it I will grab the import
77:25 - code I'll paste it in my styles at CSS
77:28 - all the way at the top and then this is
77:33 - the font family okay so I'm gonna go in
77:36 - here and I'll say that anything that
77:39 - goes in the body actually give it that
77:41 - font style okay so I'll say give it that
77:44 - font now let's go to our HTML code
77:50 - I'll hit dock I'll delete these for now
77:53 - and we'll call this cause ease website
78:02 - clone or Khali's website you can call it
78:05 - your own website and when i refresh this
78:10 - you'll see at the top at the tab now
78:12 - says cause ease website so that's good
78:14 - alright so let's get the copy from here
78:16 - the headline and then we'll just put the
78:19 - h1 we'll paste the headline okay
78:22 - and I'm gonna refresh now going into my
78:26 - stylesheet I will make sure that my body
78:29 - has the railway font so font-family
78:34 - railway okay I have this now I'll
78:40 - refresh and hmm that's weird there are a
78:44 - few problems that we notice here first
78:46 - of all it starts from all the way to the
78:48 - left goes all the way to the right and
78:49 - notice this this starts in the middle
78:51 - and also it doesn't look like it has the
78:55 - rail railway font so what's going on
78:58 - there right because like even if I
79:00 - delete this and hit save and come here
79:02 - and refresh it looks the same and when I
79:04 - do this and save and refresh it still
79:06 - looks the same so what's the deal well
79:08 - it's because I haven't linked a
79:10 - stylesheet yet so in my head I'm gonna
79:14 - go and I'll say link and I'll simply
79:18 - link that stylesheet so now when I hit
79:20 - refresh you can see that the railway
79:22 - font is coming in and if actually right
79:24 - click and hit inspect it should show me
79:28 - that the railway font is coming in okay
79:31 - so now I have the font looking somewhat
79:35 - you know good now let's do a few more
79:39 - things so my font looks good but it's
79:44 - still reading a lot from the left and
79:47 - then reading it all the way to the right
79:49 - so it seems a little too much so what I
79:52 - will do is I'll say like Pat it a little
79:56 - bit okay so let me do padding left and
79:58 - I'll do you know 40 pixels let's come
80:03 - here and let's refresh so you can see it
80:05 - added a little bit of padding here and
80:07 - it pushed it to the right now padding
80:10 - can be cool but the problem is that when
80:12 - you on a mobile device it can look
80:14 - pretty weird you know it's like reading
80:16 - every single word on it on its own line
80:18 - and it's okay in terms of centering
80:22 - something so what I'll do is I'll give
80:25 - it a max width of say you know 200
80:30 - pixels just tried 200 pixels and then
80:32 - I'll say margin as auto okay so this is
80:35 - a cool way of
80:35 - making things centered so you can see
80:38 - that it gave it a width and then the
80:40 - rest of it it just says do it Auto so it
80:42 - kind of starts it from the middle and
80:44 - that's essentially the width that it has
80:48 - now let's make this let's give it a
80:51 - little bit more width so I'll do 400 and
80:53 - hit refresh now it reads it in the
80:56 - middle pretty much perfectly but it's
80:58 - still but we need to give it a little
81:00 - bit more like for example you can read
81:02 - business and build an audience on the
81:05 - same line except we business and build
81:08 - an audience for us reads on two
81:09 - different lines so now I know that I
81:12 - still have to make it so it has a little
81:14 - bit more width and let's try 600 here
81:20 - okay products and services products and
81:23 - services cool it's it looks like it's
81:27 - reading in a similar fashion okay how to
81:30 - build your authority the ability that's
81:32 - already great let's see if anything else
81:37 - needs changing so ours is really at the
81:41 - top if you can see and this one kind of
81:43 - has like some space from the top this is
81:47 - just completely touching it so we need
81:49 - to add some padding on the top okay
81:54 - padding top and let's add about 20
82:00 - pixels
82:01 - it was refresh cool and it looks like it
82:06 - gave it a little bit of room and that's
82:08 - kind of what we want and then this image
82:12 - on this website when I right-click I can
82:15 - actually inspect the image and this
82:16 - gives me the URL for the image so I'll
82:19 - just use this URL and I'll go in my
82:22 - index and then I will say image I'll
82:26 - paste that image in and I'll hit refresh
82:30 - or refresh so you can see that this
82:33 - image right now looks really really huge
82:35 - and that's not what we want so in my
82:38 - image I'm gonna add in a height
82:40 - attribute and I'll just say 500 and I'll
82:43 - add in a width attribute and we'll just
82:45 - give it 300
82:47 - okay and you can put quotes around it or
82:50 - not doesn't really matter okay so now it
82:53 - looks a little bit more normal but it
82:55 - looks a little bit squished so we'll
82:59 - give it a little bit more 400 see how
83:02 - that looks compared to it still doesn't
83:06 - look that good when I inspect this image
83:08 - I see that it's a 700 and with 500 so
83:12 - I'm gonna do that for mine to 700 give
83:15 - it 500 save refresh and now it looks a
83:21 - little bit better right and even if I
83:23 - fullscreen the thing it still looks in
83:26 - the center and even if I make it shorter
83:30 - half the screen it still looks like it's
83:32 - in center okay cool so we got the image
83:38 - now what else do we need we need to add
83:41 - the page copyright all of this copyright
83:44 - here and what I recommend is just
83:47 - straight up copying all of this like
83:51 - this or what you can do is go to the
83:54 - page source and copy it from there so
83:57 - that way it'll copy all the line breaks
83:59 - and everything because there are some
84:01 - line breaks in here okay so if you spend
84:03 - time doing all of that it might take you
84:05 - a second though it could be good
84:07 - practice but oops I'm gonna go here also
84:12 - a view page source and everything
84:17 - starting from this PTAC here's what
84:19 - you're right now all the way to this P
84:25 - tag I'll just copy and I'll paste right
84:29 - here I'll hit save we'll go to our
84:31 - website and refresh and you can see now
84:34 - that that copy is on our page okay cool
84:37 - so it's looking good except the lines in
84:45 - between make it a little bit harder to
84:47 - read so we need to give it a little bit
84:50 - more line height okay so I'll go to my
84:52 - Styles at CSS and we'll add some some
84:57 - line height so I'll say
85:00 - line-height 1.2 e em fresh okay do
85:11 - anything let's just do something crazy
85:12 - 4:00 a.m. and you can see that there's a
85:15 - huge difference here right let's try to
85:18 - fresh okay to is looking looking pretty
85:23 - good let's try 2.3 and now it looks like
85:28 - the page has some room to breathe maybe
85:31 - it's even too much it just depends on
85:33 - your taste but when I read these
85:34 - paragraphs I think it's good to give it
85:36 - a little bit breathing room so so far I
85:42 - like how things look they look really
85:45 - good but I feel that reading it this tax
85:53 - doesn't look like it's powerful it looks
85:55 - it was very thin and I don't really like
85:59 - my eyes don't really enjoy reading it as
86:02 - much as this should so what I would want
86:04 - to do honestly is probably make them
86:08 - weigh a little bit more so you can see
86:13 - that when I do 900 it just becomes
86:14 - darker and if I do like 100 and go here
86:18 - it becomes really light so I like how
86:22 - 900 looks okay maybe you can even go 950
86:25 - that's up to you but I personally prefer
86:29 - my text to be kind of dark and feel like
86:33 - it has weight so when somebody's reading
86:35 - it they can go mmm
86:36 - okay there's like there's like power
86:38 - behind it okay so the text is looking
86:43 - pretty good the fonts are looking pretty
86:45 - good now I just need to add that little
86:47 - this thing and then the call to action
86:50 - okay so first we're gonna we're gonna do
86:52 - that call-to-action part this part I'm
86:54 - going to add at the end because this
86:55 - requires bootstrap so I'll show you that
86:57 - later well first let's just go and add
86:59 - this thing
87:01 - so under this P tag I will add an h2
87:06 - because that's not an h1 okay notice and
87:10 - save that copy hit Reef
87:13 - and okay I got this that's good and now
87:16 - I just need to make sure that I have I'm
87:21 - gonna again add this at the end you can
87:23 - add this from the regular forms that I
87:25 - showed you so you can certainly do that
87:27 - for now just leave it blank say input is
87:30 - a you know text or email and we could
87:39 - put the placeholder to be email address
87:42 - okay and then underneath we can say
87:49 - button okay and the button can call yes
87:58 - gimme whoops so here you saw that whoops
88:06 - I have the email address and then it
88:11 - says yes gimme right there okay so I'm
88:14 - just putting like a basic form right now
88:16 - later you can you can make the form
88:18 - cooler like if you want to do something
88:19 - like where I hover over this button
88:21 - maybe it turns orange that's not that
88:23 - hard to do right I can I can um just say
88:26 - something like button on hover you know
88:31 - make make the color orange or something
88:38 - right so now it changes the font color
88:41 - to be orange let's try if we can do
88:47 - background color
88:55 - okay and now the entire button turns
88:57 - orange so you can do something like that
89:00 - for now just yeah or not doesn't really
89:02 - matter we're gonna again create the
89:05 - final version of this at the end we're
89:07 - not gonna pay too much attention to that
89:09 - now so our page is looking clean very
89:13 - readable very nice now let's add that
89:18 - pattern in the background okay so what
89:21 - I'll do is I'll just grab a I'll look up
89:26 - minimalistic minimalistic background
89:31 - patterns and I'll just kind of see what
89:36 - comes up where I got it from was like
89:38 - this subtle patterns thing and so you
89:40 - can get that one or you can get this
89:42 - tic-tac-toe one to be honest I like it a
89:45 - lot might might even like it more so you
89:49 - can actually preview them too which is
89:51 - awesome if you hit pretty view you can
89:52 - see in the back pretty cool so you can
89:56 - have this one too but that's that's a
89:58 - little too much so I'll hit download
89:59 - and now that it's downloaded what I'll
90:04 - do is in here I'll create a new folder
90:07 - I'll just call it images okay and I'll
90:12 - take this image okay the tic-tac-toe
90:15 - image I'll go in the folder HTML crash
90:19 - course clone Kazi site I'll go in image
90:24 - isn't just paste it in here okay you can
90:27 - even link to the online image but you
90:29 - can you can just do it locally to just
90:31 - totally fine we'll go back and inside
90:37 - the body I'll say background image and
90:42 - I'll use URL and since Stiles isn't so
90:48 - inside here notice that next is styles
90:52 - at CSS there are no other files okay so
90:55 - if I from styles at CSS say hey go to
90:59 - images and then inside of images get the
91:02 - pattern image it's gonna be like what
91:04 - the hell are you talking about
91:05 - I don't know where images is so we need
91:10 - to give this a path okay an absolute
91:13 - path or a relative path so for example
91:16 - right if you are and in your house right
91:18 - now you have Starbucks to the right of
91:21 - you what I'll tell you is like hey leave
91:25 - your home walk to the right at Starbucks
91:28 - is right there that's an example of a
91:30 - relative path okay another example would
91:34 - be if you have Panera Bread to the left
91:36 - of you but like walk downstairs go to
91:38 - the Left Panera Bread is right there now
91:40 - if I have to give you an absolute path I
91:43 - might say hey on 20 40 you know
91:48 - Hollywood Street that's where Starbucks
91:52 - is or that's where Panera Bread is now
91:54 - that's the absolute path no matter where
91:56 - you are in the world and the country and
91:58 - state you know where that address is so
92:01 - just like that on your computer each
92:03 - thing has a relative path and an
92:05 - absolute path so what do I mean by that
92:07 - for example this going from you know if
92:13 - you're if you're in this index file the
92:16 - relative paths of the styles are CSS it
92:18 - simply Styles / styles that CSS okay
92:22 - it's a relative path but if I want to
92:24 - get the absolute path you can even see
92:26 - it right now when I hover over it shows
92:28 - me but the absolute path actually says
92:31 - I'll show you what I mean okay I'll open
92:34 - up my terminal so you can see this more
92:37 - clearly all right
92:41 - so I'll go into my github folder all
92:43 - going to HTML crash course folder I'll
92:45 - go into clone clone Kazi folder and and
92:51 - to get into styles I can just do CD
92:53 - styles okay which means change directory
92:55 - into style so I can do this
92:57 - see these styles and him and hit whoops
93:01 - styles and hit enter and I'll go into it
93:04 - or I can go inside of it in another way
93:07 - okay so check it out what I do PDW
93:09 - here's my absolute path right now and
93:12 - I'm gonna now go into styles now when I
93:16 - do PWD you can see that my full
93:18 - addressed and
93:19 - location is user slash clever programmer
93:22 - slash github slash HTML crash course
93:24 - slash clone Kazi underscore site /
93:27 - styles so that's another so that's so so
93:32 - you just saw I got in two styles but
93:33 - just doing CD styles now when I do CD
93:36 - and let's say I'm home I'm really far
93:39 - away I can even go inside of styles
93:42 - directly in one go instead of going into
93:45 - one folder then another folder than or
93:47 - another folder I can just go straight to
93:49 - this entire address I can just do this I
93:51 - can say CD paste that address hit enter
93:54 - I'm in styles again okay so it doesn't
93:58 - matter where I was in the first place
94:02 - now because I'm in my clone Kazi site
94:07 - and I want to get access to that image
94:11 - which is in images right here to take
94:13 - Tac Toe the first thing I actually need
94:16 - to do okay oops
94:21 - actually let's go in here so I'm in
94:24 - Styles at CSS I need to first go back a
94:26 - folder so then I'll be in clone Kazi
94:29 - site directory then I need to go inside
94:32 - of images and then get access to the
94:34 - folder so he'll here's how I'll do it
94:36 - I'm gonna do dot dot and that means go
94:39 - back one directory okay and I'll show
94:41 - you what I mean by that again in here so
94:45 - if I can do show me where I'm at I can
94:48 - do CD github so now I'm in github right
94:51 - so I'll do PWD and they'll show me that
94:53 - I'm in slash user slash clever
94:55 - programmer slash get up if I do dot dot
94:56 - and I do PWD again it'll show me I'm in
94:59 - slash user slash clever programmer so
95:01 - you see I went back a directory by doing
95:03 - dot dot that's what two dots does so I'm
95:07 - gonna go back one directory then I'll
95:09 - say going to images and then after that
95:13 - I'll say what's the name of the image
95:17 - take Tac Toe tic-tac-toe dot PNG okay
95:24 - like that and when I hit refresh you'll
95:27 - notice that that tic-tac-toe image is
95:28 - now linked
95:31 - so looks a lot better to be honest with
95:35 - you looks pretty beautiful so far now at
95:40 - this point it seems like all we really
95:42 - need is that navbar at the top and
95:47 - better-looking form thing and our page
95:50 - is good to go so let's do that let's get
95:54 - that navbar so okay let's just go online
95:57 - how to get navigation bar CSS okay
96:03 - that's what I would Google and let's
96:07 - just go in here in w3schools
96:09 - and here's a navigation bar that's cool
96:12 - here's another navigation bar I like
96:15 - this grey one a little bit this one is
96:16 - cool too but I like the darker one so
96:19 - there's all kinds of different
96:21 - navigation bars there's like vertical
96:23 - ones and then there's horizontal ones so
96:24 - we're gonna go and grab the horizontal
96:29 - one so let's see which one so it's this
96:31 - one okay I wanna grab and it gives me
96:35 - the code for the bar and if I just read
96:40 - the code I'll try to understand and see
96:41 - how it's working so I noticed that here
96:44 - they have the UL which is unordered list
96:47 - so what they're actually using here is
96:49 - an unordered list okay but how does it
96:52 - look like a navigation bar so what the
96:54 - heck are they're doing well what they're
96:57 - doing is that they're making the
96:58 - unordered list but maybe they're making
97:00 - it in a way that instead of the
97:01 - unordered list writing things from the
97:03 - top to down it's writing things from the
97:05 - top to right okay so I'm left to right
97:07 - instead of top down so in just unreal is
97:10 - going this way and why does it look like
97:12 - this well behind this unordered list you
97:15 - can actually just put this grey
97:16 - background right and and you could put
97:21 - some padding so then so did this text
97:24 - home is not all the way to the left and
97:26 - not all of it at the top so we put some
97:28 - padding and from the top so it looks
97:29 - like it's in the middle and we put some
97:32 - padding on the left so it looks like
97:33 - it's in the middle from the left or the
97:36 - right equally and then what we can do is
97:39 - on hover it gets this color and then on
97:43 - hover
97:44 - news can get that color okay all of
97:46 - these at their own color so that's kind
97:49 - of what it looks like this code is doing
97:51 - so what we'll do is we'll we'll copy all
97:58 - of this okay and then so now here's
98:01 - another important part right you copy
98:03 - paste code and then you have to know how
98:05 - to use it now the only way you can know
98:06 - how to use it is when you understand how
98:08 - this all works which at this point
98:10 - hopefully you've seen enough to know how
98:13 - this is kind of working okay and just
98:15 - kind of get a feel for it so you well in
98:18 - my HTML if I make a bullet point list
98:22 - that's that this thing is already gonna
98:23 - be working okay so let's let's just give
98:25 - it a try let's put a are you a list here
98:31 - and let's just see what happens like
98:32 - I'll say hi um say bye and bring this
98:39 - guy here refresh and this is how this
98:43 - list is looking right now not exactly
98:46 - what we want it's because I actually
98:49 - didn't save that Styles at CSS now that
98:56 - I've saved it and I hit refresh it looks
98:58 - like it's coming up now there's not a
99:00 - lot of padding here as you can see zoom
99:03 - in there's not a lot of padding here so
99:07 - we need to make sure that we add some
99:08 - padding so let's go back and see how
99:11 - their example is working okay Liz
99:15 - alright so when the padding actually
99:18 - gets added is when Li a bullet point is
99:23 - a link so if it's a regular bullet point
99:28 - it'll look regular you notice this over
99:30 - here but if you drill in to a li and
99:34 - drill in with a link that's what it'll
99:37 - actually look like this styling is gonna
99:39 - get applied okay you can see over here
99:42 - so now let's actually make these links
99:44 - so I will have the same thing I'll say a
99:47 - and I'll say hi and we'll do a and we'll
99:53 - do bi and I'll come over here I'll hit
99:56 - refresh and notice that styling
99:58 - got applied to it okay this dialing
100:02 - right here boom boom boom boom but if I
100:06 - have a regular link that outside of the
100:08 - unordered list like a regular link like
100:10 - this
100:10 - hello it still just looks like a regular
100:15 - link it's only the link that's inside of
100:18 - a life so you see how with CSS you can
100:20 - get deep into selectors right you can
100:23 - point it and get narrower and narrower
100:26 - with it so it's pretty cool I will
100:28 - delete this guy refresh again and that
100:32 - padding seems pretty cool now what if
100:34 - you're like hey I'm not exactly sure how
100:36 - all of this is working it's kind of
100:38 - confusing me well I'll explain to you
100:41 - how this is working okay pretty pretty
100:43 - straightforward
100:47 - first of all notice text-decoration is
100:50 - none all right so I'm gonna hover over
100:52 - these links they don't have an
100:54 - underlined what else
100:55 - padding I'm adding 14 pixels from the
100:58 - top and 16 pixels from the left okay so
101:02 - what this is doing is actually adding 14
101:04 - pixels at the top 14 pixels at the
101:07 - bottom so it's sandwiched in the thing
101:09 - in the middle from the perspective of
101:11 - the top and the bottom this 16 pixel
101:14 - here what it's doing is adding 16 pixels
101:16 - padding from the left and 16 pixel
101:18 - padding from the right so from the
101:19 - perspective from of left and right it's
101:22 - making it in the middle so as so it's
101:24 - like perfectly in the middle okay so -
101:26 - so to speak how you can check it is you
101:30 - can right click inspect and just turn
101:34 - off the padding and see what happens
101:35 - okay and even from here you can actually
101:38 - change the padding so I can go right
101:39 - here and I can say padding make it 20
101:41 - make it 15 make it 300 make it 10 10
101:48 - what does that do so you can see how
101:49 - this works and maybe if you like
101:51 - something more you can come back to your
101:52 - code and make the following change and
101:55 - if I change the 16 what's happening
101:58 - heading a lot more spacing in the middle
102:01 - you can also change the color you can
102:03 - make it freakin green if you want right
102:05 - double-click Green okay and you can see
102:08 - an ounce of green
102:10 - hit refresh and now it's back to normal
102:14 - okay what is this display:block thing
102:17 - doing let's let's delete it so block is
102:20 - like making it a little bit wider right
102:23 - text-align:center attack is that doing
102:25 - doesn't seem like it's doing much right
102:27 - now a padding is definitely doing
102:29 - something text decoration is doing that
102:31 - so cool now you've learned what each of
102:33 - these pieces are doing that's how you're
102:35 - supposed to learn okay not sit there
102:38 - freaking reading documentation for three
102:41 - days so now I know what this guy is
102:45 - doing but what what is this you all
102:48 - doing right does that totally make sense
102:50 - to us right now maybe maybe not let's
102:53 - check it out let's hit this guy so when
102:56 - we hit this guy you'll notice that
103:00 - before there were bullet points by
103:02 - default but by doing
103:03 - list-style-type:none it's now removing
103:06 - those bullet points cool
103:09 - what is this margin:0 thing doing I see
103:13 - there's a little bit movement so it's
103:14 - doing something not exactly sure what
103:16 - when I do padding:0 it's making sure
103:19 - that the UL has no padding by default so
103:21 - it's overriding its padding cool and
103:23 - what is this overflow doing apparently
103:27 - you can't even see this without the
103:29 - overflow:hidden right so when I make
103:32 - sure the overflow is hidden and
103:37 - background color important right so you
103:42 - want to have that background color
103:43 - otherwise you apparently can't even see
103:46 - this thing so those are two of the
103:48 - important things that you kind of need
103:49 - in there okay cool and then how is this
103:54 - working so when you hover over it it's
103:56 - changing colors it's getting a little
103:58 - bit darker well what's actually taking
104:00 - place there is that you have on a li
104:02 - when on an li link if you hover on a
104:06 - bullet point link this happens okay so
104:10 - it's a very specific situation when that
104:12 - actually takes place you can even make
104:16 - it that the freakin background image
104:19 - changes to something else you know you
104:21 - hover over and the background image
104:22 - changes to cat
104:23 - you can do whatever you want you could
104:25 - add multiple lines of code in here okay
104:27 - so on my website it says Rafa Kazi and
104:30 - then it says courses and then it says
104:32 - Heiner me so I'm gonna go back here I'll
104:34 - say Rafa Kazi I will say courses and
104:41 - then I will say hire me okay cool let's
104:47 - look at it Rafa Kazi courses hire me
104:53 - there's one little problem the bar is
104:56 - not running along there's padding at the
104:58 - top which we don't really want and when
105:02 - I scroll up and now and the bar is there
105:04 - with dust but I'm gonna scroll up and
105:05 - down here the bar doesn't actually stay
105:06 - there so those are the few changes that
105:08 - we're gonna need to make also notice
105:10 - that this is orange you're active in
105:12 - here it's not so we'll figure out what's
105:14 - taking place there in just a second okay
105:22 - so first thing I want to do is I want to
105:25 - make sure that this bar is by itself and
105:30 - not doing this weird thing that it's
105:32 - doing here hmm so how would I actually
105:36 - go and fix this the problem I think
105:42 - that's happening here is that this bar
105:48 - remember how we created this body right
105:52 - and everything everything that's in this
105:54 - body it's supposed to be centered well
106:00 - this navigation thing that we made is
106:03 - actually in that body right inside of
106:07 - the body tag and because of that it's
106:10 - also being centered so we need to do is
106:13 - we need to make sure that the the
106:15 - content of the website that's on the
106:17 - page is somehow being handled in a
106:22 - specific way where it's being centered
106:23 - because the content is what needs to be
106:25 - centered right and then the navigation
106:27 - bar shouldn't be part of that content
106:29 - and it shouldn't be kind of separate so
106:32 - how do we do that
106:33 - well how about this let's do this
106:37 - let's make sure that the navigation bar
106:39 - is in its own div and we'll just give it
106:44 - a class of navigation we don't know if
106:45 - we're gonna use this class or not okay
106:51 - and so we've put the navigation in its
106:58 - own class that's not gonna do anything
106:59 - okay right now so even if you're refresh
107:01 - '''l things gonna happen and we're gonna
107:03 - put all of the content in another div
107:05 - and we'll just call this class our
107:08 - content call it whatever you want I'll
107:12 - go at the bottom whoops and put it right
107:15 - here okay cool all right now if again if
107:24 - I hit refresh
107:25 - nothing is taking place but here's what
107:27 - we're gonna do I'm gonna go in styles
107:29 - I'll create a class called our content
107:32 - and inside of this class I'll add this
107:36 - stuff because we only want our content
107:43 - to be centered now let's hit refresh and
107:46 - you'll notice that the navbar now runs
107:49 - across fine which is what we want and
107:51 - our content is centered so that's pretty
107:57 - good but for whatever reason there's
107:59 - still that padding at the top either you
108:01 - can notice right so we need to not
108:03 - remove that padding we can hit inspect
108:05 - on this navbar and let's actually see
108:09 - there's this padding on the top if I
108:10 - remove that padding notice the bar goes
108:13 - up higher so let's actually do that so
108:16 - this padding this doesn't need to be
108:19 - added to the navbar
108:20 - but it needs to be added to the content
108:22 - because we don't want this how to start
108:24 - from right over here it's gonna make it
108:26 - look really murky and mixed in with the
108:29 - navigation bar so we like that that
108:31 - padding is there so what we'll do is
108:33 - we'll take this padding and we'll add it
108:36 - right here now notice that for our
108:39 - content I don't actually need to add the
108:42 - font settings in here and the reason for
108:44 - that is because it's inheriting from the
108:46 - body okay because our content is
108:49 - give and that's underneath body it's
108:52 - inheriting the the fonts from the style
108:58 - of the body okay and now when I hit
109:01 - refresh
109:02 - look the bar is a lot higher it's still
109:07 - not perfectly at the top but it's still
109:09 - a lot higher okay let's hit inspect and
109:14 - and you'll see that the it says
109:17 - inherited from body okay that's where
109:20 - the font is actually coming from cool
109:26 - let's go right here so it's it's looking
109:31 - better at this point so because of the
109:35 - line height let's go nope not the line
109:38 - height okay now let's work on something
109:44 - else so the bar is looking decent well
109:46 - troubleshoot this little space here at
109:49 - the top and that little space to the
109:52 - left and what's going on there in a
109:54 - second now let's make sure that this
109:57 - thing the word says Rafa Kazi turns
110:01 - orange when we Aurora's orange the
110:06 - entire time okay since we're on the home
110:08 - page so what I'm gonna do is that for
110:11 - now I'm just gonna provide anchor tags
110:12 - okay so I'll say Rafi this part doesn't
110:17 - have anything to do with it turning
110:18 - orange by the way okay
110:25 - so I'll hit refresh here and now I'm
110:28 - gonna click higher me you'll see at the
110:30 - top it has that anchor tag and I had
110:32 - courses it'll say courses when hit
110:34 - Raphael said this so anchor tags are
110:36 - cool to add just to make sure that your
110:38 - links are working without actually
110:40 - directing you to another website because
110:42 - that's annoying sometimes and that's
110:45 - also somehow sometimes they do that you
110:47 - know you've seen on websites right where
110:49 - you it's like a one page website and you
110:51 - click something and it takes you all the
110:53 - way down here well how that works is you
110:56 - can actually provide this an ID of you
111:00 - know hash tag
111:02 - courses or something and so when you
111:04 - click here you can make it so that it it
111:06 - takes you to this div here okay it's
111:10 - kind of like a selector so you can just
111:12 - give it the action hey take me right
111:14 - there all right let's make this guy
111:22 - orange now so I'll go back to that
111:27 - website CSS navigation let's see if what
111:31 - it says about an active link right so
111:33 - here I'm on the CSS so as the CSS pages
111:35 - green how do we do that so here's an
111:38 - example active slash current navigation
111:40 - link it's just this line of code cool
111:44 - we'll add it in somewhere close to that
111:48 - paste it and just say orange in our case
111:54 - so notice that because it says dot it's
111:57 - a class and I'll go in here and what
112:01 - I'll do is I'll just make this bullet
112:03 - point and make it from the class that's
112:06 - active go back here hit refresh there we
112:11 - go good all right
112:13 - so now you'll see that this thing is
112:15 - perfectly orange just like what we
112:17 - wanted okay
112:19 - orange or not orange or sorry yeah
112:22 - orange cool so our navbar is looking a
112:26 - lot better pretty much exactly what we
112:31 - want
112:32 - okay hovers you click on it whatever and
112:38 - so right now since we're working on the
112:40 - index page that's why this is orange if
112:42 - you were on the courses HTML page and on
112:45 - that page you'll have the same
112:47 - navigation thing but instead of putting
112:52 - class active on Rafi
112:53 - you'll put class active on courses and
112:57 - so then courses will be orange on that
112:59 - page so when you click on this it'll
113:01 - take you to the courses out HTML page
113:02 - and this actually will be orange the
113:04 - whole time all right good
113:11 - now what we need to do is add in the
113:14 - bootstrap functionality so then that way
113:18 - this looks beautiful and this button
113:21 - actually looks more beautiful okay and
113:24 - you'll see what bootstrap is bootstrap
113:27 - is literally just a CSS file it's just
113:30 - like a really big CSS file and you can
113:33 - actually just get access to it so you
113:35 - know how we have made all these classes
113:36 - our content button hover this special UL
113:40 - one us as CSS is what is used to made
113:43 - Twitter or sorry bootstrap is what is
113:46 - used to make you know Twitter as well
113:48 - and you just get access to a lot of
113:51 - built in classes in CSS and built in
113:55 - divs and all that stuff and so you can
113:59 - just use their already created styles so
114:02 - for example right where we're creating
114:05 - this form or we're creating this button
114:07 - we could actually just use a button
114:09 - right from bootstrap and we don't have
114:11 - to design our own button we can just say
114:13 - something like button class bootstrap
114:15 - button for example and it'll turn the
114:18 - button into a beautiful button that you
114:20 - didn't have to write any CSS for it just
114:23 - kind of happened automatically okay and
114:25 - that's what we're going after so I'm
114:29 - gonna come in here and I'll add in
114:33 - bootstrap functionality so what we'll do
114:35 - is we'll go strap CDN click right here
114:45 - and here is bootstrap complete CSS okay
114:52 - so you can download this file if you
114:56 - want but I don't want to download the
114:59 - file I just want to get it so I can link
115:01 - to it and now if I go online actually
115:03 - paste this link in it's just a big CSS
115:05 - file okay just a giant CSS file and
115:10 - that's all of this it's all of bootstrap
115:15 - you could download it and put it locally
115:18 - on your computer I just like to link to
115:20 - it so now let's go here we're gonna say
115:24 - a link that's it okay so this is an
115:28 - example of a local CSS file this is an
115:30 - example of a CSS file that's actually
115:33 - hosted online okay I'll hit refresh and
115:37 - now notice it the CSS God or the styling
115:42 - automatically got a little bit better
115:44 - right you notice what actually happened
115:46 - at the top now there's no spacing
115:49 - anymore and there's no beaded padding at
115:51 - the top CS bootstrap automatically comes
115:54 - with a lot of intelligent built in
115:57 - things and when I hover over it turns
116:00 - blue gets that underlined which makes it
116:03 - look nicer to be honest it changed the
116:05 - font a little bit which is totally fine
116:08 - not that big of a deal and at the bottom
116:13 - here we still are running into this
116:15 - problem where this form is not looking
116:17 - nice so we're kind of use some bootstrap
116:20 - bootstrap built and stuff so what I'll
116:23 - do is I'll just literally type in how to
116:26 - make a form in bootstrap okay that's
116:31 - actually what I would Google because I'm
116:33 - not sitting there making bootstrap forms
116:35 - all day so I'll just forget I come
116:37 - across this and this is a cool-looking
116:43 - form that's kind of what I want I want
116:45 - to email address and I want a submit
116:47 - button so I'm gonna just pop this guy
116:52 - completely and I'll replace my form with
116:56 - that form and I'll hit save
116:59 - I mean needs to be like this there we go
117:12 - that looks properly indented I'll hit
117:14 - refresh and now look at that look at
117:18 - that it's looking really clean if you
117:22 - want it like this you could leave it
117:24 - like this if you don't want the
117:25 - password1 right we can just go in here
117:28 - to lead this this this and this and that
117:31 - should remove the password okay this is
117:36 - the entire email thing so if you deleted
117:38 - this it'll delete all of the email stuff
117:40 - and if you delete this it'll remove the
117:43 - check box and we don't need the check
117:45 - box we'll remove that I hit refresh this
117:49 - check box is not gone so you could leave
117:52 - it like this if you want but what I like
117:54 - is just the email bar with the yes give
117:59 - me button okay you could you could
118:01 - decide to keep this button if you want I
118:03 - don't really like it and I also don't
118:05 - see the reason to put this email address
118:07 - at the top it says enter email pretty
118:09 - clear I think what it's asking for so
118:13 - what I'll do is first of all I'll so
118:18 - notice something now okay
118:20 - if I do this right and I don't give it a
118:24 - class and I hit save and hit refresh
118:25 - this is your regular button that comes
118:28 - with a regular CSS okay if I give it the
118:32 - class that it had
118:39 - this is a class that's actually being
118:42 - used from bootstrap and even when you
118:44 - hover over it
118:45 - bootstrap has its own default I can even
118:50 - look it up crap default bootstrap
118:55 - buttons
118:56 - alright and you can go there and it'll
119:00 - show you all kinds of buns so to get
119:02 - this button you're gonna have to do
119:04 - button buttons secondary class this
119:07 - class right here okay if you want to get
119:09 - this danger button all you just have to
119:11 - do is button button danger these class
119:14 - is already built in isn't that nice you
119:16 - get beautiful buttons that you don't
119:17 - have to design that just come already
119:19 - built in there's all kinds of other cool
119:21 - stuff that you can do buttons you want a
119:23 - large button you want a small button
119:26 - maybe if you want to icon on the button
119:28 - you could put different kinds of icons
119:30 - on them too so we'll just go back to our
119:35 - website for now and I'm gonna change
119:39 - this button to say yes gimme refresh so
119:43 - now I got that button that's cool I
119:45 - don't need this line because I don't
119:47 - need to have that label I don't care we
119:51 - I don't even need this ID stuff you know
119:53 - if you need it for later I don't need
119:55 - this aria whatever so I'm gonna delete
119:57 - it okay and for placeholder I'm just
120:02 - gonna say
120:13 - email address so I got the email address
120:20 - right here and this is clean enough if
120:23 - you want to keep it like this but I just
120:25 - want to change a few more things and I
120:27 - want to add the bun to the right of it
120:28 - so I'll so then now that is gone and I
120:31 - want this bun to the right
120:32 - how do I put this button to the right oh
120:35 - my god do I have to notice from scratch
120:37 - no do I even know this realistically
120:41 - honestly right now how to add this
120:43 - button to the right not really
120:45 - and I don't care I can look it up a line
120:49 - button on same line I'll just write like
120:53 - what I would write as a normal human
120:54 - bootstrap CSS okay just fill it with
120:58 - keywords here comes up Stack Overflow
121:01 - link it says why don't buttons and
121:04 - inputs a line well in bootstrap I tried
121:06 - something simple like this and
121:07 - apparently he got something that doesn't
121:11 - align really well okay so look at this
121:13 - and then look at his button you know why
121:15 - he got 236 up votes by the way getting
121:18 - the equivalent of 236 up votes on Stack
121:21 - Overflow is like probably a billion
121:25 - people viewed this thing because it's
121:27 - such high quality like not a lot of
121:28 - people will vote but when you get this
121:30 - many votes it's like a lot of people and
121:32 - you can actually see right here view 281
121:36 - thousand times okay so something that's
121:39 - people look up a lot the same reason why
121:42 - developers you Stack Overflow I use
121:44 - tackler flow a lot for this reason I get
121:47 - my answers like this and now he has some
121:50 - answer and those guys like if you want
121:51 - to group the button on the left side use
121:53 - this if you want to group the button on
121:55 - the right side use this so cool I'll
121:57 - look at this and basically he's putting
121:59 - the class into an input group so that's
122:02 - the div that he's actually using cool so
122:06 - here instead of using a form group it
122:09 - seems like we're gonna be using an input
122:12 - crew okay that's one insight I got from
122:15 - it and then when he's making the button
122:20 - what he's doing is that he's doing okay
122:23 - so input type we have input type
122:26 - we don't want the tax type because email
122:28 - will actually have an email field and
122:30 - what's cool about an email field is that
122:33 - this is something that comes built in
122:35 - with HTML is Allah LeMat automatically
122:38 - check for it so if I try to hit submit
122:40 - it'll say hey please include an @ and
122:43 - when I tried to hit it again it'll say
122:44 - hey please enter off part following the
122:46 - @ sign if I do this you know it'll it'll
122:50 - go okay cool
122:51 - so it has a few things built into it
122:56 - let's go back so my input type is there
123:02 - which is totally fine but what I need
123:05 - and this div actually needs to close
123:10 - here okay so the button and everything
123:13 - else needs to be included in that div
123:16 - the email and the button needs to be
123:18 - included in that div what else type
123:23 - button go all right now I need a span
123:26 - tag this is important so span class
123:31 - equals input group button delete this go
123:38 - here paste it here and oh sorry
123:42 - indenting is just important for it makes
123:45 - it more readable and let's go back
123:49 - refresh and boom I got this email
123:53 - address this is to the side of it crate
123:56 - 20 to go can I go into a deep rabbit
124:00 - hole and figure out how it works yeah do
124:03 - I need to know don't really care all
124:06 - right so now our text is not looking as
124:09 - good as this text so we got to just see
124:11 - all right what's going on do some more
124:15 - trial and error and get to the bottom of
124:18 - this situation so we'll hit well head
124:22 - inspect and see what's going on with our
124:24 - styling so lion hi 2.5 a.m. what's our
124:28 - line height 2.3 m
124:36 - so we can make it 2.5 let's go back here
124:41 - let's sit refresh would it make a
124:44 - difference if we added here yes it does
124:47 - so we'll make sure that we have the line
124:50 - height here so our line height is now
124:52 - looking much better and a lot more
124:54 - readable see there's a lot of like trial
124:56 - and error and you try some things and
124:58 - see how that work and what actually
125:00 - takes place okay let's just double check
125:06 - if our font family is even being used so
125:09 - let's go here let's paste this whoops so
125:14 - for whatever reason our font family was
125:16 - not being used now it should be being
125:18 - used let's put the weight here as well
125:22 - refresh now the weight is being used
125:31 - okay now our stuff is actually looking a
125:35 - lot better than it was looking before is
125:41 - there anything else we need from here
125:43 - that it's not doing alright so another
125:46 - thing is that notice on this page we
125:51 - have some space here and then notice on
125:54 - our current website the one we're
125:58 - working on there's no space at the
126:00 - bottom so we're gonna add some padding
126:02 - in the bottom as well
126:04 - padding bottom
126:16 - let's go here let's make sure all our
126:19 - divs are closing correctly if this div
126:22 - is closing here forum is closing this
126:26 - div is closing span is closing stiff
126:31 - body okay and now we got some spacing
126:38 - action going on at the bottom we can
126:40 - actually add some more spacing I think
126:42 - I'll make it look better so now we got
126:47 - some more even some more spacing so now
126:50 - I think this looks good and the font is
126:53 - looking good you can still change it if
126:55 - you want to whatever hire me and all the
127:00 - buttons are working and there you have
127:05 - it okay we just made a pretty cool
127:11 - website really modern hyper-modern
127:15 - minimalistic from scratch and it looks
127:20 - beautiful and this was some of the
127:22 - front-end part now you get better at
127:25 - front-end and you learned the backend
127:27 - skills and you use a website that people
127:29 - would want to use and on the backend you
127:31 - have cool stuff happening you know if
127:33 - you're learning Python or whatever it is
127:35 - you could make really powerful apps okay
127:37 - and now you have the ability to make
127:39 - apps that people will actually want to
127:42 - use and people would want to play around
127:46 - with right and yeah that's it thank you
127:49 - for working on this project I really
127:51 - hope you enjoyed it that's it for this
127:54 - video and as always I'll see you in the
127:58 - next video
128:02 - [Applause]
128:06 - all right so here we have a basic HTML
128:10 - file okay you can I mean you should know
128:13 - some basics of HTML and CSS if you're
128:16 - watching this video if you don't know
128:19 - them then go and watch like the CSS
128:22 - crash course in HTML crash course that
128:24 - we have and then outside of that so
128:26 - these are the two files what they look
128:28 - like now we are currently on a platform
128:30 - called scrim ba' which another cool
128:32 - thing about this is you'll be able to go
128:34 - back to this exact video on scrim bo you
128:37 - can scroll to any point and you can play
128:39 - with the code at any point you could
128:41 - play with our code and change things and
128:43 - see what differences it makes boom we're
128:46 - gonna be going over a complete guide to
128:48 - flexbox the CSS tricks because these
128:51 - guys are awesome so we're gonna be
128:52 - covering some of what they're talking
128:54 - about and we're gonna be coding this up
128:57 - together all right now for you we have
129:00 - put together a basic index basic HTML
129:04 - file very very tiny with a container and
129:08 - just some items and then we have a basic
129:10 - styling file which has certain
129:13 - properties like for example we want the
129:15 - container to be standing out so on the
129:17 - right hand side you can see the
129:19 - container has a yellow golden border
129:23 - just so you can see that that's a
129:25 - container then all the divs inside of
129:28 - the container just has a little bit of
129:30 - styling so we have added like for
129:31 - example if I change it to 1 or 3 the
129:34 - size of the font changes and then main
129:37 - things are the items so we have a brown
129:39 - purple and black and brown purple and
129:42 - black right to the right hand side now
129:45 - what we want to do is we want to show
129:46 - you how flex flex boxes will actually
129:50 - help you with your code so the first
129:54 - thing you want to do to activate flex
129:56 - box is the main command that you need is
129:57 - the equivalent of like turning on a
129:59 - switch and then turning on a switch and
130:02 - then turning off a switch yeah so
130:04 - display flex yep basically like
130:09 - importing the Flex box functionality
130:11 - pretty much just like importing a
130:13 - library
130:13 - blah blah blah so that just activated it
130:16 - right correct as they can see on the
130:18 - right side yep so display flex flex
130:20 - will activate the Flex box now what has
130:24 - happened effectively is that container
130:26 - has turned into a flex box so any items
130:31 - that go inside of this container will
130:33 - have some of the flex box properties and
130:35 - now you can actually call them yeah so
130:38 - it's pretty much it automatically just
130:39 - sticks it all into a row and it
130:41 - automatically starts by default it's
130:42 - default settings is just to have like
130:43 - while you're resizing stuff it or does
130:47 - it I don't know I don't actually know
130:48 - the complete defaults but pretty much
130:50 - it's just activated and now I can set
130:52 - all the settings you want yep so
130:53 - obviously we have the Flex direction of
130:56 - flex row now let's go to CSS tricks and
131:00 - let's see what it's saying obviously it
131:01 - says the first thing you need is just a
131:03 - display flex because otherwise it won't
131:07 - be activated with this now it has been
131:09 - activated enables a flex content for all
131:12 - its direct children and let's now
131:15 - discuss what the Flex direction does
131:18 - right so we have flex direction you can
131:21 - go left to right which is the default
131:23 - which is what Rho is now if we go back
131:27 - here if you go flex Direction this one
131:29 - this is Rho reverse if I do reverse this
131:32 - just gets flipped over like this we have
131:35 - column right here so if I change this to
131:39 - call them boom you have it in columns
131:44 - okay now if I do column reverse you can
131:50 - see that it just flipped it but in a
131:51 - column now where this could be helpful
131:54 - for example is you could say anything
131:57 - that has a width less than 800 or with
132:00 - less than 600 meaning like kind of when
132:03 - you're on a mobile device or something
132:05 - you can say hey make it a column mmm if
132:08 - you are on a medium size device like a
132:11 - tablet or a large size device like a
132:14 - desktop you could say do a row so that's
132:17 - where these things could come in handy
132:19 - and now you don't have to do that ugly
132:21 - part of the math that normally you have
132:23 - to do here you don't need any math you
132:26 - just use flexbox and it handles all the
132:28 - messy math for you in one word
132:32 - yep so let's leave this here row no
132:36 - wrapper when I was the default but let's
132:38 - just leave it like let like this and
132:40 - let's go here and let's do justify
132:42 - content and we can do justify content
132:45 - and let's just talk about what justify
132:47 - content does okay
132:50 - so let's go to justify content right
132:52 - here and you could have justified
132:54 - content like left justified you could
132:57 - have it maybe more right justified by
133:00 - doing flex and or centered I personally
133:04 - like the space around or spaced evenly
133:07 - quite a bit so let's just give it a try
133:10 - it let's go justify content and we will
133:11 - do flex start which is the default so if
133:16 - I hit save it won't really change much
133:18 - but now let's do end and you can see how
133:20 - things just moved over to the right now
133:24 - let's go from flex and instead of flex
133:28 - and we will go space which one you want
133:32 - to do between yeah sure we're gonna try
133:34 - all of them so space between space
133:37 - evenly mm-hmm okay and then you have
133:40 - space around so there you have how you
133:45 - can justify content and again if I
133:48 - change its size you will see how it
133:52 - works right and now you will also see
133:54 - the problem that we we get into is even
133:58 - if we go smaller screen it still just
134:00 - keeps running so we have to fix that and
134:03 - in all it puts it all in the same row
134:05 - now how do we deal with that problem
134:08 - where it just keeps putting everything
134:10 - in one goddamn row instead of doing that
134:12 - we wanted to move over to the new line
134:14 - if the space runs out to automatically
134:18 - wrap to any screen size pretty much yep
134:21 - so well it makes it really easy we can
134:24 - do flex wrap wrap and that's about it
134:27 - okay now things just wrap so if I start
134:31 - going closer it'll just wrap so now it's
134:33 - pretty much mobile-friendly pretty close
134:36 - to it automatically this is what we love
134:39 - about the Flex box if you're dealing
134:41 - with images and things of that nature
134:42 - you definitely want to have
134:45 - flexwrap on other things that are cool
134:48 - about flexbox yeah we have a thing
134:51 - called order we can order them kind of
134:53 - however we want now if we go and go here
135:01 - and I go order one you can see which one
135:05 - got ordered what now if I add in order
135:09 - to you can see what happens here and if
135:12 - I do order three we have the default
135:16 - order that we had originally yes you can
135:19 - kind of manually order each item
135:20 - independently which is what this allows
135:23 - you to do it's just like numbering them
135:25 - in a certain order like the elements of
135:26 - a list or something yep exactly of a
135:29 - sorted list so yeah so you have like the
135:31 - default which is just all the way
135:33 - through or you're gonna reverse or you
135:35 - can manually order them any way you want
135:36 - so you have full freedom yes you make it
135:39 - look maybe you want to do two one three
135:40 - or something so you can change that in
135:43 - the order that you want all right so
135:46 - this is why order this is where order
135:48 - can come handy now let's take a look at
135:54 - few other properties that you might need
135:56 - like to be honest these are them
135:58 - these are the most common and simple
136:01 - ones you need to just get started
136:03 - alright these are the most common simple
136:06 - ones you need to just get started and
136:08 - again just in case you're seeing how
136:11 - this is working we have one container
136:14 - and then we have bunch of divs inside of
136:17 - it okay and each div has a class item
136:19 - one item two item three which is why we
136:21 - have class item one item two item three
136:23 - all right browsers support another
136:27 - important thing you want to take a look
136:30 - at flexbox
136:31 - has browser support pretty much with all
136:34 - browsers now you probably don't want to
136:38 - be using Internet Explorer but if you're
136:41 - using the 11 Plus you have accessibility
136:45 - to flex box with Chrome Safari and
136:48 - Mozilla Firefox you obviously have the
136:50 - flexibility to use it now where it says
136:54 - new or new that's where you can add the
136:58 - regular syntax of just saying flex on
137:01 - the older ones you might have to say
137:04 - flex box or if we are if you get really
137:09 - old you have to say box for example we
137:13 - have a file here which is a very simple
137:17 - file with one context container and
137:19 - everything else is just a flex item we
137:22 - can resize this image and you'll see
137:24 - what it does we can go to its CSS and in
137:29 - the CSS to add compatibility for
137:32 - multiple browsers you can see how they
137:34 - have done it
137:34 - WebKit which and Mozilla they did box
137:38 - and for other stuff they did either flex
137:41 - box or flex these you honestly just want
137:45 - to look them up online and see what's
137:49 - the best way to add compatibility across
137:52 - multiple different browsers but if you
137:56 - just write it very simply and you just
137:57 - do display Flex most of the browsers if
138:00 - people have the newer versions your code
138:03 - will run but you definitely want to make
138:05 - sure that you have compatibility in all
138:06 - of them hopefully this gives you some
138:09 - idea of how flex boxes are used what we
138:12 - can do is we can add in multiple items
138:16 - here so you can get more of an idea of
138:19 - what's happening there we covered the
138:26 - basics of Flex box that you need to
138:30 - immediately get up and running mm-hmm we
138:34 - will have the source code in the
138:36 - description below for you to go and use
138:40 - now we're gonna be jumping into the next
138:43 - portion of the video where we're gonna
138:44 - be building a few mini projects that
138:47 - require flex box so you can get the idea
138:50 - behind them one of them is going to be
138:53 - your aging days and then the second one
138:56 - is going to be what is it going to be
138:58 - it's the cat generator random cat meme
139:01 - give which is gonna be a lot of fun
139:03 - there's random ass cats in there and
139:05 - good luck trying to focus on the code
139:09 - but I think you'll learn a lot and
139:11 - you'll enjoy it and what we would love
139:14 - for you to do is build it and then drop
139:16 - it in the comments below and we'd love
139:18 - to even check out your code cool
139:20 - so now let's jump into the project
139:23 - portion of the video what's up guys
139:32 - how's it going let's get started or as
139:38 - this in my country
139:39 - let's get swifty so we're gonna be
139:42 - starting from complete scratch okay so
139:44 - if you look at over onto the screen cue
139:47 - that screen up right now it's empty okay
139:51 - but this is what we want it to look like
139:53 - ultimately so challenge one challenge
139:56 - two three four five blackjack blah blah
139:59 - we're gonna start off a challenge one in
140:02 - this video Ken we're just gonna work and
140:04 - figure out how to actually do that so
140:09 - let's get started on this challenge okay
140:11 - the first thing we're gonna need to do
140:13 - is sew so by the way the reason why I
140:16 - have the borders around it and so you
140:18 - can kind of see like visually you know
140:20 - once we're actually working on this
140:21 - challenge you'll you'll see how you know
140:24 - each border is supposed to represent
140:26 - like a div or a container and if you
140:29 - don't know what the heck that is don't
140:31 - worry you'll learn and I'll guide you
140:33 - through the process okay so the first
140:36 - thing we're gonna do is just add add the
140:39 - HTML content okay so where's this
140:41 - challenge one your age and days and
140:43 - maybe the click Me button in the reset
140:45 - button and we'll go from there okay so
140:47 - let's get started on the left-hand side
140:50 - I want to show you in vs code here I
140:52 - have index.html file and right next to
140:57 - it I have a static folder and static I
140:59 - have my CSS I have my images I have my
141:02 - GS and sounds okay so don't worry about
141:05 - that for now you what you aren't gonna
141:07 - worry about is CSS and JavaScript okay
141:12 - and I don't want to just show you
141:13 - JavaScript by itself I can and I will a
141:16 - little bit here and there but my main
141:18 - goal is to show you JavaScript and how
141:19 - it works together we
141:21 - everything else okay so you know I'll
141:24 - show you a few things in JavaScript
141:25 - right now so I'll go over to my
141:28 - JavaScript and I'll write something like
141:32 - alert hello okay and I'm gonna hit save
141:37 - I'm gonna go back to my index.html file
141:39 - and I'll write my doc tab it'll
141:44 - autocomplete a bunch of useful common
141:46 - normal stuff and so I'll just keep that
141:49 - there and for document I will say let's
141:54 - see Java Script on steroids and when I
142:00 - come over here and I hit refresh the tab
142:03 - you'll see it says JavaScript on
142:04 - steroids now I need to link my
142:06 - JavaScript sheet to my HTML otherwise
142:11 - it's not gonna run the JavaScript code
142:12 - okay it's kind of like the CSS and how
142:14 - that work now on the left hand side you
142:16 - can see how they're related to each
142:18 - other okay index is over here and then
142:21 - you got to go in the static folder then
142:24 - you got to go into J's folder and then
142:25 - you got up click on it then you got to
142:28 - select J script yes so we're gonna do
142:31 - just that okay so right before the body
142:33 - tag is about to end I'm gonna add a
142:35 - script tag and I will say something
142:37 - along the lines of source and I'll make
142:41 - the source static /j s slash script
142:48 - dot J s okay I'll hit save and I'll let
142:53 - refresh and you can see that the
142:55 - JavaScript code just ran and now it says
142:58 - hello okay this alert popped up I can
143:00 - change this this to hi and I can come
143:03 - here refresh and now you can see the
143:06 - dialog box popped up and it says hi I
143:08 - can comment this out I can say console
143:13 - dot log hello and hit save I can hit
143:18 - right click inspect I'll go into console
143:20 - I'll refresh and when I hit refresh what
143:24 - you see here let's make that bigger what
143:29 - you see here it says hello okay and this
143:32 - is the console so anything I write and I
143:35 - said call
143:35 - so the log it'll just show up in the
143:37 - console right here console is very very
143:40 - useful and if you have chrome you can
143:44 - pop into this and check it out
143:46 - developer tools and I'm sure Mozilla
143:48 - Firefox has those developer tools as
143:50 - well okay but I but I encourage you to
143:52 - use Chrome because that's what we're
143:54 - gonna be using for this course so now
143:58 - let's get started and see how can we add
144:00 - this challenge one your aging days right
144:02 - we're gonna just add the HTML content
144:03 - I'm just gonna comment on someone's
144:05 - JavaScript and we'll work on the
144:07 - JavaScript part together I'm also gonna
144:09 - hide the tab by doing command B okay I'm
144:12 - gonna hide that little tab right there
144:14 - and we're gonna go into our body and
144:16 - we're gonna get started so first I'm
144:18 - gonna write an h2 tag because I think
144:20 - that's an h2 I'm gonna right click
144:21 - inspect and I'm yeah that's h2 okay so
144:26 - I'm gonna go back and my h2 tag I'm
144:30 - gonna write this so boom refresh
144:34 - challenge one your age in days so cool
144:37 - we're done with that part of the code
144:40 - now I want to add a few buttons and you
144:44 - know make them look kind of nice how
144:46 - these look so let's let's let's first
144:49 - just add a button and then the button
144:53 - will say click me and then we'll have
144:57 - another button and now say reset okay
145:02 - I'll come over here refresh and now we
145:04 - have two buttons okay cool so we got the
145:07 - buns but now what now we want to make it
145:09 - look a little bit nicer so what I'm
145:13 - gonna do is instead of designing my own
145:14 - epic buttons I'm just gonna use
145:16 - bootstrap and bootstrap makes it really
145:18 - easy to to just style my stuff and make
145:24 - it look a lot nicer okay without me
145:26 - having to write a lot of code to style
145:28 - my but I'm gonna go get bootstrap and
145:30 - just do it so here bootstrap CDN and
145:35 - quick bootstrap CDN stack path I'll grab
145:39 - this complete CSS path okay CSS I have
145:44 - copied it and I'm gonna go over here and
145:47 - I will
145:48 - say link and then paste that bootstrap
145:53 - okay now that that bootstrap has been
145:56 - pasted all this is by the way guys it
145:59 - all this is by the way is just a CSS
146:02 - file that's hosted online okay so you
146:05 - could take the CSS file and you could
146:08 - actually paste it into your own CSS file
146:11 - like like that and notice it's like many
146:14 - many many many lines of code it just is
146:18 - all horizontal and on one line but I I
146:22 - wouldn't do that I'll just use the one
146:25 - that's on line okay so I'm just gonna
146:26 - link to that path that's kind of all
146:28 - we're doing here by linking to that path
146:30 - instead of linking to a local path we're
146:32 - linking to an online path and after
146:36 - linking to it for these buttons I'm just
146:38 - gonna add the class button button
146:44 - primary for this one and now what you're
146:48 - gonna notice if I come here and hit
146:49 - refresh this looks like a beautiful
146:51 - juicy bootstrap button okay and then I'm
146:56 - for this button I'm gonna add class is
146:58 - equal to button button danger like that
147:01 - okay hit refresh and you can see now it
147:04 - looks like a nice juicy bootstrap danger
147:07 - button okay so you have the blue button
147:09 - we have the red button now what's what
147:12 - else is going on on this page right so
147:15 - on this page we have all this content
147:17 - nice and centered and whereas on arms we
147:21 - actually don't have a nice and centered
147:23 - right if I look at ours it's kind of
147:24 - like all the way to the top left a lot
147:27 - of it's like squeezed up there so we
147:29 - wanna if you notice you know we kind of
147:32 - want to bring it in the middle and give
147:35 - it a little spacing from the top so
147:36 - we're gonna do that so we're just gonna
147:40 - play around with it and see how we can
147:42 - do it okay I'm gonna put a container
147:44 - here in a second because what I want to
147:46 - do I want to show you guys something
147:47 - called flexbox okay and flexbox makes
147:51 - your life really really easy it's gonna
147:53 - allow you to put things in a nice little
147:56 - grid and organize them instead of how we
147:59 - had to do it with
148:00 - we had flex boxes you have to use like
148:03 - coordinates and percentages and do a lot
148:06 - of math to create things into their own
148:08 - grids and columns well it's flex box it
148:10 - makes it really easy to put things
148:12 - either in a row or in a column and it
148:14 - just calculates everything for you looks
148:16 - super nice and organized okay
148:18 - so that's what we're gonna do first I
148:21 - will create a container class okay I'm
148:24 - gonna say I'm gonna call this container
148:26 - one okay I have this move this over and
148:34 - now I'm gonna create a flexbox class
148:39 - okay I'm gonna give this class flexbox
148:43 - container one like that and I'm gonna
148:54 - save this guy a div and I'll add I'll
149:00 - add in this button okay and I'll just
149:07 - put each of these buttons in their own
149:08 - divs
149:21 - okay so cool so I have basically what
149:27 - I'm doing is I'm putting a flex box at
149:29 - the top and inside of it I'm putting in
149:32 - two buttons and each of those buttons is
149:35 - it's you know a in its own div okay I'm
149:38 - gonna hit refresh here and you just see
149:40 - that each button is it in its own div
149:42 - now what I want to do is put them all
149:45 - kind of in one space so before I go and
149:49 - do all of that let's just do a flexbox
149:52 - container one and I'm gonna go in here
149:57 - and I'll just add a border okay I'll add
149:59 - one pixel
150:01 - let's do solid and black come here
150:04 - refresh flexbox container one let's go
150:10 - back here why isn't it showing up Oh
150:13 - obviously because I didn't link to the
150:16 - sheet so I'm just gonna do link and I'm
150:19 - gonna do static slash CSS slash style of
150:24 - CSS refresh here and now you can see
150:27 - that it's actually showing up somewhat
150:32 - okay so we got those two divs there and
150:37 - then what I actually want to do is I
150:40 - want to say display flex okay so I'm
150:47 - doing display flex now and I'm gonna do
150:50 - flex let's add a little bit of padding
150:52 - to this okay adding a little bit of
150:58 - padding here oh and this div here let's
151:06 - move this down
151:10 - so sorry my container div wasn't closing
151:13 - although at the bottom and that's kind
151:15 - of where some of the stupid errors we're
151:16 - coming from I don't know what the heck
151:17 - I'm doing here and this Dave is supposed
151:19 - to be closing all the way at the bottom
151:21 - here cool so now what's happening is
151:24 - this Dave is being closed here this
151:26 - disclosed here this is closed here and
151:28 - this one's closed there cool
151:30 - now let's refresh okay cool so now we
151:33 - have the two buttons inside of inside of
151:36 - one container okay this is the container
151:39 - this is what I added the border around
151:41 - okay so if you notice here right I'm
151:45 - gonna hover over the elements here real
151:48 - quick I'll move this here and I'm
151:51 - hovering over the container element and
151:53 - you can see that the this element that
151:57 - says flexbox container 1 that's where
152:00 - actually that border is and that's the
152:02 - one you actually see highlighted right
152:04 - now right okay now what I want to do is
152:09 - add some padding in between the buttons
152:11 - too so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
152:13 - put each of the buttons in their own
152:15 - little box cuz right now they're part of
152:18 - one flex box so they're kind of like
152:21 - pushing together with each other so what
152:24 - I want to actually do is give them a
152:27 - little breathing room okay
152:29 - so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say
152:32 - inside of the flexbox container class
152:35 - container class if there's any div just
152:39 - give it a padding of 10 10 pixels and so
152:43 - now you see eat you because click me is
152:47 - a div and reset is a div it's giving its
152:50 - giving it its own space I can also say
152:54 - hey border add 1 pixel solid black here
153:00 - and so now you can see that the reset
153:03 - and click me are actually their own
153:05 - little thing and even though their own
153:07 - little thing to have a little padding
153:08 - inside right so if I actually take away
153:11 - the padding right I I click this you can
153:13 - see what happens or if I go in here and
153:16 - take away the padding so let's see on
153:19 - the right side if it lets me take that
153:20 - away
153:22 - click right here yep right there so if I
153:25 - take that padding away you see how those
153:27 - buttons are squeezed together like that
153:29 - but then I'm gonna add padding to get a
153:32 - little bit of breathing room so now what
153:35 - this is doing is that inside of this
153:36 - class every single div its selecting
153:41 - that and I'm just styling each of those
153:44 - divs that are that's only within this
153:46 - particular container class okay
153:51 - hopefully you're following me so far
153:53 - okay so right now we're just kind of
153:54 - doing the styling part we're gonna add
153:57 - the JavaScript part in just a little bit
154:00 - so now what do we want to do okay we
154:03 - have all of this together one thing we
154:06 - want to do is that we want to justify
154:08 - our content okay we want to justify our
154:11 - content and we want to justify it as
154:13 - space around and when we refresh it's
154:17 - adding space around it so flexbox has
154:21 - like smart things okay there are some
154:24 - other options too for example see if vs
154:27 - codes will make those suggestions for
154:29 - you so do you justify content and then
154:31 - see it does write flex start flex and so
154:34 - I can do flex start for example okay
154:36 - hit this refresh and now set flex start
154:39 - I could also do flex and and now they're
154:42 - all the way to the right of the Flex box
154:44 - right where the Flex box is ending so
154:47 - have you ever seen those testimonials on
154:48 - a page where at the bottom like some of
154:51 - them are starting from the left to right
154:52 - and then right below it it starts from
154:55 - right to left and then right the lowest
154:56 - start from left to right
154:58 - well we're using flexbox you could
155:00 - actually make it really easy for you to
155:03 - do and it's kind of cool and it will do
155:06 - flex here as well so there we go
155:11 - justified content will add a flex wrap
155:15 - flex wrap will come in handy later on
155:18 - when we have things that need to wrap
155:20 - around or go to start going to new lines
155:23 - so it won't really take too much effect
155:25 - right now but I'll show you what it does
155:29 - afterward and instead of flex and we're
155:32 - gonna
155:32 - a new space around you can also do space
155:35 - between space evenly
155:37 - cool so our dev one is looking somewhat
155:42 - decent we're gonna do a line items
155:47 - Center okay now what we want to do is
155:54 - make sure that the entire challenge is
155:57 - inside of a container so what I'm gonna
155:59 - do is I already have it inside of a
156:02 - container what I want to do is just make
156:04 - it visual so you can actually see it
156:06 - okay so I'm just gonna do dot container
156:10 - one and then I'll just do border one
156:14 - pixel solid black okay and there we go
156:19 - so now you can see that the entire thing
156:21 - is actually inside of one container and
156:26 - the this one over here is the Flex box
156:29 - inside now flex box has two flex items
156:32 - and one is click me and one is reset
156:35 - okay
156:37 - I can do you know different kinds of
156:40 - things with this like I can choose my
156:42 - Flex Direction so I can do a row which
156:47 - is usually by default and I can also do
156:49 - column and now notice that each of those
156:53 - are in its own column which again is
156:56 - pretty cool how it makes it so easy for
156:58 - you I just didn't call them I can also
157:01 - do column reverse if I wanted to switch
157:04 - their orders right and I can also do row
157:10 - reverse so here now reset and click me
157:13 - get switched up so pretty nice but right
157:18 - now we're just going to keep it at row
157:20 - now what we want to do is when somebody
157:24 - clicks click me it should essentially
157:31 - add how many days old you are okay and
157:36 - then let you reset it so we're gonna now
157:39 - work on that okay so what we're gonna do
157:43 - for this is we're gonna go inside of our
157:45 - index
157:46 - HTML we're gonna go right below our div
157:50 - flexbox container 1 we're gonna create
157:55 - another div here we're gonna give it the
157:58 - same class a flex box container 1
158:03 - because we want to inherit its styling
158:06 - and then inside of here I'm gonna create
158:09 - a div and I'll give it an idea flex box
158:14 - result okay just like that so now this
158:19 - is gonna be empty you're not this is
158:21 - gonna be empty there's nothing in there
158:23 - yet what we're gonna do is we're gonna
158:25 - create an h2 element and we're gonna add
158:27 - it in there so that's kind of where that
158:30 - is gonna take place but you're not gonna
158:33 - see that right away so let's go ahead
158:36 - and do that
158:38 - now we're gonna go to our script I will
158:42 - remove all of this and this is gonna be
158:45 - our challenge 1 your age in days now
158:51 - this is the fun JavaScript part okay
158:53 - okay how do we do age in days well think
158:57 - about it first what we need is well
159:00 - here's what we need to get okay we need
159:02 - to see how what year somebody was born
159:05 - in okay so let's say that you were born
159:08 - in 1994 well how would I figure out how
159:11 - many days old you are in a simple way
159:15 - okay I will take your age and just
159:18 - multiply it by 365 because there are 365
159:23 - days in a year and that will give me
159:26 - your age in days so if you're 10 years
159:27 - old I'll do 10 multiply it by 365 that
159:32 - number
159:32 - 3650 those will be the number of days
159:37 - and you know and that's how old you are
159:40 - and that's essentially what we're gonna
159:43 - be doing here okay you know take the age
159:45 - and then just subtract so for example I
159:49 - can do something like variable birth
159:52 - year is equal to
159:57 - 1994 whoops let's do this let's do birth
160:03 - year that's it's for 1994 now I'm gonna
160:06 - do 2018
160:07 - - birth or sorry I can do this age in
160:12 - days right what's the formula for Asian
160:14 - days well that's just 2018 the current
160:18 - year - your birth year okay
160:21 - and now if I print out aging days age in
160:27 - days it says 20 other sorry I gotta do
160:32 - this multiplied let's put a parentheses
160:37 - around this multiply it by 365 okay now
160:42 - if I do age in days
160:44 - it gives me eight thousand seven hundred
160:46 - sixty and that's how many days old I am
160:49 - so that's essentially it it's not too
160:52 - complicated it's a pretty straight up
160:53 - thing so we're gonna do birth year is
160:56 - equal to but how we're gonna now take
161:00 - this input is by using something called
161:02 - prompt okay so for example I can say
161:05 - variable
161:10 - let's see Apple okay I will say equals
161:15 - prompt how many apples do you eat every
161:21 - day question mark and now notice it just
161:26 - pulled up a prompt okay it says how many
161:29 - apples do you eat everyday I will say
161:32 - six and hit enter now that I've done
161:34 - that I'm gonna go in the console and hit
161:37 - Apple and look it says six it gives me a
161:39 - six as a string very cool okay so that's
161:43 - information that you're actually gonna
161:44 - be that's how you're gonna be taking an
161:46 - information from the user that's how
161:48 - you're gonna be using the prompt so I'm
161:50 - gonna go here and I'll say a prompt what
161:55 - year were you born good friend okay
162:03 - so let's save it let's come here let's
162:06 - refresh and boom there it is I was born
162:09 - in 1994 awesome now what we're gonna do
162:12 - is we're gonna connect that button to to
162:18 - triggering this okay so every time we
162:22 - click instead of it just like instead of
162:24 - just me refreshing the page and it
162:25 - popping up this prompt what I want to do
162:27 - is that it should pop up once I click
162:30 - the click Me button so what I'm gonna do
162:33 - is I'm gonna wrap this inside of a
162:35 - function I'll call this function age in
162:38 - days all right
162:44 - and I'll go in my index.html and what
162:52 - I'll say is that in this button I'm
162:54 - gonna give it another attribute and I'll
162:56 - say on click run that function age in
163:01 - days okay
163:04 - I said run that function so I'll hit
163:06 - refresh and now look the prompt didn't
163:08 - pop up but when I click click me the
163:10 - prompt prompts up okay pops up cool so
163:14 - that's pretty exciting so far let's keep
163:17 - going we got our birth here what can we
163:20 - do now well let's just pop up hopefully
163:23 - as post mates and we got some delicious
163:26 - food we'll see how it is it's probably
163:29 - really good and let's just keep rolling
163:32 - with it okay so I'm gonna do var all
163:34 - right so age in days okay we just did
163:37 - birth year and now we're gonna take your
163:39 - age in days okay how are we gonna do
163:41 - that I'm gonna call this age in days a
163:44 - bad variable name because the function
163:47 - is called this so I will just do age in
163:50 - days okay terrible normally shouldn't do
163:55 - that but I just will okay and I'm gonna
163:58 - move on with this so what I'm gonna do
164:00 - is I'm gonna say 2018 - birth year
164:02 - that's kind of what we did earlier x 365
164:06 - that's gonna give me the age in days
164:09 - okay of this person and let's actually
164:12 - just print it out to the console so I'm
164:14 - gonna do consult log
164:16 - age in days which is a variable here
164:19 - I'll go here I'll hit refresh now click
164:22 - click me and I'll do 1994 and in the
164:25 - console is giving me the right result
164:28 - ok 8760 the only problem is that is
164:32 - giving me in the console but it needs to
164:34 - give it to me actually in our file right
164:39 - our in our index.html so what we need to
164:42 - do is add it to that ok this is
164:45 - something called Dom do M document
164:48 - object model and we just need to create
164:50 - a new h2 element and just put it in our
164:53 - Dom okay so I'll show you exactly how
164:55 - we're gonna do that you see this little
164:57 - empty box here we're gonna just attach
164:59 - it kind of to that so let's get started
165:03 - with that I'm gonna say create an h1
165:06 - variable I'm gonna say document dot
165:08 - creates elements and I'll create a h1
165:12 - element ok now once I create that h1
165:14 - element I'm gonna say text answer
165:17 - document dot create text node ok so I'm
165:23 - now creating text and I'm gonna add that
165:26 - ultimately to the h1 content ok so I'm
165:29 - gonna say you are you are here plus age
165:38 - in days so this is what we're doing
165:40 - right now a string concatenation so
165:43 - we're taking a string and then we're
165:45 - adding a variable to it ok that's it's
165:47 - just a fancy way of saying like we're
165:49 - attaching two strings together got it
165:52 - okay good all right let's keep going so
165:55 - I'm gonna take this I will add days old
166:00 - to that okay so this is gonna create
166:05 - that text node this um pop get grabbing
166:09 - this age in days over here and that's
166:11 - gonna be my text answer once I create
166:13 - this text answer I want to add it to my
166:15 - h1 okay so how do I do that I'm gonna
166:18 - say set h1 dot set attribute and I'm
166:22 - gonna say set its ID to age in days
166:29 - and then I want to do H 1 dot
166:31 - appendchild text answer and then lastly
166:36 - what I want to do is document dot get
166:38 - element by ID flex box result okay and a
166:44 - pen child H one a lot going on here and
166:48 - I'm gonna explain it in just a second so
166:51 - I'm gonna delete all of this or that one
166:54 - line I'm gonna hit refresh
166:57 - I'll hit click me I'll hit 1994 and boom
167:00 - you can see that it says you are eight
167:02 - thousand seven or sixty days old in my
167:05 - code okay doesn't say it anywhere else
167:08 - and not in the console not in an alert
167:12 - it actually says it right in my page so
167:15 - how is this working okay I can always
167:21 - right click and hit inspect whenever
167:23 - you're in doubt just inspect okay think
167:26 - of it like you're a detective and you're
167:28 - trying to figure out like what's
167:29 - actually taking place so while I'm
167:32 - looking at this if I hover over I can
167:34 - see my agent days and another thing I
167:37 - want you to notice is you see here on
167:39 - line eight or we're setting this
167:41 - attribute and we're saying set this h1
167:43 - tags ID to age in days well check it out
167:46 - this h1 now has an ID which is age in
167:49 - days and then what I'm doing is I'm I'm
167:54 - adding that little h1 that I created
167:57 - right to that I'm appending the text
167:59 - answer I created earlier so it's adding
168:01 - this guy right here to the h1 and then
168:08 - once it does that I go grab the flexbox
168:11 - result okay which is right over here
168:14 - flexbox result and to that i append a
168:17 - child which is the h1 tag I ended up
168:20 - creating ok so if I hit refresh it goes
168:24 - away when I click me 1994 it calculates
168:27 - it for me and gives me how old I am now
168:30 - we just need to do two things one it's
168:33 - to make sure that when we hit reset this
168:37 - actually goes away okay and that one is
168:40 - not as hard so I'm going to
168:42 - do function reset and I'll say take that
168:47 - document get that particular element by
168:50 - its ID okay and ID we gave it flex box
168:53 - result that's the idea of it right so
168:55 - I'm gonna do flex box result or actually
169:00 - I'm gonna do age in days because that's
169:04 - the that's ID that this guy has so we
169:06 - want to grab that guy and remove him
169:10 - okay so I'm gonna do a get element age
169:13 - and days and I'm just gonna call remove
169:15 - on it and now I just want to make sure
169:19 - that this function reset runs when I
169:23 - click the reset button see if you can
169:27 - figure this part out because we did the
169:30 - click me together where I gave click me
169:32 - the ability to run this function age in
169:35 - days
169:36 - see if you can get the reset one to
169:38 - figure it I'm gonna give you five
169:39 - seconds five four three two one okay now
169:46 - I'm gonna show you how to do it so if
169:47 - you didn't get it
169:48 - don't worry beat yourself up just a
169:50 - little bit because you should have
169:51 - gotten it but if but if not you know
169:53 - what it's okay this happens and we're
169:56 - here to learn and we'll just figure it
169:57 - out together okay you and me okay we're
170:00 - in this battle together so let's figure
170:01 - it out I'm gonna go to my I'm gonna go
170:07 - to my button okay reset and I'm just
170:09 - gonna go here and I'll say on click and
170:11 - I will say run the function reset that's
170:15 - it so now I'll refresh I'll hit click
170:17 - meet 1994 you are eight thousand seven
170:20 - or sixty days old
170:21 - I'll hit reset and boom it just grabs
170:24 - that div and just deletes it so now it's
170:28 - gone okay if I actually remove all the
170:30 - borders you wouldn't even see anything
170:32 - here just look empty to you and the last
170:36 - thing we want to do in this challenge is
170:37 - just make sure everything is kind of
170:39 - like centralized so what I want to do is
170:41 - I will go to my style at CSS I'll go to
170:43 - my container and I'm gonna do margin:0
170:47 - auto and I'll hit refresh here and I'm
170:51 - gonna go to my width and I'll make my
170:54 - width like about seven
170:55 - five percent and I'll hit refresh and
170:58 - now you can see that it's a little bit
171:00 - more centralized right but the text is
171:03 - still not centralized so last thing I
171:06 - wanna do is a line text or I think it's
171:10 - text align text align and center I'm not
171:15 - a front-end expert guys I barely spent
171:18 - any time on front-end so take this with
171:20 - a grain of salt so take this with a
171:22 - grain of salt but this is good I'm gonna
171:24 - save it I'm gonna come here refresh look
171:27 - at that nice and centralized looking
171:30 - sexy we're ready to get into our
171:33 - challenge too I hope that you got it so
171:35 - far you understand it whether you
171:38 - understand it or you don't what I want
171:41 - you to do is try to do this all from
171:44 - scratch okay don't get discouraged
171:46 - because you're gonna fail this the first
171:48 - few times it's gonna feel a little bit
171:50 - like is gonna hurt your brain but it's
171:52 - gonna start to make sense so do this for
171:54 - your first few times get the hang of how
171:56 - that HTML the CSS and the JavaScript all
171:59 - connect and speak together of each other
172:01 - one thing is styling it one thing is
172:04 - creating it and the other thing
172:05 - JavaScript is helping speak to your code
172:09 - your buttons and make everything
172:12 - essentially work okay so that's it I
172:14 - hope you're excited for the second
172:16 - challenge I know I am and as always
172:19 - that's it for this video and I'll see
172:21 - you you in the next video what's up you
172:37 - how is it going I hope you are excited
172:41 - and I know I am and we're gonna work on
172:44 - the second challenge in this video okay
172:46 - this is the cat generator challenge and
172:49 - just gonna be super exciting a lot of
172:51 - fun to work on it this is where you hit
172:53 - that green button and it generates cats
172:56 - for you okay kind of like that and we're
172:59 - gonna work on this together we're gonna
173:00 - build it up now the things that are
173:02 - gonna be that that are gonna be like the
173:05 - most complex in this project right is
173:07 - not really the JavaScript horse
173:09 - it's gonna be the HTML and CSS portion
173:12 - so we're gonna focus more on HTML and
173:15 - CSS part of for this project and then
173:17 - the JavaScript part is gonna be a little
173:19 - bit easier and we're gonna do that at
173:20 - the end in the store we're gonna do HTML
173:22 - CSS and now you might be wondering hey
173:24 - Kazi this is the JavaScript module so
173:27 - why are we focusing more on the HTML and
173:29 - CSS the reason is because I want you to
173:32 - learn in a project-based way now I can
173:36 - just teach you the JavaScript parent we
173:38 - can just do console.log all day and not
173:40 - actually build any cool projects but
173:42 - that would be boring you're gonna want
173:45 - to shoot yourself and you're not gonna
173:47 - actually make any forward progress so I
173:49 - want to avoid that and you might
173:51 - actually make progress but it won't be
173:53 - as enjoyable and you won't feel that
173:54 - deep sense of achievement okay but I
173:57 - promise you will learn JavaScript in a
173:59 - more deeper way because you get to learn
174:01 - how it connects to these projects okay
174:03 - so it'll be a lot of fun hang in there
174:06 - with me and let's get started so for
174:08 - this let's talk about the HTML and CSS
174:11 - part okay so you saw me just generate
174:13 - five cats right now okay notice what
174:15 - happened like the cats didn't run across
174:18 - this border right they didn't run across
174:20 - to the right or to the left
174:22 - they nicely move on to the to a new line
174:26 - in this case okay so how are these how
174:29 - are these images intelligent like that
174:31 - how does that happen how does it know to
174:34 - automatically go to a new line when it
174:36 - can't fit on the top one anymore and I'm
174:39 - gonna show you some really cool ways to
174:42 - be able to make something and in a
174:44 - really super simple way the simplest way
174:46 - okay to do that okay normally it used to
174:49 - require math and for you to know
174:50 - percentages there's there's something so
174:53 - much easier so it's a little bit of how
174:56 - we did the last one the age in days
174:58 - except I'm gonna break this one down a
175:00 - little bit more okay so first I'm gonna
175:03 - just gonna take a picture of this
175:04 - challenge right here I'm just gonna
175:05 - let's just talk about this particular
175:07 - challenge and nothing else okay so let's
175:11 - go like this and talk about this
175:14 - challenge now everything that's in the
175:16 - gray area in this picture I want you to
175:18 - think of that as the body okay that's
175:21 - the body of the entire
175:23 - EML documents so for example you know
175:26 - here this white area right that's the
175:29 - body the thing in the borders like these
175:32 - over here those are the containers right
175:35 - so we made the containers and then we
175:37 - shrunk them right and we made it we made
175:39 - it like so it's more centered all the
175:42 - content is centered on the page but the
175:44 - outside of it and like every the whole
175:47 - document is actually like the body okay
175:48 - so I just want you to be aware of that
175:52 - distinction now first I want to talk
175:55 - about this okay so this is a container
176:00 - that contains everything about our
176:02 - challenge okay so it's literally just a
176:05 - div okay and that div has a class of
176:08 - container that's all this is so this red
176:12 - thing I'm just gonna call this a
176:13 - container all right now what's going on
176:17 - with the rest of the stuff right this
176:21 - this challenge thing is just in the
176:24 - container and the button we can just
176:26 - call we can just say that it's in a
176:28 - container right now I have it in its own
176:30 - div which is like a flexbox div but
176:34 - that's really not necessary and in this
176:36 - challenge we're not gonna even do that
176:37 - but you can if you want to so we're
176:40 - gonna ignore the the button but the
176:41 - button is essentially you think of it
176:43 - like it's in the same place as where the
176:44 - challenge is okay it's just in the
176:46 - container that's it and now where are
176:49 - these cats right these cats are actually
176:52 - inside of a something we call in CSS a
176:56 - flexbox so they're actually inside of
177:00 - another div okay so I'm gonna highlight
177:03 - this blue and I'm gonna make a little
177:07 - bit tricky but I'm gonna do this like
177:10 - this and then I'm gonna move this oops
177:14 - when it moves this blue bar right on top
177:17 - of this okay I should be good enough
177:21 - okay so that blue box is another day of
177:25 - inside of the container div okay so the
177:27 - container is the parent and this blue
177:29 - one is not the parent okay it's the
177:31 - child and this is the Flex box
177:33 - div okay
177:36 - within this flexbox day if we have a few
177:39 - items now flexbox is something that's
177:41 - pretty intelligent and it has pretty
177:45 - smart built-in ways of telling it to hey
177:49 - space things evenly or when something
177:52 - runs across make sure it does make sure
177:54 - it doesn't run across instead it
177:55 - actually runs down below and starts a
177:58 - new line okay so what we're gonna talk
178:01 - about that too and all these the images
178:04 - they're just image elements okay so if I
178:06 - have to highlight them I'll highlight
178:08 - them for you as well so these each of
178:12 - these are just image elements that's it
178:15 - okay so if I have to write that down I
178:20 - would just write IMG here and that's it
178:22 - it's just the image class or the image
178:25 - element that's all those are now where
178:30 - this padding thing is coming from right
178:32 - like how is there this spacing that
178:35 - takes place in between so if I have to
178:37 - draw this out how is this happening so
178:42 - here I'm gonna type this out because my
178:49 - handwriting is not the best okay this 10
178:53 - pixel margin where is that taking place
178:55 - that's actually taking place in the Flex
178:58 - box so in the flex box styling we can
179:01 - actually define it to to just space all
179:05 - of the that divs items by 10 pixels so
179:09 - that's essentially what's causing that
179:11 - spacing okay now what is causing it to
179:17 - wrap instead of going across the body
179:20 - and running into the body right and
179:23 - getting outside of the flex box div or
179:25 - the original container the reason why
179:29 - when you pop open a new image it goes
179:31 - down below is because of something
179:34 - called wrapping and flex box and there's
179:35 - an intelligent way how wrapping works so
179:39 - here I'm gonna just highlight it and
179:43 - essentially the code we have for that
179:45 - flex wrap
179:47 - rap okay so that's the specific code
179:51 - that's actually making the wrapping work
179:53 - and another thing I want you to be aware
179:57 - of is how there is uh how everything is
180:01 - spaced kind of evenly and then there's
180:05 - space around it okay so notice notice
180:11 - here right this is not just that ten
180:15 - padding this is something else
180:21 - okay and then notice this here and
180:25 - notice this here right how is that so
180:28 - this is actually something we call space
180:36 - around okay and space around is what's
180:42 - causing this to happen and more
180:44 - specifically the code the line of code
180:47 - would be this so let me sorry I'm sorry
180:50 - let me delete this and then right in
180:52 - here if it would let me just TIFF by
181:00 - content space around okay like that so
181:07 - that's actually what's allowing me to
181:09 - have that equal spacing take place okay
181:12 - so at the end of the day we have two
181:15 - divs one is the container div and then
181:17 - the one is a flexbox div flexbox div
181:20 - it's intelligent we just tell it hey
181:23 - make it all the items of that div flex
181:25 - so all the link that basically somebody
181:28 - put together this website where it's
181:31 - called a cat API comm and every time you
181:34 - run their URL it gets you a new image
181:37 - every single time and some random new
181:40 - image so I thought that'd be that'd be
181:42 - cool and it makes our life a lot easier
181:44 - okay so if I you know paste that every
181:49 - time and run it you can see I keep
181:52 - getting a new newer and newer image and
181:55 - also because I want a small image in the
181:58 - arguments of the URL parameter Isis size
182:00 - is equal to
182:01 - small okay and type is jiff now you
182:04 - could probably change the type you could
182:06 - probably change the source and you could
182:08 - probably change the size but I like
182:10 - small and I like jiff because gifs are
182:13 - awesome so let's go back to our
182:17 - JavaScript steroids thing and I'm just
182:20 - gonna paste that I'm just gonna paste it
182:24 - that's it okay I'm just gonna paste it
182:26 - as a source and we're gonna hit refresh
182:28 - and you can see one of the images
182:31 - popping up in the Flex box right it's
182:34 - popping up in the Flex box let's try
182:39 - putting another image in another image
182:41 - and then refreshing and seeing what
182:45 - happens so now what I want you to notice
182:48 - is that these images are really close to
182:51 - each other and there's no padding right
182:53 - so if I put this to the left-hand side
182:57 - whoops if I put this is a left-hand side
183:00 - you see that this has padding except our
183:03 - images on the right have absolutely no
183:04 - padding and then another thing I want
183:07 - you to see is that it actually runs
183:08 - across instead of running on a new line
183:13 - right so if I added another image here
183:16 - it'll kind of look really ugly now I
183:19 - press refresh like notice that the
183:22 - images are now just literally running
183:24 - across right running across the page
183:26 - already fresh again same thing those are
183:29 - running across so now what should I do
183:33 - well first let's just highlight each
183:37 - image green so you can actually see that
183:39 - each of the elements inside of that
183:42 - flexbox
183:43 - okay or inside of that container so I'm
183:45 - gonna say flexbox container two and I'll
183:51 - go here and I'll say get select the
183:52 - image okay so I can go one level down
183:57 - that container and just select the image
183:59 - and I'm gonna give border and I'll say
184:05 - one pixel solid and also in green okay
184:08 - and we'll refresh and now you can see
184:11 - that each image has a green border
184:14 - around
184:15 - so you can kind of see you can kind of
184:18 - see what that like which part of that is
184:20 - in the image okay so yeah it's a little
184:23 - confusing cuz there's overlap between
184:25 - the Flex box and the image but I think I
184:27 - think you get the idea right okay so now
184:31 - how can we make it so the images
184:33 - actually run across or sorry run down
184:38 - okay so first let's do that so make sure
184:40 - the image is actually running down so my
184:43 - container the type is flex and then what
184:46 - I want to do is I want to say flex wrap
184:49 - and enable the wrap and when I hit
184:52 - refresh you'll notice that now when it's
184:54 - about to run across the div or the Flex
184:58 - box it'll automatically go to the new
185:00 - line so now that's a pretty good sign
185:02 - that's a pretty good thing that we have
185:04 - done but if we look at the padding the
185:07 - padding is still kind of annoying and
185:09 - also spaces it kind of weirdly right
185:12 - it's it's all left justified and it's
185:15 - not centralized and it doesn't feel like
185:17 - equal amount of spacing and it kind of
185:19 - feels a little a little messy right so
185:21 - if I fullscreen the page it looks like
185:24 - this and maybe if I put a few more cats
185:27 - here and now if I fullscreen the page
185:32 - yeah you know I'm not a really big fan
185:34 - of it so one thing we want to do
185:37 - definitely is add some padding let's try
185:40 - adding some padding here okay so now
185:47 - this is a little bit better that's maybe
185:49 - what we want most of because we
185:52 - definitely want some padding to be
185:56 - taking place right and what we're
185:59 - essentially doing is between each image
186:01 - we're adding some padding so that's what
186:03 - we're doing before we had the padding in
186:06 - the div but well we s actually won the
186:08 - padding in is between each image element
186:10 - so now between each image element it has
186:13 - a padding of 10 so this has a padding of
186:15 - 10 and this has a padding of 10 that's
186:17 - why they're kind of equally spaced
186:20 - they're spaced out from one another now
186:25 - notice how these images like the images
186:28 - below
186:28 - are lining up to the images at the top
186:30 - but notice how what we had on this page
186:35 - these images at the bottom are not
186:37 - actually lining up to the images at the
186:39 - top right they're not left justified
186:41 - they're more like centralized in a
186:44 - really intelligent way so to do that
186:47 - what we essentially need to do is said
186:50 - justify content and we want to say space
186:53 - around okay and once I hit refresh you
186:57 - can see that because of space around the
187:00 - lot the images at the bottom don't
187:02 - actually run all the way to the left
187:04 - they're more they're more centralized
187:08 - okay
187:10 - cool so flex boxes are pretty awesome
187:12 - and they make our life you know a lot a
187:15 - lot easier so we've added the padding we
187:18 - have the images we pretty much have
187:21 - everything we need at this point right
187:23 - this is the challenge is essentially
187:26 - complete at this point the only thing
187:28 - that we need to do is make it so that
187:30 - when we hit the generate cat button it
187:33 - automatically creates the image element
187:35 - right instead of us having right now
187:37 - we're manually writing it so what we
187:39 - want to do is we hit the generate cat
187:41 - button it automatically adds those cats
187:43 - so I want to do generate cat add the
187:46 - cats for me so I'm gonna go here and I'm
187:49 - gonna delete all the cats for now okay
187:51 - once I delete all the cats you can see
187:54 - that the cats are gone if I make the
187:57 - page full and I hit generate cat because
188:00 - I don't have any JavaScript attached yet
188:02 - to my page well nothing is gonna
188:05 - actually take place right nothing is
188:07 - gonna happen nothing is gonna get added
188:10 - so now we need to do a little bit of
188:13 - JavaScript magic okay but that part is
188:16 - actually very very very simple so what
188:19 - we want to do is I'm gonna go here and
188:21 - I'll say I'll give this an ID okay so
188:25 - I'll just call it cat Jen button okay
188:28 - you can really call it whatever you want
188:30 - again let me just see what I have here
188:32 - so the the naming convention is the same
188:37 - we'll actually call this cat generator
188:42 - right here okay we'll call it cat
188:45 - generator so that's the ID of this green
188:48 - button here and then I'm gonna go over
188:51 - here and I'll add something called on
188:53 - click and I'll say on click run a
188:55 - function called generate cat now I'm
189:01 - gonna go over to my JavaScript and in my
189:05 - JavaScript I'm gonna create a function
189:07 - call generate cat and what this is
189:12 - essentially gonna do is it's gonna first
189:15 - get that is gonna create an image
189:19 - element then I want to create a div
189:26 - element so I'm gonna say or actually we
189:28 - don't need to create a div element but
189:30 - what I do need to do is get access to
189:32 - the flexbox TIFF okay so I'm gonna do
189:34 - this and I'm gonna say get element by ID
189:38 - so what I need access to is actually
189:43 - this guy right over here and the idea is
189:47 - that once I can get access to this
189:49 - container I want to just keep appending
189:51 - image elements to this every time
189:53 - somebody clicks a button so to get
189:56 - access to this let's just give it an ID
189:59 - so that way it'll make it'll make
190:01 - getting access to this a little bit
190:04 - easier okay so I'm gonna say ID is equal
190:06 - to flex box or flex cat Gen that's the
190:12 - ID I'm gonna give it let's go over to
190:14 - our JavaScript I will say Flex box or
190:20 - Flex cat Gen and that should get us that
190:25 - div and now what I want to do is set the
190:29 - images source okay so the image element
190:31 - that I created earlier I want to set its
190:33 - source to a link and that link in this
190:36 - case will be the cat whatever link and
190:41 - then what I want to do at the end is to
190:44 - that div append a child and that child
190:47 - is going to be the image and save I'll
190:51 - hit refresh and I'll hit generate cats
190:54 - and boom it works and generate cat and
190:57 - it works and generate cat and generate
190:58 - cat and if i refresh you can see how
191:01 - it's working cool there's only one thing
191:04 - that we actually need to add and we're
191:07 - gonna do that in just a second okay so
191:08 - the box shadows are not there notice
191:10 - with my cat it looks a little it looks
191:12 - pretty clean right you see that how the
191:14 - image looks like it's like popping out a
191:16 - little bit that's what I want to give
191:18 - you because otherwise you're gonna have
191:20 - a image that looks really flat and your
191:22 - website looks pretty stupid and
191:26 - amateurish right you want to give it a
191:28 - little pizzazz to it so I'm gonna just
191:31 - pretty much have you copy my code here
191:33 - for that and what we're gonna do is I'm
191:37 - gonna copy my box shadow code and you
191:41 - can play around with it so you can
191:42 - really see how it works but there are
191:45 - websites like CSS Matic or something I
191:48 - think and you can go to them and
191:50 - actually create boxes and shadows and
191:53 - things like that like visually and it
191:57 - gives you the CSS code for it alright so
192:00 - I'm gonna go in image here I'll paste it
192:03 - here and where it will refresh and
192:08 - generate cat generate cat and generate
192:10 - cat and you know it looks like the Box
192:16 - shadow is popping up over here and it
192:19 - looks like that part of it is looking
192:20 - pretty good now another thing I want to
192:23 - do when I hit refresh take that away
192:31 - okay so I don't actually even need
192:34 - padding because that padding was adding
192:36 - the white border around and actually
192:39 - didn't make it look that good but with
192:41 - the space even or the space or round
192:44 - that we did with the Flex box it
192:45 - automatically gives it a inherent
192:47 - padding and that kind of looks really
192:49 - nice right now and that's essentially
192:52 - what we want so it's looking pretty good
192:55 - honestly at this point a few things we
192:59 - need we can actually improve here is
193:01 - first of all we can take away the
193:03 - borders because they look a little ugly
193:05 - the only reason I had them is so
193:08 - you can kind of compare them with the
193:10 - little picture that I made but I would
193:14 - pretty much take away like let's say at
193:16 - least that border and then the red
193:19 - borders I have right maybe just make
193:21 - them black for now ultimately you don't
193:23 - want to have any borders the reason why
193:25 - I have the borders there right now is so
193:27 - you can see very easily like what is
193:29 - what
193:30 - okay so I'll refresh and I just made the
193:33 - borders black so this way just looks a
193:35 - little bit cleaner now you might notice
193:41 - that there is there's a lot of like
193:45 - repetition of code okay so what I mean
193:48 - by that we have display flex and 4 flex
193:53 - box container one I have display flex I
193:55 - have flex wrap wrap I have for this
193:58 - flexbox container one flex wrap wrap
194:00 - flex direction row by default flex
194:03 - direction is row I only just chose to
194:05 - write it here so you can see you know
194:08 - what it actually is and then we also
194:09 - have justified content space or round
194:12 - and then I have border one pixel black
194:14 - and I have a border one pixel black so
194:16 - there since there's so much overlap of
194:17 - the code there's really no reason to
194:20 - write its own like write these lines
194:22 - again what I can actually just do is say
194:25 - flex box container to okay like that and
194:30 - just hit save and delete this and when I
194:35 - come over here refresh and hit generate
194:37 - cat you see it it generates my cats and
194:41 - my cats look pretty good
194:45 - okay so that's the situation with that
194:48 - guy container to border one pixel solid
194:53 - with 75% can and you can see like the
194:57 - code is the exact same as container one
194:59 - so what can you do right you just the
195:01 - same thing it'll do container dot
195:05 - container to
195:10 - okay so essentially the same code is
195:12 - there okay
195:15 - and you can see that that's also working
195:20 - just fine all right so now when I do
195:23 - generate cat right it almost it's still
195:26 - good
195:27 - but here's the thing one thing that
195:29 - makes it look a little ugly is like look
195:31 - there's no there's no padding or margin
195:35 - between those images it's if there's no
195:37 - breathing room for them images whereas
195:38 - if you look my look at my final version
195:41 - right look at the images and look how
195:43 - there's this nice little margin between
195:47 - the images so we're gonna basically add
195:49 - that and here you're also gonna get to
195:53 - play around with the difference of
195:54 - padding and margin okay a lot of the
195:56 - times you want to just be using margin
195:59 - but sometimes you should use padding
196:02 - generally I like to actually use margin
196:04 - so here like you'll notice what happens
196:07 - I'll do 10 p-m pixels here right I'll to
196:10 - that image I'm gonna add a padding here
196:12 - and I'll refresh and you'll notice how
196:16 - it's adding the little white thing
196:19 - because essentially what it's doing is
196:21 - extending it out but what we want to do
196:24 - is we want to give a gap between each
196:26 - image element so now instead of adding
196:30 - padding I'll say margin and I'll go
196:33 - refresh and I'll do generate cat a few
196:35 - times and boom look at that instead of
196:38 - like extending each image box what it
196:41 - did is it just added spacing between
196:44 - each image box okay
196:46 - so now this looks super clean I love it
196:52 - I hope you love it and you can see the
196:53 - power of flex boxes right the more I hit
196:56 - generate cats the the container grows to
196:59 - fit it the flex box grows to fix it to
197:03 - fit it and then the Flex box is also
197:05 - very intelligent in terms of how to
197:06 - wraps how it spaces around evenly how it
197:10 - centralizes it so I am a big fan I love
197:14 - it and there you have it this is what
197:16 - your CSS actually should look like okay
197:18 - these were the new things that we added
197:21 - literally like
197:22 - and I believe this line here okay that
197:25 - was all that was added in the CSS for
197:27 - this one or actually in container 2 this
197:30 - is all we added in the JavaScript part
197:32 - for this video and this is the only part
197:37 - that we added for the HTML part in this
197:41 - video ok that's it I hope that you
197:45 - enjoyed it I hope that you loved it this
