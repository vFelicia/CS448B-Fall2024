00:00 - hey what is up you guys it's david here
00:02 - from cleverprogrammer.com and today we
00:04 - are going to be talking about the
00:06 - 10 most useful and best extensions for
00:10 - vs code that you can possibly download
00:13 - today
00:13 - to make you more productive and make you
00:16 - a better developer
00:18 - before we get started i want you to go
00:19 - ahead and smash that like button for the
00:21 - youtube algorithm
00:22 - comment down below what you want me to
00:25 - go ahead and make a video on about next
00:28 - and i also want you to go ahead and
00:30 - check that link down below it is
00:32 - actually directing you to profit with
00:34 - javascript
00:34 - our number one course and probably the
00:37 - best javascript and react.js developer
00:40 - communities out there
00:42 - we have so many uh people who land their
00:44 - jobs at
00:45 - big companies such as paypal so i
00:47 - definitely want you to go ahead check it
00:49 - out
00:49 - and with that said let's roll that intro
01:07 - [Applause]
01:09 - all right so let's get started and let's
01:11 - take a look at what we have here
01:12 - and what kind of extensions am i talking
01:14 - about that will make you a better
01:16 - developer
01:17 - so the first one is actually auto close
01:20 - tag so before we actually get started
01:22 - this is a simple react
01:25 - js project i just ran a create react app
01:28 - in a dummy folder i think i even called
01:30 - this one
01:31 - react dummy yeah that's right and
01:35 - so this is only for demonstration
01:37 - purposes i'm not going to use this uh
01:41 - in any live project but yeah i just made
01:44 - it so i can demonstrate all the stuff
01:46 - that i will be talking about today
01:48 - all right so the first one is actually
01:51 - auto close
01:52 - tag now this one is pretty
01:54 - self-explanatory
01:56 - now this one is actually explains itself
01:58 - so let's take a look at how it works so
02:00 - if i
02:01 - uh make a little space over here
02:04 - and i just open up a h1 tag and notice
02:07 - that the moment
02:08 - i close it it closes the tag immediately
02:13 - uh so that's pretty much our first one
02:17 - super helpful you will never ever forget
02:20 - ever again
02:21 - uh to forget any kind of html attacks it
02:24 - just saves you a ton of time
02:26 - and you will just not be worried about
02:28 - like okay why is my
02:30 - react app not working why is it not
02:32 - showing up the way i want it to
02:34 - because auto close tag is actually going
02:37 - to take care of it
02:38 - all right so the next one is actually i
02:40 - still counted it as
02:41 - number one uh this pretty much ties into
02:45 - the auto close tag and all these html uh
02:48 - helper stuff
02:49 - this is auto rename text so let's go
02:51 - back to our app.js
02:53 - and remember i have the h1 and say
02:56 - i don't even want that h1 anymore i want
02:59 - a p
03:00 - tag instead so i will just go ahead
03:01 - delete and notice
03:03 - immediately deleted that one as i go
03:07 - and now i have empty tags and i can just
03:09 - type in p
03:10 - or whatever i want to so if i want a
03:13 - table
03:13 - instead i can have it and notice that
03:17 - once i
03:17 - start typing in the class name it's not
03:20 - going to do that so it's super helpful
03:22 - again saves you a ton of time you don't
03:24 - have to worry about uh
03:26 - what's gonna happen it takes care of it
03:29 - for you
03:30 - all right so number two is actually
03:32 - bracket
03:33 - pair colorizer now this one is
03:37 - again going to help you uh not to miss
03:40 - out on anything
03:41 - and this is actually just going to
03:44 - mark your brackets with the same color
03:47 - so you can take
03:48 - you can go ahead and start uh taking a
03:50 - look at what's going on here so now this
03:52 - right over here you have a purple one
03:54 - which actually
03:55 - gets closed right away another purple
03:57 - one which is going to be closed over
03:59 - here it
04:00 - also actually highlights how long that
04:02 - bracket
04:03 - uh is so super helpful once again let's
04:06 - take a look at how it works
04:08 - so right now i'm just going to go in and
04:11 - type in
04:12 - use effect boom and
04:15 - i will actually create a little bit of
04:17 - space over here which is good
04:19 - so notice that i have this purple one
04:23 - which closes over here
04:24 - and actually it marks everything for me
04:27 - so i don't have to worry about
04:29 - not closing a bracket anymore because if
04:31 - i
04:32 - in case i delete this one obviously my
04:35 - app is going to freak out and it's not
04:37 - going to know what i will be
04:38 - what i'm doing but i know that
04:41 - something is off i don't have one of
04:44 - these closed so
04:46 - let's go ahead and close it and
04:47 - everything is fixed so
04:49 - simple as that super helpful i highly
04:51 - highly recommend everybody goes ahead
04:53 - and downloads this one all right
04:54 - number three is actually prettier
04:58 - this is a code formatter that we here at
05:01 - cleverprogrammer use
05:02 - a ton we recommended everybody to go
05:05 - ahead and and set it up
05:07 - work with it play with it and just uh
05:10 - just work with all the indentation stuff
05:13 - it saves
05:14 - again a ton of time for you it just
05:16 - makes your code
05:18 - uh easily readable so if i remove the
05:21 - space that i put in here
05:22 - so now i you see i have all this
05:25 - indentation
05:26 - uh correctly but if i go ahead and mess
05:28 - it up and just fix it
05:30 - boom it actually works perfectly i can
05:32 - also set it to trigger once i save my
05:34 - file and i actually have it
05:36 - set up in a way that once i unfocus the
05:39 - window
05:40 - it actually saves it so i will have it
05:43 - immediately auto saved
05:44 - and also my code will be formatted so
05:47 - that's
05:48 - probably the best way that you can go
05:50 - ahead and work with
05:52 - vs code it actually saved me a ton of
05:54 - time so let's go ahead and take a look
05:56 - at
05:56 - the next one all right number four
05:59 - is es7 react redux graphql react native
06:04 - snippets this is
06:05 - it over here take a look at it and go
06:07 - ahead download it
06:09 - this saves me so much
06:12 - time i can't express how
06:15 - useful it is go ahead download it and
06:18 - start messing with it
06:20 - so let's say i don't i want to create a
06:23 - new component so i will go ahead and
06:26 - add a component.js file
06:29 - now i have a empty file i want to
06:33 - have a react component but every time i
06:35 - want to do it
06:36 - i would have to type in so many lines of
06:38 - code just to have a working component
06:40 - i obviously don't want to do that so
06:42 - instead i'll just type in
06:44 - rafc e which will actually create a
06:47 - react arrow function export component
06:50 - boom that's it simple as that
06:53 - i can also do it with the redux slice
06:57 - so i will just type in rx slice
07:01 - so many like i saved myself a headache
07:05 - not typing 18 lines of code
07:08 - instead i just typed in a few letters
07:11 - and hit return boom that's it super
07:14 - helpful i think it speaks for itself why
07:16 - it is
07:17 - so helpful number five get lens
07:21 - get lens is yeah get super charged but
07:23 - it gives you a nice little
07:25 - overview of what is happening inside of
07:28 - your application
07:29 - helps you identify uh what kind of code
07:32 - did you
07:33 - move around and what happened so if i
07:35 - add a h1 clever programmer in here
07:38 - and another return i can go ahead and
07:41 - compare these two codes and i see that i
07:43 - added these three lines
07:45 - obviously i can move back in time can do
07:48 - all these kind of sort of stuff
07:49 - so it is super amazing to have this
07:51 - thing and
07:53 - i can also if i go back in here i know
07:55 - that
07:56 - i can highlight this and i know that i
07:58 - made these changes
07:59 - what's happening uh what what i did and
08:03 - also here if i made the commit i know
08:06 - that i made it
08:07 - four days ago on the 28th of january
08:10 - and it was called initials pro
08:12 - initialize project using create react
08:14 - app
08:15 - super helpful once again helps you
08:17 - identify what was happening and when
08:20 - so highly recommend once again go ahead
08:22 - and download it
08:23 - on to the next one number six import
08:26 - cost
08:27 - import cost actually helps you how much
08:30 - stuff did you import
08:32 - into your project so if i were to say go
08:35 - ahead and
08:36 - add material ui and then
08:39 - import the button and then actually use
08:42 - it in the project then it would tell me
08:44 - that
08:44 - i am using an extra 73.9 kilobytes
08:49 - in the node modules so that's just a
08:51 - nice to have a nice to know
08:54 - and if you are like really on the
08:57 - optimization side of things it is
08:59 - actually
09:00 - really helpful as you know that how much
09:02 - uh storage your application is going to
09:04 - cost
09:04 - all right moving on to number seven
09:08 - live server this is actually
09:11 - probably going to be only used by
09:15 - people who are working with plain html
09:18 - css and javascript files this is super
09:21 - beginner friendly and makes your
09:23 - job so much easier by just firing up a
09:26 - live server
09:27 - and enabling live review and live reload
09:30 - and hot reloading inside of your browser
09:33 - and that way you can just go ahead save
09:35 - the file and
09:37 - just like here just like over here i am
09:40 - live
09:40 - boom it actually changed it uh changed
09:42 - it immediately
09:43 - so super helpful makes your life so much
09:47 - easier
09:47 - so make sure to go ahead check it out
09:49 - and use it moving on to number eight
09:52 - this is a collaboration application uh
09:56 - especially nowadays when everybody is
09:58 - working from home
09:59 - super helpful to have something that you
10:01 - that helps you
10:02 - work with your teammates or a co-worker
10:05 - or somebody
10:06 - and actually give them access to run to
10:10 - type code in your machine
10:12 - run stuff in your terminal and that way
10:14 - you guys can work together debug stuff
10:16 - build stuff together
10:18 - something like that this is something
10:19 - that we use a ton inside of clever
10:22 - programmer
10:22 - so again highly highly recommend going
10:25 - ahead and downloading it
10:27 - and actually this is the one that we
10:28 - used uh during live streams so once
10:32 - again
10:32 - an amazing tool go ahead use it
10:35 - sometimes it actually can be
10:36 - super buggy because it's a microsoft
10:39 - product you're kind of used to that
10:41 - anyways helps you a ton saves you so
10:44 - much time
10:45 - number nine air lens
10:48 - this one is by far probably
10:52 - one of my favorites this one actually
10:55 - detects if you make a mistake
10:57 - i did not close this button tag
11:01 - it already tells me that yo something's
11:04 - up
11:04 - and and highlights a row might not tell
11:07 - you exactly what's up
11:09 - but it definitely helps you a ton when
11:12 - you're debugging
11:13 - definitely once again probably one of my
11:15 - favorite ones just because
11:17 - it just highlights and it just doesn't
11:19 - let you make
11:20 - uh syntactical mistakes so super helpful
11:23 - once again
11:24 - especially for beginners this is going
11:27 - to save you
11:28 - so much time and so much pain and you
11:30 - will actually enjoy
11:32 - programming a ton more number 10
11:36 - react native tools this is a little more
11:39 - advanced stuff but this actually helps
11:42 - you
11:42 - uh create react native apps i use it a
11:46 - lot when i'm working with react native
11:48 - makes it easier for you to to write
11:51 - react native applications and it just
11:53 - helps you a lot
11:54 - all right i actually have two more
11:55 - bonuses just because 10
11:57 - wasn't enough let's take a look at those
11:59 - all right bonus number one
12:02 - is firebase snippets we all use firebase
12:05 - we love firebase
12:07 - but sometimes it just so good to have a
12:10 - few different snippets that
12:11 - we can actually go ahead and take take
12:14 - advantage of and i just don't have to
12:16 - type out all the code and bonus number
12:18 - two because i'm an
12:20 - apple junkie i kind of hate how we as
12:22 - code looks so i just
12:24 - installed this xcode 12 theme so if you
12:26 - are a apple junkie just like me you will
12:28 - appreciate this a lot
12:30 - if you guys are not that much of an
12:32 - apple junkies you don't have to worry
12:33 - about this
12:34 - any at all this is just a nice little
12:37 - theme that i use
12:38 - and i actually like the colors much more
12:41 - i think these are more more vibrant and
12:43 - they just make me
12:44 - so much more happy unlike the original
12:47 - colors of bs code which are kind of
12:49 - boring
12:49 - and matte and i just don't like them
12:52 - these are so much nicer colors alright
12:53 - so there you have it
12:55 - the 10 actually 12 best extensions that
