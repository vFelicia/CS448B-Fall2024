00:05 - with my host or my good friend today
00:07 - Brian yes Brian runs a company called
00:12 - CrossFit illumine and before we get into
00:14 - the company and we talk about it I want
00:16 - to talk about how you will benefit from
00:18 - this video okay so as a software
00:21 - developer or whatever you're doing if
00:23 - you're an entrepreneur or intrapreneur
00:25 - right and you want to either get a
00:28 - full-time job okay or you want to become
00:31 - a freelancer and kind of run your own
00:32 - business or you want to become an
00:34 - entrepreneur and kind of start or kind
00:36 - of start a real business a lot of the
00:38 - things we will talk about are gonna be
00:40 - very strategic and very very tactical so
00:43 - basically a lot of advice you'll be able
00:45 - to apply to a lot of those things okay
00:47 - and in this video we're just gonna kind
00:50 - of have a free-flowing conversation cuz
00:52 - a lot of the things we were talking
00:53 - about you know I started connecting with
00:54 - him recently he was my coach when he
00:57 - came to fitness and just incredible guy
01:01 - and he was just offering me so much
01:03 - value and like insight into a lot of
01:05 - things in life and in business and so
01:07 - when I came to Chicago I'm in Chicago
01:09 - right now my hometown I decided to drop
01:11 - by and speak and just a little bit about
01:15 - Brian you know he started you started
01:18 - CrossFit illumine in 2011 you said 2012
01:21 - yeah in eleven twelve yeah okay cool so
01:24 - you know he started then took it from a
01:26 - 1,700 square feet like little place to a
01:30 - 17,000 square feet is that right 7 2002
01:35 - and it grew from almost nobody to having
01:40 - 350 members at this point right yeah and
01:43 - how many people do you have on your
01:44 - staff at this point so we have a lot we
01:46 - have about 25 in total part-time
01:48 - full-time all that right okay perfect
01:51 - and what's incredible about him and this
01:55 - company and CrossFit is that it's not
01:58 - just about fitness but a lot of like
02:00 - mental mastery as well yeah and this gym
02:04 - when I was going to it honestly none of
02:07 - the gyms I've ever been to ever felt
02:08 - like this it kind of feels like a family
02:11 - when I was here it's like everybody
02:14 - when I was working out and doing
02:15 - Crossfit I was a member here four and a
02:17 - half years ago and I see you guys you
02:20 - guys went to like dinners together you
02:23 - know and a lot of these people when you
02:25 - post about it on Facebook a lot of them
02:26 - are just like volunteer to come and help
02:28 - you yeah right it's like set up set of
02:30 - the stuff right and you don't get to run
02:33 - a business like that unless you truly
02:35 - care about other people and bring them
02:37 - incredible value and incredible results
02:39 - and brian has been able to do that and
02:41 - he likes to call himself like the
02:43 - connector of dots which is which is
02:45 - pretty cool and basically he thinks in
02:48 - the clouds at high level and he brings
02:49 - these people together and he's the one
02:52 - who comes up kind of a division and then
02:54 - you know he worked for this team to
02:56 - realize it and you know a lot of the
02:59 - work we're gonna be talking about it's
03:00 - gonna be based on understanding yourself
03:02 - self discipline self mastery and
03:05 - understanding yourself and understanding
03:07 - everybody else around you so does that
03:10 - do a little bit of justice it does yeah
03:12 - yeah it's a good overview but yeah it's
03:15 - so much more than a gym yeah so much
03:18 - more than about fitness right we say
03:21 - it's an enlightened approach to human
03:22 - being so mind body and soul ready you
03:26 - have to nurture all three and we help
03:28 - with that that's epic yeah that's yeah
03:31 - so I'm excited man it's uh we were able
03:34 - to connect about what three weeks ago
03:36 - now yeah a reconnect I'll call it
03:38 - reconnect but yeah we've had some deep
03:41 - deep facebook messenger conversations
03:43 - really crazy and it's it's amazing man
03:46 - you keep you don't connect at that level
03:49 - with everybody yeah and not everybody's
03:51 - ready to hear a message which might be
03:55 - written off as you know motivational
03:57 - crap right yes not a lot of people are
04:00 - ready to hear it I definitely feel that
04:03 - and once you grow your business to like
04:06 - a certain level or you're working on
04:09 - building a business I feel like you
04:12 - become very kind of what we were talking
04:13 - about you feel very isolated yeah cuz
04:16 - your problems are very different from
04:19 - what a lot of other people's problems
04:20 - are right for example
04:23 - maybe somebody who is trying to get a
04:25 - job their problem is to like make X
04:28 - amount of money or to get promoted to
04:30 - the next level in the next level and get
04:33 - like more and more years of experience
04:34 - yeah but if you're an entrepreneur
04:37 - you're growing a business
04:39 - once you hit those revenue marks where
04:42 - you have enough for yourself where you
04:44 - have enough for your family it's not
04:48 - just about like the money or anything
04:50 - anymore
04:51 - but it's like kind of about providing
04:52 - that value to other people but also it
04:57 - being in line with what you want to do
04:58 - ultimately yeah so when you get that
05:00 - time to think for yourself and reflect
05:03 - like is this really in line with what I
05:05 - want to be doing like 10 20 30 60 or 70
05:08 - years from now yeah and it's really
05:10 - scary when sometimes the answer is no
05:13 - yeah it's very scary but it's necessary
05:16 - to be introspective frequently yeah
05:20 - because you could get too far down a
05:22 - path and maybe trap yourself or you know
05:28 - or worse right yeah so you know Harvard
05:31 - actually has a study called the
05:32 - happiness index Wow pending on where you
05:34 - live you know California is different in
05:37 - Chicago different in New York there's a
05:39 - number that you know let's say Chicago
05:41 - is 70 grand beyond 70 grand you're able
05:45 - to take care of all the necessities of
05:47 - life some luxuries you can buy a house a
05:49 - car go out to dinner and feel safe right
05:52 - it's basically safety anything above
05:54 - that or beyond that doesn't get you any
05:56 - more happiness Wow so gives you more
05:58 - things which maybe could cause you to be
06:00 - more unhappy sometimes yeah so then it
06:04 - becomes like okay now that I've secured
06:05 - this level of security yeah now what
06:08 - right and it's a scary thing that's what
06:11 - the midlife crisis is for people when
06:13 - they're 50 luckily we've arrived at it a
06:16 - lot earlier and I think a little more
06:18 - proactively than reactively yes which is
06:20 - a good thing you're definitely you know
06:23 - I would say ahead in terms of like where
06:27 - I want to be in terms of when I listen
06:29 - to you talk about your alignment with
06:32 - your business goals life goals and kind
06:35 - of
06:35 - you're at and I really appreciate you
06:38 - know that about you where you took the
06:40 - time to really look introspectively
06:42 - because a lot of the coaches and
06:45 - motivational things out there just like
06:46 - do more do more do more and I feel like
06:49 - I have done a lot more and I have
06:50 - grinded a lot and I did put in twenty
06:52 - hours a day but it's not about that
06:55 - anymore
06:56 - yeah you know like I really want for
06:58 - example the students to be really
07:00 - successful so one of the things that is
07:02 - you know like there's an online course
07:04 - that I told you about that I have yeah
07:06 - and students are going through and
07:07 - that's great but I want to be able to be
07:11 - there for the students in a better way
07:13 - in a way that they'll become more
07:15 - successful and I can be more accountable
07:18 - right you know and that they can have
07:20 - more accountability and a higher success
07:22 - rate and so will that make me more money
07:26 - maybe yeah but it will definitely give
07:30 - me a lot more happiness and fulfillment
07:33 - fulfillment you feels good about what
07:35 - you're doing and you don't know what you
07:36 - don't know yes whatever you did up into
07:38 - that point it's what you knew yes but
07:40 - now that you now that you see it you
07:42 - can't unsee it
07:43 - yes right and this happened to me within
07:45 - the gym you know we use the analogy of
07:48 - we used to do a group on ramp and the
07:50 - goal is just get as many people to try
07:51 - CrossFit right yeah I was in non-rem we
07:54 - were in the on ramp yeah and it worked
07:56 - for some people yeah but it didn't work
07:59 - for a lot of people and it's because we
08:00 - had one product a round peg and we try
08:04 - to you know fit a round peg in a square
08:05 - hole kind of thing yeah and so it works
08:08 - for some people and it's not the
08:10 - survival of the fittest really if your
08:12 - goal is to help people and help people
08:14 - deeply rather than like help as many
08:17 - people as you can right so you come to
08:18 - this realization of like am i helping
08:20 - people by introducing to this and then
08:22 - having them fail or can I do it better
08:26 - yes right which is pretty interesting
08:27 - and then when you know that then you
08:29 - have to do it yeah if something can be
08:31 - better yes you have to pursue that and I
08:33 - have a thing called the relentless
08:35 - pursuit of better Wow
08:36 - and if you can live by that principle
08:38 - and it's not like pathologically
08:39 - pursuing better because that could be it
08:41 - too but there's a fine line between
08:42 - pathological and in genius Wow right
08:46 - yeah so yeah so you're hitting that or
08:48 - you've hit that I've hit that I think
08:50 - it's a natural progression yeah of just
08:53 - the growth the inner growth of an
08:55 - entrepreneur right yeah I agree I love
08:59 - that you the reckless pursuit of a
09:01 - pursuit of better being better
09:03 - the relentless producer says that come
09:06 - does that kind of come from Tim Grover
09:07 - the relentless book a little bit or
09:09 - doesn't know so you know what's funny is
09:10 - I don't consume a lot okay from the
09:13 - outside in and it's only because I've
09:16 - realized like I do better with with less
09:19 - input because it it introduces more
09:21 - noise and confusion for my own direction
09:23 - yeah and I think there's like universal
09:27 - truths that people arrive at yeah no
09:28 - matter what they do
09:29 - because they run into problems and you
09:31 - have to solve them yeah that was like
09:33 - super interesting to me dude like when
09:35 - you told me that you were I think they
09:37 - were talking about Facebook Messenger
09:38 - and you were talking about like looking
09:40 - introspectively and I feel the more the
09:45 - business was growing I was kind of you
09:48 - know I'm hiring mentorship and I'm
09:50 - getting coaches and they're great
09:53 - they're great but I feel like I'm just
09:56 - looking more and more outward rather
09:58 - than inward and what ends up happening
10:00 - is I might end up doing the thing I was
10:02 - gonna plan to do in the first place
10:04 - anyway right but now there's just like a
10:06 - lot more resistance and it just takes
10:08 - way longer to do that thing whereas like
10:11 - before I just executed that you acted
10:15 - yeah and when I you know based on all
10:18 - the different business models based on
10:20 - that clever programmer shouldn't have
10:22 - grown as fast right but the reason why
10:25 - it grew
10:26 - normally fast and in a good way was
10:30 - because there wasn't a lot of noise I
10:32 - would just go to my office that I got in
10:34 - Chicago Regis I still have it
10:37 - God you can't get out of that contract
10:39 - yeah get out of here yes I've been
10:40 - paying for that forever but okay when I
10:43 - would go to that place I just sit in
10:45 - this little like 400 square feet room
10:48 - yeah but like nothing else to do but
10:50 - work you know just execute now get there
10:52 - 5:00 a.m. in the morning and I would
10:54 - leave 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. go home sleep
10:56 - yeah and then maybe go to the gym and
10:58 - just like rinse and repeat rinse and
10:59 - repeat yeah
11:00 - now those were in the days where
11:02 - everything grew the fastest because I
11:04 - feel like I had the least amount of
11:05 - noise and now I have all these ideas and
11:08 - like you know internal fulfilment and
11:11 - clarity and alignment and like doing
11:13 - something that gives value but it is
11:15 - also really true and authentic to myself
11:17 - and you know speaking with different
11:20 - coaches and different opinions and it's
11:22 - like there's a lot of it just takes me a
11:24 - lot longer so when you told when you
11:26 - share that with me that kind of really
11:29 - rang true with me internally like you
11:31 - know that gut reaction yeah it's kind of
11:33 - like a gut reaction and I'm like I feel
11:35 - like I need to start looking more in it
11:39 - introspectively
11:40 - yeah like in wordly and trust it more
11:42 - and I feel like as people we're scared
11:45 - to do that because then we can't blame
11:48 - it on something else yeah you know I
11:50 - agree yeah you really have to
11:54 - you gotta believe in yourself what
11:56 - worked for somebody else might not work
12:00 - for you and in how you actually operate
12:02 - right so I operate on on I'd say I
12:08 - operate best when creating and to be
12:12 - creative
12:13 - you have to use logic as a tool but
12:17 - logic cannot be the only tool like
12:19 - there's there's something that
12:20 - transcends logic and I create amazing
12:23 - things when I can transcend logic and
12:26 - then do things that maybe other people
12:30 - would not feel comfortable doing yeah
12:31 - that seem counterintuitive to success
12:34 - yes um and maybe you could never work
12:36 - for them because they don't see that
12:39 - there is another layer yeah and maybe
12:41 - logic only work for them so they're
12:42 - gonna tell you the logic is the way and
12:44 - it is a way yes a way but it's not the
12:46 - only way you have you know what I mean
12:48 - yeah um and you can't be definite that
12:51 - logic is the only way and tell people
12:53 - this is the only way yes anybody that
12:55 - tells me this is the only way it's right
12:57 - off immediately yeah I prove people
12:59 - wrong all the time all the time so
13:01 - Zappos I just got back from an awesome
13:03 - training company called wat if I flew
13:05 - them out to train their entire staff on
13:07 - customer service and culture Wow's
13:09 - apples flew them all zap no butterfly
13:11 - paid them as consulting so it's apples
13:13 - so world-renowned for customer service
13:15 - Zappos gets 40% of their orders returned
13:19 - so 40% of the orders get returned
13:22 - logically that sounds like a horrible
13:24 - business model but they're hyper
13:26 - profitable Wow and their purpose
13:28 - statement and they haven't always been
13:30 - this way but they've developed this
13:31 - culture that their purpose is to deliver
13:34 - wow it's very big yeah deliver wow what
13:38 - does that mean well it means that some
13:40 - customer service girls stayed on the
13:42 - phone for 12 hours with the customer and
13:44 - that was delivering mom not logical but
13:48 - they're hyper profitable Edison say
13:50 - they'll get 40% of their orders returned
13:52 - if somebody wants to try eight pairs of
13:54 - shoes yeah they'll say order I'll eat
13:56 - all colors wouldn't return the ones you
13:59 - want not logical but it works right but
14:01 - is it work because everybody believes in
14:03 - it
14:04 - Wow here's an interesting anecdote ease
14:07 - that is tied to me personally and I'm
14:10 - the idiot that learns the hard way yeah
14:12 - all the time
14:13 - and but but these lessons stick with me
14:15 - and I fail and I make mistakes I've
14:18 - learned I grow I just I built this place
14:23 - without any expectation of outcome
14:26 - I had a corporate job as making a
14:28 - killing in sales and I built this place
14:30 - with passion and purpose literally just
14:34 - making people happy and doing the right
14:35 - thing all the time and then I went a
14:40 - little too deep on logic at one point
14:42 - and began diving way too far into
14:44 - metrics way too far into numbers making
14:46 - decisions based on the outcome hmm and
14:50 - there's a a time stamp in my revenue
14:55 - where that change occurred and it began
14:58 - to dip and it was tough man it was like
15:04 - okay and then and then the more dip the
15:06 - more logical I got because I needed to
15:08 - solve the problem and it came up with
15:09 - intricate solutions architect at all
15:11 - these beautiful things based on logic
15:14 - and the reality was I needed to get back
15:16 - to who I was and who the person was that
15:18 - actually the Brian that created this
15:21 - place yeah and it's been like this uh
15:23 - it's been this amazing journey because
15:25 - I've learned so much and owning a gym
15:27 - like this and being a leader it's kind
15:30 - of like the the crash course your crash
15:33 - MBA yeah you make a choice in a decision
15:35 - in and you can see how it plays out in
15:39 - reality yeah you get instant feedback
15:41 - ultimate crash course it's amazing so
15:43 - you make tremendous progress as a leader
15:46 - if your intuitive and introspective and
15:49 - you can look at things objectively and
15:51 - say wow that did not work or that's
15:53 - because I did this or that so it's
15:55 - amazing to think
15:57 - logic is great but it's a tool I hundred
16:00 - percent agree with that and I think what
16:03 - happens is that you get put at a very
16:06 - disadvantageous position when you think
16:10 - that logic is the only way or you think
16:13 - the creative ways the only yeah and I
16:16 - think you have to be open to both so for
16:19 - example my audience you know some of you
16:21 - guys are software developers or want to
16:24 - become software developers we think very
16:27 - logically right code is either right or
16:29 - wrong yeah a lot of us also do math
16:33 - right there's always one right answer
16:36 - yeah you know but maybe they're
16:38 - different ways to get to it and then
16:40 - also I have played chess you know and so
16:44 - it's very logical right but it's also
16:46 - very creative there's a lot of
16:48 - creativity that gets involved but you
16:50 - know at the end of the day it's like
16:51 - pretty logical and so we get
16:53 - incentivized for a lot of our logical
16:55 - behavior by accept then and there are
16:58 - certain points where you hit plateaus
17:00 - you know and if I think about like would
17:03 - say Copernicus who had a vision that
17:05 - there were multiple worlds yeah you know
17:07 - and he proved it to be true you can't
17:10 - logically just come up to that complain
17:12 - you can't just logic your way through
17:14 - that there needs to be some imagination
17:16 - to some creativity right and then he had
17:18 - to prove it maybe using a tool like
17:20 - logic that could prove it and it was
17:22 - like a system that everybody else could
17:24 - understand right and the Newton had to
17:27 - do the same thing where he developed
17:28 - calculus apparently on a freaking farm
17:30 - right and that was a tool to communicate
17:32 - about certain like ideas yeah but those
17:35 - are just that tools yeah
17:37 - the imagination is and creativity is
17:39 - what created something out of the
17:41 - literally thin air and I like what you
17:43 - said about your the asset you're the
17:45 - magician yeah and so for example in the
17:49 - world of programmers were very logical
17:51 - and so you know I'll hear that on my
17:53 - channel like sometimes you know and
17:55 - sometimes it drains me but now it
17:57 - doesn't really bother me anymore but
17:59 - like I'll talked about like you can be
18:01 - making $50 an hour you get me making
18:03 - $150 an hour like it's not hard by
18:06 - I had only a few years of experience and
18:08 - I was making hundred fifty to two
18:09 - hundred dollars an hour right and when I
18:12 - share that with people
18:13 - I almost feel like I'm scamming them
18:16 - right because I'm thinking that they're
18:20 - thinking that yeah because I get
18:22 - comments they're like fifty dollars an
18:24 - hour I've been working for 15 years and
18:27 - I'm making $40 an hour right you know so
18:29 - it's like something that's just not even
18:31 - possible
18:32 - except the layer that they don't see
18:35 - because the only way they're thinking
18:36 - about it is like well I need 10 more
18:39 - years of experience right right don't I
18:41 - need like four more master's degrees ha
18:44 - ha and that's gonna cost me X and it's
18:46 - not worth it or this exactly yeah how
18:48 - about this you go in and you talk to
18:52 - your boss but you know you take him out
18:54 - to a lunch or you build a relationship
18:56 - with him and and you know maybe find a
19:00 - way to provide more value than anybody
19:02 - else does may find those biggest
19:03 - leverage points and ask yeah you know a
19:07 - lot of the times in my life I've just
19:08 - asked and I've received yeah you know
19:11 - huge um and so that's not logical no but
19:16 - you know how comes somebody makes a
19:19 - billion dollars right works less hard
19:21 - than you yeah and it's making that money
19:23 - right right right and so I don't think
19:26 - it's one way or the other it's like you
19:29 - have to be kind of open to it and let it
19:30 - you know and so that's why I talk a lot
19:32 - about soft skills on my channel you know
19:34 - guys sharing them yeah yeah 80% of what
19:36 - I say is like but you already got the
19:38 - logical mindset that's why you're
19:39 - watching these videos you're holding
19:41 - more power right that's already your
19:43 - superpower but like you need to open
19:45 - yourself up to the soft skills and
19:46 - that's the biggest leverage point like
19:48 - that's where people can easily break
19:50 - through six-figure salary yeah so it's
19:54 - it's wonderful to kind of hear that yeah
19:56 - it's pretty cool um you know you
19:59 - mentioned something about you know
20:01 - planning out or being fulfilled and
20:03 - planning out 10 20 30 years from now
20:05 - yeah
20:07 - and I'm really big on leading people to
20:11 - feel fulfilled on a daily basis right
20:14 - right so I've caused a lot of
20:16 - unnecessary suffering for myself and
20:18 - other people because I didn't understand
20:20 - my strengths yeah I didn't understand my
20:23 - weaknesses I try to be everything to
20:25 - everybody um but I also put the lot of
20:28 - my team into positions of weakness and I
20:33 - believe in the growth mindset like I
20:35 - believe that that is a very necessary
20:37 - mindset to have them all about mindset
20:39 - so describe growth mindset just a little
20:42 - bit so the growth mindset is you know
20:46 - not avoiding the things you're bad at
20:48 - and using everything as an opportunity
20:50 - to learn so if you fail there's always a
20:53 - lesson in failure learning and not being
20:55 - afraid to fail right the fixed mindset
20:57 - is thinking that people are just good at
20:59 - things right off the bat all right you
21:02 - know you're you're born with the talent
21:03 - they use words like gifted right or he
21:06 - exploited like the business just
21:07 - exploded all right he became a
21:08 - successful or Knight oh sure and he
21:10 - might have had natural tendencies toward
21:12 - his career path which allowed him to
21:15 - really go all in on his strengths and
21:17 - make them superpowers but it still took
21:20 - deliberate practice yes it's a building
21:23 - of good habits and all that you know so
21:26 - to think about like the fixed mindset
21:27 - and growth mindset I actually grew up
21:29 - with a fixed mindset just thinking
21:30 - people were better at things and other
21:32 - things and I just was never gonna be
21:34 - good at it and when I found I was
21:37 - working at CDW first corporate job ever
21:40 - and I hated every minute of it it was
21:41 - phone sales you had the cold call people
21:43 - and I sucked that was awful and I come
21:45 - over every day to my girlfriend who's my
21:47 - wife at the time and I'm like honey I
21:49 - can't do this anymore like this is not
21:50 - me and I ended up joining CrossFit at
21:54 - the time yeah and I just wanted to
21:55 - change I was like thirty pounds
21:56 - overweight and it was really like this
21:59 - this transformative point in my life
22:01 - where I started realizing like hey I
22:03 - suck it at this but I can see how I can
22:06 - get better and it's a daily thing that
22:08 - like okay I'm a little bit better I'm a
22:10 - little bit better so you have a faster
22:11 - path to realization yeah for the work
22:13 - that you put in and the feedback that
22:14 - you get back yeah and I started applying
22:16 - that to the job at CDW in sales
22:19 - and I went from being like the worst guy
22:21 - in the team literally to making ten
22:24 - times the amount that I was making
22:26 - originally yeah making top 10% ten times
22:30 - and or ten Xing my my income damn after
22:33 - like five years it was all the shift in
22:36 - mindset that was in in it took time in
22:39 - developing those skills but it is the
22:42 - shift in mindset right would you say you
22:43 - were working ten times harder to make 10
22:45 - times more income at that time no um I
22:49 - didn't quite believe in my my strengths
22:51 - at the time either it was you know ten
22:53 - years ago maybe yeah like ten years ago
22:55 - a little longer
22:56 - um I put in the hours but it was putting
22:59 - in the hours to learn how to work less
23:02 - like working hard or first so I can be
23:05 - smarter
23:06 - yeah and I'm work less and it came to a
23:08 - point where I'm you know I realized uh I
23:11 - could probably do this in like an hour's
23:13 - time Chuck and it's very similar like
23:14 - Tim Ferriss 4-hour workweek using the
23:16 - same kind of role probably as middle
23:18 - management doesn't like that they want
23:20 - you to put in the hours
23:21 - but like deliberate hours versus just
23:23 - fluff hours are different right very
23:24 - different um in it's very difficult to
23:27 - just put in fluff hours when you know if
23:30 - you have an hour it's a good time busy
23:32 - versus effective correct yeah yeah I'm
23:35 - just like working out you go to the gym
23:36 - and mess around for 2-3 hours and
23:38 - getting nothing accomplished we can go
23:40 - to a CrossFit class in an hour you get
23:42 - everything accomplished you're done for
23:44 - the day and it's super effective right
23:46 - but it's an intense hour right yeah I
23:48 - feel like it's what gets reinforced over
23:50 - time you know and so we learn
23:53 - it's like learned behaviors and so for
23:55 - example the school system or a lot of
23:58 - those things they don't they don't
24:01 - incentivize you necessarily for being
24:04 - more effective it a lot of the times
24:06 - incentivizes you for putting in that
24:10 - time quote/unquote right you know like
24:12 - for example you can't get more than an A
24:14 - but so somebody who is smart let's say
24:17 - figures out how to get an A now they
24:20 - don't have an incentive to go more than
24:22 - that right and you know those are the
24:26 - things that kind of build that behavior
24:28 - or overtime but you have to but when
24:31 - you're running something like a business
24:34 - there is no a right you know it can
24:37 - always get better it can always improve
24:39 - and so that's why sometimes as
24:41 - entrepreneurs we feel like it allows us
24:44 - to really push ourselves to the limit
24:45 - you know yeah then you you keep going a
24:47 - lot at the time right and the scary part
24:50 - about that is the good part about it is
24:53 - that it helps you push yourself the
24:54 - scary part is you can just keep going
24:56 - forever without like looking
24:57 - introspectively and like Tony Robbins
24:59 - says and I you know and I believe this
25:02 - that success with our fulfillment he
25:04 - says is the ultimate failure yeah and it
25:07 - literally leads to horrible horrible
25:11 - things from like a psyche perspective
25:13 - right um feeling trapped feeling like
25:16 - what you've created has trapped you
25:18 - being you know one one move away from
25:19 - checkmate yeah I've gone through it all
25:21 - within my own passion yes I've done it
25:24 - to myself
25:25 - right yeah that's why I think it's
25:27 - really important to know who you are
25:29 - know other people and help them
25:31 - understand who they are so you can't do
25:33 - that to yourself yes yeah
25:35 - one exercise that I I do with everybody
25:37 - and it's not religious but can I write
25:40 - any for sure so this is like an audit of
25:43 - yourself and where you staff on a daily
25:46 - basis okay
25:47 - - look introspectively and I say it's
25:49 - not religious because I'm using terms
25:50 - but let's call it hell purgatory tie
26:01 - these together cool so I asked my team
26:04 - frequently Wow hello predatory heaven I
26:08 - like it when we preach the gym owners
26:10 - everybody myself everything um hell is
26:13 - the things that you do on a daily basis
26:15 - that you load for how that drain you
26:18 - that you detest right yes heaven is the
26:21 - things that you do on a daily basis that
26:23 - make you light up were the things that
26:25 - you want to be doing that you're not
26:27 - doing that make you light up right yeah
26:28 - um so no I mean it's gonna be like your
26:30 - strengths and superpowers right now
26:32 - purgatory is things that you're
26:35 - proficient at and indifferent about so
26:38 - it might be good at something limbo
26:40 - limbo right yes
26:42 - thing that you're proficient at
26:43 - indifferent maybe you have to do it
26:45 - temporarily because you're the business
26:46 - owner but really the big focus is okay
26:51 - let's list five things here five things
26:54 - here are five things here let's just
26:56 - completely get rid of these instantly
26:58 - your life will be ten times better and
27:00 - happier and then let's make a plan to
27:03 - offload these now the trick is you
27:06 - cannot offload the things that drain you
27:08 - to another person that it also drains
27:10 - that's that's not fair that's so
27:12 - important like anybody who's gonna be
27:15 - running a business thing about running a
27:16 - business just say that again for them
27:18 - that's so important so you cannot
27:19 - offload the things that drain you that
27:22 - you load to other people who had also
27:25 - drains
27:25 - yes below that it's a temporary solution
27:27 - but it's not a fix I'm done it yes I
27:30 - think we all have right now the half
27:33 - year to a year long painful mistake may
27:36 - have been more years and you have to let
27:38 - that person eventually go or something
27:40 - and it's a painful it's emotionally
27:43 - painful as mentally painful and it's it
27:46 - cost she's financially painful yes I
27:48 - call it unnecessary suffering yes and a
27:51 - service for everybody for everybody
27:53 - involved and so that's why you say that
27:56 - it's so important to understand your
27:58 - personality type but yeah what not and
28:00 - so you know Colby tests and all those
28:02 - things yeah many ways to skin the cat
28:05 - there yeah now just because you load
28:08 - things and it drains you yes does it
28:11 - mean other people don't light up while
28:13 - doing those things yes right yeah and we
28:15 - we make them as stay it's really hard to
28:17 - believe that it is it's like if I hate
28:19 - it who's gonna like this right and I
28:21 - feel that I don't want to I don't want
28:23 - to you know like you know push it off on
28:25 - them but the reality is like you're not
28:27 - doing it anyway and you're doing it
28:29 - poorly if you are yeah so if you're
28:31 - giving your 20% and they're giving it
28:32 - 100 they're gonna be better off happier
28:34 - by doing the things I make them light up
28:36 - yes so it's really easy on it to do
28:39 - frequently if you have a team you should
28:41 - do it for yourself for sure
28:43 - yeah in life you can put you know people
28:45 - that dream you rather than things that
28:47 - dream you same philosophy really easy to
28:50 - do right well yeah
28:52 - that's brilliant it's it's just a
28:54 - universal truth that you arrive at after
28:57 - screwing up so many times we do this
28:59 - with your team every week not every week
29:01 - no or like kind of once frequently like
29:04 - let's call it quarterly right or earlier
29:05 - um because things how you do it kind of
29:08 - one-on-one or do you do it mostly like
29:10 - let's say in a meeting with a group of
29:12 - people it depends
29:13 - um I've done it in groups I've done it
29:16 - you know I gave a talk 250 gym owners
29:19 - and 100 coaches we hosted a business
29:21 - summit here oh that's all for a company
29:23 - that I business mentor for to bring
29:25 - business and have footage of that I do a
29:28 - little bit it was awesome but I made
29:30 - everybody do this and the the owners
29:32 - brought their team members the coaches
29:34 - and I told the coaches like guys by the
29:38 - very principle that we teach we teach
29:39 - what we call the perfect day like we
29:41 - should be striving no when you were when
29:43 - you were calling it that you know
29:45 - there's something I've created I don't
29:47 - know if I shared it with you I literally
29:48 - call it the my perfect day technique
29:51 - okay and I thought I was the only one
29:53 - who came up with it universal truth this
29:55 - is crazy and I made this video a while
29:57 - ago on top floor ways to stop
29:59 - procrastinating okay and it's not a
30:01 - motivational video it's like very
30:03 - strategic and tactical yeah and it's a
30:05 - great video I have it on YouTube and in
30:07 - that one of the things I say is like the
30:09 - perfect day technique so okay awesome
30:11 - so go ahead shorter you know the gym
30:15 - owners brought their team and there were
30:16 - separate rooms Hunter coaches 150 gym
30:19 - owners by the way guys it's that's
30:21 - incredibly hard to do like to get people
30:26 - to show up it's really hard like clever
30:28 - programmer you on YouTube it's like
30:29 - pretty huge but I'd be lucky if I can
30:32 - get like three people to show up in one
30:33 - spot cuz it's like it's just difficult
30:36 - and so getting 150 gym business owners
30:41 - like that's tough so that's awesome and
30:44 - you were giving a speech to them so to
30:46 - them and then 100 coaches separately so
30:48 - what are 50 people in total we're here
30:50 - for the to bring business summit for the
30:53 - coaches I said listen guys we teach the
30:56 - gym owners that they should pursue their
30:58 - perfect day and here's what
30:59 - and you've probably heard of it by the
31:01 - very principle of them pursuing the
31:03 - perfect day they have to do it for you
31:05 - too as the coaches as their staff
31:07 - members right so I made them describe it
31:09 - a little bit perfect perfect it's just
31:11 - like an ideal day like what would that
31:12 - look like it changes frequently but what
31:14 - are the things that you want to do what
31:16 - are the things that you don't want to do
31:18 - like do you want to work in the business
31:19 - for two hours do you want to work on the
31:22 - business for two hours you want to work
31:23 - out you want to spend your time with
31:24 - your family everyone has a different
31:26 - purview
31:26 - just define it and use it as a an anchor
31:29 - point or a goal to strive towards you
31:31 - might never get there but your life
31:33 - would be better if you pursue it right
31:34 - yes so I made the coaches go through
31:37 - this exercise okay and I'm like guys you
31:39 - you have to go to the your bosses who
31:41 - are in that other room yeah and tell
31:43 - them personal training drains me and
31:45 - then it's not doing anybody any any
31:47 - justice yeah I have another philosophy
31:50 - that I personally use with the team and
31:52 - everybody it's win win win you're a
31:53 - business owner and you're teaching your
31:55 - staff members to make decisions without
31:57 - you the win-win-win philosophy is it's
32:00 - gotta be a win for the business a win
32:02 - for the staff member and a win for the
32:04 - client Wow and if you can run everything
32:05 - through that filter then it's great
32:08 - that's great so if you're introspective
32:10 - enough to know that you're not effective
32:12 - in one area then you should fire
32:13 - yourself and then work on the things
32:15 - that make you light up because the
32:17 - clients not winning the business isn't
32:19 - winning and you're not winning right yes
32:21 - so relate that to personal and if you
32:23 - don't own a business the world isn't
32:25 - winning if you're doing the things that
32:27 - aren't within your strengths and they
32:29 - drain you right yes and that's sometimes
32:31 - what stops you from you know growing
32:34 - through that like a lot of times people
32:35 - are like I'm stuck at that one level
32:37 - where I'm making certain income how do I
32:38 - get past it how do I get past it if you
32:41 - can really understand the people who are
32:43 - in position to give you a higher paying
32:45 - job the only way that will take place is
32:48 - if their business wins and that
32:50 - businesses clients win right and so for
32:54 - you to be able to do that you have to
32:55 - see where your biggest leverage points
32:57 - are not where you can put in the most
32:58 - hours right but where you light up where
33:01 - you're in your zone of genius so you can
33:03 - leverage your skill set and that's where
33:07 - you will see the biggest impact on your
33:08 - bottom line in revenue you know for
33:11 - people who are like let's say you're
33:12 - doing
33:12 - job right and that's like an important
33:14 - thing for people who are doing a job
33:15 - right to do good work you have to do
33:17 - things that you're passionate about
33:19 - period so when you talked about
33:22 - procrastinating if you procrastinate on
33:25 - something more than likely it's not
33:27 - within your realm of strengths and
33:29 - there's a reason why you're not you're
33:30 - not working on it right yeah I mean okay
33:32 - so sometimes like honestly so one thing
33:36 - that happens with me is I get bored
33:38 - right I'm like I get it like this is how
33:40 - you do it and it's it gets boring so
33:42 - it's like I had I love training people
33:45 - like I love kind of making videos on new
33:49 - coding tutorials and whatnot yeah but
33:51 - it's like sometimes it's not the thing
33:55 - that wants me to wake up in the morning
33:57 - no yeah and maybe at one time it was it
34:00 - was but if it's not now then then you
34:03 - have to find somebody who excites up the
34:05 - joys and so one of the things is like
34:07 - for clever programmer you know what I am
34:10 - thinking about is like I don't you know
34:12 - I wanted to be something bigger than
34:13 - myself
34:14 - and before I started and before it was
34:16 - kind of like it it became too much for
34:20 - me personally yeah my vision was I want
34:23 - coding to be like a course subject in
34:26 - the world like I want everybody in the
34:29 - world to know some form of coding yeah
34:31 - that's all because I think it's so
34:32 - important it's such an important way of
34:34 - thinking and it makes you so like so
34:37 - many people have so many ideas but then
34:38 - they can't create it yeah you know so
34:40 - for me it was like you can have any idea
34:42 - like the crazy side you know you know
34:43 - how we're operating in cloud 9 yeah and
34:45 - then imagine being able to turn into
34:47 - this physical thing everybody in the
34:48 - world can download right so it's amazing
34:51 - yeah it's like the ultimate artists you
34:53 - know everybody can use your art like in
34:55 - seconds and it's the ultimate gift you
34:57 - can give somebody it's teaching them how
34:59 - to fish right rather than teaching them
35:00 - how to fish right and so you know
35:02 - history is a core subject and masses of
35:04 - course subject you know I sucked at math
35:06 - and I tell this to everybody I sucked at
35:08 - math people think I was so good at math
35:09 - no I was like feeling it yeah but when I
35:11 - found coding what I would do is I would
35:13 - take physics and math and those things
35:14 - that they just give you as formulas yeah
35:16 - I don't we don't learn with formulas you
35:18 - know people like you and I and so I
35:21 - would like create the thing in
35:23 - programming I'll create a little cannon
35:25 - Oh
35:25 - shoot like the ball at different angles
35:27 - yeah and I'm like oh that's why
35:29 - 45-degree angle is the best English
35:31 - shoot a javelin or a throw a Canon at
35:33 - right and so for me allowed me to see
35:36 - those abstract things right and it
35:39 - allowed me to turn things into tangible
35:41 - reality and not just like talking clouds
35:44 - so for me it was like this amazing thing
35:47 - and I wanted to share it with the world
35:48 - and I'm like this should be a course
35:49 - subject she's not taught right next to
35:51 - history English all those things but as
35:54 - I got more and more into the business
35:57 - and like kind of I am the business like
36:00 - last month I was sick and there were no
36:02 - videos right you know there's no
36:04 - business yeah and if my mood changes and
36:07 - let's say I'm depressed well people see
36:09 - that energy so I'm not gonna create a
36:11 - video and don't can't be on all day long
36:13 - and what I'm thinking it's just work
36:14 - work work it takes that enjoyment out of
36:19 - it and the masterpieces I would create
36:21 - because now I'm not thinking I need to
36:22 - create a mass should be something I need
36:23 - to create something every week right and
36:25 - that just sounds like a chore yeah and I
36:28 - don't want to do it anymore right right
36:30 - and that's a scary thing yeah um and so
36:33 - now I'm like I you know and so basically
36:37 - the things that used to wake me up in
36:38 - the morning don't wake me up anymore and
36:40 - so I'm I was thinking last month I'm
36:43 - like am I just lazy or did I lose the
36:45 - hive yeah and then I started thinking
36:47 - about what would wake me up in the
36:48 - morning and I thought about something
36:50 - and I don't do that anymore
36:51 - but what would wake me up as I remember
36:54 - I would go to chess tournaments okay and
36:56 - I don't care how early there were 7 or 8
36:58 - a.m. and that was my [ __ ] favorite
37:01 - thing yeah to wake up for it doesn't
37:04 - matter if I slept at 4 a.m. I wake up 6
37:06 - a.m. get there nice and early I have my
37:09 - coffee I find out who I'm gonna play
37:11 - against I started researching their
37:12 - games like talking with people right
37:15 - it's the most amazing experience ever
37:17 - for me so I'm like there are things I
37:20 - would wake up for sure but I just need
37:22 - to look more in inward leaf 1 - it made
37:26 - me realize that you know I need to stop
37:29 - beating myself up for not wanting to do
37:32 - the things that you know are I'm like
37:35 - I need to do it because gonna grow the
37:37 - business and if I'm not doing I beat
37:38 - myself up right right and maybe like you
37:41 - said you know turn clever programmer
37:43 - into a platform for cashing the
37:46 - developers who want to share that
37:47 - message right and then give and let them
37:51 - have the platform you know and share
37:52 - with the world so the world gets even
37:54 - more about yeah yeah so that's it's a
37:57 - it's just a natural evolution of the
38:00 - entrepreneur especially the creative
38:03 - entrepreneur where you've personally
38:05 - grown so much from this but almost
38:08 - detrimental e to your point of now being
38:12 - like okay I've done it all you know I
38:14 - know how to do it all I like being the
38:16 - bottom like - you're the lot of next
38:18 - year you're the one thing kind of like
38:19 - holding your business back from
38:20 - exploding because you are the icon yes
38:25 - yeah you you are you're the business e
38:27 - you're super successful but as long as
38:31 - it requires you you own a very very high
38:34 - paying job yes and it's everything I
38:37 - mean I've run into every every
38:39 - entrepreneur runs into that good book
38:41 - the e-myth and it's a natural evolution
38:44 - but now you need to figure out like okay
38:47 - if you're creative and you you're you
38:49 - you've learned all you can learn you've
38:50 - done everything you can do to figure out
38:54 - how do you make this bigger without you
38:56 - let me ask you something so you know
39:01 - I've grown up with the mentality of and
39:03 - my family all this is if you want
39:04 - something done right yeah and I'm sure
39:07 - we're all very familiar with this do
39:09 - yourself yeah and I wanted to outgrow I
39:13 - started realizing that that's not the
39:15 - right way to think because that's not
39:17 - how businesses grow right you know so
39:21 - that was one and another thing was like
39:23 - I want I'm gonna ask you like how do you
39:26 - feel about handing how did you overcome
39:29 - handing off responsibilities to other
39:32 - people because here's how I think about
39:35 - it and how I explained it to my brother
39:36 - so I was talking to my brother one time
39:39 - and I was on a call and he was he was
39:40 - talking with me and I was like I'm
39:42 - trying to hand off you know a lot of
39:45 - responsibilities to new hires new people
39:48 - I'm hiring
39:49 - yeah and different people but I'm like
39:51 - it just doesn't feel right and then he
39:54 - goes yeah because you know it's kind of
39:56 - like they're your babies and you have to
39:57 - mentor them right and I was thinking
39:59 - about that and then the more I thought
40:00 - about it and I'm like you know what I'm
40:03 - like it's not like that it's more like
40:06 - the business is like this little toddler
40:09 - it's my baby yeah that I work really
40:11 - hard to grow and make it survive up
40:14 - until this point and then somebody else
40:16 - kind of comes in they take the baby and
40:19 - they're like hold a baby up at the top
40:21 - and then just like flip the baby and
40:24 - just drop it on its head from like ten
40:27 - feet yeah and I'm like I just witnessed
40:30 - that and now I have to go to that person
40:32 - and be like that's okay you [ __ ] up
40:34 - right and you drop them you drop my baby
40:36 - yep and now we're gonna work through it
40:38 - yeah and I have to remain calm and I
40:40 - can't get angry yeah and I have to walk
40:43 - them through the process and so I'm like
40:45 - that's more of what it's like and that's
40:47 - where it feels really painful handing
40:49 - off things from your business it is how
40:51 - did you kind of over overcome that and
40:54 - what made you what was that first
40:55 - realization that you had that you're
40:57 - like I need to overcome this and I need
40:59 - to hand it off you know it's um for me
41:02 - it was being the the the point the
41:05 - central point where everybody was
41:06 - pulling at me like there'd be a point
41:08 - four years ago I had walked through the
41:10 - gym and I couldn't I couldn't not get
41:13 - stopped and saying hey I have to change
41:15 - my membership this happened that
41:17 - happened the coach was would come to me
41:19 - and say hey I can't figure this out and
41:20 - it was being pulled in every direction
41:23 - like this super high paying corporate
41:26 - job where I had freedom and and wow you
41:29 - know amazing things by that standard and
41:34 - what I built here required everything
41:37 - from me everybody needed me I'd built it
41:39 - was my fault and it wasn't necessarily
41:41 - things are fueling you they were kind of
41:43 - draining you a little bit and I was I
41:45 - was you know walking out on the floor
41:47 - and 20 people would tell me something
41:48 - and I have to try to remember it yeah I
41:50 - didn't have proper systems in place at
41:52 - the time I was actually piss-poor at
41:54 - doing all of it actually I'm not a
41:55 - detail oriented person so I was in
41:58 - misery just like checking
42:00 - boxes and doing all this stuff so it's
42:04 - just many many lessons over time I
42:06 - realized that was not the way in if it
42:08 - had to be the way then I didn't want to
42:09 - do this anymore yes and it was very
42:10 - early on and then I realized like you
42:14 - can't like how did you learn you learn
42:16 - by dropping the baby yes many times so I
42:20 - believe that you have to give clear
42:21 - instruction you have to give
42:24 - black-and-white like here's how to do it
42:26 - so SOPs anything yeah
42:29 - but then beyond that you have to give
42:30 - them the freedom to fail that's scary
42:33 - but yeah it is scary but it's
42:35 - detrimental to their growth if you don't
42:38 - because it's the only reactant I learned
42:40 - it's only way you us and you stunt their
42:43 - growth if you're always over their
42:45 - shoulder it's kind of like I don't
42:46 - helicopter parent yeah they don't feel
42:48 - trusted yeah so you know a lot of a lot
42:51 - of misery and necessary suffering for me
42:55 - trying to be the puppet master and then
42:59 - me realizing like wow I'm literally
43:01 - hindering these people from growing
43:03 - because I'm not allowing them to grow
43:04 - did you go like really aggressive on
43:09 - some people in the store yeah and it's
43:11 - um you have some stories from that where
43:13 - you there was one specific time you
43:15 - remember where you kind of went hard on
43:17 - somebody and the way you criticize them
43:20 - yeah
43:21 - I have many sure um my wife specifically
43:25 - okay
43:26 - so I thought everybody could be or
43:29 - should be like me okay
43:30 - and I was like tyrant to myself yes and
43:34 - I produced some outcomes from it there
43:36 - was some severe consequences to my
43:38 - psyche because of it
43:39 - yes um but that's how I treated other
43:41 - people too like I was very hard on
43:43 - myself so I was very hardened other
43:44 - people like just very similar try harder
43:46 - like no no you're not getting it just
43:48 - put in 16 hours and just try as hard as
43:51 - I try yes and then I realized like I was
43:54 - making people miserable and actually the
43:57 - outcomes were ineffective and worse
43:58 - worse and it took a lot of introspection
44:01 - and you know learning about who I was
44:04 - and how people interact with each other
44:06 - yeah to realize like that is
44:08 - puppetmaster that's leading by fear and
44:10 - control and all of that in the outcomes
44:13 - are always better if you leave with love
44:14 - and empowerment right yeah but you know
44:17 - I've kind of forcing your wife to like
44:18 - put in that work and yeah and it just
44:20 - wasn't who she was it doesn't get she's
44:21 - lazy by any means it's just not how she
44:23 - operates like yeah yeah I was speaking
44:25 - German and she was speaking English and
44:27 - I was trying to force her to speak
44:28 - German and she's not you know she does
44:30 - it doesn't know it yeah I use an analogy
44:33 - of a starting lineup of a basketball
44:35 - team oh I've learned a lot about
44:36 - strengths and weaknesses yeah I was a
44:38 - great analogy I've shared that I've
44:41 - heard your shared recording on that and
44:43 - I was sharing that with multiple people
44:45 - I've told about that they were like
44:47 - that's awesome I shared this my brother
44:48 - because he's not building a team okay
44:50 - you other entrepreneurs are building a
44:52 - team and I told them you know I was from
44:53 - you and I'm like it was epic so yeah
44:55 - just you can share that now too because
44:57 - I'd be like a condensed version but I
44:59 - don't even watch sports but I think we
45:01 - can all relate to the physical
45:03 - attributes of a starting lineup for a
45:05 - basketball team so you have a power
45:06 - forward shooting guard point guard small
45:09 - forward in the center they all have
45:11 - unique strengths that allow them to play
45:13 - their position really well so what
45:16 - happens when you pull that team off the
45:18 - court bring them to the bench and begin
45:21 - moving people around and you put the
45:23 - point guard at center in the power
45:24 - forward a shooting guard and you throw
45:26 - them back onto the court and this is
45:29 - from a team perspective you can put them
45:32 - back onto the court and yes they'll
45:33 - still be playing basketball and actually
45:35 - yes they'll still be playing the game
45:37 - that they love yeah but they'll be
45:39 - ineffective yeah their confidence levels
45:41 - will drop because they're not playing
45:44 - optimally yeah
45:45 - they might grow through some adversity a
45:48 - little bit but the point guard is never
45:52 - going to be a great center it's just
45:55 - they're not equipped for it right yes so
45:57 - you know physical attributes it's a lot
45:59 - easier to see
46:00 - yes but strengths innate strengths that
46:03 - people carry it's not laziness it's just
46:06 - who they are at their very core and a
46:08 - very being I absolutely love this if you
46:11 - can figure out what your innate
46:13 - strengths are and figure out what other
46:15 - people's innate strengths are and then
46:17 - build your team
46:19 - around your gaps to support that yes you
46:22 - can accomplish amazing things yes and
46:24 - it's not tangible you can't see it yeah
46:27 - right it's not like the this five point
46:29 - nine point guard in the seven foot three
46:31 - seven yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but it's
46:33 - it's real yes just as real just as real
46:36 - that's how entrepreneurship and
46:38 - businesses work there's a lot of
46:39 - invisible things that people see that
46:42 - you and I might see or somebody who's
46:44 - running a business might see where other
46:45 - people don't see it in the start right
46:47 - they might not even see it right and
46:49 - this is what I you know money is you
46:53 - know value you can exchange it for money
46:56 - you can you can actually your value and
46:58 - vision in time right you can turn it
47:01 - into money at some point if you if you
47:03 - want to right if you don't you can keep
47:05 - just offering more and more and more and
47:07 - that's where kind of money comes from
47:08 - and so as entrepreneurs and people who
47:11 - see business you know that's how they
47:12 - the grow now the counter-argument to
47:15 - that is if you're so basically for other
47:19 - dummies like me who didn't know about
47:21 - basketball when you share that analogy
47:23 - yeah for me how I think of it about it
47:25 - is like if you're a left-back you know
47:28 - you're you're not gonna be a great
47:30 - striker you know if your strengths are
47:32 - left back or if your strengths or more
47:34 - in playmaking then maybe you're better
47:36 - in the center and not as a strike or you
47:40 - know as a Seabee center back right and
47:43 - the counter-argument is well what about
47:47 - trying out different things and then you
47:49 - can grow through adversity sure and you
47:52 - can go through growth through pain but I
47:54 - love what you said you said that there's
47:56 - a path of least resistance yeah and then
47:59 - there's every other everything else I
48:01 - love that and basically I think what
48:03 - that means how I interpret it is you can
48:08 - try every other position you can be a
48:11 - Seabee and a striker or a shooting guard
48:14 - and a point guard and all those
48:15 - different positions and bro you're gonna
48:18 - become better but would Messi be messy
48:21 - if he was or you know most people know
48:25 - cristiano ronaldo cristiano ronaldo be
48:27 - cristiano ronaldo if he was a defender
48:29 - right for a very long time and he was a
48:31 - mid
48:32 - Fielder and he was a striker right
48:34 - probably not but he became who he is
48:36 - today because he stayed in that one
48:38 - position somebody saw that vision now he
48:40 - took the path of least resistance but I
48:43 - still think he faced a lot of adversity
48:45 - there's no doubt that you can find
48:47 - adversity and opportunities for personal
48:51 - growth right within your lane and that's
48:54 - where least resistance yes I love that
48:57 - and then everything else is stumbling
48:59 - falling you know kind of bouncing around
49:01 - trying to find yourself it's good to try
49:04 - to find yourself through all that but I
49:07 - think there's a better ways to find
49:09 - yourself yeah and then you can actually
49:11 - took a shorter time if you can find
49:14 - yourself earlier on go all-in on your
49:16 - strengths make them your superpowers and
49:19 - then understand how you can work with
49:21 - other people yes right I love that I
49:24 - absolutely love that like one of my
49:26 - clients who works with me in my youtube
49:28 - program so I'm you know I'm helping
49:30 - people overcome obscurity scale their
49:33 - business yeah successful entrepreneurs
49:35 - and help them you know crush up with
49:37 - YouTube to sell their products or
49:39 - whatever it may be and I'm working with
49:42 - him and sorry what we were just talking
49:45 - about I forget a lot so about about
49:47 - strengths yes and so one of the things
49:50 - is that he's working in like C he he's
49:53 - making a lot of money doing what he does
49:54 - currently yeah and that's great but he's
49:57 - also doing a lot of tasks that can be so
50:00 - easily outsourced and every time he
50:02 - talks with me and I asked him what's
50:05 - draining him and what's causing this
50:07 - mental fatigue then all distress and
50:09 - he's sharing with me that he's sitting
50:12 - there doing invoices for like 10 hours
50:14 - right or doing invoice of 15 hours and
50:16 - he's like Kazi but that's what makes me
50:18 - the money and I'm like but you don't
50:19 - have to do that like you know um
50:22 - somebody else can send the invoices yeah
50:24 - and he's like yeah and he's making more
50:27 - than enough to easily hire but he wants
50:30 - to even keep that chunk of the money for
50:31 - himself yeah if he has not even a full
50:34 - time independent like gosh it will take
50:37 - 10 20 K a year right paying that
50:39 - secretary or that virtual assistant yeah
50:42 - but the peace of mind that he gets and I
50:45 - easily feel like he
50:46 - in half you know 11.5 ex's income yeah
50:52 - what having very minimum have emotional
50:55 - bandwidth and energy gas I mean just
50:58 - just to be happy just to be happy that's
51:00 - the minimum the maximum is you can even
51:02 - four times your income yes get 50% of
51:05 - your day back to then leverage your
51:07 - strengths and superpowers to make more
51:09 - money yes um 100% oh god it's a hard
51:12 - hard lesson to learn so when we were I
51:13 - was at CDW they start you at CDW as a
51:16 - technology company business the business
51:18 - they start you have 25 grand they give
51:21 - you a list of some accounts to cold-call
51:24 - and sell to the minute I began making
51:28 - money we hired a full-time assistant on
51:30 - our dime for 50 grand so like people
51:33 - thought we were not for your like two
51:34 - years in to like do you guys are way too
51:36 - young you don't need it but me and my
51:38 - partner realized like that that stuff we
51:40 - actually sucked at in fact it might have
51:43 - been detrimental to the customer
51:44 - customer service so it wasn't a
51:45 - win-win-win because we didn't love it we
51:48 - sucked at it and we kept messing things
51:50 - up so we went all day and we were making
51:52 - me be a hundred grand at the time and we
51:54 - each put in you know about 30 grand each
51:57 - get this full-time assist but what that
51:59 - bought us back was emotional bandwidth
52:02 - in energy damage our strengths and
52:03 - superpowers which was building
52:05 - relationships yes typing so yeah we were
52:08 - losing 25 grand but we ended up making
52:10 - 250 grand each so why not but people
52:13 - don't have that that that thinking
52:16 - outside of the box
52:17 - they don't you have a sacrifice a little
52:20 - people don't want to make a short-term
52:23 - sacrifice like even if they're getting
52:25 - something in the long term yeah like
52:27 - they want to eat like they say they want
52:29 - a six-pack but then you put a chocolate
52:32 - in front of them yeah and the long-term
52:34 - vision of the six-pack it starts to get
52:37 - very foggy Mike and the short-term
52:39 - satisfaction from eating the chocolate
52:41 - is so strong and clear yeah that they'll
52:43 - eat the chocolate right now what's
52:45 - lacking is clarity right if they're
52:47 - extremely clear on what their body looks
52:50 - like and feels like they're not like
52:51 - well those six months from now you know
52:53 - I want a six pack they're like I want 82
52:55 - pounds of skeletal muscle mass yeah 14
52:57 - pounds of fat 10% body fat this is
52:59 - look like yeah this is what my height
53:01 - and body weight is gonna be once it's so
53:04 - clear yeah then they can look at the
53:06 - chocolate or the six month vision and
53:08 - have the same restraint right now
53:12 - holding us everything they do then
53:14 - aligns with that end goal
53:16 - so then making that tough decision is
53:18 - just as easy as eating the freaking
53:21 - chocolate right how did you start
53:25 - letting go of some of the control you
53:27 - know like what was that first thing that
53:29 - took place where you were like I'm gonna
53:31 - bring somebody else on or have them help
53:33 - me out was it your wife or was it but
53:36 - even if it was your wife how did you
53:39 - feel at that time to give up some of the
53:42 - control so with my wife it was a little
53:45 - different story because I fully trusted
53:47 - her to do anything like I believe she
53:50 - can do anything
53:52 - did it mean a broader fulfillment
53:54 - happiness no in fact it wasn't what she
53:57 - wanted to do and it brought her misery
53:59 - right so the the trust thing and giving
54:03 - it to her was easy but giving it to
54:05 - other people you know I would like feed
54:06 - a little bit see what happened feed a
54:09 - little bit see what happened and things
54:11 - would just keep dropping down like I'd
54:13 - throw it lob them a pass and it would
54:16 - just drop down and it happened
54:18 - frequently and it came to a point where
54:20 - I thought I just had like the opposite
54:24 - of the Midas touch so I thought that
54:27 - everything that I touched turned to [ __ ]
54:29 - Wow not gold and really it was a
54:34 - horrible horrible lens to view the world
54:37 - through because now everybody was like a
54:39 - threat Wow in a way right but the
54:43 - reality is I just I was in taking
54:46 - accountability for not understanding
54:47 - human nature and he'd been people yeah
54:50 - so what I learned from it all after a
54:53 - lot of a lot of suffering and a lot of
54:55 - mistakes and a lot of introspection a
54:57 - lot of learning a lot of like almost
54:59 - ruining friendships all of that was I
55:02 - didn't understand the team that I may
55:05 - need to build around me based on my
55:07 - leadership style Wow okay um so I'm not
55:11 - very good at teaching people how to do
55:14 - what I do I can do but I'm not very good
55:17 - at teaching people how to do what I do
55:18 - okay because what I do is very different
55:21 - than other people and yeah actually like
55:23 - the the in the weed stuff I'm not good
55:25 - at so I don't feel great teaching them
55:27 - that step by step I can teach them the
55:30 - concept here's what has to be done
55:31 - here's an SOP can you teach them other
55:35 - stuff like not related to how you do
55:40 - what you do but do you feel like you can
55:41 - teach them about some concept step by
55:44 - step or teaching step by step is not
55:47 - just not your thing
55:48 - so if people need their hand held and
55:53 - it's not a bad thing it's just what they
55:55 - need yeah I'm not optimal to do that I'm
55:58 - so high and far far up in the clouds
56:00 - okay that the micromanagement is not
56:03 - your thing I'm not good at micromanaging
56:05 - in fact it drains me I move it like a
56:08 - thousand miles per hour and I throw my
56:11 - fraps and I if you want to jump on on
56:15 - the boat and go for a ride it's
56:17 - beautiful
56:18 - my mistake was I would go back and try
56:20 - to save people and pull him onto the
56:22 - boat with me right right people that
56:24 - didn't necessarily want to be saved yes
56:26 - in people that just weren't equipped so
56:29 - like I'm not good at micromanaging but
56:32 - the people needed a deeper level of
56:35 - coaching from the business standpoint
56:37 - yeah that I didn't really I wasn't
56:39 - equipped for I can do it but my natural
56:42 - mode of operation is not there which it
56:45 - brought me misery right yeah and I
56:47 - didn't enjoy it and it drained me so if
56:50 - you build your business around that and
56:52 - you don't understand your leadership
56:53 - style you could end up hating your life
56:56 - right in the biggest turning point for
57:00 - me was we brought on a former gym owner
57:04 - who ended up closing her gym down went
57:07 - to go coach and we brought her on and I
57:11 - was able to throw her a few life rafts
57:13 - and she grabbed on
57:14 - Wow
57:14 - he knows that oh wow this is how it's
57:16 - supposed to work like okay wow I'm not
57:19 - better or worse than anybody right it's
57:21 - on our wall though don't shrink so that
57:25 - others don't feel insecure around you
57:26 - Wow
57:27 - um and it's not going down to the level
57:29 - but I cannot not be me yes when I'm not
57:33 - me everybody loses and everybody's
57:35 - miserable because I'm miserable and that
57:37 - carries over to your clients to
57:38 - everybody yes and I did it for a while
57:40 - yeah in that realization it kind of like
57:43 - shifted things a little bit I'm like oh
57:45 - this is how it's supposed to work Wow
57:47 - yeah and this is actually how I thrive
57:49 - as a leader and how people will thrive
57:51 - under me yeah but the people that still
57:54 - need a bit of hand-holding
57:56 - that's never gonna change I just need to
57:59 - find somebody who can do that for me
58:01 - Oh understands my strengths and my
58:03 - weaknesses understands that I'm not just
58:05 - being lazy
58:06 - yes I'm just not effective and it's uh
58:08 - it's self-awareness
58:10 - yeah it's also vulnerability to tell
58:12 - your team here's my strengths and
58:14 - superpowers and everything else I'm
58:17 - actually horrible at Wow beautiful but
58:20 - it's a scary thing as a leader yeah
58:22 - because then you you know most people
58:24 - think well what if they just go and open
58:26 - their own gym or open their own business
58:28 - because they realize you can't do
58:30 - anything it's outside of you know I call
58:31 - myself the connector of dots yeah
58:33 - but they don't want to do what I do yeah
58:35 - I never realized that yeah
58:37 - I'm really good at what I do yes okay
58:39 - just suck at everything else yeah as
58:41 - long as you can fill your gaps yeah
58:43 - in CrossFit um in Fitness it's all about
58:46 - working on your weaknesses yeah but you
58:49 - only have one player it's you right so
58:51 - you have to bring up your weaknesses to
58:52 - become better right in life it's so
58:55 - different because you could fill your
58:57 - gaps with human beings whose strengths
59:01 - are your own weaknesses yes and that
59:03 - creates sanity so important yeah I think
59:06 - that is so important what you said that
59:08 - you have to bring up your weaknesses
59:10 - just as much as you might bring up your
59:12 - strengths because if you don't bring it
59:15 - up those gaps aren't gonna be filled and
59:18 - people aren't gonna be able to help you
59:20 - with it
59:20 - right um it's kind of like the example
59:23 - of you know whether like when you say
59:26 - that you can work on your weakness
59:27 - versus work on your strengths and your
59:29 - like work on your strengths that's kind
59:31 - of like a striker he can work on defense
59:35 - when I could work on his defensive
59:36 - skills or he could just continue to work
59:39 - on his striking skills yeah so you go
59:41 - hey I'm a striker I suck a defense yeah
59:45 - could somebody please help me with
59:48 - defense yeah I'm gonna work on striking
59:50 - right um it takes a lot of giving up
59:55 - your ego yeah it's very difficult yeah
59:57 - for me personally ego luckily was never
60:01 - a thing because I had two older brothers
60:03 - to overshadow me in everything yeah one
60:06 - two I always did everything
60:08 - competitively like so when I got into
60:11 - video gaming I would play competitively
60:13 - online in tournaments and just get my
60:14 - ass handed to me all the time right so I
60:17 - became very familiar with losing and I
60:19 - became very humble right and then when I
60:21 - started chess competitions everybody
60:24 - would just mop the floor with me all the
60:25 - time and I thought I would be so good
60:27 - and I just naturally crush but it's
60:29 - objectively you lose but a lot of the
60:32 - times in life nobody calls you out on
60:34 - losing and if you don't compete a lot of
60:37 - times you don't know what a loss really
60:39 - is we're we're talking some and talent
60:41 - of like everybody is a winner for
60:42 - example right and I don't think that's
60:44 - healthy no um you should know where
60:46 - you're a weekend where you're strong and
60:48 - I don't think it's a bad thing no it's
60:50 - it's essential yes it's essential and so
60:52 - what happened with me locally was like
60:54 - when that happened
60:56 - I'm just very okay we're telling
60:57 - everybody what my weaknesses are yeah I
60:59 - can't micromanage
61:00 - I'm not very good with day to day my
61:03 - mood changes I'll get bored but I'm very
61:06 - good at thinking at high levels yeah I'm
61:08 - really good at coming up with
61:09 - breakthrough new ideas or new business
61:11 - ideas and like rallying the troops same
61:15 - thing yeah and so I can either fight
61:18 - myself for the rest of my life and hate
61:20 - myself for not wanting to do those
61:21 - things right or I can admit that I'm a
61:24 - striker yeah you know and build that
61:27 - team and so even about once he gave that
61:30 - analogy about the basketball team I
61:31 - started and I'm a soccer fan yeah I
61:33 - started to think of my team as a soccer
61:35 - team yeah and I'm like the customer
61:38 - service people that's kind of like your
61:40 - defense
61:41 - this line right you know that's your
61:43 - defense line like refunds and making
61:46 - sure everybody's happy and then you have
61:47 - like the center-field playmakers which
61:50 - might be the people we're thinking in
61:51 - the clouds yeah so one of my favorite
61:53 - players salespeople or whatever you
61:54 - might wanna call me yeah so like for
61:56 - example the people who are coming up
61:58 - with the ideas or the different plays so
62:01 - you know Zidane is one of my favorite
62:03 - soccer players and it's like they have
62:05 - to decide is it time to pass a ball to
62:07 - the center backs or is it time to pass
62:10 - the ball forward right and sales team in
62:13 - my mind is kind of like the striking
62:15 - yeah you know they're the strikers
62:16 - they're closing the deals and they're
62:18 - closing the sales but just so important
62:21 - understand yourself completely and then
62:23 - to understand other people and so even
62:25 - the people who are doing jobs right now
62:27 - understanding yourself is very important
62:29 - because you can understand what role you
62:31 - will thrive in yeah you know what role
62:33 - you will crush in because it's not okay
62:38 - doing something that makes you miserable
62:40 - or makes you feel indifferent when
62:42 - that's most of your life right what an
62:45 - average Americans work from eighteen
62:47 - till they're 65 how many years is that a
62:50 - lot of years a lot of years
62:52 - third least a third of your life and the
62:57 - other third you're sleeping you're
62:59 - working eight hours you're sleeping
63:01 - eight hours and then you might and you
63:03 - come home with bad energy yeah so the
63:05 - time you spend with your loved ones it's
63:07 - like average and mediocre time right
63:09 - then your children are not like who they
63:13 - could be
63:13 - yep and then it's like a generational
63:15 - thing and it just passes on and next
63:18 - generations are you know and so if
63:21 - you're okay with that then do it but if
63:24 - you look at it very introspectively quat
63:27 - in quietness no noise right and I feel
63:29 - like a lot of people won't be okay with
63:30 - that no and they they really shouldn't
63:33 - but it's um it's almost like you have to
63:35 - snap out of this Hayes Hayes acting mode
63:39 - that Napoleon Hills and his outwitting
63:41 - the devil calls it Ratanak rhythm right
63:43 - recommendation by the way it was amazing
63:45 - I read the book it's unbelievable
63:48 - outwitting the devil Napoleon Hill
63:49 - beautiful analogy of
63:52 - a conversation with the devil and the
63:53 - devil really is just the voice inside of
63:56 - your head that stops you from becoming
63:57 - what you could become and it just uses
64:01 - fear and outright and we all can relate
64:02 - to that but people you know though
64:07 - everything that I've learned up into
64:09 - this point made me realize my new
64:11 - purpose in life is to provide a canvas
64:15 - for people to understand themselves so
64:19 - to help adults figure out who they are a
64:21 - lot of the times people go through life
64:23 - and they stumble through life just
64:27 - trying to find themselves and then maybe
64:29 - they have student loan debt maybe
64:31 - they're in a career because they have
64:33 - student loan debt that they thought they
64:35 - wanted to do but really hate but they
64:37 - have all this debt
64:38 - now they've bought a house and they
64:40 - begin to kind of painting themselves
64:41 - into this corner then they have kids and
64:43 - then they paint themselves deeper into
64:46 - the corner and then they look up at 50
64:48 - and they realize and maybe earlier I
64:51 - hope earlier but at 50 they realize like
64:52 - what did I do like I'm trapped yeah and
64:56 - the reality is you're not trapped so
64:59 - long as you're willing to sacrifice
65:01 - everything you have for what you can
65:03 - become
65:04 - yeah and it's a common theme but people
65:06 - are deathly afraid of giving up their
65:09 - car or their house because of pride and
65:11 - ego yes or whatever it is that they're
65:13 - attached to that's stopping them it
65:16 - takes a lot of sacrifice it does I mean
65:18 - I'm sure it took a lot of sacrifice on
65:20 - your end and on my end I never really
65:22 - thought of it as sacrifice but it is
65:26 - sacrifice so like one example is when I
65:28 - was starting the business like clever
65:30 - programmer and I wanted to go all-in
65:32 - here's what I did when I started seeing
65:34 - very little traction I'm talking we
65:36 - didn't even have a thousand subscribers
65:37 - yet yeah sauce a little bit of traction
65:40 - this is where I'm like kind of like how
65:43 - you guys got the assistant before
65:45 - anybody else thought it was a good idea
65:46 - right I already had my iMac on a loan I
65:50 - had my lighting kit on a loan yeah my
65:52 - this mic that you see right here
65:54 - actually we got a loan ice the laptop
65:57 - literally everything yeah okay it was
65:59 - just on pure credit card debt
66:02 - and all the clients I had and the
66:04 - software development I was doing the
66:06 - freelancing I was doing I cut so I went
66:10 - from having a six-figure salary as a 19
66:13 - or 20 year old to zero dollars in
66:16 - revenue every month to having debt and
66:19 - then what I did on purpose is got an
66:21 - office where I was paying $1,000 a month
66:24 - okay I get additional expense and I'm
66:26 - like now I'll survive purely
66:28 - out of just need for survival almost
66:32 - like your back against the wall back
66:33 - against why and that's when I think the
66:35 - best and that's when I'm excited and
66:36 - that's when I come alive ya know like
66:39 - now this is an interesting challenge and
66:41 - so for me I did that and it a lot and
66:45 - and I dropped out of college
66:46 - okay so there's another of that and then
66:49 - so I did - oh yes I feel like it's a
66:53 - common theme and it just makes me feel
66:54 - reassured every time I hear that I think
66:56 - just I hear the rate of people you just
67:00 - you're listening to really like like
67:02 - what am I gonna use this yes I could do
67:04 - I can make it without all of this yeah
67:07 - yes yeah it's you might like it's not a
67:11 - piece of there's nothing wrong with
67:13 - education but what I've always said is
67:15 - use it as one source of Education right
67:19 - what people do is to shut their brain
67:20 - off from all forms of education they're
67:22 - not listening to audio books or not
67:24 - going to conventions they're not
67:25 - following anybody they're not listening
67:28 - to even themselves yeah and they're just
67:30 - using colleges everything yeah and
67:33 - they're letting they're just letting it
67:35 - think for them yeah they're letting it
67:37 - decide for them and they're hoping and
67:40 - praying and wishing that that piece of
67:42 - paper will entitle them yeah to a job um
67:47 - which they don't even want right scary
67:51 - yeah
67:52 - and it's I don't know it's a scary scary
67:56 - thing so ultimately it's like you know
67:58 - you don't need it if you want to go
68:00 - through it go for it right but you don't
68:03 - necessarily need it and it's ultimately
68:06 - you and just understanding that you know
68:10 - commonly coming up with something when
68:11 - you're providing value to the world it
68:13 - just can't go wrong but that's hard - I
68:15 - feel like wrap your mind around it
68:17 - really is and it's it's you know
68:18 - systemic almost brainwashing of society
68:22 - to say you have to do this yeah this is
68:24 - just part of the American dream go to
68:25 - college you know get me when that dream
68:28 - isn't a lot of people I feel like that
68:30 - dream is though the dream that people
68:34 - see other people have and then that's
68:36 - when it becomes their dream right so the
68:38 - dream of getting a degree yeah getting
68:41 - married and having kids yeah and while
68:43 - there's absolutely nothing in the world
68:46 - wrong with that the thing that might be
68:48 - wrong with it is if it didn't come from
68:50 - you and it just came from like FOMO like
68:52 - you're missing out by and that's kind of
68:55 - why you just chose that path yeah yeah
68:58 - and then you get it all and you're still
69:01 - not fully fulfilled because there's a
69:02 - hole inside of you meaning like your
69:06 - your your your soul that you're not
69:09 - pursuing your purpose you've just
69:12 - pursued an outcome no you can do more
69:14 - you pursued an outcomes that I've gotten
69:16 - the outcome and that's not fulfillment
69:18 - or happiness yeah the outcome is and
69:20 - it's the journey earnings it's finding
69:23 - your purpose and so you feel like you
69:25 - become numb through life and you kind of
69:27 - go through it and like this haze you
69:29 - know on the autopilot and you just
69:31 - accept it it's like some reality a lot
69:33 - of it um now if you can if you can jolt
69:36 - yourself out of that hypnotic rhythm
69:39 - right or you know we can call it
69:41 - programming we can call it brainwashing
69:43 - we can call it anything you want to call
69:45 - programming in a good this one's in a
69:47 - negative sense but yes
69:49 - patterns have thought through repetition
69:51 - that are enforced by society in the news
69:53 - you know everything your family yes you
69:56 - need snap out of that pull yourself out
69:58 - of the the brush and catapult yourself
70:01 - into the helicopter and look down then
70:04 - you can see clearly the clarity that
70:06 - we're looking for yes you can see the
70:08 - water you can see the lion and you can
70:09 - see the traps that are set yes
70:12 - waiting for you and you're like no I'm
70:15 - not gonna I'm actually gonna I'm gonna
70:17 - sacrifice the reality I created
70:20 - I'm gonna build my own reality I'm gonna
70:22 - construct my own reality around Who I am
70:24 - yeah and it takes so much courage
70:29 - awareness yeah
70:32 - but it's possible very possible but it
70:35 - just takes sacrificing everything you
70:38 - have from a material perspective yeah
70:40 - the attachment to it and everything does
70:42 - mean don't care it means not and it
70:44 - doesn't mean like sell everything you
70:45 - have or just go live it like a hobo
70:48 - no it's not like woo boo stuff but if
70:51 - you have a Porsche it's like and you're
70:53 - still miserable then the Porsche isn't
70:55 - making you happy right the job that
70:57 - bought the Porsche probably isn't making
70:58 - you happy maybe sell the damn Porsche
71:00 - and buy a cheaper car so you can afford
71:02 - to leave your job and do something and
71:04 - maybe it's a one-year plan maybe it's a
71:06 - three-year plan yeah but something is
71:08 - broken and you need to address the the
71:11 - cause and not the symptoms buying more
71:13 - [ __ ] is not gonna make you happy yeah
71:16 - you proved it by buying the Porsche you
71:18 - proved it by buying the house you proved
71:19 - it by getting married all the things
71:21 - buying the ring the the Rolex or the Tag
71:24 - Heuer yeah and you're still you still
71:27 - have a point so it's not that these are
71:29 - the symptoms let's not keep treating the
71:32 - symptoms let's find the root cause which
71:34 - is you haven't pursued your purpose yes
71:37 - let's be introspective figure that out
71:39 - and then develop a plan to allow
71:42 - yourself to do that maybe it's an hour a
71:44 - day of giving back I don't know what it
71:46 - is everyone's different yes yeah in but
71:50 - the looking inward is probably the most
71:53 - painful experience I've ever had it's
71:54 - scary man it's the scariest thing so I
71:57 - can understand why somebody wouldn't
72:00 - choose to look inward it's easier to
72:02 - just continue on or the status quo it's
72:06 - less painful
72:06 - it's very less pain but it's it's longer
72:09 - you know it's not as a cute but it's
72:11 - it's a lifetime of pain rather than just
72:13 - one snap out of it and I got that sucked
72:16 - but yeah now I can see clearly yes right
72:18 - and there's a lot of like so a lot of it
72:21 - comes from self-awareness and also like
72:24 - I feel like it starts at some level with
72:27 - self-awareness and just catching your
72:29 - own thoughts or the thoughts of like the
72:31 - people around you
72:32 - you know for example like this inner
72:36 - dialogue of you know when I was growing
72:38 - up a lot of the times when we would be
72:41 - we would go through this village of
72:43 - Wilmette and Winnetka oh yeah and it was
72:46 - actually our like this drive that my
72:50 - family and I would go on every weekend
72:52 - okay it was our thing
72:53 - and we would always go through it just
72:55 - look at the homes and we're like wow
72:57 - they're so amazing they're so beautiful
72:59 - and the dialogue was always like oh
73:03 - these are like really big people's
73:06 - things you know like oh we just come
73:08 - here to look at it right that's not
73:10 - something that like my mom would be like
73:12 - you know we it's not for us right it's
73:16 - like for people at a higher level right
73:18 - or this is something that we don't we
73:20 - don't know we can't do you know come on
73:22 - like that's for somebody else and those
73:24 - things would kind of suffocate me at a
73:26 - young age yeah and I heat like you would
73:28 - I would get angry and now nobody ever
73:30 - really understood why I was getting
73:31 - angry at that but those dialogues what
73:35 - happens is it just stops you from
73:38 - thinking about a possibility of
73:39 - something else like completely right you
73:42 - know and so you have to challenge that
73:46 - reality and question that reality and so
73:48 - you know the whole reality of like my
73:51 - brother became an engineer and he got a
73:53 - job or like somebody becomes somebody
73:56 - gets a degree and they get a job in a
73:57 - promotion or promotion or promotion and
73:59 - then they're retire and whether they get
74:01 - pension or not and then they die right
74:03 - you know and they barely are surviving
74:06 - every month yeah it's like when I really
74:08 - sit back and think about it even if
74:10 - you're making $100,000 a year and United
74:12 - States very tough yeah to get by with
74:15 - the type of life you want the type of
74:16 - life you want for your kids type of
74:18 - fulfillment that you want yeah because
74:21 - like okay
74:22 - people say you enjoy spending a time
74:24 - with family do you really because if you
74:27 - did then you would find a way to spend
74:28 - more time with them right that should be
74:30 - the centerpiece of your life and then
74:32 - build it around that right right if you
74:33 - really enjoy spending time with your
74:35 - family I love what you're talking about
74:36 - now where you're like I'm gonna create
74:37 - this business like and the business is
74:41 - gonna be self-sustaining where he
74:43 - provides like the main vision and what
74:45 - it's headed yeah and you're gonna be
74:47 - traveling for a year yeah in in what
74:51 - like in a in a portable house pretty
74:54 - much yeah all around the country and
74:56 - Airstream yeah but it's it's an
74:59 - adventure and I you know one on one
75:02 - prove to myself that this all can stay
75:04 - without me my my contribution to the
75:08 - business the brick-and-mortar business
75:10 - I've done everything I can do outside of
75:13 - guidance mentorship and providing
75:15 - opportunity and now it comes a time
75:18 - where you know people who are very good
75:21 - at executing and operating are gonna be
75:23 - working within their strengths and the
75:24 - things that make them light up they're
75:26 - gonna be rewarded handsomely for doing
75:27 - so filling my gaps and then it's gonna
75:30 - allow me the opportunity to continue
75:33 - pursuing the things that make me light
75:35 - up and really at the most meta meta
75:37 - macro level it is I like creating I like
75:41 - providing opportunity I like
75:43 - architecting solutions
75:44 - I like creativity and if I can do that
75:46 - for the rest of my life I will have one
75:48 - and everybody will miss everybody else
75:51 - myself my family the world if I can
75:54 - create and fill my gaps I can create
75:57 - beautiful things and everybody wins and
76:00 - if everybody can do that because not a
76:03 - groan can be mean Andrew or should they
76:05 - be because then nothing would get done
76:07 - there'd be ideas all over the whiteboard
76:09 - all over the wall and no execution thing
76:11 - would be there so nothing would be done
76:12 - you need somebody to execute implement
76:14 - and and all that yeah but it can't be
76:16 - somebody like me who does it because
76:18 - you're gonna crush them under their own
76:20 - own weight it has to be somebody who
76:22 - lights up while doing that right now yes
76:24 - uniquely equipped yes they are the
76:26 - center yeah I'm a point guard I'm never
76:28 - gonna be a good center right and it
76:30 - doesn't do the team any good if I try to
76:32 - play center yeah never that's why I need
76:35 - to I need to know what the center does
76:36 - okay I need to be able to relate to this
76:38 - position be empathetic and then work
76:41 - synergistically together as a team right
76:43 - Wow yeah ultimately I think that's
76:45 - really what it is just like when you
76:47 - understand yourself at that level it's
76:49 - allowing you to now leverage and grow
76:52 - your business probably the
76:54 - fastest it has ever grown yeah while
76:58 - you've probably I'm just assuming some
77:00 - of the things you've probably working
77:02 - less hours yeah you're probably the most
77:06 - effective and now the business is making
77:09 - the biggest impact and probably it's
77:11 - that it's have a highest revenue point
77:12 - yep
77:14 - yeah and it's it's by sacrificing some
77:17 - of the pie that doesn't exist Yeah right
77:20 - it doesn't exist yeah eating into the
77:23 - pie a little bit the existing pie by
77:26 - sacrificing some of the pie that doesn't
77:28 - exist as an incentive work as a
77:30 - collaborative team to build this to what
77:32 - it could be right and something I could
77:34 - probably never do by myself given my
77:36 - capacity my strengths or my my at this
77:40 - point in my career my willingness to do
77:41 - it right yes yeah so the the pie thing
77:45 - that you're sharing I just want to make
77:47 - it clear to the people who are watching
77:48 - it's like you know when you were when
77:50 - you were sharing that example with an
77:52 - assistant like what made you hire the
77:53 - assistant a lot of people would see it
77:55 - as like okay there is this pie you guys
77:58 - have half of it yeah now you have an
77:59 - assistant the system is gonna have so
78:01 - now it's like 33 3333 right
78:04 - percent of the pie is gonna be eaten
78:06 - except what you end up don't not
78:09 - realizing is the pie doesn't exist
78:10 - sure and second of all how I like to
78:13 - look at it is when you bring that third
78:14 - person in now you can actually figure
78:16 - out how this pie was made so you can
78:19 - just start making more pies yeah and
78:21 - maybe instead of that one pie being
78:23 - shared between two people when the third
78:25 - person comes in and there's synergy
78:27 - understanding of personality types
78:29 - putting people in positions where they
78:31 - can win all of a sudden use for making
78:34 - two for eight pies yeah and it's a
78:38 - beautiful thing everybody no resistance
78:41 - and everybody eats yeah right but you
78:42 - have to have the the four set of vision
78:44 - to say okay well I might be losing half
78:47 - of the pie right now but with the
78:49 - bandwidth and energy I get back to
78:52 - leverage my superpowers yeah I'm going
78:54 - to create ten more pies or I'm gonna
78:55 - make this pie ten times bigger however
78:58 - you want to put it and it can never get
79:00 - to that point
79:01 - you can't wait until you get to that
79:03 - point to do it because the only way
79:05 - you're gonna get to that point is by
79:06 - doing it you can't wait until it's there
79:08 - you know what I mean people make that
79:09 - mistake like oh I gotta wait until I hit
79:11 - this before I do that right
79:13 - I do that with happiness - happiness -
79:15 - that's the worst where you do it so
79:17 - where people are like I'm gonna be happy
79:20 - with when when right dangerous thing so
79:24 - for example a lot of mindset coaching I
79:27 - have to do and I'm putting people
79:28 - through my youtube program you know my
79:31 - good friend his name is Tenzin and he
79:34 - runs a channel called thank you yeah he
79:36 - runs a channel called what's dev okay
79:38 - the coding channel and he started after
79:40 - I started my clever programmer channel
79:42 - so he was really like my first kind of
79:44 - student going through the YouTube
79:46 - yeah Ram so to speak and I was mentoring
79:48 - him through a lot of it and you know
79:51 - there's a lot of um a lot of mental
79:55 - blockages that come in the way yeah
79:57 - where you where you don't want to do it
80:00 - but you kind of have to guide the person
80:01 - through it and just quickly I'm sorry to
80:03 - remind me what we were talking about
80:04 - because about like the pie and not not
80:07 - being able to see it like when we can
80:09 - make it bigger right yeah yeah so that's
80:11 - definitely one of the things so when
80:14 - you're kind of in the thick of things
80:16 - yeah it's really hard to see what's kind
80:19 - of taking place and there's always like
80:20 - mental like oh but what you end up
80:24 - realizing is that it takes just the same
80:28 - amount of work yeah as you put into your
80:30 - current job or you put at your gym or
80:34 - you put into anything else yeah and it
80:36 - takes the same amount of work to let's
80:38 - say grow a business it's just different
80:40 - type of work right same energy you know
80:42 - but yeah same same energy yep same
80:44 - manage because and I believe in this
80:46 - grant cardone says this is like energy
80:48 - is infinite that's something that you
80:50 - can never run out of right but you have
80:52 - to focus on where you're gonna kind of
80:54 - plane it to and yeah and I add or argue
80:58 - or inject that energy is finite if
81:02 - you're working on things that you write
81:05 - infinite if you're working on things
81:07 - that like you light up on doing
81:10 - yeah it's really really interesting so
81:12 - now in terms of you know this business
81:17 - kind of what's the vision and for you
81:21 - CrossFit illumine like where is it
81:24 - heading let's say 5 10 20 years from now
81:28 - so you know I call this brick-and-mortar
81:32 - right just the physical location I've
81:37 - done everything I can do from creating
81:40 - the framework / providing all the tools
81:44 - finding the right people for the right
81:46 - seats who are also on the right bus the
81:49 - right bus would be like culture and now
81:52 - it's time for them to optimize
81:53 - everything that I have and make it
81:57 - better but also allow them to make it
81:59 - different yes then what I may have
82:02 - originally set out to do but giving them
82:06 - the opportunity and empowering them to
82:10 - to make it their own yes we talked about
82:13 - it you talked a little bit about you
82:15 - know being attached to the business yeah
82:17 - and the way you can put it my good
82:19 - friend Ryan DeBell from the movement fix
82:21 - use this analogy he's a very very smart
82:24 - guy outside of the box thinker and he
82:26 - ran into the same problem with with his
82:28 - online thing used to do he's a
82:29 - chiropractor he used to do movement the
82:31 - seminars yeah we travel the world and he
82:33 - just kept levelling up and kind of
82:35 - growing as an individual and we've been
82:37 - locked stepping in that process and he
82:39 - said you have to be able to imagine you
82:42 - have a suitcase yeah and you have to put
82:44 - everything that it takes to run your
82:46 - business into that suitcase and you have
82:49 - to be able to put the suitcase down and
82:51 - then work on other things and when you
82:53 - want to pick the suitcase back up to
82:55 - work on it you can do it
82:56 - yeah but you have to be able to detach
82:57 - yourself from it Wow and maybe maybe
83:00 - what your idea of what the outcome could
83:03 - or should be yes I mean that that's
83:04 - brave that's that's courage yeah but I
83:07 - believe that given the right team even
83:11 - though it might not be exactly my vision
83:14 - now and I'm helping form that but I'm
83:16 - allowing them to be a part of forming
83:17 - that vision instead of me pushing it
83:19 - down
83:19 - no it could be more beautiful I don't
83:22 - know but I'm willing to take that risk
83:23 - right now yeah because uh I think it
83:27 - could be more beautiful it's gonna be
83:28 - different it might not be exactly how I
83:30 - would have done it but it could be
83:32 - better yeah but you have to trust those
83:35 - people you can trust the systems you've
83:37 - built yeah put in place yeah it's it's
83:41 - but it's cool now let me ask you are you
83:44 - when you're speaking with your team are
83:46 - you focusing more on the to-do list or
83:49 - are you focusing more in terms of
83:52 - empowering your team and management or
83:54 - are you focusing more on the outcomes
83:56 - with them so I'm focusing more my role
84:00 - and I have you know people who do coach
84:04 - development because I'm not good at
84:06 - coach development and actually I'm a I'm
84:08 - a good coach but I'm not a great coach
84:11 - and it's I could be but it's only for
84:15 - like an hour
84:15 - hmm right yeah and it's I can give
84:17 - everything I got it I can get super
84:18 - technical and I can do anything yeah but
84:22 - where I revert back to is I begin
84:24 - talking about philosophy nice and it's
84:26 - it's important but people yeah here they
84:29 - like that but they also have to be
84:30 - coached
84:31 - I need people with attention to detail
84:32 - some strategy and some tactical right
84:35 - and that goes for even coaching my
84:37 - coaches I can uh I can do it but I mind
84:41 - the optimal person to do that so my
84:43 - whole role with my staff is is leading
84:46 - them to pursue their purpose and
84:49 - continuing to readjust right what they
84:52 - do based on what they love what they
84:56 - light up while doing and in purgatory
84:57 - Wow and that's a constant shuffling and
85:00 - you know they evolve and they grow as
85:02 - you go so sometimes it's like oh god
85:04 - nobody wants to do X Y & Z and it's it's
85:08 - good to understand what those gaps are
85:10 - and continue to see those gaps rather
85:12 - than how people do them miserably just
85:16 - because it's part of their job or maybe
85:18 - it's because they don't want to let you
85:19 - down yeah maybe they're afraid to say
85:20 - something maybe they don't even know
85:22 - they're miserable yeah but you can see
85:24 - it and everybody else can see it yeah
85:25 - they're just stuck in this haze yeah of
85:27 - just doing and you have to pull them out
85:30 - so I call it like leading them to water
85:32 - and you know some
85:33 - making them drink by saying hey you're
85:35 - miserable doing this actually I see you
85:38 - light up while doing this let's figure
85:40 - out how to build your career around the
85:42 - things that make you light up yeah you
85:44 - might have to make a little sacrifice
85:45 - and and give up X amount of money in the
85:47 - short term yeah but here's where I think
85:49 - we can get and you're gonna be more
85:51 - fulfilled and you're gonna be happier
85:52 - yeah and it's really like making them
85:56 - believe in themselves yes and that's so
85:58 - important and I don't think I believed
86:00 - in myself until recently umm fully
86:04 - believed in myself hmm and it's it's
86:06 - once you do that you have to help other
86:09 - people do it Wow you know what I mean
86:11 - yeah yeah and making somebody believe in
86:14 - themselves sometimes it can be a scary
86:16 - thing like for example I shared with you
86:18 - the you know the recent friendship that
86:22 - kind of came not friendship didn't come
86:23 - to an end but the involvement in the
86:25 - business came to an end right and it was
86:28 - like me projecting my belief in that
86:31 - person yeah and putting that belief you
86:35 - know and kind of believing in that
86:37 - person but then I don't think he was
86:40 - ready to believe in himself yeah
86:42 - and sometimes that's a very that can be
86:45 - kind of a dangerous thing because you
86:46 - can lead them down this path where they
86:49 - were never meant to succeed or your son
86:53 - ever cause it kind of forfeit you're
86:55 - setting them sitting whatever fail or
86:57 - failure based on where they're at right
86:58 - now right mentally maybe exactly and you
87:01 - know as somebody who is you know an
87:03 - entrepreneur who romanticizes who finds
87:06 - the best in people and I feel like I'm
87:09 - doing a good job of finding the best in
87:10 - people and finding kind of even like
87:12 - what they're talented at but maybe not
87:14 - at this point good at understanding
87:16 - people yeah in terms of what would
87:19 - fulfill them years from now what would
87:22 - their ultimate vision be and so my
87:26 - struggle now is to kind of understand
87:28 - that about people where I can understand
87:30 - where things are gonna had six months or
87:32 - a year from now and what things they
87:34 - would find fulfilling yeah you know and
87:37 - I feel like you're you're doing a pretty
87:41 - good job at that
87:42 - no but it's through massive failing at
87:46 - it you know what it'd be a frequent and
87:48 - massive feeling in being introspective
87:50 - and you have I feel like you have to a
87:52 - certain level fail a little bit if you
87:54 - do learn it and I learned in the hardest
87:58 - way possible so the way the way we teach
88:05 - coaches to kind of figure this out is we
88:08 - have three circles Chevron yeah yeah I
88:10 - like drawing I love everybody loves me
88:12 - all right so we have three circles we
88:14 - have the classic Venn diagram of three
88:18 - circles so we have perfect day mm-hmm
88:20 - sorry okay then you have career goal
88:24 - so like monetary how much money you want
88:26 - to make and then strengths so like what
88:31 - we do is we try to find out where this
88:34 - is and we'll have less of the outer
88:36 - skirts right yes and then more of like
88:39 - okay well let's not even bother having
88:43 - you do things your miserable doing and
88:45 - really let's just focus on like getting
88:48 - here but maybe it starts by getting here
88:50 - first right yes maybe you're doing some
88:52 - things that you don't love to do but you
88:55 - don't necessarily be testing low then
88:57 - maybe that's just to make this right yes
88:59 - but eventually we want to eliminate
89:01 - these and we really want to get to here
89:03 - yeah so it's building their career plan
89:06 - based on that I love it and then so if
89:08 - you're if you're at point eight today
89:10 - and you want to get to point Z then you
89:13 - have to have benchmarks and stepping
89:16 - stones for them to get there and you
89:18 - have to visually show them that you're
89:20 - working with them to get there and
89:22 - you're always gonna constantly readjust
89:24 - at every point when you meet with them
89:26 - and say how are things going you know
89:28 - and it's a two-way street at that point
89:30 - they're vested in building their career
89:32 - yes it's not you telling them what to do
89:34 - they're choosing what they want to do
89:36 - and then they're building it around that
89:37 - and people are more fulfilled that way
89:39 - then they will ever be if you start with
89:42 - this dollar amount I need to make 70
89:44 - grand I will do anything to make 70
89:46 - grand that's not sustainable right it's
89:48 - not say no I absolutely
89:51 - how you said that when you're sharing
89:54 - this with the people or your team it's
89:56 - more outcome driven yeah I said I'd like
89:58 - to do list because and this is great I
90:01 - kind of had an epiphany just looking at
90:03 - this I feel like combining hello
90:04 - purgatory in heaven along with that
90:08 - outcomes that you want what people you
90:10 - figure out is like they can work in
90:11 - their own element based on this road map
90:14 - yeah and then because you're giving them
90:17 - - you're having them focus on outcomes
90:19 - rather than to do lists they'll come up
90:21 - with their own way to get that result
90:24 - and so they're becoming leaders and
90:27 - they're finding their biggest leverage
90:29 - points right you know and so they're
90:33 - gonna grow the business and themselves
90:35 - in the fastest way possible so I think
90:37 - this is a really great map and something
90:40 - I also want to share his life in the
90:42 - start you're kind of like when you were
90:46 - when you were saying everybody was
90:47 - pulling at you yeah and the start so a
90:50 - lot of people are like as a business
90:52 - owner you feel like you have to be doing
90:55 - everything yourself yeah except
90:58 - ultimately when the business grows to a
91:01 - certain level you want it so the
91:03 - business can run without you right and
91:05 - it's not because you're lazy and you
91:07 - don't want to do it it's so it's a real
91:09 - business well right and if you're sick
91:11 - you know like I was and I literally
91:13 - couldn't make content for a month yeah
91:15 - you know or if I'm going through like
91:17 - something you mope like somebody in the
91:18 - family died right where some emotional
91:20 - thing is happening I can't make content
91:22 - because I my energy is low the people
91:24 - who are watching is like Kazi why are
91:26 - you so sad right and I'm like but yeah
91:29 - well don't you understand what's going
91:31 - on in my life exactly like it's wrong
91:32 - with you and so then yeah there I'm I'm
91:34 - retaliating at that your defense I'm on
91:37 - defense and then it's creating like a
91:39 - hate relationship yeah then it's
91:40 - draining me every time I'm doing
91:42 - something that resentment right what is
91:44 - and then it starts building resentment
91:45 - and so basically you were you know here
91:49 - and you had all these other people
91:52 - around you who were who were kind of
91:55 - pulling on you yeah you know who were
91:58 - kind of pulling on you and this is the
92:00 - business in the start you know and if
92:02 - you any of you guys follow al
92:04 - Scharffen he talks about different
92:07 - levels of the business so you have
92:09 - between zero to $40,000 a year he calls
92:12 - it the seeker you're kind of just
92:13 - figuring things out between 40 to
92:15 - $100,000 in a year a year I believe he
92:17 - calls that promoter okay then there's
92:19 - one hundred and hundred to three hundred
92:21 - thousand dollars a year and then three
92:24 - hundred thousand to a million dollars a
92:25 - year where he's like you really need to
92:27 - pull yourself out of the business so you
92:29 - can work on the business rather than
92:31 - within the business right so ultimately
92:34 - what you want to be is like instead of
92:35 - all these people pulling on you you want
92:38 - to take yourself out of it and kind of
92:40 - be a person who's here and providing
92:44 - guidance to everybody when they need it
92:46 - but not like being being a bottleneck
92:50 - right so these people could work
92:52 - synergistically with themselves and the
92:55 - business could grow you know every day
92:59 - right right in their their incentive
93:01 - invested on growing it without you
93:04 - yes does it mean that you're not there
93:07 - for them that you're not gonna help them
93:09 - right but yeah like if you do everything
93:13 - chances are you doing everything at 20%
93:15 - of your capacity yes and that's poor yes
93:18 - in we've all been there but anybody
93:21 - who's working within their strengths
93:23 - that has eighty or a hundred percent of
93:25 - their capacity is gonna crush you at
93:26 - doing the house shoe and really it's
93:28 - more about if you're a business it's
93:30 - about consistency yes if you produce
93:32 - content it's not one great piece of
93:34 - content it's that drip of content where
93:37 - license they might see once but then
93:39 - they can expect you write like Rogan
93:41 - every week like a row dude he's a
93:43 - machine
93:43 - but he's built their reputation so
93:46 - service consistency matters everything
93:49 - is all about consistency yeah and if it
93:51 - relies on you chances are you're gonna
93:53 - screw up yes eventually yes or are you
93:55 - gonna just become miserable and become
93:57 - resentful different personality types
93:59 - exactly and so Rogen's personality type
94:02 - you know he's done taekwondo um he's
94:07 - done black belt in taekwondo jiu-jitsu i
94:09 - believe black belt and a lot of
94:12 - different types of martial arts and
94:14 - those really teach you that discipline
94:16 - to be able to
94:18 - work everyday without seeing any results
94:20 - right at all yep like YouTube you still
94:23 - see growth yeah business you still Steve
94:26 - Revenue all right members coming in a
94:28 - lot of these things you don't see any
94:30 - result like you don't know whether your
94:32 - skill has improved in writing but you're
94:34 - just doing it every freaking day and
94:36 - then that personality type and that
94:39 - discipline type carries over into
94:41 - something even like podcasts yeah you
94:43 - can do it every day whereas I will do it
94:46 - and I will be obsessed but then I'm like
94:49 - I want to do something different and
94:51 - impact people in a different way
94:52 - right so I don't see myself as being a
94:54 - good person who will be consistent over
94:56 - like forever every week yeah like that
94:59 - that literally makes me anxious me too I
95:03 - I mean - I need to have the freedom to
95:04 - create yes and maybe it's new things
95:07 - Rogen's interesting because he's built
95:11 - this podcast around being authentically
95:13 - himself no matter what right and I think
95:16 - that allows him to do it every day as
95:18 - frequently as he can where it does yeah
95:21 - when people are doing things that kind
95:24 - of have them shrink down to somebody
95:26 - they're not yeah because they're afraid
95:28 - of like how other people might perceive
95:29 - them of protecting a brand that they
95:32 - might work for yeah then yeah you're not
95:34 - gonna be able to do that all the time it
95:36 - kind of song he's gonna end up kind of
95:38 - like shrinking down rather than you
95:40 - being yourself right right yeah let me
95:43 - ask you so if you have that personality
95:45 - to where you want to change things and
95:47 - you say you work in obsessive cycles
95:49 - rather than like just one thing over and
95:52 - over again because you get bored how did
95:54 - you work on your body because body is
95:57 - something that takes discipline and like
96:00 - it's slow process and it requires
96:03 - consistency is like the most important
96:05 - thing for it right so you know right now
96:07 - what are you at eight or nine percent
96:09 - body fat
96:10 - yeah like eight Jesus that's that's
96:12 - incredible for anybody doesn't know
96:13 - about it eight percent is like you know
96:16 - super athlete levels so like how did you
96:19 - get to that and you know work on your
96:22 - body and have you know have the body
96:23 - that you've always wanted how did that
96:25 - happen
96:26 - so I was 30 pounds heavier than I am
96:30 - today when I found CrossFit I saw a
96:32 - picture of myself at my bachelor party
96:34 - in Miami in a pool shirt off and I was
96:36 - like what is going on here this is uh
96:38 - eight years ago in 2011 okay
96:41 - and I was wondering I'm like well why
96:43 - I'm spending two hours in the gym a day
96:46 - and this is before a CrossFit okay um
96:48 - what's going on it's not working this
96:50 - because I was doing the same thing over
96:51 - and over again so I can just describe
96:53 - what your body look like um I'll give
96:55 - you a picture okay plaster on here okay
96:59 - um and I wasn't happy I'm like why I
97:02 - have to do something drastically
97:03 - different so I joined CrossFit for the
97:05 - first time and it blew me away
97:08 - fell in love with it ever since now the
97:13 - mistake I made was being a tyrant to
97:16 - myself and I got really into CrossFit
97:22 - but I produced outcomes by kind of not
97:27 - loving myself and just beating the hell
97:29 - out of myself yeah and I became addicted
97:31 - to that and I saw resulting I know a
97:34 - thing or two about that yeah and this is
97:35 - physical this is via work this is
97:37 - anything um you know it's kind of like
97:40 - you're you're growing as a human being
97:43 - so I'm very similar to you where you
97:45 - would throw your back against the wall
97:46 - every time and then dig your way up in
97:48 - there there's some it's it's an
97:50 - addiction and it produces an outcome and
97:53 - usually a positive one but there's
97:55 - usually a cost down the road yeah now
97:58 - with CrossFit the same thing I would go
97:59 - six or seven days a week I was obsessed
98:01 - I'll just crush myself and as I learned
98:05 - more and as I opened my own gym and
98:07 - started seeing how it was that thing you
98:09 - said it's like pain I'm going to the gym
98:11 - and trying to like pay for your sins or
98:12 - something atone for your sins or just
98:15 - you know beat yourself up I love go to
98:18 - the dark place I see so many people
98:20 - doing that in again I use results so
98:23 - it's not bad it's better than nothing
98:24 - but from okay so in 2011 you saw that
98:28 - picture of yourself yeah and you were
98:31 - going in the gym at that time but you
98:33 - weren't getting the results you wanted
98:34 - and so after that you started beating
98:36 - yourself up so going to the gym
98:39 - not getting the results I wanted and
98:40 - like the Globo gym before cross but I
98:43 - signed up for CrossFit and I was just
98:45 - obsessed and within six months I lost
98:47 - thirty pounds I was ripped I I started
98:51 - eating like just meat and vegetables and
98:53 - in fat so I found a way to like hack the
98:57 - system get really lean feel really good
99:01 - but it was kind of like almost
99:03 - pathological where I wouldn't ever have
99:05 - like a bit of ice cream or I wouldn't do
99:07 - this and I went way extreme on the other
99:09 - end and then you know I was beating
99:11 - myself up in the gym just doing more
99:13 - work for because I thought more was
99:15 - better right now get better results if I
99:17 - just did more work as I learned more I
99:20 - started realizing like you can do this
99:22 - very intelligently and make it very
99:24 - sustainable and produce bigger and
99:28 - better outcomes with less suffering mmm
99:31 - yeah and when I realized that I had to
99:37 - teach other people that in but it's a
99:39 - very natural thing for people to want to
99:41 - work longer hours of work harder to get
99:44 - more results just like I was sharing
99:46 - with you where I'm like I don't feel
99:48 - good when I work less and make more
99:49 - money and right it doesn't sit well with
99:51 - me yeah yeah no there's absolutely
99:53 - nothing wrong with that correct yeah so
99:56 - we see it all the time play out now in
99:58 - the gym and like people doing
100:00 - competitor's programming thinking more
100:01 - is better the equation I use is if you
100:05 - create this to like the real world and
100:07 - in working it would be like working 52
100:10 - hours a week let's say for 70 grand and
100:15 - then compare that to working 25 hours a
100:20 - week for let's say 65 grand yes so
100:23 - you're working well more than half the
100:25 - amount yeah for almost the same outcome
100:27 - and it's probably more sustainable it's
100:30 - a healthier thing yes you yeah and it's
100:34 - not pathological and it's not being
100:36 - artificially held up by your will yes
100:38 - like just like brute force like I'm just
100:40 - gonna come in and crush myself every day
100:41 - yes so you know you're yes you're making
100:44 - five grand more but is that five Britain
100:45 - worth you know
100:46 - 22 more hours per week probably not you
100:48 - can you can take that 22 hours a week
100:50 - and probably make another 40
100:52 - 50 grand yes you know what I mean so
100:54 - teaching people that in Fitness it's
100:56 - very important teaching people that an
100:58 - entrepreneurship is very important as
101:00 - well it's the same lesson you can work
101:02 - hard but if you work smart and hard and
101:06 - then figure out how to work less you can
101:08 - yield bigger and better outcomes if your
101:11 - strategic enough right yes and if you're
101:14 - informed yes 100% and so for you once
101:18 - you kind of have that realization you it
101:21 - took you six months from 20 and 2011
101:24 - things changed for you yeah I'm kind of
101:26 - like body changed completely in six
101:28 - months
101:28 - yeah so 2011 going into 2012
101:32 - Wow yeah and then from there you started
101:35 - teaching this to people yeah oh yeah I
101:37 - was obsessed I'm like I have to share
101:39 - this this is this is what the world yeah
101:41 - trying to think of the date so if I got
101:44 - married in 2011 yeah it had to be 2011
101:47 - it's favored 1 2010 2011 Wow for me it
101:51 - was very similar with coding where I
101:53 - felt like I found a path yeah because I
101:56 - was like coding and I started generating
101:58 - a high five six figure or like a low six
102:01 - figure income with coding yeah without a
102:03 - degree right and I found it I learned it
102:07 - in a very simple way where people were
102:09 - like teaching you that people all over
102:12 - the internet are like you need this much
102:14 - math and otherwise don't even think
102:17 - about coding right and it was like that
102:19 - was a lie so many lies box I think drew
102:22 - yeah there's a box and like 30 years of
102:24 - experience before you can even think
102:26 - about making more than like 40 bucks an
102:28 - hour it was just like crazy lies or like
102:31 - limitations not even lies probably just
102:33 - limitations and I was like no there's
102:36 - like a much easier way I kind of got
102:38 - lucky finding it out yeah but whatever
102:41 - it's freaking awesome and I just want to
102:43 - share it yeah and then I got started on
102:44 - that path and I was like yeah like
102:47 - wanting to share and now I want to make
102:50 - it much bigger than myself yeah you know
102:52 - so that's kind of and what year was that
102:53 - when you first figured it out twenty
102:58 - 20:16 was where I kind of figured it out
103:01 - and 2017 like start was where I started
103:04 - the business right you know yeah so the
103:07 - business is really like one and a half
103:09 - year old I would say yeah that's awesome
103:11 - so I think people inside of the box
103:13 - don't know they're inside of the box yes
103:16 - and to them it's just like there's no
103:19 - shortcuts you just have to work hard
103:22 - logically here's the checklist go after
103:24 - it yes
103:25 - problem is I don't live in the box yes
103:28 - my brain doesn't operate there and when
103:31 - I'm there I'm miserable
103:32 - yes and I live on the fringes of the box
103:34 - and far outside the box yeah and I see
103:36 - things that other people don't see
103:38 - because of it yeah and it's not a
103:42 - shortcut it's a different way yes um so
103:46 - my brother cuz other people might see
103:47 - things you don't see either they when
103:49 - they're thinking logically it's like
103:51 - whoa I'd never thought about this for
103:53 - that I or I overlook certain things
103:55 - right right right but to be able to see
103:59 - things from outside of the box sometimes
104:02 - it's viewed as lazy yeah sometimes it's
104:05 - viewed as being unrealistic that's it
104:07 - lazier programmers are the best
104:08 - programmers yeah because it's like
104:09 - you're finding efficient ways to do what
104:12 - other people are doing it's again
104:13 - working more hours for the same outcome
104:16 - yeah why would you do that yeah if
104:18 - there's a different way and it might not
104:19 - be a way that people relate to yeah but
104:22 - that's like do you really think Richard
104:24 - Branson is working more hours than you
104:26 - right that why he's a multi de línea
104:28 - right the guy runs like 50 companies I
104:30 - think like some ridiculous numbers and a
104:32 - Elon Musk is like doing all this stuff
104:34 - like you really think he's working more
104:36 - they're like he's just doing more hyper
104:39 - efficient yeah like there and I think
104:40 - outside of the box
104:41 - yeah and they know how to leverage
104:43 - resources and people and bright ideas
104:45 - yeah and the world needs both cuz again
104:48 - if you're outside of the box sometimes
104:49 - you can't make things happen in reality
104:50 - yes but if you're in reality sometimes
104:54 - you're never gonna create beautiful new
104:55 - things because you're just doing the
104:57 - same thing right yeah and so that's why
104:59 - the best thing you can do with your time
105:01 - or to grow up business I feel like is to
105:04 - master yourself and
105:06 - master and then start understanding
105:08 - other people yeah you know never give
105:12 - the best leverage point you can ever
105:14 - lead anybody until you understand who
105:16 - you are
105:17 - otherwise it's literally just guessing
105:19 - right yeah yeah beautiful so know
105:22 - thyself
105:23 - I guess know thyself yes the number one
105:26 - thing that everybody needs to do boom
105:28 - there you have it any parting words or
105:32 - you think we covered good ground I think
105:35 - we covered a lot of ground we get help
105:37 - me sit here for another four hours and
105:39 - talk easy Sun is going down in Geelong
105:42 - oh yeah but yeah it's it's been amazing
105:44 - I'm sure we're gonna continue this
105:46 - conversation yeah outside of it yeah one
105:49 - parting thing that I'll leave you guys
105:51 - with the ancient Greeks there were seven
105:56 - sages that created hundreds of Maxim's
105:58 - or words to live by beautiful things
106:01 - above the pillars of the Oracle of
106:04 - Delphi
106:05 - there was only two things inscribed
106:08 - above the pillars number one was know
106:12 - thyself
106:13 - number two nothing in excess so if you
106:17 - can follow those two rules you can save
106:20 - yourself in the world from unnecessary
106:24 - suffering beautiful well that was
106:28 - awesome
106:29 - awesome thank you man I really
