00:00 - about three reasons why you should
00:02 - become a Python freelancer or a Python
00:05 - developer and let's hope that there are
00:10 - no more technical issues because we've
00:12 - been having technical issues for the
00:13 - last hour and the dashboard isn't
00:18 - loading and we sincerely hope that
00:21 - things don't crash but if they don't
00:24 - crash we're gonna be good to go okay
00:27 - okay we're alive you've got nine people
00:31 - on so far hopefully that increases a
00:34 - little bit awesome great and if the
00:39 - audio is working and you can just let us
00:41 - know that the audio is working that
00:42 - would be phenomenal so let's talk about
00:46 - why somebody should become a Python
00:49 - freelancer why do you think in mmm why
00:53 - should I stop in the world that's why
00:55 - the best job in the world what else
00:57 - that's a pretty big leap that's a good
01:01 - client I'd rather be like you know like
01:03 - a celebrity or something
01:05 - actually I would um I mean like any
01:08 - freelancer of course you have your own
01:10 - time you can work on your own time you
01:11 - can work from wherever you want why Kino
01:16 - I mean only like software freelancers
01:20 - alike or like online freelancers can
01:21 - work from wherever they want like you're
01:23 - just a free doctor in general sometimes
01:24 - you have to you're still like location
01:26 - about though because your developer plus
01:27 - a freelancer like that combination you
01:29 - can work from wherever you want whenever
01:32 - you want and the pay's I keep read that
01:34 - good and if I want to like coding is fun
01:37 - and like a badass or a half the
01:39 - time
01:42 - yeah okay hopefully these works so let's
01:48 - write some of these down okay so is he
01:57 - gonna let me write out there or do I
02:01 - just start typing okay there we go
02:08 - all right so let's let's change the size
02:12 - to make it like size 22 okay so why
02:23 - become a developer
02:29 - especially by becoming
02:33 - all over China's policy sparking yeah
02:38 - well use the bunch popped up we're at 44
02:40 - here oh wow
02:48 - you
05:56 - hello yep it's picking up okay great so
06:01 - the audio is back hello
06:04 - testing testing beautiful make sure
06:10 - you're in the camera so yeah
06:16 - just lean in and type all right see
06:21 - what's okay okay perfect sounds great
06:38 - sounds great
06:40 - where is the laptop right here sorry
06:45 - guys just setting a few things up so
06:46 - then the rest of the livestream can
06:48 - hopefully run a little bit smoothly all
06:52 - right so hopefully you guys can see me
06:56 - right now completely and can hear me
07:01 - completely so that would be great
07:06 - needed anymore
07:08 - awesome so for me the started was all
07:11 - about like income incoming income like
07:14 - that was my biggest goal right I would
07:18 - know they heard from the beginning
07:20 - they just weren't hearing for a little
07:22 - bit audience back beautiful okay thank
07:25 - you guys so for me it was like okay how
07:28 - much money do developers or Python
07:33 - developers make and I would I would look
07:36 - up things and I'd be like okay according
07:38 - to guru or Dax comm what are they making
07:43 - so all right average Python developer
07:48 - salary in the US and why is Python so
07:50 - popular
07:51 - the average Python developer salary in
07:54 - the US is 110 thousand dollars a year
07:57 - according to guru New York and
08:00 - California have the highest Python
08:03 - developer salary of 100 $22,000
08:05 - 200 $21,000 accordingly let's see if
08:10 - it's showing the correct thing great and
08:13 - then according to indeed the average
08:16 - Python programmer salary is 123 thousand
08:20 - dollars a year okay and these regions in
08:25 - the US are high color-coded by a salary
08:29 - so the purple you are the less income
08:35 - you make and apparently this is not even
08:39 - 90 K this is just less than $90 Oklahoma
08:44 - makes less than $90 so you have Oklahoma
08:51 - here then the other ones you got 90 to
08:54 - 100 K range the yellow ones are 100 110
08:58 - K and then the green ones like
09:00 - California Washington New York and
09:02 - Virginia are the hundred and 10k plus
09:05 - range basically no matter what yeah
09:10 - Python trends in 2019 and does it
09:14 - continue to be one of the hottest skill
09:17 - and I think they stole this from me
09:20 - actually yeah because I was the original
09:24 - one who I mean
09:26 - okay they could have not stolen it from
09:28 - me you know but my ego is coming in and
09:31 - I'm like because I did create a webinar
09:34 - once and I had this so Python is
09:37 - definitely one of the most wanted
09:39 - languages and this is according to a
09:41 - Stack Overflow post so it's not
09:43 - something that we're kind of coming up
09:45 - with here but Stack Overflow saves
09:49 - engineers all throughout the world
09:51 - billions of engineering hours which is
09:54 - very very helpful and according to them
09:58 - they're like hey you should probably
10:00 - learn Python because it's the most
10:02 - wanted or one of the most wanted ones
10:05 - the most
10:06 - yeah that looks actually fascinating
10:09 - what the hell yeah so they have all
10:14 - these programming languages starting
10:15 - from COBOL and I think that's all the
10:18 - way down here
10:19 - so binary there yeah so it's like more
10:21 - supplies all at the bottom and more
10:24 - demand as at the top so so the redder so
10:29 - it's like python is kind of getting in
10:31 - the redder area over here right yeah
10:36 - source dice another way to see the
10:40 - progress of Python is to study the pie
10:43 - pole popularity of programming language
10:45 - index there's also the Toby index which
10:48 - monitors the frequency of searches for
10:50 - different programming language tutorials
10:51 - in 2019 Python became the most popular
10:55 - programming language to learn showing an
10:57 - almost 17% growth over the last five
10:59 - years we probably had yeah I think so
11:07 - yeah we got a chunk of that yearling
11:09 - then Marsh jumped on it then everybody
11:12 - else jumped on it but okay look python
11:15 - trends or no not google trends right
11:23 - right yeah so last time I had it and we
11:28 - had JavaScript let's type in Python so
11:32 - I'm gonna search for programming
11:33 - language not just a search term the
11:35 - search term is a snake could be Python
11:38 - so we're gonna do a programming language
11:40 - and then we'll add in JavaScript here
11:47 - and if you look at the two over let's
11:54 - say deal interest and then over time it
11:56 - grew more and more and more interest and
11:59 - now it actually has a greater interest
12:03 - according to Google Trends and as a
12:06 - programming language okay see I think
12:22 - might actually be more popular but let's
12:24 - see let's see maybe it's not a lot of
12:29 - operating systems and low-level stuff is
12:31 - based
12:31 - see I mean Python is based on C C's not
12:36 - coming up plus me so we can look up C++
12:40 - but see oh god wait on there put
12:47 - lifetime I wanted I'm curious cuz like a
12:48 - long time ago like 2004
12:51 - maybe C++ was winning at the beginning
12:57 - Java Scott was killing it into the new
13:05 - Python is wait what other language II I
13:13 - mean Ruby might have more I mean
13:15 - actually I don't I don't think Ruby has
13:19 - Wow Wow okay let's look at Java oh my
13:35 - face is blocking a lot of it it's up
13:48 - there it's Java is fighting with
13:51 - JavaScript okay did I hide it I think I
13:59 - did finally right yo what's up Zaki yeah
14:08 - bottom right is yeah guys this is live
14:13 - what's up Shara's Anil Zaki fella
14:17 - Leo damn Leo why do you have so much
14:23 - hate against technically now all like
14:28 - hate comments and stuff like don't show
14:31 - them yeah oh dude I almost holy crap
14:36 - feel this I feel like I have the biggest
14:40 - paper cut that's ready to be feel it
14:44 - freaks they should freak me out man what
14:51 - happened how I like the craziest paper
14:54 - cut so that's kind of what's going on on
14:59 - this end right like you look at the
15:02 - trends now so you know the trends tell
15:05 - you a lot so you know let's go back and
15:17 - and I think the reason for that is
15:24 - Python just is so versatile you know
15:26 - like you can do web developer getting
15:29 - there's more and more businesses over
15:30 - time so there needs to be more web
15:32 - developers you can do machine learning
15:34 - with it and big data and there's more
15:36 - and more of that coming up as we go into
15:37 - the future and it's not gonna slow down
15:39 - and Python is a very very popular
15:40 - language if not the most popular for
15:42 - that it might be some like weird
15:45 - convoluted languages but I mean Python
15:47 - like you got like a lot of machine
15:49 - learning libraries and open some open
15:53 - source libraries for like doing this
15:54 - machine learning and big data kind of
15:56 - stuff so it's good for that and it's
15:57 - very easy to learn it's just it's just
16:00 - the most well-rounded language pretty
16:03 - much yeah right so you can you you can't
16:12 - while you can't do mobile right but what
16:15 - you would do with something like Python
16:17 - is for example if I wanted to build a
16:20 - iOS app I would use the Django like REST
16:28 - API and using that I wouldn't build the
16:33 - mobile app yeah because it actually
16:35 - turns out pretty nicely
16:36 - that's the mutable web apps - yeah
16:38 - because then it works on any toys yeah
16:40 - and I would use the Django REST API to
16:43 - make the backend and then I would just
16:45 - use flutter to create the front-end yeah
16:48 - and it would just query my API for all
16:51 - the data that it needs
16:53 - code daddy's list right
16:55 - [Music]
16:58 - yeah but we didn't news one yeah we
16:59 - didn't use flutter yeah but we did we
17:01 - also didn't create like a Django rest
17:03 - framework but like a HD I think yeah if
17:07 - we did create an API then we could use
17:09 - flutter or whatever we wanted right so
17:14 - the the Django back-end is pretty
17:16 - awesome so like for example while I
17:19 - can't exactly do mobile development but
17:22 - if you use the backend then it then it
17:28 - can do mobile you know maybe true I mean
17:44 - if you if you keep it separated it's
17:46 - easier to be more tailored because you
17:48 - can have like one mobile version and one
17:55 - native version but you can't say
17:59 - anything there we go
18:01 - okay okay guys everybody keep the chat
18:06 - clean cuz we're gonna block your face
18:11 - okay can you make an ecommerce website
18:14 - or an says so but ecommerce website yeah
18:18 - absolutely so let's talk about it right
18:20 - a commerce website with Python so can
18:25 - you make an e-commerce website with
18:28 - Python is there a website emoji we have
18:34 - so can you make an e-commerce website
18:37 - with Python you absolutely can it's
18:41 - let's talk about what are the things
18:43 - that you need to make a ecommerce
18:46 - website so what is something that you
18:48 - need well you're gonna need the backend
18:51 - to hold all of like the product data and
18:54 - the images and the prices and all that
18:57 - kind of stuff yeah Amit course back back
19:01 - you need a back-end which we can build
19:03 - with Python what else do we need so we
19:06 - need a we need a
19:07 - check how about like a add-to-cart type
19:10 - of functionality Oh like that kind of
19:12 - stuff like even getting even more yeah
19:14 - so we can do product listings yeah so
19:16 - like a list of products and on the back
19:20 - end you're gonna be need to be able to
19:21 - create an account you need to be able to
19:31 - accept payments what else we don't need
19:49 - the communication so like a regular
19:51 - regular websites like regular ecommerce
19:55 - websites you know there look through the
19:56 - products you Add to Cart there are
20:06 - already services for that you're not
20:07 - gonna create that from scratch so we can
20:11 - do product listings we can create an
20:13 - account payments cart what other things
20:16 - that we need to care about we're
20:17 - building ecommerce website security
20:25 - secure payments creating accounts
20:27 - securely other people can't log into
20:31 - your account and delete your listings
20:34 - right so an e-commerce website with
20:41 - Python well can we make product listings
20:45 - using Python yeah yeah so for some of
20:54 - this stuff you're gonna need HTML CSS
20:56 - for some stuff you might even need
20:58 - JavaScript but I'm all for most of this
21:00 - if you use Django you can actually build
21:01 - it the reason why we're fans of Python
21:04 - is because if it's flexibility not
21:06 - necessarily we're religious to it you
21:09 - know if it stops being practical I'm
21:12 - gonna stop talking about Python and I'm
21:14 - gonna be talking about the next
21:16 - programming language
21:19 - so we can do all of these things that
21:23 - you see here with Python so I will and
21:28 - and so yeah you can definitely build an
21:30 - app with you can definitely build an app
21:36 - with Python okay look at ecommerce
21:40 - website okay okay Zacky says I'm quite
21:56 - confused on how you're supposed to store
21:58 - account data and a webs in a database
22:01 - I usually just hash them is there a
22:04 - better approach so
22:06 - Zacky one thing I recommend in how do
22:10 - you use account data or how do you store
22:14 - people user data like how to store user
22:18 - data what I recommend for this is in
22:25 - Django try to use the built-in user
22:29 - model and try to use those built-in
22:33 - models as much as you can because they
22:36 - allow you to store that data without you
22:40 - having to do much and they do it
22:42 - securely so they'll they will hash the
22:45 - the passwords and everything for you and
22:49 - they will do a lot of those things
22:50 - automatically and then extend it as
22:52 - needed and that should do a pretty good
22:55 - job of keeping the data of user secure
23:07 - yeah tracking exactly or in yet tracking
23:10 - customer location is definitely helpful
23:13 - as well volume is is the volume low guys
23:16 - we can definitely turn it up yes hello
23:20 - hey guys hey hello hello okay so I think
23:26 - that should be enough to explode your
23:31 - ears
23:33 - rating the red stop chain development
23:38 - I am opting for blockchain to hold on I
23:40 - don't like this one okay also
23:43 - considering payments is it better to
23:46 - just interact with Visa or MasterCard
23:48 - API or should I use in middleware
23:50 - libraries such as stripe so for okay so
24:02 - when it comes to oh by the way we have
24:06 - our profitable programmer courses
24:08 - available we just opened it actually a
24:13 - few days ago and will be closing it when
24:16 - like two days three years in 17 hours
24:20 - okay so the early bird pricing ends for
24:23 - the profile programmer of course today
24:27 - at midnight so if any of you are
24:29 - interested in joining profitable
24:30 - programmer definitely check it out can
24:32 - you drop the link in the chat so people
24:34 - can see it and then we'll drop in the
24:35 - description too if you're watching this
24:37 - afterwards right I'll just put here to
24:49 - join profit oh yeah you can pin it no
24:57 - option - okay can you add it to the
25:00 - description of the chat probably not
25:02 - right you know what's funny is it says
25:04 - excellent connection and even with a
25:07 - dotter laptop it never said excellent
25:09 - connection I've never seen that okay so
25:13 - if you're using how - alright I'm just
25:18 - gonna write that right here
25:35 - let's see early-bird ends tonight yeah
25:43 - in like 17 hours yeah so if you if you
25:47 - want you can definitely look into this
25:49 - program or think about joining it but
25:51 - let's continue with everything we're
25:54 - talking about here so how do you
25:57 - actually so we've talked about how to
25:58 - store D how to store user data let's
26:01 - talk about how to accept payments in
26:07 - your Python app and really yes you could
26:12 - use middleware yes you could use the
26:15 - visa card and the MasterCard API but
26:18 - don't because that's why one of the best
26:24 - you know merchants ever were built was
26:27 - built which is stripe so use stripe and
26:35 - use PayPal API or something or oh yeah
26:42 - of course just put it in there yeah I've
26:44 - never actually used specifically stripe
26:47 - API so I have so like you have a stripe
26:52 - Python API right and so you just choose
27:00 - which one you want
27:02 - Python no just go
27:11 - okay and it's as simple as this to
27:14 - charge somebody right so you can charge
27:16 - a card it asks for some kind of specific
27:23 - you know key you give it API key and
27:26 - then you can save that charge so a
27:28 - specific charge ID and then there you go
27:30 - okay and that's how simple it is to get
27:35 - started with it I am actually using a
27:38 - stripe API for one of the apps I've
27:40 - built we just got 40 something I don't
27:51 - know what that is it's a thunderbolt
27:53 - currency the Superman currency okay so
28:00 - okay so what's 40 rupees
28:03 - I think that's 4 cents right 40 cents
28:06 - thank you so much I appreciate like
28:09 - really appreciate it thank you thank you
28:10 - that's amazing
28:13 - ok so let me continue thank you for that
28:15 - Nitin all right let's see what is
28:18 - happening yeah if you so if you don't
28:37 - have interested in coding then don't do
28:39 - anything with coding like stare oh wow
28:42 - chat revenue 56 cents it says right
28:45 - there dang I love that thank you guys ok
28:49 - so what's happening here I'm gonna go
28:53 - through some previous questions yeah
28:55 - there's actually I think you should
29:00 - think of so Abdul Salam says I think you
29:02 - should think of coding languages as
29:04 - tools some tools will be better at doing
29:08 - things than other tools just use what
29:10 - fits the screw head yeah so a lot of
29:16 - what you can think about when it comes
29:17 - to programming languages is that there
29:20 - are tools designed to help you ok it's
29:23 - not
29:24 - it's not that you have to be religious
29:26 - to one programming language it's more
29:29 - about okay figure out what's the tool
29:32 - that helps you what's something that
29:34 - helps you go farther maybe like for
29:36 - example if I'm building an applet Python
29:39 - but then I need to do mobile development
29:41 - right
29:43 - I might actually build that app out on
29:46 - my phone and then from my phone
29:50 - I can't be using Python so I'll build it
29:54 - using flutter right if I have to make my
30:00 - apps front-end really really good and
30:02 - make it really fast and have like
30:04 - capability to do Ajax and do all this
30:07 - stuff like I'm gonna use react or I'm
30:10 - gonna use something like JavaScript to
30:13 - maybe improve the interface so I'm not
30:17 - really religious to what programming
30:19 - language I use I try to use whatever is
30:23 - needed to do the job
30:24 - I just prefer I just prefer to be using
30:29 - Python wherever I can okay so hopefully
30:35 - that answers that question
30:40 - Pat ya pandas is a library yeah right so
30:47 - a data yeah it's you it's hard I mean
30:50 - you can use pandas with Django you know
30:52 - to do data analysis both yeah okay after
31:09 - learning object oriented programming and
31:12 - python cool projects woodtick inter is
31:14 - it good to jump to web development
31:16 - majang go yeah for sure so if you are
31:20 - doing if you did object oriented
31:21 - programming right object oriented
31:27 - programming
31:34 - and you know the answer is yes you
31:37 - should
31:38 - because object-oriented programming is
31:42 - really really like local development is
31:44 - really really good to get you the
31:45 - principles of how development works
31:47 - without having to deal with the
31:50 - complexity of the internet because
31:54 - you're not like if you're doing local
31:57 - development you're not worrying about
31:59 - hey like is my request working is my
32:02 - network working you're only yeah you
32:04 - know you're only what it's very you full
32:06 - control and everything's self-contained
32:08 - in its own and safe environment yeah
32:09 - yeah
32:10 - there's no exactly there's no other
32:12 - environment affecting you it's
32:14 - everything is self-contained so yeah we
32:21 - got a deal with this yeah and so this is
32:25 - the main thing when it comes to local
32:28 - development or just purely doing
32:31 - something on your desktop working with
32:34 - the web development so definitely take
32:36 - it one step at a time if you can Oh
32:40 - Kevin Roman is asking if you join the
32:43 - course in pay huh yeah so if you if you
32:51 - join the profitable programmer course
32:53 - it's 60 day money back but don't like
32:59 - don't jump in with the bad attitude
33:01 - because you won't do well so if you're
33:04 - gonna jump in like jump in fully on and
33:09 - and for in order for you to get a refund
33:12 - like you have to actually show you we're
33:14 - putting in work and week zero week one
33:16 - week two week three
33:17 - yeah because otherwise there will be no
33:19 - refund if you don't do the work like if
33:22 - you jump in just to like because some
33:24 - people will try to do that right they'll
33:26 - jump in to just look at the course or
33:29 - download the material so then they can
33:31 - use it for free and then they're like
33:33 - okay then they also get a refund on that
33:36 - and so we don't encourage those people
33:38 - to come in we encourage people who are
33:40 - serious about growing their business
33:42 - their income because otherwise don't
33:44 - jump in it's
33:45 - not helpful for you okay so what other
33:49 - question
34:17 - Zacky says i've seen that you learn
34:20 - libraries quite fast such as flutter do
34:25 - you do you just read the docs or what do
34:29 - you do I mean to be honest like I it's a
34:36 - mixture of a few things so one I just go
34:39 - through the basic tutorials of learning
34:42 - what I'm like I'm just you know like for
34:46 - example Oh Jango I went through the
34:51 - documentation what I did they have a
34:53 - tutorial there yeah so I followed a
34:56 - tutorial like a course or like an actual
34:59 - course yeah I followed a course and then
35:01 - I built the app that that person who's
35:03 - like what's his name coding for
35:05 - entrepreneur
35:08 - yeah he has really great courses on this
35:10 - on Jango and then I just followed his
35:12 - tutorials and then I went off and built
35:16 - my own stuff from his yeah that's the
35:19 - most important thing yeah like you can
35:20 - start on one spot like I think we you
35:23 - would start on one spot just to like get
35:24 - your feet wet but then after that like
35:26 - don't get something tutorial purgatory
35:28 - like trial codes like your own idea and
35:31 - then play around and figure it out
35:32 - yourself like piece by piece instead of
35:34 - just finally copying code off of a video
35:36 - and pasting it in and feeling good about
35:38 - yourself because you will learn that way
35:40 - but not nearly as fast as if you just
35:42 - like oh I have this idea like oh I want
35:44 - to integrate this into this ecommerce
35:46 - website payment thing well I want to
35:48 - make it secure you just look into it and
35:49 - you figure it out because that's
35:51 - actually what it's gonna be like when
35:53 - you're working on a real job you're
35:54 - gonna want to whatever your client is
35:57 - needing and asking for they're gonna be
35:58 - telling you they're gonna have a long
35:59 - list of things and you're gonna go
36:00 - through it and there's not gonna be a
36:01 - tutorial for you to go watch that exact
36:04 - project you gotta learn how to figure it
36:05 - out yourself so try to call with your
36:07 - own ideas that you enjoy that are like
36:08 - fun right and so yeah if you are
36:12 - building out like your own projects from
36:17 - following other people's tutorial that's
36:18 - one of the best ways to learn the new
36:21 - library or the new framework or whatever
36:23 - it is you're trying to learn I try to
36:25 - follow a tutorial that's very easy to
36:27 - follow and then I try to go and stem off
36:30 - from there
36:30 - my own thing so for example for flutter
36:33 - I was just using their their main
36:40 - tutorial which is on their platform so
36:44 - what you know and I was just following
36:48 - it literally from hearing gets started I
36:50 - made sure I set everything up I mean the
36:55 - amount of skill it takes just to install
36:59 - flutter and like start coding on it is
37:03 - actually remarkable like you I just I
37:09 - feel like so many people especially if
37:11 - you're new to coding like 99% of the
37:14 - people will fail and won't even get past
37:16 - like hello world on flutter really
37:20 - mm-hmm like just to get it started just
37:24 - to get it installed just to get it like
37:26 - working get everything set up it just
37:29 - takes so much effort but Python is like
37:38 - right and I and I wish repli'd has
37:40 - something on flutter because repli'd is
37:42 - great but I don't think they have I
37:46 - don't think they have anything on
37:49 - flutter no don't they even have stuff on
37:55 - react they got stuck on know I guess
37:59 - stuff on no GS but they don't have
38:02 - flutter yet so I will how do I learn
38:10 - frameworks
38:26 - okay that's mainly that's mainly what I
38:30 - do
38:30 - okay guys I'm a freelancer in a
38:36 - completely different field that's fun
38:37 - and rewarding sometimes but I just feel
38:40 - like I'm ready to try something new a
38:41 - question is it too late to start in your
38:43 - 30s almond ass so it depends but we have
38:51 - like us are our student his name is
38:53 - Donnie and he's always gonna be too late
38:55 - and it's always that extent reason for
39:00 - almost whatever it is that you do will
39:02 - always be there but if you if you want
39:05 - to put into perspective you know
39:08 - somebody who's 15 doesn't start like I
39:11 - remember I didn't want to start working
39:13 - out at 15 because I thought it was too
39:15 - late cuz there were kids who are working
39:18 - on since 12 and they were already so
39:20 - much better athletically than I was so
39:23 - at 15 I didn't work out I was the same
39:26 - way actually yeah yeah my friends
39:31 - working out for three years like I'm so
39:33 - skinny
39:33 - and then like 17 18 19 you finally start
39:39 - in the gym and then you're like at some
39:41 - point like you know the hodgetwins you
39:44 - got yeah I don't know if you guys are
39:46 - filming with the fitness but there's
39:47 - these two guys called the hodgetwins
39:48 - they're super funny they're Fitness guys
39:50 - and they're super jacked they didn't
39:52 - start working out until they're like 24
39:54 - but now they're like 30 and like ripped
39:56 - as hell yep I didn't know that I didn't
39:58 - know that they didn't start working out
39:59 - till they're 24 or like some I don't
40:02 - know the exact number but it's a
40:04 - surprising age you would like I assume
40:06 - they started when they're like 18 yeah
40:08 - when did the Hodge Tunes start
40:16 - I'm video there these are the guys to
40:23 - million subscribers we got two new yeah
40:26 - they're doing like comedy shows now cuz
40:28 - they're funny
40:30 - Kevin Hodge
40:36 - think of them as a Blair Witch Project
40:38 - of the fitness world that's funny
40:47 - yeah back workout routine okay I can't
40:52 - see oh there 42 now yeah
40:57 - lift smart not big yeah so it depends
41:01 - when do use when you start it's a good
41:05 - question to think about but most
41:07 - important is like income from it would
41:09 - it be worth it for you would you enjoy
41:11 - it that's the question you should ask
41:13 - yourself and if you would then it's
41:15 - worth it to actually jump on and start
41:18 - on this right then you should go and
41:21 - jump on and be like I'm gonna start
41:23 - coding now and by the time 31 32 33 I
41:27 - will have this skill because the
41:30 - alternative is that you just won't have
41:32 - to skill right is it too late yeah too
41:37 - late to become unstoppable over by 33
41:38 - but not by 35 exactly so it's too late
41:41 - if you think it is it's also not too
41:43 - late if you don't think it is so
41:46 - thinking three to five-year terms you're
41:48 - very young 30 is very very young because
41:52 - you could be 40 and you still have
41:55 - another lifetime ahead of you another 40
41:58 - years another 40 years ahead of you you
42:00 - know so it's not late at all
42:12 - passive income with Python making
42:17 - licensed softwares
42:21 - where this one anyways to make passive
42:26 - income with Python making licensed
42:28 - software's writing blogs yes there's
42:30 - ways to make quote unquote passive
42:32 - income with everything except what you
42:35 - think about is passive income is not
42:38 - passive income so there is no such thing
42:43 - as passive income and the reason why I
42:48 - see that is because people think passive
42:52 - income is equal to easy income and
43:00 - there's no such thing as this it's it
43:03 - doesn't exist there's no because I mean
43:08 - if you're talking about making a license
43:10 - to offer essentially you're talking
43:11 - about almost like a SAS so if we're
43:13 - building a software as a service with
43:15 - Python
43:15 - there's no passive in it like you're
43:18 - gonna build it you're gonna be updating
43:20 - it and then you're gonna be doing it
43:22 - over and over again it's very rare that
43:26 - you actually build something that
43:27 - generates some kind of real income
43:29 - that's actually useful right like
43:31 - technically talks about some software
43:33 - that he's built but he made he makes
43:35 - such little money from it it's might as
43:37 - well have not built it in the first
43:39 - place yeah he created like some kind of
43:44 - like photography like stitching thing
43:48 - and then it brings in like how much does
43:51 - it bring in time like not as much as you
43:53 - would think yeah I I can't remember it
43:55 - exactly but this was like three years
43:57 - ago
44:06 - right so let's see contrary so there's
44:10 - some so yeah I don't know does he have
44:12 - it in because I don't to go through the
44:14 - whole video panel opps right there yeah
44:17 - yeah so panel apps is one tool that he's
44:20 - built there's some other tool and then
44:28 - I'm not exactly sure what this is image
44:34 - details
44:35 - I think it's panel apps images like you
44:37 - can how much earnings he gets yeah
44:39 - people can like input their like a video
44:42 - or something and then it spits out an
44:43 - image of that video into image form so
44:46 - yeah upload a video and then it just
44:47 - gives you back an image right
44:51 - yeah so you can like if you again if you
44:56 - build a lot of these applications even
44:58 - this application that he's built with
45:01 - panel apps or whatever it is like you're
45:05 - not actually making that much income
45:08 - without having to do any work at all
45:11 - like you have to update it you have to
45:13 - make sure that it's running you have to
45:15 - make sure it's something that people are
45:16 - using and if somebody else makes that's
45:19 - the same thing that you're looking to
45:21 - build well then you're not gonna get
45:23 - paid for what it is that you have right
45:26 - so there isn't any kind of passive as in
45:30 - you do it and then you're just kind of
45:32 - out but for sure you can build licensed
45:36 - software right like JetBrains makes
45:40 - PyCharm and I use pycharm and I pay
45:43 - JetBrains for the service of PyCharm and
45:46 - then lots of companies purchase pycharm
45:48 - and use it as well
45:51 - oh hi Isabelle sang hi yeah she's on
46:04 - Team clever programmers
46:07 - volume is still too low huh I don't
46:12 - believe I'll be on their side yeah it's
46:13 - probably check your mic or something
46:15 - Matt I mean your your headphones
46:17 - whatever your speakers yeah better to
46:20 - store right now with Python thanks for
46:22 - answering yep you got it right
46:32 - so I'm also a Jenga developer without a
46:36 - degree
46:36 - so yeah you it could be helpful for you
46:40 - but if you are trying to do freelancing
46:43 - and you're trying to become a software
46:45 - developer it's not necessary like
46:47 - experience experience Trump's degree no
46:50 - matter what it's it's just because your
46:52 - degree could give you experience that's
46:54 - like right and like resources but I mean
46:57 - you can get it from anywhere so it
47:00 - doesn't really matter if you have a
47:01 - degree right if you have the experience
47:03 - in the knowledge in the last two years I
47:06 - just broke 1 million dollars in the last
47:10 - two and a half years and I don't have a
47:14 - college degree so I'm I have a very bad
47:19 - GP I had a bad GP in Oakton community
47:21 - college I had a 2.0 GPA in Oakland
47:23 - Community College I got a 19 on my CT a
47:26 - lot of my friends around me were like yo
47:28 - even monkeys would get a big break
47:31 - $1,000,000 in the last two and a half
47:35 - years and you know if you look at the
47:38 - timeline 2015 I learned how to code 2014
47:43 - I learned how to code then 2015 I was
47:45 - making about sixty to seventy thousand
47:48 - dollars in a year then twenty you know
47:53 - twenty sixteen I made let me let me
47:55 - write this down I guess so 2015 learned
48:00 - 2014 learned coding 2015 did about 60 K
48:11 - something like that 60 k TK something
48:14 - like that 2016 I did a hundred and four
48:20 - K at that year and then 2017 I did
48:28 - 211 K about 2018 350 K and then 2019
48:39 - we've already done turn fifty K and
48:42 - we're probably on track for five four
48:46 - hundred five hundred maybe but we'll see
48:48 - so on track for you know four hundred K
48:53 - plus right so if you just actually add
48:57 - up the last two and a half years that's
48:58 - over a million dollars but it all
49:01 - started from learning the skill of
49:04 - coding so I learned to code and then I
49:07 - started making income now I don't have a
49:11 - college degree I am NOT planning on
49:15 - getting a college degree
49:17 - but I just know that I have a goal I
49:21 - have a vision and then I just execute on
49:24 - it you know so when it comes to like I
49:27 - learned the skill set of coding and the
49:30 - first things that helped me make my
49:32 - income were you know first I made my
49:40 - income from teaching coding and that
49:47 - helped me get to about 80 K close to 80
49:50 - K year and then the second thing was
49:57 - freelance with code and that helped me
50:01 - get to 100k plus a year and then it was
50:09 - I realized that there's so much demand
50:12 - for coding and then I started teaching
50:13 - coding and so that could be the next
50:16 - step for somebody who's wants to become
50:18 - a developer right you could first learn
50:22 - coding then you could teach it to other
50:23 - people and charge for it then you can
50:25 - freelance with coding and then you could
50:28 - actually teach coding at scale right so
50:31 - teach coding online is what helped me
50:35 - scale to over 300 K plus a year
50:41 - so because if you're teaching coding
50:44 - online and you're helping other people
50:48 - become freelancers and other people
50:50 - become developers well you're helping
50:53 - many many different people throughout
50:54 - the world and so then it only makes
50:57 - sense that you're making a higher income
50:59 - and you have a bigger impact in the
51:01 - world you make more income and you have
51:03 - bigger impact but you know it's if I go
51:10 - here all started in 2014 with me
51:18 - learning to code you know as it's it's
51:24 - it's that were should anyone registered
51:33 - to teach coding and how yeah so there
51:47 - are lots of different platforms you
51:49 - could be using right you could be using
51:50 - up work or wise aunt or take lessons and
51:54 - those are all platforms you could use to
51:57 - register and apply and those are those
52:00 - are great ok those are great platforms
52:14 - you got a bro to do freelance without
52:18 - davina Python
52:23 - did you web dev just yeah learn Python
52:25 - and Django start there yeah start with
52:29 - Python and Django and then you'll be
52:31 - well on track she's yeah team member and
52:36 - a regular spectator how to turn ideas
52:40 - into real-world applications well you
52:43 - want to code something up and then you
52:46 - want to make it you know coded like I
52:55 - don't know what I don't know what that
52:57 - means
53:01 - you code it and then it's in real world
53:04 - you know yes I think I think you should
53:08 - take your idea and define it in how it
53:10 - could be coded like if you're gonna do
53:12 - this thing that does this crazy thing
53:15 - blah blah will like break it down into
53:16 - pieces and then implement all those
53:18 - pieces like I mean you could you can
53:21 - pretty much implemented you're not gonna
53:26 - like program like the Ironman suit or
53:30 - something but just write applications I
53:38 - mean just break it down into parts and
53:41 - then go from there bringing out the
53:43 - smallest parts possible so like we said
53:45 - with the e-commerce website like oh how
53:47 - do I make ecommerce website
53:48 - okay well then break that down into like
53:51 - you need to be able to see images you
53:52 - know prices to handle payments to handle
53:55 - security and privacy how like accounts
53:57 - and logging in stuff just like
53:58 - amazon.com like think like look at
54:00 - amazon.com yeah it's just as simple as
54:06 - that
54:07 - alright so that is it guys for us for
