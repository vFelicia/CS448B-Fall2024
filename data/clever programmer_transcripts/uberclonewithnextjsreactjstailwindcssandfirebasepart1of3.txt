03:59 - going to be building today all right so
04:01 - we're going to be building uber
04:03 - and you guys are going to be building
04:04 - these screens all right so that's a
04:06 - login screen with full user
04:08 - authentication
04:09 - once you log in you get to view the
04:12 - entire app and you can choose whether

08:44 - all right what do you guys think drop it
08:46 - down the chat in the chat well open up
08:48 - the terminal so for you guys open up
08:51 - your command line or terminal okay
08:53 - that's the first thing that we're
08:54 - actually going to go ahead and do here
08:57 - and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
09:00 - go into a folder so i just like to go
09:02 - into a folder called github that i have
09:05 - okay you don't need to go into any
09:06 - folders you can stay exactly where
09:08 - you're at okay yes
09:10 - and then
09:12 - what we want to do here is we want to
09:14 - type in a command
09:15 - all right and this command is a simple
09:17 - command that allows you to install
09:21 - this next project yeah let's install
09:24 - this project okay
09:25 - so so what you guys want to do is do npx
09:28 - it's called it is called npx create next
09:31 - app that's right npi create dash next
09:34 - app and then you do at latest
09:36 - yep so we're gonna do just like this
09:39 - cool now to how to be able to make this
09:41 - work you have to have npm installed and
09:43 - as we said yesterday you have to have
09:44 - npm installed so hopefully you guys got
09:46 - that installed yeah or notes installed
09:48 - sorry and you can try it and if you
09:49 - don't have it installed you can install
09:51 - it of course later on as well okay even
09:53 - after this video like if you at any
09:55 - point you just can't keep up and you're
09:57 - trying your hardest and you're like just
09:58 - getting frustrated you can just watch
10:01 - okay
10:02 - i would say keep trying to code along
10:04 - with us and if you just can't some point
10:06 - you can just watch all right and make
10:08 - sure you're kind of getting it that's
10:09 - the whole that's the whole idea
10:12 - okay cool and what's your project name
10:14 - i'm just gonna call it uber next
10:17 - clone
10:18 - okay just like that
10:20 - and i'm going to hit enter and now you
10:22 - see it's saying installing react react
10:24 - dom and next
10:27 - nice this is looking good
10:30 - yes on eslint so your sled is going to
10:32 - be for cleaning up your code
10:34 - yes
10:35 - uh if you guys have trouble with like
10:37 - hey what is um you if you said cd github
10:40 - and it didn't work that's okay that that
10:42 - command only works for me because i have
10:44 - a folder called github if you don't have
10:46 - that folder you don't even need to type
10:48 - in cd github you can just type in that
10:50 - npx command that we showed you
10:55 - beautiful next thing we want to do is we
10:57 - want to open up vs code and open open up
11:00 - our project cool
11:01 - so now i'm gonna go ahead and
11:05 - we're gonna i'm gonna open it up in my
11:08 - uh
11:09 - via cs
11:11 - beautiful okay
11:14 - if you want the the command let me go
11:16 - and get you the command npx create next
11:18 - app right here i got you
11:20 - boom
11:21 - okay
11:22 - so i just basically went into my vs code
11:25 - and i picked that folder all right so if
11:27 - i were to show you guys how you would do
11:30 - this
11:31 - is you would go to whichever folder you
11:33 - put it in here i'm going to click uber
11:35 - next clone
11:36 - and then i'm just going to hit open in
11:38 - my vs code and it's going to open that
11:40 - up right here okay
11:44 - beautiful
11:45 - and uh i'm gonna make nas and me a
11:48 - little bit smaller because i think we're
11:50 - taking up over like too much of the
11:51 - screen it's gonna
11:53 - stop you guys seeing
11:55 - some of the coding action that's
11:56 - happening so that's gonna be mad
11:59 - yeah
12:01 - okay awesome so i think uh that's good
12:04 - and now i'm gonna give access to nas so

13:36 - freaking out it's all good just watch
13:38 - along and you're gonna start getting it
13:40 - and picking it up
13:41 - uh
13:43 - cool
13:46 - somebody's like yeah the terminal is
13:47 - taking a long time to upload yeah
13:49 - that'll happen sometimes
13:52 - uh is this not working for you bro i got
13:54 - it i got it it's just taking some time
13:56 - okay thank god whoo
13:58 - are you in
13:59 - yeah yeah yeah i should see okay because
14:02 - it to me just says zero participants
14:05 - give me one second uh joined
14:08 - hey let's go and can you okay great so
14:11 - we've got that guys right we've got our
14:14 - application we've got two things we've
14:16 - got of course in the top left if you
14:17 - want to look at it if we don't do a
14:20 - shared server just yet let's not do that
14:21 - just yet let's go back to our file
14:23 - structure okay
14:25 - and you can see there's two there's a
14:26 - few things we've got we've got the pages
14:28 - folder we've got the public folder right
14:30 - there and we also got even uh what we've
14:33 - got the styles folder that's right the
14:36 - one that we're going to be working with
14:37 - right now is going to be the pages
14:38 - folder so if you go to the pages folder
14:41 - right there yeah and if you simply open
14:43 - up index.js so i feel like a bunch of
14:46 - people are asking what was the first
14:48 - step so let me just show it because i
14:50 - think bunch of people are getting stuck
14:51 - there so uh
14:54 - a lot of you guys are saying what was
14:55 - the first step so the first step was
14:57 - this we typed in literally the first
14:59 - thing you need to do
15:01 - right is i'm just going to go here and
15:03 - clear this up so it's clear
15:06 - the first thing that you're going to do
15:07 - is this npx create next app at latest
15:12 - just like that
15:14 - and that's going to install everything
15:15 - for you if this gives you errors this
15:17 - just means you don't have node installed
15:19 - the right way and make sure you have it
15:21 - installed the right way and then
15:22 - everything will work
15:23 - yes okay
15:25 - awesome
15:26 - um and then you essentially open that
15:29 - folder so this will create an app for
15:31 - you then you create then you open up
15:32 - that folder in visual studio code
15:36 - all right okay all right let's keep
15:38 - going nas
15:39 - beautiful okay
15:40 - after that
15:41 - we want to do is we want to open up the
15:43 - terminal here so you can do
15:45 - open terminal all right here we go
15:49 - there we go and you can do npm
15:52 - space fun space dev
15:56 - all right
16:00 - there we go beautiful so looks like
16:02 - you've got we've got us a and now you
16:04 - want to open this one up
16:06 - okay here we go
16:10 - there we go open up let me zoom out
16:13 - all right so this is if you are able to
16:16 - get to this point you have your very
16:18 - first
16:19 - uh react slash next app up and running
16:22 - okay so congratulations if you've made
16:24 - it or if you haven't made it it's okay
16:26 - you can rewatch it and make it up to
16:28 - here
16:28 - yes yes yes yes so at this point guys
16:31 - this is your first
16:32 - application right it's the starter
16:34 - application but of course we're going to
16:36 - modify this now okay so if we go into
16:39 - our pages folder and if we go in to our
16:42 - index.js
16:44 - yeah we can do that right now okay so
16:47 - let's go into pages folder and let's go
16:49 - into index
16:50 - beautiful
16:52 - okay
16:53 - and you can see that there's all of
16:55 - these things we've got the head we've
16:57 - got the main
16:58 - and this is literally like html except
17:01 - just to give you guys some context in
17:03 - next gs react.js it's actually called
17:06 - jsx which is basically html but for
17:09 - javascript okay so just has a different
17:12 - name okay yeah now we're going to do
17:14 - first is we need to remove all of this
17:16 - in terms of remove everything from head
17:18 - where you see the head and i'm going to
17:19 - go all the way down i'm going to remove
17:22 - all the way down to the footer right
17:24 - here so we don't need all any of this
17:26 - stuff right here okay this is what your
17:27 - file should look like after you're done
17:30 - exactly exactly then you want to go
17:32 - ahead and click save right and at this
17:34 - point your application should look like
17:36 - nothing i'm going to go i'm going to go
17:38 - ahead and open up my localhost so i can
17:40 - see what i'm seeing from your site
17:42 - beautiful and inside here which you can
17:44 - just say stuff like for example you know
17:46 - i can say the header right and if you
17:49 - run this if you save this
17:51 - it should technically show the header
17:52 - for you right there okay yeah so now if
17:55 - you look at our application right now
17:56 - let's go back to our application okay uh
17:59 - the pre-built one the right the one
18:01 - that's already been built let's go ahead
18:02 - and sign in with google kazi
18:05 - all right
18:07 - and what do we see
18:09 - go sign up with google
18:13 - now when i see applications guys i see
18:16 - what i see boxes literally in life your
18:20 - life is made of small boxes in terms of
18:22 - coding wise okay so if you see a box
18:24 - here what are some boxes do you see
18:26 - right here guys okay let's think about
18:28 - this well we've got one box that's the
18:30 - map
18:31 - okay and then we got another box that's
18:33 - going to be the bottom section right
18:35 - that's going to be the that's going to
18:36 - contain your buttons going to contain
18:38 - your header
18:39 - everything right so the reason why i do
18:42 - that and this is very very important is
18:45 - because this allows me to build html
18:47 - structure remember how we said that html
18:49 - is like a bonus right well i'm literally
18:52 - looking and how the bones are built
18:55 - right just by looking at it like that
18:57 - okay so if we have the map you can see
18:59 - i'm gonna go and create create this div
19:01 - called map
19:03 - div right here and inside here i'm gonna
19:05 - say map right that's gonna be my fault
19:07 - my first thing yeah and that i'm going
19:09 - to say here
19:11 - div right here and i'm going to say i'm
19:13 - going to call this the let's just say
19:15 - the start section okay
19:18 - boom so you can see if we go back to our
19:20 - application we have two things map and
19:23 - start yep all right beautiful and there
19:25 - are two like little boxes
19:28 - yeah they're just two little boxes and
19:29 - i'll show you exactly why they're how
19:31 - they are little boxes
19:32 - if i go back to my uh
19:35 - css actually it's uh inside the home the
19:37 - mod of the css you could click on that
19:39 - one maybe maybe you can follow my code
19:41 - can you click follow me somehow or no
19:43 - yeah i can
19:44 - i'm following you
19:49 - yeah is it good yeah yeah okay beautiful
19:52 - all right so if i go back i'm going to
19:53 - go back minus the js i'm going to give
19:55 - this a class name yeah
19:58 - for now
19:59 - and because i just want to show you
20:00 - exactly what we're looking for right i'm
20:02 - going to call it styles
20:04 - dot let's just call it a map
20:07 - yeah and inside this day i'm gonna say
20:09 - class name
20:11 - is equal to right here
20:13 - styles dot start okay right there's and
20:17 - we we give this like class name because
20:20 - remember in order for us to style
20:21 - something we need to have a class name
20:24 - okay yeah i go back to my home damage
20:27 - that's my module.css and i will actually
20:30 - create those so like i said we created
20:32 - the map one boom
20:34 - and then we're gonna create the start
20:37 - one right like so
20:40 - okay i will go ahead and create a
20:41 - background color
20:43 - here and i'm gonna call it a red
20:47 - yeah right right you guys can see right
20:48 - away right we've got the red color if i
20:50 - go to start i'm going to give this a
20:52 - background color
20:53 - of what green
20:56 - oop not green green no
20:58 - beautiful right so now we've got those
21:00 - two things right now let's think about
21:02 - okay how do we now make sure that all
21:04 - this you see remember how we built these
21:06 - two boxes one top and one bottom right
21:09 - so how do we make it in a way where they
21:12 - fill up the whole screen
21:14 - that's an interesting portion right
21:16 - well this is where we have a height for
21:19 - example if i go to my container here and
21:21 - i say height
21:23 - i can say 100 vh okay and check this out
21:26 - this is called 100
21:27 - vertical height pay attention i'm going
21:30 - to give the background color let's just
21:31 - say uh background background color oh
21:34 - let's just say blue for now so you guys
21:36 - can see exactly what i'm talking about
21:38 - oops blue
21:40 - beautiful
21:42 - there we go you guys can see so without
21:44 - this height of 100 vh basically nothing
21:47 - will happen and it will just be like
21:49 - this
21:49 - yeah you see but if i say a height of
21:52 - 100 vh
21:54 - now is the full height yeah yeah okay
21:57 - now how do we make sure that this all
21:59 - these now take up the same amount of
22:01 - screen real estate this is where we you
22:04 - use something called display flex and
22:06 - you can know this down somewhere you
22:07 - know somewhere in your notepad but
22:10 - flexbox is a very important tool you're
22:12 - going to use just in general as a
22:14 - developer right it's what is what allows
22:16 - us to create like structures you know
22:18 - like facebook for example uses flexbox
22:20 - netflix uses flexbox everybody uses
22:22 - flexbox to be able to structure things
22:25 - yeah so if i could display flex here
22:28 - boom
22:29 - beautiful
22:30 - after that okay don't worry don't worry
22:32 - don't worry both faces in a second here
22:33 - we'll say flex direction you change
22:35 - direction to b column
22:39 - right here column and now it's column
22:42 - flex direction and now what i'm going to
22:44 - do
22:45 - is because of this i'm going to give my
22:47 - map a flat and i'm explaining this a
22:49 - second here flags of one
22:51 - boom
22:52 - right you see will take up a lot of
22:54 - space and then i say start
22:56 - also guys flags of one
23:00 - boom
23:01 - so what just happened here
23:03 - right remember basically what we did is
23:06 - we gave our map so our map right here we
23:09 - give this you know
23:10 - when i say flex of one it means
23:12 - basically
23:14 - the weight the importance of that div
23:16 - that container
23:18 - and then our start also has the same
23:20 - weight or the importance so if they both
23:23 - have the same you know the same amount
23:25 - of weight that means they will what
23:27 - they'll be split 50 50. correct yes or
23:30 - no yeah 50 50. yeah right if i give the
23:33 - start of 0.5 check this out what do you
23:36 - think will be smaller right if i say 0.5
23:39 - what do you think yeah the star one
23:41 - let me ask you this what if i say this
23:42 - is flex 0.5 then which one will be
23:45 - smaller here's my question to you
23:47 - dropped in the chat i'm really curious
23:49 - which will be smaller if i put flex 0.5
23:52 - for the map which one
23:54 - hey that's a good that's a good one guys
23:57 - exactly it will be the same so if i
23:58 - flick 0.5
24:00 - i'm saying
24:01 - they are the same importance got it so
24:04 - guys this is what we created on this
24:06 - point right it's all good and dandy
24:08 - that's exactly what we want but of
24:10 - course it's not application
24:12 - the next thing i'm gonna do guys is the
24:13 - following i'm gonna go back to instags
24:16 - and what i want to understand is yes
24:18 - this is not the uber clown at this point
24:22 - but because i don't want to go further
24:24 - using css at this point we're done using
24:26 - css
24:28 - we're going to be using now styled
24:30 - components
24:31 - what i just showed you just one way to
24:32 - create styles which is an amazing way
24:35 - but now what i'm going to show you is
24:36 - how do we create style components use
24:38 - style components to create amazing css
24:41 - ready for this
24:42 - ready quasi yeah let's do it beautiful
24:45 - all right so the first thing we're going
24:46 - to create is we need to install tailwind
24:50 - css okay can you or can you go to google
24:53 - please and type in uh tailwind css
24:57 - or tailway style components there we go
24:59 - yep so
25:00 - if you type in tailwind
25:03 - uh
25:04 - tailwind style components right is that
25:05 - what you said that's right
25:08 - tailwind styled components here we go
25:12 - cool
25:13 - yes
25:14 - let's click the first one
25:16 - that's what i'll do
25:17 - that's we're going to use
25:19 - then you guys want to go ahead and
25:20 - scroll all the way down
25:22 - go all the way down and there's the
25:24 - install
25:25 - not all the way down sorry that's two
25:26 - that's too much let's go a little bit up
25:28 - now this is the one right yeah now
25:30 - scroll up a little bit more scroll up
25:32 - uh-huh
25:36 - up stop stop stop stop stop
25:39 - right here scroll a little bit down
25:41 - and there you will see so if you scroll
25:43 - yeah they go beautiful if you scroll and
25:44 - then you see how this is the code you
25:46 - want to run but we're not going to run
25:47 - this just yet because we need to install
25:49 - tail and css separately so there's a
25:51 - button there tail and css you see that
25:53 - button it says install tail and css in
25:55 - the little
25:57 - font that's italic
25:58 - it's like italic font on the bottom on
26:00 - the bottom uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
26:02 - let's see there we go cool so i'll click
26:04 - that
26:05 - beautiful and then you guys can just
26:07 - even probably type in install tailwind
26:10 - css into google and come to the same
26:12 - page
26:13 - yeah click next yes at this point cool
26:17 - and there you go this is what we need to
26:18 - type in so the first thing you type in
26:20 - is gonna be the npm install which is
26:22 - this npm install dash g section you see
26:25 - that quasi
26:27 - got it so
26:28 - uh wait hold on hold on
26:31 - npm and saw dash g
26:33 - yeah right there
26:34 - or dash oh whatever this says right
26:36 - there
26:37 - oh and dash d sorry npm is still there
26:39 - this is the one right that's the one
26:41 - again yes okay okay got it
26:43 - all right cool so we're going to copy
26:44 - this one yeah all right let's go ahead
26:47 - and then this is the one that we're
26:48 - going to install with
26:50 - that's the first one yes cool
26:52 - so here we go let's hit so just copy
26:55 - paste that into your command line in
26:57 - this folder hit enter and that's going
26:59 - to start the installation process for
27:00 - that okay
27:05 - uh i guess for future if you guys want
27:06 - to build your app you should probably
27:08 - just do this this will make it easy to
27:10 - install uh taylormade by default
27:13 - yeah yeah that might be pretty good yeah
27:15 - okay cool and then what's next this one
27:18 - over here
27:19 - exactly then you want to do it exactly
27:21 - you want to do that one next okay cool
27:23 - so let's paste that one that's going to
27:24 - be the next thing that we want to
27:26 - install
27:28 - all right so now it's created a css
27:30 - config file
27:32 - beautiful and you can actually see on
27:33 - the left hand side there's a css config
27:35 - file that's been created for you
27:37 - yep right here that's right and then if
27:39 - you scroll all the way if you scroll
27:41 - more down now in the actual browser so
27:44 - go the browser back to the browser now
27:47 - scroll down you see where it says
27:49 - configure tail want to remove unused
27:51 - styles and production yeah there we go
27:53 - and that purge you see that purge the
27:55 - plus for the purge yeah i'm gonna copy
27:57 - that section
27:59 - and just paste it over that
28:01 - exactly paste it over that purge in the
28:03 - tail without configuring yes so before
28:05 - purge was empty you guys and now we just
28:07 - added these things inside of it
28:11 - yes cool
28:13 - good awesome good beautiful so we've got
28:16 - that okay and then at that point we're
28:19 - pretty pretty much done the one last
28:21 - thing i want you to do is you see how it
28:22 - says
28:24 - scroll down a little bit and it says
28:25 - import till and directly in your gs yep
28:28 - so take this guys and this is the page
28:30 - we want to import it in so go to pages
28:33 - slash so underscore app.js all right
28:36 - all right here
28:38 - and inside here you want to import that
28:39 - exactly yep perfect so i'm going to go
28:41 - here and i'm just going to paste it so
28:43 - that's good
28:44 - beautiful
28:46 - all right and is this it or do i need to
28:48 - do any of this stuff here not yet so
28:51 - that's pretty much that's almost done
28:52 - we've got one last step guys okay let's
28:55 - go back to our initial npm where we
28:57 - fought where we found style components
28:59 - gives you if you hit the back button
29:01 - kazi
29:02 - oh there we go beautiful and then now
29:04 - you want to install the npm i the whole
29:07 - npm i one there we go okay cool so let's
29:10 - go ahead and do that let's copy paste so
29:13 - tailwind has a multiple steps guys to
29:15 - get it to work let's uh to install it so
29:17 - we installed tailwind and now we're
29:19 - going to do tailwind
29:20 - with style components
29:22 - exactly exactly
29:24 - so
29:25 - just to be clear guys so those who don't
29:27 - know raise your hand or raise your hand
29:29 - or just
29:30 - drop in the chat if you don't know what
29:31 - tailwind is
29:32 - like who does not know what tailwind is
29:34 - you probably don't know probably a lot
29:36 - of people don't know so
29:38 - tailwind is like a it's like a css
29:40 - library
29:42 - that basically like combines a few css
29:45 - styles because css is like the core
29:47 - right that's like the core that's like
29:48 - the core that makes everything work yeah
29:50 - um tailwind then is uses those core that
29:54 - core library to go ahead and give you
29:56 - some functionality to make it easier for
29:58 - you to style things it's kind of like
29:59 - bootstrap a little bit yeah i don't
30:01 - think if you heard it before
30:03 - yeah yeah it just makes it easier for
30:05 - you to write your css okay
30:08 - exactly exactly exactly so you installed
30:11 - that that seems to be a little good and
30:13 - now at this point we're pretty much done
30:14 - if you scroll if you keep scrolling to
30:16 - the bottom in that uh on that page it
30:18 - will tell you how do you use this it
30:19 - says import tw uh-huh so copy that yeah
30:24 - and let's use it inside our index.js
30:26 - instead our index.js import that there
30:29 - cool
30:30 - beautiful and guys that's it
30:33 - so now here's the cool part let's go
30:34 - ahead and check out how we go ahead and
30:36 - use now tailwind all right
30:38 - now if you follow me along here instead
30:40 - of using divs now we're gonna use style
30:42 - components so it's kind of like we're
30:44 - creating our own div names
30:47 - yeah watch it
30:48 - right i'm going to say the following i'm
30:49 - going to say a wrapper
30:51 - okay
30:52 - and i'm going to close this out with the
30:53 - wrapper
30:56 - boom of course it's going to break not
30:58 - enough is going to work don't worry
31:00 - now i'm going to create that style
31:01 - component i'm going to say const wrapper
31:05 - is equal to tw dot div
31:07 - we're using the tw that's from here the
31:09 - top
31:10 - right and we're creating the div here
31:12 - and we're using backticks so what these
31:14 - chords called are these are called
31:16 - backticks so they're not quotes be
31:18 - careful with that because a lot of you
31:19 - guys will probably miss
31:21 - miss it right they're back they're like
31:23 - on the left section of your keyboard
31:25 - yeah all right
31:26 - i'm gonna save this now and you can see
31:28 - it's it's kind of working right now
31:29 - right it's kind of there right yeah and
31:32 - it's not even broken that's the cool
31:33 - part
31:34 - also instead of me using this div class
31:36 - name styles map i'm going to say map
31:39 - oop map and i'm going to close that with
31:41 - a map as well
31:43 - boom yeah right instead of doing that
31:46 - start i'm going to say for example i'm
31:48 - going to call this a different name i'm
31:49 - going to say here
31:50 - it's called a action button so i'm going
31:52 - to just call it a little bit differently
31:54 - which is completely okay right they're
31:56 - going to be called action let me see one
31:57 - second it's going to be called action
32:00 - items actually actually items sorry
32:02 - action items
32:04 - action
32:06 - items beautiful and we'll close it up
32:08 - with action items as well
32:13 - of course it's not there yet so we need
32:14 - to go ahead and const
32:16 - action items equals to tw that div so
32:19 - every time you create a
32:21 - div like you know like action items or
32:24 - whatever basically you have to create e
32:27 - specify it using tw.div right yeah now
32:31 - it might be asking question okay i'm
32:32 - going to save this
32:35 - construction map can you go ahead and uh
32:38 - handle runtime error
32:40 - can you refresh it uh yeah sure refresh
32:46 - okay server error requires new
32:53 - [Music]
32:59 - the chrysler constructor map requires
33:02 - new
33:05 - oh that's why we have it we didn't do
33:07 - the map on guys
33:08 - const map
33:10 - as well map is equal to tw
33:13 - that div
33:16 - there we go that's why yep
33:19 - cool
33:20 - beautiful nice let's go
33:22 - beautiful let's go the app is done
33:25 - hey guys thank you so much for watching
33:27 - we'll see you guys in the next one

35:34 - maybe we could try that okay try
35:36 - stopping it and starting it again npm
35:39 - run dev
35:40 - uh let's give it a try so
35:43 - restart
35:47 - hey
35:49 - let's go everybody give it up for david
35:52 - let's go david
35:53 - yeah
35:56 - let's go guys if you have issues like
35:59 - that just go ahead and restart the app
36:02 - quit it out of it and how do you query
36:03 - you said like control c right or control
36:05 - x to quit out of it right uh yeah ctrl c
36:08 - and then just start the run the command
36:10 - again npm run dev
36:12 - that's right and all that is on the
36:13 - terminal guys if you're wondering okay
36:15 - yeah so here's what we did we created
36:17 - the flex we made this wrapper flex we
36:19 - give it a bj red 300 right or let's just
36:21 - uh bg 300 i'm going to you know how we
36:24 - did the whole height screen i'm gonna
36:26 - say h dash screen which represents the
36:29 - height of a 100 vh
36:31 - okay there we go beautiful right and
36:33 - then after that right that's pretty much
36:35 - all we have to do
36:36 - let's look at our map now and with our
36:39 - map we want to give it a flex of one
36:42 - like so
36:43 - which will have them take up as much
36:45 - space as possible and the same is going
36:46 - to happen with the action items right
36:49 - i'm going to give it a flex of dash one
36:55 - now we have map and start so it's
36:57 - exactly the same thing guys as we did
36:59 - the last time capisce
37:02 - capisce beautiful ever understand that
37:04 - so like i said we have flex of one which
37:06 - basically specifies that it's the same
37:08 - weight as the other one guys okay all
37:11 - right so we've got those two things
37:12 - beautiful the next thing guys we're
37:14 - going to work on quasi is what
37:17 - ha you said the next thing

41:09 - need to link your style she says you see
41:11 - how it says link shrek you see that
41:14 - where
41:15 - uh on the on the right include the gljs
41:18 - css file you see that uh-huh copy this
41:20 - no we don't want to copy this we want to
41:22 - do it a little bit differently here
41:24 - because we're using next yes so i gave
41:27 - you the specific code kazi in slack it's
41:30 - called import mapbox gl
41:36 - okay
41:37 - so you want to go ahead and copy that
41:39 - you want to go
41:40 - back to your um app.js guys app.js
41:44 - and then
41:45 - under here
41:47 - then you want to import uh mapbox
41:50 - gl
41:51 - got it okay
41:53 - okay you got it beautiful
41:55 - at that point we're pretty much done
41:57 - pretty much done do we also import this
41:59 - too no no that's gonna be later okay
42:02 - cool yes stop that now hit next on the
42:05 - right section like where you see next in
42:07 - map box
42:08 - okay
42:09 - yes
42:11 - okay now we've got a few things okay you
42:13 - see this bomb mattebox glue because
42:15 - required we don't need that this is
42:17 - where now we import mapbox so let's go
42:19 - back to index.js
42:21 - okay let's go
42:23 - okay and there we're going to import
42:26 - mapbox i'm gonna do this right now okay
42:28 - so give me one second here
42:30 - i'm gonna do this right now for you okay
42:34 - so it's literally just called macbook gl
42:36 - like so
42:41 - like
42:42 - boom so
42:43 - right here okay
42:45 - boom so map gl from mapbox gl okay
42:48 - that's gonna be our macbook gl next i'm
42:51 - gonna do is we're gonna create our uh
42:53 - token so in the specific token and i
42:56 - have a token here but on the right hand
42:58 - side it will show your token
43:00 - as you guys can see in your uh
43:05 - okay it says i don't turn my string
43:07 - constant let's see let's see let's see
43:09 - it's okay you can just do it like this
43:10 - because i forgot to put a beautiful
43:14 - okay okay one second let me go and copy
43:16 - the token properly because i didn't copy
43:17 - it well okay do you want me to use my
43:19 - token or no
43:20 - no i got it okay
43:22 - beautiful all right
43:24 - different token here okay so the token
43:26 - you see on the right side you see how
43:27 - you have you guys have a token on the
43:28 - right hand side um yeah that's the one
43:31 - you want to copy so you want to do matte
43:32 - box gl access token copy that whole
43:35 - thing and paste it exactly where i just
43:37 - showed you yeah right here just like
43:38 - this yes okay done well cost says done
43:42 - wait what cause
43:44 - that's not no no no no no
43:45 - [Laughter]
43:46 - [Music]
43:50 - uh
43:52 - my my brother's name is wakas that's why
43:54 - there you go
43:56 - beautiful so we've got our token guys
43:58 - the reason why we have a token is
43:59 - because this allows madbox to know that
44:01 - hey you know what you are a real person
44:03 - okay
44:05 - yeah now for that after that what we
44:06 - want to do is we want to now create uh
44:09 - our map box now it's a little bit
44:10 - different now
44:11 - as you can see that you see how it says
44:13 - um new map shell that map all that stuff
44:17 - that's not gonna create so inside here
44:19 - yeah
44:21 - we're gonna do like this we're gonna say
44:23 - const map equals new map box stop map
44:26 - like this
44:30 - right here okay don't worry about this
44:32 - so far now this is gonna work
44:36 - we don't want this right now okay
44:38 - okay beautiful now you basically can
44:40 - copy everything that you have on the
44:42 - right hand side near that specific uh
44:44 - what's it called
44:47 - map yeah if you can copy this that's
44:49 - completely fine okay
44:50 - so you can don't worry about it
44:53 - let me see
44:54 - yeah beautiful
44:55 - um
44:56 - next thing we want to do guys is this is
44:58 - a map but it's not really going to work
45:00 - initially because we need to use a
45:02 - different type of style to to make this
45:04 - work now what i mean by that you see we
45:06 - initialize the map this initializes our
45:09 - whole map
45:10 - okay yeah but
45:12 - in our application in next gslash
45:14 - reactor yes
45:16 - in order to initiate something to start
45:18 - the application we use something called
45:19 - use effect
45:21 - that's right so i'm going to import
45:23 - something called use effect import
45:27 - use
45:28 - effect
45:29 - from react you guys can see it right
45:31 - here in the on the on the top
45:33 - okay let's save this right here this is
45:35 - what we got okay
45:36 - and then at that point we're gonna use
45:38 - use effect so use effect
45:42 - boom
45:43 - okay
45:44 - the next thing we're gonna do we're
45:45 - gonna do we're gonna create a function
45:47 - like this
45:49 - and i'm gonna specify that it's a
45:51 - something that's gonna load in the
45:53 - beginning of replication so just to give
45:55 - you guys some context
45:56 - use effect is something that's gonna be
45:59 - uh conglold and whenever your
46:01 - application loads for the first time so
46:03 - if i do console.log
46:04 - yeah
46:06 - log and i say hello
46:10 - all right and i save it okay can you
46:12 - maybe go to the application qazi yeah
46:17 - let's go to the application boom yeah
46:20 - and if you right-click inspect element
46:21 - can you try that yeah there we go okay
46:23 - let's go console
46:25 - beautiful and yeah i see hello right
46:27 - there yeah you can see guys that's hello
46:29 - right and that's only ran the first time
46:32 - that your application gets loaded and
46:33 - that's what we need to do with the map
46:35 - right now i'm going to send you a link
46:36 - here really quickly here okay so i'm
46:38 - going to say map box here essentially
46:39 - link really quickly macbooks using um
46:45 - right here so i'll send you guys this
46:47 - link really quickly
46:49 - you guys can go check this out i'll give
46:50 - you this in slack okay this will give
46:53 - you guys some context on how to use
46:55 - mapbox and react can you go go ahead and
46:57 - open that one up sure
47:00 - all right there we go
47:02 - beautiful i know it's like imitation
47:03 - guys but this is just something you have
47:04 - to learn when you you know get into this
47:06 - okay
47:07 - now let's scroll down scroll down scroll
47:10 - down scroll down scroll down
47:12 - and you will see something called source
47:14 - app.js
47:16 - how do you add mapbox gl to yes right
47:18 - there at the bottom
47:20 - just scroll down okay
47:26 - scrolling
47:28 - there we go keep scrolling yeah and
47:29 - there you have user so skip scroll a
47:31 - little bit more uh-huh
47:33 - there we go and now we get the user fact
47:34 - you everybody see that
47:36 - it actually tells you exactly how to do
47:38 - that right there you see no uh right
47:39 - there use effect
47:41 - okay right there yep got it beautiful
47:43 - yes so that's what we want to do but
47:45 - we're going to do a little bit
47:46 - differently right so we can copy this
47:47 - it's going to copy this quasi uh-huh
47:50 - copied it
47:51 - okay
47:52 - and then go back to our piece of code
47:55 - yeah
47:56 - beautiful and replace it with a used
47:59 - effect with the user effect that we
48:00 - currently have
48:01 - okay beautiful hey beautiful and i'm
48:04 - gonna work with this now okay so we
48:06 - don't need this map.current
48:08 - no don't need none of that
48:10 - okay and so i'm just going to say const
48:13 - map here
48:14 - const map that's going to create our map
48:17 - here
48:18 - this right here container is basically
48:20 - it's going to look for hey where am i
48:22 - going to put my map right what id
48:26 - now
48:27 - to to enter that i if i you look at me i
48:30 - have this map section right here i'm
48:31 - going to give it an id is equal to map
48:34 - yeah
48:35 - right here i can remove this map section
48:37 - right here now this map basically is
48:40 - going to
48:41 - say hey you know what this is where you
48:43 - put
48:44 - your actual map box
48:45 - so instead of doing map continue the
48:47 - current i'm going to say
48:49 - map
48:50 - okay
48:51 - the styles that's completely fine
48:54 - okay for latitude longitude i have a
48:56 - specific lab to launch it's like the
48:57 - center of the united states i can copy
48:59 - and paste this for you guys maybe you
49:00 - guys can copy pixels for you as well
49:02 - it's like -99 right here 39 you guys can
49:06 - copy and paste it for you if you guys on
49:07 - youtube or if you're on on zoom i can
49:09 - even do it for you right now as well so
49:11 - you can all have it all right so let's
49:12 - go ahead and do that right now
49:14 - boom
49:16 - all right then the zoom what do you guys
49:18 - think this zoom does okay what do you
49:20 - think this represents you guys tell them
49:22 - in the chat but you guys think this
49:23 - represents who can tell me
49:24 - what do you think this represents the
49:26 - zoom portion
49:28 - but tell me what is represent
49:30 - that's right it's just a zoom tool but
49:32 - it's basically the zoom number so i'm
49:34 - going to remove this zoom number
49:38 - boom and i'll just give it a three
49:41 - yep you guys are yes
49:48 - there we go
49:50 - that's beautiful
49:52 - i know right so go ahead and close out
49:53 - your uh console console log your inspect
49:56 - element please yeah beautiful by the way
49:59 - i see you guys guessing it correctly in
50:00 - there in the chat you guys were saying
50:02 - you guys know what the zoom is so nice
50:04 - job on that yeah good job everybody so
50:07 - look everything is good all right so
50:09 - this is our first section but of course
50:10 - you guys can see that maybe this map
50:12 - looks a little bit different than we
50:14 - usually look uh what we first showed you
50:16 - it's because there's a different style
50:18 - you see this right here this this style
50:20 - we want to have by the way this is the
50:22 - style that we want
50:23 - so i have a different style right here
50:25 - i'm going to copy this for you
50:27 - and paste it in for you right here
50:30 - well
50:31 - it's a different style i'll paste it in
50:33 - for you and zoom guys if you want to
50:34 - check it out yeah this is the style here
50:36 - we'll paste it in zoom and a monother
50:38 - somebody if you guys can paste it on
50:40 - youtube as well so if somebody needs it
50:42 - they can have it
50:44 - exactly
50:45 - so now you guys can see that the map
50:47 - looks very different yeah yeah that's
50:49 - that yeah it looks very very very
50:51 - different so the map guys is done it is
50:54 - done we can remove all this section we
50:56 - don't need any of this right here
50:58 - right
50:59 - we can save this and our map is pretty
51:01 - good now i'm going to do this now a
51:02 - little bit differently guys now one of
51:03 - the coolest things about
51:05 - nextgs that you can do is the fact that
51:08 - you guys can create something called
51:09 - components and who can who can tell me
51:10 - what are components what do you guys
51:12 - think who can tell me
51:14 - what are components if you guys are in
51:16 - zoom what are components
51:19 - what are components huh
51:24 - components
51:27 - what can tell me
51:28 - it's a piece of code that's right
51:30 - reusable ui element a part on your app
51:32 - parts of a whole yeah that's a good way
51:34 - to think about it
51:36 - beautiful it's a reusable ui element
51:38 - right so it's like almost like you use
51:40 - the same
51:41 - kind of little structure block to be
51:43 - able to use in multiple places so for
51:45 - the map because we're gonna be using
51:47 - multiple places guys i'm going to create
51:49 - a component for this right away
51:51 - so if we go back to pages if you go to
51:53 - the pages section you click right new
51:55 - for a click and you click new file
51:58 - uh and and okay our new folder in your
52:01 - folder and create that called the
52:03 - components okay we're going to put that
52:05 - inside of pages right metal pages you
52:07 - guys can see already created right here
52:08 - well okay okay you created it while i
52:10 - was creating it so i'm going to delete
52:12 - mine cool there we go okay
52:14 - so then i'm going to create inside here
52:16 - i'm going to create a new file right
52:18 - click a new file and i'll say map dot js
52:21 - guys
52:21 - boom
52:23 - that's our map now okay that's gonna be
52:26 - our component there's nothing in here so
52:28 - to really quickly create a component i'm
52:30 - gonna say r a f c e and this is a really
52:33 - cool um kind of you know a handy dandy
52:36 - tool what is the tool called uh cozy do
52:38 - you know uh it's like extensions so it's
52:41 - uh if you go into
52:44 - uh if you wanna install this extension
52:47 - it's like is co is uh react.js code s7
52:50 - it's like yeah snippets and stuff like
52:52 - that so it's this one right here es7
52:54 - react redux snippets and then you can do
52:57 - rafce and then essentially just makes a
53:00 - component for you right off the bat
53:03 - exactly beautiful
53:04 - so within this at this point we're gonna
53:06 - i'm going to go back to my index.js and
53:08 - i will import a lot of stuff that i need
53:10 - of course i'm going to import my
53:12 - tailwind and my my map box as well we'll
53:15 - copy all of that i will go back to
53:17 - mata.js i will use it i will also import
53:22 - import use effect that's we're going to
53:24 - use inside
53:26 - here you could just do it over here i
53:29 - think
53:30 - huh
53:31 - you could do it up here but that's fine
53:33 - yeah i can just i don't need the react
53:35 - portion at all honestly
53:37 - right so got that and then i'm pretty
53:39 - much going to do the same thing i did
53:40 - before because remember i'm going to
53:43 - create this div called wrapper
53:46 - right
53:49 - wrapper i'm going to give an id is equal
53:51 - to math
53:55 - they're like looks like uh david rokosi
53:57 - had a hand in that styling
53:59 - yes
54:00 - yes he did what's up david
54:02 - let's go dude he had a lot of hand in
54:05 - building this app actually behind the
54:06 - scenes oh yeah oh yeah he did it
54:10 - everybody yeah let's go
54:17 - all right
54:18 - okay the developer in the shadows
54:22 - true that through that i will go ahead
54:25 - and import this map.gl access token so
54:27 - go ahead and copy all of that
54:29 - or or actually cut it go back to my gs
54:32 - we're going to use it now here
54:34 - okay
54:36 - okay
54:37 - right again we're just making it a
54:39 - little bit more diverse another is a
54:40 - little bit more kind of componentized i
54:42 - like to call it right after that i will
54:44 - copy this user effect because i don't
54:46 - need this insight here i will command
54:48 - exit i will cut it
54:50 - put it into the map section
54:52 - boom boom boom
54:54 - use effect beautiful save it
54:58 - okay
54:59 - okay and then let's go back to my app.js
55:02 - oh it is sorry
55:04 - and i don't really need this at this
55:05 - point right this whole map thing i don't
55:07 - even need this either you know even this
55:09 - at this point now
55:12 - instead of doing map i actually import
55:14 - the whole component i will say import
55:17 - map
55:19 - see and then right away told me that
55:21 - it's inside the components.map right so
55:22 - we create this component we're going to
55:24 - import it now instead of doing this i'll
55:26 - just simply say like this
55:30 - save
55:31 - so let's see will it work will it work
55:33 - let me see let me see it says fail to
55:35 - compile it's okay
55:37 - and if our map has already been declared
55:39 - it's okay because if we scroll here guys
55:41 - you guys can see we have this const map
55:43 - we don't need this remove this
55:47 - save it boom okay wrapper is not defined
55:50 - don't worry because inside the map.js we
55:52 - have this wrapper inside here so we need
55:54 - to create it using const
55:56 - wrapper is equal to what do you guys
55:58 - think what do i do here guys who knows
56:00 - put on the zoom chat put on the youtubes
56:03 - guys what i do here to create the div
56:05 - that's right ralph i do what
56:08 - dot
56:10 - exactly
56:11 - okay i will save it
56:14 - and it's not there for a certain reason
56:17 - because guys
56:19 - remember guys we had this flex one when
56:21 - we defined our map so i'm going to call
56:23 - this flex dash one now
56:25 - and watch our map coming back back again
56:27 - oh
56:28 - it's back it's back okay give me one
56:30 - second
56:32 - [Music]
56:36 - okay uh turn off

56:50 - the best way to turn off italics um

56:57 - and i'll see if i can figure that out
57:00 - so guys we've got one thing
57:03 - working okay the map is done
57:06 - part one of this is done of course now
57:09 - the next i'm gonna work on is the bottom

62:40 - okay so that's fully white okay great
62:42 - we've got the uber logo the next thing
62:44 - i'm going to do is i'm going to define
62:46 - super look i'm going to give it a height
62:47 - okay
62:49 - for the height i will say h 28
62:52 - right that's going to give it a height
62:53 - so h stands for height so it's going to
62:54 - make it a little bit smaller and
62:56 - honestly that's that's pretty much it
62:58 - then what i'm going to do is on the
63:00 - profile i will create a few things right
63:02 - i'm going to create a profile container
63:05 - okay profile container and then inside
63:07 - that let's go ahead and do that i'll say
63:08 - profile
63:10 - boom
63:12 - oops
63:13 - and inside that there's two things guys
63:15 - we have the name
63:18 - the name
63:19 - uh for now it's gonna be rafae kazi for
63:21 - example
63:25 - okay and then we've got wakazi at that

63:38 - might see a difference right guys you
63:39 - see how we have start this up like this
63:41 - and then we end we have an end tag this
63:43 - is a start tag this is an end text those
63:45 - are you who are wondering okay yeah and
63:47 - then
63:48 - but inside here inside an image we don't
63:51 - actually have an end tag but the reason
63:53 - why is pay attention it's called a
63:54 - self-closing tag
63:57 - self-closing
63:59 - tag
64:00 - oh why
64:03 - is because here you see this slash at
64:05 - the bottom on the right yeah that's the
64:08 - self-closing portion okay because of
64:10 - this okay so that's why i wanna just
64:13 - want to showcase to you guys
64:15 - okay for the user image it's also gonna
64:17 - be it's a different source
64:19 - so
64:19 - um i have a different source i have a
64:22 - specific user image
64:24 - let's see if i can grab a user image
64:26 - that i like let me see here
64:28 - i got that right there copy image
64:30 - address right here you can grab any
64:32 - image guys i'm gonna i'm gonna give
64:34 - myself my own image
64:36 - sorry guys you're gonna be me

64:40 - okay
64:41 - now i'm going to create those specific
64:43 - divs guys for the profile guys who can
64:45 - tell me what do we create guys kant's
64:46 - profile what
64:48 - before write it out what is it tw dot
64:50 - what dot
64:52 - div
64:56 - okay
64:58 - then we've got of course we've got the
65:00 - name so it's going to create the name
65:01 - one
65:02 - const
65:04 - name is equal to tw dot div as well okay
65:08 - and then finally the last thing is going
65:10 - to be
65:11 - user image now for the user image what
65:13 - is it tw dot what who can guess
65:15 - fireplace can get
65:18 - the user image const
65:20 - user image is equal to what tw dot
65:24 - image yes sam that's right
65:27 - oh not you image
65:32 - all right let's go and save that let's
65:33 - look at our application here in a second
65:35 - here beautiful so we got two things guys
65:37 - we got the uber we've got the rafikaze
65:40 - and we got the image guys okay
65:42 - now
65:43 - we know that we need to have all of our
65:45 - profile stuff on the right hand side
65:47 - right you guys know that at this point
65:49 - now how do we make that work
65:51 - who can actually tell me
65:53 - if you guys can guess
65:55 - to make it work from left to right we
65:57 - use something called
65:59 - something called what not float
66:02 - relax
66:04 - that is right
66:06 - yeah that's right
66:07 - so
66:08 - i will say that on the profile section i
66:11 - will say here this i will say
66:13 - flex
66:15 - watch this
66:17 - a so don't worry that's just
66:19 - that puts the name
66:21 - left inside of this but
66:23 - to make the whole thing flex i go to the
66:25 - header
66:27 - and i say flex
66:29 - yeah
66:31 - right oh do you guys see it by the way
66:33 - yeah do you guys see as i type in flex
66:34 - yeah good you guys do okay we have flex
66:37 - on the header as well okay cool so you
66:39 - guys can see that rafikaze is right
66:41 - there
66:42 - the next thing i want to do is
66:44 - for our header
66:47 - okay i will say flex
66:49 - space and now i'm going to say um
66:53 - it's called justify between now yeah
66:56 - what this does
66:58 - what does it do kazi
67:00 - it will justify between give spaces
67:03 - exactly it it will give as much space as
67:05 - possible between all the things right
67:08 - all the things inside here yeah then
67:10 - after that for the header i'm gonna make
67:11 - align everything uh in a kind of like uh
67:15 - you know to the center so i will say
67:16 - here
67:18 - item center
67:22 - and it's kind of like centered i mean
67:23 - but not yet but you will see it centered
67:25 - in a little bit okay
67:27 - after that
67:28 - i will go ahead and close this out i
67:30 - will go back to my user image and i'm
67:31 - going to modify this image because it's
67:33 - a little bit too big for now okay
67:35 - yeah for the user image i'm going to say
67:38 - that's going to be a height of 12 and a
67:41 - width of twelves okay so that's a h of
67:42 - twelve
67:46 - beautiful
67:47 - it's gonna become a lot smaller great
67:48 - now how do we add those round corners
67:50 - kazi
67:51 - who can tell
67:53 - border radius baby let's go border
67:56 - radius
67:57 - you gotta add that in every time you
67:59 - need those rounded corners
68:01 - that's right and tail and c says it's
68:03 - called rounded full okay let me open
68:06 - that round
68:07 - thank you
68:09 - look how beautiful that is right yeah
68:11 - run it full okay so we're kind of there
68:13 - now
68:14 - next thing i want to do is center the
68:15 - rafikaze portion
68:17 - yeah so i'm going to say in the profile
68:20 - i will say flex
68:22 - items
68:23 - dash center
68:26 - you guys can see me typing right there
68:27 - yep
68:29 - beautiful and i'm going to give a margin
68:31 - right uh
68:33 - 4 on the name
68:34 - so for this name right here i'm going to
68:35 - say mr-4
68:39 - okay
68:40 - and a specific name i'm going to give it
68:42 - a width of 20.
68:46 - okay so far looking pretty good i like
68:48 - the way this is going by the way this is
68:50 - looking good now for the user image back
68:52 - to here guys and now our user image kind
68:54 - of has like a small kind of border that
68:56 - you might not see so far but has a small
68:58 - border okay to give it a border what we
69:00 - need to do is say border here
69:04 - right and i'll say border gray
69:08 - dash i'm going to say it's going to be
69:10 - 200.
69:12 - you might not see it yet why because
69:14 - it's covered by the image
69:16 - okay so to make sure it's everywhere
69:20 - we give it a padding right i'm going to
69:22 - say p dash px
69:25 - save it
69:26 - nice
69:28 - you guys see that blue border kind of
69:29 - like if i do you can see a little border
69:31 - has everywhere if i do p dash two for
69:33 - example
69:34 - three
69:36 - yeah yeah you see that right there
69:38 - that's the border right but if i do
69:39 - ps2px it's only gonna give it a small
69:41 - border nice right there beautiful so
69:45 - so far it's looking not too bad
69:47 - i'm like where this is going the only
69:49 - one they want to modify is for the name
69:52 - i'm going to give it a text of small
69:55 - just to get a small text okay it's just
69:57 - a little smaller text and that's pretty
69:59 - much it guys so we've got our uber we
70:01 - got our thing all is good there
70:04 - how do you think let me ask you this
70:05 - question how do we you see how on the
70:07 - right hand side how our profile is so
70:09 - close to the right edge
70:11 - yeah how do you think we can give a
70:13 - spacing for the right edge you guys can
70:15 - tell me
70:18 - what do we do they're saying padding
70:19 - some are saying margin
70:22 - that's right that's right now if i want
70:24 - to give space on the inside of a box
70:26 - which one we use this one you should
70:28 - definitely get
70:31 - if when i have that
70:33 - what do i do then
70:35 - who can tell me
70:40 - that's right it's gonna be padding
70:42 - guys now i'm going to give padding on
70:44 - the whole actual item this whole thing
70:47 - i'm going to give padding on because
70:48 - this whole thing kind of you know
70:50 - reflects the whole application so for
70:52 - the action items
70:54 - right actual items i will say here p
70:57 - dash four
70:59 - and that will make this a lot smaller
71:01 - like this can you maybe zoom out a
71:03 - little bit kaze because i feel like you
71:04 - zoomed in for your application so it's
71:05 - like it loose looks very okay
71:08 - yeah thank you
71:10 - there we go do you want me to take them
71:11 - out more like this much
71:13 - this is good yeah i like that okay cool
71:16 - i like that all right guys
71:18 - the top header thing is now done
71:21 - okay capiche done now
71:24 - the next thing we're going to work on is
71:27 - what
71:28 - what is the next thing we need to create
71:29 - guys who can tell me
71:32 - what's the next thing do you create
71:34 - it's going to be what
71:38 - section is a cousin huh yeah that's

86:58 - that's the next thing that we're
86:59 - actually going to be working on
87:01 - yeah
87:02 - so in nextgs to create our a different
87:05 - page you literally just create a new
87:08 - file inside your pages yeah they make it
87:11 - really simple with uh next because in
87:13 - react you have to do routing and a bunch
87:15 - of stuff
87:16 - in next all you're going to see him do
87:18 - is he's going to create a new page here
87:20 - underneath i'm going to call it search
87:22 - yes yeah and that's automatically going
87:24 - to like as soon as you click ride it'll
87:26 - automatically take you to that page so
87:27 - here's search okay and to be able to go
87:30 - to the search page that he made so
87:33 - uh yeah just add in something
87:36 - right so i'm gonna call the search i'm
87:38 - not making capital the reason why i'm
87:39 - making the class names capital because
87:41 - that's a good uh convention to go by
87:43 - cool and even if he says like something
87:45 - like hello here
87:46 - i can actually do at the end of this
87:48 - local host i can go slash search
87:52 - right and uh it actually brings me to
87:54 - that page right here so uh that's a
87:57 - really nice part about next
88:00 - yeah i like that a lot too i like that a
88:02 - lot too
88:03 - so if we know oh dang what happened here

88:22 - okay well in next year we have something
88:25 - called the link so i will go ahead and
88:26 - show this to you guys if we go up
88:29 - we have import link from next link
88:32 - that's right so in usual html you have
88:34 - like each a you know a shrek you know
88:36 - stuff like that but because we're using
88:38 - a different technology we're using links
88:40 - and where do you guys think we're going
88:42 - to put links around who can tell me
88:44 - where you're putting links around who
88:45 - can tell me what is it
88:46 - what is the thing we're putting the
88:48 - links around
88:49 - what is it
88:51 - no no not the ride well yeah i think
88:53 - i'll keep the ride but what is the
88:54 - button yeah that's right the button yes
88:56 - it is technically the right but yes
88:58 - so inside here i will say link
89:01 - shref is equal to
89:03 - dash search
89:05 - that's right that's all you have to do
89:07 - guys okay
89:09 - and then
89:10 - at end that link
89:12 - yep and this link is coming from
89:15 - uh
89:16 - hold on one second just before you start
89:18 - typing this link is yeah so again i know
89:21 - knowledge just showed you this but just
89:22 - remember this okay you're getting
89:24 - importing this link
89:27 - cool exactly so we're importing this
89:29 - link and this link says hey to which
89:31 - page are we going to we're going to the
89:33 - search page so if i go and save this
89:36 - save that so if you click on the kazi on
89:39 - the right section boom takes me to the
89:41 - home page
89:43 - right up there beautiful okay
89:46 - now in the search page a few things need
89:48 - to happen to make this work so let's
89:50 - just i think just get started on that
89:52 - one right away okay yeah
89:54 - let's go inside yes oh too source ideas

90:06 - copy from there
90:08 - paste it
90:10 - say
90:11 - done

90:15 - call the wrapper
90:18 - that's the usual thing beautiful
90:24 - there we go
90:27 - okay i'm gonna put um
90:30 - kind of practice around this because
90:31 - usually we have parentheses but because
90:34 - of is linting it kind of makes it
90:36 - cleaner so that's okay i kind of like it
90:38 - like this though
90:39 - rapper there we go beautiful

103:21 - pretty big of course don't worry we'll
103:24 - make it smaller i got you guys okay
103:27 - now the first resource i want to work on
103:30 - is the from two icons okay uh they're
103:32 - kind of like you know you can just give
103:34 - it a specific width that's the most
103:36 - important thing so
103:38 - for the front two icons let's go down
103:40 - here
103:42 - and change the way it works so i'll give
103:44 - it a width
103:46 - 10
103:47 - that should make it right away smaller
103:49 - okay
103:51 - now i'm going to give it a specific uh
103:53 - kind of like um flex
103:56 - yeah
103:57 - flex

104:07 - okay next i'm gonna do is i will go and
104:09 - do how do we center these guys who knows
104:12 - because if you guys can say i mean
104:14 - they're pretty much centered now at this
104:15 - point but
104:16 - you know not the way you wanted to
104:18 - however i do want to change
104:22 - the input container right the ipo
104:24 - container right now is the whole thing

104:33 - beautiful
104:35 - so that looks pretty good i kind of like
104:37 - where that's coming from okay now next
104:40 - thing i'm gonna do is i will go ahead
104:42 - and add the actual input uh buttons
104:45 - themselves don't worry we'll go back to
104:47 - the actual circles and squares to make
104:49 - that a little bit smaller i got you
104:51 - right inside the input container guys
104:54 - we'll create input boxes
104:57 - for people to actually use
104:59 - okay
105:01 - beautiful got the input boxes i like it
105:05 - okay
105:07 - nice

105:18 - for the you know for the whole uh when
105:20 - you when you guys type it in
105:22 - so input
105:24 - good
105:25 - and for the input guys
105:28 - i mean nothing so far but there's two
105:29 - inputs here we got one
105:32 - another one
105:34 - but
105:35 - so far it's kind of nothing okay i'll go
105:37 - to input boxes let's go ahead and create
105:39 - a simple boxes
105:41 - const input boxes
105:45 - beautiful
105:47 - is equal to tw dot dip
105:51 - shouldn't still work don't worry
105:54 - but i will go ahead and const input
105:59 - i think to that without what guys who
106:00 - can you can get me okay who can guess
106:02 - what is it
106:03 - cw dot
106:06 - what is it yeah damn that one you guys
106:08 - got it
106:09 - so gw dot input
106:14 - let's see
106:16 - okay they don't show up it's okay okay
106:19 - because you need to give them a specific
106:21 - height guys don't worry okay so now
106:23 - we don't really see them all we need to
106:25 - do is now modify the input to make sure
106:27 - it actually kind of works and it's kind
106:28 - of there right so let's go ahead and
106:30 - give it a number one in height
106:32 - so i'm going to h-10
106:35 - beautiful okay i will go ahead and give
106:38 - it a bgray
106:44 - dash 200
106:46 - huge shout out by the way to everybody
106:48 - that's still here like y'all are champs

106:53 - is confusing anthony's yeah anthony's
106:55 - going off but like seriously give
106:58 - yourselves a huge like pat on the back
107:01 - this seriously is awesome like
107:03 - because yes because it's tricky to be
107:05 - able to pay attention for this long but
107:07 - guys like this is what coding and
107:09 - development is
107:10 - yes yes it is it is so guys you guys can
107:13 - see we got the two buttons right here we
107:14 - got can you maybe you see how those two
107:16 - buttons you don't really see them but i
107:17 - will add a placeholder so if we go ahead
107:19 - and do a placeholder here
107:21 - holder is and you will see it none then
107:23 - placeholder and i want to say for
107:24 - placeholder uh your location so let's go
107:27 - ahead and set enter pickup location
107:29 - [Music]
107:31 - enter pickup location
107:35 - okay you guys can see it right there
107:36 - right right array and the next is going
107:38 - to be place folder
107:41 - is equal to
107:42 - uh where to
107:47 - boom
107:49 - okay so two buttons now now of course
107:52 - what you can see is they're kind of like
107:53 - on top of each other right so the input
107:56 - boxes one is underneath the from two
107:58 - icons right so this whole info box is
107:59 - underneath the from two icons how do we
108:01 - make sure they go from left to right who
108:03 - can tell me guys quick question huh what
108:06 - can we do
108:07 - what can we do
108:11 - what do you guys think
108:13 - yeah that's right we need to go and flex
108:15 - it okay
108:18 - so let's go ahead and go to the bottom
108:20 - go to input container and we say flex
108:25 - okay
108:26 - nice beautiful
108:29 - now it's from left to right
108:30 - okay and then at that point what i'm
108:33 - going to do is
108:34 - for the entrepreneurship and the where
108:36 - to
108:38 - input boxes how to make it go from top
108:40 - to bottom
108:42 - what do you do now
108:44 - do you guys think that's right we flex
108:46 - columns we say flex here
108:48 - and we say flex dash column
108:53 - there we go right there we go that's
108:55 - exactly what we want to do
108:57 - for the input flexes
108:59 - for the input boxes we wanted to take up
109:01 - as much space as possible so i'm going
109:02 - to give it a flex of one
109:06 - save it
109:07 - there you go so now it's taking up as
109:08 - much space as possible also the same
109:11 - time i'm going to give it a margin y so
109:12 - for every every single input right you
109:15 - see how they're stuck together let's go
109:17 - ahead and separate them so i'm going to
109:18 - say um my-two
109:20 - that gives what is it what do you guys
109:22 - think this y stands for
109:24 - what does y stand for you can tell me
109:28 - that's right overage it is the y-axis so
109:31 - basically padding on the y-axis top and
109:33 - bottom like vertical padding
109:36 - that's right vertical padding right
109:38 - m x is like the x-axis that's the
109:41 - horizontal padding okay
109:43 - that's our input beautiful the input as
109:46 - well i'm going to give it a round it
109:47 - because remember it's kind of like edgy
109:49 - right now which i don't like so i'm
109:50 - going to say here a rounded
109:54 - two
109:56 - get a specific grounding so it's kind of
109:58 - starting is it there it's kind of there
110:00 - maybe not there rounded dash two and
110:03 - then what i'll do at that point is let's
110:06 - see
110:08 - is is p dash to
110:12 - give the padding
110:13 - okay beautiful so that you can see that
110:15 - the pickup location kind of separates
110:17 - from everything and the one thing i want

112:28 - we'll fix it okay we got you so the
112:30 - first thing i'm going to do is for the
112:31 - image let's give the width and the
112:33 - height so width 10
112:35 - and h-10
112:38 - okay okay so now it's a little better
112:40 - hopefully okay
112:42 - i'm going to go ahead and give it a
112:43 - round of applause now to make it into
112:45 - like a full circle the first thing i'm
112:46 - going to do is i'm going to do a bg
112:47 - great so bg dash gray
112:50 - dash 200
112:52 - that's going you see right there that's
112:54 - the thing right so that's all good
112:56 - okay but how do i go ahead and make it
112:59 - so that it's a full-on rounded circle
113:02 - what do i do here kazi
113:04 - give it
113:06 - yeah
113:07 - border radius 50 50 but with tail it
113:11 - says
113:12 - we're using the called rounded full
113:16 - boom see right there just like that it
113:19 - is the way we want it okay
113:21 - um now you see how it's very close to
113:23 - the pickup location all the input stuff
113:25 - i will say margin left
113:28 - dash
113:29 - let's just say it's like margin left
113:31 - three maybe
113:35 - or is it margin margin is it not doing
113:37 - that no no that's that's that's the
113:38 - input sorry not on this one i don't want
113:40 - the plus icon ml string
113:45 - there we go beautiful and the one other
113:47 - thing i want to do is i want to make
113:48 - sure everything is centered vertically
113:50 - so
113:52 - who can tell me how do i center
113:54 - everything vertically make sure that
113:55 - everything even the plus icon is all
113:57 - centered vertically
113:59 - what do i do who can tell me
114:02 - it's literally like two lines of code
114:03 - guys
114:04 - what i do
114:06 - not a reverse
114:09 - not reverse item center that's right but
114:11 - on which component
114:13 - on this one
114:14 - on this one or on this one
114:17 - which component
114:18 - or maybe even a different component
114:22 - it's actually going to be on the input
114:24 - container guys so on the input container
114:26 - i will do flex that's so good but i will
114:29 - do items
114:31 - dash center
114:35 - boom you see the plus icon right away
114:38 - is right there on the bottom okay next
114:40 - i'm going to do is i will going to
114:42 - create some spacing for everything so
114:45 - for the input container guys let's go
114:47 - ahead and go back to input container
114:50 - scroll down boom boom boom let's create
114:52 - some spacing guys okay so i'm gonna say
114:55 - one
114:56 - p x dash four
114:58 - you're gonna space it from left to right
115:00 - okay so it's a little bit cleaner now
115:02 - and also for the actual uh with the from
115:05 - two icon right i'm also creating some
115:07 - spacing as well because i just kind of
115:08 - don't like the way it is so i will have
115:11 - here with the from two icon that's for
115:13 - the bottom whereas there is a wizard
115:15 - with the wizard wizard from two icons
115:17 - okay i will say margin the right is what
115:21 - maybe like two
115:23 - okay i'm liking this okay i'm liking
115:25 - this already beautiful i'm also going to
115:27 - say for the input container i will say
115:29 - margin bottom because i want to have
115:31 - space in the bottom section say margin
115:32 - bottom dish too as well
115:34 - like christmas place on the bottom too
115:37 - did it
115:38 - let's see come on did it
115:40 - no
115:44 - maybe the bottom maybe it's on the
115:46 - actual let me see here yeah input
115:48 - container
115:49 - all right here mb-2
115:52 - no
115:54 - okay nevermind okay
115:55 - so oh but yes it did it created margin
115:58 - but because remember guys margin is the
116:00 - spacing on the outside guys remember
116:02 - right margin is spacing on the outside
116:05 - okay
116:06 - okay now let's look at these
116:09 - circles they're a bit too big i don't
116:11 - like it
116:12 - so every circle gonna define give the
116:14 - height
116:15 - for the circle i'm gonna say this is a
116:16 - height of h2 2.5
116:20 - so h
116:22 - right here
116:23 - h of
116:24 - 2.5
116:27 - oops 2.5
116:28 - save
116:29 - okay don't worry about it we'll figure
116:31 - it out okay and then finally
116:34 - for the line
116:37 - a h of 10
116:40 - okay
116:43 - h-10
116:45 - don't worry
116:46 - okay and then for the square as well
116:48 - it's gonna be h of three guys okay
116:52 - the square is gonna be h of three
116:55 - each test three
116:58 - save it okay don't worry we got you okay
117:01 - so now you see how it's all stretched
117:02 - out you see on the right hand side it's
117:04 - all stretched out doesn't look good at
117:06 - all so
117:07 - make it work okay there's a really cool
117:10 - trick that i like to use because what is
117:12 - trying to do is you're trying to take up
117:13 - as much space you know in terms of like
117:16 - um horizontally
117:18 - and that's all because of flex guys okay
117:20 - flex that makes it do that so if i go to
117:23 - the input container here
117:25 - all right i'm sorry the actual from two
117:27 - icons
117:29 - okay you guys see where i'm typing right
117:31 - yeah the from two icons okay
117:34 - i will say here
117:35 - items
117:37 - the center
117:40 - boom you see that magically just fix it
117:43 - all
117:45 - magic is fixed up because item center is
117:47 - put in the center and so it prevents the
117:50 - divs from trying to stretch as much as
117:52 - possible that's the cool part about it
117:55 - okay so we got the word too we've got
117:57 - all this stuff looking pretty good i'm
117:58 - lucky this is going beautiful
118:01 - okay
118:02 - good good good
118:03 - okay
118:04 - the last thing we're going to do is i'm
118:06 - going to create the safe places so we've
118:08 - got the input container guys that's all
118:10 - good the last thing is going to be well
118:13 - the saved places
118:16 - that's pretty easy one honestly uh all
118:18 - we'll do is create a div here
118:21 - they have here called saved places so
118:23 - i'm gonna say here
118:24 - saved places here
118:27 - outside the input container so i'm say
118:28 - here saved
118:31 - places
118:32 - beautiful okay and inside here there's a
118:35 - few things we've got we've got the icon
118:38 - so let's click the star icon
118:41 - start icon and has a source is equal to
118:44 - something
118:46 - okay and there you go i'll give you guys
118:48 - the image right now in a second here so
118:49 - i'm going to copy and paste the image
118:51 - for you
118:52 - so i've got the image right here
118:56 - boom
118:57 - i'll place it for you guys in the zoom
119:01 - boom
119:03 - okay beautiful
119:05 - and then at that i'm gonna say i'm gonna
119:07 - say saved places
119:10 - for text
119:12 - beautiful then it's underneath here guys
119:14 - we're gonna create the actual style
119:16 - component of it okay let's go and do
119:17 - this const

119:57 - icon okay i want to make this icon right
119:59 - here uh to have a square so i'm going to
120:01 - give for the star

120:24 - width and a height because it's a bit
120:25 - too big guys so width that's 10 and then
120:27 - height dash 10.
120:30 - okay a little bit smaller now all good
120:32 - next i'm going to give it is a padding
120:34 - of 2 p 2 is going to be it's going to
120:37 - create some space and inside that's
120:39 - there we go exactly what i want and then
120:41 - finally i'm going to make it round how
120:43 - to make it rounded who knows at this
120:45 - point we've done it multiple times

128:23 - to cleverpromo.com
128:25 - discord and you'll see it there okay
128:27 - absolutely
128:28 - make you know the most important that
128:30 - you guys can do in coding is make
128:31 - networks and make connections that's
128:33 - probably like that's that's honestly
128:35 - like how you grow as a developer
128:37 - people and so forth
128:39 - yeah guys i so i know like some of you
128:41 - felt overwhelmed actually why don't you
128:43 - just say it uh raise your hands if you
128:45 - felt either overwhelmed today or just
128:47 - drop it in the chat i'd love to see it
128:49 - okay
128:51 - i know that this is i know a lot of a
128:53 - lot of me so what i want to say is what
128:55 - we've been saying from the start right
128:56 - these these coding days are going to
128:58 - feel a little overwhelming and just keep
129:00 - in mind this is pretty advanced stuff
129:01 - that we're doing okay
129:03 - so we're gonna be trying to simplify it
129:06 - for you guys um but when we're showing
129:09 - you this big build and if we're building
129:10 - uber it's gonna be a little bit complex
129:12 - but our goal with this challenge is to
129:14 - show you how coding works so let me ask
129:16 - you this at least was it enjoyable for
129:18 - you to watch has this been an enjoyable
129:20 - experience yes beautiful thank you guys
129:24 - okay very much so please thank you guys

129:28 - but more i was watching the more i was
129:29 - definitely understanding peter says
129:31 - absolutely
129:32 - i liked it but a little bit fast okay it
129:35 - seems doable but i'm a newbie
129:37 - okay thank you the coding part was good
129:39 - but i followed the process to all the
129:40 - packages yep okay so
129:43 - that's the idea right it's this is going
129:46 - to be a lot that we're going to be doing
129:48 - for you know from complete step by step
129:51 - and all of that stuff if you guys want
