08:34 - airbnbs like i got tried while you're

08:38 - didn't talk anything about
08:40 - a javascript product at that time no no
08:41 - no no it wasn't at that time
08:43 - so like he was there we hung out we did
08:46 - a lot of cool [ __ ] we like went to some
08:48 - coffee shops went on long walks talked
08:50 - just
08:51 - i remember you would jump into whatever
08:53 - we were doing he would work
08:54 - really hard but at this point you were
08:56 - also opposed to a javascript product
08:58 - oh because you guys are just python you
09:01 - didn't really not even do it you were
09:02 - opposed to it
09:03 - oh yeah i didn't want to do a javascript
09:05 - product yeah yeah yeah i'm like we gotta
09:07 - stick to python like as a python it has
09:09 - to be on brand what are you doing
09:11 - like what are you talking about i
09:12 - remember you were like let's talk let's
09:14 - do something with javascript or
09:15 - something you know but i remember
09:16 - another thing like i
09:18 - hit it off with people really well even
09:20 - when i think of my best and closest
09:22 - friends
09:22 - it's not just from like having
09:24 - conversations with them where i become
09:25 - really good friends with something is we
09:27 - do something in common
09:28 - yes so for example some of my best
09:30 - friends i remember playing ping pong
09:31 - i play one game with them up to 400
09:34 - points
09:34 - i think it would be like insane that's
09:37 - crazy uh
09:38 - or some other my best friends like we
09:39 - became friends over chess
09:41 - some friends became friends over work
09:44 - like
09:44 - hard ass work that's what i felt about
09:46 - frankie and aaron and that's how
09:48 - i felt like i bonded with you a lot we
09:51 - would work
09:52 - really hard like we would get to we work
09:53 - and just i mean we
09:55 - worked you know what i'm saying we
09:56 - actually really cool is we remember we
09:57 - went to a conference it was like tai

10:31 - start to think about okay maybe i want
10:32 - to
10:33 - i want to talk to him potentially like
10:34 - about potential like a javascript but i
10:36 - never said anything though right yeah
10:37 - sorry like something my mind was i had
10:39 - them that thought of my mind but never

14:11 - with modules and video titles
14:14 - on the on the spot on the call yeah yeah
14:16 - i remember that that was really awesome
14:18 - i opened up the document it was like
14:19 - okay bro let's think about this what are
14:20 - we gonna do module one we should do some
14:22 - intro right module two maybe do like
14:23 - going to advanced javascript right
14:25 - i mean we're thinking about crazy
14:26 - projects what to do that was epic
14:29 - that was really really cool because even
14:31 - from the start
14:32 - what we thought about is we we
14:35 - constantly kept thinking about what is a
14:36 - transformation that we could put
14:38 - somebody through and we
14:39 - purely focus on like there shouldn't be
14:41 - a single module that doesn't have
14:43 - projects because i
14:44 - am so sick and tired i was so sick and
14:46 - tired of
14:47 - going through so much crap and just
14:48 - doing theory during theory because i
14:51 - would
14:51 - get left and i'm like why did i learn
14:53 - like the theory behind sequel
14:55 - like but but it was almost like i got i
14:58 - always felt like i got baited and
15:00 - switched
15:00 - it was like you're gonna make this
15:02 - you're gonna do this and then i would
15:03 - leave and i would just have theory
15:05 - and i'd be like so what am i supposed to
15:08 - do with like raw sequel in python
15:10 - why did they teach me raw sequel in
15:13 - python
15:13 - like there isn't a [ __ ] orm like i
15:16 - can just
15:17 - i could have just started writing you
15:18 - know what i mean like been
15:20 - having a conversation with the database
15:21 - like just teach me
15:23 - so well i am yeah so it's like let's say
15:25 - you want to become a racer and all they
15:27 - keep teaching you is like
15:28 - how do you make a car how do you
15:30 - manufacture the parts like the math
15:32 - behind the physics and you're like
15:33 - i just want to race bro i just want to
15:35 - race here's what a car is made up of all
15:37 - these parts and you just keep learning
15:38 - that non-stop you know that doesn't get
15:40 - that like it doesn't get you anywhere so
15:42 - so like i was so frustrated i wanted to
15:45 - make sure that every single thing
15:47 - had a project i remember i was talking
15:48 - to you and i was like let's
15:50 - think about projects first yes and i
15:52 - remember
15:53 - we also talked about like bro we need to
15:55 - do this differently than like udemy or
15:56 - something like that you know because
15:58 - like
15:58 - udemy yes is great but we're like okay
16:01 - but we want to
16:02 - we want to take this into where we
16:03 - create a community where we really make
16:05 - a transformation
16:06 - and i remember how but how did he come
16:09 - about with the profit with javascript
16:10 - like the actual like name
16:12 - like how did that come about i remember
16:14 - that i was sitting there and i could
16:16 - the the kick-ass javascript i liked it
16:19 - but it didn't really sit well with me
16:20 - yeah
16:21 - we kept brainstorming we kept
16:23 - brainstorming and i kept thinking i
16:24 - don't know necessarily whose
16:26 - idea it was um i mean i like to think it
16:29 - was mine but
16:30 - you know i don't know probably it's
16:31 - gonna be like you know it's so long i
16:32 - don't remember
16:33 - but like i remember that somehow we came
16:35 - up with the idea of like between kick
16:37 - ass javascript and profit with
16:39 - javascript because
16:40 - i wanted to focus on what was the result
16:42 - that it got and what made it stand out
16:44 - from everything else
16:45 - another reason with kick ass was i was
16:46 - like is facebook gonna learn you know
16:48 - let us run ads on kick ass because ass
16:50 - is a bad word so they might not allow it
16:53 - but i wanted to make sure that it
16:55 - focused on actual transformation that
16:58 - people got so i wanted to go okay you're
17:01 - not just gonna learn some cute stuff
17:03 - you're gonna like
17:04 - es6 like actual cool features like
17:07 - actual things that
17:08 - landed people jobs or so they could make
17:11 - an income
17:13 - and that's how we came up with the name
17:14 - like we were in between profit with
17:16 - javascript and kick-ass javascript for a
17:17 - while
17:18 - yeah and eventually we ended up like
17:20 - finally just going with profit with
17:21 - javascript and then i think at that
17:22 - point
17:23 - when we decided kind of the modules we
17:25 - decided what we decided on the name
17:27 - then we all got together we built the
17:29 - sales page now and this was the really
17:30 - cool part and i was like oh
17:32 - [ __ ] yeah it is so awesome to be part of
17:34 - such an epic team i remember
17:35 - together aaron it was frankie
17:39 - you right we were all together we were
17:41 - working on the sales page
17:42 - of this of this product and like i
17:45 - remember like it was like you know for
17:47 - hours and hours per day we were working
17:49 - on this and
17:50 - and and then we actually got into like
17:52 - okay let's launch this
17:53 - yeah we wanted to showcase what the
17:55 - product was what it did
17:57 - for people and like we made the sales
17:59 - page
18:00 - which like and we hadn't made the
18:01 - product yet we'd let everybody know the
18:03 - product is going to be coming soon right
18:05 - but we wanted to see if people would
18:06 - have
18:07 - any amount of interest because if people
18:09 - had no interest in it
18:10 - then we didn't want to like launch it
18:12 - and get behind it we believe that it's
18:14 - something that could help transform
18:15 - people's lives but if the people don't
18:17 - believe it then it doesn't matter like
18:19 - we didn't want to fall just in love with
18:20 - our product we wanted to fall in love
18:22 - with our customers right so if our
18:23 - customers are not in love with something
18:26 - that's not a place where we should be
18:28 - spending our
18:29 - energy you know yeah so we launched this
18:32 - thing
18:32 - on how did we launch it black friday or
18:34 - something like friday it was like last
18:35 - year like friday
18:36 - friday last year yeah it was literally
18:37 - last year where
18:39 - we just passed the anniversary
18:43 - let's go we just wanted to see uh
18:46 - how people would respond to it and the
18:49 - response was
18:50 - [ __ ] amazing it was overwhelming
18:53 - it was like i woke up i'm like oh my god
18:56 - oh my god i slept that night at wework
19:01 - are you serious they frown upon that but
19:03 - i slept
19:05 - at wework on a couch oh yeah extremely
19:07 - uncomfortable

20:14 - we'll work together
20:16 - and then we're like okay bro let's let's
20:17 - build together let's build modules
20:18 - together okay i'm like oh let's do it
20:19 - let's do this so he came over he came
20:21 - over
20:22 - uh now this time to my house i met mama

20:34 - that bad bro
20:36 - it's a pretty cool cool room it's got
20:38 - everything it's gone
20:39 - it's a super dope room and we like we
20:41 - made tick tocks and oh yeah yeah i
20:44 - started learning dancing
20:45 - the first two days the first day that
20:47 - you were around
20:48 - we were making tick tocks the whole time
20:50 - and actually epic tic tacs
20:52 - and we made tic tacs for students as
20:53 - well like to actually have fun like
20:55 - bro we're working on the modules that
20:56 - was ton of fun and and yeah we just kind
20:58 - of started and then we went to europe i
21:00 - remember this one day we went to we
21:01 - worked
21:01 - like okay we actually i need to show the
21:03 - module yeah we had a lot of fun let's
21:05 - actually shoot the module
21:06 - yeah and we went to wework we actually
21:08 - got started you're like
21:09 - yeah we set up um we shot so guess the
21:12 - number
21:13 - and like again a bunch of the content at
21:15 - your house
21:16 - module two i think module three as well
21:18 - yeah we would stay up till really late
21:19 - shooting the content at your house
21:21 - yeah and then we like set it up like the
21:23 - blue light in the back and it was kind
21:25 - of nice
21:25 - and then after that we went to uh
21:28 - another important thing was a lot of the
21:30 - content and ideas we were coming as
21:32 - coming up with them as we were doing
21:34 - them it wasn't like we had it all
21:35 - planned out
21:36 - the more the more videos we made the
21:38 - more ideas we got of like what to make
21:40 - next
21:40 - yeah and then yeah and then the next day
21:42 - we woke up i remember it was like day
21:43 - three or four or something and then it
21:45 - was freezing cold
21:46 - winter and then we went to wework to
21:48 - actually work and it's so interesting i
21:50 - actually remember
21:51 - i was sick like crazy i was sick at that
21:54 - time yeah i was taking the time like
21:55 - unless i'm just looking at my camera and
21:57 - i'm like i look like i'm dying man
22:00 - i look at the camera holy moly but yeah
22:02 - we went to ebook
22:03 - and i think that day we just went
22:05 - straight into it like little we locked
22:06 - ourselves in one room
22:08 - you know locked ourselves in one room
22:09 - and we just started working start
22:10 - recording
22:11 - we you got the yeti mic i think i had it
22:12 - getting mic as well
22:14 - and and i think we were we worked
22:16 - literally from like
22:17 - 2 p.m i think oh 12 p.m yeah and then
22:20 - when we finish
22:21 - midnight probably probably no bro later
22:24 - we went to like until the next day
22:26 - morning
22:27 - oh remember we were like dying oh yeah
22:30 - yeah yeah it was like really awful like
22:32 - sleep to prep like crazy like it might
22:33 - have been the next morning and then we
22:34 - met some dude who like
22:36 - was making a app for instagram yeah yeah
22:38 - right like we
22:39 - like literally i think it was like till
22:40 - the next day we were like zombies
22:42 - you know after after you stay up past a
22:45 - certain time you go into the zombie mode
22:47 - we're just like dragging on with like
22:50 - zero energy but like your body is still
22:52 - like moving and you can like
22:54 - still do some stuff yeah we were at that
22:56 - level yeah it was crazy it was crazy and
22:58 - then we kind of finished that up
22:59 - and then finally kind of went home and
23:00 - they're like oh [ __ ] and then i think
23:02 - and i think
23:02 - that's probably just kind of crashed at
23:03 - that point crazy ups and downs we had
23:06 - while actually making this
23:08 - content for the course but the most
23:10 - important north star
23:12 - for us the entire time for this product
23:15 - was
23:16 - transformation transformation focus on
23:18 - the transformation don't focus on you're
23:20 - gonna learn this thing and this thing
23:21 - and this thing and this theory and this
23:23 - theory and this theory and just like
23:24 - get up in it yeah it was constantly like
23:27 - focus on
23:28 - taking somebody who takes it from point
23:30 - a to point b
23:31 - so they can get a job or they can get
23:33 - freelancing work
23:34 - or they can have an actual career so
23:37 - that
23:38 - was uh important very helpful north star
23:40 - because we could have just
23:41 - got stuck making content that was just
23:44 - like more information that's actually
23:45 - what made us more
23:46 - like made it more exciting as well to
23:48 - build it because if you just
23:50 - build it just say for example if you
23:51 - build like a udemy course you just build
23:52 - just like okay
23:53 - i'm going to build this project versus
23:55 - i'm going to like
23:56 - versus we're going to build this to
23:58 - actually you know to help people
24:00 - to get them jobs to get them freelancing
24:03 - jobs whatever it might be
24:04 - that just makes it so much more exciting
24:07 - yeah and i was like
24:08 - yes and that is the course well you need
24:11 - to take
24:11 - but that is the course that we would
24:13 - love to build yes or i would love to
24:14 - build as well yeah
24:15 - right so that was the course that like
24:17 - you know when i thought about it and we
24:19 - were like okay
24:19 - every single module is gonna have an
24:22 - actual real world project and we were
24:24 - kind of relentless about that you know
24:25 - we were like make something and we're
24:26 - like no
24:27 - like none of this stuff you know um like
24:30 - we don't want to put the most basic
24:32 - stuff in there like to-do list and then
24:34 - the whole thing is over you know that's
24:35 - that's it and then everything else is
24:37 - theory
24:37 - so we're pretty relentless with it we
24:39 - wanted to put the google maps project
24:41 - we're like hey let's actually build
24:42 - full-on applications like whether it's
24:44 - an instagram clone or whatever it is
24:46 - like let's make sure that we are
24:48 - building real world things the entire
24:50 - time yeah yeah
24:51 - yeah and i think of course that that was
24:53 - our goal and i think at that point
24:54 - once we started with that then then kind
24:57 - of the whole team got together then we
24:58 - did
24:59 - another launch and then we got into
25:01 - coaching much how we got into coaching
25:03 - but we got to remember
25:04 - do you remember how do we get to
25:05 - coaching um
25:08 - i actually i don't exactly know what
25:10 - made us want to do like
25:12 - two to three weekly coaching calls every
25:14 - single week i don't remember
25:15 - what caused that but what i do remember
25:18 - specifically that was like crazy was
25:20 - i was sitting there and we came up like
25:22 - i came up i was in my underwear and i
25:24 - was like on slack and working and i'm
25:26 - like you know what
25:26 - one of the best ideas you ever came up
25:28 - with was moving our team to slack
25:31 - and then also that made us move the
25:33 - customers to slack
25:34 - we were in between discord and slack
25:36 - slack was just a way better option by
25:38 - every single mean because just a much
25:40 - better productive work environment
25:41 - especially for coding
25:43 - discord was better for gaming also
25:47 - we we realized i was like sitting there
25:49 - thinking and i'm like
25:50 - how can we make the community
25:52 - self-sustaining so they can actually
25:53 - help each other
25:54 - and that was the day we came up with the
25:56 - idea of profit of javascript success
25:58 - coaches
25:58 - yeah oh yeah that was really interesting
26:00 - yeah yeah so like that was something
26:02 - where it was like holy crap this has not
26:05 - been seen
26:06 - anywhere before you know like no program
26:09 - has other
26:10 - coaches in there that are actually
26:12 - giving you video feedback on your code
26:14 - like students who enrolled into the
26:16 - course now become coaches themselves and
26:18 - are coaching other people like
26:20 - how cool is that and that that's awesome
26:22 - because now you're coming from
26:24 - a point of like people are coming from a
26:26 - very
26:27 - simple point of view right if you're
26:29 - someone who
26:30 - just learned for example javascript
26:32 - right you can now teach someone who is a
26:34 - complete beginner
26:35 - with a very simple matter because you're
26:37 - still that beginner partially beginner
26:38 - as well
26:39 - yeah it's kind of like how i explain it
26:41 - like when you were in a math class
26:43 - and the professor wasn't making sense to
26:45 - what he was saying
26:46 - yeah but when you asked your buddy he
26:47 - was like this dumb dude who's sitting
26:49 - right next to me he's like yeah this is
26:51 - you know scary over the one
26:52 - you're like oh my god this algebra
26:55 - equation
26:56 - makes complete sense yeah yeah so your
26:58 - peers can sometimes actually do a better
27:00 - job
27:00 - and we wanted to make sure it was
27:02 - students that were qualified to be a
27:03 - success coach they were like the top
27:05 - performing students
27:06 - in the program and we created a
27:08 - structure
27:09 - around where they can actually take your
27:12 - code or
27:12 - anybody's code make a video feedback on
27:16 - it and send it back to you so that
27:17 - started creating like a very
27:19 - revolutionary
27:20 - type of experience in the program and
27:22 - that's the day the community started
27:24 - going to a whole another
27:26 - level uh and it started to become like a
27:29 - experience where it was like family for
27:31 - them yeah yeah it was like family i
27:32 - remember getting on calls with like with
27:34 - like the success coaches
27:35 - and talking about like what can we do
27:36 - for the students yeah and talking about
27:38 - what type of coaching goals we can all
27:40 - do
27:40 - like it was awesome like it was it's
27:42 - literally like you're building almost
27:43 - like
27:44 - a university but like a different type
27:46 - of like 21st century university within
27:48 - within this community
27:49 - yeah so the one thing that we actually
27:52 - didn't hit on
27:53 - is i think probably the biggest
27:54 - breakthrough we ever had was the
27:56 - momentum
27:57 - of like actually creating a community
28:00 - before
28:01 - students even got into profit with
28:02 - javascript that made it actually have an
28:04 - amazing community
28:05 - yeah so it was the first time we did a
28:07 - regular launch and we had a bunch of
28:08 - students enroll
28:10 - so around april we decided to do this
28:12 - like five day
28:13 - free facebook challenge javascript
28:15 - challenge javascript challenge
28:17 - we told students we're going to build
28:18 - google maps and we're going to make like
28:20 - fun projects in there
28:21 - yeah and uh we had tons of people sign
28:24 - up we ran this campaign on facebook
28:27 - and we had like 10 or 20 000 people
28:29 - registered for the challenge 50 000
28:30 - people yeah
28:31 - 15 000. it was crazy it was the biggest
28:34 - javascript challenge that has ever run
28:36 - in the world
28:37 - unless i'm missing something it was
28:39 - crazy because i remember this is
28:40 - something new that we haven't seen
28:41 - ever before and we get we got 50 000
28:44 - people and we literally the whole team
28:46 - were just working non-stop
28:48 - to just deliver value and just like have
28:50 - fun with it like i remember
28:51 - i remember literally me and aaron were

30:04 - eight hundred people live sometimes over
30:06 - a thousand people live
30:07 - watching and it was crazy and these
30:10 - people would be taking like
30:11 - instagram stories and tagging us from
30:13 - their homes and their computers
30:15 - and like sharing it and we would see the
30:18 - instagram stories and we're like oh my

31:30 - humbling and fun experiences
31:33 - of our entire lives i think it made us
31:35 - even more excited to actually
31:36 - to continue but it made us even more
31:38 - excited to put even more time and effort

32:01 - one like it's going to be absolutely
32:02 - insanely
32:03 - twice as much of like effort than even
32:06 - probably the first one i will say

32:26 - crazy workshops crazy workshops with a
32:29 - lot of amazing people

32:33 - spoil it i don't wanna spell it right
32:34 - now
32:34 - like but it's gonna be fun uh so this is
32:37 - gonna be super super exciting but we
32:39 - remember
32:40 - going back to march this year
32:43 - the challenges were the things that
32:45 - really let us like communicate
32:47 - what's inside of this product yeah like
32:49 - it it let us like explain what the
32:51 - family and community is like
32:53 - by providing it for free on facebook
32:55 - yeah now we can't sustain that forever
32:57 - because
32:58 - we need to be able to have a real
33:01 - company and we need to get everybody
33:03 - paid so
33:03 - we can have amazing people like nas or
33:05 - frankie or
33:07 - people who are running the community so
33:08 - like we gave them
33:10 - a free incredible experience the best
33:13 - that we could
33:14 - just from the facebook challenge and
33:16 - then when the students joined the course
33:18 - then we continued it there you know so
33:20 - that gave us the best way to
33:22 - explain what this like what this amazing
33:26 - product is and i remember it's it was so
33:28 - cool
33:29 - when we started doing coaching calls on
33:31 - the thing on the first or second
33:32 - coaching call
33:33 - i was like you know what how about we do
33:36 - some dancing together you know
33:38 - to to this day like all my all my life i
33:40 - was like
33:41 - how can i merge like these two passions
33:43 - of like dancing
33:44 - and coding you know there's always my
33:46 - mind like how can i do that how could
33:48 - that happen
33:49 - yeah and here it was like we were on the
33:50 - coaching call i think was like 25 people
33:52 - at that point like holy [ __ ] 25 people
33:54 - and i was like hey guys how about we do
33:57 - some dancing
33:59 - yeah and then we literally started doing
34:00 - some dancing and people were
34:02 - pumped man like i was like let's go
34:05 - people were waving around their hands
34:07 - we used to get 25 people live on the
34:09 - coaching calls and profit with
34:10 - javascript and that was like
34:12 - crazy to have 25 people live and it was
34:14 - amazing on the zoom to see
34:16 - 25 human beings because even though i do
34:19 - youtube and we do youtube
34:20 - you don't see anybody else so it's still
34:22 - like you're talking to a camera and then
34:23 - everything else is a number right so 25
34:25 - is a lot
34:26 - how many do we get like now now we get
34:28 - from 100 to 150
34:30 - depending that's a lot of people in a
34:32 - room a lot of people don't know
34:33 - everything
34:34 - that's a lot of people dancing man
34:35 - there's a lot of people dancing
34:37 - and and it's so so cool now that portion
34:39 - of like for example dancing for example
34:41 - now providing value through a coaching
34:43 - call which is just a lot of fun indeed
34:45 - just in general but then actually
34:47 - dancing it out and having fun in the end
34:49 - yeah that also became such a big part of
34:52 - the product
34:53 - that like i still to this day like uh
34:55 - tell me like
34:56 - let's do dancing every single coaching
34:58 - call literally
34:59 - and so whenever i'm like guys are you
35:01 - ready are you ready are you ready
35:03 - they're like
35:04 - let's go like people have like their
35:06 - lights in the background people bring
35:07 - guitars bro
35:09 - it's insane man and now it's become such
35:11 - a big part of it not like
35:13 - now like between the js challenge
35:14 - between you know the success coaches
35:16 - between
35:17 - like the slack community how it all just
35:19 - came about
35:20 - is like so in a way in a way a little
35:22 - bit like random
35:23 - yes but almost like brutal amounts of
35:26 - work and effort like
35:28 - but then at the end now it's like now
35:31 - that is the reason why it is now
35:33 - it's like uma thurman and kill bill when
35:36 - she's
35:37 - dead when it starts and she's dead in a
35:39 - casket she's just just punching her way
35:41 - through
35:42 - yeah and then she like breaks the casket
35:44 - her hands come out of the grave and
35:46 - she's like
35:48 - it was kind of like that how this came
35:49 - together we're like holy [ __ ] there's so
35:51 - much work we're being buried under the
35:53 - work we can't possibly do anymore
35:55 - we're gonna die under stress in the
35:57 - lounge like come on come on
35:58 - come on ah oh and then finally we just
36:01 - like broke through the casket
36:03 - our hand came up through the mud and
36:06 - like we finally saw the light and we
36:08 - came
36:08 - out and made it alive and and in the
36:11 - wake of it
36:12 - had created something brilliant that was
36:14 - bigger than us
36:15 - bigger than us bigger than me and it
36:18 - became a family
36:19 - and now it's really really cool to see
36:21 - like how much they care for each other
36:23 - like there's no question that's ever
36:26 - unanswered in slack
36:27 - they will there's gonna be somebody
36:29 - who's gonna freaking respond
36:32 - they break off into their own groups we
36:34 - don't even know about this
36:36 - literally i don't even know like parents
36:37 - like what are you guys doing when i talk
36:38 - to students they're like yeah yeah we
36:39 - got this we're trying to stop them from
36:41 - collaborating
36:42 - stop it's unhealthy go to sleep get some
