00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hey guys how's it going this is Kazi
00:09 - from clever programmer calm welcome back
00:14 - today we're going to do a challenge on
00:16 - Oxford comma challenge so we have done
00:20 - from lowercase up to the journal icing
00:23 - challenge up to here and if you haven't
00:25 - done that no problem just go back to my
00:27 - videos and do those challenges if you're
00:29 - on my website I'll put the links to all
00:31 - the previous challenges we've done so
00:34 - you could take a look at them and if
00:36 - you're on my website again you could
00:37 - code right there on the platform the
00:40 - link is in the description below if
00:41 - you're watching this on YouTube let's
00:43 - continue so we have this challenge and
00:46 - it says and we're going to do this live
00:49 - some again and I want to stress that I'm
00:52 - thinking out loud here with you guys I
00:54 - was about to cheat and look at it before
00:55 - the video so I could prepare myself and
00:57 - then come off really smart but instead
01:00 - what I'm going to do is just do it live
01:02 - so if I'm making mistakes it's okay you
01:04 - see me make the mistakes okay and then
01:05 - we just walk through it and step through
01:06 - it and build things all right I'll make
01:10 - a function comma Phi that given a list
01:12 - of three or more things return a list
01:15 - with commas okay so it could be three
01:17 - things or more things but keep that in
01:19 - mind the list that's given to us is
01:22 - definitely going to be three or more
01:23 - things which means that we don't have to
01:25 - account for two things or one thing or
01:27 - zero things okay that makes your coding
01:29 - life a little bit easier that's why I
01:31 - pay attention instructions sometimes you
01:33 - might do something that you don't even
01:35 - have to do and you might spend a lot of
01:38 - time doing that so if we get if we gave
01:42 - comma Phi the function a list like this
01:45 - trinket learning fun it should return it
01:47 - as trinket comma learning comma space
01:49 - and space fun okay
01:53 - that is very interesting so one thing
01:56 - I'm thinking about already is I could
02:02 - probably call the join function and join
02:05 - it with commas in a space but the
02:08 - problem that happens there is the last
02:12 - one
02:13 - won't have a space so for example here's
02:15 - what I mean if I open up a command line
02:16 - I'll show you what I'm what I'm talking
02:18 - about
02:19 - [Music]
02:21 - hello and Apple ok so if I do dot join
02:29 - method on this and run it with a comment
02:33 - of space you see I join it all haha
02:37 - hello Apple haha comma space hello comma
02:41 - space Apple but there's no end here so
02:44 - I'm thinking about how we would go into
02:48 - that now wondering if we directly tap
02:52 - into the list that's given to us get the
02:54 - last element prepend and the word end
02:58 - and a space and then just called a dot
03:03 - join method so here's what I mean if we
03:06 - tap into this exact list right and
03:09 - instead of this just saying Apple we
03:11 - make it and Apple and then we call the
03:14 - dot join method with the comma and a
03:16 - space does that work yeah that that
03:21 - works right haha hello and Apple okay so
03:24 - how would we change the last guy let's
03:28 - figure that out so if I'm given a list
03:31 - to access the last element I do negative
03:34 - one and I will say make this element
03:42 - what this element was
03:48 - and floss space what this element was
03:54 - previously ah so that's an interesting
03:57 - line what the heck does that do so let's
04:00 - do this oh and we shouldn't call things
04:03 - list like that because list is a
04:05 - built-in but whatever shame on you hour
04:08 - of Python all right so what we're going
04:15 - to do is we're going to call this list
04:18 - just list okay
04:23 - and then what I'll do is I'll use this
04:28 - line and then we'll see what happens
04:31 - okay
04:32 - and now we'll call list and looks like
04:37 - it worked okay looks like this line did
04:41 - exactly what we wanted it to do now
04:44 - let's go back here and what we'll do is
04:49 - just call the dot join method on this
04:51 - remember just like we said so now if I
04:53 - call dot join right and I join it by a
05:01 - comma in a space and I called about
05:05 - joint on that list looks like it is
05:11 - doing exactly what we expected it to do
05:13 - now let's do that
05:16 - return
05:24 - like this comment a space okay let's try
05:31 - it out so trinket learning fun should
05:33 - turn into trinket so it should turn into
05:36 - one string that says so it should go
05:38 - from a list of three elements trinket
05:41 - learning fun to a string one string that
05:44 - says trinket comma space learning comma
05:47 - space and space fun let's run it
05:53 - trinket comma space learning comma space
05:56 - and fun
05:56 - boom and to prove to you there's a space
05:58 - there I even highlighted it lions
06:01 - comma space tigers own space and bears
06:04 - beautiful okay so hopefully you saw how
06:07 - we got it to work that's okay if you can
06:09 - figure out on your own but now that you
06:12 - understand it do exactly what I said in
06:13 - the previous video go back to the
06:15 - drawing board and try to come up with a
06:17 - solution yourself a lot of coding
06:20 - challenges I see don't do this right
06:22 - it's one guy behind the screen who's
06:24 - already solved the problem and then they
06:26 - just try to like spit out the solution
06:28 - back at you which is cool I mean you can
06:31 - learn from it but I think it's important
06:33 - to see how you go about coming up with
06:35 - the solution so you know that's what I
06:37 - would do I would open up my command line
06:39 - try out these things see what it means
06:41 - and then go back to my Python scripts
06:43 - and add these things in as I build a
06:46 - project and make it bigger and remember
06:48 - if you want to build those apps like I
06:49 - show you in my old P course or in even
06:52 - my Python learn Python course that's
06:54 - free these are the skills that you need
06:58 - to be able to do those bigger projects
07:00 - so even if you're trying to take my app
07:01 - course you're trying to take any other
07:03 - online course or you're just trying to
07:05 - build apps on your own with Python or
07:07 - whatever you need these fundamental
07:10 - skills so then you can build whatever
07:13 - you want okay because if you don't have
07:15 - these you won't be able to build big
07:18 - apps and you won't be able to even build
07:20 - small apps right you've become really
07:22 - limited with your ability of what you
07:24 - can do if you want to change the world
07:25 - with code you better be able to do some
07:28 - of the stuff from scratch and be able to
07:31 - think about it that's it for this video
07:33 - I hope you liked it
07:35 - on YouTube give it a little like button
07:36 - and subscribe to the channel as always
07:39 - thank you guys so much for watching I
07:42 - love your faces off and I'll see you in
