00:05 - i really didn't want to
00:06 - have to do this
00:09 - and i really did not want to sit here
00:12 - and make this video
00:15 - didn't want to make a [ __ ] video at
00:16 - all
00:20 - but there are just certain things i have
00:23 - to tell you
00:24 - to your face otherwise you're not gonna
00:28 - hear me
00:34 - it's just so frustrating seeing this
00:38 - again and again happening to
00:41 - so many of you
00:45 - and it's heartbreaking but it's also
00:47 - frustrating
00:52 - i see this all the time even when i'm
00:54 - interviewing people right
00:56 - they come in and we interviewed them and
00:59 - they got
00:59 - great projects great portfolios we
01:02 - interviewed them
01:04 - we'll ask them for a simple problem hey
01:07 - write a recursive fibonacci sequence hey
01:10 - do this one thing right hey here's an
01:13 - api just fetch data and plop it up on
01:15 - the screen
01:20 - what i don't i can't work in pressure
01:23 - this is too much pressure oh
01:27 - what the [ __ ] are you talking about this
01:30 - is your job
01:30 - you do this right you practice coding
01:36 - so what what's the pressure about i
01:38 - don't understand
01:41 - it's like if you were to hire somebody
01:43 - who's who you if you were a
01:44 - basketball team manager and you wanted
01:46 - somebody i'm watching the last dance
01:48 - which is
01:49 - an epic um documentary
01:52 - with uh um what's gonna say jordan
01:56 - peterson
01:58 - with michael jordan and
02:02 - if you are manager like jerry krause
02:05 - right it was kind of who was like a
02:06 - shitty manager but whatever like
02:08 - you still have to bring somebody in and
02:09 - see if they can shoot a basketball or
02:11 - not right because if they can't shoot
02:14 - what are they going to do on your team
02:15 - it's useless
02:17 - so as somebody who's a recruiter and
02:19 - you're about to hire somebody
02:23 - you have to see their coding skills
02:24 - right so if you can't code
02:27 - you always have to be coding right you
02:29 - always have to be in front of somebody
02:31 - even at a company you're coding
02:33 - somewhere and you're writing code that's
02:34 - going to face
02:35 - customers so there's always going to be
02:36 - pressure it's going to never be not
02:38 - pressure
02:41 - so you should be good at it you should
02:43 - be able to fetch an api you should be
02:44 - able to
02:45 - problem solve get used to that [ __ ]
02:48 - pressure
02:49 - like i don't understand why so many
02:52 - developers
02:53 - speak like it's a whole me too movement
02:54 - going on like
02:57 - nobody's asking you to do something
02:58 - weird we're literally saying hey do your
03:00 - job here's the keyboard do what you're
03:02 - best at and we're going to give you the
03:03 - room but like go
03:05 - freak out [ __ ] break down but you
03:08 - know why
03:09 - it really is it's not because most
03:11 - developers have this problem
03:13 - or their bubble it's because they don't
03:14 - have the [ __ ] skill
03:16 - you don't have to [ __ ] skill
03:21 - so when you don't have it you know what
03:23 - you do
03:24 - you go i'm going to blame it on
03:27 - something else and that something else
03:28 - is
03:29 - ah you're putting too much pressure on
03:30 - your you're watching me
03:32 - you you know i'm coding you're thinking
03:34 - about me coding
03:35 - uh even if you're out of the room i can
03:37 - just hear your thoughts and that's why i
03:39 - can't [ __ ] code this
03:40 - no it's because you suck or because
03:43 - you got trained from somewhere and that
03:45 - place [ __ ] sucked
03:47 - and they didn't teach you the skills
03:49 - that you needed to learn and now you're
03:50 - in this space
03:52 - you're in the spot where you got the job
03:54 - interview
03:55 - but you're never gonna get the [ __ ]
03:56 - job
03:59 - or you're definitely not going to get
04:00 - the job of your dreams
04:02 - right if you want to make 80 000 100 000
04:04 - or more you're never going to get that
04:06 - job if you don't have the actual skills
04:08 - for you you'll get something less than
04:09 - that most developers are 50 60 they're
04:11 - like yeah i got a job as a developer
04:13 - that's great that's fantastic but is it
04:16 - really the job of your dreams is this
04:18 - something that you truly deeply love
04:20 - and if it is fantastic can't okay you
04:22 - found your happiness but for the rest of
04:24 - you
04:24 - who want to do more and who want to get
04:27 - better and if you don't have a job and
04:28 - you want to get a high paying job
04:30 - you have to get your skills down and you
04:32 - have to be able to withstand the
04:33 - pressure that comes with it
04:35 - but withstanding the pressure right
04:36 - confidence comes from
04:38 - competence so if you're competence
04:43 - is [ __ ] well your confidence
04:47 - it's not going to be that much far from
04:49 - that
04:51 - so you have to get better at your
04:54 - competence
04:55 - that's the best way because otherwise
04:56 - i'd be telling you to do some [ __ ]
04:58 - some fake [ __ ] and that's not gonna help
05:00 - you so you have to go
05:02 - and work okay when i say work i mean
05:06 - work now watch my [ __ ] video now
05:09 - watch
05:09 - other content creators youtube videos
05:11 - that's not work
05:12 - now follow along on some tutorial
05:15 - although that could help you right those
05:17 - were helpful that's why we
05:19 - make so many clones and build projects
05:21 - so you can watch them but
05:23 - even that's not gonna help you you need
05:26 - to sit down by yourself
05:28 - in a very boring room and
05:31 - have code and code things from scratch
05:34 - and write code
05:35 - from [ __ ] scratch and do that today
05:39 - because you're looking for the next
05:41 - dopamine hit what can i click on youtube
05:44 - that's going to catch my attention oh
05:45 - it's this video
05:46 - watch then after there's going to be
05:48 - another [ __ ] video then after this is
05:50 - going to be some other [ __ ]
05:52 - but you're not gonna get closer to your
05:54 - goal
05:56 - what i want you to do is get off this
05:58 - [ __ ] video
05:59 - and get off this platform and go and
06:02 - code
06:04 - and problem solve and then come back and
06:07 - share with me what you problem solved
06:09 - and like
06:10 - share your code or share a link to your
06:12 - you know you could code on replica
06:13 - whatever i don't care
06:14 - but i will care when you post it i want
06:17 - to take a look at it and see what you
06:18 - did
06:19 - that would be fantastic but i need you
06:21 - to improve your ability okay
06:23 - because if you don't nobody's going to
06:25 - come to save you
06:26 - no project is going to come to save you
06:28 - next.js and graphql and redux
06:31 - no hot new technology is going to save
06:32 - you if your fundamentals are weak if
06:34 - your fundamentals are weak
06:35 - it's like a foundation of a building is
06:37 - weak okay
06:38 - you can't build a skyscraper or a flimsy
06:40 - foundation
06:42 - right now
06:47 - i stole that from him
06:52 - so it's really that simple
06:55 - go work on your coding skills please
06:58 - okay

07:18 - to not be able to have these skills down
07:21 - costing you and it's costing your family
07:27 - so please spend time go code
07:30 - every day problem solving websites are
