00:00 - that's it hey guys what's up this is
00:13 - Kazi from clever programmer calm and in
00:18 - this livestream again we're live on
00:20 - Instagram we're live on YouTube and
00:22 - we'll be live on Facebook in just a
00:24 - little bit we are going to be talking
00:28 - about why some of the best programmers
00:30 - are broke and how you can avoid that I'm
00:34 - also gonna show you how much you're
00:36 - gonna be earning as a Python developer
00:38 - so we're gonna actually do some math in
00:40 - this video so you can start to see what
00:42 - it looks like for you so we're gonna
00:44 - talk about how much a Python freelancer
00:47 - at a lower rate could charge at a lower
00:49 - hourly rate and I'm gonna show you what
00:53 - that income for you can look like weekly
00:55 - what that income could look like for you
00:57 - monthly and what that income could look
00:59 - like to you
01:00 - yearly okay and we're also gonna talk
01:04 - about the profitable program or master
01:07 - class which is now live and available to
01:10 - you for free and all of that is
01:12 - available to you in the links in the

03:06 - okay so mid-november is when you should
03:09 - be looking out for the new course called
03:11 - create apps and land your first client
03:14 - with Python in less than 90 days and get
03:17 - that first paycheck
03:19 - cool so look out for that in
03:23 - mid-november watching on Instagram and
03:25 - YouTube as well great you're getting two

03:45 - I'll answer your guys's questions as
03:47 - they come along as well as go over some
03:50 - of the main points of this livestream so
03:53 - in this livestream we are going to be
03:55 - covering why the best programmers are
03:57 - broke and how you can avoid that we are
04:00 - going to be talking about your Python
04:02 - earning potential and what you could be
04:05 - looking to make as a Python freelancer
04:07 - okay so we're gonna be talking about
04:08 - that and I'm also gonna show you where
04:12 - you can I've put together a calculator
04:14 - for you where you can go and calculate
04:16 - your Python freelance for earning
04:18 - potential and you could literally click
04:20 - this link and use my calculator and
04:23 - steal it okay so I've also got that for
04:25 - you so those are some of the main things
04:28 - we're gonna be doing other than that
04:30 - we're gonna be going into the third
04:31 - thing is we're gonna hit the Q&A and get
04:34 - some questions and I'm gonna answer them
04:36 - for you guys cool
04:46 - yes the decoder says I'm an Opie student
04:50 - will the course be free for me so
04:53 - everybody who got my previous course
04:55 - called oo P create apps with Python the
05:02 - new course for you will be completely
05:04 - free ok so that's my gift to all of my
05:09 - existing students who've gotten my
05:11 - previous Opie course so yeah yep we are
05:20 - gonna be going over that math so we can
05:21 - specifically kind of look at what kind
05:23 - of numbers you could be looking at and
05:24 - again I'm gonna give you your Python
05:26 - earning potential calculator so you can
05:29 - see how it works
05:37 - yep you're welcome the decoder and if
05:44 - you want to jump in there and answer
05:45 - some questions for people who are live
05:48 - that'd be great and you can also log in
05:52 - Sinclair on my accounts and he can also
05:55 - help out with the questions on YouTube
05:57 - he can help out with the questions on
05:58 - Facebook or Instagram
06:09 - yeah so what when that course is
06:12 - released to create apps and land your
06:14 - first client with Python course that
06:16 - course is not live course it's you know
06:21 - you get lifetime access to it so you
06:23 - don't have to worry about if you have
06:25 - exams or you have something going on
06:27 - right now you don't have to watch it at
06:30 - this moment you could take it at your
06:31 - own pace okay so even though we are
06:34 - gonna be it's gonna be like a few weeks
06:37 - long course you can take it at your own
06:38 - pace all right so why the best
06:45 - programmers are broke and one of the
06:49 - main things is so basically you know I'm
06:52 - talking about the people who have been
06:53 - coding let's say for 30 years and their
06:55 - rate is thirty dollars an hour and I
07:00 - know that because I actually had a few
07:02 - coding pewters or mentors that I had
07:05 - hired and I was working with and that
07:08 - was a rate they were charging and we're
07:11 - very closely with them for a few for a
07:14 - few years actually and I was looking at
07:18 - I had one mentor who was essentially
07:20 - broke who was a great coder with 30
07:24 - years of experience making $30 an hour
07:27 - then I had another mentor who had you
07:30 - know only few years of coding experience
07:32 - but then he was charging 150 to 200
07:36 - dollars an hour as a Python consultant
07:39 - he even had clients who charged $300 an
07:42 - hour as a Python consultant and that's
07:45 - what made me you know started thinking
07:47 - about okay hmm you can have somebody who
07:50 - has fifteen thirteen thirty years of
07:54 - experience and you can have somebody who
07:56 - has less experience and are actually
07:57 - less hot you know less good coders
08:01 - they're not as good as somebody else who
08:03 - has 30 years of experience but how are
08:06 - they when it comes to the pay so
08:09 - different like what is the difference
08:11 - they live in the same country they live
08:13 - in the same state they live in the same
08:14 - city they have a room to apply to the
08:17 - same pool of jobs so what's with the
08:20 - disparity why is one guy make
08:23 - five times as much and other guy making
08:27 - five times as less why does it take one
08:30 - person to do in five years what it takes
08:34 - other person to do in one year
08:36 - why does it take one person to do in two
08:39 - years what it takes other person to do
08:42 - in ten years what the hell is the
08:48 - difference what is it so if you guys
08:52 - have some thoughts on what that
08:53 - difference could be why there's such a
08:56 - disparity and why we see that put it in
09:00 - the comments below
09:01 - tell me what you think the difference is
09:04 - okay and then I'll chip in and give my
09:06 - opinion for it as well
09:19 - so some people are saying what you
09:21 - studied cool
09:29 - some people say experience effort
09:35 - ideology cool still waiting on the
09:40 - YouTube comments alright people are like
09:45 - I don't know
09:47 - creativity cool we're getting we're
09:49 - getting some stuff going in Facebook not
09:51 - hearing from you guys what do you guys
09:53 - think it is what do you guys think that
09:56 - difference is where somebody could get
09:58 - that huge jump even though they have a
10:03 - lot less experience even though they're
10:05 - not as good coders some people are
10:06 - saying dedication of time some people
10:09 - are saying self-confidence
10:10 - entrepreneurship the difference is
10:14 - probably having insight in the industry
10:17 - smart work
10:27 - okay
10:30 - all right so here's it what in my
10:33 - opinion what the difference is it's a
10:42 - lot of self limiting belief that people
10:44 - put on themselves okay and it's a lot of
10:47 - here's what the most important thing
10:50 - that I think people overlook 85% of your
10:55 - financial success and listen to this
10:59 - very carefully and if you're watching
11:01 - this live stream here's what I suggest
11:03 - bring um bring some notes with you bring
11:06 - a notepad and take some notes all right
11:09 - write down what I'm saying and this will
11:11 - really really help you 85% of your
11:16 - financial success comes from your
11:21 - personal likeability your interpersonal
11:26 - skills your people skills your
11:32 - negotiation skills all right and the
11:38 - other 15% of your financial success
11:41 - comes from your technical skills how
11:49 - crazy is that and this is it this is
11:52 - according to Carnegie Mellon University
11:53 - they did a research and that's what they
11:55 - put out and I think it's true
12:01 - it's the 80/20 rule 85 15 in this case
12:05 - but that's really what it is quality of
12:09 - work of course it matters your
12:12 - dedication of course it matters your
12:14 - time of course it matters but how come
12:17 - the dude who's put 30 years into coding
12:19 - and literally codes every single day has
12:22 - eyebags underneath his eyes doesn't even
12:26 - change his shirt like this guy literally
12:28 - was my mentor and I hope he's not
12:30 - watching it um and I love him to death
12:33 - but he literally wore a blue hoodie
12:36 - every single session we've ever had okay
12:42 - and like had crazy eye bags under his
12:44 - eyes and he was the best coder I've
12:47 - literally ever seen okay this guy was
12:50 - like a wizard
12:51 - he'd been coding since he was five years
12:53 - old and he'd been coding all the way
12:55 - through and his work experience was 30
12:58 - years so I imagine that you've been
12:59 - coding from five since you were five
13:01 - years old and then you also have
13:03 - professional job experience for 30 years
13:05 - so he was probably coding for over 40
13:08 - years okay
13:12 - yet that was his hourly rate and again
13:16 - you know why is money important a lot of
13:20 - people are like why are you talking
13:22 - about money why do you bring up money so
13:24 - much here's why because I care about you
13:28 - being able to support yourself but not
13:30 - only that you being able to support your
13:33 - family and your friends
13:35 - okay those around you this was something
13:39 - I kind of figured out or it happened to
13:42 - me and I had this realization a while
13:44 - ago and I've told this story where my
13:47 - mom got an accident and I couldn't
13:48 - afford her surgery like literally our
13:50 - family couldn't afford her surgery so
13:52 - for 12 years like she just kept being an
13:56 - agonizing pain and me feeling helpless
13:59 - was the moment for me where I realized
14:01 - that I only need a little bit of money
14:04 - to be happy and I just need to eat food
14:06 - and that's pretty much it and I'll be
14:08 - like good but I need to have more for
14:11 - other people around me and not just
14:14 - enough for myself because I think that's
14:16 - selfish to just have enough for yourself
14:18 - so now going back to the two programmers
14:22 - right one making 30 and other making
14:24 - like 200 an hour
14:25 - that's literally one person's one year
14:28 - of work is equal to the other person six
14:30 - years of work so you're saving yourself
14:31 - a lot of time which gives you freedom
14:34 - you're obviously making good money so
14:36 - you get paid what you deserve you're not
14:38 - overworked and underpaid and you can
14:40 - help out everybody else around you and
14:42 - also you're like I said you have that
14:48 - freedom and that freedom is what we
14:51 - really want right that's what we're
14:53 - alternately looking for
14:55 - and here's what I like about it the most
14:57 - when you're getting compensated well for
15:01 - your time you end up having a lot of
15:03 - extra free time and now with that time
15:06 - you can choose to put in a lot more work
15:08 - maybe even build a business on the side
15:11 - or work on really cool coding projects
15:14 - like nerd out whatever but you could
15:15 - work on your own things and that's the
15:19 - freedom that I like you know for example
15:21 - if you're charging let's say let's say
15:24 - you're happy with making $2,000 a month
15:26 - ok let's just talk about some practical
15:28 - math now let's say you're happy and you
15:32 - enjoy making $2,000 a month and you
15:34 - figure it out the - what would keep you
15:36 - happy you could be working 40 hours to
15:40 - make you could be working 40 hours a
15:43 - week to make your $2,000 a month so
15:46 - let's say you could be working 160 hours
15:48 - a month to be making your $2,000 or
15:54 - instead of working hundred and 60 hours
15:56 - a month how about if you had a higher
15:58 - hourly rate that you charge how about
16:02 - you worked for only 40 hours and made
16:06 - $2,000 how about instead of your
16:09 - workweek being 40 hours long your
16:12 - workweek was 10 hours long and you get
16:15 - 30 hours extra now you could take that
16:18 - extra 30 hours and put it towards work
16:21 - and now instead of working 10 hours
16:23 - you're working 40 hours but your income
16:25 - instead of it being 2,000 it's now
16:27 - $8,000 that's one thing you could do the
16:31 - other thing you could do with that 30
16:32 - hours is literally start going to the
16:35 - gym that time you complain you don't
16:37 - have enough hours in a day to spend with
16:39 - your family friends or your girlfriend
16:42 - whatever take care of that I don't know
16:47 - the third thing is enjoy your life like
16:51 - travel go to different places go to
16:54 - different states go to different
16:55 - countries see what is going on in the
16:58 - world check out different cultures it's
17:03 - unlimited which you could do at that
17:04 - time so that's why it's important to
17:08 - understand and
17:09 - what your earning potential could look
17:11 - like so you have this clear map because
17:14 - most people what you what we do is we
17:18 - just applied lots and lots and lots of
17:20 - jobs and then the first one that comes
17:23 - to us we just accept that and it can
17:28 - even be like some really crappy
17:29 - opportunity and then we just go from
17:32 - there
17:34 - right and then we just go day by day not
17:38 - thinking about what we're doing we work
17:40 - we come home we watch stranger things or
17:43 - house of cards and there's nothing wrong
17:45 - with that if you're watching it from a
17:47 - place of just enjoying it but most of
17:50 - the times our lives are so hectic that
17:53 - we literally need to numb the pain
17:56 - by watching some stuff to keep our minds
17:59 - off of the pressure and the headaches
18:02 - and all the problems so we come home
18:05 - from 9:00 to 5:00 a job that we uh-huh
18:08 - we're like it's okay I'm not really
18:11 - feeling it we spend the rest of the time
18:14 - maybe watching a show or something and
18:15 - then we sleep and then we rinse and
18:17 - repeat and go through life like zombies
18:21 - and then we look back and we're like I
18:23 - have an average job that pays an average
18:26 - income I have you know either a partner
18:32 - in life or I maybe don't even have a
18:34 - partner in life I'm physically in just
18:38 - an okay shape if not poor shape and I
18:42 - wish I could do a lot of the things
18:45 - differently and then as soon as that
18:49 - thought creeps into your mind what do
18:51 - you do
18:52 - boom back to Netflix back to watching
18:57 - the TV back to watching your favorite
18:59 - reality show back to calling that best
19:02 - friend that just makes you feel
19:03 - comfortable and feel good and you guys
19:05 - just eat cookies together and you guys
19:08 - just like hang out together and eat ice
19:10 - cream together and both of you try not
19:13 - to remind each other of where were the
19:15 - places where you could have really
19:17 - succeeded and pushed yourself and had
19:19 - that tapped into that potential that you
19:22 - know
19:22 - you kind of had so again it's important
19:30 - to understand that and not go down that
19:34 - path okay just have always have that in
19:37 - the back of your head and like I say
19:39 - you're true friends are not the ones who
19:41 - make you feel comfortable or cuddly or
19:43 - just enjoying yourself
19:45 - those are people you can I mean I
19:48 - honestly hire just hire a therapist or
19:51 - something just pay them hourly to listen
19:53 - to your problems it'll make you feel
19:55 - nice and cushy they'll make you feel
19:57 - cozy you'll be great
19:59 - if you make money you can just hire them
20:00 - that's it that's the type of friends I
20:03 - see a lot of people have just just
20:05 - always trying to make each other feel as
20:06 - comfortable as possible only to then
20:09 - later look back at their life and then
20:11 - regret it
20:12 - I honestly think a true friend is
20:14 - somebody who pushes you and makes you
20:16 - feel uncomfortable not all the time but
20:19 - at times calls you out and it's okay if
20:22 - they make you feel a little
20:23 - uncomfortable but enough to challenge
20:25 - you so you can push yourself forward in
20:28 - in your income in your financial success
20:33 - in your relationships in your you know
20:39 - your body your fitness in your emotional
20:41 - health your mental health whether you do
20:44 - meditation or whatever it is in every
20:47 - aspect of life you should be around
20:49 - people who push you forward and truly
20:52 - care for you that's what it means for
20:54 - somebody to truly care for you like they
20:56 - watch out for you okay so keep that in
21:03 - the back of your mind
21:04 - yeah Netflix Netflix is too expensive
21:06 - for some some of us
21:08 - jaunty so again when you're working on
21:10 - those little apps on the side and you're
21:13 - freelancing you could be making that
21:15 - extra income and then just pay off that
21:17 - Netflix pay off your Hulu subscriptions
21:22 - pay off going to movies pay off those
21:27 - fancy dinner dates pay off your phone
21:29 - bills pay off all these annoying little
21:32 - things that nag at you and even if you
21:35 - do
21:35 - ready to make that full jump yet you
21:38 - could be doing this on the side and save
21:41 - yourself time and just be making that
21:43 - extra income to give yourself that
21:44 - breathing room
21:45 - okay all right here's what I want to
21:52 - talk about now so let's talk a little
21:54 - bit about the calculator that I've put
21:58 - together for you guys and let's talk
22:02 - about your earning let's talk about the
22:04 - money you could be making okay and
22:05 - before I do that one second what's the
22:07 - pho in the in the Facebook it's not
22:10 - really a free program it's just like a
22:12 - free master class we've put together for
22:14 - them so just change it if it doesn't
22:16 - take too long okay so let's talk about
22:20 - kind of your earning potential that you
22:22 - guys could have all right as a Python
22:26 - freelancer you could be charging the
22:31 - normal Python freelancer rate which for
22:35 - whatever reason is not available online
22:37 - I had to find out from my mentor and
22:39 - this was something that helped me you
22:42 - know I've told that story where I was on
22:43 - a phone call and I went from literally
22:46 - $50 an hour and I talked with my mentor
22:49 - he's like go 200 he's like no he goes I
22:52 - don't care how little experience you
22:54 - have you've only been in coding for
22:56 - three months whatever he goes doesn't
22:58 - matter they're trying to you $50 an
23:01 - hour for a Python freelancer is not
23:03 - right 150 an hour is what a Python
23:07 - freelancer should be making if not more
23:10 - so he goes I know you have less
23:12 - experience if you don't feel comfortable
23:13 - 150 just go with a hundred so I didn't
23:16 - feel comfortable at that point to go to
23:18 - 150 I wasn't sure about my skills I got
23:22 - on this phone call and I said hey it was
23:25 - a scary phone call I've talked about
23:27 - this literally my hands were shaking I
23:28 - was like deathly scared and I went I'm
23:31 - like hey so that $50 an hour rate we
23:36 - agreed on yeah that was just like my
23:41 - rate for doing like tutoring or coaching
23:45 - students but for my Python consulting
23:47 - rate I'm gonna charge 100
23:49 - an hour and if that's okay with you we
23:51 - can move forward otherwise you know we
23:54 - can't and then on the other side he just
23:57 - goes he goes okay we'll see if it's in
24:01 - the budget and hangs up and keep in mind
24:02 - I'm a college student with a 2.0 GPA I
24:06 - don't have a fancy degree I don't even
24:08 - have my associate degree yet I'm in my
24:10 - second year at college and for those of
24:14 - you guys know who don't know what a 2.0
24:16 - GPA means it just means you're a
24:17 - terrible student okay just take it like
24:19 - that and for me this is opportunity of a
24:23 - lifetime and I'm getting on this call
24:25 - and going from 50 to 100 it's a scary
24:26 - jump but the next day I received a
24:30 - message to set congratulations and you
24:33 - start this Wednesday and when I got that
24:37 - message I just saw it from the
24:38 - notification at the top of my phone I
24:41 - mean it was just like I was sweating you
24:43 - know for the whole day and then it just
24:45 - all that tension all the headache just
24:47 - gone and then eventually I started
24:49 - realizing it's not really that big a
24:51 - deal to charge a hundred dollars an hour
24:53 - though it was scary for me and also that
24:58 - shows the power of having mentors
25:00 - because everybody else to me was just
25:01 - saying you're looking a gift horse in
25:03 - the mouth you're ungrateful and don't
25:06 - charge that much just accept what they
25:08 - have offered you already especially as
25:10 - that student okay alright so now I want
25:17 - to now and tell you this $50 an hour is
25:20 - a pretty low rate for a Python
25:22 - freelancer to charge really low rate but
25:23 - let's say you start at that rate cool
25:26 - you start at the $50 an hour rate
25:29 - somebody said give some other examples
25:32 - other examples of people who charge so
25:36 - yeah I'm giving you another example so
25:37 - one of my mentors charge $30 an hour
25:39 - another one charged $200 an hour as a
25:43 - Python consultant I had a mentor who
25:45 - charge $300 a Python consultant I know
25:50 - of many people who charge 70 or 80
25:53 - dollars an hour I know because I've
25:55 - hired software developers and they
25:58 - worked for me and I paid them 70 to 80
26:00 - dollars an hour to work for me on Pi
26:03 - on projects so $50 is a pretty low rate
26:07 - and again the 70 $80 in our people some
26:12 - of them are wearing in United States and
26:14 - some I hired that were actually in India
26:16 - but it doesn't matter to me and it
26:18 - doesn't matter to a lot of people are
26:20 - hiring these freelancers they don't care
26:21 - what country you're in as long as you're
26:23 - good okay and as long as you can
26:25 - communicate that to them all right and
26:29 - you can get the job done so anyways
26:35 - lower hourly rate is 50 now let's say
26:38 - you have one client at $50 an hour let's
26:42 - say you land you spend the next few
26:44 - months and you get only one client okay
26:46 - you you try really hard but you only get
26:49 - one client for one or two three months
26:50 - you try
26:51 - one client at $50 an hour and let's say
26:55 - they don't give you 40 hours of work
26:57 - let's say they don't give you 30 hours
26:59 - of work let's say they don't give you 20
27:00 - hours of work let's say they are only
27:03 - giving you 10 hours of work per week if
27:08 - you're charging them $50 an hour that's
27:13 - $500 okay in one week for 10 hours of
27:19 - work and that's $2,000 a month okay I'm
27:29 - gonna say this again one client at $50
27:32 - an hour for 10 hours of work per week
27:36 - gives you $2,000 a month
27:39 - write this down just like that
27:44 - you can then do the math - what can
27:45 - happen as you add more clients or as you
27:47 - increase the income or as you increase
27:49 - the hours the $2,000 a month is $24,000
27:55 - in one full year I know that there's
27:59 - some people who are watching this right
28:01 - now that don't make $24,000 in one full
28:04 - year and you could do this with one
28:06 - client and you could do this with
28:09 - something that's actually enjoyable and
28:11 - fun you could be working on a security
28:13 - project you could be building a social
28:14 - media app for what
28:16 - you could be working with the team who's
28:19 - building a social media app so it's not
28:20 - even that hard you just communicate with
28:22 - them and they like you they just tell
28:23 - you what to do in the train you and you
28:25 - pick up those skills and then you start
28:27 - putting in that work and giving them
28:29 - what they need again it's not easy it's
28:31 - hard okay
28:33 - but if you follow this path okay and you
28:37 - use this this is possible all right it's
28:42 - doable the reason why when I say is not
28:44 - easy as I don't want people to come into
28:46 - this with like no intention of putting
28:49 - in any work you just want to like be
28:51 - lazy you want to be doing exactly what
28:52 - you're doing right now
28:53 - and for some reason come in here and
28:55 - think you're just gonna get massively
28:57 - different results if you start taking
28:59 - action on this and actually doing these
29:01 - things you'll get those results fast but
29:03 - again this is just one client I'm
29:06 - talking about all right
29:08 - $24,000 extra a year could mean you
29:10 - could start up extra business on the
29:12 - side could mean you could pay off all
29:15 - these annoying things that you don't
29:16 - like or it could mean you could pay off
29:18 - the mortgage or you know get a nice
29:21 - apartment that you don't even have to
29:22 - worry about it essentially free again
29:26 - what I've done for you is I've put
29:28 - together your Python earning potential
29:30 - calculator and that's in the description
29:33 - below or if you're watching this on
29:36 - Instagram that's in the live bio what
29:39 - happens is on on YouTube I'm going to
29:43 - show you this what happens is when you
29:46 - go to this page so whatever link I have
29:48 - on Instagram and Facebook if you guys
29:50 - click it and YouTube if you guys click
29:53 - it you're gonna go to a page and the
29:55 - page says free masterclass the
29:58 - profitable programmer go from zero
30:00 - coding skills to landing your first
30:02 - client with Python in under 90 days you
30:05 - put in your name you put in your email
30:07 - all right those are the only two things
30:10 - you have to do then you click get
30:12 - instant access after that you get my
30:16 - your Python potential video that I've
30:19 - put together for you literally spent
30:20 - weeks and months working on this thing
30:23 - all right
30:24 - it's awesome and it's really gonna show
30:27 - you the road map that you need to be
30:28 - following to land
30:29 - first client in less than 90 days and
30:33 - underneath the video I have your Python
30:36 - potential calculator and for those of
30:40 - you who want to figure out your Python
30:42 - developer lifestyle you want to figure
30:43 - out whether you should be you know you
30:46 - maybe you're gonna be a freelancer maybe
30:48 - you want to be a full-time developer
30:49 - with Python maybe you want to be a site
30:52 - hustler maybe you want to even know why
30:55 - Python okay why are we choosing the
30:58 - language Python why not JavaScript why
31:01 - not some other language okay
31:03 - why is Python the best language of 2017
31:06 - and is growing to be the number one
31:08 - language as the years you know proceed
31:12 - and we get closer to 2020 all of that is
31:16 - gonna be on this page for you put in
31:18 - your name you put in your email you
31:20 - unlock access to my profitable
31:22 - programmer master class that I've put
31:24 - together for you along with your Python
31:28 - earning potential calculator and I also
31:30 - give you that Python potential worksheet
31:33 - so you can figure out your lifestyle and
31:35 - you can figure out what this could do
31:36 - for your family and you could figure out
31:38 - how much money you could be making and
31:40 - what kind of projects you're gonna be
31:42 - working on all of this I've put together
31:46 - for you for absolutely free all right
31:50 - and they'll be crazy for you to not take
31:53 - advantage of this go right now

32:59 - nice
33:01 - cool cool cool the decoder I got it you
33:04 - don't have to spam the section oh really
33:10 - great yo when will the course release on
33:12 - Instagram
33:13 - say you'd asks when will the course
33:15 - release mid-november
33:17 - that's when the course will release
33:19 - abhishekh great yes I've done it awesome
33:24 - armour Khan says man this calculator is
33:27 - amazing great
33:31 - cool coach Patel says cucumber I think
33:35 - that means no because cucumber wasn't an
33:39 - option John says exceedingly nice
33:43 - I took it many days ago and it's very
33:46 - good see the wizzy is telling you guys
33:48 - it's very good yeah and if you guys have
33:55 - belief like if you guys are thinking you
33:57 - know maybe you're too young or too old
33:59 - it's for anybody from you know whether
34:02 - you're trying to go to high school or if
34:04 - you're even younger or you're thinking
34:05 - of retiring I've put it together for
34:08 - everybody dependent regardless of how
34:10 - old you are what your age is okay if
34:15 - you're like 15 you're not gonna be able
34:17 - to well you can actually still Python
34:19 - freelance as early as 15 so I'm not
34:21 - gonna put a limit on that at 9 it
34:24 - probably is illegal right but even if
34:26 - you're 9 you could get a lot of real
34:28 - practical skills and starting around 10
34:32 - or 11 you can start working on building
34:34 - your own business I had a 9 year old who
34:36 - took my class master class actually and
34:38 - he emailed me he's like Kazi and I'm 9
34:42 - and he's like I'm learning about he goes
34:44 - my earning potential he's like it's he
34:47 - says it's like $300 a month and I was
34:49 - like oh that's cool that's 300 extra
34:51 - dollars and that was exciting but yeah I
34:55 - mean it's uh you know as a business you
34:58 - could start working as a business if
34:59 - you're really young I mean you can't
35:02 - even legally get a job yet you can start
35:04 - to work as a business I had a 15 year
35:06 - old who was designing some stripe like a
35:09 - while ago hit me up on clever programmer
35:11 - comm and he even wanted to work with me
35:13 - but he was a
35:15 - fifteen year old he had put together a
35:17 - platform kind of similar to stripe for
35:20 - Russia and this kid was making like
35:22 - fifty thousand dollars a month and he
35:25 - wanted to even hire me to work on this
35:27 - project but at that time I was working
35:29 - on clever programmer so I couldn't do it
35:31 - but yeah he was a programmer and he was
35:35 - killing it but it but yeah you know
35:38 - sometimes you could even build your own
35:40 - thing and what's your Python earning
35:43 - potential if any of you guys have opened
35:45 - my page and have gone to the calculator
35:47 - and if calculated earning potential or
35:49 - maybe you have launched a video already
35:50 - and done it
35:51 - what's your earning potential put it in
35:54 - the comments put it in the YouTube
35:56 - comments put it in the Facebook comments
35:58 - I want to know what your earning
36:00 - potential what you're thinking it is and
36:01 - even if you haven't gone through the
36:02 - calculator let me know what you think it
36:05 - is here's the link YouTube
36:10 - press that goddamn button right here hmm
36:14 - go on this page and sign up okay do it
36:17 - and can you look at the emails we have
36:22 - now and then then make a note of it for
36:26 - today and then it will take off okay so
36:30 - second our second part is gonna be
36:33 - released tomorrow November 5th 11 a.m.
36:38 - stop it everything you're doing and put
36:41 - it in your calendar the second part of
36:43 - this video is absolutely mind-blowing if
36:47 - you thought the first part if you think
36:49 - this livestream was good if you think
36:51 - that your Python potential video the
36:54 - part one of the masterclass is good just
36:57 - wait till the second part the second
37:00 - part is gonna absolutely blow your mind
37:02 - okay as I said earlier it's gonna blow
37:05 - your brains out well my friend said that
37:07 - that's pretty aggressive so I'm gonna
37:08 - hold back on that one
37:09 - but this one is gonna blow your freaking
37:11 - mind I mean you guys are just not ready
37:13 - for it you guys are not ready for it I'm
37:15 - honest go sign up and just watch it I
37:19 - mean it's exciting as hell it's tomorrow
37:21 - literally I'm like yeah we have been
37:24 - working around the clock if you've been
37:25 - watching my Instagram or Facebook or
37:28 - whatever
37:28 - snapchats you guys see us in the office
37:31 - I'm with my entire team and we're
37:33 - literally working 20 to 30 hours a day I
37:38 - think yesterday what did we do 40 hours
37:41 - we didn't sleep like we literally did
37:44 - not sleep for like two days and we're
37:48 - fine we're completely okay but we work
37:51 - really hard to put a lot of this
37:52 - together and make it just awesome for
37:55 - you guys all right and again it's very
37:58 - practical so it's not just fun and
38:00 - amazing stuff even though that's in
38:02 - there but it's a lot about your earning
38:04 - potential what kind of jobs you could be
38:06 - doing what type of developer do
38:08 - developer do you want to be what kind of
38:11 - companies you're looking to work at how
38:13 - soon you can get started how you can get
38:15 - your first client in less than 90 days
38:17 - get that first paycheck and it's
38:19 - actually you know very realistic I go
38:21 - through the math I also show you
38:23 - literally the code I use to land my
38:26 - first client who paid me $20,000 with
38:29 - two months of work coding I show you
38:31 - literally the code I used okay and with
38:35 - that I also prove to you that coding is
38:38 - actually really easy doesn't require you
38:40 - to be some kind of weird rocket
38:42 - scientist mathematician some complicated
38:45 - genius it's just what coders make you
38:47 - want to believe so they can hold on to
38:50 - their self esteems that's it okay that's
38:53 - literally it they just care about their
38:55 - ego and their self esteem but I don't I
38:59 - don't care about my ego or self-esteem
39:00 - and I'm just gonna show you guys
39:02 - literally what it takes it's like pretty
39:05 - easy all you need to do is just spend
39:08 - time coding you know and learning this
39:11 - and following the path then I'm gonna
39:13 - show you in these videos
39:19 - yeah no no math is required okay
39:23 - math was one of my weakest subjects in
39:25 - college it was never really like I don't
39:29 - know it never really clicked with me
39:32 - maybe I'm just a bad student
39:34 - but yeah math is not my strong suit
39:37 - thing but I was in Oakland Community
39:40 - College and in one year I made a hundred
39:43 - and four thousand dollars okay and just
39:45 - one year at Oakland Community College
39:48 - doing Python freelancing so just connect
39:51 - the dots bad at math you know kind of a
39:54 - dumb college kid but this is possible
39:57 - again it's not one of those like things
40:00 - I for me it was really really hard to
40:03 - figure it out because I didn't have like
40:05 - I didn't know what were the steps I
40:07 - needed to take and everybody in the
40:09 - world makes it so complicated and all
40:11 - the online courses just gave me all this
40:13 - theory and didn't connect the dots for
40:15 - me like okay I know how to write a
40:17 - Fibonacci recursive solution but how the
40:20 - hell do I charge somebody for it and
40:24 - then I looked online and there's not a
40:26 - single job that's like I need you to
40:28 - write me off a Bonacci recursive
40:29 - solution and I spent literally weeks
40:31 - trying to figure it out
40:33 - so it's certain things then I realize
40:36 - are not necessary if you look at my code
40:39 - that I show you the behind-the-scenes of
40:42 - PLC to what you're gonna see tomorrow is
40:45 - gonna get released it's super simple
40:49 - stuff what I'm showing you obviously if
40:53 - you're good at math you'll have an extra
40:55 - advantage and you can be working on even
40:57 - like you know cool projects that require
41:00 - math you can be working on like data
41:01 - sciency stuff using Python there's
41:04 - nothing wrong with knowing math or
41:06 - liking math or even loving it you can go
41:09 - down that path but I'm telling you
41:12 - there's also a path where that's not
41:14 - necessary and you can get jobs you can
41:17 - use libraries in code it's called
41:19 - libraries and you can import them into
41:21 - your code and literally just use them
41:24 - and how I like to put it it's some
41:27 - developers who have lost their sleep for
41:32 - weeks and months
41:33 - writing this library for you that does
41:35 - all the math they're literally like
41:36 - probably got got in a divorce because
41:39 - they spend so much time coding these
41:41 - things up and you get to write these few
41:43 - commands like import in Python that
41:45 - imports all of the library and you can
41:48 - just leverage that code so all the math
41:50 - a lot of the times it's handled
41:52 - with the libraries you're using for
41:54 - example I'm not good at math but I can
41:56 - even put together image recognition and
41:58 - video recognition software without
42:01 - knowing any math I just import these
42:03 - libraries with Python and then boom boom
42:06 - boom I just go and use them there's a
42:08 - library called OpenCV in Python for
42:11 - example and I just imported in a simple
42:13 - code that I write and then it does image
42:15 - recognition so again guys a lot of it is
42:19 - not as hard as people make it out to be
42:21 - as classes make it out to be and that's
42:24 - really what I want to show you and if
42:26 - you want to learn this stuff and you're
42:27 - serious about it click on the link in
42:30 - bio on Instagram click on the
42:32 - description in facebook facebook and
42:36 - youtube and sign up for the master class
42:38 - that i have open right here for you
42:50 - and yeah so basically my goal is to give
42:53 - you the whole roadmap of what you need
42:56 - okay
42:56 - and in PLC 2 I forgot to mention right
43:02 - there are gonna be some other freaking
43:04 - amazing things I'm giving you guys
43:06 - literally you can steal this thing I'm
43:08 - gonna be giving you guys a full on
43:10 - portfolio and it's special specially
43:15 - designed for Python freelancers I've
43:18 - interviewed so many developers to get
43:22 - the best aspects of like what it takes
43:24 - to put in a portfolio that can almost
43:26 - sell itself alright and requires you to
43:29 - not even learn all those crazy
43:31 - negotiation skills it sells itself by
43:33 - somebody looking at it I've gotten jobs
43:36 - using this portfolio and my close
43:38 - friends have gotten jobs using this
43:40 - portfolio and we've taken all of this
43:43 - and put it together and we're gonna be
43:45 - giving it away literally giving it away
43:48 - with video instructions on how to use
43:50 - this portfolio in PLC 2 so I just don't
43:55 - know how to make it any better and give
43:57 - you guys more value and you're gonna be
43:59 - getting all of this for free ok and the
44:03 - road map and all of that stuff so I'm
44:05 - really excited I mean these master this
44:07 - master class is phenomenal the videos
44:09 - will be amazing and it took a lot a lot
44:13 - a lot a lot a lot of hard work to put it
44:15 - together but we wanted to make sure that
44:16 - it's perfect and it's ready to go and
44:19 - then as you build your career as a
44:21 - Python freelancer I've made this
44:23 - portfolio in a way where you can
44:24 - literally plug and chug okay you can
44:28 - literally plug and chug your projects so
44:30 - it has a my work section and you can
44:32 - just go in boom boom boom boom plug and
44:35 - chug your Python projects and it'll show
44:38 - all your my work as a Python freelancer
44:40 - and then you just link this to other
44:41 - people cool and so for example if you
44:45 - want to get started with things like
44:46 - upward calm and freelancing there you
44:50 - can link this to people and I'm gonna
44:51 - show you much better ways to freelance
44:54 - than up work okay that's just one way to
44:56 - do it and I'm gonna show you guys how to
44:59 - even get jobs on places like up work and
45:01 - all that but that's the up work part or
45:03 - what
45:04 - ever is not covered in the master class
45:06 - but I will show you the portfolio's and
45:08 - things that you need to get going and
45:10 - then you can use them in places like up
45:12 - work okay
45:25 - yep so Python again the reason why we
45:28 - chose Python Python is um you know like
45:36 - I like to say it it's at the
45:38 - intersection of being the easiest
45:40 - programming language being the most paid
45:44 - or one of the most paid programming
45:46 - languages average Python web developer
45:49 - makes a hundred and ten thousand dollars
45:52 - plus every year according to indeed.com
45:58 - okay a Python web developer on average
46:03 - makes a hundred and ten thousand dollars
46:06 - a year according to indeed.com okay you
46:10 - could be on the higher side of that why
46:12 - not all right
46:14 - but that's average developer and that's
46:16 - regardless of where you are living you
46:18 - don't need to be living in United States
46:20 - or a specific spot to be earning that
46:24 - income you could be living in a
46:26 - different part of the world you could be
46:27 - living in Pakistan you could be living
46:29 - in Sri Lanka you could be living in
46:32 - United Kingdom you could be living in
46:34 - India it does not matter that potential
46:38 - is possible for you that's one of the
46:41 - benefits of software developers that
46:43 - they have you can work remotely
46:57 - captain looper asks so now I'm gonna
46:59 - take some Q&A is okay and I'm gonna
47:02 - answer those for you guys why are we not
47:05 - getting any comments on Facebook oh you

47:58 - know where to start now on Facebook list
48:00 - some books for Python one of the books I
48:03 - like lots of books but by John Zell I
48:07 - don't have it right here with me hey
48:09 - Sinclair can you see it says computer
48:11 - science and Python on it and it says by
48:13 - John Zell and make sure the light
48:15 - doesn't drop yeah do you it should it
48:22 - shouldn't be anywhere crazy just one
48:27 - second I'll get the book for you guys
48:36 - yes so this is one book I recommend to
48:39 - you guys it's a really good book I like
48:41 - it a lot I've used it it's not showing
48:44 - clearly on okay it's showing clearly on
48:47 - YouTube it's showing clearly on
48:50 - Instagram they can't see the Oh with
48:52 - them okay now they can see it and fish
48:57 - on clearly alright
48:59 - it's called Python programming and it's
49:01 - by John Zell and you can just get the
49:04 - newest edition and I really like this
49:07 - book it doesn't show you how to get
49:09 - clients
49:10 - anything like that but it takes you
49:11 - through some of the basics of computer
49:13 - programming and it's cool but I'm not
49:17 - really crazy about books I'm more about
49:19 - watching stuff from videos and learning
49:21 - that way so that's why everything I've
49:23 - put together for you guys is you know
49:26 - for video with the video that goes along
49:29 - with everything so you know I'm gonna be
49:32 - showing you all the Python I'm gonna be
49:36 - showing you all the coding stuff but
49:38 - then I'm gonna be spending the right
49:39 - amount of time showing you guys the
49:40 - stuff where you can actually get how you
49:43 - guys can actually get clients how you
49:45 - can get build the client getting system
49:47 - so that gets you like this endless
49:50 - stream of clients without you even
49:51 - necessarily putting in a lot of work it
49:54 - can be automated and I'm gonna be
49:56 - showing you guys some interviews with
49:58 - the top Python developers and
50:00 - freelancers and you know that stuff
50:03 - again comes later that stuff is not in
50:05 - master class I'm getting ahead of myself
50:07 - I'm just really excited but in the
50:09 - master class I have put a lot of stuff
50:11 - in there for you guys okay your Python
50:13 - potential worksheet that helps you
50:15 - figure out your Python developer
50:16 - lifestyle your Python potential
50:19 - calculator that's part 1 part 2 of the
50:22 - video why the best programmers are broke
50:25 - or you're unfair advantage the part 2
50:28 - which gets released tomorrow
50:29 - in part 2 we talked about building your
50:32 - Python freelancer portfolio and I
50:35 - literally give it to you so you can plug
50:37 - and chug it and I give you a lot of
50:40 - other amazing stuff one of the things
50:42 - being I literally show you the code for
50:45 - the project I built that the client who
50:48 - paid me twenty thousand dollars for less
50:50 - than two months of work and I'm gonna
50:53 - show you how I landed that client
50:55 - because I had only spent ninety days
50:59 - learning and then I landed this client
51:01 - okay I just started from zero coding
51:03 - skills I'd spent 90 days learning coding
51:06 - and then I landed this client and I'll
51:08 - show you how my mentor helped me with
51:10 - that and how I got that so you two can
51:12 - make that happen for yourself

63:08 - it's picking it up when will we get
63:13 - second class of Python course second
63:15 - class comes out tomorrow what are the
63:19 - questions here how can we make code
63:20 - slowing our mind for every problem sir
63:22 - be Sony there's a website called code to
63:25 - flow I think Co de the number 2 and then
63:30 - the word flow comm so code to flow calm
63:35 - let me just double check I'm not lying
63:38 - and basically what it allows you to do
63:43 - is really easily
63:47 - yeah just make these little flow charts
63:50 - and instantly and yeah I really like it
63:54 - so sir B maybe you could use that okay
63:58 - check it out type that into the Facebook
64:01 - thing
64:01 - are you on Facebook - okay just type
64:04 - that into the Facebook oh this is
64:07 - awesome - almost says hey I'm gonna
64:08 - start donating soon as well I can donate
64:10 - in pounds right of course yes you can
64:15 - this is so cool I don't even care how
64:18 - much they pay me it's just like so fun
64:20 - to look at it it's like super chat I
64:23 - know that's what I'm selling you donate
64:26 - it twice that's so awesome thank you I
64:27 - appreciate it it's just fun like there's
64:30 - something about it it's like addicting
64:32 - it's like you know when you're playing
64:34 - video game sometimes and you get that
64:36 - achievement you know it's kind of like
64:38 - that
64:40 - ha Koons asks how long did it take you
64:44 - to learn and all question in all caps
64:46 - and in double question marks I don't
64:49 - guys don't be like desperate to get your
64:53 - question out there just ask calmly
64:55 - because this is something important I
64:58 - want to tell you because when you come
64:59 - off desperate and needy like this I
65:01 - don't want to answer it and then when
65:04 - you send out emails like this that come
65:06 - off desperate and needy people in high
65:08 - places don't want to answer it so no
65:10 - matter how good of a coder you are if
65:12 - you come off like that they're not even
65:15 - gonna read your email and that's what a
65:17 - lot of the time can make the difference
65:18 - between you making $30 an hour and 150
65:22 - dollars an hour okay so keep that in
65:27 - your in the back of your head now I'm
65:29 - gonna go ahead and answer you a question
65:31 - it took me three months going from zero
65:34 - to landing my first client with Python
65:37 - and then after two months of working for
65:40 - them or less than two months they gave
65:43 - me a nice little check for twenty
65:45 - thousand one hundred and seventy three
65:47 - dollars and thirty cents I got this when
65:50 - I was in my second year of college at
65:52 - Oakland Community College with a GPA of
65:55 - 2.0 so not your smartest student and
65:57 - Oakton doesn't necessarily sound like
65:59 - Harvard so hopefully that answers your
66:02 - question
66:08 - [Music]
66:12 - Viraj asks kazi while coding if any
66:15 - errors occur where can a beginner like
66:18 - me seek a help you can look on Stack
66:20 - Overflow but that sometimes complicated
66:23 - so to seek for help what I would do is
66:26 - if you have money hire a mentor on a
66:29 - platform like code mentor that's what I
66:33 - would do any money I made for my other
66:34 - job when I was trying to pick up my
66:36 - coding skills I would either hire a
66:37 - mentor and if I couldn't hire them
66:39 - I would go to meetup groups and I would
66:41 - try to learn everything that I could
