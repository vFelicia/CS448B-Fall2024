00:17 - we're going to talk about client-side
00:18 - rendering we're going to talk about
00:20 - static side generation dynamic side
00:22 - generation
00:23 - which one is better and when is each one
00:27 - better than the other
00:28 - okay so this is going to be super super

01:03 - right is we've had the privilege
01:04 - to work with over 5 000 students
01:08 - and help them go from not knowing that
01:10 - much coding
01:11 - to moving on and getting a job and our
01:13 - goal
01:14 - this year is to help 5 000 developers
01:17 - get jobs so for example my goal is that

01:54 - you know when you guys smash that like
01:56 - button and break that like button
01:58 - and it also means a lot when you get
02:00 - subscribed to the channel our family is
02:02 - the strongest this is a community
02:04 - and we're about to get that big 1
02:06 - million mark it's gonna be
02:08 - amazing and uh before we jump
02:11 - into the actual content of this training
02:13 - which we are about to do
02:15 - first thing i want to tell you is i've
02:18 - prepared an amazing training for you
02:20 - if you want to turn coding your passion
02:23 - into your career and you want to get a
02:26 - job as a full stack developer
02:28 - we have launched this training for you
02:30 - it's a one hour video
02:32 - and it talks about everything you need
02:34 - to know to become a full stack developer
02:35 - so for example
02:36 - it'll talk to you about how much
02:38 - javascript you actually need to know
02:40 - how much react that you actually need to
02:42 - know how much redux you'll need to know
02:45 - to become a developer
02:47 - how much firebase you'll need to know
02:49 - and of course we also cover and talk
02:51 - about mongodb which is a no
02:52 - sql database combine all of those
02:55 - together
02:56 - and you become a full stack master
02:59 - that's what that training is gonna cover
03:01 - so before we continue
03:02 - do me a favor click the link below and
03:05 - sign up for that training
03:07 - because it's just gonna be so freaking
03:09 - valuable and it's gonna be one of the
03:11 - best uses of your
03:13 - you know one hour okay with that said
03:16 - let's jump into the content for
03:18 - today so first up
03:21 - gatsby let's talk about gatsby js
03:25 - and what is this gatsby thing that you
03:28 - may
03:28 - or may not have heard of okay so let's
03:31 - continue
03:33 - now gatsby has about 49
03:36 - 000 stars on github which is absolutely
03:40 - crazy if you are if you go on github and
03:42 - you see right most
03:43 - repos will never have that much
03:45 - popularity but it's crazy how much
03:47 - popularity that it has
03:49 - and it's because it's freaking good all
03:51 - right that's what
03:52 - will tell you and it also tells you that
03:55 - it's popular
03:56 - and the community is actually actively
03:58 - supporting it okay other things i like
04:00 - to see
04:00 - when i want to take on a framework or
04:02 - take on a new library this is a pro hack
04:05 - i want to see also when was the last
04:07 - commit being made
04:09 - okay so when i see that the last commit
04:11 - here was being made
04:13 - four hours ago that's a really freaking
04:16 - good sign
04:16 - that means it's active people are
04:18 - updating this thing and changing it
04:20 - seven hours ago okay they're making
04:22 - changes thing
04:24 - to it all the time so now let's talk
04:26 - about the benefits of gatsby okay so for
04:29 - gatsby is a lot known for its static
04:32 - site generation
04:33 - and it's blazing fast so here's an
04:35 - example of a website that's built with
04:37 - gatsby it's called marvelapp.com
04:40 - you could actually go to it and check it
04:41 - out it's a pretty cool freaking site
04:43 - has a really cool design it's simple
04:46 - it's fast and marvel and this is what
04:49 - it's called right
04:50 - here's another example of a website
04:53 - built with gatsby
04:55 - hopefully a lot of you know about react
04:57 - okay so when you go to the actual
04:59 - official react.js.org website
05:02 - because some idiot bought react.js.com
05:04 - and is sitting on it
05:06 - but the this one react.js.org where they
05:09 - have the official documentation
05:11 - they actually built this with gatsby
05:13 - this is a perfect
05:15 - use case for when you should actually
05:18 - use
05:19 - gatsby and what i mean by that is this
05:21 - is static
05:22 - this is really not going to change much
05:25 - gatsby is also really really good for
05:27 - seo
05:28 - so it makes sense to me why they chose
05:30 - to go gatsby with this and it's just
05:31 - blazing fast
05:33 - okay here is another thing that's really
05:36 - helpful and powerful
05:38 - with gatsby if you're ever thinking of
05:39 - making a portfolio website
05:42 - where as a developer you're talking
05:44 - about your skills which you know
05:46 - blah blah blah portfolio sites are great
05:49 - to make with gatsby
05:51 - okay blazing fast and simple stuff
05:55 - is good with gatsby here's another
05:58 - example of something with gatsby and of
06:00 - course gatsby is also mobile
06:02 - responsive so you can build stuff
06:03 - whether you know when you want it on a
06:05 - tablet or you want it on an iphone
06:08 - or a full desktop website all of that is
06:11 - going to be really really good with
06:13 - gatsby so
06:14 - the connection i want to make is
06:15 - whenever you're thinking static
06:17 - things like blog where there's only like
06:20 - really one creator
06:21 - whenever you're thinking portfolios
06:23 - whenever you're thinking
06:24 - personal websites documentation i want
06:27 - you to think
06:28 - gatsby okay and how does gatsby
06:31 - kind of work under the hood let's go
06:34 - ahead and talk about it
06:36 - so we actually gatsby actually uses
06:39 - what's called
06:39 - client-side rendering okay and how
06:42 - client-side rendering works
06:43 - it's in this six-step process so number
06:46 - one
06:47 - as a user what you do is you go ahead as
06:49 - user and request
06:50 - a website so that's basically when you
06:52 - type in google.com
06:54 - or you type in marvel.com whatever
06:57 - website you want to go to right
06:59 - that's a user requesting server sends
07:02 - html file with javascript links so the
07:04 - server is going to send back the file
07:05 - and go
07:06 - hey here's the javascript file or here's
07:08 - the file and then you can use it so
07:10 - when you get the javascript file back
07:13 - now google is activated and you can
07:15 - actually use it and you can type in
07:16 - whatever you want and then it responds
07:18 - to you
07:20 - okay browser your browser like chrome
07:23 - or safari or whatever you're using right
07:27 - that's gonna download your html then
07:29 - browser also will download
07:31 - css and javascript okay so first it's
07:34 - going to download the html that's why
07:35 - html loads fast
07:37 - then css and javascript that's why if
07:39 - you don't optimize your images really
07:41 - well
07:42 - or your javascript code is not optimized
07:44 - properly your site is going to take a
07:46 - really long time to load
07:48 - this is why it's good to optimize your
07:49 - images and all of that number five
07:51 - browser executes framework or library
07:54 - so this is why if your code doesn't have
07:56 - too many libraries
07:58 - or too many frameworks you're using it's
08:00 - gonna be fast and it's gonna run much
08:02 - much much faster simply because there's
08:03 - less lines of code for your browser to
08:07 - execute
08:07 - and then number six the browser loads
08:10 - the website
08:10 - this is how client-signed rent
08:12 - client-side rendering
08:14 - works okay and that's usually what uh
08:17 - gatsby
08:18 - uses now let's go to the next one which
08:21 - is next js
08:22 - okay and you know if you guys can't hear
08:24 - from my voice
08:25 - it's a little bit of my personal
08:27 - favorite though i like both but i'll
08:29 - talk about when there's good times to
08:30 - use both of them
08:32 - this is how many stars this thing
08:34 - freaking has what the
08:36 - you know how hard it is to get stars
08:40 - every developer i know never gets any
08:42 - stars on their thing it was so hard for
08:44 - me to even get stars and we have
08:46 - almost a million subscribers on youtube
08:48 - getting stars is almost as hard as
08:51 - freaking getting a rating for a
08:52 - movie on imdb you know imdb those people
08:55 - are just like
08:56 - oh no this movie was not good for me and
08:59 - like pic like what the like why are
09:02 - you so
09:03 - picky that's how people are with this so
09:05 - when i see 65
09:06 - 000 stars i know this is banging
09:08 - and it's like
09:09 - hot right and the community is using it
09:11 - and there's community support behind it
09:12 - and again to commit 24 minutes ago so
09:15 - whoever's developing nexjs is literally
09:17 - sitting there in their underwear right
09:18 - this second
09:19 - coding all right that tells me there's
09:21 - good freaking support
09:23 - for this thing and it's backed by
09:25 - versailles okay
09:26 - um i love actually losing versa and
09:28 - deploying my sights with it
09:30 - so next js functionality out of the box
09:33 - kind of comes with versa so you know
09:35 - check them out and what i recommend is
09:37 - store them or wash them
09:39 - don't fork them but you know start them
09:41 - it's it's kind of cool
09:43 - all right so now here are types of
09:44 - websites you could build with next js so
09:46 - this is a perfect example
09:48 - of a website that you could use and it's
09:51 - not just an example
09:53 - marvel.com actually uses next.js
09:56 - okay they're using next.js and i think
09:59 - next.js
10:00 - is a better choice if you want to do
10:03 - stuff that's really dynamic
10:05 - okay so there might be a lot of things
10:06 - are changing to it they could have done
10:08 - this
10:09 - in gatsby but because there are a lot of
10:11 - users come
10:12 - logging in logging out maybe users can
10:14 - even create some type of content i'm not
10:16 - exactly sure
10:18 - but because there's so many users with
10:20 - that type of
10:21 - dynamism in your app it's better to go
10:24 - next.js on that okay so that's why i
10:26 - think that they're choosing to use that
10:29 - next up we have netflix okay and
10:32 - netflix and their jobs page they
10:35 - actually use
10:36 - next.js to power okay
10:39 - and again they need this content to be
10:41 - dynamic because they're always adding
10:43 - content taking it out
10:44 - there's tons and tons of users being
10:46 - created users can also create their own
10:48 - accounts
10:49 - users can share accounts between each
10:51 - other users can change their profile
10:53 - pictures i mean there's a lot of user
10:54 - stuff going on
10:55 - so whenever you think large applications
10:58 - with lots of users
11:00 - think next js here's another popular
11:03 - company
11:04 - that's using this goddamn thing have you
11:06 - ever heard of uber
11:08 - uber is using next so if uber is using
11:11 - next
11:12 - you should probably consider using next
11:15 - okay and a lot of
11:16 - developers right now who have that skill
11:19 - you are much hotter in the job market
11:21 - than some of the other losers
11:22 - that don't know next.js okay so add it
11:24 - to your arsenal add it to your
11:26 - repertoire love the comments that are
11:28 - coming in
11:29 - love the engagement we're at about 156
11:32 - people guys
11:33 - tell me something tell me something some
11:35 - comments tell me something that's going
11:37 - on
11:38 - i want to know okay recorded yes so
11:41 - people
11:41 - ask where they can see more information
11:43 - about the courses okay
11:46 - got it okay beautiful so guys if you
11:48 - have questions
11:50 - drop them below or if we have questions
11:53 - coming
11:53 - in at the end i'll also do a much longer
11:56 - q a with you guys okay and then we'll go
11:58 - much much much
11:59 - deeper on that let's keep rocking and
12:02 - rolling for right now
12:04 - here's another good example of a website
12:06 - that could use
12:07 - nexjs so if you were thinking about
12:09 - building a website like medium
12:11 - where you could make blog posts other
12:13 - users could sign
12:14 - up and make blog posts that's a really
12:17 - good time
12:18 - to use um next js
12:21 - okay that's gonna be the way to go for
12:23 - that because it's gonna be really really
12:25 - blazing fast
12:27 - and it's really good when it's really
12:30 - dynamic and there's tons of users
12:31 - creating content
12:36 - okay
12:40 - thank you so much for a five dollar
12:43 - donation
12:44 - that means a lot thank you thank you so
12:46 - much for your support
12:47 - really appreciate it is it
12:51 - with gas possible um
12:54 - cra so create react app that's what that
12:58 - is
12:58 - so gatsby so here's the thing and i
13:01 - wanted to talk about this a little bit
13:02 - later as well
13:03 - there's a lot of like create react app
13:05 - functionality
13:07 - that you can have with gatsby even
13:09 - though they're going to be slightly
13:10 - different
13:11 - they're very very similar and there's a
13:13 - lot that you can do with gatsby plugins
13:16 - okay and you can do a lot of
13:17 - customization with gatsby plugins as
13:19 - well so that's a great question thank
13:21 - you for that question
13:23 - asks can beginners start with next js
13:26 - so asks can beginners start
13:29 - with next js i think yes
13:32 - as a beginner you could start with nexjs
13:35 - my personal recommendation to you would
13:37 - be
13:37 - learn react first and then
13:41 - learn next js okay as like the second
13:44 - step it's a little bit more advanced
13:47 - if you just wanted to jump in head first
13:49 - you could but you're going to kind of be
13:50 - really really confused okay
13:52 - so i would recommend start with react
13:54 - first can i use an xjs with react
13:57 - can i use nexjs with react that's a
13:58 - great question so again a lot of the
14:01 - react functionality
14:02 - yes like next js will have that okay
14:05 - so i'll be able to do a lot of react
14:08 - stuff inside of next.js so yeah
14:11 - you could okay here's another website
14:14 - that you and i know about
14:16 - material ui which is actually built with
14:19 - next okay that's what they use so that's
14:22 - why it's fast and it's pretty freaking
14:24 - awesome
14:24 - okay and server-side rendering right
14:27 - this is how server-side rendering
14:29 - essentially works
14:30 - so number one server sending ready
14:34 - to be rendered html okay and then this
14:36 - is your responsive browser so in the
14:38 - start
14:39 - it's kind of waiting for the response
14:41 - right then we have
14:43 - browser renders the page okay so the
14:45 - page at this step
14:47 - is already viewable in client-side
14:50 - the thing is not viewable until
14:52 - everything is done in server-side
14:54 - rendering
14:55 - hey even before the page is actually
14:58 - interactive
14:59 - it's viewable already which is really
15:01 - freaking cool because that's what you
15:03 - want otherwise
15:04 - it's going to take a really long time
15:06 - for all of the javascript to load
15:08 - so this is the part that i really really
15:10 - like about server sign rendering
15:12 - okay now the third step browser executes
15:15 - your react
15:16 - code okay and then step four the page is
15:19 - now
15:20 - actually interactable so you can
15:22 - actually interact with the page click it
15:24 - watch the video click on the blog post
15:27 - thumbs up a post thumbs it down that
15:30 - interaction is now available but the
15:32 - viewing is happening before the
15:34 - interaction is
15:34 - even available which is why the what the
15:38 - first
15:38 - touch the meaningful first touch print
15:41 - that is really really really fast with
15:44 - server-side rendered stuff you know like
15:46 - next js's
15:48 - okay and um
15:51 - we should have had this slide actually
15:53 - for the gatsby part not next yes part
15:56 - but that's all good
15:58 - gatsby a lot of it actually uses graphql
16:01 - out of the box it uses graphql for its
16:03 - image transformations and optimizations
16:06 - it also uses graphql for it's like the
16:08 - way that it uses its apis and their rest
16:11 - apis
16:12 - so that actually i really really like i
16:15 - really love how graphql
16:17 - works it's much much much better and
16:19 - less headachy
16:20 - than your average regular rest apis
16:24 - less redundant so i really like that
16:26 - functionality that it brings out of the
16:28 - box
16:28 - okay and now let's go to some key points
16:31 - between the two
16:32 - okay and we can probably share the
16:35 - screen now
16:36 - kyle so here are some key points i want
16:38 - you to remember
16:39 - from this okay so both are really really
16:43 - high performing
16:44 - okay and uh both are actually react js
16:48 - based frameworks javascript frameworks
16:51 - okay so both are
16:53 - javascript frameworks that are react
16:55 - based
16:56 - now both also have server-side rendering
16:59 - and client-side rendering capabilities
17:01 - but next.js
17:02 - is more on the server-side rendering
17:03 - okay that's actually that's what uh
17:05 - next.js really primarily is and then
17:08 - gatsby
17:09 - is more along the lines of client-side
17:11 - rendering
17:13 - and then let's talk about code splitting
17:15 - and caching so both of them have
17:17 - an amazing ability to code split and
17:19 - cache
17:20 - though next j has has some next level
17:22 - code splitting abilities okay even when
17:24 - you go to their main website you can see
17:25 - that and what that essentially means
17:27 - is if i have tons of code on my website
17:31 - right
17:32 - like let's take netflix for example when
17:35 - you go
17:36 - to like one movie it just shows us the
17:38 - code and uses that code that plays that
17:41 - movie
17:41 - it doesn't actually like load the code
17:44 - for every single movie that's
17:46 - on that page okay so at a very basic
17:49 - level
17:50 - what code splitting essentially means is
17:53 - we
17:53 - take we don't use the stuff that we
17:56 - don't need at that point
17:58 - okay and normally it's a really
18:00 - complicated process to add code
18:01 - splitting to your app
18:03 - and make your app really lightweight but
18:06 - with next.js
18:07 - a lot of it if you use it intelligently
18:09 - kind of comes out of the box
18:11 - so your app is blazingly fast and
18:14 - really really light then let's talk
18:18 - about react router versus next.js
18:20 - router right so for example um when you
18:23 - have
18:24 - gas b gatsby uses built like the react
18:26 - router
18:27 - that's how it does its routing next js
18:30 - actually use
18:30 - its own proprietary next.js router both
18:34 - are pretty cool
18:35 - but with gatsby if you already have tons
18:37 - of experience with react and react
18:38 - router it's going to be kind of a little
18:39 - bit easier to pick up
18:40 - though even the next gs router is pretty
18:43 - straightforward to pick up
18:46 - static side generation versus dynamic
18:48 - sight generation
18:50 - you know a gatsby i think more on the
18:52 - side of static side generation nexus
18:54 - more on the side of dynamic side
18:55 - generation and then lastly in order to
18:58 - fetch
18:59 - data and display it the way that you do
19:01 - that with these types of frameworks is
19:03 - actually
19:04 - you can get the rest apis using a cms
19:07 - backend okay so content management
19:09 - system you can use like
19:10 - wordpress contentful or prismic
19:13 - okay i've actually i have experience
19:15 - with contentful wordpress
19:16 - and a little bit with prismic as well so
19:18 - those are really good
19:20 - content management systems you can use
19:22 - so maybe you can like for example host
19:24 - your blog post there
19:25 - host your images there and they give you
19:27 - really nice admin to point and click
19:29 - tools
19:30 - right so it's a head you can also use
19:32 - headless cmss if you want
19:34 - and then you can pull all that content
19:36 - out of there using for gatsby you can
19:38 - use graphql to pull that content out and
19:40 - put on your website
19:42 - and for um for
19:45 - for an xjs you can use the rest api and
19:48 - whichever
19:49 - one you want right if you want graphql
19:51 - with next you can use graphql if you
19:52 - want to just use regular rest apis
19:55 - you can do that as well okay so great
19:58 - and now i want to touch on a couple of
20:00 - differences between
20:02 - the two and by the way are you guys
20:03 - enjoying this so far
20:06 - just ask that question that you answered
20:08 - uses graphics and
20:10 - graphql can use a rest api
20:13 - yeah so it forces you to use graphql cat
20:17 - speech so you actually cannot use
20:20 - uh rest api with that it's gonna be
20:23 - harder
20:24 - out of the box it forces you to use it
20:26 - that's why i'm gonna talk about this
20:28 - pretty soon actually let's just talk
20:30 - about it right now go to the next thing
20:32 - so see gatsby uses graphql out of the
20:34 - box it's opinionated it like
20:36 - wants you to go a specific way okay
20:39 - whereas next.js goes hey you decide
20:42 - but i'll also tell you this things are a
20:43 - little bit more difficult out of the box
20:45 - with next.js okay
20:46 - because when i was playing around with
20:48 - the two i noticed that by the way if you
20:50 - guys are enjoying this so far
20:52 - do me a favor smash that like button
20:56 - break that like button that's it okay
21:00 - and we're about to drop our banger uh
21:03 - disney plus clone tomorrow which is
21:04 - gonna be
21:05 -  sick make sure you guys show up
21:07 - for that okay that's gonna be absolutely
21:09 - brilliant
21:10 - so gatsby let's talk about how it handle
21:14 - uh images right so gatsby handles image
21:17 - transformations
21:18 - out of the box it's really cool how it
21:21 - does that it uses graphql under the hood
21:24 - to make those optimizations happen you
21:26 - kind of don't have to do anything
21:28 - next js you have to figure out how
21:30 - you're going to optimize the images
21:32 - that is requires much more manual work
21:35 - okay so there's a lot of like
21:36 - more manual work that you have to do
21:37 - with next.js but if you're really
21:39 - looking to build a large scale
21:41 - application
21:42 - then you want to go the next js route
21:46 - got a question from abner i own a
21:48 - roofing company how hard would it be and
21:50 - how much would it cost to build a site
21:52 - and app for both customers and internal
21:54 - use five dollar donation by the way
21:57 - wow abner gives another five dollar
21:59 - donation so thank you so much for that
22:01 - really really appreciate it and the
22:02 - question is
22:04 - um he wants to build an app how hard
22:07 - would it be how about an app
22:08 - and how much would it cost to build a
22:10 - site for customers got it
22:12 - and internal use okay so how hard would
22:14 - it be to build an
22:15 - app uh especially for uh customer use
22:19 - and internal use for a roofing company
22:22 - so apps
22:23 - generally are very expensive okay and
22:26 - they're gonna take a lot of time to
22:28 - build it
22:28 - if you can get a good developer
22:31 - potentially like as a ceo what i would
22:33 - say is like go to third world countries
22:36 - first and get a prototype up and running
22:40 - before bringing it to the states and
22:43 - then going from there okay that way you
22:45 - can get a prototype
22:46 - running of what you're looking for for
22:49 - like
22:50 - one hundredth of the price or 150th of
22:54 - the price
22:55 - and then if you want long-term
22:56 - developers that also have really good
22:58 - communication skills and you want to
23:00 - then you probably want to bring it here
23:02 - so
23:03 - i would say honestly a couple of
23:05 - thousand dollars
23:06 - and two weeks one to two weeks hiring
23:09 - developers
23:10 - should do the trick and you should get
23:12 - your first
23:14 - basic basic prototype up and running
23:17 - okay but just keep in mind app
23:19 - development is an expensive
23:21 - thing all right and if you're gonna go
23:23 - take it to the next level yes
23:25 - be ready to have like a bigger budget
23:27 - between like 20 to 40
23:28 - 000 to do it and one more question how
23:31 - do you stay motivated while doing
23:33 - projects
23:34 - so how do you stay motivated while doing
23:36 - projects and i'm assuming they're
23:38 - talking about coding projects
23:39 - yes okay what i recommend is do things
23:42 - that are
23:43 - fun and meaningful to you and exciting
23:45 - to you so for example if you're a rapper
23:47 - or you're a musician
23:48 - make a app that is made for musicians
23:51 - that makes your life
23:52 - easier or more fun or more entertaining
23:55 - do something that's much more meaningful
23:57 - to you if you are a chess player like
24:00 - myself
24:01 - make a chess game
24:04 - right if you are good at skateboarding
24:06 - and you enjoy
24:07 - skateboarding make something that has to
24:10 - do with skateboarding make a website
24:12 - that highlights all the best skaters
24:15 - you can sort it by the best skaters and
24:17 - the worst skaters and
24:18 - it's like start showing them at the
24:20 - front there's like filters
24:21 - it has search functionality and you can
24:23 - like type in
24:24 - names of different skaters and it'll
24:26 - bring them up
24:28 - so do something that's personally
24:31 - meaningful to you that's what's gonna
24:32 - keep you going and it's gonna be just so
24:34 - much fun
24:35 - instead of like feeling like you're
24:36 - pulling teeth
24:38 - okay so that's what i would recommend
24:42 - now let's go to the next part which is
24:44 - you know
24:45 - next js and next year that's what i like
24:48 - about it is it offers
24:50 - both dynamic and static routing and
24:52 - dynamic and static site generation
24:55 - so like and now next.js is getting
24:59 - really good at static sites too so like
25:01 - portfolio sites and things like that
25:03 - so in my mind uh n how i think about
25:06 - next gestures is basically has
25:08 - everything
25:09 - gatsby has and then some
25:12 - but at the payoff
25:16 - and kind of like the negative part of
25:17 - doing a lot of stuff manually so if
25:19 - you're doing stuff and you're building
25:21 - something
25:22 - by yourself it's a small scale project
25:24 - you're doing it alone you want to do
25:26 - something quick and easy
25:27 - go gatsby
25:30 - if on the other hand you're doing
25:32 - something
25:33 - that you know you want potential
25:36 - new people to see and you want to apply
25:38 - to netflix
25:39 - and you want to apply to marvel
25:42 - probably build a personal site or a
25:46 - multi-user site
25:47 - with next.js and then have
25:51 - that on your portfolio and say hey i
25:52 - know how to use nexjs
25:54 - that's going to make you really stand
25:55 - out it's something really popular that
25:57 - people are doing
25:58 - okay so i would highly recommend you
26:00 - actually at least
26:01 - learn both and spend some time with next
26:05 - js okay
26:06 - so that's how i would put it um if
26:09 - you're okay with the manual work
26:10 - then next yes okay so that's how i put
26:12 - it ease of use
26:14 - gatsby bigger more complicated sites
26:18 - next js makes sense
26:22 - cool one last thing i want to end this
26:24 - uh
26:25 - off with and i want to go straight into
26:26 - q a and take your questions and answer
26:28 - them
26:29 - is of course make sure that you sign up
26:33 - for that training that we have for you
26:36 - let's bring that up please that training
26:38 - is going to show you
26:39 - everything you need to become a full
26:41 - stack developer so i'm going to dive
26:42 - deep into the exact amount of javascript
26:45 - you need to become a developer
26:47 - exactly how much react you need to know
26:50 - to become a develop full stack developer
26:53 - we're going to go into redux and what
26:55 - redux
26:56 - is in this hot term of state management
26:58 - and what that actually really means
26:59 - we're going to go into real-time
27:01 - databases like firebase
27:03 - okay and we're going to talk about no
27:06 - sql databases like mongodb
27:08 - which are super popular and important
27:10 - for you to learn
27:12 - in 2021 and going beyond
27:15 - if you want to learn this and you want
27:17 - to master all of this
27:19 - what i need you to do right now is go
27:21 - click the link below
27:23 - and sign up for the free training it's
27:25 - absolutely free
27:27 - it's an hour long of just massive value
27:30 - for you
27:31 - okay and yeah go ahead and sign up for
27:34 - that and if you're signed up for that in
27:35 - the comments below let me know
27:37 - done you know or just say thanos if
27:40 - you've signed up for it just
27:41 - say thanos okay that would be amazing
27:46 - with that said i hope that you guys
27:48 - really really enjoyed today's show
27:50 - and what i want to do is essentially
27:52 - answer some questions for you if you
27:54 - have any
27:55 - and maybe even take a you know uh take a
27:58 - call or two from you guys
28:00 - okay so let's get into that we can pull
28:02 - out of the slides now kyle i think
28:04 - that's all good
28:05 - subo asks why use react when you have
28:07 - view
28:09 - um and kyle now these comments on the
28:11 - left hand side you can actually show
28:13 - them
28:14 - so if whatever comment that he's talking
28:16 - oh perfect i can see them too
28:18 - so whatever comment frankie just talked
28:20 - about see if you could find it
28:22 - and maybe pop that up why use react
28:26 - when you have viewed um
28:29 - frankie is it a recent comment
28:34 - okay so see if you could see if you
28:37 - could find it
28:38 - but why use react click add to broadcast
28:42 - perfect perfect there we go it's right
28:46 - there
28:46 - so why use react when you have view
28:49 - i just like react better easier
28:53 - more understandable view is also good if
28:56 - you want to use view you can but react
28:58 - has more jobs
28:59 - react is more popular i personally also
29:02 - like it much more so that's it
29:06 - and then x out of that question kyle
29:08 - please next question
29:10 - gatsby is server side rendering right
29:13 - okay so let's see if we can find that
29:16 - and help him find those questions too by
29:18 - the way
29:21 - right there jarwish cool so is gatsby
29:24 - server server-side rendering
29:26 - right gatsby is uh not server-side
29:29 - rendering gatsby is client-side
29:31 - rendering
29:32 - okay so jarvis i hope that answers your
29:34 - question
29:35 - okay thank you for being on here murtaza
29:40 - just signed up for the training he just
29:41 - said thanos let's
29:43 - go bertha that's what i'm talking about
29:45 - brilliant
29:47 - how about seo um gatsby and seo
29:51 - thanksgiving seo okay so let's bring
29:54 - cashfield's question how is gatsby good
29:57 - for
29:58 - cool so how is gatsby good for seo so
30:01 - gatsby has a lot of built-in things that
30:03 - are optimized for seo
30:05 - okay so the site mapping that it comes
30:07 - with is really really good
30:09 - your website will start to rank really
30:11 - really well because the
30:13 - uh cache that it stores is really
30:16 - helpful for when the
30:17 - bots come to scrape your site right when
30:20 - the bots basically ask hey what this
30:22 - site is about
30:23 - or what's on this site gatsby can
30:25 - quickly
30:26 - uh statically generate the site it's
30:28 - already there and it basically lets them
30:30 - know
30:31 - right whereas server side rendering when
30:34 - the bots come to look at the site it's
30:36 - not there already
30:37 - it is rendered later so the bots just
30:40 - leave they're like there's no site here
30:42 - and they just
30:43 - leave so that seo for them is not good
30:46 - but when they come to a statically
30:48 - generated site like gatsby they go
30:50 - hey the site is there we see it we can
30:53 - read all the content that's on there
30:55 - and so that's why it ends up being
30:58 - really good for seo out of the box
31:00 - with that said mr cashfield what i will
31:04 - say
31:05 - is next.js if you'll get good with it
31:08 - you can also do
31:09 - equally good seo
31:12 - uh what's the main difference between
31:14 - server and client-side rendering
31:16 - so developer then asks what's the main
31:18 - difference between server
31:20 - and client-side rendering okay so the
31:23 - biggest difference really is
31:25 - how the rendering actually takes place
31:28 - okay the fact that server-side rendering
31:30 - ends up taking place
31:32 - like you can actually interact with the
31:34 - page beforehand
31:35 - it's loaded whereas static site um
31:38 - whereas client-side rendering it waits
31:41 - for the whole
31:42 - thing to load both are really good but
31:45 - what i will say is if you're using
31:47 - big apps that have multi-users go with
31:50 - server-side rendering where users are
31:54 - creating tons of content
31:56 - if you're using portfolios type of stuff
31:58 - do client-side rendering
32:01 - okay uh bearaket signed up for the
32:04 - training absolutely amazing thank you so
32:07 - much for signing up for the training
32:08 - that makes me really happy
32:09 - yusuf asks how much js is needed to
32:12 - start learning
32:13 - frameworks
32:18 - yes you'll do it okay how much
32:20 - javascript is needed to start learning
32:23 - frameworks get decently good with it so
32:26 - what i mean by that is have some
32:28 - experience with
32:29 - programming right have some skills with
32:32 - programming
32:34 - problem solving skills with javascript
32:35 - and then go and like
32:37 - learn okay and uh kyle actually you know
32:40 - what you should do open up visual studio
32:42 - code so just do visual
32:43 - and then stop typing please hit enter
32:47 - perfect go to one of the ones that have
32:49 - more code on it so like open up the on
32:51 - the left yeah open
32:52 - yeah just open up app.js maybe or index
32:55 - go game slice
32:57 - go to the third one game slice third tab
33:00 - third tap game slice perfect see if you
33:03 - can throw that behind me
33:05 - so grab it and just move it to the right
33:10 - perfect and now do me a favor and let go
33:12 - and do hold command
33:14 - option f nice
33:18 - okay cool that looks great um
33:21 - so you can remove that question now but
33:24 - yusuf
33:25 - yeah you don't really need to know too
33:27 - much but just know have like
33:29 - beginner to intermediate understanding
33:31 - if i give you a problem like write a for
33:33 - loop write a if then statement
33:35 - those things you should be able to do
33:36 - before you start learning frameworks
33:38 - because there's no point to learn
33:39 - frameworks if you suck at coding
33:41 - okay
33:46 - sync asks which image optimization
33:48 - solution is better
33:49 - it's right there the
33:54 - so which image optimization solution is
33:57 - better gatsby image plug-in or nextgs
33:59 - image component
34:01 - both are really really good but what i
34:03 - personally found
34:04 - uh a cease is gatsby was much easier
34:08 - to figure out the image optimization
34:10 - because it just came out of the box
34:12 - okay whereas for next.js it took much
34:14 - more time
34:15 - but both are really really good for
34:17 - optimization okay
34:19 - so depending on whichever framework
34:21 - you're using they're both going to be
34:22 - equally good
34:23 - so great question these are really good
34:25 - questions
34:27 - uh let me see there's a better version
34:31 - so sure let's pop that one up and hassam
34:34 - asks which
34:35 - one of the following redux context
34:39 - this tent is better for handling state
34:43 - in a next
34:44 - project in general and also in terms of
34:46 - ease of use
34:47 - and efficiency that's actually a really
34:50 - really good question
34:52 - i i know that you can still use
34:56 - redux with next i've seen people do that
34:59 - but i know that it's much harder to use
35:02 - next or context or i'm sorry
35:05 - redux or context with next.js with
35:08 - server-side rendering
35:09 - i do know that any type of state
35:12 - management is actually
35:13 - much much much more complex okay i've
35:17 - never looked into zystend
35:18 - but for sure i know you can use redux
35:20 - with next.js and it's going to be really
35:22 - good
35:23 - i don't know if you can use context with
35:26 - next
35:26 - or not okay so if somebody could look
35:29 - that up for
35:30 - me and please drop it in the chat that
35:31 - would be really helpful
35:34 - thank you great question
35:37 - that i'm about to share so we're also
35:39 - dropping um
35:40 - i'm also dropping my phone number so you
35:42 - guys are able to actually message me
35:44 - directly
35:45 - okay we're gonna drop that in the chat
35:47 - and as a matter of fact
35:48 - kyle is actually gonna pop that up on
35:50 - the screen right now
35:51 - hit the i icon next to it perfect
35:55 - so go ahead right here guys and shoot me
35:57 - a text
35:58 - right now okay and i'll personally
36:00 - answer your questions
36:02 - help out if we have a new video coming
36:04 - i'll let you know
36:05 - okay this is my personal phone okay and
36:08 - let's me message you
36:10 - and then if there's any motivational
36:12 - tips or like don't stop coding type of
36:14 - stuff i will also share that with you
36:16 - okay and i hope it's going to be helpful
36:18 - so give me that text below i'd love to
36:20 - chat with you
36:24 - yeah mirko says uh pop up mirko's
36:26 - comment he says
36:27 - redux is even harder than vanilla js and
36:30 - css combined haha
36:32 - yes uh yeah redux starts getting very
36:35 - very
36:36 - difficult very very quickly okay but
36:38 - with the redux toolkit that they
36:40 - launched recently
36:42 - that helps make it a little bit easier
36:44 - to use because redux is completely
36:46 - immutable
36:47 - and they're using an internal library
36:49 - called immer that alone made things so
36:52 - much more difficult to do things
36:54 - and change things but with redux toolkit
36:56 - it kind of
36:57 - adds an abstraction layer on top of
37:00 - everything else
37:01 - and makes it easier so you could write
37:03 - mutable looking code and do things in a
37:05 - much easier way okay so now with redux
37:07 - toolkit
37:08 - redux is much easier to use so look into
37:10 - redux toolkit
37:12 - uh mr cashfield's common let's pop that
37:14 - up
37:16 - going from javascript experience i'm
37:19 - guessing i'd need node.js experience on
37:22 - top of react
37:23 - for what
37:27 - for needed for what
37:31 - okay that's the question i'll ask you um
37:36 - for like for you to use next js
37:40 - sure for gatsby oh for gatsby got it
37:43 - okay so for gatsby um
37:46 - no you don't really need node experience
37:49 - yeah you don't really need node
37:50 - experience to use it and you
37:52 - need just a little bit of react
37:54 - experience and you should be good
37:57 - you definitely need react react
37:58 - experience but you don't need that much
38:00 - node experience to use gatsby
38:02 - okay dope
38:05 - uh i have projects and i want to start
38:07 - freelancing

38:21 - tips for you
38:22 - are get really good at coding and build
38:25 - those projects and put them on your
38:26 - portfolio

38:56 - get the skills skills to pay the
38:58 - bills
38:59 - that's what's gonna help you not money
39:01 - in the start okay because you probably
39:03 - suck in the start
39:04 - that's just the reality of it it sucks

39:28 - put them on your website get the
39:30 - five-star reviews put them on your
39:32 - profile like upwork fiverr or whatever
39:35 - and then six months later or a year

39:39 - but get the skills first
39:40 - because the money will always follow the
39:42 - skill and value that you can provide to
39:43 - the market
39:44 - that's my advice to you
39:49 - saludos de colombia what's up andres
39:52 - how's it going brother
39:54 - welcome welcome to the stream
39:57 - rahman says i sent message to your phone
40:00 - amazing hilla says this got real
40:03 - yeah it got real okay
40:05 - i'm not worried about getting real with
40:07 - you guys i love you guys okay
40:10 - uh what should we use
40:13 - chopra fox says what do you think about
40:16 - jetpack compost
40:18 - no idea what that is that's why i've
40:19 - been avoiding that question
40:21 - but thank you for that question i don't
40:23 - actually know what jetpack
40:25 - great question tanjil what should we use
40:27 - mongodb or firebase
40:28 - both are really good i personally like
40:31 - firebase a lot more
40:33 - why kazi why one i think it's easier
40:37 - two it gives me a real-time database so
40:39 - things happen lightning fast
40:41 - three i can deploy using firebase as
40:44 - well
40:44 - i can host my website okay four
40:48 - i can get google authentication or
40:50 - whatever i want very very very easily in
40:53 - my app
40:54 - so for me it's firebase but learn
40:57 - both because big companies massive
40:59 - companies also use mongodb and they're
41:02 - probably more
41:03 - successful companies that are using
41:04 - mongodb than even firebase
41:06 - okay so whatever i said add some grain
41:10 - of salt to it
41:11 - swirl it and take it with that 175
41:14 - people live
41:15 -  yeah 175 people live that's what
41:19 - i'm talking about our stream is way
41:20 - better than those guys
41:22 - is it good to use react with django and
41:24 - how much reaction i know to use
41:27 - let's pop that question up and frankie
41:30 - whenever you get that
41:31 - also say what their image looks like
41:33 - that they'll help
41:35 - kyle find that jefferson black and white
41:39 - abdullah said does it does it would be
41:42 - good does it would be good does it does
41:45 - it would be
41:46 - good if i use react with django okay
41:50 - so um the answer to that is
41:53 - yes it does would be good if you use
41:56 - react with django i think they're very
41:58 - very powerful and if you learn react
42:02 - you can combine it with django how you
42:04 - do that
42:05 - is you coat the front end with react
42:08 - back end with python
42:09 - or django okay whip up an api
42:15 - and you're good to go okay so yes you
42:17 - can combine them both
42:19 - make a killer combo ozone says what
42:22 - about sequel light
42:23 - 3 with no js absolutely
42:27 - why not use it by all means i think
42:29 - that's a great idea
42:32 - okay been working david cho let's look
42:35 - at david cho
42:36 - orange d been working with next for the
42:40 - past month

43:08 - that would be awesome so
43:11 - cool and he goes been working with next
43:13 - for the past month next image is really
43:15 - hard to work with where
43:16 - as gatsby's just works
43:19 - yes same here exact experience i had
43:23 - okay gatsby's was so much easier it's
43:25 - like why wouldn't you make something as
43:27 - simple as an
43:28 - image easy to do why do i have to do
43:30 - rocket science for my images to look
43:32 - good and show up i don't understand
43:35 - okay certain things are just weird let's
43:38 - keep going
43:40 - okay great questions you guys are asking
43:42 - uh
43:43 - gate great questions venom raiders ask
43:46 - django versus node.js
43:48 - jango versus node.js um
43:53 - uh hit uh delete so kyle make sure the
43:55 - question goes away
43:57 - i mean both are good it just depends
43:59 - what you're doing right if you're doing
44:00 - javascript go node
44:02 - if you're going python go django that's
44:04 - my answer to that one
44:05 - text me below let's go
44:09 - okay text me uh gatsby
44:12 - or text me next whichever one is your
44:16 - framework of choice i'm curious
44:20 - web storm ids peter
44:23 - jean share asks what do you think about
44:25 - the webstorm ide
44:27 - honestly all the jetbrain ides are my
44:31 - personal favorite okay at least they
44:34 - used to be
44:36 - now i am in love with visual studio code
44:39 - ide
44:40 - though i still and here's why
44:43 - visual studio code ides are like uh
44:46 - they're like crack you get addicted to
44:49 - it i haven't done crack
44:50 - but they're like very lightweight and
44:54 - you kind of get
44:55 - addicted to it and you just use it i
44:57 - loved
44:58 - my jet brain ides that when i would use
45:00 - them for python and django because they
45:02 - were much more intelligent than visual
45:04 - studio code like visual studio code is
45:05 - like really stupid
45:07 - i'll like have a variable written and
45:09 - i'll be like writing it in the same file
45:11 - and it won't auto-complete it properly
45:13 - or it'll auto-complete something stupid
45:15 - um i'll be typing something i forget
45:19 - like i'll be writing like html i'll hit
45:21 - tab
45:22 - and it'll like auto complete something
45:24 - completely different than what i had
45:25 - wanted and i'm like
45:26 - why are you doing that that never
45:28 - happened with me in jetbrains
45:30 - ever and jetbrains was always so
45:33 - smart it knew how my entire project
45:36 - worked
45:36 - so like it would give me these autistic
45:38 - completions
45:39 - that were genius like from other files
45:42 - another or whatever
45:44 - it will know all the pads to all the
45:46 - files perfectly without me needing to
45:48 - add any new plugins
45:49 - and if i wrote code that could cause
45:52 - problems
45:53 - between even any of the other project
45:55 - files even if i was working on like a
45:57 - mega project
45:58 - it knew and it told me ahead of time
46:01 - it blew my mind it always blew my mind
46:03 - it was freaking amazing whereas visual
46:05 - studio code
46:06 - it seems like it kind of only knows
46:08 - about that like one file
46:10 - and even that it doesn't really know it
46:12 - that well
46:14 - so if i wasn't lazy and i would
46:18 - you know i would probably use webstorm
46:20 - and i would use the jetbrains ide
46:22 - but because i just like how quickly vs
46:25 - code opens i
46:26 - end up using vs code okay so
46:29 - that's my answer
46:34 - great let's keep going now did peter
46:36 - respond let's keep going
46:38 - oh lots of wait what's going on lots of
46:40 - questions go up are there any other good
46:42 - questions of this course
46:43 - okay keep going now debbie davey race
46:46 - asks
46:46 - how about authentication what's better
46:48 - to implement uh
46:50 - authentication i like firebase because
46:52 - it allows me to add
46:53 - google really really quickly done great
46:56 - question
46:58 - hit x on the kyle please node which is
47:01 - the best for back end we already
47:02 - addressed that one keep going
47:08 - okay node.js versus next.js there are
47:10 - two different things guys
47:14 - um i mean i don't really know much about
47:17 - larvae
47:19 - yeah so depot says i love intellij as
47:22 - well yeah let's keep going now
47:26 - okay any recommendation yeah so any
47:30 - recommendations for
47:31 - extensions on vs code yes bracket pair
47:33 - colorizer
47:34 - i definitely need it for javascript it
47:37 - drives me crazy
47:38 - with its squigglies and squigglies and
47:41 - parentheses and i need bracket pair
47:44 - colorizer okay so that's uh one of the
47:47 - extensions that's very helpful for me
47:50 - and then i think the other ones are
47:53 - prettier
47:54 - prettier is really good prettier is
47:57 - really good yes
47:58 - live server that allows me to like show
48:01 - my app
48:01 - and like kind of without refreshing i
48:03 - can see it running on my local host
48:07 - um vim is my
48:10 - personal favorite okay vim i use all the
48:13 - freaking time and they
48:14 - crushed it with their vim brilliant
48:17 - so that's i love that and then
48:20 - probably some other ones but like i
48:22 - don't really use them that much probably
48:25 - is php dead pa is php dead no php is
48:30 - still pretty popular
48:31 - but i mean i just like react and stuff
48:33 - more i'm coming from gantry to next and
48:35 - i'm having difficulty with next just
48:37 - haven't just really set the width in
48:38 - advance yeah
48:39 - hassam again this is awesome
48:43 - so pull that comment up just a little
48:44 - bit kyle on the left hand on the left
48:46 - hand side on ecamp
48:48 - so pull that comment just a little bit
48:49 - because otherwise the phone number was
48:50 - blocking you see pull it down a little
48:52 - bit now it's too much
48:53 - thank you perfect okay great um
48:56 - so i'm coming from gatsby to next js and
48:59 - i'm having difficulties with next image
49:01 - component especially having to
49:02 - explicitly set the width and height in
49:04 - advance
49:04 - when you have images of different aspect
49:06 - ratios
49:08 - absolutely this is the thing that we
49:09 - were talking about about next js where
49:12 - image optimization is a lot harder
49:14 - whereas with gatsby
49:16 - it kind of comes out of the box so i
49:17 - feel your pain and that's the pain that
49:19 - we all are feeling in the
49:21 - uh you know in the community and in the
49:24 - chat okay so thanks for sharing that
49:26 - let's hit x on that
49:31 - okay
49:35 - okay okay let's go
49:39 - mr cashfield
49:42 - amazing mr cashfield goes i needed this
49:46 - live stream after finishing my
49:47 - javascript course which javascript
49:49 - course did you finish by the way
49:50 - and he goes gatsby pro by the end of the
49:53 - year
49:54 - let's go mr cashfield that's amazing and

50:24 - kyle that i think is
50:26 - awesome
50:31 - yeah peter liked that answer i knew it
50:33 - peter says your answer
50:35 - about web storm id was very useful
50:39 - thank you absolutely you got it brother
50:41 - and now hit x on it please
50:48 - is it okay to learn react before
50:50 - javascript so what i recommend
50:52 - with that is learn javascript first
50:54 - learn it well
50:55 - then come to react is it possible to
50:58 - learn
50:58 - just react first absolutely but you were
51:01 - going to get stuck and it's going to be
51:02 - bad when you get stuck
51:04 - so learn javascript first asks what cms
51:07 - would you recommend
51:08 - to be used with next js
51:11 - the green a
51:15 - is it it's closer to the bottom it's
51:16 - closer to the bottom so let's keep going
51:19 - oh wow tons of comments coming in thank
51:21 - you guys asis asks what cms would you
51:24 - recommend to be used with nexjs
51:26 - i mean pick your poison okay so
51:31 - you want to use contentful go for it if
51:33 - you want to use oh my lord um
51:36 - yeah you can you can use um honestly any
51:39 - headless cms
51:40 - any head full cms you want just pick one
51:44 - like contentful is good prismic is good
51:47 - i think i ended up going with prismic
51:50 - i'm not
51:51 - exactly sure there's sanity i o as well
51:53 - so you could use sanity io
51:55 - sanity io looked really clean and what's
51:57 - cool about san diego is on traversing
51:59 - media's youtube channel
52:00 - there's this girl that dropped the
52:02 - youtube video
52:05 - covering sanity i o crash course so you
52:07 - can watch the sanity i o
52:09 - and then implement the sanity io cms
52:12 - with your next js app i think that would
52:14 - be cool
52:16 - okay nice job
52:20 - kyle sonya says man you're the best
52:23 - thank you bro appreciate it let's keep
52:24 - going now
52:26 - erica asks steps to learning quickly and
52:28 - perfect

52:33 - advice would you give to a new upcoming
52:34 - javascript that's a good one

52:38 - thomas peter
52:39 - that's right yep so what advice
52:43 - will you give a new upcoming javascript
52:46 - developer like what should he
52:48 - she do to become competent and capable

53:04 - up-and-coming javascript developer
53:06 - here's what i'll tell you please for the
53:09 - love of god
53:11 - stick with understanding and mastering
53:13 - the basics
53:14 - first everybody out there
53:17 - has this crazy 80d adhd that is going on
53:21 - which is you want to learn
53:22 - every framework first react next js this
53:24 - that and the other thing
53:26 - do don't do that you are gonna screw
53:29 - yourself
53:29 - up permanently and for a really long
53:32 - time
53:33 - i've had so many horror stories i've
53:35 - heard from people who are going to
53:36 - coding boot camps
53:37 - they come out of coding boot camps we
53:39 - test them we test their skill
53:41 - and they're like
53:44 - and it's not just coding boot camps it's
53:46 - coming out of universities coming out of
53:48 - so please understand this the name of
53:52 - the game
53:52 - is mastering the basics bruce lee what
53:56 - does bruce lee say
53:58 - i am not scared of the man that knows a
54:00 - thousand
54:01 - kicks i'm scared of the man that has
54:04 - practiced
54:04 - one kick a thousand times
54:08 - that's the exact thing that happens as a
54:10 - developer
54:12 - you should be focused on problem solving
54:14 - increasing your problem solving skills
54:16 - you should be focused on you know how
54:19 - can i develop better data structure and
54:21 - algorithm skills
54:23 - those deep skills will last you a
54:25 - lifetime
54:26 - okay solve hard complicated problems on
54:30 - a consistent
54:31 - basis and work on projects that you're
54:33 - doing from scratch
54:34 - on your own that'll also make you really
54:37 - really good okay so please
54:39 - focus on the basics before you start
54:41 - pinballing
54:42 - and ping-ponging to 80 different things
54:45 - okay that is my advice
54:48 - to new javascript developers
54:54 - yo we should clip that one frankie
54:58 - we should clip that one okay so let's
55:00 - timestamp that one because that's gonna
55:01 - be helpful
55:02 - it can be a new video on its own um
55:07 - okay uh peter's question peter john
55:11 - scheer what is your opinion on vue.js by
55:14 - the way was that quite
55:15 - answer helpful for people yeah okay
55:19 - um so what is your opinion on vue.js as
55:21 - a europe-based developer
55:23 - is react the main javascript framework
55:26 - you would recommend
55:27 - no there's tons of jobs with vue as well
55:29 - okay and it's also really popular
55:31 - so pick your cup of tea and stick with
55:35 - it
55:35 - okay so if you like view pick view
55:38 - and go with it okay it's kind of like
55:40 - having a girlfriend

56:21 - thank you brother appreciate it
56:22 - what is laksha saying let's click it
56:26 - what all skills should one focus on in
56:28 - their first react.js
56:30 - job so that when you switch companies
56:31 - one to two years later you get a much
56:33 - higher pay
56:34 - great question what you should do as a
56:37 - react developer if you want to increase
56:39 - your pay in one to two years
56:41 - is become extremely valuable for that
56:44 - company
56:44 - okay go just beyond your job
56:47 - go just be go beyond just your skills
56:51 - but if you want to know here's what it
56:53 - is right
56:54 - always be learning as a developer what
56:56 - are the new hot skills that you can
56:58 - learn so as a react developer could you
56:59 - pick up next js as a framework
57:02 - then do it could you pick up graphql
57:05 - then do it complacency is the mother of
57:08 - all evil complacency happens
57:12 - when you clock in at nine you look at
57:14 - your time it's five
57:15 - and you leave do you know
57:18 - statistically speaking
57:20 - the people who stay ten percent later
57:23 - okay and these are real stats
57:25 - and it's going to surprise you people
57:27 - who stay 10
57:29 - later after work have their salaries
57:33 - increased
57:34 - 40 more than their average colleague or
57:38 - peer
57:40 - just by staying 10 longer you're making
57:44 - 40 percent more money those are the
57:46 - stats now let's break down why it works
57:48 - like that
57:49 - when the boss or somebody's thinking
57:51 - about who's gonna be the next promotion
57:53 - the person who's staying and
57:55 - grinding hard
57:56 - that's just a very very very simple
58:00 - bare bone example of the fact because
58:02 - the world doesn't work
58:04 - nine to five the world works 24 7. so
58:06 - when it comes to your skills
58:08 - and you wanting higher skills well you
58:11 - need to
58:11 - after you're done with work you need to
58:13 - go home and code and build something
58:16 - and maybe find a fun way if you have a
58:18 - wife maybe build an
58:19 - app for her with react every day when
58:22 - you go home
58:23 - if you have kids maybe work on a little
58:26 - game
58:27 - that you can make for them would react
58:29 - okay
58:30 - if you are working with the react and
58:33 - then you're doing other stuff that's
58:34 - more emotionally connected to you and
58:36 - you're
58:36 - constantly learning new skills you will
58:39 - be a million times more valuable
58:41 - developer
58:42 - but if you clock in at nine and you
58:44 - leave at five and that's all you do
58:46 - you're only your pay should only
58:48 - decrease your pay in my opinion should
58:51 - not increase
58:52 - that's my answer to that
59:01 - okay guys just
59:04 - keep strolling down fast i'll spot some
59:06 - things up

62:29 - out i mean guys it's badass
62:31 - right
62:33 - keep going let's go down are you to
62:34 - record courses and documentation enough
62:37 - for
62:38 - uh web developer i don't know maybe
62:41 - but if you wanted to become a heart
62:43 - surgeon or udemy courses and
62:44 - documentation enough
62:47 - probably not right get real mentorship
62:51 - go and invest in yourself learn master
62:53 - these skills
62:54 - it's not just enough to have one little
62:56 - course here and look is that enough
62:58 - is that okay
63:01 - yeah maybe but then there will be people
63:03 - like me and other people who like
63:05 - code and within three to six months have
63:08 - a job
63:09 - while other people are taking years to
63:10 - figure this out and this is not the flex
63:13 - or say anybody smarter than anybody it's
63:16 - because
63:17 - if you have a person like me who's
63:19 - coding for 10 to 15 hours a day
63:21 - and is going crazy trying to find the
63:23 - best mentors on the planet and
63:25 - investing in himself and hiring the best
63:27 - mentors on the planet with every dollar
63:29 - they make
63:30 - good luck catching up to that so
63:33 - that's three to six months of progress
63:34 - is gonna be something that's insane
63:36 - right um peter

63:51 - okay and the comment for everybody you
63:54 - know was basically
63:56 - grass is greener where you water it okay
63:59 - yes there could be somebody better but
64:01 - you have what you have you make that
64:03 -  better and you make that work
64:04 - and you improve that
64:06 - every single day that's why when people
64:08 - get into the battle of the frameworks
64:11 - to me that just tells me you're the
64:12 - person that's always looking for
64:13 - something better
