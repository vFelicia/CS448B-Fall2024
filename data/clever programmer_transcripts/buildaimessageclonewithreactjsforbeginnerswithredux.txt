00:59 - authentication
01:01 - everything is powered with redux so this
01:02 - is a for imessage clone
01:04 - and you can pretty much see it supports
01:06 - everything we want so let's go ahead and
01:08 - say
01:08 - yo this is insane
01:12 - and there you go and even has those nice
01:14 - little animations so if you guys
01:16 - want to see how to build that let me
01:18 - know right now
01:19 - get that energy up guys and we can go
01:22 - ahead and get this thing built
01:23 - uh for you guys so today's actually a
01:26 - pretty fun build
01:27 - we've got a lot going on here we have
01:30 - material ui
01:31 - we have all that fun stuff we have
01:33 - material ui we have firebase support in
01:36 - the back end so we have a real time
01:37 - back end right now here so let me go
01:40 - ahead and draw oh this is yesterday's
01:41 - session
01:42 - let's go ahead and show you guys so
01:43 - we've got a bit of material ui
01:45 - going on over here for these little
01:47 - icons the avatars
01:49 - being used over here we've got a really
01:51 - nice use case of flexbox
01:53 - in today's build and everything that you
01:56 - see here is powered
01:57 - by firebase so we're going to show you
02:00 - guys how to go ahead and
02:02 - power this up using firebase and then
02:04 - once that's done
02:06 - we're going to pretty much go ahead and
02:08 - completely get this thing built out with
02:10 - redux
02:11 - so redux is going to support everything
02:12 - it's pretty much how the user
02:14 - authentication is being stored at the
02:16 - moment
02:16 - so how we know which users logged in so
02:18 - right now obviously i'm the latest chat
02:19 - but let's go ahead and refresh this
02:21 - and you can see it signs me in
02:22 - automatically let's go ahead and sign
02:24 - out
02:24 - and sign back in as let's say i'm going
02:26 - to sign into cardi's account
02:28 - let's check this out um
02:31 - let's go ahead and check it out so now
02:33 - i'm in let's go ahead and see so now it
02:35 - says yellow
02:36 - and this one and here i'm going to say
02:38 - yo what's up sunny
02:39 - so i'm pretending to be kazzy right now
02:41 - and there you go comes up as kazi
02:43 - so it's kazzy's message right here and
02:45 - he says yo what's up sunny
02:47 - and what you can also do is you can
02:48 - actually create new channels so this
02:50 - button right here will actually go ahead
02:52 - and prompt out
02:53 - um i think it's hiding the prompt from
02:55 - me right now but this button right here
02:56 - basically when we click it
02:57 - yeah there we go uh and it's going to
02:59 - pop up saying enter our chat noise let's
03:00 - go ahead and type in youtube
03:02 - boom and we get a youtube channel and
03:05 - say
03:06 - let's go let's go guys let's
03:11 - go let me do a rocket emoji there we go
03:15 - and there we go guys so everything is up
03:16 - and running and it's all
03:18 - pretty good okay um let's go ahead and
03:22 - see
03:22 - i think everyone if you can see me right
03:24 - now in the build uh in the stream let me
03:26 - know in the comments i see some people
03:28 - freaking out about the glitching and
03:29 - stuff like that but it will be
03:30 - completely back up and running
03:32 - uh so don't worry about that if it's

05:05 - dude i agree so with that said guys
05:09 - let's go ahead and give you one more run
05:10 - through of the app so this is the app

05:14 - channels or chat rooms and what i'm
05:16 - going to do at the end if you stick
05:17 - around to the end
05:18 - so for everyone who's going to stick
05:20 - around to the end you guys are actually
05:21 - going to go ahead and get a chance to
05:22 - play with the app right so it's going to
05:24 - be pretty much fully functional you guys
05:25 - can see it working
05:26 - you can see everything built out and how
05:29 - we deploy and how we do all those that
05:30 - fun stuff
05:31 - um and also we just hit 300 people
05:33 - watching right now so
05:34 - amazing stuff guys thank you for the
05:36 - positive energy the love and support you
05:39 - guys
05:39 - always dropping and if you're ready for
05:41 - this build guys
05:42 - smash the thumbs up button let me know
05:45 - let's get this video out to so many more
05:47 - people
05:48 - so that way we can get um yeah we can
05:50 - get as much value out there as possible
05:51 - we're at 300 viewers
05:53 - that's insane um okay so one more
05:56 - run through of the app here is the app
05:58 - guys supports all of the google login
06:00 - functionality so if i go ahead and click
06:01 - sign
06:02 - in we've got all of our google login so
06:04 - you can see here's google authentication
06:06 - powered by firebase and then you've got
06:07 - this lovely react flip move animation so
06:10 - you see that guys
06:11 - that's pretty dope that's pretty clean
06:13 - right
06:14 - so with that said um let me know guys as
06:18 - well if you have actually gone ahead and
06:19 - used
06:20 - um redux before so if anyone's used
06:23 - redux before
06:24 - let me know because redux is something
06:26 - which is you're all gonna find super
06:27 - super valuable
06:28 - inside of a commercial environment so
06:30 - all of that good stuff
06:32 - they ask for redux experience um oh nice
06:35 - johanna's
06:36 - johannes sorry if i pronounced that one
06:38 - let's go papa react johannes from
06:40 - live from south africa starting my
06:41 - internship on monday good stuff dude
06:44 - good luck for your internship and that's
06:46 - what we're talking about
06:47 - um somebody says what's the difference
06:49 - between react
06:50 - js and redux so react.js is the library
06:53 - that we use to build progressive web
06:54 - apps
06:54 - uh redux is how it's called a state
06:56 - management library so it's pretty much
06:58 - how we manage
06:59 - the flow of data inside of the app so
07:01 - how we pretty much store everything
07:03 - inside of our date and inside of our app
07:05 - and go through all that cool stuff so
07:07 - we're going to pretty much go ahead and
07:08 - do that
07:09 - um right so
07:12 - uh garveet says hey sony has used this
07:14 - yesterday to completely show my bills
07:16 - off to my father
07:17 - so dude honestly if he's uh not willing
07:19 - to spend it it's completely fine just
07:21 - carry on doing it man like you can
07:22 - pretty much go ahead and keep learning
07:24 - and you can pretty much go like as far
07:26 - as you can go like and there's no limit
07:28 - you don't need to have special
07:31 - special materials or anything like that
07:32 - you can pretty much go ahead and just
07:33 - practice
07:34 - coding abilities and you know keep
07:36 - pushing your skill set and
07:38 - keep it good vibes you know positive
07:39 - energy and that's what we want to do so
07:41 - oh

09:51 - lag issues that we're having right now
09:53 - um yeah everything will have a way of
09:55 - figuring itself out
09:56 - so we're going to go ahead and use this
09:58 - command so it's mpx create react app but
10:00 - we're using dash dash template
10:02 - and then redux right so let's go ahead
10:05 - and open up a terminal

10:16 - react app
10:18 - and then rather than so here you
10:21 - basically say npx create react app and
10:22 - then the message of your app so here i'm
10:24 - going to go ahead and say

10:30 - and it's um a message clone
10:33 - and i'm gonna say youtube and then it's
10:35 - dash dash template redux

10:46 - trends in universities kudos
10:48 - to the clever programmer team for
10:49 - helping upcoming and existing force in
10:51 - industry
10:52 - um you guys are about to shift the
10:53 - paradigm dude that's exactly what we're
10:55 - aiming for honestly i i
10:57 - went to university and i found that like
10:58 - it's completely outdated everything is
11:00 - completely like you know
11:01 - it's just not really like it's not what
11:04 - you really need in the industry
11:06 - so we're trying to shift all of that and

11:09 - like uh the most sort of critical pieces
11:12 - of content and
11:13 - critical value to you guys and provide
11:15 - you with all that value so that way when
11:16 - you get into that sort of
11:18 - workplace or commercial environment you
11:19 - guys can just thrive and you guys can
11:21 - kill it
11:21 - okay uh and i agree with this good to
11:23 - see so many young programmers in the
11:25 - chat

11:48 - today
11:49 - and um we're gonna absolutely crush it
11:51 - today so jumping into the build
11:53 - we can see our terminal command just
11:55 - finished off so now we're going to go
11:57 - ahead and do cd imessage clone youtube
12:00 - and we're going to be inside of it and
12:01 - then i'm going to do code dash insiders
12:04 - for you guys it'll be the code dot but
12:07 - for me i've got the beta edition
12:09 - and then you want to go ahead and start
12:11 - up so this school should
12:12 - pop it up uh because

12:38 - in a while nice to see you back on the
12:39 - streams
12:40 - um okay so now what we're gonna do is
12:42 - make this full screen
12:44 - um for some reason spectacle's not
12:46 - working
12:47 - oh man okay my keyboard shortcuts aren't
12:50 - working one sec
12:52 - bear with me guys it's always like when
12:55 - i'm on
12:55 - live streams there we go all right so
12:57 - what i'm going to do now
12:59 - is go ahead and some reason this doesn't
13:01 - want to behave
13:03 - um all right give me one sec let me go
13:06 - ahead and open up a new terminal
13:08 - like this uh
13:11 - i wish i could build a book one on one
13:13 - coaching with sonny you can book a
13:14 - one-on-one coaching with me
13:16 - um why is my god damn it um
13:20 - okay never mind we can pretty much do it
13:22 - this way so with that said guys
13:26 - i'm gonna okay i need this shortcut give
13:29 - me one sec

13:32 - messes everything up so in the meantime
13:33 - let's go ahead and answer some questions
13:35 - from you guys
13:36 - and we can go ahead and do that so let
13:38 - me go ahead i'm going to
13:39 - close this and almost close the entire
13:43 - stream
13:45 - um i'm going to open it up again and
13:48 - now yay there we go guys so i use this
13:51 - i don't know if you guys know but i use
13:54 - this keyboard shortcut quite a lot
13:56 - and without it i think my build time
13:58 - would be extremely long
14:00 - so that's what i was trying to get to
14:02 - right now so i'm gonna close
14:03 - this one give me one sec guys one second
14:08 - there we go we're back we're back right
14:10 - energy's back let's go ahead and get

14:13 - now this is the shortcut i was talking
14:15 - about see
14:17 - it doesn't seem like much but trust me
14:20 - to be able to do that very quickly on a
14:22 - live stream it's very important so
14:24 - yeah and also guys yeah quick question
14:26 - who would buy some
14:28 - proper react merch so if you would let

14:47 - to go ahead and start up the app and
14:49 - while that's happening
14:50 - um it will actually go ahead and start
14:53 - up in localhost 3000
14:54 - so that's what we're going to do right
14:56 - here so this is our app
14:58 - running and here we go so this is what

15:14 - redux so redox is a state management
15:15 - tool
15:16 - and that's going to help you guys go
15:18 - ahead and manage the data flow inside of
15:20 - an app so here if i go ahead and do 20
15:22 - add amount you see adds by 20s if i do
15:24 - add async it's a little delay and that's
15:26 - meant to mimic
15:27 - the sort of network request and things
15:29 - like that okay um
15:33 - uh paulo says why using code and sizes
15:36 - uh so i'm actually i just like i'm a big
15:37 - fan of like beta tools i kind of messed
15:39 - around with beta stuff so
15:40 - you know go ahead and check out gaming
15:42 - mat says hoodies would be cool i know
15:44 - dude that's what i'm thinking like a
15:45 - like you know black hoodie with upper
15:47 - reactor still
15:48 - um yeah well we'll go into that in a bit
15:50 - so right now what we're going to do is
15:52 - the cleanup process
15:53 - so we're gonna go ahead and delete the
15:55 - app.test.js logo
15:57 - and setup tests.js over here move that
16:00 - to the trash
16:01 - and then we're gonna get this the app's
16:03 - gonna start freaking out so
16:05 - a few more things we're gonna do we're
16:07 - going to go inside of app.js delete
16:08 - everything inside of the header okay so
16:10 - we're going to go ahead and remove all
16:11 - of that
16:12 - say h1 and we're going to go ahead and
16:15 - say
16:16 - um
16:19 - nice powder says you have changed my
16:21 - life uh so yeah that's awesome stuff
16:23 - dude
16:24 - good stuff right here i'm going to say
16:26 - let's build
16:27 - the i message clone
16:31 - dope all right so we're going to go
16:32 - ahead and do that and then in
16:34 - the top here i'm gonna get rid of lines
16:36 - three and two
16:37 - save it go into app.css command a delete
16:40 - everything you don't want any
16:42 - pre-styling before we start in index.css
16:45 - i'm gonna show you guys
16:46 - we get this annoying bit of spacing at
16:49 - the top right
16:50 - so you see over here there's this a
16:52 - normal sort of uh
16:54 - annoying little gap over here we're
16:56 - going to get rid of that right now by
16:57 - going to the top
16:58 - going ahead doing asterisks and then
17:01 - saying margin
17:02 - colon zero and this will go ahead and
17:04 - reset the margins and now
17:05 - we have a starting canvas okay so that's
17:08 - going to be really really
17:09 - uh nice to start with um so
17:12 - with that said guys stop freaking out i
17:14 - can hear i can see so many people saying
17:16 - like i can't hear you yes you can
17:17 - i mean i can see the levels you guys can
17:19 - definitely hear me um
17:21 - right so with that said i'm going to go
17:23 - back to aptos yes let's get rid of that
17:26 - and then now well you see this features
17:30 - on the left right so features on the
17:32 - left what i want you guys to go ahead
17:33 - and do
17:34 - is go ahead and you want to first get
17:37 - rid of counter
17:38 - dot js encounter module we're not going
17:40 - to need those and then
17:42 - pull count a slice outside the photo
17:45 - right then you're going to see counter
17:47 - right here i'm going to right click
17:48 - click on delete because we don't want
17:50 - that folder that's actually a folder
17:51 - inside of features
17:52 - then i'm going to grab counter size and
17:54 - put it back in features
17:55 - so now should have a folder with that
17:58 - counter slice inside of right
18:00 - um hey fujiko's in the house what's up

18:12 - we're going to do is don't worry about
18:14 - all the jargon inside of here just yet
18:16 - but you see right now it's freaking out
18:18 - so we need to go to app store.js
18:20 - uh and then here you're going to pretty
18:22 - much go ahead get rid of the counter
18:25 - save it and that will get us to our
18:27 - starting point okay
18:29 - um so loads of people are always asking
18:31 - about what that command was why
18:33 - i first used so it was like something
18:34 - like this where i did code insiders dash
18:37 - right um dot
18:38 - so what you want to do is command shift
18:40 - p inside of code inside or inside of
18:43 - your vs code
18:46 - oh man bless you again hey fever already
18:50 - um so what we're going to do and yeah i
18:52 - will slow down in a sec this is just
18:53 - because this is the starting point
18:55 - so here we're going to go ahead and do
18:57 - shell command
18:59 - and then we're going to say install code

20:00 - and this is for the bem naming
20:01 - convention okay
20:03 - so this is known as bem naming
20:04 - convention so this is how you name your
20:07 - classes
20:08 - and react to make it more sort of easier
20:10 - to work with easier to scale and that
20:12 - sort of stuff okay
20:13 - so with that said we're gonna go ahead
20:16 - and
20:17 - start the first part of the build so the
20:19 - first thing i want to do guys is

21:05 - sorry
21:06 - and the sidebar component so this thing
21:08 - over here right
21:09 - so we're going to go ahead and do that
21:10 - first so the first thing
21:13 - is um psycho coda says sonny do you
21:15 - remember the debate over bam comment in
21:17 - one

21:31 - otherwise you're gonna get blocked and
21:33 - you're not coming back all right
21:34 - so now we're gonna go ahead and create
21:37 - and what i'm gonna do today is i'm gonna
21:38 - show you why
21:39 - i'm gonna create an imessage component
21:41 - right so this is gonna have this entire
21:43 - app inside of it
21:45 - and this one i'm going to go ahead and
21:46 - create right now because it's going to
21:48 - freak out because there's no imessage
21:50 - component
21:52 - whoa check this out
21:56 - gabriel damn dude he goes
21:59 - come on everyone show your support this
22:01 - channel is cheaper than

22:05 - appreciate you gabriel that is
22:07 - insane uh huge 20 donation
22:10 - uh thank you so much and yeah that is
22:12 - that really really awesome stuff and
22:13 - that's the kind of energy that we want
22:15 - in this channel
22:16 - this is the kind of people we want in
22:17 - this channel thank you so much dude
22:18 - appreciate you
22:20 - uh somebody also says do you love yeah i
22:22 - mean i i'm interested in fly i know
22:24 - kelly hayden does a lot of flat stuff so
22:26 - i've been looking in that space as well
22:28 - um so i'm going to create
22:30 - i'm going to create a component called
22:33 - imessage.js
22:34 - right and then i'm going to use my
22:35 - beautiful rfce trick
22:37 - to go ahead and create the snippet and
22:40 - then i'm going to say import
22:42 - imessage imessage.css
22:46 - i'm going to create a corresponding css
22:48 - file so now we go back and it's going to
22:50 - freak out so we're going to create an
22:52 - imessage dss file so imessage.css
22:56 - and then you guys are going to go ahead
22:57 - and see that it's still freaking out and
22:58 - this is because inside of app.js we need
23:01 - to import
23:04 - so i'm going to say import imessage
23:07 - from imessage
23:12 - imessage there we go what's my thing
23:15 - acting all with okay
23:16 - yeah and now pretty much i'm going to
23:17 - render the entire app in here okay
23:19 - so this is going to be there is a
23:20 - purpose for this and it will show you
23:22 - exactly
23:22 - how we're going to do that soon um but
23:25 - for now
23:25 - i want you guys to do is go ahead and
23:27 - type in imessage here and
23:29 - then we're going to go to our code and
23:32 - this is not going to be camel case just
23:34 - for simplicity
23:35 - yeah because sometimes some people might
23:37 - do it you know capital m some people
23:39 - might not so we're going to keep it
23:40 - super simple
23:41 - going back we've got there are two
23:43 - things inside of here right
23:44 - we've got the sidebar and we've got the
23:46 - chat that's what i mentioned before so
23:48 - if we go back to our app before we had
23:50 - the sidebar and the chat
23:51 - so um where's my drawing tools
23:54 - my beautiful drawing tools all right so
23:56 - now we've got this sidebar element
23:59 - right and then we've got this chat
24:01 - element okay so i'm going to create
24:02 - those two here so that's what we've got
24:04 - over here
24:05 - so that's why i like to do this little
24:07 - commenting right here because it helps
24:08 - you sort of
24:09 - you know piece together what you're
24:11 - going to have inside of the app
24:12 - um so call mile says when would you do a
24:16 - class
24:16 - function verse functional i would say
24:18 - always triangle with functional
24:19 - functions more the modern approach and
24:21 - you should be able to go and check that
24:23 - instead um hey daniel says yo papa react
24:27 - what's up dude glad to see you in in in
24:30 - today's video so what we're going to do
24:32 - is we're going to first build the
24:33 - sidebar right
24:34 - so i'm going to go ahead and say sidebar
24:37 - go ahead create the file
24:39 - so sidebar dot js
24:42 - rfce i'm going to go ahead and shut that
24:45 - down and then here i'm gonna say
24:47 - this is the sort of you know the setup
24:48 - every time we create a new component
24:50 - we're gonna create the css file that
24:52 - goes along with it we go ahead and set
24:54 - up the div with the bem naming
24:55 - convention so here i'm gonna say
24:57 - sidebar boom done and i'm going to write
24:59 - h2 saying i
25:00 - am the sidebar there we go and then i'm
25:03 - going to go over here create the
25:05 - sidebar.css
25:07 - and there we go all right so we have
25:09 - that done go over to imessage and let's
25:11 - go ahead and pop an import on this
25:13 - so i'm going to actually make this a
25:14 - little bit bigger for you guys so that
25:16 - way you guys can see it there we go
25:18 - um and then here i'm going to say import
25:21 - why isn't my clever little trick working
25:23 - oh yeah there we go
25:25 - so control space by the end of the line
25:27 - here and it will go ahead and import it
25:28 - for you
25:29 - and then we can go ahead and do uh thank
25:32 - you so much to
25:33 - to fikou rahman's tommy

25:48 - thumbs up button because we hear a
25:49 - thousand likes to them yesterday and i
25:51 - think we can go ahead
25:53 - and um we can break a thousand today as
25:55 - well so if lucha code elizabeth says
25:56 - that trick is a game changer along with
25:58 - emmett
25:59 - 100 it makes you such a faster developer
26:02 - right so that's gonna be really really
26:04 - cool for you
26:05 - um oh why papa meron popper is not
26:08 - popping up today
26:09 - hey david will be back in the channel
26:11 - hey i'm gonna give i'm gonna let david
26:12 - know that he said that
26:13 - um so we've got the sidebar here right
26:16 - so what i'm gonna do
26:17 - is actually render it out so you see it
26:18 - says i am the sidebar so we know it's
26:20 - working
26:21 - um somebody says is it too late to start
26:23 - coding at 17 hell no dude
26:25 - start as soon as you want or later you
26:27 - want doesn't matter man
26:28 - just start all right the next thing i'm
26:30 - going to do is create the chat component
26:32 - so actually let's go ahead and build out
26:33 - the sidebar first
26:34 - all right so
26:38 - um ayush patel says it's 1.5 k now for
26:40 - yesterday damn
26:41 - yeah so like see we're making moves on
26:43 - that so sidebar
26:44 - let's go here and what i'm going to do
26:45 - is you guys like this when i did this
26:47 - yesterday
26:48 - i'm going to drop the sidebar underneath
26:51 - my code like this so you can see my css
26:53 - underneath and my code at the top
26:54 - that's a kind of easier way to visualize
26:56 - it as well so i think it might help you
26:58 - guys out
26:59 - now the first thing we're going to do is
27:00 - i'm going to have a header section so
27:01 - the header section
27:03 - is going to reference this bit over here
27:06 - okay so this is the
27:07 - the sidebar header so i'm going to go
27:09 - over here and create a div
27:11 - called sidebar i'm going to say header
27:13 - okay so over here we've got the div with
27:15 - the sidebar header
27:16 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
27:18 - going to create another one and this
27:19 - one's going to be called sidebar chat so
27:22 - div sidebar i'm just going to score
27:24 - chats
27:25 - and that's going to be responsible for
27:27 - you guessed it these
27:29 - this list of chats over here okay so
27:33 - we're going to go ahead and do that
27:34 - right now inside of sidebar header so
27:37 - you see we use
27:38 - we use material ui in a bunch of places
27:40 - right now we've got it for this icon
27:42 - right here
27:43 - we're going for this icon over here so
27:45 - the avatar being shown over here
27:47 - and we're going for this little pencil
27:48 - icon that we use to create a new channel
27:50 - so in order to do that we need to go
27:52 - ahead and install material ui
27:54 - right those people asking what's the
27:56 - best way to then react just watch this
27:57 - channel man
27:58 - watch this channel watch the builds go
28:00 - ahead and do that and that will be your
28:02 - quickest most effective way of doing it
28:04 - so we're going to go here i'm going to
28:05 - do material ui.com
28:08 - so you can just google it and it should
28:09 - pop up then you want to run this command
28:11 - npm install material ui
28:12 - call right so this command is very
28:14 - important right now
28:16 - so then what i'm going to do is go back
28:19 - to my terminal so i'm going to hit
28:20 - command j to bring up
28:22 - terminal right now we have it running
28:23 - here i'm going to hit this little plus
28:25 - icon
28:25 - and we should see a second terminal pop
28:27 - up and then i'm going to go ahead and do
28:28 - npm install material ui core
28:30 - right anthony what's up dude he says yo
28:33 - sonny
28:34 - uh that's awesome just dude oh sorry i
28:37 - was responding to another comment as i
28:38 - had that one pinned
28:39 - um right
28:44 - yeah still okay so with that done we're
28:46 - going to install that
28:47 - then we're going to go back here go to
28:48 - the top where it says search
28:50 - and then i'm going to say icons and
28:51 - thank you so much for charlie for
28:53 - putting a little code snippet in the
28:54 - chat that will help a lot of people out
28:56 - here with the installation i'm going to
28:58 - go ahead and do material ui icon so we
29:00 - need to install the core
29:02 - and the icon set okay so those are two
29:05 - things that we need to do
29:06 - to get started um if you guys are
29:08 - enjoying this by the way let me know
29:12 - we'll keep the builds coming
29:15 - all right so
29:19 - back to the build here now i'm going to
29:22 - hit command j to hide it
29:24 - and the first thing i'm going to do is
29:26 - at the top over here
29:27 - i'm going to have
29:30 - the so we have the avatar right
29:34 - so i'm going to go here and i'm going to
29:35 - say avatar
29:37 - and then here i'm going to say source
29:39 - right now the source at this point we
29:42 - don't have an image for it so i'm just
29:43 - going to leave this blank
29:44 - okay and this will go ahead and it'll
29:46 - pop like a dummy avatar in
29:48 - so it says avatar is not defined so here
29:49 - i'm going to hit control space at the
29:51 - end it says auto import from material ui
29:53 - gives me the import statement um
29:57 - i'm going to go ahead and save it
29:58 - refresh avatar is not defined
30:00 - should be defined now
30:04 - so let's go ahead and refresh we should
30:07 - see it there we go
30:08 - all right so it says i'm the sidebar and
30:09 - we've got the avatar popping up which is
30:11 - the little icon right here
30:12 - uh mando loves the emma emmett trick
30:14 - yeah obviously emmitt is insane man and
30:16 - it makes you such a fast decoder so
30:18 - make sure you take full advantage of
30:20 - that the next thing we're gonna do is
30:21 - create sidebar underscore underscore
30:23 - input
30:24 - boom i'm gonna do that oops input
30:28 - and then i'm gonna go ahead and inside
30:30 - of here i'm gonna have a few things i'm
30:32 - gonna have to search
30:33 - icon right so the search icon we can
30:36 - pull in from material ui so i've got the
30:38 - import up here
30:40 - so i'm going to go ahead and pull that
30:41 - in
30:43 - i'm going to close this to make it
30:44 - easier for you guys to see
30:47 - and then and then i'm going to go back
30:50 - down
30:51 - and create an input right so this is
30:53 - going to be an input
30:54 - the placeholder of search so you see
30:57 - right now we're starting to pop out some
30:58 - of the stuff
30:59 - now we don't need to say i am the
31:00 - sidebar we don't really care about that
31:02 - also where we say let's build the
31:03 - messenger clone imessage coming here and
31:05 - that
31:07 - so going back here we're going to go
31:09 - ahead and do
31:10 - so and david to work on that bro so
31:13 - loads of people are looking forward to
31:14 - the imessage
31:15 - uh to the react native stuff it's coming
31:18 - just bear with me okay
31:19 - it's coming guys it's coming it's a lot
31:21 - of work going on behind the scenes
31:22 - um yeah it's definitely on his way um
31:25 - then we're gonna go ahead and after this
31:27 - we're gonna have
31:29 - the another icon button right so we're
31:31 - gonna have
31:32 - that little icon over here you guys see
31:35 - i'm gonna go ahead and pull that in
31:37 - so the thing to go ahead and do that is
31:39 - it's actually called this
31:40 - right here so it's called rate review
31:43 - outlined icon
31:44 - so i'm to go ahead and import that from
31:46 - material ui so
31:47 - pull that in at the top and then
31:50 - save it and we should see that in just a
31:53 - second
31:53 - and what i can do is you see right now
31:55 - this is not clickable
31:57 - right so to make a but an icon clickable
31:59 - with material ui
32:01 - all you need to do is actually pretty
32:02 - simple you go ahead and you import
32:03 - something called icon button
32:05 - yeah so i didn't auto import and then
32:08 - basically
32:09 - this takes a child so pretty much you go
32:11 - ahead and expand it i'm going to pop the
32:12 - icon inside of it
32:14 - and that will actually make this
32:16 - clickable so you see now we get that
32:17 - beautiful ripple effect
32:18 - so if you didn't know that and you now
32:21 - know that so go ahead and
32:23 - um go ahead and
32:26 - and hit the thumbs up button also thank

32:52 - today which is why we're keeping the
32:53 - speed nice and high
32:55 - okay so next thing you know we've got
32:58 - the icon button right so i'm going to
32:59 - give the icon button a class
33:01 - so i'm going to here i'm going to say
33:02 - class name of sidebar chats
33:06 - sidebar chats like this save it and then
33:09 - i'm going to go
33:10 - no no sidebar chat sorry it should be
33:12 - sidebar
33:13 - uh input button we're going to go ahead
33:16 - and use that so we can reference this
33:17 - afterwards
33:18 - and then i'm going to make also i'm
33:19 - going to give this a variant okay so i'm
33:21 - going to say this is a variant
33:23 - and i'm going to go ahead and say
33:25 - outlined also guys if you're following
33:26 - along with it right
33:28 - try not to be following line by line and
33:30 - just copying things
33:31 - try and watch it and enjoy the content
33:33 - right and oh
33:34 - snap check this out so athaba is inside
33:37 - the course we work with him and he's a
33:38 - dope student um
33:40 - and he's actually gone ahead and he
33:42 - wrote a blog with us
33:44 - it's on medium right now on the clever
33:46 - program you guys can go ahead and check
33:47 - it out
33:48 - but we just oh that's so sick man we
33:50 - just dropped an amazon 50 page plus
33:53 - blog and it's now reached 3.3 k views
33:57 - uh well done nata that was insane dude i
33:59 - really really enjoyed
34:00 - that read as well so crazy stuff man and
34:03 - and well done
34:05 - right oh i pinned it here as well uh
34:08 - let's go back
34:09 - okay so now we're gonna we have the
34:12 - sidebar chat section underneath so i'm
34:13 - gonna go ahead and first start a bit at
34:15 - the top
34:15 - thank you rag vender for the super chat
34:18 - appreciate you dude um
34:21 - so i'm going to save that and now let's
34:22 - go ahead and style this so it looks a
34:24 - little bit more like the top right so
34:25 - i'm going to go ahead pull up the
34:26 - sidebar
34:27 - oops pull up the sidebar.css split that
34:31 - page over here
34:33 - and then we've got our stuff over there
34:34 - and we don't need as much room so i'm
34:36 - going to do that
34:37 - now here what i'm going to do
34:41 - is go ahead and for the sidebar i'm
34:43 - going to say dot sidebar
34:45 - and i'm going to apply the following
34:46 - thing so i want this to take up 35
34:48 - the screens if you notice here this is
34:50 - actually taking up only 35
34:52 - the screen and the remainder is 65 the
34:55 - screen
34:56 - okay so this is taking up 35 on the
34:59 - screen
35:00 - yep and this is taking up the chat is
35:02 - taking up 65
35:03 - of the screen so in order to do that
35:05 - what we do
35:06 - is we go ahead and say
35:11 - we go ahead and we say flex 0.35
35:15 - and then we can go ahead and save it
35:17 - let's go back here
35:18 - and you're not going to notice that
35:19 - right now because we haven't actually
35:20 - applied flex to our app so let's go back
35:22 - to app.css
35:24 - go ahead and do the following we just
35:25 - need to say display flex
35:28 - right and we can close that go back here
35:32 - and then i can say height of a hundred
35:34 - view height
35:35 - that's what we want to do and i'm going
35:36 - to say it should have display flex
35:38 - the flex direction of column because
35:40 - everything inside of it we want it to go
35:42 - down
35:42 - yo what's up david david's in the house
35:45 - guys
35:46 - let david know if you're excited for
35:47 - some more man builds
35:49 - and that's gonna be insane um so let him
35:51 - know right now he's in the chat have a
35:53 - chat with david
35:54 - and uh we love you david awesome stuff
35:57 - man all right
35:58 - so then i'm going to go ahead and create
35:59 - a give it a background color so i'm
36:01 - going to go ahead and give that a little
36:02 - background color so now you can see it's
36:03 - taking up 35
36:04 - the screen and it works as we want it
36:06 - right then i'm going to give it a border
36:08 - right
36:09 - so let's go ahead and give it a border
36:10 - right one pixel solid like gray
36:12 - you see it's very subtle but it kind of
36:14 - gives a nice little design
36:16 - trait right um okay
36:19 - so next thing is the header so i'm gonna
36:22 - go ahead and pop a snippet in over here
36:24 - so we're gonna go here
36:26 - i'm gonna go and say sidebar header
36:28 - should have display flex
36:30 - align the item centrally the padding
36:32 - should be
36:33 - um the padding should be 10 pixels and a
36:36 - height of 50 pixels okay
36:38 - and then for the avatar right i want to
36:41 - have this clickable so right now it
36:42 - doesn't like it's clickable
36:44 - so i'm going to go down here and i'm
36:45 - going to first i'm going to give this a
36:46 - class name
36:48 - so i can style it in an easier way i'm
36:49 - going to say sidebar underscore
36:51 - underscore avatar
36:53 - bam naming convention in for the win and
36:55 - then i'm going to go ahead and paste it
36:57 - here
36:57 - so it says sidebar avatar cursor pointer
37:00 - margin 10 pixels now you can see
37:02 - look at that gives me a nice little like
37:04 - the cursor changes to that finger
37:06 - right so that's going to be a lot more
37:08 - of a user a nicer user experience
37:11 - okay so that's looking good now what
37:14 - we're going to do is get this
37:16 - input looking nice right so the sidebar
37:19 - input let's go ahead and do that so i'm
37:20 - going to make this a bit easier
37:22 - for you guys to see um actually so this
37:24 - is the sidebar input
37:26 - then we're styling it down here so
37:29 - i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to
37:30 - say sidebar underscore underscore
37:32 - input and i'm going to say oops
37:36 - i'm going to say display flex boom and
37:39 - then you can see everything gets pulled
37:40 - in centrally i'm going to say align item
37:42 - center
37:43 - and then we'll say justify content
37:44 - center as well because i want my
37:46 - everything to kind of be centered
37:48 - equally as it gets bigger when i say
37:50 - flex one i want this to take up the most
37:52 - room
37:52 - in that container you might not tell now
37:54 - but if i make this bigger
37:56 - i mean it's limited to 35 but you always
37:59 - want to
37:59 - have it being responsive if something
38:01 - changes background color let's go ahead
38:03 - and give it a background color
38:04 - save that and you can see we're starting
38:06 - to get this little
38:08 - background color over here hadi says
38:10 - hello sunny what's up dude
38:11 - good to see you here and then we're
38:13 - going to go ahead and change the color
38:14 - of the text to gray so i'm going to go
38:16 - ahead and say color gray and
38:18 - then i'm going to say border radius of 5
38:20 - pixels
38:21 - all right you're probably wondering this
38:22 - don't look nothing like this
38:24 - right so how do we get it to finishing
38:27 - stage right now
38:28 - we're going to go ahead and target the
38:29 - inner input because right now we're
38:31 - targeting the div
38:32 - so here i'm going to say sidebar input
38:34 - and then target the inner input
38:37 - and we're going to go ahead and say
38:38 - border of none
38:40 - save it okay it's looking a little bit
38:42 - better
38:43 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
38:45 - background transparent
38:47 - okay okay that's looking clean
38:51 - and then the final thing is you see when
38:52 - i click it we don't we get this horrible
38:54 - blue outline
38:55 - so to get rid of that we go here and we
38:56 - say outline width and make it a zero
38:59 - save it and now boom we don't get the
39:02 - outline width
39:03 - all right so it's a neat little trick
39:04 - for you guys so we can go ahead and save
39:07 - it
39:08 - and then uh i'm gonna go ahead and check
39:11 - also the input button right so the input
39:15 - button
39:16 - everything's good now yeah so awesome
39:19 - so with that said now we're gonna go to
39:21 - the sidebar chats
39:22 - right so the sidebar chats so this
39:25 - section right here
39:26 - now in this section is where we have
39:28 - everything
39:29 - looking like this right so we have all
39:31 - these sort of sidebar chats individually

39:53 - you can pretty much go ahead and use
39:55 - firebase or you can use the man stack to

43:27 - really really amazing um there's also
43:31 - another one i saw
43:32 - uh i can't find it now but somebody else
43:34 - had another success story so
43:36 - live code says how many years of
43:37 - experience do you have with the react
43:39 - um at this point i'd say maybe
43:43 - maybe four three three or four four
43:46 - years maybe
43:47 - four years yeah potentially but doesn't
43:49 - matter once you even if you have one
43:51 - month
43:51 - you can make money with that right so
43:54 - you just need to
43:55 - keep the positive energy uh you don't
43:57 - need a huge amount of experience you
43:59 - just need to stop
44:00 - right next thing we're gonna do is
44:02 - create sidebar so i'm gonna say sidebar
44:05 - chat underscore underscore info
44:09 - right and inside of here we're gonna
44:10 - have a h3 with a channel name so it's
44:12 - gonna say channel name
44:13 - and this will obviously be like one of
44:15 - these like yo testing test while youtube
44:17 - and so forth and then i'm gonna have a p
44:20 - tag
44:21 - this is going to have the last message
44:22 - that was sent so imagine if i'm inside
44:24 - of this
44:25 - and we say abc you see it says abc
44:28 - because it's the last message that was
44:29 - sent
44:30 - so i'm going to say last message sent
44:33 - dot dot
44:34 - keep the suspense you know and then i'm
44:37 - going to go ahead and add a
44:38 - small tag so it's just a small piece of
44:40 - text and this is going to be a time
44:42 - stamp
44:43 - right so again it's going to be like a
44:45 - little timestamp in the corner
44:46 - i'm just going to add it in for now like
44:48 - this all right with that said
44:50 - we're going to go and style this to make
44:53 - it look
44:53 - a little bit more like this right now
44:55 - okay um
44:57 - thank you so much uh rosh kneebarad says
44:59 - love all your videos keep you up
45:01 - keep up the support dude really
45:02 - appreciate you um
45:05 - what happens after you log in refresh
45:07 - off the login jonathan jonathan jonathan
45:09 - check this out dude so i'm logged in
45:11 - right now
45:11 - for refresh boom logs me in
45:15 - we have persistence with redox and
45:17 - google authentication so
45:19 - it's uh it's really powerful okay
45:22 - um going back to the react redux
45:26 - so here what we're gonna do is we're
45:29 - gonna open up our sidebar chat
45:32 - dot css sidebar chat
45:35 - and then here i'm gonna start coding
45:38 - these styles first thing i wanna do is
45:40 - say dot sidebar
45:43 - chat and then open parentheses display
45:46 - flex and then i'm going to say align
45:49 - item centrally
45:50 - and then save it and you can see
45:51 - everything goes into a line right then
45:53 - i'm going to say padding
45:54 - i'm going to say 20 pixels because i
45:57 - want to give it a bit more spacing
45:58 - around it
45:59 - i'm gonna give it a border bottom of one
46:01 - pixel light gray solid
46:03 - do that boom gives that a nice thing and
46:05 - then i also want it to have a cursor
46:07 - when i hover over it
46:08 - right because we want that sort of nice
46:10 - uh user experience so cursor pointer
46:13 - and then there we go so somebody says
46:16 - how is this build different from
46:17 - whatsapp clone apart from the ui
46:19 - so firstly the whatsapp film wasn't
46:20 - built with redux whatsapp chrome was
46:22 - built with the react context api
46:24 - um so no it's going to be a little bit
46:26 - different to that
46:28 - secondly we have a few other elements so
46:31 - the build is slightly different to the
46:32 - whatsapp clone
46:33 - but yeah the main thing here is redux is
46:35 - powering it all so redux is the thing
46:37 - that's going to land you the job as as
46:39 - opposed to
46:40 - um as opposed to somebody who who won't
46:43 - get the job redux something which you're
46:45 - gonna need
46:45 - when you're applying for professional
46:47 - jobs and i really recommend you learn it
46:49 - right now
46:50 - so starting with this clone uh preshoon
46:53 - thank you so much dude he says donated
46:55 - 20 uh
46:56 - real things rupees in your imessage
46:58 - clone you guys are taking such great
46:59 - efforts to make these brilliant
47:00 - tutorials
47:01 - this is just a small token of
47:02 - appreciation dude for an 11 year old
47:04 - thank you
47:05 - so much man that is really really
47:07 - awesome
47:08 - thank you going back
47:11 - i'm going to make a hover effect i'm
47:13 - going to say when we hover over it
47:15 - i'm going to change the background color
47:16 - to blue and the color of the text to
47:18 - white
47:19 - let's go ahead and do that save it and
47:20 - now you can see we get this
47:23 - you see we're building this pretty fast
47:24 - man so now if i go ahead and hover over
47:27 - it
47:27 - looks really good okay we're almost at
47:30 - 500 likes as well guys
47:32 - at 402 so let's keep pushing that like
47:35 - count get this video out to as many
47:37 - people as possible oh nice many says
47:40 - maybe a suggestion for next video is to
47:42 - start components 100 style components
47:45 - react native ragna is something fun
47:48 - coming
47:49 - right next thing we're going to do is
47:51 - start the info section
47:52 - so here i'm going to go ahead and say
47:55 - sidebar info go ahead and hide the sign
47:58 - and then i'm going to go ahead and do a
48:00 - margin left
48:01 - because right now it's touching the
48:03 - avatar right here i don't want that i'm
48:05 - going to say margin
48:07 - left of 15 pixels
48:10 - okay save it it pushes it slightly away
48:13 - that's nice and then i'm going to go
48:14 - ahead and do position relative
48:16 - because i want that time stamp inside
48:18 - afterwards to be on the top right
48:20 - i'm also going to say width of 100
48:24 - okay now next thing i'm going to do is
48:26 - i'm going to target the small tag that
48:28 - we added in inside of this i'm going to
48:29 - say
48:30 - go inside the container the info
48:32 - container and the small tag
48:34 - and i'm going to say make it position
48:35 - absolute but because we made the parent
48:37 - relative it's actually not going to
48:39 - behave in a crazy way
48:41 - right if i do this and i say top 5
48:43 - pixels away from the top
48:45 - now you can see it sticks to the top if
48:47 - i say go to the right of zero
48:49 - and now you see the time stamps over
48:51 - there right
48:52 - so this is how we do these kind of
48:54 - things right and we get those little
48:56 - things
48:57 - uh in place so as a young person can i
48:59 - still make money programming
49:00 - dude 100 billion percent we have people
49:03 - inside of profit with javascript
49:04 - right now right let me let me just send
49:07 - the message out right now
49:08 - if you're young if you're old it doesn't
49:10 - matter what the case right whatever age
49:12 - you are
49:13 - yeah as if you're here right now so
49:15 - you're starting off that coding journey
49:16 - okay
49:17 - now it just followed up with another one
49:18 - so he's 11 years old
49:20 - and he says what do i need to to know to
49:22 - start coding
49:23 - to start learning react whoa dude
49:26 - damn that's a big donation that's uh i'm
49:29 - i'm not sure how much that is dude
49:31 - uh but thank you so much and i'll answer
49:33 - the other question afterwards but
49:34 - william wong says
49:36 - you are giving me clean and clear
49:38 - understanding from modern javascript
49:40 - development
49:40 - without tons of reading docs so thank
49:42 - you very much and the pwj community
49:44 - william wong thank you dude and we love
49:47 - the energy that people like you bring
49:49 - into the community so
49:50 - amazing amazing stuff really really
49:53 - appreciate that big donation dude
49:55 - now back to the question as to if you're
49:57 - young and you're in a code
49:58 - what i would say is look you're here
50:00 - right now you're in the right place
50:01 - right
50:02 - what i also want you to do right now and
50:03 - this is everyone watching right now
50:05 - go into the description sign up to the
50:07 - free training right the tree free
50:09 - webinar training the reason being
50:12 - because that is a
50:13 - free training guys and that's going to
50:15 - allow you to go ahead and get
50:16 - you know more free value so if you
50:18 - haven't already signed up to that make
50:20 - sure you go ahead and do it let me know
50:21 - in the comments after you've done that
50:23 - right and then go ahead and check it out
50:26 - um also somebody says hey sonny what do
50:29 - you think would be a great way
50:30 - to not lose touch with an old
50:32 - programming language you've learned for
50:34 - example you're learning javascript and
50:35 - you're forgetting python
50:36 - okay very good question but i'll quickly
50:38 - answer this one then we'll carry on with
50:39 - the build
50:39 - right what i would say to this question
50:41 - is you're never actually going to go
50:43 - ahead and learn
50:44 - you're never going to go ahead and
50:45 - forget sorry the languages before so
50:48 - for example i've coded in python plenty
50:49 - of times before but i haven't coded it
50:51 - in ages
50:52 - doesn't mean i forgot python but if you
50:54 - understand
50:55 - programming principles well for example
50:58 - data types
50:58 - like what is an array how what is a four
51:01 - loop what is a loop uh
51:02 - you know it was a four sorry um like
51:05 - was it if condition sorry and a for loop
51:07 - and things like that then as long as you
51:09 - know that
51:10 - right then those things are transferable
51:12 - doesn't matter what language you're
51:14 - coding in right they're just pretty much
51:15 - you can go ahead and hop between them
51:16 - and it really doesn't matter so if i
51:18 - need to code in python tomorrow
51:20 - you can pretty much use all the skills i
51:21 - have from today and pretty much go ahead
51:23 - and pick up python really quick so
51:25 - that's why
51:25 - i'm gonna go ahead and mess out with
51:27 - mess around with uh react native again
51:29 - react native is javascript so it's gonna
51:31 - be very easy to transition over to but
51:32 - also things like flutter
51:34 - flutter is something which i would
51:35 - recommend going and checking out gabriel
51:37 - graves says
51:38 - that big donation by william wong was
51:40 - 19.35 dude amazing thank you so much
51:44 - um and appreciate taruna coogan says
51:46 - thank you so much bro
51:47 - thank you dude for watching um yeah i
51:50 - love the energy today guys
51:51 - really really positive stuff right
51:55 - so this is looking good right so we can
51:57 - pretty much all of these avatars we can
51:59 - go ahead and
52:00 - customize it with a picture in a bit
52:03 - for now what i'm going to do is go back
52:05 - to this
52:06 - sidebar.js i'm going to go ahead and
52:09 - copy it and basically just paste it out
52:10 - to test it so imagine we had a bunch of
52:12 - channels
52:13 - there you go we can pretty much this is
52:14 - starting to look a lot like our build
52:16 - right
52:16 - now if i was to go ahead and spam this
52:21 - thing
52:22 - so that it goes a bit longer you see it
52:23 - we kind of broke the page
52:26 - right the page isn't really working in
52:27 - the way we expect it to
52:29 - so to fix this what we're going to do is
52:31 - we're going to go over to our sidebar.js
52:34 - sidebar.css sorry and what i'm going to
52:37 - do is target sidebar chats
52:39 - so sidebar.css i'm going to pull this
52:42 - underneath
52:43 - i'm going to target sidebar chats and
52:46 - inside of sidebar chats what i'm going
52:48 - to say is i'm going to say overflow
52:50 - scroll right so as soon as i do that now
52:53 - now it has a scrolling functionality
52:55 - right so that's a lot more cleaner
52:57 - and would be uh really really like much
53:01 - more of a nice user experience doesn't
53:02 - look broken anymore right
53:04 - um so and also i don't want this
53:07 - horrible scroll bar but i want to keep
53:08 - the scrolling functionality
53:10 - right uh right so sun kit dev says i've
53:14 - watched signed up for the webinars and
53:15 - one and it's important i'm now confused
53:16 - with to watch this or the webinar
53:18 - so honestly for the webinar we we show
53:20 - that quite a few times so don't worry
53:22 - watch this
53:23 - for now and then you can watch the
53:25 - webinar afterwards um so
53:26 - yeah that's a good way of doing it um
53:30 - a lot of people said can we expect react
53:33 - me it builds later on 100 dude
53:35 - react native is coming later on um
53:39 - somebody says do you need to learn
53:40 - vanilla javascript before learning react
53:42 - i would recommend learning the basics
53:44 - we do teach the basics inside a profit
53:46 - with javascript if you're interested in
53:47 - joining cleverprogrammer.com forward
53:49 - slash pwj
53:52 - right um okay so overflow scrub so
53:56 - there's a little trick that i want to
53:57 - show you guys and what you can do is
53:58 - this there's a snippet of code i'm gonna
54:00 - pop in here
54:01 - and this right here the top one hides
54:03 - the scroll bar for chrome safari and
54:05 - oprah
54:06 - the bottom one holds it for internet
54:07 - explorer edge and firefox once we don't
54:09 - really care about
54:10 - and let's start war with that but
54:13 - then what we're going to do is save it
54:15 - and you can see now we get all that
54:16 - space back
54:17 - right so that's a lot cleaner um but you
54:20 - still have that scrolling functionality
54:21 - right so that's a lot nicer way of doing
54:23 - it we're going to use props to basically
54:25 - customize these so that way they can
54:26 - have different values but that's a step
54:29 - for afterwards um for now what i'm going
54:32 - to do is i'm just going to go ahead and
54:34 - just
54:34 - uh just have like three so we don't
54:36 - overly overload this but right now there
54:38 - you go
54:39 - we've done the sidebar right so the
54:42 - sidebar is now done
54:43 - amazing stuff we're at 432 likes uh
54:46 - we're moving through this build pretty
54:48 - fast
54:48 - uh somebody says react hooks are
54:50 - confusing can you please explain it
54:51 - better
54:52 - i will explain it when we get to that
54:54 - point and yeah for sure dude
54:56 - so now we're going to create the chat
54:59 - component so this part right here on the
55:01 - on the right hand side so for the chat
55:03 - what we're going to do
55:04 - i'm going to go into imessage.js where
55:06 - we have the build going to get rid of my
55:08 - comment over here
55:09 - and i'm going to create the chat
55:11 - component
55:13 - so if i save it it goes ahead and it
55:15 - freaks out because we don't have chat so
55:17 - i'm going to go ahead and say chat.js
55:19 - do my neat little rfce trick
55:22 - go back and i'm gonna go to the top and
55:24 - say import
55:26 - uh chat.css
55:30 - go there create another file oh god
55:32 - create another file oh no no no
55:34 - no no don't do that go to source
55:37 - go back down here create another chat
55:40 - dot css
55:41 - there we go make sure you don't make a
55:43 - mistake like that okay um
55:45 - will all these videos be free on youtube
55:47 - forever
55:48 - yes dude they're going to be free
55:50 - forever right all of these videos are
55:52 - going to stay up on youtube free for you
55:54 - guys they're just pretty much to drop
55:55 - value for you guys so if you like that
55:58 - smash the thumbs up button that's it
56:00 - that's all we ask all right and that
56:02 - will help
56:03 - these three videos get out to as many
56:04 - people as possible so it can help
56:06 - our mission of 5 000 developers right
56:10 - um i appreciate you anupam uh so
56:13 - it says cersei really appreciate your
56:14 - work and god bless tmcp
56:16 - thank you dude so i'm going to go ahead
56:18 - and remove this comment and
56:21 - save it and then i'm going to import the
56:23 - chat component
56:24 - boom go to chat.js and here i'm going to
56:27 - go ahead and say class name
56:29 - uh chat okay now inside of here
56:33 - what we're gonna do is i'm gonna go
56:35 - ahead and
56:36 - where we have this right here um
56:40 - i'm gonna go ahead and do the following
56:43 - so
56:44 - we have inside of the chat we have the
56:47 - header
56:48 - right so the first thing we do is we
56:50 - have this header so the chat
56:52 - header and then we have the chat sort of
56:55 - body or the chat messages
56:57 - so this section right here and then we
56:58 - have the chat input it says three
57:00 - sections here
57:01 - okay so i'm gonna go ahead and you know
57:05 - how we do it we like to draft things
57:06 - out so i'm gonna go ahead and first do
57:09 - this i'm gonna say
57:09 - chat header then we have the chat
57:14 - messages and then we have
57:18 - the chat input okay
57:21 - uh awesome stuff thank you so much
57:23 - nathan for the positivity let's keep
57:25 - that energy higher we're holding on to
57:27 - 300 viewers this is insane
57:29 - uh victoria code says hi sonny you're
57:31 - one hell of an amazing teacher thanks
57:33 - for giving us such valuable content
57:35 - appreciate your victoria code and really
57:38 - nice to see you here thank you so much
57:40 - for the kind words so the top part chat
57:43 - header we're going to go ahead and use
57:44 - emmett so we're going to say chat
57:45 - underscore underscore header boom naming
57:47 - convention for the win
57:48 - and then you can see it pops up and then
57:50 - we're going to have a h4 inside
57:51 - and this is going to be responsible for
57:53 - this part right here
57:55 - how is the music making me making you
57:56 - tired dude this music should be
57:58 - awakening you
57:59 - up all right i mean if i if i up here
58:01 - right now that i think that i think i'll
58:04 - wake some people up you know but
58:07 - then we're gonna go ahead and do h4 and
58:10 - here i'm gonna say
58:11 - two and this would actually be the name
58:14 - of the room you're in so for example
58:15 - friends i have the youtube name it'll
58:17 - say to youtube but here i'm gonna say
58:19 - two
58:20 - and we're just gonna say channel name
58:21 - for now okay so these are all kind of
58:24 - placeholders for now
58:25 - all right um then i'm going to go
58:29 - ahead and render this on imessage so
58:32 - save it where is it oh yes you see right
58:35 - now it's underneath here
58:36 - so you guys can actually see us but it's
58:38 - actually popped underneath the reason
58:39 - why that's happened
58:41 - is because if we go to imessage we need
58:43 - to go ahead and go into our imessage.css
58:46 - and i need to do the following and say
58:47 - imessage display flex save it
58:50 - and boom that happens because it's flex
58:53 - so it's flex row
58:55 - um oh man oh man mohammed says sonny i
58:58 - can meet you in london i'm from
58:59 - tottenham hey
59:00 - let's go united kingdom crew muhammad
59:03 - shazad says hi sunny you're an amazing
59:05 - dude master and react appreciate the
59:06 - kind words thank you so much
59:08 - um so this is actually the music that
59:12 - i'm listening to right now is actually
59:13 - part of
59:14 - um i can't remember the
59:17 - comment for the service we use uh i will
59:19 - find that out though but i think it's
59:20 - it's basically the youtube copyright
59:22 - free music and that's the one that we
59:24 - use and i found a nice little
59:25 - rhythm that kind of goes with it um
59:28 - thank you so much adi meinstein goes hi
59:30 - it's my first time watching your stream
59:31 - in a while love brother keep smashing
59:33 - them thank you so much dude appreciate
59:34 - the positivity and guys we're almost at
59:37 - 500 likes
59:39 - this is insane let's keep going all
59:41 - right so imessage
59:43 - let's go ahead um
59:48 - oh dude this is for you amazing so i've
59:50 - been into reacting redox and often it
59:52 - seems like setting up redux to work is
59:53 - pretty annoying
59:54 - yes redux is annoying to set up go ahead
59:56 - and rewind this
59:57 - once this is finished i show you how to
59:59 - use create reactor with the redux
60:00 - template
60:01 - makes it so easy honestly it makes it so
60:03 - so easy
60:05 - um right so now we've got the channel
60:08 - name right here so i'm going to go back
60:09 - into
60:10 - the chat and then we're going to carry
60:11 - on so here we're also going to have a
60:13 - strong tag
60:15 - so strong tag the team are having a team
60:18 - meeting on a team lunch on
60:21 - zoom i feel left out right now damn it
60:24 - so we got details and then we can see
60:26 - here so two channel names
60:28 - details and then inside of here we're
60:30 - gonna go ahead and start this right now
60:32 - so i'm gonna get rid of this comment
60:34 - and i'm gonna also so where it says the
60:37 - channel name i'm gonna span
60:39 - a style here because i wanna style this
60:41 - up so i'm going to say span
60:43 - and i'm going to move channel name the
60:45 - contents of this
60:47 - to here and then i'm going to give this
60:49 - a class name
60:50 - so that i i love this comment dude
60:54 - sunkit dalvi says sunny is a treasure
60:56 - that we all must protect
60:58 - that's amazing thank you so much dude
61:01 - appreciate you
61:02 - uh so funny um
61:06 - all right nice
61:10 - um so now what we're going to do is
61:11 - we're going to go ahead and give this a
61:15 - chat underscore underscore name because
61:18 - it would be like the chat name channel
61:20 - name
61:20 - right so that looks good
61:24 - and i guess the next step naturally
61:27 - is to go ahead and start the top part so
61:30 - chat
61:31 - i've got a new mouse i'm getting used to
61:33 - it right and then we've got this i'm
61:35 - going to say
61:36 - for the chat what i want is i want to
61:39 - have display flex
61:42 - all right display flex direction is
61:44 - going to be column
61:45 - save it and flex
61:48 - is going to be 0.65 now why is it 0.65
61:51 - because remember
61:52 - this is 0.35 this is 0.65
61:56 - right because we want to take up the
61:57 - remainder of the room
62:00 - i'm going to say a height of 100 view
62:02 - height and i'm going to say background
62:03 - color of white
62:06 - all right save it boom right trust me
62:09 - it'll make sense in a bit why
62:10 - i set it to white now for the chat
62:12 - header what i'm going to do is i'm going
62:14 - to
62:14 - copy this paste and copy and paste this
62:17 - snippet in right here
62:18 - okay so saving this and you can see now
62:21 - it says having a 20 pixels display flex
62:23 - justify content space between
62:26 - bottom border and a background color
62:28 - right
62:29 - now let's debug it because something's
62:32 - gone
62:32 - wrong here so i don't actually know what
62:36 - went wrong here but you see we haven't
62:37 - actually got
62:39 - this right here yeah we haven't actually
62:41 - got this this
62:42 - like this should be filling out the the
62:44 - bit over here so
62:45 - something went wrong right so we're
62:47 - going to debug this
62:49 - scan to the debugging sort of mood right
62:51 - so i like to get a bit serious when we
62:53 - debug
62:54 - so now we're going to go ahead and find
62:57 - out why
62:58 - this why isn't this stretching all the
63:01 - way over here
63:02 - so i'm going to go ahead and find out
63:03 - why okay
63:05 - so it gets tense guys right because i'm
63:08 - not actually sure
63:09 - why that's not stretching over there so
63:10 - i'm going to refresh to make sure that
63:12 - i've
63:12 - exhausted everything okay and then what
63:15 - we're going to do is chat header
63:17 - right now should go ahead and let's see
63:23 - so the header right now it should be
63:26 - flex okay 0.65 save it oops no i don't
63:30 - want that what did i change
63:32 - all right so chat sits
63:36 - inside of imessage right imessage has
63:40 - sidebar and chat inside of it
63:41 - so let's open up our sidebar
63:45 - dot css and then here we've got 0.35
63:49 - right so display flex
63:52 - display flex okay
63:57 - what we could do is we could say at this
63:59 - point we could say width i don't really
64:00 - want to do width of 100
64:03 - i don't really like to do that approach
64:06 - right but
64:15 - why is that happening so we've got flex
64:17 - 0.65
64:18 - right it's even more stressful when
64:20 - you're live imagine how i feel guys
64:22 - i'm live and something don't work right
64:24 - i'm going to inspect it now so i'm going
64:26 - to show you guys how i do this
64:28 - so i'm going to go ahead pull this out
64:29 - because what we want
64:31 - is this where it takes up the entire
64:33 - space
64:34 - right and i'm not sure why it's not so
64:39 - maybe parent should be some people are
64:43 - saying should be 100 but you see the
64:44 - chat
64:45 - so this is actually flex 0.35 this is
64:49 - flex 0.65 the parent is display flex
64:55 - right but then the width of imessage ah
64:59 - no no width of imessage width of app.css
65:05 - oh
65:05 - i see why i see why all right
65:08 - so notice how app we've done display
65:10 - flex
65:12 - ah there it is all right i'm gonna move
65:16 - myself by the way
65:17 - app there it is guys that is why
65:21 - so we found the issue so you see that i
65:24 - didn't need display flex on the app
65:26 - it was because i then nested it inside
65:28 - of imessage where we had display flex so
65:30 - this was stopping me from using all of
65:31 - the space so we did it guys we fixed the
65:34 - bug
65:34 - hey go ahead and hit the thumbs up
65:37 - button if that was some fun
65:38 - i thought that was pretty cool honestly
65:39 - that was actually something unplanned
65:41 - for i didn't realize that was gonna
65:42 - happen but
65:43 - we did it so let's carry on right uh
65:46 - i'm gonna go ahead and fix that now so
65:50 - go back to our code go back to app.css
65:53 - i'm going to get rid of this we don't
65:55 - need this one right
65:56 - boom oh somebody said the air horn dude
65:59 - you're right man i haven't
66:00 - done the air horn in a while let's go
66:06 - why is that so quiet all right let me go
66:08 - ahead and let me let me do it one more
66:09 - time right
66:10 - three two one and
66:15 - that that that blew my head off but
66:18 - we're back all right uh carrying on
66:22 - right so honestly that was actually
66:26 - something pretty cool because that's not
66:28 - like a real life example of where i ran
66:30 - into a debugging issue and we kind of
66:32 - went through it and solved it together
66:33 - so
66:34 - hope you guys enjoyed that we're 15
66:36 - likes away from 500 uh
66:37 - 500 likes so smash the thumbs up button
66:39 - if you enjoyed that live debugging
66:41 - session
66:42 - a bit of fun as well with the music okay
66:44 - now
66:46 - back into coding right so now
66:49 - we have that done i'm going to go ahead
66:51 - and hide this
66:54 - him and she said yo that horn sound i
66:57 - know dude that woke me up
66:58 - so yeah i want my neighbors up right um
67:01 - so we've got that looking pretty good
67:03 - right now we're going to carry on
67:04 - styling it out so here i'm going to say
67:07 - we're inside of chat.css so right now
67:10 - i'm going to go ahead and start the chat
67:12 - header so i'm going to say chat header
67:15 - i'm going to target the h4 element
67:17 - inside so if we go into my chat you'll
67:18 - see i've got the h4 here
67:20 - so i'm going to go ahead and target the
67:21 - h4 and i'm going to say font weight of
67:23 - 500 so we want to reduce the weight
67:25 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
67:27 - color of gray
67:29 - boom right and then
67:33 - you can see it change the color a bit
67:34 - right but we spanned in this chat name
67:36 - right so chat name we're actually gonna
67:39 - go ahead and add a bit of styling to
67:41 - ourselves
67:41 - and we're gonna make this one um so if i
67:44 - go here and i say chat name
67:46 - and i say color black
67:47 - [Music]
67:49 - and now you should see the channel name
67:51 - is actually black right
67:53 - um you and the rest of the team are the
67:56 - best also what i need to know
67:58 - to start react just start dude honestly
68:00 - just start like learn the basics on the
68:02 - fly you can go ahead and do that
68:04 - um so yeah just go ahead and start um
68:08 - okay
68:10 - oh somebody says why do you use pixels
68:12 - versus ram
68:13 - very good question actually we'll touch
68:15 - on a different video but we should
68:17 - rem is a good unit to use actually but
68:19 - we're going to go ahead and do that
68:20 - another video okay so now we're going to
68:23 - go and build the
68:25 - um we're going to build the chat
68:28 - messages
68:29 - section right so i'm going to ign i'm
68:31 - actually going to leave this bit right
68:32 - here the middle section so where we
68:34 - actually have the messages i'm going to
68:35 - leave that to after
68:37 - but right now i'm going to build the
68:38 - input section at the bottom okay
68:40 - so i'm going to move myself a little bit
68:42 - and we're going to have the input
68:44 - section
68:45 - uh yeah this is a good point stop
68:47 - repeating and i'm
68:48 - i'm literally going to ignore you i can
68:50 - see when people constantly keep copying
68:51 - and pasting stuff right
68:53 - now i can see somebody spamming the chat
68:55 - you're getting blocked dude
68:56 - like don't do that stuff right
69:00 - uh yeah you're blocked so yeah sorry
69:03 - about that but
69:04 - you know you're asking for it when you
69:06 - when you play around like that so
69:07 - don't go ahead and do that because we
69:10 - want everyone to
69:11 - have you know we want everyone to to
69:14 - sort of be
69:15 - to get value from this uh as opposed to
69:18 - you know just messing around also
69:20 - elizabeth you just earned moderator
69:22 - rights
69:22 - so feel free to block people um
69:25 - right so now we're gonna go ahead and
69:27 - for the chat input
69:29 - i'm gonna first do chat input and then
69:31 - i'm gonna say div
69:32 - chat underscore underscore um
69:36 - [Music]
69:37 - input right and then here i'm going to
69:40 - have a form
69:42 - because we like to have the submit
69:43 - functionality where you basically hit
69:45 - the enter key
69:46 - inside the input field i'm going to have
69:47 - an input field and i'm going to have a
69:49 - button
69:50 - which says send message now i will be
69:52 - hiding this button but for now it
69:54 - doesn't matter
69:55 - okay and the goal is we're going to try
69:56 - and change this to look like this thing
69:58 - down here
69:59 - all right so it's going to eventually
70:00 - look like this very nice uh
70:02 - user input form at the bottom so this
70:04 - imessage
70:05 - where it says this bottom thing right
70:07 - here we're gonna have that looking very
70:08 - nice at the end
70:11 - so
70:14 - so somebody says why is it free and we
70:16 - have paid for pwj
70:18 - so this is actually a this is a coach
70:19 - this is not a coaching call guys and
70:21 - also
70:22 - um pwj has a ton more than what we offer
70:25 - on youtube so if you think youtube is
70:27 - good
70:28 - we have all the modules inside the
70:30 - profile of javascript we have coaching
70:31 - calls we have one-to-one access we have
70:32 - a community of amazing people inside
70:35 - there
70:35 - everything that is available inside the
70:37 - course in profit javascript is not
70:39 - available here
70:40 - right so uh yeah right so
70:44 - now what we're gonna do is have um
70:48 - we're gonna change the input placeholder
70:51 - to say imessage
70:54 - save it and now you should see it say
70:56 - imessage inside
70:57 - the button we're going to go ahead and
70:59 - fire off a function
71:01 - called send message because the whole
71:03 - point is that when we click that
71:05 - it should send a message okay so we
71:07 - haven't written this function yet so i'm
71:08 - going to write that in a sec
71:11 - so i'm going to go up here and i'm going
71:12 - to say const
71:14 - send message takes an event
71:19 - and it fires off an arrow function then
71:20 - we're going to do e dot prevent default
71:22 - because if i don't do this right i'll
71:23 - show you what happens
71:24 - so if i type in hit enter see it refresh
71:26 - so watch this bit at the top
71:29 - boom boom boom enter and it just
71:31 - disappears right
71:32 - so that's going to be like we don't want
71:35 - to do that right we don't want to have
71:36 - that
71:37 - hey logan's in the house what's up logan
71:39 - good to see you dude
71:41 - uh logan's absolutely killing it and he
71:43 - we work with him daily so
71:46 - good awesome guy he's inside a prophet
71:47 - javascript as well
71:49 - um right so
71:52 - we're actually gonna go ahead and create
71:53 - the send message but we don't want that
71:55 - refresh right
71:56 - we're going to do e dot prevent default
72:00 - thank you so much lloyd for the kind
72:01 - words prevent default oh god whatever
72:03 - we're done here prevent
72:04 - default like this go back save it
72:08 - and then down here basically this is
72:10 - where we do all the sort of firebase
72:11 - magic so this is going to be firebase
72:12 - magic
72:13 - in a bit and yeah now
72:17 - we want to kind of keep track of when
72:19 - i'm typing in
72:20 - right so as i'm typing in here i want to
72:22 - keep track of what's got what's
72:24 - sort of like i'm going to keep track of
72:26 - this input inside of state
72:28 - so in order to do that what i'm going to
72:30 - do
72:31 - is um i'm going to go ahead and do
72:34 - the following so i'm going to go ahead
72:35 - and say const i'm going to use
72:37 - a this the use state hooks i'm going to
72:40 - introduce a piece of state
72:41 - and thank you ankit he goes hey you are
72:44 - doing a great job man thank you thank
72:45 - you appreciate that dude
72:47 - um i'm going to create a piece of state
72:49 - called input and i'm going to say
72:50 - set input and um
72:53 - guys don't please please please don't
72:56 - i'm going to just
72:58 - you're getting blocked you're getting
72:59 - blocked like it really annoys me when i
73:01 - see stuff like that right
73:02 - um go ahead and now we're going to go
73:05 - and do this input set input
73:09 - and i'm going to equals use state right
73:12 - i'm going to import it from react while
73:14 - right so you see we import it at the top
73:16 - and and this is going to initially be
73:19 - an empty string right now to map it to
73:22 - the input field i'm going to say value
73:24 - equals input and then i'm going to say
73:28 - on change equals
73:31 - e set input
73:34 - and it's going to be e dot target dot
73:36 - value
73:38 - right um
73:42 - font size really needs to increase okay
73:44 - so we can make it a bit bigger
73:46 - i mean guys yeah i mean i like i do make
73:48 - it this way but like when we're doing
73:50 - huge builds i don't like it to be
73:51 - so in your face but that's pretty good i
73:53 - think okay
73:58 - um okay
74:01 - next we're gonna go ahead and have
74:05 - also guys bear in mind like imagine
74:06 - you're doing a build and then you're
74:08 - doing like
74:09 - the checking the comments and you're
74:10 - doing all this other stuff it's a lot to
74:12 - take in you know it's a lot to process
74:13 - and do that
74:14 - um lloyd says sunny man dude you
74:17 - just give the but you're just you just
74:19 - give the best of the react appreciate it
74:20 - man
74:21 - appreciate you watching lloyd thank you
74:22 - so much um logan says i got my second pc
74:25 - and up and running with sen os7 running
74:27 - ssh is up on boots so i can remote into
74:29 - it with vs code on windows ah
74:31 - that's jacked man nice because uh
74:34 - kind of awesome i have real linux in my
74:37 - vs code camera that's dope man
74:38 - i like that that's awesome stuff dude
74:43 - all right so what we're going to do next
74:47 - is
74:47 - i'm going to have the send message over
74:49 - here so
74:51 - once with that i'm going to go ahead and
74:54 - say
74:58 - i want to basically after i send the
74:59 - message i'm going to set the input to be
75:01 - an empty string so
75:03 - now if we see if i go ahead and type
75:05 - something in hit enter
75:06 - see it it actually clears out the
75:08 - contents right so that's a good thing
75:10 - so what i'm going to do now
75:14 - is actually go ahead and have this this
75:17 - halfway i'm going to style this input
75:19 - field so it looks like the
75:20 - beautiful finished input field down here
75:22 - that we see at the bottom okay
75:24 - so in order to do that i'm going to go
75:26 - ahead and also
75:27 - please stop asking the same question
75:29 - something any particular reason for
75:30 - using search icon rather than search
75:32 - no dude uh it was just a case of it was
75:35 - the one that i got i found and it worked
75:37 - for me
75:37 - okay so here i'm going to go ahead
75:40 - and do chat dots here also guys don't
75:43 - focus on that stuff like you should be
75:45 - looking at the build
75:46 - not that stuff like honestly if you're
75:48 - focusing on what my import was as
75:50 - opposed to like what the actual
75:51 - functionality is i'm doing
75:53 - you like you know pay attention to the
75:55 - right areas right that's what you need
75:57 - to kind of pay attention to correct
75:58 - areas
76:00 - so i'm going to open up my chat.css
76:03 - and here i'm going to go ahead and say
76:04 - dot chat input
76:07 - right and i'm going to say display flex
76:11 - and i'm going to go ahead and say align
76:13 - item center
76:16 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
76:17 - padding 10 pixels oh god
76:20 - padding 10 pixels 20 pixels which means
76:24 - 10 pixels left and right uh 20 px
76:26 - 10 pixels top and bottom um and 20
76:29 - pixels left and right okay
76:30 - then i'm going to say border top one
76:31 - pixel solid light gray boom
76:34 - save that and i'm going to say
76:36 - background color white
76:39 - nice oh no gray sorry i want to be gray
76:42 - okay
76:43 - then what i'm going to say is i'm going
76:44 - to target the form and i'm going to give
76:46 - it a
76:46 - flex of one right because i want the
76:49 - form to take up the most input at the
76:51 - most space
76:52 - i'm going to say flex one and that will
76:54 - actually go ahead and it'll push it
76:56 - as far as it can be pushed and what we
76:58 - need to then do is say
76:59 - target the form and then the input
77:03 - inside the form
77:04 - get a width of 98 outline width of zero
77:08 - border one pixel light green
77:11 - border radius 999 so it gives it a
77:13 - rounded effect and padding and fiber as
77:14 - soon as i save this watch this
77:16 - boom looks nice right and then for the
77:20 - button
77:21 - i'm gonna go ahead and target the button
77:23 - so inside the form inside the button do
77:26 - display none because we don't actually
77:27 - want the button there so now if i type
77:28 - in
77:29 - enter we get a nice sort of functional
77:33 - working input tool okay
77:36 - so that's really really good to show the
77:38 - size says you're great at multitasking
77:40 - great work man honestly dude you get
77:41 - really good at it thank you for
77:43 - noticing that but yeah like i've got a
77:45 - stream deck as well so i can basically
77:46 - go like this any second i can go ahead
77:48 - and just do
77:48 - like fun stuff like this i could say oh
77:52 - things are gonna get real you know like
77:53 - you can do all this kind of fun stuff
77:55 - um but there's like you get really good
77:57 - i'm doing things with my left hand
77:58 - things with my right hand it's crazy but
77:59 - yeah
78:00 - back to the boat um
78:04 - binny binny says you give me hope that i
78:06 - could become a programmer
78:07 - thank you that's awesome man or girl
78:09 - thank you so much for that
78:13 - code codekid says man you are epic
78:16 - guys your energy is insane today really
78:18 - really thank you and also with that said
78:20 - we just broke over 500 likes on the
78:23 - this video amazing stuff guys thank you
78:26 - all
78:26 - for for watching and i really do
78:28 - appreciate and love each and every one
78:30 - of you
78:32 - right um nice
78:36 - i'm gonna go ahead and switch it back to
78:38 - this music i prefer this music
78:39 - right so now back to chat.js i'm gonna
78:42 - then
78:43 - actually next to so outside this form
78:47 - going back to chat.js outside this form
78:49 - we're gonna have a
78:50 - mic button okay so if you notice at the
78:52 - bottom of our build we have this little
78:54 - mic
78:54 - right so i'm going to go ahead and add
78:56 - that in but it's also an icon button
78:58 - which means remember i showed you that
78:59 - neat little trick earlier so it makes it
79:00 - a nice clickable button
79:02 - right um then what i'm going to do
79:05 - is i'm going to go ahead and first pop
79:07 - this in so i'm going to say
79:09 - boom i'm going to give it a class name
79:11 - so i can target it easier i'm going to
79:12 - say chat under squad underscore mic
79:15 - and i'm going to do this and now outside
79:18 - this i'm going to say
79:19 - icon button right and then everything
79:23 - inside the here should be mic
79:24 - like this right now for the icon button
79:26 - i'm going to import it
79:27 - same for this i'm going to import this
79:29 - but this one i need to actually import
79:30 - the top
79:31 - so i'm going to go up to the top and i'm
79:33 - going to go ahead and pop it in there
79:35 - save it boom uh so shank says this is
79:38 - the best one keep doing this bro
79:40 - nice thank you um
79:43 - yeah khalid says we're pumped nice
79:46 - that's
79:46 - it man keep this energy high there you
79:49 - go guys look at that we have that
79:51 - nice looking logo on the right okay
79:53 - that's looking good
79:54 - right now i'm going to show you a really
79:56 - neat little trick if you build things in
79:57 - the correct way actually
79:59 - implementing the functionality isn't
80:00 - that bad right
80:02 - so we have the chat messages i'm going
80:04 - to get rid of the
80:05 - comment here so now i'm going to build
80:06 - out the chat underscore messages
80:09 - yeah and inside of here we're just going
80:11 - to have a bunch of messages so like
80:12 - imagine this just says
80:14 - uh h2 of like i am
80:17 - a message save it
80:21 - and then you see it's like i have a
80:23 - message i'm gonna add a bunch of these
80:24 - in right
80:26 - i want this one to always take up this
80:28 - middle space so this should always be
80:29 - pushed to the bottom
80:30 - in order to do that what i do is i go
80:31 - into my chat.css
80:33 - and i go ahead and target chat messages
80:36 - and i just say flex1
80:37 - because the flex direction of this
80:38 - entire parent is column which means it
80:41 - should
80:42 - push to say use up as much room as
80:44 - possible
80:45 - and we get that functionality so that
80:47 - looks really really good
80:49 - um action says you look a bit burnt out
80:53 - uh videos are super amazing love the
80:55 - effort you are putting in
80:56 - uh appreciate the the consideration dude
80:59 - i'm all good though i'm all good thank
81:00 - you so much for asking
81:02 - um right so
81:05 - now what i'm gonna do is go back to
81:07 - chad.js
81:08 - and i am going to
81:12 - this is the next bit so where do we
81:13 - focus our attention to
81:15 - now let's go ahead and create the uh
81:18 - login
81:19 - section right now okay so login section
81:21 - for now so let's go back to our app.js
81:25 - so here i'm going to say app.js i'm
81:27 - going to go back here so
81:29 - what i'm going to say is i'm going to
81:30 - use redux here so
81:32 - redux i'm not going to actually go
81:34 - through fully of what redux
81:35 - does because yesterday's build we
81:37 - extensively went over some of the redux
81:38 - stuff
81:39 - so you can go ahead and watch that one
81:41 - and then today's one but i'm going to go
81:42 - ahead and break it down in a nice
81:44 - way for you guys so it's easy to
81:45 - understand so
81:47 - i'm going to go into features counter
81:49 - slice i'm going to rename counter slice
81:51 - so everything that says counter
81:53 - i'm going to call this the user slice
81:54 - okay
81:56 - so user now the initial state of the
81:59 - user slice is going to be user
82:01 - and then here i don't need any of this
82:03 - stuff i just want to
82:05 - go ahead and get rid of all these
82:06 - comments i'm simplifying my code right
82:07 - now
82:08 - and here i'm gonna have actually no let
82:10 - me get keep one of these
82:11 - i'll show you why i'm gonna go ahead and
82:14 - change this one to logout
82:16 - this one to login and then i'm gonna go
82:19 - ahead and get rid of this
82:21 - and this should be state.user
82:24 - equals and then we'll get we'll change
82:27 - this in a sec
82:28 - and then when we log in it's state and
82:30 - it passes an action
82:32 - just follow this refactoring step and it
82:34 - will make a lot of sense okay
82:36 - um and then this will be log out get rid
82:39 - of this
82:40 - because we export it so we can use it
82:41 - outside i'm going to get rid of all this
82:42 - crap
82:44 - i'm going to get rid of all of this i'm
82:47 - going to say select this is my selectors
82:49 - here so this is how i access my state
82:51 - afterwards
82:54 - and then yeah that's how we get
82:55 - everything up and running okay so with
82:57 - that done
82:58 - i'm going to go ahead and go back to app
83:00 - store.js
83:01 - i'm going to re change everything here
83:03 - so this will go ahead i'm going to
83:05 - change
83:06 - this over here to user reducer
83:10 - right and then it's going to freak out
83:12 - because we haven't got that file okay so
83:13 - i'm going to go back here
83:15 - and i'm going to go down to counter
83:17 - slice rename
83:19 - i'm going to change this to become user
83:21 - slice
83:22 - save it boom now we have it see
83:24 - everything's working
83:25 - now to test this works i'm going to open
83:27 - up my dev tool so i'm going to inspect
83:29 - go to redux and we should see if i go to
83:33 - the state we now have a user so i'm
83:35 - going to make this a bit more visible
83:36 - for you guys
83:37 - but i know my face is in the way so
83:40 - we've got the user where the user is
83:41 - zero right now so it's perfect
83:43 - okay so the user we don't actually want
83:44 - to be zero i'll go ahead and show you
83:46 - why
83:47 - how we fix that in a sec but now what we
83:49 - do is we go here and the user is not
83:51 - going to be
83:51 - zero by default the user is no okay
83:55 - then what we're going to do is this is
83:57 - just going to be action.payload and this
83:59 - will make sense afterwards
84:01 - and this when we log out the user gets
84:03 - reset to no
84:04 - that's what we do right now what we're
84:07 - going to do
84:08 - is i'm going to go ahead and quickly
84:09 - give you a quick rundown so this is a
84:11 - quick
84:11 - illustration of what we've done here so
84:13 - this build is using something called
84:14 - redux
84:15 - right now what is redux redux is
84:17 - essentially imagine we have a bunch of
84:19 - components inside of our app so this is
84:21 - a component called app.js right
84:23 - and then everything else is kind of
84:25 - rendered underneath it right so we have
84:27 - like the chat component the header
84:28 - component the sidebar component
84:30 - all of these things right we have chat
84:31 - we have sidebar we have header i mean
84:34 - everything's actually inside of imessage
84:35 - but you know you get the point
84:37 - and then we have message and so forth
84:38 - now imagine we have all these things
84:40 - right
84:41 - so everything gets rendered here
84:44 - and then you also have more components
84:46 - underneath here right so you can have
84:48 - different things being rendered off
84:50 - of these components and and vice versa
84:52 - right
84:53 - now imagine we had a login component
84:56 - over here
84:57 - right now imagine we had when we do the
84:59 - login we get a user object
85:01 - right what if i want to use the the user
85:04 - object
85:05 - over here so what if i want to use the
85:07 - user object over here
85:10 - right if i want to use the user object
85:12 - over here how the hell do i get from
85:15 - here here sorry all the way
85:18 - over here right it's kind of annoying i
85:20 - kind of have to do this long journey
85:22 - of somehow getting my so maybe i
85:25 - initialize the user
85:26 - over here and i pass the setter down
85:27 - there and then i have to do something
85:29 - called prop drilling
85:30 - pass it to this component and then pass
85:32 - it to this one and if i want it over
85:33 - here i need to pass it down to this one
85:35 - and
85:35 - you can already see this is getting
85:36 - super messy right we don't want to do
85:38 - any of this
85:39 - so what we can do is we can introduce
85:41 - something called a data layer or
85:43 - something like redux right so redux kind
85:45 - of essentially surrounds the app
85:46 - right so this is essentially redux and
85:49 - now redux is essentially like an onion
85:50 - so imagine like an onion so this is
85:52 - onion surrounding our app now an onion
85:54 - has different slices inside of it
85:56 - now each slice inside of redux resembles
85:58 - different
86:00 - contexts or like different things inside
86:02 - of our app so we have a user slice
86:04 - and this is going to be responsible for
86:05 - all of the user information then we have
86:07 - something like an app slice
86:09 - this is going to be all the generic
86:10 - information about the app and we can
86:12 - have something like a basket slice
86:14 - and this would basically be uh so i'm
86:16 - just gonna say basket slice
86:17 - right and this would essentially be all
86:19 - of the things inside of the basket
86:21 - so you see and these all belong inside
86:23 - of the layers of the onions right
86:26 - and then what we can do now is when we
86:27 - get a login uh
86:29 - when we do get the user at this side
86:31 - what we can do is we can actually push
86:32 - the user into the data layer
86:34 - so inside of this and then anywhere
86:36 - inside the app so if i want the user
86:38 - uh over here what i can do is i can just
86:41 - grab the user
86:42 - so the user is part of the data layer i
86:44 - can grab the user and just use them in
86:46 - this component
86:46 - and if i need to use the user over here
86:49 - and go ahead and grab the user out of
86:50 - the data layer
86:51 - here so you see once we have it we don't
86:53 - need to pass props around and things
86:55 - like that we can just kind of
86:57 - push things into the data layer by
86:58 - dispatching actions like the login
87:00 - action to get the user into the data
87:01 - layer
87:02 - and then we can pull out the user
87:03 - wherever we want and in order to do this
87:05 - we use something called a selector so in
87:07 - this case it would be like select user
87:10 - okay so i hope that makes a bit more
87:12 - sense if it doesn't
87:14 - feel free to go ahead and check out
87:16 - yesterday's build and that's going to
87:18 - help you guys
87:19 - uh quite a lot nice i saw somebody says
87:22 - onion incoming
87:23 - nice i love how you guys know what's
87:25 - going now
87:26 - um so that's going to help you guys
87:28 - understand things a little bit more okay
87:31 - ali says you guys rock makes it easy to
87:33 - understand really appreciate it
87:36 - all right so with that done
87:39 - and said i'm going to go ahead and
87:41 - create this
87:42 - right here so we've done that now um the
87:45 - next thing is i'm also going to go ahead
87:47 - and prepare
87:48 - something as well so somebody says so
87:50 - what is the disadvantage
87:52 - disadvantages of using the context api
87:54 - at this point
87:55 - so the disadvantages are so it's not
87:57 - this much it's more like redux is more
87:59 - powerful so
88:00 - we for one we have these beautiful redux
88:02 - devtools
88:03 - so over here we have nice little redux
88:05 - devtools where
88:06 - and trust me this comes in very very
88:08 - handy later on so
88:10 - we're going to be using that today also
88:12 - you split your pieces of state
88:14 - into different like uh areas so for
88:17 - example the basket slice the user slice
88:19 - the app slice and things like that
88:21 - so it's a lot more um oh this is a good
88:24 - question actually so logan says it says
88:26 - redux like an object that has pointers
88:28 - from app.js and all its children so
88:30 - think of it as like global
88:32 - state so as an easier way of thinking it
88:35 - right
88:35 - so global state and then all the
88:37 - children beneath app.js
88:39 - or pretty much inside of your app have
88:42 - access to that global state
88:43 - think of it that way you dispatch an
88:45 - action to go ahead and manipulate that
88:47 - global state
88:48 - and then you use selectors to pull from
88:50 - that global state right
88:52 - so in other words always accessible yes
88:54 - pretty much exactly so we have like
88:56 - things like the user is always
88:57 - accessible from any component inside of
88:59 - the app
89:00 - um so i think that's going to help
89:03 - everyone out
89:04 - now to your places last time your video
89:05 - helped me a lot thanks
89:07 - awesome stuff jennifer says hey sonny oh

90:27 - like dragon atom i still did
90:30 - amazing stuff um
90:35 - all right logan interesting i love like
90:36 - to see a partially compiled reactor with
90:38 - redux to see how it's actually using
90:39 - redux
90:40 - i'm actually going to show you today so
90:41 - stick around logan um and i'm going to
90:43 - show you when we actually dispatch
90:45 - actions how it modifies
90:47 - the state inside of the app um and it's
90:49 - going to be pretty cool
90:50 - david atta says suddenly you get my job
90:53 - count before december ends
90:56 - ah so i'm talking about dude let's do it
90:58 - david
91:00 - um um okay this is awesome
91:04 - future code says there there's one sure
91:06 - thing consistent and keep building these
91:07 - clones you will get a job
91:09 - many of us are proof no matter what your
91:11 - background or level is it's just a
91:12 - matter of time
91:14 - elizabeth is somebody i do one-on-one
91:15 - coaching with uh future code
91:17 - she literally landed a job and now she's
91:20 - doing coaching with me still to kind of
91:22 - keep her skills up today and up to sort
91:24 - of scratch

91:34 - it makes me
91:34 - so happy to go ahead and hear that
91:39 - oh man i think i talk like 20 000 words
91:43 - a minute when i'm ready
91:44 - alive okay so uh ashfaq says you're
91:48 - my inspiration and motivation to move to
91:50 - web development amazing dude thank you
91:52 - so much
91:52 - blackout says thank you appreciate you
91:54 - dude um
91:56 - oh another job holy crap dude
91:59 - he says sonny i got a job at local

92:14 - drop him some love that's amazing to see
92:15 - that right
92:17 - we've got kansas in the house um
92:20 - he goes you're my coding inspiration i'm
92:21 - from kansas and we love you dude
92:23 - appreciate that dude
92:24 - amazing stuff right back to the build so
92:27 - here we have i am a message right
92:29 - uh so what we're gonna do is actually go
92:31 - ahead and prepare
92:32 - the login flow so firstly i need to go
92:34 - ahead and set up firebase so i'm gonna
92:36 - go to firebase.google.com
92:38 - uh make sure all you need is a google
92:39 - account i'm going to go to the console
92:41 - over here i'm going to click on add
92:43 - project then i'm going to go ahead and
92:45 - say
92:46 - imessage clone right
92:49 - when i say i message clone on youtube
92:52 - i'm going to enable google analytics you
92:53 - don't need to enable google analytics
92:54 - but you can if you want
92:56 - i'm going to go ahead and create the
92:57 - project all right now
93:00 - nikhil says sunny how can i do mentoring
93:02 - coaching with you
93:03 - just drop me a dm on my instagram at
93:06 - ssssanga
93:07 - so the one you can see on the screen uh
93:10 - or here it might be easier to see
93:11 - so you can see it over there go ahead
93:13 - follow me send me a dm just saying
93:15 - one-on-one coaching and pretty much we
93:16 - can have a conversation dude
93:18 - um and yeah and also send me an email as
93:21 - well as
93:22 - well uh to get the best chance of
93:23 - getting through to me but yeah that'll
93:25 - be awesome
93:26 - um nice
93:29 - all right so clicking on continue
93:33 - right so next what we're gonna do we're
93:34 - going to click this little web button
93:36 - over here
93:37 - and here i'm going to say imessage clone
93:40 - youtube set up firebase hosting boom
93:43 - register the app
93:44 - right okay so you drop to dm nice
93:47 - i get hundreds of dm so i'll go ahead
93:49 - and search through that um
93:50 - maybe send me another one and i can
93:52 - pretty much see that uh we're gonna
93:54 - click next
93:55 - and continues to the console nice people
93:58 - say why firebase because firebase has a
93:59 - real-time database so we're gonna
94:01 - use cloud firestore which is like the
94:03 - nosql real-time database so powerful
94:05 - version
94:06 - it also has authentication it has a
94:09 - bunch of stuff you are trending number
94:10 - four for imessage
94:11 - damn let's go man trending on youtube so
94:15 - that's insane
94:16 - all right so we're gonna go to
94:17 - authentication over here on the left
94:19 - and the first thing we're gonna do is
94:21 - click sign in method what's up
94:22 - alexandros could see you did
94:24 - uh always recognize the face so we're
94:26 - gonna go to google
94:28 - i'm gonna click enable okay i need to
94:31 - enable an email
94:32 - there we go click save okay so that's
94:34 - done
94:35 - and then i'm going to go to this little
94:36 - cog at the top project settings
94:38 - i'm going to go down to config and click
94:41 - the copy button
94:42 - okay i'm going to head back over to my
94:44 - code now and what i want to do is create
94:46 - a firebase.js file so firebase.js
94:51 - right and here i'm going to pull up my
94:53 - terminal i'm going to do mpmi
94:56 - firebase i need to install firebase into
94:58 - my project
95:00 - now while that's doing i'm going to
95:01 - paste
95:03 - and we've got the firebase config then
95:06 - i'm going to say
95:06 - import firebase from firebase because we
95:09 - just
95:10 - we're literally installing it down below
95:12 - as you can see down here
95:13 - and while that's happening guys i can go
95:14 - ahead and set up the next thing so i can
95:16 - go ahead and say const firebase app
95:18 - equals firebase dot initialize app with
95:21 - that config so this is basically going
95:22 - to use this like a key
95:24 - to get into the uh into our firebase
95:27 - end right so um nice he goes man you
95:30 - guys have energy doing all these
95:31 - tutorials yeah man the energy is high
95:34 - today let's go
95:35 - um also here thank you so much raj um he
95:37 - says superb video appreciate you
95:39 - watching dude
95:40 - thank you so much logan very good point
95:43 - here he says firebase is also classified
95:44 - as a back end as a service
95:46 - so it's cutting down the work of the
95:47 - build considerably a hundred billion
95:49 - percent i couldn't agree with that more
95:51 - really nice way of doing it um
95:54 - explaining it uh somebody says firebase
95:55 - is so expensive no dude
95:57 - firebase is free right so
96:01 - and also google if you ever watch this
96:02 - video sponsor us you know
96:04 - guess guess in with the good rates um so
96:07 - then what i'm going to do is i'm going
96:08 - to say
96:08 - constdb equals firebaseapp.firestore
96:12 - so that will go ahead and do it hey if
96:15 - uh
96:15 - khalid says hey i'll dm you the off
96:17 - letter i got keep an eye out for my
96:18 - insta at the real
96:19 - skypes skies nice dude go ahead and send
96:22 - that to me and i'll be awesome
96:24 - right um right
96:28 - uh okay and somebody this is a good
96:30 - point nikhil says i feel like we need
96:31 - journey of react
96:32 - of papa react and how he reached level
96:35 - and from what all resources
96:37 - if you guys want to see that i might
96:38 - actually start shooting some content on
96:39 - my youtube channel
96:41 - which goes behind kind of getting to
96:43 - know me a bit more
96:44 - i guess getting to know me my story that
96:46 - sort of stuff if you guys want to see
96:48 - that
96:48 - then let me know and i'll start shooting
96:50 - more content on my personal account
96:52 - and you know it's just kind of fun you

97:04 - sanga on youtube go ahead and check it
97:06 - out
97:07 - um right so with that said now what i'm
97:10 - going to do is i'm also going to say
97:11 - const auth
97:12 - equals firebase.auth right so this is
97:15 - all prepared preparation so this is
97:16 - already done
97:18 - um nice so many people are saying
97:21 - damn yes honestly start a vlogging
97:23 - channel we would love to know more about
97:24 - you
97:25 - um yeah okay i heard you did
97:29 - um loads of people saying it do it it's
97:30 - cool if you've subscribed to me then
97:32 - keep an eye out okay
97:34 - logan says yeah bro you should just vlog
97:36 - on your days out yeah you know i should

97:38 - doing fun stuff going out and about so
97:40 - i think that'll be awesome uh yeah 100
97:44 - um you guys killed my depression damn
97:47 - love that
97:48 - um you also made me passionate about
97:50 - programming love your content that's
97:51 - amazing
97:52 - and i'm so glad to hear that we helped
97:54 - you out on that journey right
97:56 - the next thing we want to do guys is go
97:58 - ahead and go down here and say
98:00 - cons provider equals new firebase.google
98:02 - author provider so this is like where
98:04 - the magic happens
98:05 - to go ahead and connect it um to
98:08 - somebody says i love you continue thank
98:10 - you so much
98:12 - we're going to go ahead and export the
98:15 - two things so we're
98:16 - going to export um something can you
98:19 - mention these
98:20 - firebase imports exports so they are
98:22 - mentioned that are the methods given by
98:23 - 5s yeah
98:24 - so all of these imports right here so
98:26 - you see like this
98:28 - whereas firebase this is all from
98:30 - firebase it's firebase dot initializing
98:32 - the app firebase app
98:33 - this is using this what we just
98:34 - initialized to go ahead
98:36 - and um get grab the database grab the
98:40 - authentication and then we pretty much
98:41 - go ahead and get our authentication
98:44 - provider
98:45 - right so
98:49 - with this bit done now what we're going
98:50 - to do is i'm going to export
98:53 - the authentication and the provider as
98:55 - something called a
98:56 - explicit uh export and then we'll undo
98:59 - this as our default
99:01 - export so export default
99:04 - db and the reason why i like to do the
99:06 - default db is because we use the db a
99:08 - bit more
99:08 - so i think it's always nice to kind of
99:10 - have the db as your default okay
99:13 - um firebase must just be one monstrous
99:15 - class
99:16 - so obviously even they kind of once it's
99:19 - done and the hard work's done they kind
99:21 - of like compile it into a very
99:23 - nice minified piece of code and i think
99:25 - that's going to be
99:26 - and that's what you end up looking at
99:30 - so if i go ahead and i'll show you
99:32 - actually so if i go ahead and
99:34 - click over onto firebase for example and
99:36 - click into you see like you get the
99:38 - actual typescript files
99:40 - you can see this is their kind of code
99:42 - behind the screen so this is their type
99:43 - definitions
99:44 - um so it doesn't actually show you the
99:46 - code as such because the code is going
99:48 - to be inside of here
99:49 - so you see this is what they did to
99:51 - their code it's all minified
99:53 - um but yeah you can see but then they
99:55 - give you type definitions and that's
99:56 - what that's what gives
99:58 - vs code the ability to go ahead and
100:00 - check out um
100:02 - what is like available when you do when
100:04 - you press like
100:05 - dot and things like that okay so we've
100:07 - set up firebase that's all good now we
100:09 - go back to our chat
100:10 - and what i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna
100:12 - go ahead and do the login flow
100:14 - okay so login flow is inside of app.js
100:18 - so here
100:19 - right so we're gonna firstly create a
100:22 - we've already got a user here we've got
100:23 - the select user so what i can do is i
100:26 - can actually use this
100:26 - i can use the select user so i'm going
100:28 - to pull the user
100:30 - here and i'm going to say const user
100:34 - equals use selector and this is from
100:37 - react redux so we need to go ahead and
100:39 - import and then i need to go ahead and
100:41 - say select
100:42 - user and this will import it from
100:43 - features user slice
100:45 - so we're basically going ahead and
100:46 - pulling the user so by default the user
100:49 - will be no
100:50 - okay these are going to be no by default
100:52 - and that's going to go ahead
100:54 - and that's going to give you um nice and
100:57 - somebody says
100:58 - rzo movie trailer says this is cool glad
101:00 - you're enjoying it dude
101:01 - and if you are enjoying and you're still
101:03 - with me smash the thumbs up button
101:04 - almost
101:05 - at 600 likes um so we've got imessage
101:09 - over here
101:10 - and what i'm going to say is if you're
101:12 - logged in so if there is a user if the
101:13 - user exists
101:15 - then what we're going to do is i'm going
101:16 - to say then you render the app
101:18 - so then we render it otherwise yeah i
101:20 - want to render something h2 saying you
101:22 - need
101:23 - to log in okay you need to log in
101:28 - uh we are going to have a logout flow i
101:30 - just made it very discreet in the
101:32 - previous
101:33 - uh example but for example if we're here
101:35 - all you do is you click on the actual
101:37 - icon at the top and it will log you out
101:39 - and that's pretty much how it works i'm
101:42 - just gonna log in
101:44 - again there we go going back boom
101:47 - um all right so there we go uh you see
101:50 - now what it does is it says
101:53 - if there is a user it will render the
101:55 - app otherwise if there's not a user so
101:57 - by default there is no user
101:58 - you need to log in right so this
102:01 - is a good place where we need to be
102:03 - right now so now we're going to build
102:05 - the login
102:05 - page so rather than saying you need to
102:07 - log in i'm going to create a login
102:08 - component
102:09 - okay i'm going to go ahead and create
102:11 - that now so go here and
102:14 - hide all this stuff i'm going to say
102:15 - login.js
102:17 - and i'm going to rfce boom got it and
102:19 - then here we're going to say import
102:22 - login.css
102:25 - and i'm going to go down here to div i'm
102:27 - gonna say class name equals
102:29 - login right and then inside of here
102:32 - we're gonna basically go ahead and build
102:34 - our login but firstly before i do that
102:36 - i'm gonna go ahead and say login.css and
102:39 - then i'm gonna go back to my uh
102:41 - app.js and here i'm going to go ahead
102:44 - and import
102:45 - login like that
102:48 - and now we should be rendering from our
102:51 - login components so i'm going to go here
102:53 - and say login.js
102:58 - um yeah that interpolation is is crazy
103:01 - right so
103:02 - so that's actually called a ternary or
103:04 - uh ternary operator where you can have
103:06 - that sort of
103:07 - if this then that right you can have
103:09 - that as well so that's really really
103:10 - handy
103:10 - to go ahead and use that um so here
103:12 - we're going to have the login
103:14 - login page i guess right so
103:17 - now what i'm going to do is i'm going to
103:20 - actually going to have a
103:21 - login logo so i'm gonna have a login
103:24 - uh logo inside of here i'm gonna have an
103:27 - image
103:27 - the image source i've actually got an
103:30 - image over here this is just pretty much
103:32 - a imessage image so i'm just gonna go
103:34 - ahead and pop that in
103:35 - boom it's a huge imessage uh
103:38 - image and then i've got a h2 underneath
103:40 - it uh h1 which is going to say imessage
103:44 - right and this will pretty much be down
103:46 - here so you can see it says imessage
103:47 - underneath that i'm going to have a
103:49 - material ui button
103:50 - which says sign in okay
103:54 - uh it says button is not fine so i'm
103:55 - going to do my little trick
103:57 - and then it says imported and that trick
104:00 - is control spacebar and it will go ahead
104:01 - and pop that up so now we've got a nice
104:03 - little sign-in button at the bottom
104:04 - okay so first thing i'm going to do is
104:06 - style this so that way it looks a little
104:07 - bit more presentable
104:08 - so let's go to our login.css and
104:12 - then let's go ahead and do login.css
104:15 - so down here i'm going to do dot login
104:18 - i'm going to say display grid because
104:20 - we're using a grid css grid here
104:22 - i'm going to show you guys a neat little
104:23 - trick so if i do place item center
104:27 - this will actually position everything
104:28 - in the center but you can't see that
104:30 - right now because
104:31 - it's not actually showing much so i'm
104:32 - going to go ahead target the inner div
104:34 - the image which is this huge thing
104:36 - object fit contain keeps the aspect
104:38 - ratio when i resize it and height of 150
104:40 - pixels
104:41 - makes it small right if i get rid of
104:43 - this display grid now
104:45 - see everything goes to left so if i do
104:47 - this it centers it on the on the screen
104:49 - right
104:49 - so the next thing i'm going to do is i'm
104:50 - going to say a height of 100 view height
104:52 - this will go ahead and make use of the
104:54 - full screen and then i'm going to say a
104:56 - width of 100
104:57 - right so width of 100 all right i
105:00 - actually don't think i need that but i'm
105:01 - going to keep that for now
105:03 - uh and then what we're going to do is
105:04 - i'm going to go and target that button
105:06 - so i'm going to say target the login
105:09 - button right and i'm going to say width
105:12 - of
105:13 - 300 pixels i want the button to be a
105:14 - little bit bigger i'm also going to give
105:16 - it a background color and this is going
105:17 - to be the imessage blue
105:19 - so boom save that and then we're going
105:21 - to change the color of the text to like
105:23 - a more subtle white
105:24 - i'm going to say the font weight should
105:26 - be 800 as well so i'm going to make a
105:27 - little bit more bold
105:29 - um 800 boom and let's do that
105:33 - save and there you go looks pretty good
105:34 - right now when we hover over it
105:36 - i want to get a little bit more
105:37 - attractive so right now you see it kind
105:39 - of goes white by default
105:40 - we that we can't have that doesn't make
105:42 - sense i'm gonna have it invert
105:44 - essentially and have the color be blue
105:46 - and the background be gray so that looks
105:48 - a bit more cleaner
105:49 - all right so this is all working pretty
105:51 - well okay
105:54 - so alexander says why grid and not flex
105:56 - because that's a really easy trick
105:58 - this one so you can just position the
105:59 - entire container um
106:01 - centrally so it's actually a very very
106:03 - neat thing if you need to do something
106:05 - pretty quick
106:06 - in this case i just wanted to have it
106:07 - very quick and simple in the center of
106:08 - the screen so i went ahead and used
106:10 - css grid right so now what we're going
106:14 - to do is we're going to implement the
106:15 - login functionality so it's a lot easier
106:16 - than you think
106:17 - right because we've set everything up
106:19 - correctly so if you code well guys
106:21 - code something well and then you'll see
106:24 - building on it and all that sort of
106:25 - stuff actually gets
106:26 - very simple because it's not hard to add
106:28 - to well-written code
106:29 - right it's not hard to add to the
106:31 - extensive like extensibility
106:32 - maintainability of while we're in code
106:33 - so
106:34 - with that said what i'm going to do is
106:35 - i'm going to create a function called
106:37 - sign in so i'm going to say const sign
106:38 - in
106:40 - takes an event but we don't actually
106:41 - care about the event so we can ignore
106:43 - that
106:44 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say i
106:47 - need to import the authentication module
106:49 - and the provider from firebase our local
106:52 - firebase
106:53 - that we had earlier right and then if i
106:55 - go down
106:56 - here what i'm going to have is when i
106:58 - click the button
106:59 - i want to basically trigger my sign in
107:02 - function
107:03 - okay and i'm going to make the um
107:07 - yeah we have that so now all i need to
107:09 - do is say auth
107:10 - dot sign in with pop-up
107:13 - okay i go here and i say provider
107:17 - because we initialize this earlier and i
107:19 - don't want to do anything more than that
107:20 - all i want to say is catch if there's
107:22 - any error
107:23 - i'm going to get the error and i'm
107:24 - literally just going to say alert
107:26 - error dot message that's what i'm going
107:28 - to say
107:29 - right alert error.message and that will
107:31 - go ahead and help you out
107:34 - um so if i go ahead and refresh um now
107:36 - if i click sign in
107:37 - boom i get a nice little pop-up and this
107:40 - should be a google authentication
107:41 - sign-in
107:42 - there we go look at that everything's
107:43 - connected if you guys think that's cool
107:45 - hit the thumbs up button
107:47 - um that would be amazing to see that
107:49 - number go up to 600 likes we're close
107:52 - we're close i think we can do it
107:54 - um that's awesome stuff
107:57 - okay so with that said now we're still
108:01 - at 250 concurrent viewers that's amazing
108:03 - thank you so much guys
108:04 - um i'm going to have it so now if i look
108:07 - say for example if i've closed it early
108:08 - you see an error occurred so it says
108:10 - uh the alert got caught here and it
108:13 - displayed the message which is what we
108:14 - want okay
108:16 - so now what we need to do is whenever a
108:18 - login event action
108:19 - occurs inside of app.js i'm going to
108:22 - have a listener
108:23 - so a user factor is what we're going to
108:25 - use here so a use effect
108:27 - i'm going to import it from react and
108:30 - then here i'm going to write the use
108:31 - effect
108:32 - use effect is a piece of code that fires
108:34 - off when the component loads
108:36 - and if you put anything inside these
108:37 - square brackets it will fire off again
108:40 - when that changes for example if i had
108:41 - the user in here every time
108:43 - this would fire off once when the app
108:44 - component loads as well as whenever user
108:47 - changes in any shape or form okay so
108:50 - here what i'm going to say
108:51 - is i want to import the authentication
108:53 - module from our local firebase
108:55 - so i'm going to go ahead import it and
108:57 - then here i'm going to say
108:59 - auth dot uh on auth state change this is
109:03 - like listening now
109:04 - for authentication changes and i'm going
109:05 - to say when
109:07 - any sort of change occurs go ahead and
109:09 - use the auth user
109:11 - so i'm going to do that and i'm going to
109:13 - say if there was an authenticated user
109:17 - then the
109:20 - user is logged in
109:24 - else the user is
109:28 - logged out that's basically the logical
109:30 - flow
109:31 - and then what we're going to do is we're
109:32 - going to get the dispatch remember
109:34 - earlier on i drew that diagram
109:36 - uh whenever we want to add something
109:38 - into the data layer or the redux of
109:40 - onion that i described earlier what we
109:42 - need to do is we need to use the
109:43 - dispatch so here i'm going to say use
109:45 - dispatch um and then i'm going to import
109:48 - it from react
109:49 - react redux so use this patch all we say
109:51 - is we say const
109:52 - dispatch equals use dispatch this gives
109:56 - me like the gun to go ahead and fire
109:59 - a change into um
110:04 - i'm just checking the chat okay yeah
110:07 - goes ahead
110:08 - and um yeah so now we get the gun to go
110:10 - ahead and
110:11 - and fire changes our actions into the
110:14 - reducer so that way it can
110:16 - change the data so now we've got that
110:18 - i'm going to go ahead and
110:19 - import the login
110:23 - and log out action from the user
110:26 - right and then what i'm going to say is
110:27 - if the user's logged if the user is
110:29 - logged out i'm going to say dispatch a
110:30 - logout event
110:32 - right and then if we go to our user
110:34 - slice the logout event simply clears the
110:36 - state.user to know
110:37 - again and then here i'm going to say
110:41 - um
110:44 - someone's asking about kaio kailan uh
110:47 - dude i'm not going to speak about
110:48 - java on this channel right now okay so
110:51 - it's all javascript
110:52 - okay so um what i'm going to say is
110:55 - dispatch login
110:56 - so dispatch login and i'm going to pass
110:58 - in a payload which is an object
111:01 - and here i'm just going to pass in the
111:02 - following we'll say uid
111:05 - is the authentication user so this is
111:07 - what comes back from google
111:09 - so we're going to basically we're
111:10 - basically creating an object for the
111:12 - user we're saying that he should have a
111:13 - photo
111:14 - or she shall follow the user auth user
111:17 - dot
111:19 - photo url and this comes back from
111:22 - google authentication
111:23 - let's say an email and this comes back
111:25 - as auth
111:27 - user.email and then we also
111:29 - have the display name so if they have a
111:32 - name on google for example google
111:34 - collects your name when you sign up we
111:35 - should be able to get that from here so
111:37 - we say auth user dot
111:38 - display name okay save that and now you
111:41 - can see we get everything here
111:42 - so with that said now what should happen
111:45 - is we should see
111:46 - if i could have done this correctly if i
111:48 - go to redox
111:49 - now we should see so it logged me so
111:51 - right now for refresh
111:53 - so i log out because we're not logged in
111:55 - right now so you see inside of our
111:56 - reducer
111:58 - inside of our state we see actual user
112:00 - of no which is why i see the sign in
112:02 - screen
112:02 - if i click sign up notice pay attention
112:04 - to over on the right hand side of the
112:06 - screen
112:06 - and if this works go ahead and smash the
112:08 - thumbs up button okay
112:10 - um let's go ahead and click on sunny
112:13 - let's angle gmail so it should go ahead
112:15 - and say user
112:16 - login so there you go it dispatched a
112:18 - login and look at that guys it actually
112:20 - logged us
112:20 - in so that's dope and everything
112:25 - worked as we wanted it right
112:28 - so that's awesome i cut that one up
112:31 - earlier
112:32 - so that's working as we wanted it okay
112:35 - so
112:36 - and you can see now if i inspect the
112:38 - action it's in the user slice
112:41 - and it was the login action okay now the
112:44 - payload for the user
112:45 - was the user id the photo the email and
112:48 - the display name
112:49 - right so everything works on that front
112:51 - and then you can see the diff
112:52 - is also really really handy so you could
112:56 - do your auth user but inside of redux
112:59 - uh it comes up with a serialization
113:01 - issue because you're trying to
113:04 - conveniently sort of serialize that that
113:07 - object so
113:08 - you'll get an error if you do auth uh
113:10 - user or
113:11 - user um but you can that's why i've just
113:13 - stripped out some of the values but
113:14 - there's a way of doing it in that in
113:15 - that way yeah
113:17 - so now you can see um inside the state
113:21 - the user is populated right so any if i
113:24 - was to refresh
113:26 - look what happens it refreshes and it
113:27 - dispatches the login
113:30 - and it dispatches login so persistence
113:32 - is here
113:34 - right so that's awesome so with that
113:37 - said
113:37 - go ahead and smash the thumbs up button
113:40 - because we're almost at 600
113:41 - likes and the log out functionality i'm
113:44 - going to implement right now for you
113:45 - guys
113:46 - so to log out what i'm going to do is
113:48 - i'm going to have it firstly let's
113:49 - actually go ahead and pull some
113:51 - information
113:52 - from where we didn't need it right so
113:54 - here at the top where we have the avatar
113:57 - so let's go to our sidebar right now
113:59 - inside the sidebar we have the avatar at
114:01 - the top here
114:03 - now i'm going to go ahead and grab the
114:04 - user i'm going to say const user equals
114:05 - use selector
114:07 - and i'm going to say select user which
114:09 - is my selector that i created earlier
114:10 - and i've
114:11 - done all the appropriate imports i
114:12 - needed now with the user
114:14 - what i can do is i can go here and i can
114:16 - say source should be
114:18 - user dot photo
114:21 - now watch what happens boom grab my
114:24 - google login i think that's dope
114:27 - i think that's so dope i think this is
114:29 - getting pretty cool with five likes away
114:31 - from 600 likes pretty sick
114:35 - right when i click on this i want to log
114:37 - out so you're probably wondering oh
114:39 - there's
114:39 - there's a lot of custom coding not
114:41 - really dude what you do is on click
114:43 - and i here i'm going to say i'm going to
114:45 - import the authentication module from
114:47 - firebase
114:48 - to my local firebase so here
114:52 - uh some people are saying how can this
114:53 - be for beginners you're going so fast
114:55 - remember guys this is recorded okay so
114:58 - this
114:58 - is not at the whole point of a live
115:00 - stream it's not meant to be so you can
115:01 - completely like sit alone and type with
115:03 - me
115:04 - it's meant to be so you can enjoy the
115:06 - video watch it
115:07 - you know just enjoy seeing some live
115:09 - coding and things like that
115:10 - and then you can pretty much go ahead
115:12 - and uh pause the video and do it at your
115:15 - own pace
115:16 - afterwards when you watch it back
115:18 - because remember if i was to sit here
115:19 - and wait for everyone
115:20 - that's watching to kind of catch up it's
115:22 - not gonna the video is gonna be a lot
115:24 - longer and a lot less people are gonna
115:25 - find value from it so
115:27 - don't worry it is it is a beginner
115:28 - friendly video you can pretty much go
115:30 - ahead and follow this from start to
115:31 - finish as a beginner
115:32 - and we have plenty of people that have
115:33 - done it and they land their job so quit
115:35 - your complaining
115:36 - let's go all right so here what we're
115:39 - going to do now is i'm going to say
115:41 - an anonymous function auth dot sign out
115:45 - right and then i'm going to say save it
115:48 - and now what we can see is i'm going to
115:50 - show you guys proof of something so i'm
115:52 - going to go here
115:54 - and redux and now you see it signed in
115:56 - so if i go ahead and refresh
116:00 - this is a good comment by the way ayo
116:01 - says for beginners see three to four
116:03 - bills continuously and you'll get the
116:04 - pattern
116:05 - dude exactly exactly that like keep
116:08 - doing that and you're gonna go ahead and
116:10 - see the pattern
116:10 - and it will make a lot of sense right so
116:14 - uh what i want to show you is yes so it
116:15 - dispatched the login up here right
116:17 - now if i go ahead and click the uh the
116:19 - avatar
116:20 - it dispatches a logout action which went
116:22 - ahead and reset the user
116:24 - move my face out of the way it reset the
116:26 - user to no
116:28 - right so now inside the state you should
116:31 - see the user
116:32 - is now no okay so that's what that went
116:34 - ahead and did
116:36 - right so what i'm going to do now is i'm
116:38 - just going to make this
116:40 - actually a little bit smaller so you
116:42 - guys can actually see that bit easier
116:43 - right
116:44 - so there we go um i mean i'm tiny now
116:47 - that's the only thing
116:48 - we're going to make it a little bit
116:49 - bigger i like it it's too small okay
116:51 - so now let me go ahead and sign back in
116:55 - yo
116:56 - athava he goes my mind is blown at the
116:58 - progress i just see right now
117:00 - the blog may go over 5k when i wake up
117:02 - hey let's go dude we just dropped a
117:03 - crazy
117:04 - clever programmer vlog on medium
117:06 - authority go ahead and feel free to drop
117:08 - that on the live chat right
117:10 - now uh and everyone can go ahead and
117:11 - check out the blog when they got a
117:12 - minute
117:13 - there we go so now what we're going to
117:16 - do is it says the channel name
117:18 - and we have the messages right so i
117:20 - guess the next step right now
117:22 - is we want to have this chant these
117:23 - channels right here populated
117:25 - as well as we'll get these messages
117:27 - built out and so forth so for the
117:28 - channel names
117:29 - what we're going to do is these channels
117:31 - are going to not be hard-coded so right
117:33 - now
117:33 - they're hard-coded three sort of things
117:35 - are being popped out right here
117:37 - okay uh also this is a good question do
117:39 - you think react is the way to go on web
117:41 - development i mean is it the future
117:42 - 100 the demand is to the roof and it is
117:46 - really getting busy also
117:47 - we just hit 605 likes thank you so much
117:51 - guys amazing stuff
117:52 - uh love the positivity today and yeah
117:55 - like let's keep going let's try and hit
117:57 - like
117:58 - 700 likes i think we can do it i think
117:59 - we can hit 700 likes
118:01 - um nice that's dope dude also a darva
118:04 - just dropped a link to that 50 page plus
118:07 - amazon complete read through breakdown
118:11 - inside the comment section go ahead and
118:12 - check that out in a sec
118:14 - or maybe open in a separate tab and
118:16 - pretty much you can watch that and read
118:17 - that afterwards but amazing stuff by
118:19 - atarva
118:20 - team is absolutely crushing it man it's
118:23 - insane
118:24 - team is crushing it so here what i'm
118:27 - going to do now
118:28 - is i'm going to have the sidebar.js
118:32 - right
118:32 - and the first thing i'm going to do here
118:34 - is have a piece of state to keep track
118:36 - of this the chats
118:37 - so i'm going to say const charts equal
118:39 - and then set chats
118:41 - and i'm going to say use state right and
118:44 - it's going to have an array empty to
118:45 - ready to begin with
118:46 - now when the app when the sidebar
118:48 - component loads i'm going to use a user
118:50 - effect to fire off piece of code
118:53 - so boom like so right now in here i'm
118:56 - going to have empty brackets for the
118:58 - dependencies
118:59 - um so it's just going to fire off once
119:02 - all right tommy o says i love your cone
119:04 - streams dude i love you guys
119:06 - man i love the support you guys give us
119:08 - it's the only reason i carry on doing
119:09 - them so that's really really awesome to
119:11 - see that
119:12 - then what i'm going to do is i'm going
119:13 - to import
119:15 - the db from our local firebase
119:18 - and i'm going to say db.collection so
119:21 - i'm going to create a collection
119:22 - and inside here we're going to have a
119:23 - collection of chats right
119:25 - and i'm going to say on snapshot so it's
119:28 - going to be a real-time listener which
119:29 - gives us a snapshot of the database
119:31 - whenever anything changes
119:33 - right now when that changes i'm going to
119:35 - say set chats
119:37 - right so as soon as anything in the
119:38 - database changes we get
119:40 - a snapshot and when we get that snapshot
119:42 - back i'm going to say okay go get the
119:44 - snapshot
119:45 - get the document inside the snapshot
119:47 - this is a nosql structure right so if
119:49 - you don't understand what i'm talking
119:50 - about here it's a no
119:51 - sql structure inside of a database maybe
119:54 - watch some of the previous videos watch
119:55 - some of the builds you want you'll
119:56 - understand what's going on here but you
119:59 - can see docs.map
120:01 - and then we're going to say doc and then
120:04 - we're going to say it returns an
120:05 - object right and this object is going to
120:07 - have an id of doctor id
120:10 - and it's going to have the data inside
120:12 - of it as doc
120:13 - dot data now
120:18 - save it okay and it says use date is not
120:22 - defined
120:22 - so we need to go ahead and import use
120:24 - state save
120:26 - it there we go and now we should have
120:30 - chats being pulled in from the database
120:32 - right so here
120:33 - rather than having three hard-coded
120:35 - values what i'm going to say is i'm
120:36 - going to have chats.map and for every
120:38 - single chat what i want to do is i want
120:40 - to render out
120:42 - a sidebar chat boom
120:47 - okay i'm going to render out sidebar
120:48 - chat
120:49 - [Music]
120:52 - and there we go nice and then what i'm
120:54 - going to do is
120:55 - where we get the sidebar chat i'm going
120:56 - to destructure it right
120:58 - so remember we actually create an object
121:00 - here of id and data
121:02 - which means i'm going to go inside here
121:04 - destructure this
121:06 - and say this should have id data
121:10 - right inside of the data we're actually
121:12 - going to have a chat name
121:14 - and this will make sense in a second
121:16 - guys bear with me okay
121:18 - and this will all make sense right
121:22 - so so now what we're going to do is we
121:25 - have the sidebar chat okay
121:27 - so what we're going to have is i'm
121:29 - actually going to pass the id
121:31 - as the key i'm also going to say the
121:35 - id goes through as a prop and then i'm
121:38 - gonna pass a prop called the chat name
121:40 - through so we're gonna say chat name
121:41 - equals chat name
121:43 - and then inside of sidebar chat this
121:46 - will take some props
121:48 - and then the props we're going to
121:49 - destructure and say get id and chat name
121:53 - and then instead of saying channel name
121:55 - this one will now say
121:57 - chat name like that
122:01 - and that should be pretty good okay now
122:05 - here what you should see is it's empty
122:07 - right this is good
122:08 - now when i click this icon over here i
122:10 - want to do a little prompt that gets
122:12 - popped up right
122:13 - so how do we do that so i'm going to go
122:15 - ahead and go to the icon
122:17 - i'm going to say on click right i'm
122:19 - going to create a function called add
122:20 - chat
122:22 - right and then i'm going to go ahead and
122:24 - create the function here when i say add
122:25 - chat
122:25 - and this is an anonymous function and
122:28 - what we do here
122:29 - is i go ahead and say db
122:32 - dot collection chats
122:36 - and basically what it's going to do is
122:37 - it's going to go ahead and add
122:39 - a chat right and remember we added the
122:42 - chat name
122:43 - and basically what i'm going to do is
122:46 - we need to collect like a pop-up should
122:48 - come up so right now if you see in this
122:50 - one
122:50 - we have a pop-up that comes up all right
122:53 - so it says please enter a chat name
122:55 - now hey atharva says the background
122:57 - music and the light somehow sink and
122:59 - like fire that's sick dude thank you so
123:01 - much
123:01 - uh thank you thank melbourne for that
123:03 - everyone went ahead and bought me that
123:04 - stuff so
123:04 - amazing stuff um so all the asynchronous
123:07 - stuff and promises are handled by
123:08 - firebase right sonny
123:09 - yes so firebase handle a lot of the sort
123:12 - of back end headache and the sort of
123:13 - sockets and stuff like that
123:15 - so you don't actually need to worry
123:16 - about a lot of that headache when you're
123:18 - doing this right
123:19 - so here we're going to go ahead and say
123:21 - const
123:22 - chat name equals prompt right and this
123:26 - prompts the user for an input and what
123:28 - we're going to say is please
123:30 - enter a chat name
123:35 - all right please enter a chat name and
123:36 - then what we're going to say is if there
123:38 - was a chat name so we're going to kind
123:39 - of protect the user
123:40 - if there's a chat room then we'll do
123:42 - this database call
123:44 - right and then we're going to basically
123:45 - go ahead and say say it to the chat name
123:47 - now this will actually go ahead should
123:49 - do it for us so now if i go ahead and
123:51 - click
123:51 - let's go ahead and say youtube boom
123:55 - real time that was sick
123:58 - and it worked in the first try hey
124:02 - my best friend jay's in the house sunny
124:04 - on a solo react video got a smash that
124:06 - like for a solo run
124:07 - amen brother that's it we're doing well
124:09 - we've got quite a few
124:10 - viewers still on we've got 243 people
124:12 - across youtube
124:14 - and facebook right now absolutely
124:15 - smashing it and also dude
124:17 - i don't know if you can see the lights
124:18 - upgrade the cell it's looking good man
124:21 - um there you go so you see we've got
124:23 - that we've got youtube and let's just go
124:24 - ahead and type in something like
124:26 - apple fans or let's just say papa react
124:29 - papa react squad
124:32 - there we go boom oh man oh i kind of
124:35 - went off a bit
124:36 - but you know it's fine um it's going to
124:39 - be responsive up to a certain degree
124:41 - um so that looks pretty good okay and
124:43 - then what we're going to say
124:44 - is we are going to go down to
124:48 - the uh so we've done that bit now
124:53 - so what i want to also do is i want to
124:54 - protect this against
124:56 - a sort of scrolling issue so i'm going
124:58 - to go into my sidebar.css
125:00 - and for the sidebar chats so inside of
125:03 - here
125:03 - so i'm going to go into my cybor.css now
125:06 - for sidebar chats we've actually already
125:07 - added the overflow
125:08 - okay that's good so we will protect if
125:11 - we do this but it gets sort of
125:12 - spammed right so right now it's room
125:15 - based
125:16 - this chat is going to be room based and
125:17 - the reason why i donate room based is
125:19 - because it's going to be
125:20 - easier to uh go ahead and have you guys
125:23 - interact with each other
125:24 - okay now why is it not fetching the
125:26 - photo so if you know it's inside the
125:27 - actual build
125:28 - this is the last person who've sent the
125:30 - message so in this case it'll be kazi
125:32 - and then if i go ahead and say yo what's
125:35 - up guys
125:36 - notice how it'll be me and it'll say yo
125:38 - what's up guy with my last timestamp
125:40 - there you go see that that's why it
125:42 - hasn't done it just yet
125:43 - so we need to implement this part the
125:46 - messages
125:46 - and then i can go ahead and connect the
125:48 - last message right here
125:50 - okay so what we're going to do now is
125:52 - i'm going to have it so when i click
125:53 - on one of these rooms i go ahead and
125:56 - dispatch some information into
125:57 - the redux store about what channel we're
126:00 - in so in order to do that first i'm
126:02 - going to go into my features
126:03 - i'm going to actually going to add a
126:04 - whole nother slice of state
126:06 - so i'm going to copy and paste my user
126:08 - slice i'm going to rename it
126:10 - to chat slice okay so chatsize.js
126:14 - and then here what i'm going to say is
126:16 - i'm going to go ahead and
126:17 - change user slice all of this stuff to
126:21 - chat i'm going to go over here and
126:22 - double check so
126:25 - chat chat in the beginning this is not
126:27 - going to be this is going to be chat id
126:30 - and it's going to be chat name
126:33 - right and then it's going to be
126:37 - um we're going to go ahead and say set
126:40 - chat
126:40 - right right there's only going to be one
126:42 - action and this one
126:44 - we need to export it so we can use it
126:45 - outside
126:47 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
126:48 - when we get this action it's going to be
126:51 - state.chat
126:52 - id equals action.payload.chat id
126:56 - copy that line and i'm going to go ahead
126:58 - and refactor this to say chat name
127:02 - oh man i messed up i'll show you guys a
127:04 - quick trick come on d if i do chat name
127:06 - there we go
127:07 - boom save it uh oh to do that
127:10 - uh keyboard shortcut if you highlight a
127:13 - variable and you do command d
127:15 - you see it highlights all the possible
127:17 - ones when you get multiple cursors
127:19 - right so that's pretty sick and they'll
127:21 - allow you to be very fast with your
127:22 - coding
127:23 - now we have the set chat being exported
127:25 - so the next thing we want to do is
127:26 - actually go ahead and create selectors
127:28 - to pull that information so i'm going to
127:29 - make one called select chat name
127:31 - so select chat and the section i need
127:34 - just to select chat name
127:35 - and this goes into our state into the
127:38 - chat slice and it gets the chat name
127:40 - i'm going to copy and paste this and i'm
127:41 - going to go ahead and say select chat
127:43 - oops select chat id i'm going to go down
127:45 - here and say select chat id
127:47 - done right so this is looking pretty
127:50 - good
127:52 - right um so atharva says a man build
127:56 - with actual socket i o can also increase
127:58 - the possibilities and include
127:59 - functionality
127:59 - so you can do all of this dude with
128:01 - firebase so don't underestimate firebase
128:03 - um you can have all of that
128:07 - inside of firebase and it'll be a lot
128:08 - easier to build it um so you don't need
128:10 - to go ahead and
128:11 - like sort of overcomplicate by
128:13 - introducing one you you can introduce
128:14 - some ones that can do it that way
128:16 - and have like the skype functionality
128:17 - and things like that but you know
128:19 - only do what you kind of need to do
128:20 - unless at the point at which you need to
128:22 - do it
128:22 - so what i'm going to do is now connect
128:24 - this to the store
128:27 - so if i go into my store copy and paste
128:29 - there we go
128:30 - now we've got the user reducer right so
128:32 - here i'm going to change this to become
128:35 - so i'm going to change this oops i don't
128:38 - want to do that
128:39 - i'm going to go ahead and change this to
128:40 - become
128:43 - oh man overdone i'm going to go ahead
128:45 - and do user it's going to be the chat
128:47 - reducer
128:48 - and i'm going to copy paste and this one
128:51 - is going to be
128:53 - chat reducer
128:56 - chat reducer done right
128:59 - so loads of people saying why don't you
129:01 - upload react native tutorials because
129:03 - i'm literally dropping a react tutorial
129:04 - for you now dude
129:06 - i'm i'm trying to do as much as i can
129:08 - for you guys in terms of value based
129:10 - stuff
129:10 - also profit javascript is on fire right
129:12 - now we have a lot happening inside there
129:14 - so um yeah if you want to get the most
129:17 - from us make sure you subscribe make
129:18 - sure you hit the like button
129:19 - and just stay tuned we will be dropping
129:21 - as much content as you can possibly
129:23 - imagine
129:24 - so don't worry guys it's coming now to
129:26 - check that we've correctly linked up
129:27 - everything inside the db what i'm going
129:29 - to do is open up redux
129:31 - and we should see inside the state which
129:33 - is the user and we should see the new
129:34 - chat slice
129:35 - so if you get this you're pretty good at
129:37 - this point right
129:39 - so imran says hey sunny just amazing bro
129:41 - keep going appreciate that dude thank
129:43 - you so much
129:44 - um now what we're gonna do is for the i
129:46 - am a message so right now
129:48 - um i don't know why i'm not pulling the
129:50 - uh if i'll go ahead and say test
129:52 - uh oh yeah so right now actually if i go
129:55 - ahead and refresh you see it's not
129:56 - actually saving it because
129:58 - what we need to do is we need to go over
129:59 - here so if you actually go ahead and
130:01 - inspect and do the console i'll show you
130:03 - why
130:04 - because we haven't actually set up a
130:05 - firebase yet you see here you get this
130:07 - long
130:07 - could not reach for cloud firestore back
130:09 - end because we need to initialize it
130:11 - this is live right now it they said is
130:14 - this being premiered or live this is
130:15 - live
130:16 - cloud firestore we go here and then
130:18 - we're going to go ahead and say create
130:20 - database
130:20 - i'm going to start in test mode and i'm
130:22 - going to go ahead and click
130:24 - next i'm going to go ahead and do my
130:26 - about this
130:27 - enable this will go ahead and set up the
130:28 - firestore database
130:30 - so whoa man i'm not gonna read
130:33 - um holy
130:45 - okay right so
130:48 - now what we're gonna do is um
130:51 - so pedro to answer your question that's
130:53 - an arrow function the essex arrow
130:54 - function
130:55 - um same said just different syntax right
130:59 - right so so many people are saying at
131:01 - devtools is anything to see redux yes
131:03 - i literally just showed you guys so
131:05 - redux dev tools
131:07 - um you need to install the redux
131:08 - devtools but this is all redux
131:10 - right now this is relaxed actions this
131:11 - is redux state
131:13 - everything is redux yeah um
131:16 - thank you so much ronit he says oh nice
131:18 - my man that's freaking awesome really
131:19 - awesome content bro appreciate it thank
131:22 - you dude
131:22 - all right so now what i'm going to do is
131:24 - if we go ahead and add it in now so
131:26 - i'm just to visualize this for you guys
131:28 - i'm going to go ahead
131:29 - close this up and you guys are going to
131:31 - see now if i create a room and then i
131:32 - say like
131:33 - let's call it youtube enter and if i
131:37 - show you guys the firebase um so now i
131:40 - created a chat
131:41 - create the chat name youtube dope okay
131:43 - another one called
131:44 - cp team
131:46 - [Music]
131:48 - look at that you see in real time it
131:49 - created one called cp team
131:51 - right now if i was to go ahead and
131:52 - delete this one
131:54 - look on the right yeah in real time
131:58 - boom that's what you call snapshot
132:00 - that's the snapshot that's kicking in
132:02 - right so i'm going to go ahead and do
132:04 - another one so let's go ahead and say
132:06 - team cp because it sounds bad there we
132:08 - go created there boom
132:10 - but it's real time sync between the app
132:12 - and the back end
132:13 - so that's really powerful now we're
132:14 - gonna basically go ahead and create the
132:16 - messages
132:17 - okay so for the messages what we're to
132:19 - do is we're going to go to chat.js
132:20 - and here in chat.js right now we have
132:23 - everything hard coded okay
132:25 - so in order to fix this what i'm going
132:26 - to do is i'm going to go ahead and
132:28 - inside the messages i'm actually going
132:29 - to create a message component
132:31 - right so the message component so here
132:33 - i'm going to go ahead and get rid of
132:34 - these
132:35 - and for the message component i need to
132:37 - create a message
132:38 - component it's also message.js rfce
132:44 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
132:45 - import oops
132:47 - import message.css
132:53 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
132:55 - message.css
132:56 - so if darva says i love the realtime
132:57 - function i'll let you firebase because
132:59 - you don't need to refresh the client to
133:00 - make the changes visible
133:01 - exactly and that's very important
133:03 - imagine you had an app which is saying
133:05 - when your order is ready
133:06 - you need to be able to go ahead and do
133:07 - that right so that's going to be very
133:09 - important and that's what firebase
133:10 - pretty much fixes for you outside out of
133:12 - the box
133:13 - um so very very powerful stuff um
133:16 - okay so then we're gonna go ahead and
133:18 - say
133:19 - uh for the message so each message is
133:23 - gonna take a
133:24 - uh two parameters right it's gonna take
133:26 - contents and it's gonna take
133:28 - uh so i'm gonna destruction i'm gonna
133:30 - take an idm and contents
133:32 - right and then the message itself
133:35 - is gonna be it's gonna have an avatar
133:39 - all right so i'm gonna go ahead and say
133:40 - avatar
133:43 - auto import from react material ui and
133:45 - then we're going to have a p tag with
133:47 - the message inside of it so this is a
133:49 - message
133:52 - uh jay good question dude he goes why
133:54 - not use module.css you can separate css
133:56 - for each component
133:57 - very good question and yes what that
133:59 - does is it prevents you from having
134:00 - naming clashes
134:02 - but for now what i would say is when
134:04 - when people are learning and things like
134:05 - that so yes module.css is really good
134:08 - um bem is just very quick for when i'm
134:11 - building also there is a benefit to them
134:13 - for example like
134:14 - if i go into my login right and i
134:16 - basically say i'm new to the programming
134:18 - like new to whatever i'm coding
134:20 - if i do command shift f and i do this it
134:22 - will actually give me
134:23 - the exact location of that and then it
134:26 - will actually find it in the css whereas
134:28 - if i was using uh module.css it's kind
134:30 - of difficult but it's not difficult by
134:32 - it
134:33 - the truth is module.css is better yes
134:35 - but bem is a really good
134:37 - naming convention to to practice and it
134:39 - gets you very good at
134:41 - it basically breaks the bad habit of
134:43 - naming and then i would say progress to
134:45 - module.css
134:46 - so really really good um question bro uh
134:49 - aegis says let's go
134:50 - nice keep the energy high awesome stuff
134:54 - thank you i guess um right so this is a
134:57 - message
134:58 - and then we're gonna go ahead and create
134:59 - a small tag and here i'm gonna have a
135:02 - timestamp
135:03 - okay and then i'm gonna go back to my
135:05 - chat and then here i'm gonna import
135:08 - message from the top so there we go you
135:10 - can see this is a message right
135:12 - now i'm going to go ahead and paste this
135:14 - a few times we should have three
135:15 - messages popping out
135:17 - nice now inside the message i'm going to
135:19 - go ahead and pull out message.css
135:21 - i'm going to pull this underneath
135:25 - and then i'm going to go ahead and pull
135:27 - out my message
135:29 - so i can see here right now for the
135:30 - message i'm going to say dot message
135:37 - uh oh yeah some people had
135:41 - a comment them inside there inside the
135:43 - return block i remember that um
135:45 - display flex uh save it and everything
135:48 - goes into a row you don't see it because
135:50 - this needs to be class name
135:52 - message there we go
135:55 - and then i'm going to say align item
135:57 - center because it should go in the
135:59 - center
135:59 - i'll say position relative because we're
136:01 - going to do some absolute positioning
136:03 - inside of it
136:04 - with another component i'm going to say
136:06 - width should be fit
136:07 - content because we only want the bubble
136:09 - to be as big as it needs to be
136:10 - i say justify content space between
136:13 - because i want it to be sort of spaced
136:14 - out as much as it can be
136:16 - i'll say margin of 15 pixels so around
136:19 - remember
136:19 - margins outside the component uh padding
136:22 - is inside the component
136:24 - now the next thing okay
136:27 - the next thing we're going to do is
136:28 - we're going to say the message and then
136:30 - target the p
136:30 - tag inside right so the p tag inside
136:33 - there we go
136:34 - and i'm going to add a background color
136:35 - font size medium padding 15 pixels
136:37 - border radius 20 to get that rounded
136:39 - effect
136:40 - margin 10 pixels to add some more
136:41 - separation around the back around it
136:43 - and then a margin right pushes it all
136:45 - the way to the side okay for this one
136:48 - now what i'm also going to do is target
136:50 - that small tag
136:52 - i'm going to say go ahead and target
136:53 - small tag gray position absolute but
136:55 - because the parent is relative
136:57 - it actually goes ahead and stays
136:58 - relative to its parent and then it's
137:00 - bottom
137:01 - minus five and this goes ahead and adds
137:03 - a little timestamp like this
137:05 - so very clean right now
137:08 - what if i want to have it so that we
137:10 - have a sender as well so
137:11 - we'll figure out the sender afterwards
137:13 - so the blue message so
137:15 - if you send the message you want to be
137:17 - this side blue
137:18 - so i'm going to show you guys how to do
137:19 - that in just a bit but right now what
137:21 - i'm going to do is i'm going to have it
137:22 - so that when you enter
137:23 - it's actually going to go ahead and send
137:25 - a message into this right now
137:27 - okay so let's go ahead and do that first
137:28 - so the way we do that
137:30 - is firstly i need to have a keep track
137:32 - of all the messages coming in
137:34 - so inside of chat.js what i'm going to
137:36 - do is i'm going to say const messages
137:38 - set messages equals
137:42 - use state okay and then i'm going to do
137:45 - this
137:47 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
137:50 - um
137:54 - right so before we do this actually what
137:56 - we need to do
137:57 - is we need to fix a problem we need to
137:59 - fix one so i need to have it so when i
138:00 - click one of these
138:02 - it changes this to the channel right so
138:04 - if i click on the sidebar
138:06 - let's go to the sidebar dot js we have
138:08 - to solve this issue first so cyborg.js
138:10 - what i'm going to do now
138:11 - is have it so that when i click on the
138:14 - sidebar chat
138:15 - component so inside the sidebar chat
138:17 - component
138:20 - i should have it so when i click on that
138:22 - it goes ahead and dispatches an action
138:24 - so i'm going to show you guys how you
138:25 - can do this with an inline function
138:27 - so here i'm going to say on click
138:30 - i'm going to do an inline function and
138:32 - i'm going to say dispatch
138:35 - and i'm going to say dispatch and we'll
138:37 - do the imports and stuff afterwards i'm
138:38 - going to say set chat so this is a
138:40 - action that we
138:41 - set up earlier inside the app inside the
138:44 - chat slice
138:45 - and this will actually go ahead and take
138:47 - the chat id
138:49 - which is the id we passed in as a prop
138:51 - and it's also going to set the chat name
138:54 - as the chat name as a prop which came in
138:56 - as prop this means that we basically go
138:58 - ahead and set this up inside of our
139:00 - redux store so that way we can access it
139:02 - outside of any other
139:03 - place right so here i'm going to say
139:06 - const
139:08 - [Music]
139:11 - dispatch sorry
139:14 - dispatch
139:18 - equals use dispatch
139:21 - import it get rid of this boom
139:24 - um cesar says it's amazing how you know
139:27 - what you need to do step by step i
139:29 - understand how to do it myself with the
139:30 - project from scratch by scratch because
139:32 - i get lost by myself thank you sonny it
139:34 - just takes practice dude i remember in
139:35 - the beginning i used to be like freaking
139:37 - out and like panicking everywhere
139:38 - it just takes practice you'll get used
139:40 - to it honestly don't stress man
139:43 - uh just don't give up that's my main
139:44 - advice um
139:47 - i just broke something um
139:53 - line 13 oh yeah
139:56 - chat name boom
139:59 - boom
140:14 - all right one second guys we've got this
140:17 - we got this
140:20 - dispatch an object that's the end of the
140:23 - dispatch
140:24 - that's the end of this
140:28 - okay unexpected error
140:31 - god damn it there's always some kind of
140:33 - error when we when we do this stuff so
140:36 - let me go ahead and check something
140:37 - quickly the dispatch save it
140:39 - boom okay and then we've got the
140:41 - dispatch itself we've got the set chat
140:43 - we've got the id
140:46 - okay
140:49 - this is because of the following
141:03 - [Music]
141:09 - okay there we go and then i'm gonna say
141:11 - const dispatch
141:19 - equals use dispatch these brackets are
141:22 - ruining the show
141:23 - honestly dude yeah it's sometimes the
141:26 - bracket just piss me off man
141:27 - yeah so it comes dispatch there you go
141:31 - and then what i'm going to say is const
141:34 - chat info equals search envelope so this
141:37 - will be
141:38 - important for afterwards actually but
141:39 - we'll do that later so
141:41 - set chat is not defined line 13 this is
141:43 - because we need to go ahead and import
141:44 - this action
141:45 - we set that up earlier inside of our
141:47 - chat slice and redux and now
141:49 - what this should do is when i do this it
141:51 - will dispatch an action in redux
141:53 - so if i go down here you should see look
141:56 - so
141:57 - fresh piece of state so if i click team
141:59 - cp it goes ahead and sets the chat and
142:01 - it changes the chat name
142:03 - so remember by the way changes the chat
142:05 - name to team cp
142:06 - and chat id to the chat id right if i
142:08 - click on youtube
142:09 - it changes it so dispatch an action
142:11 - change the name to youtube
142:12 - and the chat id to the id that's based
142:15 - inside of firebase now that's very
142:17 - important
142:17 - because we're going to use that
142:18 - afterwards to go ahead and fetch the
142:20 - correct messages for this component
142:22 - so it's very it's very cleverly
142:23 - connected right
142:25 - so once that's done now what we can do
142:28 - is we can go ahead and actually pull
142:29 - that information in at the top
142:31 - right so we go ahead and go to our
142:34 - um let's go to uh
142:40 - chat.js and inside of chat.js now what i
142:43 - can do is i can use my selector so i can
142:45 - say go ahead and say chat name
142:47 - equals use selector i could say
142:50 - select chat name and i can pull this in
142:53 - and that's a special import so let's
142:55 - pull it in over there
142:57 - and then what we can say is rather than
142:59 - having channel name
143:00 - set over here i can actually go ahead
143:02 - and say channel
143:03 - name and now it says channel name is not
143:06 - the file oh sorry chat name
143:08 - chat name goddammit yeah somebody said
143:11 - yeah jay said you missed an open bracket
143:13 - yeah
143:13 - i know they found it in the end so now
143:15 - if we click youtube
143:16 - team tp hey see it changes at the top
143:19 - and we also have access to the id
143:21 - right so now what i'm going to have
143:24 - um awesome and
143:27 - you know foreign
143:30 - how did you manage programming fitness
143:33 - and lifestyle also dude
143:35 - ask nicely okay when you're at 22
143:38 - 25 uh 22 to 25 age
143:41 - um how do what you mean how did you
143:43 - manage you just do it man
143:45 - just do it stop complaining or finding
143:47 - excuses you literally just make it
143:49 - happen
143:50 - like if i don't really know the question
143:52 - like how did you manage to do that at
143:53 - that age
143:54 - like what's stopping you from doing it
143:55 - at that age that's what you need to kind
143:57 - of reset your
143:58 - your sort of mindset around it um
144:02 - okay so then what we're going to go
144:05 - ahead and do
144:06 - is have it load the appropriate messages
144:08 - right
144:09 - so this is going to take a two-step
144:11 - process so the first one
144:12 - is we go into our chat.js and we need to
144:14 - create a piece of state
144:15 - for the messages to keep track of what's
144:17 - going on so messages
144:19 - set messages okay and i'm going to say
144:21 - use
144:22 - state this is going to be an empty array
144:25 - um
144:27 - says how are you sunny i'm good dude how
144:29 - are you sorry if i pronounced the name
144:31 - wrong
144:32 - um yeah we're going to create a user
144:34 - fact
144:35 - all right i'm also going to get the chat
144:37 - id so i'm going to say const
144:38 - chat id equals use selector
144:43 - use selector and we'll say select
144:46 - chat id right
144:50 - right so now what i'm gonna do is
144:53 - i'm gonna go here and then i'm to go
144:55 - ahead and say
144:57 - so that's all working well now the chat
144:58 - id is there so now i'm going to go to
145:00 - the use effect
145:01 - and basically use effect again there's a
145:03 - piece of code that fires off
145:05 - once when the checkpoint loads and also
145:07 - whenever a dependency inside these
145:09 - square brackets changes for example in
145:10 - this case
145:11 - we need this to refresh every time the
145:13 - chat id changes because i'm going to
145:15 - need the chat id here so i'm going to
145:16 - say
145:17 - if a chat id was selected so
145:20 - we only get selects one when i click on
145:23 - one of these options then i would
145:24 - populate the store
145:25 - with a chat id when that happens i'm
145:28 - going to go ahead and say db
145:29 - dot collection db.collection
145:33 - i'm going to go inside of um
145:38 - hey tzuyler says i think i'm going to be
145:40 - on this channel from now on
145:41 - nice dude appreciate that so we're going
145:44 - to say db.collection
145:46 - chat and then we'll say doc and then the
145:49 - doc is going to be the chat id
145:51 - right so we're actually going to go into
145:53 - that chat and then we're going to say go
145:54 - into the collection inside of that chat
145:57 - and access the messages so essentially
145:59 - what we're doing is we're going inside
146:01 - the chat
146:02 - room so inside that inside this chat
146:04 - room
146:05 - we're going to go inside the collection
146:06 - of messages and then i'm going to say
146:09 - order by because we're actually going to
146:10 - set up a timestamp
146:12 - so i'll say order by a timestamp and
146:14 - then i'm going to say order by a
146:15 - descending timestamp
146:16 - so that'll be for a bit afterwards um
146:20 - jay says handling the chat and coding a
146:21 - goddamn imessage from scratch at the
146:23 - same time it's not an easy feat
146:25 - pure talent appreciate that dude and
146:27 - then what we're going to say is on
146:28 - snapshot right now snapshot is something
146:30 - that we do
146:31 - when we want to get a real-time feedback
146:32 - so if anything changes inside the db
146:35 - so we're going to use set messages so
146:37 - the hook and then we're going to go
146:38 - ahead and say snapshot.docs.map
146:41 - and then we're going to say doc right
146:42 - now for every single dock that comes
146:44 - back
146:44 - i'm going to map it to a object and this
146:47 - is going to map to the doc.id
146:50 - and also the data god's sake i hate that
146:52 - thing data
146:53 - dot dot data okay so i was like
146:56 - like that and what this is going to do
146:58 - is i know that might be a
146:59 - like a mouthful right here but what this
147:01 - is doing is it's basically when i click
147:03 - on this
147:04 - it's finding this inside the db this
147:07 - room
147:07 - all the collec the messages inside of
147:09 - collection there's grabbing them
147:11 - and storing them inside of the messages
147:13 - array okay
147:15 - um go back and sing says this is this is
147:17 - amazing attended it for the first time
147:19 - thank you so much dude
147:21 - um yeah glad you guys are enjoying this
147:23 - and again we're almost at 700 likes
147:28 - right jugutha says wow sunny is the best
147:32 - in react thanks i learned a lot from you
147:34 - appreciate that dude thank you so much
147:36 - for the kind words um
147:37 - let's keep on going strong okay so
147:41 - now what we're gonna do is we have the
147:43 - messages coming back right so
147:45 - here rather than having the messages
147:47 - hard-coded i'm gonna say for all of the
147:49 - messages
147:49 - go ahead and map through them and for
147:51 - each message i wanna render out an
147:53 - implicit return
147:55 - so an implicit message return and then
147:57 - we're going to go ahead and say
147:58 - render out a message and in that message
148:02 - should have a key
148:04 - with the id and here i'm going to
148:06 - destructure
148:09 - the what comes back for every message
148:11 - i'm going to get the id and the data
148:13 - and then we're going to pass in the
148:14 - contents of the message and that's going
148:17 - to be the data
148:18 - and the id is going to be the key okay
148:22 - and that will be that and then save it
148:25 - and now you should see if i click it
148:26 - that's pretty i know it doesn't look
148:28 - good
148:29 - but it is correct it's working trust me
148:31 - on that it's working
148:32 - right um you dating says i love you man
148:35 - you're great
148:36 - uh we have a sauron saying i love it
148:40 - sure up says um you're one of the best
148:42 - cheers of react after bad love from
148:43 - pakistan thank you so much dude
148:45 - um set messages and on snapchat in one
148:48 - command until now they were separate
148:50 - yeah
148:50 - it's really really powerful to write
148:52 - like that right so the next thing we're
148:54 - going to do now is this is actually sort
148:56 - of when i click this it's going ahead
148:57 - and fetching it
148:58 - right so it's fetching the messages but
149:00 - we need a way to push messages inside
149:02 - right now so
149:03 - i'm going to go ahead and do that as
149:04 - well so right now earlier we set up the
149:06 - input map
149:08 - we mapped the input sort of piece of
149:09 - state to our input field over here
149:11 - and then we had it map on the on change
149:13 - so as i type in down here
149:15 - pretty much goes ahead and stores it
149:16 - inside of our local state now when we we
149:18 - create a send message
149:20 - we said e dot prevent default to prevent
149:22 - the refreshing from happening
149:24 - and then we said firebase magic so this
149:25 - is where the firebase magic happens
149:27 - right
149:27 - so i'm gonna go ahead and say
149:28 - db.collection i'm gonna go back into the
149:31 - chats
149:32 - right the collection of chats i'm gonna
149:34 - go into the doc dock and the dock here
149:36 - is gonna be the chat id
149:38 - and then i'm gonna say go into the
149:40 - collection
149:42 - of messages
149:45 - all right and then what i'm gonna say is
149:48 - add
149:50 - right so go into connection messages and
149:52 - then i'm going to say add
149:53 - and at this point what we do is we
149:55 - pretty much go ahead and add what we
149:56 - need so we're going to add a timestamp
149:58 - now the timestamp is going to be
150:00 - different for everyone for example if
150:01 - you're in india or if you're in la
150:03 - if you're in new york your timestamps
150:05 - can be different to me in london
150:06 - so what i need to do is i need to go
150:07 - ahead to the top and say import firebase
150:09 - from firebase
150:11 - okay so import firebase from firebase
150:12 - not the local one the actual firebase
150:15 - and here i'm going to say firebase.first
150:18 - right which is a function i'm going to
150:20 - say field value no window function so
150:22 - we're going to say field value
150:24 - and then i'm going to say server
150:28 - server timestamp and that's a function
150:31 - this will go ahead and give
150:32 - me the time of the actual server so that
150:34 - way
150:35 - even if you sent it based in london even
150:37 - if you sent this
150:38 - and um hey ismail saying london baby
150:40 - thanks for doing this on a friday night
150:42 - it's a good way to end your friday night
150:44 - nice guys
150:45 - awesome stuff um bala ganesh says thank
150:48 - you so much
150:49 - um for providing the valuable
150:51 - information keep inspiring and
150:53 - motivating us thank you so much dude
150:55 - um messed up the camera a little bit
150:56 - there um but then we've got the time
150:58 - stamp so
150:59 - regardless of where you're based in um
151:04 - nice he says dude i see you in the
151:06 - projects more than anything else during
151:07 - my day i don't give up do you know
151:09 - already what the next project will be
151:10 - react nate have a bunch of stuff
151:12 - happening we've got loads of stuff
151:13 - coming guys just keep
151:14 - subscribed and keep an eye on my
151:16 - instagram go ahead and follow me
151:17 - uh over here if you're not following me
151:19 - to keep track of when we drop the latest
151:21 - and greatest videos
151:22 - okay so message here i'm gonna say input
151:26 - and then i'm also to give uid and this
151:28 - one is going to be
151:29 - user so again and now i need the user's
151:32 - information so
151:33 - the message contents are going to be
151:35 - here we're going to pull that from the
151:36 - input okay
151:37 - but i need the user who actually sent
151:39 - the message so in order to do that
151:41 - i'm going to get the user i'm going to
151:43 - say select
151:44 - use selector sorry use selector
151:47 - and then i'm going to say select user so
151:50 - this is my select user
151:52 - and then i'm going to go ahead and make
151:53 - sure this is import okay we've already
151:54 - imported it um
151:57 - so soham thank you so much for the kind
151:59 - words bonjour attacks enjoying it nice
152:01 - stuff guys
152:02 - um so i'm gonna go ahead and save that
152:08 - and then what we're gonna do is
152:13 - we're gonna go ahead and have it so that
152:16 - it pushes
152:17 - the um we've got the message here but
152:20 - i've also wanted a bunch of other things
152:21 - i want the uid
152:22 - the photo the email the display name all
152:24 - from the user item
152:25 - right so what i do is i go uid equals
152:28 - user.uid so remember when you log in
152:30 - we populate the user inside the redux
152:32 - store we just use the selector to go
152:34 - ahead and grab it from the redux store
152:36 - which gives us the user object and
152:37 - that's how we go ahead and get the user
152:39 - that we're going to push in
152:40 - for every single object that also gives
152:42 - us the photo
152:43 - okay now borax says you're like a
152:45 - magician
152:46 - thank you dude appreciate it um
152:48 - [Music]
152:50 - good positivity right um
152:53 - i love this because i don't find it
152:55 - coincidence on my motivation i've just
152:56 - told me don't give up on something you
152:58 - can't stop thinking about every single
152:59 - day
153:00 - exactly exactly keep doing what you love
153:04 - right so that with that said now what we
153:07 - actually have is a really nice
153:09 - really nice system which should be
153:10 - working okay so let's go ahead and check
153:12 - it out
153:12 - so firstly i'm also going to go ahead
153:14 - and update the message
153:15 - itself before we do that so everything
153:18 - should come in clutch
153:19 - and work together right so first thing
153:21 - i'm going to do is the contents actually
153:22 - have a bunch of things inside of it
153:24 - so uh my girlfriend is obsessed with
153:26 - proper react do you know do you guys
153:28 - know who papa react is who the heck is
153:29 - proper react
153:30 - hey i love her honestly and she goes i
153:34 - miss him she guys
153:35 - she misses out on time with me for these
153:36 - streams so smash the thumbs up button
153:38 - right and uh and show some love and
153:40 - support for that all right
153:42 - so over here i'm going to say content
153:44 - i'm going to destructure right
153:46 - jay goes oh the og arrives this is where
153:49 - it comes up
153:50 - um she goes guys show some love he's
153:53 - doing so well let's tap that like button
153:54 - guys we're at 660 likes
153:56 - can we get to 700 i think so i think so
154:00 - right um so now i'm gonna go ahead and
154:03 - destructure the contents right so over
154:05 - here
154:05 - i'm gonna say timestamp when i say
154:08 - display name
154:10 - i'm gonna say email so i'm breaking it
154:12 - apart the object right now i'm gonna say
154:14 - message photo and uid
154:17 - right uid save it and then it says line
154:20 - seven is an error no what do i do
154:24 - yeah i need to close this and then
154:27 - oh what the hell happened here so
154:30 - we've got this boom boom
154:34 - there we go all right
154:37 - um i think we can get to 700 likes i
154:39 - think we can
154:40 - uh petition to get marvin next to
154:43 - sunny's
154:44 - uh in the next video a hundred percent i
154:47 - think we can get that one in this video
154:48 - i'll teach you how to code guys we can
154:49 - do that
154:50 - right um and that'll be awesome
154:54 - uh and the one here is actually papa and
154:56 - no
154:57 - we don't talk about angular here guys we
154:59 - hate that
155:01 - all right so uh yes papa and mama
155:04 - together yeah she's gonna be mama react
155:06 - guys
155:06 - so get her on the channel early we're
155:09 - actually gonna have a we're actually
155:10 - thinking of starting a youtube channel
155:11 - together so that would be fun
155:13 - um right now guys with that said now the
155:16 - avatar the source
155:17 - for the avatar is actually going to be
155:19 - the photo that comes through right so
155:21 - the photo that we destruction
155:23 - uh there we go um
155:26 - so inspiring man love from bangladesh by
155:28 - the way where are you from sunny
155:29 - london dude based and born in london
155:32 - right now for the p tag i'm gonna say
155:34 - this is a message rather than that one
155:36 - actually dropped a dynamic message just
155:38 - being pulled in
155:39 - um then we're gonna go ahead and say
155:43 - uh timestamp so for the timestamp you
155:45 - need to do some clever passing right so
155:46 - i'm gonna go ahead and drop a snippet in
155:48 - here
155:48 - and i'll explain what it does it says
155:50 - create a new date from the timestamp
155:51 - optional training protects it against
155:53 - because there are times where it's
155:54 - asynchronous
155:55 - and it's pretty much gonna have a uh
155:57 - it's gonna have an undefined value so
155:59 - you protect yourself with optional
156:00 - training
156:01 - you say pass it to a date and then
156:02 - you're gonna basically go ahead and
156:03 - format it to a locale string
156:06 - uh so we can go ahead and save that and
156:08 - i know it seems like oh my god he's
156:10 - doing so much but it will make
156:11 - sense in a second right
156:13 - uh bonjour tech says you guys are great
156:14 - colors and are great humans nice family
156:17 - appreciate that dude thank you so much
156:19 - um
156:21 - this would be dope next video teaching
156:24 - about coding and how to go by damn
156:25 - wouldn't that be fun more like melbourne
156:27 - bar
156:27 - going code and learn with me react from
156:29 - papa wrap from scratch so basically
156:30 - teaching up from scratch yeah
156:32 - i think that'll be fun honestly um rzo
156:35 - says you are the best program in the
156:36 - world thanks brother for this helpful
156:37 - information i appreciate that dude
156:39 - um i'm glad you're enjoying the stream
156:41 - all right so now what we're going to do
156:43 - is we're actually going to go ahead and
156:45 - have the email so
156:47 - uh the final piece right here so i'm
156:49 - going to actually go ahead and say
156:50 - we're going to test it right now right
156:52 - so if we if this works
156:54 - right this is where it gets tense right
156:57 - if this works right so i haven't
156:59 - actually gone ahead and sort of checked
157:01 - everything out but if this next bit
157:03 - works
157:03 - i want everyone to smash the thumbs up
157:06 - button and get this video to 700 likes
157:08 - all right
157:09 - so i think what we need to do is uh we
157:12 - need to go ahead and get ready for this
157:13 - right because i'm gonna pretty much i
157:14 - haven't tested this
157:15 - i'm just gonna go ahead and see if it
157:16 - works in one go we change so much code
157:18 - right now
157:19 - and i think it's gonna work right i
157:22 - think it's gonna work but
157:23 - you know how these things happen all
157:25 - right so i'm gonna go to message
157:27 - i'm signed in right and then we're gonna
157:30 - go ahead and say
157:31 - yo this works
157:34 - you think dot dot dot all right so
157:36 - suspense right
157:38 - everything's gonna happen as soon as i
157:39 - hit enter on this is it gonna work
157:42 - right all right
157:47 - see how it goes albiola says the best
157:50 - programmer i have ever seen
157:52 - jay goes let's go ottawa's already
157:54 - coming in with the suspense music
157:56 - right i think we can do it i'm going to
157:59 - hit enter
158:01 - and we can see if it's going to work
158:04 - hey
158:05 - [Music]
158:07 - see what
158:10 - and look at that guys it pulled my
158:12 - picture in
158:14 - and it pulled the message in even has a
158:16 - correct time stamp
158:18 - right so that's pretty sick right
158:20 - everything works like that
158:22 - and now if i go ahead and just say like
158:24 - abc one two three
158:26 - that's that boom works nice right so
158:29 - that's though
158:30 - we've got everything working i think we
158:32 - should all go ahead and hit that thumbs
158:34 - up if you haven't already
158:35 - alright again i think we're gonna hit
158:36 - 700 very soon so that's
158:38 - dope guys now what we're gonna do is
158:41 - actually have it so that if you're the
158:42 - sender
158:44 - then it's gonna go ahead and make it
158:45 - that blue message so it's gonna be like
158:47 - this
158:47 - right if you're the sender it's gonna
158:49 - show you a blue message
158:50 - um so we're gonna go ahead and do that
158:54 - right now so inside of
158:55 - message dot css i'm going to go ahead
158:59 - and add the following logic so right now
159:01 - we have message over here so i'm going
159:02 - to create this into
159:04 - a more i'm going to do string
159:06 - interpolation here
159:07 - i'm going to say if the user.email
159:12 - so i need to go ahead and actually pull
159:13 - the user in so i need to say const
159:15 - user equals use selector
159:22 - select user all right
159:29 - um yeah yeah
159:32 - and then what we're going to say now is
159:34 - we're going to say user if the user's
159:36 - email
159:37 - is equal to the email address that comes
159:40 - in
159:41 - i change it to the other music because
159:42 - it's easier to focus with that one all
159:44 - right
159:44 - then we're going to go ahead and have uh
159:47 - yeah so this is
159:48 - no the question mark is if else
159:52 - that's if else what we're about to use
159:54 - right now but the question mark down
159:55 - here
159:56 - um is actually saying optional chaining
159:58 - so if this for any reason is undefined
160:01 - it doesn't crash the program it just
160:03 - handles it uh elegantly
160:05 - so it's coming something called optional
160:06 - chaining very very elegant solution to
160:08 - use
160:09 - um but here what we're going to do is
160:10 - we're actually using we're using tannery
160:12 - here
160:12 - so actually we're not going to use
160:13 - tennis we're going to use a direct right
160:15 - but with the ternary you can say if it's
160:17 - true
160:17 - then say this else say this
160:21 - right so that's the ternary but what
160:23 - we're going to do is we're going to do a
160:24 - direct sort of
160:25 - conditional so we're going to say here
160:28 - apply the message
160:31 - sender class if the user's email is
160:34 - equal to the email of the message right
160:36 - go ahead and save that
160:38 - and let's go ahead and refresh some
160:41 - reason that's not refreshing there we go
160:42 - and now if i go ahead and click into
160:44 - this for example the youtube chat it
160:46 - loads up the youtube message and if i go
160:47 - ahead and say
160:48 - this is a test now you guys can also see
160:50 - if i go into different channels it pulls
160:52 - those messages
160:54 - which is dope right so let's go into
160:57 - message.css hey we got ecuador in the
161:01 - house nice
161:02 - sup dude and then here what we're gonna
161:05 - say
161:06 - is i'm gonna add a few style tricks in
161:08 - so what i'm gonna first say
161:09 - is that if the message sender if the
161:11 - message
161:13 - sender class exists set the margin all
161:16 - the way to the right
161:18 - right then what we're going to say is
161:21 - that if the message sender
161:23 - is existing what i'm going to do is i'm
161:25 - going to target the message photo and
161:27 - i'm going to use a rule called order one
161:29 - and this is basically going to change
161:30 - the flex
161:31 - order of the children so the image will
161:34 - now go
161:35 - ahead of the child so in this case if i
161:38 - do that
161:39 - and i say message photo by default is
161:42 - message is order zero
161:44 - what this will do is
161:48 - if we want to get this effect right so
161:50 - we have the message on this side
161:52 - and the message on here so the way we do
161:54 - that is i can refresh
161:56 - we actually haven't set something up
161:57 - correctly here so
161:59 - we've got the message sender then we
162:02 - need to do
162:03 - a message photo because inside of here i
162:07 - haven't done a class name
162:09 - of message
162:12 - photo now if we do that and refresh
162:17 - boom works there we go
162:20 - all right so now it's the sender and
162:22 - also i'm going to change the color of
162:24 - the
162:24 - message sender so i'm going to go ahead
162:27 - and do this
162:28 - oh we almost we're 10 likes away from
162:30 - 700 likes guys let's go come on we can
162:32 - do this
162:33 - right so we're going to go ahead and
162:34 - target the message sender p tag and
162:36 - we're going to say if you're a sender
162:37 - then it
162:38 - turns blue so now it does this right so
162:41 - i'm going to test this i'm going to log
162:42 - out of my account go into sign in
162:44 - and i'm going to go ahead and check now
162:46 - i'm going to go into qazi's account and
162:48 - let's go ahead and see
162:50 - and if i go here now so that now i'm not
162:52 - the sender because it's not kazzy's
162:53 - email address but if i go into
162:55 - here and i say like what's up guys
163:00 - enter boom so now the sender is going to
163:03 - get the blue message but
163:04 - somebody else is going to have not have
163:06 - it right 5 legs away
163:08 - let's go um dope right so that works
163:11 - really good
163:12 - okay now the next step and the final
163:14 - step
163:15 - is actually going ahead and adding two
163:17 - things one adding the animations which
163:19 - will be very quick
163:20 - and two uh i thought because if we do
163:23 - not have seven hundred maybe
163:24 - we'll attack sunny goddammit help me out
163:26 - guys get four more likes and get hashtag
163:28 - fancy dinner going
163:29 - you know um so what we're gonna do now
163:32 - is also have
163:33 - the message come up here right inside
163:35 - our chat so in order to do that
163:37 - what we need to do is go into our
163:39 - sidebar chat
163:41 - and we have the um
163:45 - i need to create a piece of state and
163:47 - this is going to be the information that
163:48 - we're going to show here so i'm gonna
163:50 - call it
163:50 - uh chat info okay so i need to go ahead
163:52 - and import this
163:54 - um and there we go and then what i'm
163:57 - gonna go ahead and do is

167:35 - ahead and do this so i'm going to
167:36 - include
167:38 - some i'm going to say new chat info 0
167:41 - timestamp
167:42 - today and then we're going to pass it
167:44 - now you can see guys look at this
167:45 - if i go ahead and change it to like one
167:47 - two three boom
167:49 - one two three has the latest time stamp
167:52 - and and then the one thing we need to
167:53 - fix is the avatar right so the source
167:55 - for the avatar
167:56 - i'm going to go ahead and do the same
167:57 - thing i'm going to say here it's going
167:59 - to be chat info 0
168:00 - and we're doing optional change to
168:02 - protect against the break
168:04 - and then now we should see
168:08 - so kazi was the last one that sent the
168:10 - message here and then i was the last one
168:12 - that sent a message here which is why my
168:13 - picture but if i say
168:15 - yo i'm taking over i'm taking over the
168:18 - sidebar
168:19 - boom there you go nice cause it's richer
168:22 - all right so that's dope that's amazing
168:25 - it's working as we want it right
168:27 - so what we're gonna do now is have some
168:28 - fancy animations in so the way we can do
168:31 - that
168:31 - is um uh somebody says so something can
168:35 - you pause the music when you do live
168:36 - streams it kind of kills about i
168:37 - i really i don't know man i really enjoy
168:39 - the vibe uh the the music and i think
168:41 - loads of people actually enjoy the music
168:43 - so
168:43 - i kind of go based off of what
168:45 - everyone's enjoying what everyone's
168:46 - feeling you know
168:47 - that sort of stuff um
168:50 - my girlfriend just texted me saying they
168:51 - want me in the vid hell yeah we're gonna
168:53 - bring you in the vid
168:54 - um so now what we're to do is we're
168:57 - going to go ahead and actually add the
168:59 - animations in so you can see
169:01 - right now um so right now see
169:05 - this is the final finishing touch this
169:07 - nice little animation right here okay
169:09 - amazing donation thank you so much
169:11 - shashank he says what cp doing is
169:12 - amazing thank you guys
169:14 - thank you so much brother for that
169:15 - donation i appreciate you
169:17 - also if i go ahead and type in here say
169:18 - hello you see that it kind of pops in in
169:21 - a very nice animated fashion so in order
169:23 - to do that
169:25 - what we're gonna do now is yeah so these
169:27 - t spoilers like no
169:28 - don't don't kill the music i say i'm
169:30 - gonna kill it dude don't worry
169:31 - uh so i'm gonna add something called
169:33 - react flip move so i'm gonna go ahead
169:34 - and say react flip move
169:36 - and i'm gonna go here to effortless
169:38 - animation and i'm going to show you guys
169:39 - how to implement
169:40 - very easy animations right so we need to
169:42 - go ahead and install it
169:44 - so i'm going to go in to bring up the
169:45 - terminology npm i react flip move
169:48 - um you don't need the dash s anymore and
169:51 - then what i'm going to say
169:52 - is we're going to go down here and you
169:53 - see there's a good documentation for
169:55 - this
169:55 - but all we need to do essentially is add
169:57 - a forward ref
169:58 - to our message that's the first thing so
170:00 - i'm going to go to my message
170:02 - and i'm going to change this function to
170:04 - an es6 function first i'm going to say
170:06 - const message
170:07 - equals and i'm changing this to an arrow
170:09 - function so it's the same thing but it's
170:11 - just written in the es6 way so this is
170:13 - the es6
170:14 - way of writing a function okay and then
170:17 - what we're going to do is
170:19 - here's his mouth says play some 690 can
170:21 - you imagine trying to
170:23 - go to that that'd be tricky man all
170:25 - right so i'm going to go ahead and add
170:27 - forward ref
170:27 - and then i'm going to go ahead and do
170:29 - parentheses go all the way down here and
170:31 - add the closing parenthesis
170:33 - and then you've got the after the
170:36 - destructuring i'm going to do comma
170:38 - and i'm going to pull a ref out of it
170:40 - right
170:41 - and then what what that means is we pull
170:43 - the ref away
170:44 - from this bit and then we go into our
170:47 - div
170:48 - and we basically say ref equals ref now
170:50 - as for what this does you don't need to
170:52 - say i'm going to explain what forward
170:53 - ref
170:53 - is at this point but you need to import
170:55 - it um
170:57 - this is pretty much gonna it's gonna
170:59 - allow your your sort of
171:00 - just think of it this way it's gonna
171:01 - allow your functional components to be
171:03 - able to communicate
171:04 - the way that they need to for the
171:05 - animation to play correctly okay
171:07 - that's all we need to know at this point
171:09 - so that's successfully installed uh we
171:11 - don't need that anyway
171:13 - then we're gonna go back to our chat.js
171:15 - and where we render out the messages
171:17 - all we need to do is wrap this entire
171:19 - div inside of
171:20 - the flip move so flip move
171:27 - component because now we've done that
171:29 - correctly so it's going to freak out and
171:32 - i'm going to go back here and you see
171:34 - it's saying right flip move is not fine
171:36 - so i need to import react flip move
171:40 - react flip move i'm going to go ahead
171:42 - and import that react flip move from
171:44 - react flip move
171:45 - and now guys check this out
171:48 - boom animations you need keys
171:52 - though you need keys in your messages
171:53 - otherwise it messes this entire thing up
171:56 - it doesn't know which is what then but
171:57 - now if i go inside and say hello
171:59 - boom check that out guys yo it works
172:03 - look how smooth that is
172:05 - that's dope i just want to check if my
172:07 - overflow is fixed
172:09 - so i'm just going to do say abc and i'm
172:11 - going to copy this a bunch of times
172:12 - let's do abc oh okay i guess we could do
172:15 - an important reaction
172:15 - move from here okay so you see this
172:17 - right now it breaks
172:19 - right there's no see overflow doesn't it
172:21 - doesn't work correctly right
172:23 - we don't want this to happen okay so how
172:26 - do we fix this overflow issue
172:28 - right so let's go ahead and fix this so
172:30 - let's go ahead and go to
172:32 - our chat.css and here what we want to do
172:36 - so inside of chat.css
172:40 - where we have chat messages i'm going to
172:42 - go ahead and firstly add overflow
172:44 - scroll okay now by adding that
172:47 - you can see we have actually already
172:49 - fixed a lot of the issue
172:51 - but i want to kind of hide the scroll
172:52 - bars right so in order to do that now
172:55 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to add
172:56 - these two snippets we've seen them
172:57 - before i'm reusing them here
172:59 - so these two the first one does it for
173:00 - chrome safari and oprah the second one
173:02 - does it for internet explorer edge and
173:03 - firefox
173:04 - um but it basically removes the look and
173:07 - feel so if i go ahead and save it
173:09 - it removes the look and feel but it
173:11 - actually keeps the functionality
173:12 - of the scroll bar okay so that's dope
173:15 - and it works really really nice really
173:17 - really well so
173:19 - with that said now what we're going to
173:20 - go ahead and do is
173:23 - um
173:26 - so if you want to go ahead and make it
173:27 - to time ago i would recommend this go
173:30 - ahead and extend on it but you can
173:31 - pretty much use the
173:32 - moment or time ago library um that's
173:35 - going to be something pretty cool
173:37 - um we can actually go ahead and just
173:38 - check quickly i think it's time ago
173:40 - uh jess just
173:43 - moment you get loads you get time ago.js
173:46 - this one's pretty decent i've used this
173:48 - one before um
173:50 - see you see this is just now four
173:52 - minutes ago things like that
173:54 - um should we just quickly do let's just
173:57 - do it go on then
173:58 - let's do it i'm gonna do npm install
174:02 - timeago.js
174:03 - and then let's go ahead and see how you
174:05 - can do it so
174:06 - import all as time ago and then let's go
174:10 - ahead and check out how we use it so i
174:11 - haven't used this in a while so it'll be
174:12 - interesting
174:13 - so sidebar
174:17 - sidebar chat
174:20 - and then we have where we have the
174:23 - timestamps over here
174:24 - what i'm going to do is
174:27 - i'm going to go ahead and say import at
174:29 - the top
174:31 - import all from time ago at some time
174:33 - ago suggest you can also do a moment i
174:35 - think so i'm just using
174:36 - the quick one that i saw but you can do
174:38 - it moment moments really good one two at
174:40 - some moment
174:41 - that's what we're gonna do time ago um
174:43 - dot
174:44 - format oops i'm gonna format
174:48 - i'm gonna basically pop this in now i'm
174:50 - not sure if that will work
174:51 - just like that pretty much go ahead and
174:53 - see so look at that four weeks ago okay
174:55 - that's not right
174:56 - um it hasn't done that right so if i go
174:59 - to to
175:00 - locale string let's go ahead and see if
175:02 - this one works
175:03 - oh there we go nice look at that two
175:05 - minutes ago
175:06 - if i go ahead and say yo boom just now
175:10 - fast though dude that's sick
175:14 - we got that working pretty quick and now
175:16 - this one says six minutes ago
175:17 - if i go ahead and said uh when was this
175:21 - pushed just now
175:24 - right and that's sick and that would
175:26 - change um
175:28 - as and when sort of like the timings
175:30 - change and things like that
175:31 - um i think uh moment is actually a lot
175:34 - better
175:34 - i think i would use a moment um
175:37 - but yeah you can pretty much use
175:39 - whatever you decide to do because you
175:40 - see now this one doesn't actually
175:41 - refresh
175:43 - in real time but i mean it's not bad
175:44 - like isn't this actually not bad like
175:46 - um but i would like the one that does
175:48 - dynamics so i would actually go
175:49 - recommend
175:50 - uh time ago moment.js
175:54 - moment.js i think i prefer moment.js um
175:59 - they have a much better way of doing it
176:02 - at a moment.js so i think it's
176:05 - from now yeah you see from now is the
176:08 - one that i would have used
176:09 - preferably but it's fine yeah um
176:13 - so yeah so this one the reason why i've
176:14 - done this guys and had it reversed like
176:17 - this
176:17 - is because you need to have a listener
176:19 - then which scrolls to the bottom always
176:21 - so i'm not going to do that today
176:22 - otherwise it's just a little bit
176:23 - unnecessary extra work i want to show
176:25 - you the deployment instead so we can
176:26 - prioritize that
176:27 - right what i would say is you can pretty
176:29 - much go ahead and just
176:30 - if you want to do that you go to chat.js
176:33 - and you literally just change it to
176:35 - um ascending firstly and then you have
176:38 - it so that
176:39 - you always have a scroll listener
176:42 - so every time the user sends a message
176:45 - it will scroll to the bottom
176:47 - as that way it kind of locks to the
176:48 - bottom every time you send a message
176:49 - that's what that's how you do that by
176:51 - the way
176:52 - um so yeah um so now what we're going to
176:55 - do
176:56 - is i'm going to go ahead and say
176:57 - firebase init right
176:59 - so in order to do this you need to have
177:01 - firebase setup so firebase tools so you
177:02 - might need to globally install firebase
177:04 - tools
177:04 - but what i'm going to do now is go ahead
177:06 - and do firebase init and i'm going to
177:08 - spacebar on hosting and then i'm going
177:10 - to use an existing project
177:12 - right so i'm going to go ahead and find
177:14 - the build that i've done so you see
177:15 - we have so many builds and imessage
177:17 - clone youtube
177:18 - hit that and what then what you want to
177:20 - go ahead and do is go ahead and do oops
177:23 - go ahead and do
177:24 - public directory i'm going to say build
177:26 - right so not you don't care enter you
177:28 - has to be
177:29 - build all right build is very important
177:31 - here and then once we do this we're
177:32 - going to click
177:32 - y because it's a single page app every
177:35 - react app is a single page app
177:37 - then what we need to do is say npm run
177:39 - build so now we're going to deploy this
177:40 - live right so npm run build
177:42 - and then i'm going to basically go ahead
177:44 - so that's good if i run that it
177:45 - basically creates an optimized
177:47 - production build
177:48 - okay optimize production build and that
177:51 - will go ahead and make it very very fast
177:53 - and sort of and it'll be very very nice
177:55 - and easy to go ahead and do that
177:57 - so um optimized production build is
178:00 - gonna get so it strips out all the
178:02 - things that dev devtools the things that
178:03 - you don't need
178:04 - on the deployed version of the website
178:09 - that's what happens when you when you
178:10 - use this okay so you need to go ahead
178:12 - and do this and now it's important to
178:13 - know whenever you do npm run build if
178:15 - you make any changes
178:16 - after you're gonna need to go ahead and
178:18 - do npm run build again to get the
178:19 - optimized build
178:20 - now checking inside of our build folder
178:23 - so as we now
178:24 - should see a build photo with all the
178:26 - stuff inside of it you don't want to
178:27 - ever touch the build folder
178:29 - the command line builds everything for
178:30 - you and puts it inside of that
178:32 - but what we want to do now is say
178:34 - firebase
178:35 - deploy if it's not a single page we can
178:38 - use hash router and deploy you don't
178:39 - even need to use that you can just react
178:41 - router
178:41 - to make it multiple pages so a lot of
178:43 - the builds including the amazon clone on
178:45 - the react
178:46 - challenge if you use a react route or
178:48 - inside that we use reactor inside that
178:49 - build to
178:50 - have multiple pages inside the app that
178:52 - will do it
178:53 - but here you can say firebase deploy and
178:56 - guys
178:56 - who is ready to deploy this thing if
178:58 - you're ready let me know
179:00 - uh we've pretty much got this thing
179:01 - built but i want to go ahead and have
179:03 - everyone jump on this app
179:05 - and get this thing deployed and up and
179:08 - running so let me know in the comments
179:09 - if you are
179:10 - excited and if you are and you haven't
179:13 - already done so
179:14 - smash the thumbs up on button and let me
179:16 - know if i should hit this deployment
179:17 - button
179:18 - okay so let me know right now my finger
179:20 - is here right all i have to do is let
179:22 - you just drop
179:23 - and we can pretty much go ahead and
179:24 - deploy this thing
179:26 - live and it's so fast i'm going to drop
179:28 - that in the chat and everyone's going to
179:29 - go ahead and be able to use this
179:32 - and go ahead and see the real-time
179:34 - functionality of this right
179:35 - so we have a miracle says let's go uh
179:38 - jay says get that fire build online so
179:40 - we can experience it pranav says ready

179:57 - and you can see it's pretty much going
179:59 - to go ahead and spin it up so it's
180:00 - deploying hosting
