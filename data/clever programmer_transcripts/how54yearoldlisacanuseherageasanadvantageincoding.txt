00:04 - okay lisa says 54 question mark Kazi i
00:09 - am 54 in other videos you said to get on
00:12 - youtube i don't want to or make any
00:14 - udemy videos can you still make a living
00:17 - coding and am I too old okay Lisa this
00:22 - is a very good question that you have
00:24 - you said I'm 54
00:26 - I'm worried first of all am I too old
00:29 - that's one of your concerns and then
00:32 - also you mentioned that you don't want
00:35 - to get in front of a camera and you
00:36 - don't want to create content or whatever
00:38 - okay great
00:40 - not everybody wants to create content
00:42 - not everybody wants to do videos I
00:44 - totally get it
00:45 - 99% of the developers actually even more
00:48 - and none of them do any of that okay and
00:51 - you don't have to it's possible for you
00:54 - to get jobs it's possible for you to get
00:56 - work without any of those things keep in
00:58 - mind guys that I got my first job in 3
01:03 - months of learning to code okay wasn't
01:05 - some amazing thing that happened there
01:07 - are a few things and I always talk about
01:09 - them you know in my emails I talked
01:14 - about it last livestream if you missed
01:16 - it
01:16 - go watch it and I'm gonna be talking
01:18 - about it over the next coming weeks I
01:21 - have some amazing things put together
01:22 - for you guys like this masterclass where
01:25 - i cover a lot but to answer Lisa's
01:29 - question you're not too old because
01:33 - you're gonna be 55 regardless of what
01:37 - happens in your life right you're 54
01:38 - right now you're gonna be 55 somebody
01:40 - who's 55 is gonna be 56 regardless of
01:44 - what happens the question is do you want
01:46 - to be 55 exactly how you are right now
01:49 - or do you want to be 55 with a new skill
01:53 - added on okay so that's kind of really
01:55 - what it is and for you to get some kind
01:59 - of result in 3 to 6 months or maybe even
02:01 - a year let's say it takes you a year
02:03 - that's not that long of a time okay it's
02:07 - still happening within that time
02:09 - for if you're whether if you're too old
02:11 - I have also made a special video on this
02:14 - which is called am I too old to start
02:17 - coding and how that video kind of came
02:21 - about was this one person one of my
02:24 - students she said her name was Catherine
02:28 - and she said that she was I think
02:30 - forty-five years old she had three kids
02:33 - had a full-time job had a husband and
02:38 - she finds it very difficult that out of
02:42 - that all of that stuff she gets any like
02:45 - getting any time to code but she was
02:47 - still finding two to three hours to code
02:49 - every single day and then improving one
02:54 - route to go is spend a lot of time and
02:56 - just work with hours and that's usually
02:59 - what I say is like the theoretical route
03:01 - where you can just spend a lot of time
03:03 - coding and building those skills but
03:06 - here's another alternative route that I
03:09 - am a big fan of that I think is highly
03:12 - effective and this is something that
03:14 - came on came out in Carnegie Mellon
03:17 - Carnegie Mellon right that's the name of
03:20 - the university their study and they said
03:23 - 85% of your financial success comes from
03:28 - your likeability your personal skills
03:32 - your communication all right and so
03:38 - basically in other words to sum it up
03:39 - 85% of your success comes with your soft
03:42 - skills 15% of your success comes with
03:46 - technical skills so here's the awesome
03:49 - part as a 54 year old you have all this
03:54 - experience that you've gained in your
03:56 - life that will be helping you unlike
03:59 - somebody who was 20 when they were
04:00 - starting okay so maybe being younger it
04:03 - can even be a disadvantage at certain
04:05 - times okay it can be advantage in other
04:07 - ways where we have maybe more time to
04:09 - invest maybe more energy maybe more
04:11 - passion and motivation but what you have
04:15 - is a lot of references throughout your
04:17 - life you can use those okay to get a
04:22 - jump start
04:23 - and you only have to know actually a
04:24 - little bit of coding what I would have
04:27 - you spend your time on is learn how to
04:30 - do practical things that solve people's
04:32 - problems
04:33 - don't just be doing those coding
04:36 - exercises that are super complicated and
04:38 - require all this crazy math
