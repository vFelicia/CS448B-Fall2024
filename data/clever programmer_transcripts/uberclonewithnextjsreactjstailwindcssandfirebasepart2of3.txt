06:38 - everybody open up your vs code
06:41 - all right i'll close up my slides

06:48 - right let's see where we left off
06:49 - everybody
06:51 - okay let's see where we left off so i'm
06:53 - gonna put my little link right here to
06:56 - the side so i can see it so so far what
06:58 - we have guys is what do we have we have
07:00 - this back button of course you can go
07:01 - back here
07:02 - hopefully no you cannot go back because
07:04 - remember your background was supposed to
07:05 - where you had to actually link it but
07:07 - you do have your home page
07:09 - which let's see which looks like this
07:10 - right
07:11 - we've got our map box we've got our map
07:13 - box you can go ahead and click on one of
07:15 - these buttons and go to the actual
07:18 - location and of course you're going to
07:19 - type in the location
07:21 - go somewhere as well that's the whole
07:24 - goal right and for homework i remember
07:26 - guys what was the whole what was the
07:27 - homework guys
07:28 - who remembers the homework i want to see
07:30 - in the chat i want to see it in the
07:31 - zoombo's the homework anybody remember
07:34 - what was the homework
07:36 - am i remember yes yes that's right
07:38 - that's right that's right
07:40 - so the homework was to create a button
07:44 - right here
07:46 - create a button
07:48 - create a button the confirm button right
07:49 - here right so confirm location
07:52 - and then link this button back to the
07:54 - homepage that's the goal right so we'll
07:56 - do the first and then after that we'll
07:58 - work on the confirm page guys
08:00 - all right so
08:01 - just really quick thing guys my throat
08:04 - is not feeling the best so if you
08:07 - you know just yeah no just be nice to me
08:08 - i don't know you know i'll try my best
08:10 - to be
08:11 - bring up as much energy as i possibly
08:13 - can but it's going to be a two hour bill
08:15 - probably
08:17 - so be nice
08:19 - okay
08:20 - and let's just do it okay so guys here's
08:22 - our project we have this is what we've
08:24 - got so far we've got our pages of course
08:27 - we've got our inside gs this is where we
08:29 - have what our header our everything
08:31 - right so we've got the the header the
08:33 - action buttons everything's pretty much
08:34 - good there we've got our search page
08:36 - that's what worked on the last time
08:38 - right so part one let's go ahead and
08:39 - make this
08:40 - uh let's do this i'm gonna create
08:42 - something called a new file and i'll
08:43 - call it plan.md
08:47 - okay which is like the first thing
08:49 - unbuilt so first part one is gonna be
08:51 - okay let's go ahead and link the what
08:54 - link the back button
08:57 - to go to the home page
08:59 - okay
09:01 - beautiful so link the whole back button
09:03 - to go to the home page and as you
09:05 - remember how do you link the back button
09:06 - right in order to link something it's
09:08 - not like your normal who can tell me for
09:10 - example maybe in zoom you can tell me
09:11 - guys how do we for example link
09:13 - something
09:14 - maybe you guys know here
09:17 - right how do you link something that's
09:18 - right using the link tag right it's not
09:20 - as simple as you would usually do so if
09:23 - we go to the search page we have a link
09:24 - tag actually here i believe yes i'm
09:27 - going to copy this link it's not your
09:28 - normal like href right in
09:31 - an extra yet that you have usually in
09:32 - html instead it's a link kind of
09:36 - container
09:37 - all right
09:38 - so i've got the link beautiful and then
09:40 - at that point in order to link the
09:42 - button where do we have to put it guys
09:43 - who can tell me
09:44 - who can tell me zooming youtube
09:47 - where do we put it
09:49 - we put it exactly yes we put it exactly
09:51 - where below the button container exactly
09:53 - well it's actually not below here well
09:56 - i mean i guess i guess you could say
09:57 - below the button that's right so we have
09:59 - here so link
10:03 - link right here
10:05 - and of course i have to close it out at
10:06 - this point
10:12 - now and of course that's going to be our
10:14 - link and now i have to add a
10:16 - shrap we have to save it okay now who
10:19 - can tell me
10:21 - who can tell me
10:23 - what what in terms of here right
10:26 - which link right do we put in there
10:29 - do we just put a lot of you guys put
10:31 - this
10:32 - index
10:33 - a lot of you guys did this one that's
10:35 - right a lot of you guys did this one
10:36 - that's not how you do it so let's go and
10:38 - test it out if i click on here
10:40 - it's not it's undefined right you see it
10:41 - will actually give you an error there's
10:43 - no such thing as index even though it
10:45 - isn't an innocent yes i can see where
10:46 - you guys get that from but in order to
10:48 - go to the homepage you have to do slash
10:51 - that's right um nas yes
10:53 - um on the youtube stream you might have
10:56 - to move the
10:57 - zoom thing when you see during share
11:00 - screen it may be to the other screen
11:02 - and also the ecam thing on zoom
11:06 - at the bottom
11:07 - i got like 10 different screens
11:09 - thank you
11:12 - it's okay
11:14 - all right so
11:17 - i got everything i got literally if you
11:19 - guys you guys should see my screen it's
11:20 - pretty crazy it's all right so we have
11:22 - our link right here let's go and save
11:24 - that okay uh let's go back to the home
11:26 - homepage to see where we're at
11:29 - okay
11:30 - let's click on the right section all
11:32 - right and let's see if i click on this
11:35 - boom right it's got it goes back to the
11:38 - homepage so hopefully you guys got that
11:39 - right
11:41 - that's right we're live anything can
11:42 - happen here that's exactly it right so
11:45 - so now the back button works i can mark
11:48 - that as i kind of done right so that's
11:50 - all done
11:51 - the one thing i will say though however
11:54 - well can i even do like a check mark
11:57 - oh beautiful guys i'm loving this i'm
11:59 - loving this okay now
12:01 - the one less thing gonna do is you know
12:03 - how i when i
12:04 - hover over this button i kind of want it
12:06 - to be like a cursor because right now it
12:07 - doesn't feel like it's you want to be
12:09 - clicked on so
12:11 - instead
12:12 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
12:14 - make it a cursor kind of pointer so
12:16 - let's see here let's go to search page
12:18 - our but our
12:20 - back button right here and i will say
12:22 - cursor pointer
12:24 - why because then we got the hand gesture
12:26 - right it's like when you hover over a
12:28 - link you know it your pointer goes from
12:30 - like a normal pointer like this like a
12:32 - hand gesture pointer that's what our
12:34 - goal is here so save that
12:36 - oh you see so it's a lot better it feels
12:38 - a lot different so like even though even
12:41 - such a small thing
12:42 - once you agree with me on that one if
12:43 - such a small thing just makes it a lot
12:46 - feel a lot better right
12:47 - right
12:49 - and that's it
12:50 - okay that's part one done next part
12:53 - let's go and confirm the create the
12:54 - confirm locations uh button right so
12:57 - next portion is part two
13:01 - create the confirm
13:04 - locations button
13:08 - beautiful
13:10 - confirm locations button all right
13:14 - all right so confirm locations button
13:16 - now to make this one work of course we
13:19 - have to create a container all right so
13:21 - it's going to create our uh container
13:22 - for the confirm container
13:26 - so confirm button the container right
13:27 - underneath this input uh i'm actually
13:29 - not underneath this where is it as it
13:31 - was or was it the search and i need to
13:34 - save places my bad
13:36 - let's go ahead and do confirm
13:39 - confirm i want to say button container
13:43 - button container again that's guys
13:45 - that's in the search dot js just so you
13:47 - know insert the gs and we'll create this
13:49 - confirm button container which if you
13:51 - don't know it looks a little bit like
13:52 - this
13:53 - boom right so that's where our goal is
13:55 - right now
13:56 - got it beautiful all right so go for run
13:59 - the container
14:00 - fold out the tag inside here when i say
14:02 - confirm locations
14:05 - all right save that okay and of course
14:08 - let's go and create the actual uh div
14:11 - who knows how to create that guys in the
14:13 - zoom how do we create the actual dig
14:15 - using tail and css style components who
14:18 - can tell me
14:19 - you could tell me
14:20 - i'll shout you out if you tell me i'll
14:22 - shout you out you tell me let me see
14:25 - hey hey man got it and amarik as well
14:28 - good job guys good job good job so let's
14:30 - do
14:31 - const
14:33 - i'm gonna say confirm button container
14:38 - dab with that div
14:40 - beautiful
14:41 - right and so far it's kind of nothing
14:43 - right let's go so let's go see what we
14:44 - got it's it's pretty it's pretty blend
14:47 - right so that's okay so we're gonna do
14:49 - is at this point
14:51 - is is the following so let's say bg dash
14:54 - black to give it a back color black
14:55 - color okay
14:57 - now to make the text white we'll do text
14:59 - dash white
15:01 - nice beautiful and then let's go and
15:04 - center this right so to do center we'll
15:06 - say text center
15:08 - okay so kind of kind of there you see
15:10 - i'm starting i'm literally using padding
15:13 - and margin to create this right so let's
15:15 - see to create okay let's create spacing
15:18 - between the actual the button and the
15:20 - top portion what do you do who can tell
15:22 - me i'll show you how is it margin or is
15:24 - it the padding section who can tell me
15:27 - is it margin or is the padding one
15:30 - which one is it it is no it's actually
15:32 - the margin guys
15:34 - so it's above the actual thing right so
15:35 - to do because if i say padding it's
15:37 - padding within the actual black box if i
15:40 - do marginal hover it's margin outside
15:42 - the black box so i'll say margin top
15:45 - dash two
15:46 - see right there see that's it right
15:48 - there and i will say margin x that's on
15:51 - the x axis guys on the x
15:53 - that's gonna be let's see
15:55 - mx-what
15:57 - four
15:58 - nice right there okay to make the button
16:01 - bigger now we need to create spacing on
16:03 - the inside now which one do we use do we
16:05 - use the margin or the padding which one
16:08 - okay tell me yes that's right d padding
16:10 - so let's go now inside here we'll say
16:13 - p x dash four
16:16 - okay i mean p axis doesn't really matter
16:18 - too much but p y however which is the
16:20 - vertical axis dash three
16:23 - hey you see now feels like a button
16:26 - beautiful let's go ahead and make the
16:28 - text a little bit larger so we'll say
16:29 - text let me go ahead and make this so
16:30 - you guys you guys don't need to see this
16:32 - person honestly
16:33 - text
16:34 - dash to excel
16:36 - beautiful right so now it's a little bit
16:37 - bigger and then of course to make this
16:39 - button feel like it's clickable we say
16:41 - what who could tell me we do what
16:44 - make you feel like it's clickable tell
16:45 - me tell me tell me
16:49 - that's right cursor pointer
16:51 - that's right i mean it's a cool name and
16:54 - benjamin as well nice job benjamin
16:59 - okay so now however this cursor pointer
17:01 - sweet okay so we got that portion guys
17:03 - okay so we've got the back button
17:05 - done
17:06 - from locations button done so let's go
17:08 - ahead and mark that complete
17:10 - right
17:11 - so that is
17:13 - boom
17:14 - next on type three
17:16 - the next thing we need to do is now we
17:17 - need to go ahead and create a confirm
17:20 - page okay so create a confirm page
17:22 - because the next because after this
17:24 - point this is the actual thing that's
17:26 - already complete already if i go to here
17:29 - boom this is our confirm page right so
17:31 - we need to go ahead and create this page
17:32 - at this point you guys can see that if i
17:34 - hover this right here it says confirm in
17:37 - there got it
17:39 - so to get a confirm page what should be
17:41 - the name of our file who knows
17:43 - who knows
17:45 - who knows
17:47 - i should know that's right
17:48 - that's right devin dublin that's right
17:50 - you should be confirmed.js let's go and
17:52 - do that right now
17:53 - right click new file on the pages say
17:55 - confirm.js
18:00 - we got the special little thing about
18:02 - call rafc e that's my special my special
18:05 - think about i like to call it right r a
18:08 - f c e there we go right it stands for
18:11 - react arrow function component if you
18:14 - did not know that's right react arrow
18:16 - here i'll write it out for you
18:19 - react even if you read about this
18:22 - react
18:23 - arrow
18:25 - function
18:26 - oh come on no
18:28 - function component
18:32 - and i'll just create it for you right
18:33 - this is the base arrow react or function
18:35 - component got it beautiful
18:38 - okay we're going to import the same
18:40 - stuff usually import guys the tailwind
18:42 - stuff okay let's go and do copy pasta
18:44 - for the tailwind so i'm gonna miss a gs
18:47 - i'll go back to my confirm the gs i will
18:49 - pasta this one
18:51 - okay nice nice nice guys
18:56 - good and now we can create this as a
18:57 - wrapper
19:01 - beautiful
19:02 - a nice job
19:05 - nice job
19:08 - beautiful yeah as you guys know how do
19:09 - we create this rapper using taylor's css
19:11 - who can tell me
19:12 - what is it five four three two one yes
19:16 - anthony that's right so we do const
19:18 - rapper
19:19 - is equal to what ah t w dot do
19:25 - and i say here
19:27 - good job anthony
19:31 - hey let's go as
19:33 - long of course a lot of you guys said it
19:35 - too as well so
19:37 - we got that let's go and save it and
19:39 - let's see what we got okay if i
19:42 - i had this search functionality all cool
19:44 - but then if i go to confirm you guys can
19:46 - see i'm currently right here you guys
19:48 - are not i'm curious
19:50 - arrow boom i'm currently right here
19:52 - if i go ahead and i change this to be
19:54 - now confirmed
19:59 - confirm what we got
20:01 - hey we got nothing
20:03 - it's okay let's go ahead and actually
20:04 - add some text so confirm page
20:07 - beautiful
20:08 - let's see hopefully shows up yes we got
20:11 - it it shows up right there my friends
20:14 - right that's good good good good good
20:16 - beautiful
20:17 - so now okay um the confirm page is all
20:20 - good the next thing i want to do is i
20:22 - want to go ahead and re add the map
20:24 - right because as you know there's two
20:26 - things we've got right what are the
20:28 - other two boxes that we go ahead and
20:30 - need to
20:31 - create
20:32 - with this what are the two boxes who
20:33 - knows well this box and then which box
20:36 - who can tell me youtube slash zoom
20:39 - which box which bunch which way do we do
20:41 - it which one which one there's one box
20:44 - and then there is
20:48 - the bottom box the quota that's right
20:50 - the bottom box this one right there's
20:52 - two divs one
20:54 - and then dos
20:55 - that's right so
20:57 - let's go ahead and do and actually
20:58 - create those boxes okay
21:00 - we've got the map so if you know right
21:04 - we create a map as a component that's
21:05 - the cool part about components in extra
21:07 - yes right
21:08 - we create this map component right that
21:11 - simply just shows the map
21:12 - because it's a component we can actually
21:14 - reuse this guys we can actually reuse it
21:17 - multiple times so check it out
21:20 - i can just simply import it again so i
21:22 - say here import
21:24 - map boom see it automatically imports it
21:27 - right here
21:28 - right here okay
21:31 - and then i can actually just simply use
21:32 - it right here
21:33 - map
21:36 - boom let's see let's see if we get it
21:39 - let's see
21:40 - okay don't worry it's not showing up
21:41 - it's okay it's okay not in the world
21:43 - okay nothing in the world guys okay just
21:45 - stay awake stay with it still with me
21:47 - don't die still with me so
21:49 - the reason i start showing up is because
21:50 - of the height of the actual map right so
21:52 - we have the height is called flex 1
21:54 - but
21:55 - in order for flex 1 to work the parent
21:57 - container needs to be display flex and
21:59 - so we need to set the flex on the parent
22:01 - container
22:02 - and now check it out damn it's still not
22:04 - working it's okay it's okay it's okay
22:06 - okay it's okay let's see
22:09 - confirm page map should be flex one
22:13 - let's see let's see let's see
22:16 - maybe it doesn't like it for some reason
22:18 - it just doesn't like it
22:20 - it's taking a little while for it to
22:22 - load
22:22 - oh good
22:24 - oh i know why
22:26 - never mind right so flex that's why
22:27 - display flex but like we need to
22:29 - actually give this one that's
22:30 - such a simple one the wrapper actually
22:32 - right it's the height of it is like
22:34 - really small right now so if you think
22:35 - about this wrapper this one right here
22:37 - on the confirm page it's like this tiny
22:40 - it's a tiny tiny it's almost noticeable
22:42 - so you need to get the full height
22:43 - screen
22:44 - okay so let's do that so let's go ahead
22:46 - and do h
22:48 - dash screen
22:49 - yes nice job nice job
22:53 - hey there we go
22:56 - beautiful we've got that we've got
22:58 - ourselves a screen beautiful
23:01 - okay so
23:03 - that seems to be all good but now of
23:04 - course we need to create the second
23:05 - section which is which one the section
23:08 - on the bottom right here
23:09 - got it let's get the other section and
23:11 - i'm going to call this one the confirm
23:14 - right container yeah
23:16 - maybe okay how about you guys you tell
23:18 - me what should i call this maybe i'll
23:20 - give some input okay what should i call
23:22 - the bottom section you guys tell me
23:23 - which one
23:25 - which one
23:27 - the right container benjamin okay right
23:29 - container i like it so let's do it and
23:30 - do that
23:32 - so benjamin
23:34 - benjamin says right container okay
23:38 - so he says here right container
23:42 - boom okay
23:44 - good
23:45 - i know it's like
23:47 - i'm not anybody when you guys give me
23:49 - suggestions i'll just put your names on
23:50 - there i know it might make you feel
23:51 - great you know i think it's awesome so
23:54 - unless you guys don't want me to
23:55 - hopefully you guys do though
23:57 - all right so then we got right container
23:59 - and then
24:00 - at that point
24:02 - uh we've got what we have so let's do
24:05 - kind of do const
24:07 - right container
24:10 - beautiful equals two div right
24:14 - okay save it let's see we got we've got
24:16 - nothing we need to give it a specific
24:18 - height as we know that our map has a
24:21 - flex of one that means what that means
24:23 - what our right continues to have a flex
24:25 - of what you can tell me
24:26 - that's right ralph i need to get this
24:28 - reflexive one as well
24:33 - nice let's see
24:35 - oh what happened there what's going on
24:38 - i'm so curious what's going on there why
24:39 - is it who can tell me what do we do i'll
24:41 - put your name on there for now
24:43 - lex yes ralph flex wait no no ralph
24:46 - didn't get it hold on no no no
24:48 - devlin you got it nice job so what's
24:51 - that
24:52 - good job devlin
24:54 - okay
24:56 - okay i will say here flocks column
25:00 - let's see let's see let's see no not
25:03 - works not this one
25:04 - i know it's just not this one i know
25:06 - it's probably on the
25:08 - on the wrapper
25:10 - yes
25:12 - there we go hey you guys are better than
25:14 - me i'm telling you
25:15 - [Laughter]
25:17 - you guys are much better than me so
25:19 - there you go
25:21 - got two things got the map on the top
25:24 - the bottom section here now this box
25:26 - i'll just give it a a small thing like
25:28 - what should the bottom section have
25:29 - right let's go just put that in there
25:31 - the monster has the bottom section
25:33 - should have like a right selector i call
25:34 - it and a confirm button so let's just i
25:37 - want to add some text inside here that's
25:38 - it so i'm going to say right selector
25:44 - and a confirm button
25:47 - button done okay so let's see what we
25:49 - got
25:51 - hey beautiful so we've got those two
25:52 - things okay
25:54 - now let's go back to our plan
25:57 - oh we didn't even put up what the thing
25:58 - is but it's okay create the confirm page
26:02 - it's already done
26:03 - all right next one i want to do the
26:05 - following thing okay guys
26:06 - i want to part four i want to go ahead
26:09 - and actually create
26:10 - um i want to plot points like i want to
26:12 - i want to i want to add a point because
26:14 - if you think about it
26:16 - honest goal right if you look at for
26:18 - example our you know let me go back to
26:20 - my location here if i say santa monica
26:23 - santa monica
26:25 - and then i say here for example
26:28 - uh los angeles
26:32 - los angeles and i say confirm locations
26:33 - right we got these points that get
26:35 - plotted which is really cool by the way
26:36 - right which is really cool boom boom
26:38 - boom okay now
26:42 - of course but how do we plot these
26:44 - points do you guys want to find out yes
26:46 - or no
26:47 - do you guys want to find out i hope so
26:49 - yes yes yes can i get a thumbs up for
26:52 - that guys hit the thumbs up button if
26:54 - you're on youtube guys if you're on zoom
26:55 - actually i hear a suggestion go to
26:57 - youtube and just hit the thumbs up
26:58 - button i just it'll be much appreciated
27:00 - by us it gets more of the people you
27:02 - know helps us a lot tells us that you
27:04 - guys love it so we can do more of these
27:06 - challenges so let's get to a thousand
27:08 - likes i want to try to get as much as
27:09 - possible
27:10 - yes that's why i say i'm beautiful
27:12 - okay so now let's go ahead and figure
27:15 - out how do we plot points right so let's
27:17 - let's plot a random
27:19 - point
27:21 - on a what on a uh you know
27:24 - on a map
27:26 - that's our next thing and of course it's
27:28 - going to be inside you know the map
27:30 - section so we're going to use this we're
27:31 - going to do this inside the map section
27:33 - but to plot the random points
27:36 - it's not well
27:38 - i mean it can be a little difficult so
27:40 - let's see
27:41 - what i'm going to do the first things
27:42 - first is i'll go to the map.gs okay
27:44 - everybody go to method.gs right this is
27:46 - where we use the actual map okay
27:49 - and now at this point what i'm gonna do
27:50 - is
27:51 - i will go ahead and i will find a
27:53 - coordinate and i will say i will search
27:55 - up add
27:57 - marker
27:58 - marker to map in map box
28:04 - let's see add marker to map and map map
28:07 - box okay
28:10 - let's see so how do we do that
28:12 - add markers
28:15 - maybe they can see here let's see let's
28:17 - see let's see maybe maybe you can they
28:18 - can show it to us here where they we're
28:20 - going to tell us i want to show to you
28:22 - hey let's go
28:25 - right here so right here look right here
28:27 - see we have this marker so here it
28:29 - literally just shows it to you right
28:30 - there okay so what happens is that we
28:32 - create a marker so maybe i can zoom in
28:34 - on this for you
28:36 - oh i mean it's fine i think you guys can
28:38 - see this
28:40 - but right here so we have the marker
28:42 - right we create a marker using matbox.gl
28:45 - we set the lat long everybody knows that
28:47 - these are coordinates right so we're
28:48 - going to use coordinates right like
28:50 - launch the coordinates everybody got
28:52 - that give me a thumbs up yes good and
28:54 - then we added to the map
28:56 - okay the map is what is this map this
28:58 - map directly comes from here because
29:00 - that's where you initialized it
29:02 - that's right so we initialize our map
29:04 - right here and that's like what we need
29:06 - to do so i can literally just copy past
29:08 - this one okay copy pasta this one i can
29:10 - put it for you guys in the chat if you
29:11 - guys want
29:12 - okay
29:13 - there's my copy pasta for you all right
29:16 - and i'm gonna do it inside here so let's
29:18 - go ahead and try this
29:20 - boom smart marker
29:24 - oops that's not what i want so we have a
29:26 - new marker right here
29:28 - we set we set some random
29:30 - longitude
29:32 - okay and we add it to a map
29:35 - right here this is the map boom okay so
29:38 - let's see what actually adds it like we
29:39 - don't have to really do much more at
29:41 - this point right we don't have to really
29:42 - focus on this so if we go back to here
29:45 - okay let's see let's see this are you
29:46 - ready oh
29:49 - i don't know why is it there
29:51 - it's all the way in copenhagen
29:53 - anybody been been in copenhagen
29:56 - i don't really cope with hanging but i
29:57 - think it's pretty cool hopefully so
30:00 - so yeah so we got uh
30:02 - the marker first but now of course guys
30:05 - what we need to do is
30:07 - you know i like to create functions
30:09 - right i like to create functions to be
30:10 - able to what to like to add to the map
30:14 - right
30:15 - because we need to be able to add
30:16 - multiple coordinates to multiple
30:17 - location map
30:19 - so i'm going to put this into its own
30:20 - function i'll call the function called
30:22 - add to map
30:24 - so let's do this guys
30:26 - outside of use effect do const
30:29 - add to map
30:32 - is equal to a function
30:34 - boom
30:37 - okay good good good i'm literally just
30:39 - copy past this one put it into here
30:42 - right there
30:43 - okay now a few things to consider who
30:46 - can tell me what the parameters i need
30:48 - to pass in
30:50 - inside the function
30:52 - for this to work who can tell me
30:55 - what the problems need to pass in for
30:56 - this of work who can tell me
30:58 - i will go ahead and shout you out
31:00 - la long that's right is a shen
31:02 - yes shen
31:04 - that's right shin
31:06 - good
31:06 - and also who i can if you there's one
31:09 - specific one if you guys can get it i'll
31:10 - i'll definitely put your name on there
31:12 - there's one specific one not props
31:14 - benjamin no
31:15 - no
31:17 - no anybody
31:18 - address no ah well
31:21 - it's actually guys not that it's
31:23 - actually going to be the map we need to
31:24 - pass in the map because this map is
31:26 - inside the use effect right here you see
31:28 - this map and we also need to pass in
31:31 - into this function right here but good
31:33 - job here i'll give you guys some
31:34 - pointers
31:36 - good option
31:38 - okay
31:38 - so let's go ahead and do this
31:41 - i will say here add to map
31:43 - okay and i will pass in the map which is
31:46 - gonna come from where
31:47 - it's gonna come from directly from here
31:50 - into the here then from here directly
31:52 - into
31:53 - which we need to of course edit it to
31:55 - here so let's do that right now
31:57 - map
31:58 - good so that means it's good
32:01 - and let's see if that will still work
32:04 - let's see let's see let's see
32:06 - nice
32:07 - nice nice nice nice nice nice eye right
32:10 - so we've got that portion okay
32:13 - that's right that's right so we've got
32:14 - that portion we added to the map right
32:16 - here okay we have a specific function
32:18 - and again i like to i like to create
32:19 - that because of a few different
32:21 - different reasons oh benjamin said yeah
32:23 - all map that's right exactly
32:25 - so we've got
32:26 - that done let me go ahead and put that
32:28 - the white check mark
32:31 - next thing
32:32 - portion five i want to be able to
32:35 - actually plot points right the actual
32:38 - santa monica you know los angeles so
32:40 - points that we actually we we input
32:41 - right
32:42 - but before we plot points hook it down
32:44 - before we plot points like if i type in
32:47 - santa monica los angeles before we can
32:50 - plot them in
32:51 - what do we need who can tell me
32:54 - you can tell me we do what
32:58 - not a function no
32:59 - coordinates
33:01 - who said that
33:02 - fabio good job fario
33:04 - okay i want to go ahead and get
33:07 - coordinates right
33:09 - get coordinates
33:13 - from
33:15 - a location
33:16 - [Music]
33:18 - that's right
33:21 - good job fabio
33:25 - uh i'm not sure if i spell your name
33:27 - crafting good job so get coordinated
33:29 - from location okay so that's that's it
33:30 - right there
33:32 - okay so let's go ahead and see this
33:35 - how do we now get coordinates to be able
33:38 - to plot them for example like i say if i
33:40 - put santa monica how do we plot them
33:41 - here right that's that's probably not
33:43 - easy thing to do of course right but you
33:45 - know i mean we still have to do it guys
33:47 - right
33:48 - so to get coordinates it's we have to
33:51 - use map box as well map us allows us to
33:52 - do this so i want you guys to do is go
33:54 - to google
33:56 - google
33:57 - get coordinates
34:00 - coordinates from address
34:03 - okay
34:04 - we got the geo coding api right here
34:06 - beautiful beautiful
34:08 - and so we can do that but that's in
34:10 - developers i want to use mapbox actually
34:13 - i won't no not google
34:16 - map box
34:19 - boom
34:22 - that's right geocoding
34:24 - good let's see let's see if we're going
34:26 - to get closer to where we want to get to
34:29 - the main one we're going to use
34:31 - something called places that's right so
34:32 - it's called geocoding let me see
34:34 - geocoding uh map bucks you can api right
34:36 - here
34:39 - maybe i can show it to you um that's
34:41 - pretty dirty actually
34:43 - it's a pretty dirty way but here it is
34:45 - so
34:46 - to give some context here
34:48 - check this out you guys can see here
34:51 - that we have this api
34:53 - right
34:54 - it's called geocoding from mapbox.places
34:56 - and we can for example for example if we
34:58 - say los angeles here right this is this
35:00 - is the actual link right here everybody
35:01 - see that right there right this los
35:03 - angeles right there hopefully you guys
35:04 - can see that right if we put this in and
35:07 - we put a specific token inside here
35:10 - technically it will actually give us the
35:11 - coordinates so let's see it out let's
35:13 - try it out let's see what we can do here
35:14 - okay
35:16 - so
35:17 - get coordinates from
35:19 - from here so to do that we'll go back to
35:22 - confirm.js and we'll create a function
35:24 - guys
35:25 - okay
35:25 - const
35:27 - get coordinates
35:31 - is equal to something
35:35 - okay let's first let's create a random
35:37 - location so let's say const uh location
35:42 - const location just like a constant
35:43 - location for now don't worry we'll
35:45 - forget the rest of it later okay let me
35:47 - put my uh project back so you guys can
35:49 - see what i'm talking about what i'm
35:50 - talking about
35:51 - okay easy
35:53 - is equal to what
35:55 - let's just say santa monica
35:58 - good
35:59 - save it
36:00 - now to get location guys we need to go
36:03 - ahead and actually grab ah where did
36:05 - they go come on come on come on let's
36:08 - need to be able to grab this url that's
36:11 - right so i want you guys to copy this
36:13 - url i'll i'll copy this url for you as
36:15 - well so i'll copy this for you well for
36:16 - you right here
36:17 - i'll paste it in for you guys in the
36:19 - zoom chats
36:20 - and who can tell me now what kind of a
36:22 - function do we use to call this api
36:26 - who can tell me what the do we use
36:28 - you guys should know this
36:30 - yes who said that emrick amrit good job
36:33 - it is a fetch function good job so it's
36:36 - going to create a fetch function
36:39 - yo
36:41 - i'm gonna say americ
36:43 - nice so i'm gonna say i'm gonna use a
36:45 - fetch function because the fast function
36:46 - will actually call out to the api we'll
36:48 - call to this it's an external kind of
36:50 - server right we need to call that
36:51 - service almost like you're calling the
36:52 - phone right you're like hey give me the
36:54 - data
36:55 - so i'm gonna say fetch here
36:58 - i'll put in this url
37:00 - boom of course that places right but if
37:03 - you guys can see that we need to
37:04 - actually put in the you know this is the
37:06 - location right here so what i like what
37:08 - i'm going to do is i'm going to do
37:10 - something called string littles which
37:11 - will allow me to put in the variable
37:13 - location there right so we'll do this
37:16 - back tick
37:18 - back tick so watch this really quickly
37:19 - okay back to back tip and then i will
37:21 - say dollar sign brackets
37:24 - now this will allow me to use this
37:25 - location
37:28 - inside here
37:30 - that's it good job alem yes so i'm gonna
37:33 - say here location
37:36 - good and of course it ends with json
37:40 - dot json
37:41 - nice
37:42 - of course that that json exactly don't
37:45 - want
37:46 - and then
37:48 - well i guess let's see what we what we
37:50 - will get of course because i know i know
37:52 - it'll fail i'll tell you that up front i
37:54 - know this will fail this will not work
37:55 - because we don't have an access token
37:56 - but let's see this what will happen okay
37:58 - so to use a fetch function
38:00 - we are calling out this api
38:02 - then you have to say that then so it's
38:05 - like it's like the dot and it's like
38:07 - your catch-alls your catch function so
38:08 - once you
38:09 - have gone the actual you know um
38:12 - application right or
38:14 - called the api
38:16 - how do we go ahead and now and how do we
38:18 - get it so i'm gonna say response
38:21 - i'm gonna return response
38:23 - dot json
38:25 - this will return the data i get from
38:28 - this api right here
38:30 - okay and then finally i would say dot
38:33 - then
38:35 - that then and i say here and said that
38:38 - case i say that then
38:39 - data that's right
38:41 - data
38:44 - great okay let's see console.log data
38:48 - let's see we get that's all always like
38:50 - to do data
38:53 - now here's my question
38:54 - do you guys think this will run at this
38:56 - point
38:58 - do you guys think it will run
39:01 - you tell me
39:02 - why not
39:04 - why why do you think it won't run
39:06 - why
39:08 - that well yes that one but it won't even
39:10 - run at all because we're not even
39:12 - calling this function guys we need to
39:14 - call this function so let's do that
39:16 - right to call this function you guys
39:18 - might know
39:20 - we need to use a
39:22 - use effector
39:24 - i call the use effect
39:25 - use effect
39:27 - boom done
39:28 - okay so let's use use effect
39:31 - great
39:33 - okay and use the fact what's gonna
39:34 - happen is use the fact it's gonna run we
39:37 - can basically run anything you want
39:39 - inside here
39:41 - right at the beginning of the
39:42 - application it's like almost like when
39:44 - you load the application for the first
39:45 - time right but in order to make that
39:47 - happen i have to say comma
39:49 - bracket
39:51 - okay
39:52 - and then inside here
39:53 - i can what is why is there no you who
39:56 - uses a function confirmed that is
39:58 - neither a right function that makes no
39:59 - sense
40:01 - so inside the use effect then
40:04 - then we have let's see then we call that
40:07 - get
40:07 - coordinates and then we call like this
40:12 - boom
40:13 - i'm really curious why it's given us
40:15 - this error i've never had this one
40:16 - before
40:17 - like it's called in a
40:18 - function conformity there's neither a
40:20 - foundation component nor a custom
40:22 - reactive function that makes no sense i
40:24 - think maybe it's because it doesn't see
40:26 - that it's a class like a yeah see
40:28 - because yeah it's because of
40:31 - that's okay so
40:32 - guys technically you don't need to have
40:34 - this you know capitalized this is a
40:36 - function component yes right but you
40:38 - know
40:39 - due to like
40:41 - i want to say you know um
40:44 - having patterns right sometimes what
40:46 - happens is that
40:47 - vs code wants to do in certain ways so
40:49 - for example when you create classes or
40:50 - function components you actually start
40:52 - out with a capital case camel case so
40:54 - that's what's giving me this error right
40:56 - it still works you can see it does not
40:58 - break anything but it's just a good
41:00 - convention so i'm gonna change this to
41:02 - capital c confirm
41:04 - same thing goes with this one right you
41:06 - have to change it both ways guys because
41:07 - this exports the function
41:09 - and then as you guys know
41:12 - this creates the function
41:13 - boom see
41:15 - got it capisce
41:16 - it's like a piece or no
41:18 - capisce good i'm happy capicius okay
41:21 - so let's go and see i get the
41:23 - coordinates okay
41:24 - response inspect element let's see if
41:27 - this will even run
41:29 - console
41:30 - give me a bunch of ears probably i know
41:32 - it they've responded with a status of
41:34 - nothing says not authorized no token
41:37 - beautiful you see that's exactly what we
41:39 - want capito that's right
41:42 - right exactly we want guys
41:44 - so good
41:46 - so
41:46 - now we want to do is want to add the
41:48 - access token portion to this one to add
41:51 - the access token let me go on back to
41:52 - here what we're going to do is we need
41:54 - to add it is a query parameter so
41:56 - usually create parameters look like this
41:57 - it's kind of like it's kind of like i'm
41:59 - going to give an example it's like
42:02 - access token
42:04 - i just go token you know and then you
42:06 - actually give it the value that you want
42:07 - right
42:09 - in this case what i'm going to do is i'm
42:10 - going to do a little bit differently and
42:11 - i'll use a really cool tool that i call
42:13 - url search params so i'm gonna say plus
42:16 - here so just be really quick for here
42:17 - what i'm what i'm doing here right here
42:20 - okay so i'm gonna say here plus
42:22 - okay i'll hit enter so it's the next
42:25 - line because i like to keep it clean and
42:26 - i will say new url search params why
42:30 - because it will allow me to format my
42:32 - create parameters very nicely
42:34 - that's the biggest reason why okay i
42:36 - open up the parenthesis boom
42:38 - brackets boom
42:40 - it's going to do access token
42:43 - access underscore token
42:46 - is e and then colon remember it's an
42:48 - object
42:49 - right and where's the access token well
42:51 - you know
42:53 - sorry
42:54 - you guys know i'm struggling it's okay
42:57 - you got this
42:59 - all right beautiful let's go back to our
43:01 - confirm page based on our access token
43:04 - and again i got you guys you should have
43:06 - got access token from the yesterday for
43:07 - the last time if you don't just go to
43:08 - mapbox.com register get access token you
43:11 - should be fine it's completely free
43:12 - don't worry about it it's all good all
43:15 - right
43:15 - so here's our access token
43:17 - and let's see now we have so i'm gonna
43:19 - save this now and now should i give us
43:21 - the data guys
43:23 - inspect element on this one
43:26 - console
43:28 - okay let me fresh one more time let me
43:29 - first one more time let's see let's see
43:31 - hopefully it works hopefully it works
43:32 - this time
43:34 - still not authorized really
43:37 - let's see access token knox is still
43:39 - going to authorize why is that
43:41 - let me see here plus real search params
43:45 - access token
43:48 - do i not do a range
43:51 - lost oh i know why hold on i know why
43:54 - don't worry i got you i got you i got
43:55 - you i got you i got you i got you it's
43:57 - because whenever you start access
43:59 - whenever you start right remember i even
44:01 - did it right here we start out with a
44:03 - question mark that's one that's when
44:05 - um the browser knows that it's a create
44:07 - parameter right here
44:09 - inside here we don't have a question
44:10 - mark so we need to say
44:11 - question mark
44:13 - and then we do the access token okay i
44:16 - know simple stuff but you know it is
44:18 - what it is gonna happen that way hey
44:20 - guys we got ourselves the data
44:23 - data guys check this out we got the data
44:26 - okay that's right
44:28 - so here's how data looks like this data
44:30 - is coming from where who can tell me
44:32 - where is the data coming from
44:34 - where's it coming from you tell me where
44:36 - is it coming from
44:37 - yes it's coming from mapbox
44:40 - that's right it's coming from mapbox
44:41 - right here good job devlin yes and
44:44 - benjamin good from lm yes so here this
44:47 - is our data
44:49 - you can see it has features
44:51 - and it has certain places
44:53 - right here
44:54 - we have an array we have the first index
44:56 - right here and here's the center right
44:57 - these are like the coordinates of santa
44:59 - monica
45:00 - boom see to the corners of the monika
45:02 - now because it gives us a lot a lot of
45:04 - different features which you don't
45:05 - really need it could scale that's like
45:06 - neighborhood all this whole bunch of
45:09 - crap we don't
45:10 - no that's not necessary
45:13 - so instead
45:14 - what i'm going to do
45:15 - is i'm going to go ahead and i'm going
45:18 - to say limit of one so i'm gonna add a
45:20 - limit to this one
45:21 - comma make sure add the comma
45:24 - limit
45:25 - colon one save it
45:27 - done so okay let's go back to see what
45:29 - we got
45:31 - okay let's see let's see let's see
45:33 - features beautiful we got only one thing
45:35 - that's all we need and then we've got
45:37 - the center that's exactly what we need
45:39 - guys okay exactly what we need
45:42 - so okay
45:46 - okay so we got this portion we got the
45:48 - center looking pretty good i'm lucky
45:50 - where this is going okay okay okay
45:52 - all right and now however we need to
45:54 - save this data somehow right we've got
45:56 - these coordinates these are gonna be the
45:58 - coordinates for the pickup coordinate
45:59 - and the drop of coordinates that we're
46:00 - gonna use right here right here exactly
46:03 - pick up and drop of coordinates right
46:06 - so at this point let me go and
46:07 - console.log to get our data
46:11 - in terms of
46:12 - pickup coordinates
46:14 - we need to enter the features we do the
46:16 - data.features then within that get the
46:18 - first index of zero
46:20 - then get the center so let's see it
46:22 - so we say consider log
46:24 - okay
46:25 - dot features
46:27 - and then within that what do we do guys
46:28 - who can tell me what do we do here i'll
46:30 - give you guys some pointers who can tell
46:31 - me how do i finish this so you get the
46:33 - actual center
46:35 - okay give me the full string guys full
46:37 - string i'll put your name on there full
46:39 - string
46:40 - that features then what full strength
46:42 - really quickly guys five seconds five
46:44 - four yes a lot nice job
46:48 - good job i'm gonna give you some fire
46:49 - right here i'll give you a rocket emoji
46:50 - this time
46:51 - beautiful
46:52 - i'm not sure what your name is but it
46:53 - says alarm on your thing so beautiful
46:56 - number zero zero
46:59 - dot
47:00 - uh
47:01 - center
47:02 - okay let's see if this works
47:05 - let's see
47:07 - hey we got the coordinates that's
47:09 - exactly what we need beautiful
47:11 - so okay we're in the confirm page i like
47:13 - where this is going now this point right
47:16 - we've got the coordinates and it's just
47:17 - really pretty good
47:19 - but now we need to go ahead and save the
47:21 - pickup coordinates and the drop of
47:23 - coordinates right there there's two
47:24 - there's two things there's the pickup
47:25 - and there's a drop off so
47:28 - so how do we go ahead and get
47:32 - both right well let's go ahead and
47:34 - create two functions one to get the
47:35 - pickup coordinates and one to get the
47:36 - drop of coordinates so let's do that
47:37 - right now so i'm going to call i'm going
47:39 - to rename this function right here i can
47:40 - do command d to rename it all the same
47:43 - time so i'll say get
47:45 - pickup
47:47 - coordinates
47:49 - coordinates
47:51 - okay pick up coordinates you guys can
47:53 - see that it did it in two places in here
47:55 - and in here so just pay attention to
47:57 - this one
47:59 - and then i say const
48:01 - get drop off
48:08 - is equal to what
48:19 - that's good that's good stuff
48:21 - that's right cuppy pasta that's right so
48:24 - so now get drop-off coordinates you know
48:26 - the rule guys copy pasta the best thing
48:28 - in the world i'm gonna copy this one
48:30 - pasta this one
48:32 - and then i'm going to enjoy the pasta
48:34 - okay
48:35 - okay everything should be the same
48:37 - except what guys
48:39 - because this technically should be the
48:40 - drop off okay the drop of coordinates
48:42 - okay technically and
48:45 - and honestly that's pretty much it
48:46 - they've got the drop of coordinates and
48:48 - let's see it see it see
48:49 - so now i'm gonna i'm gonna change this
48:51 - one to be pickup
48:52 - pick i'm gonna call this pickup now
48:54 - right because we have two things pick up
48:56 - and drop off pick up
48:57 - so i'm gonna go up to the pickup
48:59 - coordinates right here
49:00 - and i'll change what instead of doing
49:02 - location i say pick up right here
49:05 - okay and our drop off is going to be
49:08 - what guys
49:09 - our drop off is going to be what
49:14 - a drop is going to be what that's right
49:16 - our drop-off is going to be right here
49:19 - drop off
49:21 - good and this i'm going to call this los
49:23 - angeles
49:26 - nice
49:28 - okay okay
49:31 - los angeles
49:32 - and i want to change this one to be los
49:35 - angeles right here uh called drop off
49:38 - beautiful
49:40 - nice okay so we got two coordinates
49:43 - probably at this point so let's see if i
49:45 - want to get the location of the
49:48 - the drop off i'm gonna say drop off
49:52 - save it let's see what we've got
49:54 - ourselves in oops
49:56 - hope that's not what i want i want this
49:58 - one a we got right here two locations
50:00 - right right we got actually no we don't
50:03 - have two locations because we haven't
50:04 - called the drop of coordinates we do so
50:06 - we need to do a git
50:08 - drop of coordinates as well
50:10 - beans
50:13 - beautiful exactly see that's exactly
50:15 - what we want beautiful so let's go ahead
50:17 - and see so i saved this
50:19 - okay let's see what we get in the actual
50:22 - here a we've got the pickup coordinates
50:23 - and then we get the dropper coordinates
50:25 - they're not too far away from each other
50:26 - you know because they're not too far
50:27 - away from each other just just normally
50:29 - so go so now we get these coordinates
50:32 - now here's my question okay my goal now
50:35 - at this point let's go ahead and go to
50:36 - our plan
50:37 - we got a coordinates good job follow me
50:39 - on this one right so we got our
50:40 - coordinates what's the next thing guys
50:42 - who can tell me
50:45 - who could tell me what's the next one
50:48 - or next to do
50:49 - six is gonna be what what's it has to do
50:51 - guys
50:52 - it's going to be not the car list no
50:55 - the markers yes bob good job bob i'll
50:58 - give you some pointers here so
51:00 - add the
51:01 - pickup
51:03 - and
51:04 - drop off
51:08 - markers
51:10 - on the map
51:12 - right
51:12 - and this was bob so good job bob i'm
51:14 - saying i'll give you a rocket right here
51:16 - wow good job
51:18 - all right so got those two things
51:20 - capisce
51:22 - all right let's go to our confirmed gs
51:25 - all right i like where this is going go
51:27 - from the gs catch up with coordinates
51:29 - get pick up coordinates i liken this
51:32 - now at this point right we need to be
51:36 - able to save our coordinates somewhere
51:39 - right we get all these coordinates for
51:41 - the pickup for the drop-off but where do
51:42 - we save them well with just one thing
51:44 - you need to know guys that inside our
51:46 - applications right here
51:48 - right it has data
51:51 - okay
51:52 - it has data so in order to save that
51:54 - data we use something called use state
51:57 - so pay attention here it's called i'm
51:58 - going to just write this out for you
51:59 - it's called
52:00 - use
52:02 - stay who can tell what your state is if
52:03 - you guys can just let me know down in
52:05 - the comments below i'm really curious to
52:07 - see which what you know right you state
52:10 - that's right yes it's a hook that's
52:11 - right that's right lm it's a state
52:14 - management tool right
52:16 - so let's go to import you state inside
52:18 - here
52:19 - right here guys
52:22 - so i'm gonna say comma
52:25 - use state
52:27 - save it
52:28 - all right beautiful so our use date is
52:30 - there i'm lucky where that's going
52:33 - all right
52:35 - let's see and to use our use state we're
52:37 - going to create two things
52:39 - one is going to be the pickup
52:40 - coordinates right because you want to be
52:42 - able to save these pick up corners we
52:43 - get inside here into the
52:46 - big you know into the data the database
52:48 - of the whole application
52:50 - so i'm gonna do that right now with you
52:52 - to do it here's kind of how it works and
52:54 - just watch it and i'll explain to you in
52:56 - a second here so i will say const
52:59 - brackets and i will say
53:01 - pickup coordinates
53:04 - pick up coordinates
53:08 - and set pickup coordinates
53:13 - good and i will say equal to use state
53:17 - there we go you stay
53:20 - and so far just nothing right and then
53:22 - i'm going to create the same thing copy
53:23 - pasta this one commands v this one and i
53:26 - say drop off coordinates right here
53:28 - drop
53:29 - off
53:31 - off
53:32 - coordinates
53:33 - that's right and i'm gonna say it's also
53:35 - setup of coordinates set
53:38 - drop off
53:41 - set drop
53:43 - off coordinates
53:45 - so maybe you could can tell me how this
53:47 - works but
53:50 - if you know put down the chat but
53:52 - what happens here is you say it's like
53:54 - it tells okay so usted says hey you know
53:56 - what we're about to go ahead and create
53:58 - our application we're about to say store
54:00 - some data that's like initialize the
54:02 - data storage right it's like it's like
54:04 - you literally just bought a box to store
54:05 - some presents in there okay imagine
54:07 - you're you're going to christmas you're
54:08 - like you know what i need to buy a box
54:10 - to be able to ship it somewhere actually
54:12 - there you go it's you bought a box for
54:14 - shipping that's a really good
54:15 - terminology right it's like hey you know
54:16 - what let's prepare that box
54:18 - pick up coordinates is what is whatever
54:20 - inside that box that's the presence
54:22 - maybe inside the box so that's the
54:24 - that's this right here
54:25 - the set pickup coordinates is whatever
54:27 - you want to put in the box so this we're
54:29 - going to use to put in the box
54:32 - this is going to use to get whatever
54:34 - inside of the box
54:36 - just to give you some perspective here
54:37 - this right here is the get function
54:39 - almost like this it's like the get
54:41 - function almost well this is the
54:43 - set
54:44 - function right
54:46 - and that's what you say allows us to do
54:48 - so let's just that's just kind of how it
54:49 - all works
54:50 - let's now check this out if i go ahead
54:53 - if i go ahead and i say here set
54:56 - say what pick up coordinates
54:58 - and i say here what d that feature
55:00 - center that's exactly what we need boom
55:02 - boom boom put it inside here
55:05 - remove it
55:07 - okay let's go ahead and remove this
55:08 - portion
55:09 - save it
55:11 - okay don't worry it's nothing there
55:14 - okay nothing's there okay we do the same
55:17 - thing to our get drop of coordinates
55:19 - we'll get down like guys drop in the
55:20 - comments we need to need to what do we
55:21 - put in there set what
55:23 - five four
55:25 - three
55:26 - two
55:27 - [Music]
55:28 - come on come on come on come on you guys
55:30 - got this come on yes i'm rick that's
55:32 - right we need to say set drop of
55:34 - coordinates now
55:35 - so here i say set
55:36 - drop of coordinates
55:39 - good good good good good good good good
55:41 - good and now at this point i say what
55:46 - sorry i say
55:48 - data features at center
55:50 - beautiful
55:51 - beautiful right here i can remove this
55:53 - console.log
55:54 - i don't need any of this stuff
55:56 - good so how do we test it actually works
55:58 - well we can simply console log both of
56:00 - these
56:01 - so i say console.log
56:04 - that lock pick up coordinates
56:07 - beautiful
56:08 - and then actually here here's here's my
56:09 - suggestion i won't even console login
56:11 - for you i'll just put it directly inside
56:12 - here
56:13 - so here
56:15 - pick up coordinates
56:17 - and then drop of coordinates again this
56:19 - is not for application but it's just for
56:20 - you to see it
56:22 - let's see boom right here guys right
56:24 - there you guys can just see right there
56:26 - oops
56:28 - boom see boom boom boom these are the
56:29 - pickup and the drop of coordinates so
56:31 - showcase to you right that this guy's
56:33 - works this works okay
56:36 - so got these two things beautiful i'm
56:38 - lucky this is going guys you guys still
56:40 - with me everybody's still with me guys
56:42 - give me some fire give me some energy i
56:44 - know we're trying our best adeline is
56:46 - out here if you guys are on youtube give
56:48 - it a thumbs up thumbs up i don't know
56:50 - how my somehow my thought is surviving
56:52 - i'm not gonna lie guys i probably i
56:55 - probably went to the store and i bought
56:56 - like three products to try i did like
56:58 - three things to try and relieve this you
57:00 - know i did like gargling everything it
57:02 - was crazy
57:05 - we're trying
57:06 - our best here all right it's okay
57:10 - and then today we're just having fun um
57:12 - we're here just to learn and that's it
57:14 - okay so if you guys on youtube drop some
57:16 - fire of course drop some thumbs up
57:18 - because we're doing some good stuff i'm
57:19 - lucky where this is going yes thank you
57:21 - guys crystal julian you guys are amazing
57:24 - thank you so much everybody emrick oh my
57:26 - god you guys are crazy so okay let's
57:29 - continue guys you guys ready to continue
57:30 - on
57:31 - yes yeah yeah yeah
57:34 - okay beautiful it was like yeah let's go
57:38 - okay so we got these coordinates okay
57:40 - cool
57:41 - we we we're showing them it's there okay
57:44 - no no problem whatsoever but the thing
57:46 - is you guys need to understand is
57:49 - is now going to do is how do we now show
57:51 - them in the map right here's our map
57:53 - right here right it's inside the map.gs
57:56 - it's our map and we have a random point
57:58 - that you as you can see here we have
58:00 - this random point it's like somewhere
58:02 - all the way here right that's not very
58:03 - useful though we need to actually add
58:05 - the pickup and the drop of coordinates
58:08 - so i want to introduce to you something
58:09 - called props okay if i want to be able
58:12 - to pass in data from this i want to be
58:14 - able to pass in this
58:16 - pickup coordinates all this stuff right
58:17 - here about to pass in this right so it's
58:20 - kind of like this i'm able to pass in
58:21 - this pick up coordinates and triple
58:23 - coordinates
58:24 - into the map.js
58:27 - component i'm going to we're going to
58:30 - use something called props okay
58:32 - so let's let's
58:33 - just just hold on with me for a second
58:35 - here so here's what i'll do i'll do i'll
58:37 - say here this
58:38 - pickup coordinates is equal to
58:42 - pickup coordinates it's like basically
58:45 - you are you know throwing something into
58:48 - the house almost like imagine that right
58:50 - it's like you're throwing something into
58:51 - the house you're passing something to
58:53 - the house you're giving like a pre
58:54 - you're giving something to your friend
58:56 - right you're passing something along so
58:58 - we're doing is we're passing on this
58:59 - data into the map component right that's
59:02 - right
59:03 - okay same thing doesn't go to the
59:05 - drop-off coordinates
59:07 - equals to this
59:08 - drop of coordinates
59:10 - okay save it
59:11 - going to be passed along into the map
59:13 - data capisce got it let's go and save
59:16 - that
59:17 - at this point inside map.js guys inside
59:20 - map.js i will go ahead and go to here
59:23 - and okay it's all great we pass it in
59:26 - but how do we actually now use it right
59:28 - we pass it into here
59:30 - now we need to somehow get it in map.js
59:32 - what that's what i remember has
59:33 - something called props let's do this
59:36 - props
59:38 - save it yes that's right anthony you
59:39 - pass the props and i want to show you
59:41 - exactly what props looks like i want to
59:42 - console.log
59:46 - props
59:48 - let's see it let's see it
59:50 - okay hey right here this is our props
59:52 - guys look at this it has exactly two
59:54 - things what do we pass and remember we
59:55 - passed in the drop of coordinates and
59:57 - the pickup coordinates and they pass it
59:59 - into the map component it's like
60:02 - right into the map component just went
60:03 - inside of there right so there you go
60:05 - you put it directly into here guys
60:10 - all right cool so can moving forward
60:13 - when i need to use this somehow and
60:16 - actually add it to the map and this is
60:18 - why we created this function called add
60:19 - to map
60:20 - okay because now we can add random
60:22 - certain points
60:24 - what can tell me now
60:26 - how do i add
60:27 - i want to be able to
60:28 - add a coordinate to the map at the
60:31 - beginning of when the map loads what do
60:33 - i do
60:34 - what do i do
60:35 - you tell me
60:37 - what i do
60:40 - i will go ahead and put your name on
60:41 - there i will do everything what did i do
60:43 - guys
60:44 - yo who said that militia malaysia nice
60:46 - job use the fact that's right malicious
60:48 - good job so i'm gonna say give you some
60:49 - rocket right here
60:51 - good job alicia
60:54 - let me give you a rocket right here was
60:55 - my rocket rocket okay
60:58 - my least shot uh hopefully i spelled it
61:00 - right if i didn't i'm sorry you know
61:01 - i'll try my best it's okay so use effect
61:05 - beautiful yes
61:07 - create the function right so
61:09 - do we have and we have import use effect
61:11 - right here which is beautiful as well
61:13 - and of course we need to do comma
61:15 - this tells it to load us exactly the
61:17 - beginning and so now inside the props
61:20 - let's see
61:22 - at this point we need to be able to add
61:24 - to map right for both of these things
61:26 - the pickup coordinates and then for
61:28 - the the drop of coordinates correct
61:31 - exactly
61:33 - so let's do this so if i have here let's
61:36 - see
61:36 - console.log let's see
61:38 - console.log
61:42 - come on
61:43 - console.log and i say
61:46 - props dot
61:48 - pickup coordinates what actually
61:50 - showcase to me what i need
61:52 - i'm going to make sure i want to copy
61:53 - this properly i will go to confirm.js
61:55 - and i'll just copy this properly because
61:56 - and i want to you know
61:58 - i'm not copy this correctly
62:00 - you're from ngs
62:01 - i'll go back to the map
62:03 - i'll paste it right here boom pick up
62:06 - coordinates and let's see now if we get
62:08 - it let's see if we get it now
62:10 - hey we got it right here right so we get
62:12 - two things that's our pickup coordinates
62:14 - and of course
62:15 - about what about drop of coordinates
62:17 - let's do the same thing with that one
62:18 - let's do console.log
62:21 - the log
62:23 - props the drop of coordinates
62:26 - same thing i want to copy it directly
62:28 - from here because i want to i don't want
62:29 - to spell it guys sorry
62:31 - i'll now go back to my
62:32 - gs okay save it okay beautiful
62:37 - let's see now a right here see so we got
62:39 - it right here so we get the pickup and
62:41 - the drop-off and it's working but here's
62:42 - one should pay attention here if i
62:44 - refresh this
62:46 - okay look at watch watch this look at
62:48 - first they're undefined that's an issue
62:50 - that's a very big issue initially these
62:53 - are undefined until very much later on
62:55 - so when we first load the application
62:57 - right yes it runs the whole thing
62:58 - correctly but why do you think it's
63:00 - undefined who can tell me
63:02 - why do you think it's undefined
63:04 - i'll give you guys some point for this
63:05 - one why do you think it's undefined
63:08 - alem says
63:10 - no not necessarily not not that benjamin
63:13 - no no it's not not about you state
63:17 - no no no
63:22 - no that's right there is no coordinates
63:24 - initially right so initially there is no
63:26 - coin is moving when we first load
63:29 - it does not pass in because inside the
63:31 - confirm.js
63:32 - if you think about it this right here
63:34 - api
63:36 - right this is an api fetch call it takes
63:38 - time like it literally takes maybe a
63:40 - second to two seconds to load so while
63:42 - all this is going on right i know
63:45 - oh sorry hold on oops what i just do
63:48 - right so while all this is going on guys
63:51 - it's just loading load and loading and
63:53 - so initially the pickup coordinates is
63:55 - absolutely nothing and so when it goes
63:57 - to here and it passes all this data
64:00 - okay it presents all this data it's
64:02 - nothing
64:04 - that's the issue here that's the issue
64:06 - so what we need to do is we need to go
64:08 - back to mata yes i mean to say hey you
64:09 - know what whenever you see that these
64:12 - coordinates change like the actual value
64:14 - of them changes
64:15 - run it again check this out
64:18 - oops
64:19 - run it again like so
64:22 - okay
64:23 - okay let's see who cause the fact he has
64:25 - a missed dependency props the drop of
64:26 - coordinates oh good don't worry
64:29 - so at this point we've got that we've
64:31 - got that we've got that and now we can
64:33 - do two things we can say here inside the
64:35 - use effect we say
64:36 - if the pickup coordinates
64:38 - exist right
64:41 - oh actually hold on there's two but wait
64:42 - there's too many use effects i just
64:43 - realized this there's too many use
64:44 - effects i don't want this one
64:46 - [Music]
64:47 - i don't need to let me use effect i can
64:49 - just put it all well actually not
64:50 - necessarily not true
64:54 - let me see let me see oh there we go
64:56 - there we go nevermind it's all good i
64:58 - can actually have multiple user fights
64:59 - guys it is completely okay i know i'm
65:01 - not using a sync away bob not just yet
65:04 - okay so we got this user effect that's
65:06 - going to initialize our map okay and
65:09 - this user file is going to wait for the
65:10 - pickup coordinates and the drop-off
65:11 - coordinates so let's go ahead and do
65:13 - pickup coordinates and then next is
65:15 - going to be the drop-off
65:18 - props that drop of coordinates let me
65:20 - see here
65:22 - props
65:31 - drop of coordinates right here so props
65:34 - dot drop of coordinates but beautiful
65:36 - okay so we got those two things okay so
65:38 - then we'll say here's the following i'm
65:39 - gonna say that if the pickup coordinates
65:41 - are there and the trouble corners are
65:43 - there then i will go ahead and add it to
65:44 - the map okay so i'm gonna say here
65:47 - if
65:49 - pick up coordinates
65:52 - pick up coordinates right are actually
65:54 - available
65:55 - then i say add to map
65:59 - add to map and so forth but here's my
66:01 - question what do i piss into this map
66:03 - right i call this function right the
66:05 - function is this one right here
66:06 - this is the function
66:08 - we need to pass them well guys
66:11 - who'd you pass in wall who could tell me
66:12 - what do you pass in
66:15 - that's right the map good job emeric yes
66:17 - yes yes good job right the map this is
66:20 - where it gets a little bit trickier
66:21 - because our map is only available here
66:23 - that's the tricky part right so our map
66:25 - is only available here so even then now
66:29 - this tells us i want to show you guys
66:30 - this that we do have to add things
66:32 - wherever they are available
66:35 - inside this function do we have a map
66:36 - yes or no
66:38 - yes or no
66:40 - no we don't anthony that's right so we
66:42 - can't really do this at app inside this
66:44 - user fact we have to do it in which is
66:46 - effect in
66:48 - this one
66:49 - that's right got it
66:52 - so it's okay not a big deal we can just
66:53 - simply just go ahead and change it up so
66:55 - i will go ahead and copy this command c
66:57 - this one
66:58 - command v on this one
67:00 - okay i could remove this whole thing not
67:03 - the most important thing
67:05 - malicious still good job don't worry
67:08 - then inside here i'm gonna go ahead and
67:11 - do
67:12 - if if
67:14 - props dot
67:16 - pick up coordinates
67:18 - i will do add to map
67:21 - and i will pass in the map that we have
67:23 - but i will also pass in the chord
67:25 - because right now this corner is static
67:26 - right you guys can see it's static it's
67:28 - nothing does not mean anything
67:31 - so what do you do what what do we say
67:33 - guys what do we pass in here we do pass
67:35 - in a certain parameter instead of this
67:36 - one
67:37 - to replace this element
67:40 - what do we pass in that's right that
67:43 - that's right exactly exactly good job it
67:46 - was i want to say devlin good job i'm
67:48 - gonna say sam this time because wait no
67:49 - sam was like no no that's right sam good
67:51 - job sam
67:54 - so i'm gonna say
68:00 - boom yes so you say add to map you say
68:04 - props dot pickup coordinates
68:07 - okay
68:08 - okay and that means we have to add the
68:10 - actual um
68:12 - parameter i call inside the atom app so
68:14 - we'll say here uh coordinate
68:17 - coordinates and i can replace this
68:20 - static coordinate because the dynamic is
68:22 - changing coordinate static is like
68:24 - basically something you just put in just
68:25 - for static values
68:27 - and then we have coordinates side here
68:29 - so save it and let's see this actually
68:31 - works guys
68:32 - oh
68:33 - look at that our first one works to pick
68:35 - up one santa monica is
68:38 - working no problem whatsoever
68:41 - yeah guys guys give me some fire in the
68:43 - in the chat uh in the in the youtube
68:46 - chats in the zoom chats guys they'll be
68:47 - amazing
68:50 - i wanna see more i wanna see more i want
68:51 - to see more more more more more more
68:53 - more more more more beautiful beautiful
68:56 - beautiful yes that's right sam does moon
68:58 - matthew fabio beautiful i'm loving this
69:01 - guys i'm loving this
69:05 - you guys are crazy
69:06 - okay so we've got the we got this one
69:08 - guys what should we do next one do we
69:10 - got the pickup coordinates should we do
69:12 - the same thing with the drop of
69:13 - coordinates yes or no who can tell me
69:16 - yes or no
69:17 - yes or no yes okay good so let's do this
69:20 - i'm saying if
69:22 - props
69:23 - dot drop of coordinates
69:26 - okay boom i will say add to map
69:30 - i will say add to map
69:33 - i will say map and this time i will say
69:35 - props not pick up coordinates but above
69:36 - props
69:37 - dot
69:39 - drop off coordinates
69:41 - okay now we should have two buttons oh
69:45 - god it's so good i'm so good i don't
69:47 - know what to do with this you know just
69:48 - too good that's right
69:50 - you know that's right so we got two
69:52 - points now
69:53 - now
69:55 - always handy dandy okay
69:57 - but
69:58 - okay let me go back let me go let me let
70:00 - me let me go ahead and i'll go to our
70:01 - plan right at the pick-up drop of
70:03 - markets to the map okay that's got it
70:05 - okay
70:06 - now there's one thing i don't like about
70:08 - how this works okay i just i just hate
70:09 - it i'm like yeah this is just nasty okay
70:12 - it's nasty and what is it about this
70:14 - that you that you hate
70:15 - okay
70:16 - let me ask you this do you guys see the
70:18 - actual the actual
70:20 - um what's it called
70:22 - that's right benjamin the zoom
70:24 - that's right so ben i'm gonna add this
70:26 - to you for this one go ahead add a auto
70:30 - zoom
70:31 - to be able to
70:33 - zoom into the markers
70:36 - yes good job guys i'm gonna give it to
70:38 - ben this time
70:40 - fire
70:42 - you guys liking me putting your names on
70:43 - there you guys like should i stop doing
70:45 - that let me know if you get if you guys
70:46 - don't like that if you guys don't i'll
70:47 - just stop it but if you guys do i'll
70:49 - just keep putting it
70:52 - beautiful yeah just you know keep
70:55 - keep it like it make you like
70:56 - competition you know the more name the
70:58 - more names i'll put on maybe it's like a
70:59 - competition that'll be cool i think you
71:01 - know
71:01 - so ben awesome job
71:04 - okay at this point let's go back to our
71:06 - confirm how do we auto zoom this stuff
71:08 - well to autozoom here's something really
71:10 - cool there's something called fit to
71:12 - bounce i'm going to show this to you
71:13 - here
71:15 - so map box
71:17 - fit bounce
71:19 - not not get bounce but fit bounce
71:22 - that's right so it kind of works like
71:24 - this
71:25 - so here i can there's a function right
71:28 - here
71:29 - that's called fit bounce i will use a
71:30 - map to fit back and i will pass it what
71:32 - do you think these are guys
71:33 - what do you think these are these are
71:35 - exactly what
71:37 - these are
71:38 - yeah these are coordinates right and we
71:40 - have coordinates that's great we have
71:42 - coordinates so let's go back to here
71:44 - fit bounce
71:46 - all right let's see what else we got
71:47 - here
71:48 - google is your best friend always and
71:50 - look we can even do like a padding we
71:51 - can even do it like a padding when we
71:53 - zoom into stuff that's so cool
71:55 - so let's go and do that functionality
71:58 - to do it all we have to do is is
72:00 - inside here inside our map.js
72:04 - okay where we get the
72:06 - pickup coordinates in the drop of
72:07 - coordinates
72:08 - all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna say here
72:10 - if
72:12 - props dot
72:15 - pick up coordinates
72:17 - and
72:19 - props dot what
72:22 - drop of course if both of them exist at
72:24 - the same time i want to add them at the
72:26 - same time to the thing right so let's do
72:27 - that i'm going to do this i'm going to
72:29 - say map
72:31 - map
72:34 - that fit bounce
72:37 - fit bounds just how we have that in the
72:39 - function
72:40 - parenthesis
72:42 - right there now actually no it's uh it's
72:44 - another object it's an array
72:47 - beautiful and inside that we should be
72:49 - at what do we add guys who can tell me
72:51 - what corners do we add i'll give you
72:52 - some price of this one too what corners
72:54 - do we add come on come on come on five
72:56 - four three two
72:59 - you guys are so quick you guys can't
73:00 - even write the whole thing
73:04 - all right i'll give it to your lamb okay
73:06 - allah was trying to actually actually no
73:08 - fabi got it first sorry fabi got the got
73:11 - it first
73:13 - all right i'll give it to fabio here
73:16 - all right fabio so fit bounds i'm gonna
73:19 - do the props
73:21 - here
73:22 - dot drop of coordinates comma
73:26 - props dot pickup coordinates
73:29 - okay
73:30 - let's see if this actually works okay
73:32 - let me see if this actually works and
73:35 - save it
73:37 - okay
73:39 - oh
73:42 - look at how beautiful this is guys whoa
73:46 - okay it's still not the best don't worry
73:48 - so remember how we said we can use a
73:49 - padding guys right
73:51 - here so we can do padding so then after
73:53 - this one i can do comma and there's
73:55 - options you can add into the into this
73:56 - one here so for example i can add a
73:58 - padding i'll just say let's just say
73:59 - it's padding off let's just say 60.
74:04 - okay and so padding creates space on the
74:06 - inside right and it will try to fit
74:08 - those bounds
74:09 - guys give me some fire for this one give
74:10 - me no don't give me the rocket i want to
74:12 - i want them rockets guys no no more fire
74:14 - i want them rockets because that was too
74:15 - good okay
74:17 - this this thing just flew to the moon i
74:19 - just flew all the way to the moon and
74:20 - beyond the moon and all it to mars you
74:22 - know like ilan moss did okay so we're
74:24 - being like elon musk right now okay
74:26 - that's who we are okay that's right i
74:28 - want to see more i want to see more i
74:29 - want to see more yeah that's right
74:31 - exactly exactly i want to keep keep
74:32 - going keep going keep going keep going
74:34 - that's exactly that's it that's it
74:38 - bobby is laughing he's like ah that's so
74:39 - cool so
74:41 - awesome we got that portion okay that's
74:44 - all good
74:44 - so in terms of the coordinates i think
74:47 - it's pretty good guys the next thing i
74:48 - want to do guys is let's go ahead and um
74:51 - well
74:52 - there's a lot of things that still
74:54 - definitely still allow me to do let's go
74:56 - back to our plan let's go mark this done
74:58 - this is like a long day potentially
75:02 - what check mark
75:03 - okay
75:05 - okay so what check mark number eight
75:07 - guys number eight you probably know at
75:09 - this point what to do you probably don't
75:11 - know what to do is when what to do
75:13 - but we've got the pickup we got the drop
75:16 - of coordinates here's my issue okay
75:18 - right now it's static so meaning if i go
75:20 - to the search oh what is this if i go to
75:22 - the search page
75:24 - i'll go to the search page
75:27 - okay whatever i put in here doesn't
75:29 - matter because if i confirm locations it
75:31 - will still just oh okay
75:33 - that doesn't even work so
75:35 - it doesn't matter even what if i if i
75:37 - did current locations because you know
75:39 - when i go to confirm you guys can see
75:41 - right here which is i'm just changing my
75:43 - link here so as i confirm
75:46 - boom technically nothing kind of happens
75:48 - it will still say santa monica you know
75:50 - and los angeles
75:52 - um now
75:54 - i'm gonna go back
75:56 - okay i'm gonna go back here i'm going to
75:58 - do now is we need to go ahead and tie
76:00 - these things in
76:01 - right tie these things in so that we can
76:04 - actually pass this data this data into
76:07 - what
76:08 - into you know the actual you know
76:10 - confirm page so let's go ahead and do
76:12 - this let's go to our plan
76:14 - and we need to go ahead let's understand
76:16 - pass in
76:18 - uh location data
76:24 - location data
76:26 - into
76:28 - confirm page all right everybody's still
76:29 - with me i think i hope so
76:31 - okay next thing so on the confirm
76:34 - actually no search page
76:36 - search page
76:37 - in the search page how do we pass in
76:39 - this data that's so interesting how do
76:41 - we pass this data
76:42 - to the next page
76:45 - you're probably wondering i mean you
76:47 - guys guess can you guys guess what what
76:49 - we can do you tell me
76:51 - not props it's a little bit different
76:53 - now because we're dealing with two
76:54 - videos we're not dealing with component
76:55 - dealing with pages now
76:57 - not fetch no
76:59 - no no
77:01 - you guys can't do it no you guess no no
77:02 - not madbox either neither one of those
77:05 - guys
77:06 - so
77:07 - we're actually going to link it
77:09 - check this out
77:11 - if i want to link this confirm locations
77:12 - button to go to the next page i'll just
77:13 - look like this i'll say link here and i
77:15 - will say link and i will say link you
77:17 - know um i'll just let's create a link
77:19 - for now i will say link here
77:23 - right
77:25 - now i will say i will close out this
77:26 - link
77:28 - boom okay great and i'll say shrap
77:31 - is equal to what guys this ref is equal
77:33 - to dash confirm right so this will take
77:35 - directly to the actual confirm page
77:38 - that's what i want so if i click on this
77:39 - one okay paste the page that's what i
77:42 - want exactly okay let's go back
77:44 - okay so that's not an issue but the one
77:47 - thing you can do is look at this
77:49 - pass
77:51 - parameters
77:53 - into
77:55 - into link
77:57 - next gs
78:00 - okay it's called right here next yes
78:03 - you're up i'm gonna show you exactly how
78:04 - this works
78:06 - let me show you this boom so there's one
78:08 - really cool thing here it's called link
78:10 - shrap path name about
78:12 - with a query huh
78:15 - that's really interesting that's right
78:17 - who said that
78:18 - kisly query parameters that's correct
78:20 - he's like query parameters for this one
78:23 - so let me try this okay i'm gonna try
78:24 - exactly how we have it right here
78:27 - i will say inside here instead of doing
78:29 - strap confirm i will say it i will open
78:30 - up brackets
78:32 - and inside here i'm gonna do two things
78:33 - one is gonna be path name
78:36 - boom
78:37 - and what is the path name confirm
78:40 - comma
78:41 - after that
78:43 - actually after that we have a query
78:45 - and that's a data we're going to pass in
78:47 - everybody so what data are we passing
78:48 - into here guys who can tell me
78:50 - what data are we passing into here
78:53 - what data what could tell me
78:55 - someone say you misspelt confirmed did i
78:58 - i did actually thank you damn you guys
78:59 - are
79:06 - good continue on all right so we need to
79:09 - pass least that's right location that's
79:11 - right so i'm gonna give it to this one
79:12 - to share good job sure yes
79:17 - [Music]
79:19 - yes good job
79:21 - right there so query to be a few things
79:24 - that's an object so i'm going to say
79:26 - pick up
79:28 - pick up location
79:30 - let's just say santa monica
79:33 - santa monica
79:37 - and then drop off
79:40 - it's gonna be which one
79:42 - drop is gonna be
79:45 - that's right los angeles
79:48 - good so look i know it feels weird don't
79:51 - worry about this all these squiggly
79:52 - lines that's just i don't know why it
79:54 - does that that's the weirdest part
79:56 - so that's right so we got two things
79:58 - we've got the pickup and then drop off
80:01 - okay now i want you to pay attention to
80:02 - this let's see okay let's see what
80:04 - happens okay
80:06 - but you attend should do this link you
80:08 - guys see this pay attention to this link
80:09 - i want you really close to pay attention
80:11 - to this this will change really cool all
80:13 - right if i click on for confirm
80:15 - locations
80:16 - watch this let me make this bigger for
80:18 - you
80:19 - boom do you guys see how the santa
80:21 - monica data and the drop-off data is all
80:25 - in the actual url
80:27 - do you guys see that yes or no
80:30 - how cool is that you guys see that yes
80:32 - that's right so that's how we're going
80:34 - to pass in the data it's going to be in
80:36 - it's called the query parameter
80:39 - into the next page that's right that's
80:41 - it i want to i want to see some give me
80:42 - some clapping guys because that's pretty
80:43 - good i will pat on my back for me okay i
80:46 - wanna i wanna see that in the in the
80:48 - emoji and everything okay in the
80:49 - comments and everything everywhere okay
80:53 - all right so let's go ahead and continue
80:54 - on
80:55 - so we got that all good but of course
80:57 - i'm not gonna pass this on the mod
80:58 - because then you're not gonna always go
81:00 - to santa monica so we need to pass in
81:01 - whatever we typed into here into this
81:03 - input okay
81:05 - and that's where you need to go smarter
81:06 - now
81:07 - before
81:08 - in order to save data when we whatever
81:10 - we input into into here into these
81:13 - inputs right
81:14 - let me go back to my search page here
81:17 - whatever you put in these inputs we have
81:18 - to save them somewhere so in order to
81:20 - save what do we do is guys we use
81:21 - something called what
81:23 - something called what use state so it's
81:26 - gonna import use state
81:29 - use state beautiful save it
81:32 - i'm going to say here const
81:34 - and i'm going to say here
81:36 - pickup
81:39 - i'm going to say set pickup
81:41 - good
81:43 - oops not
81:44 - brackets like these actually just close
81:47 - brackets like these
81:48 - set pickup is equal to
81:51 - what
81:52 - use state
81:57 - that's right use state and so far it's
81:59 - nothing don't worry so far it's an empty
82:01 - string right
82:02 - and then we'll say same thing it's going
82:04 - to copy this section
82:07 - paste this section in and simply drop
82:09 - off
82:11 - drop off
82:12 - and we'll say set drop off
82:18 - boom so save that too
82:21 - okay save it beautiful
82:24 - so pick up and drop off we have these
82:26 - two things and so far it's nothing okay
82:28 - for us to be able to how do we go ahead
82:30 - and now take these data or how do we put
82:32 - everything inside the input into here
82:34 - that's a good question maybe get
82:35 - somebody guess what do we do guys maybe
82:37 - you guys can guess what do we do
82:39 - what do we do i want you guys to stick a
82:40 - gas really good
82:42 - really good guess you guys can do this
82:45 - not props
82:46 - no
82:48 - well actually it is kind of like props
82:49 - into the input it's kind of like props
82:50 - that's right
82:52 - value emmerich that's right good job
82:54 - emeric it's called value
82:58 - so i'm going to give you guys some
82:59 - pointers right here say emrick
83:01 - it's a fire
83:02 - good job
83:03 - all right
83:05 - inside here i'm going to say the
83:06 - following let's go ahead and do
83:08 - placeholder good
83:10 - then inside here and say value the value
83:12 - of this input guys is going to be the
83:13 - value of whatever is inside this pickup
83:17 - okay value is going to be pick up that's
83:20 - the u state and now the va seems gonna
83:22 - be with the drop off guys
83:24 - with the input drop off
83:26 - okay
83:27 - this out the value of this one
83:29 - is also going to be you know
83:32 - drop off but
83:35 - it's still not going to work because
83:37 - this will only be the value of you know
83:39 - empty string we need to be able to
83:41 - update every time we type as you type
83:43 - right as you tap on the keyboard as i'm
83:45 - like as i'm here as i'm typing
83:48 - i can't even do look i can't even do it
83:50 - right because the value is always an
83:52 - empty string guys always
83:55 - so there's an on change gosh this out
83:57 - there's an on change
83:59 - is equal to
84:01 - on the change of when you typing we want
84:03 - to be able to change it using set pickup
84:05 - so let's check this out i'm going to do
84:07 - like this
84:09 - okay
84:10 - and here there's a something we get
84:13 - passed in just just follow along with me
84:14 - it's called e it's an event so every
84:16 - time you type something it emits in the
84:19 - event in the browser and so that's what
84:21 - we can use and i say here
84:24 - set
84:25 - pickup
84:27 - to e dot target that value
84:33 - yes
84:34 - that's so cool
84:36 - not r e sorry
84:38 - okay
84:39 - separate enter the value so whenever i
84:41 - enter because let's check it out okay
84:43 - let's check it out i will go and console
84:45 - my logo so log the actual
84:48 - pickup let's see
84:51 - the log
84:53 - pickup
84:54 - save it
84:55 - okay
84:56 - good okay let's go and watch our thing
85:00 - watch this happen guys boom
85:04 - hey you guys can see it's actually
85:06 - showing what i'm typing right whatever
85:08 - i'm typing it's showing in the console
85:09 - because that's the data right we're
85:11 - updating this pickup state yeah called
85:14 - you state right state management
85:16 - whenever we type something in same thing
85:18 - happens with the drop off as well so
85:20 - let's try that on change
85:23 - right here i'm gonna copy this whole
85:24 - thing copy pasta
85:26 - pasta into here and then eat the pasta
85:30 - who likes pasta guys give me some fire
85:31 - for the pasta guys you guys like pasta
85:33 - if you guys like pasta guys please give
85:36 - it that fire because i love pasta
85:38 - yes it passes amazing
85:41 - drop off
85:42 - all right cool right so guys we've got
85:45 - the drop-off we got the pickup all is
85:47 - good there let's see if i can store luck
85:49 - you know let's just see now i find a
85:50 - console.log
85:51 - i solo log pick and now i say drop off
85:55 - okay boom boom boom

91:41 - change the value pick up in dropbox it
91:42 - is kind of there so guys remember our
91:45 - pickup and drop off gets here
91:48 - now it's at the user factor you know how
91:50 - we call these functions well we need to
91:52 - call them inside use effect so
91:55 - whenever the pickup changes and the
91:58 - drop-off changes
92:01 - need to pass them into here pick up
92:04 - and drop off
92:07 - sorry
92:08 - drop off right here
92:09 - pass them both into here we are still
92:11 - not using them because why technically
92:14 - they're kind of just right here right so
92:16 - we have to add this parameter so let's
92:17 - go ahead and do instead of doing here we
92:20 - need to can remove this whole thing
92:22 - just add the parameters pick up
92:25 - remove this whole drop off add this
92:28 - parameters drop off
92:31 - okay and now let's see what's gonna
92:33 - happen here so let's see i'm gonna show
92:34 - it to you okay
92:35 - basically the pick up and drop will come
92:37 - from the search page
92:39 - okay we'll go into here actually it will
92:41 - yeah it will actually no at first it
92:43 - will go into the
92:44 - props right this query right here right
92:46 - into the url
92:47 - from that point on
92:49 - right it will go to here
92:51 - okay and from that point on we're going
92:53 - to pass this data into let's just say
92:55 - let's just say this drop off this
92:56 - drop-off gets passed into this function
92:59 - and then it's used inside here that's a
93:01 - difference guys okay so now if i refresh
93:03 - this page technically it should

122:45 - right and let's see if i save this guys
122:48 - it says can't resolve
122:51 - [Music]
122:54 - maybe dylan was right
122:57 - let's say can't resolve b data car list
123:05 - let's see there's a typo in line three
123:08 - it should be data but not b data
123:11 - line three
123:13 - oh how did this get there my bad devlin
123:16 - i'm sorry my friend just you got this
123:18 - sorry
123:20 - here
123:22 - import
123:24 - yeah i'll do it again
123:26 - okay thank you guys appreciate that
123:29 - mvp there we go you guys got this okay b
123:32 - data you saved the day oh let's go so
123:35 - look at this guys we've got all these
123:37 - files give us that fire that's what
123:39 - we're talking about we've got these
123:40 - specific right we're looping through
123:42 - every single one of them now we do have
123:44 - an error right here
123:45 - not an error it's just something that vs
123:47 - code is telling us to do it says missing
123:49 - key prop the reason why is because every
123:50 - time you look through something it's
123:52 - like it's like imagine you know you as a
123:54 - person there's a lot of people out there
123:55 - in the world same thing to you right
123:57 - you're on currently zoom you guys have
123:59 - individual names well when you loop
124:01 - through something every element right
124:03 - here
124:05 - should have individual name as well
124:07 - that's what it likes to see right that's
124:09 - why it gives you this right here right
124:10 - it should have individual name so to
124:12 - give an individual name we use something
124:13 - called key key is equal to what is the
124:16 - key we need to give it specifically
124:18 - that's right fabio i'm gonna give it oh
124:19 - fabio nice job
124:21 - i'm gonna give you some fire for this
124:22 - one fabio good job
124:26 - good job fabio
124:28 - it's a key i'm going to say key is equal
124:30 - to not car but it's actually going to be
124:31 - comma index
124:33 - because when we loop for something we
124:35 - also get the index i'm going to say key
124:36 - is equal to index
124:40 - okay and look you see now it's gone
124:42 - beautiful now it's gone and so now we
124:44 - can be smart about this okay instead of
124:45 - having this uberx always be there we can
124:48 - use the data that's coming directly from
124:50 - the data the cardless.js right and
124:52 - that's going to be service to the south
124:54 - see the service well why can't we use it
124:57 - every time we're looping through it i'm
124:59 - going to say here
125:00 - car instead of doing uberx i'm going to
125:02 - say boom
125:04 - boom car dot service
125:08 - so let's see it guys watch the change oh
125:11 - right here that's right now what about
125:13 - the image url okay now somebody tell me
125:15 - i'll give you guys i'll give you guys a
125:17 - pointer as well what do i change this to
125:19 - to use the one and it needs to be a full
125:21 - thing
125:23 - to use the one directly from the the
125:26 - actual card
125:28 - what is it sam you got it you sam that's
125:30 - right sam i'll give sam as well oh my
125:32 - god you guys are killing it today
125:38 - sam good job
125:40 - sam good job as well nice job so inside
125:43 - here i'm going to say here
125:45 - source
125:46 - boom let's say car dot
125:49 - image url like this save it oh
125:52 - look at this guys we've got our images
125:54 - right here beautiful just like that guys
125:56 - guy right so really really really cool
125:59 - so at this point we've got what we need
126:01 - it okay we've got what we needed that's
126:02 - the whole point here
126:04 - now you see how it kind of stretched out
126:06 - this whole thing which i just i'm not a
126:08 - big fan of it's not i'm not a big fan of
126:10 - why like why it kind of does that i
126:12 - don't understand why it does
126:15 - i mean i do but this is not 50 anymore
126:18 - and neither is this so to change that
126:21 - what i'm going to do is the following i
126:22 - will go ahead and go to mymap.js
126:24 - and i will go to the css and i will say
126:27 - hey
126:28 - for you i'm going to say the height is
126:30 - going to be 1-2 so the height is half of
126:32 - the page
126:33 - 50
126:35 - okay then i'm going to go back to the
126:37 - right selector and inside here the right
126:39 - selector i will say oh tool not sorry
126:41 - the confirm page
126:43 - i will say for this
126:44 - right here i'm going to say this is
126:45 - going to be h
126:47 - dash one now just to give you guys some
126:48 - context
126:50 - this right container is this whole thing
126:53 - okay
126:54 - it's this whole thing
126:55 - the map is this whole thing
126:57 - i made it so that the map is fifty
127:00 - percent and this right here is also
127:03 - fifty percent you guys see that yes or
127:05 - no give me a thumbs up if you guys do
127:09 - yes
127:10 - yes or no yeah
127:13 - so that's what i'm doing here
127:17 - okay good good good good good
127:20 - after that okay i'm gonna save this
127:24 - but you see now it's like an issue
127:25 - because now it's scrolls for some reason
127:27 - so to prevent it from scrolling properly
127:29 - what i'm going to do is i need to do
127:31 - overfly overflow y scroll okay i'll go
127:34 - back to my right selector here
127:37 - and on the on the actual wrapper of this
127:41 - thing i'm going to say overflow
127:45 - overflow so basically when there's
127:46 - overflow i say overflow dash y
127:48 - dash scroll
127:52 - a you can see now now we can scroll i'm
127:54 - going to be even smarter with this i
127:56 - want to scroll only inside
127:58 - here i want to keep this up top so what
128:00 - i'm going to do is inside the car list i
128:02 - will say overflow scroll
128:06 - for flow and what this does is it tells
128:08 - hey if there's too many items that go
128:10 - above the actual data then just scroll
128:12 - it
128:15 - and now if we hey wait hold on
128:19 - let me
128:20 - see
128:22 - no still does not look just the way i
128:24 - think it's because of this let's go back
128:26 - to our car list here i think it's the
128:28 - wrapper the wrapper needs to be flexed
128:30 - actually
128:32 - there we go
128:33 - because uh the reason we make this work
128:35 - we want to make the wrapper flex and
128:37 - then we do flex column
128:40 - goes up to bottom and now you see there
128:42 - you go so now that means this item is on
128:44 - the top i'm going to remove this stuff
128:46 - it means this item is always on the top
128:48 - oops
128:49 - this is always on the top and then this
128:50 - right here scrolls and there you go
128:54 - so guys there we go this is what we got
128:57 - so so far we've got this
128:59 - so far we have this
129:03 - what do you think so far
129:05 - huh
129:06 - what do you think so far
129:08 - yeah
129:11 - so guys
129:13 - okay
129:15 - the next thing i want to do i mean
129:19 - pretty much we've done this done all
129:21 - these things

129:32 - want to do part 11
129:33 - 11 is going to be i want to go ahead and
129:36 - actually calculate the price calculate

129:39 - location of this right so but if you
