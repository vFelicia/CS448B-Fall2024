00:00 - are you looking to get a job as a
00:01 - developer well guess what we're taking
00:03 - five people this month and helping them
00:05 - get placed as a software developer but
00:08 - here's the catch I have a challenge for
00:09 - you that you need to solve welcome to
00:12 - the squid game for developers challenge
00:13 - all these people you see over here some
00:15 - of them have passed but a lot of these
00:17 - people have been eliminated so for
00:19 - example we had Luis Menendez who's a
00:21 - lead front-end engineer applied to this
00:23 - from three pillar Global we've had
00:25 - narcissus Marin cat who's a CTO at
00:27 - hereology participate in the squid games
00:30 - challenge we have had Muhammad sad
00:32 - Mateen apply to this who's a lead
00:34 - developer at solution founder
00:35 - information Technologies so whether
00:37 - you're a complete beginner or you're
00:39 - more advanced this challenge is for you
00:41 - now we've tried to make this challenge
00:43 - as doable as possible for you so it's
00:46 - going to prove that you have skill and
00:48 - this challenge will show that you are
00:50 - somebody who can either get their first
00:51 - job or if you're more intermediate or
00:53 - Advanced you should be able to kind of
00:54 - Breeze through it quicker so we're
00:56 - judging people on the relying into this
00:58 - program is can you actually communicate
01:00 - and share your ideas and thoughts as
01:02 - you're solving the coding problem are
01:04 - you somebody who has the coding skills
01:07 - you have resourcefulness are you
01:09 - googling and stack overflowing stuff as
01:11 - necessary to solve the problem and the
01:13 - test and the challenge that we're going
01:14 - to give you you can use all of those
01:16 - things we don't want to make it a
01:18 - whiteboard nerdy you're sitting behind a
01:20 - desk and trying to solve something
01:21 - because I don't think it does a good job
01:23 - of telling you whether you're the right
01:25 - person or not we're looking for Builders
01:28 - if you have the ambition to build and
01:29 - that excites you we're looking for you
01:31 - we have our own unique process that
01:33 - we're using to qualify developers one is
01:35 - going to be really fun two it's gonna be
01:37 - something that allows you to build and
01:40 - show off your skills in Google and try
01:42 - everything whereas in other places you
01:46 - can't Google stuff and they don't allow
01:47 - you to stack Overflow and this and
01:49 - they'll look down upon it and that's no
01:51 - developer develops like that 90 of
01:53 - coding is research and 10 is actually
01:55 - sitting there and writing code in any
01:57 - real software developer will actually
01:58 - tell you that you might be able to to
02:00 - build something but you might not be
02:01 - able to solve a recursive Fibonacci
02:04 - solution now for the challenge you're
02:05 - going to start with a JavaScript
02:07 - algorithms warm up so it's going to be a
02:09 - couple of JavaScript algo questions so
02:11 - we're keeping that stuff pretty simple
02:12 - so as long as you know some JavaScript
02:14 - you'll be good promise you we're not
02:16 - reversing any linked lists here second
02:18 - we're going to give you some front-end
02:20 - challenges which means you're going to
02:22 - be building somewhat of an app and
02:23 - you're going to be figuring it out
02:25 - because again we're trying to curate a
02:27 - community of builders that is the
02:29 - ultimate goal as well of this so one of
02:32 - course we can help you get a job but two
02:34 - so all of the builders are in one place
02:36 - together you might found the SAS
02:38 - tomorrow you might actually build apps
02:40 - tomorrow together who knows or you might
02:42 - just build amazing relationships with
02:45 - other people and other developers who
02:47 - are Builders and love building but only
02:49 - once you pass the trial of fire the test
02:53 - that finds out who you are and finds out
02:57 - if you're a real developer or not
03:00 - all right now you've heard everything
03:02 - there is to hear at this point all you
03:04 - have to do is put your name email phone
03:06 - number and you're pretty much ready to
03:08 - get started you're gonna click that
03:09 - button to go now if you're wondering and
03:11 - you've been wondering what that timer
03:12 - above this video is that's how much time
03:16 - you have left for this challenge once
03:19 - that timer runs out you'll never see
03:21 - this challenge again good luck
