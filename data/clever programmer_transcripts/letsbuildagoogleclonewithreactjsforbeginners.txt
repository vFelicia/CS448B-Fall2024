00:02 - to see you all
00:04 - guys i hope you are excited because
00:06 - today we're gonna be building the google
00:08 - clone
00:09 - what's absolutely insane about this

00:33 - and hit enter it didn't even refresh
00:38 - and you're here exactly and this is
00:41 - actually using the google
00:43 - uh custom search api so this is actually
00:46 - real google results so you can see even
00:48 - there we want like four trillion results
00:50 - that come up it actually shows you uh
00:52 - the exact value so it's actually pulling
00:54 - this from google guys

03:31 - actually
03:32 - on this build and there are some amazing
03:34 - things that you're going to be learning
03:35 - in this build and we're going to share
03:37 - all of them
03:38 - with you in just a second all right so
03:41 - for sunny
03:42 - go ahead smash that like button uh thank
03:44 - you for the first donation
03:46 - and let's start talking about what uh
03:48 - this project is gonna cover so sunny
03:50 - what are we covering in this i know you
03:52 - said we're gonna be using context api
03:54 - which is kind of like
03:55 - redux and people are gonna be learning
03:56 - about that type of concept what else are
03:59 - we going to be covering
04:01 - so we're going to be using material ui
04:04 - for
04:04 - the icons and a lot of the design work
04:07 - so let me just pop that in
04:09 - so icons like this okay got it
04:12 - exactly those icons are coming straight
04:14 - from material ui which is google's
04:16 - design library
04:17 - and we're also going to be using react
04:19 - router so this is going to be something
04:20 - super powerful and useful
04:21 - for you guys to learn and this is how we
04:24 - go from the search
04:25 - page to that search results page right
04:28 - so we go how we go from this page
04:29 - to that search results page um and then
04:33 - we're going to be actually using an
04:34 - external api today so we're using
04:36 - google's custom
04:37 - search api and that's how we're getting
04:39 - all of that crazy functionality
04:41 - that you guys are seeing right now when
04:44 - you search something and you're actually
04:45 - pulling
04:46 - live information from google yeah so
04:48 - we're using actual google's official api
04:50 - and we're going to show you guys how to
04:51 - do that
04:52 - uh and then we're also actually we're
04:53 - actually doing something we've never
04:55 - done in a build
04:56 - before we're building our own custom
04:58 - hook today guys
05:00 - which is super cool all right so we all
05:02 - know about react hooks and if you don't
05:04 - you're going to find out what react
05:05 - hooks are in today's video
05:07 - but we actually went ahead and built our
05:08 - built our own custom hook today
05:10 - which is going to help us pull that
05:12 - information from the servers
05:15 - nice beautiful and then are we using
05:18 - firebase for anything yes
05:22 - so we're using five to set up the app we
05:24 - need to use fiber to set up the app so
05:26 - that we can connect it to google
05:28 - and then we're going to be using
05:29 - firebase deployment uh voice hosting to
05:32 - deploy our
05:39 - wow that is that those are a lot of
05:42 - things that we're going to be covering
05:43 - is there anything else that
05:45 - actually should add to the list sunny or
05:47 - this cover pretty much everything we're
05:48 - going to learn
05:50 - uh this is pretty much everything this
05:52 - is pretty much everything yeah
05:54 - oh we've got a bunch of flexbox guys a
05:56 - huge amount of flexboxes in today's
05:58 - video as well

07:23 - we're using vs4 livestream we've been
07:25 - doing this in every single one of our
07:26 - builds
07:27 - um so that me and kazi can code side by

08:04 - going to do
08:04 - we're just going to create this app yep
08:08 - we're going to create the react app and
08:10 - this is going to be

08:35 - keep the fire going nice thank you so
08:39 - much for everyone we appreciate you
08:41 - yeah awesome all right so we one
08:44 - while this is setting up guys we use
08:46 - create react app to get oh we got
08:47 - another donation nice
08:49 - shree swaminathan banasari i don't know
08:52 - if i spend that right because as you
08:53 - guys are awesome
08:54 - your live videos keep me motivated and
08:56 - energized nice
08:57 - damn thank you for that donate damn this
09:00 - is lit
09:01 - we're already starting out with banger
09:03 - donations thank you guys so much
09:05 - really appreciate it okay so this is
09:08 - where wow yep the app is being made
09:12 - right now so what should we do should we
09:14 - do firebase right now
09:17 - yeah so we're gonna need to set up
09:18 - firebase so that we can connect it to
09:20 - google
09:21 - and so that we can host it online okay
09:24 - cool
09:25 - yep all right here we go
09:34 - all right so we just hit over 750 views
09:37 - this is
09:37 - 750 live people right now that's crazy
09:40 - dude
09:40 - yeah that is absolutely insane
09:45 - so now guys you want to all you need is
09:47 - a gmail account to get started you want
09:48 - to go ahead and hit
09:50 - the add project button put in something
09:52 - like google dash clone
09:53 - to get started and then it will ask you
09:55 - if you need analytics you can just take
09:57 - yes or no depending on if you're
09:58 - interested in that but it's not really a
10:00 - major thing at that point
10:02 - but once this goes it hasn't get done
10:03 - the reason why we need to do this now is
10:05 - because this is we're not using the
10:06 - database today we're going to be using
10:07 - the
10:08 - hosting so this is actually going to be
10:10 - this is how you guys saw the website
10:12 - and this is how kazi was able to access
10:14 - the website from all the way in la
10:15 - because i deployed it online and then
10:17 - you can basically go ahead and go on it
10:19 - right
10:20 - so and then also we this will allow us
10:23 - to get
10:23 - our google custom search api key which
10:26 - we're going to be using
10:27 - later on in the build so now that that's
10:29 - done
10:30 - we'll still connecting a bunch of stuff
10:33 - uh
10:34 - we're still waiting for the build to
10:35 - finish and yeah perfect just finished
10:37 - nice yeah so let's go ahead and set up
10:39 - yeah
10:40 - all right so let's go ahead and i'm
10:43 - gonna go
10:44 - uh no we're done at this point on
10:46 - firebase got it okay we'll come back to
10:48 - this later
10:49 - all right awesome oh thank you for oh

11:45 - becoming a javascript developer so i
11:47 - know a lot of you guys are trying to
11:48 - learn
11:49 - because let's just talk for one second
11:50 - why you're doing this why you're even

11:53 - and a lot of you people that are
11:55 - learning this is you want to add it to
11:57 - your portfolio
11:58 - and most of the people that we know
12:01 - sunny are trying to use these
12:02 - programming skills to get jobs

12:08 - right that jumped on and said hey i
12:09 - landed 6 700
12:10 - client so the whole point of this
12:14 - training that i have put together for
12:15 - you guys

12:26 - bring you a lot of value and with that
12:28 - said let's keep going and man we just
12:30 - had
12:30 - two other amazing donations thank you
12:34 - yeah i'm gonna just pop them up and the
12:36 - first one it says you guys are amazing
12:38 - for me
12:39 - so meet yep yeah you deserve to be on
12:42 - time
12:44 - nice and the next one can you guys
12:46 - please build a medium clone
12:48 - yeah sure we can that's actually a good
12:50 - idea but on the way to build everything
12:52 - yeah really good idea yeah medium is
12:55 - actually a good idea we should do that
12:57 - yeah okay so let's keep let's keep it
13:00 - now going
13:01 - so boom we got the firebase uh set up
13:03 - correctly
13:04 - and this is the app over here on the
13:06 - right hand side and then on the left
13:08 - hand side the
13:09 - thing is built so i'm just going to cd
13:11 - into it and then we can go ahead and get
13:13 - started now what i'm going to do is i'm
13:14 - going to do npm
13:15 - start npm start so on the right hand
13:19 - side
13:20 - the local host should pop up with the
13:22 - react logo spinning
13:24 - that essentially just means that our app
13:26 - that we just built on localhost is up
13:29 - and running
13:29 - and then we're gonna do a few things for
13:31 - the regular cleanup process that we
13:33 - normally
13:34 - do so here we can see this app
13:37 - is already running you guys now what i
13:40 - want to do
13:40 - is grab the logo grab the test and grab
13:44 - this test file here
13:45 - and delete it because just to clean it
13:47 - up a little bit because we don't need
13:48 - that right now
13:50 - and then we're going to go in app.js and
13:53 - it'll delete this line
13:54 - because that's what it's giving an error
13:55 - about and
13:57 - then let me go full screen here real
14:00 - quick
14:00 - and we're going to delete everything
14:02 - that's inside of the headers and
14:04 - i'm just going to go h1 and here
14:07 - we are building so let's say hey clever
14:10 - programmer fam let's build
14:15 - the google clone
14:20 - another donation thank you so much psy
14:22 - really appreciate it i'm gonna hit save
14:24 - here
14:24 - yeah and you guys can see that this app
14:28 - is now up and running it is showing
14:31 - our everything that we want to look at
14:33 - but what it's
14:35 - not what i don't like about it right now
14:36 - is that it has some styling kind of
14:38 - built into it so
14:39 - this is like centered and then also we
14:42 - have a little margin
14:43 - so we can just go ahead and get rid of
14:45 - that so let's go over here
14:48 - into our app.css and i'm just going to
14:50 - remove everything
14:52 - now when i hit save you'll see that i
14:54 - got removed of that centers you know how
14:56 - i was centering it and now it's just all
14:58 - left aligned and kind of default
15:00 - and then i'm going to go in my index.css
15:03 - and i want to remove that invisible
15:04 - margin
15:05 - that uh react often adds by default a
15:09 - margin of 10.
15:10 - so we're gonna just go ahead and give it
15:12 - give everything
15:14 - a margin of zero like this wow lots of
15:17 - donations come in
15:18 - you guys thank you gopi thank you romel
15:19 - for five dollars
15:21 - and um thank you buscar so i'm going to
15:25 - hit save right
15:26 - here now you saw that that
15:30 - margin actually just went away okay so
15:32 - i'm going to hit undo here so just
15:34 - just so you guys can actually see it
15:36 - happen live
15:37 - right and you saw that that margin now
15:39 - is gone
15:40 - i'm going to go back to my app.js for
15:44 - bam naming convention i'm going to lower
15:45 - case this
15:46 - i'll write that down here and with that
15:49 - said
15:49 - we're pretty much now ready to get
15:51 - started this is usually the cleanup
15:53 - process that you guys have seen
15:54 - multiple times already and uh let's
15:57 - continue
16:00 - that was dope dude that was a nice
16:02 - little entry there
16:03 - so nice once you get to this point guys
16:07 - you have a really nice clean starting
16:09 - template that you can work from so
16:11 - once we have this up and running what i
16:13 - like to do is
16:14 - get everything essentially sort of
16:16 - drafted out right so everything kind of
16:18 - should be a little bit drafted out
16:20 - so let's go ahead and just do a rough
16:23 - draft so we're going to have two pages
16:24 - in this app
16:25 - all right we're going to have a the home
16:27 - page and this is going to be
16:29 - the one with the search on right so this
16:32 - is
16:33 - going to be the one with the search on
16:34 - so start and then we're gonna before you
16:35 - continue before you continue
16:37 - all right so i just want to visualize
16:39 - everything sunny is saying because
16:41 - i love visuals and i hope you guys enjoy
16:44 - them as much as i do
16:45 - but sunny is about to like write all the
16:47 - components out here
16:48 - in comments so the home
16:51 - over here is essentially you're
16:53 - referring to this entire page here right
16:57 - exactly yeah got it okay so that's the
17:00 - home
17:00 - exactly i'm on board with you so let's
17:02 - go to the next thing
17:05 - yeah they're awesome so we have the home
17:07 - page and then we have the
17:09 - search page right so the search page
17:12 - like this right
17:13 - and this is going to be essentially the
17:15 - results page
17:16 - so this is where we have all the search
17:17 - results so let me type in something like
17:20 - uh let's type in joe rogan
17:25 - okay so let's go back boom i think
17:29 - you might have done the api i know i
17:31 - know
17:32 - yeah i think so yeah yeah
17:35 - right so in that case yes so this will
17:37 - be the results page that you would see
17:39 - right so this would be
17:40 - definitely pretty much it so it's this
17:42 - page let's just show it over here so
17:44 - let's i mean let me
17:45 - write in joe rogan so it'll be this page
17:47 - over here you guys
17:49 - it'll be this page okay yeah
17:56 - okay quite good there's so cause you're
18:05 - second broadcast just donated two
18:07 - dollars and he says this is awesome
18:09 - waiting for the day you guys do twitch
18:12 - let's go nice let's go
18:16 - we've also actually opened the other day
18:18 - we've been difficult to
18:20 - so you're interested in that no sunny
18:23 - your internet is
18:24 - acting really bad my friend you might
18:27 - want to just
18:28 - quit kill your video and i don't know
18:31 - maybe tell people in your house to stop
18:32 - using internet
18:36 - still bad now i can hear the audio a
18:39 - little bit better right
18:42 - what i might do is if we take questions
18:44 - for five minutes like just do five
18:46 - minutes and then i'll uh i'll quickly
18:48 - restart
18:48 - you're actually you're actually sounding
18:50 - a lot better right now by the way
18:52 - maybe maybe later maybe try it later
18:55 - yeah all right cool so we've got the
18:57 - search page now here
18:59 - um so we have the homepage and the
19:00 - search page and also kazi if you go back
19:02 - to
19:03 - the deployed version now uh-huh
19:07 - so let's go and then refresh it but do a
19:09 - hard refresh
19:11 - okay hard refresh
19:14 - yeah now what i've done is i've got a
19:18 - masked response so if you type in
19:20 - something like um
19:23 - type in tesla for example and hit enter
19:27 - yep nice go ahead and hit so you see now
19:30 - i'm pulling like rather than doing it's
19:32 - not going to be tesla but what i did
19:34 - is i pulled a like a default response so
19:38 - it doesn't ping the database every time
19:39 - it's ping the google search
19:41 - so that way you can develop with this
19:43 - result so this is just a sort of good
19:44 - idea
19:45 - for yeah just so you guys know like
19:47 - behind the scenes why this is happening
19:49 - is we're
19:49 - doing it in a way where we have a limit
19:51 - of a hundred requests
19:53 - and what actually has happened is people
19:55 - who are watching this live stream right
19:56 - now
19:57 - when on the url that's up there and spam
20:00 - the search
20:01 - to be over 100 requests and that's why
20:04 - it didn't open earlier so that's why
20:05 - sunny just built that like mass response
20:07 - and now it's good to go
20:09 - and viral just dropped freaking damn
20:12 - thank you viral that is huge
20:14 - viral just said we're all just dropped

22:24 - um at some point it's not on the agenda
22:27 - for this upcoming week
22:28 - but definitely today we just want to
22:30 - focus in on this google app that you
22:32 - guys
22:32 - are going to be building and then we
22:34 - have a few big clones lined up one of
22:36 - them is discord
22:38 - because i know a lot of you guys keep
22:39 - asking for it and then we're also gonna
22:42 - add new technologies like node.js
22:45 - node.js
22:46 - and start teaching as mongodb and i know
22:49 - a lot of you are trying to learn those
22:51 - skills as well
22:54 - behind me right now is actually frankie
22:57 - and
22:58 - i want to show you guys a little bit
22:59 - behind the scenes some of you guys might
23:01 - have known that we got a new place
23:03 - so this is actually our current studio
23:05 - setup
23:06 - right now so this is a new place that we
23:09 - have gotten
23:10 - for a clever programmer we call this the
23:12 - team cp mansion we can probably call it
23:14 - the high pass or the drip house
23:17 - you know but
23:20 - this is the studio and we're trying to
23:22 - set it up and this is actually where i'm
23:24 - live streaming and even if you see right
23:25 - now i have that cup of coffee that you
23:27 - saw in that photo
23:28 - i have that in my hands right now so
23:30 - this picture was actually taken today
23:34 - and um damn everybody says that's so
23:38 - sick
23:38 - thank you hey all right i think
23:42 - yo boy he's back that's better
23:46 - maybe just uh you can leave the video on
23:49 - yes give it a go all right let's go
23:52 - let's go so sunny is back i'm showing
23:55 - them my studio right now
23:57 - so let me actually share the screen with
23:58 - you too so you can see it
24:01 - so this is what the studio is looking
24:02 - like right now dude check it out
24:06 - oh dope holy crap that's nice dude yeah
24:09 - it's gonna get better but all right so
24:12 - let's keep going i was basically showing
24:15 - yo pick up homie that you said that yeah
24:18 - yeah
24:18 - that's hilarious it's kind of like
24:21 - how i imagine your ghost would be if you
24:24 - actually died
24:25 - i think you would speak to me through
24:26 - react comments that's how i think you
24:29 - would talk to it
24:30 - and like i would just see like you know
24:32 - freaking i would be like
24:33 - coding and react and i'll just see
24:35 - something like this and be like
24:38 - you're the best quasi i'm still here bro
24:41 - i'm still here
24:45 - you'll be like you're you'll be like
24:47 - you're not following them
24:48 - holy crap i was gonna just say that bro
24:50 - i was just gonna say that
24:54 - oh i peeked and broke some people's ears
24:56 - probably
24:57 - that's so funny damn good guys we're
25:00 - back
25:01 - all right we're back we're back to jump
25:03 - in the build let's go
25:05 - so talk to me what's going on here and
25:07 - let's keep going bro
25:09 - let's do it so now what we do is usually
25:12 - guys
25:12 - what we do is we i like to drop things
25:14 - out uh in a component layout right
25:17 - but today what we're doing is i'm
25:18 - actually going to show you how you can
25:20 - lay out your
25:21 - project in like in in pages and in
25:24 - components
25:25 - right so this is going to help you break
25:26 - down your projects and it's actually how
25:28 - they do it
25:29 - in a professional environment so it's
25:31 - going to be some good experience for you
25:32 - guys today
25:33 - so let's go ahead and go to our uh
25:36 - folders i can't see our photos for some
25:38 - reason oh man
25:39 - all right let's see this should load in
25:40 - a sec um
25:42 - yeah so kazi if i'll just run you
25:44 - through this as and i'll rejoin
25:45 - the live share so basically go to uh you
25:48 - want to go to
25:49 - your folders in source add a folder
25:52 - called pages
25:54 - all right yes i had a photo called
25:57 - i'll call i call i'll add a folder
25:59 - called pages
26:01 - all right dude all types of technical
26:03 - difficulties are happening it's kind of
26:04 - crazy my tv just shut down
26:06 - frank you want to help with that and uh
26:08 - all right let's keep going
26:10 - so paige it says it says the live i
26:12 - think you need to
26:14 - uh restart a live show because it says
26:17 - the host is offline yeah but basically
26:19 - we're gonna have pages
26:20 - and then we're gonna have components and
26:22 - we're to break things down into
26:24 - separate pages and break things down
26:25 - into separate components
26:28 - can you not you can't see it right now
26:30 - because it is live
26:31 - shared so maybe it just says it says the
26:34 - host of the work say
26:35 - seems to be offline so i think maybe
26:36 - what we'll do is if you press command
26:38 - shift p
26:39 - all right so let me actually go ahead
26:41 - and do that command shift p
26:43 - and let me add you to this screen over
26:45 - here so everybody can see oh let me
26:47 - actually flip that around boom
26:48 - boom there we go all right so command
26:51 - shift p and what else
26:53 - yeah and then type in uh live live share
26:56 - and stop
26:58 - so i think it'll be live share and stop
27:02 - okay so stop stop collaboration session
27:05 - exactly and then restart another one
27:09 - that should kick you out somebody just
27:11 - said they landed a job by the way from
27:13 - our like
27:14 - face detection clone no way
27:20 - see all right there we go oh nice i just
27:22 - got your message
27:23 - there you go so let's go ahead
27:27 - yes i can see yeah all right we survived
27:30 - that
27:31 - we survived that hopefully you're good
27:33 - are you in here
27:35 - i am in here i'm waiting for the file
27:38 - tree to load up
27:39 - it says opening session and we're in hey
27:42 - nice
27:42 - beautiful yeah there you go you got
27:44 - pages right here yep
27:46 - nice so with that said
27:49 - let's go ahead and do the following so
27:52 - let me get rid of this comment
27:54 - there we go so uh now we've got pages
27:56 - right so what we're going to do now is
27:58 - we're going to have pages and we're also
27:59 - going to create another folder and i'm
28:01 - going to call this one
28:02 - components right so this one's going to
28:04 - be pages and components
28:06 - and the reason why we're going to do
28:07 - this so if you
28:10 - open up your uh yeah there we go we've
28:11 - got pages and components
28:13 - and the components are going to be
28:14 - reusable components like we know right
28:16 - so we're going to refer to things like
28:18 - the search bar as a component
28:20 - but the pages are going to refer to the
28:22 - home page
28:23 - and the search page right so this is
28:26 - something which they actually do in
28:27 - professional environments
28:28 - i thought it was a good project to show
28:29 - you on this right so the first one that
28:31 - we're going to do is we're going to
28:32 - actually go ahead and build the home
28:34 - page
28:34 - right so i'm going to go ahead and type
28:36 - in home and what we're going to do is
28:38 - cause if you want to build the first
28:39 - component and then after that we can
28:41 - streamline it
28:43 - so let's go ahead and create a new
28:45 - component and we're going to call this
28:46 - one home
28:48 - all right home.js boom yeah
28:51 - and then we're going to use a really
28:52 - nice trick here guys and it's called
28:54 - rfce and it's from es7 snippet so that's
28:57 - an extension
28:58 - that's going to allow you to do what
28:59 - kazi just did and you just type in rfce
29:02 - and you get all of that code just pop
29:03 - out for you so once we do that we're
29:05 - going to basically get used to setting
29:07 - our apps up like this so it's going to
29:08 - be
29:09 - cast name home i'm also going to create
29:11 - a see a
29:12 - css file for this we're going to say
29:13 - import
29:15 - home dot css like that right and then
29:18 - i'm going to create
29:19 - the css file for this so notice how this
29:22 - one actually went into the wrong folder
29:25 - so what we're going to do now to fix
29:26 - this
29:27 - is uh we are going to go ahead and move
29:30 - this so we're going to go ahead and move
29:32 - these two so because if you want to do
29:34 - it so it's visual
29:35 - do what move home and home.css those two
29:38 - files
29:39 - push them into pages all right
29:42 - there we go push them yeah and then
29:45 - click move
29:46 - uh-huh yeah and the reason why we're
29:49 - doing this guys is because it's actually
29:50 - a page
29:51 - right it's not a component it's a page
29:52 - so it is a component but if we're
29:54 - referring to it
29:55 - as one of the pages on on our site so
29:57 - that's that done
29:59 - and what we can do now is go back to
30:00 - app.js and go ahead and import this
30:02 - so i can go ahead and import this like
30:05 - so so i go here and i say import
30:08 - um i think you have to follow me again
30:09 - quasi i'm in app.js now
30:13 - say import home from home like this
30:16 - right
30:17 - so now we have the component being
30:18 - pulled in and let's go ahead and double
30:20 - check that it's actually working so we
30:22 - can say h1
30:23 - so i haven't got my snippets which is
30:24 - fine i say h1 this
30:26 - is home page right like this
30:30 - right and if i save that now we go to
30:32 - 3000
30:33 - let's go ahead and see what's happening
30:35 - here so we can see ahead so now it's
30:37 - saying there's a problem because in the
30:38 - import now we have to do this we have to
30:40 - say
30:41 - forward slash pages home right
30:44 - and we save it there we go nice nice
30:48 - okay right so this is the home right
30:51 - and then what we're gonna also do is
30:52 - have a search page right so we're gonna
30:54 - have a home page and a search page
30:55 - we can leave the search page for now so
30:57 - let's go ahead and build some
30:58 - functionality
30:59 - uh so that way we can get everything up
31:00 - and running uh and then we'll go ahead
31:02 - and so is this technically
31:04 - still a component like home yes yep so
31:07 - it's still a component
31:08 - but your folder structure changes and
31:10 - this is what they kind of
31:11 - do in in production builds so you would
31:14 - have a pages folder
31:16 - and the reason why i thought it was good
31:17 - to bring up because in our coaching
31:18 - course a lot of students ask
31:20 - about this so i think it would be really
31:22 - valuable for everyone
31:24 - um to see another hold on
31:27 - jared says i am proud he goes i'm proud
31:30 - to be
31:31 - one among the 5 000 members who landed a
31:34 - full-time job
31:35 - love you clever programmers um dude
31:37 - that's insane
31:38 - i think we just hit a thousand likes
31:40 - dude damn
31:42 - thank you guys we are at forty dollars
31:44 - in revenue on this
31:46 - a stream thank you guys so much for that
31:48 - that is huge
31:50 - we are over a thousand likes and uh
31:52 - we're so pumped because one of our big
31:54 - goals is to get 5 000 people to become
31:57 - developers this year and then
32:01 - next year we want it to be 10 000 or
32:03 - more people to become full-time
32:04 - developers so this
32:05 - is a huge uh this is a huge
32:07 - accomplishment for us thank you
32:09 - for sharing that yeah that's insane love
32:11 - that
32:12 - right so now what we're going to do is
32:14 - in the home page
32:16 - in the home component we're going to go
32:17 - ahead and basically draft out what the
32:19 - home page is
32:20 - right so let's go ahead and do this so
32:23 - now i'm inside the
32:25 - um oops what's going on here so i'm
32:27 - inside the home.js
32:29 - one sec can you see that quasi so let me
32:31 - go ahead and reconnect
32:34 - yeah we'll give it two secs it's just
32:35 - doing a reconnect all kinds of tech
32:37 - today we're fighting against the skies
32:40 - it's
32:41 - a sync issue but we'll get past it it's
32:44 - all good
32:45 - it's impressive how much tech is coming
32:47 - in how many issues we're having
32:50 - exactly all right so you've got the home
32:51 - page now so what we're going to do
32:53 - is in the home page of google we have a
32:56 - header
32:57 - and we have a body right so the header
32:59 - so if we go ahead and pop open our
33:00 - deployed version kazi so let's pop open
33:04 - okay
33:04 - so let's open up the deployed version
33:06 - right here okay
33:07 - so what i'm going to do is draft it out
33:09 - now so we have a header so i'm going to
33:11 - go ahead and say
33:12 - div home um i'm just going to score
33:15 - header
33:16 - like this oh okay i don't get my
33:17 - snippets so i'm going to say div
33:20 - and this one's going to have a class
33:21 - name of home header
33:24 - like this right and then i'm also going
33:27 - to have
33:28 - a another one which is going to be home
33:30 - body
33:31 - right so this is going to be two
33:32 - sections of the web page and we can draw
33:34 - circles around this to show them
33:36 - uh what we're visually doing here so
33:39 - we have the header which is where we see
33:41 - about store
33:42 - gmail images and the user avatar
33:46 - and then we have everything below it so
33:49 - anything below it we're going to call it
33:51 - the body
33:52 - and anything in that top banner we're
33:54 - gonna be referring to
33:55 - as the header okay so hold on just so
33:58 - i'm gonna draw it out visually
33:59 - and sometimes if you're speaking about
34:00 - these things just you can let me know to
34:02 - draw
34:02 - the visuals i'll be your [ __ ] on the
34:04 - live stream that's okay yeah
34:06 - so i i actually did say uh but i'll say
34:09 - it again
34:10 - just wake me up like yo cause you're not
34:12 - paying attention because i'm looking at
34:13 - the
34:14 - comments and everything so when you say
34:16 - header this is what you're referring to
34:18 - yeah
34:19 - yeah exactly okay beautiful and then
34:22 - when you say
34:22 - body is it on everything underneath
34:25 - there
34:26 - so it's this yeah everything underneath
34:29 - we're referring to as the body
34:30 - got it yeah now i always talk about
34:34 - containerizing things because containers
34:36 - allow us to start things easily right
34:38 - so at the top we have like a header left
34:40 - which has about and store
34:42 - and on on the top right we have uh
34:44 - header right so i'm going to go ahead
34:46 - and create
34:47 - and i love this comment by the way this
34:49 - guy goes how goes
34:51 - alert investment the moment these two
34:54 - create a company put
34:55 - all your money and enjoy your retirement
34:57 - within five years
34:59 - hey that's what we're talking about guys
35:01 - that is what we're talking about
35:03 - that's actually 100 uh true like i feel
35:06 - that if we just went hard dude like real
35:09 - talk
35:10 - like we just went all in i do think a
35:12 - lot of people can just invest and retire
35:15 - yeah i think so we can make we can make
35:18 - tipple come alive
35:19 - yeah we will go we go public on the
35:23 - stock market
35:24 - yeah yeah nice so we've got
35:27 - um the header left and header right so
35:29 - here i mean
35:31 - we make tin dev and we're a lot like
35:33 - we're live company
35:35 - yeah exactly tinder oh yeah was it
35:38 - tinder and there's another one
35:39 - um oh yeah two that's so funny
35:43 - all right so we've got a class name here
35:44 - and i'm going to do header left so home
35:46 - underscore underscore header
35:48 - left oops left and then i'm going to
35:51 - copy this
35:52 - so i'm going to go ahead and copy this
35:53 - and i'm going to do header right
35:55 - right so these are going to be basically
35:57 - imagine we're drawing mini containers so
35:59 - now we've got one mini container in the
36:00 - header left and one mini container
36:02 - header right
36:02 - okay then what we're going to do is
36:04 - inside of here we're going to have two
36:06 - links
36:06 - so this is going to be the first link
36:09 - which is going to say that we're going
36:10 - to have two links here
36:11 - and then we're gonna have a link link so
36:14 - this is gonna be the gmail link
36:16 - the images link and then the icon
36:20 - the icon and then the avatar right so
36:23 - i'm gonna go ahead and draft this out so
36:24 - we've got the avatar after that
36:26 - right so how do we get this working now
36:28 - so
36:29 - uh we're going to need a few things to
36:31 - get these links we're going to have to
36:32 - use something called react router
36:34 - and to get these icons and avatars we're
36:36 - going to have to use something called
36:37 - material ui
36:39 - so we're gonna have to install a bunch
36:40 - of dependencies at this point
36:42 - and we do this once and we don't have to
36:43 - do it again so kazi let's go ahead
36:45 - and install material ui to begin with
36:53 - uh you're muted quasi
36:56 - material ui so we gotta do npm install
36:59 - uh you material ui core so i'm just
37:02 - gonna go here
37:03 - open up a new terminal cd in here anyway
37:06 - just
37:07 - paste this and install now next up what
37:10 - we need to do is we need to go to icons
37:12 - now once we're inside here cert click to
37:15 - search the full list of icons
37:18 - and here are going to be all your icons
37:20 - now one more
37:21 - install you guys need to do is if you
37:23 - open up you can open up another one or
37:25 - just wait for the first one to finish
37:27 - change the chord icons this will get you
37:30 - all the
37:30 - icons that you're going to use and why
37:32 - are we using these icons
37:34 - these icons are going to be used for
37:36 - this mic
37:38 - symbol here this search one that right
37:41 - gallery view
37:42 - and a few other things so that's why
37:44 - we're going to need this
37:45 - yeah even the buttons that you saw there
37:47 - where it says google search and i'm
37:48 - feeling lucky are actually being pulled
37:50 - from material ui so they get that nice
37:52 - little ripple effect
37:53 - ah nice so these buttons are coming from
37:55 - material ui so this is not material ui
37:57 - icons but
37:58 - it's still material ui yup
38:01 - dope okay so got it this is how you
38:03 - install it you guys once your
38:04 - installation is done
38:05 - you should be good to go exactly now
38:09 - because you want to show them how we can
38:10 - so
38:11 - yeah also you can just go here and this
38:14 - is the code that you can just copy and
38:16 - paste
38:16 - and you can search for the icons just by
38:18 - typing in whatever you're really looking
38:20 - for so for example here
38:21 - if i want the search i go here type in
38:24 - search hit enter
38:25 - this comes up copy this code go back to
38:27 - my app paste it in
38:29 - right over here and then i can actually
38:31 - use it
38:32 - exactly and that's how when you see me
38:34 - importing a bunch of like icons and
38:36 - stuff like that
38:36 - that's where we're getting them from so
38:38 - if you do get lost at any point
38:40 - know that that's how we found those
38:41 - icons right so with that said
38:43 - we now have material ui so i can go
38:46 - ahead and pop in
38:47 - the icon and the avatar so the icon uh
38:50 - actually before we do that
38:51 - let's go ahead and do one more step so
38:53 - we need to set up react router to get
38:54 - these links
38:55 - all right so i need a few links on the
38:57 - top um so let's go ahead and uh so if
39:00 - you go to react rear on google
39:02 - uh huh let's do it so
39:07 - okay
39:10 - yep so reactor uh and then you're gonna
39:12 - click on web and
39:14 - there should be i think it's yeah there
39:15 - we go in npm install react we're
39:17 - done that's the one we need
39:20 - dope
39:23 - all right and while that's loading what
39:25 - we can do is we can go ahead and
39:26 - actually write the rest of the code so
39:28 - heading over to app.js react requires
39:31 - that we set up something beforehand
39:33 - right and it's very simple how we use
39:34 - react through
39:35 - what we do is we essentially wrap our
39:37 - app in something called a router
39:39 - right so we need to import the required
39:40 - dependencies so at the top of the file
39:42 - i'm going to go ahead and pull this in
39:44 - so we have a bunch of dependencies that
39:46 - we put in at this point so we've got the
39:48 - router the switch and the route
39:50 - right and then what we do is everything
39:52 - inside of our app right everything
39:53 - inside of our app
39:54 - we're essentially going to go ahead and
39:57 - pop the following in so i'll explain
39:59 - exactly what we're doing here and i'll
40:00 - do it step by step so we basically first
40:03 - need to add a router
40:05 - right so we first need to add a router
40:07 - and then basically everything is going
40:08 - to go inside of that router
40:11 - so everything goes inside the rear at
40:12 - this point right then
40:14 - what we're going to do is we are going
40:17 - to
40:18 - add a switch because basically what we
40:21 - actually allows us to do is
40:22 - it allows us to render certain
40:24 - components based on
40:26 - if uh based on the route that we're in
40:28 - so at this point i'm going to add a
40:29 - switch
40:30 - here like this and then i'm going to add
40:33 - the roots
40:33 - so the roots that we're interested in
40:35 - are the following ones
40:37 - so this these two roots right so i can
40:39 - go ahead and get rid of this
40:41 - now what i've done here guys is very
40:43 - simple so i'm going to go ahead and
40:44 - assume that here we will say
40:46 - is this is the search page so let's go
40:48 - ahead and do
40:49 - this is the search
40:54 - page and i will show you exactly what
40:57 - we've done here so if you did get lost
40:58 - i'll explain what's happening
41:00 - right so let's go ahead and save this
41:03 - and we'll save this file
41:06 - nice so because this go ahead and open
41:09 - up localhost
41:12 - nope oh localhost okay okay
41:15 - whenever you see that i want to go to
41:17 - the command line
41:19 - nice so now we've got the homepage right
41:21 - but you see what we did is it says
41:23 - if your route is at the forward slash so
41:25 - if your route is at the
41:27 - home page right so we have forward slash
41:29 - which refers to the home page
41:30 - then it's going to render the home
41:32 - component right now if
41:34 - we go to forward slash search it will
41:36 - render
41:37 - this component so in this case i've just
41:39 - got h1 where it says this is a search
41:40 - page
41:41 - so cause if you want to go ahead and add
41:43 - a forward slash search to the url
41:49 - so i had a full slash search a
41:53 - a see that right and it's it's instant
41:56 - right
41:57 - yeah it's instant so super fast yeah
42:01 - super super fast and what we can do now
42:03 - is any component that sits inside here
42:06 - so we're talking root
42:08 - we're talking the home component the
42:09 - search page component we can use
42:11 - something called react router links
42:13 - inside of that component right so let's
42:15 - go ahead and go back to home
42:17 - now what do i mean by react rear links
42:19 - so let's go ahead and import
42:21 - the the correct thing that we need so we
42:23 - need the link
42:24 - from reactor or dom and this is actually
42:27 - a
42:27 - really really powerful piece of tech now
42:30 - guys so i'm going to go ahead and
42:31 - replace
42:31 - this link right here and i'm going to
42:34 - say the first link
42:35 - goes to the about page i think it was
42:38 - the about page
42:40 - like this right so we do this and then
42:43 - if i go ahead and sorry if i go ahead
42:45 - and basically what this is going to do
42:46 - is it basically replaces
42:48 - it's like an a tag so it's like a link
42:50 - right but it's just like a
42:52 - react ruler link so here if i just write
42:54 - about and then hit
42:55 - save and if we go to the let's just go
42:59 - to forward slash causes let's get rid of
43:00 - the
43:01 - search
43:05 - nice so you see there's a link now right
43:07 - and i've said it goes to the forward
43:09 - slash about
43:10 - so it needs to go to forward slash about
43:12 - so let's go ahead and click on about
43:16 - yeah there can you see the url the url
43:18 - changed yep
43:19 - it does yeah as soon as i click it boom
43:22 - it changes it
43:23 - exactly so what we can do now is we can
43:25 - go ahead and pop in
43:27 - the remaining two things we can have
43:29 - this one and this one
43:30 - and we can go ahead and have another
43:34 - link here another link here
43:36 - so i think it was about um what was the
43:39 - other links let me go ahead and pull up
43:40 - the app as well so i can see
43:41 - oops oh my alfred shot down looks like
43:46 - there you go your heart rate has shut
43:48 - down what'd you say
43:50 - my alfred oh okay i was like dude i
43:52 - really hope your heart rate is fine
43:55 - yeah let's go ahead and do the following
43:58 - so let's go ahead and check this out
44:00 - so we have about we have store
44:04 - right at the top so on the left side we
44:06 - have about and store and store goes to
44:08 - forward slash store
44:09 - this one goes to gmail here we have
44:11 - gmail
44:12 - and this one goes to images like this
44:16 - right and this one goes to images so you
44:18 - see that's it guys there's four
44:20 - four links and the reason why we're not
44:21 - using an a tag here is because if i use
44:24 - an a tag
44:25 - what's going to happen guys it's going
44:28 - to
44:28 - actually go to that page and refresh
44:31 - and we don't want that we want to use
44:34 - the link
44:35 - tag so it has no refresh and it does it
44:37 - instantly so the react way
44:39 - is to use link exactly
44:43 - exactly um oh man i don't know why
44:46 - i can't actually see the the the photos
44:50 - are so annoying you can't see the
44:52 - folders and my tv just died again so
44:54 - give me one second
44:55 - yeah i'm gonna rejoin the session guys
44:57 - so give me two seconds i'll
44:59 - rejoin that session that cause he was
45:00 - doing so
45:03 - [Music]
45:05 - oh guys i think we deserve i deserve to
45:07 - smash the
45:08 - like button for this today because this
45:10 - is a lot of techies
45:11 - a lot of tech issues like just in
45:13 - everything that has never happened
45:15 - before
45:17 - yeah like now i'm back in i'm back in
45:19 - nice
45:21 - damn holy crap guys when you're live
45:23 - this is this is trickier than it looks
45:25 - to debug this stuff so yeah nice
45:29 - awesome so we have that up and running
45:31 - um
45:32 - let's go ahead and follow me again quasi
45:35 - yep let me actually just go ahead
45:37 - and uh follow you and lift up a 55-inch
45:40 - tv and hit the on button at the same
45:42 - time
45:44 - nice so let's go ahead and do this and
45:46 - now yep
45:47 - it's nice following me so what we're
45:49 - going to do now guys is we're going to
45:50 - start this so it looks a little bit like
45:51 - what we want to get it to so the first
45:53 - step is let's go ahead
45:55 - and actually give this the appropriate
45:57 - style so we have we're inside of home
46:00 - header right that's where everything
46:01 - that we want to style is living so let's
46:03 - go ahead and do the following we say
46:04 - target home
46:05 - header give it display flex and what we
46:07 - should see at this point
46:09 - is everything inside that header should
46:11 - go in a row right because by default
46:13 - when you do flex
46:14 - uh everything goes into a row so if we
46:16 - do that
46:17 - we are importing the file we are using
46:19 - this home header
46:21 - there we go why is that not refreshing
46:24 - let's go ahead and see
46:25 - let's get rid of the this is home page
46:28 - go ahead and save this file and we've
46:31 - got oh yeah
46:32 - so right now this is actually correct so
46:34 - about
46:35 - and store uh yep we've done that
46:39 - so home header and then we're going to
46:41 - do is we're going to say justify content
46:44 - so justify content space between right
46:47 - it's going to do this
46:49 - save it and then what should happen here
46:52 - is if we refresh cozy let's go ahead and
46:56 - refresh
46:58 - is the app is the app running it is
47:00 - running right i'm on the about page
47:02 - i'm on the bob page that's fine yep
47:04 - that's all right
47:05 - so i feel like let's go ahead and double
47:08 - check
47:10 - so it seems to like that the changes
47:12 - that we're making
47:13 - aren't being home header home header
47:17 - should be i mean it's it seems fine i
47:19 - just saved it
47:21 - let me go ahead and do display flex on
47:23 - the home
47:25 - and we go ahead and do a flex direction
47:27 - column and a view of a hundred view
47:29 - height so it takes up the entire
47:30 - way hold on i'm where are you doing this
47:33 - because
47:34 - i'm following you are you on a css file
47:36 - right now
47:38 - yeah i mean home.css
47:41 - um it's showing me that you're in
47:44 - home.js yeah i can
47:47 - i can see you you can see that
47:50 - go ahead listen so now you can see me
47:53 - right in home.js
47:54 - i can see you in home.js right so
47:57 - unfollow me and follow me again
47:59 - i did many times but i'll do it again
48:02 - and let's go ahead and see if it follows
48:04 - me properly into home
48:06 - to css no yeah it does now now
48:09 - yeah you went to app.js so now i'm in
48:11 - app.js with you
48:13 - but now i'm in home.css um
48:16 - it doesn't want to go to any css files
48:18 - with you
48:21 - maybe maybe i'll just manually
48:24 - just call it out right now it's not even
48:28 - it didn't actually push the code that i
48:29 - wrote in here okay so you know what
48:32 - give me one say i'm gonna rejoin one
48:33 - more time
48:35 - it's good yeah this feels like
48:38 - somebody's just spanking me like left
48:40 - and right i know what it feels like
48:43 - it doesn't feel good at all like against
48:46 - my will
48:47 - somebody's just spanking me
48:50 - this guy can you see now
48:56 - can you see with me now if it's hyping
48:58 - hello
48:59 - cedric is like if you have any doubt
49:01 - just reboot he did that already
49:03 - let me actually try uh following you
49:06 - again try now moving around to
49:08 - different things okay so abc
49:11 - worked that's good never going to
49:14 - home.css
49:17 - no if i go into index or css
49:22 - what is okay so index.css worked
49:27 - but home.css didn't work
49:32 - app.js what the hell
49:35 - okay all right i have an idea i have a
49:37 - hunch
49:38 - pull everything out of pages yeah let's
49:41 - just pull this out of pages
49:42 - and let's go ahead all right let me let
49:44 - me test it i'll pull oh you're pulling
49:46 - it out
49:47 - yep i'll pull it out and let's get rid
49:49 - of pages
49:51 - let's get rid of components so we'll
49:53 - just do a flat hierarchy for today's
49:55 - world
49:57 - and then let's go ahead and fix our
49:59 - imports so we done
50:01 - four slash home here we have home
50:04 - there we go nice okay i think we're good
50:09 - yeah holy crap dude
50:12 - flute your code is like live sure
50:14 - completely drops when you have poor
50:15 - internet connection
50:16 - future code what happened we were
50:18 - supposed to do airbnb build
50:20 - the airbnb clone i was so excited and
50:22 - then i just stopped
50:24 - hearing from you i still want to build
50:26 - it
50:28 - um there we go finally there we go
50:32 - it's working yeah so these are the
50:34 - changes i made guys
50:35 - uh yeah so i guess it was a flat
50:36 - hierarchy i guess vs code didn't like
50:38 - that
50:39 - so yeah so now what we're going to do
50:41 - guys is i set on the home container
50:43 - itself i said display flex
50:45 - flex direction column and give it a
50:46 - height of 100 view height now what that
50:48 - did is
50:49 - if i go ahead and give this a background
50:50 - color of say red
50:52 - now you should see the entire thing goes
50:54 - red so let's go ahead and add semicolon
50:56 - nice that's what this height right here
50:58 - did and there that's it we're done
51:01 - that's it we're done that's that's
51:02 - that's good thumbs up
51:06 - that's actually how most developers show
51:08 - it you know that right like most
51:09 - developers will build something that
51:10 - looks like this and it'll be like well
51:12 - this just to give you an idea what's
51:13 - possible
51:14 - and they'll be like join my course and
51:16 - then i'll show you more
51:18 - exactly
51:22 - they get you like half in nice so we got
51:24 - that and then the home header guys so
51:26 - the header itself as well the links are
51:27 - living
51:28 - i wanted to do display flex this justify
51:31 - content if i go ahead and remove that
51:32 - you'll see it pulls all the
51:34 - header left and header right together so
51:35 - we need that to space between it
51:37 - padding means that 20 20 pixels top and
51:40 - bottom 30 pixels left and right
51:42 - right and then align them centrally so
51:44 - that they're all uh vertically aligned
51:47 - so now that we're back up to speed what
51:49 - i want to do is all of those links right
51:51 - by default they look like links which
51:53 - looks ugly right we don't want that
51:56 - so i'm going to add the following inside
51:57 - of here so i'm going to say in home
51:59 - header
52:00 - all of the links right so home header a
52:04 - tags because remember these links that
52:06 - you guys saw
52:07 - so these ones right here these actually
52:10 - convert to a tags but they're just like
52:12 - clever a tags right
52:14 - so what i'm going to do is to style it
52:16 - i'm going to say go ahead go into home
52:17 - header target the a tag
52:18 - give it a margin right 20 pixels this
52:21 - makes it actually go ahead and it fixes
52:24 - the uh
52:25 - the way that it gets rid of that
52:27 - underline by default
52:29 - and then this is the color that they use
52:31 - on google so it's a really
52:32 - strange car i tried to color picker it
52:34 - and i couldn't so i just literally
52:35 - grabbed the the source code color that
52:37 - they had
52:38 - and then the font size of 15 pixels now
52:40 - i'm gonna show you guys why i did this
52:42 - line as well so let's go ahead and save
52:43 - that
52:44 - and you can see it looks a lot cleaner
52:45 - right now cause if you hover over
52:48 - don't hover over what oh
52:52 - i'm hovering over it yeah it looks good
52:54 - yes
52:55 - and if you click it the links actually
52:57 - take you to uh to sort of new urls so if
53:00 - you go to the fourth search so
53:01 - i i see so i see the url and you guys
53:04 - should see that too yep
53:06 - yeah so that works but we want it to
53:08 - also show like an underline
53:10 - for it so what we do is because we
53:12 - removed all the styling with text
53:14 - decoration inherit now if we add this
53:18 - hover text decoration underline if you
53:20 - hover over it now
53:21 - check out what happens
53:25 - mmm nice it so we get the link
53:28 - functionality back
53:30 - and then we sort of uh man goes what
53:32 - about the data layer
53:33 - so we are using god damn
53:37 - [ __ ] jacked girlfriend girlfriend's
53:40 - getting jacked
53:47 - so now what we're going to do is we need
53:49 - to finish off the
53:50 - header right and the header right with
53:54 - the icon it seems like she's like dead
53:57 - serious too which makes it
53:59 - more hilarious and jacked
54:03 - sometimes she sends me text messages and
54:05 - they send me way off and i'm like god
54:06 - damn it
54:08 - so now i want to have like a grid right
54:10 - so i'm going to have a grid
54:12 - uh sort of icon and the grid icon that
54:14 - we're using in material ui is called
54:16 - apps icon
54:17 - so what i need to do is this one here
54:20 - apps icon
54:21 - and what we can do is we can go ahead
54:23 - and import that from material ui with
54:24 - the following line so apps icon from
54:26 - material ui icons apps
54:28 - so if i save that now you should see an
54:31 - icon pop
54:32 - in so that's how simple it is to get an
54:34 - icon in your app guys
54:36 - so it's very very clean very slick and
54:38 - then for the avatar
54:40 - basically i'm not going to go i'm
54:41 - actually going to use a blank avatar for
54:42 - now so we're going to go ahead and pop
54:44 - this in
54:45 - uh i need to go ahead and import that
54:48 - from material ui and when we say
54:49 - avatar we're talking about when you're
54:51 - logged in you know that little
54:53 - sort of circle icon rather than messing
54:55 - around with radiuses and circles and
54:57 - stuff we literally can use
54:59 - an avatar from material ui and it fixes
55:02 - all that headache for us
55:04 - uh if we save that
55:07 - um save that should what is that
55:12 - advertisement yes save that
55:16 - saved refresh guys saved it so wait why
55:20 - is that hold on hold on why is that
55:21 - thing happening because then we do
55:23 - um in settings didn't we set it up to be
55:25 - in a way where
55:27 - it auto saves let's go to auto save yeah
55:31 - yeah we did after yeah strange
55:35 - okay yeah really strange
55:39 - oh man today is just like this freaking
55:43 - strange day
55:46 - so guys we have the header right right
55:49 - now you see the header right doesn't
55:50 - look quite okay
55:52 - so i'm going to go ahead and do this so
55:53 - i'm going to target i'm going to say
55:55 - display flex
55:58 - yeah do that and you'll see it pops into
55:59 - a row so it's saved before
56:01 - there we go it pops into a row but
56:04 - everything's not
56:04 - vertically aligned right so i'm going to
56:06 - go ahead and do a line item
56:08 - centrally and watch what this one does
56:10 - so this will pull everything
56:11 - in the center on the vertical axes which
56:13 - is good then what i'm going to do is i'm
56:15 - going to say give it a minimum width of
56:17 - 13 view it because if you want to be
56:19 - responsive
56:20 - and then you see it didn't look like it
56:22 - did much but now if i say go ahead and
56:24 - space the i
56:25 - all of the children between itself if we
56:27 - do justify content space between it
56:30 - should have done
56:31 - uh it will do a good job when it goes
56:33 - bigger
56:34 - all right now what i'm going to do is
56:35 - i'm going to make sure that when we
56:36 - target any of the icons
56:38 - so this is how you target any icon
56:40 - inside so
56:41 - this is saying go inside header right
56:43 - and this is the class that material ui
56:45 - gives you by default right we can go
56:48 - ahead and do margin right of 20 pixels
56:51 - hold on hold up hold up hold up i don't
56:53 - think it's following you were you doing
56:54 - a lot of styling
56:57 - uh i think you're looking at it yeah i
56:59 - could see that one no now now it's
57:00 - following it wasn't following you for a
57:02 - little bit
57:03 - so i don't know how much styling you did
57:04 - in the last two three minutes but
57:07 - here it is i have no look at look at the
57:10 - comments
57:10 - they're saying we can't see the css
57:12 - don't see the css so they're the
57:14 - comments are coming in i caught i just i
57:16 - caught it pretty much right away
57:17 - but oh damn it okay that's cool
57:21 - i don't know how much css now here it is
57:26 - yeah this is what we're doing here guys
57:27 - so i've added header right so
57:29 - display flex align item centrally
57:31 - minimum width of 13 view it justify
57:33 - content space between
57:35 - and then to give that icon so that grid
57:37 - icon some space between that and the
57:39 - circle avatar
57:41 - i target the icon because this is the
57:42 - class name that material ui gives
57:44 - every icon and i add a margin right to
57:47 - it
57:48 - so that's why we're doing that okay uh
57:51 - awesome and then there we go we actually
57:52 - have like a
57:54 - the the top portion of the header done
57:56 - so cause if you go ahead and resize it
57:58 - now you'll see
57:59 - it's fully responsive that top uh that
58:02 - top uh header
58:03 - hey it is i'm just
58:06 - putting it through a stress test you
58:08 - know yeah
58:10 - that looks clean man i like it i like
58:12 - what you do
58:13 - bro yeah awesome uh
58:16 - oh frank says uh frank's in our inside
58:19 - of the prophet javascript course and won
58:20 - the coaching because he says the flexbox
58:22 - froggy website was great for learning
58:24 - flexbox foggy
58:25 - i was like nice yeah that that is a good
58:28 - um
58:29 - that's a really good resource by the way
58:32 - okay
58:32 - people are telling me i should put the
58:34 - title on top and i was kind of being
58:35 - lazy but i
58:37 - will do it because this is the second or
58:39 - third comment so i love
58:40 - that actually for calling me out
58:43 - let's do it so what are we working on
58:45 - right now sonny we just finished the
58:47 - header i imagine
58:49 - yeah so now we are working on adding the
58:52 - search bar functionality so we're
58:55 - actually adding the body
58:56 - of the the search page search
59:00 - bar yeah add google's box
59:03 - there we go the most english way of
59:06 - writing the title is possible
59:08 - boom sorry i exploited somebody's ear
59:10 - but it's right
59:11 - it's not nice
59:15 - so now what we're going to do guys is
59:17 - we've got the
59:18 - uh go back to home here and we've got
59:21 - inside
59:22 - the body right so inside the body i'm
59:24 - gonna add first i'm gonna add an image
59:26 - because we all love images so i'm gonna
59:28 - go ahead and add an image
59:29 - and that's gonna be the google logo so
59:31 - i've got a link here
59:33 - and this is simply the google logo okay
59:35 - so if we go ahead and save that you'll
59:36 - see
59:37 - massive google logo popped in then what
59:39 - i'm going to do
59:40 - is i'm going to target that and style it
59:43 - right so i'm going to go into home.css
59:47 - and i'm going to go and say that uh we
59:50 - should go ahead and that
59:51 - body so we're going to target the body
59:52 - we're going to target the image and say
59:54 - contain it but make it a height of 100
59:56 - pixels
59:57 - right so that will actually go ahead
60:00 - and um make it a lot more smaller and
60:03 - object fit contain keeps the aspect
60:05 - ratio so it doesn't like stretch and
60:06 - look weird
60:07 - then what we're going to do is here we
60:09 - have home body
60:10 - so like this i'm going to go ahead and
60:12 - target the home body and this is a
60:14 - neat little trick that you guys can do
60:16 - so i'm going to say the
60:17 - breath the body should take up the
60:19 - remainder of the space now the reason
60:20 - why it's going to work is because
60:22 - homebody sits inside of the home parent
60:26 - which we made flex uh and we've done the
60:28 - flex direction column
60:30 - so this is by saying flex 1 it's going
60:32 - to take up the majority of the space
60:34 - now margin top of 10 gives it a little
60:36 - bit of spacing from the top which is why
60:37 - if i remove it
60:39 - you'll see google goes up yo how'd you
60:42 - how did you center how did you center it
60:45 - so it was centered from that was
60:48 - actually from we did that
60:51 - with uh where did we do that um
60:56 - we centered that with let me go ahead
60:58 - and double check where did we do that
61:00 - yeah i was like how does this thing get
61:02 - centered so perfectly all right time for
61:04 - air horn
61:06 - [Music]
61:17 - says guys take a rest these bills are
61:20 - exhausting you guys deserve it
61:23 - i say we triple down on these guys
61:27 - we're trying to get to like seven bills
61:29 - a day
61:31 - yeah so oh this is why this is why it's
61:34 - very yeah because we're doing flex
61:36 - direction column so it spans the entire
61:38 - width
61:39 - so the direct child is is this uh home
61:42 - body so that's where you see the image
61:44 - tag
61:45 - hold on hold on so what's making it
61:46 - centered
61:48 - are you giving me like a politician
61:50 - roundabout answer or
61:52 - okay yeah you see that yeah
61:56 - so flex if i added flex direction column
61:59 - by default it's going to take up the
62:01 - entire
62:02 - row in that column right oh that is
62:06 - weird dude i would never think about
62:08 - that that like flex
62:09 - column like flex direction column would
62:12 - be used as centered
62:14 - yeah so like now if i add like a h2 or
62:16 - h1 tag or something oh why is my emit
62:18 - not working
62:19 - i say test you'll see now
62:22 - let's go ahead and do test so test so
62:25 - image won't but like if i take
62:26 - if i go ahead and pop another image in
62:28 - right you'll see
62:29 - that the image will sit and it should
62:32 - sit in the middle there we go got it
62:34 - okay got it um it would be doing it
62:38 - would actually be using the width
62:40 - but you would do text align center to
62:41 - get it centered yep
62:44 - yep oh i see what you're saying i see
62:46 - what you're saying okay it's still using
62:47 - the width with the text it's taking up
62:49 - the whole width but it's left aligned by
62:50 - default so even if the text is like
62:53 - boom this big the text is just taking up
62:56 - all the space to the left but with an
62:58 - image you're saying
63:00 - it will actually put the image in the
63:02 - middle
63:04 - exactly yeah but you see if i do a
63:06 - center tag
63:07 - it actually uses that and then i sent a
63:09 - tag and then h1 h1 yeah send today or
63:12 - that's how i center stuff dude that's
63:14 - how that's
63:18 - i was going to say because yes this uh
63:20 - double check if you go into um
63:23 - vs code settings quickly just double
63:25 - check that the prettier's on
63:27 - all right yeah that'll make developing a
63:30 - lot quicker so let's go ahead and do
63:32 - uh do s format on save so type in format
63:35 - on save
63:36 - all right so let's go all right format
63:40 - right there one save yep i got it
63:44 - okay and then you see it at the top it
63:46 - says uh go to so it says no
63:48 - right so click that and you want to
63:50 - click on oh my god
63:52 - which one is it default
63:56 - oh my mine's nose oh interesting
63:58 - prettier this one right here right
64:01 - i want to say yeah but i don't trust it
64:04 - so maybe
64:05 - i mean that looks right let's try it
64:07 - that's right
64:08 - let's try it yeah let's give it a shot
64:13 - um i don't really know i mean it didn't
64:15 - i don't know what it did bro but it
64:16 - seems like it's good
64:18 - yeah that's fine cool
64:22 - so there we go so then we have the
64:25 - image tag there and then what we're
64:27 - going to do is we have
64:28 - the i'm going to basically add a an
64:31 - input container here right
64:32 - so it's going to be input container and
64:34 - this one we're going to basically put a
64:36 - placeholder here
64:38 - for the search and the reason why so
64:40 - this is going to be like a search
64:42 - all i want to do is have a one search
64:44 - component and once that's built
64:46 - that will sit there and that will have
64:48 - the buttons it will have everything we
64:49 - need
64:50 - in that one search component the reason
64:52 - why i want it to be a component is that
64:53 - we can reuse that component then on the
64:56 - page
64:56 - the results page right so that will help
64:59 - us use
64:59 - have some reusability there so with that
65:02 - said what i'm going to do is go over to
65:05 - create a search search component so i'm
65:08 - going to create a file called search.js
65:10 - so search.js and we should pop in
65:13 - now um yep
65:16 - and i'm do rfce and my snippets aren't
65:20 - working so you're going to oh there it
65:21 - is there we go
65:22 - nice and then i can do class name search
65:26 - i'm gonna set up my css file so i'm
65:29 - gonna say import
65:31 - search dot css nice i'm gonna go ahead
65:34 - and create the search.css
65:36 - file so search.css boom
65:39 - and we should be inside there now all
65:41 - right awesome
65:42 - so we've got our search file set up and
65:44 - then what we're going to do now
65:46 - is we are going to
65:50 - go ahead and actually lay this one out
65:52 - so
65:53 - the search field right so the first
65:55 - thing we have in the search field is the
65:56 - input field
65:58 - so i'm going to go ahead and create
66:00 - create a container for that
66:02 - some say class name equals search this
66:05 - one's gonna be called
66:06 - input right and inside of here i'm gonna
66:08 - have three things i'm gonna have the
66:10 - search icon
66:11 - uh so i'm gonna have a search icon which
66:13 - is gonna be the hourglass
66:15 - so this one i'm gonna give that a class
66:16 - name of search input icon
66:18 - i'm going to have an input right so i'm
66:21 - going to actually have an input
66:25 - like this and that's going to be
66:27 - basically be where you type in some
66:29 - information
66:30 - and then you want to google something
66:31 - and then i'm going to have a mic icon
66:33 - right so i'm going to have three things
66:34 - inside of here and i'm going to import
66:36 - those at the top so we have access to
66:38 - them
66:39 - so let's go ahead and import them save
66:41 - the file
66:42 - go back to home and let's import it here
66:44 - so we can actually see our search
66:47 - working so let's go ahead and say import
66:50 - search from
66:51 - [Music]
66:53 - search like this right now we should see
66:57 - some kind of input and some icons pop on
66:59 - the screen in a second
67:01 - so let's go ahead and see it says import
67:04 - function home
67:05 - there we go you can see you got that
67:07 - little it's very ugly at the moment but
67:08 - you can see that it's there
67:10 - right so we've got the search input and
67:14 - the rest of the stuff so what i'm going
67:15 - to do is style that now so it doesn't
67:17 - look as ugly as we can see it there
67:19 - and the way we do that is i'm going to
67:21 - go inside of my
67:23 - search.css and i'm basically going to go
67:25 - ahead and type the following so i'm
67:26 - going to say
67:28 - search input to go ahead and target that
67:33 - and then i'm going to say display flex
67:37 - align item center right so let's go
67:39 - ahead and see that and i love doing this
67:40 - as we do it like this because then
67:42 - you'll see
67:43 - as things sort of get started the
67:44 - difference that it's going to make
67:46 - so if i go ahead and add a border around
67:48 - this of light gray so i'm going to go
67:50 - ahead and do border one pixel solid
67:52 - light gray
67:53 - and you can see it adds a border around
67:54 - it i'm going to set the height of this
67:56 - to be 30 pixels
67:59 - right so it should get a little taller
68:01 - i'm going to give it some padding
68:02 - and i bought a radius of 999 pixels
68:06 - right and the reason why i do 999 is i
68:07 - want that perfect curvature right so i
68:10 - added some padding i've done 10 pixels
68:12 - top and bottom
68:13 - 20 pixels left and right i'm going to do
68:15 - the width
68:16 - is going to be dynamic so it's going to
68:17 - say 75
68:19 - view width which means so you always use
68:21 - 75 in the screen width
68:23 - then i'm going to do margin 0 auto and
68:25 - this is a trick
68:26 - to make it horizontally centered okay so
68:30 - if i do this
68:30 - you should now see a centers
68:32 - horizontally then i'm going to do margin
68:34 - top 40 pixels
68:36 - and that will push it away from the
68:37 - google uh icon
68:39 - and then i'm going to do a max width of
68:41 - 560 pixels so that way it never grows
68:43 - past a certain high uh width so even if
68:45 - you're on a huge screen
68:46 - it's not gonna like basically take up
68:48 - like if you're on a 4k monitor which is
68:49 - like 50 inches
68:51 - you know you don't want that search bar
68:52 - to be huge so you give it a max width
68:55 - all right so very very clean uh look and
68:57 - feel there
68:58 - then what we're going to do is we're
68:59 - going to target the inner input field
69:01 - right that inner input fold and what i
69:04 - can do is i can say flex
69:05 - one because i want that input field to
69:07 - take up the majority of the space inside
69:09 - of it so you see it expand
69:10 - right then what i can do is i can say
69:12 - give it some padding so i want to do the
69:14 - same thing
69:14 - 10 pixels up and bottom top and bottom
69:17 - 20 pixels left and right
69:18 - i want to say make it a font size of
69:21 - medium so
69:22 - medium by default is one that they
69:23 - provide and it'll make the text that we
69:25 - type a little bigger
69:26 - i'm going to say give it a border of
69:27 - none so now you can see the input field
69:29 - has a little border around it
69:31 - but as soon as i add this line watch how
69:32 - everything snaps together so if i go
69:34 - ahead and pop this in
69:36 - there we go look at that you see how
69:37 - that like one simple change
69:39 - and now it's looking very clean right
69:41 - now kazi if you want to click on the
69:43 - input field
69:46 - right now why the hell do we see that
69:48 - blue ugly nastiness right you see that
69:51 - like outline
69:53 - yeah we don't want that and you don't
69:55 - see that in google
69:56 - so what we can do is if we target the
69:58 - input field
70:00 - and we say go to the input field and say
70:03 - colon focus so when you're
70:04 - focusing on the input so when you click
70:06 - it if we set a property
70:08 - called outline width to zero
70:13 - oh look at that that is nice
70:16 - that's cool right you do outline with
70:18 - two one
70:20 - uh let's do like one pixel uh-huh
70:23 - oh do it to 20 pixels yeah i wonder what
70:27 - happens if we do that
70:28 - is that hold on i don't know maybe it
70:31 - just has like it's either on or off
70:33 - you know yeah i think it's like a it's
70:35 - like a boolean i guess maybe yeah it's a
70:37 - boolean
70:38 - okay cool yeah zero is what we want
70:40 - right now it looks clean
70:42 - yeah so that's really nice right so that
70:45 - it's already looking super crisp
70:47 - like google right now we gave the search
70:50 - icon
70:50 - a um a color
70:54 - a class name of search input icon so i'm
70:55 - going to go ahead and target that
70:57 - because i want to make that color gray
70:59 - right so i'm just using default colors
71:01 - here
71:01 - they're kind of close to google's ones
71:03 - and it makes your life a little easier
71:04 - when you're making this
71:05 - so color gray there we go and then what
71:08 - we are going to do
71:09 - is we are actually going to go ahead and
71:11 - add some buttons okay
71:13 - so we're going to add some advanced
71:15 - underneath it because
71:16 - as you guys can see like it was very
71:18 - quick to sort of get to this point
71:20 - but like it's just all these little
71:21 - tricks and hacks and stuff like that
71:23 - that you sort of pick up along the way
71:24 - it's very important to get
71:25 - good at those so that way you can build
71:27 - at that speed as well that's why the
71:29 - greatest ever even he says
71:31 - the damn this outline width thing will
71:32 - be very helpful
71:35 - yeah really handy and honestly in some
71:37 - other builds
71:38 - i wish i did put in there because it is
71:39 - a really nice finishing touch
71:41 - to us especially to a search bar when
71:43 - you're making um
71:45 - when you have like an icon on the side
71:46 - and things like that
71:48 - so what we're going to do now is we're
71:50 - going to actually create a
71:52 - so underneath this div i'm gonna have
71:55 - a div called search buttons right
71:58 - and these buttons are gonna be primarily
72:01 - responsible for the two things that you
72:02 - see on google it says
72:03 - google search and it says i'm feeling
72:05 - lucky so let's go ahead and check all
72:07 - one that we built quasi
72:09 - all right let's go to it
72:17 - you want to go to the home page uh no so
72:19 - the one that we deployed
72:21 - oh i see okay yeah right over here yep
72:24 - so you see these two buttons google
72:25 - search and i'm feeling lucky
72:27 - right we need to get those working so
72:29 - i'm going to show you guys
72:30 - are we done with the search bar no yeah
72:33 - so this is all part of the search bar
72:36 - got it okay cool yeah this is all part
72:37 - of the search bar so we're almost we are
72:40 - we'll be done pretty quick
72:41 - um so now what we're going to do is
72:43 - we're going to add a button and the way
72:44 - we can do it
72:45 - and thank you deepak for that uh nice
72:47 - little donation and thank you come on
72:49 - nice because thank you for an amazing
72:50 - tutorial small contribution from my side
72:53 - massively appreciate that dude thank you
72:55 - debunk and thank you yeah that is
72:57 - amazing oh two donations like right at
72:59 - the same time that is
73:00 - odd unless they were friends and
73:02 - coordinated it together
73:05 - nice so what we're going to do now is
73:08 - add a button but we're adding it with a
73:10 - capital b
73:11 - because it's from material ui so i need
73:13 - to go ahead and import that from
73:14 - material ui so
73:16 - let's go ahead and pop that in and this
73:18 - button is going to say google search
73:19 - google search and i'm going to have
73:22 - another button
73:23 - which is going to say i'm feeling lucky
73:25 - right and you see i added a variant
73:27 - outline to this one
73:28 - so this is a google property so let's go
73:30 - ahead and open localhost
73:33 - all right so you see the second one had
73:37 - varian outlined and the first one didn't
73:39 - so this goes to show you
73:40 - that google actually can go ahead and
73:42 - provide you the material ui library
73:44 - design that we provide you with
73:46 - different props one of them is variant
73:48 - so in this case if we add variant
73:50 - outlined
73:50 - you can see that we get this by default
73:52 - which looks pretty clean
73:54 - yeah so we can go ahead and add that now
73:57 - what we're going to do
73:58 - is somebody says i suggest you use sas
74:01 - preprocessor for css
74:03 - guys that's why we use bam so trust me i
74:05 - used to use sas but bem's a lot cleaner
74:07 - when you get used to using it and it's a
74:09 - lot faster
74:10 - um yep so now what we're gonna do is we
74:13 - are going to add
74:15 - um okay
74:18 - so i actually i actually want to make
74:21 - the entire
74:22 - search field actually we'll do that
74:25 - afterwards with it afterwards so what
74:26 - these two buttons here google search
74:28 - and i'm feeling lucky let's go ahead and
74:30 - style these so they look
74:31 - like we want them to look right so let's
74:33 - go ahead and firstly let's go and
74:34 - style the search buttons container so
74:36 - i'm going to hop over to the css
74:38 - and say go ahead and pop in a margin top
74:41 - of 30
74:42 - pixels display flat nice justify content
74:45 - so justify content center was important
74:47 - here
74:47 - if i don't have that it's left aligned
74:50 - so it's flex start by default
74:52 - and we want to center it right and then
74:55 - what we do is
74:56 - we target the button and this is how we
74:58 - do that
74:59 - is we say inside the search bar
75:00 - container target and normal button
75:02 - because that's what gets rendered our
75:03 - material ui's button
75:05 - i'm going to say give it a margin of 5
75:07 - pixels a padding of 7 pixels
75:09 - top and bottom 15 pixels left and right
75:12 - let's go ahead and add that
75:13 - you can see it automatically spaces it
75:14 - apart give it a background color
75:18 - of a light gray and give it a white pic
75:20 - uh
75:21 - one pixel solid border so let's go ahead
75:23 - and do that
75:24 - and there you go like we started to look
75:26 - a lot more and you see by default
75:28 - material ui
75:30 - actually goes ahead and makes everything
75:32 - like capital letters which isn't very
75:33 - nice that we don't want to do that in
75:35 - our case
75:35 - so what we can do is we can override
75:37 - that by saying um
75:39 - uh checks transform inherit so if i go
75:42 - ahead and do that
75:43 - you'll see it drops down to the lower
75:45 - size right
75:46 - to finish it off i'm going to say color
75:48 - is this nice little gray
75:50 - and there we go we get a very nice sort
75:51 - of finishing touch right
75:54 - now uh please don't spam the chat guys
75:57 - you're just gonna get blocked so yeah
76:01 - yeah yeah so now um
76:04 - let's go ahead
76:09 - so now if you go ahead and hover over
76:11 - that button
76:13 - it's fun for me to block i just sit
76:14 - there and a lot of my work is blocking
76:16 - no i'm kidding
76:18 - yeah okay click here yeah so if you
76:21 - hover over the uh the buttons google
76:23 - search and i'm feeling lucky
76:24 - uh-huh and look at how nice it looks
76:26 - when i click it dude look at that so the
76:28 - click looks really nice but the hover
76:30 - doesn't it doesn't look like google's
76:32 - yet right
76:33 - yeah so wait what does google server
76:35 - look like let's see
76:36 - so let's look at the deployed oh yeah we
76:38 - can use this one yeah so you see that it
76:40 - gets like a
76:41 - nice hovered look right yeah but i like
76:44 - how even theirs is not responsive and
76:46 - ours is more responsive than actual
76:48 - google right yeah this is something i
76:50 - found yeah i was like i couldn't believe
76:51 - that it wasn't responsive when i saw it
76:54 - that's embarrassing dude that's actually
76:56 - embarrassing
76:57 - yeah like then they should literally
76:59 - like with a few lines of code look how
77:01 - much better that looks like yeah and i'm
77:04 - like
77:04 - zoomed in wow yeah
77:08 - so guys this shows you like even
77:10 - companies like google sometimes they
77:11 - don't
77:12 - get the responsiveness right you know um
77:16 - nice so what we're going to do now is
77:18 - actually add a hover functionality for
77:20 - the buttons
77:21 - so we target the same thing at the top
77:23 - so we say to go ahead target the buttons
77:25 - but the hover state
77:27 - and i'm going to add a box shadow so i'm
77:29 - going to add a little box shadow here
77:31 - so because if you just want to hover
77:32 - your mouse over it
77:34 - and then we can see it as as we uh as it
77:37 - changes yes
77:40 - yeah so just keep it hovered up there we
77:42 - go and then what we'll say is i'll say a
77:44 - background
77:45 - color wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
77:48 - wait wait
77:49 - anytime your screen is not showing like
77:51 - i'm gonna give it a shout
77:53 - cool yeah go for it so a background
77:56 - color
77:57 - of gray so now if you hover over it
78:00 - yep yes you see it's slightly changed
78:03 - right it's very hard to tell but it's
78:04 - like i can do it and
78:06 - comment it out and put it back uh
78:09 - i'll do these three and then and then
78:11 - you so
78:12 - these these three together are the ones
78:14 - that will be much more apparent to show
78:16 - so if i do that you see that yeah i can
78:18 - see it yep
78:19 - yeah because in that that way you can
78:20 - see a lot clearer when we do that so
78:22 - now um when we sort of hover over it you
78:26 - get that very very nice look and feel
78:28 - now there is a little other line that
78:30 - they added on the google button so this
78:32 - actually came directly from google
78:34 - button
78:34 - and it says add a linear gradient from
78:37 - the top to the bottom
78:38 - and it's basically a gray it's like a
78:40 - white color and it's very subtle
78:42 - like it's so so uncommented
78:46 - i mean comment it
78:50 - so you can see here here it's just like
78:52 - a gray
78:53 - but here if you do this it's actually oh
78:56 - nice it like
78:58 - yeah looks like more solid
79:01 - yeah you see that that's a flat button
79:03 - and then this has some kind of like
79:05 - shine to it looks like a little 3d
79:07 - button yeah it's so
79:09 - it's just it's really subtle but i can
79:11 - experience the difference
79:13 - yeah insane like small small tweaks like
79:15 - that are going to make a difference
79:17 - um yeah so we've got that in place
79:20 - now what i'm going to do is i'm going to
79:22 - say when you click this button so on
79:24 - click
79:26 - i'm going to say fire off the search
79:28 - function so fire off the search function
79:30 - and we need to obviously write the
79:32 - search function so con
79:33 - search equals it takes an event whenever
79:35 - we have an on click
79:36 - and we're gonna do e dot prevent default
79:38 - and what this will do guys
79:40 - is when you click that button we don't
79:41 - want it to refresh or do anything funky
79:44 - um so i'm gonna add that by default and
79:47 - some of you guys might be wondering that
79:48 - only happens in a form
79:49 - we are going to be making it form very
79:51 - soon so that's why
79:53 - i'm going to add that now um so
79:56 - now when whenever kazi types inside the
79:58 - the search bar so inside that middle bar
80:01 - we don't capture or save the input
80:04 - the input text right we need to keep
80:06 - track of it so in order to keep track of
80:08 - the input text
80:10 - we're going to basically use something
80:11 - called state and state essentially
80:13 - is how you write a variable inside of
80:15 - react so here i can say const this is
80:18 - the syntax for writing a piece of state
80:19 - and this is a functional component
80:21 - so we're using the use state hook so we
80:23 - say input
80:24 - set input and this is how we modify that
80:26 - value and we just got another donation
80:28 - thank you
80:30 - whoa nice thank you oh
80:34 - we just got 20 donation dude wait what
80:37 - where hold
80:38 - on wait for it to load bro you're too
80:39 - fast on your phone
80:41 - holy crap whoa
80:52 - thank you so much damn freaking 20
80:55 - donation and he goes thanks for the
80:58 - valuable content you
81:00 - got it we're gonna keep banging this
81:01 - content out so
81:03 - thank you for the love really appreciate
81:05 - you yeah
81:06 - that's huge dude thank you so much yeah
81:09 - so now we're gonna do um we have the
81:12 - search
81:13 - would you educate oh yeah we were saying
81:15 - up the state so input set input
81:17 - and then we say use state right and then
81:19 - by default
81:20 - we want that to be a blank string
81:22 - because you have nothing in the input
81:23 - field
81:24 - when you start off we need to import
81:26 - this so we can go ahead and do this
81:28 - so import oh yeah i'm gonna do the
81:32 - air horn because that's a good donation
81:34 - you guys and it's a little delayed but
81:36 - here it is
81:43 - that's where i got it from bro yeah
81:47 - yeah nice um there we go so now
81:51 - now what we're going to do is we have
81:54 - we are going to change the are we going
81:57 - to map that input to the input field
81:59 - right so we go to do that we say input
82:02 - value
82:03 - equals input and what this does is it
82:06 - maps the input
82:07 - here right so we're saying this input
82:09 - and state is always going to be mapped
82:11 - to this input but right now it's always
82:12 - going to be mapped to your blank string
82:14 - but we want to basically keep track of
82:15 - it as kazi types in so in order to do
82:17 - that
82:18 - we say on change so on change equals
82:21 - unchanged fires off an event right so
82:23 - we're gonna it fires off an event but we
82:25 - can just shorthand this and say e
82:28 - and then what we can say is this is an
82:29 - arrow function so we can say set the
82:31 - input text to be whatever cause you
82:34 - typed in which is e.target.value that's
82:36 - how we get that value
82:38 - right now what this means is if we've
82:41 - done it correctly if kazi types now it
82:43 - will just type normally
82:44 - but behind the scenes it's actually been
82:46 - captured in the state so kazi go ahead
82:48 - and type in the
82:49 - the input field nice
82:52 - can i okay cool so that's all good that
82:55 - means that we are
82:56 - we've connected it correctly if you guys
82:58 - get to this point
82:59 - and then you don't uh actually see
83:03 - the field being updated then you haven't
83:05 - done the unchanged correctly right so be
83:07 - sure to do that correctly
83:08 - now what when we click that google
83:11 - search button
83:12 - how do i connect the google search
83:15 - button
83:15 - so that whenever kazi types in and hits
83:17 - the enter key
83:19 - like it detects it and then something
83:21 - actually triggers by the way real
83:22 - real quick amanda's just joined and he
83:24 - goes wait what
83:26 - i just joined in after an interview is
83:28 - that really google or is it a clone
83:31 - nice he just joined after an interview
83:33 - dude he's 17.
83:35 - he's crushing it holy crap he's in pwj
83:38 - he's 17 and he's just he's yeah he's got
83:41 - a lot of talent
83:42 - like i'm really pumped to have him on
83:44 - our team dude
83:46 - yeah he's insane nice another donation
83:50 - thank you so much sayantan he says you
83:52 - guys are amazing dude your work inspires
83:54 - me a lot thank you for these live
83:55 - streams i made some of the projects by
83:57 - watching these live streams let's get it
83:59 - nice awesome
84:03 - all right so this is looking good i'm
84:05 - liking this now
84:06 - so input is the variable where
84:09 - everything i'm typing into this
84:11 - blah blah blah like whatever i'm typing
84:13 - in here right that's going
84:14 - straight into input yeah okay
84:17 - and then you can use that and you're
84:19 - probably using that right over here
84:21 - in the form we just got another twenty
84:25 - dollar donation
84:26 - what from dj spouse
84:34 - you guys are dope keep up the great work
84:37 - thank you
84:37 - so much bro thank you dude that's insane
84:41 - love that damn we're at eighty dollars
84:44 - we're about to break a hundred soon this
84:46 - is huge this is gonna be our like what
84:48 - eighth live stream if we did that yeah
84:50 - that's
84:50 - crazy so guys i'm gonna get back into
84:54 - the explanation i know i keep getting
84:55 - distracted by donations but i can't help
84:57 - it i
84:58 - always will appreciate it until i'm in
85:00 - the ground
85:01 - so um let's go here so for example
85:05 - so this is the input whatever i type
85:07 - gets stored in here
85:09 - and then it's also being stored in here
85:11 - giving giving it to
85:12 - as a value and then you're using set
85:15 - input to give it
85:16 - the actual value right to store an input
85:19 - you're pulling the value out of whatever
85:21 - i type in the
85:23 - form or the search bar and then you're
85:25 - making sure
85:26 - that when that search functionality runs
85:30 - you are um you're making sure that it's
85:33 - actually
85:33 - preventing the refresh yeah
85:37 - we're using this function we're using
85:39 - the search function
85:40 - uh so this is actually connected to when
85:43 - we click the google search button
85:45 - oh right here my bad okay i missed that
85:47 - what i'm trying to do now is i'm going
85:48 - to show you guys a really neat trick
85:51 - right now this trick is basically how
85:54 - to um how to make it so that when you
85:57 - hit the
85:57 - enter key when you're typing in the
86:00 - input field
86:00 - when you hit the enter key they will
86:02 - actually trigger this google search
86:03 - button
86:04 - right so how do we do that with very
86:05 - minimal lines of code and i'll show you
86:07 - and it's very impressive when we
86:08 - actually do this
86:09 - so to prove that this isn't working i'm
86:11 - going to do a console log
86:13 - and i'm going to say you hit
86:16 - search you hit the search button right
86:19 - so i'm going to do this so now because
86:21 - if you go ahead and open the terminal
86:23 - uh open the terminal sorry the inspector
86:27 - let me go ahead and open the inspector
86:30 - so i will go here inspect
86:34 - and uh console yep and this refresh
86:42 - and then let's type in all right so i'm
86:44 - gonna go ahead and do that so let's get
86:46 - out of here
86:53 - yeah and if you hit the enter key
86:57 - yeah i just did yeah nothing happened
87:00 - right
87:00 - nothing happened and i can prove it to
87:03 - you guys by
87:05 - showing the keyboard yep okay
87:08 - if you click the google search button
87:11 - this one here it actually says you
87:14 - search the button
87:15 - right so what we're going to do now is
87:17 - map it so that we can so that when kazi
87:19 - hits the enter key
87:20 - and i'm going to show you it will
87:21 - actually submit that that function so to
87:23 - do that in
87:24 - super super easy way let's go ahead and
87:26 - change this
87:27 - div to a form right which means you have
87:30 - to close the closing
87:31 - make the closing tag of form as well and
87:33 - then all we have to do guys
87:35 - is make the button type the submit and
87:38 - literally with that said whoa
87:42 - my god what's happening you oh god
87:51 - oh my god that's insane
87:55 - whoa okay let's go
87:58 - back on the screen
88:01 - uh frank says guys i just landed a
88:04 - six-figure consulting project
88:06 - for sonos that's
88:10 - insane holy crap
88:16 - [Music]
88:25 - that's crazy dude holy crap
88:29 - holy [ __ ] all right
88:32 - based on the spotify clown okay he goes

88:40 - radio station prod wait what am i doing
88:43 - hold on people can't see the thing my
88:46 - bad
88:46 - so to make their new react and react
88:49 - native
88:50 - radio station product they hired me
88:53 - based on the spotify clone i built using
88:55 - sonny's live
88:57 - video on youtube bro
89:00 - that's insane holy crap
89:03 - oh my god bro bigger concerning project
89:08 - damn dude i'm so incredibly grateful for
89:11 - clever programmer team yo
89:13 - let's get this bread bro
89:16 - insane and guys just a reminder frank
89:19 - was i was speaking to frank on tuesday
89:21 - in a coaching call so right after we
89:23 - finished the whatsapp build
89:25 - i jumped straight on a coaching call and
89:26 - frank was in there talking with him so
89:28 - that's insane that's so so cool yo sonny
89:31 - let's get on

90:30 - i know saying that
90:37 - yeah that's like a six-figure job a
90:39 - six-figure con and with sonos sonos is
90:41 - such a big company like
90:43 - oh my god hey dude you know what we
90:46 - should do
90:46 - we should have a counter at the top how
90:48 - many people have landed
90:50 - how many people has clever programmer
90:53 - helped land
90:54 - jobs we should have a counter at the top
90:56 - i want to get to 5 000 this year
90:58 - 5 000 and then next year i want us to
91:01 - get to 10 000 people getting jobs
91:03 - yeah because honestly the amount of
91:05 - people especially in that coaching
91:06 - course or in live streams that say they
91:08 - landed a job like 100
91:09 - we should keep track of that that'd be
91:11 - awesome yeah
91:12 - i think that would be amazing if we did
91:15 - that i'm pumped
91:16 - yeah i definitely want to add a lot of
91:18 - those things in here
91:20 - super super legit and let's get back
91:23 - into the
91:24 - training nice this is crazy right so
91:27 - we changed the outer div into a form
91:30 - right so a form and the class name was
91:32 - search
91:33 - and what we're going to do now is
91:36 - we change the button type the one that
91:38 - we want to trigger
91:39 - when we have the enter key here we
91:41 - change that type to submit
91:42 - so now cause if you type if you i think
91:45 - you might need to refresh but if you
91:46 - type and what i'm gonna do is also i'm
91:47 - gonna say you hit the search button
91:48 - and i'm also gonna show what the input
91:50 - was at that point so
91:52 - let's go ahead and do this one sec one
91:54 - sec let me go ahead and save this
91:56 - uh there we go now if you refresh
92:00 - all right i'm gonna refresh
92:03 - okay so now if you type in and then you
92:06 - hit the enter key
92:07 - so type in some some stuff
92:11 - i see it oh it says you hit the search
92:13 - button and it pulled out what i said
92:15 - which is elon musk
92:16 - dude yeah we were yeah we were looking
92:18 - at your code right i just want to make
92:19 - sure we're following you properly
92:21 - okay yeah yeah so we changed the to get
92:24 - that working guys all we did was change
92:26 - the outer
92:27 - div to a form and change and change the
92:29 - button that we want to trigger on the
92:30 - enter key to
92:31 - type submit that's insane like uh if a
92:34 - lot of people end up doing this hacky
92:35 - way of listening to when the
92:37 - key is pressed don't do any of that just
92:39 - do this simple trick
92:40 - and that will save you uh so much what's
92:42 - the trick
92:43 - type submit so you change the div
92:46 - that you're in to a form so the entire
92:49 - all the children are part of the form
92:50 - and then you change the button type of
92:52 - the thing that you want to sort of
92:53 - submit
92:54 - so if we click that button it will
92:56 - launch uh the search function right
92:58 - but if you make the button type submit
93:00 - it also means when you're in any input
93:02 - field inside
93:04 - of that form and you hit the enter key
93:06 - it will submit this button which means
93:08 - it basically triggers the young click
93:10 - got it now why um i don't want to go too
93:14 - much down a rabbit hole but why do we
93:15 - have to make
93:16 - the entire thing oh because this whole
93:18 - thing is a form you want this entire
93:20 - input to act like a form
93:22 - yeah i want the entire that's okay okay
93:24 - got it got it yep
93:26 - so so even the yeah so you know the our
93:28 - input field is actually kind of a
93:30 - custom input field at this point so yeah
93:33 - so that's how you do it which is pretty
93:34 - cool nice
93:36 - so at that point guys what we're going
93:38 - to do is i'm basically going to say
93:40 - do something with the input right so
93:42 - we're going to come back to this point
93:43 - so i'm going to say come back
93:45 - and fix basically at this point right
93:47 - and then what we're going to do is
93:49 - here i'm going to say uh
93:52 - so so we're actually going to use react
93:54 - viewer gives us something called history
93:55 - right
93:56 - so in order to get the history i'm going
93:58 - to explain what this is but we pretty
93:59 - much need to import
94:00 - the history uh and i'll explain all of
94:03 - this in a sec so
94:04 - import use history this is a hook and
94:06 - this provides us with the browser's
94:08 - history right so what it does is it what
94:11 - we can say at this point is when you hit
94:12 - the search button
94:13 - let's go ahead and take you so we're
94:15 - saying push
94:17 - this page into your history so it's
94:19 - essentially redirecting you
94:21 - right so so push this page and then
94:23 - we're pushing you to the search page
94:26 - right so we're pushing into the search
94:27 - page now remember app.js we said if you
94:30 - go to the search page
94:31 - it renders this out right which means
94:33 - that now cause if you refresh
94:36 - all right let's go ahead and refresh
94:39 - here
94:40 - yep refresh and you type in something
94:45 - into that search bar
94:46 - why isn't it showing up okay there we go
94:48 - yep yeah
94:49 - so type something in and then you hit
94:50 - the enter key
94:56 - oh nice okay so now it's actually
94:59 - routing me to the search page and this
95:00 - is where you're gonna build
95:02 - the actual search page that's gonna have
95:04 - all the results i imagine
95:07 - exactly result one result two result
95:10 - three
95:11 - the little like bar at the top
95:14 - yep exactly but let's go back now so
95:17 - let's go back to
95:18 - forward slash so i'm going to make this
95:21 - component reusable now
95:23 - so i'm going to make a i'm going to
95:24 - slightly modify this component so that
95:26 - we can use it in other places right so
95:30 - in the next page on the results page we
95:31 - don't we want the we want that search
95:33 - bar but we don't want
95:35 - the buttons we don't want the google
95:36 - search and i'm feeling lucky button so
95:38 - what i can do is inside of search
95:42 - i can basically go ahead and this is
95:43 - where we pass in something called props
95:45 - right so i can actually pass a prop in
95:48 - called hide buttons
95:49 - right high buttons and by default
95:53 - that value is false so if we don't pass
95:55 - anything in i'm going to just assume
95:57 - it's false
95:57 - right and then what i can say is
96:01 - i can say right this is where the
96:03 - buttons are getting rendered
96:05 - so i can say if we don't pass the option
96:08 - to hide the buttons
96:10 - then i will render out this this is
96:11 - called a ternary yeah let's go tenory
96:13 - opera
96:14 - so you can go then i can go ahead and do
96:16 - this right so then i can show the
96:18 - buttons
96:19 - otherwise i can go ahead and show the
96:22 - same
96:23 - thing where i can show the same thing
96:24 - but i want to hide the buttons right
96:27 - so here very important thing now
96:31 - the buttons here we have in order to get
96:34 - the uh the enter functionality you still
96:36 - need to render the button
96:38 - but you just have to hide it in a very
96:39 - clever way okay
96:41 - so the way we do that now is i will show
96:43 - you so
96:45 - the way we do that is we pretty much go
96:46 - ahead and do search buttons
96:48 - hidden like this uh sorry we just do a
96:52 - button type i can go ahead and give the
96:55 - um
96:57 - a class name to this button so i can go
97:00 - ahead and give these buttons a class
97:01 - name
97:02 - i can say class name buttons hidden and
97:05 - then what i'm going to do is
97:06 - to hide it but keep its functionality
97:10 - i can go ahead and do this
97:13 - i can say search buttons hidden i can
97:15 - say display
97:17 - none important
97:20 - like this right and what this will do
97:24 - is you see now if i go ahead and where
97:28 - we render that
97:29 - if i go ahead and do the following if i
97:31 - say hide buttons
97:33 - you'll see on the right hand side the
97:35 - button should disappear
97:38 - so kazi check this one out yep this is
97:40 - quite a cool sort of reusability tray so
97:42 - now
97:43 - you see what we did is uh if we go
97:45 - inside so you see at the bottom it says
97:46 - hide buttons
97:48 - yep right i'm passing this prop in so if
97:50 - i if i don't hide the buttons
97:52 - then and i save it down this
97:56 - yeah and then if i hide the buttons
97:59 - oh nice so you can okay that's sick so
98:02 - you can use that search bar
98:04 - in the search that bar that you created
98:06 - you can use it in the search page
98:08 - and remove the google search and i'm
98:10 - feeling lucky buttons and then just be
98:12 - good to go
98:13 - exactly but if we refresh here you'll
98:16 - see that
98:17 - it actually does work right so it
98:19 - actually works
98:20 - and even if you type something in the
98:21 - hit the enter key so let's go ahead and
98:23 - type something in and hit enter key
98:27 - you see it still worked wow yeah even
98:30 - without the buttons present because the
98:32 - buttons are actually there
98:34 - on the dom so they're actually there on
98:35 - the web page yeah we're choosing to
98:37 - display none so we're actually hiding
98:40 - them
98:41 - right wow so that's a really cool
98:43 - important point and we do
98:44 - yeah that's pretty clean like in the
98:46 - ternary operator that you're using
98:49 - basically just goes if the height
98:51 - buttons prop is passed
98:54 - use this class that class displays none
98:59 - exactly damn boy really clean
99:03 - yeah really really clean and what we
99:05 - could do is this could actually be
99:07 - you can actually make this a quite easy
99:09 - like a quite neat
99:11 - um you can actually clean a lot of this
99:13 - up by putting it all inside of
99:15 - uh here so you can actually say class
99:17 - name
99:19 - but i mean we'll leave it as this
99:20 - because this is very explicit you can
99:21 - actually see what's going on but yeah
99:23 - you could make this even cleaner so
99:24 - what we're going to do at this point is
99:26 - we have done the search component
99:29 - right so we actually finished the search
99:30 - component so
99:32 - we have the search component down now
99:34 - what we want to do
99:36 - is whenever we whenever we essentially
99:40 - uh type something in the search field
99:42 - and we go to the search page
99:44 - we want to essentially push this search
99:47 - term into the data layer
99:50 - right we want to push this into the data
99:52 - so that we can use it
99:54 - in the search page right now the reason
99:57 - why you could do this in a number of
99:58 - ways you could use this you could also
99:59 - use react router to do this and
100:01 - pass the search term but it's always
100:03 - cool to show you guys how to use a sort
100:05 - of
100:05 - when i say the data layer i'm referring
100:07 - to the react context api
100:09 - yeah so the react context api is
100:11 - essentially where you can push
100:13 - information into it and you can pull
100:14 - information from internet and it's not
100:16 - and it doesn't matter
100:17 - where you are inside of your app right
100:21 - so it's essentially the redux pattern
100:23 - so what we're going to do now is i'm
100:24 - going to show you how to set up the data
100:26 - and i'm going to do it pretty fast
100:27 - and the reason why we're going to do it
100:28 - pretty fast is because we actually have
100:30 - an amazing little snippet
100:31 - where we explain how to use the entire
100:34 - react context api which we actually
100:35 - uploaded
100:36 - very recently which you can go out and
100:38 - check out after this if you get confused
100:40 - so let's go ahead and do the following
100:43 - so we need to introduce a few things
100:44 - here
100:45 - so inside of index.js we need to go
100:48 - ahead and do the following
100:50 - so this is our app we essentially need
100:52 - to wrap it
100:53 - in something called a state provider
100:55 - right so what this is going to do is
100:57 - essentially going to provide a data
100:58 - layer around our
100:59 - around our app right so it's going to be
101:03 - provide the data layer around our app
101:04 - and our app's going to break because it
101:06 - doesn't know what we're talking about
101:07 - here
101:08 - it's saying hang on but you don't have a
101:09 - state provider what is that so what we
101:11 - need to do is go ahead and create a file
101:13 - called
101:14 - state provider dot js
101:18 - right and inside of here i'm going to
101:20 - basically
101:21 - drop a snippet of code right and i'm
101:23 - going to explain each of the lines
101:25 - and like i said guys at this point if
101:27 - you get confused then remember we did we
101:29 - dropped a video which we explained the
101:32 - entire thing in a lot more detail about
101:34 - how you use the react context api
101:36 - right but i'll explain it right here
101:38 - ever in detail so that anyone watching
101:40 - can actually follow along
101:41 - so this is just importing the required
101:44 - dependencies
101:45 - this right here is basically preparing
101:48 - what we like to call the data layer so i
101:50 - i've referred to it as a data layer so
101:51 - it's actually easy to understand
101:53 - but this is essentially preparing the
101:55 - data layer
101:56 - right and then this right here
102:00 - is what we call a higher order component
102:02 - so you see it says state context and
102:04 - then children
102:05 - now the children that it's referring to
102:07 - is this so the app
102:09 - right the app is essentially the
102:10 - children that we're referring to here
102:11 - and then we pass two things we passed a
102:13 - reducer and an initial state
102:15 - a reducer an initial state you can see
102:17 - here i'll explain what they are
102:19 - in a second but essentially the initial
102:21 - state is what that data layer
102:23 - looks like when the app is loaded right
102:26 - the reducer is something which is clever
102:28 - and it listens to changes
102:30 - uh for the that will be needed from
102:32 - there that
102:33 - now this is a hook so this is a hook
102:36 - this is a hook
102:37 - which allows us which allows us to
102:40 - pull information from the data
102:47 - right so this is a hook which allows us
102:48 - to pull information from the data layer
102:50 - so with all of this information so this
102:53 - is again this is just one of those
102:54 - pieces of codes which is very very it's
102:56 - like a snippet of code
102:57 - which is going to allow you to actually
102:58 - set everything up so quick and easily
103:01 - right so make sure you do go ahead and
103:03 - check out that video that we talked
103:04 - about
103:04 - uh that we dropped and it's all about
103:06 - how you can pretty much understand the
103:08 - redux plan and understand the react
103:10 - context api
103:11 - but i'm going to show you the next thing
103:12 - that we need and we need
103:14 - the initial state and the reducer and
103:16 - all of this is going to live
103:18 - in a file called reducer.js it's
103:21 - lowercase because it's not a component
103:24 - so now we're inside of reducer.js so
103:26 - inside of here
103:28 - we're going to have a few things the
103:29 - first thing is we're going to have an
103:31 - initial state
103:32 - an initial state this is essentially
103:34 - what the date what does the data layer
103:36 - look like and you can notice as an
103:37 - object right and all we have inside this
103:40 - object is a term
103:41 - and in the beginning the term is no
103:43 - right but when we sort of add in
103:45 - so when you type in like elon musk you
103:47 - want this to change to something like
103:48 - this
103:49 - elon musk right so this is where the
103:51 - data is going to live
103:52 - inside of initial state right but
103:55 - initial state is essentially what it
103:56 - looks like when that first loads
103:59 - then we have something interesting
104:00 - called action types
104:02 - now here whenever we want to change the
104:05 - data layer
104:06 - we need to dispatch an action so imagine
104:08 - like if you
104:10 - whenever kazi types in the input field
104:12 - and hits the enter key
104:13 - i want to basically dispatch an action
104:15 - which says go ahead and change or set
104:18 - the search term right so this is what
104:21 - the action type is
104:22 - right so this is very important this is
104:23 - what the action type is in here we're
104:25 - just using
104:26 - set search term as our action type now
104:30 - to get all of this working we have one
104:32 - final piece of magic that goes along
104:34 - with everything and this
104:35 - is the reducer okay so this is the final
104:39 - bit and once we're done with this
104:40 - yeah everything will come together okay
104:42 - so so stick with me here
104:44 - so this is the final bit we have a
104:46 - reducer
104:48 - the state is the state of the data layer
104:50 - and the action is whatever we're
104:51 - dispatching
104:52 - into the into the data layer so into the
104:55 - the context
104:56 - api right i like to add a console log
104:59 - here
104:59 - for debugging purposes so that way
105:01 - whenever we do
105:02 - any manipulation to the data layer it
105:05 - will change
105:06 - um it will change it will actually log
105:08 - out the action that we dispatched
105:10 - right now what we do is inside the data
105:14 - layer so the reducer's job
105:15 - is to listen for any dispatched actions
105:19 - that's all it does if we don't know what
105:21 - the dispatch
105:22 - action is it just returns the initial
105:24 - whatever the state currently was
105:26 - but say for example if we know what it
105:27 - is so say for example if i dispatch
105:29 - an action called set search term like
105:32 - this one
105:33 - it's going to return what the new data
105:35 - layer should look like so this is saying
105:37 - return whatever the state currently
105:39 - looks like
105:40 - this is called a spread operator and
105:42 - then
105:43 - also change the term inside of the data
105:46 - with whatever action term you dispatched
105:50 - right so again this will make a lot of
105:52 - sense once we actually come into
105:54 - practice and we actually
105:55 - want to actually show you how this works
105:57 - and again just to reiterate
105:59 - this is um this is actually really
106:03 - broken down nicely
106:04 - and in a visual representation in one of
106:06 - the videos that we dropped previously
106:07 - and it says
106:08 - uh i think it's the missing explanation
106:10 - to the react context api
106:13 - uh or for slash redux so make sure you
106:15 - go and check that out
106:16 - because if somebody said you guys um i
106:18 - do you guys sell hoodies
106:21 - we should we should actually we should
106:23 - surely should
106:25 - yeah we should make some clever
106:27 - programming hoodies that'd be good
106:28 - that'd be nice yeah i would totally cop
106:29 - me as
106:30 - a cover program already yeah that'd be
106:32 - dope
106:34 - if somebody's good at that stuff
106:35 - designing uh hoodies and designing
106:38 - shirts
106:38 - and you also know about how things like
106:41 - teespring
106:42 - works just design it
106:45 - reach out to us on instagram like dm me
106:47 - and then i can actually we can have a
106:49 - conversation because
106:50 - that's something we want to launch we
106:52 - want to actually have a merch
106:54 - and so if you just dm me and you show me
106:56 - this stuff then we can actually like
106:58 - talk and
106:58 - make it kind of go live that'd be really
107:00 - really cool
107:02 - that'd be awesome nice so we've set up
107:05 - the reducer
107:06 - and now what we're going to do is to use
107:08 - this it's
107:09 - quite simple to actually so that was the
107:11 - hard part guys that was the that was the
107:12 - hardest part of
107:13 - the build right setting up this stuff
107:16 - and again we have a video which runs you
107:17 - through the entire thing so i recommend
107:19 - you go and check that out so
107:20 - we need to uh import some of the
107:22 - dependencies here so i'm going to import
107:24 - the reducer and the initial state from
107:26 - that reducer file and
107:27 - import the state provider from that
107:29 - magic statement provider file that we
107:31 - created earlier
107:32 - and you should have and you shouldn't
107:34 - have any errors when you get to this
107:35 - point so you should see
107:36 - the app continues to work as we expect
107:38 - it to
107:39 - but now what we've done is we've
107:40 - essentially wrapped the app inside of a
107:42 - data layer
107:43 - so we can push information into this
107:44 - data lab whenever we want so the search
107:46 - term for example
107:47 - and then we can also pull that data
107:49 - whenever we need to right
107:51 - so now let's go back into search and
107:53 - here what we do is to get that
107:54 - information remember that hook that we
107:56 - built inside of here so this one use
107:58 - state value
107:59 - all right we're going to go ahead and
108:00 - use that now inside of the search dot js
108:02 - so let's go ahead and go to search
108:05 - dot js over here and what i'm going to
108:07 - do is i'm going to go ahead and say this
108:09 - so i'm going to go ahead and pop this
108:11 - line in and basically we need to import
108:13 - the state value so that hook that i just
108:15 - showed you
108:15 - i need to import that and what we're
108:18 - doing here
108:19 - is this is actually it gives us two
108:21 - things it gives us the state so whatever
108:22 - the data layer looks like
108:24 - and a dispatch and this is like a gun
108:26 - that allows us to shoot
108:28 - actions into the data so that we can
108:30 - change it right
108:32 - so here what i'm going to say is break
108:34 - apart the state
108:35 - and give me the search term but in this
108:36 - case we don't need it right now
108:38 - but so i can just leave this blank all i
108:40 - need is a dispatch
108:42 - so whenever we type in the search field
108:44 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
108:45 - dispatch
108:47 - right i'm going to dispatch an action
108:49 - and the type of the action
108:51 - so i need to insert i need to import the
108:53 - action types
108:54 - from the reducer so this was this thing
108:56 - right here i need to import that so we
108:58 - have those i need to say dispatch a type
109:01 - of action
109:02 - and the type of the action is going to
109:04 - be action types dot set search term
109:07 - right and you can do it like you can do
109:10 - it as a loose string
109:11 - but the reason why we do an object is so
109:13 - that they match perfectly
109:15 - from here to here so if we use an object
109:18 - we don't actually make any string
109:19 - mistakes
109:20 - so that's why i do i do action types dot
109:23 - set search term
109:24 - and then remember inside the reducer
109:27 - here we had term
109:28 - and then we actually changed the term
109:30 - inside the the state with this
109:32 - action.term right
109:33 - so the action.term that we're talking
109:35 - about is here
109:36 - so term so if i pass an abc it's going
109:39 - to be abc but
109:40 - remember we actually track the input up
109:43 - here right so we want the term to be
109:45 - whatever the input was
109:47 - because that makes sense right that
109:48 - makes a lot of sense we just got another
109:50 - donation thank you rb gaming squad he
109:52 - says good work guys love your videos
109:54 - give some project ideas on react
109:56 - awesome dude thank you yeah so now what
109:59 - this does is it dispatches an
110:01 - action so not only are we going to push
110:03 - the user to the search page
110:05 - but now we've pushed them to the search
110:08 - page
110:08 - and we've also said here put the search
110:11 - term inside the data there
110:12 - right and then what that allows us to do
110:14 - then is inside the search component
110:16 - we can now pull the search term that
110:18 - they had when they were at the home page
110:20 - in that google
110:21 - input field so with that said qazi let's
110:23 - go ahead
110:24 - and uh refresh why is this freaking out
110:27 - it's saying
110:28 - you state there we go
110:33 - nice yeah so now let's go back to uh
110:37 - forward slash
110:41 - yep oh somebody said update the title
110:43 - yeah we should uh i guess we still are
110:45 - doing the search term
110:46 - but we yeah we basically just set up we
110:50 - just set up the react context api
110:52 - yeah i mean i guess the whole freaking
110:53 - thing is a google search
110:55 - you know like we're building google
110:56 - search i feel like we're never gonna
110:57 - change that we
110:58 - might as well just change it yeah so
111:01 - now what functionality are we building
111:05 - um
111:06 - so now what we're doing is where
111:10 - we well we just set up the react context
111:12 - api but we're going to be moving to
111:14 - building the search page
111:16 - okay yeah that's really good build
111:18 - search page
111:20 - yeah search results page right
111:24 - yep cool all right i think that
111:27 - is that i think that's clean like that
111:30 - looks really good i'm just gonna put a
111:32 - little
111:34 - yeah that's the official sound of we're
111:37 - on on to the new stuff
111:39 - awesome so steve mccarthy says also
111:42 - somebody has to keep an eye on sonny
111:45 - i'm not sure what he means so now
111:48 - yeah so now what we're gonna do is um
111:52 - we are going to go ahead and test this
111:55 - so because
111:55 - if you type in something like let's type
111:57 - in uh
111:59 - this is a google clone inside the input
112:01 - field
112:03 - okay
112:07 - okay yeah and now if you hit enter
112:11 - we should redirect and we should see
112:13 - that it dispatched an action do you see
112:19 - yeah so that means that now we actually
112:22 - updated the term inside of our data
112:24 - layer to google clone which means inside
112:26 - this component now inside the search
112:27 - component
112:28 - we should be able to pull it right we
112:30 - should be able to put it
112:32 - so how do we do that let's go ahead and
112:35 - go to our home.js go to your app.js
112:38 - this is the search page that we see at
112:40 - the moment this is a search page but
112:41 - this is useless
112:43 - we want to see a search page component
112:45 - we want to see something like this
112:49 - yeah this is the search page right
112:53 - so let's go ahead and create that
112:55 - component so i'm going to go ahead and
112:56 - do search
112:57 - page dot js and then once that loads up
113:00 - i'm going to do rfce
113:03 - so rfce and boom like this
113:08 - i just want to share something so i
113:10 - dropped it in our pwj community
113:13 - uh that frank just landed a hundred
113:15 - thousand a year
113:16 - consulting project at sonos to build
113:18 - their new react uh
113:21 - our radio station product with react and
113:23 - react native
113:24 - and then david jonathan who was actually
113:27 - on these live streams if you remember
113:30 - yeah he's now in pwj and he's like
113:32 - congrats frank really excited for you my
113:34 - friend so
113:34 - uh soren who's awesome and then devin
113:36 - gray who also was on these live streams
113:39 - goes that's dope especially because i
113:42 - hate their current radio station apps
113:44 - please fix it so i can enjoy it sonos
113:46 - soon
113:48 - again and then frank um you know the
113:51 - person who actually got this one he goes
113:54 - i'm so excited to share this win with
113:55 - the entire community damn that's amazing
113:57 - dude
113:58 - it makes me so happy guys like i like
114:01 - the video for frank
114:03 - yeah exactly so guys like
114:06 - it's it's really like a no-brainer when
114:08 - you see that kind of stuff like
114:10 - the course whatever the course costs
114:12 - frank just made six figures
114:14 - inside right and literally and i shared
114:16 - this too with everybody like two weeks
114:18 - before that
114:19 - jen got an offer for 96k a year
114:22 - based on the covet tracker project so
114:24 - these are
114:25 - like i said here these projects that
114:27 - we're showing you are
114:28 - as real world as it gets yeah
114:32 - and like truth be told like what we're
114:34 - offering the course for at the moment
114:36 - is hugely underpriced like we will be
114:38 - pushing the price up
114:39 - soon so it should be 5 000
114:42 - 10 000 like you know coding boot camps
114:44 - but we are
114:46 - offering it in a way where more people
114:48 - can actually join it
114:50 - exactly exactly so that guy's like jump
114:53 - in why you got a chance because it will
114:55 - go up eventually and and
114:56 - because i mean like it's so much like
114:58 - the price is guaranteed it already went
115:00 - up and now it's gonna go up again
115:02 - when we do the react challenge in one to
115:05 - two weeks from now
115:07 - yeah exactly and also if you're pumped
115:09 - about that drop a thumbs up
115:11 - nice that would be fun yeah yeah so
115:14 - we're going to add a class name for bam
115:16 - so let's say class search page
115:18 - let's carry on guys so let's go ahead
115:19 - and do import
115:22 - search page dot css
115:25 - over here i'm going to go ahead and
115:27 - create that page so search page dot css
115:30 - search page css over there and we should
115:32 - go inside
115:32 - sonny if you get the 2k likes i'll buy
115:35 - you dinner tomorrow
115:37 - oh nice
115:38 - [Laughter]
115:40 - let's go guys
115:48 - oh man that's so funny you heard it here
115:51 - first guys get me those 500 likes
115:53 - yeah what if like that was your biggest
115:55 - driver
115:57 - i know right it's getting free dinner
116:04 - [Laughter]
116:09 - he's just on the streets like homeless
116:11 - bum coding in php
116:15 - building clones oh man
116:20 - let's go so we got the search page
116:23 - uh and now inside the search okay so the
116:26 - search page is one of the most sort of
116:29 - like
116:29 - fun components to build and we'll go
116:31 - through it and we'll break it down bit
116:33 - by bit
116:34 - um but basically it consists of a bunch
116:36 - of different sections so
116:38 - we'll stick to the way we do things
116:40 - typically and the search page currently
116:42 - has a header
116:43 - so let's go ahead and add that so we've
116:45 - got a div of the class name
116:48 - of search page
116:51 - this is search page underscore
116:54 - underscore
116:54 - uh header like this
116:58 - and i don't know why it does that but
116:59 - here we go so we've got this right so
117:01 - we've got the header at the top of the
117:02 - search page
117:03 - and then we have the search results
117:04 - underneath it right so the search
117:06 - results are going to be
117:08 - essentially underneath it here so we
117:10 - have the header
117:11 - and we have the results so two sections
117:13 - inside of here
117:16 - like this right we've got the header and
117:18 - the results and what we can do guys to
117:20 - test this out and have a little bit of
117:21 - fun
117:22 - remember we just pushed a value into the
117:24 - data layer so let's go ahead and
117:25 - actually check
117:26 - if that value came through so remember i
117:28 - said that when we
117:30 - whenever we grab a value from the data
117:31 - layer it gives us the state and the
117:33 - dispatch
117:33 - right so what i can do is firstly i need
117:35 - to go ahead and import the state
117:37 - value hook so use state value like this
117:40 - and here what i'm going to do is
117:41 - i'm going to destructure the state and
117:43 - say get me the search term
117:44 - which we put inside the state and now
117:48 - what i'm going to do is just to test if
117:49 - this works i'm going to say
117:52 - render a h1 tag with that search term
117:55 - inside of it
117:55 - if it exists right so this should be
117:58 - correct like this
117:59 - and then here so now if i go ahead and
118:02 - do say it says search page is not
118:04 - defined
118:05 - so now if we go to home.js
118:09 - and we go here search page inside of
118:12 - home
118:13 - hey ananya says he goes qazi
118:16 - i will be joining pwj in a few
118:19 - awesome once you're in there i will know
118:22 - you're in there in slack just give a
118:23 - shout out and tag me
118:25 - and i'm going to respond to you and then
118:26 - tomorrow livestream uh
118:28 - will definitely show that you have
118:29 - joined it i think that's going to be
118:31 - epic
118:32 - yeah that would be dope that'd be
118:34 - awesome
118:36 - search page
118:42 - no no that's fine yeah i'm good i'm good
118:46 - so if we save this now what we should
118:48 - see is
118:50 - inside i think hajira and the youtube
118:52 - comments will know what i'm talking
118:53 - about and maybe like one
118:55 - one or two people might but i'm not
118:57 - gonna say anything let's keep going
119:00 - yeah right so now if i save it what we
119:04 - should have
119:05 - is it says module okay yeah oops
119:07 - somebody actually pointed that out
119:09 - before so i saw that thank you guys uh
119:11 - so if i do that now so
119:13 - because if you want to go to the forward
119:15 - slash so let's go back to the forward
119:17 - slash
119:24 - yeah and now this go ahead and type in
119:28 - like
119:28 - any search term history tesla stock or
119:30 - something like that
119:41 - nice you're muted
119:46 - for a while okay all right so i
119:49 - basically said a
119:50 - robin hood app i mean that's not that
119:52 - interesting anymore
119:54 - and i said i love that you're actually
119:56 - pulling the search term man and showing
119:58 - it on the screen
119:59 - now we're actually able to uh get the
120:02 - search and actually query it and i'm
120:04 - sure
120:05 - the part that's coming up soon is going
120:07 - to be the google
120:08 - search api yeah exactly
120:12 - exactly yeah so guys dude frank this is
120:15 - awesome frank just said
120:17 - i can make uh hold up hold up i'm i'm
120:20 - getting uh
120:21 - ajira's like i know right all right
120:23 - frank basically says um
120:26 - i can make the shopify site for the cp
120:28 - shirts and hoodies
120:30 - that is awesome frank actually that
120:31 - would be really dope would love to like
120:33 - share it with everybody
120:37 - well it says easy i can make the shop oh
120:39 - nice kenny oh sick
120:41 - yeah so yeah that would be sick
120:44 - um awesome so we've got the rubbing head
120:47 - up being pulled through so the search
120:49 - term gets pulled through now which is
120:50 - nice right
120:53 - now obviously what we want to do at this
120:55 - point is we just want to kind of run a
120:57 - search on that right so i want to
120:59 - actually go ahead and connect to google
121:03 - and run a search on it right so what do
121:06 - we need to do in order to get that
121:07 - working so
121:08 - firstly we actually need a key so we're
121:11 - going to be using something called the
121:13 - custom search
121:14 - api so kazi if you go ahead and go over
121:17 - to
121:17 - this link right now i'm going to drop it
121:20 - inside of
121:21 - i'm going to drop it inside of um inside
121:23 - of here so you see it
121:25 - got it yes let's go let's go to that
121:27 - link command t command v
121:29 - enter by the way guys all of you guys
121:31 - should be doing that

122:43 - where is this it was in this page so let
122:45 - me go ahead and find this
122:47 - what are you looking for basically we
122:49 - need to get a
122:50 - api key so what you want to do is click
122:54 - on that um
122:56 - okay yeah so click on the identify your
122:58 - application so go up to the top
123:00 - so you see where i didn't i got it so
123:03 - you're going to click on that guys
123:04 - go to this link yeah click on get a key
123:06 - so this is the custom search api
123:08 - should i have it uh yeah yeah so you
123:12 - want to hide the screen yeah
123:14 - i'm hiding the screen yeah so
123:17 - at this point so you could probably show
123:20 - this bit quasi but don't click
123:21 - next yeah all right i'll show this bit
123:23 - right over here
123:24 - api okay so um
123:28 - let me actually switch to my other
123:30 - account real quick
123:33 - and now give me one second you guys now
123:35 - i'm gonna click get a key
123:37 - all right and um here
123:41 - on the create a project i'll choose the
123:43 - project that we're creating right now
123:44 - yeah
123:45 - the google clone yep and don't click
123:48 - next once you've done that but
123:49 - google click on the google chrome now
123:51 - i'm going to click next
123:53 - i'm gonna click all right i'll hide my
123:56 - screen
123:56 - next yeah it's gonna hide your screen
124:00 - and then click next and then what will
124:01 - happen here guys
124:02 - is you will get an api key right so you
124:06 - want to save this key
124:07 - and the reason why we're not showing you
124:09 - guys the key is because
124:10 - you have a free limit of 100 queries a
124:13 - day
124:13 - right which is enough for a portfolio
124:15 - but we don't want to
124:16 - like it's just it's just oh that's nice
124:18 - dude come on
124:20 - bro your boy is clean guys your key will
124:23 - look like this
124:25 - you know i didn't do that doing a little
124:28 - bit of live editing
124:30 - so that's what that page should look
124:32 - like by the way i'm just hiding mine
124:34 - yeah
124:35 - yeah hide it before you click save and
124:36 - copy here
124:38 - cool all right so now what are we doing
124:40 - sonny what do i do with that
124:42 - now awesome so once you have that key
124:45 - guys
124:46 - what you're going to do is let's go
124:47 - ahead and create a keys.js file so i'm
124:49 - going to go ahead and create keys
124:52 - dot js file okay like this
124:55 - yeah and what i'm going to do here is
124:58 - i'm basically going to hold on hold on
124:59 - hold on we're not looking at anything
125:00 - you're doing bro one second
125:02 - oh yeah so i just i just created the
125:04 - keys.js file i see it
125:06 - yeah so now what i'm going to do is i'm
125:09 - going to go ahead
125:10 - and give me one sec
125:14 - let's go ahead and do the following so
125:17 - you want to write the following inside
125:19 - of that so export const
125:21 - right so export cons api key and it
125:24 - equals your api key right and then
125:27 - export default api key so this is going
125:29 - to allow you
125:30 - to essentially uh put that value here
125:33 - and then use the api key throughout your
125:35 - app
125:35 - all right so at this point what we're
125:37 - going to do
125:38 - is uh i'm going to leave this screen so
125:41 - so
125:42 - and i'm going to ask quasi to replace
125:44 - this on his key
125:46 - actually unfollow me quasi for a sec bro
125:52 - do you want me to create like an end
125:53 - file and then pop it in there
125:56 - no we can do m-files but i think for
125:58 - this build we'll do it this way because
126:00 - they won't see this are you gonna you're
126:02 - gonna remember never to go into that
126:03 - file
126:05 - yeah all right let's do it bro i'm
126:08 - ready let's go hey
126:12 - i just pasted it nobody can see it oh
126:14 - wait okay
126:17 - [Laughter]
126:28 - level like you got to actually add and
126:30 - add in some hand eye coordination
126:32 - like mobility yeah just
126:36 - pretty cool so you want to basically
126:40 - you want to hide that so because you
126:41 - want to close that file just in case
126:43 - okay i just saved it i'm closed out of
126:45 - it all right
126:46 - okay so now we have access to our api
126:49 - key right so wherever we are we can
126:51 - access
126:51 - access to it so i think you might need
126:53 - to follow me again after that stuff
126:55 - somebody says qazi
126:58 - you're looking sexy bro
127:02 - thank you bro i appreciate it i
127:06 - appreciate it
127:07 - yeah john john james valencia cardona
127:11 - says one click away and you're
127:13 - busted
127:16 - yeah no it's all good you know i like to
127:18 - be smooth like that
127:20 - we like to live on the edge guys nice
127:23 - so with that what we're going to do now
127:25 - is go ahead and we're going to create
127:28 - a custom hook right so we've never done
127:30 - this before yeah we're at 184 dollars
127:32 - in super chats today dude that is crazy
127:36 - that is absolutely crazy i mean we might
127:39 - we might even break 200 today but you
127:41 - know let's keep going
127:44 - insane so guys what we're going to do
127:46 - now
127:47 - is we are going to go over to so in
127:50 - order to
127:50 - actually use the uh the google search
127:54 - uh sort of search uh api you actually
127:57 - have to do one more step right so you
127:58 - have to go ahead and go
127:59 - over to this link causey so this one
128:01 - here this is cse.google.com
128:03 - for cse create new so click that one
128:06 - okay i'm gonna and i can share i'm gonna
128:08 - show that on the computer right
128:09 - yeah yeah this this stuff we can share
128:11 - all right because
128:12 - this even if they have this i hate how
128:14 - nothing in google is responsive like
128:17 - look at that
128:18 - yeah it's super cool like firebase was
128:21 - actually
128:22 - frank told me this firebase was a
128:23 - startup company and i remember because i
128:25 - actually followed them when they were
128:26 - start before
128:27 - they got acquired by google yeah quick
128:30 - question
128:31 - yup um so uh should
128:35 - does it should it be all under the same
128:37 - email or does it
128:38 - not matter because this is a different
128:41 - email i'm looking at right now
128:42 - then you know what i'm saying oh uh yeah
128:46 - let's make it the same let's just just
128:48 - so because
128:48 - we ran into some stuff on the live but
128:50 - let's change it yeah i mean i want to
128:51 - change it but it's kind of not allowing
128:54 - me to
128:54 - like you know what i mean like it
128:56 - doesn't even give me the option right
128:57 - here if you're seeing that
128:59 - uh click sign out
129:03 - um okay
129:06 - god i hate doing that okay like my whole
129:09 - sinking is paused and my entire
129:11 - bookmarks
129:13 - oh my god what are you doing to me bro
129:18 - you know what you know what hold on hold
129:19 - on i'm not going to do that i'm i'm
129:21 - going to stay locked in oh
129:22 - you don't get incognito maybe yeah i was
129:25 - just going to do the incognito
129:27 - all right because your approach is it's
129:30 - too costly
129:32 - all right here we go create new
129:37 - let's open up incognito paste
129:43 - boom there we go now type in my email
129:53 - okay that should be good to go in a
129:55 - second
129:56 - okay it's asking me to verify on my
129:58 - phone
129:59 - nice and guys if you're enjoying this
130:01 - and you found like quite valuable
130:03 - whether it be like the react context api
130:06 - whether it be like this stuff what we're
130:07 - doing right now just literally
130:09 - all we ask is you smash the thumbs up
130:10 - button oh man that will help get this
130:12 - video
130:12 - out to as many people as we possibly can
130:15 - i wish there were more hurdles for me to
130:17 - jump over to get to this page but
130:20 - all right what do we do now right now
130:23 - what we're going to do is we're going to
130:24 - type in www.google.com
130:28 - so google.com and then
130:31 - what we're going to do is we'll just
130:32 - name this one google click create
130:34 - but we're not done there because they
130:36 - don't make it that easy this is kind of
130:38 - like aws
130:39 - so you want to basically go to edit
130:41 - search engine
130:43 - what where on the left on the left
130:47 - so yep and then click on
130:50 - setup
130:54 - yep and here you see where it says
130:57 - so let's go down
131:01 - uh down and then search the entire web
131:03 - click uh toggle that
131:06 - oh wow nice yeah
131:10 - and what's it called and then what we're
131:12 - going to do
131:13 - is uh we're going to go up
131:18 - let's go up to a search engine id so you
131:22 - see where it says search engine id you
131:23 - just want to grab that id
131:25 - got it yeah and let's just uh
131:29 - let's paste that inside so keep hold of
131:32 - that for now yeah
131:33 - so guys you're going to need that so
131:34 - keep a part of that and what i'm going
131:36 - to do is i'm going to create a file
131:38 - called use google search right use
131:41 - google search dot js so you anything
131:43 - that has used in front of it
131:45 - is a hook right so hey come on bro
131:48 - exactly so here i'm going to say rfce
131:52 - so like this and i'm actually going to
131:54 - go ahead and change a few things i want
131:56 - to say con so i want this to be an es6
131:58 - function it doesn't make a difference
131:59 - but it's going to be super clean
132:00 - are we still live
132:04 - okay yeah should still be uh okay it
132:06 - says my
132:07 - chat is disconnected so i'm just gonna
132:09 - refresh hopefully
132:12 - um hopefully everything keep going keep
132:15 - going sunny and then yeah i'm just
132:17 - joking
132:18 - okay no worries so now we
132:21 - where we have used google search i'm
132:22 - going to go ahead and it's not we don't
132:24 - need any of this stuff because it's not
132:26 - actually like a component like that as
132:27 - such
132:28 - but what we do need is we don't even
132:29 - need to import react because it's
132:31 - actually
132:31 - we need to use state and use effect so
132:33 - i'm going to import those two things
132:35 - and then i'm going to import the api key
132:38 - that we just
132:39 - sort of set up earlier from our keys so
132:41 - i'm going to import that key from our
132:43 - keys
132:44 - and then what i'm going to do is um
132:48 - save it oh kazi can you see my i can't
132:51 - see my code on your screen
132:53 - um okay let me
132:56 - wait why is that i'm fine yep we're back
133:00 - now we're back yeah
133:00 - yeah so now where it says use google
133:03 - search what i'm going to do here is i'm
133:04 - going to basically go ahead and put in
133:06 - the context key over here so i'm going
133:07 - to make a const contact
133:09 - uh context key and then cause if you
133:11 - want to replace this
133:12 - key with so this one right here replace
133:16 - that with our key that we just had got
133:18 - it let me do that
133:21 - boom done yeah so you're going to need
133:24 - this context key and that basically
133:25 - tells google
133:26 - which search engine to use so the one
133:28 - that we just created which searches the
133:29 - entire web
133:30 - that's the one that we want now what
133:32 - we're going to do is we're going to
133:33 - create a piece of states this is how you
133:35 - use it this is how you make a custom
133:37 - hook right
133:38 - so here what we're going to do is this
133:40 - hook is going to have its own piece of
133:42 - state
133:42 - called data right it's gonna have its
133:44 - own piece of state called data
133:46 - right so like it's just like a
133:47 - functional component does it's gonna
133:48 - have its own
133:49 - and this hook whenever we use it has a
133:53 - use effect right so whenever we use this
133:55 - hook
133:55 - it's gonna fire off a use effect and
133:58 - this use effect is dependent
134:00 - on term so term here right now so what
134:03 - we're saying is
134:04 - whenever and term we pass in by the way
134:07 - and we pass the term as a value inside
134:09 - the hook
134:09 - so what we're doing here is we're saying
134:11 - we pass in term
134:13 - to this inside of this uh this hook and
134:15 - then whenever term changes we're going
134:17 - to fire off this code inside of here
134:19 - okay it's essentially what we're saying
134:22 - now
134:22 - we need to do an async fetch right so
134:26 - some kind of function sunny real quick
134:28 - sunny real quick
134:30 - do i need this open any longer this here
134:34 - no okay yeah i'm just gonna keep it
134:38 - there like accessible anyway and then
134:41 - let's go
134:42 - to our local host now what your
134:46 - so what you're explaining about this
134:47 - term
134:49 - what you mean by this is if
134:52 - so the term is going to be whatever
134:53 - somebody types in here
134:56 - yes yep is that is that right or am i
134:59 - making that up
135:00 - no no that's correct yeah because
135:02 - remember what we do is we type it in
135:03 - there
135:04 - then we dispatch it into the data layer
135:06 - so it's now sitting in the data layer
135:08 - and then when the search page we're
135:10 - going to be doing is pulling that term
135:12 - and we're just going to be using this is
135:14 - a data layer variable
135:16 - so this will be the this will be a data
135:18 - layer variable yes
135:19 - got it okay so data layer and then
135:23 - whenever this changes is when we want
135:26 - this use effect to be called
135:28 - this hook to be called exactly yeah so
135:31 - for example
135:32 - if we not only typed in a new search
135:36 - not only did we hit enter on this new
135:38 - search
135:39 - but we passed it to our data layer our
135:42 - data layer
135:43 - got a new term like elon musk or
135:45 - whatever
135:47 - and then it fires this use effect
135:50 - and this use effect basically will get
135:53 - all the search results
135:55 - using the google yeah right and then
135:58 - take you to the search results page
136:01 - uh so it doesn't it doesn't take you to
136:03 - the search results but it'll get the
136:04 - search results
136:06 - yeah this is responsible for getting the
136:08 - search so when you get the search
136:09 - results are we putting that in the data
136:10 - layer as well where are we putting the
136:12 - results when we get them
136:14 - no no so this is actually a hook which
136:16 - means that like
136:18 - so imagine inside of the so this will
136:20 - return some data so you see here
136:22 - and then what happens is we pretty much
136:24 - will use it like this we'll say got it
136:26 - got it
136:27 - data equals use google search
136:30 - okay okay got it so it'll return the
136:32 - data and then we have access to it and
136:34 - then we just display it on the page
136:36 - okay exactly yeah so it's a really clean
136:40 - hook like this is i'm
136:41 - i was quite proud of him when i wrote
136:42 - this today like it's a really really
136:44 - nice hook
136:45 - and it's super clean like at the end
136:47 - result is really nice so
136:48 - um what we do is here we need to
136:50 - basically we want to
136:52 - do some kind of async fetch inside of
136:54 - and use effect and now whenever you have
136:56 - an async use a async function or async
136:59 - any action inside the user effect
137:01 - you have to make a function so for
137:03 - example here i do const fetch data
137:05 - and this is going to be an async
137:07 - function
137:09 - all right so it's an async function and
137:12 - what we're saying
137:12 - is um uh we're saying
137:15 - fetch right and then we're gonna put the
137:18 - url
137:19 - so i'm gonna use backticks because i'm
137:20 - gonna do string interpolation and i'm
137:22 - basically gonna go ahead and pop in
137:25 - uh the following so this is the url you
137:27 - guys are going to need
137:28 - right so this is the url that you guys
137:29 - are going to need so you can pretty much
137:30 - pause the video copy it do what you got
137:32 - to do
137:32 - and this is the endpoint that connects
137:34 - to google's custom search api
137:37 - and what happens is we pass in a key
137:39 - right
137:40 - we pass in a context which is the search
137:42 - engine the cx
137:43 - and this is takes the context key that
137:45 - we just put at the top and it takes a
137:47 - term so this is
137:48 - q stands for query and this is the term
137:50 - that we pass in right
137:52 - so that what because we set everything
137:55 - up
137:56 - what we can say is we can say make the
137:58 - response
137:59 - when you get back a response so when you
138:01 - get the response back
138:03 - go ahead and change the response into
138:06 - a response.json so basically get the
138:09 - json
138:10 - from the response right and this
138:11 - shouldn't be capitals it should be
138:13 - so i'm going to make this very clear i'm
138:14 - going to say response hey
138:18 - let's go you don't need marabon to buy
138:21 - you dinner anymore frankie
138:23 - frank it says sonny and qazi would love
138:26 - to send you guys an uber eats credit as

138:34 - that's so dope thank you dude that's
138:36 - insane
138:37 - thank you bro yeah thanks for saying
138:42 - thank you dude all right so now what
138:45 - we're gonna do
138:46 - is we are going to so we basically said
138:48 - when we get the response back
138:50 - we want to say change the response to
138:53 - get the json from the response
138:55 - and then what we're going to do is once
138:57 - we do that you can chain the ends up by
138:59 - the way guys so you can actually chain
139:00 - them up so we're going to say then
139:01 - whatever the result is so that json that
139:03 - you're talking about
139:04 - we're going to basically set that we're
139:07 - going to set the data
139:08 - to that result right so this is very
139:10 - interesting what we're doing here
139:12 - we're saying the data the piece of state
139:15 - that is par
139:16 - inside of this hook right we're setting
139:19 - that data
139:20 - right and then what we're doing is we
139:22 - need to execute that function so we're
139:23 - saying fetch there so this is actually
139:26 - a custom hook so this entire thing
139:30 - is a custom hook this is an example of
139:32 - like like you have use state use effect
139:34 - use everything
139:35 - whatever you want to do this is an
139:36 - example of a use google search we just
139:38 - created a custom hook
139:40 - okay and like the power of this is
139:43 - insane because what we're doing at the
139:44 - end is
139:45 - we're saying return data as an object
139:48 - it returns an object okay got it yes it
139:51 - returns an object yeah
139:52 - so now what we can do is we can actually
139:54 - go ahead and test this so we can go
139:56 - ahead and do this we can say go back to
139:58 - search page and we can say const data so
140:01 - whatever's
140:02 - returned as an object like what we saw
140:05 - use google search
140:09 - like this right and remember google
140:10 - search took a term
140:12 - right so it took some kind of time and
140:14 - that term we're pulling from the data
140:15 - layer
140:17 - right so that's going to be it's by
140:20 - default it's going to do this
140:21 - right so now what we can say is
140:24 - we can say i need to import the use
140:26 - google search so let's go ahead and do
140:28 - that so use google search let's go ahead
140:31 - and import that
140:34 - from the top here nice
140:37 - and now hold on one minute where did you
140:40 - import it
140:42 - at the top oh wait um how come i don't
140:46 - see it
140:47 - uh oh it's gonna have sync one sec um
140:50 - can you fix that i'm gonna highlight
140:52 - this comment this is a good comment by
140:54 - frank
140:54 - oh a good idea is to start with fetch
140:58 - since you don't need external
140:59 - dependencies and i recommend that as
141:01 - well
141:02 - once you start getting more familiar you
141:04 - guys can use
141:05 - axios as a powerful upgrade
141:08 - so that's what i would recommend for you
141:10 - guys like use axios later just first
141:12 - do it like this and here is the import
141:14 - use google search from use google search
141:19 - yeah exactly so
141:22 - i agree with uh with what firing said so
141:25 - you want to actually use fetch first
141:26 - because it just keeps everything clean
141:28 - axios is something really good though
141:30 - once you once you sort of get used to it
141:31 - and you get used to
141:32 - how it works um so we have this constant
141:35 - area called use google search term right
141:37 - so now what we're going to do is just to
141:39 - test this as well so i'm going to
141:40 - console.log
141:42 - the data right so my snippets are
141:44 - working console.log data
141:46 - like this right now if i save this let's
141:49 - go ahead and save this right so kazi
141:51 - if you want to type in like tesla for
141:53 - example right
141:55 - yeah so now before you don't hit insane
141:57 - uh sorry don't hit um
142:00 - enter yeah what the hell
142:03 - i don't know something
142:06 - something popped up and it was like
142:08 - insane content it was like a
142:09 - notification
142:10 - oh yeah yeah so something popped up
142:14 - i kind of was like but here don't hit
142:17 - enter yet
142:18 - uh type in like tesla or something
142:21 - got it so let's go to tesla
142:25 - oh don't hit enter yet you said right oh
142:28 - that's fine so you know
142:29 - okay you so so let's clear the uh the
142:31 - search
142:32 - so let's clear the the sort of um
142:34 - inspector
142:37 - no no no so so go back so
142:41 - go back to uh okay
142:46 - yeah nice so now they're typing tesla
142:52 - yeah and what we do now is whenever when
142:54 - we hit enter a few things are going to
142:55 - happen right
142:56 - we're going to hit enter it's going to
142:59 - redirect us
143:00 - to the forward slash search page right
143:03 - then what's going to happen
143:04 - is it's going to push tesla the search
143:07 - term
143:07 - into the data layer where it's going to
143:09 - push that into the data layer
143:11 - once that's in the data layer you can
143:13 - see in search page we pull it by using
143:15 - use state value so now we have that
143:17 - search term
143:18 - and then we use our custom hook that we
143:20 - created called use google search
143:22 - we pass that term and then we extra that
143:24 - will end up making a call to the google
143:26 - uh custom search api and then we return
143:29 - the data as an
143:30 - object right so it's a super super clean
143:34 - implementation of this now kazi if you
143:36 - want to go ahead and hit enter
143:40 - hit enter now boom yep so hit enter
143:44 - and if you see it passed so let's go
143:46 - ahead and click that yeah
143:48 - so this entire response is from google
143:50 - now so let's go ahead and click item
143:52 - hold on my face is blocking a lot of
143:54 - stuff
143:55 - yo damn tay has just donated a hundred
143:58 - uh rupees thank you so much for that
144:01 - it's crazy because uh because yeah
144:03 - earlier it got wild in there and i
144:05 - booted him out of chat because i got
144:07 - like i'm like man i don't like the vibes
144:10 - here but then
144:10 - he explained that he was following our
144:12 - content and been viewing it
144:14 - and i was like okay okay and then he
144:16 - came from another account so
144:18 - you know and thank you for the donation
144:20 - i really really appreciate that
144:22 - so i'm gonna what i'm gonna do is i'm
144:24 - blocking
144:25 - it a little bit right now so let's go
144:28 - like this and i think i'll make it even
144:29 - bigger so everybody can really see it
144:31 - clearly
144:32 - and this is what we're getting back you
144:34 - guys
144:35 - yeah so let's click on the items drop
144:38 - down so that's the one that will show us
144:39 - some interesting stuff so we search for
144:41 - tesla right
144:42 - so let's go ahead and click on the first
144:44 - item in the array
144:46 - okay so let's go ahead and click it so
144:48 - when you say first item you mean zeroth
144:50 - item
144:51 - yeah zero okay okay got it not trying to
144:53 - be a dick
144:55 - it's got like it's got like some tesla
144:58 - stuff inside there right
144:59 - so you can see that's actually returning
145:01 - a search term like a search result which
145:03 - and it has a bunch of information
145:05 - wow even the display link
145:07 - teslatheban.com
145:08 - the first one is tesla.com that would
145:11 - make sense
145:12 - yeah so he's actually going ahead it's
145:15 - using google to actually go ahead and do
145:17 - this right
145:18 - so remember don't spam this because
145:20 - you're gonna have a hundred
145:22 - limit i think it's a hundred limit free
145:23 - limit a day and then you can pretty much
145:25 - put a card on and then you can
145:27 - if you want to pay for it you have a
145:28 - huge limit after that for like five
145:29 - dollars but
145:30 - i would say stick to the three quarter
145:32 - and i'll show you a little trick now
145:33 - right
145:34 - so that entire response that cars you
145:36 - just got right so if you go ahead and
145:39 - open up the network final quasi ah okay
145:42 - i will
145:44 - yeah so go up network and click
145:47 - on um the so let's go ahead and make
145:50 - that a little bigger
145:51 - and let's just put the camera on us for
145:53 - a second because i don't want to show
145:55 - something
145:55 - it's going to check if it's good yeah
145:59 - yeah so let's go to all
146:03 - all okay so you know the camera is on us
146:06 - right now right
146:07 - yeah yeah that's fine i just want to
146:09 - check one thing before we do it so you
146:11 - see that bottom
146:11 - the on where it says v1 key equals
146:17 - yeah yeah click that so you see it
146:20 - it's going to end up showing the key
146:21 - here so if you click that and then you
146:23 - um make this bigger yes so click down
146:25 - click on response
146:28 - yep right there yeah so what we can do
146:31 - here
146:32 - is uh you can actually say if you drop
146:35 - blur this
146:35 - so make a screenshot of this and blur
146:37 - out the key on the left on the bottom
146:39 - left
146:41 - hold on is this the key yeah so
146:44 - basically
146:44 - let's do it let's do a screenshot of
146:46 - this and show them how we got to this so
146:47 - just draw some arrows that you click on
146:49 - the network tab
146:50 - you click on that um and then you click
146:52 - on the response to see
146:54 - does that make sense yeah all right so
146:57 - all right cool hold on i got you bro i
146:59 - got you don't worry don't even trip dog
147:03 - all right we got this here yeah
147:06 - all right now i'm gonna do this very
147:08 - carefully by the way i'm not showing it
147:10 - right now right
147:11 - it's good it's good it's good all right
147:13 - cool yeah so step one click network guys
147:16 - and then step two make sure you click
147:18 - response over here
147:20 - and then this is gonna show you and
147:22 - these are all the results
147:25 - right here yeah
147:28 - so this is really important guys so the
147:30 - reason why i was
147:31 - making this a point because once you see
147:34 - this response i want you to go ahead and
147:36 - do command a on that response and
147:38 - actually copy
147:40 - everything right so copy everything now
147:42 - this is really handy for when you're
147:44 - developing because
147:45 - you don't want to keep attacking the the
147:47 - api
147:48 - because you run out of your quota if we
147:50 - keep doing that while we're developing
147:51 - we're going to easily use up 100
147:52 - requests
147:53 - so we basically should we should we put
147:56 - it in
147:56 - so command a to select everything go
147:59 - into your actual response command a to
148:01 - select everything and then command c
148:03 - to copy everything now where should i
148:05 - put it should i just make a new file
148:07 - with like response
148:09 - yep so response.js response.js
148:13 - so i'm going to pop it the entire
148:16 - response
148:16 - into here and i will go
148:19 - and get out of my network tab and i'll
148:21 - go back to console
148:22 - hit x now i'm going to share my screen
148:25 - with everybody
148:26 - and now here this is the full response
148:29 - that we got back
148:31 - now what are we getting back in this
148:32 - response you guys like
148:34 - it's everything that you would type in
148:36 - if you typed in tesla that's kind of
148:37 - what you would get from google itself so
148:39 - if i just go to google.com
148:41 - and i type in tesla i imagine i would
148:45 - get the
148:46 - what would i get so there's tesla.com
148:49 - so let's see if it actually has that so
148:51 - let me look up tesla.com
148:53 - it has that yep and
148:56 - tesla is accelerating the world's
148:58 - transition to sustainable
149:01 - so see tesla is accelerating the world's
149:03 - transition to sustainable energy
149:06 - with electric so it's like actually
149:08 - giving me what
149:09 - the real google would give me
149:12 - yeah and you see this the display link
149:15 - is www.tesla.com
149:17 - which is you can see it right there
149:18 - which is awesome
149:20 - yeah exactly displaylink is tesla.com
149:23 - and then the display link
149:25 - for the next one is also yeah let's go
149:28 - down
149:30 - yeah tesla the band starts to show up
149:32 - soon
149:33 - dope okay so it may not be exactly to
149:36 - what the what google has done but it is
149:38 - is pulling it from google because
149:40 - remember they might have set their the
149:41 - engine up slightly different but
149:43 - yeah the point is it will get the
149:44 - majority of the search terms right
149:46 - thank you thank you tejas for another
149:48 - donation thank you onorak for
149:50 - another donation and anurag actually
149:54 - says check the dm
149:55 - for merch that he made for us so that is
149:59 - awesome
150:02 - all right so with that said guys we got
150:05 - that massive response right
150:07 - so how do we actually let's pass that
150:09 - response
150:10 - into something that we can use and the
150:12 - way we can do that
150:13 - is if i go ahead to the top of the file
150:15 - and i say export
150:18 - default right
150:21 - now what we just did is if i save this
150:23 - uh
150:24 - prettier's not going to do this the way
150:26 - i need it
150:27 - okay so what i'm going to do now is i'm
150:29 - actually going to basically
150:31 - take it to your printer in your computer
150:33 - save it there and bring it back
150:37 - genius that's good [ __ ] man
150:41 - i'm gonna do that save this
150:48 - [Music]
150:49 - nice that's smart okay so now what we're
150:52 - going to do is we have the tesla search
150:54 - right so you basically want to
150:56 - prettier guys if you install printer
150:58 - into your computer it will do that for
150:59 - you so you actually just make this into
151:01 - an object that you can use
151:02 - and then we say export default right
151:04 - export default and then that will allow
151:06 - us to use this response as a
151:07 - as an object right so now the reason why
151:09 - that's good
151:10 - is because what we can do is we can
151:12 - actually develop using that response so
151:14 - because you need to follow me again all
151:17 - right
151:19 - yeah so now if you if we go
151:22 - into a search page right so here is the
151:26 - live
151:26 - call right so this is our super powerful
151:29 - live
151:29 - course i'm going to say this is a live
151:31 - api call
151:32 - this one yeah and to make that super
151:34 - clear for you guys what i'm going to do
151:35 - is i'm going to chuck that above
151:37 - here like this that's the live api call
151:39 - this one yeah
151:40 - but we don't necessarily want to always
151:43 - do the live api call so
151:44 - what we can do is we can say cons data
151:46 - get the data from our response
151:48 - instead and our response could be from
151:50 - our local
151:51 - response file so this will actually go
151:54 - ahead and it's the exact same shape the
151:55 - exact same everything
151:57 - but it's just pulling it from this data
151:59 - instead so now
152:01 - um if i do console.log data so cause if
152:04 - we go to the search and we open the
152:08 - inspector
152:10 - i will open the inspector right now so
152:12 - boom
152:15 - okay now if we refresh and we open the
152:19 - console
152:21 - okay refresh
152:24 - yeah and now you should see we still get
152:28 - an object right but we're not
152:29 - pinging the the the google search term
152:31 - we're just getting that tesla search
152:33 - that you've done previously
152:34 - yeah so we basically this is like uh
152:37 - this is called um
152:39 - uh i can't remember it's called masking
152:41 - no it's not asking yes um
152:43 - yeah anyway it's got a name for it but
152:45 - basically what we're doing is we're
152:46 - mocking that's it we're mocking the api
152:48 - call
152:49 - right so now you can see that that
152:51 - search term so if you click that
152:52 - downward arrow kazi insert
152:54 - in the in the console there you go we've
152:56 - got we've got that exact same response
152:58 - so now what we can do is
153:00 - we we don't have to worry about using
153:02 - our quota up and what we can do is at
153:03 - the end of it we just can comment this
153:05 - out
153:05 - and uncomment the actual live one and
153:07 - it'll work right nice that's a very
153:10 - that's a nice little trick that you guys
153:11 - can do to sort of get around quotas and
153:14 - stuff like that because i know that can
153:15 - become quite a headache especially when
153:16 - you're developing
153:18 - all right so we now have the data from
153:20 - google we have the good stuff right
153:22 - so let's go ahead and make this all sort
153:25 - of pretty and look nice now so
153:27 - the search page header what we're going
153:29 - to do now is at the at the top of the
153:31 - page we're going to have a link
153:32 - and inside that link we're going to have
153:34 - a search page logo so i'm going to go
153:36 - ahead and save this
153:38 - so we have the link at the top and then
153:40 - we have an image this has
153:41 - a class name of search page logo and
153:43 - this is just the google logo
153:45 - right so link is not defined so we need
153:47 - to go ahead and import that from
153:48 - material
153:49 - from react group dom like this save that
153:53 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
153:54 - going to go ahead and go to
153:56 - searchpage.css
153:58 - and i'm going to do the following i'm
153:59 - going to say go and target the search
154:01 - page logo
154:03 - search page logo and apply the following
154:06 - to it so i'm going to go ahead and do
154:08 - this
154:09 - so i'm going to go ahead and give it uh
154:11 - contain height 50 margin right 50 pixels
154:14 - so that way whatever's next to it it's
154:15 - not going to touch it
154:17 - okay then what we're going to do is
154:19 - we're going to go back
154:20 - and we're going to carry on so we've got
154:22 - the link at the top so that's cool
154:24 - and we want the next part is i think
154:27 - there's something
154:27 - wrong with the google like the search
154:29 - engine
154:31 - what you made uh so josh patel actually
154:34 - said that he searched um
154:37 - find me a better duo than sonny and kazi
154:39 - and he goes it responded with the 404
154:41 - not found
154:44 - nice
154:45 - [Laughter]
154:50 - [Music]
154:52 - i was thinking i was like oh [ __ ] what
154:53 - happened
154:55 - nice that's awesome thanks bro thanks
155:00 - nice so now what we're going to do is
155:02 - and guys let's push the 2k likes
155:04 - come on give me that free lunch
155:08 - let's go so let's go and next what we're
155:11 - going to do next
155:12 - is inside the search page header i'm
155:14 - going to basically go ahead
155:15 - and add a div here
155:19 - and i'm going to do this
155:23 - so i'm going to add a div with search
155:24 - page header and i'm going to change this
155:26 - one to the header body right so this is
155:28 - where the search is going to be in a
155:29 - bunch of other things
155:30 - so remember we built the search out
155:32 - earlier so to get it working here
155:34 - very simple i literally just do this i
155:36 - say search hide the buttons i don't want
155:38 - the buttons in there
155:39 - so it's as simple as that and this is
155:41 - the power of react so we just coded that
155:43 - up earlier
155:43 - and boom i can push that in there and
155:46 - everything will
155:47 - work so let's go ahead and see why
155:49 - that's not working it's because i've
155:50 - done two dots
155:51 - and we don't have it in components we
155:52 - have inside search so i can go ahead and
155:54 - save that
155:55 - and now we can see that look at that we
155:57 - have the search bar at the top
155:59 - which is awesome right we have that
156:01 - working and then
156:03 - what we can do is we have a bunch of
156:06 - like options underneath it so first i'm
156:07 - going to go ahead and style some of this
156:08 - stuff so
156:09 - the actual header itself i'm going to
156:11 - give the following to it i'm going to
156:13 - say it's
156:13 - display flex position is sticky because
156:16 - when we scroll down
156:17 - i want it to basically stick i'm going
156:19 - to say top of zero so it's going to
156:21 - stick to the top
156:22 - background color white z index of 100 so
156:24 - that way when we're scrolling down it
156:26 - always stays at the top of the screen so
156:28 - it'll be on top of any elements
156:29 - underneath it align items flex start
156:32 - i'll show explain what that does in a
156:33 - sec padding of 30 pixels
156:35 - and border bottom of one pixel which is
156:37 - why we have that little gray
156:39 - uh border color because we might need to
156:40 - do a 50 50 split now
156:43 - um for the responsiveness because i
156:45 - didn't the search page is a little bit
156:47 - less responsive so
156:48 - um let's go ahead and i think we're
156:52 - muted camera when you said 50 50 split
156:55 - so
156:56 - got it okay you mean boom like that
156:59 - yeah let's do a 50 50 yep nice
157:04 - uh and then what we're gonna do now is
157:06 - go to
157:07 - so we have that yep nice so now what i'm
157:11 - gonna say is
157:12 - inside of the header body what we can
157:14 - actually do at this point is the search
157:16 - itself so that search box uh so the
157:19 - search input
157:20 - item and this is where bem comes in
157:21 - really handy what we can say is
157:23 - go inside the header body right so where
157:26 - we have our search so this one here
157:28 - go inside the header body where we have
157:30 - our search here and basically
157:32 - go and override those search styles so
157:35 - in search we had search and search input
157:38 - so go inside find that
157:39 - change the margin top to zero unset the
157:42 - width unset the margins that we applied
157:44 - before and unset the max width
157:47 - and what it does is it overrides the
157:48 - style right so it overrides the styles
157:50 - that we previously put on it
157:52 - which is kind of nice right so that
157:54 - means we can reuse it but we can
157:55 - actually
157:56 - just from our css go ahead and change
157:58 - the styling of that search box
158:00 - um so that's really clean and then
158:02 - underneath there we have a bunch of
158:04 - options so let's go ahead and check out
158:05 - the deployed version kazi
158:09 - let's go ahead and check out the
158:10 - deployed version yep so boom
158:14 - and then let's type in the search terms
158:16 - like abc
158:18 - is it going to take us to that page uh
158:21 - no because i'm using a mock
158:22 - i did i redeployed it with a mock so i
158:24 - got it we did it
158:28 - yep so now you can see at the top of the
158:31 - page
158:31 - we've got uh where it says all news
158:33 - instagram
158:34 - images shopping maps and et cetera those
158:37 - things those are the options
158:39 - right so we're going to refer to those
158:40 - as like options okay
158:42 - so now what we're going to do so hold on
158:45 - let me just draw that out
158:47 - let me draw that out what you just said
158:49 - and just dropped a huge donation dude
158:52 - whoa that is

159:37 - soon i'm
159:38 - pumped yeah oh my god thank you
159:41 - yeah um so now we have the header
159:45 - um the header body wait wait wait wait
159:48 - wait wait
159:48 - before we do that so we were gonna try
159:51 - this so when we go to search
159:52 - what were you saying we're gonna work on
159:54 - oh yeah so we're working on those
159:56 - um search page uh options
160:00 - so they're all news images shopping maps
160:02 - okay let me just draw that out it's very
160:04 - clear so okay so
160:07 - uh what about tools and settings uh yeah
160:11 - so all of that
160:12 - comes under the uh the uh
160:15 - options basically search page options
160:17 - yeah all right so this is going to be
160:19 - search page
160:20 - options okay is there any reason why
160:23 - it's called
160:23 - options yeah it's just when you're
160:26 - coding like this really quick in the
160:28 - library the namings
160:29 - the names always get a bit of a headache
160:31 - so in this case i just called it an
160:33 - option
160:34 - got it okay okay no worries no worries i
160:35 - understand now so
160:37 - yeah perfect okay i think that's pretty
160:39 - good so basically should we write
160:41 - working on the
160:45 - things under the search for our search
160:46 - page options working on search page
160:48 - options yeah
160:49 - working on the let's just maybe working
160:52 - on the search page because this is
160:54 - literally going to be building out the
160:55 - search page
160:56 - well that's what i'm yeah i have at the
160:58 - top working on bill search
161:00 - results page so this one we could do we
161:01 - could do uh building the search page
161:03 - options yeah
161:05 - okay cool building items
161:09 - yeah build items under yeah
161:13 - search bar i like that
161:16 - yeah i just like it when it's just plain
161:18 - english and i think like
161:19 - even developers right if you're writing
161:22 - commit messages
161:22 - it's better to just write plain english
161:25 - yeah
161:26 - exactly it's very true all right cool so
161:29 - this is looking good
161:32 - awesome so you want me to just go to the
161:35 - search page yeah and then just stay
161:37 - there
161:38 - yeah so go to the search page and
161:41 - remember guys we are actually
161:42 - mocking the response so we will see like
161:44 - uh once we start coding up it will just
161:46 - be pulling that mock tesla response
161:48 - so now and guys i saw a question earlier
161:51 - are we
161:52 - pulling from the google uh custom search
161:54 - api yes this is coming from google so
161:56 - it's going to be
161:57 - a complete build so with that said
162:00 - next what we're going to do is we're
162:01 - going to say div so div
162:04 - it's going to be class name equals
162:07 - search page options search page options
162:10 - like this right and this is going to be
162:13 - a container which can
162:14 - hold all of that stuff together right so
162:17 - now what we're going to do is i'm going
162:19 - to say
162:20 - um so i'm going to say dev search page
162:22 - options
162:23 - nice wait one sec what's going on here
162:29 - wait has it gone out of sync again i
162:30 - think it has
162:32 - mine looks super weird compared to yours
162:35 - let me go ahead and close that search
162:38 - page
162:41 - search page results wait i didn't like
162:44 - that
162:47 - oh yeah that was underneath right that
162:49 - was underneath
162:52 - this is the divs yeah oh dude it's
162:55 - because of that
162:56 - it's an annoying thing you know when it
162:58 - adds the extra closing tag
163:01 - yeah yeah yeah i don't know why it does
163:03 - that i don't understand super annoying
163:05 - yeah yeah right so now we've got the
163:08 - search page options
163:09 - so here i'm going to write oh thank you
163:11 - very much phenom just dropped a donation
163:13 - awesome dude he goes do you make android
163:15 - apps too we're we're going to be
163:16 - dropping react native
163:18 - soon so that that will actually be both
163:20 - ios and android
163:22 - yep so now what we're going to have is
163:25 - i'm going to split this into two
163:26 - containers i'm going to have options
163:28 - left and options right
163:30 - all right so options left is going to be
163:32 - inside of this container so it's going
163:34 - to
163:34 - div like this and then i'm going to have
163:36 - another one options right
163:38 - and options right is going to have the
163:39 - stuff on the right hand side options
163:41 - left is going to have the stuff on the
163:43 - left hand side so with that said
163:46 - let's go ahead and start pushing in the
163:48 - thing so every single option
163:50 - i'm going to make it easier for us later
163:52 - on frank just dropped another
163:54 - bite oh my god he just
163:57 - sent you both some ubereats credits nice
164:01 - nice i'm gonna order uber eats today
164:05 - thank you frank yeah thank you so much
164:08 - dude
164:09 - he goes thanks for all the work you do
164:10 - treat yourself yep
164:12 - i will and i'm now trying to um get back
164:15 - to my fitness
164:16 - fitness grind frank so i gotta be eating
164:19 - clean you know
164:20 - you know how clean stuff gets expensive
164:22 - so i can use those credits
164:25 - that's insane thank you dude
164:28 - so now what we're gonna do is we have
164:30 - options left
164:31 - so every single option i'm going to put
164:33 - inside of a container called
164:35 - search page option right so i know we're
164:37 - getting a bit nested here but
164:39 - it will make life a lot easier right so
164:41 - the first one
164:42 - i'm going to have a search icon and a
164:44 - link so we're using a react router link
164:46 - search i got a link to all and the
164:48 - option is just going to be all okay
164:50 - so i'm going to go ahead and import that
164:51 - here and you guys will see an example of
164:53 - what that looks like so let's go ahead
164:55 - and drop that in
164:56 - and also we need link from reactor or
164:58 - dom so let's go ahead and pull that we
164:59 - we are
165:00 - we do have that already so you can see
165:01 - it says all
165:03 - right so we have it there and i'm going
165:04 - to go ahead and copy a snippet now so
165:07 - i'm just going to keep the screen to the
165:09 - third
165:10 - just because i want everybody able to
165:11 - see the code i think people understand
165:13 - that this
165:14 - part might not be completely mobile
165:15 - responsive but once it goes
165:17 - full but neither is google but this is
165:20 - still more responsive than google so
165:21 - it's fine i think
165:22 - people will get that now yeah one thing
165:25 - i was gonna say was
165:26 - once you do want me to switch to it
165:28 - being bigger screen just
165:30 - in case there's something we need to
165:31 - show then let me know and i'll do that
165:33 - so nice damn we're at 198 we're two
165:36 - dollars away from hitting the 200
165:38 - donation goal we've never hit that so
165:40 - that is epic
165:42 - thank you guys that's insane
165:45 - nice so we added the search icon and
165:48 - this link so
165:50 - i basically added a bunch more here so
165:52 - this is what i've gone ahead and added a
165:54 - snippet from our code
165:56 - um so you can see here right here we
165:58 - have the rest of the the stuff here so
165:59 - you've got
166:00 - all of these icons description image
166:02 - local offer
166:03 - room and more vertical and i'll show you
166:05 - what each one comes out to be
166:07 - and this one is the news image shopping
166:09 - maps and more
166:10 - all right so let's go ahead and make the
166:11 - appropriate imports
166:13 - so let's go ahead and do the imports at
166:15 - the top
166:16 - so here you go save that file and now
166:20 - we'll see that those icons should be
166:22 - there alongside
166:23 - the uh the text right so that looks
166:25 - pretty good
166:27 - right so we have all that stuff um
166:30 - and then what we can do is we have
166:32 - options right so options right we're
166:34 - gonna have the same thing but we don't
166:36 - have the icons in this case so
166:38 - and so what i'm going to do here is drop
166:40 - it in
166:41 - like this and this internet so we've got
166:45 - the search page option but this one's
166:47 - just going to have a link sync settings
166:48 - and this one's just to have tools it
166:49 - doesn't have like an icon like these
166:50 - ones
166:51 - okay so i'm going to save that as well
166:53 - and you can see right now the layout is
166:54 - pretty crap it just looks like it just
166:56 - sits on top of everything right so i'm
166:59 - going to go ahead and start styling at
167:01 - this point before it gets a bit too
167:02 - crazy
167:03 - so i'm going to say for the options so
167:05 - for all of the options
167:06 - let's go ahead and apply the following
167:08 - display flex align the item center and
167:10 - make the color gray
167:11 - so if i do that you can see header
167:14 - options left and options right get
167:17 - pushed
167:18 - side by side because now it's in a row
167:20 - right so that's the first reason
167:23 - then what i'm going to say is for both
167:26 - for both
167:27 - options right and options left do
167:29 - display flex so that's why you can see
167:31 - now that everything goes into that
167:33 - into a row right so that's really clean
167:36 - then i'm going to say
167:37 - for the options anchor tags
167:40 - and for the options right anchor tags so
167:43 - for everything basically
167:44 - all of the anchor tags change the text
167:46 - decoration to none and the color to gray
167:48 - and that means it gets rid of that link
167:50 - look and feel so we don't want that link
167:52 - fill right
167:53 - and then i'm going to have options right
167:56 - so i'm going to target options right and
167:57 - i'm going to say
167:58 - it shouldn't touch right now settings is
168:00 - right next to that more icon
168:02 - it shouldn't touch if we want a margin
168:03 - left of 80 pixels so
168:06 - kazia's make it full screen i'll make it
168:08 - uh let's do the
168:09 - let's do half and half just for this
168:11 - point
168:15 - there we go so half and half just for
168:16 - this point and then we're good yep
168:18 - so here we have that and then what i'm
168:21 - going to do
168:22 - is i'm going to say for the
168:25 - option itself i'm going to say display
168:28 - flex and a line item center with a
168:30 - margin right of 20 pixels
168:32 - so this should get all of the icons
168:34 - centered centered with the text and it
168:36 - will give a margin right of 20 pixels
168:38 - which will space it out
168:40 - right so there we go see the sign
168:42 - already starts to look a lot cleaner
168:43 - yeah now we're going to say
168:45 - for the anchor tags inside of those
168:47 - options so for those links
168:48 - given that it's looking really clean
168:50 - look at that
168:52 - yeah so for margin uh left so give a
168:55 - margin left to that anchor tag so that
168:57 - they're sort of all
168:58 - news images shops and maps etc give that
169:01 - a five pixel margin let's say it pushes
169:03 - itself away
169:04 - a little bit from that text and with
169:06 - that guys
169:07 - that's pretty much that done so that's
169:08 - pretty nice and they're actually
169:10 - clickable links which take you to
169:11 - forward slash all four sessions
169:12 - news etc so um you can go ahead and
169:16 - build out those pages if you want to do
169:18 - that right
169:19 - um so that's cool so we've actually got
169:21 - the the options part
169:22 - finished so now we've got the final part
169:25 - which is the search page results
169:27 - so let's update the top bar because it
169:29 - is a final page
169:31 - building the search page results
169:34 - all right
169:38 - and this is where the nice last bit of
169:40 - magic happens
169:42 - hey so we're finished that part let's

170:57 - already and it's using express and other
170:59 - things nice i love that dude
171:02 - yeah 100 we could do that that would be
171:04 - fun
171:06 - yeah all right so travel zayn says
171:10 - wow it's so scary
171:13 - how real it looks compared to the actual
171:16 - one
171:16 - beautiful work kazzy and sunny we love
171:18 - you he's talking about how
171:20 - similar this looks to actual google yeah
171:23 - it's insane i actually got confused i
171:24 - was telling kazi before we went live oh
171:26 - yeah
171:26 - i actually got confused a bunch of times
171:28 - because i was googling stuff and i was
171:29 - like oh hang on
171:30 - i'm using localhost yeah it has a phenom
171:33 - says
171:34 - i'm my android developer here but you
171:36 - guys are op
171:37 - hell yeah nice thank you bro thank you
171:39 - so much
171:41 - and guys all we ask is if you're
171:42 - enjoying the video and you haven't
171:43 - already done so
171:44 - just please smash the thumbs up button
171:46 - and it will just help the video get out
171:48 - to as many people
171:49 - so that so many that that extra person
171:51 - would just get that value from this
171:52 - video
171:54 - yep dope nice all right let's keep this
171:56 - bad boy going
171:58 - so now what we're going to do is we're
171:59 - going to say we only want to render so
172:01 - we're going to put a protective block
172:02 - and we're going to
172:03 - only render that the search results if
172:06 - you provided a search term so we're
172:08 - actually protecting ourselves here
172:10 - uh by doing this so we're saying do that
172:13 - right and because
172:14 - at this point we can actually do a
172:15 - quarter or we could do we could do a
172:17 - half half split maybe
172:19 - i think that would be good
172:25 - yep so half off skin now what we're
172:28 - going to do here is
172:29 - we have um
172:32 - so yeah so we have the research page
172:36 - results
172:36 - so the first thing we're going to do is
172:38 - the result count right so where it says
172:40 - about 5 million results or however how
172:42 - the hell google do that i don't know
172:44 - but basically we're going to put that at
172:46 - the top so we're going to do that
172:47 - first we're going to say search page
172:49 - result count and here
172:51 - we say about so something like this
172:54 - about three million results or something
172:57 - yeah remember the results and then it's
172:59 - got brackets
173:02 - and saying something seconds would be
173:03 - like 0.3 seconds or something
173:06 - and then it will say four and then it'll
173:08 - say whatever search term you put in so
173:10 - it'll be like for tesla for example
173:12 - right
173:12 - so if we save this and we refresh the
173:16 - search page
173:20 - so this refresh to search it boom
173:25 - so now we should see underneath uh oh
173:28 - tom wasn't biased yeah so here i'm going
173:30 - to just say
173:31 - i'm just going to replace this with true
173:32 - for now and then we'll put that in at
173:34 - the end
173:37 - yeah so you see it says about 3 million
173:39 - seconds or something 0.3
173:41 - seconds for tesla right so i want to
173:43 - actually pull this from the information
173:44 - so
173:45 - this information is actually coming in
173:48 - from that response and i've actually
173:50 - done the hard work of diving into that
173:52 - object for you guys
173:53 - and this is what you need to type in so
173:55 - data and this and we put the optional
173:57 - trainings because data might be no for a
174:00 - little bit while it's fetching
174:01 - right and then what we're going to do is
174:03 - we're going to say search information so
174:05 - it gives us back a search information
174:06 - object
174:07 - and then it gives us back something
174:08 - called formatted total results
174:10 - so if we save this now you see it's
174:12 - actually 266 million that came from
174:14 - directly from the results right
174:18 - the next one we're going to do is for
174:20 - the seconds so for seconds we can go
174:22 - ahead and replace this
174:24 - with the seconds and let me go ahead and
174:26 - just do this
174:27 - so we've got data search information
174:29 - formatted search time
174:31 - so we need to refresh the search
174:35 - um i don't know why it doesn't do that
174:38 - yeah hey guys
174:39 - i got a quick i got a quick question i
174:41 - want us i want to just ask
174:43 - this to everybody um i want to see if
174:46 - our twitch has finally started working
174:48 - properly
174:49 - because our twitch kept being broken so
174:51 - i dropped the link in the chat
174:54 - and um if you guys want to check out our
174:56 - twitch it's
174:58 - right here whoa what's happening
175:02 - so let me bring that it's right here
175:05 - it's a twitch.tv clever programmer
175:09 - this is the url so if you guys can just
175:11 - go and take a look at that and just see
175:13 - if that's working properly and having
175:15 - weird feedback or issues because that'd
175:17 - be huge because we want to grow
175:19 - on twitch and we were having trouble
175:21 - last time because
175:22 - our stream just kept giving us tons of
175:24 - errors
175:26 - yeah that'd be massively useful guys
175:31 - nice so let's
175:34 - go ahead so we saw we were pulling the
175:36 - information we had data search
175:37 - information formatted search time
175:40 - there we go and now what we're going to
175:42 - do is we're also going to say
175:43 - 4 and rather than here doing tesla we're
175:46 - going to say term
175:48 - right so whatever the search term was
175:49 - and what we can do is we can replace
175:51 - term here and i can actually go up and
175:52 - protect um
175:53 - i can actually just say term equals by
175:55 - default let's just do tesla
175:57 - right so if you don't pass in the time
175:59 - we we protect him we say oh passing
176:00 - tesla
176:02 - uh that should work yeah so now if we
176:04 - refresh cozy i think i don't know why
176:06 - it doesn't it's not doing the refreshing
176:08 - in a nice way but we're gonna have to
176:10 - refresh identity
176:12 - oh we did right okay so this doesn't
176:14 - work this protection thing
176:16 - so i'm just gonna say true here and it
176:18 - will say
176:19 - four and it'll be blank right so let's
176:20 - go ahead and do this and i'll say four
176:22 - blank but that's fine because
176:24 - it will be mapped to the term right
176:27 - so at this point what we can do is we
176:29 - want to basically map through all the
176:31 - items remember we got like a list of
176:33 - items back right
176:34 - so here what i'm going to do is i'm
176:36 - going to say uh we want to map through
176:38 - all of them
176:39 - right so i'm going to say here um
176:42 - i'm going to say data remember optional
176:45 - training so it doesn't sort of crash
176:47 - itself or whatever
176:48 - say optional data dot items
176:52 - data.items.map and we'll say each item
176:55 - should get rendered out in the following
176:57 - way so i'm going to basically give each
176:58 - item a div
177:00 - right and that div let's do a closing
177:03 - all right so each item has a div and
177:05 - it's a class name and that class name
177:08 - is going to have search page results
177:09 - like this
177:11 - search page results okay now inside of
177:13 - that class uh inside of that result
177:15 - we're going to have an anchor right so
177:17 - an anchor tag
177:18 - and this anchor tag is going to have a
177:21 - few things right so it's going to say
177:24 - it's going to have the display link
177:25 - mainly right so firstly what we're going
177:27 - to do is we're going to say
177:29 - the item itself has a display link right
177:33 - and then it has this little carrot next
177:34 - to it so let's go ahead and do that
177:37 - and now you can see so guys you can you
177:39 - see it says um oh oops
177:41 - it says tesla tesla the band tesla.com
177:45 - wikipedia tesla shop.tesla yep i see it
177:49 - yes it's really cool this part like as
177:51 - you start to see everything pop in
177:52 - and then the next one is going to be an
177:55 - oh so that should have been an anchor
177:56 - tag sorry that should have been inside
177:57 - of an anchor tag so anchor
177:59 - like this and then this line of code
178:02 - should have gone in here
178:03 - and then the href so where does this
178:06 - anchor tag go to what's the link
178:08 - we say href equals and this is going to
178:10 - be item
178:12 - dot link right so that's where the link
178:15 - comes from
178:15 - so if we go ahead and we can save that
178:18 - and now you can see all of those are
178:20 - active links uh
178:22 - and then what we're gonna do is oh
178:23 - ingrid carson enrolled angry
178:25 - if that was a viewer let us know if you
178:27 - joined
178:29 - nice yeah that's epic ingrid carlson
178:32 - just joined
178:32 - profit with javascript welcome to the
178:35 - course
178:36 - yeah paul bento said landed a job by
178:39 - watching your videos and i'm so pumped
178:40 - to be here that's insane dude
178:42 - damn that is a beautiful comment
178:46 - yeah that's really nice uh let's see
178:50 - yep landed a job by watching your videos
178:52 - i'm so pumped to be here
178:53 - welcome paul and thank you for sharing
178:56 - that
178:56 - as another developer ding ding
179:01 - [Music]
179:03 - awesome so now what we're going to do is
179:05 - we have data items
179:07 - then we have another anchor tag and
179:09 - thank you guys for checking twitch i
179:10 - know joe
179:11 - diaz and everybody went and checked
179:13 - lauren and swann and checked and teja
179:15 - says it's okay so thank you guys for
179:16 - that
179:18 - yeah thank you guys so now if we go
179:20 - ahead and do
179:21 - this so an anchor tag here and what this
179:24 - one's gonna be for the result title so
179:26 - i'm giving it a class name a result out
179:27 - that link is going to be the same so
179:29 - it's hf to the item link
179:30 - because a few things are clickable right
179:32 - then here we're going to have a h2
179:34 - which has the item dot title so now
179:37 - once it says and it should save in a sec
179:41 - we'll see the actual text come as in the
179:43 - actual titles come in so you can see
179:44 - model three
179:45 - tesla the band has their incorporated
179:47 - model s all of these things right
179:51 - so that's really clean and really nice
179:52 - and then the last thing for this is we
179:54 - want to snip it
179:55 - so p tag sort of p tag
179:58 - which uh has a class name of result
180:01 - snippet so this is actually something
180:02 - pretty cool
180:03 - uh the google api provides a snippet
180:06 - back and basically what it does is
180:08 - they'll have some information like a
180:09 - description or something and they'll
180:11 - actually go ahead and it'll truncate it
180:12 - so i have
180:13 - dot dot if it's too big right so item
180:16 - dot snippet
180:17 - here so now if i save this now what we
180:20 - can see
180:24 - yes because i think you need to refresh
180:28 - okay so i'm gonna go ahead and boom do
180:31 - it
180:35 - yep so now you can see we've got the
180:37 - actual uh p
180:38 - tag so the actual description so you see
180:41 - this is all coming from that search term
180:43 - so it's really really nice
180:45 - and now the beautiful thing is that
180:46 - we've actually written a lot of what we
180:48 - need
180:48 - and we can actually go ahead and start
180:50 - styling this to make it look like the
180:52 - final product
180:53 - right so the first thing is we're going
180:55 - to do is we're going to make the result
180:56 - itself
180:57 - so the div which is actually each of
180:59 - those results so this one right here
181:01 - we're going to go ahead and style this
181:03 - and say make it have a margin 40 pixels
181:06 - and
181:06 - uh so forty pixels top and bottom and
181:08 - zero on left and right oh and tejas just
181:10 - dropped another donation he said keep it
181:12 - up guys
181:13 - stream is lit since i found this channel
181:15 - in recommendation i watched almost every
181:16 - video
181:17 - um everything is perfect except
181:20 - management hiding channel 4 is no reason
181:22 - good night
181:23 - that's great wow thank you tank thank
181:26 - you there's
181:27 - he's like stream is lit and this is
181:29 - amazing because he might have
181:31 - yes we broke 200.
181:35 - let's go wow
181:39 - thank you you guys we really really
181:41 - appreciate it
181:42 - that is awesome thank you yeah huge
181:47 - wow that's a mile that's a milestone
181:48 - that's our first honey
181:50 - yeah 200 dude insane wow
181:53 - we should invest it into um doing
181:56 - giveaways for everybody for shirts
181:58 - yeah that'll be insane let me show you
182:01 - some merch
182:03 - that'd be cool so now what we're going
182:05 - to have
182:06 - is we have the result link yeah so the
182:09 - result count
182:10 - is next so i'm going to change it so it
182:12 - says
182:13 - search page result count and this one
182:16 - you can see
182:16 - the result count now became this little
182:18 - gray so that's kind of cool
182:20 - and then what we're going to do is we're
182:23 - going to say
182:24 - the results so the actual container
182:27 - holding all of the results
182:29 - is going to say we're going to say max
182:31 - width of 650 pixels
182:33 - margin top is 20 pixels margin left of
182:35 - 240 pixels
182:37 - and a margin bottom of 100 so you see
182:39 - what it will do is it will pull
182:40 - everything in
182:41 - so that's how google do it they pull
182:43 - everything in and
182:45 - yeah that's awesome maybe there's 300
182:47 - more likes and sunny gets dinner on me
182:50 - i'm thinking oh don't don't worry
182:51 - maribon i think frank's already got the
182:53 - dinner
182:54 - i think i'm good i think we're good
182:56 - let's go
182:59 - frank actually yeah thanks frank gaming
183:01 - clutch with the
183:02 - the uber we got that we got the google
183:04 - credits
183:05 - that's insane nice so
183:09 - uh now we have the results styled
183:13 - um uh yeah so now what we're gonna do is
183:16 - for the result title
183:18 - so you can see the result title we have
183:21 - um text decoration none so as soon as i
183:24 - add that you'll see the underline goes
183:26 - right so that's cool but we want to keep
183:28 - the hovering
183:29 - so we want it to when you hover over it
183:31 - we want to underline it so if i do this
183:33 - then what we do is it says
183:37 - so now when we when we hover over it it
183:39 - will be
183:40 - a case of it will basically show you an
183:44 - underline right so that's really nice
183:45 - and then what we're going to do is we're
183:46 - going to target the h2
183:48 - we're going to target the h2
183:51 - and then we're going to do this and it
183:53 - says the font weight
183:55 - will change now so it becomes less bold
183:57 - so that's really clean at the end
183:59 - and then the final thing is the results
184:01 - snippet so that description is too close
184:03 - to
184:03 - the actual text so let's give it a
184:05 - margin 10 pixel
184:07 - away from it right so this is awesome
184:09 - it's looking
184:10 - really really clean and it's looking
184:13 - really really nice right
184:15 - so what we're going to do now is we're
184:17 - going to actually add a
184:18 - sort of um we're going to actually add
184:20 - an image
184:21 - to some of the values so some of these
184:24 - uh search page results actually return
184:26 - a really nice sort of image right so
184:29 - what we're gonna do here
184:30 - is and this is like a finishing touch on
184:32 - this right we're gonna go ahead
184:34 - over to the anchor tag over here
184:38 - all right i really like this message i
184:39 - want to give this a shout out the
184:41 - greatest ever says
184:42 - he goes sunny man whoops let me actually
184:45 - remove this he goes this is some amazing
184:47 - stuff
184:48 - qazi thanks for the platform as well
184:50 - every time i think about how i have been
184:52 - able to apply these lessons i get super
184:55 - grateful and almost teary
184:56 - thank you fam that's insane i love that
185:00 - dude
185:01 - that's insane i love seeing like when
185:03 - you actually see that people
185:05 - are really really like watching and even
185:07 - the donations like holy crap i remember
185:09 - when me and kazi started we got
185:10 - four dollars i think it was in the
185:12 - donation and we were like whoa
185:14 - yeah we lost our minds for because that
185:16 - was the most that we've
185:18 - ever done i was like yeah damn bro
185:23 - exactly all right so now
185:27 - what we're gonna do is we have
185:31 - the final thing so that that image right
185:33 - so that image that we were talking about
185:34 - so
185:35 - what we need to do is here i need to
185:36 - actually provide a check so i'm going to
185:38 - say
185:39 - uh inside of this a tag so i actually
185:41 - have it next to the a tag
185:43 - i'm going to say here so i'm going to
185:46 - add this
185:46 - right so i'm going to say if so this is
185:49 - actually where the image is located is
185:51 - strange
185:51 - it's weird i'm not sure what this all
185:53 - stands for but it's page maps yes the
185:55 - image.length
185:56 - i'm saying if there is an image in there
185:58 - right so if the length of that is
185:59 - longer than zero then go and access the
186:02 - source
186:03 - so then go ahead and go and access the
186:05 - source right
186:06 - and render the following so this is a
186:08 - bit of a messy bit of code but it will
186:10 - work
186:10 - and then what we're going to say is
186:11 - render an image like this
186:14 - where i say render the following image
186:16 - this image is a search page it has a
186:18 - search bar
186:19 - it says search page result image and the
186:21 - source
186:22 - is again that what we wrote earlier
186:25 - right so we don't actually need this one
186:27 - we can just use this
186:29 - and it will work awesome like that
186:33 - and now what we can do is we can go
186:34 - ahead and it says passing error line 87.
186:38 - let's go ahead and see why that's
186:40 - happening we see
186:42 - this we see this let's save it item
186:47 - all right double check what is happening
186:50 - so the anchor tag i'm going to go ahead
186:51 - and copy this in a bit
186:54 - replace this there we go nice
186:58 - so with that said i'm gonna go ahead and
187:00 - do a final finishing touch
187:02 - and i'm gonna copy this class name
187:06 - and basically style it with the
187:08 - following
187:09 - so i'm going to say for that image i'm
187:11 - going to do object fit contain
187:13 - height at 20 pixels width of 20 pixels
187:15 - and a margin right of 10 pixels so you
187:17 - notice how on the google
187:18 - on the actual app now because you check
187:21 - out it actually renders out like a
187:22 - little thumbnail it was meant to be a
187:24 - thumbnail
187:25 - if you scroll down they've all got like
187:27 - this sort of this look like these sort
187:28 - of images right
187:30 - so i'm going to add some rules to it so
187:32 - i'm going to say object fit
187:34 - height and width of 20 pixels and margin
187:35 - might have 10 pixels
187:37 - and then we do that and we get this nice
187:40 - little finishing touch
187:42 - so check that out
187:45 - so it adds that little image next to
187:47 - these oh yes
187:49 - i like that yeah that little clean image
187:52 - yep
187:53 - yep now to finish it we go back to our
187:56 - code change this
187:57 - back to term we go back to our mock
188:00 - and we take it away from the mock so
188:02 - this one was the mock api call so this
188:03 - one was the mock api call
188:07 - and we basically undo and we keep the
188:09 - live api call
188:10 - all right let me save it and now

188:16 - button firstly
