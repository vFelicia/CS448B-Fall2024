00:00 - z from cleverprogrammer.com in this
00:02 - video you are going to learn about the
00:04 - top four
00:05 - dying programming languages in 2020
00:09 - that's what we're going to be covering
00:11 - in this video i hope that
00:13 - you are excited because i sure am
00:17 - and some of these languages might
00:19 - actually surprise you
00:21 - with that said i do want to let you know
00:24 - that if you
00:25 - want to become a developer and you want
00:28 - to learn
00:28 - the best programming languages and also
00:31 - you want to be able to get a job or make
00:34 - an income as a developer
00:35 - i have put together an epic one hour
00:38 - free training
00:39 - with javascript the link is in the
00:42 - description below go ahead and sign up
00:45 - for it
00:45 - register for it and go watch that
00:47 - training it's going to blow your
00:48 - freaking mind
00:49 - all right completely free doesn't cost
00:51 - you anything with that said if you are
00:53 - excited
00:54 - smash that like button and let's jump
00:57 - right into
00:58 - it so what do we got here these are the
01:01 - programming languages and we got a
01:03 - couple of people doing a dance
01:05 - over these languages and this is based
01:08 - on
01:08 - real world stats and just a quick
01:10 - disclaimer as well guys
01:12 - this video is for fun this video is for
01:15 - shits and giggles and for us just to
01:17 - have a fireside chat
01:19 - have fun and don't take it too seriously
01:22 - because all the languages that i
01:24 - mentioned here that are
01:25 - dying there's still jobs out there for
01:28 - them
01:29 - there's still people paying for them so
01:31 - it's not
01:32 - like if you learn them you would never
01:34 - be able to get a job you see what i'm
01:36 - saying
01:36 - but they are based on statistically the
01:38 - programming languages
01:40 - that are a little bit lower and kind of
01:42 - dying
01:43 - so i'm going to keep going now this is
01:45 - based on real data according to google
01:47 - trends
01:47 - pipel which is the popularity of a
01:49 - programming language stack overflow and
01:51 - youtube as well we're going to be
01:52 - looking at so those four things we're
01:54 - going to look at
01:55 - ready three two one let's go now
01:59 - number four i hope you're excited for it
02:01 - is haskell
02:03 - and this haskell programming language is
02:05 - essentially a
02:06 - very functional programming language but
02:08 - it's also very very difficult to learn
02:11 - and difficult to understand if you see
02:14 - over here according to pipel
02:16 - it's currently in place number 27
02:20 - and pipel takes a lot of different
02:22 - things
02:23 - into its uh equation when it's figuring
02:26 - out like which
02:27 - programming language is popular or which
02:29 - one is kind of losing
02:30 - interest so it will look at things like
02:32 - how many google searches
02:34 - are being taken place for this how many
02:36 - answers
02:37 - are there available for this in the
02:39 - community how active the community is so
02:41 - for haskell
02:42 - it's kind of going down this is one of
02:45 - the programming languages
02:46 - that is dying now if you look at the
02:49 - trend over here
02:51 - over the last five years you can see
02:54 - that
02:54 - we have haskell and haskell is in blue
02:57 - and it's so low that you can't even see
02:59 - it it's like boom all the way at the
03:01 - bottom whereas
03:02 - popular programming languages like
03:03 - python and javascript
03:05 - you can see they are growing and they're
03:07 - continuously going up and
03:09 - up and up and python is actually even
03:11 - becoming more popular
03:12 - but that's a thing for another video
03:15 - but here hascal is in blue and you can
03:18 - see it's barely even
03:19 - visible it's not dying it was never
03:22 - alive that was just something funny we
03:24 - thought we would share with you
03:25 - and the slides a lot of these slides are
03:27 - actually prepared by amana so
03:29 - shout out to amanoth thank you so much
03:31 - for putting this together
03:33 - really really appreciate you let me go
03:37 - and go forward
03:40 - so i'm pumped that you guys are here
03:42 - katan
03:43 - paradox appreciate you guys all being
03:45 - here i know manat is here
03:47 - all right let's keep going so here you
03:49 - can see haskell is actually a dreaded
03:51 - programming language even
03:53 - according to stack overflow 2020 survey
03:56 - and they surveyed all their developers
03:57 - and they're like hey what's the
03:59 - what are the most dreaded programming
04:00 - languages for you and you guys can see
04:02 - the names of the ones here
04:04 - and here is haskell and it's one of the
04:06 - most dreaded ones at 48.3 percent
04:10 - and also another thing i recommend you
04:11 - do when you're trying to get a grasp of
04:14 - how popular programming language is
04:16 - look just go on youtube and look up
04:20 - tutorials for it are there active
04:21 - tutorials for it that were that are
04:23 - currently be playing
04:24 - uh being placed recently if there are
04:27 - that also kind of shows you how
04:29 - active that programming language is or
04:31 - how much support there is for it
04:32 - that's just one of the metrics along
04:34 - with you looking on stack overflow and
04:36 - many other places
04:37 - that's one of the ones i recommend and
04:38 - here the most recent stuff is actually a
04:41 - very very long time ago like seven years
04:42 - ago five years ago
04:44 - so my thoughts and prayers go out to
04:47 - ascal and hopefully so do yours
04:49 - if you guys are enjoying this so far
04:51 - boom go ahead
04:52 - and smash that like button break that
04:54 - goddamn thing and smash that subscribe
04:56 - button
04:57 - because we're trying to become we
04:59 - currently are actually the number one
05:01 - fastest growing coding channel on the
05:03 - planet thanks to you
05:05 - thanks to you who's watching this so
05:07 - really really appreciate you guys
05:09 - and we're putting out this content even
05:11 - frankie sitting right behind me
05:12 - helping out with all the content all the
05:14 - live so we put
05:16 - in the goddamn work for you guys and you
05:18 - can help us out so much just by hitting
05:20 - that

05:28 - because we want to keep it going we have
05:29 - over 400 viewers
05:30 - welcome and let's keep on rocking and
05:32 - rolling number three are you ready
05:36 - here we come for number three
05:38 - programming language that
05:39 - is dying it is
05:43 - pearl my friend so pearl is one of those
05:46 - languages that
05:47 - is on the decline if we look over here
05:50 - it's on position 22 in the pipal index
05:53 - it's
05:54 - going down in popularity it also means
05:56 - going down and a lot of the support
05:58 - around that community
06:00 - again disclaimer so they're not a lot of
06:02 - those people in the comments
06:04 - being really upset really hurt if you're
06:07 - learning this
06:08 - there's still jobs out there for it
06:10 - there's still people i promise that are
06:12 - willing to pay you for it
06:14 - it's just not as popular it's just
06:16 - declining okay so
06:18 - don't take it so seriously to your heart
06:20 - all right we're just having fun
06:21 - but pearl is one of the programming
06:23 - languages that's dying
06:25 - take a look over here comparative python
06:27 - and javascript which are flying here
06:29 - you'll see pearl and boom it's all the
06:31 - way low all right
06:32 - and you can see the decline happening
06:34 - right if i if you follow my red marker
06:36 - you see it's declining declining decline
06:39 - into non-existence and if i actually
06:41 - hide my face over here you'll really
06:43 - really see it what's up guys welcome
06:44 - welcome you have 460 people live on this
06:47 - damn thing
06:48 - so pumped to have all of you guys here
06:50 - fizzer says
06:51 - damn i don't even know pearl that's all
06:54 - good
06:55 - you can look it up online uh ready dev
06:58 - says
06:59 - clever programmers growing freaking
07:00 - faster than traversing media and free
07:02 - code cam yo we're growing faster than
07:03 - free code camp
07:06 - damn i totally forgot about looking at
07:09 - free code cam when i was doing that i
07:10 - saw we were growing faster than
07:11 - traversing media
07:12 - but we're growing faster than free code
07:14 - count let's get it
07:16 - the best coding channel on the planet
07:18 - and it's all thanks to you
07:20 - for being here and making it so so with
07:22 - that said
07:23 - let's keep on rocking and rolling you
07:25 - can see pearl here is
07:27 - let me remove this white board you can
07:29 - see pearl over here is a dreaded
07:31 - programming language
07:32 - um you know according to the stack
07:34 - overflow index 71
07:37 - of developers actually dread it that is
07:39 - pretty damn crazy
07:41 - so pearl is definitely one to avoid
07:44 - if you're trying to figure out what
07:46 - programming language to learn don't
07:47 - learn this
07:49 - and here are some tutorials for it that
07:50 - were made a while ago right four years
07:53 - ago
07:53 - that's a long long time ago now
07:57 - pearl uh it's a declining and it's gonna
08:00 - still take a long time to kind of
08:02 - flatten out you guys saw it was like
08:03 - going down and down and down
08:05 - but keep in mind you know what it says
08:07 - over here there are legacy websites
08:10 - that are actually still using it so
08:12 - those legacy websites might
08:14 - never go away it might take a really
08:16 - long time to go away so
08:17 - there's still going to be jobs available
08:19 - for it but it's slowly going kind of
08:20 - peter out
08:22 - so you know time to die
08:29 - somebody says the only thing that is
08:30 - dying is my patience with all the bugs
08:33 - yeah with all the bugs haha working
08:35 - while watching your stream
08:37 - good job though thank you so much and
08:39 - yeah coding when you're coding there are
08:41 - tons of tons of bugs
08:42 - that will come into your code and make
08:45 - your life
08:45 - really really difficult so it just is
08:48 - what it is
08:50 - so just winder says amazon does use
08:52 - pearl
08:53 - though they are migrating so you can see
08:55 - that pearl is being used but
08:57 - people are migrating from it right
09:00 - pot liquor says and this is true legacy
09:03 - code is money still
09:04 - guaranteed yep is still money if you're
09:07 - trying to have a very secure future
09:09 - that's the only reason and if you're a
09:10 - complete beginner right now
09:12 - maybe you might not want to look into
09:14 - this programming language but if you
09:15 - already are experienced developer
09:17 - and you have experience with perl i'm
09:18 - sure there are plenty of jobs
09:20 - you can find so just want to say that so
09:22 - you guys have
09:24 - both sides to it yeah rashov says your
09:27 - content is too real and helpful
09:28 - big thanks really really appreciate it
09:30 - rishov we also really really appreciate
09:32 - you
09:34 - and let's keep rocking and rolling
09:35 - hopefully you guys are
09:37 - enjoying this now in position number two
09:41 - let's do a little drum roll please
09:45 - in position number two we got objective
09:48 - c now this is a programming language
09:51 - that is being used that was being used
09:56 - by apple but apple over the last like 35
09:58 - years
09:59 - has been slowly trying to kill it and
10:02 - get it out it's kind of like apple's
10:05 - internet explorer
10:06 - and by the way i don't know if you guys
10:08 - know but internet explorer is actually
10:09 - officially dead
10:11 - as a four days ago microsoft made an
10:13 - announcement
10:14 - and they are officially killing support
10:17 - for
10:17 - internet explorer
10:20 - everybody just moment of silence your
10:22 - thoughts and prayers so the only browser
10:24 - that you use to download
10:25 - other browsers it's time for internet
10:28 - explorer to die
10:29 - along with some programming languages
10:31 - like objective c
10:34 - and according to the pipal index you can
10:36 - see it's in position number eight
10:38 - and it is definitely on the decline
10:40 - compared to python and javascript you
10:42 - can see objective c
10:43 - is also pretty much non-existent
10:46 - time to go and over here we can see in
10:49 - the dreaded
10:49 - it is um yeah people are like rip
10:55 - uh really wow yep it's gone it's gone
10:58 - chrome dev tools all the way future code
11:01 - let's go
11:04 - ready dev says only use internet
11:06 - explorer only for downloading
11:08 - chrome yep rip internet explorer
11:14 - yep there you go so it's time for it to
11:16 - go but
11:17 - check this out right objective c right
11:19 - over here it's the second
11:20 - most dreaded programming language
11:22 - according to
11:24 - the stack overflow developers
11:28 - because microsoft is moving over to edge
11:30 - so that's why they just completely
11:32 - killed it
11:33 - now again look on youtube as well not
11:36 - much support for it not much going on
11:39 - 248 000 views five years ago not many
11:42 - new tutorials coming out for it so
11:44 - definitely something maybe you should
11:46 - avoid and learn
11:47 - other things instead apple's objective c
11:51 - is 35 years old and it's clear that the
11:54 - company wants it dead
11:55 - five years ago apple executives took to
11:58 - the stage to unveil
11:59 - swift its new and improved programming
12:01 - language for its software ecosystem
12:03 - no doubt they expected developers to
12:05 - quickly embrace swift at objective c's
12:08 - expense
12:09 - so swift was developed from objective c
12:13 - but then swift became where apple is now
12:16 - moving forward with that's how all ios
12:19 - apps are now being developed all right
12:22 - so
12:23 - that's why objective c so at some point
12:25 - objective c
12:26 - will likely fade away entirely
12:29 - so there it is right
12:33 - until then objective c get some rest but
12:36 - i think you're going to be going
12:38 - out of the picture soon and yeah
12:41 - rishabh says is learning swift worth
12:43 - yeah if you want to do mobile
12:44 - development
12:45 - definitely worth learning swift
12:48 - definitely worth learning flutter
12:50 - definitely worth learning react native
12:52 - those are all
12:53 - very very worth to learn and you know
12:57 - see which one you like the best from
12:58 - within that
13:00 - um we have 500 people watching this live
13:03 - right now thank you guys so much and
13:05 - guys if you just do me a favor
13:06 - so this video you can just go out to
13:08 - more and more people smash that like
13:10 - button if you're enjoying it
13:11 - and again also subscribe to the channel
13:13 - where this is a channel where
13:15 - we help people become developers and
13:18 - this is the fastest growing coding
13:20 - channel on the planet and our goal this
13:22 - year
13:22 - is to help 5 000 people get full-time
13:25 - jobs
13:26 - as developers that's our number one
13:28 - mission and vision
13:29 - at clever programmer for the year 2020
13:32 - and 2021 we want to hit 10 000
13:35 - people to get jobs as developers so
13:37 - really pumped about that
13:39 - now number one are you ready
13:42 - for the number one dying
13:46 - programming language are you ready
13:49 - i'm gonna give it a few drumrolls right
13:51 - over here let me put my mic
13:53 - a little bit down because i think i'm
13:55 - blowing you guys let me let me give you
13:56 - a little
13:57 - drumroll boom
14:00 - you ready are you actually ready
14:05 - really because i don't buy it i don't
14:07 - think you're ready
14:09 - wait for it we're about to get into it
14:11 - and the number one programming language
14:14 - is
14:16 - actually guys uh let's just do some
14:19 - stretching right now
14:21 - all right right here here we go
14:24 - all right all right all right the number
14:26 - one programming language
14:28 - for real or the number one dying
14:30 - programming language
14:31 - is visual basic microsoft's
14:35 - dreaded dreaded visual basic vba
14:40 - all right this is one programming
14:41 - language people try to run away from
14:44 - and you can see over here that it is
14:47 - ranked
14:47 - 15 and is on the decline
14:51 - and why it's dying not only is it losing
14:54 - popularity over time
14:56 - you know of course if you compare it
14:57 - python and javascript it's like super
14:59 - like
15:00 - low and kind of on the decline but
15:02 - another reason why it's dying is just
15:04 - because it's the most dreaded
15:06 - programming language
15:07 - it was used a lot back in the day
15:10 - nowadays
15:11 - it's not really used and nobody is
15:13 - really trying to use it that much
15:15 - now of course the disclaimer there are
15:17 - still jobs available for it if you did
15:19 - learn it you could still get jobs all
15:21 - right
15:22 - so just keep that in mind don't get your
15:23 - panties tied in a twist
15:25 - and here is vba the number one most
15:28 - dreaded programming language
15:29 - according to stack overflow
15:32 - and over here you can see that the
15:35 - tutorial for this was made like six
15:37 - years ago and
15:38 - a lot of this is you know kind of long
15:40 - long time ago
15:41 - so a little bit of less support so there
15:45 - you have it and here is a bonus for all
15:48 - of you guys
15:49 - php is also on the decline but php is
15:53 - still popular just because again
15:54 - remember
15:55 - wordpress remember a lot of legacy
15:58 - websites so the work
16:00 - will be there don't worry about it if
16:02 - you enjoy it you truly enjoy it
16:04 - learn it you'll still be able to get
16:06 - jobs for it
16:07 - but overall it's on the decline these
16:10 - programming languages
16:12 - have been you know they're a little bit
16:14 - outdated
16:15 - if you're new use the more modern stuff
16:17 - you'll be up and running quicker
16:19 - the community support is a lot better
16:22 - the tutorials you can watch online on
16:26 - you know whether you watch it on youtube
16:27 - or udemy or udacity whatever
16:29 - it's just going to be much easier for
16:30 - you to pick it up build a career out of
16:32 - it right
16:33 - so why wouldn't you do that and why
16:35 - would you go the old way and learn
16:37 - all things if you don't really have a
16:39 - particularly good reason
16:42 - so that is you know
16:45 - if you look at php over here you can see
16:47 - that it used to be really popular
16:49 - then but you know high-level programming
16:52 - languages like python and javascript
16:53 - started taking over
16:54 - so in red and yellow you have python and
16:58 - javascript and the blue one over here is
17:00 - php and you can see
17:01 - how php started declining boom boom boom
17:03 - boom boom boom boom boom
17:05 - and then all the way here now currently
17:07 - in 2020
17:08 - it's on the steepest decline that it's
17:10 - been
17:11 - all right so definitely useful but
17:14 - on a very steep decline
17:19 - and you can see according to stack
17:21 - overflow
17:22 - it is one of the most dreaded
17:24 - programming languages with 62 percent of
17:27 - the people saying it's
17:28 - dreaded so this is stack overflow survey
17:32 - straight up data not dead but
17:35 - on the decline all right and on the
17:38 - pipal index
17:39 - you can see that it's over here in
17:41 - position number
17:43 - six and uh yep there we go so we have
17:46 - some tutorials for it but again they
17:48 - were
17:48 - a while ago and
17:52 - there you go guys that's all folks
17:56 - peace and love peace and love
18:00 - hopefully you guys enjoyed the top four
18:02 - dying programming languages
18:05 - you guys got a kick out of it and had
18:07 - fun but just again remember
