02:30 - same time like what developer world do
02:33 - you know where you have 600 people live

02:39 - the biggest companies that i know like
02:41 - firebase and all of this stuff and we
02:43 - have all these people live so thank you
02:45 - guys so much

02:50 - dive in just want to thank our sponsor
02:52 - for making this possible third web we're
02:55 - going to be using the technology to
02:56 - build the projects and they have allowed
02:59 - this event to happen so i just want to
03:01 - take a second to thank them because
03:02 - that's you know they are what makes this
03:04 - type of event possible
03:07 - and again we're going to be using some
03:08 - of their technology
03:11 - uh to build out this event right that's
03:12 - we're going to be building our own nft
03:15 - yep
03:16 - okay um i know a lot of you guys said
03:19 - you completed the homework it's all good
03:21 - so you can drop it in the chat if you

03:24 - that's totally fine and here's the
03:26 - agenda for today this is day two and
03:28 - we're gonna building an amazing project
03:31 - all right that's what's gonna happen and
03:32 - day three tomorrow we're gonna go over
03:35 - how to land the front end developer job
03:37 - in 90 days okay this is the project that
03:40 - we're going to be building we just kind
03:42 - of went over this and remember to show
03:44 - up for the last day guys because that's
03:46 - going to be one of the most special days

03:53 - last day
03:55 - and with that said let's get started
03:57 - with today's training
03:59 - so a couple of things that i want to say
04:02 - to preface this okay and
04:05 - i think this is going to be really
04:06 - important
04:08 - we're going to be building a pretty
04:10 - awesome project it's going to be you
04:12 - know mind-blowing it's gonna be exciting
04:14 - but here's what's gonna happen a lot of
04:16 - you are beginners
04:18 - maybe and even some of you who are like
04:20 - intermediate you're still maybe not
04:21 - advanced
04:22 - because we're gonna build this entire
04:24 - project in one day
04:26 - i'm gonna have to be going really fast
04:29 - okay and i'm gonna be going a pretty
04:30 - fast speed which means a lot of you are
04:34 - gonna start freaking out a lot of you
04:36 - are gonna be like i can't keep up
04:39 - or i'm not able to make this progress
04:41 - and then what happens is this you guys
04:44 - see right now look around you in the
04:45 - zoom and you see all these other faces
04:47 - around you right you guys see how many
04:49 - people does it say we have right now on
04:51 - zoom how many people does it say right
04:53 - now we have live on zoom or youtube how
04:55 - many people
05:03 - it says we got 600 live total but we
05:06 - have 162 live on zoom right we got 162.
05:10 - watch what happens to that number i
05:12 - promise you this is the day when that
05:14 - number drops the most can you can you
05:16 - guys guess why that number drops the
05:18 - most on this day
05:22 - why does it happen frustration people
05:24 - can't keep up people get scared
05:27 - yes give up saturday discourage it's not
05:30 - easy
05:32 - yes so today is the day where stuff gets
05:35 - hard today is the day where it actually
05:37 - gets challenging because you're actually
05:39 - coding
05:40 - okay so that number keep an eye on it i
05:43 - promise you it's gonna have the steepest
05:45 - drop of all the other days because it's
05:47 - coding related okay
05:49 - so for those of you that stay
05:51 - which of you guys are planning to stay
05:53 - and stick through it and don't lie to me
05:55 - it's fine you can tell me the truth
05:57 - which ones of you are gonna commit to
05:59 - actually staying and seeing it through
06:01 - today you're like i'm not gonna leave
06:02 - until this project is freaking done how
06:06 - many of you are doing that
06:09 - every single one of you that is saying
06:10 - yes me i will
06:13 - i'm gonna hold you accountable to that
06:15 - okay we can download this chat and see
06:17 - exactly which one of you guys are saying
06:19 - so i want to hold you accountable to
06:20 - that
06:22 - um i want to mentally prepare you before
06:24 - we get into it
06:26 - because i want to make sure that you you
06:28 - get through it okay and
06:30 - last thing i want to say
06:33 - right before we get in this is the last
06:34 - thing i promised and then we're going to
06:35 - jump in last thing i want to say
06:37 - is this
06:40 - if it gets challenging which it will
06:42 - just watch it just relax and just watch
06:44 - it you don't need to keep up with me you
06:45 - don't need to code it right alongside me
06:48 - you're probably not going to be able to
06:49 - because i'm going to be going really
06:50 - fast
06:52 - worst case scenario you can watch the
06:54 - replay later okay so you can try your
06:56 - best to keep up with me you can always
06:58 - watch it later what i would say is just
07:00 - like main thing is you watch you you
07:02 - just look at a high level and understand
07:04 - what i'm doing oh he's writing these
07:06 - lines of code and it's doing this type
07:07 - of stuff on his screen cool like i'm
07:10 - getting coding i'm understanding it does
07:12 - that make sense guys
07:14 - then after today is done you can go hard
07:17 - and you can like finish it out later
07:19 - right after it's done break up into your
07:21 - groups team up with somebody and work
07:23 - alongside them and like finish the
07:25 - entire project out stay up late whatever
07:27 - the case may be so that by tomorrow
07:28 - you're done okay then you can go at your
07:31 - own pace the video is going to be
07:32 - recorded you could go slow it down break
07:34 - it up does that make sense guys
07:38 - so
07:40 - just giving you a heads up some of you
07:41 - might not be able to get node installed
07:43 - some of you may not be able to get
07:44 - metamask or or third web figured out
07:47 - some of you will fall off at like you
07:49 - know some lines of code it's okay just
07:52 - be prepared for that you can always do
07:55 - it later all right this is something
07:57 - difficult we're doing we're building a
07:58 - big project right
08:00 - so
08:01 - are all of you with me on that
08:04 - can i get an agreement on that if you're
08:06 - in agreement with me on that then we'll
08:08 - continue and actually get started
08:10 - yes with me agree let's do it
08:14 - okay omar says damn i clicked on the
08:16 - video out of curiosity
08:17 - and now i'm hooked fantastic amazing
08:20 - happy to hear that all right with that
08:23 - said
08:24 - let's just freaking go let's do this
08:26 - thing here we go
08:29 - all right guys
08:30 - so this is the project that we're gonna
08:31 - be building keep in mind we're gonna
08:33 - build this freaking thing from complete
08:35 - scratch okay
08:37 - that's our goal you guys can see the
08:39 - screen right give me a thumbs up if you
08:41 - can
08:42 - see the screen beautiful i'm gonna build
08:44 - this damn thing from scratch
08:47 - so
08:49 - uh first thing we're gonna do
08:51 - is uh let's go to third web all right we
08:54 - gave you guys a link to third web
08:58 - all right so this is the link we want
09:00 - you to use you can even copy paste this
09:02 - exact link this is really important
09:04 - because
09:05 - this is the link that works with clever
09:07 - programmer and that's the link that also
09:09 - gives you access to third web for free
09:11 - so make sure that's the link that you're
09:13 - using okay maybe we can drop it in a
09:15 - chat for everybody as well yeah we did
09:18 - okay
09:19 - and if we want to drop it on youtube as
09:21 - well
09:23 - we could do that i guess
09:25 - okay
09:27 - uh
09:29 - okay
09:30 - cool
09:31 - let's put that on youtube description so
09:33 - this is the one that you're gonna go to
09:37 - now what i'm just going to do is i'm
09:38 - going to just create a new account here
09:40 - on my meta mask so i just clicked on my
09:42 - meta mask and i'll just create a brand
09:45 - new account okay
09:46 - if you have a new account you you don't
09:48 - even need to do this but i'll just do
09:50 - this to keep everything super clean okay
09:52 - so i'm gonna say react.js
09:54 - and um
09:56 - december 11 okay december 11th just to
09:59 - keep it clean for me so i'll hit create
10:02 - okay now you see here i have rinky b
10:05 - test network this is very important that
10:07 - you actually get this right if you don't
10:09 - get this right it's not going to work a
10:10 - lot of you are probably going to be on
10:12 - ethereum mainnet
10:14 - okay
10:14 - here's what you need to do
10:16 - you see this over here where it says
10:18 - show and hide test networks
10:21 - right click that
10:24 - okay uh any of you guys with me so far
10:27 - if you are do let me know that you are
10:29 - doing this on meta mask and stuff
10:35 - okay and then toggle this on where it
10:38 - says
10:39 - uh
10:40 - show test networks
10:42 - once you turn this on show test networks
10:45 - now it will show up and you can actually
10:47 - choose rankinb test network okay
10:50 - so that's the one that you want to
10:51 - choose
10:54 - okay
10:56 - cool
10:56 - amazing now once we're done with that
10:58 - let's hit let's get started
11:00 - okay
11:01 - and hit connect wallet so i'm going to
11:04 - connect my wallet with metamask now for
11:06 - some reason it always brings up coinbase
11:08 - i'm going to deny because i don't want
11:10 - it to connect to my coinbase i just
11:11 - wanted to connect to my metamask
11:14 - and this is the wallet that i wanted to
11:16 - connect to so i'll hit next and i'll hit
11:18 - connect
11:20 - so now it's connected i'll hit continue
11:23 - now it's asking me which network i want
11:25 - to do so i'll say rinkeby
11:28 - okay
11:29 - cool if you're done then all good
11:31 - and then i'll just say create first
11:33 - project on rinkiby okay
11:35 - so that's it for now we're done with
11:37 - that now there was a little warning that
11:39 - came up that said hey you don't have any
11:41 - eath you don't have any ethereum so
11:44 - we're gonna get uh free ethereum today
11:46 - okay who wants some free ethereum
11:49 - hopefully that should excite everybody
11:52 - okay um so we're gonna get some free
11:55 - ethereum but this is a test network okay
11:58 - so what that means is it's fake ethereum
12:01 - that we're getting okay test so we're
12:03 - not moving any real money around so
12:05 - don't worry nothing is none of this is
12:06 - gonna cost you anything guess what guys
12:09 - everything today is going to be free
12:10 - that's going to be nice okay so you
12:12 - don't have to pay for anything
12:14 - okay so go to this link here
12:17 - faucets.chain.link slash rinkaby we'll
12:20 - drop it in zoom chat
12:22 - okay and we'll drop it on youtube as
12:24 - well let's put that link on youtube as
12:26 - well
12:29 - yeah wag me we're gonna make it that's
12:31 - right
12:32 - and uh we're gonna put our account
12:35 - address here
12:36 - all right so let's do that in just a
12:38 - second so create new project name and
12:41 - i'll just say cp punks
12:44 - let's hit create
12:47 - all right now it's going to ask me oh
12:48 - wait i can't create yet
12:50 - oh yeah right right right right right
12:52 - okay i'll hit reject on this for now and
12:55 - here's what we're gonna do we're gonna
12:56 - click our
12:58 - um
12:59 - we're gonna click our meta mask and
13:00 - click this over here and it's gonna
13:02 - allow you to copy it to clipboard okay
13:05 - now that it's copied i'm going to go
13:07 - back to faucets and i'm going to paste
13:09 - my address
13:10 - this is so it can send me free ethereum
13:12 - because i need it
13:15 - choose select 0.1 test eth okay
13:19 - and uncheck this box you just need this
13:21 - one checked hit i'm not a robot and then
13:24 - hit send request okay i'll zoom in so
13:26 - everybody can see clearly
13:30 - free eth
13:32 - yes
13:35 - okay beautiful
13:37 - wow that number hasn't dropped yet we
13:39 - are at 164 people on zoom still
13:41 - interesting how many people do we have
13:43 - on live
13:45 - 319 nice on youtube
13:49 - uh rinky's the network you're selecting
13:51 - if you want to select
13:54 - okay
13:55 - so you can see this transaction has
13:57 - initiated so it's going to take a second
13:59 - but it's going to send 0.1
14:02 - uh testnet eth to my account
14:06 - it's taking longer than usual so we'll
14:08 - just wait and see what happens
14:15 - david why is it taking so long is it
14:17 - because we're all jumping in it and
14:18 - doing it
14:20 - i mean i guess a thousand people are
14:22 - dripping
14:22 - [Music]
14:24 - or drip requests
14:26 - ah clarification expired wow we might
14:30 - have broken it guys unfortunately
14:37 - uh interesting
14:48 - all right let's give it a tr let's give
14:50 - it one more try
14:52 - if this doesn't work i'll have to use
14:54 - maybe a previous account of mine david
14:56 - maybe check out if there's other
14:58 - platforms as well that allow us to get
15:00 - free
15:01 - the reason why we need this is because
15:03 - when you're going to mint your project
15:05 - you're going to need like ethereum in
15:06 - there okay so that's why we need it
15:10 - you're going to need to pay gas fees and
15:11 - things like that
15:13 - um oh some some people got it already
15:18 - maybe this faucet
15:19 - [Music]
15:23 - yeah that's it for today
15:25 - thanks for coming everybody
15:29 - all right so if it does not work guys
15:31 - i'm just going to use my existing
15:33 - account
15:34 - and we'll go off of that
15:36 - unfortunately
15:40 - i think that's going to be the best way
15:44 - all right
15:45 - okay so let's uh let's go back to third
15:48 - web all right i will connect it to a
15:51 - different um
15:52 - wall oh causey yours just went through
15:55 - actually
15:56 - i saw some other people saying that even
15:58 - though the faucet said it failed
16:02 - the transaction went oh interesting yeah
16:04 - you're right
16:05 - zero points just double check yeah yeah
16:08 - okay okay so even though it said it
16:10 - failed that's a good point thank you
16:11 - david it actually looks like it it sent
16:13 - me 0.1 eth
16:16 - okay
16:16 - uh who did this work for already who has
16:19 - some eat like raise your hands if you
16:21 - have something
16:22 - use your hands
16:24 - okay we have a couple of people got some
16:26 - somebody 0.3 0.2
16:29 - okay beautiful
16:31 - yup
16:32 - awesome so cool so we got this working
16:34 - i'm going to call it cp punx and i'll
16:36 - hit create
16:38 - i'll hit next and connect
16:41 - so now my wallet and metamask is
16:42 - connected i'll hit confirm over here
16:45 - david you want to go ahead and mute
16:46 - yourself we can hear your typing
16:50 - it sounds nice though
16:52 - if you had a mechanical keyboard that
16:54 - would sound even nicer
17:01 - okay
17:02 - so
17:03 - while this project is happening all of
17:05 - these take a second to kind of get
17:07 - started
17:08 - but all we're doing right now is we're
17:10 - creating a new project okay and now
17:14 - inside of this project
17:16 - we'll be able to create new modules so
17:18 - i'll show you i just hit add module
17:20 - and uh there's six different options
17:22 - that we have here
17:24 - so you could create your own
17:25 - cryptocurrency right so for example
17:28 - you could call it whatever you want like
17:29 - chris taylor if chris taylor
17:32 - drops
17:33 - his um cryptocurrency you could
17:35 - literally call it chris taylor ct
17:38 - right and it would be
17:40 - competing with uh
17:42 - ethereum and and people would be able to
17:44 - buy it and get it and things like that
17:47 - you could also build your own
17:48 - marketplace which is like if you built
17:50 - your own open c the one thing that we're
17:52 - going to be looking at is nfts
17:55 - okay we're going to build our nft
17:56 - connect collection so click click this
17:59 - and just hit setup module
18:01 - all right and
18:04 - while we're setting this up
18:07 - all we're going to say here is again for
18:09 - me i think i'm just going to call it cp
18:11 - punx
18:13 - and it's asking me for an image and i'll
18:15 - just give it this image here you can
18:17 - give it whatever image you want i just
18:19 - had a couple of images that that i want
18:21 - to go with
18:22 - uh and in terms of these assets if you
18:24 - guys want access to these assets maybe
18:26 - david or amanath you maybe we want to
18:28 - give them the assets that they'll need
18:29 - later
18:32 - okay cool
18:34 - so
18:35 - yeah and for the symbol
18:37 - you know again it doesn't matter but
18:38 - i'll just call it like cp
18:41 - you know cpp for our cp punks
18:44 - um and i'll do 10 royalty but that none
18:47 - of that matters here because it's all
18:49 - free and
18:51 - uh it's on a test network so now it's
18:53 - asking me it's going to take some gas
18:55 - fee so i'll hit confirm
19:06 - and you'll see that with third web they
19:08 - make it so easy for you to actually just
19:10 - launch your own project and then to mint
19:13 - your own nfts it's
19:15 - you can do that all point and click and
19:16 - super fast
19:34 - mine is still creating a project it's
19:36 - all good
19:38 - okay
19:39 - awesome so now it's like hey mint your
19:42 - first nft so i'm gonna actually mint a
19:44 - couple of nfts here all this means is
19:46 - i'm creating my art i'm like putting up
19:48 - some of my art okay so i'm mint the
19:51 - process is called minting
19:54 - so i'm gonna get my first guy and we'll
19:56 - call the first guy let's say
19:59 - um
20:01 - bandana
20:02 - punk okay
20:04 - so it's going to be this guy right here
20:08 - and for price
20:11 - we'll we'll give him a property we'll
20:13 - give him a key price and the value we're
20:15 - going to give it is going to be like
20:17 - eight okay this this in my mind just
20:19 - represents like eight eth okay so hit
20:22 - mint nft
20:24 - this is gonna take a second it's also
20:26 - gonna charge you gas fees so just hit
20:28 - confirm on everything that pops up
20:31 - and again it's gonna take some time to
20:33 - load but once it's done what you're
20:35 - gonna see is you're gonna have uh
20:37 - some a minted you know bandana punk or
20:40 - whatever art you want right you could
20:42 - look up any type of art you could put
20:44 - your own face here if you wanted to and
20:46 - you could have your own type of nft
20:50 - my nfts is still loading so far so good
20:53 - nice
20:54 - okay so i got my first nft minted on
20:56 - here i'm gonna hit mint and um i'll drop
20:59 - another one i want a couple
21:02 - of them so i can actually use them right
21:04 - so let's call her
21:06 - what do i want to call her
21:08 - i feel like calling her cyberpunk
21:12 - will give her a price
21:15 - and for her price we will say and and
21:17 - make it all lower case right don't make
21:19 - it like
21:20 - uh uppercase price or whatever this will
21:22 - matter
21:23 - later on
21:25 - actually
21:26 - i don't think it will but but that's
21:28 - fine just make it all lower case for now
21:30 - and um i think she's gonna be a more
21:32 - expensive one like 13 eth so let's just
21:35 - put 13 here and we'll mint her
21:39 - what's cool about the blockchain is
21:41 - completely immutable right so once you
21:44 - actually put this on you can never edit
21:46 - this you can never ever delete this it's
21:50 - permanently there so for example all the
21:52 - crypto punks that are on there
21:54 - like they're just permanent they're
21:56 - never gonna go away the coding part
21:59 - is going to come up all right but first
22:01 - we just got to do all this setup
22:05 - all right i'm going to put a couple of
22:07 - other ones i'm going to mint a couple of
22:09 - other ones so this one is going to be
22:10 - called um
22:12 - you know the
22:15 - is that a cigar what is that thing
22:16 - called yeah let's just say
22:18 - cigar hat punk
22:21 - all right there we go and for price
22:24 - i don't know 90th for for this one
22:29 - you could add other properties in there
22:30 - as well like for example you could add
22:32 - the property like skin white you could
22:35 - add the property hat color blue you
22:37 - could add the property um cigar true
22:42 - and that might define like if it's more
22:44 - rare you know if this is something
22:46 - that's more rare that people might want
22:48 - to get
22:50 - because if you look at most other crypto
22:52 - punks or like most other nfts they have
22:54 - their own properties right
22:56 - okay
22:58 - anybody on this with me so far anybody
23:01 - doing any of this so far
23:03 - still creating a project
23:05 - go ahead yeah people are saying that the
23:07 - ethereum network is taking a lot
23:10 - to
23:11 - load
23:12 - yeah so
23:13 - okay
23:15 - okay
23:16 - um
23:20 - let's call him captain america
23:23 - punk
23:24 - okay
23:25 - just because i see red white blue and
23:28 - we'll say price
23:30 - let's make him uh 17 eth this one is
23:33 - pretty
23:34 - cool okay and uh we're generally we're
23:37 - just gonna mint two more nfts and then
23:40 - after that we should be good with this
23:42 - okay so
23:43 - whenever you guys get to this part just
23:45 - mint a couple of them and you should be
23:47 - good
23:49 - where am i grabbing the images from i
23:50 - just literally have a folder
23:53 - with six of these images which hopefully
23:55 - maybe a mononauth and david can give you
23:56 - guys
23:58 - um
23:59 - do you guys want me to drop these on
24:01 - slack and you guys can hand them this uh
24:04 - we like a monarch is dropping it
24:07 - oh so you guys have these images yep
24:10 - yep okay cool
24:12 - yeah so i'm literally just pulling them
24:14 - from there okay
24:16 - um
24:20 - all right and i will mint two two more
24:26 - all right there we go
24:29 - mint
24:31 - and we will do pirate king
24:35 - punk
24:37 - and let's go price let's make him 37 eth
24:43 - i mean that is one of the most lit ones
24:44 - right and maybe the crown is a super
24:46 - rare trait and that makes it
24:49 - a little bit more on the expensive side
24:51 - wow we're at 168 people on zoom
24:54 - and 315 we're starting to see some we're
24:57 - starting to see some droppers on youtube
24:59 - because youtube is going to be a more
25:01 - casual right for most people it's more
25:03 - casual platform so we're going to see
25:05 - some droppers but i'm really curious to
25:06 - see some droppers and when that starts
25:08 - actually on zoom because i know it's
25:09 - going to start
25:11 - i i predict it starts usually when you
25:13 - start coding
25:16 - so we'll be well about well we're about
25:18 - to start coding probably in like a
25:19 - minute or two
25:21 - we're very close to it
25:23 - okay and then let's just drop one more
25:25 - okay and um
25:28 - green
25:30 - um
25:31 - tennis hulk
25:33 - i don't know why that comes to my mind
25:35 - punk
25:36 - and uh for price we're just gonna say
25:39 - this is a 18th one okay we'll mint
25:46 - all right and i will accept
25:49 - all the fees
25:53 - okay
25:55 - it's ready to be minted
26:01 - okay so guys look at this we have our
26:04 - very first nft project we have it minted
26:06 - ready to go
26:08 - if you wanted you could actually go and
26:09 - uh
26:11 - tell your family members to buy it
26:14 - or friends so all right so we got all of
26:16 - our punks this is all i wanted for now
26:19 - six starts from zero that's why
26:22 - and um
26:24 - you can see they're all owned by this
26:26 - wallet address which in this case is me
26:29 - okay
26:30 - so i am uh good on this side
26:36 - i'm going to close the slides over here
26:39 - all right and now
26:43 - make this a little bit smaller so you
26:44 - all can see
26:46 - okay
26:48 - and now i'm ready to get my project
26:49 - started
26:50 - okay i'll create a folder if you're on
26:52 - windows you probably have to do mkdir
26:54 - but i'll just md
26:56 - and we'll say
26:58 - react nft
27:01 - challenge
27:02 - okay and i'll just go in that folder
27:05 - nfte challenge
27:07 - you guys don't need to go into any
27:09 - folders if you don't want to or you
27:11 - don't know how to you can just do npx
27:13 - create react app no matter where you are
27:15 - all right and i'm just going to call
27:17 - this the same thing as the folder and
27:20 - we'll just say react nft
27:22 - challenge
27:24 - i'll just hit enter
27:28 - and so now what's happening is i'm
27:30 - getting my react project started okay
27:32 - it's installing my react project
27:34 - and then that essentially means that
27:36 - i'll be able to start coding now okay
27:40 - just getting it completely set up
27:45 - just long load for it to mint okay where
27:47 - do we get the images we're giving you
27:49 - guys links so you guys can download it
27:51 - finally got some eth going to watch for
27:53 - now but it's making sense julia awesome
27:55 - happy to hear that
27:57 - ben carter says why not using next.js
27:59 - just because we wanted it to be a little
28:00 - bit simpler for everybody to follow
28:02 - along
28:03 - initially when we were actually doing
28:05 - this project when we built it we did use
28:07 - next but we switched it over to react
28:09 - just to keep it simple
28:13 - we might give you guys the github url
28:16 - okay
28:18 - but not right now right now i just need
28:20 - all of you guys to focus and try to get
28:23 - it
28:24 - or just focus on watching it
28:29 - yeah ben there you go
28:31 - okay so i got this
28:33 - okay now all i need to do
28:37 - is open up my vs code which i just did
28:39 - right here i'll hit command o you can do
28:42 - control o on windows
28:44 - i'll go to my github folder we'll go to
28:48 - uh
28:49 - right here
28:50 - and this is the folder that you want to
28:52 - open okay this is a folder do not open
28:54 - this folder right there
28:56 - select this one all right this is what
28:59 - it should look like
29:01 - cool click it open
29:05 - now i don't need my command line anymore
29:06 - so just closed out of it
29:08 - and
29:12 - let's go right here
29:16 - okay
29:17 - let's hit
29:18 - app.js
29:22 - i just invited you david
29:26 - okay let's zoom in so you guys can see
29:28 - it maybe a little bit more clearer
29:31 - uh do you guys need me to zoom in more
29:32 - or is this good enough
29:36 - if this is good enough do let me know
29:43 - this is good enough give me a thumbs up
29:45 - or something
29:46 - okay perfect
29:51 - awesome
29:52 - yeah my react app downloaded fast
29:55 - okay awesome so now what i need to do
29:57 - guys is i'm just gonna pretty much
30:00 - remove everything
30:01 - from my app uh js i don't really
30:04 - like all the stuff that's inside of this
30:07 - return here right i don't need that okay
30:10 - but actually before you before you
30:11 - actually do that hold on hold on don't
30:12 - delete that yet just undo just real
30:14 - quick because i want to show you how to
30:16 - actually run your app okay so i'll hit
30:18 - yarn start here
30:20 - you could you could do npm start or you
30:22 - could do yarn start both will work for
30:24 - you
30:25 - okay
30:26 - and um
30:28 - it will open up for you
30:31 - in like a local host something okay so
30:33 - i'll go right here
30:36 - so for you it'll probably be localhost
30:39 - colon 3000 okay
30:42 - don't worry about why it's 3001 for me
30:44 - but it should be 3 000 for you okay it
30:47 - will also tell you here
30:49 - and this will get you to just run a
30:51 - normal react app right this is just the
30:53 - most bare-bone type of app that you
30:55 - could have
30:57 - now i'm going to remove all of this
30:58 - because i don't need it and we're going
31:00 - to start working on our header so when i
31:03 - say header i'm actually talking about
31:06 - this guy right here does that make sense
31:08 - guys when i say header right that's the
31:12 - header
31:14 - and this file is going to be called
31:15 - header.js actually
31:18 - okay
31:21 - so that's what we're gonna do
31:23 - i will take all of this and delete it
31:26 - okay
31:27 - and i will say header and now what's
31:30 - gonna happen is my app is going to break
31:31 - because it's going to be like i don't
31:33 - know what you're talking about
31:35 - about this header thing and we're going
31:37 - to say that's fine you don't need to
31:38 - know what i'm talking about because i
31:39 - haven't created it yet so i'm going to
31:41 - go into my source and i'm going to
31:42 - create a new folder i'll call it
31:44 - components and then inside of components
31:47 - i'll actually create a new file and
31:49 - it'll be called header.js
31:52 - here i can use a snippet which is rafce
31:57 - and hit tab and it'll auto-complete it
32:00 - if you don't have this snippet you could
32:02 - do command shift x go to your extensions
32:05 - and you could get a react snippets i
32:07 - believe it's called something like that
32:10 - yeah es7 snippets and just get this
32:12 - extension once you have this extension
32:15 - you'll have the same snippets that i
32:17 - have
32:19 - okay
32:19 - so
32:20 - now that i've done this i can just go
32:23 - you know i can do a h2 here and i can
32:25 - say
32:27 - i'm the header
32:31 - okay
32:33 - again if i'm going fast that's just
32:35 - because we want to get all of this
32:37 - covered in one day okay so
32:41 - yeah all right so let's go back to app
32:43 - here now what we need to do is you can
32:45 - just remove this character r here write
32:47 - it again it should ask you for this auto
32:50 - import hit enter
32:51 - and uh now you've imported your header
32:54 - so basically what we have done is we
32:56 - created our header component
32:58 - right and then we took it and we moved
33:00 - it to app.js
33:03 - i love the speed okay nice
33:06 - happy to hear that ah we got our first
33:08 - droppers guys everybody give it up i
33:11 - want to see you clapping for the first
33:13 - few droppers let's give it up yeah i
33:15 - want to see you all
33:16 - give it up guys
33:18 - give it up
33:19 - beautiful we got our first few droppers
33:21 - we're down to 160. okay this is what i'm
33:23 - looking for the more we get into coding
33:25 - the more it happens okay so
33:27 - um it's all good here we go so now i'm
33:31 - the header is popping up
33:33 - there's some weird margins around that i
33:35 - don't like and we don't really need them
33:37 - so i'm going to go to my index.css
33:40 - and in my index css all the way at the
33:43 - top
33:44 - all i want to do is i just want to say
33:46 - star like grab everything and i want to
33:48 - go margin 0 and i want to go padding 0
33:51 - and now all those like weird
33:53 - margins are gone because
33:55 - we don't need them right so gone
33:59 - the next thing we need to do
34:00 - is uh change the background color right
34:03 - what's the background color
34:06 - on my current app here and what's the
34:08 - background color on my final app
34:12 - this is the final app right so what's
34:14 - the background color here guys
34:16 - that's what the background color we need
34:18 - to have here so let's go to app.css
34:21 - okay
34:22 - and
34:23 - in our app.css we're going to do a
34:25 - couple of things let's make this a
34:27 - lowercase app first of all not
34:29 - uppercase and let's delete everything
34:31 - else
34:32 - besides that so let's just have this
34:35 - here
34:36 - i'm going to go to myapp.js and we're
34:38 - going to wrap this header in a div
34:42 - all right and this div will have a class
34:44 - name
34:45 - of app and we'll end it right there
34:48 - so
34:49 - in app.js you should just have
34:52 - a div that's called app
34:54 - with a header
34:55 - the reason for this is so we can now
34:57 - select this app and and basically style
35:00 - it right so let's go back to our app.css
35:04 - and we're going to start styling this
35:06 - okay so we have text align center but we
35:08 - don't need that so let's remove that
35:11 - all right and i'm going to say
35:13 - background color
35:15 - and we'll give it black
35:19 - perfect
35:22 - coding is what i'm here for this is dope
35:24 - okay beautiful
35:31 - yeah all right the next one so now what
35:33 - i'm going to do is i'm just going to say
35:35 - padding of 20 pixels so everything i
35:37 - want to kind of give it some padding
35:39 - okay and let's just go here let's see
35:41 - yeah so we have imported app.css so
35:44 - that's perfectly fine
35:46 - and then i want to say min height
35:48 - we'll go 100 vh
35:51 - and we'll go max with and we'll go 100
35:54 - vw
35:57 - just like this okay let's refresh
36:00 - all right so now that i've refreshed you
36:01 - can actually see the background color is
36:03 - black well where did my text go
36:06 - didn't i have text here
36:08 - what happened to it guys
36:11 - why is my text not showing up
36:15 - why is my text hidden
36:18 - it poofed
36:19 - yes the text is black that's why it's
36:22 - hidden right so i need to actually grab
36:24 - this text and make it white so i'll go
36:26 - to my header here
36:28 - and we'll wrap this in a div
36:32 - all right
36:37 - like that
36:38 - i'll wrap this in a div and we'll
36:40 - actually just give it a class name
36:44 - and what's the class name we should give
36:45 - it here guys what will make a lot of
36:48 - sense what should i call this class name
36:49 - here i'll give you a hint
36:51 - it's one of the words in here
36:54 - can you guess
36:57 - we'll call it header okay
37:00 - and now
37:02 - david nice
37:04 - and now we're gonna basically go inside
37:07 - and what we're going to do is we're
37:08 - going to create a new file and we'll
37:09 - call this header.css okay let's go
37:12 - header
37:13 - dot css
37:15 - and in here what i want to say is
37:20 - let's grab our header
37:25 - and what we'll do is we'll give it a
37:27 - color
37:28 - white okay let's go white like this
37:33 - all right
37:35 - okay once we're done giving it that
37:37 - color let's go back
37:40 - yep let's put a dot here because we're
37:43 - actually getting a class
37:46 - and the reason why it's not showing up
37:48 - is because we haven't imported this yet
37:50 - so let's go import
37:53 - header
37:55 - dot css
37:57 - boom there we go okay now we've imported
37:59 - it so now it shows up
38:02 - and there's a couple of other things we
38:03 - want to do to the header as well we want
38:05 - to give it a height because this will be
38:07 - useful
38:08 - um for later once we add all the other
38:10 - things inside of it because we're going
38:12 - to be adding the search bar and things
38:14 - like that let's give it a display of
38:16 - flex
38:17 - okay and this will make sense
38:19 - in a second too once we start actually
38:21 - adding
38:22 - other things to the header okay so for
38:25 - example if i took away this display flex
38:27 - you'll see what i mean okay so i'll add
38:29 - a couple of more things here so right
38:30 - underneath the header
38:33 - um i don't need this i'm the header
38:36 - anymore what i do need though is this
38:39 - cryptopunx
38:41 - logo right there okay that's that's what
38:43 - i need
38:44 - so i'm going to remove this
38:47 - and i will say
38:50 - class name
38:51 - and we'll have it be the logo container
38:54 - and inside of my logo container i'm just
38:56 - going to have an image
39:00 - and this is going to be my punk logo
39:03 - okay and then i'll give it a class name
39:07 - of punk logo as well
39:10 - now this image you might be like hey
39:11 - where is this image coming from causey
39:13 - i'm getting an error so now i'll show
39:15 - you what we need to do so in our source
39:17 - folder we actually need to create a
39:20 - folder
39:21 - and we want to call it assets
39:23 - okay inside of our assets we need to put
39:25 - all of our assets so i'll show you what
39:27 - that means
39:28 - okay
39:29 - so i'm grabbing all of my assets and i'm
39:31 - putting them in here
39:33 - okay i just moved them right now for you
39:36 - guys how you can actually do this is
39:38 - we've given you a google drive link with
39:40 - all of the assets so if you're watching
39:42 - this on youtube or zoom
39:43 - you will have access to all of these
39:45 - assets once you download it and what are
39:47 - these assets these assets are the images
39:49 - that we're going to need for this
39:51 - project for example
39:53 - this ethereum image
39:55 - is an asset you're going to need access
39:58 - to
39:59 - these images right this logo right here
40:02 - you're going to need access to this
40:04 - search icon right here okay
40:08 - all of this all of these are are an
40:10 - asset right and just to highlight a
40:12 - little bit more about the project right
40:14 - as as we go through it it's like think
40:15 - about it
40:16 - how how does like when i click here it
40:19 - changes this
40:21 - how is that happening and that's
40:23 - happening without any refresh or
40:25 - anything how come like when i'm
40:26 - scrolling how can i scroll all the way
40:29 - like this
40:30 - right all of these things are
40:33 - like require you to have a lot of
40:35 - front-end skills
40:37 - you know if you look at this button
40:38 - right over here it has this beautiful
40:39 - gradient how's that gradient there how
40:42 - do you add a gradient
40:43 - how does this have this circular
40:44 - background
40:46 - with that right there how come like all
40:48 - of these have these gaps these nice gaps
40:51 - in between and it gives us this nice
40:53 - spacing
40:55 - okay all of this stuff is
40:58 - super powerful right um and we're gonna
41:01 - walk you through how to do this
41:03 - okay so it goes i don't know the punk
41:04 - logo and what that is well that's not a
41:07 - problem we're simply just actually going
41:08 - to
41:10 - import it alright so what i'm going to
41:12 - do
41:13 - is i'll say import
41:16 - punk logo
41:17 - from
41:19 - and we'll go into our assets go into our
41:21 - header folder
41:22 - and it's actually right here this is the
41:26 - logo that we need it's right there
41:28 - okay so now
41:30 - i'll say
41:32 - crypto
41:34 - punk
41:37 - dash logo dot png
41:41 - okay so there we go
41:43 - now it's showing up
41:46 - okay
41:47 - so while you guys are watching this
41:50 - and even if it seems like it's difficult
41:52 - or you guys are not able to keep up
41:54 - because i know that that's fine that's
41:56 - normal
41:58 - when i'm adding for example this image
42:01 - right here
42:02 - or i'm i'm putting this image right
42:05 - there like does that make sense to you
42:07 - guys
42:08 - how i'm at least like maybe pulling this
42:10 - image and how this
42:12 - this line of code right here is
42:14 - literally what's bringing this image
42:16 - right here does that type of stuff make
42:17 - sense
42:19 - okay great
42:20 - so
42:21 - yeah kind of some people saying kind of
42:23 - some people say yes yes yes absolutely
42:25 - so yeah just totally normal okay so
42:28 - um my main goal is that you kind of at a
42:31 - high level
42:32 - understand what's going on
42:35 - okay
42:36 - awesome
42:38 - yeah one dot can make the difference
42:40 - which is why i think it's a good idea
42:41 - that you watch it later too at some
42:43 - point right and then go through it
42:45 - because i think that'll help uh that'll
42:46 - help you out a lot
42:49 - all right um amazing so we got this uh
42:52 - we got this right here now now we do
42:55 - need to change its size because i think
42:56 - it's still a little bit like a little
42:58 - bit big so i do want it to kind of
43:01 - become
43:02 - uh smaller now
43:04 - so let's go inside of our header
43:07 - and i'm going to just say logo
43:10 - container
43:12 - okay uh or actually
43:14 - i'm just gonna say punk logo
43:17 - and we'll make it its width 200 pixels
43:21 - all right now the reason why i didn't do
43:24 - anything is because we do need to um
43:28 - yeah so we actually have punk logo right
43:30 - there so that's fine
43:32 - let's go back punk logo with 200 pixels
43:37 - okay refresh
43:39 - there we go okay i just had to refresh
43:42 - so we selected this guy right here and
43:44 - we made it a little bit smaller
43:47 - okay
43:48 - next thing that we want to add guys
43:50 - what's the next thing in the header that
43:52 - we need to add so we just got done
43:54 - adding the logo so that's great but
43:56 - what's the next thing that we do need to
43:58 - add
43:59 - just visually
44:00 - yes exactly
44:02 - search bar right search bar is the next
44:04 - thing that we need to add so let's get
44:05 - to work on the search bar real quick
44:09 - so what i'm going to do is this is my
44:12 - header
44:13 - and this over here is my logo container
44:16 - now i'm going to go and start working on
44:18 - another div
44:20 - what's going to be the name of what's
44:22 - gonna be the class name can you guys
44:23 - guess
44:25 - so for example this was called this was
44:27 - a logo one right what's this one gonna
44:29 - be called
44:30 - you have to get the exact name right but
44:32 - if you just get certain parts of it
44:33 - right that's great so yeah search
44:35 - container is great search bar is great
44:37 - i'm just going to call it search bar if
44:39 - you got any of those great job you're
44:40 - you're you did fantastic okay
44:43 - um
44:45 - and then inside of it i'm going to
44:46 - create another div and this div is going
44:48 - to be there to hold
44:50 - this icon
44:52 - okay
44:53 - so what should i name this
44:56 - search icon
44:58 - container okay hopefully you guys are on
44:59 - the right track
45:01 - search icon beautiful okay awesome
45:04 - and then we're gonna give it an image
45:07 - right and for source i'm gonna give it
45:09 - search
45:10 - icon like this
45:12 - okay and then i don't need the alt tag
45:14 - now the search icon i also need to
45:16 - import it because otherwise it's going
45:18 - to give me an error
45:21 - so i have if i go into header i have
45:23 - search right there i'll just copy the
45:25 - relative path
45:27 - and i'll go here and i'll say import
45:30 - search icon from
45:32 - and i'll paste the relative path
45:35 - i'll replace the source with the dot dot
45:40 - and there we go
45:41 - okay search icon and search icon right
45:44 - there if i hit refresh it should work
45:46 - beautiful so now as you can see
45:49 - i have the search icon showing up
45:54 - and the last thing i want to do is i
45:56 - also want to put input in the search bar
45:59 - so we can actually take in some input so
46:01 - let's do input
46:07 - all right
46:08 - and we will give it a class name what's
46:10 - the class name that i should give the
46:12 - input bar what should i give this
46:18 - search input
46:19 - joe diaz asks are you destructuring i'm
46:22 - not doing any destructuring yet by the
46:24 - way i'm not doing any destructuring at
46:25 - all
46:26 - this here is
46:28 - just pulling um
46:31 - it's just using this variable right
46:32 - there
46:33 - okay
46:35 - it this here is literally the same thing
46:38 - as if i had just like
46:40 - copied this and pasted that right there
46:43 - okay it's kind of like that
46:45 - okay even though that's not gonna work
46:47 - but it's kind of like that
46:49 - okay so let's go back
46:53 - um
46:54 - and i'm putting the squigglies
46:56 - all right because i'm basically saying
46:58 - this is javascript that i'm about to
47:00 - write
47:02 - all right
47:04 - so i got my search input
47:07 - and then i'm going to give it a
47:08 - placeholder and we'll give it a
47:10 - placeholder of
47:12 - we'll say collection
47:14 - item or user dot dot dot just like this
47:18 - okay
47:19 - does this look good guys
47:20 - is this looking amazing
47:24 - this is kind of what we were after
47:29 - so now we want to work on and make it
47:31 - look amazing okay so let's go back to
47:33 - our header
47:34 - okay and
47:36 - what we want to do is let's go and make
47:39 - it display flex so first thing we need
47:40 - to do is put it in a row
47:42 - right it was showing up as columns
47:44 - that's not what we want we need it to be
47:45 - a row
47:46 - next up after that we need to actually
47:49 - give it a space between so you saw how
47:52 - it just gave it some spacing i know it's
47:54 - crazy right now but once we add other
47:56 - items it'll space it out evenly
47:59 - after this let's go align items and
48:01 - let's go center
48:02 - okay so this will vertically center this
48:05 - so it's not like up here
48:07 - okay
48:10 - next up we'll take the header
48:13 - and i'm going to give it a margin
48:16 - of 10 pixels
48:18 - okay cool
48:20 - so i basically grabbed these divs right
48:23 - and i
48:24 - gave some margin around so like some
48:26 - margin here here here and stuff like
48:28 - that
48:30 - okay so they moved like a little bit
48:32 - more inward so to speak okay
48:35 - the next thing i kind of want to do now
48:37 - is i want to start um
48:40 - doing stuff to my search bar so it looks
48:42 - nice so let's grab our search bar and
48:44 - let's give it a background color
48:47 - of we're going to go 1 c 1 c 1 e
48:52 - okay so you can start to see that color
48:54 - right there even though it's obviously
48:56 - you know not super
48:57 - super clear but you can you can start to
49:00 - see it
49:02 - we're going to give it a height of 50
49:05 - pixels
49:07 - i'll give it a flex of 1 and flex of 1
49:10 - makes it really long okay so you see
49:12 - that it just takes up all of the space
49:14 - because that's what we wanted to do
49:16 - right when i go when i make the screen
49:18 - bigger or smaller
49:20 - take a look at how this bar dynamically
49:23 - keeps moving
49:24 - right this is happening because we have
49:26 - done flex one
49:31 - i also want to enable flex mode on this
49:34 - and what we're going to do is now we
49:36 - want to give it some rounded corners
49:39 - so now this just gave it some nice
49:41 - rounded
49:42 - corners and i'll do align items
49:47 - and we'll go center
49:50 - okay
49:51 - so now is it starting to look a little
49:53 - bit better now guys does this look a
49:55 - little bit better than what we had
49:57 - before
49:59 - still not finished right but hopefully
50:02 - yeah it's looking a little bit better
50:03 - thank god for flexbox fire
50:06 - nice
50:07 - we're one step closer
50:09 - beautiful
50:11 - displayed flexi
50:16 - yes okay
50:19 - um let's get the search icon container
50:21 - and we'll put some margins around it
50:23 - right because you see how it's too close
50:25 - to the boundaries edges we don't like
50:27 - that
50:28 - so we want to actually do something
50:30 - about it so let's grab the container and
50:32 - we'll go margin
50:33 - 10 pixels
50:35 - all right there we go now you can see
50:37 - that there's some margin here and here
50:40 - okay
50:42 - the next thing we need to do is grab the
50:43 - search input and change its styling so
50:46 - first we're gonna do the background
50:48 - color and we're gonna make the
50:49 - background color transparent because we
50:51 - don't want it to have background color
50:53 - it still looks
50:54 - kind of hideous right so this is a this
50:57 - is called border we want to remove its
51:00 - border so let's go ahead and let's add a
51:02 - property called border and let's say
51:04 - none
51:06 - done it's gone
51:07 - now you guys see the you guys see when i
51:10 - select it it's only like this much
51:13 - that's kind of annoying right because
51:14 - when i start typing it'll only type
51:16 - within that
51:18 - so let's give it a width
51:22 - let's give it a width of a hundred
51:24 - percent
51:26 - all right so now when i click it
51:28 - wow it spans all the way across you know
51:30 - this is kind of what we wanted
51:31 - now the blue thing that that it
51:33 - highlights when we click it's called
51:35 - outline so what are we going to do with
51:37 - outline guys to make it go away i'll
51:39 - give you a hint it's just like how we
51:40 - made the border go away
51:44 - yes absolutely nice job anthony good job
51:48 - yes good job angel good job venky say
51:51 - great job perfect
51:54 - i'm gonna make it go away
51:56 - all right so let's go here
51:58 - boom now none of it is there anymore
52:00 - that's what we were looking for
52:03 - color we're going to give the text color
52:05 - we're going to give it off white
52:07 - all right
52:09 - so now when i click
52:11 - look at that it's showing up
52:14 - okay
52:16 - beautiful
52:19 - and uh let's give it a font
52:22 - size of
52:24 - 16.
52:26 - all right
52:28 - there we go now i'm able to write
52:30 - throughout it and it does work exactly
52:33 - how i want it to work
52:35 - does this look better guys does this
52:37 - look a lot better than before
52:40 - if you think it does give me a thumbs up
52:43 - but with that said we're done with the
52:45 - logo and we're done with the search bar
52:47 - guys we've already made a whole bunch of
52:49 - progress so if you've been watching it
52:52 - great job because you're learning okay
52:54 - even if you're not maybe doing it you're
52:56 - just watching trust me you're
52:58 - learning awesome
53:00 - now
53:02 - we need to add these okay so we're going
53:04 - to call these
53:06 - right here
53:07 - all right we're going to decide to call
53:09 - these header
53:12 - header items okay that's what we're
53:14 - gonna call them
53:19 - so let's work on our header items now so
53:21 - let's go back to header.js
53:24 - and
53:25 - we're done with the search bar
53:29 - all right and let's go and do this
53:31 - so i'll say div
53:35 - okay and
53:37 - what's the class name gonna be called
53:39 - guys can you guess
53:40 - class name what are we gonna call it
53:43 - what are we gonna call it
53:47 - header items great job
53:50 - wow we have a seven-year-old on here
53:52 - let's go
53:54 - monkey typist on youtube says
53:57 - i'm seven years old and you teach me a
53:59 - lot
54:01 - hey
54:02 - much love thank you so much for being on
54:03 - here appreciate it
54:06 - awesome so we got that done header items
54:09 - let's go in here
54:10 - and header items has a couple of header
54:13 - items has a couple of things okay
54:16 - it has
54:17 - three p tags one is drops
54:20 - the other is marketplace
54:23 - and then the other one after that is
54:25 - create
54:27 - all right
54:28 - it's these three guys right here so i
54:31 - just added them in
54:32 - this is what they look like
54:34 - all right does anybody have any idea how
54:36 - we can take them from a column and put
54:38 - them in a row
54:41 - let's go back to header css
54:44 - yes display flex great work guys so
54:47 - we're gonna go dot header items
54:50 - right and i'll go display flex
54:56 - okay
54:57 - uh display flex
55:02 - and let's refresh
55:03 - there we go
55:04 - now it's showing up in a row but if you
55:07 - actually notice it's showing up in a row
55:09 - but it's all attached to each other so
55:11 - we actually don't want that
55:14 - so what we're going to do
55:15 - for this and some of you guys are going
55:17 - to actually fall for this trap because
55:19 - some of you guys are gonna actually say
55:21 - okay let me ask you how would you put a
55:23 - space in between all of those
55:27 - okay
55:28 - i'll go to the answer
55:31 - yes so space evenly space between
55:33 - normally that would work but in this
55:35 - case it actually does not work okay so
55:38 - it's a trick question but if you did say
55:40 - space between you you are right normally
55:42 - that would work but in this case isaac
55:44 - great great job but it doesn't work just
55:46 - in this case okay normally that would
55:48 - work so
55:50 - let's give it a color though
55:53 - and i'll show you what does work it's
55:55 - because of the flex 1 that we did on the
55:57 - search bar that's what kind of tripped
55:58 - it up a little bit okay so we're going
55:59 - to do dot header items
56:01 - and we got a little hacky way of doing
56:03 - this
56:04 - we're gonna grab the p tags and in
56:06 - between the p tags we're just gonna add
56:08 - some margins
56:10 - right so let's refresh
56:12 - boom there we go all right so we just
56:14 - grabbed these p tags and we said in
56:15 - between all of them add some margin okay
56:18 - so that was a simple way of doing it
56:22 - gave it some nice spacing
56:24 - i know tricky question we got you guys
56:27 - so with that said we're done with header
56:29 - items guys we're flying through this
56:31 - right before we even realize we're done
56:34 - now the next things that we're going to
56:35 - build are going to be called header
56:37 - actions
56:38 - so these guys right here
56:40 - we're going to call it header actions
56:42 - header actions like this
56:44 - all right
56:47 - so let's work on that
56:49 - boom
56:51 - okay header items we're done with
56:55 - yeah look at that specificity beautiful
56:58 - yeah chris you like that specificity huh
57:00 - nice sarah is giving us a round of
57:02 - applause thank you sarah for the love
57:05 - all right here we go so i'm gonna create
57:07 - a div here and we'll say class name and
57:09 - what's the class name for this guys
57:12 - we're going to be creating the header
57:14 - actions this is going to be called
57:16 - header actions beautiful great job
57:21 - and then inside of it
57:23 - okay we're going to do another class
57:24 - name and i'll give you a hint
57:28 - we need to
57:30 - this logo right here
57:32 - all right this is our theme theme switch
57:35 - logo okay
57:37 - we need to put it in a container all
57:40 - right so we're gonna call this what
57:43 - should we call this
57:46 - the class name for this should be called
57:47 - what
57:53 - theme switch
57:54 - logo container yeah exactly something
57:56 - along those lines so we're going to say
57:58 - theme switch container okay fantastic
58:01 - you're on the right track theo good job
58:03 - even if you said dark mode container
58:05 - good job chris that's pretty much right
58:07 - theme switcher yeah
58:09 - all of those are along the right tracks
58:10 - okay
58:12 - and then here i'm gonna put an image
58:15 - all right and uh we're actually gonna
58:17 - use this image theme switch icon
58:20 - okay
58:21 - and of course we're gonna get this from
58:24 - this import right here so i'm gonna say
58:25 - import theme switch icon
58:28 - from
58:29 - dot dot slash assets header theme switch
58:31 - dot jpeg or png which is coming from
58:34 - right there
58:36 - all right
58:38 - okay
58:39 - so let's see if that worked
58:41 - let's go back here and boom it's there
58:44 - is it looking like how we want it to
58:46 - look though what's the difference
58:48 - between this one and this one this one
58:51 - and this one quickly guys what's the
58:53 - difference everybody if you're in here
58:55 - drop it in the comments below let me
58:57 - know okay drop in the comments below
58:59 - come on all of you guys can do that i
59:00 - want to read it from you guys size is
59:02 - the difference yes what else
59:04 - size and background good job monica what
59:06 - else
59:07 - no radius on the container yes raul good
59:10 - eyesight good job
59:12 - size and border yes rondelle fantastic
59:15 - background circle size good job evie
59:19 - yes
59:20 - background radius and color gerardo good
59:22 - job
59:24 - so yes those are the things not cursor
59:26 - pointer though that's not the difference
59:28 - but yeah those are the differences okay
59:29 - so we need to make it
59:31 - smaller size
59:32 - we need to give it this border radius
59:35 - right so we need to do all of those
59:36 - things
59:37 - so let's get to work on it
59:41 - and the color too so somebody caught
59:43 - that good job on that
59:45 - all right so let's go ahead and style
59:47 - this alright so let's go to header css
59:51 - and here's how we're going to do this
59:53 - right so header
59:55 - items we did it now we need to style our
59:58 - header actions so let's go ahead and
60:00 - let's do header actions
60:01 - and we'll say display flex
60:04 - all right and i'll give it a line item
60:07 - center
60:09 - okay so
60:10 - we just centered it and everything and
60:13 - so that's that's good enough right there
60:15 - okay
60:17 - um and then we're gonna use the same
60:19 - hack for this as well header actions
60:21 - because i need to still add in one more
60:23 - thing so we'll give it a margin of 10
60:25 - pixels here
60:26 - okay so that basically what that will do
60:29 - is when i add in the button here it'll
60:31 - give spacing in between that button
60:35 - and the moon
60:38 - theme switch icon
60:40 - all right so now we're going to get to
60:41 - work on the theme switch container
60:46 - and in here we're going to start off by
60:48 - doing display flex
60:51 - okay let's give it a background color
60:56 - and this background color is going to be
60:58 - the 1c1c1e
61:01 - that we gave earlier so let's go see all
61:03 - right can you guys see that little um
61:06 - like gray background like the square one
61:09 - are you guys able to see it
61:11 - yeah okay i'm seeing some heads nodding
61:14 - okay good you guys can see it awesome
61:17 - 144 yeah the number is dropping keep an
61:20 - eye on that the deeper we go into this
61:22 - it keeps dropping
61:23 - it's still not as bad though so that's
61:25 - that's pretty good i got to give you
61:26 - guys props a lot of you are like
61:29 - championing through this a good job on
61:30 - that so yeah this that's what we got now
61:33 - how do we make that circular does
61:35 - anybody have any idea
61:37 - yes gerardo you're on the money great
61:39 - work buddy border radius and i'll just
61:42 - give it a 50
61:44 - pixel border radius here
61:47 - all right so there we go we got that
61:48 - circle
61:49 - now notice right this circle has so much
61:52 - spacing around it yet this circle has no
61:55 - spacing
61:56 - and what i mean is
61:59 - the logo right is there's a lot of
62:01 - distance between
62:02 - here
62:03 - there's no distance between the logo and
62:05 - the circle like they're touching each
62:07 - other how do we fix that
62:11 - yes padding if if
62:14 - i know a few of you guys are going to be
62:15 - here and you're going to be like how the
62:17 - hell does everybody know every answer
62:19 - and i feel like i don't do you feel like
62:21 - that right now is there anybody that
62:23 - feels like that right now like how come
62:25 - everybody knows all these answers
62:27 - um
62:28 - crystal yeah
62:30 - don't let these fools intimidate you
62:32 - they've just spent more time sucking at
62:34 - coding and failing more than you okay
62:36 - that's all that's all that has happened
62:38 - they're not any different than you
62:39 - they're not smarter than you i freaking
62:41 - promise you they've just
62:43 - banged their heads against the wall more
62:46 - than you they've cried more tears than
62:48 - you
62:49 - coding failing and things breaking
62:52 - and and that's all okay so don't take it
62:55 - as a thing of you're dumber than them or
62:57 - whatever that that's not what it is
62:59 - okay
63:00 - just want to put that out there for
63:02 - everybody
63:04 - okay cool
63:06 - so we got the padding that's good
63:09 - now we need to centralize everything so
63:11 - we're going to go justify content and
63:13 - i'm going to center it let's go align
63:15 - items and center it align items
63:18 - vertically centers things justify
63:19 - content horizontally centers things
63:23 - the other thing i want to say is object
63:25 - fit
63:26 - contain this will like contain the image
63:29 - and make it look a lot nicer okay so
63:32 - we'll show you guys that in just a
63:34 - second so we got object fit contain
63:37 - we got the border radius on this thing
63:39 - okay cool
63:41 - and then we want to like make the image
63:43 - smaller here okay so let's go ahead
63:45 - let's grab it let's grab the image so
63:48 - let's go after that specificity that
63:49 - taylor
63:50 - chris likes okay
63:52 - and we'll go height and we'll go 25
63:55 - pixels
63:56 - and if we go back
63:58 - what is happening here boom there we go
64:01 - right

65:23 - in real quick so let's go back to our
65:25 - header
65:26 - okay
65:28 - and let me ask you guys this is this
65:30 - button we're gonna add is this gonna go
65:31 - inside of the header or it's gonna go
65:33 - outside of the header
65:36 - quick question not trying to trick you
65:40 - okay so far we've put the logo container
65:42 - inside of the header the search bar
65:44 - inside of the header the search input
65:46 - inside of the header header items inside
65:48 - of the header header actions inside of
65:50 - the header
65:51 - is this gonna go inside or outside
65:57 - okay it's gonna go inside okay
66:00 - just because all of this remember
66:02 - earlier i told you guys it's part of the
66:03 - header if you got it wrong it's all good
66:06 - isaiah says i can understand what you're
66:07 - doing but i can't keep up it's all good
66:08 - bro i'm gonna be i'm telling you guys
66:10 - i'm gonna be going fast and it's gonna
66:12 - get faster than this
66:14 - uh just because i want to cover it all
66:16 - in a you know short enough time span
66:19 - because i don't want you guys to be here
66:20 - for six hours right like you guys don't
66:22 - want to be here for six hours straight
66:26 - cool
66:27 - so um all right so let's uh work on that
66:31 - let's add that in
66:33 - so we'll go right here
66:36 - and we'll say
66:38 - we'll go div right there
66:42 - all right and this divs class name let
66:45 - me ask you guys
66:47 - over here this is the login button okay
66:50 - this is what we're calling the login
66:52 - button so what will the class name be
66:56 - what will the class name be
67:00 - login button exactly any of those works
67:04 - all right and we're just going to add
67:05 - the text that says get in
67:07 - that's it
67:09 - let's go get in
67:11 - now let's take a look at it you guys see
67:13 - this button showing up here it says get
67:15 - in
67:17 - yeah
67:17 - okay so right now it's not a it's just a
67:20 - div with some text in it so we'll make
67:22 - it look like a button and and and do
67:24 - things like a button okay so let's go
67:26 - ahead and do that let's go to our
67:28 - header.css again
67:30 - and we're going to get to styling here
67:32 - and i'm going to say dot login button
67:36 - and we'll grab the background
67:39 - and we'll give it a gradient
67:41 - and it's going to be a gradient from
67:42 - left to right
67:44 - and let's give it a
67:47 - greener
67:48 - cyan here
67:51 - 5 9 f9 b7 and then we're going to give
67:54 - it
67:55 - more of a normal cyan at the end so
67:58 - we'll go
67:59 - 6 6 f e a
68:02 - okay so it's going to go from this like
68:03 - greener to cyan so let's go here let's
68:06 - refresh
68:08 - you guys see that you guys see that
68:10 - little gradient popping in there
68:12 - okay another question so why i'm
68:15 - constantly asking you guys these
68:16 - questions i'm trying to engage your
68:18 - brain even if you're not coding
68:21 - if you just keep answering these
68:22 - questions it'll be like you're pretty
68:24 - much coding and the more pattern
68:26 - recognition i can drill into your
68:28 - freaking heads you're going to become
68:30 - better developers because a lot of this
68:31 - is not intelligence it's pattern
68:33 - recognition so a lot of people are
68:36 - answering this aren't because they're
68:37 - solving this they've seen this time and
68:40 - again and they just like remember what
68:42 - needs to be done so
68:44 - remember last time when we needed
68:47 - because these things were so close
68:49 - we needed to give a distance between
68:50 - them right well guess what we need to do
68:52 - that again here because the get is too
68:55 - close to the edges the corners so how do
68:59 - we make this box bigger
69:02 - and make it so there's like more spacing
69:04 - and so the get in is away from the edges
69:07 - whenever i say it's like pushing away
69:09 - from the edges or making it bigger
69:11 - there's one word it starts with the p it
69:13 - should just be coming to your head so
69:15 - freaking fast
69:16 - beautiful up yeah padding padding
69:19 - padding love okay good you love the reps
69:21 - great so just say padding just type it
69:24 - in it will like neuro transmitters will
69:27 - start firing in your brain you'll start
69:28 - making that connection
69:30 - all right so just let's just go here
69:33 - right we'll say padding
69:35 - and we'll give it a certain padding in
69:37 - this case we'll give it like a y-axis
69:39 - padding so 15 pixels
69:41 - and then a x-axis padding okay meaning
69:46 - vertical and horizontal okay so let's go
69:48 - take a look at it again there we go
69:52 - you guys see that
69:54 - all right now with all this padding
69:56 - added all we need to do is make it
69:58 - circular so like let me ask you this
70:00 - whenever you want to round things off
70:02 - this is another pattern that just always
70:04 - keeps coming up whenever you want to
70:05 - round things
70:07 - round things round things right there
70:09 - it's a b word that should be coming to
70:11 - your mind okay every single time
70:14 - b word the initials are br
70:17 - quickly write that in write that in
70:19 - drill it drill it drill it drill it
70:21 - drill it
70:22 - awesome
70:24 - yup great job so border radius if you've
70:27 - said it right that's what actually gives
70:29 - it what you're looking for so let's go
70:31 - ahead and give it that we'll go border
70:33 - radius and we'll go 50 pixels just like
70:36 - this let's go back
70:38 - boom guys
70:39 - is it just me or that looks nice
70:44 - okay what's the only difference between
70:46 - this get in and this get in
70:50 - okay what's the main difference don't
70:51 - worry about the padding difference
70:54 - or don't worry about like the little
70:55 - distance that they have
70:58 - what's the main difference here
71:00 - font color yes yes yes yes yes text is
71:03 - darker good job so we're going to go
71:05 - color
71:06 - and we'll go black
71:08 - okay
71:09 - and
71:10 - that will do it we got get it get in now
71:13 - and it's darker
71:14 - and

76:19 - we're just gonna call it whatever we
76:20 - want it's gonna be a random div okay
76:23 - and we're just gonna store it there but
76:25 - you know maybe let's just write title
76:26 - here for for our sake okay
76:30 - or or let's just call it name
76:32 - all right what else are we going to have
76:36 - we're going to have a number right we're
76:38 - going to have the pricing of it
76:40 - okay so we're going to have definitely
76:42 - something that's going to be
76:44 - related to the price which is going to
76:46 - be you know this is true and stuff but
76:48 - if you look at this this is 37 this is
76:51 - 23
76:52 - so normally it's going to just be the
76:54 - pricing okay so that true is kind of a
76:57 - random one
76:58 - but
76:59 - let's actually go here
77:01 - so this is going to be price
77:04 - okay
77:04 - and then what else is it made up of
77:07 - can you guys see any other images
77:09 - besides this does anybody spot any other
77:12 - images in there
77:14 - good job isaac nice work
77:16 - great work
77:18 - yes so we got our eth image okay so
77:21 - here's another image
77:25 - cool and you guys can probably already
77:27 - start to guess that this image is going
77:29 - to need to be styled a certain way
77:31 - meaning otherwise like it's going to be
77:33 - huge but it's really tiny here so when
77:36 - it's tiny here you can already start to
77:38 - guess that there's going to be some
77:39 - styling going on right
77:41 - this image right here there's gonna be
77:43 - some styling going on here because look
77:45 - the sizes between this and this are
77:47 - different
77:49 - uh there's this border radius here
77:51 - there's some styling going on there so
77:53 - already start to keep these things in
77:54 - mind
77:55 - okay as we go through this
77:57 - cool
77:58 - so let's put an image
78:00 - and for this image here
78:03 - i will
78:04 - let's see what we need to do okay
78:08 - so for the new wallet that i created
78:11 - right
78:13 - can i copy image address and paste it
78:16 - let's see if that works
78:17 - oh cool
78:18 - okay that works
78:20 - let's go to open c
78:22 - and i will take my wallet address
78:26 - and uh let's see if that shows up on
78:29 - openc
78:30 - can i type that in
78:33 - nice
78:34 - so you guys see all the crypto all the
78:36 - nfts that i've made are now showing up
78:38 - on openc and i can actually see what
78:40 - they're showing for so this is public
78:42 - information
78:43 - you know if you guys wanted to go here
78:44 - you could
78:45 - i'll drop the link
78:48 - here for all of you
78:51 - okay
78:54 - i'll drop the link right there so you
78:56 - guys can actually go and see my
78:57 - collection
78:58 - okay uh you guys should favorite some of
79:01 - these whichever one is your favorite
79:02 - favorite it i'd love to see it
79:05 - let's see if somebody's already in here
79:08 - oh man
79:09 - actually i don't think it's gonna show
79:11 - me your guys's favorite it right i don't
79:14 - think it works like that
79:17 - yeah i don't think it works like that
79:18 - never mind i thought it was gonna show
79:20 - me your guys's favorites
79:22 - oh wow we got a one dollar donation
79:24 - thank you so much evan really appreciate
79:26 - it
79:28 - thank you brother much love
79:31 - okay
79:32 - awesome so
79:33 - we got these guys right here
79:35 - that's
79:36 - that's all good
79:39 - okay
79:40 - now let's start so i got that image
79:43 - address
79:44 - right
79:46 - and that's the image we're gonna use at
79:48 - some point okay for now i'm just going
79:49 - to put image right here
79:51 - and this collection card is going to
79:53 - take in a couple of things as props it's
79:56 - going to take in an id it's going to
79:57 - take a name
79:59 - it's going to take in let's say some
80:01 - traits and it's going to take in an
80:03 - image
80:05 - okay
80:06 - we'll go right there and i'll go class
80:09 - name
80:09 - details okay
80:11 - these details will contain some of the
80:13 - details that we're going to pass
80:16 - we're also going to give a name
80:18 - right so remember when we were building
80:21 - it out i showed you guys that there's
80:23 - going to be a name right here
80:25 - right so the class name of this div here
80:27 - is going to be name just like this
80:30 - okay
80:31 - and inside of here it's going to be the
80:33 - name
80:35 - and then next to the name if you guys
80:37 - noticed
80:38 - we have another thing which is the
80:41 - uh the actual id
80:44 - and this id
80:45 - is being you know
80:47 - uh basically they're pulled from here or
80:49 - we're just incrementing it manually
80:51 - ourselves but this id is correlating
80:53 - with each of the punks okay
80:58 - so
80:59 - let's go ahead and make this div
81:02 - this class name of this is going to be
81:04 - id
81:07 - and it's going to have this
81:10 - right here that will actually grab this
81:12 - dot
81:14 - okay i think you can do it with um
81:21 - i don't know the shortcut for it is
81:23 - but you could put a daughter an asterisk
81:26 - i mean either one is fine or you don't
81:27 - even need to put any of that there you
81:29 - could just do it regularly like without
81:31 - it you could just do it like this
81:32 - and like you could remove that that's
81:34 - fine too it'll still look good
81:37 - this dot right here is coming from the
81:39 - fact that we put that dot right there
81:42 - right this
81:43 - hashtag is representing that hashtag
81:45 - right there and this id that we're
81:47 - pulling
81:48 - is representing this id right here okay
81:53 - cool let's go down here now we're going
81:55 - to build out our price container
81:58 - so go class name and i'll go price
82:01 - container
82:05 - and we'll put our images in here
82:08 - so
82:09 - this will be called this will be our
82:11 - ethereum image
82:14 - all right and then the class name here
82:18 - is going to be
82:20 - image like this
82:22 - weak image or eth image either one is
82:24 - fine
82:26 - okay and then we're going to put um
82:30 - our price
82:32 - here
82:33 - okay
82:36 - and i'll show you guys how to get the
82:37 - price kind of dynamically as well okay
82:40 - in just a second
82:43 - but yeah so this is what we have when it
82:44 - comes to the collection card
82:46 - now what we need to do is uh be able to
82:49 - show it okay so here let's let's
82:50 - actually finish this out so let's go
82:52 - traits
82:54 - of zero
82:57 - and uh dot value
83:00 - so i'll show you guys once we pull the
83:02 - data from openc
83:04 - all right we're going to pass it in
83:06 - and we'll have something called traits
83:09 - all right inside of the traits we'll
83:11 - have
83:12 - access to all all of our traits meaning
83:15 - we'll have access to this
83:18 - okay
83:18 - properties is just another word for
83:20 - traits that we're using
83:24 - cool
83:26 - so now this collection card thing that
83:29 - we have
83:30 - let's go ahead and put it on app.js so
83:32 - i'm going to go to app.js here and i'll
83:34 - say collection
83:36 - card
83:37 - and it auto imported for me from there
83:40 - okay and it says weed is not defined and
83:43 - it's just because we have to import it
83:44 - so i'm going to say import
83:46 - weath from
83:49 - assets slash width.png
83:53 - okay beautiful
83:54 - now
83:55 - going back to the collection card we
83:57 - need to give it a couple of props so we
83:59 - have to give it an id and i'll just give
84:01 - it an idea of zero
84:04 - okay we'll give it an idea of zero
84:06 - what else do we need to give it guys so
84:07 - we gave it an id there's four things
84:09 - what else do we need to give it
84:12 - any guesses we gave it an id
84:14 - the next thing is yes
84:16 - name
84:18 - all right so for name
84:20 - i'll just write bandana
84:23 - punk
84:26 - okay let's put it as string
84:30 - what else after name yes good job isaac
84:33 - good job
84:34 - joe good job jehu good job crystal
84:36 - traits
84:37 - so we'll give it traits
84:40 - now traits is going to be the only one
84:42 - that's going to look slightly confusing
84:44 - and we'll have a value
84:47 - of let's say
84:48 - 7 eth
84:51 - okay so
84:52 - it's an array
84:55 - with an object inside of it okay and
84:58 - then the last thing we're going to give
85:00 - it is an image
85:03 - okay so right now the crypto punk image
85:05 - is not showing up so here i'll just go
85:09 - image
85:10 - okay and i'll i'll give it that like
85:12 - crazy link
85:14 - that um
85:19 - that i got earlier for the nft labs one
85:21 - right so i'll just paste that link right
85:24 - there boom there we go
85:26 - so collection card gave it an id gave it
85:28 - a name give it traits give it an image
85:31 - and you can see that it's showing up
85:34 - okay it's not looking the best
85:37 - right
85:38 - here you can actually even see it says
85:40 - bandanna punk
85:42 - right you can see that but it's black
85:44 - right now
85:45 - and then and then you can even see it
85:47 - says um
85:49 - zero just like we wanted it so saying
85:51 - all of the things but
85:53 - is this styled how we want it right it's
85:56 - not
85:57 - probably you would say not even close
86:00 - so now we need to fix this right we need
86:04 - to actually change this
86:08 - so let's go ahead and uh let's style our
86:11 - collection card
86:12 - so now
86:13 - you guys have seen the pattern
86:15 - when we created header that was to add
86:17 - the component but then when we wanted to
86:19 - style it we created header.css
86:22 - we added the functionality of collection
86:24 - uh card now we need to style it so what
86:27 - do what are we going to need to do guys
86:29 - what file do we need to create
86:33 - awesome job samir codes just dropped the
86:35 - donation five dollars thank you so much
86:38 - and he says you're doing awesome thank
86:40 - you for inspiring me to become a web
86:41 - developer beautiful brother happy to
86:43 - hear that that is amazing
86:46 - yes good job collection.css or
86:49 - collectioncard.css
86:51 - exactly we're going to keep the names
86:52 - almost the same here okay so i'll just
86:54 - show you here
86:56 - good job you guys are doing great so
86:58 - let's go collectioncard.css
87:01 - like this
87:04 - okay and in here i'm gonna go collection
87:06 - card
87:08 - and uh we'll go color
87:10 - white
87:14 - okay
87:15 - cool
87:16 - now
87:19 - we do need to import it that's why the
87:21 - styling is not showing up so we're going
87:22 - to go import
87:24 - or not not in app.js i'm sorry let's go
87:26 - back to collection.js here
87:29 - and let's go
87:30 - import right and what am i going to
87:32 - import
87:33 - how am i going to import this
87:36 - what's going to be the line that i write
87:37 - here
87:40 - import what
87:42 - dot slash
87:45 - yes good job collection
87:48 - collectioncard.css okay it's this
87:50 - specific file right here that i'm
87:52 - importing and now do you guys see that
87:54 - that styling is already being applied
87:56 - the text font that i just made white is
87:58 - showing up
88:02 - okay
88:04 - beautiful
88:05 - so
88:06 - let's go background to color on this
88:09 - and we'll give it one a one c one e on
88:12 - this okay so now you should see this
88:16 - grayish background color pop up over
88:18 - here
88:19 - we'll give it a border radius
88:22 - of 20
88:24 - pixels
88:26 - okay
88:27 - so the border radius will start showing
88:29 - up i mean right now it's like super huge
88:31 - so it's like hard to kind of see what's
88:32 - going on but once we start controlling
88:35 - its size like you see the border radius
88:37 - is showing up right there you guys see
88:38 - that
88:39 - right there
88:44 - we gotta tame this beast let's go
88:46 - overflow
88:48 - hidden on this thing let's give it a
88:51 - width of 300 pixels
88:54 - okay there we go starting to get more
88:56 - and more control now right
88:58 - there we go so like the card is
89:01 - is the width-wise is starting to look
89:03 - good now we have to control its height
89:05 - because the height is still too much
89:10 - okay that starts controlling the height
89:12 - a lot more
89:14 - and now we got to give it margin
89:17 - right 30 pixels
89:20 - okay
89:21 - and another thing we got to do is we got
89:23 - to grab the image and we got to make
89:26 - sure it's 100
89:29 - there we go okay
89:32 - so now
89:33 - we're starting to see it we got the
89:35 - border radius
89:37 - right we got this action going on the
89:40 - split
89:42 - the eth image is still huge
89:44 - so we're going to need to do something
89:45 - about that
89:47 - let's actually do something about it
89:49 - right away so let's
89:50 - go uh
89:52 - image
89:53 - and we'll go height give it 23.
89:57 - okay and with we'll give it 50 pixels
90:00 - here
90:01 - oh my goodness girardo thank you so much
90:04 - brother wow gerardo just donated 10
90:09 - thank you gerardo really freaking
90:11 - appreciate it
90:13 - thank you thank you thank you thank you

90:18 - front end mastery boot camp thank you so
90:20 - much for the love gerard i really
90:21 - appreciate it
90:23 - um
90:25 - that's our coding bootcamp that a lot of
90:27 - students go to and we help them become
90:30 - developers in 90 days to 120 days so
90:33 - that's something you're interested in
90:34 - you want to get that result hit us up
90:36 - and let me know
90:38 - okay with that said let's keep rocking
90:39 - and rolling i swear i didn't pay him to
90:42 - pay me to say that
90:45 - he just
90:46 - he did it of his own accord
90:50 - um okay cool so we got the image kind of
90:53 - under control that's what we wanted
90:55 - let's get the pricing to be to look good
90:58 - as well we'll give it some margin left
91:01 - 5 pixels and i'll give it a font weight
91:04 - of 600
91:07 - okay
91:08 - for naught weight font wait
91:10 - there we go
91:13 - okay so now you can see the seven is
91:15 - showing up a lot more clearly right
91:17 - there right
91:18 - cool now let's uh put the price
91:20 - container that we had let's style that
91:24 - we'll do display flex everything shows
91:26 - up in a row
91:28 - yeah just like this boom
91:32 - and then let's go ahead and i'll go
91:34 - align item center on that thing
91:36 - we will go
91:38 - margin
91:40 - top 10 pixels
91:42 - and then we're gonna go object fit
91:44 - contain so everything just looks super
91:46 - crispy
91:47 - okay
91:49 - beautiful
91:52 - now the details portion let's
91:55 - make that look a little bit better too
91:57 - i'll give it a padding of 20 pixels
91:59 - amazing
92:02 - name so we want to make this part here
92:05 - big right like that's the title part
92:08 - that you guys were talking about so
92:09 - let's go
92:10 - and give it a bigger font size
92:12 - and we'll give it a bigger font weight
92:15 - as well that's going to make it like
92:18 - bold and pop out
92:21 - cool
92:23 - now
92:24 - the id we want to give it a different
92:26 - color
92:27 - okay
92:28 - so let's go a1 a5 b0 on this bad boy
92:33 - so that's such a beautiful color
92:34 - actually
92:35 - go font size 18 pixels so slightly
92:38 - smaller on the font size and then let's
92:40 - also make the font weight slightly
92:43 - less as well
92:45 - okay
92:46 - fantastic
92:49 - so with that said i mean the card
92:52 - you know is looking pretty good the only
92:54 - difference right now is it's too close
92:56 - to the edges
92:58 - so let's go ahead and fix that
93:01 - margin left here
93:06 - okay
93:07 - let's see
93:11 - that looks good to me
93:14 - that looks good to me
93:20 - mm-hmm
93:26 - hmm
93:27 - just a little bit closer here okay let's
93:29 - see what's happening so let's go back
93:32 - to our collection card
93:38 - yes price container
93:41 - [Music]
93:50 - oh my details my details are off yeah
93:53 - yeah yeah i'm just opening it and kind
93:55 - of closing it right there that's not
93:57 - right i think uh
93:59 - details need to close
94:04 - a bit actually
94:07 - details needs to close that whole thing
94:12 - there we go
94:14 - uh details closes lower than that right
94:17 - yes perfect thank you david i appreciate
94:20 - you yeah yeah
94:21 - i was just about to head there okay
94:22 - appreciate that awesome so yeah because
94:24 - we added the padding to details right if
94:27 - you see it here we added the padding to
94:29 - details
94:30 - so that's what allowed that to happen
94:33 - and again remember the pattern guys
94:34 - remember what we said when things get
94:36 - too close to each other the pattern is
94:39 - most of the times padding so start
94:42 - remembering that
94:43 - with that said i think now this card is
94:47 - looking awesome i mean how does this
94:49 - card look guys you guys like how this
94:51 - card looks
94:53 - i mean look at this thing
94:56 - you guys i if you've been following this
94:58 - so far right we're almost getting to the
95:01 - end of this app wow we're at 145 people
95:03 - on zoom the retention is crazy you guys
95:06 - are on fire
95:08 - already looking snazzy looks great looks
95:12 - good yes
95:14 - amazing you guys are on fire awesome i
95:17 - mean on even on youtube we're almost at
95:18 - 300 people so great that's awesome and
95:21 - by the way if you're watching us on
95:22 - youtube smash that like button
95:25 - turn that thing blue so this video just
95:27 - keeps going out to more and more people
95:29 - helps out a ton
95:31 - okay so the card looks absolutely
95:33 - fantastic and now what we need to do
95:36 - guys is we need to make a bunch of these
95:38 - cards okay it's not just like
95:42 - the few that we have here we want to be
95:45 - able to essentially like loop through it
95:48 - right and then have a bunch of these
95:50 - cards
95:52 - show up so what we're going to do is
95:53 - we're going to make another component
95:55 - and we're going to call that component
95:59 - could you guess
96:02 - actually before we make this other
96:04 - component
96:05 - all right yes some javascript is coming
96:07 - up exactly get ready for it let's
96:09 - actually start pulling the data i think
96:11 - i'm kind of itching to pull the data
96:14 - from
96:15 - open c and start using it so let's go to
96:18 - our app
96:20 - and let's pull some data and we're going
96:22 - to start using some uh
96:24 - some fancy schmancy stuff here too so
96:27 - get ready
96:30 - i wanna get
96:32 - use state and i wanna get use effect
96:36 - and here's where i get it from you state
96:39 - use effect
96:41 - from react and i'll explain why i'm
96:43 - getting this here's where i'm getting
96:44 - this
96:45 - i want to pull all the data from openc
96:50 - i want to pull all of these from open c
96:54 - and i want to store this
96:57 - in
96:58 - in a variable so i have access to all of
97:01 - this like in an array right and so in
97:03 - order to do that with react i need to
97:05 - use use state
97:06 - and also to pull this data and make a
97:09 - api request i need to use
97:13 - use effect
97:14 - okay
97:17 - so that's why i got those two
97:21 - the other thing we're going to do is
97:22 - we're going to do yarn add axios so just
97:25 - install that or you can do npm install
97:27 - axios i'll write that here if you didn't
97:30 - see that because i might have went
97:31 - through too quick so just you
97:33 - yarn add axios or if you're not as cool
97:37 - do npm
97:39 - install
97:40 - axios
97:43 - okay both
97:44 - both ways will work all right i just
97:46 - like yarn more because it's way better
97:49 - um so yeah cool
97:52 - so now that you have axios installed you
97:55 - can do import axios from axios
98:01 - okay
98:02 - just like this
98:06 - perfect
98:08 - and uh now we're getting ready to make
98:11 - an api call
98:13 - you guys excited gonna make an api call
98:15 - it's gonna get real dynamic lots of
98:18 - javascript action going on here
98:20 - yes alicia's palm she's like yes let's
98:24 - go
98:25 - we're gonna be using async away joe
98:27 - absolutely you're right good job
98:31 - all right here we go so we're going to
98:33 - go and
98:34 - create a bucket of punk list data and
98:37 - then we're going to do set punk list
98:38 - data and start it off with an empty
98:40 - array nice and easy okay everything is
98:42 - nice and easy this variable here we're
98:46 - going to store all of our punks right in
98:49 - there okay
98:51 - now we need to do use effect
98:54 - because we're about to make our api call
98:57 - it's gonna not have any dependencies to
98:59 - put that empty bracket there
99:03 - uh and here's what we're gonna do
99:05 - oh this is nice david
99:08 - it's uh auto writing some nice code for
99:10 - me that i bet works
99:12 - okay here's what we're going to do we're
99:14 - going to do
99:15 - get my nfts i'm going to make a function
99:18 - this is going to be an async
99:24 - function all right
99:27 - and we'll do a wait and get the data
99:29 - from axios
99:38 - yeah oh yeah rom that that github
99:42 - autopilot is just too freaking strong
99:46 - now this is where you're gonna get gets
99:47 - uh slightly tricky so follow along with
99:50 - me as i write this out okay so we're
99:52 - going to do https
99:54 - colon slash
99:56 - uh can we drop this link somewhere david
99:59 - so people could get this link
100:01 - i think could be helpful just the base
100:03 - link
100:04 - openc dot io slash
100:06 - assets and then we will do asset
100:11 - contract
100:14 - oh sorry asset contract underscore
100:16 - address equals
100:18 - and this address is basically going to
100:20 - be my third web wallet
100:23 - so i'm going to copy this
100:28 - and i will paste it right there
100:32 - okay
100:32 - and we will do
100:34 - order underscore direction is equal to
100:37 - ascending
100:38 - okay so this should get me all of mine
100:40 - in ascending order
100:41 - okay
100:42 - and then the last thing i want to do
100:44 - here is just do console.log openc
100:47 - data.data.assets
100:50 - all right cool
100:52 - now it will crash for me in just a
100:55 - second
100:56 - i'll
100:58 - i'll avoid the crash
101:06 - okay here we go
101:11 - let's hit inspect
101:13 - said console
101:20 - console.log
101:27 - okay refresh
101:34 - oh wait axios oh i'm not returning this
101:37 - function yes so let's let's call the
101:40 - function actually because i never called
101:41 - it
101:42 - so return get my nfts let's hit refresh
101:47 - so inspect
101:49 - there we go
101:50 - so you can see i get an array
101:59 - huh this array is empty interesting
102:05 - refresh
102:07 - okay i'm probably putting in my
102:11 - test nets
102:13 - dash
102:18 - assets
102:20 - assets question mark asset contract
102:22 - address
102:30 - am i putting in the wrong address i
102:31 - don't think so
102:33 - you're putting in
102:36 - the
102:37 - wait which which link is that
102:39 - this right here i'm grabbing my wall no
102:42 - not that no no it's the uh collection ah
102:44 - yes yes yes okay nice thank you so my
102:47 - bad guys sorry so this is the collection
102:49 - you gotta copy this not the wallet okay
102:52 - this is the collection you gotta get
102:54 - not this
102:57 - copy
103:00 - um
103:01 - double click paste
103:06 - okay there we go now i got access to all
103:09 - six of my
103:12 - little beautiful nfts
103:15 - okay if you actually look through here
103:19 - i'll try to zoom in
103:22 - you'll be able to see you know image
103:24 - thumbnail url
103:26 - you can see things like uh who the owner
103:28 - is
103:29 - and uh you could see traits right traits
103:32 - has a price
103:34 - and you can see value 13
103:37 - representing 13 eth for example
103:40 - okay
103:41 - so
103:43 - let's go back up so it looks like i'm
103:46 - actually getting access to my data now i
103:48 - just need to store this
103:52 - and thank you
103:55 - right there okay so that that line that
103:57 - i just wrote thanks to copilot
104:01 - i'm basically saying set punchless data
104:03 - to whatever data that i got back okay so
104:05 - i'm just storing that in here
104:09 - cool
104:13 - now that i have all the information
104:15 - about every single punk
104:19 - i can actually start to pass it around
104:21 - let me go to my collection card
104:23 - and why is this showing up here that's
104:25 - interesting
104:28 - no idea
104:29 - i don't know how that got there okay
104:33 - so
104:34 - i'm getting access to all my data now
104:37 - we'll actually create our
104:39 - other component guys so what's this
104:41 - component called the component that
104:44 - contains all the collection cards what
104:46 - are we going to call that component you

106:02 - appreciate it
106:03 - all right
106:05 - so
106:07 - now we're gonna build the what guys
106:09 - that's sorry i got distracted we are
106:12 - going to do
106:13 - our freaking
106:15 - um
106:16 - punk list okay there we go goo gan good
106:20 - job we're gonna create our
106:22 - punk
106:23 - punk
106:24 - list all right so
106:28 - i want to start off
106:30 - it's a component right so where am i
106:32 - going to put this
106:33 - which folder am i going to create this
106:35 - file in and what's the file going to be
106:38 - called can you guys guess
106:40 - it's going to be in the components
106:41 - folder
106:42 - and it's going to be called
106:44 - punklist.js
106:47 - i'm going to rf rfce this bad boy hit
106:51 - tab
106:52 - watch the magic happen
106:58 - okay
106:59 - perfect
107:00 - now here's what i need to do in here i
107:03 - know a couple of things about punk list
107:04 - it's going to get access to the punk
107:06 - list data and i know that well for now
107:10 - we'll just leave this as is like this
107:13 - okay
107:14 - and it's going to return
107:17 - class name what's the class name going
107:18 - to be can you guys guess for the punk
107:20 - list component can you guess the class
107:22 - name
107:25 - yes it's going to be punk list
107:28 - all right
107:29 - now inside of here
107:31 - we're going to map through this
107:34 - okay
107:36 - and we don't need access to the index
107:41 - and for each punk i'm gonna do the
107:45 - following
107:47 - my dog is going crazy my english bulldog
107:51 - i'm going to make a div
107:54 - okay
107:56 - and i'm going to leave it empty for now
107:58 - and inside of this div
108:00 - we're going to do our collection card
108:02 - component so remember we're literally
108:04 - looping through and co and creating the
108:07 - collection card over and over again
108:09 - uh does that make sense or did i lose
108:11 - you guys there
108:12 - because punk list is going to be this
108:14 - big thing
108:15 - and all it's going to do is just going
108:16 - to loop through and build this
108:18 - collection card component then build
108:19 - this collection card component and build
108:21 - this collection card component and each
108:23 - time it's going to get like the specific
108:26 - information it needs to build that
108:27 - collection card component
108:30 - okay so that's what's happening
108:36 - collection card
108:38 - okay
108:39 - self-closing tag it's gonna have a
108:41 - couple of things that it's gonna take
108:43 - so we're gonna give it a key and it's
108:45 - going to take the punk token id
108:48 - we're going to give it a punk token id
108:51 - for its id as well for name we're going
108:54 - to give it punk dot name
108:56 - for traits okay can you guess the
108:58 - patterns what am i going to write here
109:00 - it's going to be what
109:02 - punk
109:03 - dot what
109:05 - dot traits
109:08 - okay
109:10 - for the image what is it going to be if
109:12 - you can even guess close you're good for
109:15 - image what am i gonna write
109:16 - if you can look at this pattern punk dot
109:18 - something punk dot something pong dot
109:20 - name punk dot traits it's gonna be what
109:23 - yes very yeah good job everybody who
109:26 - says something with punk dot image
109:27 - you're on the right track okay so it's
109:29 - just going to be punk
109:30 - dot image
109:32 - underscore original
109:34 - underscore url and where this is coming
109:36 - from if you're like what the heck i just
109:38 - thought it's going to be image
109:39 - um it's okay you're not supposed you
109:41 - don't have information of this just yet
109:43 - but it's coming from here
109:46 - uh image
109:48 - underscore original underscore url
109:50 - okay so i have to follow that pattern
109:52 - there
109:56 - okay beautiful
109:58 - so we're we're good on this
110:01 - so all that's happening is once we get
110:03 - all of our data from open c
110:05 - we put it in this variable punk list
110:07 - data our pink list component gets to
110:10 - work loops over
110:13 - and for every single punk um inside of
110:16 - the punchless data
110:18 - it builds it using collection cards
110:22 - using the collection card component so
110:24 - let's see it in action let's go to punk
110:26 - uh let's go to app dot blah blah blah
110:30 - and let's go punk
110:32 - list
110:33 - all right and give it punk list data
110:36 - and let's see if it builds it out whoa
110:39 - it worked on the first try baby let's go
110:43 - uh very rare that that happens but i'm
110:45 - really happy that it worked on the first
110:46 - try because there's a lot of coding that
110:49 - we did there
110:52 - yeah so you guys see how that's
110:53 - happening right super freaking cool we
110:55 - took it from the console
110:57 - yeah where's the blowhorn seriously
111:00 - [Music]
111:01 - i mean
111:02 - literally every freaking thing except
111:04 - for the blowhorn i'm sorry guys
111:07 - [Music]
111:09 - i guess you're just gonna have to live
111:11 - with the with that one that's the best
111:14 - that's the best one we got
111:17 - sounds like nasa
111:23 - in honor of
111:25 - oh man

111:31 - [Music]
111:32 - okay cool
111:34 - yeah
111:36 - seriously
111:37 - okay so now we don't need this
111:39 - hard-coded data right good call whoever
111:41 - said that we don't need that hard-coded
111:43 - data i removed it
111:46 - now a couple of things quick question
111:48 - it's showing up in a column hmm
111:52 - if only there was a way to put it all in
111:55 - a row
111:57 - how do we do that guys
112:01 - yes sir
112:03 - oh and man
112:05 - okay y'all got it good job that's
112:07 - exactly right we're gonna have to
112:10 - flex this thing okay
112:12 - now another question
112:14 - we're gonna need to style right the punk
112:17 - list component i wonder how are we gonna
112:20 - start styling it are we just gonna go in
112:22 - this js file and start styling it right
112:24 - here just boom like right right here in
112:27 - the face is this what we're gonna be
112:28 - doing right now what are we gonna be
112:30 - doing guys
112:32 - yes if you guys got the pattern it's
112:34 - gonna be a css file and it's gonna be in
112:37 - here and it's gonna be called what
112:40 - punk list dot css
112:46 - good job guys you got it nice work
112:52 - man cough needs to just go away
112:56 - here we go so let's get to work boys and
112:59 - girls
113:00 - punk list
113:02 - okay
113:02 - first of all we're gonna make the
113:04 - cursor's pointer now let's go back to
113:06 - punk list the styling is not working
113:08 - styling is not working the cursor is not
113:11 - turning into a pointer causing
113:13 - what's wrong why is this not working
113:17 - what do we need to do
113:19 - why is my cursor not turning into a
113:20 - pointer
113:22 - yes
113:23 - good job
113:26 - we need to import it import
113:29 - punk list dot css
113:31 - okay now i hover over and look at that
113:34 - it turns into a mouse clicky pointer
113:37 - thing
113:38 - beautiful so our styling style file is
113:41 - connected now let's do display flex and
113:43 - let's see if it works
113:45 - oh
113:46 - it didn't work oh it worked
113:49 - whoa guys isn't that nice
113:51 - isn't that pretty freaking sick looks
113:54 - super cool right i know what you're
113:56 - gonna say it's looking a little goofy
113:58 - right now with it's with it going over
114:00 - like that
114:01 - but it looks pretty good
114:03 - other than that
114:05 - um
114:06 - quick question
114:08 - whenever you see things that are
114:10 - overflowing like this and bleeding out
114:12 - of the page bleeding out of the page and
114:15 - overflowing
114:17 - what's the pattern you're thinking about
114:19 - what's the pattern you're thinking about
114:23 - overflowing
114:25 - out of the page
114:28 - yes
114:29 - good job good job
114:33 - okay so we're gonna make overflow scroll
114:37 - up scroll
114:40 - so this is going to make it so like we
114:41 - can actually scroll through it all right
114:44 - so you could do overflow like sometimes
114:46 - overflow hidden can work in this case
114:48 - overflow scroll is gonna work okay
114:50 - because you just put in a scroll box now
114:53 - the whole screen doesn't scroll along
114:55 - with it does that make sense
114:56 - okay cool
114:58 - um
114:59 - let's make it so the scroll bar does not
115:02 - show up so let's see if we can do that
115:06 - let's go web
115:07 - kit scroll bar
115:10 - and we'll go display
115:12 - none
115:15 - nope that bar still is showing up it
115:17 - just gets and got even a little bit
115:19 - uglier interesting
115:20 - we'll see if we can do something about
115:22 - that
115:23 - oh wait why are there so many of those

119:55 - of the styling and and try to explain as
119:57 - i go along

120:05 - this whole thing right here
120:08 - yeah you got this whole thing right
120:10 - there
120:11 - and then inside of it you got the main
120:13 - content
120:14 - okay so this is going to be the content
120:16 - that's inside of it
120:18 - then you have the punk highlight

120:35 - punk highlight we also will have punk
120:37 - highlight
120:38 - we'll also have the punk
120:40 - container
120:41 - it's going to contain it all
120:44 - okay we're going to have the very
120:45 - specific selected punk
120:49 - because there's tons of information
120:50 - about this punk right so this punk
120:52 - container can can be like a big one
120:55 - because it needs to contain
120:57 - the name

121:00 - the address who the owner is a bunch of
121:02 - stuff like that
121:04 - right
121:05 - and then
121:07 - on the right hand side we'll have a
121:09 - couple of other things right like for
121:11 - example we got
121:13 - we got all of this stuff right here
121:16 - at the owner link to instagram twitter
121:20 - more
121:21 - so there's a bunch of stuff going on in
121:23 - here okay i'll try to go through it but
121:25 - we'll go through this a little bit
121:26 - faster
121:29 - all right so class name for the whole
121:31 - thing is gonna be main
121:34 - all right inside of here we're going to
121:35 - have a class name this is going to
121:37 - contain the main content that's kind of
121:39 - what we want
121:42 - okay
121:42 - in here we'll have a class name of
121:46 - punk highlight
121:49 - and then in here we're gonna have class
121:52 - name
121:53 - of punk container
121:55 - okay
121:56 - inside of punk container we'll have an
121:58 - image
122:00 - okay this image will be the active punk
122:04 - that is selected
122:06 - original url
122:11 - okay
122:14 - like this
122:15 - okay
122:16 - activepunk and then we will also put a
122:20 - class name here because we want to style
122:22 - this later and we'll call this
122:24 - selected punk
122:28 - okay cool
122:29 - so so far
122:31 - so good
122:32 - okay
122:36 - yep we got our punk container right here
122:40 - all right
122:47 - right outside of this we're gonna have
122:48 - our punk uh details all right so
122:55 - so right outside of our entire punk
122:57 - highlight
122:58 - we're going to have punk detail so we're
123:00 - going to go like this
123:02 - and we're going to say class name and
123:03 - we're going to go punk details
123:07 - okay
123:07 - and we'll do some in-line styling here
123:10 - as well just so you guys can see how to
123:12 - do it
123:13 - but we're gonna just give it a color
123:15 - text color of white
123:18 - okay inside of the punk details
123:21 - we want to have a class name we're gonna
123:23 - call it title this is gonna be
123:26 - essentially that big huge
123:29 - you know bold right in your face name
123:34 - oh wow

123:45 - nice thank you so much for the 10
123:47 - donation and it seems like
123:49 - this person just graduated from our

123:53 - amazing happy super happy to hear that
123:58 - okay cool
124:00 - class name
124:01 - title right and then inside of here
124:04 - we're going to put our active punk
124:06 - active punk's
124:08 - name okay
124:11 - okay we're gonna put a span tag next to
124:14 - this
124:15 - and we'll give it item number
124:22 - okay and you know while we're doing this
124:26 - let's make it so we can also kind of see
124:27 - what we're doing so it's not just
124:29 - completely like all blind so i'll just
124:31 - go main
124:34 - all right and uh let's import it as well
124:36 - so i'll remove the n and import
124:40 - okay let's uh let's go let's go
124:45 - here and refresh
124:53 - yep let's go back to main
124:57 - so instead of active punk we'll just
124:58 - kind of hard code these names for now so
125:01 - i'll just say bandana
125:03 - bandana
125:05 - punk
125:07 - all right i will grab this guy here as
125:09 - well
125:10 - and uh for this image url
125:14 - we'll just um
125:16 - do our own image right this one right
125:18 - here we'll put it as a string
125:24 - amazing there we go
125:25 - okay
125:27 - so now
125:28 - this main is at least starting to show
125:30 - up right you guys can see the main
125:33 - um it's huge
125:35 - right but it's it's there so let's work
125:38 - on it visually so we can see what we're
125:40 - doing as we go
125:44 - cool so punk details
125:47 - we got the title
125:50 - yeah
125:53 - and then class name item number we're
125:55 - gonna put that little uh dot thing again
126:01 - okay and uh i'll just put a token id so
126:04 - i'll just say three here
126:06 - okay all of this stuff we're going to be
126:08 - changing with dynamic data afterwards
126:10 - okay
126:12 - outside of here
126:15 - let's go ahead and do div
126:17 - class name
126:19 - owner details
126:20 - and guys we're almost coming to an end
126:23 - okay but the last functionality that you
126:25 - want to stick around for this is the
126:26 - honestly the most important one is when
126:28 - you click and
126:30 - you know when you select this that one
126:33 - shows up so that one we're almost
126:35 - getting there okay we're almost there
126:40 - owner details
126:46 - item number yes that's absolutely right
126:49 - so underneath item number we're gonna
126:51 - have owner
126:54 - and inside of our
126:56 - owner we're gonna have
126:59 - owner image container
127:01 - because now we need to start putting
127:03 - owner information
127:04 - and we're gonna have an image for our
127:06 - owner
127:08 - okay and for now we're just gonna put
127:12 - this same image
127:14 - okay just for now
127:17 - owner image container
127:20 - and then outside of this
127:30 - so this is our owner image container
127:35 - yep outside of this we want to put owner
127:37 - details some other owner details so
127:39 - let's go here and we'll go class name
127:43 - owner details
127:47 - okay inside of here
127:49 - i want to go
127:50 - owner name and handle
127:53 - so just to kind of visually show you
127:55 - what we're working on right now is
127:58 - you know owner name and handle and
128:00 - that's where that will go
128:02 - uh owner image will go right there
128:06 - yeah and then we need to put some other
128:08 - details like the owner's wallet address
128:11 - and then we're gonna put these
128:13 - okay and then we're we're done with the
128:15 - all the owner stuff
128:17 - but it's all gonna be under this owner
128:19 - div
128:20 - okay
128:23 - owner name and handle so inside of owner
128:25 - name and handle we're gonna have a div
128:27 - right here
128:29 - and uh this is gonna be the owner
128:31 - address so we'll just put this address
128:34 - right here
128:42 - okay
128:43 - right underneath this will go div
128:47 - and this will have the class name of
128:50 - owner
128:52 - handle
128:53 - i will do at clever programmer
129:01 - okay
129:04 - yeah so this is showing the owner's
129:06 - stuff
129:07 - and all that stuff is starting to show
129:09 - up except you guys know why it's not
129:11 - showing up like we can't read it easily
129:14 - right can you guess why this is
129:16 - happening
129:22 - yep
129:24 - exactly font color so we're going to
129:26 - handle that font color as well once we
129:28 - get to the styling part okay and then we
129:30 - just have one last part that's left and
129:34 - then we're just gonna do that part and
129:36 - um
129:37 - it's a bunch of some of it this code is
129:39 - kind of repeating so i'll do this a
129:41 - little bit faster
129:44 - so right underneath the owner handle
129:47 - right it's just some repeating code
129:49 - right here all right so we got
129:52 - um
129:53 - instagram logo twitter logo and then a
129:56 - more icon right so there's just these
129:58 - three repeating and we just pop that in
130:01 - right there now i got this error
130:03 - instagram logo twitter logo and more
130:05 - icon is not defined
130:06 - but that's just because we need to
130:08 - import these images
130:11 - so we're just going to go ahead and do
130:13 - that now
130:14 - okay
130:16 - these images we have access to from our
130:19 - assets
130:21 - okay
130:22 - our assets folder has access to all of
130:24 - these images owner images right here
130:28 - and we're just pulling them out and
130:29 - we're just popping them in right there
130:34 - okay so now boom
130:36 - right this is showing up
130:38 - great
130:40 - now what we need to do is uh we just
130:43 - need to style all this so when i'm
130:45 - thinking styling for main component what
130:48 - am i going to be doing guys what's the
130:49 - pattern here that you're seeing i need
130:51 - to style so what's my next step without
130:54 - even thinking you should be able to get
130:55 - to this
130:59 - yes absolute somebody said flex no you
131:02 - need to create a file so we're going to
131:04 - create a file it's going to be called
131:06 - main.css okay good job so now in
131:08 - main.css we're going to do a bunch of
131:10 - styling so i'm going to grab main and
131:12 - i'll say max height
131:14 - set it to 50
131:16 - uh vh okay so let's refresh
131:19 - cool
131:20 - okay so we we just kind of made sure
131:22 - that the height is uh there's a certain
131:24 - max of the height it doesn't go
131:26 - more or less than that okay but now
131:29 - it's not showing up so what do we need
131:32 - to do okay i just added some styling but
131:34 - it didn't do anything
131:36 - whenever that happens what do i need to
131:38 - do
131:39 - good job isaac good job
131:42 - lucero good job aaron good job everybody
131:45 - refresh that's another one good job but
131:47 - in this case walter good job this is
131:49 - going to be import so we're going to
131:50 - import
131:53 - main.css
131:54 - okay
131:55 - so there you go
131:58 - right there's something happening even
132:00 - though it's not looking right yet but
132:02 - there's something happening so that's a
132:04 - good sign
132:05 - now we're going to go main content we're
132:07 - going to go display
132:09 - flex
132:11 - go padding
132:12 - bottom
132:15 - 20 pixels on this we'll go border bottom
132:19 - one pixel solid and make it white
132:22 - like this
132:24 - okay
132:25 - so
132:27 - um
132:29 - now we have this
132:31 - these some of these huge images
132:33 - right but it's they're showing up at the
132:36 - very least and their styling that we're
132:38 - doing is actually doing what it needs to
132:40 - do
132:41 - let's go punk highlight
132:43 - and we're going to make the flex on this
132:45 - thing 0.25
132:48 - i'm going to make sure it's display flex
132:51 - and we'll center align everything and we
132:54 - will
132:55 - also
132:57 - horizontally align everything okay let's
133:00 - refresh
133:01 - cool
133:02 - so now things are starting to get a
133:03 - little bit more contained they're still
133:05 - weird but they're starting to get a
133:07 - little bit more contained
133:08 - okay now let's
133:10 - go to the punk container
133:13 - and put a border radius on it of 20
133:16 - pixels
133:18 - we'll do overflow
133:21 - hidden
133:23 - okay
133:24 - so the screen like right now the screen
133:26 - still kind of goes to the side so we'll
133:28 - try to control this too in a second
133:33 - let's enable display flex on this
133:36 - okay and then we'll give a margin right
133:38 - of 20 pixels
133:41 - okay
133:43 - all right um we will need to style
133:45 - selected punk as well soon enough but
133:48 - that's after we add in our
133:51 - punk functionality
133:53 - punk details
133:55 - display flex
133:59 - okay
134:07 - okay
134:10 - all right
134:13 - we'll go flex direction on this thing
134:15 - and i'll go column
134:18 - all right we'll justify content we'll go
134:20 - space between on this
134:23 - and flex will go 0.75
134:26 - okay
134:30 - all right
134:31 - um
134:32 - let's just double check
134:33 - what is happening and why is this is uh
134:37 - this is looking
134:39 - like this for too long i'll try killing
134:40 - this and yarn starting it again
134:45 - david can you double check this and see
134:48 - um
134:49 - there's something going on with this
134:53 - okay let's just go back here i just want
134:55 - to make sure everything is looking good
134:57 - structurally okay
135:01 - you can have one div off and the whole
135:03 - thing will be thrown off like crazy
135:13 - closing here
135:15 - that closes that closes this closes okay
135:18 - so that's good
135:20 - corner details looks good
135:26 - okay we have the main
135:28 - main contains everything
135:41 - yeah
135:43 - it's uh getting a little bit wild
135:50 - are you in here
135:54 - david
135:56 - oh
135:57 - okay i was just checking if you if
135:59 - you're in here or not
136:01 - um i don't see your cursor anywhere
136:05 - i actually click this following ah okay
136:08 - i can see you now
136:10 - cool
136:12 - okay so while we figure out the styling
136:15 - uh let's go here
136:19 - i'll try to simplify it in a second if
136:21 - we don't fix this bug but i'm just going
136:24 - to check the structure and see if it's
136:25 - sound
136:27 - okay that looks good
136:29 - we have the image
136:30 - that's fine
136:35 - yep
136:36 - yeah that looks good
136:39 - we have the punk details
136:53 - yeah
136:55 - punk owner
136:58 - huh that all looks good
137:02 - it all looks good
137:14 - hmm
137:38 - okay so something magically
137:42 - worked okay so let's see what are the
137:45 - things that actually made that happen
137:49 - because it is kind of all over the place
137:53 - uh david is it a selected punk one that
137:55 - i didn't add oh yeah i didn't add that
137:58 - one yeah you have the class name
137:59 - selected punk
138:02 - yeah
138:03 - that's the one i think we needed to add
138:05 - okay
138:07 - uh you can talk to right david or you're
138:09 - on mute
138:21 - hello nice okay okay
138:24 - um i'm hearing feedback
138:28 - oh no
138:28 - now it's good now it's good
138:30 - okay awesome
138:32 - so uh
138:33 - is it the selected punk one because uh
138:36 - that should be good i just i dropped
138:38 - that in and
138:40 - after that you said oh it's good
138:42 - okay um i'll try to okay so
138:45 - let's
138:46 - i'm gonna kind of get past this guys a
138:48 - little bit so i am cheating here
138:51 - because i just want to make sure that
138:53 - this gets done and then we have the
138:54 - select uh functionality working so even
138:57 - if we have some bugs left we'll try to
138:59 - finish them out before this thing ends
139:02 - but i want to kind of move on because i
139:04 - think styling is an important part but
139:06 - it's not the most important part of the
139:08 - app
139:09 - um we'll get more to the styling let's
139:12 - work on the functionality let's get the
139:13 - selected punk uh working
139:16 - and then we'll fix the styling so maybe
139:18 - david if you want to like uh see if you
139:20 - can fix these here right like
139:23 - the styling move it down and i can
139:25 - explain it at the end do you want to
139:26 - work on that for a little bit
139:28 - okay so you try to kind of work on that
139:30 - and um
139:32 - i'll i'll i'll get the select
139:34 - functionality working
139:36 - okay so what you guys missed here is i
139:39 - you and you guys can screenshot this or
139:41 - go through the video but i just kind of
139:43 - put the finished version of the styling
139:46 - okay so there's a bunch of things here
139:48 - that i added like for example title
139:51 - to give it a title size
139:53 - okay and
139:54 - item number
139:56 - styling for the owner the styling for
139:58 - each div the owner image container
140:01 - because like all of these we're just
140:02 - going to take a ton of time
140:04 - and
140:05 - all of these styling i'm going to make
140:06 - it available for you guys so you guys
140:08 - can kind of go through it at your own
140:09 - pace and you should be fine
140:12 - okay
140:14 - the only one that's bugging me is like
140:16 - the size of this bandana punk like that
140:19 - that should be easy to make it huge so
140:23 - because we have title
140:25 - class name title
140:30 - and then we have title right here and we
140:32 - are clearly giving it this huge size
140:39 - oh
140:40 - class name with the capital n is that
140:42 - what it is
140:44 - yes
140:46 - nailed it
140:48 - okay there's probably some other like
140:51 - typo that i've made
140:53 - it's causing it to
140:55 - do some funny things but um
140:58 - ah there we go so a lot of it is pretty
141:01 - much good to go there's just probably a
141:02 - couple of other things left but
141:04 - this looks good enough for now and now i
141:06 - want to move on to the functionality of
141:07 - when you select it actually puts that
141:10 - one right there okay
141:13 - cool so let's get to it
141:17 - yeah nice we're coming close to the end
141:20 - guys so this is gonna be the finale okay
141:24 - all right so let's work on the selected
141:26 - functionality so here's what we need to
141:28 - do when somebody clicks this i need to
141:32 - recognize that that's been clicked okay
141:34 - so let's go into
141:36 - punk list
141:37 - and in punk list what i'm going to do is
141:40 - i want to add an on click
141:42 - on the on the card
141:44 - all right so let's go here and let's go
141:46 - on click
141:47 - and i want you to do the following
141:49 - for now just console log punk.token id
141:54 - all right so when i click this
141:56 - show me the id of this and so it should
141:58 - show me zero for bandana punk one for
142:01 - cyberpunk two for cigar hat punk
142:04 - let's hit inspect
142:06 - it's at console
142:09 - class name did you mean class name
142:12 - um
142:14 - okay
142:18 - david is there another place we have
142:20 - class name lowercase somewhere
142:24 - because i think that's kind of what it's
142:25 - telling me
142:27 - okay let's look it up
142:30 - all right so i'm gonna click one of
142:32 - these guys click
142:34 - so it says one right when i click this
142:36 - one you guys see how it says two at the
142:38 - bottom right there
142:39 - click another one
142:40 - okay i'll see if i can zoom in on this
142:42 - so you guys can see it better boom click
142:45 - this one three click this one four
142:47 - click this one five click this one so
142:49 - i'm able to actually get the id
142:52 - on click and on my clicks were being
142:54 - detected
142:56 - here's what i'm gonna do now
142:58 - now we're gonna get it make it a little
142:59 - bit fancier so i'm gonna go to my app
143:02 - and i'll create
143:05 - a state variable for which is the
143:07 - selected punk
143:10 - okay
143:11 - so we're gonna do uh selected punk and
143:13 - we're gonna do set selected punk
143:15 - and uh and by default i'm just gonna
143:17 - have it be zero
143:19 - okay
143:20 - this selected punk hook i'm actually
143:23 - gonna pass it
143:28 - i think i should be able to pass it like
143:30 - this too right does that work
143:34 - maybe not
143:36 - yeah or maybe that works set selected
143:38 - punk
143:39 - okay we'll give it a try if it doesn't
143:41 - work then then we'll fix it
143:43 - let's go to punk list and i'm going to
143:45 - pass set selected
143:47 - punk
143:48 - like this
143:49 - and then i'm going to change the
143:51 - selected punk through this i'm going to
143:53 - say set selected punk like that
143:55 - okay
143:58 - and
143:59 - i believe this should okay just to be
144:01 - safe i'll leave this here like this i
144:03 - can always check my theory later
144:06 - i think that should work but yeah let's
144:07 - just leave this like this uh oh wait
144:10 - sorry set selected punk
144:12 - like that all right
144:15 - so now what should happen is when i
144:17 - click
144:19 - uh this variable selected punk
144:21 - should get updated with which is the
144:23 - which
144:24 - with whichever is the currently active
144:27 - selected punk or like the most recent
144:29 - one that i just clicked
144:33 - um how do i switch between files so fast
144:36 - i have a shortcut so for you guys it
144:38 - should be like command
144:41 - p or something i think
144:42 - yep command p yeah command p and if you
144:45 - do command pp it'll switch to the most
144:48 - recent file if you do command p and then
144:50 - like type in so for example
144:53 - you know if you type in the name of the
144:54 - file like it'll take you there
144:57 - right so i'll just do i change that to
144:59 - command d because i think command d is a
145:01 - much better shortcut way better than
145:03 - command p but just just do command p
145:06 - and then if you do command pp it'll take
145:08 - you the most recent file
145:10 - and if you do command p
145:12 - and then just type start type like don't
145:14 - even look and think about it just like
145:16 - whatever file you want to go to may not
145:18 - just type it in hit enter and
145:20 - boom it'll take you there so really fast
145:22 - way to navigate around
145:25 - command pp yeah go to the bathroom
145:27 - that's funny
145:28 - [Music]
145:30 - okay cool so i got this
145:33 - so far so that's good so selected punk
145:35 - that's
145:36 - awesome now what we need to do
145:39 - is when i do select the punk i need this
145:43 - image
145:44 - and this whole thing to update
145:48 - yeah
145:49 - so let's go ahead and work on that okay
145:53 - so punk list
145:56 - pass it
146:04 - all right so in maine what i want to do
146:06 - is let's go to main
146:08 - and in maine i want to do the following
146:11 - i want to basically say
146:13 - const active
146:16 - punk
146:17 - set active
146:19 - punk
146:20 - and we'll just say use state
146:24 - and the from punk list data
146:26 - grab the first um
146:29 - punk okay
146:30 - and uh we'll also pass some props so
146:33 - we'll pass it selected punk and we'll
146:35 - pass it punk list
146:37 - data
146:39 - so this will be all of the punks this is
146:41 - the currently selected punk that will
146:43 - pass it
146:46 - all right now it doesn't know use state
146:48 - so we're going to import you state like
146:49 - david is helping us super nicely thank
146:52 - you
146:52 - all right so we're going to
146:54 - import your state
146:56 - and then we'll also need use effect so
146:58 - david if you could also import use
147:00 - effect that'll be really nice and we'll
147:03 - go and we'll do this
147:07 - set activepunk to
147:11 - punk list
147:12 - data
147:14 - and then in here i'm going to say
147:15 - selected punk just like this
147:18 - and for the dependency array here all i
147:21 - need is punk list data
147:24 - and then selected punk
147:26 - okay
147:27 - this means that the page will update if
147:30 - the punk list changes or the selected
147:32 - punch changes because that's what you
147:33 - want right you don't want to hit refresh
147:35 - every single time to see the change you
147:37 - want to see it in real time
147:40 - okay
147:42 - um punk list data
147:45 - [Music]
147:47 - yep so it's getting an error on this
147:50 - line
147:51 - it's having problems reading this okay
147:53 - because we're not passing it to main so
147:55 - i'm going to go right here
147:56 - and i need to pass punk list data to
147:59 - main so we'll say punk list data
148:01 - is equal to
148:05 - punk list
148:07 - data just like that
148:11 - oh nice look at that
148:13 - did that work actually
148:16 - oh yes it did work but it's not active
148:18 - yet like it's not um
148:20 - this is not dynamic yet because it's
148:22 - just like pulling dummy data so now we
148:25 - need to actually give it
148:27 - actual data
148:28 - right so what i need to do here
148:32 - is this source here now
148:35 - what we're going to do is we're going to
148:36 - change it and this just turns into
148:37 - activepunk.image.url
148:41 - okay
148:42 - cannot read properties of undefined
148:46 - okay
148:47 - punk list data we're passing it in
148:50 - we're grabbing the xeros guy
148:54 - that's what the active punk then becomes
148:58 - should be good
149:02 - okay
149:04 - main
149:07 - punchless data
149:12 - pass it
149:14 - punchless data
149:20 - mm-hmm
149:22 - receive punchless data grab the zeroth
149:25 - element inside of it
149:36 - hmm
149:49 - cannot read properties of undefined
149:57 - well it should be defined okay so let's
150:00 - just um
150:01 - let's comment this out for a second
150:07 - what the heck
150:09 - where'd everything go
150:11 - uh this is when
150:13 - wait you're doing the api call already
150:15 - right yeah so this is when you want to
150:18 - check for if
150:20 - if the api call has gone through already
150:24 - you know the puncture is data length
150:25 - more than zero oh okay okay yeah that's
150:28 - the js okay cool so in here uh that's
150:31 - actually a good catch so what we want to
150:33 - do is we don't even want to call these
150:35 - unless the api call has gone through so
150:38 - the little hack that we can actually do
150:40 - for this is we can actually go punk
150:41 - listdata.length
150:44 - and if that's greater than zero then and
150:47 - only then pass this because yeah right
150:49 - now it's being called without the api
150:52 - call even happening
150:54 - so we're gonna pop that in here close
150:56 - off with parentheses
150:58 - and uh
151:00 - yeah okay
151:07 - and this is going to be in a gss
151:09 - fragment
151:22 - wait what are you doing david doing
151:23 - something
151:28 - yeah perfect thank you
151:31 - so all we did here guys is
151:34 - can this come up online because i'll
151:36 - look much better
151:39 - okay that's
151:41 - um so yeah basically all we're doing
151:43 - here is we're saying hey are there like
151:46 - punks yes
151:48 - do all of this otherwise don't do it
151:51 - so now we're not gonna get that weird
151:53 - error okay this is all it's doing
151:55 - otherwise it just won't show anything if
151:57 - there's no punks it just won't show any
151:58 - of this
152:00 - any of this being main and punk list
152:04 - okay cool so let's go back to main
152:07 - now we are getting the punk let's
152:10 - uncomment this out
152:13 - and uncomment this out
152:17 - okay
152:21 - okay
152:23 - so we're still getting that error punk
152:25 - list data
152:27 - uh-huh
152:41 - okay so let's just read it out let's
152:44 - just like console log it and see what
152:46 - the error is uh
152:48 - what the error is i'll console log
152:51 - here
152:52 - punk list data so we can see what's what
152:55 - the heck is going on i'll just cut this
152:57 - image out for now
153:00 - and let's see if we're getting
153:05 - and we're getting what we're looking for
153:09 - console
153:16 - all right
153:18 - so save
153:20 - refresh
153:25 - all right so i'm going to put a little
153:27 - emoji here so we can actually see where
153:29 - this is coming from
153:33 - also i think it's you know i know it's
153:36 - not as smooth but i think it's also good
153:38 - for you guys to see some live debugging
153:41 - because it is helpful because a lot of
153:43 - the times in reality you're always going
153:44 - to be running into problems it's not
153:46 - going to go as smooth
153:49 - so i am getting the freaking
153:52 - um
153:52 - [Music]
153:55 - i'm getting what i'm looking for
154:02 - image
154:03 - underscore original underscore url
154:07 - yeah image underscore original
154:08 - underscore url i have that right there
154:12 - do we not wait do we not get the
154:15 - selected punk because it seems like
154:18 - that's where the problem is
154:21 - because i just added that and started
154:22 - bugging out again
154:24 - even if you put that it should be fine
154:28 - oops
154:35 - absolutely are you passing both the
154:37 - props and ben carter asks i believe
154:42 - so it should already have a
154:46 - value
154:49 - yeah we're getting uh image original url
154:52 - image original url
154:55 - we're now passing in selected point in
154:56 - domain
155:00 - now we do oh
155:04 - good call
155:05 - these little things
155:07 - okay okay okay okay yes yes good call so
155:09 - in maine what david just said is we were
155:12 - not passing or selected punk
155:14 - now we are
155:16 - okay there we go
155:18 - that's why i was getting like undefined
155:19 - and stuff like that
155:21 - so
155:22 - now that we're passing in our selected
155:24 - punk it should actually
155:28 - what the heck is happening
155:34 - okay there we go
155:36 - now it's like showing up perfect perfect
155:38 - perfect perfect and if i chose like one
155:41 - will it do something cool
155:46 - okay yeah so we're passing our selected
155:48 - punk if i chose like one or something
155:50 - you'll yeah it'll choose this one
155:52 - if i chose two it'll choose the next one
155:55 - okay perfect so
155:57 - selected punk is now being passed
156:01 - and it's doing it
156:02 - okay let's make the rest of this dynamic
156:04 - beautiful starting to make progress
156:06 - again let's make the whole thing dynamic
156:09 - okay so for example where the title is
156:12 - now this needs to be activepunk
156:15 - dot name
156:18 - okay
156:19 - so if i give it uh one you'll see not
156:22 - only did it change the photo but it
156:24 - actually changed the title but we need
156:26 - to make sure that this is dynamic as
156:28 - well
156:29 - that id right there so let's go ahead
156:32 - and uh fix that so we're gonna go here
156:35 - and we're going to say
156:36 - we're going to leave some of that there
156:38 - and we're going to say
156:39 - punk dot token id
156:43 - and we're going to say active punk
156:47 - okay let's go boom
156:49 - this is the right id now
156:51 - perfect
156:55 - okay
156:56 - the owner image container you can
156:59 - actually grab the real owner image
157:02 - as well so what we can do is we could
157:04 - say
157:07 - activepunk.owner.profile underscore
157:09 - image
157:10 - underscore url
157:15 - oh we don't need these squigglies here
157:18 - perfect
157:20 - so now it's pulling my actual um
157:23 - image from right there on openc
157:26 - so this is
157:28 - this image is actually accurate
157:32 - yes
157:33 - it's amazing now the next thing is it
157:35 - needs to pull this address dynamically
157:37 - as well because i've hard coded it
157:40 - so we're going to make it active
157:42 - punk dot owner
157:44 - dot address
157:47 - okay
157:49 - and uh
157:50 - yeah this is this is pretty much it for
157:52 - right now just leave the rest as is
157:55 - and uh
157:57 - boom there you guys go look at that
157:59 - right so now when i freaking select this
158:03 - you can see
158:04 - that all of those are being selected
158:07 - isn't that freaking cool guys
158:11 - right and if you guys want to break down
158:15 - kind of how this is working
158:17 - well a lot of the magic is happening
158:20 - here so when we get that active punk
158:24 - we make that our main punk right we make
158:27 - that our active punk whatever we click
158:29 - on whatever is our selected punk we make
158:32 - that our active punk and once that's our
158:34 - active punk
158:35 - we go ahead and do
158:37 - the rest it just shows that right here
158:44 - and the last thing i think
158:46 - yeah the fire emojis are coming in nice
158:49 - is you know we kind of uh flew past the
158:52 - css portion
158:54 - and
158:55 - you know there there's a bunch of it
158:57 - that we didn't cover it there but i
158:58 - think the main thing that main things i
159:00 - just kind of want to show you guys is
159:02 - selected punk right if i take away its
159:04 - styling here you can see how it looks
159:07 - all kinds of crazy this was the one that
159:09 - was messing everything up so as soon as
159:11 - we added that
159:13 - right we gave it a max width and a max
159:15 - height
159:17 - it makes sure and
159:19 - this is super mobile responsive right so
159:22 - if i make it smaller it becomes smaller
159:24 - if i make it bigger
159:26 - like it is
159:27 - beautiful
159:29 - right so that's
159:30 - that magic is happening from here the
159:32 - selected punk
159:34 - okay
159:35 - then
159:35 - punk details
159:38 - all right if i go here
159:39 - the punk details take care of what's
159:41 - happening here
159:44 - okay so if i add that back in punk
159:46 - details you can see the space between is
159:49 - adding the spaces between this and this
159:53 - right
159:54 - flex direction on it is column

163:56 - stay up and push pull through because
163:58 - like that's what a lot of the coding
164:00 - requires guys like if you're wondering
164:02 - why everybody isn't making six figures
164:04 - and why that's not happening and why
164:06 - people are not getting these jobs
164:07 - because because of this the actual
164:08 - coding part this already gets hard right
164:10 - most people want to bounce
164:13 - so
164:14 - you know i hope that
164:16 - you know even though it was like maybe
164:17 - hard or complicated i at least hope
164:20 - was it something that you guys at least
164:22 - understood somewhat of as we went
164:24 - through it did it at least make sense as

164:27 - my main goal
164:30 - okay amazing
164:33 - amazing
164:36 - wow
164:37 - yeah
164:38 - that's that's honestly the main thing
164:40 - right that i want to get to that you
164:41 - guys are enjoying this making progress
164:44 - and that you guys kind of understand
164:46 - this and yes it was so fast right like
164:48 - think about this we did
164:51 - man this this project should take up
164:52 - normal person like a month to do like if
164:55 - a developer got at a if a developer was
164:57 - hired it would take like
164:59 - weeks or like a month to build this
165:02 - or longer
165:03 - right you you got it you watched this
165:07 - project
165:08 - get built
165:10 - in what
165:11 - um

172:10 - i was like
172:11 - that's embarrassing no no it's all good
172:14 - not embarrassing it's all good
172:16 - thank you you got it yeah
172:19 - okay
172:22 - hey
172:23 - this is monika monica hi monica
172:26 - hi
172:27 - great session thank you so much you're
172:29 - welcome thank you
172:31 - i have some questions about the third i
172:33 - mean 3.0 third web and
172:36 - opens the part i don't understand how
172:38 - they are connected and how is
172:40 - decentralization working there
172:43 - um
172:43 - how was what connected
172:46 - like uh we are using openc
172:48 - third web uh so you are taking
172:51 - those networks and the apis right so
172:53 - what is the other connection between
172:55 - them
172:56 - so in this case right we were using um
173:00 - there's a bunch of web 3.0 stuff we were
173:02 - using right for example we were using
173:03 - meta mask we're using third web we were
173:06 - using open c
173:08 - and without them we would not be able to
173:10 - do this project that's how we actually
173:12 - got our nfts to show up because our nfts
173:15 - these ones here
173:17 - would not show up otherwise because we
173:20 - we built our own nfts
173:22 - within third web okay
173:25 - these nfts also got published on openc
173:28 - we use the openc api
173:31 - to pull all of this data
173:33 - so that's how all of these are connected
173:34 - right we use react.js to build the front
173:36 - end so
173:39 - you know we connected react
173:41 - with
173:42 - third web nfts and then open c to pull
173:45 - the data and get access from api and
173:47 - then we use things like metamask
173:50 - to have our wallets so we could actually
173:52 - mint all this and and pull it if that
173:54 - makes sense
173:58 - so is there like any other websites like
174:00 - opencv where we can take the source
174:03 - um
174:04 - there are but openc's the most popular
174:06 - one
174:08 - the the the thing that a lot that helped
174:10 - us out a lot with this project was third
174:12 - web because that's how we were able to
174:14 - like
174:15 - get the nfts minted and and and publish
174:17 - to open c and then be able to pull it
174:19 - from there but yeah i would say like if
174:20 - you wanted to do something with
174:22 - uh in terms of a marketplace open c is
174:24 - going to be your best choice because the
174:25 - most popular one
174:27 - okay
174:28 - thank you
174:29 - you got it monica thank you for your
174:30 - question
174:32 - um
174:34 - yeah so yeah somebody asked will the
174:36 - boot camp take a noob to six figures it
174:39 - it depends on how hard you work like we
174:42 - just had a thomas who
174:44 - uh went to our boot camp and he just got
174:47 - a six-figure job offer
174:49 - like
174:50 - uh three four days ago at reason one inc
174:53 - and he crushed it but not everybody's
174:55 - gonna get that just because
174:57 - like he was one of the hardest working
174:59 - people and his skill level just
175:00 - skyrocketed so he was like really highly
175:03 - skilled and the people just got so
175:05 - excited that interviewed him he thought
175:07 - he was going to get a junior developer
175:08 - job so he literally thought he was going
175:10 - to get like a
175:11 - 60k offer you know 70k offer he was
175:13 - happy with that because his last job was
175:15 - making 45
175:16 - and then he got a job offer
175:18 - uh the the inter the people who
175:20 - interviewed him were so excited they're
175:22 - like man your skills are so amazing and
175:24 - your projects look so good
175:26 - that they came back to him and said um
175:28 - you know i don't think we will hire you
175:30 - as a junior developer your your skills
175:32 - are higher than that so we'll bring you
175:34 - on as an intermediate software like full
175:36 - stack developer and they offered him
175:38 - ninety five thousand dollars with a five
175:39 - thousand dollar bonus which essentially
175:41 - is a hundred thousand dollar a year job
175:43 - so that's how that worked out
175:46 - uh but not but it doesn't happen for
175:48 - everybody so i just want to say that for
175:50 - most people on average you should expect
175:52 - like a 60 to 70 000
175:54 - like as your first job
175:57 - you know but i'm just saying average
175:59 - because i just want to have everybody's
176:00 - expectation be just super clear
176:04 - and yeah everybody don't listen to the
176:05 - negative nancy i say thank you yeah
176:07 - there's always people crying and
176:10 - whining about stuff but you know the
176:12 - people who become developers they're
176:13 - just like they have no excuses to just
176:15 - keep going and keep working you know
176:16 - like for example this crew right here
176:18 - 109 of you are still freaking live
176:21 - it's 8 14 p.m on a saturday you know
176:24 - some of you are about to lose your
176:25 - relationships
176:27 - uh over coding
176:30 - but you know that's the choice you made
176:33 - oh man
176:36 - you know
176:37 - 11 14
176:38 - rogers has already lost it just now
176:44 - man my wife pissed off yeah i hear you
176:47 - i haven't had dinner oh man i think i
176:50 - kind of want to have sushi with my
176:51 - girlfriend tonight i think that'll be
176:53 - that'll be nice
176:54 - i think that actually be great i'll get
176:56 - to preserve my relationship as well
177:00 - coding is greater than everything david
177:01 - says
177:03 - [Music]
177:06 - it is a lot of fun i'm not gonna lie
177:08 - okay any other questions or feedback or
177:12 - something like that uh before we bounce

181:25 - yo you should do that you can go get
181:28 - take it to that level if you want you
181:30 - can try to take it to the level that
181:31 - would be really dope
181:33 - gerardo okay cool
181:34 - um you were at a react intensive right
181:37 - i am and i also just graduated from the
181:39 - august cohort boot camp as well oh snap

181:49 - i'm with isaac right now too okay
181:51 - beautiful yo isaac let's go
181:54 - okay awesome yeah i think um
181:58 - yeah if you want to take that to to the
182:00 - next level add the buy now functionality
182:02 - to it too that'd be that'd be a huge
182:05 - uh bonus on that
182:07 - cool
182:08 - devol says what would we need to change
182:12 - with
182:13 - what
182:14 - hold on i'm having trouble reading what
182:16 - would we need to change with this
182:18 - project to be able to sell the nfts on
182:20 - the market
182:23 - you can sell it on the market so okay
182:25 - yeah what would you need to change is
182:26 - you need to take it from the test to a
182:28 - real market so if you do that then you
182:30 - can actually like put in a real
182:32 - marketplace and actually list it for a
182:35 - uh price
182:37 - like i could probably go to third web
182:39 - right now
182:40 - and um list it for a price on a real
182:42 - marketplace so yeah
182:46 - all right any other uh questions
182:49 - or things
182:52 - cody i see you cody you i know you're
182:54 - you just joined the new um
182:57 - cohort
182:58 - we're looking out for you it's going to
183:00 - be awesome uh who was going to go
183:01 - somebody was just about to ask i'm sorry
183:03 - i cut you off yeah i had a quick one
183:04 - quasi oh yeah oh what's up joe go for it
183:07 - so if we
183:10 - foreign when you are in an interview and
183:12 - you want like a project pitch right
183:14 - and i'm demonstrating my project yeah
183:17 - what are the key points i should be
183:18 - hitting when i'm trying to explain these
183:19 - things i
183:21 - just uh bombard the recruiter with you
183:25 - know wow
183:26 - what so with the
183:29 - with thomas right what i knew was he was
183:31 - just like
183:33 - he was so excited about his project and
183:35 - he would just keep talking about his
183:37 - project like he was just genuinely
183:38 - excited about it and i think for the
183:41 - people who were interviewing him that
183:43 - caught
183:44 - uh his their their eye and their
183:46 - attention because he was just like and
183:48 - he built it too and he just loved every
183:50 - part of it he's like let me show you
183:52 - this he's like you know i built this
183:54 - scraper here it has this like advanced
183:56 - feature and he has like this thick
183:57 - accent but but like it's still
184:00 - you know he just would talk about it all
184:02 - the time and talk about all the
184:03 - functionality added and what it could do
184:05 - and so
184:06 - i don't think like you need to have a
184:08 - necessarily like a trick but i think
184:11 - that if you're excited about what you
184:12 - built and you did put in a lot of hard
184:14 - work and if you want to talk about it
184:15 - and talk about all the things that you
184:16 - did i think that goes a long way and i
184:18 - think that passion that excitement like
184:20 - rubs off and and people can ex feel it
184:23 - from you from a distance
184:25 - cool thanks you got it
184:27 - uh david says what's the best way to
184:28 - prepare for the boot camp slash cohort
184:30 - so for example the people that are
184:32 - joining like cody who just joined one of
184:34 - our
184:35 - december cohorts
184:36 - um
184:37 - we have pre-course material for you and
184:39 - you can kind of get started on it and
184:41 - that'll give you a jump start um and get
184:44 - you ready for the boot camp okay but i
184:47 - mean honestly this is even like a great
184:50 - thing to prepare you for the boot camp
184:51 - because the boot camp itself we cover
184:53 - everything from scratch so there's
184:55 - nothing like
184:57 - it's not like you come to the boot camp
184:58 - and there's a bunch of stuff that you
184:59 - didn't cover and you're like oh man it's
185:01 - too advanced like no we'll cover
185:02 - everything but even this stuff will help
185:04 - you a lot and then if you join then the
185:06 - pre-course material will help you a lot
185:10 - um
185:15 - yeah if any of you guys are interested
185:18 - uh dm me right now you know and uh what
185:20 - i can do is i can set up a call with you
185:23 - or my team and we can just learn if this

186:44 - so
186:45 - um ben says ben is interested okay maybe
186:48 - i i just i hope i didn't miss anybody
186:50 - else okay
186:53 - cool
186:55 - yeah so yeah we'll just book a call and
186:57 - then we'll go from there okay brock says
186:59 - i am
187:01 - um
187:02 - chris
187:04 - okay
187:06 - uh oscar says full stack developer yeah
187:09 - it's a mixture of front end developer
187:10 - and full stack developer the reason why
187:12 - we're focusing more on front-end
187:13 - developer is because you can do it in
187:14 - half the time
187:16 - full stack developer take you eight
187:17 - months front end developer will take you
187:18 - three months and then you'll have a job
187:20 - in your fourth or fifth month right
187:22 - that's why we want to focus on that a
187:24 - lot more
187:26 - my god you said my name right thank you
187:28 - you got it
187:29 - jamori is interested jamori
187:37 - okay cool
187:43 - yeah
187:44 - so even with the so yeah so what we
187:45 - noticed is
187:47 - front like getting your first job as a
187:49 - front end developer will take you half
187:51 - the time but you'll make essentially the
187:52 - same amount of money you'll make as a
187:54 - full stack developer so then in my mind
187:56 - why would you spend twice the time to
187:58 - make the same amount of money
188:01 - next if you do really want to get a full
188:03 - stack developer job why don't you get a
188:05 - front-end developer job first and then
188:07 - you can get a promotion as a full-stack
188:08 - developer job is much easier to do
188:11 - with all of that said a lot of our
188:13 - front-end developers are still getting a
188:15 - job as a full-stack developer because we
188:17 - are still teaching them front-end skills
188:20 - and full-stack skills so we're teaching
188:21 - them both actually
188:23 - because you're still dealing with
188:24 - firebase you're still dealing with crud
188:26 - functionality and things like that
188:29 - um
188:31 - kodi cb so cody says cp provides a lot
188:33 - of info that a lot of boot camps do not
188:35 - and i have not even started the boot
188:36 - camp just to pre-work
188:38 - cody thank you for sharing that
188:39 - appreciate it cody is going to be in our
188:40 - december cohort so if you guys join
188:42 - you'll be cody's peers
188:45 - oscar asks is there interview prep and
188:47 - resume yes our coding bootcamps have
188:49 - interview prep and resume and we will
188:51 - work with you until you get a job
188:57 - and if for some reason you don't get a
188:59 - job we give a job money back guarantee
189:02 - because we don't want just another
189:03 - student we want a success story so like
189:05 - if you don't get a job
189:07 - and you show up to the calls you do the
189:09 - work we just give your money back okay
189:11 - so even if you spend six months and you
189:12 - just spent all this time and money and
189:15 - education and whatever and you don't get
189:16 - a job just give your money back
189:18 - like we uh it's not going to make a
189:20 - difference to us to have another student
189:21 - but what's going to make us make a
189:23 - difference is stories like
189:25 - you know um earlier when crystal shared
189:28 - that she just got a job at
189:30 - you know slack or dave lueck just shared
189:32 - he got his six-figure job
189:34 - um
189:35 - that's exciting to us you know that's
189:36 - why we do what we do
189:39 - child says please give me more info on
189:40 - the boot camp ciao if you um yeah so
189:43 - we'll reach out to you as well
189:46 - okay
189:49 - uh def sign me up i'll learn while being
189:51 - paid okay fantastic malcolm
189:54 - uh
189:55 - do you also offer one that teaches web
189:57 - three we're going to start teaching some
189:58 - web three
190:00 - um we might start doing that in our boot
190:02 - camps too as of right now they're just
190:03 - fully focused so here's the intersection
190:06 - we're focused on a lot of our students
190:08 - are getting front-end react js developer
190:10 - jobs but in crypto companies because
190:12 - what we're realizing is a lot of crypto
190:14 - companies need front-end developers and
190:16 - so when we have you learn front end and
190:19 - we have you even build some like crypto
190:21 - related projects which we are going to
190:23 - do in our boot camps moving forward it's
190:25 - gonna like put you in this really solid
190:27 - niche where there's a huge demand and
190:29 - not a lot of supply
190:31 - so like you become a front-end developer
190:33 - which is valuable already but then
190:34 - you'll have like ton of like crypto type
190:36 - of projects so you'll actually be able
190:38 - to land jobs in crypto companies
190:42 - awesome
190:46 - great
190:49 - yeah this is amazing fantastic so yeah
190:53 - get scheduled on a call
190:54 - um every we'll discuss all the details
190:57 - with you there right a lot of it depends
190:59 - on like
191:00 - um
191:01 - everybody's gonna have a different
191:02 - payment plan right it's like depends how
191:04 - you're able to pay
191:06 - um and we just need to discuss things
191:08 - with you like what type of thing works
191:10 - for you are you looking for only the
191:12 - interview prep part are you looking for
191:13 - the whole thing so those are things that
191:16 - we talk about too andre just says
191:17 - schedule let's go front and yeah okay
191:19 - beautiful
191:29 - love crypto calcium
191:31 - voyages says voyages just scheduled the
191:33 - call andre just scheduled the call okay
191:35 - great
191:36 - um any questions um

192:10 - and
192:11 - it's a little complicated because we do

192:15 - try to help the community build uh
192:18 - generational wealth or
192:20 - golf in general to be able to
192:22 - escape the
192:24 - having to work for somebody else and not
192:26 - being able to invest in yourself and
192:28 - yeah literally what you're doing is one
192:30 - of the things that we feel passionate
192:32 - about wow because a lot of people can't
192:34 - escape that struggle um and we want to
192:36 - be there to help
192:37 - um
192:38 - we have a really cool website that i
192:40 - posted in the chat earlier yeah um it's
