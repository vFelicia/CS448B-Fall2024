00:13 - what's up guys this is Kazi from clever
00:17 - programmer comm hopefully this is
00:21 - working we'll find out shortly capture
00:34 - device alright can I fix the screen size
00:44 - okay alright hey guys what's up
00:49 - so hopefully this chat is working I can
00:51 - see the chat I can speak with you guys
00:55 - wow the the caption is working alive I
00:59 - think I just saw that the caption is
01:01 - working live what's up Ali's in what is
01:03 - a polo Yasin what is up mic Matich what
01:07 - is up Richard hello hello everyone this
01:11 - is really great Cinna gaming hub O'Day
01:17 - what's up
01:18 - Fahim err font Thank You gaming hub hi
01:25 - so yeah one of the things that I want to
01:28 - figure out is what type of content do
01:30 - you guys want to see on this channel
01:33 - more of and I just wanted to have like a
01:35 - open-ended discussion because I don't
01:37 - think I've ever really done that before
01:38 - and I also love connecting with
01:41 - everybody from this platform if there is
01:46 - anybody who wants to message me on IG I
01:49 - would love to get on a live video call
01:53 - with you so you guys can like message me
01:56 - directly on my Instagram which is clever
01:58 - cause II and that way I can actually do
02:02 - even a live Q&A so if you have a
02:04 - question for me it's almost like how
02:07 - Gary Vee or somebody would just have a
02:10 - Q&A segment this way I can't actually
02:12 - speak with
02:13 - you directly which would be super super
02:15 - cool because YouTube doesn't allow me to
02:19 - speak directly with you alright
02:22 - Mike says watching from Michigan cool
02:25 - Tanvir we need your life story make
02:29 - videos in selenium automation using
02:31 - Python okay that's great I can do
02:34 - something along those lines because the
02:38 - the problem that's happening is I like I
02:43 - like coding I'm not spending a lot of
02:46 - time coding anymore
02:49 - most of my time is actually spent
02:52 - sharing freelancing knowledge with
02:54 - people software development like that's
02:56 - actually the stuff that I really enjoy
02:58 - doing
02:58 - I still like coding but because I have
03:01 - to run clever programmer make content
03:04 - for you guys work with Aaron and Frankie
03:09 - and Rachel and the whole team in general
03:12 - it makes it really tough for me to find
03:14 - time to code and if I find time to code
03:17 - for myself then it's really hard to then
03:20 - also make content for you guys and what
03:24 - would help you the most because I also
03:26 - think about it like this yes I can make
03:28 - content on technical coding but then I'm
03:31 - also not sure how much that helps you
03:33 - because there's so much technical
03:35 - training out there online like there's
03:38 - you to me there's Udacity there's
03:40 - Pluralsight there's Coursera there's
03:43 - team treehouse it's like millions of
03:45 - resources with technical trainings but I
03:48 - feel like a lot of people are not
03:51 - talking about how freelancing works and
03:53 - how you can actually use Craigslist or
03:56 - how can you use platforms likewise ant
03:59 - or people per hour or code mentor so
04:02 - those are some of the things that I'm
04:04 - thinking about and that's kind of those
04:07 - are the kind of the things I want to
04:09 - have a discussion around
04:11 - give me one second guys Aaron is here
04:26 - from the camera to see if we get any
04:28 - good clips okay easy okay I'm gonna
04:32 - check IG guys I'm gonna check my
04:34 - Instagram my Instagram is clever cause
04:36 - II clever cause II that's my Instagram
04:41 - so if anybody wants a video call with me
04:45 - you can message me there right now and
05:01 - okay yeah because if you message me here
05:06 - then we can actually even get on a call
05:08 - all right let's see what's going on how
05:13 - do you get coaching clients online so
05:15 - that's a really great question just
05:17 - please be a little bit careful that's a
05:19 - really great question there are a lot of
05:22 - online platforms so for example I'll
05:24 - just share my screen with you guys there
05:30 - we go
05:31 - so you could go to platforms like
05:33 - Craigslist okay or you could go to
05:36 - platforms like wise aunt okay this is
05:41 - this is where everybody from India
05:42 - complains that they don't have why is
05:44 - that in their country so just find the
05:47 - equivalent like people per hour as an
05:50 - equivalent or code mentor IO as an
05:52 - equivalent or up work works for you like
05:56 - it works for everyone Fiverr works for
05:58 - everyone
06:01 - Fiverr com okay so before you're from
06:06 - another country and you start
06:07 - complaining which is my least favorite
06:09 - part of any piece of content that I make
06:12 - I always get complaints from Pakistan
06:15 - India Russia that doesn't work in our
06:18 - country yes just Google like its
06:22 - equivalent so whatever is the equivalent
06:25 - networks right so here Fiverr will work
06:28 - for you as well probably Craigslist
06:30 - works for you but if you're in the u.s.
06:32 - you should use something like wisent and
06:35 - you will get so many people from here
06:36 - like if I go to and I type in Python and
06:40 - I click get help you will see people
06:44 - charging seventy five dollars an hour
06:45 - forty dollars an hour Alexander's
06:48 - charging fifty nine Jeff for charging
06:49 - fifty Jeanne Benoit who I have actually
06:54 - worked with he's my facebook friend as
06:56 - well he charges hundred and sixty
06:58 - dollars an hour so really it stretches
07:02 - from 35 260 to beyond and you can be you
07:08 - can have like three to six months of
07:10 - experience and you can jump on this
07:11 - platform and be charging thirty five to
07:13 - fifty an hour you don't need twenty
07:15 - of experience like if I have 20 years of
07:18 - experience I'd be charging two to three
07:19 - hundred dollars an hour and you could
07:21 - charge that there's just some people
07:23 - choose to charge a little bit lower but
07:26 - like you know thirty an hour so wise
07:29 - aunt is a great platform take lessons is
07:33 - another great platform has a pretty good
07:36 - platform to yeah just between wise and
07:41 - and take lessons like I skills my income
07:43 - to like eighty to ninety thousand
07:45 - dollars a year like these two platforms
07:46 - literally these two and then you add in
07:49 - Craigslist into the mix and then you go
07:53 - next level so really like there are a
07:57 - lot of these platforms let's just do the
07:59 - marketing for you for you to teach
08:00 - somebody coding or for you to actually
08:05 - yeah for you to teach somebody coding or
08:08 - you could take it to the next level
08:09 - meaning you can do freelancing here as
08:13 - well let me go back and stop that and
08:17 - jump back on okay let's see what is
08:25 - happening so that hopefully answers your
08:28 - question technical Faraz be motivated
08:32 - says I'm a JavaScript developer should I
08:34 - join this course this course is a lot
08:37 - about freelancing like I know it's
08:38 - called earn 1k wit Python but there's
08:41 - actually there's a little bit of
08:43 - technical training but honestly mostly
08:45 - is how to freelance so that's really the
08:50 - main thing so if you are interested in
08:52 - freelancing then join this course if
08:54 - you're not interested in freelancing
08:55 - then no don't join this course rushing
09:00 - off says do we need prior Python skills
09:02 - foreign one Cawood Python you don't it
09:04 - like helps you build on the whether
09:06 - you're beginner or intermediate or
09:07 - advanced it's just focus on the soft
09:09 - skills for freelancing okay I did yes
09:13 - because then only you can give services
09:15 - to your clients cool easy says yes apart
09:19 - from why is going to take lessons
09:20 - because they're not for foreigners oh
09:22 - yeah he's so sweet there you go there
09:25 - you go
09:25 - cool
09:29 - Aegeus says you're also freelancer or
09:31 - not so yeah I'm a freelance I was a
09:34 - freelancer now am I pretty much run a
09:37 - business but you have to think about
09:39 - what makes a freelancer good it's to be
09:42 - able to get and retain clients so I used
09:45 - to have one client two clients at a time
09:49 - for clients 15 clients now that I'm
09:51 - running an online business I have over
09:53 - 3,600 3,600 clients or 3,600 Plus
09:58 - customers so now I'm able to take that
10:01 - freelancing skill and scale it across
10:04 - and that's what you know I'm doing in my
10:06 - business want a video call with you what
10:13 - to include in bio and on these platforms
10:15 - in bio you can include really it it
10:20 - depends like on to you so for example I
10:23 - have students from clever programmer so
10:28 - I'll just I'll share with you guys some
10:30 - of their profiles
10:41 - okay
11:02 - all right so here we go I will share my
11:06 - screen cool all right so here I have the
11:17 - student Jessie Springer here's her like
11:20 - take lessons profile and again you can
11:22 - have a pretty similar profile depent
11:26 - doesn't really matter that much so you
11:30 - got this profile right here you could
11:35 - take a picture of it or grab the URL
11:37 - whatever and you can look at this
11:39 - profile this profile has been working
11:41 - pretty well for her we have another
11:44 - student if I can find him KC
11:46 - to have his profile I don't have his
11:48 - profile right here okay so that's not a
11:51 - problem but yeah she got her Jessie also
11:55 - got a client from wisent which was
11:58 - pretty cool so this is a testimonial
12:01 - that she ended up getting from it and
12:04 - another one of the students from clever
12:07 - programmer she made this post awhile ago
12:09 - she's like she started tutoring using
12:12 - wise aunt and she ended up landing her
12:14 - first session in 72 hours so it really
12:17 - depends on what skill level you're at
12:19 - like if you are a beginner intermediate
12:23 - advanced that matters because if you
12:26 - have no skills right now then it's
12:29 - really hard for you to teach somebody
12:30 - coding but even if you have three months
12:32 - of experience you have a lot of people
12:33 - that are behind you then you can teach
12:35 - them
12:43 - you
12:50 - you
12:53 - you
13:02 - so let me get out of here let's go back
13:05 - to obs
13:07 - pop this open all right let's I'm gonna
13:10 - go look at your guys this chat now okay
13:16 - data science yeah if you're good in math
13:25 - Python doesn't matter yeah any language
13:28 - is good for you if you're a beginner up
13:32 - work is tougher
13:33 - I would go to wise and take lessons and
13:35 - start from there people per hour or
13:37 - whatever like the alternatives in other
13:39 - countries okay thank you Sina first
13:46 - thing love your videos
14:05 - yeah that could be cool making a project
14:13 - becoming a freelancer mean could take
14:16 - you from a few months to a few years
14:18 - depends oh really and what's going on my
14:22 - man yeah I think I'm gonna be doing more
14:26 - videos on my personal I'm starting like
14:29 - a personal brand on Rafa Kazi and so I'm
14:31 - gonna be doing a lot more business
14:34 - related videos on that channel because
14:36 - when I started posting them here they
14:38 - just were not performing well at all
14:40 - because most people here are not really
14:43 - most people that clever programmer are
14:45 - really interested in business are more
14:47 - interested in Python and freelancing so
14:50 - I'm gonna make this channel more
14:52 - specific to that but more like personal
14:56 - brand Rafa Kazi content I'm gonna be
14:58 - talking about like making my first
15:01 - million dollars I'm doing a series on
15:05 - that I am talking I'm gonna talk about
15:07 - like how I grew and skilled my business
15:09 - I'm gonna talk about how I actually
15:12 - worked on clever programmer and taught
15:14 - people at scale and everything so the
15:17 - content and my personal brand is gonna
15:19 - be more business related and I'm gonna
15:21 - talk about like how a lot of other
15:22 - developers are killing it too because
15:25 - the teaching industry is really huge so
15:27 - like john sonmez from
15:29 - simpleprogrammer.com all on udemy is
15:39 - doing really well and CEA's dojo and
15:41 - suraj Raval and shawn something and
15:45 - coding phase and the list of coding
15:48 - celebrities and people who are teaching
15:50 - coding online it's just massive now you
15:51 - know before it used to be just like the
15:53 - new Boston and that was kind of it and
15:55 - now it's just so many people it's insane
15:59 - yeah easy thank you bro
16:02 - yeah I'm not I'm almost there easy
16:06 - almost there so I'm making a series
16:09 - called road to my first million and I
16:12 - like we as a whole company are very
16:15 - close you know we have very small profit
16:18 - margin but
16:19 - cuz we just invest in the whole business
16:20 - like constantly I have a team of people
16:23 - we're creating content so the expenses
16:27 - are also really high like over like
16:30 - $30,000 a month in expenses so it's
16:33 - pretty intense but we're focus just all
16:37 - on growth we're keeping no profit we're
16:40 - just reinvesting back into the business
16:41 - and like growing it the name of the new
16:46 - channel will just be Rafa Kazi I think I
16:49 - still haven't made the channel yet and
16:51 - hey what's up Nicolas how's it going oh
16:53 - people are messaging me on Instagram
16:55 - let's see okay I'm gonna start getting
17:05 - on a few calls so somebody is I'm
17:09 - getting on a call with a Hellmuth Feroz
17:11 - he deemed me on Instagram so I'm just
17:15 - hitting him up if he doesn't pick up
17:20 - then we're gonna move on to the next
17:21 - person he didn't join
17:31 - okay let's go to Hari
17:40 - all Hildur says I'm currently working at
17:47 - McDonald's while I'm studying but I
17:50 - would really like to freelance or teach
17:52 - programming on the side you're helping
17:54 - me so much with that yeah perfect can
17:58 - you jump on a call with me or Lillian
18:02 - you can message me like I would like to
18:05 - get on a call with Hildur and/or Willian
18:09 - so again Instagram is clever cause II
18:13 - you can DM me there but yeah that's
18:17 - really smart man how you're working in
18:20 - McDonald's and then you're you're
18:21 - studying and then you're also trying to
18:23 - like freelance you can you can be using
18:25 - those platforms that I showed you and
18:27 - you can be earning a good income on the
18:29 - side like you can be earning a really
18:31 - good income you know you definitely one
18:34 - to two thousand dollars like that's not
18:35 - that hard you can grind you get one
18:38 - client they'll you like let's just say
18:40 - you landed one client for $35 an hour
18:43 - and then you just work your way up you
18:46 - know I'll open up Google Docs and let's
18:50 - just let's just [ __ ] talk let's just
18:53 - talk through some of the math so
18:58 - freelancing software I'm gonna sing math
19:03 - alright so I'll share my screen here
19:08 - I'll zoom in so you guys can see okay so
19:13 - let's say you get okay like that you get
19:19 - one client at $35 an hour okay whoops
19:30 - okay let's let's even be more
19:32 - conservative let's just say $25 an hour
19:34 - people on wise and take lessons all
19:37 - these platforms charge higher again if
19:39 - you're in a different country just
19:41 - please dude do the if you're another
19:44 - country like I'll just make a note if
19:47 - you are not in United States
19:54 - just Google equivalent platforms and
19:59 - convert the dollars into your own
20:04 - currency okay so for example like $25 an
20:09 - hour might you might have difficulty
20:13 - charging that another country if you're
20:15 - working with the local person and you're
20:17 - not working with somebody from the US so
20:19 - then just do whatever is like gonna be
20:21 - good income for you like I know for if I
20:23 - know that my cousin's indifferent like
20:25 - in Pakistan literally make like 200
20:27 - dollars a month and they're super happy
20:29 - so just do the math and then convert it
20:33 - I'm just gonna speak for the US market
20:35 - okay like my whole talk is gonna be
20:37 - specific so then convert it into your
20:39 - own thing all right so if you are doing
20:44 - if you have a client and you're making
20:45 - $25 an hour from one client and you can
20:49 - you call him or something he keeps
20:51 - calling me okay so let's say you're
20:55 - doing 25 an hour now for hours so like
21:01 - let's say you have four sessions so one
21:04 - session you get paid 25 right $25 cool
21:11 - now generally what I like to do is I
21:13 - like to do like like one and a half
21:17 - session so if I'm working with the
21:19 - client instead of doing like doing 25
21:24 - I'll do one one and a half session like
21:27 - one session but make it one and a half
21:29 - hour long so each of my sessions
21:32 - teaching someone coding would be 1.5
21:38 - hours okay and really what that means is
21:42 - that means I'll also I can charge them a
21:47 - little bit higher so I might charge them
21:50 - like let's just say you can charge them
21:51 - 35 okay so for 1.5 hours
21:55 - you might charge them 35 you might give
22:00 - them a little bit of a discount you know
22:03 - okay so
22:05 - this is what you're charging one client
22:08 - now generally you meet with each client
22:11 - once a week so if you meet them 4x a
22:18 - month that's tell you five times four
22:21 - that's a hundred and forty dollars from
22:25 - one client okay 140 times 12 that's
22:34 - gonna be over the course of a year so
22:38 - one client is four for one year okay
22:55 - okay so now I know a lot of you guys are
22:59 - going to college and or a lot of you
23:02 - have to like pay off the college debt
23:04 - it's such a easy way to do this guys
23:07 - it's such an easy way to pay off your
23:08 - college debt another thing I want to
23:10 - mention is well I pretty much got a
23:15 - master's education without paying for it
23:18 - like I went to Oakton Community College
23:21 - but I got a masters education because I
23:24 - had a client John Navarro if I can find
23:29 - his profile in LinkedIn this was the
23:31 - client that I was working with one on
23:33 - one and you can see him on LinkedIn
23:36 - right here and I started working with
23:40 - him and he was going for his Masters of
23:43 - Science in analytics so he was going to
23:46 - school in Chicago as well because I was
23:51 - teaching him coding and he was paying me
23:52 - for it
23:53 - I was getting his education because
23:57 - every time he had a project he would
23:59 - share it with me so then I could work on
24:01 - it and try to help him he learned it on
24:03 - his own I didn't do the work for him but
24:05 - I helped him through the process okay so
24:10 - that's kind of the main thing I want you
24:14 - to get out of it like your
24:17 - you're getting an education as well when
24:20 - you're teaching other people and you can
24:22 - save a lot of money potentially like if
24:25 - you're getting a master's education the
24:28 - master's education you know might be
24:32 - worth 50 K plus and if you're just
24:36 - teaching somebody they're literally
24:38 - paying you like how absurd is that
24:40 - they're literally paying you to get a
24:43 - masters education so that's pretty crazy
24:45 - to me okay so one client for you is 140
24:50 - right if you scale that up and how it
24:52 - just depends it's just up to you if you
24:55 - scale that up to ten clients right or
25:01 - you increase the number of hours that
25:03 - you're putting in with each client like
25:05 - sometimes you'll have a client and you
25:07 - can put in two to three hours at a time
25:09 - with them so you're charging them fifty
25:11 - or seventy-five or a hundred dollars per
25:13 - session right so then you have a little
25:16 - bit more leverage but in this case if
25:19 - you have let's say five clients that
25:24 - will be 700 a month and it'll also be
25:35 - oops 1688 now this is just like
25:54 - okay so like this is a pretty good side
25:57 - hustle you know you can from just a few
26:00 - clients you could be scaling into eight
26:02 - thousand four hundred dollars a year but
26:04 - if you now start playing with the levers
26:06 - where you're charging a lot more hourly
26:08 - and then you're doing a lot more hours
26:11 - and then you have a bunch of clients now
26:16 - you start getting into levers where you
26:19 - can be really scaling your income but
26:21 - honestly for most of you guys if you're
26:24 - even bringing in five to eight thousand
26:27 - dollars on the side extra in a whole
26:30 - year
26:31 - alright let's just say in a whole year
26:32 - you're bringing that that's pretty damn
26:35 - good and you don't have to drive to
26:41 - drive uber to make your money you are
26:45 - making your income while working on the
26:51 - most on the most important skill which
26:56 - is gonna be one coding and two
27:00 - freelancing so those are like the most
27:03 - important skills I guess right so you're
27:08 - getting two really amazing things out of
27:10 - it which to me is really fascinating
27:13 - because if I'm improving in both at the
27:16 - same time that's really amazing right
27:18 - and bonus is bonus is you're getting a
27:21 - free slot free education because you'll
27:28 - have clients we're going to coding boot
27:30 - camps like you left clients are going to
27:32 - dev bootcamp you're have client who are
27:35 - going to what is it coding dojo you'll
27:40 - have clients for going to a full-stack
27:42 - Academy like all those big boot camps
27:45 - you know coding
27:49 - food camps right thankful
27:54 - you'll get clients from thankful you get
27:56 - clients from coding dojo if I were you
28:00 - guys I would be actually in a coding
28:02 - boot like if you want to be smart what I
28:06 - would do is this I've been I've actually
28:08 - joined thankful I've been through their
28:10 - boot camp but it's a pretty cool boot
28:11 - camp but what I would literally do is I
28:14 - would join the boot camp thankful pay
28:17 - it's like five hundred dollars a month
28:18 - or something okay I would join the
28:22 - coding boot camp thankful then I would
28:25 - just help everyone wherever I could and
28:27 - then I would just land clients from
28:29 - within it from thankful like you'll get
28:32 - really high-quality clients and you know
28:34 - they're they have the money to pay you
28:35 - because otherwise they can't join the
28:37 - program think for thankful all right so
28:41 - that's just one example of being
28:43 - creative but if you don't even want to
28:44 - be creative you're on wise and just
28:46 - apply like to 20 to 50 people a day if
28:50 - you started doing that you're gonna see
28:52 - good results let me come back and just
28:56 - see where everybody's at okay
29:20 - Wow okay could you do a video on how to
29:27 - get the best freelance jobs yeah I've
29:30 - done some videos around that I have some
29:34 - videos around that for sure online
29:44 - uh-huh
29:47 - huh Tony sue says stalking you before I
29:51 - sleep
29:51 - perfect
30:08 - always could always go on google hangout
30:12 - or such yeah oh really and I yeah I'm
30:21 - not sure how to get you to call on my
30:25 - phone wondering here's a good thing that
30:29 - we can do I think I think this is pretty
30:31 - smart so I'll try this give me a second
30:36 - I'll do this I have a good idea I'm
30:49 - gonna get a link for you guys where you
30:51 - can actually leave me a voice message
30:53 - and then I can answer that for you and
30:56 - also turn it into a podcast which is
30:59 - pretty cool so like provide valued a lot
31:02 - of people at scale and then people will
31:04 - also get to hear your voice but yeah
31:12 - hopefully I'll be able to figure out how
31:14 - this thing works
31:26 - okay
31:35 - all right so here it is I'm gonna drop
31:38 - this link in the chat here it is leave
31:44 - me a voice message so I just dropped a
31:50 - link you can actually leave me a voice
31:52 - message there and if you leave me a
31:55 - voice message there you can kind of ask
31:57 - me whatever type of question you want
31:59 - business-related or coding related and I
32:03 - will try it my best to answer it for you
32:05 - and it'll turn into a podcast which is
32:08 - gonna be pretty dope the page is gonna
32:12 - look something like this it'll look
32:17 - something like this and then I think you
32:19 - just kind of pick your pick your mic and
32:23 - then you just hit start recording now
32:31 - all right William Kurt says hey how's it
32:39 - going working at Walmart but would like
32:41 - to learn to code in freelance I would
32:43 - also like to do some work for your guys
32:45 - company to work for an experienced
32:46 - developer teacher is worth it awesome if
32:49 - you want to work for us William like
32:51 - definitely send us an email or message
32:53 - me on Instagram like just connect with
32:56 - me one on one that'd be the best and
32:59 - then I'll jump on a call with you yeah
33:03 - so learning to code freelance it's a
33:05 - very important skill my man it's gonna
33:06 - be really helpful if you get down both
33:10 - of the skills by teaching it you don't
33:13 - have to be like super experienced you
33:15 - can start teaching it like kind of right
33:16 - away so I think you're gonna win if you
33:18 - do that I want to share an idea with you
33:21 - guys one of the things I'm really
33:23 - interested in doing is I want to do a
33:25 - live almost like a television type of
33:29 - coding show so what that means is and I
33:33 - don't mean like live isn't on YouTube
33:35 - that would be cool too like I would I
33:38 - think I would like to do that but what I
33:39 - mean is like a documentary series where
33:44 - any of you guys come in to Los Angeles
33:48 - where
33:48 - Matt and for the first few people I'll
33:53 - offer like a free boot camp and I
33:56 - actually might do that for a lot of
33:57 - people so I'll just be like
33:58 - complimentary the only thing is that
34:01 - I'll record it with my team and so we'll
34:03 - document the entire experience but it'll
34:05 - be me working with you in person on
34:08 - teaching you coding skills and also
34:11 - helping you with freelancing so you'll
34:14 - kind of get the best of the both worlds
34:17 - hopefully and we'll work together on
34:21 - things so I think that could be
34:23 - something really really dope I've had
34:27 - this idea my friend Adil helped me come
34:29 - with that come up with it and then I
34:30 - wanted to just run it by you guys and
34:32 - ask you what do you think is this
34:34 - something that we should do is it
34:35 - something I should actually do yeah and
34:41 - yeah if you guys come to like you know
34:43 - later what I'm gonna be doing is like
34:45 - creating application form for everybody
34:47 - to apply and then like anybody who wants
34:49 - to be a contestant on the show can apply
34:52 - and then once they're selected they get
34:55 - to come in and work with me for like
34:58 - again I won't charge them and we just
35:02 - work like all-in we go all in and then
35:05 - work together on it I think that could
35:06 - be something really cool okay which
35:10 - course should take shady yeah tons of
35:16 - online Python courses my man if you just
35:18 - google it on YouTube I have a free
35:21 - course as well you can take that it's
35:22 - really good they're a good place to find
35:25 - practice projects yep
35:26 - mic practice projects if you go to my
35:28 - Python course on YouTube it's pretty
35:31 - good to start off with same answer for
35:35 - you Salman Ahmad
35:43 - how to improve your coding seal without
35:45 - freelance saying polo again free courses
35:48 - on YouTube a spirited how many time will
35:53 - it take to earn 1k for a complete
35:55 - beginner it really depends in my new
35:59 - course I say it can take you six weeks
36:02 - or more but if you're you really grind
36:05 - hard you don't have to be in my program
36:06 - you can just grind out hard apply to
36:10 - these platforms put your head down in
36:12 - code and it's yeah it's very possible
36:15 - for you to be on your path to earn 1k
36:17 - even if you don't earn 1k in this first
36:20 - six weeks you can get your first client
36:22 - in that time Tony sue okay awesome my
36:27 - man like if you want to do it let's do
36:29 - it like send me I need like send me your
36:35 - ticket details to Los Angeles and I
36:37 - think you set somewhere around July
36:39 - something anytime after July 25th is
36:42 - fine and you can come in for two to
36:45 - three days and we'll kind of go from
36:46 - there but I think it'd be phenomenal but
36:49 - again you guys have to afford like the
36:52 - flight you'll have to pay for your stay
36:57 - like hotel you'll have to pay for like
37:00 - you know all your own expenses you'll
37:03 - have to pay for all of your own expenses
37:04 - but outside of that I would love to just
37:07 - work with you in person and if you're
37:12 - like an incredibly qualified applicant
37:15 - and maybe we can have an exception but
37:17 - if you as long as you cover your
37:19 - expenses you'll be golden like the only
37:23 - person eyes I said could come and work
37:27 - for me work with me and I'll actually
37:30 - pay for their expenses was I went to
37:33 - Chicago just recently and I ran into a
37:36 - clever programmer fan and I ran into him
37:40 - in person he's 16 years old and his
37:42 - little brother is 10 years old and they
37:44 - watched clever programmer content like
37:46 - every day and they're coding and they're
37:47 - hustlers and they're starting their own
37:48 - YouTube channel and then I met them it
37:51 - was amazing and then I met their
37:53 - parents that was amazing and then I was
37:55 - like you know what if you guys come in I
37:57 - will do it for free for you guys like
37:59 - I'll pay for your expense for staying
38:02 - here and everything and then I'll
38:03 - actually help you guys so those kids
38:06 - were really really phenomenal easy says
38:11 - that's phenomenal great idea getting
38:13 - ideas raw from the people at your boot
38:15 - camp yeah man I just really want to
38:17 - connect with everybody that's in the
38:19 - community like it just feels weird like
38:23 - I realized that I don't want to make
38:26 - content and put it out there when I
38:29 - don't actually get that like I want to
38:32 - meet you guys in person and that gives
38:34 - me just so much oxygen in so much life
38:36 - like every time I do a group coaching
38:37 - call or I get to speak with you guys in
38:40 - person or one on one or in a group
38:43 - whatever it may be but that interaction
38:45 - is amazing like right now this is great
38:47 - too cuz you're able to chat with me but
38:49 - it's so much better if I can just speak
38:51 - with you in person and the more in
38:54 - person the better so like my dream is to
38:56 - actually host a live event in LA make it
38:59 - free for everyone and then no matter
39:01 - where you guys come in from it's just a
39:03 - free event whether it's one day two to
39:05 - three days I want to just go all in and
39:07 - like teach you guys the coding skills
39:08 - freelancing the skills in like really go
39:10 - hard and like I mean in my [ __ ] like
39:13 - that's my zone of genius you know so nan
39:15 - I just go hard and I have my whole team
39:19 - to support you guys as well and
39:20 - everybody on my team is a [ __ ] genius
39:22 - you know these guys are much smarter
39:25 - than I am
39:26 - so that would be phenomenal that's
39:30 - something I really want to do and the
39:32 - more live connection I feel from the
39:35 - people is just unbelievable cuz internet
39:38 - makes us like really fake reality where
39:40 - things are views and likes and
39:42 - subscriber counts and I just don't feel
39:45 - it and it doesn't make me want to like
39:47 - do anything but the more I feel like the
39:50 - energy the more amazing it is the more
39:53 - exciting it is and the more I want to do
39:55 - and I want to help out in any way or
39:57 - shape or form that I can tony soo cool
40:03 - once you mark it down
40:06 - send me the in send me the picture of
40:09 - the flight ticket booked all right if
40:12 - you do that today even better so then I
40:14 - can lock it down in my calendar but if
40:16 - you don't do it today we won't lock it
40:17 - down in the calendar so if you're coming
40:19 - in July 27th send me the freaking thing
40:22 - DM me on IG or something I know you're
40:25 - in our new course so you can even share
40:28 - with me there but that's awesome and
40:30 - we'll we'll document that journey like
40:37 - this I wanna I want to go deeper because
40:40 - I'm kind of tired of making like top
40:42 - floor programming languages to learn top
40:44 - three programming languages to learn
40:45 - like top six programming languages to
40:49 - learn to get a freelancing job without a
40:51 - college degree and it's like I that type
40:56 - of content like it kills my soul a
41:00 - little bit every time because it's
41:09 - something that like so surface-level
41:11 - that it's not exciting there's no depth
41:14 - to it but then it'll go and get two
41:17 - million people into the world of
41:19 - programming versus you know just because
41:21 - of how algorithms work sometimes versus
41:23 - like some of my deepest content that
41:25 - actually takes our team months to make
41:27 - and you know I bring in like a decade of
41:31 - experience into something and I just go
41:32 - all-in and that will get like about 1500
41:36 - views and max out and so then it's a
41:38 - mixture of how deep do I want to go how
41:42 - wide and then how wide and right now I
41:46 - want to find that balance but even if I
41:50 - keep creating content that's like more
41:52 - to just reach out to more people in
41:54 - general I want to have a way to reach
41:56 - out to you guys for like actually here
41:59 - and you care for this and I care for you
42:02 - and you care for me like I want to be
42:03 - here with you and go as like take it a
42:06 - lot deeper you know so that deep level
42:09 - is what I really really that I want to
42:12 - bring to this you know cuz I think
42:13 - that's just that was just missing there
42:16 - was just width in it but it's it was hot
42:19 - and yeah so that's kind of what I'm
42:23 - excited about
42:26 - easy awesome just sent a voice message
42:29 - cool I'll take a look at that William
42:33 - says did it okay cool William that's
42:36 - awesome I'll take uh let me see if those
42:40 - voice messages are if I can listen to
42:43 - them from my computer or I think I have
42:49 - to login from my phone so let me
42:52 - actually login from my phone and and
42:54 - hear those and maybe I can just answer
42:56 - those voice messages for you guys like
42:59 - right now so let me just take a look at
43:01 - that okay podcast logout login
43:17 - cool podcast oops that wasn't it
43:39 - sorry guys just give me one second I
43:41 - think this will be some good stuff in
43:43 - these voice messages and I think it'll
43:45 - bring value to everyone here um why
43:52 - aren't you checking voice message yeah
43:53 - I'm going to check to frighten how
43:54 - gaming hub damn eric says damn I'm at
43:58 - work
43:58 - replay hey Eric Eric Williams that's a
44:02 - very interesting way of spelling Eric by
44:05 - the way what's there behind you on the
44:13 - board just business stuff we're focusing
44:22 - on a lot of growth so we're running ads
44:24 - now and we're doing all kinds of stuff
44:26 - to like really because we've been
44:28 - grinding forever so now we want to make
44:31 - sure the content actually gets seen and
44:33 - people people get value from it and all
44:35 - of that okay now I'm here now I just
44:38 - have to see you where the heck are the
44:41 - voice messages okay I see the voice
44:43 - messages okay guys so here is the so
45:06 - here's a message from easy I'll play it
45:10 - and then I'll answer it for you when it
45:21 - comes to ask me coming to code like what
45:27 - are you doing like on find solutions
45:29 - like in coding problems I'm what you
45:32 - call Stack Overflow or like platforms
45:36 - like that to actually solve your coding
45:39 - problems that too busy with it like it's
45:40 - really frustrating you spend so much
45:42 - time trying to get answers to something
45:46 - that you're stuck on yep
45:49 - what do you do then yeah yeah that was a
45:56 - very easy question I love that so I will
46:02 - create the podcast and answer it live at
46:05 - the same time so that'll actually be
46:07 - really really cool and then once the
46:09 - podcast is out by the way the podcast is
46:12 - called clever programmer so I'm starting
46:13 - up the podcast too and so I'll answer
46:16 - the question here and in the podcast as
46:21 - well so let's just do it at the same
46:23 - time question was what do you do when
46:32 - you run into a coding problem and you
46:34 - can't solve it and if you run if you
46:36 - stack overflow it or github it or
46:40 - whatever Google it and in any way clora
46:43 - none of those platforms actually help
46:45 - you out and you're kind of stuck what do
46:48 - you do is then that's a phenomenal
46:50 - question and here's what you do you go
46:54 - to up work or you go to Fiverr or you go
46:58 - to code mentor and you pay somebody to
47:02 - help you now let me explain it's not the
47:08 - first thing that you do alright the
47:10 - first thing that you do is you actually
47:12 - work hard on that problem I'm assuming
47:15 - you already have done that you spend
47:17 - hours and hours on that problem you try
47:20 - to solve it
47:21 - take a walk that helps a lot to like
47:25 - clearing your brain out I spend a lot of
47:28 - time on that go and ask your peer group
47:31 - for help sometimes the problem that you
47:35 - get stuck into there's um but if you
47:38 - spend a lot of time and a lot of energy
47:40 - and you are just stuck and I'm talking
47:42 - like you have tried ok I'm talking you
47:44 - spent eight hours and you couldn't
47:46 - figure it out at some point there's is a
47:48 - huge diminishing return that ends up
47:51 - happening and it's really really
47:55 - detrimental to just kind of stick
47:58 - through it because after a certain point
48:00 - you're not learning anything
48:02 - for example let's say that the pygame
48:06 - package that you installed or the
48:08 - anaconda you were trying to install the
48:11 - Jupiter Python notebook and it just
48:13 - wasn't working or you try to install and
48:17 - a lot of people who code you know this
48:19 - problem you try to pip install a goddamn
48:22 - package and it just doesn't install and
48:25 - it just doesn't work that is a type of
48:29 - problem that is not very helpful for you
48:33 - to actually get past and solve and work
48:35 - through and just crying through you're
48:36 - not gonna have this big learning
48:38 - advantage from it what's actually a lot
48:41 - better at a certain point is just to
48:43 - hire somebody to explain it to you
48:44 - because I remember I had this one PI
48:46 - game I was trying to make the PI game
48:48 - module work for like a year and a half
48:50 - no coding tutorial taught me none of the
48:53 - environment things things that I did
48:55 - work it just wouldn't install on my
48:57 - Apple computer in my Linux and no matter
48:59 - what I did so after one and a half year
49:02 - of trying finally I went to this one
49:05 - meetup or somebody was like much better
49:07 - than I was and just helped me install it
49:08 - right away and make it work in the first
49:11 - try and I what I realized was I didn't
49:14 - learn so much from them installing it it
49:16 - was just a stupid thing I was stuck on
49:18 - it was just stopping my growth for no
49:21 - reason at all so the reason why I
49:23 - mention go to a teacher and have them
49:25 - teach you like on a platform a platform
49:27 - like take lessons why is that literally
49:29 - pay them because you can ask them to
49:33 - teach it to you in a way where you
49:35 - learned so don't tell them like don't
49:37 - just give me the answer make me work for
49:39 - and understand so little bail give you
49:41 - enough clues and point you in the right
49:42 - direction so you can still have that
49:44 - mental breakthrough but saves you a lot
49:46 - of time this is very very important
49:49 - because the common problem ice like look
49:54 - if you want to become a developer and
49:57 - you want to go the traditional route
49:58 - whether you want a freelance or you want
49:59 - to do full-time right if you want to go
50:00 - the traditional routes it's gonna take
50:05 - you like three years to get your first
50:06 - job that's on average what it takes most
50:08 - people two to three years four years
50:11 - maybe
50:12 - if you want to save your time and get
50:15 - there faster well what you do right now
50:19 - let's say you have zero experience so
50:20 - you're at the bottom another person has
50:23 - let's say ten years of experience once
50:26 - you start paying that person to help you
50:28 - you start you start giving them some of
50:31 - your money and then you start improving
50:33 - your skill a lot faster then if you just
50:37 - kept that money saved for yourself
50:40 - you're leveraging time and money and
50:43 - you're making a trade-off because money
50:46 - is a replenishable resource time isn't
50:48 - so I what I did is every money that I
50:52 - made from chests so I would teach chess
50:54 - for fifty dollars an hour
50:56 - thirty-five dollars an hour I you know
50:58 - worked my way up you know just to prove
51:02 - to people like my not prove but like
51:06 - it's it's kind of cool I feel like so if
51:08 - I go to chess tastic I have this whole
51:10 - brand around chess and you know I've
51:14 - been coaching I was coaching for five
51:15 - years a website I have a blog I have
51:19 - like bunch of students that I worked
51:21 - with and they got trophies and all that
51:23 - [ __ ] which is super cool
51:25 - I've handled I've handled a class of 60
51:29 - kids for eight hours a day for two
51:34 - months in the summer and it was kids
51:37 - from six years old to 12 10 or something
51:41 - like that and I have a youtube around
51:44 - this too I have a YouTube channel around
51:46 - chest anyways back to my thing so what I
51:51 - would do is everything that I learned
51:55 - from chess and all the money that I was
51:59 - making from my chest the $50 I would
52:01 - make I would pay a developer $25 to
52:05 - teach me for that one hour then I
52:08 - started thinking of it like every time I
52:10 - charge a client $50 that's two hours
52:13 - that's one hour of my time and if I hire
52:17 - a developer at $25 an hour to teach me
52:20 - coding that's two hours of a
52:22 - professional developers time so everyone
52:26 - our of my time I bought 2 hours of a
52:29 - professional developers time then when I
52:32 - increase my hourly rate to say $75 an
52:35 - hour for every 1 hour of my time I got 3
52:38 - hours of a developer's time you see this
52:43 - way I was able to leverage time and
52:45 - money on the arbitrage of underpriced
52:50 - knowledge and I would just massively
52:54 - scale my skill set in a much quicker
52:57 - time that's why I was able to start
53:00 - landing jobs in 3 months to 6 months
53:03 - time of me starting to code this is why
53:06 - like I don't think a lot of people
53:08 - understand this but I started teaching I
53:11 - started learning coding in to2015
53:15 - started working in 2015 started scaling
53:19 - it with freelancing in 2016 2017
53:24 - I started clever programmer and that
53:27 - blew up and then this is 2019 now I've
53:30 - been working on that so I've only like I
53:33 - had very little coding experience except
53:36 - by spending a lot of time into coding
53:39 - and then leveraging all my money from
53:40 - chess and transferring it to get coding
53:44 - skills from professional developers who
53:46 - taught me laser sharp precise skills
53:48 - that I needed I was able to improve
53:51 - faster than most people so one to two
53:53 - years of my coding time is equal to most
53:56 - developers like five to eight years like
54:00 - literally five to eight years so that is
54:05 - what I would say if you can't find the
54:06 - answer on Stack Overflow you hire
54:11 - someone to help you and help you with
54:16 - the breakthrough that's the answer
54:31 - okay so we got Easy's question we got
54:36 - the answer that's pretty dope it's gonna
54:39 - be going to alright hopefully that was
54:46 - helpful easy so I'm just going through

59:16 - cool
59:26 - Eric Williams says I stepped out of work
59:28 - real quick bro I love the video did
59:30 - about your lifestyle with programming
59:31 - hella motivation while I'm grinding I'm
59:33 - a computer coding also I'm working at
59:35 - building my network with other
59:37 - programmers and potential job
59:38 - opportunities in LinkedIn yo Eric that
59:41 - is super smart my man yeah that's super
59:47 - super smart bro like reaching out to
59:52 - people on LinkedIn is so powerful and
59:54 - just people don't get it like I will
59:57 - show you guys it's really really cool
59:59 - and I don't even take that much
60:03 - advantage of it but I think everybody in
60:05 - here should so like go to LinkedIn type
60:09 - in Python alright and you will literally
60:17 - find people around here okay look at
60:20 - this advanced Python people results for
60:24 - Python and you start getting like
60:26 - results let's go see all and let's just
60:29 - go through some of this okay here is
60:32 - Matthew para Python and JavaScript
60:35 - developer and you can just hit you can
60:39 - eat so now let's click on his profile
60:45 - and let's see he's a freelance Python
60:48 - developer exactly where most people want
60:50 - to be take your web application of the
60:52 - next level with Django platform cool
60:54 - capable of developing and maintaining
60:56 - web back-end awesome great worked as a
61:01 - JavaScript freelance developer so doing
61:03 - both at the same time JavaScript and
61:05 - Python cool okay he's done some stuff
61:11 - with video too so I'm looking for
61:16 - something relevant to speak to him on so
61:22 - my okay so you get a few messages that
61:25 - are free and then after that you got to
61:27 - pay but I honestly think like it's so
61:29 - worth even paying for this because you
61:32 - can just message this person like just
61:35 - last week I messaged this person
61:37 - and she's a Python and Django developer
61:43 - and I was actually on one of these live
61:46 - group calls and I just reached out to
61:48 - her and I was like Hello a rock-like
61:50 - Python and Django developer web
61:52 - developer freelance self-employed so I'm
61:55 - like I was showing everybody in the
61:57 - group that it's really easy and then I
61:58 - just hit connect and then I sent her a
62:00 - message and then I just said right here
62:04 - I was like hey just scrolling through
62:05 - and saw that you went to dev bootcamp
62:06 - that's pretty epic I have a few friends
62:08 - that went to that boot camp I'm becoming
62:10 - a Python Django developer myself I'm
62:12 - curious what made you go there I'd love
62:13 - to chat and hear your story
62:15 - do you have five minutes to chat okay so
62:18 - easy and then she's like what she
62:21 - responded literally that same minute
62:23 - which is crazy and she goes sure are you
62:25 - in Chicago so I wasn't in I wasn't in
62:28 - Chicago at the time I was in LA but guys
62:32 - it's like really easy it's really
62:33 - powerful you can connect with people who
62:35 - are literally doing the jobs that you
62:37 - want to do and then you can just reach
62:40 - out to them and then you can start
62:42 - working with them or you can literally
62:44 - like like would you like do you know how
62:48 - amazing it would be to grab a coffee
62:50 - with people who are developers and just
62:52 - build relationships with them and not
62:54 - even ask for anything in return that's
62:56 - the biggest mistake most people make
62:57 - your to need like a lot of people come
63:00 - off to needy and too desperate so if you
63:02 - meet these people without that weird
63:05 - neediness and desperation and you just
63:08 - like build relationships with developers
63:10 - and if you're creative you can even
63:11 - start like a podcast for developers but
63:13 - let's not get that creative let's just
63:15 - say you want to do something like simple
63:17 - like freelancing you build a
63:18 - relationships with these people you'll
63:19 - know exactly what kind of jobs you have
63:21 - to would you you know exactly what kind
63:23 - of skills you have to develop you under
63:25 - start to understand exactly what type of
63:27 - skills you need to actually succeed and
63:30 - you they can actually put you in those
63:34 - jobs and help you get those internships
63:36 - so let's get out of here go back so I
63:41 - think it's very very powerful guys like
63:43 - super powerful I can't emphasize it
63:47 - enough
63:55 - funky says profitable programmer 3.0 so
63:58 - yeah profitable programmer right now
64:00 - we're in the 2.0 version and that
64:03 - program is between 400 to 500 dollars
64:05 - just depends when you join that program
64:08 - sometimes we have a good pricing for it
64:11 - going otherwise it's gonna be 500 so
64:15 - yeah okay eric says network with other
64:18 - programmers and potential job
64:19 - opportunities LinkedIn Eric that's just
64:21 - so smart my man you like most people are
64:23 - just not on that they don't understand
64:25 - the power of LinkedIn and building those
64:27 - relationships cool what else we got Eric
64:37 - yeah I can reach out to people awesome
64:38 - Thank You dev dungeon if you can be
64:42 - interviewed message me on instagram
64:45 - please so my Instagram is clever cause E
64:48 - and DM me there and give me context
64:52 - because I'll forget who you are
64:54 - so message me and say like interview as
64:57 - for a develop as a developer and then
64:59 - I'll interview you and we'll share your
65:02 - story on this channel or if you know
65:06 - developers you can put me in touch would
65:08 - that'd be great - yeah Hildur yeah you
65:13 - started teaching Python you're gonna see
65:14 - yourself growing from just even teaching
65:18 - it so that's powerful like you're
65:20 - currently in the Opie part of Python
65:22 - even though it's free yeah you're gonna
65:24 - grow a lot my man's got to come back to
65:31 - YouTube
65:32 - no Tenzin is not here with me he's in
65:35 - Chicago but he'll be here July 10th
65:38 - through 14th for my birthday see na if
65:44 - you don't know anything about coding
65:45 - where would you start from I would start
65:47 - from a free coding course online and
65:50 - then go from there
65:51 - Tony that's good advice cool
66:00 - okay Osama says a video on nodejs it's
66:03 - more trendy cool that could be fun -
66:05 - yeah scene developer how to contact you
66:08 - either email or message on Instagram
66:14 - okay and I'm gonna see what other I
66:17 - think we got some other voice messages
66:19 - too so I'll take a look at what other
66:21 - voice messages have we gotten William
66:33 - sent a message online but I'm trying to
66:46 - see that what I've been doing is not
66:49 - really something just totally interested
66:50 - in but from just watching my videos and
66:53 - hearing you talk about different things
66:54 - I think coding has a great interest and
67:01 - for me and I believe like as long as I
67:05 - keep following some routines that you
67:07 - guys are playing online so I kind of
67:10 - want to be taking I guess as a student
67:14 - and looking into more as a professor or
67:17 - instructor because honestly I feel like
67:19 - you're probably better than some people
67:21 - they do have as trying to teach it and
67:23 - the different universities and colleges
67:25 - and stuff so I plan to keep in touch and
67:30 - just follow you know the things that you
67:32 - guys got and hopefully become like a
67:35 - mastermind at that it I think it just
67:41 - cut off William okay so I just cut off
67:47 - but okay so William thanks for that yeah
67:50 - we're putting in we're grinding a lot
67:53 - and I do want to turn it into a
67:55 - mastermind I want to start off by doing
67:57 - boot camps with you guys I think that
68:00 - would be phenomenal that would be like
68:01 - one of my favorite things to do let me
68:07 - add this to the podcast as well
68:10 - add message to the thing and then I'll
68:15 - go and record my voice cool so yeah like
68:18 - turning it into a mastermind would
68:20 - actually be really unbelievable turning
68:23 - it into a bootcamp that I do live would
68:25 - you guys would be amazing anything where
68:27 - it's live and I want to connect with you
68:29 - and we can connect one-on-one or in
68:31 - person would just be phenomenal so
68:33 - that's really where I want to take
68:36 - clever programmer to and I'm gonna start
68:38 - like pretty soon sending out
68:40 - applications for people to actually book
68:44 - an event and come out to LA and do
68:48 - something live here cuz that would be
68:51 - just like the most unbelievable goal all
68:57 - right let's see if we have another
68:59 - question and yeah guys so I dropped that
69:04 - link earlier for anchor I'll drop it
69:07 - again and you can drop me your question
69:17 - right there
69:24 - let's see if we're getting bunch of
69:27 - messages okay that was awesome question
70:11 - we're gonna answer it right now
70:15 - okay so Philip Eldin aka Hilda in the
70:19 - live chat asked I am trying to make my
70:22 - dreams come true I'm currently working
70:23 - at McDonald's how can I increase and get
70:26 - more side income and then ultimately not
70:29 - depend on my parents
70:30 - Hildur phenomenal question my man look I
70:35 - think you're doing a lot of things right
70:36 - you're already working and trying to
70:38 - earn an income you're already studying I
70:40 - remember from your comments earlier
70:41 - again I would emphasize you need to
70:44 - start going on those platforms I keep
70:46 - mentioning about wise ant take lessons
70:50 - Craigslist
70:52 - people per hour up work freelancer
70:56 - Fiverr whatever they are
70:58 - like make profiles on all of them it'll
71:01 - take you 45 minutes to make profiles on
71:03 - all of them and so that will be like the
71:05 - most profitable 45 minutes of your life
71:08 - you know or if not of your life then
71:10 - definitely you know important to help
71:14 - you boost up your side income and then
71:17 - reaching out on those platforms on a
71:19 - daily basis because I'm telling you my
71:23 - man it's not as hard as people make it
71:25 - out to be if you learn some skills like
71:27 - your three to six months of actual
71:29 - coding skills and you've put your nose
71:31 - to the grindstone and you put in the
71:33 - work you actually work hard you will
71:37 - succeed you will be able to help
71:38 - everyone who is behind you who has one
71:41 - month of experience in two months and
71:42 - three months and four months you'll be
71:44 - able to help them all you really need to
71:46 - be just one step ahead of the other
71:48 - person in the movie catch me you can't
71:51 - catch me if you can which I think is
71:52 - based on true events this one guy was
71:54 - teaching this I think what is it
72:00 - sociology right he's teaching like
72:02 - sociology class an advanced one which he
72:05 - didn't know about and he was replacing
72:07 - he was trying to fake act like this big
72:09 - professor and nobody caught him ever and
72:12 - he taught the entire semester there and
72:14 - he wasn't the real professor and when
72:17 - they asked him like how were you able to
72:19 - get away with that how did you do that
72:20 - he said I was
72:21 - I always just read one page ahead of the
72:23 - students and then I would teach that as
72:25 - a lesson that is usually what teaching
72:28 - can be if you are it doesn't mean Europe
72:30 - you have to be a fraud it just means
72:33 - that if you're ahead one step ahead
72:35 - you're actually even more relevant to
72:37 - the person who's behind you because you
72:39 - know the mistakes they make you know
72:40 - what they feel and you just learned it
72:43 - yourself so you might actually be the
72:44 - best teacher my teacher who was the best
72:46 - teacher for me in chess he actually
72:49 - sucked in chess I became better than him
72:51 - after one month but he was actually the
72:53 - most amazing teacher because he inspired
72:55 - me to become an incredible incredible
72:58 - chess player you know I'm top 1% now in
73:01 - a very short amount of time in the world
73:02 - so that's what I would say like really
73:05 - really like learn those skills really
73:12 - well and then once you learn the skills
73:14 - teach and teaching will help you boost
73:17 - up your side income and you will be able
73:19 - to make one to two thousand dollars
73:21 - extra in month a month if not more in
73:24 - income and then yeah you don't have to
73:27 - because if you're taking an income from
73:29 - your parents you'll have to do what
73:31 - they're saying as well so if you start
73:33 - making your own income you can then
73:35 - start to make your own decisions you can
73:36 - still you can still love your parents
73:38 - and you can still make them really happy
73:40 - but you have to make your own decisions
73:41 - if I was getting money from my parents I
73:44 - wouldn't be able to make the decision to
73:45 - drop out of college to go all in too
73:48 - clever programmer and to start this
73:49 - company and just
73:50 - our teaching coding at scale but because
73:53 - I was making my own money
73:54 - I was able to make my own decision
73:56 - because if I took the hell it would be
73:57 - my L it would be my loss and it would
74:00 - have nothing to do with my parents so
74:01 - you have to own up to that
74:03 - responsibility so you know you really
74:06 - want to make it come true bro start
74:08 - hustling grinding build the thing on
74:10 - those platforms this way you only be
74:12 - improving your coding skills you'll be
74:13 - making an income you'll be and you'll be
74:17 - like freelancing okay and you're getting
74:18 - education at the same time that's what I
74:21 - would say for you bro okay um hey cause
74:36 - you know my long comments yep brilliant
74:38 - wouldn't be sure I could make a short
74:40 - video getting to the point would need
74:42 - time to go over it right now I'm a bit
74:43 - just got fired for working 24/7 or
74:45 - iliyan yeah you don't need to make a
