00:06 - but we're building the cart page of
00:08 - amazon clone 2.0 right
00:10 - look at this uh look at this out so
00:12 - we've built this yesterday

00:35 - we're using firebase as well to be able
00:37 - to populate all of these items that you

00:50 - inside on the home page
00:52 - it will automatically populate it in
00:54 - here and kind of make it into like a
00:56 - live a website right so that every
00:58 - single time you got to cart
01:00 - it shows up in here this total cost is
01:02 - going to update
01:03 - from firebase this numbers are going to
01:06 - update as well

02:31 - open with live server
02:34 - i'll do one more time there we go this
02:36 - is what we have right so not a lot of
02:38 - products
02:38 - you know we only have like one product
02:41 - right here i know a lot of you guys who
02:42 - did are doing the amazon challenge you
02:44 - probably have a few products now at this
02:45 - point
02:46 - uh maybe like 30 or 20 or 100 maybe like
02:49 - one or
02:50 - two you know depending on how you like
02:52 - it um
02:53 - and now we're going to be working on
02:55 - working on building the cart page
02:57 - today and then tomorrow we're working on
03:00 - actually building
03:01 - you know the the whole thing which is
03:03 - using firebase grabbing data
03:05 - uh pulling data showing all the pro all
03:08 - the items
03:09 - um and yeah all right so
03:13 - my friends hope you doing good
03:17 - hope you're ready let's just get started
03:19 - all right
03:21 - a few things we've done this now in
03:24 - order for us to get started on the card
03:26 - page
03:26 - what do you guys think we should do
03:28 - right now all right
03:29 - i want you guys to put in the chat those
03:31 - of you who are on zoom i want you guys
03:32 - to put in the chat so i can see all you
03:34 - guys
03:34 - let's see that's right i need to add the
03:37 - card button
03:38 - of course but mainly what i'm going to
03:40 - do is i'm going to create a new
03:41 - html page so new file and i'll say cart
03:45 - dot html right
03:49 - the unfortunate part about using vanilla
03:51 - javascript right now because i'm using
03:53 - the
03:53 - very very bones of javascript the
03:55 - unfortunate part is that we kind of have
03:57 - to copy and paste
03:59 - the index.html into our card html and
04:02 - explain why in a second
04:03 - okay usually you wouldn't do this but
04:06 - for now let's just make this work
04:07 - because i want to show you the most
04:08 - basics basics
04:11 - all right let's make sure that come on
04:14 - let's make sure that there's nobody
04:15 - who's talking okay or let's just a model
04:18 - has please mute everybody
04:20 - and so nobody can unmute themselves
04:21 - please okay
04:23 - [Music]
04:25 - that means they're all good thank you
04:26 - monique okay all right
04:28 - in that case what i'm going to do is i'm
04:30 - going to in this card html
04:32 - i'm going to copy everything from here
04:36 - into card html okay
04:39 - right there so copy your init.html
04:42 - copy this one command a or ctrl a and
04:45 - then you want to do
04:46 - command v or control v right depending
04:49 - what you have
04:51 - let's do that and now we have basically
04:54 - the same pages we have inside the
04:55 - initial.html
04:57 - now but in order to get to this page now
05:00 - i want you guys to look right here
05:01 - see this says index.html go to that one
05:04 - and then change it
05:05 - to jar card.html
05:10 - right there all right
05:13 - okay let me go and make sure that you
05:15 - guys are all here i'm see i'm on it
05:21 - you all right
05:24 - jesse please um yourself jesse actually
05:26 - no you're merely you're good
05:27 - all right so i just met everybody sorry
05:28 - guys i just made it everywhere so we're
05:30 - all good
05:31 - all right now we're curling the card
05:35 - page right but of course
05:36 - nothing really changed nothing really
05:39 - changed
05:40 - so to change it what we need to do is
05:42 - we're going to keep
05:43 - this sidebar the same right
05:47 - and we're going to keep this navigation
05:48 - bar the same as well right here
05:51 - the one thing we're going to change is
05:52 - what is just basically this portion of
05:55 - the product itself right
05:56 - right so in order to do that what do we
05:59 - need to delete
06:00 - to only delete this section you guys
06:04 - tell me in the zoom
06:05 - what do you delete delete only that
06:06 - section
06:08 - the banner no the whole that's right
06:11 - same here the whole main section
06:13 - so if i go down to here
06:17 - we have that one this is the main
06:20 - section right
06:20 - if i go ahead and make this smaller it
06:23 - shows me all the things we have we have
06:25 - the main section deals the main section
06:26 - categories and the banner right
06:28 - that's all in there so all i have to do
06:30 - is just simply
06:31 - highlight this whole thing okay
06:34 - click delete and that's it we're good
06:38 - want to delete once you click save now
06:41 - it's all clean
06:42 - all right the first thing that we're
06:44 - going to do is we're going to just
06:46 - simply
06:46 - change this bg gray to bg white
06:50 - there we go so it's a white color okay
06:53 - and then the next thing we need to work
06:55 - on
06:55 - is what is it what do you guys think
06:57 - what do you guys think is the next thing
06:58 - that we need to work on to make this
07:00 - fully work i want you guys to put that
07:01 - in the chat well
07:04 - what is it it's going to be the header

07:30 - do so jessie here
07:33 - jesse though
07:36 - okay i should say h1 that's correct
07:39 - julian h1
07:41 - and what kind of styling would you give
07:43 - it if you look
07:44 - back to the 2-win documentation
07:46 - [Music]
07:48 - how would you style this up exactly you
07:52 - could give it a fun
07:53 - bolt or a text to xl
07:56 - you know to determine the size of it and
07:59 - you could give it that green
08:00 - color correct that's right so let me
08:03 - connect
08:05 - in the meantime maybe you could start
08:06 - typing that already nice
08:08 - yeah so let's go ahead and create an h1
08:10 - so we'll do
08:12 - by the way is the song good is it do i
08:14 - keep the music should i turn it off let
08:15 - me know in the chat guys
08:16 - should i keep the music or turn it off
08:18 - it's like it's like pretty
08:20 - is it good it's chill
08:23 - okay it's chill
08:26 - keep a little a little bit less
08:30 - a little bit softer softer is that good
08:34 - all right yeah it's lower a little bit
08:35 - yeah okay it's good so let's go ahead
08:37 - and create an h1 right here
08:39 - all right and that h1 is going to be not
08:41 - no class right now but it's going to be
08:43 - the shopping cart right now so
08:44 - shopping oops right here
08:48 - put that shopping cart
08:52 - shopping cart inside here the cart okay
08:55 - so let's go ahead and save that let me
08:58 - go back to amazon 2.0 and here we have
08:59 - the shopping cart of course
09:01 - let's start styling this shopping cart
09:02 - okay well a few things need to happen
09:04 - with this shopping cart
09:05 - the first thing is go ahead and make a
09:07 - text gray for 100 so let's do a class
09:10 - right again we're using tailwind css
09:12 - remember that guys text gray
09:15 - right 400 save so it changes the color
09:19 - next thing we're going to do is give it
09:21 - a larger text so we'll say text
09:24 - dash 3 xl all right
09:27 - and then we'll do a margin bottom 6
09:29 - because we want to push it to the bottom
09:31 - so you see how there's margin here in
09:32 - the bottom
09:33 - so just so you guys know by the way guys
09:35 - margin
09:36 - is a space under is basically the space
09:39 - around the box
09:40 - so if i have the box right here you see
09:42 - this
09:43 - the margin let me just show you guys
09:44 - some a lot of you guys have questions
09:45 - around that
09:47 - so the margin is basically spacing
09:51 - above it below it underneath it like
09:53 - this
09:54 - to the side well padding is a space
09:57 - inside of it
09:58 - okay so once you guys just to keep that
10:00 - in mind so padding is inside
10:03 - margin is what is it outside
10:06 - that's right okay beautiful
10:10 - so we got the text three excel so it's a
10:11 - little bit larger now let me take a look
10:13 - at it
10:14 - x3 xl save it nice beautiful let's make
10:17 - a little bowl so we'll say font bold
10:19 - inside the piece of code
10:22 - font font-bold
10:25 - and yes i know you probably want me to
10:27 - wrap to wrap
10:29 - at this point so i will get i'll do the
10:31 - word wrapping now
10:33 - okay right here so we got the font
10:36 - bold all right
10:40 - we got the phone bolt that's looking
10:41 - exceptional right oh hi jesse jesse is
10:43 - trying to
10:43 - steal our code hello fun bold
10:47 - then honestly that's pretty much it uh
10:49 - mb6 is gonna be
10:50 - mmb six for margin bottom six all right
10:54 - so got the shopping cart also good next
10:56 - up is what
10:57 - is going to be this section which is let
11:00 - me see here
11:02 - uh let me see you here which is going to
11:04 - be this section right here
11:06 - how do you think we should create this i
11:07 - want to ask you this a question
11:09 - where do you want me to put this in
11:13 - what is it guys what is it
11:16 - well it's a dip that's correct so let's
11:18 - go and put that into a div
11:20 - div and no class for now just an empty
11:22 - class
11:23 - okay i am humble just going to call this
11:26 - class
11:26 - a main or a like table titles for
11:29 - example like maybe
11:31 - you know table dash titles why table
11:34 - titles because
11:35 - you know this is technically like a look
11:37 - at i think of it as a table
11:38 - all right then that's pretty much it
11:41 - inside the table titles
11:43 - we have three things we have and what
11:46 - are those
11:47 - they are the headers so we're going to
11:50 - do an h2 in here that one h2 is going to
11:53 - be a product
11:55 - right okay another h2
11:59 - is going to be a what a count
12:04 - and then the third h2 is going to be a
12:06 - what
12:08 - what is it it's going to be a total cost
12:11 - right and they're going to create these
12:13 - specific product
12:15 - count and total cost okay so
12:18 - that's just kind of that all right save
12:21 - that and let's see what we have so far
12:23 - we've got product hi jesse
12:28 - product count total cost
12:31 - right now we need to of course modify
12:34 - this
12:34 - currently they are from top to bottom
12:36 - but we need to make that from
12:38 - left to right how does that work what do
12:40 - you guys think
12:42 - that's right it is going to be using
12:44 - something called flex and if you guys
12:45 - want some good information on flex if
12:47 - you just type in flexbox
12:49 - inside your google search if you type
12:51 - that in
12:52 - go to complete guide to flexbox right
12:56 - this is the only thing you need to learn
12:58 - around html i'm not going to lie
13:00 - if you want to learn css you go to here
13:03 - and you learn flexbox honestly
13:05 - that is it guys right the only thing you
13:08 - need to learn
13:09 - this tells you exactly how you should be
13:11 - for example
13:12 - you know uh displaying things in what
13:14 - direction
13:16 - in what column how to wrap things how to
13:19 - center things right
13:20 - here you see so save the website go to
13:23 - flexpod it's from css tricks
13:25 - save it it's really really good alright
13:28 - let's continue
13:29 - to make sure it goes from left to right
13:31 - we're going to call it flex
13:35 - save that all right and honestly that's
13:38 - that's that's pretty much it okay so
13:39 - flex
13:40 - all right i'm going to i'm going to go
13:42 - ahead and call it a um
13:44 - i'm going to give it a full width of 100
13:46 - so let's do let's do a bg dash
13:48 - uh yellow dash 500 just for now
13:52 - so you guys can see what's going on the
13:54 - width is full which is good
13:56 - which is good let's go ahead and give it
13:58 - a font bold so everything is fun to bold
14:02 - font dashboard save that now everything
14:05 - is bold
14:06 - all right let's now go ahead and do text
14:09 - great let's give
14:10 - the different tickets to text
14:13 - dash gray that's what that's 400
14:17 - right there okay and
14:20 - honestly that's pretty much it okay now
14:23 - you see
14:24 - so it's the weird you know weird color
14:26 - but that's all right don't worry about
14:27 - the word color
14:28 - right instead we're going to worry about
14:30 - is how do we make sure that
14:32 - hey this card total is on the right hand
14:34 - side and this total cost is on the right
14:36 - hand side as well
14:37 - how do we do that because if you see
14:39 - here like
14:41 - these you know take up a certain
14:43 - percentage or a certain
14:45 - uh a certain width right here see
14:48 - and so do does the product okay
14:51 - so does the product now
14:54 - to fully understand how we do that well
14:56 - it's kind of like this
14:59 - we we're going to give this column
15:02 - a fixed width and this column a
15:06 - fixed basically width you see but
15:09 - then we're going to give this column the
15:12 - ability to stretch as much as possible
15:14 - right because you can see if i stretch
15:16 - out my page you see
15:17 - what stretches does this stretch or no
15:20 - time in the chat does this stretch or no
15:24 - not necessarily okay does this stretch
15:26 - or no only the product
15:27 - that's right does this stretch or no
15:30 - that's right
15:31 - just the product is what stretches
15:34 - so if we want to repeat that
15:38 - all we do is just we use flexbox to
15:40 - repeat that
15:42 - so for the product what do we say guys
15:44 - for the product we're going to stretch
15:45 - it right so
15:46 - to make it stressful we say this class
15:48 - equal to flex
15:49 - dash grow this is what happens
15:53 - again if i go to here and i say flex you
15:55 - see it says flex girl right here
15:57 - right let's grow is what's allowing a
16:01 - div to expand as much as it possibly can
16:05 - as much as it can take up the space all
16:08 - right
16:08 - that's flex grow then
16:11 - for the h2 for the com we're going to
16:13 - get a fixed width so i'm going to say
16:15 - class
16:15 - is equal to w dash 48
16:19 - remember not 2 38 but w
16:22 - remember i know remember with the width
16:25 - right it's width dash the number that we
16:27 - want to use that's using tailwind css
16:30 - okay then next one we're gonna oh jesse
16:33 - is in let's go
16:35 - then okay just sorry taking over i'm
16:37 - like holy she's like she's just
16:38 - waiting to take over the computer
16:42 - so then we have h2 class of w48 as well
16:45 - right
16:46 - okay which is right here so we got that
16:49 - and next up what we're going to do
16:51 - is we're going to create the card items
16:54 - but before i do that
16:56 - let me refresh this for you and you can
16:58 - see that it's going to look pretty good
17:00 - that means i can remove this whole bg
17:04 - yellow 500
17:05 - so you guys can see more clearly save
17:07 - that
17:08 - all right are you guys still with me you
17:11 - guys still with me yes or no
17:14 - yeah you guys are beautiful all right
17:17 - next up
17:17 - is the cart items because remember these
17:21 - are the card items that we're going to
17:23 - be showing
17:24 - so jesse let's go and create a div
17:26 - that's going to show us the card items
17:27 - jesse okay
17:29 - are you still here all righty
17:32 - yeah yeah i'm here i'm here so so go
17:34 - ahead that said
17:36 - um let's go and make the class known
17:40 - still inside of the main section so
17:42 - still here
17:43 - i'm gonna make a div class i'm going to
17:45 - call it cart
17:47 - items and
17:50 - let's define that first okay make the
17:52 - div
17:53 - boom and inside of the div guys what are
17:56 - we going to be making inside of that
17:58 - div one our card item correct
18:02 - and what does that card item contain
18:06 - well contains an image contains
18:09 - yes so it contains an
18:13 - image okay what else contains the
18:16 - product details
18:17 - about it uh-huh okay
18:20 - product details a counter a cart
18:24 - item details okay what else
18:28 - it contains the counter
18:31 - it contains a counter um
18:35 - yeah well is it this class yeah it's
18:38 - this class
18:39 - diff class counter whoops
18:43 - contains the total card
18:46 - and then the total that's right cost
18:51 - all righty e e
18:54 - last
18:58 - total cart item i'm gonna call it
19:02 - cart item total cost so guys we didn't
19:06 - we did with the name of your classes you
19:08 - want to be as consistent as possible
19:10 - because if your app becomes really big
19:12 - it's easier to read
19:13 - if you have a certain style to it to
19:15 - your names okay
19:16 - yeah so that's very important card items
19:21 - and we also have that little cross
19:25 - where is that oh that one that's uh
19:27 - that's right the delete one right which
19:28 - is this one right here
19:30 - yeah this one yeah yeah that's right so
19:31 - we're also gonna add that in later so
19:33 - we're gonna say div class
19:36 - cart item delete
19:40 - okay so guys this is your structure
19:43 - for the card items each card item will
19:47 - have
19:47 - all of these elements okay so
19:51 - let's first start off with
19:54 - of course the image right but
19:57 - i want us to be careful because jesse
19:58 - because we put all these details
20:00 - outside the card item so we want to make
20:02 - sure that we put it inside the cart item
20:04 - right
20:05 - so he wait that's a very good
20:08 - yeah good catch that's true you see how
20:10 - we have the card item right here
20:12 - but all these elements are right here is
20:13 - that you want to put all of this inside
20:16 - boom right there boom nice good good
20:19 - good
20:20 - right so make sure you guys do that here
20:22 - at your home as well
20:24 - okay that's looking good and so we've
20:27 - got so far nothing so far
20:28 - okay nothing so far
20:31 - she's going to create a div class card
20:34 - image card item image
20:35 - yeah and we can actually have that image
20:38 - in there
20:40 - okay so what are we buying today
20:43 - i know we're buying i know i know i got
20:46 - it i got it i know what i want to buy
20:47 - oh i know i know we're buying the apple
20:49 - macbook pro let's go
20:50 - the m1s the um m1 chip yeah i like that
20:53 - one oh that one's amazing
20:55 - i love it that's the one i'm using to
20:57 - stream everything right now
20:59 - oh yeah yeah i'm also coding with what
21:02 - it's crazy
21:02 - okay so you go ahead let's go go ahead
21:06 - so guys just like yesterday okay
21:09 - you're just gonna open up the image tag
21:11 - like this
21:12 - have the source and you're just gonna
21:13 - look up that
21:15 - the address of uh a
21:18 - macbook or m1 picture okay
21:22 - like like this now
21:26 - if we open up the browser now i don't
21:29 - think it's going to look good
21:30 - let's see i got this it's probably
21:32 - looking really
21:34 - is it oh yeah yeah now we're buying one
21:37 - humongous macbook pro
21:41 - doesn't even exist i love it it's the
21:43 - biggest macbook pro that exists on the
21:44 - planet okay
21:47 - so let's style this one up okay so first
21:50 - of all
21:51 - let's check this with the class itself
21:53 - with the image
21:56 - no let's make a diff around it and we
21:58 - already have a div around it
22:00 - okay the card item image div that's
22:02 - right so
22:03 - let's give it a white of 40 and a height
22:06 - of 24 and to make it
22:10 - look really like goes seamlessly into
22:12 - the background which is also white we're
22:13 - going to give it a background of white
22:16 - hey let's go and we're going to give it
22:18 - a padding
22:20 - of four okay
22:24 - and we're gonna round the edges
22:28 - okay we're gonna round the edges
22:32 - nice okay good now what you wanna do if
22:35 - you have a diff
22:36 - around your image you always want your
22:39 - image to
22:40 - fully take up space inside of that div
22:42 - so what you do is
22:44 - you style up the clock the image okay so
22:46 - you can say image class
22:48 - with full height full
22:51 - and guess what object contain
22:55 - that's right so what's going on in this
22:57 - situation like this is basically
23:00 - what's going on is basically we're
23:01 - creating this div and i want to show you
23:02 - guys what's going on
23:03 - we create this dib right here okay
23:07 - then we tell the image hey you know what
23:09 - make sure the height is
23:11 - a hundred percent and a hundred percent
23:12 - of width and height of that
23:15 - of that there right and then we say you
23:17 - know what
23:18 - make sure do by using this whole thing
23:20 - of object contain
23:22 - this tells the image you know what make
23:25 - sure you can also you can actually see
23:26 - the object because sometimes
23:28 - either the object gets cut off because
23:30 - of the different aspect ratio
23:32 - or the object is stretched which is not
23:34 - right as well so
23:36 - what we want is just contain it inside
23:38 - and that's what that allows us to do
23:40 - yeah exactly and i made it purple so you
23:43 - guys can see the div class around it and
23:45 - what it actually does but i'm gonna
23:46 - change it back to white again okay
23:51 - so now the image is good i do think it's
23:54 - a little bit close
23:55 - to the top
23:59 - or the top is closed too
24:02 - so let's give card items
24:05 - let's give margin top okay
24:08 - five plus hmm
24:12 - okay let's continue let's continue
24:14 - further with the card items
24:17 - item details so what do we see there we
24:20 - see
24:20 - a title that we bought on ipo pro apple
24:23 - macbook
24:24 - plus we know of course that the brand is
24:28 - apple
24:28 - okay so what i'm going to do inside of
24:31 - card item
24:32 - details i'm gonna make two other div
24:34 - classes okay
24:36 - i'm gonna first one i'm gonna call it
24:37 - card item title
24:39 - let's first start off with that one okay
24:43 - so there's some delay hello
24:48 - i need i need to type the div myself
24:50 - close it up okay apple
24:52 - macbook pro 13.
24:56 - and here i'm going to give the other i'm
24:59 - gonna make the other div class okay
25:01 - carts item brand
25:04 - okay oh now it is okay
25:07 - thank you and the brand is of course
25:10 - apple
25:11 - that's right okay so let's style that
25:14 - one up because now it's just
25:16 - i think just play letters plus it's not
25:20 - vertically aligned i think or is it
25:23 - so let's go and save that let's see so
25:26 - if i go to amazon right there
25:27 - it's not vertical line instead it's like
25:29 - oh yeah
25:30 - it's like bad so guys who knows
25:33 - what should be done in order to get
25:36 - those items
25:37 - next to each other instead of vertically
25:39 - like i mean at this point
25:41 - i think they should notice if they do if
25:42 - you don't know this
25:44 - i don't know what to do with you okay
25:47 - don't say that not don't say that i'm
25:50 - kidding but like
25:51 - if you don't know this i don't know
25:54 - no the question is how can you find out
25:57 - if you don't know this
25:59 - that's right actually that's right
26:00 - that's right that's right that's right
26:03 - kevin is like everybody's like i don't
26:05 - know jk i don't know they're like
26:06 - i don't know but it's like they're like
26:08 - they're scared
26:11 - they don't dare to tell us otherwise
26:12 - i'll give them more homework
26:14 - that's right this is a good idea
26:16 - actually
26:18 - so that said guys how to
26:21 - do this okay so you want to make
26:24 - something like this you always want to
26:25 - make it
26:26 - well sometimes you want to make it
26:27 - visible you know so let's say we make
26:30 - the card item we give it a certain color
26:32 - i like that purple color actually okay
26:34 - did you notice
26:36 - yeah so let's say this is the purple
26:38 - this is the card item
26:41 - and this is actually are you seeing it
26:44 - are we seeing it
26:45 - yeah we got it are you saving it
26:48 - yeah i got it so
26:51 - this is the card item guys and actually
26:53 - so you want to give this card item what
26:56 - a flex of course because if you give it
26:58 - a flex
26:59 - boom everything will have the direction
27:02 - of a row
27:03 - okay so let's do that let's give it
27:07 - a flex okay which stands for flex
27:10 - display flex
27:11 - and the default value of this reflex
27:13 - always roll okay
27:15 - and of course once we do that boom you
27:17 - will see it line up next to each other
27:21 - let's see come on come on come on there
27:23 - we go
27:24 - nice oh there we go plus we want it
27:28 - vertically aligned in the center so
27:30 - what's what's the property for that guys
27:32 - it's
27:32 - items uh hyphen center
27:36 - okay and that's it basically
27:40 - that's it now to be a little bit
27:43 - um to be very specific let's give it
27:46 - some padding bottom okay
27:50 - and that's it so let's style up the
27:52 - details now
27:54 - all right so for the
27:57 - title let's make it a fun bold
28:00 - okay fun ball so guys i'm inside of the
28:03 - card item details and i'm
28:05 - styling up the title so pay attention
28:07 - here okay fun bold
28:09 - i'm gonna give that a small text okay so
28:12 - text hyphen sm
28:13 - and i'm gonna make it gray so text gray
28:17 - 600. okay
28:21 - awesome and
28:24 - oh oh no it's all good so good container
28:27 - it's all good
28:28 - yeah and then text also small text for
28:30 - the brand
28:31 - and we're going to give that also a gray
28:33 - color but a little bit lighter than the
28:35 - one before so instead of 600 we're gonna
28:37 - do
28:37 - 400. okay
28:40 - and that's it for the um
28:44 - so let's remove that purplish
28:48 - that beautiful purple color okay boom
28:51 - nice that's looking really good that's
28:53 - really really good jesse nice job
28:55 - nice job so yeah yeah nice job so
28:59 - at this point you guys have done the
29:00 - details you guys have the card image
29:02 - that's already done
29:04 - what you guys can do is now what work on
29:07 - the counter right this is going to be a
29:09 - little more difficult because now you
29:10 - have to focus on having creating these
29:11 - two buttons
29:13 - right you need to create this text and
29:15 - then of course needs to be some kind of
29:16 - a hover on these two buttons
29:18 - now these two buttons are what's going
29:19 - to control
29:21 - how many items you have right so if you
29:23 - want to have 20 of them or maybe you
29:25 - have 230 of them
29:26 - i'm guessing you probably won't have 20
29:28 - macbooks but who knows maybe you just
29:29 - have a lot of cousins
29:31 - okay that works too you know
29:33 - [Music]
29:34 - i'm the youngest in the family so i'm
29:37 - kind of lucky that way
29:39 - there you go all right so let's go ahead
29:40 - and make that one work now
29:43 - yeah for sure for sure so let's get into
29:45 - it so counter
29:47 - and first of all always start off with
29:49 - the easy part okay guys so we know that
29:52 - there is
29:53 - one time right so i'm going to give that
29:55 - an h4
29:57 - and do like this oh is that like that
30:00 - like this okay boom basically it's there
30:04 - however let's style this up okay h4
30:07 - class
30:08 - text gray whoops text gray 400.
30:12 - that's it that's the times one can we
30:15 - see it
30:16 - on the screen of course we can oh yes we
30:19 - can
30:19 - i really just i really think you need to
30:22 - implement autosave
30:25 - but yeah oh you don't have the autosave
30:27 - no okay
30:29 - that's okay so yeah we have it right
30:33 - there it's x1 right here it's just very
30:34 - like in the corner which we don't like
30:37 - no we don't like that no so
30:40 - but that said we
30:44 - need to style up the counter because
30:48 - uh we have to give that of course a
30:51 - width
30:52 - like before okay so
30:55 - let's style up the counter the card item
30:58 - counter
30:59 - part here so remember guys when so i'm
31:02 - gonna go to the top
31:04 - look here at line 105 remember
31:07 - this column count was set on
31:11 - a width of 48 and the column next to it
31:14 - was also set on with a 48 that said
31:18 - these widths here are fixed but the
31:21 - column the first one about product
31:23 - that one can grow as much as it
31:26 - can you know as much space has been
31:28 - given so but that said because we're
31:31 - working on the counter
31:33 - column we also have to set the width
31:35 - here
31:36 - okay so with 48
31:39 - boom and of course we're going to give
31:42 - it a flex here
31:44 - and item center so my one and
31:47 - two chair fronts will be nicely
31:50 - vertically
31:51 - or uh aligned okay
31:54 - so the one she's talking about by the
31:55 - way is you're talking about these
31:56 - chevrons you see this right here
31:58 - so we're going to let's go and maybe
31:59 - create these chevrons first and then we
32:01 - can showcase just how necessary the flex
32:03 - is jesse
32:04 - right right right right okay so the
32:06 - chevron
32:07 - um this time we got them from um
32:11 - font awesome we got them from font
32:13 - awesome
32:14 - so awesome
32:17 - okay and then we're going to say chef
32:19 - ron to the left
32:23 - and then inside of this div i'm going to
32:25 - put in
32:26 - that font awesome see chef ron which is
32:30 - like this guys and as you can see
32:35 - it has a class of f a hyphen
32:38 - x s on the right side
32:41 - so i'm making sure that the hyphen is
32:43 - really small
32:44 - there you go beautiful beautiful okay so
32:47 - now if we see it now if i say
32:50 - we have a div that's just there
32:55 - no no no no i removed it i removed it so
32:58 - i'm gonna remove it right now so hold on
33:00 - save it there we go now we have a
33:02 - chevron on the left inside
33:03 - let's go and create a chevron on the
33:04 - right hand side now
33:10 - yeah and we have to
33:14 - i think we have to add on the card items
33:17 - detail
33:18 - like we did with products we have to add
33:21 - a flex girl to that
33:26 - why is that jesse
33:29 - because um oh yeah
33:32 - right i should have done okay i'm not
33:34 - doing this in the right order i'm sorry
33:36 - let's continue yeah just keep doing that
33:38 - okay
33:39 - so yeah yeah so
33:42 - uh let's go with the right with the
33:44 - right chevron
33:45 - okay um the right chef ron the right
33:48 - chef ron
33:50 - okay so that jeffron is behind the h4
33:53 - of course so here chef front to the
33:56 - right
33:57 - boom why is it not
34:01 - strange and then inside of this saffron
34:03 - of course we're also going to have that
34:04 - chef from class but instead of left
34:06 - guess what it is right okay
34:10 - like that there we go
34:14 - nice nice looking really good looking
34:16 - really good
34:18 - awesome a a right
34:21 - okay let's style that up let's style
34:23 - everything up okay
34:25 - so that said um
34:29 - the cursor the chevrons they're not
34:31 - really they're not really doing anything
34:33 - about they're just
34:34 - chef runs now okay so let's give it a
34:36 - cursor pointer
34:39 - and let's also make it gray so text
34:43 - gray 400 oh hyphen 400
34:48 - okay and we're gonna give it a little
34:50 - bit of a
34:51 - background yeah okay that's right so
34:54 - this is the box around the chef front
34:55 - guys because look at
34:57 - your line this is a diff class
34:59 - surrounding the chef ron
35:01 - right okay so pay attention to that
35:02 - that's why your indentation here
35:04 - is so important okay so background gray
35:08 - and oh let's round it a little bit
35:12 - say rounded okay how does it look now
35:17 - let's see let's see nothing so far i
35:19 - think you change the color do you guys
35:21 - oh no we do see i just i don't see on my
35:22 - cam on my on my screen
35:24 - but yeah it's there it's there it's kind
35:26 - of oh okay
35:27 - cool yeah okay we just need to give it a
35:30 - width
35:31 - bigger maybe give it a height of six and
35:34 - a width of six
35:36 - okay nice that will change things i
35:39 - think
35:40 - let me see i'm not seeing it on your
35:42 - browser yeah i see it though
35:44 - i see it yeah oh yeah boom
35:47 - there we go and look to center the
35:51 - the chevron inside of that little gray
35:53 - box of course
35:55 - flex justify center you guys know the
35:57 - drill
35:58 - items center nice all righty that is
36:02 - nice
36:03 - okay uh yes there you go plus
36:08 - no i think this is it for now plus or
36:11 - do you want to add the hopper already on
36:13 - it no it's all good just continue going
36:15 - with the other chevron
36:17 - okay okay so actually guys
36:21 - surprise surprise the right chef ron is
36:24 - gonna be the same of course
36:25 - of course okay so actually you can just
36:28 - copy paste this one
36:30 - and then copy it over the right chevron
36:33 - right class
36:35 - and then change this to right that looks
36:38 - good that looks good
36:41 - whoa
36:45 - i'm not seeing it in your browser yet is
36:47 - it changing oh
36:48 - there we go right there so now guys we
36:51 - have two buttons we have one button
36:53 - right here
36:54 - another button right here and only thing
36:57 - to do we
36:57 - need to add the hover state so when i
36:59 - hover over something right
37:01 - it changes color so maybe it signifies
37:04 - the fact that you can actually click on
37:05 - it all right
37:06 - so let's do it right now so
37:09 - add hover which is an action okay
37:12 - hover and then bg hyphen gray
37:17 - hyphen 200 nice okay
37:21 - so let's go and try that if i hover over
37:23 - this oh
37:24 - right let's see and the coolest thing
37:26 - about tail and css
37:28 - is you can actually create this inside
37:30 - the class right away
37:31 - right and normally what you would do is
37:33 - you go to css you would do like the
37:35 - actual tag then the hover you change the
37:38 - class and so forth
37:39 - but with here by the way i can say hey
37:41 - here's my hover
37:42 - and then here's the class i want to
37:43 - change it to
37:45 - so simple and i love that that's
37:47 - probably the biggest i love about 101
37:49 - css
37:50 - you know not so sure about the whole
37:52 - thing in line html stuff
37:54 - but this very useful
37:57 - right right and also i want to add
37:59 - something very small to it to the left
38:02 - chef ron i think this is a little bit
38:03 - too close to the
38:04 - x1 and the right chevron is also a
38:08 - little bit close to the x1 as well
38:10 - so with the first chefron the left one
38:13 - i'm going to give it a margin right very
38:16 - subtle a margin right of two
38:20 - and with the right chef front i'm going
38:22 - to give it a margin
38:23 - left of two just to give some spacing
38:25 - right there see
38:26 - just to give some space so if i save
38:28 - this now there we go now it looks a
38:30 - little more spaced out
38:30 - i want you guys to remember this is very
38:32 - important guys spacing encoding is
38:34 - extremely important so whatever you guys
38:36 - are doing
38:37 - right make sure you space it out okay
38:39 - right
38:40 - so always look at how much white space
38:43 - you have there's actually a counter for
38:45 - how much white space you need to have
38:46 - so make sure that you are seeing that
38:48 - this is why you can't have things too
38:50 - close to each other
38:51 - this is why you need to create padding
38:52 - and spacing inside here and here
38:55 - if it's too clumped up together it's not
38:57 - a good website and it's not a good
38:58 - application then nobody will want to use
39:00 - that
39:01 - there's a reason for example a lot of
39:02 - these new applications or applications
39:05 - you see they're more open they're more
39:07 - open style just like it's kind of like
39:09 - even when you buy a house nowadays
39:11 - people are going for more open style
39:13 - houses
39:14 - same situation coding badly enough
39:20 - so that said
39:24 - let's go first over to cost
39:27 - yeah go ahead go ahead
39:32 - okay so cos guys very simple
39:36 - we're also going to give that just like
39:38 - the counter we're also going to give
39:40 - that a width of
39:41 - 48 okay
39:44 - and it's not so hard it's just a fun
39:47 - bold
39:48 - attacks gray okay of 400
39:54 - and that's it and how much was the
39:57 - what's the apple book macbook i think
40:00 - 1099 or something like this
40:02 - 140 yeah yeah so i think so yeah it's
40:05 - nothing like this
40:06 - that's good yeah awesome there we go
40:09 - nice look at that is it visible
40:10 - yeah it's literally right there okay
40:12 - we're gonna do the spacing and all that
40:14 - later guys okay so what
40:15 - first pay attention is we're first gonna
40:17 - fill in the details okay
40:20 - then next up we're gonna be using
40:24 - that cross right very easy just a fun
40:27 - awesome class again
40:29 - it's called times boom
40:33 - it's called times when you look at
40:34 - fallout awesome you you search for times
40:37 - and then you find
40:38 - it right there times excuse the cross
40:42 - click on that cross and then you can go
40:44 - ahead and just simply copy this html
40:46 - and then this is what jesse will paste
40:48 - since right here but of course you have
40:49 - to make sure guys you have to make sure
40:50 - that you have
40:52 - uh the actual style you see this font
40:54 - awesome style you have to make sure that
40:55 - you have that so if you don't have that
40:57 - you can actually get that by going to
40:58 - font awesome
40:59 - if you're in zoom i'm gonna paste it in
41:00 - here just in case you don't have it
41:02 - but that's the only need to have in
41:05 - order for this to work
41:07 - so guys you also just like you have to
41:10 - paste that into your index.html you also
41:12 - have to paste it into the card.html file
41:15 - okay so make sure you have that that
41:17 - font awesome link the one that nas now
41:20 - has put into the chat okay so
41:23 - that said also this one
41:27 - this this column we're going to give it
41:29 - a width of 10.
41:31 - okay we're going to give it a width of
41:32 - 10. nice
41:34 - and wait
41:39 - excuse me fun bold okay
41:43 - text gray of 200
41:47 - that's it so if i go ahead and save this
41:50 - right now
41:51 - oh cancel save save let's say oh
41:55 - look at that right so it's it's like
41:58 - right there it's like very
41:59 - light right here one thing i want to
42:00 - change this so maybe maybe like maybe
42:01 - make it like a 300 so it's a little more
42:03 - visible
42:05 - yeah a little bit better yeah and okay
42:07 - yeah
42:08 - and what i would do for this one is i
42:09 - will make a cursor pointer so i'm going
42:11 - to say cursor
42:13 - cursor dash pointer ah yeah so that
42:16 - feels like it's an actual button okay
42:18 - so by now if i click on this you see it
42:19 - feels like a button
42:21 - and what you can actually do is is on
42:23 - the hover of this button you can do
42:26 - bg or you can do what is it text color
42:30 - as a text um bold or text
42:33 - gray gray and instead of 300 let's do
42:36 - 400 maybe this time right so 400
42:40 - that way if i hover over this it seems
42:43 - like a button see
42:44 - boom see now changes to a button right
42:46 - it makes me want to click yeah
42:47 - okay it becomes darker that's right yeah
42:49 - same thing
42:51 - same thing we're going to do with this
42:52 - portion right here as well
42:54 - so if i'm going to go back to my chevron
42:57 - right
42:58 - the one class i'm going to add to here
42:59 - is going to be okay
43:01 - cursor dash pointer right
43:04 - and then also this the other side i've
43:06 - already added that dodge
43:08 - uh no i don't oh it did never mind okay
43:11 - yeah you did
43:12 - okay yeah yeah oh it's
43:15 - you know why because because it was
43:17 - curse or space point that's why it
43:18 - doesn't work
43:19 - that's why it was cursor space pointer
43:22 - so it didn't work
43:22 - okay there we go yeah that's right yeah
43:24 - yeah yeah so should this cursor dash
43:26 - pointer
43:27 - just like right here you see that way
43:29 - when i
43:30 - save this see now it's a button this is
43:33 - a button
43:34 - this is a button as a button only enough
43:36 - left to do is for us to actually
43:38 - uh make sure that give it to give it
43:40 - some spacing so just
43:41 - how do we make sure that this is all in
43:44 - line because what i like to do is i like
43:46 - to make sure that
43:47 - this is in line and then this is in line
43:49 - together with the actual cost and
43:51 - together with the actual counter
43:53 - right so how do we do that right right
43:56 - so what happened so i didn't go into
43:58 - this before because i want you guys just
44:00 - first focus on the details
44:02 - but look if we go back to
44:05 - the we go to the top you know start at
44:07 - the start i always say okay
44:09 - so we have the main section and then we
44:11 - have the product
44:12 - count total cost which was
44:16 - you know this is the three columns we're
44:17 - working with basically
44:19 - right so the first one is a flex crow
44:22 - the second one it has a width of 48 the
44:25 - count one
44:26 - the total cost also has a width of 48
44:29 - then i'm gonna add another one
44:32 - to it i added this span it's like a
44:36 - placeholder almost
44:38 - yeah and i'm this pen i'm gonna i'm
44:40 - gonna leave it
44:41 - empty okay i'm not gonna put anything
44:43 - inside of it
44:45 - but i'm gonna give it a class and i'm
44:47 - gonna give it a width
44:49 - of 10 interesting interesting so you're
44:52 - not seeing it right now but if i say
44:54 - here if i say hello
44:56 - you can see me saying hello in the
44:58 - browser
45:00 - boom there it is so
45:05 - there it is so let's remove the hello
45:08 - okay
45:09 - and as you can see guys so we got the
45:11 - flex grow
45:13 - 4848 w10
45:16 - okay that means on the
45:19 - product on the product so where was it
45:23 - um on the product we also had a flex pro
45:29 - i think right that's right we do right
45:31 - now that's it right that's right we did
45:33 - so
45:33 - what we are going to do on the product
45:35 - in that case on the card items detail
45:37 - right here the card items detail we're
45:39 - going to put a flex grow
45:41 - right because you want this to go as
45:43 - much as possible right so this div is
45:45 - going to grow as much as possible going
45:46 - to push everything
45:48 - while this is going to stay static and
45:50 - so is the rest of it is going to stay
45:51 - static okay
45:52 - and when i say static i mean it's fixed
45:54 - okay it doesn't change that's what means
45:56 - when i say static yeah
45:59 - so yeah look i made it purple so you
46:02 - guys can see it so if you guys
46:04 - if you can scratch the screen right now
46:05 - nas
46:08 - let me see right there see searches as
46:10 - much as it possibly can
46:11 - hey nice that's beautiful that is
46:14 - beautiful nice job
46:16 - so that's how you can see guys how the
46:19 - flex grow works and guess what now that
46:21 - we have card items with the flex grow
46:24 - we had the card items counter with a
46:28 - width of 48
46:29 - right there and the card's total cost
46:32 - also with a 48 so those columns are not
46:35 - moving because they got a fixed width
46:37 - yeah and guess what card item delete
46:41 - the little cross has a width of 10
46:44 - right which is exactly the same as how
46:46 - we made the first row
46:48 - here that i'm highlighting here that's
46:49 - right so that's the right that's the
46:51 - reason that's the reason how you
46:54 - right so that is the reason guys why if
46:56 - you for example make this
46:58 - right if you make this the same width
47:01 - right and then you go ahead and make
47:03 - this the same way so basically it's
47:05 - going to be like this right
47:06 - this is one width this is another width
47:08 - and then there's a placeholder that you
47:10 - don't really see that's nothing
47:11 - right it's really nothing and then the
47:14 - other columns are going to follow the
47:15 - same structure
47:16 - this is going to be a certain the same
47:17 - width there's going to be a certain
47:19 - width and so this is going to be a
47:20 - certain width right
47:21 - but this placeholder is kind of where
47:22 - she put it sure just to put hello
47:24 - right it's because it's a placeholder it
47:27 - allows us to have that axe in the same
47:29 - position
47:30 - and then this portion right here is just
47:32 - going to stretch as much as it wants if
47:33 - once you scroll this way go this way it
47:35 - wants to go become smaller become
47:36 - smaller
47:37 - right that's how we make sure that it's
47:39 - all kind of
47:40 - the same and follow the same pattern
47:44 - and honestly guys that's pretty much it
47:45 - that's pretty much it and then the last
47:48 - thing when you we only think we have
47:49 - left for this is
47:51 - we want to go ahead and just add a
47:53 - bottom border which this border right
47:55 - here let me go ahead and remove this for
47:56 - sure for sure right there so that guys
47:59 - go at the start it is of course at the
48:02 - cart item class
48:03 - because you want to have a border bottom
48:06 - after each card item
48:08 - so here at line 110 okay
48:11 - i'm gonna say border oops inside of the
48:14 - quotes please
48:15 - border hyphen b which means border
48:17 - bottom
48:19 - okay and then in tailwind that's very
48:21 - easy about tailwind
48:22 - automatically this is a border bottom of
48:25 - one pixel
48:26 - solid look at that boom right there done
48:29 - see whoa right there yeah but now it's
48:33 - kind of black
48:34 - i mean you cannot see on the screen but
48:35 - now it's actually black so to change the
48:37 - color you're going to say border
48:39 - gray um 100 which is very light
48:43 - like super subtle okay so a lot of times
48:47 - when you
48:47 - actually go and do a lot of design and
48:49 - coding you're gonna play around with you
48:51 - know very light
48:52 - grays a lot of nowadays you know gray is
48:55 - becoming a very
48:56 - um popular like color to use and so
49:00 - because it's just simple for example
49:01 - your macbook pro is gray
49:03 - right my trackpad here is gray right
49:06 - there's a reason why it's becoming such
49:08 - a popular you know um
49:10 - color and so a lot of nowadays websites
49:12 - are actually just playing with a lot of
49:14 - grays they're playing with a lot of
49:15 - different
49:16 - light grays darker gray as you see this
49:18 - is a darker gray
49:19 - darker gray more darker gray light gray
49:22 - darker gray
49:23 - you know because it just it just re
49:25 - makes things read
49:27 - uh very easily okay for the eyes because
49:29 - it stands out enough against
49:30 - white but it's not too hard for the eyes
49:32 - and at the same time it has a friendly
49:34 - minimal
49:35 - clean appearance you know like david
49:38 - says
49:38 - that's right so cool
49:42 - cool we got one card item so we got one
49:44 - card item should we add another one just
49:46 - just for the sake of it let's go ahead
49:48 - and another one well what do you want to
49:49 - buy you wanted to buy the nintendo
49:50 - switch

49:52 - want to buy that i mean because

49:57 - buy them to switch
49:59 - well but if you buy a nintendo switch
50:02 - you gotta have friends though that also
50:03 - have the nintendo switch because then
50:05 - you can all play together yeah
50:06 - unfortunately unfortunately i don't have
50:08 - friends so unfortunately i'm just really
50:09 - lonely and still sometimes you know
50:11 - so probably might not be the best
50:13 - decision for me but i do have my
50:15 - computer
50:15 - every day with this guy guys every day
50:18 - [Laughter]
50:22 - okay uh that said okay let's add the
50:26 - nintendo switch okay let's do it
50:29 - i'm just gonna i'm very minimal minimal

51:45 - there we go okay
51:49 - so i got the nintendo switch
51:52 - um i got the nintendo switch image there
51:56 - okay and then very simple guys just
51:59 - change up
52:00 - the title okay card item detail the
52:02 - first look at it okay
52:04 - 100 so card item details is the div
52:08 - inside of this this remember we have the
52:10 - title and we have the brand
52:12 - okay so nintendo
52:15 - switch okay and here nintendo
52:18 - of course and we're gonna buy it one
52:21 - time so i'm not gonna change anything
52:23 - about that
52:24 - and it was about i guess about 290
52:27 - dollars or something yeah that's cheap
52:29 - like this no it's not it's not that
52:32 - expensive for how much fun you can have
52:34 - and honestly that's pretty much it
52:36 - that's it
52:37 - yeah so look guys so clean we've gotten
52:41 - here this is honestly like you the only
52:44 - question to ask yourself
52:45 - do you understand what's going on here
52:47 - in this shopping cart like
52:48 - raise your hand if you understand what's
52:50 - going on here in the shopping cart do
52:51 - you understand how many products you
52:52 - have
52:53 - do you understand yeah very much right
52:56 - do you understand what products you have
52:59 - there we go there we go beautiful see
53:01 - it's it's
53:03 - it's a very clean design and now
53:05 - somebody said ford products
53:07 - it's that's right that's right there's
53:09 - four products in there
53:12 - so now we've got that okay there's only
53:14 - one last thing we need to do and it's
53:15 - honestly
53:16 - we're not fully done for the day once we
53:18 - finish it because there's one last thing
53:19 - i want you guys to do together
53:21 - um but it's going to be this so
53:24 - if i go to my shopping cart here and i
53:26 - go to this total cost you see this we
53:28 - need to go ahead and incorporate this
53:29 - total cost
53:30 - so let's do that right now we have our
53:32 - card item i'm going to minimize that
53:34 - just uh so that it's a lot easier we
53:37 - have a card
53:37 - right here okay and then underneath the
53:40 - card items all i'm going to do is just
53:42 - put another div
53:44 - and that's div is going to be the card
53:46 - item
53:47 - total that's it guys card item total so
53:50 - let's do this i'm going to say dave
53:53 - right here
53:54 - div class is equal to
53:58 - right is equal to what cart
54:01 - item toll
54:04 - toll or or maybe we call it better maybe
54:07 - it's like
54:08 - um complete order or something complete
54:10 - order maybe i think it's better for
54:12 - complete orders so let's do this right
54:13 - now
54:14 - complete order lead dash order
54:17 - right that's going to be our dip and
54:19 - that div contains two things the first
54:21 - thing contains it contains a total cost
54:23 - so we'll do this we'll do a div
54:27 - class is equal to what total
54:30 - dash cost all right because remember
54:32 - what's going on here is if i made this a
54:34 - little bit smaller
54:36 - it's a little smaller it's a little bit
54:38 - bigger
54:39 - there we go right what are we doing
54:42 - right now so we're creating
54:43 - this portion this portion right now
54:45 - there's a total cost section
54:47 - right you're still with me the total and
54:49 - then what what is the second section we
54:50 - have
54:51 - it is going to be the complete order
54:54 - section complete order button section
54:57 - and that's it
54:58 - so i'm going to say the total oh yeah so
54:59 - first um the first div is going to be on
55:02 - the left part like total cost and then
55:04 - the number
55:05 - and then the second part is going to be
55:08 - the
55:08 - button correct that's right jesse
55:11 - that's right okay so let's focus on the
55:15 - total cost
55:16 - total cost has a few things what does it
55:18 - have well it has
55:20 - first the actual text called total cost
55:22 - i'm gonna say h2
55:24 - so we're working on this one right now
55:26 - h2 right
55:28 - and that's going to be h2 and that's
55:31 - gonna be total cost
55:32 - right the next thing it has it is going
55:35 - to be another div
55:36 - and that date is going to be the total
55:38 - cost numbers let's say class is equal to
55:41 - total cost
55:45 - dash number boom right there okay
55:49 - and that number is right now let's just
55:50 - say for example it's gonna be a thousand
55:53 - one thousand oh jesse just got it
55:59 - 1780.00
56:00 - right i didn't count it i'm not a math
56:03 - genius actually no i am pretty good at
56:04 - math but i just didn't kind of hear okay
56:06 - i love math it's my favorite subject
56:08 - okay so there you go
56:12 - and then the last thing is just going to
56:14 - be the complete order button and the
56:15 - only text that we need to put in here is
56:17 - just simply complete
56:20 - oh there's canvas interesting all right
56:22 - it's just simply complete
56:25 - right there complete order all right
56:29 - that's it let's save that and what do we
56:31 - have so far let's go take a look at it
56:33 - that's it so nothing crazy we have one
56:36 - div right here
56:37 - another div right here so how do we go
56:39 - ahead and and
56:40 - make that from left to right right now
56:43 - sorry not i'm changing
56:44 - i'm changing the total because that
56:46 - ain't right
56:47 - [Music]
56:49 - i was looking at it i was like no that's
56:51 - not right that's
56:52 - not correct jesse is like no okay the
56:54 - number just has to be right
56:56 - no no i'm not going to allow him
56:59 - mathematics
57:00 - which one is you so total cost is this
57:03 - and complete order
57:05 - okay all right so what we want to do now
57:07 - is
57:08 - we're going to use what class in order
57:10 - to make sure that
57:11 - they go from left to right you know that
57:14 - class already right
57:14 - it is going to be flex so i'm going to
57:16 - say flex here
57:18 - and boom now the total cost is here
57:20 - complete order is
57:21 - here i'm going to give it a bg
57:24 - yellow just you know 300 for now so you
57:28 - guys can see what's going on this is the
57:29 - actual
57:30 - you know whole div all right now
57:33 - i want to make sure that they actually
57:36 - go to the
57:37 - end of the div like they're at the end
57:39 - of the dev
57:40 - and again that's going to happen how
57:42 - well yes
57:44 - that's right the end of the world okay
57:48 - if you go to flexbox documentation guys
57:51 - okay and you look up right
57:54 - justify content what can you say
57:58 - flex and you see that right there yeah
58:01 - that's right
58:04 - so the only thing i have to do is so
58:06 - that means it will go
58:08 - that means it will go to the end of this
58:10 - parent div
58:11 - but like on the horizontal axis
58:15 - look at that justify and justify
58:18 - end pushed everything towards the end of
58:22 - the actual this dip you see just like
58:24 - that
58:25 - right and then now all we have to do is
58:27 - just work on the individual
58:29 - uh you know total cost uh dips all right
58:32 - so let's do that right now one thing i
58:34 - want to do is i want to give a little
58:35 - margin
58:36 - so i'm going to do margin top 10
58:39 - to space it up from the actual product
58:42 - all right so now it's spaced out
58:44 - next up total cost hey let's go ahead
58:46 - and give it a
58:48 - margin right on my other seven
58:51 - just space it out from the complete
58:52 - order okay that's spaced out
58:55 - uh next up let's do a total cost let's
58:58 - give it a class
58:59 - of let's change the color that's going
59:01 - to be text
59:03 - text gray dash let's get a color of 400.
59:07 - 400. nice now it's different total color
59:10 - next up let's give the color for the
59:13 - 1499
59:14 - not 1780 which i think is right and then
59:19 - i'm kidding i'm kidding jesse no that's
59:22 - not right
59:23 - all right let's make it a little bit
59:24 - larger so now it's a lot a lot larger
59:26 - okay which i like
59:27 - and then let's make it a font bold
59:31 - right let's give it a font brush bold
59:34 - nice okay oh right there
59:38 - let's save that so now it's a bold font
59:40 - all right
59:41 - let's give it a bang that's right let's
59:43 - give it a text gray 600 guys okay
59:47 - yeah otherwise it's a little bit too
59:48 - much in your face i know it's like boom
59:51 - scaring you you know well otherwise you
59:52 - know probably 430 now okay never mind
59:55 - i'm not going to buy it anymore
59:57 - then probably you know amazon amazon
59:59 - will probably be bankrupt at that point
60:03 - that's why guys gray gray color okay
60:06 - imagine if your amazon card if basically
60:09 - if imagine this
60:10 - this would be funny imagine if your
60:13 - number your total number
60:14 - of what you're buying changes color
60:17 - depending how much it is
60:19 - so look if it's like over 1 000 it's
60:22 - like red
60:23 - screaming red they'll probably be broke
60:24 - at some point
60:28 - no they wouldn't want that yeah i don't
60:30 - think like look at that hold on let me
60:31 - let me say let me show you guys
60:34 - oh my god that is scary the heck no no
60:36 - thank you
60:37 - oh i know it
60:41 - no that's no good yeah okay thank you
60:43 - there we go
60:45 - okay let's remove this background yo
60:47 - because it looks hideous and i don't
60:48 - like it at all
60:50 - okay there we go much better now bro
60:53 - almost there guys almost there okay
60:55 - let's go ahead and go to complete order
60:57 - for the complete order we're going to
60:58 - make it a button remember
60:59 - to make a new button we need to create a
61:01 - a div around it which we do have already
61:04 - at this point
61:05 - right div around it and then we can
61:07 - center this text to set that dip
61:09 - all right the div that we have right now
61:11 - is complete order button
61:13 - we're going to give it number one a
61:15 - width of 56
61:17 - okay go ahead jesse yeah
61:20 - width of 656 right we're going
61:24 - we're going to give it a a flex so
61:26 - because we want to go ahead and center
61:28 - the actual text inside of it
61:30 - so let's give it a flex we're going to
61:32 - do item center to center it vertically
61:34 - and then we're going to do justify
61:37 - center center horizontally right there
61:38 - see
61:39 - so if i go ahead and do that choo choo
61:42 - right and now let's go ahead and do a
61:44 - background color to make it a background
61:46 - color we just do
61:47 - uh bg yellow 500 okay that's going gonna
61:51 - make it look like a text oh dang why are
61:52 - you typing jesse
61:54 - i don't know yeah bg yellow pg yellow
61:58 - 500
61:59 - that's right right there see okay let's
62:02 - make sure we have justify center right
62:04 - so
62:04 - justify center right there oh yeah okay
62:07 - and i'm gonna give it rounded edges
62:09 - because i find it's a little bit too
62:10 - harsh
62:12 - i like it boom plus
62:17 - text should be white i think so i'm
62:19 - going to say text
62:20 - [Music]
62:22 - white okay that's right text white
62:26 - and there's one more thing we need to do
62:29 - and that's this
62:30 - we've got the car the button right there
62:32 - it looks really good i love it it's a
62:34 - big buzz in a complete order all you
62:35 - want to do is just spend money on our
62:37 - site okay
62:38 - please spend money we need to make money
62:40 - right so the button is humongous
62:43 - okay right but i know i know
62:47 - right let's actually make it feel like
62:48 - it's a button so we're going to use
62:50 - cursor pointer
62:52 - cursor pointer to make it feel like it's
62:53 - a button that way when i hover over it
62:55 - we have the hand print
62:56 - i like to go like this in front of the
62:57 - camera
63:00 - right that's the hand print and then
63:03 - after that
63:04 - let's make sure that when you hover over
63:05 - it actually changes color
63:07 - so all we have to do is simply do bg
63:10 - dash uh b uh hover
63:14 - colon and just change the background
63:16 - color so in our case all this is bg
63:18 - yellow instead of bglo 500
63:21 - i'm going to say bg yellow
63:24 - 600 save that and now when i hover
63:28 - boom right there you see now it just
63:30 - changes color
63:31 - and this makes you feel like you want to
63:33 - click it
63:34 - right and there's a reason why it's also
63:36 - orange i don't know if you know but
63:37 - orange because orange
63:38 - i think orange color shows like trust it
63:41 - shows
63:42 - no blue shows trust anybody know what
63:44 - orange color does blue show stress
63:46 - yeah anyone know what orange color does
63:47 - uh adventure or something
63:49 - more like energy energy yeah yeah
63:53 - yeah yeah so energy so they want you to
63:55 - have energy around orange
63:57 - there you go and guys at this point we
64:00 - have
64:00 - the card done that's it it's complete
64:03 - look at that
64:05 - look you guys need to be part of
64:06 - yourself one thing you forgot is there's
64:08 - a no bg hover on this one
64:10 - let me see oh let me see i like to make
64:12 - sure it's all good there
64:14 - i know okay i'm gonna go back to my
64:18 - uh bg okay hover
64:22 - text gray copy that and put the hover on
64:26 - the other one too save that
64:30 - boom boom boom boom oh oh that looks so
64:34 - good
64:34 - i'm loving where we're going with this
64:36 - guys give yourself a lot of applause for
64:38 - where you've gone guys i've gotten let's
64:40 - go let's go
64:42 - [Music]
64:43 - hey we did it
64:48 - there we go so i'm lucky where this is
64:50 - going already
64:51 - at this point guys the card is done
64:53 - that's the only thing honestly we were
64:55 - planning on doing for today
64:57 - but i do have a few ideas on what we can
64:59 - work on so that we're ahead for tomorrow
65:01 - okay because tomorrow's gonna be pretty
65:03 - hard tomorrow is just gonna be all
65:04 - javascript
65:05 - we're gonna use firebase we're going to
65:06 - use uh you know a bunch of all these
65:09 - other
65:09 - technologies so the first thing we can
65:11 - do is we can actually
65:12 - work on this little icon right here
65:15 - right
65:16 - you see this icon right here let me show
65:17 - it to you
65:19 - so maybe just let's work on that icon
65:20 - right now okay this icon right right
65:24 - so guys open up your index.html file
65:28 - okay and we're gonna go back to the
65:30 - start
65:32 - because as you can see where is that
65:34 - card located in the header correct
65:37 - so as you can see here we have
65:40 - we have it on line
65:44 - 25 no not categories
65:47 - wait wait wait logo logo aha
65:51 - right icons not put this really nice
65:53 - comment here
65:54 - that's why guys comments are important
65:56 - okay we got the icons
65:59 - this is the heart icon boom the card
66:02 - icon so we want to have like a
66:06 - as you can see we want to have like the
66:08 - small one in a sort of like a small
66:11 - cloud
66:11 - small bubble on top of the cart saying
66:14 - that we have one
66:15 - item inside of our cart that's right
66:18 - okay
66:19 - so in order to play something
66:23 - on top of something you got to work with
66:26 - positioning
66:27 - yeah in css and it's actually very
66:29 - interesting it's actually very
66:30 - interesting because
66:32 - if you want to think about it here's
66:33 - kind of how it is right remember
66:35 - everything
66:35 - inside html is like once with each other
66:38 - right so if i look at it right now right
66:40 - i'm going to show it to you guys right
66:42 - if i look at it right now if i want to
66:43 - take this specific you know oh
66:45 - shoot if i want to take this iphone
66:47 - let's just say right and i want to put
66:49 - it next to each other right i can only
66:50 - put it next to it i don't i can't
66:51 - just put on top or you know on the
66:53 - bottom you know inside
66:54 - html it's just impossible i have to like
66:57 - put it put it next to each other above
66:58 - below above below in the bottom
67:01 - but in order to actually put it on the
67:03 - top so that it's kind of like
67:04 - this right right it's kind of like this
67:07 - you see right here
67:08 - instead of set to the side we need to
67:10 - use absolute positioning
67:12 - so what can happen to this your canvas
67:14 - right here becomes your position
67:16 - relative
67:17 - it is what you're going to be
67:19 - positioning to
67:20 - so in our case what's our position
67:22 - relative right what's our what are we
67:24 - relating to it's going to be what well
67:26 - it's going to be towards that
67:28 - orange little box which is which one
67:30 - which is
67:31 - right here it's this little orange box
67:33 - that's your position relative that's
67:34 - your space that you're going to be
67:35 - positioning to
67:36 - right now what's going to happen
67:39 - is we're going to take that box this is
67:41 - our box right here right
67:43 - you guys see it yes or no you guys see
67:44 - it all right yeah
67:46 - and then we're gonna make this right
67:48 - here this iphone
67:50 - a position absolute when you make this
67:52 - absolute you can pretty much place it
67:54 - anywhere you want that's the crazy part
67:56 - right so if i say position absolute that
67:58 - means i can place it on top now
68:00 - or even on the bottom if i wanted to
68:02 - right if i say push absolute and i say
68:04 - hey you know push absolute
68:06 - from top zero pixels right and
68:09 - right here i think not sure this is from
68:11 - the left or the right hand side from the
68:12 - right
68:13 - zero pixels i'm going to place it in the
68:15 - right corner
68:17 - right i think you're seeing it from the
68:19 - right or from the left i'm not sure
68:20 - but if it's i'm saying here from the top
68:22 - i want zero pixels
68:24 - and from the left or from the right i
68:25 - want zero pixels as well
68:27 - okay and so what's gonna happen i'm
68:29 - gonna paste it in that
68:30 - little little corner right there and
68:32 - honestly that's it guys
68:34 - right so what we're gonna do is we're
68:37 - gonna do the same
68:38 - thing the same thing with
68:41 - uh the same thing with that div let's
68:43 - take a look at it
68:44 - so jesse let's see how does that work
68:46 - out
68:49 - so you want to on like you said the
68:53 - parent div
68:53 - is that orange box so let's find that
68:56 - orange box
68:57 - it's here on line 41.
69:00 - that one so let's give that a
69:04 - yeah let's give that a relative
69:06 - positioning
69:07 - okay and until when css all you got to
69:09 - do is say
69:11 - relative well like that
69:15 - okay then um
69:18 - [Music]
69:19 - we need to of course make that number
69:23 - well to make that dumber we're going to
69:25 - create another div class
69:26 - so we're going to say diff class
69:30 - okay and let's say card number
69:34 - because those are the numbers of cards
69:36 - no actually
69:37 - card item because those are the number
69:40 - of items
69:41 - we have okay and this one
69:44 - because the parent is relative we want
69:47 - the child
69:48 - to have an absolute positioning okay
69:51 - but you gotta tell what this absolute
69:54 - positioning will be
69:56 - right guess what in relationship to the
69:59 - parent
70:00 - all right so we're going to give it we
70:02 - want it in the top
70:04 - and we want it at the right okay
70:07 - so what you do what you do is
70:10 - you're going to mention something with
70:13 - top
70:14 - and then also something with right okay
70:17 - but how much that is that is something
70:19 - you got to figure out sometimes
70:20 - it's a little bit like trial and error
70:23 - okay so you could do
70:27 - um positive i mean i believe with
70:30 - positioning absolute you can either use
70:32 - positive notion but sometimes
70:34 - you're also using a negative one right
70:37 - now
70:38 - well let's let's show them how the
70:39 - positive let's just let's just say top
70:41 - zero and right zero let's just see what
70:43 - that will look like
70:44 - right right that's for yeah right that's
70:46 - yeah that's a good idea so let's first
70:48 - show
70:48 - what happens when you do top zero
70:52 - right zero okay
70:55 - so i've done that but now we're not
70:58 - seeing anything because i need to
71:00 - give it some height and width okay
71:02 - that's right so i'm going to give it
71:03 - height the width
71:04 - of four i'm going to give it a
71:06 - background of white
71:08 - and rounded but rounded like full
71:12 - because we want
71:14 - it to make like a circle and of course
71:17 - what is inside of it is we're gonna you
71:20 - want to center that
71:21 - so we're gonna give it the flex justify
71:24 - center and
71:26 - item center plus of course
71:30 - there needs to be something inside of
71:33 - that so here we're going to say
71:34 - one okay and so now if we save that
71:38 - boom right there look see now we have a
71:41 - circle in the right corner because why
71:43 - we said hey you know what
71:45 - we need to go ahead and make sure that a
71:47 - one it's
71:48 - uh what height of four width of four but
71:51 - the cool thing is that we're saying hey
71:53 - from top zero and from the right zero so
71:55 - from the top
71:56 - there's zero pixels you see now it's on
71:57 - the top and i will be set it's smack on
71:59 - the top
72:00 - and from the right it's zero pixels as
72:02 - well so it's pushing to the right hand
72:04 - side
72:04 - right so always remember top right
72:08 - if you want to make something on the
72:09 - left corner what would you use guys what
72:11 - would you use if i don't put it on the
72:12 - left corner what would you use tell me
72:13 - let me put in the chat
72:14 - i'm very curious what would you use if
72:16 - you want to put it in the left corner
72:18 - that's right top zero zero zero
72:21 - that's right correct exactly but what
72:24 - you can also see guys
72:26 - is that even though we have a value of
72:28 - zero
72:29 - here it is not going outside of the
72:33 - parent
72:34 - mm-hmm it's not going outside of the
72:37 - parent
72:38 - it's not overlapping the parent so
72:41 - that's when
72:43 - the negative values come into place okay
72:47 - so by the way to make the to make the
72:50 - one visible let's give it a color also
72:53 - by the way so i'm going to say text
72:57 - gray 800 okay
73:00 - and i'm also going to make the text very
73:01 - small so text
73:03 - hyphen xs okay
73:06 - and right guys let's go into it now okay
73:10 - we got the absolute positioning here
73:12 - looking good excuse me
73:16 - looking good so far awesome
73:19 - we got the top zero position here and
73:21 - the right zero but as you can see it
73:23 - still stays within
73:25 - that orange box so let's move it a
73:27 - little bit up we're going to give it
73:29 - a minus a negative value and how do you
73:32 - do that in cs
73:33 - until wind you're going to say minus top
73:36 - okay minus top hyphen
73:40 - zero a one okay to move it a little bit
73:44 - to the top so this is like a negative
73:46 - pool it's being pulled towards
73:48 - the browser i mean the top the website
73:51 - okay and minus right
73:55 - well minus and then hyphen
73:59 - one yeah boom so right there so if i
74:02 - save this
74:02 - oh look at that so what's going on when
74:05 - you give it a negative value basically
74:07 - for example if i if i go back to my
74:09 - right my ipad which is like right here
74:12 - if i given a negative value if i have in
74:13 - the corner right here guys you guys can
74:15 - see it
74:15 - it's like hey yeah not top zero but top
74:18 - minus
74:19 - two pixels minus one it's actually
74:21 - bringing up
74:22 - up it's like going the opposite way
74:24 - that's the weird part about it
74:26 - same thing if you say right minus two or
74:29 - minus one
74:30 - let's just say right is you push it from
74:32 - outside right because if you say hey
74:34 - top two pixels it's gonna push it to the
74:36 - bottom
74:37 - from the top that's what's gonna happen
74:38 - right from the bottom to the top
74:40 - but if you say minus two it's like
74:42 - you're going the opposite way
74:44 - so that's the weird part you have to
74:46 - understand right right that's like yeah
74:47 - that's right it's like a mirror that's
74:49 - right
74:49 - right so it's really really cool the way
74:51 - it kind of works but it's really helpful
74:52 - and very useful
74:54 - because that allows us to create things
74:55 - like these right
74:57 - and honestly at that point that's it
74:58 - we've created a little card icon
75:00 - it looks so good and so clean guys the
75:02 - design you build here
75:04 - is looking beautiful right we have our
75:07 - card page
75:08 - right we have our so if we go to cart
75:10 - page to go the cart page oh
75:12 - here's what one less we can do is we can
75:14 - actually give it a link so
75:15 - one last thing we can do is if i go and
75:17 - expand my code here
75:19 - right our whole cart icon is right here
75:23 - see right right there so if i'm gonna go
75:25 - with it like this
75:26 - the two cart
75:30 - icon i'm actually going to give it a
75:32 - link
75:33 - right here right so i'm gonna say a
75:36 - shreef is equal to what
75:41 - card.html i'm going to close it up and
75:43 - i'll copy this
75:44 - closing link tag and i'm going to put it
75:47 - around the whole
75:47 - card icon like this you see
75:58 - just like that right there and honestly
75:59 - that's pretty much it so now
76:01 - if i save this i go back to here i can
76:04 - click on this specific car
76:05 - link click on it it takes you the card
76:08 - html
76:09 - and that's it then we can go back to

78:28 - then click continue from there all right
78:31 - select the account you can say default
78:33 - account for firebase that's fine
78:35 - and all you would do at this point is
78:37 - just create project
78:39 - wait for it to wait for it to load wait
78:41 - for it to load let's leave for it to
78:43 - road

78:52 - up
79:00 - there we go nice nice nice good
79:04 - good good good beautiful that's all good
79:06 - now that's done
79:08 - click continue all right and now we're
79:10 - inside our project
79:11 - okay and then one last thing i want you
79:13 - guys to do is go to your firestore
79:15 - database right here so you see it says
79:16 - firestar database
79:18 - actually no don't do it right now go to
79:20 - settings right here settings
79:23 - all right go to there guys okay or maybe
79:26 - you save this maybe you
79:27 - make sure when you're watched make sure
79:28 - you do this go to settings project
79:30 - settings
79:31 - okay and then what you want to do is go
79:35 - to your click
79:38 - click scroll down from there so you're
79:40 - on here now scroll down
79:42 - and this is your app so this is what
79:43 - you're going to do to actually configure
79:45 - your application and
79:46 - actually put it in to your application
79:48 - so
79:50 - configure your app right here all right
79:52 - click on it
79:53 - click on this app so click on this web
79:55 - portion not this
79:56 - not this but this one right here all
79:59 - right
80:00 - click on it also give it a nickname so
80:03 - amazon
80:05 - clone 2 all right
80:08 - register app
80:14 - and that's it at this point that my
80:17 - friends
80:18 - is it okay you don't need anything else
80:20 - so
80:21 - then what you do later on is i want you
80:23 - to kind of copy this
80:24 - so copy this right here make sure it's
80:27 - copied
80:27 - and then you will later on save that in
80:30 - your script
80:31 - right so what i want you to do is let's
80:34 - go back to our
80:35 - project let's do
80:38 - new file that's called firebase.js
80:43 - all right firebase.js make sure that's
80:46 - there
80:47 - is a javascript file you're going to
80:49 - copy this
80:50 - var configuration together with
80:52 - everything here so i'm going i'm not
80:54 - going to copy this script instead of
80:55 - going to copy just this firebase config
80:57 - all right if you're trying to mess with
80:59 - my fibers config don't worry i'm going
81:00 - to change this right after because i've
81:02 - had people who will
81:03 - mess with this and i have gone and did
81:06 - some weird stuff
81:07 - okay so don't mess with my config i'm
81:10 - going to change it
81:12 - okay that's like a warning so right
81:15 - there
81:15 - copy the fibers config
81:19 - right okay paste it inside here
81:24 - this is what you got
81:28 - and save that right and then what you
81:32 - want to do
81:33 - is okay then what you want to do
81:37 - is copy these script tags see the script
81:40 - tags
81:41 - copy them these script tags right here
81:44 - copy command c go to your index.html
81:47 - and then paste them underneath your
81:51 - js you know the gd icon and then right
81:55 - right before the head tag is ending
81:58 - so let's remove this copy paste the
81:59 - scripts i don't need this
82:02 - right there right
82:05 - make sure that's done so now we have the
82:07 - firebase app configuration
82:09 - and then now we have the firebase
82:10 - analytics as well which i'm not really
82:12 - necessary but we're just gonna have it
82:14 - there it's fine
82:16 - save that and my friends that's pretty
82:19 - much it
82:20 - next time tomorrow we're actually going
82:22 - to include a database create our own
82:24 - database
82:25 - and then include a database and actually
82:27 - get items from a database
82:28 - so if you want to have a head start on
82:30 - the database here's my recommendation
82:33 - okay let's go ahead and continue to
82:35 - console
82:37 - right this is your configuration if you
82:39 - want to have a head start
82:40 - go to firestore database right here
82:44 - okay click on gray database
82:48 - put into start test in test mode do that
82:52 - click on next okay
82:56 - click on enable alright that's it click
82:59 - enable
83:02 - alright good good good good good good
83:04 - good let it load let it load
83:06 - again this is so you guys have a head
83:08 - start for tomorrow so you're all good
83:09 - okay because tomorrow we're gonna be
83:10 - using a lot of this stuff
83:11 - firebase javascript and actually
83:13 - implementing putting this
83:15 - all together because the last day of the
83:17 - project and we're going to be finishing
83:19 - this up
83:20 - provisioning the cloud firestore right
83:22 - now give it one second
83:24 - one second one second one second one
83:26 - second one second one second one second
83:28 - but yeah the reason we're using
83:30 - firestore guys by the way just to let
83:31 - you guys know
83:32 - is because it will allow will allow you
83:34 - number one to connect to database really
83:35 - fast
83:36 - uh david it's gonna be test mode okay
83:39 - test mode david
83:41 - right it's gonna be really fast and it's
83:43 - going to allow you to
83:44 - live reload so basically as soon as i
83:47 - add to card
83:48 - you know as soon as i add the card it's
83:50 - gonna be really simple
83:52 - add to cart and then right away i'll
83:54 - actually see the changes
83:55 - that's so fast that's the that's the
83:57 - really cool part about uh firebase
83:59 - right so it has created our application
84:02 - right here
84:03 - that's all good all we do now at this
84:05 - point is click on start collection
84:08 - and that's called items right this is
84:10 - going to be your actual products right
84:12 - right it's going it's a database now you
84:14 - have a database for items
84:17 - okay click on items and click next
84:22 - this is gonna be your first document id
84:24 - so click auto id for this one you don't
84:25 - need this this is
84:26 - a unique id for individual product our
84:29 - first
84:30 - field is going to be image right that's
84:32 - the data we're going to save
84:33 - that's going to the link to the image so
84:35 - let's go back to our amazon 2.0
84:37 - where is it let's copy the link to our
84:39 - image let's say it's a macbook pro copy
84:41 - image address
84:43 - right and then paste it in here
84:46 - beautiful now it's in there
84:47 - click plus and the second name is going
84:49 - to be second feels gonna be name
84:51 - also right apple macbook pro
84:54 - 13-inch copy that go back
84:58 - boom paste it okay see and they're all
85:01 - strings
85:02 - last one next one is going to be what
85:04 - the make
85:06 - so it's going to be make and that's
85:08 - going to be apple
85:10 - right okay good then click another add
85:12 - field
85:13 - and all you do at this point is what the
85:16 - rating see says 4.8
85:18 - so let's do rating instead of being a
85:21 - string we're going to give it a number
85:23 - so i'm going to say 4.8 number okay
85:27 - and the last was going to be price right
85:29 - here also not a string but also just a
85:31 - number
85:32 - put it in there go to here and then say
85:35 - 1149 so
85:38 - 1 1 four nine and you cannot add any
85:40 - commas because
85:41 - it's a number not a string guys click
85:44 - save
85:45 - and there you go now you have your
85:48 - items collection it's an items database
85:51 - and your first document is in there
85:53 - so my condition for you for homework is
85:55 - go ahead
85:57 - and add as many documents as you
85:58 - possibly can inside here
86:00 - whatever documents you want to sell
86:02 - maybe you have your own documents add
86:04 - them
86:04 - all inside here understand
86:07 - do you understand me yes or no
86:11 - yes you know seven yes or no good yes
86:13 - good
86:14 - so that's gonna be your homework so now
86:16 - at this point guys
86:18 - now we are fully
86:22 - done this is going to be this is your
86:25 - day
86:26 - three oh the javascript challenge

87:04 - right somebody said what was after price
87:08 - after price there was nothing maria it
87:10 - was just only price was the last one
87:12 - image make

87:19 - um price and then the rating make sure
87:22 - there's a rating is in there too
