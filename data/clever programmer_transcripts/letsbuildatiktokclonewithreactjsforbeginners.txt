01:02 - you see so in case you've never used
01:04 - like third-party libraries

04:23 - out with us you're gonna be just fine i
04:25 - wouldn't worry about that
04:27 - now sunny before we start getting into
04:29 - the build let's just cover again
04:30 - all the tech so here uh we started
04:33 - talking about it so let me just go here
04:35 - and write it out so you guys know what's
04:37 - coming up
04:37 - so we got material ui that's going to be
04:40 - a part of it
04:41 - then and we're going to say tick tock
04:45 - clone tech stack okay yeah
04:48 - uh next up is what did you say it was
04:50 - like firebase right
04:52 - and this is going to be used yep are we
04:54 - using a database at all
04:56 - we're just hosting today okay using a
04:58 - database yep
05:00 - got it what else are we going to be
05:01 - using flexbox what third-party things
05:03 - you mentioned earlier something
05:05 - third-party so like let's just list
05:06 - every single thing out that they will
05:08 - need to know so
05:10 - a bunch of css hacks today so literally
05:12 - just label it as css hacks
05:14 - uh and then in brackets we can write
05:16 - flexbox so we're going to be covering a
05:17 - bunch of flexbox
05:19 - and there's the css hacks which is even
05:21 - new to me guys is this snapping
05:22 - functionality so you know
05:23 - you saw when we were scrolling it kind
05:25 - of snapped into place and stuff like
05:27 - that right
05:27 - that's going to be something which we're
05:29 - going to teach you today how to do
05:30 - because that was actually a new thing
05:31 - for me even i've never actually had a
05:33 - use case where i had to do it vertically
05:35 - i've used it for a carousel but this was
05:36 - a new sort of thing for me so
05:38 - that was a really cool thing to go over
05:41 - anything let's have a look what else
05:42 - we've got
05:43 - we have got a bunch of third-party stuff
05:45 - so we've talked about material ui
05:47 - um we also did use something else what
05:49 - was it um
05:53 - main thing here guys is we are actually
05:55 - going to be oh yeah we're using the use
05:57 - ref hook
05:58 - for once so use ref so we talk about use
06:00 - state we talk about use effect
06:02 - but today we're going to show you guys
06:04 - how to use the use ref hook
06:07 - yeah which is a completely different
06:08 - hook and there's a there's a few odd
06:10 - cases where you run into this and you're
06:11 - going to need to use this in
06:13 - some situations and we're going to show
06:14 - you how to do that here yeah
06:17 - okay beautiful and if i could have i'm
06:20 - gonna what i'm gonna do
06:21 - is let's see if i can pop out of the
06:23 - whiteboard mode
06:25 - real quick let's pop out of the
06:26 - whiteboard mode and
06:28 - um if we start taking a look at this you
06:31 - know the material ui
06:32 - is going to be used for what thanks
06:34 - sonny material ui is going to be used i
06:36 - imagine
06:36 - definitely for these icons that i see
06:38 - over here on the right hand side
06:40 - yeah so it's going to be used for the
06:41 - icons even the one that you see on the
06:44 - bottom left
06:45 - so the um the the song icon even for
06:48 - that one we actually have a material ui
06:49 - icon
06:50 - right here so yep that's material ui
06:53 - icons
06:53 - and now what is uh firebase hosting used
06:56 - for we got another super chat
06:58 - thank you uh unchill really appreciate
07:01 - it
07:02 - appreciate that we are actually getting
07:04 - somebody for c plus plus uh
07:06 - and uh michael so he's actually going to
07:08 - start doing
07:09 - c plus stuff so okay so we got material
07:12 - ui icons now firebase hosting is going
07:14 - to be used to host this app online on a
07:17 - certain url
07:18 - right yep okay great and then what about
07:21 - the database what what is that going to
07:23 - be used for
07:24 - yeah so we're going to be using the
07:26 - firestore database and the reason why
07:27 - we're going to use this one guys is
07:29 - because it's real time
07:30 - which means that let's say for example
07:31 - you're on the website and somebody adds
07:34 - a new video to tick-tock or your
07:37 - feed it's going to pop in in real time
07:39 - and then show you that on your feed
07:41 - because remember that's a really
07:42 - important part of tiktok you want it to
07:43 - be real time you want to be
07:45 - uh really quick and really fast so we
07:47 - host all of our data on firestore
07:49 - which is firebase's database yep
07:52 - okay got it and then what types of
07:54 - things so one we're using so right now
07:56 - we're going to be using it for hosting
07:58 - videos
07:59 - yep no so we're not actually hosting the
08:01 - videos these videos are actually on tick
08:03 - tock
08:04 - what we're doing is we're storing the
08:05 - url yeah including the url to that video
08:08 - on firestore
08:09 - got it makes sense so all these videos
08:11 - that are being shown here are actually
08:13 - being pulled from
08:14 - the database yes exactly so it's
08:17 - different
08:18 - everything was pulled from a database
08:20 - yeah okay got it so that's important you
08:22 - guys it's not hard-coded
08:23 - like that's important for you guys to
08:24 - know these videos are actually being
08:26 - pulled from a database so it's already
08:28 - a really dynamic app okay yeah and then
08:31 - um we talked a little bit about like css
08:34 - hacks
08:35 - now let's just talk about where are we
08:37 - looking to use them so
08:38 - flexbox first of all where is flexbox
08:41 - being
08:41 - box being used what are we doing on this
08:43 - app with flexbox
08:45 - so notice how we have where it says for
08:47 - example champagne mommy and then it has
08:49 - the description and then it has the song
08:51 - playing
08:52 - all of that stuff right we're using
08:54 - flexbox to correctly layer
08:56 - layout and position things even if you
08:58 - notice like the the
08:59 - icons on the right hand side and the way
09:01 - it's like a it's a sort of vertical
09:03 - stack
09:03 - we're using flexbox there so like
09:06 - there's a bunch of different
09:07 - uh use cases here where we're trying to
09:09 - uh get like an easy
09:10 - responsive design and we're doing that
09:12 - with flexbox as for the css hack
09:14 - the csx a really interesting one guys
09:17 - it's called scroll snap
09:19 - so scroll snap and that's gonna be what
09:21 - pretty much how we achieve that
09:23 - functionality is as to when you scroll
09:25 - how does it
09:26 - snap into place like every time and and
09:28 - that's going to that's actually
09:29 - something which
09:30 - is quite a tricky problem to solve but
09:32 - we've actually simplified it quite a lot
09:33 - today
09:34 - so if i go so if just so we can talk
09:36 - about it like you guys see how it snaps
09:38 - when i scroll through
09:39 - like scroll scroll scroll scroll scroll
09:41 - scroll scroll
09:42 - and then at some point you guys are
09:43 - gonna notice that it just like
09:45 - snaps you know this is why kind of
09:47 - automatically as i scroll through
09:49 - the videos will like snap to the top and
09:52 - that is
09:52 - one of the things that he's talking
09:53 - about yeah exactly
09:57 - okay said they are not sharing github we
10:00 - will be sharing a github
10:01 - at the end of this uh we'll be pushing
10:03 - the code to a github repo yeah yeah
10:05 - thank you vishnu for a snooper chat and
10:07 - then work digital
10:08 - really appreciate it and yes we're gonna
10:10 - upload this video and it's gonna be on
10:11 - our youtube guys so don't worry about
10:13 - that
10:14 - yeah exactly yep okay and then um
10:18 - where's the music being pulled from is
10:19 - it a local file
10:22 - from it's part of the video file so got
10:24 - it video part that we actually use has
10:26 - the music inside of it yeah okay got it
10:29 - and so snap functionality is definitely
10:30 - one of them and then when you
10:32 - say third party like things like use ref
10:34 - hooks what are we using use ref hooks
10:36 - for yeah so they use ref hook is
10:39 - basically whenever we have that video
10:41 - right
10:42 - we we need to somehow capture it so that
10:44 - when that when you click
10:46 - the video we can actually do something
10:48 - so in this case when we click the video
10:49 - it plays the video and when we when we
10:51 - stop the video we
10:52 - when we click it again it pauses it
10:53 - right so we use a combination of
10:56 - state so we use use state and we use use
10:58 - ref and what we're using use ref for in
11:00 - this case
11:01 - is to specifically say this video
11:04 - is the one i'm clicking on right so it's
11:06 - like basically attaching a reference
11:08 - to that video and then so when i boot so
11:10 - when i click on it and it plays
11:12 - [Music]
11:14 - hold on it's blowing up people's ears
11:16 - i'm really sorry guys
11:18 - um so let's play maybe this one as well
11:22 - here
11:22 - and i'm gonna just hit it
11:29 - so that's usrev yep so that's used rep
11:33 - and what we're doing there guys is we're
11:34 - actually like sort of capturing a
11:36 - reference
11:37 - to that video that's on the screen so
11:40 - that video element
11:41 - so just how like in simple html what you
11:43 - usually do is get document by id or
11:45 - something like that and then you get the
11:46 - element right
11:47 - in react we use references to actually
11:50 - target
11:50 - individual elements when we've got
11:52 - specific use cases like this
11:54 - um so it's really powerful actually it's
11:56 - really nice way of doing it
11:57 - uh but when we reach that point it will
11:59 - be a really cool thing to run through so
12:01 - stay tuned for that guys yep and one
12:04 - thing i did want to let you guys know
12:06 - guys if you're enjoying this so far
12:08 - here's the thing that doesn't cost you
12:09 - anything but changes our lives
12:11 - and keeps us going guys please go ahead
12:13 - and smash that like button
12:16 - really really helps the channel grow and
12:18 - this video to go out if you're finding
12:20 - value there's a high chance
12:22 - one other person is going to be finding
12:24 - value and if you just hit that like
12:25 - button it goes
12:26 - it makes sure to go out to that one
12:28 - person so we would really appreciate
12:30 - that
12:31 - and thing number two that i wanted to
12:33 - let you guys know
12:34 - is that tomorrow i don't know if you
12:37 - even knew this sunny
12:38 - but tomorrow we are actually gonna be
12:41 - doing
12:41 - car tracking with python i saw dude i
12:45 - saw it pop up that's so cool like
12:47 - literally yeah i mean is it using some
12:48 - kind of machine learning or what
12:50 - yep exactly it's going to be using
12:52 - machine learning so uh an
12:53 - ai and basically we're going to show you
12:56 - guys with just a few lines of code
12:58 - how you can track cars that are going by
13:01 - so
13:01 - pedestrian traffic and that's going to
13:03 - be like one huge thing we're going to
13:05 - show you guys how to do that with python
13:06 - tomorrow
13:07 - that's insane even i want to watch that
13:10 - i'll be dope nice nice

13:29 - how we use ai
13:30 - to go ahead and track cars and and
13:32 - figure out which what is the car and
13:33 - what isn't so
13:34 - super impressive things coming tomorrow
13:37 - yeah
13:38 - pump for it all right so let's just get
13:41 - d uh into the build now sunny i think
13:43 - we've overall like road mapped it really
13:45 - well
13:46 - what uh uh what tech we're going to be
13:48 - using
13:49 - the overall tech stack things like that
13:51 - i think at this point
13:52 - we can kind of just get into the build
13:56 - let's do it dude so the first step guys
13:58 - is we're going to go ahead and use
14:00 - a a tool called create react app so
14:03 - every single time we do these builds we
14:05 - use it
14:05 - it's something built by facebook and
14:07 - yeah we do create react
14:09 - app and we're going to say tick tock
14:12 - clone there we go
14:16 - i'm going to go ahead and request read
14:18 - write access
14:20 - there we go great and have i got access
14:24 - to your 3000
14:25 - as well let's go ahead and give me
14:27 - access to 3
14:29 - dope will do that so i will
14:35 - i mean i'm not i'm not running anything
14:37 - right now yeah
14:38 - well while that's installing and setting
14:40 - everything up for us
14:41 - what we're going to go ahead and do is
14:42 - go ahead and set up firebase so
14:45 - all you need to set up a firebase
14:46 - account is a google account
14:48 - so you just need a google account so
14:49 - it's super easy and simple to set up
14:51 - um let's go ahead and head over to
14:53 - firebase
14:54 - yeah yeah so once once you're at
14:58 - firebase guys
14:58 - firebase is just a set of tools so it's
15:01 - imagine like aws
15:02 - right so it's like aws which is amazon
15:05 - web services
15:06 - it's essentially the same thing but the
15:08 - user friendly version right so it's a
15:10 - really really nice way of doing it
15:12 - it's very very like user friendly to get
15:14 - started with firebase and it's so
15:16 - powerful guys
15:16 - so once you're on this page you just
15:19 - need to hit the top right
15:20 - where it says um go to console or in the
15:23 - in the burger menu
15:25 - and then once you're logged in you're
15:27 - gonna click the add project button
15:29 - yep i'm just logging into the right
15:31 - account and then i'm gonna hit
15:33 - the button that you're talking about so
15:35 - i'm gonna click add project here
15:37 - so and then this project is going to be
15:40 - tick-tock clone right
15:41 - that's right yeah
15:45 - cool there we go awesome people are like

16:26 - completely free so not only is the
16:28 - tutorial free but we also have
16:30 - like uh firebase which is completely
16:31 - free for the quote uh for very generous
16:34 - quota so
16:35 - it's going to be something which is
16:36 - definitely worth going ahead and doing
16:37 - so all you need is a google account and
16:39 - you can pretty much go ahead and use
16:40 - firebase and we remember you travel with
16:42 - zane thanks for coming through
16:43 - really appreciate you i remember you
16:45 - said you were booked for today i
16:46 - remember rifki's here i see
16:49 - sneha and also steve is here so yeah we
16:52 - remember all you guys that were here
16:53 - yesterday
16:55 - i remember him awesome we got
16:58 - a lueno awesome nice he's back
17:01 - yeah nice awesome so guys
17:05 - uh i think it okay still installing on
17:07 - the bottom left
17:08 - okay nice so what we need to do then is
17:10 - go ahead and configure it so we're going
17:12 - to go ahead and register the app so here
17:14 - we write tick tock clone
17:16 - and we make we need to make sure we tick
17:18 - the also set up firebase hosting
17:21 - tick nice oh yeah
17:24 - let's also talk the next button here
17:29 - and i'm going to just continue to the
17:31 - console and uh one thing that we want to
17:33 - do is what
17:34 - pull the config file yeah exactly we
17:37 - need the config file so we need to go to
17:38 - the burger menu
17:39 - click the uh that little cog and then go
17:41 - down to config and basically you want to
17:43 - copy this
17:44 - and then inside the uh folder so i think
17:47 - it's okay so
17:48 - i'm just gonna make like a firebase.js
17:52 - yep and i'm just gonna paste it in there
17:54 - for now and hit save so you guys can do
17:56 - the same thing just copy your config
17:59 - let's get rid of all of this copy your
18:02 - config
18:03 - and then just drop it into your
18:06 - firebase.js like that
18:08 - exactly and we're going to use that
18:10 - later on guys
18:11 - for the next steps so um nice
18:14 - um also venkat asks are you creating an
18:17 - app using redux in the future
18:19 - we can definitely create an app using
18:20 - redux in the future guys if a lot of you
18:22 - guys want that
18:23 - we're happy to go ahead and build that
18:25 - soon so uh we can definitely do that
18:27 - maybe with the spotify
18:28 - clone we could use redux so yeah awesome
18:30 - yeah
18:31 - nice dope so now what we're gonna do
18:34 - is um we're just waiting on the uh the
18:38 - create react app setting up still so i
18:40 - mean should we answer questions in the
18:42 - meantime
18:42 - we'll have a look yeah we can take out
18:45 - we can
18:46 - people are pumped to be here we're
18:47 - waiting on the react app to finish
18:49 - installing you guys so after that we're
18:51 - going to move on to the next step
18:53 - so till then um ariane
18:56 - aurora says congrats sonny on 3k
18:58 - followers thank you we're almost at 4k
19:01 - we crossed the halfway mark so oh yeah
19:02 - here 3 500
19:04 - on yeah i think 3600 now yeah
19:08 - yeah guys we're to build some stuff with
19:10 - redux as well i think that would be fun
19:12 - i still want to go uh there are a lot of
19:14 - bills that we just want to do for fun
19:16 - and for business purposes anyway and
19:19 - we're thinking to do some of them
19:20 - together with you guys like the youtube
19:22 - thumbnail one
19:24 - yeah is one and then um i think some
19:27 - projects that are gonna require
19:28 - redux um is the spotify clone gonna
19:31 - require that sonny
19:32 - or no um i mean we i think for spotify
19:36 - we could build it with it but it might
19:37 - be overkill
19:38 - um for what we need to do um
19:41 - something we could definitely look at i
19:43 - think when we come to building it i
19:44 - think there may be better apps to use
19:46 - you know
19:47 - for for we could do some machine
19:49 - learning stuff too
19:50 - with firebase and everything right
19:52 - because google has cloud vision
19:55 - yeah that would be dope that would be
19:56 - actually really cool maybe have it so
19:58 - that we did that same project that you
19:59 - and aaron did
20:00 - but we do have firebase oh that would be
20:02 - awesome
20:03 - yeah yeah because i love python but
20:07 - i couldn't even get aaron's vision
20:09 - project
20:10 - six lines of code to work on my machine
20:12 - aaron i spent like one hour and we were
20:14 - late to the stream
20:15 - and then we ended up just sharing his
20:17 - screen whereas what i love about
20:19 - um javascript is all the stuff is pretty
20:22 - much
20:23 - going to run the same way everywhere
20:25 - yeah exactly awesome
20:28 - nice we have um oh it's installed yep
20:31 - spill
20:32 - nice so once you get this happy hacking
20:34 - message what you want to do is
20:35 - do a cd and go inside that folder so cd
20:39 - tick tock clone
20:40 - okay enter and then once you're at this
20:42 - point do a ls
20:43 - ls just lists out the files and make
20:45 - sure that you're in the correct
20:46 - directory right
20:47 - now once you have that what we're going
20:49 - to do is we actually
20:50 - okay so we already went ahead and added
20:52 - the firebase.js let's
20:54 - go ahead and cause let's move that
20:55 - firebase.js into our source
20:58 - yo for some reason i can't follow you
21:02 - really yeah like i'm you i'm clicking
21:04 - your orange button and nothing happens
21:06 - and then i'm back in
21:09 - right and then i like click
21:13 - follow participant you know what i mean
21:16 - see what's happening yeah
21:17 - i think now now it's following you i
21:19 - don't know why i was doing that now yeah
21:21 - now it works
21:22 - awesome all right so now the thing is
21:26 - built
21:26 - should we go ahead and remove the
21:30 - before we do that we just want to do mpm
21:32 - start
21:33 - so npm start inside the terminal and if
21:35 - everything's gone well guys
21:37 - we'll see a like little react app start
21:40 - up
21:40 - on localhost 3000 and that will have a
21:43 - little spinning
21:44 - cog on it right yeah so that's what
21:46 - you're going to need to do
21:47 - and then if you get to that point
21:48 - firstly well done like that's really
21:50 - that's a good point to get to because
21:51 - you know everything's working and
21:52 - everything's like good
21:54 - okay and then what you want to do is
21:56 - once you get that screen where it's got
21:57 - a spinning wheel on it
21:59 - then we essentially want to have it so
22:01 - that
22:02 - we need to clean it up we want like a
22:04 - blank canvas to start from right
22:06 - so we don't we want we don't want all of
22:08 - those um
22:09 - hey here it is nice so
22:13 - oh somebody just said in the chat we
22:15 - should make chess we should make
22:17 - actually
22:17 - i would love to do that because i love
22:20 - chess
22:21 - so we should we should do something with
22:22 - that
22:24 - yeah that would be dope actually yeah i
22:26 - mean i've never done a game
22:28 - uh i don't think i've never done a game
22:29 - in react so that'll be a really cool one
22:31 - to do
22:32 - yeah yeah we could use react we could
22:34 - use redux for that maybe
22:36 - oh yeah yeah that would be fun so now
22:39 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to go
22:40 - ahead and delete the test stuff so guys
22:43 - logo test.js and setup test.js just to
22:46 - clean everything up we just go ahead and
22:48 - delete them
22:50 - and now everything is going to crash
22:51 - because it's going to complain we don't
22:53 - have the logo
22:54 - so if you guys have been following us so
22:56 - far you'll know that we
22:58 - go to this file app.js and remove that
23:02 - line
23:02 - and also everything between
23:06 - the uh div of app
23:09 - we're gonna go ahead and also remove
23:12 - that
23:13 - and then we're just gonna put h1 here
23:15 - and it's gonna say
23:16 - hello clever programmers
23:19 - let's build the tick tock clone
23:23 - and i'm just going to put a rocket emoji
23:25 - the exclamation mark hit save
23:28 - and what is the problem that we're
23:30 - getting oh yeah okay the h1
23:32 - i don't know it always does this weird
23:34 - thing to me yeah
23:35 - it's annoying though so now i'm going to
23:36 - hit save and boom here we go
23:39 - everything is there and now because
23:41 - everything is centered
23:42 - i'm going to actually go ahead and talk
23:44 - about this sunny
23:46 - nice i love this dude yeah so we're
23:50 - gonna follow a bem convention
23:53 - and uh i feel like i'm just
23:55 - regurgitating
23:57 - i feel like a proud dad yeah yeah yeah
24:01 - so now we're gonna follow a bem
24:03 - convention you guys and we're going to
24:04 - make sure that
24:07 - this is a lowercase app and then
24:10 - what are we going to do sunny we're
24:12 - going to create an app.css now
24:14 - so the app.css is created by default
24:16 - buttons to go inside there remove
24:18 - everything
24:19 - yeah remove everything all right guys so
24:21 - i'm just gonna visually to show you guys
24:23 - i'm gonna make a big
24:24 - x on this thing just so you know we're
24:26 - gonna chop
24:27 - everything in uh inside of our app.css
24:31 - so go ahead
24:32 - and do that and then what's going to
24:33 - happen is this is going to stop
24:35 - being centered that's your one cue that
24:37 - you should get
24:38 - because right now it's being centered so
24:41 - once i remove it
24:42 - and hit save now it's not centered
24:44 - anymore and even when i go full screen
24:46 - it's not centered
24:47 - okay exactly now guys notice how there's
24:50 - a slight gap above
24:51 - hello clever programmers so what we need
24:53 - oh yeah whenever we start an app we need
24:55 - to go to index.css
24:58 - and let's add the following rule so we
25:00 - could do it in here but i prefer to do
25:01 - it in index
25:03 - uh dot css just because let's go to
25:06 - index.css
25:07 - boom yeah and now here what you want to
25:10 - do is actually go ahead
25:11 - and write the following so you just want
25:13 - to write not just body but
25:15 - everywhere right yeah exactly and you
25:17 - want to say margin
25:19 - zero and that will go ahead and get rid
25:20 - of that imaginary margin guys
25:23 - cool should i remove this from the body
25:27 - um you can do i mean i keep i've kept it
25:29 - there before because
25:30 - it doesn't really change anything but
25:31 - yeah we can remove that because we're
25:33 - already saying now
25:33 - appended like to everything uh change it
25:36 - yeah
25:36 - watch it's gonna break some snap
25:38 - functionality in the tik tok app later
25:47 - yeah awesome
25:50 - nice so now guys we have a clean slate
25:53 - right we have a clean place to start our
25:55 - work
25:56 - from um i think you need to re-follow me
25:58 - again quasi
25:59 - oh i thought okay there we go
26:02 - there we go nice uh so now what we can
26:04 - do is i am inside the app
26:06 - and guys this is where we kind of do our
26:08 - sort of what we like to do here is just
26:10 - kind of script out everything so what
26:11 - are we going to
26:12 - build first you know like what are we
26:14 - going to have uh inside of our
26:16 - and because this is different to a lot
26:17 - of our previous apps right
26:19 - this one is kind of it takes a different
26:21 - sort of turn because all we essentially
26:23 - have here
26:24 - is like a video carousel like when i say
26:26 - carousel it's like a swipeable video
26:28 - feed right
26:30 - so it's instead what we kind of have is
26:32 - we have the app
26:33 - right so we have this where it says
26:35 - hello clever programmers
26:36 - and what we're going to do is we're
26:37 - going to create a div right we're going
26:38 - to create a different we're going to say
26:39 - app underscore underscore videos
26:41 - because it's going to be essentially a
26:43 - container of videos and inside of here
26:46 - we're just going to essentially have a
26:47 - bunch of imagine they're just like video
26:50 - components so we're just going to render
26:52 - like a bunch of video components
26:54 - and this the end goal is that this
26:57 - is presented in such a way that we
26:59 - pretty much have
27:00 - the finished product so we can swipe
27:02 - through it so basically
27:04 - one one video component so basically
27:07 - when you say video component you're
27:08 - talking about like
27:10 - this video card as the video component
27:13 - or this video is the video component
27:15 - right
27:15 - yeah the entire card is the video
27:17 - component and inside of it we have lots
27:19 - of smaller components for example
27:22 - inside of that video component we have a
27:23 - video footer which is where it says
27:25 - champagne memory it has the music and
27:27 - everything
27:28 - and we also have a video sidebar which
27:30 - is where we have the
27:31 - heart the chat messages and the share
27:33 - button
27:34 - yep oh awesome guys we're up to 714
27:37 - people live
27:38 - watching this guys let's keep this
27:41 - energy flowing thank you guys so much
27:43 - and make sure guys smash that like
27:45 - button
27:45 - and let's just keep spreading this love
27:47 - because this build is gonna be
27:49 - super powerful and again remember you
27:52 - get to put all of this on your portfolio
27:53 - and everything like that so guys
27:55 - let's just keep the ball rolling on this
27:57 - amazing let's do it guys
27:59 - and we also thank you very much dhruv
28:00 - sharma for that uh super chat
28:03 - great work yeah oh yeah like a whatsapp
28:04 - clone we would definitely yeah we can
28:06 - make it well i think what's up club
28:07 - would be pretty cool
28:08 - that's actually even that's cool yeah
28:10 - somebody else the other day said a slack
28:11 - clone which would be kind of cool
28:13 - yep exactly i think people are going to
28:15 - yell at you for video card again
28:17 - uh but i think guys but it doesn't
28:20 - matter
28:20 - it's okay like main thing guys i wanna
28:23 - we wanna highlight here is let's break
28:24 - down this video component that we're
28:26 - gonna build because it's gonna be an
28:27 - important thing
28:28 - so this video component what are all the
28:30 - things it's going to have
28:32 - so sonny what's um it's going to have
28:35 - this thing over here right
28:37 - yep so we are going to have no no no so
28:39 - that's actually part of the video dude
28:41 - that's actually i said oh i see it
28:43 - that's part of the video so what is this
28:44 - going to have
28:45 - talk talk yes this is going to have a
28:48 - video footer element so it's going to
28:50 - have a video footer
28:51 - um at the bottom so we have where oh
28:54 - just one second we got a five euro super
28:56 - chat
28:59 - thank you thank you so much dude yeah
29:02 - you guys it's a lot of money you guys go
29:04 - crazy on this stuff thank you
29:07 - um all right let me put this here oh
29:09 - damn i
29:10 - removed everything all right let me go
29:12 - back
29:14 - boom okay cool so go go for it talk me
29:17 - through what is uh
29:19 - yeah we have the video footer which is
29:22 - going to represent
29:23 - the it says the name tags in this case
29:25 - it says champagne mommy it has the
29:27 - description it has the music
29:28 - and then it has that spinning record on
29:30 - the right side right
29:31 - so that's going to be the video footer
29:35 - right and we have the video sidebar
29:39 - and that's going to be where we see that
29:40 - heart where we see that chat where we
29:42 - see that
29:43 - share button right so they're going to
29:46 - be two different components and they're
29:47 - going to basically sit
29:48 - on top of the uh video
29:52 - and the photo footer has what the
29:54 - spinner
29:56 - yeah the photo has the spinner yeah and
29:57 - the disc is also part of the footer
30:00 - yep so the the little ticker which is
30:03 - that thing where it shows the song
30:05 - that's going to be um inside the we have
30:07 - the spinner which is the disc
30:09 - [Music]
30:11 - i see i got it yeah i see got it ticker
30:14 - and then
30:15 - the disc spinner yeah okay and i'm just
30:18 - gonna visually also draw it out guys so
30:21 - you know what
30:22 - exactly what we're gonna be building so
30:23 - when we say footer
30:25 - it's going to be this guy right here and
30:28 - i'm just gonna
30:29 - put a circle around it
30:32 - cool and then when we say video sidebar
30:36 - it's going to be this guy
30:39 - right over here okay does this make
30:42 - sense guys
30:42 - if this makes sense let me know and just
30:45 - drop it in the chat because like we
30:46 - don't want to move on unless these
30:48 - things make sense and you guys are able
30:49 - to follow along
30:50 - with us i think that's really really
30:52 - important so let me know if this makes
30:53 - sense so far
30:55 - yeah and all of this is going to be this
30:57 - is going to be one video component yeah
31:00 - exactly so the goal here is that we can
31:02 - literally just pop in video components
31:05 - with a bunch of props so props meaning
31:07 - properties which customize one component
31:09 - from another
31:10 - so that way they don't look the same
31:11 - every time we're basically going to pass
31:13 - in some props
31:14 - into that video component and it's
31:15 - basically going to just output that card
31:18 - so that what you see right now with that
31:20 - one sort of
31:20 - card and it's going to output that as a
31:22 - video component so it's very clean the
31:24 - end result
31:25 - but getting there is going to be a bit
31:26 - of a journey and we're going to show you
31:27 - all of that now
31:28 - um but like we see so when we scroll
31:30 - through those cards
31:32 - it pretty much will show you so pretty
31:34 - much imagine we're snapping on each of
31:36 - the different video components
31:38 - yeah yeah
31:41 - exactly awesome and then like look
31:43 - here's another video component
31:44 - here's another video component once you
31:46 - build it you guys can just keep reusing
31:49 - it again and again
31:51 - exactly awesome so then all you got to
31:53 - do
31:54 - is type this thing in
31:57 - video and then boom out you get this
32:00 - entire thing at once
32:04 - exactly dope beautiful so that would be
32:06 - the end result guys
32:08 - um so logan says are we eventually going
32:10 - to make a
32:11 - map a list of objects to create the
32:12 - components yes exactly
32:14 - uh i have a i have a question sunny for
32:16 - you yep
32:17 - would it uh would it ever help uh to
32:20 - have like
32:21 - additional components so for example
32:23 - what i mean by uh
32:24 - by that is like would it ever help to
32:27 - have
32:28 - you know say this thing be its own
32:31 - component
32:33 - yep you know this footer be its own
32:35 - component
32:37 - you know and then to combine it or is it
32:40 - better
32:41 - to just have all of that be part of one
32:44 - component
32:45 - so that's a really good question and
32:47 - yeah we actually do
32:48 - exactly that so inside of the video
32:50 - component
32:51 - we have the video component and the
32:53 - video sidebar component so the video for
32:57 - the the actual video component will be
32:59 - consist of
33:00 - two as well as two other components
33:03 - so you see we have this component tree
33:05 - right yeah
33:07 - so yeah you can keep nesting and that's
33:08 - honestly how apps are built guys like
33:10 - you end up having these really
33:11 - uh nested sort of apps with different
33:13 - components being reused in different
33:15 - places
33:16 - yeah i see because yeah because there's
33:17 - a video component if we have that right
33:19 - here
33:20 - that's gonna be using multiple things
33:23 - like it's going to be using the
33:25 - sidebar component so let's just say side
33:30 - and then it's going to be using the
33:33 - footer yep and
33:37 - it's also gonna be using the video
33:40 - itself
33:41 - exactly got it okay so that video is
33:44 - just built up of like
33:46 - two components plus itself exactly yeah
33:49 - cool okay awesome all right so
33:53 - let's let's keep it moving then nice so
33:56 - and now what we're going to do is we're
33:57 - actually going to go ahead and build
33:59 - that one that's
34:00 - a sort of template for that first video
34:02 - project so let's go ahead and do that so
34:04 - i'm going to create a so if you show the
34:06 - first file that we create and then after
34:08 - that i'll be i'll sort of just create
34:10 - them as we do it so
34:11 - to create the file guys we go inside
34:13 - here we click on the add file button
34:15 - so and then we basically go and go ahead
34:17 - and type in the video here so video.js
34:20 - and this is going to be the component
34:21 - for the video card right
34:23 - so then we're going to use a es7 snippet
34:25 - so it's a handy little extension
34:28 - and what we're going to do is rfce and
34:30 - that will go ahead and pop out
34:32 - that code for us really nice and
34:35 - once we do that guys it's always a good
34:37 - convention to go ahead and give it a
34:39 - class name so in this case what's the
34:41 - cast name going to be cozzy
34:43 - class name for what the
34:46 - div for this div video
34:49 - yep so just be class name is video and
34:52 - then what i'll do is while kazi writes
34:54 - that i'll go ahead and do an import
34:56 - and import the uh video.css
35:00 - file so video.css and let's go ahead and
35:03 - add
35:04 - the class name here so class name
35:08 - and let's do here video there we go nice
35:11 - nice so what i'm going to do now
35:12 - is i'm going to go ahead and create a
35:14 - video.css so video.css and we're jumping
35:17 - into that file
35:18 - now so we should be going into that now
35:21 - yeah there we go
35:22 - and now guys what we have is if i just
35:25 - do a lot i like to say it's just a h1 or
35:27 - something like ryan says
35:28 - um this is a video
35:32 - something like that right so this is a
35:34 - video and guys this is what we were
35:35 - saying before so imagine the end result
35:37 - is we're gonna have
35:38 - the video footer so imagine something
35:40 - like this it looks something like video
35:43 - you wanna you wanna decide i'm calling
35:45 - it video card
35:48 - um i think for now let's just call it
35:52 - the video we can call it yeah we can
35:55 - change it but
35:56 - in this build i think this goes video
35:58 - yeah all right steve you know it's going
36:00 - to break your heart
36:01 - but you know i tried i tried
36:06 - he's going crazy over it so we got video
36:09 - for a video signed
36:11 - sidebar sorry side bar there we go nice
36:14 - so we have the and that's basically
36:16 - what's gonna happen and that will give
36:18 - us the end result of the card right
36:20 - so um why do you have to import react in
36:23 - every component so yeah good question
36:24 - actually logan so logan asks why do we
36:26 - have to import react in every component
36:28 - so when you're using react components
36:30 - guys you just have to do this for every
36:32 - c or uh every file which is a component
36:34 - it's basically react's way of i mean
36:37 - it's a little sacrifice to pay
36:39 - for for what you're essentially getting
36:40 - back that that way it allows you it
36:42 - tells sort of
36:43 - react when it's compiling that this is
36:44 - jsx it tells you how to handle
36:47 - everything in terms of
36:47 - what is a function what is a class how
36:49 - to build that together into the final
36:51 - app
36:51 - but if you're if you're building a
36:53 - component then you have to have import
36:56 - react from react to the top of every uh
36:58 - react file
36:59 - so just something that you do have to do
37:01 - when you're using react which is
37:02 - actually a small price to pay compared
37:04 - to angular right so
37:05 - angular you have to have a huge amount
37:06 - of code just to get up and running
37:08 - um yeah so this is a video so they're
37:11 - nice
37:11 - and what we're going to do is we're
37:12 - going to go to appinapp.js and we're
37:13 - going to go ahead and import it so we do
37:15 - import
37:17 - video from video
37:21 - like that nice so you save it and now
37:24 - what we should see
37:25 - on our app so let's go ahead and open up
37:27 - our app quasi
37:32 - nice we see this is a video this is a
37:33 - video this is a video right
37:35 - so what we're going to do now is just to
37:37 - exaggerate this a bit
37:38 - so that way we can sort of see this
37:40 - visually in a very nice way i'm going to
37:42 - go ahead and give this something like a
37:43 - border
37:44 - one pixel solid black right one pixel
37:47 - solid black so imagine
37:48 - that's a video right here so imagine
37:52 - that's a video
37:54 - right so we can see now that we've got a
37:55 - bit of a bit of size to it and what i'm
37:57 - going to go ahead and do
37:58 - is give a width and height of 100
38:01 - because i want these videos to kind of
38:02 - take up the full width of the screen so
38:04 - let's see if that works
38:05 - in the way that we expected so right now
38:07 - that's actually only going to use up
38:08 - width of a
38:09 - height of 100 of what its parent is
38:12 - right
38:12 - so at this point actually we may be able
38:14 - to if i just demonstrate a slightly
38:17 - so we do height of let's just say 100
38:19 - pixels
38:21 - so 100 pixels in height and that should
38:23 - give it a bit more sort of size to it so
38:25 - let's go ahead and exaggerate that let's
38:26 - say 500 pixels
38:29 - nice so you see like everyone's kind of
38:31 - like a video right at this point
38:32 - so what we're going to do now is we're
38:35 - going to go over to
38:36 - app.css so app.css
38:39 - where is it app.css and we are going to
38:42 - go and do the following so this is where
38:44 - it is honestly this is where the magic
38:46 - kind of happens guys
38:47 - so annoyingly we have to kind of add
38:51 - this rule so i found that like there was
38:52 - a bug with react when you're doing this
38:54 - but you have to do the following you
38:55 - have to say for in html so you have to
38:57 - target html
38:58 - and you have to add this line of code
39:00 - right and this this is basically some of
39:02 - the magic that allows you
39:03 - to have that snap functionality so you
39:05 - need to say in the html
39:08 - make scroll snap type to y because it's
39:11 - vertical
39:12 - right and make it mandatory right so
39:14 - this is just something we have to
39:15 - include
39:16 - and i found i did try and test it and i
39:18 - tried to test it with and without
39:19 - uh without that rule in react it just
39:21 - wasn't working so um i
39:23 - we do need that rule okay now what we're
39:25 - going to do is we're going to go ahead
39:27 - and say
39:28 - so the first thing that we're gonna do
39:29 - is go ahead and say um
39:31 - that the app videos so let's go ahead
39:34 - and open this file we can see
39:35 - all of the videos sit inside of this
39:37 - container app videos right
39:39 - so we're gonna go ahead and do dot app
39:40 - videos and here i'm going to say
39:43 - position is relative to its parent so
39:46 - this is a rule which is basically the
39:47 - reason why we have this is because
39:49 - later on you see how the final app was
39:51 - centered so
39:52 - they'll come into play as to why we do
39:54 - that right they'll come and display us
39:55 - why we do that afterwards
39:56 - but what i want is essentially to have
39:58 - it so that even no matter what screen
40:00 - you're on
40:00 - that app videos it's going to have like
40:02 - a set sort of phone
40:04 - kind of shape to it so it always kind of
40:06 - looks like it's a phone
40:07 - so what i'm going to do is give it a
40:08 - height of 800 pixels
40:11 - uh and we save it and let's see what
40:12 - that does so you can see that's going to
40:15 - give us a height of 800 pixels
40:17 - but right now if we do overflow hidden
40:19 - you'll see
40:20 - why so right now it doesn't actually
40:21 - look like much happen but if i do
40:23 - overflow hidden
40:24 - you will see that it will actually
40:26 - should go ahead and
40:27 - hide the the rest of it so um let me see
40:29 - why that's not playing so we got an
40:31 - import
40:32 - app videos we go back to app.css our
40:35 - videos
40:36 - okay interesting so now what we can do
40:38 - is
40:39 - let me go ahead and debug this one
40:41 - second guys
40:43 - if i pull this over to my screen so i
40:45 - can see it
40:46 - so we have this is the video oh yeah
40:47 - nice yeah you can actually see that so
40:49 - if i go ahead and make this smaller it's
40:51 - because everything's white
40:52 - right so if i go ahead and make this 500
40:54 - pixels watch how it cuts off
40:57 - right so you see it will actually cut
40:58 - off the where it says this is a video
41:00 - so it is actually sort of cutting at
41:03 - this point because of overflow hidden so
41:05 - what we want is we want to keep it at
41:06 - 800 pixels but we want the overflow to
41:08 - be scroll
41:09 - right and what this would mean now is if
41:11 - cause if you just go ahead and scroll
41:13 - through this you'll see that there's a
41:15 - scroll bar now
41:19 - right can you see that so there's now a
41:20 - scroll bar scrolling yeah the whole time
41:27 - yeah so you see it's scrolling now so
41:29 - and you see a hello clever programmer
41:31 - stays at the top so we have like this
41:32 - container which is scrollable
41:34 - right nice which is awesome oh so
41:37 - i see so it's not like the whole page is
41:39 - actually scrolling it's the
41:41 - four components or five components of
41:43 - video that you have
41:44 - that are actually in a container and
41:46 - they're scrolling because
41:48 - i mean nor initially i thought this was
41:50 - a sticky header
41:51 - but it's not just a sticky header
41:52 - because okay got it
41:54 - that makes sense right yeah
41:57 - so now that container that uh kazi
41:59 - mentioned is called app videos app
42:01 - underscore underscore
42:02 - videos and then we have our overflow
42:04 - scroll which is why we can scroll
42:05 - through it
42:05 - so what we're going to do now is we're
42:07 - going to have
42:09 - a width of 80 because i don't want it to
42:11 - be take up all of that room right so i'm
42:13 - going to go ahead and give it a width of
42:14 - 80
42:15 - and you're gonna see that that should
42:16 - come in a bit more so you can see now
42:18 - it's sort of coming a bit more
42:20 - nice right so that's pretty cool and
42:22 - we're going to say a max width of 500
42:24 - pixels that way when you go on big
42:25 - devices it's going to limit it
42:28 - right but the magic here guys actually
42:30 - happens with this next line so remember
42:32 - we added this to html but you also need
42:34 - to add it to your
42:35 - container that you're applying the rule
42:37 - to so here i'm going to say scroll snap
42:39 - type
42:40 - y mandatory right and what this is
42:42 - saying is like
42:43 - set a scrolling snap uh like mode
42:47 - to a vertical axis so we're saying like
42:49 - you wanted to basically
42:50 - sort of look out for any snap kind of
42:52 - events where we want to snap to
42:54 - different points and this will make
42:56 - sense in a second guys so
42:57 - that's pretty cool but it we don't
42:59 - actually tell it so how does it know
43:00 - when to what to snap to etc how does it
43:03 - know that right
43:04 - so the way we do that is we go to the
43:05 - video right
43:07 - we go to video and what we do is we go
43:09 - to the video child
43:10 - and we say scroll snap align right so we
43:14 - say scroll snap align
43:16 - start right and then here
43:19 - what i'm going to go ahead and do is set
43:21 - this to be
43:22 - something called position so this one is
43:25 - going to be position
43:26 - relative and relative means that it's
43:28 - now relative to its parent
43:29 - which means that we're talking about the
43:30 - app videos container so it basically
43:33 - changes some of the measurements inside
43:34 - of it
43:35 - and then we're going to set the width
43:36 - and height to 100 so width
43:39 - because a hundred percent height is at a
43:42 - hundred percent
43:44 - nice and then we go ahead and remove the
43:47 - width tonight real quick
43:48 - thank you guys so much we just broke 10
43:50 - 000 views
43:52 - you guys are amazing that's insane dude
43:56 - that's insane wow it's like in 40
43:58 - minutes today actually
43:59 - so that is huge you guys really
44:02 - appreciate you guys are helping us just
44:04 - crush it uh if you guys are enjoying
44:06 - this so far and you guys are enjoying
44:07 - what sunny has put together for you guys
44:09 - make sure to smash that like button yeah
44:12 - we love that guys it's going to help
44:14 - more people reach this video which is
44:15 - going to be always nicer right
44:17 - so quasi go ahead and swipe on that box
44:20 - now and see what happens
44:21 - okay so i'll okay so when you say swipe
44:24 - you mean just scroll yeah so if you
44:27 - scroll is it snapping now
44:29 - ah yeah so okay hold on yeah i can
44:32 - actually i see
44:33 - it like snaps snaps yep
44:36 - yeah so as soon as you sort of swipe now
44:38 - it's going to snap so if you swipe
44:40 - enough it'll snap to the next one
44:42 - and it'll snap underneath that's
44:43 - basically that that whole thing happened
44:46 - guys
44:46 - from these two rows so we set the
44:49 - container so this magic line
44:51 - oh i have to actually let it go so watch
44:53 - this right so if i scroll down and i let
44:55 - it go boom snaps
44:56 - scroll down let it go snaps scroll down
44:59 - snap oh that is clean
45:03 - and it works in both directions as well
45:04 - which is now ah look at that so
45:07 - boom snap this is what what the
45:09 - functionality is gonna look like
45:11 - guys if you think that's cool drop a
45:12 - comment below and let us know if you
45:14 - think that
45:15 - if you find this to be like super sweet
45:17 - like look at that ah
45:18 - like i just scrolled down a little bit
45:21 - that's really cool
45:22 - and also guys we just hit a thousand
45:24 - likes that's insane dude
45:26 - oh my god thousand like
45:30 - when said it was a thousand like oh my
45:32 - god
45:34 - amazing amazing seriously that's insane
45:37 - thank you guys and yeah we're
45:38 - even the chat donations or super chats
45:42 - at 13
45:43 - which is crazy we just kind of got
45:44 - started
45:47 - exactly
45:50 - right so what we're going to do now is
45:53 - we are going to go ahead
45:55 - and check out the so yeah those two
45:58 - lines of code are magic guys
45:59 - so you see the scroll snap type why
46:01 - mandatory and then we actually go
46:03 - ahead to the chart and say scroll snap a
46:04 - line start where jess
46:06 - singh just gave us a donation thank you
46:08 - so much he says great work guys keep it
46:10 - up
46:10 - we appreciate that thank you so much
46:13 - damn thank you
46:15 - nice so what i'm going to do now guys is
46:17 - sort of emphasize that sort of phone
46:19 - look right so we wanted to kind of look
46:20 - a bit more like a phone
46:22 - so at this point what we can go ahead
46:23 - and do is go back to app.css
46:25 - and let me just sort of black out the
46:27 - background so it looks a bit more sort
46:28 - of like you know like a bit more dynamic
46:30 - and sort of interesting
46:32 - so i'm going to go to your app um
46:35 - the actual app itself and what i'm going
46:37 - to do is so say i'm going to say app
46:40 - and i'm going to say app is referring to
46:42 - this by the way guys so this outside
46:44 - container right here
46:45 - so i'm going to go to app and i'm going
46:46 - to say background color so
46:48 - background color of black there we go
46:51 - and i'm going to save that and look at
46:54 - that guys so the whole thing's black
46:55 - right now all right so it's kind of
46:56 - confusing you already know what's going
46:58 - on here
46:59 - um but what we're gonna do is just to
47:00 - say emphasize everything we're gonna
47:02 - make this one
47:03 - have a white background uh border
47:06 - so we can kind of maybe see it a bit
47:08 - clearer yeah so you can see that we've
47:09 - got that black black background color
47:11 - and then here i'm going to make a
47:12 - background color of white
47:15 - so now if i save that should we
47:18 - see this is the video a and then we go
47:20 - let's go ahead and make this one like
47:21 - let's call it let's just make it red
47:22 - so i'm going to emphasize all this stuff
47:24 - so you can see it a bit clearer right
47:26 - so you see now it's got sort of a red
47:27 - border and let's go ahead and make that
47:28 - five pixels so it's very pronounced
47:31 - right so there we go so this is a video
47:33 - and then now if you sort of snap scroll
47:34 - through them
47:35 - so cause if you scroll through it now it
47:37 - should actually be very clear as to uh
47:39 - sort of that snapping because i've got a
47:40 - red border snap
47:42 - snap snap snap city
47:46 - i love this yeah and you see like
47:50 - in the tick tock clone we don't see
47:51 - those uh scroll bars right
47:53 - so a lot of people when they want to
47:55 - hide the scroll bar they go ahead and do
47:56 - something like this they say overflow
47:58 - hidden or something like that right
48:00 - don't do that guys because you actually
48:02 - lose the scroll functionality
48:03 - so you that's sort of like a rookie
48:06 - mistake you don't want to do that
48:07 - instead you want this snippet here so
48:09 - it's these lines of codes right here
48:11 - so these ones are right here so what
48:13 - this is saying is saying add videos
48:15 - go ahead and access the webkit scroll
48:17 - bar and say display
48:19 - none so you keep the functionality and
48:21 - what this one's going to do it's going
48:22 - to hide the scroll bar for chrome safari
48:24 - and oprah
48:25 - and for this one you need to do a
48:27 - different one for internet explorer edge
48:28 - and firefox
48:30 - and these are the rules that you need to
48:31 - apply so this basically you can go ahead
48:33 - and copy that
48:34 - so since we were since we were talking
48:36 - about snapping i got something for you
48:38 - guys
48:44 - i'm actually going to be bringing in
48:45 - lots of gifs i just had a breakthrough
48:48 - idea yeah we should we should like hook
48:51 - them up to the stream deck you know
48:53 - yeah oh yeah that's actually smart yeah
48:58 - so so now if i click save guys notice
49:00 - how that scroll bar is going to
49:02 - disappear now
49:03 - which is super clean so now when we're
49:05 - scrolling through it it's just going to
49:07 - pretty much not have a scroll bar which
49:08 - looks even nicer
49:09 - ah no scroll bar let's but it still
49:13 - snaps
49:13 - and no scroll bar keep the scroll
49:16 - functionality but then not have the
49:18 - scroll bar right
49:19 - you know what i gotta do for that one
49:22 - [Laughter]
49:25 - now we're gonna do color white i think
49:27 - let's try and do color white here
49:29 - and save and let me see if we can do
49:31 - that so okay
49:33 - so i'm not going to do that here but we
49:34 - can see there's still some text at the
49:36 - top right so what i'm going to go ahead
49:37 - and do is
49:37 - delete that text so there we go and
49:41 - now it should snap to the top of the
49:43 - screen and you see
49:44 - right so this is this is okay but it's
49:46 - not ideal right we don't really want
49:48 - this to be the case so
49:49 - for app what i'm going to first say is
49:51 - 100 so a height of 100 view height so
49:54 - 100
49:54 - view height if i do that firstly you'll
49:57 - reach the bottom of the page
49:58 - so there we go and now i want that stack
50:01 - container to actually take up the middle
50:04 - of the screen and kazi i found this out
50:06 - in a really nice
50:07 - google chat that i popped in the sort of
50:09 - team channel the other day
50:11 - and basically what you can do is this
50:13 - really nice little hack
50:15 - and the hack is um you basically what is
50:17 - this hack for
50:19 - so it's basically you see that container
50:21 - you have here so
50:22 - it says this is a video yeah if you want
50:24 - to center anything
50:25 - right all you need to do is do display
50:28 - so it's really nice you say display grid
50:31 - and then you say
50:32 - place items so place items
50:36 - center and now what happens when i send
50:38 - to this that when i save this sorry
50:40 - so oh
50:45 - dang that's it that's cool right and it
50:48 - literally will always be center
50:50 - like which is such a nice little hack
50:52 - that is clean
50:54 - yeah so it's a really really nice one
50:56 - okay here a really newbie
50:58 - question but like what happens if i do
51:00 - like literally i wrap it in html center
51:03 - tag
51:04 - which is as far as my css skills go
51:08 - i mean that might be curious that might
51:12 - work
51:15 - let's go ahead and try it
51:17 - [Laughter]
51:18 - if that works that would be mind-blowing
51:20 - dude i'm gonna quit
51:23 - because that's my hack you know that's
51:25 - how i freaking do this stuff
51:28 - let's wrap it you i don't know what is
51:30 - up with that like little weird
51:32 - yeah i know right why do you say if this
51:34 - works dude
51:37 - okay okay so let's send is it it centers
51:40 - it horizontally
51:41 - but then but not on the vertical yeah
51:44 - not bad actually
51:45 - but still that's a pretty good hack guys
51:47 - like if anyone found that
51:56 - yeah you can use that you can definitely
51:58 - use it and that's a very quick way of
51:59 - doing that so nice um
52:01 - what we're going to do now is go ahead
52:02 - and uncomment these ones
52:04 - because that will center it both
52:05 - vertical and horizontally yeah some
52:07 - people lost their minds when you showed
52:08 - the grid one jaya is like
52:10 - that is insane
52:13 - hey oh steve said yay sunny has learned
52:17 - uh
52:18 - great honestly we'll do some more videos
52:20 - on grid because grid's really powerful
52:21 - guys
52:22 - it's really really powerful and nice to
52:23 - use um
52:26 - leroy says yo guy kaz you gotta make up
52:29 - video on the behind the scenes
52:31 - for all the prep that goes into these
52:33 - live videos that actually could be cool
52:35 - yeah dude i if i did that you guys would
52:38 - see the frustration of coding
52:41 - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sunny will come
52:44 - to me and i'm like sonny this
52:45 - sucks what is this people are going to
52:47 - be pissed when they see this come on
52:49 - we got to step it up
52:54 - so now what we're going to do is
52:58 - we are going to go ahead and check on so
53:01 - go to app.js and
53:03 - firebase let's see we've got app.css so
53:06 - now we're going to do guys is actually
53:07 - go ahead and focus on that video card
53:10 - so what i'm going to do is inside the
53:13 - video
53:14 - card so let's go ahead and open that
53:16 - what we're going to have in here guys is
53:18 - remember we had this is the video
53:19 - and then we have the video for and the
53:20 - video sidebar right so
53:22 - for the first one what i'm going to go
53:24 - ahead and do is just type in video
53:26 - and my emmett pops in like that and this
53:29 - one i'm going to have
53:30 - no image no video and to begin with so
53:32 - if i go ahead and just save that it's
53:33 - actually going to go ahead and
53:35 - not do much for me so it's going to head
53:37 - in so you see like
53:38 - it just seems like a white page right
53:40 - now right so i'm going to go ahead and
53:41 - just find the url
53:42 - so i'll use the one that we had
53:44 - previously oh my mouse just found the
53:46 - time to die there we go
53:48 - um so i love that snapping functionality
53:53 - yeah it's clean right so now i'm going
53:55 - to go ahead and grab
53:56 - a link of a video so guys if you do want
53:59 - to use whatever video you want
54:00 - just go over to tick tock so
54:02 - ticktock.com and all you need to do to
54:04 - get it working is go ahead and just
54:06 - pretty much right click and inspect and
54:08 - copy the source
54:10 - of a video so in this case like it's a
54:11 - massive url so i'm not going to go ahead
54:13 - and
54:13 - copy that into the the screen because
54:16 - guys like it's better you just go on
54:18 - tick tock and grab that so in this case
54:19 - we've got a video here right so now
54:22 - we've got a video
54:23 - and what we can go ahead and do is go
54:26 - ahead and add a class name first because
54:28 - right now it's not styled right so it's
54:30 - not started but every single one is that
54:32 - same video card
54:33 - right but we want to basically style it
54:34 - so that we have something there so let's
54:36 - go ahead and do
54:37 - video class name so class name equals
54:41 - and i'm going to say video underscore
54:43 - underscore and let's just call it the
54:44 - player
54:44 - right it's a video player or like in
54:46 - this case yes i and and this is where
54:48 - steve is going to say sonny i told you
54:50 - we should have video card video but i
54:52 - know i know
54:53 - i was thinking the same thing i'm like
54:54 - bro we're gonna there's gonna be video
54:57 - and then video card
54:58 - but it's okay yeah it's always gonna be
55:01 - a naming thing guys but in this case
55:02 - we've got video player
55:04 - um and then what i'm to go ahead and do
55:05 - is video player is referring to
55:07 - that video right so if i go into the css
55:10 - now
55:11 - for that video player what i want to do
55:12 - is firstly actually
55:14 - to make it a little bit more prettier
55:15 - let's go ahead to app.js and let's give
55:17 - it a rounded border radius
55:19 - inside that container over here and
55:21 - let's give it a branded border radius
55:22 - for 20 pixels so
55:24 - look what happens when i do that you see
55:26 - we get a nice sort of rounded
55:28 - corner on that tick tock display which
55:30 - is kind of nice
55:31 - that's how tick-tock have it yeah
55:35 - yeah we can go ahead and get rid of that
55:36 - red border that we were showing earlier
55:39 - uh awesome so if i go ahead and get rid
55:41 - of that so now we've got that
55:42 - so what i can do is go to that border uh
55:45 - border
55:46 - a video player sorry and i can say set
55:48 - the background color
55:49 - to black in case the video ever sort of
55:51 - resizes and now
55:52 - i'll show what that does so right now
55:54 - let's exaggerate it and set it to red
55:56 - and i'll show you why we do that and
55:57 - then what we need to do is we need to
55:58 - set
55:59 - the following we need to set height and
56:00 - width of 100 and object
56:02 - fit to type fill right so i'm going to
56:05 - show you this
56:06 - and what i'll do is i'll demo exactly
56:08 - what this does but as soon as i hit save
56:10 - guys notice how it basically brought in
56:12 - the exact size of the video so before it
56:14 - wasn't actually the correct size and if
56:16 - i go ahead and do width of 50
56:17 - and i get rid of object type object fit
56:20 - fill
56:20 - look what happens so you see that nice
56:24 - yeah so that's why i've done the
56:26 - background color as red but if i was to
56:28 - now go ahead and do object
56:30 - fit fill yeah look what it will do it
56:32 - will fill up that 50
56:34 - and then obviously what we can do then
56:36 - is make it 100
56:37 - and we then get a perfect coverage right
56:41 - but we do want to account for the
56:42 - background color so i mean in this case
56:44 - it's fine we can
56:45 - we can actually go ahead and get rid of
56:46 - that so object fit fill height and width
56:48 - of 100 and now we get the perfect sort
56:50 - of sizing so
56:51 - now as you scroll through them you've
56:52 - actually got perfectly sized videos
56:56 - all right so your perfectly sized videos
56:58 - by the way thank you so much
56:59 - phil philippe uh duarte gory i
57:03 - really appreciate that five euro
57:05 - donation thank you and he says guys to
57:07 - import
57:07 - components use control plus space
57:11 - and then press tab but it doesn't work
57:14 - for all
57:15 - keep smashing greetings from brazil
57:17 - awesome thank you so much
57:20 - yeah we try and do that actually on the
57:21 - live stream but when we're using vs live
57:23 - stream it doesn't always work but
57:25 - i always actually do use that shortcut
57:27 - really really good shortcut to use it's
57:28 - a really good shortcut to use so what
57:30 - he's talking about is like if we ever go
57:31 - to any of our files like app.js
57:33 - all these import statements you don't
57:35 - have to write them you can actually go
57:36 - to the end
57:37 - of the thing and then actually hit
57:39 - control space
57:41 - doesn't always work but when it does
57:42 - it's really nice
57:44 - yeah and it will pop up a little drop
57:46 - down you click video and then it will
57:48 - import the video file for you which is
57:49 - awesome yeah
57:51 - right so now what we're going to go
57:53 - ahead and do
57:55 - is actually go ahead and say so the
57:57 - first thing is videos actually have this
57:59 - uh
57:59 - attribute called loop so we want when
58:02 - the video finishes playing we want it to
58:03 - loop through so let's go ahead and do
58:05 - loop
58:06 - um no
58:09 - i just reading my my hair is like sonny
58:12 - looks so
58:13 - fat in this video that's what i was
58:15 - saying and it's because the
58:19 - [ __ ] just destroying your self-esteem
58:23 - yeah yeah on youtube
58:30 - hey man you gotta start working out more
58:32 - you gotta start you know yeah
58:33 - lockdown was uh lockdown wasn't the
58:35 - kindest at times
58:38 - guys that just goes to show you you can
58:39 - still get a girlfriend when you look
58:40 - like you get
58:41 - a bit weight you can still get a
58:43 - girlfriend there you go
58:44 - yeah as long as you learn react that's
58:47 - when
58:48 - yeah like then react that's that's the
58:50 - hack that's the only reason i got mad
58:52 - [Laughter]
58:54 - if you make the height even smaller
58:55 - you're gonna be even fatter
58:58 - yeah exactly remember we were messing
59:00 - around with this earlier guys and we're
59:02 - just having some fun and changing this
59:03 - to
59:04 - 80 pixels 80 and look what happens like
59:07 - uh
59:07 - because you're trying to debug it and
59:09 - like yeah okay then you're super fat
59:15 - wow awesome
59:18 - right so uh next let's go ahead
59:21 - and uh uh hona says you guys are making
59:25 - programming fun
59:26 - nice love that thank you um so what we
59:29 - want to do now is we actually want to go
59:30 - ahead and let's
59:31 - let's tackle the problem that is uh kind
59:34 - of like a we don't know how to address
59:35 - this in the beginning right so
59:37 - like in the beginning i was kind of
59:38 - thinking how do i
59:40 - basically on videos i don't want to show
59:42 - the controls right so you can actually
59:44 - go ahead and do something like this you
59:45 - can say controls
59:46 - and what this will do is i'm sure it's
59:48 - controls and this will go ahead and
59:50 - actually refresh the page but it will
59:51 - show the player control so you see now
59:52 - we've got a plus
59:53 - play button at the bottom so you can go
59:55 - ahead and play the video
59:56 - and it will work in that way but we
59:58 - don't want nice do you have instagram
60:00 - what like i see so you what you want it
60:03 - like this
60:04 - where i just click it and then it does
60:07 - instagram and then i can click and pause
60:10 - exactly when we click it it will play as
60:12 - opposed to like
60:13 - being any different right so um so now
60:16 - i'm going to go so i'm going to go ahead
60:17 - and remove that controls right
60:19 - but how do we have it like how do i
60:21 - target
60:22 - this video like how do i how do i even
60:24 - go about that right
60:25 - so the way we do that is we actually use
60:27 - a reference right so a reference
60:29 - in um in react basically refers to we
60:32 - want to
60:32 - we need to capture some kind of
60:34 - reference
60:35 - to this video right so so that we can
60:39 - actually go ahead and do things like
60:40 - video dot play video dot pause right but
60:43 - at the moment we can't actually do that
60:45 - right so what i need to do is i need to
60:47 - go ahead and say const
60:48 - and let's just call it video ref so it
60:50 - stands for video reference
60:51 - i'm going to say use ref and though it's
60:54 - like there's use state use effect use
60:56 - all these other things
60:56 - use ref is just another hook and in the
60:58 - beginning
60:59 - what we say is we say give it a value of
61:01 - no so there shouldn't be a reference in
61:03 - the beginning right
61:05 - the way we the way we actually attach
61:07 - that reference is super
61:09 - simple with hooks it's really easy to
61:11 - attach that reference we go to
61:12 - the video and we just basically say ref
61:14 - equals video ref
61:16 - and that will do all the work for us so
61:17 - that will actually go ahead and attach a
61:19 - reference
61:20 - to um the video ref so now we've
61:23 - actually got the video ref
61:25 - and real quick overall what what are we
61:27 - trying to work on right now
61:28 - the video component yeah so we're
61:31 - working on getting the video to play
61:33 - when we tap it
61:35 - okay yeah so we're getting it to work so
61:38 - when we tap it
61:39 - um and the way we need to do that is we
61:40 - need a reference to be able to say that
61:42 - like
61:43 - so that eventually what we can do is we
61:44 - can say something like this we can say
61:46 - video ref
61:46 - dot uh play video ref dot
61:49 - pause right something like that
61:53 - right so when we tap the video how can
61:56 - we capture that click
61:57 - or tap right so in this case we can use
61:59 - on click right so we can say on click
62:01 - so we're all familiar with like an on
62:03 - click right so here we can just say on
62:04 - click
62:05 - and then let's go ahead and make a
62:06 - function called on video press
62:08 - right so i'm going to create a function
62:10 - called on video press so now
62:11 - what i'm going to do is i'll say const
62:14 - oops const
62:15 - i'll say on video press on video press
62:19 - all right and this is basically going to
62:21 - go ahead and be
62:22 - a function and what we're going to do
62:24 - now is i'm basically just to test this
62:26 - guys
62:26 - what we're going to say is we're going
62:27 - to say video ref and then once you have
62:30 - a reference you need to do something
62:31 - dot and then you actually go ahead and
62:33 - type current so you're saying the
62:35 - current reference whatever it's attached
62:36 - to
62:37 - get that reference and then you say dot
62:39 - and then you actually get the object so
62:40 - in this case we've got the video now and
62:42 - we can say play
62:43 - right so let's go ahead and save this
62:47 - and now kazi if you click play on that
62:50 - so we need to import the user
62:54 - by the way somebody in the comments uh
62:56 - said get
62:57 - an extension on visual studio code
63:01 - called auto import and that app
63:04 - apparently works all the time that's
63:07 - good um but my own experience with that
63:10 - guys is it started to import like the
63:12 - wrong imports at times
63:14 - so uh sometimes when you import things
63:16 - you've got like a bunch of different
63:17 - options so
63:19 - it can have its sort of good and bad
63:20 - size that's where that's where i've seen
63:22 - this is one of those things where when i
63:24 - say jetbrains ide
63:25 - like they nail that stuff like they have
63:29 - never
63:29 - failed me on that like ever so yeah
63:32 - i mean i don't know how it is for react
63:34 - but like for python it's
63:36 - king yeah i guess python's been out a
63:39 - long time compared to react as well so
63:41 - they're
63:41 - slowly getting out the kings yeah got it
63:46 - okay so now what you want to do guys is
63:48 - go ahead and cause if you just go ahead
63:50 - and click the video
63:51 - uh-huh so click on the video yeah
63:54 - you'll see it like it should snap start
64:00 - yeah you can't pause it right so that's
64:02 - a problem
64:03 - like we can play it but we need to be
64:04 - able to pause it but right now we have
64:06 - no way of telling if it's actually
64:08 - playing or not
64:09 - so the way that we tackle this problem
64:12 - is we use a piece of state so here i'm
64:14 - going to say
64:15 - const and i'm going to create a piece of
64:16 - state so in react this is how you
64:18 - essentially write a react variable
64:20 - so you say play is the react of the
64:22 - variable name
64:23 - and set play is what allows us to change
64:25 - it right so
64:28 - here i'm going to say use state so use
64:30 - state and by default the video is not
64:32 - going to be playing so we're going to
64:33 - say false
64:34 - right so we need to go ahead and import
64:36 - this so i go here and i say use state
64:38 - import
64:38 - and then we've got the play and we've
64:40 - got set play right now what we're going
64:42 - to do is we're going to say
64:45 - we are now going to say if the video so
64:48 - if
64:48 - play so if the video is playing then we
64:51 - want to go ahead and pause the video so
64:53 - we're going to say
64:54 - go ahead and pause the video else like
64:56 - if
64:57 - else if the video is not playing so if
64:59 - it was already paused
65:01 - then go ahead and play the video
65:04 - and now by using a piece of state what
65:07 - we're actually going to go ahead and do
65:08 - and
65:08 - remember guys what we need to do is
65:09 - that's not everything by the way so
65:11 - if it's playing we need to pause it and
65:14 - then we need to set the state
65:16 - to tell it that it's now playing uh now
65:18 - that tonight is now pause sorry so we
65:19 - need to say set play false
65:21 - and then when it's not playing and we
65:22 - play it we do set play
65:25 - steve says uh playing karma
65:28 - set playing steve
65:31 - wins this war steve winslow there you go
65:36 - i'll change these two there you go
65:39 - playing playing there you go that's nice
65:42 - if playing
65:42 - then pause it make sure you're playing
65:45 - make sure current.playing is capitalized
65:47 - so it probably has to be
65:50 - oh yeah this should be play oops yeah
65:55 - like the grammar police of react.js
65:57 - developers
65:59 - yeah i mean today dammit you know like
66:01 - i've had people saying
66:02 - oh
66:08 - [Laughter]
66:11 - oh man guys give give sonny some love
66:13 - you know in the comments below because
66:15 - it seems like there are a lot of people
66:16 - trying to break down break him down you
66:19 - know
66:20 - oh man i mean like you do you do like
66:22 - weeks of live streams and then you
66:23 - slowly get shot
66:26 - doesn't sort of play in your head i know
66:30 - if we now go ahead and so some people
66:33 - are saying
66:33 - you can use a single line if else you
66:36 - can't because there's two
66:37 - there's um two lines of code here if you
66:39 - add one line of code yeah you can make
66:41 - this single line but you you don't
66:42 - i mean sometimes guys it's actually
66:44 - easier just having it written like this
66:45 - me and kazi
66:46 - had this debate um it is just nicer
66:48 - having it as a
66:49 - as a normal if block rather than having
66:52 - like a
66:52 - ternary or tertiary or whatever it's
66:54 - called so now if you play the video
66:56 - you can actually go ahead and play it
66:58 - and you can pause it now if you click it
67:00 - so go ahead let's try it do you have
67:03 - instagram
67:04 - no snapchat nice i can actually pause it

67:12 - putting it pretty low
67:16 - cool awesome got it awesome so now you
67:19 - can see it's
67:19 - it's uh it's like when we click it and
67:22 - when we uh

69:07 - import that so we're going to say
69:08 - import or import video for
69:12 - from video footer
69:15 - and then do that nice um
69:19 - so he says i need some more coffee nice
69:21 - um so now what we're gonna do is
69:23 - wrecking you i've been seeing him in the
69:27 - chat he's like sonny needs more energy
69:29 - sunnyvale
69:31 - pattan amez is on fire today dude

69:49 - have some crazy [ __ ]
69:51 - yeah yeah no guys just keep uh
69:53 - positivity alive in here and let's keep
69:56 - it going
69:57 - nice so we're gonna create it's gonna
69:59 - freak out now because we haven't got
70:00 - video footer.css and i'm going to do
70:02 - video
70:03 - footer damn nicholas says i love this
70:06 - community
70:07 - i am reacting positively
70:10 - to the state and effect of these
70:12 - tutorials
70:13 - you guys are serving it hot
70:17 - nice that's awesome dude
70:20 - oh i'm stuck she said i roast him for
70:24 - free
70:26 - you know what's hilarious is we should
70:29 - actually make
70:30 - a shirt and that should say react
70:32 - positively
70:33 - oh yeah dude that's what i mean we
70:35 - should do that
70:37 - like that like manage your state
70:40 - you know yeah like that actually could
70:43 - be really
70:44 - cool exactly that'll be amazing we
70:47 - should uh yeah
70:47 - yeah that oh yeah manage your state oh
70:50 - damn
70:51 - yeah i like that i like that right so
70:54 - now what we're gonna do
70:55 - is go ahead and check on the video so we
70:58 - go video footer
71:00 - and we are going to go ahead and say
71:02 - position
71:03 - relative so video for position relative
71:06 - nice
71:07 - so it's basically relative to its parent
71:08 - but the reason why we're doing that
71:10 - every time guys is because
71:12 - when you do a relative it means that
71:13 - it's gonna basically all the rules are
71:15 - just gonna apply from within it's
71:17 - within that parent container right so
71:20 - sometimes especially when you start
71:21 - doing nested things like um
71:23 - absolute positioning and stuff you have
71:25 - to do that otherwise it can kind of get
71:26 - a bit
71:27 - annoying right so what we're going to do
71:29 - now is we're going to go over to
71:30 - uh video footer and we're going to go
71:32 - and say let me just pull it up
71:35 - so video4.css uh yeah so now what i'm
71:39 - going to go ahead
71:40 - and do is actually right now we can't
71:42 - actually see it
71:43 - right we can't actually see the video
71:44 - for us so we're actually rendering it on
71:46 - the screen
71:46 - we do video footer here
71:49 - um but let's go ahead and see if we're
71:51 - actually popping it out so video
71:53 - footer and here we say i am a footer so
71:57 - it should actually be showing
71:59 - so in order to get that out i think we
72:01 - need to go ahead and do
72:04 - we're going to say okay so we need to
72:05 - say as the bottom firstly so video
72:07 - footer dot css
72:09 - save it and i'm going to say bottom 50
72:11 - pixels so that means that
72:13 - from the bottom of the screen so from
72:15 - the bottom i want to be 50 pixels up
72:17 - so can you see now it's actually very
72:19 - hard to see but if i do go ahead and
72:20 - make the color white
72:22 - uh color white look what happens now so
72:25 - you can see at the bottom it says i am a
72:26 - photo oh god freaking out
72:28 - so now you can see i am
72:31 - a uh so you can see now we've got
72:35 - uh yeah so it says i am a footer and the
72:37 - color is white right
72:38 - oh nice sambulocenda said uh just

73:24 - is we are now going to bit so you can
73:27 - see
73:27 - it says i am a footer at the bottom of
73:29 - the screen right yeah so obviously right
73:31 - now that doesn't look great that doesn't
73:32 - really really look like we want
73:35 - so we're going to go ahead and put some
73:36 - information in there so we're basically
73:38 - going to do a bit of an outline first
73:39 - right so
73:40 - we want to kind of have a div which is
73:43 - basically going to have all of the text
73:46 - so where it says like the person's name
73:48 - where it says everything else and then
73:49 - we're also going to have a record
73:51 - right so we're also going to have like a
73:52 - record um
73:55 - a record being like that spinning sort
73:57 - of thing that we saw on the bottom right
73:58 - so cause let's go ahead and show them
74:00 - the app and then let's show them sort of
74:01 - what we're
74:02 - trying to get to so they can see a
74:03 - visual comparison
74:05 - so this is the actual app you guys
74:09 - so you see that i'm text right there
74:11 - yeah yep so we want to go from
74:14 - this over here yep
74:17 - to the one on the right exactly
74:22 - cool and right now we're going to work
74:24 - on the footer right sunny

74:29 - to go
74:29 - to this thing here so we need a spinner
74:33 - and a ticker so this is the footer
74:36 - including no actually including the text
74:38 - where it says champagne mommy and the
74:40 - description
74:41 - uh is all of that considered footer
74:44 - yeah so all of that is considered for
74:46 - anything which is attached to the bottom
74:47 - is considered the footer at this point
74:49 - got it okay so all of this let me
74:51 - actually make that very clear because
74:53 - i did not know that yeah by the way dude
74:56 - feel free to correct me because you
74:57 - probably heard me say
74:59 - that as a footer so just feel free to
75:01 - correct me
75:02 - because i think it's at the end it's
75:03 - going to help everybody more just so
75:05 - yeah
75:06 - it's accurate and then steve isn't going
75:07 - to yell at you and everything so it's
75:08 - going to be great

77:23 - or making being able to make one
77:24 - thousand dollar to like
77:26 - how can they like get to the six figure
77:28 - mark as a developer so just
77:30 - lays it out and what does that timeline
77:32 - look like does it look like three months
77:34 - one year
77:34 - four years so all of those things we
77:37 - have because
77:38 - most when it comes to practicality most
77:40 - people don't know how to go from just
77:42 - code typing code to being able to turn
77:45 - that
77:45 - into an income for them and that's why a
77:48 - lot of people
77:49 - quit exactly yeah and guys like that's
77:52 - really where we separate ourselves from
77:54 - like what's currently out there is that
77:56 - we actually go ahead and show you guys
77:58 - not just sort of like the skill set and
77:59 - the coding abilities and all that stuff
78:01 - but also how to go ahead and take it to
78:02 - the next step and make some money from
78:04 - it which is obviously what we're all
78:05 - doing this for we're trying to make some
78:06 - money
78:07 - we're trying to like do our best and
78:09 - become the best developers we can become
78:11 - so that we can go ahead and
78:12 - get a job and become a developer yeah
78:14 - nice
78:15 - and there are many reasons right oh yeah
78:18 - thank you akonch
78:19 - and we got another donation too so thank
78:21 - you guys for that and again guys it's
78:23 - time
78:24 - money and impact right so it's like
78:26 - being a developer allows you to make an
78:28 - impact on the world
78:29 - getting a job allows you to make an
78:30 - impact you also make money which is not
78:33 - bad
78:34 - and that also gives you the freedom to
78:35 - spend more time with your friends family
78:37 - so the practicality
78:39 - you know we don't want to just teach you
78:40 - the coding skills and go okay enjoy
78:42 - how do you turn it into really being
78:45 - able to change your life that's the
78:46 - important key thing
78:47 - there but let's get back to the training
78:50 - exactly
78:51 - yeah so guys what we have now is we have
78:54 - the image
78:55 - right so we have this image and then we
78:57 - also have this
78:58 - uh text right here so the first thing
79:00 - i'm going to do is may actually go ahead
79:01 - and make this
79:02 - h3 and this one is basically going to
79:04 - say for example here it will say
79:06 - rafaeli for example and that would be
79:08 - like the header right so the sort of
79:10 - their handle so in this case it's kazi's
79:12 - handle um so if we go ahead and pop that
79:14 - and you can see now at the bottom in the
79:15 - first says rafikaze right
79:18 - and then what we're going to go ahead
79:19 - and do is have a p tag
79:21 - which is going to have the description
79:22 - right so we're going to go ahead and say
79:24 - this is a description for example right
79:28 - so i'm going to save that and we should
79:30 - see that maybe pop under at this point
79:32 - yes we can
79:32 - we can just about see that pop in there
79:34 - the image right now we can't see because
79:36 - it's kind of like underneath everything
79:37 - right so it's underneath it all right
79:39 - now so to go ahead and fix that just so
79:41 - we can get a clear idea of what's going
79:42 - on now
79:43 - we go to the video footer and i go ahead
79:46 - and make this
79:46 - a display flex um so display
79:50 - flex right so video for display flex
79:54 - um and now what we should see is you can
79:57 - actually see the
79:58 - the sort of it's very hard to tell uh
80:01 - what i'm gonna go ahead and do is style
80:02 - it at this point so we're going to go
80:03 - video footer
80:06 - dot js and i'm going to go ahead and
80:07 - give this image a class name so image of
80:09 - class name of
80:11 - let's say a video footer i'm just going
80:13 - to say
80:14 - logo all right so video for a logo
80:17 - um so like that so one second guys
80:21 - let me go ahead and pop this to the side
80:23 - there we go so we've got video for uh
80:24 - uh right now i'm not gonna call it video
80:26 - for uh logo i'm gonna say video footer
80:28 - record
80:28 - because it's kind of like a record the
80:30 - spinning right so let's go ahead and say
80:32 - video call
80:34 - photo record nice and then what we're
80:36 - going to do is we're actually going to
80:37 - go ahead and target that so i'm going to
80:38 - go ahead and target that
80:40 - and this is what i'm going to do here
80:41 - guys so i'm going to do a few cool
80:42 - things for this video file
80:44 - so firstly what i'm going to say is i'm
80:47 - going to go ahead and
80:48 - add in this follow the following right
80:50 - so
80:52 - i'm going to add this animation in so
80:54 - it's a keyframe animation and it says
80:56 - app logo
80:57 - spin you can actually name this whatever
80:58 - you want so we can call this one
81:00 - spin the record right so let's go ahead
81:03 - and call this one spin the record
81:04 - and what this is basically saying is
81:07 - it's a set of keyframes which is
81:08 - basically like how you define an
81:10 - animation and this is saying go from
81:13 - a transform so a rotation of zero
81:15 - degrees
81:16 - to a rotation of 360 degrees
81:20 - right and this is actually what you
81:21 - actually get by default
81:23 - inside of create react up in that start
81:24 - approach that's why the react logo spins
81:26 - around which is kind of nice right
81:28 - so what we're going to do now is we're
81:29 - going to go ahead and say video footer
81:31 - so video
81:31 - footer underscore under scopes i'm just
81:34 - going to underscore
81:35 - record dope and then here i'm going to
81:38 - say
81:38 - animation and i'm going to go ahead and
81:40 - give it the animation i'm going to say
81:42 - spin the record right spin the record
81:45 - infinite amount so keep spinning it and
81:47 - i want the duration from it to go from
81:49 - zero degrees to 360 degrees
81:51 - in five seconds and i'm going to say
81:53 - linear right which is basically the way
81:55 - it speeds up so
81:56 - i'll go ahead and save that now you i
81:59 - don't think you can
81:59 - actually see it too well but that thing
82:02 - is actually spinning so you can actually
82:03 - see underneath it's kind of spinning but
82:05 - we need to get the size right so at this
82:07 - point i'm going to say height of
82:08 - 50 pixels so i'm going to go ahead and
82:11 - i'm going to say height
82:12 - of 50 pixels and that will make it a
82:15 - hell of a lot smaller so now you can
82:16 - actually see it and it's
82:18 - currently there but it's hard to see so
82:20 - right now because it's black
82:21 - we can actually go ahead and invert it
82:23 - so a very cool trick for you guys is to
82:25 - go here and say
82:26 - filter and say invert one
82:30 - and what this does is it goes ahead and
82:32 - inverts the color so it gets a white
82:33 - color
82:34 - now you can see the whole thing look at
82:35 - that little thing spinning at the bottom
82:36 - that's really nice right
82:39 - so that's really cool and now what we're
82:41 - going to do next is i'm actually going
82:43 - to go ahead and
82:44 - give the text so the text right here
82:48 - so this one right here so if we go to
82:50 - video for uh remember all of this text
82:51 - so roughly causes this description
82:53 - i'm gonna go ahead and target that and
82:56 - say
82:57 - go ahead and target that and say
83:00 - i'm gonna make it flex one now flex one
83:02 - is gonna set the weight
83:03 - so it's gonna say that text description
83:05 - box where it's got raphael causes this
83:07 - description
83:08 - that should take up precedence which
83:09 - means as soon as i hit save here yo just
83:11 - real quick sunny where did you get to
83:13 - spin the record
83:14 - is that a library or part of like the
83:16 - animation that comes with it what is
83:17 - that
83:18 - no so that's the that's part that's ah
83:20 - okay got it got it got it you created
83:22 - the
83:22 - css animation okay dope nice zero
83:25 - degrees to 360 degrees oh that is
83:27 - very clean nice right yeah very clean
83:31 - and what's up with invert the imba is uh
83:35 - whether it's going clockwise or
83:36 - counterclockwise that's what it is
83:40 - this is the color yeah what's the color
83:42 - normally so it's normally black
83:44 - right okay i couldn't actually get like
83:46 - a white png with like that with a
83:49 - see-through okay super that's a clean
83:51 - solution that is very nice
83:53 - yeah so i just invited the color which
83:55 - is nice um
83:56 - and then if we go ahead and save that so
83:58 - now you can see it gave flex1 to that
84:00 - text box so which is why
84:01 - it just pushed it away so it pushed it
84:03 - to the sides which is really clean like
84:05 - it looks really nice like that
84:06 - um so let's go ahead and check out the
84:10 - finished one so
84:11 - nice so what i'm going to do now is i'm
84:12 - going to actually go ahead and give the
84:14 - um give that a bit of padding because
84:17 - right now it looks kind of squashed up
84:18 - right it looks a bit squashed up there
84:20 - so
84:20 - i'm going to go ahead and say the video
84:22 - foot uh record so video footer
84:25 - i'm going to say position zero color
84:28 - white so
84:29 - that's no we don't need that one i'm
84:31 - going to go ahead and space this a bit
84:33 - nicer now so
84:35 - what we're going to do now is go ahead
84:37 - and give the video for a text
84:38 - and the five second in the animation
84:40 - gerardo asks what does that mean
84:42 - it means five seconds so it's five
84:45 - seconds to go from
84:46 - zero five seconds to zero to 360 right
84:49 - yeah yeah to go from zero to 360. and
84:52 - then because it says
84:53 - infinite it basically just loops so even
84:56 - when it finishes it just carries on
84:57 - doing it right
84:58 - so now if i save that we should see a
85:01 - padding around it okay so that's not
85:02 - what we wanted one second
85:04 - um we don't want to do a padding around
85:06 - this sorry
85:07 - i'm going to do a padding around the
85:08 - video footer so padding
85:11 - and here what i'm going to do is i'm
85:12 - going to say padding
85:14 - and i'm going to do 20 pixels
85:19 - there we go nice and that should
85:21 - actually go ahead and comment by
85:22 - vabov and he says learned firebase from
85:26 - you
85:27 - and used it in one of my projects rather
85:29 - than mongodb
85:30 - it was amazing great work guys hey
85:33 - love that nice that's what it's about
85:36 - guys yeah so once you actually use
85:37 - firebase you're going to really see the
85:38 - beauty and
85:39 - then the sort of value in it guys so
85:41 - really really nice stuff
85:43 - so what i'm going to do now is actually
85:45 - go ahead and change this
85:47 - um oh i see i did it slightly different
85:50 - before okay so what i'm going to do now
85:52 - guys actually we will use flex yeah
85:53 - because flex is a really nice solution
85:55 - to this
85:56 - um nice so i'm going to go ahead and do
85:58 - now is say bottom
86:00 - 50 pixels up okay awesome um and what
86:03 - we're going to do is go ahead and add
86:04 - that
86:05 - that sort of um the next
86:08 - element which is the sticker
86:11 - right so that little spinning sort of
86:12 - that thing that which kind of flies
86:14 - across
86:14 - so the first step is we need the music
86:16 - now icon and we need a bunch of icons
86:17 - throughout this project so
86:19 - let's go ahead and install material ui
86:21 - fuzzy
86:24 - let's do it so okay let me
86:27 - let's open up the command line and let's
86:29 - also go to material ui
86:31 - right here and so install it guys we are
86:34 - going to need this one line over here
86:36 - npm install i'm going to open up a new
86:39 - terminal
86:40 - yep and i'm just going to cd and not
86:44 - not even though that's not necessary but
86:46 - i'm just going to do it anyway
86:48 - and we're going to install the material
86:50 - ui core and
86:51 - that's one thing we're going to need the
86:53 - second thing we're going to need guys is
86:54 - go ahead and make your screen full size
86:57 - and go to icons now once you're in icons
87:01 - you're going to need to also
87:02 - install the icons because we need them
87:03 - right sunny for
87:05 - yeah right all this hard sign that you
87:08 - guys are going to build
87:09 - the comments for all of this stuff
87:11 - you're going to need that
87:12 - so let's go back here and we're going to
87:15 - just
87:16 - right click it and i'm going to put it
87:19 - here
87:20 - and i can actually open up another uh
87:24 - new terminal and i can just paste it
87:26 - there
87:28 - so that will install the icons
87:31 - yeah and one thing i want to show you
87:32 - guys with the icons
87:34 - is you can just click the search full
87:36 - list of icons and
87:38 - here are damn i remember all of this
87:41 - stuff
87:43 - i did it's so nice like going cause you
87:46 - take it away
87:47 - yeah and here are all the nice icons you
87:50 - guys have for material ui so whether
87:53 - you know you guys want to have um so if
87:56 - i look at this app here
87:57 - i'm gonna just type in heart i even have
87:59 - i haven't even done this sonny done this
88:02 - but like i'll just type in heart and see
88:03 - what i get back and i imagine he's using
88:06 - this one called favorite border
88:08 - so that's the heart and for comments i'm
88:12 - gonna just type in comment and let's see
88:14 - what i get
88:14 - so i feel like sunny is using chat
88:18 - for that one so if i look boom
88:21 - that's the one and then we're probably
88:22 - gonna need another one
88:24 - share which is i think sunny's just
88:25 - using this one and exactly
88:28 - right there so that's the use of
88:30 - material ui you guys
88:32 - yes and love that love that explanation
88:35 - guys and that's the truth so whenever
88:36 - you see us importing something
88:38 - if you go ahead and click on one of
88:39 - those things it actually gives you the
88:41 - line of code
88:42 - that you uh that you need to import
88:44 - inside so if we go ahead and click on
88:45 - like uh the heart for example
88:47 - it will say import and you can pretty
88:49 - much just copy that in and use that as
88:51 - a uh as a import and then you can pretty
88:54 - much you render that on the screen which
88:55 - is really clean
88:56 - right yeah awesome so the one we need is
89:00 - something called a music note icon so
89:01 - i've got it here so i'm going to go
89:03 - ahead and pop that in here so it's music
89:05 - note icon
89:06 - and what that is is essentially where we
89:08 - have the ticker so i'm just going to pop
89:10 - it on the screen for now so we can just
89:11 - have a look at it
89:12 - so if i go ahead and chuck that in we
89:15 - should see that actually pop in the
89:16 - screen
89:17 - at any point so let's go ahead and save
89:24 - wait a sec is it loading okay so it's
89:27 - actually kind of pushed underneath a
89:28 - little bit now
89:29 - so what i'm going to go ahead and do is
89:30 - go to the video footer and make it a
89:32 - little bit further out from the bottom
89:34 - so let's do 100 pixels from the bottom
89:36 - and this this should push it up there we
89:38 - go nice okay so i'm gonna go ahead and
89:40 - do that
89:42 - and uh what we can then do and say is
89:44 - actually go ahead
89:45 - hold on have it hold on hold on hold on
89:48 - are we
89:50 - are we following you uh
89:53 - yeah i think so i think so i think so
89:56 - okay keep going keep going
89:57 - let's just have the app open up on the
89:59 - on the right
90:00 - yep there we go nice okay
90:03 - cool all right so we pushed it up a
90:05 - little bit we have that little icon
90:06 - right
90:07 - so the next thing i guess that we need
90:08 - is that little ticker right so we're
90:10 - going to use something
90:11 - called react ticker so it's a library
90:14 - that someone else has built it's called
90:15 - react ticker
90:16 - so i'm going to go ahead and install
90:17 - that so i'm going to say npm uh oh
90:20 - i can't need request read alright so
90:23 - there we go hold on so when you're doing
90:24 - it make sure we can all see it because
90:26 - right now we can't see it
90:27 - so yeah i will switch to these i think
90:31 - you're on
90:31 - probably the second one type i was on
90:34 - this
90:35 - you might be on the third one yeah i was
90:37 - on the third one yeah so
90:38 - i don't see you typing anywhere so it's
90:41 - the third one third one though
90:42 - type i see you yep so now it's cd so we
90:45 - need to cd firstly to make sure we're in
90:47 - the right folder and then we're going to
90:48 - do npm
90:49 - install and then i'm going to do a react
90:52 - ticker
90:53 - right and this is going to go ahead and
90:54 - bring in the code that someone else has
90:56 - made
90:56 - and to use it guys once that's already
90:59 - now once that's installed i just go to
91:00 - the top and say import ticker
91:02 - from react ticker right and the way we
91:04 - actually go ahead and use this
91:06 - is it has something called render props
91:08 - which are really cool and the way we do
91:09 - that is we pretty much we put out the
91:11 - react ticker
91:12 - oh why is it doing that and what this
91:13 - it's got this neat little attribute
91:15 - here called mode is smooth and i'll show
91:17 - you what that does in a sec
91:19 - and basically what are render props
91:21 - right so render props are basically
91:22 - something which tell us like
91:24 - it gives us some information by by
91:27 - having this component here we can
91:28 - actually go ahead and get the index
91:30 - so in this case we don't actually use
91:32 - the index but i'll show you because it's
91:33 - quite a cool demonstration as to what is
91:35 - happening here
91:36 - so if i go ahead and paste this in so
91:38 - what are we trying to achieve right now
91:40 - the ticker so got it yeah so if i as
91:43 - soon as i hit save now
91:45 - so the song is not file yeah so here for
91:47 - example if i say
91:48 - uh yo what's up guys yo what's
91:52 - up guys and i save now check this out
91:57 - so if i save this we will actually go
91:59 - ahead and have a ticker
92:01 - at the bottom of the screen so you see
92:02 - that it says yo what's up guys yeah
92:05 - yeah so it says yo what's up guys and
92:07 - then basically this the mode
92:09 - smooth the reason why we need this is if
92:11 - you get rid of this is mode smooth
92:13 - basically says stop
92:14 - showing the next piece of text when the
92:16 - other one starts disappearing so you get
92:17 - a nice transition but if i get rid of
92:19 - that oh
92:19 - nice yeah it kind of does it like that
92:22 - so they have
92:23 - already accounted for that and then
92:24 - whoever built this done a good job of
92:25 - making it
92:26 - very easy to implement so the index by
92:28 - the way is also
92:30 - if you ever want to keep track of which
92:32 - number is
92:33 - showing it then what you can do is you
92:35 - can actually say this so you can put the
92:36 - index in
92:37 - and now it will say let's go ahead and
92:39 - see us here say what's up guys xero
92:41 - and i'll say yo what's up guys one yo
92:44 - what's up guys two
92:45 - yo what's up guys street so that's an
92:47 - example of something called a render
92:48 - prop
92:49 - uh which a lot of libraries actually
92:50 - give you oh wait hold on it's
92:53 - how is it incrementing
92:56 - yeah so they've done that on their end
92:58 - so they built some functionality inside
93:00 - of there
93:01 - um and you can actually go ahead and
93:02 - pull out
93:04 - yeah it's really cool right damn
93:07 - so infinite like as long as they keep
93:09 - zoning i'll just keep incrementing it
93:11 - yeah just keep incrementing it yeah nice
93:14 - wow okay nice
93:15 - miguel nicholas says this is
93:16 - pre-recorded right no this is live dude
93:19 - this is live we're live right now
93:22 - yeah this is live right now nice um
93:25 - awesome so and now what we're going to
93:27 - do is i'm going to change that because
93:28 - we don't want it to essentially be
93:30 - this huge thing so let's go ahead and
93:31 - make that p tag so
93:33 - let's do p and i just save it
93:36 - like this and now i should say yo what's
93:39 - up guys in a smaller way which is kind
93:40 - of already cleaner right nice that is
93:42 - looking clean
93:44 - yeah so we need to kind of solve this or
93:47 - make it look a bit closer to the final
93:49 - result right the final end product so
93:51 - let's go ahead and start styling this so
93:53 - firstly do we need to give any more
93:55 - sort of css class names uh i think let's
93:58 - go ahead and give
93:59 - the this outside container so right now
94:02 - we've got the music now icon and the
94:04 - ticker
94:04 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
94:05 - chuck that inside of a container i'm
94:07 - going to give it a class name of a video
94:09 - footer so here class name a video for a
94:11 - ticker
94:12 - and i'm going to click enter there we go
94:15 - i'm going to chuck
94:16 - this stuff inside of its own container
94:18 - because i want to style this stuff right
94:19 - i want to have the music note icon next
94:21 - to the ticker
94:22 - so i want to kind of have them next to
94:23 - each other so as soon as i do that
94:26 - as soon as i do that we should be able
94:28 - to see that like
94:29 - not much visual change there because
94:31 - this we're using block right but what i
94:32 - can do now is i'm going to also give the
94:34 - music note icon
94:36 - a class name because i want to style
94:37 - that as well so i'm going to go ahead
94:39 - and say
94:39 - give that a class name a video footer
94:41 - icon so i'm going to go here to music
94:43 - now icon and say
94:45 - boom video footage icon there we go
94:48 - now if we go back to the video for a
94:51 - ticket inside of our css file
94:52 - i can actually style it right so for
94:54 - that video for a ticker
94:56 - what i'm going to say is i'm going to
94:58 - say the
95:01 - the text i want it to be so the text
95:04 - inside of that ticker container so i'm
95:07 - going to say target the p
95:08 - text and i'm going to say
95:11 - here i want the uh the text to be um
95:15 - font size of 12 pixels and a padding of
95:17 - seven pixels above it so
95:19 - if i do that and save it
95:22 - so that's a bit too small at the moment
95:24 - actually i think what we had is actually
95:25 - pretty good
95:26 - maybe so it's actually kind of nice uh
95:28 - we have it at the moment
95:29 - so if we go ahead and get rid of that it
95:30 - was actually kind of cool how we have it
95:32 - right now so that's pretty good
95:33 - um but for the for
95:36 - the um what am i trying to do here so
95:39 - we've got the video for a record we've
95:42 - got the h3 we've got so firstly let's go
95:43 - ahead and style
95:44 - the text a little bit more so we had
95:48 - the uh where it said where it says
95:50 - rafaeli that's kind of bunched up at the
95:52 - moment right
95:53 - yeah so right now i'm going to go ahead
95:54 - and target that it's a video for a text
95:57 - the h3 inside of it which is this one
95:59 - yep
96:00 - yeah we're going to target you know a
96:01 - lot of a lot of people are saying you
96:03 - know they're a bunch of people
96:04 - at least one person in the chat he's
96:06 - like angular
96:07 - you guys give respect to angular you
96:09 - know what are you guys doing just
96:11 - talking about react
96:12 - but here's what i have to say to that
96:13 - here's what it feels like
96:16 - when you uh you know can code with react
96:19 - and make stuff work
96:20 - so i'm just going to pop it up so
96:22 - everybody can actually take a look at it
96:28 - here's like here's what it feels like
96:29 - guys when you make when you make [ __ ]
96:31 - work and react so
96:33 - that's why we're gonna code and react
96:34 - guys no angular here
96:36 - get out of here with that [ __ ] let's go
96:38 - [Laughter]
96:41 - oh man gurnaratha says keep going guys
96:46 - thank you yeah and honestly guys i see
96:48 - so many comments about angular
96:50 - like guys if you check the market share
96:52 - right now why why are you guys
96:53 - interested in angular react is literally
96:55 - on fire
96:56 - like in terms of it's literally so
96:59 - opinionated and
97:01 - traps you into that framework react this
97:04 - like javascript at the end of the day
97:06 - and it's just a library um
97:09 - exactly it's just a it's this massive
97:11 - framework it's very hard to get it sort
97:13 - of started like
97:14 - honestly guys like react is the way to
97:16 - go react is the way to go it's going to
97:18 - save you a bunch of
97:19 - like time and effort you're going to
97:20 - actually get a big payoff from react
97:22 - nice seriously so we've added a bit of
97:26 - padding and what we need to do is every
97:28 - time we do this i'm just going to go
97:29 - ahead and pull this a little bit higher
97:30 - so it kind of
97:31 - gets a bit sort of doesn't get squashed
97:33 - to the bottom there we go
97:35 - um and what i'm going to do is give it
97:37 - so make it a little bit lower so let's
97:38 - go ahead and do 150
97:40 - to the bottom and see how that looks
97:43 - okay it looks a bit better i'm going to
97:45 - go ahead and give this a margin left of
97:46 - 40 pixels so i don't want it to touch
97:48 - the side
97:49 - so margin left to 40 pixels and let's
97:51 - see what that does
97:53 - uh nice so that's already looking a bit
97:55 - cleaner
97:56 - where we had the video footer so this
97:59 - one here guys where we had the video for
98:01 - a ticker
98:02 - i'm gonna go ahead and set that to a
98:04 - display flex
98:05 - so video footer ticker and say to set
98:08 - that to
98:09 - display flex right
98:12 - so as soon as i do that that should
98:15 - snap the okay i remember now yeah so
98:18 - guys
98:19 - this is actually a bit interesting right
98:20 - so usually this would work
98:22 - right usually this work but the library
98:24 - the way they built this is a bit
98:25 - uh it's a bit like tricky so i had to
98:28 - kind of come up with a hackier approach
98:30 - of getting this one to work right
98:31 - so what we did is because whenever you
98:34 - do uh display flex on it it kind of
98:36 - freaks out
98:36 - it freaks out a little bit uh for that
98:39 - sort of uh the ticker that they've built
98:41 - so the way i got around this is for the
98:42 - icon i made it position absolute so that
98:45 - little music icon
98:46 - i made this position absolute so if i go
98:48 - ahead and add that line here so
98:51 - position absolute and save it you're
98:53 - going to see
98:54 - it will go ahead and it will actually
98:55 - sort of snap up so now they're next to
98:57 - each other right but
98:58 - the text goes through it right so the
99:00 - text goes
99:02 - through that music emoji right or music
99:04 - icon sorry
99:05 - oh thank you very much for the super
99:06 - chat really nice
99:08 - uh appreciate that dude and then what
99:10 - we're gonna do is
99:11 - i'm gonna go ahead and target the ticker
99:14 - right so the tick i
99:15 - inspected and i saw they give it a class
99:17 - name of ticker so what i'm gonna do now
99:19 - is i'm gonna say
99:20 - um video for a ticker go ahead and
99:23 - target the inner ticker and say
99:24 - firstly the height should fit the
99:26 - content the margin
99:28 - left should be 30 pixels and the width
99:30 - should be 60 pixels
99:31 - so margin left it should give us enough
99:33 - room so it doesn't actually go ahead and
99:35 - touch
99:36 - the uh the ticker so now what we can see
99:39 - is
99:41 - the ticker actually sort of stops before
99:43 - that low the icon now
99:45 - see that so it kind of stops before the
99:47 - icon which is really nice it's like a
99:49 - bit cleaner
99:50 - um but what i'm going to do is i'm going
99:51 - to give that that ticker text
99:54 - a little bit of a padding at the top of
99:56 - it so it kind of aligns a bit nicer so
99:57 - i'm going to say padding
99:59 - uh seven pixels at the top so let's go
100:02 - ahead and do that seven pixels at the
100:03 - top
100:04 - and we save it and now
100:09 - there we go so now what we have there is
100:12 - very clean it's very nice
100:13 - the description is the last bit there
100:15 - which kind of looks a bit off
100:16 - so let's go ahead and save that
100:18 - description so
100:21 - because that needs to have a bit of a
100:22 - bit more padding to it so
100:24 - we need to give it a padding bottom of
100:26 - 20 pixels
100:27 - so i'm going to go ahead and say inside
100:30 - the text
100:31 - container target the part of the p tag
100:33 - and give it a padding bomb
100:35 - 20 pixels so if i do that now it should
100:37 - push it a bit down so you can see like
100:39 - those little tweaks and already you've
100:40 - got like a much nicer looking sort of
100:42 - app right
100:43 - uh the only thing to fix here is that
100:46 - spinner icon right
100:47 - so the spinner right now what we can do
100:48 - is because we're inside of a
100:50 - relatively positioned container you can
100:53 - do it you can actually go ahead and do a
100:54 - little hack here
100:55 - right so to get this one to work really
100:57 - nicely
100:59 - you can go ahead and actually sort of
101:00 - rather than messing around too much with
101:02 - the flexbox tricks
101:03 - you can say go and target that record
101:05 - and you can go say
101:07 - the position make it position absolute
101:09 - right position
101:11 - absolute and as soon as i do this you'll
101:14 - see it would break it and it's going to
101:15 - kind of fly over to i think the left it
101:18 - might yep so it flies over to the left
101:19 - right because
101:19 - it's kind of sitting on top it's saying
101:21 - no absolutely position me
101:23 - so right now what i'm gonna say i'm
101:24 - gonna say bottom should be zero
101:27 - so the bottom should be zero and then
101:29 - this will kind of snap it to the bottom
101:30 - of that
101:31 - container and then i'm going to say
101:33 - right
101:34 - zero and this is why setting the parent
101:38 - to position relative
101:39 - is very important so setting the parent
101:41 - position relative is very important
101:42 - because now it knows
101:43 - where to be relative to in terms of
101:45 - being absolutely positioned so now you
101:47 - can see
101:47 - it's snapped to the right right but we
101:50 - we kind of we don't want it to go all
101:52 - the way to the right so i'm going to say
101:53 - 20 pixels from the right so 20 pixels
101:56 - from the right is good
101:58 - so if i go ahead and do that boom now
102:01 - you've got like the exact positioning
102:02 - that we wanted
102:03 - and look everything is in its place
102:05 - everything is where it should be
102:07 - um so and now what we're gonna do is we
102:10 - are gonna basically i think that's
102:11 - actually the video footer done dude
102:14 - i think oh guys yeah the video looks
102:16 - pretty clean
102:20 - [Music]
102:22 - that's sick i just threw some horn
102:24 - sounds the video
102:26 - is done let's go guys i think you just
102:28 - gotta deal with it
102:29 - uh at this point
102:36 - i think we should keep them coming
102:38 - that's my dude hey guys who's enjoying
102:40 - that [ __ ] that i'm dropping you know
102:41 - comment below so we can keep the
102:44 - you know i'm the i'm the jeff dj so
102:47 - let me know i'll keep it coming exactly
102:51 - now where we render that video for we
102:55 - want the video for it to be customizable
102:56 - right we want to be customizable um we
102:59 - want it to be able to take some kind of
103:00 - props so what i'm going to do now
103:02 - is i'm going to make the video for
103:04 - except a bunch of props so here
103:06 - is where we we usually define props so
103:08 - i'm going to destructure at this point
103:09 - and
103:10 - say the video footage should take a
103:12 - channel prop
103:13 - should take a description prop and it
103:15 - should take in a song
103:17 - right so in this case what we're going
103:20 - to do is we have
103:21 - the at and then i'm going to basically
103:22 - go ahead and pop the channel in here
103:25 - right so it should say at whatever we
103:27 - passed in as a channel
103:28 - then here i'm going to replace rather
103:30 - than saying this is a description
103:32 - and place this with a description prop
103:34 - so you now you can see on the right it's
103:36 - actually coming up with nothing because
103:37 - we're not passing in those props
103:39 - and here even for the song what i'm
103:41 - going to say is
103:42 - let's go ahead and pop in
103:45 - my song here so there we go so now we're
103:47 - passing in those props so what we can do
103:49 - is what we call it
103:51 - what we can say is the video for here we
103:52 - can say channel
103:54 - equals let's just say rafikaze so rafe
103:58 - kazi and then here we can say
104:00 - description
104:02 - is actually going to be let's just go
104:04 - say um check out this dance for example
104:07 - check out this
104:08 - oh this dance yeah and then it's gonna
104:12 - be
104:13 - um the uh song let's just say
104:16 - i don't know what the song is in this
104:18 - one but let's just go ahead and say
104:19 - something like
104:20 - let's just say sunny yeah yeah
104:23 - what are we working on so now we're
104:25 - working on
104:26 - we actually put in the props so for a
104:29 - video for we just gave it some props so
104:31 - now
104:32 - if you see it takes a channel a
104:33 - description and a song
104:36 - right and what happens is that gets
104:38 - passed into the video footer
104:40 - here as the props and then we use them
104:43 - here so that's how we can make this
104:45 - reusable now so every time i call video
104:47 - footer
104:48 - i can just pass in props and it renders
104:49 - it in the correct way cool so i just
104:51 - said working on displaying songs at the
104:53 - bottom
104:55 - um we just did that one now we finished
104:57 - that oh nice okay okay beautiful nice
105:02 - um so the next step is we want to so
105:05 - we've got the video
105:06 - sidebar uh i think yeah yes we're on the
105:08 - video side by now awesome
105:09 - nice okay so video sidebar just to make
105:12 - it
105:12 - super clear guys is actually that
105:15 - sidebar with the icons on
105:17 - comment and share i wrote it at the top
105:19 - as well and it's gonna be this one over
105:22 - here guys the sidebar
105:24 - with a heart comment and share that
105:27 - exactly so remember we actually gave it
105:30 - a little outline
105:31 - over here so we said like we've done a
105:33 - little comment draft
105:34 - so what i'm going to go ahead and do is
105:36 - do a video sidebar so video outside
105:41 - the jeff god now hey
105:44 - nice gift card uh are you guys working
105:47 - on ui or back end as well so we are we
105:49 - will be working on a
105:51 - sort of a firebase back end so keep
105:52 - tuned and smash the thumbs up if you're
105:54 - excited for that
105:55 - so we're going to create a file called
105:58 - video sidebar which is going to be for
106:00 - the
106:00 - sidebar component so vsibo.js
106:04 - and now when i'm inside of here i'm
106:06 - going to use
106:07 - rfce our lovely little extension trick
106:11 - boom and then we get this and now here
106:13 - i'm going to say a h2 and i'm just going
106:15 - to say i am a sidebar oh god i wasn't
106:17 - doing that i'll say
106:19 - i am a sidebar okay
106:22 - nice and then we need to basically go
106:24 - ahead and
106:25 - get rid of our little draft and we're
106:26 - going to import that so video cyber
106:30 - i'm going to say import video sidebar
106:33 - from video sidebar
106:36 - and save and now what that will do
106:40 - is it will actually it should come
106:44 - underneath it but i don't know if we're
106:45 - going to see it okay so we're not going
106:46 - to see it yet because remember the way
106:48 - we position things around it's not too
106:49 - clear so
106:50 - at this point don't lose faith guys all
106:53 - right you just kind of have to trust the
106:54 - process
106:55 - don't lose faith and remember guys that
106:58 - respect the sidebar
106:59 - okay that's what we're gonna be building
107:02 - i was like i was like i did not expect
107:04 - that
107:06 - did you create that one
107:09 - it's a little bit of a secret you know
107:11 - you guys keep going
107:15 - we're going to import the the css
107:19 - so now it's a video sidebar.css
107:22 - video sidebar.css boom
107:26 - and i'm going to go ahead and do a video
107:28 - sidebar.here so i'm going to make that
107:30 - file video cybercss and we should pop
107:32 - into it in a sec
107:34 - boom there we go so i'm now inside video
107:36 - about sidebar css
107:37 - so now what i'm going to do guys is i'm
107:39 - going to target that
107:41 - and i'm going to give it a special kind
107:44 - of positioning right so i'm going to say
107:46 - do position absolute so position
107:49 - absolute
107:50 - absolute and i'm going to say from the
107:53 - top of the screen go 50 percent down
107:56 - right so let's try that out let's say
107:57 - from the 50 down i'm going to go ahead
107:59 - and save that going to go ahead and save
108:00 - that
108:01 - and let's see if we can actually go
108:02 - ahead and see that so video cyber.css
108:05 - so right now it says i am a sidebar you
108:08 - see that on the left side of the screen
108:10 - right um oh nice nitesh kumar just
108:14 - donated he said please explain course
108:16 - content you provide on the website
108:21 - crazy i think you're muted maybe
108:24 - i'm muted yeah because i was talking
108:26 - actually for a second my bad guys
108:28 - so um who do who donated because i don't
108:30 - see them
108:32 - natash kumar oh i see okay
108:35 - so um by the way the link is in the
108:37 - description we don't want to spend too
108:39 - much time on this because we just want
108:40 - to make sure we provide you guys value
108:42 - and we build
108:43 - um you know the course the app here for
108:46 - you guys but
108:47 - the course content guys it's going to be
108:49 - 15 modules that you guys
108:51 - have in the course on javascript
108:53 - training and if you watch that video
108:55 - that we have for you so this video if
108:57 - you watch it that'll pretty much explain
108:59 - everything
109:00 - so you want to become a javascript
109:02 - developer
109:03 - here yeah so if you watch that video
109:05 - it's going to explain pretty much
109:07 - everything that's covered in the program
109:09 - so you're building real world projects
109:10 - and we teach how to make an income so
109:13 - that's what that is nice exactly guys
109:16 - link in the description go and check it
109:18 - out yeah awesome
109:20 - um so yeah you can see now that the
109:22 - sidebar is actually popping in on the
109:23 - left so it says i am a sidebar
109:25 - but that's not really the right position
109:27 - we want to be it needs to be and so
109:29 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to go
109:31 - ahead and say
109:33 - that it needs to be um right so let's go
109:36 - ahead and make it right
109:38 - so video sidebar i'm going to say right
109:42 - 10 pixels right so 10 pixels to uh and
109:45 - basically if i gave it a 0 it would snap
109:47 - all the way but
109:47 - that's why it's got that tiny gap so you
109:49 - can see it's very faint it's very
109:51 - hard to see at the moment basically give
109:52 - it a color of white
109:54 - so color of white and you should see a
109:57 - bit more clearer
109:58 - um because of this
110:04 - right so now we should see um
110:07 - it says i'm a cyborg so we're going to
110:09 - basically transform that into the
110:10 - finished product that we had earlier so
110:12 - video sidebar dot js
110:15 - now what i'm going to go ahead and do is
110:16 - pop into video cyberjs nice
110:19 - and we're basically going to we so
110:20 - there's a bunch of icons that we need so
110:22 - i'm going to basically go ahead and
110:23 - import them
110:24 - all at once at the top so it saves us a
110:26 - bit of time so we're going to have that
110:27 - at the top
110:28 - import favorite icon the favorite border
110:31 - icon so these two
110:33 - are variations for when we like it and
110:35 - when we unlike it
110:36 - the message icon and the share icon
110:38 - right so we talked about those earlier
110:40 - um and what we're going to do now is i'm
110:42 - basically going to go ahead
110:44 - and pop all of those icons
110:48 - inside of so each icon you know is how a
110:51 - sort of um it had a sort of structure to
110:53 - it i had the icon and then it had a
110:54 - number
110:55 - which was corresponding to how many
110:57 - people had liked it how many people had
110:58 - commented how many people had shared it
111:00 - so this is a little trick for you guys
111:02 - it's sort of a good standard to follow
111:04 - whenever you have that kind of situation
111:06 - make a div all right make a div and
111:08 - hopefully in this case make it like
111:09 - video sidebar
111:11 - and have underscore underscore selection
111:14 - so in this case it's going to be like a
111:15 - selection or you can call it something
111:17 - else
111:19 - you can call it whatever you want at
111:20 - this point like but in this case i'm
111:21 - gonna say it's a sidebar selection right
111:23 - so here so sidebar selection oh let's
111:26 - just call it sidebar option
111:27 - options a bit clearer sidebar option or
111:29 - sidebar
111:30 - button there say sidebar button
111:34 - just go ahead and call it sidebar button
111:36 - right
111:37 - so now what we're going to do is we have
111:39 - the sidebar button
111:41 - and we are going to basically have it so
111:44 - that we have the three icons
111:46 - uh oh that's not cyber cyber
111:49 - that's it so the first one is going to
111:51 - be a favorite icon
111:53 - so here i'm going to do favorite icon
111:55 - favorite icon there we go
111:57 - and then i'm basically each one the
111:59 - reason why i want it like this is
112:00 - because imagine we had the icon
112:02 - and then i'm going to have a
112:02 - corresponding p tag which says how many
112:05 - so in this case let's have like 300
112:07 - likes
112:08 - quick i just want to say guys thank you
112:10 - so much we just broke
112:12 - 20 000 views holy crap
112:16 - you guys are brilliant and i think this
112:19 - is also a good point to just be like
112:21 - guys
112:22 - we are what one hour 52 minutes in two
112:25 - hours this is where the
112:27 - energy starts to go down this is what's
112:29 - going to make the difference between you
112:30 - actually retaining this information
112:32 - versus losing it and kind of just like
112:35 - like watching it's like a derpy state so
112:39 - get out of that derpy said that happens
112:40 - right sunny
112:41 - it happens with you probably when you're
112:42 - watching long movies there's like this
112:44 - dude
112:44 - that happens when i'm coding even so
112:46 - like you do need to like kind of like
112:48 - sort of like flex out stand
112:49 - up shake off you could flex out or grit
112:52 - out whichever way you want
112:53 - yeah literally you've got that make sure
112:55 - you just get up at this point
112:57 - kind of just shake off like give you
112:58 - just wake yourself up a little bit
113:00 - and then kind of just carry on because
113:02 - we're almost young guys so
113:03 - yeah this is like finished this is what
113:05 - i recommend go get your perrier
113:07 - go get your coffee if you need to and
113:10 - just be pumped like honestly

113:33 - we're ready to kick ass so with that
113:35 - said if you guys are ready
113:37 - let's get back into it and in the chat
113:39 - below just tell us
113:40 - if you're pumped and you're ready to go
113:42 - and finish this app because we're
113:43 - getting to the close
113:45 - drop that in the comments below and
113:46 - let's keep it moving awesome let's do it
113:49 - let's do it so remember guys we had that
113:52 - that div around the icon and the p tag
113:55 - so what i'm going to do now is i'm going
113:56 - to make it life a bit simple i'm just
113:58 - going to paste it paste it again
114:00 - so now if i save it we'll see three hot
114:02 - icons with
114:03 - 300 underneath them so awesome so
114:07 - they're kind of bunched together right
114:08 - now
114:09 - but i'm going to go ahead and change
114:10 - those so this one's going to be the
114:11 - message icon so
114:12 - the message icon so let's go ahead and
114:15 - pop down here and this one's going to be
114:16 - the share icon so
114:18 - share icon here nice and then what we're
114:20 - going to do is change these numbers up
114:21 - so here i have like 230 and
114:23 - here i'll have like let's just say like
114:25 - 10 shares because the shares are usually
114:27 - less
114:28 - all right now as soon as i do that you
114:29 - can see the icons have changed but the
114:31 - spacing is not correct
114:32 - right the spacing isn't correct so what
114:35 - we're going to do
114:36 - is go ahead and do it
114:39 - as it's a video about our side selection
114:42 - so
114:42 - now what i'm going to do is go and
114:45 - target that
114:46 - that button so that that sort of
114:47 - container with the button inside of it
114:49 - i'm gonna say give it a padding
114:50 - of 20 pixels so first let's see what
114:52 - that does so let's give it a padding of
114:54 - 20 pixels and you can see
114:55 - whoa look at that one simple change and
114:58 - it just made everything a little bit
114:59 - cleaner all right
115:00 - one simple change in it so i'll give
115:01 - everything that's how a nice finished
115:03 - kind of look right
115:05 - and then what we're going to do is we're
115:06 - going to say text text align what did i
115:08 - miss
115:09 - show me so i will show you now so what
115:12 - i'm going to do is i'm going to
115:13 - uncomment these two yeah so literally
115:16 - these two lines look how much of a
115:17 - difference they make
115:18 - so that's sort of um i don't i didn't
115:20 - see anything bro
115:22 - you're lying to the map i see
115:25 - yeah all bunched together but i gave it
115:28 - i basically put the number and the icon
115:30 - in the container
115:31 - and then i done that for all three and
115:33 - then i basically gave each one
115:34 - 20 pixels padding and boom
115:39 - nice that is clean i love the simplicity
115:42 - of some of these solutions
115:44 - because i know a lot of people including
115:46 - myself like i would just
115:48 - have so many things achieving
115:51 - maybe the same thing but they're so much
115:53 - more likely to break because they're
115:54 - just like
115:55 - overly like complicated so this is nice
115:57 - how simple this is
115:59 - exactly and like what i used to do when
116:01 - i was learning and stuff in the
116:02 - beginning was
116:03 - i used to kind of do all these views and
116:05 - like these different css
116:07 - rules and stuff and it used to kind of
116:08 - get a bit haywire and you're like whoa
116:09 - yeah
116:10 - i have like 10 different rules and i
116:11 - really don't know which one but i'm
116:12 - scared to touch anything
116:14 - yeah um so when you get to that stage
116:16 - just take your time to kind of learn the
116:18 - little bits and bobs like so that you
116:20 - kind of
116:20 - you only have to give one rule and it
116:22 - basically fixes everything you know
116:24 - that's what i'd recommend so
116:28 - what we're going to do now is actually
116:29 - go ahead and uh
116:31 - we finished with the styling there but
116:33 - we kind of want that like functionality
116:35 - right we want it so that
116:36 - when i hit that like button it basically
116:38 - unlikes it and it likes it etc so
116:41 - you guessed it we're going to be using a
116:42 - piece of state so we're going to have a
116:44 - piece of state and it's going to say
116:45 - liked so i think steve will be happy
116:48 - with this one and says liked
116:49 - and liked to be true or false right or
116:52 - like has liked
116:53 - something like he's going to
117:00 - and then you stay and then here we're
117:01 - going to say
117:03 - like i know like in in a production app
117:05 - they could have liked it before but in
117:06 - our demo app we're going to pretty much
117:08 - say that they haven't liked it before
117:09 - right
117:10 - so when you come onto the page they're
117:11 - not going to have liked it so what we're
117:13 - going to do first is i'm going to go
117:14 - over here and i'm going to say react and
117:17 - let's go ahead and do
117:18 - i need to import it first you stay so we
117:20 - have a piece we have a variable called
117:22 - light which is declared by the
117:24 - initialize with the value false
117:26 - so the first thing i'm going to do guys
117:27 - is i'm going to render this button
117:29 - based on if that's true or false so what
117:33 - i'm going to do
117:33 - i'm going to say if it's liked then show
117:36 - me
117:37 - the favor icon
117:40 - right otherwise okay okay hold on i
117:43 - think i can visually show what you're
117:44 - talking about so this is important so
117:46 - guys
117:47 - see over here we got this empty heart
117:50 - icon
117:51 - and now what we're working on is if i
117:53 - like this you'll see the number go from
117:55 - 1207. you guys see that it went from
117:58 - 1207 to 1208
117:59 - and also the heart icon became failed
118:03 - now i always thought it fills up like
118:05 - somebody actually fills this icon with
118:07 - color
118:07 - but sunny is actually just using a
118:09 - different icon which already is
118:11 - filled right sunny yeah yeah material
118:14 - icon if i go here and i type in heart
118:16 - you guys will see there is favorite and
118:18 - favorite border so basically
118:20 - if it is if the state is liked
118:24 - yeah this state over here if the state
118:27 - is
118:27 - liked then it's gonna pull this favorite
118:30 - one
118:31 - and if the state is not like which in
118:34 - the start is false
118:36 - it is going to be this empty one so does
118:39 - that make sense so far guys
118:40 - does that help okay awesome
118:44 - dope so now what we're gonna do guys is
118:46 - we're going to have
118:47 - the favorite border icon so this is the
118:50 - one that's not filled
118:51 - i'm going to say show that if it's not
118:53 - liked right so now
118:55 - uh to finish things off so that's the
118:57 - first step right and if we save that
118:59 - it should format it nicely there we go
119:01 - and basically what we're going to do now
119:02 - is that whenever we click on
119:04 - either of those icons we need it to
119:05 - basically toggle the liked state
119:08 - so for this one what i'm going to say is
119:09 - for the first one i'm going to say
119:11 - uh oh nice so nitesh kumar says does the
119:14 - javascript course contain uh react
119:17 - uh like react content as well uh we have
119:19 - live react coaching calls with myself
119:21 - every tuesday so yes it does and i run
119:24 - you through projects like this and sunny
119:26 - even shows up to those live coaching
119:28 - calls
119:29 - exactly i'm there guys
119:32 - we can pretty much have a chat like if
119:34 - you get stuck in something we can go
119:36 - ahead and
119:36 - pretty much debug it on a live zoom call
119:39 - so it's not just a chat it's a zoom call
119:41 - so you can actually have a i can see
119:43 - your face we can talk we can pretty much
119:44 - do all of that stuff
119:46 - awesome so for this favorite icon what
119:48 - i'm going to do is i'm going to say on
119:49 - click
119:50 - right on click and i'm going to say e
119:53 - dash so whenever on click event it's
119:55 - fine so every time i click that icon
119:57 - i'm going to say set liked right so in
119:59 - this case i'm going to say set liked
120:01 - to false because it they would have
120:03 - already liked it if you had reached this
120:04 - point
120:05 - and i'm going to go ahead and copy this
120:07 - and i'm basically going to do the same
120:08 - thing here
120:10 - but i'm going to say set like to true
120:12 - all right so
120:13 - now check out what we just did so in
120:15 - that very slick line of code
120:17 - uh what we can do now is if we click on
120:20 - the liked button
120:22 - so kazi let's go ahead and click on the
120:27 - i love when you're like trying to cue me
120:29 - in a really nice way and i just don't
120:30 - get it you're like okay guys now we're
120:32 - gonna go ahead and
120:33 - click on the hosted engrack app and i
120:36 - just don't get here
120:37 - okay guys now we're gonna
120:42 - yeah yeah yeah just call me just be like
120:44 - yo kazi click on this yeah okay
120:46 - i got you so here we have like but
120:49 - remember when we like it it should say
120:50 - 301
120:51 - in this example right so in this case
120:54 - what we're going to do is we're going to
120:54 - say rather than showing 300 we're going
120:56 - to say if liked
120:58 - yeah and guys i'll show you yes it's not
121:00 - going to be fixed to 300 i'll show you
121:01 - how we fix that as well
121:02 - if it's liked then it's going to be 300
121:04 - plus 1
121:05 - in this case else it's going to be 300
121:07 - right so this is just a demo
121:09 - sort of example here and let's just do
121:11 - that as a sort of um
121:14 - let's do that as a string here so there
121:16 - we go so now
121:17 - go ahead and try it it should work and
121:20 - it should say 301
121:26 - and then if you unlike it'll say 300
121:28 - yeah so
121:30 - so basically what is switching between
121:32 - back and forth
121:33 - is if it's 300 this is what you see
121:37 - and then otherwise it's 301 got
121:40 - it exactly that's that plus one right
121:43 - there
121:44 - nice so you see like that's how we get
121:46 - our functionality working right now i
121:47 - saw a bunch of questions
121:49 - which were regarding like why is it 300
121:51 - why is it set at that number
121:53 - so what we can actually do here guys and
121:55 - firstly also
121:56 - the icons of the the icons are looking
121:58 - kind of small right now so i'm going to
122:00 - go ahead and target all of them so i'm
122:01 - going to click on all of them
122:03 - and i'm going to basically i'm using a
122:04 - multicast right now and i'm going to say
122:06 - on and i'm going to say sorry font size
122:08 - so they accept an attribute called font
122:09 - size
122:10 - so font size i'm going to say equals
122:12 - large so this is something in material
122:14 - ui
122:14 - and you can pretty much do that very
122:15 - simply and save it and now you'll see
122:17 - all the
122:18 - the icons will be slightly bigger which
122:21 - is looks
122:21 - much cleaner yeah right so that much
122:23 - cleaner
122:24 - uh so that's cool and then what we're
122:27 - going to do is yeah so most people said
122:28 - like oh hang on but
122:29 - how do you determine what the like
122:30 - shares and messages numbers are
122:32 - so at the moment we gave it fixed values
122:34 - what we could do is actually go ahead
122:35 - and pass it in as a prop
122:37 - so here what i'm going to do is i'm
122:38 - going to say um
122:41 - i'm going to say likes shares
122:44 - and messages like shares and messages
122:48 - and kazi pretty interesting question sai
122:50 - sarath al-uru says
122:52 - your choice profit with python or
122:54 - javascript i mean if you are starting
122:56 - out
122:56 - right now i would push you towards
122:58 - profit but javascript unless you're
122:59 - already interested in python
123:01 - and you have experience and you want to
123:03 - go the python route
123:04 - then go with python but our profit with
123:07 - javascript program just has
123:08 - so much more in terms of like the
123:11 - coaching calls you get and the community
123:13 - is just so strong so
123:15 - you know i mean get both that's the best
123:17 - get both because they're both amazing
123:19 - programs we have
123:20 - literally the best programs when it
123:22 - comes to the javascript or python
123:24 - but if you're gonna decide between one
123:26 - and you a beginner right now you're
123:28 - deciding
123:29 - i would go with the javascript one yep
123:32 - exactly
123:33 - exactly definitely agree with that um
123:36 - nice so what we're going to say now here
123:38 - guys is that we
123:39 - passed in these props as like shares
123:41 - messages notice we're destructuring as
123:42 - well
123:43 - so don't forget to do that um and then
123:46 - what we're going to do is change this so
123:47 - where we have likes
123:48 - we're going to basically pass that in
123:50 - here so we're going to say likes
123:52 - plus one and even here i'm going to say
123:54 - i'll show the likes
123:56 - and even here i'm going to say instead
123:57 - of this i'm going to say show the shares
124:00 - so show the shares and then here i'm
124:01 - going to say instead of this show the
124:03 - messages
124:04 - all right show the messengers and then
124:05 - what we can do is where we render this
124:07 - out now
124:08 - so where we render it so for example
124:10 - here what i can now do is i can say
124:12 - likes equals let's just say equals one
124:15 - one one
124:16 - so i'm gonna should make this very easy
124:17 - to show that it's working like this is
124:18 - one one one
124:20 - channel um so what's it like uh messages
124:24 - equals two to two and uh
124:27 - shares equals three three three
124:32 - if i save that now we should see that
124:35 - the
124:35 - uh it gets updated and it says 111 323
124:39 - and 222. so
124:40 - the reason why that is saying that is i
124:41 - actually set messages
124:43 - to 222. so i'm actually i'm using the
124:46 - props in the wrong place so
124:48 - we have the messages here so i should
124:49 - need this needs to be messages
124:51 - this needs to be shares so make sure you
124:52 - do check your white guys because a
124:54 - simple mistake to make
124:55 - um and then that should actually fix it
124:57 - and flip it so
125:00 - save that and we now we can see that it
125:03 - says
125:03 - yep one one one two two dope and if we
125:07 - click the
125:07 - the heart it says one one two nice okay
125:10 - so that's perfect guys
125:11 - now what we can do is we can actually go
125:14 - ahead so we have that working
125:16 - and if we go ahead and scroll through
125:18 - oops we go ahead and scroll through the
125:20 - app
125:20 - so guys if you scroll through the app i
125:22 - will scroll through the app
125:25 - hey yeah nice right so everything's
125:29 - working and you see like nothing
125:30 - gets messed up so those icons actually
125:33 - move with that card so they're actually
125:34 - like
125:35 - positioned with that card which is
125:38 - really nice right that video component
125:40 - they're positioned inside of that video
125:41 - component
125:42 - so they actually move alongside it so it
125:44 - kind of like looks like it's like all
125:46 - stuck to that that video
125:48 - uh component i see it's a really nice
125:50 - finishing touch right
125:52 - so that's something to keep in mind um
125:54 - and now what we're gonna do
125:55 - is we're actually gonna go ahead and i
125:58 - guess i think at this point
126:00 - we actually are ready to whoa
126:03 - hold on before we i'm not going to skip
126:05 - over this one i don't care
126:07 - daniel said daniel says daniel costa
126:09 - says i just got my first
126:11 - internship with react because of you

126:55 - uh yeah the fact that you watched it all
126:57 - we really appreciate that
126:59 - um awesome let's carry on guys so
127:02 - the next step is to actually right now
127:05 - we've got this fixed
127:06 - data right we've got this fixed data
127:07 - coming through so instead of doing this
127:09 - and we sort of render out this video
127:11 - video video video video stuff
127:12 - instead i want to pull this from a
127:14 - database right on a post from a database
127:16 - and i actually want to sort of pass in
127:18 - some props which then go ahead and
127:20 - get passed through to the video footer
127:22 - and to the video sidebar
127:24 - so what am i going gonna need i'm gonna
127:25 - need channel description song likes
127:27 - messages shares
127:29 - so what i need to do now is go ahead
127:31 - over to video
127:32 - and i'm gonna go ahead and pop these in
127:34 - right here so
127:36 - what i'm gonna need now is i'm gonna
127:38 - need the following so
127:39 - here video boom and let's go ahead and
127:43 - get rid of this
127:44 - so you have url channel description song
127:46 - likes messages and shares
127:48 - and now what i'm going to do is i'm
127:50 - passing these through as props right
127:52 - so i want to basically have it so that
127:54 - these
127:55 - pull from our props so this would then
127:57 - become the following so it would say
128:00 - so we would have the video sidebar which
128:02 - would be this
128:04 - so we're basically going to replace it
128:05 - with the following so it's going to say
128:07 - likes equals likes messages equals
128:09 - messages
128:10 - shares equals shares like like such
128:12 - right so we have those
128:14 - and then for the footer i'm actually
128:16 - going to go ahead and see the
128:17 - same thing so it's not going to pull
128:18 - from our values here but it's going to
128:20 - pull from the props are passed through
128:21 - to it
128:22 - so it's gonna say video footer and if i
128:25 - save now
128:26 - it will go ahead and format and you can
128:28 - see that it says channel description and
128:30 - song equals song so if i just drop this
128:33 - onto a new line
128:34 - to make it clear for you guys we've got
128:36 - the description we've got the channel
128:38 - there we go so you see something like
128:39 - that right so we've got that for you
128:42 - guys so the channel description song and
128:44 - then we've got the same for the video
128:45 - sidebar
128:46 - so now it's pulling in from the thing so
128:47 - now we can see that nothing's showing on
128:49 - the right because we're not
128:50 - actually passing those props in so what
128:53 - i'm going to do to fix that
128:54 - is go ahead and show you guys a
128:56 - completed sort of one now so here
128:59 - if we pass in the correct prop so we had
129:01 - the following we
129:02 - had a url so a url of some kind
129:05 - we had a channel so in this case let's
129:07 - do a channel
129:08 - um and let's do raphe kazi let's do that
129:11 - one
129:12 - and let's go ahead and do a description
129:16 - and we can say like uh wow this one
129:19 - i think uh and then we can do a song
129:22 - so let's just do uh the sunny song
129:27 - right and then all the sun is only okay
129:31 - i actually thought i was writing
129:32 - something there wow my brain's going too
129:34 - much
129:34 - right and then i say likes equals
129:38 - one two three so we've got 123 likes
129:40 - let's do a number instead so 123 likes
129:43 - we have messages let's just say it went
129:45 - viral and we had like i don't know so we
129:47 - have
129:48 - a bunch of messages on it 400 and then
129:50 - we have
129:51 - the shares so shares here is going to be
129:54 - let's just say 200. so that's cool but
129:56 - the url we need to grab a url so i'm
129:58 - going to quickly grab
129:59 - a url quickly so give me two secs uh a
130:02 - url that i would do is i'll do cards
130:04 - video here so let me go ahead and copy
130:05 - the video address
130:07 - and paste it nice and now guys
130:10 - these props are going to get passed
130:12 - through the component and into those
130:14 - video footer and video sidebar areas so
130:17 - now what we should see is if i save this
130:21 - let's check it out
130:25 - it should be reloading in a sec

132:58 - the props and
132:59 - uh i couldn't actually for some reason
133:01 - i'm grabbing the other url but i'm going
133:02 - to use this one then fine
133:04 - um so you can see it's actually
133:05 - rendering the correct video right so
133:06 - it's got the video coming in
133:08 - oh i see why it's not using it silly
133:11 - mistake the video
133:13 - guys is still using the old source so
133:16 - you need to go here and actually go
133:17 - ahead and use the url
133:19 - so i was doing it right the whole time
133:20 - but i kind of was like yeah that was
133:22 - correct the whole time
133:23 - um so now if i save this it should come
133:25 - up with kazi's video
133:27 - hey there it is hey let's go
133:30 - here so does it work are we able to play
133:33 - it or no
133:34 - yeah yeah we can play
133:39 - [Music]
133:42 - nice
133:46 - all works guys and that's exactly what
133:48 - we want and expect so
133:49 - if we swipe through now it's obviously
133:51 - blank because there's no other we
133:52 - haven't passed in the correct props for
133:53 - the other ones
133:55 - so with that said what we're going to do
133:57 - now is go ahead and actually use the
133:59 - firebase
133:59 - that we used that we set up earlier so
134:02 - what we need to do is open up the
134:03 - uh command line so let's open up the
134:05 - command line
134:07 - uh-huh so kazi open up the command line
134:10 - you got it yeah and uh let's open up
134:14 - the yep zsh and we need to npm install
134:17 - firebase
134:18 - to pull in the firebase um npm install
134:22 - firebase there we go right and while
134:25 - that's doing that what we're going to
134:26 - need to do
134:27 - is we're going to need to import
134:28 - firebase into this file so we need to go
134:30 - and go ahead and say import firebase
134:32 - from firebase
134:33 - and we need to go and write the
134:35 - following so this line okay
134:37 - is like sugar sha is so cool that's my
134:39 - girlfriend that
134:40 - she's the one right there on the left
134:42 - she taught me how to do that dance move
134:46 - nice so we have the
134:51 - um nicholas says i think everything yeah
134:54 - yeah
134:55 - yeah kazzy sunny and has his names as
134:59 - variables absolutely class i love that
135:01 - dude
135:01 - or actually here's the funnier one
135:04 - i think every object oriented
135:07 - programming javascript book should have
135:09 - kazi sunny and nasa's names because they
135:11 - are absolute class
135:13 - hey i was waiting for this where is it
135:19 - yeah there we go so
135:23 - guys this line is going to be magic for
135:24 - you pretty much what it's doing is it's
135:26 - using
135:27 - the config that we pulled in earlier and
135:29 - it's initializing a firebase app
135:31 - instance
135:32 - right so basically in this one variable
135:34 - we have access to that firebase app
135:36 - and then what we do is we say make a
135:38 - variable called db which stands for the
135:40 - database
135:41 - and basically go into our firebase app
135:43 - instance and go ahead and grab
135:45 - firestore so go ahead and grab the file
135:48 - which is the database this is the
135:49 - database instance right
135:50 - so once we have that what we're going to
135:52 - do is i'm going to say export
135:54 - so export default db
135:58 - and what this does is it basically is
136:01 - going to
136:02 - export the db and
136:05 - export the db and allow us to use
136:07 - basically go ahead and access the
136:08 - database right so
136:10 - with that said what i'm going to do now
136:11 - is just go over to firebase and this
136:13 - actually adds some information inside of
136:15 - there
136:17 - okay firebase got it here we go
136:23 - yeah so let's go to uh firebase let's go
136:27 - to the database
136:28 - oh i found a bug on firebase hey they
136:31 - need a developer to fix this
136:34 - oh [ __ ]
136:37 - all right you know they use material ui
136:40 - wow like guys look at this
136:44 - our front end is sometimes even better
136:46 - than theirs because even these guys got
136:47 - bugs
136:49 - yeah look at that all right what are we
136:51 - doing sonny what do
136:52 - tell me what to click on we are going to
136:55 - uh the
136:55 - database okay i got you i got you i just
136:57 - didn't know what we were
136:59 - so database tab and then what we're
137:02 - going to click on is
137:03 - create database yep make sure you start
137:06 - it that's my test mode
137:08 - cool yep next and then here you want to
137:11 - click on done
137:12 - and this will go ahead and create you a
137:13 - database guys so it's as simple as that
137:16 - uh once this is created it uses the
137:19 - following so it uses a
137:20 - like a collection document collection
137:23 - kind of structure now what does that
137:24 - mean
137:25 - let's use this point of context so we're
137:26 - to have a collection of posts right the
137:28 - tick tock posts
137:30 - and each one is going to have a document
137:31 - inside which is basically going to
137:32 - represent the post itself
137:34 - so in this case the video all right so
137:36 - let's go ahead and click start
137:37 - collection quasi
137:40 - okay start collection here we go and now
137:43 - there's gonna be a collection of what
137:45 - videos yeah we can call it videos
137:48 - let's call this one videos what were you
137:49 - gonna call it because you sounded like
137:51 - you're not gonna call it that
138:02 - i mean actually post is not that bad
138:04 - either
138:05 - okay well we'll let the people decide
138:08 - for now i'll just call it videos
138:09 - auto id and then what so now
138:12 - all of the fields are going to be
138:14 - corresponding to
138:16 - let's look at the code for a sec so we
138:18 - basically need
138:20 - to add all of these into our database so
138:22 - let's go ahead and show the code
138:24 - show the code okay yeah
138:28 - so show the code so you see we've got
138:29 - the url channel description
138:31 - song likes and one two three so let's go
138:33 - ahead and add this information
138:35 - into the database nice all of this
138:38 - okay cool yes so i'll do url
138:42 - and i'll copy this url yeah yep
138:46 - okay and i'll paste it guys this url we
138:49 - got from tick tock the video itself we
138:51 - went
138:52 - to the video go in inspect mode
138:55 - and then bada bing bada boom you got it
138:59 - channel okay so channel
139:03 - i'm gonna blaze through this thing
139:05 - rafikaze description
139:08 - uh uh-huh there we go
139:12 - okay we got song we got the sunny song
139:16 - why is it with the
139:17 - it's with an o bro why do you put it
139:19 - with the u
139:20 - no there's a there's a sunny song uh
139:22 - with the you
139:24 - yeah yeah that's how i was like because
139:27 - everybody misspells your name in the
139:29 - um in the comments
139:33 - all right so now we're about to get to
139:35 - different types so this is going to be a
139:37 - number i believe
139:38 - we're going to put one two three in here
139:40 - and then we got
139:42 - shares boom add field
139:46 - and messages i believe will also be a
139:49 - number so i'm going to put
139:50 - 400 in there copy
139:55 - and there you go okay hit save just
139:58 - click add
139:59 - yeah and that's it guys so now if we uh
140:02 - make that full screen we can see we've
140:04 - got a collection of videos
140:05 - and don't worry about don't be scared of
140:07 - that unique id that's generated randomly
140:09 - that's just one video with a
140:11 - yes silly name yep so that's a unique id
140:14 - for that one video
140:16 - and then we basically want to have it uh
140:19 - all of the uh
140:20 - item as in all of the data are inside
140:22 - about that video
140:23 - so these are called documents here right
140:26 - yep and what are these called inside
140:31 - yeah the documents filled okay so guys
140:34 - here's the important thing right so your
140:35 - collection
140:36 - all your video collection is like just
140:39 - this one thing here right
140:40 - then every single video you pop in is
140:42 - just going to start stacking up in here
140:44 - so right now it's one video
140:45 - then after this you can add like another
140:47 - video and that's gonna have
140:50 - you know whatever another random id and
140:52 - then you have video three
140:53 - so on and so forth and inside of each of
140:55 - those videos
140:56 - it contains its own information and
140:58 - we're now going to show you how we're
141:00 - going to be able to access it pretty
141:02 - soon
141:02 - if you guys are pumped yeah smash that
141:04 - like button drop it in the comments
141:06 - in the live chat exactly and guys think
141:09 - of videos it's just like an array it's
141:10 - just an array of uh
141:12 - videos inside of it so that's awesome
141:16 - so cardi i think as i explained this
141:18 - next bit and i could sort of code it
141:20 - through
141:21 - maybe if you could add another uh
141:23 - document so we've got two documents that
141:25 - way we can show that it's pulling from
141:26 - the database
141:27 - okay cool go for it yeah so what we're
141:30 - going to do now guys is
141:32 - inside of the app what we're going to do
141:33 - is we're going to make use of the uh so
141:35 - we need to create a piece of state which
141:36 - is going to basically
141:38 - pull from the um so pull from it it's
141:41 - going to pull from the database
141:43 - right so in this case we're going to can
141:44 - you give me one more url
141:48 - uh yeah let me go ahead and drop you on
141:50 - one now so
141:52 - give me one sec dude you can drop it in
141:54 - slack too whichever one
141:58 - yeah so i would do it um let me joking
142:01 - slack
142:05 - there we go got it oh nice
142:09 - so now what we're gonna do guys
142:13 - is we are going to go ahead yeah so we
142:16 - need a piece of state to keep track of
142:17 - the videos right so
142:18 - i'm gonna do videos set videos and this
142:20 - is to be by default so you're setting up
142:22 - by using a used state hook and we're
142:24 - going to say an empty array
142:25 - right so use the empty array and then
142:28 - we're going to say
142:30 - use state like this all right now
142:33 - what we're going to do is we have the
142:35 - videos here so
142:36 - the end goal is that basically we're
142:38 - going to say something like this we're
142:39 - going to say videos
142:40 - oops videos dot map and for every single
142:44 - video
142:45 - what i'm going to do every single video
142:48 - what i'm going to say is
142:50 - give me back so for every single video
142:52 - give me back
142:54 - the following so i'm going to say render
142:56 - out a video
142:58 - but and i'm going to at this point the
142:59 - video we're mapping through each video
143:01 - but i'm going to actually destructure at
143:02 - this point to make life a little bit
143:03 - easier
143:04 - i'm going to say destructure out of the
143:06 - video the url
143:07 - the channel the description
143:11 - the song the likes the messages
143:15 - and the shares so i'm just pretty much
143:18 - typing that out now so it should drop
143:19 - onto a new line so we can see yep we've
143:21 - got the url channel description songs
143:22 - likes
143:23 - uh messages and shares and then here
143:25 - what i'm going to do is i'm actually
143:26 - going to pass them in through as prop so
143:28 - it's going to be
143:29 - something like this can say url equals
143:30 - url
143:32 - channel equals channel
143:35 - song equals song likes
143:39 - equals likes messages
143:42 - equals messages and
143:45 - descriptions the description equals
143:48 - description
143:49 - and then shares he's gonna basically
143:53 - guys he's like
143:53 - looping through each video and then he's
143:56 - just gonna like
143:57 - write it out what it is exactly so it
144:00 - loops through all of those videos inside
144:02 - this array
144:03 - and it's essentially going to loop
144:04 - through that and it's at this point it's
144:07 - empty so it's not going to show anything
144:08 - but we're going to populate this with
144:09 - the database uh and it's going to be a
144:11 - real-time connection and the vignesh
144:13 - says we should definitely do a session
144:15 - on graphql plus apollo for react that
144:17 - actually would be a fun one dude let's
144:19 - actually do facebook ads
144:20 - with graphql yeah we could do that
144:23 - that'd be dope
144:24 - yeah definitely so to prove to you guys
144:28 - that it's not uh
144:29 - pulling from here anymore i'm gonna go
144:31 - ahead and delete all of our hard-coded
144:33 - stuff so
144:34 - now you can see that like if i go ahead
144:36 - and save this it's actually gonna
144:38 - it's gonna show anything on the screen
144:39 - so it's gonna be blank right so just to
144:41 - prove to you guys
144:42 - there you go nothing is being shown it's
144:44 - a blank screen of just like oh
144:46 - right so now we're going to use a use
144:49 - effect so use effect
144:51 - is basically a essentially all the user
144:54 - effect is guys it's
144:55 - really powerful and it replaces all of
144:58 - the life cycle hooks
144:59 - um inside of a class-based component
145:01 - because anytime you see a hook
145:03 - uh it replaces all the client life cycle
145:07 - methods in a class-based component
145:09 - but because we're using hooks we're
145:10 - inside of a functional component here so
145:14 - here's how you write a use effect you
145:15 - basically have a function
145:17 - so like this and then you have as a
145:19 - second argument
145:20 - some dependencies so if you don't
145:22 - include any dependencies here
145:24 - this code will fire once so it fires
145:26 - once
145:27 - when the component loads so when the
145:29 - component loads but never again after
145:31 - right but never after so it fires once
145:34 - but never after
145:35 - if you put say for example videos in
145:37 - here then it's gonna fire once when the
145:39 - component loads
145:40 - and then um and whenever
145:44 - videos changes and whenever those
145:46 - changes because that's the dependency so
145:48 - it's dependent on it right
145:49 - so that's something to bear in mind so
145:51 - now what we're going to do here
145:53 - is we're going to say db so we're going
145:55 - to go ahead and get the db
145:57 - so i need to go ahead and import that
145:58 - from our firebase module so i'm going to
146:00 - say import the database from
146:03 - firebase so from our firebase notice how
146:05 - that i'm doing the forward slash dot to
146:07 - refer to the one that we have in our
146:08 - local
146:09 - um and also uh i need to i'm just going
146:11 - to move our firebase into
146:13 - our source there we go nice yep
146:17 - so now we say db dot
146:20 - collection so this is actually going to
146:23 - that videos collection that carsi
146:25 - created on firebase
146:27 - and then what we're saying is get like
146:30 - literally
146:31 - take a snapshot of that at that exact
146:34 - moment or a live snapshot
146:36 - of what this sort of uh videos
146:38 - collection looks like
146:39 - get that snapshot and what do we want to
146:41 - do with it i want to set the videos
146:44 - in our state to the following so i need
146:46 - to set this and this is the array that
146:48 - we initially declared
146:49 - up here right so i'm going to say set
146:51 - that to whatever is inside of that
146:53 - snapshot
146:54 - get the documents which is all of those
146:56 - videos that we saw inside of firebase
146:58 - map through each one and for every
147:01 - single document
147:02 - go and get me the doc data right go and
147:05 - get me the doctor oops go and get me the
147:07 - doc
147:08 - dot data all right
147:12 - and what this does guys is this is
147:14 - actually a super powerful line
147:16 - uh super powerful thing right here so
147:18 - what this is doing is it's setting the
147:20 - videos
147:20 - and any time this is a sort of a live
147:23 - listener so what it's doing is every
147:24 - time
147:25 - it's like just one second uh he's like
147:28 - is the component did update
147:30 - lifecycle method is it like that yeah so
147:34 - a component did update is every single
147:36 - lifestyle
147:37 - method has been replaced by the use
147:39 - effect method nice
147:41 - the hook yeah right yep
147:44 - and i'm gonna pop open on the right hand
147:46 - side what you were
147:47 - um talking about right now sonny which
147:50 - is like
147:51 - the snapshot.docs guys i think
147:54 - you know one easy way to kind of see it
147:56 - is the snapshot.docs
147:58 - this will actually get you access to all
148:00 - of these docs right here
148:03 - and um here where he's getting
148:05 - collection to the video collections that
148:07 - he's accessing this then he goes hey get
148:10 - me
148:11 - the all the videos inside of that
148:14 - collection
148:16 - yeah and then what sunny can do is
148:18 - basically
148:19 - loop through the each document
148:22 - so here's doing doc dot data and that
148:25 - actually
148:26 - so he loops through this is the first
148:27 - loop and then the second loop will get
148:30 - you the second video
148:31 - and by doing doc.data this part over
148:34 - here
148:35 - he can get each of those videos you know
148:38 - all of this
148:39 - all the data in it exactly and that
148:42 - bubbles up into an array so we have like
148:44 - an array of objects
148:46 - and then we render those array of
148:47 - objects uh
148:49 - over here where we do videos.map and we
148:52 - pretty much render those out like yeah
148:54 - look like this guys but like video one
148:56 - video
148:58 - two and then you can you can then you
149:01 - can do things like
149:02 - oh god damn it i didn't want it to go
149:04 - away one second i'm gonna write that
149:06 - again
149:07 - so here it's going to bubble into
149:08 - something like this you guys it'll be
149:10 - like video one
149:11 - and video oops video two
149:15 - like that and then at the bottom you'll
149:18 - be able to do things like video dot
149:21 - url oh oh yeah
149:24 - um and that will actually be able to
149:27 - pull you
149:28 - this guy right here map is what allows
149:31 - you guys to you know loop through it in
149:32 - an easy way which is where you'll see
149:34 - this map thing but like ultimately this
149:37 - is how you'll be able to like access
149:39 - uh access the url of each video or
149:42 - access the channel or whatever you want
149:46 - exactly exactly nice um
149:50 - funny when you take three shots of
149:52 - coffee no
149:54 - um so now what we're gonna do
149:57 - is um i'm gonna save
150:00 - right so let's get our app open on the
150:03 - right hand side
150:06 - uh because you just get the app open yep
150:08 - so now what i do is when i save it
150:10 - this is gonna go ahead map and on
150:12 - snapshot gets a live listener so if
150:14 - anything gets added to that database or
150:16 - anything it's gonna go ahead and and
150:18 - sort of refresh and sort of go ahead and
150:19 - pop in the new data here
150:21 - not going to refresh though it's going
150:22 - to dynamically sort of import it in
150:24 - right so as soon as i click save now
150:26 - watch how when it refreshes on the right
150:29 - side so when when our app sort of
150:30 - refreshes we'll actually get
150:32 - that data being pulled from the database
150:34 - now if everything went well
150:36 - okay so let's take a look i'm refreshing
150:41 - so whoa
150:44 - you're telling me it's pulling from the
150:46 - database yep yeah
150:48 - that's pulling from the database now oh
150:49 - by the way yesterday we built youtube
150:51 - guys
150:52 - so if you you know missed out on that
150:54 - then make sure you go check that out on
150:56 - our youtube
150:57 - yeah when you say it like that it's
150:59 - actually insane
151:01 - yesterday we built youtube you know
151:02 - today oh yeah yeah yeah yesterday we
151:04 - built the youtube clone
151:08 - bust it out in days um so
151:12 - here we go guys here is so let's see
151:15 - so the first one says wow this works so
151:18 - here
151:18 - is the description that i see in the
151:20 - database
151:23 - here we go so boom wow this works and i
151:25 - see that right over here
151:26 - wow that works and the channel name i
151:30 - see rafikaze
151:32 - and then the sunny sunny is what's being
151:34 - passed in the ticker
151:36 - so yeah guys what do you think of that i
151:38 - mean that's pretty freaking cool right
151:39 - like we're able to actually go literally
151:42 - to a database
151:43 - pull it out and it was all in real time
151:46 - without even refreshing
151:47 - good luck doing something like that that
151:49 - fast with postgres
151:51 - now because it showed the dynamic uh
151:54 - updates i
151:55 - was just gonna literally do that
151:58 - so what we can say is we're
152:02 - live on youtube
152:06 - right now and let me actually go like
152:08 - that hit update and let's see what
152:10 - happens
152:12 - look at that look at that
152:15 - that dynamic just popped in no refresh
152:18 - or anything guys
152:20 - yeah that is what is so freaking sick
152:22 - about firebase you guys
152:24 - like this is what we're trying to get
152:25 - through and crash into your head like yo
152:29 - firebase is king look at that 400
152:32 - and it just did it instantly it was so
152:35 - fast and now 401
152:37 - and i can change this to be 320
152:40 - and i can now go and click it and it'll
152:42 - be three i mean come on you guys no
152:44 - refresh nothing all in real time two-way
152:47 - database thing give it up for sunny guys
152:50 - smash that like button yeah yeah guys if
152:53 - you found that cool
152:54 - smash the like button because that is
152:55 - like seriously when we first started
152:57 - getting that working like it's so
152:58 - powerful and it's really like
153:00 - it looks so simple how we did that but
153:02 - like just appreciate it like that's
153:04 - really complicated under the hood like
153:06 - that's actually something so powerful
153:08 - so simple and yeah and all of it
153:12 - happened so
153:13 - damn fast you guys and if we change the
153:15 - url of this video
153:16 - i'm sure we would actually get a
153:18 - different video in there

156:03 - you're enjoying it stick around
156:04 - and let's go ahead and crush this yeah
156:08 - let's do it i think we literally just
156:10 - finished the final part which means
156:12 - well now yep we actually are going to
156:16 - the major step right now which is the
156:19 - big deployment guys
156:22 - and you guys want to play with the app
156:24 - and see it for yourselves we're going to
156:25 - show you guys how easy it is to use
156:28 - firebase
156:28 - hosting to actually go ahead and deploy
156:30 - so if you're excited
156:31 - let us know in the comments now let's
156:34 - guys it's going to be awesome we're
156:35 - going to show you how
156:36 - easy it is to actually deploy this app
156:39 - so i'm going to show you guys the
156:41 - process that we actually go through so
156:43 - first things you guys got to do
156:44 - is make sure you do firebase init
156:48 - yep all right once we do this
156:53 - it's gonna open all this stuff up we
156:54 - just want to do hosting and nothing else
156:56 - right sunny
156:57 - yep just hosting hosting we're gonna do
157:00 - existing project because it's already
157:02 - existing
157:03 - hit enter for that we're going to choose
157:06 - the
157:07 - tick tock clone and then we're going to
157:10 - say
157:10 - build this is important because on the
157:12 - left hand side
157:14 - what it's going to do is create a folder
157:18 - um right over here that's actually going
157:20 - to say
157:21 - build so that is going to be awesome
157:24 - so let's go ahead and do that
157:28 - i don't see anything where was i writing
157:31 - there we go build
157:33 - all right and now make sure because all
157:36 - react apps are single page applications
157:38 - spas you want to do why don't sleep on
157:41 - this you guys because
157:42 - no is the default so make sure to hit
157:44 - yes yo
157:46 - frank what is what is happening bro
157:50 - why do you do this i'm gonna cry one day
157:52 - on these streams
157:53 - so much i'm actually gonna just
157:56 - tic tac amazing dude popped us up
158:01 - so guys uh i'm pop popping this up on
158:04 - the screen
158:05 - frank just dropped 25 thank you so much
158:07 - and he says
158:08 - he has the instagram youtube and now
158:10 - tick tock in his react portfolio
158:12 - that is absolutely sick and um
158:17 - you know that's some boss stuff right
158:19 - there frank so
158:21 - um you know we're gonna get something uh
158:24 - what's up i said we massively appreciate
158:27 - you frank and like like we said like
158:29 - once we're in the l.a sort of mansion
158:31 - like
158:31 - definitely come through that'll be
158:33 - insane and uh here's the actual footage
158:36 - of frank
158:36 - you guys
158:38 - [Laughter]
158:40 - that was he didn't know we were
158:42 - recording him
158:44 - all right guys so let's get back
158:47 - all right oh [ __ ] it's actually built
158:50 - the
158:51 - index folder is there so we go or the
158:54 - build folder is right there which is
158:56 - awesome
158:56 - and now we just got to do a few things
158:59 - guys so now it's time for npm
159:01 - run build yep and what this does is it
159:04 - strips off all the developer stuff
159:06 - inside of our build so it makes it super
159:08 - lightweight gets rid of all the
159:10 - unnecessary stuff
159:11 - shrinks the code down so that it's
159:12 - really fast um so that way when we
159:14 - deploy it it's just going to be super
159:16 - super fast
159:17 - um and then once that's done kazi what
159:20 - is the next step after that
159:22 - yep so let's go once this is done
159:28 - um the next step is going to be after
159:31 - this is just deploy you guys we're
159:32 - pretty much
159:33 - done we're just waiting for this folder
159:35 - to build out
159:36 - what react is doing right now is just
159:38 - creating this nice little folder
159:40 - we're storing i almost imagine like
159:43 - react as this like
159:45 - little guy and then when you build this
159:46 - build folder he has like this briefcase
159:48 - and that briefcase contains everything
159:50 - inside that build folder
159:52 - and that's what's going to get deployed
159:53 - onto firebase
159:55 - so there's this cute little briefcase
159:56 - he's a little guy and he just puts
159:59 - shoves everything in there and like
160:00 - closes and tries to cramp it because he
160:02 - has to compress it so everything is fast
160:03 - and can fit in this
160:05 - lean briefcase you know so
160:08 - you know exactly gets stripped off
160:11 - everything in here yeah
160:15 - uh i think actually at this point oh
160:17 - there we go there we go there he comes
160:19 - in so then you'll see
160:20 - once it's finished npm on build you get
160:23 - that stack folder and a bunch of other
160:24 - stuff
160:25 - also guys something to remember if you
160:27 - make any changes to your code
160:28 - now after you do npm run build you have
160:31 - to do npm run build
160:33 - again before you deploy because it's not
160:35 - going to be the most up-to-date sort of
160:36 - optimized uh build inside of that
160:39 - briefcase that cause he was mentioning
160:40 - right
160:41 - yep and now guys we are getting ready
160:44 - for the final step
160:46 - if you are ready for the final step
160:50 - make sure you drop it in the comments
160:52 - and let us know because now it's time to
160:55 - pull some boss moves
160:56 - and hit deploy yeah hey
161:01 - i love these gifts man
161:04 - all right let's do it if you're ready
161:08 - let us know in the comments you guys
161:10 - this is it there's the moment
161:12 - of truth and you guys will be able to
161:13 - play with it now
161:16 - exactly you guys will be able to mess
161:18 - around with this to play around with it
161:19 - and just
161:20 - you know see our videos up and live yeah
161:23 - and guys it's so fast when he does this
161:25 - deployment like
161:27 - he just clicked upload a deploy and
161:29 - there you go there we have it live
161:31 - let's go ahead and drop that in the
161:32 - comments all right
161:34 - we're gonna drop it in the comments but
161:36 - first i gotta check and make sure it
161:38 - runs because that could be really
161:39 - embarrassing that it doesn't run
161:42 - oh yeah hey
161:45 - it is here you guys and you guys will be
161:47 - able to click on it watch it
161:49 - guys before i give this app to you first
161:51 - of all i want to know do you actually
161:53 - want it
161:54 - if you want it then we'll drop it in the
161:55 - comments otherwise we won't
161:57 - because youtube gets mad at us sometimes
161:59 - secondly
162:00 - i have to show you how to use it so make
162:03 - sure what you guys do when you have this
162:05 - app is scroll
162:06 - and then stop okay scroll don't keep
162:09 - scrolling because otherwise you will
162:10 - never get to see how the snapping
162:11 - functionality works so
162:12 - scroll stop scroll stop
162:16 - and then you can actually click the like
162:18 - button right you can actually appreciate
162:20 - the ticker here at the bottom
162:22 - and all of that stuff so i'm about to
162:24 - drop it right now
162:25 - in the chat some of you guys were tech
162:26 - savvy you already saw the link so you're
162:28 - probably in here that's all good
162:30 - but guys the damn thing is deployed
162:34 - and now all we can do here
162:37 - is just
162:41 - drop the air horn for you guys
162:45 - if you guys enjoyed this guys smash the
162:48 - like button drop it in the comments
162:49 - below and let us know that you're pumped

164:52 - literally about that number yeah
164:53 - like any donation that is made like it's
164:55 - huge to us like and we really really
164:57 - like it's like
164:58 - it shows us that you guys really are
164:59 - interesting you guys find value from it
165:01 - which is why we love this and why we put
165:02 - in the time to do that
165:04 - yeah seriously thank you and hajira says
165:06 - um
165:07 - don't stop with the faces and the future
165:09 - streams yeah and if you guys enjoyed
165:11 - you know i had some gifts coming in hot
165:14 - for you guys so you know maybe
165:17 - we can show more of that in the next
165:18 - streams too
165:20 - yeah definitely but yeah
165:24 - says sonny would you make a video on
165:26 - higher order components very good point
165:28 - we might make like a small series i
165:29 - guess of like snippets videos i guess or
165:31 - something like that
165:32 - that would be kind of cool or like maybe
165:34 - in the next uh episode or something we
165:36 - can pretty much
165:37 - go through some app with higher order
165:38 - components in that'd be cool
165:40 - nice yeah that was becky's favorite
165:42 - question becky asked that many times
165:44 - during the stream
165:45 - okay i'm glad because we just never had
165:48 - a great time to answer it but sometimes
165:50 - we queue it up for the
165:51 - end so sometimes just be patient with
165:54 - those guys
165:54 - we can't cover because sometimes we're
165:57 - making these tutorials in a way where if
165:58 - somebody's watching the replay they can
166:00 - still get value and if we keep doing too
166:02 - many q and a's in the middle
166:04 - it kills the flow for somebody who's
166:06 - watching the tutorial so
166:08 - you know if the question is relevant to
166:11 - what sunny's doing right then and there
166:12 - then i can pause pop it up on the screen
166:15 - have sunny answer it or i can answer it
166:18 - because if some replay person is
166:20 - watching it'll still help them but if
166:21 - it's too
166:22 - like different then we can address it
166:26 - later at the end
166:28 - yeah v han v says this is like watching
166:30 - a movie
166:31 - i love that nice yeah yeah
166:34 - that's great yeah i mean we put in a lot
166:36 - of work so we want to improve it later
166:38 - by doing a lot of things like um we're
166:40 - at 83 dollars right now
166:43 - radon asks how much left to get to 100
166:45 - we're at 83 right now so i think 17 but
166:47 - this is all good because
166:49 - you know we we don't expect any of this
166:52 - but we
166:52 - really just appreciate you guys so
166:54 - anything is just really awesome i mean
166:56 - we're going to be coming in here kicking
