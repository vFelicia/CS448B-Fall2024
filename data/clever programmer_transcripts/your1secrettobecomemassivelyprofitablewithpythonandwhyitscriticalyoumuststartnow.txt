00:00 - that's really i'm live online alright
00:11 - let's do this thing let's bring this
00:13 - here oh I'm not actually live on
00:17 - Instagram yet hey guys what's up how's
00:21 - it going
00:22 - this is Kazi from clever programmer
00:24 - dot-com awesome this is amazing bunch of
00:29 - you guys are here don't know how many
00:32 - yet but I will find out in a second
00:35 - looks like zero people are watching is
00:37 - that true okay so we have a few people
00:43 - here that's good we have a few people
00:45 - going on Instagram awesome ok great to
00:49 - have you guys here
00:50 - settle in guys so today we're gonna be
00:54 - talking about your number one secret to
00:57 - become a Python profitable massively
01:00 - profitable programmer okay and why it's
01:04 - critical that you must start now so what
01:07 - I want you to do is kind of buckle in
01:12 - alright get some popcorn get some coffee
01:15 - kind of like I got here from Dunkin
01:18 - Donuts and just sit back and kind of
01:23 - enjoy alright we're gonna be covering
01:25 - did you make sure that it the landscape
01:28 - mode is unlocked because if you don't do
01:31 - that it'll like mess up the whole thing
01:32 - so end it and then order just yeah
01:35 - figure it out awesome cool alright so
01:40 - what we're doing today is we're actually
01:42 - gonna be live on YouTube we're also
01:44 - going live on Instagram and we're gonna
01:48 - be going live on Facebook and I'm lucky
01:52 - to have my friends here today helping me
01:54 - because usually it's like there's too
01:56 - many things going on it gets really
01:58 - confusing and so today it's gonna be a
01:59 - lot simpler alright
02:21 - okay so guys make sure that what you
02:24 - start doing is also start posting your
02:26 - questions and I want you to start
02:29 - thinking of the types of questions
02:30 - you're gonna be asking all right and so
02:34 - then later when we get into kind of like
02:36 - the Q&A section a little bit I want to
02:38 - get your most burning questions and
02:40 - answer them for you while I have you
02:43 - here okay I want to do that and in this
02:46 - livestream what I'm gonna be covering
02:49 - I'm gonna be going over a lot of what a
02:51 - Python developers lifestyle is like I
02:54 - want to tell you how I negotiated you
02:58 - know going from $50 an hour to $100 an
03:02 - hour in one phone call I'm gonna tell
03:05 - you about one of my first Python jobs
03:08 - that I ended up landing where I made
03:11 - twenty plus thousand dollars in less
03:14 - than one month and the reason why I'm
03:17 - gonna be giving you guys this
03:18 - information is so you guys can see how
03:20 - you can apply this to yourself all right
03:22 - so I'm gonna be saying it from my
03:24 - perspective but I want you to constantly
03:27 - be thinking how it could be you in that
03:29 - position okay because all of these
03:31 - things I'm telling you are you know when
03:34 - I was not a very good developer I was
03:37 - just a few months in to learning about
03:40 - programming and at that time I was going
03:42 - through the same things of being just
03:44 - like super frustrated not being able to
03:47 - figure out what the hell programming is
03:49 - and grasping my mind around a ton of
03:54 - concepts so for example things like okay
03:56 - I have these coding skills I can do if
04:00 - statements I can do print and I can do
04:03 - you know some basic coding exercises on
04:06 - platforms like hacker rank or I've gone
04:09 - through some courses on Coursera Udacity
04:11 - but I was always confused as to how do I
04:15 - take those concepts and then actually
04:19 - build real-world apps with them and how
04:22 - do I go from you know just knowing code
04:24 - to actually building real apps and how
04:29 - do I go from that
04:31 - then actually charging people and making
04:34 - money making a living off of it and then
04:37 - living a comfortable lifestyle and then
04:39 - how do I go about hiring and firing my
04:42 - clients something that you can do too so
04:45 - you don't have to work with clients that
04:48 - you do not like all right so we're gonna
04:52 - be getting deep into many many many pain
04:55 - points and also we're gonna be covering
04:57 - a lot of things that give you value as
05:00 - soon as you step out of this livestream
05:03 - okay we can even call this a workshop so
05:07 - I want to give you value as soon as you
05:09 - leave and give you many many things to
05:12 - take away all right so again kind of
05:14 - relax and enjoy and we're gonna be going
05:16 - through all of this okay and how is the
05:24 - audio coming around for you guys are you
05:27 - guys able to hear me a lot clearer
05:31 - let me turn up the gain on this thing
05:33 - okay could I add some volume all right
05:36 - I'll do that all right my mic is working
05:40 - that's good and I'll turn up my gain and
05:43 - I'll also talk from a little bit closer
05:47 - okay clear okay beautiful now I'm okay
05:51 - on Instagram it's clear that's good
05:54 - Instagram volume is coming out of my
05:56 - phone and then we're basically figuring
05:58 - out right now how to set up Facebook
06:00 - that's taking a while and we're just
06:03 - gonna make sure that that's good to go
06:05 - in a second so sorry still working on
06:07 - that guys and then we are I think should
06:11 - be better on YouTube how are we doing
06:15 - Tenzin give me a little thumbs up or
06:16 - something okay okay cool all right
06:22 - beautiful we have quite a few people on
06:25 - our YouTube and we have a few people on
06:27 - our can you frame it right okay awesome
06:30 - like
06:32 - and then just make it a little bit
06:34 - taller just just here just like right to
06:39 - there and then you know just cool
06:53 - alright need to be doing more of these
07:00 - all right now I should be going live and
07:03 - I should be live on Facebook
07:05 - hello Facebook how's it going Facebook
07:08 - Instagram YouTube all right we are live
07:11 - everywhere again this is your number one
07:14 - secret okay then I'm gonna be sharing
07:17 - today to profit with Python okay this is
07:22 - your workshop that we're gonna be going
07:24 - through today and why it's critical that
07:27 - you must start on this right now all
07:30 - right
07:30 - uh-huh and I'm gonna be sharing those
07:32 - things as we go along so first of all
07:37 - let's talk about the job opportunity for
07:39 - software developers and how this market
07:41 - is growing and what your future can be
07:43 - looking like okay what the job
07:45 - opportunities are so right now okay even
07:50 - according to Forbes Python is the number
07:53 - one language of 2017 okay so this is a
07:59 - good year for us and by 2020 it's
08:02 - actually going even higher all right
08:05 - it's going to be staying at the top and
08:08 - beating out all other languages so I am
08:13 - kind of excited about that some other
08:15 - amazing things about this language
08:17 - programming language is like think about
08:20 - all of the things that are made with
08:22 - this okay so this is something I've
08:24 - mentioned before but I'm gonna mention
08:28 - it again for everybody maybe you missed
08:30 - it alright so again platforms big huge
08:34 - platforms are built with this language
08:36 - okay so Instagram where you are on right
08:39 - now is built with Python okay YouTube
08:42 - where you are right now is built with
08:45 - Python and I don't think there's a lot
08:48 - of Python used in Facebook right tenzin
08:53 - that's not true in facebook right okay
08:58 - so there are a lot of languages and even
09:00 - in Facebook there's a little bit of
09:01 - Python Spotify is built off of Python
09:05 - reddit is built off of Python Hipmunk is
09:10 - built off of Python okay events Brite is
09:15 - built off of Python so think about all
09:18 - the things that are built with Python do
09:20 - you guys know what Google is built with
09:22 - Python all right and Sergey grinned the
09:25 - CEO of Google said Python where we can
09:29 - see where we must alright so with all
09:33 - these big platforms and these platforms
09:37 - that are only growing all right we all
09:39 - have like billions of users using
09:42 - Instagram Facebook YouTube Google reddit
09:47 - Spotify and with these platforms only
09:50 - growing what this means is that there is
09:53 - simply more room alright there's simply
09:57 - more room for more programmers more
10:00 - Python developers to have those jobs ok
10:04 - and again why I emphasize Python so much
10:07 - is because it's at the perfect
10:11 - intersection essentially of being the
10:13 - easiest programming language all right
10:16 - being the most growing and trending
10:19 - programming languages and being one of
10:21 - the most paid programming languages ok
10:25 - average Python developer makes anywhere
10:28 - from ninety to a hundred and thirty
10:30 - thousand dollars a year even more okay
10:35 - and it even and it depends where you
10:38 - live okay so if you're living in places
10:41 - like California in the heart of where
10:43 - the technologies that you can be even
10:46 - making more money okay and if you're
10:47 - living somewhere we're like Kazi I'm not
10:50 - getting and if you're living in a place
10:54 - where it's like Kazi there isn't much
11:01 - going on here we can't network with
11:04 - people for programming we can't find
11:06 - jobs for programming we can't find where
11:11 - we can get independent contractor work
11:13 - for programming you know what you should
11:15 - do you know what you should do
11:18 - obviously one stop making excuses and
11:22 - two you know what you should do leave
11:27 - that place relocate okay if that is the
11:32 - case like just the other day this
11:34 - reminds me I was on sorry I'm just gonna
11:37 - check if the audio is coming off well on
11:41 - YouTube
11:44 - coming off good audio yeah all right so
11:48 - we got good audio going awesome alright
11:53 - so if you're gonna leave and also
11:55 - sometimes like I'm talking take where
11:57 - I'm at because sometimes I forget so I
11:59 - just remind me thank you okay so
12:02 - basically when you're what so we either
12:05 - relocate right but don't make excuses
12:07 - and the reason why I'm kind of going off
12:09 - on this tangent is yesterday I shared
12:12 - one of my youtube videos which is what
12:15 - would I do if I were 18 again and you
12:18 - know it's I called it like your
12:19 - explosive four four secrets to your
12:21 - explosive career growth you know which
12:23 - is true and in that video I mentioned
12:27 - you should be doing things like creating
12:29 - content and sharing with the world and
12:31 - contributing to the world instead of
12:33 - just thinking procrastinating and
12:35 - lingering and then I had somebody who
12:37 - said cause II I'm 40 years old maybe
12:42 - this is something that works for a 22
12:45 - year old but I don't think this works
12:47 - for a 40 year old and so I saw that
12:51 - message and I'm like okay this is pretty
12:54 - interesting and also he complained that
12:56 - he was 40 so he said he was too old to
12:58 - get started and it'll take too long but
13:01 - then I told him look my story maybe
13:03 - should even motivate you because most of
13:05 - the results clever programmer went from
13:07 - having nobody zero subscribers right to
13:10 - having hundred thousand subscribers
13:12 - followers I got value out of it right if
13:14 - you're here you probably at some point
13:16 - got value out of it and so I told him
13:20 - that and I said look it means it
13:22 - possible for you to get these results in
13:24 - one year and you know what he told me
13:26 - back he replied and he goes well may
13:31 - I could get this in one year but he goes
13:34 - I'm living in places like New York San
13:38 - Fran and Washington DC he goes if you're
13:41 - forty or too old so you can't get that
13:43 - and then at that point I'm like if
13:48 - you're gonna just victimize yourself and
13:50 - look I'm on your side I'm trying to help
13:52 - him trying to motivate you and I'm
13:54 - trying to tell you it's possible I'm not
13:55 - just motivating you for the sake of
13:57 - motivating you I don't like doing that
13:59 - right if I but it's possible and it's
14:05 - not even that hard to do so why are you
14:07 - just putting these limits and
14:09 - restrictions on your own mind and
14:11 - stopping yourself from achieving these
14:13 - goals it's just kind of toxic and so I
14:16 - said like look you're just kind of
14:18 - putting limiting beliefs but then again
14:20 - he just kept going and arguing and at
14:22 - that point I was like okay you argue as
14:24 - to why you will never ever ever ever
14:27 - succeed you know I'm on your side but
14:30 - you're gonna argue that you're not gonna
14:31 - succeed so at that point I can't help
14:33 - you so if you're watching this remember
14:36 - that a lot of it has to do with your
14:39 - mindset okay where is your mind at if
14:42 - you don't think you deserve a lot of
14:44 - money or you don't think you deserve
14:45 - that Python development job you then
14:48 - won't get it okay you don't actually
14:50 - then deserve it so you have to change a
14:53 - lot of how you rewire your brain okay
14:57 - you have to kind of rewire that thing
14:59 - all right so we've hit on why Python is
15:04 - beating all other big programming
15:07 - languages and why it's so so so so so
15:10 - good okay it starts from if you're in a
15:12 - complete beginner you can learn super
15:14 - fast but if you're not just a beginner
15:17 - you know another benefit of it is
15:19 - companies like Instagram YouTube Google
15:22 - reddit spot if I built off with it so it
15:25 - means that there are just tons and tons
15:27 - of jobs the jobs are never going away
15:29 - it's only increasing at an exponential
15:32 - rate okay as long as platforms like
15:35 - Google reddit YouTube Spotify Hipmunk
15:37 - Eventbrite da-da-da-da-da as long as
15:39 - they keep growing the number of job
15:42 - opportunities for Python developers will
15:44 - only keep growing
15:45 - right and even when you get into
15:47 - artificial intelligence software
15:48 - developers are the ones that are running
15:50 - it I mean look at scan and go at Walmart
15:54 - all right it's replacing the people
15:56 - there guess whose scan and go is
15:58 - programmed by by programmers okay it's
16:01 - something that's actually programmed
16:03 - look at Google car self-driving cars
16:06 - programmers have to actually program
16:08 - that to work Tesla all right
16:11 - your phones your iPhone your snapchat
16:15 - like every single thing there's code
16:19 - running it every online platform that
16:21 - you're using so to think that it's
16:24 - something that's gonna die off in a few
16:27 - years or it's a dying career it's just a
16:29 - complete fallacy like a logical fallacy
16:33 - all right so now I kind of want to share
16:39 - with you guys my you know my story of
16:41 - how I went from getting that negotiating
16:46 - that $50 to $100 deal okay I literally
16:51 - went from making $50 an hour to $100 an
16:55 - hour with one phone call all right and I
16:59 - want to share that story with you and
17:01 - you're gonna learn a ton from it you can
17:04 - literally take this and apply to exactly
17:07 - what you're doing right now whatever
17:09 - company you're working in right now this
17:11 - has the potential to give you that race
17:13 - raise race give you that boost in your
17:17 - salary or maybe you're a freelancer and
17:19 - it can give you the boost in the money
17:22 - you're making and how comfortable you're
17:24 - living right now because because again
17:26 - the reason why we want to be earning
17:29 - more and getting paid over just what we
17:30 - deserve is not just for the sake of
17:32 - money itself right we want to take care
17:35 - of those around us we want to take care
17:37 - of our families we want to be able to
17:39 - support not only ourselves but the other
17:42 - people that we have in our lives
17:44 - because I think personally that it's
17:46 - selfish to only make enough to keep
17:49 - yourself happy okay I think that we
17:53 - should be focusing on making enough to
17:55 - kind of have everybody live that
17:57 - comfortable lifestyle around us so we
17:59 - can
17:59 - kind of help them if they need okay so
18:02 - this is why I think it's really
18:05 - important that you get actually paid
18:06 - what you deserve and that you're not
18:08 - overworked and underpaid okay that's my
18:12 - number one thing even if you leave this
18:15 - and you're like I'm never gonna touch
18:16 - Python or I'm never gonna touch
18:18 - programming I want you to be a I want
18:20 - you to be able to apply this in your
18:22 - life so tell me right now
18:26 - Instagram Facebook YouTube are you ready
18:32 - to hear the story are you ready to hear
18:35 - the story where I went from fifty to a
18:37 - hundred dollars an hour where I
18:39 - literally saved half of my life where I
18:42 - saved half of the years of my life you
18:45 - know kind of doing that because if you
18:47 - think about it normally you would go
18:48 - fifty debt it up and go all the way up
18:50 - and you would be spending twice as long
18:53 - and again this was when I was a beginner
18:55 - this was when I was just starting out
18:58 - okay this was when I didn't even have
19:01 - the programming skills that I do today
19:04 - I'm still not an expert okay I'm still
19:07 - not an expert having worked at a big
19:09 - company went to Community College 2.5
19:13 - GPA bad student but here's what I have
19:15 - been doing I have been making over a
19:17 - hundred and four thousand dollars
19:19 - starting at sophomore year at Oakton
19:23 - Community College okay so I'm not a good
19:28 - student
19:29 - but I do know how to provide value to
19:32 - people in the world and I do know how to
19:34 - get other people results okay and I want
19:36 - to share that with you so again
19:37 - are you ready if you are I want to be
19:40 - hearing a hell yeah all right we're
19:46 - getting some hell yes let's put this
19:48 - Facebook one just a little bit higher
19:50 - cuz it's like my hair's cutting off and
19:51 - my hair just looks so good today I want
19:53 - to make sure that it's seen all right
19:59 - just like you know just taller like okay
20:03 - there we go
20:04 - cool
20:06 - cuckoo-land you know dishes okay all
20:09 - right so here's the story okay buckle
20:12 - and buttercups let's go all right so
20:15 - here here it is let me let me grab some
20:17 - coffee in the meantime all you guys just
20:18 - you know wait for the story everybody's
20:22 - hooked man okay so here we go
20:35 - I had just gotten back from my Community
20:40 - College okay my Oakton Community College
20:42 - not exactly Harvard and I was wearing my
20:48 - like backpack and I got in i kind of got
20:52 - done doing homework sat down was just
20:55 - kind of relaxing and I'm gonna tell you
20:58 - guys about how I landed the client okay
21:01 - that paid me 20k in one month and then
21:03 - also the 1500 they're connected so and
21:08 - what I had done a few days before was I
21:11 - was posting on Craigslist okay of being
21:15 - a Python developer all right and check
21:17 - this out I was posting about some random
21:20 - stuff like I'm gonna tutor people in
21:22 - Python I didn't even know what I was
21:24 - doing but three few months into my just
21:27 - learning programming I was posting about
21:29 - tutoring and teaching people coaching
21:32 - people and what it ended up happening
21:34 - was somebody reached out to me that day
21:37 - called me and I picked up the phone and
21:39 - I was like who's this and then they said
21:41 - we're calling from da data company and
21:43 - they're like we need help building a
21:46 - customer relationship management system
21:48 - and at that time they didn't even
21:51 - actually know what they needed they
21:52 - didn't even call it a customer
21:54 - relationship management system like he
21:55 - was on the phone with me and he's like
21:56 - yeah we need a portal for our clients so
22:00 - they can log in and so also the
22:02 - employees can log in I'm like okay this
22:06 - said we need something that can hold the
22:08 - invoices so basically the client can see
22:11 - the invoices and then the company can
22:14 - also see them invoices and the client
22:16 - can kind of log into their own account
22:18 - to see
22:19 - and I was like okay cool and at this
22:22 - point literally the only few things I
22:24 - could do but code is like I built some
22:25 - Coursera projects okay like I had built
22:28 - take Tac Toe and rock paper scissors
22:31 - like some simple games I hadn't
22:33 - literally done any practical things yet
22:35 - and they're like also it should be able
22:39 - to handle accounting so basically as we
22:43 - go through this it should do the
22:46 - automatic and accounting automatically
22:48 - because what that will do for us to save
22:49 - us like 10 to 50 hours a week for our
22:54 - our employees doing it manually and I
22:57 - said and I was on the phone at this
23:00 - point I was like okay like that's a lot
23:04 - of stuff man like I can barely do
23:06 - anything I never even made something
23:07 - with I cannot forget accounting I hadn't
23:11 - even made something that could let you
23:13 - log in I don't know how was gonna store
23:15 - that information what happens if they
23:17 - log out how does everybody how can
23:19 - everybody go to this one website but
23:20 - then have their own account and see
23:22 - their own information and not anybody
23:24 - else's information how do I make it
23:25 - secure like what's the security issues
23:28 - that was going on so literally I was so
23:31 - lost I was like okay so this is not
23:34 - gonna be happening like I'm done I
23:37 - should just end the call and the joke
23:39 - and this funky joke and just get off the
23:42 - phone and say hey I can't do it okay but
23:44 - I kind of just amused that idea and I
23:46 - was like okay cool I can do that and
23:48 - then he said we'll also need a way where
23:52 - it can use react so that's a like a
23:57 - JavaScript framework it's a little
23:58 - complicated but basically what he said
24:00 - that that when we're sending emails it
24:02 - should look and feel really high-quality
24:04 - and essentially we should be able to
24:06 - write emails from within the software
24:09 - and we should be able to edit emails
24:11 - from within the software and so when we
24:13 - send emails and messages they can reply
24:15 - back to them and we can also see if
24:16 - they've opened the email if they've not
24:18 - opened the email if they've reviewed the
24:20 - proposal or if they've not reviewed the
24:22 - proposal have this signed it like so
24:25 - many things and if wants to sign it it's
24:27 - automatically connected with their
24:28 - accounting thing and when their
24:30 - employees get there it automatically
24:31 - checks them
24:32 - and all the information is searchable so
24:36 - for example if any of their employees
24:38 - have went to the clients home and have
24:40 - done whatever needs to be done and came
24:42 - back that information should be
24:44 - searchable okay so there are just so
24:47 - many moving parts right there's so many
24:51 - things going on and I'm like I was
24:55 - laughing I'm like there is no way that
24:57 - I'll be able to do this okay so but I
24:59 - was on the phone I was like yeah okay I
25:02 - can do it I can do it and they're like
25:03 - okay cool and they're like we saw your
25:06 - rate and that time a tutoring rate or my
25:08 - coaching rate that I put up was like
25:10 - fifty dollars an hour and I had coached
25:12 - a few students at that point and and I
25:17 - was like okay yet so he's like we've
25:20 - seen your coaching rate and so are we
25:23 - good to go can we get started this week
25:25 - and I was like yeah sure let's get
25:29 - started this week like let's do it and
25:31 - as soon as the call ended I remember
25:35 - calling my friends and I was like oh my
25:37 - god I'm like I just got this offer this
25:40 - Python like you know they didn't say a
25:42 - specific language they just said like
25:44 - they need a solution to a problem and
25:46 - I'm like okay I'm gonna use Python I'm
25:49 - gonna learn Django I don't know how to
25:51 - store information but I've heard that
25:52 - there's something to do with databases
25:54 - databases allow you to store information
25:55 - so then you can create your own account
25:57 - you can log in you can like do all this
25:59 - cool and it's not just a boring
26:01 - website that has contact pages and
26:03 - resumes this has a lot of things and I
26:06 - remember telling that to my friend my
26:07 - friends like he's like dude are you sure
26:09 - you're gonna be able to do this this
26:10 - sounds so crazy
26:12 - and I said yeah maybe I'll give it a try
26:14 - but what I want you to keep in your mind
26:17 - right now as you're listening to this is
26:19 - notice that I didn't say that I can't do
26:22 - this okay I didn't just self-sabotage
26:26 - myself even though I that time I
26:27 - couldn't do it I wanted to give it a try
26:29 - and I wanted to just say yes even though
26:31 - it sounded insane then what I did is I
26:34 - started going and like learning about
26:36 - these courses taking these courses and
26:39 - learning about something like sequel but
26:40 - basically what I've started doing was
26:41 - learning about how databases and things
26:44 - like that worked and I finally figured
26:45 - that
26:46 - and when I walked into the office the
26:48 - first day I actually had something put
26:51 - together and let me remind just a little
26:52 - bit before I got to the office the first
26:54 - time I remember it was 2:00 a.m. and I
26:56 - just learned about how I can hold a
26:58 - database with all the information of
27:01 - stuff so even if you leave this website
27:03 - and come back all the data all the new
27:05 - data that you added is there and if you
27:07 - log out and log back in everybody sees
27:09 - something different so I had just got
27:12 - that feature implemented at 3m and I
27:14 - remember I was so excited that I texted
27:17 - the person who was trying to hire me the
27:19 - recruiter or whatever like at that
27:20 - company I texted him 3m and I'm like
27:22 - sent him the video I took like a
27:25 - snapchat video and I sent him the video
27:28 - of like done you know the first part is
27:31 - already done and at this point they
27:33 - hadn't even told me to do and get
27:35 - started they said we're gonna get
27:36 - started the first time you see us but I
27:39 - was so excited I got it I got some basic
27:42 - parts of the app done and I then sent it
27:44 - out to them at 3 a.m. okay so think
27:47 - about how crazy that is all normal
27:50 - beliefs should tell you that I shouldn't
27:53 - be getting this job that they would
27:54 - think I'm too crazy that would they
27:57 - would think like this kid is insane you
27:59 - know sending stuff at like 3:00 a.m. but
28:02 - it was quite the opposite actually what
28:05 - they loved at that point was that he's
28:07 - literally not caring about the time and
28:11 - whatever and he's just putting in work
28:13 - and actually giving value without just
28:16 - necessarily being like this needy dude
28:18 - who's looking for something back all the
28:20 - time for anything that he or she does in
28:22 - return and so I send them this and at
28:26 - 3:00 4:00 a.m. he responded to me and he
28:29 - was super excited he's like this looks
28:30 - amazing he's like this is great he goes
28:33 - can't wait to see you on Monday and I
28:35 - was like all right cool
28:36 - and basically I ended up going I ended
28:39 - up meeting them and they just loved me
28:41 - and they loved the fact that I was
28:42 - already I got started and got things
28:44 - done and they even paid me for the time
28:47 - I mean also I brought it up I was like
28:49 - hey guys I've already worked for five or
28:51 - ten hours and that's my rate so this is
28:53 - you know what the bill would be for all
28:56 - the stuff that's already completed so
28:57 - again I also know
28:59 - to charge what I'm worth and not just
29:01 - wait on other people to tell me so if
29:03 - you're listening to this have a pen and
29:05 - paper with you because this is so
29:07 - important this can literally be saving
29:09 - you years of your life alright this
29:11 - could be saving years of your life right
29:15 - yes
29:16 - so this could be again saving you years
29:19 - of your life I'm gonna get to that and
29:21 - what you want to do is be taking these
29:24 - notes down and telling yourself one
29:26 - don't have these limiting beliefs okay
29:30 - don't self-sabotage yourself to provide
29:33 - value without always asking for
29:36 - something in return three charge what
29:38 - you're worth and kind of be firm about
29:40 - it okay so know what you should be
29:43 - charging don't just let people walk all
29:44 - over you super super important I've had
29:47 - so many friends you know who don't
29:50 - charge what they should be charging even
29:53 - though they're more talented and when we
29:56 - tell them we can help them and help them
29:57 - increase that rate instead they fight us
30:00 - and tell us why they don't deserve to
30:03 - have a higher rate or they don't deserve
30:05 - to have that better job and how this is
30:07 - actually helping them but being at this
30:09 - lower level job so again guys a lot of
30:11 - mental stuff that's gonna be stopping
30:13 - you
30:13 - alright so write these down as you're
30:16 - listening to this okay so now I've
30:20 - already got this it's done they're
30:22 - already paying me fifty dollars an hour
30:23 - everything is going good but then I
30:27 - talked to my mentor okay at that time my
30:30 - mentor was Nick okay and Nick is awesome
30:35 - his name is Nick drain if you find him
30:37 - on github or something like that
30:40 - I don't know you'll probably find him he
30:41 - currently is working at full stack
30:44 - Academy coding boot camp and I just gave
30:47 - all his information away enjoy Nick and
30:50 - basically he was my ultimate mentor he
30:55 - helped me accelerate my progress by
30:57 - literally years I swear to God
31:00 - if I didn't have him mentoring me I
31:02 - would be years and years behind like all
31:04 - this content that you guys see now and
31:05 - all this programming stuff that you guys
31:08 - get now from clever programmer there's
31:09 - no way you would be seeing this in like
31:11 - five to ten years from now
31:14 - so basically what I want you guys to be
31:17 - doing is you know as you're listening
31:20 - again be following along so my mentor
31:23 - Nick he was teaching me all these things
31:25 - and helping me and at that point I'm
31:27 - like okay I could rely and rely on him
31:29 - for help because what he was for me was
31:33 - a trusted adviser okay
31:36 - he wasn't just like this needy
31:37 - freelancer or just somebody who's trying
31:39 - to help me forgetting something in
31:41 - return and I was doing the same thing I
31:43 - was like this hungry hungry student and
31:45 - I would do anything he wants but in
31:47 - return as long as he could help me learn
31:49 - coding and that's the kind of the same
31:51 - way I went in when I was working with
31:53 - this company I went in as a trusted
31:55 - adviser and you know instead of this
31:59 - needy weird freelancer thing going on
32:01 - okay so that's another thing you should
32:02 - write down and I always brought them
32:04 - more value without even thinking about
32:08 - what I'm always getting back in return
32:10 - so going back I called Nick and I was
32:13 - like this is so exciting I got a
32:16 - full-time position for something that I
32:20 - would do for free and not only would I
32:23 - do it for free and enjoy building that
32:26 - software okay
32:27 - like out of my mind enjoy building a
32:29 - software I would literally pay money out
32:32 - of my pocket to get to work on such an
32:36 - awesome project okay
32:38 - so think about that for a second I would
32:40 - pay money out of my pocket to work on a
32:43 - project like that and here I was not
32:45 - only getting to work here where I'm
32:48 - paying to do this not getting to work
32:50 - here as an intern where I'm doing this
32:52 - for free but getting to work here where
32:54 - I'm paid so I was literally going crazy
32:58 - and I would always be doing math I'm
32:59 - like oh my god fifty dollars an hour and
33:02 - five hours that's like this much money
33:04 - and in ten hours it's like five hundred
33:06 - dollars in like two days I make like a
33:08 - thousand dollars this is insane like I
33:11 - go for a lunch break and I come back and
33:13 - I've made like 100 bucks I'm like this
33:15 - is just unreal I don't know what how
33:17 - this is happening and I called my mentor
33:20 - and I was like I'm making $50 an hour I
33:22 - got this job this is so cool right and
33:24 - he goes how much are they paying you
33:26 - and I'm like fifty bucks and he goes for
33:33 - somebody who's he goes granted you're
33:35 - new and you don't have any experience
33:37 - and you're starting out he goes still he
33:41 - goes if you're doing work as an
33:43 - independent contractor he goes you
33:44 - should be charging twice or three times
33:46 - as much and I'm like what he's like
33:50 - especially for software developers and
33:51 - he said specially for Python developers
33:54 - and I was listening to this and I was
33:55 - like are you serious
33:58 - $100 $100 me an hour like this is a
34:02 - full-time thing or at least I was
34:06 - getting 20 to 30 hours of work from them
34:08 - and he goes yeah you should do it and
34:12 - I'm like just call them like right now
34:14 - and he goes yeah and I remember getting
34:18 - off the call at that time okay I got off
34:22 - the call and hung up and I was like
34:24 - freaking out because at this point I'm
34:27 - supposed to be calling Nick and talking
34:29 - with him and I remember literally like
34:31 - my hands were shaking you know I was
34:36 - shaking because think about this I'm
34:40 - getting this amazing opportunity
34:42 - somebody's paying me what I want it's
34:44 - way better than anybody dreams of when I
34:47 - told this to my friends at that time in
34:49 - college who are making $8 an hour $10 an
34:52 - hour I mean to them is just on freaking
34:55 - real and they're like you must be greedy
34:57 - as hell to be wanting more when I told
34:59 - this to my parents they're like be
35:01 - thankful for what you're getting when I
35:05 - told this to my brothers and ask them
35:06 - for adviser like be happy with what
35:09 - you're making and then you know making
35:10 - more comes with experience and a lot of
35:12 - years and years and years and a lot of
35:16 - education you haven't even graduated yet
35:18 - and you're at a community college just
35:19 - be thankful thankful and so there were
35:22 - all these people telling me not to go
35:25 - for more money and then I had Nick
35:27 - telling me of course
35:29 - $100 not even a question done and so you
35:35 - can imagine at the age of like what 2021
35:37 - sitting here to some
35:39 - an opportunity really thinking what I
35:41 - should do but here's something that
35:44 - helped me in my decision I already had a
35:47 - bunch of clients that I was coaching
35:49 - okay and making good money from that so
35:53 - I wasn't so dependent on how this went
35:57 - and even if I was I would still do this
36:00 - the same exact way
36:05 - shaking kind of getting worried of
36:07 - scared and then I got upstairs took out
36:11 - my phone and then I'm like God on this
36:14 - call okay
36:15 - and they didn't pick up I called again
36:21 - the second time always call twice that's
36:23 - another thing write it down okay if
36:25 - you're listening to just write it down
36:26 - always call twice anybody are calling
36:28 - curiosity is a people want to know
36:31 - what you're talking about and some most
36:33 - of the times when people ignore it's not
36:35 - because they're not there but it's
36:37 - because they just sometimes ignore it
36:40 - okay because they're talking to somebody
36:42 - they don't think it's that important so
36:43 - call twice call twice he picks up on the
36:47 - other end and I'm like hey so the $50 an
36:51 - hour rate is actually my coaching rate
36:56 - and my tutoring rate but my consulting
36:59 - rate to work with the client is actually
37:02 - $100 an hour and then on the other end
37:09 - it was kind of just like this what you
37:12 - feel right now just and literally look
37:16 - my hands were kind of shaking and I just
37:18 - heard nothing from the other end and I'm
37:21 - sitting there I'm like oh oh
37:22 - like what's going on I'm like really
37:25 - scared at this point and then he
37:28 - responds and he says okay sounds good
37:32 - let us get back to you on this hung up
37:35 - and then I didn't hear for full 24 hours
37:37 - later and so at this point I'm freaking
37:40 - out but I'm trying to keep calm just
37:41 - going about my day and I'm like this
37:43 - doesn't happen that's okay
37:45 - learning experience okay this is like a
37:47 - reference so I'll learn it and I'll keep
37:49 - this in my mental note and move on from
37:52 - there
37:52 - as I have to learn how to negotiate if I
37:55 - can negotiate literally if I'm going
37:57 - from fifty to hundred dollars an hour
37:59 - don't just think of it as one job going
38:00 - from 50 to 100 an hour what this means
38:03 - it is I'm saving half of my life for
38:06 - fifty dollars an hour let's just say in
38:09 - a year I'm just throwing out round
38:10 - numbers that like just to simplify it
38:12 - but let's say you make fifty thousand
38:13 - dollars in one year but if you can just
38:16 - get on one uncomfortable phone call and
38:18 - make hundred dollars an hour and let's
38:20 - say now at the end of the year somehow
38:21 - you're making 100k a year you've doubled
38:24 - your time the same amount you've doubled
38:27 - the money you make and the same amount
38:29 - of time the work that would take you two
38:32 - years now takes you one year the work
38:34 - that would take you ten years now takes
38:35 - you five years all right so not only is
38:39 - this gonna be giving you the lifestyle
38:40 - that you want okay
38:43 - not only is it going to be adding that
38:44 - side income that you want or whatever
38:47 - this is also gonna be helping you spend
38:49 - time with your friends and family that
38:51 - you love okay so keep in mind why more
38:55 - money is important okay it's not just
38:57 - we're gonna be sitting on this pile of
38:59 - cash okay the main goal is that you go
39:02 - out you have fun you buy your friend
39:04 - bunch of things you buy gifts for your
39:06 - mom your girlfriend whoever without
39:08 - having to have that guilt of like I
39:10 - really need to check my bank account but
39:14 - I shouldn't write that guilt but instead
39:17 - in this case you're more like I'm not
39:20 - gonna check my bank account because I
39:21 - don't have to okay I know I'm good so
39:24 - that peace of mind is really the most
39:26 - important thing so anyways they got back
39:29 - to me 24 hours later and I just see this
39:31 - long text from my preview of the phone
39:33 - so I'm like walking in coming back again
39:35 - from Oakland Community College and in in
39:39 - this time between in this 24 hours I've
39:41 - gotten so much heat from my family I've
39:44 - gotten so much heat from my friends and
39:46 - they're just like you don't deserve this
39:48 - you just looked a gift horse in the
39:50 - mouth you had this amazing opportunity
39:51 - and you just ruined it you always want
39:54 - more all this crazy nonsense okay got
39:58 - home saw this big preview kinda had a
40:02 - feeling what was going on but wasn't
40:04 - sure and then ultimately
40:06 - realize who I'm talking is YouTube so
40:08 - I'm on Instagram Facebook there and I'm
40:11 - talking to YouTube right now and I see
40:16 - this message I go through it and
40:17 - basically long story short the message
40:21 - was pretty much congratulations all
40:23 - right
40:24 - those congratulations you got it okay
40:27 - and I remember reading that I just like
40:34 - literally skim through all the text
40:36 - didn't even read what the text was about
40:38 - just read the part that said like
40:39 - congratulations we'll start this
40:42 - Wednesday I'm like oh oh my god what the
40:50 - hell just happened like what just
40:51 - happened I literally half to my life
40:54 - like half the lifetime of work that I
40:56 - need to do negotiated something
40:59 - absolutely insane sat through this I
41:01 - just couldn't believe it
41:02 - and I didn't tell anybody for a while
41:05 - for that day for a few hours people were
41:08 - just like why are you sitting like this
41:10 - why are you so shocked why do you look
41:12 - traumatized cause II like I would just
41:14 - go I hung out with my friends and I was
41:16 - just shocked or lookin at them not even
41:19 - speaking and now finally you know I let
41:22 - the cat out of the bag or cat out of the
41:25 - hat I don't know what the expression is
41:26 - but um I told them that this was the
41:30 - case and every single person who had
41:34 - told me don't do it and had given me
41:36 -  for it was just kind of looking at
41:39 - me incredibly shocked but I'm not the
41:42 - person to tell you I told you so or
41:44 - whatever I don't even make a few people
41:46 - feel guilty so I'm just like yeah I got
41:48 - it you know just like you said I would
41:50 - and they're like yeah yeah you know I
41:52 - believed in you yeah of course like we
41:54 - knew you could do it I mean don't you
41:56 - think we knew you could do it and then
41:57 - they're like yeah of course we knew but
41:59 - even though that didn't say that at all
42:01 - when I was going through that and Nick
42:03 - was like of course why wouldn't they pay
42:05 - you hundred dollars an hour he's like of
42:06 - course so unbelievable situation for me
42:11 - okay again remember where I'm coming
42:13 - from for those of you who are just
42:14 - tuning in you know Oakland Community
42:17 - College student 2.5
42:20 - GPA 19 a CT out of 36 19 is so bad
42:25 - you're borderline really dumb okay and
42:31 - now I'm learning Python development I
42:34 - find that I'm actually good at something
42:35 - even though I wasn't good at math I
42:38 - spent a lot of time figuring out coding
42:41 - and I'm like I'm good at this and then
42:45 - getting paid what I deserve
42:47 - maybe at that time maybe even slightly
42:49 - more than a dessert but I don't know cuz
42:51 - now that I look back at it how hard I
42:53 - work and how diligently I worked and how
42:55 - much value I provided around the clock
42:57 - without thinking even about time I think
43:00 - I deserved that Pape and another thing I
43:05 - want you guys note down is think about
43:08 - what having a mentor can do for you okay
43:12 - so having that mentor versus everybody
43:15 - else literally changed my life
43:17 - increased me two times the speed of what
43:21 - my life would normally go at okay with
43:24 - just one word that he told me and also
43:27 - how he taught me software development so
43:29 - if you don't have a mentor in your life
43:31 - you know look around and see if you can
43:34 - find one okay try to find one you don't
43:36 - always have to pay them but if you even
43:40 - go to meetup groups and even go to local
43:42 - events and just hang around like-minded
43:44 - people you can be learning a lot a lot a
43:47 - lot from them so make sure that you
43:49 - write all of this stuff down okay cool
43:52 - how was that did you guys like hearing
43:56 - that was that valuable for you guys
43:58 - valuable let me know
44:06 - huh
44:16 - exactly --part says here I am with a 3.5
44:19 - GPA going to college worried who else
44:22 - feels like that you know who else feels
44:24 - like they're busting their ass at school
44:26 - or whatever it is you know maybe a job
44:30 - but just either aren't getting paid what
44:32 - you deserve right or you feel like you
44:36 - need years of experience and you just
44:38 - need to spend five to ten years and you
44:41 - need to at least have a point port 4.0
44:44 - GPA you need to at least go to Harvard
44:46 - before you even start thinking about
44:48 - getting paid what you deserve
45:01 - yeah I mean if for me it was like one of
45:05 - the most powerful lessons of my entire
45:08 - life of my entire life and you know
45:12 - that's really the main one of the main
45:14 - things I wanted to share with you and
45:15 - how that just changes everything and
45:17 - then when I was making this much money
45:19 - and imagine imagine like I'm again at
45:23 - this time I don't really have any time
45:25 - because I'm going full-time to college I
45:27 - was also coaching students for chess and
45:30 - coding and then I'm also doing this big
45:33 - freelancing thing okay now imagine I am
45:38 - young I'm doing all these other things
45:40 - that I'm doing only have a few hours to
45:42 - work on coding on building software and
45:45 - it's so much fun that I would pay to do
45:47 - it here I was getting paid to do it
45:50 - add age of 20 or 21 I get to travel and
45:56 - I'm going to places like when it was my
45:58 - nephew's birthday and it was actually
46:01 - like literally birthday like as in my
46:04 - nephew was born all right
46:06 - he's adorable he's like two now he's
46:09 - gonna be to actually November 23rd and
46:10 - I'm gonna fly out again right when he
46:13 - was born I got to fly out I didn't have
46:15 - to rely on my family I'd have to rely on
46:18 - my friends as a 21 year old you got to
46:20 - leave just fly out pay for my own self
46:24 - not have my brother or family to pay for
46:27 - me not have my friends pay for me and go
46:30 - visit my brother see my little nephew
46:33 - okay at the hospital and that was just
46:37 - an unbelievable experience I have photos
46:39 - of everything and I'll show you guys
46:40 - where it's a lot easier because right
46:42 - now it's hard for me to excrete share or
46:43 - whatever but uh literally you know got
46:46 - to play with them and as I was doing
46:48 - that I would just be sneaking in some
46:50 - work I'm sitting at the hospital okay
46:52 - and while the nurses are talking or
46:55 - whatever and everybody else is busy I'm
46:57 - literally sitting in the waiting room
46:59 - and talking with my family I have my
47:01 - laptop open I have my feet kicked up on
47:03 - the table and I'm getting to work on
47:06 - something that's so fun and mentally
47:09 - stimulating and I'm getting paid for it
47:12 - I put in two hours right before
47:15 - getting into the room boom like 200
47:17 - bucks okay and again at that time that
47:20 - was so much to me and as a college
47:22 - student you can imagine that that's a
47:24 - lot and I could work from the hospital I
47:28 - could go and be at an amazing place like
47:31 - we were at so Golden Gate Bridge and we
47:34 - parked our car and we walked out and
47:35 - we're talking having a good time we
47:37 - spent many hours there and then I would
47:39 - sneak in just a few times here and there
47:41 - and just code and work on the project
47:45 - because I don't have to actually be
47:46 - there to be working on this and then
47:49 - BOOM put my computer away while
47:52 - traveling and having the time of my life
47:54 - and even the work that I was doing was
47:56 - so fun that sometimes my family and my
47:59 - friends would have to actually stop me
48:00 - from saying and from doing coding all
48:03 - the time from building things all the
48:05 - time and all this right and I got paid
48:11 - twenty thousand dollars in one month
48:13 - okay to be specific I think it was
48:15 - something like 20 or $21,000 and seven
48:18 - or twenty-one thousand seven or
48:20 - sixty-five dollars yeah something
48:23 - whatever twenty one seven three whatever
48:25 - but it was like a very specific number
48:27 - and I remembered it I forgot now but you
48:30 - know imagine one month and college
48:33 - student you have your state doing all
48:35 - these other things like you don't have
48:36 - time
48:37 - you're not smart you don't feel like
48:39 - you're good enough and then you can
48:41 - really be making a difference in the
48:43 - world providing value I was saving this
48:45 - company hundreds of hours of their time
48:47 - by the way and all this code I was
48:49 - writing was something I had learned in
48:51 - like three months
48:52 - so clearly I'm not a very good coder at
48:55 - this point because you need to really be
48:57 - spending a lot more time to be learning
48:59 - this stuff and it's still possible to
49:02 - putting these things together and this
49:03 - is when I was realizing like you can
49:06 - have an amazing life solid me traveling
49:08 - can be making money can be getting paid
49:09 - what you deserve but the big thing I
49:12 - started realizing was I have so many of
49:14 - so many people who are either graduating
49:17 - college or people who are 40 or 50 years
49:20 - old and either one they're just making
49:23 - excuses about their age or that they're
49:25 - not smart enough or the other people are
49:27 - graduate
49:28 - with colic from college accumulating
49:31 - hundreds of thousands of dollars of
49:32 - loans and then when they go to the job
49:34 - market whether they're young or old
49:36 - whether they've gone to college or not
49:38 - gone to college you know when they they
49:41 - don't have the actual skills nobody ever
49:44 - taught them the actual skills to land a
49:45 - job nobody ever taught them how to
49:47 - negotiate with a client nobody how to
49:51 - nobody taught them how to build that
49:52 - relationship and these fundamental
49:56 - skills were just missing from college
49:58 - for missing from the world of academia
50:00 - are not taught online anywhere I
50:02 - couldn't find this on udemy Coursera
50:04 - Udacity EDX and I've gone through so
50:06 - many of those courses literally
50:08 - thousands of dollars worth of courses
50:10 - and that's where I you know I learned
50:12 - from because I didn't have any better
50:13 - resources so just think about how many
50:16 - wrong things are taught and like
50:18 - popularized and like you have to be good
50:21 - at math to become a programmer and you
50:23 - have to be this go to this college to
50:26 - become a programmer and you have to have
50:28 - this and that it's just you know those
50:33 - were the things that caused me so much
50:34 - pain and I was like I want to build this
50:36 - channel literally for my younger self if
50:39 - there's somebody who is out there that
50:42 - could use this help you know and it
50:45 - could help them I don't care whether
50:46 - they're 60 years old or 10 years old
50:48 - this could help them that's all I needed
50:52 - and I wanted to show people like there's
50:55 - a there's a route of just theory and
50:57 - experience and that traditional route
51:00 - like you go to college you go to high
51:02 - school you go to college you graduate
51:05 - you get a job you get another job and
51:07 - then what happens you die okay there's
51:10 - that route and then there's another
51:13 - route where you can be very practical
51:15 - learn negotiation skills learn how to be
51:19 - likable not to work with the team and
51:21 - then 10 or 15% of your skills are made
51:24 - up of coding okay and then you're
51:28 - getting paid more you're landing jobs
51:31 - you're not accumulating loans so just
51:34 - think of it like the practical guy and
51:36 - the theoretical guy the fury guy so if
51:39 - you're not watching this right now write
51:40 - this down do you want to be the fury
51:42 - I or do you want to be the practical guy
51:44 - and if there are girls in here do you
51:47 - want to be the fury girl or the
51:49 - practical girl okay do you want to just
51:51 - learn all this weird esoteric stuff or
51:56 - do you want to figure out how can you
51:58 - give value to the client you're working
52:00 - with and how can you help them solve a
52:02 - problem save them time and save them
52:04 - money I was saving them fifty to hundred
52:07 - thousand dollars a year okay because of
52:11 - how many hours my software was saving
52:13 - them so was it easy for them to pay me
52:16 - fifty to twenty thousand dollars yes
52:19 - okay and I identified how much money I
52:23 - would be saving them and I told them I'd
52:26 - be saving them this much money and when
52:28 - I sent them the proposal and I said I'm
52:31 - gonna be saving you 50 to $100,000 and I
52:35 - think I should be paid a hundred dollars
52:36 - an hour to work on this and over the
52:39 - next that next month I had an invoice of
52:42 - twenty thousand dollars okay so also
52:46 - know what budget your client is working
52:49 - with okay like Bo where if you're
52:52 - working with the client who's building
52:54 - that next face book but he also he only
52:57 - wants to hire you as a you know freebie
53:00 - intern guy he has no budget and then you
53:02 - try to you start working with him and
53:03 - you spend all this time and then later
53:04 - you're like but put what am I gonna
53:06 - start getting paid I'm overworked and
53:08 - underpaid there's no money there he
53:10 - doesn't have money she doesn't have
53:11 - money okay they hired you on some weird
53:14 - promise and there's nothing there
53:16 - I work with a company that I knew had a
53:18 - budget I knew exactly what their budget
53:19 - was I knew exactly how much money I'd be
53:21 - making them and I knew exactly where my
53:23 - money that they're gonna be paying me is
53:26 - coming from so you see that's why the
53:29 - business skills are really important and
53:31 - if you miss out on them you're just
53:33 - gonna spend so many more years getting
53:36 - what you want because let's be realistic
53:38 - we want coding skills you want to be
53:40 - good programmers but I mean come on do
53:43 - we really really just want to do it to
53:45 - become a good programmer we want to do
53:46 - it so we can do something we love we

59:03 - we're gonna learn about objects and
59:05 - object oriented programming and let's
59:08 - instantiate a class but whoa whoa whoa
59:10 - let's not talk about how you can

59:14 - how you can actually provide value to
59:16 - people and how you could actually make a
59:18 - living off of it so you could share that

59:22 - feel like you're stupid okay not none of
59:26 - those classes exist okay so that's why I
59:29 - want to put this together for you so
59:31 - again highly practical I wanted to put
59:35 - this together for people who are not
59:36 - only you know yes there are people who
59:38 - don't have a job right now we're doing
59:39 - nothing and have hundreds of hours great
59:41 - you can put that in get the results
59:43 - faster but I wanted to make this for
59:45 - people who are also busy doing jobs have
59:48 - to spend time with family maybe have a
59:50 - family maybe have kids okay
59:52 - maybe our older okay yeah I don't even
59:55 - care 460 or seven years old I wanted to
59:57 - put this together for somebody who has
60:00 - all these other obligations has limited
60:02 - time maybe even two to three hours a
60:04 - week okay and so I want to make sure
60:07 - that you're getting everything that you
60:09 - need even if you're spending as little
60:10 - as two to three hours a week okay again
60:13 - you're gonna find out a lot more about
60:15 - this for now click that link and sign up
60:19 - for the free master class your
60:21 - profitable programmer master class okay
60:24 - and this we're gonna go through
60:25 - everything so the instagrams the stream
60:29 - has ended this course we're gonna be
60:33 - talking about web apps I'm not gonna go
60:34 - into what this course is about yet okay
60:37 - not gonna be doing it again take that
60:39 - free master class and you're gonna get
60:42 - just tremendous amount of value and
60:44 - everything in that master class is
60:45 - something you could take and apply right
60:47 - now if you're a guitar instructor or a
60:49 - shark hunter or I don't care what it is
60:52 - that you do right now everything that I
60:54 - always try to give in my videos is
60:56 - something you could take and apply even
60:58 - if you never become a Python developer
60:59 - okay again my goal is to help you become
61:02 - that Python developer but I want to give
61:04 - you value so you can apply this right
61:06 - off the bat okay awesome link is in the
61:13 - description so anybody who's asking me
61:15 - on facebook links in the description if
61:17 - you're on youtube link is in the
61:18 - description the link is called data the
61:21 - first client with python go to that link
61:23 - put in your email done
61:27 - there's no age restriction so to sign up
61:32 - for it there's no age restriction if
61:33 - you're young you can sign up for it if
61:35 - you're all you can sign up for it okay
61:38 - again if you have listened to my story
61:41 - today you know that those are just
61:42 - limiting beliefs okay
61:46 - that's like self sabotaging yourself if
61:48 - you listen to my story you've learned
61:50 - that I believed in myself even though I
61:55 - didn't have those skills at that point
61:57 - and I believed in myself even when my
62:00 - whole family and all my friends were
62:02 - against what I was doing which was
62:05 - negotiating a higher
62:06 - Gallery or doing work outside of just
62:09 - school or you know learning how I was
62:13 - learning okay so again don't take that
62:17 - traditional path because that only tells
62:19 - you you have to spend six years learning
62:21 - you have to spend the next ten years
62:23 - getting experience and then you can
62:25 - maybe charge $30 an hour believe it or
62:28 - not there are a lot of like just look
62:30 - online okay go to places like upward
62:32 - comm code mentor and just look at how
62:35 - many talented talented programmers there
62:37 - are 30 40 years of experience I'm
62:39 - talking okay there are legendary
62:42 - programmers way better than I'll ever be
62:44 - okay again and I'm not an expert and
62:46 - these guys are charging 20 to 30 bucks
