00:00 - as a Python freelancer you could be
00:04 - charging the normal Python freelancer
00:08 - rate which for whatever reason is not
00:11 - available online I had to find out from
00:13 - my mentor and this was something that
00:15 - helped me you know I've told that story
00:17 - where I was on a phone call and I went
00:20 - from literally $50 an hour and I talked
00:23 - with my mentor he's like go 200 he's
00:26 - like no he goes I don't care how little
00:28 - experience you have you've only been in
00:30 - coding for three months whatever he goes
00:32 - doesn't matter they're trying to you
00:35 - $50 an hour for a Python freelancer is
00:38 - not right 150 an hour is what a Python
00:42 - freelancer should be making if not more
00:45 - so he goes I know you have less
00:47 - experience if you don't feel comfortable
00:48 - with 150 just go with a hundred so I
00:50 - didn't feel comfortable at that point to
00:52 - go to 150 I wasn't sure about my skills
00:55 - I got on this phone call and I said hey
00:59 - it was a scary phone call I've talked
01:01 - about this literally my hands were
01:03 - shaking I was like deathly scared and I
01:06 - went I'm like Kay so that $50 an hour
01:10 - rate we agreed on yeah that was just
01:14 - like my rate for doing like tutoring or
01:19 - coaching students but for my Python
01:21 - consulting rate I'm gonna charge $100 an
01:24 - hour and if that's okay with you we can
01:26 - move forward otherwise you know we can't
01:29 - and then on the other side he just goes
01:33 - he goes okay we'll see if it's in the
01:36 - budget and hangs up and keep in mind I'm
01:38 - a college student with a 2.0 GPA I don't
01:41 - have a fancy degree I don't even have my
01:44 - associate degree yet I'm in my second
01:46 - year at college and for those of you
01:49 - guys know who don't know what a 2.0 GPA
01:51 - means it just means you're a terrible
01:52 - student okay just take it like that and
01:56 - for me this is opportunity of a lifetime
01:58 - and I'm getting on this call and going
02:00 - from 50 to 100 it's a scary jump but the
02:03 - next day I received a message to set
02:06 - congratulations and you start this
02:09 - Wednesday
02:10 - and when I got that message I just saw
02:13 - it from the notification at the top of
02:15 - my phone I mean it was just like I was
02:18 - sweating you know for the whole day and
02:19 - then it just all that tension all the
02:21 - headache just gone and then eventually I
02:24 - started realizing it's not really that
02:25 - big a deal to charge $100 an hour though
02:29 - it was scary for me and also that shows
02:33 - the power of having mentors because
02:35 - everybody else stimuli just saying
02:37 - you're looking a gift horse in the mouth
02:38 - you're ungrateful and don't charge that
02:42 - much just accept what they have offered
02:44 - you already especially as that student
02:46 - okay alright so now I want to now and
02:52 - tell you this $50 an hour is a pretty
02:55 - low rate for a Python freelancer to
02:57 - charge really low rate but let's say you
02:59 - start at that rate cool you start at the
03:02 - $50 an hour rate somebody said give some
03:05 - other examples other examples of people
03:09 - who charge so yeah I'm giving you
03:11 - another example so one of my mentors
03:13 - charged $30 an hour another one charged
03:16 - $200 an hour as a Python consultant I
03:19 - had a mentor who charged $300 a Python
03:22 - consultant I know of many people who
03:26 - charge 7 or 80 dollars an hour I know
03:29 - because I've hired software developers
03:31 - and they worked for me and I paid them
03:34 - 70 to 80 dollars an hour to work for me
03:37 - on Python projects so $50 is a pretty
03:41 - low rate and again the 70 $80 an hour
03:45 - people some of them are wearing in
03:47 - United States and some I hired that were
03:50 - actually in India but it doesn't matter
03:52 - to me and it doesn't matter to a lot of
03:54 - people are hiring these freelancers they
03:56 - don't care what country or and as long
03:57 - as you're good okay and as long as you
04:00 - can communicate that to them all right
04:03 - and you can get the job done
04:05 - so anyways lower hourly rate is 50 now
04:12 - let's say you have one client at $50 an
04:16 - hour let's say you land you spend the
04:18 - next few months and you get only one
04:20 - o'clock
04:20 - okay you you try really hard but you
04:23 - only get one client for one or two three
04:25 - months you try
04:26 - one client at $50 an hour and let's say
04:30 - they don't give you 40 hours of work
04:32 - let's say they don't give you 30 hours
04:34 - of work let's say they don't give you 20
04:35 - hours of work let's say they are only
04:38 - giving you 10 hours of work per week if
04:43 - you're charging them $50 an hour that's
04:48 - $500 okay in one week for ten hours of
04:53 - work and that's $2,000 a month okay I'm
05:04 - gonna say this again one client at $50
05:07 - an hour for ten hours of work per week
05:10 - gives you $2,000 a month
05:14 - write this down just like that you can
05:19 - then do the math - what can happen as
05:21 - you add more clients or as you increase
05:23 - the income or as you increase the hours
05:25 - the $2,000 a month is $24,000 in one
05:31 - full year I know that there's some
05:34 - people who are watching this right now
05:36 - that don't make $24,000 in one full year
05:38 - and you could do this with one client
05:41 - and you could do this with something
05:44 - that's actually enjoyable and fun you
05:46 - could be working on a security project
05:48 - you could be building a social media app
05:50 - with them you could be working with the
05:52 - team who's building a social media app
05:55 - so it's not even that hard you just
05:56 - communicate with them and they like you
05:58 - they just tell you what to do in the
05:59 - train you and you pick up those skills
06:01 - and then you start putting in that work
06:03 - and giving them what they need again
06:04 - it's not easy it's hard okay but if you
06:10 - follow this path okay and you use this
06:13 - this is possible all right it's doable
06:17 - the reason why when I say is not easy as
06:20 - I don't want people to come into this
06:21 - with like no intention of putting in any
06:24 - work you just want to like be lazy you
06:26 - want to be doing exactly what you're
06:28 - doing right now
06:28 - and for some reason come in here and
06:30 - think you're going to get massively
06:31 - different results if you start taking
06:34 - action on this and actually doing these
06:36 - things you'll get those results fast but
06:38 - again this is just one client I'm
06:41 - talking about all right
06:43 - $24,000 extra a year could mean you
06:45 - could start up extra business on the
06:47 - side could mean you could pay off all
06:50 - these annoying things that you don't
06:51 - like or it could mean you could pay off
06:53 - the mortgage or you know get a nice
06:55 - apartment and you don't even have to
06:57 - worry about essentially free
