00:00 - - Hey, guys, what's up?
00:01 - This is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com,
00:04 - and in this video we're gonna talk about
00:06 - how I taught myself to code
00:08 - and how you too can use
this same exact method
00:11 - to teach yourself
00:13 - and become a professional
software developer,
00:15 - so let's jump right into it.
00:18 - (upbeat electronic music)
00:29 - So I'm gonna first of all
start it off by saying
00:31 - what is computer programming?
00:33 - It's the ability to take
any idea that you have
00:36 - and to digitize it and
bring it into the world
00:39 - whether it's you want to
make practical applications
00:43 - so then you can use that
to make extra money,
00:46 - get clients, get a job, work
as an independent contractor,
00:50 - or maybe you just want to make cool games.
00:54 - Right?
00:54 - Either case, programming is for you.
00:57 - Okay, now the second thing
I wanna talk about today
01:00 - is why you should learn to code.
01:03 - Now, there are million and one reasons,
01:06 - but I'm gonna give you
some of the best ones.
01:09 - Flexibility of work.
01:11 - You can work from anywhere you want, okay,
01:13 - so you can spend time with your family,
01:15 - have a good time out doing
whatever the hell you wanna do
01:19 - and still be able to
generate a lot of income
01:23 - 'cause you can have multiple clients
01:24 - that you're working for.
01:25 - So working remotely is a great
benefit that you can have,
01:30 - and that's something that I
take advantage of all the time.
01:32 - For example, I'll travel to
California to visit my family.
01:36 - I will travel to other states
01:40 - to take Niles North High School chess team
01:42 - for chess championships
'cause I'm coaching them,
01:44 - and I don't have to worry about,
01:48 - oh, man, I have to be
at a nine to five job,
01:51 - so I think that that's great.
01:53 - Second of all, jobs security.
01:55 - Software development is the number one
01:56 - growing industry in the world,
01:58 - so there's no job scarcity happening here.
02:01 - It's only growing, right,
02:04 - so there's a huge market here,
02:06 - and whether you have a degree or not,
02:09 - it doesn't really matter as
long as you can prove to them
02:11 - you can actually code or build
some applications for them.
02:15 - Okay?
02:16 - So with that said, let's move
on into the third section.
02:20 - So now I'm gonna go through
02:22 - how I taught myself to code, all right,
02:25 - because you can use this same exact way
02:29 - to actually teach yourself
and get started on this, okay?
02:32 - So if you've been pondering and waiting,
02:35 - I have told you why you
shouldn't wait already,
02:37 - but now I'm gonna tell you how
you can actually get started.
02:41 - So there are a million resources,
02:44 - but the one that I started
off with was Udacity.
02:49 - Okay?
02:49 - I took a course from Udacity
02:51 - called Intro to Computer Science,
02:55 - and there we built a search engine
02:57 - in like two months basically.
03:00 - So while you're building
that search engine,
03:03 - you are constantly doing
03:04 - all these different exercises as well.
03:08 - So you have this one big, massive project,
03:11 - but in between you have these
little exercises, quizzes
03:15 - to just keep you on track,
keep your skills sharp
03:18 - so you can actually then
complete that final project.
03:21 - So that was a really fun way
03:23 - that I got into the world
of computer programming.
03:26 - I remember to this day, actually,
my brother gave me a call,
03:31 - and I was at this time deciding
03:32 - what college am I gonna
go to, what should I do,
03:35 - and before I even started
the computer science course
03:39 - on udacity.com, my brother gave me a call,
03:42 - and he's talking to me, and he's like,
03:43 - "Hey, so are you thinking about any jobs?"
03:46 - I said, "Um, not really.
03:48 - "You know, maybe computer networking
03:49 - "or something like that."
03:50 - And he said, "Hey,
there's a big opportunity
03:53 - "in big data analytics, and
college graduates can be making
03:56 - "like over $200,000 if you
learn how Hadoop works,"
04:01 - so like big data analytics
and stuff like that,
04:03 - and I was like, "Wow!"
04:06 - So I thought that was incredibly awesome,
04:09 - and I started looking into
it, and so then they're like,
04:12 - "You have to learn Hadoop, frameworks."
04:16 - You have to learn all these
statistics and all that,
04:19 - and so I wanted to jump into that,
04:21 - but then I found out that
04:24 - you actually need
something more fundamental
04:26 - to get into that, which
is computer programming,
04:29 - so I had to rewind.
04:30 - Then I started learning
computer programming,
04:33 - and then after that I never looked back.
04:36 - So now let me give you my second resource
04:38 - that I actually used to learn a lot.
04:42 - Okay?
04:43 - So this resource is called Coursera.
04:47 - You can go to coursera.com
to take courses from them.
04:50 - I took the Intro to Interactive
Programming in Python course
04:53 - and basically in that course
you're building games,
04:58 - so you're building applications,
05:01 - and most of them are just games,
05:03 - so something like Pong, for example.
05:06 - The only thing I don't like
so much about that course
05:08 - is that you're not building
these in actual Python.
05:12 - You're using like a
nice, little, fun thing
05:16 - that they made on their online platform
05:18 - that you're using, but other than that,
05:20 - I still like the Coursera course
and helped me learn a lot.
05:24 - So Intro to Interactive
Programming in Python,
05:28 - that's their part one you can take.
05:30 - Then they have Intro to
Interactive Programming in Python
05:33 - part two, which is
another one you can take
05:36 - where you're building more applications,
05:38 - and then they have another series
05:41 - called Principles of
Computing, so I took that.
05:44 - And then I took Principles
of Computing part two,
05:46 - and that was more about
theory, graph analysis,
05:52 - and just understanding how
statistics and probability works
05:55 - and how all that kinda gets
tied into the world of coding.
06:00 - And we even made a game
like Yahtzee, I think,
06:03 - so it was basically you're doing
06:05 - graphical user interface development,
06:07 - so you're building actual applications,
06:09 - but then you're using the logic,
06:13 - using some more advanced stuff
06:14 - that we learned from
Principles of Computing.
06:16 - After this course, I jumped into, I think,
06:22 - I went to my college class
06:25 - where they were teaching us Java,
06:29 - and this class,
06:31 - the instructor was just
incredibly terrible,
06:35 - and most of the class was just confused.
06:39 - I paid $1,500 for this course,
06:42 - and what ended up happening was I got an A
06:44 - but ended up learning absolutely nothing.
06:47 - And I had some friends from this class too
06:49 - who I still know to this
day who learned nothing
06:52 - but got even Cs or Bs, or
some of them actually got As.
06:57 - So contrasting this online education
07:01 - on why you should pursue
the online education route
07:04 - is the cost of a college degree
are just incredibly high,
07:09 - and what's weird is that
some of these teachers
07:13 - aren't even actually
qualified to teach this
07:16 - because they aren't
working in the industry
07:18 - or creating things in the real world.
07:20 - Some of them are actually just teachers
07:23 - who are teaching others, right?
07:25 - While that's good, but
wouldn't you want to learn
07:28 - from somebody who's actually doing this
07:30 - on a day-to-day basis?
07:33 - The reason why I say this is
because technology changes,
07:37 - and the world of software development
07:39 - changes literally every day,
07:41 - so if they have a curriculum
07:42 - that's designed to last
for two, three years,
07:45 - it's very hard for them to change it,
07:46 - and usually it just
stays the way that it is
07:50 - for many years to come,
07:51 - so you're really sacrificing
a lot of flexibility
07:55 - and agility there in your growth.
07:58 - So I would say go to college,
08:01 - and I would say pursue those courses,
08:03 - but make sure that your
professors are really good,
08:06 - and also think of college as
just one learning resource.
08:10 - Most people, when they think of college,
08:12 - they think just think that,
"I have to depend on it,
08:14 - "and I can't get my education
from anywhere else."
08:17 - Right?
08:18 - So use other online platforms,
08:22 - and then mix it in and
complement what you're learning
08:25 - in your college.
08:27 - Okay, so with that said,
08:29 - let's move on to another
few things that I did,
08:33 - and then I'm gonna start
to wrap this video up
08:36 - and give you guys something
valuable at the end as well,
08:38 - so if you stay til the end,
08:40 - there's gonna be something for you.
08:43 - Basically, after I went
the Coursera route,
08:46 - I looked into Codecademy,
08:49 - so I was doing a little bit of Codecademy.
08:52 - I went through Udemy,
08:55 - so I took about five to 10
different courses there.
09:00 - Team Treehouse is another great resource.
09:03 - So, you know, I'm making this really nice
09:06 - and linearly structured for you guys,
09:08 - but in reality I was
probably on all 10 of them
09:12 - at the same time,
09:13 - and I feel like you might be
in that situation as well,
09:18 - and it can be frustrating.
09:20 - It can be a little bit
overwhelming as well,
09:23 - and sometimes with all of that going on,
09:26 - sometimes you just want to kind of quit.
09:29 - Or you're like, "I'll just
come back to it later,"
09:32 - and then you don't end
up coming back to it.
09:34 - So...
09:37 - This is the path that I'm offering you
09:39 - that you can actually just
take exactly what I did
09:42 - and learn all those skills.
09:45 - And then what I ended up
doing with those skills
09:46 - was I was getting work as
an independent contractor,
09:49 - so I was working and building
software for clients,
09:53 - and I was also working, you know,
09:56 - like giving personal coaching lessons.
09:59 - You can use that exact method
10:01 - to be generating pretty good income.
10:05 - I mean, as a college student,
10:07 - I think just last year between
the month of May and June
10:13 - I made over $20,000.
10:16 - Like, that's not bad as a 21 year old
10:18 - who's a full-time student
10:21 - and all this while I was
actually on a vacation.
10:24 - I went to California to visit my family,
10:26 - and my brother just had his son,
10:30 - so I went to see him,
and that was super cool.
10:33 - The little baby's adorable.
10:36 - But the work that I do
in software development
10:39 - will give you, also,
that kind of flexibility,
10:43 - so you can go wherever you want
10:45 - whether it's for vacations
10:47 - or whether you're going
out with your friends
10:49 - and just hanging out.
10:50 - You'll be able to do all those things.
10:54 - So what I've decided to do
10:55 - is take everything that
I've done so far, right,
11:00 - like all these 20, 30, 40 different places
11:03 - that I went to study programming from,
11:06 - all these different courses I've taken,
11:08 - all these soft skills
and negotiation skills
11:10 - that I've learned to be
able to work with clients
11:13 - so they're practically
forced to look at my resume
11:17 - and then hire me.
11:19 - All these different ways
of generating extra income,
11:24 - what I decided to do was take all of this
11:27 - and build a course that we
offer at Clever Programmer now.
11:32 - So this course right now
11:34 - is called Learn Python OOP Create Apps,
11:38 - so it teaches you about
object-oriented programming
11:42 - while you're creating apps
11:44 - that you can actually
put on your portfolio
11:48 - and go and get hired,
11:51 - so you're not just learning.
11:54 - This is giving you a real potential
11:56 - to actually be making money
too because let's be real.
11:59 - At the end of the day,
12:00 - yes, you're doing this
for fun or whatever,
12:03 - but at the end of the day,
12:05 - you're doing this to get paid, right?
12:08 - You're doing this so you can
pursue something that's fun
12:12 - but also so you can live
a comfortable lifestyle,
12:17 - so that's really what I
decided to do in this course,
12:19 - and then I also teach you this
12:22 - from the aspect of negotiation skills.
12:25 - Also, what else is in this
course is live sessions,
12:28 - so you and I might actually
be in a live session
12:32 - along with other students,
12:34 - and there's a private community built in
12:37 - so you can actually work
alongside other students
12:40 - just like yourself.
12:43 - So by the time you're watching this video,
12:45 - maybe this course is closed down
12:47 - because what I wanna do is I
wanna close this course down
12:50 - so then we can run this class,
12:51 - and I want my focus to be 100% on you.
12:54 - Right?
12:55 - I don't want to deviate
my attention anywhere.
12:58 - I want to make sure that
we're all focused, committed,
13:01 - and in this together, so by
the time you're watching this,
13:03 - the course may be closed down.
13:06 - But if you're watching this
when this video is made,
13:10 - you have three days to enroll,
13:13 - and then I'll probably relaunch it.
13:15 - I don't know when is the
next time I will do that,
13:17 - but you can click the link below,
13:20 - and you can click on the
waiting list and join that
13:25 - so then when it is available,
13:27 - you'll be the first one to know.
13:30 - All right, so thank you guys for watching.
13:32 - I love your faces off.
13:34 - That's it for this video.
13:36 - This is Qazi, and make sure
to subscribe to the channel
13:41 - if you're new, right?
13:42 - I love having everybody here.
13:46 - Also, make sure to like the video
13:48 - so everybody else can see it,
13:50 - and you can help them out
just by clicking that button.
13:53 - All right, thank you guys for watching,
13:55 - and I'll see you in the next video.
