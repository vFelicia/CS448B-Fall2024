00:00 - coding is not hard you are just weak
00:05 - that's a problem a lot of the
00:06 - people that are coming on this channel
00:08 - are talking to me they're like
00:11 - three months you can't get a job in six
00:14 - months I didn't invent coding boot camps
00:17 - they exist for a reason because people
00:20 - are doing that and getting jobs I didn't
00:22 - need a code of boot camp I did it by
00:24 - myself for free I had coaches I had
00:27 - coaches who helped but you can
00:29 - definitely do it most of you were don't
00:31 - have a job right now it's nobody else's
00:33 - fault but yours you are the reason why
00:37 - you don't have a job in an economy and
00:39 - in a country and in a place where
00:41 - there's zero excuse for you to have a
00:43 - job software developer if you have any
00:46 - level of skill people are desperate to
00:49 - give you money to become a software
00:51 - developer at their company but most of
00:53 - you are so goddamn bad as a developer
00:57 - that you can't get a job and nobody's
01:00 - gonna tell you that truth because
01:01 - everybody's too scared but that's the
01:03 - truth that's the reason why you're not
01:05 - getting a job you're literally just
01:07 - getting one client one person to just
01:10 - say one company that has an unlimited
01:12 - budget that just has to say yes I need
01:14 - you here's what's happening one you're
01:16 - really bad at coding that's one of the
01:19 - reasons why you're not getting a job
01:20 - second you're not trying hard enough
01:22 - most of you who don't have a job are
01:24 - sitting there and just waiting for a job
01:26 - to fall in your lap if you don't have a
01:27 - job you should be applying to places
01:29 - like it's your goddamn job 24 7 all day
01:32 - and not stopping the reason why you're
01:35 - not getting a job is because you're not
01:36 - applying somebody with half of a brain
01:39 - cell can get a job if they just
01:41 - attempted long enough and hard enough
01:43 - that would be a person somewhere they'll
01:45 - be like you know what this person is
01:47 - obsessive they seemed to be a fast
01:48 - learner and they really want this let me
01:51 - just give it to them you know why
01:53 - because I bet I could train this person
01:55 - and they could smoke that other
01:57 - developer that just wants to clock out
01:59 - go to their home and just do random
02:02 - stuff and not be growing whereas this
02:04 - person will literally kill themselves to
02:07 - improve I'm willing to give this person
02:08 - a chance and to those of you guys here's
02:11 - why it's happening and here's why it's
02:13 - so confusing for so many of you
02:15 - that are on this channel that I don't
02:16 - even want you here anymore there's some
02:18 - of you right not all of you the people
02:20 - who are supporting and are here I love
02:22 - you but there are a lot of people who
02:24 - are just like I don't understand how he
02:27 - did it it doesn't make any sense let me
02:29 - explain the reason why it's hurting your
02:32 - brain and how I was able to achieve a
02:35 - lot of those things in three months and
02:36 - being on a run rate of a hundred
02:37 - thousand dollars or more per year how at
02:40 - 20 or 21 years old I was able to quit
02:43 - out of college and my own Professor came
02:46 - up to me and asking me for career advice
02:48 - when I was taking computer science class
02:49 - everybody was watching my my coding
02:51 - tutorials on YouTube to pass the python
02:53 - course when that was happening I was
02:56 - like yeah maybe I should quit and pursue
02:58 - this goddamn thing and teach it to
03:00 - others because people do want to learn
03:01 - this and I can change their lives and
03:03 - there are a lot of people whose lives
03:04 - have been changed and then I'll grow a
03:06 - team and then we as a team went together
03:08 - and we started helping people and we
03:10 - started changing their lives and then I
03:12 - started doing something dumb and started
03:14 - watering my message down and trying to
03:16 - be super polite on social media and
03:18 - trying to be no what I'm doing by doing
03:21 - that is I'm not allowing you to rise up
03:24 - to a new level and become better become
03:27 - a better developer become a better human
03:28 - being and get a job of your dreams and
03:32 - live the life of your dreams what
03:33 - happened with me was no coincidence the
03:36 - reason why I had such a fire was because
03:38 - I grew up watching my mom in pain for
03:41 - years and years because we got in a car
03:43 - crash her L4 and L5 got got fractured
03:47 - which are your you know your your bones
03:48 - in your back
03:50 - she was in agony that led to her getting
03:52 - a lot of medical problems and I didn't
03:56 - want to be sitting there and watching
03:58 - her in agony and feeling helpless for
04:00 - the rest of my life and I'm like I have
04:01 - my whole family and nobody can really we
04:04 - can't support her with what we have and
04:06 - multiple of our people in in my you know
04:08 - my family had multiple jobs and we just
04:10 - couldn't support him we couldn't really
04:12 - do what she needed I remember going with
04:14 - my mom to Cook County Hospital in
04:15 - Chicago sitting there and waiting six
04:18 - hours at a time 10 hours at a time
04:20 - multiple times a week while I was 13 or
04:23 - 14 years old when you go through that I
04:25 - used to cry so much because my mom was
04:27 - in pain and just watching her in agony
04:29 - that I thought at some point that I
04:30 - would have died because I loved her more
04:32 - than anybody else in the world and to
04:34 - see somebody you love suffer every
04:35 -  day made me just want to like
04:38 - the pain was so much I couldn't live
04:41 - through it at some point I learned how
04:43 - to be calm in the face of that pain be
04:45 - there to support her be there to support
04:47 - everybody else in my family and I was
04:49 - like this there is a better way I'm
04:52 - going to learn how to get useful
04:55 - valuable skills so I can make money
04:57 - money is the reason why I started
05:00 - learning coding okay what kept me there
05:03 - was I ended up falling in love with
05:06 - coding and enjoying out of it so my fire
05:09 - is way different than a lot of you a lot
05:12 - of you are like
05:14 - three months this is not possible he's
05:17 - just lying you are projecting your own
05:20 - weakness and your shortcomings and
05:22 - limitations on me and it doesn't matter
05:24 - to me because those aren't my
05:26 - limitations and I became a goddamn beast
05:29 - at coding why because I would put in 15
05:31 - to 18 hours a day and I realize I was
05:34 - sitting there and I'm like could a lot
05:36 - of these people is this right was I was
05:39 - this not right like I it made me doubt
05:41 - myself and go back and think about my
05:43 - own coding journey and think man when I
05:45 - was when I was going through my coding
05:47 - Journey am I am I simplifying it more
05:50 - than than what the people need like am I
05:53 - am I making it sound too easy for people
05:55 - is it is it yeah and I thought about it
05:59 - and I'm like it was easy for me but
06:01 - maybe I'm not clarifying certain things
06:03 - right for me I was spending 15 to 17
06:06 - hours a day and it felt easy because I
06:08 - enjoyed it and I'm obsessive I'm an
06:10 - extremely fast learner and when I have
06:13 - belief I just go all in I know nothing
06:15 - but to go all in and I went all in and I
06:18 - became
06:19 - extremely good at it because that's all
06:22 - I did I obsessed take anybody for three
06:25 - months have them doing something for 15
06:26 - to 17 hours a day they will become
06:28 - incredibly good will they become the
06:30 - best in the world no because it takes
06:33 - more than that to become best in the
06:34 - world will they become um well they all
06:36 - of a sudden be equivalent of somebody
06:38 - who has a decade of experience no it's
06:40 - not what I'm saying but just understand
06:41 - why it happened for somebody like me in
06:44 - three to four months and why could
06:46 - happen for you but the the difference
06:48 - isn't you're not gonna put in your one
06:50 - hour a day coming back from your nursing
06:53 - job or from your truck driving job or
06:55 - from your it job some of you who don't
06:57 - even have a job you're not gonna
06:59 - come back from whatever you were doing
07:01 - tired exhausted and just I'm gonna put
07:04 - it one hour a day consistency is the way
07:07 - to go all the best people in the world
07:09 - are consistent no nobody who was the
07:12 - best in the world did it through
07:13 - consistency did did it through being
07:15 - relentless obsessive and going harder
07:19 - than anybody else in the world like Kobe
07:22 - wasn't just like I'm gonna come in yeah
07:24 - I'll just come in from 9am to nine uh 10
07:26 - a.m just follow the training that my
07:28 - coach teaches me no Kobe was coming in 3
07:31 - A.M 3 30 a.m 4 AM whatever is an insane
07:34 - time ungodly hour training before
07:36 - anybody else was there there's stories
07:38 - about people being
07:40 - scared when they would see Kobe Bryant
07:42 - they'd be like I didn't even know he was
07:43 - in the locker room and and they were
07:45 - they were there so understand that the
07:48 - people who are winning in life the
07:50 - people who you want to emulate they're
07:52 - obsessed consistency is not Obsession
07:54 - okay let me let me say it like this if
07:57 - you want average results and you're okay
08:00 - with that just want to have mediocre
08:01 - results have a job that pays you 60k
08:03 - I've just work-life balance and I need
08:07 - to be able to go home and just relax and
08:09 - shut everything off at four or five PM
08:11 - great all of those of you I'm literally
08:14 - not talking to any of you because I
08:17 - don't care I don't know what that life
08:18 - is like for many years I try to
08:20 - assimilate myself with that crowd I
08:23 - don't know what that's like if you can
08:25 - do that and spend a lot of time it
08:27 - doesn't have to 15 hours a day but like
08:28 - when you sit down and code just immerse
08:31 - yourself in it and just do it like enjoy
08:34 - it build a thing that you want to build
08:36 - try at least like give it a try all of
08:40 - the reasons that I've had extreme
08:41 - results right all these
08:43 - YouTubers online that have coding
08:44 - channels I don't know what they're doing
08:46 - but like at 25 I became a millionaire
08:48 - like I learned coding I started making
08:50 - six figures and started teaching that I
08:52 - became a millionaire once I started my
08:54 - coding channels all of these things are
08:57 - results of obsessing and just being the
08:59 - best at what you do not everybody's
09:01 - getting these results but not
09:03 - everybody's as obsessed I had a mansion
09:05 - in Beverly Hills where my whole team was
09:07 - I have a girlfriend that's like the most
09:09 - beautiful girl her Talent is amazing her
09:12 - Integrity amazing she's loyalists like
09:15 - she's killing it in life in every area
09:17 - she's a pro boxer
09:18 - pro athlete synchronized swimmer now
09:21 - she's on TV everywhere but what I'm
09:23 - telling you is all of these areas
09:25 - they're crafted in an exceptional way
09:27 - because I have an extremely high set of
09:29 - Standards now I have a epic ass place in
09:32 - La I'm about to get another place in
09:34 - Colombia I'm about to fly my entire team
09:37 - out there and we're and and we're going
09:40 - to be creating amazing content on this
09:42 - channel and I'm gonna start building
09:43 - multiple other brands on their personal
09:45 - brand because I want to achieve
09:47 - more and I want to Excel and I just want
09:48 - to be the best at what I do and I want
09:50 - to give it my best because I wouldn't
09:52 - serve you if I didn't if I wasn't at my
09:55 - best if I'm scared and I'm weak and I'm
09:57 - not doing the that I want to do so
09:59 - now I'm committed to doing this that is
10:02 - a crazy challenge for me every day and I
10:05 - want to go for exceptional results the
10:08 - reason I'm telling you this is not to
10:09 - brag but it's just to make it super
10:12 - clear if you want to get these results
10:15 - understand and have the right
10:16 - expectations every day every live living
10:19 - eating breathing moment was session it
10:22 - was watching the learning from
10:25 - the people surrounding myself with
10:26 - coding friends coding mentors anybody
10:29 - and everybody that could help me every
10:31 - dollar I made from coding I went on code
10:32 - mentor and paid it right back so
10:34 - somebody could teach me coding if I made
10:36 - a hundred dollars I spent eighty dollars
10:38 - on somebody to coach me because I knew I
10:40 - was gonna spend that money on some dump
10:42 - anyway a car a watch or whatever but
10:44 - those things are liabilities I'd
10:46 - rather invest in myself as Alex hermosi
10:49 - says not SMP but SM mean SN me 500 which
10:55 - is an investment in yourself instead of
10:57 - taking the excess cash you have and
10:58 - putting into the S P 500 I want you to
11:00 - put it into the sne 500 take that 500
11:03 - every single month and you plowed into
11:04 - you so I looked at life like that and I
11:07 - was just like yo let me just keep
11:08 - reinvesting into my skill set and go
11:11 - absolutely ham relentlessly investing
11:15 - into my own skill set and when I did
11:17 - that my skill sets started skyrocketing
11:20 - every dollar I made I poured it back
11:22 - into me to either improve my speaking
11:24 - skills or my coding skills and I just
11:27 - became better so I was investing time
11:29 - money energy everything that I had into
11:32 - that one goal and then I achieved it way
11:34 - faster than a lot of people that I know
11:37 - geez yeah
11:39 - um be realistic coffee that's one of the
11:41 - things I've got in my whole life and
11:42 - it's just as you can tell I don't like
11:45 - it I love you I want to just give you
11:46 - this message I hope it inspires you I
11:48 - hope that it drives you to do more be
11:51 - more and get more and do it for not just
11:54 - yourself all these selfish little wimps
11:57 - online the reason why a lot of you are
12:00 - just doing just like is this right like
12:03 - so much of it is for just you that's why
12:06 - you can't give it that much effort
12:08 - either honestly right um a lot of people
12:11 - are just okay with just achieving a
12:13 - certain amount whatever
12:15 - I broke me not for me but I don't care
12:18 - as long as it inspires one person that
12:21 - is it
