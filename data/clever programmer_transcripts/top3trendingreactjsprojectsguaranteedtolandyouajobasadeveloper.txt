09:28 - let's just jump straight into some value
09:30 - today and let's go ahead and run with
09:32 - this
09:32 - i've got a bunch of things i want to go
09:34 - through today and pretty much
09:36 - the first thing i want to say guys is
09:37 - that if you haven't already got a
09:39 - portfolio what are you doing
09:41 - like you guys need like a portfolio is
09:42 - going to stand you out
09:44 - from the rest of the other developers so
09:46 - most people have a cv or a resume
09:48 - and we've all seen it guys we've all
09:49 - seen let me just get a let me let me get
09:51 - a simple sort of resume that we see that
09:54 - has comes up so we've all seen the
09:55 - typical
09:56 - kind of resume that everyone's talking
09:58 - about something like this right
10:00 - you're gonna have someone that comes up
10:02 - and they've they're going to drop this
10:03 - on the table
10:04 - and guys i'm telling you like i've been
10:06 - in the recruitment side of this where
10:08 - literally you
10:08 - we would look through it and we'll be
10:09 - like right let's see who this person is
10:11 - and guys
10:12 - imagine how many of these gets pushed
10:14 - across the desk
10:16 - every single day when someone's when a
10:19 - company is hiring or recruiting
10:21 - you pretty much again they're going to
10:22 - see this all the time all i can see at
10:24 - this point is just text i mean
10:25 - most of us quite like we wouldn't even
10:27 - like take the time out to sort of read
10:28 - this too much like
10:30 - so but instead if you saw one
10:33 - badass portfolio built in react deployed
10:37 - in firebase
10:38 - even has some redux attached to it then
10:40 - that's going to take my attention so
10:42 - let's go ahead and actually do a quick
10:43 - google search right now and let's go
10:44 - ahead and type in
10:46 - let's go ahead and check react developer
10:48 - portfolios and let's see if i can
10:49 - actually give you guys a live demo
10:51 - of some amazing portfolios that are out
10:53 - there right now
10:55 - um and also i saw a question uh earlier
10:57 - and a really good question actually
10:58 - and that's why like why should we have a
11:01 - portfolio and why
11:02 - like why should we learn react i see
11:04 - that question pop up quite a lot
11:06 - and guys the one thing i will say to you
11:08 - guys is if you
11:09 - are on the fence of learning react here
11:12 - is something which
11:13 - may change your mind so this is the
11:15 - average base salary of a developer guys
11:18 - in the states so a hundred and eighteen
11:21 - thousand dollars just just let that
11:24 - let that sink in for a second guys 118
11:28 - thousand dollars if that impresses you
11:30 - guys smash the like button because
11:32 - literally
11:32 - in this in these live streams and in
11:34 - these sort of live sessions
11:35 - we're going to take you to points where
11:37 - you can start learning and you can get
11:39 - on your journey to earning that salary
11:41 - guys and it's completely
11:43 - something which is not is not like
11:46 - mind-blowing like out of
11:48 - it's something which is not uh
11:49 - unfeasible and it's definitely something
11:51 - which you can
11:52 - you can achieve if you just put the work
11:53 - in um
11:55 - so awesome guys so like we said before
11:58 - we jump in we are going to be
11:59 - talking about apps like netflix like
12:02 - amazon
12:03 - and like the facebook messenger that we
12:05 - built okay and why
12:07 - you need these in your portfolio so
12:09 - without further ado guys let's jump
12:11 - straight in so i'm going to go ahead and
12:13 - open up a whiteboard so that you guys
12:14 - can actually get
12:16 - you guys can actually see a little bit
12:18 - clearer and before
12:19 - uh let's see if there's any interesting
12:21 - questions guys
12:22 - so we have uh elijah says
12:26 - okay this is a good point how many hours
12:28 - should a solid
12:29 - portfolio uh let's go ahead and put this
12:31 - on the background there we go
12:33 - how many hours should a solid
12:36 - portfolio project take and what is an
12:38 - optimal amount of these projects you
12:40 - should have
12:41 - a junior as a junior level so as a
12:43 - junior developer
12:45 - very good question um what i will say to
12:47 - that elijah is that
12:49 - and also i saw you in yesterday's live
12:51 - stream so amazing to see you here again
12:53 - um what i will say to that guys is
12:56 - honestly one there is no uh maximum cap
13:00 - if you can put more hours in
13:02 - put more hours in okay like put the put
13:04 - the time in because it's going to make
13:07 - the difference when it comes to like if
13:09 - if there's 10 developers applying for a
13:11 - job
13:11 - and you really took that love and
13:13 - consideration and put that
13:15 - time and effort into your portfolio
13:16 - that's going to show when it comes to
13:18 - that having that interview and even if
13:21 - your portfolio isn't that powerful guys
13:23 - the stories that you will have to share
13:26 - when you're debugging and doing all of
13:27 - that stuff
13:28 - that's going to actually be something to
13:31 - talk about with the person that's
13:32 - interviewing you and i guarantee that
13:33 - that's where you can relate quite a lot
13:34 - and get on
13:35 - so um what is an optimal amount of these
13:37 - projects to have at junior level
13:39 - honestly guys
13:40 - if you have three amazing amazing uh
13:43 - projects uh just like the ones that we
13:45 - demoed right here
13:46 - so literally like a messenger app and
13:48 - guys let's just quickly go through some
13:50 - of the functionalities on these apps
13:51 - so here we have a real-time database
13:54 - integration so literally
13:55 - we have smooth animation so like wow
13:58 - this
13:58 - actually works guys and also guys if you
14:01 - don't
14:02 - if you don't want to take it take my
14:03 - word for this go ahead and check the
14:05 - comment section
14:06 - right now i've dropped the netflix link
14:09 - so i've dropped the links to these two
14:10 - apps guys
14:11 - the netflix app uh over this one so you
14:13 - can go ahead and play it if i go ahead
14:15 - and click the
14:16 - dark trailer right here it goes ahead
14:18 - and plays a trailer
14:20 - which is awesome right so you'll play
14:22 - the trailer for that one
14:23 - and over here guys you can go ahead and
14:25 - actually check these out right now add a
14:26 - couple of items to your basket
14:28 - you can pretty much go ahead and you can
14:30 - mess around with this guys you can try
14:31 - and break it
14:33 - uh if you go ahead and sign in you can
14:35 - actually create an amazon account and if
14:36 - we leave the fields blank you see it
14:37 - even has some
14:39 - validation and things like that so this
14:41 - all works and you can even sign in and
14:43 - actually signs you into the
14:44 - uh to the thing so we're gonna look a
14:46 - bit more into that but to answer to go
14:48 - back to elijah's question guys
14:50 - three solid projects which demonstrate
14:54 - a variety of skills is going to be
14:58 - really really like honestly especially
15:00 - at a junior level that
15:01 - in my opinion is going to be enough to
15:03 - guarantee you a position
15:05 - at that point three solid projects plus
15:08 - some really good soft skills
15:09 - that is going to be enough to get you in
15:11 - into your first
15:12 - job uh and that is going to be more
15:14 - valuable honesty and guys
15:16 - i say this with absolutely i i don't
15:19 - stress i can't stress this enough
15:21 - yeah that like i came from a background
15:23 - of having a degree and having a masters
15:25 - i can't stress enough if somebody just
15:27 - like if if i could
15:28 - rewind that time and just invest in
15:31 - practical projects like these ones
15:33 - so literally like these kind of apps i
15:35 - literally would have done that and made
15:37 - such an amazing portfolio
15:39 - to demonstrate as opposed to just saying
15:41 - hey i have a degree
15:42 - because literally most developers now
15:44 - would have a degree but you know what
15:46 - the truth is it really doesn't matter
15:47 - anymore about age
15:48 - you're never too young you're never too
15:50 - old to start coding um
15:52 - so yeah like honestly a portfolio in
15:54 - that case three
15:55 - solid apps like the ones i just
15:57 - demonstrated are going to be more than
15:58 - enough guys and we will go into depth as
16:00 - to why
16:01 - um very shortly um so this quick run
16:04 - through of the questions
16:06 - um so let's go ahead and have a look so
16:10 - we have sunny what else do you usually
16:11 - use as a back-end system for react
16:13 - besides firebase
16:14 - very good question um you can use
16:16 - node.js you can use any language really
16:18 - as a back-end um
16:19 - you can use python as back and you can
16:21 - just java as a backend um
16:23 - but yeah you can pretty much uh you can
16:25 - mix and match when it comes to react
16:26 - react is more of a front end
16:28 - and so the back end can be powered by
16:30 - whatever you want it to be powered by
16:32 - um let's go ahead and say okay but where
16:35 - can we find our first jobs
16:37 - like freelancing websites or look for
16:38 - jobs on companies websites
16:40 - very good question very good question
16:42 - and actually
16:43 - what i would recommend is if you are if
16:45 - anyone is interested in this question
16:47 - we have two videos guys that answer this
16:49 - exact question
16:50 - and we're going to full depth on these
16:52 - videos one is yesterday
16:54 - yesterday's live session with me and
16:56 - nars on how to make um
16:58 - i think what was yesterday's live
16:59 - session go ahead and check it out
17:01 - in in the youtube channel uh yesterday's
17:03 - session we're going to uh we're going to
17:04 - a complete talk about all of this stuff
17:06 - and also last friday me and qazi did a
17:09 - um
17:10 - did a live stream about ways to make
17:12 - money
17:13 - um as a react developer so we actually
17:15 - broke this down
17:16 - completely i even shared my backstory as
17:19 - to how i became a developer so if any of
17:20 - you guys are interested in that
17:22 - definitely go ahead and go and give that
17:24 - a check and go and see what that is
17:26 - about
17:27 - and um yeah if you if you're asking this
17:29 - question i guarantee you'll find that
17:31 - pretty useful so
17:32 - be sure to check that out you hack nice
17:35 - uh okay so guys let's jump straight in
17:37 - because uh let's just go ahead and let's
17:39 - just give some more value here so
17:41 - uh so what i'm going to tell you guys is
17:43 - that the reason why
17:45 - you want a portfolio like this and the
17:47 - reason why you want a portfolio that
17:49 - demonstrates things like this
17:51 - um well let's go ahead and put this page
17:52 - up because that's a little bit nicer
17:54 - the reason why you want this guys is
17:56 - because it does
17:57 - all of the talking for you right it
18:00 - tells and
18:01 - like a senior developer or the person
18:03 - hiring you it tells them
18:05 - that this is my skill set and here is
18:08 - proof
18:08 - like rather than me telling you i could
18:10 - sit here and tell you that i can do this
18:12 - i can do that i can do this but you know
18:13 - what the minute you guys believed me
18:15 - was when i started to actually code and
18:17 - i started to show you and i started to
18:18 - actually present like all of these
18:20 - projects and things like that
18:21 - then you actually trusted that i could
18:23 - that i could actually
18:24 - um code in react right so it's the same
18:27 - with uh it's the same with
18:28 - an employer or a freelancing client or
18:31 - somebody that you're about to teach you
18:32 - have to earn their trust
18:34 - and you earn their trust the minute they
18:35 - start seeing apps like this and they're
18:37 - like whoa like that's actually
18:38 - is that the real netflix or is that like
18:40 - the fake one or like is that your clone
18:42 - and when you start showing like dynamic
18:44 - apps like this like and guys this is all
18:46 - people who were in the last live stream
18:48 - and they went ahead and just jumped onto
18:49 - this and everything just popped through
18:51 - here
18:52 - and just to show you guys how dynamic
18:54 - this really is
18:55 - if i was to open this up in another tab
18:57 - so let's go ahead and do that right now
18:59 - let's go ahead and do this right now so
19:01 - you can say and let's just say i was
19:02 - quasi at this point
19:04 - and it says welcome kazi and i was like
19:06 - yo sonny
19:08 - look at this guys you see that it's a
19:10 - real-time messaging app right now
19:12 - so like if you can sit there with an
19:14 - employer
19:15 - and show them this this will like guys
19:18 - at this point they're going to be like
19:19 - what the what what is going on like
19:21 - they're going to be like
19:22 - how did you build that it's gonna spark
19:24 - a conversation right and that's gonna
19:26 - get them interested and it's gonna show
19:27 - them
19:28 - like that you have actually got the
19:29 - skills to build something like this and
19:31 - pull it off
19:32 - right nice we should have a lot of
19:35 - people coming in now okay awesome
19:37 - so um yeah guys so what we want to talk
19:39 - about is pretty much like
19:40 - how these kind of projects can actually
19:44 - demonstrate your skill set
19:45 - and do all of the speaking for you like
19:47 - guys nobody wants to sit there and talk
19:48 - about
19:49 - like or listing out and guys that's my
19:50 - main thing okay
19:52 - like so let's actually go ahead and pull
19:54 - up a whiteboard right now
19:55 - so one thing i absolutely hated
19:59 - right is that when i would uh i would
20:02 - interview somebody applying for a job
20:03 - okay so i was actually working at a
20:05 - staff company
20:06 - i was interviewing people that were
20:06 - coming in for jobs so junior developers
20:08 - they would come in to the position
20:10 - and then they would do the following
20:12 - right so i don't know if you guys if you
20:13 - guys can see this
20:14 - let me know um in the comment section
20:17 - and i will
20:18 - because my screen completely goes white
20:19 - when i do this so i i used to see this
20:22 - right they would come in
20:23 - and they would list out a bunch of
20:25 - things right so they would list out
20:26 - they would just simply do the following
20:29 - let me go ahead and make this a little
20:30 - bit bigger guys
20:31 - so they would do this and this is
20:34 - something that you don't want to do
20:35 - so things you
20:38 - oops okay let's do let's go ahead and
20:41 - just
20:41 - say things you
20:45 - do not want to do in
20:48 - an interview okay and this is like in an
20:51 - interview or like when or in your
20:53 - interview or a portfolio
20:55 - so in an interview or port folio
20:58 - okay things you do not want to do in a
21:00 - portfolio and then guys it's just things
21:02 - that
21:03 - they're just like those those things you
21:04 - just you stay away from them okay don't
21:06 - do it
21:07 - so the first one i'm gonna say is pretty
21:09 - much a case of
21:11 - do not list so don't
21:14 - list out skills
21:17 - okay we see everyone does it i guarantee
21:19 - some of us right now
21:21 - have a portfolio somewhere where like
21:24 - we have a bunch of skills where it says
21:26 - hey i know how to use react i know how
21:28 - to use redux i know how to use flexbox i
21:30 - know how to use this and that
21:31 - guys don't do it because honestly like
21:34 - everyone does it and you need to be able
21:36 - to stand out from the crowd
21:37 - and this is going to be something which
21:39 - like it's not it's going to do a lot
21:40 - more damage than
21:42 - as opposed to what you think it's going
21:43 - to be doing another thing i would say is
21:45 - don't do is do
21:46 - not simply copy code
21:50 - okay the reason why i say this guys this
21:52 - is very
21:53 - important this one don't just simply
21:55 - copy code
21:56 - when you start copying code guys it
21:58 - becomes a
22:00 - yes okay look you might have a portfolio
22:02 - of like 10 different apps
22:03 - but one it's so easy especially like a
22:07 - medium or senior developer when they
22:08 - look at that
22:09 - so easy to quickly distinguish because
22:11 - all i would do at that point
22:13 - is i would just start throwing a sort of
22:15 - technical question
22:16 - i'll say okay like how did you approach
22:18 - how did you approach the database in the
22:20 - end that and then pretty much you would
22:21 - start to notice the cracks very quickly
22:23 - so you're better off having three apps
22:25 - so just three apps that you know
22:26 - extremely well rather than having
22:30 - a bunch of apps that you uh that you
22:32 - don't really know much about
22:33 - okay so don't list out skills do not
22:35 - simply copy code
22:36 - and guys this is my number one advice
22:39 - like uh
22:40 - honestly and it's even in an interview
22:42 - or if you're learning from somebody
22:44 - ask actually no that's that's something
22:46 - you should do
22:47 - um don't stay quiet this is my own
22:51 - little
22:52 - feedback and this one's a bit
22:52 - controversial guys don't stay quiet and
22:54 - what i mean by this
22:55 - i'm saying just ask questions this
22:57 - doesn't mean like whenever you're in an
22:58 - interview
22:59 - or like if you're in a reddit or a
23:02 - any kind of community guys speak up and
23:05 - the reason why i say this is because in
23:07 - interviews in portfolio like in
23:09 - portfolios
23:10 - i see too many like very like quiet and
23:12 - they want to keep everything like very
23:13 - neat and concise and the thing is guys
23:15 - you need to just you need to show your
23:17 - skill set you need to be able to ask the
23:18 - questions and not be afraid to ask
23:20 - the things that people are going to be
23:22 - typically afraid of so
23:23 - with that said guys the main two that i
23:25 - want to focus on right now
23:27 - is do not oops let's go ahead and do
23:29 - this so
23:30 - do what is that okay so let's go ahead
23:32 - and
23:33 - do not list out skills okay like do not
23:36 - do it okay
23:37 - i don't want to see like a list where
23:39 - you've got like uh
23:41 - okay so i know how to use a react so
23:43 - let's go ahead and do
23:44 - react so that's on my list now and i
23:45 - know how to use like redux and that's on
23:48 - my list now like
23:49 - stop doing that do not do that guys like
23:51 - just
23:52 - big no no okay and literally and this
23:54 - one do not simply copy code
23:57 - because literally this is the easiest
23:59 - thing
24:00 - this is by far the easiest thing to spot
24:02 - so definitely don't do that and guys
24:04 - just always ask questions always ask
24:06 - questions it's going to get you ahead
24:08 - don't stay quiet and i mean like do not
24:10 - stay quiet even inside your portfolio
24:12 - make that thing beautiful make that
24:14 - thing stand out make that thing look
24:16 - like it's just screaming that you want
24:18 - the job that you are proud of what you
24:20 - have built
24:21 - i see too many things like template
24:22 - portfolios and templates or
24:24 - cvs and guys just it just doesn't make
24:26 - you stand out from the rest of the crowd
24:28 - so with that said let's jump back into
24:32 - the code so guys if you guys
24:35 - are enjoying this so far as well please
24:37 - please please
24:38 - just feel free to smash the thumbs up
24:40 - button and let us know if this is
24:42 - actually useful to you guys and you guys
24:43 - are finding this helpful right now
24:45 - because that will help us figure out if
24:48 - we should keep doing this you know like
24:49 - i can
24:50 - a lot of you guys are showing us that
24:51 - you love this and that you're enjoying
24:53 - these live sessions
24:54 - so i want to see guys smash the thumbs
24:57 - up button it will help the video
24:58 - reach more people and it will help them
25:00 - actually sort of help this video be
25:02 - beneficial to more
25:03 - people and hopefully we can help as many
25:05 - people as we possibly can
25:06 - so let's go ahead and have a look at
25:08 - some questions
25:10 - um right now so i have completed
25:13 - projects but is it okay to use a
25:15 - template
25:15 - for my portfolio website good question
25:18 - um so yeah there is not like i said guys
25:20 - there's actually there's nothing wrong
25:21 - with using a portfolio
25:23 - a template for your portfolio website
25:25 - but you want to
25:27 - kind of steer away from it like it's
25:29 - just straight off the bat
25:30 - looking like a uh like a template
25:33 - because the problem is guys it's like a
25:34 - resume right
25:35 - like we looked at a resume earlier and
25:37 - look look at this guys
25:38 - if you saw a resume like this right now
25:41 - this is the same thing
25:42 - it doesn't matter if it's a piece of
25:44 - paper or website that we've all seen
25:46 - this before we've all seen this before
25:48 - and the minute you see it guys
25:50 - i mean this doesn't like spark any sort
25:52 - of like fireworks off in my head when i
25:54 - see this
25:55 - i'm just kind of like um this person is
25:58 - just another kind of average joe you
26:00 - know
26:01 - like they're not going to be the person
26:02 - that's going to deserve a salary
26:04 - like 118 000 a year right
26:08 - so you really really i would recommend
26:10 - that there's nothing wrong
26:12 - with starting off with a template a
26:13 - template is better than having no
26:15 - uh a portfolio so i would definitely
26:17 - start if it means
26:19 - getting a template's gonna help you get
26:20 - started then i would definitely go ahead
26:22 - and do that
26:23 - but definitely try to make that thing
26:27 - look as custom as personalized as
26:29 - possible okay
26:30 - and really really try and harness your
26:32 - skill set so that you're able to do that
26:34 - now let's go ahead and check some more
26:36 - so
26:38 - um i just saw a really good question but
26:40 - it just slipped my
26:41 - uh my screen so let's see
26:44 - i have created to do a netflix con and
26:46 - amazon clone as well from your live
26:48 - stream thank you guys oh amazing
26:50 - amazing to see that ashish um nice i
26:53 - love to see when you guys are actually
26:54 - following these live streams day to day
26:56 - so
26:56 - if you're enjoying that yeah smash the
26:58 - thumbs up button and let us know
26:59 - um thanks for answers sunny you are true
27:03 - legend thank you so much
27:05 - how can we build a good website okay
27:06 - this is a good question
27:08 - how can we build a good website without
27:10 - back-end development
27:11 - so i'm gonna answer this in one simple
27:14 - way guys
27:15 - so the question here is how can we build
27:18 - a website without back in development do
27:21 - you know a secret guys
27:23 - these three websites right here so we
27:26 - have
27:26 - the messenger app we have the
27:30 - netflix app and we have the amazon app
27:35 - when you use firebase guys little little
27:37 - tip for you guys
27:38 - you actually don't need to do much
27:39 - back-end development so this is like
27:42 - literally in these projects when i we
27:44 - didn't actually do any back-end
27:45 - development really
27:46 - like this was all front end everything
27:47 - was react it was all front end
27:49 - um when you have things like amazon now
27:52 - you're probably wondering yeah but like
27:53 - sunny how did you handle the
27:54 - authentication like how am i going to
27:56 - create an account here
27:57 - guys check this out if i just go ahead
27:59 - and create a dummy account so let's just
28:01 - go ahead sony dummy
28:02 - gmail.com maybe and then go ahead and
28:05 - create your amazon account
28:07 - boom look at that hello and it signed me
28:10 - in and i'm
28:11 - already inside my account i can carry on
28:13 - using the app everything seems to work
28:15 - and it's all good
28:16 - right now guys and look guys notice how
28:19 - the navbar actually sticks to the top if
28:20 - you want to know that go check that
28:22 - video out
28:23 - um yeah so notice how guys
28:26 - this was all react.js so this was all
28:28 - front-end development
28:30 - okay and the beauty here and this is why
28:33 - like i really really am trying to push
28:35 - this in these calls
28:36 - is that when you start using firebase so
28:38 - firebase for many of you guys who don't
28:40 - know what firebase is
28:41 - is a suite of tools by google and i'm
28:43 - going to go through that in a second and
28:45 - sort of give you a demonstration as to
28:46 - what you can do with it
28:47 - and basically in firebase guys you have
28:50 - access to a
28:51 - bunch of useful things so you have
28:54 - authentication you have databases you
28:56 - have storage you have hosting
28:58 - like hosting so that's the that's
29:00 - literally how i've hosted the websites
29:02 - that you guys are looking at on the
29:03 - screen right now
29:04 - um storage if you guys didn't check it
29:06 - out before we also made a net
29:09 - an instagram app so that's literally an
29:11 - example of where we use this
29:13 - we have the real-time database so when
29:14 - you guys saw the
29:17 - to-do app so um not the to-do yeah the
29:19 - to-do app or
29:20 - the messenger app that was using the
29:22 - real-time database in firebase
29:24 - and to handle the authentication that i
29:26 - just demonstrated right here so even
29:27 - when i click sign out guys watch this
29:29 - it doesn't even refresh that's how good
29:31 - react is look boom
29:33 - dynamic no refreshing no nothing and
29:35 - literally that just used
29:37 - the authentication on firebase and guys
29:39 - it worked it got everything set up and
29:41 - guys look at this you can even do
29:42 - machine learning
29:43 - so if you're able to demonstrate this
29:45 - let's go ahead and zoom in if you're
29:46 - able to demonstrate this
29:48 - um that you can use all of these skills
29:50 - then it's going to make you stand out
29:52 - okay so that's why i would recommend um
29:56 - yeah so
29:56 - to answer your question um you don't
29:58 - actually need to know a lot of back-end
30:00 - development so i would actually
30:02 - for those of you who are wondering on
30:03 - like should i go into backhand should i
30:05 - go into front-end what should i really
30:06 - do sunny
30:07 - like focus on one area guys and if my my
30:10 - honest advice would be to focus
30:12 - on front-end development if you're new
30:14 - to development because it's fun
30:16 - it's quirky you can build cool websites
30:18 - um like the ones i've shown here you can
30:20 - build these kind of
30:21 - sites and get them up and running and um
30:24 - yeah you're going to get a lot more sort
30:25 - of
30:25 - immediate of a immediate response when
30:28 - you demonstrate these things as opposed
30:30 - to showing
30:30 - a little like a massive kind of
30:32 - algorithm that you wrote and then it
30:33 - just logs out a little line of code at
30:35 - the end
30:35 - i mean what are you going to find more
30:37 - interesting looking at an app like this
30:39 - or like a little console log at the end
30:41 - so that's why i would definitely go
30:42 - ahead with this
30:44 - so let's have a look um
30:47 - okay so it's freelancing a good start i
30:49 - will answer those questions i'm going to
30:51 - save those ones to the end
30:52 - i think right now let's actually carry
30:54 - on with the um
30:56 - the reason so there's three trending
30:57 - react projects and for those of you who
30:59 - are new so i can see we've actually got
31:01 - 100 more people that have joined the
31:02 - live stream
31:03 - today we are talking about the top three
31:06 - trending react js projects uh guaranteed
31:09 - to land you a job as a developer
31:12 - right so the why you should definitely
31:14 - have

34:43 - can actually really start to help you
34:44 - out
34:45 - so somebody asked on facebook it doesn't
34:46 - actually show the name but it says
34:48 - please where can i start as a first
34:49 - beginner
34:50 - very good question um i'd love to see
34:53 - who that was but for some reason
34:54 - facebook isn't showing us who that is
34:56 - so guys uh literally
35:00 - if you are new to coding and you want to
35:02 - get involved in it
35:03 - i'm going to quickly explain something
35:05 - before we actually carry on
35:07 - so the first thing i'm going to talk
35:08 - about is if you are new to coding guys
35:10 - what we cover in these talks right now
35:12 - is web development okay we cover web
35:14 - development
35:15 - and basically what we have in web
35:17 - development is it's very simple guys
35:19 - okay
35:19 - we have so i'm just going to put up a
35:20 - whiteboard here we have html
35:23 - okay so we have html so that's the one
35:26 - fundamental we have html we have
35:28 - css and we have javascript okay
35:32 - so we have html we have css and we have
35:34 - javascript now
35:36 - javascript so html is literally what
35:38 - you're going to have on the web page so
35:39 - it's going to be
35:40 - ever this is like the web page and then
35:42 - html is literally everything you see on
35:44 - the web page that is like
35:45 - how it's laid out how where you put an
35:47 - image how things are laid out but
35:49 - html by itself is ugly guys okay it
35:51 - looks like ugly i mean
35:53 - by itself it's not very pretty so we
35:55 - need
35:56 - some css css is how we make things look
35:59 - beautiful guys
36:00 - it's how we get apps looking really
36:02 - pretty it's how we get netflix looking
36:04 - like netflix
36:05 - it's how we pretty much got this app
36:07 - over here looking like the way it does
36:09 - right
36:10 - so that's um pretty much where we get
36:12 - that from
36:13 - now that is where css comes in so that's
36:16 - where you add a style sheet to your app
36:18 - but if we're just these two we have a
36:20 - very like kind of like a dumb
36:22 - application i like to call it
36:23 - and that is where javascript comes in
36:26 - guys
36:26 - so javascript is essentially the brains
36:29 - okay so it's where it's where the light
36:31 - bulb kicks in okay
36:33 - and this is literally where you're gonna
36:35 - have uh all of your clever stuff
36:37 - happening guys so
36:38 - everything that you see that happens
36:40 - clever for example even how i'm drawing
36:42 - on this page right now
36:44 - um is a is built is running on
36:46 - javascript right now so
36:48 - everything that you do which involves
36:50 - any kind of interaction or any
36:51 - sort of thing fancy how you guys are
36:53 - watching the live stream right now
36:54 - is through javascript okay now all of
36:57 - this
36:58 - so this is where react comes in so these
37:00 - three things are very very powerful okay
37:02 - but they have limitations you can only
37:03 - do so much with it so
37:05 - what the guys over at facebook did is
37:07 - they kind of grabbed this and they
37:09 - wrapped it
37:10 - in something uh in a lot and they used a
37:12 - they created a library
37:14 - called react okay many of you guys know
37:16 - it as react
37:18 - js so react js okay
37:21 - and now what this allows you to do is it
37:23 - allows you to build
37:24 - a very powerful single page app so we
37:28 - know them as
37:29 - spa apps okay so single page apps and
37:32 - guys
37:32 - this is where the money comes in okay so
37:35 - single page apps are
37:37 - extremely powerful and just to give you
37:39 - some examples of some apps
37:41 - so we have the likes of um
37:45 - so we have instagram so we have
37:47 - instagram we have tinder we have uber
37:49 - all of these apps guys uh use use react
37:53 - behind them and and they power them if
37:56 - you are on facebook so those of you
37:57 - watching on facebook
37:59 - know that facebook created reacts so
38:01 - they actually just recently rewrote the
38:03 - entire facebook
38:04 - code base in react okay somebody asked a
38:07 - good question so yeah so
38:08 - let's go ahead and finish this question
38:10 - first so please where can i start as a
38:12 - first beginner so
38:13 - just so you know that
38:16 - the reason why i was demonstrating that
38:18 - guys is that this is where you're gonna
38:20 - start as a beginner right i would
38:21 - recommend
38:22 - that you essentially focus on learning
38:24 - um oops let's go ahead and get rid of
38:26 - that so
38:27 - this you wanna focus on learning these
38:30 - things okay so you want to focus on
38:31 - learning
38:32 - um oops let's go ahead and undo that so
38:35 - you're going to focus on learning
38:36 - html you want to focus on learning css
38:39 - and you want to focus on learning
38:41 - javascript okay so these
38:43 - three things are where you need to be
38:45 - putting your time in
38:46 - so there are plenty of tutorials online
38:49 - um
38:49 - there are plenty of resources online i
38:52 - would use w3 school stack overflow those
38:54 - sort of things
38:55 - but you're only going to go so far right
38:57 - so you're going to hit an
38:58 - eventual sort of position where like
39:00 - you're like ah
39:02 - i'm kind of in tutorial hell and i don't
39:03 - really know where to go and then you're
39:04 - going to look at react and you're just
39:06 - going to be scared to start react okay
39:08 - and now we've all run into this problem
39:10 - okay and this is something which
39:11 - is it's not you shouldn't be shy of this
39:13 - happens to everyone
39:14 - and what i will recommend guys is that
39:17 - you join
39:18 - a community okay so uh oh wow and
39:21 - actually so we had prince glaives had a
39:23 - home i learned a lot from that
39:24 - explanation
39:25 - a beginner understood it amazing glad i
39:27 - could provide some value to you
39:28 - um and if you did like it then smash
39:30 - thumbs up button and i will
39:32 - be happy to drop more of those
39:33 - explanations but guys like i said
39:36 - so you have those as your essential
39:38 - foundations right
39:39 - but what i would recommend is that
39:41 - journey gets very very quickly
39:43 - intimidating
39:44 - it gets scary it gets very sort of
39:46 - disheartening when things don't go our
39:47 - way
39:48 - so what i would recommend is you join
39:50 - some kind of community
39:51 - and guys you're in luck we actually have
39:54 - an amazing community
39:55 - where i am part of the team over at
39:57 - clever um i am part of that team and i
39:59 - teach over at that team so we have
40:01 - me we have kazi we have nars we have
40:02 - jacob and guys that is over at clever
40:05 - programmer and we have an amazing course
40:08 - called profit with
40:09 - javascript guys and what we do here is
40:12 - we is completely beginner friendly
40:14 - so guys when i say it's beginner
40:15 - friendly i mean it is completely you
40:18 - don't you need
40:19 - zero coding experience so zero coding
40:22 - experience is needed
40:23 - if you're going to join this course so
40:26 - xero coding experience is needed you can
40:29 - literally join this course and just get
40:30 - started
40:31 - so we are beginner friendly completely
40:33 - beginner friendly guys there are 15
40:35 - javascript modules that you can get
40:37 - started on straight away
40:38 - and guys this is where we get different
40:41 - okay so yes you probably have seen this
40:42 - you've probably seen like uh udemy
40:44 - courses that have like
40:45 - you know 15 courses or a bunch of
40:47 - courses but
40:49 - what makes us different guys what makes
40:51 - us different from everyone else and what
40:53 - why should you even consider joining a
40:56 - community like profit with javascript
40:58 - so the reason why i really think it will
41:01 - change your life by joining a community
41:03 - profit with javascript is because guys
41:05 - we have
41:06 - success coaches we have people who will
41:08 - give you
41:09 - their time and their dedication and they
41:11 - will give you personalized video
41:12 - feedback
41:13 - on not just one assignment guys on every
41:16 - single
41:16 - assignment like i'm not sure every
41:18 - single assignment that you
41:20 - submit in um profit with javascript you
41:23 - can get personalized video feedback
41:25 - and we have weekly live coaching calls
41:27 - guys so this is where literally
41:29 - you can work alongside me so i hold
41:31 - every tuesday i have a live coaching
41:33 - goal
41:34 - which is all about react and it's all
41:35 - about how you can
41:37 - maximize your efforts and how you can
41:39 - build an income
41:40 - and that leads me to our next point guys
41:42 - here we have
41:44 - how we basically don't just teach you
41:46 - how to
41:47 - actually learn all of the basics of web
41:50 - development
41:51 - but we also go into depth as to how you
41:53 - can actually go ahead
41:54 - and earn some and a killing with
41:56 - javascript so you can actually make a
41:58 - ton of money with javascript and we're
42:00 - going to teach you exactly how to do
42:02 - that
42:02 - so you have the modules where you can go
42:04 - at your own pace and you have the weekly
42:06 - coaching calls and we have up to four
42:07 - weekly coaching calls right now guys as
42:08 - well as these lives

43:03 - and you can go ahead and check out the
43:04 - course for yourself
43:06 - okay um so there we go okay so
43:10 - guys let's jump into why you should need
43:13 - to know these three
43:14 - trending or react js projects okay so
43:16 - the
43:17 - first project that we spoke about so i'm
43:18 - going to draw a list of things i think
43:20 - that's the way we're going to do this
43:21 - right
43:22 - i'm going to draw a list of different
43:24 - topics that i think as a react developer
43:26 - you need to have and if you have all of
43:29 - this
43:30 - so guys i'm gonna draw a list for you
43:32 - guys and i want you guys to take a
43:33 - screenshot of this list if
43:35 - once we've done it okay because this
43:37 - list is going to be the the thing that
43:38 - you're going to need
43:39 - to slowly check off and if you guys can
43:42 - do this and then you can build these
43:43 - apps
43:44 - these apps that i've showed you so the
43:45 - netflix app the amazon app the facebook
43:47 - messenger app
43:48 - they are going to basically demonstrate
43:51 - that you have these skills
43:52 - and this is what people look for guys
43:53 - this is what everyone will look for
43:55 - and this is what pretty much is going to
43:57 - allow you to land at that position as a
43:59 - javascript developer
44:00 - so let's go ahead and let's go ahead and
44:03 - list out those skills so
44:05 - first up we have um we have let's go
44:08 - ahead and check so yeah we have
44:10 - react.js okay so we all know about react
44:12 - so we've got
44:13 - react js so obviously it's a given it's
44:16 - the first one there we need to know it
44:18 - guys we need to know how to code and
44:20 - react okay
44:21 - the second one that we have is going to
44:23 - be um
44:25 - something that i would recommend you all
44:26 - learn is something within regarding css
44:29 - and that is
44:30 - flexbox guys flexbox is going to be
44:33 - massive and the reason why flexbox is so
44:36 - useful
44:37 - is because guys it's just going to allow
44:39 - you to build
44:40 - responsive websites okay so like we're
44:43 - talking websites
44:44 - that look like this so notice how when i
44:47 - resize this website
44:48 - do you see that guys it completely works
44:50 - in the way that i need it to work
44:52 - it's completely doing what it needs to
44:54 - do like nothing's breaking at this point
44:56 - right
44:56 - so if i go ahead and inspect this as a
44:58 - phone you guys can pretty much see like
45:00 - when it's in the tablet view look at
45:01 - that like look at the experience that
45:03 - you're getting there guys
45:04 - it doesn't break it doesn't freak out if
45:06 - anything look we've got this scrollable
45:08 - carousel at the bottom here
45:09 - and we've got this beautiful looking
45:10 - notice guys look at that as i scroll
45:12 - down
45:13 - how lovely is that transition at the top
45:15 - look at that like that smooth silky
45:17 - transition
45:18 - and like we can scroll through this
45:20 - everything's so nice and clean
45:21 - if i go ahead and click this link you
45:23 - see we get a drop down video
45:25 - and it just plays the video and we've
45:26 - got a live thing playing that
45:28 - so guys this is what we call responsive
45:31 - design okay
45:32 - and a lot of websites you will see this
45:34 - um in for example even here
45:36 - you can see as everything gets smaller
45:38 - it doesn't break guys it just simply
45:39 - restarts okay
45:40 - it restyles and it works accordingly and
45:43 - even here guys
45:44 - if we go ahead and inspect same deal
45:46 - right so that the app doesn't freak out
45:48 - it doesn't break
45:49 - but it just works really nicely so
45:50 - flexbox is going to allow you
45:52 - to be able to do these things okay so
45:54 - this is something that you really should
45:56 - get invest some time into
45:57 - so css in particular flexbox
46:00 - the next one is going to be something
46:04 - called
46:04 - the react so there's two things here
46:07 - guys there's the react
46:09 - context api okay now many of you guys
46:12 - who haven't actually used react
46:14 - so firstly i just want to kind of run
46:15 - through these points react is what is
46:17 - powering all of the
46:18 - these apps guys so all of the apps i've
46:20 - demonstrated so these three apps react
46:22 - is powering everything here so it's
46:24 - obviously going to be the number one
46:25 - skill that we have css flexbox allows us
46:28 - to have responsive designs
46:29 - and the third one is the react context
46:32 - api
46:32 - now for many of you who don't know what
46:35 - that is you may have also heard of
46:36 - something called redux
46:37 - okay now redux is simply going to redux
46:40 - is oh
46:41 - let's go ahead and do this now redux is
46:44 - so this right here is going to probably
46:46 - be
46:46 - one of the most valuable things you
46:48 - could learn
46:49 - to actually guarantee landing a job as a
46:52 - developer now
46:54 - what is the react context api
46:57 - okay so what is it and or what is redux
47:00 - so firstly i would recommend out of
47:02 - these two if you have heard of
47:03 - redux i would recommend that you
47:05 - actually go ahead and learn
47:06 - first learn the react context api and
47:09 - then you go ahead and learn redux
47:11 - because guys
47:12 - redux has a much sort of higher learning
47:15 - learning curve so react context api is
47:18 - actually going to be something which you
47:19 - can pick up relatively
47:21 - easily okay so it's relatively easy to
47:23 - pick it up once you actually understand
47:25 - what's going on and how it works
47:26 - and we actually have a tutorial of this
47:29 - in the
47:30 - amazon live build so you can go ahead
47:31 - and check that out and we pretty much
47:33 - show how all of that works
47:35 - now in redux is a it's a bit of a
47:37 - steeper learning curve okay
47:39 - so redux is something which is much
47:41 - harder so at this point my little hack
47:43 - for you guys
47:44 - is that if you can demonstrate that you
47:46 - know how to use the react context api
47:49 - then guys you can pretty much trick your
47:51 - way into a job because like
47:53 - at this point the react context api is
47:54 - so much easier to implement
47:56 - than redux and and you can pretty much
47:59 - demonstrate that because
48:00 - guys both of these things react context
48:02 - api and redux
48:04 - use the same patterns okay so if
48:06 - anyone's used that please let me know in
48:07 - the comment section i would love to see
48:09 - that
48:09 - um somebody just dropped a a very useful
48:12 - thing here they said learn grid
48:14 - and flexbox flexbox is great for
48:16 - one-dimensional changes
48:17 - uh grid is better for better page layout
48:19 - amazing
48:20 - uh comment right there guys very very
48:23 - good point so let's go ahead and add
48:24 - that to
48:25 - the the sort of uh the list of things so
48:27 - flexbox and
48:28 - css grid okay they are two very very
48:32 - important things guys
48:33 - so really good comment actually steve
48:35 - mccarty thank you for sharing that
48:36 - um bootstrap as well guys bootstrap's
48:39 - really good now
48:41 - when it comes to landing a job honestly
48:44 - i would really recommend
48:45 - you learn these two things so you
48:47 - actually focus and put more time into
48:49 - flexbox and grid
48:50 - css grid because guys these two are
48:53 - going to be what actually allow you
48:55 - to go ahead and build custom websites
48:58 - now when you know flexbox
49:00 - uh well when you know i'm sorry
49:01 - bootstrap most of the time i find that i
49:04 - fight with boot traps so i've kind of
49:05 - stopped
49:06 - using it as much right um so steve
49:09 - mccarthy oh actually dropped another
49:10 - thing so he said so steve mccarthy is
49:12 - actually a
49:13 - cto i believe i saw a comment earlier so
49:15 - guys this is a really this is a comment
49:17 - from somebody who's actually in the
49:18 - industry and stuff he goes
49:19 - you can just use context we never use
49:21 - redux and that's a very fair point guys
49:23 - i've actually stopped using redux in a
49:25 - lot of my
49:26 - uh my my own projects because it's just
49:28 - so heavy like there's no need to have
49:30 - such a heavy
49:31 - sort of add-on into react um and so i
49:33 - actually try and use
49:35 - uh i keep it very lightweight with the
49:36 - react context api
49:38 - um so let's go ahead and have a look um
49:41 - somebody actually asked okay so i will
49:43 - go into that question afterwards but
49:45 - somebody asked what the difference is
49:46 - between react and react native
49:47 - and if anyone else wants to know that
49:49 - drop a comment because that's actually a
49:50 - very good question and we will come to
49:52 - that in a second
49:53 - okay um so uh yeah so what i'm gonna do
49:57 - now is go ahead and carry on guys so
50:00 - there's a few more things okay so
50:03 - authentication
50:04 - so authentication is something that's
50:06 - pretty huge guys
50:07 - it's pretty huge for one simple reason
50:09 - we need it everywhere okay
50:10 - so authentication now when i'm talking
50:13 - about authentication i'm talking about
50:15 - yes like you saw earlier guys logging
50:18 - into systems okay so like here i had
50:20 - sunny
50:21 - dummy gmail.com
50:24 - gmail.com oh god what's going on
50:27 - gmail.com
50:28 - and here i do abc and we sign in and
50:31 - look you can see it signed me in so that
50:33 - is an actual completely built
50:35 - authentication system guys
50:37 - and the way i did that is i learned how
50:39 - to use something called firebase
50:40 - authentication
50:41 - so over here we have firebase
50:44 - authentication and what they allow you
50:45 - to do in firebase and we teach this in
50:47 - the live
50:47 - live streams and in the uh profit with
50:50 - javascript course which
50:51 - uh remember guys link in the bio if you
50:53 - are interested in joining us
50:54 - i teach this every single week in the
50:56 - react coaching course
50:57 - but what you can do with uh firebase
51:00 - authentication
51:01 - is you can actually go ahead and click
51:03 - sign in method and guys what's amazing
51:05 - is for those of you who haven't actually
51:07 - gone ahead and implemented a
51:09 - authentication system before
51:11 - it's a nightmare it's actually quite a
51:13 - big headache to get that done
51:15 - but firebase make it so effortless guys
51:18 - like not only do you get email and
51:21 - password registration get phone login
51:23 - you get google login you get facebook
51:24 - twitter
51:25 - github microsoft apple and even
51:26 - anonymous authentication
51:28 - which is amazing and also you can
51:30 - authorize just the domains that you want
51:32 - so that you can sort of protect your app
51:34 - if anyone's worried about security
51:35 - and guys they even go a step further so
51:37 - you know those things like when you
51:38 - forget your password and those sort of
51:40 - things right you can even have it's all
51:43 - built in
51:44 - so you can actually just modify the
51:45 - template here and you would literally
51:46 - just click on this link
51:48 - and this link would just take you so i'm
51:49 - going to go ahead and open that look oh
51:51 - okay that one's not deployed so it's not
51:52 - going to work but it's going to actually
51:53 - allow you to go ahead
51:54 - and just follow that link and reset your
51:56 - password
51:57 - if you were to implement that
51:59 - functionality in the website so
52:01 - all of this stuff guys is actually
52:03 - really really like it is it's
52:04 - game-changing like i'm not joking when i
52:06 - say this it's game changing and whenever
52:08 - we sort of live demo this and we show
52:10 - people this the the sort of learning
52:12 - curve to this stuff is actually not that
52:14 - high but the
52:15 - the output and what you end up building
52:17 - like honestly like the fact that you can
52:19 - build
52:19 - this and you can have a database and you
52:22 - can have the react context api
52:24 - so again remember we spoke about the
52:26 - react context api
52:27 - this app right here is using it guys so
52:29 - i'll go into that in a second
52:32 - but just want to wrap up on that final
52:33 - comment as to around the authentication
52:35 - so like even if right now if i was to
52:37 - let's just go ahead and uh zoom in so
52:39 - you can see over here
52:40 - we've got sunny so as soon as i sign up
52:42 - guys if i click this this will actually
52:45 - de-authenticate me and sign me out and
52:48 - you see that there was no refresh it was
52:49 - everything was very quick and sweet
52:51 - now you can already start to see what
52:53 - i'm trying to go with here right so we
52:55 - have some authentication
52:56 - but like guys i remember i said earlier
52:58 - don't list out your
53:00 - traits right and the reason why i say
53:01 - don't list out your traits is because
53:04 - it's literally a case of if you can go
53:06 - ahead and show apps like this if you can
53:08 - go ahead and just look
53:09 - if i can if you could just give someone
53:10 - a link and say go ahead and by the way
53:12 - guys
53:12 - if you actually want to check this out
53:13 - for yourself the links for these apps
53:15 - are in the description so if you don't
53:17 - believe me and you think these are fake
53:18 - then just go ahead and check them out
53:20 - okay so um
53:22 - yeah what i want you guys to go and do
53:23 - is go check it out and yeah like if you
53:25 - had an employer and you said like he's
53:26 - like oh have you ever used an
53:27 - authentication system you could be like
53:28 - sure let me actually
53:29 - pull up my app right now and show you so
53:32 - you can go here sign in
53:33 - boom you can show them that you have
53:35 - complete authentication and guys
53:36 - even check this out right so look what
53:38 - i'm about to do right now so say that i
53:40 - have an email address right here
53:41 - so gmail.com and say like my password is
53:43 - too short and i try and click create an
53:45 - account
53:46 - password should be at least six
53:47 - characters that's all powered by
53:48 - firebase guys which is insane
53:50 - right and we actually go through this on
53:52 - the live demonstration previously so you
53:54 - guys can go ahead and check that out if
53:56 - you find that useful
53:57 - so the authentication is a big big big
54:00 - important topic that you guys will need
54:03 - to learn okay
54:04 - now the next one that i want to brush
54:06 - over is uh hosting
54:08 - okay so hosting so hosting so a lot of
54:12 - people
54:12 - i tend to see have uh applications they
54:15 - sort of have things built
54:17 - um but they tend to basically so when i
54:19 - say okay like perfect can you show me
54:21 - then what i tend to see is they would
54:24 - actually go ahead
54:25 - and be like yeah here's my github link
54:28 - just clone it just do npm start and just
54:30 - run it
54:31 - and you're like oh man like and then
54:33 - what would happen is you usually run
54:34 - into some kind of environment variable
54:36 - setup
54:37 - and guys like you just need to be able
54:39 - to show
54:40 - the app as easy as possible like right
54:42 - now if any of you guys go ahead and like
54:44 - click that link you can go and check
54:46 - this out yourself like and this is what
54:48 - i'm saying like
54:49 - not only are they going to be able to
54:51 - see what you have built right they're
54:53 - going to be able to go ahead and see
54:54 - what you've built
54:54 - but as soon as they look at this app
54:56 - they can see like straight away
54:57 - like remember those topics that we spoke
54:59 - about earlier oops we spoke about
55:00 - earlier so
55:02 - we had css flexbox and grid right
55:04 - straight away they can see here you've
55:06 - got some flexbox going on
55:07 - okay wow like this guy knows how to use
55:09 - flexbox then you can be like the react
55:11 - context api you can look sure
55:12 - this uses the right context api for
55:14 - those of you who don't know what that is
55:16 - uh essentially it's basically like a
55:18 - data layer okay so like for
55:20 - example i have the basket over at this
55:22 - side and the basket is a completely
55:24 - separate component to the uh home page
55:27 - so right here so if i go ahead and add a
55:29 - few things to my basket
55:30 - and add a few things over here you see i
55:32 - have access to it over here so
55:33 - essentially we're pushing things into
55:34 - that data layer
55:35 - and then i can actually manipulate them
55:37 - by using uh dispatching things called
55:39 - actions
55:40 - and notice when i remove the final one
55:42 - look what happens whoa
55:43 - you have no items in your basket and
55:45 - actually you see that subtotal at the
55:46 - side so if i go ahead and add a few more
55:48 - items
55:48 - you can see this look at that subtotal
55:51 - and actually tally's the upside guys so
55:52 - notice the price right here
55:54 - if i deduct 239 i should have 11.96 here
55:57 - i know i wasn't working out i just
55:58 - looked at the price so if we go ahead
56:00 - and do that
56:02 - i can see look pay attention to this
56:03 - over here so
56:05 - boom and look at that you see it updated
56:07 - the price right over here and everything
56:09 - worked in real time so now
56:11 - just from that um demo you can pretty
56:13 - much demonstrate that you know
56:15 - how to use the react context api okay
56:18 - and not only that authentication we
56:20 - spoke about you can pretty much demo
56:21 - this and you can then again
56:23 - talk about how you have authentication
56:25 - and you can use it and guys all of this
56:26 - is hosted
56:27 - right so we teach you how to do that so
56:30 - if you literally are unsure about oh you
56:32 - want you're interested in knowing how we
56:33 - do that
56:34 - check out the live sessions or if you're
56:36 - really interested want to go in depth
56:38 - pwj guys profit with javascript link is
56:40 - in the description and you can go ahead
56:42 - and join us and i will literally
56:44 - personally jump on a call with you
56:46 - right after this and we can pretty much
56:47 - have a chat and we can talk about how to
56:49 - do that
56:49 - and that's not a joke guys i will
56:51 - literally physically jump on a call with
56:53 - you guys and go ahead and
56:55 - and and if i get enough people we can
56:58 - start building something right so that's
56:59 - what
57:00 - literally i'm promising to you guys so
57:02 - let's go ahead and carry on so
57:04 - we have firebase hosting um so yeah
57:08 - uh just to give you guys a demonstration
57:09 - if you go into firebase hosting you can
57:11 - actually see over here you have like a
57:13 - bunch of deployments where i pushed the
57:14 - app out
57:15 - and guys i said it's so powerful because
57:17 - like say for example i deployed the app
57:18 - and something went crazy wrong
57:20 - and i broke everything i could just go
57:22 - here click this button and click roll
57:23 - back
57:24 - oh some of you guys might be able to see
57:25 - that but if i click this row back that
57:27 - will literally
57:28 - just undo all the changes okay it will
57:30 - undo the changes
57:31 - and literally it will save the day so
57:34 - these are really valuable skills okay
57:36 - and you kind of start to see like
57:38 - um okay so steve mccarthy says change
57:40 - the basket in the amazon applicator for
57:42 - multiples of the same item yes
57:44 - very good point so i will just put that
57:46 - here it's a really good point steve
57:48 - we can actually include a part two so if
57:49 - you guys are interested in seeing a part
57:51 - two for this
57:52 - and where we actually sort of gather so
57:54 - that what steve's saying
57:55 - is if we had like several of these books
57:58 - inside of the basket so they grouped
57:59 - some together so it would actually say
58:01 - six or like five books as opposed to
58:04 - having like just like
58:05 - um them stack on top of each other if
58:07 - you want to know about that or even how
58:08 - we can have like a checkout and a
58:09 - payment system
58:10 - then let us know in the comments and
58:12 - actually just like guys remember
58:14 - i tell you what right now guys if you
58:16 - want to see a part two
58:18 - of either the netflix clone so even the
58:21 - netflix clone
58:22 - so you want us to go a bit more in depth
58:23 - into this stuff so if you're going to go
58:25 - a bit more in depth into this
58:26 - or if you want to go a bit more in depth
58:28 - into the amazon app then
58:30 - let me know by literally grabbing your
58:33 - phone
58:34 - shooting a story tag me in it so my tag
58:37 - is right here
58:38 - where is it okay it's so hard to do this
58:40 - okay so yeah up here
58:41 - tag me in it and let me know because and
58:44 - just literally write like we want part
58:46 - two
58:46 - that's all i want right we want part two
58:49 - and that's
58:49 - it guys all i need to hear is we need it
58:51 - we want part two
58:52 - and i'm gonna build that for you guys
58:54 - and i'm gonna go ahead and build it
58:56 - free on youtube live and literally we
58:58 - can go ahead and get that running and up
59:00 - and running okay
59:01 - so if you guys find that and you if that
59:03 - guy's if that excites you guys
59:04 - drop some fire in in the chat and hit
59:07 - the smash
59:08 - smash the thumbs up button and i will be
59:09 - happy to go ahead and build that kind of
59:11 - stuff for you
59:12 - so let's carry on guys the next one that
59:16 - many of us know
59:16 - and love is something like this it goes
59:19 - something like this is databases okay
59:21 - now the one database that we all may
59:22 - have heard of is sql
59:24 - you've got nosql databases and the
59:26 - example of nosql database is something
59:27 - like mongodb
59:29 - and this is where you'll start to hear
59:31 - words like man stack
59:33 - okay now these are great okay but
59:36 - i highly recommend you just go ahead and
59:38 - learn firebase
59:39 - and in particular what i'm talking about
59:41 - is firebase
59:42 - firestore now why am i telling you to
59:45 - learn this
59:46 - because it allows you to have such a
59:48 - powerful app
59:49 - with such little setup guys now i'm not
59:52 - joking it's such a powerful app
59:54 - with very little setup so this right
59:56 - here the learning curve to this
59:58 - is extremely easy once you get it it's
60:01 - extremely easy and it's
60:02 - so powerful guys like this is so
60:06 - powerful it's insane
60:08 - like let's go ahead and look at the app
60:09 - that we spoke about
60:11 - um earlier so let's go ahead and look at
60:14 - the app that we spoke about earlier
60:16 - um so we've got this so let's go ahead
60:19 - and check this out so
60:20 - over here if we go type message and
60:22 - press this so if i go ahead and do this
60:24 - so i say like
60:25 - um yo hello guys
60:28 - right now notice how guys this is all in
60:30 - a db right now so if i go ahead and do
60:32 - this
60:33 - yo hello guys look at that it was real
60:34 - time right so that was a real time
60:36 - uh like real time we pushed it into
60:38 - database and it updated
60:39 - right so i can see loads of comments
60:41 - flooding in right now part two netflix
60:43 - oh yeah let's do this
60:45 - um let's have products from the database
60:47 - yes we can definitely do that awesome we
60:49 - can definitely do that guys
60:51 - um so what i would like to yeah so we
60:54 - pretty much have
60:56 - in this case um we didn't use a db for
60:59 - the netflix build
61:00 - for here we could definitely upgrade
61:01 - this to have products in the ndb
61:03 - here guys we actually used apis so that
61:05 - leads me onto my next point so
61:07 - um i will come back to the database
61:09 - point but like here right now
61:11 - is using how to use an api how to use an
61:14 - api now for those of you who don't know
61:15 - what an api is
61:16 - an api is pretty much it's called an
61:18 - application programming interface now
61:20 - do we care what what that means honestly
61:24 - like like no we don't really need to
61:26 - know exactly what that means but all we
61:27 - need to know
61:28 - is that when you have one service guys
61:30 - it's like let's say for example i had um
61:32 - so the way i pulled those films in
61:34 - so the way i pulled all of these films
61:36 - in was is was on a service called
61:39 - tmdb okay so we had tmdb
61:42 - so tmdb and this was a movie database
61:44 - okay now they had something called an
61:46 - api
61:47 - which allowed act with all of the data
61:49 - that they have and basically what i was
61:51 - able to do is pull
61:52 - that in and you see like i didn't
61:53 - manually enter any of this stuff like i
61:55 - just pulled this in from an api
61:57 - and i rendered it on my front end and
61:59 - pretty much look at notice the top right
62:00 - here
62:01 - if i refresh this guys look at this like
62:04 - um so
62:05 - that in that time it stayed the same but
62:06 - if i refresh it again look we've got a
62:07 - new top it's dynamic okay it's pulling
62:09 - from that api
62:11 - and here we have star wars and the clone
62:12 - wars and like you can see like guys
62:14 - it's pulling it dynamically and you can
62:16 - pretty much see
62:17 - um you can pretty much see the
62:20 - information being refreshed in real time
62:22 - and it's going to be pulling from that
62:23 - api
62:24 - bringing it in and it shows that you can
62:26 - use an api
62:27 - so guys that's what i'm saying here can
62:28 - you start to see where this is pulling
62:30 - together right
62:31 - so like here we have this is a going to
62:34 - be a completely
62:35 - like a massively valuable skill to learn
62:38 - right here
62:38 - and how to use an api because payment
62:40 - systems like stripe
62:42 - like like uh paypal all of these systems
62:45 - guys they require you
62:46 - to actually interact with their api so
62:49 - knowing how to use an api
62:50 - is going to be massively valuable um
62:54 - so somebody says can we build a large
62:55 - application with firebase yes we can
62:57 - definitely we can and actually we've
62:59 - already built a fair amount of
63:00 - applications with it
63:02 - so the netflix app was built with
63:04 - firebase the
63:05 - um amazon app was built with firebase so
63:07 - we had well these are all being hosted
63:09 - on firebase right now
63:10 - this app was actually had a firebase
63:11 - database inside of it
63:13 - so of course to answer your question yes
63:16 - we can
63:17 - um and if you guys have any ideas again
63:19 - shoot a story
63:20 - tag me in it over here and if you guys
63:22 - aren't following give me a follow
63:23 - because
63:24 - i do like to post a bit of content about
63:26 - all of this stuff and
63:27 - also if you want to keep in touch or you
63:29 - want some support or help
63:30 - then yep i would be happy to have chat
63:32 - with you guys
63:33 - um let's go ahead and check so now we
63:35 - had we talked about apis
63:38 - um i think let's go ahead and have a
63:40 - second
63:41 - look at the um so let's go ahead and
63:44 - double check over at this
63:46 - because this is actually a really
63:47 - interesting important point guys
63:49 - databases okay now databases why are
63:52 - they so important like why
63:54 - why do we need a database because in
63:56 - react
63:57 - what tends to happen guys is no it's
63:58 - what happens there okay
64:00 - so when you're on the amazon website
64:01 - typically when you add things to your
64:03 - database let's say i go ahead and add
64:04 - some items here and i go ahead and i add
64:06 - i need a new
64:07 - mixer i need actually i want an amazon
64:09 - echo i'm going to go ahead and grab a
64:11 - ipad
64:12 - pro okay so i go ahead and grab that
64:14 - click the checkout button
64:16 - so i've got i'm gonna delete that so i
64:18 - just got a few things here right
64:20 - now what happens is that even though
64:22 - this is using the react context api
64:24 - right now it's a case of
64:28 - right now it's a case of if i refresh
64:30 - the page
64:31 - react has non-persistent right
64:34 - the react has non-persistent um it has
64:37 - non-persistent memory which means look
64:39 - what happens when i refresh
64:40 - guys look what happens
64:43 - it disappears okay disappears so we do
64:46 - we really really do need oh that's a
64:49 - really nice question somebody just asked
64:50 - so i'm gonna actually pin that right now
64:52 - and i will get to that in a sec um so
64:54 - guys we do need databases because
64:56 - um you see like this information like
64:59 - one i'd like to have this information in
65:01 - the database like right now
65:02 - all of this stuff is essentially stored
65:03 - in a database but we're pulling it from
65:05 - an api okay
65:06 - but for example these messages when
65:08 - you're in a messenger app like for
65:09 - example whatsapp
65:10 - you don't go into your phone and your
65:12 - messages are suddenly disappeared right
65:14 - you need to keep those messages you need
65:16 - to have them so
65:17 - knowing how to use databases is
65:19 - massively valuable
65:21 - and i would recommend that each of you
65:22 - guys go ahead and just sign up to
65:24 - firebase it's completely free
65:25 - click the database tab and start messing
65:28 - around with
65:29 - firestore so here you would just go here
65:31 - create database
65:33 - start in test mode and that will
65:34 - actually allow you to to sort of go into
65:36 - it and you don't need to do the
65:37 - production mode just yet guys
65:39 - click next and you can pretty much go
65:41 - through this and set up your first sort
65:43 - of database instance and guys here you
65:44 - can see it's a real-time database
65:46 - powerful queries and automatic scaling
65:47 - which means that no matter what if
65:49 - 10 billion people went on to this app
65:52 - it's going
65:52 - to work and it's going to scale because
65:55 - guys you have the power of google
65:56 - with this stuff now a lot of people
65:59 - might be wondering yeah but man stack
66:00 - merch what about mongodb what about
66:02 - express and things like that
66:04 - and this leads me on to uh this question
66:07 - oops i actually had two
66:08 - things pinned up so this leads me on to
66:10 - this question right here
66:12 - so guys what's your take on cloud
66:16 - functions by firebase so zacky
66:18 - very very good question okay it's a
66:20 - really really good question and actually
66:22 - this is something that i'm going to go
66:23 - ahead
66:24 - and add because it's so amazing that
66:25 - you've said that so let me go ahead and
66:27 - i'm going to go ahead and
66:29 - just pop this up for a second i'm going
66:31 - to go here and i'm going to go add that
66:32 - so
66:33 - serverless architectures guys serverless
66:37 - architectures or let's just call it
66:38 - let's just go ahead and call it
66:39 - serverless
66:40 - and what i mean by that is i'm going to
66:41 - add it underneath i'm going to say learn
66:44 - how to use cloud functions
66:48 - right now a lot of you guys would have
66:50 - seen something called
66:52 - express right we all might have run into
66:54 - it at one point
66:55 - express is going to be so like
66:59 - um so you so let me get rid of that so
67:01 - some of us would have heard about
67:02 - something called express
67:04 - or uh and that runs using node.js okay
67:07 - so express uses
67:09 - something called node.js right node.js
67:12 - and node.js is essentially just
67:14 - javascript but it's just for the backend
67:15 - so it's on the servers right
67:16 - so react and normal javascript runs on
67:18 - the front end and we have node.js on the
67:19 - backend
67:20 - express is where you have your own
67:21 - server right so imagine like we have our
67:24 - own server so let's go ahead and say
67:25 - like we have our own server
67:27 - and that's somewhere here and then we
67:28 - have our web page so like up here so
67:31 - this is our cool little web page right
67:32 - so this is our portfolio at the top
67:34 - and then this every night so say i click
67:36 - on a button on this web page
67:38 - it makes a request to my server
67:41 - and then my server might make a request
67:43 - it might send some information back okay
67:46 - now typically what we used to have to do
67:48 - is we'd have to maintain our own servers
67:50 - okay so we'd have to maintain our own
67:51 - servers but
67:53 - now with serverless architectures what
67:55 - we can do is we can actually build
67:56 - these amazingly powerful cloud
68:00 - functions guys and this is where
68:02 - serverless architectures come in
68:03 - and guys once you know how to use a
68:06 - cloud function so yes the learning curve
68:08 - is fairly
68:08 - so i'd say it's a medium level skill
68:11 - okay so it's a medium
68:13 - level skill like it's going to take you
68:15 - a little bit of time to get used to it
68:16 - but once you know it
68:17 - and once you understand what's going on
68:19 - with service architectures they're just
68:20 - more scary they just sound more scary
68:22 - than they really are guys
68:23 - and again if you guys do want to know
68:25 - that we i go into
68:27 - heavy depth and i will actually go into
68:29 - these uh and the coaching course on uh
68:31 - profit with javascript
68:32 - uh every single week so these uh weekly
68:35 - coaching
68:36 - calls right here i actually go into this
68:38 - uh quite heavily especially because a
68:40 - lot of my students have been
68:41 - asking for this um so i will be doing
68:43 - this uh especially i think it's next
68:45 - tuesday i'll actually i can cover this
68:46 - next tuesday so
68:47 - if you guys are interested be sure to go
68:49 - ahead and join profit with javascript
68:51 - link in the description
68:53 - make sure you go and check that out okay
68:56 - so um let's go back to that drawing that
68:59 - i was
68:59 - mentioning so yeah here we have react.js
69:02 - um yeah so service architectures
69:03 - so really good point by zacky talib and
69:06 - i think that might have been over
69:08 - the top of that so i if you guys can see
69:10 - that um here we have
69:12 - what i was talking about serverless and
69:13 - learning how to use cloud functions
69:15 - now what are cloud functions really good
69:17 - point and again
69:18 - guys you wouldn't be surprised that
69:20 - firebase also supports that
69:22 - right so firebase is something you need
69:24 - in your arsenal of skills and things
69:26 - like that right
69:27 - um somebody said how many people i know
69:31 - um okay so here like function oh that's
69:34 - a really good point so somebody said how
69:35 - many people were in yet
69:36 - and then he replied saying 10 billion
69:38 - right 10 billion people in the mouth
69:40 - like guys with with functions with cloud
69:43 - functions
69:44 - even if 10 billion people go into your
69:46 - app you have got google servers that
69:48 - will scale
69:49 - and handle that capacity right so
69:52 - literally you're going to it's going to
69:54 - work regardless of how big and how big
69:57 - is and things like that
69:58 - so honestly it will live is not clear
70:01 - maybe some connection issues guys if it
70:02 - is cutting out that's completely fine it
70:04 - will be up afterwards to
70:06 - re-watch um right so here guys
70:09 - here is pretty my cloud function is
70:11 - essentially a piece of code so it's a
70:13 - function which is going to be hosted
70:14 - online and it is going to allow you so a
70:17 - lot of people are asking what would you
70:19 - use your own
70:20 - backend instead of firebase so guys i
70:22 - would actually recommend you go ahead
70:23 - and just if you do
70:24 - so this is my advice to you guys right
70:27 - build
70:27 - your front end until you need a back end
70:31 - right so build your front end until you
70:34 - find a requirement for your backend and
70:36 - then
70:37 - go ahead and if it's a database that you
70:39 - need go ahead and use
70:40 - a firebase to handle your database right
70:44 - now if that doesn't solve all the real
70:45 - problems and you need some more
70:47 - functionality past that then i would
70:50 - recommend that you go ahead and
70:52 - look at something called um
70:55 - cloud functions so over here cloud
70:58 - functions right
70:59 - now this is basically where you would
71:01 - essentially write a function
71:03 - and buffering quite a lot it says okay
71:05 - so i'm sorry about that guys it should
71:06 - be clearing up
71:07 - soon um and basically what's going to
71:09 - happen here is
71:10 - is basically you're going to write a
71:12 - function you're going to deploy it
71:14 - online
71:15 - and then basically you'll get an end
71:16 - point so an api endpoint and pretty much
71:18 - you can call that endpoint and we use
71:20 - cloud functions all the time at clever
71:22 - programmer
71:23 - to get everything that we need working
71:25 - and it works and scales amazingly
71:27 - um so definitely definitely definitely
71:30 - something i would recommend
71:31 - you guys or learn um so really really
71:34 - useful stuff right there
71:35 - so guys recap of everything that we have
71:37 - right here so we have a react
71:39 - js which is going to be your absolute
71:43 - game changer in terms of making money
71:46 - so react.js is going to be your money
71:49 - pot guys
71:49 - it's going to be pretty much if you
71:51 - learn this one skill it's going to be
71:53 - huge for you guys um then you have css
71:56 - and in particular
71:57 - you have css flexbox and you have css
72:00 - grid
72:01 - and then guys we're talking about the
72:02 - react context api
72:04 - right so the react context apis let me
72:06 - just clean this up a bit
72:08 - so we have the react context api over
72:10 - here so
72:11 - let me just clean that boom boom boom
72:13 - boom boom there we go nice little tool
72:15 - right here
72:16 - so we have the react context api so
72:18 - definitely go ahead and learn this it's
72:20 - going to be massive value again
72:22 - like i said guys go ahead and learn the
72:24 - context api instead of
72:25 - redux redux has a much harder sort of
72:28 - learning curve if you guys
72:29 - like and enjoy the react context api
72:32 - then go ahead and give redux a try so
72:34 - start with this and then move over to
72:36 - that
72:36 - okay then i want you guys to go ahead
72:39 - and
72:40 - fit all of these into your skill set
72:42 - okay so i'm talking authentication
72:44 - hosting databases
72:45 - how to use an api serverless and how to
72:47 - use cloud functions now
72:49 - that sounds like a hell of a lot of
72:50 - things to do guys it sounds like a lot
72:52 - of things
72:52 - but do you know what demonstrates all of
72:55 - this in one page so like this is kind of
72:57 - cool right but this is a list
72:58 - right now if i showed you this you'd be
73:00 - like oh my god sonny there's so much on
73:02 - the webpage there's just too much to
73:03 - handle
73:04 - right you're just going to be like there
73:05 - is just so much here like this is what
73:07 - people see when they see lists it's just
73:09 - nothing's clear right but let's go ahead
73:12 - and break this down
73:13 - into those three projects that we showed
73:15 - earlier right
73:16 - so let's go ahead and break that down so
73:18 - we had react
73:19 - right react is being used in each of
73:22 - these web pages right now
73:24 - it's being used here it's being used
73:26 - here and it's being used here
73:28 - right look somebody's actually on hey
73:30 - nice good to see you there
73:32 - um so we pretty much have all each of
73:35 - these strings
73:36 - uh each of these three amazing apps
73:38 - being powered by react
73:39 - so that already sort of starts to put
73:42 - you into you know
73:43 - into that space of like earning as a
73:45 - react developer maybe you're not at the
73:46 - 118 mark yeah but like you're definitely
73:48 - in the space of a junior position at
73:50 - that point
73:51 - right then we want to talk about the
73:54 - react context api so we're talking about
73:56 - this
73:57 - right now the react context api is
73:59 - basically where look look at this this
74:01 - this uh demo pretty much demonstrates
74:03 - that you can use that you can go ahead
74:04 - and add a few things to your basket
74:06 - it works so there you go it saw some
74:08 - information like there you go it works
74:10 - really well
74:11 - everything gets updated appropriately
74:13 - you can demo it you can show your skill
74:14 - set off
74:15 - now awesome like you pretty much can
74:18 - demonstrate that you know how to use the
74:20 - react context api
74:21 - and once you know how to use that i've
74:22 - seen the developer will know that
74:24 - because you know how to use that
74:26 - it's very likely that you can pick up
74:27 - redux pretty easy because the two
74:29 - patterns are very similar
74:30 - okay then we spoke about authentication
74:33 - so authentication guys you can just demo
74:35 - this you can demo how you can sign
74:37 - in you can demo how it all works and how
74:39 - it uses firebase authentication to
74:40 - handle that right
74:42 - we have hosting that's very simple when
74:45 - you have three apps on your portfolio
74:46 - you can say hey
74:47 - all three of these apps are hosted so
74:49 - there you go all three apps are hosted
74:51 - they're gonna be live and you can pretty
74:53 - much show that you know how to host an
74:55 - app
74:56 - then we have how to use an api guys
74:59 - here we're pretty much like once you
75:00 - have this app built look at this you
75:02 - have the whole app built and it's
75:03 - pulling in
75:04 - from the tm db movie database right here
75:08 - so it's pulling all of these films in
75:09 - from here
75:11 - and it's using an api to do that right
75:13 - so you can pretty much show like yeah i
75:14 - know how to use an api
75:15 - and i know also by the way while you're
75:17 - showing that you'll be like oh yeah also
75:19 - i know about responsive design look
75:20 - check it out
75:22 - see how the top banner changed look at
75:23 - that works really nice
75:26 - and you can pretty much demonstrate that
75:27 - and you can show like how everything
75:29 - works really slick and really nice okay
75:31 - so we have that and then we have
75:34 - serverless and how to use cloud
75:35 - functions
75:36 - so in this case these three applications
75:38 - are don't actually demonstrate we did
75:40 - actually have a cool cloud function here
75:42 - where
75:42 - if there was any sort of bad language
75:44 - that was used here then it was going to
75:45 - actually it uses a cloud function to
75:47 - exit out
75:48 - but we protected that because we don't
75:49 - want anyone swearing on these live chats
75:51 - we want to keep it positive up in here
75:53 - guys um so yeah we want to keep that
75:55 - very fresh and clean but
75:56 - you can definitely quite easily go ahead
75:59 - and get that built as well
76:01 - uh into these apps so take away from
76:04 - this guys
76:05 - all of these skills that we spoke about
76:07 - here right
76:08 - all of these skills so like all of the
76:10 - ones mentioned here
76:12 - if you have all of those skills right
76:15 - then you can either one list it in a
76:18 - boring
76:19 - resume you can list it in a boring
76:21 - resume you can either like
76:23 - list all these skills out and yeah you
76:25 - can add some color to it you can make it
76:26 - look a bit colorful like this
76:28 - or you can just have it looking very
76:29 - dull and sort of you know
76:31 - like that right or
76:34 - you can go ahead and be like you know
76:37 - what boom
76:38 - here's my portfolio look how beautiful
76:40 - it is
76:41 - look for yourself give it a play around
76:43 - the person the the developer is going to
76:44 - come in and be like whoa like
76:46 - this is real time like and then you
76:47 - could literally play with them
76:49 - you're going to show off how you know
76:50 - how to use react you know how to use
76:52 - reactors you built three amazing apps
76:54 - that look beautiful with it
76:56 - you're going to show how you can use the
76:57 - react context api and you can demo it
76:59 - and you can pretty much play through it
77:00 - and say yeah
77:01 - sure like have a go with it you know
77:03 - what let's go ahead and buy something
77:04 - together
77:05 - you can demo all of that with him you're
77:07 - going to go ahead and show how you know
77:08 - authentication because you've got that
77:10 - up and running on your app
77:11 - hosting sure all three apps are hosted
77:14 - they can scale um
77:16 - and guys oh very good point by the way
77:18 - uh so i'm going to pin this for a for in
77:21 - a second this is a very um
77:23 - good sort of point here so i will go
77:25 - ahead and hide that for now
77:26 - but guys um yeah so you pretty much have
77:29 - those
77:30 - being demonstrated you have apis you're
77:32 - demonstrating how you can use your api
77:35 - here
77:35 - and you have responsive design so guys
77:37 - pretty much just by
77:38 - showing these three apps do you see the
77:41 - wealth of knowledge that you are
77:43 - demonstrating
77:45 - it's it's like it's insane like as a
77:47 - junior developer
77:48 - if i saw somebody rock up to an
77:50 - interview and be like yeah i've got some
77:52 - three apps i'd like to show you
77:54 - and they presented these three apps and
77:56 - they were able to run through
77:57 - i'd be like wow not only are these apps
77:59 - beautiful
78:00 - these apps are super functional and this
78:03 - guy's gone ahead and he's learning
78:04 - cutting edge stuff or this girl's going
78:06 - ahead and learning cutting-edge stuff
78:08 - like it's really gonna separate you from
78:10 - the crowd right now let's go ahead and
78:12 - take a moment to go ahead and answer
78:13 - some questions
78:15 - so we have david dunnington says have
78:17 - you got a react nate of course so it's
78:19 - very good question guys
78:20 - if you guys don't know what react native
78:23 - is it is essentially
78:25 - so you have react and then you have
78:27 - react native react native is how you
78:29 - build ios and android apps
78:30 - so let's go ahead and i'm just going to
78:33 - go ahead and do this so
78:35 - how do i cut this out so let's just go
78:37 - ahead and grab all of this
78:38 - so you can pretty much use react so
78:40 - react is how you're going to build
78:42 - web apps so you have react oops react
78:45 - i'm not the best drawer guys i apologize
78:48 - so we have react and then we have a
78:49 - reactor native okay
78:51 - so react
78:54 - native
79:00 - okay we have react and we have react
79:02 - native okay now
79:04 - react is essentially how we're going to
79:06 - build all of these beautiful apps so you
79:08 - can see this
79:08 - now guys the entire code base so when
79:11 - you have a react now react is you see it
79:13 - as that sort of oh god that's horrible
79:15 - like all of the skills that you're going
79:16 - to learn here so every all of the skills
79:18 - that you learn with react whether it's
79:20 - the context api whether it's
79:22 - um responsive design even or like
79:24 - anything where
79:25 - whether it be how to use authentication
79:27 - how to use like use effect use hooks so
79:30 - like even the hooks for example so react
79:32 - hooks
79:33 - um everything is transferable so you can
79:36 - cross this bridge guys
79:38 - it's completely transferable with react
79:41 - native so you can use all of that
79:43 - and you can use that to make money guys
79:45 - like you can go ahead and you make money
79:46 - with this and now
79:47 - for those of you wondering what is this
79:50 - like what is react native
79:51 - it's basically how you go ahead and
79:53 - build ios
79:54 - and android apps using um
79:57 - a react code base so essentially what
79:59 - you would do is you would
80:00 - you can code up an app in react and say
80:02 - you want to make an ios and android app
80:03 - from it you can just pretty much
80:05 - translate the code base to react native
80:07 - and you can basically take a react app
80:09 - so a web page
80:10 - where you've got a bunch of stuff on
80:11 - side of that web page and you can pretty
80:13 - much translate that
80:14 - to a beautiful looking iphone app so you
80:17 - can pretty much have a phone
80:18 - that's a little much my little iphone
80:20 - and you can have pretty much your app
80:21 - running and you can have your android or
80:23 - ios app working on that and you can have
80:25 - for example whatsapp
80:27 - and you can have like your little chat
80:28 - going and guys you can see that like
80:30 - pretty much
80:31 - like it's it's a massive skill guys so
80:34 - react is not only going to allow you
80:36 - to be able to code really nice looking
80:38 - web apps
80:39 - but also stunning really powerful
80:42 - um react native apps okay
80:45 - um okay so let's see uh i'll tell you
80:48 - what guys let's actually have
80:50 - a bit of a q and a now so firstly i hope
80:53 - that let's actually just wrap this up a
80:55 - little bit
80:56 - right so three apps that you guys
80:59 - need to have in your portfolio which i
81:00 - can guarantee you will land you a
81:02 - amazing an amazing permanent position
81:05 - somewhere
81:06 - or a freelance contract or somebody that
81:08 - you're teaching
81:09 - um facebook messenger app it's going to
81:12 - demonstrate real time db a bunch of
81:14 - things and it's hosted online this is
81:16 - just a cool app to show guys
81:17 - like it's a really cool app to show the
81:19 - second one amazon
81:21 - amazon build right we have the react
81:23 - context api we have authentication we
81:25 - have firebase hosting we have
81:26 - react we have a responsive design you
81:29 - see like everything sort of resizes and
81:31 - looks beautiful
81:32 - if you guys are wondering why slices off
81:33 - at the sides that's actually a good
81:35 - design plan to do that
81:36 - so that's something which you can look
81:37 - into and like again it demonstrates that
81:40 - you know those things we have
81:41 - authentication we have the react context
81:42 - api
81:43 - everything works really nice even the
81:45 - the the header follows us down you see
81:46 - that
81:47 - awesome then we have netflix netflix is
81:50 - not only a
81:51 - beautiful looking app it's something
81:53 - which shows like look at that animation
81:55 - at the top a lovely animation at the top
81:57 - it pulls data in from a api so
82:00 - everything's sort of
82:01 - fresh and it's pulling it in you see how
82:03 - it's pulling all of this in it's
82:04 - responsive it looks beautiful looks
82:06 - amazing
82:07 - it's mobile friendly doesn't matter if
82:09 - we're in a mobile or if we're in a
82:10 - desktop it works
82:12 - and pretty much like you can click
82:13 - something and play it at this point and
82:15 - it will just work
82:16 - right so these three apps are going to
82:19 - demonstrate
82:19 - so much more than you could ever show
82:21 - and then a simple resume
82:23 - okay and that's really going to separate
82:25 - you from the rest of the crowd
82:27 - right so if you guys find if you guys
82:29 - found that cool and useful
82:31 - not only are these three apps amazing
82:33 - but guys we have live streams on
82:35 - every single app and you can go ahead
82:37 - and watch those
82:38 - right now on youtube for absolutely free
82:42 - they're absolutely free and you can go
82:44 - ahead and check that out
82:46 - and see you go ahead and check that out
82:48 - and build these for yourself
82:50 - in those live streams um so guys if you
82:52 - think that's pretty cool
82:54 - then drop a drop some comments in there
82:56 - to let me know if you found that useful

83:44 - this doesn't happen on youtube channels
83:46 - i haven't really seen any other coding

83:48 - like we're going to go ahead and give
83:50 - you guys personalized video feedback
83:52 - for all of the submissions that you uh

84:43 - profit with javascript it is literally
84:46 - game changer guys so i'm going to go
84:48 - ahead and get rid of this so profit with
84:49 - javascript guys it is a
84:51 - game changer where we have pretty much
84:53 - we are going to take you
84:55 - from being a complete beginner to
84:59 - landing your first client or position a
85:01 - lot of our students right now have
85:02 - actually got jobs they've got full-time
85:04 - jobs
85:04 - and i love love love to see that guys so
85:07 - when i see our
85:08 - students get jobs it makes my entire day
85:10 - like it makes my entire
85:12 - year for that like when i see somebody
85:13 - else that is making like money from the
85:15 - skills that we've been able to teach
85:16 - them
85:17 - it just blows my mind okay and it
85:18 - actually like it really really does give
85:20 - me like such a high
85:22 - um yeah and we pretty much have weekly
85:24 - coaching calls guys and these are really
85:26 - value-packed like these are honestly
85:28 - worth
85:29 - so a lot of our students say it's worth
85:30 - a 10k coding bootcamp like the
85:32 - equivalent of a 10k coding bootcamp
85:34 - um and guys we pretty much we don't just
85:36 - teach you how to code we teach you how
85:37 - to make money with it
85:38 - and that's what really separates us from
85:41 - everyone else out there and guys i can't
85:42 - stress it enough if you enjoyed this
85:44 - corn you found it useful
85:45 - and you want to get involved then guys
85:47 - 30-day money-back guarantee you can
85:49 - pretty much go ahead and check out the
85:50 - link in the description
85:51 - join and cancel on the 29th day if
85:53 - you're not happy with it so
85:54 - go ahead and give that a go um and
85:57 - you've got a bunch of stories on here
85:59 - about
85:59 - but these are pretty much these are
86:00 - actually clients that we've had uh
86:03 - and students that we've had on site on
86:05 - the course itself and
86:06 - somebody actually got a hundred and ten
86:08 - thousand guys
86:10 - so remember when you guys were like i
86:11 - can guarantee some of you guys were
86:12 - shocked when i showed you this
86:14 - right someone landed a contract for
86:18 - 110 000 guys
86:21 - like that's amazing that's insane like
86:24 - if anyone if
86:25 - you guys find that amazing like just
86:26 - drop some fire right now nazari
86:28 - drop he actually got a 110
86:32 - 000 contract like it blew
86:35 - my mind when i saw that so guys as i
86:38 - mentioned link in the description
86:39 - give me a check out if you're interested
86:41 - right so we are going to go
86:43 - on to a q a now so pretty much we're
86:46 - going to wrap up with a final q a
86:48 - and this is going to be a chance for me
86:50 - to be able to talk to you guys and be
86:51 - able to answer any questions that you
86:53 - guys have
86:54 - so let's go ahead and jump right in so
86:58 - guys just pretty much any questions at
87:00 - this point free fire if you want uh
87:02 - we're gonna go for about 10 minutes
87:04 - and we are pretty much going to answer
87:05 - any questions that we can
87:07 - in that time frame so let's have a look
87:09 - at what you have
87:10 - so somebody said build a portfolio with
87:12 - react
87:13 - 100 guys if you have a beautiful
87:15 - portfolio
87:16 - and you actually said this portfolio was
87:18 - built in react and it's deployed on
87:19 - firebase
87:20 - can you see how that's literally going
87:22 - to speak a thousand words in itself
87:23 - because it's literally going to be like
87:24 - oh the actual portfolio's built in react
87:27 - so definitely some good advice from
87:29 - alexandros right there
87:31 - um let's go and have a look so
87:35 - hi versatile this side from where can i
87:37 - learn javascript
87:38 - so as i mentioned you can pretty much
87:40 - either one watch the live streams
87:42 - there's plenty of free content out there
87:44 - we actually have plenty of free content
87:46 - on this channel
87:47 - um if you want to get involved in
87:49 - something more and you want to get
87:50 - involved in something which is like
87:52 - more sort of fulfilling and more sort of
87:54 - like community driven
87:55 - profit with javascript you can check
87:56 - that out in the description
87:59 - and also i would highly recommend that
88:00 - you actually go ahead and check out
88:02 - the live builds that we previously done
88:05 - uh in the last few days
88:06 - for where we built the three apps that
88:08 - we spoke about today
88:10 - and the ones are going to guarantee you
88:12 - a job as a
88:14 - developer okay um let's go and have a
88:17 - look
88:18 - so edwin asked a good question he said
88:22 - do you mean that for this type of
88:23 - project it's better to make our own back
88:25 - end
88:26 - and upload it to our own server and
88:28 - hosting so
88:31 - honestly guys at this point
88:35 - don't do that i would say go ahead and
88:38 - build projects show that you can code
88:39 - and react
88:40 - use firebase make your life super easy
88:42 - guys firebase
88:44 - makes it so easy to be able to actually
88:47 - deploy
88:48 - um an app to a website so if you watched
88:51 - some of the live calls
88:52 - uh previously we pretty much had we we
88:55 - got the app running
88:56 - and then once it was built we were able
88:57 - to deploy it super fast like it was
88:59 - unreal how quickly we got that thing up
89:01 - and running in the air
89:02 - if you want to make a change to it you
89:03 - can deploy it and everything will go
89:04 - really nice and smooth
89:06 - so yeah to answer that question you
89:07 - don't need to build your own backend
89:09 - use firebase as a nice quick solution to
89:11 - get that working
89:13 - uh that's really nice uh let's go and
89:16 - have a
89:16 - look so what is firebase uh yeah so
89:20 - firebase is a really good question
89:21 - what is firebase um so i think let's pin
89:25 - it right now so what is firebase so we
89:26 - have
89:27 - firebase is a suite of tools by google
89:29 - guys it's a highly
89:30 - uh wanted skill and it's coming up i can
89:32 - see a lot more job openings for it
89:34 - um it has authentication it has i'm just
89:37 - gonna go ahead and draw on the screen
89:38 - right now
89:39 - so it has it's a suite of tools by
89:42 - google it has authentication
89:44 - it has a database which is a real-time
89:46 - database guys where it literally
89:48 - gives you the functionality of this
89:49 - where pretty much as you type in
89:52 - and as you send messages you can see
89:53 - other people's messages which is awesome
89:56 - you have storage which is how we
89:58 - actually coded up an instagram clone
90:00 - previously in the week you have firebase
90:03 - hosting
90:04 - so you can pretty much deploy your app
90:05 - so like these three apps are hosted
90:06 - online
90:07 - right now and available for you guys
90:09 - you've got
90:10 - firebase cloud functions which are
90:12 - amazingly powerful and super scalable
90:15 - and you also have some amazing other
90:17 - stuff so you have like crashlytics
90:19 - analytics if you want to track how your
90:22 - company is growing you've got a b
90:23 - testing cloud messaging this is all in
90:25 - that message so like notifications
90:26 - sending notifications from a react
90:28 - native app
90:29 - um and guys remember and by the way it's
90:31 - worth mentioning that this is completely
90:33 - free
90:34 - so most of the stuff on firebase is
90:35 - completely free for what you're going to
90:37 - need so actually hosting your websites
90:39 - is free okay so that's going to really
90:41 - benefit a lot of you guys
90:43 - and make sure you definitely make take
90:44 - advantage of that um
90:46 - yeah and also you guys you've got
90:47 - machine learning so that this is a
90:48 - really really cool use case so like
90:50 - if we go ahead and click learn more i
90:51 - think they have an example here where
90:53 - they talk about it um
90:54 - you can pretty much have things like
90:56 - look you can have image recognition
90:58 - you can have like um like if you pass it
91:01 - a picture of like a picture you see it
91:03 - shows you
91:03 - what like it's got a sun it's got a
91:05 - cloud it's got sky hills it's got birds
91:07 - inside of it
91:08 - really really powerful stuff guys and
91:10 - this is all done with the very very
91:12 - simple
91:12 - uh installations and things like that so
91:15 - extremely powerful
91:16 - with firebase so uh bhagav asked is
91:20 - react jess and firesaw a good modern
91:22 - tech stack it is
91:24 - the most underrated i'm telling you guys
91:27 - i am predicting this react.js and
91:30 - firestore is a match made in heaven
91:31 - so a lot of people are going crazy with
91:33 - the man stack which is mongodb express
91:36 - react
91:37 - uh and the m uh actually i even i can't
91:39 - remember the exact thing but a lot of
91:41 - people go crazy over that yes you're
91:42 - gonna need to know that but react.js and
91:44 - firestore guys
91:45 - is a match made in heaven the apps that
91:48 - we built
91:48 - were just simply you can't build those
91:50 - things that quickly
91:52 - um with the previous way of doing things
