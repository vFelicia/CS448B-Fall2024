00:00 - a computer science degree
00:03 - now i'm here with my friend
00:06 - logan right here here right here my head
00:08 - my friend logan so logan
00:10 - go ahead and introduce yourself how are
00:11 - you doing i'm doing great nas thanks for
00:14 - giving me the invite here um i'm part of
00:17 - the profitable shortcut program over
00:18 - with clever programmer and i've been
00:20 - doing so since
00:20 - june i've learned a lot i get to work
00:22 - with people like kazi i get to work with
00:24 - people like
00:25 - sunny and nas and with michael if you
00:28 - know him and daniel as well he's been
00:30 - on a couple of our streams so all of
00:31 - it's really cool um in my day-to-day
00:33 - what i do is i work at a cultural
00:34 - organization and i kind of fit within
00:36 - the realm of i.t
00:38 - and data science so a lot of that is
00:40 - looking at our programmatic work
00:41 - making sure that the data aligns and
00:43 - we're moving in the right direction
00:44 - towards the outcomes you want to achieve
00:46 - so with that i'll pass back to you
00:49 - awesome logan sweet
00:50 - so today's topic is very quick very
00:53 - simple guys
00:54 - right is a computer science right for
00:57 - you that
00:58 - is the question drop that in the
00:59 - comments guys if you
01:01 - have a computer science degree or if
01:04 - you're planning on giving your getting
01:05 - computer science degree
01:06 - also drop in the comments if you do not
01:08 - want a computer science degree okay if
01:10 - you just want to be self-taught
01:12 - right it is your choice so wait hold on
01:15 - so that is what we're going to talk
01:16 - about today let's go ahead and really
01:18 - quickly and
01:19 - honestly really quickly get into it
01:22 - you guys hope you guys are pumped it's
01:25 - going to be a good one
01:26 - now very important before we go
01:29 - before we go very important we have
01:33 - a link down description for those of you
01:36 - who
01:36 - do want to be self-taught developers for
01:39 - those of you who
01:40 - are looking to become developers who
01:42 - want to become a react
01:43 - developers like me or login right here
01:47 - we have a link in the description for a
01:48 - web for a webinar
01:50 - on how to become a react js
01:55 - developer okay so go ahead
01:58 - link in description go check it out and
02:00 - we'll continue on
02:01 - with that all right logan let's go ahead
02:04 - and
02:04 - get into it so this computer's like
02:07 - science degree right
02:08 - for you logan do you have a computer
02:09 - science degree i do
02:11 - i actually i graduated in april of 2020
02:13 - so no convocation
02:14 - but i do have a computer science degree
02:17 - okay cool and i actually have a precise
02:19 - degree too but what i realized actually
02:20 - after time
02:21 - that i did not need my computer science
02:23 - degree pretty much at
02:24 - all because all of my jobs were from
02:26 - different things
02:28 - guys hi nas what is up roshan what is up
02:32 - ali what is up guys so good to see you
02:34 - all john samarth
02:35 - wolf wolf wolfgang says car looks what
02:39 - carlos says i do
02:40 - rashaan viction nikhil how are you doing
02:43 - guys so good to see you all
02:45 - all right let's get this going let's get
02:46 - this party started hey
02:50 - hopefully you guys can hear the sound
02:52 - effect so logan sorry you can't hear
02:53 - that but i can't
02:56 - all right so really quickly this
02:58 - computer says red degree for you
03:00 - yes or no i don't know
03:04 - maybe so
03:07 - um with that said well yes but actually
03:10 - no
03:11 - so what is computer science logan go
03:14 - ahead and give us the rundown
03:17 - here yeah for sure guys so if you if you
03:19 - google what is computer science you look
03:21 - for your
03:21 - dictionary the lines of like the study
03:24 - of you know
03:25 - computation um algorithms uh essentially
03:28 - like how computer architecture works
03:30 - and you know from basically the point at
03:31 - which you interact with the computer all
03:33 - the way through the
03:34 - circuiting in your computer and all the
03:35 - way back out to the monitor so it's kind
03:37 - of a holistic view of programming coding
03:39 - in general but also a theoretical
03:41 - approach too so we're going to be
03:42 - looking at
03:43 - or as a computer scientist sorry we'll
03:45 - look at stuff like mathematics and kind
03:46 - of like how can they best produce
03:48 - algorithms and such
03:49 - um making sure that they use most
03:50 - efficient or they do the best with the
03:52 - least amount of resources on there
03:55 - gotcha gotcha gotcha okay sweet sweet
03:57 - sweet oh let's get in let's get together
03:59 - so what can you do with cs guys that is
04:01 - the question okay
04:02 - obviously one thing here is one thing
04:04 - that i would like to say for me computer
04:05 - science
04:06 - is honestly for me computer science is
04:08 - like the way i see
04:09 - it is it it's like for me it's like
04:13 - being an inventor inventor
04:16 - i am not even kidding for me it's like
04:19 - being an inventor
04:20 - right you have this this you have this
04:23 - power in your mind to just simply
04:27 - basically create anything you want
04:29 - with simply just code like how powerful
04:33 - is that okay that's what i see that's
04:36 - what i see computer science as okay
04:38 - now let's go ahead keep going so right
04:40 - it's just some examples right some
04:41 - examples
04:43 - what can you do computer science logan
04:45 - obviously we can do we can
04:46 - build applications like tesla you can
04:48 - build applications like
04:49 - netflix you can build applications like
04:51 - facebook what other locations can you
04:53 - build
04:54 - uh you can build all kinds of
04:56 - applications so i mean we have a whole
04:58 - spectrum
04:59 - a lot of what we do at clever programmer
05:00 - is going to be web development so
05:02 - actually you'll be doing stuff like
05:03 - websites full stack development
05:05 - previous streams that we've been having
05:06 - and even this react challenge we're
05:08 - doing full stack applications with
05:09 - stripe integration
05:10 - we're building effectively an e-commerce
05:12 - site but i mean it's not limited to this
05:13 - we could do
05:14 - mobile development we could do desktop
05:17 - application development we can do video
05:19 - games um it really
05:20 - the the ends of which your imagination
05:22 - can go to there's no limit at a limit
05:24 - gotcha gotcha yeah something we have uh
05:27 - says
05:28 - um i will study software engineering
05:30 - next four years at 39. that's amazing
05:32 - wow i love that um wow at 39 that's
05:36 - awesome that's awesome so
05:37 - uh yeah like so many opportunities out
05:39 - here guys everything around
05:40 - at this point is i mean is electronic it
05:43 - is digital
05:44 - you know as as we are talking to you
05:46 - through this camera and you guys can see
05:48 - us
05:48 - right on youtube all of this computer
05:50 - science all of that is through software
05:52 - development and i'm sure you guys
05:53 - already know because you guys are on
05:54 - here
05:54 - and this is why you're watching am i
05:56 - right like why are you watching this
05:57 - otherwise
05:58 - like literally like why are you watching
06:00 - this let me know in the comments below
06:01 - i'm actually pretty curious so
06:05 - so that is the very interesting part of
06:07 - course right so
06:08 - so with that said with that said really
06:10 - quickly let's keep going
06:12 - um all right top pane titles for cs
06:15 - background here's some topping uh you
06:18 - know uh titles we got
06:19 - net developer number 10 around 94 000
06:22 - per year
06:23 - that is just simply insane we also have
06:26 - uh it
06:26 - what is an iet auditor uh i'm not sure
06:30 - exactly but if i had to guess an it
06:32 - auditor would be someone who you know is
06:34 - obviously working with the it space and
06:36 - one probably is taking accounts of kind
06:38 - of like what is necessary what is needed
06:39 - as far as infrastructure with uh with
06:41 - organizations
06:42 - uh that would be my guess gotcha these
06:45 - are all
06:45 - these are all stolen from indeed guys so
06:47 - if you go to that uh link up in the top
06:48 - you'll be able to find the exact article
06:50 - that i posted
06:50 - yeah yeah somebody's like data
06:52 - scientists love ali says yeah
06:54 - this size is pretty cool i like that too
06:56 - trust me all right i t auditor wait hold
06:58 - on let me
06:59 - yeah this is this is it right here next
07:01 - time we got front end developer guys
07:03 - which is
07:03 - all front developer i know you guys are
07:04 - in for that a lot that's where you guys
07:06 - will
07:06 - join the react.js challenge but really
07:09 - if you have not joined the react.js
07:10 - webinar link in description below
07:13 - but from developer of course we have
07:15 - national average salary for that
07:17 - front developer is gonna be a hundred
07:18 - and two thousand dollars which is just
07:20 - whoa that's insane that's pretty dang
07:23 - good
07:23 - um honestly um so front developers
07:26 - include things like right if you're a
07:27 - react developer
07:28 - if you are an angular developer so right
07:31 - that's for
07:32 - for example like right react
07:36 - right if you're like angular right
07:39 - anything that has to do with right with
07:42 - what development that's going to be a
07:43 - front web developer
07:45 - credit login yes yes correct yeah
07:48 - cool all right then you got a java
07:50 - developer right then get around 103
07:53 - 000 and then you got yourself a software
07:55 - engineer so what is a soft engineer what
07:56 - is the big difference between
07:58 - there a software engineer is kind of a
08:01 - very broad
08:01 - look at basically it's all it's almost
08:04 - like you have to be the person that goes
08:05 - out finds the client listens to them
08:07 - about what they want
08:08 - gets an idea of their needs kind of goes
08:10 - back with your project manager
08:12 - comes up with the idea about what
08:13 - product is going to make sense and work
08:15 - for them
08:16 - create a budget a project timeline let's
08:18 - create the creator
08:19 - project you're the software engineer and
08:21 - then kind of make sure it goes back to
08:22 - the client
08:23 - so the software engineer is really about
08:24 - like creating applications that are you
08:27 - know for commercial use
08:29 - got it so okay complicate applications
08:31 - for commercial
08:33 - use but it's also very general a general
08:35 - name in general as well right so with
08:37 - job engineering like when you search up
08:38 - on google you're searching for a
08:40 - software
08:40 - general engineer and that can pretty
08:42 - much lead you to anywhere that you want
08:44 - to go
08:44 - solve the front end development back in
08:46 - development right and so forth
08:47 - then you got yourself a network security
08:49 - engineer right here at around 115 000
08:52 - then you have yourself a mobile
08:53 - developer 150 000
08:55 - average salary that is insane guys
08:58 - okay then you got yourself a data
09:00 - scientist 121 thousand dollar salary
09:04 - wow data scientist honestly one wow and
09:06 - that's probably going to go up
09:07 - as well you know that you got a dev ops
09:11 - engineer what is the devil switching can
09:12 - you explain that really quickly
09:14 - yeah for sure so guys if you've never
09:16 - heard devops before
09:18 - um that's okay if you've heard of it and
09:20 - you're familiar with what an it
09:21 - professional does think you're in luck
09:23 - a devops engineer is essentially an i.t
09:25 - person on steroids so if you can think
09:27 - whereas it is going to be helping people
09:29 - who are you know working with microsoft
09:31 - office applications
09:33 - or if an it professionals can be someone
09:35 - who installs windows on your laptop for
09:37 - your co-worker
09:38 - a dev ops engineer is someone who's
09:39 - going to take that to the next level
09:40 - they're going to be working directly
09:41 - with developers and what they're going
09:42 - to do is
09:43 - they're going to be doing stuff like
09:44 - setting up virtual machines
09:46 - like ubuntu operating systems on virtual
09:48 - machines on like amazon
09:50 - web services they're going to be setting
09:52 - up teams of developers making sure that
09:53 - they're all ready it's going to be
09:54 - managing
09:56 - all the version control and making sure
09:57 - that that's all functioning correctly
09:59 - but holistically what it's really trying
10:00 - to do is
10:02 - really push towards that philosophy of
10:04 - continuous development and continuous
10:06 - integration that we'll cover later in
10:07 - the slides
10:08 - yeah exactly exactly so for those of you
10:10 - i'm actually really curious guys who
10:12 - here is kind of going towards more like
10:14 - which side are you going more towards
10:16 - right
10:16 - i know a lot of you guys are front-end
10:17 - developers a lot of you guys are going
10:18 - to become react
10:19 - professional developers you guys because
10:22 - you guys joined the react
10:23 - gs challenge and built the amazon clone
10:26 - i know that for sure
10:27 - um but yeah let us let us know in the
10:30 - comments
10:30 - below right here and let us know what
10:33 - field
10:34 - are you more interested in right so
10:36 - that's going to be the interesting part
10:38 - on the other than that let's continue on
10:39 - so we have devops and then and the last
10:40 - one's going to be
10:41 - software architect and what is the
10:42 - software archetype really quickly
10:45 - yeah so if you guys don't know daniel i
10:47 - believe daniel's job is quite relevant
10:48 - to software architecture but the idea
10:50 - behind software architecture is it's
10:52 - kind of like aligning the stacks of
10:53 - technology and making sure that they all
10:55 - make sense
10:56 - so it's um you know it's going to be
10:58 - like oh you want to build an application
11:00 - stack which is like mongodb express um
11:03 - react and sorry what's the last one i
11:05 - can't remember but anyways
11:06 - it's like are we going to do that or
11:07 - we're going to switch up our pern stack
11:09 - which is switching out [ __ ] for
11:10 - postgres so it's kind of like stuff like
11:12 - that but we're doing it large scale
11:13 - we're working with really big
11:14 - applications that could use 40 different
11:16 - pieces of technology and we need to kind
11:18 - of see how they all fit together and we
11:19 - need to work within that space
11:21 - yeah so it's like for the way i see the
11:23 - way i see
11:24 - software architecture and the way i know
11:26 - because i've done software carter
11:28 - is for example you've been able to
11:30 - understand the whole big picture of
11:32 - the a piece of software right so right
11:34 - the way i see it it's like
11:35 - you being it's like um if you have
11:38 - the architect right an architect goes in
11:41 - has the plans for the house right land
11:43 - lays out the plans for the house
11:45 - it's kind of like that so plans it's
11:47 - kind of like creating the plans
11:49 - for the house right kind of kind of like
11:52 - that right you know how you have that
11:53 - drawing right
11:54 - for the plans of the house it's a
11:55 - similar situation in an architecture and
11:58 - when you design software architecture
12:00 - especially when you're
12:01 - going into building huge applications
12:03 - you can design software
12:05 - architecture you're going to look into
12:07 - okay what is my
12:08 - okay where is my front end contained
12:10 - right in that front end how does my
12:12 - front end look like
12:13 - how am i going to how how
12:16 - am i going to actually lay out all the
12:19 - files for my front end for this
12:21 - developers to go ahead and develop
12:24 - on when i did here's an example when i
12:27 - did for when i did
12:28 - soft architecture for an application
12:30 - this was back back then
12:31 - like i was doing it for service.com this
12:33 - was a really cool app that we were
12:35 - building
12:36 - and i literally had to lay out okay how
12:38 - is
12:39 - how are we going to test our app how are
12:42 - we going to
12:43 - you know um how is the application going
12:45 - to be divided
12:47 - up for example i'm going to have this
12:49 - folder i'm going to have
12:50 - the folder for all of my components i'm
12:52 - going to have all the folder
12:54 - for all of my kind of big picture
12:57 - application pages
12:58 - which is for example the home page the
12:59 - about us page right
13:01 - you know the dashboard page and so forth
13:04 - and the the naming convention behind it
13:07 - was very
13:08 - also was very thought out right so it's
13:11 - being able to understand that naming
13:12 - convention how does your application
13:15 - the layout of your application all of
13:18 - that right because that's very important
13:20 - logan that is very important the way i
13:22 - see right it's very important because
13:24 - if your develop application development
13:27 - like
13:28 - the application you're working on is
13:30 - hard to develop on because the files are
13:32 - all over the place there's no
13:34 - proper standards for how things should
13:36 - be
13:37 - it's just going to be a mess it's going
13:39 - to be
13:40 - a mess and that probably only gets worse
13:43 - the larger your application gets so you
13:45 - know like we all love free to creep we
13:46 - all love continually adding
13:48 - only working with but you know if if you
13:50 - don't have a strong architecture
13:51 - those problems are going to get massive
13:53 - and we have a big bubble when it pops
13:54 - it's going to look like a nightmare
13:56 - exactly sweet so let's continue on all
13:57 - right so the first thing that we got
14:00 - the first thing we got is going to be
14:02 - web
14:03 - development guys i know you a lot of you
14:05 - guys are web developers here or
14:07 - want to become a developer let me know
14:08 - in the comments below if that is my
14:10 - correct
14:10 - understanding but in my development
14:13 - obviously you know some of the
14:14 - technology stacks that we're going to
14:16 - use
14:16 - is for example like obviously html a css
14:19 - right let's go back css javascript right
14:22 - in terms of frameworks
14:23 - you know frameworks you're going to use
14:25 - things like react angular
14:27 - vue.js and so forth those are probably
14:28 - the topmost three
14:30 - but the best one as we know is which one
14:34 - it's react boys you know it it is react
14:38 - exactly
14:38 - we're a big fan of this i know sonny's
14:40 - big a big fan of that guys drop us on
14:42 - fire for
14:42 - react and for sunny down in the comments
14:45 - below
14:46 - sweet so now i want to dig deeper in
14:48 - terms of
14:49 - what are some requirements right because
14:50 - we want to introduce you guys like what
14:52 - do companies actually look for
14:54 - what it comes to actually look for when
14:55 - they are searching for
14:57 - right web developers right and
15:00 - the big thing that i would say we've
15:02 - laid out some of these
15:04 - big specific requirements so logan
15:07 - give us some examples what do you think
15:11 - yeah for sure let's walk through the the
15:13 - text on the left hand side
15:14 - so this is going to be for react js
15:17 - developer position
15:18 - and i pulled this off of linkedin from a
15:19 - canadian company up here and so if we
15:21 - just look through the bullet points
15:22 - you're going to see some things you're
15:23 - probably already familiar with so what
15:25 - they're looking for is they're looking
15:26 - for knowledge of javascript
15:28 - css html and they say and foreign
15:31 - languages but you guys know that
15:32 - everything is kind of like javascript
15:34 - css html we just work within frameworks
15:36 - knowledge of react tools you guys are
15:38 - learning that when you're doing your
15:39 - react challenge when you're following
15:40 - our buildings on the
15:41 - youtube channel you're learning react
15:43 - tools you're learning things that are
15:44 - going to be relevant to this position
15:46 - such as react
15:47 - redux and working within um the context
15:49 - api uh
15:50 - going down you're probably going to need
15:51 - some general knowledge of interface
15:53 - design you're going to have to know how
15:54 - to kind of like structure things lay
15:55 - them out use things like um
15:57 - adobe xd working within that creating
16:00 - awesome prototypes and wireframes
16:02 - um you're gonna have to know how to
16:03 - debug things within the browser which
16:05 - means
16:05 - your knowledge of the browser and a
16:07 - little bit of how the internet works
16:08 - should also be up there
16:09 - and the rest is kind of like good
16:11 - communication skills of course and i i
16:12 - want to drop it drop to the last bullet
16:14 - point which is an important one
16:16 - get and knowledge of version control is
16:18 - a critical part of how you get yourself
16:20 - to the next level where people are going
16:22 - to be willing to give you a job inside
16:23 - the
16:24 - inside the space so really guys if
16:27 - if if you're just starting out as a
16:30 - programmer what i want you to do is i
16:31 - want you to really take this to heart
16:33 - every time you work on a project i want
16:35 - you to initialize a git repository and i
16:36 - want you to regularly commit your code
16:39 - updates to your repository
16:41 - every time you enter in like a new
16:42 - module anytime you enter in a new class
16:45 - and you know it works you've tested it
16:47 - do it git commit make sure you save it
16:49 - then what i want you to do make a github
16:51 - account push everything to your github
16:53 - make sure those repositories are public
16:55 - and people can see that
17:00 - so just to recap kind of which i was
17:01 - like oh i'm not on my meter right now so
17:03 - just to recap
17:04 - what you guys need is one number one
17:06 - obviously we talked about right
17:07 - javascript css html
17:08 - right you need to know a little bit of
17:10 - ui ux design right so that comes with
17:12 - experience
17:13 - you need to know obviously javascript
17:14 - css html right there
17:16 - these three components are the core
17:18 - pillars and there's actually something
17:19 - that we teach
17:20 - you know we teach in profit with
17:22 - javascript which by the way we're going
17:23 - to launch
17:24 - um on sunday september 13
17:28 - at the webinar which go ahead and sign
17:30 - up for the webinar we're going to be
17:31 - launching pwj
17:32 - profit with javascript on that day where
17:35 - we you guys will
17:36 - where you guys will be able to actually
17:38 - learn technologies like react
17:39 - technologies like css
17:40 - html javascript and become web
17:42 - developers if that is what you want to
17:44 - be
17:44 - okay so now with that we know besides
17:47 - obviously reacting ui ux
17:48 - right we talked about a little bit about
17:50 - version control which is obviously the
17:51 - very important part
17:52 - right version control making sure that
17:55 - you can
17:56 - save your code and you know have
17:57 - different versions of your code very
17:59 - important
18:00 - right we also talk about what's another
18:02 - thing that you really need to know
18:03 - uh you need to know rest right so rest
18:06 - is also very important
18:07 - right being able to create like apis as
18:09 - a web developer
18:11 - um another big thing you know really
18:13 - important is what anything else
18:15 - event handling we need to know dom
18:16 - manipulation
18:18 - understand how to change node elements
18:19 - inside the browser dom manipulation
18:21 - right very important as well but right
18:24 - behind the core
18:25 - pillars uh behind all of this right
18:27 - you're probably thinking yourself oh
18:28 - there's so much to learn like what do i
18:30 - do
18:30 - right with that um well honestly
18:35 - learning this stuff guys is actually not
18:37 - that
18:38 - hard this stuff will come through time
18:41 - as you build what as you build
18:45 - projects guys rogers projects boom
18:49 - right there as you build projects guys
18:52 - that is the core
18:53 - the core view talk about so much
18:57 - here you have no idea right so that's
18:59 - how we built amazon clone that's how we
19:00 - introduced amazon clone with this
19:01 - reaction challenge and so forth because
19:03 - all of that gets built all the knowledge
19:05 - you will accumulate over time right so
19:08 - don't when you see this kind of stuff
19:09 - don't think that oh
19:10 - there's so much stuff to learn just
19:13 - think of it as like you know what it's
19:14 - good a little opportunity this can be
19:15 - fun
19:15 - let's get into it alright next up now
19:17 - question is do you need a degree
19:20 - i don't know do you need a hug hey
19:24 - it's a relatable feeling you know you
19:26 - never want to be in that position like
19:28 - you need to go out and do four years of
19:30 - work that's tough
19:32 - yeah uh a beat is like um abit is like
19:35 - i'm learning coding for fun
19:36 - uh space cadets is like i am pumped
19:39 - let's
19:39 - go let's go let's go c4 co says version
19:42 - control is

20:02 - is like lagging short answer is no you
20:04 - do not
20:05 - need a degree guys okay
20:08 - these days have a degree in computer
20:09 - science is not a requirement as you guys
20:11 - can see
20:12 - to find a job in web development okay
20:14 - there are many ways to teach yourself
20:16 - online right which is
20:17 - you know through pretty much anything
20:18 - through youtube if you you can teach
20:19 - yourself through youtube you can teach
20:21 - yourself the profit of droughts
20:22 - which by the way we are launching
20:24 - september 13th so make sure you join
20:27 - the webinar down below link in
20:28 - description okay all right
20:30 - also for example by so just for that
20:33 - according to last year's study and by
20:34 - stack overflow almost 70 percent
20:37 - 70 right 70 let me just put that
20:41 - on here 70
20:44 - right of all developers are at least
20:46 - partly self-taught
20:51 - yeah that's something i want to that's
20:53 - something i want to talk about
20:56 - degree we can all share with those who
20:58 - don't that
21:00 - there's no end the amount of self-taught
21:03 - content that you're gonna have to be
21:04 - going for you know it's not as if by the
21:06 - end of a comp sci degree
21:07 - you've learned everything you need to
21:08 - know and you're good for the workforce
21:11 - actually what tends to happen is you
21:13 - really realize how much you don't know
21:15 - and like everyone else you're still
21:16 - stuck googling things constantly
21:17 - um we're always going to be
21:19 - self-teaching ourselves
21:21 - exactly exactly i personally am
21:23 - partially basically
21:24 - 80 for me is you know i'm self-taught as
21:26 - well
21:27 - logan i feel like you're pretty much
21:28 - self-taught too right yeah i mean in the
21:31 - evenings i'll be transparent with you
21:32 - guys i'm learning machine learning on
21:33 - udemy so that's my self-taught i'm
21:35 - extending
21:36 - the education that i got formally and
21:37 - i'm making sure that it goes in the
21:39 - distance
21:40 - it's so crazy rashaan rashan says myuni
21:42 - teaches one class
21:43 - another in four-year curriculum that is
21:46 - insane
21:47 - wow that is insane so yeah guys right 70
21:51 - moldova was at least self-taught with 13
21:53 - of respondents saying they are
21:55 - exclusively self-taught less than half
21:57 - have a degree in computer science or a
21:59 - related field less than half
22:01 - of all developers
22:04 - have a computer science degree which is
22:07 - dang
22:08 - right i think that just says a lot right
22:10 - and specifically now as we kind of go
22:12 - forward check this out guys
22:14 - right so google here right google here
22:15 - says will you so
22:17 - do you want any computer science degree
22:18 - to be a google software engineer
22:21 - no your cs degree does not require
22:24 - so no a cs degree isn't required for our
22:26 - soft engineering or product
22:28 - managing roles right just
22:31 - like i mean that's it right there guys
22:35 - they say it in clear text
22:36 - you do not need a degree to work at
22:37 - google and it's actually really funny
22:39 - because they changed this specifically
22:40 - they changed this not too long ago this
22:42 - whole thing where
22:43 - you know you need computer science
22:45 - degree google facebook right
22:47 - all these companies said ah sayonara
22:50 - baby
22:50 - we don't need your degree i don't know
22:53 - why i just said it like that
22:56 - but you get my point you get my
22:58 - appointment
23:00 - all right let's keep going so google for
23:01 - example here's an ex here's a good
23:03 - example from google
23:04 - software is a front-end developer right
23:07 - you know you can
23:08 - they say here for example you do need a
23:09 - bachelor's degree in computer science or
23:11 - a really technical field or
23:14 - right here let me make sure you guys can
23:15 - see that every equivalent practical
23:17 - experience
23:18 - one year of work experience right so
23:20 - experience
23:21 - counts so much more than for example
23:24 - like a computer science degree they talk
23:25 - about here right
23:27 - and they're looking for experience in
23:28 - javascript and one or more programming
23:30 - languages including but not limited to
23:32 - like cc plus plus python or go
23:34 - right so and i was thinking to do things
23:36 - like html css and so forth right so
23:39 - that is that is the big key here you
23:41 - guys are laughing at my
23:43 - a lot of you guys are like laughing at
23:44 - my uh funny funny funny way i say things
23:47 - um apple go ahead talk us through a
23:50 - little bit through here
23:52 - yeah for sure so this position here uh
23:54 - if you can read from the top is for user
23:56 - interface and front end
23:57 - engineer it's at apple um and so if you
24:00 - look at it here
24:00 - there is no specific mention in the key
24:03 - qualifications to do with education
24:05 - they don't ask for that instead what
24:06 - they're asking for is five plus years of
24:08 - software development experience
24:10 - how do you get exterior experience it
24:12 - can really be anything you know
24:13 - you build projects at home you work with
24:15 - employer really as long as you're
24:17 - working within the space and working on
24:19 - your technical skills
24:20 - uh as we go down it looks like
24:23 - specifically for
24:24 - a couple frameworks angular preferred
24:26 - but could be react could be used so
24:28 - there you go those are the top three
24:29 - frameworks if you know any of those
24:30 - three you're probably going to be able
24:31 - to answer some really relevant interview
24:33 - questions with apple
24:34 - uh yeah and as you go down it looks like
24:37 - there's a little bit of api
24:38 - integration so if you guys are familiar
24:39 - with apis how to set that up in full
24:41 - stack applications you're even more
24:42 - enriched you're going to be even a
24:44 - better applicant for a front-end
24:45 - engineer position with apple
24:47 - yeah so api we talked about api we
24:49 - talked about you know react
24:51 - we talked about you know angular right
24:53 - we talked about
24:54 - right just experience experience in
24:57 - general right
24:58 - all those things are going to get very
24:59 - big for these companies next up netflix
25:01 - for example
25:02 - senior software engineer okay does not
25:04 - require a degree seeing yourself
25:07 - seeing your software engineer does not
25:08 - require a degree
25:10 - like what that is right like you think
25:13 - like that
25:13 - that old wise wizard who sits in the
25:15 - back he's got that old graveyard 60
25:17 - years old like knows everything you
25:19 - think he has like
25:20 - a master's at least a bachelor's but no
25:22 - actually yeah he doesn't require that
25:24 - yeah yeah yeah so
25:25 - yeah single full stack engineer with
25:26 - five plus years of experience so you
25:28 - that's what they're looking for they're
25:29 - looking for experience right in any
25:30 - specific company let me go ahead and
25:32 - drag me down a little bit here um right
25:34 - they're looking for just simple
25:35 - experience guys you know
25:37 - any job that i apply to they're always
25:39 - looking hey
25:40 - what have you actually
25:44 - done what have you actually done that is
25:47 - a big question
25:48 - okay so uh netflix senior level engineer
25:51 - strong and java javascript css html
25:53 - react
25:53 - react node.js another javascript
25:56 - frameworks and you know for example if
25:57 - you can build
25:58 - restful apis that is amazing too which
25:59 - by the way we teach you all of that
26:02 - in profit or javascript again we're
26:03 - launching that i know um
26:05 - in our webinar on september 13th so make
26:08 - sure you join the webinar on how to
26:09 - become
26:10 - a react javascript developer link

26:16 - on
26:17 - uh next up we have facebook go ahead and
26:19 - run us through this one logan
26:20 - yeah for sure so again guys this is a
26:23 - front-end engineer position at facebook
26:26 - so let's jump down to the minimum
26:27 - qualifications
26:28 - right away we see that they're looking
26:29 - for five plus years of experience in
26:31 - three different fields but nowhere in
26:33 - particular are they looking for it as a
26:34 - qualification or a requirement
26:36 - what they want is they want you to know
26:37 - javascript they want you to know
26:39 - asynchronous programming they want you
26:40 - to know closures and they want you to
26:41 - know es6
26:42 - they also want you to know your html and
26:44 - your css they want you to know it well
26:46 - at the very bottom they want you to know
26:47 - how to work with apis in the browser how
26:49 - to get information from other servers if
26:51 - you know that you know those three
26:52 - categories
26:53 - you're set up where you're reading that
26:54 - by the way where do you read that es6
26:56 - all this stuff
26:57 - oh yeah closures types and cs6 i'm like
27:00 - wait where is this coming from
27:04 - okay i got it i got i got it by the way
27:06 - frankie frankie um
27:07 - just want to say bless you yeah so he
27:09 - sneezed
27:13 - all right so five years of javascript
27:14 - experience it's insane again they don't
27:16 - talk about
27:17 - you know the computer science degree
27:18 - which is you know again it's great it's
27:20 - great to hear that companies are finally
27:21 - switching
27:22 - next up let's go ahead and do a
27:24 - different route now a little bit guys
27:26 - this r is going to be towards video game
27:27 - developers drop in the comments
27:31 - drop in the comments guys if you want to
27:33 - become video
27:34 - game developers or has it have thought
27:36 - about that right because that still
27:38 - is also a possibility right in what
27:41 - development there's just so many fields
27:43 - to go into and that's just one of the
27:44 - paths that you can go in
27:46 - right now very important guys before we
27:49 - go on
27:49 - right very important i will say that
27:51 - right we talk about you don't need a
27:53 - degree you don't need a degree right
27:54 - so forth right degree is still helpful
27:56 - that's still fine so if you have a
27:57 - degree
27:58 - that's all good i have a degree logan
28:00 - has a degree a lot of you guys might
28:02 - still want to get a degree that's not
28:04 - that's not a problem
28:05 - um but one thing for certain is that you
28:08 - still
28:09 - need hard work period okay
28:12 - so you still need hard work uh you know
28:16 - at the end of the day that's what
28:17 - matters okay guys
28:19 - so with video game development here you
28:21 - know uh somebody says elias says
28:23 - i'm currently into unreal engine that is
28:25 - amazing
28:26 - uh we have here uh alexander says i have
28:30 - 15 year olds
28:31 - alexander says i have i'm 15 years old i
28:33 - have touched html cc plus plus and
28:35 - javascript so forth
28:36 - that's awesome that's awesome uh we also
28:38 - have
28:39 - anna's says just be trying to
28:42 - challenge myself yes yes yes yes
28:47 - who else who else was who else wants to
28:49 - become a game developer guys huh
28:52 - let us know down in the description
28:54 - below but let's continue on with this so
28:56 - with video game development you and
28:58 - maybe know this a little bit more
28:59 - uh logan let's kind of like run us
29:01 - through this
29:02 - for sure guys sorry sorry the call cut
29:05 - out for a second so i don't know where
29:06 - we're at
29:06 - exactly but i'll give you a little run
29:08 - down about video game development
29:09 - so when i did my degree i did take a
29:11 - course on video game development and
29:12 - that
29:13 - game development was using unity if you
29:15 - google unity it's an open source game
29:17 - engine that anyone can download anyone
29:19 - can work with and anyone can learn from
29:21 - using the tutorials on unity's website
29:23 - you can build all kinds of games and the
29:25 - ones that i want you to think about
29:27 - are all the games that you see on steam
29:29 - all the games that you see on epic games
29:31 - all those indie games that are made by
29:32 - small studio studios and testing ten
29:34 - people
29:35 - yeah look at this guys just some just
29:36 - just some examples of games built by
29:38 - unity okay
29:39 - i personally have not built games any by
29:41 - unity but i have friends who built it
29:43 - and it is unreal in terms of what you
29:45 - can do with it just an example here
29:47 - nomads island um b-max oh there we go i
29:51 - love
29:52 - i love baymax sender trinity we also
29:55 - have
29:56 - coco vr no way guys who here has done vr
29:59 - that is insane
30:00 - uh battle scar right and so many more
30:03 - applications
30:04 - right drone um rick and morty virtual
30:08 - recruit
30:08 - no way he did not know that was building
30:10 - a big game that's in that showcase by
30:12 - the way if anyone is
30:13 - a big um person on twitch escape from
30:16 - tarkov is a
30:16 - big big game that was number one on
30:18 - twitch as far as streaming which one
30:20 - where is it where is
30:24 - there you go one with the guns the guy
30:26 - wearing the hat looks it's key from
30:27 - torco this one
30:28 - oh damn that that's a huge game that one
30:31 - was number one streamed on twitch for
30:33 - at least two months maybe summer last
30:35 - year and so
30:36 - unity unity is definitely more than
30:38 - powerful to create games that i go to go
30:40 - to the top of the charts and make you
30:41 - tons of income
30:43 - nice nice nice nice beautiful guys so
30:45 - it's like it's a very powerful tool so
30:46 - if you're looking into one
30:47 - game development definitely look into
30:51 - you know unity that is going to be a
30:52 - very powerful tool for you and then you
30:53 - can obviously
30:54 - you know go on to different other
30:56 - technologies in terms of building
30:57 - games so let's go back to our
30:59 - presentation here um
31:00 - just an example you know some games
31:02 - develop by is like harsh stone
31:05 - i see i'm not a game developer wait hold
31:07 - on i'm just making sure i'm sure
31:08 - actually showing you
31:09 - hearthstone so i'm actually not a game
31:11 - developer but
31:12 - um you know uh you know yeah
31:15 - not again available but i appreciate how
31:18 - much time and work it takes to build
31:19 - this stuff
31:23 - i listed some resources for you guys if
31:24 - you're on the stream you want to know
31:25 - where can i learn game development so i
31:27 - have them just at the bottom
31:28 - so if you're doing unity they have
31:30 - tutorials that are freely available
31:32 - for you to learn unity on their website
31:33 - website they're very good they're
31:35 - actually the ones that my professor had
31:36 - us
31:36 - use to learn the content for our course
31:38 - and they did very well yeah
31:40 - let's look at some job requirements guys
31:42 - so for what i've seen with job
31:43 - requirements
31:44 - i've seen that yes some do require a
31:46 - degree for example here
31:48 - right edition is open to recent
31:49 - undergraduates and a recent
31:51 - graduates so some do require a degree
31:53 - but not again not all require a degree
31:56 - it's very important
31:57 - i want to actually really quickly go
31:59 - into it and actually find
32:00 - i actually want to find you know uh a
32:03 - game development position
32:04 - right game development job with you guys
32:07 - so gaming development job and see
32:09 - what they got for example junior game
32:11 - developer right here
32:12 - santa monica because we're currently
32:14 - right near los angeles
32:15 - junior game developer let's see what
32:17 - they got so junior can develop a
32:18 - mob crush mob crush let's go
32:23 - they're just the best names i'll just
32:25 - love their names let's go
32:32 - um this just sounds so good
32:35 - let's see so job description santa
32:37 - monica
32:38 - work in the development team let's see
32:41 - let's see let's see
32:42 - so for example responsibilities
32:45 - preferred skills bachelor computer
32:46 - science or games
32:47 - better besides game technology some it
32:49 - looks like some do require
32:50 - a bachelor's degree let's see what else
32:52 - we got uh do we have any that don't
32:54 - require a bachelor's degree i'm sure we
32:56 - do a senior game developer that will
32:57 - probably require a degree
32:59 - let me see let me see bachelor's degree
33:01 - or equivalent experience right so this
33:03 - is what a lot of people are saying now
33:04 - right
33:05 - or equivalent experience bachelor's
33:07 - bachelors in computer science or
33:08 - equivalent
33:09 - experience so right here senior game
33:12 - engineer at play
33:13 - q what about like unix unix um let's see
33:17 - uh unix unity
33:21 - unity game developer
33:29 - yeah yeah yeah just fix your typo
33:32 - oh shoot you don't need good phone you
33:34 - don't need to find him
33:35 - you're going to find
33:46 - there you go my bad bro all right and
33:48 - promote unity game developer let's see
33:50 - uh create unit test validation remote
33:53 - unity game developer it doesn't really
33:54 - say what the requirements are for this
33:56 - specific one
33:56 - software development engineer and test
33:59 - that's actually at
34:00 - unity wow that's going to be an epic one
34:03 - actually at
34:04 - unity applying linkedin this one should
34:07 - be run
34:07 - apply to remote let's see let me see let
34:11 - me see
34:12 - this is the one remote unity game
34:13 - developer
34:16 - doesn't really say what it just simply
34:18 - says
34:20 - c sharp expert c sharp expert right
34:22 - there
34:23 - that's what it says let's see umd
34:25 - developer left field labs
34:34 - let's see let's see they give keep going
34:35 - could be all responsibilities
34:38 - this one says also computer science
34:39 - agree a acrylic degree dang really game
34:42 - developers come on
34:43 - tone it down a little bit they're a
34:45 - little stingy man everybody was stingy
34:48 - i'm like
34:48 - i almost kind of want to become a
34:49 - gandalf but just to prove it to them
34:51 - that you know you don't even agree for
34:52 - that [ __ ]
34:53 - i'm sorry for me for cussing you
34:54 - definitely don't
34:57 - let's see i'm sure we can find something
34:59 - i'm sure you can find something
35:01 - right there all they're looking for is
35:02 - five years
35:04 - of they're looking for five years of
35:07 - professional work experiences
35:10 - bachelor's degree or related something
35:11 - related to bachelor's degree yeah so
35:13 - you can say forget developers it's like
35:14 - it's like iffy sometimes they need to
35:16 - decrease sometimes they do not
35:17 - but there's still a lot of possibilities
35:19 - at the end of the day if you know what
35:21 - you're doing
35:21 - and you build something amazing you're
35:23 - going to get it no matter what so that's
35:25 - one thing to consider
35:27 - all right let's continue on really
35:29 - quickly here so we got
35:31 - game development guys i know you said a
35:33 - lot of you guys have talked about a lot
35:34 - of a lot of you here
35:35 - in this chat actually want to become
35:36 - game developers which could be fine um
35:38 - you know you guys all want to become
35:40 - react.js developers right there
35:43 - let's go ahead yeah so and based on some
35:45 - statistics fork and development looks
35:47 - like we do have a lot with bachelor's
35:49 - degrees
35:49 - and master's degrees but again it's
35:51 - really quickly switching up
35:52 - to where you don't actually need one as
35:54 - as google says you don't need it as
35:56 - facebook as
35:57 - you need it and so forth all right ai
36:00 - ai field guys a lot of you guys are
36:03 - excited for a data scientist
36:05 - field let us know in the comments below
36:08 - if that's something that
36:09 - you're into and before we go go please
36:12 - go ahead and smash that like button
36:14 - and hit the subscribe button for more
36:17 - videos
36:18 - like this guys but smash the like button
36:20 - let's go ahead and get this up how many
36:21 - likes do we have
36:22 - 207 let's get this up to 500 guys i know
36:25 - you guys can i know we can
36:26 - i know we can so run us through the
36:29 - timeline here
36:30 - logan yeah for sure so
36:33 - ai kind of started even towards the
36:36 - beginning of uh computing so this is
36:38 - kind of like post world war two in the
36:39 - 1950s so you'll see i want to point out
36:41 - in 1964
36:43 - eliza was the first chat developed
36:46 - and it was developed at mit that was in
36:48 - 1964 guys wow that's beautiful that is
36:50 - insane
36:52 - that's before even c was created so
36:55 - that's
36:56 - like they're working with stuff like
36:57 - fortran you know things that most people
36:58 - never heard of but it's ancient
37:00 - moving forward um a lot of stuff didn't
37:02 - really happen with ai from about like
37:04 - the 70s into the 90s i think that
37:06 - had a lot to do with kind of the
37:07 - limitations of hardware at the time
37:09 - but moving forward into kind of like the
37:11 - late 90s the 2000s and definitely the
37:13 - 2010s ai
37:15 - kind of takes off as hardware
37:16 - accelerated so it looks like in 1997 we
37:19 - have deep blue so we have a chess
37:20 - playing computer that
37:22 - beat uh uh from i think is that ibm yes
37:26 - ibm and it defeats the world chess
37:27 - champion so in 1997 ai
37:29 - trump's the best chess player in the
37:30 - world oh definitely i think i think kazi
37:32 - will definitely like this one
37:33 - for sure oh i'm sure he'll love it it'll
37:36 - you know
37:38 - uh so moving into 2002 you guys see
37:41 - roomba so i'm sure you know about kind
37:42 - of like the
37:44 - robots that you vacuum your house roomba
37:46 - was in 2002 and so that was an
37:47 - artificial intelligence that kind of
37:49 - tracks like that
37:50 - the the geospatial map of your living
37:53 - room and will vacuum the house moving
37:54 - into 2011 so a big 10-year jump roughly
37:57 - siri and the iphone in 2007 we have 2011
38:01 - sorry we have watson for ibm
38:03 - another question answering ai we have
38:05 - eugene
38:06 - which is another chat bot and we have
38:08 - alexa in 2014 with amazon
38:10 - and then moving forward before behavi
38:12 - which is now microsoft's ai that you can
38:14 - talk to and in 2017 we have alphago
38:16 - which is uh google's
38:18 - um it's their ai that they use to beat
38:20 - the best go player in the world
38:21 - yeah nice nice nice so you can see as we
38:24 - go on right
38:25 - a lot a lot we are getting a lot more
38:27 - complex and we are getting a lot more
38:29 - smarter with
38:30 - this right between alexa like i'm sure
38:32 - you guys a lot of you guys probably have
38:33 - alexa
38:34 - in your home and i know it's so useful
38:37 - um you know and you know imagine you
38:38 - know
38:39 - really in the future just kind of being
38:40 - like oh alexa you know uh alexa you know
38:43 - uh you know take me to
38:46 - the moon i don't know but
38:49 - i mean i want my ai to like start the
38:51 - car for me the morning so it's warm in
38:52 - the canadian winter man that'd be great
38:55 - yeah that'd be funny that'd be funny i
38:56 - agree all right let's continue on so
38:58 - where to learn let's go ahead
39:00 - some responsibilities or some
39:01 - requirements right qualifications for
39:04 - for the specific i'm not going to be
39:05 - touched too much guys
39:07 - but with ai obviously right python is
39:10 - going to be a big one
39:11 - so let me go ahead and just kind of drop
39:12 - that down here right in terms of text
39:14 - right
39:14 - so you go ahead logan tell me kind of
39:16 - what is a big one right for example
39:18 - i would say python
39:22 - right language we're looking at python
39:24 - for machine learning especially
39:26 - we're going to be looking at kind of
39:27 - like web frameworks like
39:29 - uh django is somewhat relevant here but
39:31 - definitely things like tensorflow
39:33 - um tensorflow yes um
39:37 - moving into artificial intelligence
39:38 - that's not on the web but maybe
39:40 - more for embedded systems like
39:43 - self-driving cars
39:44 - or autopilot and aircraft so aircraft
39:47 - simulation stuff like that
39:48 - um we're gonna be looking at lower level
39:50 - languages so you might be looking at c
39:51 - c plus plus c plus plus okay then
39:55 - obviously you're looking at for example
39:56 - like python
39:58 - right you're looking for example like um
40:00 - for this one like
40:01 - matlab and by entrance or no matlab
40:04 - yeah that'll be relevant for sure
40:07 - i want it i want to just tie in guys
40:09 - here that data science is 100 relevant
40:11 - to artificial intelligence
40:13 - usually data science works with a
40:14 - smaller subset of ai
40:16 - right where we're looking at like
40:17 - natural language processing we're
40:19 - looking at machine learning
40:20 - but i mean these are all ai concepts
40:22 - this all kind of lives within the realm
40:23 - of ai so i want you to think data
40:25 - scientists live within artificial
40:26 - intelligence
40:27 - exactly exactly okay sweet sweet and
40:29 - then those are the pretty much
40:30 - right those are the very big core
40:33 - pillars and then i would say that's like
40:34 - the r language right
40:35 - is it the r language as well yes yes are
40:38 - very very popular
40:40 - data science language uh really powerful
40:41 - for working with large data frames um
40:43 - doing calculations data cleanup and the
40:45 - rest
40:46 - exactly sweet okay beautiful so
40:49 - let's continue on so that is some things
40:51 - you guys need to know suk
40:52 - hi everybody says hi nas
40:57 - umar hello what is up what is up so good
40:59 - to see you all like always
41:00 - all right some examples we took from
41:03 - online right
41:04 - tesla here for example south engineering
41:05 - computer vision ai
41:07 - right um in ai what are some some of the
41:10 - requirements they're looking into this
41:11 - is actually this is literally
41:12 - we took that just now like really a few
41:14 - minutes ago so
41:16 - they want yes they say computer science
41:18 - degree but check this out
41:19 - a proof of exceptional skills in related
41:22 - fields with practical software
41:24 - engineering
41:24 - experience okay right practical
41:28 - is the key practical
41:31 - okay so also with that a minimum of
41:34 - three years of experience with
41:35 - production level c sub spa so for
41:37 - example logan talked about right c
41:39 - c plus plus um right and j and generic
41:42 - programming and
41:43 - are highly as uh we're desirable we talk
41:46 - about matlab look at this python numpy
41:48 - c plus plus all those things are going
41:50 - to be a very big key players
41:52 - and here for example this is elon musk
41:54 - talking about how
41:56 - all right all that matters is deep
41:58 - understanding of ai
41:59 - and ability to implement neural networks
42:02 - if that's what nns stands for guys okay
42:04 - neural networks in a way that is
42:06 - actually useful
42:08 - don't care hold on check this out don't
42:10 - care if you
42:11 - ever even graduated high school
42:16 - high school guys they're like ah
42:19 - you don't need to high school you're
42:20 - fine
42:22 - just knock on his front door man it's
42:24 - like hey i dropped out 10th grade but
42:26 - hell i can like make a self-driving car
42:28 - super easily oh man
42:31 - oh man all right let's keep going guys
42:32 - okay that's an interesting slide
42:36 - yeah yeah that was a funny jib that's an
42:39 - interesting slide one okay
42:42 - what are you trying to say here what are
42:43 - you trying to say here logan huh logan
42:45 - what are you trying to tell us
42:47 - ai is going to take over the world no
42:48 - guys but for real uh the most powerful
42:50 - superhero
42:51 - computer in the world take over the
42:53 - world not we don't want that none yeah
42:54 - or am i never
42:55 - the most powerful super computer in the
42:56 - world it's about as intelligent as a
42:58 - cockroach all things considered so we're
43:00 - at no risk of
43:01 - what people talk about when they're in
43:02 - fear of ai taking over the world
43:04 - is if the machines can learn faster than
43:07 - the humans can learn
43:08 - then they can outpace us and then we
43:10 - have a problem yeah so we're still
43:12 - pretty smart guys we're still pretty
43:13 - smart human beings okay
43:14 - they will come get to a point where
43:16 - maybe we not you know there'll be
43:17 - smarter things but we're still pretty
43:18 - smart
43:21 - alrighty so next up computer security
43:23 - guys who know what's good
43:24 - somebody says skynet yeah computer
43:26 - security guys so let's go ahead and talk
43:28 - a little bit about that computer
43:29 - security it's another different field
43:31 - in software development right we talked
43:33 - about right that is
43:34 - why we do not get hacked all the time
43:37 - right
43:38 - a lot of our computers have a anti-virus
43:40 - right installed
43:41 - so that is where you have for example
43:42 - malware right phishing
43:44 - password attacks so trying to protect
43:46 - against those
43:47 - and a lot of companies for a lot of
43:49 - companies like for example
43:51 - right bank companies or credit card
43:53 - companies they're gonna hire a lot for
43:55 - computer
43:56 - security so guys if you're that's
43:58 - something that maybe might interest you
44:00 - or if you are computer
44:01 - in computer security let us know down in
44:03 - the comments really i'm really curious
44:05 - right but that's going to be one of the
44:06 - things that you know uh
44:08 - when the jobs are also very popular and
44:11 - is going to be getting more popular
44:14 - through time
44:15 - as well okay and just some requirements
44:19 - can we talk about some of the quick
44:20 - requirements really quickly here
44:22 - uh yes for sure um so
44:25 - just as a disclaimer guys computer
44:26 - security is kind of being on like the
44:28 - edge i would say
44:29 - of maybe what you're used to with
44:31 - software engineering and
44:32 - computer science it's starting to get
44:34 - into the realm of networking
44:36 - transferring data over the internet it's
44:38 - also going to be within the realm of
44:39 - kind of
44:41 - understanding um like protocols and
44:43 - working with lower level languages
44:44 - however
44:44 - what you can expect to have as
44:47 - background knowledge coming into it
44:49 - is an understanding of i.t maybe a bit
44:51 - of operating systems understanding of
44:53 - the different kinds of attacks that you
44:55 - can do
44:55 - on machines so those are listed here one
44:59 - through six we have
45:00 - malware there's stuff like
45:03 - regularly computer security people are
45:05 - doing what's called penetration testing
45:06 - to see if they can break through systems
45:08 - and kind of like
45:09 - impersonate data that should otherwise
45:10 - be correct
45:12 - penetration testing what is that
45:15 - uh i can't say i know 100 but my
45:17 - understanding is penetration testing is
45:19 - essentially you have a system
45:20 - it's think of it as a wall and so that
45:22 - wall is to represent security and your
45:24 - job is to kind of like hit it with
45:25 - different kinds of attacks or different
45:27 - kinds of like
45:27 - data ways two ways to kind of like break
45:30 - that wall and so the idea is you want to
45:32 - break the wall and you want to see how
45:33 - you did it
45:34 - break the wall so see if you can break
45:36 - the wall basically
45:38 - essentially if you can bet get past the
45:39 - security okay can you get and actually a
45:41 - lot of companies actually pay a lot of
45:43 - money for that
45:44 - can you get past the security so for
45:46 - example i know apple
45:47 - as an example will pay you i think
45:49 - thousands of dollars if you can actually
45:51 - find
45:51 - you know find a security loophole in
45:53 - their system right
45:56 - go ahead bug bounties so if you google
45:58 - bug bounties here you'll see
46:00 - how much money companies are putting up
46:01 - tens of thousands of dollars to see if
46:03 - you can find major flaws
46:05 - really wait bug bounties yes
46:09 - google bug bounties hold on let me see
46:10 - bug bounty
46:12 - bounty i'm actually very curious how
46:14 - much is that bug bounty list
46:17 - i'm never actually looking at this kind
46:19 - of stuff guys
46:21 - there's entire communities of what's
46:23 - called white hat hackers these are
46:25 - people who hack
46:26 - professionally but do so in a way where
46:27 - they were when
46:31 - i don't hear you logan logan you're
46:33 - looks like you muted
46:35 - hello
46:39 - you're muted logan that's fine
46:43 - can you get that let me see can i hear
46:45 - you talk
46:46 - hello hello talk i don't hear you i
46:48 - don't hear you
46:51 - hello hello hello hello hello that's
46:52 - okay so yeah go ahead and try and fix
46:55 - that if you can if you can it will keep
46:56 - going
46:57 - so bug bounty as you can see let me see
46:59 - what are some great examples of bug
47:00 - bounties
47:03 - bug bounty bug bounty
47:08 - just i don't know we're just looking
47:09 - it's gone guys guys let's all hype up
47:11 - this round to bring logan back let's go
47:18 - go ahead guys yeah logan try to rejoin
47:20 - if you can if you can that's completely
47:22 - fine but try it one more time guys but
47:23 - let's
47:24 - bring up logan back into this chat but
47:26 - while
47:27 - logan is trying to figure out his stuff
47:28 - we're going to continue on um
47:30 - right and do our stuff so bug bounty bug
47:33 - bounty examples
47:35 - i'm very curious because i haven't
47:37 - looked back bunny examples
47:42 - wow how i hacked facebook and received
47:44 - 34
47:45 - wow how i hacked facebook and received
47:47 - 3500 bug
47:49 - bounty insane i was actually working
47:51 - funny flaws
47:52 - on dropbox to begin and i noticed when
47:54 - using their web interface there was some
47:56 - restrictions on what
47:57 - file names that were allowed if you try
47:59 - to rename a file name for example
48:01 - to this okay it was not possible you get
48:05 - this error but if you instead connect a
48:07 - local directory
48:08 - create a file there and sync it you get
48:10 - you you
48:11 - got it inside dropbox without any
48:13 - problems holy moly no way
48:16 - i select the file and i synced to
48:18 - dropbox and it was called blah blah blah
48:19 - and shared it
48:20 - nothing awesome happened except the file
48:22 - be being shared but then i clicked the
48:24 - share link
48:25 - in the entry bam the title of the entry
48:29 - was not escaped correctly and i was able
48:30 - to get the stored
48:32 - xss triggered i'm not sure what that
48:34 - means but using the
48:35 - the files in my dropbox i could inject
48:37 - script code that was
48:39 - no way so basically guys what he was
48:41 - able to do is he was able to inject
48:43 - script code you with the files that he
48:46 - uploaded to facebook
48:48 - that is insane so that i mean no this is
48:50 - not you know i'm not saying go do this
48:52 - this is not good guys i'm not
48:52 - encouraging you guys to go out and hack
48:54 - but this is you can find flaws in
48:57 - different systems right
48:59 - that is really cool part about this all
49:00 - right let's go ahead and keep going let
49:02 - me see if we can still
49:03 - get logan back on here maybe maybe not
49:06 - we'll see if not okay
49:07 - all right let's keep going here all
49:09 - right so
49:10 - for that here are some examples that we
49:12 - found in specific
49:14 - in this specific all right let's go
49:16 - ahead
49:17 - right here so cyber security analyst
49:20 - that is an example from microsoft
49:23 - and if you oh let's go ahead if you look
49:26 - at the qualifications that microsoft
49:29 - looks for so two plus years of hands-on
49:31 - experience in either security operations
49:34 - threat detection analysis incident
49:36 - response and secure
49:37 - network design so again they're not
49:40 - looking so much
49:41 - for not looking so much for
49:44 - um you know uh computer science degree
49:46 - they're looking so much
49:47 - more for experience logan if you are
49:49 - trying to to get in touch
49:51 - go ahead and call me because i cannot
49:53 - for some reason call you right now
49:55 - all right so go ahead and call me and
49:56 - i'll just pick up yep let's hack nasa
49:58 - let's not
50:00 - let's not hack anybody that's not what
50:01 - we're trying to do embedded systems guys
50:04 - another field a potential feel for
50:07 - developers okay potential feel for
50:09 - developers
50:10 - so embedded systems are our systems that
50:14 - do not run operating systems okay
50:17 - so for example like let's say you have a
50:19 - watch right so
50:20 - let's say you have a watch right here
50:23 - you have a watch
50:23 - and it's a casio watch that just simply
50:25 - shows you time that isn't a better
50:27 - system okay
50:28 - um for example a car and i'll show you
50:30 - an example right here a car
50:32 - logan's calling me now let's see logan
50:34 - can i get you on here
50:38 - why is it let me see them cmc come on
50:40 - man my skype is like frozen dead
50:44 - nice club is just frozen that doesn't
50:46 - huh
50:50 - skype force quit quit skype
50:54 - that's not screen skype man
50:57 - all right first quick oh never mind
51:00 - it quit skype yeah let's go i quit skype
51:03 - all right good good good good
51:04 - all right so then i gotta bring that
51:05 - skype back up
51:11 - i am back up on skype let's see logan
51:14 - i'm calling you logan
51:19 - all right i got you so while i'm trying
51:21 - to get ahold of logan let's see if
51:23 - we can oh is logan on here logan on here
51:26 - connecting looks like it's connecting
51:28 - guys it's connecting connecting
51:29 - connecting connecting
51:32 - let's go guys give us a fire for
51:34 - location
51:38 - hear me yeah we can hear you hey logan
51:40 - what's up wait but we can't see you just
51:42 - yet
51:42 - that's weird because my camera's on um
51:44 - i'm going to try and fix this
51:46 - all right try to fix it if you can't
51:48 - it's fine
51:51 - no we still can't hear you logan all
51:53 - right i'm gonna continue on
51:54 - with the presentation so embedded system
51:57 - right that is gonna include for example
51:59 - including you know
52:00 - uh building up your raspberry pi is
52:02 - building up your the systems through
52:03 - their arduino
52:05 - right so for example when you want to
52:06 - when you build digital cameras that's an
52:08 - abandoned system when you build dvd
52:09 - player that's in a bad system
52:11 - right any appliance in your home that's
52:12 - independent system
52:14 - gaming consoles setup boxes wireless
52:16 - routers doors are embedded systems
52:18 - and for example in a car and a car is an
52:21 - example here
52:22 - okay you know everything inside the car
52:25 - for example airbag system the powertrain
52:28 - right
52:29 - for example when you go ahead and put
52:31 - the foot down right and it needs to know
52:33 - how much exactly it needs to accelerate
52:36 - that is part of an
52:37 - embedded system okay all right let's
52:40 - continue on and here's some things you
52:41 - need to know for embedded systems if you
52:43 - want to go into that
52:44 - field you have for example c plus plus
52:46 - javascript
52:47 - python oh let me show you make sure i'm
52:49 - showing you c plus plus javascript
52:51 - python you know java and so forth i'm
52:53 - not sure if you guys seen this but
52:54 - here's the airbag system that was
52:56 - talking about the you know the embedded
52:57 - system for uh for cars
53:00 - all right so that is something that you
53:02 - would be looking into
53:04 - you know a building building with for
53:06 - example using it if you
53:08 - like adrenal boards right and if you're
53:09 - into that you will be building it
53:11 - through that
53:12 - let me know down in the comments guys if
53:13 - that's something that interests you
53:15 - for me personally physical things for
53:17 - some reason don't interest me as
53:19 - much i don't know why i'm not a big fan
53:22 - of those
53:23 - um let me see it's quit skype is
53:26 - just can you see me now or can you hear
53:28 - me nah i can hear you but i can't see
53:29 - you though
53:30 - oh weird i just unplugged my camera and
53:32 - replugged it in to make it work but and
53:34 - i can see myself in skype so it's weird
53:35 - that it's yeah
53:36 - i don't see on skype i didn't see
53:37 - unscripted it's all right we'll have
53:38 - we'll have logan as a
53:40 - as a voice as an extra voice guys okay
53:43 - can you screen share and skype notes
53:44 - oh yeah let me see maybe
53:49 - where is skype
53:53 - i can't screen share because it just
53:54 - says connecting
53:57 - all right logan you're just going to be
53:58 - with us here so as an example of the
54:01 - nevada system
54:02 - tesla for a tesla went ahead and
54:04 - uploaded
54:05 - their their um their job posting and by
54:08 - the south engineering
54:10 - for gateway you know where you are going
54:11 - to be delivering high quality c code in
54:13 - real time embedded environment
54:15 - so for example for in terms of cars you
54:18 - you might be working on things like
54:20 - you know um you know engine control
54:24 - right maybe brake control
54:28 - right and so forth right so it's the
54:29 - communication behind the brakes the
54:32 - you know uh be behind behind basically
54:35 - between the brakes between
54:37 - you using the gas pedal and all of that
54:40 - that is what embedded systems as a
54:42 - better system you're going to be working
54:44 - on
54:44 - all right experience requirements here
54:47 - check this out
54:47 - experience and abundance development in
54:49 - robotics real-time controls or system
54:51 - software so basically again they're not
54:54 - looking
54:55 - for a degree right so he's very
54:56 - particular about that
54:58 - and fluid and stuff fundamentals
54:59 - including software design and
55:00 - maintainability
55:02 - so here's an example now let's get into
55:04 - devops a really good one
55:06 - devops i personally love devops guys
55:09 - um it's not something i'm i'm good at
55:11 - something i really want to get
55:13 - much much better at but let me go ahead
55:15 - and put skype just so
55:16 - cuz like it looks like it's just not
55:17 - working um so devlops is the whole
55:21 - process right it is the whole process
55:23 - behind
55:24 - right behind application
55:27 - development okay so an example right the
55:30 - whole process application development
55:31 - includes planning
55:33 - building continuous integration
55:35 - deploying so the canadian integration
55:37 - is when you um basically go ahead and
55:40 - test
55:40 - you have ci that test your app right so
55:43 - it tests your app
55:44 - and then it goes ahead and actually
55:48 - and then it deploys the app right so
55:50 - that is continuous integration
55:52 - okay so with ci for example you think
55:55 - it's like jenkins and june and so forth
55:57 - they deploy your app down to like docker
55:59 - or to
56:00 - amazon for example and ec2 instance or
56:03 - maybe it's to firebase who knows
56:05 - okay then you operate it right right
56:08 - wait operation
56:09 - is when you go ahead and actually uh
56:11 - let's see operation
56:13 - through jira it is when you go ahead and
56:15 - plan
56:16 - things out through jio that is planning
56:19 - right
56:20 - continuous feedback that's when you get
56:21 - feedback about your application and then
56:23 - you continue on so plan build ti deploy
56:25 - opera and so forth right and that my
56:27 - friends is an embedded
56:29 - system so you'll get to work on things
56:31 - like docker like
56:32 - right kubernetes uh eclipse right and so
56:35 - forth not eclipse the eclipse is
56:36 - is is not that in an id don't worry
56:39 - about that
56:40 - amazon s3 amazon ec2 instances right
56:43 - that's when you can architect
56:46 - how the whole system works
56:50 - you see that that is where that comes in
56:53 - so here's an example side availability
56:54 - engineer at
56:55 - uh at apple uh right here in san diego
56:58 - california right they're looking for
57:00 - three plus years of managing site
57:01 - reliability engineer
57:03 - teams and supporting mission critical
57:04 - applications five plus years of
57:07 - experience there um three per year plus
57:09 - years of hybrid cloud so
57:10 - being able to go through aws azure is
57:13 - gonna be really big part so
57:14 - aws is something that uh we will cover
57:17 - as well at some point too
57:19 - right being able to understand nosql
57:21 - databases right
57:22 - and releasing databases as well very big
57:25 - part ci
57:26 - right ci continuous integration
57:27 - pipelines right here so
57:30 - again these are for me personally i love
57:33 - these roles and it's something
57:34 - that i haven't worked on but i've worked
57:36 - on you know as a developer i've worked
57:38 - on
57:38 - continuous integration i've worked on
57:40 - aws and so forth
57:43 - so guys who hear the comments
57:46 - logan is like skype servers are dying
57:47 - here guys sorry my internet is fine
57:50 - yeah skype come on we had facebook who's
57:52 - trying to take us down now we have skype
57:54 - who's trying to take us down what is
57:56 - wrong with this
57:57 - week huh wait frankie's not here i
58:00 - thought frankie was here guys but he's
58:01 - not here anyways
58:02 - let's eat some food all right
58:05 - so all right
58:09 - we are finishing up here almost done and
58:12 - then
58:12 - we gotta take questions okay guys
58:17 - next up databases sorry one second
58:20 - gotta need some water
58:26 - my water is good guys that was so good
58:29 - hey
58:30 - so databases right you've got your
58:32 - sequel you got your non-sequel so sequel
58:34 - database are relational databases
58:36 - nosql are not relational databases
58:39 - okay and you can actually have a job in
58:41 - database management
58:42 - and so forth so but you'll know for
58:44 - example you'll have to learn things like
58:46 - postgresql mysql amazon history amazon
58:48 - amazon microsoft azure firebase right
58:52 - mongodb those are going to be your key
58:54 - players okay
58:55 - and here's some examples from td
58:57 - ameritrade in terms of
58:58 - right database administrator so dba
59:01 - stands for database
59:02 - administrator okay they're looking for
59:04 - minimum one year
59:05 - database administration working
59:06 - experience building and deploying
59:09 - administrative distributed oracle
59:11 - databases so
59:12 - with this type of work it's actually
59:14 - pretty fun it's you being able to
59:17 - go ahead and create database schema so
59:19 - here's an example what i mean by that
59:20 - here's database schema
59:25 - data base schema
59:33 - database schema uh let's go ahead
59:35 - database schema
59:39 - er there we go here's database schema
59:41 - here's an example
59:43 - so for example you will be building a
59:45 - schema like this this is a
59:47 - relational database schema i know it
59:49 - looks scary but
59:50 - don't get scared very important guys
59:52 - okay
59:54 - would you mainly as as a database
59:57 - administrator what you will under
59:58 - have to understand is okay how from the
60:01 - top level view
60:02 - what data does our application need
60:06 - right what can we do with that data and
60:08 - how do we go ahead
60:10 - and save the data in a database so that
60:12 - it is also
60:13 - very scalable right so it's one thing to
60:16 - have a database with 10 rows
60:18 - or 10 rows saved it's another thing to
60:21 - have database saved with
60:22 - millions of rows and i've worked with
60:24 - both with smaller databases and
60:27 - large databases right so
60:30 - that is going to be and you have to
60:31 - think about okay well you know think
60:32 - about for here's an example
60:36 - can you take a quick video from me
60:37 - frankie thank you
60:40 - so let me sew i'm just trying i want to
60:44 - introduce you guys as much as possible
60:45 - in terms of what i know so you can see
60:47 - here as an example let's say you have a
60:53 - let's say you have a database schema
60:54 - looks like this and i start out with
60:56 - a user right here right a user has user
60:59 - password username user email right and
61:01 - so forth right
61:02 - and the user now has for example let me
61:05 - look at this
61:06 - uh comment so let's say now a user has
61:08 - comments right here okay
61:10 - and so now you have a separate table for
61:13 - comments as well which is right here
61:15 - and that has a comment id and user id
61:16 - user type you comment text
61:18 - and so forth right so again right
61:22 - then from comments let's say you also
61:23 - have let me see
61:25 - uh assignment so user might have an
61:27 - assignment right
61:28 - and that has a user a assignment id
61:31 - right
61:31 - you know is it reviewed you know the
61:33 - user id and assignment in the initial
61:36 - as well and so you have to be the person
61:38 - to actually understand
61:40 - what data and how am i going to save
61:41 - this data properly in the database
61:45 - personally it's actually something
61:46 - really fun and that's something you're
61:47 - interested in actually doing
61:49 - let me know down in the comments right
61:50 - let me know down in the comments if
61:51 - there's something you want to learn
61:53 - how to for example build a database
61:55 - schema how to build
61:56 - we call them er models okay
62:00 - let me know down in the comments and uh
62:02 - that's something that that we're looking
62:03 - into
62:04 - actually uh providing that kind of
62:06 - content to you guys
62:07 - right here on this amazing youtube
62:09 - channel
62:10 - alrighty sweet let's keep going let's
62:12 - keep going let's go ahead and exit this
62:14 - out
62:14 - next up so this is to me to the
62:16 - ameritrade right uh
62:18 - example here next up so i know this is
62:21 - guys this is way too much
62:22 - this is a lot a lot has been just given
62:25 - to you
62:26 - okay let me know in the comments if
62:28 - you're a little bit like
62:29 - holy moly what is going on how do i go
62:32 - from there
62:35 - so call degree
62:39 - no degree that
62:43 - is the question okay degree or no degree
62:47 - from what we have learned from what we
62:49 - have learned both
62:51 - are going to require a lot of studying
62:54 - both
62:54 - are going to require a lot of work you
62:57 - can see we just have frankie in the back
62:59 - hi frankie
63:00 - both are going to require a lot of work
63:04 - right degrees are something required in
63:07 - the corporate more traditional world
63:09 - but the world is changing guys the world
63:11 - is changing really quickly
63:12 - right 40 degrees are expensive between
63:14 - 40 dollars to two hundred twenty
63:16 - thousand dollars depending on the
63:17 - tuition cost
63:18 - right but now with self taught with
63:21 - right with
63:22 - with codecademy with youtube resources
63:25 - like
63:25 - this that you have here on youtube right
63:28 - with profit javascript course which by
63:31 - the way we're going to launch
63:32 - this sunday people are starting to
63:35 - realize you don't actually need that you
63:36 - simply just need the experience and you
63:37 - simply just need
63:38 - the projects and you simply just need
63:41 - right hands on
63:42 - experience that you that's the most
63:44 - important part
63:46 - and so if you're someone who wants to be
63:47 - their own boss a college degree may not
63:49 - be necessary for you
63:50 - self-talk can be a fraction of the cost
63:53 - less than a thousand dollars and you can
63:54 - start making your own income
63:56 - so let me know down in the comments
63:59 - all right let me know down in the
64:00 - comments if no you still think a degree
64:02 - is going to be for you
64:03 - personally for me here's one one big
64:06 - thing oh dania i keep doing this
64:07 - command done file every open close tab
64:12 - one big thing that i want to talk about
64:14 - guys is
64:17 - here's here's a big here's a big issue
64:20 - here's a big issue what i will say
64:23 - is as someone who is self-taught so
64:26 - as self-taught okay
64:32 - which you here let me put this again
64:34 - self-taught
64:36 - right taut one big thing you need to
64:40 - understand
64:41 - is the fact that you need to be if you
64:44 - want to be self-taught and not go
64:46 - a degree route you need to be
64:47 - disciplined
64:50 - right you need to be hard worker
64:55 - obviously that's going to be for any
64:56 - case and being able to push yourself
65:00 - non-stop
65:03 - have passion
65:08 - the reason why i say for this for self
65:10 - taught
65:11 - is because the discipline is going to be
65:14 - the hardest part
65:15 - right as a self-taught developer you
65:17 - have to be the one to
65:19 - push yourself to do those projects you
65:21 - have to be the one
65:23 - to actually write right to create
65:26 - opportunities for you
65:27 - versus for example if you're going to go
65:29 - to the degree route
65:30 - right a lot a lot you know as it will be
65:34 - provided for you right so
65:35 - project will be
65:38 - provided right
65:42 - you still need to still hard work
65:44 - required right
65:46 - all that's required of course and you
65:48 - still need to push yourself in any case
65:49 - you still need to push yourself
65:53 - but that's the big key thing that i've
65:55 - seen between self-taught
65:57 - and you know when you have a degree okay
66:00 - you're self-taught you have to be
66:01 - extremely disciplined so if you're
66:02 - watching these videos guys
66:04 - and if you're doing the clones with us
66:05 - if you are if you go ahead and you're
66:07 - building these projects
66:08 - it is extremely important that you know
66:11 - you build the projects yourself
66:12 - to don't just watch but actually build
66:15 - them to complete
66:16 - complete entirety okay and then make
66:19 - sure to share with us as well
66:20 - right so that's going to be the big part
66:22 - that i want to just want to touch on
66:24 - okay
66:24 - and also obviously of course make sure
66:27 - to share this says
66:28 - you know tag me logan right here you

67:16 - without a degree you can be a freelance
67:19 - web developer
67:20 - something you can achieve from being
67:21 - self-taught the main problem is getting
67:23 - first-time clients
67:24 - how do you have any advice on solving
67:27 - that issue
67:29 - let me see where is that one how do you
67:31 - advise there we go
67:34 - let me see i got it i got it boom
67:38 - all right so
67:45 - without a degree without degree
67:46 - freelancer developer something you can
67:48 - achieve by being self-taught
67:49 - the main problem is getting first-time
67:51 - clients how do you advise and solving
67:52 - this issue
67:53 - so yes you are right getting your first
67:55 - client is going to be the hardest
67:57 - thing out there okay that is going to be
68:00 - your breaking point
68:02 - to solve this issue to solve this issue
68:04 - it's it's
68:05 - it's not going to be simple it's just
68:06 - you're going to have to keep it and keep
68:08 - doing and doing until you get that first
68:10 - client now
68:12 - one way to help you out with that
68:16 - is actually to go ahead and get a client
68:20 - to try to get your first client
68:22 - through people you might know so i
68:24 - always say for example when you're
68:26 - starting out in freelancing okay
68:28 - i always say guys you know call
68:31 - anybody you know and ask them if they're
68:34 - looking to
68:35 - get any job done or they know anybody
68:37 - who needs to get the
68:38 - job done you know who needs freelance
68:40 - work
68:42 - call them up here's why because in
68:44 - freelancing
68:45 - trust is the most important thing that's
68:47 - the one thing i've realized in
68:48 - freelancing i've done freelancing for
68:50 - about a year
68:51 - right about a year until i you know kind
68:53 - of started started coaching you guys and
68:54 - started
68:55 - you know doing my profit with javascript
68:57 - you know and teaching about development
69:00 - right and gain the first client was the
69:02 - hardest but
69:03 - i actually partnered up with a friend of
69:04 - mine and we went ahead what we literally
69:07 - did
69:08 - is we we had someone who gave
69:12 - us work and because we had the trust
69:15 - with them and that was our first client
69:17 - and once we got to the first content
69:19 - again the second one of them was a lot a
69:21 - lot
69:21 - easier okay so that is how i would say
69:25 - how to you know unsolve that issue
69:27 - another way you can solve this issue as
69:28 - well and just gonna as i'm talking
69:30 - through here
69:31 - another way to solve this issue is right
69:33 - you know we talk we what do we touch on
69:35 - we touched on
69:36 - right you know um talk to people you
69:39 - know
69:39 - gawk to talk to people you know
69:44 - you know but also don't forget
69:48 - very important is right just keep going
69:52 - like just keep going
69:57 - keep going don't stop at just one
70:00 - proposal
70:00 - right you sometimes you have to uh
70:02 - submit you know 100
70:04 - to 150 to 200 proposals to actually get
70:06 - that first client
70:07 - and then what you'll start to see you
70:08 - know for example maybe one way to get
70:10 - your first client
70:11 - is also lower your price i know it's a
70:15 - hard thing to do guys because we don't
70:16 - want to price ourselves really low at
70:18 - all but
70:20 - if you're charging you know if nobody
70:21 - really knows who you are and you're
70:22 - charging a hundred dollars an hour
70:24 - that's gonna be pretty hard to get that
70:26 - for example a network or freelancing
70:28 - okay or freelancer versus if you were to
70:32 - charge like 15 initially
70:33 - for example when i was starting out i
70:35 - told you know i was told and that's what
70:37 - i did it was to start out with 15 for
70:39 - example
70:40 - an hour so like for example at 15 per
70:42 - hour
70:43 - and then i moved up from 15 to 25 to 40
70:45 - to 50 and
70:46 - so forth okay but we started with
70:50 - 15 pretty much 15 an hour
70:53 - and when you get to download and you
70:55 - know getting that first kind is a lot
70:56 - easier because you're not just the
70:57 - person who's like
70:58 - you know i'll do the work and then
71:01 - actually i
71:01 - was one client for me where i was like
71:03 - you know i'll do free for free
71:05 - because i really need that first
71:07 - experience yeah
71:09 - so that was that was very interesting
71:11 - don't do you know yeah
71:12 - do it for free is is is good okay but if
71:14 - you can charge for example a lower price
71:15 - like 15 an hour
71:16 - and so forth that's gonna be good too um
71:21 - what is the least this least price let
71:23 - me go ahead let me look another one
71:24 - what is the least price you should
71:26 - charge for a contract job like i said
71:29 - guys it really depends
71:30 - um on who you are and what you do
71:33 - let me see let me go ahead
71:37 - what is the lease for is it what is
71:41 - oh my god a show to you here
71:45 - all right what's the least price you
71:47 - should charge for a contract job
71:49 - depends on where you are and depends uh
71:51 - depends on where you are if you're in
71:52 - usa for example and you just starting
71:54 - out 15 an hour is
71:55 - is a good way to go 15 an hour then you
71:57 - can move up from there to 20 25 and so
71:59 - forth
72:00 - if you are somewhere outside you know
72:02 - you might be looking potentially some
72:03 - something somewhere lower
72:05 - right depends on the location but
72:08 - it also honestly you know do not
72:10 - underprice yourself as well
72:12 - because some people you might not know
72:14 - where your location is if you have for
72:15 - example client
72:16 - usa right you might be able to charge
72:19 - higher
72:20 - so it's really hard for me to just tell
72:21 - you an exact number you have to really
72:22 - play around with it
72:24 - but if you're for example when you say
72:25 - you want to start you know you try it
72:26 - out try the 15 and see
72:28 - what works out if 15 is a bit if the bit
72:32 - if the 15 is a bit bit too much because
72:35 - for example you see
72:36 - yourself you're not getting you know
72:37 - enough clients or you can't get one
72:39 - client at least then lower your price
72:40 - it's as simple as that
72:42 - all right but once you've got the first
72:44 - client for that price very important
72:46 - guys very important here
72:47 - once you've got the client for that
72:49 - price increase your price
72:54 - increase your price every single project
72:55 - you do and keep increasing your price
72:57 - very important guys all right next up
73:00 - another question one other question well
73:03 - let's go with to kill
73:07 - all right pedro asks pedro asked let me
73:10 - see
73:14 - oh god it's so hard to
73:19 - no pedro
73:22 - asks
73:25 - boom right there badger asks what's a
73:29 - good way to kill the coding challenge
73:31 - just when it's extremely new to coding i
73:33 - can write code and look i'm looking
73:34 - things up
73:35 - but i can't sit there and do them so
73:37 - pedro if you're in that specific
73:40 - you know you just simply need to put in
73:42 - more time into it
73:43 - right so you need to build the projects
73:46 - themselves so yes you can look up things
73:48 - and so forth
73:49 - but you need to understand what make for
73:52 - you
73:52 - what's fun like why is coding fun
73:56 - why is coding fun for you right
74:00 - because the other day that is the very
74:02 - important that's that's the key
74:04 - if it's fun for you right and you enjoy
74:07 - it you're going to keep doing it and
74:08 - then you're going to get results
74:10 - now if you enjoy it and you get results
74:13 - man
74:13 - you're you're on another level you know
74:16 - but

81:09 - fan of full stack development i am a
81:12 - full stack developer
81:13 - guys and what i can tell from experience
81:16 - is a full
81:16 - developer you have a ton more you not
81:19 - only do you have a ton more confidence
81:20 - but you also have a ton more
81:21 - opportunities
81:22 - why because you can apply for front-end
81:24 - jobs you can apply for back-end jobs
81:26 - and you can apply for full stack jobs
81:28 - that's three different opportunities you
81:30 - can apply for
81:31 - right so as a full stack developer on
81:34 - top of that
81:35 - at your job at your job you will have
81:38 - the ability to understand other
81:40 - developers right so when you are working
81:42 - when i am working for example with
81:44 - a back-end developer i will be talking
81:46 - with a back-end developer
81:47 - right for example i'm currently a
81:49 - front-end developer and i'm talking with
81:50 - a backup developer and we're trying to
81:52 - create a feature
81:53 - okay right because i know how back-end
81:55 - development works because i've done that
81:57 - before
81:58 - i can fully understand and the
82:00 - communication is so much easier
82:02 - communication communication
82:06 - is so much easier
82:11 - okay okay you will be not on top of that
82:14 - you will be respected
82:17 - a lot expected i mean you're gonna
82:20 - you're gonna be respected in either case
82:22 - but you will also and you will also be
82:24 - the person who
82:25 - uh will be relied on
82:29 - right so they're going to rely because
82:31 - you understand both sides of the coin
82:34 - they will know that okay this guy will
82:36 - not only have to take over the front end
82:38 - but he will be able to take care of the
82:39 - back end
82:40 - and this stuff is especially important
82:42 - important
82:43 - like when you are going into important
82:46 - when you are in you know
82:50 - important in uh startups
82:54 - right startups they're looking for that
82:56 - that's exactly what they're looking for
82:57 - they're looking for someone who can do
82:58 - front end back end marketing uh what
83:01 - else

83:05 - and marketing you know
83:06 - uh i don't know if you want to do

84:45 - put the spotify column build a slack
84:46 - clone
84:47 - right well go ahead and join a a
84:50 - coding community right build that
84:52 - momentum please
84:53 - do not just stop here because that's
84:56 - what you need to do right
84:57 - so if you need to go ahead and write

85:04 - projects to that
85:04 - i mean you do need to build projects in
85:07 - either case
85:08 - but it just takes some work and that is

85:38 - really good framework as well but um you
85:39 - know
85:40 - we've got some pretty cool frameworks
85:42 - right now which is uh which is uh you
85:44 - know reactor yes and and so forth and no
85:46 - gs
85:47 - mern stack or django
85:52 - mercedes or django good question
85:55 - mercedes i would say both
85:58 - both are good the more here's what you
86:00 - think about it guys okay
86:02 - the more tools in your two build the
86:04 - better you're gonna be so if you
86:06 - if you now obviously you want to start
86:07 - out with one right so let's say you know
86:09 - if you know javascript i know go the
86:12 - mern stack route
86:13 - right where you're going to learn [ __ ]
86:14 - you're going to learn node.js you're
86:16 - going to learn react
86:17 - and so forth express right that's going
86:19 - to be that route
86:21 - if you know some python learn django
86:24 - that's it so it's really that easy if
86:26 - you don't know any
86:27 - you can start with reacting and start no
86:29 - no gs that's gonna be your options
86:32 - got it but obviously your goal is to not
86:34 - only stick with money your goal is to
86:36 - know as many as
86:37 - your goal is to just like have
86:39 - experienced
86:41 - many different things and know what they
86:42 - can do
86:44 - i've done mango i've done jingle i've
86:46 - done react i've done
86:47 - angular right i've done a little bit of
86:50 - you right so you want to kind of like
86:51 - plant
86:52 - seeds you kind of want to plant seeds a
86:53 - little little by little

87:52 - let me see mongodb
87:55 - or sequel no that's not the one that's
87:59 - not what i wanna
88:02 - am gonna be your sequel you wanna learn
88:04 - both for sure right uh again
88:06 - a lot of my answers gonna be both guys
88:08 - because as a developer you should you
88:10 - should know
88:10 - a few different things let's see deeper
88:13 - engineer or software development
88:15 - engineer
88:16 - i mean i mean you guys asked me so here
88:20 - deep learning engineer or software
88:21 - development engineer
88:26 - i mean depends that's my answer a lot of
88:29 - this is depends
88:33 - depends guys nope oh [ __ ]
88:36 - my bad all bullocks
88:40 - that's how you said that is that how you
88:41 - say your son oh bollocks i don't know
88:43 - i don't know i don't have the accent or
88:45 - the british accent or anything like that
88:46 - but
88:46 - neither case so it it all at all depends
88:49 - guys
88:51 - right when you do deep learning you
88:53 - gotta work a lot with data
88:54 - so deeply is going to involve a lot of
88:56 - data it's going to a lot
88:58 - involve a lot of analysis
89:03 - and so it really depends on which you
89:04 - like um if you like data if you're not
89:07 - if you like analysis except i have a
89:09 - friend who likes data
89:10 - right and she and so she does data she
89:13 - does data science she works out data she
89:14 - works with databases and so forth
89:16 - okay um now if you're going into that
89:19 - then you might want to get into deep
89:20 - learning
89:21 - if you like to from build front-end
89:22 - applications or back-end applications
89:24 - that you want to go into
89:25 - software development engineer right so
89:27 - if you're going to build like
89:28 - for example applications like facebook
89:31 - apps
89:32 - right or for example like netflix
89:35 - netflix front-end
89:37 - netflix netflix front end
89:42 - netflix front end you're going to be go
89:45 - more towards the route of a software
89:47 - development route so
89:48 - again really depends on what you guys
89:50 - like okay
89:52 - what you guys like all right let's see
89:55 - if peter j do you help students with

91:12 - we do know gs
91:14 - we do react gs we do javascript we do we
91:16 - teach you the basics right
91:17 - we do crazy projects like building a
91:20 - blog for example like building a twitter
91:22 - clone for example like building a
91:23 - spotify clone right
91:24 - we teach you and we go dig deep into all
91:26 - those specific things
91:28 - we teach how to build a google maps
91:29 - project right that we took straight from
91:31 - upwork right
91:32 - and and so much so much more this right
91:36 - here
91:36 - is a living and breathing product profit
91:39 - with javascript
91:40 - is a living and breathing product it's
91:42 - now it's like you get it and that's it
91:44 - when you get it any improvement we build
91:48 - on top of it
91:49 - you're going to get that as well
91:52 - [Music]
91:54 - you're going to get that as well so we
91:56 - keep improving we have coaching calls
91:58 - every single week right where we provide
92:00 - to students where we building projects
92:02 - currently for example i am building a
92:04 - project a netflix clone with students
92:06 - and and so we are literally taking that
92:09 - from the start from the beginning
92:12 - from like core basics of html basics you
92:15 - see it says basis of javascript
92:17 - and we're building up on top of that
92:19 - okay that's for beginners but we also
92:21 - have a route for more intermediates
92:22 - right
92:23 - which is if you want to go the react
92:24 - route and so sunny is taking care of
92:26 - that portion right
92:27 - where he'll help you build a spotify
92:28 - clone you know
92:30 - um for example a slack clone any clones
92:32 - that you know that you guys have been

93:06 - building tutorials from youtube that's
93:08 - gonna be
93:08 - a good start for you all right guys i
93:10 - think that's gonna we're gonna end it at
93:12 - this point guys
93:13 - i am i was very happy to go ahead and
93:15 - answer a lot of your questions you had
93:16 - so many questions let me see
93:18 - actually i followed the facebook loan
93:19 - now i'm working on a microsoft teams
93:21 - clone of my own
93:23 - using react wait what no way hey let's
93:25 - go hold on it says
93:31 - i worked in on a facebook loan so
93:33 - because says
93:34 - i want a facebook and now i'm working on
93:36 - microsoft clone
93:38 - microsoft clone right here of my own
93:41 - using react router and a bunch of
93:43 - other stuff nice job nice job that is
93:45 - epic give some fire and some claps
93:49 - for because i don't know how to say that
93:51 - properly but you know
93:53 - all right let's continue on
93:57 - all right i'm data scientist and use
94:00 - let's see what else
94:03 - see
94:06 - [Music]
94:09 - okay i'm a data data scientist and use
94:11 - and love python sql hadoop and machine
94:13 - learning all day
94:14 - i prefer star development aspect of my
94:16 - job big telecoms company
94:18 - do i need to know front end if you like
94:21 - for example
94:22 - and you love python sql and hadoop and
94:24 - machine learning um
94:26 - just you know keep going with that if
94:28 - that's something you're into
94:30 - keep doing that look seriously
94:33 - you know again you know a lot of this
94:35 - depends on what field you know you wanna
94:36 - you might if you want you can try for
94:38 - example react
94:40 - you can try javascript and because we've
94:42 - actually had a lot of students who have
94:43 - done like data science
94:44 - then they've tried react they've tried
94:46 - front end and now they really like that
94:48 - portion too
94:50 - there's no harm what is the worst thing
94:52 - that can happen
94:53 - but you learning something new huh you
94:55 - tell
94:56 - me i don't know
94:59 - so yeah so there's no harm in doing that
95:01 - whatsoever
95:03 - but if you're going the route of python
95:04 - that's something you want to keep
95:05 - improving on
95:06 - keep doing that really you know go 10x
95:10 - 10x on that specific topic and python on
95:13 - sql on hadoop and machine learning
95:14 - and then you'll just see yourself
95:15 - skyrocket like crazy you know
95:18 - to the 10x squared to the square root
95:20 - now that square root does not make sense
95:22 - you know you're gonna take yourself to
95:23 - the you know infinity and beyond as we
95:25 - say you know infinity and beyond
95:29 - alrighty guys
95:33 - somebody asked will ai take away our
95:35 - development jobs no it will not guys
95:37 - maybe one day we'll see um
95:40 - my thinking is no it will not take our
95:42 - web development jobs
95:44 - there will actually be more the web
95:45 - development jobs created because now you
95:47 - need to build the ai
95:48 - so there you go that's going to be
95:50 - answered for
95:52 - that's going to be my answer there
95:55 - let's see any other questions are there
95:57 - any other questions
95:58 - guys let us know let me know in the
96:00 - comments below if you've joined the
96:01 - webinar did you
96:02 - join the webinar for tomorrow and are
96:04 - you pumped
96:06 - for tomorrow's webinar where sonny and
96:07 - kazi are going to be covering how to
96:10 - become
96:10 - a react javascript developer guys
96:13 - so if you're pumped for that let me know
96:16 - in the comments below and if you have
96:18 - joined that webinar did you join it
96:22 - frankie tell them to join the webinar

96:30 - webinar too
96:31 - you're going to be there yep
96:42 - says yes let me see
96:48 - another question
97:00 - i'm learning javascript is it okay if i
97:02 - start react before node.js
97:04 - yes a hundred percent it is okay
97:07 - okay reason why is because those are two
97:11 - different technologies like justice
97:12 - frontier node.js is backend
97:15 - if you know reg gs before now gs that's
97:17 - completely fine that's actually
97:18 - what most people probably will do
97:20 - because they will learn front end and
97:21 - then they will learn back in so yeah
97:23 - that's not a problem at all
97:25 - let's see another questions guys
97:29 - make sure let me know in the comments
