00:00 - let me tell you about the most pivotal
00:02 - moment
00:03 - in my software career i can attribute
00:05 - this exact moment to being the reason
00:07 - why
00:07 - i was able to crush my interview with
00:09 - google microsoft and blue origin
00:11 - i couldn't even believe that these
00:13 - things were achievable like getting a
00:15 - job at google
00:16 - i can't do that but after this moment
00:19 - i was able to get the confidence and the
00:21 - skills that i needed to completely shine
00:23 - on those interviews and this is the
00:25 - origin of data structures poppy
00:28 - so how did it start for me well i
00:30 - clearly remember one day at my
00:32 - university
00:32 - three google software engineers came to
00:35 - visit sort of for like a recruiting
00:36 - event and everyone was all hyped about
00:38 - it all my classmates were like man i'm
00:40 - gonna network with that person i'm gonna
00:41 - go become that person's best friend get
00:42 - the job i was just like whoa like a
00:44 - google software developer it was like a
00:46 - pokemon or something just something i
00:48 - wasn't ever going to see in my entire
00:50 - life so when they came
00:51 - they told us about what it is and what
00:53 - it takes to get a job there but in the
00:54 - back of my head i was still always
00:56 - thinking
00:57 - man that's just not me i'm never gonna
00:59 - be able to get those opportunities
01:01 - i specifically remember thinking that
01:02 - thought when there's the part where
01:03 - they're doing
01:04 - a mock interview two of the googlers
01:07 - went up to the white board and then
01:08 - one of them asked a question write me a
01:11 - function that can find me the path
01:13 - from a to b and literally my mouth just
01:16 - dropped
01:17 - because i couldn't even comprehend on
01:19 - where to begin
01:20 - this is where i was like i'm never gonna
01:22 - become a googler and it was so crazy
01:24 - because it was like a magic show
01:26 - literally
01:27 - the other developer just started to go
01:29 - through the problem
01:30 - break it down into the different pieces
01:32 - solve each part write this amazing
01:34 - function this algorithm
01:38 - using the right data structures to find
01:40 - the shortest path
01:41 - and for me this was a magic show this
01:43 - was like when you're a little kid
01:45 - and you see the magician pull the bunny
01:46 - out of the hat and you're just
01:47 - absolutely amazed
01:49 - so after that i was determined to have a
01:51 - conversation
01:52 - with that software developer i was
01:54 - determined to go up to him and ask him
01:55 - like
01:56 - how can i get this so that's exactly
01:57 - what i did i was super scared i was
01:58 - super nervous
01:59 - walking up to the guy i remember my
02:01 - hands were shaky palms were a little bit
02:02 - sweaty
02:03 - mom's spaghetti and then all of a sudden
02:05 - i go up to him and then i kind of just
02:07 - ask him hey man like honestly i i've
02:10 - never seen myself
02:11 - being able to work at google just
02:13 - because it's been like a dream
02:14 - for you like how were you able to do it
02:17 - and then he kind of started to tell me
02:18 - his story he was telling me how he was a
02:20 - developer he started working at a
02:22 - company in fact he graduated from the
02:23 - same university that i did and that gave
02:25 - me hope
02:25 - and he started working at some company
02:27 - moved to another one three years later
02:28 - and finally google recruiter reached out
02:29 - to him he had three weeks to prep for
02:31 - the interview
02:32 - and what he did for those three weeks
02:33 - was he went hard into the basics of
02:35 - programming the data structure and
02:37 - algorithms literally he told me his
02:38 - schedule
02:39 - was he would work nine to five after
02:41 - five from
02:42 - five to eight pm monday through friday
02:44 - he would do white boarding problems just
02:46 - solving problem after problem after
02:48 - problem then on the weekend
02:50 - he would do six to eight hours each day
02:52 - both saturday and sunday
02:53 - or more problem solving and when he told
02:56 - me that
02:57 - when he told me that that is when
02:59 - everything changed for me because that
03:01 - is when i realized
03:02 - if this amazing developer in front of me
03:04 - was able to get there
03:06 - you know starting from the similar
03:07 - position where i'm at from the same
03:08 - university it's not like a huge
03:10 - university it's not a prestigious
03:11 - university in fact it's a university
03:13 - that has a 100 acceptance rate
03:15 - what like no one gets rejected going
03:17 - into the university that i went to right
03:19 - he was able to go there and end up at
03:20 - google and not only that when i realized
03:23 - that data structures and algorithms
03:24 - was simply just a skill that's when
03:27 - everything changed for me this is that
03:28 - pivotal moment because i realized
03:30 - the skill i realized i can learn that
03:33 - skill
03:33 - i realize i can build that confidence
03:36 - because confidence comes from one thing
03:37 - and one thing only
03:38 - how well do you know something when you
03:41 - know something
03:42 - to a high level every detail you're
03:44 - going to be super confident
03:46 - when you perform that task and that's
03:48 - what i realized
03:49 - i just had to do more repetition so from
03:52 - that day forward
03:53 - every single day for 30 minutes a day i
03:55 - solved
03:56 - one algorithm problem and i did it again
03:58 - and again and again and again i'm not
04:00 - gonna lie i miss some days but i just
04:01 - did it over and over and over again
04:04 - and that allowed me to start to build so
04:06 - much competence that i could distinguish
04:08 - what are the different things that i
04:10 - have to do to solve these different
04:11 - problems i was able to show up with the
04:13 - confidence
04:14 - i was able to crush those interviews and
04:16 - i was able to get
04:18 - the job offers and the rest is history
04:20 - that's how data structures papi was born
04:24 - of course i'm not a guru guys i'm just a
04:27 - regular person
04:28 - i just developed the right skill set so
04:30 - what i want to get to right now is i
04:31 - want to make the magic show
04:33 - i'm going to solve the exact same
04:35 - problem that that google developer
04:37 - solved in front of me
04:38 - that got me inspired to take action
04:40 - because i want to inspire
04:42 - you to be able to go out there and build
04:44 - the skill set that you need so let's go
04:46 - ahead
04:46 - and jump into that problem guys and here
04:49 - we are
04:50 - finding the shortest path from the top
04:52 - left to the bottom right
04:54 - of this array i'm not gonna lie this is
04:55 - probably not the exact same problem
04:57 - that they did but let's go ahead and
04:59 - dive into this let's go ahead and solve
05:00 - this problem so what i always want to
05:02 - start off doing is kind of replicating
05:04 - the problem here i get on my whiteboard
05:05 - i'm gonna replicate the same array that
05:07 - they have in the lead code example
05:09 - so i have a great starting point now
05:11 - what i start to notice is there's going
05:12 - to be a specific pattern here it's going
05:14 - to get me the shortest path since i'm
05:16 - going from the top
05:17 - left all the way to the bottom right i
05:18 - can only go to the right or down
05:21 - from each square to the next square
05:23 - knowing this well i could create another
05:25 - array that at
05:26 - every specific position that's going to
05:28 - represent the minimum
05:29 - sum needed to get to that point here the
05:31 - first value in the top left
05:33 - will just be the same from the original
05:34 - array the first row and the first column
05:37 - will also be unique
05:38 - because we can only travel in one
05:39 - direction we would just get the value
05:41 - at that same position adding the sum of
05:43 - the previous positions so that gets us
05:45 - the minimum path because there's only
05:47 - one path however when we start to look
05:49 - at the other positions you could take
05:51 - two different paths one coming from the
05:52 - top
05:53 - and one coming from the left so on those
05:55 - we're then compared to see which one has
05:57 - the minimum number by adding the current
05:59 - position and the previous path
06:01 - so let me go ahead and code it up now
06:03 - cool so now when we actually start to
06:04 - code the first thing i like to do is
06:06 - write my pseudo code i just write it on
06:07 - comments because these are the steps i'm
06:09 - gonna have to take now these are the
06:10 - specific steps that i just talked you
06:12 - through of having the minimum path so i
06:14 - start with the very first implementation
06:15 - this is just creating my array of zeros
06:17 - simple double for loop next thing is
06:19 - setting the initial zero zero
06:21 - as well as now getting all of the first
06:24 - column and all of the first rows now by
06:26 - the way there's actually a bug here that
06:27 - i was stuck on for a bit
06:28 - let's see if you could figure it out
06:29 - before we get to the bug reveal but
06:31 - again this is just two simple loops to
06:33 - fill
06:34 - out the summation of my first row and
06:36 - the summation of my first column because
06:38 - those are the ones that i don't have to
06:39 - do different combinations so from there
06:41 - we go over to actually getting the
06:43 - summations of all of the different
06:45 - positions
06:46 - inside of my summations array all i have
06:47 - to do is i have to add the current value
06:50 - of the specific
06:50 - ij position on the grid and then just
06:53 - get the minimum
06:54 - of either one position to the left or
06:57 - one position to the top
06:59 - because that minimum is going to give me
07:00 - the shortest path there
07:02 - and boom here's the celebration that you
07:04 - always have to have
07:05 - whenever you think you figured it out
07:10 - it was at this moment that he knew he
07:12 -  up
07:14 - it did take me a while to figure this
07:16 - one out my code only worked for
07:17 - square studio race not for rectangular
07:19 - 2d array because
07:21 - if you look at my first loop the
07:22 - conditional statement was wrong
07:24 - let's go so that is how that is done
07:28 - that is magic
07:29 - i hope that you saw how the magic works
07:30 - i hope that this kind of inspired you
07:32 - to really dive into data structures
07:34 - algorithms because that's what we did
07:36 - here right we were able to kind of get
07:38 - this problem
07:39 - that we had and they were able to draw
07:40 - it out kind of come to a solution
07:42 - and finally we were able to implement it
07:44 - so guys this is why data structure's not
07:46 - going to be so important
07:47 - you could just do this you could get
07:48 - better every single
07:50 - time i am not a guru i'm just a regular
07:53 - person
07:54 - i just worked on enough of these that i
07:55 - was able to kind of figure out
07:57 - what it was that i needed to do next you
07:59 - can get to this point in fact you could
08:01 - probably get even better results
08:03 - than i did you just have to practice and
08:05 - it's going to take
08:06 - time to get there it's going to take
08:08 - patience but we are here
08:10 - for you so with that being said i hope
08:12 - you got value
08:13 - from this video if you did go ahead hit
08:15 - that like button
08:16 - comment below let me know what you guys
08:18 - want to see more with data structures
08:19 - and
08:19 - algorithms because i want to give you
08:21 - guys more value to help you crush it to
08:23 - help you
08:25 - on your next interview so you could get
08:26 - that job offer so you could have that
08:28 - confidence
08:29 - not be like how i was before but
08:31 - actually being able to move towards
08:32 - having the goals that you want all right
08:34 - guys that is it for coach daniel
08:36 - i will see you in the next one peace
