04:18 - let's see which one should i pick
04:20 - there's a circle one this looks like fun
04:23 - i'm i kind of suck at css so i'm just
04:26 - gonna pick like a random battle here to
04:28 - do let's start with this one actually
04:32 - that one looks
04:34 - not too crazy so let's start with that
04:37 - a dark code lab says we played chess
04:39 - yesterday yes we did
04:41 - nice back from the future says your
04:42 - content is like watching netflix always
04:44 - engaging thanks for that i appreciate
04:46 - that coding mastery
04:48 - um i'll tell you guys my font when i'm
04:50 - actually coding in visual studio code
04:52 - because i don't even know
04:53 - honestly the top of my head like that
04:57 - like i have no idea what i'm using
05:01 - okay let me zoom in my screen for you
05:05 - guys here
05:08 - okay so that should be nice and zoomed
05:10 - in for you guys
05:12 - and then i'll bring my face down here so
05:15 - it doesn't really get in the way of
05:16 - anything
05:17 - but yeah thank you guys for subscribing
05:18 - that's awesome
05:22 - hershey says dude you are just awesome
05:24 - thank you brother
05:25 - appreciate you this is really this is
05:28 - good vibes i hope you guys can hear the
05:29 - music and you guys are enjoying
05:31 - and uh let's just go and figure this uh
05:33 - battle out now
05:35 - so i'm gonna i'm gonna figure this out
05:37 - with you guys okay
05:39 - so let's go all right so we're supposed
05:43 - to make this thing
05:44 - over here on the right hand side and
05:47 - we're currently on the left hand side
05:49 - here
05:49 - so the first thing i'm gonna do do is
05:53 - let's grab the background
05:57 - and give it that color all right
06:00 - so that's pretty good okay we made
06:03 - decent progress so far so we got the
06:05 - background color
06:06 - now we're gonna make our square
06:10 - that same color as that yellow so let's
06:13 - go ahead
06:13 - and do that okay so we got that
06:18 - i think my strategy is going to be to
06:20 - bring this
06:22 - down here and then give it maybe some
06:25 - border radius and i hope that
06:27 - does kind of what i'm looking for
06:30 - actually
06:31 - i'll give it a class name of
06:35 - yellow i think that should be good
06:38 - oh how about banana
06:45 - all right let's give it a class name of
06:46 - banana
06:49 - uh and then let's see if i can actually
06:52 - grab banana
06:54 - ay that works that's nice
06:57 - harshit shoharda says your videos help
07:01 - me learn
07:02 - so much react hey that's amazing
07:05 - glad to hear that glad to hear i could
07:07 - help
07:10 - that's awesome
07:13 - that's really cool okay
07:19 - say it says proper beard you got now
07:21 - absolutely
07:22 - ahmad says please live stream on how to
07:24 - make and accept payments of
07:25 - cryptocurrencies one day for sure
07:29 - okay
07:33 - all right here we go so now let's
07:34 - actually move this square
07:36 - and can i do margin left
07:40 - 2 em yep that works 4 am
07:43 - five six something like that okay
07:46 - and then let's bring it down margin top
07:50 - oh it's two down 5am maybe
07:53 - okay now maybe let's make this square
07:55 - like a lot bigger
08:01 - uh maybe the width is too big
08:05 - i think that should be good
08:12 - okay and now let's maybe play with some
08:15 - border radius
08:20 - uh will that work
08:25 - okay
08:30 - so if i give it a lot of border radius
08:33 - okay so i can give it some border radius
08:36 - from the top
08:38 - and is there a border radius i can give
08:40 - it from the bottom two nope
08:42 - here nope that's not doing what i wanted
08:45 - to do
08:46 - is that doing what i wanted to do whoa
08:49 - [Music]
08:51 - that kind of worked now maybe let's make
08:54 - the width
08:55 - 100 yo i can't believe it
08:58 - that is sick that is sick
09:04 - i love it i'm like this gives me an
09:06 - incentive to actually learn css with you
09:08 - guys
09:10 - so it's definitely good vibes
09:13 - raj nice
09:16 - um okay
09:20 - so that worked so now i'll do the same
09:22 - thing with the other one
09:25 - uh and i think the other one is more
09:27 - like a peach
09:28 - so we'll call it peach class i'll do the
09:31 - same thing here
09:34 - and we'll do peach and i wonder if i can
09:38 - just give it a
09:40 - negative 4 am
09:44 - and negative 3.
09:50 - interesting really thought that would
09:52 - work
09:55 - why is it at the bottom
10:02 - maybe i can position absolute this
10:08 - that is not helping let's change the
10:10 - color
10:12 - oh it's mixed with the background that's
10:14 - not the color it's this color
10:17 - okay i see it at the bottom let's go
10:19 - margin
10:21 - zero okay
10:28 - maybe position absolute this as well
10:30 - okay do i still need to position
10:33 - absolute this
10:34 - sure okay that kind of works let's go
10:37 - negative 4am
10:40 - no margin right
10:46 - what happens if i comment this out okay
10:50 - that's fine 15
10:57 - okay that's pretty good
11:00 - let's move it down a little bit nice and
11:03 - now i gotta
11:03 - flip it the other way how oh
11:07 - the border radius just needs to be
11:08 - flipped
11:10 - can i do negative seven and negative
11:12 - seven no
11:15 - sometimes me just playing i just play
11:17 - around with this guys until
11:19 - something works or something makes sense
11:22 - oh snap son yo
11:26 - i think we got it let's go jefferson
11:29 - esteva says transform translate
11:31 - jefferson that might actually help
11:36 - anybody that's good at css that'd be

15:06 - okay let's see if there's any other
15:08 - challenge it's going to be really good
15:10 - otherwise we can do some object
15:12 - recognition with
15:14 - hot chocolate marshmallows let me
15:18 - try to unplug this
15:26 - okay
15:29 - all right i'm going to relocate guys
15:31 - because
15:33 - my roommates are very inconsiderate and
15:35 - very very loud
15:38 - so we're going to relocate
15:41 - okay all right i'm surprised the
15:44 - internet is working
15:46 - okay that's pretty freaking good
15:49 - what are you guys saying
15:55 - kashyap says bro i have been looking for
15:57 - wait
15:58 - i didn't mean to ban you i'm sorry
16:02 - kashyap says bro i've been looking for
16:03 - object recognition using python for
16:05 - months but i did not get any results can
16:07 - you make a video for that please
16:09 - yeah i'm sure that we can actually talk
16:11 - about that too welcome we have 182
16:13 - people live that's amazing
16:15 - vasim says your clones are amazing thank
16:17 - you so much brother appreciate it
16:19 - okay yeah i think something with object
16:23 - recognition could be a lot of fun i
16:24 - could show you guys probably with
16:26 - javascript or python i think either
16:29 - would be really really cool
16:31 - actually let's take a look javascript
16:33 - object recognition i haven't done a lot
16:36 - of uh
16:37 - recognition stuff but that could be
16:39 - really cool let's look it up
16:42 - we got tensorflow here okay detecting
16:45 - objects
16:48 - okay model image
16:51 - does somebody have some sample code
16:54 - maybe like a github repo
16:56 - and we could pull it from there
16:59 - link to the full code interesting okay
17:04 - so let's see
17:09 - allow them to use my camera okay sick
17:14 - um oh it's detecting the person
17:18 - what the yo ed's detecting a bed
17:22 - i'm on a couch
17:25 - what whoa
17:30 - [Music]
17:31 - that is crazy it's
17:34 - already working what the heck
17:38 - okay let's see if it detects the tv
17:42 - okay does it detect a tv
17:46 - okay don't have to point it oh my god
17:50 - it's already working yo problem solved
17:53 - you guys gave me a challenge we already
17:56 - did that challenge
17:58 - that is sick image detection
18:01 - with javascript bro
18:03 - look at the thing we got two persons oh
18:05 - that tensorflow right tensorflow
18:07 - yeah look we got uh pillow
18:11 - yeah it detects everything it detected
18:13 - the tv it was crazy it said tv
18:16 - it was nuts yeah this is freaking
18:19 - one of the people said hey they wanted
18:21 - to use uh
18:22 - they wanted to learn object oriented
18:24 - programming
18:25 - so classes we did some stuff
18:29 - yeah this is freaking crazy guys okay
18:32 - let's take a look at the code
18:34 - and let's see what's happening so let's
18:36 - let's see
18:38 - what is happening so they're actually it
18:40 - looks like they're using
18:41 - react to do this which is pretty
18:45 - freaking cool
18:46 - uh they're using object oriented
18:48 - programming so we have component did
18:50 - mount
18:52 - okay um
18:56 - if navigator i'm gonna move this to the
18:59 - right hand side here
19:01 - so i can see the code and understand it
19:06 - all right so navigator.mediadevice
19:11 - i'm assuming that something that comes
19:13 - built in
19:14 - with
19:17 - where is navigator coming from is this a
19:19 - javascript thing or is this
19:22 - a
19:24 - navigator dot navigator dot
19:28 - media devices
19:35 - oh i think that actually might just be a
19:37 - javascript thing
19:43 - yeah i think that's the javascript thing
19:46 - you guys it's the javascript that's
19:47 - pretty cool
19:48 - and what does it actually do let's look
19:50 - at mozilla firefox it says it gets
19:54 - fired when a media input output device
19:56 - is attached or
19:58 - removed from the user's computer nice
20:00 - okay
20:02 - that's cool
20:05 - luke is writing us a message what's up
20:07 - luke how's it going brother
20:12 - luke says that's lit yeah it is pretty
20:14 - freaking crazy
20:16 - and it's working that's the crazy thing
20:22 - okay um so if media devices exist
20:27 - then do the following thing okay this
20:30 - that's what that n and chaining means so
20:33 - if they exist
20:34 - then go ahead and
20:38 - get the user media okay
20:42 - and i'm assuming that's the video that
20:44 - we're getting right now
20:47 - and webcam promise is going to be
20:48 - navigator media
20:50 - dot get user media okay um and get user
20:55 - media takes an object and we say audio
20:57 - false we don't need the audio we just
20:59 - need the
21:00 - video okay facing mode is user okay cool
21:04 - so for example i think if you had a
21:06 - mobile device it would by default start
21:08 - with facing you
21:10 - as opposed to away from you okay so
21:12 - let's take a look at
21:17 - the documentation for this
21:21 - user facing facing mode user right
21:26 - facing mode environment you see that to
21:28 - require the rear camera
21:30 - use uh environment so i imagine if you
21:33 - use environment it will actually face
21:35 - the other way which is so freaking
21:37 - which is pretty dope which is a i never
21:39 - knew that that's cool
21:41 - okay and then once we get the promise
21:46 - okay make the current window to be the
21:48 - actual stream that we're getting
21:51 - all right okay so stream is gonna be
21:54 - like something we're getting like
21:56 - probably every frame right this promise
21:58 - is running i imagine and it's getting
21:59 - every single frame
22:02 - all right wow we're freaking machine
22:04 - learning with javascript right now guys
22:07 - are you guys excited or what
22:10 - this is amazing i'm pretty excited
22:15 - cool good vibes pro eska says good vibes
22:19 - matthaub says yeah it is
22:23 - do you own dogecoin nice
22:27 - okay and then what happens we get the
22:30 - metadata
22:32 - and we resolve the promise okay we
22:34 - resolve it
22:36 - model promise load promise all these are
22:39 - the two promises we want them to run
22:41 - once this is the cool thing about
22:43 - promise.all by the way guys
22:44 - if you if you don't know this add
22:47 - promise.all to your uh
22:50 - to your list of things for you to know
22:53 - or learn
22:54 - let me move this here and make this
22:57 - bigger
22:58 - okay so you guys can very very clearly
23:01 - see this
23:03 - but promise.all is awesome you give it
23:06 - an array of the other promises
23:08 - and once both of them are done and
23:10 - resolved
23:11 - then and only then this fires so
23:14 - really cool thing that you guys can use
23:16 - whenever you have multiple promises
23:19 - you can run them up you can run them all
23:21 - together like that
23:22 - okay so then your code is cleaner and
23:24 - you don't have to write those like
23:25 - really long dot then chains with dot
23:28 - then dot then dot then okay
23:30 - use promise.all i think it's a very es6c
23:34 - esxy way of doing it i think we just
23:37 - coined a new term
23:38 - yes sexy okay
23:42 - oh wait this is a comment
23:46 - why is it freaking out okay whatever
23:51 - what happened what did i mess up let's
23:54 - refresh
23:56 - i broke the app
24:00 - how did i break that okay all right
24:04 - let's
24:04 - try not to break the app okay
24:08 - then let's go through the rest of this
24:09 - code what is happening
24:12 - okay so you guys can go here to this url
24:16 - and get access to this code as well all
24:19 - right
24:21 - but let's go down detect
24:24 - frame all right so probably get the
24:28 - first
24:29 - value of the frame
24:32 - value zero all right
24:38 - so what what is let me try one
24:49 - let's go back
24:53 - so another thing i like to do is just
24:55 - play around with the code okay break
24:57 -  like try different things this is
25:00 - somebody else's code i didn't sit there
25:01 - and write it so the best way to pick it
25:03 - up is just debug it like go to random
25:04 - places
25:06 - try different things you'll pick it up
25:08 - faster but reading people's code will
25:10 - also make you good like right now we're
25:12 - just
25:13 - looking at somebody's machine learning
25:15 - uh or tensorflow object detection
25:17 - algorithm
25:19 - and we're just here and we're like okay
25:20 - let's just play with it let's see what
25:22 - we get okay let's see what we can
25:23 - understand
25:25 - detect frame video and model i think
25:27 - this is where the machine learning
25:28 - is happening model that detect video
25:31 - once you detect it
25:32 - then make the predictions that makes a
25:35 - lot of sense
25:36 - okay once you detect the video then make
25:39 - the predictions
25:41 - all right render predictions
25:45 - request animation frame frame video
25:48 - model
25:49 - okay and then here are the render
25:51 - predictions
25:54 - okay so this is that function render
25:56 - predictions and let's see what this
25:58 - is render predictions
26:03 - okay so one thing we're doing is we're
26:05 - making this uh
26:06 - rectangle okay and this is
26:10 - the rectangle that's being made around
26:12 - my face
26:13 - right there where it says person
26:17 - okay and that's how we're making it
26:19 - we're making a rectangle we're choosing
26:21 - our font to be sans-serif that's how
26:22 - we're seeing the bed and right
26:24 - like for example if i just change this
26:26 - to like 24px
26:28 - you guys are going to notice that once
26:30 - of course it crashes
26:32 - let me see if there's a way i can save
26:34 - hit refresh and it
26:36 - hopefully loads the new code
26:41 - so now see the size of bed in person is
26:43 - a lot bigger right because i
26:45 - changed it and it worked so great now i
26:47 - understand that that's how the fonts are
26:49 - changing about the code
26:51 - okay baseline is at the top so i imagine
26:54 - you could
26:54 - change the text baseline and it'll move
26:56 - it to the bottom or somewhere else
27:00 - cool and then we're looping through the
27:02 - predictions
27:04 - so we have box one and we have box
27:07 - another box
27:08 - prediction box two three okay
27:11 - so what is let's look up prediction
27:15 - b box and let's see what we get in
27:17 - documentation
27:18 - i'll write a tensorflow i think it's a
27:21 - tensorflow thing
27:23 - bounding box regression so that's what
27:26 - be box is okay
27:28 - bounding box and that's the box you can
27:31 - use to bound and detect like okay
27:33 - there's the airplane
27:41 - okay a lot of coding is like just
27:44 -  around with things and playing
27:46 - yes if you're a scientist maybe certain
27:49 - things can help but like unfortunately
27:51 - i'm not a scientist okay
27:53 - so for me looking at the math or the
27:55 - formulas
27:56 - doesn't really help me that much but me
27:58 - just playing around with it
28:00 - breaking the code having fun
28:03 - i just learned a lot better like that
28:05 - right so
28:08 - let me let me see is there anything else
28:10 - that gives me a better
28:12 - indicator of how to use this so let's go
28:14 - here
28:17 - tutorial just so i can maybe get a
28:20 - little better insight
28:21 - possibly into uh
28:26 - how to use tensorflow and react.js
28:28 - that's what i'm looking for
28:30 - okay so cell phone
28:33 - 96 sure that that's a cell phone
28:36 - okay machine learning library
28:39 - so tensorflow is a library for machine
28:42 - learning in javascript which enables
28:43 - machine learning models
28:45 - to be used directly in the browser okay
28:49 - so freaking powerful right because we're
28:51 - just using machine learning and unlike
28:53 - python
28:55 - guys like we didn't have to install
28:56 - anything right we didn't have to
28:58 - download anything this is so freaking
29:00 - easy it's just working straight out of
29:02 - the box
29:04 - i can't see your guys's text or chat
29:07 - messages i think it'd be kind of cool to
29:09 - see them
29:10 - so let me see if there is some way
29:13 - i can see them
29:16 - um
29:19 - it's chunky i think i might have to do
29:22 - box for them to like
29:31 - maybe that will make your guys's chat
29:33 - messages pop out a little bit more
29:35 - let's see okay
29:39 - so we have object detection going here
29:42 - right we have dog and a cat
29:44 - okay thank you somebody said you are
29:48 - awesome
29:50 - input image extract region compute cnn
29:53 - features and then classify regions
29:55 - okay so that's how the algorithm works
29:58 - okay we input our image
30:00 - it extracts uh propor uh
30:04 - region proposals about 2 000 things it
30:06 - extracted okay
30:08 - and then it computes the features and
30:10 - then it goes hey is it an airplane nope
30:12 - is it a person
30:12 - yes is it a tv monitor no okay
30:16 - now what is coco ssd because that's
30:18 - another thing we're using
30:20 - common objects context single shot
30:22 - multi-box blah blah blah
30:24 - english please
30:29 - returns an array of bounding boxes with
30:31 - class names and confidence levels now
30:33 - that's important so for example
30:36 - that's what i'm looking for that's what
30:38 - be box is
30:39 - okay so we get
30:48 - okay so let's say that b box gets us
30:51 - four items right
30:53 - item number one item number zero or
30:56 - whatever
30:57 - right we have b box ten five five five
31:00 - nine
31:01 - and each items will have a name like
31:03 - this like traffic light
31:05 - or is it something else and then we have
31:07 - a confidence score we're 53
31:09 - sure that that's a co that's a traffic
31:11 - light okay
31:13 - so right now i don't know what
31:15 - percentage sure we are
31:17 - but there's a high likelihood that
31:19 - that's a person that i'm looking at
31:21 - right now
31:30 - okay i don't like how the text is
31:33 - looking right now
31:34 - is there a way i can like add custom css
31:38 - to that
31:40 - like
31:44 - can i add background uh
31:49 - can you guys keep chatting because i
31:51 - want to see how the chatting looks and
31:52 - maybe i can add some css to it
31:54 - so just like maybe type something smart
31:58 - okay thank you said hello okay great
32:00 - let's see if i can like
32:01 - live code up um
32:05 - maybe i can give each uh
32:11 - log emote image okay meta badge name
32:16 - thank you for such nice words by the way
32:19 - guys
32:19 - that means a lot okay so we it does have
32:23 - a background color
32:26 - but like how come
32:29 - i don't really see the background color
32:33 - okay i'm just gonna do something crappy
32:35 - and i'm just gonna write black
32:38 - and and hit save and let's see what
32:41 - happens
32:42 - if you guys chat do i get some type of
32:43 - background color behind this now
32:45 - if i don't i'm just going to move it
32:46 - back
32:48 - i'm just going to move it back to the
32:50 - way it was because i don't want to break
32:51 - anything
32:53 - okay let's go back
32:57 - all right so
33:01 - that was really useful to actually
33:03 - understand
33:05 - uh let's go back
33:10 - right here that was useful to understand
33:13 - all right x y width and
33:16 - height okay draw the bounding box and
33:19 - then we draw the bounding box
33:22 - x y width and height okay so
33:26 - um this box i think is telling us like
33:31 - the coordinates to make the box
33:34 - okay so i think each of these are a
33:37 - coordinate
33:39 - that allows us to get the box text with
33:43 - text height that's the text that you
33:44 - guys are seeing above my head probably
33:49 - all right and then we draw it out cool
33:52 - so
33:54 - look at that how insane is that we just
33:57 - give the machine learning
33:59 - once we detect the face and the image
34:00 - and the video frames we send it over to
34:02 - our machine learning algorithm guys
34:04 - there's more code here to draw the
34:06 - freaking boxer on my face
34:08 - then we even need to make the machine
34:10 - learning actually happen
34:12 - isn't that nuts
34:16 - like the machine learning part actually
34:18 - is so freaking small and short
34:20 - in this that's kind of crazy
34:24 - yeah i mean literally i think that's the
34:26 - only thing index.js
34:28 - we installed two libraries here we have
34:31 - just a couple of dependencies let's see
34:33 - what our dependencies are react magic
34:35 - drop zone
34:37 - we have a tensorflow and then tensorflow
34:40 - models cocoa whatever
34:42 - so we have just a couple of important
34:44 - dependencies
34:46 - outside of that the code is 100 lines
34:48 - and majority of the code is freaking
34:50 - drawing the box around my stupid face
34:53 - okay so
34:56 - that to me is pretty freaking cool
34:59 - really really cool
35:01 - let me see if i can actually sign and
35:02 - save this sign in with github
35:06 - because i don't want to lose this this
35:07 - is actually really really cool
35:10 - um let's uh fork this
35:14 - all right did i fork it
35:17 - fork right i should have forked it
35:25 - and what's really cool about all of this
35:28 - right let me show you guys something
35:31 - you guys can actually go to this
35:33 - freaking app
35:34 - right now that's the most insane thing
35:36 - about this
35:39 - so like do you guys want to try this i
35:41 - just deployed this freaking app you guys
35:44 - can use this
35:45 - let me check it out
35:50 - okay let me go and
35:56 - hand it to you guys right now
36:09 - oh my life keeps dying
36:14 - maybe i should not be live streaming in
36:15 - 4k
36:23 - so check that out you guys
36:27 - thank you brother you are really awesome
36:29 - too i appreciate it thank you
36:36 - okay so i just sent you guys the
36:38 - deployed app
36:40 - let me know um if you guys got it
36:44 - and check it out qazi will you bring a
36:46 - series of desktop
36:47 - application with javascript yeah i mean
36:50 - i think i was talking with one of my
36:52 - developers about this we might actually
36:54 - do that
36:55 - um we might bring electron
37:00 - thank you tamar book appreciate you
37:05 - okay so yeah that was really cool thank
37:08 - you for
37:09 - suggesting the machine learning
37:10 - algorithm thing i had a lot of fun so we
37:12 - did a css challenge
37:14 - and then we launched an app that can
37:17 - detect
37:18 - um right we
37:22 - launched an app that can detect our
37:24 - faces and who we are
37:26 - like that's so freaking cool like this
37:29 - is crazy it's already working
37:32 - damn wow
37:38 - that's cool
37:41 - now we can even make some stupid changes
37:43 - to this app where are we getting the
38:02 - so
38:10 - video
38:14 - that's cool
38:18 - i literally fell in love with javascript
38:20 - that's amazing
38:22 - that's sick i look says my comments are
38:24 - not showing up but i can see them
38:26 - i can see them that's
38:29 - cool he made a ref to video ref and
38:33 - canvas ref
38:35 - and then this canvas is just actually
38:38 - referring
38:39 - okay and where are we updating it so
38:40 - let's go
38:42 - video ref wow this is a video the
38:46 - current
38:46 - dot source object
38:50 - the actual stream
38:55 - that's dope i love reading code man i
38:58 - have a lot of fun reading code because
39:00 - you can
39:00 - take so many projects and build on top
39:03 - of them
39:04 - and you don't have to start things from
39:06 - scratch i'm really against having to sit
39:09 - there and think
39:10 - like you don't you should try to avoid
39:13 - doing that and save it for the really
39:14 - hard problems or you truly have to think
39:17 - but a lot of times like get really good
39:21 - at
39:21 - um
39:24 - get really good at like understanding
39:28 - how to solve uh or how to be really
39:30 - resourceful that's gonna help out a lot
39:41 - this is dope by the way were any of are
39:43 - any of you guys able to use this
39:45 - so far the app the deployed version of
39:48 - it
39:50 - oh socket not working on a public
39:52 - address
39:53 - i think you guys should be able to use
39:54 - it so deep they're kind of like um
39:58 - they're a little bit like using you
40:00 - state refs
40:03 - but like look up refs versus uh
40:06 - you state that's gonna help you
40:14 - thanks brother ak says uh
40:19 - that was crazy yeah that was pretty
40:21 - crazy i mean i was really excited about
40:22 - it i don't know if it was
40:24 - as exciting for you guys but to me that
40:27 - was actually pretty exciting i had a lot
40:28 - of fun doing that
40:34 - uh please guys don't spam because
40:36 - otherwise i'm gonna have to ban
40:38 - you sorry you're gonna get banned buddy
40:43 - um
40:46 - how to connect python images processing
40:48 - in react
40:50 - js um i mean i feel like you can just do
40:53 - it with react right so then you don't
40:55 - really have to
40:56 - use python there that much
40:59 - and you should be good to go okay
41:02 - this is the article and now if i want to
41:04 - read it it actually
41:05 - explains what's happening so i'm
41:07 - actually curious and i will go through
41:09 - it right now
41:12 - because we made the app now let's
41:15 - actually read how it's working
41:16 - oh 83 000 reads nice
41:33 - oh
41:36 - so a machine learning model can tell us
41:39 - what's in
41:39 - an image
41:43 - but it doesn't mean it can tell us where
41:45 - it is in the image
41:49 - okay so for example a machine learning
41:53 - algorithm can tell us
41:54 - hey this is um
41:58 - this is kazi versus say this is garyvee
42:01 - right like
42:02 - it can distinguish between two different
42:04 - human beings or a human being
42:06 - versus an animal but object detection
42:09 - can detect where that thing is in the
42:12 - image okay
42:24 - okay detecting
42:28 - objects all we need is import okay
42:33 - so coco ssd helps us detect objects it's
42:37 - really good so it's
42:38 - we're importing the tensorflow model
42:43 - yo that's easy as look at that
42:47 - image get element by image
42:50 - by id that id
42:54 - and then load and just detect damage is
42:56 - it that easy can i actually like
43:01 - can i create a div right now put an
43:04 - image in it and get detect
43:05 - what it is um super curious let's try it
43:08 - out
43:09 - where should i go to try it out let's go
43:11 - stack blitz i really like stack blitz
43:15 - stack blitz
43:19 - okay let's go
43:27 - do i want to go um
43:31 - yeah let's just go react okay
43:37 - i'm gonna sign in let's play around with
43:40 - it and let's see if it's actually that
43:41 - easy because if it is that what's
43:43 - really really cool
43:50 - that looks like vanilla javascript too
43:52 - to me so that's really awesome
43:56 - okay so let's put this import statement
43:58 - at the top
44:00 - let's install that package let's install
44:03 - the missing dependencies as well
44:05 - okay everything is installed now
44:11 - okay get element by image so
44:20 - okay and uh let's uh
44:33 - okay let's have an image and uh i'll go
44:36 - to
44:37 - emger and get one of my images
44:42 - so let's grab uh
44:48 - let's grab this image right here
44:52 - put that right there
44:58 - did i not close the tag
45:01 - okay so my face is now there
45:05 - and uh let's give it an id
45:09 - of image
45:14 - so i wonder if that's enough for it to
45:17 - work
45:28 - no back end found in registry
45:39 - get element by id
45:42 - let me see if i can put this image and
45:45 - actually
45:56 - find the root
46:12 - okay all right
46:17 - no back end found in registry
46:20 - let's look at this error with tensorflow
46:25 - let's see what people are saying
46:33 - okay what were the dependencies that we
46:36 - had in this project let's add those
46:38 - dependencies as well
46:42 - so whatever were the dependencies ahead
46:44 - here
46:48 - okay do i have coco ssd as a dependency
46:52 - right now in this project
46:57 - i mean i'm signed in why does it keep
46:59 - saying sign in or you'll lose progress
47:10 - what just happened
47:17 - okay
47:23 - okay dependencies i have coco ssd
47:26 - i have this what else is different
47:36 - from
47:40 - right there
47:43 - okay i have coco and i have tfjs
47:47 - we have tfjs
47:50 - i think maybe just regular tfjs as well
47:53 - tensor flow
48:00 - get the same one
48:18 - okay let's try it again
48:23 - we still get keep getting that same uh
48:29 - still keep getting that same error
48:31 - actually
48:32 - all right let's just console log uh
48:34 - something else as well let's go
48:36 - console.log
48:38 - hello all right so that hello comes
48:41 - through
48:42 - but this does not that does not come
48:46 - through
48:50 - oh wait hold on
48:55 - is it because i didn't give it
48:58 - a hashtag
49:14 - what
49:17 - okay i'll keep reading this for now and
49:19 - we might go back
49:28 - but that's all that looks like they're
49:30 - doing
49:34 - okay get element by the image
49:42 - let's check let's check that image real
49:56 - quick
49:58 - [Music]
50:03 - can take several seconds
50:08 - so yeah i don't think i need to put the
50:10 - hashtag there right
50:14 - let's hit x
50:18 - don't really need that
50:26 - after we get our prediction away let me
50:29 - try it in just vanilla
50:30 - vanilla javascript and let's
50:34 - go from there actually so let's take
50:41 - let's get out of here
50:45 - and let's try in vanilla javascript
50:52 - okay
50:59 - so there we go let's take this and add
51:01 - it right there
51:03 - let's install the package let's install
51:05 - the missing dependencies
51:08 - and uh
51:25 - instead of just starter let's actually
51:28 - make this an
51:28 - image tag i'll go image
51:34 - it's going to be a self-closing tag and
51:37 - we will go
51:38 - source is
51:44 - let's give it the image url
51:48 - let's give it an id of image
51:55 - so now
52:03 - all right so now we're getting the
52:07 - i'm getting the image
52:22 - yes i'm getting access to the image
52:24 - element so that's really really good
52:31 - but i have no idea why my coco ssd
52:34 - is not doing what it's supposed to do
52:41 - because i'm clearly getting access to
52:43 - the image
52:44 - it's right there and it's right here
52:48 - attributes right like for example i can
52:50 - do
52:53 - dot attributes
52:56 - dot id
53:02 - image
53:06 - dot attributes dot source
53:12 - attributes
53:21 - but now i want to know why am i not
53:26 - getting
53:32 - let's see if you guys have any clues in
53:35 - chat
53:37 - looking at chat now
53:42 - maybe try a different image princess
53:47 - but it's like it's not even telling me
53:49 - if there's an error or not you know
53:53 - pull the kill switch manish says
53:57 - um alok says
54:02 - const run coco async
54:08 - wait hold on is that it
54:16 - it's hard for me to actually copy your
54:18 - comment
54:22 - run coco okay so make a function
54:26 - it's an async function
54:36 - wait
54:38 - yeah this is um
54:42 - this is odd let's go
54:47 - take a look at this version
54:51 - i mean i want to just be able to do like
54:53 - a really simple version you know like i
54:55 - thought that they would have a
54:57 - simple way of doing this because i think
54:58 - the error that i'm still gonna get when
55:00 - i look at it because i have my face in
55:02 - there
55:04 - maybe let's just give it a width uh
55:07 - of 400
55:12 - like this
55:15 - and let's also give it a height of
55:20 - something like that let's give it a
55:23 - smaller height
55:32 - so when i hit inspect let's see what
55:34 - it's saying
55:36 - same thing
55:40 - there's an error that is happening in
55:42 - the
55:43 - promise okay
55:46 - so let's go through what their
55:48 - explanation is of the code
55:53 - so we after we get our prediction we
55:55 - need a way to display it on the screen
55:57 - our prediction response will be a list
55:59 - of bounding boxes
56:01 - ah b box is a bounding box
56:04 - okay okay okay okay understood
56:08 - so we have our x and y coordinate we got
56:10 - width and height okay that makes sense
56:12 - and the confidence scores class classes
56:15 - cat and scores that okay that's
56:17 - beautiful
56:20 - that's really beautiful okay
56:30 - then the canvas element actually allows
56:32 - us to
56:34 - get this let me just look up coco
56:37 - javascript load image
56:47 - load image from url because that's what
56:49 - we're doing
56:54 - what the
57:03 - what the hell
57:08 - i mean is it me or does that look like
57:10 - way more complicated than it needs to be
57:15 - coco's load image from url
57:20 - bro there's got to be an easier way why
57:23 - is this so complicated
57:26 - what why
57:38 - wow
57:43 - um
57:44 - [Music]
57:48 - okay
57:52 - how about just like a regular image
57:57 - asset loading
58:06 - geez
58:10 - geez louise
58:18 - i was wondering how i can load sprites
58:20 - from external url
58:22 - such as friends okay
58:28 - so not only are we gonna not be able to
58:31 - pull the image
58:33 - so so not only is the image gonna be
58:36 - kind of um complicated to pull
58:40 - but what makes it um harder
58:43 - is uh you're also gonna have to worry
58:46 - with
58:48 - cores
58:51 - you're gonna have to get past cores and
58:53 - to get past cores oftentimes
58:55 - you need a server side um
58:58 - that can actually bypass cores so
59:02 - course is kind of annoying to deal with
59:04 - okay you can try it like this
59:11 - so that will give you the image
59:16 - it can now work on javascript binding
59:18 - this way only works on coco to the html5
59:30 - jeez
59:32 - wow if any of you in the chat get a
59:35 - boiler boilerplate code running like
59:37 - meaning super freaking simple like
59:40 - what literally the first part of it like
59:42 - this
59:43 - that would be really cool because then i
59:44 - can copy um
59:47 - we can take a look at what you did and
59:49 - it might help everybody
59:50 - because otherwise it's like there's a
59:53 - lot of boilerplate
59:55 - and then also having to get past course
59:57 - requests it's just like really annoying
59:59 - and tedious
60:00 - and like i don't want to sit here and
60:02 - write a firebase like cloud function
60:04 - just to get past
60:04 - cores you know i want to be able to
60:06 - actually like
60:08 - you know just pick up this
60:11 - but i think even when we were going
60:13 - through the code earlier
60:15 - right close the video get element by
60:17 - video
60:18 - when we were going to the code earlier
60:20 - we were making sense of a lot of the
60:21 - things for example like the get media
60:24 - facing mode user the other one is
60:26 - environment
60:28 - so there are a lot of things that we
60:29 - picked up
60:31 - and then let's see what happens next
60:33 - okay streaming from the webcam
60:36 - to run real-time detection on a webcam
60:38 - stream
60:39 - is almost as easy as changing from an
60:41 - image tag to a video tag
60:43 - with the simple exception of this giant
60:45 - blob of code to start up the webcam
60:47 - okay
60:51 - so this is gonna be needed to start up
60:54 - the webcam
60:56 - got it
61:02 - we can then just pass our video element
61:04 - to our model for detection
61:07 - however this time we're going to call
61:09 - request animation frame
61:11 - which will call our detection function
61:13 - over and over
61:14 - in an infinite loop as fast as it can
61:17 - skipping frames when it can't
61:19 - keep up oh that's dope
61:26 - oh nice
61:34 - so we pass at the video
61:37 - element then we
61:40 - start making our predictions
61:50 - okay
61:54 - oh it's an infinite loop look at that
61:56 - call the function detect frame
62:00 - recursion baby let's go
62:03 - so this function is going to be in an
62:05 - infinite loop running forever
62:08 - and it just keeps pulling the video yeah
62:10 - that makes sense right because to stream
62:12 - video
62:13 - you need to be an infinite loop holy
62:15 -  it's crazy we're in a
62:17 - infinite loop right now you just
62:19 - watching this video
62:20 - you're in an infinite loop
62:23 - you're stuck forever you're stuck here
62:25 - with me
62:35 - wow having a lot of they have made it
62:38 - extremely easy to play with machine
62:40 - learning with minimal headache
62:42 - but it only took me hours it's beautiful
62:45 - which screen marker do you use i use
62:46 - screen brush
62:49 - that's awesome yeah i think adding my
62:51 - own models would be cool
62:53 - to this too it'd be a lot of fun so
62:56 - that was awesome all right that was
62:59 - really really fun
63:00 - i think i picked up something i hope you
63:01 - guys had fun we did some css
63:03 - stuff and then we also picked up some
63:05 - machine learning tensorflow real-time
63:07 - object detection
63:09 - with javascript that was cool i had a
63:12 - ton of fun
63:14 - um i hope you guys had a ton of fun
63:16 - hopefully you guys picked up something
