00:22 - sweet hey what's up so welcome in this
00:27 - video I want to talk about the number
00:30 - one reason why people fail to become
00:33 - developers why people fail to become
00:36 - programmers and we're gonna get into
00:41 - that but I just want to make sure that
00:44 - we welcome everyone in welcome welcome
00:46 - everyone thank you guys for jumping in
00:49 - hello dem Zee our loyal fan he was here

01:25 - cool we got eight likes
01:27 - looks kind of like a tea which is dope
01:29 - alright so and we you know who knows we
01:33 - might do some live coding as well like
01:36 - we did in the last video so we might do
01:37 - some web scraping or something fun you
01:40 - know something random let me let me give
01:44 - you guys a little let's just do
01:46 - something for fun right now actually how
01:48 - about that huh so first of all let's

04:09 - thing now that we have a lot of people
04:11 - here we're already going the momentum is
04:13 - up let's talk about what is the number
04:17 - one thing that stops you from becoming a
04:19 - developer a programmer from making that
04:22 - income that you want to make and now one
04:25 - thing is this that one thing
04:28 - is that we and you and it's kind of like
04:33 - a little reminder to myself at times and
04:35 - I tell this to myself it's like I need
04:37 - to stop being a little [ __ ] okay and
04:40 - this goes for everybody who's here for
04:47 - me it helps me to think like that okay
04:49 - because I realize that it's my own
04:51 - mental game that used to stop me all the
04:54 - time from achieving the goals that I
04:56 - wanted whether it was in programming
04:58 - lifting or running a business or running
05:02 - a team whatever it may be most people
05:05 - are too busy being little [ __ ]
05:09 - excuse my language and they just can't
05:12 - get past the first sign of failure they
05:15 - can get past you know when any obstacle
05:18 - is thrown at them or when they run into
05:20 - frustration they hit a roadblock they're
05:23 - building you know they're writing code
05:25 - for a project and all of a sudden they
05:28 - can't get past it anymore or it's a
05:30 - coding problem that they can't solve
05:31 - anymore and all they want to do is just
05:34 - give up but more than that people want
05:37 - to make excuses like I want to be a
05:40 - developer and get a job but I think I'm
05:43 - just gonna wait until my college is
05:46 - finished and then I'll be good to go or
05:48 - I want to wait until I finish this one
05:52 - class or tutorial till I want to do this
05:57 - one thing okay so let me yeah so let me
06:08 - make make that clear okay so let's let
06:12 - me share this with you guys here real
06:14 - quick where is this do I need to add
06:19 - this to the top layer will it show now
06:26 - okay like that maybe that's better all
06:30 - right so you guys can see this comment
06:33 - and the comment is the following let me
06:36 - make this a little bit bigger so you
06:37 - guys can focus on it easier so the
06:40 - comment is this
06:42 - this guy commented on one of my videos
06:45 - that's called why most programmers are
06:47 - broke alright and he says let's make it
06:50 - even bigger so it's even easier boom on
06:53 - the money I waited 10 years of wanting
06:57 - to code quit my structural structural
07:00 - engineering job after having a heart
07:03 - attack at 25 started my own business
07:07 - subcontracting engineering and build my
07:10 - own website learning HTML CSS JavaScript
07:14 - and PHP along the way a few months later
07:18 - I started writing WP plugins then
07:23 - learned to program
07:24 - apps in laravel continuing the journey
07:30 - and the plan I had 10 years earlier to
07:33 - program hardware like microcontrollers
07:35 - now I am building my own libraries and
07:38 - hardware for smart homes and should have
07:41 - a product to market this year all while
07:44 - supporting a family and doing
07:46 - contracting to keep money in the bank
07:49 - anything is possible if you take action
07:52 - and make it happen no University no
07:56 - graduating high school no waiting
07:59 - David Knowles 42 minutes ago on a
08:03 - YouTube video ok now with that said I
08:09 - will hoppity-hop let me actually do this
08:14 - let me move can I move this one down
08:17 - down to this level and then this one
08:22 - down to this level sorry guys it's uh
08:25 - I'm like adjusting some stuff on the fly
08:27 - so just learning how a lot of these
08:29 - tools
08:37 - you
09:22 - sorry I think my mic was off and wasn't
09:26 - working so I'm just gonna say that part
09:28 - again but okay if we're looking at this
09:32 - this man had a heart attack
09:37 - he had no degree he did not graduate
09:41 - from high school and he goes on to start
09:44 - his own business hire contractors and
09:48 - gets a high paying job all while
09:51 - supporting his family and keeping money
09:53 - in the bank now if that to you is not
09:55 - powerful I don't know what is and this
10:01 - is some this is a common problem that I
10:03 - see with people all the freaking time
10:05 - where they're like oh I didn't graduate
10:08 - or I didn't do this or I need to make
10:11 - sure I do this that or the other thing
10:13 - before I can even start to think about
10:16 - getting a job before I can even start to
10:18 - think about doing something and it's
10:19 - like at the end of the day you're just
10:22 - being a little [ __ ] you are just making
10:26 - an excuse it's a form of procrastination
10:30 - you are saying that you're waiting until
10:33 - you finish something to start something
10:36 - and it's not true you don't actually
10:39 - need to wait for anything right and this
10:42 - man is a really powerful example of that
10:45 - so now I'm gonna hide that comment and
10:47 - go like this okay
10:52 - so what first of all are we still having
11:01 - audio issues guys what's going on audio
11:04 - issues is audio fine okay
11:17 - sorry about the no audio guys should be
11:20 - back now alright so this is the thing
11:24 - that's so important and we overlooked it
11:27 - all the time the amount of grit that it
11:29 - takes the amount of resilience that it
11:31 - takes for you to actually become good at
11:35 - a thing and you go through a lot of
11:36 - failures and this man went through an
11:41 - insane amount of failures and then this
11:43 - man went on to crush it and succeed and
11:47 - if this guy can do it with all these
11:50 - drawbacks
11:52 - then what stops you from being able to
11:56 - achieve the very same goals also in his
12:00 - comment if I bring that up again I want
12:05 - you to notice okay I want you to notice
12:10 - let's go I'm trying to adjust this at
12:14 - the same time okay let's do that
12:20 - zoom in now he learned HTML CSS
12:25 - JavaScript in PHP along the way meaning
12:28 - he actually did it completely by himself
12:31 - he did not rely on let's say an external
12:35 - resource to provide that now I'm not
12:37 - saying you shouldn't leverage college
12:41 - but college or some kind of degree or
12:44 - some kind of course don't hide behind it
12:47 - and don't make it your everything it
12:50 - should just be one extra resource so
12:53 - this person was still learning even
12:55 - though he didn't even go to high school
12:57 - right it doesn't mean your learning
12:58 - stops I never encouraged you to not
13:00 - learn you shouldn't be learning for the
13:01 - rest of your life but you need to
13:04 - leverage being able to learn on your own
13:08 - and becoming you know learning the
13:10 - practical skills because those are the
13:12 - skills that will land you a job and keep
13:14 - you at it but if you don't have that
13:16 - level of grit you will fail and you will
13:19 - not become a programmer I mean it's just
13:22 - that's just facts because this
13:24 - programming is a very very hard
13:27 - skill and because it's a very hard skill
13:31 - that is precisely why people get paid so
13:37 - much for it okay
13:39 - because you're the amount of money that
13:49 - you get paid right
13:51 - who says Bob Proctor says this the
13:54 - amount of money you get paid is directly
13:55 - proportional to the demand for what it
14:03 - is that you do okay I think the second
14:09 - thing is how skilled you are at it and
14:13 - then I believe the third thing is how
14:16 - difficult is it to replace you if it's
14:21 - very difficult to replace you that is
14:27 - how much if if it's very difficult to
14:29 - replace you in a job where there is a
14:33 - lot of demand then by definition you are
14:37 - going to be making a lot of money your
14:39 - income is going to be proportional to
14:41 - that programming is going to be it's not
14:49 - going away all right it's only becoming
14:53 - more and more everything is becoming
14:54 - automated cars are becoming automated
14:59 - cameras are automated we have lights
15:03 - that are automated
15:05 - we have apps that you know we use every
15:08 - single day like Instagram YouTube so
15:10 - everything is moving towards that and
15:13 - has been so programming is now going to
15:15 - be going away anytime soon and if it's a
15:18 - skill set you can develop and you can
15:20 - become just brutally good at it it's
15:24 - gonna become really hard to replace you
15:26 - and when it comes really hard to replace
15:27 - you in a skill that there's a huge
15:29 - demand for your income is going to be
15:33 - proportional to that so as long as you
15:37 - keep that in mind and you understand
15:39 - what the big goal is
15:41 - then you need to understand that there's
15:42 - gonna be a lot of difficulties coming
15:44 - your way it's gonna be a painful journey
15:47 - you're gonna feel frustrated so many
15:50 - times you're gonna feel just frustrated
15:53 - and wanting to not move forward because
15:55 - that's what programming will do to you
15:57 - where you're coding something and you're
15:59 - working on things and it just seems like
16:00 - there's no forward made forward way to
16:04 - make progress and sometimes it can feel
16:06 - like it's dry and it's boring but you
16:11 - have to always go back to your number
16:13 - one goal of why you even started this
16:15 - while you're doing this it needs to
16:17 - remind yourself of that and then with
16:19 - that you want to keep moving forward
16:21 - I mean honestly for me it's one of the
16:25 - most fun things where I feel that you
16:28 - it's it shouldn't even be allowed it
16:30 - should be illegal for you to get paid to
16:31 - code because of how fun it is like it
16:33 - shouldn't be allowed but yet people pay
16:36 - you to code so I mean it's just such an
16:41 - amazing opportunity because I grew up
16:43 - playing video games this is a video game
16:48 - do you write stuff and stuff gets
16:51 - created in real life like you can make
16:53 - real world applications on the fly that
16:59 - is and then you can just share them with
17:05 - people okay
17:15 - I'm just sorry I'm just reading the
17:18 - comments so if you have such an amazing
17:23 - opportunity and it's almost like a video
17:25 - game and you get paid for it take like
17:28 - it's like take advantage of it you know
17:31 - and there's so much demand take
17:33 - advantage of it and you could work as a
17:34 - remote developer you could travel and do
17:37 - this and what I find really cool about
17:39 - it is that it can turn into just a
17:42 - full-on lifestyle for you I don't know
17:44 - how to solve this thing by the way I'm
17:45 - just holding this to make myself look
17:47 - smart it's like it could just be a
17:50 - lifestyle where you could still have
17:55 - your own life to do whatever you want
17:57 - because I always wanted to travel the
17:59 - world and I wanted to go to super cool
18:04 - spots and I wanted to be able to spend
18:05 - time with my family and I wanted to be
18:07 - able to have freedom to kind of do
18:10 - whatever I want so you know I'm from
18:13 - Chicago but now I live in Hollywood and
18:19 - it's a pretty dope spot and I love being
18:22 - able to just pick up my [ __ ] and travel
18:24 - at any time that I want and so for you
18:29 - you know it just depends what kind of
18:31 - lifestyle you want I wanted to look I
18:33 - wanted to be able to do a skill where I
18:35 - was so good at it that I didn't have
18:36 - somebody always watching over my back
18:40 - you know and always looking over what
18:46 - I'm doing all the time I wanted to be
18:47 - able to have my own autonomy I wanted to
18:51 - be respected and appreciated for what I
18:53 - do and when you're writing code like
18:59 - especially when you're freelancing like
19:01 - your clients don't know what the [ __ ]
19:02 - you're doing
19:03 - so they actually just give you massive
19:05 - amounts of respect they're just like
19:06 - you just handle the business you just do
19:09 - this we'll just pay you and you tell us
19:11 - what we can do to make you happy because
19:14 - they don't want to be on your bad side
19:16 - either so it was I thought Matt I always
19:19 - feel massively respected when I go in
19:22 - anywhere I almost feel like I'm being
19:25 - respected like a doctor
19:27 - and then on top of that I choose my own
19:32 - hours which is what I want to do cuz you
19:38 - know I wonder I always wanted to be able
19:40 - to choose my own hours so then I can do
19:43 - kind of whatever I want like the idea of
19:46 - going somewhere consistently but like I
19:51 - said a specific time and getting out at
19:53 - a specific time feels like prison to me
19:56 - you know it's like [ __ ] prison it's
20:01 - literally the worst thing I could think
20:02 - of like if I had to do a nine-to-five
20:05 - job I would probably just shoot myself
20:10 - alright so yeah I just wouldn't do it
20:12 - I never have I never will
20:17 - it's not because I'm afraid of work
20:19 - because most days I'm working over 10
20:22 - hours 15 hours a day so it has nothing
20:27 - new of the work I [ __ ] love work but
20:29 - it's just that meant it puts me just in
20:32 - a mental prison when I have to just show
20:34 - up somewhere at a specific time get out
20:36 - at a specific time just do a specific
20:39 - thing it makes me go crazy and I love
20:41 - how there was there were two dislikes
20:43 - and then it went from two to one and
20:45 - then that person I think liked so that
20:47 - was pretty cool thank you for that by
20:48 - the way I appreciate it yeah so the
20:52 - micromanaging is really just [ __ ]
20:54 - right like the golden honey says in the
20:57 - chat it's not fun and I just have too
21:02 - much I don't know if you want to say ego
21:04 - or whatever you want to call it but I
21:07 - just want to be able to do the thing and
21:11 - be good at it and just have people
21:14 - leaving the [ __ ] alone when I'm in my
21:15 - zone of genius create something and then
21:17 - give it to you
21:18 - right and that's what programming allows
21:21 - me to be able to do so I find that super
21:25 - cool all right I'm looking at some
21:30 - questions here as well and comments
21:34 - somebody says facts big facts
21:41 - YouTube Plus Stack Overflow is equal to
21:44 - divine discourse who says yes that is
21:47 - true what do you think about Scala okay
21:56 - give me one second guys
21:58 - I think Aaron is here okay goes you
22:26 - switch the nine to five and I'll shoot
22:28 - myself
22:33 - okay
22:37 - so this one guy says hey guys Aaron is
22:40 - here welcome Aaron we're just chillin
22:46 - we might code up something who knows
22:48 - dude I discovered some really cool stuff
22:50 - like you can pop in a you can pop in a
22:54 - comment and then if I hit live it like
22:55 - will show up on their side and then I
23:00 - can't even like make it small and do
23:03 - whatever I want
23:05 - that's pretty dope huh yeah by the way
23:09 - guys iron is our new instructor because
23:13 - a era gone over Aaron is our brand new
23:21 - addition to clever programmer and wait
23:25 - sounds are gone why are people lying
23:29 - like that sounds were right here so he
23:32 - is he's a developer he's really badass
23:35 - he's probably he's actually probably
23:36 - more skilled than I am at programming
23:38 - but in just different things like he's a
23:41 - real software developer you know I'm
23:43 - more of like builds real [ __ ] and go get
23:47 - jobs Yeah right
23:50 - he's more of the blood-spot says the joy
23:59 - when you read my comment was kidding by
24:01 - the way oh yes yes sound is good yes
24:06 - sound is fine yeah there we go Sam says
24:08 - they line thank you all right I love
24:12 - that we have some moderators you know
24:14 - that we can trust yeah yeah all right so
24:19 - this is why you know I was just telling
24:21 - them why the number what's the number
24:23 - one reason do you know what's the number
24:24 - one reason why most people fail to
24:26 - become a programmer or fail as
24:28 - programmers to get jobs it's kind of a
24:33 - trick question
24:34 - yes so you said lot he said lack of
24:37 - experience I said being a little [ __ ]
24:43 - [Laughter]
24:47 - yep so they heard my answer he goes
24:50 - Aaron in his favorite chair I work 70
24:56 - hours plus a week at a job I hate and
24:58 - still find the time to learn to program
24:59 - so here's another concept of not every
25:02 - dollar is equal so I'm gonna take this
25:04 - comment and give me one second I'll do
25:12 - some magic here real quick
25:17 - wait we need like a full-time person who
25:24 - edits this stuff on the fly that'd be so
25:26 - dope I'll pay some good amount of money
25:33 - for that
25:36 - alright so hide your face alright so
25:40 - this is the comment we got very just
25:42 - right now which mr. snow wolf said this
25:45 - and he goes I work 70 plus hours a week
25:48 - at a job and I still find time to learn
25:51 - to program so first of all I just want
25:53 - to give mr. snow wolf no slaps on class
26:08 - so so absolutely love what snow wolf
26:14 - says and so first of all that's great
26:18 - but the second thing I want to mention
26:19 - here what's not great about this is if
26:22 - you find yourself in this position try
26:24 - to get yourself out of this position as
26:26 - fast as [ __ ] possible because not
26:31 - every dollar is equal all right so this
26:34 - is a concept I recently talked about and
26:37 - what that basically means is let's say I
26:39 - made $10 from uber let's say my goal is
26:43 - to become a developer and I'm gonna ask
26:46 - you guys this question I'm gonna need an
26:48 - answer from you in the chat before I
26:49 - continue forward I'm not gonna continue
26:50 - until I get answers for this so let's
26:53 - say I when I make so I want to become a
26:55 - professor
26:56 - developer my dream and goal is I want to
26:58 - work for a company like Google or I want
27:00 - to start my own startup and have and
27:03 - hire their developers and that's my
27:05 - dream is it better for me to earn ten
27:09 - dollars from uber or is it better for me
27:11 - to earn ten dollars from programming
27:14 - okay which is the better option
27:17 - uber or programming so drop that in the
27:21 - chat and I'll take a look at it this is
27:27 - what's this is what happens a lot of the
27:29 - times people want to get a particular
27:33 - job just so they can they always say
27:37 - this I just want to be able to support
27:39 - myself I just want to be able to survive
27:42 - well here's the thing that happens my
27:44 - friend you do that thing for 70 hours a
27:48 - week 70 hours a week what's total amount
27:50 - of hours in a week hundred and sixty
27:52 - eight twenty four times seven right
27:56 - there 168 total hours in a week and if
28:02 - you spend 70 hours a week and these are
28:07 - probably the 70 most effective hours
28:09 - right because most of the times you're
28:11 - doing a job in the morning till like
28:13 - you're starting your day off by doing
28:15 - work right so when you're doing
28:17 - something for 70 hours when you're doing
28:21 - a job you're essentially spending your
28:22 - most effective and alert hours there
28:26 - right and then the remainder is just
28:32 - like like whatever random time right so
28:35 - that time you have to spend some of it
28:37 - obviously with your friends and family
28:38 - so you you don't get divorced and your
28:41 - friends don't leave you and then you
28:43 - look like a loser so you have to spend
28:44 - some time there and then you what's
28:47 - remaining you have a few tired exhausted
28:50 - hours remaining to then learn something
28:53 - new right which there's nothing wrong
28:57 - with you can still do it but now think
28:59 - about this
29:00 - you spend your waking best most powerful
29:05 - hours
29:07 - doing something you [ __ ] hate how
29:12 - would that make you feel learn yeah so
29:25 - that would not feel really good you'd
29:28 - probably need to take Advil a lot of the
29:32 - times and then let's talk about what
29:35 - happens right so you're spending seventy
29:37 - hours on something you hate and your
29:41 - most effective hours of every week what
29:43 - ends up happening is that your
29:44 - thermostat of life starts to go down as
29:47 - well okay so we're talking about your
29:50 - joy starts to go down your level of
29:54 - creativity starts to go down your level
29:56 - of inspiration motivation ambition and
30:01 - your ability to actually want to achieve
30:05 - more you start to also compromise so
30:08 - have you ever found yourself like think
30:10 - back to when you were younger and you
30:12 - might have had some insane goals I
30:14 - wanted to be a soccer player okay then
30:18 - as I grew older I'm like no that's
30:20 - that's really not gonna happen that's
30:22 - the unrealistic goal then I had some
30:24 - other big goals and I would keep
30:26 - bringing them down when you are doing
30:28 - that you're also bringing your levels of
30:31 - goals down coming from that place to
30:38 - learn programming is a difficult thing
30:43 - if you can do it [ __ ] fantastic hats
30:48 - off to you that's why I don't even have
30:49 - a hat on because I took it off you know
30:52 - in prediction of this comment so as
30:54 - that's [ __ ] great if you can do that
30:56 - well most of the times this is why when
30:59 - people get into problems and they're run
31:01 - into a coding problem they quit right
31:05 - away or after they get frustrated for a
31:07 - few hours I mean how much more
31:09 - frustration can you bear if you're doing
31:11 - something for 70 hours of your most
31:13 - effective hours probably not that much
31:15 - more frustration right so then you run
31:18 - into a coding problem that gives you
31:19 - that makes you more
31:21 - frustrated okay look [ __ ] this I'm out
31:24 - right
31:25 - whereas if you can figure out a way to
31:29 - do it where now imagine these seventy
31:32 - hours were replaced by 20 hours of
31:36 - coding and I don't know what mr. snow
31:39 - wolf is being paid but I know most
31:41 - people are being paid ten to fifteen
31:42 - dollars an hour or less who are here on
31:45 - this livestream but you know I don't
31:47 - know maybe you could be making a [ __ ]
31:49 - ton of money some of the people that
31:50 - clever programmer you know are making
31:52 - 400 euro four hundred grand a year or
31:56 - millions of dollars a year and they have
31:59 - businesses but I know most of the people
32:01 - are not at that level so if you are
32:05 - making 10 to $15 an hour and you are
32:13 - doing some random tasks that has no
32:15 - alignment with your goal and then it's
32:17 - crushing so many of your other things
32:20 - gonna be really hard to move forward in
32:23 - the direction of your goal however if
32:25 - you replace it with coding in an
32:27 - intelligent way where you start charging
32:32 - another person as you're learning you
32:34 - find other people you can coach or train
32:36 - in coding they might pay you 30 40 50
32:40 - dollars an hour we have a few students
32:43 - in a profitable shortcut program which
32:46 - is my group coaching program where I've
32:48 - actually worked with you in a group
32:49 - setting and they have already landed
32:52 - clients for $50 an hour $60 an hour or
32:55 - more and now they can replace a lot of
32:58 - the like okay let's do some math here if
33:02 - you're making $10 an hour and you jump
33:05 - to making $50 an hour how many at the
33:09 - $10 an hour job how many more hours how
33:13 - many hours you need to work to make it
33:15 - equal to your $50 an hour job does that
33:17 - question make sense okay
33:21 - so if you're at a $10 an hour job how
33:26 - many hours you need to work to make it
33:27 - equal to your $50 an hour job five times
33:30 - as much
33:32 - which means that if you had one lifetime
33:37 - if you did one lifetime of work at the
33:41 - $10 an hour job how many lifetimes would
33:47 - you have to spend to make it equal to
33:48 - your $50 an hour job you would have to
33:53 - have a great great great great
33:54 - grandchildren and you would have to
33:56 - spend five lifetimes
33:57 - yeah correct right I mean I would just
34:02 - have grandchildren and then make them my
34:04 - employees and then it would just be this
34:06 - great big business but no farm so you
34:11 - would have to spend five lifetimes so
34:13 - you have to look at it in terms of that
34:15 - don't just look at it was just temporary
34:17 - I'm just maybe $10 an hour here like no
34:19 - if it's not in line with your goals I
34:21 - would rather make no money and learn and
34:25 - and do an internship somewhere where I
34:27 - am coding but it's in line with my dream
34:31 - of becoming a developer then make $15 or
34:33 - $20 an hour because it's just not worth
34:37 - it right in the long run it's gonna be a
34:39 - way to lose now I know there's
34:41 - practicality issues right you have you
34:43 - might have family to support you might
34:47 - have to support yourself you have bills
34:49 - to pay I get you which is why I suggest
34:52 - figure out intelligent ways work more up
34:56 - here
34:56 - okay figure out intelligent ways on how
35:00 - you can start replacing that income from
35:02 - coding as you're learning coding so then
35:06 - you don't have to spend 70 hours a week
35:08 - doing something completely different
35:09 - that you hate you can start to spend 20
35:12 - 30 40 50 hours coding and maybe even
35:15 - getting paid for it and then the
35:18 - remainder of the time also spending
35:20 - coding and now you're gonna be getting
35:23 - to the place where you want to get to at
35:25 - a much much much faster pace so that and
35:30 - with that said mr. snow wolf this is not
35:34 - to pick on you or anything this is a
35:36 - great comment and your life to be
35:39 - totally different and I could have just
35:40 - made all of this up and I probably did
35:43 - but it's just this is something that
35:45 - just
35:46 - happens with people sometimes and in
35:48 - their case it might be a lot worse
35:51 - you know then what's happening to you so
35:52 - I'm just kind of emphasizing points and
35:54 - making them a lot stronger and maybe
35:56 - even harsher so it gets the point across
35:59 - to people who are really young and just
36:02 - want to make sure that they stay on the
36:04 - right path so I'm gonna clear that up
36:05 - right there all right let's see what's
36:12 - going on 141 people that's awesome I
36:16 - love that great okay so people are
36:21 - saying like imposter syndrome work
36:23 - harder not smarter I just hired myself a
36:26 - clever program programming yes but do
36:33 - over on the weekends charge more money
36:35 - sure if you're gonna do a BER then be
36:38 - listening to books or something like do
36:40 - something that's more in line with your
36:42 - lifelong goals okay yeah closer not I
36:58 - was like fifty shades of gray or
36:59 - anything well like listen to like books
37:01 - that'll actually achieve help you
37:02 - achieve what you want to what you want
37:04 - to achieve in life like south of books
37:06 - business books coding books yeah
37:08 - anything like that yes yes grind us all
37:16 - inside our cell and make programming
37:17 - your full revenue stream Sam says is
37:20 - great I would also say intelligent
37:23 - hustle pleased its overlooked and it's
37:26 - the ultimate form of laziness so I had
37:29 - this quote by let me see if I can pull
37:33 - this up I had this quote by Tim Ferriss
37:38 - is fantastic and I'm gonna pop that up
37:40 - on the screen here and it's just it's
37:42 - [ __ ] life-changing like really let
37:44 - this one sink in really pay attention to
37:46 - this because this is super powerful
37:55 - but first I have to obviously find it
38:04 - okay there we go
38:08 - mana gotta do all this [ __ ] on the fly
38:16 - but I'm getting faster at it that's good
38:22 - okay so here is the quote and it goes in
38:35 - discriminant action is reflective of too
38:39 - little thinking and planning and that is
38:43 - lazy it is one of the most destructive
38:47 - forms of laziness because it is socially
38:50 - reinforced and people will encourage you
38:53 - to do that in other words they will say
38:56 - don't just stand there do something if
38:59 - you're constantly doing things that are
39:01 - not carefully thought through you will
39:03 - end up doing the opposite of the 80/20
39:05 - principle you will end up specializing
39:08 - in unimportant things you will become an
39:11 - expert in doing the things that are
39:14 - trivial well that is a travesty and it's
39:17 - a huge waste of life or a card but only
39:21 - when it is applied to the right things
39:23 - everything with measurement and
39:25 - objective Tim Ferriss so what does all
39:35 - this mean it simply means the following
39:39 - hustling without being effective is a
39:43 - fall is the worst form of laziness it's
39:47 - a pretty destructive form of laziness so
39:50 - you want to let me edit that out of the
39:56 - screen so basically you want to get to
39:59 - the point where you are hustling but
40:03 - super effectively that's why you want to
40:05 - always
40:06 - planning and changing your plans and
40:08 - then working all right
40:13 - coding pads approximately eight out of
40:15 - ten actually or four out of five four
40:17 - dollars learning your goals skill is
40:19 - worth more than five dollars in which
40:20 - you hate ice I don't really agree with
40:25 - that coding pads I would say that one
40:32 - dollar or even twenty five cents of
40:36 - learning your goal skill is worth more
40:38 - than five dollars doing what you hate I
40:39 - would go as far as that the difference
40:41 - is huge
40:44 - if you think that the ratio is four
40:48 - dollars of learning your goal skill is
40:50 - equal to like five dollars of doing what
40:53 - you hate your [ __ ] gonna you're just
40:56 - on the wrong path that's [ __ ] that's
40:58 - unbelievable like I cannot agree with
41:00 - that it's wrong yeah it's just wrong
41:06 - like um basically what sometimes we end
41:10 - up focusing on is a short-term goal but
41:13 - not necessarily the long-term goal so if
41:16 - you're thinking about the long-term goal
41:17 - you are gonna lose really hard with that
41:21 - comparison but you will win if you're
41:23 - thinking 25 cents to five dollars all
41:28 - right
41:33 - [Music]
41:39 - Christopher Johnson says who cares about
41:41 - money just enjoy coding absolutely wrong
41:44 - why don't you just then go play video
41:47 - games but you have to understand that we
41:49 - live in a Western world
41:51 - Western civilization and money is how
41:54 - the world runs and to make impact impact
41:58 - oftentimes requires money you want him
42:02 - and I'm not just talking about
42:03 - motivational impact right I'm talking
42:05 - about like something happens to your
42:08 - father he gets into a car accident and
42:10 - there's a brutal situation and now the
42:12 - hospital doctors require $90,000 surgery
42:16 - do you have the [ __ ] money to pay for
42:18 - that or not because you can't motivate
42:20 - him out of you know life-and-death
42:23 - situation so you do have to understand
42:25 - that money is very important but with
42:30 - that said also have fun okay mr. snow
42:33 - wolf says I'm gone most of the week - I
42:35 - am - fix that okay great
42:37 - shout out ahead Ville yep yep yep
42:47 - okay let's go Oliver O'Brien says I'm on
42:57 - 130 K okay great I'm just going through
43:07 - the comments trying to find some great
43:09 - comments you should jump on the comments
43:13 - - maybe you can help me find them faster
43:17 - David Rivera says this is true a tried
43:19 - learning Java with Udacity for nine
43:21 - months and was basically forcing myself
43:23 - to do so after my full time job and it
43:26 - sucked I couldn't finish my projects in
43:28 - time yeah because then you have just so
43:31 - limited time you just you can barely
43:33 - even finish your projects at the end
43:35 - you're gonna hate coding but it happened
43:39 - because of the other thing so you have
43:41 - to fix the main problem and it's root
43:56 - okay
44:00 - I am complete Christopher Johnson says
44:03 - I'm completely new to coding I find it
44:05 - fun and I want to learn artificial
44:07 - intelligence should I jump to learning
44:09 - AI or do I need prerequisites you can
44:12 - jump to learning at my friend there are
44:14 - prerequisites that are gonna come along
44:15 - the way but just learn them as you go
44:17 - and I would say find somebody who knows
44:19 - about AI and you can find them in the
44:21 - online world you could go to channels
44:24 - and find somebody who can help you you
44:26 - can go to a physical location like
44:28 - meetups and find somebody but I would
44:30 - say find somebody and then learn from
44:32 - them but then also don't be lazy in the
44:34 - mean time still keep doing it and don't
44:36 - be like I'm not gonna start learning
44:38 - until I find somebody
44:52 - okay let's see
45:09 - it's Dempsey says we need money to live
45:11 - in this cruel world it's not a cruel
45:13 - world at all I mean it depends what side
45:17 - you look at it from but objectively
45:19 - speaking there's no such thing as good
45:21 - or bad they're just things just are so
45:25 - you know don't have a victim mentality
45:27 - there look it's a cruel cruel world just
45:33 - roll with it
45:39 - golden honey says honestly I worked 80
45:43 - to 90 day 90 hour hold on I work it's
45:49 - okay I work 80 to 90 hours a week with
45:53 - three days off I get up early exercise
45:56 - then program for about two hours before
45:58 - I start my shift and on my off days I
46:01 - work on my programming
46:05 - that's pretty good but that's also
46:08 - really tough right because you have 80
46:11 - to 90 hours of work three days off and
46:14 - then yeah but hey if you're working on
46:19 - programming that's really good you know
46:21 - you're spending your weekends there was
46:22 - just really good so that's more good job
46:29 - meetups are really good Aaron says make
46:33 - me a moderator all right Aaron here you
46:37 - go
46:37 - Aaron is now moderator we put a like
46:41 - Aaron he hates the new column he says
46:49 - cause you should make a music video I've
46:50 - thought about it
46:52 - we made this rap song a while ago and
46:55 - put it on Instagram let me if you guys
47:00 - want it if you guys want to hear it let
47:02 - me know you say something like I want to
47:03 - hear the rap song I'll put it on but
47:06 - yeah we made something and then we were
47:08 - thinking to actually hire a few models
47:11 - rent a Lamborghini and
47:13 - we were gonna actually shoot a music
47:15 - video we were so well we still could
47:17 - depending on how much if people really
47:19 - want us to do one we might just do it
47:22 - might be fun let's see this isn't one
47:26 - here
47:28 - yeah it's that one it's pretty lit
47:30 - actually to it oh how many people
47:39 - oh by the way guys yeah we do have 153
47:43 - so far that's pretty cool so yeah I do
47:45 - want to mention this thank you for
47:48 - reminding me Aaron's alright so here's
47:58 - the training it the link is in the
48:00 - description below this is my six step
48:02 - system to becoming a Python freelancer
48:05 - I'm running this training this is gonna
48:08 - be really epic training I'm running it
48:10 - in March on March 22nd which is two days
48:13 - from now
48:14 - at 12 p.m. Pacific so it's a Friday
48:16 - you're gonna go here and then click Save
48:19 - my spot pop in your email and then you
48:25 - will you know you'll basically enroll in
48:27 - this training alright otherwise there's
48:30 - no other way to enroll in this training
48:31 - I'm not doing it on YouTube it is
48:33 - exclusive but I will be doing it for
48:36 - that you're not gonna be paying for it
48:39 - okay it's gonna be a free epic just
48:41 - massive amounts of value so we're gonna
48:43 - be spending a lot of time putting this
48:45 - training together for you guys and
48:46 - making it as valuable as possible yep
48:50 - like these live streams are more just
48:53 - casual you know I jump on and we just
48:55 - talk and maybe I answer your questions
48:58 - maybe I code and we just kind of have
49:00 - fun that training is just very specific
49:05 - like you know it's very goal-oriented
49:07 - and focus because I know nobody's there
49:09 - to [ __ ] around
49:10 - people want serious information whereas
49:12 - on live stream sometimes people are more
49:14 - in a fun mood and just want to hang out
49:16 - and not gonna do something too serious
49:18 - so yeah go sign up and that'd be super
49:21 - dope to see you in there
49:31 - [Laughter]
49:33 - nine people live hello world huh I
49:39 - wasn't gonna say that and then all of a
49:41 - sudden just came out of nowhere I just
49:43 - said hello world in there
49:47 - apparently YouTube allows you to now do
49:49 - stream like right from here it's crazier
49:52 - it's like it tells you concurrent
49:55 - viewers chat rate everything and then
49:57 - you can even do it right from YouTube so
50:00 - wouldn't that be just so much easier we
50:02 - don't even need to use any tools yeah
50:09 - probably not who knows we have a hundred
50:13 - and fifty eight people registered that's
50:15 - great
50:15 - should we max it out at like 200 or no
50:20 - the training just cuz I feel like
50:28 - sometimes it gets too many people in
50:30 - there cuz then sometimes just ready to
50:41 - get so many messages on the side that
50:42 - people can't then they're like they
50:44 - can't pay attention like we've had we've
50:47 - had like - we've had like sometimes lots
50:53 - of people register and then it's like
50:55 - crazy
50:59 - Lucas goes hi hi Lucas I'm like
51:08 - messaging them in there but yeah I'll
51:11 - talk with Rachel as well let's do that's
51:14 - yeah Dempsey says hundred to two people
51:16 - that is a lot actually that is really
51:17 - cool

54:23 - have an idea of another promising myself
54:26 - that I'll come back to it but never do
54:29 - this is a very common problem and it
54:33 - happens all the time
54:34 - and if you notice this happening with
54:36 - you quite a bit then just
54:49 - sometimes it's okay I'm sorry all right
55:14 - so if you find yourself that happening
55:17 - it's not so bad I do that too with
55:20 - projects I got what I want and then I'll
55:23 - move on but if you really want to finish
55:25 - one and you constantly keep finding this
55:28 - happening then just know that you do
55:30 - that and just don't do it anymore just
55:31 - stick to one [ __ ] project all the way
55:35 - until you kind of you know quote-unquote

67:45 - get headsets in to you so you can listen
67:47 - to it with one ear like put it in one

68:02 - right I'll delete this file so we can do
68:04 - this again because this is pretty fun so
68:06 - yesterday we coded up this app on a live
68:11 - stream which was super dope it was a web
68:13 - scraping app for eBay deals and if I go
68:17 - on this deals page if I go eBay comm and
68:21 - click deals what this does is it goes
68:24 - and finds the feature deals and then
68:27 - writes them out to a CSV file in excel
68:29 - file so it scrapes the web for the best
68:33 - deals on eBay and then writes them to an
68:35 - excel file and you could put this you
68:38 - could make this script and have the
68:39 - script do this for you so this was the
68:43 - script we wrote now it should get these
68:47 - things right like free certified
68:49 - preowned ZTE or Michael Kors or the
68:53 - Crocs Swifter or Skagen or
68:56 - Canon EOS for $699 and it should get
68:59 - these prices not to strike through
69:01 - pricing here I should get to $6.99
69:03 - $69.99 let's check it out and see if the
69:06 - script works I'm gonna hit run here and
69:08 - you shouldn't get today's deals let's
69:11 - check it out
69:12 - all right and we wrote this file out to
69:15 - eBay deals March 20th that's CSV so
69:18 - let's go there and click boom looks like
69:21 - it's there which is super dope and what
69:24 - we're gonna do is now download this as a
69:27 - zip file I'm gonna click into it and
69:29 - then I will click here and let's check
69:33 - it out so boom we see free certified
