08:51 - corner a collie cartel is gonna kill you
08:54 - Pablo Escobar's men are gonna come out
08:56 - of somewhere and we definitely didn't
08:58 - even see anybody dealing with drugs this
09:01 - was what we saw was an amazing place all

09:05 - stereotypes was a beautiful place with
09:07 - loving people
09:08 - incredible coffee I'm gonna miss their
09:11 - coffee

09:45 - Colombia Marion and check it out for
09:47 - yourself and I just urge you to travel
09:49 - and explore your possibilities because
09:51 - look when you look around the world is a
09:53 - huge place and just being trapped in
09:55 - Europe in a little land you don't want
09:58 - to be part of that statistic where you
10:00 - live and die within a you know 300 mile
10:04 - radius of where you were born so don't
10:07 - be a statistic go out and explore more
10:09 - and like one of the most hated youtubers
10:13 - currently says life's not short you just
10:17 - got to do more I agree with them his
10:20 - name is Logan Paul so do more and enjoy
10:22 - your life
