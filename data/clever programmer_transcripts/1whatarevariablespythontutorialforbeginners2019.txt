00:00 - - Hey you, what is up?
00:02 - This is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com.
00:04 - In this Python tutorial
for absolute beginners
00:08 - we are gonna cover everything from A to Z,
00:10 - step by step, and I'll also even show you
00:14 - some tips and tricks
to become a freelancer.
00:18 - And I also have a special gift for you
00:19 - at the end of this video.
00:20 - (calm electronic music)
00:25 - We're gonna start with very simple basics,
00:28 - which is what the hell
are variables in Python?
00:32 - So let's get started.
00:33 - Now, in terms of installing Python,
00:36 - there's something easier for
you that I have and recommend.
00:38 - If you wanna install Python
locally on your computer
00:40 - and you're crazy about that,
this is the video to watch,
00:43 - but you don't need install Python.
00:44 - You can actually get started without it.
00:46 - So go to repl dot I-T, R-E-P-L dot I-T.
00:49 - I've also put this in the links
below where you can click.
00:53 - I'm gonna give you access to
all of my code as I code it
00:57 - and you can then go and make
changes to it, whatever,
00:58 - so go to repl.it, you're gonna type,
01:00 - go here, type in "turtle" and
then when you click on that
01:05 - we're gonna start coding, okay?
01:06 - So now basically what's going
on is you have Python open,
01:10 - and we're going to talk
about what variables are.
01:11 - Okay, so variables are very simple.
01:13 - I can say A is equal to five,
and then if I do print(a),
01:18 - print just means show,
and if I run this thing,
01:21 - it's gonna show me, in the
console, it just says five, okay?
01:25 - That's all that it is.
01:26 - Now if I do B is equal to
some string, like this,
01:30 - anything that's within quotes
is just called a string,
01:33 - okay, it's just a fancy way
of saying quote, alright.
01:36 - And now, if I do print(b) and
I hit run, what do you get?
01:41 - You get "hello".
01:42 - So on the right hand side you
can see what it's showing,
01:44 - so I'm like "this is my variable
A, this is my variable B"
01:48 - and as you can imagine, the
point of a variable is like
01:51 - so you also don't have
to remember stuff, right?
01:53 - So for example, if you had
a variable like credit_card,
01:56 - and it was some crazy number
that you had to remember
02:01 - you don't have to remember anymore,
02:02 - you can just say print(credit_card)
every time, hit run,
02:05 - and it would print out
that number, so cool.
02:08 - Now, let's do something else
02:10 - because how I wanna teach you Python
02:13 - is in the fastest way possible
02:15 - and the most practical way possible
02:17 - and I also wanna show it to you in a way
02:19 - where you can actually learn visually,
02:22 - 'cause I think that's
the best way to learn.
02:24 - So to get the visual step started,
02:26 - that's the reason why we're
using something called turtle,
02:29 - okay, and I'm gonna name this
... "what are variables?"
02:37 - 'kay, plus "Turtle", okay,
I'm just gonna name it that.
02:40 - Okay, cool.
02:40 - And now what we're gonna do is
02:42 - we're gonna do something
cooler with variables.
02:45 - So let's say we say qazi_turtle
02:48 - is equal to turtle dot
Turtle(), like that.
02:51 - Make sure you capitalize
it in the right places,
02:54 - you put the dots in the right places,
02:55 - you put the parentheses
in the right places,
02:57 - 'cause if you get that stuff wrong
02:58 - code doesn't work, code breaks down,
03:02 - you're talking to a genie
with incredible power, right?
03:04 - So if you're talking to a genie
03:06 - with an incredible amount of power,
03:08 - you need to speak its language.
03:09 - So the computer is like a
genie with unlimited power
03:11 - so we gotta speak to it
and you gotta speak to it
03:13 - very precisely, which is very important.
03:15 - So, with that said, now
the qazi_turtle is there,
03:18 - let's go qazi dot turtle ...
qazi underscore turtle, my bad,
03:25 - qazi underscore turtle dot forward,
03:28 - and we're gonna say go forward by 100.
03:30 - Now I'm gonna click on
"result" instead of "console"
03:33 - and I'm gonna run this program.
03:35 - Now that I am gonna do
something with the turtle,
03:38 - turtle is gonna be this
graphical way for us to learn,
03:41 - so at the top we have to
write something called
03:43 - "import turtle", okay,
this is very important.
03:45 - Now that we do this, this code will work.
03:47 - I'll say qazi underscore turtle,
03:50 - and how I'm auto-completing
it is when it pops up
03:52 - I just hit tab, it auto-completes it.
03:54 - And I'll do turtle dot
forward 100, I'll hit enter,
03:57 - and you can see the turtle
just moved forward, right?
03:59 - The turtle goes like uh, uh, uh
04:02 - when I do turtle dot forward 100.
04:04 - Now, what if I did turtle
dot right 90 degrees, okay.
04:12 - So turtle dot right, and I do 90 degrees,
04:16 - watch what's gonna happen.
04:17 - The turtle's gonna move
forward and then turn.
04:19 - So what did it do, it
went eh, eh, eh, eh ...
04:23 - and then it goes like this, alright?
04:25 - That's what you're tryna do,
04:26 - you're tryna make it turn 90 degrees.
04:28 - And now the cool thing is
that I can just go like this,
04:32 - like this, hit enter, like this,
04:35 - and now the turtle, what did it just do?
04:37 - What, mm, mm, mm, mm, turns
around, and goes mm, mm, mm, mm.
04:43 - Now if I wanna make a square,
04:44 - I give you that as a challenge to do.
04:47 - That's a challenge for you to
do right now, pause the video
04:50 - and see if you can make it
a square, a full square.
04:53 - Alright, now un-pause
the video and let's go.
04:56 - So basically all I have to do, my friend,
04:58 - is I copy this guy, hit
paste, I run it again,
05:02 - and now the turtle goes bop
bop bop bop, it turns around,
05:06 - and goes pop, pop, pop, pop,
it turns to the right again,
05:09 - and it goes pop, pop, pop, pop 100, okay?
05:11 - So what are we gonna do?
05:13 - We're gonna repeat that
same step one more time,
05:16 - I'm just gonna go ahead
and paste that line of code
05:19 - twice again, and watch what happens.
05:22 - Boom, boom, boom, boom, and
the square has been completed.
05:25 - How fricking cool is that?
05:27 - So not only have you
learned what variables are,
05:30 - you have also gotten started
to learn Python visually
05:32 - and that's gonna be the really important
05:34 - fundamental building
blocks for when we learn
05:36 - if else statements, and
when we learn functions,
05:39 - and when we learn all
this other advanced stuff,
05:41 - what's gonna be super cool and super dope
05:43 - is that we're gonna be
learning it all visually
05:46 - so if you wanna make 10 squares,
05:48 - we'll just ride this loop de loop,
05:49 - and it'll make 10 squares in a row, right,
05:51 - and that's gonna be pretty awesome.
05:54 - I'm excited for you.
05:55 - I do wanna let you know
05:56 - that I'm gonna have a
course coming out called
05:58 - How to Automate Stuff with Python,
06:00 - so that's gonna into all
the basics of Python,
06:03 - but much more than the basics,
06:05 - it's gonna teach you
how to automate stuff,
06:07 - it's gonna teach you web scraping,
06:09 - it's gonna teach you
some basic data analysis,
06:11 - but the most important
thing it's gonna show you
06:13 - is how you can go from complete zero
06:15 - to then getting closer to making
06:17 - your first $1000 with Python
and having the skill set.
06:21 - So if you're interested in that course,
06:22 - when it's gonna be coming up,
06:24 - just click on one of the
description in the link below
06:27 - and you can actually go
sign up on the waiting list
06:29 - so when it's out you're
the first one to know
06:32 - and, as a matter of fact,
once you sign up for it
06:34 - I'm gonna give you access
06:35 - to an epic three-part free,
completely free masterclass
06:39 - that's unbelievable, that's
gonna blow your mind,
06:42 - and really help you
accelerate on your path
06:45 - to becoming a developer
and even working your way
06:48 - to a six-figure developer.
06:50 - Alright, again, thank you so
much for watching this video.
06:52 - In the next video we're gonna go deeper,
06:55 - we're gonna have more fun.
06:56 - As always, I love your face
06:57 - and I'll see you in the next video.
