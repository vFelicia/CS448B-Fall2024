00:00 - - [Instructor] So in this video,
00:01 - you're gonna be able to,
00:02 - if you watch this, you're
gonna learn things like
00:04 - how do you work with datetimes,
00:06 - how do you work with datetime objects.
00:08 - How can you take a string
00:10 - and turn it into a datetime.
00:12 - The benefits overall of this like
00:14 - you're like, what the hell is this?
00:15 - If you're a complete
beginner and you're like
00:17 - I'm just totally lost.
00:18 - What the fuck are you talking about Qazi?
00:19 - If you wanna be able to calculate
00:21 - the difference between
today and your birthday,
00:24 - you'll be able to do that.
00:25 - If you wanna make an app,
00:27 - that can send an email to somebody
00:29 - after two days after they
sign up automatically,
00:32 - you need to know how datetimes work.
00:34 - If you wanna be able to
make an Instagram clone
00:37 - and you wanna do things like
00:38 - when somebody makes a
post and time stamps it
00:40 - in their time zone and shows
the time in their time zone,
00:43 - when they log into the app,
00:45 - then you need to know
how to use datetimes.
00:48 - So without any further ado,
00:49 - let's jump right into it.
00:51 - (peppy music)
00:55 - Alright so we're gonna import datetime.
00:59 - This you don't have to
PIP install this package.
01:01 - It comes built in with Python
01:03 - and it allows you to do
fancy stuff with dates.
01:06 - So for example, I can do,
01:08 - let's say if I wanted to get today's date,
01:10 - I will do today and I
will do datetime.date,
01:14 - and I can put in year,
01:19 - so you can see my Python is
telling me what arguments
01:23 - it takes, so it can year as an integer.
01:25 - It can take month as an
integer and day as an integer.
01:28 - So remember it takes it as an integer.
01:30 - Actually for today, I should
probably just leave it blank
01:33 - even and say today.
01:37 - And if I print out today,
01:40 - let's run this guy.
01:42 - It will give me the date of today.
01:44 - So that's how you will deal with today.
01:47 - If I want to do birthday, my birthday,
01:50 - I'll do datetime.date
01:52 - and now I'll pass in what
I actually want to pass in.
01:56 - So I'll pass in let's say the year 1994,
01:59 - the month seven, make
sure you don't do 07,
02:03 - because 07 is not an integer.
02:05 - So it'll give you an error.
02:07 - You can't start an integer with a zero
02:09 - that's leading it.
02:11 - So we'll say 7 July 14th is my birthday,
02:14 - and then we will go like
okay like print birthday.
02:20 - Let's see what that looks like, cool.
02:22 - So it's printing it out and
showing it to you as a string
02:25 - but it's actually not a string.
02:26 - Birthday is really an object here,
02:29 - because if I call the wrapper method,
02:32 - it will show you that it
is indeed a datetime object
02:37 - and not just a string like
it shows you in the terminal.
02:40 - So do not get confused by that.
02:44 - So we're gonna create
something called since birth.
02:46 - I want to see how many
days have I been alive?
02:49 - Very important.
02:50 - So I'll say days since birth,
02:56 - and what we'll do is we'll
say today minus birthday.
03:04 - And then let's do days since births.
03:07 - Let's print this bad boy out.
03:09 - It says 9004 days.
03:12 - Now if I really want to make sure that
03:13 - I'm getting back days is I should do this,
03:16 - and then I should do dot days.
03:19 - This will make sure that I get back days
03:21 - and I don't get a datetime object back.
03:24 - So this is telling me days since birth,
03:27 - which is kind of useful I guess.
03:31 - Pretty useful important
and that's how you can,
03:35 - you can subtract dates, you
can add dates and all that.
03:39 - If I create a timedelta,
03:43 - so let's say I'll do timedelta,
03:47 - I'll create datetime.timedelta
03:53 - and I will say days equal 10.
03:58 - And now I'll say to today,
to the date of today,
04:04 - which is March 9th,
04:05 - just add ten days to that.
04:07 - That's it, so I'll just do plus timedelta.
04:11 - Now when I run it what I
get back as you can see
04:14 - right here is March 9th
has 10 days added to it.
04:19 - And what do you get when you
add 10 days to March 9th.
04:22 - That's right, you guessed it correctly,
04:25 - you get back March 19th.
04:28 - So this way you can add to dates,
04:30 - you can subtract from dates,
04:32 - if you do minus here.
04:35 - Let's do minus like that
04:37 - and we can run it and boom,
04:39 - we have subtracted ten days from that.
04:42 - Now the reason why you
want to use libraries
04:43 - is because otherwise this
stuff can get very confusing,
04:46 - very, very quickly,
04:49 - because like for example
February only has 28 days.
04:52 - And sometimes it has 29 days
04:54 - and some months have 30 days and 31 days
04:56 - and then you got to take
leap years into account,
04:58 - and you got to take all this
other crap into account.
05:01 - So that's why you don't
want to create your
05:02 - own functions for this.
05:03 - You want to just use
something that somebody's made
05:05 - called datetime.
05:06 - Makes your life a lot easier.
05:10 - Alright so I've shown you
how to add and subtract
05:14 - time using timedelta.
05:16 - I've shown you how to
create datetime objects.
05:20 - And I've shown you how to like
pull out the current days.
05:23 - You can pull out the current month too.
05:25 - So like for example I
can do today that month.
05:32 - And if I run it, it'll give
us that it's the third month
05:35 - because it's March.
05:37 - I can do today.day, and if I
run it, it'll tell me that.
05:42 - I can also do today.weekday.
05:48 - So this will tell me what weekday is it.
05:51 - So right now it's telling
me yo this is the fifth day
05:55 - of the week and let's check.
05:59 - Sorry this is the sixth day of the week,
06:04 - because it says, Monday is equal to zero,
06:11 - and Sunday is equal to six.
06:14 - Okay so computers mostly start at zero
06:17 - and go up to six.
06:20 - So that's why if you do week day,
06:22 - that's why it gives you five.
06:24 - And it is the fifth day indeed
because it's Saturday today.
06:30 - It's all right here.
06:31 - Saturday is equal to five.
06:38 - So there are many methods like that
06:41 - that are very useful.
06:43 - Now something else that's useful
06:45 - when it comes to datetimes is
06:47 - we've covered datetimes.
06:48 - We have covered deltas,
06:50 - but what now we want to know
is okay how do we deal with
06:54 - hours, minutes, and seconds.
06:56 - So let's do that.
06:59 - We will do something that will show us,
07:06 - will do datetime.time
07:10 - and essentially when you pass time,
07:13 - you can pass in hour, minutes,
second and microseconds.
07:17 - So we will pass in our seven minute
07:27 - to seconds 20 and microseconds 15.
07:39 - And then we can also
pass in time zone info,
07:42 - and what we want the time zone to be,
07:44 - but for now we'll just leave it blank,
07:47 - and let's print this out and
let's see what that says.
07:52 - So that essentially just
gave us a datetime.timeob.
07:56 - So give us a datetime object,
07:59 - where it's giving us the
hours, minutes, and seconds.
08:03 - But again I also, Cori
I was watching his video
08:07 - and he says that he
uses primarily datetime,
08:11 - and I agree with that
08:12 - because I used to use time
08:15 - but then I realized that there,
08:17 - so there is three different ones.
08:19 - There's datetime.date.
08:22 - Then there is datetime.time,
08:27 - and then there's datetime.datetime,
08:30 - and this is sometimes confusing
08:31 - but here's what it really is.
08:34 - So datetime.date is just
year, month, and day.
08:41 - Datetime.time is just hours, minutes,
08:46 - seconds and microseconds.
08:49 - And datetime.datetime is this,
08:52 - year, month, day and hours, minutes,
08:56 - seconds and milliseconds.
08:59 - That's essentially what you need access to
09:01 - because this has access to everything.
09:03 - So most of the time you
should really be working with
09:07 - datetime.datetime.
09:12 - All right now when
we're working with these
09:16 - well we can do the same
thing of timedelta.
09:20 - All right so if you have a datetime object
09:22 - like datetime.datetime thing,
09:24 - you can still do timedelta,
09:27 - and it'll automatically
do all the math for you,
09:30 - including the hours math as well.
09:32 - So you see how we created, we did days,
09:35 - if you add 10 days,
well you can also create
09:38 - let's say we create an hour delta
09:41 - and we do datetime.timedelta
09:45 - and instead we pass in hours,
09:47 - and we say so right now it's almost 6 p.m.
09:51 - So if I add 10 hours to today.
09:54 - So if I add 10 hours to right now right.
09:57 - So for example if I do
datetime.datetime.now,
10:00 - first of all let's print that out.
10:02 - So I'll do print and I'll run it.
10:05 - So it's telling you that yo look,
10:07 - it's essentially 6 p.m.
10:10 - That's in military time 17th hour.
10:16 - Now if I add the timedelta to this
10:18 - and I do hour delta and I run this,
10:21 - well you'll see it'll say March 10th,
10:23 - which is the next day,
10:25 - because it makes sense right?
10:26 - It's 3 AM into the next day.
10:29 - So you can also do
timedelta just like that.
10:33 - Let's move on.
10:36 - I'll write little notes here for you.
10:38 - So I'll say that this is 10 hours,
10:47 - add 10 hours to current day.
10:52 - That's what this part
of the code is doing.
10:55 - This part of the code is
adding 10 days to current day.
11:06 - Find days since birth,
11:10 - is that what's that piece of code doing?
11:14 - Okay so we have covered quite a bit.
11:17 - Now let's move on to a few more things
11:23 - when it comes to datetime.
11:25 - What you want your
datetime to do is be aware
11:29 - of the time zones.
11:30 - Oftentimes the day time object by default
11:33 - is called naïve.
11:35 - So it's not aware of time zones,
11:38 - meaning that it doesn't
understand what is Mountain Time
11:46 - versus Pacific time
versus some other time.
11:50 - So in different countries you
have different time zones.
11:53 - But it won't know the difference.
11:56 - You have to tell it to be time zone aware
12:00 - AKA not naïve.
12:03 - So let's go ahead and do that.
12:08 - We will take a datetime object like today.
12:12 - So I'm just gonna do
datetime.datetime.now,
12:18 - and what I'll do is we're gonna
use a package called pytz.
12:26 - P-Y-T-Z.
12:28 - So you have to install it.
12:30 - What I'm gonna do is I will
simply install that package
12:34 - using my PIP install.
12:36 - So I'll go to the terminal here
12:38 - and I will do PIP install pytz.
12:41 - And if you don't already have
it, go ahead and install it.
12:44 - It looks like I already
have it, so that's good.
12:48 - Let's go back to running this code, cool.
12:54 - And I will import pytz at the top.
12:58 - Now that I have that what
I can do is I can say
13:04 - time zone is equal to pytz.utc.
13:17 - So now let's print that out
13:19 - and what you'll see is that
13:21 - not only does this datetime object give me
13:24 - the year, the month, the day, the hour,
13:29 - the minutes, the seconds,
and the microseconds
13:32 - but it also gives me,
13:36 - it also has made it UTC enabled,
13:39 - but right now it's at plus zero zero.
13:42 - So now because it's aware,
13:45 - we can give it a different time zone.
13:48 - So let's try that.
13:55 - So this is datetime today.
14:00 - And what we'll do is
we'll go datetime.pacific.
14:11 - And I will do datetimetoday.astimezone,
14:19 - and I will pass in the pytz time zone,
14:25 - except I will pass in US/Pacific,
14:29 - because I'm in LA and we
are on the Pacific time zone
14:34 - and let's print that out.
14:41 - Okay so minus eight.
14:43 - That's what I wanted
14:44 - and that's what Pacific time zone is.
14:47 - So that's how you can
make it time zone aware
14:50 - and pass time zones.
14:51 - There's a list of all the time zones.
14:53 - So again this is also from
Cori Schaeffer's tutorial,
14:59 - and he just loops through it,
15:00 - which I thought is really
cool for a time zone in,
15:05 - for a time zone in oh,
15:09 - yeah it was just called,
let's just do that,
15:11 - because there's already a time zone here,
15:13 - so you don't want to create any confusion.
15:17 - Pytz.timezones.pytz.alltimezones,
15:29 - let's print time zone.
15:33 - And when I run it you'll see that it
15:34 - shows all these time
zones like US Pacific,
15:37 - US Mountain, US Central, US/Alaska,
15:41 - Pacific, Indian and Europe,
15:45 - pretty much all of the
time zones in the world.
15:51 - That's where that I got the list from.
15:53 - That's where I figured
out where this came from.
15:57 - If you look it up online,
15:59 - it'll probably be even easier
16:01 - because then you don't
have to scroll through
16:03 - your command line.
16:03 - It'll be in a nice little table for you.
16:06 - Alright so now what we want to do is
16:08 - we want to be able to take
that time and format it.
16:10 - So we're gonna do something
called string formatting.
16:13 - So we're gonna do string
formatting with dates.
16:21 - So all that means is we'll
take some ugly-looking date,
16:23 - that it shows and maybe in this format,
16:27 - where it goes 2019 03 March and 09,
16:33 - and essentially we want
to be able to show it
16:35 - such as March 3rd like that,
16:40 - and then it should say 2019.
16:44 - Okay so let's make it
look a little pretty.
16:47 - How do we do that?
16:48 - Well let's take our Pacific time,
16:50 - datetime Pacific that we had here,
16:53 - and simply we'll do string formatting.
16:57 - That's what this F is for.
17:00 - So we're essentially
string formatting time.
17:02 - That's what we're doing here.
17:10 - Capital B is for the month.
17:11 - Don't ask why, it just is.
17:15 - Small D is for the day
17:17 - and then percent capital
y is for the year.
17:22 - Let's print this bad boy and run it
17:25 - and you see the date looking really nice.
17:28 - Oh sorry today is not March 3rd.
17:29 - It's March 9th, my bad.
17:32 - So we wanted to look like this
17:34 - and that's what it did.
17:36 - It made it look nice.
17:37 - Now how do we go the other way?
17:40 - Let's say that we have this thing.
17:44 - We have March 09 2019
17:47 - and maybe this is you pull it from
17:49 - a website somewhere right?
17:51 - So on some website somewhere,
17:52 - this is how dates are written.
17:54 - Well how do you take that written date
17:56 - and turn it into a datetime object,
17:59 - so then you can do some
manipulation on it?
18:03 - How do we go from essentially this
18:07 - to like a datetime object?
18:22 - Kind of like that.
18:23 - How do we do that?
18:25 - How do we go from this guy
to then getting that guy?
18:29 - Well for this we use a
method called SGRP time.
18:35 - I need to turn off, disable inspection.
18:44 - There we go.
18:46 - So here we use the method strftime.
18:51 - Here we're going to use strptime.
18:54 - P is equal to parsing,
18:59 - and the F in this is equal to formatting.
19:03 - So that's one way to remember all this.
19:07 - Now what we'll do is I'll say
19:17 - take a datetime string.
19:18 - So what I'll do is this.
19:20 - I'll go like this.
19:21 - We'll say boom datetime.datetime.strptime
19:26 - and I'll give it a string.
19:27 - So let's say I give it March 09, 2019,
19:33 - and you have to teach it how it's written.
19:39 - So I'm gonna say because
it says the month here,
19:41 - I'll put capital B like that.
19:45 - Because it says the day here,
19:46 - I'll put %D like this
19:49 - and then because there's a
comma, I'll put the comma,
19:52 - and then year is here.
19:53 - So I'll do this like that alright.
19:56 - And we will call this datetime thing,
20:09 - and then we'll print
it out datetime thing.
20:12 - Just run it and boom, this is what it,
20:16 - if I actually put a wrapper around it.
20:22 - You can see that it's actually
now a datetimedatetime object
20:28 - rather than just being a March 9th string.
20:32 - We took it from the
string and by using this
20:35 - and telling it how its formatted,
20:37 - we turned it into an actual object
20:41 - and now that it's an object,
20:42 - you can add this, you can subtract this.
20:45 - You could do all kinds of stuff.
20:48 - Now this is all great.
20:51 - This pretty much covers almost everything
20:54 - that we wanted to touch base on.
20:57 - Like the most common
problems that people have
20:59 - with datetimes, adding
and subtracting datetimes,
21:03 - timedeltas which is very
common and then people
21:05 - want to also know how to format it
21:08 - and show it, print out
a date in a regular way,
21:11 - and then you also want to be
able to go from a regular date
21:14 - into a datetime object.
21:15 - So we've done all of that.
21:16 - We've also done some time zone stuff,
21:18 - but what I want to show you now is
21:23 - if you have the opportunity to
work with a different module,
21:26 - different thing instead of datetime,
21:28 - your life will be a lot easier.
21:31 - So what I recommend that you
use is something called Maya.
21:35 - Alright Maya which is we'll put the link
21:39 - in the description of this YouTube video.
21:43 - So please Frankie when you're editing,
21:46 - just remember to pop this
into the youtube description.
21:50 - And essentially Maya is
considered datetime for humans,
21:56 - and all it does is it just
makes it a lot easier.
21:58 - Kenneth Reitz says, he
wrote this and he made it.
22:01 - So it's simpler to deal with things.
22:04 - So for example when you want to do
22:10 - when is tomorrow, like
when you want to do set
22:13 - something to tomorrow right,
22:14 - like look at hour, even hour today.
22:17 - It's kind of confusing.
22:19 - It's kind of funny.
22:20 - If we want to add a tomorrow here,
22:22 - what we would have to
do is add this delta.
22:27 - We would have to add a one day delta
22:29 - and then it would give us tomorrow
22:31 - whereas for Maya you
can literally just say
22:34 - Maya.when tomorrow.
22:36 - So you can give it a
little datetime object Maya
22:38 - and when you do Maya.when
and you write tomorrow,
22:41 - it'll figure out when tomorrow is.
22:44 - It can also automatically
do slang for you,
22:48 - which is pretty cool.
22:50 - 23 three hours from now or
10 hours from now instead
22:53 - of writing another way,
it's these built-in methods
22:56 - but what's really cool to me
22:59 - is how it can automatically
parse datetime strings
23:05 - and generate naive or not naive datetimes.
23:08 - So you can give it a datetime string
23:13 - and call this parse method on it
23:15 - and literally right then and there
23:17 - you can also give it a timezone,
23:19 - and it will automatically
figure it all out.
23:22 - It will take it from this string
23:25 - and turn it into US Eastern time zone.
23:29 - It's that easy.
23:36 - And also how it prints things out,
23:38 - it makes it really easy for you.
23:39 - So instead of them looking really funny,
23:41 - the print methods of this
also looks really nice.
23:44 - When you print something out,
23:45 - it tells you Wednesday

23:49 - and so when you're working on things
23:51 - that's also easier.
23:54 - Another thing that I like
about this is to add delta.
23:58 - All you got to do is just do .add
24:01 - alright and then it will
automatically add things
24:06 - essentially for you.
24:10 - So you don't have to like worry about
24:12 - or do kind of anything on your own.
24:16 - It will just add it.
24:17 - So you just do dot add
then do days.equalten.days,
24:21 - so it goes from seven to
seventeen just like that.
24:25 - And I like how it says always here
24:27 - because what it does is
whenever you run dot timezone,
24:32 - it's always in UTC.
24:34 - So it's time zone aware
at all times by default,
24:37 - unlike the datetime objects,
24:38 - which are not aware by default.
24:43 - And the advanced usage is really cool too.
24:47 - So if you're building
an app which has to do
24:49 - with a lot of calendar type of things,
24:51 - and you want to create an
event that is an hour long
24:53 - that starts now.
24:55 - Well it's super easy.
24:56 - Events start which is
just Maya.now so time.now
25:00 - or datetime.now if you
were using datetime.
25:03 - So just Maya.now
25:06 - and to the now, the event, end
is just the Maya.now.addhours
25:13 - equal one so you just added
that one hour delta to it
25:17 - in a very easy way by just
saying dot add hours equal one.
25:21 - And then you can use this thing
called Maya interval class.
25:25 - So it's a really powerful class
25:28 - and you can give it a
start date of event start
25:31 - and you can give it an
end date of event end,
25:34 - and it automatically can
create that event for you.
25:41 - Now there are other
modules as well such as
25:45 - Delorean, Arrow, and Pendulum.
25:48 - So Arrow is something
I've used in the past
25:50 - and Arrow is something that
Cori in his video recommends,
25:55 - but I believe that Maya is gonna get,
25:59 - is a little bit more
sane and will get most
26:02 - of the job done.
26:03 - Arrow can do more
26:05 - but I do believe that Maya
does things a lot better.
26:10 - And if Kenneth Reitz is doing it,
26:12 - then you know that it's gonna be right.
26:15 - So I would stick with Maya,
26:17 - and you can still use
these together with it.
26:21 - It complements them.
26:23 - He even says that here
that it complements them.
26:29 - All right so that's really
what I wanted to cover
26:32 - in this video.
26:32 - It's super easy to install it.
26:34 - Just pip install Maya
and you'll be good to go.
26:37 - So yeah that's the main
things I wanted to cover.
26:40 - I hope that you enjoyed this video.
26:42 - I hope it was informative.
26:44 - You've learned something new,
26:45 - and that you go now and
create maybe even some
26:49 - project with datetimes.
26:51 - That's how you'll improve in it.
26:52 - That's how you'll become better.
26:54 - With that said we do have a new program
26:57 - that's gonna be coming out
we're working hard at it
27:00 - with our entire team,
27:02 - and this is a program that's whether
27:04 - you're a beginner or a
professional developer,
27:07 - is gonna help you take your
skills to the next level.
27:09 - So whether your goal is
to land your first job
27:12 - or your goal is to get a
promotion at your current job
27:16 - or maybe you want to just
become a much better freelancer
27:21 - and crush it at freelancing,
27:23 - well then we will have a new program
27:26 - for you called how to
automate stuff with Python.
27:29 - It will give you all
the essential trainings
27:32 - you need to technically become
an incredible developer,
27:36 - and we will dive deep into
Python into programming,
27:39 - and we will create many
different projects.
27:42 - You will go much deeper into
concepts like web scraping,
27:45 - data mining and just overall
to handle really big projects,
27:54 - and take your skills to the next level.
27:57 - With that said, all you need to do to
27:59 - join the wait list for this course 'cos
28:02 - it's gonna be coming out
hopefully sometime soon,
28:04 - but we're working on it really hard.
28:07 - So just in the description
below, click the link.
28:11 - It's gonna take you to
a page where it says
28:14 - how to automate stuff with Python.
28:15 - Pop in your email and your name
28:18 - and I will send you a free gift
28:21 - once you do this.
28:22 - We'll send you a three-part
epic training master class
28:25 - perhaps, and also when
the course opens up,
28:31 - you will be the first to know
that way you won't miss out.
