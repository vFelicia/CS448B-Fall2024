00:00 - check this out what's up erin what are
00:01 - we talking about today
00:03 - yeah so we're talking about this new ai
00:05 - tool from open
00:06 - um ai so here's a demo of it real quick
00:08 - i found a video just it's just easier to
00:10 - show you guys but check it out this guy
00:11 - types in uh
00:12 - he just describes an app to this thing
00:14 - called dbuild.co and it literally just
00:16 - spits stuff out so check it out he's
00:18 - like
00:18 - he says an input that says enter a to do
00:20 - and a button that says save to do
00:22 - and then show me a list of all my to do
00:24 - so very simple to do app i'm sure
00:25 - most of you guys have coded this before
00:28 - but he just types that in
00:30 - and then it's uh it's generating and
00:32 - then right there you have the app
00:33 - generated on the side
00:34 - interspersed there so the input you hit
00:37 - the button
00:38 - there and then look there's all the
00:40 - react code it's react code straight up
00:41 - react code
00:42 - what like um what just generated
00:46 - there blew my mind too i mean like yeah
00:48 - there's like code completion and stuff
00:50 - but this is a full-on app and look
00:51 - there's even another one here
00:53 - where uh look it says designer it says
00:56 - uh create an app here design so an app
00:59 - that has a navigation bar with a camera
01:01 - icon
01:02 - photos title and a message icon a feed
01:04 - of photos with each photo having a user
01:06 - icon
01:06 - a photo a heart icon and uh something
01:10 - else
01:10 - and then it literally just generates
01:12 - this no it's the ground
01:14 - yeah yeah that is
01:18 - mind-blowing i mean this is like a month
01:20 - and a half old
01:21 - but it blew my it blew my mind it blew
01:23 - my mind wow
01:24 - guys what do you think about that drop
01:26 - them in the comments what are your
01:27 - thoughts on this this is
01:28 - freaking insane can you show it one more
01:30 - time for everybody to go on here
01:31 - time yeah show one more time uh all
01:33 - right let's go back let's go back where
01:34 - is it
01:35 - boom i can't do i mean it's the same
01:38 - thing there's a bunch of other examples
01:40 - but let's just show these same ones
01:41 - first real quick so yeah so this
01:44 - you just type in you type in what you
01:46 - wanted to code and then the ai will
01:47 - literally
01:48 - figure out how to code it for you like
01:49 - it'll it'll like
01:51 - parse your what you said to it it'll
01:52 - understand it and then it'll actually
01:54 - code up the code
01:55 - with correct syntax and it's functioning
01:57 - there in about two seconds
01:58 - no man come on this is i mean the first
02:02 - thing that
02:02 - came from guys we are taking our jobs
02:04 - they are taking our jobs is what they're
02:06 - doing no it's not cool
02:08 - yeah yeah pretty much but i mean also
02:11 - that but also it's like i feel like
02:12 - like this is gonna like drastically
02:15 - change like how we how we code because
02:17 - if you can get something up and running
02:18 - like the like 80 of it with
02:21 - you know like a sentence and then you
02:23 - just hit enter and then two seconds
02:24 - later it's pretty much done you have the
02:25 - whole framework of your idea implemented
02:27 - then it's just a matter of going and
02:28 - debugging and doing all this stuff that
02:30 - isn't quite smart enough to do wow

05:59 - anyways guys let's tell this guy
06:00 - something guys tell this guy this this
06:02 - guy this guy needs to be i don't know
06:03 - tell this guy something
06:10 - anyways yeah so yeah this thing gpt-3
06:13 - um he's gonna take he's gonna be taking
06:14 - all of our jobs pretty much oh it's
06:16 - gonna be doing this it's
06:17 - it's uh open ai's new ai called gpt3 so
06:20 - open ai
06:21 - uh if you guys haven't heard of it open
06:24 - ai is actually
06:25 - a open source ai company and their
06:27 - purpose is kind of to
06:28 - responsibly develop ais so that we don't
06:31 - have an ultron or terminator incident
06:33 - um because once it's a certain point
06:35 - once the ai gets smart enough to like
06:36 - learn faster than humans and blood with
06:38 - them we're kind of
06:39 - screwed apparently it's called the
06:41 - singularity i don't know if it's true or
06:42 - not nobody does until it happens but
06:44 - that's kind of open ai it was founded by
06:46 - elon musk and
06:47 - sam alton
06:50 - sam something i think his name is um but
06:53 - he was co-founded
06:55 - with elon in 2015 i think and they've
06:57 - been working on it since
06:58 - uh if you guys have heard about the um
07:01 - the ai that actually because there was
07:03 - already ai's that be like the world
07:04 - chess championship and stuff like that
07:06 - uh but opening i was were the guys who
07:08 - actually coded up a bot that beat
07:10 - uh video gamers so like the professional
07:12 - world-class video gamers in
07:13 - um dota i've never played dota but it's
07:16 - kind of like league of legends
07:17 - uh basically coded in ai for these
07:19 - people and it basically just shot on the
07:21 - world championships
07:22 - no wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
07:23 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
07:23 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
07:23 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
07:23 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
07:23 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
07:23 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
07:23 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
07:23 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
07:23 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
07:23 - wait wait wait wait wait so let's just
07:24 - call it it coded up in a
07:26 - ai game yeah it's a bot no no no so it's
07:30 - like
07:30 - it's a bot that plays the game and then
07:32 - when the when the players were playing
07:33 - against the bots they were
07:35 - free because it's like you can they're
07:37 - like i can tell it's not you it's too
07:39 - perfect they can tell it's not human
07:40 - it's too smart
07:41 - it learns faster it counters everything
07:42 - before they even do it so guys
07:44 - we're on the verge of the zombie
07:46 - apocalypse out here the apocalypse
07:48 - coming soon
07:51 - it's a couple years ago i know yeah
07:53 - zombie nah bro the robot apocalypse
07:55 - what are you talking about zombie
07:56 - apocalypse already here that's the
07:58 - corona
08:01 - it's the irobot you know we'll smith
08:03 - anyways dude we're taking too long
08:05 - but yeah so if you open it i did that a
08:07 - couple years ago but now now they're
08:09 - doing some big boy stuff where they're
08:10 - doing some like actually real stuff
08:11 - instead of just video games like games
08:13 - are cool and they're fun but i mean
08:14 - when you're talking about like real ai
08:16 - doing stuff in the real world like
08:17 - coding or other crazy stuff then that's
08:19 - when it starts getting really
08:20 - interesting and the applications get
08:22 - um insane instead of just like within
08:24 - this one game
08:25 - yeah so um so let's go on so what is
08:28 - gpt3 because i mean it just looks like
08:30 - um
08:31 - it's like some it looks like a car model
08:32 - or something you know like oh the nissan
08:34 - gpc3 oh my goodness
08:36 - but so what it actually stands for is
08:40 - um uh general pre-trained
08:44 - transformer three which makes no sense
08:45 - to explain a little bit later but that's
08:46 - just what it is in general
08:50 - yeah or generic pre-trained transformer
08:52 - three something like that
08:53 - yeah that's not like a movie oh god
08:56 - uh but pretty much it's an ai that can
08:58 - write code as you guys saw
08:59 - so like like straight up like it can
09:03 - anything you tell it you can tell it
09:04 - anything you want and it'll figure out
09:05 - what you mean and then it'll just spit
09:07 - out the html the css
09:09 - um the everything that you need the
09:11 - functionality the buttons all the math
09:12 - behind it all the logic but no syntax
09:14 - errors
09:15 - like it just figures it out like no
09:16 - matter like any arbitrary thing you tell
09:18 - it you can be like yo
09:19 - uh code an app that like like uh gives
09:22 - me pictures of watermelons and random
09:23 - stuff
09:24 - blah blah blah and it'll just do it like
09:25 - like look here so here here's a little
09:27 - you put up an app can you can you code
09:28 - up an app that will that will make me
09:30 - thousands of dollars and uh in terms of
09:32 - stocks
09:34 - um i mean i don't think it's that smart
09:36 - yet if it was that would be
09:39 - i mean if it was that smart honestly the
09:40 - ai would be richer than everybody in a
09:42 - few days
09:42 - you know because if it could do that but
09:45 - but look here so this guy
09:46 - uh this is a similar thing so the guy
09:48 - just types in he wants a button that
09:50 - looks like a watermelon
09:51 - and then he clicks you generate and it
09:52 - literally just spits out the it fits out
09:55 - the html code right there
09:56 - the correct tag it's the html button tag
09:58 - and then it even knows what a watermelon
10:00 - looks like and it has like the color
10:01 - like it understands what a watermelon
10:03 - looks like
10:04 - just by saying that and then it'll like
10:06 - actually make a green
10:08 - circle with a pink interior with in the
10:10 - word watermelon on it and it's a button
10:11 - like it doesn't do anything because it's
10:12 - like a like a really simple example
10:14 - but like it's just a completely random
10:16 - thing like you just type in a
10:18 - he could even type orange and it would
10:19 - do the same thing would be an orange
10:20 - circle or apple it'd be a red circle
10:22 - um unfortunately i can't access the code
10:24 - i'll explain guys later why you can't
10:26 - ask the code right now i'm kind of
10:27 - limited to just showing you guys
10:29 - uh this this content i found online but
10:31 - look here's another one so he says
10:33 - uh give me some large text that says
10:35 - welcome to my newsletter and a blue
10:36 - button that says subscribe
10:37 - and it just no way it's pretty fast i
10:40 - mean it flashes pretty quickly but
10:42 - look it says uh
10:45 - boom welcome to my newsletter and the
10:47 - subscribe button it says subscribe
10:49 - man no i don't like this anything i
10:52 - don't like

11:48 - clone
11:49 - um on mobile so like it must be doing uh
11:52 - something i don't know exactly
11:53 - though i couldn't get the code for this
11:54 - it was just what i found online right
11:56 - and then um yeah the the to do the to-do
12:00 - list app again
12:01 - but yo it's it's pretty crazy man pretty

12:50 - you know i just worked on your stuff but
12:52 - yo yeah so i found this
12:54 - but i found some other stuff too like
12:55 - guys i found this um
12:58 - uh this twitter page of this guy who got
12:59 - access to the code because the code is
13:01 - locked
13:01 - because elon musk uh and people guys are
13:04 - opening i don't want just anybody using
13:05 - it because
13:06 - it can be kind of dangerous so you have
13:08 - to like request
13:09 - access like um if you go to open a
13:11 - website like they say
13:12 - you can download api but you have to
13:14 - actually have to like join a waitlist
13:15 - here
13:16 - and um so you can actually download the
13:18 - code
13:20 - oh no it's an api so like you actually
13:22 - have to run this on like a super
13:23 - computer
13:23 - like on a cluster somewhere because it's
13:25 - huge i'm going to go into some of the
13:26 - details about how it works later
13:28 - right um but just like show you i'm just
13:29 - showcasing it now but like everything
13:31 - that we know about it and we found but
13:32 - yeah
13:32 - you have to join the api waitlist and
13:34 - then if you get access then you can
13:35 - actually um access their api and use it
13:38 - um which is what those those those code
13:41 - generators were doing it was just using
13:42 - the api and then
13:43 - actually running on on their cluster on
13:45 - their super computer
13:47 - um but i mean it's very limited access
13:49 - like not everybody gets it so i didn't i
13:50 - applied but i didn't
13:51 - they didn't get back to me and uh a few
13:54 - people only a few people did
13:56 - a few a few companies did you know but
13:58 - uh so like yeah
13:59 - it's funny you know it's funny we got
14:00 - some um elec is like
14:03 - like he's like uh write a program that
14:05 - can help cut it to remind exact time of
14:06 - starting
14:07 - the the stream
14:11 - yeah guys guys that program will that
14:13 - program will never will never be perfect
14:16 - yeah there's going to be always new bugs
14:18 - you know you will never know
14:23 - yeah i mean yeah yeah streams are just
14:26 - whatever they are but yeah anyways so
14:28 - this guy this guy sheriff shumim i found
14:30 - him on twitter
14:30 - um he actually i don't know how he got
14:32 - access but oh he's the ceo at
14:34 - d build.co okay okay he's the actual guy
14:37 - who uh he's the actual guy who
14:39 - developed this thing which is using the
14:41 - api oh that's cool
14:43 - okay yes oh um awesome so yeah let's
14:46 - just go down and look at some of the
14:47 - things he built so like i just want to
14:48 - show you guys that this isn't a spoofs
14:49 - so check this out check this out okay so
14:51 - let's see what this one is there's like
14:52 - there's like 20 of them let's go through
14:53 - all them
14:54 - so boom describe your app a header that
14:55 - says mood tracker okay and
14:58 - a button that says happy
15:01 - sad and sleepy okay
15:05 - when i press a button show text that's
15:07 - set
15:09 - right let me go fast okay this is taking
15:11 - forever where x is my movement how about
15:13 - you because you can you can do you can
15:14 - do 2x
15:15 - 2x speed on this is a twitter gif or
15:18 - something
15:18 - oh okay okay then you might not be able
15:20 - to do that you can just hand here let me
15:21 - see it's taking forever
15:23 - so look boom mood track happy sad
15:26 - sad sleepy right now i am feeling sleepy
15:28 - and it just like spits out the code look
15:30 - the react code
15:31 - right below what look he just can add on
15:33 - where x is an emoji for my mood
15:35 - oh my god i'm feeling and then he
15:37 - changed
15:38 - so he's using x but he's gonna plug in
15:40 - an emoji in place of x here
15:43 - okay no right now i'm feeling sad look
15:45 - at that bro
15:46 - no he literally just types literally
15:49 - just types um that
15:50 - that piece of that piece of text in hits
15:52 - generate
15:53 - and then it generates the code exactly
15:55 - like it understands you this
15:56 - api when you click on it does actually
15:58 - perform the function when you click on
15:59 - it
16:00 - yes that's running this code they're
16:01 - there like it's
16:03 - it's running like bro like that's what
16:05 - i'm saying like wow
16:06 - the ai understand what you're saying no
16:08 - matter the english you use like it
16:09 - understands english so well like this is
16:11 - like a
16:11 - this makes siri and alexa look like
16:13 - freaking babies you know like little
16:14 - toys like child's toys
16:16 - and this is like a this is like a real
16:18 - like a real
16:19 - language processor this is actually
16:21 - called the natural language processor ai
16:23 - so that's actually what is under the
16:24 - hood it can it can deal with any kind of
16:26 - text so it understands english and can
16:28 - pump out code because all of it is just
16:30 - english even the code is in english
16:31 - yeah considered english even though it's
16:33 - code but it's just text
16:35 - so it can understand how to write any
16:36 - arbitrary text even emojis as you saw
16:38 - like it can understand
16:39 - how to write anything just by through
16:41 - machine learning so
16:43 - strategically thinking i'm just kind of
16:44 - curious here out here so
16:46 - strategically thinking like possibly
16:48 - positively thinking
16:49 - yeah let me know let us know guys what
16:51 - do you think like what would you because
16:53 - obviously
16:53 - this still can't replace this still can
16:56 - replace a full-on like
16:57 - us right we're pretty smart no like no
16:59 - we're pretty smart like
17:01 - lucky or not like we're pretty smart
17:02 - people we're most people you know aaron
17:04 - can be questionable but
17:07 - i'm kidding i'm kidding bro so
17:10 - so so we're pretty smart people right so
17:12 - you know this is not
17:13 - not able to replace us but but i think
17:16 - it does
17:17 - frank i think mentioned actually on here
17:18 - he mentioned that it can help us out in
17:21 - terms of like
17:22 - it can help us out in terms of making
17:25 - boilerplate stuff
17:26 - so like boiling exactly you know what i
17:28 - mean yeah so like do all the dirty work
17:30 - for you it's like the long grueling
17:32 - dirty work like do you
17:33 - even like not even dirty but the way i
17:35 - see it guys let us know what you guys
17:36 - think
17:36 - like uh let us know like what would you
17:38 - like what would you use
17:40 - this for right if you think of this on a
17:43 - positive more side okay instead of the
17:44 - negative side
17:46 - i would use it for actually thinking
17:48 - personally
17:49 - here's how i use it for because this can
17:50 - be pretty easy i would use it actually
17:52 - for unit testing
17:55 - oh yeah how would you do that
17:59 - easy create a unit test for a function
18:02 - for
18:02 - a class for let's say for a class car
18:06 - right okay to test to test a button
18:09 - click
18:10 - on something something where you know
18:12 - when you click the button it should
18:13 - display the text
18:14 - you know hello world i don't know
18:18 - wait what do you mean by like unit
18:20 - testing like unit testing to me is like
18:22 - when you're coding an app you want to
18:23 - whenever you add a new line of code you
18:24 - want to run it to make sure it doesn't
18:26 - break
18:26 - no no no no no no what i'm saying yeah
18:28 - well it's a function basically you know
18:29 - test
18:29 - is a is a task separate from your code
18:32 - it's a code that tests other people's
18:33 - code
18:35 - oh yeah so you mean like actual like
18:36 - unit test snippets yeah like actually
18:39 - actually it would actually code up unit
18:41 - testing because this can code up react
18:43 - it can probably in that just code up
18:44 - anything python right javascript that's
18:46 - the real that's the real unit testing
18:48 - where you have to like do everything
18:49 - properly and
18:50 - non-sloppy you know it's not for me yeah
18:53 - yeah no but seriously i i honestly think
18:55 - guys what do you think give me give us a
18:56 - thumbs up you know if you think this
18:58 - might actually be very useful because
18:59 - i know i know i don't like to write unit
19:01 - tests nobody likes to write unit tests
19:03 - but we gotta do it sometimes yeah yeah
19:05 - you could like pump it you could like
19:06 - give it your entire app
19:08 - and then you could just be like test if
19:10 - this function works and it would write
19:11 - the unit test for that
19:12 - thing test if this works test if that
19:15 - works
19:16 - that's interesting bro yeah really cool
19:18 - and then we got you know citation of it
19:19 - because
19:20 - you use it juno says use it to teach
19:22 - code to others
19:24 - yeah that's true that's good too yeah
19:26 - that's actually that's
19:28 - that's really smart bro i mean we don't
19:29 - have access but like as soon as it has
19:31 - public
19:31 - we have public access to it then yeah
19:33 - that's that's a really cool application
19:35 - and frank is like if frank was like if
19:36 - it helps with bulletpeco we can add more
19:38 - value with the business logic and ui
19:40 - exactly
19:41 - there you go yeah like do the human
19:42 - level stuff that the ai can't quite do
19:44 - yet
19:44 - we can take care of all that yeah but
19:46 - yeah let's just go through a couple more
19:48 - of these bro because this is
19:48 - mind-blowing like i haven't even seen
19:50 - all of these i just like skimmed through
19:51 - a few of them
19:52 - but here here's this one um what does he
19:55 - type he says
19:56 - uh a button that says roll dice and then
19:59 - displays
19:59 - its value okay so a button
20:03 - there we go roll dice wow and it just
20:06 - and it knows to it knows it understands
20:08 - to call math.random
20:10 - what so look look look so he types in
20:13 - he types in he types in a button that
20:15 - rolls the dice and displays its value so
20:17 - how does it know that roll dice needs
20:18 - random
20:19 - like you see what i mean like it
20:21 - associated roll dice with random
20:23 - no and then called the random function
20:25 - like it makes these connections through
20:27 - machine learning
20:29 - narendra thanks so much for the donation
20:32 - uh yes donation
20:35 - it says you guys are awesome ocean of
20:37 - knowledge of course i appreciate your
20:38 - donation
20:39 - very very much narendra thanks narendra
20:42 - appreciate it and you get yourself a
20:43 - really cool sound effect
20:44 - yeah there you go yeah awesome
20:48 - super chat yeah the super chat yeah
20:51 - okay let's keep going so here the roll
20:53 - dice i think he adds something to it
20:55 - he says so he rolled dice display a
20:57 - value as dice
21:00 - and then one two zero to a hundred so a
21:02 - hundred sided die
21:03 - okay a header that says a button
21:06 - welcome to gpt dungeon and dragons dnd
21:12 - then a button that says uh it takes a
21:15 - little bit because you're
21:16 - accessing the api and it's running it's
21:18 - computing doing whatever crunching so
21:20 - welcome to gpt
21:21 - dnd damn man
21:25 - wow insane stuff guys that is a single
21:28 - mind
21:29 - not a single bug in the code now explain
21:31 - why there's not a single bug
21:32 - later i mean why we think there's not i
21:34 - mean we technically don't know how it
21:36 - works like only they know how it works
21:37 - exactly
21:38 - but we kind of have like speculations if
21:39 - we can kind of like interpolate
21:41 - exactly what's happening but let's just
21:42 - keep going for a little bit more okay
21:44 - next one let's just like blow people's
21:45 - minds in my mind too so an input that
21:47 - says
21:48 - go ahead enter okay where do you saw
21:49 - this one this is the to-do list one okay
21:51 - uh
21:52 - next let's go to here an input that says
21:56 - uh that says enter to do we just okay
22:00 - this is duplicate post is like can we
22:03 - create an ai with an ai
22:06 - um yeah so what we're going to do is
22:07 - we're going to add gpt 3 to code gpt 4
22:10 - and then no way what it's like gpt3 can
22:14 - you code up gpt for that
22:16 - no way i mean that wouldn't it doesn't
22:18 - look like that there's limitations we'll
22:20 - go over later too okay of this like
22:21 - there are a lot of limitations like
22:23 - actually like inherently in it
22:25 - um and i'll explain like that stuff like
22:27 - i actually go into like some of the ai
22:28 - theory later but i just still i'm just
22:29 - like fan going over this look at this
22:31 - what is this
22:31 - okay so a button that says add three
22:34 - dollars a button that says withdraw five
22:35 - dollars and show me my balance
22:37 - so it's doing some math i add three
22:39 - buttons in the button and withdraw five
22:40 - dollars and show wait why is it says at
22:42 - three dollars but it's withdrawing five
22:43 - dollars
22:44 - it's like it's like a little banking app
22:46 - so he says if you look here okay
22:48 - if you look here it says is there a way
22:50 - i can annotate oh yeah there we go so
22:52 - if you look right here it says a button
22:53 - that says add three dollars and a button
22:55 - that says withdraw five then show me the
22:57 - balance so it's just like a little
22:59 - um like a little uh banking app so
23:03 - there you go it says uh add three
23:05 - dollars and withdraw five so those are
23:06 - two buttons but what the cool thing here
23:08 - is
23:09 - it understood that withdrawal needs the
23:10 - minus operation in math
23:12 - like it made that connection you know
23:14 - it's like like it knows all this [ __ ]
23:16 - like i mean like what like
23:20 - oh this is some black black black black
23:23 - blocks magic out here like black look
23:25 - then he adds more to it what does he add
23:26 - here i didn't see this part
23:27 - and a button that says give me all my
23:29 - money and show me my balance
23:32 - give me all my money yo give oh give
23:35 - away all my money
23:36 - just like resets it so it understood
23:37 - give away all my money
23:39 - okay so it it said okay give away all my
23:42 - money means make the balance zero
23:44 - like okay like it understands this [ __ ]
23:47 - why would you want to give away all your
23:48 - money
23:49 - i mean i don't bro like come on man
23:53 - stop being so practical it's just it's
23:54 - it's blowing my mind like don't you
23:56 - think
23:56 - i'm trying to be practical out here oh
23:59 - my god
23:59 - okay what else is here what else the
24:01 - button that says
24:02 - we just saw this [ __ ] dude come on uh
24:07 - here another one so the google oh this
24:10 - is the one the first one i saw this is
24:11 - when i heard about it
24:13 - uh it says describe a layout the google
24:15 - logo a search box and two light grey
24:17 - buttons
24:18 - okay that say search google and i'm
24:20 - feeling lucky so the google home page
24:22 - okay
24:24 - eight accessing api accessing ap oh
24:27 - wait what oh no i paused the video
24:30 - accessing api
24:31 - and boom no
24:34 - it created a google clone created a
24:37 - google chrome
24:38 - react html not even react html google
24:41 - clone
24:42 - and two seconds what's up sonny what's
24:44 - up
24:59 - job is gonna get replaced soon he's the
25:00 - clone maker like oh my god like isn't
25:03 - that
25:03 - mind-blowing i mean there's more look
25:04 - there's even more but i'm not gonna
25:07 - i'm not gonna go through all them like
25:08 - i'll just let you guys go yourself
25:11 - um i'll link this in the description um
25:14 - obviously i just look up this guy sharif
25:16 - shamim on twitter just find his twitter
25:18 - good to go but let's get back to the
25:20 - presentation because i want to
25:22 - kind of have it that's what it can do
25:25 - this ai can literally code whatever you
25:27 - tell it like you literally just talk to
25:29 - it like a human
25:30 - and then it understands what you're
25:31 - saying only works in english right now i
25:33 - believe
25:34 - um and then and it does what it says
25:38 - yeah like what you say like again my
25:41 - uncle jackie chan
25:43 - uncle i'm cool crazy yeah
25:46 - you wish yo you're being racist you wish
25:48 - she was your uncle jackie chan
25:50 - this right now i'm not being racist no
25:52 - i'm just saying
25:53 - i'm just saying the truth out here man
25:56 - all right god i got it okay well so
26:00 - so um actually um it's not even just for
26:03 - code
26:03 - this thing can actually do anything text
26:06 - based
26:06 - so it's not even like it can actually
26:08 - write poems it can talk to itself
26:10 - it can do everything siri and alexa um
26:14 - text space i mean it'd be very simple yo
26:17 - my man silence your phone sorry um but
26:20 - it can it can literally as long as you
26:21 - can like
26:22 - voice out what the text is saying you
26:24 - can actually turn this into like a siri
26:25 - alexa that's way better just by having
26:27 - it speak it doesn't speak it is only
26:28 - text space but
26:29 - it's very simple to go from text to
26:30 - speech because that's what alexa and
26:32 - siri does
26:33 - um yeah like i said it's a much smarter
26:35 - siri or alexa
26:37 - so why don't we go over a couple of
26:38 - those things like okay
26:40 - uh or or here here here let's go to this
26:42 - one first so
26:43 - i don't know if you guys can even read
26:45 - this it might be too small um yeah
26:47 - they can read it guys they can read it
26:48 - i'm sure they can't get it so what this
26:50 - is is this is the um this is gpt 3
26:54 - talking to itself
26:54 - by the way guys 400 likes right now
26:58 - on this video that is epic we have 400
27:01 - likes
27:01 - we have four almost 500 people watching
27:04 - let's go guys keep hitting that like
27:07 - button smash it more as much as you can
27:09 - but anyways just keep going
27:10 - actually before i show you this it makes
27:12 - more sense so i found this other article
27:14 - here from the verge okay so um a college
27:16 - student at berkeley
27:18 - he was able to get um one of the phd
27:20 - students there like he couldn't get
27:21 - access to gpt himself when it came out
27:23 - like you try to you have to like again
27:24 - you have to go to the wait list here
27:26 - and then you have to like get in and
27:27 - blah blah blah they only let a few
27:28 - people in
27:29 - uh but a phd student at berkeley
27:31 - actually got access they got approved to
27:33 - use it
27:33 - and this other college student at
27:34 - berkeley was like yo like let me use it
27:36 - i want to do this thing so what he did
27:37 - is
27:38 - he used gbt to write fake blog posts
27:42 - yes he created a fake blog like legit
27:44 - and like no when i show you it it
27:46 - literally looks like a human wrote it
27:47 - it's like it's original writing it's
27:49 - 100 original writing that has never
27:51 - existed on the internet before
27:52 - it wrote [ __ ] and then it's coherent
27:54 - like it makes sense it's
27:56 - crazy okay do we have any examples uh
27:58 - yeah i'm going
27:59 - so going through here he wants he said
28:01 - he just wanted to prove that yeah i
28:02 - could pass as a human writer
28:03 - okay um so uh yeah if you guys didn't
28:06 - know
28:07 - if something can pass as a human if a
28:08 - computer can fool a human to thinking
28:10 - it's a human
28:11 - then it passed something called the
28:12 - turing test uh which is based on alan
28:14 - turing who actually entered the first
28:15 - computer in world war ii
28:17 - a little bit history there uh so past
28:19 - the turing test then
28:20 - then it basically says okay this
28:21 - computer is um
28:23 - intelligent enough to pass the turing
28:25 - test so like that's what he's trying to
28:26 - do here
28:27 - so the the dude's name is liam poor okay
28:30 - something about mit
28:31 - i don't know something's uh lovable but
28:33 - anyways here
28:34 - uh his here's the blog post here's the
28:36 - actual blog post okay
28:38 - this is one of the first blog posts um
28:41 - here's a sample uh so he what he did is
28:44 - he gave him the title
28:45 - and then it wrote it wrote the blog post
28:47 - so he said the way the way this ai works
28:49 - is you give it some seed text
28:51 - and then from there it interpolates what
28:53 - comes after it's like you know what i
28:54 - mean by
28:54 - text what does seed text mean so for and
28:57 - see like he seeded something so in this
28:59 - case he seated the title so the title is
29:01 - feeling unproductive maybe you should
29:02 - stop overthinking
29:03 - he gave the ai this and then i wrote a
29:06 - blog post here let me read some of you
29:07 - too so he literally gave it he gave it
29:09 - this
29:09 - he gave it this feeling unproductive
29:11 - maybe should stop overthinking it got
29:12 - the picture
29:13 - it got the picture okay and then here
29:16 - let me start reading what the ai wrote
29:19 - okay in order to get something done
29:21 - maybe we need to think less
29:22 - seems counter-intuitive but i believe
29:24 - sometimes our thoughts can get in the
29:25 - way of the creative process
29:26 - we can work better at times when we tune
29:28 - out the external world and focus on
29:29 - what's in front of us
29:30 - i've been thinking about this lately so
29:32 - i thought it would be good to write an
29:33 - article about it
29:34 - so what exactly does this mean well for
29:36 - starters let's start with some
29:37 - definitions and then it actually has
29:38 - like two structured definitions here
29:39 - definition one
29:40 - creative thinking is the act of using
29:42 - your mind to come up with ideas that are
29:43 - not already present in the reality or
29:45 - that you have never existed before or is
29:46 - it
29:47 - like look how long this is holy
29:50 - the possibilities are endless the
29:52 - important thing is to keep an open mind
29:53 - and try new things don't just limit
29:54 - yourself to one form of creative
29:56 - thinking
29:56 - expand your mind and explore all the
29:58 - possibilities that are out there i wish
29:59 - you the best of luck on your journey i
30:00 - hope that your achievement will
30:02 - achieve all of your dreams fit and even
30:04 - it even stole this because a lot of
30:05 - bloggers use finn
30:06 - as like finished so it learned that from
30:08 - other bloggers
30:09 - and then it it now understands how to
30:12 - write blogs so bloggers you lost all
30:13 - your jobs too it's not just us coders
30:15 - um all authors uh jk rowling you know
30:18 - harry potter you're screwed
30:19 - wow it can it can even write poetry it
30:22 - can write poetry and write knowledge
30:24 - guys you're gonna write like they can
30:25 - write anything
30:27 - it's like what's it honestly i'm
30:29 - speechless right now man
30:31 - i am legitimately speechless right now
30:33 - it wasn't copy and pasting like little
30:35 - things from the internet it literally
30:36 - wrote everything word by word
30:38 - through machine learning literally
30:40 - everything word by word just like the
30:41 - code it literally wrote each line of
30:43 - code
30:43 - and this sounds variable by variable
30:45 - line by line semicolon by semicolon
30:48 - literally understand all it's doing is
30:51 - saying okay if i have this like um
30:53 - here's one example of
30:54 - when i was looking into it about how it
30:55 - worked it says when it sees the word
30:58 - fire
30:59 - okay it's more likely to be followed by
31:01 - truck
31:03 - because fire truck then it is to um
31:07 - fire the beef to be followed by fan so
31:09 - like fire truck is more likely than fire
31:11 - fan because fire fan isn't a thing it
31:13 - doesn't exist
31:14 - uh as you can see right here i think
31:15 - this is where it was it says
31:17 - uh yeah so like fire truck and fire
31:19 - alarm are much more likely than fire
31:20 - lucid or fire elvish which makes sense
31:23 - it's just like a very basic machine
31:24 - learning principle but they just
31:26 - basically
31:27 - made this thing so they trained it so so
31:29 - deeply i might explain why it's so
31:31 - powerful
31:32 - um they just give it so much of this
31:33 - predictive ability that it can
31:35 - now it can do any arbitrary text based
31:37 - processing and they can actually speak
31:39 - and pass as a human which is as a
31:42 - developer
31:43 - as a blog post writer as a [ __ ] poet
31:45 - it can pass
31:46 - that human it doesn't matter what it is
31:48 - no like this is one step
31:49 - this is one step towards uh getting
31:51 - closer to the general intelligence of
31:53 - like being able
31:54 - so that's what i always thought so
31:56 - interestingly i've always
31:57 - that's what that's what i've always
31:59 - thought that things can be a little bit
32:00 - different
32:02 - i don't know what to say i don't know
32:03 - what to say man elon musk was right bro
32:06 - he's right to be scared about yeah he's
32:08 - gonna take all our jobs in our lives
32:09 - he was scared remember i don't know if
32:11 - you guys remember but remember that uh
32:13 - when uh with the whole thing when he
32:15 - came up with the ai or
32:17 - some kind of ai and he released it but
32:20 - then he was like
32:20 - he's like yeah ai is scary we need to
32:23 - really look after this and really to
32:24 - look at what's going on
32:26 - because this this stuff can get really
32:29 - dangerous
32:30 - through time and so i've always thought
32:33 - personally i mean i mean watermelon
32:35 - buttons but like okay go ahead
32:40 - okay watermelon butts i'm not gonna do
32:42 - anything
32:43 - but that's what you think bro but
32:46 - that's the blog the blogging
32:50 - yeah that is some crazy [ __ ] yeah you
32:53 - could even like train it like
32:54 - to have like a writer like in somebody's
32:56 - voice and then you could like do like
32:58 - you know how like they have like
32:59 - machine learning like like deep fake
33:00 - video content and you can like fake
33:02 - their voice fake the video
33:03 - um that and now they can fix the writing
33:05 - so like you can literally completely
33:06 - impersonate somebody and capture their
33:08 - personality
33:09 - and everything the way they look the way
33:10 - they sound the way they write
33:12 - and then like use machine learning to
33:13 - like completely represent that person
33:15 - and create content
33:16 - after that person is dead so we could
33:17 - literally we could literally bring
33:19 - shakespeare back to life
33:20 - like we could have his face have
33:22 - everything and just have him write like
33:23 - shakespeare from learning learning from
33:25 - his previous wow wow
33:28 - you know what's funny somebody said like
33:30 - tic tacs like hey you're both faces
33:32 - match 80
33:32 - similar and like i'm not sure how
33:34 - similar our faces are but
33:38 - that's pretty funny but in any case like
33:39 - what what i've always thought but i will
33:41 - always say
33:42 - okay we're both handsome dudes not like
33:43 - everybody i know
33:48 - by the way so i've always thought by the
33:49 - way guys 484 likes guys let's get that
33:52 - fight to 500 come on keep it going keep
33:54 - it going help us out out here
33:55 - so what i always thought that's what i
33:57 - was you know delivered or
33:59 - changed kind of about um about
34:02 - what's it called that's always thought
34:05 - about
34:06 - like ai right i think hey ei yes it can
34:08 - re
34:09 - do repeatable things but i always
34:11 - thought that in terms of creativity
34:13 - create creative work that would be up to
34:15 - us
34:16 - but i that seems like i'm wrong on here
34:20 - because the creative process here on
34:23 - this block is just so
34:24 - good like yeah let us know guys do you
34:27 - what do you think about this blog that
34:28 - was actually a very well
34:30 - written block like i would read that
34:32 - gary right i would read that
34:34 - yeah right like it's like it's it's it's
34:37 - basically
34:39 - it's cool be okay so let me explain
34:42 - let's just continue in the
34:43 - presentation and then i'm gonna make
34:44 - some addendums to that so i wrote that
34:46 - blog post
34:46 - but here's another thing here's gpt
34:49 - talking to itself
34:50 - so they they just had it and they just
34:52 - keep feeding the messages back to each
34:53 - other and now it's conversating with
34:55 - itself so let me read this out
34:56 - so let's start so gpt gpt
34:59 - uh chat person one uh you can or person
35:02 - one you can talk about all these human
35:04 - beings that are greedy
35:05 - and you can talk about how the stock
35:07 - market is a system of corruption
35:08 - but that's a failure of the human
35:09 - experience and then um then it counters
35:12 - with artificial intelligence has no
35:13 - greed
35:14 - it's an advantage over humans it's able
35:15 - to generate wealth
35:17 - wow in response ai will always be at the
35:19 - advantage over human beings
35:21 - and then it responds ai has no emotions
35:23 - no agree so like one is like fighting
35:24 - for ai and the other one's defending ai
35:26 - so it's kind of creepy
35:27 - like it's dependent stance like ai has
35:30 - no greed it's an intelligent algorithm
35:31 - humans are too emotional but then it
35:33 - flips so now both sides are
35:35 - like fighting they want to hold on to
35:37 - something they want to hold on to their
35:38 - money but they don't want to invest
35:39 - talking [ __ ] about humans that's where
35:41 - human beings fail because they can't see
35:43 - the future they can't understand the way
35:44 - the world really
35:45 - what it's very dangerous for a human
35:47 - being to try to predict the future
35:49 - because you don't really know how the
35:50 - world works
35:51 - but it but in a i can see the future it
35:54 - can predict the future it can create an
35:55 - optimal future
35:58 - that's literally the conversation it had
36:00 - with itself
36:01 - it's kind of creepy like it like like
36:03 - where did this come from
36:04 - i mean honestly like it's probably it's
36:06 - probably learning because a lot of
36:07 - people like talk about these topics so
36:08 - probably learned like when you're
36:09 - talking about ai go down this route of
36:11 - ai is dangerous and that's why it sounds
36:13 - like
36:13 - ai is being dangerous it's like it's not
36:15 - this isn't sentient i just want to be
36:16 - very very clear
36:17 - this ai is not a sentient ai it's not
36:19 - like it's not actually
36:21 - an ai it's just a very very clever kind
36:23 - of text predictor and
36:25 - um understanding where i can spit out
36:26 - arbitrary text in any way and understand
36:28 - it
36:29 - but it doesn't actually okay so i just
36:31 - want to retract this back
36:32 - so guys i don't know if you know but so
36:34 - this was written this was this chat was
36:36 - written by ai
36:38 - yeah between two ei or with just one ei
36:41 - the same gp just two
36:42 - copies of gpt three two cause and
36:44 - they're both talking to each other
36:47 - in a creepy kind of way like it's kind
36:49 - of creepy when you like they're talking
36:51 - about like how
36:51 - ai has emotions there's no greedy
36:53 - there's no greed yeah it's not being
36:55 - greedy
36:55 - humans are too emotional this is where
36:57 - human beings fail
36:59 - like though the end is coming guys the
37:01 - apocalypse is coming
37:02 - this is why this is this this is what
37:04 - i'm saying i don't like this this is why
37:05 - we gotta be careful this stuff
37:06 - because i know man i mean if they're
37:08 - already talking about how the human
37:09 - beings are not perfect how they i mean i
37:11 - mean we're not perfect but
37:12 - like humans are too emotional they're
37:14 - they've got something
37:15 - they've got i know bro like all this
37:17 - exists so when ai
37:18 - is smart enough it can go back into
37:20 - history on the internet and find all
37:21 - this information and stuff
37:22 - wow so let's just pray that all the
37:25 - green lights like you know on my laptop
37:26 - right now the webcam is going it has a
37:27 - little green light let's just pray it
37:28 - stays green because when it turns red
37:30 - we're [ __ ]
37:32 - but that [ __ ] turns great it's like from
37:34 - the eye roll by you know what i'm
37:34 - talking about from the eye roblox
37:36 - exactly i robot just make sure just make
37:38 - sure you know like wally you know you
37:39 - think he's nice until the light turns
37:40 - red and then you're screwed
37:45 - said elon is part of clever programmer
37:47 - maybe you don't know that
37:49 - maybe maybe maybe i'm elon
37:52 - maybe aaron is young i don't know
37:57 - maybe we're ai i don't know i don't know
38:01 - yeah i mean i guess you can abstract
38:04 - that bro to like some level because like
38:06 - like the the idea behind ai's
38:08 - unconsciousness is like if if you guys
38:10 - have uh heard of girdle escher bach
38:12 - um this guy was kind of like he's he was
38:14 - a cognitive scientist which is like a
38:16 - branch of artificial intelligence or
38:17 - kind of like a sub
38:18 - or a super branch or super super super
38:20 - set of it
38:21 - okay about um how
38:24 - like brains come to be conscious because
38:26 - like the earth was just freaking rocks
38:28 - at one point in lava yeah how do we go
38:29 - from lava to humans like when was the
38:31 - first
38:32 - cell like when was the very first
38:33 - creature that came from just the rocks
38:35 - and like the nitrogen and the water and
38:36 - everything right and then like every
38:38 - single step from that point all the way
38:39 - up to humans
38:40 - at one point did consciousness come so
38:41 - this book goes over like how um how that
38:44 - process came to be going from
38:45 - rocks up to the first cells up to the
38:47 - smallest things at every step
38:49 - up into humans and like okay because
38:51 - we're humans we're conscious
38:53 - but the idea is that consciousness is a
38:55 - is a thing it's like a loop
38:57 - it's not it's not like like we we are
38:59 - not ourselves actually because
39:01 - um every seven years every cell in your
39:03 - body dies
39:04 - and changes out so seven years ago you
39:06 - were 100 a different person you were
39:08 - made up of different cells seven years
39:10 - ago
39:11 - seven years in the future you'll be made
39:12 - up of completely different cells in your
39:14 - body every single cell in your body will
39:15 - become 100
39:16 - different well i mean we got cells we
39:18 - generally everything can type every
39:19 - every
39:20 - time which which means that we are not
39:22 - actually the cells that make us up we're
39:23 - just the pattern of the things going on
39:25 - in our brains we're just the pattern of
39:26 - data going through our brains in some
39:28 - kind of structure
39:29 - we're not actually our bodies or our
39:31 - bodies don't actually matter which means
39:32 - you can actually
39:33 - theoretically implant your same like you
39:36 - know patterns and stuff in your brain
39:37 - into a different body
39:38 - a clone and it could still be you you
39:40 - can they would still think
39:42 - it's you yeah there'd just be two of you
39:43 - because you're not actually your body
39:45 - but um
39:45 - so the idea is that they tie that to
39:47 - artificial intelligence because you
39:48 - don't need
39:49 - you don't need a computer it's just some
39:50 - kind of like um
39:52 - connection of uh connection of of things
39:55 - like
39:56 - it's like a brain like like a network so
39:58 - some people like to argue that the
39:59 - internet is actually conscious because
40:01 - there's so many different connections
40:02 - and stuff
40:02 - and it's like it can think on its own
40:04 - which i think is kind of bs but
40:06 - yeah i mean it's just like
40:09 - i mean i mean honestly here's the i know
40:11 - have you guys ever heard of uh so what's
40:13 - a
40:13 - really interesting essay have you heard
40:15 - of have you seen um
40:17 - so elon musk went on went on to an
40:20 - interview not interview but
40:22 - podcast a joe rogan podcast right oh
40:24 - yeah
40:25 - and and there he talked about he talked
40:28 - about how
40:29 - they already have a chip a chip a
40:32 - girl yeah you're like a chip that will
40:35 - actually and
40:35 - hold on listen to this it will actually
40:39 - go ahead and it can fix any problems you
40:42 - got
40:43 - so for example let in your brain so
40:46 - let's say for example
40:47 - you have for example like adhd it can
40:49 - fix that
40:50 - let's say for example you're deaf and
40:52 - you can't hear it can fix that
40:54 - let's say for example you can't walk
40:56 - right it can fix
40:57 - your legs if you're paraplegic you can't
40:59 - use your legs
41:01 - it will bring all those connections back
41:03 - which is just simply
41:05 - mind freaking blown man right
41:08 - yeah yeah it does it by i think it says
41:11 - like all he does is like you have like a
41:12 - little quarter sized chip on your skull
41:14 - yeah yeah yeah they will actually
41:16 - implant like a chip like they'll
41:17 - actually like cut up
41:18 - the skull no no it's like yeah they call
41:21 - the little hole in the skull right they
41:22 - put like a little chip there they put a
41:23 - chip in there
41:24 - and then they have wires going into the
41:26 - brain no no no no no wires no knife no
41:28 - wires nope no wires no those wires bro i
41:31 - know this is the podcast
41:32 - okay everybody everybody go watch the
41:35 - joe rogan
41:36 - um elon musk's podcast the most recent
41:38 - one and go find out that elon musk does
41:40 - mention wires going into the brain and
41:41 - come back to this comment section and
41:43 - prove that's wrong all right and
41:44 - prove me wrong i'll check tomorrow
41:50 - he said literally they have wires going
41:52 - in the brain to the exact perfect spot
41:54 - in the brain whatever problem you have
41:55 - like if you're blind go to the visual
41:56 - cortex if you're
41:57 - um go to your motor system place
41:59 - wherever i don't know what this or if
42:00 - you have memory issues if you have
42:02 - alzheimer's go to the hippocampus for
42:03 - your memory
42:04 - and then you just put wires and then you
42:06 - have a little node there it goes to the
42:07 - perfect spot
42:08 - and then you just you just have counter
42:09 - pulses or like people with epilepsy
42:11 - right
42:13 - um same thing then you can like give
42:14 - counter pulses to like prevent a seizure
42:16 - from coming because you can you can
42:17 - sense it come and get the right spot
42:19 - and then stuff like that so you can like
42:21 - actually put it into your brain
42:22 - so that's kind of scary because with ai
42:24 - together now ai can actually start
42:26 - manipulating our brains if we have these
42:27 - like in our freaking yeah
42:29 - they can actually make it it can make
42:31 - you smarter right right you know it can
42:33 - make aaron you know
42:34 - you know faster if he wants to run
42:36 - faster i don't know no
42:37 - no i'm the exception it's not possible
42:39 - but oh it's not possible to make you
42:41 - faster
42:42 - no no no i'm already i'm already the
42:44 - fastest bro oh yeah that's what you
42:46 - think i'm like the flash
42:47 - oh yeah guys we're going to have a we're
42:49 - going to have it bro
42:51 - let's get back to gpt3 because we're
42:53 - going to do it coding yeah
42:55 - this is this is very interesting this is
42:56 - just very interesting i think right it
42:58 - is it's interesting yeah
42:59 - it's just a casual life but anyways
43:03 - let's continue on so uh yeah like i said
43:05 - unfortunately the code isn't publicly
43:06 - available i tried to get access but i
43:08 - couldn't
43:09 - a few people did yeah for free of misuse
43:11 - so
43:12 - everybody knows uh elon doesn't like ai
43:14 - he's kind of scared of it that's why he
43:15 - founded opening iron but now he created
43:17 - this because he was scared of ai so
43:19 - there's kind of a dichotomy there like
43:22 - it's kind of paradoxical but
43:24 - more contradicting but yeah you hear uh
43:26 - it's quote elon musk
43:27 - with artificial intelligence we are
43:29 - summoning the demon
43:33 - wow but uh yeah like if you check it out
43:35 - um this is open ai
43:37 - and then to request access you you go to
43:39 - the waitlist i'll pop this in here if
43:41 - you guys want to see if you can get
43:42 - access maybe somebody actually will
43:43 - i don't know what i don't know their
43:44 - criteria will we have the link to this
43:46 - stuff
43:48 - yeah it's not in the description yet but
43:49 - after the stream is done i'll pop it all
43:51 - in there
43:51 - i'm not gonna do it now yeah so guys so
43:53 - after the stream is done we'll make sure
43:54 - to put the link in description okay so
43:55 - you guys can check this stuff out all
43:57 - this stuff
43:57 - every single video the twitter
43:59 - everything yeah um but let's just keep
44:01 - going on the presentation so
44:03 - yep so i don't have access to the code
44:05 - so that's why i'm limited to showing you
44:06 - these videos and the twitter clips and
44:07 - everything just because i want to
44:08 - showcase the power we're just kind of
44:09 - like riffing on it and talking but i
44:11 - can't give you a live demo unfortunately
44:14 - um maybe in the future when it if we if
44:16 - it does go public that'll be awesome
44:18 - maybe we can make a cool video on it
44:19 - like actually like like pushing the
44:20 - limits and be like hey sonny you're
44:22 - about to lose your job
44:23 - but uh or wait maybe we just make our
44:25 - own you know
44:27 - yo so i want to talk about how this
44:28 - actually works so
44:30 - apparently um this thing ate the entire
44:33 - internet like literally
44:34 - like like a freaking sandwich okay so
44:36 - the gbt3
44:38 - literally what it did is it went through
44:39 - literally all the text publicly
44:41 - available on the entire freaking
44:42 - internet
44:43 - everything and it ate it it just [ __ ]
44:45 - ate it
44:46 - like it ate it like i consumed it so
44:48 - wikipedia everything every single
44:50 - wikipedia page
44:50 - eaten every single search eats it every
44:53 - single scholarly paper
44:55 - every single piece of code on github
44:57 - that is publicly available eating
44:58 - the entire internet it ate everything
45:01 - okay
45:02 - okay why do you say eat
45:08 - it read and processed everything and
45:09 - used all that data as its training data
45:12 - for me
45:13 - so that's why it's so robust in its
45:15 - writing because it's literally read
45:16 - every piece of text that exists on the
45:18 - internet so it can actually understand
45:20 - what coherent text means what coherent
45:22 - code is because it's read all of it
45:24 - and can see the patterns so it can be
45:26 - like okay um
45:29 - the likelihood of following x like if
45:31 - like in code you know like we could like
45:33 - x equals five
45:34 - like it could say okay for x um usually
45:37 - after x and
45:38 - since it's such a common variable name
45:39 - the chance of equal sign following it is
45:41 - pretty high
45:42 - so it might put a sign and then after
45:44 - that it's like okay a number is pretty
45:46 - likely so
45:47 - x equals three or something like that
45:48 - and it just goes through everything and
45:50 - it just learned
45:51 - and it this took like a long long time
45:53 - and a lot of computation power
45:55 - to do um i'll mention how they did they
45:58 - did it in a little bit but
46:00 - basically it it everything dude ate
46:02 - [ __ ] everything
46:03 - wow like like patrick wow dude that that
46:07 - that's insane to me but okay when you
46:08 - okay when you guys just so you know when
46:10 - he says eat
46:11 - it did you literally just eat like what
46:13 - i'm eating right now
46:14 - but it's so funny somebody just
46:15 - mentioned you know i used to not do
46:17 - something you mentioned the kind of like
46:18 - are you snacking i'm like yes i am
46:22 - but anyways so what literally happened
46:25 - is
46:26 - it didn't eat but basically it just it
46:27 - engulfed it downloaded all the
46:29 - information
46:30 - and then learned a used information as
46:32 - training data
46:33 - because in ai when you for example you
46:36 - know the way
46:36 - the way ai works is from real world
46:39 - experiences just like we humans
46:41 - learn from real world experiences right
46:43 - you know our brain brain at the end of
46:45 - the day is just a very complex ai system
46:48 - it's a very complexity system and it
46:49 - learns from experiences from seeing
46:51 - different things and so forth
46:52 - and so the same thing happened with this
46:54 - specific application where literally you
46:56 - just you know engulfed
46:57 - everything onto the internet the blogs
46:59 - everything and i said you know
47:01 - what i got a system that can build
47:03 - applications
47:04 - write blogs next thing you know can be
47:06 - created
47:07 - can talk it got all the chat the public
47:10 - chats available and now can chat with
47:11 - itself about any topic
47:14 - and so at some point
47:17 - at some point i'm meeting her now at
47:20 - some point
47:21 - this will also be yeah patrick yeah
47:23 - patrick
47:26 - this is me right here no right here
47:28 - right here
47:30 - okay actually actually wait one second
47:32 - what
47:35 - i'm not
47:38 - there we go there's an odds right there
47:41 - guys
47:42 - this is a homemade meme i had to pop the
47:44 - text under myself oh my god it's funny
47:46 - homemade beans are the best ones oh yeah
47:48 - oh yeah oh yeah
47:57 - i don't know what that means but it's
47:58 - crazy and when i say the whole internet
48:00 - like you guys would be surprised how
48:01 - much data that actually is let's get
48:02 - into that next
48:03 - so the whole internet that's everything
48:06 - you can find on google
48:08 - and then some so read this read this and
48:09 - this is from 2017 so this is even like
48:12 - it says google does not hold the biggest
48:15 - of data centers
48:17 - but it still handles a huge amount of
48:18 - data so google isn't even the majority
48:20 - of the internet like the whole dark web
48:21 - and everything there's a lot of servers
48:22 - that aren't on google that can't be
48:23 - accessed by google that aren't popped up
48:25 - by searching okay
48:26 - so a lot of people think google and
48:28 - internet is the same because you can
48:29 - find everything on google that is not
48:30 - true
48:31 - yeah um so uh it
48:34 - knows every every possible thing you can
48:36 - find on google it it is in there it ate
48:38 - all of that
48:38 - wow and then and then it ate a [ __ ] ton
48:41 - more wow
48:42 - like that's how much data it went
48:44 - through is what i'm saying like this
48:45 - this is this is like
48:46 - most cutting edge state-of-the-art this
48:48 - is the biggest ai thing machine learning
48:50 - project i think
48:50 - anybody has ever done ever um it's it's
48:53 - crazy so
48:54 - uh data center here this is what the
48:56 - data centers at google probably look
48:57 - like they're like big super databases of
48:59 - like
48:59 - just like terabytes after terabyte
49:02 - terabyte
49:03 - and uh it says the data center normally
49:04 - holds petabytes to exabytes of data
49:07 - i think petabytes petabytes after yeah i
49:09 - think petabytes
49:11 - that's like a thousand that's like a
49:12 - thousand terabytes yeah and then
49:14 - exabytes is a thousand x petabytes so
49:17 - that's a million terabytes one exabyte
49:19 - is a million terabytes
49:21 - of data wow so google currently
49:23 - processes over 20 petabytes
49:25 - petabytes of data per day through an
49:28 - average of 100
49:30 - 000 mapreduce jobs spread across its
49:32 - massive competing clusters so
49:33 - mapreduce is just a way to um crunch
49:35 - data and you kind of like run
49:37 - run number crunch and then you find out
49:39 - what you want because like when you
49:40 - search a term how does it search all of
49:42 - that data to find your search results
49:43 - that's what's happening with mapreduce
49:44 - so we're not going to go into the output
49:45 - but
49:47 - basically a [ __ ] ton of information of
49:49 - data is there and this is just google so
49:51 - it ate everything
49:52 - plus more wow so it's ridiculous wow so
49:55 - gpt 3 has actually it knows everything
49:57 - on the internet everything
49:59 - everything um so yeah i also want to
50:02 - talk about
50:02 - uh gpt itself the reason why this is so
50:04 - groundbreaking is gpt uh just to quote
50:06 - aaron
50:07 - uh about two hours ago
50:10 - gpt shits on everything else so far
50:15 - aaron aaron bernath elon's son
50:18 - but yeah jackie chan's nephew
50:22 - yeah if you like jackie chan uh
50:29 - have chinese halfway but anyway anyways
50:32 - um here this is a graph of each one of
50:34 - these is a different
50:36 - machine learning model based on text so
50:37 - a natural language processor so nlp
50:39 - stands for
50:40 - natural language processor nope not it's
50:43 - not
50:43 - neuro-linguistic programming that's
50:45 - another thing don't get it confused with
50:46 - neural
50:47 - linguistic programming that's a social
50:48 - kind of thing about how your brain
50:50 - learns through repetition
50:51 - this is natural language processing
50:53 - different um
50:54 - so and these are pre-trained models in
50:56 - in the sense that they
50:58 - were trained with machine learning and
50:59 - then now we can just like pass
51:01 - stuff through it and then it can just
51:02 - like use those uh learned numbers to
51:04 - actually spit out stuff
51:06 - so as you can see here um i don't know
51:09 - when these are created but
51:10 - these are yeah this this
51:13 - um axis is in billions so the 12 million
51:17 - for example 12 million 18 million
51:19 - 66 million so yeah but uh
51:22 - the way the way uh machine learning
51:24 - works is a neural net will have a bunch
51:26 - of nodes
51:27 - okay and each of those nodes the number
51:29 - and then you just pass
51:30 - stuff through and then it can like it
51:32 - like the numbers will change things and
51:34 - then it'll eventually understand go from
51:35 - like your input to your output
51:37 - so like for example for like uh for
51:39 - images
51:40 - um you would have like when we train
51:42 - stuff if you guys in the fix detection
51:43 - app and stuff
51:44 - um it'll have the nodes and it'll have
51:46 - all the numbers in there and then when
51:47 - you pass them an image
51:48 - it'll go through all the nodes and
51:50 - numbers and at the end it'll give you a
51:51 - yes or no
51:52 - so that's the input is image the output
51:54 - is yes or no
51:55 - um if it's a face or not uh so that's
51:58 - kind of like what is like
51:59 - in each of those nodes is considered a
52:00 - parameter so gpt3
52:03 - has 175 billion parameters
52:07 - okay totally like you don't understand
52:10 - but if you look at look at the first one
52:12 - this one had a measly 12 million
52:13 - and when each of these came out
52:15 - everybody thought they were huge it's
52:16 - like you started with 12 million
52:18 - parameters like think about it a neural
52:19 - network with 12 million
52:21 - numbers like it's a list of 12 million
52:23 - numbers and each of those 12 million
52:25 - numbers is doing a little small
52:26 - calculation on the input data
52:28 - and making you one step closer to your
52:29 - output data wow so this one had 12
52:31 - million which is a [ __ ] ton
52:32 - wow and then they're like holy crap then
52:34 - they went up to 18 million then
52:36 - 66 million that was a huge jump people
52:38 - were going crazy okay
52:39 - this divert i don't know what these are
52:41 - to be honest i wasn't i don't know when
52:42 - when these happen
52:44 - uh then 110 million 125 million 340
52:47 - million
52:48 - and then eventually um then open ai came
52:50 - about and then i think a couple years
52:51 - ago
52:52 - um open ai came out with gpt-2 okay
52:55 - gpt-2 which had 1500
52:59 - 1500 million aka one 1.5 billion
53:02 - parameter and that was the biggest one
53:04 - to date because they jumped from 355
53:06 - million
53:06 - to 1.5 billion and gpt just shot on
53:09 - everybody they're like ah
53:10 - this is fine that's like five that's
53:11 - like four times more yeah
53:13 - yeah so like it was basically doing the
53:14 - same things as what we're doing is like
53:16 - natural um language processing it was
53:18 - doing like predictive techs and stuff
53:20 - like that
53:20 - got it but it was it was state of the
53:22 - art at the time i think a couple years
53:23 - ago
53:24 - and then google came out with their t5
53:26 - uh nlp pre-trained model
53:28 - which had 11 billion and they're like
53:30 - holy crap this is 10 times bigger
53:32 - okay and then microsoft came out with
53:34 - turing and lg
53:36 - um again remember the turing test is a
53:38 - test where if it can pass as a human it
53:40 - passes the turing test so they called it
53:41 - turning nlg
53:42 - appropriately that had 17 billion
53:45 - parameters which is another huge leap
53:46 - because it almost doubled the 11
53:48 - billion and then gb and open and elon
53:50 - musk was like ah
53:51 - screw you guys we're creating gp3
53:56 - literally an order of magnitude okay
53:58 - from seventeen
53:59 - 17 175 billion like this is ten times
54:03 - bigger
54:04 - like it just shot up oh and it just
54:05 - shattered everything so this
54:07 - as you can see this this is uh the
54:09 - perfect example of exponential growth
54:11 - so in other words yeah we're [ __ ] the
54:13 - robot
54:14 - in other words elon screwed us over
54:16 - that's what yolan did
54:18 - by trying to save us he's exactly he's
54:20 - he's curing global warming
54:21 - he's uh he's solving the super volcano
54:23 - and asteroid risk problem by getting us
54:25 - on mars
54:26 - but then he's also controlling us with
54:28 - artificial intelligence
54:29 - like this guy is jacked just like just
54:32 - like honestly though just like elon's
54:33 - [ __ ] and everything with the tesla
54:35 - i think you know elon's gonna [ __ ] shine
54:37 - everything with the aei honestly
54:39 - literally like yeah he's just uh he's
54:42 - such an inspirational figure like all
54:43 - the best go to him so like he has the
54:46 - ability he has the most leverage to
54:47 - build the most badass team
54:49 - yeah like more than everybody like he's
54:50 - now the fourth richest person in the
54:51 - world
54:52 - only the only people in front of him are
54:54 - bezos um gates bill gates and mark
54:57 - zuckerberg yeah so he's number four
54:59 - yeah and honestly i think he's gonna
55:01 - pass everybody he's gonna be the first
55:02 - trillionaire he's gonna be the world's
55:03 - first trillion probably
55:04 - probably probably bezos is his only real
55:07 - competition because he also has the
55:09 - space company
55:10 - yeah but even then he doesn't have a
55:12 - electric car company
55:13 - you know he doesn't have this ai company
55:15 - the same decision i mean i guess it's
55:17 - amazon so
55:18 - they have some [ __ ] but now elon is
55:19 - gonna yeah yeah
55:21 - he's gonna do some crazy stuff in the
55:22 - next 20 years by the way by the way guys
55:24 - i just want to really quickly
55:25 - point point something out here we got
55:27 - kazzy in the chat kazakh in the chat
55:29 - guys just say hi in the chat
55:30 - uh what's up you just put put in the
55:32 - chat he's like uh kazia's out here like
55:34 - yo guys uh kaza here my girlfriend has
55:37 - just dropped her first youtube video on
55:38 - working out from home
55:40 - it's epic go show some love nas push the
55:42 - vid guys
55:43 - i just sho i just saw um amber lee's
55:46 - first video on
55:47 - working out and it is insane so good
55:50 - guys it is so good
55:51 - check out the link is in bio guys drop
55:54 - the link and not bio drop the link in
56:00 - need to work out you description need to
56:02 - need to move around uh you know
56:04 - you guys need to go ahead and you know
56:06 - make sure your body is
56:07 - you know strained and is healthy and
56:10 - that's what amberly is here to do
56:12 - she's gonna keep you healthy and she's
56:14 - gonna keep you so
56:16 - so well so well i don't know how do i
56:19 - say this
56:19 - so well trained in shape in shape there
56:22 - we go
56:23 - athletic yeah yeah and i just spent
56:25 - about 10 hours of adding and
56:27 - her hearing him spent about 10 hours of
56:29 - editing this video
56:31 - shooting it and putting a lot of love
56:33 - into it guys so
56:34 - just want to say check it out it's in
56:37 - the chat
56:38 - go ahead kazi and drop it in the chat so
56:39 - that everybody can see it and then we're
56:41 - going to continue on
56:42 - with this but i just want to say as an
56:44 - epic video amberly
56:46 - awesome job and let's keep this moving
56:49 - let's go nice i was gonna i was gonna
56:51 - find it and pull it up but
56:53 - oh no i can't hold on because i
56:54 - screenshot it hold on
56:56 - hold wait let me see if i can just find
56:57 - it just looking for clever programmer
57:01 - i got it actually
57:05 - i got this yeah it's it's gone i don't
57:07 - know where it is but i got this
57:10 - hold on i got this
57:15 - boom right there i put in there as well
57:17 - all right guys nice sweet so
57:19 - okay so let's continue on with with what
57:22 - we're talking about here which
57:23 - is which is oh wait jason jason has just
57:26 - made a donation thanks so much hold on
57:28 - thank you francis jason franco
57:30 - appreciate that
57:32 - thanks so much is that a is that a good
57:34 - word or a bad word
57:35 - appreciate the work lads are just guys
57:38 - they're like
57:38 - guys you're cool lads are cool guys a
57:41 - lot lads are cool guys
57:43 - cool guy or cool guys is it plural or
57:46 - plural man
57:48 - there's an s in the end i know what it
57:50 - means but i'm just trying to trigger you
57:51 - and it worked
57:52 - anyways
57:56 - if only i can cuss in this video real
57:58 - nicely
57:59 - i mean i already did are we not allowed
58:00 - to cuss on youtube uh well i mean
58:03 - i mean we try to keep it civil sometimes
58:04 - you know sometimes we try we try
58:06 - [ __ ]
58:10 - let's keep going um but yeah so gpt
58:12 - shits on everything else so far
58:14 - gonna put the emphasis on the [ __ ] the
58:16 - [ __ ] okay let's continue let's continue
58:18 - let's continue
58:19 - let's continue well yeah um but yeah so
58:22 - pretty much going back to here
58:23 - um all of these little ones okay like 12
58:25 - million parameters all the up to even
58:27 - the 1.5 billion you could actually run
58:28 - it on your
58:29 - your own laptop like it was just barely
58:31 - strong enough to like run it you could
58:32 - run the whole thing
58:34 - um on your computer but then when you
58:36 - started getting up to these two
58:37 - questionable and then when we got to
58:39 - this big gp3 like it's impossible you
58:41 - cannot run it on your own computer you
58:42 - need some kind of cluster so you need
58:44 - like multiple
58:45 - you need multiple um multiple
58:49 - processors and uh maybe even graphics
58:52 - cards or whatever all in parallel
58:54 - running
58:54 - number crunching all the data for it's
58:55 - even work in a reasonable amount of time
58:57 - um a lot so you can even run it on like
58:59 - super computers so like huge huge
59:00 - clusters like this
59:02 - uh but yeah you just need to you need to
59:05 - run it on on
59:06 - such a big thing um which comes i mean
59:09 - like the fact that you need to run it on
59:11 - this like it costs a lot of money too
59:12 - like all the electricity and all the
59:14 - everything to run this like just to have
59:15 - this open i think exist it takes a lot
59:17 - of money and a lot of energy and a lot
59:19 - of time and a lot of compute power
59:20 - um so it kind of leads me to the idea of
59:24 - like okay so
59:25 - how the hell did it do this like how how
59:27 - were they able to literally read
59:28 - all of this stuff on the internet like
59:30 - when you touch it when you put in any
59:32 - search term on the internet there's
59:33 - literally like millions or billions of
59:34 - like results
59:36 - okay of of stuff and that's just from
59:37 - one word now i'll go over
59:39 - every single search possible and that's
59:41 - all of google and then google is only a
59:43 - subset of everything on the internet so
59:44 - how did he eat everything
59:46 - like within two years and process all of
59:48 - it and actually learn from it because
59:49 - reading it is very different from
59:50 - processing it and learning from it
59:53 - okay right so how it did this is
59:55 - something called
59:57 - transformers what
60:06 - no but seriously it's actually called
60:07 - transformers so i don't know
60:09 - too much about this to be honest but i
60:10 - did a little bit of research
60:12 - i found the wikipedia page right here uh
60:14 - it's a machine learning model so let's
60:16 - actually just pull the wikipedia page i
60:17 - have it guys
60:18 - before we look at here i just want to
60:19 - say so hash thanks so much for the
60:20 - donation
60:21 - really appreciate it man i was 40 40. i
60:24 - keep forgetting what the name of this
60:25 - but this this dollar sign is it rupees
60:28 - maybe it's rupees it's indian it's right
60:30 - rupees so it's
60:31 - appreciated thanks so much for the
60:33 - awesome donation
60:36 - jose appreciate that beautiful beach
60:39 - photo is your profile photo
60:40 - yeah i like it i know and he has to hate
60:42 - you emoji hey you
60:43 - right by the way guys 600 likes let's go
60:49 - insane stuff 600 likes we're still
60:52 - almost 400 people watching let's keep
60:54 - this going
60:55 - all right let's keep going so yeah so
60:56 - this is uh gpt3 the wikipedia article
61:00 - um i mean a lot it's very wordy i'm not
61:02 - going to read this out you can check it
61:03 - out if you want to if you guys have it
61:04 - already
61:05 - but pretty much if you go down you can
61:06 - see that um the
61:08 - way i was able to do this was it was um
61:11 - based on a new deep learning
61:12 - machine learning model introduced in
61:14 - 2017 called the transformer
61:16 - so um in 2017 uh well first of all the
61:19 - transformer movie came out in 2017 so
61:21 - that's that's a fun fact though
61:23 - revenge of the fallen um but no there's
61:26 - a thing called a transformer
61:28 - a machine learning model in 2017 that
61:30 - they developed and i'll i already looked
61:32 - into it and i researched a little bit
61:33 - but basically the idea is
61:34 - uh in a lot of machine learning stuff
61:36 - you have to like read all the data
61:38 - sequentially you have to order it and
61:39 - you have to go through it step by step
61:41 - and learn as you go and like in order in
61:43 - in one like one pass through everything
61:46 - um but a transformer what it allows you
61:48 - to do
61:48 - is it allows you to actually um you
61:51 - don't need to go through it in order you
61:52 - can go through the data in any order you
61:54 - want you can go through it backwards you
61:55 - can start in the middle
61:56 - and go out from the sides you can start
61:57 - in 20 000 different points
61:59 - and then then go in random directions
62:01 - you just read and parse all the data
62:02 - together like it's
62:03 - like uh like a drop in a in a pool you
62:07 - start somewhere and you can just spread
62:08 - out you don't have to like go through
62:09 - like line by line
62:10 - gotcha um so they developed this i don't
62:12 - know how it works under the hood
62:14 - um completely but basically the the
62:17 - reason this is relevant is this allows
62:19 - you to actually run this on super
62:20 - computers and stuff on clusters because
62:21 - you can run things in parallel you can
62:23 - actually
62:23 - read the whole internet at like a
62:25 - hundred or like a million different
62:27 - positions you can start from like a
62:28 - million different spots and start
62:29 - processing it in all those places
62:30 - instead of just one at a time
62:32 - which basically means now we can
62:34 - feasibly read the internet the entire
62:35 - internet in a reasonable amount of time
62:37 - instead of it taking
62:38 - bajillions of years which is so this was
62:41 - the breakthrough
62:42 - that allowed us to do this so i actually
62:43 - think gbt2 was actually based on this as
62:47 - they're able to do that and then since
62:49 - then they were running this for like a
62:51 - couple years or something and then they
62:52 - eventually got gt3
62:54 - after it was running for a long last
62:55 - time got it by the way i just want to
62:57 - say one more one more thanks guys
62:58 - we got two more donations from let's see
63:03 - 400 half something huff for i don't know
63:06 - what that is
63:07 - i'm so horrible with these with these uh
63:10 - huff
63:10 - huffington post i don't know come on
63:13 - thank you yeah and armand of her 100
63:16 - rupees he i actually asked a question
63:17 - guys which is a good question
63:18 - is gpt 3 has if gp23 has trained itself
63:22 - so much then can it copy itself
63:23 - to some other hidden place on the
63:25 - internet and become self-sustaining
63:27 - oh no why not no
63:31 - what no it can't can you explain why
63:34 - no so this this this gpt-3 is very very
63:39 - uh robust in the sense that it can
63:41 - handle any trained
63:43 - um i mean any text problem it says like
63:45 - you can put in any text and it can reply
63:47 - with text
63:47 - okay um in any way it's very very good
63:49 - at predicting like i said
63:51 - um if it sees the word fire it's gonna
63:53 - think the word truck or alarm
63:55 - follows it much more than fire um
63:58 - cow fire cow like those aren't things
64:00 - unless they are
64:02 - but so that's really all it is it just
64:05 - understands what's the most likely thing
64:06 - to follow the next word
64:08 - based on the context you gave it so like
64:09 - for the blog post example
64:11 - um the only reason i was able to write
64:13 - that blog post is because it gave it the
64:14 - title
64:15 - so i took the titles and it said okay
64:17 - feeling unproductive maybe you should
64:18 - stop overthinking so i took all of this
64:20 - and i was like
64:21 - okay it seems like overthinking
64:23 - unproductive um
64:24 - stop uh like all these things and from
64:27 - this it was able to generate this
64:29 - but without this title it would not be
64:30 - able to generate this which means
64:32 - it can't really reason it's just really
64:33 - really clever in taking something
64:36 - and then interpolating that and
64:37 - generalizing that to spit out more
64:39 - content so you have an endless stream
64:40 - you give it a little bit
64:41 - and then it can give you infinite other
64:43 - stuff mm-hmm
64:45 - so forever i'll go forever and give you
64:46 - everything it'll just keep giving you
64:48 - more and more and more like if you give
64:50 - it
64:50 - if you if you're like hey tell me a
64:51 - story about jane the dog and jimmy the
64:54 - cow
64:54 - it can be like okay jamie and jenny this
64:56 - dog and then they'll just start telling
64:58 - a story a random story like they lived
64:59 - on a hill together
65:00 - they did this they did that so it's all
65:03 - what you understand is it's all based on
65:05 - the previous kind of text
65:07 - yeah so the way it actually works is um
65:10 - the way
65:10 - the way it actually trains trains itself
65:12 - is it would take like something like go
65:14 - take an actual blog post written by a
65:15 - human it would take this
65:17 - it would try to learn from it and
65:18 - predict the second paragraph
65:20 - okay the second paragraph and write this
65:21 - out um what it thinks is the best match
65:23 - then it would take
65:24 - both of them and spit it into itself and
65:26 - then write the third
65:27 - paragraph and then take all three and
65:30 - spit it back into itself and then write
65:31 - the fourth paragraph so it kind of like
65:32 - learns from itself as well
65:34 - and that's why it takes so long to train
65:35 - because you're not just training it on
65:36 - the whole internet you're training it on
65:38 - the internet plus everything it
65:39 - generates from the internet
65:40 - and then it's like constantly growing
65:42 - and that's why the compute power is just
65:44 - ridiculous it costs
65:45 - millions and millions of dollars to
65:46 - train this and then to run it that's
65:47 - insane stuff wow
65:49 - wow and yeah well it can't it's not
65:51 - smart enough to do
65:52 - it can only so it can't be what humans
65:55 - have done they can't do it can't
65:56 - innovate it can't innovate
65:58 - itself is what you're saying no it can
66:00 - only emulate how do you know that 100
66:02 - how do you 100 know that
66:04 - i only know i only 99 no but 100 that's
66:06 - 99 that's not 100 though
66:09 - i know i don't i mean i technically
66:10 - don't know i mean i'm not the like
66:11 - leading expert here bro
66:13 - but um and from from what i've heard
66:15 - it's only a predictive model
66:17 - so i can only predict what's going to
66:18 - happen next it can't actually
66:20 - proactively and actively go do some new
66:22 - stuff all by himself
66:23 - by the way i just wanted to say by the
66:25 - way i just want to say guys nonstop
66:27 - dre360 said uh give us the two dollar
66:30 - nation appreciated my friend and asked
66:32 - the questions
66:32 - at what point will ai be able to replace
66:34 - engineers
66:36 - engineers yes i mean to what extent i
66:40 - mean like ai has
66:41 - um it's replaced a lot i mean like like
66:45 - you know like trying to cure cancer
66:46 - i mean that's not even engineers but
66:48 - like doing like models like using
66:49 - computer models that kind of is like ai
66:51 - replacing engineers because we're not
66:52 - doing stuff by hand anymore we're not
66:54 - doing you're using models to
66:55 - replace stuff i mean like fully replace
66:57 - them yeah i don't know
66:59 - like maybe ask elon musk he always has
67:01 - those answers
67:02 - he probably already has a plan a five
67:04 - year plan for all this stuff
67:06 - yeah i mean like have you seen like
67:07 - robots and stuff you guys seen the stuff
67:09 - boston dynamics is doing i was reading
67:10 - about this the other day and i wrote an
67:11 - email on it
67:13 - about like the the applications of
67:14 - computer vision but like here
67:16 - um i'm trying to show it yeah i'll just
67:19 - show it real quick
67:20 - okay videos have you guys
67:23 - seen boston dynamics so here um
67:29 - this is some crazy ai stuff so
67:33 - here we go so
67:36 - here's a little doggie doggy robot fully
67:39 - autonomous
67:40 - you can also drive it but looking at the
67:42 - door and it's like i can't i can't uh
67:44 - i can't i can't do this man i can't
67:46 - figure this out he calls his friend over
67:48 - all right his friend has a his friend
67:50 - has a head or an arm
67:52 - it finds a door no what
67:56 - what goes down opens the door what
68:01 - uses its left foot no way open
68:04 - uses the arm and then the whole
68:07 - and then the whole swat team goes in no
68:09 - get out of here man
68:11 - and it keeps it open all you got to do
68:13 - is mount a gun
68:15 - on that thing and we're screwed this is
68:17 - from 2018 bro
68:19 - yo like like seriously and then look
68:21 - look at this here look at this
68:23 - um they also have a humanoid robot this
68:25 - is like this is like a boston dynamics
68:27 - they work for
68:29 - mit guys there you seen this yeah i've
68:31 - seen this yeah
68:32 - like yeah the running like i mean is he
68:35 - gonna do anything
68:36 - let me just run it no no but then we
68:38 - have a but then we see where he was like
68:40 - uh where they were the parkour one you
68:43 - see that one
68:44 - yeah this one look he jumps over the
68:45 - lawn look at that holy [ __ ]
68:47 - guys that's insane guys it's a robot bro
68:53 - like what is happening look one leg
68:56 - second leg balance third leg
69:00 - the arms are moving so fluidly like
69:01 - we're super close to like an iron man
69:03 - suit dude
69:04 - aaron can't even do that guys you can't
69:07 - even do that not yeah okay
69:09 - yo and then uh there's there's one more
69:11 - i think um
69:15 - oh here more parkour atlas yeah i see i
69:17 - think yeah
69:19 - this one look so this robot learns how
69:21 - to hand stand
69:22 - what what it does the summerslam does
69:25 - the somersault
69:27 - what it turns around okay and it doesn't
69:31 - do this
69:35 - to dance you know 360. boom you want to
69:38 - see a dancing robot they did that they
69:39 - did that too bro they're one step ahead
69:40 - of you check it out
69:42 - no yeah bro uptown look bruno mars robot
69:45 - okay let's see let's see if we can let's
69:47 - see i'm going to judge his dancing
69:49 - skills
69:50 - let's see let's see but
69:53 - yeah you can't hear the music can you
69:57 - i guess like don't stop wait no i can't
70:00 - hear the music
70:14 - okay that's pretty good
70:28 - give it give a thumbs up for
70:32 - for aaron singing out here look at his
70:35 - ass bro
70:38 - we are not answering this dude's
70:39 - question at all we're just looking at
70:42 - roblox
70:51 - huh bruno mars went to my high school
70:54 - man
70:54 - why are you trying to sell yourself like
70:56 - man with the jackie chan and then all of
70:58 - a sudden
71:01 - oh man trying to be so cool you know he
71:04 - move monks off
71:06 - out of frame somebody asked a question
71:08 - aviva can't ask the question
71:10 - i cannot pull up these questions and
71:11 - actually show that unfortunately but
71:13 - sometimes a question
71:14 - can we use gtp3 for a research project
71:16 - how can we use
71:17 - gpt3 for a research project via vivek
71:19 - asked
71:20 - um i mean you're gonna have to apply to
71:21 - the waitlist so look here go to the
71:23 - openai
71:24 - api website and then you're going to
71:25 - have to want to request access click
71:27 - this link and open it to the wait list
71:29 - um so of course because they're running
71:31 - this and there's a lot of number
71:32 - crunching
71:32 - they have limited resources and they
71:34 - only want good people they don't want
71:35 - like malicious people or hackers getting
71:37 - into it
71:37 - so you have to share the api you have to
71:39 - share the whole super computer um so you
71:41 - have to get on the waitlist get approved
71:42 - and then at that point maybe you can do
71:43 - research but until then
71:45 - it's probably going to be many months
71:46 - before it's public or maybe even years
71:48 - nobody knows
71:49 - got it yeah you can research i mean
71:52 - there already is research going on
71:53 - probably in
71:54 - nlp in general like if you want to look
71:56 - into it look at look up nlp
71:58 - um on wikipedia you can look at
72:01 - how it's applications have you ever
72:03 - actually ever done an nlp project before
72:05 - like in natural language processing
72:08 - little bit not not nothing extensive
72:10 - like very very little bit
72:11 - okay um interesting yeah like i was more
72:14 - like
72:15 - visual like computer learning um
72:17 - computer vision stuff but not like
72:18 - managed process got it so um yep so
72:22 - they're based on transformers like i
72:23 - said before
72:24 - uh you can look into that too about how
72:25 - now we're able to actually train things
72:27 - in parallel instead of sequentially
72:29 - uh which means you can just you can you
72:30 - can break it up into a bunch of little
72:32 - parts
72:32 - and do all the different parts at the
72:34 - same time on a bunch of different
72:35 - computers instead of doing having two by
72:37 - one
72:37 - because the way it learns it doesn't
72:40 - matter what order you do it so they
72:41 - learn how to make learn
72:42 - teach things in any order yeah yeah all
72:45 - right guys we're almost almost at
72:46 - 700 likes guys come on let's get this up
72:49 - let's get this going let's get this
72:50 - going to 700 likes
72:51 - come on you know you know you can i know
72:53 - you can
72:55 - all right and okay lastly uh the
72:58 - ramifications
72:59 - so we we've already been talking about
73:00 - this a lot going um in this whole stream
73:03 - about like
73:04 - like the applications of this you know
73:05 - like coming up with a boilerplate code
73:07 - for developers to actually like do the
73:09 - bulk like do the first half
73:10 - of the project for you in like 10
73:12 - seconds and then you just go in and
73:14 - add in all your your flares at the end
73:15 - or fix any bugs that it might have
73:16 - misunderstood
73:18 - um that's definitely a thing but what i
73:20 - want to talk about
73:21 - is uh if gp2 and these things uh were
73:24 - like so small and then we just
73:26 - jumped up to gpt3 here within a couple
73:28 - years um
73:29 - somebody i i don't understand this
73:31 - either fully but some other people
73:33 - were doing some particular models and
73:34 - even though i read the whole internet
73:36 - um it only trained it to a certain
73:38 - extent like it might only train
73:39 - everything like a little bit
73:40 - you can actually go deep and like find
73:42 - even deeper deeper rooted patterns if
73:44 - you like process the data longer
73:46 - so the idea is that these models are
73:49 - going to have more and more and keep
73:50 - growing so we're currently at 175
73:52 - billion
73:53 - okay the human brain has 100 trillion
73:57 - wow 100 trillion
74:00 - connections parameters yeah 100 trillion
74:02 - parameters so this is 175 billion
74:04 - but in theory if we can get a predictive
74:07 - model like this all the way up to this
74:08 - similar to a human brain level so like
74:10 - 175 billion we would need what
74:13 - 1 000 times so we would need 1 000 gbt3s
74:16 - to make one human brain
74:18 - no that number would be simple that
74:20 - shows how good we are
74:23 - yeah yeah but at the same time at the
74:25 - same time if you can make
74:27 - one gtp3 we can make multiple gtp3s
74:30 - right so this kind of stuff can really
74:31 - be duplicated and replicated really
74:33 - easily
74:33 - the thing is it's like it's like you
74:35 - would have 10 dumb people rather than
74:36 - one smart person
74:38 - so it's not the same like you have
74:39 - multiple gpt3s but they're just like
74:41 - they're all equally
74:42 - not smart so the idea is to train it so
74:44 - deeply that it has even more instead of
74:46 - having like
74:47 - 10 um 175 billion parameter ones then
74:50 - you would have
74:51 - 100 trillion parameter predictive model
74:54 - and then at that point
74:55 - that might literally be jarvis you know
74:57 - like an iron man you know like when
74:58 - you're speaking to jarvis and they can
75:00 - understand everything that um tony stark
75:02 - says you know iron man said like it can
75:04 - speak and it can it can like understand
75:06 - and get data for him it's like hey
75:08 - um oh yeah that's another thing it can
75:10 - do it can search for you so you can you
75:11 - can ask it any question and then
75:12 - it'll answer it for you by searching all
75:14 - of its its web stuff it's basically like
75:16 - a really jacked google search bar
75:18 - you can um wow yeah there's another uh
75:21 - thing there but
75:22 - at that point then then this thing is
75:24 - going to get really crazy it could even
75:25 - start coding like it could actually
75:26 - maybe even fully code apps like sunny
75:29 - is doing you know like the netflix clone
75:30 - stuff you could actually
75:32 - maybe even do that nobody knows but
75:33 - nobody nobody's going to want to learn
75:35 - from gtp3 though
75:36 - nobody's going to want to learn from gp3
75:38 - everybody wants to look for a person
75:39 - like sunny
75:40 - right yeah yeah you're going to want to
75:42 - learn from actual person so you know
75:43 - nice nice beard everything yeah yeah
75:48 - um but yeah that's that's it really i
75:51 - mean like going forward like gpt4 when
75:53 - it comes out like we don't know how big
75:54 - it's going to be maybe it'll be
75:55 - um 1 trillion you know then we'll have a
75:58 - 5 trillion one then
76:00 - 10 trillion then finally 100 trillion
76:02 - and we can see how how smart it actually
76:04 - is
76:04 - yeah um but yeah it's just going to be a
76:07 - matter of
76:08 - walter walter a bunch of smart people
76:10 - getting together you know elon musk
76:11 - inspiring a bunch of coders like you
76:13 - guys watching us and
76:14 - you know him hiring people at open ai
76:17 - and um
76:18 - doing cool stuff there yeah but so
76:21 - the future yeah is cool because i mean
76:22 - this is already pretty dang good so far
76:24 - it can understand like watermelon
76:25 - buttons and stuff
76:27 - but watermelon buttons that's what you
76:29 - took away from the the watermelon buns
76:33 - by the way walter asks that's the best
76:35 - one watermelon
76:36 - watermelon walter asks how can you learn
76:38 - gtp3 is there any side for this
76:40 - documentation uh just just go to the
76:43 - open
76:44 - open ai website and then they have a
76:46 - little information there
76:47 - of course you don't have access to the
76:49 - code we only we only know how it works
76:50 - like on the surface we don't understand
76:52 - exactly how it's all implemented and
76:53 - built that's
76:54 - kind of proprietary to them um
76:57 - and i don't know if it's patented or i
76:58 - don't even know what they did but
77:00 - it is available there like if you want
77:02 - to look into the research in the actual
77:03 - math of it all and like how transformers
77:04 - actually work
77:05 - then by all means go go look at it um
77:10 - and yeah and there's a good video i was
77:13 - watching
77:14 - um where these guys go into even more
77:15 - detail uh this is from a
77:17 - a channel called computer file okay
77:20 - they talk about a lot of computer stuff
77:21 - and then they talk about gbt3 and they
77:23 - go into even more detail on the
77:24 - algorithm and stuff so if you want to
77:25 - get even more
77:26 - information then you can go to them um i
77:28 - didn't feel like regurgitating
77:29 - everything they said on this stream
77:31 - um they do a pretty good job i mean it's
77:33 - pretty long 25 minutes
77:34 - shorter than the stream but go check it
77:37 - out so some cool stuff
77:39 - if you want to look into that and yeah
77:41 - i'll link all these videos in the
77:43 - in the description yeah there's a bunch
77:45 - and then here's another
77:46 - yeah this this video here there's a
77:47 - bunch of cool projects people made using
77:49 - gbt3
77:50 - there's a lot of application just
77:51 - because it's so generalized
77:54 - um oh i'm looking at the stream on the
77:56 - stream
77:59 - our stream on the stream that's funny
78:04 - yeah uh but yeah i mean other than that
78:06 - the last thing is just the limitations
78:08 - like i said
78:09 - we already we already talked about this
78:10 - a lot it is
78:12 - purely a predictive model which means it
78:14 - can only predict what's going to come
78:15 - after it so when it's writing code
78:17 - it it reads what it re reads what you
78:20 - what you took
78:20 - and then from that it can kind of
78:22 - predict what's going to happen like you
78:23 - ask it a question
78:24 - it kind of predicts what the answer
78:25 - would be and then they can grab the
78:26 - answer for you
78:28 - so it reads your your code and it's like
78:30 - okay well
78:31 - this code is probably going to correlate
78:32 - to this text and then it just writes the
78:34 - code
78:35 - so it doesn't see the big pictures it
78:37 - doesn't it doesn't have common sense
78:39 - it can't reason it can't it can't it
78:41 - can't be like
78:42 - it can it doesn't understand emotion or
78:44 - anything of course this is this isn't
78:45 - actually
78:46 - an ai this is a highly highly robust
78:49 - predictive text model um based on that
78:51 - natural language
78:53 - so it knows how to parse natural
78:54 - language it understands the patterns
78:55 - within natural language
78:57 - and therefore can communicate with
78:58 - humans through natural language but it
79:00 - can't actually think it can't actually
79:01 - innovate it can't actually take over the
79:03 - world
79:03 - it's not going to do any of that we're
79:05 - very very far from that but this is a
79:06 - good step in the right direction
79:08 - okay so it will not it's not the end of
79:11 - the world
79:12 - uh by the way i just wanted to say super
79:14 - chat thanks so
79:15 - much uh amman a hundred rupees
79:19 - um that's the question actually that's
79:21 - the question
79:22 - if gpt3 learned to give itself the
79:25 - initial parameters
79:26 - what would it what would be what would
79:29 - be the consequences what are your
79:31 - thoughts on this
79:32 - if gpt-3 learned to give itself the
79:35 - initial
79:36 - parameters uh initially what do you mean
79:39 - by initial parameters actually
79:40 - what does that mean yeah you mean like
79:43 - the title of the blog post or something
79:44 - if that's like
79:45 - so i guess maybe like that probably
79:48 - that's already what it is doing
79:49 - you know um and also the chat you know
79:52 - when we're at the chat
79:53 - yeah literally what it was doing is it's
79:55 - just feeding the messages back and forth
79:56 - to each other so it's
79:57 - it's writing this giving it to itself
79:59 - and it's responding with this giving it
80:01 - to itself responding with this
80:02 - giving it to itself got it well actually
80:04 - what it's doing is it's taking this
80:06 - and then it's falling with this then
80:08 - it's feeding both knees to itself
80:10 - like it's this then feeding life itself
80:12 - to get this fourth one then feeding all
80:13 - four to itself to this one
80:14 - that's how it keeps that's how it
80:16 - understands the context and keeps the
80:17 - context relevant as the conversation
80:19 - goes on
80:20 - but it's kind of like a game of
80:21 - telephone if you go on super long it
80:22 - does start losing coherent
80:24 - um coherence and stuff so i actually
80:26 - found this forbes article this is the
80:27 - last thing i want to mention
80:28 - um gpt-3 is amazing but it's also
80:31 - overhyped according to forbes
80:32 - okay and the reason for this here's elon
80:34 - musk and sam
80:36 - um what's his name sam alton i think his
80:39 - name
80:40 - oh it's the guy from uh what's it called
80:41 - other guy huh
80:44 - the startup guy started
80:48 - and then him and elon musk founded open
80:50 - ai so he's the ceo currently elon musk
80:52 - is just like a co-founder he's focusing
80:54 - more on tesla spacex but he does have a
80:55 - part in it
80:56 - gotcha um but yeah basically so here the
80:58 - internet is buzzing about gpt3 openai's
81:00 - newest ai language model
81:02 - um gp2 is the most powerful language
81:04 - model ever built which is what we've
81:06 - been talking
81:06 - to and it's it's due to its size of
81:08 - course 175 billion parameters we talked
81:10 - about all this
81:12 - um oh so gpt-2 was released just last
81:16 - year in 2019.
81:17 - oh no way so that was 53.5 yeah so we
81:21 - went from
81:21 - we weren't from this little itty bitty
81:24 - thing
81:25 - to this one from google to this one from
81:27 - microsoft to this huge one
81:28 - in less than a year so so five years
81:31 - from now we don't know where the hell
81:32 - we're going to be
81:34 - yeah that's going to be insane
81:38 - but uh going back to amman's questions
81:40 - he says what would be the consequences
81:42 - what are your thoughts on this um
81:46 - i think it's still limited so that ties
81:48 - into what we're talking about here on
81:49 - the swords article
81:50 - uh it can give itself stuff but whatever
81:52 - it gives itself parameters it's just
81:54 - going to keep learning within the own
81:56 - confines of what
81:57 - data it has available to it it can
81:58 - actually interpolate new data
82:00 - so like if we give it every scientific
82:01 - paper which we already have that exists
82:03 - on the internet
82:04 - it can't come up with new scientific
82:06 - like revolutions and discoveries that's
82:08 - not possible
82:09 - uh because it's it's limited to what it
82:12 - have what what it can do is you can find
82:13 - connections and
82:14 - spit out some of the data within there
82:16 - but it can't actually give you new stuff
82:17 - it can just kind of like mix and match
82:18 - it in interesting ways
82:20 - yeah that's all it really is yeah yeah
82:22 - there's some insane stuff
82:24 - by the way guys i just want to say uh we
82:26 - completed 700 likes
82:28 - holy moly guys thanks so much
82:31 - for that but yeah it says uh this is
82:34 - some epic stuff man
82:36 - um honestly gpt-3 yeah
82:39 - like wow
82:43 - yeah but i mean that's really it um
82:46 - anybody in the comments have questions
82:47 - about stuff or just want to
82:49 - have any input i'm looking why is elin
82:51 - on the thumbnail oh because i mean
82:53 - i don't know because he's the creator it
82:55 - seemed more yeah like he found it open
82:57 - ai
82:57 - and then it's from open ai yeah so
83:00 - figured it'd be more
83:01 - maxim asked the question will gpt-3 kill
83:04 - coding um
83:07 - no it won't kill that was just a joke
83:09 - but it's going to
83:10 - enhance it once it's publicly available
83:12 - i feel like um you know things like
83:14 - webflow
83:14 - or mainstreaming and like streamlining
83:16 - the way you can create code much faster
83:18 - than yeah from scratch yeah
83:20 - i feel like gpt3 is going to have a very
83:22 - similar kind of effect
83:23 - um downline or gpt4 or gp35 when they
83:26 - come out
83:27 - then i think they are going to have like
83:28 - really really powerful use cases
83:30 - in coding because it can like unit
83:33 - testing like non said or
83:35 - just spitting out code much faster like
83:36 - if a client wants a website built like
83:38 - yeah instead of using stuff you can like
83:40 - build a whole custom website just by
83:42 - writing a sentence
83:43 - it spits out the code for you you go
83:44 - into the code um
83:46 - understanding how it works and then you
83:47 - adding some extra stuff and you're done
83:49 - yeah much faster than doing a doll from
83:51 - scratch so actually
83:53 - vivek said we can give ideas to gpt3 so
83:55 - they can innovate new
83:57 - new researchers interesting maybe
84:01 - yeah maybe i mean i'm not i'm not the
84:02 - world expert on this but
84:04 - but yeah i don't see why not yeah the
84:07 - way
84:08 - thank you for the canadian five dollars
84:10 - oh thanks super chat let's build an ai
84:12 - app
84:12 - using alan ai interesting it would be a
84:15 - pretty awesome project for this channel
84:16 - i got a demo project
84:17 - link i'll put it in the chat sweet yeah
84:20 - let's see let's see the demo what is
84:23 - allen ai
84:24 - let's pop this up hold on let me make
84:25 - sure i'm actually showing it here
84:31 - ln ai lan conversation voice ai platform
84:35 - yeah interesting
84:36 - okay conversational voice
84:41 - ai platform add a voice assistant to
84:43 - your application so
84:44 - is this like jarvis why you need a voice
84:46 - assistant in your app dude that'd be
84:47 - cool honestly
84:48 - jarvis you're home we should plug we
84:52 - should plug this
84:52 - in into this and then just it'd be super
84:55 - creepy like it's talking to itself
84:57 - the the ai conversation oh that like
84:59 - yeah humans are too emotional
85:01 - ai has no emotions no greed that'd be
85:04 - funny it's very happy
85:05 - i talked to the eye yeah oh goodness
85:08 - i mean alexa and syria have done it
85:10 - before you know when they talk to each
85:11 - other it's kind of funny but
85:12 - they sound kind of [ __ ] versus this
85:14 - one is actually sounds kind of scary
85:16 - yeah i do want i do want to build a
85:17 - project something with something with ai
85:19 - machine learning i think that'll be
85:20 - really interesting
85:21 - because i personally i have done it i've
85:22 - done a few projects in terms of like
85:24 - um ai stuff yeah machine learning i've
85:27 - done an llp project i've done a project
85:28 - where
85:29 - basically we're like you know how like
85:31 - you have google search for example
85:32 - so for example what i'll do is like i
85:34 - had a project where
85:36 - um i had a project where for example you
85:39 - know i said hey
85:40 - um find me uh find me a
85:43 - a t-shirt a a
85:47 - so i would say it's a blue t-shirt for a
85:50 - max
85:50 - of a hundred dollars and they will parse
85:53 - that part out
85:54 - and it will actually search it up and
85:55 - actually i'll give you the results
85:57 - like a t-shirt a blue t-shirt that that
85:59 - has a max price of for example some some
86:01 - amount of money basically and that's it
86:05 - you know so i mean there's definitely
86:08 - something we can do
86:09 - guys if you guys have any suggestions
86:10 - for us in terms of like what projects we
86:12 - should do in terms of ai
86:13 - let us know i'm sure ammo would love to
86:15 - do it
86:16 - right aaron all right
86:20 - right aaron got it your audio cut out so
86:23 - i didn't hear anything you said for a
86:25 - while
86:25 - okay i assume you're talking to the
86:27 - audience yeah i'm still talking the
86:28 - audience it's your it's your it's your
86:30 - sky that's a little bit
86:31 - iffy it's your scribe it's a little bit
86:33 - iffy oh
86:35 - yeah i got it but i'm still talking to
86:36 - the audience guys i still see you guys
86:38 - you guys can still see me
86:39 - as you guys can partially see aaron
86:43 - yeah but yeah i think yeah if you guys
86:45 - any questions before we move on before
86:47 - we leave
86:48 - uh if you guys have any questions on
86:49 - this let us know in the comments and
86:51 - we'll take a look at them right now
86:52 - we literally probably will probably have
86:54 - like about you know two three minutes
86:56 - before we leave
86:57 - and uh but yeah one last thing one less
87:00 - thing to kind of to kind of bring you
87:01 - back guys
87:02 - like i said we have a free training on a
87:04 - free training on
87:05 - you know uh free training check this out
87:06 - actually i'll show it to you guys
87:08 - a free training right here hold on free
87:11 - training right here
87:13 - you guys should be able to see that hold
87:14 - on give me a second right there check
87:16 - this out
87:18 - boom boom free training top 10 mistakes
87:22 - to avoid doing becoming a just developer
87:24 - link is in the description below so
87:27 - check it out completely for free
87:28 - you know nothing for you if you don't
87:30 - have you don't have to pay anything at
87:31 - all
87:32 - it's just some great value content from
87:33 - qazi uh but yeah check it out and that's
87:35 - pretty much it
87:37 - yeah guys so thanks for hanging out
87:39 - talking about gp3 yeah cutting edge ai
87:42 - and um when gpt4 comes out
87:46 - uh we'll probably do another stream or
87:48 - maybe we'll have access to
87:50 - access to gpt3 when gtp4 comes out yeah
87:53 - tongue twister
87:54 - maybe jpt3 that'd be good that'd be good
87:56 - if we can get access to that that'd be
87:57 - some cool stuff we can build
88:00 - yeah we could we could be like how fast
88:02 - can we um
88:03 - how fast can we code up sunday's clone
88:07 - how fast can we put up we could probably
88:09 - code up all the clones sunny just done
88:11 - just done in a matter of like minutes
88:13 - minutes yeah
88:14 - probably sunny watch out bro sunny watch
88:17 - out you gotta watch out on this stuff
88:20 - coming for you oh but that's awesome
88:22 - that's crazy stuff crazy stuff guys so
88:24 - yeah
88:25 - and also make sure to take us in your
88:27 - instagram go ahead you know
88:28 - you know share share your share your
88:32 - your kind of journey through
88:32 - cleverprogrammer here tag us on your
88:34 - instagram and we always like to share
88:36 - your instagram on our stories um
88:39 - but i think it's pretty much it should
88:41 - we finish should we finish it off here
88:44 - um yeah let me see if i can find one
88:46 - more code um generation example just to
88:48 - like
88:48 - finish strong actually there's one good
88:50 - question here somebody asked uh
88:51 - you might be able to answer this
88:53 - question uh muhammad ikram
88:55 - asked how to start with ai and ml for
88:57 - beginners
88:59 - for beginners yes um
89:03 - learn python first learn python from
89:07 - there
89:08 - uh just dive in just find some tutorials
89:11 - on youtube and just do some stuff do
89:12 - some tensorflow do some open cv
89:14 - uh i have open cv tutorials in here
89:16 - about face detection stuff i explain the
89:18 - algorithm and everything
89:19 - if you want to learn about like a little
89:20 - bit how like it actually works behind
89:22 - the scenes
89:23 - um and then once so i'd actually start
89:25 - with that start with the faces section
89:27 - or the car and pedestrian tracking um
89:29 - and also small detection like
89:30 - on those three you can watch all three
89:32 - get started there understand the kind of
89:33 - context
89:34 - about how things actually work then from
89:36 - there then actually go do like a
89:37 - tensorflow
89:38 - project because then you can actually
89:39 - train your own models using your own
89:41 - neural nets you can design your own
89:42 - neural nets and
89:44 - put it all together so got it uh yeah so
89:46 - start with python then go to those
89:48 - those beginner-friendly ai projects that
89:50 - we have on our channel in python
89:52 - and then from there then you'll you'll
89:54 - honestly probably find like your own
89:55 - little
89:56 - path to go on at that point you'll
89:57 - something will intrigue you and you'll
89:59 - you'll probably google something some
90:00 - tensorflow project
90:01 - and i'll go look at it siraj of all his
90:03 - channel is is is pretty good for that
90:05 - kind of stuff you have a lot of topics
90:06 - got it um but i mean a lot of other
90:08 - channels have good stuff too so there's
90:09 - actually one
90:10 - exactly one recognition i want to make
90:12 - actually so yeah start with python
90:14 - but um i actually started so i knew
90:16 - python but
90:18 - uh this site helped me out a lot when
90:20 - actually creating image my first machine
90:22 - learning project
90:22 - and there was this right here and this
90:24 - was my friends was completely for free
90:25 - it's a udacity udacity course okay
90:28 - udacity course uh called intro to
90:30 - machine learning it's a free course
90:32 - right right here it's a freak
90:34 - you might say that again hello
90:37 - the audience here though it sounded it
90:39 - sounded echoey i don't know if they
90:40 - heard you
90:41 - no i think they heard me they heard me
90:42 - well so it's a free course
90:44 - introduction to machine learning um
90:46 - machine learning course really cool guys
90:48 - i learned a lot of stuff from here and
90:50 - actually i was able to apply a lot from
90:52 - here to
90:53 - my to my work and then actually from
90:56 - that work i was actually able to because
90:58 - of what i learned here
90:59 - i was able to um get a um
91:02 - transfer over to a a team
91:06 - in my work that would that deal dealt
91:07 - with ai machine learning so this was a
91:09 - real so this was some really cool stuff
91:11 - i definitely highly recommend you take
91:12 - take a look at this i'll actually drop
91:14 - that in the comments
91:14 - if you guys want to check this out yeah
91:17 - udacity is good
91:18 - udacity is really good yeah right here
91:20 - yeah this is the link guys so check this
91:22 - out guys okay
91:23 - um so yeah this is some really cool
91:27 - stuff guys honestly i think i think this
91:28 - can be the all the questions kind of we
91:29 - have
91:30 - for for today um
91:33 - that's it right yeah any kind of last
91:36 - words
91:37 - yeah i think that's it for now um
91:42 - yeah yeah no i'm just i'm looking at the
91:44 - the twitter or the dude
91:45 - the the the ceo from the the code
91:48 - builder thing
91:48 - there is one question i want i want to
91:50 - answer i think birds we like asked the
91:51 - question
91:52 - i have great love for web development
91:53 - but my teachers are pressuring me to
91:55 - learn
91:55 - mlai so what would i what should i do
92:00 - what do i say one more time so i have a
92:02 - great love for web development but my
92:04 - teachers are pressuring me
92:05 - to learn machine learning or ai what
92:08 - should i do
92:10 - oh i mean i mean it really depends what
92:13 - you want to do
92:13 - machine learning and stuff it there is
92:17 - the jobs are harder to get but they are
92:19 - higher paying but there are less of them
92:21 - uh versus web development they're a
92:22 - little bit not
92:24 - always easier but they're a little bit
92:25 - simpler to get started with uh there's
92:27 - also more jobs and more opportunities
92:30 - and it's not as math heavy there's like
92:31 - a lot of like
92:33 - um it's more business oriented i feel
92:35 - like data science machine learning is
92:37 - more
92:37 - engineering and research oriented so it
92:39 - kind of depends like what you want to go
92:40 - into like don't
92:41 - like if somebody's pressuring you on
92:43 - anything dude just don't listen to them
92:44 - unless you like
92:45 - like deeply respect like the path that
92:47 - they took and where they are in life
92:48 - yeah uh other than that like i don't
92:51 - like it doesn't matter like
92:52 - like half my professors if they told me
92:54 - something something i'd be like i don't
92:55 - care like
92:56 - because i don't like i don't care what
92:59 - they what they have to say but other
93:00 - person
93:00 - professors that i respect if they said
93:02 - something i would actually listen to it
93:03 - so just kind of make that judgment call
93:04 - yourself
93:05 - uh don't just blindly listen to them web
93:08 - development is more for
93:09 - like business applications and stuff uh
93:11 - and then
93:13 - data science is more for i mean there's
93:15 - business too i mean like youtube
93:16 - has an algorithm netflix has an
93:18 - algorithm uh that needs to be worked on
93:20 - and stuff but
93:22 - uh just focus on web development if
93:24 - that's what you like
93:25 - i would say i would say focus on that
93:27 - yeah i think that my answer to that
93:28 - would be similar if you
93:29 - specifically like web development right
93:32 - if you're supposed to if you like about
93:33 - development
93:34 - it's it's good to broaden your knowledge
93:37 - and web development there's nothing
93:38 - wrong with that
93:39 - right you shouldn't just switch right
93:41 - away
93:42 - what i love about development in general
93:43 - is it's so broad there's so much you can
93:45 - learn there's so much you can know
93:48 - if i was in your shoes for example what
93:49 - i would do is i know i love web
93:51 - development i'm going to increase my
93:52 - knowledge about development
93:54 - i know the opportunity is there i know
93:56 - my love for it
93:57 - i love the fact that i know the fact
93:58 - that i can make some good money out of
94:00 - it
94:00 - right and i'm going to so i'm going to
94:02 - put a lot of my time into that maybe
94:04 - let's say 70
94:05 - but for example let's say there's a lot
94:06 - of interest in machine learning at the
94:08 - same time
94:09 - so maybe you can put 30 of your work now
94:11 - into machine learning
94:13 - and then kind of you know and try and
94:15 - try different things
94:16 - and and learn different things right not
94:19 - there's nothing that comes to say that
94:21 - you can't
94:21 - learn both you can still learn both it's
94:23 - just that you can go ahead and maybe
94:25 - and um you know pursue what you like
94:27 - initially which is web development
94:29 - but you know also have the machine
94:31 - learning kind of on the side
94:32 - is kind of there because who knows maybe
94:35 - machine learning will become the next
94:36 - the biggest thing
94:38 - and and at that point you will be ready
94:41 - at that point you'll be ready and you're
94:42 - like maybe well maybe at some point you
94:44 - realize that you do like machine
94:46 - learning a lot because
94:47 - you've been doing it quite a bit and you
94:48 - like what's going on with machine
94:50 - learning
94:50 - and you like what type of applications
94:52 - you can make and so at that point
94:55 - you can simply just switch or just you
94:57 - know keep doing both
94:59 - so i would say yeah that'd be my answer
95:01 - for that
95:04 - yeah what yep yep yep
95:07 - guys awesome guys i think that's all we
95:09 - have for today all i gotta say guys is
