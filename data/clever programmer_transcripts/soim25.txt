01:43 - like I'm 19 but I'm 25 so I've hit the
01:47 - quarter life crisis is there such a
01:50 - thing as Quirrell life crisis I don't
01:54 - know if that's a thing or not that's the
01:57 - thing what a life crisis yeah apparently
02:00 - Frankie says it's a thing so I believe
02:02 - him but yeah I've been I'm pretty happy
02:07 - I've been pretty happy of the past 25
02:10 - years and what I've accomplished
02:13 - the things that I'm regretful of are
02:16 - things to do would consist that require
02:18 - consistency for example working out and
02:20 - getting fit that is something that I
02:24 - regret not being consistent with
02:27 - consistency is one of them like my
02:29 - weakness as big weaknesses a moon says
02:34 - he's 23 that's awesome mister says he's
02:36 - 26 Joseph says 25 yes 25 so that's been
02:42 - one of my weaknesses you know
02:43 - consistency anything that requires that
02:45 - I wish that I was more consistent and
02:47 - then I would have actually much better
02:48 - results what the thing that I am proud
02:52 - of the thing that I am good with is you
02:57 - know for example how I grinded really
03:00 - hard on creating this YouTube channel
03:02 - and how I grinded on improving my coding
03:06 - skills and that that type of grind that
03:10 - I've done that I'm pretty proud of and
03:12 - I'm happy with but yeah so there are
03:15 - certain things that I'm I you know I'm
03:17 - like I wish I could go back in time and
03:20 - I knew them in a better perspective and
03:22 - then if I could go back I would improve
03:24 - so much faster and I would grow yeah
03:28 - just pretty much grow a lot faster you
03:29 - know in all kinds of ways like

12:01 - all right let's come back to the chat
12:04 - let's see what's happening boom boom all
12:11 - right questions questions how can we
12:15 - control our three Lance how can we
12:20 - control our workflow and freelancing
12:21 - during a vacation well mix it up a
12:25 - little bit you know go freelance and
12:27 - then go back to your you know like I
12:30 - sometimes do coding while I'm on a
12:33 - vacation
12:34 - not anymore as much but I know that I
12:37 - used to I used to do that all the time
12:44 - it's better so yeah you can code
12:48 - completely when you were in when you're
12:50 - on it I started coding at like 18 or 19
12:53 - Joseph's cool I don't like the CS degree
13:00 - in college yeah I don't really like it
13:02 - that much either a moon says why are you
13:07 - so beautiful a moon I asked myself that
13:09 - every day
13:10 - yeah nourish my birthday was on the 14th
13:13 - so that was about two days ago that's
13:16 - right my birthday past
13:25 - alfa con asks cos you have a question if
13:29 - i take your profitable program or master
13:30 - class would i be able to cite hustle and
13:32 - python programming a beginner in all
13:34 - fronts yeah I mean what is your goal
13:39 - first of all if your goal is to
13:40 - freelance if your goal is to earn an
13:42 - income then if you take profitable
13:45 - program master class and take massive
13:48 - amounts of action over the period of
13:52 - ninety two hundred and four days which
13:54 - is sixteen weeks long it's a 16 week
13:56 - long program then you will see those
13:59 - results in a much shorter period of time
14:03 - so yes it will help you even if you are
14:06 - a beginner on all fronts
14:08 - but if freelancing is not your goal
14:10 - full-time is your goal then I would
14:12 - recommend that you not take my program
14:14 - profitable programmer
14:42 - w8n see says I feel yeah I just turned
14:45 - 30 in January and finally thought I need
14:47 - to actually do something worthwhile
14:48 - instead of [ __ ] around and
14:50 - procrastinating yeah we spend a lot of
14:52 - our lives [ __ ] around and
14:53 - procrastinating so it's it turns into a
14:57 - waste of a life honestly
15:10 - yeah whoops I just kind of turned off
15:13 - the livestream there for a second
15:15 - cool yeah so it turns out turns out in
15:18 - till huge waste of life I recommend that
15:21 - you not do that I recommend that you you
15:27 - focus on actually putting in the work
15:29 - actually executing on things you know if
15:32 - you work on building the execution
15:34 - muscle you will win all right guys I
15:41 - kind of want to just come in pop in okay
15:44 - so here's the thing I am feeling
15:47 - actually a little tired I just got off a
