00:00 - and these were the things that helped me
00:01 - and some simple things I'll tell you now
00:03 - is it's just as easy to sit while you're
00:05 - eating food and watch stranger things or
00:08 - I don't know I forget what other shows
00:10 - are there sweet suits I always say house
00:12 - of court suits or office Game of Thrones
00:16 - yes thank you there we go
00:19 - it's just as easy to sit there and watch
00:21 - that as eating food and just watching
00:25 - something on Python and it you don't
00:28 - have to make it feel like it's some kind
00:30 - of thing that you have to do and if you
00:33 - don't do it it's like homework
00:35 - assignment it's like work just think of
00:36 - it like oh cool like sweet I get to
00:39 - learn this and right after I'm done
00:41 - eating food you know what I'm just gonna
00:42 - put together something for my friends
00:44 - it's gonna be hilarious it's gonna be an
00:45 - insult generator and it's gonna be
00:47 - hosted on here Okuda in Roku which lets
00:50 - you put your websites online and you
00:53 - could be like they could just go to it
00:54 - and type in and you know type in
00:56 - whatever or type in their name and it
00:58 - automatically generates an insult or
01:00 - maybe it automatically generates a
01:02 - compliment so they go to your little
01:04 - Python app that you made and they type
01:07 - in you know raffia Kazi my name is Rafa
01:09 - kasi and it says Rafa cause you are
01:11 - awesome and then and if somebody else
01:13 - types it in you know cluck CEO or
01:15 - Mustapha types it and it goes most of it
01:17 - says most of what you are great or must
01:19 - have for you rock but if you want to
01:21 - create an insult generator it could be
01:22 - like most of what you suck most of your
01:24 - horrible and it could just be hilarious
01:25 - so have fun and have these ideas that
01:29 - make you have fun with it and then
01:30 - you'll improve at the same time having
01:33 - fun and then you'll improve a lot faster
01:37 - it's like how animals learn they don't
01:40 - sit there like the tiger dad is not
01:43 - going like has a whiteboard and this is
01:46 - how you run this is how you hunt they
01:48 - just let the kids run around and have
01:50 - fun and then figure out how to do all
01:52 - that same way if you kind of learn
01:56 - football soccer or basketball instead of
01:59 - having a teacher sit there on a
02:01 - chalkboard teaching you theory for also
02:03 - long just go out and kick the damn
02:05 - soccer ball have some fun with it try to
02:07 - do some tricks and mess up try to shoot
02:10 - shoot it in the hoop and mess up its who
02:12 - cares if you're four
02:13 - is off who cares if you suck at dancing
02:16 - practice it improve and then when you
02:17 - watch the video you're like oh I'm
02:20 - connecting the dots it's fun and I could
02:23 - be building things as I go along I could
02:25 - be taking Tings things from my head and
02:27 - putting them out there into the real
02:28 - world that people could use that people
02:30 - could share and could not only be fun
02:33 - little games for my friends and family
02:34 - and for myself and inside jokes which is
02:37 - awesome but could also be something that
02:39 - could make an impact in the world could
02:41 - also be something that makes me money it
02:43 - could also be something that gets me
02:45 - that job to have always wanted and could
02:46 - also be something that becomes my way of
02:49 - being able to travel and wake up
02:52 - whenever I want to and work from
02:54 - wherever I want to I just had a talk
02:57 - with one of the students from my older
02:59 - courses Opie courses his name is nazar
03:01 - Molly and he told me that he's a cg
03:05 - generalist freelancer and the reason why
03:08 - he loves freelancing for example is that
03:11 - he doesn't have to do a - he doesn't
03:13 - have to do a commute that saves him two
03:15 - hours so one cool thing is he can wake
03:17 - up and boom be at work so he's never
03:19 - late another cool thing is that he's a
03:23 - father and he gets to spend time with
03:24 - his little daughter he gets to see his
03:28 - daughter grow up
03:29 - he doesn't have to miss those moments
03:31 - with his daughter those special moments
03:34 - and that's invaluable I don't know about
03:38 - you but I can't put a price on it and
03:40 - that's what I mean when I talk about a
03:42 - rich life it's not just money but it's
03:45 - other things involved in there and then
03:48 - he went on to make $1200 using Python in
03:53 - four hours so after he took my course he
03:56 - built this thing that he could use to
03:58 - automate these graphics all right and he
04:03 - was telling me that it took the team in
04:05 - Brazil seven days to do this and it took
04:07 - him four hours to do the same thing and
04:09 - he charged the same as that entire
04:11 - Brazilian team charged and he pocketed
04:14 - $1,200 and got it done in four hours so
04:17 - think about that somebody who works as a
04:20 - as a graphic artist or you know somebody
04:23 - who's working on creating animations and
04:25 - graphics and videos gets
04:27 - to use Python to automate it so even
04:30 - whatever you're currently doing you
04:32 - could use it and it could be practical I
04:33 - could help you boost your income even if
04:35 - you love your job it could help you get
04:37 - that promotion maybe you're not ready to
04:39 - just leave your job and jump into Python
04:41 - which I get can be scary I had I read
04:43 - this comment by this girl I forget her
04:45 - name but basically she said I have a job
04:48 - I'm a single mom I have to take care of
04:50 - my son and have to take care of myself
04:52 - so I can't just leave my job but I want
04:55 - to use Python to earn that side income
04:56 - you could be doing the same thing I get
04:59 - it some of us have a lot of
05:01 - responsibilities and we can't just jump
05:03 - the ship and burn the bridges and storm
05:05 - the boats we have to go one by one so
05:09 - why not integrate Python into your life
05:11 - to become more valuable at your job
05:13 - maybe get a raise if you can't do that
05:15 - maybe do some side projects on the
05:17 - weekends and if you put in 10 hours at
05:19 - $50 an hour in one or two days you're
05:23 - bringing in two thousand dollars extra
05:25 - that's twenty four thousand dollars
05:26 - extra per year if you add on another
05:28 - client or you increase your rate all of
05:31 - a sudden you're bringing in three or
05:32 - four thousand dollars extra per month
05:33 - and now you could start to maybe think
05:36 - about changing from your current job and
05:38 - going Python you know all the way
