09:58 - people who are close to me even in my
10:00 - life a lot of them are confused and hurt
10:02 - they're like i've been doing social
10:04 - media for three years four years
10:06 - and this one guy goes i asked him like
10:07 - how long have you been doing social
10:08 - media for his like four years i'm like
10:10 - okay
10:11 - um what platforms like youtube i said
10:13 - how many subscribers do you have
10:15 - he said 100 and i'm like one you mean
10:18 - like 100
10:19 - 000 subscribers and he goes no 100
10:22 - and i said what are you doing
10:26 - on it like you must be doing something
10:28 - wrong he's like no no like i'm working
10:30 - really hard
10:31 - i'm really and i went to watch his
10:33 - content and he had pretty decent content
10:35 - but he had 100 to 200 subscribers
10:39 - max and so what i want for you guys is i
10:41 - don't want you guys to be
10:44 - going down that path of where you're
10:46 - doing three to four years of youtube
10:48 - and you only have 100 subscribers what i
10:51 - actually want for you guys
10:52 - that within three months or six months
10:54 - or 12 months
10:55 - you guys have between 10 000 to 100 000
10:58 - subscribers are you guys with this
11:00 - raise your hands if you are beautiful
11:03 - beautiful awesome everybody that's here
11:06 - guys i want you to fully play out and be
11:08 - willing to participate because that's
11:09 - how you're gonna get the results that
11:11 - you're looking for
11:12 - so thank you for that stacey and my mom
11:16 - thank you for participating that one all
11:18 - right so
11:20 - that is the most important thing if you
11:23 - want to grow your channel you want to
11:24 - work on
11:25 - banger so here is an example of what
11:27 - that means okay i'm gonna share that
11:28 - with you guys in just a second
11:30 - if i type in clever programmer
11:34 - what i'll show you guys is this so let's
11:36 - go to the channel
11:38 - and let's go to videos and this is the
11:40 - simple secret you go
11:42 - and you sort by most popular all right
11:45 - this go to any channel sort by most
11:47 - popular
11:49 - the videos that you see all over the top
11:52 - those are the bangers if you were
11:56 - in the coding industry and you made
11:58 - videos on similar titles
11:59 - and then you try to model them exactly
12:02 - like how i have them
12:04 - but maybe just change a few things here
12:06 - and there
12:07 - those will be bangers and your youtube
12:10 - channel
12:11 - in the world of coding will blow up does
12:13 - that make sense
12:15 - it's just as simple as that you don't
12:18 - have to get fancier
12:20 - you don't have to let your little ego
12:21 - get hurt because it's not unique enough
12:24 - you will just get results just that
12:26 - simple
12:28 - this is true for all the channels
12:31 - whatever
12:31 - channel that you're trying to build or
12:33 - whatever it is that you're trying to do
12:35 - model go where things are working model
12:38 - the people that are in similar industry
12:40 - that are
12:40 - crushing it then find their titles that
12:43 - are the most popular
12:44 - and then go from there okay so now so

14:48 - your channel
14:49 - uh about the coding probably
14:52 - about coding how to make like extra

14:56 - i know a lot of people in my home
14:57 - country struggling to make money
14:59 - got it yeah okay awesome
15:03 - so do you have any ideas of what

20:47 - on making your youtube explode
20:51 - you guys saw yesterday right with alicia

21:37 - banger ideas if you come up with those
21:41 - eight
21:42 - you have now the potential to have a
21:44 - youtube channel
21:45 - that could be over a hundred thousand
21:47 - subscribers just from those eight videos
21:49 - it doesn't take many videos you guys how
21:52 - many videos
21:53 - would it take for you to blow up

22:19 - it had 33 million views that channel had
22:22 - 1.94 million subscribers

26:05 - for example um
26:07 - it could be a great idea but i want to

26:14 - know what that is
26:15 - um all a lot of this stuff nine months
26:17 - ago twenty one thousand views
26:19 - um okay let's go who could be
26:22 - filler ideas as well on my channel
26:26 - or their channel let me ask you are
26:29 - there
26:29 - channels or are there channels that you
26:32 - really like
26:33 - can you give me a youtube channel that's
26:34 - really popular that you also really like

26:52 - trini is henderson and then um aaron
26:54 - dowdy huge youtuber
26:56 - i can't think of his name yeah okay um

27:08 - know about aaron dowdy
27:11 - doubt oh yes i actually spoke to him you
27:14 - spoke to him
27:16 - yeah yeah he's cool yeah okay so he's in
27:19 - you
27:20 - so basically he's in the same space
27:21 - right of what you're trying to talk
27:23 - about
27:23 - yeah manifestations stuff like that yeah
27:26 - okay
27:26 - what about any of you okay from this
27:30 - first
27:30 - two rows are there any ideas that like
27:33 - jump out at you that you're like oh
27:34 - that's kind of cool
27:37 - uh yeah uh things you must give up
27:40 - uh a new you i'm all about mine
27:44 - so it's probably uh let me see listen to
27:47 - this for 21 days i'm all into listening
27:49 - to manifestation
27:51 - and mindset stuff so yeah three right up
27:54 - the top
27:55 - another thing by the way that i look for
27:57 - guys so i'm looking for here
27:58 - what are popular titles another thing
28:01 - that i'm looking for
28:02 - is how recent are they so for example if
28:05 - this is three years ago
28:07 - if some of them are three years ago
28:09 - that's like
28:10 - maybe that could work for your channel
28:12 - but it's also a really
28:14 - long time ago so i want to look at stuff
28:16 - that's recent so for example
28:18 - two months ago 51 000 views that's
28:21 - a really good um that's a really good
28:24 - sign
28:24 - five months ago okay also a really good
28:27 - sign
28:28 - oh my god 1.5 million views girl yeah
28:31 - she's awesome this girl right here uh
28:33 - get her name too the look the young girl
28:36 - oh i mean yeah she's with only 118 000
28:40 - subscribers if she's killing it this is
28:41 - the one you want to model
28:43 - because because another she's killing me
28:45 - so this is what i want to say for you
28:47 - guys
28:47 - because this guy has 1.3 1.03 million
28:50 - subscribers
28:52 - he yeah i want to model him but it's
28:55 - sometimes this also could be like really
28:58 - far
28:58 - reach um with this 118 thousand
29:02 - subscribers if she's putting 1.6 million
29:04 - views on the map
29:05 - that's a really good one to model
29:08 - because it's not too far off
29:09 - yeah right so now i'm gonna go to his
29:12 - channel
29:12 - her channel click videos and i'm gonna
29:14 - sort to most popular
29:17 - okay five months ago four months ago
29:20 - two months ago this [ __ ] is really good
29:24 - so for example for example is this
29:28 - something you want to talk about how to
29:29 - manifest anything you want because this
29:31 - is something i constantly keep
29:32 - see i'm seeing it pop up as very like
29:35 - recent and it's like
29:37 - hitting hard is this something you want
29:38 - to talk about
29:40 - yeah i could talk about that basically
29:43 - all of her topics i have seen her videos
29:45 - so yeah
29:46 - okay cool so i believe that for you
29:50 - if you talked about this but also try to
29:52 - make your video good i mean this video
29:54 - is like not
29:55 - even good it just seems like she's just
29:57 - talking if
29:58 - if you were to make it a little bit a
30:01 - little bit like
30:02 - good i would say as in um
30:05 - have it a little bit thought out to what
30:07 - you're getting around
30:08 - yeah make sure and make sure the
30:10 - lighting is good on you so that's
30:12 - one thing i would say that's the one
30:13 - feedback that i gave you as well
30:16 - so if you're lighting if your lighting
30:19 - is good on there and you talk about this
30:21 - i think this is
30:22 - this can be one of those videos that can
30:24 - be a banger on your channel

31:39 - out of debt
31:40 - hold on one second let me just type this
31:41 - in yeah
31:43 - the credit card ones will crush the
31:46 - important thing i want to say is now you
31:48 - gotta just make it
31:49 - [ __ ] good you gotta make it like
31:50 - youtube just paid you eight thousand
31:52 - dollars this week to make it
31:54 - okay if i paid you eight thousand
31:56 - dollars you're not gonna give me back
31:58 - [ __ ] right
32:00 - if i gave you eight thousand dollars
32:01 - would you invest in a good [ __ ]
32:03 - camera
32:04 - good mic and make sure that it's the
32:06 - best thing that you can do in that one
32:07 - week
32:08 - because i don't know about you right now
32:10 - are you making eight thousand dollars a
32:11 - week right now
32:12 - no would you want to [ __ ] make eight
32:14 - thousand dollars a week
32:15 - yes would you if i gave you eight
32:17 - thousand dollars would you work like i
32:19 - paid you eight thousand dollars
32:21 - yes that's how i want you to work on
32:22 - this video okay
32:24 - because if you make it good it can
32:26 - actually blow you the [ __ ] up just this
32:27 - one video
32:29 - okay i'm gonna do that today beautiful
32:32 - what else do you want to make uh what
32:34 - other like what give me one more title
32:37 - um how i travel the world for zero
32:39 - dollars by the way
32:40 - by the way i would go maybe if you
32:43 - [ __ ] go
32:44 - this route the five best credit cards
32:47 - for beginners
32:48 - in 2021 something like that i think you
32:51 - might be able to dominate
32:53 - okay i have that on the list as well
32:55 - okay give me your second title
32:57 - um how to fix a bad credit score bad
33:01 - capitalized
33:04 - um how to okay how to fix a bad credit
33:07 - score okay cool
33:08 - so here's the thing now um
33:12 - graham stefan can make a video with no
33:15 - title and get a million views
33:16 - i'll give you an example of this okay so
33:18 - i'll go to this channel called davey504
33:21 - it's [ __ ] nuts okay this guy kills it
33:23 - it's just like
33:25 - he just smashes it like every video of
33:27 - it just is like
33:29 - kills it i'm gonna sort by some of his
33:31 - most popular videos and i want to show
33:33 - you something
33:34 - really really ridiculous if i can find
33:36 - it
33:37 - um okay maybe i won't be able to find it
33:40 - like this let's just go
33:42 - newest all right
33:45 - take a look at this video over here so
33:47 - you guys see
33:48 - this video right you guys see the title
33:50 - right here
33:53 - all right now ignore this video this is
33:54 - the one i actually want you to look at
33:56 - look at this
33:57 - do you guys see a title for this video
33:59 - no
34:00 - 1.6 [ __ ] million views
34:05 - so my point here is some of the people
34:08 - are just so ridiculous
34:11 - that you can try to model them but that
34:14 - might actually not be a good thing to
34:15 - model so for example
34:16 - what i'm worried about here is look at
34:19 - this right
34:20 - this guy probably tried to model graham
34:22 - and five months ago and it's only at 8
34:24 - 200 views
34:26 - um and let me also see how many
34:27 - subscribers this guy has because if he
34:29 - has no oh [ __ ] okay
34:31 - so this guy had 300 subscribers and he
34:34 - got 8 000 views
34:35 - so it might actually be a good idea to
34:36 - do it
34:39 - nine months ago so there's not crazy
34:44 - numbers that are happening behind it but
34:46 - i would still consider it i i don't
34:47 - think i will consider it like a crazy
34:49 - banger
34:50 - but i think it's still hot um
34:53 - i had another one which was how i
34:54 - traveled the world for free
34:57 - that might be banger
35:01 - or just how to travel the world for free
35:04 - yeah okay 254 000 views 1.5 mm two years
35:09 - ago so that's a little too late five
35:11 - years ago
35:13 - five months ago 400 views that's not 174
35:16 - 000 it's decent um
35:19 - okay so still it seems like a decent
35:22 - idea
35:23 - i i'm not saying don't pursue it if you
35:25 - do a good job on it i think you get
35:27 - tons of love tons of views uh but
35:30 - i'm still like i think the first title
35:32 - you gave me is just truly banger i think
35:34 - this title is pretty good too
35:36 - cool cool all right all right hopefully
35:38 - that was helpful brother
35:41 - all right awesome i'll take one
35:44 - last person caitlyn you want to jump on
35:51 - yes sure hey how's it going hi how you
35:53 - doing
35:54 - good okay awesome
35:57 - excited to see you love the smile you're
35:59 - looking happy
36:01 - youtube channel banger ideas what are
36:03 - you thinking about
36:09 - [Music]
36:11 - to start out um real quick i think
36:13 - you're you have
36:14 - some other mic set up right now where
36:16 - the audio is coming from so i don't
36:17 - think it's coming from that
36:18 - maybe just click next to the mute button
36:20 - and choose your microphone
36:22 - um okay can you hear me i mean i can
36:26 - hear you
36:26 - i just didn't think it was can you hear
36:28 - me i i can hear you i can hear you the
36:30 - whole time i can hear you
36:33 - that's okay okay let me just try this
36:35 - can you can you hear me better now yeah
36:36 - yeah i can hear you perfect perfect
36:38 - okay cool so tell me what are you
36:40 - thinking about in terms of your next
36:42 - upcoming video
36:45 - um let's see uh
36:49 - how to tell if coding is for you
36:52 - yeah got it okay how to tell if coding
36:56 - is for you
36:57 - okay how to tell if coding is for you
37:01 - and by the way are you are there youtube
37:04 - channels that you
37:05 - like by the way um my favorite is david
37:10 - me and he just kills it with all the
37:12 - tutorials and stuff
37:13 - okay cool so here's what i'll say on
37:15 - this right so this title i think it's
37:18 - decent but for example if you take a
37:20 - look at this
37:21 - this guy got 3 000 views this guy got 30
37:24 - 000 views but it's two years ago plus
37:26 - joshua fluke is a pretty big youtube
37:27 - channel
37:28 - um this is five years ago so like i
37:32 - don't think that this
37:33 - same title is you know has proof this is
37:36 - 400 views
37:38 - so this title i don't see a lot of
37:42 - like i think it's a good title i don't
37:45 - think it's a banger
37:47 - well i guess it would be more like is
37:49 - coding for you you straight to the point
37:51 - i mean i still think that that one is
37:53 - going to get you similar like it's
37:55 - coding for you i think it'll be
37:57 - i don't think it'll be a banger i still
37:58 - think it'll be a good video
38:01 - so when i'm looking for the banker
38:03 - titles usually they have a lot of proof
38:05 - that they work
38:06 - like big views behind it um
38:10 - are there so you like dev ed right yeah
38:13 - okay so let's go to deved i already know
38:15 - one of his most popular videos
38:18 - is on this fiverr thing do you have you
38:20 - seen that video or have you seen have
38:22 - you come across it where he like
38:24 - i paid web designers five dollars and
38:26 - fiverr or some [ __ ]
38:27 - yeah yep so see that's his most popular
38:32 - video and
38:32 - and he stole this concept from a lot of
38:34 - other people who do the same thing
38:36 - i've actually watched a lot of those
38:38 - videos too because i was curious
38:41 - can you you can you pay can you go on
38:44 - fiverr and spend
38:45 - five bucks yeah it can
38:48 - even 15 hours you get something pretty
38:50 - basic but they'll give you like a
38:52 - wordpress site
38:53 - you can even do like five dollars versus
38:55 - like a hundred dollars or five dollars
38:57 - versus a hundred dollars like
38:59 - what what that got you
39:02 - or you can or sure so like if you like
39:04 - dev ed this is one of the videos that
39:06 - has
39:07 - that is his most popular
39:10 - and and honestly it's probably not too
39:13 - hard
39:14 - to do it's only 15 minutes long
39:17 - okay yeah it's probably a lot of uh
39:19 - pre-work before the video yeah to get
39:21 - everything
39:22 - right so like um all i want you to do if
39:25 - you're gonna actually do it is
39:26 - just look at his video and then just try
39:28 - to model it very closely
39:31 - okay so like if i go or you can also do
39:33 - like fiverr
39:35 - um there's so much stuff out there with
39:38 - fiverr like it's crazy popular you see
39:40 - how it's like a banger
39:42 - idea that just works for everybody like
39:44 - it's not like it works
39:45 - one person just works for four months
39:47 - ago 2.3 million views
39:48 - five months ago 733 000 views 3.4
39:52 - million views 11 months ago
39:54 - by the way frankie we should do this
39:56 - write write this idea down
39:58 - for our channel this is [ __ ] it's
40:00 - gonna work so
40:01 - all the really banger ideas i'm also
40:03 - gonna do them but don't worry
40:04 - everybody can do them and we'll all get
40:06 - views okay it's not a competition
40:09 - um oh this look at this i worked on
40:12 - fiverr for a whole week and made
40:14 - blank and 2.6 million views oh my god i
40:18 - paid a stranger 25
40:20 - to edit my pizza commercial i mean this
40:22 - is daniel
40:23 - schiffer so i mean that one is just
40:25 - going to bang because of him
40:26 - so that and then i want you to pick
40:29 - one person's thumbnail to model do you
40:31 - want to go the dev ed route or do you
40:33 - want to go this type of route which
40:35 - route do you want to go
40:37 - dev admin meaning for dev ed he doesn't
40:40 - compare he doesn't have two he just has
40:42 - one
40:43 - uh person right he does he's not like i
40:44 - paid five dollars to somebody and i paid
40:46 - 100 bucks to somebody else
40:47 - it's just five bucks so do you want to
40:49 - go that route or do you want to have
40:50 - like a comparison slash competition
40:52 - between two
40:54 - i like the competition the competition
40:56 - is gonna work way harder
40:57 - right dope uh what are you thinking
41:00 - about paying between what and what
41:05 - i guess it depends what i could get for
41:06 - what i don't think i want to go more
41:08 - i mean the cheapest first maybe
41:10 - something like
41:11 - 50. uh let me just let me just tell you
41:14 - something
41:15 - let me tell you something okay for this
41:17 - video just
41:18 - just youtube paid this person probably
41:21 - 15 000
41:22 - just for this one video
41:28 - wow okay yeah probably over that over 15
41:32 - 000.
41:33 - so you probably won't really like i'm
41:35 - not saying go
41:36 - crazy with it but i'm saying that if you
41:38 - did go a little bit higher
41:40 - then 50 bucks or 100 bucks it won't end
41:42 - the world so you're thinking
41:43 - 5.70 or 5 or 100 what are you thinking
41:53 - it's like in case you're investing about
41:56 - that
41:56 - i mean i know there would be a big
41:58 - difference if i did like even
42:01 - what would you say if you did what oh my
42:03 - gosh
42:05 - if you like invest and then you will get
42:07 - hold on hold on one second i'm speaking
42:09 - one second so caitlyn i'm sorry i didn't
42:11 - hear you you you which one did you want
42:13 - to
42:13 - go oh my god am i back on
42:18 - i hello yes hi oh sorry it kicked me off
42:23 - oh god i missed your question okay so
42:25 - between which one do you want to go with
42:27 - like if you just pick up like you can
42:29 - just pick a random number
42:31 - oh you're not hearing anything okay
42:35 - um so it may be in the comments just
42:36 - write to her you know frankie or nas
42:39 - just like let her know
42:40 - um to just pick one but
42:44 - d was that helpful for you guys like do
42:46 - you see how
42:47 - we're going about it and that's how you
42:49 - come up with really really banger ideas
42:51 - that's how you come up with like
42:53 - which idea is going to work does that
42:54 - make sense
42:56 - yes yes you really want to go into it
42:58 - like
42:59 - if it's working for every [ __ ] person
43:02 - it's going to work for you you just have
43:04 - to then the thing that you have to make
43:07 - sure
43:07 - is um that's such a great idea like
43:11 - these ideas are all
43:12 - great so once you get the
43:15 - idea and you see there's a lot of proof
43:17 - then what you want to do is just go
43:19 - all in and make that video really really
43:21 - good that's the
43:23 - last step of the secret okay that's the
43:26 - secret sauce
43:27 - you want to make it really good like i
43:28 - might make a video i'm just thinking
43:30 - about this right now and i might just
43:31 - make one that's like
43:33 - i paid a fiver a guy 250 another one i
43:36 - paid 7 000
43:37 - and let's just see like what happens and
43:40 - i know i'm thinking about it right now
43:42 - and i know that youtube video would just
43:43 - crush so it might actually be totally
43:45 - worth doing that
43:49 - this is five dollars versus five hundred
43:51 - dollars it crushed
43:53 - so see dang right that's a lot of money
43:56 - though but i can definitely see
43:58 - that too yeah so it can still crush
44:01 - between
44:02 - you know between this and this so that's
44:04 - how i go about
44:06 - my ideas when i'm thinking about them
44:08 - this is
44:10 - my way of doing it it usually works if
44:13 - you
44:13 - this is the most proven way that i've
44:16 - come across where if you find
44:18 - proof of what works and then you model
44:21 - that very
44:22 - closely make sure your whatever title
44:25 - you have
44:25 - has a lot of views behind it so like for
44:28 - olivia
44:29 - i don't believe in the chosen one title
44:32 - idea
44:32 - i don't believe in it it i think it's
44:34 - still a good idea i don't think it's a
44:36 - banger
44:38 - should she make that video of course but
44:40 - should she also
44:41 - know that that's not the video's going
44:43 - to put on the map yes
44:45 - like that's important to know if you
44:46 - want to make it what i think about is
44:49 - like
44:49 - i have my banger videos and then from
44:51 - those videos people come and watch all
44:53 - my other content
44:55 - right you guys saw how that dude davey
44:57 - 504 dropped a video with no title right
44:59 - got 1.6 million views
45:01 - remember that video in that video how he
45:03 - made that happen is because he already
45:05 - had
45:05 - tons of banger videos he's ton of he had
45:08 - a really big audience
45:09 - so then that audience goes and watches
45:11 - that video because he has many
45:13 - subscribers
45:15 - yes he has many many subscribers okay so
45:17 - that's the important part like
45:19 - for those deeper videos i would make
45:21 - them but
45:22 - make them either a little bit later or
45:25 - make sure you're putting more effort on
45:27 - your banger videos and then your other
45:29 - videos
45:29 - you can you know you can just make them
45:31 - on a regular basis because
45:33 - i want you to get a chance of really
45:35 - blowing up as a channel
45:37 - and then those other videos will get fed
45:39 - from those banker videos
45:40 - cool like i just wanted to ask a
45:44 - question about this
45:46 - yeah uh like a if you have
45:49 - uh like uh under 1k subscribers
45:54 - yeah uh and you make a banger video
45:57 - yep so you will get views but
46:01 - you will not get monetized i think
46:04 - what does that mean like monetization
46:07 - unlocks after like
46:09 - i don't know whatever subscribers
46:12 - 4 000 hours yeah it's something like
46:14 - yeah 4 000 hours
46:16 - watched so monetization gets enabled
46:18 - when
46:19 - you have past 1000 subscribers 4 000
46:21 - hours watched yeah and then you can
46:23 - enable it but in the start you might not
46:24 - have monetization then you can enable it
46:26 - later yeah
46:28 - like i saw someone uh like his channel
46:31 - is named like it's ali jay yeah and
46:35 - his first video was the most popular one
46:38 - yeah and he got 57 million views
46:42 - wow jesus on his first video
46:46 - that's that's ridiculous so it's
46:48 - possible right like
46:49 - if you guys make a banger video it's
46:51 - very possible to just for the first
46:53 - video to get crazy views
46:54 - uh one thing i want to share with you
46:56 - guys is one like pro hack
46:58 - if you're making videos so like let me
47:00 - go to and see if i have python tutorial
47:04 - in there so if i go to this and we go to
47:08 - okay i'll just hit enter hopefully the
47:11 - video that i'm looking for
47:12 - comes up that's not it
47:16 - python tutorial
47:19 - show all
47:23 - all right so where is that 1.8 million
47:27 - one 11 ah right here yep
47:31 - so for this one for monetization
47:34 - because it's a 11 hour long video
47:38 - what you can do is you can do something
47:40 - it's like pretty advanced
47:42 - but this is something a lot of people
47:44 - don't talk about but you can
47:45 - manually go and actually place ads in
47:48 - your video
47:49 - so like usually if you let youtube put
47:51 - ads in your videos it might actually not
47:53 - put that many ads
47:54 - but manually you can go and put a whole
47:56 - bunch of ads and because it's an 11 hour
47:58 - video i knew it was it wouldn't bother
48:00 - my audience that much because
48:02 - it's 11 hours so like the gap between
48:04 - each ad is
48:06 - massive so it's not that big of a deal
48:08 - and because i sprinkled it with more
48:11 - ads then on the monetization level it
48:14 - also generates more revenue because of
48:16 - that so you guys see how this one video
48:17 - has generated 7
48:18 - 679 dollars so
48:21 - that's really like the key behind it to
48:24 - make sure that
48:25 - um the video is good and if it's longer
48:27 - you can add also manually more
48:29 - ads in there so i have a question about
48:33 - this
48:34 - yes can we do this before that
48:38 - monetization enables you cannot do that
48:42 - before the monetization enables because
48:44 - i think
48:44 - yeah once the monetization enables you
48:46 - can do it gabi go for it
48:48 - okay thanks hi i have a question about
48:52 - the banger views when do you recommend
48:55 - to upload
48:56 - a banger video because you told about
48:58 - the vanguard views will
49:01 - will send the the people to see the
49:03 - other videos
49:04 - yeah you recommend to have i don't know
49:06 - 10 videos and then a banger video
49:09 - no i i think um focus on
49:12 - bankers every week like every week you
49:15 - guys youtube
49:16 - you should focus on banger videos you
49:19 - can produce
49:20 - other content as well but i think like
49:22 - your biggest focus should be on banger
49:24 - titles that's how mr beast right now is
49:26 - at 46 million subscribers in just
49:29 - a few years because the only thing you
49:32 - focus on the big ideas another thing
49:34 - about big ideas when i say bankers
49:37 - you can either model [ __ ] that's already
49:39 - out there if you want to start to get
49:41 - creative
49:42 - you have to come up with ideas that make
49:43 - people's eyes like
49:45 - go [ __ ] like open up like crazy you
49:48 - want to look in
49:49 - people's pupils like literally when
49:51 - you're telling your idea to somebody
49:52 - face to face
49:53 - look into their eyes if their eyes don't
49:56 - go like
49:58 - their facial expression doesn't change
50:00 - that's not a [ __ ] banger idea
50:01 - if you have to explain what it is it's a
50:04 - garbage idea
50:05 - okay if so that's what i mean
50:08 - so certain things either will already
50:09 - have proof online
50:11 - but if you want to go with the cool idea
50:13 - that maybe isn't out there already and
50:15 - there's no proof
50:16 - then make sure when you say it bunch of
50:18 - people their eyes light up
50:20 - that also gives you oh that actually
50:22 - could be like a cool idea
50:24 - you know like mr mr beast does like
50:27 - crazy stuff right he'll be like
50:29 - i bought 5 000 cars for this random
50:31 - stranger
50:32 - like boom your eyes are like what the
50:34 - [ __ ] like i want to watch
50:36 - somebody buying 5 000 cars for one
50:38 - person and so then you're like
50:40 - go crazy about it so those videos might
50:43 - not be out there there might not be
50:45 - proof of it but because the idea is
50:47 - so wild and it gets people going it
50:50 - might be a good idea to drop that
50:52 - i like the one where he opened the bank
50:54 - that was giving you money
50:55 - everybody you just show up to the bank
50:56 - and they give you money for your money
50:58 - that's what i'm saying right a bank that
50:59 - gives you
51:00 - like that's crazy so that's a big idea
51:04 - so you can come up with a guy
51:07 - all right yeah that's awesome so
51:11 - go ahead ayoob okay
51:15 - uh yesterday i told you to ask you a
51:18 - question on another topic
51:21 - and i uh wait
51:25 - [Music]
51:27 - what okay do you have a question right
51:29 - now bro
51:32 - uh
51:35 - okay i'm gonna go with calvin unless you
51:37 - have a question ayub
51:39 - uh no no kazi yeah
51:42 - yesterday i told you to ask you a
51:45 - question on another
51:46 - topic and he told me to ask it later
51:50 - and i have uh what's your what's your
51:53 - question
51:54 - what's your question uh i learned
51:58 - python and jungkook from your lessons
52:00 - and tutorials
52:02 - and i can build a social media site and
52:05 - jungle
52:06 - okay can i work with you a live uh to
52:08 - build a social media
52:10 - site okay send us something
52:13 - right now we're not really taking on
52:14 - more content creators but
52:16 - if you want to send us something you can
52:18 - send it okay but thanks for your
52:19 - question ayoob i want to make sure we're
52:20 - talking about this training right now
52:22 - calvin go for it brother
52:26 - um can you hear me yeah okay so
52:29 - um i posted my video today like my first
52:31 - ever
52:32 - my channel yeah and youtube is saying
52:35 - something about
52:36 - copyright infringement or something like
52:39 - music
52:40 - music probably yeah yeah music yeah so
52:42 - why
52:43 - i understood that you would have to get
52:45 - a license
52:46 - get epidemic yeah so like get something
52:49 - like epidemic sounds or go to youtube
52:51 - and download
52:52 - free copyright free music and then use
52:54 - that in your videos
52:55 - because if your videos have copywriting
52:58 - infringement and you're using like
53:00 - popular songs uh what you're going to
53:02 - need to do then is there's no
53:03 - monetization on those videos
53:05 - okay yeah i understand that but like i
53:08 - also like i
53:08 - searched on youtube how to get a
53:10 - copyright for music for do you use music
53:13 - in your videos then appeal it
53:15 - yeah okay so that's how i can get it i
53:18 - should appeal
53:19 - like did you did you use copyrighted
53:22 - music or did you use
53:23 - non-copyrighted music i use copyrighted
53:26 - music so then you're going to get a
53:28 - copyright strike
53:29 - yeah it's like even even for like two
53:31 - seconds man it's like
53:33 - when you're a new channel and nobody
53:35 - knows you it's like right
53:37 - if you feel like you did something fair
53:39 - if you feel like you did something
53:41 - that's like it's supposed
53:42 - it's good then file and appeal okay
53:46 - okay because like i'm like what if i
53:47 - want to just use like a two second clip
53:49 - of drake's music i think if you use two
53:51 - seconds it falls under something called
53:53 - fair use
53:54 - so i think like maybe that could work so
53:57 - make sure you
53:58 - appeal it and look more into the youtube
54:00 - laws but i i think if you appeal it
54:02 - you might you'll you'll get it back uh
54:05 - although go for it brother
54:06 - i'll take on one or two more people guys
54:08 - i'll take on one more person and then
54:09 - after that guys we're going to

63:27 - so like very few of them sound like
63:29 - truly banger titles did you do your
63:31 - research
63:33 - yeah uh i before posting before creating
63:37 - my youtube channel i was
63:38 - doing some research for my own like what
63:40 - kind of titles i should be
63:42 - right there there are titles that are
63:44 - good and great then there are bangers
63:46 - are these bangers
63:48 - uh i feel some of them are bankers and
63:50 - some of them are just like not bangers
63:52 - yeah okay so
63:56 - are there channels that you follow on
63:58 - coding that you
64:00 - really enjoy what are some channels that
64:01 - you really really enjoy
64:03 - well to be honest and to be frank the
64:06 - first channel which i
64:07 - was uh i followed was was yours
64:11 - which one are you enjoying right now
64:12 - which channels do you like it's okay if
64:14 - it doesn't have to be mine that's fine
64:16 - no i'm not being really honest it was
64:19 - only you that's it
64:20 - then after that i went to uh so then go
64:23 - to some of my
64:24 - go to some of my videos and get
64:25 - inspiration from there so i have
64:28 - big time bankers how i learned to code
64:30 - in less than x amount of months
64:32 - um how uh there's top five programming
64:36 - languages to learn in 2021
64:37 - top four dying programming languages to
64:40 - you know
64:40 - uh to not learn or whatever i have
64:42 - something like that top four dying
64:44 - programming languages of 2021
64:46 - rap pascal yes so you can go negative as
64:49 - well
64:49 - if you can't come up with a positive
64:51 - idea of something you can go with the
64:52 - negative of something like
64:54 - why you should not code in 2021 if you
64:57 - make that a good video that can do
64:59 - really really well
65:00 - um so some ideas you know
65:04 - can you do a html crash course a css
65:06 - crash course can you do a s
65:08 - um can you do a basic beginner's
65:10 - javascript
65:11 - course those bang those crush
65:15 - so that's what i would say cool guys
65:19 - uh i'll do 30 more seconds does anybody
65:21 - need help with anything
65:28 - raise your hands if raise your hands if
65:29 - you're done
65:33 - okay most people are raising their hands
65:37 - raise your hands if you got a little bit
65:38 - to go raise your hands if you're not
65:41 - done yet you got a little bit to go
65:45 - oh okay dope

65:57 - right back into it
65:59 - cool you guys with me so far
66:02 - yeah i want to hear you guys are you

66:10 - have fun
66:12 - that was fun it was fun
66:18 - beautiful awesome awesome that's really
66:21 - exciting so good
66:22 - almost all of us got up to eight titles
66:25 - yes
66:26 - yeah yes okay even if we don't have full
66:30 - eight
66:30 - don't don't beat yourself up over it
66:32 - that is okay the point is that we got
66:34 - close to that goal all right so
66:38 - um we're gonna i'm gonna take a look at
66:40 - some of your guys's
66:41 - um i'm gonna look at some of your guys's
66:44 - ideas
66:45 - so for example i'm looking at hormones
66:47 - right now so he has
66:48 - making a 3d game in two hours they bet i
66:51 - can't do it
66:53 - number two designing using css no
66:56 - no javascript three i made a meme review
66:58 - app for writing an ai that rose people
67:01 - for me
67:01 - that might actually crush that might
67:03 - actually do really well
67:05 - top 10 apis for new developers hormone
67:07 - your
67:08 - ideas are great now it's time for you to
67:10 - execute if you execute it
67:12 - really well just with these eight videos
67:14 - really really well
67:16 - made these videos truly truly good
67:18 - videos you can look at for example how
67:20 - uh
67:21 - cali haldon makes his videos if you
67:23 - model good channels and you make these
67:25 - videos
67:26 - i believe that with just these eight
67:27 - videos if you sat over
67:29 - a hundred thousand eighty to a hundred
67:31 - thousand subscribers by the by next year
67:33 - i would not be surprised all right
67:36 - let's take a look at another one rocio
67:39 - says a five a five dollar logo versus a
67:43 - hundred dollar logo on fiverr
67:45 - rocio if you do a good great job with
67:47 - this video this can crush
67:50 - that's a great title great title how i
67:53 - became a software engineer
67:54 - racio that's going to crush most people
67:57 - one want to know that
67:58 - two if you're a female developer people
68:00 - want to know that even more because
68:02 - they're not a lot of female developers
68:03 - out there that have channels
68:06 - so like that gives you a very unique
68:09 - viewpoint into this world
68:10 - also you're going to inspire and help a
68:12 - lot of female software engineers or
68:14 - female developers that are trying to
68:15 - become a female developer because so
68:17 - male dominant so when you
68:19 - are a female developer and you're
68:20 - excited about you're talking about it
68:22 - you just
68:22 - become a path leader
68:26 - so i'm excited about awesome thank you
68:29 - thank you for that feedback yep you got
68:31 - it russia great
68:33 - daniel okay i'm looking at yours first
68:36 - steps into data science the hardest part
68:37 - of learning data science my biggest
68:39 - breakthroughs in data science the best
68:40 - tools to get started in data science
68:42 - tips and tricks
68:44 - daniel if you go around the route of
68:46 - data science
68:48 - and you make good content you're you're
68:50 - just going to fly
68:52 - you don't even need to be the craziest
68:53 - with the titles or ideas
68:55 - if you go to the data science route and
68:56 - you actually give valuable stuff you're
68:58 - going to blow up
68:59 - if you do the best data science
69:01 - interview tips and tricks if you do
69:03 - something on interviews
69:04 - with data science that video can be
69:06 - sitting at 800 000 views in six to 12
69:08 - months
69:09 - so the interview stuff i think go more
69:11 - into that i think that could win
69:13 - uh nikhil okay i'm looking at this
69:17 - why you should pick up html5 right now
69:19 - and how it can change your life
69:21 - not a banger because bangers have a lot
69:24 - of proof behind them so
69:25 - not truly a banker let's code in 2021 i
69:28 - think it's good
69:29 - again nikhil not a banker uh
69:32 - so almost there i would work more on
69:34 - like make sure that there's
69:36 - proof behind what you're looking for and
69:38 - if you're
69:39 - similar titles to what you're about to
69:40 - talk about have hundreds of thousands or
69:43 - millions of views
69:44 - and within the last like nine to ten
69:46 - months then you're you know on on track
69:49 - to crush it
69:51 - matt short 15 python projects in 15
69:54 - minutes
69:55 - that will do [ __ ] phenomenally well
69:59 - you just have that one has 1.2 million
70:01 - views on another guy's channel
70:03 - 1.2 million views and how long when did
70:05 - he post the video
70:06 - one year a year ago year ago yep i know
70:08 - which video you're talking about
70:10 - so if you make the video similar to his
70:12 - and you go with a similar thing you can
70:14 - win
70:16 - all right python beginner crash course
70:18 - you can win
70:20 - django crash course you can win uh
70:23 - python classes and instances
70:24 - i don't know maybe um i don't know about
70:27 - that one
70:28 - that one has a million hits yes i know i
70:31 - know
70:31 - when was this made uh that one is pretty
70:35 - old it's one of corey schaefer's it's
70:36 - like three or four years
70:37 - i know which one you're talking about so
70:39 - that's why i'm like i don't know
70:41 - uh but it could work so give it a try
70:44 - what does it take to become a python
70:45 - expert maybe
70:48 - build an amazon price tracker in python
70:50 - that's something we did
70:51 - that will work for you if you make it a
70:52 - good video um
70:55 - anything with like python course or a
70:57 - complete course those will work like
70:59 - anything with like
71:00 - oh a beginner uh
71:03 - beautiful soup tutorial 2021 like
71:07 - guide those will work beautiful soup is
71:09 - not going to get millions of views
71:10 - because
71:12 - first there's like a niche of python and
71:14 - then within that there's a niche of
71:15 - people that know actually about it most
71:17 - not every python developer is going to
71:18 - know about it so it's going to get fewer
71:20 - views just like django is going to get
71:21 - fewer views
71:22 - but you're going to have a very tight
71:24 - audience from it so that's
71:25 - that's still really good so great
71:28 - so should that one be like scraping
71:30 - instead of beautiful soup complete
71:32 - courses scraping yeah
71:34 - yeah i would go scraping yeah that will
71:35 - work better cool okay
71:38 - great great titles um let's see here
71:41 - naman good titles
71:45 - um but i don't really see a banger title
71:48 - in there so keep working on it
71:50 - uh let me see i'm going through i'm
71:53 - trying to fly through them as fast as i
71:54 - can
71:55 - alexandros you're right on the track
71:57 - python flask for absolute beginners if
71:59 - you go deep in that make that [ __ ] good
72:01 - you're [ __ ] gone that's gonna put you
72:03 - on the map data types in python that's
72:06 - cute
72:06 - how to use functions with python that's
72:08 - also cute the why i say that is because
72:10 - even
72:11 - with our channel with 830 000
72:12 - subscribers those videos got like 800
72:15 - [ __ ] views like
72:16 - 1200 views but python flash tutorial for
72:20 - beginners
72:21 - that's gonna fly okay so i would focus
72:24 - all my energy and attention into those
72:25 - like big
72:26 - courses and then just put them out there
72:28 - for free you'll win
72:30 - nora what career okay
72:34 - um i would again i would emphasize that
72:37 - you're probably not
72:40 - like look at truly the channels that are
72:43 - killing it or videos that have a lot of
72:44 - views
72:45 - and model them i would play with the
72:48 - titles here okay because
72:51 - yeah yeah i would definitely play with
72:52 - the titles here i think that requires
72:54 - some work
72:55 - frank how much does a mobile developer
72:57 - make that could be really good
72:59 - uber clone will bank uh instagram clone
73:02 - will do well
73:04 - let's see top four mobile programming
73:05 - languages i think that could do really
73:07 - well
73:08 - um and then all the dead ones i think
73:12 - will do
73:12 - good i don't think they're bangers but i
73:14 - think they'll do good
73:16 - um okay awesome
73:20 - redian that
73:23 - okay you're subscribing change the
73:26 - future
73:27 - uh top five programming language of 2021
73:30 - that's i mean that's a banger now you
73:32 - just have to do a really good job of the
73:33 - video because
73:35 - once you're in the banker title then you
73:37 - have to really make sure you have a good
73:38 - video because you're going to be
73:39 - competing up there with me
73:41 - you're going to be competing up there
73:42 - with a few other people because my team
73:43 - is going to get to work on
73:44 - top five programming languages 2021 then
73:48 - like so you got to make sure it's good
73:49 - if it's better than ours you're going to
73:51 - win
73:51 - that's going to be [ __ ] sick i'll be
73:53 - pumped for you uh if it's not better
73:55 - than ours then it's going to be behind
73:57 - hours
73:57 - so for when you get the title and
74:00 - thumbnail right then it's
74:01 - got to go all in on the video and make
74:03 - sure it's the best thing that you can
74:04 - put out
74:06 - um okay cool clara
74:09 - all right a beginner entrepreneur so the
74:12 - one that pops out to me out of all of
74:14 - them
74:14 - almost every other idea that you have
74:16 - here my eyes kind of
74:17 - glaze over them because they're not
74:20 - necessarily great youtube video titles
74:23 - uh but the one that that's before
74:27 - how i became a software engineer and an
74:30 - apprentice you could do like
74:32 - medical assistant or i'm sorry i think
74:35 - how i went from being a medical
74:37 - assistant to a software engineer i think
74:38 - that could be a great
74:40 - so like how that one seems like a banger
74:42 - idea to me i think that would be cool
74:44 - thank you yes the other ones i think
74:48 - you are those ideas are very unique and
74:50 - they sound really
74:52 - good but i want you to actually go on
74:54 - youtube and
74:55 - make sure each idea has a lot of views
74:58 - and then work on those types of titles
75:00 - and then within the content
75:02 - say your message so for example i see a
75:04 - lot of your contents are like zero to
75:06 - hero become your own hero
75:08 - um rise and shine never give up on your
75:10 - dreams struggling till i'm not
75:12 - that's not your titles it's going to get
75:14 - you zero views if those are your titles
75:16 - but if you say those things in your
75:18 - videos if they're your sign-offs if
75:21 - they're part of your intros if you're
75:22 - seeing them in the middle of the video
75:24 - people are going to listen to it and
75:25 - they're going to become a part of your
75:26 - culture but nobody's ever going to click
75:28 - on those videos where those are the
75:30 - titles

76:54 - from your youtube videos what i remember
76:56 - is invest guys please [ __ ] invest in
76:58 - a camera
76:59 - invest in this yeti might get if you're
77:02 - serious about this
77:03 - put that money down if you need to
77:04 - borrow that money buy that [ __ ] with a
77:06 - credit card finance it
77:08 - it's going to cost you 100 bucks a month
77:10 - to get a great computer
77:11 - it's going to cost you like some bucks a
77:13 - month to get a camera get all this
77:15 - equipment because
77:17 - if you do these videos well and with
77:19 - good quality these videos are going to
77:21 - pay you way more than what you're going
77:23 - to invest into the equipment so if
77:24 - you're serious about this just invest
77:26 - like don't
77:27 - spend time thinking about it and [ __ ] um
77:30 - even when i started there's also
77:31 - there's black friday sales on all the
77:33 - yeti mics too like look look out for
77:35 - those
77:35 - yeah so look out for the sales or
77:37 - whatever but like
77:39 - seriously guys because even when i
77:42 - started
77:42 - my youtube channel i went into
77:45 - debt to get a camera to get the
77:48 - equipment because i just believed that
77:49 - it would work
77:50 - and then those same videos that i put
77:52 - out have now
77:53 - generated six thousand eight thousand
77:55 - dollars just in ad revenue so they paid
77:57 - off for my imac and my camera and
77:59 - everything that i
78:00 - got so invest in it because if these are
78:04 - bangers
78:05 - make them as good as the you pop as you
78:08 - possibly can
78:12 - you okay thank you you got it awesome
78:15 - um aldo one second here i'm just going
78:19 - through all those
78:20 - okay that's looking good just make sure
78:22 - there's a lot of proof behind those
78:24 - although and
78:25 - these titles look they look good
78:28 - i think what you will have to do is make
78:30 - sure you make your videos also really
78:32 - good
78:33 - yes thank you um zach i mean if you go
78:36 - this route zach elson

78:43 - about this and they're making their
78:44 - videos good because
78:45 - machine learning for picture recognition
78:47 - how to study machine learning
78:49 - anything with data science and machine
78:50 - learning you're just gonna win by
78:51 - default
78:52 - like because there's so few people out
78:54 - there and the demand of it is just
78:57 - stupid um so you're gonna win
79:01 - just make sure you make it good
79:04 - okay guys so maybe i won't be able to go
79:07 - over everybody's
79:09 - but i hope that this was a valuable
79:10 - session for you where we worked out
79:13 - on these eight videos was it a valuable
79:14 - session for you guys
79:16 - yeah beautiful yes awesome
79:20 - awesome okay great so
79:23 - uh these are the videos that if you guys
79:26 - started
79:27 - caitlin did you put yours in the zoom
79:28 - chat yeah i put them individually i
79:32 - didn't lump them together yet
79:33 - okay okay got it um cool cool
79:37 - so yeah just make sure that if you get
79:38 - these titles right
79:40 - it's kind of like it's kind of like
79:43 - imagine you're navigating to um
79:46 - navigating to go somewhere right if you
79:50 - are navigating to
79:51 - go somewhere that you've never been
79:53 - before when is the perfect time to put
79:56 - that into the gps
79:58 - i'll give you guys a few options before
80:01 - you leave
80:02 - in the middle of driving or once you get
80:05 - at that place
80:06 - when is the best time to put in the
80:09 - directions into your gps
80:11 - when is the best time before you're
80:13 - starting before you leave
80:15 - okay that's what the [ __ ] you have to do
80:17 - when it comes to youtube
80:20 - you ha when it comes like you cannot be
80:22 - successful
80:23 - if you don't get the big ideas right you
80:26 - cannot win on youtube
80:29 - that's the most important thing it
80:31 - doesn't matter how much you drive
80:33 - if you don't know the address to the
80:34 - place that you're going and the
80:36 - directions to get there
80:38 - no matter how much you drive are you
80:40 - ever going to get to your destination no
80:46 - no no you can what if you drove for 2
80:50 - 000 hours
80:51 - did you get there no
80:54 - you literally won't right like what if
80:57 - the place is in [ __ ] england
80:59 - right it's like literally and if you're
81:01 - in different country you can't even
81:02 - so like so this is the really really
81:06 - important thing
81:07 - you have to map these out it doesn't
81:09 - matter how hard you work on youtube if
81:11 - your titles
81:12 - or ideas or whatever aren't on the money
81:15 - then everything else that you do you're
81:16 - just gonna scramble in million different
81:18 - places
81:19 - and it's gonna lead to zero results so i
81:21 - wanna make sure that this part that you
81:23 - guys have
81:24 - you guys have a down pat okay so
81:28 - now we should have an idea of what we're

94:46 - perfect so i have this question like i
94:48 - after watching your videos
94:49 - like i i had no plan of starting a
94:51 - youtube channel but after watching your
94:54 - videos i was motivated
94:55 - and i have this idea that i want to
94:58 - share with people like or for
94:59 - the past one year yeah i've been solving
95:01 - a lot of data structural algorithms
95:03 - questions
95:04 - on lead code platform yep okay so what i
95:07 - want is like
95:08 - uh when i uh used to uh do any questions
95:11 - i used to
95:11 - search a lot in net all on youtube yeah
95:14 - and used to go through a lot of videos
95:16 - yeah but and every time i used to like
95:18 - change
95:19 - channel because some question was good
95:21 - in one particular channel
95:22 - and some question was good at one
95:24 - particular channel okay so what i'm
95:26 - planning to do is
95:27 - like i want to give a like a full
95:29 - tutorial of all the questions
95:30 - got it and all my videos would be about
95:33 - data structure and goal items
95:34 - got it but at the same time
95:37 - i understood like it doesn't have a
95:39 - banger title
95:40 - so can you help me out with that cool
95:43 - should i go for some other content or
95:45 - something like that
95:47 - like i'm a little confused over there
95:48 - okay did you study similar titles to
95:51 - what you're looking for and did they
95:52 - have a lot of views
95:54 - oh like a lot of views means 100k like
95:57 - okay 100k max there i mean look there's
96:00 - a channel cs dojo
96:02 - he does a lot of like computer
96:04 - programming questions right so maybe
96:06 - take something on how he does it and
96:07 - what his title is and do something
96:09 - similar
96:11 - oh but just tell me one thing like oh
96:15 - like i'm solving one question okay in
96:17 - particular in one video
96:18 - so isn't that restricting my target
96:21 - audience
96:23 - like i want to share this content right
96:25 - but i'm not sure that
96:27 - this content would be valuable to many
96:29 - people or not
96:30 - i mean if it's again i would look at the
96:33 - channels where they have done it they
96:34 - got tons of views so if it's cs dojo
96:36 - who's done it
96:38 - one channel kevin norton jr just check
96:41 - out one channel can you give me some
96:42 - feedback on that
96:44 - it's not mine like i was uh studying
96:46 - that channel
96:47 - kevin norton junior okay kevin
97:01 - um what is it
97:10 - yeah okay maybe just type in what you're
97:13 - looking for bro
97:15 - maybe just type in what you're looking
97:16 - for like on zoom because i have no idea
97:19 - what you're talking about
97:20 - i'm typing it in i'm getting edward
97:22 - snowden who's the whistleblower
97:24 - american whistleblower who copied and
97:26 - leaked highly classified information
97:27 - from national security
97:29 - all right um
97:33 - okay so here we go
97:40 - um and i know that there are other okay
97:42 - so what about it
97:43 - so this guy solves a lot of problems
97:46 - from lead code uh-huh
97:49 - so like i am planning to make a channel
97:52 - like this
97:52 - okay so is it the way to go for yeah
97:56 - is it the right track like you can see
97:59 - these
97:59 - amazon coding interview questions right
98:02 - so yes one of the questions yeah
98:04 - something like this yeah that's great is
98:07 - it a good way
98:08 - yeah it's a good way i mean again look
98:10 - at where they're getting really really
98:11 - good views and they're crushing it
98:13 - um i would go there so like i mean i
98:16 - don't know to me 62 000 views one year
98:18 - ago isn't like that crazy
98:20 - 68 000 six months ago that's decent but
98:23 - again if you stay in this track i mean
98:25 - the guy's
98:26 - 50 000 subscribers if you model him
98:28 - you're gonna be on the right track
98:30 - okay okay all right awesome
98:33 - thanks for coming on um beautiful
98:37 - any okay so i want to see you guys if
98:39 - you guys have questions
98:41 - about anything now would be the time
98:43 - i'll take on
98:46 - okay hold on just raise your hands if
98:48 - you have a question
98:50 - i'm going through okay harmon
98:56 - um okay so kazi like uh yesterday i said
98:59 - i'd be
99:00 - making a video right so um today
99:03 - i went down my discord and started like
99:07 - streaming on twitch because that's the
99:08 - usual way i make content
99:10 - nice and we had like seven to eight
99:12 - people in the channel right
99:14 - yeah so it was easier to talk during
99:17 - that
99:17 - call like you weren't stressed about
99:19 - making a video
99:20 - and content was sort of already
99:22 - generated yeah like my plan is to just
99:25 - take that
99:25 - time lapse it get the good bits and post
99:28 - it sure
99:29 - that's a great idea uh so like
99:32 - if uh let's say i want to directly
99:34 - stream on youtube
99:36 - yeah instead of like twitch but i
99:39 - i'm just starting my channel so i don't
99:41 - have any subs or
99:42 - like nobody would get notified for it
99:44 - that's fine will that be okay that's
99:46 - okay
99:46 - oh it's complete if i should uh like
99:49 - keep my
99:50 - like live streams up or should i just
99:53 - like you can keep them
99:54 - down never never delete anything never
99:57 - go backwards
99:58 - that's my belief never go backwards
99:59 - never delete anything so you can stream
100:01 - to your channel and then you can cut it
100:02 - up and post it too
100:06 - i can make it private and then like edit
100:08 - it one of my favorite channels
100:10 - is this one okay chess bro i love this
100:13 - channel i [ __ ] watch it
100:14 - so much um and they
100:18 - they stream to twitch all the time and
100:20 - then they just cut up their twitch
100:22 - and then just package them on youtube so
100:24 - for example they might have like a
100:26 - fun moment or like a really great moment
100:29 - that happens
100:30 - i was like eric kids top 10 highest
100:32 - chess.com ratings of all times
100:33 - right and now it's a 23 minute clip from
100:36 - his stream
100:37 - so if i watch this scott
100:41 - nice bird houses bluehost can help turn
100:46 - the curse off you need to pay for the
100:48 - that to go away man i have
100:50 - i've paid for it so many times it's not
100:52 - even funny all right
100:54 - so um here we go i have a channel that
100:58 - i'm like
100:58 - like this is so crazy
101:02 - this guy is just playing freaking chess
101:04 - right and it's just a video
101:06 - and it crushes it this guy's getting 60
101:08 - 000 100
101:09 - 000 views on every video that they're
101:11 - repackaging from their twitch i think
101:13 - that's a great idea
101:14 - right um can you look at the video that
101:17 - i'm referring to
101:18 - for the new spot it's by danny d and i
101:24 - dropped drop a link and check it out and
101:26 - he did a
101:27 - video on twitter just type twitter
101:29 - you'll find the video easily
101:31 - it's not a small channel see
101:35 - the first one no it's gni
101:38 - simply this one right this guy right
101:40 - here right okay
101:42 - yeah what about it uh like this is the
101:45 - sort of content that i'm trying to
101:46 - produce
101:47 - i mean you're gonna win that's something
101:49 - yeah if it's 3.6 million views six
101:51 - months ago
101:52 - why is that something that provides
101:54 - value so i uploaded a short video on
101:56 - twitter asking you to give me your game
101:58 - ideas and mechanics and the five most
102:00 - popular replies would be morphed into
102:02 - one
102:02 - single track so adding in
102:06 - some fights again yeah if you keep it
102:09 - similar to this i mean you're gonna
102:10 - crush
102:11 - yeah all right yeah okay if you keep it
102:13 - similar that's my
102:15 - main reference point awesome all right
102:17 - awesome harmon thanks for jumping on
102:19 - brother
102:20 - that's a great idea i think that's a
102:22 - great channel to model after okay that's
102:24 - like
102:25 - banger when i even was looking at your
102:26 - titles i'm like whoa those are looking
102:28 - like some great titles
102:30 - now on your end your execution has to be
102:32 - really money and then you're good to go
102:35 - um i have all the setup i need i just
102:37 - have to good
102:38 - like get things done and i have a lot of
102:40 - people who can review it maybe for
102:42 - postings

102:45 - santana says uh i love chestastic that's
102:48 - hilarious
102:49 - uh that's my youtube channel that i
102:51 - started before my coding channel
102:54 - and uh that was even like
102:57 - my my um man
103:01 - that those were the days that used to be
103:02 - really nice holy [ __ ] almost 500

103:32 - mean that's pretty epic
103:33 - [Music]
103:36 - and i'm here to explain about a new
103:38 - concept in chess
103:40 - if you are new to chat that's vitally
103:42 - imp
103:43 - 20 total moves in the start well which
103:45 - one do you choose to play i mean
103:47 - that's me i'm gonna have to isn't the
103:50 - benghazi
103:59 - something changed some something
104:01 - definitely happened
104:02 - i think it's because i'm wearing
104:03 - different glasses now that's the main
104:05 - difference
104:08 - okay so uh what's
104:11 - up somebody said they have a question
104:13 - yes i do have a question
104:15 - eric go for it yeah um i have another
104:18 - idea instead of coding i have one more
104:20 - idea
104:21 - um what if i do like a random video
104:24 - chatting with people they don't know
104:26 - that i'm doing on the youtube so i will
104:28 - randomly talk with them
104:29 - yeah and i will post it in youtube
104:32 - should i
104:33 - ask them for the permission yes on
104:36 - youtube
104:36 - yes just to be safe
104:39 - like it should be only verbally like hey
104:42 - you
104:43 - you're going to be in youtube yeah yeah
104:44 - yeah i mean it's like not the craziest
104:46 - thing but like i would you know just to
104:49 - like cover your
104:50 - ass but i mean it's not again it's like
104:52 - not the craziest thing so like for
104:54 - example
104:55 - we went to we did this one video right
104:56 - where we're in a mall
104:58 - and we're interviewing people so i think
104:59 - it's like why
105:01 - you should learn programming clever
105:04 - programmers if i type that in
105:06 - this video so like this video we've all
105:09 - heard the stories
105:10 - about personal data being sold every
105:13 - time you use the internet
105:15 - our internet happens over and over and
105:18 - over again
105:19 - it's like the all right so here we go so
105:22 - how much do you guys think a programmer
105:24 - makes
105:26 - one i gotta do more of this [ __ ]
105:32 - dude is the lockdown happening or can we
105:34 - go and interview people in santa monica
105:38 - i would love to do like why you should
105:40 - start youtube
105:42 - and then we go and interview people
105:48 - yeah how much yeah that would be fun so
105:50 - in this
105:51 - video right like i go through it so i i
105:54 - actually asked the people and this last
105:55 - thing is this okay if we
105:57 - choose to put it on youtube go for it is
105:59 - this okay if we put this on youtube
106:02 - yes i'm fine can we put that on youtube
106:04 - yeah
106:05 - go yes yes amazing ruby nice to meet you
106:08 - where do i find you guys
106:11 - yeah so we asked the people in this one
106:13 - right like can is it cool with you if
106:15 - you put it on youtube they're like yeah
106:16 - is it cool with you
106:17 - is it cool with you yeah most of them
106:19 - are gonna be like yeah it's cool with me
106:21 - so i would just ask you know officially
106:24 - if
106:24 - i'm giving advice let's just ask and it
106:27 - makes it easier
106:28 - i generally ask at the end though so
106:30 - they're not weirded out
106:32 - um if you're if you're doing a call with
106:33 - strangers i would do the whole call and
106:35 - at the end i'll be like oh my god this
106:36 - was a great call
106:37 - by the way this is gonna i'm gonna put
106:39 - it on youtube is that cool with you
106:41 - and then they're gonna be like yeah
106:42 - that's cool with me and you're like okay
106:44 - okay just be careful be careful there's
106:46 - like kids in there or stuff like that
106:48 - like youtube
106:49 - does not like that stuff you gotta be
106:50 - really careful yeah so
106:52 - just probably you know um
106:55 - [Music]
106:57 - again again if you're not doing
106:58 - something crazy
107:00 - right if it's like not questionable
107:04 - content if you're just like whatever
107:06 - i think you're going to be fine all
107:08 - right just at the as long as at the end
107:10 - you can ask but i mean just
107:12 - whatever you're doing prank calls try to
107:14 - prank call somebody who's over the age
107:16 - of 18. you know don't prank call
107:17 - you're not about the playing cards at
107:19 - all um it's actually educational
107:22 - okay and second question if i like
107:25 - like soundtrack or music or something
107:28 - and i want to put it on my background
107:30 - video yeah uh because i tried to do that
107:33 - and youtube blocked me immediately so
107:36 - how can i get that um license
107:40 - or epidemic sounds
107:43 - epidemic sounds yeah i use epidemic
107:45 - sounds for
107:46 - all my music even the music right now
107:49 - that i'm doing right so it's like this
107:51 - music
107:53 - right or this one
107:58 - these are copyrighted free music this is
108:00 - not
108:01 - drake or something like that the reason
108:03 - is i'm streaming this video to youtube
108:05 - now if i had some other music this video
108:08 - would get shut down right away
108:10 - but because it's copyrighted free music
108:12 - i have a license to it i pay for
108:13 - epidemic sounds
108:15 - uh it's gonna be good
108:18 - but this particular if i like like i i
108:20 - have like a
108:21 - music which i really really love and i
108:23 - want to be on that
108:26 - you can't i mean you
108:30 - maybe maybe you could but then you i
108:33 - think you have to
108:34 - know that that video cannot get
108:36 - monetized so as long as you're okay with
108:38 - that then maybe
108:39 - i think you can that's one thing i
108:41 - always forget i
108:42 - like if you give up your rights for
108:44 - monetization
108:46 - i believe you can have whatever song you
108:48 - want playing in the back
108:49 - i think david david dubrick
108:52 - does that
108:57 - like there are people uh like who
109:01 - post lyrics of a a song
109:04 - and then play the song behind it yeah so
109:07 - they don't get copied rediane says
109:10 - qazi in my country youtube partners uh
109:13 - monetization is not supported do you
109:15 - think it will hold me back of doing
109:16 - youtube absolutely not
109:18 - i mean most of the times unless you're
109:19 - in like finance industry or something
109:21 - crazy
109:22 - how much youtube monetization is like
109:24 - pennies compared to like
109:27 - like it's not it just doesn't pay you
109:29 - almost
109:30 - any money so i wouldn't worry too much
109:34 - about that
109:34 - i would try to make my income from
109:37 - actually having a product or a service
109:40 - or
109:40 - even like doing lessons with those
109:43 - people or group coaching with those
109:44 - people
109:45 - like hey i'll charge you 15 an hour
109:48 - but like group of five or 10 people you
109:50 - know all of a sudden you're making 150
109:52 - an hour because there's 10 people in
109:53 - that group session that's like really
109:55 - cheap right 15
109:56 - is really really cheap to coach somebody
109:58 - but i'm just saying this so if you're
110:00 - new and you're like how do i start
110:02 - you could you know then later as time
110:05 - progresses now i'm charging people
110:06 - between 500
110:08 - to 2 000 for an hour of my time but
110:11 - i couldn't in the start so in the start
110:14 - do whatever you need to do to be able to
110:16 - make that income um
110:18 - and be able to make a living off of it
110:20 - so then you can actually just go full
110:21 - time and all in
110:26 - because i just wanted to ask a quick
110:28 - question uh
110:29 - which mac or and a camera should i
110:32 - english
110:33 - um i mean i mean if you can afford it
110:36 - the new mac is out i think with the m1
110:38 - chip or whatever
110:39 - i want to get that i'm super i got my
110:41 - eyes on it
110:42 - so you could you could spend it on that
110:45 - um
110:45 - or something cheaper and um
110:49 - to wait for the 16 inch sure so yeah you

115:31 - it in the
115:32 - air table right now you want to do it in
115:33 - the air table yeah what do you guys
115:35 - think
115:36 - if we added it to the uh air table that
115:39 - we have today and we made one field in
115:41 - there for
115:42 - like one of your youtube videos do you
115:45 - guys think it like
115:46 - um i think the channel uh
115:49 - okay i i think we already have a channel
115:51 - link field there
115:53 - so uh we can just reference that for
115:56 - people like we can just have a check
115:57 - mark for people who want to
115:59 - take that review during the seminar
116:02 - since we already have a channel feel you
116:03 - can just go there uh because
116:05 - youtube also we have to do oh okay
116:09 - harman is saying the channel link is
116:11 - already there
116:12 - so he said how about like to the air
116:14 - table we just add like a little check
116:16 - mark button if they want a review of
116:18 - their videos
116:20 - yeah like would you like us to give a
116:22 - feedback on your yeah
116:24 - i think yeah youtube channel and then
116:26 - maybe they can and maybe we can just
116:28 - have like one last thing anything
116:30 - else you want to let us know and maybe
116:31 - they can be like our my last video give
116:33 - me a review on my last video
116:35 - right okay so basically just a check
116:38 - mark and then just like anything else
116:41 - comment field and a check mark okay cool
116:44 - we'll add that to the homework
116:45 - um for you guys and it'll just be an
116:48 - optional thing is that cool with you
116:49 - guys
116:51 - yeah okay yeah awesome awesome because
116:54 - what i can do
116:55 - if you guys actually want what i can do
116:58 - is like i can literally make a video
117:00 - review personally by me
117:02 - for each and every one of you and then
117:04 - actually send it to you so if you
117:06 - want an actual review and you want to
117:08 - know for a specific video
117:10 - you can let us know in that anything
117:12 - else you want us to know
117:14 - section and i can make a personalized
117:16 - video and send it to you guys
117:19 - cool nice okay that would be awesome
117:22 - okay great
117:23 - so then you get personalized feedback
117:26 - dope awesome awesome awesome
117:27 - great um okay other than that
117:31 - i think we took on the questions i don't
117:34 - know if there was anybody else like i
117:35 - don't know aldo were you raising your
117:37 - hand at any point
117:39 - yes yes go for it i will disable the
117:41 - video because of the audio
117:43 - uh i think that this guy kali
117:47 - uh kali hogan do you think that
117:50 - the success of this guy is because how
117:53 - he looks
117:54 - the percentage is because of the setup
117:58 - or the programs he made um i think it's
118:01 - how he makes his videos and tells his
118:04 - stories yes
118:07 - yes because his videos are like really
118:09 - good uh b-rolls right
118:11 - yeah so like for example what's the when
118:13 - you watch his working on a project right
118:15 - he'll be like okay today we're gonna do
118:16 - a build on something
118:18 - he's not necessarily going to a full
118:20 - tutorial where you can watch it and you
118:21 - just
118:22 - get exactly how to do it it's more like
118:24 - storytelling
118:25 - so it's like he's one part of his day
118:27 - then he cuts to like some of it built
118:29 - then he gives you a little this is where
118:30 - i'm at
118:31 - so you can kind of sit back and watch it
118:33 - like a movie
118:34 - and at the end of those 20 or 30 minutes
118:36 - you feel like you built the app
118:38 - so that's the cool thing about it so if
118:40 - you want to model his
118:41 - thing that's what it's like it's more
118:43 - like telling a story and
118:45 - getting the other person to go on a
118:46 - journey with you
118:48 - okay thanks yes you got it um
118:52 - alex okay i thought alexandro do you
118:54 - have a question
118:58 - okay i thought you had a quote okay got
119:01 - it nice nice
119:02 - uh okay clara i just wanted to know what
119:06 - time
119:07 - is there a deadline tonight for when the
119:09 - um
119:10 - the assignment is due i think for the
119:14 - deadline of the assignment let's make it
119:15 - midnight tonight so
119:17 - right now where i'm at in california
119:19 - it's 1 19 p.m
119:21 - so let's make it you know whatever is
119:23 - that
119:24 - like 10 hours 11 hours left kind of so
119:27 - almost 11 hours
119:28 - so in 11 hours let's submit this awesome
119:31 - thank you
119:32 - okay great and again guys for the video
119:35 - make sure it's
119:36 - landscape so when i say landscape it
119:39 - means not a vertical video
119:41 - a horizontal video okay and if you want
119:44 - to make this video really cool
119:46 - you could have your computer or your
119:48 - youtube channel open actually that'll be
119:50 - really cool
119:51 - if you can have your youtube channel
119:52 - open up behind you with all your videos
119:55 - okay or just the name of your youtube
119:57 - channel if you don't have any videos so
119:59 - you could have that in the framing
120:01 - so like literally you know right behind
120:04 - you and you can be like toss
120:05 - you can be talking at the camera and
120:06 - then the camera's showing you and right
120:08 - behind you'll be showing your entire
120:09 - setup
120:11 - if that makes sense dope dope
120:14 - cool i have one more question go for it
120:17 - clara
120:18 - i don't know if if anybody can help me
120:19 - because i was trying to
120:21 - set up my youtube channel but apparently
120:23 - when i set up my
120:24 - youtube channel i didn't do a business
120:26 - or a brand account
120:28 - and um so i'm just trying to make my
120:31 - current youtube channel be
120:33 - um so they wanted me to make a whole new
120:35 - youtube channel
120:36 - and i already have subscribers on
120:41 - um i think you can keep it going
120:43 - honestly i don't think it's like
120:45 - that big of a deal if you don't have
120:47 - that many subscribers and you don't care
120:49 - just start a new one but if you've
120:50 - already started i wouldn't worry about
120:52 - it too much you should be fine
120:54 - okay yeah like there's there's not much
120:57 - that you get out of it that's
120:58 - crazy like i think the only thing that
121:00 - you get out of it is maybe you can add
121:02 - in other people who can manage your
121:03 - youtube channel
121:06 - so like you know if you want to add in
121:08 - an editor but you don't want to give
121:09 - them
121:10 - access to your password something small
121:12 - like that
121:13 - so so there's not much crazy benefits
121:16 - you're going to get out of it
121:17 - you'll still have your analytics you'll
121:18 - still be able to monetize it you'll
121:20 - still be able to do everything that
121:22 - pretty much anybody can do it's just
121:25 - that when i wanted to change
121:26 - my name um it still wanted a
121:30 - first and a last name and it's like i
121:32 - had a different
121:33 - idea for a name got it and i can't
121:36 - change it do you
121:37 - i mean can you is it is it too um
121:40 - how far are you into your channel let's
121:42 - just say how many videos do you have how
121:43 - many subscribers you
121:44 - i don't i just started you guys you
121:46 - inspired me so i haven't even made my
121:48 - first one but i'm going to
121:50 - okay so maybe maybe now it might be just
121:52 - a good time to start a new one then if
121:53 - you want to just start it and name it a
121:55 - certain way and you want all that access
121:56 - just go for it
121:58 - i did do that so okay beautiful

123:15 - looking a little funny
123:18 - let's go do it hey guys welcome to my
123:21 - channel
123:23 - i want to talk to you about sleep or i
123:26 - love your energy
123:27 - the thumbnail is awful
123:31 - i want you to work on your [ __ ]
123:32 - thumbnail okay
123:35 - if your thumbnail is good your video is
123:37 - going to get a lot of views so look at
123:38 - more sleepy videos okay
123:40 - so let's type in sleep uh if
123:43 - i type in something with sleep i'm gonna
123:45 - see thumbnails
123:48 - um these are pretty weird [ __ ]
123:49 - thumbnails too but that's fine
123:55 - but you can't go wrong with this funny
123:57 - ones but because i'm injured it was hard
124:00 - to make them happen
124:01 - so hold on what is your video sleep
124:03 - disturbed
124:04 - so what are you trying to say what maybe
124:06 - let's come up with a better idea for the
124:08 - video the
124:09 - better title so you're what's your main
124:12 - idea in the video
124:13 - are you basically um yeah introducing
124:15 - the idea of my guy friends reading
124:17 - bedtime stories
124:19 - okay cool that usually is not gonna do
124:22 - well as a video because
124:24 - i think it's a great video because you
124:26 - made it so that's good
124:27 - you should give yourself props but it's
124:28 - not like nobody's going to watch it or
124:30 - care or have any idea or context as to
124:32 - what's happening
124:33 - so generally videos like that won't
124:36 - really do that well until
124:38 - of course you have a big subscriber base
124:39 - that starts to care then they'll care
124:42 - um is there any other is there like a
124:45 - valuable idea that if somebody watches
124:47 - it they get value out of it
124:49 - well if you scroll to the middle of the
124:51 - video you actually will hear
124:52 - the beginning of one of the stories uh
124:55 - you literally will see it
124:57 - switch to just a still shot okay
125:00 - so then you can actually hear my
125:02 - friend's voice she woke suddenly
125:04 - again was she dreaming was he actually

128:37 - it's okay i think if it's working it's
128:40 - working that's great these are great
128:41 - views
128:42 - for a sleeping channel and you know
128:44 - telling stories they're doing a great
128:46 - job so i would
128:47 - few things i think you will win on
128:51 - tick-tock and instagram reels and i
128:54 - think you can win
128:55 - on youtube so if they can make those
128:58 - videos
128:58 - all you need is simple b-roll i like the
129:01 - b-roll that these guys have oh it's
129:03 - actually literally the same video they
129:05 - use for every video you're noticing that
129:07 - yeah it's like yeah he got like one
129:10 - license and he's
129:11 - using that yeah yeah yeah
129:13 - [Laughter]
129:14 - this feels like uh that game memory
129:16 - tiles you know where you like match the
129:19 - [Laughter]
129:21 - match which two match i'm winning i'm
129:25 - winning with 100 accuracy so
129:28 - this is a good one to model make your
129:31 - title something like this
129:33 - thumbnails look like this and then with
129:35 - the voiceover i think that will do well
129:38 - okay model it closely better mic
129:43 - and yeah i think that will be good okay
129:46 - yep dope okay cool great job melissa
129:50 - thank you everybody give it up for
129:51 - melissa
129:54 - nice work nice job nice work okay
129:58 - victor you're raising your hands do you
130:01 - want to go
130:01 - it's just for just for the for the roast
130:04 - yeah okay
130:05 - drop your link let's go and what type of
130:07 - roast are you looking for
130:09 - as dark as possible all right cool let's
130:11 - go bro
130:13 - um all right here we go
130:16 - so when i looked at your video yesterday
130:19 - something was funny about it
130:21 - it was pretty good but let me actually
130:24 - which one did you send me yesterday was
130:26 - it one of these uh
130:27 - excessive thinking yes uh with the
130:29 - drawing with the drawing
130:31 - oh okay the third one yeah this one
130:34 - there's something about the
130:36 - is it shot in a normal aspect ratio
130:40 - like it looks i was using my tablet and
130:42 - i i was
130:43 - the ratio was uh was weird but i
130:45 - corrected that for for the next ones
130:47 - yeah
130:47 - yeah so stay away from these ratios i
130:49 - think youtube really [ __ ] freaks out
130:51 - when it has like weird ratios like those
130:52 - videos it tries to kill for some reason
130:54 - just like on instagram if you go
130:57 - landscape on a picture it [ __ ]
130:59 - dies it never does well but if you go
131:02 - square on instagram it always wins so
131:05 - on youtube make sure that the format is
131:08 - right because otherwise youtube will
131:09 - freak out
131:10 - and i think people also like when i
131:11 - first saw it i'm like what is this what
131:13 - the [ __ ] am i watching get me out of
131:14 - here
131:15 - in this video i'm gonna show you mike
131:19 - how existed
131:23 - mike really important so you hear that
131:25 - hum that noise in the background
131:29 - right that makes me want to also run
131:31 - away so make sure
131:33 - that your mic and that hum is not there
131:35 - again
131:36 - i know you're shooting it with the
131:38 - tablet
131:40 - um or i know you can afford a
131:43 - yeti right so try actually i have my my
131:46 - i use my yeti mic actually i don't know
131:47 - what happened for this video
131:49 - you might have the gain really high then
131:51 - oh i see that's it
131:54 - in this video i'm gonna show you how you
131:57 - can become
131:58 - more peaceful okay um
132:01 - also one thing i want to make sure
132:04 - that's happening is you
132:08 - i like that it's dark outside so that's
132:10 - good but
132:11 - it almost looks like you're kind of not
132:13 - in focus it looks like a little blurry
132:15 - i think that's just because it's yeah
132:17 - it's eye patches
132:18 - yeah yeah yeah happy and smarter than
132:21 - ever
132:23 - and the concept i want to introduce to
132:25 - you today is a concept of
132:27 - presence so what is presence so let's
132:30 - dive in
132:31 - so we have this timeline
132:34 - let me use some blue so we have all
132:37 - those points here
132:38 - on the left music i would go down a
132:40 - little bit it's like
132:42 - too competing with your voice so like
132:44 - where the music starts to go really high
132:47 - i'll i'll i would pull that down because
132:49 - right now it's
132:50 - way louder than your actual voice
132:53 - and on the right so bots
132:56 - [Music]
132:59 - have really is this uh
133:04 - in everything you do
133:07 - okay so overall i think a great idea
133:10 - a great type of video i know what type
133:13 - of market you're in
133:15 - i think you're gonna do really well i
133:16 - mean frankie was looking at it too he
133:17 - thought it was real it was really cool
133:19 - and it's a really cool idea to draw this
133:20 - type of stuff out
133:22 - let me look at this in this video i'm
133:25 - gonna show you the secret
133:27 - nice this is like that default music
133:29 - that comes with like final cut pro
133:31 - i love it insanely productive again
133:34 - music a little bit lower because you're
133:35 - speaking
133:36 - the secret you're yeti i think so a few
133:39 - things yeti is not a
133:41 - mic you point to yourself so don't point
133:44 - it to yourself
133:45 - yeti is like a cardioid mic so you want
133:47 - to make sure it's straight up and you
133:49 - are really close to it
133:51 - because it's not picking up the audio
133:54 - from here
133:55 - it's actually picking up the audio from
133:57 - here see what i'm saying
133:59 - okay so you actually want to keep it
134:01 - straight up straight up
134:03 - not pointing to you straight up and go
134:05 - close to it and talk
134:07 - also i would reduce the gain to almost
134:09 - zero
134:10 - because it's still a lot of gain threat
134:14 - is this
134:17 - so the number one okay insanely
134:19 - productive
134:20 - the secret is this
134:25 - so the number one tool for being
134:28 - productive
134:29 - is deadlines we all
134:32 - have experience this magical night
134:35 - before an exam
134:36 - you know suddenly before and more
134:41 - and if you add all the little bug in in
134:44 - the us
134:46 - so the it moves too slow in the start
134:50 - so move it way fast like okay this i
134:53 - really like that you have this human
134:54 - life this human life calendar looks
134:57 - freaking awesome
134:59 - and it's really cool to visualize this
135:01 - over here
135:02 - i would move i would make the video more
135:05 - like
135:06 - it hooks you in the start so maybe a
135:09 - little bit more faster paced maybe the
135:11 - music a little bit lower so i can hear
135:12 - you better and then whatever you want to
135:14 - hit me with
135:15 - give me a much stronger hook because
135:17 - that
135:18 - really really works so like for you i
135:21 - would say like
135:22 - study some of videos from andrew kirby
135:25 - have you ever watched anything from
135:27 - andrew kirby uh nope
135:29 - okay so uh do you watch any alex becker
135:33 - uh not really okay cool so
135:36 - here is andrew kirby right so like let's
135:38 - say i spent 50 000
135:41 - on fake gurus here's what i learned
135:46 - [Music]
135:48 - right
135:51 - all right over the past couple of years
135:54 - i've spent fifty thousand dollars on
135:56 - internet gurus i've bought a fifty
135:58 - dollar course an eighty dollar course a
135:59 - nine hundred ninety seven dollar course
136:01 - a fifteen hundred dollar course at two
136:02 - thousand five 500
136:03 - course a couple around the 10 000 mark
136:05 - and finally a 25 000
136:08 - course and i know what you're thinking
136:10 - this sounds
136:11 - absolutely crazy but hear me out let me
136:14 - explain
136:14 - this is what i've learned so it all
136:16 - started a few years ago that's a
136:18 - fantastic intro and hook right yeah it's
136:21 - so good
136:22 - that is so good that is what you guys
136:25 - want your interest
136:26 - be like i mean that is phenomenal
136:29 - if you can have your intro like this
136:32 - you're gonna
136:32 - crush so like if you even for this video
136:35 - i almost imagine like dramatic music
136:38 - um like i have an example of one where i
136:41 - have some dramatic
136:42 - music going um it's my
136:46 - it's my ad which i think you guys have
136:48 - seen
136:49 - i don't actually if you've seen it or
136:50 - not biggest
136:52 - opportunity or developers clever
136:56 - programmer
136:57 - so like here's how the hook of this one
136:59 - is
137:01 - what the heck is up with all these
137:03 - coding channels on youtube
137:05 - we've got clever programmer jomatech
137:07 - tech lead free code cam code drip
137:09 - traversing media corey shaffer and the
137:11 - list just goes on i believe what we
137:13 - discovered is
137:14 - so you see what i'm saying how it hooks
137:16 - you right in the start
137:19 - so like your videos for you i would have
137:23 - something along the lines of
137:25 - like i would make it a little bit more
137:27 - dramatic maybe in the start
137:29 - and i would have the concept of human
137:31 - calendar
137:32 - come up just a little bit even if you
137:34 - don't fully get into it you can have it
137:36 - come up a little bit because i think
137:37 - that's like a really good angle
137:39 - and i i pay attention to them oh [ __ ]
137:42 - like my whole life is being visualized
137:44 - on the screen right here
137:45 - and then you can get into your video
137:47 - from there so you can talk about like
137:49 - what you're going to cover in this video
137:50 - and then you can get to it
137:53 - other than that brother i think your
137:55 - channel has a lot of potential
137:57 - i think this has actually it's a it's a
137:59 - it's a very messy you see uh
138:01 - there's mathematical proofs and uh and
138:03 - stuff like that so
138:04 - oh [ __ ] i like like a personal
138:06 - development
138:08 - data science and uh and trading yeah so
138:11 - i put a bit of everything
138:12 - uh in that in that so yeah
138:16 - yeah for now i'm trying to combine uh
138:19 - finance trading with personal
138:20 - development
138:21 - for example my latest uh video that i
138:23 - just uploaded like
138:24 - during this call welcome in this video
138:26 - i'm gonna show you how traders manage
138:28 - the risk
138:29 - and how it can be applied to your own
138:31 - life even though you're not in finance
138:33 - so the stuff that will make you improve
138:35 - these
138:36 - and i get it it's okay i think sometimes
138:38 - you can go in different directions and
138:40 - your videos can still bang if they're
138:41 - good
138:43 - uh the only thing i'll recommend is
138:45 - making sure in the start
138:47 - at the very least you can add b-roll or
138:50 - you can add images coming up on the
138:53 - screen
138:53 - even that's another good hack you can do
138:55 - so if you're talking about traders
138:57 - maybe like a b-roll of somebody doing
138:59 - day trading can come up
139:00 - or an image of somebody doing day
139:03 - trading can come up
139:04 - those are also really good i said
139:07 - okay i don't think it's too much of a
139:09 - problem even if you're going in a little
139:11 - bit different directions i think it's
139:12 - better if you stick to one thing if you
139:13 - can
139:14 - um it's like now i'm combining like uh
139:18 - trading and personal development so it's
139:20 - like uh yeah
139:21 - i start explaining the the concepts in
139:23 - finance but in the end i'm like uh
139:24 - talking about ecartolio stuff like that
139:26 - you know oh
139:27 - [ __ ] i love it so [ __ ] nuts but i
139:29 - love it
139:30 - you have a so here's what i would say
139:33 - make sure you're picking titles that
139:34 - have potential to be found
139:36 - these these ideas don't have the
139:38 - potential to be
139:40 - found so they're like really good if i'm
139:44 - already
139:46 - um kind of on your channel i might find
139:49 - it otherwise i don't think it might come
139:51 - up
139:52 - so try to also pick some titles where
139:54 - you can really be found so for example
139:57 - examples of titles where you can really
139:58 - be found is like
140:00 - i tried day trading for 30 days
140:03 - here's what happened
140:06 - i tried being insanely productive for 30
140:10 - days here's what happened so some of
140:11 - those
140:12 - you'll see those um i tried 30 days
140:15 - there's like this whole trend with this
140:17 - [ __ ] that works like alicia was here
140:19 - yesterday and he had a video that blew
140:20 - up with this type of [ __ ]
140:22 - so you can do that type of stuff you can
140:24 - you can study andrew kirby and sam evans
140:26 - and alex becker they're very simple
140:28 - i'm here brother i'm here oh okay
140:30 - beautiful
140:32 - um you can study you can study alex
140:35 - becker
140:36 - and andrew kirby and sam evans they're
140:39 - very cerebral and analytical
140:41 - people just like you and they're also
140:43 - kind of do talking about stuff like that
140:45 - you're talking about i think
140:46 - that can help you blow up if you try to
140:48 - model them okay oh cool
140:50 - cool yeah thanks was the advice all
140:51 - right brother you got it
140:53 - thank you yo man we got into that one
140:56 - nice uh let's go with
141:01 - i'm gonna go with kelvin let's go with
141:03 - kelvin
141:08 - all right all right and guys let's give
141:10 - it up for
141:11 - who was here i forgot who did we just do
141:13 - right now victor all right guys let's
141:15 - give it up for victor hey
141:19 - all right cool how to host a website for
141:22 - free
141:23 - under five minutes holy [ __ ] bro i just
141:25 - saw the intro and
141:27 - that looks good so thumbnail
141:30 - is good
141:34 - there's something slightly weird about
141:37 - it
141:37 - i don't know
141:39 - [Music]
141:41 - it's good it's not sick
141:44 - um i think
141:49 - maybe two fonts maybe too much text
141:51 - maybe no logos of something that you're
141:53 - talking about
141:54 - a little font and the background uh
141:57 - i think i don't know there's something
141:59 - about it i would need to play with it a
142:00 - little bit but other than that it's
142:02 - decent okay it's a decent
142:03 - decent thumbnail decent start let me
142:05 - click on it hey there guys my name is
142:07 - kelvin welcome to negro tech
142:09 - today i'm going to show you how to host
142:10 - your basic [ __ ] junior dev website
142:13 - audio is too low i would increase the
142:15 - audio so like
142:16 - that part is bad so in increase your
142:20 - audio up
142:21 - uh yeah i just was just a test just to
142:23 - see how
142:24 - i can you know talk in front of the
142:26 - camera got it i'll get
142:27 - all the all the devices the camera the
142:30 - yeti mic
142:31 - i'll also get this got it got it got it
142:33 - okay
142:35 - in just five minutes you know what say
142:38 - less wrote the intro
142:40 - hey that's [ __ ] clean
142:43 - [Music]
142:48 - um
142:57 - i'm signing off oh my god
143:01 - all right all right so here's what i
143:03 - would say okay
143:05 - energy is amazing your smile is amazing
143:08 - so keep your face in front of the
143:10 - [ __ ] camera always
143:12 - so i love that i actually even like how
143:14 - you what your background is there's a
143:16 - lot of cool texture
143:18 - so it kind of pops you out
143:22 - i love how you roll the intro
143:25 - man that's really cool
143:29 - like you put that little cap on the
143:30 - camera roll the intro
143:33 - here here's what i'll tell you when i
143:35 - want the intro to be over okay so i'll
143:36 - tell you exactly when i
143:38 - want it to be over
143:45 - let's get back into the video here like
143:47 - right there
143:48 - get back in the video so like probably
143:50 - just a few seconds
143:53 - even here okay cool if you get back into
143:57 - the video right about now
143:58 - i can still [ __ ] with it
144:01 - but then now it's already getting too
144:03 - long
144:06 - definitely too long now and then it
144:08 - keeps getting longer and longer so i
144:09 - would
144:10 - keep the intro shorter okay the shorter
144:12 - intros are like what's super hot right
144:15 - now it's like a really
144:16 - clean way to do it look at casey neistat
144:18 - right his
144:19 - intros are like one second long logan
144:22 - paul's vlogs their intro is like one
144:24 - second long when they pop
144:26 - up
144:32 - cool also when the video starts make
144:34 - sure it starts right away so like
144:36 - at 33 seconds when the camera so first
144:39 - of all it shouldn't go to black
144:40 - for a few seconds and then it's like
144:42 - quiet it should cut from
144:44 - here to right where you're speaking
144:48 - and we're back guys
144:51 - because i honestly just started at this
144:53 - thing with adobe premiere today
144:55 - like this video was done about like two
144:58 - hours ago or three hours ago yes
145:00 - everything so i'll work more on that and
145:02 - got it
145:03 - you you wanted a medium rose right yeah
145:06 - yeah so that's why you're getting this
145:08 - because because
145:10 - my honest to god truth is the only thing
145:12 - i want to do is actually give you props
145:15 - like for your first [ __ ] video this
145:17 - is incredible bro
145:20 - sometimes i hate it but when you guys
145:22 - want a medium or a darker roast i kind
145:24 - of have to like say the shitty parts
145:26 - because i don't want to leave you with
145:27 - the shitty parts but if you wanted a
145:28 - medium roast i gotta give you the shitty
145:30 - parts
145:31 - so that's the only reason other than
145:32 - that dude you killed it with this video
145:35 - this is a phenomenal first video
145:37 - phenomenal thumbnail
145:38 - just start doing more okay uh
145:42 - improvements for you mic some of that
145:45 - stuff
145:45 - i know you already got it but like turn
145:48 - your audio
145:48 - up a lot higher other than that
145:51 - phenomenal video
145:52 - thanks so much for jumping on let's give
145:54 - it up guys
145:56 - thank you great job kelvin that was
145:59 - awesome
146:01 - thank you hey nice all right
146:04 - let's go with okay
146:08 - uh i want to see if there are people who
146:11 - i haven't
146:13 - we haven't done much yet see
146:18 - okay all right let's go with
146:23 - aldo
146:26 - hey i'm here all right so
146:30 - medium got it you sent me two videos
146:33 - which one you want me to look at oh i
146:35 - mean you want me to probably look at not
146:36 - the spanish one
146:37 - got it
146:40 - if you want to improve your skills in
146:42 - school or programming
146:44 - the ipad and the surface are really good
146:47 - tools to do that
146:48 - but which one has the best experience
146:51 - let's find out number one wake up speed
146:55 - because i need to study now yeah
146:59 - okay so great
147:02 - video as in great framing uh your energy
147:06 - is looking really great
147:08 - a few things i would improve maybe
147:11 - actually have
147:12 - something on the screens that makes it
147:14 - really visually appealing
147:17 - another thing i would recommend is
147:24 - when you sit closer it's actually a lot
147:27 - better but when you go far away it's not
147:29 - really
147:30 - that great so let me go here so like
147:32 - right now
147:33 - you're blended into the background you
147:36 - see how like
147:38 - you got this prop you got this prop you
147:41 - got this prop you got this prop and it
147:43 - almost seems like you're a prop too
147:44 - because you're like sitting
147:45 - with the things see what i'm saying yes
147:49 - in order to pop out right like look at
147:51 - this framing and then i want you to look
147:53 - at this framing
148:02 - so i want you to take a look at this
148:04 - framing right here how to get your
148:07 - do you see that i'm popping out
148:10 - yes okay so what's the difference
148:13 - between
148:14 - this framing and this framing it makes a
148:16 - big difference right you can see there's
148:17 - a big difference
148:19 - but what is it why am i popping out and
148:21 - you're not popping out
148:23 - because you are maybe the focus
148:27 - yes and i'm very [ __ ] close to the
148:29 - camera yeah
148:30 - too close i'm like really close right
148:34 - and then i still can see the technology
148:35 - that you're using exactly
148:38 - so that stuff is in the background so
148:41 - i would recommend being closer to the
148:43 - camera so when you actually come
148:45 - and the surface are really good tools to
148:47 - do that
148:48 - but which one has the best experience
148:51 - let's find out number one wake up speed
148:55 - click on the ice so this when you come
148:57 - closer it actually starts to look better
149:00 - so i would put you closer um of course
149:03 - there's the equipment right are you
149:05 - gonna get better equipment
149:07 - yes well i have right now the c920s pro
149:12 - so scene so c9 i don't know how to use
149:15 - it
149:16 - so c920 the logitech camera it's really
149:19 - good for
149:20 - screencast tutorials where your screen
149:22 - is really small like when your
149:24 - screen is this small in the top right or
149:26 - top left
149:27 - or whatever right bottom right corner
149:29 - but if you're shooting c920 to do this
149:32 - full screen video it's gonna not look
149:33 - that great
149:35 - okay so like
149:38 - if you can afford it i would highly
149:40 - recommend investing into an actual
149:42 - camera
149:44 - okay yeah i will look forward to for
149:47 - your next videos and
149:48 - tutorials about the equipment okay in
149:51 - the next training i'll have
149:53 - all the equipment ready for you okay
149:55 - please okay
149:56 - yep you got it so i would have that for
149:59 - your audio
150:00 - you're using your computer's audio right
150:04 - the the c9020 mic
150:07 - yeah so that's why it doesn't sound good
150:09 - because
150:10 - it's an ipad it's all right and now
150:13 - look at the difference here's the here's
150:16 - the thing it makes such a
150:17 - [ __ ] crazy difference you're talking
150:19 - saying important stuff but now listen to
150:21 - this
150:21 - how to get your first 1 000 subscribers
150:25 - do you guys feel the difference yeah
150:28 - yeah of course
150:29 - it's [ __ ] crazy well what
150:32 - where it was located there the mic in
150:35 - your
150:36 - shot in your foot okay i i cheated on
150:39 - this one
150:40 - so here's actually what i did for this
150:41 - one i
150:43 - um i shot it with the cameras mic
150:46 - right i shot it with the cameras mic
150:50 - but then i realized that that camera
150:52 - camera's mic is like garbage
150:54 - it's not that good it's like the the
150:57 - audio quality isn't that great
150:58 - so then i actually sat down on my actual
151:01 - mic and
151:02 - did a dub like i dubbed it
151:06 - wow that's a lot of work how yeah but
151:10 - but it's just for one thing how to get
151:11 - your first 1000 subscribers that's it so
151:13 - it's just okay
151:14 - yeah so it's like how to get your first
151:17 - 1 000 subscribers
151:19 - let's talk about it right if you really
151:22 - pay attention you can't
151:22 - see it now yeah you cannot see it now
151:24 - right how to get your first
151:26 - one it's like if you like look at my
151:28 - face i know
151:30 - it's off a little bit yeah it's off a
151:32 - little bit so you'll see it if i tell
151:34 - you
151:34 - but if i don't tell you you won't notice
151:36 - it and on a phone you're very unlikely
151:38 - to notice it if you're watching it
151:40 - i notice it because i'm watching it
151:41 - right now on a 60-inch tv you know how
151:43 - and i know about it
151:45 - to get your first but who is there
151:48 - when it's 1 000
151:52 - you see how even though i'm not saying
151:54 - the craziest things on the planet
151:56 - my video really pops out and makes you
151:58 - want to watch it
152:00 - yeah yeah because of the energy is
152:02 - projected yes
152:04 - so if you are if you even have better
152:07 - equipment where your audio quality is
152:09 - just solid
152:11 - and if you're popping out more visually
152:13 - in the frame
152:14 - just few of those things can help you
152:17 - like
152:17 - win and crush it okay sometimes oh
152:20 - things
152:21 - yes exactly so sometimes it doesn't
152:23 - require
152:24 - you like it doesn't really require too
152:26 - many crazy things just few of those
152:28 - things can make you pop
152:29 - and you can have the same type of feel
152:31 - that my video has
152:33 - yes yes i can see it now thanks thanks a
152:35 - lot yeah this is my
152:36 - pressing a button thing windows and also
152:40 - think about wake up time speed no
152:45 - number two take notes and bring
152:48 - your ideas to life fast
152:51 - i like your energy you have really good
152:53 - energy what i would say is just
152:55 - push there's you're again like similar
152:58 - to frank
153:00 - ramos you have good energy
153:03 - i know you got it there's just something
153:05 - on camera that you're holding
153:06 - back give more of that okay
153:10 - so the same thing that like at your
153:12 - corporate job they're [ __ ] sucking
153:13 - your soul
153:15 - it's completely okay to just let that
153:17 - part out
153:18 - on the video like where in your
153:20 - corporate job you might have to
153:22 - hold that like few percent of you back
153:24 - on this video let a few percent of that
153:26 - out a little bit more
153:28 - because i can tell your energy is really
153:29 - great i just want a little bit more
153:32 - okay okay i got it you got it awesome
153:37 - maybe and if you um and pick up some
153:41 - kind of software to edit
153:43 - so right now i think you just shot it
153:45 - and then you uploaded it which is cool
153:47 - but i think if you can find uh final cut
153:50 - pro
153:50 - or you can even use a software like
153:52 - video leap on your phone
153:54 - you can shoot the video and make it more
153:56 - fun
153:58 - okay like you can edit it and take out
154:00 - the uh
154:02 - what's up i use imovie
154:05 - okay so yeah you can cut the pauses in
154:08 - there
154:11 - yeah okay faster yeah yeah like make it
154:14 - a little bit faster so like for example
154:18 - uh say i take something right so like
154:21 - you can take still talking shots and
154:24 - make them like pretty interesting
154:26 - so let me take something that i have
154:29 - let's see if i have some kind of footage
154:30 - in here that's
154:31 - useful so
154:37 - is it this not this
154:53 - okay i'm trying to find a still of
154:58 - like a shot where i'm kind of just like
155:00 - talking for a second so like let's
155:01 - oh that's really hard for me to change
155:03 - being in bed and like doing great things
155:05 - what's easy to do so let's take this one
155:08 - right
155:08 - this one looks like a pretty um regular
155:12 - not very exciting clip of me would you
155:14 - guys agree just like me kind of talking
155:16 - yeah
155:18 - yeah yeah sure so let's just click this
155:20 - and we'll just say
155:21 - um white yt day five
155:26 - and i'm gonna throw this in there so
155:28 - we're gonna watch this good morning you
155:30 - guys
155:30 - that's when i text my girlfriend i was
155:31 - like hey i'm gonna be lazy i'm gonna
155:33 - watch shit's creek
155:34 - i'm gonna eat food in bed i'm gonna like
155:38 - just do everything in bed like watch
155:40 - shows and just relax and
155:42 - take a day off but i realized wow
155:46 - it's kind of right like out of a 1 out
155:49 - of a 10
155:50 - what would you guys give this like this
155:52 - is probably like
155:53 - four kind of in terms of watching it
155:55 - it's kind of like yeah right
155:57 - you guys feel that yeah kind of it's
156:00 - just like me talking not the craziest
156:02 - energy doesn't really
156:04 - so now watch what happens
156:15 - so this is
156:21 - shit's creek wow that's really hard for
156:23 - me to change being in bed and like doing
156:25 - great things what's easy to do
156:27 - is by changing my location going out
156:29 - somewhere i'm gonna be going to bricks
156:30 - and scones and there i
156:32 - always feel great so i'm much more
156:35 - likely to do great things there
156:36 - here are the non-negotiables that i
156:38 - gotta do one i check the sales and the
156:40 - ads
156:40 - two edit the vlog three workout or
156:43 - shower
156:44 - yeah other than that i can relax all
156:46 - right
156:48 - so by something simple i can give you
156:51 - guys
156:51 - even if you have a talking shot like you
156:55 - just talking at the camera
156:58 - if you add in simple things like punch
157:00 - in and punch out so you guys see how
157:01 - like
157:02 - this is a little bit more punched
157:04 - punched in and zoomed in and then this
157:06 - is like zoomed out
157:09 - yes yes i can see that right you can
157:11 - actually do that when you're editing
157:12 - like i can for example take this thing
157:14 - hit this button and just like zoom it in
157:17 - a little bit
157:18 - and now this entire shot is going to be
157:20 - like you're going to break some scones
157:21 - see what i'm saying is life what's up
157:25 - movement it creates life yes you
157:28 - are using a steel shot it's like boring
157:31 - but the same shot
157:32 - with movement yeah it gives some more
157:35 - life exactly so you can add more life
157:39 - simply by like for example if you're
157:40 - talking and there's images popping up
157:42 - that gives it more life
157:44 - if you have text if the if it's
157:47 - changing as in it's like punching and
157:48 - punching out it gives it more life
157:51 - so for your video i would say something
157:53 - similar like add a little bit
157:54 - more context like whether images or text
157:57 - popping up
157:58 - about what you're saying a great place
158:00 - to start is simply images popping up as
158:02 - what you're talking about
158:04 - then the second great place is cut all
158:06 - the garbage out
158:07 - there's going to be a ton of like random
158:10 - [ __ ] that you're saying
158:11 - cut that out and once you cut that out
158:13 - then it's really really good
158:16 - oh okay i used a teleprompter so i was
158:20 - kind of uh keep track of the time
158:23 - because got it that i used got it okay
158:27 - all right that's fine i mean i recommend
158:29 - make sure you're doing it in a way where
158:30 - your energy you can give your energy
158:32 - so like yeah if you can maybe do bullet
158:34 - points but then like speak on it
158:36 - but that's okay if you're using a
158:37 - teleprompter other than that great job
158:39 - okay
158:39 - let's give it up for all though guys
158:41 - nice work
158:42 - hey awesome
158:46 - love it love it love it okay
158:49 - every time i say love it love it i love
158:50 - it i always have to say gordon love it
158:52 - i don't know why um okay who
158:56 - is next wait melissa
159:05 - uh-huh okay i love it some people it's
159:08 - like they're 4am and they're still
159:09 - watching it that's so cool
159:12 - okay who didn't i not go over
159:15 - yet zach allison okay let's do hold on
159:18 - gabi says
159:19 - gobby is for before that i would love a
159:22 - dark roast on this video because for me
159:24 - it's my best video invest time work and
159:26 - knowledge but it's
159:27 - but is it not okay cool got it it's not
159:31 - the best video on quality but she spent
159:32 - a lot of time and energy on it god let's
159:34 - take a look
159:50 - a you will crush
159:53 - so much if the only thing you invested
159:57 - in gabi was a [ __ ]
159:59 - like awesome mic you will crush so much
160:02 - you have great energy
160:03 - you get this youtube game you get the
160:05 - title
160:06 - i i i can tell you you got the ring
160:09 - light that looks great if your
160:10 - audio because there's so much noise like
160:12 - i can hear the traffic or the cars i
160:14 - don't know what's out there
160:16 - but there's so much hum and noise in the
160:18 - background if that could go away
160:20 - and i could if your voice could pop this
160:22 - would already be such a great video
160:30 - right you hear all that gobby yes
160:33 - i told you it's not the best quality i
160:36 - don't have a
160:37 - mic yes it's just my cell phone okay got
160:39 - it got it
160:46 - when the stand
161:01 - what i love about technical videos is
161:03 - you can barely ever go wrong like with
161:05 - technical videos
161:06 - all you have to do is do a great job of
161:08 - explaining
161:10 - and you don't have to make it a fancy
161:12 - video you don't have to make it like
161:13 - anything special
161:15 - the only thing is what's up with all
161:17 - this space that's not being used here
161:21 - like why is it not full screen like
161:24 - there's tons of space not being used
161:29 - okay
161:35 - yeah export 1920 by 1080 okay
161:40 - so then the whole screen will be shared
161:43 - other than that my
161:45 - my only thing that will make this video
161:46 - great like i said is
161:49 - a better like
161:52 - you know you know this too you're
161:53 - already going to do it just better
161:55 - quality
161:55 - i think we'll make it really good when
161:58 - it comes to
162:00 - you're using windows or mac
162:03 - i'm using mac mac
162:06 - okay usually this how are you doing
162:10 - you're using loom yes i'm listening
162:13 - alone
162:13 - cool and what quality is it recording in
162:18 - it's the freelance i i
162:22 - don't have the chance to to choose so
162:25 - either use loom or use screenflow if you
162:28 - want to do a lot of these technical
162:31 - trainings i would highly recommend using
162:33 - screenflow
162:34 - loom will [ __ ] you up at some point
162:37 - um it's going to be a really frustrating
162:39 - experience you're gonna be 44 minutes
162:40 - into a
162:41 - really really technically difficult
162:43 - video and it's gonna crash on you and
162:45 - it's gonna [ __ ] suck
162:47 - so yes yes i know
162:50 - so stick with screenflow you can edit in
162:52 - it and it is amazing
162:55 - export in 1920 by 1080
162:59 - record in as high of a quality as you
163:02 - can
163:02 - um you know preferably whatever the
163:05 - resolution of your laptop is
163:07 - so recording good quality for the
163:09 - screencast
163:11 - and audio just make it good other than
163:14 - that the only other things you can do
163:16 - is cut pauses and stuff like that out
163:18 - where you're pausing for too much so
163:20 - then
163:20 - you can keep the pace of it moving
163:22 - really fast
163:23 - but great video okay
163:28 - one of my best quality videos can you go
163:31 - to my channel
163:32 - sure second
163:58 - [Music]
164:00 - so great intro i like it
164:07 - i still hear a lot of humming which
164:09 - again is not the end of the world
164:11 - but i think if you mic uh actual mic
164:15 - like a yeti will work better okay
164:18 - it would help if i actually understood
164:20 - what you were saying
164:23 - let's get started
164:25 - [Music]
164:31 - yeah i can still hear like the dudes
164:33 - going on the bike or whatever
164:35 - um so that makes it harder to pay
164:38 - attention to what you're saying
164:40 - okay and uh what i really want to give
164:43 - you feedback on is your
164:44 - is title and your thumbnail uh frankie
164:48 - you know how to read what's going on
164:49 - here so what's
164:52 - muertos doesn't that mean death frankie
164:56 - what does this title say c
164:59 - that does i understand
165:02 - okay what does this say it's something
165:04 - about the terror
165:05 - the terror of the history of finance or
165:08 - what is it or like
165:09 - anti-fraud tips a terror history about
165:12 - finance and that's that guy's that buy
165:15 - are there popular titles around this
165:18 - type of stuff
165:20 - [Music]
165:22 - the last part um so
165:26 - okay so stick to titles that are already
165:29 - banging and stick with more of them
165:31 - that's one big thing i would recommend
165:33 - other than that i think if you just keep
165:35 - going your energy is great you're giving
165:37 - value like i love when people get into
165:40 - the technical [ __ ] like right now
165:42 - right i can't go wrong giving you guys
165:44 - value because i'm like getting
165:46 - into it like i'm screen sharing i'm like
165:49 - technically giving precise information
165:52 - so i can't go wrong
165:53 - my channel is just gonna grow if i do
165:56 - nothing else but this
165:57 - same thing with a lot of you guys who
165:59 - are doing technical stuff you're in a
166:00 - really good place so
166:02 - great work thumbnails i would just
166:06 - again i wish i could read it i could
166:07 - probably give you better advice but um
166:10 - keep going in invest in
166:13 - solid audio quality and then you're
166:15 - you're going to be really good gabi
166:18 - cassie what what is that percentage um
166:22 - can you oh i'm using a a
166:25 - vid iq for that so vid iq shows me the
166:28 - like to dislike percentage so for
166:30 - example this video has 100
166:33 - likes this has 90 likes
166:38 - oh perfect that's awesome thank you
166:40 - that's also on the side
166:42 - you know i have socialblade and that
166:44 - tells me
166:45 - you know how this video did in the last
166:48 - 30 days what's your average subscribers
166:50 - blah blah blah all that stuff
166:53 - okay oh oh yeah so um frankie can you
166:56 - add social blade to the
166:58 - slides with the monitor because i want
167:00 - to talk about that
167:01 - because that's like the greatest
167:04 - thing you guys can actually use so let
167:08 - me show you guys
167:10 - why we're zoom
167:15 - did the call end what the
167:27 - how come where where is zoom
167:30 - no but like look oh i have to hit okay i
167:34 - couldn't see it i couldn't see it all
167:35 - right all right that was a dumb moment
167:36 - on my part
167:38 - all right i couldn't i couldn't see
167:41 - where to hit
167:42 - stop sure what's up with this new chrome
167:45 - update does it
167:46 - is it just me or is it crashing for
167:48 - everybody
167:50 - it's everywhere all the time like it's
167:53 - kind of nuts how much is crashing now
168:01 - all right so socialblade is a great
168:03 - place to go
168:05 - it's probably one of my favorite
168:07 - resources that shows me like how
168:09 - how to get your first whoops oh damn
168:12 - this video is at
168:13 - 800 views if you want to improve
168:16 - yourself
168:17 - so gabi's channel if i go to
168:21 - if i go to her channel it's so annoying
168:25 - like all right gobby
168:34 - okay that's the name of it
168:39 - all right so let's go here and type that
168:42 - in
168:42 - abby there we go
168:47 - all right so on here it's a really good
168:49 - platform it's completely free
168:51 - type in whoever you're looking for click
168:53 - on them and this tells you like how
168:56 - what's going on and then just click see
168:58 - full monthly statistics
169:00 - most channels it won't show if your
169:02 - channel isn't like
169:03 - at least has some views or subscribers
169:05 - behind it like it might not even show it
169:08 - but if you have some views and
169:09 - subscribers they'll show your looks like
169:11 - for example redian is going to show his
169:13 - channel
169:13 - alicia is going to show your channel and
169:16 - it's really good to see
169:17 - how many daily average subscribers
169:19 - you're getting what's your weekly
169:21 - average
169:21 - how this this channel is doing overall i
169:25 - just started my personal
169:26 - brand channel 11 uploads so like if i go
169:29 - here
169:30 - it's not doing too bad 118 subscribers
169:33 - 14 subscribers 5
169:34 - 34 27 59 62 9 5
169:38 - 10. so the real number probably is 9
169:42 - 5 10 because i think all these other
169:45 - days i was promoting it
169:47 - you know so i think that's why i got
169:49 - more but the 9510 that's probably like
169:51 - the real number
169:52 - so i want these like low numbers to
169:54 - improve
169:55 - and as long as they're improving then
169:57 - this channel is going to like
169:58 - start going fast
170:03 - okay gabi was that helpful super helpful
170:07 - thank you very much beautiful all right
170:10 - you got it all right guys give it up for
170:11 - gabi thank you so much for jumping on
170:14 - appreciate you that was
170:15 - amazing all righty let's go with zach
170:19 - elson zach
170:22 - all right let's go with you brother
170:26 - this is your second video yep okay i
170:29 - cannot see what that text
170:31 - is at all i know i need to fix that i uh
170:34 - finish that at four in the morning so i
170:37 - haven't
170:37 - i'll go back and recreate that thumbnail
170:39 - and pop that text out
170:41 - okay great so other than that much i
170:44 - like this thumbnail quite a bit this is
170:46 - pretty cool
170:47 - good job on learning the cutting out
170:49 - that's kind of that's really cool
170:50 - good job
170:54 - hello and welcome welcome to view it you
170:57 - no
170:58 - bro no it's not the right story bro
171:01 - you may have recently moved to ubuntu
171:03 - 2004
171:06 - no bro what is happening your first
171:09 - video is way better
171:10 - [Music]
171:15 - part of it is my webcam is not on my
171:18 - linux box
171:19 - so i have no um camera no no this is not
171:22 - a webcam problem
171:23 - whatever and um you guys
171:27 - stay away from really crazy random
171:30 - fancy stuff that comes um built in like
171:34 - those templates cause like
171:36 - if you want to add graphics keep it
171:38 - minimalistic generally you won't go
171:39 - wrong with like minimalistic stuff
171:42 - just black screen it's kind of insane
171:45 - but like just a black screen with white
171:47 - text usually works
171:49 - wonders if you want to have that in but
171:51 - like stay away from this because this is
171:53 - like some 19
171:54 - freaking like this video feels like it's
171:57 - like
171:58 - 1970s video actually maybe there weren't
172:01 - computers back then but like
172:02 - it feels like one of those older ones
172:04 - anaconda
172:06 - first go up here and launch your um
172:11 - web browser and just type in anaconda
172:17 - python
172:21 - go to the individual edition anaconda
172:25 - if you click on download you're you're
172:27 - very well spoken so that's really good
172:28 - take you to the bottom of the page i
172:30 - like that it's kind of it's in 60 frame
172:32 - rates per second so it looks pretty
172:34 - smooth and creamy you can click and
172:37 - the installer already downloaded it
172:44 - mike reduced the gain so it's
172:48 - um so it's the audio just keep the mic
172:51 - up close so the audio is clear
172:58 - i would definitely edit out these parts
173:00 - man like you're it's just kind of like
173:01 - you're scrolling around
173:02 - and like
173:08 - installing it to your home directory so
173:09 - it seems like at 2 47 right you kind of
173:12 - stopped speaking
173:14 - i think that's where i had done a um a
173:16 - mess up so i had cut
173:18 - it out and re recorded that piece
173:21 - so you have to cut that part out i gotta
173:23 - cut out a little bit more yes
173:26 - so like notice it's three minutes in
173:30 - three two three three e4
173:36 - now this is gonna so like literally for
173:39 - 40 or 50 seconds
173:40 - you're not saying anything so that's a
173:43 - big problem
173:44 - i gotta go i gotta edit it a little bit
173:46 - more i'm sure
173:47 - yes yes so if you're not gonna have if
173:50 - you're not gonna bring your a game and
173:52 - just come in with [ __ ]
173:53 - great energy then start cutting
173:56 - like i want you to think about yourself
173:58 - like that crazy [ __ ] chef
173:59 - that has like that cuts those onions
174:02 - into thousands of pieces
174:04 - like then that's the type of chef i want
174:06 - you to be like go in that [ __ ]
174:07 - cutting lab and start cutting it up and
174:09 - put it
174:10 - if you're not gonna put in work while
174:12 - you're supposed to be working
174:13 - then put a lot of work in editing like a
174:16 - lot of work
174:17 - so this is how i say if you're gonna
174:19 - just over deliver and commit and just
174:21 - bring your crazy energy
174:23 - that video is gonna be by default so
174:25 - good
174:26 - you're gonna not need to edit it too
174:27 - much if you're gonna hold it back and
174:30 - keep it more reserved in the tank get
174:32 - ready to edit like [ __ ] crazy but
174:33 - that's okay
174:34 - because it is a good skill to pick up
174:36 - [Music]
174:38 - so bro i think
174:43 - honestly your first video you were
174:45 - really on the right track
174:46 - like your intro looks good [ __ ] looks
174:49 - modern you're using slides the design
174:51 - looks clean and minimalistic
174:53 - i mean even though you're tiny you're
174:54 - still there
174:56 - um the second video i feel like got much
175:00 - worse in terms of like the prep
175:03 - like the design of it and stuff like
175:05 - that so i would go more the route of
175:06 - your first one
175:08 - uh and on the title probably not
175:11 - anaconda install
175:12 - like i would probably pick a title
175:14 - that's more popular
175:16 - so along the lines of how to install
175:18 - anaconda or something like that
175:22 - gotcha cool yep okay other than that
175:26 - with this technical stuff as long as you
175:27 - keep making content you're going to win
175:31 - thank you okay great job love it
175:35 - all right awesome so everybody give it
175:37 - up for zach thank you for coming on
175:38 - brother appreciate it
175:42 - awesome let's see who is going to go
175:46 - next so let's go garveet i'll go with
175:48 - you
175:49 - and uh what type of roast are you
175:51 - looking for
175:54 - hey guys my name is garwith mothwani and
175:56 - i welcome
175:59 - what is happening
176:03 - hey gravit are you there
176:08 - he's not there um okay so
176:12 - that's definitely not what i want to
176:14 - start a html for beginners tutorial from
176:18 - hey guys my name is mothwani and i
176:20 - welcome you to
176:21 - don't do this the first few seconds are
176:24 - really important so
176:25 - if you're going to use a slideshow at
176:26 - least put an image
176:29 - room and i'm starting this new series
176:33 - at least should have had the html in the
176:35 - store for hyper text markup language
176:37 - something called tag the closing title
176:42 - see you in the next lecture all right so
176:44 - great
176:45 - you're teaching them something that's
176:47 - good i like it
176:48 - your thumbnail is actually pretty good
176:51 - um
176:53 - yeah i would try to make like not one
176:56 - minute long videos i try to make them
176:57 - more valuable like if it was a 30 minute
176:59 - video and you actually
177:00 - trained something then that's great and
177:03 - if you can
177:04 - what i'd recommend is making like 15
177:07 - like tutorial go all the way until
177:09 - tutorial number 15 or
177:10 - tutorial number 23 and then finally just
177:13 - do a compilation of all the tutorials
177:15 - that one video is going to outperform
177:17 - all of these like 23 videos
177:20 - the compilations do the best
177:24 - we should compile my python tutorial my
177:26 - old one
177:29 - yeah it's great it's actually phenomenal
177:32 - so we should compile that one awesome
177:36 - cool all right we went with victor
177:41 - we went with zach we went with garveet
177:45 - who else we went with kelvin
177:51 - all righty all right all right all right
177:57 - samir samir wanna did i miss anybody
178:02 - it's a mirror all right samir are you on
178:04 - here
178:06 - yes uh can we spotlight him please
178:10 - oh there we go samir i see you okay
178:12 - let's spawn light in please and let's go
178:15 - all right so let's go here
178:19 - one thing i'd recommend i like the route
178:21 - you're going i get it flexbox froggy
178:24 - uh we've done these two but probably
178:26 - like
178:31 - maybe put something coding related or
178:33 - css related in the thumbnail
178:35 - because we tried just going the frog
178:38 - route and it
178:38 - generally is not a good idea because it
178:40 - doesn't get that many views
178:41 - um on it so okay but let's go okay
178:46 - what's up yeah but that's really good
178:50 - that's one hour long so maybe you have
178:51 - some value in here learn css
178:54 - properties by playing flexbox froggie
178:56 - okay
178:58 - what i did is i played the whole 24
179:00 - levels
179:01 - and all together i compiled that video
179:04 - yeah that's what i did too
179:05 - um okay
179:09 - so today we are going to talk about so
179:12 - definitely in the start
179:13 - not the time to don't do that in the
179:16 - start do that before the video starts
179:19 - okay and take that welcome stuff out too

183:15 - so projection is gonna be important
183:17 - right now we can't practice projection i
183:18 - would love to practice it with you
183:20 - but projection is an important part of
183:21 - the game your voice is a
183:24 - [ __ ] gift if you learn to use it the
183:27 - right way
183:28 - it makes people pay attention to you it
183:30 - makes people listen to you
183:31 - you stand out from the group of friends
183:34 - when you meet a potential employer
183:36 - they remember you over so many other
183:38 - people there's a there's
183:40 - a lot of power to it so learn to develop
183:43 - and use it the right way

184:05 - i'm like
184:07 - torn between words and i'm confused so

184:11 - you gotta comment [ __ ] 100 like
184:13 - you're just going at it
184:15 - and second just projection smile
184:18 - camera use your range of emotions
184:22 - really really helpful again

186:04 - part for me to see how you're taking

186:06 - so last time i told misha hey
186:10 - put thumbnails here put text somewhere
186:13 - he's doing
186:14 - that he's got the text here he's got the
186:16 - images now here
186:18 - if uh before it was like too crazy you
186:21 - also removed hyper developer great job
186:23 - again you don't need it bro you can get
186:26 - rid of it it's not gonna [ __ ] change
186:27 - the
186:28 - world it's not super important to brand
186:30 - yourself your brand is your content
186:33 - so remove this stuff this watermarking
186:36 - stuff there's no need for it
186:39 - okay other than that let's see download
186:41 - instagram videos for
186:42 - free cool so let's so i think this is
186:45 - this is pretty good try to not put
186:49 - so much text on your thumbnail like your
186:52 - thumbnail isn't supposed to be exactly
186:54 - your title
186:55 - so try to look at thumbnails that are
186:57 - cleaner
186:58 - that are similar to what you're trying
187:00 - to get across okay
187:02 - so go with cleaner thumbnails with less
187:04 - text
187:06 - okay what's up guys your boy michael
187:09 - from happening
187:10 - i love your intros your personality is
187:12 - really great i look i like how you just
187:14 - look at the camera and talk you got the
187:15 - little music going today i'm going to
187:17 - show you
187:17 - how to download a high quality great job
187:20 - that something came up nice
187:24 - good if you stick to the end of this
187:25 - video to show you how to download this
187:28 - and if you stick to the end of this
187:30 - video holy [ __ ] what what just happened
187:32 - there on instagram
187:34 - and if you stick to the end of this
187:35 - video that's
187:37 - that's weird you don't i don't you don't
187:39 - need to do that you cut somewhere you
187:41 - can just do a hard cut
187:42 - the hard cut will actually look better
187:44 - than adding a transition
187:46 - that fades to black and then it see what
187:48 - i'm saying misha
187:49 - so just do a hard cut between those how
187:52 - to download
187:52 - a very high desktop
187:56 - the url and then audio quality i would
187:59 - try to
188:01 - if you come to this website this is what
188:03 - is going to
188:04 - something funny is happening with the
188:05 - audio so i would
188:07 - nip that in the butt i would try to work
188:08 - on improving that audio quality
188:10 - what what what it looks like then
188:14 - it can download video
188:18 - but other than that i like that you're
188:19 - providing actual value to people
188:22 - that's great okay
188:26 - in this video i will show you how to
188:28 - download facebook videos and live
188:29 - streams into your mac
188:31 - or pc like here your audio could be
188:34 - better but it's not too bad
188:39 - come and click here that audio sounds
188:41 - better
188:45 - then copy the link this
188:48 - actually might be your best video so far
188:50 - bro
188:52 - you got the music in the back but it's
188:55 - so
188:55 - quiet like i can feel it but it's quiet
188:58 - i love that
189:00 - your audio what you want to do is you
189:01 - want to go in your editing software and
189:04 - increase your audio by by six decibels
189:06 - or 10 decibels like you want to
189:08 - ramp it up does that make sense yeah
189:12 - if you are in this website it will give
189:16 - you two of
189:17 - you can be able to add this it has it
189:23 - cut a lot of the silences out if you can
189:26 - yeah
189:27 - okay hi and if you can speak in and keep
189:30 - energy high keep energy high really
189:33 - really important i can't stress that
189:35 - enough
189:35 - for almost all of you guys keep your
189:38 - energy high guys
189:39 - it's a skill that you can train yourself
189:42 - in it's
189:42 - really trainable if you go back to my
189:44 - older videos my energy is really low
189:47 - as you get later later into the videos
189:48 - my energy is high it's a skill
189:51 - develop it keep your energy high all the
189:54 - good speakers that you guys look up to
189:56 - or hear they have a high energy and they
189:59 - can hold that for a longer period of
190:00 - time
190:01 - so i want you to practice that that
190:04 - means
190:05 - using your voice to project louder that
190:07 - means like
190:08 - keeping your body involved in what
190:10 - you're doing you know what you're saying
190:11 - because otherwise you'll lose my
190:13 - interest as i'm going through this
190:14 - tutorial
190:18 - set it to this website
190:21 - and if you want to say stuff to me feel
190:23 - free to also look at the camera and talk
190:25 - because that means like
190:26 - oh now you're talking to me that's cool
190:28 - you can enjoy it
190:30 - these are the two best websites i can
190:32 - suggest you to download
190:33 - i love i love your intros and outros are
190:35 - really good facebook videos
190:37 - if you find it helpful please smash the
190:39 - like button
190:40 - and subscribe thank you for watching see
190:42 - you
190:43 - in the next video hey
190:47 - dude really clean i like the music too
190:51 - nice work brother so what about the
190:54 - titles and stuff
190:56 - uh i think the title is cool like i
190:59 - don't know
190:59 - are is there a lot of like people
191:01 - looking this up
191:02 - download instagram video
191:06 - let's let's type that in let's see what
191:07 - i get
191:11 - so i would i mean model the people who
191:14 - are winning bro
191:15 - model this
191:18 - model this these are these people are
191:21 - winning so
191:22 - model the winners okay
191:25 - yeah so like if they're right there i
191:28 - mean you should be [ __ ] having the
191:29 - same exact type of thumbnails bro
191:32 - okay so i would model these guys who are
191:35 - like
191:36 - crushing it with that 475 000 views 10
191:38 - months ago i mean
191:39 - geez so go with that and then
191:42 - also for the titles i would keep their
191:44 - titles more
191:45 - however they have them right
191:49 - keep it like this uh and so then because
191:52 - yeah right now there's something about
191:53 - your titles it feels weird like it feels
191:55 - almost like
191:56 - i don't know it feels like a scammy
191:58 - video or like you're trying
191:59 - you're creating spam like there's
192:01 - something about the title or
192:04 - title of your video that makes me feel
192:05 - weird and thumbnail
192:07 - because the thumbnail looks a little
192:08 - cheesy and there's too much text on it
192:10 - like i want to stay away from like if i
192:12 - saw it i would stay away from it i would
192:13 - not click it 100
192:15 - i would click uh i would definitely
192:18 - click probably this one if i was trying
192:19 - to do it
192:20 - um or maybe this one
192:24 - okay um or this one like that's really
192:27 - cool
192:27 - so if you can make it a clean modern
192:32 - less cringy and like you know less so
192:34 - much text on the thumbnail
192:36 - then you're gonna be in the right area
192:38 - and then for your title look at these
192:39 - titles that are winning
192:40 - okay yeah okay thank you all right
