01:19 - guys this who here wants to become a
01:20 - front-end developer in 2022 as we head
01:23 - into this new year raise your hands drop
01:26 - some comments let me know if you want to
01:28 - become a front-end developer as we go
01:30 - into the new year if you weren't a
01:31 - developer before guys let's go to this
01:33 - new year
01:34 - ready to crush it if you're with me on
01:36 - this let me know
01:38 - now here is the state of the world right
01:41 - here's what's been going on minus my
01:43 - beautiful drawings let's see if i can
01:45 - erase them
01:47 - okay they're gone
01:49 - okay so this is web 1.0 this was the the
01:54 - world and how it was before as we knew
01:56 - it okay so for example if you could go
01:58 - on to msn or aol or see the internet
02:01 - explorer or google and just search stuff
02:04 - that's what used to exist back in the
02:05 - day you couldn't really add your own
02:07 - data you couldn't create your own
02:09 - profiles there wasn't much you can do to
02:11 - interact with it was essentially a read
02:13 - only internet does that kind of make
02:15 - sense guys if it does let me know just
02:17 - so i want to make sure we're going on
02:18 - the right page or give me a thumbs up if
02:21 - that makes sense if we're on the same
02:22 - page okay beautiful jacob thank you for
02:24 - that anthony thank you for that
02:26 - so
02:27 - that's kind of how like the world of the
02:30 - internet right had been in the past then
02:33 - came web 2.0
02:35 - so who's who's familiar with web 2.0
02:39 - right instagram who here uses instagram
02:41 - raise your hands hopefully everybody and
02:43 - if you don't watch out that person might
02:45 - be the next serial killer just kidding
02:48 - everybody uses instagram right most
02:49 - people do
02:50 - uh facebook right
02:53 - some people don't or are
02:56 - are going off of it but i guess let me
02:57 - let me get a show of hands who still
02:59 - uses facebook you still use facebook
03:01 - kind of actively
03:02 - oh wow big group of people
03:04 - nice
03:05 - okay uh facebook messenger right all
03:08 - these things are web 2.0 and on web 2.0
03:12 - right like youtube you could create
03:14 - videos you could delete videos you could
03:16 - edit videos you could create posts you
03:18 - could delete posts you could edit posts
03:21 - does that make sense guys kind of how
03:22 - web 2.0 is fundamentally different than
03:25 - web 1.0
03:27 - we're all on the same page with that
03:29 - we understand that so far give me a
03:30 - thumbs up if we do because i see
03:32 - everybody
03:34 - okay beautiful
03:36 - awesome
03:38 - and then now we're heading into web
03:40 - three now this is the thing that's like
03:42 - remember guys when we were going from
03:43 - web 1.0 to web 2.0 it was just as
03:46 - confusing everybody was just as confused
03:48 - and most people didn't understand it
03:50 - until like
03:51 - everybody was on it okay this is kind of
03:54 - what's happening as we head into web 3
03:58 - and things are shifting and technologies
04:00 - are shifting and a lot of us are still
04:01 - not in it right who here is familiar
04:04 - with or has heard of things like nft
04:06 - raise your hands if you've heard of
04:07 - things like nfts
04:09 - wow a lot of people right i see lots of
04:12 - hands going up
04:13 - raise your hands if you have heard of
04:15 - ethereum raise your hands if you ever
04:17 - heard of ethereum tons of hands going up
04:19 - yup
04:21 - so hopefully you guys can spot that's
04:22 - ethereum right there right this is
04:25 - bitcoin right here now let me ask you
04:27 - guys this what's this fox looking thing
04:28 - right there does anybody know
04:31 - you guys uh feel free to let me know in
04:33 - the chat below as well
04:36 - meta mask
04:38 - shiva inu somebody says
04:41 - yeah with shiba inu do you guys know
04:43 - what happened where this one person
04:46 - like invested in shiba inu and came out
04:48 - with 5.7 billion dollars in 400 days
04:52 - would you guys like to come out with 5.7
04:53 - billion dollars in 400 days that would
04:56 - not be a bad work here right
04:58 - uh but this is not shiba inu right this
05:01 - is metamask okay so
05:04 - what's happening with this web 3 world
05:06 - is we're now starting to get a lot of
05:08 - ownership that's verifiable that's why
05:10 - people like um i don't know if you guys
05:12 - saw but jay-z hopefully everybody knows
05:15 - here jay-z but jay-z's profile picture
05:17 - on twitter is what do you guys know
05:19 - what's his profile picture he's using
05:24 - it's an nft right it's a crypto punk
05:27 - yeah it's a crypto punk a ton of big
05:30 - celebrities you know like steph curry is
05:32 - he has board ape yacht club even if you
05:35 - don't know what i'm talking about just
05:36 - know this they have just paid seven
05:39 - hundred thousand dollars for a freaking
05:40 - photo
05:42 - okay and why people do that is for a lot
05:45 - of reasons we're not going to go too
05:46 - much into why nfts are valued at what
05:48 - they're at but the reason why a lot of
05:51 - these people have it is this sense of
05:52 - ownership and now you can have real
05:54 - ownership verifiable that you couldn't
05:57 - have with just web 2.0 and that's where
05:59 - we're headed and a lot of things are
06:00 - very transparent you can see
06:02 - transactions on the blockchain and you
06:04 - can even start hosting data on the
06:07 - blockchain and web 3. so this is the
06:09 - world that we're heading to
06:12 - um other benefits of this are if i'm
06:15 - sending us money usd to some other
06:17 - country i'm being charged crazy fees it
06:20 - takes so many days apparently the bank
06:22 - people sleep on the weekends and the
06:24 - money doesn't get through like what the
06:25 - hell is up with that like it's a bank
06:27 - it's just like send the freaking money
06:29 - right i don't imagine it's some actual
06:31 - physical worker that's traveling that's
06:33 - actually carrying the money right it's
06:35 - probably technologically done so i don't
06:37 - understand why technical technology is
06:38 - sleeping on fridays saturdays and
06:40 - sundays with the crypto world that
06:42 - doesn't happen right with the with that
06:44 - doesn't happen things are happening 24 7
06:47 - almost instantaneously you can move i
06:49 - can send bitcoin from here to philippine
06:52 - or to pakistan or to any country in a
06:54 - matter of seconds people will get it
06:56 - don't have to pay fees for it and then
06:58 - can exchange it for anything they want
07:00 - right so hopefully kind of at a high
07:02 - level you can see some of the benefits
07:05 - of web 3.0 and even as confusing as it
07:09 - is can you guys at least see somewhat
07:11 - why it might be powerful as we're
07:13 - heading into it give me a thumbs up or a
07:15 - head not or something if you kind of see
07:17 - that there might be some potential in
07:19 - here
07:20 - all right we got guesses yes i can see
07:23 - it perfect explanation yep no middlemen
07:25 - right no middleman so i'll cut out a lot
07:28 - of the fees like for example you know
07:31 - who here loves overdraft fees with your
07:33 - bank raise your hands if you love
07:34 - overdraft fees
07:37 - david
07:40 - right with web 3.0 and stuff those
07:42 - concepts don't exist you don't have to
07:44 - pay minimum fees for having less than a
07:47 - certain amount of money so there are a
07:49 - lot of things that are going to start to
07:50 - become a lot more simplified transparent
07:53 - no middlemen and just much nicer okay
07:57 - so tons and tons of potential
07:59 - lots of no
08:01 - all right so let's move forward now
08:02 - before we dive in guys i have to let you
08:05 - know and i want to thank our sponsor
08:08 - you know uh our sponsors third web let's
08:12 - give it up for third web guys because
08:13 - this is huge this would not be possible
08:15 - without third web okay so i just want to
08:17 - give them a moment of appreciation i
08:19 - thank you for third web for sponsoring
08:21 - this event and anything you guys want to
08:24 - learn or build with web 3.0 guys there's
08:27 - this is going to be one of the best
08:28 - platforms to do it with now me
08:31 - i usually rarely ever do things with
08:33 - sponsorships right i want to make sure
08:35 - that it's something that actually can
08:37 - bring value and this is one of the
08:39 - companies that we decided to partner up
08:40 - with because we're like man this is
08:42 - there's a lot of value behind what they
08:44 - offer
08:45 - and uh in the project that we're gonna
08:47 - build we're gonna be using third web all
08:49 - right to actually build it and it makes
08:51 - it so much easier because without them
08:53 - it's so much harder to do what we're
08:55 - gonna do but with their help it's gonna
08:57 - be a lot easier so the goal is that the
08:59 - technologies that they provide and what

12:44 - hundred and twenty thousand hundred
12:46 - twenty five thousand five hundred
12:47 - thousand a year geez 165 thousand we

12:55 - okay i mean it's all good even if you
12:57 - under six figures i mean that's totally
12:58 - cool right you could make 60k 70k and be

13:02 - so there's nothing wrong with that
13:04 - amazing 150k 100k min 100 okay cool

13:10 - yeah doge baby
13:12 - so if you guys learn
13:14 - um these skills you'll you'll have a
13:16 - very value you'll be very valuable in
13:19 - the job marketplace right one of our
13:20 - students thomas just yesterday got a job
13:22 - for a hundred thousand dollars a year
13:24 - and that was his first um
13:26 - he had a big jump and he was making 45
13:29 - 000 before and then he went to making a
13:31 - hundred thousand so everybody's going to
13:32 - be at a different page when you get your
13:34 - first job but this is kind of what the
13:37 - average looks like for the first job so
13:38 - i want to just have your expectations
13:40 - clear all right
13:42 - but if you're above average you're
13:44 - crushing the game you know maybe
13:46 - front-end development and then you know
13:47 - how to do how to build stuff with web
13:49 - 3.0 you could definitely like start off
13:51 - or be looking at a six figure salary
13:53 - does that make sense
13:55 - okay fantastic
13:56 - awesome uh according to indeed.com right
13:59 - if you go right now you'll see that
14:00 - there's ton of developer job openings
14:02 - it's about 20 000. why i share these
14:04 - stats with you guys is because i want
14:07 - you guys to be able to see that when it
14:09 - comes to jobs there's tons of
14:11 - opportunity right people go are
14:13 - developer jobs like coming to an end
14:15 - like will developer jobs run out
14:18 - and um it always
14:21 - you know it's an interesting thing that
14:22 - i see or or people go if i don't have a
14:25 - degree can i get a job as a developer
14:28 - and it's like look at the number of
14:30 - people that need that that graduate with
14:32 - uh
14:33 - relevant degrees it's about 30 to 40 000
14:35 - a year
14:36 - do you guys know how many software
14:38 - developer jobs are open just in u.s
14:40 - every single year
14:41 - you guys want to take a guess so let's
14:43 - say there's 30 to 40 000 graduates
14:45 - coming out of us
14:46 - right
14:47 - how many jobs are available put up put a
14:49 - random number put a random number i want
14:51 - to see do you guys have any idea how
14:53 - many jobs are available 80k 25k 100k
14:58 - there's about 150 000 positions open
15:01 - so tell me this
15:03 - right
15:04 - if there's 30 to 40 000 people with
15:07 - degrees
15:08 - and then there's still a hundred
15:09 - thousand almost more positions open
15:11 - what are they going to do just like
15:13 - not give jobs unless people get degrees
15:16 - or do you think that people without
15:18 - degrees can also get those jobs
15:20 - right so i think it's important to
15:22 - understand that um
15:24 - and and we want to just show you this
15:25 - because there's a huge increase and
15:27 - happening in the market right so the
15:28 - last time we did the challenge there
15:30 - were 19 000 job openings now we're doing
15:32 - the challenge literally three to four
15:34 - weeks later and there's already a 6.8
15:36 - increase in the market and it's up to 21
15:39 - 000 that's just to show you that the
15:40 - demand is increasing so hopefully that
15:42 - makes sense for you guys okay
15:46 - now let's talk about the difference
15:47 - between front end and back end
15:49 - development so i want to talk to you
15:50 - guys about that who here knows the
15:52 - difference between front end and
15:53 - back-end development raise your hands or
15:55 - show me or drop it in the comments okay
15:57 - i see you thea's like kinda
16:00 - okay kinda have people hands-raising all
16:02 - right beautiful let's get into it at a
16:04 - deeper level so back end right
16:07 - is
16:08 - you're requesting data
16:10 - the javascript code blah blah blah and
16:12 - then front end then shows it
16:15 - right it shows you the website
16:17 - the data might be stored here so for
16:19 - example all our instagram posts might be
16:22 - stored up here right in some ugly
16:24 - database and then it sends it to the
16:27 - front
16:28 - front end and it goes hey make it look
16:30 - nice so in the simplest way that's how
16:32 - it's said okay all the information stuff
16:35 - is going to be at the back end all the
16:37 - stuff that looks pretty that you could
16:38 - see that you could play with you could
16:40 - touch that's going to be front end at a
16:42 - very high level okay
16:44 - now
16:45 - you might ask what do i need to know to
16:46 - become a front-end developer in 2022
16:49 - here's something i want to show you just
16:50 - to kind of um well let me ask you this
16:53 - have any of you guys seen something like
16:54 - this before raise your hands if you've
16:56 - ever seen something like this before
16:58 - okay
16:58 - lots of hands going up
17:01 - right
17:01 - uh this is this is not really how it
17:04 - works guys this is not this is not
17:07 - reality you don't need to know a million
17:10 - things these are designed to kind of
17:12 - scare you and make you run away from the
17:14 - world of development but like i don't
17:16 - know what o-o-c-s-s
17:18 - is or s-m-a-c-s like i i don't even
17:21 - think i've heard of any of these
17:22 - honestly like i don't even know what
17:24 - suits css is right
17:26 - you don't need to know these things like
17:28 - i think that if you just know these well
17:31 - right over here what i'm highlighting
17:33 - you can actually get offered a lot of
17:35 - jobs if you know them well like really
17:38 - really well
17:39 - these are the fundamental blocks that
17:41 - build up everything else everything else
17:43 - is just syntactical sugar
17:46 - or a framework to make things nicer okay
17:49 - that's kind of what it is so
17:52 - i want you to worry about all this stuff
17:55 - afterwards and just know that a mastery
17:58 - of a few things is what you really need
18:01 - all right now i'm going to simplify the
18:02 - process for you and figure out what's
18:04 - the end goal
18:05 - the end goal is get a job as a front-end
18:08 - developer does that make sense
18:12 - now because you know the reason why i
18:14 - said i know it sounds obvious but the
18:15 - reason why i say this is some people
18:17 - just get stuck
18:18 - in like learning every single technology
18:21 - ever
18:22 - and you guys might know the people that
18:23 - i'm talking about and you might even be
18:25 - one of those people you just want to
18:26 - learn like every framework every
18:28 - possible thing that might be out there
18:30 - when
18:31 - we forget the goal which is
18:33 - learn the skills so we can get a job and
18:36 - then have as much fun as you want do
18:37 - whatever you want i mean nothing wrong
18:39 - with having fun along the way but i
18:41 - think we want to get to our destination
18:43 - as fast as possible
18:45 - okay beautiful
18:46 - so
18:47 - um right now right there's tons of job
18:49 - opportunities available for everybody to
18:51 - be able to apply and go for these jobs
18:54 - right like for example here's an
18:56 - entry-level react js developer job so if
18:58 - you have uh if you're an intermediate
19:00 - level developer you can build some
19:02 - projects or you could do some basic
19:04 - problem solving
19:05 - you can be looking at being able to get
19:07 - a job like this okay probably if you do
19:11 - uh three months to six months of really
19:13 - solid learning and if you have a good
19:15 - path that you're learning on this is a
19:17 - very possible thing that you can go for
19:19 - if you have um
19:21 - let's say like no experience right now
19:23 - okay it's very possible for you to go
19:25 - after this
19:26 - something like this
19:27 - 115 235 range i would say like a little
19:30 - bit of experience you know probably
19:32 - maybe a year or two of experience could
19:34 - really help
19:35 - or maybe your skills are just so
19:37 - freaking amazing which most of the times
19:39 - is really rare
19:40 - unless you have at least a year or two
19:43 - of experience or working at a job
19:46 - so that's just to kind of give you guys
19:48 - a possible range okay so hopefully that
19:51 - that makes sense
19:52 - now
19:53 - here's what you need to do you need to
19:55 - start coding and then you need to start
19:57 - applying all right so let's dive in
19:59 - let's cover the fundamentals in which
20:00 - you need to know
20:01 - the fundamentals are
20:03 - what what is this here what do i have
20:06 - here hopefully everybody knows these
20:07 - logos just drop it in the chat so i can
20:08 - just see that you know
20:10 - we got html5 we got what else css3 and
20:14 - then we got javascript okay these are
20:16 - the three things that you need to know
20:19 - and
20:20 - html is the skeleton as we like to say
20:23 - css makes everything look nice and
20:25 - javascript adds all the dynamism meaning
20:28 - when you click the button
20:30 - javascript is what makes the magic
20:32 - happen with css
20:34 - this is what makes all the styling
20:36 - happen so if you color your button blue
20:39 - that's css if you make it so when you
20:41 - click the button
20:42 - you know the app makes a sound that's
20:44 - javascript okay and the structure of the
20:47 - page that's going to be html
20:50 - now where can i learn these technologies
20:53 - we have you know um who here is already
20:56 - familiar with like my youtube channel
20:58 - clever programmer raise your hands if
21:00 - you're already familiar with it okay a
21:02 - lot of people are already familiar with
21:03 - it
21:04 - so on my channel
21:06 - these are freely available for you to
21:08 - watch you can master html go through the
21:11 - html course you can master css go to a
21:13 - css course master javascript go through
21:16 - the javascript course okay so we want to
21:18 - make all these available for you guys
21:22 - and
21:23 - javascript just completed its ninth year
21:25 - in a row as the most commonly used
21:28 - programming language so javascript is
21:30 - the number one most programming uh
21:32 - commonly used programming language so
21:34 - i'll be showing you guys how to work
21:35 - with that okay
21:37 - now
21:38 - here's what's next all right and this is
21:40 - a stack overflow survey 58 000 responses
21:43 - from mostly developers and you can see
21:45 - javascript stacks up right there okay
21:48 - now here's what's next
21:50 - you need to then learn a front-end
21:52 - framework all right so once you learn
21:53 - javascript this is what you need to
21:56 - learn next so if you have never gotten
21:58 - this roadmap i would say take notes and
22:00 - write this down so you have a roadmap of
22:02 - what you need to do
22:04 - so make sure you learn react because i
22:06 - think this is the best um
22:08 - it's a library i understand a lot of you
22:11 - are gonna start freaking out causey this
22:13 - is
22:14 - this is a library it is not frame break
22:18 - you up quite wrong
22:19 - and it's like
22:22 - jeez i didn't know i had the freaking
22:24 - police on here but um you know this is
22:27 - it's a library it's fine okay so learn
22:30 - something like react you could also
22:32 - learn something like angular i wouldn't
22:34 - say learn both of them just pick one and
22:36 - choose
22:37 - you could also learn something like view
22:40 - okay this is also fine
22:43 - uh svelt is a framework
22:46 - amber is a framework alpine gs is a
22:48 - framework and here's what a framework
22:49 - means
22:51 - it just makes like for example react
22:53 - just makes writing code a lot easier
22:56 - there's other benefits of course
22:58 - underlying technology and how it works
23:00 - but it will make your life a lot easier
23:01 - when you're building components building
23:04 - things to do with your website
23:08 - and according to stack overflow uh
23:10 - react.js is now officially the most
23:12 - popular web framework slash library
23:14 - surpassing jquery okay so it's a good
23:16 - time to consider using react moving
23:19 - forward okay here you can see the stats
23:22 - based on 49 000 responses
23:26 - so
23:27 - you know here's what are all the things
23:28 - that are built with react you have
23:30 - facebook airbnb
23:31 - you know you got instagram you got skype
23:35 - netflix
23:36 - dropbox
23:37 - twitter list goes on and a lot of these
23:40 - companies are using react and the
23:42 - company that invented react and
23:44 - javascript or not javascript but react
23:46 - was facebook okay facebook and
23:49 - invented react for themselves and then
23:51 - they kind of open sourced it and allowed
23:54 - everybody else to use it
23:56 - so
23:57 - here are the next here's the steps after
23:59 - that for you
24:00 - after you're done learning a framework
24:02 - the next thing you need to do
24:04 - is
24:05 - learn a css pre processor okay framework
24:09 - so for example you can learn tailwind
24:12 - css which can make writing your css a
24:15 - little bit easier for you
24:16 - you could learn bootstrap
24:18 - essentially the same goal
24:21 - sas
24:22 - style components material ui any of
24:25 - those things let me ask you guys have
24:26 - any of you guys had um who here well
24:29 - like just start with this who here has
24:31 - played with css or done something with
24:33 - css raise your hands or drop it in the
24:34 - comments
24:36 - a lot of you have done something with
24:38 - css before
24:39 - who here has done something with
24:40 - bootstrap before raise your hands
24:43 - or let me know okay bunch of people
24:45 - playing with the bootstrap who here has
24:47 - played with tailwind
24:50 - tailwind
24:52 - okay some people tailwind but a lot of
24:53 - hands are starting to go down okay
24:56 - okay
24:57 - bootstrap and tailwind yep so these
24:59 - these um frameworks just my pilots here
25:02 - but if you know
25:03 - so these things just make your lives
25:05 - easier okay that's the purpose of them
25:09 - the next thing i think that you should
25:10 - learn is git version control and what
25:13 - this does is allows you to be able to
25:15 - use a time machine as i like to say okay
25:18 - go back and forth in your code base if
25:21 - you delete something by mistake you
25:22 - could go back in time if your project
25:24 - breaks you could go back and forth in
25:25 - time
25:26 - git is very important i think everybody
25:29 - needs to learn it without it you can't
25:31 - really work on a team as a software
25:33 - developer okay so
25:36 - yeah if you build a functionality for an
25:38 - app like user authentication let's say
25:41 - and then
25:43 - you know you go and after that you build
25:45 - a feature in the app like a to-do list
25:47 - feature
25:48 - now if your app breaks and the whole app
25:50 - just stops working you go when do i
25:52 - remember the app last working and you go
25:54 - oh when i built the user authentication
25:56 - feature so you could actually time
25:57 - travel your app back to when you built
26:00 - it
26:01 - okay so you could actually go from point
26:02 - b
26:03 - to point a
26:04 - and you could go from point a to point b
26:06 - so
26:07 - it's really nice that's kind of like in
26:09 - a video game where you could save
26:10 - checkpoints and then you can go to load
26:12 - whichever checkpoint you were last at
26:15 - um
26:17 - okay
26:18 - these two logos that i have here in
26:20 - front of me who knows what these are
26:22 - called
26:25 - which one is this one on the left
26:29 - okay which one is the one on the right
26:34 - okay so a lot of so this is where a lot
26:36 - of people end up getting confused
26:38 - let me ask you this question and answer
26:40 - as fast as you can
26:41 - um or get up and get the same thing
26:48 - oh damn nobody said yes
26:51 - wow nobody fell for it okay great yes
26:54 - good job
26:55 - trick question okay so they're not the
26:58 - same thing they're two different things
26:59 - git is version control it allows you to
27:01 - save your code go back and forth
27:04 - time machine for your code this is git
27:06 - not git lab this is git okay
27:09 - this over here github
27:12 - uh this is essentially dropbox
27:15 - for your code okay this is essentially
27:18 - where you store your code
27:20 - okay cool
27:23 - yep
27:24 - now we're gonna take a glimpse into web
27:26 - 3.0 and the blockchain okay you guys
27:30 - excited about this part because you guys
27:31 - some of you might have heard me talk
27:33 - about the front end part
27:34 - you guys might not have heard me talk
27:36 - about this so now we're getting into
27:38 - some brand new exciting territory
27:40 - yeah let's go angel let's go
27:43 - okay beautiful so let's kind of talk
27:45 - about this now
27:46 - so who knows what these are
27:48 - that just popped up on the screen
27:50 - there's a lot of crazy stuff that popped
27:52 - up on the screen what am i looking at
27:54 - name me some of them
27:56 - somebody says nft somebody says meta
27:58 - crypto bitcoin
28:00 - bitcoin nft's cryptos
28:03 - metaverse okay
28:05 - awesome eth
28:06 - the future
28:08 - okay so i'm going to circle and name
28:10 - them so what is this one what's this
28:12 - here
28:14 - what is this project called
28:16 - man i need you guys to start looking
28:18 - into some nft world because there's a
28:19 - lot going on there and i know we're
28:21 - going to talk about web development but
28:23 - i just can't not share this with you
28:25 - guys because it's my duty
28:28 - um
28:28 - guys seriously look into nft stuff
28:30 - because um
28:31 - we're gonna have a lot of millionaires
28:33 - coming out just from the nft space and
28:35 - it's also really risky so just be
28:37 - careful because i don't want you guys to
28:38 - lose your money so just drop something
28:40 - you're not afraid to lose
28:42 - and uh and and look into that space okay
28:44 - and whatever i said it's not gonna be
28:46 - financial advice
28:48 - um with nfts i don't know what the heck
28:49 - i'm talking about i'm just a dude with a
28:51 - microphone and on you youtube and zoom
28:53 - so
28:54 - uh disclaimer right there okay
28:58 - so this over here is the crypto punk
29:00 - project okay hopefully yep yep ton of
29:02 - you guys are saying that uh this is the
29:04 - project where this image right here how
29:06 - much does it cost who knows if you
29:08 - wanted to buy this image right here how
29:09 - much would it be kevin owens how much is
29:12 - this image my friend
29:19 - yeah so i can't hear you but
29:22 - um
29:23 - it is really expensive
29:25 - it is uh
29:27 - maybe maybe even a few million or like
29:29 - 800 000 or something like that
29:32 - um
29:33 - yep what about this right here that i'm
29:35 - i'm highlighting
29:37 - what is this
29:38 - yup this is solana okay so
29:41 - i'm going to just touch on some of this
29:43 - this is not important this is not going
29:45 - to be necessary for the project we're
29:46 - going to build this is just some extra
29:49 - information that i want to share with
29:50 - you guys because i think it's important
29:52 - um well actually let me just ask you
29:54 - guys this is it okay if i shared some of
29:56 - this extra information or you want me to
29:57 - just skip past this and keep going you
29:59 - guys give me the thumbs up
30:00 - is it okay if i share this
30:03 - okay okay awesome awesome awesome yeah
30:06 - cause sometimes i can go on tangents so
30:07 - i want to make sure that i don't go on
30:08 - on the tangents
30:10 - uh solana guys it's the sickest freaking
30:14 - um
30:15 - chain i think when it comes to uh
30:18 - the blockchain world it's the fastest
30:21 - gas fees are low as heck
30:23 - i think it's going to be the future
30:25 - um i think it's going to be even better
30:26 - than ether 2.0 which is going to launch
30:28 - mid 2022 so i would keep your eyes
30:31 - peeled for solana and projects on solana
30:33 - just because there's the gas fuse are
30:35 - low this over here is ethereum
30:39 - um
30:41 - yeah i because of the gas fees i'm not a
30:43 - huge fan but you know of course all the
30:45 - best projects are on here right this is
30:47 - uh this is windows i think
30:50 - and this is like apple i'm kidding i
30:52 - gonna get so much hate because i know a
30:53 - lot of you are on windows so just i was
30:55 - joking okay i love you
30:57 - um all right
30:59 - over here we got bitcoin this is board
31:02 - ape yacht project or whatever this is v
31:04 - friends
31:05 - and does anybody know which this one is
31:07 - by the way this project here
31:11 - this whole thing just becomes about uh
31:14 - this whole thing just becomes about nfts
31:16 - huh
31:18 - yeah neo tokyo this project was launched
31:20 - by alex becker so neo tokyo huge project
31:24 - v friends i'm depressed that i missed it
31:26 - okay and what's this logo right here
31:29 - this is very relevant for all developers
31:31 - and everybody what's this logo right
31:32 - here
31:33 - yes meta
31:35 - right meta and what's meta
31:38 - formerly known as
31:41 - facebook yes
31:43 - so
31:45 - heading into the meta world which is the
31:46 - web 3.0 you if facebook has changed
31:49 - their entire company's freaking name to
31:51 - meta
31:53 - what do you guys think is going to be
31:54 - happening
31:55 - do you guys think the developers are
31:57 - going to be staying in the web 2.0 stage
31:59 - or you guys think there's going to be a
32:00 - huge movement of web 3.0 coming
32:03 - soon
32:06 - massive movement
32:07 - massive opportunity i think if
32:09 - developers jump on it now you will get
32:11 - so much ahead of everybody else because
32:14 - everybody else will essentially be in
32:16 - the dinosaur stage
32:18 - um
32:18 - and i feel like you're going to be so
32:20 - much ahead of the curve if you jump into
32:22 - this space so whether you jump into it
32:24 - with meta
32:26 - and metaverse and create stuff in the
32:28 - metaverse okay or you jump into it in
32:31 - creating stuff on ethereum or
32:34 - creating your own nfts okay so these
32:37 - nfts guys that started here
32:39 - right somebody bought this nft for ten
32:41 - dollars
32:43 - and now it's like few million
32:45 - all right these projects here have
32:46 - exploded in value
32:49 - and guess what
32:50 - in this project guess what we're going
32:52 - to be having you build
32:56 - your very own nfts
32:59 - all right so you'll get to learn how you
33:01 - can launch your own nfts
33:03 - do your own drops
33:05 - and you know what
33:07 - one of you might kill it
33:09 - one of you might actually drop art that
33:11 - gets traction that might kill it okay
33:13 - that's possible who knows because that's
33:15 - how these projects take off so we might
33:17 - have some huge winner that comes out of
33:19 - this community and would it be cool if
33:22 - it were you would it be cool if you were
33:24 - the founder and creator because like
33:26 - look this is a freaking pixelated jpeg
33:28 - right this is like drawn by hands
33:32 - but like if you were the creator and you
33:35 - had a market cap of like 1 billion with
33:37 - your nfts that might be pretty cool
33:40 - okay so this is where we're kind of
33:43 - headed into this is what i wanted to
33:44 - show you guys at a high level
33:47 - this is the world of web 3.0 okay but
33:51 - this is the most real thing to everybody
33:53 - who's in the web 2.0 world which is
33:56 - facebook so if you know a facebook know
33:58 - that facebook is now heading into web 3
34:00 - along with all this other stuff that's
34:02 - already there so just be on the lookout
34:04 - for it and
34:05 - i hope you guys are excited about it
34:08 - um i would actually get a sense
34:12 - um
34:13 - i want to get a sense if you guys are
34:14 - more excited about it or overwhelmed so
34:16 - either let me know excited or
34:18 - overwhelmed okay overall means you're
34:20 - like either scared or it's so much
34:22 - happening right excited is you're like
34:24 - man there's so much freaking opportunity
34:26 - here and
34:27 - i could see this isaac says both jesus
34:30 - says both alicia's excited zombies are
34:33 - both i'm ready let's go isaiah says
34:36 - yeah brittany so i feel you guys a bunch
34:38 - of it can feel overwhelming like there's
34:40 - a lot going on so i totally understand
34:43 - that okay
34:44 - and um i and i totally understand for
34:46 - those for those of you are excited
34:48 - because i am super excited you know i'm
34:50 - like man i want to learn about this
34:51 - every single day
34:53 - so i would say if you're feeling
34:55 - overwhelmed here's what i did i
34:57 - literally went on youtube watch videos
34:59 - like beginner videos on nfts and just
35:01 - like sit sat back and just learn and it
35:04 - was ton of fun so you might enjoy it and
35:06 - you might learn a bunch of stuff
35:08 - um i think just be open to learning you
35:11 - know and if you can jump into it it
35:12 - could be a huge opportunity for for
35:14 - every one of us that's in this you know
35:16 - on this call here on youtube
35:19 - now what we just
35:21 - talked about was cryptocurrencies nfts
35:24 - the metaverse that's known as web 3.0
35:27 - okay but what is web 3.0 really
35:30 - web 3.0 is decentralization
35:33 - so there's a lot of benefits of web 3.0
35:35 - right let me give you another benefit
35:37 - right here
35:38 - who here has ever put their money into
35:40 - like a savings account or some kind of
35:42 - bond or something where you were getting
35:44 - some interest on it like could be 0.00
35:46 - something percent raise your hands if
35:48 - you've ever put your money anywhere we
35:49 - got like a tiny percentage of interest
35:52 - okay a bunch of people have done that
35:56 - can you guys tell me what a regular bank
35:59 - gives you an interest just like drop it
36:01 - in the chat and tell me what are some
36:03 - percentages that a average bank will
36:05 - give you um point zero zero zero one
36:08 - point zero zero zero one right point
36:10 - zero one point zero zero two
36:13 - so in one year if you put ten thousand
36:16 - dollars how much would you make back
36:21 - or if you put one thousand dollars in
36:22 - one year how much would you make back
36:24 - three cents three dollars
36:26 - right two dollars
36:29 - five dollars if you're lucky
36:32 - in the crypto space
36:34 - you could put your money right now in
36:36 - something like block five
36:38 - right and um again none of this is
36:40 - financial advice so just want to say
36:41 - that but if you put your money in block
36:43 - five
36:44 - uh my friend is earning nine percent
36:46 - interest on that okay
36:49 - fi you like five percent interest are
36:51 - average
36:52 - so
36:53 - just even that opportunity is huge right
36:56 - like there's so much happening that's
36:57 - why a lot of the world is moving there
36:59 - even if you don't know much you could
37:01 - still make like safer
37:03 - sounder investments the only thing is
37:05 - because it's new it's like oh is it like
37:07 - it might be risky so i'll wait but if
37:09 - you wait then you will come to the web 3
37:12 - world when the interest go down to 0.01
37:14 - percent interest right and then and then
37:16 - you're there so you guys see the kind of
37:18 - problem sometimes with waiting
37:21 - right where if you if you risk you can
37:23 - get a higher reward as well right so
37:25 - that's one of the things i would i would
37:27 - say keep in mind
37:29 - um in web you know here are some other
37:32 - fundamental differences right in web 2
37:35 - and web 3.0
37:37 - so web 2
37:39 - the ownership is owned by the network
37:43 - yeah lisa exactly
37:46 - so a lot of the ownership is there's a
37:48 - centralized ownership so for example if
37:51 - um you have a central okay i'll give you
37:54 - an example a bank
37:56 - where you store your money let me ask
37:58 - you is that decentralized or is that
38:00 - centralized i'm just gonna i know i
38:03 - haven't explained it but i just want to
38:04 - throw some examples let me know if you
38:06 - think that's centralized or
38:07 - decentralized
38:09 - yes
38:09 - very good so it's centralized who has
38:13 - the ownership there do you have the
38:15 - ownership or does the bank have the
38:17 - ownership
38:19 - the bank
38:21 - let me ask you this if the bank decided
38:23 - to shut down and tomorrow just go sorry
38:26 - we don't have your money can you really
38:28 - do anything about it
38:32 - there's not much you can do about it
38:33 - they have your money right
38:35 - in the web 3.0 space
38:39 - um
38:40 - you are the owner
38:43 - okay there's no bank
38:45 - so you are the owner
38:47 - meaning that there's no bank that can go
38:49 - down where all of a sudden you could
38:51 - lose all your money
38:53 - the only way
38:54 - it would not work is if like 70 or 80
38:58 - percent of the world decided to stop
39:01 - using the internet or just literally
39:03 - yeah like literally disconnected right
39:04 - and got off the network those are some
39:07 - of the only cases
39:09 - but that's like
39:10 - that's which is more which is more
39:13 - likely to happen a bank shutting down
39:14 - possibly or like 80 of the people just
39:16 - going i will never use the internet ever
39:18 - again
39:21 - right so
39:22 - um
39:23 - most people are gonna be there so this
39:25 - is this is why like you have the
39:27 - ownership you have the rights and you
39:29 - have ultimately actually more security
39:32 - than you do now with your bank
39:35 - okay
39:36 - then in terms of transparency there's a
39:38 - ton of transparency right so for example
39:40 - let's say you want to invest into some
39:42 - charity well when you invest into some
39:44 - charity in in a normal world like web
39:47 - 2.0 world you kind of have to just trust
39:50 - that that charity is going to invest
39:52 - that money in the right way
39:54 - right that's how it works you have to
39:56 - trust them
39:58 - in the web 3.0 world
40:00 - when you invest in if you put money into
40:02 - a charity you'll actually be able to see
40:04 - every single transaction that they make
40:06 - do you do you guys see how that could be
40:07 - beneficial
40:08 - right that that much transparency in the
40:11 - world is huge it's absolutely amazing
40:15 - right imagine if the government is on
40:17 - the blockchain you could see every
40:19 - dollar every tax dollar that they're
40:21 - taking from you you can see exactly
40:22 - where they're spending it wouldn't that
40:24 - be more valuable for a lot of people
40:26 - they'll put their minds at ease at the
40:28 - very least
40:31 - so
40:32 - there's a lot of power to the space that
40:35 - we're heading in right with web 3.0 and
40:37 - there's tons of ownership that's going
40:39 - to be really valuable
40:42 - people are going to start buying
40:43 - properties with this you know soon
40:45 - enough i
40:46 - believe people probably already are
40:51 - and now you might be wondering like how
40:53 - do i build on web 3.0 in the blockchain
40:55 - you guys want to learn how to build on
40:56 - here
40:57 - because like we're excited we're like
40:59 - this is the future this is amazing but
41:01 - it's like
41:03 - how do we actually build on here right
41:05 - because what's cool is you
41:07 - here's what's cool for you guys you guys
41:08 - are not just going to be the consumers
41:10 - of the space right you guys are going to
41:12 - be the creators of the space you guys
41:15 - are going to actually be building web
41:17 - 3.0 like
41:18 - that's what's crazy it's like
41:21 - they're high think about like you guys
41:23 - are going to be building the highways
41:25 - right so
41:27 - that's what's exciting about it
41:29 - um so
41:31 - here's how
41:33 - you normally do it okay you learn things
41:35 - like solidity have anybody ever have any
41:37 - of you guys ever heard of something
41:38 - called solidity
41:41 - nope nope nope okay it's all good some
41:43 - people yeah no no all good
41:45 - solidity is a programming language
41:48 - and it's designed to help you
41:50 - um
41:51 - do stuff with web3 okay it means
41:55 - if you wanted to create your own nft or
41:57 - if you wanted to create your own smart
41:59 - contract or if you wanted to do
42:02 - create your own marketplace you would
42:03 - have to do solidity
42:05 - uh to learn solidity
42:07 - is it's a tough process and it can take
42:09 - you years and it's it's very challenging
42:12 - okay so
42:14 - while this is a fantastic
42:16 - tool an amazing way
42:18 - i would say like right now this is not
42:20 - the way that we're gonna do it
42:23 - okay
42:24 - because we don't have
42:25 - do you guys have like one or two years
42:28 - to spend to do this with me and will you
42:30 - have spent one to two years before we
42:32 - get on the call tomorrow to work on the
42:34 - project
42:35 - okay but what if i could tell you that
42:38 - you don't need to
42:40 - do solidity and spend one to two years
42:42 - what if i could tell you by tomorrow
42:44 - you could actually build an nft
42:48 - and fully understand it and not have to
42:50 - learn and spend years would that be
42:52 - nicer for you
42:57 - yeah
42:58 - okay
42:59 - awesome so that's kind of where i'm
43:01 - getting at okay so again nothing wrong
43:03 - with it this is something definitely you
43:04 - could learn in the longer run but we
43:07 - want to give you guys options that are
43:09 - much easier for you that you can
43:11 - actually access and that's more
43:13 - touchable that's the point of this
43:14 - entire project because i want you to get
43:16 - involved into web 3.0 i want you to
43:19 - learn about it at a high level even if
43:20 - you're a beginner right that's the whole
43:22 - point of this
43:24 - so
43:25 - here we got a solution for you okay and
43:27 - the solution is
43:31 - third web okay we're gonna be using
43:34 - third web and why are we gonna be using
43:35 - third web can you guys tell me this
43:38 - and by the way it's completely free to
43:40 - use okay so
43:41 - doesn't cost you a freaking penny
43:42 - completely free why are we going to be
43:44 - using third web
43:51 - okay
43:53 - everybody tell calls you to drink some
43:55 - water oh yeah thanks i appreciate that i
43:57 - got some water right here
44:01 - yep
44:04 - it's not about the water yeah thank you
44:05 - lina yeah people are pretty involved
44:07 - with um my coughing i appreciate that
44:10 - and like defending me in the zoom like
44:12 - that's that's kind of nice
44:14 - i like that
44:16 - yeah
44:17 - so
44:19 - this will allow you to do it in this
44:21 - much simpler way and it essentially
44:22 - provides a sdk or an api
44:25 - to interface with all the complexity of
44:28 - like there's so much complexity in the
44:32 - web 3.0 world that it was scaring me to
44:34 - not jump into it honestly
44:36 - but
44:37 - for me third web made it really exciting
44:39 - because i'm like hey
44:41 - if they're jumping into it and and if we
44:43 - could do it with uh what they're
44:45 - offering because uh when this is how i
44:47 - discovered third web right like i came
44:49 - across them and i was going through it
44:51 - and they were like a build nft you could
44:52 - do this you could do this i'm like yeah
44:54 - maybe
44:56 - then i started actually we started this
44:57 - showed us how we can do it
44:59 - and i got to speak with the cto of this
45:02 - company his name is jake lou
45:04 - amazing guy and he was just giving me a
45:06 - breakdown of
45:08 - how to actually set it up and i was on a
45:10 - call with him and i remembered this i'm
45:12 - like oh it's gonna be like i know he
45:14 - probably thinks and cto by the way is
45:16 - chief technology officer and they're
45:18 - basically like the head of the
45:20 - developers that's what what they do
45:23 - and i was like on this call and i'm like
45:24 - i freaking know that he thinks it's
45:27 - gonna be simple and that he thinks i'm
45:29 - gonna be able to understand it but like
45:30 - i will have no idea but okay let's just
45:32 - speak so we spoke for 30 minutes to an
45:34 - hour
45:36 - and um and before i got started i said
45:39 - how long do you think it will take me to
45:41 - understand this because i'm like i have
45:43 - no idea
45:44 - how any web 3 stuff works i have no idea
45:47 - about nft's work with coding
45:51 - how long would it take me to learn this
45:52 - right
45:54 - and if i wanted to launch my own first
45:56 - project how long would it take and he's
45:58 - like
46:00 - it'll take you like 30 minutes to an
46:01 - hour
46:03 - and i'm like are you serious
46:05 - he's like yeah
46:06 - i'm like how
46:08 - he goes if you do the traditional route
46:10 - and you do it with solidity and you
46:12 - actually build your own thing that could
46:13 - take a while and that's what most people
46:15 - try to do it gets very complex
46:18 - because you're interfacing with the
46:19 - blockchain you're like creating your own
46:21 - smart contracts there's tons of
46:22 - complexity with the meta mask and all
46:24 - this other stuff right payments
46:28 - here
46:29 - they're basically handling all that for
46:31 - you which essentially means they're just
46:32 - giving you like simple set of commands
46:34 - for you to use you just use those and
46:36 - we'll show you what they are tomorrow
46:38 - you just use those
46:40 - and then you just build it so he walked
46:41 - me through it and i'm like are you
46:43 - serious you just need this and this and
46:45 - this and it works and he goes yeah
46:47 - like this is crazy
46:49 - he goes yeah and so i was so hyped i was
46:51 - so excited i was like okay all right i
46:53 - shared it with the team i shared it with
46:55 - david david helped us build this project
46:57 - so by the way guys give a huge shout out
46:59 - and a huge round of applause to david
47:01 - guys right now let's freaking do this
47:03 - thank you david
47:05 - he built an amazing project it's going
47:07 - to be amazing we're going to show it to
47:08 - you guys tomorrow and one more person i
47:10 - also want to acknowledge who actually
47:11 - put together all these slides and made
47:13 - them amazing i want to give a huge shout
47:15 - out guys to amanath who's also here on
47:17 - this call so let's just freaking do that
47:19 - right now amanda you the mvp brother
47:23 - awesome thank you guys for the love we
47:25 - appreciate you
47:26 - okay so
47:28 - going back to this right once i learned
47:30 - that i said okay cool this is
47:33 - nice this is doable i like this let's go
47:35 - through with it so that's what we're
47:37 - going to be doing with you guys does
47:39 - that make sense we're going to be doing
47:40 - it in a way that's much easier to
47:42 - understand and much more doable okay
47:44 - awesome
47:47 - and like i explained earlier
47:50 - right
47:50 - nfts you can build your own marketplaces
47:53 - you guys could launch your own token if
47:55 - you wanted all right and then you could
47:57 - also put your own splits so for example
47:59 - let's say
48:00 - um oh hi ali how are you doing i just
48:03 - saw you nice
48:05 - so for example let's say ally wants to
48:07 - make a project and she goes there's this
48:10 - rapper snoop dogg and snoop dogg wants a
48:14 - sick ass nft project so she builds a
48:16 - project out for him and she goes you
48:19 - know what and then snoop dogg and and
48:21 - ali is like yo we want to keep some of
48:23 - the royalty from each sale we make from
48:25 - this right so
48:27 - what ally can do is go negotiate a deal
48:30 - with snoop and go hey i get two percent
48:32 - for everything that sells using third
48:34 - web she can actually do that and then
48:36 - every single nft that sells
48:39 - guess who's making two percent royalty
48:40 - on it forever
48:43 - oh and let me ask you this too
48:45 - guess what happens
48:46 - if that person who sold that art resells
48:50 - or that art keeps reselling to like
48:52 - eight different owners
48:54 - guess who keeps getting the two percent
48:56 - royalty every single time on it
48:59 - because that's the cool thing about nfts
49:01 - it goes on kind of forever
49:04 - yeah
49:05 - so
49:06 - because that that's another amazing
49:07 - thing right because you can't do that
49:09 - with the regular world once the painting
49:10 - sells now you you kind of lose who the
49:13 - previous owner was
49:14 - but with nfts whoever the like original
49:16 - owner was they just keep getting
49:18 - royalties on that thing like
49:20 - permanently
49:21 - as long as that thing exists because you
49:23 - can track it all the way back to its
49:24 - original owner
49:26 - um okay awesome
49:29 - average blockchain developer by the way
49:31 - guys makes a hundred and nine thousand
49:32 - dollars a year which is significantly
49:35 - more than most other developers so i
49:37 - think that if you learn front-end skills
49:39 - combined with blockchain and web 3.0 you
49:41 - become really valuable in the
49:43 - marketplace that makes sense guys
49:46 - okay
49:47 - awesome
49:48 - yeah pretty crazy huh somebody was like
49:50 - yeah it's crazy yes
49:53 - exactly
49:54 - um
49:56 - yeah syntax great you go uh syntax says
49:59 - learn third web but don't neglect the
50:01 - actual blockchain technology guys learn
50:03 - solidity meta mask and the latest text
50:05 - related to web 3.0 i totally
50:08 - endorse that and i totally am behind
50:10 - that yes
50:11 - this is just to get you guys in the door
50:14 - okay now granted with this you could
50:16 - still build huge projects
50:18 - but this is to get you guys involved
50:20 - with it okay once you're involved with
50:22 - it you could take third web as far as
50:24 - you want or you could go ahead and just
50:27 - start learning solidity and all these
50:28 - things and do it on your own okay
50:32 - awesome and uh the jobs are kind of
50:34 - skyrocketing really really quickly as
50:36 - you can imagine for blockchain there's
50:37 - tons of cryptocurrency people one of the
50:40 - coolest intersections i've found is
50:42 - becoming a front-end developer at a
50:44 - blockchain company they're looking for
50:46 - tons of front-end developers
50:48 - one of our students joshua just got a
50:50 - job at teller making 48 thousand dollars
50:52 - a year as a junior developer his first
50:55 - job ever and he was a bartender
50:57 - previously
50:58 - and uh in just a couple of months he got
51:01 - a job and
51:02 - he's in the crypto space the teller is a
51:05 - is a company that's it's crypto related
51:07 - and he got a job because they were
51:09 - looking for front end developers so it's
51:10 - a really cool mashup of skills it's
51:13 - actually really valuable
51:16 - so if you have any questions uh comment
51:18 - them below um i'm gonna i'm gonna take

59:07 - so
59:08 - so
59:09 - so far we are annoying for the fangs and
59:11 - the fintech so this is the third segment
59:12 - now
59:13 - blockchain type of jobs or is it
59:16 - are both type of jobs uh is the
59:18 - blockchain within
59:20 - the fangs and the fintech
59:24 - um
59:26 - this is um
59:27 - yeah this is blockchain so this could
59:29 - still be part of fintech like there's
59:31 - there's fintech stuff right like for
59:33 - example block fi is fintech
59:36 - um
59:37 - yeah so
59:38 - i wouldn't really compare if this is
59:40 - fintech or not this is more like
59:42 - there are certain jobs that are more
59:45 - you know web developer and then there's
59:46 - certain jobs that are more heavy
59:48 - blockchain and so we're kind of
59:51 - i'm showing you guys the mixture of the
59:52 - two and i think there's a huge market
59:54 - there for you guys

64:38 - amazing community how many other
64:40 - places do you know where this many
64:42 - people who are interested in coding get
64:44 - on a freaking zoom call how many other
64:46 - places do you know like this
64:48 - right so this is like a privilege for
64:51 - all of us to be here including myself so
64:53 - don't take it for granted this is what
64:55 - happens at events people just go oh it's
64:57 - a nice event it feels like it's gonna
64:59 - last forever but it won't this event
65:01 - will be over before you know it the
65:03 - energy that we create here the magic
65:05 - that we create here after these two
65:07 - three days
65:08 - it starts to dissipate so i want you to
65:10 - take advantage of this okay so instead
65:12 - of like if you think about a real event
65:14 - what does everybody do after the event
65:16 - is done everybody just goes back to
65:18 - their hotel rooms or they just leave
65:20 - right but i wanted to make a difference
65:23 - in you for a lifetime so what i'd rather
65:25 - you do is stay after the event talk to
65:27 - the people okay look around
65:30 - make a friend i want you to do this
65:32 - right now guys send two people a direct
65:35 - message right now in zoom chat do it
65:37 - right now
65:38 - direct message okay so you can click
65:40 - where it says everyone you could pick a
65:42 - person look around you pair up with
65:44 - somebody send two people messages hey
65:47 - let's get together and code do that
65:49 - right now let me know once that's done
65:51 - find who you want to message there's
65:53 - four pages of people that are on here
65:55 - you can scroll past
65:57 - okay the people with the videos on
65:59 - they're going to get chosen first
66:00 - because they're going to show up on the
66:01 - first page
66:02 - people with the videos off people are
66:04 - gonna have to look for you or find you
66:09 - for anybody that's messaged at least two
66:11 - people
66:12 - okay
66:13 - about coding or linking up
66:16 - let me know right now in the zoom chat
66:17 - that you've done so okay i want to be
66:20 - here until everybody's connected with
66:21 - each other and working with each other
66:26 - can only message hosts interesting
66:31 - oh i don't know is there a setting david
66:33 - that we could change for direct
66:35 - messaging that's interesting it's weird
66:36 - i don't know why that's the case can i
66:38 - change it
66:39 - um
66:40 - it should be it should be on if it's
66:43 - zoom is it zoom
66:45 - yeah let's see i don't
66:49 - yeah i don't know of a setting that
66:51 - allows that the heck
66:55 - shout out can
66:59 - um
67:02 - david want to look uh look it up maybe
67:04 - because anybody look up how to how to
67:06 - allow that that's weird
67:08 - shouldn't be like a hidden thing
67:12 - well wait which one which one
67:16 - um
67:19 - uh is it interesting
67:20 - that we can
67:22 - because i can direct message anybody
67:24 - right but it seems like everybody on
67:26 - this call can direct message anybody
67:29 - oh
67:33 - right
67:33 - not everybody can direct message anybody
67:36 - so guys while we figure that out here's
67:38 - what i want you to do okay try to just
67:40 - drop it in here right now i know it's
67:42 - gonna go crazy and it's gonna be hard to
67:44 - see but try tagging people and dropping
67:46 - it in here and then what you can do is
67:48 - you could do it on discord as well
67:50 - okay
67:52 - so kevin right joe diaz how are you bud
67:55 - siddharth would you like to connect
67:57 - okay deval says i got you chris taylor
68:00 - la hit me up okay
68:03 - people are dropping their phone number
68:04 - if you're near that area you could text
68:06 - these people so until we figure out how
68:08 - to send direct messages just drop it in
68:10 - here and then i want you to go inside of
68:12 - discord and be able to message each
68:14 - other and pair up okay find somebody you
68:17 - can pair up with find somebody that you
68:20 - can work with
68:21 - okay
68:28 - okay fantastic
68:30 - yeah do it on youtube as well
68:32 - anybody wants to code i have been
68:34 - learning for three months i'll show your
68:36 - comment over here teresa awesome yeah
68:39 - got your comment right here on youtube
68:42 - so if you're on if you're on youtube do
68:45 - the same thing jump into discord partner
68:47 - up with people people are dropping their
68:49 - usernames but i want everybody to have
68:51 - two to three partners for this event so
68:54 - when you come tomorrow you need to have
68:56 - one to two partners sorry not two to
68:58 - three but one to two partners all right
69:01 - one or two partners by the time you come
69:03 - in tomorrow
69:05 - okay that's a must because i need you to
69:08 - be paired up with some but it's going to
69:09 - get hard it's going to get challenging
69:11 - there's going to be a bunch of hurdles
69:13 - that can come in your way but when
69:14 - you're partnering up with somebody it's
69:15 - going to be great and if i make it
69:17 - non-optional meaning if you don't have a
69:19 - partner and you can't prove it we kick
69:22 - you out of the zoom call i know
69:23 - everybody's going to be doing it
69:25 - okay
69:26 - mix is laughing yeah i know everybody's
69:28 - going to be doing it so we're going to
69:29 - make it that's not optional
69:32 - so if you want to jump on the zoom call
69:34 - you know
69:35 - uh you need to have one to two partners
69:38 - if you don't have one to two partners
69:39 - then you're gonna have to just watch it
69:41 - from youtube okay but i think that
69:43 - there's a huge benefit to being a part
69:45 - of this community
69:46 - and uh and being on the zoom
69:52 - okay amazing looks like everybody's
69:53 - starting to hit each other up
