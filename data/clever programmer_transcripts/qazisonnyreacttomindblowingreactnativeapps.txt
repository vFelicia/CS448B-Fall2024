07:11 - to reddit and type in react native and
07:13 - sort by
07:14 - top apps and year here's the url for it
07:17 - although at the top you guys can even go
07:18 - to this url directly if you want
07:21 - and you can use this to get really good
07:24 - ideas for what types of apps to build
07:27 - oh dude check it out middah tahir says i
07:30 - just earned 30 dollars from fiverr
07:32 - from a react project thank you sonny and
07:33 - kazi that's dope dude

07:41 - happy
07:43 - oh i love it there's an app called oh
07:45 - yeah you've got the screen it says let's
07:47 - fork
07:48 - my first real native react native app

07:52 - people decide where to eat that's that's
07:53 - a pretty clever name
07:54 - that's fork yeah that's a really great
07:57 - app by the way
07:59 - it's kind of like tinder oh wow you have
08:02 - a new oh yeah

08:06 - that's cool that's really really cool
08:09 - um almost a year of learning react

08:26 - yeah dude wow i really wish that this
08:30 - app is actually published
08:32 - yeah and you know what this is cool dude
08:34 - because a lot of people watch react
08:36 - native as in like they see tutorials and
08:37 - they're like
08:38 - yeah but if you guarantee it's not going
08:40 - to look that great you know if it's
08:42 - going to compile down to ios and android
08:44 - but guys these apps look beautiful

23:14 - that no don't overdo them with it but as
23:16 - in like if you gave like
23:18 - the user when they go into their
23:19 - settings screen and it kind of flipped
23:21 - out
23:22 - that would be kind of crazy right yeah i

23:45 - with that kind of thing
23:46 - if it goes if you go a bit too mad then
23:48 - they're probably gonna get like a
23:50 - c a seizure or something from that
23:54 - yeah all right guys i'm gonna start
23:56 - blocking people who are spamming the
23:58 - chats

24:25 - clean
24:26 - oh my god that is nice man i don't know
24:28 - why some apps don't
24:29 - don't use that like imagine instagram
24:31 - use this kind of thing so
24:33 - if you go to reddit um i think i'm on
24:36 - number two eight three so
24:38 - on the left is 283 is in the output
24:41 - oh see i mean yeah yeah i know i'm going
24:44 - finding it
24:46 - that's funny
24:52 - it's probably skipped on yours built an
24:55 - instagram clone with react dark mode
25:00 - took seven days to build oh wow
25:04 - look at that green that's been
25:08 - that's probably before two months ago no
25:10 - so instagram had
25:12 - dark mode i mean was it two months ago
25:15 - they had a dark mode was it it was a
25:16 - while before
25:17 - but oh either way that's still that's an
25:19 - awesome project yeah
25:21 - that's an amazing project wow
25:26 - i love apps like this dude their visual
25:28 - timer was react native
25:30 - you're like anything with visual where
25:31 - it's like sort of like
25:33 - kind of help you out or it pings you
25:34 - with a notification or like you know if
25:36 - you're doing pomodoro
25:37 - yeah actually let me see what type of
25:41 - app i would really like to log
25:43 - in come in let's see oh yeah
25:48 - uh maybe income or something
25:54 - uh
26:01 - i mean something simple like that could
26:03 - be pretty really cool actually like
26:05 - this one right here oh yeah that's queen
26:08 - that's clean
26:09 - like hot where are we at with the
26:10 - monthly earnings so far
26:13 - see i would use i would use react js for
26:16 - that
26:16 - yeah that's fine i mean i would i would
26:18 - be happy building that in react by the
26:20 - way
26:20 - completely happy yeah um
26:24 - but you see we could do like a react
26:26 - native app something like this would be
26:28 - cool too
26:29 - like you see the cards with that sort of
26:31 - 3d it's all flat but 3d
26:36 - this one yeah
26:40 - that's gorgeous yeah
26:45 - oh my god this looks so good
26:50 - oh my god that looks so [ __ ] good
26:52 - like
26:53 - imagine here yeah
26:56 - imagine here you have net worth
26:59 - oh that's clean right imagine here you
27:01 - have recent sales
27:04 - that would be nice scheduler could be a
27:07 - very cool sort of
27:09 - like calendar view when you click it pop
27:11 - up your skin like you're kind of for the
27:13 - day
27:14 - yeah oh my god that would be sick
27:16 - imagine over here right
27:18 - so this is pretty cool so imagine this
27:20 - okay
27:21 - all the red days are where you lost
27:23 - money like you were net negative
27:26 - all green days are where you're net
27:28 - positive
27:29 - that's clean man right yeah that's clean
27:33 - now this is a good design dude you
27:35 - should save this on yeah
27:37 - this yeah yeah
27:43 - guys if you're enjoying it smash the
27:44 - thumbs up button and
27:46 - let us know what you would want to build
27:48 - in terms of react native apps
27:54 - all right that is so good
27:58 - wow like this would be amazing
28:03 - so like if we're logging daily income
28:05 - and if it looks something like this
28:07 - oh 10 up or whatever like that's so cool
28:12 - this is like a really modern app that's
28:15 - nice right
28:17 - yeah that's that's really nice that's
28:20 - kind of like the banking app i use right
28:22 - now
28:22 - they you they have a very similar design
28:24 - to that
28:26 - dude we should start posting these apps
28:28 - on our like slack channel that'd be
28:29 - really cool
28:31 - [ __ ] yeah i mean our instagram channel
28:34 - what the [ __ ] did i say yeah channel
28:37 - instead you mean like uh
28:38 - oh my god yeah like ig post like
28:41 - oh my god look at this [ __ ] this
28:44 - looks so
28:46 - amazing that's nice it's so cute it has
28:49 - like a cloud
28:53 - somebody said this is brill oh that's
28:55 - maribel i i was like
28:57 - some british person is here
29:01 - your friends in the chat like
29:04 - dude look at this line graph it it's
29:06 - like [ __ ]
29:08 - 40. that's clean
29:11 - we just got a super chat oh nice
29:15 - thank you rahul thank you
29:18 - appreciate you brother lads
29:25 - all right all right all right
29:27 - visualization that we've really
29:29 - m3js
29:33 - also this would be sick too so like
29:37 - i love seeing bar graphs if i could
29:39 - actually see a bar graph of the daily
29:41 - sales
29:43 - just simple like that would be really
29:45 - really cool
29:47 - yeah yeah i think the first design was
29:51 - was actually really clean man yeah
29:56 - because it was in in a glance you could
29:58 - see everything yeah
30:02 - yeah the first one meaning the one i
30:05 - sent you
30:07 - yeah i mean that's also pretty that also
30:10 - requires a lot of things like that
30:11 - requires like
30:13 - net worth and [ __ ] like that but that
30:16 - would be that would be cool
30:18 - yeah because all of these would just
30:20 - require the income in some form of like
30:23 - you know some kind of import there
30:25 - and then you would pretty much just go
30:27 - ahead and build it into that
30:28 - that kind of look like what i want to do
30:30 - is
30:32 - like for example i think this is like
30:34 - overkill for
30:36 - step one of what we're trying to do for
30:38 - step one we just need a way to log
30:41 - income and see it like literally just
30:43 - income
30:44 - so barbara something like that is b1
30:47 - so like v1 even forget about that purple
30:51 - line
30:53 - just the green line alone is [ __ ]
30:55 - great yeah
30:56 - yeah and some way of visualizing it on
30:59 - the back so like even if i manually just
31:01 - log how much income we made today
31:03 - it just if it makes that graph that's
31:05 - fantastic that's perfect yeah
31:08 - exactly
31:11 - somebody said something i'm a developer
31:13 - like you guys working at
31:14 - volkon web solutions llc nice rahul
31:20 - hey we just broke 200 off
31:23 - [ __ ] my life
31:26 - i hit the chat by mistake yo did you see
31:29 - tesla is looking for react native
31:32 - engineers really yeah
31:35 - it's in reddit four months ago oh i
31:38 - didn't know there was a
31:39 - talent on this sub but my team is
31:41 - looking for engineers
31:42 - and uh that's straight from tesla dude
31:45 - this kind of looks cool
31:47 - the blue graph oh damn
31:51 - they've all got that kind of swipe up
31:53 - you know overlay you could use that
31:54 - library that we saw inside
31:56 - oh yeah they're using that library yeah
32:02 - you see this dashboard where they have
32:04 - this like line graph
32:07 - below ui oh yeah yeah
32:10 - like that for income i mean like the app
32:13 - that we're kind of building seems pretty
32:15 - good to be honest
32:16 - yeah like this is cool this bar graph is
32:19 - really cool
32:20 - yeah getting i mean getting this stuff
32:22 - out there initially like
32:24 - just functioning right yes and then
32:27 - getting this sort of design
32:29 - paint on the ends 93 of the job for me
32:32 - is complete if i can just
32:34 - add my income and see like a
32:37 - like like this here right yeah
32:41 - if i if i can just add my income and i
32:44 - can just see
32:45 - the graph i'm happy exactly
32:49 - somebody so bala ganesh says like
32:51 - firebase github netlife is there any
32:53 - source to host react native app
32:55 - apart from expo i mean i don't really
32:57 - know why you would want to go
32:59 - away from expo um because expo makes
33:02 - your life
33:02 - so much easier um
33:06 - but beyond that you can use something
33:07 - called test flight that's why is pretty
33:09 - cool it's
33:10 - how you test the ios app before it goes
33:12 - into the app store
33:13 - uh we talked about that and when the
33:15 - coaching course actually has awesome uh
33:16 - test flight
33:18 - like i want the app to say some
33:20 - encouraging messages like
33:22 - you guys are doing like you're doing 23
33:24 - better this time than last month like
33:26 - keep going
33:27 - like if you keep if you keep up with
33:29 - this pace of income for the next week
33:31 - you'll beat out
33:32 - your last quarter you know what i mean
33:34 - like yeah
33:36 - things that design behavior change
33:39 - for our team like
33:42 - we'll push like um oh paris is in the
33:45 - chat dude
33:46 - oh [ __ ] what's up paris hey
33:50 - yeah i know what you mean dude like is
33:52 - it it drives habit if literally if
33:54 - you're because every time i have a few
33:55 - apps that just ping me like random stuff
33:57 - like don't be lazy go and do this
33:59 - or like don't be lazy like read this
34:00 - book don't be lazy go get crazy
34:05 - yeah i agree like this is too much like
34:08 - i don't like this design because what
34:09 - the [ __ ] like
34:12 - it's like yeah i feel like it's a bad
34:15 - i feel like i got paid in like usd on
34:18 - this day and like
34:19 - somebody paid me in like [ __ ]
34:21 - pastries on this day
34:23 - yeah cause for a second hey we just got
34:25 - a donation of one dollar thank you so
34:27 - much
34:27 - hey thank you i saw one where it was
34:30 - like the red like it had a red color and
34:31 - i was like oh but then it didn't really
34:33 - make sense because the other one
34:34 - the larger bit was red so yeah
34:37 - just gets like too too much
34:40 - here's another one like income boom
34:43 - income
34:46 - yeah that's clean how much did we make
34:48 - so far this month a total like summation
34:50 - right there
34:51 - this is the one we can follow bro this
34:53 - is the one we can follow
34:54 - yeah that's like pretty simple and we
34:57 - can use that layout
34:58 - yep we're already using the line graph
35:00 - right yeah that's good
35:02 - we just need to be able to log the
35:04 - income right underneath it and then
35:06 - boom the total amount right there and
35:08 - that's
35:09 - that's a good one save that because
35:11 - imagine on the left we've got dashboard
35:13 - pretty much rendering out all of that we
35:14 - already have the grass
35:16 - doing that in react would be pretty it
35:18 - will be easier than react native
35:20 - and then on the right we could have like
35:21 - a live feed of it of the events you know
35:23 - the last three events yes
35:30 - preferences open drop page after upload
35:33 - nope
35:36 - nice
35:41 - say that again sonny what's up i wasn't
35:45 - saying that on the right side that
35:46 - you could have like a list of the last
35:48 - live events you see where it says income
35:50 - spent
35:51 - that's cool by this person sale by that
35:54 - person expense out you know
35:56 - yeah yeah yeah yeah like some live
35:58 - events exactly that would be really cool
36:00 - like
36:01 - frankie closed the sponsorship deal
36:04 - or like sale for this or that okay
36:07 - that's cool
36:08 - exactly that'll be awesome here's
36:10 - another good one
36:13 - simple income um i like
36:16 - that that's pretty clean as well yeah
36:19 - i'm a fan i'm a fan of the
36:20 - the straight simple you know simple
36:23 - graph
36:24 - dude i love [ __ ] like this too where it
36:25 - feels like it's coming
36:27 - off the screen or something like yeah
36:30 - that looks so yummy like i want to eat
36:33 - it
36:33 - like i literally like i want to grab it
36:36 - eat it they got rid of that
36:37 - old style like 3d effect it's it's kind
36:40 - of it's it's like
36:41 - flat but pops out with a shadow that's
36:44 - all they do now
36:45 - really so like this this is like the
36:48 - modern design because it's flat
36:50 - but it just pops out with a shadow
36:51 - that's all it is it's flat with a shadow
36:54 - but oh really old ios update
36:57 - is that what makes it feel like but what
37:00 - makes it feel like it's literally
37:02 - [ __ ] real or something
37:05 - yeah it's that clean like because they
37:08 - used to go
37:09 - like i mean it's like everything goes in
37:11 - and out of trends you know like
37:13 - back in the day ios apps used to kind of
37:15 - all the the app icons used to be like
37:17 - this 3d looking
37:18 - shiny shine to it see that's a bit
37:22 - like as you know that is pretty good for
37:23 - crypto that's pretty handy for crypto
37:28 - i'm just thinking uh
37:31 - hmm this is like maybe
37:35 - the percentages can tell us oh that's
37:38 - cool so like
37:40 - okay for example i would want to know
37:42 - our daily average of sales
37:44 - that's i think important yep
37:47 - um that was top left
37:51 - yeah even if we don't know the net worth
37:52 - i think that would be fine
37:54 - but like even for version one like my
37:57 - average of daily sales yeah would be
38:00 - huge
38:01 - because that's one thing i practically
38:02 - always need to look at or i manually try
38:04 - to calculate it
38:06 - um yeah
38:10 - and then i'm trying to think um
38:13 - so and then like day by day activity is
38:17 - is pretty good i'd say you know like
38:20 - because then you see that bottom right
38:21 - graph
38:22 - if that's like your day by day because
38:24 - that will you from that one
38:25 - visualization you'd be straight away see
38:28 - that okay
38:28 - are we making the same every day or is
38:31 - it kind of up down up down up down
38:33 - or are we going downhill you see how i
38:34 - mean like a bar graph
38:36 - here yeah yeah okay cool
38:39 - yeah and then like a percentage
38:42 - and the only the what percentage
38:45 - basically just means
38:46 - is compared to last month
38:49 - yeah like month to date
38:53 - basically see what i'm saying comparing
38:55 - it to previous period of month to date
38:58 - are we better so it's like in the first
39:00 - 14 days of november are we doing
39:02 - better than first 14 days of october
39:06 - yeah it's in like you what you would
39:08 - have two date pickers and some kind of
39:10 - select
39:10 - like comparison or no not date pickers
39:13 - just a permanent percentage that's there
39:16 - that's
39:16 - always comparing current months to date
39:20 - with
39:20 - previous month to date so if it's
39:22 - november 14th it should just be
39:24 - if we're on november 14th right yeah and
39:27 - looking at our sales
39:28 - there should also be a percentage sign
39:30 - that's telling us like oh you guys are
39:31 - actually out performing last month by
39:33 - seven percent so far
39:36 - yeah that'd be clean
39:39 - i really like the idea of of that and
39:42 - then
39:43 - remember that the the calendar view with
39:45 - the either the green dot or the red dot
39:49 - um oh yeah oh yeah yeah that would be
39:52 - really cool
39:53 - but that one is i think version two
39:55 - because it requires us to log
39:58 - expenses as well yeah
40:01 - that's true yeah but that one i mean
40:03 - that is
40:04 - really really cool
40:10 - damn these react native like look at
40:12 - this like for example if we have
40:14 - something that's telling us how much our
40:16 - profit is
40:18 - over the quarter that would be really
40:20 - cool
40:22 - and for it to look like that type in on
40:25 - dribble let me have a look on dribble
40:26 - um type in
40:30 - like somebody suggested earlier like a
40:32 - graph or something like graph
40:36 - really like you know like graphing kind
40:40 - of apps because you kind of
40:41 - if you swipe through them you kind of
40:43 - get you get like
40:44 - some because they all have like a
40:45 - similar look and feel there's something
40:50 - like this this is pretty sick so okay so
40:53 - let me oh man i can't actually
40:55 - you can link it to me oh yeah that's it
40:58 - okay
40:59 - um oh no um
41:04 - [Music]
41:15 - that one is really cool you see like
41:17 - dark mode would be amazing you see
41:19 - where it says income look at the dark
41:22 - mode of income
41:23 - at the top see that yeah
41:26 - that looks incredible
41:37 - how many girls suddenly laughed at my
41:39 - joke i was kidding
41:41 - was the joke you guys are crowding the
41:42 - youtube server
41:44 - [Laughter]
41:49 - [Music]
41:59 - have you ever noticed you know alexander
42:00 - i think it's alexandros
42:02 - tuition always comments with a plus i've
42:05 - always noticed that i don't know
42:06 - what even when he messages me on
42:09 - instagram he messages with a plus
42:11 - i don't know if he's really consistent
42:12 - with that or what
42:17 - yeah that's crazy man
42:21 - man i kind of just want somebody to
42:23 - build us an app like that
42:27 - take the work oh you know we should do
42:31 - we should actually i'd be happy paying
42:33 - them for it i just
42:34 - would love an app like that where i can
42:36 - log react native [ __ ]
42:38 - sales for the team yeah
42:42 - what were you gonna say sony girlfriend
42:45 - i love how everyone's supposed my name
42:47 - is sony alexandra
42:49 - he said plus consistent plus fire plus
42:53 - alexandra's please give us an
42:55 - explanation dude like
42:57 - so he's actually a monk by the way
43:00 - no way really yeah he told me that
43:03 - because
43:03 - i was reading uh jay shetty's think like
43:06 - a monk and he responded or something and
43:08 - he said
43:08 - i was training to be a monk or something
43:10 - along those lines
43:13 - that's cool that's cool yeah i'm reading
43:15 - that book right now that's
43:16 - it yeah nice man
43:19 - 10x rule for me right now is game
43:21 - changer
43:23 - yeah yeah that looks awesome
43:25 - [Music]
43:30 - holy [ __ ]
43:36 - jacked oh man
43:41 - look at me being a tyrant over here just
43:43 - blocking him
43:47 - and i was like oh [ __ ] oh this
43:50 - is cool as [ __ ] that's pretty cool
43:55 - wow look at that at the bottom you can
43:57 - actually see your run
43:59 - mapped out
44:04 - that gave me an idea imagine we had a
44:06 - way of because when we track a sale
44:09 - um for one of the products like we have
44:11 - we know who it comes from right
44:13 - so imagine if we had bar graphs and then
44:16 - each bar graph had a picture of the
44:17 - person on top
44:18 - oh that would be so cool how cool would
44:21 - that be because i mean as soon as you go
44:22 - into
44:22 - the dashboard you'd see like and they
44:25 - can
44:26 - pull the picture from one of their
44:27 - social profiles like for example if they
44:29 - give you their email
44:30 - then you can actually pull a picture
44:32 - from either their facebook or something
44:33 - like that too
44:34 - yeah yeah that would be really freaking
44:38 - cool
44:40 - because any kind of competition i think
44:42 - if you can introduce into and out
44:44 - like you know if you you're competing um
44:47 - that always helps out i think yeah like
44:50 - this
44:51 - is what i i want bro like [ __ ] where we
44:54 - can just see the [ __ ] sails
44:56 - and see him in a beautiful way across
44:59 - the team and we can log in and we can go
45:01 - oh that's how we did right now this is
45:03 - how we're doing this quarter
45:04 - ah okay cool just simple graphs
45:07 - i don't know why things don't come out
45:09 - of the box like that
45:12 - new season said seeing these apps
45:14 - inspires me more and more i'm currently
45:17 - in the only language i know is java
45:18 - because that's what my college requires
45:20 - used to learn i really want to learn css
45:22 - html javascript i can vouch for you dude
45:24 - because
45:25 - i came out of uh college university with
45:28 - java only
45:29 - and i switched to javascript and
45:33 - when at uni or like college they're only
45:35 - gonna they're gonna
45:36 - they kind of laugh at javascript dude
45:38 - but like yeah like don't
45:40 - like take it lightly like i think
45:41 - javascript is so powerful now so
45:43 - i would literally go ahead and watch our
45:45 - videos and and you catch up and
45:48 - learn some reacting yeah you can get
