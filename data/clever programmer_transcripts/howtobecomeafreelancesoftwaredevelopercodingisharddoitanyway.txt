00:01 - [Music]
00:03 - just wanted to say things are hard good
00:06 - do them anyway like today I didn't feel
00:11 - like going to the gym this man did not
00:15 - look at his face look at his face that
00:18 - does not look like a face that wants to
00:19 - go to the gym he did not want to go to
00:22 - the gym yep and we both went anyway
00:28 - coding is hard
00:30 - coding is difficult there will be days
00:32 - where you don't want to do do it at all
00:36 - you're gonna get opportunities whether
00:38 - it's in freelancing or you're applying
00:39 - to platforms like wise and take lessons
00:42 - or upward this is a student from clever
00:46 - programmer yengee zhang and she actually
00:49 - made this comment two years ago which
00:51 - was super cool and she said I followed
00:53 - your tutoring others idea went on to
00:56 - wise ant and landed my first session in
01:00 - under 72 hours so this is actually that
01:04 - possible you could do this right away
01:06 - and make it work it can take as little
01:10 - as 72 hours it might not happen for you
01:12 - but you could give it a try or code
01:14 - mentor or whatever it is in your country
01:16 - you know always here it doesn't work in
01:18 - my country doesn't matter all right you
01:21 - need there's some equivalent in your
01:24 - country that works so just look it up
01:25 - like it's called Google so just use it
01:28 - ah that now that I got out is there
01:31 - still gonna be somebody in the Commerce
01:32 - is gonna be like wait it isn't working
01:35 - in my country well yes I at this point I
01:37 - can't help you
01:39 - okay what that said yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:43 - seriously move in that case if there
01:45 - isn't even an equivalent then just move
01:47 - that's probably the best if there is no
01:48 - freelancing opportunity in your country
01:51 - that probably is representative of how
01:53 - much opportunity in generals in my
01:55 - country so you should probably move yep
01:59 - that's that's the best advice we can
02:03 - give you like then then start watching
02:05 - Gary B's content and like flipping trash
02:15 - and turning it from $2 in to $50 or $100
02:19 - and I love Gary Vee by the way
02:21 - coating content you're not gonna put out
02:23 - anything that day I'd rather you just
02:25 - film yourself drinking a cup of coffee
02:27 - and maybe talking about the story why
02:30 - you started coding in the first place so
02:31 - like I'm actually giving this advice
02:33 - from the bottom of my heart like if
02:35 - there are no freelancing opportunities
02:36 - and there are no coding opportunities at
02:38 - all then don't do it
02:40 - then do something else okay just like be
02:43 - very practical about what it is that you
02:45 - need to do like I don't care if you code
02:46 - and make your income from coding or you
02:48 - do something else like as long as you're
02:51 - very resourceful of what you do and how
02:53 - you do it okay with that said
02:55 - freelancing opportunities will be hard
02:58 - and even when people get those
03:01 - opportunities they don't want to apply
03:03 - even when they get those opportunities
03:05 - sometimes they don't want to take action
03:06 - on it sometimes they don't want to go in
03:07 - for the interview sometimes you might
03:09 - not feel like applying to one more
03:12 - client like I tell people hey if you're
03:14 - gonna make a platform you're gonna make
03:16 - up yeah like a profile on a platform
03:19 - like why is that or take lessons to
03:21 - coach people in coding here's a student
03:22 - Casey who's a student at clever
03:25 - programmer and he also has a profile and
03:29 - as you can see he's gotten multiple
03:30 - students he also has four reviews and
03:32 - from there he's been getting lots of
03:35 - work and he's made decent Emma he's made
03:37 - a few thousand dollars from just
03:39 - teaching others already in just a few
03:41 - months okay here's his LinkedIn profile
03:45 - so you guys can go and check him out or
03:49 - message him whatever the case may be
03:51 - here's Jesse
03:53 - who's another student and she has a
03:54 - profile on take lessons for teaching
03:58 - beginners Python and she has a profile
04:03 - on wise and as well you need to be like
04:07 - reaching out to 50 to 100 people a day
04:10 - if you don't feel like it well do it
04:15 - anyway
04:16 - all right so something some days it'll
04:19 - be really hard I know some days if it's
04:21 - really hard then apply to one person
04:24 - apply to five people all right you don't
04:26 - have to do it for 50 things code for one
04:29 - hour instead of coding for five or ten
04:31 - hours at a time but start do a little
04:37 - every single day even if you don't have
04:41 - motivation and especially if it's hard
04:43 - my friend do it anyway
04:47 - that's it raining out here in Chicago
04:52 - I'm back in Chicago right outside a
04:54 - Starbucks but I just launched my earn 1k
04:56 - program and this is a program if you
04:58 - want to know how to land your first
04:59 - client and really get started because I
05:01 - know a lot of you are beginners a lot of

05:07 - help you because you'll learn how to get
05:09 - that first client if you haven't already
05:11 - but this program really goes hard on the
05:13 - soft skills that you need to succeed and

05:27 - below and check out I have a pretty epic
05:29 - video there for you so you can learn
05:30 - more about it being completely broke to
05:33 - then learning how to code in just a few
05:35 - months landing my contract as a
05:37 - freelancer with Python and being able to
05:40 - make $20,000 Wow I am enjoy that's it
05:44 - I'm coffee I'm gonna go hang out with my
