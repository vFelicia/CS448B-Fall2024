00:00 - hey guys what's up how's it going this
00:03 - is Kazi from clever programmer dot-com
00:08 - we are gonna see how this livestream
00:11 - goes there's a lot of new things that
00:13 - I'm trying out but basically I'm gonna
00:15 - be talking about me moving to California
00:20 - and kind of what the new plans are at
00:25 - clever programmer so we're gonna jump
00:28 - into that also I'm testing a lot of this
00:31 - new setup so bear with me please during
00:34 - this live stream because I'm gonna be
00:35 - figuring out if things are working or
00:37 - not and checking a lot of things out
00:44 - cool so it looks like I'm live on
00:53 - YouTube now I want to see if I'm live on

04:24 - this is Kazi from clever programmer calm
04:26 - so basically what's going on is I am I
04:31 - have kind of decided that I want to move
04:35 - to this amazing state of California I
04:40 - was located in Chicago and that's where
04:43 - my office was and yeah and it's kind of
04:50 - crazy you know for you guys probably got
04:54 - you sick of seeing that white wall
04:56 - behind me and now it's not the white we
04:58 - have a little bit of a better background
04:59 - and and yeah and you know it's really
05:04 - cold it's really cold in Chicago it's
05:07 - like freezing so here it's a little bit
05:10 - nicer not that cold and I can actually
05:16 - walk around outside and and yeah not
05:20 - feel depressed and run into people and
05:23 - actually talk to people so yeah I like
05:27 - that a lot better
05:28 - you know here so far at least in the
05:31 - wintertime you know cool hi guys hi hi
05:38 - hi please don't spam in the chats
05:44 - that'd be great what up dog where are
05:49 - you from hi studios how are you doing hi
05:57 - hi hi
06:00 - and by the way if you guys have
06:03 - questions you want to throw up throw at
06:05 - me go for it
06:07 - by the way nobody linked me for the
06:09 - YouTube live what's going on there guys
06:11 - I haven't gone any no I'm not gonna miss
06:18 - the cold I can tell you that much I'm
06:20 - not gonna miss it
06:21 - nobody linked me the video hmm you guys
06:25 - are evil okay let me try another way I'm
06:31 - trying to do something cool but it won't
06:34 - work unless I get the link to the live
06:36 - video on Facebook so I'm gonna go get it
06:39 - usually I have people helping me with my
06:41 - live streams but today I don't cuz my
06:44 - friends are in Chicago and you know
06:47 - cluck Co some of you guys might know or
06:48 - Mustapha he a lot of times Halston in
06:51 - the live stream and he's not here so I'm
06:55 - feeling the pressure right now but let
06:59 - me try let me give it a try let's see
07:05 - here
07:13 - yeah everything is like loading super
07:17 - slow it's like the slowest load you can
07:20 - imagine on the planet I got to get
07:23 - something better than a laptop and if
07:25 - you guys have questions you know throw
07:27 - them my way and I'll take them on for
07:29 - you
07:35 - hi Sajid hi harsh
07:59 - geez okay yeah so hopefully it's not
08:06 - lagging too much or anything but yeah
08:08 - basically I want to I'm souping up all
08:11 - of the setup and making it really
08:14 - high-quality everything for you guys so
08:16 - as you can see even the live streaming
08:19 - is gonna be looking a lot better than
08:20 - before and I just want to make sure that
08:24 - you know all the content you guys get
08:26 - it's like top quality and there's no
08:28 - sacrifice when it comes to quality and
08:30 - it's like everything is good while I'm
08:34 - here I'm gonna be basically now looking
08:36 - for a place and trying to find a nice
08:43 - place in California here and pretty much
08:46 - that's gonna turn into like a start-up
08:49 - place so I'm gonna be there and then I
08:52 - have a few friends who are gonna come
08:54 - and live there and we're pretty much
08:57 - gonna be like running clever programmer
09:00 - you know together essentially as a team
09:05 - and so you're gonna see a lot better
09:09 - quality material and you're gonna see a
09:12 - lot more content kind of on the daily or
09:14 - yeah like I'm not sure if I'm gonna put
09:17 - out videos every single day but I'll
09:21 - probably put out more videos than once a
09:24 - week on YouTube for example and then
09:26 - also the quality of like all the courses
09:29 - and everything's gonna you know go next
09:31 - level so yeah I'm really excited about
09:33 - that I'm gonna go turn off this
09:36 - animation I just have it on because it's
09:38 - kind of cool let's see
09:41 - I still don't have that link on let's
09:45 - see
10:00 - Wow it's looking clean all right now I
10:07 - want to try something and crossing my
10:11 - fingers that it works well so we'll see
10:17 - we shall see my friend
10:39 - okay so sreeram asked is it possible to
10:43 - learn Python by own let me take so guys
10:46 - good questions on Facebook I'm gonna
10:47 - take questions on Facebook and then I'm
10:49 - gonna answer them for you guys okay so
10:52 - let's see all right guys
11:04 - while you have me here live with you I'd
11:07 - like to take on your questions and kind
11:09 - of answer them for you one-on-one so
11:11 - take advantage of this opportunity you
11:13 - know like don't just put in like random
11:15 - like for example we have questions like
11:17 - how to become perfect coder that
11:20 - question is not gonna help anybody okay
11:23 - and it's too broad so what I want you to
11:27 - do is like come up with more specific
11:29 - questions because if I take your
11:31 - question answer it essentially like
11:33 - you're on a one on one call with me and
11:35 - if you were on a one on one call I mean
11:38 - you got to ask me one question that I
11:40 - could answer for you think about what
11:43 - could it be you know so yeah basically
11:47 - take advantage of this opportunity and
11:49 - come up with your good questions and
11:51 - write them down and put them in the
11:53 - comments and I'll answer them for you
11:58 - all right so I'm gonna put this comment
12:01 - and let's see if we'll be able to show
12:04 - this all right cool so Shriram Krish
12:13 - asks is it possible to learn Python by
12:17 - own I think what he's trying to say is
12:21 - is it possible to learn Python on your
12:24 - own right by yourself yes it's very
12:27 - possible a lot of people learn on their
12:29 - own and some of the tools that could
12:32 - help you is like a lot of these online
12:33 - resources right so you have Coursera you
12:37 - have Udacity you have EDX and the list
12:41 - goes on there's team treehouse and there
12:45 - are also a lot of books like the
12:48 - computer science book by John Zell it's
12:50 - a good one
12:51 - so yeah there are a lot of resources
12:53 - obviously the best resource on Python is
12:56 - clever programmer comm definitely take
12:59 - advantage of that if you're starting out
13:01 - I think it's the best resource to get
13:04 - started with so all you have to do is go
13:07 - to clever programmer comm and my free
13:10 - course will be there sign up for that
13:12 - free course and then it walks you
13:13 - through step by step for Python and we
13:18 - do it in like a project-based way so we
13:20 - build projects okay
13:21 - and yeah that way you get to kind of
13:25 - learn it hands-on so definitely take
13:27 - advantage of that I'm gonna go and see
13:31 - if there are other comments that we have
13:52 - hey guys how's a live stream on YouTube
13:55 - it's saying something about bad quality
13:58 - but I just want to make sure if it's
14:00 - good it's complaining complaining about
14:11 - something not sure what all right let's
14:16 - see if there's another good question we
14:19 - got get comments all right that's a
14:26 - pretty good question and all right
14:32 - basically a question is what is the best
14:33 - way to start GUI programming with Python
14:37 - and let's see so GUI means a graphical
14:47 - user interface so it's basically like
14:51 - developing something where it's not just
14:53 - code by itself it's taking the code
14:58 - right kind of what's in your head and
15:00 - turning it into an application something
15:02 - that has clickable buttons essentially
15:05 - the code is connected with something you
15:08 - can feel and see and touch and click
15:11 - like buttons graphics on it that's
15:14 - essentially the idea behind GUI
15:16 - graphical user interface right for
15:19 - example if you're using a software like
15:21 - Final Cut Pro you don't have to write
15:25 - code you're working with actual software
15:28 - you can click buttons and then do things
15:30 - right if you have to upload an image
15:32 - somewhere you don't have to go and find
15:35 - the path of the file and exactly where
15:37 - it's located that'll be too much work
15:39 - you just click upload and then it gives
15:43 - you everything that's like you click
15:45 - point and click right that's GUI so the
15:50 - best way to learn it is you know look up
15:55 - tutorials on to kinter I have a course
15:57 - on this my olp course which is currently
15:59 - closed you can't access it right now but
16:02 - it goes through
16:04 - - Kantor works but you can look online
16:06 - for tech enter in Python and it's
16:09 - spelled TK I and ter and it teaches you
16:15 - basically it's a framework to help you
16:18 - build local apps on your computer that
16:22 - are GUI apps so people can actually
16:25 - click on it and instead of having to
16:27 - write code they can make it work just by
16:29 - point click pressing the keyboard for
16:32 - example if you want to make a game like
16:33 - ping pong or pong on your computer you
16:36 - will use something like graphical user
16:38 - interface like GUI development and make
16:41 - that game in Python on your computer and
16:45 - John's ellsberg computer science Python
16:49 - programming I think it's called touches
16:50 - on it a little bit and then also online
16:53 - courses on to kinder touch on it and
16:55 - yeah I just want you to go and start
16:58 - throwing yourself in there and then take
17:01 - the code from those games and see the
17:03 - things that you can change in there
17:04 - right so like for example one thing you
17:07 - could do is just like find working code
17:09 - somewhere online that runs a game like
17:11 - pong or some other game copy paste it
17:15 - click the play button so it plays and
17:18 - your locum and then like start messing
17:20 - around like maybe there's a velocity
17:22 - variable and it says 80 on it change it
17:26 - to 20 does it slow down the speed of the
17:28 - ball when you hit it maybe there's a
17:30 - variable called paddle width if you
17:33 - change it to 10 instead of 60 does a
17:36 - paddle now become smaller so yeah like
17:42 - throw yourself in there and then kind of
17:44 - learn like that you know like earlier I
17:45 - was trying to livestream to my private
17:48 - group the profitable programmer group
17:50 - all the students who join that course
17:52 - it's currently closed and I was telling
17:56 - them to accelerate your success the
17:59 - secret to accelerating your success and
18:01 - getting success fast is accelerating
18:03 - your failure and if you can accelerate
18:07 - how fast you fail and how quickly you
18:09 - fail you'll be in a pretty good spot
18:14 - because you're going through the
18:17 - iterative
18:18 - pretty quickly you're learning what
18:19 - doesn't work and you're going to and
18:21 - then you improve so look to fail and
18:24 - look to fail fast fail fast fail often
18:27 - and that's how you'll improve a lot and
18:30 - how you'll get better a lot in
18:32 - everything in life coding fitness dating
18:36 - whatever it is just fail often and
18:38 - you'll improve okay that's how you get
18:41 - better at anything use fear and failure
18:45 - as your navigation in life for example
18:48 - if you go to the gym and you're just
18:49 - lifting five pound dumbbells you're
18:51 - always succeeding or if you're squatting
18:53 - an empty bar you're always succeeding
18:56 - but you're not improving there are two
18:59 - different things how you're gonna
19:03 - improve is by picking up a weight that's
19:05 - gonna push you to your limits to where
19:07 - you're gonna fail or it'll be close to
19:09 - failing and then you can use that as
19:12 - your navigation to then know okay here's
19:15 - how I can improve and go beyond this
19:17 - level so you definitely want to have
19:22 - something along the lines of that you
19:23 - know your fear and your failure as that
19:26 - navigation and use that when it comes to
19:31 - learning as well look to fail and look
19:34 - to jump into things quickly okay and
19:36 - don't wait around don't be like oh am I
19:39 - ready yet to do GUI development or am I
19:42 - ready to do X or Y just jump in and do
19:46 - it and fail in it and then you'll
19:50 - improve fast okay let's see if you have
19:59 - some good questions
20:12 - all right Rizvan Khan asks I have a
20:15 - question he says why do you prefer
20:17 - coding with the Mac than Windows I
20:21 - sometimes hear people saying it's better
20:23 - for Windows I love back and I am NOT a
20:33 - fan of Windows I have to like crazy
20:39 - Windows laptops like sitting right by me
20:41 - they're like super powerful and yeah I
20:46 - don't use them at all I I mean it's just
20:48 - personal preference guys everybody has a
20:50 - preference some practical reasons why I
20:54 - give you Wow well that I'll give you why
20:57 - I prefer Mac over Windows let me just
21:00 - say this first ultimately it doesn't
21:02 - matter you can become a coder using
21:04 - Windows or Mac okay so before you go
21:08 - crazy I just want to put that out there
21:10 - so don't break your budget and buy a Mac
21:13 - after listening to me I'm just gonna
21:15 - tell you personally my experience and
21:17 - why I like it more when you're coding
21:22 - and let's say you're using something
21:23 - like Python there are a few simple
21:25 - things that are already helpful first of
21:27 - all Python comes already installed on
21:29 - Macs so that's kind of useful but the
21:33 - more useful things are the terminal and
21:36 - the command line of Python command line
21:39 - is pretty much where you're gonna do
21:40 - most of your coding from okay once you
21:43 - become a little bit better you're gonna
21:45 - be doing a lot of stuff from the command
21:47 - line and if you're a beginner you might
21:50 - not be touching it right now but later
21:52 - it is something that's really important
21:54 - Windows command lines is really whack
21:57 - it's really really not that good okay
22:03 - let me put it like that if you have to
22:07 - follow a tutorial and you're trying to
22:09 - find a product let's say you're trying
22:10 - to follow a tutorial to do a Python
22:12 - project okay so you're looking up online
22:14 - and somebody's showing you how to build
22:16 - this app with Python or how to build
22:18 - this game with Python you're following
22:20 - along all those tutorials are made for
22:23 - mac or a bun - or some
22:26 - else like some kind of Linux but for
22:28 - Windows a lot of the times they'll have
22:30 - like here's a simple way of doing it in
22:33 - Mac but if you want to do two windows
22:34 - click this link and then it takes you
22:36 - into a completely new place and it's a
22:38 - different way of doing it for Windows so
22:40 - a lot of the times tutorials are a
22:41 - little bit more difficult and different
22:44 - for Windows because of how you know even
22:48 - their paths and their variables and all
22:51 - of that work yeah I don't want to get
22:55 - too deep into it but suffice it to say
22:58 - dad's you're gonna save yourself a lot
23:01 - of headache and a lot of pain if you are
23:06 - coding on a different OS than a Windows
23:10 - but again it's definitely possible there
23:15 - are hundreds of thousands of developers
23:17 - that became developers using a laptop
23:20 - like a Windows laptop
23:22 - there are also some online solutions you
23:24 - can use to program in again
23:26 - this is not that big of a problem on
23:28 - your advance so I'm not talking about
23:29 - anybody who's advanced once you're
23:31 - advanced you'll make everything work but
23:38 - when you're more like beginner and
23:39 - intermediate and getting started the
23:42 - windows will just throw more hurdles
23:44 - your way that just makes certain things
23:46 - difficult ok so I'm gonna leave that at
23:50 - that and yeah let's move on
24:04 - on don't copy/paste questions there are
24:07 - some good questions I see but they're
24:09 - just like spamming it and yeah I'm not
24:15 - gonna incentivize that so just guys
24:17 - don't don't spam please
24:28 - that's a good question I'm trying to
24:36 - bring it onto my screen give me a second
24:39 - here
24:46 - okay Henry mom asks why do programmers
24:52 - and developers use multi screens
24:56 - that's a good question I actually have
24:58 - multi screens right now this one here
25:00 - and then this one here but obviously
25:03 - it's also because I'm broadcasting and I
25:04 - want to see what the hell's going on
25:06 - but why we a lot of times use more
25:12 - screens or like on will have an external
25:15 - monitor when we're coding is because
25:17 - when you're coding you have something
25:21 - like pycharm or sublime text or an atom
25:23 - open and then which is your coding
25:26 - editor and then you have a command-line
25:28 - tool open and then you also are doing
25:32 - research on something like stack
25:33 - overflow and then you might have
25:36 - something like github open you can't fit
25:39 - all of those screens into one I mean you
25:41 - can but it'll look really small
25:42 - especially on a laptop so a lot of times
25:45 - when you have multiple screens you can
25:49 - have coding unlike one side and then you
25:52 - have your research on the other side and
25:54 - this way you can code and look at the
25:57 - research at the same time okay simple
26:01 - answer for that
26:31 - alright let's take this question on
26:52 - oh yeah somebody asked me what else
26:54 - inspired you to move to California I
26:56 - forgot to mention there's a lot of stuff
26:59 - happening here like every there's a lot
27:02 - of like life here and a lot of people
27:04 - here and a lot of people to connect with
27:06 - so as being somebody who's creative and
27:09 - into connecting with people and building
27:15 - something big and being an entrepreneur
27:17 - this is like the hub this is where you
27:20 - want to be so I'm probably gonna be
27:22 - living in LA and there are a ton of
27:26 - other youtubers and content creators out
27:28 - there and when you connect with
27:29 - like-minded people or people who are
27:32 - better than you not just like-minded
27:33 - like people who are next level above you
27:35 - right I'm a student of life I don't want
27:38 - to be in any place where I am like you
27:42 - know at a spot where I don't have other
27:43 - people who are ahead of me or I can
27:46 - learn from and in in Chicago that's not
27:49 - it's not like that's the case but it's
27:51 - just that there's no like central hub
27:53 - for youtubers or people who create
27:55 - content or people who market online or

29:26 - what we're working on you know so we are
29:28 - we have our new course a profitable
29:31 - program before we had our Opie course
29:34 - which taught people how to create
29:36 - graphical user interfaces we had a
29:38 - course we have a course on learning
29:40 - basics of Python but then very quickly
29:43 - what we moved on to now is our new
29:45 - course a profitable programmer the goal
29:47 - here is to get you like real-world
29:49 - clients and actual business with Python
29:53 - and focus on getting you paid breaking
29:57 - out of your 9 to 5 getting you to you
30:03 - know it's not about like all this
30:04 - traveling you know it's some more

30:17 - let me know but that's one of the goals
30:20 - to help people live the lifestyle they
30:23 - want you know and Python and programming
30:27 - and software developments kind of a tool
30:28 - for that is a vehicle for that end
30:31 - result and that's what I want to focus
30:34 - on and yeah even this new course that
30:37 - we're creating I mean I can already tell
30:39 - you it's the best Python course that
30:44 - there ever is going to be not in terms
30:46 - of like how much technical stuff am i
30:48 - teaching you and we're gonna build 3,000
30:51 - apps but the goal here is to get you

31:10 - and now week two is gonna be getting
31:13 - released soon
31:14 - and in this week they're gonna be
31:16 - covering like the fundamentals of Python
31:18 - week one is all about like mindset and
31:20 - hacks and yeah it's pretty powerful and
31:24 - some of the students in the in the
31:27 - course are already you know creating a
31:31 - group and then they're getting on those
31:33 - group calls and helping each other out
31:36 - and collaborating which I thought was
31:38 - pretty cool so good job on that guys I

32:17 - and Instagram to actually go live let me
32:22 - remove this thing here let's see if
32:28 - there any other questions
32:30 - [Music]
32:45 - let's see okay I'm gonna read some
32:47 - YouTube comments YouTube people are
32:50 - awesome and I need to give them love as
32:54 - well
32:55 - so let's see what's going on here
33:08 - what things to do I need to know to
33:10 - start learning Django fundamentals of
33:13 - Python and if you know like the basics
33:15 - of Python you're ready to learn Django
33:18 - yeah I see a good language to start
33:25 - I wouldn't recommend see I would
33:27 - recommend Python number one
33:30 - javascript is another good one to start
33:32 - with scratch if you have extra time
33:38 - start with scratch yeah
34:03 - all right I'm going to take some
34:05 - questions and answer them for your
34:10 - beautiful faces so let's go
34:29 - all right what is the best Python editor
34:32 - what is the best editor in Python let's
34:34 - take this question on where did I go
34:44 - just vanished
34:57 - hmm
35:02 - certain things are just not showing and
35:06 - sorry guys I'm trying to figure out this
35:09 - livestream stuff at the same time as
35:12 - answer your questions and run between
35:16 - all these things and it's just my tiny
35:17 - laptop today so sorry about any little
35:22 - problems we're having I'm trying my best
35:25 - to fix them for you and not drop the
35:31 - ball okay here it is what is the best
35:34 - editor in Python so there are different
35:37 - editors you have sublime text you could
35:39 - use atom my favorite one is pycharm not
35:47 - something I recommend if you're a
35:48 - beginner to use it
35:50 - I would say like start with the pure
35:52 - basics idle like IDL II start with that
35:56 - if you're starting out then promote
35:59 - yourself to something like sublime or
36:01 - atom then two three four months of using
36:05 - that I would say go to pycharm it's a
36:11 - beast and once you set it up it's when
36:16 - you can lock it in its I mean nothing
36:19 - even comes close I have my setup pretty
36:21 - dialed in with that but that took a long
36:23 - long time to just dial it in but yeah
36:28 - once you soup up your app I charm
36:30 - nothing even comes close but I would say
36:32 - wait on it first become proficient with
36:35 - programming and then get to the editor
36:40 - cuz the editor itself can be a whole new
36:42 - learning curve so you don't want to be a
36:43 - beginner and then also be learning how
36:46 - to use integrated development
36:48 - environment an IDE like PyCharm you want
36:51 - to just stick with basics okay so good
36:56 - question Meyer
37:01 - um yeah so guys this is kind of the
37:04 - reason I'm moving out here I think it's
37:06 - just cool and it's awesome and yeah you
37:11 - guys are gonna be seeing a lot of new
37:12 - content a lot of new cool stuff so stay
37:15 - excited for that thank you guys for
37:18 - coming here and watching this live
37:21 - stream my computer and everything is
37:24 - super slow and crashing so I can't even
37:27 - really see the things I need to be
37:31 - seeing and hopefully in the next
37:35 - livestream it'll be better and a little
37:37 - bit more streamlined for you guys okay
37:38 - so thank you guys so much for being here
37:40 - as always I love your faces off and I'll
37:44 - see you in the next video and now we're
37:50 - gonna go and close it okay
