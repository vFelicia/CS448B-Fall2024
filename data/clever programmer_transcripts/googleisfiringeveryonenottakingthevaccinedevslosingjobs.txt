00:07 - google tells employees they'll lose pay
00:09 - and will eventually be fired if they
00:11 - don't low vaccination rules
00:14 - basically what google is saying is hey
00:16 - if you don't get the shot
00:18 - you're out and you're fired and this
00:21 - will cause havoc for so many developers
00:24 - and so many developers that have looked
00:26 - up to google and have loved google and
00:28 - now are gonna be uprooted simply because
00:31 - of a decision and a choice for their
00:33 - health that they're making themselves
00:36 - and if they don't do it then well too
00:38 - bad it doesn't matter you know if if
00:41 - you're working if you're a developer it
00:42 - doesn't matter how many years you've
00:44 - been working here sorry either you're
00:45 - gonna start having to uh get pay cuts or
00:49 - you're out and you're done with the
00:51 - company and you won't be working anymore
00:53 - as you would expect the employees fought
00:56 - back and the vaccine mandate has not
00:58 - been universally accepted by employees
01:00 - surprise surprise several hundred google
01:02 - co-workers have signed and circulated a
01:04 - manifesto opposing the company's
01:07 - requirements which leadership said would
01:08 - apply to all employees even those
01:11 - working from home who engage directly or
01:14 - indirectly with federal government
01:16 - contracts even working from home that's
01:19 - insane it's like imagine you're a
01:21 - developer and you're working from home
01:22 - and you're like hey i don't want to take
01:24 - the shot and they're like yep you're
01:25 - fired
01:28 - now the biden administration has
01:29 - actually ordered this with in companies
01:31 - with over 100 or more workers to ensure
01:34 - everybody's fully vaccinated and in
01:36 - response google has asked more than 150
01:39 - thousand employees to upload their
01:40 - vaccinations
01:41 - vaccination status to its internal
01:43 - systems by december third
01:45 - i'm just gonna jump in and add a couple
01:47 - of my own thoughts actually i was having
01:49 - a conversation about this with my
01:51 - girlfriend a few days ago and i was like
01:55 - i'm all for all types of things right
01:58 - but when it comes to this type of stuff
02:00 - it's like i get it they're both
02:02 - different sides to this but i think at
02:04 - the end of the day people should be
02:06 - allowed to come to their own decision
02:08 - and they should be able to make their
02:10 - own choice you know ultimately it's like
02:13 - i'm for the choice that each person
02:15 - makes because at the end of the day if
02:17 - there's a developer that's working here
02:19 - that does not want to put something in
02:20 - their body because they don't feel
02:22 - comfortable i think they should be
02:23 - allowed to do that
02:25 - i think it's people's choice
02:27 - and i think that's kind of where it
02:29 - makes it tricky right even if you look
02:31 - over here it says in section title
02:32 - represe respect the user this is in the
02:34 - manifesto and it says authors write that
02:37 - the mandate of barring unvaccinated
02:39 - googlers from the office publicly and
02:41 - possibly embarrassingly exposes a
02:43 - private choice as it would be difficult
02:46 - for the googler not to reveal why they
02:47 - cannot return
02:49 - so for example
02:50 - you know that is one of those things
02:52 - right they would have to reveal hey
02:54 - because i didn't get this shot i cannot
02:56 - return
02:57 - and that's a huge problem because this
02:59 - is your private
03:01 - health
03:02 - situation you know uh it would be like
03:05 - if
03:06 - everybody was supposed to just get a
03:07 - diabetes injection if you didn't get one
03:10 - you would not be allowed to come to work
03:12 - okay i get it this is different in this
03:14 - situation where you're actually going
03:16 - and you're kind of stopping a virus
03:18 - but still i feel like that choice should
03:20 - be left to the people and especially for
03:23 - people working from home if they're
03:24 - gonna work remotely like at least if
03:27 - they're just gonna work remotely let
03:29 - them work from home right and then the
03:31 - vaccination could not be required maybe
03:33 - you just can't come back to the office
03:34 - that could be one of the things
03:37 - so that's one of the things that's very
03:39 - tricky about the situation here's a
03:41 - point that i'd like to highlight the
03:43 - documents states
03:45 - it justifies the principle of division
03:47 - and unequal treatment of googlers based
03:49 - on their personal beliefs and decisions
03:51 - the implications are chilling
03:57 - this is something that should be very
03:58 - concerning for you and for a lot of
04:00 - people because i think it fundamentally
04:03 - starts digging deep into our human
04:06 - rights
04:06 - you know and our fundamental rights and
04:08 - i think it's some it's a conversation
04:10 - worth having and anytime a side just
04:12 - goes you are wrong screw you for even
04:15 - bringing this up and tries to shut you
04:17 - up i think that's a problem i think both
04:19 - sides need to be listened to i'm not
04:21 - completely against the side that says
04:22 - hey this should be enforced and i'm not
04:25 - completely against the side that's like
04:26 - it should be an open thing me i'm more
04:29 - like it should be your decision at the
04:31 - end of the day on how you actually
04:33 - proceed with this okay and at the very
04:35 - least if you're a developer and you're
04:37 - working from home hey let them work from
04:39 - home maybe they just don't need to come
04:41 - to the office okay so even if you were
04:43 - to do this and enforce it make it so
04:46 - they can't come to the office and if
04:47 - they work from home then they should be
04:48 - fine
04:49 - so
04:50 - those are just my thoughts you know it's
04:52 - a modern world and i think that we need
04:54 - to create rules and laws that are
04:56 - flexible that
04:58 - then you know work with the people right
05:01 - and actually support the people and give
05:04 - them a choice but you know i don't know
05:06 - i don't know maybe you think different
05:07 - right let me know in the comments below
05:08 - what you think how it should be
05:10 - but when i saw this this and i saw this
05:13 - since you know earlier today and
05:15 - yesterday
05:17 - this concerns me and so what i because
05:20 - what i believe is going to be happening
05:21 - is a lot of developers are going to be
05:22 - losing their jobs a ton of developers a
05:25 - lot of them who maybe are choosing to
05:28 - not
05:29 - do the vaccine right and a lot of them
05:31 - are going to be losing their jobs so
05:33 - here's what i want to do because this
05:35 - type of [ __ ] pisses me off and i want to
05:38 - have everybody get a fair opportunity
05:40 - regardless of whether to get a vaccine
05:42 - or not because you know what it's none
05:44 - of my [ __ ] business it's your
05:45 - business okay whatever you do is up to
05:48 - you so
05:50 - me on the other hand i'm vaccinated but
05:52 - i'm not against whatever decision
05:54 - somebody makes okay there's just like
05:56 - religious beliefs i feel the same way
05:58 - and with all types of beliefs i feel the
06:00 - same way so look if you're a developer
06:02 - and you're concerned
06:04 - and you're about to lose your job at any
