00:00 - hey guys what is up this is Kazi from
00:03 - clever programmer calm and you're
00:05 - watching code Kadim e part 7 okay let's
00:11 - get started
00:13 - so we are at in unit 5 this means we
00:18 - have done more than 33% you guys 33%
00:22 - that's like the definition of 1/3
00:26 - alright so we're almost there umm lists
00:31 - and dictionaries so we are going to be
00:34 - covering like I said in the last video
00:36 - some really powerful constructs in
00:38 - Python lists and dictionaries alright
00:40 - they are easy to understand
00:45 - ok they're easy they're fairly easy but
00:48 - they're really powerful so let's get
00:50 - straight to it great job for making it
00:53 - this far okay
00:57 - introduction to lists so they're just
00:59 - giving us an introduction to lists how I
01:02 - like to think of lists is like a bucket
01:07 - right actually I just made that up I
01:10 - don't actually think of it like that but
01:11 - now that I'm thinking about it it's good
01:13 - to think of it like a bucket where you
01:15 - can put multiple things in there and
01:17 - that bucket could hold it okay so for
01:21 - instance imagine I told you create a
01:24 - variable called zoo animals and store
01:29 - bunch of zoo animals in there well you
01:32 - could say penguin and just a string
01:35 - right without using actually any fancy
01:37 - list so you could say penguin seal
01:43 - elephants running out of animal names
01:47 - here lion I keep wanting the red banana
01:51 - but okay penguins steal elephant and
01:54 - lion alright you could say well that's a
01:57 - perfectly fine way to do it okay but
02:01 - what if you want to pull out seal you're
02:04 - going to have hard time doing that right
02:06 - what if you want to pull out the second
02:07 - what if I told you what's the second
02:09 - animal pull out the second animal from
02:12 - zoo animals so let's just take it to
02:15 - repel IT and paste it there actually you
02:20 - should I share this okay so i've what
02:25 - i've just done effectively is I've
02:27 - shared this if you go to this link here
02:30 - you can see all of this code that I
02:32 - typed okay so if you actually go to this
02:36 - link you can see that code that we
02:40 - worked on in the last video all right so
02:43 - I'm gonna um call it clever programmer
02:53 - function right cool
02:59 - save yeah I think the link is not that
03:03 - one D i/o and okay great now let's open
03:10 - up on new page languages Python 3 and
03:16 - let's delete all
03:25 - okay
03:27 - so I'm gonna take that oops
03:30 - and I'm going to paste that right here
03:33 - all right this one so check it out if I
03:38 - said print if I want to get the second
03:41 - element that's going to be kind of oh
03:43 - and there's gonna be an ugly way to get
03:46 - it I'm going to zoom animals and then I
03:49 - have to like count so this is 0 1 2 3 4
03:54 - 5 6 7 8 so I'm going to say start from
03:59 - the 8th position and go to 9 10 11
04:06 - okay so start from 8 position and go up
04:10 - to the 11th position the first one means
04:15 - start the last one means stop but
04:20 - generally it's stop and then stop one
04:22 - element short okay so it's in up to but
04:27 - not including the last one so if I print
04:30 - it out you're gonna see sealed but this
04:32 - was a very cumbersome way to figure it
04:35 - out right second element I can't just do
04:38 - it without looking I can't just look
04:39 - away and say one and then or two and
04:43 - then it gives me seal I have to do this
04:46 - what I have to eyeball it and look at it
04:49 - and see how much now what if there were
04:50 - a hundred thousand animals and I wanted
04:52 - you know the 35th thousand one you're
04:55 - going to have a lot of trouble figuring
04:56 - that out
04:57 - however if it's a list right like a
05:02 - bucket
05:08 - let's put this here boom boom let's go
05:13 - there now in this scenario if I all I
05:19 - have to do is that goes ooh animals and
05:22 - if I want to get penguin I can go zero
05:24 - or if I want seal I can just go one and
05:28 - when I run it look at how beautiful that
05:31 - is
05:32 - none of that string slicing and going
05:35 - from eight to twelve and you know doing
05:37 - something like ninjas would do and
05:39 - jujitsu you're being very precise none
05:42 - of that stuff right we're not here to do
05:44 - surgery we're really here to do
05:46 - programming so let's keep it simple
05:48 - right keep it simple stupid kiss we're
05:51 - going to follow that so lists are great
05:54 - to keep a bunch of things together right
05:57 - otherwise we just create regular
05:59 - variable name and store a string for one
06:02 - animal right if you want it only one
06:04 - animal I would just say something like
06:06 - penguin but if you want to do multiple
06:10 - animals then it's much better to create
06:12 - a list okay okay so you see they have a
06:20 - list at the top if I call Len on a
06:25 - dysfunction Len on a list it works very
06:30 - similarly so I'm going to say print Len
06:35 - go at the end and I'm going to do this
06:37 - right and I'm not gonna say zoo animals
06:41 - of one I'm gonna say just call it on
06:44 - this entire thing so what do you think
06:47 - it's going to return to me do you think
06:50 - is going to return to me the letters in
06:53 - penguin sloths the letters number of
06:56 - letters and sealed plus the number of
06:57 - letters and elephant plus the number of
06:59 - letters in Lion sum it up and then
07:03 - return it or do you think is going to
07:06 - return to be four because there are four
07:07 - items in the bucket it's going to return
07:10 - to me
07:11 - four okay you see that little four right
07:14 - there that's why it's actually returning
07:17 - that
07:17 - because there are four items so here you
07:21 - see if the length of zoo animals is
07:23 - greater than three well is it greater
07:25 - than three you have one two three
07:28 - animals and obviously you separate it
07:33 - with a comma with a comma right here
07:36 - okay so we have three animals so this
07:40 - part is going to evaluate three is three
07:42 - greater than three false so it's not
07:46 - going to print any of this but if that
07:50 - was the case if this was somehow four
07:52 - and this whole thing evaluated to true
07:56 - then you would go down here and you
07:59 - would say the first animal at the zoo is
08:01 - plus zoo animal of zero right so what
08:06 - that would look like is if I rent that
08:13 - print statement guess I'm up my gosh
08:23 - okay if if I read this print statement
08:28 - right boom and ran it you'll see it says
08:36 - the first animal of the zoo is the and
08:38 - we use the indexing this is called
08:41 - indexing whenever you put a number in
08:43 - these brackets and get that element at
08:47 - that particular index what's called
08:49 - indexing so here we get the zeros item
08:53 - from the list which is really the first
08:55 - item if you think if you're if you think
08:58 - in how you're used to thinking in math
08:59 - and in human language this is going to
09:04 - get you the first element and if I go
09:07 - one now it's going to get you the second
09:09 - element which is the seal okay so we're
09:14 - concatenating this string with the
09:17 - zeroth element so here we're
09:20 - concatenating strings okay that's why
09:23 - you see this little plus sign here and
09:26 - then it's the same thing here second
09:28 - atom animal
09:29 - zoo is zoo animal of one-third animal at
09:34 - the zoo is animal of two and you get the
09:37 - idea I'm assuming they want us to add
09:40 - another animal here oh it actually says
09:42 - one animal is missing
09:44 - alright so let's just see what their
09:47 - explanation is Lister a data type you
09:49 - can use to store a collection of
09:50 - different pieces of information as a
09:52 - sequence under a single variable name
09:54 - look at how boring that sounds um yeah
10:01 - just put me to sleep reading it I don't
10:02 - want to read it again but essentially
10:04 - it's just a list of things in one place
10:07 - right that's why it's called the list
10:08 - it's like a bucket it's a list of things
10:10 - you just put it all in there in one
10:12 - place you can also have an empty list so
10:17 - right here you see it's just an open
10:18 - closed bracket that's just an empty list
10:20 - and if you call the function Len
10:23 - le n on that empty list it's going to
10:28 - give you back off it's going to give you
10:31 - back a zero right cool
10:33 - the list do animals has three items
10:35 - check them out inline one go ahead and
10:37 - add a fourth just enter the name of your
10:39 - favorite animal as a string online after
10:41 - the final comma before closing so here
10:46 - hmm what is my favorite animal I would
10:54 - have to go with koala bear I really I
10:57 - really love koala bears are really cute
10:59 - but I don't know if I want to hold one
11:02 - because they're dangerous and this
11:03 - sleeper I think 20 plus hours so um okay
11:11 - so this is great let's run it oh this
11:17 - part actually should not be true it
11:19 - should be if Len of zoo animals is
11:23 - greater than three okay so let's run it
11:27 - again because that's what it actually
11:28 - was before I changed it let's run it
11:30 - okay so I passed it anyways right I
11:34 - hacked my way through it okay so access
11:38 - by index you see now they're talking
11:40 - about the concept of
11:41 - index which is what I alluded to earlier
11:46 - so let's talk about this okay all right
11:53 - you can access an individual item on the
11:56 - list by its index so simple how I was
11:59 - showing you earlier if you want to get
12:01 - the first number here you do numbers of
12:04 - 0 and if you want to get the second
12:06 - number here you do numbers too yeah so
12:15 - this is actually the third number so we
12:17 - that's why we put 2 because we start
12:19 - from 0 and here we're adding basically
12:25 - this whole thing will turn to 5 and this
12:29 - whole thing will turn to 7 right so
12:33 - that's really the main part behind it
12:38 - listen this is begin with 0 not 1 so
12:40 - they're saying that an exclamation mark
12:42 - computer scientists love to start
12:44 - counting from 0 and there are good
12:47 - reasons for it which I might talk about
12:50 - later like not a not in Coke Adam E
12:53 - series in one of other videos because
12:58 - yeah it's it's a tangent so we don't
13:01 - need to discuss it right now write a
13:04 - statement that prints the result of
13:06 - adding the second and fourth items of
13:08 - the list make sure to access the list by
13:10 - index so we just have to write writing
13:18 - the prints the result of adding the
13:21 - second and fourth items of the lip so
13:23 - what they mean when deafening second and
13:25 - fourth is six and eight so second and
13:27 - fourth so we're actually going to say
13:30 - here numbers of 1 plus numbers of three
13:37 - okay so yeah so give that a try and see
13:44 - what happens maybe give it a shot and
13:46 - run it in rebel
13:52 - okay so yeah that person really wouldn't
13:56 - leave me alone okay new neighbors
14:03 - alright new neighbors
14:06 - write an assignment similar place the
14:09 - item that currently holds the value type
14:11 - great so now they're talking about how
14:13 - you can change things in lists which is
14:15 - so awesome
14:16 - okay you can't do that if you had a
14:19 - string I'll show you what I'm talking
14:21 - about
14:21 - so let me comment this bad boy
14:24 - and this one's well delete this guy try
14:28 - to Princeton now let's say I wanted to
14:31 - make the first element or the second
14:36 - element I wanted to make it Tiger right
14:43 - what I would do is I would sue animals
14:47 - get the seal right this would give me
14:50 - the seal and say make that equal to
14:55 - tiger
14:57 - simple as that now if I do print zoo
15:00 - animals look at that right and if I put
15:07 - a print statement before changing
15:10 - everything to tiger and run it you can
15:13 - see that of a seal and then when I did
15:16 - that whole thing with zoo animals one
15:17 - equal Tiger now it changed the seal to
15:21 - the tiger right now imagine if we had it
15:26 - as a string zoo animals animals is equal
15:34 - to penguin and seal right how I did it
15:40 - before and I found out that if I pulled
15:43 - from eight to twelve I would get that
15:45 - seal right if I did print zoo animals
15:50 - two from eight to twelve I will Dow pull
15:56 - out the seal portion of it and if I say
15:59 - change that to tighter
16:03 - whoops I have to take out the print
16:05 - statement you get an error because
16:09 - string object does not support item
16:12 - assignment okay what that means is that
16:15 - you can't change string items this is
16:18 - going to allude to a really tough
16:20 - concept later on called immutable data
16:23 - types but what that really means is
16:26 - something you can't change okay it's not
16:29 - that card so they're going to make it
16:31 - sound like mutable objects versus
16:33 - immutable objects when it's it gets in
16:35 - depth but at the very base of it at
16:38 - surface level is pretty simple
16:39 - so yeah string datatype
16:44 - right you can't change it versus list
16:48 - data type which makes it very easy to
16:51 - find the items and then change them and
16:53 - then string datatype it's hard to find
16:56 - the items and change them okay hard to
17:00 - find the item and impossible to change
17:02 - it cool so leave that there and leave
17:09 - this part here right all right let's go
17:11 - back so item that currently holds a
17:15 - value Tiger with another animal so what
17:18 - they're showing us as you can see here
17:20 - tiger is a third element and we need to
17:24 - change it with another element okay so
17:26 - we're going to add we're going to do zoo
17:28 - animals of three right that's how I get
17:34 - my tiger the third element and I'm going
17:36 - to say koala bear yeah the decided is
17:41 - how to change it we're going to change
17:43 - it right back okay congratulations you
17:47 - finish this section list capabilities
17:50 - and functions beautiful so we have
17:53 - finished this section um and let's go on
18:00 - to list capabilities and functions you
18:03 - guys later rivals and list length okay
18:11 - so this is going to be a really nice
18:13 - section because it has to do
18:15 - with lists and lists or such a common
18:20 - thing you're going to be doing
18:21 - programming like the last 30 or 40
18:25 - programs I wrote none of them I wrote
18:29 - without a list so lists were useful and
18:33 - also the current job place that I'm
18:36 - working for and I'm doing a software
18:38 - development work for them I'm using
18:40 - lists like over and over and over again
18:44 - so it's a really powerful tool at your
18:48 - disposal
18:49 - so it's good to learn it well a list
18:52 - doesn't have to have a fixed length you
18:53 - can add items to the end of a list so
18:55 - basically they're saying like let's say
19:00 - we have a list here right like letters
19:02 - ABC now we can add more things to this
19:06 - and in a much easier way like you don't
19:10 - have to redefine this list and go a
19:13 - comma B comma C and then you go comedy
19:18 - right you don't have to do it like that
19:20 - there's a way to automate that process
19:22 - so one thing that we can use is called
19:25 - append a pen means to put something at
19:30 - the end okay so what that would mean is
19:34 - we put something right here got it not
19:40 - prepend
19:41 - which would mean put something right
19:43 - here but I'll pen right over here so I'm
19:48 - going to go letters dot a pen and I'm
19:54 - going to say D and now if I print out
19:57 - letters you're going to see that it has
20:00 - a D at the end cool so it's a method
20:05 - that we use called a pen which is very
20:07 - common one of the most commonly used
20:10 - methods okay
20:12 - so print Len letters done and then if
20:15 - you print the Len of letters the length
20:18 - obviously is going to be four because a
20:20 - b c d and yeah alright so we print out
20:25 - for the lengths of the letters
20:27 - now instructions on lines 5 6 & 7 append
20:32 - three more items to the suitcase list
20:34 - just like the second line of the example
20:37 - above maybe bring a bathing suit haha ok
20:41 - so we're going to say suitcase data pen
20:43 - I don't know sunscreen sounds like we're
20:46 - going outside suitcase that app and
20:50 - bathing suit and suitcase dot a pad on
20:59 - towels right because we might be lying
21:02 - down on the beach and chilling and
21:04 - having a jolly ol time then setlist
21:09 - length equal to the length of the
21:11 - suitcase so I'm going to go right here
21:15 - and I'm gonna say Len of suitcase and
21:18 - without even running this code I can
21:21 - let's figure out and see what the length
21:23 - of the suitcase is going to be well we
21:26 - have an empty list here we start off
21:28 - with the empty suitcase we throw in
21:30 - sunglasses then we throw in sunscreen
21:33 - then we throw in bathing suit then we
21:34 - throw in towels hmm sounds like if you
21:39 - know how to count you'll probably know
21:41 - what Len of suitcase is right this part
21:43 - should evaluate to 4 okay
21:48 - there are % D don't get thrown off with
21:51 - this % D all this means is it's a
21:53 - placeholder for this variable in
21:56 - parentheses right here list length so
21:59 - this part will eventually turn into list
22:02 - length which will eventually turn into 4
22:07 - because we have 4 right here and then
22:12 - this will turn to 4 which will make this
22:15 - % d here turn into 4 okay so it's just a
22:20 - placeholder and they use % D here okay
22:25 - print the reason I didn't put 4 here is
22:28 - because what if you put sex 6 items what
22:31 - if you put 10 items so it needs to be
22:34 - able to change that number of items
22:35 - every time print suitcase
22:39 - cool we did it okay let's move on all
22:44 - right we have a suitcase with sunglasses
22:47 - hat passport laptop suit and shoes one
22:51 - two three four five six items now if we
22:55 - go from the 0th item to the second item
22:57 - we should get sunglasses and hat okay so
23:03 - let's give it a try I'm going to take
23:05 - this and copy it go to ruffled i.t paste
23:07 - it here and anytime you're confused just
23:11 - come here and run it okay don't let your
23:15 - ego get in the way of you learning like
23:17 - oh I'm too smart to try this and run it
23:20 - I just got it in my head everything even
23:23 - if sometimes you think you know it just
23:24 - go and try it anyways because it's good
23:26 - to build that muscle memory and it's
23:29 - just you know it gives you practice and
23:32 - you'll learn you really learn these
23:34 - things that way okay if I run this you
23:39 - see sus sunglasses and hat again it
23:42 - starts from the number you give it so
23:45 - start and then it stops at the number
23:48 - you give it except it's like stop -1 it
23:51 - stops right before the number you give
23:53 - it ok so if you give it the address of
23:57 - passport which is that location 2 is
23:59 - going to stop right before passport is
24:02 - going to stop up to the Hat so I was
24:03 - going to give you the first two elements
24:06 - all right
24:15 - now get the third and fourth items so
24:19 - how are we going to get the third and
24:21 - fourth items suitcase of two and four
24:28 - okay because this is really the third
24:33 - item and this is the fourth item that's
24:38 - another reason why we start with zero
24:40 - and stop before the other number so you
24:44 - can see we do zero to two and then here
24:46 - we just do two if we have to do zero to
24:49 - three right we would have to do or I'm
24:54 - sorry yeah we did zero to three now it's
24:58 - going to be a little bit trickier I
25:00 - don't know what I'm kind of set I lost
25:03 - my train of thought let's keep moving on
25:04 - let's pretend that never happen for okay
25:11 - cool
25:12 - let's keep on rolling now last one I
25:19 - mean and but one one point I would like
25:22 - to make is because of how we stopped
25:28 - before that last element and we start
25:30 - from zero to get the length of how many
25:32 - things you're getting all you have to do
25:34 - is the last the stop you give it - the
25:38 - start so stop - start will equal the
25:42 - length okay so in this case you have or
25:46 - let's just stick with how Python does it
25:49 - so stop - start so in our case the
25:55 - length will be equal to four minus two
25:58 - right and that will give you two so that
26:05 - is one reason why it's useful so see I
26:07 - do know I'm talking about
26:08 - all right let's go down here on line
26:13 - four create a list called middle only
26:16 - the - blah blah create a last made up of
26:19 - the last two items so what I'm gonna say
26:21 - is suitcase and start from four
26:30 - right
26:34 - whoops oh the point I was trying to make
26:38 - was if let's say you wanted to get if
26:43 - you wanted to go to this item this item
26:45 - right and you instead of wanting to say
26:50 - this for hat you said um like instead of
26:55 - saying this to go from sunglasses to hat
26:58 - you wanted to say one well the problem
27:02 - now is that if you do one here you're
27:06 - going to start from hat right so to make
27:10 - it easier for you instead of always
27:12 - having to do one plus one here so
27:16 - basically starting from two it's much
27:19 - simpler to just go to okay that's where
27:22 - I'm going to start off from because
27:23 - that's where I left off okay that was
27:25 - the point I was trying to make earlier
27:26 - now in suitcase
27:30 - we start from four again without even
27:33 - thinking because I see four is where I
27:35 - three is really rest off that all right
27:38 - um and so I'm going to start from the
27:43 - fourth element because we went up to but
27:47 - not including that and then I'm going to
27:50 - go five which is really the sixth
27:53 - element shoes so if I hit save and
27:56 - submit what's the problem here or sorry
28:01 - okay I should really be doing this right
28:11 - okay or another way to do it is just not
28:19 - put anything or just leave it okay start
28:23 - next lesson slicing lists and strings so
28:28 - we wanna I showed you guys a little bit
28:31 - of slicing strings so here we
28:35 - effectively go slice up to cat slice dog
28:39 - and then frog and then we can create a
28:42 - list based on those three guys all right
28:49 - so if I put this guy here and if I want
28:52 - to get cat well how will I do it
28:54 - animals from zero or blank to three zero
29:02 - one two three is the D part but remember
29:07 - we stopped right before it so that will
29:09 - pull out cat so cat is equal to that
29:13 - pounded dog I can say animals of three
29:17 - remember that trick um
29:21 - now dog is three letters so I can
29:24 - effectively go and say you know three
29:28 - plus three because three is where I'm at
29:30 - and I want to go three letters more from
29:33 - it but let's keep it consistent and go
29:40 - to go step by step so this is three four
29:43 - five six right so we can also do six now
29:49 - let's print out cat and dog and let's
29:54 - see if it's actually what we expect
29:57 - right so we got cat and dog just like we
30:01 - expected or if we did that trick of
30:03 - three plus three without really thinking
30:05 - about it cuz we know it's a three-letter
30:07 - guy we have there and we're sort of in
30:10 - the third position and then we can go
30:14 - for frog the trick we can do is well we
30:19 - left off at six we'll start from six we
30:21 - left off at
30:22 - gee and so now if I put six here that
30:26 - starts me off from that F and just :
30:30 - so that means keep going until the thing
30:33 - ends so if I print that frog here as
30:37 - well you'll see that it says cat dog and
30:39 - frog just like we expected or I can
30:42 - count so zero one two three four five
30:47 - six seven eight nine and I can put nine
30:51 - here or sorry ten here and all right we
31:00 - have to go one after that and they'll
31:02 - give us frog so it's just better to
31:06 - leave it as blank if you want to go all
31:08 - the way to the last one cool another
31:12 - trick is that thing you can you should
31:14 - be able to do negative one and a lot of
31:16 - the times that should work but not in
31:18 - this case so let's go run and here's
31:21 - what we get but to get the last element
31:24 - a lot of the times if you want that you
31:26 - can do negative one like this that'll
31:30 - give you the last element okay so if I
31:32 - go BOOM BOOM
31:35 - you can see that I get the last letter
31:37 - in this case so I get the Jeep cool
31:41 - let's go back so what we did we can just
31:45 - literally incop copy and paste that
31:47 - right because that's what they're
31:48 - effectively trying to do okay save and
31:58 - submit
31:58 - boom done okay so this video is getting
32:02 - pretty long I'm gonna cut it off right
