00:00 - - Hey you,
00:01 - I am coming to you live from Miami Beach.
00:04 - In this video I'm gonna talk about
00:06 - why you should learn
Python programming in 2019.
00:09 - And thank you, somebody
gave me actually help
00:11 - even with that title as well
00:12 - 'cause that's not one of my strengths.
00:14 - But what I do wanna talk about is
00:16 - why that's gonna be so
important and I wanna talk about
00:18 - a few predictions into the upcoming years.
00:21 - So a little about it is job
opportunity, like overall,
00:24 - why you should actually
give a shit, the big reason,
00:27 - and then we can talk about
some the nerdy reasons
00:30 - why Python is cool.
00:31 - That's the part where I get excited about.
00:33 - Why learn Python?
00:34 - Without any further ado,
let's jump right into it.
00:38 - Why learn Python?
00:39 - Well, what I want to talk about is
00:41 - why learn programming
first of all in general.
00:44 - You wanna be able to
have more job security,
00:47 - you wanna have a job
that most of the world
00:50 - is gonna be moving towards,
but more importantly,
00:53 - you wanna do something that's exciting,
00:54 - you wanna build or create
something from your head
00:56 - and get paid for it.
00:57 - Those are the reasons why I
like programming in general.
01:00 - But if you look at Forbes, I
was reading something on Forbes
01:04 - and it said, by the time its 2030,
01:06 - 800 million jobs will
actually be taken over by AI.
01:12 - For example, your Uber or
your Lyft and all these things
01:15 - that self checkout services.
01:16 - All of these things are
gonna be done by something
01:19 - with AI and probably
not gonna have drivers
01:21 - or people at the cash registry.
01:23 - So what that means is the
worlds gonna be moving to people
01:27 - who can actually program
and create those things.
01:29 - So the job opportunity for
people who are programming
01:33 - will be improving in the upcoming years
01:36 - and the upcoming decades, all right?
01:37 - So that's gonna be one exciting part.
01:40 - Now, why Python specifically,
01:42 - well because most of this is
gonna require data science,
01:45 - machine learning,
01:46 - and Python is actually one of
the best languages for that,
01:51 - and it's becoming hotter and
hotter for those reasons.
01:54 - So its becoming the most common
than norm for when it comes
01:59 - to data science, machine
learning, what have you.
02:01 - That's gonna a skills sets
that's gonna be tougher
02:03 - for you to learn but if you learn it,
02:04 - you're gonna be pretty much unstoppable
02:07 - in the upcoming years.
02:08 - So that's one huge reason
I mentioned Python.
02:11 - Other reasons why I mentioned Python,
02:13 - I mentioned it in lots of my other videos
02:15 - like Top Four Programming
Languages to Learn First
02:17 - or Top Five Programming
Languages to Learn First,
02:20 - but the reason I mention Python so much
02:22 - is because its ease of use,
02:24 - how close it is to reading like English,
02:28 - the writing is a lot easier
and its just lots of things,
02:31 - just work common scenically.
02:33 - For example, if you're
doing something in C, C++,
02:36 - you gotta tell the
freaking thing what type,
02:38 - what data type you expect
this function to return.
02:41 - Sometimes if you don't do that,
02:43 - the function will break down.
02:44 - So these are more of
the nerdy things, right?
02:46 - And if you are new to coding,
that thing can stop you
02:49 - in your tracks because if you're new,
02:51 - you don't freaking know
what data types even are,
02:54 - much less what the data type
the function is gonna return.
02:57 - So good luck learning about
a function which requires you
03:00 - to know data types when
you don't know data types.
03:02 - So, it just adds more complexity
03:04 - and that's just one example of it.
03:07 - Python, there's such
simple tools you can use
03:10 - to actually run Python.
03:11 - For example, if you look up
Repl.it, R-E-P-L-dot-I-T,
03:15 - the CEO and founder of Repl.it
03:18 - actually worked on lots of other things.
03:20 - Like he was an engineer at Facebook,
03:22 - and he founded, obviously,
Repl.it, which is now used
03:25 - by many, many different
companies including Google.
03:28 - Amajad made a fantastic tool.
03:32 - You can go on this tool
03:32 - and you can use some
other languages too there.
03:36 - One of the languages that's
really easy to use online there
03:39 - is Python, and you can
actually just run your code.
03:42 - You don't have to install anything,
03:43 - you can just get started.
03:45 - So it's really good for
if you're a beginner,
03:48 - and its also really good if you are
03:50 - even a more intermediate developer
03:53 - because the skill set of
this will take you forever
03:56 - to master, right?
03:56 - 'Cause programming ultimately thinking,
03:59 - the syntax doesn't matter so much.
04:00 - But you also don't want the
syntax to stop you from learning
04:04 - or improving and getting better faster.
04:07 - So those are a lot of the reasons
04:08 - why I am such a big proponent of Python.
04:13 - The community of Python is fantastic.
04:15 - If you go to events like Pycon
that take place every year,
04:18 - I mean, those are some of
the most amazing events
04:23 - you can go to, and when it comes
to lots of other languages,
04:26 - they have their own, but Pycon
is personally my favorite.
04:31 - Other than that, besides having
better job opportunities,
04:37 - salaries for developers
04:38 - ranging from $60,000 to $70,000 a year
04:42 - all the way to about
$300,000 a year or more,
04:44 - but it depends what type of
job you're doing obviously.
04:47 - For example, if you are
doing something very basic,
04:50 - you are not very good at Python,
04:53 - something that most other
people are dealing with,
04:55 - just for example, if you're
doing web development,
04:57 - which is still a useful skill
but there's so many people
05:01 - that are web developers.
05:03 - You can be making between
$16,000 to $100,000 a year.
05:08 - But, if you are a quant and
you're a data scientist,
05:12 - then its very possible you
could actually be making
05:15 - around $200,000, $300,000 a year or more.
05:19 - Like at Wall Street,
05:20 - some of these quants are
making $500,000 a year.
05:24 - That's a really high number
but I actually wanna tell you
05:27 - what that range can look like,
05:29 - depending on your skill set,
05:31 - your ability to be irreplaceable,
05:33 - like how hard it is to replace you, right,
05:36 - And then how good you are at what you do.
05:38 - This is something Bob Proctor
talks about which I love,
05:41 - and he said, "Three things
will determine your income.
05:46 - "One is the demand for
what it is that you do,
05:50 - "second is how good you are at that thing,
05:53 - "and third, which is actually
one of the most important,
05:56 - the third thing is, how
hard is it to replace you?
06:01 - So Python, there's huge demand.
06:03 - If you take the time
and become good at it,
06:05 - that's gonna be amazing, right?
06:06 - If you can take the time
to become good at it.
06:08 - And number three, if you become
so good that its really hard
06:13 - to replace you or you're
doing something so difficult
06:16 - that its really hard to replace you,
06:18 - you're automatically gonna be at a point
06:20 - where you can demand a much higher income
06:23 - without being irreplaceable.
06:25 - So those are a lot of the
reasons why I love Python.
06:28 - Now, some of the more
technical reasons are that
06:30 - its a very well developed language
06:32 - with an amazing community.
06:34 - So for a lot of things,
you can go on GitHub
06:36 - and you can look up these projects
06:38 - that are already completed,
06:39 - and there's a big community support,
06:42 - so you can actually just
use a lot of those libraries
06:45 - to make things work for yourself
06:47 - and most of it is really straightforward.
06:50 - Most of the stuff you
can just do pip install
06:52 - and install these new packages,
06:54 - you can bring in new
libraries into your own code
06:57 - and be able to work on
these much bigger projects
07:00 - without running into even
installation problems.
07:04 - Then other nerdy reasons
that are good is that
07:07 - you don't have to compile
code to make it run,
07:09 - you can run it on the fly.
07:12 - So yes, overall it makes the speed
07:14 - of your code a little bit slower
07:16 - but there are packages that
can take your Python code,
07:18 - your particular Python code,
07:20 - and almost make it as fast as
a programming language like C.
07:24 - So its not like you're
really losing speed either.
07:27 - And other reasons is because its easier,
07:29 - it allows you as a developer
to be more effective
07:34 - and productive so you can
actually be doing a lot more
07:38 - with your time because
if you are learning,
07:41 - or you're doing something
with another language,
07:43 - sometimes a language
itself can slow you down,
07:46 - and you have to create lots
of things from scratch.
07:48 - For example, take something like C;
07:49 - you have to create almost
everything from scratch.
07:53 - It doesn't encourage you to use
a lot of existing libraries.
07:55 - So, it's good in its own way
07:58 - depending on the type of
projects you're doing.
08:01 - But for most of the other
things you're doing,
08:03 - whether it's web development,
front end development,
08:05 - back end development,
08:06 - you're doing regular software development,
08:08 - Python is really powerful
because it makes you
08:11 - much more effective and
productive at writing at code.
08:15 - You don't have to do
everything from scratch.
08:17 - You can leverage a lot
of the existing tools.
08:21 - Now, other reasons I mentioned
in many of my other videos,
08:24 - but if you're new to the
channel, first of all,
08:25 - I just wanna say thank you for being here.
08:27 - Consider subscribing.
08:28 - There's a lot of tools, tips and tricks,
08:30 - motivational stuff, negotiation stuff,
08:32 - everything to help you
become a better developer,
08:35 - land a job and be on your path
08:37 - to become a six-figure developer.
08:38 - Now with that said, let me continue.
08:40 - So, those are other reasons,
but in my other videos,
08:43 - what I have said a lot is that
08:45 - lots of companies are using it as well.
08:48 - So, you wanna see what companies
08:49 - are using your programming
language and how popular it is.
08:52 - For example, there programming languages
08:55 - that are not used a lot.
08:56 - Scheme is not used that much.
08:58 - PHP is an ugly language and
most people are kinda going away
09:03 - from it even though a big
part of the world is doing it,
09:06 - but the scope of it in the
future is not looking that great.
09:10 - Then you have other
languages which are smaller
09:12 - and hot and upcoming but
you look at something
09:14 - that has data in the past and
has a higher upward trend.
09:18 - Python has that, and Python is used.
09:21 - Google is mainly developed by Python.
09:25 - Sergey Brin says, "Python
where we can, C where we must."
09:30 - So the founder of Google says that.
09:33 - He's trying to use
Python wherever they can
09:35 - and then C where they must.
09:36 - So that should tell you that
its an awesome language.
09:39 - Google is using it, Instagram
is built mainly off of Python,
09:44 - Quora is is built off of Python,
09:46 - Dropbox is built off of Python, Hipmunk,
09:50 - and the list continues to go on.
09:52 - But my point with telling
you these things is that,
09:54 - look, big companies are using it,
09:57 - the predictions in terms of
what's gonna be happening
09:59 - in the future with programming
10:01 - and how programming is gonna
be taking over lots of jobs
10:03 - and things are gonna
be moving more and more
10:05 - to web development and data
science and machine learning
10:08 - and all of that, Python is predisposed
10:11 - to be powerful in that
and is becoming the norm
10:14 - for all of those.
10:15 - So that's gonna give you a bigger trend.
10:17 - In 2018, it was Google'd
more than Kim Kardasian,
10:20 - I should also tell you its pretty popular.
10:22 - With all, and Python programming,
10:24 - we're not talking about python snake.
10:26 - So if you take all of
these things into account,
10:29 - what you get is a powerful language
10:32 - that will give you job stability,
10:33 - which gives you a strong future,
10:36 - which makes sure none
of your time is wasted
10:38 - into actually learning it,
Which puts you in a place
10:41 - where you can potentially
be earning a high income,
10:43 - let's say in a few years,
10:45 - and you can even get on your path
10:47 - to making six figures or more.
10:48 - Again, that depends on
what your overall goal is.
10:51 - It gives you opportunities
to work as a freelancer,
10:54 - a consultant, a full-time developer;
10:56 - its a language that has all
those options open for you.
11:00 - And if go deep into it and
work on just problem solving
11:04 - and becoming a better developer,
11:05 - the future for you is
very, very, very bright.
11:09 - Now, you can be in any language.
11:11 - The most important things
are to understand concepts.
11:13 - I get that, but I want
you to pick something
11:16 - and work on a language
where you're not worrying
11:18 - about the syntax so much.
11:20 - You can just do what you
came here to fucking do,
11:24 - build projects, build real
world practical applications
11:27 - as fast as humanly possible,
be as effective, productive,
11:31 - and efficient as fast as possible.
11:33 - And the computer and programming,
11:36 - its like a genie on your side.
11:37 - You have infinite power.
11:39 - If you tell the computer
what to do it will do it,
11:42 - but you need a tool to
be able to speak to it.
11:44 - So it's like genie with infinite powers,
11:47 - but the only way to speak to it
11:49 - is though programming language.
11:50 - Why not pick a language that's the easiest
11:53 - to speak to the computer
with instead of a language
11:55 - that's really hard.
11:56 - Like, you can speak to people in Mandarin
11:59 - or you can speak to people
in Spanish, or English,
12:02 - or some other language in real life.
12:04 - You wanna start off with
the easier language,
12:06 - then maybe learn Mandarin, right,
12:08 - 'cause Mandarin is gonna be a lot harder.
12:10 - So, similarly, when it comes
to programming and development,
12:14 - learn to express your
thoughts, emotions, feelings,
12:17 - real world applications and all that
12:18 - through a programming
language that's easier
12:21 - and has an amazing future.
12:23 - And then, if you wanna branch out
12:25 - and learn some other stuff, go for it.
12:27 - That's gonna be awesome.
12:30 - That's what I wanted to share with you.
12:31 - Thank you so much for watching.
12:32 - As always, I love you face
12:34 - and I'll see you in the next video.
12:37 - I have an incredible video
that I want you to go and see
12:40 - that I've put together, okay?
12:40 - This video is unbelievable.
12:42 - This video will show you how
I went from being a dumb,
12:45 - broke Oaktan Community College student,
12:47 - to making $104,000 a year as a developer.
12:50 - What would it mean for you
12:51 - if you made your first $1,000 from coding?
12:55 - What would it mean for
you if I reveal to you
12:57 - my step-by-step system that I used to go
13:01 - from completely broke to
then learning how to code
13:05 - in just a few months, landing
my contract as a freelancer
13:10 - with Python and being able to make $20,000
13:13 - while I was a terrible Oakton
Community College student.
13:17 - And to then being able to
live the lifestyle I want
13:20 - on my own terms and have the
ability to have my own time,
13:24 - freedom, money, and have the
ability to make an impact
13:27 - on the world.
13:28 - And at the same time,
travel with my friends,
13:30 - be there for my family when
we hit 300,000 subscribers,
13:33 - go to all these events,
even now I'm in Miami,
13:36 - 10X Growth con with Grant Cardone.
13:39 - How does that lifestyle come about?
13:41 - As a Python developer,
13:43 - I was able to create that
lifestyle for myself.
13:45 - And in this video I wanna show you the,
13:47 - how you can do that for yourself.
13:49 - Take students like, for
example John Navarro,
13:52 - who went from working
with me from complete zero
13:54 - to becoming a senior data scientist.
13:57 - Or Nazar Mally, who
landed $130,000 contract
14:01 - and now he is moved to
Germany with his family
14:03 - and living an amazing life.
14:04 - Or Afrin Shaik who was
able to make $20,000
14:08 - after she took one of our programs.
14:10 - But before we continue,
I do wanna talk about
14:13 - the opportunity that exists
in 2019 and moving forward
14:17 - as a Python developer.
14:19 - So please go watch this video.
14:21 - Its an epic video I've put together,
14:23 - click on the link below
in the description,
14:26 - and its gonna take you to it.
14:27 - With that said, thank
you so much for watching.
14:29 - As always, I love your face
14:30 - and I'll see you in that other video.
14:32 - So go click there. I'll
see you right there.
14:34 - Click there. Do it.
14:36 - Do it, do it, do it.
14:42 - (upbeat bouncy music)
