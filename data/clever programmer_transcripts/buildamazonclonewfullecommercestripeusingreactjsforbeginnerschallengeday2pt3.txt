00:09 - that's good
00:10 - nice what's up guys
00:13 - i think we are back all right we are
00:17 - back you guys
00:18 - guys so sorry about this but this is
00:21 - gonna
00:24 - change this up we shouldn't be so it
00:30 - looks like because this connection guys
00:32 - is having a little bit of issues if it
00:34 - does cut out guys
00:35 - don't worry we're gonna go through this
00:36 - entire thing for you guys so nothing is
00:38 - gonna get lost or missed
00:40 - uh you guys are gonna have the full
00:42 - clone and we're gonna go through all of
00:43 - this stuff
00:44 - so do not freak out guys i'm just
00:46 - getting everything on the screen and
00:47 - then we can go ahead and get started
00:49 - guys
00:49 - so let's do it starting soon and
00:53 - we need to go
00:58 - sunny will be there to guide you but
01:00 - keep going sunny
01:01 - yeah because i was just thinking shall
01:03 - we maybe um if you could possibly
01:06 - somehow um just zip the the
01:10 - zip the zip the code right now send it
01:12 - to me on slack i'll open it on bs code
01:14 - and it'll be much quicker we'll do it
01:15 - that way
01:15 - and we'll just carry on because right
01:18 - now in case the connection drops we're
01:19 - gonna lose everything that we've done
01:20 - here
01:22 - got it yeah okay right in the meantime
01:24 - guys let's go ahead
01:26 - and fire off some questions that you're
01:27 - interested about the challenge
01:29 - let us know who's here and we apologize
01:31 - for this connection stuff guys it
01:33 - it just happens when we go live
01:35 - sometimes and
01:36 - it's a pain but it's going to be fine um
01:42 - yeah like the game sometimes it just
01:44 - happens and there's really not
01:46 - much we can do about it even you know
01:48 - you don't want this to happen of course
01:50 - right exactly um
01:54 - let me see guys i think it's pretty
01:55 - clear now it should be pretty clear
01:57 - uh for you guys um let's go ahead and
02:00 - see
02:01 - so we've got lux miguel says hi carson
02:03 - sunny what's up
02:05 - um youtube is not working at all
02:10 - so guys the best thing you guys could do
02:12 - is definitely if you are coming from
02:14 - youtube or you saw that things weren't
02:15 - working
02:16 - so kazi has come back as build a
02:18 - whatsapp clone with the mansac
02:20 - so we just need to go ahead and change
02:21 - that name again all right well
02:23 - uh guys on youtube again
02:26 - okay now as it says it's done beautiful
02:29 - so yeah
02:30 - change the name again but um i think
02:32 - youtube should be uploading the previous
02:34 - ones even if it crashes
02:36 - yeah so we should have everything on
02:40 - right now nice awesome guys
02:44 - so we are back right we are back we are
02:47 - back
02:47 - nice so everyone should be rejoining if
02:50 - it's all working guys
02:51 - let us know where you're at right now
02:53 - are you actually i mean this might
02:54 - actually work out well for some of you
02:56 - guys because
02:56 - you guys might be able to actually catch
02:58 - up with us with what's happening
03:00 - and even if we do i think the connection
03:03 - may drop on kazi's end so it seems to
03:05 - like it it looks like we're having a
03:06 - little bit of
03:07 - problems with the connection but guys if
03:10 - your energy is real
03:11 - and if your energy is strong enough then
03:14 - we can crush this kind of stuff
03:15 - this is hard guys if we can't handle a
03:18 - few connection issues
03:19 - then how are we gonna handle debugging
03:20 - right so this is what happens when you
03:22 - code
03:22 - this is what we gotta get used to this
03:24 - stuff will happen
03:25 - but we will conquer it we will overcome
03:27 - it and we will crush this stuff guys
03:29 - um give me two seconds guys
03:34 - i'm just getting the file right now
03:37 - yeah i'm here i can i did so my screen
03:41 - is frozen but it's okay i can still talk

04:12 - second and then like upload is like 35
04:14 - just like your connection is excellent
04:18 - yeah oh man i'm just trying to unzip
04:22 - this okay it's just

05:05 - it's okay we can recover from it
05:07 - exactly we can come back from this guys
05:09 - it's all good
05:10 - right so i'm going to quickly pull in my
05:13 - code
05:13 - right now guys bear with me i'm opening
05:16 - up my downloads
05:17 - so let's go cd downloads and the file is
05:20 - the 8th
05:21 - of september there we go boom code
05:24 - insiders that's a little trick for you
05:25 - guys if you don't know this trick
05:27 - um inside the terminal so i have the
05:29 - code open guys
05:30 - let's go let's carry on at full speed
05:34 - guys
05:34 - who's excited drop it in the comments
05:36 - let's recover this and save this
05:38 - situation guys
05:39 - so let's go because he is so
05:42 - jokes man you froze in such a funny
05:44 - position
05:45 - and it's perfect perfect you can just
05:47 - use that as my image
05:50 - i'm smiling i'm happy i mean that's
05:53 - exactly
05:54 - perfect thing to freeze exactly dude
05:56 - it's the perfect thing to freeze
05:58 - right guys so here let's hop in back
06:01 - into the code so what we were doing
06:02 - previously i'm gonna go ahead and make
06:04 - this a little bit bigger for you guys
06:05 - so that you guys can see this and i'm
06:07 - going to go ahead and also
06:08 - pull up the actual clones next to the
06:12 - app so we can go ahead and see this
06:14 - in a very visual way so it's very simple
06:16 - for you guys to go ahead and see
06:17 - i'm also going to go ahead and pull the
06:19 - actual demo of the app because we're
06:20 - going to use this for reference when
06:21 - we're coding
06:23 - so this is the app and i'm going to go
06:25 - ahead and if you guys haven't already
06:27 - you need to do npm start so npm start
06:29 - like so
06:30 - and guys to be honest this would
06:31 - actually give a lot of you guys the
06:33 - chance to catch up on the build
06:35 - so use that time that you lost to go
06:37 - ahead and
06:38 - catch up and get caught up to the point
06:41 - that we're at right now
06:42 - so i'm just going ahead and installing
06:44 - the modules uh because
06:46 - i got cars these files sent over to me
06:48 - um so we're doing it on this machine and
06:49 - that should be done in just a sec but
06:51 - what we were doing guys is we were
06:53 - working on
06:54 - this right here so we were working on
06:55 - the amazon
06:57 - header so this thing right here at the
06:58 - top let's go ahead and it's just
07:00 - installed so we're going to npm start
07:02 - and boom guys we are back we are back
07:05 - we've got 1200 people
07:06 - uh okay what is that i have no idea
07:08 - anyway um
07:12 - god damn it dude the demo gods are evil
07:15 - today
07:16 - it's all good bro like as many
07:19 - challenges as you can throw on us now
07:21 - yeah everything exactly firebase went
07:24 - down something else
07:25 - [Laughter]
07:28 - exactly guys good bro exactly and look
07:31 - we've got people with the energy
07:33 - like nothing can stop us that's right
07:35 - guys nothing can
07:36 - stop us um exactly guys
07:40 - let's go so i'm gonna go ahead and make
07:41 - this super big right now
07:43 - so you guys can see everything and um
07:46 - there we go so you guys should be able
07:48 - to see everything clearly let me know if
07:50 - you can't
07:51 - in the comments but i think that should
07:53 - be clear right now um
07:56 - so with that said let's go ahead and
07:59 - carry on so we've got the
08:01 - header component at the top so what
08:03 - we're gonna do is we're gonna jump
08:04 - inside of that
08:05 - and inside the header component guys we
08:07 - are going to
08:08 - go ahead and check out so i'm just
08:10 - pulling up some notes so we've got
08:11 - everything available
08:13 - um so here
08:16 - so what we were doing right now is we
08:18 - were actually focusing on this guys
08:20 - this we built this part of the search
08:22 - right so with the search we actually had
08:24 - the header search the header search
08:26 - input and the header search icon we
08:28 - styled it to get it looking like this so
08:30 - in case you guys missed what we did
08:32 - there i'm going to go ahead and go into
08:33 - header.css
08:34 - and here is what we had we had the
08:36 - header search which was the container so
08:39 - this is the container for everything it
08:40 - was display flex flex one which
08:42 - flex one actually went ahead and gave us
08:45 - this
08:45 - where it's spread out to the rest of the
08:48 - um
08:49 - flex one basically says they want it to
08:52 - like stretch as big as it can go okay
08:56 - now what we're gonna do is we are going
08:58 - to do the right hand side so right now
09:00 - you can actually see what's over here
09:01 - but if i go ahead
09:03 - and zoom in you can see it says hello
09:05 - guest sign in all that
09:06 - beautiful stuff i want that to look like
09:08 - this okay so that's the end goal
09:10 - and that's where we're at right now so i
09:12 - mean it looks pretty close but we're
09:14 - gonna pretty much get to that finish
09:15 - line and get it looking
09:16 - perfect guys we have 1400 people back
09:19 - thank you so much guys for giving us
09:21 - that chance to get over this problem and
09:23 - we're going to keep crushing it for you
09:25 - guys
09:25 - so oh god got some flying okay we're
09:28 - going to keep on crushing it for you
09:29 - guys
09:29 - so let's go ahead and we've got the div
09:33 - over here
09:34 - and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
09:36 - have the
09:37 - so for each of these header options i'm
09:40 - going to start styling them as such
09:42 - as needed so the first one guys i'm
09:44 - going to go ahead and say header option
09:46 - so header underscore option like so and
09:49 - what i'm going to do here
09:50 - is i'm going to actually go ahead and
09:52 - find my styles for this
09:54 - i'm going to go ahead and give the
09:55 - following this i'm going to say display
09:58 - flex and what i'm going to do just to
10:00 - make it extremely easy
10:02 - because right now you can't actually see
10:04 - that text
10:05 - very easily you see on this one it's
10:07 - white so let's go ahead and actually
10:09 - give that white
10:10 - color right now so i'm going to say the
10:12 - color should also be
10:13 - white right so for now i'll just give
10:15 - the color of white
10:16 - i'm going to say display flex and we are
10:19 - going to say flex direction column
10:20 - margin left 10 pixels margin right 10
10:22 - pixels color white
10:24 - so you see right now it's squashed right
10:26 - everything is squashed up
10:27 - and the reason why this is is because we
10:29 - need to target the head and nav and we
10:31 - need to make this
10:32 - responsive so i'm going to go ahead
10:34 - target the header nav
10:35 - and let's go over to head and nav here
10:37 - i'm going to say display flex and
10:39 - justify content space evenly
10:41 - so what this will do is if we save this
10:43 - now you see that
10:44 - it actually went ahead and because we've
10:47 - set the rules of this
10:48 - image we've set the rules of this
10:50 - container right here so the search
10:52 - the search container and then the nav
10:54 - container all of them are abiding by
10:57 - flex rules so what that means is guys is
11:00 - that it's going to equally
11:02 - share that space between what is ev
11:04 - whatever is inside so now
11:06 - you can see it's starting to look a
11:07 - little bit more like the finished
11:09 - product right
11:10 - so we're almost getting there guys we're
11:12 - almost getting there well the next bit
11:13 - we're gonna do is we
11:14 - are going to target the option nine one
11:16 - so
11:18 - we had here header option nine one
11:20 - option nine two
11:21 - for option nine one we can go ahead and
11:23 - do the following we say
11:24 - target header option nine one and then
11:27 - we can do the following so
11:30 - flies okay header option nine one and
11:32 - here we've got a font size of 10
11:34 - pixels so um here we are going to do a
11:38 - font size of 10 pixels
11:40 - like so and then we're going to save and
11:42 - then we're also going to do an option
11:43 - nine two so here
11:50 - edge risa says you get them girls guys
11:53 - keep coding that's so funny i got that
11:57 - girl
11:58 - i know got them girls that girl all
11:59 - right so fun size
12:01 - 13 pixels front weight of 800. kazi are
12:04 - you still there
12:05 - of course bro i'm here in spirit and i'm
12:07 - [Laughter]
12:09 - i'm like like this loading energy now
12:11 - coming from the dead just
12:13 - it's so funny it's spooky when kazi is
12:16 - so quiet and not moving around but we
12:18 - love his smile
12:21 - somebody said love my mouth oh man
12:25 - somebody's like causing breathe man all
12:28 - right i'm here don't worry guys i am
12:30 - breathing
12:30 - just i got a very high quality noise
12:33 - gate on
12:34 - but you know it's so quick guys we're
12:38 - all good exactly right so
12:41 - we have the amazon clone we have amazon
12:44 - nav bar is looking clean it looks
12:47 - glitchy
12:47 - it looks like the amazon nav bar exactly
12:50 - it's looking clean guys
12:52 - now i saw somebody say what is the font
12:53 - family we didn't actually change the
12:55 - font so keep it as
12:56 - it is and everything will work correctly
12:58 - and it'll work as you expect
13:00 - so the final thing guys is we want that
13:02 - basket icon so this one on the right
13:04 - that nice little basket icon
13:06 - to go ahead and add that in what we're
13:08 - gonna do is the
13:09 - final uh header option needs to be added
13:12 - so the final header option that we're
13:14 - interested in here is this one over here
13:16 - so
13:17 - i'm gonna go ahead and add a div so i'm
13:21 - going to say div
13:23 - of header basket option oops like so
13:26 - option basket like that and inside of
13:29 - here
13:30 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to use
13:31 - the shopping basket icon from material
13:33 - ui
13:33 - so this we actually need to import so
13:35 - what i can do is i can click on the end
13:36 - of the
13:37 - name and i can do control spacebar and
13:39 - all my tricks not working okay so
13:41 - sometimes it doesn't work so what you
13:43 - need to do
13:44 - is manually go to the top and go ahead
13:46 - and do your
13:47 - typical import so i'm importing this
13:49 - from material ui
13:51 - and then we are going to have the next
13:54 - part of
13:55 - this uh so this actually needs to be oh
13:57 - yes we're gonna have this
13:59 - and then i'm gonna go ahead and add a
14:00 - span and
14:02 - this one guys is going to have the
14:04 - following class name so it's going to
14:05 - have two class names this one
14:07 - so i'm going to add the following ones
14:09 - so it's going to have a
14:10 - and this will say zero for now and what
14:12 - what we're basically putting here is
14:14 - this one
14:15 - right here guys so we're focusing on
14:16 - that zero now this
14:18 - has two class names it has header option
14:20 - line two
14:21 - and it has header basket count and this
14:23 - has a space bar between it guys so
14:26 - a space between it so you see there is a
14:27 - space between the two things
14:29 - okay so make sure you do that and this
14:32 - is because we're applying two different
14:33 - class names to this
14:35 - element at the top so we need to go
14:38 - ahead and
14:39 - style this stuff right here now what
14:42 - we're gonna do is first go ahead and
14:44 - target the option basket
14:46 - so i'm going to go ahead and say header
14:48 - option basket go into my css
14:51 - and let's check what needs to change so
14:53 - for the option basket i'm going to say
14:55 - display flex and align item center
14:58 - do that and we can see i'm actually
15:00 - going to change the color of it right
15:02 - now
15:02 - because we can't actually see anything
15:04 - with that so color white
15:06 - and now you can see we've got this
15:09 - so this is going to be important for
15:10 - later guys because we want this to be
15:12 - dynamic so if we go ahead and check the
15:14 - actual
15:14 - app you guys can actually see if i add
15:17 - to the basket
15:18 - notice how it actually goes ahead and
15:20 - updates over here
15:22 - okay so you can actually see their
15:24 - updates over in the top corner so if i
15:26 - go ahead and click
15:27 - and add some more items to basket it
15:29 - goes ahead and updates
15:31 - to the basket as such right so that's
15:34 - going to give us a clean
15:35 - look and feel to the app so
15:39 - with that we're going to carry on we've
15:40 - got the um
15:42 - basket looking a bit cleaner and then
15:43 - what we're going to do is we're also
15:44 - going to go ahead and target this header
15:46 - basket
15:47 - account so let's go back to our css
15:50 - let's zoom out of this page so we can
15:52 - see actually let's keep it zoomed in for
15:54 - now because that's kind of clean
15:56 - and then we're going to go ahead and
15:57 - give it a margin left and a margin right
15:59 - of 10 pixels
16:00 - so i'm going to go here i'm going to say
16:02 - target the basket count which is
16:04 - actually the span
16:05 - here and we're going to get say give it
16:07 - a margin left of 10 pixels and a margin
16:09 - right of 10 pixels
16:10 - okay now if we refresh we should be able
16:13 - to see everything is looking
16:14 - pretty clean okay so that is a clean
16:18 - finished header bar right so that's
16:20 - looking really really clean
16:22 - and what we want is it right now it says
16:24 - hello guest
16:25 - but the end goal would be when you sign
16:27 - in it will say hello sunny or hello kazi
16:30 - or whatever you're signed in as okay so
16:32 - it's going to be really really
16:33 - crucial to have this header looking nice
16:35 - and clean guys i also want to stress
16:37 - that look it's sticky so as we scroll
16:39 - down it sticks to the top of the web
16:41 - page so it's a very very clean
16:43 - um very very clean implementation we've
16:46 - done right now
16:47 - so with that said let me know if you're
16:49 - actually following to this point
16:50 - and if you're not it's completely fine
16:52 - so make sure guys remember as we said
16:54 - keep the energy high
16:55 - even sometimes just watching this stuff
16:57 - watching the content and then following
16:59 - it afterwards
17:00 - is more important i would say so make
17:01 - sure you follow this keep
17:03 - keep um optimistic and out of
17:05 - recognition this is how people
17:07 - get so good at things even if you
17:10 - just watched it and you didn't code
17:12 - along
17:14 - just a pattern recognition of you
17:16 - learning react
17:17 - hooks this is how this is built this is
17:19 - how this goes into the header
17:21 - if you just panic and spend all your
17:22 - time on panicking i saw somebody earlier
17:24 - in the stream and look i'm signing out
17:26 - like this is going too fast for me
17:28 - okay you're also not going to become a
17:29 - developer that's just the truth
17:32 - and so this is how people are weeded out
17:35 - but we want you to be that person who
17:38 - can actually stick
17:39 - through this and even if it doesn't make
17:41 - sense to you it'll make sense
17:43 - like your bill it's no joke you're
17:44 - building an amazon
17:46 - clone like amazon it took them
17:49 - decades to get to what they have right
17:51 - now those engineers are getting paid 300
17:54 - 000
17:54 - plus 400 000 plus a year
17:57 - we're doing that live in this challenge
18:00 - so of course some of the stuff isn't
18:01 - going to make sense
18:02 - but if you just quit out for that reason
18:04 - then you're also not going to become a
18:05 - developer
18:06 - so you have to pick your battles and
18:08 - stick through
18:09 - a goddamn thing and commit everybody
18:12 - who's here is committing
18:15 - so that is very very powerful and stick
18:17 - through it i mean
18:18 - we're all sticking through it with you
18:20 - exactly guys and guys like cars he said
18:23 - if you can't stick through this those
18:26 - numbers that we said yesterday
18:27 - want the 120k salary those things they
18:30 - require that 110
18:32 - that we talked about they require that
18:34 - discipline that sort of not quitting
18:36 - when the push gets
18:37 - when the push gets going and when it
18:38 - gets hard okay so just like now it's
18:40 - completely fine if things
18:42 - don't make sense do not quit though
18:44 - right do not quit keep that energy high
18:46 - and let's carry on so let's jump back
18:49 - into
18:49 - the code and you can see we've done the
18:52 - sticky top navbar in our build so it
18:54 - looks really really nice
18:55 - really clean and what we're going to do
18:57 - now is
18:59 - we are actually going to go ahead and
19:00 - build out the body of the app right so
19:02 - the body
19:04 - if we go over to our app.js we called it
19:06 - the home component
19:07 - let's go ahead and create that home
19:09 - component so here what i'm going to do
19:11 - is create home
19:13 - and i'm going to go ahead and create
19:14 - that file so i'm going to say
19:16 - home dot js and here i'm going to say
19:20 - rfce
19:21 - go ahead create that and you can see it
19:23 - opens up this i'm going to go ahead and
19:24 - give it a class name
19:26 - of home right now here i'm going to go
19:29 - ahead and say import
19:32 - home.css like so and i'm going to create
19:35 - the
19:36 - css file so i'm going to say home.css
19:39 - okay now here we have
19:43 - the home component loading right so just
19:46 - to prove we can say i
19:47 - am the home component like so
19:51 - we can go ahead and do this right so
19:54 - now what we can see is um
19:57 - if i go back to app i go ahead get rid
19:59 - of our little comment
20:00 - go back here say command space and
20:02 - import with our little nice trick so
20:04 - it's added this import statement
20:06 - save it now you should see here it says
20:08 - i am the home component
20:10 - okay so everything underneath you see
20:14 - everything here is going to be the home
20:15 - component
20:17 - so let's go ahead and deck this home
20:20 - component out and let's make it look
20:21 - good
20:22 - so what that what with that said guys
20:24 - we're gonna first have a
20:26 - container inside of our home component
20:29 - right so
20:30 - inside of here we're gonna have a home
20:32 - container so i'm gonna say home
20:33 - underscore container
20:34 - and i will and this is two underscores
20:36 - in case you're wondering it's part of
20:38 - the bem convention
20:39 - um a lot of people always ask what the
20:43 - drawing tool is by the way
20:44 - so this drawing tool that we use is
20:45 - actually called screen brush so if
20:47 - you're in case you're wondering there
20:48 - you go
20:49 - um so now what we're going to do is
20:52 - inside the home container
20:53 - we're going to have that beautiful
20:54 - banner that you see so this banner right
20:57 - here
20:58 - you see where it fades into the
20:59 - background right so this lovely little
21:01 - amazon prime bomber right here we're
21:04 - going to show you guys how to go ahead
21:05 - and build that
21:07 - so now what i'm going to say is i'm
21:09 - going to do image so image
21:10 - as such and then i'm going to go ahead
21:12 - and add a so i went ahead and found the
21:15 - amazon one that they use
21:16 - i'm going to go ahead and paste it in
21:18 - here so i've already got my quotes
21:20 - save and there you go so this is
21:22 - actually miriam real quick in the
21:24 - facebook group and she's like i'm
21:25 - literally sick right now
21:26 - but i'm doubling down on my efforts
21:29 - focusing on this
21:31 - got that on the screen that's awesome so
21:34 - you can't actually see the name but it
21:35 - says what's that miriam
21:38 - yep yeah nice she says i'm literally
21:40 - sick right now i'm focusing and putting
21:41 - double efforts i just love your
21:42 - tutorials
21:43 - guys that's the kind of energy we need
21:45 - here that's awesome and with that said
21:47 - we are almost back at 2
21:48 - 000 viewers so you guys are absolutely
21:51 - incredible
21:52 - and with this energy is what is this is
21:55 - the energy that we need
21:57 - to go ahead and hit those goals that we
21:58 - spoke about yesterday
22:00 - so you can see we went ahead and added
22:02 - the image
22:03 - here right here right but you can see it
22:05 - kind of spans across now this doesn't
22:07 - look right okay so we need to go ahead
22:08 - and fix this
22:09 - so let's go ahead and add a class name
22:11 - and we're going to add a class name of
22:12 - home
22:12 - image so i'm going to go ahead and add a
22:14 - class name of home image
22:16 - now let's go ahead and actually fix this
22:18 - right now so go to the home.css
22:21 - let's go ahead and pull that up right
22:22 - now and first thing we're going to do is
22:24 - the home
22:24 - container itself okay so the home
22:27 - container itself
22:28 - actually actually asked for the link so
22:31 - that link
22:32 - um you will so here's the thing some
22:35 - one of you type it actually in and then
22:37 - paste it in the comments
22:38 - so get somebody somebody from this call
22:41 - just please help out with that
22:42 - and also in the slack group i know we
22:44 - have over 9 000 people and they're
22:46 - actually helping out and dropping links
22:47 - to these things
22:48 - so look in both of those places exactly
22:51 - guys and if you're part of that slack
22:52 - community
22:53 - i've actually saved you guys a huge deal
22:55 - and i just went ahead and pasted that
22:56 - link
22:56 - inside the slack right now so you guys
22:59 - can go ahead and check inside slack and
23:00 - i've dropped that link
23:01 - but guys remember you can just pause the
23:03 - video and copy this out at some point
23:05 - afterwards as well
23:06 - so try not to get caught up on just the
23:08 - picture just remember what we're trying
23:10 - to learn here so
23:11 - now the first thing we've done is we
23:12 - gave it a home image class and what
23:15 - we're going to do is we're going to go
23:16 - ahead and style that
23:17 - so we're going to go ahead and say that
23:20 - this
23:21 - image so this home image should be
23:24 - of width 100 now you see guys
23:27 - look i'm just going to comment that out
23:28 - quickly right so this just these few
23:31 - lines of code
23:32 - and look at the difference that we got
23:34 - right there so if you think this is cool
23:36 - let me know let us know in the comments
23:37 - right now so
23:39 - we're firstly going to work i'm going to
23:40 - slowly uncomment this out so
23:43 - let's go ahead and first if we do width
23:45 - of 100 you can see it snaps everything
23:47 - into the viewport and this is responsive
23:49 - by the way
23:50 - so you can see everything is super
23:51 - responsive and then what i'm going to
23:53 - say
23:53 - is give it a undo this and we will also
23:55 - want to have a z
23:56 - index of a minus one so we want this to
23:59 - be behind anything else that's what a z
24:01 - index is
24:01 - i'm going to give a margin bottom of 150
24:04 - minus 150 and that means that
24:06 - elements afterwards actually going to
24:07 - creep into it
24:09 - mask image is what gives it that
24:11 - beautiful
24:12 - sort of a fade-in effect right so we're
24:14 - going to say start from the top to the
24:16 - bottom
24:16 - and this is basically just saying go
24:18 - from a
24:20 - uh opaque to um go from a completely
24:23 - um like complete color to see-through
24:26 - it's also a transparent so let's go
24:28 - ahead and save that
24:29 - and you get that really nice gradient so
24:31 - that's going to be really really clean
24:33 - and nice and i can see a lot of people
24:34 - actually dropping it in the chat
24:36 - that is really nice and that's the kind
24:37 - of stuff that we talk about guys that's
24:39 - what we're talking about nice
24:41 - right so that's what mask images as well
24:44 - so i saw
24:44 - a lot of you guys got excited about that
24:46 - so
24:47 - now with that said we're gonna carry on
24:50 - and inside of home container
24:54 - uh i think i can hear myself echoing a
24:56 - little bit on your mic cozzy
25:00 - just going to go ahead and go to home.js
25:06 - so now inside of home.js guys
25:09 - we notice we have these rows right so we
25:12 - have these different rows over here
25:15 - um
25:22 - right so now inside of these so you can
25:24 - see what we have is we have these
25:26 - containers here
25:27 - so here i have a row there's going to be
25:30 - one row
25:31 - and then i'm going to have a row over
25:33 - here
25:34 - hey sami anger card jumped in the chat
25:36 - he said stay hydrated guys
25:38 - he is 100 right i actually need a drink
25:40 - right now
25:41 - super thirsty so over here we are also
25:44 - going to have are you still laughing on
25:47 - my mic
25:48 - are you still liquid no no that's all
25:49 - good now that's so good
25:51 - something yeah something you you changed
25:53 - it but it's all good now
25:55 - got it so um
25:59 - now guys what we're gonna have is three
26:01 - of those rows right and these rows are
26:03 - gonna the really nice part about these
26:04 - rows are
26:05 - is that they're gonna be fully
26:06 - responsive so you see the top one has
26:08 - two
26:09 - the the middle one has three and the
26:11 - last one has one
26:12 - and the part of the homework is going to
26:13 - be that i want you guys to just pretty
26:14 - much play around with this and see what
26:16 - you can do with it
26:17 - but what we're going to do now is we're
26:18 - going to say div home underscore
26:20 - underscore row
26:21 - like this and we're basically going to
26:24 - go ahead and
26:25 - the goal here is to basically render out
26:27 - a product component so let's go ahead
26:29 - and say we had like
26:30 - the first one has two components and
26:32 - then we have another row so we have
26:34 - another row
26:36 - and this one is going to have three
26:37 - components so you can see right here so
26:39 - it has two components
26:41 - and it has three components and then the
26:43 - final one
26:44 - so dev home on this one scroll row this
26:47 - one has
26:48 - uh one component right so you can see
26:51 - exactly a really clear layout of what
26:53 - we're trying to achieve here
26:55 - okay so with that so you've got these
26:57 - three containers and you can see this
26:59 - one right here
27:00 - is reflecting so this one right here is
27:02 - reflecting
27:03 - this row over here and we have the two
27:06 - containers so this is that row over here
27:09 - this one over here is going to reflect
27:12 - these three over here and then
27:15 - we have the final one at the bottom
27:17 - which is pointing towards this one okay
27:20 - now this is going to um
27:23 - be completely responsive so it's going
27:25 - to calculate on its own
27:27 - based on how many products we put inside
27:29 - as to how to space them out and i want
27:31 - you guys in your homework to make sure
27:32 - that you go ahead and change this out
27:34 - and make it so that
27:35 - the first one might have one product in
27:37 - the second one might have five in the
27:38 - third one might have four in
27:40 - right so make sure you guys vary it up
27:42 - in your homework so we have loads of
27:43 - different projects that we can go ahead
27:45 - and demo
27:46 - and see um in a really nice cool
27:48 - demonstration tomorrow so
27:50 - in the first row we're going to go ahead
27:53 - and add a product but in order to have a
27:55 - product we need to make this product
27:56 - component
27:57 - so i'm going to go ahead and create that
27:59 - product component so
28:00 - product dot js
28:04 - like this and we're going to say rfce
28:07 - like so and here i'm going to say
28:11 - class name of product like that
28:14 - okay now here i'm gonna go and do our
28:16 - normal stuff i'm gonna say
28:17 - product is here so product dot css
28:21 - save it and we need to create that
28:22 - product.css so
28:24 - product dot css like this
28:27 - all right so we have the product over
28:28 - here and then what we're going to do
28:32 - is um then what we're going to do
28:36 - is we're going to go ahead and actually
28:39 - start coding out the product itself so
28:42 - the product itself is going to consist
28:43 - of a few things
28:45 - so it's going to consist of a title a
28:47 - price
28:48 - a star rating an image and then
28:52 - a add to basket button okay so we need
28:56 - to go ahead and drop this out now
28:58 - so the first thing we're going to do is
28:59 - we may have a sort of an info
29:02 - right so we're going to basically go
29:03 - ahead and wrap um
29:05 - all of the so everything you see here so
29:07 - let me go ahead and remove this
29:10 - everything we see here is going to be
29:14 - and i can see a lot of people dropping
29:15 - uh homework ideas we actually have a
29:16 - really nice juicy homework idea for you
29:18 - so
29:19 - it's going to be some fun for you guys
29:20 - afterwards
29:22 - um so here is going to be everything
29:24 - that we're going to basically be calling
29:25 - product info so
29:26 - here i'll say div product info like so
29:31 - okay and let me go ahead and make this a
29:32 - bit bigger there you go good product
29:33 - info and this is going to have a title
29:35 - in so let's go ahead and say
29:36 - the lean startup nice
29:40 - so there's the product info is basically
29:42 - going to be the
29:46 - yep so the product is yeah the product
29:49 - it just cut out a little bit but the
29:50 - product info is going to be this
29:52 - top part right here so this one for this
29:54 - one you've got the kenwood here
29:57 - the samsung etc all of that sd product
29:59 - info
30:00 - uh no sorry the product info is
30:01 - everything here sorry it's a container
30:03 - around all of these elements
30:05 - and then you've got in the individual
30:06 - things yeah so here we've got the
30:08 - product price now here i'm going to
30:11 - basically be
30:11 - i'm going to give this one a class name
30:13 - so this one's going to have a class name
30:15 - and then we're going to go ahead and say
30:16 - product
30:18 - price like so so product
30:22 - price and here i'm going to go ahead and
30:25 - say a small so i'm going to
30:27 - so inside that tag i'm going to give it
30:28 - a small tag and i'm going to say dollars
30:30 - because we're going to use dollars here
30:32 - and i'm going to say
30:34 - strong so this is a very quick way of
30:35 - making something bold and small
30:37 - here i'm going to say a price of let's
30:39 - just say the lean startup is let's just
30:41 - say 20 uh
30:43 - 1999. right
30:46 - now if we go back here what i'm going to
30:47 - do is i'm actually going to render this
30:49 - out as we do it so it should be very
30:51 - clear
30:51 - so i'm going to go ahead and replace
30:53 - this with a product component so this
30:55 - one should be
30:56 - product component now
31:00 - my one actually did a nice little auto
31:02 - import so you can see here it says auto
31:04 - import import product from product so if
31:06 - we go ahead and save
31:08 - we should be able to see now it shows a
31:11 - it shows down here so you can see it
31:13 - says the lean startup
31:15 - 1999 and this is coming straight from
31:18 - this product here and if i imagine we
31:20 - had two products
31:22 - save you can see two products show up so
31:25 - the angle is we're going to get this
31:27 - to this so this entire little square
31:30 - block
31:30 - so all of this white stuff is going to
31:32 - be the part of
31:33 - the finished product okay
31:38 - okay so now what we're going to do is
31:40 - inside of product.js
31:43 - we are going to go ahead and we've got a
31:44 - p tag here and i'm going to say
31:46 - the next bit is the product ring so
31:48 - we're going to have some kind of star
31:49 - rating here right
31:50 - so we're going to have a product ring so
31:52 - i'm going to call this one
31:53 - product rating like this
31:56 - and then inside of here guys what we're
31:59 - going to do is we're going to
31:59 - essentially have
32:01 - depending on whatever we pass in so
32:04 - if we passed in a prop value of like
32:06 - five or four or three then it will
32:08 - render out that many stars
32:10 - now what i'm going to do here is we
32:13 - actually just lost
32:14 - cars you guys so it will it may just be
32:16 - me until cause he jumps back on
32:18 - but let me know in the comment section
32:20 - if you're
32:21 - still pumped because we this is the kind
32:24 - of stuff that we have to deal with
32:25 - we have to overcome this sort of
32:27 - obstacles and tomorrow or maybe later on
32:29 - or very soon
32:30 - because we will be back guys so do not
32:32 - freak out we have
32:33 - a whole week and we are going to fall
32:36 - into these problems but it's
32:37 - it's up to us guys to overcome this
32:38 - stuff so let's carry on strong
32:41 - so here we've got a p tag and i'm going
32:43 - to go ahead and
32:44 - do a star like so and you can see like
32:47 - we've got the star rendering out
32:49 - now imagine i added in sort of a few
32:52 - different stars here
32:53 - so i want to add in like a few different
32:54 - stars so let's just say three stars
32:56 - okay so you can see like in here for
32:59 - example it says five so i'm going to
33:01 - show you guys
33:02 - how we are going to get to the end
33:04 - result okay
33:06 - so we have that right there and then
33:09 - we're going to have an image
33:10 - so the image is going to be an image of
33:11 - the product so let's go ahead and
33:12 - outside of here we're going to say an
33:13 - image
33:15 - and this is actually going to be outside
33:16 - the product info now so we're going to
33:17 - say image
33:19 - and here what i'm going to do is i'm
33:20 - just going to pop it on me for a second
33:23 - and i'm going to go ahead and find an
33:24 - image of the lean start because
33:26 - sometimes you don't know what google is
33:28 - going to throw at you
33:29 - especially on the demo the demo days so
33:33 - let's go ahead and copy the image
33:34 - address and
33:36 - um yeah go ahead and guys if you haven't
33:39 - already and you're enjoying this
33:40 - smash the thumbs up button and try and
33:42 - get this video out to as many people as
33:43 - you can
33:44 - obviously we had a few technical issues
33:45 - earlier but we are over that and we are
33:47 - going strong so let's go back to our
33:50 - source
33:50 - and then what we're going to do is we're
33:51 - going to paste this and what this is is
33:53 - this picture right here
33:54 - so you can see we've got the lean start
33:56 - so we've got two products being rendered
33:57 - right now because i'm dropping two
33:58 - products here so i'm going to go ahead
34:00 - and clear that up
34:02 - so we have our one product now
34:05 - with this guys what we are going to do
34:07 - is we are going to i'm just going to
34:09 - pause
34:09 - there we go that should be a bit
34:11 - smoother now so
34:13 - so the stars by the way guys many people
34:16 - are asking about these you can use a
34:17 - normal emoji
34:18 - you can literally go on google and put
34:20 - in a star you can put in whatever you
34:22 - want
34:23 - you can do pretty much anything like
34:25 - that and it's going to it should be
34:26 - completely fine
34:29 - um can you guys i'm sure you guys can
34:31 - see there we go
34:33 - um so we've got the so let's go ahead
34:34 - and just say a one star for now okay so
34:36 - it's got the one star here for now
34:38 - and what i'm going to do is um
34:42 - we are going to go ahead and see so a
34:45 - lot of people are saying you can't see
34:46 - the
34:47 - uh the stars but i think we're good i
34:48 - think we're all good guys so we've got
34:50 - the image back up and then we're going
34:51 - to go ahead and add a button
34:53 - so here i'm going to go ahead and add a
34:55 - button and that button is going to say
34:57 - add to
34:57 - basket okay add two baskets let's go
35:00 - ahead and save
35:02 - and now you can see if we go back to our
35:04 - app we've got the add to basket button
35:06 - hey so it's clean okay very very clean
35:09 - and now what we are going to do
35:12 - is we are going to style this because
35:15 - right now this does not look nice it
35:17 - does not look very good
35:18 - so let's go ahead and use that so let's
35:21 - go back to our product.css
35:23 - and let's make this thing look beautiful
35:25 - okay so the first thing we're going to
35:27 - do
35:27 - is we're going to go to our product and
35:30 - this is the bit i like because this is
35:32 - where
35:32 - as we do it you guys are going to go
35:34 - ahead and see all of the changes
35:36 - visually pop in right so here i'm going
35:38 - to say display flex
35:41 - display flex there we go so everything
35:44 - goes into a row
35:46 - i'm gonna say flex direction column so
35:48 - everything goes into your and that it
35:49 - looks horrible
35:50 - so we're gonna fix that in a second um
35:52 - and before actually let's go ahead and
35:54 - fix that right now
35:55 - so we're gonna target the product
35:57 - container
35:58 - but we are going to say target the image
36:01 - inside the product container
36:02 - give it a max site of 200 pixels a width
36:05 - of 100
36:07 - object fit contain and a margin bottom
36:10 - of 15
36:11 - pixels okay so i'm going to go ahead and
36:13 - do that
36:14 - and then you can see what this will do
36:16 - is it will actually restrain the image
36:18 - so that it doesn't
36:19 - look crazy big like we saw it before
36:22 - okay
36:23 - now um i thought mohamed elfin says you
36:26 - good
36:27 - yeah we're good dude we're good so now
36:29 - we're going to go ahead and add a
36:30 - background color
36:31 - of white so let's go ahead and add a
36:32 - background color white and then we need
36:35 - to do a few things so a z index of one
36:37 - should allow this to pop up over the top
36:39 - but there's a few things that we need to
36:41 - do in order to get that color to pop
36:42 - and the first things we need to do is
36:44 - actually go ahead and add a few
36:45 - different rules in so
36:47 - we added this these things we have the
36:50 - flex direction and we're going to add in
36:51 - the following here so
36:53 - what i just pasted in was this i added
36:55 - align item center
36:56 - go ahead and save justify content flex
36:59 - and
37:00 - margin 10 pixels padding 20 pixels width
37:03 - 100
37:04 - max height 400 pixels min width over 100
37:07 - you guys can go ahead and
37:08 - just copy that and it's going to be
37:10 - completely fine you can break down those
37:12 - values if you want to
37:13 - and sort of digest that as you feel free
37:16 - but what this is going to do is actually
37:18 - going to go ahead and
37:19 - space it out as required and to do so so
37:23 - now we have that and for the price
37:26 - what i'm going to go ahead and do so
37:28 - we've got the
37:30 - product info here so for the product
37:32 - info
37:33 - i'm going to set the height to 100
37:35 - pixels
37:36 - let's go over here and jump down
37:39 - height to 100 pixels margin bottom of 15
37:42 - pixels
37:43 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
37:45 - the
37:47 - price should have so the price should
37:49 - have a margin top
37:50 - of five pixels you can see it's starting
37:52 - to come together a little bit okay
37:54 - starting to come
37:55 - somewhat together the button itself i'm
37:57 - going to go ahead and target so i'm
37:58 - going to go ahead and target that button
38:00 - and say you see guys that that snippet
38:03 - of code did all the difference there so
38:05 - you see we have a normal button here
38:07 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
38:08 - going to go ahead and paste in this
38:10 - snippet and i just want you guys to copy
38:11 - this one because it's completely the
38:13 - styles that you need
38:14 - this is the amazon color the background
38:15 - color for amazon now you've got the
38:18 - border one pixel solid right here
38:20 - and it adds a little very very subtle
38:22 - border but it adds a nice little border
38:24 - in there
38:24 - so over here and then you've got the
38:27 - margin top so it slightly pushed it
38:29 - from the top component a little bit
38:31 - we've got a margin top of 10 pixels
38:33 - and a border color and we have a nice
38:35 - little gradient border because it's very
38:37 - subtle but these things make all the
38:38 - difference right
38:39 - and we have some i think it's just some
38:41 - black text okay so it's just some very
38:43 - very simple stuff okay so very black uh
38:46 - just black text and then i'm just gonna
38:48 - double check because i'm a bit paranoid
38:50 - that i haven't actually got the right
38:51 - style here so i'm just gonna be
38:52 - sure there we go yep so everything's
38:54 - good
38:55 - so that is the product okay so we have
38:58 - the product
38:59 - right here and what we're going to do
39:01 - next is
39:02 - we are going to go ahead and go to the
39:06 - go to home and for each of these
39:09 - products
39:10 - right so we have this product right here
39:12 - but for each of these products let me go
39:14 - ahead and go over to home.js so where my
39:17 - home.js and we still have over 1500
39:21 - people watching so you guys are awesome
39:23 - let's keep this energy high guys so
39:27 - here now what i'm going to say is i'm
39:29 - going to go ahead and target the home
39:31 - container okay so let me go back to your
39:34 - home
39:34 - css and i'm going to do a few rules here
39:37 - and i just want you guys to follow along
39:39 - and you can break this down as you feel
39:40 - free afterwards so the first thing is
39:43 - the surrounding container is the home
39:44 - container
39:45 - for this i'm going to say display flex
39:47 - right so display flex
39:49 - now i'm going to say justify content
39:51 - center then i'm going to say margin left
39:53 - margin right of auto and a max width of
39:55 - 1500
39:56 - pixels now the reason why this is
39:58 - important
39:59 - is because what this does is what we
40:01 - just did here
40:02 - is let's go ahead and make this full
40:04 - screen you see we actually
40:06 - limit so if it ever goes past a certain
40:08 - screen size
40:09 - it's not going to just keeps like
40:11 - stretching everything
40:13 - to stupid ridiculous lens it's going to
40:16 - actually stop it
40:17 - so now it's very very fluid right so we
40:20 - actually got a lovely donation by jay
40:21 - courtney thomas thank you so much dude
40:24 - we massively appreciate that i'm just
40:25 - going to pull up on the screen right now
40:28 - he says your work is amazing guys i am a
40:30 - paga
40:31 - low code developer but this has really
40:33 - got me back into
40:34 - proper coding exactly the guys that is
40:37 - some british
40:38 - slang being dropped right there proper
40:40 - coding that's what we're talking about
40:41 - this is some fun stuff guys and we have
40:43 - a whole week
40:44 - of this content so if you're excited let
40:47 - us know
40:48 - that's awesome dude thank you so much so
40:51 - yeah we added
40:52 - that little piece of code in which
40:53 - protects us against that max with issue
40:56 - the next thing we are going to go ahead
40:57 - and do so we're going to go back to our
40:59 - code
40:59 - is we're going to go ahead and target
41:01 - that row okay
41:03 - so here i'm going to say the home row so
41:06 - i'm going to target the
41:08 - so if we go into our home component you
41:10 - can see everything sits inside of our
41:11 - home row
41:12 - let's go back into home.css and we can
41:14 - say display flex a set index of one
41:17 - margin that five pixels margin right
41:18 - five pixels save the file
41:20 - and boom so you see that's actually a
41:23 - magic piece of code where that kicks in
41:25 - because what that did is that actually
41:28 - allowed us to then go ahead and it will
41:30 - use up the entire space that it needs to
41:31 - use up
41:32 - and it does all of the things it needs
41:34 - to do
41:36 - but the product itself so
41:39 - the home products we've got home let's
41:42 - go ahead and go inside of here
41:45 - we've got the actual let me go ahead and
41:48 - find this one second guys we've got the
41:50 - home
41:51 - the product itself
41:54 - product info let's go ahead and just
41:57 - want to double check this
41:58 - so imagine now what if we what we do is
42:00 - if we had two products
42:02 - so let's go ahead and go to home let's
42:04 - render two products inside of here
42:06 - and you can see there we go guys so it's
42:08 - actually using up
42:10 - the correct amount of space that we
42:12 - expected to be using up right
42:14 - but you can see this text is actually
42:15 - getting pushed around and we don't
42:17 - actually want that
42:18 - we want it to kind of use up or left
42:21 - align
42:22 - that top container so that is the
42:25 - product info
42:26 - so that most likely means we need to go
42:28 - ahead and target the product info
42:30 - uh correctly so i think what we could do
42:32 - here is we could do text align either
42:33 - left
42:34 - we could either do that nope that hasn't
42:36 - done it or we can actually go back to
42:38 - our product
42:39 - and then we just double check i'm
42:40 - probably missing a piece of code right
42:42 - here but what we can do guys i'm going
42:43 - to show you a little debugging trick
42:45 - so if we go ahead right click inspect
42:47 - and what i can do is i can actually go
42:49 - ahead and check
42:49 - on this component so i can see the
42:51 - product info over here
42:53 - and what i can say is i can say a width
42:54 - of 100 let's go ahead and see what that
42:56 - will do hey there we go so we can see
42:58 - you can give it a width of 100
42:59 - and give it a width of whatever you want
43:01 - it to at this point
43:03 - but we're going to keep it as what
43:06 - it was for now so
43:10 - here we have two product components
43:14 - um and they're rendering out as required
43:16 - so if i go ahead and add a third look
43:17 - what happens guys
43:19 - it just does it in a very responsive way
43:21 - add a fourth
43:22 - it's gonna figure out it's gonna do that
43:24 - thing it's to make it work in the way
43:26 - that we expect it to
43:27 - so i'm going to add two in here
43:30 - and then what i'm going to go ahead and
43:32 - do is go ahead and go
43:34 - back to our product dot js
43:38 - and here we go
43:42 - so we've got the product info we've got
43:44 - the p tag i'm going to go ahead and
43:46 - change the product info here to
43:50 - i feel like i'm missing a style um
43:54 - but we will figure that one out let's go
43:56 - back to your product
43:57 - okay we're all good so we have these two
44:01 - products which is awesome
44:03 - let's go back to our home and we've got
44:06 - this too over here
44:07 - and basically i'm just going to populate
44:08 - these as we as we accept as
44:10 - as we saw it previously so we've got the
44:12 - three products down here and for this
44:14 - one
44:14 - we had let's go ahead and we had one
44:18 - product down here so now you can see
44:20 - it's somewhat along the lines right so
44:22 - it's somewhat along the lines of getting
44:24 - there
44:25 - but you see the background color is not
44:26 - exactly white okay
44:28 - so background color is not exactly white
44:30 - and that is going to be a bit of a
44:32 - problem
44:33 - okay so we want to kind of change that
44:34 - right now so what we're going to do to
44:36 - change that is we're going to go to our
44:38 - app.css or actually i think we've done
44:40 - it in index.css
44:42 - yeah we've done it in index.css let's go
44:44 - to our index.css
44:47 - and inside the body what i'm going to
44:49 - say someone say give it a background
44:50 - color
44:51 - of this right here now this is the
44:52 - amazon background it's gray
44:54 - okay so as soon as i do this can you
44:57 - guys see the difference it makes it's
44:59 - all about these subtle differences when
45:01 - it comes to
45:02 - coding in front-end development guys so
45:04 - that just by adding a gray background
45:07 - you can see it actually makes it super
45:09 - super clean
45:11 - and you have this very very nice finish
45:13 - okay so it's very very nice finish
45:15 - at the end of that when we go ahead and
45:16 - add that slight change
45:18 - now i'm going to close that one and
45:21 - let's go back
45:22 - so here now obviously the final app
45:24 - doesn't look like this right
45:26 - so i mean everything looks a bit
45:27 - different but how do we pass in
45:29 - different values to each of these
45:30 - components so in order to do that
45:33 - the way that we're going to do it is
45:37 - we're going to go inside of our header
45:39 - so i actually want to fix something
45:41 - quickly because
45:42 - right now the home row itself so
45:48 - let's go ahead and check we've got the
45:50 - home row
45:52 - i just want to check so home row max
45:54 - width width of 100
45:56 - and the image is taking up 100 yep
45:59 - we've done that okay so here we go
46:02 - so for the
46:06 - home product
46:11 - okay i guess we're good so okay so
46:14 - that's fine so we've got this right here
46:16 - we've got the home row itself
46:18 - we've got the home product and we have
46:21 - the home product p
46:22 - tag we have the operator image okay i
46:24 - guess we're good so inside of the
46:26 - product itself then what we're going to
46:27 - do is we want to basically customize
46:29 - each one of these and have it so that
46:33 - it's essentially
46:34 - going to be different for each of these
46:36 - props okay
46:37 - so different for each of these right
46:39 - here so that we're going to use props
46:40 - for that so
46:41 - i saw somebody say different code guys
46:43 - this was actually written by us
46:44 - so this is all our code um we're gonna
46:48 - go over to product and now guys what you
46:50 - can do here is you can accept something
46:51 - called props
46:52 - right now props in es6 what we can do is
46:54 - we can put these curly braces and this
46:56 - means we break apart the object that we
46:58 - pass
46:58 - in and what we're going to do here is
47:01 - i'm going to pass in something as
47:02 - follows so i'm going to say
47:04 - you have a title you have an image
47:07 - you have a price and you have a rating
47:09 - okay so let's go ahead and save it
47:11 - let's go back to home and then what
47:13 - we're going to say
47:14 - is here we have the title let's go ahead
47:17 - and say is the lean start
47:20 - so the lien start up the price let's go
47:23 - ahead and say is
47:26 - 19 let's go ahead and just exaggerate
47:28 - say 29.99
47:30 - and then we have the image now the image
47:34 - for the lean stop
47:35 - was the one that we had earlier which
47:38 - was i believe it was this one
47:41 - um so that's actually rendered really
47:43 - ugly so let's go ahead and do this
47:45 - let me save it so we've got the image
47:47 - and then we also had
47:49 - the rating and the rating what i'm going
47:51 - to say is let's just give it a five star
47:53 - rating now
47:54 - okay so four what we're going to do is
47:58 - here we are going to say so now we don't
48:01 - want to use a hard-coded value we
48:03 - actually want to use
48:04 - the one that we passed in so here i'm
48:06 - going to say use the title and what this
48:08 - is doing guys i just want to show you
48:10 - so you guys can see that
48:13 - this is the product where i called it
48:16 - right so this is where i called the
48:18 - product and i passed in a value here now
48:21 - this
48:21 - gets used so you see we destructure it
48:24 - over here okay then we actually go ahead
48:27 - and we
48:28 - use that value right here so and
48:32 - in the title so you can see this is the
48:34 - sort of way that we use props
48:36 - and actually allows us to make it
48:37 - extremely uh
48:39 - reusable and efficient this is why i
48:41 - personally love react and it's one of
48:43 - the reasons why react is taken off so
48:44 - well
48:46 - so i'm going to go ahead and create this
48:48 - again so now we have the title pulling
48:50 - in here so you can see now these ones
48:51 - aren't showing a tile because
48:53 - i've only passed props to the first one
48:55 - okay which makes sense
48:57 - so the second one we don't want it to be
49:00 - a 1999 i want this one to say
49:04 - emma uh price so this one's gonna say
49:06 - price
49:07 - save it and then here rather than doing
49:09 - one star i'm going to show you guys a
49:11 - nice little trick okay
49:13 - now the way you do this is here what
49:15 - we're going to say is oh damn dude
49:17 - we just got a huge donation that's what
49:20 - i'm talking about guys we got a 20
49:22 - donation from xero.js background to
49:24 - amazon clone you guys are amazing much
49:26 - love and respect
49:27 - great job proud of you i know you
49:29 - deserve more but i'm a student rico from
49:30 - usa
49:31 - guys that's insane we love you guys and
49:33 - i appreciate you guys
49:35 - and i can see it so it's early for some
49:37 - of you guys so that's insane
49:38 - i really think you guys who are here
49:40 - watching this early in the morning
49:42 - you're spending your time well keep
49:44 - fired up if you need to get up
49:46 - stay hydrated i'm gonna have a drink of
49:47 - water quite now because it is quite
49:48 - intense doing this
49:52 - but we have over 1600 people
49:55 - let's go ahead and keep the energy fired
49:57 - up guys
49:58 - so we have the price which is pulling in
50:01 - so now it says
50:02 - 29.99 over here but what we can do
50:05 - instead
50:06 - is we can go ahead and have these curly
50:07 - brackets and say array
50:10 - we pass in the ratings what it's doing
50:12 - is creating an empty array for the
50:14 - rating
50:15 - and we're going to say fill and we're
50:17 - going to say map
50:18 - and then here what we do is so ignore
50:22 - pretty much you don't need to know what
50:23 - this means but you do underscore i
50:26 - right you underscore i and this has to
50:28 - be in a
50:30 - parenthesis and you do an
50:33 - arrow function like so right so an arrow
50:36 - function like so
50:37 - and basically pop in a p tag
50:42 - so this you can go ahead and copy right
50:44 - you go ahead and copy this
50:46 - and now you can see that it rendered out
50:48 - three right so i actually rented out
50:50 - three different things so if i go ahead
50:51 - and do product oops i'll go ahead and do
50:55 - product dot css god damn it
50:58 - right so product.css
51:02 - i'm going to go ahead and target and
51:04 - start the product rating
51:07 - so here i'm going to say product rating
51:10 - and i'm going to go ahead and do product
51:12 - rating and here i'm just going
51:14 - in order to get those stars in the line
51:15 - i'm going to say display flex because by
51:17 - default
51:18 - when you do display flex it drops it
51:21 - into a row
51:22 - so now guys this is really cool now
51:24 - because if we go back to our home
51:26 - and we see if i change the rating to a
51:28 - three
51:30 - you can see look at that it changed to a
51:31 - three now guys if
51:33 - that's pretty cool let me know this is a
51:35 - clear demonstration of how props work so
51:36 - you got four
51:37 - and if i do five you got five stars i
51:40 - mean if we do ten i mean you're going to
51:41 - get ten stars so
51:43 - it works pretty nice okay so five there
51:45 - we go
51:46 - now what we're doing is we're going back
51:50 - to the product and for example here we
51:52 - don't want to use
51:53 - the image the hard-coded image instead
51:56 - we're going to use the image that we
51:57 - pass in
51:58 - so we can pop it in there and there we
51:59 - go so now you're seeing
52:01 - only this the ones that we pass in
52:04 - to um all these stuff that we pass in is
52:07 - actually where it gets rendered so
52:09 - that's why you see these empty ones over
52:10 - here
52:11 - now for the final one we have this
52:13 - button over here so this is add button
52:15 - we don't actually need anything else
52:17 - so that's pretty good at this point
52:19 - right we're also going to accept an id
52:21 - but we'll come back to that later
52:22 - right so for now we're not too fast as
52:24 - to accepting an id but i'm just going to
52:26 - go ahead and add that in for now
52:28 - okay so with that said now all we're
52:32 - going to do is i've actually got some
52:33 - products here so i'm going to go ahead
52:34 - and copy and paste
52:36 - these products so these are the ones
52:37 - that you guys saw earlier this is just
52:39 - pretty much a product
52:40 - and i'm just going to assume that some
52:42 - products have a unique id okay so this
52:44 - is just a random number
52:45 - it's a random number and you can hear
52:48 - you can see here it's got another one
52:50 - we've got kenwood
52:51 - and we've just got some description a
52:53 - price rating and an image
52:54 - so you guys can pause the video watch
52:56 - this and just go ahead and copy this as
52:58 - you need to
52:59 - when you need to i'm going to go ahead
53:01 - and do the same thing for these three
53:03 - products underneath
53:04 - so let's go ahead and do the same thing
53:05 - for that so
53:07 - again i'm going to go ahead and show you
53:09 - guys a full screen view of this
53:11 - so you can see it and i'm going to go
53:12 - ahead and hide our faces like that so it
53:14 - makes it easier
53:15 - so you can pause the video copy that and
53:17 - use it as
53:18 - you feel free or as you need to let's go
53:21 - ahead and
53:22 - save it and i love this dude so i can't
53:25 - actually see the names on facebook so
53:27 - i'm really really
53:28 - sorry about that but this is a really
53:30 - nice comment here thank you so much
53:31 - because i think react is super easy to
53:33 - understand especially with sunny's
53:34 - explanations
53:35 - thank you dude like thank you honestly
53:37 - that's uh really really
53:38 - i massively appreciate that really
53:40 - really awesome
53:42 - um okay so now we're gonna do is we're
53:45 - gonna go to your home
53:46 - uh let's go back over here and i'm gonna
53:50 - go and
53:51 - add a final product to this final
53:53 - product at the bottom
53:55 - is going to be this one right here
53:58 - so it says samsung there we go
54:01 - um okay lost track of my code okay we're
54:06 - good
54:06 - so now you can see guys we've got the
54:08 - lean startup we've got this
54:10 - right here the kenwood we've got the
54:11 - three things over here and then we have
54:14 - this as such right now obviously this
54:17 - one right here it actually has some more
54:19 - information so i'm going to go ahead and
54:21 - actually copy the one that i have i have
54:23 - a full product description
54:25 - where as you can see the one that i
54:28 - passed in doesn't have a full product
54:29 - description
54:30 - so we save it now you can see there we
54:32 - go so
54:34 - if you are following along and you're
54:36 - actually at this point
54:37 - let me know right now guys because this
54:40 - is
54:40 - really really awesome to be able to show
54:42 - and share this with you guys and i just
54:44 - love the fact that so many of you guys
54:46 - are watching this is water by the way so
54:48 - a lot of you guys are asking what is
54:53 - and honestly it's unreal how many people
54:56 - we have today so
54:57 - and you guys are all sticking with us
54:58 - the retention is high
55:00 - this is awesome guys let's carry on
55:04 - right so we have the home row um over
55:06 - here
55:07 - now we pretty much just actually went
55:10 - ahead and
55:11 - dominated that front page so i'm going
55:13 - to go ahead and just show you guys what
55:14 - we just built
55:15 - fairly quickly guys so we actually have
55:17 - this amazing
55:19 - front page right now right now this is
55:22 - insane like i'm
55:23 - like come on let's be real guys amongst
55:26 - all of the connection issues that we
55:27 - suffered
55:28 - everything that we faced i mean we
55:31 - actually
55:31 - conquered this and overcame and we went
55:34 - ahead and built this front page
55:36 - pretty quick in my opinion like that was
55:37 - that didn't take that long right
55:39 - so this is really really awesome really
55:42 - powerful and i think it just shows you
55:44 - how powerful react can truly be okay
55:48 - so now what we're going to do is we're
55:50 - going to build the next page
55:52 - now the next page is the basket
55:55 - so we want to build this page right so
55:58 - this page is where all of the exciting
56:00 - interesting stuff happens
56:02 - right so now because we have all this
56:05 - basket removing functionality
56:07 - it's very dynamic it's very optimized
56:09 - and it can do a lot of stuff
56:11 - okay so what we're going to do now is
56:13 - we're going to in order to have two
56:15 - pages in a website
56:16 - you need something called react router
56:19 - okay
56:19 - now what react router does is it allows
56:21 - you so notice how on this website
56:25 - when i'm actually see if we notice the
56:28 - top url
56:29 - when i click the basket it says forward
56:31 - slash checkout
56:32 - okay so i'm not sure if you guys can see
56:35 - that
56:37 - but i'm pointing towards this part over
56:41 - here
56:41 - so it says forces checkout okay
56:45 - now um when i click the back
56:48 - you see when i click the amazon logo it
56:50 - goes to the home page and when i click
56:51 - this it goes to four says checkout
56:52 - in order to get that functionality we
56:54 - just need to introduce something called
56:56 - react rule
56:57 - and guys just wanted you guys to know
56:58 - that i see a lot of you guys asking do i
57:00 - need to finish it by a certain time
57:03 - no honestly all of the homework all of
57:05 - this stuff
57:07 - here as long as you guys are able to
57:09 - deliver
57:10 - before the end of the challenge that is
57:14 - amazing guys i mean that's all you need
57:16 - to do to be a part of the
57:17 - prize draw but guys if you go ahead and
57:20 - follow all of this stuff
57:22 - then you're going to get the serious
57:23 - value in and you're actually going to be
57:25 - able to land jobs from this stuff so
57:26 - make sure you go ahead and do that stuff
57:28 - so let's go ahead and jump back into the
57:30 - code
57:33 - so here what we need is app.js and
57:36 - let's go ahead and do the following so
57:39 - now we are going to go ahead and
57:40 - introduce react router so
57:42 - in order to introduce react rear we need
57:44 - to go ahead and install
57:45 - react root dom so let's pull up our
57:48 - terminal with command j
57:49 - i'm going to go ahead and add another
57:50 - terminal so we have this right here
57:52 - make sure you're cd into the correct
57:54 - directory
57:55 - and i'm going to do mpmi for install so
57:59 - npm install
58:00 - react rear dom so you guys just want to
58:02 - do the same command
58:03 - and that will go ahead and get you to
58:07 - the correct uh and that will go ahead
58:09 - and install react rear dom
58:10 - for yourself right now i just saw
58:12 - somebody says why is he repeating the
58:14 - same project this is not the same
58:15 - project we have
58:16 - full payment processing in this project
58:18 - on days two and three
58:20 - so stay tuned guys um
58:24 - okay so until in order to implement this
58:26 - what we do now is we pretty much wrap
58:27 - our app
58:28 - so we need to import a bunch of things
58:30 - at the top so you guys can go ahead and
58:31 - do the same thing you can import this
58:33 - from the top
58:34 - and then what we are going to do is we
58:36 - are going to go over to
58:37 - the return and we're going to wrap
58:39 - everything inside of a router
58:41 - okay so i'm going to go ahead and wrap
58:43 - the literally wrap the entire app inside
58:45 - of something called a router
58:48 - like so there we go okay now
58:53 - what you need to do is once that's up
58:55 - and done then
58:56 - what we are going to do is now right now
58:59 - we just render the header and the home
59:01 - regardless right we want to render it
59:04 - based on
59:04 - the route that we're in okay so what
59:07 - we're going to do is we're going to say
59:08 - switch
59:11 - right now switch and programming is
59:12 - usually when you have different cases or
59:14 - sort of statements
59:15 - right so what i'm going to do is i'll
59:16 - pop everything inside of here
59:19 - and then what i'm going to say is you
59:22 - define
59:23 - specific routes so the first room i'm
59:25 - going to define is when we're at the
59:26 - home page
59:28 - so this is how you do it you say let's
59:30 - go ahead and get rid of this
59:31 - so when i'm at this route render the
59:34 - header and the home
59:36 - component okay so if i do that now so
59:38 - you see i'm at the
59:39 - forward slash route and by default it
59:41 - falls back to this if i go to abc
59:44 - this will always get hit if it doesn't
59:46 - match anything so
59:47 - this is always your default route so
59:49 - this is what we call the home page room
59:51 - so right now you can see at the home
59:54 - page room it's very very clear and very
59:56 - very good
59:57 - okay and it works as we need it but what
60:00 - if we want the checkout page root
60:01 - how do we implement that so i'm going to
60:03 - go ahead and copy the same snippet but
60:05 - i'm going to say checkout now just to
60:07 - exaggerate this
60:09 - what we do is on the checkout page we're
60:10 - not going to have a home component we're
60:12 - going to say instead
60:13 - a huge h1 which is i am a checkout
60:19 - smash the like button
60:22 - save and let's see if this works and if
60:24 - it does work
60:25 - i mean listen to the code right so let's
60:27 - go ahead and go to the forward slash
60:29 - checkout
60:31 - and boom i'm a checkout smash that like
60:34 - button
60:34 - if you're enjoying this content i
60:36 - thought that was smooth
60:38 - af if qazi was here right now dude i
60:41 - think he'll be proud of that one
60:42 - that was a um yeah i mean it's just a
60:44 - bit of fun guys
60:45 - yeah but you guys can see that that is
60:48 - essentially how we use react rio okay
60:50 - so you can see at the top we pretty much
60:53 - have it says
60:56 - force checkout okay so let's go ahead
60:58 - and
60:59 - get rid of that and it goes to the
61:00 - homepage you see that all right
61:03 - so that's going to be super super easy
61:06 - okay so like to implement you see that's
61:07 - how we did it
61:08 - and now you can add as many routes as
61:10 - you want but make sure your default
61:11 - route is at the bottom
61:12 - otherwise it never gets listened to and
61:14 - it gets picked up okay
61:15 - and that's going to be a problem
61:18 - so with that said now what we're going
61:20 - to do is we're going to create the
61:21 - checkout component so
61:23 - instead of this i am a checkout smash
61:24 - the like button now what we're going to
61:26 - do
61:26 - is we are going to do or somebody said
61:28 - shoot that horn
61:30 - you know what let's shoot that damn horn
61:35 - damn dude does it like it's louder than
61:37 - i thought for my head right so now what
61:39 - is going to create the checkout
61:41 - component okay so here we're going to go
61:43 - ahead and create the checkout
61:45 - component now it's going to freak out
61:48 - it's going to freak out because we
61:48 - haven't built that component so as soon
61:50 - as i click save
61:51 - so yeah whoa whoa well you don't have a
61:53 - checkout component
61:54 - so let's go ahead and
61:57 - do checkout.js also i just saw something
62:00 - interesting from someone
62:02 - i will bring this up in a sec but we're
62:03 - going to create checkout on the rfce
62:06 - and then here we're going to do our
62:07 - standard bem setup so we're going to say
62:09 - class name
62:13 - check out and say import
62:18 - import
62:24 - check out css save the file
62:27 - and there we go okay there we go um
62:31 - save oh god what's happening here dude
62:34 - okay save and then if i do h1
62:38 - smash the like button right so now it
62:40 - doesn't work
62:41 - oh it's working there we go all right so
62:43 - if i go back to home
62:45 - uh no sorry not home if i go back to
62:47 - app.js so let's go back to
62:49 - oh i actually need to create that
62:50 - checkout the css so check out
62:53 - css like so there we go okay so if i go
62:57 - ahead and create this
62:59 - and then we have this and let's go back
63:00 - to app.js
63:02 - and now guys you see where it was
63:03 - freaking out you can go to the end press
63:05 - ctrl spacebar
63:06 - and it says auto import so that will
63:08 - actually go ahead and drop this in for
63:09 - us
63:10 - save the file and we're back okay now
63:13 - this is a really good point you see we
63:14 - use header in both of these things
63:17 - so what we can do here
63:21 - if it's used in both we want to render
63:23 - it regardless of what
63:24 - we're in now we can basically go ahead
63:27 - and chuck this
63:28 - outside of the
63:31 - switch right so we can say render the
63:33 - header regardless
63:35 - and then based on the route render the
63:37 - checkout or the home
63:39 - so if i go ahead and save it you see
63:40 - nothing change but the header always
63:42 - gets rendered
63:43 - i'll go forward let's check out hey
63:46 - look at that you heard the page smash
63:48 - the like button damn it dude that's
63:49 - number two i think that was pretty
63:51 - smooth
63:51 - right now we have so you see that's
63:54 - actually a really good point though
63:55 - because somebody
63:56 - went ahead and dropped this in the chat
63:57 - and i think it's a really really good
63:58 - point to emphasize on
64:00 - if you have the uh header being repeated
64:03 - you can actually
64:04 - go ahead and pop it outside if you need
64:06 - to and that will go ahead and save you a
64:08 - lot of hassle and effort okay
64:10 - so that's going to save you a bunch of
64:11 - headache so
64:14 - let's go ahead and create the checkout
64:16 - page okay so the checkout page
64:19 - what i'm gonna do now is go and ahead
64:22 - and
64:23 - we have two sections of the checkout
64:25 - page we have the
64:26 - checkout left right so let's go over
64:28 - here and let's add something to our
64:29 - basket
64:32 - we have the checkout left and we'll
64:33 - check out right okay
64:35 - so check out left and check out right so
64:37 - check out left when i say that i'm
64:38 - referring to this
64:41 - and when i'm referring to the right side
64:43 - i'm referring to this
64:45 - okay so that's exactly what we want to
64:48 - do
64:51 - so now here i'm going to say div
64:54 - div check out underscore underscore left
64:57 - like so
64:58 - we still have 16 000 people got um you
65:01 - know uh
65:01 - 1600 people sorry it's amazing guys you
65:05 - guys are incredible
65:06 - like i can't believe the energy and
65:08 - commitment from you guys
65:09 - honestly it's so so powerful and it's
65:12 - motivating as hell for me so that is
65:14 - it's amazing to see you guys are still
65:16 - here
65:16 - all right let's go back to the image tag
65:18 - so let's go ahead and do our image
65:20 - and here i'm going to say that this has
65:22 - a class name
65:24 - of image sorry checkout ad okay so this
65:27 - is going to be checkout ad
65:30 - now for the source what i'm going to do
65:32 - is i'm going to go ahead and drop in the
65:34 - amazon link okay so
65:35 - inside of here what i'm going to do is
65:37 - drop in the amazon link
65:39 - so this is a this is actually this
65:41 - banner right here so this is a banner
65:44 - obviously this is too big right now
65:47 - so let's go ahead and make that a bit
65:49 - smaller so what i'm going to do is go to
65:51 - checkout.css
65:53 - and go ahead and target this and say for
65:55 - that ad
65:56 - go ahead and make the width 100 and the
65:58 - margin bottom so underneath it
66:00 - a margin of 10 pixels okay so let's go
66:03 - ahead and do that
66:04 - and that's going to make that a little
66:05 - bit cleaner and then
66:08 - going back to our code let's go back to
66:11 - checkout.js
66:13 - and then we're going to go ahead and do
66:18 - um so underneath now what we're going to
66:20 - say is we're going to have a div
66:22 - and this div is going to have
66:25 - so underneath we're going to say div and
66:27 - this div
66:28 - is going to have a h2 which is going to
66:31 - have a check it's going to be h2 and
66:32 - it's going to have check
66:33 - out underscore underscore title and this
66:36 - is going to say your shopping basket
66:38 - okay your shopping basket save it you
66:41 - can see it says your shopping basket
66:43 - and then we are going to have all of the
66:45 - products that you have inside your
66:47 - basket get rendered out okay
66:49 - so this sort of stuff is going to happen
66:51 - now
66:52 - i'll explain how we do that in a sec but
66:55 - let's focus on the
66:56 - right hand side of the screen for now so
67:00 - let's go ahead and jump on the right
67:01 - hand side of the screen
67:03 - um so let's go ahead and do
67:06 - this right here so div dot
67:09 - checkout i'm just going to just go right
67:13 - like this okay now in here we're going
67:16 - to render the subtotal
67:17 - okay so this is going to be part of your
67:19 - homework the subtotal but we have a lot
67:20 - of stuff to do before then
67:21 - um and thank you dude somebody said
67:23 - never thought uh react real is so easy
67:26 - sonny it was amazing explaining that
67:27 - thank you guys
67:28 - uh that is that means a lot when i see
67:30 - stuff like that it's very motivating and
67:32 - it pushes you to do more so
67:33 - check out right so you can see this
67:35 - stuff over here on the right we're going
67:37 - to go ahead and build that on that side
67:38 - of the screen
67:40 - so that's going to be a subtotal
67:41 - component so right now i'm just going to
67:43 - say
67:44 - i'm just going to put h2 here saying the
67:47 - oops
67:48 - h2 saying the subtotal go here we'll go
67:51 - here save that and you can see the
67:53 - subject so you see right now it doesn't
67:55 - look like
67:56 - like how we expect it to be looking so
67:58 - inside of checkout
68:00 - what i'm going to go ahead and do is
68:02 - actually go ahead and say
68:05 - the following i'm going to say checkout
68:07 - display flex padding of 20 pixels
68:09 - background color of white
68:11 - and a height of max content and the
68:13 - reason why this has happened
68:15 - is because remember we had that left and
68:17 - right
68:18 - the right has this um the subtotal where
68:21 - the subtotal will go here
68:22 - and the left had the image and the rest
68:25 - of the stuff so the h2s shopping basket
68:28 - and so forth
68:29 - now underneath the checkout the goal
68:31 - here
68:32 - is to have all of the baskets uh all of
68:34 - the basket items
68:36 - so here i'm going to have a basket item
68:38 - being rendered out
68:39 - and then so forth loads of them like
68:41 - that and that is basically going to be
68:42 - resembled
68:44 - in the fact of what we see here so just
68:46 - as we see it here
68:47 - is basically how we expect to go ahead
68:50 - and see it
68:51 - in our code okay but we're a few steps
68:54 - away from getting to that point just yet
68:55 - so um what we're gonna do next
68:59 - is actually go ahead and target the
69:02 - checkout title okay
69:04 - so the checkout title we are going to go
69:06 - ahead and give that
69:08 - the following code we're going to say
69:09 - that is a margin right of 10 pixels
69:12 - and that has padding 10 pixels and a
69:14 - border bottom of one pixel solid like
69:16 - grey
69:17 - let's go ahead and add that in so you
69:19 - see that actually added in this nice
69:20 - little line
69:21 - so if i go ahead and comment this out
69:22 - for a sec come back bring it back you
69:25 - see
69:25 - pops in that nice little line okay now
69:29 - i love this comment i've seen this a few
69:31 - times it says i'm amazed guys i'm
69:32 - watching this like a movie
69:34 - and you know what guys i'm actually kind
69:36 - of jealous because like
69:37 - i wish i wish i wish i wish when we were
69:40 - learning when i was learning coding that
69:42 - we had this kind of content
69:44 - uh because it just it's just like i find
69:46 - it the best way to learn
69:48 - let me know what you guys think i mean i
69:49 - always find the practical stuff where
69:52 - you can actually go ahead and get your
69:53 - hands into
69:54 - the nitty-gritty that is going to allow
69:56 - you to go ahead and
69:57 - absolutely crush it so there we have the
70:00 - shopping master okay
70:01 - so now guys what we want to do is
70:04 - we have this um also i want to be able
70:08 - to be able to click this
70:09 - link so you see i want to click this
70:11 - amazon link
70:12 - and actually take me back to the home
70:15 - page so what we can do here is we can go
70:16 - to our header component
70:18 - and i'm going to show you guys how easy
70:20 - it is we're using react rear just to go
70:22 - ahead and do that
70:23 - so this is the image for the logo
70:27 - so this is the header logo and what we
70:29 - need to do here
70:31 - is simply do a link and you see it says
70:34 - auto import from react to router dom so
70:36 - this is the import statement that you
70:37 - need
70:38 - but all you need to do is do a link and
70:40 - put the image inside of this link okay
70:44 - and i'm going to go ahead and say
70:46 - specify a to property
70:48 - and this is going to be go back to the
70:50 - home page okay
70:52 - so now you can see it's become a
70:54 - clickable link so as soon as i click it
70:56 - boom we go back to the home page that's
70:58 - awesome that's slick
71:00 - and that was easy to implement guys yeah
71:02 - so you see that are super easy to
71:04 - implement and what i'm going to show you
71:05 - is also
71:06 - another very easy thing to do and
71:09 - that lies over here so let's go ahead
71:12 - and well i want it to happen at the
71:14 - basket as well so when i click this
71:16 - basket
71:16 - it takes us to that basket page so as
71:19 - you guys might guess it
71:20 - we go here we type in link like so
71:25 - and we surround everything inside of it
71:27 - so let's go ahead and dash everything
71:29 - inside of it
71:30 - let's go ahead and do this link two and
71:32 - let's do four slash
71:34 - checkout save it and now guys if i click
71:37 - this
71:38 - boom it takes me to check out doom fix
71:40 - this
71:41 - everything works right now
71:45 - um somebody says the website has no ssl
71:47 - when we deployed to firebase it will
71:49 - have ssl
71:49 - so yeah you can you can
71:53 - recheck that one dude because it does it
71:55 - will have ssl um
71:56 - yeah but you can pretty much see now we
71:58 - have the shopping basket and the amazon
72:00 - and guys the beautiful thing is there's
72:01 - no refresh all right so there's no
72:04 - refresh
72:05 - it's super super quick and that's why we
72:07 - love reactor
72:08 - inside of react okay so carrying on
72:11 - strong
72:12 - still over 1500 people love and
72:14 - appreciate you guys
72:15 - uh this energy is insane right now um
72:18 - let's keep on going guys so
72:22 - so let's go ahead and now what we're
72:25 - going to do is we're going to go to our
72:26 - shopping basket and now i guess the next
72:27 - step naturally guys
72:29 - is what we're going to do is i'm first
72:31 - i'm going to create the subtotal
72:32 - component
72:33 - okay so the subtotal component let's
72:35 - firstly go ahead and do that because
72:36 - that will make our life a little bit
72:37 - easier for the homework
72:39 - let's go to our checkout component
72:44 - and let's see here so we have the
72:47 - subtotal we'll go ahead so let's go
72:49 - ahead
72:49 - and make a subtotal component so here
72:52 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to say
72:55 - sub total like so
72:57 - okay get rid of this save and let's go
73:00 - back
73:02 - let's do subtotal subtotal.js
73:06 - rfce and let's go ahead and pop that out
73:10 - and then what i'm going to do is for
73:12 - this class i'm going to give it a class
73:14 - name of subtotal
73:16 - save the file go back up here and say
73:18 - import
73:20 - subtotal dot css save the file pull it
73:23 - back
73:24 - and let's go ahead and code this up so
73:27 - what i'm going to use is actually a
73:29 - really nice
73:32 - called react currency format so in order
73:35 - to install this
73:36 - it's very simple guys all you need to do
73:38 - is go ahead and go open up your terminal
73:40 - so command j is my little shortcut do
73:42 - npm i
73:44 - do react currency format this will go
73:46 - ahead and import
73:48 - um let's go ahead and import the
73:51 - uh module into our platform into our
73:54 - project and it will
73:56 - it will allow us to use it and the
73:58 - reason why i love this guys is because
73:59 - it allows you to
74:00 - really easily actually go ahead and show
74:04 - money okay so it's may sound sleep it
74:06 - shows you
74:07 - rendering money is always the simplest
74:09 - thing okay so this is going to make it
74:11 - super easy to go ahead and do that
74:15 - okay so what we're going to do now is
74:17 - and if you guys are interested in
74:19 - getting exciting
74:20 - uh getting excited because we are going
74:22 - to be covering
74:23 - react context api so if you guys have
74:25 - been wanting to know about
74:26 - react or redux then let me
74:30 - know in the comment section right now
74:33 - because redux is on fire and i'm going
74:35 - to show you guys
74:36 - how to go ahead and learn all of that
74:39 - beautiful stuff
74:40 - with the react context api okay so get
74:43 - excited for that let me know in the
74:44 - comment section
74:45 - and it's completely fine if you are
74:46 - behind guys you can take your time you
74:48 - can watch us back
74:49 - you can pause the video you can spend 6
74:51 - 7 10 hours 50 hours doesn't matter
74:54 - just spend your time afterwards and you
74:55 - can go ahead and do this afterwards okay
74:58 - so um let's go back to subtotal okay so
75:01 - now
75:02 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
75:03 - ahead and import it at the top of the
75:04 - file so let's go ahead and import
75:06 - the currency format from react currency
75:08 - format like so
75:10 - and now what we're going to do is here
75:13 - guys
75:14 - i'm going to copy a big snippet and i'm
75:16 - going to explain
75:17 - what we're doing here okay so i want you
75:19 - guys to do the same thing i want you to
75:21 - copy this snippet
75:22 - and then break it down okay because it
75:24 - can be a lot to digest a lot to swallow
75:27 - so let's go back over to uh okay i'm
75:30 - gonna say
75:31 - here's zero items there we go
75:34 - okay and then here i'm also gonna say
75:38 - zero okay now
75:42 - let's go to our checkout page let's
75:45 - render our subtotal
75:46 - by doing auto import which imports it at
75:49 - the top of the page
75:49 - save it and what we can see now is it
75:52 - says get
75:52 - okay so let's go ahead and actually fix
75:55 - some of this so this
75:56 - right now let's say a value of zero
75:59 - and this also is freaking out because it
76:02 - says cannot resolve subtotal.css so
76:04 - let's go ahead and make that file
76:06 - subtotal.css save it i see so many
76:09 - people asking about folder structures
76:11 - guys
76:11 - don't worry about the folder structures
76:13 - just get the content down
76:15 - and that is going to be much more
76:16 - important than having fancy folders okay
76:19 - so
76:19 - screw all that stuff focus on the actual
76:22 - learning
76:22 - and everything behind it okay so
76:26 - right so you saw that worked and you can
76:29 - see we have this subtotal over here on
76:31 - the right hand side so we want to get
76:33 - that looking like
76:34 - that okay we want it to look like this
76:36 - okay
76:37 - so how do we get it look like that let's
76:39 - go and style this thing so let's go back
76:41 - to our subtotal.js
76:43 - and here it's where let's quickly
76:44 - explain a few of these things so
76:46 - we'll come to render text in a second
76:48 - but here we're saying decimal scale of
76:49 - two
76:50 - so go to your t two decimal places so
76:52 - like for example here two decimal places
76:55 - the value so this is the currency this
76:57 - is the amount getting passed in here
76:59 - so this is going to be part of your
77:00 - homework guys so this is going to be
77:03 - part
77:03 - of the homework all right i want you
77:06 - guys to try and figure this one out
77:08 - see how you guys can implement that
77:10 - display type is text
77:11 - we can leave that thousand separate so
77:13 - if you've got like six thousand pounds
77:15 - or something let's go ahead and add like
77:17 - a silly number of like expensive
77:19 - products here so let's go ahead and add
77:20 - like a few ipads
77:22 - and then you can see at the top it says
77:24 - 4 000 because we've added this styles
77:26 - and separated true
77:27 - the prefix here is not going to be
77:29 - pounds we're going to use dollars
77:30 - because you know most of the team
77:31 - uses dollars so let's go ahead and stick
77:33 - with dollars um
77:36 - and then what we are going to have is
77:38 - the
77:40 - render text so this is what actually
77:42 - comes
77:43 - out of the text right so this is what
77:45 - actually gets rendered onto the screen
77:47 - so at this point we can ignore the value
77:48 - here but this is the crucial part so it
77:51 - focus on the p
77:52 - tag and the small tag the p tag is
77:54 - essentially where we say subtotal
77:57 - the number of items and the value okay
78:00 - so here this is the value
78:03 - that we actually get past we pass in
78:05 - here so it's actually going to be used
78:07 - as a prop here so this is also a part of
78:09 - the homework
78:10 - all right so this is part of the
78:11 - homework right so pay attention to the
78:13 - homework guys because it's going to be
78:15 - juicy
78:16 - okay and i want you guys to do well in
78:18 - this homework and it's going to be a
78:19 - nice little challenge actually for you
78:20 - guys
78:22 - and you can see the homework is dynamic
78:24 - so as i remove items from the basket
78:26 - as i remove things it updates the number
78:29 - of items
78:30 - and it updates the price okay so it does
78:32 - all of that stuff and it updates
78:34 - everything
78:35 - okay so we have this over here we have
78:38 - the small tag okay
78:40 - now this is just an input type because
78:41 - it says the order contains the check
78:43 - order contains a gift obviously ours
78:45 - doesn't look like this right now so i'm
78:46 - going to go ahead and style it
78:48 - and then we can move on okay so the
78:49 - first thing i'm going to do right now
78:51 - is go to oops i'm going to go to
78:55 - we've got the checkout we've got the sub
78:58 - tool and then here so
79:00 - after this we're going to have a proceed
79:02 - to checkout button okay
79:03 - so and this is going to be a react
79:05 - router um and this is gonna have sorry
79:08 - it's gonna be a button which says
79:09 - proceed to check out
79:11 - uh so so let's go ahead and drop this in
79:15 - underneath so here proceed to check out
79:18 - okay now let's go ahead and make this um
79:24 - let's go ahead and make this an absolute
79:28 - beautiful looking subtotal form let's go
79:30 - to our subtool
79:33 - and what we're going to do is we're
79:34 - going to add in the following rules so
79:36 - i'm going to explain every single one of
79:37 - these
79:38 - in a sec so we're doing display flex
79:40 - flex direction column
79:42 - yeah justify content space between
79:45 - width of 300 pixels high of 100 pixels
79:47 - padding 20 pixels which can give it a
79:49 - bit more space around it
79:50 - background color of it's going to be
79:53 - like a white i think it's like an off
79:54 - gray
79:55 - okay then you've got a border with a
79:58 - nice little color behind it and a border
79:59 - radius which is
80:00 - slightly rounded okay so there you go as
80:03 - soon as i save that look at the
80:04 - difference it made
80:06 - like just by making that slight little
80:08 - change
80:10 - we get a beautiful looking um
80:13 - we have a beautiful looking ui already
80:16 - right
80:17 - so let's go ahead and let's target the
80:20 - gift
80:21 - next so let's go to subtotal.js and
80:24 - here we have the subtotal gift so we
80:27 - had it here so i'm going to go ahead and
80:28 - target that subtotal gift i'm going to
80:29 - say
80:30 - display flex and align items in the
80:32 - center because you see
80:34 - right now it's kind of very subtle but
80:37 - it's actually
80:38 - off so you see right now where i'm
80:39 - pointing it's actually slightly off okay
80:41 - so we're gonna go ahead and fix that so
80:44 - let's go back to subtotals.js
80:47 - and i'm going to go ahead and do
80:50 - back to css sorry go ahead and do
80:54 - this okay so this is awesome let's click
80:57 - save
80:58 - and then you can see it it went and
81:00 - aligned it centrally
81:01 - now i'm going to go ahead and target the
81:04 - input field i'm going to say give it a
81:05 - margin right
81:06 - five pixels so it slightly pushed it
81:08 - away and then i want to get the amazon
81:10 - button styling
81:11 - down so it looks like the amazon button
81:14 - and hey zombies as clean as sunny's
81:16 - hairstyle thank you dude
81:18 - um so subtle and we're going to target
81:20 - the button inside i'm going to say
81:21 - background
81:22 - of this beautiful amazon orange and
81:25 - we're going to say back
81:26 - border radius right here and we're also
81:28 - going to say a width of 100 pixels a
81:31 - height of 30 pixels
81:33 - and then we are going to say um
81:36 - border margin top border color and
81:38 - remember that's just like uh
81:40 - gradient that we've shown previously and
81:42 - the color is the black text so as soon
81:43 - as i hit save
81:44 - guys as soon as i hit save if this looks
81:46 - amazing smash that thumbs up button if
81:48 - you really haven't
81:49 - because guys if we're all part of this
81:51 - community let's help
81:52 - share this knowledge to as many people
81:54 - as we possibly can
81:56 - save it and look how clean that ui is
82:00 - like i mean it's i
82:01 - always like even as an experienced
82:03 - developer sometimes like you come back
82:04 - to these moments where you're like
82:06 - damn like subtle changes make the entire
82:09 - thing look different
82:10 - like it it completely changes your
82:11 - perspective on this stuff so
82:13 - looks really really clean now with that
82:17 - said guys
82:18 - we are going to actually go ahead and i
82:20 - saw a question asking about react
82:22 - brewing and history object yes we will
82:23 - be doing that
82:24 - stay tuned for days two and three and
82:26 - we're going to cover plenty of that
82:26 - stuff now guys
82:28 - i want to get to the juicy stuff okay
82:31 - so just want to take a second here so i
82:34 - know it's been
82:34 - quite an intense build so far but this
82:37 - is where it gets
82:38 - a little bit intense and we're basically
82:40 - going to crush this next bit
82:41 - so if you need to stand up stretch out
82:45 - have some like you know take a few
82:47 - breaths just give yourself a little bit
82:48 - of a break
82:49 - right have some water i'm gonna have a
82:51 - quick break
82:54 - and let's crush the next
82:58 - section which is the react context
83:01 - api okay we're gonna kill this section
83:04 - today
83:05 - because this is gonna be the big
83:08 - juicy part of this build and once we get
83:11 - through this part
83:12 - it's gonna allow us to have this amazing
83:15 - functionality to go ahead and add and
83:17 - remove items
83:18 - from our basket okay so you can go ahead
83:20 - and add items to the basket so let's go
83:22 - ahead and see we can add items to the
83:24 - basket
83:24 - we can remove items and we can do loads
83:26 - of stuff as such okay
83:29 - so this is going to be awesome and this
83:31 - is going to be
83:32 - part of today's um implementation okay
83:36 - so what i think actually is actually
83:39 - yeah okay let's go ahead and do it okay
83:40 - so what we have now is the react
83:44 - context api now we have all of our apps
83:47 - right here okay now whenever i add
83:50 - something to the basket i essentially
83:51 - need a data layer to push some
83:53 - to push that item into the basket so
83:55 - let's pull out the whiteboard
83:57 - okay so i don't know if you guys can
83:58 - actually see me i need to go ahead and
84:00 - share my screen
84:00 - let's go ahead and pull out the
84:02 - whiteboard okay
84:04 - so let's imagine we have a few
84:06 - components so let's go ahead
84:08 - we've got the header okay we've got the
84:10 - header we've got the
84:11 - body okay so this is the header of the
84:14 - app and this is the body
84:16 - and then here are the products right so
84:19 - this is one product this is another
84:21 - product
84:22 - this is another product okay and this is
84:24 - a fourth product so we've got four
84:26 - products in a row
84:27 - right now each one has an add to basket
84:29 - button okay
84:30 - so this is like an add to basketball and
84:32 - add to basketball and add to basket
84:33 - button
84:34 - and so forth okay then we have our
84:36 - little nice
84:38 - basket icon at the top okay so i don't
84:40 - know this is like a little basket okay
84:42 - so what i'm saying now is here what
84:45 - we're going to have is essentially
84:47 - an add to basket button okay
84:50 - so it's going to be an add to basket
84:51 - button and basically what we want to do
84:53 - is
84:54 - we want it so when i click this button
84:57 - we're essentially going to push
84:58 - oops we're essentially going to push an
85:01 - item
85:02 - into let's just call it the data layer
85:05 - okay
85:06 - so let's call this the data layer the
85:09 - data layer and what i'm referring to
85:11 - here
85:11 - is actually the react context
85:14 - api okay or it's similar to the redux
85:18 - pattern so many of you may have heard of
85:20 - redux or wanted to learn redux
85:21 - so basically anytime i press any of
85:23 - these buttons it's going to push
85:26 - the item that the button belongs to
85:29 - into the data right now why is this so
85:32 - powerful
85:33 - it's because once it lives in this data
85:36 - layer
85:36 - what we can do is we can essentially go
85:38 - ahead and just
85:40 - put it into any component that we need
85:43 - we can go ahead and pull it into
85:44 - the basket we can go ahead and pull it
85:46 - into the
85:47 - uh into this component for example we
85:50 - can pull it wherever we need it okay
85:52 - so this is going to be crucial for your
85:54 - homework and this is going to be crucial
85:56 - for example
85:57 - once we push the item into the data then
85:59 - for example when we go into the
86:01 - my basket page or checkout page we can
86:03 - see what items are inside the data there
86:05 - so this is going to be
86:06 - why we need the reactor there so let's
86:09 - go ahead and actually
86:11 - go ahead i just want to see i just got a
86:13 - message um
86:14 - on skype one second maybe because he's
86:17 - actually rejoining us guys
86:21 - so what we're going to do now
86:24 - is we're actually going to go ahead and
86:27 - add
86:28 - the uh prerequisites for
86:31 - the context api so now guys what we're
86:34 - going to do is we're gonna create the
86:36 - state provider so here are a few steps
86:39 - which i recommend
86:40 - you don't stress over too much okay just
86:42 - follow my steps
86:44 - follow what we need to do and you will
86:46 - get things working in the way they need
86:48 - to work okay and once we get to that
86:49 - point
86:50 - you can understand how they work
86:52 - afterwards just follow what i'm doing
86:54 - right now
86:54 - and everything will work super smooth
86:56 - okay
86:57 - [Music]
86:58 - so now what we're going to do is we're
87:01 - going to go to
87:02 - state provider so let's go ahead and add
87:04 - state providers let's go ahead and do
87:06 - state
87:07 - provider.js dot js
87:10 - and you guys can pretty much copy what
87:11 - i'm about to write here okay
87:13 - so here i'm going to copy out a snippet
87:16 - now this snippet right here
87:18 - pretty much it's just a few different
87:19 - import statements okay
87:21 - so this is a few different import
87:23 - statements um
87:26 - that we have right here and then we have
87:28 - this is essentially
87:29 - creating the data so this basically
87:31 - prepares to say prepares
87:32 - the data there okay we'll make this a
87:35 - little bit bigger prepares the data
87:38 - layer so we're going to prepare the data
87:39 - there and here
87:41 - we basically have um one second
87:48 - so here we have the essentially the
87:52 - preparation of the dialogue and then
87:53 - here guys we don't need to essentially
87:55 - know what this
87:56 - does like but what but i'll explain this
87:58 - in in a different video
88:00 - or maybe in the comments afterwards but
88:02 - all this is essentially doing is
88:04 - basically
88:04 - this will wrap our app okay this will
88:07 - this what we have right here is
88:09 - basically setting everything up
88:10 - and it's going to wrap our app and
88:12 - provide the data layer
88:14 - to every component inside of our app
88:16 - that's it okay that's all it's doing
88:18 - so we don't need to know about all this
88:19 - fancy stuff all you can do at this point
88:21 - is just copy this out okay
88:22 - just copy it out that's all we need to
88:24 - know and this is how we're actually
88:27 - going to be able to pull
88:28 - information right right so pull
88:31 - information
88:32 - from the data layer now i can see some
88:35 - people asking like should we actually go
88:37 - ahead
88:38 - and copy and paste and things like that
88:40 - guys trust me
88:41 - when i say this i've taught so many
88:43 - students me and kazi everyone else has
88:45 - taught
88:45 - students like trust me it's all about
88:48 - pattern recognition
88:49 - do not be freaked out by the stuff okay
88:52 - i want you guys to copy this out and you
88:55 - can actually go ahead and
88:56 - focus on how we use this and then
88:59 - the sort of implementation this stuff
89:01 - won't be as important okay
89:03 - so we're going to click save and now
89:05 - what we're going to do is we're going to
89:07 - go over
89:08 - to our index.js and here what we're
89:11 - going to do
89:12 - is we are going to go ahead and wrap our
89:14 - component okay so we're going to wrap
89:16 - our component in something called the
89:19 - state provider so i'm going to say state
89:20 - provider
89:21 - and we're basically going to go ahead
89:23 - and close this
89:25 - like so and it's going to freak out
89:26 - because we don't have these two things
89:27 - we don't have the initial state
89:29 - and we don't have this weird thing
89:31 - called the reducer
89:33 - okay and um this is a really good
89:36 - comment by hajira she says
89:39 - so that every comment a component can
89:41 - get access to the data layer yes
89:43 - so this is why we actually want
89:46 - the um this is why we want a data so
89:49 - that every single component can have
89:50 - access to that data which means that if
89:52 - we push information in
89:54 - then we can basically go ahead and pull
89:56 - information out
89:57 - wherever we are inside of our app okay
90:00 - so this is why we actually need to go
90:02 - ahead and use that
90:05 - so with that said we have that pretty
90:07 - much working
90:08 - um but we need to have these two things
90:10 - the initial state is what does the data
90:11 - look like daily look like in the
90:13 - beginning
90:13 - and the reducer is how we sort of
90:15 - manipulate with the data how do we play
90:17 - with the data
90:18 - so what we need to do now is create
90:20 - something called a reducer so let's go
90:22 - ahead and create reducer.js now
90:25 - don't worry about what reducer means as
90:28 - such
90:28 - um it's just think of it as the data
90:31 - layer
90:31 - right so in this case what we need to do
90:34 - is create the initial state right so
90:37 - we're going to have a user at some point
90:39 - but for now we're going to leave it
90:40 - blank but initially in the data layer
90:42 - we're going to start with a empty basket
90:45 - okay
90:45 - so we're going to have an empty basket
90:47 - to begin with and then what we're going
90:49 - to do guys is we're going to create
90:51 - a something called a reducer okay so
90:53 - this initial state remember we saw this
90:55 - earlier
90:56 - we actually used it here so i can go
90:58 - ahead and import this
90:59 - into and we've actually go ahead and
91:01 - we've fixed the first part so the second
91:03 - part is actually getting this reducer
91:04 - now what is a reducer
91:07 - right so a reducer is essentially when
91:09 - we have this
91:10 - data layer right so when we have this
91:12 - data that we spoke about earlier
91:15 - a reducer is essentially how we are able
91:18 - to you see this arrow right here how are
91:21 - we
91:22 - able to actually dispatch this action
91:24 - into the data layer
91:26 - okay so when i click and add to basket
91:28 - button so when i click a button like
91:30 - this
91:30 - how does it then go and dispatch the
91:33 - action into the data layer
91:34 - and how do i actually go ahead and pull
91:36 - it
91:38 - right so the pulling part is easy but
91:39 - pushing into it
91:41 - is where the reducer plays a very
91:43 - important part
91:44 - okay so here when we click add to basket
91:47 - we essentially all we need to know
91:49 - is what product we're actually adding to
91:51 - the basket and we're going to shoot it
91:52 - up into the data
91:53 - and it's pretty much going to sit inside
91:55 - there there up here okay
91:56 - so let's go ahead and head back to our
91:58 - code and what we're going to do now
92:01 - is and i love this joshua thomas still
92:04 - says he is still
92:05 - pumped right that's the energy that
92:06 - we're talking about guys
92:08 - right so what we're going to do is we're
92:10 - going to go back to our reducer
92:12 - and here what we are going to say so
92:15 - the context api and redux are not the
92:17 - same thing
92:19 - but they are the same pattern okay so
92:21 - both use this
92:23 - idea of a store like um a
92:26 - basically a global store for your
92:28 - application
92:29 - and then you basically have this pattern
92:31 - of dispatching actions
92:33 - into this store and the reducer just
92:35 - listens and says okay
92:36 - you just updated a basket all right i
92:38 - know what to do okay
92:40 - you just removed the knife from the
92:41 - basket i know what to do don't worry
92:42 - like that's what the reducer is doing
92:44 - okay
92:45 - so at this point in order to write the
92:46 - reducer we need to do the following
92:49 - so we need to say const reducer and it
92:52 - takes two things it takes a state
92:54 - and that's the state of the application
92:56 - and then it says
92:57 - the action okay now the action is what
92:59 - are you trying to do are you trying to
93:00 - add to the basket you're trying to
93:01 - remove from the basket what are you
93:03 - trying to do here okay
93:04 - so here what i'm gonna say is
93:07 - it takes a switch right now the switch
93:10 - is based on the action
93:12 - dot type now i will explain this and
93:14 - everything will
93:16 - make sense with practice so do not freak
93:18 - out guys okay
93:19 - so here we're going to say case and i'm
93:21 - going to say add
93:22 - to basket okay add to basket
93:26 - like this and then here i'm going to say
93:29 - return
93:29 - right now this basically means whenever
93:32 - we receive and add to basket action so
93:34 - remember we talked about this earlier
93:36 - so um oh damn it i've lost that snippet
93:40 - okay nevermind remember we spoke about
93:41 - when we sort of would press the add to
93:43 - basket button so
93:45 - every time i would press the add to
93:46 - basket button it would dispatch
93:48 - an action with this type add to basket
93:52 - okay
93:52 - now when we so the reducer imagine the
93:56 - reducer is just something that's always
93:58 - listening
93:59 - for for a dispatch or something like
94:00 - that it's always just listening okay
94:03 - and what we're going to do here is we're
94:04 - going to say return and what we're doing
94:06 - is we're returning whatever the state
94:07 - originally was
94:09 - but we're going to change the basket and
94:11 - we're going to say the basket should now
94:13 - be
94:14 - whatever the basket currently was so
94:16 - whatever it currently was
94:18 - plus whatever we actually decided to add
94:21 - so the action
94:23 - dot item that you passed inside of the
94:26 - action okay
94:27 - so this will make a lot of sense shortly
94:29 - okay
94:30 - um
94:34 - um okay so so now
94:38 - what we are going to do is we are going
94:40 - to go ahead and actually
94:42 - export the reducer so we are going to go
94:44 - ahead and export the reducer and we also
94:46 - want to have something called a default
94:47 - state okay
94:49 - so default state so here i'm going to go
94:52 - ahead and say default return state
94:54 - now guys again this you don't need to
94:56 - really know exactly what this does
94:58 - but at this point we need to go ahead
94:59 - and hook it up okay so
95:01 - go up to this reducer go ahead and
95:03 - connect control spacebar auto import
95:06 - done okay so guys all you need to do is
95:08 - just copy those steps
95:10 - copy those steps and everything will be
95:11 - okay and you should get to the point
95:13 - where the state provided
95:14 - is not defined so we need to go ahead
95:16 - and import
95:17 - the state provider as such so save that
95:21 - and guys at this point if i go ahead and
95:23 - do this well now we need to connect our
95:25 - add to basket
95:26 - to basically go ahead and push something
95:28 - inside of the data layer okay so let's
95:31 - go ahead
95:31 - go to our product and now
95:35 - inside of our product when we click this
95:36 - add to basket button
95:38 - we want to dispatch and add to item add
95:41 - to basket
95:42 - object okay so let's go ahead and go to
95:45 - our product so product.js
95:47 - and what i'm going to say is when i
95:50 - click the
95:51 - button so when i unclick i'm going to
95:54 - say
95:55 - um add to basket and this is going to be
95:58 - a function
95:59 - that i'm going to write up here so i'm
96:00 - going to say const add
96:03 - to basket like this okay now this will
96:06 - take
96:07 - no arguments and all it will do is it
96:11 - dispatches
96:12 - an action okay so here we're going to
96:13 - dispatch some action
96:16 - into the data layer and basically the
96:18 - goal here is saying dispatch
96:20 - the item into the data layer so we have
96:23 - it
96:24 - okay so just copy and paste it if you
96:27 - need to do that okay
96:28 - now what we're going to do here guys is
96:30 - in order to pull
96:31 - information from the data layer i showed
96:34 - you previously in the uh when we were
96:36 - setting things up inside of the state
96:37 - provider
96:38 - that this bottom part i said you don't
96:40 - have to understand what it does
96:41 - is it's going to essentially allow you
96:44 - to pull information from the data so
96:46 - here what we're going to do is we're
96:48 - going to go ahead and say
96:50 - const basket like this
96:53 - dispatch and we're going to say use
96:55 - state value so i'm going to explain what
96:56 - this does
96:57 - and basically what we have here is we
97:00 - have the state
97:01 - and we have a dispatch okay now the
97:04 - state we're not too interested in right
97:06 - now
97:07 - so we can pretty much ignore that this
97:08 - is basically the state of the
97:10 - global store and here we have the
97:12 - dispatch okay
97:14 - so the dispatch is going to be how we
97:16 - manipulate the data so here what i'm
97:17 - going to say is dispatch and then i'm
97:20 - going to say
97:21 - dispatch an item dispatching object into
97:24 - the data layer
97:25 - so this dispatch is like a gun right so
97:28 - it essentially allows you to shoot into
97:31 - the data layer so like and shoot an
97:33 - action like we said like that arrow that
97:35 - we showed previously
97:36 - um that's what we're going to basically
97:38 - be doing here so i'm going to say type
97:40 - and here we're going to say add to
97:42 - basket
97:43 - okay and then the actual item that we're
97:46 - going to push into the data
97:48 - is going to be an item with the id
97:53 - from here it's going to be the title is
97:56 - going to be the title that we pushed in
97:58 - over at the top
97:59 - the image is going to be the image that
98:01 - we passed in as a prop
98:03 - the price is going to be
98:07 - the price that we passed in as a prop
98:09 - and also the rating
98:10 - is going to be passed in as the rating
98:12 - at the top okay
98:14 - so what this does now guys
98:18 - is we essentially are going to dispatch
98:20 - and add to basket action now
98:22 - the way that we check that this works
98:24 - okay is we open up our inspector
98:27 - we go here if i click on add to basket
98:29 - nothing shows
98:30 - okay so let's go over to our
98:33 - reducer let's go and make sure that i
98:37 - like to always do a console.log
98:39 - so let's go ahead and do console.log and
98:42 - i like to
98:42 - always dispatch the action okay
98:46 - so now if i do add to basket
98:49 - whoa we got an add to basket action it
98:52 - dispatched
98:53 - this type of action so add two baskets
98:56 - so i picked it up in this case statement
98:58 - and then it said item and
99:01 - you see what we're doing here is we
99:04 - actually went ahead
99:05 - and said so i'm just going to go ahead
99:08 - and make this a bit bigger for you guys
99:11 - so it says change the basket
99:14 - so that the basket is now whatever the
99:17 - basket currently was
99:18 - plus the action.item and the item is
99:21 - this stuff right here
99:22 - so this will push the basket
99:25 - into this will push the item into our
99:27 - basket so now we should
99:29 - have the um now we should
99:32 - have the actual item inside of our
99:34 - basket so how can we check
99:35 - very simple thing we can do we can
99:37 - pretty much go ahead and
99:38 - this is our state right here we can
99:40 - destructure and we can say
99:42 - hang on get me the basket outside of the
99:44 - state
99:45 - and all you guys gotta do is chuck a
99:47 - console log and say something like this
99:49 - you can say this
99:50 - is the basket
99:55 - and put something like this and now guys
99:58 - look what happens so you see it says
100:00 - this is the basket on many renders and
100:02 - we can go ahead and
100:02 - add to basket and whoa we had an item in
100:05 - the basket so now we have this one item
100:07 - in the basket okay
100:09 - okay that's cool i'll go ahead and add a
100:11 - second item whoa okay
100:13 - now we've got two items in the basket
100:15 - add a third
100:16 - now we've got three items in the basket
100:19 - you see
100:20 - like this is really powerful stuff and
100:21 - like we're basically all we're doing
100:23 - is we're pushing into the data layer
100:27 - all right so um
100:31 - so you can use i saw why is he using the
100:33 - function instead of
100:34 - arrow yeah you can use arrows you can
100:36 - use functions you can do those whatever
100:37 - you want guys
100:40 - but yeah you can pretty much see at this
100:42 - point you have the three
100:44 - items inside of the basket okay
100:47 - and we are almost at the finish line
100:50 - guys so stay
100:51 - with me okay we're almost at the finish
100:53 - line um for today's
100:54 - session so if you guys are pumped up and
100:57 - you are ready
100:58 - to do that last final push i know it's
101:01 - been a while
101:02 - i know it's been a while but come on
101:03 - guys there's huge prizes here
101:05 - the prize even if you didn't win is
101:08 - essentially
101:09 - getting that final job that you deserve
101:12 - okay as a developer so
101:14 - stay with me guys let's bring up the
101:16 - energy and let's put
101:17 - finish strong to that finish line okay
101:20 - so the fi what i want to do now is
101:23 - essentially
101:24 - you see at the top over here where we
101:26 - have
101:27 - this right oh god oops where we have
101:30 - here right we have the zero now
101:33 - what i want to do is when we add an item
101:36 - to that basket we want that to
101:38 - dynamically update
101:40 - i want this to dynamically update like
101:41 - this like this is the this is the actual
101:43 - app it dynamically updates right
101:45 - so this is going to be really really
101:47 - cool to actually go ahead and implement
101:50 - so we need to actually go ahead and
101:53 - implement this
101:54 - um so let's go ahead and do that
101:57 - so i love it i can see the energy coming
102:00 - up this is awesome
102:01 - right so let's go ahead and go to our
102:04 - header component
102:05 - and what we're going to do inside of our
102:07 - header component
102:08 - is we are going to go inside to the top
102:10 - of the function
102:12 - go to header.js
102:15 - and as i explained previously guys we
102:17 - can pretty much go ahead
102:18 - and do the following we can use that
102:22 - magic use date value to pull information
102:24 - this will be the state
102:27 - right so we can go ahead and import this
102:30 - so remember you need to go ahead and
102:31 - import this at the top
102:33 - and then you've got the state and you've
102:34 - got dispatch okay
102:36 - now we may not use the dispatch in this
102:38 - case we don't actually need the dispatch
102:39 - but i'm going to leave it in there to
102:40 - make it simple for you guys
102:42 - now here we have the zero
102:45 - okay so we hard coded as zero here but
102:50 - this is how easy and insane the powerful
102:54 - the react context api is what we can do
102:57 - is we can get the basket
102:59 - okay we can get the basket like so grab
103:02 - the basket and what we can do is we can
103:03 - scroll down
103:04 - go here and guys all i need to do at
103:07 - this point is say
103:08 - basket dot length
103:12 - that's it that's it guys do that and
103:14 - what i would recommend is that you put a
103:16 - question mark here and this is called
103:18 - optional
103:18 - chaining and what this would mean is
103:20 - that if you for any reason
103:22 - don't have the correct value or basket
103:24 - becomes undefined due to an error
103:26 - it won't freak out it just will
103:29 - gracefully terminate okay or gracefully
103:31 - handle the error okay so let's go ahead
103:33 - and add this now guys
103:36 - i think if we go ahead and click add to
103:40 - basket we should see
103:41 - update in the corner but you know things
103:43 - can go wrong things can go insanely
103:45 - crazy everything's not being on our
103:46 - sides i'm going to make this a bit
103:47 - bigger
103:47 - and let's just go ahead and pump up the
103:49 - crowd and let's get everyone sort of
103:51 - anticipated because i think if we've
103:53 - done this right
103:54 - boom guys there we go can you see that
103:57 - if i go ahead and click this in
103:59 - we're getting this is the number of
104:01 - items inside that basket guys
104:04 - so that is insane that is awesome it's
104:06 - working
104:07 - okay like it's working we go ahead click
104:09 - it in and we have the shopping basket
104:11 - stuff here
104:12 - so this is really really powerful okay
104:14 - this is really really powerful stuff
104:16 - now what say guys do you want to do
104:20 - so i'm going to leave this down to you
104:22 - guys i'm going to ask you guys a
104:23 - question now
104:24 - so today what we can do is i can either
104:27 - set you your homework here
104:29 - and we can build out the remainder of
104:31 - this stuff so we can build out the
104:32 - remainder of the shopping basket list

105:58 - right
105:58 - so every day if you guys want to be a
106:01 - part if you want to be
106:02 - in this to win the prize
106:05 - that we've set what we ask is that you
106:07 - go ahead and
106:08 - finish the homework and we submitted the
106:11 - homework yesterday which was the
106:12 - portfolio
106:13 - but today what we're going to be doing
106:15 - the challenge for you guys
106:17 - is quite simple okay so challenge for
106:20 - you guys is pretty simple and what we're
106:21 - going to be doing
106:22 - is we are going to focus on the
106:26 - following for today's homework okay so
106:30 - the homework for today is can you guys
106:33 - can you guys
106:34 - build so we pull in we pull in the
106:39 - dynamic information at this point
106:41 - right so i showed you guys how to go in
106:43 - and if you add to the basket it updates
106:45 - this value over here
106:47 - now can you guys get it to show the
106:49 - number of items over here
106:51 - so inside the subtotal and can you also
106:55 - go and uh actually calculate
106:58 - the price of the items inside the basket
107:02 - okay so that is your homework okay so
107:05 - i'm going to go ahead and just put a
107:06 - little snippet on the screen right now
107:08 - and i'll visually show you guys oh i
107:10 - wasn't actually sharing the screen i'm
107:11 - sorry guys
107:13 - let me go ahead and make this a little
107:14 - bit bigger right
107:17 - so let me go ahead and make this a
107:18 - little bit bigger so this is going to be
107:20 - today's homework so i'm going to go
107:22 - ahead and visually demonstrate this so
107:24 - you can see here guys i showed you guys
107:27 - how to go ahead
107:28 - and add the dynamic information over
107:31 - here so
107:32 - when you actually go ahead and add items
107:34 - to the basket it actually dynamically
107:36 - updates at the top
107:37 - right so it dynamically updates at the
107:39 - top and we can pretty much see
107:40 - this happen in front of us okay now
107:44 - what i want you guys to go ahead and do
107:46 - is actually go ahead and
107:50 - is actually go ahead and
107:53 - for homework use that solution that i
107:56 - showed you for the header
107:58 - but go ahead and do the same thing for
108:01 - the subtotal items so
108:03 - we can see the number of items that get
108:06 - pulled in
108:07 - from our basket okay and then the juicy
108:10 - part of the homework
108:11 - is can you guys then take those items
108:15 - that we have in the basket
108:17 - and actually calculate the total
108:20 - price okay calculate the total price and
108:23 - the finished
108:24 - result should be a beautiful looking
108:27 - application
108:28 - so we won't have this for today's build
108:31 - but that will be part of tomorrow okay
108:34 - but now what i want you guys to do is
108:38 - um what i want you guys to do is
108:40 - actually go ahead and get
108:41 - this working okay so basically once we
108:45 - add
108:45 - a few items to us i'm going to refresh
108:47 - and show you guys so let's say we added
108:49 - the kenwood and the lean startup go to
108:52 - our basket
108:53 - it should say two items are inside the
108:55 - basket so it should match up
108:57 - to the top right here and then it should
108:59 - also say
109:00 - the correct total that's your homework
109:03 - guys
109:03 - for today right now we are going to drop
109:06 - instructions inside the facebook group
109:09 - and also inside the slack channel right
109:12 - now i'm about to bring on nars onto the
109:14 - stream
109:15 - and he's going to talk a bit about the
109:17 - homework the processes and what we like
109:19 - to do with the homework
109:20 - and also guys one thing i want to tell
