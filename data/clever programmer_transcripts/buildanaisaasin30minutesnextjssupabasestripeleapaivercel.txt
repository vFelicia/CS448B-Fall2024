00:00 - Do you want to build apps with AI Do you
00:02 - want to build apps like Indie hackers
00:04 - like Peter levels who launched this
00:07 - photo AI head shot app and he's making
00:11 - $70,000 a month with it and so when I
00:14 - saw that on Twitter it honestly blew my
00:16 - mind and I was like you know what we got
00:18 - to build this ourselves from scratch and
00:21 - let's do it in 30 minutes and I'll show
00:23 - you how to do it we will also have
00:25 - stripe included Your stack will be super
00:28 - base we'll be using vers cell we'll be
00:30 - using for cell's blob storage which is a
00:33 - cool new beta feature that they've
00:35 - released now you might be wondering what
00:37 - is this thing why do I need to use it
00:40 - and what's the fuss all about well
00:41 - here's the thing the problem in the
00:43 - world is when you need good photos
00:45 - whether it's for Tinder for professional
00:47 - jobs Landing a job it makes a massive
00:50 - difference the photos that you have but
00:52 - in order to get a professional
00:54 - photographer you have to spend a lot of
00:56 - time trying to find them trying to book
00:58 - them and you have to spend a lot of
00:59 - money I I went and had a professional
01:01 - photography session it cost me $1,600
01:04 - for one day the photos were great but it
01:06 - was really expensive well with AI models
01:08 - what you could do is you could upload
01:11 - your own image three or four pieces of
01:13 - images that you have and boom this AI
01:17 - stuff can make you look so damn good and
01:19 - I didn't even have to
01:22 - pay that I had to pay when I actually
01:25 - worked with my photographer so that's a
01:27 - problem that we're looking to solve
01:28 - we're going to build it and solve it in
01:30 - 30 minutes if you want to follow along
01:32 - and get access to the entire app for
01:34 - free click the link in the description
01:35 - below the app is there and available for
01:38 - you all you have to do is Click you can
01:40 - hit fork and boom you have the entire
01:43 - thing and then for the the rest of this
01:44 - video I'll just walk you through so how
01:46 - you can set it up and you will have the
01:48 - entire SAS for yourself at the very end
01:50 - sounds fair all right with that said
01:53 - let's jump straight into the video all
01:55 - right so let's go ahead and start
01:57 - building this app so click on deploy
02:00 - that's going to be the first thing it's
02:02 - going to basically create a git
02:04 - repository so you can just go ahead and
02:07 - hit clone just put whatever repository
02:09 - name that you want here okay so let's go
02:12 - ahead and hit
02:14 - start now for the
02:16 - Integrations we're using superbase as
02:18 - our
02:21 - database so this is a nice versal
02:23 - integration that allows us to create the
02:26 - tables and populate them however you
02:28 - want so let's just click add this will
02:32 - allow us to just start
02:35 - it so if you're not signed in It'll ask
02:38 - you to sign
02:39 - in yeah we're already logged in so for
02:42 - me it's
02:43 - good yep install it into
02:47 - that put your project name there so
02:50 - let's just say headshots generator
02:52 - template name it whatever you want I'll
02:54 - put in my
02:56 - password and make sure you leave the
02:58 - create sample table tables would see
03:00 - data on so leave that on
03:02 - okay and then that's very important
03:05 - actually so make sure you have that done
03:06 - and then go to create project okay so
03:10 - it's completing the installation
03:11 - beautiful now you see we have some
03:13 - required environment variables like leap
03:15 - API key and leap web hook secret so
03:19 - let's go ahead and get our leap API key
03:22 - so let's go to app. tr. a let's go
03:25 - continue with Google and then let's just
03:28 - pick whichever one right log in now that
03:31 - I'm signed in you can see there's a
03:34 - bunch of templates here that you can use
03:37 - but we're here for the head shot right
03:39 - so let's go ahead and make sure we pick
03:40 - the head shots okay go ahead and Cloe
03:43 - them here's a few
03:45 - selfies and so we're going to hit
03:47 - continue on that because we want to make
03:49 - the headshots AI app right look at that
03:52 - handsome guy that was on that first page
03:54 - now we're going to go ahead and click
03:55 - get
03:56 - started okay let's go ahead and clone
03:59 - that template so that'll give you the
04:01 - entire clone and now you should be able
04:02 - to see all the steps here okay this is
04:05 - now your own
04:07 - app you don't really have to change too
04:09 - many things because everything it's a
04:11 - template so everything is pretty much
04:12 - ready to go so just let's go ahead and
04:14 - hit publish there so there we go now our
04:17 - workflow workflow is published and we
04:20 - even have the API is like ready to
04:22 - pretty much go so let's go back to the
04:25 - dashboard here you should be able to see
04:28 - my new workflow here AI headshot
04:30 - generator now let's go to our API key
04:33 - and let's go pop in our API
04:36 - key so I'm going to say my headshots app
04:39 - and we're going to copy that generated
04:41 - key to our clipboard now okay we're
04:44 - going to pop that key in there in our
04:47 - versel project we need to also add the
04:50 - web hook secret to really make sure for
04:53 - security purposes that it's good
04:56 - okay that can be any value let's just
04:59 - chop off the the LEC part or whatever
05:03 - and let's just chop off the end
05:06 - here so we just pop in the API key here
05:11 - okay it could be any value
05:15 - really yeah so just as long as you have
05:18 - some random value that's totally fine
05:20 - okay so I just literally took my API key
05:23 - and chopped it up a little bit so let's
05:25 - go ahead and click deploy so now it's
05:27 - deploying so with that said
05:31 - this should this should probably take a
05:32 - minute or so okay so if we go to super
05:36 - base here you can see that it created
05:39 - this project for
05:42 - me okay so that generated a
05:44 - template and when you click on the table
05:47 - uh editor you'll see the four tables
05:49 - that we see here okay in order to be
05:50 - able to use
05:54 - this yep so everything is looking good
05:57 - policies are looking good policies are
05:59 - set up everything is already handled for
06:01 - you
06:03 - right all you need to do at this point
06:05 - is just follow along with all of the
06:07 - steps and if you see those reds don't
06:09 - really worry this kind of part of the
06:11 - process okay boom there we go seems like
06:15 - our project is successful and already
06:18 - started like that is insane how quick
06:20 - that
06:21 - was now let's go continue to dashboard
06:25 - here let's go visit the website and take
06:28 - a look holy crap it's already deployed
06:29 - you can see the URL right there okay at
06:32 - the
06:34 - top this is the GitHub that you
06:37 - clone now we have to set up a couple of
06:40 - things to make sure it's fully working
06:42 - for us
06:44 - okay so grab that URL we're going to
06:47 - need that
06:49 - later so let's go to our GitHub
06:51 - repository
06:54 - here let's go to our get
06:58 - repository yep and let's go ahead and
07:00 - clone it so we're going to now go clone
07:02 - it locally okay so I'm going to just say
07:06 - G uh GitHub repo clone and I'm going to
07:08 - clone
07:11 - this okay and let's CD into it
07:16 - now and then we'll open it with Visual
07:19 - Studio code
07:25 - okay and we have to configure a couple
07:27 - more things at this point
07:30 - so the next thing we need to do is make
07:32 - the login work
07:39 - okay so let's go to the read me let's go
07:44 - down let's go ahead and copy that magic
07:47 - link setup that's
07:50 - there we're going to set that up with
07:52 - super
07:54 - base let's go to super base here let's
07:57 - go to
07:58 - settings
08:00 - actually I think it's an authentication
08:02 - let's go there email
08:05 - templates and let's go to magic
08:09 - link and put that here
08:13 - okay once you have that go ahead and
08:15 - click confirm hit save we're going to
08:17 - paste that
08:20 - in okay
08:23 - beautiful next thing we need to do is we
08:25 - need to set up our
08:27 - URLs so let's go back to super
08:31 - base so let me go back here that's my
08:35 - domain so we'll grab that domain and
08:37 - we'll bring that domain to super
08:41 - base and then let's add those wild
08:44 - asterisks so then it can catch any path
08:46 - that we go to right not just a specific
08:49 - path now what this should allow me to
08:53 - basically log in okay let's go back here
08:57 - and test it out now
09:01 - where did it okay it's right there cool
09:03 - so let's go here type in our email
09:06 - Mariano at trap. hit
09:10 - enter and let's see what
09:12 - happens oh I spammed it too much so I
09:15 - got to wait for a second so let's go to
09:18 - our email and
09:22 - check and there it is confirm your sign
09:25 - up
09:27 - beautiful ah we get what you getting
09:30 - error the URL was incorrect so I just
09:33 - deleted the astris Asis from there and
09:35 - that should fix it for
09:39 - now let's actually go fix that we don't
09:42 - need the asterisk asterisk actually so
09:44 - let's get rid of that let's save it and
09:46 - let's try that
09:49 - again ah so that's the where the we
09:52 - needed to have added our new URL okay so
09:55 - let's go ahead and instead of putting in
09:58 - our email there or whatever let's put in
10:00 - the
10:01 - Euro that's where we got to put this
10:04 - asterisk asterisk okay where we where it
10:06 - says add a new URL so let's do that
10:14 - now we we don't need these other ones so
10:16 - we can actually get rid of all these
10:18 - guys
10:21 - here let's delete that let's try logging
10:24 - in again and let's see if that works so
10:26 - let's go let's type in our email Mariano
10:29 - at TR leap AI now let's check our
10:32 - email and boom We Got The Magic link
10:35 - awesome let's hit log
10:37 - in and boom there we go we're actually
10:40 - logged in it was that fast super base's
10:42 - login is so dang quick that's
10:46 - awesome now you can see I'm logged in
10:49 - that works
10:51 - successfully now let's go ahead and see
10:53 - what's
10:55 - next we got the workflow
10:58 - ID
11:00 - we need we need to just set up a couple
11:02 - of more environment variables so let's
11:04 - go ahead and set them up now on versel
11:08 - this is the template that got
11:11 - created so let's go ahead and set up a
11:13 - few more environment variables
11:15 - here so here are all the super base ones
11:18 - that were made for
11:20 - me when we did the integration so we
11:22 - don't have to worry about that we have
11:24 - the leap API key and the leap web hook
11:26 - secret which is good
11:29 - so if we look at our m.l. example
11:33 - here there's a few keys that we're
11:35 - missing let's go ahead and set those up
11:37 - here so workflow ID let's set that
11:41 - up yep so I'm going to pop in my
11:42 - workflow ID
11:44 - here so if you go back to
11:47 - LEAP go you will go to go to workflows
11:50 - this is where you'll get the workflow ID
11:54 - from so let's go ahead and click edit
11:56 - workflow and then there's a little ID at
11:59 - the top there so let's copy that yep I
12:01 - just copied it and let's go and populate
12:04 - that in versell and now we're going to
12:07 - add another one what else do we need
12:09 - Let's see we need the super base URL so
12:12 - let's go ahead and set that
12:14 - up I'm going to populate them like this
12:17 - add all the keys first so then it's
12:19 - going to be a little bit easier on us to
12:22 - remember let's get the blob blob
12:26 - guy we're going to use this actually
12:28 - store the images okay in the model let's
12:32 - get a resend API this is going to allow
12:34 - us to send
12:37 - emails this is email
12:40 - service so while superbase will let you
12:44 - like kind of use their own email service
12:47 - they don't they do have a limit whereas
12:50 - recent so you want to replace it with
12:53 - resent and you can use any email
12:55 - provider we're going to be using
12:57 - resent that's just our preferred method
12:59 - of doing it okay it's easy and it's
13:02 - simple to use so let's go with
13:05 - that so all you need to do is get the
13:07 - resent API
13:10 - key and then there's the optional part
13:13 - the stripe integration but if you again
13:15 - if you want to collect payments then
13:17 - stripe is the way to
13:21 - go so if you want yeah like if you want
13:23 - to charge other people to use this right
13:25 - that's what you want to set up so we're
13:28 - going to set that up here just so you
13:30 - know what you need to do okay so we're
13:34 - going to pop all that in
13:37 - here and I'll explain this
13:40 - later we'll just po populate it right
13:44 - now let's go deployment provider here
13:47 - versel and then let's get versel URL
13:49 - here as well yep let's going to be the
13:53 - deployed
13:55 - one yep we're going to copy that URL and
13:58 - paste that in right
14:00 - there and let's go one by one here and
14:02 - add all of this
14:05 - in let's go to the project settings here
14:09 - let's go grab the project URL paste that
14:11 - in
14:15 - there let's go get the project API Keys
14:18 - now and we're going to pop that into the
14:21 - Anon key we need the service roll key so
14:25 - that should be right below that so let's
14:27 - go ahead and grab that and put that
14:31 - in now let's go get the blob read write
14:35 - token so let's go to our versel
14:39 - storage oh nice yes so versel now has
14:43 - its own storage which is really cool so
14:46 - let's go ahead and hit create that it
14:49 - was in beta before now they actually
14:51 - have it out I'm
14:54 - excited so let's just leave that name
14:56 - that's fine let's just hit create and
14:57 - continue here
15:02 - yep and you can leave that be honestly
15:04 - just hit
15:05 - connect okay there we
15:08 - go now let's go ahead connect our
15:10 - project
15:12 - here it should be already actually it's
15:14 - already connected that's nice okay
15:21 - great so basically just by following the
15:24 - steps it automatically linked it you
15:26 - should be able to see
15:27 - that so let's go back to environment
15:30 - variables now yep The Blob read WR token
15:33 - is there it added it for
15:36 - us so let's remove the blob read and WR
15:39 - token since it was already added we
15:41 - don't need it
15:45 - here and let's go ahead and resend the
15:48 - API
15:53 - key yep so the first thing that they'll
15:55 - give you is API K right so you just have
15:57 - to make an account with them it's
16:04 - free we're using recent for two separate
16:07 - things okay one is to notify you okay
16:11 - whenever somebody like does something
16:12 - with your
16:15 - training if you've set up the recent key
16:17 - you're get you're going to get an
16:20 - email this could be your users's email
16:22 - or your own email whoever's sending it
16:27 - basically
16:29 - and you could also set it up for off as
16:31 - well right so we want to notify the
16:32 - users hey your training model is ready
16:35 - go and check it out right just like your
16:36 - pizza is ready so we need to send a
16:39 - notification like hey your image
16:40 - generation model is ready you can now go
16:42 - ahead and start uploading your images
16:43 - it'll work for
16:48 - you so let's go ahead and paste that API
16:51 - key over here
16:52 - now now let's go ahead and set up the
16:55 - stripe stuff we're going to hit true on
16:57 - stripe is enabled
16:59 - okay so now let's go ahead and set up
17:03 - stripe so we'll log into our stripe
17:05 - account
17:11 - here okay all right there we go we're
17:14 - logging in just got to put in our
17:16 - six-digit
17:19 - code there we
17:25 - go
17:27 - okay
17:30 - so you just have to usually when if it's
17:32 - your first time signing up you have to
17:33 - just fill up some stuff about your
17:35 - business so even if you don't have a
17:36 - real business you can just make up some
17:38 - stuff um and you should be fine strap
17:42 - should allow you to log
17:45 - in once you do that you'll go ahead and
17:47 - see the screen
17:50 - okay now we need a stripe secret key so
17:53 - let's go ahead and grab this key
17:57 - here
18:00 - so this is our secret live key do not
18:03 - obviously share with anyone right this
18:05 - is just cuz I'm just doing it for the
18:07 - demo but I'm going to delete this
18:10 - project afterwards we're done with it
18:12 - for you make sure you keep it a secret
18:16 - okay all right next up here's what you
18:18 - want to
18:19 - do so you want to go ahead and create
18:21 - some
18:25 - products and we want to create a one
18:27 - credit product a three credit product
18:29 - and a five credits product see when have
18:32 - three products here so let's go step by
18:35 - step here so we did versel blob we did
18:39 - resend and they're optional by the way
18:42 - we're just doing it for the purposes of
18:43 - the demo to really make this app really
18:45 - good for
18:47 - you okay now we need to create a web
18:50 - hook we've already created a secret so
18:51 - let's go ahead and create a web hook
18:53 - first so let's go type up there web hook
18:56 - go to the developer web hook and we're
18:58 - going to hit add an end point
19:01 - okay now let's grab the URL of our web
19:04 - app that we have deployed the domain not
19:07 - the rest of it okay so let's pop that
19:12 - in so your yeah your hosted URL stripe
19:16 - subscription web hook and then you we we
19:19 - going to say SL strip SL subscription D
19:22 - webhook so make sure you add that into
19:24 - the URL
19:27 - there
19:30 - okay so let's just say
19:38 - billing so we need checkout session
19:41 - completed that's what we need that's
19:43 - going to be under checkout and that's
19:44 - going to be under session completed okay
19:50 - great move that let's go ahead and hit
19:52 - add
19:53 - events
19:55 - yep and go ahead and add add an
19:59 - endpoint okay let's keep going
20:03 - here so now whenever somebody's going to
20:06 - do a session complete or subscribe is
20:08 - going to hit that web hook right after
20:11 - this checkout session completed web hook
20:14 - and then we have some logic in the code
20:16 - to build that
20:18 - user and then we're going to give them
20:20 - credits
20:23 - okay so we want to get our web hook
20:25 - signing secret and we're going to pop
20:27 - that into there here
20:29 - okay now we need to go ahead and create
20:31 - our
20:32 - products so let's go check out those
20:34 - images that show us how to do that so
20:37 - here's one of our
20:40 - products this should tell you what we
20:42 - need to do
20:43 - okay I'm going to move that there so my
20:46 - life gets easier and I'm going to go
20:49 - ahead and create our first product here
20:51 - so this is going to be one credit
20:53 - product you can upload an image if you
20:56 - want we don't really need that
20:59 - right
21:01 - now 16 so description of this is going
21:04 - to be it's going to give us 16 head
21:08 - shots okay and we will charge $12 for
21:13 - this and you can change this price to
21:15 - whatever you want but this is what we're
21:16 - going to do and it'll be one time not
21:25 - recurring
21:27 - yep
21:30 - yep I think we got everything over here
21:32 - that should be good let's hit save
21:37 - product now let's go ahead and see in
21:41 - our Visual Studio code let's go to
21:43 - stripe stripe subscription
21:47 - here and let's see one credit
21:51 - yep yep let's go in the environment
21:53 - variables
21:55 - now and let's get our price ID
22:04 - where did I put this okay let's go to
22:06 - Price ID yep one
22:09 - credit and let's go do the same thing
22:11 - for the three credits and the five
22:13 - credits so I'm going to create another
22:14 - product same process let's just go look
22:16 - at the image it's going to be three
22:19 - credits it's going to be one off it's
22:22 - going to be
22:23 - $30
22:25 - okay and it's going to give us 4 head
22:28 - shots here okay CU three credits right
22:31 - so so now click into it and now we're
22:34 - going to get our price here so let's
22:36 - grab the price or so the price ID I mean
22:39 - let's go put that
22:40 - in and we just need to do it one more
22:43 - time so let's gohe five credits 16 * 5
22:46 - whatever that is make sure it's one one
22:48 - off and then we're going to pop pop in
22:50 - the price this is
22:54 - $40 so just to be clear one credit is
22:56 - one workflow run that's what a credit
22:59 - actually
23:05 - is so one credit per training
23:08 - okay now we have all the credits let's
23:10 - go ahead and get that third price ID pop
23:13 - that in here and now we're good now we
23:16 - have all our variables filled out okay
23:18 - let's hit
23:21 - save a variable name Target production
23:25 - or exists oh actually we don't need that
23:27 - one so let's get rid of that
23:34 - one okay let's see if it's already
23:36 - defined service R
23:39 - key ah I see we actually don't even need
23:42 - those those are already Define so ignore
23:45 - those yeah those were already populated
23:47 - at the start so we actually don't need
23:49 - that so you can get rid of that yeah we
23:51 - should be good to go at this point now
23:54 - we have all of our variables okay so we
23:56 - now need to just go and hit red deploy
23:59 - so basically we can then rebuild with
24:02 - those additional
24:03 - environments now if this
24:05 - succeeds that means on the top right
24:09 - there this will basically say how many
24:12 - credits I have it should say zero
24:14 - because I don't really have any right
24:16 - now I didn't purchase
24:18 - any we'll see it says Ready
24:24 - visit awesome let's hit log in
24:30 - we don't want that URL actually because
24:31 - that's the preview so let's go ahead
24:33 - let's go jump to the main one and let's
24:35 - hit refresh so it's not the preview nice
24:38 - look at that we get zero credits so the
24:41 - reason why it shows up is we have
24:43 - additional logic that basically says if
24:46 - you have the API key enabled or not it
24:48 - then shows this otherwise it doesn't so
24:51 - let's try the experience so let's try
24:52 - the Train the model I'll call it Mariano
24:56 - head shot
24:58 - so you can pick man woman unisex
25:00 - whatever you whichever one you'd like so
25:03 - upload let's go ahead and upload some
25:05 - pictures at this
25:06 - point so I'm going to go ahead upload
25:09 - some pictures here so there we go put
25:12 - some uh Mariano's pictures look at
25:14 - Mariana looks handsome
25:20 - here it should not let me do it because
25:22 - I have no credits right now so it should
25:24 - not allow me to do it boom there we go
25:26 - so it says something went wrong okay not
25:29 - enough credits so let's go ahead and
25:32 - figure that now let's go ahead click
25:33 - credits and we can see boom one credit
25:36 - three credits five
25:37 - credits this this is being pulled from
25:40 - our products we made by the way
25:43 - automatically on stripe and so when I
25:45 - click that look at that it's already
25:47 - sending us to the checkout
25:51 - page so we can go ahead and fill out our
25:53 - card information
25:55 - here so purpose of the demo I'm not
25:58 - going to do this but as you could see
26:00 - it's set up for us to be able to
26:01 - actually do this so we can purchase
26:05 - multiple credits
26:08 - here and with a certain plan if we
26:13 - want so I'm going to go ahead and cheat
26:15 - a little
26:21 - bit so we need to also set up that
26:23 - stripe pricing table I forgot to mention
26:25 - that
26:26 - actually
26:31 - so let's go ahead to our code that we
26:33 - had cloned let's go to
26:35 - our let's go command p and let's go to
26:38 - our stripe table okay now in the stripe
26:42 - table you need to put these values the
26:45 - publish
26:47 - key and let's figure out how to get
26:49 - those okay so I'll show you how to get
26:50 - those right
26:51 - now so let's go to our search bar here
26:54 - let's go to our pricing table here and
26:57 - let's go ahead and create a pricing
26:59 - table here so let's go ahead and add one
27:02 - credit let's go and add three credits
27:05 - let's add another product and then let's
27:08 - add our final product for five credits
27:12 - okay so yeah my bad I for I I must have
27:15 - missed a step from showing you guys so
27:17 - this will take care of it
27:23 - now okay so make sure you set this up
27:25 - hit continue
27:31 - and then yeah and then hit continue and
27:34 - this is the pricing table that you get
27:35 - okay now let's copy that and we're going
27:37 - to paste that pricing table in there
27:40 - okay that's what we need to do
27:46 - there so make sure you need the client
27:49 - reference ID and the
27:52 - customer so if I did
27:55 - this put the client reference and Custom
27:57 - customer email
27:59 - okay and these should be your values
28:02 - here so now we'll render the
28:06 - table and it belongs to your
28:09 - account okay so let's go ahead and demo
28:12 - that so I'll add that into my
28:14 - code so we're going to say fix pricing
28:17 - table
28:21 - okay and uh yep Dash let's just put the
28:24 - dhm here and push it okay
28:28 - now that we have pushed
28:30 - this now we should see our deployment
28:33 - here okay and it's automatically going
28:35 - to deploy to versel doesn't need to be
28:38 - set up but just double check if it
28:41 - doesn't you can always look up versell
28:43 - deploy commands and type that in
28:46 - okay so we'll wait for this deploy to
28:50 - finish once it finishes you should see
28:53 - the new pricing
28:55 - table so you don't want the values are
28:58 - there already you want to set up your
28:59 - own pricing table cuz
29:02 - before let's give it a couple more
29:04 - seconds
29:05 - here until it's
29:12 - done yeah so some styling changes happen
29:15 - because of es lint so ignore
29:17 - those but the but the main thing is the
29:19 - pricing table ID and the publishable key
29:22 - are different so those are different so
29:25 - these have to be yours okay the can't be
29:27 - like whatever you got from the project
29:30 - so it's done so let's go ahead and look
29:33 - let's go there oh look at that we got
29:35 - tables here and we we can see a training
29:37 - that is sick so let's go ahead and click
29:41 - get
29:42 - credits so now you'll see the same
29:44 - styling that you saw that we did okay on
29:47 - stripe the blue buttons that we just set
29:50 - up in Stripe Right they're different
29:51 - color than the ones we had at the start
29:54 - of the lesson you should be able to edit
29:56 - in real time
29:58 - time so if you want to see the colors
30:00 - change for example so like let's change
30:03 - this to some other color let's change it
30:05 - to Red for
30:06 - example very very dangerous terrible
30:09 - color for uiux you don't want that but
30:11 - like let's just take a
30:13 - look let's hit
30:15 - refresh damn look at that that's sick so
30:19 - now it's linked properly and stripe
30:21 - makes your life really easy right makes
30:22 - the tables for us we don't have to make
30:24 - it that's
30:26 - nice
30:29 - so so let's just um to make the demo a
30:32 - little bit faster I'm going to basically
30:34 - give myself credits I'm going to cheat
30:36 - here so I'm going to go into the credits
30:37 - row here so it created a row for me here
30:40 - with my user
30:41 - id I'm in superbase here right now
30:45 - headshot template project here right in
30:47 - tables and
30:50 - credits and now for you as a developer
30:53 - you could just do it for yourself but
30:54 - normally right if you're going through
30:57 - the strip check out it will hit the web
30:58 - hook and then it will add credits to the
31:02 - user that actually paid it right so for
31:05 - now let's just give ourselves 10 credits
31:07 - here okay cool so now we should refresh
31:10 - and at the top right boom look at that
31:12 - it says 10 credits right so I'm rich in
31:15 - this world so let's go ahead and put
31:18 - we're going to do Mariano head shots
31:19 - here let's grab some of his photos right
31:22 - here okay I don't know why I have his
31:24 - photos on my freaking computer but ask
31:26 - Mariana don't ask me
31:28 - and then uh let's go ahead and hit train
31:30 - let's see what happens it looks like
31:31 - four different people right in these
31:33 - four different photos what the
31:34 - hell
31:37 - okay so model is now queued for
31:41 - training now if I refresh you'll see
31:43 - that it's loading and it detected one
31:46 - credit actually at the top as you could
31:48 - see and now it's running my workflow
31:51 - right and to show you that my workflow
31:53 - is running let's go to my dashboard and
31:55 - if you remember we created this
31:57 - workflow and we're running it now okay
32:01 - let's go ahead and click history and we
32:03 - can see inside of our history I ran but
32:07 - it failed
32:09 - interesting this is because my accounts
32:11 - on leap I don't have enough credit to
32:14 - run this myself so I got to
32:18 - go so I want to go ahead and upgrd so
32:22 - I'm going to go ahead and choose a
32:25 - plan so training models is very costly
32:29 - right it's not completely free so you
32:32 - have to be able to actually do that so
32:33 - I'm going to go ahead and update this
32:36 - here and I'm join this $9 per month
32:40 - one guys if you want to learn this AI
32:42 - stuff like $9 is nothing right at worst
32:46 - case scenario you could cancel a month
32:47 - from now but like the skills that you
32:50 - learn from being able to do this are
32:52 - worth so much more like you might have a
32:54 - 10K pay increase or you might get a job
32:57 - or your SAS might make you know 10K 20K
33:00 - a year or you might get a job where
33:02 - you're making a bunch more money so like
33:04 - don't be cheap when it comes to
33:06 - investing in yourself that's one of the
33:07 - things from the start of my career like
33:09 - I took very seriously where I'm like if
33:11 - I have a tool I'm going to invest as
33:13 - long as it can help me and increase my
33:16 - workflow and again this is a great
33:17 - project for you to have on your
33:18 - portfolio and showcase because there are
33:20 - people right now making $80,000 a month
33:25 - like levels IO making $8,000 a month off
33:28 - of this project there's some other dude
33:29 - who has same photo AI project making
33:33 - $100,000 per month so don't be cheap use
33:37 - these to learn let's keep going so now
33:40 - you can see I'm part of the Pro Plan and
33:43 - now I have 4,000 credits here okay so
33:45 - now I should be able to run this now I
33:48 - should be able to run this training job
33:49 - so let's actually go ahead and try
33:52 - it so I'm going to go ahead train it
33:55 - again so I'm going to pick Mariano head
33:57 - shot
33:59 - here um yep and then we're going to go
34:02 - ahead hit
34:04 - Pro now with Pro so let's go ahead and
34:07 - do that so we're going to train the
34:09 - model here
34:12 - refresh and the first one will fail but
34:15 - the second one should
34:17 - pass so here's my training data with
34:20 - these
34:21 - images
34:22 - right now let's go back let's go history
34:25 - and we can see it's running
34:28 - beautiful now that I have the credits to
34:30 - run it it's
34:32 - running it's going to take a little bit
34:35 - here so I'm going to go ahead and skip
34:38 - to the end here okay and there we
34:43 - go and our head shots are now finished
34:45 - generating so now we can go and check
34:48 - back with our app so now if I refresh
34:50 - here you'll see that the status is
34:53 - finished boom look at that and now we
34:57 - can see all the head shot that are
34:59 - generated you can see how professional
35:01 - Mariana looks
35:04 - here the the images that we put in for
35:08 - Mariana are not the best images so
35:10 - that's why it didn't create like the
35:12 - best results but you can see the results
35:15 - are actually not that bad these are
35:16 - pretty solid results I mean you guys can
35:19 - use a bunch of these photos as your
35:21 - LinkedIn photos or your resume photos
35:25 - Etc and you could search charging people
35:27 - for this at this point like you have
35:29 - this thing fully
35:31 - running right so there you go so I hope
35:36 - that you guys found that valueable like
35:38 - think about it we just built a full app
35:41 - from scratch that people legit
35:45 - developers and Indie developers like
35:47 - levels.io Peter levels is using this to
35:50 - make $80,000 per month and you were just
35:53 - able to build it in the last what 30
35:55 - minutes I mean that should be
35:57 - mindblowing and tools like TR Le make
35:59 - your life so much easier so I hope you
36:02 - got value out of it if you did Smash the
36:04 - like button I love your beautiful face
36:06 - and as always I'll see you in the next
36:09 - video
36:10 - peace
