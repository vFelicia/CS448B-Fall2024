00:00 - yo what's up guys today i'm going to
00:02 - teach you and give you the blueprint
00:04 - to become a full stack software
00:06 - developer in just
00:07 - six months so my name is coach daniel
00:10 - and what i want to get into
00:12 - is the step-by-step system that i would
00:14 - do if i were to start all over
00:16 - and how i would start to become a
00:17 - programmer and become that full stack
00:19 - developer in six
00:20 - short months so guys go ahead and hit
00:22 - that like button so we could push this
00:24 - youtube video out to more and more
00:25 - people
00:26 - and make sure to subscribe and hit that
00:28 - notification bell icon
00:29 - so that whenever we drop these fire
00:31 - videos you can also get notified
00:34 - let's go ahead and jump right into it so
00:36 - one of the first things
00:37 - that i want to clear out is when people
00:39 - start thinking about how do i become a
00:41 - software developer how do i land that
00:43 - very
00:44 - first job i want you to realize that you
00:46 - don't have to go to like the big tech
00:49 - companies right off the bat you don't
00:50 - have to go to google
00:51 - microsoft facebook you can actually go
00:54 - to
00:54 - other software companies that might be
00:56 - local or smaller
00:58 - because you just need to get your foot
01:00 - into the door to start to get
01:01 - more practice as a developer to start to
01:03 - get that experience and over time you
01:05 - could build
01:06 - your career as a developer now the
01:09 - reason i'm telling you this is because
01:10 - very often
01:11 - people come to me and they're a little
01:13 - scared of these big technical
01:14 - interview questions where they have to
01:16 - solve some crazy algorithm skills
01:18 - that they tend to have in interviews for
01:20 - big tech
01:21 - but the reality is if you go to a
01:23 - smaller local company or other software
01:25 - companies
01:26 - they're going to be trying to look for a
01:28 - couple of different things
01:29 - not only are they going to try to look
01:31 - for if you know what you're talking
01:32 - about if you know how to code
01:34 - but they're also going to look for
01:35 - things such as your passion
01:37 - are you going to be a good culture fit
01:39 - do you have the ability to actually
01:41 - write clean code
01:42 - do you have fundamental problem solving
01:44 - skills
01:45 - and finally can you communicate like an
01:48 - actual human being
01:50 - so again the reason i'm telling you is
01:51 - because these are things that you can't
01:54 - probably already do and you don't have
01:56 - to worry about these crazy data
01:58 - structures
01:58 - and these crazy algorithms so let that
02:01 - be that confidence boost for you
02:03 - to start to push forward an inch closer
02:06 - to becoming the software developer
02:21 - will it take well here's the reality if
02:23 - you're really trying to make
02:25 - a career out of this how many hours a
02:27 - day would you
02:28 - not dedicate to this because by
02:30 - inverting that question you really start
02:32 - to think
02:32 - if you're trying to do this full-time if
02:35 - you're trying to solve problems by
02:36 - writing software
02:37 - if you're trying to become a developer
02:40 - that is going out there and building
02:41 - software systems for businesses and
02:44 - companies and for people
02:45 - and solving real world problems then you
02:48 - shouldn't be looking at the minimum
02:50 - amount of time that you're spending
02:51 - doing that you should be looking at the
02:53 - maximum amount of time
02:54 - that you could possibly spend doing that
02:57 - because i understand some people are in
02:58 - situations where
02:59 - maybe they have to take care of their
03:00 - family or maybe they have other
03:02 - responsibilities
03:03 - and they can't just spend eight hours a
03:05 - day coding but that's totally fine
03:07 - but you have to still try to find how
03:09 - you can maximize that time
03:11 - but also keep it in a sustainable manner
03:14 - what i mean by that is something that
03:15 - you could do
03:15 - over and over and over again so it
03:17 - becomes a habit it becomes consistent so
03:20 - to be quite honest with you and to be
03:21 - blunt
03:22 - if you're just looking to spend one hour
03:24 - a day or 30 minutes a day coding
03:26 - you're probably not gonna become a full
03:28 - stack developer in just six months
03:30 - it might take you a little bit more time
03:32 - but that's just the truth that you have
03:33 - to understand
03:34 - about your personal situation if that's
03:37 - really all you have
03:38 - then spend that hour as intentionally as
03:41 - you can
03:41 - learning as much as you can but
03:43 - understand that it might take you a
03:45 - little bit longer
03:46 - than just six to eight months on the
03:48 - other hand if you are able to spend a
03:50 - little more time
03:51 - and you could try to hit the range more
03:52 - of around three hours
03:54 - per day i know it might be a little bit
03:56 - intense for you guys but i personally
03:58 - think
03:59 - this is good enough that if you were to
04:01 - consistently do that
04:02 - for six to eight months you would be
04:05 - able to get your dream job as a full
04:06 - stack software developer so again the
04:08 - big takeaway is one
04:10 - intensity realize your current life
04:12 - situation
04:13 - and how much time you can actually put
04:15 - per day
04:16 - to becoming a software developer to
04:18 - practicing to coding to programming
04:20 - more websites and the second point is
04:22 - sustainability
04:23 - how often can you do this time and time
04:25 - and time again because the reality is
04:27 - you might have a full-time job you might
04:29 - have family you might have other
04:30 - responsibilities that you have to
04:31 - fulfill
04:32 - so how much time can you allocate to
04:34 - make sure that you could do this over a
04:36 - long period of time because eventually
04:37 - you're gonna make that career switch
04:39 - eventually you're gonna get your first
04:40 - job
04:41 - so that 40 to 50 hours of your week are
04:44 - spent programming are spent being a
04:46 - software developer
04:48 - so now that i got those two mental
04:49 - barriers for a lot of people
04:51 - out of the way let's dive right into it
04:53 - anyways guys
04:55 - to be the best software developer that
04:57 - you can become you want to make sure
04:58 - that you are continuously
05:00 - investing into your own education and
05:03 - that's why today i want to talk about
05:05 - our sponsor for this video
05:07 - skillshare so skillshare is an amazing
05:10 - place where you could go to
05:11 - and you could take courses on anything
05:13 - you want to learn especially in
05:15 - software development so you could become
05:17 - a better programmer one of the classes
05:19 - that i'm taking right now and that i
05:21 - really enjoy
05:21 - is called algorithms and data structures
05:24 - in javascript
05:25 - and that class is taught by lucasv and i
05:27 - really love it because it goes into the
05:29 - fundamentals
05:30 - of how you can leverage these data
05:32 - structure and how you could use these
05:33 - algorithms to make sure that you're
05:35 - building optimal code
05:37 - and in this way not only will you have
05:39 - basic foundational problem solving
05:41 - skills
05:42 - but you're also going to be able to
05:43 - practice and ace
05:45 - any interview that you take so make sure
05:47 - to click the link below
05:49 - because the first thousand people who do
05:51 - so and sign up
05:52 - are going to get the skillshare premium
05:55 - membership and if you do like the
05:57 - platform you can continue
05:59 - to learn and push what you're learning
06:01 - and the best part is that it's less than
06:03 - 10
06:04 - dollars a month literally if you just
06:06 - skip out on starbucks coffee
06:08 - for two days out of the entire month
06:11 - you're gonna be able to
06:12 - reinvest that money into skillshare and
06:15 - into yourself
06:16 - if i were to start from scratch the
06:18 - first things that i would focus
06:20 - on is probably the big three when it
06:22 - comes to front-end development
06:24 - which is javascript html and css
06:27 - now to be very honest with you there are
06:29 - multiple
06:30 - resources out there in the web so that
06:32 - you could start to learn these big
06:34 - three and you could start to learn the
06:35 - foundations and the fundamentals
06:37 - of front end development i would suggest
06:40 - just digging in for just a couple weeks
06:42 - because after that
06:43 - where you're actually gonna start to
06:45 - learn is from practice
06:46 - and from making real life applications
06:49 - so a quick tip could be just start to
06:52 - build out
06:53 - plain landing pages but here is the
06:55 - amazing thing and here's the other thing
06:56 - you're going to learn
06:57 - when you start to build out landing
06:58 - pages maybe you're not going to have a
07:00 - specific tutorial
07:01 - that will show you how to build a
07:02 - landing page or how to change the design
07:04 - the css
07:06 - or how to set the html but what you're
07:08 - going to be able to learn is there's
07:09 - specific features
07:10 - you're going to want to add and this is
07:13 - where you're going to have to learn
07:14 - how to become best friends with google
07:17 - because
07:17 - as a developer doesn't matter what niche
07:20 - you're in whether it's web development
07:22 - machine learning
07:23 - databases your best friend is always
07:26 - going to be google because there's
07:27 - someone out there who's probably already
07:29 - done
07:29 - what you've done and they put it up
07:31 - there on google whether it's an article
07:33 - a video and by using google as a
07:35 - resource using youtube as a resource
07:37 - just being proactive and learning how to
07:39 - bring together
07:40 - all these different things to solve your
07:42 - problem you're going to start to develop
07:45 - these fundamental problem solving skills
07:47 - that i talked about
07:48 - earlier so after you utilize the
07:50 - resources and you started to go out
07:52 - there so you could build these landing
07:53 - pages
07:54 - you simply can start to leverage google
07:56 - so that you could really start to
07:58 - bring in the ideas and the theory that
08:00 - you've learned from the classes
08:01 - into the practicality of building these
08:04 - landing pages and building these sites
08:06 - and with those three things which is
08:08 - plain vanilla javascript
08:10 - css and html you're gonna start to have
08:13 - those foundational and fundamental
08:15 - skills when it comes to front-end web
08:18 - development
08:19 - now this again depending on the
08:20 - intensity of how much time you're
08:21 - putting into it might take you about
08:23 - one to two months but here's the
08:26 - important thing
08:26 - after you build some of these portfolios
08:29 - something that i highly recommend
08:31 - is you're gonna want to start the
08:33 - application process
08:35 - now and let me tell you why i suggest
08:37 - this first of all
08:38 - people always want to push off the
08:40 - application process because they're
08:41 - thinking
08:42 - well this place has an opening that
08:44 - might kind of fit
08:46 - my skills but i kind of want to save it
08:47 - for later here's the reality
08:49 - if you look at indeed.com if you look at
08:51 - any other job boards
08:52 - all the job postings that are there this
08:54 - month are probably not going to be there
08:56 - next month because there's so many new
08:58 - jobs coming in and so many jobs getting
09:00 - filled out so if you start the process
09:02 - now
09:03 - you have some projects built up and you
09:04 - have in your portfolio you start that
09:06 - process now
09:07 - you might get some more rejections
09:09 - because maybe you're still
09:10 - on the path to learning but what's going
09:12 - to happen is you might start to land
09:14 - a couple interviews here and there and
09:17 - worst case scenario they tell you no
09:19 - but you were able to start to learn how
09:22 - the interview process
09:23 - works and you start to build those
09:25 - skills that you have to build later
09:27 - which is how do you showcase yourself
09:29 - how do you communicate yourself in the
09:30 - interview
09:31 - so that they'll want to hire you again
09:33 - if we look at some of the mission points
09:35 - that i made
09:35 - they want to make sure you know how to
09:36 - communicate they want to make sure
09:38 - you're a culture fit
09:39 - these are two things that you're gonna
09:41 - be able to show them
09:42 - during the interview process so if you
09:44 - start this early even that month
09:46 - three and month four of coding then
09:48 - you're just gonna have that advantage
09:50 - so that as time passes you have that
09:52 - extra practice
09:53 - so don't be afraid to get rejected at
09:56 - this point after you build out a couple
09:58 - projects with the big three html css and
10:00 - javascript
10:01 - go ahead and start submitting job
10:04 - applications because this
10:05 - if anything is only going to help you
10:08 - now by this time
10:09 - you might already be around months three
10:11 - to month four
10:12 - you already have a couple projects up in
10:14 - your portfolio you've already submitted
10:17 - your resume to couple places and who
10:18 - knows maybe even gotten rejected
10:20 - at this point you're well on your way to
10:23 - landing your first job
10:24 - as a full stack developer and the next
10:27 - things that i would focus on
10:28 - would be learning a framework that can
10:31 - now tie
10:32 - in front-end development such as react
10:34 - js now there's multiple ways
10:36 - that i would actually go about learning
10:38 - react js
10:39 - very similar to before i would kind of
10:42 - dive in to react js course
10:44 - i would understand a little bit more
10:45 - about it what are the components what
10:47 - are the different parts of react.js
10:49 - after that what i would do is i would
10:51 - try to build
10:52 - a website by myself but looking at
10:55 - documentation now the reason i see
10:57 - looking at documentation is because this
10:58 - is another skill set that
11:00 - as a developer you're gonna want to know
11:02 - if you understand how to look at a
11:04 - framework how to look at a language
11:06 - and learn the documentation process
11:08 - you're gonna be able to basically
11:10 - learn whatever language you need to
11:11 - learn in the future and that's important
11:13 - because
11:14 - when it comes to the world of
11:15 - programming there's never going to be
11:16 - this one language that rules them all
11:18 - that's here for the rest of our lives
11:19 - who knows there might be
11:21 - but the reality is things change so fast
11:23 - so you have to be adaptable you have to
11:25 - be flexible
11:26 - and if you understand how to read
11:27 - documentation if you can
11:29 - learn and pick up new tools and
11:31 - languages by looking at the
11:33 - documentation
11:34 - you're going to be a very versatile
11:36 - developer
11:37 - that many companies are going to want in
11:39 - their business so after taking the
11:40 - react.js course and i've gone through
11:42 - the documentation
11:43 - i would apply a similar concept to what
11:46 - i applied with a couple months before
11:47 - i would start to build projects so again
11:51 - just anywhere from three to five
11:52 - different react js applications
11:55 - if you have that experience of just
11:56 - using the framework
11:58 - using the programming languages and you
12:00 - build it over and over again
12:01 - you add in different features you're
12:03 - going to be very well versed when it
12:05 - comes to front end
12:06 - development so by this time we're
12:08 - getting very close to the end of the six
12:10 - months
12:10 - here we might already be like four to
12:12 - five months in
12:14 - but like i said if you've already
12:15 - started applying you're just gonna put
12:17 - yourself in more opportunities
12:19 - to get in front of the right company
12:20 - that's gonna give you the first entry
12:22 - level position
12:23 - and now as part of your journey you've
12:25 - already learned all the skills that you
12:27 - need to know to be able to land
12:29 - a front-end development job so the next
12:31 - thing i would focus on
12:33 - would be actually learning a little bit
12:34 - more about git and how to leverage
12:37 - version control the reason for this is
12:39 - because version control
12:41 - is literally used in every software
12:43 - project so that you can make sure that
12:44 - your code is safe and secure
12:46 - and if any breaks come in you can always
12:48 - revert back but
12:50 - just by learning the fundamentals of how
12:52 - to use git how to upload
12:54 - your code and how to have it in a place
12:56 - where you could pull it other people can
12:57 - make modifications
12:58 - it's going to allow you to integrate
13:00 - with other teams and if you understand
13:02 - those skills you're going to become
13:03 - more marketable so now that you have a
13:05 - ton of projects under your belt you
13:07 - should have three to five react.js
13:08 - projects
13:09 - you should have another three to five
13:11 - front end landing pages
13:12 - you can start to upload all these things
13:15 - to github
13:16 - or to gitlab or to any version control
13:19 - platform and now for the icing on top
13:22 - by this time you should be going to
13:24 - interviews you should already start to
13:26 - see what are the things that you need to
13:27 - work on a little bit more so you can
13:28 - land the job
13:29 - or maybe you already end up landing the
13:32 - specific job that you want
13:33 - but i would say on my journey i still
13:36 - want to learn
13:36 - one more thing and that is databases by
13:39 - taking on
13:40 - this final topic i'll now be able to
13:43 - transition from
13:44 - a front-end developer to a full stack
13:46 - developer because i'm going to
13:47 - understand more about databases
13:48 - i understand more about how the data is
13:50 - stored i'm going to learn about apis i'm
13:52 - learning about servers
13:53 - and by having this full integration i
13:56 - will be a better programmer because i
13:58 - can develop
13:59 - full stack applications end to end now
14:02 - while you're learning
14:03 - these big three what i would also focus
14:06 - on is specifically
14:07 - javascript because out of these three
14:09 - the real programming languages
14:10 - javascript while css
14:12 - and html are like markdown languages so
14:14 - with javascript in particularly
14:17 - i would try to focus on some
14:18 - fundamentals now some of these courses
14:21 - will be able to teach you these
14:22 - fundamentals others will not but what i
14:24 - mean by the fundamentals is just simple
14:26 - things such as
14:27 - other than writing out my functions my
14:29 - loops and my conditionals
14:31 - is thinking about how do i actually
14:33 - solve specific problems
14:34 - how can i actually start to manipulate
14:36 - data so that i could get the data that i
14:39 - need
14:39 - or so that i could show it in a way
14:41 - that's important to the user
14:42 - by starting to understand these
14:44 - fundamental problem solving skills i'm
14:46 - going to start to build
14:47 - my programmer mindset the programmer
14:48 - mindset is one where
14:50 - you could see a problem and you
14:52 - logically start to see how these pieces
14:54 - fit into place
14:54 - and how you can solve this problem by
14:57 - writing code
14:58 - so using javascript and practicing these
15:00 - fundamentals
15:01 - is gonna make sure that when i go off
15:03 - into the real world
15:05 - i have basic foundational problem
15:08 - solving skills
15:09 - writing code so that is my exact
15:12 - step-by-step blueprint
15:13 - that i would do if i were to start all
15:15 - over again with zero
15:17 - knowledge so if you are looking to
15:20 - become a full stack developer if you're
15:21 - looking to take the next step if you're
15:23 - serious about that
