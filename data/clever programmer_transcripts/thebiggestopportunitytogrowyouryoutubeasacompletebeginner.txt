07:45 - now i don't want to make it seem like
07:47 - it's easy it's a lot of hard work
07:50 - and it's a long process a long journey
07:52 - but i just want to ask you guys how many
07:54 - of you guys would be excited if you woke
07:56 - up
07:57 - and you just were paid 157
08:00 - dollars for like something you were
08:03 - already passionate about and just
08:05 - sharing with the world
08:06 - and you woke up another day and you had
08:08 - a check come in 471
08:10 - and then the other day 218 would that be

08:17 - easy thing that you can do overnight
08:19 - i'll also show you the hard work that's
08:20 - required
08:21 - but i just want to get a sense of like
08:23 - does it actually excite you because if
08:25 - it doesn't
08:26 - you're not gonna like want to do a lot
08:27 - of things
08:29 - so joey's excited about it raul
08:33 - charity cooper awesome so
08:36 - let me show you guys like what it
08:38 - actually looks like in reality okay so
08:42 - you guys are seeing all the wins but if
08:43 - i go lifetime
08:45 - i'm showing you guys my highlights of
08:47 - what's happening here
08:48 - that's what you guys were looking at all
08:50 - right here's what
08:52 - nobody [ __ ] looks at or knows about
08:56 - this right here that
09:01 - what was happening here guys can
09:03 - somebody tell me in the chat
09:05 - what was going on at that point
09:08 - and by the way guys this is day one of
09:10 - the youtube challenge
09:12 - if you want to participate in this
09:14 - youtube challenge
09:15 - make sure that you have signed up for
09:18 - the facebook group
09:19 - and make sure that you have like sent a
09:21 - text where it asks you all right
09:23 - so make sure you're in the facebook
09:25 - group it's in the description below if
09:27 - you're watching this on youtube right
09:28 - now
09:30 - so here nothing is happening right joey
09:33 - just said nothing is happening there's
09:34 - nothing going on right here
09:36 - all right this is what you have to get
09:39 - through
09:40 - to actually make it about something that
09:43 - where people will start viewing you
09:45 - where people will actually start
09:46 - following you where people will actually
09:48 - start believing in you it's actually
09:50 - like a really long
09:52 - journey to get to here the problem with
09:56 - most people that happens is
09:57 - they have the expectation of this so
10:00 - they literally start with this in mind
10:03 - you're never gonna make it through this
10:06 - right if you're um if your
10:09 - eyesights are set on this thing it's
10:12 - kind of like going to work out and every
10:14 - day just being angry like why
10:16 - do i not have a [ __ ] six pack like
10:18 - every single day
10:19 - you get done working out you look in the
10:21 - mirror and you're like you suck you
10:22 - don't have a six pack
10:24 - so it's just as crazy as that you gotta
10:27 - actually set your sights on this and
10:29 - how many of you guys would like that you
10:32 - get to share something you're passionate
10:34 - about
10:34 - and you get to make a living out of it
10:38 - show of hands drop it in the comments
10:40 - how many
10:41 - right and also i want to ask you you
10:44 - don't need to make
10:45 - millions of dollars right how much would
10:48 - you want to be able to make
10:50 - to be able to like would you be happy if
10:52 - just step one
10:53 - you could make a living out of it like
10:55 - make a living out of sharing what you
10:57 - know on youtube
10:58 - so whether you are into cooking and
11:00 - you're sharing tips about cooking
11:01 - whether you're into professional comedy
11:04 - and you're sharing comedy
11:05 - or you're into being a developer and you
11:08 - want to just share
11:09 - things about coding or whatever journey
11:12 - that you're on
11:13 - would it be cool to be able to make a
11:15 - living out of it or some side income out
11:17 - of it
11:18 - right so that's something else i want
11:20 - you to think about and i also want you
11:22 - to think about is this something you
11:23 - want to just pursue as a hobby
11:25 - or is this something like if you were
11:27 - getting results you
11:28 - would really seriously commit to because
11:30 - i think like if you want to go on this
11:32 - journey those things are good to think
11:34 - about
11:34 - ahead of time so you kind of know what
11:36 - you're getting into
11:39 - uh joey says all of them for me
11:41 - jeannette says yes olivia says yes yes
11:43 - yes ricardo says
11:45 - even as a side job i would be happy
11:48 - that is awesome let me see where the
11:51 - comments are because i used to be able
11:52 - to pop up comments
11:55 - all right here we go nice so we have
11:58 - stephen and steven is like
11:59 - yes beautiful
12:03 - all right um and guys if you try to do
12:06 - the texting and it doesn't work that's
12:07 - okay don't worry about it too much
12:09 - but like make sure you actually at least
12:11 - give it a try all right cool
12:13 - now let me actually zoom in on this
12:16 - period where nothing was happening okay
12:18 - so let me go here and let me talk to you
12:22 - about
12:22 - so let's go to i'll i'll uh go to
12:26 - 2016 is where i got started right take a
12:29 - look at this
12:31 - march through november okay or let's
12:35 - just say march through
12:36 - october alright do you guys see how
12:39 - march through october
12:42 - look at the amount of views i'm getting
12:43 - i'll click first of all i made 10
12:47 - and look at my views march through
12:50 - october
12:54 - think about this i got no more than ten
12:57 - dollars
12:58 - and i was getting maybe two views four
13:00 - views
13:01 - eight views 16 views 12 views
13:04 - march october is almost 10 months
13:08 - i got my first breakthrough in december
13:11 - so that's actually like 10
13:13 - months long right now in reality
13:17 - i also wasn't producing much content so
13:20 - if you guys see here
13:21 - i only made two videos here right and
13:24 - then i only made like one video here
13:26 - in 2016. you guys see that but then like
13:29 - this is where i
13:30 - actually took it seriously in august and
13:32 - once i took it seriously
13:34 - and started making videos it started
13:36 - actually taking off faster
13:39 - yep joey says that's basically means
13:41 - that's the thing joey like
13:43 - everybody goes through that part of the
13:45 - journey
13:46 - so don't feel alone in that um
13:49 - that is like completely and totally part
13:52 - of the journey to actually getting to
13:53 - where you want to get to because
13:56 - it feels completely stagnant but then if
13:58 - i
13:59 - fast forward that to let's just say
14:02 - i'll fast forward this to 2017
14:05 - and we'll just go to the month of like
14:07 - january right
14:09 - and watch what happens boom you guys see
14:12 - that
14:13 - i get my big breakthrough in like
14:16 - around december right and this is where
14:19 - it starts to like take off
14:21 - and we get 11 000 subscribers boom
14:24 - and now it's like taking off
14:27 - um i don't even have the option for
14:29 - monetization
14:31 - yep match sources what happened in
14:32 - august lots more video production
14:34 - yes so a lot of video production
14:36 - happened around august and october
14:38 - because that's when i decided to just go
14:39 - okay now
14:40 - i'm gonna take it seriously and i was i
14:43 - found a way to start producing a lot of
14:44 - videos and
14:47 - where i built my channel right like this
14:50 - that you guys see this this this hustle
14:53 - right here this was built in
14:57 - a one hour window
15:00 - okay so i used to go to
15:03 - um i would go to work i would go to my
15:06 - college and i had full-time call like i
15:09 - would
15:10 - go to college i'd come back and then i
15:12 - would go and do bunch of part-time jobs
15:13 - so whether i was teaching coding to
15:15 - people or i was teaching like chess to
15:17 - people and i would drive and i would do
15:19 - a lot of freelancing work
15:20 - i would come home i would leave home at
15:22 - 6 00 a.m and i would come home at 9 00
15:24 - p.m
15:25 - okay so i had like really long days
15:29 - and um i would take the train in chicago
15:31 - and it would be like freezing cold
15:34 - and within that i would
15:37 - when i would come back home but i only
15:39 - had a window of one hour
15:41 - between 9 00 p.m to 10 p.m that was like
15:44 - my one hour window
15:45 - in that one hour window i would
15:49 - i essentially grew my channel that's
15:52 - where i would make the videos
15:54 - so every time i got home i had one hour
15:57 - and then i would just
15:58 - get to work and a lot of people are like
16:00 - so what does that mean like were you
16:02 - coming up with the idea in that one hour
16:03 - two no for me
16:05 - i was using the chemistry class at
16:07 - college
16:09 - and in that chemistry class i would
16:10 - actually come up with the video ideas so
16:13 - in that chemistry class i'd be sitting
16:15 - there and i'd be like
16:17 - you know if i go to youtube and we
16:19 - switch
16:20 - to your channel and let's go here videos
16:23 - and let me sort by
16:27 - oldest right and this is where i would
16:30 - come with my video ideas i would be like
16:32 - oh i'll make
16:33 - tutorial part two and then i'm like all
16:35 - right i'll make a fibonacci video
16:37 - because i learned fibonacci i'll make
16:39 - tutorial part three
16:40 - and as i was learning coding this is the
16:43 - important part i want you guys to
16:44 - understand as i was learning coding i
16:45 - wasn't that good at coding yet
16:47 - as i was learning it i was teaching it
16:51 - on youtube does that make sense as i was
16:54 - learning it like even this
16:56 - like look at this video i never thought
16:58 - for it to get
16:59 - 50 000 views it's literally [ __ ]
17:01 - called coursera r programming week two
17:03 - assignment
17:04 - one look at the name of this
17:07 - non-usable values r programming
17:10 - week two assignment one pollutant mean
17:13 - walk through part one
17:14 - you guys think that i made this video
17:16 - for it to blow up on youtube
17:18 - like just honestly like answer this
17:19 - question
17:22 - i made this video for just one student
17:25 - who i was working with
17:26 - at the time and i wanted to help him
17:28 - like there's
17:29 - really basic stuff here right i'm like
17:31 - writing a for loop but it helped a lot
17:32 - of people
17:33 - even a phd student andrew jones is like
17:36 - yo i'm a phd student trying to get my
17:38 - head around
17:39 - r this is a great resource i learned
17:40 - something and then boom shared it
17:42 - so for you guys it doesn't matter
17:45 - whether it's for
17:46 - coding or it's for complete something
17:47 - completely different if you learn
17:49 - something
17:50 - you can just share it uh and here's a
17:52 - really crazy thing that's happening
17:54 - right i actually helped my brother
17:56 - jump on youtube and i just helped start
18:00 - like start uh start the channel with him
18:02 - and look at this he started if i go
18:05 - to oldest he started literally one year
18:08 - ago
18:09 - right and he started talking about he's
18:10 - like nobody's gonna listen to me talk
18:12 - about
18:12 - colors and color grading and all that
18:14 - stuff started talking about a year ago
18:17 - and boom look at that he's made 132
18:20 - 000 subscribers and with a lot of hard
18:23 - work and effort and energy
18:25 - he cleared over 1 million dollars in the
18:28 - last 12 months
18:29 - so those are some crazy results
18:32 - but this is kind of just to share with
18:33 - you like what is possible
18:36 - and if you actually follow these steps
18:37 - it's really really possible i think for
18:40 - everyone who's gonna put in that effort
18:42 - right
18:43 - uh with that said the disclaimer i will
18:45 - make is kind of like
18:47 - lebron james right like and gary vee
18:49 - talks about this and i love it
18:50 - he goes everybody who touches the
18:52 - basketball like but doesn't mean you you
18:55 - you're gonna be lebron james so there's
18:57 - definitely some talent at play
19:00 - but even with that said there's nothing
19:02 - that you can't learn
19:04 - my brother had a background in doing
19:08 - video
19:09 - me i had a background in doing nothing
19:12 - all my brother taught me is like this
19:13 - is how you open final cut pro and that
19:16 - was as far as my training went and i was
19:17 - like
19:18 - got it and then i just got to work and
19:20 - made like 490 videos with that
19:22 - so it's really like up to you how far
19:25 - you want to take it i don't have any
19:26 - professional education
19:28 - i'm a college dropout i didn't go to
19:30 - film school
19:33 - so yeah um
19:37 - and you can grow your channel about many
19:39 - many different things right here is
19:41 - another one of the people who's actually
19:42 - one of my clients and he works with us
19:45 - and i'll show you this right so take a
19:47 - look at this
19:48 - he is making videos on just
19:51 - communication skills and take a look at
19:53 - this
19:54 - right he broke 11 000 subscribers and
19:57 - now
19:58 - he's getting close to a point where he
19:59 - can actually make a living from his
20:01 - channel and some of the other things i'm
20:02 - going to share with you guys is
20:04 - ad revenue on youtube is not the only
20:06 - way
20:07 - to make an income on youtube by the way
20:10 - guys
20:11 - most people think it's just ad revenue
20:12 - no like from my ad revenue i've only
20:15 - made 97
20:16 - 000 but by selling my products i've made
20:19 - over 2.6
20:20 - million dollars under the age of 26.
20:23 - so that's to just show you uh that
20:27 - the real game is actually like
20:29 - understanding
20:30 - how youtube you can use it to then
20:32 - actually even sell something if you
20:34 - really wanted to like scale it up
20:36 - but if you're not worried about scaling
20:37 - it up and just living your passion you
20:39 - can just like go with ad revenue and be
20:41 - fine
20:41 - okay so right this is such a
20:45 - he sits there and he just talks about
20:47 - like listening skills and
20:49 - explaining irvin goffman's expressive
20:51 - order like what the
20:53 - right and look at the viewership that it
20:54 - has here's another video presentation of
20:57 - self and impression man
20:58 - everybody it's bruce lambert
21:01 - right this is a pretty good video
21:03 - because he has really good like
21:05 - content in there but if you look at the
21:07 - video it's pretty simple right he shot
21:08 - it with the webcam
21:09 - it's like fairly straightforward there's
21:12 - no fancy editing
21:14 - right so do you guys feel
21:17 - the people who are here do you feel like
21:19 - you could sit in front of the camera
21:21 - and talk for a few minutes
21:25 - and then just like hit the button to
21:27 - stop can you guys do that
21:29 - is there something that you can share
21:32 - with people that might help them that
21:37 - you can just speak for you don't need to
21:39 - be able to speak to it for more than
21:41 - just a few minutes
21:43 - right like some of my videos i'll show
21:45 - you that are actually
21:47 - uh really really popular and like really
21:50 - really blew up the channel if i actually
21:52 - sort by
21:53 - most popular videos they're just like
21:56 - few videos that really blew up the
21:58 - entire channel and some of them like are
22:00 - pretty simple some of them are pretty
22:01 - complicated and there's a lot of editing
22:03 - that happened
22:04 - and so that's where like you'll you know
22:07 - if you can
22:07 - do that that'll like help you blow up
22:09 - even faster
22:10 - so that was one of my things i want to
22:12 - make sure my videos are good
22:15 - right but here this video if you look at
22:18 - it
22:19 - most of the time i'm sitting there and
22:20 - talking language because once you learn
22:22 - the concept of language as a human being
22:25 - it's a way to express your emotions and
22:27 - ideas to other people once you learn
22:28 - that at its very core
22:30 - you can transfer over to any other
22:32 - language
22:34 - things why you might want
22:38 - like look at that i didn't even edit my
22:40 - gulps
22:41 - like i'm literally gulping [ __ ]
22:44 - in the video like
22:51 - and like it's just there so
22:54 - you can even have videos where it's
22:57 - fairly unedited and you can sit there
22:59 - and talk
22:59 - do any of you guys think you can sit in
23:02 - front of a camera and talk
23:06 - devin says that's all i do now
23:09 - uh matt shark says nope that's what's
23:11 - holding me back so bluntly how do you
23:13 - get the balls to do that oh okay
23:14 - i love that so that's a great question
23:18 - um i like when we get into like
23:20 - questions and answers guys i think
23:21 - that's where i can provide you the most
23:23 - value so if you can think of questions
23:25 - and ask me
23:26 - i would love to answer them and if like
23:28 - nas or anybody frankie or aaron if you
23:30 - guys see really good questions you can
23:31 - just like give them to me
23:33 - like good ones you know not just like
23:34 - generic but something
23:36 - like i would love to answer them um
23:41 - so when it comes to speaking in front of
23:43 - the camera
23:44 - for me it was pretty scary so like i'll
23:46 - give you something
23:48 - um here's the secret you don't need to
23:50 - so watch this video
23:52 - values and what i'm going
23:55 - do you guys see my face anywhere in this
23:57 - video by the way
23:59 - nowhere right so um you can
24:04 - like i don't have my face anywhere in
24:06 - this video i don't have my face anywhere
24:09 - i'll tell you this like if you're truly
24:10 - scared of sitting in front of the camera
24:12 - and talking
24:13 - you don't need to actually even show
24:14 - your face
24:16 - i mean i think it'd be better if you did
24:18 - because people
24:19 - want to follow people and people love
24:21 - like personalities and things like that
24:24 - but
24:24 - you could like there are many channels
24:27 - i'll show you
24:28 - there are many channels that have grown
24:30 - that never ever show their face
24:33 - and some of the coding channels i gave
24:34 - an example of earlier like corey
24:36 - schaefer
24:37 - or traversing media they barely have
24:40 - their face in any of the videos and they
24:41 - get
24:42 - millions and millions of views so
24:45 - um if you're talking about something
24:46 - valuable i
24:48 - don't actually think that that's a
24:50 - requirement if you're like just too
24:51 - scared
24:52 - but i'll show you like in the start i
24:55 - was
24:55 - pretty shy like if you you can hear from
24:57 - my voice i simply did not know
24:59 - where to go even the forums didn't help
25:02 - me
25:03 - so that's pretty much my main point
25:07 - to help everybody else out there so
25:09 - we're going to be taking the codecademy
25:11 - course here
25:12 - and we're going to be taking in in the
25:14 - language called python
25:15 - and there are tons of students in the
25:17 - world here two points older millions
25:20 - it's a fairly different long course
25:23 - and put a loud mouth on me nervous
25:25 - beginner
25:26 - so all right let's pause this before the
25:29 - older me
25:30 - files a copyright infringement lawsuit
25:33 - against myself
25:35 - all right let's get out of here so
25:38 - um i see your face drinking in the
25:41 - branding on the corner
25:43 - yeah exactly um any advice on how to
25:46 - increase your odds and chances
25:48 - in making your video going viral that's
25:50 - a pretty good question too
25:52 - really hey
25:56 - um so
25:59 - to answer the first question guys at
26:01 - first you're gonna suck
26:03 - so worst case scenario hide your face
26:06 - but if you care about bringing your face
26:08 - in um
26:11 - if you care about bringing your face in
26:12 - and learning like just going through the
26:14 - suck like i knew i sucked right about
26:15 - here
26:16 - but like i just did it and then just
26:18 - through sheer
26:19 - practice right sheer practice sheer
26:21 - practice of just making tons and tons of
26:23 - tons and tons of videos
26:25 - then like i transformed as a human being
26:30 - and had like you know just became a very
26:33 - different person and how i spoke and how
26:36 - i talk and how it carried myself and it
26:37 - took a really long time
26:39 - to be able to do that right so you guys
26:41 - can actually go through
26:42 - and actually see the journey so
26:45 - hopefully that answers that question
26:47 - hopefully um okay another one by i'm
26:52 - gonna also take one by julio is there
26:53 - any equipment you recommend for an
26:55 - entrepreneurial livestock channel
26:56 - um frankie can you please like save
26:58 - these questions somewhere
27:00 - maybe just send them to me in slack or
27:02 - or nas can
27:10 - if you guys can just drop them somewhere
27:11 - so i can then have an order and i can
27:13 - just go through them
27:16 - no no i just want to go to nas okay okay
27:18 - all right i'll go to the five thing
27:22 - all right one second guys i'm gonna go
27:25 - to
27:26 - i can't find it youtube does challenge
27:28 - youtube
27:29 - challenge okay here we go
27:33 - nice thank you thank you thank you all
27:34 - right guys so i'm getting all your
27:36 - questions
27:36 - so if you're asking good questions
27:38 - they're going to be here i have a
27:40 - devin's one as well and i'm going to
27:41 - answer in a second so the question about
27:44 - you uh you guys got julio's question
27:47 - saved
27:48 - okay please somebody go ahead and save
27:49 - that and drop that in slack
27:51 - so uh when it comes to making your video
27:54 - go viral i'll share with you guys some
27:56 - secrets on that so
27:58 - what i recommend when it comes to a
28:00 - video going viral
28:01 - is there are there are certain like
28:04 - hacks to it
28:05 - so first step is go and look at the most
28:08 - popular videos of somebody else
28:10 - so if you guys are making your own thing
28:12 - and maybe you're making it on coding or
28:14 - something slightly different
28:15 - you can model this channel and you can
28:18 - see oh this video is
28:19 - the most popular okay can i make a video
28:23 - in coding for top five programming
28:25 - languages to learn
28:27 - if i can then i try to make it as close
28:30 - to this one as possible
28:32 - but then improve in certain areas that's
28:34 - the hack
28:36 - you can either put your ego above
28:38 - everything else or you can put results
28:40 - above everything else
28:41 - guys and let me ask you a question egos
28:44 - or results do you want to feed your ego
28:47 - or do you want to feed your results
28:49 - let me know what do you think if you
28:53 - want to feed results more well then
28:56 - uniqueness is not a great idea let me
28:59 - ask you guys another question
29:00 - if you had an option to open up a
29:02 - physical store
29:04 - do you want to open that physical store
29:06 - up in a desert
29:08 - in the middle of a desert where there's
29:10 - nobody there
29:12 - or would you rather open up your store
29:14 - in a mall where there are other plenty
29:16 - of stores there
29:18 - which one if you picked desert
29:22 - that's that's that's the wrong answer if
29:24 - you picked
29:25 - the mall that's a great answer because
29:29 - there's already foot traffic there right
29:32 - so uniqueness right makes you be
29:35 - you may is like opening up a store in a
29:38 - desert where
29:38 - nobody's ever going to come to your
29:40 - store so people get they want to get too
29:42 - unique what i recommend is like
29:44 - find channels that are similar to your
29:46 - niche look at their most
29:48 - popular videos and then try to make them
29:51 - and if you can make it really closely
29:53 - and then make it better in terms of like
29:55 - the content that you deliver
29:57 - then you're just gone you're gone like
30:00 - you're just gonna fly as a channel
30:02 - and this hack works everywhere um
30:06 - so you know i'm not stealing anybody's
30:09 - content
30:09 - like this is all my content all the
30:12 - ideas are mine
30:13 - but i made it extremely similar but the
30:15 - the title is like the same
30:17 - because i know that that's going to get
30:19 - the most amount of attention and then
30:20 - once i get the attention
30:21 - then i'm gonna deliver and pack it with
30:24 - information does that make sense
30:26 - all right hopefully that answers the
30:28 - question
30:32 - i still don't see julia's question i
30:35 - couldn't see the comments
30:36 - okay all right so uh julia if you can
30:39 - ask that question again
30:40 - um i don't know but we missed it sorry
30:43 - so
30:45 - i think you were asking for
30:47 - recommendations for like equipment julio
30:50 - so what i would say is i have
30:53 - a really amazing setup with my vlogging
30:56 - so if you go to my rafikaze channel
30:58 - right if you go
31:00 - to and by the way guys
31:04 - subscribe to the channel i want to i
31:05 - want to break uh 1000 subscribers
31:08 - here you know so that would really help
31:10 - so
31:11 - um let me click videos hey we broke 900
31:16 - damn that's sick all of the content here
31:20 - is shot with this like vlogging camera
31:22 - that i got and it's
31:24 - like it's the best thing i've ever
31:26 - invested in it makes my life
31:28 - so freaking easy so like i'll show you
31:31 - some of the content so for example here
31:34 - thousand subscribers let's talk about it
31:39 - [Music]
31:45 - guys i've grown my own youtube channel
31:47 - to over 830
31:48 - 000 subscribers called clever way
31:53 - this part is pretty currently time for a
31:56 - coffee break
32:16 - [Applause]
32:23 - [Music]
32:26 - oh
32:28 - [Music]
32:37 - hmm yeah it's good
32:40 - it's real good
32:45 - so that my friends is
32:49 - uh this camera julio is i shot it with
32:54 - sony zv1
32:58 - all right it's right here if i go to my
33:01 - orders
33:05 - oh nice matt short says subbed i love
33:08 - that subscribed already all right cool
33:12 - so let me show you guys here
33:15 - where my where this camera is so
33:19 - i think right here so anyways it's a
33:23 - sony
33:24 - zv1 right here camera for content
33:27 - creators vlogging and youtube with flip
33:28 - screen and microphone
33:29 - so this is the one that i used and then
33:31 - here's the vlogger accessory kit
33:33 - and battery so if you just ordered these
33:36 - whoops the [ __ ]
33:40 - if you ordered these three things you're
33:42 - perfect to start shooting with that
33:44 - but honestly if you want to just shoot
33:46 - the videos that helped me grow to like
33:48 - millions of subscribers
33:49 - or wait not yet what the hell am i
33:51 - talking about pretty soon though
33:53 - uh stuff that's getting helped me get
33:55 - over like 30 million views
33:56 - guys i only i shot most of my content
33:58 - with
33:59 - a logitech like a webcam a cheap ass
34:03 - webcam that's 70 bucks
34:04 - and then i use screenflow to make all my
34:07 - videos all right so
34:08 - that's like a really cheap setup that i
34:11 - would recommend for
34:12 - most of you so here's like logitech
34:15 - whoops let's go logitech
34:18 - uh all right and uh
34:23 - c920 i believe is the webcam you want to
34:25 - use so this
34:26 - is about 70 bucks and then
34:30 - uh the other one that you have is
34:32 - screenflow
34:34 - which will cost you like 100 bucks
34:38 - and for windows it's going to be like
34:39 - camtasia or something crappier so
34:41 - you can use that too but for for ios
34:45 - like screenflow is the way to go and
34:48 - honestly guys if money is an issue you
34:51 - can even use your freaking
34:53 - iphones i'm telling you like i'm not
34:55 - trying to i'm not exaggerating with this
34:57 - i am i for some of my vlogs i've used
35:00 - iphone so like let me
35:02 - and you can use your iphone to actually
35:04 - edit so
35:05 - i edited this one
35:08 - with my iphone to check this one out
35:14 - right
35:17 - so 109k right now
35:20 - it was the top i had was 100
35:24 - i had 150 i'm getting dropped off at the
35:28 - airport
35:29 - and i'm here's my uber driver five-star
35:33 - service
35:36 - random [ __ ] happened yesterday and i was
35:38 - taking care of that so with that said
35:41 - holy crap i just checked our sales and
35:44 - check it out
35:45 - yesterday apparently we did five
35:47 - thousand eight hundred
35:48 - eighty seven dollars almost six thousand
35:51 - thank you
35:53 - so this one so you guys see that right
35:57 - that is shot with sony zv1
36:00 - and i use my iphone to edit it and i use
36:03 - an
36:03 - app called video leap so like you guys
36:06 - in that in in the in software sense i
36:09 - honestly think that video leap is one of
36:12 - the
36:13 - best apps yo guys um
36:16 - video leaps is like the one of the best
36:18 - apps that you guys can use
36:20 - so this i really really recommend for
36:23 - editing on your phone i think it's like
36:25 - one of the best ways to do it
36:29 - like you don't even have to get fancy
36:31 - with editing on final cut pro
36:32 - or screenflow sometimes you can use this
36:35 - and it is amazing cool
36:39 - uh devin says obs is amazing yes obs is
36:41 - really really cool
36:43 - ecamm is even better so if you right now
36:46 - the stream is happening on ecamm
36:48 - all this stuff that i'm doing is
36:49 - happening on ecamm and between the two
36:51 - i'm
36:53 - i'm using i've used both and uh
36:56 - we've gotten over like millions of views
36:58 - using both obs and ecam
37:00 - i am a crazy fan of ecam it's just so
37:04 - much easier like million times easier
37:07 - and gives you
37:08 - everything you could need the difference
37:10 - between
37:11 - like why you would actually need obs
37:14 - versus ecam
37:15 - like you can use ecam for the next
37:19 - four to five years and maybe then you
37:22 - might
37:22 - need um like just obs or streamlabs for
37:26 - some particular reason
37:28 - but i mean obs is free you know so
37:31 - that's that's one thing
37:33 - uh somebody says dinner download video
37:34 - leap okay cool
37:36 - all right so i'm gonna answer some of
37:38 - the questions you guys have
37:39 - asked
37:42 - um how did you schedule so devin asks
37:45 - how did you
37:48 - that's cool i can just share the screen
37:50 - devin asks how do you schedule your
37:53 - content when you have a lot of ideas
37:55 - i honestly like everybody has a
37:57 - different way of going about it i don't
37:58 - schedule really anything
38:00 - i just kind of like randomly i'm sitting
38:02 - there and i feel an idea and i'm like oh
38:04 - [ __ ] it'd be so cool to just make a
38:06 - video on this and then i make it and
38:08 - then that's it
38:09 - and then i just repeat that process
38:11 - forever very few times we had stuff
38:14 - truly planned out on a content calendar
38:17 - um
38:19 - so honestly even with a big team
38:22 - we our content calendar is just like
38:24 - it's very creative you know so
38:26 - i feel like sometimes you know again and
38:30 - my personality
38:31 - might be really different than yours i
38:33 - just once i feel inspired i just do it
38:35 - and um you know i just usually just go
38:38 - one idea at a time just one i try not to
38:40 - look too far ahead because it gets
38:41 - really complicated
38:43 - you know i'm a professional chess player
38:44 - i'm like top one percent in the world
38:46 - and even with chess like i you know they
38:49 - say the best chess players
38:51 - they ask them like hey how many moves
38:52 - you look ahead and they asked alexander
38:54 - alakine and he's like
38:56 - just one so even in chess i'm usually
38:59 - just looking one move ahead
39:01 - i think simple there's something
39:02 - beautiful about simplicity
39:05 - uh logan blom asks you look shy
39:09 - at your first videos how did you change
39:11 - your mindset or just need to practice
39:13 - oh i can't help emphasize the word
39:16 - practice in there i cannot emphasize the
39:19 - word practice in there so let me
39:21 - go like this all right
39:26 - if you could only
39:29 - do practice or you could only do mindset
39:33 - to improve your skill
39:34 - which one would you guys choose let me
39:37 - put another way
39:38 - if you could only use mindset to grow
39:41 - your
39:42 - muscles or you could only use practice
39:44 - aka
39:45 - exercise to grow your muscles which one
39:47 - would you choose if you could choose
39:48 - only one guys
39:50 - you could choose only one
39:53 - that is the [ __ ] difference i
39:56 - as gary v would say i'm a practitioner
40:00 - um i don't live in fury land la la land
40:03 - there are a lot of people that are
40:05 - way way way smarter than me they sound
40:08 - way smarter they're brilliant minds
40:11 - but what are their results what are what
40:14 - are their channels like
40:16 - problem is they live too much in here
40:20 - so the practicality is where really
40:22 - everything happens i cannot emphasize
40:24 - that enough
40:25 - i believe that mindset will help you but
40:28 - like i think your focus should be 99
40:30 - on practice you will just improve so
40:32 - fast if you focus on practice
40:34 - there we go practice it's a muscle
40:36 - memory guys
40:38 - if you have to pick between the one
40:40 - practice right
40:41 - you can't just choose mindset and just
40:43 - think about working out but never work
40:45 - out you gotta go so if you have to pick
40:46 - between the one you would pick practice
40:48 - and i would say that i would emphasize
40:50 - the practice part a lot
40:52 - more mindset is of course part of the
40:53 - game and i used to watch a lot of
40:55 - content on how to improve yourself your
40:57 - communication skills
40:58 - i would go and like meet strangers and
41:01 - that would help me i would go and like
41:02 - interview strangers there was a lot of
41:05 - hardship that i've put myself
41:06 - through to develop these communication
41:08 - skills that i have today
41:10 - um so yeah yeah
41:13 - um it you can develop it i promise you
41:16 - can develop it
41:17 - if you put in a lot of practice if you
41:19 - make the [ __ ] amount of videos i've
41:20 - made you will get there
41:22 - i've made over 1 000 plus videos plus
41:25 - lives like maybe close to 2 000
41:28 - right and this is not including the
41:30 - amount of instagram stories i've made
41:32 - oh my god where i'm speaking i mean if
41:34 - you added it all up i probably have over
41:36 - like 10 to 30 000 of hours of like
41:39 - video footage and content where i was
41:42 - speaking and saying words
41:44 - you get really really damn good at it
41:46 - and just becomes second nature
41:49 - all right cool um but great great great
41:52 - great great great question
41:54 - uh nikhil asks how did you decide on
41:57 - what content and what videos you want to
41:58 - create
41:59 - it was very simple i
42:02 - saw everybody in my computer programming
42:05 - courses
42:06 - quit college and they're like [ __ ] this
42:08 - they started hating computer science
42:09 - because of how i was taught they started
42:10 - hating programming how i was taught
42:12 - luckily for me i learned programming on
42:14 - my own
42:16 - and so i learned it in a way that was a
42:19 - lot more fun entertaining at my own pace
42:21 - and so i'm like i'm gonna just teach it
42:23 - in a fun way
42:24 - and i want like i just need
42:27 - here's another thing right this is
42:29 - another important thing
42:31 - guys you don't need that many people
42:34 - to be happy or to get the results that
42:37 - you want right
42:39 - guys how many jobs do you need to
42:42 - you need to have to feel secure
42:45 - just one right how many viewers need to
42:49 - watch my video for me to feel happy
42:52 - just one how many people need to
42:56 - watch my content and have their lives
42:58 - changed as a result of it
42:59 - for me to feel fulfilled
43:02 - just one so
43:06 - when i think about this how did you
43:07 - decide to on what content what videos
43:09 - you want to create
43:10 - for me it was all about like i am
43:13 - learning programming
43:14 - i'm just gonna share everything i know
43:17 - it'll help one person it'll help
43:18 - the older me or sorry the younger me
43:22 - right as long as i can help the younger
43:23 - me or the me in the past
43:26 - that would be amazing that is all i
43:29 - could
43:29 - ask for and dream about so that is how i
43:33 - decided to go
43:34 - and i didn't let any insecurities get in
43:36 - the way even though they did
43:37 - you know for a while i just went so
43:41 - that's on that end all right let's see
43:43 - what other questions
43:44 - we have um is it good idea to have
43:48 - two channels with the same content in
43:49 - english and spanish here's the truth
43:52 - most people don't even have the
43:54 - bandwidth to produce on one channel
43:56 - so i think it makes your life very tough
43:58 - if you think you can do it then do it
44:00 - okay all right
44:03 - uh pulkit says did you advertise your
44:05 - channels in your videos automatically or
44:07 - this automatically start getting
44:08 - traction
44:09 - they got traction by themselves i
44:12 - recommend you guys never spend a dollar
44:15 - on something that hasn't made you a
44:16 - dollar yet
44:17 - all right it's a recipe for absolute
44:20 - disaster catastrophe
44:22 - okay if you cannot make one dollar
44:27 - with zero dollars all right if you
44:29 - cannot make one dollar with zero dollars
44:33 - you should not spend one dollar but
44:36 - if with zero dollars you can make one
44:39 - dollar
44:40 - then you can spend that one dollar and
44:42 - now make two dollars does that make
44:44 - sense
44:45 - so eventually we learned how to do paid
44:48 - like first i learned organic marketing
44:50 - through youtube and then we learned
44:51 - paid advertising and now when we spend
44:53 - money we make a lot of money back
44:55 - because we understand principles of
44:56 - content marketing
44:58 - youtube messaging um how to sell a
45:01 - product how to pitch
45:03 - a lot of skills a lot of principles you
45:05 - got to learn along the way
45:06 - as you're getting there right but the
45:09 - important thing is in the start
45:10 - keep it very very simple so you can
45:12 - actually enjoy the journey along the way
45:14 - of like wherever you're getting
45:18 - quani says what mistakes would you
45:20 - correct that you made in the past to
45:21 - speed up your growth and getting to 800
45:23 - 000 subscribers
45:24 - faster i think that
45:29 - uh that's a great question and i think i
45:30 - would be very religious to making
45:32 - really really big heavy hitting content
45:34 - on a regular basis which something
45:36 - i'm just thought about right now and i'm
45:38 - like holy [ __ ] like
45:39 - we should actually make top five a
45:41 - priority for this week like number one
45:43 - like the only one priority for youtube
45:46 - this week
45:47 - because we need to shoot that video and
45:49 - like we should actually have a
45:50 - deliverable date
45:51 - so what's a good deliverable date um
45:56 - nas what do you feel like no
45:59 - absolutely not bro i'll shoot it if i
46:01 - need to oh
46:05 - okay so 23. cool
46:09 - so we'll we're going to drop a video so
46:12 - you guys see
46:12 - you guys saw the process november 20
46:14 - what
46:16 - no cool so you guys saw the process
46:19 - november 23rd we'll drop top five
46:21 - programming languages to learn in 2021
46:23 - that's going to be the next
46:25 - biggest banger and it's going to get a
46:27 - lot of views because you guys saw
46:28 - the one we dropped in 2020 got so many
46:31 - views
46:31 - and so if we actually make sure that
46:35 - we're dropping
46:36 - home run titles every week
46:40 - some some not home runs right some like
46:43 - hey
46:43 - like something just to help people out
46:45 - and give value like we're going to talk
46:47 - about how to build apps and we're going
46:48 - to talk about how to build your resume
46:50 - and portfolio
46:51 - and all of that but then there are home
46:54 - run titles that we're gonna do
46:55 - and that gets us that big big big reach
46:59 - all right cool people said you dropped
47:03 - should be still here
47:08 - um
47:10 - cool all right cool cool cool all right
47:13 - so that's what i would fix
47:14 - i would be very religious about making
47:17 - sure
47:17 - i'm dropping consistent content like
47:20 - banger i call it banger
47:21 - titles like the i'm dropping the bangers
47:24 - on a consistent basis that would be
47:26 - really important
47:27 - um who inspired you to go on youtube did
47:32 - you remember that
47:33 - so for me i was inspired in a weird way
47:37 - it was out of the hate for the college
47:39 - education system
47:40 - and how much it sucked and how they
47:43 - killed your soul
47:44 - and any ounce of joy or curiosity you
47:47 - had to pursue really anything because
47:49 - it would go hey make the hello world
47:51 - week one all right week two make a
47:53 - complicated pizza application that has
47:56 - modular la la la
47:58 - and everybody's like oh my god i'm
47:59 - quitting college programming is not for
48:01 - me
48:02 - so that inspired me and then some other
48:06 - stuff that inspired me was i saw how
48:07 - many crappy
48:08 - other youtube channels there were that
48:10 - were making this content and getting so
48:12 - many viewership and so many subscribers
48:14 - from the start it was a lot
48:16 - out of like anger and like
48:19 - um what are these people doing like i i
48:22 - wanted to just help
48:23 - in any way i can and i wanted to make
48:25 - the education system better
48:27 - um and then as time progressed i went
48:30 - from having like these like negative
48:32 - type of
48:32 - uh drivers like like for example like
48:35 - having jealousy or envy be my driver or
48:37 - having uh
48:38 - you know ah [ __ ] this other person's
48:41 - like youtube channel like i want to make
48:42 - a better one than them there is so bad
48:44 - like those were like my low level like
48:48 - motivators and start
48:49 - but then as time progressed i you know
48:52 - 2017 2018
48:54 - i got really unhappy with that because i
48:57 - i had like ran away and
48:58 - beat everybody that i could and then it
49:01 - was like what do i do
49:02 - now and i like was go surpassing all my
49:04 - mentors and everybody that like i had
49:07 - set a goal and i was like
49:08 - this is a really weird [ __ ] moment
49:10 - like what do i do now
49:11 - who do i compete with or try to be
49:15 - like i just ran out and so i had to
49:17 - really reverse engineer how i thought
49:19 - about everything and that was extremely
49:21 - hard
49:24 - but now my motivation is very different
49:26 - and
49:27 - my north stars are very different and
49:30 - now
49:31 - you know like for example now one of our
49:32 - biggest driving goal is to help 5 000
49:35 - developers get jobs in 2021
49:38 - and if 5 000 developers got jobs that
49:41 - paid them 50 000
49:43 - a year or more well here's a cool thing
49:45 - that happens
49:48 - that adds 250 million dollars
49:51 - to the global economy so now it's
49:54 - actually really exciting to help the
49:56 - global economy improve
49:58 - by helping developers get jobs so that
50:01 - is a much more
50:02 - interesting and fascinating and exciting
50:04 - goal than
50:06 - i want to beat this other youtube
50:08 - channel but hey
50:09 - if it gets you going in the start it's
50:11 - still good
50:13 - all right um so let's see if there are
50:16 - more
50:16 - questions we have uh okay
50:20 - is it okay to use the same video title
50:22 - how to make a distinguishable title
50:24 - yeah it's okay to use the same title
50:26 - thumbnail and title is the name of the
50:28 - game
50:28 - so yes you can make the same video title
50:32 - um and you don't really need it to be
50:34 - distinguishable you can have it be
50:36 - distinguishable like
50:37 - literally at the end it could just say
50:39 - stacy
50:41 - like for rafa cosby i could literally
50:42 - have get somebody else's exact title and
50:44 - add the word rafi in there or
50:46 - add rafikaze in there i could um so yeah
50:49 - it's not
50:50 - too hard to be able to do that and you
50:52 - don't really need it to be that much
50:53 - distinguishable you can
50:55 - but like if it's popular i would stay
50:57 - very close to it then like thumbnail i
50:59 - would make it a little bit different
51:00 - than like video i would just like pack
51:02 - it with my truth and my content
51:04 - my values um
51:07 - okay cool how much earned from
51:10 - uploading videos to be honest youtube
51:13 - for us doesn't pay us that much
51:14 - like it's because we're a coding channel
51:17 - and our cpms are really low
51:18 - so you know right now you guys saw we're
51:21 - getting between 150 200
51:22 - a day from just youtube what's up
51:27 - oh somebody asked that oh yeah see uh
51:30 - it's just like how
51:31 - cost per thousand impressions so it's
51:33 - like how much youtube pays you per
51:35 - like the ads they run on your videos and
51:38 - so
51:39 - um that's the automatic money you get
51:41 - paid for making content that's another
51:42 - way of thinking about it
51:44 - and it's very little for a channel like
51:47 - ours the coding channel because
51:49 - the market the watch is a coding channel
51:51 - they don't have a lot of money so
51:53 - our channel because of that won't make a
51:56 - lot of money
51:57 - it's going to be like lower on the cpms
51:59 - but that's okay like we're not worried
52:00 - about the money we just want to help
52:01 - them get jobs
52:02 - with our growth right now and where
52:04 - we're at we're making between
52:06 - three to five thousand dollars a month
52:08 - so i'll say that okay
52:10 - uh that's how much it's paying us
52:15 - uh okay koch says what was the hardest
52:19 - and easiest things you did to get where
52:21 - you are
52:22 - hardest things i've done uh to to get
52:25 - where i'm
52:25 - at are man hardest things is like
52:29 - letting
52:30 - team members go from the team i think
52:32 - that's one of
52:33 - the hardest things to do um
52:37 - and then when it comes to the easiest
52:39 - things is
52:40 - to grow is like just literally the also
52:44 - similar thing like hiring the
52:46 - people who are like really good fits and
52:48 - so hiring the right people
52:50 - is the best way to grow my business
52:53 - like it's has been the best uh way to
52:56 - grow business historically
52:57 - and the other one is the hardest uh
52:59 - other things that were really hard
53:02 - i think is um
53:04 - [Music]
53:06 - trying to grow my business alone and
53:08 - having this attitude of like [ __ ] it
53:09 - i'll do it myself
53:10 - it got me far but it could only get me
53:13 - so far
53:14 - and you know what got you here won't get
53:15 - you there and so i was like
53:17 - stuck at small levels and so right now
53:20 - we're growing fast
53:21 - we're expanding fast because that
53:23 - mentality has
53:24 - changed and like learning leadership was
53:27 - one of the hardest things and leadership
53:30 - is a lot about like actually being a
53:31 - servant leader like actually listening
53:33 - to people
53:34 - being really humble truly
53:39 - truly putting some of the team like team
53:41 - members actually like above you
53:42 - serving to their needs uh and so that's
53:45 - like a really hard part like
53:48 - most of the team gets paid as much as me
53:51 - or more
53:52 - uh anytime somebody's salary is about to
53:54 - increase everybody's salary increases
53:56 - before
53:56 - mine increases um i'm i'm not actually
54:00 - paying myself
54:00 - that much and i do everything out of my
54:03 - personal for all my personal stuff and
54:07 - i don't even go clothes shopping i don't
54:08 - do fancy [ __ ] everything is reinvested
54:11 - back into the business
54:12 - back into this back into the people
54:16 - so that's where my intentions are and
54:18 - that's what my actions show i think that
54:20 - has made me a way better leader over
54:21 - time
54:22 - i think that's 2017 and got me the
54:24 - respect of my team
54:25 - i think earlier in 2017 2018 success got
54:28 - to my head really really quickly and i
54:30 - became an [ __ ]
54:32 - and i was mean to people and i didn't
54:34 - really care that much about what was
54:35 - happening
54:36 - i got into fame into money into success
54:39 - into just
54:39 - everything really really really quick
54:42 - and for me i didn't know how to handle i
54:44 - was just like living in the fanciest
54:45 - places in
54:46 - la i was like traveling everywhere
54:48 - around the world i dated whoever i
54:50 - wanted like it was just it was
54:52 - crazy and so it was a lot it was a
54:54 - different type of lifestyle and then
54:57 - end of 2018 i kind of was at the brink
54:59 - of losing
55:00 - everything and then 2019 was where i had
55:03 - a rebirth and 2020 is just
55:05 - oh my [ __ ] lord like
55:09 - we're just getting started though so
55:10 - that's the cool thing we're growing
55:12 - faster than we've ever had before
55:14 - but i really truly believe that
55:17 - this is just the complete beginning
55:20 - and i cannot like i i'm just so excited
55:22 - about working with everybody here
55:24 - i'm so thankful that you are here
55:26 - watching this like
55:27 - seriously everybody who's here watching
55:29 - this right now i'm like so extremely
55:31 - thankful and grateful for that and now
55:33 - what i'm extremely excited about is the
55:36 - impact that we can create together so
55:37 - for example i'll tell you something
55:38 - right
55:39 - when i make a video what i look at is
55:43 - how much did it
55:43 - help the world move forward so i'll tell
55:45 - you what that means so
55:47 - let's just go to the last seven days
55:50 - all right i'll click on watch time
55:54 - now i have this watch time over here and
55:57 - it says 30
55:58 - 000 hours this month okay so now i'm
56:00 - going to take 30 000
56:02 - hours and divide it by 24
56:06 - because there are 24 hours in day that
56:08 - gives me 1250 days and i'm going to
56:10 - divide that by 365 to get years
56:12 - it gives me 3.4 years so let me show you
56:15 - let me tell you what i'm talk
56:17 - gonna get to here okay
56:20 - in the last seven days okay
56:23 - in just the last seven days here
56:27 - we have produced enough value and we
56:29 - help the world
56:34 - move forward by three and a half years
56:40 - so think about that literally
56:44 - in the last week we helped the entire
56:47 - world move forward by three and a half
56:49 - years
56:50 - so this is the metric i look at that's
56:53 - the metric i look at
56:54 - this is how much value we've provided so
56:57 - if in one week we can help the world
56:58 - move forward by three years
56:59 - well let's take a look at how much we
57:01 - helped the world move forward
57:03 - this year so let's just click 2020.
57:06 - 1.5 million hours so let's take a look
57:10 - at what that accounts to so we'll do 1.5
57:13 - million
57:14 - hours divided by 24 divided by 365.
57:18 - we have helped the world move forward
57:24 - by whoops
57:28 - by 171 years just this year
57:32 - right so that is like everything
57:36 - that is the most exciting thing to us
57:39 - and so what i think about is how much
57:41 - impact we can have
57:42 - if i could be even like
57:45 - a little sherpa or just like a little
57:48 - stepping stone for you
57:49 - that could inspire you to start your own
57:52 - youtube channel so you can actually make
57:54 - an impact
57:55 - and together maybe we can move this
57:58 - number up to
57:59 - 200 years or 250 years
58:02 - and maybe there's just one person that i
58:04 - can help inspire here that goes
58:06 - on and helps change lives of other
58:08 - people
58:09 - helps get other people get jobs helps
58:12 - share what they know so then other
58:13 - people watching your stuff get inspired
58:15 - and move
58:16 - faster and move forward that
58:19 - is the most unbelievably exciting thing
58:22 - to me
58:23 - i've never felt more in my purpose i've
58:26 - never felt more in my calling
58:27 - i literally have never felt happier than
58:30 - i have had in the
58:31 - recent like last few days because this i
58:34 - feel like
58:34 - is you know like if we actually work on
58:37 - this together
58:38 - and you guys actually jump in and
58:41 - actually start your youtube channels
58:43 - and start making content and start
58:45 - providing value to the world
58:46 - i think that it's gonna be pretty
58:48 - unbelievable what we would be able to
58:50 - actually achieve
58:51 - and the change we will be able to create
58:53 - in the world and i would love to
58:54 - document that
58:56 - i would love to document that i would
58:57 - love to just have all of our wins
58:59 - combined together
59:01 - all of our youtube channels like i would
59:02 - love to have it somewhere where
59:04 - if you guys like were producing content
59:07 - i'd love to be able to sh
59:08 - like put it in an air table and talk
59:10 - about it like yo
59:11 - together all of us just like
59:15 - made this much impact in the world and
59:17 - if you can even help the world move
59:18 - forward by one minute
59:20 - or one day that is huge that's what i
59:23 - used to look at when i was in college
59:24 - like when i decided to drop out i was
59:27 - just seeing these tiny things and i was
59:29 - like oh my god my one days of effort
59:31 - has produced two days of like moving
59:33 - forward of the world
59:34 - oh my god my two days of effort has
59:36 - helped the world move forward by four it
59:38 - is
59:38 - that is insane if i can keep doing that
59:41 - well then of course i can
59:42 - for money i can make four times the
59:44 - amount of money because i'm helping the
59:46 - world move forward by four times
59:47 - i can make four times the amount of
59:49 - impact because i'm helping the world
59:51 - move forward four times
59:52 - so that was like just one of the most
59:56 - exciting things for me that became my
59:57 - drivers that became the reason i do what
59:59 - i do
60:00 - and i did what i did and i continue to
60:03 - do
60:03 - what i continue to do so would you guys
60:07 - want to join me on this journey like i'm
60:09 - starting my own youtube channel that's
60:11 - like completely from
60:13 - scratch the rafikaze one and building it
60:16 - up
60:16 - would you guys want to join me as we
60:19 - start to head into 2021

60:25 - finish it off and maybe you have one
60:27 - [ __ ] view one view but we can add it

60:55 - now thinking about it but if we
60:56 - all had youtube channels that were

61:30 - being here
61:31 - but like this energy and momentum

61:43 - that was kind of cool you guys know what
61:45 - i'm talking about where you get riled up
61:47 - but then the day passes and nothing has
61:48 - happened
61:49 - here's one hack i want you to do and
61:52 - studies scientific studies have shown
61:54 - that this takes your level of success of
61:56 - doing something
61:57 - from a 30 to a 90 would you guys like to
62:01 - take your commitment of starting your
62:03 - youtube channel making your first video
62:04 - from a 30
62:05 - to a 90 well then let me share something
62:08 - with you
62:09 - there's something called implementation
62:11 - intention all right
62:13 - scientists have found that motivation
62:15 - can get you 30 of the way there
62:17 - but if you set an implementation
62:19 - intention it gets you there
62:20 - 90 plus percent of the times so here's
62:23 - how you set an implementation intention
62:25 - i want you guys to set it all together
62:27 - with me

70:17 - if you guys want to make your life
70:18 - simple just point the camera yourself or

71:48 - said
71:48 - is absolute money and i want you to pay
71:52 - attention to this all right this is
71:53 - money
71:54 - this is money okay there is a layer of
71:58 - private accountability but it's when
72:00 - you're doing something that's new that
72:02 - you haven't done before
72:03 - that doesn't mean [ __ ] because a week
72:05 - later you're not gonna do it
72:06 - he is going to do public accountability
72:09 - so this is a beautiful
72:11 - tactic that julio is going to use make
72:14 - your first video with your iphone that
72:16 - talks about your commitment to make
72:18 - another video on your youtube channel
72:20 - and literally talks about your plan of
72:23 - how you're gonna make the video
72:25 - what you're gonna make it about what
72:27 - camera you're gonna use
72:28 - what time you're gonna shoot it
72:29 - literally make your first video on you

73:32 - okay this is gonna help improve your
73:33 - videos
73:34 - first 50 seconds to 60 seconds are
73:36 - extremely important
73:38 - don't leave the screen in one area i
73:40 - want you to visually like look for your
73:42 - first
73:42 - 40 50 seconds you literally don't even
73:44 - move the screen
73:46 - so don't do that bro move
73:49 - like it's the most important so give
73:52 - snippet of what's gonna happen
73:53 - all right like literally i would start
73:56 - the video off
73:57 - like really really quick okay i'll give
73:59 - you an example
74:01 - so let me go to my slideshow right
74:03 - here's the mistake most people make
74:06 - i'll show you the mistake most people
74:08 - make right
74:09 - uh guys here's the video today we're
74:13 - going to talk about your
74:15 - opportunity to grow your youtube even if
74:17 - you're a complete beginner
74:19 - now it's important because there are
74:21 - many things that are important in life
74:23 - and um you know you you got it so
74:26 - let's um you know so yeah
74:29 - youtube is a very important thing and
74:31 - you want to grow your youtube channel
74:32 - and it's important you see like how
74:35 - [ __ ] boring that is because
74:37 - it's one screen and especially if you
74:38 - clicked on my video you're like [ __ ]
74:40 - this i don't have time for this
74:42 - so here's the hack you want to do
74:44 - visually every five seconds especially
74:47 - in the start i want the thing to keep
74:48 - moving
74:49 - the first second is going to start off
74:51 - like this in the first second i want to
74:53 - make it extremely relevant so i want to
74:55 - be like
74:56 - literally with the the second the video
74:57 - starts i would do this i'd be like
75:00 - guys what is up this is your opportunity
75:03 - to grow your youtube even if you're a
75:05 - complete beginner now turn off your
75:06 - phones
75:07 - now tag me here and who am i i'm
75:10 - rafikaze i made a hundred forty thousand
75:12 - four thousand dollars 21 as a freelance
75:13 - developer taught hundred thousand
75:14 - students to code became a millionaire at
75:16 - 25.
75:17 - here's my youtube channel now let's get
75:18 - into the training so you guys saw how in
75:21 - the first 10 or 20 seconds
75:23 - you're already hooked i've given you the
75:26 - lowdown
75:26 - we're already into the training and
75:29 - moving fast
75:31 - all right um so what i would recommend
75:34 - for this video
75:35 - is i would have a few slides all right
75:39 - out of a few slides that go before this
75:42 - that just talk about what the entire
75:43 - video is going to contain
75:45 - so here i see that you're going to talk
75:47 - about six skills
75:49 - so you can actually in the start just
75:51 - give some kind of preface to the six
75:53 - skills that you're gonna talk about and
75:54 - just move through those slides
75:56 - and then go to talk about them and i
75:57 - think that could be another
75:59 - good way to do it but in the start keep
76:01 - the pacing good
76:02 - keep it relevant and you'll do great
76:08 - all righty where did the facebook go
76:15 - this is my latest video okay dope
76:18 - i'd love to take a look at it on the
76:20 - next um when we do the next live stream
76:22 - i would love to take a look at it
76:24 - henry says i've tried to shoot a video
76:26 - several times but i have anxiety
76:27 - disorder so i can't record my face it
76:29 - gives me so much shame i'll try it
76:31 - without recording myself hope it works
76:32 - okay
76:33 - so if it's like very bad then do it but
76:36 - if you feel like you can work on the
76:37 - skill and improve it by practicing then
76:39 - do that too because i want you guys to
76:41 - improve your self-esteems
76:43 - as you do the video process okay i'll
76:46 - tell you one thing
76:47 - for me video was always just a way to
76:50 - get better at public speaking
76:51 - all right so yes i want to make great
76:53 - videos but i cared more about
76:56 - improving my public speaking skills so
76:58 - what i wanted to do was make sure that i
77:00 - make videos in one take i show myself
77:03 - then i can like actually work on myself
77:05 - how i come across the camera
77:06 - and then do that again and again and
77:08 - again and again and again and again and
77:09 - again like busta rhymes
77:11 - so for you i would recommend
77:14 - a similar thing henry but if again if
77:17 - you're just truly like just [ __ ] you up
77:20 - then okay do it with that with you not
77:22 - showing the face okay
77:24 - all right so yuri says let's go what's
77:27 - the software you just mentioned for
77:28 - music and sound effects just now
77:30 - um i didn't mention the software for
77:32 - music and sound effects but you guys can
77:34 - use epidemic
77:34 - sounds that's what i use for
77:38 - all my music and sounds i actually use
77:41 - epidemic sounds alright so basically
77:44 - what i'll do
77:45 - is i'll hit search sometimes and i'll
77:46 - like type in lo-fi
77:48 - music and then i'll link below okay
77:50 - here's a good one
77:59 - [Music]

80:30 - with it so that's like another
80:32 - cool thing i would love to have your
80:33 - feedback kazzy on my coding channel code
80:35 - like crazy
80:36 - okay so let's go take a look at this
80:38 - channel
80:40 - uh 524 subscribers nice good job that's
80:44 - actually like
80:47 - are you sure
80:51 - no i mentioned it this is no this is not
80:53 - owen student
80:54 - the onus owen student is different oh by
80:58 - the way can you contact ibrahim
81:00 - right now and say hey can you put us in
81:01 - touch with the student who want to do
81:02 - the javascript thing
81:05 - just just send them that to send them
81:07 - there was a student that wanted to work
81:08 - with qazi to do programming content
81:11 - because he's local to la and he can
81:12 - actually come in and make programming
81:14 - content and i would love to have him on
81:16 - our clever programmer channel
81:17 - that would be [ __ ] sick all right
81:22 - so what's going on here all right so
81:24 - let's take a look
81:25 - now let me sort what i like to do
81:28 - is i just start off by sorting with the
81:30 - most popular videos and seeing like
81:32 - what's your most popular content
81:34 - because that's what you should be making
81:36 - a lot of so have you made more videos
81:38 - like this one
81:40 - um okay i would be careful about cute
81:43 - titles
81:44 - react to folio like i would avoid them
81:48 - unless the videos are just god level
81:50 - which most of the times you know like
81:51 - they might not be so i would try to
81:54 - avoid uh
81:56 - cute titles like that i would keep it
81:58 - like yeah just react portfolio you can
81:59 - say that
82:00 - thumbnails i would work on the
82:01 - thumbnails i think there's too much
82:03 - happening in the thumbnails so like
82:06 - here's what i would recommend right
82:07 - go on youtube and just type in react
82:10 - portfolio
82:11 - and see what kind of stuff comes up so
82:14 - let's type this in
82:17 - this guys did well so i would copy this
82:20 - thumbnail all right i would stick
82:21 - very close to this thumbnail uh here's
82:24 - another there are a few other thumbnails
82:26 - that worked well i would stick also
82:28 - maybe with that one
82:30 - this one worked well create react app
82:32 - portfolio website so
82:34 - here's another one that worked well
82:38 - uh this one worked i mean this is a hard
82:40 - one to make but
82:42 - you know that one so i would try to make
82:45 - ones that are there out there what i see
82:48 - with yours is it's
82:50 - uh there's it's too much it's there's
82:52 - it's really noisy
82:54 - you like it's a lot like season episode
82:57 - one
82:58 - [ __ ] on attacks text more text
83:02 - logos it's too much so
83:05 - simplify it and it'll do better so if i
83:08 - show you
83:08 - on if i go to clever
83:13 - programmer and we click here
83:17 - and we go to videos let me sort by
83:20 - the most popular so you'll see like the
83:22 - ones that are more simplified they do
83:25 - really well like here's an example of
83:27 - like a really simple one
83:30 - that one did really really well here's
83:32 - another one that i really
83:34 - like here's one that's pretty simple so
83:36 - i would do
83:37 - more like ones that are simple
83:40 - clean and those perform well uh
83:44 - on what i would recommend is you just
83:46 - having a picture from the
83:48 - side of you coding on a computer or like
83:51 - actually the portfolio is open so like
83:54 - you're sitting like this and you're
83:57 - right and
83:57 - the camera shot is from the side and
83:59 - like literally just
84:01 - a shot of you coding looking at the
84:03 - computer and the portfolio is open i
84:05 - think that would do the best
84:07 - and then just like white text in the
84:09 - middle that says like react portfolio
84:11 - make it [ __ ] clean and it'll
84:13 - bang and just of course make the video
84:15 - good
84:16 - uh beautiful so guys what i want to tell

90:38 - channeling gary vee
90:39 - it's not gonna work it's not meant like
90:42 - why do we

90:47 - don't know if it's like our
90:48 - parents just [ __ ] us up as a
90:50 - generation or what
90:51 - is it that like we just need to win
90:54 - right this second

91:00 - and now you're going to knock him out
91:02 - you've never [ __ ] boxed it's not

91:12 - with business they're like i'm just
91:13 - going to go into it i'm just going to
91:14 - knock it out of the park and if i
91:16 - don't i'm a failure i suck i should just
91:18 - quit
91:20 - what is wrong with you like you're sup
91:23 - who gave you the audacity to think
91:25 - you're gonna win in the first place
91:27 - i'll tell you a little bit of my
91:28 - background right from ages of 9 to 12
91:30 - i went to this religious school where i
91:32 - was beaten the [ __ ] out of every day
91:34 - i was a nine-year-old kid it would start
91:36 - at 8 a.m to school and it would go all
91:38 - the way up until 10
91:39 - p.m for 14 to 15 hours a day okay
91:42 - i would have my hands freezing in the
91:45 - chicago winter negative 10 degrees
91:47 - come downstairs and the teacher
91:50 - would take take the plunger take the
91:52 - plunger part out of it take that thick
91:54 - wooden stick and
91:55 - smash my hands uh he would lift up our
91:58 - like jeans so our shins were showing
92:00 - they would like smash us on our shins
92:02 - if we went home and we're like oh we got
92:04 - bruises or
92:05 - you know they're beating us up then they
92:06 - would beat us up even more
92:08 - it was like crazy right four years of
92:11 - this and so
92:12 - i went through all this crazy [ __ ] it
92:16 - sucked it was like hell every day
92:17 - most people who went there got [ __ ] up
92:19 - kind of permanently for me
92:21 - i got [ __ ] up in a really good way i
92:24 - learned
92:24 - gratitude i learned humility i learned
92:27 - happiness out of it those were the
92:28 - lessons i learned out of it because
92:30 - every single day i woke up and i didn't
92:32 - get beat up
92:34 - every single day i wake up and it's 9
92:38 - a.m and i get out of bed
92:39 - and i haven't gotten the living [ __ ]
92:42 - beat out of me
92:44 - oh my god is that a win like whoa
92:47 - this is another day let's go guys how
92:50 - are you doing like
92:51 - yo what's up frankie how you doing
92:54 - amberley baby what's going on
92:55 - so for me every day i wake up feels
92:58 - like i have won like the biggest lottery
93:03 - so then when i get one view
93:06 - i am like ecstatic the first time i got
93:08 - two subscribers
93:10 - i ran around my entire house in my
93:12 - underwear just
93:13 - running around screaming at the top of
93:15 - my lungs my parents were like what the
93:16 - [ __ ] is wrong with you
93:17 - but they were even like happy and they
93:19 - were like yeah let's go
93:22 - my friends at the same time who also
93:24 - started a youtube channel i'm not going
93:26 - to name any names
93:28 - they quit why they always just had an
93:32 - expectation that they were meant to blow
93:34 - up that they were meant to get millions
93:36 - of views they had really high standard
93:38 - of excellence their parents [ __ ] them
93:39 - up by just setting expectations and
93:42 - standards like trillion times higher so
93:45 - every day when they got 50 views do you
93:48 - think they saw it as a win
93:49 - or a loss then the next day when they
93:52 - would drop a video and they get 150
93:53 - views
93:54 - do you think decided winner lost when
93:56 - they got their first subscribe five
93:57 - subscribers
93:59 - do you think they saw that as a win or a
94:00 - loss everything was just
94:03 - lost lose lose losing streak
94:06 - everything and it just got worse and
94:08 - worse so
94:10 - even when they were hitting days where
94:11 - they're getting 100 subscribers
94:13 - in their minds they were meant to be
94:14 - getting 5000 subscribers a day
94:17 - so the reality and their expectation was
94:20 - totally out of alignment which led to
94:22 - unhappiness
94:24 - just depression anxiety
94:29 - complete mental breakdown and they would
94:32 - just
94:32 - quit i've seen this happen it sucks it
94:35 - [ __ ] sucks and so if there's one
94:38 - thing i can push
94:39 - it's just mindset going there you're
94:42 - meant to [ __ ] lose
94:43 - lose every [ __ ] day you're not meant
94:45 - to get views you're just starting you
94:48 - can't go in and
94:49 - beat mike tyson my guy you can't
94:52 - like you need to work no
94:55 - you're gonna lose expect to lose the
94:58 - days you win
94:58 - is a huge win the days you break even
95:02 - and you get one view or five views is a
95:04 - huge win
95:05 - those types of expectations and how like
95:08 - here's what people do
95:10 - this is their life right they they make
95:13 - the rules
95:15 - of their life that
95:18 - they're going to be happy half a percent
95:20 - of the time and they're going to be
95:21 - unhappy 99.9 percent of the time so i'll
95:23 - give you an example one of my friends
95:24 - wanted to start a business
95:26 - and he's like i'm going gonna open up a
95:27 - business this month i said okay that's
95:28 - so cool bro i love it
95:30 - i'm like what are your goals for it he
95:32 - goes
95:33 - minimum that business needs to make
95:35 - twenty thousand dollars
95:37 - i said okay i didn't say much to him
95:41 - but first of all do you know how hard it
95:44 - is to open a [ __ ] business just in
95:46 - the first place just opening a business
95:47 - then second do you know how hard it
95:49 - [ __ ] is to actually make money from
95:51 - your business
95:52 - it's ridiculously hard and twenty
95:55 - thousand
95:56 - first it's like an it's uh unless you're
95:58 - a pro
95:59 - at doing business it's it's like a
96:01 - almost impossible task it's
96:03 - a ridiculously difficult task to be able
96:05 - to hit that role
96:09 - what do you think he's done when he has
96:11 - set up the rules for his happiness what
96:14 - do you think he's done to his happiness
96:16 - what percentage has he left
96:20 - to being truly happy right it's like
96:24 - in almost invisible right it's like the
96:26 - tiniest percentage of being happy
96:30 - and there's 99 or room for him to be
96:33 - unhappy so
96:34 - for example let's say on day 10 of his
96:36 - business he made a first hundred dollars
96:38 - which he should have been celebrating
96:39 - like crazy what do you think he was
96:41 - doing
96:43 - sad depressed feeling defeated feeling
96:46 - like
96:46 - underachiever feeling like he could
96:48 - never be good enough do you think that
96:50 - that's gonna inspire him
96:52 - to work harder now to go towards the 20
96:55 - 000 goal that he had set
97:00 - so expectations my friend
97:03 - are everything mindset is every goddamn
97:06 - thing when it comes to
97:08 - all of it youtube what like you want to
97:10 - grow your tick tock you want to grow
97:12 - your business whatever it is
97:13 - expectations have to be in reality
97:15 - expect to just
97:17 - [ __ ] suck go through the sunk and
97:20 - then you will eventually win just
97:22 - be aware of that when you're a new coder
97:24 - or a new developer
97:25 - most of the times your code is throwing
97:27 - errors when you are new to doing video
97:30 - production
97:31 - most of the times your battery is
97:32 - running out and you didn't even know you
97:33 - [ __ ] forgot to hit the record button
97:36 - expect to lose everything that's not a
97:39 - loss is a gift
97:41 - please see it like that please see it
97:43 - like that
97:44 - everything that's not a loss is a gift
97:48 - is a [ __ ] gift all right so please
97:51 - expectations mindset i can't emphasize
97:54 - that enough that's everything
97:56 - um okay let me see
97:59 - what what's going on here celebrate
98:03 - small wins yes half practical goals
98:05 - that's what made you what you're what
98:07 - you are today there's so much and
98:09 - learn we're all in this together
98:10 - beautiful
98:12 - comfort is the enemy of success our
98:15 - generation is too comfortable
98:17 - uh how long should each video qazi needs
98:20 - a hug that story is rough
98:22 - uh yeah man i love hugs bro carl
98:25 - so great question he says how long
98:28 - should
98:30 - let me see this
98:33 - how long should each uh each
98:36 - video be i say as long as it needs to be
98:39 - okay
98:40 - so if you want to say something that's
98:41 - longer go for it say it in a longer
98:43 - format
98:49 - [Music]
98:52 - all right howell ferreira says my fears
98:56 - to leave my job to focus fully on
98:57 - youtube
98:58 - videos with bills to pay it's hard to
98:59 - take that step can you give any tips on
99:00 - this
99:01 - don't leave your job make [ __ ]
99:02 - youtube videos i don't
99:04 - i don't know why people think they just
99:05 - need to leave their jobs right this
99:07 - second to make their content
99:09 - um you can make your content while
99:12 - you're while you're at your job and i
99:14 - think that's a very practical way to do
99:16 - it
99:17 - right i grew my entire channel in a one
99:21 - hour window every day
99:22 - so uh you can do that okay so make your
99:25 - video
99:26 - on your lunch break that's brilliant
99:27 - what frankie just said literally make it
99:29 - on your lunch break make it when you get
99:30 - home
99:31 - you need more no more than 30 minutes
99:34 - put the camera on your face put your
99:35 - phone on your face and just say your
99:36 - truth
99:37 - say something that is truly happening in
99:39 - your life uh
99:40 - and you will have a video my friend
99:44 - uh is there any sort of engagement
99:46 - algorithm on youtube the way there
99:47 - is with instagram melanie great question
99:50 - honestly
99:50 - the best algorithm the number one most
99:52 - important algorithm on youtube is
99:55 - watch time all right so
99:58 - the only thing i want you to focus on is
100:01 - title thumbnail and the video
100:05 - if you just focus on that you will win
100:07 - you don't need to go to other peop 50
100:09 - other youtube pages and leave comments
100:11 - there
100:11 - you can do that but i don't recommend it
100:13 - i don't like it
100:14 - i don't do it so i'll recommend you guys
100:17 - what i like i like making good [ __ ]
100:19 - content
100:20 - i like focusing on title and thumbnail
100:22 - and then i just like
100:23 - letting the universe go from there and
100:26 - 99.99 of the times it works
100:30 - um so how to get content ideas and
100:34 - keyword research for them i keep it very
100:36 - very simple
100:38 - i here's my research process okay you
100:40 - guys want to see my research process
100:42 - i'll show you guys so let's say i want
100:44 - to make a video on
100:45 - um give me a topic
100:51 - sure so let's say i want to make a video
100:53 - on like how to make money online right i
100:55 - will literally type how to make money
100:57 - online and i'll hit enter and then i'll
100:59 - just go through this
101:00 - okay so how to make 150 a day
101:04 - earn 500 best way to make money online
101:07 - as a beginner 21 hours ago how to make
101:11 - money online in 2020 the three best side
101:13 - hustles
101:14 - all right cool so now i've got my ideas
101:17 - uh well another thing i want to look at
101:19 - is are these videos
101:21 - recent and they're gaining viewership
101:23 - then that's a great sign so this is a
101:24 - recent video
101:26 - not that one um
101:29 - this one right 21 hours ago got 10 000
101:32 - views
101:32 - best way to make money online is a bro
101:35 - as a broke beginner
101:36 - okay so i might keep it pretty similar
101:39 - to this title
101:40 - and i might just go with that so that's
101:42 - honestly that's all the research i do
101:44 - right when even when i'm doing like
101:46 - best when i want to make a video best
101:48 - programming languages
101:50 - click it and just see all right top
101:52 - programming language of 2020
101:54 - the best programming language to learn
101:55 - in 2020 top five programming language
101:58 - okay
101:59 - and i'll pick one style and then i'll
102:01 - just go from there
102:02 - that's as fancy as my research ever gets
102:05 - you can get fancier than this but like i
102:08 - don't i mean
102:09 - i never needed to but and i don't really
102:11 - think you really need to
102:14 - um
102:18 - all right
102:22 - uh eric hodges how do you handle the
102:24 - feeling of being defeated i think i
102:25 - answered that question
102:26 - i went pretty deep into that is by
102:29 - defeating
102:31 - is by making that your default expecting
102:33 - defeat all the time
102:34 - but working like you're 50 points down
102:37 - and just working your ass off
102:38 - then everything is upside uh
102:41 - here's the hack for that so
102:45 - right if
102:48 - if i have my expectations set to like
102:52 - um you know i don't know like let's say
102:54 - that there's a you know you guys saw my
102:56 - youtube growth it looks like
102:57 - nothing is happening nothing is
102:58 - happening nothing is happening and then
103:00 - like
103:00 - [ __ ] boom if i have my expectations
103:03 - set to here
103:05 - then what happens day one when i'm here
103:08 - does it feel like a win or a loss
103:10 - it's a loss i'll put an l what happens
103:12 - day two
103:13 - when i'm here does it feel like a win or
103:15 - a loss feels like a loss what happens
103:17 - day three
103:18 - does it feel like a winner or a loss
103:20 - it's a loss
103:21 - loss loss so do you think i'm gonna make
103:25 - it to this part
103:27 - no i'm gonna quit on probably day seven
103:31 - because every day was a loss now i'll
103:34 - tell you how it [ __ ] works in my head
103:37 - and
103:38 - i'm almost not kidding i'm kind of like
103:40 - psychotic with this [ __ ]
103:42 - um make the best possible video i can on
103:46 - day one
103:49 - expect here's my expectation expect
103:52 - negative views it's [ __ ] crazy i know
103:55 - it doesn't even sound like a real thing
103:57 - literally accept like negative because
104:00 - if i suck
104:00 - i should really get negative views or
104:02 - something okay expect
104:05 - negative views and like 20 down votes
104:07 - that's my expectation
104:09 - negative let's just say negative 20 down
104:12 - votes
104:13 - that's my expectation
104:16 - right so this right here is my
104:19 - expectation
104:20 - so what happens on day one when i get
104:22 - zero views and let me drop a video
104:24 - day one is it a win or a loss
104:27 - so when what happens day two is this a
104:30 - winner or a loss i got one view let's
104:32 - say this day
104:33 - so [ __ ] massive one you kidding me i
104:36 - didn't get 20 down votes
104:37 - didn't make fun of me for my you know
104:40 - like
104:41 - everything that they used to make fun of
104:42 - me for my teeth and my [ __ ]
104:45 - accent that i had and um
104:49 - what happens day three it's a win what
104:51 - happens when i get two subscribers today

104:57 - make it to
104:58 - day whatever day a day um

105:55 - content each day is a win
105:57 - yes exactly yes
106:00 - people often think i'm not ambitious
106:03 - because i
106:04 - set low goals get the [ __ ] out of here
106:07 - i don't set low goals i set low
106:10 - expectations i set no or

107:18 - it's between 70 to 100 bucks and yeti
107:20 - mic will be really good i forgot to
107:21 - mention you guys should get uh
107:22 - invest in a mic it's really helpful to
107:25 - invest in a mic
107:28 - all right how to get a partner like nas
107:30 - i made content for
107:32 - four years and nas then thought hey this
107:35 - is a cool guy he hit me up and we became
107:37 - partners
107:37 - so uh create content and you can find
107:41 - all types of people my girlfriend is my
107:42 - girlfriend um
107:44 - because i created content and she found
107:47 - my content and became my girlfriend like
107:48 - it's kind of crazy
107:50 - like everybody in my life that's like
107:51 - connected to me right now it's because i
107:52 - was like making videos and just saw it
107:54 - and then
107:55 - we got connected right like frankie
107:57 - who's here
107:58 - like almost everybody that's here
107:59 - connected to me through because they've
108:01 - seen my videos
108:04 - um when talking to the camera at the
108:07 - beginning of our journey do you
108:08 - recommend scripting free flowing or
108:10 - guidelining with keywords
108:12 - so i love guidelining with keywords
108:15 - meaning
108:15 - like having just some bullet points so
108:17 - for example if i'm about to make a video
108:20 - and let's say julio that you're about to
108:22 - make a video
108:24 - um oh [ __ ] what did i do
108:27 - uh okay so if you're about to make a
108:30 - video i would literally i would just be
108:32 - like
108:33 - oh wait this is gonna vanish
108:39 - all right there we go all right so you
108:41 - can you can just say
108:42 - uh you know
108:49 - last night dinner story
108:52 - so now this is one story that you could
108:54 - mention
108:56 - uh you could have hook which is in the
108:59 - first 30
109:00 - secs 30 seconds whatever you're gonna
109:03 - say
109:04 - uh up to you you're gonna have you know
109:07 - then
109:08 - call to action at the end subscribe to
109:11 - the channel whatever
109:12 - so like this can be an example just like
109:14 - two or three bullet points that guide
109:16 - you
109:17 - i feel like for me that's the best way
109:19 - to do it i don't like scripting out
109:20 - every word
109:22 - i like so between you can go between
109:25 - free flowing and guidelining
109:26 - if guidelining helps you do it i'm just
109:28 - telling you this because in the start of
109:29 - my video sometimes i would guideline
109:31 - my videos where i'm just talking about
109:32 - those trainings and tutorials that just
109:34 - free flowed
109:35 - so both work really well
109:38 - i rarely ever do complete scripting i
109:41 - rarely ever do that but i've seen people
109:43 - do that and it works really well
109:45 - when it works
109:49 - what would you say was one of your best
109:50 - moments when you
109:52 - starting your business slash youtube
109:54 - channel
109:55 - the day that i got two subscribers
109:58 - the day that i got a hundred thousand
110:00 - subscribers
110:01 - the day that we cleared our first one
110:05 - million dollars
110:08 - um
110:11 - yeah i think those were like some of the
110:13 - greatest moments and like we were
110:15 - screaming and yelling and just
110:17 - laughing and uh those were some of the
110:20 - great moments
110:20 - other great moments were like going to a
110:23 - pretty awesome airbnb with the team and
110:25 - being in the hot tub
110:27 - outdoors talking about the vision of the
110:30 - business
110:31 - from like 12 a.m to 7 00 am it was
110:34 - freezing [ __ ] cold
110:36 - in the winter that was another amazing
110:38 - like there are just a lot of amazing
110:40 - moments and memories that we created
110:42 - along the way
110:48 - quality over quantity what are your
110:50 - thoughts
110:51 - most of the times the [ __ ] that you're
110:53 - gonna make is gonna suck
110:54 - so the way to get better at quality is
110:58 - through
110:58 - quantity and so
111:01 - the secret that i say i use the word
111:04 - quality that's what you gotta do
111:08 - so produce more it'll help you get
111:11 - better a lot faster
111:14 - what is better working out seven days a
111:16 - week or one day a week
111:18 - seven days a week what is what will make
111:20 - you a better martial artist
111:22 - we're uh doing martial arts for seven
111:23 - days a week or one day a week
111:25 - what will make you a better dancer
111:27 - dancing seven days a week or one day a
111:28 - week
111:29 - right like brian you're a dancer if i
111:33 - wanted to learn dance
111:34 - i'm going to be like quality over
111:36 - quantity like what do you think like
111:38 - i'm thinking i dance half a day out of a
111:40 - month
111:41 - but like really plan it out you know
111:43 - what i'm saying like plan it out like
111:45 - map it out like really think about it
111:48 - watch videos
111:49 - because let's be honest i got to be you
111:51 - know how i do with quality
111:52 - so you better believe that it's gonna be
111:55 - a quality dance i've never danced before
111:58 - but it's gonna be quality and you
111:59 - [ __ ] know it so let me think about
112:02 - it right i'm gonna map it out i'm gonna
112:03 - plan it out and spend a few weeks and
112:05 - then i'll
112:06 - dance for half an hour and then because
112:09 - quality
112:10 - that's the essential thing that happens
112:12 - here for people
112:14 - they just think that they'll magically
112:16 - create quality content if they just
112:18 - procrastinate for like ungodly amounts
112:20 - of time in between
112:22 - so the secret is remove that time
112:24 - produce
112:25 - on almost a daily basis you through the
112:28 - sheer
112:28 - quantity you will develop quality and
112:30 - stop asking questions over and over
112:32 - again
112:32 - it's the fastest way to get blocked
112:37 - um delete
112:40 - comment and remove author delete
112:44 - everything okay peace so keep it clean
112:47 - guys
112:47 - otherwise you're not gonna be a part of
112:49 - this community thank you
112:51 - um all right so olivia says yes you
112:55 - don't want to be robotic be yourself or
112:57 - it's going to get tiring and you'll lose
112:58 - interest
113:00 - i mean you can script pretty natural
113:02 - language type of stuff too but
113:04 - it's just it's tricky all right when i
113:07 - shoot hundred days of code like a log
113:08 - should i post on youtube daily or weekly
113:12 - um
113:15 - yeah you can shoot
113:19 - either or honestly you'll be fine brian
113:22 - says good point i love it
113:23 - we have to celebrate our winning yup
113:27 - 40 to 80 videos up would love to get
113:29 - your feedback on my channel
113:31 - arp on codes but not getting many views
113:34 - nice okay
113:38 - cool
113:43 - all right let's go
113:48 - i would work a little bit more on the
113:51 - thumbnails just a little bit
113:55 - so let's think about this there's a lot
113:57 - going on in your thumbnail so try to
113:59 - avoid this this is a common mistake
114:01 - people make
114:02 - get a okay hold on
114:06 - get a free t-shirt hacktoberfest
114:09 - two easy pull requests what the [ __ ] is
114:11 - going on like there's a lot going on in
114:13 - here
114:14 - so it's just like tomb all about open
114:17 - source contribution and like
114:19 - there's like 10 different thoughts
114:21 - happening here so it's really hard
114:23 - this is way better of a thumbnail it's
114:25 - just very clean
114:27 - and like this is what's happening okay
114:30 - i'm gonna go to this video
114:32 - hey guys so welcome to the second
114:34 - episode of getting started with where we
114:36 - take
114:36 - new technologies in every video and try
114:39 - to you know
114:40 - get started with it so in this video
114:43 - we'll be looking at
114:44 - a react-based framework next
114:47 - js okay so it's built upon react
114:52 - okay so a few things get started so i am
114:55 - at the
114:55 - that was cool how you did that the and
114:57 - it cut nice
114:59 - i think that because your camera quality
115:02 - is a little like
115:04 - i mean you literally are shooting with
115:05 - your phone or something
115:07 - because i can see all this so it looks a
115:08 - little funny
115:10 - i think that your intro is kind of it's
115:12 - to the point but what i would do is
115:14 - literally like
115:15 - one second in and i would switch to the
115:17 - screen until you get a really good
115:19 - camera and audio
115:20 - like one second and i'll switch to this
115:22 - the official website of
115:25 - framework next now it should have
115:28 - two right
115:31 - if it didn't work make sure you restart
115:33 - the development server when you add
115:35 - so energy needs to be up dude you're
115:37 - like losing me because you're getting
115:39 - tired
115:40 - so you won't be able
115:44 - okay yeah like you haven't prepared
115:48 - properly for this
115:49 - and you're like going through it and so
115:51 - like you're losing me because you're
115:52 - you're doing this so this is
115:54 - uh this is really a lot about energy
115:57 - okay so for example
115:58 - right now into the we are like two hours
116:02 - in right but you guys see and hear and
116:04 - feel my energy
116:05 - drop in the comments below if you do so
116:08 - why is this energy happening you have to
116:10 - work on it and you have to
116:11 - [ __ ] pull the entire way if you're
116:15 - gonna be making
116:16 - long streams all right so this is two
116:19 - hours and 20 minutes long
116:21 - we've made really long streams on clever
116:24 - programmers so if i go
116:26 - um all videos like you'll see that we
116:29 - have like
116:30 - long streams but you see even from
116:33 - clever pro
116:34 - messages like you guys are doing
116:41 - right so make sure how about we do a
116:43 - challenge and we can just
116:45 - so keep your energy high throughout
116:48 - the video so that's one big tip i will
116:51 - recommend to you because your watch time
116:52 - is gonna drop and youtube is gonna stop
116:54 - recommending this video because i'm
116:56 - losing you're like
116:58 - [Music]
117:01 - let's check out this page so like and
117:03 - also on your own prep you haven't
117:05 - prepped for this before that's why
117:07 - you're not moving through it's [ __ ]
117:08 - fast and confidently should be like
117:10 - guys we're on next.js like literally if
117:13 - you
117:13 - are talking about next.js like guys
117:17 - we're going to learn about next.js and
117:19 - here's the few
117:20 - main important tell you one image
117:22 - optimization two
117:23 - internalization three nextgs analytics
117:26 - so let's click into analytics now you
117:28 - got a score of 95 here and
117:30 - move through it fast and prep for it
117:34 - beforehand
117:34 - until you have a lot of practice to be
117:36 - able to just completely do it live
117:38 - so the one big tip i would give is like
117:40 - a lot about energy
117:42 - and keeping really high energy or
117:46 - edit the [ __ ] out of the video those are
117:48 - your two ways to do it
117:50 - i like to just work on my energy because
117:52 - then it saves me a lot of time so i can
117:54 - be lazy on the editing
117:56 - all right so i would have way higher
117:59 - energy because i think the content
118:00 - you're sharing is good
118:02 - i just think that like because of under
118:04 - preparation and lack of energy one
118:06 - you're wasting my time
118:08 - two you are not keeping me entertained
118:12 - you gotta be a [ __ ] entertainer so
118:14 - you gotta entertain me through the way
118:16 - and you gotta use your energy to push
118:17 - through
118:18 - if you don't have energy then edit the
118:20 - [ __ ] out of your videos and you will
118:21 - blow up
118:22 - i'll give you an example fireship has a
118:25 - great channel on coding
118:27 - he has no energy he speaks like the most
118:31 - monotonous speaking i've ever seen on
118:33 - the planet
118:34 - but he [ __ ] keeps his video tight so
118:36 - like it has 81 000 views so if you click
118:39 - on it user authentication there are two
118:40 - main ways to get the job done
118:42 - sessions and tokens the traditional
118:44 - approach on the web is cookie based
118:46 - server side sessions the process begins
118:48 - with a user filling out their username
118:50 - and password and then submitting it to a
118:51 - server which then validates it creates a
118:54 - session in the database
118:55 - then responds with a session id the
118:56 - session id will be saved in the
118:58 - browser's cookie jar which is a place in
119:00 - the browser to say
119:01 - see what i'm saying so like here
119:05 - it's blowing up his face is not even in
119:08 - here but he's edited
119:10 - it really well he worked on a script
119:13 - and he edited it really well and then he
119:15 - got a video that just banged
119:17 - and it's crushing so that's what i would
119:20 - say
119:21 - um and then of course like work on some
119:23 - titles that are like truly really
119:25 - popular because
119:26 - there's only about a few videos that
119:28 - really make your channel blow up
119:30 - so work on those all right cool
119:38 - um eric thread says i also hear you're
119:41 - swearing a lot i don't think that is too
119:42 - good i know some people are more picky
119:44 - about stuff like that
119:46 - yes but those aren't my people so that's
119:49 - another thing i want to share with you
119:50 - guys
119:51 - that not everyone is your people so
119:53 - don't try to just
119:54 - fit and mold yourself into that if that
119:57 - is not for
119:58 - you then that is not for you but on my
120:00 - channel where i'm gonna be talking for
120:02 - [ __ ] years not gonna be talking like
120:06 - how i don't actually talk in real life
120:08 - that's the number one way to make my
120:10 - life hard
120:11 - and miserable and make me not want to
120:14 - produce content
120:15 - right because i'm like oh [ __ ] can't cur
120:19 - like literally i'll be like oh [ __ ] i
120:20 - said [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] i
120:22 - [ __ ] up so like it doesn't matter guys
120:26 - what's important is how's your intent if
120:29 - my intent
120:30 - is i'm demeaning to somebody or i'm
120:32 - demoralizing somebody
120:33 - that's the real problem that's the
120:35 - culprit but if that's your way of
120:38 - speaking
120:39 - that's how you speak and you talk and
120:42 - you're just passionate that's okay right
120:45 - it's just where is your intention coming
120:46 - from
120:48 - christian said yokazi would love you
120:49 - give me some feedback okay dope fine
120:51 - line
120:52 - games top-notch programmer thanks a lot
120:54 - raf
120:55 - rafi we'll be back with more energy
120:58 - scripting can help with the
121:00 - scripting and editing can make it really
121:02 - tight and dialed
121:03 - in all right
121:06 - it can make it like really like a video
121:08 - really really tight
121:09 - if you can script it um if you guys
121:12 - don't have naturally amazing energy
121:14 - follow people like farmership and follow
121:17 - people like
121:17 - uh parker walbeck on youtube he's also
121:21 - very very
121:22 - low energy but he just has everything
121:24 - really tight
121:25 - and scripted and so it just goes really
121:27 - well
121:29 - uh any tips for dealing with the feeling
121:30 - of credibility have to talk about this
121:33 - that's just internal fears man and
121:35 - there's really not much i can say to
121:36 - change that for you
121:38 - i started my youtube channel when i was
121:40 - a complete beginner in coding and i
121:41 - actually didn't know that much about
121:42 - coding
121:43 - and i just started sharing every day i
121:44 - learned something i just shared it so
121:46 - every day you share something you look
121:48 - you learn something you share it you're
121:49 - winning
121:52 - uh
121:55 - all right cool so i'm loving that you
121:57 - guys are about to post your videos
121:58 - let's go and take a look at this one as
122:02 - well
122:06 - nice so these are like really popular
122:08 - titles i like it
122:12 - two years ago okay
122:17 - what is happening here new video games
122:21 - every saturday
122:22 - okay
122:27 - new video every saturday okay
122:30 - so what is this channel about
122:37 - i imagine it's somebody playing video
122:39 - games okay
122:41 - let's click most popular so this is the
122:43 - most popular
122:49 - [Music]
122:58 - um so a few things i would uh
123:02 - make the screen full screen first of all
123:05 - so
123:05 - shoot it in a way where it's not like
123:07 - this is tick tock content this is not
123:08 - necessarily for youtube
123:13 - okay i don't know what's going on there
123:14 - bro
123:20 - yeah so i would i mean this requires
123:22 - some work bro
123:23 - um i think if you're gaming just make
123:26 - sure your at least your quality is good
123:28 - i can see you i can hear you clearly i
123:30 - think like that's another thing that is
123:31 - frustrating for people if they can't
123:33 - hear you clearly
123:37 - yeah so audio quality and video quality
123:39 - is like the next
123:40 - really important thing for you um
123:44 - you can work on your energy too like
123:47 - yeah i think energy needs work
123:49 - uh again i've seen people blow up with
123:52 - way less energy so
123:53 - if it's not going to be the energy at
123:55 - least make sure your video quality is
123:57 - good because i don't feel like following
123:58 - your [ __ ] because it's like
124:00 - i don't like how it sounds and how it
124:02 - looks
124:09 - i mean yeah dude like so if you're gonna
124:12 - be a video game streamer you got to
124:14 - actually make content that i would
124:16 - want to just watch i i don't even know
124:19 - what it
124:20 - don't really know what's happening here
