00:00 - day three no day four of the javascript
00:03 - challenge
00:04 - and today we are finishing up the amazon
00:06 - clone
00:07 - 2.0 i want to show you what it is that
00:10 - we're doing right
00:11 - so we've got the amazon clone 2.0 that
00:14 - is built with javascript tail and css
00:16 - it is built with firebase it is built
00:20 - with media queries it is built
00:23 - with an amazing design we've got here
00:26 - categories right here
00:28 - okay so once you at some point when you
00:31 - when you click on the category your
00:33 - product should actually change
00:34 - you've got products right here okay
00:37 - these are the products that are
00:38 - available on amazon
00:40 - we've got ourselves the amazon logo we
00:42 - got ourselves the categories okay
00:44 - we have ourselves a search bar now
00:47 - here's the cool part i want you to pay
00:48 - attention to this really quickly guys
00:49 - okay
00:50 - pay attention to this this is so cool
00:52 - when you go ahead and click okay you see
00:54 - this
00:54 - number 50 right here i want you to pay
00:56 - attention to this number 50 right here
00:58 - let me make this a little bit bigger
01:00 - if you click on this add to cart which
01:01 - i'm going to do right now pay attention
01:03 - oh look
01:05 - the 5354 changes by itself by the way
01:08 - right this is
01:09 - live reload now libraries about live
01:11 - database
01:12 - right that's right and now if i go ahead
01:14 - and click on the cart
01:16 - right now we can see that what do we
01:18 - have we have
01:19 - 29 macbook pros which is pretty
01:21 - impressive
01:22 - i'm guessing if you want to win on
01:24 - macbook pro stick around guys because
01:26 - we'll show you how to make them work
01:27 - okay
01:29 - there's 15 nintendo switches in here
01:31 - there's 11 panasonic's
01:33 - that's right that's a lot of tech guys
01:34 - that's 53 000
01:36 - guys that's a lot that would be good
01:37 - giveaways for the challenge you know
01:39 - okay let's not promise that we can't we
01:41 - can't do that it's a lot it's a lot
01:45 - but right as you can see for example if
01:48 - i decrease the number here it decreases
01:50 - the whole total cost
01:51 - not only does this decrease this
01:53 - decreases and so does this
01:55 - so if i just simply right it'll work
01:58 - perfectly if i could increase the number
02:00 - if i wanted to as well look at that it
02:01 - looks or just works seamlessly
02:03 - if i now remove something which i can
02:06 - it's gone
02:07 - i can move another one it's gone now
02:09 - it's just fifty fifteen thousand
02:11 - it all works live so
02:14 - let's go ahead and build this together
02:16 - let's finish it up remember
02:18 - part one of this amazon clone was in the
02:20 - previous video so make sure
02:22 - if you are just here to start out uh
02:24 - feel free to
02:25 - check out the videos before uh they will
02:27 - be there
02:28 - but if you're here just also watch feel
02:29 - free to watch those you can zoom
02:31 - thank you guys let's go ahead and make
02:32 - sure we have our project uh
02:35 - open and we'll get started right now
02:37 - okay
02:38 - so right now before we start can you get
02:41 - push everything for the final project
02:44 - oh you got it jesse thank you
02:47 - i'm gonna get push everything because
02:48 - jesse wants me to get push stuff so i'm
02:50 - going to say
02:52 - sudo this is this is github by the way
02:54 - if you guys don't know so for example if
02:56 - i want to
02:57 - use git and i want to go ahead and
03:00 - you know add something to commit i do
03:03 - sudo git add
03:04 - dot and this by the way is just old code
03:07 - not out code but this is called the me
03:08 - and js i've been working on
03:10 - and then if i want to commit something i
03:11 - do sudo git
03:13 - commit dash m okay and then i give it a
03:17 - message so for example
03:18 - here this is day four day four of the
03:20 - challenge
03:21 - right boom boom right there and so
03:24 - sudoku ad is like kind of staging
03:26 - the changes they're not committed yet
03:28 - but they're staging the chain again
03:29 - getting it ready
03:30 - and then we do pseudokit commit we
03:33 - actually fully commit that
03:34 - you know uh that piece of code and then
03:36 - i can do sudo
03:38 - get i'm only using sudo because of my
03:40 - computer it's a little bit dumb right
03:41 - now
03:42 - so to get push origin master
03:46 - and boom right so what does it mean
03:49 - origin by the way origin master so
03:50 - a few things we push now to github this
03:53 - is what it means when we push to github
03:55 - uh basically we're going to push to
03:58 - origin which origin is
04:00 - where github is okay and then master
04:03 - is the branch that we're going to push
04:06 - so our
04:07 - branch we're going to push is called
04:08 - master and then we're going to push it
04:10 - to github okay
04:12 - and that's it all right jesse you got it
04:15 - yes awesome so guys
04:17 - this is really important git github is
04:20 - something you definitely need when
04:21 - you're working a team
04:23 - okay so because nash push and commit
04:25 - everything
04:26 - to get i'm now able to pull it
04:29 - from git and then and i only have to do
04:31 - i only have to go into the project
04:33 - and basically do the command uh git
04:37 - pull and that's it i'll get everything
04:40 - all of the code all the changes that we
04:41 - made that's right
04:43 - all right so let's go ahead and get
04:44 - started right away i'm going to close up
04:46 - my other vs code and i'm going to open
04:48 - up a recent one which is the one we're
04:50 - working on which is amazon clone 2.
04:51 - now all of you guys that are currently
04:53 - on zoom
04:54 - raise your hand if you have the amazon
04:56 - clone 2 if you have the up-to-date
04:58 - uh functionality do you guys have that
05:01 - yes or no
05:02 - you guys have the update functionality
05:04 - yes or no you guys have that yes yes yes
05:06 - yes

05:16 - so that we can tell show everybody the
05:18 - github link and they can download it
05:20 - okay but if we go ahead and i'm going to
05:23 - open up the current one so
05:25 - open with live server
05:28 - all right this is our current one you
05:31 - see look it looks pretty good i kind of
05:33 - like it i kind of like it a lot
05:35 - uh but of course it doesn't have the
05:36 - functionality that we talked about right
05:38 - we can't delete we can't you know add
05:40 - the card
05:41 - pretty much none of that stuff um but
05:44 - this is how now we're gonna make that
05:46 - all work so i'm
05:47 - let me go ahead and open up new window
05:49 - here just for me that's not for you guys
05:51 - okay for me actually
05:53 - because i want to see some of the code
05:54 - that i have as just kind of honestly as
05:57 - a
05:57 - uh as a cheat sheet i like to use a
06:00 - cheat sheet all the time
06:02 - don't judge me that's right we're not
06:05 - perfect okay
06:06 - okay nobody's perfect guys but
06:09 - um it's okay all right so part one
06:13 - where are we at well we first need to go
06:16 - ahead and do a few things
06:18 - if i go to amazon 2.0 let me go back to
06:21 - my index.html
06:23 - all right right we have this number one
06:27 - right here this counter
06:28 - it's just kind of there but if i go to
06:30 - the cart that counter is not there so
06:32 - let's
06:32 - first make sure that that counter is
06:34 - there okay and the counter is going to
06:36 - come from where let me go ahead and hide
06:37 - this for you guys
06:40 - hide this for you if i go to insta html
06:43 - you can see that
06:44 - we have a counter let me see let me see
06:46 - let me see
06:48 - it is a counter two two two two
06:51 - no not this one it's in the header
06:53 - somewhere
06:54 - card icon and we have this right there
06:57 - card item number you see that right
06:58 - there
06:58 - cart item number right there this one
07:00 - right here and it's right
07:02 - underneath the card icon so make sure
07:04 - you pay attention to that guys please
07:05 - pay attention that's really important
07:07 - all right
07:08 - card icon i'm going to copy the whole
07:10 - card item number i'll paste it even for
07:12 - you guys
07:12 - in the chat so you guys have it as well
07:14 - okay
07:17 - right there right there this is the one
07:19 - okay
07:22 - okay i'll place it for you guys in the
07:23 - chat and then what you guys want to do
07:25 - is let's go
07:26 - back to you know our file pages go back
07:30 - to card.html
07:32 - and then let's go ahead and put that in
07:34 - where put them near the card icon
07:36 - so if i simply just do command f and i
07:38 - say cart
07:40 - dash icon boom you see
07:43 - it show me the card icon is where it's
07:45 - at i'm going to
07:46 - hit enter paste it in there and boom
07:50 - we got it nice let's go and save that
07:54 - and then i'm going to give it a comment
07:56 - because sometimes i like to use comments
07:57 - it's very important guys okay pay
07:59 - attention to the way i'm doing this
08:01 - all right so we have cart icons
08:04 - boom right card icon
08:07 - all right so that way if i go ahead and
08:09 - save this
08:11 - save this in the html i don't exactly
08:14 - see it for some
08:15 - reason but why is that because i cannot
08:17 - okay
08:18 - the reason why i don't see is actually
08:19 - this is maybe why joe why you don't see
08:21 - it as well because
08:22 - right i put inside the card item number
08:25 - but the issue is
08:26 - where is it it's all the way here i
08:29 - don't know if you guys can see that it's
08:30 - right here you see that you need to do
08:34 - the positioning
08:35 - that's right because currently this
08:37 - little icon
08:38 - cutout number is position absolute but
08:42 - absolute to what so we need to give it a
08:44 - relative positioning for this specific
08:47 - dip that means i need to go back to my
08:49 - card icon
08:51 - i need to say relative using tailwind
08:54 - css
08:55 - and boom now it's there you see that joe
08:59 - make sure you have it just like that
09:00 - okay joe all right
09:03 - beautiful beautiful beautiful social
09:05 - relative so now we have that
09:07 - we've got that that's all looking great
09:10 - jesse what do you think this is the next
09:11 - thing that we should be working on
09:15 - so let's start at the start right when
09:18 - we are in the main section indeed
09:21 - when we're on the main section and we
09:22 - see one of those hot deals
09:25 - we want to buy that that's right so
09:29 - first let's start off with adding the
09:31 - button
09:32 - add to card okay and
09:36 - the logic is this guys when you click
09:37 - the button boom
09:39 - the item is in your cart so guess what
09:42 - the one
09:43 - becomes a two if you have two items so
09:46 - let's add all of that functionality
09:48 - and let's start here that's right so
09:50 - it's going to add added functionality
09:51 - for add to cart so
09:52 - if you go to in this.html let's scroll
09:55 - down and let's go to our product so we
09:56 - have one product right now which is this
09:58 - product
09:59 - right that's pretty much just just this
10:00 - product image and
10:02 - what do you think we should do in order
10:03 - to add another div
10:05 - for the cart well it's very simple i
10:08 - think we should add another deal for the
10:10 - card
10:10 - so i pretty much answer my question
10:15 - pun intended i know i know
10:18 - but that's okay it was very clear mm-hmm
10:21 - so let's go ahead and do that jesse you
10:22 - want to do that right you give me a
10:23 - lecture
10:24 - oh dang yeah if you can give me your
10:26 - life here i need to get thank you sure
10:27 - that's right
10:28 - jesse oh damn you fancy live here fancy
10:32 - jesse
10:33 - it's it's the share of life
10:39 - let me see start collaborating oh it's
10:42 - still starting so while
10:43 - starting collaboration sessions you give
10:45 - me please be patient with me for a
10:46 - second
10:47 - and while we're doing that let's kind of
10:48 - create a new div okay
10:50 - i'm gonna say dude i'm gonna say class
10:52 - and this is gonna be
10:56 - add to dash card right there
11:00 - okay add to cart so so guys look at this
11:04 - closely it's in the inside the hot deal
11:07 - okay so main sections deal see that it's
11:10 - inside the main product so
11:11 - it's inside this product this is one
11:13 - product guys and we're going to put a
11:15 - add to cart inside that product okay
11:18 - that's what we're going to do i'm going
11:19 - to create that div and then we're going
11:21 - to give it a few different
11:23 - uh things so this at the car should have
11:25 - a text of
11:26 - add to cart let's go and save that
11:29 - i can see by the way the bottom is
11:30 - showing right there you see
11:32 - right there okay then i'm gonna do a few
11:35 - things
11:36 - we're going to give the height so let's
11:37 - do h dash eight
11:39 - okay and let's do with dash 28
11:44 - boom nothing so far let's give it a
11:46 - background color and let's say
11:48 - bg bg yellow 500 so let's do this
11:53 - bg yellow 500
11:56 - save that okay all right and then we
11:59 - have a bg
12:00 - yellow 500 to fully make it centered
12:03 - what are we gonna do guys
12:04 - well we need to add a flex to it so
12:06 - let's do flex
12:08 - okay and let's do items center
12:12 - oops items dash center again this is
12:15 - going to
12:16 - uh do item center oh there we go now the
12:19 - link is getting copied nice job
12:20 - jesse hey send it to jesse here for a
12:24 - second
12:26 - there you go yeah yeah yeah
12:30 - so that's good so that means it's center
12:32 - uh horizontally
12:34 - and then let's do vertically so actually
12:36 - this is a vertical
12:37 - vertical actually i forgot about that
12:39 - and then let's do now
12:40 - justify center to center horizontally
12:46 - boom okay then we're going to do text
12:50 - white
12:52 - boom and then let's go ahead and do some
12:53 - rounded corners okay
12:55 - well to give us around the corners it's
12:56 - just gonna be um
12:58 - just say rounded that's it so let's do
13:02 - rounded save that i'm gonna give you
13:04 - guys a word wrap
13:06 - so you guys can see a little bit better
13:07 - here boom there we go
13:09 - you see all right okay
13:12 - we're all good there add to card justify
13:15 - center it's time to look and that's
13:16 - pretty much it that's the art at the
13:17 - card is pretty much done
13:19 - i just want to make the text a little
13:20 - bit bigger so we're going to do the text
13:22 - md text
13:26 - md save and
13:29 - that's it that is it my friends all
13:32 - right
13:32 - also i want to be able to make it a
13:34 - hover so when i hover over this it
13:36 - feels like it's a pointer it's a cursor
13:38 - pointer right so i'm going to give it a
13:40 - cursor pointer
13:43 - cursor dash pointer
13:47 - okay so that means if i wrote this you
13:49 - see it's like a hand button now so boom
13:56 - anyways right it's a cursor pointer and
13:58 - then the final thing is
14:00 - i want to add a hover so when i hover
14:02 - over over this whole thing
14:03 - i want to be able to change the color
14:05 - that means i'm going to say
14:07 - hover again this is all tail and css
14:10 - hover
14:10 - with i'm going to change the bg yellow
14:13 - to not
14:14 - b500 to actually be 600
14:17 - this is the really cool thing about
14:18 - telling css you can really add make this
14:20 - stuff so fast so for example if i just
14:22 - do this this this
14:23 - you see that's it it's already a hover
14:25 - and it's clickable and everything
14:26 - so bun done at the cart is now all
14:30 - done okay guys so now add to cart is
14:33 - add to cart is is done
14:37 - okay all right we've got that portion
14:39 - now what i want to do is actually i want
14:41 - to
14:42 - be able to add this at the card to
14:45 - a database but before i do that i want
14:48 - to be able to
14:50 - get the card items from my database guys
14:53 - because right now
14:54 - this is what let me go upstairs this
14:56 - right now is static
14:58 - this div is static it's not dependent
15:01 - any database
15:02 - it's not dependent on anything it's just
15:03 - a static html
15:05 - i want to be able to change that to
15:07 - where i get the data
15:09 - from the actual firebase database so
15:11 - let's go ahead and go to firebase right
15:12 - now okay guys
15:13 - everybody i went through firebase
15:15 - yesterday i'm gonna go through firebase
15:16 - again here

17:53 - well a few things we're going to go back
17:56 - into
17:57 - our project folder some of you might
18:00 - have fibro.js already here
18:02 - some you might not right if you don't
18:04 - have it do new file and say
18:06 - firebase firebase base.js
18:10 - dot gs sure right i already have it so i
18:14 - need to create it but that's it
18:15 - i have my firebase.js then what i'm
18:18 - going to do with this firebase gs is i'm
18:19 - going to copy everything that's from
18:21 - here
18:21 - this config command c that config
18:25 - and then command v that config right
18:27 - there okay
18:28 - that's it that's what i'm going to do
18:30 - right with this config
18:32 - then i'm pretty much done let's go to
18:35 - index.html
18:37 - i now need to import firebase into here
18:40 - so check this out i'm going to copy
18:43 - firebase app.js this script tag right
18:45 - here
18:46 - all right and you guys should all have
18:48 - that or if you don't i'm going to put it
18:50 - in the chat yeah
18:52 - boom right there and then put it is
18:54 - somewhere inside here so i'm going to
18:56 - say i'm going to put it in here right
18:57 - there see script tag
18:58 - firebase app
19:01 - then i'm going to copy this analytics
19:03 - portion which you really don't need but
19:04 - we'll just have it there for now
19:07 - and that's it and we're not done yet
19:09 - though honestly
19:10 - because i'm going to show you how to
19:11 - actually use the firestore because
19:13 - firebase is a lot of things
19:15 - firestore is the database that we're
19:16 - going to use so
19:19 - using firebase firestore
19:24 - okay so getting started with firestore
19:27 - let's go ahead and scroll down right
19:29 - there
19:30 - so with firestore it's telling you a few
19:32 - things right you need to
19:33 - import the actual firestore script right
19:36 - here you see we imported this one
19:38 - firebase
19:38 - app by the way jesse were you able to
19:41 - log in it's all good
19:42 - yeah okay great i'm labeled i just
19:44 - logged in now yeah okay great
19:45 - so i'm gonna go through this right now
19:47 - so firestore let's copy that i'm gonna
19:49 - put a few guys in the chat
19:51 - boom a month can we please um and
19:54 - include comments on youtube i want to
19:56 - make sure that we have comments on
19:58 - youtube
19:59 - command v on there okay
20:02 - so we have all these three different
20:04 - files we have one
20:05 - the initial firebase app that's the most
20:07 - important thing now you can see here i
20:09 - already have
20:10 - it there let's go ahead and delete that
20:12 - right now because i already have it
20:13 - there
20:14 - next one is we have the analytics
20:15 - portion i have that there too so i'm
20:17 - going to delete my second
20:19 - duplicate so i don't have i don't have a
20:20 - duplicate and the third one is going to
20:22 - be this firebase firestore
20:24 - so there's three things you need to
20:26 - include in your application in order to
20:27 - make the database
20:28 - work is everybody with it you guys
20:30 - understand that yes or no
20:33 - yeah good good all right so we got that
20:36 - and here you see it shows us hey you
20:38 - know the npm install all this kind of
20:40 - stuff but we're not going to do that
20:41 - instead
20:42 - we're going to do the following the one
20:44 - thing we're going to do is just simply
20:45 - do db
20:46 - firebase firestore so do that right now
20:48 - i'm going to save this
20:50 - okay and within that i'm going to create
20:54 - a new file
20:55 - called new file uh actually i'm going to
20:57 - go fibres.js
20:58 - and i'm going to say uh
21:02 - all right oh oop not the one that's not
21:04 - this one i'm going to copy this var db
21:06 - firebase firestore and this is going to
21:09 - make this db variable available to the
21:11 - whole index.html or the whole script.js
21:14 - when we're going to create this right
21:15 - now so
21:16 - oh that's right this db variable is
21:19 - going to be available everywhere that's
21:20 - why we're putting into like a var
21:22 - variable right
21:23 - because now if i do new file and i say
21:26 - script.js guys
21:28 - okay this is the actual script we're
21:31 - going to use to
21:32 - get the data from the firebase so now
21:34 - check this out
21:35 - all right really quickly
21:39 - i will go ahead and i will go to
21:40 - insta.html and i'm going to include my
21:42 - script.js inside
21:44 - here so let's do that right now script
21:48 - source is equal to
21:52 - script.js close it out boom and done
21:55 - right that's it you can see here is
21:58 - telling us hey how do we actually add
21:59 - the data you know how do we get the data
22:02 - like read the data so it's telling us
22:03 - right there right
22:05 - uh before we read the data from firebase
22:06 - let's actually add some
22:08 - items to the database because of course
22:10 - if we got nothing we're not
22:11 - we're going to get nothing simple as
22:13 - that i will go back to my
22:15 - uh firebase here right there oh not here
22:20 - close this one out i will continue to
22:22 - continue to console
22:24 - and i will go ahead and go to firestore
22:27 - database
22:28 - i will create my database i'm going to
22:31 - put into test mode for now
22:33 - just for now test mode click on next
22:37 - you can select the location wherever
22:39 - you're at so if you're in some other
22:40 - locations
22:41 - like this one i'm currently here in this
22:42 - u.s central so i will click enable
22:50 - that's right
23:04 - okay great so i'm going to start my
23:06 - first color so collection guys is a
23:08 - database right it's a database table
23:10 - that's how i think about it right a
23:11 - table
23:13 - what's a table anybody know what a table
23:15 - is
23:17 - anybody know what a table is raise your
23:18 - hand if you know the table is well it's
23:20 - kind of like this
23:21 - if i have this kind of table i can have
23:24 - rows of different data in here you see
23:28 - boom rows see and every single row is
23:32 - another item maybe this could be an item
23:34 - this could be an item this could be and
23:35 - this could be an item
23:36 - every single row has certain data maybe
23:39 - this could be the name
23:40 - this could be the image this could be
23:43 - you know
23:44 - maybe the url this could be the price
23:46 - and so forth and it continues on and
23:48 - every single row has the same
23:50 - data you see the same data now i know
23:53 - what i'm showing is very visual
23:55 - but let's convert it to actual uh data
23:58 - i will click start collection and i'm
24:00 - going to say
24:01 - i'm going to say items items
24:05 - next okay so now we're going to create
24:07 - our one our first row of data
24:09 - in our case is called a document we have
24:12 - a document id
24:13 - which basically is a unique id that
24:15 - represents that
24:16 - piece of item okay i'm just like
24:19 - i'm gonna say hey let's auto generate
24:21 - that id and now i'm gonna give the
24:23 - fields that i need so first field is
24:26 - gonna be what
24:28 - image okay it's a string and what is the
24:31 - value of the image well
24:33 - if i go back to my uh shopping cart oh
24:36 - that's not working there oh it's okay
24:38 - it's okay no okay
24:39 - it's okay i got it i'll put live server
24:42 - hey let's go see oh so quick oh no

24:52 - let me go and open this up with live
24:53 - server as well
24:55 - nice good good good the smell one so
24:57 - this is my other application
24:58 - i'm going to copy this image address and
25:01 - right here and again if it looks like
25:03 - here on youtube you can go ahead copy
25:04 - your image edges as well
25:05 - and maybe you can paste it in uh as well
25:07 - i might maybe keep pasting the image
25:09 - somewhere else as well so i'm going to
25:10 - paste the image for you guys right now
25:14 - boom it's there okay all right it's
25:16 - there
25:17 - and then i'm going to use that one all
25:20 - right
25:21 - and then i will go ahead and go to my
25:23 - amazon application
25:26 - my firebase and i'm going to paste that
25:28 - in here as well
25:29 - guys that's then we're going to add
25:30 - another field called name
25:32 - and this name is a very simple well it's
25:35 - apple macbook pro
25:39 - all right let's go back to our firebase
25:42 - right here

25:53 - the rating okay
25:56 - so we have the rating rating
26:00 - and you give it a number but let's not
26:02 - make it a string but make it a type
26:03 - number so i'm going to say 4.8
26:06 - now i'm going to do 5.0 because i love
26:07 - mac so don't hate me
26:12 - all right and then i'm gonna give you
26:13 - the price of 1149
26:15 - as well so let's go to uh firebase back
26:18 - we'll say price
26:20 - that's going to be a number and we'll do
26:23 - five uh two
26:24 - one thousand one forty nine again it's a
26:26 - number guys okay
26:27 - there's a difference between strings
26:30 - strings
26:31 - and numbers okay a string is just a kind
26:33 - of like a string like
26:34 - you know you can use a string like
26:36 - nazari or the actual word
26:38 - it's a word basically a number is a
26:39 - number right
26:41 - click save and check this out guys we
26:44 - have our first
26:45 - document in the collection this is our
26:47 - first row
26:48 - over from a database now how do we get
26:51 - the actual data and let me know if
26:52 - you're still with me are you guys still
26:53 - with me kind of
26:56 - yeah you guys still with me somebody

27:02 - match up
27:03 - so we have this field right here that's
27:05 - awesome sweet
27:08 - so now what i'm going to do is i will go
27:10 - ahead and actually
27:12 - go to my amazon
27:15 - and let's see what we can do
27:18 - when we go to documentation you can see
27:20 - this is how we get the data
27:21 - give me the collection users.getdata so
27:23 - i'm actually going to copy this
27:25 - with the collection and i'm going to
27:27 - paste it in i'm not pasting it for you
27:28 - guys as well in the chat
27:31 - boom let's go to script.js and let's
27:34 - create a new function called
27:36 - function
27:39 - function get items
27:43 - okay so
27:46 - jesse can you explain to us what is a
27:47 - function
27:49 - so get items guys
27:53 - this function will get all of the items
27:56 - that are
27:57 - inside of firebase that nas just added
28:01 - so
28:03 - um what is a function but what is a
28:05 - function in general like what does a
28:06 - function do
28:07 - for some people who don't know what a
28:09 - function is in general
28:11 - what a function just in general yeah
28:13 - what is a function
28:14 - so here on line three guys
28:18 - this is called a function well actually
28:20 - more technical
28:21 - a function definition okay this is how
28:24 - you define the function
28:26 - and this function is called get items
28:30 - okay so what you call the with the
28:33 - keyword function
28:36 - you're saying basically to visual studio
28:38 - code
28:39 - hey the code is coming after that that's
28:42 - going to be a function
28:43 - so you're going to give that the name oh
28:45 - my light went out
28:47 - and you're going to give it round
28:48 - parentheses because that means
28:50 - it's a function okay then when you open
28:54 - up the brackets
28:55 - that means all of the code inside of
28:57 - those brackets
28:58 - are being executed when you call the
29:01 - function
29:02 - this code how do you call a function
29:06 - guess what very easy you just say
29:10 - get items
29:13 - parentheses yeah and you call whatever
29:15 - you want so if you wanna whatever you
29:17 - function this name you give
29:18 - that's the name you call here so if you
29:20 - wanna say hey get item
29:22 - or get random items yeah yeah for
29:24 - example if you call it say hello
29:26 - then this function also needs to be
29:28 - called say hello
29:29 - does that make sense guys with the exact
29:31 - same decks can i get a thumbnail from
29:33 - everybody
29:34 - good good good good good so let's go and
29:36 - change it to edit items now of course
29:37 - when we name functions we are very
29:39 - careful with how we name them because
29:41 - it tells us a lot about what the
29:42 - function is all about okay
29:45 - tells us a lot about that if we just
29:46 - name it randomly
29:48 - if we name it like this
29:50 - [Music]
29:52 - good luck understanding
29:59 - [Laughter]
30:02 - that's funny right there so look guys
30:06 - this is a function called get items and
30:07 - this item is we're doing a few things
30:10 - we have git items we're going to be the
30:13 - collection if we go to our firebase we
30:14 - have a collection called items you see
30:16 - right here
30:17 - so because of that what do you think
30:18 - needs to go inside here
30:20 - put in a chat guys what do you guys
30:21 - think needs to go inside here
30:23 - that's right items so users we're going
30:26 - to say
30:27 - items dot get that then there's gonna be
30:30 - query snapshot this is a function right
30:32 - here this itself is a function as well
30:34 - it's called an arrow function and then
30:37 - the query snapchat is actually just a
30:38 - list of something a list of items so if
30:40 - i do console.log
30:43 - query snapshot right i'm going to
30:47 - console.log here and i want to show you
30:48 - something so check this out
30:50 - before i'm going to count this out just
30:51 - so you can see it
30:53 - we're going to call this kit items now
30:55 - let's double check to make sure
30:56 - the script is inside it is html
31:00 - yep that's there that's all good so now
31:02 - if we open our amazon
31:04 - if we right click and expect element on
31:06 - here
31:09 - it says what db is not defined
31:15 - which is fine why do you think that's
31:16 - the case
31:19 - well i think it's the case why is it why
31:20 - do you think that's the case over db
31:22 - is not defined because we have a db
31:24 - right here
31:25 - db and then we have db inside
31:29 - here why is it the case what do you guys
31:31 - think
31:33 - i know why the ideas
31:37 - that's right maria we need to import db
31:39 - but because we're using just vanilla
31:41 - javascript
31:42 - for now that's right that means
31:45 - something is not
31:46 - connected you guys it's a good hunch
31:48 - because right now look at this
31:50 - it's firebase.js but are we including
31:54 - that
31:54 - that somewhere no
31:58 - if i look at my insta.html virus.js is
32:01 - normally be found in here
32:03 - you see it's nowhere so we need to
32:05 - include firebase.js i'm going to say
32:06 - script and we need to include it after
32:10 - we
32:10 - initialize firebase right here and we
32:13 - can include it before the actual
32:14 - script.js
32:16 - so you need to be careful on the actual
32:18 - in which order you put it
32:19 - in put it in so go to script source
32:23 - papa i'm going to say firebase.js
32:28 - save that there we go so now we have
32:30 - firebase.js in there which has the
32:32 - configuration file
32:34 - as well as the script.gs and now if we
32:36 - right click on this inspect element
32:40 - console oh see we don't have an error
32:44 - but we have a weird something it's like
32:46 - nm it's a delicate it's a fire star has
32:48 - dogs it's like a weird data you see that
32:51 - right it has got like a weird data
32:54 - right so well when i say about weird
32:58 - data what is the data well
32:59 - here's how it's going to work let's go
33:01 - back to script the gs
33:03 - all right what's going to happen is
33:06 - basically we have a query snapshot
33:08 - that's the query that's the actual
33:10 - the the data that we get from here
33:13 - we're going to loop through the query
33:15 - snapshot using it for each loop
33:17 - then we're going to update and showcase
33:19 - hey what is the id of the document
33:21 - and what is the data for that id because
33:23 - why
33:24 - if i go to my firebase this is how the
33:27 - documentation is telling us to use it
33:29 - the doc.id then dock the data this
33:32 - right here represents the actual id of
33:34 - the row
33:35 - element this is the actual data for that
33:39 - element okay let's save it
33:42 - let's go back to our amazon right click
33:45 - inspect element
33:47 - oh console oh
33:50 - look at that we my friends have got
33:54 - some data this is the idea of the actual
33:56 - data object the one that we showcased
33:58 - and this is the object guys that is it
34:01 - all right
34:01 - maybe you can also show it in the fire
34:03 - store nuts that's right so if i go to
34:05 - firestore
34:06 - here it is you see it says p7 p7gl
34:10 - that's the id the same data is going to
34:13 - be
34:13 - if i inspect element
34:17 - console right there gl
34:20 - so it's coming directly from the
34:22 - database
34:24 - that is so snapshot guys is basically
34:27 - making a snapshot of everything you have
34:30 - in your firestore
34:32 - and then looping through all of the
34:33 - documents all of the items that's right
34:35 - that's how you take a picture yeah by
34:38 - taking a picture
34:39 - click click click
34:44 - anyways right so there you go so we've
34:46 - got that okay we've got the data
34:48 - which is great right because we have we
34:49 - have this doc data that's all gray it's
34:51 - all it's all good and dandy
34:53 - but of course we're not done yet because
34:55 - now it comes the hard part we need to
34:57 - actually use something that's on the
34:58 - data well
34:59 - let's actually use the data we have the
35:00 - doctor data when you do first number one
35:04 - create the actual item so right
35:07 - let's do let items
35:10 - i'm going to say this in an array is
35:12 - equal to an empty array for now
35:15 - okay then when we are looping through
35:18 - this
35:20 - when we're looping through this i'm
35:22 - gonna do the following
35:24 - items dot push
35:27 - items.push right open up the parenthesis
35:32 - and what's going to happen is we're
35:33 - going to push an object into this array
35:36 - right and here's the object the first
35:38 - this object has an id
35:41 - of doc dot id comma
35:44 - and then this object has an image right
35:47 - here
35:48 - doc dot image oh two
35:52 - not duct id but dot data
35:56 - no yeah it is no that's right it's right
35:59 - that id
36:01 - dot data dot image
36:04 - right then we have what
36:08 - name so now we have donk dot
36:12 - data dot name you see we're grabbing all
36:16 - the data from the document
36:18 - that we got from the firebase then we
36:20 - have what
36:21 - we have um image name
36:24 - we have make doc
36:27 - dot data dot make
36:31 - comma what is the last one that we have
36:33 - guys reading
36:36 - okay this is what we have doc dot data
36:41 - right dot rating
36:46 - oh and one last one's gonna be price
36:49 - so price
36:54 - the doctor data the
36:57 - price oh that's a lot of properties
37:01 - there's a lot of properties guys you see
37:03 - we're grabbing the properties and so now
37:05 - if i let's take a look at it so now
37:06 - after we push all this let's console the
37:09 - console load the item so console.log
37:13 - items items
37:16 - boom right let's take a look at it right
37:18 - click inspect element
37:22 - console array oh
37:26 - look at that id make
37:29 - name price rating everything is
37:32 - right there you my friends have got it
37:35 - you see
37:36 - that's literally all we had to do right
37:38 - all we had to do guys
37:40 - that's it yeah right and now we're
37:41 - getting the data from i know
37:43 - from the database right that's it
37:45 - goodbye have a good day
37:48 - so guys now that we have the data
37:53 - what do we do with this data actually
37:56 - i'm really curious what you guys think
37:57 - here in the youtube chat yeah so
37:59 - let's see how because this is the logic
38:01 - of the app right
38:02 - so um your script the js is working
38:07 - once your index.html loads up okay so
38:10 - get items
38:11 - being called as you can see so the items
38:14 - are all getting retrieved from the
38:15 - firebase and then what
38:18 - we still don't see anything in the front
38:21 - end right
38:22 - what do you guys think what do you guys
38:24 - think
38:26 - put it in the chat
38:31 - anybody anybody having any idea buddy
38:35 - hey be an idea well okay
38:38 - basically now what we want to do is we
38:41 - want to
38:42 - take the items we have here and show
38:44 - them in the actual database
38:48 - see or show them in the actual html
38:51 - that's not going to be the hard part
38:53 - that's right samir
38:54 - show the linux index.html and this is
38:57 - where we're going to create a function
38:59 - and what should we call that function i
39:02 - think
39:02 - we should call it generate items
39:06 - okay and once we generate items guys
39:10 - what is the data that we need
39:13 - so what do we have to give as an
39:16 - argument
39:18 - well i think it's items jesse definitely
39:21 - items so this is the thing guys we have
39:24 - a function we want to call it a function
39:27 - called generate
39:28 - items and we give it an argument of
39:29 - items that said
39:31 - we got to of course make that function
39:35 - that's right let's call it
39:36 - again function
39:39 - boom generate items
39:43 - guess what takes one parameter now i'm
39:45 - going to call it different
39:47 - parameter okay so
39:50 - items and once we have items like nas
39:53 - said
39:54 - we have to loop through the items okay
39:56 - so items
39:57 - dot four each
40:00 - item arrow function bracket
40:03 - open because now i'm going to do
40:05 - something with each
40:07 - item
40:09 - [Music]
40:11 - what do we want to do with each item
40:12 - remember when we
40:15 - let me go back to index.html
40:22 - in the index.html remember we were
40:26 - in the main section deals correct
40:28 - [Music]
40:30 - right here main section products right
40:32 - here right exactly main section products
40:34 - that's right nice
40:35 - and as you can see each main product
40:39 - is actually the item that we're talking
40:41 - about
40:41 - [Music]
40:43 - so so there's actually there's actually
40:45 - two ways to do this jesse okay
40:47 - okay so one way to do this is going to
40:49 - be that we simply just put the html so
40:51 - let's take a look let's go and just test
40:53 - this out okay i want you guys to see
40:54 - here okay so look think about like this
40:57 - this is the html and i'm gonna
40:59 - use this html to put it using javascript
41:02 - just take a look at this i'm going to
41:04 - copy this whole thing
41:06 - okay copy pasta command
41:09 - c and and that's it let's go back to the
41:12 - gs
41:13 - the cool thing is here is the following
41:15 - i can do
41:16 - let items html
41:20 - okay and this is a really cool way to do
41:22 - to do using using vanilla javascript
41:24 - guys this is so
41:25 - cool right i'm going to loop through
41:28 - every single item
41:29 - and then for a single item i'm going to
41:31 - say item is html
41:34 - right plus equal to
41:38 - i'm going to use something called
41:39 - backticks they're called string literals
41:42 - right right here and then i'm going to
41:45 - use
41:46 - to paste the whole thing in that's
41:48 - exactly oh
41:49 - so you're going to concatenate you're
41:51 - going to paste it next
41:52 - that's right follow up to each other
41:54 - yeah that's right so i'm literally
41:56 - pasting the whole html
41:57 - but this is this can only be done if you
41:58 - use backticks be careful guys
42:00 - back ticks if you use normal quotes like
42:03 - this
42:04 - it's not going to work you have to use
42:06 - backticks and that's found on your
42:08 - keyboard somewhere on the left hand side
42:10 - right here
42:10 - on the corner right near the number one
42:13 - okay
42:13 - so you can do shift that one okay
42:16 - so back is our stream literals and what
42:18 - they allow us to do they allow us to
42:20 - kind of use a lot of things well
42:21 - the biggest thing allows to do is they
42:23 - allow us to switch this data out and
42:25 - actually use data we get from
42:27 - us a javascript object like item here
42:30 - so you can see right here she has item
42:32 - and then she's placing item.name
42:34 - into the actual text that's right
42:38 - then she's going to place item dot
42:41 - make into the actual text then she's
42:44 - gonna change the uh
42:45 - keep the stars there jesse no sorry
42:49 - okay just change the number change the
42:52 - number right here
42:55 - right there and the item.rating is going
42:57 - to change the price right here as well
43:00 - and that's going to call item.price you
43:02 - see
43:03 - that's right and that's it but it gets
43:05 - even better because
43:07 - then look at this what about the source
43:11 - well the source jesse right here right
43:14 - let's change under the source of the
43:15 - actual image jesse
43:18 - yeah yeah yeah this one here you can do
43:21 - the same thing again
43:22 - you can do boom that's right item
43:25 - dot image and the image again where's
43:28 - this all coming from because remember if
43:30 - i did console log of the items here
43:32 - right
43:32 - i do console.log
43:36 - log items right
43:40 - items i just want to show you so you
43:41 - guys can see it okay
43:43 - all right inspect element and this one
43:46 - console
43:48 - boom console array one
43:51 - what do you guys see right all this data
43:54 - and so this right here is one item okay
43:58 - and now what i'm what we're doing here
44:00 - is we're doing the following here this
44:01 - image
44:01 - is gonna go into here okay this make
44:05 - is gonna go into here hey this
44:08 - name it's gonna go into
44:12 - here hey this price is gonna go directly
44:15 - into
44:16 - here and then this rating gonna go
44:18 - directly into
44:20 - here do you see that yes or no right and
44:22 - that's it guys right
44:24 - and so because of that we've we're
44:25 - creating this html
44:28 - dinah makely dynamically
44:31 - all right and now and i want to add
44:35 - something to this by the way guys
44:36 - because the price
44:38 - is not just going to be number it needs
44:40 - a format of course
44:41 - okay so you can do that really easily in
44:43 - javascript but you can call you can
44:45 - use something called numeral we actually
44:48 - need to import the first gesture you
44:50 - need to import numeral first jesse
44:51 - oh right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
44:52 - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
44:53 - oh let's do that let's do it a little
44:54 - bit okay
44:55 - yeah okay let's do that later yeah yeah
44:57 - so that's right
44:59 - so good so then what i'm gonna do once
45:00 - we loop through this which is all good
45:02 - all good and handy we need to replace
45:05 - this html
45:06 - with what we need to replace whatever is
45:10 - inside this main section product with
45:11 - the html that we generate
45:13 - so for example i'm going to go to main
45:14 - section product
45:17 - right let me say the following outside
45:20 - this for each loop
45:22 - okay i will say document
45:26 - dot query selector
45:29 - selector okay i'm going to select the
45:31 - element
45:32 - dot main section product the
45:36 - inner html is equal to what guys what do
45:38 - you guys think put in the
45:39 - put in the chat what do you guys think
45:44 - what do you guys think here at line 25
45:48 - guys
45:49 - items html that's right so now what i do
45:52 - items html
45:56 - save that my friend and then that's
46:00 - it look we got ourselves the array
46:03 - that's looking good and let's see if we
46:06 - actually get the general item let's go
46:08 - ahead and remove this console log we
46:09 - don't need this anymore
46:11 - this generate items right here is
46:14 - being called through here this items
46:17 - gets the data
46:18 - and then we actually create the items
46:19 - using html and so now if i simply just
46:22 - go
46:24 - oh look at that this is the data that's
46:27 - coming directly from a database guys
46:30 - directly from a database
46:34 - because that means if i simply just
46:36 - remove if i go back to
46:37 - minus html if i remove the whole main
46:39 - product thing
46:41 - this whole main product right remove it
46:44 - so there's nothing inside me such a
46:45 - product
46:46 - save it look it's
46:49 - there because why it's in the database
46:53 - so for example right that's right if for
46:55 - example i want to add a new document
46:56 - let's just say i want a new
46:57 - document i'm going to say image image
46:59 - let's just add a new document here guys
47:00 - ready
47:01 - let's do it right now let's join title
47:03 - switch copy image address
47:07 - paste the value here add field name
47:11 - also nintendo
47:15 - yo switch okay yeah field
47:18 - make make nintendo
47:24 - rating uh 290
47:28 - waiting is gonna be two four point seven
47:33 - two ninety minutes uh it's a high
47:36 - ratings make it also into a number
47:39 - let's give it a 290 number
47:42 - save right so now we have two products
47:45 - and now if i go to my amazon
47:47 - and i refresh it oh
47:53 - you see it's right there but you can see
47:56 - now this tells us that oh
47:57 - doesn't work you know it doesn't work
48:00 - very well
48:01 - you know because now we have two
48:04 - products
48:05 - so we can fix that really easily if we
48:07 - go back to where if we go to main
48:09 - section product
48:11 - we just simply change this right here
48:13 - main such a product to be flex
48:16 - save that and that's it of course right
48:19 - and then let's go ahead and maybe add a
48:21 - margin right to the actual thing so if i
48:23 - go to back to my
48:25 - script.js let's do a margin right on the
48:28 - actual main product so
48:30 - mr-5 save that oh
48:34 - you see now it's spaced out very evenly
48:36 - you have this item
48:37 - this item and this is coming directly
48:40 - guys from a database
48:41 - nowhere else how cool is that
48:44 - that's pretty sweet that's pretty
48:46 - awesome all right
48:48 - we've got ourselves the main product
48:52 - all right beautiful okay all right
48:53 - beautiful the next thing to do is let's
48:56 - go ahead and actually make this add to
48:57 - cart button work
49:00 - let's add the card button all right so
49:02 - that we actually add card items
49:04 - all right jesse you want to get started
49:06 - on the add to cart button
49:08 - yeah for sure oh you okay oh
49:11 - yeah jesse her camera just went down
49:13 - just oh my god
49:14 - i'm here still is she alive yeah it just
49:16 - is alive
49:18 - jesse didn't die no no please not
49:23 - awesome so where are we at now we
49:26 - have generated the items guys
49:30 - isn't that cool so i would say
49:34 - hmm what's up next well like i said
49:38 - we want to make sure that we have that
49:39 - to cart we're gonna make sure that the
49:41 - card is working yeah if we add something
49:45 - add to cart
49:46 - we want notification at the at the top
49:50 - that orange cart we want that to you
49:52 - know give the number
49:54 - of items that's right that's right
49:57 - plus we also want to if we go to our
50:00 - cart
50:01 - we want to see the products that we
50:02 - added to the cart
50:04 - that's right right here which we don't
50:06 - see right now
50:08 - no because this is static
50:11 - okay well we coded up yesterday that's
50:13 - right exactly hey
50:18 - jesse yeah i was gonna say okay now i
50:22 - guess i'll just continue
50:23 - okay so then what's gonna happen is we
50:26 - have
50:26 - the add to cart guys okay um now
50:30 - the hard thing understood we understand
50:32 - is
50:33 - we need to do something with javascript
50:35 - in with this button
50:38 - and react.js this stuff is pretty easy
50:40 - to make that work because you're just
50:41 - buying the actual thing
50:43 - but unfortunately with javascript is not
50:45 - as easy okay
50:46 - with vanilla javascript but this will
50:48 - show you how this needs to be done
50:51 - when you go underneath the hood
50:53 - underneath the hood
50:54 - this is actually how react gs works
50:57 - so in order to make this fully work it's
51:00 - going to be a little bit more tricky
51:02 - than we thought all right
51:04 - and how is that the case well let's take
51:06 - a look at it
51:08 - we need to make this button function
51:10 - when we click add to cart we need to
51:12 - know
51:13 - what card to add or what item to add but
51:16 - it gets a little bit tricky because how
51:17 - do we get this data
51:18 - once inside the html the data is inside
51:21 - the items right the actual items which
51:23 - is
51:23 - an array so to fix that
51:28 - we're going to create an actual element
51:31 - check it out
51:31 - okay and just pay attention here just
51:33 - pay very close attention don't worry
51:35 - so much not
51:48 - own documents or available own elements
51:51 - html element
51:53 - create element okay and this is an
51:56 - element going to be a div element
51:59 - all right document not this is horrible
52:03 - right there okay document underneath
52:07 - that we're going to say hey you know
52:08 - what doc
52:09 - that class list we're going to add all
52:11 - the classes of the actual main product
52:13 - dot class list dot add
52:19 - i'm going to add all the classes again
52:20 - this is using javascriptionality i'm
52:22 - going to say hey
52:23 - you see just how we have main product
52:25 - we're going to add the main product
52:26 - inside here
52:27 - so main dash product
52:31 - comma then we have mr
52:35 - margin right five
52:38 - right and then we have what um honestly
52:41 - on that that's pretty much it
52:43 - i want to say yeah that's it i'm
52:45 - identified that's all the ones we got so
52:46 - far
52:48 - so to create this document right it's
52:50 - nothing so far
52:52 - because all everything else is still
52:53 - working
52:55 - but here's the cool part inside here i
52:58 - want to say
52:58 - doc dot inner html
53:02 - is equal to the following also backticks
53:06 - we're going to take everything that's
53:08 - inside here
53:09 - this div product image right command
53:14 - exit cut it put it inside the dock
53:19 - yeah so we're going a little bit deeper
53:21 - guys
53:22 - it's going to be a little bit harder now
53:25 - but that's okay all right
53:28 - let me make sure that we have that okay
53:30 - there we go so now inside here we have
53:33 - that we create this div
53:34 - we have inside that we have the product
53:36 - image you know the product name
53:38 - all that stuff that's looking pretty
53:39 - good
53:41 - but what we're going to change now
53:42 - that's going to make this whole thing
53:44 - worth it is actually going to be
53:46 - the add to cart because you see how we
53:47 - have at the card is just an html element
53:49 - which we can't really do anything right
53:51 - now because to a string we can't
53:53 - do an event listener to a string
53:57 - all right so i'm going to default i'm
54:00 - going to say
54:01 - let add to cart element and i'm going to
54:05 - create a new element i'm going to say
54:06 - document
54:08 - dot create create element
54:12 - boom i'm gonna say this is a div
54:16 - okay all right and then i'm going to add
54:20 - all of these little uh kind of class
54:23 - list
54:23 - to it separately so i actually have this
54:26 - html right here
54:27 - or this javascript here so add to cart
54:30 - element
54:31 - that classes.ad the same thing is did it
54:34 - here
54:35 - we're do we're doing the same thing here
54:38 - i can copy and paste this
54:40 - oh what happened here there we go i'm
54:43 - going to copy and paste this for you
54:45 - guys so you guys can have it inside the
54:46 - zoom chat
54:49 - boom right there and that's it
54:53 - okay now we're not done yet because we
54:56 - have this add to cart element that's all
54:57 - good no problem
54:58 - right then check this out what we're
55:01 - gonna do is we're gonna say hey you know
55:02 - what the inner text this one add
55:04 - to cart element the inner text
55:08 - is equal to add
55:11 - to cart basically we're replacing this
55:14 - whole
55:15 - div as a string to an actual html
55:18 - element all right
55:22 - and this is where it gets really
55:23 - interesting because now look at this i
55:26 - can say the following
55:27 - doc which is the whole main product
55:30 - which is this one
55:32 - doc dot append child
55:36 - add to card element right
55:40 - oh good nothing crazy right nothing
55:41 - crazy
55:43 - but it gets even better because now look
55:45 - at this i say document
55:48 - remember this right here query selector
55:49 - i'm going to say document
55:53 - the query selector main section products
55:56 - that
55:56 - append child
56:00 - and then append child the actual doc
56:03 - which is this whole doc that we just
56:04 - said right here boom
56:06 - a pen child save that we can remove this
56:09 - inner html stuff
56:11 - save that and look it's there right we
56:15 - have add to cart
56:16 - you know right and so forth why do we
56:18 - have multiple out the cars because we
56:19 - have this add to cart it says html
56:21 - and we also have it here so let's go
56:22 - ahead and remove that
56:25 - save it and right there it's looking
56:27 - pretty good the same as before
56:29 - and so i know what you're asking
56:30 - probably at this point like nas didn't
56:31 - we have this before
56:32 - why are you telling us all this
56:34 - complicated stuff with the
56:36 - you know create element and and that's
56:37 - it well
56:39 - there's a few reasons because now i can
56:42 - go back okay
56:45 - because i have access to the actual
56:46 - element i can create event listeners
56:49 - you see it looked the same as before but
56:51 - before just a string
56:53 - this time it's an actual object and i
56:55 - can work with objects but i can't work
56:56 - with strings
56:58 - and so if i that's right if i go ahead
57:01 - and do this and i
57:02 - say hey add to cart
57:05 - add to cart element dot
57:09 - add event listener this allows us to add
57:12 - an event click listener
57:14 - i'm going to say on the click of this
57:16 - button
57:18 - comma okay
57:21 - i'm going to create a function like this
57:25 - boom and inside the function i'm going
57:27 - to call
57:28 - a function called add to cart and i'm
57:31 - going to pass in the actual item
57:35 - so the whole item data which is this
57:37 - item data
57:39 - is going to go directly into the add to
57:41 - confessionality and we're going to
57:42 - create the function at the card right
57:44 - now
57:45 - function add to cart
57:50 - boom of course it takes in one item
57:54 - save that that's it and now i'm going to
57:57 - console log
57:58 - right here console.log
58:02 - right add to
58:06 - cart clicked
58:09 - and then i'm going to show what data are
58:11 - we actually passing in
58:12 - console.log item
58:17 - boom now here's the cool thing add to
58:22 - cart is there
58:23 - beautiful add to cart is here
58:27 - let's see what's going to happen inspect
58:29 - element
58:33 - console log click add to cart
58:39 - oh look at that add to cart is clicked
58:43 - and here's the data that we clicked we
58:45 - clicked on the nintendo switch
58:47 - because i can now get the data i can
58:50 - pass it into our database okay otherwise
58:52 - i wouldn't be able to guys
58:54 - i cannot just pass in a string of html
58:57 - into database and then let the database
58:59 - figure out hey i'm gonna use this data
59:01 - this data and this data
59:02 - it does not happen i
59:06 - have to use actual data like
59:09 - strings you know right here like numbers
59:13 - that's why i had to create the whole
59:15 - create element thing
59:16 - otherwise i wouldn't be able to do it
59:20 - okay does everyone does that make sense
59:22 - guys i know this is a little hard to
59:24 - grasp but
59:25 - it's it's something we need you guys
59:27 - need to understand kind of sometimes
59:30 - okay because we now have this okay we
59:32 - have we're getting this data inside here
59:35 - we can do something with it okay and
59:37 - what can we do
59:39 - well let's figure out how do we actually
59:40 - add data to a firebase database
59:43 - so let's think about it so if i go
59:46 - to add data right here but we see it
59:49 - says add data
59:50 - that's exactly how we're going to do it
59:51 - but we're going to do a little bit a
59:53 - little bit differently
59:54 - because i'm going to say the following
59:58 - i'm going to say okay so db the
60:01 - collection
60:04 - the collection okay i'm gonna say
60:07 - you know i'm going to give the
60:09 - collection called the cart item
60:11 - card items okay
60:14 - that document so i'm going to create a
60:18 - new document that we're using
60:20 - with the id of item dot id
60:24 - okay so i'm going to create that right
60:26 - now so let
60:28 - card item
60:31 - db the collection id so i'm gonna do
60:33 - that right now
60:34 - actually let's do that kind of like this
60:36 - i got id
60:37 - and then i'm going to do um
60:39 - [Music]
60:41 - dot document dot i wanna say
60:44 - set data id i'm gonna do
60:47 - dot set right same thing
60:51 - to set the data and now here's the data
60:54 - okay the data is going to be what well
60:57 - first thing is going to be
60:58 - image right item.image
61:04 - that image comma then we have
61:07 - make item.make
61:14 - right then we have name
61:19 - item.name
61:22 - thank you jesse rating item that rating
61:27 - that's right then we have right uh
61:30 - quantity and already price but we also
61:33 - have to include the quantity remember
61:35 - how much quantity are we actually giving
61:36 - it right well let's think about this
61:38 - right
61:39 - let's do a quantity oh jesse
61:42 - a zoo quantity of just initially one we
61:45 - click add to card we're just any
61:46 - quantity of one
61:48 - item that quantity yeah right there
61:51 - that's it right set the price we have
61:53 - the rating we have the name
61:54 - make although that the question card
61:56 - items that dock item id
61:58 - and so forth all right but this is where
62:01 - it gets a little bit trickier
62:03 - because what i want to do is the
62:05 - following okay
62:08 - i'm going to go back to my uh
62:11 - amazon application inspect element
62:14 - and then let's test out what's going to
62:16 - happen console
62:18 - add to cart nothing
62:22 - all right well hold on let's go to our
62:25 - amazon database
62:27 - oh we have to make the collection of
62:29 - card items
62:30 - um not necessarily actually not
62:33 - necessarily
62:35 - necessarily because let's think about
62:38 - this
62:39 - card item dvd collection card items let
62:42 - me remove this portion right here
62:46 - that's set um
62:51 - id let me try one more time was it not
62:55 - add let me try it
62:58 - nothing let me try it one more time
63:00 - let's go inspect down but on this one
63:06 - console
63:07 - [Music]
63:12 - i think it's because we need to use dot
63:14 - ad so let's do that add
63:16 - oh let's do that add like this but i
63:18 - want to use a specific id so i
63:20 - kind of want to do that document item
63:22 - that id let me see
63:28 - so log oh are we give
63:33 - the item id or we giving the item
63:36 - we're giving the whole item oh yeah no
63:38 - the whole item so let me see so
63:40 - we're gonna do uh yeah console.log item
63:44 - when we click on it let's see
63:47 - okay amazon inspect element on this one
63:56 - console add to cart
63:59 - okay so it's adding to cart it's
64:01 - actually functioning
64:02 - but it's not doing the way i kind of
64:04 - want it to work mainly
64:06 - [Music]
64:10 - i i do think that that we need to add a
64:12 - collection called card items otherwise
64:14 - he doesn't know
64:15 - to which collection to add a document
64:17 - correct
64:18 - yeah i think we're going to do okay so
64:20 - in that case
64:26 - otherwise we first have to make a new
64:27 - collection
64:30 - joe you're doing that's good joe i like
64:32 - it that's good that's good so you're
64:33 - right
64:34 - so let's see so at first i want to just
64:37 - show you guys what if we did it just
64:38 - simply this way just that ad okay
64:40 - so i just said simply did that add
64:45 - that ad just how they have it here
64:48 - okay command c
64:51 - you know oh let me do this let me see
64:55 - hold on
64:56 - add to firestore
65:00 - with a with a custom id
65:07 - let me see so the duck and that's set so
65:10 - right there did we like collect the car
65:11 - items
65:12 - that dock
65:16 - let me see that should that should still
65:18 - tell you where that dog
65:21 - but then you're giving yeah you have
65:24 - yeah
65:24 - dog item id the dog
65:28 - item does id
65:32 - and the make and then you can use set if
65:35 - you like probably
65:36 - let me see the set
65:39 - that should work actually i'm not sure
65:41 - what that looking let's see command c
65:44 - let's see inspect element
65:51 - oh
65:56 - console yeah database
65:59 - nothing
66:03 - am i looking the right yellow base by
66:04 - the way oh
66:06 - it just didn't refresh oh it was working
66:10 - the whole time guys look at this
66:12 - i know i'll come on fire but i do think
66:16 - it's because you added the
66:17 - doc item id and no it was there it was
66:20 - there it was there the whole time
66:21 - actually
66:21 - oh so yeah so look we are creating a new
66:24 - document
66:25 - specific id which is this id28m and then
66:28 - we're sending the data for this right
66:30 - and so here it is it's showing up
66:31 - right here guys okay right here which is
66:34 - perfect exactly we want
66:35 - but of course here's the issue when i
66:38 - click add to cart here guys
66:41 - the issue is it's just going to add one
66:44 - quantity it's gonna
66:45 - it's gonna replace that one thing again
66:48 - and again and again
66:49 - look see look we also have another and
66:52 - again it's always gonna be quantity one
66:55 - but
66:56 - shouldn't we if we for example
67:00 - if i click add to cart shouldn't it add
67:02 - the quantity one plus one plus one plus
67:04 - one
67:05 - can i get a thumbs up if you guys agree
67:06 - with me on that one yeah
67:08 - right so it should be plus one
67:12 - on the quantity that's already there but
67:15 - here's the question
67:16 - what if the iron item does not exist
67:18 - inside the card item
67:20 - what if it does not exist this is weird
67:23 - well
67:23 - you have to check first if it's new
67:25 - that's right so you have to be a little
67:27 - bit smaller now at this point
67:28 - that's right right so what we're gonna
67:31 - do is a little bit different now
67:33 - we're going to grab that dock right here
67:37 - okay listen up we're gonna do card items
67:41 - i'm going to say let card item
67:45 - ezekiel do the clutch the card so
67:46 - basically we're going to grab a specific
67:49 - card item based on the item id
67:51 - okay we're going to say card item
67:54 - dot get right they're just gonna get it
67:58 - and then that then on the card item
68:02 - and then we'll do a function right
68:05 - like this now there's a lot of
68:07 - complicated stuff but don't worry we'll
68:09 - do doc
68:11 - okay and then inside the dock a few
68:14 - things we can do we can say check the
68:15 - following we say
68:16 - if doc exists
68:20 - dot exists basically if it's if that
68:23 - already exists
68:24 - right meaning we have already added our
68:27 - first quantity to the cart
68:29 - then what should we do what are we going
68:32 - to do
68:34 - plus one on top of that if you don't
68:36 - want we will do a card item
68:38 - dot update right
68:41 - the update that update i'm going to say
68:45 - update the quantity we'll do quantity
68:48 - right quantity and we're going to get
68:52 - the current doc
68:53 - theta right there
68:56 - the quantity plus one
69:01 - plus one right there you see so we're
69:04 - gonna up
69:05 - if the basically if card exists it's
69:07 - like this right
69:08 - it's like this kind of like this
69:12 - if item exists
69:16 - exist right add quantity
69:22 - to t to current one
69:26 - otherwise
69:32 - otherwise
69:34 - create a new card item
69:38 - okay that's the functionality that's the
69:40 - pseudo code and that's it guys
69:43 - so we have the if doc exists else
69:46 - meaning it does not exist yet it's a new
69:48 - one that we're going to add
69:50 - i'm going to say caroline.set like this
69:53 - boom boom card iron.set
69:58 - the image the make the name the price
70:00 - the rating
70:01 - and of course it's going to start up
70:02 - with quantity one but once it's there
70:05 - it's always going to increase the
70:06 - quantity plus one plus one
70:08 - plus one you guys got it so let me go
70:11 - and save that and let me show you guys
70:12 - how that works
70:14 - so at the cart let me see
70:18 - let's look at this now the quantity is
70:19 - one two
70:21 - you see right there let me show you i'm
70:22 - gonna show this to live to you guys
70:24 - i want you guys to watch this portion
70:26 - right here watch this
70:28 - quantity as i increase it on my end
70:33 - three four five six seven
70:36 - eight nine a ten that's a lot of
70:39 - nintendo switches
70:42 - how cool is that you guys did it it is
70:45 - now in a database
70:46 - and that's it right and if i add a new
70:49 - idea for example this is a macbook pro
70:51 - right
70:52 - look at the cart you see it just
70:54 - appeared right here
70:55 - and now this one started out with a
70:57 - quantity of one
71:01 - that's it right so again add the card
71:04 - one
71:04 - two three four five six assembly and
71:08 - nine and then
71:08 - you see the quantity is now increasing
71:13 - that's it my friends so we've done that
71:17 - and that's pretty pretty pretty much it
71:19 - which is really cool let me go and
71:20 - remove this set because we need a set
71:22 - right here
71:23 - right here right save that and our
71:26 - active card functionality is now working
71:28 - and it's working pretty darn good
71:33 - so now what we can do now we have the
71:35 - add to cart we have the generate items
71:37 - regain the data from there just see
71:41 - what's next jesse tell me hmm what's
71:44 - next what next what's next where
71:48 - you want to write that notification
71:50 - function or
71:51 - shall we go to the cards html let's make
71:54 - this notification
71:55 - i can work awesome so
71:59 - that means so what does that
72:01 - notification actually say guys put it in
72:04 - the chat
72:04 - what does it say what does it represent
72:07 - i want you guys to start thinking about
72:09 - that
72:12 - what does it represent
72:16 - it represents the amount of items that
72:19 - we have in our cart
72:20 - so the amount that we added the total
72:23 - amount
72:24 - correct so if that's right monique
72:30 - exactly monique number of products in
72:33 - cart
72:34 - very well so let's go to
72:37 - our index.html okay and let's
72:40 - look up that um that card
72:44 - and as you can see on i believe
72:48 - on line 45 nas has made that beautiful
72:52 - comment there
72:53 - of card icon okay and indeed
72:56 - on line 48 that's exactly
72:59 - where we're going we're going to be
73:01 - working with that because here look
73:03 - we have a hard-coded one there
73:07 - but it should not be hard-coded right
73:08 - it's dynamic because it represents
73:11 - the whole um everything that's inside of
73:14 - the items
73:16 - so nas what's the functionality we
73:18 - should write for that
73:19 - so let's create the functionality to
73:21 - actually get the card items
73:23 - right get the card items that's right
73:25 - and get the card items
73:27 - and then let's try the functionality to
73:29 - where
73:30 - we can actually you know generate that
73:32 - amount of quantity
73:34 - now because we're going to be smart
73:35 - about this you see we have card.html
73:38 - that both have the same data cut the
73:40 - html index.html right
73:42 - they both have the header we're going to
73:44 - create our own javascript
73:46 - file called called head.gs so let's do
73:48 - that header
73:50 - dot js all right
73:54 - and this header.js is going to be shared
73:56 - by
73:57 - the card.html and index.html
74:00 - all right that's right so let's go ahead
74:03 - and do that let's go ahead and go to
74:04 - index.html
74:05 - and let's include head.gs so inside here
74:09 - we'll do script source
74:13 - is equal to header dot gs
74:17 - boom done all right so let's include
74:19 - instead of html and it's included
74:21 - inside this card.html as well
74:24 - in both pages guys that's right so let's
74:28 - do it like this
74:29 - script source
74:33 - right cart um
74:37 - header dot gs boom in both pages
74:40 - all right yes that means now let's go to
74:43 - header.js and the first function we need
74:45 - to create is going to be
74:47 - a get card items
74:50 - so that's right thank you jesse so get
74:52 - the card items and this going to get the
74:54 - card items from an actual database
74:57 - right and what is that database guys
75:01 - guess what the collection that we
75:03 - already have
75:04 - that's right cards items by the way guys
75:08 - make sure that this
75:09 - cart items is exactly written the same
75:11 - way as
75:12 - the collection is called in firebase
75:14 - okay otherwise you're not able to
75:15 - retrieve
75:16 - the data okay so
75:20 - that said let's continue again
75:24 - i want to know what's inside of the fire
75:26 - store i want to know all of the items
75:28 - that are
75:29 - inside of it so i'm going to say on
75:31 - snapshot
75:32 - that's right but look at check this out
75:34 - on snapchat is a little bit different
75:36 - than what we had before if you go to
75:37 - script ngs
75:38 - you see before to get data we used the
75:41 - get.then
75:42 - let's try that right now and then we'll
75:44 - talk about what on snapchat works
75:46 - so let's see yeah that's a good one
75:48 - that's a good one
75:49 - so first get okay which is a function
75:52 - first function and then
75:54 - then so we're going to wait whoops not
75:56 - touch event
75:57 - then okay
76:01 - and then we're going to wait what was it
76:04 - quick query snapshot that's right so
76:06 - let's do query snapshot
76:08 - query snapshot right here okay
76:11 - that's right and just how we have it
76:13 - inside here this for each loop okay
76:16 - inside the for each loop let's go and
76:17 - open this up uh one second jesse
76:20 - one second so be careful with that
76:22 - because i need to create
76:23 - you to put into a function oh sorry
76:25 - sorry right so
76:26 - inside the query snapshot we're going to
76:28 - loop through that just how do we we did
76:29 - it before it's no question i'm sure that
76:31 - what for each right here
76:35 - oops not like that four each right for
76:38 - every single element
76:40 - we're gonna grab the dock right
76:44 - right there and of course we'll get the
76:47 - card items but
76:48 - now let's be smart about this because
76:51 - look
76:52 - we have the quantity you guys tell me
76:54 - how do we figure out
76:56 - what is the total of card items inside
76:59 - the card
77:00 - because it's definitely not two
77:04 - what is the equation we need to use to
77:07 - figure out what is the total amount of
77:09 - card items inside the card it is not two
77:12 - what is it guys well the first
77:16 - we have 14 nintendo switches
77:21 - okay i think how many macbooks do we
77:24 - have
77:24 - which is going to be 10.
77:28 - so that's 24. that's right but what i do
77:31 - know
77:31 - is that with the query snapshot we made
77:34 - a snapshot of all the items so we're
77:36 - looping through each document
77:38 - so nintendo switch and mac
77:41 - and from each document what do i want to
77:43 - get guys
77:45 - yes the quantity that's right so
77:48 - i think we should make like a variable
77:50 - called count
77:52 - total count and of course we're always
77:54 - gonna start off with zero
77:56 - so total count indeed and then we're
77:59 - going to say
77:59 - total count
78:02 - plus equal to the quantity of
78:07 - each document so doc data parentheses
78:10 - dot quantity
78:14 - [Music]
78:15 - so that way when we're looping through
78:18 - all the documents we're adding up the
78:20 - quantity of
78:21 - each document each card item makes total
78:25 - sense right
78:26 - that's right then of course now that we
78:28 - have that number
78:30 - next thing is of course that we have to
78:32 - do something with that number but let's
78:33 - first log
78:34 - our total currency of our calculation is
78:36 - correct
78:37 - let's go and call our function called
78:39 - get card items
78:42 - save that inspect alma on this one
78:47 - so guys the answer should be here 24
78:53 - [Music]
78:57 - let's go michael there we go that's what
78:59 - i'm talking about are you are you in the
79:00 - library again
79:03 - nice beautiful so we got that right it's
79:07 - 24 because why we just added the
79:09 - quantities together but of course now we
79:11 - need to we need to do something with the
79:12 - quantity right
79:14 - we need to actually change this data
79:17 - right here
79:19 - that's it yeah so just like we were
79:21 - generating card items or you were
79:23 - generating items
79:25 - we also
79:28 - you know need to set the counter so
79:31 - indeed set card counter
79:33 - and then give it total count
79:37 - that means also we gotta write a
79:39 - function called
79:40 - set card counter of course
79:44 - with the total count
79:48 - okay and now let's look in our
79:51 - what was the class again where we had
79:54 - that little one
79:55 - where we had that heart coded let me
79:57 - show you a card icon it is called
79:59 - cart item number aha here guys on
80:02 - line 49 cart item number
80:07 - so we're gonna get this class and look
80:10 - now we got the hard-coded one inside of
80:12 - there but if we go back to our header.js
80:16 - let's add that in and say exactly
80:20 - document.queryselector
80:26 - and we're going to select the card item
80:28 - number class
80:29 - and then we're going to change the inner
80:31 - text tada
80:34 - with total count
80:39 - that's it guys hey let's go
80:45 - hey that's a big win for us look 24
80:48 - just the way it should be 24 right
80:53 - now in the um index.html you can remove
80:57 - that one
80:59 - okay you can remove that one so if you
81:00 - go to any html
81:03 - remove that one we don't need that
81:04 - anymore sign up baby
81:06 - let's go let's go let's go back to
81:09 - head.gs
81:11 - okay and let's see this so so let's take
81:13 - a look at this okay
81:15 - so if i an add to cart let's do add to
81:17 - cart
81:18 - see i click add to cart but
81:19 - unfortunately it's not showing
81:21 - a new number i need to refresh in order
81:24 - for it to show 27
81:25 - because i clicked it three times oh yeah
81:29 - so it's now real time right now but this
81:32 - is where it's a trick for us
81:33 - we need to make a real time that's right
81:36 - we need to make a real time
81:39 - so the real time here nas is that
81:42 - you know when we're adding something to
81:44 - the cart when you're pressing that
81:45 - button
81:46 - we said right we're gonna add something
81:48 - to firestore that's right
81:50 - and then the cart is actually getting
81:52 - the items from a firestore however
81:55 - it only does that when you refresh the
81:57 - page again
81:59 - but firebase can help us a little bit
82:00 - with that
82:02 - right that's right so let me see db
82:05 - okay let me see you guys you can type
82:08 - jesse go heck i'm going
82:09 - okay so db collection
82:13 - and now i'm gonna use the on snapshot
82:15 - function of
82:16 - firestore so instead of first getting it
82:20 - and then waiting for it till i got it
82:22 - i'm gonna remove this okay i'm gonna
82:25 - remove this line
82:26 - and i'm gonna say on snapshot
82:30 - and not query snapshot but just snapshot
82:34 - okay and
82:38 - that's it well no that's not totally it
82:40 - here snapshot
82:42 - for each now what is it that snapshot
82:45 - does
82:45 - on snapshot has something called an
82:49 - event listener so when something changes
82:52 - inside of the firestore firebase knows
82:55 - that
82:56 - and then it will just pass the data
82:57 - through and say like hey something
82:59 - changed in my database maybe
83:01 - um you need to keep track of that
83:04 - so to give you a technical term guys
83:05 - this is called the websocket
83:09 - all right this is called a web socket
83:14 - when you on snapchat it's going to
83:16 - create a websocket so really what's
83:17 - happening here is add to cart
83:19 - and you click on that that adds
83:21 - something to a database
83:23 - because we have a consistent web socket
83:26 - it's called it's like you have a kinesis
83:28 - for example it's like me have always
83:31 - having you know you guys ever
83:33 - used uh for example anybody use those
83:36 - cups you know what they're called those
83:37 - uh listening cups you know those like uh
83:39 - what are they called
83:40 - yeah one cup you put a strawberry you
83:41 - have a rope in between and then you can
83:43 - listen to somebody
83:44 - yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right that's
83:45 - right that's right that's right so right
83:48 - every time we do we do that right
83:50 - between the cup
83:51 - it's like you're always listening to the
83:52 - database that is what's called a
83:54 - websocket
83:55 - you're listening to any changes inside
83:57 - the database so what's happening here
84:00 - when you click add to cart because we're
84:01 - using on snapshot
84:03 - this gets triggered every single time
84:06 - something inside the database to the car
84:08 - items trick gets triggered
84:10 - and then that sends the update back to
84:13 - us to the amazon clone
84:15 - that's why you can do on snapshot here
84:18 - and then you can do snapshot.docs
84:22 - for each and this will always be updated
84:26 - every time you change something in a
84:28 - database all right
84:30 - so let me show you how exactly that
84:32 - works
84:34 - let me save that oop save that
84:37 - if i go ahead and click add to cart i
84:39 - want you to pay attention right here
84:40 - everybody ready pay attention
84:42 - are you guys ready for this you guys
84:43 - ready zoom in zoom in though
84:46 - uh well if i zoom in then it won't you
84:47 - won't see the me click at the cart
84:49 - so okay pay attention to here
84:52 - three two one
84:56 - are you ready let's see
85:00 - oh look at that boom boom boom
85:03 - boom boom it's working automatically
85:06 - this is a real-time database now
85:09 - you have a real-time connection to
85:12 - the database now so nas can you show
85:15 - that again with the coding screen
85:17 - oh there's no coding screen it's there
85:19 - no
85:21 - this one it's right here right jesse on
85:25 - youtube
85:26 - it's just our facebook i keep always
85:27 - forgetting about the youtube thing all
85:29 - right
85:30 - oh man sorry youtube so guys right so
85:33 - like i said we have the card items right
85:34 - here
85:35 - right we have the snapshot because we're
85:37 - using snapshot it's got it's like always
85:39 - having the connection right
85:41 - and if i do it again at the card one two
85:44 - three
85:44 - four watch this one
85:47 - two three four five it's always there
85:51 - and it's always going to be updated who
85:53 - found the really cool guys
85:54 - i always find this really cool anytime
85:56 - this is a real-time situation i'm always
85:57 - like
85:58 - [Applause]
85:59 - [Music]
86:00 - you can do that you can do that in
86:02 - coding of course you can't coding is
86:04 - cool
86:05 - so there you go rehearsing is the best
86:08 - we have our functionality
86:09 - to add to cart okay so before we get
86:12 - into the actual card that you asked the
86:14 - card you know the actual card um
86:16 - app i want to do something really small
86:19 - right now
86:20 - and i wanna you see how kind of right
86:22 - now when i make something smaller
86:24 - it's kind of like um it feels weird
86:27 - you see how this goes outside the box
86:29 - right there you see
86:31 - i don't like that way too much right so
86:34 - let's make that change right now because
86:35 - i want to make it clean
86:37 - all right so to make that clean i
86:39 - actually want to make sure that this
86:41 - whole thing grabs
86:42 - down to the bottom okay
86:45 - we'll make sure it wraps down to the
86:46 - bottom so let's go back to our inner
86:48 - html all right
86:51 - let's go to our categories
86:56 - right there cyber uh not those
86:57 - categories
86:59 - popular categories which are uh
87:02 - da here
87:06 - these categories right here right and
87:09 - what do we know well in order to make
87:11 - sure that it actually fully wraps around
87:13 - we're going to say flex dash rap
87:16 - boom see when we
87:20 - because we decreased it wrapped the
87:21 - second line otherwise it's just going to
87:24 - keep going one line all the time like
87:26 - strap but because of that problem
87:28 - because there's a padding on the left
87:29 - hand side of every single element see
87:31 - when i when i look at this here
87:33 - there's a margin left and every single
87:35 - element let me show you here see margin
87:36 - left six right here
87:38 - that's a problem and so that's why it's
87:40 - pushing it like this
87:43 - and to remove that we're going to
87:45 - actually do a margin
87:46 - right six out of our module left check
87:48 - this out i'm gonna say like this
87:52 - so i'm gonna say like this so uh i'm
87:54 - gonna select this one
87:56 - i'm gonna do command d or ctrl d to
87:58 - select multiple things
88:00 - boom boom my trick that's right i know
88:03 - jesse's trick exactly we'll call the
88:04 - jessie's magic
88:08 - mr-6
88:11 - boom then that work out oh mr
88:16 - my bad save that right there you see now
88:19 - it's a lot better right we have space on
88:21 - the left hand side and we have here
88:23 - let's copy this to mar sj6 and let's
88:25 - make sure to put it all the way on the
88:27 - first item as well
88:28 - because the first item has nothing so
88:30 - let me go back up
88:31 - this first item does not have any mr6
88:36 - right boom a little bit cleaner now much
88:38 - better but we're not done yet guys
88:40 - not there yet what i want to do now is i
88:43 - want to
88:44 - uh add a padding top you see how there's
88:46 - no spacing between right here do we see
88:48 - that everybody
88:49 - well let's add that let's be smart about
88:51 - that okay
88:53 - let's be smart about that to do that
88:56 - we're gonna
88:56 - actually add a margin top i'm gonna
88:59 - select mr6 again
89:01 - command d command d command d command d
89:04 - command d that way i can type all the
89:07 - same time much faster
89:08 - so multiple cursors multiple cursors
89:11 - that's right
89:12 - right and then what i'm gonna do is i'm
89:15 - gonna go to the left hand side
89:17 - click space and do a margin top dash
89:20 - five all right and that added everywhere
89:23 - you see it added margin top
89:24 - right here right here right here
89:28 - to every single element so i'm going to
89:30 - save that now
89:31 - and look at that there is no margin
89:33 - inside here but this created now too
89:35 - much spacing around here which i don't
89:36 - like
89:37 - which we can remove right now all i have
89:39 - to do is go to the
89:40 - uh popular categories and just simply
89:43 - remove
89:44 - the margin top 10 i think that's on the
89:47 - main section probably no no not here
89:50 - no this one module 5 that's under
89:53 - categories
89:54 - save that boom and look at that
89:58 - our popular categories are now much much
90:00 - cleaner
90:01 - than before would you guys agree with me
90:04 - i mean i do i don't know if you don't
90:06 - but it's too bad you know if you don't
90:07 - and if you make the screen smaller nice
90:10 - it would also have to be yes let's go
90:14 - it's becoming now a lot more mobile
90:15 - friendly and that's our goal is to make
90:17 - this a lot more mobile friendly
90:19 - so now look is that cool guys that's
90:21 - really cool
90:22 - we've got our index.html that's all
90:25 - working very
90:25 - well let's get to the hard part and
90:29 - let's
90:30 - work on the card jesse okay are you
90:32 - ready
90:35 - i know what is the hard part well
90:39 - we already did a lot of hard things so
90:41 - we added a functionality to the add to
90:44 - cart
90:44 - button uh once we had that
90:48 - we um had the notification functionality
90:52 - okay that is showing up in our card but
90:54 - now
90:55 - if we go to the cart page we actually
90:58 - want to see the items that we
91:00 - added correct so
91:03 - in our car touch html yesterday
91:07 - we already added i believe the nintendo
91:10 - switch
91:10 - yes but guys remember this one was
91:14 - hard coded yeah fully static
91:18 - fully static so let's make it dynamic
91:21 - okay let's do that jesse and as you can
91:23 - see the part that
91:24 - that knot is highlighting guess what
91:27 - that's the part that we're going to be
91:29 - making um dynamic and that is
91:32 - one card item one card item
91:36 - and guess what guys to what class are we
91:39 - adding
91:40 - card items boom
91:44 - cart items line 111 okay
91:47 - so let's do that and let's open up and
91:50 - make a new file
91:51 - called car.js so new file
91:55 - card.js book
91:58 - okay and of course the card.js
92:01 - where do we want this file to work guys
92:04 - in our card.html
92:06 - correct so let's link that up at the top
92:09 - okay so just like we linked up the
92:13 - header.js i'm just going to copy that
92:15 - one
92:16 - and i'm going to boop paste it in
92:20 - and here i'm going to say card.js
92:24 - like this okay uh that's it right now
92:28 - i'm not forgetting anything right
92:30 - yeah that's it the only thing we need to
92:31 - now import besides the
92:33 - gs is let's import the header.js
92:36 - inside the card.html to make sure that's
92:38 - all working all right
92:40 - so we got the header how the gs is
92:41 - centered html which is all great that's
92:43 - great and dandy
92:44 - uh but it looks like for some reason
92:46 - it's not updating this number
92:47 - i'm not sure why that's the case let me
92:50 - take a look at it here
92:52 - the card icon card item number
92:56 - that should work it still says want for
92:58 - some reason
93:01 - had that gs actually i know that's not
93:03 - working because why
93:05 - we don't have don't have any firebase
93:07 - that's right
93:08 - that's right so let's go back to our
93:10 - index.html and you see all this firebase
93:12 - database let me go and make this a
93:13 - little bit smaller so you guys can see
93:14 - it better
93:15 - let's take all this firebase stuff and
93:18 - it kind of starts
93:19 - from here command c i'll paste it in for
93:22 - you guys as well
93:25 - okay paste it for you guys right there
93:28 - yeah guys
93:29 - so make sure you have the exact scripts
93:32 - with the gstatic.com okay like we got
93:36 - different documentation yesterday
93:38 - and then you're gonna add your
93:40 - firebase.js file yeah
93:42 - you may have to make sure that you add
93:43 - that beforehand.js because because
93:46 - header.js uses firebase
93:49 - to actually get the data right so we
93:50 - need to include this that this right
93:52 - here
93:53 - we also need to include firebase.js
93:55 - because firebase.js
93:56 - contains all of the configuration files
93:59 - right
94:00 - so we'll do right there just doing it
94:03 - right now firebase.js
94:06 - yeah header.gs and the card.gs is right
94:09 - here so save that
94:10 - and boom you can see right there 409 is
94:13 - right there just how it should be
94:15 - we can now go ahead and remove that
94:18 - portion where's the card icon
94:22 - card icon card dash icon
94:25 - let's remove that from
94:28 - one second here this one we don't need
94:31 - this one anymore
94:32 - save that one and that's it you see now
94:35 - it's just
94:36 - 49. and now we can focus on actually
94:38 - making sure that
94:39 - all of this stuff now works the way it
94:42 - should be and they're actually coming
94:43 - from a database and not just static
94:47 - hey let's go so let's
94:50 - write some code in our cart.js file
94:56 - so let's go call the gs and let's write
94:58 - some code right
95:00 - as if we don't have run any code in it
95:02 - before
95:05 - well we're going to write functions
95:06 - again guys so by now you know the drill
95:09 - right
95:09 - so what are we what do we want to show
95:13 - at the cart page tell me we want to show
95:16 - card items right
95:17 - so like before we wanted to show items
95:20 - the hot deals
95:21 - now you want to show cart items and we
95:24 - wanted to make dynamically you want them
95:26 - to get out of the database okay
95:28 - so whoops function
95:31 - get heart items
95:34 - i'm going to name a function like this
95:37 - okay
95:38 - and of course um
95:43 - we're gonna be using firebase so we have
95:45 - everything already imported so i can
95:47 - just say collection
95:49 - cart items and
95:53 - guess what what do you think we should
95:55 - be using should we
95:56 - be using the query snapshot or the on
95:59 - snapshot
96:02 - and why let me know in the chat guys
96:05 - what do you guys think
96:06 - honestly what do you guys think snapchat
96:09 - because what if we update something what
96:11 - if we update something right
96:13 - we put it so on snapshot is
96:17 - like i said and now snapchat is going to
96:18 - have a websocket right it's going to
96:20 - have a live connection to database that
96:22 - means any
96:24 - update that happens to a database is
96:26 - going to
96:27 - update our application right away if you
96:29 - just do
96:30 - you know if you just do uh you know get
96:33 - that then it's just gonna say hey no let
96:36 - me just get the data currently that
96:37 - currently there
96:38 - is that one time when you reload when
96:40 - you load the page
96:41 - but then if we do you know do any
96:43 - updates it's actually not going to
96:45 - reload because it does not have a live
96:46 - connection to a database
96:48 - right well on snapshot does that's right
96:51 - samir
96:52 - on snapchat has a constant connection
96:55 - and
96:55 - dynamic updating that's right samir so
96:58 - i'll do it right now
96:59 - so i'm gonna use on snapshot and again
97:02 - guys
97:03 - it's making a snapshot of what's inside
97:05 - of my
97:07 - firestore okay so you want to map
97:10 - through that okay so snapshot.docs
97:14 - for each and then we're gonna do
97:17 - something
97:17 - with each dock of course now we want to
97:20 - get each dog
97:22 - we want to get each card item so
97:25 - we would have to store that somewhere
97:26 - right in order to get that so let's make
97:28 - here let's make an array
97:30 - and let's call that cart items okay
97:34 - and when we're looping through our fire
97:37 - store
97:38 - you know based on the snapshot that was
97:40 - made made
97:41 - we're going to say oops items
97:45 - that push and inside of here we're going
97:49 - to
97:50 - push an object inside of it with these
97:53 - properties
97:54 - doc dot id and remember
97:58 - you could like
98:01 - you want to do it the short the short
98:03 - way or the long way
98:05 - let's do it a long way for now jesse the
98:07 - long way okay
98:08 - got it so remember this guys we're gonna
98:12 - add
98:12 - all of the properties of the card item
98:14 - inside of there
98:16 - so let's check what we did at
98:19 - script.js because i wanna have exactly
98:23 - the same
98:24 - here like this these so i'm gonna copy
98:28 - paste this
98:29 - go back to my card.js okay
98:32 - and boom this is what i need so just to
98:35 - give you guys a little bit of an update
98:37 - okay
98:37 - what are we doing here well hey you know
98:39 - what we'll say hey give us
98:41 - the latest snapshot kind of like hey
98:43 - take a picture of our current database
98:45 - from card items for every single item
98:48 - that we have inside here we're going to
98:51 - loop through it okay and we're going to
98:55 - add it to our array right here but
98:58 - i want to give you a little bit of a
99:00 - cool trick guys are you guys ready for
99:01 - this
99:02 - you see how we always have to do this
99:04 - whole thing every single time you see
99:06 - how we have to do is to do like
99:07 - image name make rating do you want to
99:10 - keep doing that
99:11 - like it's that's that's probably tiring
99:13 - right all the time to just keep doing
99:14 - the same thing over and over again am i
99:15 - right
99:16 - give me a raise of hand if you don't do
99:17 - that because i definitely don't right i
99:19 - don't i don't either
99:20 - so we can actually remove all of this
99:23 - and make it shorter
99:24 - and here's here's how because we can do
99:27 - dot dot dot dot
99:30 - data and that
99:34 - is it mic drop why
99:37 - this is what is this called this is
99:39 - called i call the underwrapper red
99:41 - operator the spread operator
99:43 - is going to take any data which is all
99:45 - this data that we have right here
99:48 - and it's going to put it kind of like
99:50 - unpack it it's kind of like how you have
99:51 - a package
99:53 - how you have a you know present you
99:55 - unpack the present and you take out all
99:57 - the items from the present and you you
99:59 - lay them out
100:00 - yeah the same thing happening here is
100:02 - taking out all the items from the doctor
100:04 - data
100:05 - and laying them out and putting them
100:06 - inside the card items
100:08 - that is it dot dot dot is your savior
100:13 - right there
100:17 - so now that we have this let's log the
100:20 - items that we have
100:22 - console cut lock card items
100:25 - [Music]
100:27 - okay and of course we have to call the
100:30 - function because otherwise
100:32 - nothing's gonna happen okay so let's do
100:35 - inspect element on here right here
100:38 - console right console
100:42 - right there all right it's got two items
100:44 - one and two
100:46 - that's it guys it's all done so all done
100:48 - though
100:50 - all right cool all right what's next so
100:54 - again guys once we have the data what do
100:56 - we need to do with the data
100:59 - [Music]
101:00 - we need to generate it this is always
101:04 - the hard part
101:06 - this is the hard part guys for sure this
101:08 - is the hard part that's right
101:09 - that was the hard part this is the hard
101:11 - part because now you gotta
101:13 - add it to your html and think about
101:16 - what is actually going on okay
101:20 - but that's okay we're just gonna guide
101:22 - you through this okay
101:23 - so generate card items start at the
101:26 - start
101:27 - make the function okay function generate
101:31 - card items and we got the card items as
101:34 - an
101:35 - argument here okay that's my function
101:37 - definition
101:38 - now we can do this a few ways and
101:42 - before now i showed you you can either
101:44 - concatenate the string
101:46 - in your html or
101:50 - you can do it the other way um we did
101:52 - after
101:53 - with creating the elements
101:55 - [Music]
101:56 - however this time it's a little bit more
102:00 - complicated so let's break it down into
102:03 - steps
102:05 - okay so let's start off
102:09 - with this and first say
102:12 - like we did before say let items html
102:15 - and let's make this an empty string like
102:17 - this okay
102:19 - then we're going to loop through each
102:21 - card item so we're going to take card
102:23 - items
102:24 - for each item
102:28 - okay arrow function and this is going to
102:31 - return
102:33 - boom it's going to be a it's going to be
102:36 - a concatenation too so here
102:38 - items 1880
102:41 - can i talk anymore items html
102:44 - plus equal backtick backtick
102:48 - okay and we're going to type inside of
102:50 - the backticks
102:52 - i don't see you typing jesse no you
102:55 - didn't see me typing nope
102:59 - here no hello
103:02 - okay so i'll just do in that case okay
103:06 - okay so we're going to go ahead i'm
103:08 - going to
103:09 - loop through every single item which we
103:10 - have done right now cut items down for
103:12 - each
103:13 - and then for each item which we get from
103:15 - here we will add the two html so i'm
103:18 - going to say
103:19 - items html
103:22 - html plus equal to
103:25 - oh there we go now it's there working
103:27 - okay
103:28 - all right now it's working jesse go
103:30 - ahead jesse now oh oh no i haven't there
103:32 - okay
103:33 - okay okay good good so
103:36 - card items we're gonna be looping
103:39 - through
103:40 - okay and um
103:44 - so let's go back to our card.html
103:48 - because that is where we had the card
103:50 - items right
103:51 - that's right the card so line 115
103:56 - okay that's where we have all the card
103:57 - items and guess what
103:59 - we want to have yes we want to have
104:04 - one card item boom
104:07 - so if you can copy this nas yeah i got
104:09 - it
104:10 - awesome right and we go back to card.js
104:13 - guys
104:14 - and now it's going to paste it in here
104:17 - html plus equal to back to tactic
104:22 - tactic command v boom boom done
104:25 - awesome done and done so
104:29 - and now guys like we did before right
104:32 - because we're using backtick backtick
104:34 - guess what we can use something called
104:38 - template literals okay so here for the
104:41 - image
104:42 - guess what dollar sign bracket open
104:47 - image okay and we're calling it here
104:50 - item
104:51 - okay so you can always call this also
104:53 - cart item if you want um
104:55 - you want more clarity but we call this
104:56 - item now okay
104:58 - so it's gonna be the same this one's
105:00 - gonna be item that name
105:02 - or not that name but bracket okay
105:05 - item that name okay
105:08 - here it is gonna be make
105:13 - right and
105:17 - this is in the total cost for first
105:22 - i'm gonna
105:25 - say and then we're going to go ahead and
105:29 - change up the price so we'll do right
105:31 - here
105:33 - item.price okay
105:36 - let's go ahead and save that oh jessie
105:39 - just suggested just adjust it just
105:40 - adjust it just adjust it to see
105:43 - okay oh hey i don't see your code i am
105:45 - the price
105:47 - right and honestly that's pretty much it
105:48 - at this point the only other thing that
105:50 - we have to do is do the quantity so
105:51 - let's go ahead and change this one to
105:52 - quantity
105:54 - right here item.quantity
105:59 - quantity save that that's looking all
106:02 - good and that name and that make
106:04 - and then add that image and we're all
106:06 - pretty much good look we have the images
106:08 - it's all looking great nothing bad so
106:10 - far so now we can replace
106:12 - html and actually put that into our what
106:14 - into our card.html
106:16 - so if i go back to it right if i go back
106:19 - i see my card items
106:21 - what class i'm going to use to replace
106:24 - the inner html4
106:26 - you guys tell me you guys tell me
106:30 - you guys should notice by now we've done
106:31 - this with the normal items what is it
106:34 - what is it it is going to which one card
106:37 - items right here
106:38 - that's right yes the card item so i'm
106:41 - going to copy this one
106:42 - go to card.js and i'm going to say
106:45 - document but this needs to have an
106:46 - outsider for each loop i will say no
106:50 - not inside here jesse outside the for
106:52 - each loop okay
106:54 - yeah it makes sense i'm gonna say
106:57 - document
106:58 - that query selector
107:01 - right that's something that card items
107:04 - all right dot what for each or two
107:08 - what we're thinking about for each inner
107:10 - html
107:11 - is equal to what is it items html right
107:14 - there so i'm going to say
107:15 - items no isn't it inside of the for loop
107:19 - because we want to add
107:21 - each item to the card items
107:28 - no actually it's fine it's fine like
107:29 - that
107:32 - it's fine yeah okay it's fine actually
107:34 - yep so there you go guys look we have 14
107:36 - nintendo switches
107:38 - 35 apple macbook pros
107:41 - that's pretty good but of course one
107:44 - thing i want you guys to pay attention
107:45 - to is
107:46 - this total cost is a wrong cost so when
107:48 - we do ironed our price
107:50 - what should be the actual price it
107:51 - should be what item that price
107:53 - times what you guys tell me oh it would
107:55 - be nice though to have
107:57 - 14 nintendo switches for the price of
107:59 - one yeah
108:00 - tell me what is it i'm waiting for you
108:01 - guys waiting for someone to be in the
108:03 - chat to say that to it come on what is
108:05 - it what is it what is it what is it what
108:06 - is it
108:06 - that's right times the quantity i doubt
108:09 - price times
108:10 - quan tt
108:13 - yes save that hey you see
108:17 - oh what happened here i know that
108:19 - quantity my bad item that quantity
108:21 - right there boom four thousand dollars
108:24 - and
108:24 - forty thousand dollars for 35 macbook
108:27 - pros so now you know
108:28 - if you ever want to buy 35 macbook pros
108:31 - it would actually cost you forty
108:33 - thousand dollars guys which is not a bad
108:35 - price tag at all
108:36 - get it while it's hot because it's gonna
108:38 - bon it's gonna be gone pretty soon okay
108:43 - that's like a commercial
108:46 - i like apple so that means we can go to
108:49 - college html guys
108:50 - and we can remove all of these little
108:52 - main products
108:53 - so let's remove this one card item we
108:55 - don't need that anymore
108:57 - let's remove another card item right
108:59 - here
109:01 - boom by nintendo switch right
109:05 - and that's it yeah now it's empty and so
109:06 - what i like to do actually in this case
109:08 - i like to say
109:10 - i shall do like this wait time time
109:14 - all right um cart
109:17 - items or cart items right here no card
109:21 - yep card items from let's get db
109:24 - that's it save yeah there you go look at
109:26 - that that's it guys
109:28 - but of course we're not done yet because
109:30 - now we need to make sure that this kind
109:32 - of stuff works so let me go and remove
109:33 - this stuff
109:34 - we need to make sure that this works
109:36 - this works and this works yeah
109:39 - so what is what are we gonna do to make
109:41 - that happen
109:44 - what are we going to do to make that
109:46 - happen well guys
109:48 - so as you know those little arrows
109:51 - are called chevrons right and yesterday
109:55 - we used those from the font awesome
109:58 - library
109:59 - so what you want to do is you want
110:02 - to click on that arrow and then either
110:04 - your amount your quantity
110:07 - increases or decreases
110:10 - correct that also means that that arrow
110:14 - should have event listener right of
110:16 - click
110:17 - because you're clicking upon it and boom
110:19 - something needs to happen
110:22 - correct so what you can do
110:25 - plus what else is important you need to
110:28 - know
110:29 - which item you click because you want to
110:31 - know if you click upon
110:33 - uh decreasing the nintendo switch you
110:35 - want to
110:36 - you know have 13 instead of 14.
110:39 - if you want to up it then it's going to
110:41 - be 15 or 60.
110:42 - that's right but you have to know it
110:44 - because apple macbook
110:46 - has way more it's 35 right not 14 or 15.
110:49 - that's right so what we do first is
110:52 - we're going to add another class
110:55 - to um the chef front
110:59 - actually that right now so here line 31
111:02 - pay attention guys we can say data
111:06 - hyphen id is equal to
111:11 - item dot id but why are we doing why we
111:14 - end data jesse
111:18 - why we end data why we have the data why
111:20 - are we doing this
111:22 - because when we add an event listener to
111:26 - this
111:27 - we can grab that data from this div
111:30 - that's right and why do we need that
111:32 - data yeah
111:34 - we need the data because we need to know
111:36 - exactly what
111:37 - cart item we want to increase or
111:39 - decrease
111:40 - that's right because of course right if
111:42 - you guys go back to firebase right
111:44 - this has a specific id and so does this
111:47 - and so we need to know exactly well what
111:49 - are we going to update
111:50 - are we going to increase the quantity
111:53 - for this
111:54 - nintendo or for this apple right and so
111:56 - that's what we need a specific
111:58 - id of when we click on these little
112:01 - icons right
112:02 - here right and so we can do that by
112:04 - simply just putting a data id
112:05 - inside html which we can grab
112:09 - later on and extract it so watch how we
112:12 - do that which is really cool
112:13 - so guys i added item ids on the left
112:16 - chef front and i added
112:18 - an item id on the right chef run so that
112:20 - will
112:21 - you know let us know what item we're
112:24 - going to be increasing and decreasing
112:26 - that's right correct so that said though
112:29 - this is not going to happen just out of
112:31 - nowhere right
112:33 - the chevrons they need they need to know
112:36 - when they're being clicked on so we're
112:38 - going to create
112:39 - event listeners okay for them so
112:43 - let's create a function called create
112:46 - event listeners
112:48 - okay okay let's do that right now yeah
112:51 - create event
112:52 - listeners whoop listeners
112:56 - okay like this and
113:00 - of course now that we want to call it we
113:01 - need to define it so here
113:03 - create event listeners
113:07 - and let's think about this guys what is
113:10 - it that we want to do
113:11 - we want to have we want to decrease
113:14 - we want to increase and we also want to
113:18 - delete
113:19 - those are all things that have to do
113:21 - with quantity right
113:22 - so what we do is let's
113:26 - do this we're going to create decrease
113:28 - buttons
113:31 - okay and what do you think these
113:33 - decrease buttons are equal to
113:36 - basically we're going to grab every
113:37 - single decrease a button
113:40 - we're going to grab it from the html and
113:42 - then we're going to add any click
113:44 - listener on that
113:45 - button but first we need to actually
113:47 - grab it so let's do it right now
113:49 - right so the decrease button is always
113:51 - the left chef run
113:52 - that's something that we know for sure
113:54 - correct so we called it here we called
113:57 - it class chef from left
113:59 - but we can also call it to be a bit more
114:01 - um
114:02 - descriptive instead of chevron left we
114:05 - can call it
114:07 - cart item decrease
114:10 - you see that what happens is
114:12 - highlighting and instead of chevron
114:14 - right
114:15 - we know that this one's always adding
114:18 - something so we're going to call this
114:20 - cart
114:21 - item increase okay
114:25 - like this that said
114:29 - when we're you know going to create
114:32 - event listeners for the buttons
114:34 - and we know that all of the decrease
114:36 - buttons all of the buttons that decrease
114:38 - the amount
114:39 - are d look guys
114:43 - document query selector
114:48 - and i'm gonna say oh i'm gonna get out
114:51 - all of them
114:52 - because look if you have more items in
114:54 - your card
114:55 - you want all left chef runs all
114:58 - left uh cart item decrease buttons you
115:01 - want all of them
115:02 - to be targeted right so that's why you
115:05 - got to use query selector all
115:07 - so let's do this card
115:10 - whoop card item
115:14 - decrease boom
115:17 - like this okay then
115:21 - very easy once you know how you did this
115:23 - for the decrease
115:24 - of course the increase is going to be
115:26 - easy okay just going to copy this
115:30 - paste it and then my little trick you're
115:33 - going to select the d
115:34 - e command d boom
115:37 - you're going to say i n increase so we
115:41 - have now selected
115:42 - all of the increased buttons you see
115:44 - that
115:45 - and of course not only that we're also
115:48 - going to be making
115:49 - the delete buttons so let's focus on
115:51 - that later jesse
115:53 - let's focus on that one later oh okay
115:57 - so that said guys now that
116:00 - we have the increase and the decrease
116:03 - what do you think we should be doing
116:06 - well like i said before right
116:08 - uh we're calling this multiple we're
116:10 - calling this buttons because if you have
116:12 - more items you have more decreased
116:14 - buttons
116:15 - so we're gonna loop through those
116:19 - okay and then for each button
116:24 - guess what we're gonna add an event
116:27 - listener so we know that something needs
116:30 - to be done
116:31 - when that button is being clicked on
116:33 - okay
116:34 - so button dot
116:38 - add event listener and guess what is the
116:40 - event guys what is the event
116:43 - that the button will be listening to
116:46 - click right the click event and let's
116:48 - think about this why are we using it for
116:49 - each loop right
116:51 - mainly reason b is because we have
116:52 - multiple chevrons we have multiple
116:54 - decrease buttons
116:55 - and so for every single button that we
116:57 - have here we're going to create the
116:59 - exact if same event listener but just
117:01 - with different data
117:03 - yeah just with different data
117:06 - so here i got the click okay i defined
117:10 - my
117:10 - event okay and once
117:13 - the click happens then decrease
117:17 - the count that's what we want this
117:20 - button
117:20 - to do and guess what this button
117:24 - hey now we're gonna be using the data
117:27 - set
117:28 - oh shoot what's that data set
117:31 - dot id but this data set is actually
117:35 - coming from where
117:36 - well because we're using data dash id
117:38 - which is right here
117:40 - this data dash id i'm getting the data
117:41 - id html gives us
117:44 - access to that so if i'm going to grab
117:46 - that button
117:47 - right for every single button i'm going
117:49 - to grab the button i'm going to give the
117:50 - data set
117:51 - the way to get the data id is to use
117:53 - button that data set
117:55 - and then whatever you want in our case
117:57 - it's the id whatever it is on here is
117:59 - what we're going to put so if i said
118:00 - if i put here apple i would say here
118:04 - dataset.apple apple understand does that
118:06 - make sense yeah
118:07 - so whatever it says on there is what
118:08 - we're going to grab that's why
118:12 - for sure and now guys we made the we
118:16 - we're calling a decrease count function
118:18 - but we haven't exactly made that yet so
118:20 - it's not going to do anything
118:22 - so let's go to the top of our of our
118:25 - card.js
118:26 - and here after the get card items let's
118:29 - create a function
118:30 - where we're actually decreasing the
118:32 - count okay so
118:34 - decrease count boom or
118:37 - giving that the item id now why do you
118:39 - think the item id is important guys
118:42 - oh no you tell me jesse well
118:46 - if i decrease i want to know exactly
118:48 - which item
118:49 - i am decreasing in quantity of right if
118:52 - i
118:52 - would click on the left chaff run of the
118:54 - nintendo switch
118:56 - i'm going to get 13 instead of 14.
118:59 - that's right
119:00 - right so guess what guys
119:03 - we gotta work with firestore again so
119:06 - i'm gonna say here card item
119:10 - is equal to db collection you guys know
119:14 - the drill
119:15 - card items and guess what
119:19 - we're grabbing that specific id
119:22 - card item by saying doc
119:26 - item id you see that now we got the
119:30 - specific document
119:31 - from the firestore now that we have that
119:35 - we're going to get it
119:36 - we're going to say cart item dot get
119:41 - then okay okay then
119:44 - and once we have that okay we're gonna
119:48 - be
119:48 - checking whether that document really
119:51 - exists
119:53 - okay like this
119:56 - if document exists because it might not
119:59 - exist
120:00 - might not most of cases will because
120:03 - it's in the actual card you know
120:05 - most of the time yeah but it might not
120:08 - so if it exists
120:12 - okay then what do we want to do guys if
120:14 - we want to decrease the amount
120:16 - what do we want to do we want what do we
120:18 - want to do we want to
120:19 - update the card item oh we want to
120:22 - update the quantity but
120:24 - if i um what should my
120:27 - amount at least be in order to decrease
120:30 - from it
120:31 - what does it do because we cannot let
120:33 - the item go down to zero
120:35 - right because that would completely
120:37 - delete it there's no point of doing that
120:38 - at that point
120:39 - we have to make sure that there's more
120:41 - than one card items right now
120:43 - or more quantity that we have to make
120:45 - sure there's more than one so that's
120:47 - very well said so doc
120:49 - dot data quantities bigger than one
120:54 - a and then we're going to do something
120:57 - now we're going to update it that's
120:59 - right
121:01 - now we're going to update it so now we
121:02 - say cart item dot
121:04 - update and we're going to update it with
121:07 - the following
121:08 - we're going to say quantity which is the
121:11 - you know the property inside of the
121:12 - firestore right what not has been making
121:14 - there
121:15 - and then we're going to say we could say
121:17 - minus 1
121:18 - but that's not really what we want why
121:21 - is that guys
121:24 - why is that because there's no point
121:28 - it's like minus one from what
121:30 - exactly minus one from what so tommy
121:33 - says
121:33 - that's great what you have but you want
121:35 - yours we're now
121:37 - we're going through it so you want to
121:39 - make it a little bit more dynamic
121:41 - and go like this you're saying dot data
121:45 - quantity
121:49 - minus one so you want to get the
121:52 - existing quantity but you want to
121:55 - decrease one of that that's it right and
121:58 - that's it
122:00 - that's it guys so now based on that
122:03 - let's see if it actually works jesse we
122:06 - have decreased count
122:08 - recalling decrease count inside here
122:10 - right
122:11 - all right are you guys ready shall we
122:13 - test this out guys i guess
122:14 - let's test this out log here oh i don't
122:18 - know but i'm just ready to test it out
122:19 - let's go let's say
122:20 - okay three okay two one let's go
122:26 - wait oh
122:29 - let's go hey look at that
122:33 - and even this total cost is decreasing
122:36 - also guys look at pay attention to this
122:39 - boom damn how cool is that huh
122:43 - did you guys enjoy that yeah
122:46 - anybody here confused raise your hand if
122:48 - you're confused
122:50 - pretty much everybody that's great
122:51 - that's awesome
122:52 - [Music]
122:54 - but are you learning a lot there you go
122:56 - see so guys
122:58 - we have got the actual chevron it's all
123:01 - working really well we're decreasing the
123:02 - count
123:03 - that is it my friends so now now let's
123:06 - work on the increase
123:07 - the count right let's look at the
123:09 - increased count all right
123:10 - so the increase is not that much
123:13 - different from the decrease
123:15 - okay so let's do it
123:18 - increase buttons i already
123:22 - uh we're doing there again we're doing
123:24 - the query selector oh we're selecting
123:25 - all right chevrons all the buttons that
123:28 - can increase the quantity
123:29 - and here look increase
123:32 - buttons we're gonna loop through those
123:35 - buttons
123:36 - okay button and of course also to this
123:41 - right
123:41 - chef front we're going to be adding an
123:42 - event listener so button
123:45 - dot add event listener and the event is
123:48 - gonna be
123:50 - guess what a click okay and once
123:53 - that click happens whoops once that
123:57 - clink happens
123:58 - we're gonna fire off a function okay and
124:01 - guess what that function is
124:03 - we're gonna increase the count with this
124:05 - function so
124:06 - increase count and
124:10 - what do we need to know when we're
124:12 - increasing something we need to know
124:13 - which
124:13 - which item it is so we're going to give
124:15 - them that data
124:17 - button that data set that i t
124:21 - now okay guys so we wrote we just wrote
124:24 - this
124:25 - okay so now we're going to wrote the
124:27 - increase function
124:28 - because that's what happens upon the
124:30 - click right so
124:31 - awesome increase count thank you nas
124:36 - mm-hmm we're going to give that the item
124:39 - id
124:41 - yes and then and
124:45 - again whoops we're going to get
124:48 - um that from first from the database
124:52 - from the firestore okay so just how we
124:55 - did it here
124:57 - we're going to the same thing here
124:59 - exactly and again we need a specific
125:03 - is id for the dock so we're going to say
125:05 - dock parentheses open and feed it
125:08 - the item id now that we have the card
125:11 - item
125:12 - we're going to get it oh get it
125:15 - like this and once we have it
125:18 - again like before we're going to check
125:20 - right
125:21 - whether that document really exists
125:25 - if doc dot exists
125:29 - okay what do we want to know guys when
125:32 - we're
125:33 - we want to add something to
125:36 - um we want to buy another macbook pro
125:39 - what is it that we actually need to do
125:41 - we need to update it correct
125:44 - but we want to update it even when
125:47 - even when it's zero but that's not
125:50 - we still want it right
125:54 - so the condition here should be
125:57 - dot data quantity
126:00 - is at least bigger than zero okay
126:05 - and then we're gonna update the cart
126:09 - like this boom now
126:13 - instead of decreasing or now increasing
126:16 - so what are we going to do guys
126:18 - let me know guys let me know in the chat
126:20 - guys well we're going to take the data
126:22 - doc.data.quantity jesse and then we're
126:24 - going to do plus one on that one guys
126:26 - okay
126:27 - yes that's right plus one that's right
126:31 - like this boom and that's it
126:33 - and so now if we save that let's see so
126:35 - let's see
126:36 - let's see if that works now have the
126:38 - increase count function right here just
126:40 - double check
126:41 - recall the increased count function here
126:43 - we have an event listener and every
126:44 - single button
126:45 - which is perfect if i do this now
126:49 - oh there's wait does it work it works
126:52 - let's go
126:54 - i do this and pay attention to this as
126:58 - well
126:58 - not only this works right not only does
127:01 - this work
127:01 - right right right here no does this work
127:05 - but this works as well and this works
127:08 - right
127:08 - so if i increase the count look at that
127:11 - fourteen thousand
127:12 - two thousand two thousand three hundred
127:14 - three six hundred and we just keep going
127:16 - keep going so we have
127:18 - everything working together beautifully
127:20 - we have six
127:22 - 56 items in our cart i know it's a lot
127:24 - of items guys
127:26 - i mean you know if you if you want the
127:28 - technology you want the tech you know
127:30 - you gotta get go
127:30 - for what you want yeah you gotta gotta
127:32 - go what you want for sure
127:34 - you know life's short so let's now go
127:36 - ahead and work on the functionality for
127:38 - the delete
127:39 - this delete button because of course we
127:40 - can only go to one so if i keep
127:42 - decreasing this number right here right
127:45 - right
127:46 - i just i can't go any lower because
127:47 - there's no point there's no point in me
127:49 - going lower
127:50 - only way to do is now just remove it
127:52 - from the actual thing
127:54 - so let's go ahead and instead of doing
127:56 - decrease buttons we'll do
127:58 - let delete buttons right
128:01 - right same thing we're going to grab
128:04 - every single button from the html that's
128:06 - inside here
128:07 - right like this grab every single button
128:10 - that's inside right here grab that from
128:14 - the html
128:15 - and we're going to add an event listener
128:16 - so i'm saying document
128:20 - document the query selector all
128:23 - right here that's going to grab us all
128:25 - of those specific html elements okay
128:28 - all right and then we'll do like this
128:32 - what is the class name called it's
128:34 - called card item delete right there
128:36 - but of course remember we have to know
128:38 - what we're going to get data from so
128:39 - what's that we need to put this data id
128:42 - also for the card item delete
128:45 - boom save that that way when we click on
128:48 - it we have the functionality too
128:50 - so let's do that right now let's go back
128:52 - to our daily buttons
128:54 - dot what card i delete right here
128:57 - two to two
129:00 - card item delete which is let me see
129:02 - where is it where is the reserve is it
129:04 - it's going to be card item delete right
129:07 - here command c
129:09 - command v to paste it in there beautiful
129:12 - so now we're going to grab all the
129:14 - buttons and i want to show you exactly
129:15 - what's happening here i'm going to
129:16 - console log
129:19 - delete buttons that way you understand
129:21 - what's actually going on
129:22 - when we do document the query to all and
129:24 - i want you to pay attention to this
129:25 - really closely okay so guys listen up
129:27 - please
129:27 - listen up if you're here listen up i
129:30 - will right click inspect that one on
129:32 - this one
129:33 - let me put the right hand side let's go
129:35 - to console
129:37 - put on the left hand side oh right here
129:40 - you see these buttons right here look
129:43 - when i do
129:44 - the query selector all this is what it's
129:47 - giving me
129:48 - we have what we have this one div you
129:50 - can see it's even highlighting it inside
129:52 - our html i have another div so it
129:54 - literally got me the html element i
129:57 - think if it's an object think of an html
129:58 - almond is like a cup
130:00 - right right and we just kind of got
130:02 - whatever is in this cup
130:04 - and we cannot use whatever is in that
130:06 - cup that's literally all that happened
130:08 - the same thing happens when we do when
130:10 - we do what
130:11 - the increase buttons and when we do the
130:14 - decrease buttons
130:15 - right same thing happens there so now
130:18 - what we are going to do is
130:19 - with delete buttons we're going to use
130:21 - them
130:22 - okay then i'm going to do delete buttons
130:27 - right dot add event listener
130:30 - so three buttons
130:33 - buttons dot
130:37 - for each like this right
130:40 - for every single button that we are
130:42 - going to grab from the html
130:45 - right so it's going to be every single
130:47 - button right here
130:49 - we'll do button dot
130:53 - add event listener right there
130:56 - beautiful we'll say click
131:00 - boom and i will say function
131:03 - okay function and now we'll be able to
131:07 - actually
131:08 - call delete count so let's do delete
131:11 - item and we'll pass in the what
131:15 - the button that data set
131:20 - that id all right let's go ahead and
131:23 - create this delete item function
131:26 - we have the increased count ooh let's
131:28 - remove this what is this i'm not sure
131:29 - this is this is interesting
131:31 - let's create a function called delete
131:32 - item
131:36 - function delete item
131:40 - item right here let's pass the item id
131:44 - boom and now jesse what are we going to
131:47 - do inside this delete item
131:48 - delete item functionality jesse well
131:52 - um you want of course to know
131:55 - which item in its total will be removed
131:59 - from your cart right so
132:02 - we can actually ask firestore to hey
132:06 - the document uh the item that i'm gonna
132:09 - give you the id that i'm gonna give you
132:10 - i want that to be removed
132:13 - okay so you can go to
132:16 - um wait a moment so you can either look
132:19 - up in a firebase documentation
132:21 - you know like hey how to remove a
132:22 - document but this is how you do it
132:25 - so inside of your delete account or
132:28 - delete item
132:29 - you're going to indeed you're going to
132:30 - target the cart items collection
132:32 - you're going gonna say doc you're gonna
132:34 - give it that specific item id
132:36 - and then super easy you're just gonna
132:38 - say dot delete
132:40 - parentheses okay and then we're gonna
132:43 - wait for that
132:47 - and that's it we have that delete
132:51 - right that's working all well give you
132:54 - the collection
132:55 - the card item do the trick dot delete
132:58 - and that's it guys okay
133:00 - so now let's try it out that means we're
133:01 - going to remove the element from the
133:03 - from the card items
133:04 - let's shut out right now if i will click
133:06 - this button
133:07 - let's see if it actually works three
133:11 - two one what
133:14 - oh there we go guys it deleted the item
133:20 - that's it and because delete the item it
133:22 - actually decreased the count
133:23 - of here and of course it decreased the
133:25 - total cost right that's here
133:27 - so now let's let's add another item to
133:28 - here let's go back to our amazon
133:30 - that you should let's go back to
133:31 - index.html we should really create a
133:34 - link to go back home
133:35 - let's add a nintendo switch back right
133:39 - which we'll add it to here let me go
133:41 - back to cart and nintendo back right
133:43 - right here let me delete delete
133:45 - one more time pay attention to the card
133:47 - count
133:48 - boom done you see we removed it and so
133:51 - now if we go back again to the
133:53 - html right let's add it one more time
133:56 - let's see boom done it's there
133:59 - that's it guys that's it that's right
134:02 - samir we're gonna we should do an a
134:03 - strap
134:04 - so guys look the decrease is working the
134:06 - increase is working right
134:08 - the delete is working there's one last
134:10 - thing that we need to do
134:12 - to fully make this perfectly functional
134:14 - i mean not perfectly
134:16 - but amazingly functional okay that's
134:19 - going to be this number right here this
134:20 - total count
134:21 - right we need to get hey what is the
134:23 - actual total cost of the sum of the all
134:25 - the card items so because of course you
134:27 - want to know that
134:28 - hey you know what i'm about to spend a
134:30 - thousand dollars on this whole thing
134:32 - right otherwise that'd be pretty bad so
134:34 - we need to create a
134:35 - get total count get to the cost
134:38 - functionality let's do that
134:41 - i'm going to say here function i'll say
134:44 - get
134:45 - total cost okay
134:49 - okay get total cost i'm going to
134:52 - grab the items whatever items i'm going
134:55 - to be given so maybe
134:56 - i will call this function inside my get
134:59 - car items because i have access to all
135:01 - of the items
135:03 - and then i'm going to call get total
135:05 - cost
135:06 - right and i'm going to pass in the items
135:09 - or the card items my bad
135:12 - oh right there okay so let's do that
135:16 - okay let's initially start up total cost
135:18 - with let total cost
135:20 - cost is equal to zero all right
135:23 - let's loop through every single item so
135:25 - we'll say items
135:27 - dot for each for each
135:30 - okay now for each i'm going to say
135:33 - like this dot dot dot oh sorry nash
135:37 - sorry jesse run hold on hold on hold
135:41 - hold on hold on hold on
135:42 - hold on hold the phone hold on
135:47 - so item okay
135:50 - then beside that we're going to do jesse
135:52 - inside that
135:54 - well you want to add the cost
135:57 - of each item so total cost and since
136:01 - we're looping through this yes exactly
136:03 - total cost plus
136:04 - equal item quantity
136:07 - quantity what is it guys tell me times
136:10 - what is the total cost
136:13 - come on it's not that hard what do we
136:15 - add to here to make this work
136:18 - you know it did i just i just said it
136:20 - come on no you did not wait hold
136:22 - on let them say it come on
136:26 - come on guys come on come on come on
136:27 - come on come on no
136:29 - what is it what is it i don't know we
136:31 - don't have the total cost
136:33 - that's right quantity times price
136:37 - we have access to the quantity one
136:40 - times the price so what do we do
136:44 - we have item dot
136:47 - price multiply by item dot
136:51 - quantity and that is it okay and this is
136:54 - your asmr version
136:56 - of the amazon clone okay
136:59 - then what we're gonna do is we'll go
137:01 - ahead and since we have the total cost
137:04 - i'm going to update that inside the
137:06 - whole the whole
137:08 - what inside this thing right here okay
137:11 - so to do that let's go back to
137:14 - covercut.html
137:15 - okay let's scroll down and you can see
137:18 - that this is the actual
137:20 - text that we need to update well to
137:22 - update that we need to give it a certain
137:24 - class so let's give it a class
137:25 - let's say the class is going to be total
137:28 - cost number
137:29 - total dash cost dash number okay you
137:32 - guys ready
137:33 - good total cost number okay
137:36 - are you okay are you ready let's go back
137:39 - to
137:39 - cart at
137:52 - okay prayer selector let's grab that div
137:56 - okay let's grab the div and we'll go and
137:58 - say
137:59 - that total cost cost number
138:02 - i'm kidding that total cost number right
138:06 - that inner text right in our text
138:11 - is going to be the total cost that we
138:13 - calculate
138:16 - save that and that's it now we have the
138:19 - price this is the total cost but let's
138:21 - do we're like this we have the total
138:22 - cost is going to be
138:23 - let's use string literals to actually
138:25 - create this there we go
138:27 - two looney tunes that's right
138:32 - there we go so like this right here
138:36 - let's use the tata
138:39 - total cost command x let's put that
138:42 - inside here
138:43 - let's also use the dollar sign to make
138:46 - sure that we actually use a dollar sign
138:47 - don't tone
138:49 - and boom 5 hundred and fourteen dollars
138:52 - is a total cost so if i
138:54 - increase the macbook pros to what fifty
138:56 - five thousand
138:57 - actually sixty thousand dollars sixty
138:59 - two thousand dollars sixty five
139:01 - let's keep going sixty seventy thousand
139:02 - dollars 73
139:05 - seventy seven seventy eight seventy nine
139:07 - eight hundred how many
139:08 - people go let's do it right now how many
139:10 - can we go can we go to 100k 100k
139:13 - 100k and we're a hundred thousand
139:15 - dollars officially
139:18 - that's right guys and we have 88 car
139:20 - items and we are buying 87 macbook pros
139:24 - there you go 87 macbook pros
139:28 - that's it so guys that's pretty much it
139:30 - i mean i mean it's not it i have a few
139:32 - few more tweaks we want to do oh look
139:34 - we've got the card items they're working
139:36 - really well everything is showing up the
139:38 - way it needs to be
139:39 - the one thing i want to fix now is i
139:41 - really hate how these numbers are
139:42 - showing up okay
139:44 - do you guys agree with that one i don't
139:45 - like the fact that it's like there's not
139:47 - formatted nothing
139:48 - so to make that work we're going to use
139:50 - something called pneumodo.js so numeral
139:53 - that yes check this out right all right
139:56 - right numero sam is like you need my
139:58 - address i'm in my book pro
140:00 - guys that's right we're sending
140:02 - everybody macbook pros guys
140:04 - just kidding it's not it's not a promise
140:06 - at all
140:08 - we'd be bankrupt if we did that
140:11 - so let's do that right now right i'm
140:14 - going to
140:14 - copy a new.js again this is what was
140:17 - going to help us
140:18 - um actually format the numbers
140:22 - right it's just a javascript library
140:23 - that we're going to use and i will copy
140:25 - this one for you i'll put it to you guys
140:26 - in the chat
140:27 - those you guys who are on youtube just
140:29 - go to email.js and you'll see it in
140:30 - there okay
140:32 - all right beautiful then what's going to
140:33 - happen let's put that inside our
140:35 - card.html
140:37 - let's go to our card.html hopefully you
140:39 - guys can see that
140:40 - and let's put it underneath the
140:41 - header.js actually let's put it inside
140:43 - uh
140:45 - our gs like this oh what happened here
140:50 - nope uh copy
140:54 - fancy but yeah this is bad now okay
140:58 - there we go
140:59 - command c command v and so this gives us
141:01 - the actual numeral gs and in order to
141:03 - use numer.js it kind of works like this
141:05 - right
141:06 - you kind of give it a number right here
141:08 - you see that right there
141:10 - you give it a number and then you say
141:12 - format and then you tell what how do you
141:14 - want to format so for example if i want
141:15 - to format it in a number sign
141:17 - kind of like that then i just use this
141:20 - format so let's do that right now
141:22 - if i go to my card.html right and if i
141:25 - go to
141:26 - let's just say card.js i need to form a
141:28 - total cost
141:30 - i'm going to use the actual the whole
141:32 - thing so i'm going to say
141:33 - like this instead of doing the inner
141:35 - text i'm going to say
141:37 - numeral watch this guys numeral
141:41 - right numeral
141:45 - numeral i will give it a number right
141:48 - total cost dot format
141:52 - right and then what we're going to put
141:54 - inside the format we're just going to
141:56 - put this right here
141:57 - right there that's it oh what just
142:00 - happened
142:01 - i'm going to put that right there boom
142:04 - that's it so let me go and make this a
142:06 - little bit smaller so
142:07 - you guys can see that beautiful and
142:09 - that's it guys so let me go and save
142:11 - this for you
142:12 - let's go back to our amazon go back to
142:15 - our cart
142:16 - and look at that a hundred thousand 253
142:19 - a beautifully formatted number
142:21 - i love the way that just works right the
142:23 - same thing can happen with the other
142:24 - stuff so let's go ahead and change the
142:25 - number that's
142:26 - here which i really don't like as well
142:28 - same thing let's use the numeral
142:31 - let's go down to where we add that which
142:33 - is going to be down inside the html
142:36 - and this will give the quantity let's
142:38 - also use that here
142:40 - so i'm going to set a sort of item price
142:41 - i'm going to do like this
142:46 - right there numeral format and instead
142:49 - of the total cost
142:50 - we're just going to use item price times
142:52 - i'm the quantity right there
142:53 - boom you see so now we can just delete
142:56 - all this right here
142:58 - save that boom 209.99963
143:04 - is the cost of our whole situation you
143:06 - see
143:07 - look very clean very nice informative
143:10 - beautifully formatted
143:12 - that's so good now let's now go back to
143:14 - our home page and i think to go back to
143:16 - our homepage we should probably make a
143:17 - link so let's create a link right now
143:19 - because i'm really sick with the fact
143:20 - that we don't have a link
143:21 - let's go to card.html to link
143:25 - our actual um logo right
143:28 - we can just do like this we'll do look
143:31 - a shrek
143:34 - ashraf is equal to
143:38 - index.html boom
143:41 - like that command x and put it inside
143:45 - around the in the logo image
143:47 - boom that's it boom
143:50 - save beautiful right so we just put a
143:53 - link around
143:54 - our uh card image that way we can just
143:56 - go back so if i want to go back
143:59 - now we're back at home and that my
144:01 - friends is it and so now i can actually
144:03 - go add to cart again
144:04 - you see now this increase it to 90 right
144:06 - here
144:07 - let's format out these numbers because
144:08 - again i just hate the way it's being
144:10 - formatted
144:11 - right that means we need to go back to
144:13 - our script.js because again remember if
144:15 - we go to script.js
144:17 - right way to perform the number it's
144:20 - inside
144:20 - right here the item price all right now
144:22 - of course we need to include
144:24 - um that cdn first and numerol.js inside
144:26 - our index.html so let's go into html
144:30 - let's include it inside here
144:33 - and make sure to include before
144:34 - everything else or try to do that
144:37 - and we'll do it like the following cdn
144:40 - cloudflare ajax right here
144:42 - this new number.js and again you can get
144:44 - that from
144:46 - right here okay
144:49 - let's go back go back to here jks
144:53 - right there save that let's go back to
144:55 - script.js
144:57 - right here yeah and instead of using
144:59 - iron.price we're going to do what
145:01 - jesse let's say what we're going to say
145:03 - numeral
145:05 - yes and then item.price
145:08 - we're gonna format that so we're gonna
145:11 - give it a d
145:12 - format and then single quotes dollar
145:15 - sign
145:17 - exactly zero comma zero dot zero zero so
145:20 - you're giving it a format so that way it
145:22 - knows
145:23 - how to format your numbers and that's it
145:26 - that's it guys
145:27 - and that my friends is the end of the
145:30 - amazon clone 2.0
145:35 - this has been a really
145:38 - really really long one but it's okay

146:15 - challenge we can do stripe i think that
146:17 - would be really interesting is we
146:18 - continue on this amazon clone
146:20 - right i want to show you how do we go
146:23 - ahead and remove this and make this
146:25 - mobile friendly
146:26 - all right oh that's right that's right
146:28 - so let's do that i want to show you how
146:30 - do we make it mobile friendly okay
146:32 - a few ways well if we go to index.html
146:37 - all right look at our categories where
146:39 - are the categories rather here
146:41 - right there right there you see sidebar
146:44 - and our main sidebar is here well what
146:47 - we can do
146:48 - is we can basically hide it so imagine
146:50 - like this
146:52 - when we have a small screen right let's
146:54 - just say
146:55 - the screen is small right we make this a
147:00 - hidden
147:02 - a hidden or you know display none kind
147:04 - of display not right
147:06 - it's kind of like here okay it's hidden
147:09 - right
147:10 - this is a small screen right what
147:12 - happens is
147:13 - after it becomes small after it becomes
147:15 - a median screen
147:16 - then we want to show it
147:20 - okay and then we want to show it
147:24 - right now
147:27 - this is how it works until when css i
147:29 - can tell like this you see how
147:30 - we have this main sidebar i can say
147:33 - hidden here
147:35 - hidden measure this out
147:39 - see it's hidden it's no longer there
147:40 - it's done adios
147:42 - sayonara baby let's go all right
147:45 - but i can say hey when it becomes median
147:48 - size i can say block
147:51 - so basically if the size of the screen
147:54 - is median
147:55 - medium see right there now it's block so
147:58 - it's
147:59 - from minimum of medium size it's blocked
148:01 - but then when i get to a small screen
148:04 - it's disappearing see and then my
148:07 - friends is how you make it
148:08 - mobile friendly that's it and so that's
148:12 - pretty much it my friends let's do the
148:13 - same thing actually let's do the same
148:15 - thing to our card.html
148:18 - [Music]
148:19 - okay let's go back to record.html
148:22 - the same thing here
148:26 - and put inside here so that way if we go
148:28 - to car.html
148:29 - same thing here if we make this smaller
148:34 - boom there we go it just kind of shuts
148:37 - off and that's
148:38 - it and of course there's more things so
148:40 - my challenge to you
148:41 - uh at this point is gonna be really
148:42 - simple guys i challenge you to make this
148:44 - mobile friendly
148:46 - yeah right let me say how about doing a
148:48 - dark mode that'd be great you guys
