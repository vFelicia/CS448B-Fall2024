00:01 - see here from clever programmer calm I
00:04 - know free code camp is absolutely
00:06 - amazing so I had to just decide it to
00:08 - come on here jump on it and just run
00:12 - through it a little bit and based on
00:13 - your guys's feedback maybe we'll
00:15 - continue this series if there is no
00:18 - feedback we won't just as simple as that
00:20 - so let's just jump into it okay this is
00:24 - going over some HTML stuff what is HTML
00:27 - HTML is what lets you see everything
00:29 - that you see on the Internet so the text
00:33 - over here on this side that I'm
00:35 - highlighting is written in HTML on the
00:37 - right hand side it's showing an example
00:39 - of how HTML works and let me just show
00:42 - you so for example you see this hello is
00:45 - wrapped in something called tags and
00:47 - specifically these are actually h1 tags
00:49 - it also stands for header 1 tags now if
00:52 - I remove these tags it'll turn into
00:54 - regular text that you're used to seeing
00:55 - and it's gonna be written very small
00:58 - here on the cell phone very very small
01:00 - but now let's wrap this bad boy in an h1
01:03 - tag and you'll see that it becomes big
01:06 - now what if I took this thing and did
01:09 - header 6 okay that's header 6 tag and
01:13 - you see it's pretty small so header 6 is
01:15 - the smallest header size and header 1 is
01:17 - the biggest header size okay generally
01:20 - when I'm using header sizes I'll go with
01:22 - header 2 very few times I'll actually
01:25 - use header 1 a lot of times it helps me
01:28 - when I'm writing my blog posts you know
01:29 - I'll put something in header 2 and I'll
01:31 - say something like what programming
01:34 - language should I learn first which is
01:38 - one of my videos if you haven't watched
01:39 - it go watch it because awesome and then
01:41 - right underneath it I'll open a
01:42 - paragraph tag and I'll be like a world
01:47 - what is uh you know and here I'll just
01:50 - kind of write my paragraph so these are
01:51 - also called paragraph tags and when
01:54 - you're writing paragraphs you should put
01:56 - it within these tags that's kind of nice
01:58 - now what's cool about these tags is that
01:59 - you can even have the stuff like this
02:02 - and be writing here but as you can see
02:07 - on the right hand side it all looks like
02:09 - it's kind of on as if you were almost
02:11 - writing it all on one line so you might
02:13 - as well just put the here
02:15 - in this location but because it's
02:18 - wrapped up in P tags it really doesn't
02:21 - matter where it is because this P tag
02:23 - the closing P tag knows if it's location
02:25 - and puts it right there which is kind of
02:27 - nice if you ask me because then stuff
02:30 - can't get messed up really easily you
02:32 - know like you'll take something from
02:33 - word document try to copy paste it
02:35 - somewhere else and you know all that
02:36 - highlighting and all that beautiful
02:38 - stuff that you did gets all screwed up
02:40 - well that does not happen here because
02:43 - it's written in code and when you copy
02:46 - paste this code pretty much anywhere
02:47 - else where this code gets accepted it
02:50 - all works just fine now let me show you
02:53 - an example of HTML where actually you
02:55 - can have it on your own computer and
02:56 - write your own file or actually it'll
02:58 - fire up in the browser and look really
03:00 - sexy for you and it will look super nice
03:03 - and you can actually go ahead play
03:05 - around with it and add some more
03:07 - features and functionality to it so for
03:09 - example let's go and open up some
03:12 - regular text editor okay I have sublime
03:14 - text
03:15 - you don't need sublime text but if you
03:17 - want get sublime text that's cool you
03:19 - know and all the developers and all the
03:21 - cool guys and cool girls use it so I'm
03:24 - gonna just write hello world in here
03:27 - okay and I'm gonna close it with h1 tags
03:31 - I'm gonna save it as hello dot HTML and
03:35 - let's call it CP for a clever programmer
03:38 - and remember to save it as a dot HTML
03:42 - file and I'm actually going to save it
03:44 - um I don't know let's save it in the
03:46 - desktop I have a lot of stuff in the
03:48 - desktop but let's just save it there so
03:50 - here I saved it and it understands its
03:54 - HTML which is why it highlighted the h1
03:55 - so gorgeously and let's just go over
03:59 - here open a new tab and we're are going
04:02 - to go to desktop hello underscore CPI
04:05 - HTML and you can actually see that file
04:07 - right there right that's pretty cool but
04:10 - what is even cooler than that well let
04:13 - me show you so let me actually put this
04:15 - on the right side of the screen let me
04:17 - put this HTML file on the left side of
04:19 - the screen and let me add thanks to this
04:21 - so let's say I say what is up
04:26 - you know something like that close the P
04:29 - tags save the file go over here refresh
04:32 - and that stuff is there now let's say I
04:35 - want to take an image and add it so
04:36 - let's look up I don't know coding
04:41 - no no not coding for entrepreneurs
04:43 - coding just that's it so I'm gonna look
04:47 - that up and I'm gonna go to images and
04:49 - let's take whatever image we find so
04:51 - let's say we find this image right
04:52 - pretty cool image and we are going to
04:58 - copy the link of that image okay here's
05:02 - the link to that image and then what
05:05 - we're going to do is we're actually
05:06 - going to embed this image well or or
05:10 - make a link of this image and that's
05:13 - pretty easy to do we do H H ref put it
05:16 - in here and then we just close that tag
05:20 - okay close that tag but in between this
05:22 - tag we can put something interesting we
05:25 - can say click here for coding image okay
05:36 - something like that we'll save we'll go
05:38 - back to our website we'll hit refresh
05:39 - and you see the link is here now when
05:42 - you click that link it actually takes
05:44 - you to this coding image how cool is
05:47 - that
05:48 - pretty pretty cool I think so that's how
05:52 - you add you know your your HTML tags or
05:56 - whatever okay and in the next video I'll
05:59 - show you guys some other stuff let me
06:00 - know what you guys think of this video
06:02 - you guys like my face not being in it if
06:04 - you like this more go ahead and give it
06:06 - a little thumbs up so I hide my face
06:08 - more and I give you guys just some juicy
06:11 - juicy information alright let me know
06:14 - what you guys think of this format I
06:15 - just need some feedback and I'll be sure
06:18 - to add some more of this goodness
06:20 - take care I love you guys else and I'll
06:23 - see you in the next
