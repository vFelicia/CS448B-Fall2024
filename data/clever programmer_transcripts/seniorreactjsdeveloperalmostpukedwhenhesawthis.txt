00:00 - eww
00:01 - dude what
00:06 - what's up how's it going this is kazzy
00:09 - let's get into a little bit of a story
00:10 - time here so the other day the craziest
00:12 - thing happened i was sitting on this
00:14 - chair here and i had a developer friend
00:17 - come over and he was coding it up and
00:19 - he's you know by far one of the best
00:22 - developers i've ever seen in my life
00:24 - like his knowledge of react is
00:26 - absolutely insane and he understands the
00:29 - api probably almost as good as dan
00:32 - abramov or dan yeah i'm probably saying
00:34 - his name wrong but he's the founder of
00:37 - uh you know he created redux and he
00:39 - everybody refers to him when it comes to
00:40 - react like all things reaction is like
00:42 - dan abramov is the god of react and when
00:45 - i was sitting with uh this gentleman
00:47 - this developer who's really really good
00:49 - he was killing it you know he's he's
00:51 - going through he's showing me a lot of
00:52 - like little hacks uh he was showing me a
00:55 - lot about typescript and how typescript
00:57 - is so useful and how he him as a senior
01:00 - engineer at his company he uses
01:02 - typescript all of a sudden out of you
01:03 - know he was coding on this computer he
01:05 - saw the fat cursor show up
01:08 - in in visual studio code as he's coding
01:10 - he's like
01:15 - and i'm sitting here and i'm like dude
01:17 - what and he just goes crazy he sees vim
01:20 - and he just can't handle it you know
01:21 - he's like this is gross
01:24 - he's like but all all right that's fine
01:25 - that's fine no matter and then he just
01:27 - keeps going and he keeps getting so
01:29 - annoyed and bothered by vim you know
01:30 - every time he's like typing he's like oh
01:32 - hit escape interesting it turns into a
01:35 - fat cursor again
01:36 - you know and uh again super awesome dude
01:39 - love the guy he's he's amazing i i'm
01:42 - even thinking about bringing him on the
01:43 - channel and actually teaching certain
01:44 - things but it got me thinking i'm like
01:46 - what's up with all this [ __ ] hate
01:48 - with them dude like
01:50 - what the [ __ ] is going on and you know
01:52 - i've seen this so many times with so
01:54 - many people like my friend david who
01:56 - works with us a clever programmer him
01:58 - too he's just always like god sucks you
02:00 - know i wouldn't use them ever and most
02:02 - developers that i know or have worked
02:04 - with they don't use them or they run
02:06 - away from them or they're talking [ __ ]
02:08 - about them and what i realized is most
02:10 - of them don't actually even know them
02:12 - and haven't even used it that much but
02:15 - they have so much against it and you
02:17 - know i just wanted to talk about it a
02:18 - little bit like it you know vim is not
02:21 - that gross okay and it's not disgusting
02:23 - and it's not ugh like what the [ __ ] is
02:25 - this i've been using vim for so many
02:27 - years of my life here's what i'll tell
02:29 - you vim is
02:31 - literally one of the most beautiful
02:33 - amazing things you could ever
02:36 - do in your life like it's is like
02:38 - mind-blowing once you figure it out it's
02:40 - like whoa
02:42 - it's a whole new world it is your
02:45 - everyday your coding right and you're
02:46 - doing whatever you want but like if you
02:48 - start using vim it's like putting on
02:49 - these like psychedelic glasses and all
02:52 - of a sudden the whole world is just like
02:53 - oh like probably how joe rogan views and
02:55 - you're like whoa this is crazy i can do
02:57 - anything i can become anybody that i
02:59 - want
03:00 - it's that crazy of a difference let's
03:02 - use it i've never used any psychedelics
03:04 - so but that's besides the point but what
03:06 - i'm trying to say is when you do use vim
03:09 - it opens up a whole new world of
03:11 - possibilities for you and it is just so
03:13 - freaking fun to use and it will speed
03:17 - you up so much like as a developer you
03:20 - will go so fast so fast and what i
03:24 - always think when it comes to becoming a
03:25 - better developer is really you know
03:27 - there's different types of learning but
03:28 - one of the most common ways we learn as
03:30 - human beings is through trial and error
03:32 - so if vim allows you to essentially
03:34 - double your speed and i promise it'll
03:36 - allow you to weigh more than double your
03:38 - speed but even if it allowed you to just
03:40 - double your speed you've essentially
03:42 - doubled the speed of your trial and
03:44 - error which means you'll learn twice as
03:46 - fast and you'll improve your skill twice
03:48 - as fast which means you'll be able to
03:50 - get to your job twice as fast
03:56 - and that sounds hopefully to you amazing
03:58 - and something like you should want to do
04:00 - and you probably should do it and learn
04:02 - it now here's the thing and here's the
04:03 - catch with vim it has a slow learning
04:06 - curve it will mess you up when you are
04:08 - learning them okay it will slow you down
04:10 - your productivity will be a lot slower
04:12 - you'll be making a lot slow progress and
04:14 - that part about them is frustrating okay
04:16 - that part is frustrating it'll get to
04:18 - you it'll make you mad it'll make you
04:20 - angry but that's just the name of the
04:22 - game all right so the start there's a
04:24 - learning curve that'll slow you down a
04:25 - lot it has a steep learning curve but
04:27 - once you're used to it right your
04:29 - productivity will go down so if you
04:31 - start using vim today in your visual
04:32 - studio code or wherever and there are
04:34 - extensions you can go to visual studio
04:36 - code and just download an extension for
04:37 - them right and you go into it you start
04:39 - using it it'll like shoot your
04:41 - productivity down into the freaking
04:42 - ground it's almost like if you just
04:44 - started uh you know if you started
04:46 - learning how to write with your left
04:47 - hand or something it's almost like that
04:49 - kind of okay but once you become good at
04:51 - it then it's it is crazy it's it's the
04:54 - same as if you were able to like write
04:56 - with both hands at the same time so that
04:58 - learning curve just takes a little bit
05:00 - of time now here are a couple of things
05:02 - that i will tell you about vim that'll
05:03 - save you a ton of time all right if you
05:06 - want to get into it you want to jump
05:07 - into this world what i would recommend
05:09 - is go play there's this vim game online
05:12 - it's called vim golf i believe go play
05:14 - that go play this vim game online and
05:16 - it's like you have a character and you
05:18 - move them around with vim shortcuts and
05:20 - [ __ ] like that so play that and just
05:22 - have fun you'll learn how to move up
05:24 - down left and right which is not with
05:26 - your arrow keys it's gonna be with
05:28 - different keys okay so in vim you move
05:30 - around with hjkl okay h jkl so it's like
05:34 - weird and i was like hey h is moving you
05:36 - in weird directions and then jk is
05:38 - moving in l is moving in real direction
05:40 - so
05:41 - literally one of the most
05:43 - beautiful
05:44 - amazing things you could ever do in your
05:47 - life it'll throw you off you're like why
05:49 - am i moving like this but just play just
05:51 - play just play it until it's like
05:52 - pattern recognition habit and then you
05:55 - can bring that skill into your you know
05:58 - when you start coding i'll give you
05:59 - certain few key things to get started
06:02 - with all right but my goal is to get you
06:04 - to start using them and start actually
06:07 - just playing with it making mistakes
06:09 - having fun so i promise you it'll speed
06:11 - up your productivity like crazy all
06:13 - right so let's say you installed it in
06:14 - your visual studio code okay you go to
06:16 - your extensions shortcut is command
06:18 - shift x or on windows probably control
06:20 - shift x you go to your extensions you
06:22 - download them right and then you go back
06:24 - to your code and then it's like if you
06:26 - see that fat blinking arrow thing that's
06:28 - the mode people don't like being in
06:30 - that's like vim mode just hit i or a and
06:33 - that'll just like put you in regular
06:35 - mode okay and then you can just like
06:37 - code regularly how you normally code
06:40 - okay so you'll be totally fine if you
06:42 - hit escape it'll put you back into vim
06:45 - mode alright so that's just me teaching
06:47 - you how you get in and get out of it
06:50 - okay and then the other few things you
06:52 - need to know is ajkl how to move around
06:54 - and the nice thing is once you learn it
06:56 - your fingers never leave like their
06:58 - default position on the keyboard so you
07:00 - never have to go towards the arrow keys
07:03 - ever to move around anywhere you just
07:04 - stay in the home like default typing
07:08 - position and that will make you a lot
07:10 - more efficient and faster outside of
07:11 - that you know if you want to delete a
07:13 - line just hit d twice just try that
07:16 - it'll like delete the whole line all
07:18 - right if you want to copy an entire line
07:20 - just press y twice right and then go
07:22 - down somewhere and hit p it'll paste it
07:25 - as long as you're in vim mode all these
07:26 - vim commands work which means your
07:29 - cursor should be looking fat when your
07:30 - cursor looks fat you're in vim mode and
07:33 - then there are tons of other commands
07:35 - for you to know but i don't even want
07:36 - you to worry about that right now like
07:37 - in the start just learn to move around
07:39 - with ajkl it'll be weird but you'll get
07:41 - used to it all right dd to delete a line
07:44 - slash it also kind of copies it for you
07:46 - okay so you can paste it somewhere else
07:48 - yy to yank
07:50 - slash copy align p to paste those are
07:52 - some basic basic commands to get started
07:55 - with and then to go in and out of modes
07:58 - ina there's like a whole bunch of stuff
08:00 - okay i don't want to like overwhelm you
08:02 - and go into a full-on vim tutorial right
08:06 - here if you guys want to want to see
08:08 - that or want to see like how you use it
08:10 - with react or whatever let me know in
08:12 - the comments but look like as a
08:13 - developer as a front-end developer or
08:15 - whatever like even if you're doing react
08:17 - i think you should use vim in your code
08:20 - and i think it'll make you faster you'll
08:22 - start building components faster you'll
08:24 - like be able to move around the
08:26 - parentheses faster change the arguments
08:28 - fast it will just overall make your life
08:31 - easier in my opinion and uh you'll just
08:33 - feel like this badass hacker you know
08:36 - you just have this dope ass vibe about
08:38 - you that's why i like it okay so go out
08:41 - there go crazy have fun use it and uh in
08:44 - the comments below let me know if you
08:46 - use vim or if you're gonna start using
08:48 - vim or if you want see me make another
08:51 - video on vim and go deep dive whatever
08:53 - it is drop it in the comments below let
08:55 - me know if this is something you're
