00:18 - and like he's just crushing it with the
00:20 - react js builds
00:22 - you guys saw nas jump on the cp team and

00:39 - people get jobs as developers so
00:41 - whatever we need to do within our power
00:44 - to make that happen we want to do and

00:53 - who has that sort of creative eye for
00:55 - design
00:56 - so you if you've come to the channel

00:59 - we've got things
01:00 - like airbnb netflix we've done
01:03 - um amazon clone we've done so many

01:21 - and to push themselves
01:22 - to create these builds um in on quite a
01:25 - high
01:26 - frequency and these exact projects are
01:29 - landing people jobs like left and right
01:32 - and helping people become developers and
01:34 - now we actually even have this like
01:35 - counter
01:36 - that's going uh if you can see that like
01:38 - little 31 right
01:40 - where it says lucifer the movie so right
01:43 - about here you'll see that little 31.
01:45 - um every single person is getting a job
01:48 - as a developer we're counting it and
01:49 - we're kind of starting to count now we
01:51 - didn't start counting from the start of
01:52 - the year if that would have been already
01:53 - at like thousands
01:55 - and so a lot of students are getting
01:57 - jobs from stuff like this so now in this
02:00 - video we're also going to lay out
02:01 - specifically
02:03 - what we're looking for from you because
02:06 - it's a
02:06 - huge opportunity for you because if you
02:10 - become a developer
02:11 - you get to also build your own personal
02:13 - brand and you get to
02:15 - produce content make an impact on so
02:17 - many people's lives and be
02:19 - paid also really well but for that you
02:21 - also need to be
02:22 - pretty damn good and be willing to put
02:25 - in a lot of work and work your
02:27 - face and not be scared of that so that's
02:28 - just up front
02:30 - yep and i can vouch for this guys it is
02:32 - game changing like it's life changing
02:34 - when you get into this opportunity so
02:36 - show us that you can do this show us
02:38 - that you're willing to work hard
02:39 - and listen to the next steps as to how
02:41 - you can apply for
02:42 - this position yep so all right so
02:46 - basically
02:47 - let's do this so i'm gonna open this up
02:50 - and
02:51 - hopefully you can see a whiteboard right
02:54 - yep
02:55 - all right so let's type in
03:00 - javascript slash react.js position
03:05 - go
03:08 - and it this is you are a developer who's
03:11 - producing full-time content so keep in
03:13 - mind you're not working with us to make
03:15 - apps for us we only care about helping
03:18 - other developers and people who want to
03:20 - become developers get jobs if you're not
03:22 - obsessed with that mission
03:23 - do not apply with us we're not looking
03:25 - for developers to
03:27 - create like you know apps for us
03:30 - exactly and also that means being
03:32 - comfortable in front of the camera and
03:33 - guys it's always a nerve-wracking thing
03:35 - but we're looking for somebody who is
03:37 - willing to put themselves
03:39 - in those uncomfortable situations so
03:41 - that they can learn so they can get
03:42 - comfortable
03:43 - so they can absolutely crush it on these
03:44 - lives exactly
03:47 - um you should be passionate like
03:50 - about teaching people yep
03:54 - um and what other things are important
03:57 - so
03:57 - i would say like i think you should have
03:59 - some sort of experience in coding right
04:01 - like you should be
04:02 - either like what maybe we're looking for
04:06 - like
04:07 - practical experience we don't want to
04:08 - see a resume or a list of stuff like we
04:10 - just don't care about that
04:11 - once a practical experience so we're
04:14 - going to give you guys a medium
04:16 - for reaching out to us and you're going
04:17 - to be able to submit your
04:19 - apps so the deployed links to us yeah
04:21 - and we want to see the deployed app
04:23 - and then a github repo url so that way
04:26 - the deployed app we can actually see
04:27 - what the app looks like
04:28 - what you're capable of and then we want
04:30 - to be able to dive into your code and
04:32 - see
04:33 - how you write your code is it good is it
04:35 - functional
04:36 - um could it be improved what is it like
04:38 - does it go or does it stick to the
04:40 - standards and so forth
04:42 - so that is how we're going to go ahead
04:43 - and check your sort of
04:46 - skill level on that terms yup and we're
04:48 - going to have it
04:49 - basically linked below so you can go and
04:51 - then like apply
04:53 - now one of the things that i want to say
04:56 - is to stand
04:57 - above everybody else because guys keep
04:59 - in mind
05:00 - this is a channel made for developers by
05:03 - developers
05:04 - and we don't have a shortage of
05:07 - developers
05:08 - we're looking for like people who are
05:11 - really good at communication so
05:16 - uh that definitely means like you have
05:18 - to be a native
05:19 - mostly a native english speaker if
05:21 - you're not
05:22 - we also um then we just have to make
05:25 - sure that
05:26 - you're still a clear communicator so
05:28 - that is going to be important
05:29 - yeah and we have people on the team who
05:31 - are amazing developers
05:33 - where english wasn't their first
05:34 - language so it gets put off by it right
05:37 - david rokosi go watch his videos
05:39 - his recent videos right he's not a
05:40 - native english speaker
05:42 - but like he's making amazing projects
05:44 - and he's just doing these mern stack
05:46 - bills in the last one or two weeks
05:48 - and people are loving it absolutely
05:51 - crushing it
05:52 - and he just showed a willingness to
05:54 - learn and then he ran with it
05:56 - and we took that as an opportunity we
05:57 - see that in somebody
05:59 - and we go with it so you need to show us
06:01 - that you're actually willing to learn
06:02 - willing to play in
06:04 - that hard work and graft if you're
06:05 - coming in as an expert this is not the
06:08 - place for you to apply
06:10 - we want you to come in with a beginner's
06:12 - mind no matter how good you are
06:14 - because we want to do what's best for
06:16 - the people and if that
06:18 - and that requires us to be really
06:19 - flexible in our ways if you're not
06:21 - flexible in your ways again this is not
06:22 - a good
06:23 - position for you to apply for yeah and
06:25 - just to keep a sort of baseline
06:27 - me and kazi don't consider ourselves as
06:29 - experts
06:32 - yup exactly that's kind of crazy so
06:35 - we're definitely not looking for experts
06:38 - if you are that's great
06:40 - uh but we emphasize more on your ability
06:43 - to communicate your
06:44 - passion for teaching and helping other
06:46 - people that's much more important
06:48 - it's much more of that mindset that
06:50 - we're looking for 100
06:51 - um now another thing is
06:56 - in the air table below what's going to
06:58 - make you really stand out from everybody
07:00 - else
07:00 - is you having a video of you showing how
07:04 - you're creating the project like you're
07:06 - literally creating the project so for
07:08 - example
07:08 - you've seen a ton of our videos
07:11 - on youtube with sunny and me
07:14 - creating projects live or
07:18 - even if it's not live you see like we're
07:20 - doing a screencast and then
07:22 - our screen is at the bottom and we're
07:23 - talking and recording and explaining the
07:25 - code
07:26 - if you want to stand above almost
07:28 - everybody else
07:30 - because almost nobody will do this and
07:33 - then by default only the few people that
07:35 - actually do this step
07:36 - are very likely to then get the job of
07:38 - working with us
07:40 - is submit a video of you coding up
07:43 - a app whether it's with react or
07:45 - javascript
07:46 - like build the app
07:49 - you know whether it's like a 30 minute
07:51 - video or an hour long video
07:53 - and explain it as you build it
07:56 - exactly give us show us how you break
07:59 - down and it would be
08:00 - amazing to see you approach a problem
08:03 - see how you break it down and then
08:05 - actually code up the solution for it
08:07 - because it will show us
08:08 - how your teaching skills are how you go
08:10 - about breaking down a problem and then
08:12 - your actual coding abilities
08:13 - yep that's going to be really important
08:15 - because that's going to make
08:17 - because we're going to get so many
08:18 - freaking submissions it's going to be
08:19 - crazy so
08:20 - as soon as we see somebody has a video
08:22 - that's all we're going to look at that's
08:24 - all what i'm going to look at honestly
08:25 - i'm just gonna be clicking on like
08:26 - people's videos and if your video is
08:28 - good of you explaining
08:30 - a full project then that's a really
08:32 - really good sign and go all
08:34 - out on that video because really like
08:36 - for most people this is an opportunity
08:38 - of a lifetime like you're gonna be
08:40 - working for
08:41 - probably the best team and the most
08:43 - passionate team of developers and you're
08:45 - gonna
08:45 - learn like crazy as well like david was
08:49 - working with sunny just for a little bit
08:51 - and he picked up
08:52 - so much react it was insane he picked up
08:54 - i was talking to him he's like dude i
08:55 - picked up cloud functions
08:57 - i picked up like how to have stripe work
08:59 - how to have the back end work
09:00 - i picked up firebase and react like
09:02 - literally in like three days
09:04 - exactly yeah it is true guys like we all
09:08 - work together in this team and
09:09 - one thing i want to stress about what
09:10 - kazi said earlier is we are not
09:13 - starved for developers right now right
09:14 - there's a huge
09:16 - influx of people who want to work with
09:18 - this team because this team is like
09:20 - insane i made like one story post and we
09:22 - had like
09:23 - 20 developers or 15 developers like
09:25 - submitting everything they had
09:28 - yeah so if you want to be a part then
09:30 - make sure it's not just a normal
09:31 - submission
09:32 - you go above and beyond to show us how
09:34 - badly you want this
09:36 - and that is going to show through your
09:37 - submission yeah
09:39 - and once you're on the team like we're
09:40 - going to go at bat for you but to us
09:43 - the culture is above everything else
09:45 - because we can train you and we can
09:46 - teach you the skills
09:47 - but the culture is really like the most
09:49 - important thing that we can't teach you
09:51 - having a beginner's mindset being
09:52 - ambitious being hungry like you prove
09:54 - that
09:55 - by your work ethic your perseverance
09:57 - like you following the protocol and
09:59 - submitting and applying to air table
10:01 - like if we
10:03 - see your thing and you don't have a
10:04 - video in there like then don't be
10:06 - surprised if we don't consider you
10:09 - like have a video of explaining that's
10:11 - like one of the most important things
10:13 - i'm gonna say because it's a position
10:14 - where we're looking for a content
10:16 - your full-time content producer you're
10:18 - creating content
10:19 - for eight to ten hours a day that's like
10:22 - what the expectation
10:23 - is and you're creating content for the
10:25 - people and you're trying to help them
10:27 - out so just make sure that
10:29 - that's something you're passionate about
10:31 - you're also like in
10:33 - interested in improving your own coding
10:35 - skills but
10:36 - make sure you submit a video look at one
10:38 - of our recent videos you don't have to
10:40 - do a three or four hour build
10:41 - but you could do 30 minute to one hour
10:44 - and try to model it as closely as you
10:46 - can
10:47 - and you can use uh things like i think
10:50 - you can download
10:52 - ecam or screenflow and you can try to
10:55 - record a video with screenflow or
10:58 - loom as well um the only reason i
11:02 - am like a little weird iffy about loom
11:03 - is sometimes it crashes but
11:05 - if you don't want to pay for screenflow
11:07 - and you don't want to figure out how to
11:08 - use ecam
11:09 - then maybe just use loom yeah exactly
11:13 - and guys we really do recommend that you
11:15 - enter you include that video and you
11:17 - put all your effort into that show us
11:19 - what you're capable of show us your
11:21 - builds
11:21 - like we said drop the deployed app url
11:24 - so that we can actually go and play with
11:26 - the builds
11:26 - test it out for ourselves drop that link
11:29 - to the github url that'll show us that
11:31 - also assures that you know how to use
11:33 - github you know how to actually go ahead
11:34 - and use things like that
11:35 - so really really important stuff and the
11:38 - number one sort of thing i want to
11:39 - mention here guys is
11:40 - show us your energy right so all of this
11:43 - stuff
11:43 - you could be the best teacher in the
11:45 - world but we
11:47 - thrive off that energy that we are able
11:50 - to deliver
11:51 - to everyone learning from us and that is
11:53 - what we're looking for that same golden
11:55 - energy
11:56 - that one of you guys will be able to
11:57 - have join and bring into the team
11:59 - yep and the truth is this is a very high
12:03 - pressure
12:04 - fast paced environment that you're going
12:06 - to be in so like that's also
12:08 - i think important for transparency for
12:10 - everybody so like
12:11 - when sunny and me and nas are working
12:13 - and we're like hey you're gonna be going
12:15 - live or let's go live this week
12:17 - and sunny has to bust out three bills
12:21 - three to four hour bills a day
12:24 - right that's crazy it's like 12 hours of
12:27 - coding
12:27 - and massive bills that requires you to
12:31 - be able to withstand high pressure i
12:32 - mean you have
12:33 - 500 people watching your thousand people
12:36 - watching you 30 000 people watching your
12:38 - video in one day or a hundred thousand
12:39 - people watching your video in like two
12:40 - days
12:42 - exactly and you just have to rise up to
12:44 - the occasion and show us that
12:45 - are you willing to do that or can you
12:47 - take on that sort of pressure
12:49 - because it is an important part of the
12:50 - role yup but then you know
12:53 - on the flip side think about the skills
12:56 - and how you're improving then when you
12:57 - go to a job interview you're
12:59 - laughing
12:59 - at the interview because you're like hey
13:01 - i can handle
13:03 - debugging in front of 2 000 people live
13:07 - i think i'll be fine during this one
13:09 - person who's like watching me debug like
13:11 - you will become
13:12 - that good yeah and it's so true what
13:15 - kazi said like once you get into that
13:16 - position
13:17 - job interviews become a breeze like
13:20 - really really do become a breeze
13:22 - um also i think other things that are
13:24 - important just like
13:26 - uh don't have sense of entitlement we
13:28 - don't like to work with people who have
13:30 - entitlement
13:31 - if you if that's you this is not the
13:33 - right place like we're really looking
13:35 - for people who have a lot of humility so
13:37 - i do want to say that
13:39 - a lot of humility groundedness
13:42 - um way humble yeah we're not none of us
13:46 - are trying to prove anything to each
13:47 - other like if sonny has a good idea
13:49 - then i will just tell sonny yo your idea
13:51 - is better than mine we'll just go with
13:52 - your thing
13:53 - we don't allow our ego to get in the way
13:56 - of doing what's best for
13:57 - people for them to get jobs that's
14:00 - always the goal
14:01 - yep right so
14:04 - staying humble is important having the
14:06 - humility groundedness beginners mindset
14:09 - um all these things are very very
14:11 - important and just remember like if
14:13 - you're gonna be
14:13 - working here it's kind of like if you
14:16 - were working out with somebody who was
14:17 - like really jacked when you work out
14:19 - with them it's like
14:20 - one of the hardest workouts of your life
14:23 - um
14:23 - we are extremely hard working team this
14:26 - is why in three to four years we're the
14:28 - fastest growing coding channel in the
14:29 - world
14:30 - and give us a little bit more time and
14:33 - we're gonna
14:34 - be like the best growing best coding
14:36 - channel in the world
14:39 - and for that we need to work
14:42 - really really hard so often times you
14:44 - know we're working like five to six days
14:45 - a week
14:46 - for 10 to 12 hours a day you can choose
14:49 - somewhat within your own hours but like
14:51 - those things are important to know as
14:53 - well yeah one thing i'll mention as well
14:56 - is being
14:56 - adaptive in your timing so right now
14:59 - cars is in la i'm in london
15:01 - but we make it work with the time
15:03 - schedules and that is a huge
15:04 - hour gap so it's an eight hour
15:06 - difference there but we always find time
15:08 - to work together to make calls
15:10 - everything so you have to be able to be
15:12 - adaptive
15:13 - around your time zone yep and a lot of
15:15 - the team is
15:16 - in california so it's like a lot of the
15:19 - team is operating in pst
15:22 - and you know it's like 7 00 a.m to 5 00
15:24 - a.m pacific
15:26 - right so um this is
15:30 - in between this time is a really perfect
15:32 - time because then you're
15:34 - um with this with the team but if this
15:36 - is like really really
15:37 - impossible for i mean preferably we want
15:40 - somebody who's
15:41 - operating at that time because if you're
15:42 - going to be a core member of the team
15:43 - like you have to be okay
15:45 - and be willing to be able to work with
15:47 - the rest of the team like me
15:49 - nah sunny aaron frankie all of us
15:52 - yeah exactly um
15:56 - can you think of other things or can
15:58 - sunny if you can think of other things
16:00 - but like we definitely we just want to
16:01 - make it
16:03 - we're recording i mean this is like
16:05 - actual like people are listening to this
16:06 - okay
16:10 - teaching people
16:14 - can you think of anything else sonny um
16:18 - so even if you have skills like so
16:21 - graphql
16:22 - any new technologies up and coming
16:24 - anything like that you can bring to the
16:26 - table
16:27 - for example qazi when i reached out to
16:29 - him i introduced react
16:31 - right and then we pretty much took react
16:33 - we ran with it so if you
16:34 - come
16:41 - a huge one is server side rendering for
16:43 - example if you're
16:44 - if you're a server-side rendering guru
16:46 - and you can show that
16:47 - then bring that across because that will
16:49 - be something hugely valuable
