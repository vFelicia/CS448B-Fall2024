00:07 - what's up
00:08 - this is quasi from clever programmer
00:11 - college degree
00:13 - versus a coding bootcamp versus being
00:16 - self-taught
00:18 - which one is right for you in this video
00:21 - that's what we're gonna talk about but
00:22 - before we start
00:24 - please do me a favor smash that like
00:26 - button do that right now
00:28 - subscribe to the goddamn channel if you
00:30 - haven't already and let's get
00:32 - right into the video what's up guys this
00:35 - is qazi from cleverprogrammer
00:37 - and what i want to talk about today with
00:38 - you is what is the right path for you
00:41 - because you have so many choices
00:44 - that i couldn't even list them all out
00:46 - you have coding bootcamps you have a
00:48 - college degree
00:50 - you have the route of being a
00:51 - self-taught developer
00:53 - and not to mention you have unlimited
00:55 - youtube resources
00:56 - you have coursera edx same treehouse the
00:59 - list goes
01:00 - on right and there's so much that's out
01:03 - there
01:04 - but everybody has a specific situation
01:07 - a specific need and so let's address
01:10 - those
01:11 - and go down the list okay so first up
01:14 - let's start off with
01:16 - let's start off with let's take being a
01:18 - self-taught developer
01:20 - let's start there okay boom self-taught
01:24 - developer
01:24 - that was you know i would i would say
01:26 - that i was mostly a self-taught
01:28 - developer myself that's a path that's
01:30 - really close to my heart
01:31 - that's the path that i took now for me
01:34 - to get up to speed it did take a long
01:37 - time for me to like
01:38 - really become well versed in programming
01:42 - but a lot of it i picked up on my own
01:44 - how did i pick up most of these skills
01:45 - i took tutorials online from youtube
01:48 - i watched videos and blog posts online
01:51 - i went to coursera i went to
01:55 - udacity edx and many other platforms
01:59 - i remember doing the cs50 course that
02:02 - was
02:03 - freaking hard but also a lot of fun
02:06 - and i also remember i went to through
02:09 - this book
02:10 - called a little schemer okay fantastic
02:13 - book by the way if you want to improve
02:14 - your problem solving skills
02:16 - get this [ __ ] book it is so good it's
02:18 - called little schemers
02:20 - and it changes the game for you when it
02:22 - comes to learning recursion because
02:24 - recursion is such a difficult concept to
02:26 - understand and master
02:27 - and i would use this book to just keep
02:29 - going down the list of recursion keep
02:31 - doing practices
02:32 - i remember the kadur which is cdr
02:36 - and you it's a very primitive language
02:38 - right so there's not much you can do
02:40 - there's no like for loops you can't
02:41 - append stuff
02:42 - everything has to be done through
02:44 - recursion whether you're adding or
02:45 - subtracting
02:47 - whether you're dividing whatever it is
02:49 - you're doing
02:50 - like everything is done through
02:51 - recursion and
02:53 - it gets you so practiced in that concept
02:56 - and so good
02:56 - that then you can actually do things
02:58 - like whether you're trying to solve a
03:00 - maze
03:00 - you're trying to solve some type of
03:02 - recursive problem you get very good at
03:03 - thinking like that so
03:05 - fantastic book but you know kind of
03:07 - besides the point
03:08 - but yeah i mastered tons of things all
03:10 - by myself so that's the
03:12 - self-taught route i would spend 10 to 15
03:15 - hours a day coding all by myself the
03:18 - great things about self-taught is
03:20 - i'd have to spend a lot of money i got
03:22 - to just practice and kind of learn on my
03:24 - own
03:25 - another great thing about being
03:26 - self-taught is
03:28 - you know i do feel like i got a lot of
03:30 - confidence from it because
03:31 - i you know taught myself all of these
03:34 - skills i basically taught myself how to
03:37 - become a developer
03:39 - now the downside of being self-taught is
03:42 - this
03:43 - i could have gotten my job as a
03:46 - developer a lot faster
03:48 - my skills could have been way stronger
03:51 - because
03:52 - i remember when i started being able to
03:55 - afford real developers i would go on
03:57 - platforms like code mentor and pay them
03:58 - like 70
03:59 - an hour to train me they were
04:02 - [ __ ] good and they were just like
04:04 - [ __ ] slap me you know like
04:06 - no you're doing this wrong fix this fix
04:08 - this no you shouldn't do a commit of
04:10 - every single file all the time that's
04:12 - stupid commit
04:14 - one thing at a time okay so like i would
04:17 - always do
04:17 - git commit you know and like do dots
04:20 - like i would do commit all
04:23 - i'll be like never do that commit each
04:25 - file with like a specific message with
04:28 - that and i was like oh that's so smart
04:30 - and like
04:31 - little practical things or when i was
04:34 - learning python and django
04:35 - and the way one of my instructors her
04:37 - name was jessamine the way she would
04:39 - tell me
04:39 - i should name my models and every time i
04:42 - was actually adding
04:43 - when to actually migrate my data versus
04:46 - something else
04:47 - and i remember learning each of these
04:48 - lessons and they were so technical and
04:50 - so precise
04:51 - and i became so [ __ ] good and clean
04:54 - as a developer
04:55 - and i would test everything so
04:57 - rigorously
04:58 - and i was learning so many professional
05:01 - software developer skills from her
05:03 - had i been able to afford her earlier 1
05:05 - million percent
05:06 - that would be the way to go it's kind of
05:08 - like if you wanted to learn basketball
05:10 - michael jordan was your coach and was
05:12 - coming in to train you two
05:13 - four five eight hours a day
05:17 - you just become so so so damn good
05:20 - there's no [ __ ] way you could get
05:22 - that good all by yourself like it just
05:23 - doesn't make sense it's not gonna happen
05:25 - right you get that training and then you
05:27 - become so good it's like
05:28 - tyson just becoming good by himself in a
05:31 - room right
05:32 - he could have probably become good but
05:34 - not great and that's kind of what
05:36 - happened when he had a coach so
05:38 - that was one of the things i always
05:39 - wished i had and i didn't even when i
05:41 - was doing chess and i became pro at
05:43 - chess in my high school at niles north
05:46 - i became so good at chess but i always
05:48 - wish i had a really good great coach but
05:50 - i could just
05:50 - never afford one that was the biggest
05:52 - problem so
05:54 - self-taught that's those are my thoughts
05:56 - on self-taught i think it's a great way
05:57 - to go
05:58 - but i think if i could have invested
06:01 - that's what i
06:02 - would have personally done okay next up
06:04 - we have a college degree
06:06 - so here are my thoughts on the college
06:08 - degree
06:12 - i think college degree is [ __ ]
06:16 - trash when it comes to becoming a
06:19 - full-on developer
06:20 - okay and let me explain why
06:24 - it is so grounded in theory it is so
06:28 - deeply grounded in theory it just never
06:31 - plays out to
06:32 - actual practicality of becoming a
06:34 - developer now
06:36 - with all due respect it matters what
06:38 - you're doing now if you want to become a
06:39 - data scientist
06:40 - and you need to know all the computer
06:42 - science theory and you need to have all
06:44 - of that other stuff
06:46 - handled yeah maybe it makes sense if you
06:48 - really need a deeply theoretical
06:50 - background
06:51 - it might make sense outside of that
06:54 - investing
06:54 - four years and putting in sixty thousand
06:57 - dollars
06:58 - or forty to sixty thousand dollars in
07:00 - those years
07:02 - and having to go to a chemistry [ __ ]
07:04 - class how the [ __ ]
07:06 - is chemistry gonna help you with coding
07:09 - like help me explain that that never
07:11 - made sense to me they said it would make
07:12 - sense at some point but it never made
07:14 - sense
07:15 - how is public speaking and help help me
07:18 - how did uh investment class help me with
07:21 - coding
07:22 - how did my history class help me with
07:24 - coding
07:26 - to this day i never understood maybe one
07:28 - day when i become smart enough i'll
07:30 - [ __ ] understand but
07:31 - until that day it doesn't make sense to
07:33 - me and when things don't make sense to
07:35 - me i make a [ __ ] decision and i just
07:36 - stop
07:37 - that's why i just stopped going to
07:38 - college so
07:40 - you know there's there's a limit to it
07:42 - and another
07:44 - thing that i really dislike about
07:47 - college is that a lot of the material is
07:49 - outdated
07:50 - you're not going to be learning react.js
07:52 - in college
07:53 - you're going to be learning php
07:56 - and wordpress which was like popular 20
07:59 - years ago
08:00 - and now react gs is what's popular wait
08:03 - 20 years and then maybe they'll start
08:04 - teaching it
08:05 - so they're so far behind the actual
08:09 - practicality of what is going on in the
08:10 - job market
08:12 - versus what's going on in the
08:13 - professor's head who's been teaching
08:15 - there for 30 years and his only thing to
08:17 - worry about is whether he's gonna get
08:18 - tenure or not
08:22 - it doesn't make sense to me so for
08:24 - becoming a developer
08:27 - it doesn't make too much sense to me
08:28 - okay so between the college and
08:30 - self-taught
08:31 - i would recommend going self-taught and
08:33 - just like picking up these skills
08:35 - okay number three you have a coding
08:38 - bootcamp
08:39 - all right now let's talk about a coding
08:42 - bootcamp
08:42 - and the benefits of it and the cons of
08:46 - it okay
08:47 - so unlike a college degree a coding boot
08:51 - camp
08:51 - is between six to 12 months depends
08:54 - right some of them are three months like
08:55 - you have hack reactor and general
08:56 - assembly and
08:58 - whatever else is out there right leson
09:01 - lei wagon and a bunch of other ones
09:05 - right
09:05 - they are between three months to 12
09:08 - months
09:09 - some of them are full-time some of them
09:10 - are part-time
09:12 - most of them however require you to quit
09:15 - your job so you can focus on it
09:17 - and you know really change your career
09:19 - most of the
09:20 - coding bootcamp students are people who
09:22 - are looking to change their careers i
09:24 - think that's
09:25 - the first important thing to understand
09:27 - about who a coding bootcamp is generally
09:29 - for
09:30 - another thing about a coding bootcamp
09:33 - that i wanted to
09:34 - i wanted to go to coding boot camp way
09:36 - more than i ever wanted to go to a
09:37 - college
09:38 - because for me i want to learn in an
09:40 - extremely immersive way
09:42 - when i was learning jiu jitsu and
09:45 - lifting
09:46 - power lifting and kickboxing i did it
09:48 - for five to seven hours a day
09:50 - and i just became really good at it when
09:53 - i did chess i just did it for
09:55 - seven to ten hours a day four hours
09:57 - would be spent
09:58 - at the chess club every single day from
10:01 - 3 p.m to 7 or 8 p.m
10:03 - every single day except for saturdays
10:06 - um and maybe sundays so
10:09 - whenever i look at all the things i got
10:12 - good at whether it was
10:13 - ping pong or chess or bowling
10:16 - whatever it is right business
10:19 - it was a lot of time and
10:22 - immersion not i'm gonna do some
10:24 - chemistry and then i'm gonna do pe
10:27 - how the [ __ ] does that make sense to
10:29 - anybody like somebody please explain to
10:30 - me in chat maybe you're smarter than me
10:32 - and you can [ __ ] explain it because i
10:33 - was never able to explain it
10:35 - so
10:39 - what was i talking about coding so
10:41 - coding bootcamps right let's go back to
10:43 - just talking about coding bootcamp so
10:44 - immersion is the thing that i loved
10:47 - about the idea about coding bootcamps i
10:49 - remember i wanted to go to
10:51 - um i think one of them was hack react
10:53 - one of them was galvanize or something
10:55 - like that i really wanted to go to it
10:56 - because i just love the idea of
10:58 - immersion
10:59 - i love the idea of like learning just
11:01 - intensively
11:02 - in a couple of months time and i love
11:05 - the idea of
11:06 - you kind of come out and you're looking
11:08 - for a job or you're getting a job
11:10 - it is like this very defined goal
11:13 - so for me that was something i wanted to
11:15 - do but just like i couldn't get
11:17 - afford to get a chess coach i couldn't
11:19 - justify or afford
11:21 - uh you know spending 15 or 25 000
11:25 - at the time but if i was one of you
11:29 - who has the money who is currently going
11:32 - to a job
11:33 - and is looking to career switch one
11:36 - million [ __ ] percent without any
11:38 - hesitation in my mind
11:39 - coding boot camp is a really intelligent
11:41 - decision to make
11:43 - because you're making that career switch
11:45 - happen in three months six months 12
11:47 - months
11:47 - that's what you're looking at okay
11:50 - now with that said here a couple of
11:53 - things to keep in mind
11:54 - regardless of whichever track you're
11:55 - going okay so if you're going a very
11:58 - so just to recap so far if you want to
12:00 - go a very heavily theoretical track
12:02 - college might be really good for you if
12:05 - you want to just
12:07 - be extremely practical and you're
12:09 - looking to get a job
12:10 - and you're a student who has no income
12:12 - right now
12:13 - or low income and there isn't you don't
12:16 - have a parent that's going to invest in
12:18 - it or a family member that's going to
12:19 - invest in it
12:21 - then for you go and be self-taught
12:24 - okay look for resources network with
12:26 - people make friends learn from them
12:28 - it's going to take you a couple of years
12:30 - but you're very realistically going to
12:32 - get a job
12:32 - and not have a [ __ ] huge loan okay so
12:36 - get out of that loan and like just learn
12:39 - by yourself
12:40 - now if you're in the category three
12:42 - where if you have the money
12:43 - and you can actually that that's income
12:46 - that you can actually invest
12:48 - you just accelerate your process okay
12:50 - you're gonna go from like spending three
12:51 - years to like
12:52 - very realistically within six to twelve
12:54 - months have a possible career change
12:56 - okay so that's
12:59 - honestly what i would recommend and
13:01 - especially if you already have a job
13:03 - and you're looking to make a career
13:04 - switch i believe that's the fastest way
13:06 - now here's a couple of things i want to
13:07 - say
13:08 - to whichever camp you're in
13:12 - you have to work your f
13:16 - it's okay we're already in you have to
13:18 - work your [ __ ] ass off
13:20 - okay there's no getting around the
13:22 - actual work whether you spend fifteen
13:24 - thousand dollars in a code in boot camp
13:26 - or you spend sixty thousand dollars in a
13:28 - college degree
13:29 - or you spend so much time and effort
13:31 - being a self-taught developer
13:33 - guys please just drill this in your head
13:36 - you need to be spending like five to ten
13:38 - hours a day coding
13:39 - you need to be spending minimum of 20 to
13:41 - 40 hours a week coding
13:43 - minimum whichever direction you go
13:46 - because here's the thing
13:47 - unlike buying shoes or buying a cup of
13:51 - coffee
13:52 - you can't just buy skills
13:58 - that's something nobody ever teaches us
14:01 - we're so used to being consumers and
14:03 - just buying things
14:04 - buying things mice you're not gonna
14:05 - [ __ ] invest 20 to 40 hours a week
14:08 - 15 i don't care if you spend 300 000 on
14:11 - a coding bootcamp or a college degree
14:12 - nothing is going to happen
14:15 - i want so i want you to please get out
14:17 - of that mindset because that's
14:19 - very dangerous you can't buy
14:22 - skills write that [ __ ] down you cannot
14:25 - buy skills skills are earned
14:28 - and what happens at a college coding
14:30 - bootcamp self talk whatever
14:32 - you have mentors or people around you
14:34 - that are guiding you to learn those
14:36 - skills it is your job to acquire those
14:37 - skills so whichever way you go you're
14:39 - looking to spend 20 to 40 hours
14:41 - the only reason i recommend people
14:43 - invest
14:44 - is you're now exchanging money
14:48 - okay you're giving money to somebody
14:49 - who's already been think of it like a
14:51 - sherpa
14:52 - on a [ __ ] mountain okay if you want
14:55 - to go to what are some of those
14:56 - himalayan mountains mount everest okay
14:59 - if you're going to [ __ ] mount everest
15:00 - if you go alone by yourself you might
15:02 - actually die right
15:04 - so you pay the sherpa for his skill
15:06 - experience knowledge
15:07 - take you by the hand up there so you
15:09 - don't die and didn't know the path
15:12 - okay because the cost of error there is
15:14 - very very expensive
15:16 - let's take another example people are
15:18 - like hey why can't i just
15:21 - why can't i just do this self-taught
15:23 - like this sounds great like that sounds
15:25 - amazing to me
15:26 - well think about it like this okay it
15:28 - depends your current situation
15:31 - if you're a college student nobody's
15:33 - relying on you you don't have the income
15:36 - do it self-taught i think that's
15:37 - fantastic
15:39 - if you're somebody who's who has a
15:41 - family who has
15:42 - people depending on you if you really
15:44 - are ambitious and you want to do it in a
15:46 - shorter time
15:48 - there's a lot [ __ ] lying on the line
15:51 - now you have to do this quickly now you
15:54 - do need the support
15:55 - think of it like this okay this is the
15:56 - way i explain it
15:59 - imagine flying a plane would you rather
16:02 - have a textbook with you
16:04 - or you'd rather have a real pilot right
16:06 - there sitting in the cockpit
16:07 - training you that's the difference
16:12 - okay when you have things on the line
16:14 - and you have dreams on the line and you
16:16 - have
16:16 - you're very ambitious the time has a
16:18 - cost
16:19 - self-taught two three two three five
16:21 - years you'll get a job you'll pick up
16:23 - the skills
16:24 - and then at the job you'll learn at a
16:26 - coding bootcamp what you're doing is
16:28 - like hey i'm giving the money up front
16:30 - so i can get that same
16:31 - job experience that i would get from
16:33 - senior developers so they can just train
16:34 - me right here and then i come out
16:36 - getting a job so then i cut my time from
16:39 - three or five years into six months
16:41 - that's all that's happening okay so
16:43 - you're p
16:44 - you're exchanging monetary it's a
16:47 - monetary investment
16:48 - but you get time back everything always
16:50 - has a cost
16:51 - even a free thing has a cost the free
16:53 - things cost is time
16:55 - the thing where you pay money that has a
16:57 - monetary cost
16:58 - but now you just save time so you have
17:01 - to start thinking about what's important
17:02 - to you
17:03 - right when warren buffett probably
17:05 - doesn't go to get his own coffee even
17:06 - sometimes probably right
17:08 - he probably has somebody he pays
17:09 - somebody who gets some coffee now he's
17:10 - saving time
