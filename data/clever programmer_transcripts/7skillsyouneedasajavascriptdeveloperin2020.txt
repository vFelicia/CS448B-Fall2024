00:00 - today we're going to talk about the top
00:02 - skills you need as a javascript
00:04 - developer in order to get
00:06 - a job
00:08 - [Music]
00:11 - what is up my beautiful people this is
00:14 - qazi from clever programmer let's start
00:16 - off with one of the
00:17 - best and most important skills i think
00:19 - you could have as a javascript developer
00:21 - today based on 300 job listings from top
00:24 - tech companies in april 2019
00:26 - and also in 2020 this is gonna be true
00:29 - the
00:30 - number one skill those people are
00:32 - looking for
00:33 - is react js react is a javascript
00:37 - library so it's still
00:38 - javascript at the end of the day but
00:40 - react allows you to do
00:41 - really amazing things with javascript
00:43 - really really fast just think about like
00:45 - you take javascript you give it steroids
00:47 - you get react
00:48 - it's basically javascript with super
00:50 - powers why should you use reactor who
00:52 - else is using react
00:53 - react is being used by the top tech
00:55 - companies in the world
00:56 - some of those companies include tesla
00:58 - reddit whatsapp facebook
01:00 - instagram and paypal and so many other
01:03 - companies that are using react
01:05 - every single day that's what they're
01:06 - actually built on we have been live
01:08 - streaming every single day from the last
01:10 - few weeks and we've built clones like
01:12 - netflix clone we built with react and
01:14 - show you how to build it yourself the
01:16 - amazon clone we built it was reaction
01:18 - how to build it on your own a to-do list
01:20 - app a facebook messenger clone
01:21 - and we have essentially put together
01:23 - these tutorials and guides that you guys
01:25 - can go check out
01:26 - on our youtube channel at the end of the
01:28 - day people don't really care about your
01:30 - words that much what they want to look
01:31 - at is what is your skill level
01:34 - and how they judge you on that is based
01:36 - on what you've built
01:37 - the projects so as a developer just let
01:39 - the portfolio
01:40 - and your work speak for itself and
01:42 - that's why we build those tutorials for
01:43 - you so you can
01:44 - kind of take access it's free and you
01:46 - can learn it and then hopefully get a
01:48 - job if
01:48 - you want to be able to make an income
01:52 - as a javascript developer and master the
01:54 - skills and you want the perfect marriage
01:56 - between the two then i want you to check
01:57 - out our course profit with javascript
02:00 - this course is absolutely unbelievable
02:02 - we have spent so
02:03 - much time making the most value-packed
02:06 - course that we could
02:07 - for you we have live coaching calls in
02:09 - there every single week that level of
02:11 - practicality i think is very very
02:13 - important now with that said guys let's
02:14 - jump
02:15 - straight into the video react has
02:17 - something called a virtual dom which
02:19 - essentially means that it allows you to
02:20 - really change things on the dom
02:22 - really really really fast okay that's
02:24 - the most basic way to think about it if
02:26 - you're on instagram and you type in a
02:27 - comment
02:28 - it doesn't actually refresh the entire
02:30 - page what it's doing is it's only
02:32 - refreshing that comment that's why it's
02:33 - so
02:33 - fast if you guys go to a bunch of apps
02:36 - like instagram facebook you'll notice
02:37 - they don't actually refresh things
02:39 - happen in real time when you click stuff
02:40 - or when you post stuff the whole page
02:42 - doesn't refresh
02:43 - all of that is happening because of
02:45 - react react has reusable components
02:47 - this is another big thing about why you
02:49 - should actually learn and use react what
02:51 - does it mean to have reusable components
02:53 - well in react
02:54 - when you develop you're actually
02:56 - building things and breaking them into
02:57 - separate components of their own if you
02:59 - take a look at the amazon clone that we
03:01 - built
03:01 - all of those products that you guys see
03:03 - up on the screen right now every single
03:04 - product is actually its
03:06 - own component and then it's super easy
03:08 - because then you can just like write one
03:09 - line of code and
03:10 - keep reusing that component in a really
03:12 - nice elegant
03:13 - way another skill that's very useful for
03:16 - you guys to learn
03:17 - is of course nodejs now if you have
03:19 - taken any of our tutorials and you have
03:21 - watched any of our videos with sunny and
03:22 - i
03:23 - where we're teaching you amazon netflix
03:25 - clone bills messenger clone builds all
03:26 - of that you'll notice that for our
03:28 - backend
03:29 - we are actually not using node.js we are
03:31 - using firebase
03:32 - firebase allows us to be able to do
03:34 - everything even with that said a lot of
03:36 - companies are still using node.js
03:38 - and they are still paying for that so i
03:41 - think it's a valuable skill to learn so
03:42 - i think that's one of the skills you
03:44 - should have in your toolbox
03:45 - with that said i think that essentially
03:48 - covers it
03:49 - for react skill number three is git
03:52 - now git is essentially version control
03:55 - or how i think of it as kind of like a
03:56 - time machine
03:57 - if you make mistakes it allows you to
03:59 - rewind in your app that you're making
04:01 - and go
04:02 - back so for example if you're adding
04:03 - multiple different functionality you can
04:05 - think of it like in a video game where
04:06 - you have save and checkpoints
04:08 - [Music]
04:10 - you can load from really any checkpoint
04:12 - or any save that you made so let's say
04:14 - like
04:15 - you build a login functionality into
04:16 - your app you hit save then let's say you
04:18 - build in the functionality in your app
04:20 - to display products but then imagine
04:23 - for some reason your login functionality
04:25 - broke and then like your entire app
04:27 - broke and you're like what the hell just
04:28 - happened like everything was working
04:30 - fine and now
04:30 - one month into the project and
04:32 - everything is broke what git allows you
04:33 - to do essentially
04:34 - load and you can actually just load back
04:36 - to when you built the
04:37 - login functionality is working perfectly
04:39 - and just
04:40 - continue from there i think it's one
04:42 - really important skill there's almost
04:44 - nobody doing any kind of coding or real
04:47 - development or a job
04:49 - that doesn't really know get like i
04:50 - don't know a single person
04:52 - skill number four you need to learn to
04:54 - get a job as a javascript or a react
04:57 - developer redux so redux is something
04:59 - that's hard
05:00 - to kind of grasp and understand right
05:03 - away the one thing sunny and i
05:04 - explained when we helped you build the
05:06 - amazon clone if i hit add to basket or
05:09 - add to cart button at the card button
05:10 - like maybe changes to one or it changes
05:12 - to two
05:13 - redux can allow you to do that without
05:15 - necessarily even hitting refresh
05:17 - and it can actually manage the entire
05:18 - state without ever having to go to
05:20 - another page
05:21 - or doing any type of redirect and so
05:23 - that state management is a very
05:25 - important skill to learn as a javascript
05:27 - or a react developer but
05:28 - because redux is hard learn it in a
05:30 - two-step approach
05:32 - the first step is actually learn
05:33 - something called context
05:35 - api and then go and learn redux as step
05:39 - two again none of these skills are
05:41 - highly paid on their own you kind of
05:42 - have to know
05:43 - multiple things right if you want to be
05:44 - a chef you want to be good at cleaning
05:46 - you want to be good at like
05:47 - actually cooking you also want to know
05:49 - about spices you can't just be like oh
05:51 - the only thing i do is like put it on
05:53 - the stove like i'm
05:54 - really good at like microwaving but any
05:56 - type of ecommerce functionality you want
05:58 - to add as a react developer you're going
05:59 - to need to learn redux
06:01 - another skill that i want to kind of
06:02 - highlight here is you should learn
06:04 - typescript think about like react it
06:06 - allows you to write and react
06:08 - code but in a way where it is like more
06:11 - statically typed what that means
06:13 - is you're declaring your data types as
06:16 - you go along now it might sound
06:17 - annoying to want to do that but what's
06:19 - amazing about it is that
06:21 - your code becomes a lot more robust
06:24 - stable
06:25 - way easier to read and you will make
06:28 - much less errors on top of that it's a
06:31 - skill a lot of people are looking for in
06:33 - a developer
06:34 - and they're willing to pay a much higher
06:36 - amount to work with somebody who
06:37 - understands and knows typescript learn
06:40 - firebase
06:41 - firebase allows you to do everything aws
06:44 - allows you to do
06:44 - i've built tons of things with aws and
06:47 - i've built a bunch of things with
06:48 - firebase
06:49 - so much easier to go with firebase
06:51 - firebase is built by google anything you
06:53 - can do in aws
06:54 - it's 100 times thousand times easier to
06:57 - do it in firebase
06:58 - definitely don't start with aws you're
07:00 - gonna get into a nightmare with aws
07:02 - you have to like learn about how does
07:04 - redshift database work oh i also have to
07:06 - go to my security groups and like
07:07 - whitelist ip addresses
07:08 - oh what is ec2 what are lambda functions
07:12 - oh is my function located in oregon or
07:15 - ohio you have to actually know that oh
07:17 - like you're a developer you don't want
07:18 - to like
07:18 - start learning and becoming like an i.t
07:20 - person right that's kind of annoying so
07:23 - stay away from that unless you
07:24 - absolutely need to learn it if you learn
07:26 - it with firebase
07:27 - once you learn all the skills you can
07:28 - then apply to aws easy no problem
07:30 - it's just so amazing to be able to have
07:33 - a
07:33 - hybrid between a sql and a nosql
07:36 - database
07:37 - and it scales so well it is so
07:40 - lightning fast and you can build the
07:42 - two-way functionality of
07:44 - like full crud functionality within
07:46 - minutes and it allows you to be in your
07:48 - code if you're coding in react or
07:50 - javascript
07:51 - with just a few lines of code it gives
07:53 - you full functionality to be able to
07:55 - add things to your firebase delete
07:56 - things from your firebase without having
07:58 - to like
07:59 - write full-on crazy mvc style
08:01 - programming creating
08:02 - routes all this crazy stuff it allows
08:05 - you to do it so
08:06 - fast you don't even need a back-end like
08:08 - node.js or anything like that to be able
08:10 - to interface with your
08:11 - firebase app so i would say learn
08:13 - firebase i think it's
08:15 - a highly valuable skill and it's only
08:17 - going up as time goes on people are
08:19 - learning at extremely fast rate learn
08:22 - firebase
08:22 - this list is honestly no particular
08:25 - order all of these skills are extremely
08:27 - valuable but number seven
08:28 - is learn rest apis if you want to do any
08:32 - type of web development
08:33 - learn apis they're so powerful and
08:36 - almost every single application you're
08:38 - gonna try to build or use
08:40 - is going to require apis either that's
08:42 - going to require you to learn how to use
08:44 - api so you can pull data from it and do
08:46 - stuff with it or
08:47 - people want you to build apis for them
08:49 - so like hey take my json file and turn
08:51 - it into api so i can use it from
08:52 - anywhere or take my database turn it
08:54 - into an api so i can use it from cloud
08:56 - anywhere in the world there's tons of
08:58 - functionality and use cases for how you
09:00 - can use apis
09:01 - like one example i'll give you real
09:03 - world is like i wanted to know
09:05 - how much money are we making every day
09:07 - in our business so what we're doing
09:09 - is we're using a selenium scraper to go
09:12 - to this one website
09:13 - log in and this website by the way does
09:15 - not have an api so
09:16 - like i want to get a text message like
09:18 - hey we made 1500
09:19 - today or we made 3 dollars today on my
09:22 - phone as a business owner i want that
09:23 - now as a developer it's your job to be
09:25 - able to get me that information but it's
09:27 - tricky
09:28 - so the solution we came up with is let's
09:30 - use selenium to
09:32 - log into the website scrape the website
09:35 - and scrape
09:36 - yesterday's sales so let's say
09:37 - yesterday's sale says 2600
09:39 - scrape it now how do we send it as a
09:41 - text message here's what we do
09:42 - we launch it up in the cloud so we
09:45 - actually put it in a rest api we build
09:48 - an api for and we put it in the api
09:50 - and then on my end all i have to do is
09:52 - actually i got to just do a get request
09:54 - and pull it from the cloud and using
09:56 - twilio
09:57 - twilio's api send it to myself as a text
10:00 - message okay so there are a bunch of
10:02 - different things happening here we're
10:03 - using api to actually put it in the
10:05 - cloud
10:05 - and then we're using a get request so
10:08 - we're using the api
10:09 - and then we're using twilio's api to
10:11 - send it as a text message on my phone
10:12 - guys that cannot happen without apis
10:15 - good luck building something like twilio
10:17 - to send text messages
10:18 - good luck building something that
10:19 - actually like gets you that information
10:21 - so that's why when you use apis you're
10:23 - leveraging
10:24 - what already exists and you're building
10:26 - on top of it okay so
10:28 - learn apis they are a brilliant skill
10:30 - you can leverage the power
10:32 - of google search engine if you learn
10:33 - apis you can build a
10:35 - python like base detection software with
10:37 - like six lines of code
10:38 - because it's using apis and it's using
10:40 - something that already exists
10:41 - you can get the power of instagram you
10:44 - know like with few lines of code because
10:46 - you can use their apis so
10:47 - i think you should definitely have this
10:50 - in your toolbox
10:51 - as a software developer javascript
10:53 - developer or web developer
10:55 - so there you guys go the top seven
10:58 - skills
10:58 - you need to become javascript or a react
11:01 - developer
11:02 - and get a job and actually get your
11:05 - dream job
11:06 - if you practice and learn and through
11:08 - project based learning you could
11:09 - definitely learn these skills and master
11:11 - them which is why we've been trying to
11:12 - build all these tutorials for you guys
11:14 - and teach you
11:15 - through our like netflix clone amazon
11:17 - clone instagram clone
11:19 - our facebook messenger clone all of that
11:21 - to teach you all of these skills whether
11:22 - it's

11:30 - you can use them and then you can master
11:32 - them and
11:33 - you can then go ahead and make an income
