00:00 - sup guys how's it going this is Kazi
00:01 - here from clever programmer calm today's
00:03 - video I want to talk about the
00:04 - importance of front-end design for a
00:07 - JavaScript developer Python developer it
00:10 - doesn't matter but like really the
00:12 - importance of front-end design because
00:13 - front-end right the key component about
00:16 - it is that you're not looking for
00:19 - something that just looks pretty when it
00:21 - comes to front-end design you're looking
00:22 - for something that the user knows what
00:24 - to do and for them to take a specific
00:26 - type of action so when companies are
00:29 - looking for like Airbnb Spotify Google
00:31 - Netflix whatever company they're looking
00:33 - for something that gets a person to take
00:35 - action for example Netflix front-end
00:37 - design is designed to get you to click
00:40 - on a video and use your application if
00:42 - they didn't have front-end design you
00:43 - wouldn't be on Netflix right same thing
00:45 - with Spotify it makes the action taking
00:48 - cleaner so it's not just about a pretty
00:49 - design it's like what will convert
00:51 - apples front-end design and their
00:53 - website is designed to sell Apple's
00:55 - products so in today's video I want to
00:58 - talk about front-end design but also
00:59 - really what I really need and the team
01:01 - at clever program we need your help to
01:04 - pick a design that's gonna be really
01:06 - good and it's gonna get you to start
01:07 - exercising your front-end design
01:09 - abilities and skills even if you don't
01:12 - want to work on your front-end design
01:13 - skills I think it's important that you
01:15 - understand how like to build an eye for
01:18 - and pattern recognition so even if you
01:20 - worked with team of other developers
01:22 - you'll know what front-end looks good or
01:24 - even if you use bootstrap and
01:26 - materialized on all of this you'll still
01:28 - know what type of front-end design looks
01:30 - good so like you can just use people's
01:32 - copy pasted code but know what looks
01:34 - good and what works so now let's just
01:37 - jump into this and this is what I need
01:40 - your help ok so we have our product
01:43 - called profit with JavaScript ok so this
01:45 - is our our course which we're calling
01:47 - your crush of JavaScript but it's our
01:49 - course process with JavaScript right now
01:50 - what we need to do is we want to design
01:52 - a page for it that converts like people
01:56 - not only go oh this is pretty but it
01:58 - highlights the features apart they get
02:00 - it and then they're like ok I want to
02:01 - actually buy this course so we are
02:04 - currently trying to design a new sales
02:07 - page that people would want to you know
02:09 - come to and be like oh this is pretty
02:11 - nice and I want to join the course but
02:13 - this is
02:13 - your guys's feedback and help because um
02:16 - I went to this website where you can
02:19 - like basically put a bidding in a
02:21 - competition and people can design pages
02:24 - for you right like this and then we want
02:27 - to pick the winner out of them so
02:29 - there's like two days left in the
02:31 - competition
02:31 - so if we get feedback now and I know
02:33 - your guys's answers and what you guys
02:35 - think then I'll be able to make a
02:37 - decision on this and like the team at
02:39 - Claire programmer and we'll be able to
02:41 - like have a amazing page that people
02:43 - really like and you will develop your I
02:46 - for front-end skills at the same time so
02:50 - if you ever want to go vote this is
02:52 - going to be the link I'll put that in
02:54 - the description of the video and you'll
02:56 - get these like eight options and if you
02:58 - put this this would be great now before
03:01 - you go ahead and do that I just want to
03:02 - talk about the main elements that we're
03:04 - looking for here for our sales page okay
03:06 - so we're looking for like of course
03:08 - something that has this stuff here right
03:12 - which is really important like for
03:14 - example we have the headline here for
03:17 - the page we have the sub headline right
03:20 - over here which is super important like
03:22 - hey this will get you ill increase your
03:25 - coding skills you'll build real-world
03:27 - projects and of course you will also
03:31 - learn how to make a living which is like
03:33 - you learn how to make an income with
03:35 - JavaScript so this headline we felt like
03:37 - was important and should be seen we feel
03:41 - like this video is gonna do most of the
03:43 - job like this video is super important
03:44 - for people to watch that this should be
03:46 - front and center and then they enroll
03:48 - now button so this is our current design
03:50 - that we have for this page now there are
03:55 - a bunch of things that it says you get
03:57 - when you join the course like 15 modules
03:59 - 30 hours of video content it's Facebook
04:01 - and slack community and then live
04:02 - javascript coaching calls and then of
04:05 - course we got testimonials now for
04:08 - testimonials what we want to be able to
04:10 - do is we want something that people
04:12 - should be able to see instantly and kind
04:14 - of understand what's happening so it
04:18 - doesn't it you don't want something
04:20 - where there's just a video you want
04:22 - people to be able to like their their
04:24 - skimming most people just
04:26 - came through rain there should be like
04:27 - whoa a hundred and ten thousand dollars
04:29 - this guy made from this course or as a
04:32 - JavaScript developer like what and
04:33 - they're like I don't know it seems
04:35 - unreal or whatever but then they can
04:37 - watch the video to see for themselves
04:39 - and like come up with their own decision
04:41 - right so we're testimonials this is what
04:45 - we like about our current design and
04:47 - then later I'm gonna start showing you
04:48 - the designs other people submitted so
04:50 - then you have a framework for what's
04:52 - good what works what what adds in these
04:55 - conversion factors and makes people
04:57 - actually move through your application
04:59 - and then you can like help us actually
05:01 - vote and pick a winner so then we can
05:04 - have a winner in the next day or two so
05:09 - those are the good parts so I'll keep
05:12 - going so this is testimonials you know
05:13 - of course like here's another one like
05:15 - boom boom boom cool obvious very easy to
05:17 - see as you're scrolling through you can
05:19 - see it in a snapshot another thing I
05:22 - like about this is like here the module
05:23 - so it covers all the modules what really
05:26 - people like I know is they like hey
05:29 - you'll build a Twitter clone there like
05:31 - that they like that they're gonna build
05:33 - a Google Maps project so that's what's
05:35 - cool Chrome extension and yet something
05:39 - about freelancing right so cool
05:41 - let's go past it let's see so that's the
05:46 - current sales page we have that people
05:49 - really like and we've been getting a lot
05:51 - of students now here's a so now here's
05:56 - where I'm gonna show you some of the new
05:58 - designs we got now one thing I want to
05:59 - talk about is one of the there's some
06:01 - key features that we want to highlight
06:04 - so for example weekly live JavaScript
06:07 - coaching calls these are unlimited guys
06:10 - so it's like even a ten thousand dollar
06:12 - coding bootcamp doesn't give you
06:14 - unlimited weekly coaching so this the
06:17 - sales design should do something where
06:20 - this screams out more and what are some
06:26 - other key another key thing that we
06:27 - added is we added the ability for every
06:30 - single student to get personalized video
06:32 - feedback so we introduced this thing
06:33 - called JavaScript Success coaches I'll
06:35 - show you that in just a second so right
06:37 - over here you'll see JavaScript success
06:40 - coaches right and really what this is is
06:43 - I'll move my screen over here and
06:46 - there's something we introduced in our
06:48 - slide channel you can see we have a
06:49 - slack channel for profit with JavaScript
06:51 - tons of students and the engagement is
06:52 - crazy but this is one thing I introduced
06:55 - a few actually what is it two weeks ago
06:59 - one week ago one week ago and what we
07:02 - wanted to do was we wanted every single
07:05 - student to have an exceptional
07:07 - experience right so we want every single
07:08 - student in the program to have an
07:10 - exceptionally high success rate and a
07:12 - world-class experience so this is what
07:15 - we wanted to add to this program because
07:18 - what we find is a lot of courses I mean
07:20 - like even the courses I've had in the
07:21 - past I mean it's cool right it's like I
07:23 - teach you some stuff great but that's
07:26 - not enough I feel like what can we do to
07:28 - enhance the experience of you guys and
07:31 - the customers even more so we're like
07:34 - okay let's think about that so I said in
07:37 - order to do that we're on a mission to
07:38 - pair up every single student with their
07:40 - designated JavaScript success coaches
07:43 - okay so our goal is every single student
07:46 - should have one coach that works
07:48 - alongside them and helps them and things
07:50 - like that so I wrote here's what you
07:54 - here's what you having a JavaScript
07:56 - success coach will help you accomplish
07:58 - in this program right so every single
08:01 - student will get personalized video
08:03 - feedback on your homework and projects
08:05 - extra weekly Q&A calls and then
08:07 - accountability right so here's what that
08:09 - means in actual form so people went
08:12 - crazy the loved it we got 25 replies to
08:14 - this it was pretty awesome so guys so
08:17 - check this out here this is how we did
08:18 - it right I spoke with bunch of people in
08:20 - the community who were awesome train
08:22 - them to be JavaScript success coaches
08:24 - and then here's what we did so every
08:26 - single week we are giving students
08:28 - homework assignments right so on the
08:30 - left hand side these are the students
08:32 - this is all important for you to
08:33 - understand because then you'll
08:34 - understand that oh this is what this
08:36 - feature is and then you'll think about
08:38 - how can we highlight it so then if
08:39 - you're building your own application you
08:41 - have a really amazing feature you'll
08:43 - know how can I highlight this one
08:45 - amazing feature or benefit that we have
08:48 - so you can see the students names on the
08:51 - left hand side right they submit their
08:52 - homework they submit their
08:54 - screenshots of how to did their homework
08:56 - what the project was blah blah then they
08:59 - submit their code right so this is all
09:01 - of their code to submit the lessons they
09:03 - learned blah blah blah and then over
09:07 - here on the right hand side these are
09:10 - the JavaScript success coaches so
09:12 - feedback provided by and boom these are
09:15 - all the coaches that are providing the
09:17 - feedback right so for example if I go to
09:18 - April 19th you'll see like students are
09:21 - building these projects like somebody
09:22 - built a Cove in nineteen track or
09:24 - another person let's see here what else
09:27 - would we have another person built a
09:28 - wireframe for The Cove in nineteen
09:30 - tracker before they actually start
09:31 - coding it up we got tons and tons of
09:33 - submissions right so then on the right
09:37 - hand side what you'll see is we have
09:39 - JavaScript success coaches so like
09:41 - demeanor is providing a video feedback
09:45 - to an right David Rakosi is providing
09:49 - video feedback to demeanor he's
09:52 - providing video feedback to Kiska
09:54 - you know jen is providing video feedback
09:56 - to jolt on on their homework and here's
09:59 - what what it looks like so if I just
10:00 - clicked it these students are able to
10:03 - then go and look at their video feedback
10:12 - right so how cool is that like every
10:15 - single student if I click here right so
10:29 - every single student right is getting
10:31 - some type of personalized video feedback
10:34 - I mean this is just so incredible like I
10:36 - don't know what other course or people
10:38 - are doing that and then like look at
10:42 - this right he's going over it so like
10:47 - imagine somebody was going through your
10:48 - projects and actually giving you
10:50 - feedback on every single thing that was
10:52 - in there I mean that's huge its massive
10:54 - right so that but we implemented that
10:59 - and now we want to highlight this
11:01 - functionality so that we want it to be
11:04 - in our Wii
11:07 - this functionality to this feature to
11:10 - show up on her sales page so now let's
11:13 - go into like some of the pages that we
11:15 - have here so I have tons of them but I'm
11:16 - just gonna show you the ones you're
11:18 - supposed to see so now you gotta just go
11:20 - to this URL which is gonna be the
11:21 - description of this YouTube video so
11:23 - just click that link and then you'll
11:25 - come to a page like this and then you
11:27 - can actually help me choose and help us
11:29 - choose which one is the best because
11:31 - this is where we really need your help
11:33 - we got tons of amazing designs and now
11:35 - we want to basically narrow it down to
11:37 - which ones are the best so I'll go
11:40 - through some of these pages and I don't
11:44 - want to skew your thought process but I
11:48 - just want to give you guys something to
11:49 - think about so you have something to
11:51 - judge right so we're looking for a page
11:55 - that's not necessary to think about this
11:57 - right and give how I want you to vote on
11:59 - it don't vote on it based on which one
12:01 - is pretty vote on it like literally
12:04 - which one would actually make you buy
12:06 - this course assuming you would be
12:07 - interested in getting something with
12:09 - JavaScript right which one would you
12:10 - actually pay for and join not just one
12:14 - that actually looks pretty so think
12:19 - about it like confirm a conversion
12:21 - perspective like hey if I got on here
12:23 - and you know this is what would make me
12:25 - join it or this is the thing that I like
12:27 - about the design that looks great so if
12:30 - you leave your comment I'm reading every
12:33 - single person's comment so I will read
12:35 - your comment I will either I will
12:37 - definitely see it for sure and it would
12:40 - really really help because we again and
12:43 - you know we paid sixteen seventeen
12:45 - hundred dollars or this or something and
12:47 - it's the competition is about to end in
12:49 - two days so it's not cheap and we want
12:51 - something that is amazing that really
12:53 - like screams what this course is about
12:56 - you know and like what this course can
12:58 - offer here's a new page that I designed
13:00 - if you go to best JavaScript course
13:03 - dot-com and just hit enter this is a new
13:07 - page that I designed so I'll just tell
13:09 - you my motivation behind this one one
13:12 - thing that I like about this is not that
13:16 - I mean of course that's there I added a
13:19 - timer so it creates like a sense
13:21 - like some urgency I like the list of
13:25 - companies that are using javascript
13:27 - right underneath the video so that looks
13:29 - like whoa you know if you land on this
13:31 - you're like man you know I trust this
13:34 - page it has like a list of companies
13:36 - that I recognize right that's what a lot
13:38 - of companies do it's called borrowed
13:39 - Authority when you see that you go oh
13:42 - man this is real because it has all
13:44 - these logos right so I feel like what I
13:47 - like about this and it has a list of
13:49 - logos and these big companies use it and
13:53 - I mean we have developers that are
13:55 - teaching this course that are literally
13:57 - working at there's one developer we have
13:59 - is working on a rocket ship called new
14:02 - Glenn and Blue Origin and you works for
14:05 - Jeff Bezos company so that's really
14:07 - really cool right so we have developers
14:09 - who are working at companies like these
14:10 - and then as soon as you come down what I
14:14 - like about it is that it has a
14:15 - testimonial and then you know this
14:18 - person saying here this course is worth
14:19 - and more than a 10k coding boot camp and
14:21 - then it this one highlights the features
14:25 - you know it doesn't look good because I
14:27 - designed it but it gets the job cross
14:32 - right the slack community Facebook
14:34 - community and then bunch of testimonials
14:36 - so if you hover over them you can just
14:38 - like click and play starts playing right
14:41 - boom so and then you enroll now so
14:45 - that's what I like about this one this
14:47 - one is mine so keep those things in mind
14:50 - when you go and vote you know whichever
14:52 - one you're gonna vote for it doesn't
14:54 - matter out of all of these keep that in
14:57 - mind like which one catches your
14:58 - attention which one would actually move
15:00 - you forward in the process which one
15:01 - would make you trust it which one would
15:03 - make you actually buy it not just think
15:05 - it's pretty and just give us thoughtful
15:08 - feedback all the feedback is really
15:10 - really helpful is not just like this one
15:12 - line feedback or even like paragraph
15:14 - long we're just saying random words
15:16 - what's really helpful is like critically
15:19 - thinking about it and intellectually
15:21 - answering this again selfishly what's
15:23 - really powerful for yourself and that is
15:25 - you'll get to develop patterns develop
15:28 - patterns of what front-end design works
15:30 - what front-end design converts what
15:33 - front-end designs may
15:34 - users do the thing you want them to do
15:37 - so then again when you're designing your
15:39 - app people will actually use it
15:41 - right not like throw it to the side so
15:44 - please give like thoughtful feedback
15:48 - right over here right for all of these
15:49 - please like give it a rating write
15:52 - whichever whatever rating you think I am
15:55 - reading this specially in today tomorrow
15:57 - the day after that's all I'm gonna be
15:59 - doing I'm going back and forth with all
16:01 - of the designers and then integrating
16:03 - your guys's feedback into this so it
16:05 - really means the world if you guys you
