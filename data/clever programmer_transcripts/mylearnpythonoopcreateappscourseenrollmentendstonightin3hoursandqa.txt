06:22 - you thank you really nice really cool uh
06:27 - Patrick hi host sir Matt
06:29 - luk I signed up tonight yeah I think I
06:33 - remember your name I think you
06:35 - definitely did sign up tonight whenever
06:37 - you guys sign up it actually calls my
06:39 - phone so if you sign up it'll actually
06:41 - mess up my Facebook live stream which is
06:43 - hilarious but whatever it's
06:46 - cool yeah
06:50 - so this hat was actually given to me by
06:53 - my friend uh and his mom made it for me
06:56 - that was cool his mom has never not been
06:58 - here for like years she finally came to
07:01 - United States I thought that was pretty
07:05 - nice Devin shout out to Devin I remember
07:08 - adding you buddy nice welcome on
07:12 - board James it's definitely not you my
07:15 - friend uh YouTube is very finicky with
07:21 - its audio
07:23 - synchronization I I don't know how
07:25 - Google is such a big company but they
07:27 - haven't figured this out yet it's a
07:29 - little confusing to
07:35 - me okay so tonight in four hours as you
07:39 - can see on my
07:41 - YouTube I think right here I'm going to
07:44 - pretend like I'm looking at it right
07:46 - hold on right
07:48 - there okay my course is ending in four
07:52 - hours okay the registration for that
07:54 - closes so if you guys have any questions
07:57 - about it let me know uh I'd be happy to
08:00 - help and otherwise we're going to kind
08:02 - of chill here for a little bit of a
08:03 - longer time and if you guys just have
08:05 - any questions in general and if I can
08:07 - bring value to your life you know ask me
08:10 - the questions while you have me here so
08:12 - I can answer them for
08:14 - you Antonia says after sign up we should
08:18 - pay
08:18 - $99 well you can't sign up unless you
08:21 - pay $99
08:24 - buddy I love you too Yemen Yemen yav
08:29 - lft WFT what do you mean by course
08:32 - registration what I mean is like should
08:34 - I just say
08:37 - my yeah I
08:40 - mean nobody can enroll in my course okay
08:43 - so I guess my course enrollment ends
08:45 - tonight if that's any easier you know if
08:48 - that makes more sense sure so my python
08:51 - op course essentially takes you from a
08:53 - complete beginner
08:57 - to a coding ninja from a beginner to
09:02 - being able to build apps step by step in
09:04 - less than 7
09:06 - Days and 7 days and is an exaggeration
09:09 - because one of the students his name is
09:10 - David he actually built his apps in two
09:14 - hours so it's kind of cool but yeah it's
09:17 - really like a step-by-step system that
09:19 - takes you there um also you master
09:22 - object-oriented programming why is that
09:24 - important well all of the graphical user
09:27 - interface that you see around you for
09:29 - for example where you are commenting
09:31 - that's a graphical user interface where
09:35 - hi jenica Doma nice to have
09:38 - you that's awesome Bonnie says I want
09:41 - some good python valuable projects to
09:43 - add in my resume Bonnie got to work hard
09:45 - for that takes time takes time takes
09:49 - time and consistent effort systematic
09:51 - methodical approach you'll get there my
09:53 - friend don't
09:54 - worry so yeah anyways I was talking
09:57 - about graphical user interfaces right
09:59 - you comment using them you look at
10:02 - pictures using them you interact with
10:04 - the websites using them you use apps
10:06 - using them right without a graphical
10:08 - user interface you'd be back in
10:10 - 1970s with the Dos command line but that
10:13 - changed cuz we got something called guy
10:15 - which is graphical user interfaces I'm
10:17 - going to take this hat off at this point
10:19 - love this
10:26 - hat all right
10:28 - cool so graphical user interfaces right
10:31 - like it's EV everything around you is
10:34 - basically a graphical user interface so
10:35 - you master that in the course okay and
10:38 - you learn the fundamentals behind it so
10:40 - instead of like you really just I don't
10:43 - know like uh copying code you know on
10:46 - these tutorial websites where you'll
10:48 - just copy all this code and then when
10:52 - the time comes and you're looking at a
10:54 - blank screen your brain is also a blank
10:56 - and you're sitting there scratching
10:57 - yourself does that happen to you guys
10:58 - say yes or no if that happens where you
11:00 - look at a empty screen and you're trying
11:02 - to write code and your brain just kind
11:04 - of goes
11:09 - blank
11:12 - Bruce hello my friend Bruce
11:17 - welcome Bruce welcome welcome
11:26 - everybody how long is the O course
11:29 - great question right now it's about um
11:33 - you know it'll be about even more than
11:36 - 10 plus hours of Premium video content
11:38 - and it's going to constantly getting be
11:41 - getting new videos it's going to
11:42 - constantly be getting new upgrades
11:44 - future bonuses new live sessions um all
11:49 - of that stuff that's going to be added
11:50 - to it is going to be absolutely free of
11:52 - cost to you if you lock it in at the
11:55 - current price but if you miss the
11:57 - tonight's deadline which is in 4 hours
12:01 - on YouTube it's right over here if you
12:04 - miss that my friend you miss it then the
12:07 - next time the course comes it's going to
12:09 - be way more expensive and I'm going to
12:12 - give you a pretty good reason why so
12:14 - I've gone through courses on corsera and
12:16 - also I'm going to spit out these names
12:18 - of these awesome resources if you want
12:19 - to use these free resources write them
12:22 - down okay if you by the way if you have
12:23 - any other tabs open just close them okay
12:25 - just relax put on your headsets
12:29 - get some
12:31 - popcorn get a drink get some water sit
12:34 - in your pajamas and just you know just
12:36 - relax and
12:38 - watch cuz we're going to be in this for
12:40 - the long run uh I'm going to answer all
12:42 - of your questions okay do not worry I'm
12:45 - going to go through um everybody and
12:46 - answer but yeah so all of that content
12:49 - you lock it in at the current price and
12:50 - then you kind of you're able to get
12:53 - it all right so
12:56 - basically you know I've taken course on
12:58 - corser I've taken them on Udacity I've
13:01 - taken taken them on um udem I've taken
13:05 - courses on free code Camp Linda like
13:09 - everything you could imagine like 50
13:11 - different resources okay and then I've
13:13 - also been able to work as a software
13:15 - consultant for many different clients
13:17 - and I've also done lots of personal
13:19 - coaching so this course essentially
13:23 - takes the best out of all of those
13:24 - courses and also you know it has a spin
13:28 - of being able to work as an independent
13:30 - contractor in it which I think is kind
13:32 - of cool cuz my course really focuses
13:35 - also on you getting the return on your
13:37 - investment that you put in the
13:38 - course
13:40 - also for the price of this course there
13:44 - is no other course that has weekly
13:47 - check-ins with you on every Monday
13:49 - that's what I want to be able to do with
13:50 - you guys okay ah somebody just got the
13:53 - course so the Facebook stream went
13:55 - offline I'm going to have to hang up
13:57 - this call one second
14:03 - Facebook stream is back awesome so
14:06 - whenever somebody actually gets the
14:08 - course uh it gives me a call on my phone
14:10 - which is really cool thank you for
14:13 - blessing with Udacity Devan he says yes
14:15 - you're
14:18 - welcome Mario yeah so the course you
14:21 - guys can also get it for $33 per
14:24 - month like that's nothing $33 per month
14:29 - okay for three uh for three months sorry
14:30 - that's it for three Mon it's a
14:31 - three-month payment plan okay I offered
14:33 - that for you guys
14:35 - $33 what is $33 let me break this down
14:38 - to you you go you teach you get one
14:42 - student that you teach a private lesson
14:44 - to generally private lessons you can
14:46 - very easily even as a beginner charge
14:48 - between $50 to $75 an hour or more but
14:51 - let's say you're super hesitant you're
14:53 - not confident in your negotiation skills
14:56 - you're like maybe if I could please
14:58 - teach you blah blah blah right and you
14:59 - land just one student that you can teach
15:02 - which is super easy and I show you how
15:03 - to do that and I'll be showing you
15:05 - consistently throughout our live
15:06 - sessions and the emails I'll send you
15:08 - and all of that let's say you get one
15:11 - student for $20 an hour okay for two
15:15 - hours in a whole month working with that
15:18 - you've made your return on investment
15:21 - plus seven bucks for that
15:24 - month okay and generally when you book a
15:27 - student you know you you have them for a
15:30 - recurring like you know uh one session a
15:32 - week for example so you can be looking
15:34 - at 80 bucks per student if you're doing
15:36 - $20 an hour with one student so I mean
15:38 - even in just the first month with four
15:40 - hours of your time you're getting a
15:42 - return on your investment okay
15:45 - so that is kind of like a
15:48 - no-brainer okay another really cool
15:50 - thing is I'm doing something called
15:52 - Sprint which is something software
15:53 - developers do uh and it's a project
15:55 - management system so we're going to have
15:56 - a Sprint in this session and that's why
15:58 - why I'm uh inviting you guys to this
16:00 - course because I want your help to take
16:02 - it to the next level so it's going to be
16:04 - a 30 to 60-day Long Sprint and
16:06 - essentially how it's going to work
16:08 - is let's say you join right here okay
16:10 - and we have a 30-day Sprint what's going
16:13 - to happen is
16:14 - that every Monday I'm going to check in
16:16 - with you guys so whether it's with
16:18 - surveys or we personally get in touch
16:20 - with you or I personally get in touch
16:22 - with you I'm going to get your feedback
16:24 - and the course is going to be structured
16:26 - around that okay also then when we have
16:29 - our live sessions and our live meetings
16:31 - we'll add those new things in so let's
16:33 - say you guys are saying hey we don't
16:35 - want to do monthly live sessions we want
16:36 - to do like bi-weekly live sessions you
16:39 - got it we'll have that you guys will be
16:41 - like hey I think I want to see this in
16:43 - the course or I want to build this kind
16:44 - of app in your service on the Monday
16:46 - that I check in with you and hold you
16:48 - accountable to your goals you got it
16:50 - we're going to add that to the course so
16:52 - really this course we're going to be
16:54 - developing it together as
16:56 - well there's already a ton of of content
16:59 - in there that'll take you a long time to
17:00 - catch up on but there's going to be new
17:02 - stuff and we're going to be able to
17:03 - build that together right that's pretty
17:06 - exciting like I think that's pretty
17:08 - exciting and contrast that with a coding
17:12 - online boot camp like thanful thinkful
17:14 - charges you not even for that kind of
17:17 - service they charge you $500 a month you
17:20 - know how I know cuz I was in I I've
17:22 - enrolled in
17:24 - thankful
17:26 - uh and also here you get a community of
17:29 - other students so you collaborate with
17:31 - everybody else whether you want to do uh
17:33 - software Consulting work while
17:35 - collaborating with other students you
17:36 - want to do personal projects with them
17:37 - you want to build websites together you
17:39 - can do that right so you're part of that
17:41 - actually live
17:43 - Community
17:45 - um yeah so those other resources right
17:48 - like Udacity is great but it doesn't
17:50 - offer you that personal Community it
17:52 - doesn't offer you that accountability at
17:54 - least not for cheap at the very least
17:56 - it's $200 per month and it still doesn't
17:59 - have live sessions with you okay
18:02 - so this course is only 97 and it has a
18:06 - monthly payment plan as well for three
18:08 - months which you can spread out your
18:11 - payments and it has those sessions which
18:13 - Linda doesn't offer which Udacity
18:15 - doesn't offer which which udemy doesn't
18:18 - offer which code academy doesn't offer
18:20 - so uh it has things which are actually
18:23 - not offered by all these uh other places
18:25 - and you guys get them if you get it you
18:27 - lock get in at the current price and
18:29 - then any new content is yours okay let
18:32 - me take on some more
18:34 - questions
18:39 - um James says if we purchase the program
18:41 - without the slack private group can we
18:44 - add that on later uh
18:50 - James I mean that's not something that I
18:52 - want to be doing all the time because
18:54 - what I want to do is just have all the
18:56 - people in slack at once because when
18:58 - newer people join then the older people
19:00 - who are already there they're like who's
19:01 - this person like they got to you know
19:03 - you're just kind of new to the crew what
19:05 - I want to be able to do is just
19:07 - everybody's kind of like tight and honed
19:09 - in and working together so send me an
19:12 - email James um and if you can email me
19:16 - by tonight and join in tonight then yeah
19:19 - sure we'll add you into the slack group
19:21 - okay but I think after tonight I'm not
19:23 - sure if I'm going to be allowing people
19:25 - to join in separately to the slack group
19:27 - okay it's just I want people to be on
19:30 - the same page I want to you get you I
19:32 - want you to get to know your community
19:33 - around you interact with everybody
19:36 - inside right enjoy and have fun and
19:39 - build things together what will be the
19:41 - cost of the new course simar
19:44 - asks in um on Facebook the cost of the
19:49 - course is
19:51 - $97 AKA two private lessons at $50 an
19:57 - hour and you make your money back AKA
20:01 - one private uh lesson at even 20 bucks
20:03 - an hour and in 5 hours you get your
20:06 - money back okay so I love the idea of
20:09 - getting return on my investment for
20:11 - example I bought this crazy course right
20:14 - um it's called ztl uh you know it's
20:18 - called yeah zero to launch okay it's
20:20 - about business and it was a $4,000
20:22 - course so the whole time I'm like okay
20:25 - all of these skills I'm learning from it
20:27 - how can I use it to get a return on my
20:29 - investment because these things are an
20:31 - investment right you're taking that
20:32 - initiative to invest in yourself you're
20:34 - saying okay I'm going to take this step
20:37 - I'm going to take this decision to
20:38 - improve my knowledge to make a
20:40 - commitment and to actually move forward
20:42 - like for example when I would take a
20:44 - corsera course I could have taken it for
20:46 - free and then paid for the certification
20:49 - but anytime I took anything for free I
20:51 - never made the commitment and I did not
20:53 - stick with it sure there were a few
20:56 - courses which I took for free and stuck
20:57 - with them like uh I think Udacity enter
20:59 - the computer science and whatever but
21:02 - when I paid for a course for corser I
21:04 - was like holy crap like I've paid for it
21:06 - I better stick with it so it's just that
21:08 - one more boost that helped me stick
21:10 - through it okay for you guys it might be
21:12 - a different boost right maybe you you
21:14 - can do something else to hold yourself
21:16 - accountable or have your friends hold
21:18 - you accountable for taking actions but
21:21 - it's just important to make a decision
21:23 - and then take action right like just
21:26 - Dilly dallying and being lazy and taking
21:28 - time procrastinating is a dangerous
21:30 - place to be wi says should I still do
21:33 - intro to programming Udacity win
21:37 - 30034 if you are at my course in Learn
21:40 - Python oop sure you can supplement
21:42 - Udacity great if you want to do that
21:45 - supplement your knowledge you have extra
21:46 - time totally cool
21:49 - awesome all right take on more questions
21:53 - should I learn Java or python to be an
21:55 - app developer python I think it's the
21:58 - world's greatest language people will
22:00 - disagree but that's what I think and
22:02 - here's why I've said this multiple times
22:06 - but one onethird of Google was written
22:09 - in Python okay so like one of the major
22:12 - languages involved in Google is python
22:15 - Instagram with 450 million people in
22:18 - growing platform written in Python
22:20 - Pinterest written in Python okay I've
22:21 - mentioned this multiple times already
22:23 - YouTube is actually a lot of it is
22:25 - written in Python so python you can use
22:29 - at a very like basic level to make like
22:32 - cartoon games to working in NASA doing
22:35 - big data analytics handling pedabytes of
22:38 - data okay or doing machine learning
22:42 - algorithms at Amazon which recommend to
22:46 - you stuff that you couldn't even think
22:48 - about in your own head you're like how
22:50 - does Amazon know me so well or how does
22:52 - Netflix know me so well I didn't even
22:54 - think of this and they're suggesting
22:56 - this to me right so python general
22:59 - purpose language but a very strong
23:02 - language and what I love about it is you
23:03 - could be a 10-year-old or a 9-year-old
23:06 - and understand it it reads so smoothly
23:09 - and easily and then you could also um
23:14 - take it to the next level and work at
23:16 - you know NASA or somewhere very complex
23:19 - like one of my friends actually works at
23:21 - Google his name is Ben marks I'm uh
23:23 - probably going to do a live interview
23:25 - with him uh for you guys so we can
23:27 - record it talk so that that would be
23:29 - really cool but yeah I mean python it's
23:32 - an all-purpose
23:35 - language what qualifications does one
23:38 - need to become a freelance
23:40 - contractor you don't need qualifications
23:43 - I I I see people saying that a lot and
23:45 - especially now that I run my entire
23:47 - business I rarely hire people that have
23:50 - um like cred like I don't care about
23:53 - credentials yes credentials matter but
23:55 - what matters more is what you can
23:56 - actually do right
23:59 - if I'm hiring
24:01 - you I want to look at your
24:04 - um like I I want to see what kind of
24:07 - return on my investment you can bring me
24:09 - I don't care about how cool your
24:12 - algorithms are I care about what kind of
24:14 - applications have you built and if it's
24:16 - in line with what I want and I can see a
24:18 - return on my investment I want to hire
24:20 - you it's a no-brainer for me okay so
24:23 - that's one of the things I emphasize in
24:25 - my course is that we build real
24:29 - applications okay we just had another
24:31 - person join super
24:35 - cool um I might actually call out your
24:37 - guys's names so what I'm going to do is
24:41 - how do I do this I do I open up my Gmail
24:44 - or
24:46 - something
24:48 - yeah all right so I'll try to call out
24:51 - your name and if it's you um
24:55 - cool that's really cool actually
25:02 - here's what I'll do anybody who joins in
25:05 - this YouTube session just send a little
25:08 - comment to uh you know kiat Clover
25:12 - program.com or just say it in our slack
25:15 - Channel or wherever you can reach me you
25:17 - know just
25:19 - say uh once you get the course just say
25:22 - I I I was in your YouTube Stream So when
25:24 - I have that one-on-one Master call with
25:26 - you oh by the way I also give you a
25:27 - one-on-one Master
25:29 - call how cool is that Master call where
25:32 - we actually discuss your strategy for
25:34 - the next 3 months of what you're going
25:36 - to be doing so you spend 15 minutes with
25:39 - me and we figure out what we're what
25:41 - you're going to be doing for the next
25:42 - three
25:44 - months like that's powerful right that's
25:46 - value you get some crazy value if I
25:48 - could if you could figure out your plan
25:50 - for the next three months I mean that's
25:52 - awesome that's part of the
25:56 - course
25:58 - and if you join and you say something
26:00 - about you were in this YouTube
26:02 - stream uh you know I'll I'll probably
26:05 - throw in like extra 10 minutes for you
26:06 - guys okay so I want to give you guys a
26:09 - little bonus for being here for being
26:11 - the action takers that you are love
26:17 - it hey Sam I got Facebook Facebook is
26:21 - baby compared to the YouTube like we got
26:24 - 52 people on YouTube and we got five
26:26 - people on Facebook
26:28 - Sager
26:30 - hi all
26:35 - right Rahul says can we use debit card
26:38 - for payments
26:39 - Rahul yes you can just select the PayPal
26:43 - option if you select the other option
26:45 - which
26:46 - is um that other option is only for
26:49 - credit cards so there's a button when
26:51 - you go to the page says PayPal you can
26:53 - just pay with PayPal PayPal handles
26:55 - debit card credit card PayPal whatever
26:58 - else okay you can also go the
26:59 - three-month payment route whichever one
27:01 - you prefer but uh the one of the most
27:06 - exciting things about this course is
27:07 - like being able to get that slack
27:09 - Channel like I would have killed for a
27:12 - community like that because let me give
27:14 - you a little bit of background like what
27:15 - had what has helped me learn at
27:17 - literally 10 times the rate of other
27:20 - people around me where I was able to
27:21 - charge more like two to three times more
27:25 - than even my mentors who have been uh
27:28 - doing software consultant work for like
27:31 - 20 years okay one thing that has helped
27:34 - me is being able to connect with really
27:36 - smart people okay um my number one skill
27:39 - okay is being teachable I'm not like
27:42 - intelligent or whatever like I'm not
27:44 - there's nothing that special about me
27:46 - okay um I'm a bad student in school I
27:49 - was terrible at math but I got pretty
27:51 - damn good at programming and the reason
27:53 - is one I developed a passion for it and
27:55 - just loved it so I was able to get
27:56 - through everything ever because it was
28:00 - just fun for me right isn't there
28:02 - something you love so much that you can
28:04 - have pain or hardship or obstacles and
28:07 - you just overcome it because you just
28:09 - love it so that's really what was going
28:11 - on with me and I was able to go on like
28:14 - meetup.com and I got super lucky because
28:17 - so many people try to network and they
28:19 - like meet random people and nothing just
28:21 - connects for them for me I was
28:23 - connecting and I ended up finding my
28:25 - mentor his name was Nick oh my God like
28:27 - he helped me accelerate like years
28:30 - Beyond years Beyond um in a very short
28:34 - amount of time and he would give me
28:35 - these personalized tasks and like this
28:37 - laser focused stuff to do and I would
28:39 - literally get good like this that was
28:42 - awesome uh Omar Pasha just joined Zang
28:45 - Zang just joined Kevin Navar just joined
28:48 - Ahmed karesi just
28:52 - joined I think I think it might be safe
28:54 - to say it's pretty lit up in here
28:59 - um awesome excited to have you guys okay
29:03 - so as I was saying what was I
29:07 - saying mentors uh yes so for me that has
29:11 - helped me a lot and then just being able
29:13 - to collaborate with like-minded students
29:15 - I used to go to this place called PS1 it
29:16 - was a co-working space so I think I got
29:20 - a membership I can't remember I think it
29:22 - was $150 a month and essentially you go
29:25 - there and you just cowork so I just
29:27 - wanted to find like-minded people there
29:29 - it was very difficult I found like maybe
29:31 - one or two people and it helped a lot
29:33 - because they were where I was and then
29:35 - they wanted to go where I wanted to go
29:37 - so it really helped us focus and work
29:40 - together and then my mentor would come
29:41 - in once in a while and then give me that
29:43 - boost and accelerate my skill set
29:46 - unbelievable okay so again something I
29:48 - was paying I think $150 something like
29:50 - that per
29:51 - month and for you guys if you join the
29:54 - slack Channel if you join the course and
29:56 - you join the slack Channel which is
29:59 - $47 we have a 100 plus students in the
30:02 - slack Channel like focused dedicated who
30:06 - want to take their career to the next
30:08 - level collaborate with them okay if you
30:11 - do decide to join
30:13 - okay please don't be one of those people
30:15 - who's just going to like sit there and
30:17 - do nothing take advantage of that use
30:19 - everybody around you like use them so
30:22 - you guys can do stuff together you can
30:24 - start your own app together you can
30:26 - build a website together you can like
30:28 - everybody want everybody who's in here
30:31 - wants to be doing something and if you
30:33 - can hold each other accountable and move
30:35 - forward I mean I personally think that's
30:37 - incredibly exciting I don't know about
30:39 - you
30:40 - guys all right
30:45 - um cs50 is Amazing Alex I'm uh cs50 is
30:50 - really cool I absolutely love it yes
30:53 - it's a good course it's for C uh but
30:55 - again the live community that slack
30:58 - channel is not there forums are there
31:00 - and forums are like I just hate them
31:03 - because you'll type in something and
31:04 - then you have to wait like days or
31:06 - something to get an answer and you can't
31:08 - really connect with people this is very
31:10 - different because you can you can just
31:11 - communicate with everybody you can like
31:14 - you can just text message me
31:16 - instantly right you can reach me
31:18 - instantly you can't do that at cs50 you
31:21 - can't reach that guy who's doing cs50
31:23 - okay uh and then once in a while like
31:26 - I'm very asked with my responses so I'll
31:28 - even like send you personalized V videos
31:30 - to answer your questions okay if I'm
31:32 - feeling if I'm in the mood otherwise
31:34 - I'll answer your questions through
31:35 - message really quickly all right cool we
31:38 - had another person joined Nicholas
31:46 - Cardona all right thank you Rachel for
31:48 - posting the PayPal Link in the Facebook
31:50 - Chat super cool we love
31:56 - Rachel if you guys want to make uh
31:59 - Rachel's life very miserable is like
32:02 - just enroll in the course and then
32:05 - she'll have she'll have to do so much
32:07 - work to enroll all you guys in
32:12 - manually Stephanie Lynn Chandler says it
32:15 - is hard to get off your site
32:18 - sometime uh didn't think I'd get into it
32:21 - so
32:23 - much programming is a world of its own
32:27 - it's beautiful it's
32:29 - magnificent when I'm programming I'm
32:32 - literally in My Own Zone like I wish I
32:35 - could have you here with me right now
32:38 - like what is
32:41 - this like I get my coffee okay I put my
32:44 - coffee down I'll like be sipping
32:47 - slurping on my coffee I'll be like
32:49 - writing my code I'll have my headsets in
32:52 - I like don't want any distractions so
32:54 - generally I would go work at night
32:57 - and uh so that way I don't have any
32:59 - distractions I could just focus and
33:01 - learn and I was logging in crazy days
33:03 - I'm talking 10 15 20 hour days that was
33:06 - also another one of my reasons to
33:08 - accelerate so fast and I just want to be
33:10 - clear guys when you get into this
33:13 - course I'm going to be doing everything
33:15 - I can to help boost you and to hold you
33:19 - accountable okay everybody else in the
33:20 - community is very driven but your
33:23 - success is your responsibility okay so I
33:26 - don't want people who who are like I'm
33:29 - look they're looking for some kind of
33:30 - magic bullet or they're looking for some
33:32 - kind of instant solution to their
33:34 - problem without any effort okay expect
33:36 - hard work expect to put in work ex
33:39 - expect to be involved okay like those
33:42 - things are actually your
33:43 - responsibilities they're not my
33:45 - responsibility they're not somebody
33:46 - else's responsibilities we will be there
33:49 - for you I will be there for you we're
33:51 - going to be in the slack Whatever
33:53 - Whenever you guys communicate we'll get
33:55 - back to you you know we'll constantly be
33:57 - adding new things to this course but you
34:01 - have to go through it right I don't want
34:03 - it to be one of those where you throw it
34:05 - in you know your trophy cabinet or
34:07 - whatever and then you just like don't do
34:09 - anything with it I do that on em me I'll
34:13 - go and just like buy like 20 different
34:15 - courses and just not even watch any of
34:17 - them so this course's whole job is to
34:19 - not be one of those because there's
34:21 - going to be constant involvement I'm
34:22 - going to send you personalized emails
34:25 - where I'm going to have special videos
34:27 - for people who join these are exclusive
34:29 - videos for nobody else outside okay I'm
34:32 - going to have special tricks and tricks
34:34 - and strategies for you guys whether it's
34:35 - for software Consulting negotiation
34:37 - skills tactics you know scripts for
34:40 - example for for some of you guys who
34:43 - joined the
34:47 - webinar who joined the webinar uh I said
34:50 - I'm going to share with you if you buy
34:51 - my course in that time I was going to
34:52 - share with you my
34:54 - $20,000 Craigslist ad a a post that I
34:58 - made that generated me TW over $20,000
35:01 - in two months okay and let me tell you
35:04 - about these two months it was May and
35:05 - June of last year and I visited
35:07 - California I worked remotely I was with
35:10 - my brother we went to mount Baldi Had
35:12 - the Time of Our Lives went on a freaking
35:14 - ski lift and that was really cool it was
35:16 - like snowing I think it was like May and
35:18 - June and on the top of the mountain when
35:20 - we went there it was like snowing so
35:22 - super cool like literally cool like
35:25 - Frozen um no I I meant it like just cool
35:29 - and then I just did a word play and that
35:33 - was an unbelievable experience like I
35:35 - had a lot of fun and then I went to see
35:37 - my nephew and the only reason I was able
35:40 - to do all those things was cuz I had a
35:42 - job where I had clients I was on I was
35:44 - My Own Boss You Could Be Your Own Boss
35:46 - if you have your multiple clients right
35:47 - treat yourself as a
35:49 - business don't think of your employers
35:52 - as employees or employers think of them
35:54 - as uh clients right so you have multiple
35:57 - of those and now you're not reliant on
35:59 - anybody for me the idea of a 9 to-5 job
36:02 - is not safe at all like that's just one
36:04 - job but you have 20 clients you're safe
36:07 - if one goes away you don't care you have
36:09 - 19 you can get another one more right
36:11 - you care about
36:13 - them but the beauty is that you get to
36:17 - focus on like not only do they get to be
36:21 - selective about you but you also get to
36:22 - be selective about them so imagine a
36:25 - life where you get to pick your own
36:27 - clients where you get to travel on your
36:30 - own right on your own command at any
36:32 - time for you guys what is it mean for
36:35 - you guys what would it mean to be
36:38 - financially like
36:40 - free right what would you guys do with
36:48 - that Ivo Ivanov I'm going to answer your
36:51 - courses and clever programmer are one of
36:53 - the few understandable for beginners
36:55 - thank you KY great work you are very
36:57 - welcome I'm glad you said that I'm going
36:59 - to answer I'm going to now look at some
37:01 - more unbiased questions Zane mik how
37:04 - long ago did you start study
37:06 - python Patrick says Patrick called me
37:09 - Zay mik that is a compliment Patrick I
37:12 - will take that compliment and I will
37:14 - wear my hat it's Hat Time
37:21 - guys all right 3 hours and 46 minutes
37:25 - remaining oh and best of all here this
37:28 - is a m mic drop moment so I'm going to
37:30 - not going to drop my keys I'm just going
37:31 - to drop my wallet so here mic drop
37:33 - moment okay you guys ready if you guys
37:36 - are ready let me know in the
37:40 - comments the course starts immediately

37:45 - immediately like the course content is
37:47 - already there we're only going to get
37:48 - new
37:49 - content yes you can still sign up cunder
37:53 - says I don't have any experience in
37:54 - programming should I still sign up yes
37:57 - uh if you want to of course like read
37:59 - about it you know don't just join cuz
38:01 - I'm saying it like do your own research
38:03 - but once you
38:07 - join and if you're on the border line
38:09 - and you're like I want to join but I
38:10 - want to join later well here let me give
38:12 - you a
38:13 - no-brainer the price is going to go up
38:17 - okay like it I know this course's value
38:20 - is way higher than
38:22 - $97 but because like all of you guys get
38:24 - to come in right now and we get more
38:26 - people and we kind of like build this
38:28 - course and make it even better together
38:31 - like that is exciting to me that is that
38:33 - should be exciting for you guys as well
38:36 - but later on the price of this course is
38:38 - going to go higher so if you're kind of
38:40 - on the fence I would suggest looking
38:41 - into it now so you're not paying a
38:43 - higher price now another no-brainer for
38:45 - you guys okay 30-day moneybag guarantee
38:49 - um here my my money back is a my money

39:54 - you Hwang says says how do you delete
39:57 - that comment that you just post H kuang
39:59 - I wouldn't be deleting comments I
40:01 - wouldn't be posting comments that I want
40:03 - to
40:06 - [Laughter]
40:09 - delete J di says sha please say please
40:13 - say or JD sha says please say hi hi Hi
40:16 - how are you
40:17 - doing sham says if I get a certification
40:20 - from Harvard on etex is it as valuable
40:22 - or not I mean that will it give me a
40:23 - return on my investment your return on
40:26 - invest M does not and I repeat does not
40:30 - come from
40:31 - you passively learning collecting
40:35 - certifications and doing nothing about
40:37 - them you know how I know because I have
40:40 - like all the certifications on Cera and
40:42 - eics and free Cod camp and all of that
40:44 - stuff okay your return on investment
40:48 - comes to you when you get your ass out
40:50 - of your chair and hustle and find work
40:56 - that's really what it is and I will show
40:59 - you that and I will teach you
41:00 - that but that's really where it comes
41:03 - from okay yes your skills will always
41:06 - matter but one of the biggest mistakes I
41:10 - see people making especially in the
41:12 - engineering world they're
41:17 - like our skills are so good that we're
41:20 - not going to go out and uh help anybody
41:23 - we're just going to expect everybody to
41:25 - come to us okay okay we're just going to
41:27 - let everybody flock to us big mistake my
41:31 - friend yange she says Mr mull please
41:35 - give yangi a shout out so Yang yangi uh
41:39 - she was actually on the webinar today I
41:41 - don't know if you guys remember that she
41:43 - came uh when everything went to chaos
41:46 - that was kind of exciting I have fun
41:48 - when there's chaos and she
41:51 - absolutely uh you know killed it what
41:53 - she did is she watched one of our free
41:55 - videos at clever programmer okay
41:57 - literally free video It's called four
42:00 - ways to make more money starting today
42:02 - and you know what she did that was
42:04 - different than 99.5% of the people want
42:07 - to take a
42:08 - guess
42:10 - she took
42:15 - action it's as simple as that sometimes
42:18 - she decided to take action and follow
42:20 - through instead of passively watch
42:22 - because you know like I told her 99.5%
42:25 - of the people you can give them all the
42:27 - advice in the world they'll just sit
42:29 - there and take it and just be like yeah
42:30 - yeah that makes sense I knew that yeah
42:33 - okay the I knew it syndrome I hate it
42:37 - with my
42:38 - guts people who say I knew
42:42 - it I hate that word like if you if you
42:45 - could take my number one skill from me
42:47 - and steal it okay you know what it would
42:49 - be it would not be um intelligence or
42:53 - math Wizardry because that's not
42:54 - required for programming but you know
42:56 - what it would
42:59 - be would be my skill to be teachable
43:03 - like literally I can I can be a sponge I
43:06 - just shut up listen and
43:08 - learn Stephanie says that's the worst
43:10 - yep I agree Stephanie that's the worst
43:12 - the I knew it
43:14 - syndrome like these people just like ah
43:16 - yeah I knew it sometimes even if you
43:18 - know just shut up and don't say anything
43:20 - you'll and really let those words sink
43:22 - in you'll be surprised the effect they
43:24 - have on you Devin says you Bulls fan I
43:26 - don't watch so I don't watch
43:31 - basketball I watch soccer I love soccer
43:34 - I play
43:36 - soccer yeah the Samba Soccer oh that's
43:40 - hilarious his name is the Samba Soccer
43:42 - whose question I'm about to go to how
43:43 - much will the price go up I want to
43:45 - learn code and I want to be a part of
43:46 - what you're doing but I only have had
43:48 - two days to think about spending $97
43:50 - Samba Soccer let me make it really easy
43:52 - for you yes you have two days to think
43:54 - about well
43:56 - well you actually have I think if you
43:59 - look at the time right here you actually
44:01 - only have three hours left to think
44:02 - about it but here let me make it very
44:04 - simple in 30 days if you don't like it
44:07 - you refund okay so you get to you get to
44:12 - kind of try it out and learn those
44:14 - things okay and and see if it's right
44:15 - for you but I totally get it you're like
44:18 - I don't know if I should make this
44:19 - investment or not and you're not ready
44:22 - sometimes you're not ready to pull the
44:24 - trigger that's okay
44:26 - um I'll still be here 99% of my material
44:31 - is free still gives you amazing results
44:33 - like for example I got distracted by
44:35 - Yang she watched one of the videos took
44:38 - action and went in one day or in three
44:41 - days 72 hours from having $13 an hour
44:45 - job to having multiple 50 plus an hour
44:51 - clients $13 an hour here to $50 an hour
44:59 - with multiple
45:01 - clients in 72
45:04 - hours my hand is not even in the screens
45:07 - anymore that's how much of a that's the
45:09 - Boost that she got okay and you know
45:13 - yeah so apply yourself her return on the
45:17 - investment of watching a free video at
45:19 - clever programmer this month is going to
45:21 - be
45:21 - $800 just this month extra just extra
45:24 - income okay extra income she's only
45:27 - working like just a few hours extra and
45:29 - what's her work she's going to be like
45:30 - doing table tennis lessons or something
45:32 - fun okay and even if it's a chemistry
45:34 - lesson or whatever but she applied those
45:37 - strategies and she landed you know
45:40 - multiple clients so that return on the
45:42 - investment I mean what is that how do I
45:44 - say that Infinity right I mean my
45:47 - calculus isn't the strongest but I have
45:49 - taken Cal 1 2 3 and differential
45:51 - equations and advanced mathematics which
45:55 - I don't use any day the the biggest
45:57 - thing I use is algebra
45:59 - nowadays they tell you you're going to
46:00 - use math but you really don't and then
46:02 - you just use libraries I use libraries
46:05 - and I teach PhD
46:07 - students I have Master students who I'm
46:10 - helping and able to teach why cuz I love
46:13 - programming and you can too like I'm
46:15 - just telling you this not to brag but to
46:17 - literally tell you that there is nothing
46:20 - special about me okay and you can get
46:23 - these same results you can get even
46:25 - better results by just being persistent
46:27 - okay how I became top 1% in the world
46:30 - for chess was here's the hack I replaced
46:34 - Netflix with
46:36 - tutorials ultimate
46:39 - hack Netflix with
46:43 - tutorials music car driving commuting
46:47 - time music with
46:52 - audible cunder says I am signed up
46:55 - thanks kazzy cunder did you sign can I
46:58 - get your Craigslist stuff cunder when
47:00 - did you join if you join
47:04 - now if you join now you don't get the
47:06 - Craigslist stuff you you get it in the
47:13 - webinar Stephanie asks how much do you
47:15 - suggest you charge uh for your first
47:18 - client
47:20 - Yang Yang is on point she just started
47:23 - audible she is like increasing her
47:26 - income like exponentially I love it
47:29 - Stephanie good question let me answer
47:30 - that right now okay for you
47:33 - so for your first
47:36 - client I'm kind of crazy I'm really
47:38 - aggressive with my Approach but
47:45 - like if you're if you're like if you're
47:48 - medium comfortable with what you're
47:50 - teaching and you're like teaching
47:51 - somebody who's one step behind you you
47:53 - can start off at $50 an hour
47:57 - okay um that's kind of like an expected
48:00 - rate if you want to play it safe go
48:03 - maybe 35 or 40 but don't disrespect
48:05 - yourself okay understand your value and
48:08 - if you're helping somebody solve their
48:10 - problem then it doesn't matter what what
48:13 - you're charging okay I know some of us
48:16 - have that pain and it hurts to charge
48:18 - more but my biggest thing that I tell
48:20 - people is charge uncomfortably High when
48:23 - it makes you uncomfortable that's
48:26 - you're charging the right price okay
48:28 - that's really what it
48:39 - is what Udi courses did you enroll into
48:42 - Billy nir asks me oh my God man I
48:45 - enrolled in some like programming
48:47 - courses for like python long time ago um
48:50 - oh my God and they're
48:53 - so I don't want to say they're bad but
48:55 - they're like bad because uh they're made
48:59 - by a software developer who like didn't
49:01 - make them with love wanted to make money
49:03 - and just like went and just shot it in
49:05 - like one ghost boring screencast they
49:08 - don't try to like make it exciting
49:09 - Udacity makes it exciting they have a
49:12 - production budget like their V their
49:14 - video quality is High I mean so it's
49:16 - cool and it's nice to watch them but
49:19 - udem is like
49:22 - [Music]
49:24 - G
49:30 - yeah so I have I have some reading
49:32 - courses I learned about Bitcoin from you
49:34 - to me and uh I think I made like $99,000
49:38 - in like a few months doing Bitcoin stuff
49:40 - I really got into it so I you know I had
49:43 - my family like invest in it when I was
49:45 - younger I was like 16 and I started like
49:47 - learning about it and then you know we
49:50 - made trades it was so freaking
49:53 - scary um it was literally so scary doing
49:57 - stuff with
49:59 - um uh with Bitcoin and like getting my
50:02 - family involved cuz I was young and I
50:04 - didn't really have that much income and
50:05 - I got my family to invest like 15 or
50:10 - $20,000 and I was like handling
50:12 - everybody's money and I was like putting
50:13 - it in a certain exchange I picked it up
50:16 - from udem me and literally all I did was
50:17 - replace Netflix with uh you to me so
50:20 - like it didn't affect my social life it
50:22 - didn't affect like I still got to go out
50:23 - I still got to have fun still got to
50:25 - meet with my friends like that's what
50:27 - I'm talking about these are really
50:28 - simple hacks you can apply um and just
50:31 - really take it to the next
50:33 - level can I pay for the course in
50:35 - Bitcoin steam do says no you can't I'm
50:38 - sorry I wish I used to do that a lot but
50:40 - I stopped doing stuff with
50:43 - Bitcoin how long have you been mining oh
50:47 - you ask somebody I I used to do Bitcoin
50:50 - mining as well that was really cool like
50:52 - I had my laptop sitting there and it was
50:54 - generating money I thought that was was
50:55 - crazy I was like what is
50:58 - this
50:59 - [Music]
51:00 - um yeah and then like really crazy stuff
51:03 - happened it was really intense it's a
51:04 - long story I'm not going to go into it
51:06 - but um my heart was beating like crazy
51:10 - especially the last few days but I got
51:12 - out on the profitable end if my family
51:15 - actually didn't freak out the Bitcoin
51:18 - actually went down to $200 and they got
51:20 - scared and they wanted to leave and I
51:22 - told them don't and if they didn't they
51:24 - took that loss and they wrote it out
51:26 - right now it's at $1,200 or $1,000 or
51:28 - something I'm pretty sure so that's 5x
51:32 - so them investing
51:35 - $115,000 we would have been sitting at
51:37 - what
51:39 - $75,000 right
51:42 - so sometimes it's like you know you got
51:44 - to write it out a little
51:46 - bit Alexander Sanchez
51:49 - Mustafa Mustafa is my
51:52 - brother uh he's the reason why I started
51:55 - my YouTu YouTube channel um he gave me
51:58 - huge motivation so I am humbled that
52:02 - Mustafa you're here and in my channel
52:05 - this guy's crazy he has two YouTube
52:07 - channels with like 20,000
52:09 - subscribers and it's unbelievable and
52:12 - just thank you for helping me start
52:15 - mine Alexander can I pay for the course
52:17 - yes you can pay for the course now my
52:18 - friend uh 3 hours left 3 hours and 31
52:22 - minutes you can pay for it now the
52:24 - deadline will be up in 3 hours and 31
52:26 - minutes and no I won't be sneaking in
52:28 - anybody through the back door I mean
52:29 - when it's done it's done like you just
52:32 - miss the deadline like if you woke up
52:34 - five minutes late and missed it you just
52:36 - missed it that's that's just all it is
52:39 - because that otherwise I'd be be unfair
52:41 - to 10,000 students enrolled in clever
52:46 - programmer um what libraries and
52:48 - Frameworks are using so again my whole
52:51 - idea is not to be one of those udemy
52:53 - courses that just like that person is
52:56 - already a software developer with 20
52:58 - years of experience so he just like goes
53:00 - through the entire course doesn't care
53:01 - about you and what happens is you follow
53:05 - him and you copy his code and you feel
53:06 - like a big boy or a big
53:10 - girl and then you sit and stare at a
53:13 - blank screen you're just like scratching
53:14 - your head and you're like what the hell
53:16 - is this like I can't even write one line
53:19 - of code uh but then you like try to
53:22 - impress your friends and say hey look
53:24 - what I made which you make you followed
53:26 - and you just like yeah so I stay away
53:29 - from that okay Frameworks and all that
53:32 - stuff you'll learn them they're super
53:33 - easy but I gave you fundamentals so
53:36 - you're ready to BR build all of this
53:38 - stuff on your own that's really what I
53:40 - want to focus on I don't want to focus
53:41 - on other things We'll add the other
53:44 - things okay don't worry about them Aaron
53:46 - cut back cuu back joined just a little
53:50 - bit
53:51 - ago let's see Devon Mitchell no
53:55 - Elena Lazarus joined great
54:02 - cool yeah guys we're manually enrolling
54:05 - everybody because what I said is so you
54:07 - see how on Clever
54:09 - program.com o another person is joining
54:12 - I'm gonna call him out sikander Khan
54:14 - just joined welcome buddy I just got you
54:18 - he just joined from Facebook I got
54:20 - Facebook going I got YouTube going it's
54:22 - crazy it's lit up in here so keep
54:26 - here okay anyways let me let me answer
54:29 - some qu Yeah so basically what we're
54:31 - trying to do is um if you join any
54:34 - clever program.com course it
54:36 - automatically enrolls you right you're
54:37 - in this course once you pay for it we
54:41 - enroll you uh we enroll you manually so
54:44 - don't like freak out like we'll enroll
54:46 - you just in a little bit I personally
54:48 - want to enroll as many people as I can
54:50 - it helps me learn everybody's names I'm
54:52 - kind of weird in that sense I'm kind of
54:54 - crazy about that so I want to get to
54:56 - know everybody and I want my team to get
54:58 - to know everybody while they're
54:59 - enrolling you so yeah it might take an
55:01 - extra second but I just think it's
55:03 - really freaking cool cuz then
55:04 - everybody's on board and we all kind of
55:06 - know each other including the team at
55:08 - clever programmer like I just I don't
55:10 - think many people do that and they
55:12 - really get to know you guys and I feel
55:14 - like we get to know you guys and it's
55:15 - cool and then it's really funny also cuz
55:19 - then Rachel is like screaming and she's
55:20 - like oh my God so many people are
55:22 - joining and I can't keep up and I can't
55:24 - enroll every everybody so I I mean it's
55:27 - just kind of funny and I think
55:30 - um uh you guys you
55:33 - know you guys should do that make her
55:35 - life
55:37 - miserable all right greatest ever python
55:40 - instructor I read automate you're boring
55:43 - Stu with python for another programmer
55:44 - but just a fancy title No reality unlike
55:46 - your videos are great
55:49 - dbf another person just joined
55:53 - nice Timothy
55:57 - Samson where is
55:59 - Timothy
56:05 - Timothy all right Timothy where are
56:08 - you I don't see Timothy anywhere oh
56:11 - maybe he's not in here yeah code academy
56:14 - it's
56:16 - like I don't know it just makes me roll
56:18 - my eyes there's a reason why my free
56:22 - code academy course is number one and
56:25 - and here's why it's because
56:28 - um I'm really weird with how I learn woo
56:32 - another
56:34 - join I you guys are you guys are really
56:37 - cool you guys are just a bunch of cool
56:40 - people you guys are just a bunch of cool
56:43 - people uh let me finish my goddamn
56:46 - sentence I'm sorry but I'm G to finish
56:48 - my
56:50 - sentence all
56:52 - right um code academy was what they do
56:55 - well I'm not a huge okay so here's why
56:57 - my course is really doing really good
56:59 - it's really killing it it's because of
57:00 - how I learn and how I think
57:06 - so I'm like really slow to learn
57:10 - something but then the longer I spend in
57:12 - it I learn it really fast so a lot of
57:15 - you guys are really amazing like you
57:19 - guys have no idea but a lot of you guys
57:20 - might not give yourself credit but a lot
57:22 - of you guys can actually learn things
57:23 - faster than I can like you and I will
57:26 - sit down and you'll read a little bit of
57:27 - the book and you'll know it like right
57:30 - away or like you'll remember that part
57:33 - and for me I it won't even like register
57:35 - with me for a long time like it'll take
57:37 - me 5 hours but then the longer time I
57:40 - spend with it the better I get which is
57:43 - why I kind of got killed in school uh in
57:46 - a lot of places cuz it was hard for me
57:48 - to like I'm not I'm not slow I'm fast
57:52 - but like you know there's certain things
57:53 - like chemistry Labs or what whatever I
57:55 - just I'm like not sure what's going
57:57 - on but then I'd spend eight hours of my
58:00 - own time because I'd get so passionate
58:02 - and then I'd have this Insight that
58:03 - nobody else has so that was another kind
58:07 - of part of it and that really helps me
58:09 - another person just joined Sammy Bai
58:12 - welcome so yeah that's kind of what
58:14 - happens you know like um that helps me
58:16 - build my code academy course or all my
58:18 - courses and then what's great is when
58:20 - you guys are learning I just feel like
58:23 - since I'm so slow in learning
58:25 - I ask all the questions you might not
58:27 - even ask so that's why they're so step
58:29 - by step and that's why you can learn all
58:31 - of that stuff so well taking those
58:33 - courses that I'm making so it's like my
58:36 - weird way of thinking actually helps you
58:43 - guys Timothy nice Tim sson says I'm here
58:47 - he's Timothy Samson he just joined uh
58:50 - Sammy Bai just joined again 3 hours 25
58:54 - minutes to go guys cool good

59:36 - have been looking for just joined
59:40 - Tyler my
59:43 - friend that is what it's about okay
59:45 - sometimes you got to go I'm about to

59:55 - out you can Retreat right like have some
59:58 - options in the back of your head that
59:59 - where you can Retreat right the 30 money
60:01 - 30-day money back guarantee just go like
60:04 - I'm going to go hard for 29 days and if
60:07 - it doesn't pan
60:08 - out yeah I'll I'll I'll I'll return it
60:12 - okay but don't just rely on that fall

60:30 - initiative and you know and get inside
60:32 - the course because we're excited to have
60:34 - you man we're
60:38 - excited let me see more beautiful I have
60:42 - some
60:45 - Jada Jada Bara love that
60:49 - [Applause]
60:50 - name Jada Bara says hi I have some basic
60:55 - knowledge in oop AKA objectoriented
60:58 - programming you better not be the I knew
60:59 - it Syndrome guy I will jump on you I
61:03 - have read from read the book from um
61:07 - John zel that you have recommended in
61:08 - your python course and can say I
61:10 - understood it well will this will this
61:12 - your course be still valuable for me I
61:15 - mean I would not be sitting here telling
61:17 - you guys to join it if it's not valuable
61:19 - for you like I'm not here to waste your
61:21 - time I take your time very seriously I
61:23 - take literally I take your time more
61:25 - seriously than I take my time which is
61:27 - why like I think for hours before I go
61:29 - on webinar like I actually have
61:30 - something valuable for you guys again
61:33 - 99% of my material is free go enjoy it
61:37 - learn it like Yang from free material
61:40 - she got th000 she got $800 return on
61:43 - investment just this month in 72 hours
61:46 - just to be clear now imagine what's
61:48 - going to happen this month imagine
61:50 - what's that going to do for the next 12
61:51 - months if she sticks with the next 12
61:53 - months we're talking a 12K return on
61:56 - investment of 5 minutes of her time not
61:59 - even any money infinite
62:02 - infinite infinite percentage growth okay
62:06 - so it's possible for you guys right we
62:08 - have some Freelancers we in our course
62:11 - who are Freelancers but then they're
62:13 - actually taking the course getting those
62:15 - Tech skills and then able to charge a
62:18 - higher
62:20 - price right so there are multiple ways
62:22 - you can go about it one of the people at
62:24 - clever programmer actually got
62:26 - promoted right that's cool what's the
62:30 - return on investment on that maybe
62:31 - $20,000 extra like holy that's
62:35 - crazy I mean you're watching free
62:37 - YouTube videos and you just made $20,000
62:39 - extra per year like in the next 5 years
62:44 - I mean this just humbles me so much I
62:46 - would have helped somebody who just
62:48 - watch a few YouTube videos Earn $100,000
62:51 - in the next five years what does that
62:53 - mean for them they're able to take out
62:55 - their family to places they're able to
62:57 - hold their head up high and go to any
62:59 - place and do kind of make their own
63:01 - decision without being worried like they
63:02 - need to borrow their money from somebody
63:04 - they don't have to feel like they owe
63:05 - anybody else right how many of us hate
63:08 - that feeling of owing other people's
63:10 - stuff right I hated it that's why ever
63:13 - since I was like 14 one of my friends uh
63:16 - Sager and I owe a lot of my stuff to him
63:19 - because he was one of the first people
63:22 - that actually he got me a chess job
63:25 - I was like 14 or 15 at the time and I
63:27 - didn't have any job and I was about to
63:29 - go into I was going to be a security
63:30 - guard right I didn't know anything and I
63:32 - was like I'm I'm just going to be a
63:33 - security guard it's going to be a cool
63:35 - job CU I get to sleep for like eight
63:36 - hours and it's going to be awesome like
63:38 - I'm just going to make 10 bucks an hour
63:40 - like totally I was disrespectful of my
63:42 - time I didn't respect it at that time
63:44 - right I didn't know any better and he
63:45 - got me this job and I mean he he he
63:48 - wasn't interested in it so he just
63:50 - passed it along but what I did is I just
63:52 - took initiative and I jumped on it and
63:54 - and after that my life changed because
63:57 - it it started my Consulting career
63:59 - before I even knew it because the whole
64:01 - job is like you make they pay you $35 an
64:03 - hour and you go and teach kids I mean
64:06 - they're younger kids they're like 9 10
64:08 - year olds and seven year olds but like
64:10 - still you're you're doing a public speak
64:13 - every time so that has helped me that's
64:15 - why I'm not nervous when I'm talking to
64:17 - like I'm actually able to connect with
64:18 - you and talk with you and if we were in
64:20 - person I would have a pretty amazing
64:22 - time with you but it helped then like
64:25 - their parents would be there and then we
64:27 - we would have like 50 students sometimes
64:29 - with like 20 parents being able to speak
64:31 - in front of them so again it was like
64:33 - not even about earning at that time it
64:35 - was about learning right he says in Rich
64:37 - Dad Poor
64:38 - Dad um he say something like you know
64:43 - you should be focusing on earning or
64:44 - sorry learning and not earning
64:46 - especially in the start because then you
64:48 - get that exponential growth right
64:50 - because you are not putting in Standard
64:52 - Act you're not doing standard things so
64:54 - you don't get standard results you get
64:56 - like crazy results like a clever
64:58 - programmer people's YouTube channels
65:00 - take four years to get the results this
65:02 - YouTube channel did amazing in three to
65:04 - four months right it was because I
65:06 - wasn't putting in standard uh
65:09 - action people work hard on their videos
65:12 - and they produce one good edited video a
65:14 - day I'm like how about 30 good edited
65:19 - videos a month like I'm sorry they would
65:21 - put one good edited video a month right
65:24 - and I'm like how about 30 good edited
65:26 - videos a month like holy that's
65:28 - just 10x 30X and uh you get yourself in
65:32 - that mindset and you make it happen like
65:34 - it's possible and so really you know
65:37 - that's one thing I want to give you guys
65:39 - is like a lot of it is in here right
65:41 - that like insecurity and all that it's
65:43 - going to hold you back in a lot of the
65:44 - things you do in your life whether you
65:45 - take this course or not whatever the
65:47 - hell you guys are doing in your life you
65:51 - know don't be insecure like make up your
65:53 - mind and then go go for it give it your
65:55 - all before you kind of look back and try
65:57 - to fall back plans or point fingers and
65:59 - blame other people cuz I want you guys
66:01 - to be successful I want you to be
66:02 - successful
66:04 - okay all right PowerUp says Rachel send
66:07 - me the link please and Rachel did not
66:10 - send him the link it's okay uh we still
66:12 - love you Rachel don't worry guys the
66:14 - link is in my uh description so don't
66:18 - make Rachel overwork herself just
66:23 - kidding
66:24 - KSP in the
66:27 - building that's Kitty guys she's a star
66:30 - student at clever programmer she became
66:33 - so badass by joining clever programmer
66:36 - that she went from knowing nothing she
66:39 - was one of those code cademy stuck in
66:40 - hell rinse and repeat just I'll just do
66:43 - code academy 500 times maybe that'll
66:45 - like trigger something in my
66:47 - brain right didn't work for her she
66:51 - joined clever programmer got good
66:52 - results and now she has has her own
66:54 - website it's called The Savvy coder.com
66:57 - and she's even posting blogs like that's
67:00 - cool that's success when she goes her to
67:02 - her employee or her employer they're
67:04 - going to see that and they're going to
67:06 - like she's not going to have to sit
67:07 - there and negotiate price they're going
67:10 - to be like what what do you want right
67:12 - so once you put in that effort those are
67:14 - the results you get they're very
67:16 - non-standard results they're exponential
67:18 - results right
67:20 - so uh yeah all right the course is
67:25 - amazing go freaking enroll uh ESP says
67:30 - shafik says I'll join now now
67:35 - now if I get that email I'll announce
67:37 - your
67:40 - name it's all about now baby now or
67:43 - never it's 3 hours and 16 minutes from
67:46 - now or
67:48 - never um if things trigger right with
67:51 - you you get that instinct like it it's
67:55 - it's
67:56 - cool right it it uh you like
67:59 - it then don't K the Kazi hop yes I am
68:05 - that is indeed you just witnessed the
68:07 - Kazi hop that was pretty
68:09 - weird Sunny Torres in the
68:14 - building now we're getting some OG
68:16 - students these are like the the original
68:20 - Squad of clever programmer we just got
68:22 - another person to
68:25 - join
68:27 - woohoo what the hell Sony Sony Torres
68:32 - just
68:35 - joined
68:36 - Oh shoot that's really hilarious because
68:44 - uh Sony Torres was on the fence for like
68:48 - eight three months and he was working
68:49 - one-on-one with me I don't know why it
68:51 - took you so long to join sunny you were
68:54 - doing oneon-one with me it cost you so
68:56 - it costs you so much more and you get 10
69:00 - plus hours of recorded content you get
69:02 - live sessions I'm there the whole team
69:04 - is there get to network with people let
69:07 - me reframe a few things for you guys to
69:10 - work with a professional you know like
69:12 - uh you know to work with somebody who's
69:14 - professional in this field you're
69:15 - generally paying them between 50 to $150
69:19 - or $250 an hour or more I was paying one
69:22 - of my mentors back in the day $75 an
69:26 - hour and that was one hour it was
69:29 - invaluable but that was just one hour of
69:31 - her time why I would pay her that much
69:33 - was cuz I would have a problem she would
69:36 - solve it I would have a problem she
69:37 - would solve it and I'm like whatever
69:38 - I'll pay
69:41 - her if you get
69:43 - that for one payment of $97 you get t 10
69:47 - plus hours premium content
69:50 - recorded you can pay you can play it at
69:53 - your own Pace you can watch it wherever
69:55 - you are $75 an hour to 10 plus hours of
70:01 - videos for only
70:03 - $97 you also have live sessions you can
70:05 - also collaborate with other students one
70:07 - of my favorite things is like you get
70:09 - stuck at some stupid thing it'll take
70:11 - you three hours to get past it but you
70:13 - go in the slack channel right our slack
70:15 - Channel and you post something we are
70:18 - ninjas we will be right there and tell
70:20 - you like no you're being you're being
70:22 - dumb delete that thing and then the
70:24 - something that took you 6 hours and you
70:26 - were stuck on now it took you 30 seconds
70:30 - and you've moved past it so those are
70:33 - just few of the things that are pretty
70:35 - unbelievable like it'll get you much
70:38 - faster results cool we just got another
70:43 - enrollment all right cunder says hash
70:48 - best best decision ever # Freedom yes
70:52 - okay you put in the effort and we can
70:56 - get you results okay we this course will
70:59 - get you
71:02 - results I think I think
71:04 - honestly um if you're interested in
71:07 - programming like not only is it a great
71:10 - investment I
71:12 - just like I'm trying to be really
71:14 - unbiased here and I'm thinking like if I
71:16 - was on the side of you guys and I was
71:17 - trying to
71:20 - join like for me it would be like a
71:22 - no-brainer
71:25 - cuz I would think okay like I do this
71:28 - and then I'll like have two sessions
71:29 - with people back in the day then I get
71:31 - my money back and then I just get like
71:33 - extra time doing this and then the
71:35 - skills I learn here apply and make more
71:36 - money that's what I've always done I
71:38 - would take these online courses
71:40 - immediately apply them to my current
71:42 - jobs or like look for opportunities that
71:45 - required those skills so then basically
71:47 - I was earning while I was learning so
71:50 - one cool thing you can do while you're
71:52 - taking this course is you can
71:53 - immediately the things you're learning
71:55 - here right let's say I teach you how to
71:56 - build an app immediately go and give
71:59 - somebody a lesson charge them and help
72:01 - them build a similar app that will one
72:04 - hone your understanding of this make you
72:06 - an expert and two you get to give
72:09 - somebody else results and then obviously
72:12 - three money is just a symptom of you
72:14 - doing something right okay so then
72:17 - obviously they're going to pay you
72:18 - they're going to be like cool you just
72:19 - helped me with something really
72:22 - awesome this course is not going to be
72:24 - deleted after tonight I think Au oh yeah
72:28 - no not deleted that would be horrible I
72:30 - would not delete this course but what
72:32 - happens is that the course is locked
72:36 - after the deadline so no new people can
72:38 - register that's what
72:45 - happens
72:49 - Sunny yeah air horns
72:52 - exactly
72:56 - ah
73:02 - says another person just joined oh man I
73:05 - better start calling out these names man
73:07 - I'm so
73:10 - sorry all right
73:12 - here okay ton oh wait hold on Toya
73:17 - Williams just joined Toya Williams where
73:19 - are where you
73:20 - at
73:22 - um Josh Josh mow just
73:26 - joined Josh
73:30 - mow and
73:32 - Alexandro PR just joined alesandro PR
73:37 - just joined I think I just went really
73:39 - native there even though I'm not
73:52 - native okay more questions from you guys
73:55 - Sunny says hey I wanted to I want I I
73:59 - don't think it's a question but I'm
74:00 - going to read it anyways I wanted to
74:02 - learn Financial modeling and data
74:04 - manipulation first and then learn how to
74:06 - integrate into Apps but I want to learn
74:08 - how to integrate the two
74:13 - now so this is what I mean like he wrote
74:15 - this big question and because I read it
74:17 - out loud I didn't really understand it
74:19 - so like I have to read it quietly and
74:21 - like take my time and then understand it
74:24 - it's so weird I don't know how to
74:25 - explain it but once I understand it I
74:27 - start getting a really deep
74:29 - understanding like I start seeing
74:30 - through the page and stuff and like
74:32 - things start changing colors I get like
74:34 - these really weird
74:52 - insights
74:55 - so Sunny wants to do basically data
74:57 - manipulation Financial
74:59 - modeling and combine it into Apps wow
75:03 - okay yeah that would be really cool
75:05 - because
75:06 - um the I mean there are lots of
75:08 - companies that are going to use that uh
75:11 - and are going to need help with that and
75:13 - I know Sunny where you work you have a
75:14 - pretty good understanding of what you're
75:15 - going to be using this for Facebook
75:18 - stream I wish the page would change
75:20 - colors whenever I think deeply but I
75:22 - guess not yeah yeah Yang you got to you
75:25 - got to get at that
75:27 - level yeah I don't know
75:30 - why oh ah I'm so sorry I was about to
75:33 - say something about you oh yeah yeah
75:35 - yeah okay man I get distracted so easily
75:38 - yo no one wants to take the lesson from
75:40 - me I swear to God I'm about to get over
75:42 - there and grab you by the collar and
75:44 - Shake Your Soul yes there are people who
75:47 - want to take a lesson with you I'm
75:48 - serious you're unless you're just some
75:51 - evil human being like some people even
75:55 - like evil human beings we're we're weird
75:58 - people um you are here I'll tell you
76:01 - something uh really weird I'm going to
76:03 - get inside of your head and it's going
76:04 - to hurt hearing it you're using this as
76:06 - an excuse so you don't have to
76:09 - work and you can so you can justify it
76:11 - to yourself mentally and give yourself
76:14 - that leeway that break so you don't have
76:16 - to do it and this is some this is a
76:19 - common excuse you can tell to other
76:20 - people too to waight off what you're
76:21 - doing it's like when people say
76:23 - oh I'm just not I just wasn't meant for
76:26 - like going to the
76:27 - gym
76:29 - really I just wasn't meant for
76:33 - um you
76:35 - know uh I don't know like learning
76:37 - programming no you you you weren't meant
76:41 - for any like you weren't born to do one
76:44 - thing specifically but you can through
76:47 - habit and through time and actually
76:50 - persistent you you can make pretty much
76:52 - anything happen okay so yeah you can
76:55 - definitely you'll have a uh coming back
76:58 - to you you can you'll definitely have
77:00 - people who want lessons from you you
77:01 - just have to persist look for those
77:03 - people and offer them something of value
77:05 - okay if people are really not doing uh
77:07 - want work with you um then you need to
77:11 - work on your uh soft skills you need to
77:13 - actually like go hang out with more
77:15 - people be a more likable person cuz it
77:18 - doesn't matter if you can do programming
77:19 - nobody wants to hire a person they don't
77:21 - like okay so if you're the problem and
77:24 - you've identified that then you need to
77:26 - go and work on your like social skills
77:30 - and just generally like just meet more
77:32 - people hang out don't even worry about
77:34 - programming for a little while it's
77:35 - important like I'm serious it'll help
77:37 - you uh even mon monetarily speaking like
77:41 - MoneyWise is going to help you work with
77:43 - more people cuz again like people work
77:47 - emotionally right you want to work with
77:48 - people who you
77:52 - like
77:53 - uh hopefully Ahad that answers it I'm
77:55 - sorry I came down on you so
78:01 - hard Sam says after this programing is
78:04 - over we should all go to California yes
78:07 - I I I think once we get a few I don't
78:10 - know like I I might want to do like a
78:11 - live event with you guys honestly CU
78:14 - it's a pretty cool community so I might
78:16 - do a live event or I might bring um like
78:21 - what I would actually like to do is
78:23 - some star students who are doing really
78:25 - good I'll fly you out here no problem
78:28 - like I'll fly you out here you can have
78:31 - uh lunch with me we'll hang out we'll go
78:33 - play some pool go bowling catch a movie
78:36 - we'll do like a live interview um and
78:39 - then we'll record it for everybody to
78:40 - see or just do like a live webinar go
78:43 - live in front of everybody I think it'll
78:45 - be cool
78:46 - so I would be very happy to do
78:51 - that
78:55 - Ivo Ivanov says how long it took you for
78:58 - you to actually start developing your
78:59 - own ideas without having language
79:01 - difficulties that's actually a really
79:03 - insightful questions people who are
79:05 - going to be successful ask really like
79:08 - insightful questions so um first of all
79:12 - I want to congratulate you on your
79:13 - question and here's what I want to say
79:15 - about
79:18 - that I started my career I got into the
79:21 - world of programming while one of them
79:23 - is my brother my little brother calling
79:24 - me telling me about Hadoop and saying
79:26 - how college students right outside of
79:27 - college right out of college make
79:29 - $200,000 using Hadoop so that was that
79:32 - was cool but something that really got
79:36 - me interested was I was running my
79:39 - business called uh chess tastic and it
79:41 - was for chess okay so again I play chess
79:44 - competitively I like compete at all
79:46 - levels uh top 1% in the country if not
79:49 - the world
79:51 - and what I did was actually started my
79:54 - own chess business and I had my company
79:56 - and we would offer programs at libraries
79:58 - and schools and all that you know ever
80:00 - since I was a very young like probably
80:01 - 18
80:02 - 19 um I've just always been an
80:04 - entrepreneur like it's just in my blood
80:07 - I can't help it for me it's more risky
80:09 - to think about like 9 to5 jobs honestly
80:12 - it scares me cuz I'm like wait so how do
80:15 - you feel safe there just one client and
80:18 - if they fire you you're like done so
80:20 - how's how's there Security in that but
80:22 - me I always try to have like more
80:23 - clients and then the beauty is that
80:26 - again not only do they get to be
80:28 - selective about you you get to be
80:29 - selective about them and everybody
80:31 - respects each other and U it's just more
80:34 - fun it's a more healthy relationship
80:37 - between the two nobody is anybody's boss
80:39 - right you're like friends essentially
80:41 - and you offer each other value and you
80:43 - bring better things into each other's
80:45 - life okay so um Ivo I started in chess
80:51 - and basically what I was trying to do
80:53 - was I was trying to write this algorithm
80:55 - that scrapes the web and pulls out all
80:58 - the middle schools that have chess
81:00 - programs and not like high schools and
81:03 - not middle schools below a certain grade
81:04 - level and not middle schools that are
81:06 - like religious or not middle schools
81:08 - that don't offer chess programs so I had
81:10 - to filter all this on certain criteria
81:12 - because what I was doing initially was
81:14 - like I would go to Google make a call go
81:16 - to Google type in like a library name um
81:20 - get their number put it in my Excel
81:22 - sheet then I would go to another Google
81:24 - like I would Google another a Library
81:26 - address or a school address and I would
81:30 - put that in my Excel sheet take their
81:31 - phone number put in my Excel sheet and
81:33 - what I was finding out that it was
81:35 - taking
81:36 - me like forever to get that done I was
81:40 - like wow this really sucks like there
81:42 - must be a better way another
81:44 - student good job you guys 3 hours left
81:47 - you guys are you guys are decision maker
81:50 - no my YouTube live stream just died I
81:52 - need need
82:00 - this damn
82:05 - it wow that just made me really
82:11 - sad come on you
82:16 - phone all right anybody want to remind
82:19 - me what I was talking about because I
82:20 - kind of
82:21 - forgot
82:28 - all
82:31 - right Sean
82:34 - says I signed up for a python course
82:36 - yesterday on udem me for $10 to be blunt
82:39 - what does your course offer for
82:43 - $97 how could you charge $97 for your
82:46 - course let me go step by step you build
82:50 - apps in less than 7even days step by
82:53 - step from scratch you're not dependent
82:55 - on looking at your screen your brain
82:57 - going blank by looking at a blank screen
83:00 - you get the tools to build those apps by
83:03 - yourself you're not following just my
83:05 - tutorials and then without me you're
83:07 - screwed the whole idea is to give you
83:09 - these tools so you can build everything
83:12 - you know by yourself as soon as you
83:13 - learn it from me you're able to apply it
83:15 - and do things with it on your own and
83:17 - deviate and go play with your own
83:19 - examples hard to do with some of these
83:22 - online courses that kind of give you
83:24 - this giant thing that you can't do
83:26 - anything about now something more okay
83:29 - than UD me course you get a private
83:31 - community of other like-minded students
83:33 - who are very driven serious dedicated
83:35 - and want to either you know improve
83:37 - their in their career or you can work
83:39 - with them to build a personalized
83:41 - project you can work with them to go and
83:43 - find a new job you can work with them to
83:45 - book new clients you can work with them
83:47 - to start your own freaking business and
83:49 - website that's what I would do if I got
83:52 - together with like-minded people who
83:54 - were driven I would talk with them and I
83:56 - would say hey man or hey girl let's
83:58 - figure it out let's see if we can start
84:01 - something together it could be a website
84:03 - it could be a business we could go book
84:04 - clients we can charge them for certain
84:06 - thing we can build an app together you
84:09 - get that in my course you don't get that
84:10 - at udem me you know what else you get at
84:12 - this course live sessions with everybody
84:15 - so all of you guys are there at least
84:16 - once a month we're sitting in front of
84:18 - each other you guys get to have a mic
84:21 - mic and a camera camera you guys get to
84:23 - talk with everybody you guys get to talk
84:25 - with
84:26 - me that you don't get at uh unim right
84:32 - um what else you get emails from me

84:38 - don't get that at em me okay
84:43 - um projects exercises quizzes you get a
84:47 - little bit of that udemy oh here's
84:49 - another thing boring courses on udemy
84:52 - I'm sorry I'm just going to say it
84:54 - boring like screencasts and they're just
84:56 - deathly boring I can't do it like I
84:59 - can't do it um it's so hard for me to go
85:02 - through those courses honestly so yeah
85:06 - you don't have those these are made with
85:07 - heart these are made with love I take a
85:10 - lot of time to craft them and make them
85:13 - so when you guys get something it's
85:14 - truly the best because again 99% of my
85:18 - material is
85:19 - free I I me I just would wouldn't charge
85:23 - if it actually literally wasn't worth
85:25 - your money or your time because I'm not
85:27 - here to waste your time and like I've
85:28 - said I value your guys' time actually
85:31 - more than
85:34 - mine hopefully that answers your uh
85:51 - question
86:00 - coding is similar to math in that almost
86:03 - nobody just naturally picks it up easily
86:06 - I had to start with Elementary algebra
86:08 - in college worked up to B+ in calculus
86:12 - because I really wanted to learn
86:21 - it
86:26 - sorry guys one
86:28 - second um Nick cook just joined Nick
86:33 - cook
86:38 - welcome
86:40 - Rashad
86:42 - ROK just joined welcome if you're here
86:47 - hit me
86:51 - back
86:53 - yep you're welcome Sean um I love that
86:56 - question and you know you're right you
86:58 - have to be blunt and ask the hard
87:00 - questions and those are the questions a
87:02 - lot of people are uh afraid to ask or
87:05 - even to answer so I'm glad that you took
87:09 - that initiative to an ask that question
87:11 - love
87:11 - it how did clever programmer start
87:16 - um long story I'll make it
87:19 - short last year I was going to UIC
87:23 - had this thought of starting this
87:25 - channel um and my routine looked like
87:27 - this every day I would wake up at 5:30
87:30 - a.m. exactly I'm not a morning person I
87:33 - changed that through listening to books
87:35 - a book was called 21 sleeping
87:39 - strategies for
87:41 - healthier 21 smart sleeping I don't know
87:44 - it's like long L but it was like 21
87:45 - something sleeping strategies and um he
87:49 - just talks about how good it is to sleep
87:51 - at 10: p.m. you know you know you get in
87:52 - that circadian rhythm cycle gets your
87:54 - blood flowing better it gets your mind
87:56 - right it gets your energy up uh you can
87:59 - lift better in the morning your appetite
88:01 - is better so then that way you can eat
88:03 - more um your vitamin D levels remain
88:08 - high and just overall your productivity
88:12 - levels go through the roof and it was
88:13 - true that happened with me so I would
88:15 - sleep at 10 p.m wake up at 5:30 a.m.
88:17 - because that's like I think we I would
88:19 - do four to five sleeping Cycles cuz
88:21 - every sleeping cycle 1 and a half hour
88:22 - so I would sleep 10 wake up at 5:30
88:27 - sharp I would um I had everything timed
88:31 - like I would visualize my day the night
88:33 - before and I would do everything step by
88:35 - step like I I would write it down in my
88:37 - Wonder list like get out of bed at 5:30
88:41 - uh about 5:30 a.m. um get out of the
88:45 - basement and step onto the first floor
88:48 - at 5:37 a.m. get into the shower at like
88:52 - 5:45
88:54 - a.m. get out of the shower at 6:00 a.m.
88:57 - get uh get done eating breakfast at 6:30
89:00 - a.m. 6:20 a.m. by like what you can
89:04 - measure you can
89:05 - change okay it's really important write
89:07 - it down what you can what you can
89:10 - measure you can change okay so by
89:14 - measuring this what was happening was I
89:16 - was getting very efficient and mindful
89:17 - of everything uh because sometimes
89:19 - you'll realize you'll be taking a shower
89:21 - and you'll just take 2 hours for no
89:23 - reason or you'll like be talking to
89:25 - somebody and you'll just take 50 minutes
89:27 - talking and by letting that time leak
89:30 - that's what happens where at the end of
89:31 - the day you're like I'm just so busy and
89:34 - then you look back at your day and
89:35 - you're like I went to a job and then
89:38 - that was it so why am I so drained and
89:40 - why am I so like why can't I do anything
89:43 - so again 5:30 a.m. I would wake up I
89:46 - would like you know read read a book in
89:48 - the morning I would go to the gym I
89:51 - would get done lifting I would get to
89:52 - the go to the train in the train I would
89:54 - read books and then I would go to
89:57 - college I would go to work and then any
89:59 - time I got which was very little I would
90:02 - have my day planned and I would just
90:03 - produce videos like I had planned okay
90:06 - so I would just do that every time just
90:09 - did it for many months
90:12 - consistently
90:15 - non-stop I was like a little Annoying
90:17 - with how crazy I was about it right with
90:19 - that system and then just got pretty
90:22 - good results so that's kind of you know
90:25 - how it went not every day was perfect
90:26 - not every day I slept at 10:00 or woke
90:28 - up at 5:30 like you know it changes but
90:31 - my main priorities were like I have to
90:33 - get this done and I would just try to
90:35 - get that thing done like YouTube video
90:37 - every single time and then it started
90:41 - picking up you know you guys paid
90:43 - attention you guys enjoyed it and uh you
90:47 - guys brought your boy on deck and made
90:50 - this a reality
90:53 - okay my why is my phone so stupid it's
90:55 - just
90:58 - dead all right I yeah I was also
91:01 - answering your question I'm very sneaky
91:04 - with no I mean I'm not sneaky but I just
91:06 - you know brain works weird it's slow but
91:09 - once I'm in I'm like I catch everything
91:12 - so I saw your question and I wanted to
91:14 - uh you know kind of answer that too all
91:17 - right Kitty peace out good
91:20 - night
91:24 - if you want to start a YouTube
91:26 - channel start it like it doesn't it's
91:29 - not any you know extra extra work or
91:33 - whatever you can just kind of get
91:35 - started um it just takes effort and it
91:39 - just takes time like that's what it is
91:41 - it's most people get discouraged without
91:43 - seeing results and one of my extreme
91:48 - skills is that
91:50 - I
91:54 - I'm very crazy about implications of
91:56 - things so like when I see when I saw 20
92:01 - cents when I was doing Bitcoin mining I
92:03 - was like if I scale this that's like
92:06 - thousands of dollars and most people
92:08 - can't see that like most people just see
92:10 - this this this computer just sitting
92:11 - here making 20 cents what the hell can I
92:13 - do with 20 cents but what they're not
92:15 - thinking is like this computer is
92:16 - sitting
92:18 - here literally nobody's doing anything
92:20 - extra and it's just generating
92:23 - money now what if I scaled it and what
92:27 - if to increase my profit margin I found
92:29 - out ways where the electricity cost was
92:32 - lower or the maintenance cost was lower
92:35 - what if I could like host it in a cloud
92:37 - what if what if I could like get a
92:39 - service now it's scalable right but
92:43 - people don't really people see the first
92:44 - thing and then they're kind of stop and
92:46 - that's what happened and that's what
92:48 - kept me going right so when I would see
92:51 - one subscri subscriber every day I was
92:54 - like Wow before there was Zero
92:56 - subscribers now it's one subscriber
92:57 - every day I mean so I and I also make my
93:01 - goals really small every time like sure
93:03 - I want to be at the level where I have
93:06 - six packs but if your goal is that
93:08 - you'll quit the next day so what your
93:10 - goal has to be is a little bit different
93:11 - for example when you go to the gym your
93:13 - goal should just be hey I'm going to
93:14 - increase uh incrementally so uh 2 and2
93:18 - lbs extra on each side so 5 lbs I'm
93:20 - going to increase my S on my deadlift
93:22 - I'm going to put 10 lb extra on my bench
93:25 - I'm going to put this many pounds extra
93:26 - right and then you get your form right
93:29 - you get your squat you know you got your
93:31 - squat right you focus on the little
93:34 - goals in between you trick your mind you
93:37 - make those goals really important but
93:40 - the whole time you're actually going
93:41 - towards that bigger goal but you don't
93:42 - let your mind think about that because
93:44 - your mind is very easily tricked it just
93:46 - goes oh but the six-pack but I don't
93:48 - have it and I just quit so you have that
93:51 - that long goal in your head you tell
93:53 - your brain to shut up you set these
93:56 - middle and small goals and then you
93:59 - follow them and you enjoy those goals
94:02 - and you make make goals that are all
94:04 - follow like deliverable actionable right
94:07 - like your goal shouldn't
94:09 - be how can I start a $2 million
94:14 - business I'll go to like a vcn pitch
94:17 - you're going to you're just you're
94:19 - setting yourself up for failure
94:22 - how about how can I do something where
94:24 - people pay me 5
94:25 - cents okay now how can I take it to 10
94:28 - cents and how can I take you 20 cents
94:31 - scale it systematically improve it test
94:34 - it ask somebody to pay you $10 and then
94:37 - go hm I just went from 50 cents to $10
94:39 - by just asking or if they say no you're
94:42 - like hm maybe I can go
94:43 - lower so you know a lot of these things
94:46 - are very systematic have these small
94:48 - goals that you set up and then follow
94:50 - them through you'll get to your ultimate
94:53 - goal but you won't get to your ultimate
94:54 - goal if that's the only thing you're
94:56 - following cuz you don't have any little
94:57 - motivational snacks in
94:59 - between the the motivational snacks that
95:02 - should actually be a
95:05 - quote
95:15 - um okay so let's see mwanza just

99:41 - be looking for even more serious

101:15 - C++ course for
101:17 - free cs50 pretty damn good it's C uh but
101:23 - once you learn C you learn everything
101:24 - C++ too so when I was learning it cuz I
101:27 - wanted to learn C at some point or and
101:29 - or C++ sorry and I was like there were
101:32 - there are no good courses for C++ that
101:34 - kind of sucks so I learned C and then
101:39 - yeah it's C++ is not much different I
101:41 - just picked it up pretty
101:45 - fast nice sahad

102:07 - right
102:19 - back

103:36 - all right guys I will be right
103:41 - back I will get some more Diet Coke for
103:44 - you

106:49 - e
107:49 - e
108:19 - e
109:19 - e
109:49 - for
110:19 - e
110:43 - [Music]
110:46 - what
110:49 - hello
111:00 - hey guys what's
111:07 - up welcome
111:12 - back hey
111:17 - Matias okay Matias so let me answer your
111:19 - question he says I was going to sign up
111:23 - but then I found out I have to pay an
111:25 - extra
111:27 - $46 and it's actually not 46 it's
111:30 - $47 you have to pay extra or something
111:33 - for full access Community which was a
111:35 - bit disappointing so Matas was
111:37 - disappointed because he had to pay more
111:40 - let me put it this way this should not
111:43 - be $47 for onetime payment it should
111:46 - actually be $47 a
111:48 - month because that's the kind of
111:50 - community you guys have so if you get
111:53 - this community for extra
111:55 - $47 and you can even I don't know land a
111:59 - job where you can work for $50 an hour
112:02 - that's like one hour of your time and
112:04 - you make it back so yeah it's a little
112:07 - bit more expensive but there was a
112:09 - deadline that I announced to everybody
112:11 - on my email and I told everybody that I
112:15 - think it was on Tuesday the cut off time
112:17 - was Tuesday at 8:00 p.m. the slack
112:20 - channel uh is actually not part of the
112:22 - course you have to pay an extra 47 to
112:24 - join it so that's really you know where
112:29 - I'm at with that so hopefully that
112:31 - answers your question but I honestly
112:33 - think it's a steal it's a good
112:34 - investment in yourself but hey look if
112:36 - you're not ready or willing to uh go
112:38 - that route right now that's okay um you
112:42 - still will have access to me you'll
112:44 - we'll still have live sessions live
112:45 - webinars right uh we'll still be adding
112:48 - more and more content to this course so
112:50 - keep in mind you're ping $97 right now
112:52 - for potentially a course that's going to
112:53 - be two three four $500 maybe even
112:58 - more so right now you lock it in at the
113:00 - current price if I add future content
113:03 - it's yours to keep if I add new videos
113:06 - they're yours if I have new live webinar
113:08 - and sessions they're yours you want to
113:11 - collaborate with other students sure
113:13 - okay all at the price of $97 thankful is
113:17 - $500 a month College course is $1,500 a
113:21 - month and you don't learn nearly enough
113:23 - the people you're working with at in the
113:25 - class are all confused They Don't Really
113:27 - Care they're not even interested they
113:29 - don't even know what career they want to
113:30 - get into they just happen to be doing
113:32 - programming and you're mixing a crowd of
113:34 - everybody this community is like people
113:37 - who are dedicated to really advance and
113:39 - take themselves to the next level if I
113:41 - put some barriers in front it makes it
113:43 - even a better Community when you guys
113:45 - join because everybody who's in here is
113:48 - making a commitment they're saying we're
113:50 - making an investment they're not here to
113:51 - waste your time you're not here to waste
113:53 - theirs you're really both there to hold
113:56 - each other accountable move
113:58 - forward uh how many have already paid
114:00 - for the community let me tell
114:06 - you
114:09 - 98 just joined uh it's actually more
114:12 - people that have paid for the community
114:14 - some people haven't even joined the
114:16 - community yet uh their enrollments are
114:19 - actually on pause so it's going to be
114:21 - probably 110 115 people in the community
114:24 - it's going to be more here I'll just
114:26 - send you a screen in screenshot of the
114:28 - community so you can see kind of uh what
114:31 - it looks like in here and uh what's
114:34 - going
114:44 - on all right I just took this screenshot
114:47 - right now slack community
114:50 - Community okay take a look at
114:53 - it you'll see that people are posting
114:55 - their code other people are commenting
114:59 - um we'll answer your questions
115:01 - everybody's collaborating with each
115:02 - other so on the left hand side you'll
115:04 - see something called direct messages
115:06 - everybody's able to directly message so
115:08 - you can one-on-one communicate with
115:10 - everybody or you can actually just be in
115:11 - one of our channels and then communicate
115:14 - with everybody else that way so it's a
115:16 - pretty transparent Community we over 100
115:18 - students in like
115:21 - literally by the way um in the last like
115:25 - three days we had over hundreds of
115:27 - students joined our program so you know
115:30 - uh everybody's excited everybody's
115:32 - coming on board uh and they're having
115:34 - fun and I'm you know I just sent you a
115:35 - screenshot of it so take a look at
115:41 - it Matas you have a lot of
115:45 - questions um look if you're not ready
115:48 - that is totally okay again I will answer
115:51 - some of your um you have to take that
115:54 - link Matas and copy and paste it in a
115:57 - URL okay that's how you'll see this
116:02 - link you don't want to pay for it and be
116:04 - there alone you're not alone again I
116:06 - just said you have over a 100 students
116:08 - in
116:09 - there IPL you're not too late to the
116:12 - stream basically the course is closing
116:14 - down two hours left to make the deadline
116:17 - so if you guys are new here you have two
116:19 - hours left to make the deadline in short
116:22 - way what's offered in the course is
116:24 - again stepbystep instructions for you to
116:27 - be able to go from code to making your
116:29 - apps from scratch in Python okay
116:32 - something you can show employers
116:33 - something that you can actually put on
116:36 - your portfolio and charge clients a
116:38 - higher price for uh you'll Master the
116:40 - fundamentals of object-oriented
116:42 - programming so guy graphical user
116:43 - interfac is what you see in front of you
116:45 - click click click everything right
116:48 - otherwise we would be back in 1970s so
116:50 - you'll have that you'll have a live
116:52 - one-on-one Master call with me for 15
116:55 - minutes where we discuss your strategy
116:58 - for the next two to three months we lay
117:00 - down a road map of what you're going to
117:02 - be doing for the next X amount of months
117:04 - so then that way you're very clear with
117:07 - what your priorities are okay so again I
117:10 - think that's pretty valuable and it
117:11 - might be really valuable for
117:14 - you we have live uh sessions so they're
117:18 - called live accelerat hacking sessions
117:20 - where we get together at least once a
117:22 - month and we all connect and we do
117:25 - either coding challenges or like a live
117:27 - uh you know Mack interview or Q&A so
117:30 - questions and answers so you'll get to
117:32 - be part of that you'll get uh emails
117:35 - where I'll send you extra videos or
117:37 - extra uh you know resources and guides
117:40 - you'll have weekly check-ins every
117:42 - Monday I'll check in with you I'm going
117:44 - to send out surveys get your guys' uh
117:47 - questions you know I'll email you them
117:48 - and I'll get your guys' opinions on
117:50 - things and suggestions and we'll tweak
117:52 - the course to that that's why it's a 30
117:55 - to 60 day Sprint so you guys are going
117:58 - to be actually I'm inviting you guys to
118:00 - this so then we can really take this
118:02 - course to the next level together okay
118:03 - so that's really what's going on here uh
118:06 - the link is in the description of this
118:17 - video um oh I sent you the link at the
118:20 - top uh HTTP d.
118:23 - PRI SLX rt4 so I'll put that at the
118:28 - bottom
118:29 - again that's the
118:33 - link okay so uh here's what I'm going to
118:37 - be
118:38 - doing um I'm going to go offline in a
118:44 - little bit and then I'm sure you guys
118:46 - will have a ton of questions you know in
118:48 - the last hour stretch cuz right now you
118:50 - guys have 2 hours and 25 minutes to
118:52 - decide go to the page learn more about
118:55 - the course understand that this is a
118:57 - no-brainer with a 30-day money back
118:59 - guarantee you call me I refund you no
119:02 - questions asked I'm not here to nickel
119:03 - and dime you not here to do whatever
119:05 - right but I want but you have
119:08 - responsibility in this course like I
119:10 - want you to actually take I want you to
119:12 - be involved in this course I want you to
119:14 - actually put in work this is not some
119:17 - again magic course we just going to take
119:19 - it and somehow you're going to get
119:20 - better by breathing and watching videos
119:22 - you're going to get better by watching
119:23 - videos but you're going to get a lot
119:25 - better when you actually take the uh you
119:28 - know the like the assignments that are
119:31 - given to you and what you're expected to
119:32 - do once you put in that work you're
119:34 - going to see you're going to be putting
119:36 - in two times of work as usual and you're
119:38 - going to be getting 10 times of results
119:40 - right that's really what I'm trying to
119:42 - do here I'm taking lots of
119:44 - other cor uh you know corsera online
119:49 - mukes and all of that and really making
119:51 - this uh as a best resource that has
119:53 - those things outlined I think in the
119:55 - best
119:59 - way yeah yeah uh IPL great question
120:03 - that's exactly where actually all of
120:04 - these courses are headed right now
120:06 - you're going to make local desktop
120:08 - applications with python and then
120:09 - eventually and the reason is so you
120:11 - don't you don't deal with any of the
120:12 - online complexity cuz when you combine
120:15 - online with an app that makes things
120:17 - very complicated so what we're going to
120:19 - be doing is we're going to only build
120:21 - something local with python we're going
120:24 - to build multiple apps you actually get
120:26 - ideas how it actually works and then I'm
120:29 - going to show you uh how to take it
120:31 - online so then you're not getting
120:35 - confused between connecting those two
120:37 - parts together you'll understand how to
120:39 - develop an app and then you'll
120:41 - understand how to bring it online and
120:43 - all you have to do is just connect the
120:44 - two and then boom your flask app or your
120:48 - Django app is up and running so
120:52 - yeah yeah Jan Tapper I'm sorry quality
120:55 - is definitely better than this morning
120:57 - the webinar that you are at um but yes
121:00 - the sound is not
121:03 - synchronized okay guys so I wanted to
121:06 - answer your questions I wanted to answer
121:08 - your concerns because I understand it's
121:11 - an investment in yourself but that's
121:13 - truly the idea to take this and get that
121:16 - return on your investment immediately
121:17 - because I don't want you to be thinking
121:19 - oh man like I need to really if you're
121:21 - tied up on money don't you know I don't
121:24 - want you to be worrying about that when
121:26 - you invest in this course because you'll
121:27 - not focus on learn you're not you won't
121:29 - be able to focus on learning but that's
121:31 - why I give you so many tools to earn
121:32 - your money back and 10 times more is
121:35 - because then when you actually are in
121:38 - the course you're able to just learn and
121:41 - focus on it and you don't have to worry
121:43 - about anything else because you're
121:45 - already you got your return on your
121:47 - investment you're not like I invested in
121:49 - here do I get anything back do I not get
121:51 - anything back okay so it's really to so
121:53 - you don't have to worry about
122:03 - that my website is not on WordPress my
122:06 - chest tasc.com website was on WordPress
122:10 - because I was not a developer back
122:14 - then and because I realized that I had
122:17 - to use Excel sheets to do everything I
122:20 - realized there had I figured there had
122:22 - to be a better way I ended up hiring a
122:24 - programmer paid him $500 to write a
122:26 - simple script which I'll show you guys
122:29 - in my course to write and you guys will
122:31 - learn it and uh you won't have to pay
122:33 - 500 bucks for it I did because it was
122:36 - helping me with my business at the time
122:38 - and using that script we were able to
122:40 - pull all of the schools middle schools
122:44 - uh that I could actually based on a
122:46 - certain criteria that I could call and
122:50 - book my uh chess sessions with them so
122:53 - because I I had a company for chess
122:56 - tastic and we would you know put our
122:58 - programs in their schools and we would
123:01 - put our programs in their uh libraries
123:04 - as
123:06 - well okay guys so that's it for now we
123:10 - already had a really long session we're
123:12 - at 2 hours and 2 minutes I'm going to
123:14 - let you guys go and I'm going to come
123:18 - back when you guys have one hour left
123:19 - cuz I'm pretty sure you guys going to
123:21 - have ton of questions the link is still
123:23 - here you guys can click that link to
123:25 - check out the course um I think you're
123:28 - going to really enjoy this course
123:29 - there's just a ton of content that's not
123:31 - covered in courses like Linda udem me
123:34 - corsera whatever else right you have
123:36 - that Community you have those live
123:38 - sessions you have uh all these exercises
123:41 - you you have all this accountability
123:43 - people to network with you get those
123:45 - emails to hold you accountable you get
123:47 - those weekly check-ins like those things
123:50 - are not offered at all those other
123:51 - places and again thinkful which doesn't
123:54 - even offer all of those things is $500 a
123:56 - month and then other programming boot
123:58 - camps like full stack Academy is
124:01 - $155,000 uh for three months then you
124:04 - have um you know C Udacity courses where
124:08 - you only get feedback and that's $200 a
124:11 - month so really a lot of these options
124:14 - are uh pretty expensive and they still
124:18 - don't give you you all of the stuff
124:20 - that's offered okay so I really want to
124:22 - make this a no-brainer for you guys make
124:24 - it really easy and simple uh but yeah
124:27 - again I'll
124:31 - come I'll uh join Nathan I'm going to be
124:34 - adding new stuff to the Course once it's
