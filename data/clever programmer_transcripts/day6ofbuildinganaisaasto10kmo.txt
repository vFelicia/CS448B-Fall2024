00:04 - month my co-founder Nas and I decided to

00:12 - behind our home family friends and even
00:14 - our relationships first things first
00:17 - it's time to settle into our new home
00:20 - but we realized we got a big problem we
00:23 - found out that our Visions aren't fully
00:26 - aligned Kazi wants to focus 100% on the
00:29 - sasay tool but me I want to still Focus
00:33 - 8 20% on my current business and 80% on
00:37 - the SAS AI to I think that's fair my
00:40 - problem isn't fairness mhm what I'm
00:42 - thinking is what if we got together how
00:45 - much farther would we go and how much
