00:00 - - Hey you!
00:01 - In this video I want to talk about how
00:03 - can you become a self taught developer.
00:07 - This idea came from
00:09 - this recent video I made called,
00:11 - "The Biggest Mistake Programmers Make."
00:13 - On that video, Chris
Hawkes posted a comment
00:16 - and he said,
00:17 - "I'm a self taught developer,"
00:18 - and Chris Hawkes, by the way,
00:19 - also has his own YouTube channel
00:21 - and is teaching lots of people
00:22 - which is super cool.
00:23 - And he goes, "I'm a self taught
developer and I've taught
00:25 - probably millions at this point.
00:27 - I've never used video
tutorials for learning.
00:29 - I think you have to get out of the books,
00:31 - tutorials, your own head
00:33 - and just start writing code."
00:35 - So, I'm gonna talk
about how you can become
00:37 - a self taught developer; my
thoughts on that comment.
00:40 - So without any further ado,
00:42 - lets jump
00:43 - right into it.
00:44 - I've always wanted to put my own ad
00:46 - at the start of my video
and at the end of my video.
00:49 - So this is going to be super awesome.
00:50 - But I have a special announcement
00:52 - and I do wanna say this.
00:53 - I've been planning to put this together
00:55 - for a really long time.
00:56 - It's finally come together
00:57 - and it's an unbelievable program.
00:59 - I'm gonna talk more about it at the end.
01:00 - I have something very special for you.
01:02 - Okay.
01:03 - If you've ever wanted to make your first
01:05 - $1,000 from programming, coding.
01:07 - Alright.
01:08 - If you ever wanted to
learn how you can freelance
01:10 - and start earning an income from this.
01:12 - If you ever wanted to learn
01:13 - how you could 10x your productivity,
01:15 - learn the tools, strategies and frameworks
01:17 - to take your skills to the next level,
01:20 - and
01:20 - learn how to freelance with it,
01:22 - learn how to have more time,
money, impact, on this world.
01:26 - Okay.
01:27 - If wanted to be able to
do all of those things,
01:29 - well, I have a thing for you.
01:31 - I'm gonna put that at
the end of this video.
01:33 - Enjoy this video.
01:34 - You're gonna love it.
01:34 - And at the end I'm going to show you
01:36 - what are the steps you need to take
01:38 - to jump on this thing.
01:39 - Lets do this!
01:40 - Alright, this is Qazi,
also know as Papa Python
01:43 - from cleverprogrammer.com.
01:46 - It helps a lot if you're
watching this video.
01:49 - If you could just hit the like button,
01:51 - it helps out the channel a lot.
01:52 - I'm trying to be as active as possible.
01:54 - This is day 11 of the coding challenge
01:58 - that I am doing.
01:59 - So this is video 11 out of 30.
02:01 - And if you wanna follow
me along on this journey
02:03 - of where I'm doing a
video every single day,
02:07 - you can follow me along
02:08 - and say, code for 10
minutes or 30 minutes a day.
02:11 - Could be something simple like that.
02:12 - And you can follow me at
@cleverqazi on my Instagram
02:15 - to see more of the behind the scenes.
02:18 - And you can also tag me.
02:19 - Like go, "Hey @cleverqazi"
02:21 - and then like, "hashtag 30 day challenge"
02:23 - and I'll repost you,
02:24 - so that way we can keep
each other accountable.
02:26 - It's not so much as to grow my Instagram.
02:28 - Which, you know, it's helping
when you guys jump on.
02:31 - But what I've realized is
02:32 - Instagram is really
02:33 - this amazing habit building tool
02:35 - that I use for myself.
02:36 - So I want to inspire other
people to use it as well.
02:39 - Like you can see I'm tracking my jam,
02:40 - I'm tracking my daily log,
02:42 - I'm tracking my videos
02:44 - and if I code I'll even track that too.
02:46 - Alright so moving on.
02:48 - Let's talk about what--
02:50 - how you can become
02:51 - a self taught developer
02:52 - and my thoughts on Chris Hawkes's comment.
02:54 - So basically, Chris Hawkes is saying,
02:56 - "like yo, you have to
stop looking at tutorials,
03:00 - and books and relying on something."
03:03 - This goes pretty much hand in hand
03:04 - with the last video that I made
03:07 - where somebody commented on the video
03:09 - and was like, "yeah, if I wanna write
03:11 - 500 lines of code, you know I can build
03:14 - a calculator app.
03:15 - And I know a lot of C and C plus plus
03:17 - but if it comes to
making sorting algorithms
03:19 - or something like that
03:20 - or I have to write 500 lines of code."
03:22 - He's so proud of himself and he's like,
03:23 - "nah, I can't do that.
03:26 - I'll wait till I get those courses."
03:28 - So I am against that
03:29 - and Chris Hawkes, it seems like,
03:31 - is also a little bit against that concept.
03:33 - What Chris is encouraging people to do is,
03:37 - yo, get off your ass
03:38 - yo, get off your ass
03:39 - and start actually working on a project
03:42 - or your own coding thing.
03:43 - Because tutorials are going to help you
03:45 - but they're not gonna help you
03:46 - make the things that you wanna make.
03:48 - And as you're building the
project that you're building
03:50 - then you can actually go back
03:51 - and look up those certain things.
03:53 - So then if you get stuck on-
03:55 - Let's say your app needs to have some kind
03:56 - of sorting algorithm to show people
03:59 - based on their like--
04:00 - In alphabetical order
04:01 - or it needs to show people
04:02 - based on their like, follower accounts.
04:04 - So you know, if you're
making a Twitter clone
04:06 - or an Instagram clone and you wanna have
04:08 - like a leader board of who
has the most followers,
04:10 - then you need some kind
of like sorting algorithm
04:12 - and that's a very basic one, right?
04:14 - So then you can still go
and learn that tutorial.
04:17 - As soon as you learn it
you can come and apply it.
04:19 - That's how each concept
is gonna be internalized.
04:22 - It's gonna be beyond just this superficial
04:23 - It's gonna be beyond just this superficial
04:26 - level of understanding.
04:27 - And I know in the last few videos
04:28 - I've been hammering this point home.
04:31 - There's a reason because
it's that important.
04:34 - If you wanna become a
self taught developer,
04:36 - the terrible way of doing it
04:38 - is just hoping you can keep learning,
04:40 - and learning, and learning,
and learning, and learning
04:42 - and then one day you dream
04:43 - you're gonna be ready for something.
04:44 - Right?
04:45 - Let me challenge you to something.
04:46 - How many of your own projects
have you built so far?
04:49 - If your answer is like,
very few, less than say
04:52 - five or three,
04:54 - like of your own projects,
04:55 - there's a reason why you're not improving
04:57 - at the level you wanna improve at.
04:58 - There's a reason why you might be stuck
05:00 - where you're stuck.
05:01 - There's a reason why you feel like
05:02 - you see tutorial after tutorial
05:04 - but you're not really understanding it.
05:06 - And there's a reason why you feel
05:07 - that lack of confidence
05:08 - or that you're not earning
an income from coding
05:10 - or becoming a freelancer
05:12 - or a self taught developer.
05:13 - Now,
05:14 - if you start building your own projects
05:16 - and you learn as you go and you take away
05:18 - that fear of the unknown
05:19 - and stop waiting to just
learn all this crap;
05:21 - now you're gonna be in a
really amazing position,
05:24 - my friend.
05:25 - And you're gonna be learning
faster than you ever have
05:27 - and you're gonna internalize
all the information,
05:29 - be able to apply it to
your projects and that way
05:31 - you're not wasting any time.
05:33 - Because most of our time
is wasted, honestly,
05:35 - learning lots of tutorials,
going through lots of books
05:38 - but not applying it.
05:39 - How I can relate this to chess is,
05:40 - I had this really good friend,
05:42 - his name is Adil.
05:43 - I love that guy.
05:44 - But what he would do a lot is..
05:47 - he would intimidate me with his knowledge
05:49 - of like, chess.
05:49 - of like, chess.
05:50 - Okay.
05:51 - So he'd be like, "hey, I
learned Sicilian Accelerated
05:53 - Hyper Modern Dragon
05:55 - and in this book that I'm going through,
05:57 - I'm learning the endgames by Dvoretsky
05:59 - and I'm learning this stuff.
06:01 - And I'm going through
06:02 - 'Reassess Your Chess' by Jeremy Silman."
06:04 - And I'm like, what the hell's going on?
06:06 - You know.
06:07 - I'm like, this guy
knows way too much stuff
06:08 - but I was playing more
chess games than him.
06:10 - I was going to more
tournaments actively than him.
06:13 - What ended up happening?
06:15 - My rating actually
improved faster than him.
06:18 - And I love him to death.
06:19 - He was actually in California.
06:21 - Right now I'm in Miami on a beach
06:23 - which is pretty cool but I
was in California in L.A.
06:25 - and he came there and
we were on a jet ski.
06:27 - So I still love him.
06:28 - He's still one of my best friends but
06:30 - when it came to chess I
was able to improve faster
06:33 - and the reason why that
happened was because
06:35 - I was playing more actively.
06:37 - Okay.
06:38 - So he knew all this theory and knowledge
06:40 - but I actually had a stronger rating.
06:43 - Right.
06:44 - But then he applied himself to the gym
06:46 - and I was learning more theory there
06:48 - and he's way stronger.
06:50 - His squat is like 300 pounds
06:51 - and my one rep max is like, you know,
06:53 - 215 pounds.
06:55 - Now coming back to
coding, the coding world.
06:58 - If you are just learning
and learning theory
07:01 - and going to tutorials
and learning recursion,
07:04 - going through books but you're not working
07:05 - on your own projects,
it's really unfortunate
07:07 - but you're gonna kinda suck.
07:09 - You're gonna be able to be in a room
07:10 - and hold a conversation.
07:12 - You're gonna sound and feel smart.
07:14 - You're gonna feel like
you can judge other people
07:16 - But probably not gonna have a job.
07:18 - You're probably not gonna
have an awesome portfolio.
07:21 - You're probably not gonna have a lot of
07:22 - projects to show for it.
07:24 - And, you're actually gonna have
07:25 - a much weaker skill set.
07:27 - So unless that knowledge is applied
07:29 - it's useless.
07:30 - But if you wanna become better at soccer
07:32 - and I just started teaching
you on a white board
07:34 - and I'm like,
07:35 - so this how you kick and
this is the best way to kick
07:38 - and theoretically if you
kick at a 45 degree angle
07:40 - this shit's gonna get lit.
07:42 - That's not gonna help you
and you're not gonna improve.
07:44 - Right.
07:45 - But the way that you are gonna improve
07:47 - is if you actually go and
just play with your friends,
07:50 - fuck up a lot, make a lot of mistakes,
07:52 - and then look up something.
07:54 - Right.
07:55 - And then look up, okay, how
can I improve my passing
07:58 - or how can I impr--
07:59 - Then you're gonna get a lot better.
08:01 - So this is my message for you.
08:03 - Shout out to Chris Hawkes for
08:04 - commenting on the channel.
08:05 - Thank you for that
awesome thing and support.
08:07 - Thank you everybody else
who's on this channel
08:09 - and supporting it.
08:11 - At this point, I love your
face off but I do wanna say,
08:15 - in the comments below let
me know what you think
08:19 - about becoming a self taught developer.
08:21 - I'm jumping in and responding to almost
08:23 - every single person right now.
08:24 - I'm very active.
08:25 - So if you wanna jump in
and ask me a question,
08:27 - you know,
08:28 - just something for what
people are consulting with me.
08:29 - They're paying me $500 an hour or more.
08:31 - So if you jump in and ask me questions
08:33 - I'll be more than happy
to actually answer.
08:35 - And you'll have me, you
know, one on one there.
08:37 - So jump in and tell me your thoughts
08:38 - on becoming a self taught developer.
08:40 - It's okay if you disagree with me.
08:42 - Doesn't matter.
08:43 - But jump in, drop something,
give me your thoughts
08:45 - on this video or becoming
a self taught developer.
08:48 - Other than that, thank
you so much for watching.
08:50 - I love your face!
08:50 - And as always,
08:52 - I'll see you
08:52 - I'll see you
08:53 - in the next video!
08:55 - So I have launched my new program called,
08:58 - "Earn 1K With Python."
09:00 - This is a brand new program.
09:01 - I've had so many students tell me,
09:03 - "Qazi, please make
something that is awesome,
09:06 - that's something we can afford,
09:08 - and something that most of the students
09:09 - can have and get started with.
09:11 - Something that's more towards beginners
09:13 - and also people who wanna
get their first step
09:16 - and make their first
$1,000 from programming.
09:18 - Because there are a lot
of programmers I know
09:21 - who are pretty damn good
09:22 - but they still haven't
made their first $1,000.
09:24 - And they don't know
what's a repeatable system
09:27 - to get high level mentorship,
09:28 - high level job opportunities,
09:30 - internships.
09:31 - How do they get those freelancing deals
09:34 - that most people don't know about
09:36 - but there's a world of
developers that knows about them?
09:39 - Right.
09:39 - Why is there a difference
between broke programmers?
09:41 - Programmers who know a thing or two,
09:43 - who know how they can generate an income
09:46 - from this field.
09:47 - Most programmers are broke
but I wanna show you ways
09:51 - where you can cut down the trial and error
09:54 - because it's the most
expensive way to learn.
09:56 - And I have an incredible video
09:58 - that I want you to go and see
09:59 - that I put together.
10:00 - Okay.
10:01 - This video is unbelievable.
10:02 - This video will show you
10:03 - how I went from being a dumb,
10:05 - broke and a community college student
10:07 - to making $104,000 a year as a developer.
10:10 - I have put together a video for you
10:12 - that will show you not only that
10:14 - but it will show you how you can
10:16 - leverage my hacks,
10:16 - leverage my hacks,
10:18 - my morning routine hacks, my strategies,
10:20 - to essentially supercharge
10:22 - and 10x your productivity
10:23 - and effectiveness as a developer.
10:25 - And this video will also show you
10:27 - how to break past the
barriers of procrastination
10:30 - and build more structure and discipline.
10:32 - Because that's one of the
things that people lack.
10:34 - But most importantly,
this video will show you
10:37 - how you can earn your first, first, first
10:40 - $1,000 from programming and
coding as a Python developer.
10:45 - And this is the biggest barrier
10:47 - and once people cross it,
10:48 - it helps them learn a lot faster,
10:50 - it helps them commit to programming more,
10:52 - it helps them put more hours into it,
10:54 - and it helps them cut many years
10:57 - of taking a lot longer.
10:59 - And it gets them there a lot faster.
11:00 - So that's one of the biggest things
11:02 - that people don't know about.
11:04 - But if you can start earning
an income from coding
11:06 - as fast as possible,
11:07 - you're gonna be in a position--
11:08 - you're gonna be in a pretty
awesome position, alright.
11:10 - So please go watch this video.
11:11 - It's epically put together.
11:13 - Click on the link below in the description
11:16 - and it's gonna take you to it.
11:17 - With that said,
11:18 - thank you so much for watching!
11:19 - As always,
11:20 - I love your face
11:20 - and I'll see you in that other video.
11:23 - So go click there.
11:24 - I'll see you right there.
11:25 - Click there.
11:25 - Do it.
11:26 - Do it.
11:27 - Do it.
11:28 - Ah!
