you you hello everyone thank you so much for joining we will get started here in just a few minutes we're just gonna give some time for everyone to get a chance to hang out with us here you you all right in the chat box if you can please share with us where you're joining us from you great and I see a couple of you have your last names listed here so if you can please you should be able to rename yourself by if you can't find that button don't worry about what it will kind of go from there but try to make sure that you don't have your last name listed here okay we're gonna give just one more minute and then we are gonna kick off and get started if you can see my screen that's as come learn with us please go ahead and raise your hand you great awesome okay in the chat box if you can quickly just tell us what grade you're in you you you awesome so we have some different grade levels joining us here so we appreciate you taking the time okay good and we have a few teachers perfect okay so this is a we're gonna go ahead and get started so this is a come learn with us this is a students guide to learning with code monkey this is a webinar for the younger students but we appreciate teachers joining us as well so we are leaving our chat box open today so I'm some videoconferencing etiquette that we just like to remind our students is always be on time mute yourself so all of you guys are muted unfortunately for this but if you're joining another zoom conference just I'm always make sure to mute yourself and give your so nobody can hear that extra background noise for today's presentation just make sure that you're in a good spot that you're you know you're wearing something that's still appropriate for school although we can't see you today here using headphones so you can be respectful of those around you when you are chatting in the chat box please make sure that you're using appropriate language exactly like you would in the school setting and if you have a question you can pop it into our Q&A box or you can also go ahead and send us a message through the chat and we'll also save some of your questions towards the end so I like to introduce myself first my name is lina saleh and i am the professional development manager here at code monkey I also have taught in the classroom work with many students across the k8 spanha even taught second grade and fourth grade and worked with sixth graders so I look quite a bit of students so if you have any questions or anything feel free to reach out to me here is my contact information I do have two other panelists joining me and you that we don't have a slide for them today but we do have Talia she's joining us from our Israel from Israel and then we have Molly who is joining us from Colorado so we're kind of all over the country just like you guys are and I am from Austin Texas so thank you so I'm just gonna start off first by telling a little bit about code monkey had a code monkey get started so in 2014 our founder Jonathan launched code monkey after working with students um he is a computer scientist and he started working with kids like you and realized that they just didn't really like to learn code coding in the same boring old way so that's how code monkey was born so it's fun it's gamified it's really designed for you to be able to have a lot of fun while you're learning how to cope and we use real programming languages so today we're gonna kind of get kickstarted here so in the chat box I would like for you to rate yourself on a scale of one to three so one being I'm a superb coder I'm kind of in the middle and three I'm not so good yet at coding but I'm on the right track so if you could take a minute really quickly to pop into the chat box a one Rockstar coder in the middle three I'm on my way with still learning oh good I like the 2.5 that's a good one oh hi Thomas thanks for joining us from Columbia you're far away away from me alright good so it looks at me I kind of have an inbetweener here and that's perfect and that's great so today we're gonna be working with our beaver achiever of course it is our blockbased course we won't be working with anything textbased today if you are I saw one of you were in sixth grade you should definitely join us tomorrow for our game builder or webinar all right so we're gonna do an unplugged activity we're work on some coding vocabulary and then we're gonna work with our beaver achiever in the chatbox really quickly of or not in the chat box if you could raise your hand if you have your own log in for code monkey you you okay great so some you do some of you don't and that's perfect I'm just kind of getting a feel for kind of where you guys are so actually today I would like for you to not be logged into your own account if you're a teacher feel free to go ahead and be logged in but if you're a student please make sure that you are logged out of your account and we'll give you a username and password to use for today so that you can have the same ability as everyone else so we can explore some different challenges today all right so the first thing that we're going to do is I'm going to ask you to be interactive in our chat box here today and we are going to do an unplugged activity so we have what we can see here on a grid so I want you to think about the grid as one one movement we have a few of the directions that we can step and our goal here is that we want to get student a to our ball so to do so we can use the following oops the following directions here up step turn right and turn left so I want you to think about when you're turning your body left so we are facing in the same direction currently right now I am as student a I'm facing my white board and I want you to in the directions in the chat box I want you to write out the directions that you think we should take to get student a to the ball and with coding we always face in the direction of which we're moving so I want you to think about that about how that should go so I'm gonna have a couple I'm gonna give you guys a couple of minutes and I want you to tell me what our first step or you can write out the steps in the chat box themselves what step you think we should take first from our code over here on the Left we have step turn right turn left oh okay so everyone is saying we should turn right first that is correct we want to turn right so we can turn the direction in which we so we can face the direction in which we want to walk so now that we're turning in the correct direction what should we do next oh okay I see step I see some people just say a certain just stepping I see some people giving me a number great okay great thank you guys for being so interactive Ian I see that you said step five or will you said Step five Paul you said step four alright so let's go ahead and let's see where we think we should move so those of you that said Step five awesome you guys did a really great job but he said step four there's nothing wrong with that we just would find ourselves just a little bit short of where we want to go so now that we step five what happens next okay I see some really good directions here we are going to we made it we Step five we counted from where we were one two three four and five and now I see that we're gonna turn whoops sorry turn left so that we can that is correct face up or face the direction in which we want to go so Thomas really great job okay and then I see everyone giving me these directions you guys are on it today great and then now we're gonna need to do something so we're gonna have to step if we just count nothing is going to happen so we're gonna have to step whoops and we're gonna step four this time so one two three and four and now we've gotten to the ball so first we turned right then we stepped five and then we turn left and we stepped four so in this case basically what we did here is we created an algorithm so an algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem so anytime that you're kind of creating a plan of action I like to say that means that you are creating a set of steps to solve a problem so in this one we solved the problem together so congratulations you guys just did your first vocabulary term so another vocabulary term that we also did is we had a sequence so we can see here that we have a specific sequence in which we went we didn't step five before we turned right so we go line by line and that's part of a sequence also today we're going to be working on a loop joy great question but I'm actually just gonna kind of leave it as it is say just for kind of like privacy reasons and things like that but I might as a good point so now that we are kind of going here we're going to talk about what a loop is and so Oh good question joy so on you guys's chat box I forgot to share with you you will you should be able to see here for on my chat box yours might be a little bit different but you can say to all panelists or you can change it to all panelists and attendees if you would like other people to see your directions either way works for me okay so a loop is something that is going to repeat over and over so we're gonna take a look at that today in our beaver achiever activity and kind of go from there so I'm gonna do this with you because the last webinar we did together many people were kind of struggling so what I want you to do is I'm on the same screen as you guys you guys are in a zoom screen so if you're in a zoom screen like me you're gonna need to open up your web browser so if you're using it if you're using a desktop computer or a Chromebook or anything like that you'll just need to open another web browser so to do so I'm going to open my browser and you'll see I'm actually already in a browser so I'm gonna stay where I am and what you're gonna do is you're going to go to code monkey comm so we're going to help you out and we're gonna put code monkey into the box here and you can actually just click this link and when you click the link it's going to take you exactly where you need to go so I want you to raise your hand when you're there with me so I can just kind of know that you're ready to login and we're ready to enter that username and password into the box you okay Hanna and Isaac are you guys with me yet if you are if you could just raise your hand and in so I can know that you're there will it's kind of waiting to make sure that everyone's there if you're not sure and you're that's fine if some of you are just kind of following along with me but if you're not sure you can just click on this link right here and it will open in a new window for you okay amazing awesome you guys are rocking it today okay so now what you're gonna do is you're gonna enter in webinar one and the password is also webinar 1 so if you need to copy if you need a copy and paste if you need a copy and paste Natalya has put it in our chat box for you so you can just quickly copy that and paste it into the box for you and I'm gonna do exactly the same as you are as well just so you guys can kind of see what that looks like Thomas just making sure that if you can't and you're still trying to kind of do it are you using Thomas are you using an iPad or using a Chromebook or a laptop that kind of makes a difference sometimes a little bit too okay so when you're in the iPad unfortunately it's a little bit trickier to do the zoom is its own app so unfortunately you'd have to close out the app and then kind of do it from there so if you find that you're stuck you might just want to kind of follow along with us and stay with us and then afterwards try to practice it it's a little bit trickier sometimes with the iPad to kind of do two screens so just hang out with us and we'll kind of follow along and we'll kind of go from there okay all right awesome okay so here we are on the code monkey homepage and you guys are gonna be able to use this account with me today and so what I want you to do is I want you to scroll to where it says blockbased beginner and I would like you to click on the beaver achiever the very first one it says sequencing and loops you can't find it just look for the viewer with the log in his mouth okay so just I know that some of you are kind of trying to get there with me so if you are there with me if you could just go ahead and raise your hand I know some of you are just kind of following along so not a big deal but those of you that are students and you can go ahead and raise your hand so I know if I need to wait for you or kind of give you a little bit more time great you guys are just rockin and rollin today so great so all of our code monkey courses I always have some kind of a story so what do you what is this story here for our beaver so the beaver wants to be able to go swimming he sees that there is no swimming so what does he do he decides he wants to create a dam so that he can actually kind of go from there so in this course here we're gonna drag and drop our log to be able to fill the hole here so some things that I like to point out when we're kind of looking at this at this here is we have our beaver he's hanging out we see there's a hole in the dam and we need to fix it so we have to kind of figure out what we want to do we can also something else to notice is that each one of these rows with the logs is one and we're gonna either be moving just like we practice in our warmup and our unplugged activity we're either going to moving right or we're gonna be moving left so the first thing I want us to do together is I want us to drag the log and connect it with the when play so to make our beaver move or to make this code run we have to click our play button and I have the sound turned off you guys feel free to turn your sound off when you have it connected and you click the play button will see that he'll drop his log and now the dam is fixed all right so we did that first intro one and we got a solution and that's repeating back to us we've got a three star which means that we did the shortest most concise code that we could do all right so now I want you guys to click on the story map up here and when you click on the story map I want you to skip to challenge number five with me so click on challenge number five so remember you click on the story map and we skip to challenge number five Rosanna I will answer your question I hope I'm saying your name correctly but I'll answer your question here at the end with everybody together okay now we can see there's a little bit more that we kind of have to do here so I would like you in the chat box or by raising your hand be able to tell me what should we do oh I did say your name right cool very cool that's very lucky move for me here so in the chat box if you could just please drop in what you think we should do here I see some people saying some things you can go ahead and tell me what I should do oh you guys are man you guys are rock star rock stars okay so I see a couple of things here the first person first thing that you guys are telling me is that we need to drop the lock okay so let's drop it I always like to debug as I go so I am going to test this out and just see if I was correct and you guys are so smart you guys thought this so you can see here that there is an ability to have a super hint here so if we are stuck and we're kind of working through and we need or she kind of what I like to call the struggle bus we're not really sure what to do we can go ahead and click on need a hint so then the next thing that you guys are telling me to do is that I need to move left okay so we're seeing that there's an arrow here and we need to move left so we're going to go in the same direction using our left hand where we want him to go and we see need to move and then I see you guys telling me that I need to have a double drop well let's test it out and let's see if we are getting there you're gonna make it awesome okay so we are gonna get a solution here and the solution is going to tell us if we got the shortest code or if we probably need to do a little bit of work so you guys are doing in phenomenal job okay the next thing I'm going to ask you guys is if you have a microphone connected to your computer if you could please just raise your hand just so I know I might call on a couple of you to answer this next one you so if you do just go ahead and raise your hand so I know that you have a mic if you don't have a mic no big deal just leave your hand not raised okay great I'm gonna leave your hands raised so I can call on you hopefully for the next one okay so now we're gonna go again to our story map ooh I see you guys are progressing movin and groovin here without me so I would like for you to go ahead and this time we're gonna click on challenge number 15 so we're gonna move along and then we're gonna try something and go to my favorite course of superachiever which i think you guys are going to love as well okay so do you guys remember in our when we're talking about vocabulary we talked about a loop so I'm gonna go back one I want you guys to stay on challenge 15 but I'm gonna go back one here and we're gonna talk about a loop here so a loop means that we are doing something over and over and over again and here we see that we kind of have a pattern we are going to move right and drop a log we're gonna move right drop a log and move right and drop a lock so Hanna I'm gonna allow you to talk and I want you to tell me what you think we should do to solve this specific challenge okay Hanna I'm gonna unmute you oh is it working okay let's see if I can okay Hanna you should be able to talk so you should see a microphone kind of like how you can see online here and you'll be able to unmute yourself you can't if you could just Hannah tell me how you think we can solve this in the chat box that will work oh I see you there okay you hear me I can hear you okay okay I already did this oh man you're moving way too fast okay move left again drop and so the oddness challenge so I'm challenge 414 the same challenge that I'm on should we move to wait 14 yeah no sorry that's okay oh yeah okay then moves right drop one right draw right drop one okay so move right drop one right drop one okay so let's go ahead and let's run this watch to check this out okay now using that vocabulary that we use do you think there's another way that we could solve this using something else we have here yeah the loop okay so you see we've got a 1star solution so we could use the loop so what can we so if we pull this loop out here it tells us how many times we want to do something so we have a pattern sort of a blocks here do you agree mmhmm okay so what can we eliminate and put inside of our loop block a little move right okay so we can put the move I'm just gonna get rid of these here so you can put the move right and then what else should we do a drop okay so let's put the drop in and then I need to connect it that's why it's all grayed out right and then I'll hit the play button and what kind of solution do you think we're going to do with this you awesome thank you so much Hanna what a rockstar okay I'm gonna mute you now okay all right all right awesome job again I thank you so much for helping us okay great awesome so on challenge 15 somebody asked me how long this is gonna be we're gonna go just a little bit over our 30 minutes though we'll have some time to kind of go through we're gonna do one more on this one and then we're gonna go to my favorite course of Beaver achiever with the smoothie making so that's my favorite one okay so learning what we did with Hannah Rose on I see that you have a microphone as well so I'm gonna unmute you and if you can also unmute yourself you're able to talk you can tell you can walk us through what to do here oh oh hear me I can hear you okay okay challenge fifteen you said mmhmm challenge fifteen can you walk me through this guy repeat four times okay repeat four times move left move left drop okay drop how many drops should I have um okay okay so let's check this out and let's see what we get here Rosanna what grade are you in Oh fits okay well and where are you joining us from New Jersey Spottswoode oh wow okay cool awesome all right awesome great job okay I'm gonna mute you okay okay all right awesome thank you so much for doing that for us okay so we see here that we got a three star solution on this challenge you guys are rocking and rolling so that means to me that you guys are ready for the next step so I want you guys to follow along with me so now that we are rockin and rollin we know what a loop is we were able to use it and kind of see the pattern that we were kind of working with there is another way to solve this challenge as well but we I'll let you guys figure that out on your own and challenge ourselves to try a new way to solve this one what we're gonna do to go back to our screen is we're going to click on our little code monkey face over here and I'll just take a minute because I'm sharing my screen so it's a little bit slower than yours will be and then we're gonna go down to Beaver and we're gonna click on our beaver achiever with the smoothies because this guy is my fave okay and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna click start coding and when you guys are logged in us as students just know that you won't be able to move around like we're moving around right now this is just a special for this webinar okay alright so now in this one the beaver wants to be able to make some money so he knows that the more likes that he gets on his page the more people are gonna come and visit him here so let's go ahead and we're gonna start playing here okay so this one is a little bit different than the one that we have done previously because we're done we're not filling the dam this one we're actually gonna make smoothies so I'm gonna do the first one and then I'm gonna call on those of you that have your hands raised with the microphone just remember if you have a microphone and you would like to participate just go ahead and raise your hand and we'll call on you okay alright so we have our monkey and so we can see that the monkey likes bananas and we can see that one person is going to be coming to visit us so that only one person is going to give me the monkey so I'll bring out the monkey and I can see that I can change these tiles to be whatever it is that the person my friend wants to have in their smoothie so I have the banana and now I'm going to bring out my blend and serve so these are two different two different blocks that we haven't seen before okay and Hannah I see that you say you can't move try to locate kind of where we are as far as that goes so now we still have our editor in the center our blocks are on the lefthand side and our stages on our righthand side and now we're gonna do the same thing that we did before except for this time instead of saying when clay it says when the customer arrives so we don't know when the customer is gonna arrive we just know that he's coming and so our our monkey gets our banana smoothy alright so awesome all right cool so beavers happy I'm happy monkey got his smoothie and we've got three stars so we're rocking and okay so let's go ahead and let's skip again and let's go ahead and go to challenge number five and let's do this one together okay so same thing here if you raise your hands if you have a microphone so I can call call on you so you're able to participate Hannah I agree with you this guy this one is my favorite because he's so cute and this one and so are his friends all right Thomas I am going to allow you to talk and then all you'll do on your side is unmute yourself now yep we can hear you oh hey Thomas where you joining us from I'm done yeah Oh Columbia oh you're so far away okay perfect so Thomas can you tell me what to do you have to you have to wait add some strawberry okay so I'm gonna add a strawberry how do you know I need to add a strawberry and I don't need to add something different because I'm the board behind the beaver there's a strawberry oh so intuitive okay great and then what do I do next you put it in a blender oh I blend and serve okay and then I need to click what do you think next to make okay so let's push play oh man look that raccoon he's gonna be so excited he's excited just as excited as I were to be if I had a strawberry smoothie don't you agree yeah okay awesome Thomas thank you so much for sharing with us I'm gonna I'm gonna mute you now okay okay bye all right so very awesome okay so now we're gonna learn something called an if and else conditional so we're kind of skipping along and learning some things a little bit faster than we normally would okay but I feel like I'm feeling pretty confident that you can do it okay all right so now we're gonna go to our story map and whew I see some of you are already progressing ahead of me let me just double check this challenge really quickly and then we're gonna kind of do something together exactly okay so I saw somebody was already on challenge ten moving ahead of us but we're gonna go ahead and I would like you to do the story map again and this time click on challenge a number ten and we have a new block here that I am confident that you guys are going to be able to work with so when you are there I am going to lower everybody's hands here really quickly but when you are there just go ahead and raise your hand just so I know that everyone's kind of with me so I can talk about this new block and what this new block does great man you guys are such rockstars okay great I love coding rock stars they're my favorite okay let's make let's help this beaver make some smoothies for his friends okay so we see here that we have our rabbit and we have our raccoon and our rabbit or bunny or whatever however you want to call him we see that he he likes carrots and we know our raccoon like strawberries this time though we see we have three friends so that's a little bit different than something we've seen before so we are going to bring out our if something happens so we're bringing out our if our if statement here and so we want to say if who is going to arrive if our rabbit arrives then we're going to add a carrot and if our raccoon arrives oops you don't want to have this nested that when you have a loop inside of a loop we call that nested okay so when we have our raccoon we're going to add a strawberry we don't know though who's coming in which order so now we are going to go look at that reckon this time sir fancy glasses she has there okay so we're gonna do a super hint here and let's see so I forgot something uhoh what did I forget I forgot the blend and serve how could I forget that so thank goodness I use that super him to kind of help me there so now I'm gonna click run now our raccoon comes back now she I'm gonna assume she has cooking classes a cookie now the raccoon gets his strawberry drink and is just as excited whoo now we have a rabbit coming back up and getting his smoothie his or her smoothie and also super excited I don't know how excited I would feel about a carrot smoothie I don't know about you but Hoonah does and now we have our other raccoon so we had two raccoons and one rabbit join us for our smoothie making party okay so we have the if our if statement here okay and if you have a question you'll see there's the little question there too in case you need something okay so now we're gonna skip ahead and now I would like you to go to challenge 14 okay all right and I'm gonna I'm gonna leave you guys on challenge 14 but I'm gonna go back to challenge 13 and we're going to talk about this so that we can do challenge 14 and one of you can solve it together okay so now we have our we have something new here this is called an if and else statement okay so we see our monkey on the board with a banana and we see our rabbit on the board with the carrot so if the monkey arrives we know that the monkey wants the banana otherwise okay if our monkey if our rabbit arrives then he wants to add a carrot okay so let's loops can't forget the blend and serve so let's see if this is correct so if the monkey arrives and we add the banana if else or elseif somebody else arrives then the rabbit comes and he gets his smoothie and we see we have two people so we had the rabbit and the monkey and who's gonna who's going to be our last person to the party today yeah monkey okay awesome all right so raise your hand if you feel confident that you can help me solve challenge number 15 and this will be our last or sari challenge number 14 this will be our last challenge of the day Hannah razani guys are rocking it Thomas do you feel confident that you could do this Thomas Carroll hope your hand went down Ian do you have a microphone I feel like you could do this feel confident okay so I'm actually going to let Thomas Hannah and Rose on you guys are all going to be able to talk together so give me one second and you guys are gonna help me all together be able to do this again Hannah I feel so bad I didn't ask you where you were from I apologize but whoa yep hi Thomas iris on hi Hannah Hannah's gotta ask you where you work from where are you from Hannah Hannah don't forget to unmute yourself yeah I'm from oh wow okay cool so we have all kinds of people okay so Rosanna I'm gonna have you give me the first tip Hannah you'll go next and Thomas you'll finish us up okay Ian I'm also gonna add you so all you're gonna have to do is make sure you can unmute yourself okay and you're gonna let us know if everything looks correct cool yes yes okay Ann can you hear us yes okay cool can you tell us where you're joining us from we're doing you from Tennessee Oh Tennessee and what grade are you Indian take it oh you're a rock star okay cool so Thomas you're gonna give everybody you're gonna give us the okay to make it runs okay okay okay and ER sorry Ian I met so so it's gonna go Rosanna then Hannah then Thomas and then Ian cool cool okay so Rosanna give me the first step I should do okay anything else statement all right okay razaw are Hannah what should I do next I'm sorry what was that so Thomas yeah you do you have an idea Hanna are you stuck I don't ah miss do you want to give us the first one and then hit and then Hanna will check it over sure okay go ahead the first one is the monkey first year to get the oneman band okay so should we do is it monkey we're gonna add a banana where's the monkey then okay then what else and then do you feel like you can help out Thomas I you want to take a guess okay oh and the record so I should I add it if yes okay in here yeah okay and then what is strawberry and you were right okay out of strawberry play another okay in here yeah oh I need to change the strawberry okay yes you know oh I'm sorry go ahead yeah no yeah go ahead and then what am I gonna do a moose or whatever this guy is an elk a little guy and then what should I do Panama Oh what should I add here change so we have this little elk moose what should I add Mary okay so let's add a strawberry okay Ian do you give us the okay or do you think we had make a change here I think it's good to do okay so let's run it and see what happens oh you just wait look see if a week and if there's anything man if anyone who okay give me all the if statements that you have yeah just keep the statement okay and put add strawberry to the else okay and then put a blend and serve up this oh I forgot the one I serve before oopsie okay let's see all right like it's top hat what do you guys think okay do you guys see how the code is highlighting as we're running through so every single time it's highlighting where its stopping to watch it here oh we did it okay great so we got a three star solution you guys aren't rockstars so we just had to do that now I forgot to add the blend and serve here so I'm actually gonna do that I'm gonna show you how what it would do if we were like this and then we're gonna finish up this was our last I'm gonna meet all of you guys thank you guys so much for your help okay okay so you can see this is still running but there was a more efficient way to solve this so you guys were not wrong on your first attempt I forgot to add the blend answer so that was my fault so we just have we can see that there are as many ways to solve challenges when you're working through things but there is always a more efficient way which is how he shouldn't how he started out the challenge or how he actually finished up right so this is not in correct but there is a more efficient way to do it and was as a coder if you started working and having so many lines of code all the time it would be really really hard to work on your code with having so much so you want to have the shortest amount that you can because it excuseme just makes it easier for you later on okay you guys in a fabulously amazing job on today's webinar so if you get stuck you can use those super hints you can ask a friend or you can review past challenges like we did today definitely encourage you use the super hints and ask a teacher or a friend like I said or you past challenges if you're working in coding adventures some of you guys are a little bit older I recommend working in this feel no challenges okay so really quickly before we end we have just about a minute or so before we finish today's webinar so you have any questions you can either put it in the chat box for me or you can add it in the Q&A box Hannah thank you so much hello as well to you okay and I want to thank my special helpers that helped me today for today's webinar is really great to have some extra help if you are oh that's a good question Oh Rosanna I know you had a question about earlier in the webinar about asking about unlimited as long as you are part of your teachers classroom
