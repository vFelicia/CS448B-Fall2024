welcome to key to success let's learn about keyboard events an event is an occurrence detected by the program in many cases the event is a user interaction examples of events are pressing a key moving the mouse clicking on the mouse let's review the keyboard events you'll be using in the next several challenges on key is a code monkey function that works with your keyboard every time you press a key on your keyboard the on key function is automatically called you can write code inside this on key function to do a certain action when a certain key is pressed so let's look at this example we have the on key function then you've got uppercase k and we have a parameter key so whenever you press a key on your keyboard the value of that key gets passed in to this parameter key and then you can check what that value is we're checking here if the value is a lowercase w step one if you've just pressed the key let lowercase s step negative one so your function could be checking other keys key values it could be checking more key values you could even do something if any key is pressed now an example as it's written here what would happen if the l key was pressed the on key function would get called and the key parameter would take on the value l but since we're not checking for l nothing would happen let's look at a challenge here's a fun challenge we have a lot going on here the monkey is on the turtle and needs to collect these bananas but remember the monkey has to go past these bushes before getting off the turtle and then we have that gorilla so we're going to need to use our potion to get our health up after the gorilla's been throwing things at us okay and remember we're going to do all of this by pressing keys on our keyboard so we'll start by putting down our on key function so remember the key parameter takes on the value of the key you just pressed okay we'll go ahead and use what they're starting us with okay so if key if the key you just pressed is a w step one let's step three instead so this the monkey will step three okay now let's say if the key is equal to an ask i'm going to have the monkey be able to move completely around so let's say let's step negative three so now it goes forwards and backwards let's allow it to turn so if he is equal to a we could turn left the monkey could turn left if key is equal to d we'll have the monkey turn right okay now the monkey can turn how about that turtle so if p is equal to t let's have a turtle step three okay let's see if we could do this you have to press i have to press the keys now to make it all happen so i'll run okay t t okay let's see okay now okay let's see turn okay we can get that banana what if i turn around again try to get those two bananas okay then i'll turn again and walk okay i want to go get the potion just in time you guys are probably better than at this than me there we go now it's your turn to use keyboard events good luck
