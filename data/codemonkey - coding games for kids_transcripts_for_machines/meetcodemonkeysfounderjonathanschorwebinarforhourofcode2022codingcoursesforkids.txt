so um oh sorry so thank you Zach and thanks everyone for uh coming uh that's my favorite time of the year they are of codeweek Computer Science Education week so um a little bit by myself and my background so I was born in Israel uh uh in 82 and both my parents actually are software Engineers um so me and my young brother the uh other Code Monkey cofounder uh started coding at a very young age naturally we were growing up with the first Apple computers at home um I think by the age of 10 we were creating our own computer games uh for fun um so that was my uh background in computer science my entry into the coding World um then when I was 19 I started um um volunteering and education um uh and I started my own coding courses for children the year was 2001. um so that's when I got into my first stage of Education um and that's also when the first inspiration for a cold monkey came from from those classes that I created my lesson plans that uh I created little games for the lessons computer games that children my students had to progress through the game uh by writing code and those games are very very basic like no Graphics at all very basic graphic uh but that was the first inspiration for Code Monkey wow um you know not to give away your age Jonathan but when you started not so long ago but a little bit time ago yeah um now you know thankfully we're at a ploy Place globally where it's more accepted for children to code and to teach coding whether you're in the United States Canada uh India Australia wherever you may be and wherever all these people who are joining us on this webinar um why did you think to teach coding did you know was important back then you know like is it something that you I mean I know it's something you did but why did you feel that it was important to teach coding and maybe and why not math or other subjects it's a good question I started coding in one in a similar course like when I was nine I think my mother signed me up for a like a coding summer class um so I knew from my experience that it's easy to start coding early and that it's it could be a lot of fun it's a fun skill to have um and I was already working as a coder at the time I started during my last year in high school uh having a parttime job in software development it was you know very lucrative uh for for 17 or 17 year old kid and I just thought I was working back then in a like a uh with children from underserved communities like uh immigrant families in Israel um and I just thought this is a great skill I could give those children that I'm working with as an enabler for social Mobility um uh and it actually worked like they they learned very quickly and some of them later chose to to this as a career path um that was the thinking wow very really really interesting so be before we jump into sort of that answer and then go into the start of Code Monkey and how that began um you're a software developer you still have those skill sets what what made what pushed you towards the education world you know you could have been in financial you could have been a sorry for developer in sports and as and especially as we know like there's you know there's so many ways that the you know children today as they learn is that adults can get into different Industries what about education um made you like why did you come into this industry of all other Industries when you had the skill sets to do so good question uh so I think I wasn't planning to like like I said my the house I grew up in was all around software and Tech and Entrepreneurship and nobody was um talking about education as an occupation where I grew up but then I sort of stumbled upon the world of Education in Israel when you when you finish high school you have to go to the Army or either you go to the Army or you do like um social volunteering in hospitals or or education in underserved communities so I did that um and it's really hard once you've started working in education working with children uh connecting with them spending time with them affecting their lives it's really hard to to go back to like a plain office job I think like you really want to continue having this exciting um I don't know influence important influence on others people's lives and and also just having this um this type of like special unique challenge of finding ways of uh giving skills to to young people wow yeah and it's and it's very uh commendable you know one of the things which you know we we bring up a lot is is the skill of coding being able to code in software development is as you mentioned could be quite a lucrative career you could really get great jobs in so many different places and uh to take the time and you know sacrifice you know whether you know not to go into full details but the sacrifice and go into education is quite is quite commendable and and it's paid off given that code monkey has grown all over the world so uh you mentioned how you you taught young students After High School uh young children um coding so maybe you could elaborate on that and talk a little bit about how that led to starting code monkey and sort of that Journey uh and all the different parts there because I know there there's there's a lot there so whatever you feel is uh great for the kids here and teachers to learn so there was a journey uh and I guess I'll start with the end like that the final conclusion from the journey is that timing is everything I guess because after I started those courses uh the year was 2001 and I wanted to create something like Code Monkey right after that like in 2002 but I ended up starting Code Monkey successfully only 12 years later or 13 years later in 2014. um and in between I had to do like I had to sort of wait for the for the opportunity to to mature I guess so I started I went to University I got my computer science degree I started code monkey as a like an academic project um but that wasn't I think a good platform for uh from Israel to to reach a large scale and to create like a good enough product so I had to wait to graduate from University and then I um I tried to start Code Monkey for the first time in 2007. uh with the third Code Monkey founder is shy um but it was just too early like teaching kids to code wasn't a big thing back then education technology is one big thing like No Angel Investors we see like Venture Capital firms nobody wanted to invest in educational technology and specifically in technology for teaching kids to code like everyone said wow this is I would love to have such a product for my kids but this is not a good business to invest in because because not a lot of people uh would want to buy this like just like a small niche of maybe parents who are themselves into computer science and things like that so we failed back then in 2007 and only in 2013 uh the an edtech incubator was started in Israel because attic became I think educational technology became a thing in the in the Venture Capital Community and specifically teaching kids to code uh became a huge Trend back then the big nonprofit code that are responsible for the hour of code week Computer Science Education week was founded by an ex I think Microsoft executive was funded by by Google and Microsoft and all those for them it was simply because they were struggling with the shortage in in software developers so they wanted to to increase awareness to the importance of teaching computer science in school so then when we started Code Monkey in 2014 uh success came uh very quickly I think you muted at least I don't hear thank you um I guess you know you touched on some of this but maybe you could talk a bit about some of the challenges you faced in terms of starting Code Monkey not just in terms of the market but you know you you have that backer and you were coding you were building something you were from Israel you're trying to grow this like talk about uh you know it's important for teachers and students to learn about you know now we're at a different place you have millions of kids using it and and schools and that's fantastic uh but wasn't always like that right at the beginning that's for sure how to what were some of those challenges you overcome how did you maintain that that ability to you know you know overcome those challenges as opposed to just saying you know what I could just go work for a company so there's sort of those two things you know challenges I know what enabled you to ensure that those challenges were overcome yeah um so that's a big question um I guess when starting a startup company um I Heard once they've done a research one it's it's like a caterpillar that has many different legs but all the legs have to take steps at the same time more or less so so like first we created like a prototype of the product um and that was really simple at creating a very small game that children liked and children and actually learned to code while playing it so that was the fun part um and the easy part so to speak because uh we got accepted into this incubator we received like a small investment from the incubator we kept our jobs like parttime jobs and in our the three cofounders we were all coders ourselves so we just created the game ourselves uh tried it in classrooms in schools in Israel um that was the easy part the hard part I guess is getting noticed um by potential users teachers potential Partners resellers schools governments and getting the attention of investors because Beyond just creating a small prototype coding it yourself everything else costs a lot of money like Marketing sales all of that um so yeah it was really just like always finding like the next step I remember for example the first large exposure that we received from users from teachers and students and families would through the computer science education week the hour of code uh we we shared this prototype that we had with code.org the foundation running uh the hour of code and they put it on their website and I remember around this time of the year uh eight years ago we just like overnight received like millions of users um um um yeah so that was one like jumping board for the exposure part and we had similar stories on how like one investor led to him the next investor larger investor than a strategic investor that also played as a distributor in a certain market and and so on so it's always about finding the next step in each one of those um each one of those uh challenges that you're trying to coordinate like exposure Marketing sales funding and of course uh product development right um and just because I have a question right here which I think ties nicely in it talked about challenges and then overcoming those um and you mentioned uh code.org and having millions of users due to the hour of code week that's one example can you maybe share a specific moment um in since 2014 with code monkey that was uh one of like the very happy moments in your in your you know startup process and even now so just something that you know all these kids everyone goes you know teachers they work so hard they have their own challenges and then they come out with like a great test that they studied on so like what is what is your example of that of a happy moment yeah uh well that night when we received like millions of you right so that's a good example that was an amazing week I remember that we almost didn't get any sleep that week we were busy uh maintaining the server so it doesn't crash we weren't expecting this huge traffic uh users um that was one uh other other interesting moments sleep I remember a specific meeting with uh we had like an angel investor putting a small amount of money uh a guy from Israel who's also a tech entrepreneur um and he told me I have a visitor from Japan he's my distributor for my stock company was creating like longrange WiFi routers he said my distributor in Japan is now in Israel I told you about you I told him about your company I think you should meet him and we sat down uh in the beach bar until I believe I remember it was Midday and I told him about the code monkey and like just interrupted me like in the middle of my pitch banged his his glass of beer on the table and said I want in I wanna I Wanna Be The Exclusive distributor in Japan and I want to invest I don't care about the terms like when you're fundraising let me know I'll be the first investor in the next round so I remember that was a happy moment well it is that's great it's great here it's it is unbelievable myself working at Code Monkey just seeing the global reach and how many places we've traveled to it and how many times we see pictures right now for those for those of you who don't know there's uh there's a contest for those who are using hour of code you could take a picture of your children using it and and tweets uh Code Monkey we're giving away a free home license as well as uh a gift card for the best picture for those who are enjoying Code Monkey so definitely uh um maybe uh Angie can put that in uh in in the end or when we'll we'll send it as a followup um Jonathan gonna take a break from some of my questions because in the Q a we've had a couple and it seems like a good place to uh to answer those so one person asked about um would you please give your thoughts on the quickest approach to learn how to code so I would say maybe not quickest but what's a great way to learn code and obviously you'll probably talk about code monkey and why Code Monkey is a great way to learn how to code yeah so so actually I have one important like Nuance to to address whenever uh I guess that question I remember before I started Code Monkey successfully between the first failed the time and the second successful attempt I was working in the software developer um and then like a lot of people were looking to transition from other careers into software development it was the 2000 and uh for like the the tech boom one of the you know Tech rooms um and then uh so you had all those ads online telling you like targeting grownups saying learn to code in seven days learn to code in in uh you know uh 24 hours learning to code uh become a software developer in one month and then I remember reading an article saying like learned to code in like 14 years like the truth about how long it takes to really become a you know a decent software developer and they were talking about like the good software developer they started early and it really takes you to with any I guess skill or job craft uh like to become really good at something to become employable and to become like good at what you do we take Serious um so I guess I will change the question a little bit is what is the quickest way to get like a an initial successful Taste of coding like an exposure to to programmatic thinking um and I think the best way to do that is actually through the hour of code week and all of those different small activities that use the gamified way short gamified course to give young children really a taste of what coding is and it can be using a real programming language like you do on on some of the Code Monkey Arrow code activities or it can be just those scratch style building blocks drag and drop things actually my daughter is now five so I started doing that with her using Code Monkey Junior uh yeah I think it's not the coincidence that those games and the arrow code weak became very popular because I think it's a great way to get quickly into coding not to become a coder quickly but to get into coding yeah it's a it's a great that's a great difference um someone and I and I guess you know using Code Monkey is that has all those aspects as gamified coding and a really just very simple way to to jump into into uh coding maybe not becoming the coding coder in the quickest way again that's not uh the what we we're trying we're trying to get them in and and really get them uh those basic skills so what's what's uh special about Code Monkey in terms of whether it is that jumping in the being ease of it or actually after being in Code Monkey for x amount of years and using it for a while you come out with with what so sort of the going and what makes Code Monkey different from uh maybe other programs not in specific where our code week everyone's all the coding companies are doing great work I think oh they're really there are so many excellent products we're teaching kids to code um and each which one is a bit different but um I wouldn't say that Code Monkey like something unique that no other products have but I I I I would say I will say that for Code Monkey um I think the priority um was always the top priority was creating an engaging experience for the learners for the for the young students and that was achieved through many different aspects of the product uh we always it's always crucial for us to keep the the courses very intuitive and selfpaced so that students uh can learn on their own at their own pace uh to keep the courses like to create the game a very like fullblown game experience like not a gamified course but an actual game and this doesn't mean that it needs to be like a very fancy game in a 3D World with a lot of visual effects and noises and sound of the contrary the the simpler the game is there was a research on that recently in Israel and the simpler the game is the better the learning outcomes are but the game does need to be a fullblown game like it needs to be and there needs to be characters you need to be a plot um the kids need to be like they need to get like sort of immersed in this in this game world so it was intuitiveness the the fullblown game experience um and then of course the pedagogy uh this is the most important thing when creating educational content so it's really like being mindful of a lot of and many many like small details and planning how you break the complex concept into simpler concept and creating this sequence where you build the uh the understanding of each concept like one on top of the other wow that's great and I highly suggest uh I'm sure many of you who are attending this webinar have already tried Code Monkey if not definitely go on codemonkey.com to register for uh free trial it's great so one more question before I get back into my list of questions Jonathan someone asked um May I know why it's called code monkey and the significance of its name yeah the name was very significant it's a catchy name and uh also a catchy logo I think um and um so we sort of borrowed the term Code Monkey uh it's not a term that that we created it was an existing term in the tech word uh uh it's sort of like a funny decoratory term for the junior coders on each software development team like the the most Junior coder coders you refer to them like as an internal joke is code monkeys and whenever you know you you break a large software project into many small pieces you give the the simpler task to the code monkeys like to the junior coders um so yeah so it's actually a decoratory term but there's nobody outside the tech world knows it so we thought we could just use it as a create a character a monkey character and that was actually my brother though the CTO the other cofounder of Code Monkey he came up with the name and the game concept of monkey collecting bananas wow yeah um it's exciting and you know it's Let's uh you talk to Brett at the beginning about getting noticed right you know you created a great program but to get noticed is sometimes Harden requires more than just having a great product that also requires the marketing and how you show so definitely that's been been important I Remember by the way this slide to your earlier question about a happy moment so when I moved from Tel Aviv to New York when Code Monkey reached that stage it was time to move to the United States and start the U.S office so I was getting a lot of reaction in New York like when I was telling people like just visiting a doctor or whatever uh what are you doing oh I started Coleman can say yeah Code Monkey I think I heard of it I think I know it and often I was thinking there's no way this person really knows Code Monkey but but I know the term sounds familiar so it made us sort of being perceived as bigger than than we really were at the time right wherever that's that is it's pretty uh pretty amazing um Okay so you know we we've talked about a number of number of items here about what was how you uh your background and code monkey's background so want to talk a little bit you know Code Monkey started you know eight years ago eight nine years ago what has changed and what has remained the same whether it's uh talk about the platform you could talk about maybe the the company itself but uh you know there's uh it's like a it's a company but it's a live company and there's things going on so what has changed and what has remained the same so we'll remain the same is you know our daytoday of creating gamebased coding courses for children and we pretty much do it the same way that we did it back then we create like a small initial version of a course we tried with children we we write down you know feedback from the user testing then we create a full version of the course release it get feedbacks from students teach your parents improve the course uh this hasn't changed and we you do it through the pedagogy a pedagogical experts software developers animators musicians so they stayed the same and I'm glad it did this is my favorite part of the of our work creating the courses and using them with children and getting the feedback and improving the courses uh what did change is the business side so back then as a startup company your main concern is reaching significant like success Milestones it would allow fundraising additional money from investor before you run out of the money that you raised previously and this was I'm glad we're beyond that stage because this is pretty um nervewracking um and and you you get it wears you out like this this sort of Chase um uh always chasing after a more invest investments before the money Runs Out and now that the companies were established and profitable uh so the business um the business challenge is is something I enjoy way more than the business Channel and the startup stage and it's just the challenge of sort of optimizing the business uh steadily growing it uh becoming better at planning becoming better at planning making business plan executing business plans becoming better at hiring the right people building the accurate teams managing them um better um yeah so it's really now about sort of optimizing the uh as uh as like sort of business professionals right yeah that's uh the right Partners as you know Zach right is something that we really be better in like you know yeah right Partners in each country and yeah yeah it's uh it's also interesting to really see um you know so many so many students who get to benefit from the program and that that focus and and you know keeping to the idea of from the beginning we were making gamified engaging coding courses for kids and we are still doing that and yeah so that's that's it's very hard to continue to do and but you know I can from my own experience it's it's true what's happening um so just looking a little bit to the Future you know we we've for those who don't know and it's it's I I highly suggest you all try out we've launched two new courses in digital literacy uh these are our first noncoding courses we have uh one on digital use um and digital citizenship we launched them this year a few months ago and they're being highly used they're they're beloved they're a new course but it's something that's completely different that we've done in the sense that they're not coding they're gamified learning programs but not coding so um where do you see Code Monkey in five years you know knowing you know we've launched these two courses but any type of vision or anything whether it's the courses or you know um anything like that that you could speak on would be great so I see cold monkey continue to um to grow on the path that we chose the recent few years of sort of transitioning from being um a courses company like specific courses coding courses to becoming a curriculum provider and that means covering Entire Computer Science curriculum according to different standards in different parts of the world so that's not only coding like you said it can include other subjects in computer science and to cover the entire pathway from kindergarten to eighth grade um and also to provide for all the different needs in uh required for for implementing computer science uh curriculum so that's not only the coding courses for the children that we've always been doing but uh also more about teacher resources teacher tools professional development for teachers customer success method that we improve every year to make sure that implementation is successful assessment quizzes um yeah all those other very crucial pillars that uh a curriculum solution uh relies on great um thank you do you with working on teacher tools and um the platform for teachers how do you feel the teacher's experience has been using Code Monkey um if they do have a background or don'ts so it was always uh actually the the problem that we were solving and still are is how to enable quick scaling of Computer Science Education despite the constant lack or shortage of computer science teachers in K8 or in winning K12 and I don't expect that to change soon because um but if you have computer science skills often you would choose um like a computer science in Tech I think that's the reason why it's always hard to find like computer science teachers with coding background um so so our challenge was always to sort of um bridge that Gap and to create a curriculum solution that would not require coding background from the teachers so we're sort of also teaching the teachers or helping the teacher like allowing the teacher to learn with their students as they go along yeah so so being successful with teaching with code monk you definitely don't need to have Computer Science Background the entire ID behind Code Monkey was to create a curriculum that would not require coding background from the teachers right we have um one of the uh attendees of this webinar uh she wrote in the Q a but really page best offroad teachers I know love Code Monkey most of us didn't know anything about coding before using we're learning along with our students yeah yeah and I think that's fun I think it's a it's an interesting it's something that's changing now in the education world with the internet and all like children they can learn things on their own on YouTube and and you know uh teachers are no longer expected to become the source of knowledge and it's more and more common to see classrooms and courses in school where teachers learn something new with their students and I think this is actually like this is sometimes um I don't know a better experience or like I think everybody's having more fun that way um yeah not not just with computer science right no that is interesting um have just a couple more questions here so uh if anyone of the attendees has any questions please make sure you write them um in the uh Q and A and where uh Angie is also answering any of the more technical questions uh so uh thank you very much Angie so um you've been you've been doing you've been at Code Monkey for some time now uh and um there's the happy times and challenging times um I guess this is for for everyone here myself included but how do you maintain the passion towards working at uh Code Monkey towards the same goal after so long right it's uh you've been in a almost decadelong marathon and uh yeah not everyone has that ability so what what enables you to be able to continue the work that you're that you're doing so I think what helps me um actually two things one of them is he goes back to my answer on your previous question that I'm learning to become I'm learning business I'm learning business management this is something I didn't have experience in and it's an interesting challenge in managing a company managing teams um it's about you know like working with people it is a by the way has some similarities to working working in education I feel uh sometimes I feel like my my employees are like my students uh in different ways and I like that challenge and I like becoming better uh um in management I guess um but on the computer science side and what's what what keeps this job interesting is that the market is still evolving rapidly uh it's not like math or English that has been taught like for you know thousands of years computer science is still a new subject it's still not a mandatory subject in most part of the world and to see how the market is maturing and computer science is being adopted in a more serious way gradually all over the world um it makes it more interesting and creates new challenges remember when we were beginning we're not getting questions about like now we're getting like tougher questions from clients about like what exactly do you teach in computer science how exactly do you teach how exactly do you assess learning outcomes like in the initial days nobody cared like they were just doing like just just give me some fun coding activity for my students for the article week and that's all I need and now it's becoming the demand the requirement are becoming more sophisticated so so you know it keeps things interesting so I on that where do you see coding in schools coding in after schools like it's it's clearly being uh put into curriculum globally uh do you see coding ever becoming something like math or science or a language where it's a daily subject or something that's in the weekly schedule uh yeah that it's definitely the trend is obvious if you look you know code.org they post statistics on that and if you look just as a on the American education system uh as an example and also it's probably one of the largest K12 systems in the world uh the trend is obvious like more schools are offering it more students are taking it more teachers are teaching it more states are requiring schools to teach it or to at least offer it as an uh um there's an elective um yeah so so the trend is definitely there and it's and it's very steady so um there obviously the the uh coding is where we focus and we moved into digital digital literacy um to a certain extent as coding grows what other what other what do you feel is very important for young students to learn and for teachers to focus on um in technology education as well you know coding is important for all the reasons whether it's getting a job understanding how technology works all the things you mentioned but you know we have people here where well what's important for the Educators to focus on and for the youngers children to or children and students and adolescents to learn about in terms of Technology so actually I'm very excited about the the recent course that we launched on on digital citizenship because um you know uh parents and teachers nowadays they tend to think like today's children were born with iPhones so we we think and they can do anything on them so we think they don't need to be taught how to use a computer how to use the internet because they just know it uh uh but that is not true so you know they intuitively know how to post something on a social network or how to watch a video on YouTube and to comment uh um but the World Wide Web is a complicated uh platform uh um and it's also uh kind of risky uh especially for children not only for children but there are so many things that you should watch out for and I'm in no way I don't wanna like I encourage parents and teachers to to let the children enjoy everything that they can from using the internet and computers all the great educational content that they consume and social the positive social interaction selfexploration and a lot of great things that can be done and those devices and on the internet but like I said this this though things are now riskfree and children nowadays like adults they don't the fact that they know how to use the internet it doesn't mean that they understand how it works and they don't understand how it works they also probably are not aware of the risks so I think um yeah it's it's a good thing to focus on at a quite early stage um is is the the things that we teach on the digital literacy course how to be safe how to use the internet safely for yourself and also you know not hurting others um because you know it's a powerful tool but like any powerful tool it can be it can be also uh create damage if you're not using it correctly for yourself and for other people right that's that's it's great to know um and uh yeah we highly encourage all of you to try out our new digitals uh digital literacy courses definitely give us any type of feedback Angie is our customer success manager who gets all that feedback and it helps us improve um the courses we have two more uh one comment and then uh one more question so I'll ask the question and then I'll then mention the comment is uh how does Code Monkey contribute to learning stem subjects so we just made sure like when creating the code monkey games uh to include other stem Concepts in it like distances numbers negative numbers angles degrees um in the more advanced courses things like velocity acceleration gravity so um it's uh it's very easy to use coding and Code Monkey it's sort of a playground to practice those math and physics Concepts and Engineering but even in the courses that don't uh deal with stem concept directly the the actual challenge of coding um is well known to to be fostering other sort of 21st century skills even if you're just coding like I don't know like a small game that has nothing to do with stem um the the action of coding the the mental challenges involved with it are very helpful in developing skill that are useful for any other subject and specifically stem like you know critical thinking problem solving collaboration um things like that no that's that's that's great and and I think that's something that we see more and more um and hopefully as as you mentioned as as this Market Global Market changes that people will see coding not just as a subject unto itself that's important to learn but how you know whether it's the computational thinking or the math that you learn or the you know I know globally like outside and in certain nonenglish speaking countries they'll use Code Monkey in English so that they can practice their English there's so many different ways that it impacts um the um impacts other subject areas in their learning and I just want to you know take that and what you mentioned and said uh from from Nicole who I personally work with in the United States she wrote uh this isn't a question it's a thank you I'm looking forward to seeing how working with Code Monkey impacts my students outlook on coding related interest this is my third year using Code Monkey schoolwide your programs allow us to grow and progress from block based to Tech space it's a wonderful program and so thank you very much Nicole for that um and and I think it really ties into everything that uh Jonathan said um Jonathan maybe you could give some closing remarks about Code Monkey about the hour of code um and then in the meantime if anyone asks any more questions otherwise uh we can then wrap up and uh we'll send everyone I put some links there that's codemonkey.com that will lead you to our page our website to see any of the information that you'd like you can sign up for free uh 30day trial if you sign up this week we've changed the parameters of the trial where you can get unlimited students so you can get your old school on it and then also if you go on the second one that's hour of code those are the activities you'll see Code Monkey is one of the first activities on the hour of code page this is out of many many different programs so that's just some of the back office but uh yeah maybe some closing remarks Jonathan for me yeah so it's the hour of code week and I happen to be wearing my Nike uh what do you call that sweatshirt I remember Nike I used to study slogan just do it do you remember that probably in the 90s of course so yeah I would just probably conclude that is the hour of code week just do it just you know choose one of the many different free hour of code activities uh book a time with your students in a classroom with computers or iPads or Chromebooks and just do it just give them these first taste of coding and see where it takes your classroom right that's a great ending uh Jonathan thank you so much for your time uh people from all over the world teachers and students alike uh really thank you so much for for joining this uh really fun and engaging webinar Angie thank you for the behind the scenes work we'll send a followup email to everyone um with some resources some of the links which I sent and as Jonathan said just do it go on uh go.org commoncodemonkey.com sign up for a free trial and really benefit from uh one of the world's best uh primary or elementary through Middle School uh computer science programs thank you so much Jonathan uh nice to see everyone have a great day thank you Zach and Andy and thanks everyone for attending bye
