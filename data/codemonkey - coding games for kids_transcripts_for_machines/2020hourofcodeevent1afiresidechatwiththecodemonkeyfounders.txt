all right so this is our very first as i mentioned our very first coding webinar that is specifically for both students and for teachers and so we want to be able to give both our teachers and our students the ability to access today's webinar so today's webinar is for students and teachers the code monkey team wants to thank you so much for joining us for today's webinar and bringing your questions with you this webinar is something new and we are very excited to have you here with us today our goal of today's webinar is that you get the chance to see how learning to program can take you beyond the walls of your classroom this year has been anything but normal as we know for both students and for teachers and as if it's done anything during this time it's showing us the ability and the importance of going digital and if you would like to ask any questions during today's live event please just go ahead and raise your hand you'll see that along the bottom of the zoom and if we don't get to your questions we will have some time at the end for some q a we're going to be doing a live interview session with our founder and if you have any questions you can also enter those within the q a box so please follow us on twitter facebook instagram at codemonkeystu and let's get let's get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world so like we mentioned today is the hour of code of fireside chat with our founder jonathan shore and like i mentioned you can follow us on all of our social media channels but first we're going to go ahead and take some time to meet our team today and so in order to meet our team i'll first by introducing myself so you can know who i am and my name is lena saleh i am the professional development and sales manager here at code monkey you can email me or follow me alongside codemonkey's twitter i will be leading today's interview we also have zach isakao he is joining us from israel so we'll get a chance to talk a little bit about why he might be joining us oh there he is alongside the bottom there hi everyone and he is joining us from israel and he is our director of sales and then i'll let our next panelist jump in yeah hi everybody i'm brett esquileson vp of sales here so i'm excited to be a part of this and excited about bringing computer science education to more students so thank you great and last but not least we're gonna go ahead and meet today's founder or our founder that's joining us today and we're gonna get to hear a little bit more about his story and hear from all of you all right jonathan would you like to go ahead and introduce yourself yeah hi everybody i'm glad to be excited to to participate and share my story alrighty so we are going to go ahead and get started with today's um interview session with jonathan and so we're just really excited to be sharing this all with you as well like we mentioned so today is going to be an interview style of webinar where we have pulled you all on your questions and what types of things you wanted to see so first we're going to talk about what is code monkey our founder story in an interview and then some live q a so just a little bit about code monkey if none of you have been joining us during any of our hour code events or if you have been maybe learning about us in school we are a fully gamified coding platform really designed to put both students and teachers in the driver's seat it's really fun to play and we really want our students to learn a deep dive into the coding foundation so if you're not sure about that you can always visit us at our webpage at www.codemonkey.com and sign up for a free trial for both your students or if you're our parent joining us as well and then we're going to do a live q a here at the end so the first thing we're going to go ahead and get started with jonathan and his first question from someone from the audience is is um jonathan if you could tell us what was your first job right out of college well um actually it was a job i had actually from since before college and during college as a software developer uh in a you know in a medium sized software firm here in israel so i actually started working for them right when graduating from high school um and it was actually my only job as a software developer before i started code monkey so all the way from the end of high school until i started cold monkey around 10 years later okay great and jonathan do you want to tell us um exactly where you're joining us from because i bet many of our audience isn't sure where you are joining us from or where code monkey is based right yeah good good question yeah so i'm joining from tel aviv israel uh this is where we started code monkey uh israel is famous for its vibrant startup scene and code monkey is is another israeli startup company uh we do have offices in the u.s where i spent a year and a half while building the company um but now i'm back in tel aviv israel all right great and i see some questions rolling in so we got some great questions that we'll have um this is our um question from the audience this is from miss burroughs she's joining us from jericho new york what was the first thing that you coded it was um a computer game like many like many software developers started early uh in the 90s 1990s also for myself the motivation uh for starting to to learn to code early was wanting to create my own computer games and share them with my classmates so that's what i did uh it was like kind of a quest game which were it's a genre that was popular in the 90s and but the quest was happening in the houses of my my classroom buddies sort of so we had to go around their rooms and and and houses in the computer game and find all kind of treasures and hints and so mysteries and stuff oh very cool all right so let's go ahead with our next question and so where um what was the first programming language that you learned so that was called uh logo it actually provided a lot of inspiration also later for code monkey so logo is a programming language that was developed in the 70s in mit for the purpose of teaching kids to code so it's a special programming language that was designed to make it easy for children back then in the 70s and 80s to experiment with coding so computers back then were very basic they were only black and white screens and no advanced graphics and internet like you have today so basically what you would do on logo is write small programs like you see here on the screen that would just draw uh those simple geometric shapes on screen so i'm sure that's for kids today and for people today this looks far from exciting but uh you have to remember this was the 80s so anything happening on a computer was exciting for us back then and that was the way to learn to code for kids in those days okay great and another one from the audience this is mrs she she is joining us from richmond canada um and ms she have something in common zack is actually from canada himself as well um where did the idea for code monkey come from so like i said i started early both my parents are are were you were software engineers so they they put me on like us coding summer camp when i was like eight years old in here um and so i started early and then when i graduated high school i started my own coding courses for children in israel uh and it was like you know this sort of like uh community center uh in a town in the south of israel um and a lot of those kids uh were coming from like limited resources background sort of underprivileged communities and i created these these coding courses for for them which i gave them personally in class but before each class i created like those game like puzzles or challenges that you need to solve using code and i was still using the same programming language that i used for learning logo from mit but it had feature graphics already it was the year 2000 2001 and i was amazed to see how quickly kids can learn to code that way and how uh effective and how um teaching kids to code could be as a neighbor for like future career and uh and things like that so so that was that was that the main you know inspiration for starting code monkey as a company 10 years later i realized i was muted sorry about that um so the idea for code monkey came from when you were working with students younger students and atrisk students so that's really great a good question i'm just going to skip around for just a second because another person had asked this question why did you choose a monkey for code monkey did you do any market research or are you just a super big fan of monkeys so that's a great question so actually the the the the specific concept of using uh monkey catching bananas and calling the game code monkey and the comedy called monkey this side specifically wasn't mine it was my brothers i started called monkey with my young brother who was the main game developer and the cto of the company uh and he came up with this idea because it's kind of a it's kind of like an internal joke so among pro uh stuff teams of software developers uh the term code monkey is used uh sort of like as a joke as a term to to describe the the most beginner coder in the group the one that you give the most simple coding tasks to so he's like the code monkey he's doing the the simple work uh like a friendly joke among coders so the the term already existed code monkey and we just decided to use it as as the theme and the title for for our game and company great um this one is from the audience this one is from miss c rodella she's joining us from chatham new jersey so sorry if i put your your name there um what is code monkey currently working on oh wow a lot of stuff so today code monkey is being used by a player 20 million students all over the world in israel in the usa in china in australia almost any country in the world um a lot of things we've been working on recently are solving needs that came as a result of frequent kobe 19 closures so a lot of features that would allow an easier experience for teaching remotely and for selflearning from home so a lot of the work naturally recently is focused around those special needs presented by the the corona pandemic okay great all right our next question is what is what was the most challenging part of starting your own company and what has been the most meaningful um so the most challenging part i guess uh was to convince because you need money to start a company like code monk developer osmani graphic designers web servers and all of that cloud servers marketing offices so you need money and uh so you need to sort of persuade i need to persuade uh investors uh that teaching kids to code or creating creating tools for teaching kids to code could become also a sustainable business like everyone agreed that it would be a very good product and children would enjoy it and teacher would enjoy it but the most challenging part was to convince investor that it could also create a good business so that was the most challenging part um and the most meaningful part when started the company so our first big success story was in our home country in israel so code monkey was adopted by by the national ministry of education here in israel and they used it to create like a national coding olympics between teams of students from from schools all over the country and what was very meaningful and exciting to see there uh that this many of the schools that did best on code monkey were actually schools from very far away villages in israel that again were school that are serving a community like low resources community a lot of students that didn't even have computers or internet connection at home they would go to school to school in the afternoon with their parents or volunteering teachers to to to develop their coding skills and and and compete in this national coding olympics great okay let's check out our next question why is coding important for future employment um so beyond you know the the increasing the the always increasing demand for software developer like you see more and more needing in software developers in the industry like the industries the software industry is growing every year uh learning to code is important for future employment because uh nowadays even if you don't pursue a career in coding almost anything you do uh interacts with with code either if you're working in marketing for example which used to be uh mainly offline but now most of the marketing budgets are spent online on online marketing and uh it doesn't mean that you have to write code yourself in order to work in marketing today but but if you don't understand how code work and how the internet works and how websites work it would be very hard for you to to be to excel in something like that and the same goes for research academia finance health medicine um there isn't a field today that is not interacting with with software constantly so so even if you don't plan to become a coder being able to understand how computers work and how computer programs operate uh would give you a very important advantage no matter what you choose as your future career great and this one is also from the audience as well this is mrs edison she is joining us for sorry she's joining us from new jersey what courses would you advise students to take in high school and in college oh wow so uh so actually my my best advice would be to take courses that really excite you and that are really interesting for you uh so as as much as i think learning to code is fun and important if if students if a certain student doesn't feel that way then i wouldn't recommend taking that as a high school course i think uh the most important thing is is to learn you know follow sort of your inner inner motivation and inner natural uh interest that would be my advice okay great um so can you tell us some of the other jobs that are um associated with codemonkey and can you tell us also your role within the organization yeah so my role today i'm the ceo i'm managing the organization so i i don't get to do any coding myself anymore which is a pity because i always enjoy that very much but uh yeah today today i'm doing strictly with managing the company and managing other employees and teams and uh setting goals and strategy uh and things like that um but other roles in the company so obviously we have a product team which consists mainly of software developers they develop and maintain the code monkey platform they develop the different games and courses we have the pedagogy team which is in charge of creating the coding courses on top of the coding platform so those are like computer science teachers usually we have the marketing team sales team and the customer success team uh which is doing uh maybe the most important job which is to make sure that schools and and families that chose to purchase uh code monkey subscription and use code monkey as their computer science education platform uh actually are actually successful in implementing uh our technology and content in their homes or or classrooms great all right so i am just having an issue here with my screen so sorry about that you guys okay all right so we are going to um ask another question here in five years where do you hope code monkey is um good question um well basically we want to continue what we're doing uh now but sort of to ex extend the curriculum uh we see a trend globally of computer science gradually becoming uh transitioning from being sort of uh an extracurricular optional course to gradually become part part of the core curriculum so as that happens i hope to see code monkey mature uh accordingly uh from sort of just uh uh like specific courses company a company that provides specific courses in computer science to a company that provides a full computer science curriculum for k12 uh including all the aspects that are required uh from from a full curriculum solution so that means also teacher training assessment and also of course a full pathway of courses from kindergarten all the way to 12th grade all right great i'm just pulling up another question here um if you could tell your younger self thing what would it be and if you could tell your future self one thing what would it be oh those are tough ones um my younger self what would it be um probably um to be uh patients more patients i i guess uh i remember when we wanted to start code monkey the first time it was too early it was the year 2007 and nobody really cared that much about computer science education for our young kids and we just failed miserably uh and and about like seven years later coding for kids became a trend and and then we we managed to start the company successfully but in between the waiting was kind of frustrating for me because i always knew that's what i wanted to do so uh in retrospective you know if someone would have told me don't worry the time will come like uh just be patient uh i guess it would have been an easier experience for me um and um what can i tell my future self um i guess uh to always stop once in a while what you're doing and then try to to remember uh why did you start doing it in the first place like what was your initial motivation uh because it's easy sort of to lose track once you you get busy uh trying to achieve your different goals to lose track of your initial motivation why did you start this in the first place uh so i would sort of remind my future self uh why why why did we start this in the in the first place okay those are all really good um feedback and tips for our students um another question i'm gonna we have one question here now we're gonna open it up for q a for um our students and for our teachers and so because we're out of our own questions here and we want to leave time for your questions as well um one question that i know you already answered privately in the in our q a here is when was code monkey made so the first version was created late 2014 it was really ridiculous we didn't have an animator in the team yet so my brother the the game designer the coder he did uh he drew the characters himself uh it was really amateur looking but but it has a charm you know like a sort of a homemade version of of code monkey very cool um what is your favorite part and this comes from paige bestop and her um in her classroom what is your favorite part of code monkey of the game or um i'm not exactly sure i know that i know that paige also raised her hand so maybe we can ask paige and have her answer that question find her oh there's quite a few of her there so paige if you want to raise your hand i can allow you to speak there so maybe we take another question why she's doing that um do you enjoy coding lion joke yeah i enjoyed coding very much i don't get to do this as much anymore but actually now my favorite part in my job in code monkey is meeting students like visiting classrooms that are using code monkey it's harder now with all the restrictions on travel and and schools in general but when we were still able to do that that was my favorite part meeting students that are in teacher that are using code monkey and hearing their feedback and their experience and the best ideas always come from teachers and their students great we have a question from samantha and she wanted to know how many people work for code monkey um that's a good question so um it's a small company actually um it's we have like fulltime employees we have around 15 in israel uh creating the product and the platform and doing all the back office stuff and roughly another five in the us uh and actually code monkey became very big in in china recently the last two or three years so that's pretty amazing code code monkey classes in china are growing extremely fast and over there there are around 70 almost 100 fulltime employees working in delivering code monkey courses to to after school students in china it's a lot of teachers which is a lot of people working there on that side of the that side of the world so it's great to see us being or that we are working with students all across the world we have another question here which of the code monkey courses are your favorite my personal favorite is dota does math but that's just my personal favorite so what is your favorite um my favorite will always be coding adventure part 1 because that course that i was still mostly personally involved in creating every small detail up because we were still just a very small company just like three or four people uh but it's just because my you know my personal uh part in creating that course i think all the courses are great and they're actually getting better and better as you go along great um another question is have you ever considered um making swag like tshirts and things like that oh we have tons of swag it's just hard to get the swag across now with no conferences because of the the uh because of kobe uh but i'm sure that that's soon enough we'll be back on on the different easties and uh other other k12 conferences and and we're all invited to visit our booth and and grab some tshirts and and uh peens stickers we have them all back there we do we have quite quite a bit of that for our um for our teachers um so we already asked you this question is code monkey worldwide and we will say that code monkey is worldwide we do have about how many users you say jonathan now 20 million users 20 million worldwide yeah okay great so we do have quite a few uh users worldwide um so outside of coding and what you do at code monkey what are some of your favorite activities to do outside of code monkey um sorry can you repeat it like like what are some of your hobbies that you do outside of just owning and being in the monkey company well i became a father a few years ago so i think my my my favorite thing to do now is spending time with my daughter she she turned three recently she's amazing uh but inside of that i like snowboarding i play tennis and i started boxing recently oh very nice do any of the students or teachers have a question that they would like to ask that we can unmute you and you can join us and ask jonathan a question i know that we had a question um about how do you feel about the success of the hour of code um so the success of the hour of code that's an amazing thing and without the success of the hour of code and code.org the code monkey couldn't have been as successful it's just important to me that um the hour of code will be treated as a first step sort of means to an and not the ultimate uh sort of result of computer science education or the strand of teaching kids to code because the hour of code is is is amazing uh as an exposure event exposing teachers and students to coding but but it's important to go beyond that to go beyond just an hour of code and really try to to implement at least a semesterlong course in a classroom great and another question and we do love the hour of code that's how i started coding myself how long did it take you to get good at coding and how many hours do you think you invested on your own time to learn huh that's that's a trick question because if you ask my brother i never got good at programming so uh that's why he's a cdo but uh do you want to tell them what a cto is because i i don't know a lot of the students know it's the the acronyms chief technology officer but he's like the the chief coder um yeah but but yeah to get real good at coding uh i remember reading an article once there used to be when when coding became like a very desirable sort of job skill so a lot of businesses started advertising courses saying become a developer in just uh two months or in just uh i don't know 60 you know two weeks or crazy promises like that become an expert coder in in just one semester and then i read an article saying the truth is to become a really good coder it's like it takes like 10 years like you need to learn and then you need to get a job and you need to learn from your the more ex the more experienced coders around you and you need to learn from mistakes and to see projects succeed and projects failing that job experience is is something that you cannot replace and you cannot fast forward it so it's like a lifelong craft that that you master and you become better and better in do you think that is that why you're so passionate about having students learn how to code at a much younger age or do you find that it doesn't matter at what age they begin coding um it does matter i remember in college i had a much easier time i started computer science major in computer science also in college and i thought it was much easier for me and for other students that had the early start then than it was for other brilliant students that were coding in college for the first time so it's like learning a language that the earlier you start the easier it is for you great okay so it seems that nobody's raising their hand to jump on here to ask us questions so we'll round out here with um just one more question and that would be um i don't know i was just sorry i just forgot i was gonna say um why did you guys choose to use coffeescript as the main language for coding adventure um i thought i still think it's the best gateway language because it's very it's a very user friendly like coder friendly language the syntax is very clean very compact uh no semicolons and other crazy characters that you need to to insert every line uh so it's very coder friendly very easy to learn on one hand and on the other end it's super useful because it's actually a version of javascript which is the most uh useful language uh in the world today because it's sort of like the programming language of the internet of the web browsers on every phone every tablet every laptop or computer so it's like the best of both world it's both very easy to use and very powerful so that's why we chose it great all right um well we just want to thank everybody so much for joining us and dealing with our technical difficulties we do have another webinar this wednesday with our other cofounder and that is idoshore and that's jonathan's brother so he'll tell his story and answer a few questions from his own perspective and we just want to thank jonathan so much for taking time out of his day and it's very late in israel so we're happy that he was able to join us and so we just want to thank all of the teachers and all of the students for joining us during this week's event and we hope that you spend some time this week exploring some coding courses and hopefully exploring the code monkey courses and our newest course our space monkey space adventure course as well and again we just want to thank you from everybody on the code monkey team for joining us and all that you do to support us and um jonathan do you have anything to add uh i just want to thank everyone as well thank you leena for hosting this thank you brett and zach and and thanks uh thank you all the teachers and students that participated and asked questions like i said this is the the best part of my job interacting with our with our users we agree this is one of our favorite parts as well and if we missed any of your questions or you didn't feel something got answered please tweet out to us or you can email us at info codemonkey.com and as always remember to write code catch bananas and save the world we'll see you guys next time bye bye
