welcome to comparisons let's learn about comparisons equal equal sign is the equality operator so it is two equal signs next to each other a single equal sign is the assignment operator that you use with variables but when you want to see if two values are equal you use two equal signs and the equality operator goes between values and it compares the left value to the right value to determine if they are equal to each other or not here's an example if health equal equal 100 so that's checking to see if the function health which returns a number if that return number is the same as 100 if those are equal this condition will be true and you'll go to the banana let's look at an example here's an example where the monkey wants to get those five bananas uh but the gorilla does not want the monkey to get those bananas and it's going to start throwing things at the monkey so we need to make sure the monkey's at its best health so we have this little health zone object here that we can go to to get more energy so we are going to um for being bananas so we're looping through the different bananas we're going to go to the health zone and we're going to want to wait here until our health is 100. okay so that means we want to say until in our condition is going to be i think health i'm going to check our health that returns a number and we're going to compare it with the the quality operator to 100 okay so until it's 100 we're just gonna wait and when it's get rid of this when it's um actually 100 we'll leave the until and go to the banana let's go try that and up here it will tell you it's house number so i think it's going to be going back to the health zone yeah that gorilla is really beating up the monkey has to go back a lot but i think you see the what's gonna happen here we'll get all the bananas and three stars is less than is another comparison operator it goes between values is less than that symbol determines if the left value is less than the right value so for example in an if statement we could have a condition like this health remember is a function that returns a number so if health is less than 70 it will run the indented code which in this case says i am weak else and you're going to reach this else if health is greater than 70 or even if it's equal to 70 you would reach this else and you would and you would execute the indented code which in this case says i am strong let's look at an example here's an example where the monkey wants to get a bunch of bananas but we have the gorilla that's going to get in the way so we'll need to go to the health zone so let's see how we're going to do this here we have a for loop um where we're going through each of the bananas we're going to go and get a banana and then we want to check to see if the health is lower than 70 and then do something about it if it is so let's see if our condition would be health is less than 70. all right what do we want to do we want to basically go to the health zone and while there we are gonna wait until our health is equal to 100. we'll wait until that's true delete these two lines and when that is true we'll just go back up to the for loop and get the next banana and then check all of this again let's see if that works all right looking good okay okay has to go back again we got it now it's your turn to use comparisons good luck
