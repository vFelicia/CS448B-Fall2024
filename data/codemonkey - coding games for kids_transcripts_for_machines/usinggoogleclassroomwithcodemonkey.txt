hi thanks for joining this is a short demo on how to use google classrooms with code monkey so um this integration is available for teachers who use google classrooms um and they would need to log into codemonkey using their google account using the google single signon option and with this integration after logging using google as a teacher you are able to import your google classrooms onto codemonkey with the students in them of course and you will continue to manage your student roster on google classrooms you'll have option to access all the classroom features but managing your student list will continue to be through google classroom with this integration you're also able to post coding adventure assignments to your google classrooms there's currently no full integration with google classroom assignments or any stream functionality so i'll show you that um later on uh your students after you've imported your classroom they'll be able to log in to codemonkey um using their um google accounts um and once you've imported your classrooms your study students already belong to their classroom so they don't need to do any action to to join it themselves so let's start so i'm going to sign up to code monkey using my google account so just make sure you use the google account with which you are using google classrooms i'm going to click on google single sign on so i'm going to choose the google button here and i'm going to choose the account that i use that i'm going to use for this purpose that's where i have my google classrooms great so a few things i need to fill in here before i proceed and now i have signed up to code monkey i've created my teacher account let's choose my avatar as a new teacher i get a 30 days trial with an option to add up to 30 students with access to some of our content i already have an example classroom which i can check out but what i really like to do is import my students so they can start accessing code monkey so i'm going to click on create new classroom and i can either create a classroom or i can choose to import my classrooms from google so i'm going to choose that option and first thing i need to do is to give code monkey permissions to access my google classrooms by clicking on connect with google classroom and you would only need to do this once and if you won't give this permission then you will not be able to import your classrooms and it shows you what this authorizations allow to view your google classrooms view your roster and i'm going to click on allow and i can now continue to import my classroom so clicking again on import from google and now i have the option to choose my classroom so this drop down menu would only give me classrooms that i manage on google classroom so if you want to import your colleagues classroom you first need to make sure that they add you as a teacher um onto these classrooms okay so i'm going to choose a classroom and next up i'm going to choose the subscription i want to connect this classroom to this would determine what type of access my students get so for now i'm going to connect them to my teacher trial because that's the only access i have as a new teacher and that's really the default here and i'm going to click on create my classroom great so my classroom has been imported i can see the classroom right here in my classrooms list uh if you want to import additional classrooms you would need to do that i just repeat the action again and choose the classroom you would like to import great so i'm going to click on the classroom and go to the students tab just to see the students that were imported along with the classroom and just one student that's the student who i have in my google classroom as you can see i can't really do any actions because like i said you would manage your roster through google classroom you can see this sync classroom button on top so anytime you make any changes to your roster on google classrooms just click the sync button and it will sync the roster also on code monkey if you're looking to add additional teachers to your classrooms on code monkey just scroll down here under coteachers you're able to import additional teachers as coteachers on your classroom basically they would have um access to the classroom dashboard and access to the courses as well you would click here to choose the teacher you would like to add as a coteacher and you would need to first make sure that they are added as teachers to this classroom on google classroom that's the only way for you to be able to choose them here at the drop down menu if there aren't any teachers then you won't see a teacher here so i'm going to click and click on import code teacher and the code teacher was added they can just now log in with their account and they'll be able to see this classroom last thing i want to show you is how to assign coding adventure assignments so this is relevant and available for coding adventure and through our lessons tab if you're not familiar with it you can check out the short tutorial right here and each of coding adventure lesson plans we have play time that's when after the insta introduction usually um you just let the students play the relevant challenges um and with your google classroom you'll have this uh yellow button here assigned to google classroom uh basically you can click on that and it will post an assignment for your students on google classrooms so i want to quickly show you how it looks like on google classrooms i'm in my teacher account here in google classroom this is a monday classroom and here's the assignment i have assigned from codemonkey and basically clicking on it let's go to instructions i can manage and edit it from google classroom um right here so i can add additional instructions i can edit the title i can add attachments um and i can also give a due date or sign it to specific students basically the students with this assignment they get a link and the link would um refer them to play the relevant challenges and how would it look for the students so i'm again in google classrooms just signed in as the student in monday classroom and i can see here the new assignment that teacher has assigned to me so by clicking on it i'm in the assignment i have here the link which will lead me to play the challenges and once i'm done maybe i want to tell the teacher i'm done so i can either send a comment class comments or private and i can also mark the assignment as done and then the teacher would be able to see this on their google classrooms this knot will not be reflected on code monkey last thing i want to show you is the student side on codemonkey and we've been getting questions about this so i'm a student in monday classroom my teacher let me know that i can now log into codemonkey using my google account i'm in the login page i'm gonna click on google and then i just need to choose my google account so clicking on that and i'm redirected to codemonkey i can choose my avatar and i can start playing thank you for watching this demo if you have any questions please refer to our help center
