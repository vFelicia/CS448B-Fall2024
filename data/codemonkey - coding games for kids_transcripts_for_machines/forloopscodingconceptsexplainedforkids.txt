hello welcome to the four forest let's learn about four loops use a for loop to repeat code for each item in an array so for example if you had an array called bananas and there were 10 bananas in the array if you say for b in bananas this for loop is going to repeat for each banana in the array so it's going to loop 10 times and each time this variable b will hold a given banana so the first time through b is going to be the banana with index zero the second time it will be the banana in bananas with index one and so on all the way through all the bananas however if bananas just had three bananas in it it would loop three times let's look at an example here's a challenge where we have six banana objects and each of these bananas are in an array called bananas here we have bananas with index zero so each of these bananas have a different index and since there's six of them the index is 0 through 5. now if we look at the code we know we want the monkey to pick up all those bananas so if we look at the code we're using a for loop for b in banana so this is the name of the array and because there are six bananas in this array this for loop will repeat six times each time b which is a variable will b will store a different banana so the first time through b is bananas with index zero the next time through b is bananas with index one and so on all the way to bananas with index five so it repeats six times and the first time through when we say turn to b we're really saying turn to bananas with index zero and step the distance to bananas with index zero and then the next time through we will be turning to bananas with index 1 and stepping the distance to bananas with index 1. now one point i want to make is b is only valid within this for loop if i use b outside of this for loop it would not work you know the program would not recognize b it's only valid within the loop let's look at it let's go ahead and run this first and then we'll look at another example you see how it's nice how we see what b is each time b is bananas four b is bananas with index five here's a challenge with turtles we could see in the challenge that we want the monkey to step onto the turtle and then have the turtle move to the banana and then the monkey to step onto this turtle and have the turtle move to the banana and then have the monkey step onto the last turtle and then have the turtle go to the banana so we have three turtles and three bananas uh you have to decide sometimes which array you want to loop on and we have the starter code that tells us we are looping on the turtles there's three turtles so how many times will this for loop repeat three times and each time t is going to be a different turtle so the so let's see we want to step we probably don't want to we want to step more than zero we want to step the distance to this turtle but we know that later on we're going to want to step to this turtle and then here we're going to want to step to this turtle so instead of saying you know turtles with index 0 instead i'm going just to say step the distance to t because t will change each time through the loop and then we're going to have the turtle that the loop is working on step 10 let's just make sure that is 10. ah it's actually 20. so let's put 20 in here instead okay let's see how this works okay t is turtles with index zero now t is turtles with index one and now t is turtles with index two you see how flexible that is now that we have reviewed for loops it's your turn good luck
