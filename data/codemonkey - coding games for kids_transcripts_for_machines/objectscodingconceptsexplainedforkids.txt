welcome to objects and friends let's learn about objects many programming languages are object oriented including python java and our very own coffeescript in code monkey objects are the characters on the screen and because coffeescript is object oriented it means that you can use those objects in your code let's look at an example here's a challenge that has several characters on the screen you can tell which characters are objects by hovering your mouse on top of the character and if a name pops up it means it's an object that you can use in your code so of course the monkey got the turtle both bananas and all these bushes but is the ruler an object no and gordy isn't one either but all these other images are objects now let's see how we would solve this challenge so we want the monkey to get the apple in the stream and also the apple the banana in the stream and also this banana so the monkey will have to somehow i think get on the turtle have the turtle move across the river and then go and get this banana also so what we could do is we have the command turn to and we could turn to any object i mean i could turn to one of these bushes but i think i want to turn to the turtle so i will say turn to and because this is an objectoriented program i could just say turtle and then i could step now i don't need to mention the monkey in my code because since the monkey's the main character of the challenge you never it automatically will do the monkey the step and the turn two will automatically refer to the monkey uh but if we want the turtle to step i'd have to mention the turtle so right now we're gonna have the monkey step 10. so let's run that okay so now the monkey is on the turtle so next we want the turtle to go in step so because we want the turtle to step i actually have to say turtle step and let's see how far it is okay i think it's 15. okay so turtle step 15 so it's actually turtle period step step space 15. okay let's run that okay we're all lined up i could have the monkey turn to the banana object but they're saying i also could just walk backwards and that would be less code so let's do that so do you remember how to make the monkey walk backwards yeah you use a negative number okay let's run one more time okay we did it hopefully that explains how different characters are objects and you can use them in your code now it's your turn to use objects good luck
