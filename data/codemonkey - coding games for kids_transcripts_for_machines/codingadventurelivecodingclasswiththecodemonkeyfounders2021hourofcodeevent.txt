that are joining us live on our social channels please also share with us where you're joining us from and what grade levels you teach right we will get started in just about one minute here kicking off our 2021 live coding class with our founder all right we are going to go ahead and get started if you haven't done so please tell us where you're joining us from and what grade levels you teach in the chat and we are ready to kick off today's event so first we are today is the 2020 one hour of code webinar series this is part two of really part three in our series for the csed hour of code 2021 so today you are joining us for a live webinar with learning to code with our code monkey founder today we will be meeting the founder in just a few minutes so this is obviously our favorite event of the entire year the csn week and the hour of code we have been part of this event for seven years and the code monkey team wants to thank you so much for joining us with all of your students and teachers who are joining us for the webinar both here on zoom and across the social media channels and those that will be catching us later we know that there are a million choices that you could choose during this hour of code week cs ed week and we thank you that you're taking the time to spend it with us if you're if you're catching this at a later date you're watching the recording later we also want to thank you so much for spending your time with us we are excited to share this year's hour of code and we have some special announcements at the end that we'll share with you as well if you haven't done so already please make sure to follow us on all of our social media channels we are streaming to all of those social media channels today um and be sure to also catch us on linkedin as well during today's webinar you can also tweet at us using the hashtag cmwebinar i mean sorry excuse me cmhoc which is down here in the right hand corner and my team is also here to answer any questions that you may have and if you have any questions for the founder please pop those if you're joining us on zoom in the q a box or anywhere else on in the chat box and we'll save those during our live q a session here at the end so without further ado let's get ready to rate code catch bananas and save the world so we always like to share first just a little bit about our story and kind of how we got started so in 2014 code monkey's cofounder and ceo jonathan shore launched codemonkey after working with students of younger ages and different ability levels and just seeing that they really grasp the concepts of coding much much more when it was presented in a fun and gamified way and so that's how code monkey was born today code monkey is a leading fun and intuitive curriculum where students learn to code in many real programming language from block based to text based to full python and so we really hope that you give us a chance and spend your time coding with us during this hour of code week so to kick things off like to introduce our team that's always an important part of this is so that you can meet us as well my name is lena salle i'm the professional development and sales manager here at code monkey i've been at code monkey for about three years now and i was a former teacher as well so we also have a couple of other panelists joining us today we have boaz and boaz is our coo which is our chief operating officer and he also does all of our marketing for code monkey that means anything you see on social media any blogs the web pages that you see all of those things are done by blaz and his team we also have brett he is our vp of us sales that means that how your teachers are accessing code monkey beyond the hour of code he works with myself and our other team to make sure that everyone is prepared for computer science and then we also have maya she is our customer success manager and a customer success manager make sure that our teachers have success using the platform and so that's what our team does all together for you so without further ado we're going to introduce our founder and ceo of today's event in our superstar and that is jonathan shore so i'm going to let him take over hi everyone can you hear me yep we can hear you great so it's a pleasure uh to be here it's my favorite session of the year um and thank you all for participating um yeah so just very briefly myself um my name is jonathan shaw i'm the cofounder and the ceo of code monkey we started the company efficiently almost eight years ago uh but i've been teaching kids to code um since the year 2001 so that's 20 years from uh it's been 20 years now and i've been coding myself since a very young age i think since i was eight uh i will talk about that in in uh later slides so i've been coding for more than 30 years and teaching kids to code for uh for 20 years um and i'm combining those two passions in code monkey since 2013. and we're very thankful that you have put together this so we're excited to do a q a with jonathan and learn a little bit more about his story and then we're going to kick it off doing a live coding class where you get to learn from him himself so we're really excited about that so let's talk about our outline today so we're going to do an intro just discussing a little bit about code monkey learning a little bit about jonathan he shared a little bit about himself already but we're going to dive just a little bit deeper how code monkey got started and then he's going to leave a coding class with you all i'm walking you through our coding adventure course and then at the end we will save time for q a from you the teachers and students so be sure to save those questions and pop those in the chat box we're really excited for that all right so now it's time to kick off our interview and learn a little bit more about jonathan so jonathan tell us a little bit about so you are the ceo and we know that you cofounded code monkey but can you tell us a little bit about what you do at code monkey um yeah so i'll try to explain um a code well when we started code monkey um like i brought my my software development experience and and and coding education experience to sort of create the vision for code monkey in the product and then with the other cofounder my young brother ital the cto uh we created together the first course which is now called coding adventure we've got and that's also the course that we're gonna use today so that was you know writing the first inspiration and vision and creating the first course the sort of the course that that uh brought us our initial success and fame uh and started the code monkey brand coding adventure uh what i do today uh is quite different as the company grew uh i unfortunately i don't get to spend any time at all coding uh at least not coding uh like part of the product uh the only time i get to code is when i try new courses new code monkey courses then then i i type some codes to go through the courses like like a code monkey student or teacher and also i don't get to participate as much as i used to in creating the courses because now we have pedagogy experts and product managers and developers so um i uh unfortunately well it's not only bad but i i i focus more on the business side today and on management and i'm planning the strategy for code monkey so deciding which markets to focus on what which directions to expand the products to building the team creating partnerships with other education companies around the globe and so on so it sounds like there's quite a lot involved with being um the ceo of a company and i think that obviously jonathan just talked about what does a ceo do so he does the hard part the hard business part of making those hard decisions about how to bring coding to you all and making sure that the courses that we have are aligning and meeting all of your needs so he's a very busy busy he person get to have as much fun coding the product although i will tell you he's always very very excited when we launch new courses and he gets the chance to play them just like you all that's true um so jonathan if you were not so you are an entrepreneur somebody who started your own business um alongside edo which will also be teaching a coding class tomorrow what would what career path would you have followed if you weren't an entrepreneur or if you didn't start code monkey so i actually started code monkey twice i started once in 2007 and failed miserably and then i started again in 2013 so i guess i would repeatedly try until i finally get it done uh but in an alternate universe where i'm not starting code monkey uh i would probably start some other stuff so i started i had other education ventures and business ventures before code monkey uh and between the two attempts the failed attempt and the successful attempt so definitely would be an entrepreneur uh if i couldn't be an entrepreneur then probably i would i would just focus on teaching uh like i would probably continue teaching parttime and working with kids and then uh coding uh for a living um the rest of my time probably sounds like you have quite a passion for not only starting businesses um but also teaching so it makes sense why kukmoki is the product that you went with so um what was it this is not a question that we had originally asked but since he mentioned this um what was it like when you did have a failed attempt at starting code mcgee at the at your first go around um it was very confusing because i knew we had a good product a good idea because i did teach kids to code using that concept that we created for years and i saw that it was working very well but i couldn't find a way to sort of scale like bring that idea to uh as a product to to students beyond the students in my classes uh so it was pretty frustrating confusing to know that you have something good but you don't you can't find a way to sort of get it out there uh but i learned a valuable lesson uh for entrepreneurs um that sometimes you just have to wait uh for the right timing and then you know eight years later it was eight years later or seven years later six years later that coding teaching codings teaching kids to code became sort of a trend because started getting more attention and that was the right timing for to start code monkey and that's where that's when it finally worked sounds like with a little bit of luck on your side and a lot of grit so a lot of hard work that sometimes and failure this is something we learned from our women in stem webinar yesterday that sometimes we just have failure and we have to figure out what to do with that so it sounds like you had a new approach and strategy coming back in from taking a step back exactly um so switching a little bit of gears here so um something that i think is important for students to understand and so when we start to make the transition out of our regular classrooms and start thinking about the future i think it's important for people to see what for you specifically what is something that you look for when you do hire a person to join code monkey or if you had another business venture that's a great question uh and it also ties well to what code monkey does uh the curriculum so really the main qual the main two qualities that uh uh i look i look for uh potential employee our problem solving abilities and sort of being selfsufficient in learning new skills in the current work like rapidly changing uh work environment you cannot afford to hire a person just for their current set of skills because that the the required skills change rapidly if you look at i don't know customer success the tools that we use uh for customer success or the tools that we use for marketing uh even yeah and the tool that we're using obviously for developing the products and and selling it they change so quickly if you hire someone that doesn't have this ability to learn new tools on their own and just find ways to solve challenges uh creatively on their own then they will become very like highly inefficient in in the current environment pretty quickly yeah so it sounds like you have to be adaptable so being able to know that things don't always go the way that they seem they're going to go and then also having those problem solving skill sets which tie really perfectly with learning how to code those same types of skill sets exactly that's great um okay now what was the first programming language that you learned earlier you mentioned that you started learning to code at around the age of eight um so maybe you can share a bit about a bit with us about what first what was the first language that you learned so the language was called uh logo uh logo yeah that's a screenshot so that's a programming language that was developed in uh in mit um i think in the late 70s um was the and that language was developed for the purpose of uh being a gateway language for children for like for teaching kids to code or exposing kid to coding for the first time so it's not a programming language that is used in reward scenarios like for creating real software products it was designed uh teaching kids to code like the first coding language for children as you can see it wasn't that exciting like i mean even when we use future like more modern versions of logo in 2001 when i started teaching kids to code you could mainly use this coding language to create those simple geometry shapes and drawings but you have to remember that back then sort of the the bar for getting people excited from things happening on the screen was much lower we didn't have smartphone we already like people hardly had their own computers with colorful displays so even just drawing a shape like you see on the screen now uh often was enough to get kids excited uh in a coding class obviously today we needed something far more uh engaging it looks very much like a old school paint exactly very exciting nowadays for nowadays students yeah um so which of the code monkey characters is your favorite so that's the turtle uh and the reason for that is uh when using logo in the logo programming language uh sort of the object that you program you code in order to create those drawings on the screen is like uh they call it a turtle in those old computers it didn't look like a turtle just looks like a small triangle but the concept is that you have a turtle with a pen uh attached to to its uh tail and then you code the turtle to move on the screen and then the pen draws like leaves a marker line and that's how you draw those uh shapes so then we thought it would be funny around challenge 10 like level 10 in code monkey i think that's when we introduced the turtle as a surprise and and the instruction says oh my god it's a turtle so that's like sort of a an internal joke funny there's all kinds of things that always have there's little little tidbits of of things sprinkled throughout right that have ties to other things um i would say my favorite character i love the penguin that you meet later on in coding adventure i think he's super cute with or without the bow tie so that's one of my favorites um since we are having an avatar competition where we're having students create their drawings and turning them into code monkey characters do you which avatar do you use so i used the cat the ginger cat because that was my first path we actually found him when he was very little and his eyes were still shot and we needed to let it drink like milk substitute from uh those things that drops a little drops i don't know what you call it in english so yeah that was my first pet was this type of cat so that's why the character was introduced uh no i don't think so at this point yeah i wasn't that involved in the daytoday of uh yeah like choosing the avatars but when i saw that it's an option now that was an easy choice for me makes sense we also learned that sanda also has one of our full stack developers also does cats but that's because she likes to save the world and save cats um okay so now we are going to click kick off doing our live coding lesson and it's going to be led by jonathan which is going to be we're really really excited about um so let's start off with today jonathan is going to be doing coding adventure and we'll talk about that in just a couple minutes but let's just discuss a little bit about what is textbased coding um okay so i'm not sharing my screen yet right so textbased coding so it's funny uh textbased coding it's what uh adults or like in the in the software industry is just called coding uh in the education industry in like computer science education uh for for kids uh you say textbased coding to distinguish uh between this regular classic way of coding and the blockbased method of coding which was introduced also by an mit product in in the 90s called scratch so you have those blocks that are very popular in the recent decades for introducing programmatic thinking to young students so you actually sort of learn the logical elements of coding and you build algorithm programs without typing any any textbased code yourself and i'm code monkey on our first course coding adventure the one that we're going to try today what was different about it is that it was the only course that introduced coding to young learners through textbased coding from the getgo so instead of starting with blockbased coding and then gradually transitioning into text base we came up with all kind of tricks and and technologies that made textbased coding easy enough for kids and we actually think that uh while doing that we've actually created a more engaging uh user experience for children because we think that the fact that they're actually typing codes like like real adult coders from from the getgo actually adds to the excitement um for them and also teaches them sort of a more advanced skill um earlier yeah and i think that a lot of our teachers also express that they like that the students are learning real textbased code from a much younger age it gives them the chance to kind of have that exposure and then also to really get the chance to really understand the concepts i think block based could be a bit tricky to really identify that but here you can see the step by step that's created from that um and so we do use a language which we jonathan talked about is coffeescript and so do you want to talk a bit about coffeescript um i can mention like the brief history so javascript became the uh the most useful programming language sort of by chance it was never designed to be so widely used but since the it was javascript was a language that uh created just for adding some um like capabilities to websites uh what in the beginning websites were just static pictures and texts and links and then javascript came along to add some things there's just very little tasks so when you type in a password or your email address on a website the website can verify that the email address is a valid email address things like that then it became super popular because you had browsers on all devices and then javascript became the only language that is supported by all the devices in the world even mobile phone like smartphones but it's it's it's uh really like javascript is not very user friendly so for the developer it's not an elegant language so coffeescript came to fix that and it created sort of a more uh coder friendly version of javascript when we started codemonkey coffeescript was trending we thought it's a good gateway language because it's very userfriendly it looks almost almost like plain english and it's as useful as javascript because it's coffeescript actually translate to javascript when you run it so uh it was both very useful and very easy to to use and teach and just so anyone's wondering java is also a type of coffee right so java coffee so they kind of go together so if you ever wonder these are real languages so now we're going to dive into what is coding adventure the course that we're going to be using so you can tell us a little bit about what coding adventure is so coding adventure like i said that was our first course i think for two years that was our only course and that was the course introducing textbased coding using coffeescript to children uh through a game where a monkey where you need to program a monkey to collect all the bananas uh on the screen in order to move to the next level so we're gonna get the um bit we're gonna get the chance to do that and so we talked a bit already why coding adventure um was created created so that um students could have a better understanding of the concepts rather than learning in as jonathan discussed javascript which could be quite tricky especially for younger students to code so that is how coding adventure was born and if you notice here on this specific challenge that we have here which we won't go that far into this specific challenge but you'll notice here it looks a little bit like something that we learned about before a little bit like logo where the turtle is kind of dragging here um so just kind of noticing those those subtle hints throughout the platform as well secrets that you probably didn't know before all right so now jonathan is going to take over and he is going to do our lesson on how to code with coding adventure all right so i'll share my screen my browser's window can you see my browser window yep we can see it all right perfect so what i did i just googled uh code monkey hour of code uh and then it has us like multiple results because we have different hour of code courses and each our code course is actually sort of a sample of the full course that we have a sample that is free uh where you don't even need to log in in order to start playing it you don't even need to create a free account a trial account you can just click start playing and that's what i'm going to do now so i'm clicking start playing and i'm going to start the coding adventure on the code course so oh no we must get our bananas back press run to get the monkey moving so that's a little short instruction that we get beginning of each level each challenge so i'm gonna press run and see what happens that was easy so there was only one banana we got it so we solved the challenge we're moving to the next one so those first levels are just introducing the platform uh this is why we didn't have to type any code the code was already there we're just introduced to the concept of clicking around and then seeing the monkey executing the the code now can you fix the code on the right it should make the monkey catch the banana so now it's a bit more complex and before jonah jonathan start yeah turn that down a little bit we love those sounds but it's hard when we're sharing that with her with others so background sounds off okay so let's see now um so we have step 10 here is the initial code and if i'm going to click run let's see what happens before i start changing the code i first i always like to run it as is first to see what the problem is if there is a problem let's see so i'm clicking run the monkey takes 10 steps and it's not enough so i'm getting a hint use step 15 instead of step 10 so let's try that keep trying so the keyboard animation here is a hint to what i need to change so i'm going to delete 0 and type 5 instead i have now step 15 on my line of code instead of tap 10 step 10 i'm clicking run now the monkey goes all the way to the banana that was pretty good now let's learn some new tricks next challenge you can use the ruler to measure distances so again the first few challenges are really just teaching us how to use the code the the sort of the mechanics of coding adventure the different tools we're not getting into any real coding concepts yeah so the ruler here is a very useful tool i pick it up i click on the monkey i click on the banana it tells me the distance between the monkey and the banana step 12. i hope i did that right so now i'm gonna delete 0 and type 12 and let's see if that was accurate no that was not enough let's see i didn't do it right i'll remeasure click the monkey click the banana oh it's 20. okay so i'm going to change 12. delete it type 20 instead hit the run button again monkey monkey's executing the line of codes to the next challenge okay so now we're learning about turing you can make the monkey turn to the banana by using turn left or return right so we're learning a new command a new function uh and also we're gonna write our first program that is longer than one line so we have two lines here turn left and step 12. like i usually do i'm going to click the run button before trying to edit the code see what happens if i just run it as is if the monkey turned the wrong way i'm getting a hint you just turn right instead of turn left so why do you run why do you run the program before even though the tip told us to step right or turn right why did you d why did you run the program first so um call that i guess debugging that's a very important concept in coding um like most of the time coders they don't write new code they actually spend most of their time fixing or improving uh or adding capabilities to existing programs um so you most of the time you have to deal with existing code and for me and for many other developers the best way to do that is to first run the code that you have that was written by other people or was reading by you in the past and now you have to revisit it so first you run what you have to see what happens uh for me that's the easiest way of sort of understanding uh the situation what needs to be changed or fixed um so like we did here i realized we need to change turn left to turn right and i don't have to type right uh letter by letter you see i have those buttons uh uh on the bottom end of the screen so that was one way for us to make uh textbased coding easier so you don't have to actually type the text letter by letter often you can just use those buttons and he types the the commands and arguments for you turn right step 12. i'm gonna click the run button first code that's longer than one line great okay it calls me to sign up because i use this as a guest i'm gonna skip this because i already have multiple code monkey accounts but when you're using this with your classroom as a teacher i really encourage you to click the sign up button it's going to allow you to set up a classroom classroom for free a student that way your students their work is stored on our servers and they can pick up from where they left the next time or from home or if you do another coding lesson they don't have to start over and it's free uh and the teacher can also keep track of students work and progress through the teacher dashboard uh once you sign up for free code monkey teacher account i already have that like i said i'm gonna just skip this and continue coding as a guest what happened okay click on the button below to enter code oh so here i'm being introduced to what i just told you in the previous challenge and how you can use those buttons instead of typing so in this challenge i have to not just fix the existing lines of code i have to add my own line so it has turned left which is correct but i need to make the monkey also step towards the banana after it turned towards the banana instead of typing letter by letter i'm just going to click step and i'm going to click i'm going to type 12 the numbers you do have to type by yourself so i type 12 let's see what happens if you make a mistake um with the spelling is it does it make a difference if i had a capital t instead of a lowercase t so definitely and that's a frustrating part about textbased coding that you have to be very accurate even a small spelling mistake or even like you said just using a capital t letter instead of a lowercase letter let's see let's try to change this to step with a capital s so that's gonna make that's gonna break the the program let's try and run it yeah fixed line two i don't know what step is so that's uh thing about computers you have to be very accurate with them uh like human being can sort of uh understand from context even if you have a typo or if you use uh you don't use the correct word but with code and with talking to computers you really have you gotta have zero mistakes you gotta be very accurate uh even to the point of not using capital letters that's something that you see common or that programmers will see common when they're doing like sprints which is a really long run of creating something to get some product piece or something program that they'll have errors right the syntax is always the trickiest part you spend long time coding and then it's pretty difficult right to find those syntax errors exactly and and uh some of the technology we created in codemonkey was around making those error messages more clear because what you see here like you type step maybe you meant step like those type of thing like when you do on a google search where you're searching for something and you had a typo and google is suggesting the right term so like real coding environments they don't do that they just tell you something is wrong um something is wrong on line 12 and you have to figure it out on yourself and on code monkey uh we put a lot of effort uh when creating when building the platform so that the error messages will be uh more clear more coder friendly okay so we we made it all the way to challenge what is this one is this challenge um 10. challenge five five okay so now we're solving a real problem uh we need to get to the bananas but we have this line of bushes this fence uh blocking the way and we have to walk around it so i think like this is the first taste of what it means to sort of build an algorithm uh so like we said we need to be very accurate and ex you know so with computers with code you also need to be very explicit you can't just tell the computer just go around the bushes you have to use very simple welldefined uh instruction and create a set of those instructions sort of like creating a recipe uh it needs to be 100 like uh welldefined so the computers knows exactly what to do uh so we need to break down uh our plan of walking around the bushes into small uh small pieces uh the computer can understand so we have the beginning typed in for us so the first thing we need to do is to turn left so that we don't face the bushes we want to walk like around from from the left side so turn left step five will not get us far enough let's use the ruler if you want to get all the way sort of above the bushes you need to be i mean the rulers try this again you'll notice you just have to click on the top of the monkey's head and you have to drag it if you don't and you won't get as accurate as a read exactly so i need to take 15 steps all right so let's do this step 15. let's see what happens so far and what do you guys think after he runs step 15 what do you think is the next thing that we should do and there's our heat there is a that helps us okay so while you guys think about that we're going to continue solving this together so that that hint told us that we need to turn right after exactly yeah so i'm clicking the turn button instead of typing turn and a space and then i'm clicking right then i already measured this so i know that this path here is also 15 steps i think step and type in 1 5 15 and i'm gonna click the run button all right and i got three stars maybe now it's a good time the next challenge to explain what is what is the meaning of the stars uh the star score um okay we're going to have to start from scratch here i trust you young coder okay so i have to go all the way to the banana here and obviously i can't just do step 20 or wherever the distance is because the monk is gonna the monkey can't swim so i need to go around and use the breach um but i also noticed that this one didn't have any code in it before why is this one why is this one different right so this is uh something important to to mention mainly for the teachers so we call those challenges assessment challenges uh once in every few challenges uh we put in what we call an assessment challenge and this the purpose of the challenge challenge is sort of to summarize everything that you've learned in the previous challenges and combine all of the new skills and knowledge into what a solution of a single challenge and the purpose is not only to recap it's also to assess whether you actually learned uh what you were supposed to learn in the previous challenge and and you know you really understand it and you know how to to use uh what you've learned so we start with a blank document of code to in order to really make sure that you're not just sort of running and debugging fixing and somehow getting it sold you're really creating the solution from scratch when you're using the teacher dashboard those assessment challenges are highlighted so you can if you want to make sure that the student really learned uh what they were supposed to learn you can sort of just look at the score that they got for the assessment challenges um so here um let's see to go around um distance here is like five i think let's try this the other one is 20. so let's do this i'm gonna turn left step whoa okay step um five i don't know why it created all those blank lines i had a cat stepping on my keyboard um try that orange ginger cat yeah well it can't be that specific one that one passed away um so turn right let's try to walk all the way to the bridge and turn right i'm going to step to the bridge 10 steps and i'm going to step again from the bridge to the other side of the river and i'm going to turn right towards the banana okay this is an example of a spelling mistake so i'm going to try this one i have step five on the last line i didn't even get there because okay i didn't delete the step 20 it just fell in the water okay so i'm going to delete the line from my previous false solution i'm going to start by turning left before taking any steps um i'm going to fix this because i want to show something different now and last step step to the bridge step down from the bridge it went too far okay it went like too far past the banana so let's try and do this step eight okay but i only got two stars for this solution and it's telling you so with six lines or fewer to get the third star so the thing about writing code usually uh it's not enough to write a piece of code that does what you needed to do in this case get the banana get the monkey the banana uh you usually expected also to solve the solution in the most elegant way possible in our case the most elegant way usually simply means with the fewer lines of code as possible so i use seven lines of code in order to get to the banana here and it's telling me that there is a way to solve this with just six lines six lines of code and if i'll find that solution i'll get the third star so anyone has an idea how do i how do i get rid of one line or how can i combine two lines from my solution into just one line of code you guys can put that in the chat box for us while we're while we're working through this together so do what would be a way that we could change this to make this a more to get a three star oh someone says change it to step 18 instead of step 10 and step 8 accurate that is accurate right so i don't need even though i'm stepping onto the bridge and then stepping down from the bridge i can actually do both those i can achieve both those um like sub goals uh with just one line of code by combining 10 and 8 into step 18 10 plus 8 in one in one line so let's see all right now i got that third star okay and now we're gonna leave some time for q a so i know we only got through a few challenges but i hope you guys um learned a little bit from um jonathan a really quick though before we oh you already stopped sharing oh sorry should i put it back on yeah we can put it back on i want to ask a question really quick sure screen while you guys were we were working through these challenges and learning some things jonathan talked about syntaxing making sure we have the right spelling but one thing we didn't discuss is what is the difference between turn and step so we notice that there's like a difference but what are those so we see that they are step and turn but what exactly are those things what do they mean between step and turn are they commands are they are they functions well what are those yeah so actually it's a good question there's a lot of confusion around around the terminology and the reason is that in different programming languages they use different terms for that in coffeescript which is actually a version of javascript we we actually don't call those uh elements commands we call them function because coffeescript is the functional languages so everything is a function and functions always take arguments uh like in math um um usually like always actually commands they always take like input we call the input arguments or parameters so for step for the step function the the argument or the parameter would be a number simply deciding the number of steps that you want to be taken for turning it doesn't have to be a number this challenge introduces also the option of putting in a number as an as an argument for the turn function function which would be the number of degrees to turn what we've done so far we use special arguments um in the form of left and right so those are just sort of like constants or sort of abbreviations for specific numbers so left really just means 90 and right means negative 90. and that it's so you would get the same result for typing turn 90 or or for typing turn left but it would just make the code more elegant and more easy to write and more easy to read that's very important but like i said coder spent a lot of time reading other coders code so when it says turn left it's it's much easier to understand what the program means then if it said turn 90. makes a lot of sense okay now you can yeah all right okay so now we are going to take some questions from our audience and so if you have any questions go ahead and pop those into the chat box or into the q a and that's including anyone who's joining us on any of the other social channels so a couple questions that we did have is um what um hold on i just thought i just lost this is um what are the future plans of code monkey um that's a great question um so um in terms of expanding the product we are um adding uh planning to add more coding courses for middle schools we feel like that we have uh more for elementary schools than we have for middle schools and we wanna balance that out a little bit so more more more coding courses for middle school probably the next coding courses and uh we're planning also on adding computer science courses that are not coding courses so if you look at the computer science curriculum that is being gradually adopted around the world in the united states but in other countries as well computer science is not only about coding um it's about other kind of digital skills and even soft skills like problem solving collaboration um digital literacy online safety uh just understanding how computers work and the word works in the internet so we're planning to add courses around those topics as well great um this question says how will codemonkey help in building ourselves how will codemonkey help in building ourselves like as personalities oh that's that's uh that's that's an excellent question um so it's it's the same as how how coding helps uh and and you see that in many things like for example like when you when you have your kids on a i don't know sucker uh you put it on a soccer soccer class or like football or baseball you don't necessarily aim for your for for the for the child to become a professional athlete um but you it's obvious that they're picking up many skills and personal qualities along the way that are transferable to other things like persisting collaborating being creative uh not giving up and and and solving problems creatively and consistently so i think those are just examples of the kind of qual personal qualities uh and traits that that you can enhance while learning and practicing coding which i think are really great skill sets that transfer exactly what you're saying beyond just life of being a programmer so i think that those are important skills that can really transfer to anything like being an athlete or um anything at all um one question that we had here is um if you could how can you encourage students of a young age to get into programming or teachers to try it yeah so my personal belief on that i'm getting anyone to do anything not just students or teachers also employees or partners or friends family members is really searching for their sort of inner natural motivations and then tying into that so i don't know if you have a kid that likes to play computer games uh i would try to work from there like saying how would you like to try and create your own computer game or modify a computer game that you enjoy playing on your phone uh and if the if the child is excited about that idea then you go into okay do you know how computers games are designed and modified that that is done through code how would you like to learn to code and eventually if you do well enough you'll be able to create your own games or modify games that you that you already play um another question i really like the tip of modifying too because i think students will have to recognize other someone else's code and try to interpret their code to make it their own so i think that what you were mentioning earlier is programmers don't necessarily always create the code from scratch but oftentimes they're modifying other people's code so i think that's a good tip as well another question that um students had is do you have any thoughts on how students can become entrepreneurs at a young age do you have any tips um yeah i think um it's uh it's a good question um hard question like yeah i think role models uh are 95 percent of any educational uh experience so if they have uh people in their environment that they that serve as a positive role model for them and they aspire to be a little bit like them and if those people have entrepreneurial sort of mindset or um yeah way of living um then that's the best way and a teacher is can often be very entrepreneurial if they come up let's say with their own initiative for teaching staff that are not in in the mandatory curriculum or teaching in different methods or initiating some activities in the school uh so yeah the best way i think is to to set a personal example i think that's great or finding mentors i think mentors are really important and i know there's a lot of um there's even right now like a lot of communities for students to have mentorship and i would encourage both teachers and students to seek those opportunities because lots of people like us in the industry want to give back that's what we we do we're passionate about helping teachers and helping students and i think that if you can find that it's a good one so another our last question since we're we're out of time here is how has coding helped change your life um wow these are tough questions aren't they i owe a lot to coding um but i don't know if i'll go back um back to the early years of coding for myself um it was just a good way for me to find friends that were sort of on a similar mindset as i am because i wasn't like i was a bit quiet a bit shy as a child uh in elementary school uh and once i got into this world of coding it was a great way to find like sort of likeminded uh friends i guess my first friend one of them was also a cofounder of code monkey we've actually been coding together since 4th grade or something like that so it was really for me just sort of finding my sort of place in in in society i guess and finding friends and finding them also finding my career path i think that's i think that's important i think it's finding something that you're passionate about is important and and it's okay if your passions change over time and and it sounds like even your transition yourself has changed from you are fully doing programming and teaching programming and now you're kind of more in the business entrepreneurial role so sometimes those things will change it doesn't mean that you stopped loving your first passion but it might kind of change change gear so we're going to wrap that up with that last question so thank you and that question did come from bhutan so um we've had people all over the world actually watching right now so that's been really great um we want to thank jonathan for spending time with us he is in israel at our corporate office so um he's it's quite late for him so i'm sure he's ready to get home and see his family as well so we thank him so much for leading this coding class and taking time out of his stay to spend spend with you all and we also want to thank all of you teachers and those that are following along during the hour of code i think the most important thing to take away from the hour code is just give it a try this week is really meant to be an unintimidating way to try out computer science so we hope that you check out some of the courses that we have and that your students will also find their passion with computer science we also have one more webinar tomorrow with jonathan's brother ido which you can see over his shoulder there so he'll actually be leading a block based coding class tomorrow with you all um about our newest course block jumper we do have an avatar competition so teachers i encourage you to check out social media for that and then we will have a couple of blog posts coming out about different jobs in cs that might surprise you like sportscasters and different things that use computer science that might surprise you um and then also how to launch an hour of code event so again thank you all so much for spending time with us please tag us and all of the things that you're doing for hour of code we love seeing what you're doing and representing us and thank you for welcoming us into your classrooms and until next time remember to write code catch bananas save the world we'll see you guys next time bye
