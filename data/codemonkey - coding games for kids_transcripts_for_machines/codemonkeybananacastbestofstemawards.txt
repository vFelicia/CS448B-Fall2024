to start a company is hard enough to start a company with a concussion I know it did it took a long time to really fully heal from um and I had some just great companies that worked with me that I am so grateful for today because they took a chance on me and said let's do this project let's do that project that's amazing and it probably I mean sometimes traumatic events like that are turning points that really light a fire you know under you and amazing things come out of it it's true and I tell people I wouldn't say um I do it all over again because if I had fallen differently I could have I could have died right and um and it was also a wakeup call that I was just handling far too much right but it was a turning point and where I am now oh my gosh I work with just some of the most amazing companies as clients and I love having my own business and I love being able to um build my business around values that are important to me of good science education and people being healthy and you're a role model you really are you can read about denen is impressive enough but now to know that she had a concussion while she was doing some of you have no excuses guys I know
