welcome to function farm let's learn about functions functions allow you to name a set of commands so you can take some commands and like package them up and call them a function and then you can later call that function you just want to make sure that you define your function before you use it so here's an example i have a function that i'm defining called spin now i have an equal sign and in parentheses is the parameter of my function more on that later dash greater than sign and then within the function you can use that parameter so your function becomes kind of like programmable you can pass different values into this parameter and your function can do slightly different things each time so this is the function and then later in the code i'm calling the function spin and i'm passing it 4 so this argument 4 gets passed into the parameter n so n becomes 4 and then i'm i'm spinning four times if i would have had spin five then i would have spent spun five times let's look at an example here's a challenge that uses a function we're defining a function called go to and we have the parameter a so we we're going to use that parameter a within the function so we say turn 2a and step distance 2a but what is a well when you call the go to function you're defining what a will be so go to bridge bridge becomes a so we're turning to bridge and we're stepping the distance to the bridge and then the next line says go to match so match becomes a so match is being passed to this a passed into this a parameter so now we are saying really turn to match and step the distance to match so you can see here the mouse will go to the bridge and then go to the match grab it and then we basically want to turn around and go to you can use this little go to button down here go to the bridge and then we're going to go to the pile and then we'll drop it now you've been using functions all along like the turn to command is really a function step is a function distance two is a function these are builtin functions now grab and drop our functions also but they have these empty parentheses and that's because nothing is being passed in you don't have an argument so if you don't have an argument following your function you have to use the empty parentheses okay so let's go ahead and run this and look right here next to the function as we run okay so it's telling you a is mat bridge and then a was match now a is bridge a is pile so it's giving you a little information let's look at another example here's a challenge where we have two functions the go to function and the collect function and i wanted to show you this one because the within the collect function we're calling the go to function so a function can call another function so let's look at the challenge itself we have the mouse wanting to pick up all of these matches and bring them to the pile so if we look at the main code we're cycling through all of the matches by using a for loop for m in matches and then we're collecting m so each time through this loop m is a different match the first match will be matches with index 0. so m will be this m will be matches with index 0. so when we say collect m we're passing to the e parameter matches with index zero so we're going to go to matches with index zero so that's going to get passed to the p parameter because we're calling the go to function and we will turn 2 matches with index 0 and step the distance to matches with index 0. and then we'll grab it and step negative 10 and then drop it why are we stepping negative 10 i think that's our problem we need to fix that because we just want to bring it to the pile and drop it so we could say go to the pile we'll always want to go to the pile um to drop it so we could just say pile okay now when we run this look at right next to each of the functions and there's going to be a little posting that will show you what p and e is each time and that will change depending on what we're passing in as m so let's take a look okay see how matches are zero with index one matches with index two okay very good now it's your turn to use functions good luck
