always helps a bit when you when you are unmuted alrighty so we're going to go ahead and get started to honor your time we know how valuable and important it is so we just want to thank you so much for joining today's annual hour of code webinar the code monkey team wants to thank you so much for joining us and spending your time with us today oops so we are doing today's hour of code webinar for teachers please follow us on all of our social media accounts twitter facebook instagram you can follow us at s code monkey at sorry at codemonkeystu for all of our social media accounts and as well make sure to check out our code monkey blog we always share lots of fun unplugged activities and different things that we've been up to here at codemonkey during today's webinar you can also tweet at us using the hashtag that you see here at the bottom codemonkeywebinar we will do our best to answer any live tweets during today's webinar my team is also here to answer any questions that you may have so please chat with us along the side or preferably placing your questions in the q a if we don't get to you right away during today's webinar we do have a q a session and then following today's webinar a survey survey will pop up and once you take the survey a professional development certificate for your time today will be emailed to you so let's go ahead and get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world so first we're just going to go ahead and introduce the team to you it's always nice to know who you're looking at who you're going to be working with over this next 30 minutes um so i'll go ahead and begin my name is lena sollay and i am the professional development and sales manager here at codemonkey you can email me at lena.setcodemonkey.com or follow me on twitter at lena codemonkey or sorry at lena codemonkey and we're gonna go ahead and introduce the rest of our team yeah hi everybody i'm brett s wilson i'm the vp of sales here so i work with a lot of different schools and districts and partners that are getting started and ramped up using code and we're excited to have you all here and answer any questions you might have great thank you brett hi everyone i'm molly schubach also on the sales team so i also work with schools that are looking at adding code monkey to their coding programs thanks for joining us today and again send your questions through the q a or the chat box awesome thank you molly i'm going to answer this question um just really quickly jane thank you so much for your question should we sign up for a free account to best follow along with this webinar you don't have to sign up for a free account quite yet today is just going to be a walk through of everything and then following up directly with today's webinar then i would suggest signing up for an account alrighty so once again if we don't answer your questions immediately during the webinar today we do have a q a followup session or q a session here at the end of today's webinar and if we don't get to your questions we'll make sure that we will follow up with you directly after today's webinar so we first just like to talk about what is the hour of code obviously all of you guys are joining us to because you already know a little bit about the hour of code but the hour of code was really just designed to be an introduction introduction into computer science really designed to really show that anybody can learn coding and that coding can be very fun it's not really about learning all the basics of computer science within one hour it's not realistic it's really just a way to open up the window and show that coding is really for all and that as long as you take the leap that it can be easy and fun and engaging for students so it's really more about um just teaching both students and yourselves that computer science is fun and that you can learn at any age which is really something you can't do with a lot of things and the computer science is not limited to one hour of coding there are thousands of events that happen during computer science education week that go beyond the hour of code we have one that we'll share with you today at the end of our webinar as well and it involves activities other than just coding that are all under the umbrella and celebration of the hour of code um one of the biggest things that we've seen during covet 19 as you all know is that there are so many job opportunities within the digital space that require students to have some sort of an understanding of computer science and you can see that with just how even the retail season or black friday went this year it was completely all digital thus meaning that we need more people to fill those roles so there's a lot of openings in those roles and they tend to just we really want to open the window to all students and all learners and not just a certain type of learner we know that others are saying there is a need for computer science of course one of my faves bill gates and then there's also governors sharing the importance of computer science and how important it is for students to learn computer science so our webinar objectives today we talked about what is the hour of code and really how it kind of began we're going to share code monkey's story how to find us so we're going to reveal our newest code monkey course and then what sorts of things will you need to consider when running your hour of code course and then we will explore the courses and then have time for q and a at the end so pretty fast and furious in this 30 minutes so bear with me and i hope you're ready for the ride um so code monkey was founded or really born in uh 2014 with the code monkeys cofound there are two brothers and their best friend they found that the company their computer scientist by from very young age they really love doing computer science and they found that when teaching students traditional coding languages they just didn't really learn in the same way and so when they started to make it more gamified and fun using code monkey students really grasp the concepts and they were more engaged and they felt less restricted to learn how to code so today code monkey is a reading fun and intuitive curriculum we do have students worldwide i think we are almost at 15 million users and it's where students can learn to program in real life coding languages we also have many teachers who have taught themselves to code also throughout the program so that's exciting too what makes codemonkey a little bit different is that um it's really fun and easy and it's more gamified it's userfriendly and intuitive and really we desi we have some tools to put you in the driver's seat a lot of things can be restricted you may not know the answer so we really try to put you in the front seat driving the car and it's also extremely easy to roll out as well so now we're going to announce code monkey's newest course i don't know if you've been following along the email threads but we've been dropping along puzzle pieces along the way so our newest course is space adventure or space monkey so we'll get into what that looks like it's really fun and i think your students are really going to enjoy it so we currently have nine hour of code courses and so we're going to get into exactly what all of those look like it's really exciting it spans really the great grades k through almost if you use the moonlander with the physics almost through 10th grade so pretty big span so before we get into diving into the courses and all what all of that looks like let's talk about where you can find us for the hour of code so for our code courses you don't need to have a teacher trial i'll show you how you can do that um but you can actually showcase and code the students can code without having to have a login for the hour of code so how you will do that is let's go ahead and do that together so hour of code last year it used to be code.org it had it hosted now it's its own domain so it is hourofco.com when you go there i just clicked on the try it so i'm here at the main page our code.com and i click on try it and when i click on try it then it will bring me to the courses here and over along the side you can click on any specific computer company you could a tech company that's here and you can find us at code monkey studios here when you do you'll see there are two categories beginner and comfortable so in the beginner courses we have our space adventure beaver achiever code monkey junior banana tales does math and coding adventure and then in our comfortable think about that as the more advanced courses that's our game builder trivia chatbot and our moonlighter moonlander is the most challenging out of all of the courses it is physicsbased concepts and so just keep that in mind with your students if they don't have much exposure to coding want them to have as much fun as possible and to not feel frustration so that's how you can locate us here through the code.orgs page or another way that you can um find us is by going to sorry excuse me is by going to codemonkey.com backslash our dash of dash code or you can scroll down to the bottom of codemonkey's website in the footer you'll see our code and you can find it there when you do excuse me when you do get to the hour of code page what you'll see is the hour of code activities you can sign up for a trial here if you would like the trial does include 100 seats and gives you access to basically all of the hour of code with all of the features the teacher resources student accounts and all of that so here are the hour of code courses what happens when you click on any one of the courses that you want to take you can start playing right here without any login some other things to note on these hour code pages are it tells you what grade levels there for and what concepts will be covered and then there's also teacher notes and standards if you want those as well but in the teacher notes when you click on access teacher notes it's going to give you an overview what things you'll need so i see some people asking me what students what devices students should use and what you kind of need for the setup it'll be all located here within each course and it'll tell you all about it and then how to prep it there are student certificates that you can download beforehand we'll talk about that a little bit more and then there is a trailer and different things to kind of get your students excited so we have one of these teacher notes for every single course that we offer so just something to keep in mind there also want to sign up for a teacher trial you can do that on any of the hour of code courses or you can click up here in the right hand corner at sign up and when you click on sign up logged in so we'll not let me do that but it will let you choose how to sign up there so that is there for you like i mentioned 100 seats just for the trial it is just the 30 days 30 students oh you're sorry used to be 30 days 30 students now it's 30 days 100 students okay so now let's get in and talk about our hour of code courses where we should start who they work best for just so we can go ahead and do this fast and furious for time um i am going to answer this question here do students have to log in do students sorry i lost that question really quick do students have to log in to access the hour of code activities they do not but if you would like to have some of the features which i'll show you here in just a minute you do want your students to have an account okay so now we're here on our hour of code courses so code monkey junior is our prereader course it's really for prek k it's really about computational thinking this is the only course here that we have that is appbased it is the only one that has an app for the course the rest of the courses will work with an ipad best used with a keyboarded device just to kind of keep that in mind except for oops i didn't mean to do that oops sorry guys except for the courses that require python so those are something that you want to make sure that you are using that with your students a keyboard or device it's really important to have a keep it a device also real computer programmers type on a keyboard so something to just kind of keep in mind our beaver achiever is a block based course it's really for grades one and two it works through fundamentals of the coding concepts just like all the other ones do it's really fun you help a build beaver build his wall up and there are a few other courses with our more advanced packages for that our dota does math is supplemental and includes addition and subtraction um measuring with measuring distances there's also multiplication inside of that one and then they also do some angle measurement where they pick up a protractor and use that so that's one of my favorites honestly especially being a former fifth grade teacher um and then moving right along we have our coding adventure course this is the first course from code monkey itself um it is in what we call coffeescript well not what we call an official language called coffeescript it's a webbased language it's just a not very syntax heavy it's a much cleaner code for students who are learning how to begin coding um syntaxing curly brackets all of that can be really difficult for students so we really want to um you know get them excited about coding and this teaches them the fundamentals after that we have our game builder course and the game builder with i just mentioned this coding adventure should be done pre should be done prior to students doing dota does math and the game builder the concepts that they used are covered in this one so you would want your students to do that first um i also will answer this question there's some people asking about the recording we will send this recording out after and it's always available on both our webinars page and our youtube channel so the game builder course is event driven programming students will work through that and then our newest space adventure course is also in coffeescript as well it's so much fun i just recently played it as it's a newer course the students work through space and they have to program him to move forward and backwards and then work to eventually get him to his spaceship so he can go home and then we have our banana tails and trivia chatbot those are both in python banana tales you help this baby monkey collect his he has you have to help feed him by using this car to get to him and then the trivia chatbot is exactly what it is a chat bot that does trivia that the students program and work through and that is python sometimes i suggest that students do banana tales before trivia chatbot if they don't have much experience coding just to kind of get them familiar with python itself and then the moonlander course like i mentioned is similar in the same way that it's set up to the game builder course but it is working with physics content concepts they work with thrust and acceleration and they have to basically land the moon lander onto a pad i'm not the best at playing that game because i'm just not very good at playing these games but students rock it out of the water and it's great to see them doing that as well okay if you're ever wondering we do have our code monkey course page it does have an alignment there and then you can also see that on the hour of code course as well so now let's go ahead and explore the courses so we can kind of dive into that and explore some of the teacher features that will really help you when doing this hour of code virtually or in person as well okay so i am logged into my code monkey account and you'll see i have some classes set up here and i'm just going to go into the back end of the well let's do the courses first and then let's go into the back end so i'm going to go to the courses you will assign this for your students like i mentioned here on the courses it will tell you what type of language it is and then what grade level it should be for and so you'll see this is a block based course and that kind of thing but what you'll see in what for these hour courses you'll want to look for the hour of code courses if you have an account you'll need to make sure that these are either assigned or unassigned to your students so they can see them so in the beaver achiever course itself let's go into this one the students really love this i'm not sharing my sound with you there are lots of fun fun things that uh fun sounds and animations and things that happen with it so this is just a drag and drop they need to help this beaver fill his um his damn because he wants to go swimming there is a story line that is associated with it something to mention if students are not logged in for the hour of code activities what happens is the students move through linearly through the coding concepts and so you'll see i'm logged in as a teacher so i'm able to do wherever i have a star score is the challenges that i've completed with students doing the hour of code activities just keep in mind if they don't have log in with an account their progress will not be saved at all so they'll have to if their computer crashes or you know the hour of code week of hour of code is always busy for all the hour of code code.org usually crashes during that time and so does most of those web pages so if that happens just keep in mind their progress will not be safe so that's why we kind of suggest you do a teacher trial but totally up to you so they'll progress linearly through these coding concepts all the while this is reporting back to you you'll see we got a star score so three stars shortest most concise two stars and extra step and one star i like to say are the struggle busters and so that will happen that way and once they get to the end of the concept it increases in complexity and they learn harder concepts as they progress through here they're working with um if and else statements and tying those all in together there so pretty fun um way to to do that so let's look at our space monkey course space adventure so we can see that newest course here and in this course everything always starts out with a story line gordo here is a teacher assistant just like in coding adventure here we'll see that we need to program him to move up so he's floating in space so instead of stepping he's moving and so these buttons are really great because they also type out for students and so that you're not slowing students down by how they're coding you know by the spelling or functionalities of that as well so that is our space adventure course and by the time he gets to the end gordo is also giving some tips along the way as well and as he works along through that's also reporting if you have an account on the teacher side of things so i'll show you that and i'm going to show you one more course and then we're going to get into q a i see we have lots of questions so i want to be able to molly that's yes are you able to change that no okay okay so um actually yeah you do want you do want that okay so um i have my classes set up and i'm gonna oops sorry i did want to show you one more course that will the game builder and the space the moon lander will look similar but let's go into the moon lander as in the as in the how it looks is exactly the same you'll see the instructions on the left hand side scripting on the middle and you're playing and creating on the right hand side so we do say this is for more advanced as you see the concepts here are are a little bit more challenging with velocity you see a little bit more curly brackets and different things like that that are happening you basically have to get this by adjusting the velocity in the thrust you have to get this moon lander onto its pad so you'll see that this is for a more advanced coater and as the students are working through these will highlight for them and tell them how far they progress so if they like i mentioned if they don't have an account something happens it goes down they'll will have to start over from the beginning so those are all there for you to be able to use and because we're getting short on time i want to show you a little bit more functionalities and if you want to see more of the courses we can do that during the q and a um so here in the teacher resources when you have an account all the lesson plans are located here for you but i want to show you something specific is the solutions are located here so you have access to all the solutions for all of the hour of code courses all you have to do is select the course and when you do it will pull up a threestar solution for whichever challenge the students are working on so that's something to also keep in mind on the hour of code page there is a place for students to print out certificates we do have the certificates located here they are also in the media kit so in case you need those i recommend taking those certificates doing a program like autocrat where you have the student creating a google form and attaching it and then it will auto generate it for your students unless you have a small amount of students it's easier to print those out but we all know students love certificates no matter how old they are and then we'll get into the my classrooms side of things so i have seen a few questions about how students sign on do we have single signon we do we have um students can log in using single signon through clevver or classlink they can also log in with their google accounts it's really easy to add a class code you you just share the class code with them and they're able to log in as they're able to log in that way or we do have a google classroom integration where you can just straight import that for your students um so there are some different variabilities for that if you're interested in that i would recommend going to our help center and there is a getting started guide for teachers and i would just recommend checking that out for that since we are just more so fast and furious at this time right now another thing is when i'm in my classroom there is this progress page and the progress page contains all the student data so i just wanted to quick mention that all the teacher all this all of the teacher solutions are along the top and then every single star shows you exactly how the students did that so this is a way if you're doing this in person or virtually you could post up this progress page and it reports in real time those stars when we work through on those challenges are being reported right here um in the progress page so it's just a really good way to host that virtual hour of code event so the students can see it and it also gives them a little bit of competition as well and if you can sort by progress to to see those students that are on struggle busing if you're interested about learning anything more about these functionalities we have some really great webinars on our webinar page that we'll talk through all of these it's how to set up and manage your classroom i would recommend checking that out okay so i know that was fast and furious meant to be fast and furious so what are some things that you need to prep and i want to leave time for our q a what are some things that you need to prep i'm definitely doing your certificates like i mentioned um doing some selfgenerated so you download the template and then you put it in a program like autocrat it's free to use you just the students will fill out their name and maybe the date and it'll populate and send it to them or send you can have it just send to you and you can download files and you'll have them right there for you easy to print and easy to share um i always highly recommend testing out beforehand i know that no matter if you're it or in person sometimes connection can be an issue sometimes it could be something especially with an ipad ipads are tricky especially if they're not most recently updated you know even with your phone there's a new release it gets slower those types of things so just those things to keep in mind as well and then giving your students logins beforehand is important you don't have to but if you would like to it's always important to create that before the hour code so they spend as much time coding as possible that's what we want to have happen so some things to consider for virtual versus in person is in person and virtual no matter what you have to plan plan plan plan plan so making sure you planned out the activities that you want the students to to be working with if you're doing in person i always suggest rotations so doing some plugged in activities and doing unplugged activities i like to do those throughout the week if you're doing virtual you can also do unplugged activities as well you can give students an activity i'll share this on the next one where you can find some unplugged activities you can have them share it via flipgrid or make their own slide deck of showing students how to do an unplugged activity maybe you take one of the puzzles from code monkey's web page you put it in your google classroom and you have the students tell you how they would solve it using those code cues from the bottom so those are just some different ways to do in person first virtual unplugged activities and i see a lot of people asking me if this slide deck will be available well this will be posted on the youtube channel underneath in the notes we always share the notes there for you so code monkey we do have some unplugged activities you can find that on the blog page actually some really great unplugged activities for you to utilize during this time whether in person or virtual um csm plugged is one of my favorites obviously everyone knows code.org has them as well another one that is really great is barefoot computing they have some really great unplugged activities like hand washing that's an algorithm so a lot of really great computer science resources for your students they are more along the primary range so just keep that in mind but we will share this out in the notes within the webinar as well that was fast and furious so we talked about the hour of code code monkey stories how to find us our newest course the space monkey course or space adventure what are our code courses are setting up for the hour of code hour of code courses our technical requirements the teacher notes where you can find those we explored some of the courses and now we're going to do some things for q a paige she's one of our teacher ambassadors she has been sharing with you that we also do have a code monkey super fans group we really encourage you to collaborate with one another as well and i see molly shared some information regarding the hour of code for you as well and then there are just some really great questions do students have to log in to access the hour of code courses they don't up to you about the teacher trial so the teacher trial is a hundred students but it's only a trial for 30 days so um that is there for you we just extended that used to only be 30 so that's exciting and we also had another question is will can you share your classroom with another teacher you can within the classrooms page we have some really great resources in our help center so let me just show you how to do that so if you have an account even if you don't in the help center down here you can type in i would recommend checking out this getting started for teachers guide here it has everything you need to know how to add student accounts how to create classrooms how to share your classroom how to set up a coteacher which is how you would share your classroom so that's a really good one to know as well will this be available it will on our webinars page and via youtube so i hope that is something that you're able to check out as well we'll also send out a recording more than likely tomorrow for you guys to be able to view that what is the best way to advocate for code monkey during our code week through code.org or through codemonkey's website um the hour of code actually if you do it through here it does take you straight to our code and monkey page so really either one works for us it'll just take you directly it's just another way to take you to that page if you can't remember how to get there do we have anything for fourth and fifth graders for hour of code we do on the hour of code page let me just get there really quickly i mentioned this i mentioned this as well but coding adventure dota does math the game builder those are all really good for fourth and fifth grade we do have if your students have a little bit more experience um then then you could do the banana tails as well but i would just recommend sticking with those ones for now um you're on the hour of code website and it looks like there are five that include grade five okay great yeah so there are quite a few activities that are there it's now code.org has it laid out a little bit easier for you to kind of navigate we do have it like i mentioned on rs2 on the main code monkey hour of code page as well does it work with google signin we do work with google signin the students can have a classroom code or um you can also import your google classroom as well um can multiple teachers collaborate and be oneonone which i just answered that can you share the unplugged activities website as well yes i will share the slide deck in the youtube notes so i just saw somebody ask me for the url for this specific one and won't be uploaded until we're finished but they're there but otherwise we do have this webinars page or you can find us on youtube we do have a playlist that's just teacher webinars um there will be a certificate following today's webinar so as soon as you as soon as we finish this and you're out of here there will be a survey sent to you and you'll fill it out and you should get an email with your certificate um before that as well okay i see some really great questions molly or brett is there anything that i missed uh which activities i see this one question which activities are best for middle school students grades k through sorry grades six through eight i definitely recommend um the space adventure for the older ones i also would recommend let me just go to our main page the game builder but having them play coding adventure first is going to be important especially i don't know how much exposure they have to coding themselves and the trivia chat bot as well so these right here you'll see it says grade six plus so these ones here on the bottom are really going to be your bread and butter and the banana tails as well molly or brett is there anything else that i missed no okay so i know there was a lot of questions um m harris i see that you're asking a question if you teach more than 100 students we're happy to follow up with you um via email after today's event um so as always we just want to thank you guys so much we want to honor your time we said half an hour so we're going over a few minutes over but we just want to thank you guys so much for joining us during today's event and all of the great questions that you have surrounding this surrounding the hour of code if you have followup questions please feel free to reach out to us um and oh one thing i just wanted to mention is we are having two hour of code events next week for students um so we invite you to ask your students both of our founders jonathan the two brothers are each hosting their own webinar telling their own stories about how they became coders and their story and we are doing a live q a session with students so if you haven't done that you can find that also on the webinars page you can register for that right there and so we're excited to share that with students as well how code can translate beyond just the walls of the classroom um so once again thank you guys so much if you enjoyed this webinar like us on facebook and all of our social media accounts please tag us in any photos or any pictures that you have with your hour of code event in your room we want to share it out and celebrate you and all the work that you're doing and we just want to thank you guys so much for taking this time today remember to write code catch bananas and save the world we'll see you guys next time bye
