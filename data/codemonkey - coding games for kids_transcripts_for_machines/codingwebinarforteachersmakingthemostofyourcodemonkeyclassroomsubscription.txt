joining us today we really appreciate you taking the time to share with us uh this 45 minutes where we're gonna try to cover as much as possible from the code monkey platform and we know you're joining us from around the world and the i want to thank you on behalf of not only myself but the code monkey team and we know that your time is limited so we really appreciate uh you for joining us today um so our goal today would be to to get to get you what you need uh from this webinar today so you can hit hit the ground running when you start teaching um so you might be looking uh to learn a little bit more about the platform you might want to get more familiarized with the platform and mainly we want to be able to hear from you also on this webinar um so we're going to give you the opportunity at the end of the webinar we're gonna hand over the mic and let you ask us some questions uh live so we won't be able to answer everyone's questions of course but i do hope that the

using the chat box and the q a box right here in this uh zoom uh webinar and also i will show you how you can contact us uh while you're on the platform so again welcome everyone today is the quarterly quarterly webinar for teachers and i really like to think about it as sort of an open office hours because it's really designed to answer your questions and then we're just here to prepare to prepare you for the classroom show you some features and we really love seeing everyone and all of you here so uh just so you can just so you know you can always follow us at codemonkey.sdu on our twitter facebook instagram and also on linkedin and then uh we also have our cod monk monkey blog so i would recommend following that as well and there's a lot of tips and tricks for teachers over there uh sometimes we'll just share some different content so we can dive into that later um but if you guys like to check out any of our social platforms then that would be great um you're also able to ask and if you have any questions that weren't answered during this webinar today then you're able to ask them through any of those uh platforms so let's take a second to meet the team uh so i'm maya maya miller i'm the customer success manager what i do is i help teachers schools districts and our uh partners to uh on board to code monkey implement them and reach their goals and throughout the school year i talk to a lot of teachers throughout my start my daily routine and i get a lot of really interesting tips and tricks some which i'm gonna share from you and share with you today not all of those tips and tricks are necessarily things that we thought of when we created the platform so it's always great to get feedback from you on how you use the platform eventually in your classroom we also have uh um leave not first kovitz here today she is the content developer and pedagogy manager and she is actually the one that works her magic and creates all of code monkey so pretty amazing and molly would you like to present yourself or okay i don't know if she's able to but i will say molly is our director of sales some of you may know her so so our objectives today in this webinar is to um show you how you can create access the classroom and how your students can access the classroom how you can create the classroom for them how to add coteachers how to limit students progress and also how to track it and i will show you the lessons feature and the gradebook and proficiency reports and we'll also have a q a in the end so just a little something that i like to say is that i see the code monkey platform in a way sort of like a restaurant right because uh when you go to a restaurant the first the first thing that you would do is take your customers and take them to their table this is basically the student access and getting the students into the classrooms and then you have to cater them with some sort of service and you're also you're able to do it yourself as a teacher or add a coteacher catering them with a service is just like showing them the um sharing with them the content the club monkey has so allowing them to pay and limit their progress and then afterwards after the food is served then you would ask how is the food was it good you would see if they ate everything on their plate or not this is part of the progress tracking that i will share with you today so for me it's just like a kind of cute way to remember uh things i hope it helps you too um so just in general uh i'm gonna cover this really briefly so co monkey is a leading fun and intuitive curriculum for kids to learn coding uh through the game and projectbased courses students as young as seven use real programming languages to solve puzzles and build games and apps so the majority of code monkey's courses do not require prior coding experience uh in order to teach them which is amazing it's a very very teacher friendly platform and all of the courses are designed for school extracurricular and home use so our mission i would say is to provide an inclusive path for youngsters into the ever expanding world of code um code monkey is a gamebased learning environment where children learn to code in real programming languages ever since codeman so you are uh you will be able to find this webinar and also many other webinars that are teacher and student geared right here if you follow this link www dot webinars so this once we finish once we end this webinar today we will be sending you a feedback survey which will also have a link to this webinar and about a week after i believe that we will already have this webinar on site so let's dive in directly to the platform or you know what let's start here can you see the login screen right now want to make sure no we see the courses page man okay okay so this is the common key login screen this is where you would probably start your way with codemonkey uh we recommend using one of the ssos if you're using codemonkey with google classroom then you would go with the google sso if you're using it with clever then you would use the clever sso and this is just the main uh screen and once you do log in this is the page that you will see uh you will get to the courses page this is a teacher account that i created especially for this webinar but this is what's unique about this page is that the students and the teachers it gives us they have the same main page so you as a teacher you're seeing this and you're also able to play the courses but this you're also seeing cool monkey the way that your students will see code monkey um okay so on the courses page you uh you can see that the courses are tagged by colors and there's novice beginner intermediate advent and advanced courses uh each course uh would be suitable for a different stage or a different grade and you can also see when you click on a certain course an explanation i mean a you can see the name of the course b whether it was started or not and then an explanation about what they would see in this course so when a student logs in for the first time they would see here start coding but once they have played their first challenge then it will turn into continue quoting and when they click it it will take them exactly to the point where they stopped last okay so on the left hand you can see that you have this menu that will help you to navigate throughout the platform and you also have another menu on the right hand that will take you to it will be able to change language from there you can go to your classrooms which is this page that we're on right now and you can go to your account to change account settings and you're also able to go to the help center or blog and contact us with this right hand menu so under my classrooms you can you once you populate your subscription with classrooms then you will be able to see the classroom list it also provides you with uh a summary of this like an overview summary of where where your subscription stands uh like student population wise so we can see that this subscription has five classrooms among all those classrooms there's 36 students some of the classrooms are populated and some aren't and you can see which subscription it it's associated with you can see that one classroom is associated with and subscription that has been expired this i will show you later i want to use this to show you how we move from year to year uh in code monkey and class code is one of the ways that you can invite students into your classroom and from this my classrooms page you're able to edit the classroom name and the classroom grade as a teacher you are also able to archive classrooms so that's just by clicking the archive button here so let's just click archive and and it will not archive immediately it will make sure that you are that you're sure and then once i have archived it let's say i archive the classroom by mistake or i wanted to archive just one student from that classroom and that the whole classroom i know this is a repeating question that we get uh once in a while so you can on the same page on as uh the classroom list there's also the archive and you can easily restore the classroom by just clicking restore classroom okay so when your first step with chrome monkey would be to create a new classroom right so we have several ways that you can create a classroom with you can create a classroom just name it here and associate it with the subscription the teacher trial uh is some of you may have uh wanted to dab around code monkey so you had a teacher trial before so make sure that you're adding the classroom to the correct and active subscription and another way that you can create a classroom is import from google so right now i am not connected to my google classroom account but if i was then it would once i choose the check box import from google then a drop down menu will appear here and it will show me all of the classrooms that are um classrooms that i manage with google and the important thing to notice is uh just make sure that your login email to code monkey is the same as your login email to your google classroom and then maya just just one comment you um if you log in with clever it will say import form clever and right will import all your classes from cleveland okay that's that's correct thank you leave that and once classrooms are uh imported from either clever or google when we get into the specific classroom there will be an icon here right below the drop down menu that enables you to navigate between classrooms easily without having to go back to the my classrooms page so there will be uh a button here that looks like with the branding of either google or clever and once you click that button it will automatically sync the classroom with whatever um students or changes that you had on your google or clever classroom so by clicking by choosing a classroom i it will take actually sorry i want it okay so once you chose the classroom you we move from the like the main hall of the teacher dashboards to the to the dashboard of the specific classroom on the dashboard of the specific classroom we have those tabs and each tab has a world of possibilities and again the drop down menu is always here on the top right hand side you can change classroom easily you don't have to go back to the my classrooms every time because we know it can be exhausting so once you chose uh the specific classroom we get to the progress tab on the progress tab we're able to um monitor and control the progress of our students uh so i can currently we're looking at the coding adventure part one course of this classroom you can see uh the names of the students and we are you're able to sort in a way that you're most comfortable so you can either sort by name like it is sort of right now from by display name or by progress and then it will show you uh the mo the ones who made the most progress at the top and then going down to those who have less progress and the the star system as you can see here in the on the top a yellow star means three stars this means that the student was able to solve the the challenge in the best most elegant and shortest way uh a blue star means that he he submitted a twostar solution which means that they uh were able to reach the bananas but maybe there was like a step that was making it uh that could have been uh saved and once signs and that this they have struggled with this and an exclamation mark means a failed solution so they weren't able to solve the challenge at all and assessment challenges this is actually first look uh i wanted to show you that we currently we currently have assessment challenges here marked as with a yellow circle but we are working on special assessment challenges that will be separated from this which is something that i know a lot of teachers are really excited about um so on the progress table you're also able to limit progress as you can see here uh this classroom's progress was limited until to challenge 24 the one of the assessment challenges it's it's a choice you can limit by course you can limit by assessment challenges and and from the progress table you're also able to turn on turn on and off super hints for your students if you feel that your students are struggling for example if we see uh hi joanne so if we see that uh this is a great visual indication to see if our students struggled in a certain point so if i would see several students have blue or red stars in a certain challenge then i know maybe it's time to turn on super hints for them or maybe i want to revisit that challenge and see why they were struggling um okay wait so i think i jumped a little bit ahead i also wanted to before we jump into the classroom i wanted to say that if you are not importing with google classroom or clever or whatever uh free premade uh classroom then once you've created a classroom uh let's go to one of my empty classrooms this thing's always tend to happen when you're in a webinar sometimes uh one class wouldn't work let's see if this works no okay so if this classroom wasn't populated then we would not see the list of the students which means that we need to add students so once you click the plus and ends and add students the popup window and you will be able to add a single account or create multiple accounts and a single account is pretty obvious display name using password uh create multiple accounts so to do that you would need to download this and afterwards enter the info into that example file there are examples on the file so you won't have to um imagine uh how you have to fill this csv and then upload that csv into the platform and once you've uploaded it then the students will be populated in the classroom and uh you're getting uh first look this is the first webinar where we're presenting this so it's exciting uh you are also able to share a class code with your students a class code means so for example the classroom called adventures encoding has this unique class code that i can refresh and change and by clicking the regenerate button so by sharing a class code i can restrict or limit and how students will join because i know that some of the creators but mainly prereaders but not only uh could sometimes get confused then because you remember the login screen that i showed you at first so there are many sso systems so if you choose for example google or clever or classlink or whatever then it will present to those students only that option and it will prevent them from getting confused while they are blog signing in for the first time uh so once you shared the class code with the students they will you're basically um passing on that process to them you've shared the class talk with them and now they have to just click the link that you've shared with them and populate themselves into the classroom when can you change this after the code was already made so again if you even if the if for example you're actually seeing the uh perfect example right now this is a classroom which is already populated but i can still regenerate the class code again and again endlessly i think if i'm not mistaken so you're always able to change the classroom code and if by any chance the classroom code reached a student that is not meant to be in this classroom then you're always able to move this student to a different classroom the thing is that you're only able to move students within classrooms in your subscription and if i'm not mistaken only classrooms that you manage so and another great feature is the student log inputs right here at the top and so the student student logging cards are basically just uh individual cards for students that have their name and their just their credentials their login information this is really helpful if you're teaching a hybrid model or if you're teaching um remotely and you can i it does create a little bit work for the teacher because after you printed the login cards you have to share them with a specific student so it would either be print and cut or screenshot and share and but it does really help a lot of students log in correctly and that saves a lot of work later on okay so let's move on to the next step on the courses tab you're able to see uh the the same courses as we saw here but now we're seeing them with uh a little bit more information so we see which grades this course is suitable for how many lesson plans it has and what um advice it would work best on from the courses page you're able to assign or unassign courses from the classroom so i would assign by clicking it and it becomes yellow which means the sign and to unassign i just click the arrow and i'm assigned pretty intuitive and for every course if you click the read more it will give you an explanation on what are the coding concepts that are uh covered in this lesson and you have a link here that would take you to the lesson plan i will eat the lesson plans are let's let's just give it a second to vlog so the lesson plans is a presentation a premade presentation by uh by league nut that will help you teach the course in the classroom so you we basically did all the work and you can just rip rip up the fruits by using this presentation when you use uh in front of the students when you use code monkey in the classrooms or in zoom you can share your screen and now is there anything else i want to say and again you can see that it's color coded by uh how how difficult uh the the course is so on the gradebook the gradebook is another pretty great feature uh so on the gradebook you are able to see some data about uh about your specific classroom in a specific course you're able to navigate between courses here and between classrooms here you will be able to see uh the the the star and the star system translated into numbers from 1 to 10 and it's like just grading them and you're able to change it from numbers to letters or to percents and so the percent is how how how successful were they in completing this course and you're also able to choose if you want to see the overall grade for a different okay this class hasn't covered all of that but uh you're able to change the the concept and this uh chart is also exp if you click export it would download as a it would be downloaded to your computer and euro can download certificates from here which is a great way to ramp up the excitement in the classroom so once you've finished uh coding adventure part one you can download certificates and the certificates would be done would be uh let's show you what they would look like so the certificates would be downloaded into your computer with the name of the student imprinted in the same font as codemonkey and let's see if i can see it here okay so let's see answer okay so this is an example for a certificate if you download it through the teacher resources then it's without a name but if you download it with the teacher resources so it will include an issue date student name and the signature or the founder of codemonkey so before we move on to the teacher resources officially i just wanted to show you briefly the showroom the showroom is where you would be able to see uh games that were created by your students and once you once you reach the point where the students are using the the more advanced quad monkey courses you're also able to enable or disable the discover so once right now the discovery is enabled so that's why it says the button says disable discover and once i click it it says that it will hide the discover from my students i really recommend uh maybe disabling discover for the first uh for the first month at least and it's just it's a personal recommendation it's not an official recommendation from code monkey but i think the discovery is a really students could get distracted by it and instead of doing the assigned courses then they might move to the discover so i would recommend once you have once you have created a classroom added students and then assigned courses the next step i think would be to disable this cover and then enable it as you go on but it's at your desk at your description so when we let's move on to the teacher resources so under the teacher resources uh you have always available the webinars this webinar also is going to be on the webinar page so whenever you want to revisit anything you can do it from here you can see uh the lesson plans uh on so the teacher resources would be obviously where you get all of your resources and the resources are directed for online activities offline activities and preparation for the classroom so if you're interested in preparation for the classroom then i would recommend looking at the lesson plans that are available for code mckee junior for beaver retriever recording adventure game builder banana tales pony chat and challenge builder and also for the preparation for classroom you can check out the very cool new feature coding concepts it's relevant only for coding adventure and but you're able to see brief uh videos that you're also i would recommend showing in the classroom uh later on and that will explain the specific coding concepts that will be taught in that course if you're interested in offline and one more preparation for the classroom you can see the solutions for every challenge in every course in code monkey all of the solutions are here all you need to do is click the the link in the correct course and then it will show you the the most eloquent way to solve the challenge and this is what you would be um directing your classroom towards if you're interested in offline activities then we have the media and graphics and you can find certificates here you can find coloring pages and posters you can print and hang in the classroom and what else did i want to say and if you click the teaching with coding adventure then it would take you there's a lot of windows open right now and i'm presenting my screen so it may take a second okay great so it will take you to the teaching with coding your page which has a lot of information about the about the different uh coding concepts that are covered and also a course overview and brief introduction to the platform uh so before i i know i do want to respect everyone's time and i know that the webinar is due to finish in a couple of minutes so i just want to uh briefly review uh where you can access the help center so you help center logo is always here on the left in the bottom left hand you're also able to contact us again as i mentioned at the beginning through here and okay let's just see the help center structure for a minute because i want you to be able to find your way once you use it for the first time so the help center is divided by articles for teachers articles for admins and articles for teachers and admins so this would be things relating to classroom classroom dashboard management articles for students which is basically text explanations on how to log in as a student and then frequently ask questions and dive deeper articles about the courses and okay so let's let's do a brief q a before we finish so we see that we have one question from jennifer hi jennifer let me just read it for a second okay because it's a sorry maya i will um i will check the health center and we'll get back to jennifer with the with the issue with it it means that they instead of using the class code they try to sign up maybe there weren't enough seats on your account so they couldn't join with the class code or maybe they entered the wrong class code so they tried to sign up students and then they had to enter their age and if their age is 13 or less which i assume it is then they get this message that they are not um old enough to join so but i will check the your um um your conversation uh on the help desk and now on the support and then i will get back to you right after this webinar thank you jennifer says thank you as well if anybody has any questions then if you could please either raise your hand or write them in the chat let's give people a second to write something if they need to okay so if nobody has any further questions then i think uh we can wrap this webinar up and i'll just remind everybody that this webinar was recorded and it will be will be live on our website uh within a week or so you will be able to access it through the teacher resources and let's just show you through the teacher resources if you click the visit webinar page you're also able to find on the webinar page a lot of uh um previously recorded webinars that are uh dealing with either specific subjects or general uh getting started with teacher getting started with code monkey for teachers explanations and also for students and and i want to thank everybody again for joining us today thank you for taking the time and please if any any of the questions are remained unanswered then you can always talk to us through the help center or by using the chat bot that for some reason i can't see it right now but it's always on the bottom right hand right here and there's a chat bot and you can write to our support center we enter within a day or two maximum so thank you for joining today i'm very happy to meet all of you and have a great rest of your day
