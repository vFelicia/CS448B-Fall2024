percentage of the course they have completed here on top are the challenges numbers and each star represents the student solution to that challenge most of our courses have a star scoring method for each challenge students can receive one two or three stars based on the quality of their solution here you see a breakdown of every student's score for every challenge played in coding adventure part

solution to that challenge and view the number of times they attempted the challenge by clicking on their attempt you can view their solution and work through it with the class anonymously looking for the three stars perfect solution for a challenge just click on the challenge number challenge numbers with a yellow circle indicate an assessment challenge unlike the rest of the challenges assessment challenges do not provide the students with any prebuilt code instead they will need to apply the specific learning concept that was taught in the challenges leading up to the assignment if you are looking to limit your classroom's progress within the course you can use our limit progress button with this feature you are able to limit your classroom's progress to a specific challenge number students who complete challenge 20 will get a message that the rest of the challenges have been locked by the teacher by returning to free play students can progress at their own pace the progress can also be limited by the last lesson taught this is only relevant if you are using lessons for coding adventure super hints provide extra guidance for your students and enables them to progress independently as they go through the coding adventure challenges this feature can be toggled on or off by the teacher from the progress tab by default it will be turned off super hence can either be a
