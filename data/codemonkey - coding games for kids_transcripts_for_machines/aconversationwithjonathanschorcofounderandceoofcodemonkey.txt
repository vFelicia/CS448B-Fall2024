I'm Karen your host and today I'm super excited to talk to Jonathan Shore he is the cofounder and CEO of cod monkey I'll be asking some interesting questions about heading an edtech company too so stay tuned for those interesting questions and hi Jonathan how are you good how are you Karen good could you share with us how you first learned to code and maybe how that inspired you to start Code Monkey definitely so the way I have learned to code I think I was around N9 years old me and ID do my cofounder at Code Monkey we're brothers we grew up uh in this type of home where both our parents were software Engineers so growing up with the first you know Apple Computers around uh when personal computers were still not that common so we had this amazing natural opportunity to to be exposed to coding very early on in our lives and specifically I remember my mother Sig me up to this one of sort of those like coding boot camps for kids a summer camp where she was working in the highi university and over there we've been taught coding through mit's logo uh programming language for children so there was like a little triangle on the black and white screen that you coded to draw lines using later loops and variables and functions to create more complex drawings that was uh my first I think official coding course yeah cool so early on how old were you what you think when you start I think uh this coding summer class it was when I was nine or 10 oh wow okay and um you told me a little bit about your experience hosting coding courses so did that ultimately lead to the creation of Code Monkey definitely yeah so when I graduated a year after graduating high school before going to University I had the experience of uh uh living and working inan Urban kib like an urban community of Educators in a like a development town in in the South and I was working in a school uh mainly an elementary school with mainly Children of the families who recently immigrated uh from the former Soviet Union countries afternoon uh I started in the afternoons I started my own classes of coding for kids based on the same programming language that I've used to learn logo from MIT 10 years before that but this time I was using small games to teach kids how to code I before before each class I created a small puzzle or like a small tiny game that they had to win or like progress in the game through writing simple lines of codes so that was my first experience of teaching kids to code and that was also the inspiration for Code Monkey using Game based learning uh for Computer Science Education you told me something about goats something about one of your variety of experiences in life um can you tell me a little bit more about some of the interesting things you did before you actually started Cod mon sure so this thing with the goat so that my exp so you know we grew up in this home um both our parents sort of like TCH entrepreneurs in the software space so I always knew that I'm going to study computer science in the Israel Institute of Technology and that I'll probably do something with tech for a living but then I had this experience of of of working with children in education it was really lifechanging was trying to I was trying to to start this company of uh creating online coding games for kids but it was just too early early in when I graduated uh from University the year was I think 2006 or I tried to start a company uh with a friend of mine isai who later also became a cofounder of Code Monkey but it was too early teaching kids to code wasn't a big thing still back then so we tried for a whole year we failed 2008 came which was also like this big financial crunch in the United States so wasn't a good time to insist how did you over how did you overcome those like doubts you know of it failing and then you have like did you want to just give up how did you get how did you inspire yourself I guess to keep going good question uh so my partner isai has also been like my best friend we we grew up together from first grade coding together as kids and playing computer games and and you know doing math and all all the things that we like when we started it he said well okay let's try let's give it like one year 12 months see if it takes off or not he's this more like Risk adver first person I guess so he had to like you know yeah exactly exactly so so it was I guess thanks to him you know after 12 months we decided to move on but that was actually you know that was that that that is that's one of the things that led to the goats experience because then I you know I was I had my my degree in computer science you know I was working as a software engineer uh but I had this more recent passion for education I couldn't find a way to combine both of those things but I I kept the job of software engineering a parttime job and then also product management and leading uh software teams and and and managing software products but I was starting all kind of of uh nonprofit uh education ventures in parallel to that and the the most recent one was this goat farm uh which was actually a place to to work with children that had like severe emotional issues they would come and you know just work with us in this farm that was yeah but but it was a real dairy farm like we milk the goat we we made you know we created like all kind of dairy products and sold them and we were walking the goats like every day for five hours in the forest it was it was cool it's good it's good to do other things you know it all kind of feeds into even even something like farming probably gave you some experience to help you I don't know I don't know what that is it did it did yeah yeah once you started uh the beginnings of cod monkey did you feel like there was something missing from coding education that you wanted to fill in yeah so my experience starting those coding courses for kids that given the these very simple like small games coding games like I was amazed by by how fast kids learn yeah something that back then was consider very abstract and and hard to understand the year was 2001 I think so you know once you make it sort of you enable this experience and it's really not that complicated to do it then many children if not all of them can pretty can very easily uh grasp those abstract Concepts they can even almost sort of do it do it on themselves on their owns given the right you know interactive online content so so the vision was to to enable this experience online that and make it accessible to children all over the world even in places where there are no computer science teachers available in in elementary schools and you know children that didn't have this opportunity to grow up in a home where you know both parents are intact uh so really just to to enable this experience uh for children everywhere and how do you get them to stick with it because you know like any game you know even if it's just a and not a learning game um engagement is key so what does Code Monkey do to kind of make them stay motivated right so so so there are two aspects to that that's a very important question like longterm engagement so one part is what we try to do at Code Monkey you know we do our best to support that engagement longterm engagement and the way we do it Code Monkey is by providing sort of this consistent game word and game experience with the consistent theme of animals and the same character that hopefully you get attached to in a storyline with a villain and you know all of the other classic methods to create longterm uh engagement to in gaming but we found out after starting code monkey that this is not enough and in order to really keep the children on board through the more difficult uh stages of learning when it gets to functions or other computer science concept that are a bit a bit more difficult to to comprehend it is key to have either a parent or a teacher around to provide that I don't know I would say emotional support or push or I don't know or like this yeah because eventually you know we're social creatures and and we need to to sort of climb this steeper obstacle I think uh the motivation you know it has to be also social it can be provided also by peers you know other students in the classroom but in order to to maintain this this I think steady environment of group of children learning and overcoming obstacles even when it comes you know it comes a little bit harder you need adults to create these settings and and stabilize it so we've learned you know that there's there's a lot we can do with with with game design to to help the engagement but eventually also the responsibility of the adults around around the learner the children to to create this supporting environment a steady supporting environment and I like what we're doing now with the Discover profile where the kids are a little bit more involved like how many likes did I get you know on their game creations and they can share and a little bit it's important and that's also a social motivation so yeah I think that's key right okay so now turning it to a little bit more personal questions just besides going boat farming if you weren't leading Code Monkey what would you be doing oh that's a hard question I don't know I was very passionate about math like probably I would enjoy doing something with that but then also math is very theoretical and I do enjoy having sort of impact on the world around me like direct impact so I don't know maybe I would be teaching math maybe but are you happy what you chose in the end are you glad that you you're doing what you're doing yeah code monke is perfect for me it's like combining both my passions for you know having this social impact but also being creative with technology and science um yeah and um as CEO what would you say is your biggest ongoing challenges um biggest ongoing challenges as CEO of Code Monkey I would say it's also uh goes back it's funny to the same the same challenge in in education of creating this longterm engagement but this time I'm talking about engagement of of of the people working with me and even myself you know we've been doing Cod monkey now for 10 years almost you know it's a long hole and it's a it's a slow process of sort of creating this transformation public education systems and you know there was this big hype of teaching kids to code when we started Code Monkey but you know the hype moves on and now people are excited about different things but but we still need to stay like focused and engaged with this same ision now for for a decade and more decades I hope in the future so and Challenge and evolve the main challenge I guess is is to to keep this excitement alive for the long term keep the people motivated focused on the same task sort of finding new challenges uh within this scope of what we're doing and evolve yeah um beyond your professional life what hobbies and activities do you enjoy that help you recharge and stay Balan I know you do a couple of things I do a couple well Sports is important like uh I found that you know sport you know became from a hobby to something that like I have to do every week like several times to keep energy levels high so I swim and uh I play tennis I snowboard when I can like in the winter music is important we're playing tonight actually me and Ido and other people that we used to play music with uh before we started cold monkey so we're trying to relaunch that now it's important it's yeah I would say Sport and music and and friends you know keeping like a small group of very close friends really helps you know going through challenges in life so this is very important to me my friendships my relationship with my close friends right if you're balanced in your personal life you can be balanced at work yeah nobody wants grumpy Karen that didn't work out for two weeks work oh it really does yeah um especially when you are doing something like sitting at a computer you know and cing or what I do marketing yeah you need those Outlets too definitely and last question looking back what advice would you give to your younger self for your future path as an entrepreneur what advice would I give to my younger self uh as an entrepreneur uh so it's about like I think what you asked it's about I I would say watching out like keeping this balance in life I think I wasn't aware of that when starting cold monkey like I was so happy that you know finally I felt like the timing is right uh to start Cod monkey and everyone are now interested about this idea that I had and it's going on it's working so well you become I became so excited with it that uh you lose this balance and and you don't uh you don't I didn't remember like you know I became so enthusiastic with code monkey and I sort of forgot about those other aspects in my life personal life Social Life Family Sports hobbies and I didn't make sure to to to keep you know investing in those things to to to stay balanced and you know luckily we were we were successful quickly enough with code monkey and the company got acquired like just four years after we started it so it allowed me allowed me maybe five years after we started it allowed me to to reconnect with those other aspects in my life and rebalance but you know yeah if I could give an advice to my younger self would it would be like not not to lose this balance in the first place yeah super important and do you think we're do you think we're building Future Leaders at code monke with our definitely yeah it's exciting one of the yeah and one of the benefits of you know doing it like for 10 years now that I actually run into people that are now working intact remember Cod monkey giving them their first experience you know with coding yeah so that's very exciting I don't know about leaders like maybe it's too early but definitely we've inspired people into Tech careers children and I think also the story of cold monkey you know here in Tel Aviv uh it's it was a very outstanding success maybe like the first big success in the field for a startup in the field of Education Technologies so I think we've inspired entrepreneur this way definitely I have a lot of tech entrepreneur is coming to talk with me you know visiting the Cod monkey office and asking for advice and definitely Cod monkey success as a startup inspired them to to go on their own Tech Ventures yeah for sure well um thank you so much Jonathan you were amazing you gave some really good advice and interesting uh backstory of how things that I never heard before and our listeners will um probably learn from so thank you for being the most amazing guest and our first guest on the Code Monkey banan cast sure and um come back again um it would be great you wrote a great article about chat GPT and Ai and does that make coding obsolete so I'd like to talk to you actually on the podcast about that because that's really interesting to people so we can talk about that another time and um if anyone has topics you would like to explore in future episodes or would like to be a guest just tag us at Cod Monkey St that's Code Monkey Studios um with your message on Twitter X or any other platform that we have and I'll respond to you um subscribe like share all that good stuff and don't forget say it with me Jonathan code catch bananas bananas save the world
