hi my name is Benjamin Edward I'm a Nigerian I'm 24 years old I am I'm trying to become a web developer in frontend full stack developing and I'm currently doing HTML CSS and with that with time I'm trying to start up with JavaScript and for now CSS is still kind of difficult but you know there's no obstacles we can if you just tell me to overcome um initially I I was an administrative musical Administrative Assistant back in Nigeria and I did some odd Works which is usually someone who um who is a graduate wouldn't want to do but you know with time we see that Tech is the future and you have to you have to go into the flow and develop yourself for the future because the future is Tech because AI is taking place and you know and now I'm trying to learn and develop in the experts development um yeah because programming itself it's a field where you can program what's in your mind like you want to design a particular um let's let's take a website for instance you want to design a website and a particular layout that is in your mind you can use programming to arrange the layer at how you want it to be and you can program you make programming at what any design you want so programming itself is creativity programming in English is not a program problem for me because Nigeria is an Englishspeaking country by officially because we were colonized by the British so we all speak English and right from there to speak English so English is nothing but if we are in a country where it doesn't speak English you can also learn with the words it's not that serious because when you're learning it's same um coding line so you can practice it when you over view the tutorials one two three times you must die you don't have to learn how to speak English yes it's something you can learn so my long time ago in programming I I want to find myself in the security architecture where I can be among the expertise that are trying to solve security issues by using programming programming is not that's really scary but when you just starts you might feel oh it's scary but when you do it once two three times you see that yes it's kind of friendly but you just have to devote more time and but when you say okay you you're programming and um you say that the video having a headache or something you can just okay take a break programming is not that difficult awesome okay thank you so much Benjamin you're welcome good luck in your future and thanks for taking the time to interview with us
