so today is the office hours webinar for teachers i really like to think about it as open office hours because it is really designed to answer your questions and then we're just here to pepper in a couple of new features love seeing all the people that are joining us we have people from all over from ohio to morocco and all the way um across the united states so it's really great to see everyone joining us from everywhere um so you can always follow us at codemonkeystu on our twitter facebook instagram we also are on linkedin as well and then we also have our code monkey blog so we recommend following us there for teacher tips and tricks sometimes we'll just share some different content so we can dive into that later if you guys would like to check that out as well um and if you want to tweet at us at all we're a small group here but you can always tweet us live during today's webinar if we aren't able to get with you during the webinar we'll follow directly after all right so now it's time to meet the team so my name is lena sololei and i'm the professional development and sales manager here at code monkey i've been with a company almost about three years now and prior to that i spent over 10 years in the classroom in a multitude of different roles so i've been where you are and now i'm on the opposite side helping really make your our goals really make your lives a little bit easier now let my colleague introduce herself hi everyone i'm molly i am at the director of sales um i have been with code monkey for about a year working from salt lake city utah and have been in edtech for just over six years now so i will be here to assist lina with answering questions on chat and on q a so please send those over as they come up all right great thank you so much molly um so today please feel free to chat with us along the side and then if you have any questions it you can also pop that into the q a box as well something that we don't get to you know during while i'm going over some of the features then we'll make sure we answer those right at the end i may stop and also um just quickly answer them if it fits where we are and if we don't answer your questions immediately during today's webinar we'll let you know that we'll follow up with you via email but we'll follow up with you directly following us and then after you finish today's webinar there will be a survey that will pop up and once you take the survey a professional development certificate will be emailed to you for an hour of professional development credit so if you guys are ready let's get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world all right so what will we be actually covering in today's webinar session we are going to go over classrooms and the student access adding coteachers limiting student pro progress the lessons feature and just some of those things that are really beneficial for both inperson and distance learning gradebook and proficiency report some of our newer features and then we're going to have some time for q a we also took q a questions from your registration as well just making sure that we are answering your burning desired questions right so now let's go ahead and we are going to show you how to um sign up as a teacher from the getgo so i'm just going to pause my screen really quick and pull up my hundreds of windows as you guys know how that goes um all right and always when you are doing zoom nothing ever pulls up exactly how you would like it to go so all right so i am just going to go ahead and sign up here as a as a teacher and just pulling the right window up here okay all right so the first thing i want to show you guys is how to log in using either signing up for an account or logging in with your google account so i personally like to use a single signon account i find that if you sync it that way it just makes it a little bit easier also who has time to remember more passwords so the first thing you'll do is you'll click on sign up i already have an existing account but i'll just show you that way you can either sign up as a student a teacher or a parent in this case that is how your students would sign up and then as a teacher you would sign up right here so in and then once you do it will bring you to the option where you can sign in with a using an email your full name password or you can sign up with a single signon option so if you have clever class link you can sign up doing it that way i recommend however your students are logging in then you would log in the same way as they do basically if you're using any functionalities of google at all google classroom any of that you would want to sign in using google or else you can't use the features of google classroom which we're going to get into here so i'm just going to go ahead and i'm going to log in using my single sign on account here and then you're just going to go ahead and you're going to put your email address and your password and then just making sure that you accept the authentication from google um interesting i didn't think that's how that was going to go but anyway so then once you do then you'll be um you'll be in to the account let me just do a new share here and once you do it'll populate you here into the classroom so we're going to get into the classroom feature so this is how you sign in just really briefly the my classrooms page is where all of your classroom information is held and so that's just going to be everything that you how you access any of your student data and any of that information there under the courses tab i'm just going to brief mention this part because it's going to be fun to see this site on the back end and the courses side is where all of the courses that are available to you you'll see that as a student they'll only see the available courses that have been assigned and at the bottom all of the courses that are not that they're not utilizing are all going to be underneath and unavailable for them what has been newly added to code monkey here are these banners across the top that talk about what type of language each of the courses are and then what level the courses are so that's just something for you to keep in mind and i'm going to show you our new feature after that and then we'll go over some of these other features here at the end just based kind of on your questions um so in the classroom this is what we call the classrooms page to create a classroom there's three ways that you can create a classroom you can click on create classroom here and you can either create a new classroom and then you just want to make sure that you select the appropriate subscription this is important when you have an active subscription just making sure that you've connected it to the correct one or you can import from google and what you'll do is you'll click connect with google classroom and then once you do so and make sure you hit all of the all that and making sure that you allow the google classroom then you'll actually have the ability to basically what it will do is straight import your students so that's important um for you to have that when it's synced together then you can have all the functionalities and it will speak between google and itself um so if i allow this to go through then you'll see that my i now have the ability to import um this one i don't have any imported classroom so let me share another screen with you and i'll show you that so you're able to pull that up like i mentioned i have so many tabs here so just give me one second okay so once you do that you'll see you have your teachers and your students here and then you'll actually just be able to work simultaneously together with one another and then those clap that classroom data will just be imported there and then when you want to do the lessons feature which i'll show you it'll populate there another way that you can do it is you can just when you create your classroom you can add students more manually so i'll kind of show you that as well so that's how you create the classrooms um so now that i've created a classroom which you can see here i'll just click on one of the classrooms that i've created this one actually will have students populated inside of it um so i create the classroom either importing it from google or just manually creating a classroom when i go directly here to the classroom i'll click on the students tab here if you've synced with google the students will just be straight rostered in here if you haven't there's a couple of ways that you can do this if you have younger students and they're not using any single signon you can create click on this classroom login url if you are synced with google and google classroom this will not pull up for you so that's just something to keep in mind and then the students will just click on their username and be able to easily import or be able to easily add their password and it's just a strike link or they can go into login at the code monkey regular home page there you can also print login url cards obviously in our new remote learning environments of the world this does doesn't necessarily work as well as you would like it to but it does have a straight direct url on here and it does tell their username and their password so you could break that up take a screenshot it's a little bit extra work for you on that side of things but if you're in person it obviously works very very great so that is how you would add students now at the bottom here um so let me just remove one of my coteachers here you'll see that you can add a coteacher so on this one specifically i'm actually not able to add a coteacher because i had both full but you would add a coteacher here if you're connected with the google classroom it will sync the it will sync the coteacher there so if you are importing with google classroom you need to make sure with whoever you're sharing your subscription with that you have added them as a coteacher on your google classroom so that you're able to import and roster with them so that is how you would do that side of things uh for adding students and so molly will actually add that easy link for you there in the chat box um so students who are joining for home or or any of that we do have how would they actually join the classrooms themselves so here you can see we have a classroom code so the students can join signing up using their username or their password and then they would just enter in this this classroom code so something that i want to show you is that in our help center i click on the three lines on the right hand side in the help center we just recently added these student login guides so this is really important oh i'm on a google classroom still okay good catch you guys i'm so sorry about that um okay well good to know my apologies about that okay so i guess you guys didn't see any of that part with the students so let me let me go back because that's um embarrassing part of that okay so here i am in the uh student list here um thanks susan yeah um so here i am in the student list and i'll go back and cover whatever it is that i might have missed at the beginning but i'm just in the classroom so how i got here is the my classrooms page i'm not sure exactly where i left the offer didn't but here's the classrooms page each one of these you can create a classroom by either importing the classroom or manually creating it the class code is also located here as well just for that instance you can click on so i created my classroom i'm going to click into my classroom and i'll just re quick go over this part because i feel like it's important when i get here i will go to the students tab so i'm in my specific classroom so that's just something to keep in mind is that i'm in the specific classroom that i want um and then i'm gonna show you how you can navigate that but here i click on the students tab at the top and if you've imported with google it will just already be here manually won't be able to change passwords or anything like that and if you want to archive or maybe a student leaves your class you'll just have a button at the top here that will say sync with the google classroom and the login url just brief show that since you didn't see that i clicked on the login url and here it shows all the student lists that i've created i've created this student list here in my student account by using a bulk import and so down here you can add students three ways either creating a single account doing multiple accounts which is how i did this because this is a teacher classroom a teacher training classroom or you can share the class code and if you share that then you're able to see it much larger new students you can click on these tabs and these will actually take you to the student guides themselves so if it's input if you're imported with google classroom you won't have this feature if you need to add the students manually this is where you'll see it and then what i was saying is down here at the bottom i have a coteacher if my classroom is synced with google classroom it will show you just to invite the teacher they must be on your google classroom to be synced with with the classroom here so it's that part is an important feature there um or you can just add people independently and what a coteacher does is basically they share the classroom with you so they see all of the classroom data of just the specific classroom they can assign courses see student progress and all of the functionalities of being a teacher on the classroom but just for that specific classroom so it's good sometimes special ed teachers or maybe you have another teacher that you want to share your your classroom with and that's also the ways that we share our subscriptions um so that is some of the functionalities and then the login cards which i was mentioning here it does print out a student individual login cards and it has a direct url a username and a password so um not so much it doesn't work so well in our new virtual world but that is there so that is how you would um add students to that classroom so brand new just released this week my most favorite most needed update that we have here is the classroom so before every time you wanted to access each and every single classroom you would have to go out to the my classrooms page click into the classroom now you can easily navigate from this nice little drop down tab and i can easily navigate between my classes i find this to be a really needed functionality and it's really great that i don't have to do extra clicking in that way so here i am so the student list that's how you add students and i just wanted to note that part and then on the courses page so i'm just going to briefly go over this course page here um so on the course page now the tiling these banners at the top match exactly what is on our courses themselves so it has the languaging it has the skill level and then it'll tell you the specific course when you assign it to the class it'll say assigned here will tell you what grade levels it's great for what devices it works best on and my most favorite part is when you click on read more it'll also tell you the coding concepts that are covered within the course and the specific lesson plans are actually attached right here for you as well so if you don't want to go back to the teacher resources you have it all right here kind of in a nifty little square everything that you need and the same is true for our coding adventure course we have the standards here which i know this is true i just caught this today it's telling you exactly what functionalities and what will be covered in the course itself lesson plans and exactly to the standards so if you're wanting to know what standards are associated these are basic standards more general standards not specific state standards are the common core standards for math and language arts or ela and then we do have the csta standards and the national curriculum standards for our international standards as well so that's a really great thing that just also got released so we're very very excited about that um okay so now since i'm unable to get into my google classroom the way that i wanted to i'm gonna talk about um i'm going to go into our gradebook tab and then i'm going to show you some features and and functionalities of our progress page so in our gradebook as students are working through the course their grades are populating here for you so it's automatically graded you can export it as a csv file if you'd like and import it if you have assigned google classroom in the lessons tab which we're going to go to you're able to edit the grade it won't automatically report this grade to the google classroom um something that we are working on but google's a little bit tricky on their back side of things but that's there and then also here we have this proficiency tab and in the proficiency tab we have this new proficiency table and it's kind of hidden as you can see here it says by course and it says by proficiency but this is basically all of the coding concepts that are covered throughout all of the courses within code monkey's curriculum and so every single one of these is a different coding concept and basically as the students get more familiarize which in each and every single concept it's going to be reporting back to them the more that they practice a skill the more advanced they will be so if they only do one course you're not going to see that they're going to be advanced in that topic it's more about extra practice um and really getting them so if they've if they worked let's say they worked with variables in coding adventure they work with variables in beaver achiever and they worked with variables in the game design courses then they will have mastered that concept so it's just the more exposure that they have to those concepts the more you'll see this chart begin to fill out um and then i'll just quick mention about the showroom here just really quickly here so in the showroom is where students games and challenges will be populated for you so once they publish it to the classroom they'll show up here something i like to know is when you disable the the discover feature so discover is a worldwide publishing platform it is heavily vetted making sure no student information is shared there's no inappropriate things laced inside of there but basically when you discover when you disable the discover for your classroom the students don't have access to this discovery they won't actually see it there at all so that's just something that i like to note i think it's important until you introduce the concept that um my own personal opinion is that they don't have exposure to that right away okay so i've showed you the functionalities of those and now i want to go into the progress page so the progress page i like to always say is a teacher's best friend um and why do i say the progress page is a teacher's best friend well all of the solutions for the solutions are located in two places but this one here is where everything is contained like the holy grail i find of everything it's broken up into by coding concepts for each and every single course along the top and green is the teacher solutions for everything so you're not hunting and every single star within the gradebook or within the progress page actually contains a student solution so you can sort this by student progress and you can do a data dive and notice a data trend so if we look here specifically at challenge 15 or challenge 16 excuse me we can see there's a lot of blue stars a three star is the shortest most concise solution that a student could have done so that's kind of the goal a two star means there was an extra step and a one star is a struggle so they really didn't understand the concept but were able to pass the challenge when you click on any one of these student solutions it will tell you how many times they attempted it and like i said you can pull it up in a real life animation it also pulls up anonymously so really good for you know debugging a challenge altogether or some whole group instruction maybe you put it up in a jam board and the students solve it in the best way that they can after you've done some like small reteaching as well but not only that you can put this up a lot of teachers will put this up in their classroom and show the students progressing through the challenges obviously up to you but the biggest feature of this page especially for synchronous and asynchronous type of learning is that you can actually limit student progress so what that means is that maybe i don't want my students to have access to anything i'm starting the i'm starting my lesson i can put limit progress to zero they won't have access to any of the content at all um until i'm ready for them so typically i like to lock this down so i don't have students progressing beyond where i am so it just kind of gives you a little bit more control there the super hints here is only available for coding adventure basically the more a student fails a challenge um then gordo will pop up with an extra hint it will guide them to the answer but doesn't give them the full answer this is really good for remote style learning i also think that if a student has failed a challenge that many times that they probably need the right extra reinforcement so i personally like to turn it on that's just my own preference um i agree that limiting the students is amazing because it just keeps everyone together and you don't have kids that are all over the place as far as that goes so that's kind of the functionalities of behind the scene and then i'm going to show you one more thing here which is our lessons page so the lessons page is only available for coding adventure um depending on um where we go with this but coding adventure right now is the only course that is available for lesson mode but i do find this to be important it's really good for either using it in its full functionality keeping kids with you or being able to do some differentiation so i'll kind of talk about all three of those so here the lessons are so they are set up in the same structure as our regular lessons our lessons are always an intro which is a unplugged activity the play time is a dive into the platform itself and a debrief could be a walk through it could be a reflectionary period anything like that what's nice about this is that i know that in lesson eight just by looking at this these are the challenges that the students will be working on um and here's some other challenges that might be usually in a walkthrough it's something that might be a newer concept that they haven't worked on i also have exclusively the lesson plan for that specific lesson right here and if you have this synced with google classroom and i apologize that i wasn't able to pull that up um for some reason it's i'm using my associates account uh and so she needed to approve me again for that so anyway but um so if i were in a google classroom itself i would begin i would actually instead of beginning the lesson it would say assign the lesson and the students would see this on their side of the it would say assigned lesson 8 and it would show the challenges which they need to work on and so you can go in and manually grade it there but for all the rest of them when you begin the lesson this is my favorite part about it is that the screens of every single student it says that we are now in the introduction stage every single student will see a lock on their screen so they're actually not able to do anything until you're ready to unlock them so this is just good for going over any unplugged activities any intros maybe doing that small group teachable lesson on lesson 15 challenge 15 that the students were struggling so it's kind of nice to kind of keep everyone together and not have the ability for them to mess around while you're talking and then what is also really really nice about this is let's say i have students that are they're not achieving at the same level as everybody else when i'm in the specific lesson and i'm going over the specific concept when i assign the challenges to these students so now the students screens will be unlocked and they will be in play time and what they will see is only when they go into coding adventure only the challenges that are associated with this lesson so that can keep everybody all in the same place once i end playtime the students will go back to their place where they were before so this is really really good for introducing new concepts especially variables or some of the other concepts that are covered in coding mentioned that might be a little bit more challenging and that students can't keep up with that's just a way that you can kind of keep everyone together and kind of do some differentiation once you like i mentioned end play time um then the student screens go back to locked and then you can do your challenge walkthroughs or anything like that the reference cards those are going to talk about all of the the code blocks that are at the bottom so you know the blocks of code don't they're not drag and drop but they do contain text so this will tell each and every single student what those blocks are and what they mean and then the character review card this is something that i always like to mention the character review card will tell the students when they're meeting a character but it's also very very important for when the students do the challenge builder because ad students work through coding adventure these characters and objects open up as they go through and it's just nice for them to have a reminder like this is how you move the turtle so we tell them that we have to have an object tag this is this is how we move the turtle this is what we do when we move the beaver so it's just kind of some good reminders for students as well banana tails game builder they have the reference card all built in for them so but for our younger students we like to have them have access to that so then once i end the lesson now you can see it is green and it means that i've already done that lesson any of the lessons that i have yet to do are going to be in white so it's just good to kind of keep kind of keeps you on track especially when you're teaching hundreds of sections of that um okay so we've talked about the gradebook in the proficiencies tab and we've talked about all parts of the behind the scenes i'm just going to briefly mention this and then we'll get into total q a here with all of you in just a minute is i'm going to click on the teacher resources so i clicked on the teacher resources on the left hand side of the screen here we do have a certification course if you didn't get tired of me today um this is of course uh covering the concepts within the first part of coding adventure they're short they'll just walk you through the concepts that are there especially if you're not super familiar it might be a nice way to just kind of do a refresher for you our webinars any webinars that we host you found our webinars today but our webinars are also hosted there from previously and you can also find them on our youtube channel as well all the lesson plans for all of our courses are located here howto guides let's say you forgot how to do something you can find the howto guides locate our help center you can find the help center here or down here in the lefthand side of the screen and there's a classroom complete classroom management guide i like to to note this we everything basically anything that you ever wanted to know is going to live inside of this document it's also on our help center but it has everything pedagogical resources grades by course proficiency in computer science topics how to limit how to view challenge solutions just really anything that you want to know is is in that document it's a very large document but it contains a lot of information we do have getting started video guides so this will walk you through basically everything that i'm doing right now we do have some short video tutorials adding a teacher assigning courses all of that good stuff hour of code notes those really aren't going to be so necessary for you and then classroom resources all the student certificates are located here and the solutions are also located here so the student solutions are so solutions are located on the teacher resource page and in the progress tab so just know you have that um availability um the creation my creations is where all of your creations live nobody else's but yours and then the discover like i mentioned our worldwide discovery platform and then in the help center i'm just going to go there briefly in the help center here you'll see a getting started guide for code for for code monkey it has everything as a text guide how to create classrooms how to add coteachers there's some different advanced steps there if you're not sure and then we also have these student login guides which is what i was showing my screen was not showing you what i was showing um so the student login guides are on the help center they're at the bottom section and here it will talk about how to sign up with how to share basically it's a guide for your students on how they can join code monkey using a student walkthrough we have that in this web version or we have it as a pdf that you can share with your students as well so if they're not sure how to join using a class code or any of that if you get stuck ever on that you can always reach out to us and we're happy to help with that um and so that's all that we have for that today so we did the lesson features the grade book and the proficiency the q a um our webinars page we talked about that um and then now i'm going to answer a couple of questions that we had previously and then um i'll show you um i'll get into your questions so what is the best way to get k3 students started so it's either having them importing a google classroom typically is going to be the easiest way for them to kind of sign in as well but you can just share a class code or anything in that manner would be the quickest way and then if you're not sure about where students should get started i'll just come back to the slide here we do have this located on the course page but this is basically where every single student should begin so kindergarten will begin with kobunky junior i typically like to have first and second grade start with copenhagen junior i love the lesson plans they have some really great unplugged activities that you can actually change to make virtually and i just like to get the students excited about coding as well um okay so the next question is how do i know which standards code monkey are aligned to so i showed you that in the course page there specifically um you can find the course and then you can click on the standards and it'll take you right there directly if you need something more customized then just reach out to whoever your regional sales director is and they'll help you with that as well susan good question nothing yet for canada but i'll definitely put that as a request down to our product team um regarding those standards i know that it's important for you guys as well what does it mean to upgrade so this is a really good question so oftentimes when you first sign up for your account you'll see that um this will say that is either expired or you have a teacher trial so see here i have this super teacher account so what i will do is i will upgrade it and then when i hit continue i just need to make sure that i'm selecting the correct subscription and with the correct subscription then i select it and then i just upgrade and that means that now my students in the classroom are going to be attached to the correct subscription so that's just an important thing to know or if it's expired so i just clicked on the upgrade and i just selected it we do have use just note here there is a usage report here and then this data to the export data to a csv it's very robust it will it contains a lot of student information it shows you everything that basically is in the progress page but in a csv file so if you ever need that as well and then i forgot to mention this but if i'm in a classroom i'm just going to click on a classroom and i'll go to the students tab here let's say this student class has ended and i want to move them i can click on over here i can click on this and i can select i can either archive all the students in the classroom archive only means that the students move to a nonactive position all of their student data will still live there or i can move them to a classroom we the only way that you can delete a student ever is if a student has never used code monkey and so that only means that they can um that means that they can't be that they never took up your subscription see if you do if you archive them it does not reopen a seat the only way the archive works is if you have a flexible type of subscription um and that's the only way that you'll be able to reopen those seats so the question about if a student left from school how can you get the space back unfortunately if you have the subscription that's a per student subscription they occupy that seat for the lifetime of the account susan had a question can students be moved to a different school so if that is the case so we have a lot of students that move around just let us know um and we can help with that as well because we want the students contain their same coding language and things like that um so susan i would say get probably with zach and um he can help you with that and zac and talia they should be able to help you with that part of it um but we do have students that move around pretty regularly in within districts which is always interesting okay so that's that question and then how do i get students to collaborate so i just created a jamboard and i created i took a challenge that i know students struggle with which is the first time this is an assessment challenge for coding adventure and you can create just put the challenges here and then have the students each code it using different colors or you know show theirs each working together collaboratively sometimes you can put them in a breakout room or something like that i had a trial period but never had the opportunity to use it can i get the trial again antoinette if you just want to send a message to support codemonkey.com we can help work through that as well um okay let's see here this is a good question edward asked this question is there the ability to limit progress for code monkey junior unfortunately at this time we do not have the ability for students to occupy basically for you to be able to limit students progress but it is something that we have heard from teachers that is unique how can i delete students from google classroom can i get the space back so if you have your classroom synced with google classroom what you'll need to do is you need to go to your google classroom or not go to your google classroom up here it will say it's been synced with google classroom and you just need to make sure you resync it um as far as the space brought i think it's going to be best that you reach out to your your rep whoever you've been working with and they can work through with you on those details because i'm not very familiar with your subscription itself antoinette i did see your question here about doing a small demonstration on how to teach code monkey there is a webinar that i did a little while ago and it is um getting started with coding adventure and i did like a mini type of lesson of teaching i would say that would be a really good resource for how to teach with code monkey i definitely would recommend that as well okay and i see a couple of questions here i already created student accounts with their emails is it too late to sync with the google classroom patty if they've already logged in i would um i would say just reach out to whoever your rep is or to support codemonkey.com and we can look into that sometimes if the student accounts are already google related like they have a they're already google authenticated there is a way that we can we can help you with that if you would like so just um i would say just reach out to support codemonkey.com and we can help take care of that for you um will the recording be available after this it's always they're always available they always live on our website so let me just go there so you guys can see it they live on the webinars page on the code monkey webinars page so when you go to codemonkey you'll see there's a webinars page here there's also some student webinars that i personally did with students over cook19 and we did some for hour of code but here are some specific ones that will walk you
