old Russian competition is such a cool way to begin to students encoding so I would totally encourage you to sign up for the coderush competition when it started because my students were so excited to color them I really like the different challenges that code monkey offered I felt that it was very basic at the beginning and the kids were able to build on the skills that they learned as they went from the competition and it was fun like to see what everybody's up to and to catch up the kids loved the different challenges they thought that they were amazing they could not wait until different levels opened up in the competition each meet and some kids as soon as they got home from school they would spend hours on all the parents were involved in this culture and they were all excited and you know our April was sensational you
