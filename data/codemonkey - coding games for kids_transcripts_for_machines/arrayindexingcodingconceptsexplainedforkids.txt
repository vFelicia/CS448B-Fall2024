hello welcome to array indexing let's learn about array indexing an array is a way to store many items together so if you have a lot of numbers you can store them in an array many strings can be put into an array or even many objects for example many bananas can be put into an array called bananas use indexing to refer to a single item in an array for example bananas square bracket zero which we could say bananas with the index of zero is the first banana in the bananas array now you might wonder well why is the first banana bananas with index zero well array indexing begins at zero in fact most counting in coding begins at zero so if you have three items those items would have had the index of 0 1 and 2. let's look at an example here's an example where we have several items as part of our challenge we have two bananas so those bananas could be put and they are into an array called bananas this one has the index of zero and this banana has is in the array bananas with an index of one we also have all of these bushes that are in an array called bushes with and each one has a different index since there's only one monkey it's not put into an array it's just monkey so let's see how we would solve this um turn two banana zero so the monkey's turning to bananas with index zero and then stepping the distance to that same banana and then turn to bananas with index 1 and we probably want to let's see step the distance to banana one okay let's try that great let's look at one more example here's a challenge with beavers we have three of them and they are in an array called beavers so we have beavers with index 0 with index 1 and beavers with index 2. we also have all of these islands that are in our ray um and when we have our single monkey and our banana so let's see what this challenge is all about uh looks like we are um having this first beavers with index zero step four this beaver steps eight what do we think beavers with index two will step four eight probably twelve oh we need to move it so a good way to a little tip for moving code around is you can do your cut and paste using your keyboard shortcuts and then we want to step 12 okay and then we will step the distance to banana okay let's see how that works great now that we've learned a little bit about array indexing it's your turn good luck you
