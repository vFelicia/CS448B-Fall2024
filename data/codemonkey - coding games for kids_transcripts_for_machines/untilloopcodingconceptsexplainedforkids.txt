welcome to the sands of until let's learn about until until is a type of loop the loop will run until a condition is met this is how you write the until loop and use the keyword until space the condition that you want to meet and then you could have any number of commands below but each would need to be indented here's an example until near bridge near bridge is the condition step one so basically i want to step one until i'm near the bridge as soon as i'm near the bridge i'll stop looping and i'll go to the the next command outside of the loop let's look at an example here's an example where we have two until loops if we look at the actual challenge we want the mouse to grab the match and then go to the pile and drop it so we have the first until loop is basically going to have the mouse stepping until it's near the match and then we want the mouse to grab the match and then loop and step until it's near the pile and then we can drop the match on the pile let's see how that works oh okay so we're in a situation right now where we have an endless loop we know since the mouse never turned to the pile it's never going to get near the pile it's just going to keep stepping and never getting near the pile so this loop here will run forever so you got to make sure that when you have an until loop that the condition will be met so let's see before we step let's turn to the pile and then step make sure we're always turning to the pile before we're stepping okay very good now in that example we could have put the turn two above the until near pile because the pile never moves so this didn't have to be in the loop it could have been right above the until and it would still work let's look at another example here's an example that's similar to the last one but a little different in that we're calling the until loop within a function called chase but also there's an ant that is going to be moving that match so the match is now a moving target uh so if we just go in within the function until near m now what m is our parameter that takes on match the first time chase is called and the second time chase is called m is pile so when we have this loop we want to make sure since the match will be moving we want to always turn to it and then uh i guess step right we want to step one so we're getting closer to it each time we're turning stepping turning stepping until we're near it and then we'll grab it and in the case of the pile we'll drop it let's see how this works there we go got it oops so something uh tickle oh is it gonna get to the pile oh i know what i messed up on instead of saying match i need to just say m so first time it will be the match it's turning to the second time it will be the pile okay that's it it's your turn to use until good luck
