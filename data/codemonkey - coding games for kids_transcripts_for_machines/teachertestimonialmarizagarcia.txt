a lot of our students when they start in Middle School don't know what coding is or often think it's very difficult or something that they won't be able to learn but I think Code Monkey does a very great job at breaking it down and making coding seem easy and not so scary our teachers really love the resources and features in Code Monkey I know they really appreciate the student progress chart they can see at a glance how many levels students have completed and know if they're needing Assistance or reteaching students are excited to log on and get farther into the program they like the instant feedback and the stepbystep instruction and a lot of them have made it kind of like a competition in their classroom so they'll see who can get Farther Along schools that are not using Code Monkey are missing out Code Monkey is a program that is loved by both teachers and students and I feel like it's hard to come across a program that is loved by both they have HandsOn learning they learn problem solving skills creativity and real world application
