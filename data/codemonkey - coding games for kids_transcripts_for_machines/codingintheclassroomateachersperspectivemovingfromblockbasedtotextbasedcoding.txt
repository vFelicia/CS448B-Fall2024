okay everyone we are gonna go ahead and get started with today's webinar which we are so excited about so today's webinar is hosted by our code monkey team of ambassadors page you want to go ahead and skip to the next slide there um so before we get started just be sure to follow us on all of our social media platforms twitter instagram facebook you can also check out our code monkey blog which the ambassadors will share about here at the end as well as on linkedin you can also tweet at us during today's webinar as well next okay so today's webinar is moving from black from sorry from block based coding to textbased coding led by our team of teacher ambassadors and so i'll let them introduce themselves in just a minute but we just want to thank you so much for joining us for today's webinar our code monkey ambassador team and the code monkey team as well wants to thank you so much for pitching we go back to this one um for joining today's webinar we know that obviously this last few years has been anything but normal but our goal today is to share teaching tips and strategies from the ambassadors themselves from going through the pandemic and just some different strategies and takeaways and tips that they learned throughout this time so if you have any questions please feel free to pop those in the chat box in the q a section and also you can tweet at us during today's webinar as well if we don't get to your question during today's webinar we'll make sure to send you a followup email as well and at the end of today's webinar you'll get a survey link and the survey link once you fill that out it will give you credit for today's webinar who doesn't love some pd credit right okay next so we're going to get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world today so i just want to introduce myself my name is lena saleh i have been with code monkey for three years prior to that i had taught in the classroom for just a little over 10 years i am the professional development manager and the professional development and sales manager here at codemonkey you can always reach out to me on my twitter and i also do have my own personal youtube channel so feel free to check that out as well so we're just lucky to have you so thank you guys so much for joining us and i'm going to let our two ambassadors take it away hello everybody my name is javier hilar i'm the prek fifth grade teacher uh for peace for woman sir academy in fort worth texas i love to use um coding resources and one of my favorites is called monkey and ambassador since 2014 and also i do after school clubs using code monkey and other resources for robotics and korean and so i love to share with you today my my journey from how to use it some of these resources the code monkey offer for educators for elementary students starting from first grader to maybe to fifth graders okay thank you hello welcome everybody i'm paige bestoff i'm from new jersey i teach elementary school digital technology and gifted and talented grades two through five and my mission is to provide all students with access to computer science and steam so we're going to begin our webinar with our objectives okay so today's webinar objectives will go ahead and cover this um but as you guys know over the pandemic it was thought that well not during the pandemic but just over the last few years coding was once only thought to be used for those older students but the pandemic just using the textbased you know coding languages but the pandemic i think brought a new perspective to all of you as teachers and just as you start to take more risks and things with coding itself so we're excited for our teacher investors to share those so today we're going to go over using blockbased coding languages with young learners will cover the blockbased courses of code monkey junior and our beaver achiever courses then we'll discuss using textbased coding for those upper grade levels of students and through the coding adventure space adventure and banana tales courses and just before we actually get into going over this slide itself we are going to just go ahead and take a quick little poll here we'd love to just see um what grade levels you're working with and then just kind of how familiar you are with coding itself and then we'll go ahead and go through this so we'll give you just just a couple of just about a minute or so to go ahead and take this poll here and then we will get going with the rest of the webinar all right so it looks like the majority of you had a chance to vote so i'm actually going to share the results with you so hopefully you can see the results you can see that majority of you do teach the upper elementary and middle school levels there and that some of you are sort of you know in the middle with coding and i think that's kind of where we all are and where and where we hope to kind of share those experiences with you today so we're going to go ahead and take a look here at um our courses that we do offer here at code monkey so we kind of have a spectrum we suggest grade levels k through eight obviously these courses can really be adjusted for where your students are their needs and their previous coding knowledge so you can see here um we move from block based to coffeescript and coffeescript is a shorter programming language basically it's not very syntax heavy doesn't have a lot of curly brackets and things like that we know that young learners even more advanced learners don't know how to put periods right don't know how to spell in it you know capitalize their names those types of things so giving them extra syntax like curly brackets and things just tend to confuse them so this gives them the opportunity to learn those textbased languages but without having to be tied down and then we move right along to our python so we'll kind of review a few of these courses with you today through the ambassador's point of view so yeah feel free to ask questions in the chat box all right so i'm going to start by going over what is block coding so hopefully some of you have experienced some of the block coding applications so blocks introduce students to coding concepts without the need to know how to type so students also do not know need to know how to read which is a huge help they can just follow along with what's the what's going on on the screen and they can drag blocks into the correct location the blocks at the youngest level are arrows and symbols and here's a picture here that show direction so as students move to the higher courses the blocks then will have words and symbols so students at even the earliest age are introduced to the fundamental concepts of programming operators loops and events so they think that they're playing games and they don't really actually realize that they're learning okay so two of the blockbased programs in uh code monkey are code monkey junior and beaver achiever and we're going to begin by taking a look at code monkey junior so code monkey jr has friendly characters as you can see by the graphic fun graphics and students love the sounds and interacting with the characters okay so for nonreaders or our youngest students in prek to first grade although my second grade students love code monkey junior so these are the concepts that are covered okay so i'm going to give a quick demonstration of what code monkey jr looks like so i'm going to go into the code monkey account and right here is our code monkey jr and again it's marked as prereader so the students do not have to know how to read and then they can see here that the monkey wants to get to the treasure chest and then they can just take their box and drag them up and press there is sound but i don't have the sound turned on at the moment so and of course we can hear your sound oh oh so i can't hear my sound okay so so he's hopefully he's not too loud so he's celebrating so no it's the perfect the perfect volume okay so then uh here's a sample of some students playing you can do it on the tablet i don't have tablets in my school so we use them on chromebooks you can use it on radio computers while we were home during uh virtual learning my students were able to use it on almost any device and of course you can project it up on your smart board if you have one okay the next one that i'd like to talk about is beaver achiever so beaver achiever is perfect for the first and third grade okay although depending on students reading level i definitely have older students that have used beaver achiever so i've used it with my fourth grade and some of my fifth graders there are some words here but there's also the arrows and symbols so even though that the students are introduced to words on the blocks they don't need to be able to read them so i've had anywhere from second graders use beaver achiever all the way through to my fifth graders okay some students need to start with block coding in order to become motivated and persevere so if they find that they're successful early on it encourages them to continue and progress with the harder levels so again even though my students are older than that first through third grade it gives them that motivation and that level of success so if they know that they're successful then they'll be able to go on to the textbased coding okay yeah yes uh like mention it uh paige mention it there's a baby red shiver and cold monkey is a good starter for little grades i use senate personally with the students the first time when i used to call monkey junior as similar to scratch junior but always more helpful more engagement and i see the uh how the students enjoy it so i really like it and i mentioned it the first time i see it is only available in ipads so in ios systems but unfortunate fortunately the code monkey always received feedback from teachers and from anybody they want to improve something so they improve it and they open it for any system so any chromebooks any uh windows systems desktops laptops telephones and everything so that is very helpful so the next one like i said beaver achiever is very helpful as well too because it's different it's working with sounds music and everything so students love it so i wouldn't say my students come how they challenge how they solve it and i really enjoy to do some kind of leadership skills in my class so when the students mastering i really i ask them to give you know the solution but i'll give you some clues to the students struggle to give you like kind of teamwork so that's i really want to improve that one so you notice here in my class i have my upper graders this is third graders in my school to assist me to go visit first and second graders when we have enrichment on fridays to go one to one a student integrated to first grader to teach them how to use the system so i believe so it's a great tool a great teamwork that you can maybe challenge your students tenth graders to teach the little ones to tease the kindest to teach the first graders so i promoting leadership in my school and this is another example how my students engage in on friday's enrichment i do robotics and also to coding classes using code monkey and you notice here they have three stars also for to see it you have complete successfully the challenge and this is an example how the uh vivid achiever works you drag in your locks and click the green arrow icon you see this is something that introduced my students to segmentation so don't try to solve the problem at the same time to live by the steps so you little by little students start saying oh my goodness that's true so you give you the option to to start the problem solving and fix and little pieces students gonna be understand the best concept and also the same time you introduce to them how to use the loops remember you can have a big lines of code and you can reduce it when you use the loop good job that's good so another thing that really empowered my students said the computers are not the smarter you are the smarter because the computers they can do anything without giving you some directions so that is something that my students all the time asked i can do it or the struggle of the uh sometimes frustrated but i said no take your time let's do it together and try to do the solution remember you encourage your students failures are okay there's nothing wrong with the failures because we're learning the failures right so now we're going to move on to um text base coding so text based coding is uh when students begin typing in directions instead of dragging in blocks so encoding adventure which is the sample shown here students can also click on these buttons that are down on the bottom and then they're still prompted to enter additional information so for example if they click the step button they'll still have to type in how many times they need to step okay since textbased coding follows syntax rules uh as lena had mentioned earlier the the curly cues and periods and some arrows and dashes and things like that okay so they are still um being uh familiarized with real world programming so students are able to challenge themselves by having to type the code and not just know which blocks to drag okay so again here is an example of coding adventure so once my students in second grade completed they uh this year they did code monkey junior they completed beaver achiever and then some of them actually got to move on to coding adventure so again second grade and these are students that i did not see the first half of the year i didn't even get to meet most of my second grade students until almost march or april and they actually were able to go in and learn how to do this so just because it's for um third grade and up doesn't mean that you second grade students can't get challenged and here my students work collaboratively so they can help each other when the code becomes difficult to master so on this uh pic slide here is uh prepandemic but i do have some other slides with pictures showing how they work during uh last year but they do work together collaboratively so that they can help each other and again not get frustrated yeah there's something like page mention it the code adventure is um targeting grades three to eight but you can adapt it for any grade level the challenge is 420 challenges that are divided in three courses 210 challenges are restoring more or consider introducing challenge to another students programming language using coffeescript the current concepts cover is called an inventory is using loops objects variables arrays for loops the coding adventure 2 they use more advanced information for coding like functions conditions boolean logic if else for example and or and the last part of this current adventure is the using operators like no comparations function return values triggering events using the mouse so it's a great complete course so i highly recommend it for greatest the other one they want to talk right now is doral mats doromats using okay this one is okay this is gonna i was yeah i was going to show real quick coding adventure yes so just so you can see what it looks like so this is coding adventure part two and you can see that it they're still typing in it's a little bit more complex but they still are able to click on the buttons to help them move along all right go ahead javier sorry the other program they're using in my class is do do do dots math because this is some crossing curriculum the uh coding or in this case uh code monkey using it to reinforce it what is students doing with math and you also can ask the students do you using math is important in coding because they're using subtractions using divisions multiplications and also use geometry like angles and everything so for example i remember as my students so remember how you symbolize your multiplication when you're writing so you put a little x in computer so you need to define what is multiplication with the aster so is need to do learn these concepts because they cannot be saved you know what is uh multiplication is different when you're representing a computer when you made it in writing so body is a great result great great resource for reinforced math this is a targeting for second to fifth graders they contain 20 levels and dot dots math offers students fun game challenge that will help them practicing from second to great mathematics concepts banana tales is another great resource a great course from con monkey because allows students to create their own games to be creative because remember the students they need to understand they only know how to uh play they need to create they use the imagination they use the creativity to learn and they use is more like like i said for advanced classes and they have 75 challenges in part one and you see it they have you working with the statements loops variables arrays in the scene and for loops the part two they use class variables scope input and also dictionaries and 2d list bubble stars how i can incorporate python and k5 to k25 i have a gta students that all the time help me with my classes when the students struggle when i teach in coding these students using right now the program in python python is another program similar to javascript but they really want to see it you need to challenge your students when they want to expectation is higher and say you know what it's really i want to learn something else so don't stop the creativity for the students i really encourage them to go to move forward to learn more advance i believe so the python is teaching more like in the middle in high schools but it never starts early i believe so you create a great foundation in elementary it's gonna be give you better skills for the middle and high school right so this is a picture of my class um during the the previous year so here i have uh students this particular class here you could see that this was on this year that they're socially distanced they're wearing masks but these young ladies who are here they're actually standing up and working out the way that they should be moving so my students they look at the challenges and then they act them out so this way they can physically figure out what to do and again even though they weren't near each other they were still able to collaborate so someone had asked earlier on in the chat about pair programming so this is not true pair programming which is one device and two students however um they are working on the same challenges at the same time they discussed what are they going to go into which one are they going to work on because i let them choose and then they actually work together and they turn their screens and show each other what they're working on so um even though we were in in person we were able to do that now in the front picture over here this is another program that um we have on on code monkey it's called space adventure it's part of the hour of code and my second graders um not all of them but some of them were able to work on this challenge as well and it also um the second through fifth graders worked on it so here you could see in this picture that i have students who are at home so they were learning remotely they're sharing their screen here asking for help they're working together remotely at home and then the students in the classroom here in the back they're also able to go and help each other and so they walked around the room just like javier said that they were able to um assist their classmates and then even um remotely what i had my students do is if everybody at home wasn't able to help each other that one student who is in class would come and stand in front of the camera the webcam and they would go through it and help the students who were at home so this again they shared their screens and then they were able to assist them so it's very very collaborative really lets the students be able to work together okay one of the other things that i did was i created this poster um it's called tips to help with frustration i have this hanging in my classroom i also have it on my pinned on my google classroom page because students really know that they shouldn't give up when things get hard and these are some of the tips that i tell my students to muse so we uh and uh computer science do something called rubber ducky programming so here's my little rubber duck friend so my my students don't all have rubber ducks at home so one of the things i tell them to do is if they're at home and they can't talk to a partner they can't actually speak to somebody in class if they're working from home is to um talk to a stuffed animal and try to work it out with um just by thinking through the process so uh code monkey also gives hints so what they can do is um keep track of what they try write it down describes what's happening and think about what should happen and then go through and try to make some changes okay uh lena i think this is you um sorry um so you can see here and gloria agree with you paige always has great tips um so um so some of the concepts that are covered within each of these courses really kind of range so i know each of them mentioned you know different things the code monkey junior is really computational thinking their lesson those lesson plans in that course are really my favorite um so we have the beaver achiever and you can kind of see the sequences here i'm not sure why this is my error here there's really only three courses in beaver achiever there's 115 challenges that we just recently expanded and it's going to be enough content for more than a year for your students there um coding adventure goes pretty advanced it starts out pretty i'm just really teaching those fundamentals and then it gets into more advanced concepts like page had shown where they're defining functions um they're doing some boolean logic and then they really get into like onboarding and not operating um event driven things that are being triggered so when i push this key what happens so really just moving into those more advanced concepts so beyond challenge 75 that moves pretty quickly and gets pretty advanced there dota does math if you do teach at the elementary levels which it looked like majority of you did um the favorite one that i like to use is the dota just map angles you pick up a protractor and you actually measure the distances when i was in the classroom and i had students that were struggling i actually utilized this course with them it was the first time that they really understood within it what an acute and obtuse angle was and kind of just really understanding that measurement in a more visual way so it was nice to see those kind of light bulbs go on as well um and then banana tails javier mentioned that he uses this with his younger students anyone who's a little bit more seasoned i guess you would say in the coding programming language could do banana tales we've had younger students do it as well but just if they're not so familiar with it it can get a little bit frustrating when you don't know those sequences you know how do you do the syntax incorrectly so we always want students to feel we want them to feel ownership and feel excited about that and so that's kind of what we try to encourage throughout all of coding throughout all of the courses itself like paige mentioned space adventure um is our newer course but um probably one of our favs i just wanted to to mention i do a lot of crosscurricular work with my because i'm a technology teacher but i bring this into the into the regular classrooms so um when lena was talking about the angles when my students were learning quadrilaterals in the third and fourth grade classes uh they they use this uh dota this map as the reinforcer and a lot of our coding adventure as well so when they were first learning how to use protractors in their math class they then reinforced it by using the protractor and coding and venture and also in dodo does that so which is really really helpful and again all my note think that we mentioned it earlier reinforces those typing skills so even though that you know uh in the textbased coding they're practicing well where are the letters on the keyboard where are the numbers how do i find it where are those brackets and things like that yes and um nevermind lost my train of thought i think something what i loved uh um paige really led and created this webinar for you all today um what i loved most about paige's story is i think what a lot of us kind of come into uh when we start teaching coding is when you are your students kind of come in with no computerbased knowledge we sometimes feel that maybe they can't achieve we get nervous about them achieving at those higher levels and kind of taking those risks so i think what was really great is you know pages students the first time they ever see computers or any type of things when they come to her classroom in their um are they first grade page or second second grade we don't have any devices kbk one uh prek one at all so their first device they're seeing is second grade and so she started using fewer cheaper right um with the second grade we started co code monkey junior and let them start on junior because they didn't even know how to type their names and i think um and so and it just i think what page has learned from this year and what i love about her story is just that she was able to see you know what the students were able to achieve without really you know this year's it's not like you were sitting right next to most of your students they were really kind of achieving it and have to doing it virtually and kind of taking those risks and i think that's always the hardest part is taking the risk when you begin coding so i think it i think that's what's so special about both of our ambassadors and really all of you is that once you start really getting into coding itself you just see what the students can achieve and i really do think it ties to also just like regular achievement in their classes they're able to see how to sequence and really kind of tie that into other components okay if we we have a little bit of time so i think i'm going to show them the teacher dashboard okay okay all right and then we'll take some of these we have a couple of live questions so why page is getting that up and going um we had a question from one of our participants are there any programming paired programming lessons in the curriculum so there are a couple in a couple of the lessons some suggestions for students to work collaboratively but i think as programmers i don't think that there's any thing wrong with students sitting side by side and programming together i think the important piece is that they each do their own so that they can be accountable for their work because if javier does my work for me i'm never going to know how to do it independently and so we just always kind of we kind of encourage that collaboration and i think javier does that a lot in his classroom with his students as well so over here is the uh the full teacher before i was showing you the student version so here if you go to teacher resources you'll see that there's a bunch of different tabs my favorite one especially when i was brand new at this and i had no idea what i was doing uh especially with the coffeescript and the python was the solutions so as the teacher i'm just gonna go to one at random one of the higher up ones it will show you what the threestar solution is supposed to be so as a teacher you don't have to ever feel that you don't know what you're doing and not to do it so don't you as a teacher are a facilitator or lead learner you're learning alongside with your students so this is here to support you uh again um there's also um lesson plans so you can download i'm not going to click on them to download but you'll see that you can download lesson plans for all of the different activities there's howto guides okay setting up classrooms adding students if you do any of the hour of code challenges so again my favorite uh one of them was where is it um yeah so the banana tails if you want to try out the python banana tails just for yourself you can try it out as an hour of code activity just so that because again i don't know any python until i tried this out so here it gives you more information about it how to set up a whole hour of code so this might be something interesting to do during computer science education week this week you show them something completely different okay and this you can definitely do all my third graders were evil even able to do that so those are some notes certificates for your students and some posters and things like that something that i really want to and reinforce you guys the dashboard help you to see uh the students struggles the students achievements what the students for example say you know what i see everybody struggling and number eight challenge let's go discuss so you can present it and so um from that have a conversation with the students and i see what is the struggle to reinforce them to everybody understand so you notice there they have little stars and you see the little blue screen that means they have a challenge so they have problems with that they give you a little graphic uh perspective what is your students doing it and of course you can see it what is students already almost finished everything so you can ask this student in particular you already mastered that so you can be my assist my teacher assistant in the class but remember as your teacher assistant or your student they help you don't give you the solution only give you some clues because like lena and paige agree we are here to reinforce every student learning at the same time so it is no good to give you the solution right away also up here if you notice you can turn on or off the hints and you can limit their progress so maybe you only want them to learn how to do the stepping and turning or um only work on challenges one through ten during that class time so you can and then for grading purposes for those of you who need to give grades you can click on the export data and then have their grades there's a gradebook here as well tells you what they completed gives you a list of your students their signins and again you can assign lessons and then see the lesson plans so maybe i'll try to see if i can open that up just so you can get an idea so here's the the lesson plans are all here in slide format and your objectives your vocab your standards and gives you stepbystep instructions how to teach the course and the introductory part of those lessons it does have usually an unplugged type of an activity so that's usually introducing to the concept and then there's some play time which is the bulk of the lesson plan itself and then the last part is debrief so usually reflecting on something that you've learned um throughout the course and i know paige had mentioned that she used coach monkey jr with her second grade students i always love to use this with really any of the students because it because there's not really any barrier to entry there's not a lot of text tying them down it's really fun and it just kind of gets them going and the lesson plans in code monkey junior the unplugged activities those ones are my favorite especially for like the younger kids has a lot of movement and i know that we don't really know what this year is going to look like um as the pandemic rages on um so it's always just you know you can always take those also like virtually as well um so here on this slide here we have um our code monkey blog which i had mentioned um at the beginning but we do have both page and javier have both written their own blog posts here on why coding is important and best websites to learn coding both of i don't know what happened here with the formatting there but both javier and paige also lead our monthly twitter chats and so we hope that you can also join us for those as well and then we do have a clean monkey super fans group it's really our code monkey pln group and we do you know we really want to encourage you to collaborate as much as possible because that's the most important piece of teaching anything is just the collaboration that you can have not only that you encourage with your students but amongst yourselves as teachers um i'll answer this one question here one person asked does could monkey still have the computer science competition um right now we don't have the competition um in place but we do have some things in the works that we're hoping to be able to share with you all soon barbara had a question and maybe you and javier can answer this for students with no coding experience fourth and fifth graders would you recommend beginning with code monkey junior absolutely correct go ahead javier you can answer yeah absolutely i believe so this is a great starter because they're gonna be start moving uh the easy challenge and they're gonna be moving to a little more harder chargers so um maybe you say no cod monkey junior is easy so move it to a bigger and cheaper viva achiever is is a good example because cannot be started with the easy lines of code but they're going to be introducing them to using the loops i believe so they made any segmentation and reinforce them to how to do it but you don't lose anything if they like it maybe they finish all code monkey junior and then jump into um vivid achiever yeah i absolutely think that it gives them the motivation because they started with something that's easy to them they say oh this is so much easy this is fun if you start some of them on something that's a little bit complicated sometimes they get turned off and they don't they don't want to try extra hard and especially this year they're going to find so many things challenging that give them something that's going to be easier for them to feel really good about themselves and then the next question was can the lessons be assigned through google classroom so all of the coding adventure lesson plans are adapted in our lesson mode and so those can be as long as you're basically if your accounts are synced as a google google account then you can go ahead and you can connect that right to your google classroom so we do have that ability there so great question so we would love to go ahead and open this up to next page two questions for you i know some of you have been popping in questions as we've been progressing here but it's always nice to hear directly from you any questions or wonderings that you have we have these two great resources here really the time we want to honor your time and your questions just as much as the information that we've been able to share with you today the questions could be anything about computer science uh remote learning hybrid uh inperson learning i spend a lot of time my big focus in my classes is collaboration it's really important for me that my students are able to work with others so what are some ways page that you have been able to foster collaboration with your students because pages in new jersey so it's been a little bit different rules obviously in every state and every every county and every place um so i'd love to hear your perspective on how collaboration worked for you um and your students yes so um as i mentioned a little bit earlier uh that my students even though that they had to socially distance and as far as i know they will still have to um be three feet apart in september i still want to make sure that they're working with others so if uh they're in the classroom and they're not able to actually work together i let them work with a partner that sits nearby i don't i can't control where they sit so i can't choose their partners so hopefully um very what i try to do is have one student who's really strong at reading with a student who's not as strong at reading when we're working on the uh the text based so that and it's not always my best students who are the best at computer science and coding usually my best students are the ones who get frustrated first because they're used to being good at everything all the time and they really have to think about this this is not something that just comes easily the block based coding might be more intuitive but the textbased coding they really need to pay attention so those students especially in the upper grades i know i constantly tell my fourth and fifth graders we start um if you're respect referring to yourself with the letter i must be capital letter i so they need to know that they have it's very very specific that they have to type things correctly and they can't just wing it so i really try to pair my students um based on their learning styles that being said if they're not whoever they're sitting next to hopefully their classroom teacher has already uh fostered that kind of collaboration within the math and this and this uh in english uh ela classes so um they're they're able to uh already have a partner but if we were under um normal circumstances hopefully uh at some point this year then i just have my students they work by uh whoever they'd like to work with and they really do uh collaborate together no matter who no matter who they're working with they work together this year my second graders would uh just flock to each other whoever was on a different whatever lesson they were on and again my second graders went all the way up through coding adventure one which was amazing since they had never seen any technology before javier you have um students in your classroom that speak also different languages are there do you find that there's any um anything that prohibits them from learning how to code with um being different you also have a different language as well so i would love to kind of hear your perspective there too yeah i believe so coding is universal so you need to learn in spanish or reading in spanish or reading in english so have the concept have the base i believe so understand there so my students they're learning visual learners like me so when you show them the first exercise together they catch it right away so it's um the but the language is not rare for them because they already see it it's like in math two plus two is four so it's the same concept when you're using in in uh encoding i see the students and say oh i got the solution and sometimes they find a different ways when they don't use the loops but at the same time they reinforce then and understand better when the keyboard is important because like page mentioned sometimes the they see the uh parenthesis is almost the same like the bracket or the curly bracket or the square bracket but when i mention it to using incorrectly when they use the shift key how important is to understand how the shift key works so they see visualize and say oh my goodness that's that's the problem so good about your introduction then the concepts and say this is the buggy you're looking right now a bug oh what is mark also sometimes they they joking with me it's a flight there or something then i say no it's something like you finding something wrong in your program something running your and you're coding let's find out that is the concept for debugging oh i got it so and explaining the history of the debugging one is this miss hopper when they're learning that they're learning about this a little little buggy so this counts as the students already learning in an early stages because they are my goal is to prepare them when go to the middle school and maybe despite the interest in early ages to continue learning computer science in the future great feedback okay so it doesn't look like there are any more questions but just know that you can always reach out to any of our ambassadors you can also reach out to anyone of our team want to go to the next live page so um obviously we from both all of us we thank you guys so much for joining us for today's webinar next slide and like we said if you have any questions you can always reach out
