everyone we want to thank you so much for joining us for today's webinar the code monkey team wants to thank you all for joining us for our webinar and bringing your questions for us we have some really great questions beforehand we want to thank those of us that are joining us on facebook and youtube for today's event our goal of today's webinar is to really get you excited about coding and to give you a first look into what it looks like to own a coding company and we know that this year has been anything but normal and we hope that if anything this this coronavirus pandemic endemic has shown you that our world is going even more digital if you would like to ask any questions during today's event please write it in the chat box or if you're joining us on zoom you can also place it in the q a box so you can also follow us on our twitter instagram facebook our youtube or you can also check out our code monkey blog it's always up to date with some new fun trends and unplugged activities and different topics that we cover so we hope that you give us a chance to check that out as well and now i'm going to go ahead and we're going to meet the team that's going to be hosting alongside myself um so my name first i'm the mc for today's event my name is lena saleh and i'm the professional development and sales manager and basically what that means is that i work with teachers to train them on how to become code monkey teachers and then i also help your teachers purchase to bring code monkey to you and now i'm going to let the rest of my panelists introduce themselves hi everyone my name is molly schubach i am a member of the sales team here at codemonkey and joining today to help answer questions through zoom so thanks everyone for joining us hi everybody i'm bret eskelsen i also work on the sales team here and help schools and teachers get started using codemonkey and we're really excited to have everyone here i concur with that all right and now most importantly who you've been waiting to meet today and you are going to now meet our founder ido shore hi everyone uh so my name is da shor i'm a cofounder of code monkey studios and the cto which is chief technology officer uh excited uh to be here awesome thank you so much udo and i know everyone is very excited to be able to hear your story so today's webinar is going to be learning about what is code monkey from the founder himself um his story and we're gonna do an uh interview styles uh q a session here and then we also took your questions and we're going to ask him your questions as well as what questions you've asked in the q a um some people are asking when does this end this will be about 40 minutes or so so just so you have that on your agenda so code monkey um began in 2014 with the doe his brother and one of their childhood best friends they are computer programmers by nature and they'll be able to share he'll be able to share his story with you today um and basically when they started to begin teaching coding to kids they realized that they much prefer to learn it in a more gamified way and so that's how code monkey was born and so today we have about 20 million users worldwide so we hope that if you haven't checking us out during this hour of code event that you at least give us a try i think you'll really enjoy collecting bananas as much as we do so now it is time for our interview so i hope you all are as excited as we are um so first question for you ido is how did you first get interested in programming and coding and developing yeah so uh it was probably like 20 years ago when i was about 10 12 about that age there was a program called uh flash uh you might still see it sometimes like your browser will tell you flash is disabled so it's an old technology that's uh no longer watching use but it was uh it was a cool technology for like making like small animations and games and uh i just wanted i was like playing games myself and i wanted to create uh some of my own so i just i had a book of how to like how to work with flash so yeah this is like an example of something i made probably when i was like 11 years old like a small animation screenshot of the animation actually does a few things and there's like a little bit of uh uh interactions so uh like i was making small games and just uh writing just writing a little bit of code and learning how to code just a little bit while doing it so yeah it was the very first experience i had coding great um and as you can see here it didn't start out as um as amazing as code monkey is today so we i think that's great to see an example of how you begin began your coding journey oops excuse me okay so our next question is what was your first job right after you finished college and you'll hear ido say university because ito lives in israel if you did not know um and so there they call it university and here we call it college that's right i'm uh from israel and uh english is my second language so forgive me if i uh take a little more time um yes after university i worked at as a programmer in this company that did basically algorithms for medical things like i was doing this program which took a bunch of images of eyes of patients and just trying to make the eye doctors work a little easier by matching eye images together and it was actually as more boring than it sounds uh wasn't very exciting actually i guess i should be thankful it wasn't very exciting because it did drive me to work on something that i do like which is code monkey and uh and start that so i i did enjoy uh the process in that first job that you enjoy uh having something working and helping you know something important but the daytoday was a kind of a letdown so yeah totally understand that i think everybody can relate and those of you when you reach out of college you'll also understand sometimes you don't always love your job as much as you would like so heart we hope we spark some joy for you today um so can you tell us so we know that you didn't really love your first job but you enjoyed the experience that you gained from that first job but what made you decide that you wanted to get started with code monkey uh so the ideas in code monkey and like many of the ideas started from me and my brother jonathan talking he had experience teaching kids to code and he had experience using just seeing what works and what doesn't work um like we both grew up playing computer games but i was like always more involved in that uh i always liked just being creative with music and with uh art um so from these conversations and just um seeing how he used to teach coding uh we got the idea of just uh taking something that actually uh worked well which was the logo programming language another technology that is kind of old um taking that idea and taking it further uh making it a game like uh putting a monkey in there like a cute monkey and having a story around it just um yeah like like you said we thought about how we would like to learn coding and we just it made a lot of sense to do it that way very great um okay so can you tell us a little bit about um and we all love the fun monkey i do know that ego has a fun fact for us and i know that he did some of the music for code monkey uh yeah i'm not sure how much of that music is still uh in the game i think maybe the only thing that's left that we haven't replaced because when you work on a product you keep like iterating like we have this you know things like you make like a a very harsh sound when you fail a challenge then people will tell you that's a little bit too harsh then we replace it with like a smaller ding or something so we keep iterating even on the sound but i think you know the one thing that i did like compose and state is like just a little uh that's when you finish uh when you collect all the bananas so that stayed and uh yeah we grew a little from there and we could hire uh professional musicians to do the to do the music to take over that although italy is quite talented in music so not only does he program he also plays some music which is more than we can say for some of the rest of us um so can you tell everyone i know you kind of touched over this briefly in the beginning but can you tell everyone what your role is within code monkey uh yes so the title is a chief technology officer and it can mean a few different things in a few different companies in our company uh it means uh i managed uh development team so we have a development team is uh three developers who you know code a product and code like everything around like either the games themselves or everything around the games making sure users can log in and the website is up and that everything is working and working on new features so i manage the developers and manage uh our product manager and i over select so basically it means overseeing the product and so that means the product is code monkey so that's what you guys all see on your side so he makes all of the everything that you see and do on code monkey is has to do with etho and his team so um sorry yeah i might explain to the product is uh so there's a lot of faces to it if you're a student then maybe you log in and you see uh you can play a game but there are lots of other parts of it that you might don't see that maybe only your teacher can see a bunch of screens and maybe like uh there are all kind of things that are working behind the scene to make sure like everything is uh working smoothly so yeah lots of aspects to that yeah basically the brain of code monkey part of vito and his team um so what are some things that you do um day to day so when you go into the office or you start working at co you start your day what are some things that you do in your day today um so big part of my job is working with my developers so if uh the people listening the students listening now have tried a bit of coding on codemonkey so they know what it means basically you can think of all coding as solving small riddles in code monkey it's uh like the reader is just getting the monkey to the banana but the job of uh of a code monkey developer might consist of things like um fixing a bug or having a certain data moving back and forth and there's a lot to it sometimes it's uh usually developers can are independent and they can figure out themselves but in many cases there are many different ways to do one thing so it's also something that happens in code monkey sometimes you can use a loop sometimes you can't use something just you don't have to use a loop but you can solve the same thing in a few ways so there's there's a lot of discussions i have when i with my developers it's less of using a loop yes or no it's more like uh gets into like uh uh like heavier questions revolving uh design design has in how the code is structured it's like the code monkey have when you write a when you solve a code market challenge you get 10 lines of code um the code monkey app meaning everything that's running behind the scenes and making sure that everything is working consists of uh tens of thousands of lines of code so it's like uh there are lots of considerations a lot of things i talk with my uh developers and how to do in the right way so that's a big part of the job also um like figuring out what should be done like how to solve problems for users how to make the experience uh smoother or more more fun lots and lots of things are done behind the scenes and so we only see a little bit of code us on the front side of things um that these edo and his team are writing hundreds of lines of code so and they're having a lot of fun when they do it yep and always problem solving along the way because there's nothing worse than when you get through finishing your code and finding you have an error or it doesn't work so well as you immediately assumed it would yeah so what do you think you do is the most challenging part of starting your own company um i would say um when you're starting a new company working on just an idea that you had and it's hard to try to convince other people that your idea is valid and that um something you thought about would uh be interesting to people like in the early days we would get feedback like either from other developers or teachers everyone had like their own idea of like um how you're supposed to enter code because that's the way they learned to code or that's like the um that's the experience they had and like you know just um you need you do need to learn to listen to other people but you do need to have a certain pride and just be sure of what you're doing um yeah because otherwise you just end up doing something that's already been done so you gotta like uh you gotta uh you gotta be able to trust your gut so yeah and that's and that's a challenge sometimes people don't always like when you trust your gut even though it's the right way right um yeah you're like as a as a founder you're like uh you're taking a risk like uh you're in many cases uh you leave a job that you have to try something that might work and might leave you out of the job in a few months uh but yeah i've been uh i've been privileged to go with my idea and and uh try it out and uh yeah and it worked out what do you think what has been the most meaningful from your experience of starting your own company um well i guess um i really enjoy um i really enjoying students who like getting feedback from students getting feedback from kids um i enjoy seeing what kids do on the game builder there's so many uh creative uh ways students are using the game builder that i like didn't think were possible so it's really cool to see someone build on top of your ideas like understand what you were doing and understand how to use a tool you created and just using it and working on top of on that and learning in the process um it's great you know like uh it's great to know that uh could have affected uh some kids uh who got a kick out of coding thanks to the code market yeah and actually on that on that note um how many people weston asked this question about how many people a day do you think play code monkey um i'd have to look at the numbers think it's like uh tens of thousands now in that area depends if it's the school year or not and uh yeah hopefully we'll get uh like hundreds of thousands a day uh in uh hour of code great it's our favorite event of the year we know that um okay so the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to transition from questions to the from the audience so these are questions that our audience asked when they registered for today's event and so this first question comes from miss jonakowski sorry if i said your name incorrectly i'm from homer illinois what was your favorite what were your favorite subjects in school my favorite subject in school um i guess in high school i didn't learn coding in middle school because like this i was in school like about 20 15 years ago and then i only started to learn coding in high school and uh yeah i was really into that um i had just a little experience as i said in flash but we were learning a language called ascot and i actually remember like we got in the computer room and uh and we had like an assignment like to make some kind of program that does something i don't remember what was the test but i just remember like finishing it early and then doing like uh like something fun with code um yeah so that was fun if you don't know what pascal language is definitely recommend you googling it check out what that language is it's one of the beginning languages right it's an oldfashioned one yeah it's uh i think if you like to read you can read some pascal and like if you've coded before you can kind of get what things what it's up to but it's uh yeah definitely looks great if you learned like copyscript the javascript great um this one comes from i believe miss lily from new york alabama what is the hardest part of coding um so there are many hard parts in uh cutting what is the hardest part well there's like a kind of it's yeah bugs are hard uh mostly if you ask coders there's a thing called usually they would say something like naming things so uh i guess if you uh maybe if you did again game builder you maybe sometimes have to name a thing meaning like um i don't know name a character but this character can be uh the villain but then it can also be the the hero or you know just naming concepts figuring out like what a part of the code does is uh and how to just give it a very descriptive name so a lot of much of much about coding is just um being able to write code that other humans can understand not other not only other not only the machine can understand but also other humans can read what you did and understand so so that part is hard so yeah i totally agree sometimes i look at i'm not a very good coder so i'm just a very beginner coder but sometimes when i look into the people's codes when they're doing a sprint which is a lot of a very long coding project and you look and you see there's it's very overwhelming you see how much code goes into there so i can totally understand why it's important to be descriptive not only for your team but for other people this one comes from miss simmons from pamal i don't even know how to say that uh city so sorry about that from pennsylvania that part i do know um what types of careers do you think are available in coding uh that's a good question so i guess i took one career path which was uh like at the beginning of code monkey i was uh doing most of the coding and then we grew and i like what i do now is mostly manage other developers but i do i do still write some code myself um so that's one career path just being a developer and then maybe manage other developers once you have enough experience there are other career paths so some developers become product managers which are basically the people who decide uh what to code like what should the product look like like what should the game look like what should the dashboard for the teacher look like so they usually need to understand a bit of coding because they work with uh coders um and then like a third one i can think of is um working with data so we have someone in the company uh we learned computer science and is now doing marketing but in this day and age uh like so much of the marketing is done online and it's with data and uh you need to learn you need to know how to code like how to work with that data then they can say like uh people in uruguay are interested in coding maybe you should put an advertisement for them you know or something like uh everyone like challenge 25 in coding adventure is too hard because 50 of uh people who started don't finish it so all these things like in many cases require a little bit of coding to to get the insight out of the data so you're saying you have to understand some data which i know lots of you learn in your daytoday schooling and it plays some plays quite a bit of an importance in the coding side of things right um yeah like data and coding are really like um you can't have one well i guess you can have data without coding but you kind of coding without data everything is about um yeah numbers and text and uh you know things like that i agree and i know that in our company and we talked about this in our other webinar that there are other sides in a company that does coding as well like myself i work with professionals i work with teachers and training them and there's other people who work on the advertisements for code monkey and what you see on the webpage and all the graphics so there's lots of big lots of teams but knowing a little bit of code helps get your foot in the door with all of these coding platforms and we know that digital is where i mean you're interacting with us virtually right now too um so we have mrs miss lomb liam barker excuse me i see somebody said there was their teacher um in skillman new jersey and her question was um what types of careers are available um oh whoops i messed that up they would like to know if you have any advice for third and fourth graders to be successful um so i guess it's it would be um well i would say i would split my advice to two i was uh um you have to work hard like you have to uh you have to study and you have to uh get in the details and you shouldn't be afraid um to fail because when you do coding and when you learn uh things that are hard like math uh it's gonna be hard so uh um so be ready to like uh to study art for that but also um i guess the other part of that is um is find your passion so like i guess i was uh lucky that yeah my passion led me in a good career path but it's that you can you gotta work on something that you're passionate about i agree and i think also what you mentioned earlier about trusting your gut i think is also something important because sometimes we think we're interested in something and sometimes you give it a try and it might not just be the right thing so i think also you said something about being able to handle failure is a big piece of all of that as well um so this next one comes from miss watts in cartersville georgia how can block coding benefit students rather than just doing textbased coding like python or javascript so um block coding is um is helpful is uh it's a very um it's a good entry point for young kids uh to get into the world of logic and uh uh codemonkey started out as a completely textbased um platform we only did games that made you type uh use the keyboard like a real programmer and um it is a very important um aspect of coding uh like no like real world quarters i use like this drag and drop interface and uh the reason is they are limited there are they become a crotch at some point um so it's like it's a barrier that eventually if uh people really want to understand and know how to code you gotta uh get across the drag and drop interfaces into uh textbased coding programming languages but text base is harder than dragon drop and blockly platform so yeah so it's a good entry point um but i recommend uh looking at the text basis like uh the next thing and uh that's the next step i would agree yeah i do think the block base tends to be easier but it also helps you learn exactly what you're saying it's a really great next step for learning how to code because now you've learned all the computational thinking and now you know how things kind of work together so it kind of lays the foundation i think for the next we have this question here what is the difference in our chat what's the difference between javascript and python so javascript and python are two programming language so you could ask i could say what what a programming language is so a programming language is kind of like uh like two programming languages refer like to human languages the first so french and english are two different languages they can both express you can both use you can use either french or english to say something like uh i'm hungry i want to eat a burger but these are you would say differently in french um so two programming languages are yeah they're equal in the way they can do the same thing usually in most cases but they look different and behave differently so python and javascript are different programming language they both can solve like almost entirely the same problems but they do it differently but it's and it's a big but javascript is the only languages language that can run in a browser so if you're thinking of doing a project if you're thinking of starting your own website and putting out this like a small uh game on the website you will have a much harder time doing that on python you should learn javascript but if you have other concerns then look into python that's a good tip why do you think this is from miss c in austin texas actually where i am why is it important do you think for students to learn how to code um so learning how to go first of all it's um as we like talked about people have asked yeah it's a good skill to have as we said like if you're thinking about uh like careerwise but uh even if you don't like i'm thinking of that i think it's it's good to know um some coding because like we're using a program now and we're just like so much of our life is digital and i think it's uh important to just be aware of how these things work and like um just understanding things like uh what's a bug like bugs can be like um they can be like very serious things like in a digital world right they can stop a classroom like a lesson from happening they can stop uh cars from working like bugs are like uh very important so i think it's important people know like how code works and like what does it mean like to have a bug it's important for people like to understand um how the internet works and how their information is uh how their information is used and can be used and what it means for uh their security i think it's important to like just because so much of our world is digital um it should not be people shouldn't uh look at it as like complete magic that is unexplainable because it is explainable like it's all been written by people who went to school and learned how to code and they just wrote it and there are and they're just that they're just people sometimes make mistake and it's important that everyone like kind of understand what is going on in the digital world i agree and cyber security has been the hot button issue for quite some time especially from this coveted pandemic so it's good to hear that you also share that insight of the importance of it i'm going to take one question here from our q a this is a fun one do you think if you hadn't gotten into code monkey that you would have pursued a career in music i thought about it uh before i went to school so uh uh i was actually so i'm from israel and i was in the army as most uh uh israelis who turned 18 go to the army so when i got out at 21 uh i was thinking about a career in music um but i guess it was kind of like what i talked about before about passions so i was enjoying music but i wasn't really passionate enough to make it my living especially in music it's very hard to make a living out of it so now music is just a hobby for me and i'm glad that i'm glad i'm doing what i'm doing right now and uh sounds like you're still very passionate about coding so it's good to it's good to be able to share that um yeah so it's uh it's actually ever in everything you you do for a living uh i think you can find like aspects of it that do excite you so yeah i wasn't always like it wasn't always uh fun working on code marketing there have been hard times and there have been times that i had to do something maybe a little boring or like that but yeah i think it's um i think it's important that you do something like you focus on the area in your work that uh you are passionate about i think that's i think that's important to to keep in mind that you might not always love it 100 all the time but it still gives you that you still know what you're i think it's important to know what your true north is and it sounds like you do know what that is um this question comes from mr oman in uh converse texas oh another texas what qualities or skills do you think is important to obtain in this field and i think you mentioned failure obviously um maybe even the ability to communicate with other people um and maybe even take some feedback do you have anything else that you think are some important features that kids or skills qualities they should have yeah i mean you said it perfectly i think communication is is uh underrated there's like this um i guess this uh false ideal of a programmer that is completely false but like sometimes you would see movies like a programmer just sitting alone at this desk just typing for uh the whole night and just coming up and oh yes i made it i like hacked the mainframe or i uh wrote facebook in a day or something like that but that is so uh out of touch with reality the reality of coding is just being able to communicate with your peers and being respectful of other people's opinion about your work and being able to communicate to your peers about their work and give feedback and get feedback those are the riches of of good programmers not like being able to like uh crunch like just be alone with the computer all day and write code all night that's that's not that's not a good lifestyle it's true you have to have a little bit of variance from that um so in the effort of time we're going to take one more question from our audience that we had here and i think this is probably my most favorite and best question why did you name code monkey code monkey um so as i talked about before about the conversations we had me and jonathan had um i guess i was i kind of like monkeys they're cute my partner see she also really likes monkeys she used to volunteer with monkeys in south america once and uh i guess i was just thinking about monkeys monkeys uh were just in my head and then we thought about uh doing like a game that is like having a character move across the screen and then there there was this term code monkey which is like kind of means a bad thing like uh like a coder that's like not really uh excited about what it what they do um but i thought it would be cute to give like a twist of like no it's just it's a cute little monkey and he's collecting bananas and that's it's a game and i like it's all like um like all the puzzle pieces came together and like it made a lot of sense a lot of sense to just have the character a monkey have the name uh code monkey and just go with that we're happy that we did make code monkey into more of a fun term than what it was originally used for so we just want to round out today by telling all of you and sharing all of your experiences with us today and making sure you had your questions there were so many great questions that all of you asked beforehand thank you so much to ido as well for sharing your story with all of our audience and especially because we know it is pretty late there in israel so we're glad that he was able to join us and spend some time and share your stories and we hope that this sparks some joy for you whether you decide you want to become a computer programmer or you just want to explore owning your own business someday hopefully you had some really great takeaways we want to thank you guys so much again for joining us during the hour of code week the best week in our opinion of the whole year um so we hope you check out us on our hour of code through code.org or on our own webpage and you check out our new space adventure course it's one of our favorite what's better than being in space you know you can can code in space and maybe eventually elon musk will take you to space so you never know where that will take you um so thank you again everybody and thank you so much to our team brett molly and ido of course the shining star of today's webinar um and as always write code catch bananas and save the world we'll see you guys next time bye everybody
