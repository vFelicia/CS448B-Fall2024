okay all right awesome so yeah today our main focus is going to be how to use Code Monkey for teachers why is it important for teachers to have the opportunity to be able to utilize Code Monkey um and we'll just go ahead and jump straight into it so let me go ahead and share my screen here all right alrighty yeah okay can everyone see my screen Molly you can see it excellent okay perfect awesome um and Lauren Amy uh cleansing have any of you had the chance to look at some of our curriculum um online maybe utilizing our free trial is this looking all new to everyone yes I'm on the free trial and I've been looking at Code Monkey Junior specifically for some preschoolers gotcha okay Amy anything on your end basically it's like uh new for you as well okay perfect so we'll just start here from the beginning um so right here for some of our younger students kindergarten first second grade we start them off with block based coding um this is really our bread and butter for Code Monkey we started 12 years ago we focused on Block Base and Tech space for elementary school students we're currently providing Code Monkey for k through eight we even have some high schools that use us as well because of we do offer python but what separates Code Monkey from other platforms such as you know code.org for instance is the way that we're introducing these topics so you can't just jump Straight Ahead uh into textbased coding or into the 20th lesson within Block Base you have to prove your conceptual understanding in each one of those lessons come fluidly so students aren't getting stuck right they're having fun they're engaged and I'll show you what this looks like here quickly so Code Monkey Junior as we can see here if it wants to load this is going to be Challenge number five all right I'm going to mute that and as you can see here if you were in kindergarten or first grade and you jump straight into Challenge number five you wouldn't know what to do right this looks a little bit Advanced uh and again this is Challenge number five so students wouldn't see this they would first start off something very basic challenge number one uh drag and drop block based introduction and then each one of these lessons we're going to introduce um a new piece to block coding and our goal is to get students into actually writing code um as quickly as possible and I'll show you what this looks like on a higher level here so we're going to jump into our text base here we go all right so this is called coding adventures part one and this is where Elementary School students are actually going to be writing code as you can see here this looks very Advanced similar concept this is Challenge number 41. um we do have these tutorial videos but we notice most students probably aren't going to watch the tutorial right so uh we're gonna start students at a very basic introduction especially when they're moving right from block into text and I'll show you what this looks like here so we have a little animation we'll skip that just for time again we do have our our first steps tutorial here step 15. it's pointing at uh run so we'll go ahead and click it all right we got that correct we're not sure why we just click run and now it's telling us hey you can change the amount of steps we'll click run it's not correct it says use step 15 we're still not sure why but we're going to go ahead and change that to 15. foreign we've accomplished that and now we have our tutorial video again let's pretend that we don't want to watch that we'll click OK and now if you look on your left hand side you'll see this animation built right in telling us to grab that ruler uh and that's going to tell us how many steps that we need to make so again it's very selfpaced for the students hands off for the teachers and now we know this is going to be 20 steps so this is just an example of how our program works Code Monkey was created with the understanding most teachers don't have a coding background and they don't need to for this to work although we do have a ton of teacher resources as well I'd say it's kind of a 50 50 split so some teachers they want to utilize these resources and learn along with their students or maybe they took a class in college they want to brush up well we have that available so we have tons of lesson plans and we also have coding Concepts media and graphic and most importantly the solutions so we have the and users to every single question on our platform so I know you mentioned um The Code Monkey Junior earlier well we can go right here we could say hey there's a few students that are stuck on Challenge number 15 well as a teacher we can click right into it um and now we're able to see exactly how to solve so we'll go back here so as a teacher um the teacher dashboard is obviously very important and here we can choose our specific class we'll go with Mr Allen's class and now at a bird's eye view we can see all of our students we can see their progress we can look at proficiency overall um and then we also have our gradebook you can assign quizzes if you'd like that will expire at a certain time they have to complete it let's say by the end of April for Code Monkey Junior part one for instance and then we can see exactly um how they're scoring there we can do letters we can do numbers we can do percent uh and then your quizzes are right here if you do want to assign those um so as we mentioned coding Adventure we can choose an end date you can try it yourself if you'd like if we go back to progress you can also click on a specific student so let's see we want more information on Dan well with one click now we can see how much time they spent again their proficiency how many solutions how many courses they've started challenges games uh and the course progress here we can choose a specific area and do it that way and then we can export the data the data file and then we can also limit progress here so that's a question we get all the time is hey so do students just get on and they just play as far as they can go not necessarily we can limit that progress have students focus on a specific topic and then we can add that quiz if we would like so what questions do you all have so far if any if any it's okay if we don't nothing all right Molly is there anything that uh you've that you'd like to add here on the teacher dashboard uh no no okay um another important piece is we integrate with a variety of ssos so if you're using classlink Google classrooms even clever we do have the opportunity for you to to roster even a full integration with the site license um with clever just to make that a very seamless process for you in addition we're offering professional development and that's what one of our Code Monkey professional development Specialists why is that important well we know each School each district sometimes each classroom is going to be different as far as what you're trying to accomplish so we want to discuss hey how can we optimize code monkeys features and functionalities to meet your specific goals and objectives so you'll have a preliminary phone call and then we'll have a 60minute webinar with the specialist with your teachers or administrators um to talk about all of those details in addition have a customer experience manager the duration of your subscription so when you need support you don't have to go and and potentially wait 48 hours for an email response you do have that that onetoone um support so whether it's questions with rostering or just about some of our curriculum in general you do have that dedicated customer experience manager as well as Molly and I so kind of the full package um is there anything else that you guys would like to discuss here today I have a question if you don't mind about getting students logged in I noticed under the students tab you have the print student login cards um and when I do you see that from your experience especially with younger students do teachers just post that link to like a Google classroom or a seesaw or some sort of um system so that students can quickly access it and then use their login do they create QR codes what have you kind of found yeah Molly what do you think is the most popular yeah if you want um Tyler if you want to click on the students tab um on yep so Lauren where you were referring to you have the print student login card so with that it's going to print your class roster with your students uh username or login information as well as their password so if you wanted to go that route you'd print it out and then you'd cut out each card and give that to their Stu to your students so that they can keep that and refer to each time that they are logging in if you're doing the classroom login URL then that is something that you would put up on your whiteboard or post somewhere and then students to go to that URL directly and then log in with our own username or passwords that they either have saved on their computer or that they've memorized for younger students I'm using a simple username and very simple password is what we would recommend if you are not using single signon such as their Google email addresses or clever um and then as you can see here if you are using a username and password you also have the ability to reset passwords for students so if they don't remember their password or if maybe the password they've set up is just a little too tricky for them you can reset it to a simpler password that'll make it easier for them thank you um another feature here thank you Molly is our admin dashboard um so we typically will have just one admin but I believe Molly you can have a couple admins now that's a new feature is that correct correct yes um so here if you were one of the admins or V admin this would be the area where you can look at everything as well all of your schools um active students past six weeks and then we can click the teachers tab um and look at all the teachers and then here if you have multiple schools we can add a school um and then also add your classrooms or upload a classroom um and then you can add coteachers too and then we have our assignments Tab and now we can see for each of these schools or classrooms well you can filter it by teacher classroom or school and we can see exactly what's being um assigned to each classroom teacher or school and then we can edit that um and assign or or unassign all so offers you the flexibility from that perspective um one piece I did want to mention on the courses which is really exciting this is something that's been added um I don't know maybe the past six months or so we wanted to be more allencompassing when it comes to computer science in general to meet those State Standards so we're csta aligned um and we are not just coding so we are offering digital literacy this is targeted towards really third through sixth grade um and then we also have our dodo does math as you can see so this is specifically focusing on distances angles multiplications we also have a mini course so it's completely up to the teacher we see this used as um maybe a week every two months or a month out of the year we're going to focus specifically on math or digital literacy so it's broken down into um two pieces here so we have digital use which is roughly a semester long and digital citizen Citizenship which is another semester so students can use this year after year and not necessarily run out of material why is this important well digital use as you can imagine this is going to focus on um you know what's the difference between tablets and desktops and um uh keyboard and typing component even Hardware software browsers and then the digital citizenship is going to focus more on hey um how can I be a good person on the internet really so or as it's phrased how to thrive as a digital citizen so most importantly I feel is our cyber bullying component here and again this is third fourth fifth and sixth grade students just because there is a specific reading comprehension um limit there so just wanted to point that out that has been a very uh popular addition to our platform and this is available for doesn't matter if you have just a small classroom license or a districtwide implementation this is going to be available um for everyone so all right any other questions no okay well thank you very much for tuning in everyone again this is will be saved and I can email it over to you all if you'd like to look back at it um you also have my email and Molly's if you have any further questions we're happy to assist always happy to jump on another call um and if you do have an interest for next school year happy to provide quotes again anything you all need so thank you very much for your time and we hope to engage with you all again soon bye bye everyone
