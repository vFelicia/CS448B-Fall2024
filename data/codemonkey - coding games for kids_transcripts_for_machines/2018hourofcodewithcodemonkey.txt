all righty hello everyone thank you for attending the 2018 hour of code webinar we know that how many choices you have for the hour of code and we thank you for choosing us after today's session we will send you out a form for you to fill out in which you will receive PD credit for today's webinar if you have any questions during today's session please send them in the Q&A or in the chat box along the side also follow us on twitter or on instagram at at code monkey estu and then hashtag code monkey webinar my team is going to be joining us so if you like I said if you have any questions in the cap and the chat box or in the Q&A section all right and we're gonna get started remember to write code catch bananas and save the world all right so hour of code 2018 so who are we so today I'm gonna introduce my team that's joining us first I'll just start out with myself my name is lina saleh and i am the professional development manager here at code monkey so i do all of the trainings for teachers and all of the online webinars hi everyone my name is Zach I'm the director of sales I may know a lot of you as you are current clients of code monkey and we appreciate you joining us today and also joining us for the remainder of the year I'm here to say hello to everyone know so to just tell you that our of code is a great start for some people it's a great push for your students to get them invigorated for coding but if any of you are interested in furthering your coding in your school I'm the guy to speak to I'll be mentioning something at the end of the webinar but taken and Lina is gonna do a great job and if you want to do more coding I'll be in touch with you after the webinar we also have Zoe Diane she is our marketing and media manager I have her here in this little monkey trophy because she is our rock star here at could lucky alright so let's go ahead and do it sorry and I would like to see you all here today and best of luck Lena okay so first we're just gonna start off with talking about what is the hour of code I'm sure most of you that are joining obviously know a little bit of hour of code but I just wanted to give you a kind of a glimpse into it so the hour of code is basically not a place where students are learning how to code it's giving them that exposure and the access to computer science so when it was originally designed it was designed to basically show students how fun coding is and just basically opening a window or kind of you know giving the picked big picture in the background for students and showing them how fun and interactive it can be so I like to share this graphic here along the Sakai I think co.org did a really great job in making this graphic here and kind of doing a lot of the research that they've done with computer science so here we have the percentage of female high school students that had no prior computer science experience prior to the hour of code and when they interviewed them about 55 percent of students said that they liked computer science and after during the hour of code seventyfive percent of the students now really enjoyed or liked computer science so that's basically the goal of the hour of code is to get your students jazzed about the hour of code and about what coding can be okay so let's talk about where can you find us so you can find us at code.org slash learn and I'm going to show you that here in a second or you can also find us at wwlp.com backslash our dash of dash code and you'll find all of our courses there and then we also have our teacher notes alongside that so I'll get into a little bit more about what that is and what they look like here as we get started like I said if you have any questions along the way please feel free to ask them and we'll do our best to answer them we'll also have some time at the end for some Q&A so here are five courses that we have we have the trivia chat bot moon lander dota does math coding adventure and game builder and I'm gonna discuss in more detail what each of these courses look like because I know that many of you joining us are joining us from different age levels and different areas of the teaching spectrum so I want to be able to talk about each and every single one of those so our hour of code courses like I said we currently have five courses our coding adventure course is our beginning beginners course so it walks all the students in a linear manner through all of our coding concepts and this is geared for grades seven through six then we have our dota does math and so basically every single of our courses after coding adventure requires the students to have a little bit of background experience as far as coding goes coding adventure like I said as our beginners course so dota does math as our second through fourth grade and this talks about has many math concepts in it it has distances angles and multiplication and the students work through coding concepts to solve these types of problems game builder is our interactive like exactly what it says a game builder course then we have a Python chat bot and those are geared for our older grades and so the game builder is fifth through ninth the Python chat bot is seventh through ninth and then our last course is moon lander and moon lander is an interactive it's also very fun but geared more towards the older grade levels more advanced coding it is a little bit more challenging so we'll talk about that just know that with any of these courses just because the gradelevel says second through sixth grade does not mean that an eighth grade student cannot attempt to take coding adventure we'll talk a little bit more about that but basically through coding adventure the monkey will go through catching bananas and sometimes middle school students will find that a little bit too babyish or sometimes they'll love it it just depends on the scope and sequence of the kids okay so moving right along um I love this graphic here on the lefthand side so this is what we want our classrooms to look like the cousins on the righthand side when preparing for the hour of code we want it to be very calm and easygoing and everyone is working together and it's in a seamless manner and so I as I'm sure any of you as teachers have had these moments where it looks like you think you have everything under control and then there's a fire and you've got to put it out so I learned this the hard way the very first year that I set up the hour of code I organized it for my whole school I was a stem teacher for a k8 school and basically I was the T in the stem and so we had we decided to set up an hour of code with all of our students and we very quickly realized that there was a lot of troubleshooting that wasn't was involved with it and at this time it was back in 2012 there weren't as many expansive coding courses as there are now and so we didn't really have anything in the background or really let our volunteers know what to do so in the second year we tested all of our devices we made sure that everything kind of works seamlessly and that our volunteers had kind of some background troubleshooting to go with so basically what we did is we decided when to host your event so you want to decide when you want to host your event a lot of schools um internationally will host them after school to do really good community building some schools will host it during school during having an hour of code this is a great time to introduce to bring in parent volunteers parents love to help and so this is what better way then to have them during the hour of code when you have hundreds of devices working all at one time always like I said Tessa picking out code code monkey works on or our our platform works on Chromebooks iPads MacBooks hardwired computers there's no downloading there's no flash so it really works well on a lot of devices just making sure that your browsers are up to date because that's really important and then like I said invite your parents to come in I'm going to show you some really great resources to share with your parent volunteers or even bringing volunteers from the community like local businesses they have a lot of times where they have volunteer hours and they love to help especially during these times so you give them those and then we have some hour of code notes that I'll share with you and then I would recommend having especially if you're like a librarian or even having your volunteers set up the computer so that when the students come in they spend the entire hour coding we want them to have as much exposure and as much fun during this time as possible so those are just some really important things to kind of keep in mind when setting up for the hour of code ok so now we're going to explore our courses what the courses look like and the teacher notes that are involved with them sorry just getting these notes here and then we're gonna get moving okay so we're gonna start out with our very first course and so how we access these courses so you can go to code org backslash learn like I had mentioned before and over here on the left hand side and the created by section you can go to code monkey and when you do so you'll see that there is a beginner and there is a comfortable and the beginner and like I said suggests a coding adventure is our beginners course now it does increase in complexity if you go beyond just the hour of code and then the comfortable version meaning we want our students to have some background knowledge with coding beforehand so that's how you can access the courses and with each of these courses there is this short link here and so the short link is really great to even do something like a bitly or maybe a QR code that's really easy for your iPad's to just go straight to it um whatever you think kind of works for you but really making sure that you launch those beforehand so let's start out with our coding adventure course and when you click on the beginner in the coding adventure course it'll bring you here to the screen I've already brought it up just for I'm x purposes here and underneath underneath each and every single one of our courses we have teachers notes and then we have full lesson plans so with coding adventure that comes with our free teacher trial which we'll talk about a little bit at the end but that does give you the exposure to the lesson plans that are involved with those as well and so underneath the coding adventure when I click Boop sorry I wanted to go to the teacher notes so let's go back here to the free teacher notes so we'll click here on the teacher notes and underneath will will it'll give you what the course is about and so in coding adventure the goal is that the monkey is there students are learning coding concepts through playing gamified version of monkey collecting bananas and as he goes along he's like I said learning the coding concepts in a linear manner so the kids aren't skipping around or kind of doing any of that the age specifications are here if you want to look at any of those but basically what I said you definitely need internet you need to make sure that headphones are definitely recommended we have some really fun sounds that are associated with those then the programming language that we use for dota does math and coding adventure is CoffeeScript and so CoffeeScript is a just a much easier version of JavaScript it's basically the context without all of the syntax surrounding it so it just makes it much easier for the students to learn and then we'll talk about how the challenges are scored and then just know that all of our all of our courses are common core and CTS aligned and we're working on some other alignments as we as we go through here and then how to prep for the hour of code there are those certificates remember at the end of the hour of code that you can print out for your students I suggest making those ahead of time printing those off we all know how much students are driven by certificates and they love them even the older grades this is a great reference card that I shared with my parent volunteers in my classroom and so I just let them know so if a student were to ask for help instead of giving them an answer we're not giving them an answer during this time we just want them to try it so we're mostly just having our volunteers basically give words of encouragement like I don't know that's great question let's what can you do to figure that out and so we're just really encouraging them to go through and depending on how much experience your students have some of them may finish the course in under an hour and so we can encourage them to go to the other courses as we kind of go along okay so let's go ahead and let's start playing I'm going to show you a couple challenges from each and every single one of our courses we get moving here for coding adventure and oh that as map there is a trailer that goes alongside of it it's super cute I'm for the essence of time I'm not going to show it we do have this new narration feature here if you turn off the narration feature within the settings then the narration feature will not pop up so just making sure that you know that if that happens for troubleshooting reasons like I said there's some fun noises so I'm just going to turn the noises down a little bit I still want you to be able to hear them but that feature and in the teacher notes it'll tell you exactly what Gordo does and so Gordo is our teacher assistant he gives all of the directions and encouragement when a student pass a challenge and then I also wanted to notice that we do have many languages here and so the directions will be in their native language but the coding is always in the same language okay it's always and it's always CoffeeScript CoffeeScript doesn't change okay very beginning of coding adventure it starts very simply when you hit run it's showing it's introducing students to the platform and then they'll get a scoring system so basically in a shortened version of this a 3star means they wrote the shortest most concise code to star solution means when they were able to take what they learned and a onestar solution means it took them a very long time very long process to code it basically we don't want our students writing up 100 lines of code when they can solve it in two because when you become a true computer programmer nobody wants to be spending up much time writing that much extra steps of coding okay so then we go to our next challenge and like I said dota or Gordo gave us a little bit extra and so that's what the narration feature looks like and so here we have monkey and it also tells them but we have monkey you can pick up the ruler we can measure we can use the different tools and so in this case monkey needs to step 15 and so if I write this drag this out here this is going to yield a two star solution because I could have changed it to step 15 and so if you see that or encourage your volunteers to see this scoring system if you're using this in the elementary classroom or whatever say oh well how do you think you could get three stars for this challenge so just kind of just encouraging them as they go along I am going to skip ahead here to challenge number 30 so you can take a look at what does it look like at the end of the course so sorry let me just quickly quickly login here or I won't be able to skip ahead so your you'll notice your students will try to skip ahead and they cannot skip ahead unless they've had the access to do so and you can access this through the story mode or change it here and so as you can see in challenge number 30 there is no code written here so we're needing the students to figure out how to write the code and because I've already done this and you'll notice too the code gets quite challenging and in this here the students are actually doing loops so it says loop lance and students will have to be learning what a loop is and so if you don't know what a loop is it's a repetition of sum up steps and so here we're saying that 3 times the monkey will step 10 step back 10 and then the turtle that's why this is associated here this is an object so we've programmed the turtle to move the turtle then to step 10 and monkey will repeat the steps so let me show you what that looks like you and Humberto Neumann and so you ask how is the criterion to assign one two or three stars and so in the teacher's guide it details a little bit more about what the one star to star in three star solutions will look like and in the actual teacher dashboard once you have a teacher trial it will also show you how students stuff is scored so we can talk about that and I can show you that here at the end so I'll get back to your question here soon okay and so with coding adventure you get challenges one through thirty for the for the next one and so that's what coding adventure looks like so they're catching it and it's super fun they love the noises and what better way than catching bananas so dota does math here is like I said coding concepts and so let me show you what the teacher notes look like and I'm sorry if I'm going a little bit fast but I want to be able to show you all five of our courses so the same thing dota those math it's an interactive our still webbased still Chromebook compatible same thing the scoring system for dota does math is exactly the same as coding adventure and so three stars means that you did it in the shortest most concise two star means that you incorporated what you did and picked up all of the eggs and then onestart means that to be a much longer journey basically to catch the eggs here GTS aligned as well there's still the certificates and they'll be seeing a little bit different buttons here encoding adventure and iris aren't in dough to this math and they're actually using real world tools here okay so they're using a protractor a ruler to do that so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna start playing them and introduce you to a couple of the lessons there still are a couple of the challenges there's a video here too this one's super cute basically dodo laces eggs on a turtle shell and the turtle moves away and so dodo is left to collect his eggs so this starts out super basic introducing the students to how a ruler works and it is set up like a real ruler and we all know that our students struggle with how to do measurements so just keeping that in mind so here the kids learn to use a reallife blue ruler it's not always an exact amount they learn also how to read a protractor a reallife protractor and using the measurement and so I'll show you that let me turn down this sound here because it can be like I said overwhelming sometimes especially when you're trying to speak and then I like I said they're exposing them to measurement and they're getting its really this one is very much stem integrated okay so in this case here we need to pick up the eggs and for the exact measurement and it gave us a tutorial and so I'll pick up the ruler and this is where it's measuring and it's telling me that I need to step eight instead of step zero so in this case he's now step eight we use the ruler it's not always exact sometimes there's a lot more complexity that goes is associated with that okay and you can see here this is a story map and so we have this for coding adventure and dota this map mmm dota does map in which you can see how the students moved in because I've obviously already solved this we can access different challenges so I'm gonna go to challenge number four here within the distances and measurement and we can see that this one actually has the distances laid out for us but the students have to do some math here so it's saying okay we need to add and so I need to step that distance and then I'll need to pick up the egg and so when I do so I had to add the distances together if I had done something I'll just quickly show you since some of the questions have been surrounding this what does it mean it look like so I added those two together to get a three star solution this will yield me a to a 1 star solution because I didn't do it in the shortest most concise way here okay so those are just some ways to kind of understand that concept and then as we move along we go into we go into angles and measurement and so here you can see they not all of them are blank this is just an application of what they've learned from the days before and so they'll have to figure out ok how do I use this how do I use the protractor so we can see where he is you can turn it and actually use the reallife measurement here we can see okay how far do we need to step and so this one's a little bit more complicated in that manner and so we turn 65 here you can see it in between okay so I turned 65 then I had to actually in this one use both the protractor and the ruler to get to where I need it to be and we're using some of the coding concepts from coding adventure so your students can start using coding adventure and it gives them all of the tools that they need to succeed for any of our courses and there were two eggs here so I needed to pick up both of the eggs but the distance measurement look like and then let me show you just one more about what the multiplication will look like so this one is more so skip counting so dodo has to throw the lobsters to walk across the lobsters to get to the end because if dodo just starts walking he's going to drought so I can debug this and figure out that I don't have enough and so I'll need to throw the lobster distance of 20 and then I'll need to pick up the egg so for the purpose of time we can see that I threw 20 lobsters and I will now need to step the distance of 20 to get to the end and so in these in DotA does math it's not just the coding it's also math so there's a lot of thinking involved inside the dough does math course so if you're really wanting to challenge your students definitely recommend doing this especially I taught fifth grade and my students don't know multiplication I actually don't even know how it didn't know how to use the tools and so I used this course actually as a supplementation to some of the things that I was teaching because even though this says hour of code and it's available during the week of computer science it's actually available all year round so why not utilize it why you can okay moving right along to our next course here so our next course that we're going to take a look at is game builder so you can already see right away that game builder looks different than any of the other ones that we've done before okay so in game builder there are three screens you can see this here there is the directions then we have our text editor which if you're not sure what a familiar a text editor is where you write your code and then over here is we have our scene or basically the action of what's happening and so this will start out very basic there's a lot of reading that's involved with this and so making sure that that's why it's a look for a little bit older grade levels as well as a lot of thinking here and so it starts out super simple and in this one we have where you're coding but you're also playing so the students will code the code here and then they'll also play so they can also see what's happening but also play so in this one we're saying when we're programming the object of the monkey here and this is asking us to program him to step one and so when I attached the app to it means that I am programming these are matching so I'm programming the monkey to go with him and when I do so now I'm going to move him the banana so there's some fun noises as well here in some encouragement that goes alongside it and it continues to grow and so here it says I need to use the keyboard right so right now what's inside of my coat is it saying that when I push this on key which is the Run button if the keyboard which is the arrow right is pressed then he will earth the arrow left he'll step backwards and then now I need to program him to step right so what I am gonna do for the sake of this obviously you want to encourage your students to write this out but you can also copy and paste and now I'm saying if I push left he'll go back if I push right he'll go forward and so we can see here that now he's moving forward and backwards to get to the banana and I'm just following the directions that are over here on the left hand side of the screen and so when they get to the very end here it gets a little bit the students start adding different parts to the world they add sprites and bananas and that kind of a thing inside and you can design it so they're designing and they're playing and they're coding all at the same time so it's really great and interactive and really middle schoolers love this one I love it they love it and what student doesn't want to design their own game and so here it'll walk you through all of that I'm just going to show my solution there's a lot to this one you're programming different parts and you're programming the banana and the monkey and so there's different so you're these are sprites like you've heard in scratch I'm sure before so you're programming the sprites here to get to it and what happens when we get to it is we're trying to collect the bananas and jumping and we do all kinds of things inside of this one so this one's really fun and probably will take students a little bit longer than an hour and that's totally fine okay moving along to our next course so now we went over three courses coding adventure doted as and game builder and now we're going on to a fourth course which is moon lander and then I'll try to wrap this up because we said only 30 minutes obviously for quicker so in moon lander the goal of moon lander here is that we are using physics integration so it was developed for an Israeli cyber competition and basically you learn what gravity and thrust is and how to increase and decrease thrust and gravity and how much is needed basically to move through this world so they are still doing lots of coding concepts like event handlers and functions and loops if you're really into computer programming this would be great this one is very similar to the game builder in which you're playing and coding at the same time and so I'm just gonna go we'll just look at this one here and so you have to control and to me this one is I'm not very good with really good at the coding I'm not very good at the gameplay and so I can't pass this challenge actually and I played it a lot of times and so the goal is to land here and that's kind of how this goes and so you can see it's very complex lots of components are involved in this one last but not least we have our trivia chat bot ok same thing we have our instructions our code in the centre and on the right hand side students if they're looking for something there's their first time coding the chat bot might not be as fun but if you're a computer science teacher this is perfect you're using real Python and who doesn't want to learn Python in this way than in the traditional environment and it is guided in a step by step and they're not exactly learning everything but it's guiding them and exposing them to the concepts as they go along so at the very end this is what like I said you can see there's lots of learning here that's going along and I'm going to test the chat bot and you can see that there's some trivia happening along the way who is the first Disney Princess and it's actually interactive and it's kind of moving around as they go and oh I forgot to mention moon lander is our brand new of course I'm sorry that I didn't say that earlier so thanks Zoe for clarifying that in the bottom and actually be launching on the code monkey page after today so that's gonna be really great so as you can see they're programming little components here I also found just for your own note that at the end of challenge number 16 that's why mine wasn't working as I was playing with um the components you can change it to do different questions so this one was saying who is who is Joey and Angelina German cannot say her name but anyway it's Lady gaga and so it's kind of interacting so I use this actually with my students at the end to show me some different concepts I made them do um I taught math and science so I had them do like a little science interactive thing at the end of that at the end of challenge number 16 so you can definitely do that with your students as well so those are our hour of code courses and underneath here it just talks about went what is the hour sorry let me start this part again sometimes you get so fast you forget where you are in the concepts here okay so before we go on to that page that I was just talking about I want to talk about what code monkey is and why we're a little bit different so code monkey was founded in 2014 by Jonathan Shore and he launched basically code monkey after working with students and figuring out what they really grasp concepts when it was presented in a fun in game a fight way what makes us different so I love this graphic because it puts you as a teacher in the driver's seat so the uniqueness of code monkey stems from the fact that it's real textbased coding it's not block based as you saw the students are really learning the coding concepts it's easy it's user friendly it's very intuitive and the best part is that we put you in the driver see so with all of our coding courses even the hour of code we provide you with resources to make you as just as successful as your students and when you create like a teacher trial you will actually have access to all of the same you actually have access to the course that your students have access to so you can learn to code so what makes a more fun way so before we get back to this thank you part I want to show you one more thing on our webpage itself so if you go to that address that I have listed earlier the plate code monkey com backslash our up and then of of of code the backslash it will take you here to this course here so here's where you can sign up for a free teacher trial but if you're wanting to share with like some of your stakeholders maybe your principal isn't sure why you should have an hour of code we have some information about what is the hour of code when does the hour of code take place and why is the hour of code important and then like I said moon lander will be here very soon so that was short and sweet but thank you guys so much for attending our webinar today and now we're going to open it up to some Q&A I hope that we gave you a chance to see all of our courses in action and of course you can always email our team we're happy to help you go into any more detail if you need any of that so we'll open it up to some questions for you so just before we get to all the questions and Lina you did such a great job I wanted to say that again anyone that's interested in furthering their coding in their school in the district I'm an afterschool program whatever you are doing we are here to help I'm gonna put my email in the chat bot chat box where you can send me an email if you want more information about bringing fulltime coding to your school but definitely hour of code is a great way to invigorate your students whether you're doing coding already or you're just about to start Co monkeys a great place to start and just remember have fun with the hour of code that's what it's designed for and like I said just have everything set up beforehand and you'll have a seamless exciting and we would love also I should throw this out there we would love for you to hashtag us and any of your social things that you're doing for our code we would love to share your information on our blog and with our users hope we have one question here in the Q&A box let's check this out what was the hour of code URL so let me go back to that actually oops that's a great question thank you so much for asking that so you can do it through code org slash learn and click on code monkey or you can do our web address right here WWL a code monkey comm backslash our of code backslash you all right well it looks like there is no I'll answer this someone had asked what is the code monkey hashtag and our code monkey hashtag is hashtag play code monkey and so like I said you can tag us during the hour of code and somebody asked can they go back to the game that they didn't finish an hour absolutely students can go back and finish it if the students are not more than good to trial they may have to start again but you can encourage them to kind of do that as well all right thank you everyone and looks like we have no more questions just remember we're always here for you and we thank you again for joining us at code monkeys hour of code webinar have a wonderful day everybody you
