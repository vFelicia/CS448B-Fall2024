foreign foreign hello everyone we want to welcome you to code monkey's administrative dashboard webinar our goal today is going to be to make sure that you have all the tools and information that you need to be successful and confident in managing your school or your District's Code Monkey subscription during today's webinar we invite you to ask questions we have folks who will be attending to your um the Q a so we'll be answering throughout the webinar and we will also have a q a following the presentation so um we'll get to all of the questions by the end of our event today um and so with that I'm going to go ahead and Maya if you'll change the slide yeah uh so uh I also want to thank everybody for joining us today we're really excited uh to share with you the latest and newest features uh that we added to the admin dashboard and we invite you to follow us on social media uh Code Monkey Stu chronic student to stay up to date on everything that's code monkey and for edtech news and content and you can find us on Twitter Instagram Facebook and of course the Code Monkey blog on our website um so let's meet the team uh so my name is Maya uh Maya Miller I am one of cool monkey's uh csms from the customers and success team I work with our customers schools and teachers once they join Code Monkey I handle their onboarding which means that I make sure that they set up their subscription add students and start using Code Monkey successfully um as Code Monkey is a very teacher friendly platform most of the customers are able to do those stages independently but me and Angie were there to help the ones who need help and there's always a lot to do at the beginning of the year so there's always a lot of things that we can do to help and uh and I mostly uh use the great videos and help center that we have uh for example one of the videos is getting started with Code Monkey a video a video tutorial that helps teachers uh to hit the ground running when they set up their subscription and um Angie why don't you introduce yourself absolutely so my name is Angie lintner I'm also a customer success manager here at Code Monkey I have worked within customer success in the edtech industry for almost eight years now I really love what I do like Maya I also support customers in onboarding setup setting goals for their use of Code Monkey and helping them to monitor progress towards those goals using data and metrics most importantly I feel my focus is to help all of your teachers and students be successful uh whatever success looks like for them that's awesome um so let's uh go over uh some of the topics that we plan to cover today and so we are going to talk about what is Code Monkey uh and a little bit about code monkey's Pathway to learning and this is what Angie's gonna talk about a little bit and we're gonna review the admin dashboard as it currently is and the new features that we are launching next during next week and we will be talking about monitoring students uh progress usage and tracking that and of course in the end we'll have a q a session so I know part of the webinar today is going to be a little bit technical uh so first of all we have a moderator here who is able to answer your answers in the Q a box and during the Q a uh time we will answer whatever questions that weren't answered in the Q a box and any new question that has arisen during the webinar so feel free um so what is Code Monkey Code Monkey is a leading coding for kids program that provides engaging online courses for students to learn code it's made with schools and teachers in mind standards are aligned with csda and EC and k through eight and it's a complete case rate coding curriculum and start starting from um block based moving on to textbased coding and then finally even python real python uh so no prior coding is experience is needed in order to teach as I mentioned it's made with schools and teachers in mind we know that teachers don't necessarily or even usually don't have coding background uh which means that we have a very extensive help center and teacher resources that are made to help teachers just be able to focus in helping the students in the classroom wonderful and to springboard off that as far as what Maya is explaining with the resources uh I want to share a little bit about the Code Monkey Pathway to learning typically this is a tool that we offer to teachers and what it is designed to do is help guide teachers into where to start students properly at a good level for their student and grade band and we like to share this with administrators because we know that you're not always familiar with all of the various resources available and If you get questions we would love for you to have a general understanding of what is available to your teachers and students within the platform so starting on the left with block based coding we offer Code Monkey Junior and beaver achiever these courses are going to be suited for your K through 2 classrooms moving on to your textbased coding dodo does math and coding Adventure includes that type of coding language and that would be ideal for your three through five students and then wrapping up on the higher end you have your sixth through ninth grades that will learn as Maya mentioned Python and that can be found in our game builder banana tales and coding chat bots so this is a nice visual that your teachers can use to identify where would be a good place to to get their students started that's excellent and I just want to add something that a teacher just recently told me that one of the things that they love about Code Monkey except for the students obviously loving it and enjoying the learning experience is that within the Code Monkey platform because we have such a vast coding curriculum uh students what the teacher said was students become from student to Creator we have Creator we have a Creator spaces in Code Monkey so students can actually use code to create a chat bot and whatnot so that's pretty awesome and I really like the become from student to creator um so Angie yes I'm gonna go ahead and move on over to the live demo portion of our presentation um Maya you're seeing the interview yes all right wonderful so for those of you who are in The Code Monkey platform um frequently you notice um you know things look relatively the same at the moment things will be changing shortly within the week and Maya will go into what those changes will look like but currently what you have on your administrative dashboard when you log in are going to be your widgets giving you general information about the subscription and who has access to it so you'll get a synopsis of how many teachers schools classrooms and students are accessing the platform or have access and then underneath that you have your subscription details and those include the name of your subscription how many seats were purchased and used as well as when the subscription becomes active and when it expires moving on to your teachers tab our admin dashboard is relatively new it was launched last year so some of you may not be familiar with this when you're managing multiple teachers we've added this to make it easier for you to give teachers access and this is one of the few things as an administrator you will need to do at the beginning of every subscription and that is to give your teachers access by adding them as a teacher on the subscription this is super simple from the teachers tab you will simply enter their email address and click on invite once you've done that you'll see that they'll be added to your table and you'll get a status as for example this particular teacher is pending they'll they'll be receiving an email that will allow them to access the platform and then they will become an active teacher teachers can be added by you as a primary teacher or they can be added by another teacher to a classroom to be a coteacher and they would be labeled as such in the table moving on to your schools tab this is not a Mandatory Action however it as an administrator is highly likely to be helpful to you this is where you will create your schools and get information about those schools in terms of how many registered users are within that school how many classrooms and how many students again super easy you just navigate to the top right hand corner you'll type in the name of the school the way you'd like to see it appear on the table and then you'll click add School if you ever want to edit your school names you can simply click on the pencil icon that will open up the field so that you can make appropriate edits and then you would save your changes you also have the ability to remove a school from your classroom table and you would do that by clicking on the garbage can icon moving over to your classrooms table first and foremost I want to differentiate for you some of you may be the administrator of your school or District's account as a whole but you may also be using Code Monkey in the classroom with your students as a teacher so when you're an administrator your classrooms tab will include all classrooms that are assigned to this subscription or that roll up to the subscription whereas your my classrooms tab on the left hand side is only the classrooms that you are the primary teacher for so know that that is the difference between those two areas again as you have created classrooms you will um see that they are listed here on the classrooms table you get general information about the school the primary teacher number of students you have an option here to Archive classrooms that will remove them from your classroom table and again you have an option to edit and when you click into that you'll notice that you can change the classroom name you can change the school in order for this drop down to be active you do need to create the schools under the schools tab and then you can change the primary teacher or the coteacher for that classroom and again the teacher in question must be registered on the teachers tab for them to show up in your drop down menu then you would click save and your changes will be saved to the platform in addition to the classroom table if you have a long list of classrooms we offer you a filter option so that you can filter by teacher classroom or school to shorten that list up and be able to view just the classrooms that you are needing to work with from the classrooms tab you were also able to upload classrooms on behalf of your teachers so teachers definitely have the ability to manually create their own classrooms however if you would like to lessen the burden for them you can do that here when you click on upload classrooms you will be given short and very explicit instructions on how to build the file it's super easy with four columns simply naming the classroom entering the primary teacher's email address chilling in the school and then if a coteacher will be involved then adding their email address as well once this is saved in a CSV file format you can select that file and upload and that will Mass create all of the classrooms in one one thousand Loop now there is not a way currently to roster students within that same file but your teachers do have a bulk upload option when they go to add students so that is available to them finally we have the Kebab menu That's to the right of the upload classrooms button if you are in the platform or have been recently you'll notice we have a couple of new editions we have had our usage report available for some time we now offer an activity report which is a student activity report and we'll take a look at that in more depth in a moment you also have your export course progress report which will also take a look at and is also a new report available to you in addition to these options you can search by student or you can access the archived classroom section I'm going to return to the reports in just a moment um but let's review our assignments tab which is the last piece of your administrative dashboard here if you would like you are able to manage assignments for all classrooms on the subscription some schools and districts prefer that the teacher manage the assignments others preferred at the administrator manage those either way you can do that from one place you have an option here to assign all courses currently you can see all of the courses are assigned to all of my classrooms I can also unassign all of the courses from all classrooms and that's refresh and then you can see that then all classrooms have been have no courses assigned and this is where you'd want everything set if you don't want students working within the platform quite yet if you're introducing or providing background knowledge to them this is a way to keep them from working within the platform you also have the flexibility of differentiating what courses you assign to each classroom you can simply click on the individual courses that you would like each classroom to have access to and of course those can be different and you can also limit progress so if you would like students to only be able to work through a certain Challenge in a course you would assign that course click on the carrot select set progress limit and then simply enter the number of the challenge that their students can work through once they hit this number and they complete that challenge they will be locked out of the remainder of the course until you either increase this number or come back and return them to free play so with that I'm going to come back to our my classrooms tab and we will move into the reporting portion of the presentation and we'll take a look at the reports that are available to you and then Maya is going to show you the very exciting new features and reports that will be coming shortly so first and foremost you have your general usage report so when you access this report you will be asked to outline or identify a timeline that you want to see data for when you click into this field you simply click on the two dates the beginning date and the end date for the data that you would like to see and here is the report that you will get um once it's downloaded and there's a lot of information on this usage report starting with your students usage so you'll get an overview of classrooms the number of registered users the number of sessions the users have completed within the time frame that you outlined the number or average session duration in minutes and the number of challenges or exercises the students have solved in that time frame below that you get a graphical representation of your active users by month so you can see when your Peak usage is as well as when it starts tapering off moving down you'll then get teacher usage information again the number of registered teachers and the number of sessions that they have engaged in followed by a little bit more granular data at the classroom level here you're given the classroom name the number of students in that classroom and then you're given the number of active users in that classroom month over month and the final column provides you with a total number of challenges solved by the students in that classroom so this provides you a nice way of being able to identify what classrooms are more active and maybe which classrooms such as this one may need a little bit more encouragement or support in getting students engaged with Code Monkey returning to the Kebab menu we now also have an activity report available when you click into this you're really just going to be given one option this report will be for the entire subscription from the date it was activated through the date that you're running it and really what they're what we're asking you here is do you want all activity even if the classrooms are now archived so if you would like to see all activity from the day that your subscription started then you're going to want to include any archived classrooms to make sure that usage is captured if you just want to see usage for the classrooms that are active then you would leave that uncheck marked and then select export reports when you export the report this is what it will look like or it will look similar to this I've wiped a lot of the data from this in terms of personal information for the students but yours of course would be populated so the report will start by giving you the classroom name whether it's active or archived you'll also get the students first and last name their login type how many times they've logged in as well as their username we also provide you with the date and time they first logged into their account as well as a date and time for the last time that they logged into their account and then we provide you some metrics and really what we're looking at here is your student engagement total time on the site in minutes the number of times they've been on the site in the past month which of course depending on when you introduce coding will you'll have Peaks and valleys a number of sessions in the past month that they have engaged with and then the total number of solutions submitted by the student during the subscription and what's great about this report is that it is granular at the student level so you can really see what engagement you're getting not only at a classroom level but really digging down further into the student level returning to our Kebab menu we now have the export course progress report foreign here you'll be given a drop down menu this report is run by course and it will provide you progress on all students who have completed challenges within that course during the time frame that or for the subscription in this case I'm going to go ahead and select sequencing in Loops again you need to determine whether you want archived classrooms included in this report or not and then you would click on exports when your report is done you'll be able to download it and it will look something like this similar to what we looked at with the activity report but giving you different data points so again you'll have the same information classroom name whether that classroom is active or archived the student's name and username for logging in and then information on how many challenges the student has completed within this course the total number of stars that they've earned as they've worked through the course and here's where we get into really the meat of this report so I'm going to move over just a little your average score column is again going to of course give you an average for each challenge that the students have completed give you kind of an aggregate average for for the overall course and as you're looking at this it's important to remember that A3 under any challenge is a perfect score so as you look at average scores for your students the closer they are to a three the better they are grasping the concepts they are being exposed to because a perfect score is going to be three and then you can also see the progress as you scroll to the right challenge by challenge you can see what that student score as they worked through the course and you're easily able to see that students that move quickly from one challenge to the next and out and are scoring that perfect score they are making progress this is how you can determine the student is actually progressing and is understanding and comprehending the concepts that they are being taught you are also given an average for the classroom and at the end of the report an average for the entire subscription I um talk with a lot of customers districts schools administrators and I can say that one thing that I hear very commonly this school year is that Code Monkey is being used specifically for exposing students to computer science or coding Concepts so this is a report that you can use to show that as well because if your student here is your concept sequencing your first 15 challenges in this course are related to sequencing here's your loops and all of the reports will have the concepts listed at the top so as you put those Concepts in conjunction with how the students scored you can easily show with metrics that your students are being exposed to those Concepts and are grasping them successfully so with that that concludes the demonstration portion of our event today so I'm going to hand it back to Maya who is going to pick up and show us what is coming in the very near future for Code Monkey wow Angie you are so thorough and so organized You Gotta Give me some tips after the webinar is finished I Wanna Be You amazing thank you for covering all of this uh and everyone again I want to remind you that we know that this is kind of a technical webinar so first of all q a session will be uh we'll have some time for that in the end you also can always reach out to us uh for um through the support email and you will see you will get the address uh email address at the end and this webinar will also be live on our YouTube and our webinar section at the website within a week or so maybe less uh so you can rewatch that whenever you want um so thank you Angie and I'm I know that the webinar is supposed to end at 6 15 in 15 minutes we may uh go overboard a little bit uh just to have more time for Q a uh so let's Jump Right In um so this is a a mockup image of what uh the the of the expanded admin dashboard what it's going to look like but before I jump into that I just wanted to say um that this admin dashboard is a result of a lot of feedback that we've been getting from administrators uh curriculum coordinators teachers and it's it's not the first time that we have built something in accordance uh of feedback that we received from teachers for example in the past uh we had a few teachers saying that they needed more assessment tools so we created the quizzes tab that you can find for in in every classroom's dashboard uh code Nike Junior the course for example initially had 30 challenges but we heard from teachers that the kiddos are loving it and they need more courses and more content so we upgraded it to 60 challenges and then again to 120 challenges so all of that is a result from feedback that we're getting from you uh you literally have the power to affect the product that you're that you're receiving that you're using that you're using daily that you're purchasing and working with so why am I saying that uh just that if we see that this new feature is being used and we get feedback on your needs uh maybe it doesn't cover all your needs maybe you have more uh specific particular granular things that you need from your admin dashboard well if anything is still being unfulfilled or with betters or some small tweaks would better suit your modus operandi so we will make changes and you will have an in an imprint on how the product and what the product looks like so please whenever you have feedback don't be shy tell us um okay back to the admin dashboard so the new and extended admin dashboard is not live yet it will be so uh in within the next week and but we do have some mockups that we'll be sharing with you today and uh it will be um and and once it is live you will all be able to dive deeper and explore on your own but you will have the knowledge that you acquired today so it's not you won't be starting from scratch uh so and again it gets a little bit technical but will will answer a question in the end so the admin dashboard here um our hypothesis was that District that means during the year during the school year I want to Monitor and track usage and progress of uh of their classrooms so at key points during the year and we know that admins are looking uh to know what is being used and what isn't where do we need to invest more time and effort and where are the success stories so our goal here is to give the admins uh sort of an impression or status of both General activity meaning usage and progress in courses um for that purpose the admin dashboard will display data relating to and pulled from the managed subscription and the main subscription classrooms uh the data that it will be displayed here gets uh updated every 24 hours which means every day you'll get you'll see changes you'll see movement and and it's displayed from the start of the subscription till the current day and and the charts which I will show you up close uh later would can display by weekly or monthly and the data and as long as uh for the term perspective um so the data sorry did you want to say something no all right so the data taken from all classrooms uh is in the subscription for all customers in the subscription of course is excluding archives classrooms by default so if you remember Angie showed you the reports before you can select whether you want archived classrooms to be included in the report or not here it's automatically excluded and the course yeah so the courses list displayed should be uh it's all Code Monkey courses and you can see here that we uh okay that again this is a mockup uh usually it wouldn't be zero schools because as Angie said uh the admins are the ones who really can benefit from adding schools and to the to the mix and to the helps divide the classrooms so the uh yeah so this is an overview of the subscription the number of schools the amount of classrooms how many students there are and how many teachers and you so you can see that from 822 students and 97 are engaged what does engaged mean engage means that they had over two sessions why we chose over two sessions because we assume usually the first session is the first sign up and then the second session is really activation and getting more uh HandsOn with playing and learning with the platform same goes for teachers uh in engaged teacher is a teacher that logged in more than once um on the student usage part of the overview you'll see that there's active students total onsite minutes and time spent on site break breakdown so all of those oh yeah so I had this yeah engaged you can see that wherever there's a tooltip there will be an explanation on what how we Define uh what is the bar how we Define this criteria so even if you forgot it's always right there at hand um so active students I think is pretty straightforward we just talked about it active students and students and that have signed in you can view it as weekly or monthly total onsite minutes will be the number of minutes spent by each student so this would be the average and time on site breakdown you can see here that it's between zero to nine minutes 10 to 29 30 to 59 and 60 minutes and above and you'll see the colors change throughout the year and for example we know that for a lot of subscriptions the median and time per session for a student would be around 12 minutes and because class is 45 minutes there is usually you know five minutes just getting students to concentrate and about 20 minutes of tutoring learning the theoretical part and then the Practical part of playing is usually about 15 minutes out of the class so you would see at the beginning of the year most of this will be green and then depending on what the frequency of classes is is a daily weekly uh I don't know whatever you choose uh so there's no right way to teach with Code Monkey we know that sometimes it's more of a structural lesson as I described uh just now but sometimes it's just free play and then and they let the kids just Play and Learn uh independently and then you would probably see the numbers change accordingly so I'm only uh delving into this just to make sure that if you see zero to nine just don't be worried it just means probably one class was done and so time spent uh oh yeah and this will be time spent by active students so this will only take um take the data from students that have activated their accounts uh total onsite minutes will be all time spent by all students and active students would be active students that had at least one session during the week or month so just to differentiate active students at least one session engage students at least two again weekly monthly you can filter it in any way that you want um so uh the last part would be student progress and again even I think even the wording here may change a little bit before this is launched you're really getting a sneak peek preview of something that we haven't launched yet so uh here on the student progress we can see amount of solutions submitted and you can choose so here is the tooltip says weekly last 12 weeks and you can click the drop down menu and select which course you want um to view or view all courses and it presents successful Solutions submitted by students in the subscription and again uh linking to what Angie said about the scoring system it can be between one to three stars so any solution between one to three stars will be presented here if students attempted uh to tempted a challenge but weren't able to complete it then it won't appear here it's not a solution submitted if they didn't complete the challenge and so this and again uh following on what Angie mentioned this can be a great way to show progress uh if you ever need to if ever uh you need your teachers to present uh progress to you or you need to present progress to somebody else or just want to monitor it um a great way to show progress can be screenshotting this once a month and I know screenshotting is not ideal we do plan on adding an ability to print or download it at a later stage but for now with this initial version a screenshot can be a way to go or again from the classrooms tab on your admin dashboard you can generate a usage report or an activity report and get all of that information there and before we finish I just want to say uh so in four days hour of code week begins hour of code week is uh as you must know the biggest week for all uh coding curriculums and we get a um we get a lot of activity during that time we know teachers really love using our courses in the classroom during hour of code and we have um specific courses that are designated per hour of course with for our code and hour of code lesson plans so even there we are aware that teachers need resources to be able to teach so I just wanted to share with you uh this is those are the steps so you the teachers or the students or whoever can choose a course that best suits their classroom or themselves review the course teacher notes prior to class and then make sure and that everybody has access to computer or laptop internet and code away um we have two more really cool things to let you know uh so four uh uniquely especially four hours of code we now have uh students and kids have an ability to generate and download uh certificates for themselves so if before uh a teacher would be would be the only one with access to download a certificate once the student completed the course now students and kids can do so themselves we have a health article on that uh on our help center which I by the way really recommend check out our help center very useful and we keep it up to date but to summarize once a student completed the course the thumbnail of the course will earn the V sign and become clickable and when they click it they can download they they there's a popup window and by clicking the download certificate button the certificate will be downloaded uh only note is when a child or student downloads their own certificate it will not include their teacher's name on it so as opposed to the certificates generated from the teacher's gradebook uh and uh in six days from now we have another free live webinar with Jonathan Shore one of our two amazing cofounders that started code monkey and it will be a live webinar and they'll be talking about the history of Code Monkey how everything started uh and where we are today it will be on Wednesday December 7th at 11 A.M EST um stay tuned you'll be getting an invite to this to sign up to this webinar uh by email and Q a we are ready to hear from you let's see if we have any questions pending questions okay well I know um it can take a minute or two to think of a question so uh we'll wait for a minute let you guys absorb everything that you learned here today and if you have any q and A's please write them in the Q a box
