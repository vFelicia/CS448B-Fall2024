all righty welcome everyone to the hour of code our 2019 hour of code with code monkey we thank you for joining us I know we have some people from kind of all over Mountain Time and East Coaster hi Michael how's it going and some of our other attendees so we're gonna go ahead and kind of get started and we're gonna start off with introducing the team so I always like to start off with knowing who we are just so if you guys have any questions or kind of want to know anything my name is Lena Saleh and I'm the professional development manager here at code monkey I have a former teacher I taught in the classroom for just about around 10 years and spent some time in my even when I was in high school going into the classroom and kind of learning from there I've been with code monkey for about two years now helps leaving the professional development you can reach me here via email or you can reach out to me on Twitter at Lena at code my everyone as you can see there my name is Mark Dozier I am the art of the customer success as part of their customer success team ecwid lucky I've been in that role for about past four months it's an awesome team basically my role here is to help you any questions throughout the school year whether it's based on the platform or the setup or anything in that room prior to joining code lucky I was also a teacher myself for about 16 years and I do remember this hour of code week being the most exciting time I said if you're new to this I would add your kids are gonna love it and for those of you that have done this before just remember you could always use this as a way to sort of we Kendall that fire when it comes to coding so thanks Lena thanks mark hi everyone I'm Brett s Wilson I'm the VP of Sales here at code monkey and so my main role is to help schools and teachers learn about code monkey find out how they can implement it in their classrooms to help students ultimately just make the teachers lives easier with one less thing on their plate by utilizing code monkey and so I've been in EdTech for quite a while working with several different companies and ultimately I'm very passionate about bringing technology to the classroom to make things easier on teachers and then allow students better ways to learn thanks everybody I'm J Bloodworth I'm the curriculum developer here at code monkey like most people I have a background in teaching I taught math for 20 years although my degrees actually computer science and so now I'm writing computer science curriculum here at code monkey so I'm mostly behind the scenes but you know I'm a poke my head in some these webinars now and then to contribute what I can I want to really echo what Mark said when I was at the classroom power of code and computer science education week was my favorite time of the year so I think your students enjoy it let them enjoy it and enjoy it yourself it's a good time awesome well that's our team so we want to just thank you again for joining us for our 2019 hour of code webinar we know that there are is a vast majority of choices that you have for hour of code week and I share the sentiment with the rest of our team that that was always my favorite time and I even started doing our code week back in 2012 even before it was officially the code org adoption of our of code but if you have any questions during today's session please send them in the Q&A or in the chat box along the side also please tweet at us using hashtag code monkey you'll see it along the bottom of everything and then always remember to write code catch bananas and save the world and I will tell you that after today's webinar there will be a survey that will pop up at the end and it will be your professional development certificate for today so thank you so you can see you can follow us here on twitter facebook instagram and/or follow us along on our blog so today's web our objectives are to discuss code monkeys story what is the hour of code where to find us some of the courses that we offer and then setting up for the hour of code the requirements and kind of going through all of that kind of stuff and then exploring courses and then we always leave time for you at the end for QA there is nothing more powerful than your questions so if you have any during this time please ask it and we'll do our best to answer you so we always like to start off talking about what code monkey is and kind of the story behind code monkey oops excuse me so code monkey was founded in 2014 there's actually a tea there are two brothers and their best friend they founded code monkey after they went in and they were volunteering their time working with students and found that students just really didn't love learning the traditional coding I mean so when they started to animate it and bring code monkey and that's they found that students just love the coding concepts much more when it was gamified and fun and who doesn't love our monkey so that's kind of how code monkey was born so today code monkey is a very fun and engaging and we program in a few different languages now and our company has been growing so we're happy to have you alongside us so what really makes code monkey different than other programs or platforms kind of that you use code monkey is a is intuitive it's very gamified even from the very beginning it's a very user friendly and really we're designed to put you the teacher and the driver seats are really giving you the tools that you need to really become successful when teaching with code monkey and it's also very easy to roll out right so what is the hour of code obviously you hour of codes been around for quite some time and it's just growing every single year and the course availability options are just growing but hour of code is really not designed to be a computer science course it's not designed to teach the students at full fundamentals they're not coming in the hour of code week and walking out being developers ready for Google it's really just designed to give students the opportunity to get basically a taste of what computer science it's kind of like the first time you try ice cream it's so delicious you can't stop and you keep going back for more and so that's really what does that live code monkey I mean what the hour of code week is really for Bob obviously you know that the landscape of the job market scene for students is vastly changing it's very different from when I was a kid when really we only knew about you know a few different opportunities and we know that the jobs half the jobs that our students have will have access to aren't even invented yet but there are about 500,000 openings throughout the country for computer jobs I live here in Austin and the texting every single day you see is growing more companies are bringing their companies actually to the city landscape and that means there's more jobs for students and more opportunity for them so it's just a and I believe it's a very timeless skill set so we offer many different courses for hour of code week our newest one is code monkey jr. it is a peso just kind of keep that in mind we have our coding adventure our dota does math course game builder and our brandnew banana Tales Python course our trivia choppa which is also Python and then our moon lander course so I'm gonna talk a little bit about kind of where those are and kind of what they are but first let's discuss how do we even find these hour of code courses for hour of code you don't need a student login you don't have to have a subscription it's just really a place for you to try out code monkey with your students so how do you even get there you can find us on the co.org web page and I don't know if you guys know this or not the code org used to be used to be code org slash learn and now there is actually an hour of code page so I'll kind of show you where that is here in just a moment but when you get there to the course you select the activities and you just select the created by code monkey studios and then there is a beginner and a comfortable and that's with all the course options that are available not only that but we do have a specific page for code monkey to find us so you can go to code monkey comm slash hour of code and that's how you get there but let me just show you a little bit how you get there so here I am on the hour of code page you can see us as hour of code comm which is great you click on activities and then you can select the creative by section and so when you select created by we click on code monkey studios we can see our courses that are available like I said code monkey junior is great the pre readers love it but it is an app it is an app so just kind of keeping that in mind and then our banana tails is beginner I suggest it mostly for the later grades but why not have them try it during this time and then coding adventure and then like I said in the comfortable section are our other courses it's either that or you can go to the code monkey hour of code course page and you'll see the different courses here as well as suggested ages so just something to kind of keep in mind so how do the courses work and where should I use them with my students well code monkey jr. is really designed for that prek early reader up to like first grade age the doted as math courses kind of works through the distances angle measurement and multiplication so that's really meant for a second through fifth graders as well as the coding adventure course both doted as math and coding adventure on a language called CoffeeScript and CoffeeScript is a real recognized language but it is a shorter version of JavaScript and Python without all the heavy syntax our banana tales course says second through eighth grade here I would suggest using it with like a little bit of the older grades unless you feel like they're super confident in the Python but why not try it and then the game builder course where they work through the game game mechanics working through a Super Mario style game and then our trivia chat pod is full Python working through a game basically it's a game of hangman which we don't call it hangman anymore we call it snowman so it's building that trivia game out and then a moon lander is a physics based course it's really great even for like the high schoolers the monkey has to you learn how to land a moon lander on the launching pad working with thrust and really interworking the very a lot of science ii topics throughout there so before we get into the courses what should i prepare for the hour of code so I think of myself always thinking like I'm always very prepared for the situation I think about I'm just working one to one of my students are super calm but actually what happens during the hour of code week as you know oftentimes the websites crash or you know I may not have everything prepped the way that I thought I would have everything prepped and I often feel like I'm fighting off dinosaurs like you like you are here like this picture here on the bottom so it's really great and highly suggested an island that's a hard way myself the first year when I watch it with 500 kids and I thought oh this is just gonna work seamlessly the website went down like all kinds of things happen so it's always good to make sure that you're testing out the specs before you are launching it you just really want a seamless transition you also want the kids have as much possible coding to really get that excitement so just something to kind of keep in mind with all of our hour of code courses we do have teacher notes so when you select a course any of our courses here we do have the teacher notes and when you go to the teacher notes you just kind of scroll down here at the bottom you can access the notes just keep in mind all of our courses are also standards aligned to CS ta and several other several other alignment so you can check that out too if that's something that's necessary for you within the teacher notes are the specs so it tells you the suggested ages if it's web base if you need to install anything all the courses except for code monkey junior do not need to do like any kind of installation or anything like that highly suggest to do headphones because there's some fun sounds and things like that and then just always making sure that it does work with your most updated version of your web browser so that's always an important thing I know that sometimes seems like it's easy to do it and then it will tell you kind of a little bit about it like how how long it is how many levels what kinds of things what can you kind of expect the prep there's also student certificates so I suggest printing these out because the hour of code is a really great way to tie in all your parent volunteers stakeholders the more the merrier to kind of help you have all hands on deck and this is really the best way to really integrate that community in with your classroom okay so now that we have kind of explored that part of it I know that it's always like a little bit fast and serious does anyone have any now's the time to ask any questions if you have anything about like tag get set up or the our code or anything like that okay great if not feel free to ask my team they're here for your help okay and the code monkey certificates are really great for student portfolios and all that kind of thing as well so I always suggest printing those out also parents love certificates right as much as the kids do so why not award them for all the hard work that they've done okay so we're gonna talk about a few of the courses not all of the courses we don't have time to explore every single course but I suggest that you kind of check them out but we're gonna go over some of them so our coding adventure course like I said for the hour of code you don't need to do anything logging in you can create a teacher trial it's 30 days 30 students you have the ability to track all the students progress and see all the lesson plans and all the stuff that kind of goes with that I kind of make it a little bit longer for your students but you can just click right here on the start playing code monkey starts out with a trailer basically gorilla comes and steals his bananas and he gets sad and then he gets mad and he's ready to go how code monkey is set up let me turn down the sound I never know if you guys can hear the sound but just turn off the sound for the sake of this so just some kind of things to note this the text editor is on the right the stage is on the left the monkey is here and these buttons type out for the students it's not a draganddrop it just is really easy for them to not get so tied down with spelling or anything like that and then we can pick up the ruler and kind of measure the distance so I'm gonna pull up the story map here so the students work linearly through the coding concepts so if if for some reason I was doing an hour code in a school and something happened with their their internet if a student gets exited out of this just know that they do have to start from the beginning when playing the hour of code version this happens with a lot of websites that we we are not saving their progress except well for while they're in it so basically we go through and we click run here and it will oh shoot so sorry I just realized that my screen was frozen so let me retrain what I was talking about so so sorry guys sometimes you forget you know okay so what I was saying here is that you is that when you click on the course here you can just start logging in and playing right here from the very beginning so here we are in the code monkey platform and the there's a quick trailer that will kind of show which is what I discuss which sorry that I miss that was stuck on the other screen sometimes happens but what you can see here is that we have the ruler we can pick up the ruler these buttons type out for students like I said before so I'm just gonna run this one it's very scaffolded at the beginning and just really kind of like a clickbait like really getting them excited and excited about what they can experience here so it's really designed to start off easier so that it can present more challenge kind of as they go through and they're getting more confidence as they're going through so here we see there's some tips and tricks kind of along the bottom Gordo is our teacher assistant oh sorry excuse me so he pops up with any directions he's always hanging out here there is a narration feature and there's also different languages if you need to have that as well that you can kind of change that but let's say that I type this out here and I'm maybe learning math I'm not really great at knowing that I just need to do that a lot of kids will just be like oh I see it's 15 this is already here it must need to be here so what we'll see here is we are also there's also a rating system so three stars the shortest most concise answer a two star it means that I took an extra step and a one star I like to say is there on the struggle bus and they were able to get the banana but probably didn't master the concept at hand um so it always gives them a little bit of suggestion Gordo as pops up with those tips and tricks to make their lives a little bit easier and then the student mode so now I'm gonna go to the next challenge and we'll see that it starts to kind of build in complexity as it goes introducing new tools and things like that so that's coding adventure and they move through the story map and each world is a different story so that's just for you guys to know too okay so the next course that we're going to look at is going to be our banana tails course and so banana tails is our newest course the goal is to help this baby monkey eat his bananas you can't really catch bananas himself so he has to do that that way so the very first thing that we're introduced here is there's also a trailer it's super cute I suggest watching it for the interest of time we won't and then it says oh no the twins are separated and then we need to help feed the baby monkey so we need to build a path so first it just introduces them what I love most about this specifically is it really does look like a real true programmer we have different tabs and we have a console and hints down here and the ability to mute and unmute the sound and then it also has a graph here where you can see the single squares because all programming runs also on a x and y coordinate something to know about computer programming itself as zero zeros up in the upper lefthand corner so that's just something also note for your students but I love that you can see the grid here on this one it's just introducing them that they can click on this and kind of what happens next baby's hungry now he gets fed by the remotecontrol car so this is also scored in the same similar manner that coding adventure is scored in which you have the three star to start and one star solutions and then now we're introduced to more of the Python concepts as we kind of go so we can run this see what happens as we go through and when we click on so you saw that I said that giraffe dot height and when that happened the giraffes head pops up and he becomes the bridge because otherwise the banana cannot get to the monkey in the way that we would like it to and then it proceeds and scaffolds in the same way this one is also in a story map similar to coin adventure where they work through in the linear way where they can't skip around something else I like to note here is there are reference cards located here which are really nice to look at the students have a question or they can't remember what the concept is it is right here and there's also the teacher notes for every single course like I mentioned before okay okay so the next course that we're going to discuss is the game builder this is always a very favorited course by our students like I said we can just start playing right here or access the teacher notes and making sure that we're kind of prepped for what we need dota does math is set up in the same way as coding adventure is and the moon lander is set up in the same way that this game builder course is set up as well so basically what you see over here and why we suggest it for the older grades you can tell it's a little bit it's a little bit different in that there's a lot more reading involved the kids love it but they do need to read and so that's just why I say for the suggested for the much older grades and so here we have as an upper elementary here we have the directions and kind of what we're supposed to do as we go through we click run when we click something we don't have anything program so our monkey won't actually move so we have to do something and here it tells us that we need to add a step inside of this inside the on key now when I step and I get him to the banana you'll see that the texts are running along the bottom all of our courses move through in a linear manner so the kids really are building in footing as they're going but having fun as they do it then we introduce something else here with the if key statement and now the monkey will move forward and backwards and by time he gets to the end of the game but to the end of this course he's working with chocolate and when he eats chocolate the score goes down so they work on some different like widgets and things like that throughout the course okay so like I said coding adventure and dota does math they're basically like little partners in crime we work through those different math concepts game builder and moon lander are set up in the same way and then trivia chat bot is also the same kind of screen where there's the code where there's the directions on the Left we're coding in the middle and then are programming in the middle and then on the righthand side you're either building or creating or kind of working through that on the right hand side and then banana tales set similar to coding adventure but full Python and then we have the code monkey jr. and code monkey jr. is app based there's no reading it's just symbols actually arrows to kind of get the monkey to where he needs to be to collect the bananas okay you oops okay so now that we have explored some of the courses of coding adventure we just like to kind of discuss a little bit about how if you have a teacher account you're able to basically track students progress so I do want to show you a little bit of that just so you have kind of the ability to kind of see that you just get there really quickly you and I'm also gonna answer this question Debbie this is a great question she wanted to know what is the cost for the hour of code courses and the hour of code courses do not have cost they are completely free we offer those through out the throughout actually the whole year so it's always there for you so there's never a time course is because our of code really we like to say doesn't always have to be only during the computer science week okay so here I am on the code monkey platform and I just wanted to like quickly run through things nothing there we do have like I said fully guided lesson plans for you for everything in case you needed it we also have certificates for things like that and tutorials to help you kind of get set up and all of that it's pretty easy but what's nice about the hour of code atleast signing up for a teacher trial and kind of checking out the platform is for this progress page because if you have any questions about student solutions you're not able to actually see it during the hour of code so in case this really helps like your parent volunteers be able to kind of see that so how to skip through we have a lesson mode easy ability to add students all that good kind of stuff but the progress page here is when the students have a log and created their progress there's being reported back to you so you have the ability to see exactly how it is that they're doing and then up here in green for all of our courses we have the solutions for you so you're not going and hunting any of that kind of stuff down so that's just something to note and something we like to keep in mind throughout the course or throughout the hour of code week just in case of them that way you're not you know hunting for information I know kids would ask me a question I'd be like and I don't want to be like that I really want to know that that's there for them you okay as I'm gonna say okay awesome I print training that you can also extend these activities a little bit longer so with the teacher trial you have access also to the tracking of all of the hour of code courses so you can also limit the students progress so maybe they see you for the whole week and you only want them to do ten challenges and then ten challenges the next day so then they won't be able to move to progressively or you can just open it up for them or you can do a lesson plan for them as well I do see I'm just gonna stop and take this question just now before we cut we're kind of nearing the end here but just so you know where can you get the certificates of the code monkey game is it after challenges completed or the hour of code within all of the teacher notes you can find the certificates there so there's no like guessing or checking during I mean not guessing there's no you not needing to login or anything like that it's just right there on within the hour of code notes page but great question um so we do have a fully so we went over the progress page and then we do have this lesson mode here so let's say you really wanted to extend the hour of code a little bit longer you really wanted students to be able to try the platform itself we do have a lesson mode with all of our lessons within our courses they always start out with an unplugged activity then there's playtime and then there's some time for debrief so once you begin a lesson then the students go into lesson mode and only can access the challenges within that lesson so that's just kind of something to keep in mind for you as well just switching my screens here all right so we've explored the courses and we've talked about the courses the code monkey jr. remember is for our pre readers coding adventure dota does math game builder banana tales trivia chat bot and the moon lander now we're going to leave some time for questions and for you two for some questions okay so cool I'm a michael had sent a question regarding can you see the solutions other than on the progress tab unfortunately you can only see the student solutions I mean as the students are going through you can always see their solutions as they're working on the page but unfortunately you cannot see the student solutions except for in the progress page you're able to see the answers for the solutions and the student solutions as well you can click on any of the stars within the progress tab and you'll actually be able to see exactly how they solve the inner reallife animation so that's kind of cool you this was another great question is there a limit to how many classes you can set up during the trial you get each teacher is allotted when you sign up for the teacher trial 30 students 30 days but you can access the hour of code throughout the rest of the year also if you have a co teacher you can add them to it and then you guys can both have access to that student data and information as well you are there there's a good question here are there any unplugged activities there was one there throughout the lesson plans encoding adventure there are unplugged Allah there are unplugged lessons but specifically for like our code we don't have anything like specifically unplugged for students and then Shelley a good question I found that sites like scratch in co.org are sometimes very hard to access during cs ed week due to heavy traffic and I agree I know that when I was in the teaching in the classroom that I know that that was a very hard a hard thing that kind of happened we have not experienced issues I can't say that it won't happen as there are thousands of people across the country doing the hour of code it's now worldwide it started very small but now worldwide everyone is using it during the during not the our code week the cs ed week so like I said I could not a hundred percent promise that there hasn't been anything but typically there has not been any issues with that during the week but I think you can always kind of expect it during the CSF week but I do know sites like scratch and co.org I'm very often do experience that so I think it's nice to have something external kind of there you have to think that everyone's funneling into hour of code I mean to code org for those activities so I think if you have some things bookmarked separately it makes a little bit easier you mark did you have a chance to that document I'll do that right now okay great mark is also sharing a great resource for you for hour of code week so just suggest big I caught him off guard oops that was the wrong week [Laughter] and I will oh that's not the right one mark okay we'll fix this okay so just one second we'll send that document to you this document that Marsh printout was accidental it was a my notes page so I don't think any of you guys need that my outline sometimes it happens though do you see it mark I am doing a deep dive to my email here I apologize everyone so good I found it we're ready to go okay so this is a blog created by our marketing team on some steps to have a successful hour of code so just some extra tips and tricks for you during this great fun event so to honor that and if there are no other questions today we want to just thank you for joining our webinar for the 2019 hour of code remember to follow us on twitter facebook instagram at code monkey s tu and then if there's any questions or anything that you guys have please feel free to reach out to myself or anyone on our team we're happy to help you assist for the hour of code and we hope that you have a amazing hour of code week and remember to write code catch bananas and save the world bye everybody
