VP of sales here hi everyone it's great to be here yeah Zach um been working at Code Monkey for a number of years here I started off as a teacher and uh really looking forward to this webinar and thank you all for joining I'll be here to uh answer any questions on the Q a Molly we'll talk more about that yeah um so Zach is going to be our q a champion today so if you have any questions throughout the webinar please use the Q a box through Zoom Zach will be checking that and we'll be responding to them as they come in so today's webinar is the first in a threepart series designed to give schools and districts a look at what Code Monkey is all about in our course pathway how teachers can leverage the platform and feel empowered teaching coding whether or not they have a coding background and how schools and districts can implement or expand their K8 coding curriculum so today's agenda we are going to start with an overview of Code Monkey and then at the majority of our time our short time together we will introduce our K8 coding pathway this will include our block to text based coding progression our new digital literacy courses and what students will learn so who is codemonkey Code Monkey was established in 2014 with the goal of creating developmentally appropriate and engaging curriculum for teaching students how to code online platform was designed with schools and teachers in mind the new features that are developed and released are primarily based on the feedback from our customers for checking in with them throughout the school year asking what's working what can be better and that's how we determine where we're going to make improvements or where we are going to add new things whether it's tools on the platform or new courses our coding in digital literacy courses are aligned to National standards and we are continuing to expand our standards alignment to state standards as well no prior coding experience is needed for teachers to use Code Monkey teachers aren't going to be getting slowed down with an overly technical platform classroom setup and management is easy lesson plan Solutions encoding concept guides are included with all subscriptions and our team is available as an additional resource for Technical and nontechnical questions that may arise so our K8 coding pathway Code Monkey offers offers the opportunity to teach students how to code in both block and textbased coding environments which can accommodate different learning abilities build confidence in students and minimize gaps in learning we provide a coding course progression that begins with blockbased coding before introducing students to textbased coding where they learn to code using industry recognized languages such as coffeescript and python our K through 8 coding pathway begins over here with Code Monkey Junior which is a prereader course following Code Monkey Junior block based coding which is that traditional drag and drop block coding is then introduced in Beaver achiever got a little ahead of myself here uh now then starting as early as third grade we are introducing textbased coding coffeescript which is a very beginnerfriendly language I encoding Adventure dodo does math game builder those build off of coding Adventure also using coffeescript and then our more advanced courses banana Tales encoding chat Bots introduce python also in a gamebased environment like the rest of our courses now let's check out some of these courses in more detail so again getting ahead of myself happy trigger fingers over here so we have Code Monkey Jr and beaver achiever which are the first courses in our pathway Code Monkey Jr teaches students as early as PreK the basics of coding but the progression of challenges across four different courses Code Monkey Junior eases prereaders into gaining an understanding a fundamental coding Concepts students will learn and practice these concepts by building a set of visual coding instructions to help lead a monkey to a treasure chest the four courses are aptly named after the concept students will learn which are sequencing in Loops Advanced sequencing and Loops conditional loops and procedures following Code Monkey Junior students are introduced as I mentioned to the drag and drop block based coding and beaver achiever the minimal text throughout the beaver achiever courses makes it the perfect solution for early readers and narration is also available throughout the courses through Beaver achiever students further expand their skills in sequencing and Loops conditional loops and if else conditions now talking about these courses is great looking at all of this text on a slide also great I'm sure but let's see what it looks like on the platform Code Monkey courses are consistent in how concepts are introduced and taught in the form of gamified challenges students must demonstrate their game knowledge of various coding elements in order to proceed through the story map in the game should also mention at this point if since I missed it early on but codemonkey is completely browser based all of these courses can work on Chromebooks laptops computers our block based courses copenky Junior and beaver achiever are also compatible with iPads but moving back to this so initial challenges are going to be teaching basic coding Concepts while later challenges ask students to use their creativity to form combinations of these elements in their coding Solutions so what we're looking at right here this title that says sequencing this is going to be the story map for Code Monkey Junior showing the first one through seven challenges so every challenge across all of our courses is based on a three star reading students are going to receive immediate feedback after they submit their solution and can see their progress in the course on a story map such as this students can return to any previously completed challenge for further practice or to attempt a higher rating students are not able to jump ahead and Skip challenges in order to ensure that they're learning the necessary skills so here on let's go into challenge seven so here on challenge seven and at Code Monkey Junior by clicking on the Arrow students will create a simple sequence in order to direct the monkey to pick up the banana and move to the treasure chest so here we will need to move right go up move right again and then we'll push play it's very exciting we made it to the chest and I can see that I received three stars on this challenge now that it's been completed I can go it forward to the next challenge in this course now let's look at a different challenge so what we're looking at here is a different challenge also a challenge number seven but on the course Beaver achiever we can see that students use the drag and drop functions and block based coding to create a different sequence in order for the beaver to drop logs and to build his damn his or her Dam so here we will drop to logs move right twice drop again and then we'll run through our code I knew we could do it we passed it again yep three stars on this challenge and then just by clicking the next Arrow we can move on to challenge eight or we can start this over and complete this challenge again so another course is coding Adventure coding Adventure is the first course that started it all for Code Monkey it introduces students to textbased coding students will gain an understanding of the fundamental concepts of programming as well as build skills in computational thinking and problem solving game builder is an intermediate level course that builds off of coding Adventure where students will learn fundamental game Design Concepts and using these skills students can then showcase their creativity by developing their own custom games and challenges in challenge Builder that can be shared with their peers so challenge Builder is going to be more of a Sandbox type environment where students can take the concepts that they've learned throughout coding Adventure or throughout game builder and again create their own custom challenges that they can then share textbased coding can seem intimidating to both teachers and students I understand but the course is set up to teach Concepts in incremental steps with handy tools students can use while they're working on mastering their typing and spelling skills so let's go on to this challenge back on the platform and looking at the course coding Adventure this is Challenge three so here on Challenge three the objective is to write a solution that will direct the monkey here to pick up the banana this challenge provides prewritten code so that students can manipulate the solution and practice using some of the tools including the ruler which is used for measuring so by picking up this ruler I can measure the distance between the monkey and the banana which is 12 steps it already states that here which is great so let's run through our code and oops I sent the monkey in the wrong direction so you may have noticed the platform I just clicked through it a little too quickly but platform provided a hint for me to correct my solution so here I'm going to go back and say instead of turning left let's turn right and run it again and there we go we reached three stars and we can move on to the next challenge but hints are provided throughout the courses when they're needed if students are running into areas where they might get stuck to help them out now further on in the course let's go up to challenge number 32. this is where it loops and variables are introduced so using the ruler again in challenge 32 students will correct this prewritten code that's already provided to them at the beginning of the challenge to show the correct number of steps between the monkey and the bananas so currently the variable X is saying that it's five steps but if we take this ruler measure between the monkey and the banana it's 15 Steps just double check banana between banana is another 15 Steps so I'll update the variable X to 15. and click run and there we go running around in the square picking up each of the bananas now before moving on uh beyond the ruler there are additional tools that have been built in for inclusivity so by hovering over objects I'm able to see the spelling and I can click on any of these objects and it will be typed out for me I can also find the relevant commands here at the bottom of the code editor that also by clicking on it it will type it out for me now this is great for students hints are great but what about for teachers what resources and tools are going to be available for teachers to use as they're using Code Monkey and teaching coffeescript for example to their students so along with bully guided lesson plans for each course teachers can also leverage the coding concept guides which have been created for coding adventure and banana Tales where copy script and python are introduced so all of these resources can be found on the Tshirt teacher dashboard over here on the left hand side I have teacher resources and lesson plans can be found under teaching with codemonkey and then we can go over to coding Concepts where those more detailed resources are available so this is what the coding concept guide would look like where variables are introduced so the coding concept guides provide a more detailed explanation for Concepts introduced including its definition why and when is it used it also provides examples and gifts these have been developed to be student facing so if a teacher chooses to they can provide this to their students as a further Resource as they're going through the course or they can keep it for themselves and easy with the entire class all right so that was quick preview of just some of our coding courses but for sake of time that we have let's move on in addition to our block and textbased coding pathway this past year this current year code monkey has introduced digital literacy courses which is a new segment to our course offerings each course is a semesterlong in length and covers different topics digital use being focused on the different aspects of computers and how to use them digital citizenship focuses on how students can be good citizens of the online world and be aware of their digital footprint both of these courses as is Code Monkey tradition are gamified and students work through different puzzles as they go through the courses these would be geared towards third grade and up I'm also very relevant and appropriate for middle school students as well now what comes next so you've had a preview of some of the Code Monkey courses very quick crash course to give you an idea of what code monkey can offer but we do offer teacher trial accounts the school year isn't over yet you can sign up for a free teacher trial to try out code monkey with your students with the free trial you can try out the first 30 challenges of Code Monkey Junior coding adventure and banana tales as well as all of our mini courses so although we didn't go into banana tales in depth or even checked out some of those challenges you can do so yourself by signing up for a trial and again you can use it with your students so the link to sign up for a teacher trial is here but um for a simpler URL you can go to codemaki.com in the upper right hand corner there's a sign up button and then if you're interested in learning more we ask that you write to us at sales codemonkey.com you can also go to our website again codemonkey.com and request more information through our site now also don't forget we have two more webinars uh in over the next two weeks the next one is going to be February 27th which is going to be focused on Code Monkey for teachers what resources are available what does does the teacher dashboarding classroom dashboard look like and then the third webinar is going to be May 4th which is going to be Code Monkey for district so as a district or a school what can I do to bring in Code Monkey and how can we start using it I want to thank everyone for joining us again today and we are looking forward to seeing you all again soon thank you Molly if there are any questions feel free to write on the Q a we'll wait a few minutes someone asked Molly February 27th has passed it's April 27th it is April 27th I am clearly living in the last two months a question was asked we have programs for homeschoolers we do um if you want to go to codemonkey.com home Dash plans you can find subscriptions available there for homeschools or individual learners foreign well again thank you everyone for joining us today um Molly there's a few more questions all right let's see one is I am from Gabriella I'm a robotics teacher would I be able to have all K5 students access this platform absolutely uh with our subscriptions we include all courses as well so you'd have the flexibility in assigning one or multiple courses based on where your students are at and what you want to use for your your robotics program another question about discounts for Title 1 schools if you want to reach out to us at sales codemaki.com happy to go over uh pricing options for for your specific school well I would just add to that that if you go to our Code Monkey grants page which we launched last year you can see all the different wording we have for grants that you'd like to apply to we've already created language that will enable you to easily take that language and put it into your Grant application um for for all different types of grants available all right see you all later thank you very much Molly see you all next Thursday
