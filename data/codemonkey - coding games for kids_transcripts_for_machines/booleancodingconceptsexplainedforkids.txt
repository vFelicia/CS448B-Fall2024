welcome to boolean opera let's learn about booleans boolean is true or false and is a boolean operator that combines two booleans it evaluates too true only when these two booleans are true so here we have an example of an if statement so if banana frozen and banana green because we're using a and an and boolean operator it means that both the banana must be frozen this must be true and the banana must be green this must be true both must be true in order for the indented code to run let's look at it a little bit more so here we have a table that explains all the different possibilities and what the condition would result in so here we have if banana frozen and banana green now sometimes the banana will be frozen so we'll have a true and when we it's not frozen it'll be false sometimes the banana will be green true but sometimes it won't be green that'll be false because we're using the boolean operator the boolean and operator only when both are true will this condition be true let's look at a challenge here's a challenge where the monkey wants to get those bananas but both the bear and the tiger are watching so the monkey wants to make sure they're both sleeping before getting the bananas so if we look at the code it says fix this condition until bear sleeping yeah we want that to be true but we also want the tiger to be sleeping we want both to be true so we're going to use the and not there so we're going to use the and tiger sleeping both being true and so this condition will only be true when both are true otherwise we'll just wait and once they're both true we'll move over to the for loop and get those bananas all right go sleeping now or is another boolean operator that combines two booleans it evaluates to true when at least one of these booleans is true so for example if banana frozen or banana green because we're using the or boolean operator only one of these needs to be true for the indented code to run here's our table again but this time we have it with the or boolean operator if banana frozen or banana green and you could see we have several true outcomes several true conditions for banana frozen or banana green when both are true but also when only one is true we still get a true condition let's look at a challenge here's a challenge where we want the goat to go to the banana however the bear is watching so we have to wait until the bear is distracted either by sleeping or by playing so if we look at the code it says fix the conditions we'll change this to until the bear is sleeping or the bears playing okay so only one of these needs to be true in order for us to go and get the have the goat get the banana okay but if you neither are true we're just gonna wait okay let's go ahead and run it okay waiting okay beer is playing now it's your turn to use booleans good luck you
