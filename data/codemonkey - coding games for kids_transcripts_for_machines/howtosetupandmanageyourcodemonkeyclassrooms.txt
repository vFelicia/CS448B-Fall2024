all righty so just to be able to honor everyone's time we are going to get started right away at two o'clock on the dot so 2 2 p.m eastern sorry 2 p.m central standard time um so if you um that's it we're going to get started alrighty so hello everybody welcome to code monkey's first webinar for the back to school season on how to set up and manage your classrooms the code monkey team wants to personally thank you for joining us for today's webinar we know that time seems like it has been turned upside down so our goal for today is to make sure that you are getting exactly what you need out of today's webinar to help prepare you to teach code monkey with your students oops so be sure to follow us on twitter instagram at codemonkeystu during today's webinar and also tweet at us using the hashtag codemonkeywebinar we'll do our best to answer any live tweets during our webinar today and my team is also here to answer any questions that you may have and you'll meet them in just a few moments so please chat with us along the side if you have any questions or ask them in the q a box we if we do not answer your questions immediately during the session of today's webinar we will try to get them get to them today during our q a and if we don't get to them during the q a we'll be sure to follow up with you after today's webinar following today's webinar a survey will pop up and once you take the survey a professional development certificate will be emailed to you directly following if you don't receive that you can email us and we'll follow up with you as well so let's get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world before we introduce ourselves i do want to go ahead and just take a poll for you for today i just kind of want to just learn a little bit about who you are so i'm just going to give everyone just a few moments to take this poll and then it just says you know like i mentioned we just want to learn as much about you today as we can to help guide you through this back to school new norm that we live in and if you don't find your role there just go ahead and select one that is a best fit for you all right i'll give everyone just about 10 more seconds we'll close that pull up and we'll get moving and if you don't see the poll it will just be no need to worry all righty i'm going to go ahead and close the poll and then i just always like to share the results so i'm hoping that you can see these with us how familiar are you as a coder it seems like the general consensus is that most of you are familiar with coding but still learning and then majority of you are going to be in the beginner side which is perfectly great have you used code monkey before majority of you have actually not used code monkey before so that's good for us to know as well and then what is your role so it seems like the majority of people are elementary teachers or computer technology teachers so we're going to go ahead now and get started with today's webinar alright so we'd like to always start off with just talking about what is code monkey so code monkey is a learning program for kids that provides online engaging courses for students to learn how to code it's made with schools and teachers in mind we are standards aligned we do have a k8 coding curriculum and there is no prior experience needed to begin teaching with codemonkey and now we're just going to play the code monkey professional development series we envision a global playful learning experience where the next generations of coders are born and raised we aim to create an engaging platform where programming knowledge is acquired alongside 21st century skills through collaboratively playing and solving puzzles inventing creating and sharing why do we need to use code monkey for computational thinking coding is for everyone and concepts that everyone should know we are one of the best gamified platforms for teaching coding and computational thinking it is easy for both students and teachers alike what role does the teacher play in the code monkey platform the teacher facilitates the class checks for student understanding and fosters the ability for students to dive deeper into the various coding concepts codemonkey also has automated feedback loops with a rating scale to rate student solutions a three star means that the student was able to solve the challenge with the shortest most concise solution a two star means that the student was able to take what they learned and apply it to the challenge a one star means that the student was able to collect the bananas all right so we'll dive a little bit deeper into those concepts as we progress through today's webinar and like i mentioned if you have any questions along the way feel free to ask them we want to value your time as much as as we can during this time so now we're going to go ahead and meet the team so you can see exactly who it is that you're meeting today so first i want to start off by introducing myself my name is lena saleh and i am the professional development manager i'm here at code monkey i've been with code monkey for a few years now prior to that i taught in the classroom i taught at the elementary level and computer technology as well as rope curriculum for our district and i did that for a little over 10 years and now i also organize some meetups here in austin for a tech companies and teachers to meet together and kind of marry the partnership between them so now i'd like for you if you have any questions actually um you can always email me here at lena.s codemonkey.com or you can always tweet at me at lena codemonkey and i'm happy to answer those questions along the way now i'd like for you to meet my team hi everybody i'm talia marielle i'm the head of customer success at codemonkey i'm happy to be here with you and thank you for joining our webinar and i'll be taking your questions throughout the webinar so i hope you enjoy hi everybody my name is molly i am the director of sales here at code monkey um and i'm somewhat new to the company um just started here this past january but i will be helping out talia and lena as well with answering questions so again thank you for joining us today awesome thank you ladies so much um and just so you guys know talia is joining us from israel so she's up a little bit later than normal so thank you for taking that time with us today okay so what are we going to cover in today's webinar objectives today we are going to get familiar with the teachers homepage we're going to explore your code monkey classroom as well as the students access how to monitor students progress and what that will look like we'll also discuss what a selfpaced lesson looks like versus a structured lesson for that remote learning experience and then we'll talk about next steps and then we'll be some time definitely for some q a we also pulled some of your questions from your webinar registration that we're going to also answer here at the end but like i said feel free to answer any of those questions along the way um in the chat box actually right now if you wouldn't mind um just go ahead and letting us know if you are going back to school remote if you're going back to school student facing or if you're doing a mixture of the both hybrid i've been talking to a lot of teachers that are doing all three so kind of however you're going back to school just kind of lets us know how to guide today's discussion a little bit more all right and while you guys are taking the time to do that we're going to go ahead and get into the teacher's homepage i've actually already logged in under myself if you are not sure how to do that you can log in using a single sign on and so i used my google sign on today to just go ahead and log in i personally like to use google i like for everything to be synchronous so that i don't have to remember 9000 passwords i'm sure you might be the same way as well so once you do that it's fairly easy to just get logged in every single time i did skip that step just in the interest of time but if you have questions with that we do have some really great help articles to help you along the way as soon as i log in here to the teacher home page what you'll see right away is it pops us out into or pops us right onto the my classrooms page the my classrooms page oh good lots of people are oh some are doing 100 virtual it will be interesting to see how this year kind of progresses as well but once you're into the my classrooms page this is where you'll manage your classrooms and students accounts and we'll get back to that a little bit later as we dive in deeper on the upper right hand corner of the screen is where you will see basically if you think about it it's our it's a menu bar in the upper right hand corner is where you can access the ability to change our languages you will also see information about your account is located here our privacy policy we know that privacy is a really big concern just so everybody knows we are copa certified um and we are um in association with kidsafe so if anyone has any questions about privacy policy we're happy to send that information along as well our help center is located here and our help center are articles related to just anything that you might want to know code monkey related concepts courses there's a lot of wealth of information of resources that we've added there as well and then we have our blog if you're not following along on our blog we have lots of guest bloggers and we just try to talk about things that are relevant to you as a teacher and you can also contact us here pretty selfexplanatory there on the left hand side what we see here is in my classroom page which is where we're on right now which is why it's highlighted in green the courses and this is where you will be able to access and complete the courses included in your subscriptions so this is also what your students will see when they log in so this is the main page that they'll actually be able to see and i'm just going to briefly kind of cover our courses that we have here on our page just to kind of talk about what the courses are and if you're not sure about how the courses work we do have the ability to go ahead and customize some scope and sequences for you for just some suggestions but i would always check out our course page here which i'm about to show you okay so here are our code monkey courses i'm just going to give you a brief rundown of them and then i'll show you where they're located so um right away starting in kindergarten we do like i mentioned before stan k through eight we actually go into the higher range we do actually have a lot of high schoolers actually using some of our courses in their um you know intro to computer science courses and things like that so it actually does run the gamut of that we like to think about coding as a language so sometimes you may start in different places no matter what grade level you are you might start if i start learning spanish and my students start learning spanish we're really going to start learning in the same place so just kind of keep that in mind as we go through the courses so code monkey junior is our younger student block based course it is really about computational thinking directionality it teaches the basics of sequencing and loops and if you're interested in learning more about our courses we do have a webinar next week that's going to dive deeper into all of those courses and exactly what they look like um then we have our beaver achiever course that's really geared for our first first and second graders it is a block based course as well but it does dive into the loops conditionals and then if and else statements then we have our coding adventure which we start uh textbased coding really early which is in third grade um some students will even start it younger if they've been coding for a really long time in the block based um so we use coffeescript and coffeescript is a shorter version of javascript and python it's really the meat and potatoes of the language it doesn't have a lot of syntax it's really going to be tying kids down it's hard for them to remember where comma goes or curly bracket so we really wanted to make the students have the skill set to really progress to those harder languages as they move through then we have a math course which is a supplemental it works through angles distances and multiplication so they're working with math focused concepts while coding so those are really great to have as well and then we also have a game builder course and that really is teaching the game mechanics in order for the students to then build and design their own games to share out and then one of our newer courses in addition to the beaver achiever is our banana tales and that is a python course it is set up similar to our coding adventure course it does work through the coding concepts and then our coding chat box course where students code in python to build a interactive chatbot so how you will see that is all the courses are located here all the courses that are available in your subscription will be available for you if you see anything that has a lock on it it just means that it's not part of your subscription and just a reminder and then down here at the bottom sorry i forgot to mention this down here at the bottom in our creativity section is where the students can actually build and create their own challenges so that's for extra enrichment extra practice which we'll talk about a little bit at the end but we'll dive deeper into that next week actually um so you can complete any of the courses like i mentioned that your students have access to and what you'll do is you'll actually just click on them as students they will not be able to i'll show you what they won't be able to do but everyone will start out the same so you will just mine says redo course so i'll just click on it and yours will say start coding so when you click on the course itself you can begin doing playing the course and then you'll kind of go through there you'll progress through the challenges the same as your students just something to note the students don't have the ability to skip around throughout the courses it is designed for them to learn linearly through the coding concepts so just kind of keep that in mind as a teacher you are able to move around and navigate the challenges because we want you to have more of a flexibility than to be tied down and have to do the whole coding course we want you to have those tools in your tool set to kind of move through there okay so that's how you would begin any of the coding courses like i mentioned in the tour to courses we will tour de france but to order courses we will dive deeper into what each one of those look like so i would recommend that as well next is on the lefthand side is our teacher resources under the under the teacher resources we have our teaching with coding adventure and that's where you'll be able to access our teaching i mean where it will take an indepth look of the coding concepts that are covered in coding adventure part one you can also have access to all of our webinars current and past webinars that are coming up where you can register and find all those things which you were probably directed to to for today's webinar then underneath here is all of our fully guided lesson plans they have our standards aligned with all of them they are pdf versions of them and then briefly i'll just mention that well i'll go back to the lesson plans as well but that's where all the lesson plans are located and then here you'll have your howto guide so these are short video tutorials we also have the access to the help center which you notice in the up here in the upper right hand corner the beginner's guide to code monkey is just a lot as a pdf version of everything kind of all located in one location um getting started videos and then we have just some short tutorials on things like how to upgrade your subscription archiving how to access certain challenges um they're really great and informational and in the honor of time short for you as well um and then also i'd like to mention we do have notes for the hour of code we also have these classroom resources which do have certificates for all of our courses there's also a media kit so if you want the cute images that we have as well uh classroom posters and then we do have some coloring pages which have been really good for like after school clubs and things like that are just things to fill the students time with um and then newest to here is the solution so this is where you can access all of the solutions it's kind of like a cheat sheet for you for all of the courses that we offer you can have the solution for everything so those are there for you those are the three star solutions for every single course that we offer and then moving right along on the left hand side is the my creations the my creations are if you use the challenge builder or the game builder to create your own challenges this is where your specific challenges will be located and the students will see this as well let's see the courses um the my creations and the discover page so under the my creations you'll see here are all of the um basically challenges that i've created within the lifetime of my account they're all located here they're located with games and challenges so those are just my personal creations that i've created then over here we have the discover page and the discover page is where students and teachers can publish publicly and when you publish a challenge publicly there are the community guidelines so we make sure that there's no student information that everything is very safe if we ever have questions about you know something questionable like a student adding a word that we might not think you know that could kind of cross a line we definitely don't approve them so i'll just let you know that as well so all of the students that have published those are there i do like to mention this this is just something for teachers to know that basically when the students do publish to the discover it makes a copy of their challenge so they can't go back through and try to change it you can also remix oops excuse me once you click on the game itself you can also remix those games as well and so it will also let you know that the students have remixed those games so just some little tidbits to kind of keep in mind as you're going through then moving on we do have um the help center is also located here and i'll just briefly just talk about that so we do have our getting started for teachers classroom dashboard just really any questions that you that you would like to have most of them have videos attached or just really descriptive for questions that you may have so we always recommend checking that out first okay so now we are going to move on if you have any questions about that part you can go ahead and let me know so we just talked about how you get to log in and then now we're going to actually go into the code monkey classroom itself and talk about students access so now we're going to do the steps to create a classroom how to set up a student account continuing with a previous code monkey classroom and then adding coteacher so we're going to kind of walk through all of this part as far as setup goes so the first steps when for setting up your new subscription whether you have a trial or a purchase a purchased trial that you've purchased or a purchase subscription that how you're going to go about this is you're going to be populated right you know you'll be put right into the my classrooms page and on the my classrooms page what you'll do is you'll create a classroom so when you click here on the on the classroom you can do two things so you can create a new classroom and add the name of the classroom which you would like to name it and just make sure you select the appropriate subscription or new to us as you can import from google classroom so when you connect to the google classroom it will go ahead and pull your students from the google classroom right into code monkey here into the code monkey classroom so you don't have to do giving them a class code or any of that kind of thing so it just creates that seamless transition for students to do that so i actually want to show you that itself so i have i'm going to share with you a another screen so i can show you what that will look like when you do do the when you do create with a google classroom because i know that's a big question right now especially with the learning management so when i create a classroom here i can just import from google and the classroom that i have here is named monday i make sure i have it attached the correct subscription and then i create my classroom some things to note here is that you can't actually edit the students names once they're populated but everything is completely coppa compliant and what you'll see is that i don't have a class code that's here because it's already made i don't need to share a class code or create anything with them as well okay so that is that part of the classroom creating a classroom and so when i click onto it all those students will be populated which we'll show you here in just a moment okay so now that we've taken a look at importing the google classroom which is one of my favorite things to do make my life a little bit easier um we can also so i've created that so let's create our classroom so i'll just name it webinar for today and i make sure i attach it to my correct subscription and then when i create the classroom it will populate here you see i have a lot of classrooms created right now i don't have any students in my classroom i do have a class code i can see which subscription it's attached to i can also edit this i can also archive this which just means it will no longer appear on my screen but the data will still remain in the classroom and then if i want to upgrade to a subscription is where i would do that as well so now that we are we've created our classroom let's go ahead and look at what it looks like to create a student account because that's what you all want to know is how to how do we even create our student accounts so as we can see here there are no students in my classroom so i'm going to click create student account and i can add a student here so what i do is i add the student i can share the class code if i want here i can also do a bulk upload so a bulk upload means that i have 50 students in my classroom and i want to upload the 50 students there is a csv file that it will give you as an example and we just recommend anytime you're creating any type of student information is that you're just keeping it you know with their first name and their lesson initially you're not doing anything as far as sharing extra information that doesn't need to be shared um they are really um hyping up privacy right now i've heard that from a lot of teachers that they've been asking a lot of questions about privacy and doing privacy checks so i would just really recommend that you're making sure that you are doing your part to keep your students information safe as well because we do our part to not collect information so we we hope that you do the same so then i can also create an account so i can put a display name if i want or i can just put um let's just say i create my student account here and then i create my password try to keep the password something that the students can remember and then what i do is i click create and once i do it tells me that the user has been successfully created and now they're going to be in my classroom now that i have a student in my classroom i can do a couple um a couple of different things here and what i can do is i can actually move let's say this is an old classroom from another location ooh actually let's talk about this so you can print student login cards if you would like here that's obviously more tactile for the students i know we're really trying to eliminate the use of extra papers and different things like that or you can do a classroom direct login url and so what you do is you embed this in your web page you click on it the students will have a picture and they'll just click on their picture and they'll add their their password and so that's just there if the students are single signon users however if they are using a google classroom or even just a google login we would want to stay away from doing this direct login url that's just a few they're not single signon associated um okay so we can also so here what i can do is let's say this is a really old classroom and i want to move them to uh another classroom i can either archive this whole classroom all at once really quickly or i can move them to a new classroom you can also do the same here with each of the students once you archive a student they will be removed from your classroom but their data will remain and you can also move them like i mentioned to another classroom so they move you know different to another classroom and so you just move them and so there's they're still there keeping all of their data and then you can also delete a student you can notice here that i can delete this student only because there is no student progress so that's just something to keep in mind once a student has logged in and began you can no longer remove them so they do occupy a seat on that um brooke that's a great question and i think um a member of my team will actually answer that and then i'll also answer that question at the end because that's a really good question for us as well um okay so we have um talked about the student list here and i just want to mention that if you have a coteacher in your classroom that you are wanting to maybe your team teaching you can actually actually add the teacher here and send them an invitation and then they will have the ability to have the same level of access to that classroom as you do all right um i'll go back to how to upgrade a subscription in just a minute but let's talk about um now that we're in the student list we've created a student um we're going to talk about how to assign courses and then i'll go back to the progress and some of the pieces that you probably want to know most of all so here in the courses tab remember i'm in a classroom and now i'm on the courses tab for that specific classroom i can go ahead and assign the courses any classroom that does any corset is not assigned to the classroom is going to be green and anything that is already assigned is grayed out so that you know that it's there so i can just quickly click on it and it'll say it's unassigned and i can click on it again and assign so it's fairly easy to assign unassigned courses to your students um something that i do want to know we do get a lot of questions about this so i'll just bring it i feel like now is a good time to bring it up if you have all of the coding adventure courses assigned to your students or all of the banana tales or all of the beaver achiever anything that has a three has a succession of courses together so like coding adventure beaver achiever banana tales even if this all of the courses are assigned the students do still have to work linearly through those concepts and they'll unlock as they go along so i just would like to mention that as well okay so now that we have assigned courses um and we talked about setting up a student account and we've talked about adding teachers to the coteachers i want to talk about how to monitor monitor student progress and our gradebook we'll also talk about that as well so monitoring student progress is um obviously important it's important for everyone to kind of know where their students are as well so let me just go ahead and get into a classroom that has some student data in it and we can talk about some different components that are going to be important to kind of investigate as we go along so here i am in my student progress page all of the courses have their own basically progress tables for the course so let's just click on our coding adventure course what we can see here is that i can sort the students i can see how far the students have progressed here along the um right here on the lefthand side where the students names are where the student name list is i can also sort by student progress and so when i do that i'm able to see you know the top the students at the top that have the most progress are going to be there and then it's going to you know go down as it goes through so we can see the ones with the least amount of progress are going to be at the bottom um some also things to note here is in our coding adventure course beaver achiever banana tales most of our courses except for the game design course all have three star solutions so three star solution is the shortest most concise code a two star means that the student took an extra step something that what would have been there and one star means that the student was able to collect that banana but i like to say that they're on the struggle rust probably didn't really understand the concept that was there took a lot of extra steps that were not needed so great creates really good conversational pieces so what you can see here is that i can sort by sort of by my student progress and i can see that in this specific challenge here challenge 16. um just so you know all of these numbers along the top are the solutions as well so you can access them on the teacher resource page or you can do this specifically in the progress page it does report live so as the students are working it is populating into the progress page here for you but let's say i have a student who is what i like to call the struggle blesser i click on this star here i'm able to see how many times this student attempted the challenge and we can see that the student attempted this challenge four times i'm going to click on it and when i do it gives me a real life animation it gives me their exact solution in how they solved it so i'm able to see it in real time exactly how they solved it and it also pulls up anonymously for some really good conversation for you to have as well it also it's not like a writing sample where you pull with a writing simply cut off their name and you put it up there and everyone knows that person's writing so this way it gives a really anonymous um you know authentic conversation to have and learning to have with your students um something else to kind of mention too is that your teacher solutions when you pull them up they actually won't say teach your solution across the top so you can also share those two um if you're trying to compare some different solutions something else to note here is that every single star that is reported back to here in this in this page every single one of them contains a solution all of them live here in this page so you can always click on any of them and kind of see when they did that if you're looking for something that's a little bit more robust maybe you want to see a little bit more information you can export that data to a csv file and it will really break it down for you exactly how they did it and the file can be quite large so it does give some really detailed information there for coding adventure we do have a skill mode so that's deeper dive into the coding concepts that are there as you notice here each of these this has the concepts actually here in the gradebook and that does match the courses themselves so just something to note there too and those solutions are there for you as well as the student solutions there um we can also limit the student progress so i currently have them limited i actually um have some younger siblings and they're actually working in this page right now um so i have them limited because i'm really trying to keep track of what they're doing and where they are so basically what that means when i've limited a student's progress as you can see here they are actually not able to progress beyond challenge number 20. um so just to kind of keep that in mind because you know what happens they go through they complete the challenges before you're ready for them to complete and this is just a way for you to kind of keep everyone all together if you want to unlock it obviously it's up to your discretion you are the teacher you know what's best so that's why we give you the flexibility to kind of have that as well and now you see i've unlocked it i just clicked on the limit progress i clicked free play and i was able to unlock all of the challenges we're going to talk about lesson modes in just a moment but you can also limit the progress based on the last lesson that was taught so there's also that a little bit more flexibility there as far as that goes so i'm just going to go ahead and limit this back up here just so they don't progress beyond where i want them to go i'll probably forget later and then what i can also do in our coding adventure course is turn on or off super hints so this is really good especially in your remote learning environment is that this will give students an extra set of hints there's always hints within our platform but this will give us this will give the students some extra hints and i'll show you this in just a minute but you can turn it on or turn it off here as well um okay so now let's go ahead and we've talked about the progress tab and what each of the stars mean how to limit we talked about the solutions and what that looks like next we're going to talk about the grade book so code monkey does this really wonderful thing and i know when i was teaching in the classroom i always um wanted to know that andrea that's a really great question i'm actually going to um answer that in just a second um so here in the grade book it's going to you have a couple of two different choices here this is automatically graded for you so always makes your life a little bit easier you can change it from letters numbers and percentages and then you can also calculate it between the different coding concepts you have every there is a gradebook for every single course within your subscription that you have available to you you can also export that as a csv file and that's just something to know at the bottom here of the page it will tell you how far the students have progressed through the challenges average score on assessment so in the coding adventure course itself there are builtin assessment challenges and so that is reporting the score for that there also there are the challenges by difficulty so the more students that struggle with a specific challenge the larger these circles become when you click on these circles themselves it pulls up the challenge so you can solve and work through it together so another place to have more student data and to have that student deep dive of data to really drive your instruction and then something that's brand brand new to us is this proficiency table so it's kind of hidden here you might quickly overlook it if you didn't know it was there but here is the proficiency table that we just recently added so we have four different levels here we have a novice we have a beginner intermediate and advanced and this is progress within every single code monkey course and the subjects that are covered there the coding concepts they're not subjects but coding concepts and talia just put a really great article for you to read up to for later but we can see the coding concepts that are covered here and then we can see exactly how the students um have done within each of the coding concepts throughout all of the courses so this tells you how proficient they are within the concepts themselves so that's just something that's new to us brand new there okay so now we have talked about the gradebook and the proficiency tab and then and just really quickly i do want to mention the showroom and then i'll talk about these lessons here so in the showroom this is when the students have created and built their own challenges they will actually um be able to um they'll populate here for you so you'll be able to see them so you have the access to the games and the challenges and then there's some ways that you can share them publicly with you know parents for that extra deep dive for that extra buyin for them to kind of play and interact with that as well um you can also disable the discover here and so that means that when you disable it the students cannot share to the discover and so that's kind of just giving you a little bit more discretion if you would like as well um okay so now let's talk about one of my favorites which is the lessons tab i will mention that the lessons right now are currently only available for the coding adventure course just the lesson um feature here we obviously all the lesson plans are still available but this specific one is only for the coding adventure course as of right now so you select a specific coding adventure course what happens is that this is broken up exactly how our lesson plans are so all of our lesson plans are set up in the exact same manner there is an intro which is an unplugged activity then you have or some kind of the introduction to the coding concept that the students are working on then you have play time so that's the chance where students are then working through the challenges themselves um you can assign specific challenges within the lesson itself here which is really great um and then you have debris so usually it's a reflection or sometimes you're doing a walk through or sometimes even the play time you might do a walkthrough so all of those are going to be here for you as well and then you can have access to those specific challenges that are there within the lesson so you're not having to navigate throughout 9000 screens everything is right here located for you when you begin the lesson what happens is the students get a big lock on their screen and not just a lock on the course is a big lock on their screen saying that they cannot progress until you've ended the lesson so that creates the ability to kind of lock them down a little bit more and keep them with you while you work on the lesson itself the specific lesson plan is located here for that specific lesson and it's going to have everything on it the objectives overall what are you going to be working on the specific components so those are like the coding concepts that you're going to be working on um what are you going to be working on a variable and an assignment variable and then the standards that are addressed which i'll discuss this a little bit more but we do have common core alignment we also have cst alignment and we do have specific state alignment so if you're looking for that we can talk about that also um and then that's just how the lesson plan is there play time intro debrief okay um all right now let me go back here once i mark the i can do two things i can end the lesson or i can mark it as complete once i mark it as complete that means that the lesson has now ended we also for coding adventure i'll show you where the reference cards are for the other ones but we do have a reference card that just lets them know what each of the buttons mean just a reminder it's a really good visual reminder for students and then we also have a character review card this character review card is really important when you're working through the challenge builder because as the students progress through the um through the courses or through the through the course itself the more characters and objects unlock so this will let you know when those characters are going to be unlocked like in 55 i know i can now introduce a beaver and then in 66 i can now work with the crocodile so we do get a lot of questions sometimes surrounding that so just and some information for you to have as well okay so now we've worked through all the features of the classroom page itself um so i noticed there's been some really good questions about somebody asked i just want to stop and ask this question because i think it's a very good question are grades available per class and individuals they are available they're actually per individual it's not specific to to the course itself so we can see here that this student a b monkey we can see exactly how they scored obviously it's an overall gradebook for the class but they are individual grades so we don't just pull like a whole class grade like everyone got a b um but there is a usage report that you can actually pull so i can show you i'll show you that in just a uh just a quick moment and then i'll just answer there's one more question too um that i would like to answer too so um unplugged activities are available in the resources when you subscribe that is correct so basically are they available for you so as soon as you subscribe to a code monkey subscription all of those features are basically unlocked for you so you have available to all of the lesson plans so they're not like locked down for you at all um so those will just be available for you and they're always in in those lesson plans so if you have questions finding those we can kind of help you also on the blog there's some really great articles about some unplugged activities that you can do and we're going to actually talk about that here in just a few moments i'm just running quickly i can notice out of time so i just want to make sure i'm honoring that amy had a really good question too when you mark com when you mark it complete can a student not access that lesson any longer in case they didn't finish or miss a lesson um actually that is that is a really good question when you are in lesson mode itself basically um what happens is that when you begin this lesson the students can only have access to those challenges so they are only working through the specific challenges and as i hover over you can see it's probably quite small for you but you can see that they are the specific challenges that are related to lessons so they can only have access to that so once you end it then it opens back up to wherever they have progressed through um so then i would recommend making sure that you have that limit progress button on or something like that so if they miss it which happens you know kids are absent and they miss lessons and whatever then that way they're still able to catch up and basically be on the same page but this also gives the ability for those students who are farther behind to be able to work through the same challenges that you're working through together during your lesson so just some differentiation pieces there okay so we talked about monitoring student progress now we're going to talk a little bit about selfpaced lessons versus structured lessons so um basically when we're talking about selfpaced we're basically talking about um you know the students are at home they're not with you live um so what you can do is you can assign the specific courses you can give students you know super hints which we talked about so basically what happens is gordo has this light bulb here for like an extra um he has he has a light bulb here and so when he has a super hit you'll click on it um the beaver achiever course also does the same thing where they have a hint you can see exactly the code it's not the answer but it gets them closer to the answer oops excuse me then you can also review if you're not there with the students you know because you're doing remote learning or maybe they're just not even with you you can review the previous challenges so i always recommend for students who are struggle bussing it um to go back to previous challenges and play those previous challenges sometimes you just need a refresher and just going through it one time you know if i only learned how to ride my bike one time i would never be very good sometimes sometimes you have to go back and practice um just doing what it is and and coding is just not a natural concept right like i don't come out of the womb knowing how to program so um the students don't either so just encouraging them to go back to play those previous challenges and just making sure that they read the instructions this is really important for our game builder courses as well as our coding chatbot courses it's they're pretty text heavy so it's really important for them to read those instructions or clicking on just reading instructions in general i you all are teachers so you know exactly um you know exactly how that goes okay um and then if you also can provide them with the solution if they want or really having them ask a friend so i always recommend collaborating fostering that collaboration is going to be key because you don't want teachers you don't want students copy and pasting their answers um to each other and then sometimes you might have to provide them with a solution um i do think i was just listening to a podcast from marina bears if you don't know who she is she was one of the she works with scratch and as the developer is the main person who developed scratch jr and she was talking about you know what is the difference between having a teacher and having a student just code at home and the and the missing component of all of it is you you're the missing piece and so they really need you to kind of help them work through the thinking you know sometimes it's just thinking out loud of different things so those are just possibilities so i encourage that communication happen we'll talk about what that communication could look like um and then the difference and then a structured lesson so a structured lesson is obviously working through the lessons within coding adventure assigning them a course making sure you monitor the progress limit within the courses you know really using the lesson feature or just at least limiting them um and then that way you guys you can even limit them to zero so they can't see it when you're doing the lesson if you're working in another course and then when you're ready then you give them back the ability to kind of progress through the challenges so there's just a lot of flexibility to do that and if you're not sure about it you can always ask us a member of the team we're happy to help walk you through that as well but um i i personally like structured lessons just me i really don't like my students to progress through i don't feel like they get as much of a depth of knowledge if they are not working together with us and having that communication so just fostering that communication and collaboration is a really big piece especially with coding um okay so um we talked about that so let's talk about some like next steps or some different things that you can do so um we recently just did a challenge builder competition that page still lives at the bottom footer of the codemonkey.com page you can see it there but i recommend the students really creating and building their own challenging challenges for mastery and one for creativity it can get really boring just going through the concepts although code monkey's quite fun it's not typical that somebody would say it's boring but um this is just a really good way to create extra engagement the students can share out their challenges and play them with each other and it's also a good way to do uh feedback loops so having the students you know maybe they don't know exactly which student created that challenge and you give them the challenge and they complete it and maybe they give some code commenting or some different ways to kind of work through the thinking you know the computational thinking model or even the engineering design process are really good strategies to use when building and creating your own challenges you can also connect it to other disciplines so this is um one of the challenges that we got um from from the challenge builder competition that we recently did and this was um not something that we told the students to do we just had a specif a few rules for them to kind of complete so if you want those guidelines those are there um but he basically tells a story oh of course okay well i'll pull that up here in just a moment but basically he tells a story so he actually interacts here with these characters so there is a save function um within the coding adventure course and so he turns to this go and i'll pull this up in just a couple minutes i don't know why it's not playing up right now but um so he turns to the monkey and the monkey turns to the goat and he talks to them about moving and then the then the beaver has to move so he can get across basically when you progress through these challenges the bear and the tiger are both hungry for both the monkey and the goat so they want to eat him so there's some different functions and things that progress through there so there's a lot of different ways to use storytelling um even a math concept like what's two plus two and then they go through and they move him if he gets the correct answer you know just just doing some if statements and working in some different um interdisciplinary um you know content areas that are really important for that um and then the lesson plans there are some really great activities from the lesson plans themselves which i'm going to come back to this page here but i personally really love to use the code code monkey junior lesson plans i know this is for the younger kids but it's really about the computational thinking which is really what you want to have happen i personally just am a big big fan of these lesson plans and the unplugged activities that they have here um so inside of this so on this second lesson plan that's in here it has instructional cards that you basically print out so what i used to do was i would um you know have the students create cards or you can have them do like a google slide and you kind of have like a grid and have the students basically program an object or you know you can have the students do this offline where they come up with their own activity and they can record it and send it to you there's lots of different variations that you can do with these unplugged activities which we'll talk more in the uh intro and sorry in the tour de courses we can talk a little bit more about that as well but these lesson plans are really really great um for working with students and i really like to use them as an opener to my coding courses i just i just am obsessed with using them because i think it gets kids moving and even if you're doing remote learning you can do unplugged activities without being directly in front of the code monkey platform together so you can utilize these resources so i'd recommend just using those they're one of my favorite things to do and then the next thing is just kind of communicating with your students creating those open feedback loops the biggest part about being a computer programmer is that there's a lot of failure that's involved with computer programming if you talk to anyone computer programming who's been on a sprint meaning they've worked multiple hours and days on a project um a lot of times a syntax error will happen or they need to you know collaborate but just creating those feedback loops we don't have that specifically built into the platform but i have seen some teachers do some really great things in google classroom or canva or whatever it is that you're kind of using with the students to kind of communicate about that and have them communicate their thinking because the deeper that they can go within their thinking you know being able to teach something creates a greater mastery of a concept um something that we did want to mention just for some different things as far as tips for communication i took this from a teach with technology facebook group also tcea had some of these images as well but there are some google meet expectations for when students come in um google just did some really good updates also to the google me if you're not sure they just had a conference yesterday so i would recommend checking that out we also have some zoom expectations here too just making sure that you know you're chatting responsibly um that kind of thing i also recommend recording and then disabling the chat while you're working through we've done some live lessons during covert with students and we really had to make sure everything was pretty blocked down um and just making sure that they know they to be in a quiet place and just some things you know it's a little bit different they have a little bit more exposure now as we're going through but just making sure we have that ability as well so now we are now we've talked about the teachers homepage the classroom and the student access how to monitor students progress the difference between a selfpaced lesson and a structured lesson next steps and now we're going to give some time for q a i see a lot of questions here that that i didn't um have the ability to answer and then i'm also going to answer some of your questions i know where how our time is working here so um i'll just go ahead and talk about that and then i will also answer these questions here on the side and any questions that you have in the chat box itself okay um so one of the questions that had been asked beforehand was how much coding knowledge is needed by a teacher so to begin code monkey and any of the courses within codemonkey you don't need to have a ton of coding knowledge but i would recommend taking that teaching with coding adventure course it's going to walk you through concepts like what is a function um what is a for loop what does a for loop mean what exactly is a times loop and what exactly does the times loop mean it is me so um working through that so you get to hear my voice again i'm sure you're pretty excited about that but um it'll be me working through the concepts with you talking about each one of those as well another question was how do you tie coding with robotics well in robotics themselves even with the blocks that are used with most robotics that there are um there's a lot of computational thinking one that's in there so i would say definitely working through the computational thinking model it's always a way of problem solving but also there's a lot of concepts in the first part of coding venture or one of the whatever course you kind of choose that will actually tie to robotics like a times loop or a for loop or just talking about a function like how do we make the robot move so there's a lot of components that when they take the actual hard coding itself then they're beta better able to program the robotics because now they have a really strong background knowledge of information to kind of deliver um how do i know which standards code monkey is aligned to so i did mention that i was going to talk about how you can figure out where those are so if you go to the bottom of codemonkey.com you'll see there is a standards page here if you want more a deeper dive into this concepts or the standards that are covered just ask whoever basically your sales rep that you're working with or talia she's very great with helping with that but you can see the specific concepts that are covered here um we do have specific reports for just like csta or whatever but they are in the lesson plan as well for you okay um all right next question is um distance learning strategy so just some strategies that i recommend are having the students work offline with some of the coding concepts that they're working on they're working on functions why can't they go outside most of them have cell phones so their parents have a cell phone and have them record and have them do their own unplugged activity of that concept another strategy is having them you know work with those game builder or challenge builders some different ways to kind of show the mastery of learning in a new way and i also really recommend working with like writing problems like having the students write out exactly what it is that you're um you're going to do okay so those are some of the questions from today and then i just had this question here what was the name of the beginner teacher course webinar and how to access that so under the teacher resources um you'll see the teaching with code monkey tab uh that's from the main screen just on the left hand side you click on teacher resources here it's the teaching with coding adventure course um and there you'll see the course overview and then you'll go all the way to four loops array in indexes say and distance two variables which is a really important concept to kind of go over so i i personally recommend taking that um i found that a lot of teachers that have done it and that i recommend them taking it have a much stronger foundation there's also a teacher that i've been working with directly and she actually learned how to program from working with code monkey so just a lot of capabilities as far as that goes okay how many hours per week do you recommend using code monkey um i think it depends on what it is that you're doing is code monkey your sole program are you integrating it with other subject areas and and that so i would recommend typically we say that a lesson one lesson in coding adventure covers five challenges and that is typically 45 minutes so i personally would recommend that you do so basically the coding adventure lesson plans are broken up is there's two two lessons for almost every concept that's covered i would say taking a blend of that lesson and then having them work through at least 10 of the challenges and 10 of the skill mode challenges if i were doing coding adventure that's what i would do um but if you're integrating it with math i would have them write out the specific because in coding adventure there is um a ruler measurement and angle measurement so i would integrate that and then i also would have them do um you know like a writing prompt surrounding that so some just some different capabilities so if you're interested you can always reach out to us um we do have a clean looking facebook group that you can jump into and really ask those questions we really encourage that soon our teacher ambassadors will be running that a little bit more so that will kind of happen as we go um all right when you mark complete can a student not access the lesson any longer so i answered that question i mentioned marina bears somebody said i just purchased kevo kits for our school do you believe code monkey would complement working with kibo i do think the code monkey junior and beaver achiever course would really complement what they're doing i know that that's a really unplugged type of thing that she's doing there but i do think that those would support what it is that you're doing and we can always talk about that in a little bit more complexity if you would like to just in honor of y'all's time today all right talia um molly do you guys have any questions that i didn't get to no i we have some individuals that we're going to follow up with directly after the webinar i think we have a couple more in the queue that we are still answering but you've covered the rest excellently all right great just finished just on time but if you guys have any followup questions kind of as we you know go through i apologize i wasn't able to show you that example of the students but it's really great so if you want me to show it to you i will um follow up with me via email and i'm happy to do that um just remember that next week i've mentioned this several times throughout today's webinar um that we do have a tour to courses coming up next wednesday so or the 18th so excuse me next tuesday so that will be there for you so i will be going through all the courses and really touring them looking into the courses themselves and talking just a little bit deeper about that side of things today we just wanted to give you the back end of every all the details as well um so if you have any questions regarding help so you are stuck on something you're not sure where to go you can um contact us at support codemonkey.com if you um you know anything that you're kind of struggling with and we'll make sure we get that routed to the correct person to answer your question um you can also always go to help.codmonkey.com use that help center i promise there's some really amazing resources there that would really um help guide you and if you can't get the answers you're looking for reach back out to us at the support
