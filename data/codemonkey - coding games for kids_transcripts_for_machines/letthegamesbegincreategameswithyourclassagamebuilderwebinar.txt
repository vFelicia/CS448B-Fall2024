i'd like to welcome everybody i definitely say thank you to all of you that have joined us today uh it's always great to get together and discuss ways that we can help our students as they continue to learn coding now before we dive uh too deep into the webinar i'll mention that if you haven't already done so please follow us across all of our social media channels you can find us on instagram and twitter at codemonkeystu you can also get valuable updates on code monkey's facebook page as well as our code monkey blog which you can find on our website at codemonkey.com and if you wish to live tweet at us today during today's webinar you can do so using the hashtag codemonkeywebinar and we will do our best to answer any of your live tweets i have a team with me today so i'm not alone which is good news uh we're all here to answer any questions that you may have i do want to ask that if you have a question please drop it in our chat box or in our q a so that way everyone can see it and then lastly i'll let everybody know that we will be sending out information regarding your pd certificate directly following the webinar so please look out for that in your email all right so for those of you who have not had the pleasure of meeting yet my name is mark dozier i am part of the customer success team at code monkey i joined the group at the start of the school year prior to that i spent the last 16 years as an educator i started as a fifth grade teacher here in texas a fifth grade science teacher before moving on to chicago where i worked as a technology director as well as a computer science teacher there i did mention that i had friends with me today so i do want to introduce or allow two of my amazing colleagues to introduce themselves hi everyone uh my name is lena saleh i am the professional development and sales manager here at code monkey you can reach me at lena.s at codemonkey.com or you can live tweet at me today at lena or sorry at lena codemonkey just a little bit of background about me i'm a former educator as well i spent over 10 years in the classroom and now i'm just very passionate about delivering computer science to students all right thank you lena hey i'm jay bloodworth i am the curriculum developer here at codemonkey um like mark i'm pretty new to the company i've been here for about six months now um but have had a good time before that i worked for 20 years as a middle school teacher here in south carolina mostly math but also a computer science course that i designed myself so that's kind of the role i'm in now writing the computer science curriculum for good monkey all right thanks lena and jay and i think i speak for all of us when i say that it's it's my hope that when speaking with you all today that we're going to be able to provide everybody with the confidence that you're going to need to effectively teach our game creation courses and then by accomplishing that the goal is you're going to allow your students to really take off and show how creative they can be so with that let's get ready to write code catch bananas and sing the world all right so taking a look at our objectives you can see the areas that we are going to cover today we will explain what is included in the game builder package i'm also going to define what we mean by game creation i will explain why we use it after coding adventure then we'll get into the first parts of platformer which is one of those game creation courses we'll also explain uh what game builder is and when you should use it then we'll show you guys some examples from students that could be found in our discover tab and then as always of course we will leave time at the end for your questions in our q a session so which courses are we referring to when we say game creation game builder what which which courses are part of that game builder package so here you see that game creation is composed of three tutorial based courses uh platformer which we'll cover today frogger and then sprite animations and then over to the far right you see game builder which is a standalone platform it's a sort of a sandbox style uh where the kids can just create from the ground up now with platformer your students are going to learn the fundamentals of game creation by building a game that's very similar to super mario bros they're going to be introduced to game mechanics such as keyboard events and timers in the frog course students will learn how to program a touchscreen game as they build a game that's very similar to that arcade classic frogger uh the course will also teach them how to program a game that utilizes the swiping motion that you're going to find in a mobile or tablet setting and then with the sprite animation course uh your students are going to learn how to create and basically bring to life uh sprites that can be used in the games that they create and then all this culminates with our game builder platform and that'll be the place where your students are going to take those game creation basics and then hopefully wow you with their own uh games that they've made all right so what is game creation so perhaps you've noticed in my course description that i use the word create a lot i use it very liberally and having taught you know elementary and middle school computer science i think we all can agree that it's really important to have that component and also from a buyin view so it's not just teacher says do this i do this but now we're getting into i learned this let me show you that so to do this in game creation what we need to do is we need to give them a peek under the hood okay so we want to introduce them to the building blocks and these game mechanics then bring them to a point where they're ready to pair that knowledge with their creativity uh in the game builder platform so why do we use it after we complete coding adventure so this is done because coding adventure is going to establish a really strong foundation for them it's going to be a base level that will allow them greater success in game creation also there's going to be concepts that are introduced at the end of coding adventure that are expanded upon at the very beginning of game creation all right so as i mentioned earlier we will get into game creation by starting with the first lesson of platformer now technically speaking you can start with any of the game any of those three game creation courses but i chose platformer today primarily for as i said earlier the similarities to the super mario brothers games uh and your students are actually going to instantly recognize the connections between the two so it's a good jumping off point now in case some of you are unfamiliar with where the lesson plans can be found i'm going to point out that you can find them under the teacher resources so here this is your teacher home page under the teacher resources i have lesson plans and if i scroll down i find the game builder package and you see here platformer is the first one there also with these lessons you'll see they're very similar to coding adventure and that in the way that they're structured uh so the lessons are basically broken up into three parts so you'll start with your introduction and it usually includes objectives and components so the components to think of those as the concepts that are going to be learned part two let's scroll down a little bit more so part two will put the play time this is where the students will actually explore the lesson and then of course we end with part three with our debrief so in platformer i want to point out that you will have seven lessons and each of them is designed for about uh 45 minutes all right so to jump jump start this platform of course we're going to use a very cool and engaging unplugged activity and unplugged activities hopefully you know by now are these critical pieces in each of our code monkey lessons and at their core they allow you as a teacher to break down what can sometimes be a difficult concept into something that's uh you know relatable and easy to understand so this particular unplugged activity that we're going to show you guys today is going to serve as an introduction to a major concept that you're going to find throughout game design and that concept is this concept of event driven programming so i know it may look a little complicated but honestly what i can tell you is it's not on the left what you're looking at is the way that students are sort of used to thinking about coding at least up to this point uh so you know you have lines of code and they're going to be executed in order now on the right which we're seeing is this new concept of event driven programming and the idea here is that a computer program as we know is a set of instructions telling the computer how to process input and deliver a certain output an important part of that program is telling the computer when to perform a certain task so events are a way to trigger certain instructions so let's dive into the unplug activity so as you can see here the materials and preparation needed are going to be pretty minimal you'll need two sets of colored index cards uh the first color and in our example here we're using the color red will be our designated event cards and on each event card you're going to write down one of three events such as cross arms clap hands or pat your head the other color is going to be for your handler pile now each of these cards is going to need a conditional statement such as when someone crosses their arms i'm going to take a knee or when someone claps their hands i will say jumanji now to help you guys understand how this is going to work um i actually do have a video that was filmed at our code monkey studios so let's get to that okay all right so i don't know if those guys are going to be winning any oscars anytime soon but they did a great job um so what what they've done here is you have to start by distributing those cards face down and then you form two lines uh one line's for events the other line is for handlers next you want to go down on the line one at a time having each student perform the action that is on their card or the command that's on their card then your handlers are going to react based on the behavior that they saw on the events line and then maybe after one time down the line you can switch roles uh events will trade with handlers there's also an opportunity here to have the students maybe rewrite the code just to see how you know maybe the first time when a person folded their arms i jumped up but now someone rewrote the code and now i'm going to turn off the lights or something like that now if you see any holdouts if you still have holdouts as far as buyins with the students even after that activity and i promise you if you show them this um this activity which is actually taken directly from the lesson plan it's a short video uh and we kind of use it to show students the possibilities we're going to show them what it is we hope to get from this platformer course so i'll go ahead and play a little bit for you guys and this will be something that you show the kids and again this is directly from the lesson plan so it's easily accessible for you as a teacher alright so watch out for the tigers and chocolates i see a tiger i'm also old school and i need more of a playstation controller all right so there uh what we saw was a lot of those elements are going to come into play we saw a timer there was objects there were good guys bad guys um in the times where we've shown this we've taken our visits to schools this is really what gets the students going so the job for you is to get them calmed down and get ready for the beginning of the lesson uh and with that i'm going to turn it back over to jay who's going to guide us through lesson one of this platformer course all right yep let me get out set up so you can see my screen and we'll get going with this all right it should be there for you now um so this is lesson one which is going to encompass uh the first five exercises of the platformer course and i want to go through these fairly quickly introduce you to what the screen looks like and all the elements that we're using here um but also explain a little bit of the computer science and coding times that um find what they're doing what your students will be doing so let's look at the screen um we've got basically three columns here the column left is where the instructions are and then at the bottom it has a little checklist where the steps are broken down some of these exercises have multiple parts and the students can check them off as they do them uh on the in the middle is where the students will actually write their code we're going to focus in this discussion on just the code area up here there are these buttons down here that can be used to as shortcuts for typing but we're going gonna do it old school today and just type in the uh doors by hand then on the right we have the game screen at the top um that's where we'll actually play the game when we press the run button but also where we can design the game by moving around the elements and adding things and things like that at the bottom there are some tabs for controlling different aspects of the game adding new sprites adding widgets sounds and modifying the game um for this for these five lessons exercises we're only going to see uh the sprite tab but later on the course we'll have opportunities to work on the other tabs as well so let's go and get started with um the first exercise um as was mentioned um these elements that make up the game are called sprites uh sprites are basically just a little pictures little characters and objects in the screen that interact um so the background here is not considered a sprite because it doesn't really interact with anything later on we're going to encounter tiles they're not sprites but sprites are the parts of the game that do things so in the simple version of the game we're starting with the sprites are the monkey and banana later on as you saw will add chocolate and a tiger and some other little powerups and things right now just the monkey in the banana the thing to understand about coding games is that when you write code it is always associated with a particular sprite so right now in this exercise and the next ones we're going to be writing code that is attached to the monkey sprite you can see that the editor up here has the monkey showing that that's what we're editing so let's look at what this code uh does or needs to do um so mark talk to you about event handlers event handlers are used for responding to events events are things like pressing a keyboard key clicking a mouse things that happen in in and outside of the games world so here we're creating an event handler for the monkey sprite called own key on key is built into the game builder platform is a special property of a sprite and if the sprite has that property then that code will be executed when a keyboard key is pressed now let's talk about this axle for a second this at symbol is special notation in the coffee script language we're using that says this property its own key is part of the monkey sprite this is the monkey's own key function later on in the course you may have to refer to other sprites inside of the monkey's code and there's different notation for that but for referring to the monkey's own code it's the at symbol so the on key property of the monkey is set equal to and this notation here with the parentheses in the arrow that creates a function and this function takes an argument an input called key which is going to represent the actual keyboard key that is we're not pressed actually going to use that argument in this first exercise we'll use it in the next two so when the keyboard keeps pressed we want to do something what we want to do well if we read the instructions we want to use this function that caught called step one that's going to make the monkey take one step forward again the accidental means this belongs to the monkey who is the monkey that's doing the stepping not the banana or anything else and one step may not seem like much but this code's gonna execute over and over again as long as you hold down the key and so that will move the monkey quickly enough so i've done what they said to do i can check it it's happy i'm gonna press run just to see what happens so here's the one key now if i press any key on my keyboard at all the monkey steps forward as long as i hold the key down and oh happy day he found the banana so we have solved extras of one moving on to exercise two so one of the things we'll see is the exercises build on each other so everything we talked about before is still here with a little bit more because just having the monkey only be able to move forward that's not much of a game we want to have some ability to control what the monkey is doing so now we're actually going to use this input remember i said key is a code that represents the keyboard key that was pressed and so in this line of code they've already given us we're using an if statement to test to see if that key if that keyboard key that was pressed is equal to keyboard.left is a symbol that stands for the left arrow key on the keyboard the double equals is important the double equals is what you should check to see if two things are equal okay if you use just a single equals the program would not work so if the key is the left keyboard key then we're gonna step negative one hmm well this is not too hard to understand since stepping one moves the monkey to the right stepping negative one moves the monkey to the left we want the monkey to be able to move in both directions so let's add the possibility for him to move to the right again so that's going to be f key double equals keyboard right obviously and then we'll use the same thing we used before step one because that moves the monkey to the right and let's check that it's happy with us we'll press run we can see the monkey can move both to the right and to the left and there he managed to make make his way to banana once again all right lesson exercise number three well mark told you that um this is a super mario type game and uh mario's one of mario's biggest tricks is he can jump so we want our monkey to be able to jump so we can get to his been hanging in the air for us so we got our old code from before move to the left or if the keyboard key is the one to the left move backwards if it's the right arrow key move forwards to the right and if it's the up key this isn't right we don't want the up key to move the monkey to the right which is what step one does we want the up key to make the monkey jump so let's change this to this new function jump now notice that this time there's these parentheses empty set of parentheses open print fees and immediately close parentheses right after jump that's because the jump function doesn't take any inputs so the step function takes an input how many steps to take the jump function doesn't and in coffee script if a function doesn't take any inputs you have to use these open and close parentheses right after it but that's all we need to do to modify the code here so we'll check it and we'll run it and then the monkey comes over here and he jumps up and he got the banana all right um these next two exercises are not really based on coding um in addition to the sprites in the game world we can make it more interesting by adding tiles to the game world um to create stair steps and challenges and things for the monkey to move around on to do that nothing in the code window instead we're going to come over here to the game window and use the paintbrush icon and we can choose any of these tiles we like i'll keep using the same one and then just paint some extra tiles on the screen to make it easier for the monkey to get up there to the banana so i've already done that i should be ready to go let's run the game and the monkey should be able to climb up there these new steps and get the banana one more time all right and then one more quick challenge before we finish up with this um in addition to the paint brush there is an eraser tool here so we see there's an obstacle we have all these tiles we can put in the monkey's way so to make this challenge solvable we need to erase these now obviously in designing an actual game you wouldn't add tiles just so you could erase them later but you make mistakes near dividing or putting towels on the screen for the eraser tool is used for removing those so now the monkey has a path we press run and he's got the banana so uh we have gone through those pretty quickly um if you're doing this in the classroom it's probably gonna take your students a little bit longer but if they will read the instructions you see that's pretty much step by step and they should be able to get through uh these exercises almost as quickly as i let you do them but let them take the time to kind of learn and digest the computer science as they're playing so with that i'm going to turn it back over to mark and let him continue the presentation all right thanks again jay um so with the time that we have remaining i want to get to the part uh the meats and potatoes of game creation this is the part that i know many of you are already consider yourself the most popular teacher in your school based on the nature of what you teach uh but if you're not already you for sure will be the most popular teacher once you begin the game builder part of our course so game builder needs to be assigned to your students for them to access it so if you have a question on how to do that just make sure you leave us a comment uh in the chat and then someone will answer that for you all right so let's imagine for a minute you've completed the entire platformer course so what have you actually done what you've done is you started by using the lesson plan video to kind of hype them up and show them what it is that they can make you're showing them the possibilities then through those exercises the ones that jay just walked us through they've learned how to make those games and by this point when they reach game builder they're going to be able to showcase what they've learned and then again combine it with creativity so as our teacher i find that this is a perfect way to assess their progress another reason that you're going to find that this is the ideal next step after coding adventure is for those of you that like to see collaboration and creativity in your classroom then get ready because it's going to go through the roof once you introduce game builder and then honestly if you forget all those other bullet points there just know that your students are going to love game builder because it's just plain and simple a lot of fun so this is a good question when should you assign it and to get the most out of game builder i strongly suggest that you complete at least one of the game creation courses if not more you definitely want to set your students up for success and we believe that this is the best way to ensure that all right so you may be wondering uh where you can find game builder so for those of you that have not accessed it already uh from your teacher homepage you would scroll below your classrooms and then you'll find the platform under in the creativity section and here it is game builder create your own games so you'll start by clicking on create games and then you'll see the green start coding button here so here i see a couple of options or a few options actually for a game template but what i'm going to do is i'm going to choose the default platform because i chose i'm going to choose default because the other five actually have prewritten code in them so it's a small amount but it is there and if i really want to dive in i really want to drive home the assessment aspect of this platform that we have i think it's best to have these students start with a blank slate so let's go ahead and start okay so the first thing i want to do when i get to the game builder is always just take a look at the layout here it's pretty minimal right uh the left side of the screen is going to be divided with our code editor uh taking up the most real estate and then we have some buttons and tabs sitting just below that still on the left side now you can find the stage on the upper right and our design and object tabs in the lower array now staying on the right side of the screen i want to point out something that's a relatively new feature that's going to be so helpful to everybody that's listening today i know the term game changer can be overused but this is like a literal game changer right so here next to my avatar what i have are reference cards now these reference cards will allow students to refer back to the concepts that they've learned in the course and they'll also be able to see example code so i'll actually show you how that looks here so again you know we're saying here's a blank slate but we don't want to leave them out to dry so here are some of your training rules if you will you can also search for uh content in our search bar here with the reference cards and then the last thing i want to point out here on the screen is our save and share buttons you definitely want to make sure that your students are aware of the save button to maintain their progress so those are next to the green run button at the top of the screen um okay so let's see how this process works so right here i'm being asked to add a sprite or widget uh to start the game coding so i'll do just that and i'll keep it simple for the purposes of this webinar we'll just do monkey and we will add a banana as well so two sprites and again um jay went over some really good information but maybe i didn't keep a technology notebook or maybe i didn't write this down what i can do is refer to the reference cards to sort of kickstart uh what it is that i want to do so i remember he said something about an on key and then when i search for it i get the definition as well as an example so i'm actually going to give myself a shortcut copy the example paste it and then again this is a very rudimentary game uh but just to give you an idea how this would look so there it is i kind of i'm i'm on my way here a little bit right okay so i talked about saving and sharing and i do want to walk you guys through the process of sharing a game that you've created i'll click on the share button here so when a student decides to share or create a game they're going to encounter this popup window that has a couple of options so you see i can just make it private you know my game is very early on in the early stages i don't need to share with anybody i could also share it with my classroom and that would be my code monkey classroom so only those 20 to 25 students will be able to see that i can also get a link and that link could be copied and pasted into her browser i could possibly email it to my parents i think some schools have embedded it in their school home page but that's an option as well but also at the bottom here i see the option to publish it so with this i'll go ahead and click on that so i want you guys to keep in mind that any game that's shared will be vetted by us uh to make sure that they meet our community standards so you can sort of see here um sort of the guidelines that the students are going to be held to uh before their game is actually posted online all right so to view the games that have been shared um throughout the cold monkey global community we're going to use the the discover tab uh which is located on the home page so you see it there next to my challenges i'm going to take you there as well backing up a little bit before steven publishes the game you want to make sure they give it a name so we'll call this uh webinar and then the instructions in the description is pretty optional it's optional right now but again getting back to what we talked about assessing uh you can tie in literacy you can tie in the fact that hey it's just comprehension right if i can explain how to do something if i can clearly give directions uh then i i've showed that i have a mastery over this content so in my case i'm just gonna say feed the monkey employ the bad guys and then i click publish okay so we were getting into the discover tab again it's right next to my challenges so here when you get to the discover tab uh you'll see all the games that have made it through that vetting process that i just described and in addition to playing the games as they are so let's just kind of show you a little bit of those so in addition to playing the games as they are you also have the option to remix games which will sort of allow you to add your own slant to the games i also want to point out uh there's sort of a social element to this as well you can see how many times this game has been played you can see how many times people have liked it and we think about the population that we're teaching and those students in those age levels that's kind of you know where they are in their environment these days so that's another great piece that i like to point out all right so as we wrap up today i want to take a look back at the ground that we've covered um we've discussed our game builder package which courses make up that package we explain when to assign it jay walked us through that first lesson of platformer after that we took a look at creating our own games using game builder and then finally we looked at the discover tab to see where to find games that have been published by code monkey users from across the globe all right so i think that that is a great place to stop and open the floor to everyone that's here so with that let's go ahead and begin our q a so we had one question will this webinar be offered again at this time we do not have a scheduled date but we will be sending out the webinar after today's live viewing of it so to make sure that you also have that on hand for any note taking or anything that you need to take as far as that goes thank you leno if you have any other questions all right so if we don't have any other questions i want to thank everybody for their time uh and again like i said uh pdc pd information certificates will be emailed out to you guys as well as a recording thank you everybody and remember to write code catch bananas and save the world we'll see you guys next time thank you
