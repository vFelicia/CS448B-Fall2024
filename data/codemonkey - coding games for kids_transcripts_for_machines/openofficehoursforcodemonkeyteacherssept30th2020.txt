so we do want to let you know um well we'll kind of get into that in a second anyway so thank you guys so much for joining us today um we appreciate you taking the time to share you're joining us from in the chat box as well as what grade levels you teach so welcome to code monkey's third webinar on our for our back to school season uh open hours basically this time is for you to be able to ask us questions so the go the code monkey team wants to thank you so much for joining us for our webinar we know that your time is limited and that everything is just not normal during these times so our goal today is to make sure that you're getting what you need out of today's webinar to help you prepare to teach code monkey with your students the office hour session is really based around the questions we've received from you and we know that teachers who are new and returning teachers to code monkey have some questions just while you get started with the back to school season we also know that they're you're using code monkey differently whether in person or through distance learning or maybe even through those hybrid models so you might be just learning learning looking to learn a little bit more about the platform and how it can work to accommodate all of those situations we also want to give you an opportunity to become more familiarized with the platform that it offers you as a teacher so we'll go over a few of the main features mainly the ones we've been getting those burning questions about and that might be most helpful for you but mostly we want to be able to hear from you so at the end of today's session we will actually give you the ability to um hop on the mic and ask us some live questions we've also taken your questions from your registrations and we hope to answer those as well at the end of today's webinar all right so let's go ahead and get started so today is an open office hours with code monkey you can always follow us on all of our social media platforms we are on twitter linkedin instagram facebook as well as our blog so we'll actually dive a little bit deeper into our blog here today at the end of today's webinar session um today we're gonna be working with um there's three of us here from the team my name is lena soleil and i'm the professional development and sales manager here at codemonkey and i've been with code monkey for about two and a half years now i'll pass it off to my other panelists um hi y'all um this is talia here um happy to be here and help and show you a bit around and answer your questions i'm hoping that questions that we answer um for some of you will also help the others um and also you know if you have more specific questions and if you won't get your answers during this session we'd be happy to continue the conversations with you after so i hope you enjoy hi everyone my name is molly schubach and i am on the sales team here at code monkey been with the company since the beginning of the year but in the industry for about six years so thank you for joining us today as lena and talia said we're excited to have you here and excited to answer all the questions you have great um so today during the webinar you can also tweet at us using the hashtag that you see here at the bottom of the slide cash echo monkey webinar we will do our best to answer any live tweets that we have during today's webinar we're also here to answer your questions so any questions that you have please place them in the q a box we find sometimes in the chat box they tend to get lost so it's easier for us and easier for you if we can get to those questions for you following today's webinar a survey will pop up once you take the survey a professional development certificate will be mailed to you for your time today so if you don't get that just feel free to reach out to us and we'll help you out with that so without any further further ado let's get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world oh i forgot to do this part but okay good i think we're good um okay great so i'll take it from here thanks lina um um as lina said please write your questions in the q a and also um and also we'll have some time at the end for for live questions um so feel free to do that we'll have this is more in a interactive session i'm gonna go ahead and share my screen now okay great if there for any reason you're not being you're not able to see my screen um let me know so i'm actually i'm going to start i want to show you a bit our our newest integration that we have with google classrooms um this would be relevant for what the ones of you who are using google classrooms who already um are many you're managing your rosters there and you're communicating with your students so you can now import your classrooms onto code monkey from google classrooms and i'm just going to log into my account and basically i would need to log in as you see through the google single signon to the google account that i'm also using for my google classroom so you're probably familiar with this uh page this is where you have all your classrooms and um i'm gonna show you how i'm going to create a new classroom so you know we have the regular way of just creating a regular classroom and and then connecting it to the subscription and then adding students to the classroom so i just quickly want to show you this part basically we have three methods for adding students the first two is by creating yourselves the accounts for your students so this might be helpful for the more younger students if you want to create accounts for them give them usernames and passwords and then pass it to them um so these two methods are for that um the third way is by sharing a class code so this is great if you have your students joining from home you might want them joining using their already existing accounts if they have for using google if they're using clever class link we have a few of these integrations so you would share with them the class code and have them join your classroom through that by the way once you've created the accounts for your students we have some nice methods which i call easier access for your students to then log into their accounts basically we have um the login cards and the classroom login url just gonna quickly show you that so once you've already created accounts for your students through the students tab you are able to share with them login cards with your username and password or a classroom login url where they would just um click on their username enter their password and they're in so this skips a few steps of writing the codemonkeyurl and typing in their username they just locate their username enter their password and they're in so this is great way for students to log into their accounts and i'm going to go back to the my classroom page because i actually really want to show you um the the google classroom options so i'll go more into details here just because this is a new integration um but you can actually import from google your classrooms and this is great if you're already using google classrooms or if you use google classrooms to as a way to communicate with your students so we now offer you this option so the first thing that you would need to do is to connect with google classroom basically you would be asked to choose the google account that you're using and basically authorize codemonkey to get the roster from google classroom so you need to allow this because if you won't allow it you won't be able to do the next steps that i'm going to show you now so i've now authorized the authorized code monkey and the next thing i would do is choose which classroom i'm looking to import and these are classrooms i have on my google classrooms okay and those are the ones i can pick from so i'm gonna pick my monday class next thing i'm gonna do is choose to which subscription i want to connect it to i only have one active subscription so that's the default and i'm gonna click on create my classroom and after a few moments the classroom will be imported and added to your classrooms list you can see it right here so a few things about that once i've imported my classroom i've already imported any students that are there so students now can just log into code monkey and we'll show you that part as well and they're already in the classroom can already access the courses if you need to make any changes to your roster you would only do it through google classroom and then you can um update your um roster also on code monkey so i'm gonna go into the classroom now and you can see here also the students as you can see i can't make any changes to the students because as i said these changes will be done in your roster on google classroom but once you make any changes let's say you remove a student or student has been added to the classroom on google classrooms you can always go here you see this same classroom option right here so once you click on that the classroom uncode monkey will be synced according to how you've updated your classroom on google classroom so maybe you've changed the name and you want it to be reflected also on codemonkey you would you would do that through the sync classroom button anytime so that's that's that part another thing i wanted to show you is an option to also add coteachers to your google classroom so you might be already familiar with this feature you can add any colleagues of yours as a coteacher to your classroom that would allow them the same managing abilities over the classroom they can view the progress they can assign courses and they can also access the courses themselves and when it comes to a google classroom you're also able to import teachers but these would only be teachers that are also teachers on your google classrooms on google so let me um let me quickly show you so this is my classroom on on google classroom so this is my monday class and i'm gonna go here to people um just to show you that basically this is this is me this is the user i'm now demoing from beaver achiever and this is my my personal gmail account so this is the code teacher and these are the students which were already added populated onto code monkey so so if i want to add additional teachers i first need to make sure that they are added on google classrooms on the specific classroom and then i can click on import from google and it will basically give me a drop down menu with all the teachers who are the same teachers that i have on google classrooms and then i can click to import the code teacher basically i can then share with my colleague these instructions they would just need to log into codemonkey and they'll already see this classroom under my classrooms um list and they're good to go so that's adding your colleagues last thing i wanted to show you before we move on is the option to assign activities um coding adventure activities from codemonkey so basically we currently don't support um assignments or any google classroom stream functionality which would basically allow any activity that your students do on code monkey to show on google classroom so we currently don't have that but what we do have for the lessons feature for um which is currently available for coding adventure part one part two part three um you can assign specific um activities from the lessons to your classroom so in each of coding adventure lesson plans there is a play time section um so after you do the introduction um and you can assign the challenges to your students each lesson of course it varies which challenges you assign so for example lesson number one you can have the kids start at challenges zero through five with this button here assigned to google classroom i can send an assignment to my classroom to play these challenges and i'm gonna go to my classroom stream to show you how would that look like as you can see i have here a new assignment um i can go to the assignment it shows the challenges and um basically the instructions complete six challenges in coding adventure part one if the student clicks on the link it would lead them directly to these um challenges and also you can edit this here so any additions you want to add to this assignment you would do on google classroom so you can add more instructions add a file uh you might want to give it a due date or you might want to assign it to just specific students so these are all functionalities that are on google classroom so i won't go into that but you can edit your assignments on google classrooms and then if you want the student to market is done that's something that they would do through google classrooms um they have the option on google classrooms to market assignment is done um also they can add links and comments um and so on so that's that's the part i wanted to to show you and um maybe before before we move uh to the next topic um let me also just quickly share the the students side okay so i'm now on the same classroom just viewing the classroom as a student and again i'm going to the classrooms stream and i can see here the assignment click on the assignment i'll access the challenges and i can also now you know after the teacher has imported the classroom on the teacher you can tell your students you can now go ahead log in onto codemonkey using your google account so i'm just gonna click on the google account and choose my the account that i use and this is the account i use in this classroom as a student great and now i've entered my code monkey account i can choose my avatar and i can start playing basically the the just the courses that my teacher has assigned to me um and assigned to to my classroom so just want to show you more of the student side of things and on the student side while talia is on this um as you can see the courses that have been assigned to them are in the upper half of the screen and all of the courses that are not yet available to the students or maybe are haven't been assigned by you are all down below so that's just something to kind of know it's a newer feature that we recently added so that's what your students see right um okay lena do you want to take it from here and maybe give a few updates yes ma'am i'm ready to give us some updates um okay so and then we'll follow up um knit he will follow up with your question too i know molly answered it here in the chat but we'll also follow up with that as well um so one of the updates that we have recently made to the codemonkey platform on the teacher's side of things is how the courses appear for both students and for teachers this this features also will also soon be on the courses when you assign the courses page but we do have a new um i guess system for how the courses are coded and so you'll see here the course they're basically rated in the same way the same scaffolding that we would suggest for students so where they would start from the beginner courses all the way to the more advanced courses so that's how they appear listed here um so we'll see the code monkey junior course we can see that this is a novice course um and it is block based and then when we move on to the beaver achiever course you can see it's also block based as well so each one has their own banner encoding for what level we suggest the courses to be at so for coding adventure you can see this is a beginners based course lena sorry can you can you double check that you're sharing oh sorry yeah i wasn't sure you're right i'm not sharing it all sorry everybody um okay let's start i'll try this again okay so so like i mentioned the courses are basically from beginner to advanced and that's how they're listed here on the screen and you'll have a little it'll tell you which one is blockbased and then which level of coding we suggest for the students to be at in order to to work on this course that doesn't mean that they can't go to a more advanced course you know your students best but this is just how we recently are coding them um so you can see the block based course for the beaver achiever and for the coding adventure and then you can see that we say that the platform of course is more of an intermediate because we do say do coding adventure before um the game design or however you kind of want that to go and then the python courses you can see um the leveling so that's just something to kind of make it easier on your sides we tend to have a lot of questions and then also the students can kind of see you know oh okay this is what level we're kind of working on as well so it's nice for them to have that little bit of extra features so moving along from that new update another update that we actually have as well is our proficiency table so to get to the proficiency table you will go into your classrooms page and then you'll select your classroom so whichever classroom you're kind of working on or working within and then what we'll do is um we will go into the gradebook and so into the gradebook i click on the gradebook tab of my classroom and then up here at the top we can see the gradebook is by course or by proficiency so this is the proficiency table and we'll pull all of your students data and information and so this collects these are the coding concepts that are covered within all of coding within all of code monkey and you can see exactly the level of proficiency of which the students are on so we can see the sequencing and loops we can see that this teacher is in the intermediate category and they are a rock star on variables so we're able to see that a little bit more detail you know which concepts are they may be struggling on for just a little bit more variability in addition to this proficiency tab something else that we recently have is under the teacher resources we just recently launched a new how to video guide on how to get started so we do have that right here for you as well as video tutorials on anything from how to create a classroom and add students to adding students with class codes these are videos if you're very visual this is really great maybe you're not so visual so another place that you can go to is you can click down here in the bottom corner and go to the help center and when you go to the help center you can see that there's a lot of information there is a getting started guide right here for teachers as well it has everything that you might want to have in a textbased format the videos are also attached here as well so you can see like what is the classroom dashboard when i click on it it's going to give me a visual of it and then we'll have some more explanations sometimes there's links to other things it just kind of depends on what you're working on but what i really like most about the help center page is let's say i want to know what concepts are covered in coding adventure so what i do in coding adventure is i type in coding adventure and we can see that in coding venture part one here are all the coding concepts that are listed out so it will also cover what those coding concepts are so what is a simple loop what is a variable what is an array and what is a for loop these are the the concepts that we find are a little bit more challenging for both teachers and students when they're working through these courses and so we wanted to provide some extra support for you so we do have those in there for you as well i regularly visit the help page myself and so um there's just a lot of really great information that is in here like how to turn on super hints what courses should my students begin with so there's just a lot of information you know to kind of refer to as you go um all right so that is most of our updates that we have for you today um talia do you want to go to so now we're oh sorry go ahead no i do we have uh we have a great question here in the q a um lina do you want to take it the yeah sure regarding um what to do when students finish early their assignments yeah so we're just gonna now obviously move on to the q a session of this so um if you have a question that maybe we don't get to um if you just raise your hand it will actually unmute you and you guys can actually ask us yourself so it's nice to hear um you know the live live view of that as well so if you have a question that we don't get to just please feel free to answer that so i'll take this first question here um sometimes my students finish early on their assignments what is your advice for me so um a couple of options for you so within the course itself i would recommend the students working if you're working in the coding adventure course i would highly highly recommend for them to do the skill mode challenges um skill mode basically is a deeper dive into each coding concept and they open up as the students work through the concepts themselves so if they're working on simple loops they'll have access to the simple loops skill mode challenges as they work through so they kind of unlock as they're progressing through because the idea is that they have a deeper they already have an understanding and now they're just going to dive deeper into it and have a little bit more practice so that's one thing i would recommend and just depending on whichever course you're kind of working on let's say you're working on maybe the platformer course now is the time for the students to build and create their own games there's also the ability for students to build and create their own challenges basically when you pull up a challenge why this is locked just because i am in talia's classroom so i'm only able to see what she has assigned to me right now but the challenge builder here is just a freeform platform for the students to basically um there's no better way for a student to show mastery of a concept than for them to build and create it's one thing to work through the platform it's another thing for them to dive deeper into that concept and they can do that by the challenge builder itself or by the so those are just some recommendations that i have for you um as far as that goes so let's go back i want i want to add i want to add also to what to lena's answer regarding the challenge builder that i see many teachers use the the challenge builder you know maybe it's a bit of a different and creative activity so say you have your students going through coding adventures throughout the week i might let them create some challenges on friday just to maybe change it up a bit let them bring it bring it their creativity so i would definitely recommend the challenge builder i agree and i think there's also some different um variability that you can do with that i do i have seen people use it to create stories and to do different you know concepts within other content areas so there's also that as well um so our next question is in what order do you suggest that the students work through the courses so i'm actually going to go to this course page this course kind of map that we have here so i'm kind of depending on the grade level which your student is at so we do have a scope and sequence you feel free to reach out to your sales rep and they can send that over to you as well but let's say my students are in third grade i recommend them starting with coding adventure and then once they get to like after challenge 30 when they really start getting into variables is when i recommend that after each coding concept they complete a challenge like build their own challenge and then after that they would move into the game builder so they need to at least have finished part one of coding adventure to be able to really um i find for them to really unless they have a strong coding foundation they sometimes will struggle a little bit with the coding concepts that are within game builder so so our recommendation is you would do coding adventure then you would go into game builder or if your students are older you might want to start with banana tails and then move into coding into the coding chat box and kind of have that variability so it kind of depends on the level of where your students are at i personally like for all students to do coding code monkey junior just like as a starter i think it's a good warm up to every class period that you're in it's really about computational thinking you're moving the monkey forwards and backwards and you're doing some different directionality purposes with that so i hope that answered that question um okay so our next question was upgrade how does this work and should i use this instead of renaming the classroom talia do you want to answer this question yeah yeah i'd be happy to let let me just quickly share my screen okay just i'm just gonna quickly go over the upgrade it's the upgrade button available in your my classrooms page basically allows you to move over classrooms from one subscription to another and we usually recommend teachers to use this when they are let's say they're renewed they have a new subscription and you want to continue with your classroom you want to continue with the same four students from last year um to your new subscription so instead of creating a new classroom you want them to have their progress so they want you want them to continue with their existing accounts um so you can just move over the classroom to the new subscription by clicking on the upgrade um basically if there are if there's a student that who that you do not uh want to have continue this year so you would first archive them uh but you have all the instructions here but basically um i would just choose which subscription i want to move this classroom to and click the upgrade button i have some information here about the seats quota meaning once i move over the students to the new subscriptions they will take up seats in the new subscription so that's important to pay attention to um and once i've confirmed the upgrade you can see that the classroom now is part of the new subscription and students will be able to access all the content so i would definitely recommend using the upgrade when you're continuing with classrooms instead of creating new classrooms and moving just a student one by one the upgrade is is a good definitely something good to use in these scenarios okay so i'm gonna take over um okay so the next question was how do i know and then we'll get to these two live questions here in just a minute um how do i know which standards could monkey is aligned to so there's a couple of ways in which you can find the standard so one way that you can find the standard is you can go to the teacher resources and pull up the lesson plans that are there and in the lesson plans themselves you can click on any one of the lessons you're able to see the the standards that are addressed if you need specific state standards you can reach out to your sales rep or totally our customer success manager and we can get those reports for you as well something that's a little bit deeper another way is when you go to the code monkey homepage the codemonkey.com page at the very bottom of the page in the footer there is under under curriculum there is a standards page so when you click on the standards page you're actually able to see the standards um for the courses you can also click on a specific course and find the standards there so those are going to be the csta and the iste alignment and then now i'll answer this question here when when can students get their certificates you have access to the certificates at all times here in the classroom resources um so here you're able to get the certificate and you know give them out to your students whenever works best for you um yeah that's great i'll just add i'll just add that um definitely worth looking into these they're cute they have the courses um characters in them they are currently um you know you would need to download them you have you see and you can add the student's name and you can add your signature and date um there's currently no automatic process to generate certificates we've been getting these requests so hopefully with something that we will add in the future but definitely worth checking these out i think students enjoy getting these um sharing with their parents so under the teacher resources check them out yeah sometimes we have teachers ask as well so we'll help write out a certificate for you sometimes my students don't get the concept after finishing a level and they want to do the previous level again can they go back and work again on a previous level so at any time a student can go back at any time um to their course page and all they have to do is click on the challenge map and on the challenge map they can there we always recommend that people go that the students go back and revisit their challenges so you click on the story map up here and at any time the students can go back to any of the previous challenges that they've completed as a teacher you have the ability to move around the students don't so they can always go back their previous solution will always be there but it will help guide them um for okay well what improvement can i make to actually get a three star solution so that's what we would suggest there right and and i'd like to add something um from the teacher's point and lena i'm sharing my screen um i just want to add from the teacher's point so um if you're not familiar with our progress tab please you know get to know this page you have it for each of your classroom and basically this this allows you to really see live how your students are doing you have here the star grading that we use for some of our courses especially coding adventure and this allows you to see it you might go here and check for example and this is challenge 104 you can see that you have a few students who received only two stars um so you can see that this might be a chapter and two loops that students are struggling with so you might wanna go back and review this chapter you can even go and refer to our lesson plans and maybe use the instructions in the lesson plans if you yourself need any guidance or you can also contact us but just wanted to point this out because this is a great tool to use to see where your students are struggling the progress step and you can also go tell you can also go to the gradebook feature and in the great book at the very bottom of the grade book there are circles and the larger the circle the more students that struggle with that specific challenge so it's a really good way for um difficulty and you know basically understanding mini lessons that's what i'm meaning to say with that yeah and and we have here a question um how can students see their own star so basically the students can see their stars um in the course itself so for example i'll share my i'll share my student screen uh okay so this is specifically a student who hasn't made much progress but but basically um once i go to a course i can go through the the story mode map where i can my progress and as i progress i'll get the stars grading right here and i can see how i'm doing basically once i finish and once i solve a challenge i'll immediately get a feedback on my solution i'll get either one star up to three stars if i get only one star i'll get like lena said i'll get some hints on how to help me achieve the second and the third star so that's where the students can see how how they're doing in the course and this is the same if they are on any of the courses that we're working on so they just go to the story map and they'll navigate throughout the story a story map excuse me okay so another question that we had was a teacher that was wondering about variables and how to kind of teach variables so within that there are some different resources um that are available so within i am currently on our code monkey blog page and i just typed in unplugged activities and you can see some blog articles that we've done about unplugged activities and different things like that this is a really good way to find some alternate resources but there is one here specifically um this one has i can look for loops or i can look for variables anything that's kind of linked here will have an unplugged activity and so these are just really good ways the lesson plans have them themselves as well but here is just another example maybe in a little bit more detail about um how to kind of work with the variable with the variable itself so there is an activity here and it kind of walks you through that so some just different ways to you know find some different unplugged coding activities these are activities that um you could do even remote and distant i've seen a lot of teachers you know maybe you're working on the coding adventure course and the kids have like paper arrows that they've made you know like a one arrow and they can kind of move it and maybe there's like a loop where they can show that they're moving you know right or moving left um so there's some different ways to navigate that as well you know having them like which way do we move and solve a challenge or you can screenshot a challenge maybe that you want to do and then have the kids kind of you know maybe in a jam board put the challenge in there and have it as an assessment piece how would you solve this challenge and they can walk it out you know walk walk you through it so just some different ways to kind of utilize that online offline variability and we have this question we have a question here um is this linked to the teacher page so it is handy or do we have to go to the blog to to see it so it you would have to go to the blog itself when you're on the code monkey page it's sell so here i am and i'm logged into the platform i would go to the three lines in the right hand corner and i would click on blog um and then you can just search from there so it's easy to have access to it um but it's not right there underneath the teacher resources but it is located here for you it's a good point um adrian i think i think we are uh we did bring this up that it should be added to the teacher resources um yeah i think it's something that will be added to the teacher resources um um soon so it will be more handy but you can you can still um access it um through the menu like like lena shows and so there's some different just blogs here like offline coding activities you can look for or unplugged game builder just some different tips and hints so just some different things i definitely recommend checking that out and then the question corner as well um part of the blog there's some different questions here as well like drawing your own sprites course so there's some just different resources that you might not have known about before of different ways that you can find it so we have like a dota does math one there's just different places to kind of check and find out a little bit more information is there any competition for students in code monkey um currently we don't have a competition right now that we're doing with students um possibly we'll do when again we did do a challenge builder competition over during covid the initial covet crisis the beginning of the coveted crisis um but it's possible that we'll do something again soon great does anybody wanna ask another question does anybody wanna ask their question live oh yeah um i'm just answering here adrian yeah yeah we will be adding the the feature of the lesson of the blog to the teacher resources there's a question regarding grading we've we've shown a bit the the the gradebook tab lena showed the the new feature which we've recently added the proficiency tab that shows um students um proficiency in coding concepts across courses whereas we have the great book that shows students grade grades within each course the proficiency tab is more across courses taking the top coding concepts and showing how proficient a student is in each coding topic so that's available through the gradebook tab for for each classroom okay and then in the help center as well i'll just share this resource for you as well you can type in how's the grade how are the grades calculated there is a there is a resource here so um it'll tell you exactly how they're scored and then what each star value point is within the gradebook itself if you're ever wondering about that too how can students build their own game so students will i recommend the students working through each one of the courses there are three courses there's a platformer a frogger and a draw your own sprite animation course i recommend the students working through one of the courses and then and then recreating that course and game builder first um and doing that for each one of the courses and you know they can make modifications on you know what it looks like and whatever but it is a freeform platform here um and it pulls up and then the students will create their you know their games that way and they can share them either to our discover page or they can share them to the classroom and then once they do um the other students in the classroom can also play them something that i always like to share about the discover platform itself it is a worldwide sharing platform there are community guidelines here basically the gist of this is that we make sure that there is no inappropriate things in the game itself and making sure that there is no um personal information shared and we just shared a resource about our game builder webinar that we've done as well but anytime you publish a game or a challenge it makes a copy of that challenge essentially and so then if the students try to go in and make a change to it they can't make that change unless they unpublish and republish it will have to go through the approval process through our team okay um i think we'll start wrapping it up unless once we get more questions lina do you want to show the last slide on how to get help going forward great yeah so if you if you have any um questions for us you can feel free to contact us at support codemonkey.com and somebody from the team will get in touch or you can also get in touch directly with um your code monkey club monkey rep besides that we talked about the help center and we shared with you some of the articles but you know just go visit as lena showed it's an easy search you can find a lot of interesting articles um each article has more um it has links to other relevant articles so you might learn new things about the platform and how you can use it um so that's the email that's so sorry that's the url for the help center um yep so if there are no more nobody wants to jump on live and ask us a question um the game builder i'll just take this one last question then we'll wrap it up for today um the game builder and challenge builder do have to be assigned like all other courses i would not assign it until you're ready for the kids to have access to it because if it were me personally just me i would rather tinker around and create my own things and go through the course itself and i know that other students probably feel the same way as me where some people might want to do the course and then do the you know vice versa so i only tend to open things that i'm ready for the students to have access to so i hope i answered that question for you we appreciate every all of your answers that you you know all of your questions that you've asked for today's webinar we know that your time like i mentioned is so valuable especially we know you guys are doing even more work than you know than normal if that's possible but it is um so we just want to thank you guys so much for joining us for today's webinar if you have any questions about anything at all please feel free to reach out to us in the team once again thank you so much and remember to always write code catch bananas and save the world we'll see you guys next time bye
