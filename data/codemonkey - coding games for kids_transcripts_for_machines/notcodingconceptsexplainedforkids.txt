welcome to not my cup of tea let's learn about not not is a boolean operator on a single boolean it is used before a boolean not changes the boolean value so true becomes false and false becomes true here's an example of an if statement so if not banana green so that means if banana is green if banana green turn returns a true then not makes the entire condition false on the other hand if banana green was false then not would make the condition true and the indented code would run in this case it would say banana must be yellow here's a table with some more information again we have the if not banana green and if we just look at the banana green bullion it could either be true or false but the not banana green would be the opposite you're only going to get that true condition when banana green is false because the knot changes it to true let's look at an example here's a challenge where the monkey wants to go and eat some bananas but we got a couple of rotten ones here and i don't think the monkey wants that those ones so um we only want to pick up the ripe ones so if we look at the code we have a for loop so we're going to cycle through all of those bananas and we when we look at each one we're going to say if let's see the code says if b rotten go to b hmm that won't that is that going to make the monkey go to the yellow bananas no it's going to make it go the rotten ones so we need we want the opposite we want if not rotten it's not rotten go to be let's skip over those rotten ones so let's see if this works okay it skipped over them now it's your turn to use not good luck you
