good afternoon and welcome to the first code monkey teaching experience today we are going to learn how to teach code monkey in the classroom to look forward to doing so one of the best parts about our platform is that as a teacher you don't need to have any prior experience coding to be able to teach it to your students the code monkey platform will give you all of the tips and tricks that you need to teach coding seamlessly to your students remember coding is not just for one but for all your first steps with code monkey let's just start off with Who I am my name is Lena Saleh and I'm the professional development manager here at code monkey I am a former stem teacher I taught in the classroom as well as I was the T in stem so basically what that means is I wrote scope and sequence for my district and really developed the coding curriculum and kind of what that looked like from K through 12 I also basically helped teachers with any part of T that they need it if they wanted to make a movie or a stopmotion film or any of those things that's what I helped them do I'm professional development leader and so basically what that means is that I've taught in person and online workshops prior to my experience actually here at code monkey I've taught a couple stem conferences and just some different places around the country I'm also an EdTech Austin organizer so here in Austin meetup groups are really thriving part of the culture here and so I am one of the organizers of EdTech Austin and so that basically means we take the merriment of the EdTech companies there's quite a lot of them here in Austin as well as teachers and we kind of marry the partnership amongst both of them I'm following some of the trends and needs that we see in the community I've been in education for well over a decade even when I was in high school I was going back and working inside of classrooms I would try to do as much tutoring as I could and really just wanted to get as much exposure as I could to education because I always knew from a very young age that I wanted to be a teacher and I wanted to learn as much as I could as fast as I could essentially and something else about me is that I'm just really passionate about computer science I coming from a family that isn't really collegeeducated I didn't really know anything about computer science I thought it was just something that the boys did or I didn't really have much exposure to what was available to me as a career choice or a career pathway and when I left the classroom I walked in and it was a very traditional setting and it was actually kind of sad to me and so I went to a training actually with a co.org I was like oh look at this really cool thing and I fell in love with computer science and ever since then I've just been extremely passionate about it I've taught myself to code back in him both front end as well as my students started surpassing me and I knew I needed to do something different and so that's kind of where my passion came bro all right so here are our objectives for this webinar today and we're gonna learn what CoffeeScript is how to run a lesson in your classroom using code monkey how to work your way through solving code monkey challenges but up to challenge 15 is what our main focus will be of the day what a skill mode why we use it how do we keep track of students work and because this is a prerecorded we're not gonna really do too much on the Q&A part of it but that's just the just an option usually we do with most our webinars what language so let's just start off with first what language to my students code in so if you you should already at this point kind of know what code monkey is but if you don't know code monkey is you program in a language called CoffeeScript and CoffeeScript is a real recognized computer language the golden rule of CoffeeScript is that it's just Java basically what that means is that it's straightforward it's easy to use there's no messy syntax if you've ever done any programming or ever seen it yourself and if you haven't I would recommend kind of maybe just taking a peek in gander at just so you can kind of have an understanding but basically CoffeeScript is the entre so think about like a steak dinner so CoffeeScript is your steak and you don't want to have dinner all by itself just have a steak you usually have potatoes or a side salad or whatever those are all the about are what I would call the syntax so there are things that sir surround the content of the language itself so the challenges that we're going to be looking at today our challenge is zero through four five eleven fourteen and fifteen and that's what we'll stop today so let's just talk about some teaching tips on how to actually teach code monkey and how to really just kind of introduce it to our students so to do so we're gonna need to go into the actual code monkey platform so let's go ahead and get started in and prior to doing so I don't really I'm not going to introduce my students to the platform until I'll kind of discuss what that is later but I'm gonna log in here under my demo account called miss birdie and I just really want the students to have an ease and comfort with the platform and kind of ease in coding with coding before I just set them free inside with the platform because we all know the kids are gonna figure it out but I want them to be able to feel that certain level of success so let's talk about what that looks like so here I am on the code monkey you I'm home page I logged in under my demo account miss birdie and as I scroll down you can see I have some active classrooms we'll talk about what that is we'll also talk about if you have any questions about how to set up your class or homer's where the teacher resources are located and all of that will touch back on that but the nice thing about code monkey is that you have access to all the same courses that your students have access to so what that means is you can code in real time alongside your students this is really great to get you just excited about coding as your students and it's a quick and fun way for you to learn too so the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to click on coding adventure part 1 our courses just recently split into 3 so we have coding adventure part 1 coding adventure part 2 and coding adventure part 3 we change this based on some of the needs of our teachers and just kind of how we were receiving feedback we just felt that it was better manageable in three sections rather than two large courses so here we are I just clicked on coding adventure and as you can see I've already actually completed this course but I'm going to click redo the course if that happens to it at least they redo or begin coding or that we just launched this new narration feature for right now I'm just gonna click out of this I'm going to turn down the sound because the sound can get quite loud I'm gonna leave the sound on just a little bit lower for us all the to get to that control I just clicked on the gears here you can change the game speed I like my game speed to be faster I don't really have the patience necessarily for the slower time so our game speed but a lot of other people do so it's kind of up to you and your preference of what you feel most comfortable so as you can see we're taken here to challenge number 75 and this is pretty challenging so that's not where you'd want to start with your students so the very first thing I start on challenge number zero what I do is I tell students that we're going to begin coding I will actually start by playing this trailer and so it's super cute the kids really like it and it really gives them that buyin into the game and so basically what happens is that gorilla comes over and basically steals monkeys bananas he cries and that's how the game starts like I said super cute and that definitely a thing that you want to go with your students so something about this is that this is our directions I'm just gonna click out of the directions for now and then I'll refer back to how we kind of get there like I said this is a narration tool it will read the text back to you so in case you have students that are struggling readers or maybe learning English or any of that kind of come that that's there for you as well so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to bring my students to wherever your teaching area is even with my 5th graders when I taught 5th grade and this last year I kind of had a space on the floor I wasn't lucky enough to have the primary grades with big carpets but I have used those in years past and so what I do is I bring all the students down and I step away and I put one of my students in the driver's seat and so in this case I really like to bring up a student who usually is a girl she's not she's not a she's not a coding superstar we don't want a coding superstar you don't want a coding superstar and I'm just gonna mute these sounds for right now can leave the narration on for now but basically I don't want to bring up a coding superstar you don't want to bring up a coding superstar because you want the students to know that you believe in them and if you always are bringing up that student that knows everything or knows at all you know that the students start to lose faith in themselves and they think that you don't trust them the same as you trust the student who's a rock star at everything so like I said I'll bring up a girl I'll have her solve the first two to three challenges and I want a girl that the students still trust they still you know they they trust that she will answer the right things but she's not gonna be the strongest person in the class and so I'm just gonna step away and in this case for me it's Jessica Jessica's gonna be in the driver's seat and I'm gonna step back and I'm gonna take an inquiry role I want to take an inquiry role because like I said I want the students to know that if you've ever met a computer programmer themselves they actually go on Sprint's and they're constantly if you her even look at the memes by themselves they'll basically show you that a lot of times the computer programmers don't understand why something works or why it doesn't work and they're constantly failing what I like to call failing forward so it's okay if they make a mistake then nothing happens but we want to know it's basically the failing forward so what do they do with the mistake that happens so anyway Jessica's sitting in the driver's seat and I at this point really for me I don't care if other kids are chiming in but I kind of train my students a little bit that if a student is kind of sharing out their answers I want Jessica in the driver's seat to maybe ask them okay well why do you think that because you know most the students will kind of figure it out and kind of go with the flow but sometimes you have some other students that have some other ways of solving and we kind of want to maybe they have a new way that we never thought about before so Jessica's sitting in the driver's seat and as you can see here monkeys arm is basically saying something and so in this case we say okay she's gonna figure out that she needs to do something because monkey doesn't move on his own and so she clicks run and her a success and so there's a really cool sound and we'll all open up the sound for this next one and I just want you to note that this is a three star solution for how we solved this answer I'll talk a little bit more about what that look like and then Gordo is our little TA he gives little tips and tricks' kind of along the way directions and some encouraging encouraging features right here so now we're going to go on to our next challenge and I like I said Jessica still in the driver's seat I'm gonna have her quickly click out of the directions in this case because I want her to try to figure out okay what to do so like I said I'll just turn on this rather low just so you can kind of hear the sound so she's gonna need to figure out something and maybe she decides she wants to click run like she had done in the last time and she'll see oops and so this will give essentially tips kind of where the students are in the on the editor so we have like I said in the whites part the editor on the right hand side and then we'll see the actual game running on the left hand side text editors look very similar to this where they have something happening on one side and something running on the other sometimes their flip directions but it doesn't really matter so she's gonna say okay yeah he didn't run fast enough and so this is telling us to do something and she might figure out okay the directions told me to step 15 or she might see this ruler and say hey I want to use that and figure out that I need to do some measurement alongside of there so then she clicks that and she feels success in yay and so the stars really just get the students excited as well as these noises they love the noises and that's great we want them to be just as excited about coding as we are so when we go to the next challenge and here is the introduction of the ruler and so if she hasn't used the ruler in the previous challenge she might be seeing that this is demonstrating and so at this point all the kids are getting excited step stepstep we know you need a step and so she'll see here that you can't just step 0 she's gonna need to make a change and so she follows the directions and hopefully all the students are chiming in at this point getting super excited she was gonna say okay we need to step 20 and she's gonna see see kind of what that success looks like I'm gonna reap replay this for you just really quickly so let's say that Jessica didn't change this first one and she decided to type it out and she decided to type it out in this way let's take a look at kind of what happen here so we'll notice this was only a onestar solution and this is a onestar solution because it instead of taking on a much shorter pathway of step 20 which is a three star solution we see that Jessica had to basically span out so it wasn't the shortest most concise way now did she get the banana absolutely but she didn't get it in the shortest way possible and so at this time you could talk about that or we can just kind of keep going to kind of recognize kind of what that looks like and we could resolve this and say okay Jessica we really I really want you to try to get three stars in the solution and then hopefully she can see okay I need to be doing this and feel that sense of success so now Jessica's come up the students are getting pumped about this activity I'm gonna bring up another student and the student is Luis Luis is sorry I meant to click go to the next challenge so if that happens to you just go ahead and you can click three or you can click run again I just kind of type that into the browser and so this time I'm going to bring up Louise and louise has been watching he's been sitting in the audience and the students are also super jazzed and Luis is a non nonnative English speaker he's still kind of truck struggles with reading concepts and that's okay because he can figure this out without needing to be the moat without needing to be the strongest reader in the classroom and so if he needs to he can read out there narration tool for Gordo or for himself and so the student can figure out fully from watching Jessica the last two times you see that he needs to run it oops we are actually doing a debugging here so there's code here but something is wrong with our code and so Luis is going to figure out that he's going to need to change that to bat challenge four and five are very similar they're just turning the other direction and so Gordo tells us I'm you wrote your first code that was longer than one line and so that we move on to the next challenge here and I'm gonna let him continue and here introduces the buttons that type it out for you so the actual step feature and so I'm hoping we hope that Louisa and the class will figure out that they need the hit run first and then figure out okay what is the distance and so in this case we do that and they celebrate and whoohoo we celebrate there and so at this point we've solved challenges zero through four together as a class and we've had some celebration so now we get to challenge number five challenge number five is the first time where students are writing basically more than one line of code but where they're actually seeing an algorithm so let's talk about what an algorithm is and now that we've kind of heard all of our sounds I'm just going to turn this off here just you you know keep it on however so now we saw a challenge it challenges zero through four we saw them together with the class everyone on the carpet basically remember this is an algorithms first time we're seeing an algorithm in challenge number five so let's talk about what is an algorithm an algorithm is a recipe so think about making cookies you have the cookie dough batter and you put the cookies in the oven and although they take delicious before going in the oven they're when they come out there's something entirely different cookies and so they look different than when they came in when they went in then when they came out so that's what we call an input/output so you put something in and you get something out so what I would do at this point is I would show this video to my students about what an algorithm is and hat and have a discussion as a class about what an algorithm is so I found this really great video that I love just an extra resource that I play with my students since I'm going to let you go ahead and listen to this now to do something that you need to show someone you've got your tape they like to do it themselves instructions would go like this rush your team nicely one sex smile it is important it's in the right steps in the right order so as we can see that's when an algorithm is so an algorithm is when you put something in you get something out and at this time usually I'll have the students talk about okay what is your steps for getting ready in the morning and kind of talking about and so now that we've done challenges 0 through 4 together I will release them to do challenge number 5 and solve this challenge so we could definitely solve this challenge together but let's take a look at some of the other resources that are available to us to basically figure out okay how is this happening so I'm going to go back so I'm going to go back to my main teacher dashboard and to do so I can click on the three lines here and click home or I can click on the code monkey icon at any time and so now I'm back here and now I want to go into my classroom so good to get to my active classrooms I click see my classroom if you're not sure how to create a class add your students this is really some really great resources which I'll show you at the end that will help you with all of those things so don't get stressed about it you can also reach out to the code monkey team at any time to help you with any of these options so I click on this birdies class when I clicked on this British class you can see I already have students do you want to know about the print login cards or the classroom URL we're happy to show you that later on as well to bonus clip right along to the progress page the progress page is probably my most favorite when I was teaching but also teachers most favorite we hear that this is probably the best feature of code monkey outside the office of the coding part but this is one of the best teachers teacher tools for you that make your life so much easier so let's talk about why that is so first you see students here are populated in two in here by name you can sort them by name or by progress let's talk about the solutions and let's talk about some of their really cool components here so showed you what a onestar solution is and a onestar solution means that you were able to basically catch all of the bananas a two star solution means you were able to catch all the bananas and use what you learned and a 3 star solution means you were able to solve the challenge using the shortest most concise code possible remember when we had step 0 step 10 step 10 it was a fury wrong way of saying step 20 and so that's why we restart solution with step 20 and a onestar solution was the step 0 step 10 step 10 and sometimes the students will do this nothing wrong with that but there's always encouragement for them to basically grow a little bit okay so now that we know that all of the circle of yellow circles our system of challenges we'll take a look at what that looks like and then anything where you ever see a black line with a explanation inside of it basically means that the student just didn't understand it was not able to pass that on their own so what we see here is along the along the top these I like to call them units but really they're coding concepts the coding concepts match the story mode which we'll kind of talk about that will go back into the coding adventure course here in just a minute and I'll kind of talk a little bit more about that but basically this is each one of these isn't units so the very first ones stepping and turning is basically just an introduction it's exactly what it says they're learning how to step and learning how to turn the most beautiful part about this is that all of these green numbers along the top are your solutions so remember how I said okay let's solve challenge number 5 I can click on number 5 and I could see what the three star solution is so this is great for showcasing this with your students not to mention so I can see the three star solution but not to mention that I can also a students are solving this in real time it's showing me their progress right here in realtime I don't have to do any grading there's nothing that's making extra hard for me because at the end of the day cannot see what all of our students are doing at once oh I'm watching my class size was 25 it was very impossible in a computer lab or even with them sitting with Chromebooks that there does for me to see what every student was doing this is the way that I can then I can see okay this student is struggling now I need to go in conference with him so that's the that's why this is so beautiful the assessment challenges are all like I said listed here in yellow those solutions are here for you as well go mode also reports in the same way another feature that's super awesome here is the limit progress and so so I would get my students logged in and what I would do is I'm going to limit their progress now as you can see after challenge number five is now grayed out that means that once the students get past challenge number five or they cannot go anywhere further beyond that I have limited them I've limited them because I want to know that they're able to master that algorithm before I move on to the rest part of our lessons also the very first lesson colorburst challenges zero through five and so that's just a way to make sure I ensure for myself that my students are in the same pace that I want them to and hopefully we're seeing some success from the students solving zero through four that they're really able to challenge tackle challenge number five solo dough's are they're really awesome parts about the progress bar I always called the progress bar but it's really the progress page and in the progress page like I said it is a teacher's best friend you can also export data if you're not sure how to do that remember we're always here to help you with any of those parts alright let's go back to our main page here and let's kind of get moving so we took a look at what an algorithm was we just talked about what some of the features are in the progress page or progress tab you can access the skill mode and remember it's reported in the same way as the grade book now let's talk about the unplugged activities and then we'll go into what skill mode is so day one I introduce the lesson and I'll let the students we solve it together basically as a class and they solve challenge number five independently day two I open with an unplugged activity so I usually start out with this activity on the board doing something whole group I just feel like usually when you're able to do something for me obviously remember you can take anything that you want from this but these are just some ways that I found that really really work so I will pay something together just to kind of get their brain working a little bit so here on this one I'll showcase this and I showcase it with the grid lines on the back because I really want the students to understand that each square is a step so we use what we learned from yesterday and we talked about or from the previous day or whatever is working with your schedule so how does student a get to the ball so we're going to make sure we use the terms from the day before step turn right and turn left so the very first thing that the students are gonna remember from yesterday is that in order for monkey or the student aid to move they need to face the direction of which they walk so the student will need to turn right first and then if we count these steps it's turn six and then when they get here to the corner they'll need to turn left and then step two complete distance to eight all the while I'm dictating this code on the board or maybe I have student a student write that on the board or sometimes I'll have them depending on my class and their needs I'll have them dictate it on a whiteboard personalized whiteboard or for me I didn't have whiteboards they just wrote right on their desks I also remind them is that it's an algorithm because what do we have to do we had to plan how we got to the end not to mention we wrote we just did easily four lines of code and so the students can now see the correlation between something that's unplugged and plugged in another great unplugged coding example that I love to do with teachers and I love to do with students it's probably my most favorite thing is to do an activity whole group so once again I bring all my students down to the carpet I basically set up two desks or two tables or basically whatever is in your classroom and I put one Bowl on one table and one Bowl on the other and I'll bring up three students want to dictate the code on the board want to be the direction giver and one to be blindfolded so the student before bling' bond funnelled will see that on the table nearest to him there is or her or who whatever student you choose for me when I do it with teachers I fill it with beads it's just easier for me when I travel to conferences but I when I do it with students I usually for me last year my kids were super jazzed about unicorns and so I had a bowl full of unicorn erasers it's just a really good incentive at the end to give them something that they're interested in I've seen teachers use chocolate candy and there's really really there's no there's a rule of what you use so use whatever you think your students will want to have the goal is is that the student is going to take this bowl or cup or whatever it is that you have and they're going to be given directions to go to the other bowl and dump it in and that's how they reached the end so you'll be blindfolded now they've seen where it is and the other student that's the direction giver will need to give really clear directions so we say that before him like if it's going if the student is going to walk two steps and we're going to make sure that prior we set this up that is going to be walking heel to toe so heel to toes as a student is dictating and so what the very first thing that you'll notice even yourself at night I'm traveling in any kind of dark spaces the very first thing you do is you put out your hand this is actually an if statement if something is not there or if something is in the way I'm not going to continue walking and so they'll you'll kind of note that and you can talk about that after as a reflection piece like oh this is really great if statement if something was not there and you can refer back to it in further lessons when the students do get to the if statements actually so the student will be blindfold everyone's gonna be super jazzed wanting to give directions oftentimes depending on my class I'll also have the students in the audience kind of dictating their own code just so that they're also writing the lines of code this too is an algorithm because there's lots of planning involved with getting one person who's blindfolded to the other side using only words so this is a really fun one and a really great way to open up day two now that we've talked about how we start out the lesson let's take a look at what skill mode is and why skill mode is an important feature I'm going to go back to coding adventure part one because remember this is the only part of our focus today remember this is going to take us right to the end but how do we navigate we click on the story map over here or the story icon and it brings us to the story map and so you can scroll quickly by doing the double arrows or squirrel between the worlds or between the concepts here so we start out at the very beginning and so here we see our first steps or stepping and turning now how do you access skill mode and why is skill mode important you access skill mode from the story map and it'll be right here it's also now accessible from the main from the main screen I'll show you that in just a moment but you can really access it here so what is skill mode and why is skill mode important in my opinion and in some of the teachers that I've talked to that have used it and not used it so they've used code monkey for a few years and they've used it the first year they didn't feel like it was very important and then they really realized for the second year so what is skill mode it reinforces what the student needs to know each set of skill mode assumes that the student has already had some depth of understanding so basically it's just a reinforcement of skills and concepts and so or extra practice what I find is that I do support on Fridays and sometimes some other days during the week and what I find is that students who the majority of students who reach out to us are students that have not used utilized skill mode to its fullest potential and what I mean by that is um do you notice what I mean by that is that students are not actually I'm utilizing to its full potential meaning that after they get done with a concept so at the very end of first steps once they get to challenge number ten skill mode will open up for that so this first steps of skill mode so each skill mode is associated to the set of concepts so here the students will actually practice so what does skill mode look like first skill mode is in a black editor more times than not skill mode doesn't have anything written inside of it basically as you can see here we have monkey but we have monkey that we need to do some planning for an algorithm so the need to have taken what they've learned and now apply it skill mode is also really great if you have a student like I have last year my student Brian was super fast at everything he always he would surpass everyone that's just who he was just the nature of him and so he would be if I let him go he'd be on challenge number 75 and I would have Sally and Lucy on challenge number one what I'd even have John and he be I'm challenge number five and we would have students all over I would a lemon his progress in the progress page or progress tab and then I would have him do some extra reinforcement of skills here in skill mode and so this is where the like extra enrichment piece comes in or extra practice and you solve it the same way we've solved all of our other challenges and now we're gonna stop or start talking about objectoriented programming and take a look at our lesson plans so here we are and I'm going to go to challenge number 11 you can shortcut is just type that there and the URL and this says turn we'll make the monkey turn to an object so this is the first time that we see here but in this case the monkey is now not turning 180 degrees or turning left the monkey is actually going to turn directly to the banana we see here that monkey is turning to the banana so we're going to so we can see that the monkey gets to the banana so this will be a 2 star solution remember to get a 3 star solution the student would need to have written step 20 rather than step 10 so now we've seen solution what a blend star solution will look like a 2 star solution and a 3 star solution let's take a look at the lesson plan so we can kind of get an idea so I'm actually just going to open this up in a new tab so I can easily navigate back to it I haven't pretty downloaded lesson plans because I want to show you how to get to them and kind of how that works so here back on the teacher dashboard we click on lesson plans and I'm going to click on the first set of lesson plans because that matches the first course ok when I do so then it will download a pdf version of the lesson plans and so it'll say right here to let you know what lessons are associated and that's going to match the first coding adventure course I would highly recommend reading this first page here just kind of getting used to the lesson plan and then we're going to kind of jump right in so lesson 1 as you can see the lessons are broken up into basically two lessons per unit so stepping and turning will have to turn to and turtle will have to and it will continue going on from there so the very first lesson is just an intro lesson and the second lesson is a deeper dive so let's just take a look at our first lesson right off the bat here and our first lesson the very first thing we'll give you basically in intro into what the lesson is going to be about then I'll tell you objectives and so what I did was I have students I had students have like a tech notebook or like a computer science notebook or whatever it is that you want a name and I had them write out these objectives as student learning objectives so today I will be able to describe and define what coding is and computer programming I will be able to become familiar with the code monkey platform and I'll be able to complete challenges 0 through 5 on code monkey I did this because it was really great way to keep my students accountable as well as when it they weren't they couldn't remember a lot of concept was I can say oh well did you go and check your tech notebook first and so what I do with these components so what the students are actually going to be doing in the lesson step and turn and understand what a challenges and understand what CoffeeScript is is I would take these and I would do word work with them so it's a really great way to integrate my literacy into the lesson and so I would have them talk about what a step is and what a turn is and all we owe you some really great ways on where you can find that all of our lessons are common core line we are working on alignment with some other standards and we are also CTSA c s ta aligned as well so our lessons are broken up into three parts so part one is the introduction part two is the let's go or the play and part three is the reflection piece part one more times than not is going to be our is basically an unplugged activity so something that you're doing when you're not plugged in so in this case this was just introducing them to the lesson so you could use what I did or you can use to what directly comes from the lesson some years of your first time using code monkey you probably rely heavily on these lessons and then kind of go you know kind of skim off from there obviously not everything is a peel and all you use what works for you and what's going to work for your classroom so the let's go is the play and so in this one it told us to play to challenge number five also learn what Gordo was and the instructions the debriefing here will be our the debriefing what did you when you were stuck how do you get three stars what does that matter and then and like I said the second lesson will be a little bit deeper dive in which they're learning how to turn laughs that kind of thing so I really highly recommend for me I printed mine all out and I look at them like I was in a book just because I like to write notes and that kind of thing but obviously you kind of do what works best for you some people are strictly digital and some people kind of go from there on whatever works best for them so now we've taken a look at the lesson plans the second webinar jusino is going to do a little bit deeper dive into the lesson plans that I just wanted to give you a sneak peek so now let's talk about what it means by so we just did the turn two and now we're doing the objectoriented programming so objectoriented programming let's take a look at challenge number fourteen you can navigate between the worlds I just like to quickly navigate our using the story map but I'm just going to do it here we can see here that this is the first time that we're introducing a new object so the object has always been code monkey or our monkey and now we're introducing turtle so what we need to do is we need to get turtle we need to get monkey to get to turtle and turtle to move so that monkey can now get these bananas so the first thing that we would need to do is we need to have him step a certain set of directions something new that you'll learn out here is that I can I can hit an object and it will type it out for me we figure out here that we need to get the monkey to the turtle and the turtle the turtle is stepping ten so the monkey has been on the turtle's back now turtle is our object and now we're orienting him through the program to get to the bananas and so that's what object oriented programming looks as you can see code monkey starts off pretty basic in a sense just really getting the students introduced and it goes into some really indepth concepts and it builds upon it students can't access challenges earlier than they were meant to everything goes in a linear build up all right so now we've taken a look at what objectoriented programming is when we program something other than our monkey in the game we just learned what step was what turning was turning to so instead of monkey turning left and stepping and turning right and stepping he can actually turn now to a specific object also what turtle step is so that's making the turtle step have to associate who the object is and who's stepping because the game automatically assumes the game automatically assumes that monkey is going to be doing all of the movement until we say what we want the object to do take a look at what an assessment challenge looks like all the other challenges that we've looked at have already had some kind of code in them so the students are doing a lot of debugging here it is completely empty meaning that there is no prebuilt code loaded in here why is this important well knowing how your students are doing and where they're having difficulties is of great importance and it also allows you to showcase what the students are understanding and you can share that with parents and any stakeholders and really share it with them and kind of have that celebration of knowledge I allow my students to work collaboratively on the challenges until they get to the assessment challenges because if they're solving an assessment challenge collaboratively I never know what they know this is a chance for me to really understand where the students are and what they're struggling with and then I can check the progress page and I can say oh johnny is struggling I'll show you what a struggling student looks like because we talked about the progress page and I can say okay well this is how this is how they're scoring so I mentioned I forgot to mention the student part you can open this back up by clicking free play so I just went back to the teacher page and clicked on back to the classroom page clicked on the classroom I wanted and clicked on progress I mentioned that you can see all of the three star solutions as a teacher but I forgot to mention that when a student is struggling so let's say on 15 we can see that dodobird didn't score three star solution well why is that so let's click on his star we can see when he attempted the challenge and we can click on his solution and see okay well why was this why was that the case and remember that we want the shortest most concise code and so instead of writing step 15 he wrote step six and step nine so that's the reason why he didn't report back with a three star solution so it's a really great way to have those conversations and remember if you're running short on time or you're not really sure you can always check these solutions they're always available for you so that's how you can tell where a struggling studentís so we talked about what CoffeeScript was remember a real coding language how to run a lesson in your classroom with code monkeys so hopefully you got kind of an understanding of that how to work your way through solving a code monkey challenge up to challenges 15 so we went through all the we went through some challenges to help you get started what skill mode is and why do we use it what a skill mode it's an extra reinforcement of skills or extra practice we use it to reinforce the concepts to really give the students a deeper level of understanding how do we keep track of our students work that's in the progress page so we know where to find solutions what we don't know are where to find the howto videos so I'm going to go back to my homepage here so go back to the teacher dashboard and let's talk about some teacher resources that are available to us all of our lesson plans are located under the lesson plans tab they are broken up coding adventurers broken up to 3 we have dota does math and we have some other lesson plans and things coming soon under the getting started there is this beginner's guide to code monkey and I highly suggest that if you're struggling on a concept check the beginner's guide has about classroom management how to set up your classroom maybe you need to select a different language you have different language learners in your classroom those are really great then these coding concepts remember how I said I did word work or vocabulary work with my students these coding concepts which are accessible right under the getting started are great they have some great vocabulary so you're not going searching for your vocabulary I'm very visual so I prefer to see the visuals and so I like to draw my little Cabul area and write just a couple notes but however it is that you're wanting to go to so what does this step turn left all of our concepts are right here and we have great graphics to go with them as well as text to go to them and students have access to this as well we also have some notes for our code so if you're kind of wanting to do some like hour of code stuff with your students since our code is coming up those are there for you we also have some really great Viette video tutorials how to create a classroom add your students how to share a classroom code these have to start out with a really cute graphic but they're short and almost all of them are under five minutes so they're really quick for you to check out all of our new features are here very often we get questions about what's going on that kind of thing you can click on what the new features are and we'll give you a quick summary of what's basically going on we also have certificates for our students certificates when you can finish coding adventure as well as soon to be our coderush competition our FAQ many teachers ask us questions and many of our users and it check out the howto we have really great really great answers what is coding adventure they're really quick and short answers of course you can always contact us question corner is probably one of the most underutilized so student accounts these are really great because they're conversations usually between Gordo and the teacher kind of understanding what they are they're really great like little context bubbles and then we have just some classroom posters and things that are located under this part here one more thing I wanted to know is these three lines over here is where you can access our blog contact us help looking at some features of your account FAQ is also accessible here as well as home and the my classroom part or accessing your my classroom page so that's where you find all your lesson plans your howto videos we went over how to find your solution thank you so much for joining us this evening I know that your time is precious and I hope you found some value today remember to contact us if you have any questions also follow us on twitter at code monkey st you and hashtag code monkey webinar if you want some to give us some feedback on today also follow us on Instagram remember to write code catch bananas and save the world thank you so much for joining us today have a wonderful day
