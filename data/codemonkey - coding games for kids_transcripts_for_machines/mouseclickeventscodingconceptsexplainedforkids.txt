welcome to click me let's learn about mouse click events clicking on your left mouse button on an object creates an event each object has an on click function that is called whenever you click on the object you can code the onclick function to do specific actions here here's an example of an on click function for the object monkey so because you would have this function in your code whenever you would click on the monkey it would make the monkey step three so when you write your on click functions just make sure you have the object name dot on click and then you could specify the actions you want to happen whenever you click on that object let's look at an example here's a challenge where we're going to use the on click function to make the monkey move our monkey object and also our turtle object in order to get our banana object so let's see we have the on click function already here for our monkey whenever we click on the monkey make the monkey step three so now let's add one for the turtle turtle that's our object and we have the on click function for it and we're going to tell the turtle to step let's say 5. now when i run this you're going to see a little finger like a little like it's clicking a little finger that's about to click appear above these objects just to tell you really quickly that the on click function is attached to it see it okay now i can click on the turtle and it's stepping five and then i'll click on the monkey and it's stepping three each time there we go here's a challenge with three bananas and we want to have an on click function for each banana so one quick way to do that is i could have a for loop so for b in bananas i'm going to have an on click function for each of those bananas so i use b and then within that function i'm telling it for the monkey i'm telling the monkey to go to that banana so whatever banana i click on the monkey will go to that banana and then i also want to have a crocodile on click function what do we want the crocodile to do in this challenge probably turn so the monkey can get on get to the banana so we could say crocodile turn left okay now go ahead and run this now note that we do not have a on click function for the monkey so when i run it if i click on the monkey really nothing happens except it the monkey claps so it all but i can click on the crocodile okay now the if i click on the banana the monkey should go to that banana okay go to this banana what do i need to do next okay i'll turn the crocodile and then i'll click on this banana all right now it's your turn to use mouse click events good luck
