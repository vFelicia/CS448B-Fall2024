welcome to who moved my mouse let's learn about mouse move events mouse events occur when you move or click your mouse for the next few challenges we're focusing on the events that occur when you move your mouse the function on mouse move is automatically called when you move your mouse and in the function you can code what should happen as a result so here's an example we have the on mouse move function and it has the parameter pause and you could see we're using the pause within the function so we are telling the monkey to turn to that position to wherever your mouse cursor is the monkey should turn to it the parameter pause holds the position of your mouse cursor so when you move the mouse pause is changed it's automatically updated as you move your mouse cursor you can access the x and y coordinates like separately access those coordinates of your cursor by using pause.x and pause.y let's look at a challenge here's a challenge with the monkey a crocodile and three bananas the code has two functions in it the on mouse move function which is called whenever you move your mouse and it has the parameter pause and the on key function which is called whenever you press a key on your keyboard it has the parameter key and in this case we're having the monkey step one so we're having the monkey step one when any key is pressed so how are we going to use the on mouse move function to complete this challenge so if we look at the challenge we need that crocodile to turn towards the monkey and maybe towards other things later so maybe we can use the position of your cursor to turn the crocodile so let's try that crocodile turn two the parameter pause so if we run this we could see look at that the crocodile's following my cursor so i can line it up with the monkey and now i'm pressing any key to get the monkey to move and there we go here's an example with the monkey a bat and three bananas we have the function on mouse move and the parameter pause within we have the bat dot set x this means we're setting the x position of the bat to the x position of your cursor pause dot x and we're setting the y position of the bat to 100 then our on key function which has the parameter key is checking to see if the key is g that you pressed and if so have the bat grab what underneath it okay so let's just run this as is okay when we run this we could see the bats moving in the x position following my mouse but if i move my mouse in the y position the bat's not moving it's staying at that 100 because that's what we have in the code so let's change that let's change the 100 to be pause dot y so the y position of the bat tracks the y position of your cursor so let's go ahead and run it and now the bat is right underneath my cursor so now i can bring it to the banana press g bring it over to the monkey so grab and bring it to the monkey nice now it's your turn to use mouse move events good luck you
