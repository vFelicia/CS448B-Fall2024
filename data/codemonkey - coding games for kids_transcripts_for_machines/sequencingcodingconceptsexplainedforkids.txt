hello welcome to code monkey's coding adventure the first topic we're going to learn about is sequencing sequencing is when you put things in a certain order for example days of the week are in a certain sequence first comes monday then tuesday then wednesday and so on actually real life runs in sequences you probably have a plan for getting up each morning maybe it's that you get out of bed then you take a shower you put on your clothes you brush your teeth have breakfast that's the sequence that you run through each morning well code follows a sequence also also and that's line one line two line three it always runs in that order so what that means is that when you plan your code you got to think of not just the commands but also the order of those commands or the order of the actions let's take a look at an example here's an example where we want the monkey to get the three bananas to get to that first banana we know the monkey is going to need to step 15. now you could look at the monkey and see where it's facing and it looks like the monkey's going to need to turn also so we know we're going to have a step and we know we're going to have a turn but what order should we put those in let's try if we would have put step 15 and then turn left we know those commands are right ah but it looks like the order isn't it's because code runs from the top of the program to the bottom it's going to step 15 before turning left we want to do the opposite so i'm going to take this and put it below just ah that looks right and now we just need to do that same sort of thinking to get to the second and last banana so now that we've gone over sequencing it's your turn good luck
