what I like about the text aspects they present a different view going to the kids and I want them to see that since it's more in line with what they will experience if they pursue it down the road and if that's gonna be the case then it's great to get up in elementary school when the enthusiasm is like you know the rings aren't too really too much knowledge yet so they're government to grow and I like the fact that you've had a very comprehensive curriculum because that was a good backbone for me to have to lean on I didn't stick to it all the time agile percent but it gave me a framework to follow which I use and I like the form of activities were helpful of some of them I headed home several times where I understood it because I am NOT my training motor but this was something new and fresh and different but um it was universally really liked by everybody all the kids and every grade level really loves modular format it's very engaging because it has a game like quality to it it's got a sense of humor which is great because method used in writing into everything in life especially when you teach you can walk in here and than breathing and clicking of a mouse I want them to have the capability the understanding of basic basic skills that they typically do a code monkey doing code.org doing the things that will allow them to create something that is original whether it's a game or an animation or whatever it is that they or a short story whatever it is that they can create it as I want them to have a sense of of ownership of something that's original content because you know the challenges are wonderful for developing the skills and all of these programs some of the end goal is to have them be created as a partner and not just consumers of content so my job is really to Knight interest and get them involved so that then they can take it run
