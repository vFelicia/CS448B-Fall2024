the coderush competition is such a cool way to engage the students in coding so I would totally encourage you to sign up at the collage competition when it starts because my students were so excited to code it so I started to use code monkey towards the end of last winter the beginning of spring so we started the competition with two teams I didn't think I would have two teams to enter I really like the different challenges that code monkey awkard I felt that it was very basic at the beginning and the kids were able to build on the skills that they learned as they went through the competition and it was fun like to see what everybody's up to and to catch up the kids loved different challenges they thought that they were amazing they could not wait until different levels opened up in the competition each week and some kids as soon as they got home from school they would spend hours on money like someone else said even a cup of coding master might have trouble on it and that's ok because that is natural they helped each other not just within the team but they helped the other team as well I was very proud of all of these kids oh we were ecstatic we were excited we had such a sensational April 2017 you know because there was this leaderboard and you guys used to update it very frequently like every morning you used to sit and stare all the parents were involved in this coverage and they were all excited and you know our April was sensational
