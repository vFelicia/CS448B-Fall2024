welcome to if it snows let's learn about if if statements run commands only if a condition is met it's very similar how you normally use if for example you might say if it's raining i'll bring an umbrella here's how you write the if statement if space condition so if the condition is met meaning it's true the indented commands will run if the condition is not true or is not met we're going to skip all the commands that are indented and will run the first command outside of the if for example if near pile near pile is the condition so if that condition is true we will drop if the condition is not true when the computer reaches the if then it will skip to the line outside of the if statement let's look at a challenge so here's a challenge where we have the monkey the goat and the banana now the goat you can see in the if statement if the banana is frozen we want the goat to go to the banana and then hit it and then for the monkey the monkey could say yum but the monkey could just let's say go to the banana okay so if the banana is frozen we want the goat to do these things but if the banana is not frozen we should just skip to go to banana so this allows this this program will be successful when the banana's frozen but also when the banana is not frozen okay let's go ahead and run it okay we skipped straight to the go to banana because the banana was not frozen let's look at another example here's an interesting challenge where we have some bananas that are frozen and some that aren't and the goat needs to decide whether it needs to go to a banana because it's frozen or it doesn't need to go the monkey could just go directly to the banana so we have this code where we're going through a for loop so we're going to go and work on one banana at a time if that given banana's frozen what do we want to do let's see so if the banana's frozen we want the goat to go to that banana so we're going to say b whatever banana we're currently working on in the loop and then we want the goat to basically hit that banana and then um and then basically we want monkey to go to the banana the bee so the great thing about this is if the banana is not frozen it's just gonna skip to go to b but if the banana is frozen it'll have the goat go to b and then hit it and then we'll still have the monkey go to the b so let's see how this works okay so we're gonna go to the all right and then okay now the monkey can just go directly okay the goat knows it needs to hit it and then the monkey goes to it and then the last one monkey could just directly go to it now it's your turn to use if good luck
