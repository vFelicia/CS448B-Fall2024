alrighty thank you all so much for joining us for today's webinar we're gonna go ahead and get started um so today is our quarterly office hour sessions the code monkey team as always wants to thank you so much for joining us for today's webinar session our goal today is to make sure that you are covered for teaching code monkey with your students and updated on any of the new changes that we have made and so that is the purpose of today's office hours this office hour session as with every one of our quarterly office hour session is based around the questions that we receive from you our teachers as well as any questions that we'll get from you throughout today's webinar we want you to know that this session is for both new and returning code monkey teachers and we know that some of you have been using code monkey this year with your students either distance learning or hybrid or combination of both or everywhere in between this year is definitely daily changes um so we want to um just go over a few of our main features mainly the ones that we're getting a lot of questions about update you about new ones and then any questions that you have if you pop them in the q a box you can also chat along the side it's easier for us to check your track your questions inside of the q a box here all right so today's oops office hours so you can also follow us on twitter facebook instagram at our handle which is codemonkeyst you can also follow us on linkedin and then check out our blog for any kinds of updates or anything like that so during today's webinar you can tweet at us using the hashtag codemonkeywebinar as you can see down on the right hand side of our slides for today's webinar we will do our best to answer any live tweets during our webinar today and we weren't able to get to you we'll follow up directly after today's webinar and that also proceeds with any questions that have been unasked so now without further ado we're going to introduce the oops introduce the team for us so i'll go ahead and get started my name is lena salle i'm the professional development and sales manager here at code monkey and i'll go ahead and let talia introduce herself hi everyone i'm talia head of customer success and always excited always exciting uh to have this office hours and and see some familiar names here and some new names so i hope you enjoy thank you hi everybody my name is molly schubach and i am on the sales team i am also going to be here helping out with a q a question so thank you all for joining us today oops excuse me great we always like you to know who's with you on today's webinar so that's always an important component um so i just want to reiterate that we're here to answer any questions that you have so you can chat with us along in the chat box or you can also ask us any questions in the q a at any s any point in time i'm following today's webinar directly after today's webinar a survey will pop up and after that survey pops up you'll get a professional development certificate that will be mailed to you so without further ado let's get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world so our objectives that we'll be covering today are classroom and student access adding coteachers limiting progress lesson features great book and proficiency report and then we'll leave time quite a bit of time for you for q a as well as updating you on some of our new features and launches that we have upcoming we always have all of our webinars available to you you can go to codemonkey.com backslash webinars they're always there for you as well as on our youtube channel so we do like to keep those up to date for you to access at any time all right oh not yet not yet with that slide sorry it's a surprise all right anyway okay the first look before the first look exactly okay so uh hi everyone let me share my screen i'm gonna continue from here with a short short demo of the different features that are available i'm just making sure lena can you see my screen the login screen yes i can okay great so i'm just gonna log into one of my my accounts i'm gonna use the google single signon um sorry for this this is hebrew um but um basically i'm just gonna choose my codemonkey account and and the reason i'm using um my google account is uh i wanna show you actually also how to import google classrooms so for that purpose i need to um log in using my google account the one i use for my google classrooms um and i have also my google classrooms ready right here um and uh i already have a few classrooms here i have i have an active subscription with available seats but basically the first thing you would do on codemonkey is to create your classroom um you can either create just a new classroom right here just a regular classroom and then you would need to add your students um or you can import a google classroom with your students already in it so that sort of saves you time of having to add your students later on but let's let's talk about the different methods for adding students before i show you the way to import a google classroom so actually i'm going to go to the new classroom i've just created just to review the the three available methods and i can add students through the students tab right here by clicking on add students i see the three methods so the first two are relevant when you're looking to create your students accounts so you would give them a username and a password which you can then share with them um and then they can just log into codemonkey using their um username and password and they're already in the classroom so this is this is handy especially for those younger students and you want to create their accounts for them so you can do that or for students who don't have any google accounts for example so they don't use any single signons so you would create usernames for them the third method is having your students join using the class code so so that's that's handy especially when you have students joining from home um and uh you would just provide them with the classroom code um so either students joining from home or this is what you would use in case your students are using any um single signon methods we have um google clever class link so students are able to use these accounts which is great because you don't want to have them remem remember another username and another password so just let them use the single signon option um and you can just share with them this classroom code it's a it's a code it's a unique code that each classroom uh would have and um and then they would um be able to join using the class code um and they would enter your classroom with the code i'll i can show that later on if we'll have time another another nice way is by providing them this unique link which already has the code so this would be less steps for your students they wouldn't have to enter the code themselves so i definitely recommend checking out this and using the link and sharing them the link instead if you're able to share a link if you're communicating online um you can send this so that's the class code method i'm going to go back to the my classrooms page because i want to show also the option to import a google classroom which is very handy i'm sure many of you use google classrooms you already have your students group together and this will definitely make your life easier and your students wouldn't have to join using the class code because once you import the classroom the students would already be imported with it just one thing the first time you sign into codemonk using your google account you will be asked to provide to authorize codemonkey to view your google classrooms so you will have here a message and you'll just have to authorize that and then you'll be able to go on and import classrooms so i'm going to import my monday classroom i'm going to have it connected to my subscription and okay let's click on create my classroom so i'm just going to wait for monkey to import my classroom and i i have this confirmation that classroom imported import has been completed and you can see my monday class has been added with three students already in my classroom let me just click on the classroom so i can see let's go to the students tab this is my classroom dashboard where i can perform different actions on the classroom and see see my students and indeed these are my students um you can see them right here so they've already been populated another thing i want to show you regarding google classroom is that you can at any point make any changes to your students or even to the classroom name once you do that on google classroom you can just sync your classroom on codemonkey to have the changes reflected on code monkey as well so any changes to your students if you're going to add any additional students you would do that on your google classroom and then you can sync the classroom on code monkey and have the change is reflected okay okay let me now show you just the student side because we we don't always show that but i know it's it's important so i'm going to share a new screen um just our home page and and i'm going to logging is a student who is in that google classroom so this is something that you would need to um direct your your students to do we also have a a great help article a student guide for students who are in a google classroom so this would guide them for the steps that they need to do but basically once they access the login page all they would need to do is click on the google button um in order to and then they would need to choose their google account um and once they do that they are in their codemonkey account they can choose their avatar and um they can see here the classroom names and basically they have the courses here available to them again according to what you as the teacher has assigned have assigned to them uh but that's it's just a few steps and once they're in they can already access the the courses so that's the student side of things okay i'm going uh back to um the my classrooms page another thing i want to show you you might have other teachers working with you on the same classroom also and you would also need to provide them with access to the classroom so you can add them as coteachers so as long as you have these teachers also added as teachers on your google classroom so you see i have i've added myself also as a teacher on google classroom but here from code monkey i would need to import the the teacher and then i can add them as a coteacher to this classroom so once they log into their account they'll also be able to see this classroom um to perform all the actions um and as you can see i've been added so so that's the that's the first thing that you would do let's see and on this student list just really quickly i like to note that you can see that this student has this username here so that's just important so you can see that they logged in correctly right okay lina you want to take it from here that was so quick i felt like i blinked my eyes no just kidding um okay so we'll go ahead and um now it's my turn to begin sharing so um we have recently so when talia just shared her screen about the student guides and how you know the student screen looks like we did recently add the tiling also of these basically what the course is and what level they are to the courses page so how i got here is on my classrooms page you can see all of my classrooms are listed here and i just clicked into a classroom when i clicked into the classroom it brings you right to the teacher behind the scenes dashboard here it brings me right into the progress page i'm going to come back to this progress page but i want to talk about the courses and so in the course page i just clicked on it here on the top we have these new improvements that we made here so we're able to see all of the courses that we have here and then when you click on the specific course you can click read more and here you're able to see a quick synopsis summary of what the course is going to be covering what it's about what specific coding concepts there are you can click here and see the specific standards that are associated with the lesson plan these are csta standards here and then you can find the specific lesson plans for that specific course you just click on a few lesson plans and it's right there and once it's assigned to the students then they'll be able to see it on their side we've had a lot of questions specifically around i've signed all i've assigned all three courses to my students in the bieber achiever and so beaver achiever coding adventure and banana tales are a suite of courses that means that students have to work linearly through those through those courses in order for the next course to unlock so that's just something to keep in mind a question that we've we've gotten a few times and then here on this course page specifically as well you can see the grade levels i've been asked this do the students see this they don't they only see um this tiling and the name this specific banner here that tells you the course and the specific language that's attached to it and then the course name itself you can see which device it's best for so web or a tablet so web is just you know right through the web and if it's available on a tablet device or if it works well once it's been assigned to the student you see that it's has a yellow banner that says hey this has been assigned and if it hasn't then you'll see this green button here for the for the students something else that we added new here is you can easily navigate now between all of your courses you don't have to go back out to the classrooms page but you can do that right over here on the side you can quickly navigate between all of your classrooms and then you have that ability to see those as well okay so now let's go back to the progress page and let's just discuss this progress page here so limiting progress is a pretty important um feature for a lot of teachers just depending on how you're kind of running your classroom so as you can see here i have this classroom specifically limited to only challenge 20. what that means is that the students will submit the challenge for challenge 20 but they won't be able to go on to challenge 21 they will be able to see all of the previous challenges up until that point and then also able to see the skill mode challenges skill mode challenges are just specific reinforced concepts based on the concept reinforced challenges based on the concepts that they've learned so specific to stepping and turning specific to the turtle and turning to them and they're sport in the exact same way you're also able to see the solutions here as well you can sort by progress the same way that you can in story mode as well so those are there for them for them to have some extra practice and reinforcement you can also in this same thing do it free play that means it opens up completely for the students or you can do it limited based on the last lesson taught so if you are using lesson mode this is an important feature i've seen a lot of teachers say oh the kiddos have been able to fly past the specific challenges within the lesson if you don't have this on here that says limit based on the last lesson taught then the students will be able to continue to progress once you end the lesson mode so that's just something that we like for you to keep in mind when you're working through those challenges or assigning them to the students themselves okay um and i'll i'll i'll talk a bit about um lessons about the lessons uh feature um i'll share my screen again okay yeah um okay so the lessons feature uh you might already um some of you might might be using this but but this is a really great helpful feature that will help you run your coding classes even when you have students accessing from home it's currently only available for coding adventure course and this is great to use when you are using our lesson plans so basically under the teacher resources you can find lesson plans for all of our courses and for coding adventure as well of course but through the lesson feature you can access the individual lesson plans so here we are on lesson number one so we also have here access to just the individual lesson plan let's just open that up and we have here the the lesson plans with the different parts we have the introduction play time um we were finishing up always with the debriefing so that's our our lesson plan available for you and uh so if you can see this page is structured according to the to the lesson plan and uh it also gives you access to the different challenges and other um great files here that you might want to open up once when you are teaching this lesson so this is a great way to conduct your lesson it has it all structured here and you can just use it this way or you can go a bit further and use our lesson mode so the lesson mode is this button right here so you know how you're explaining something for your students but they're already on code monkey and they're clicking on things and they want to access things so once you use the lesson mode you click on begin lesson and basically it will lock your students from all of the activities until you assign the challenges so i'm going to confirm and let's also see how the students would see this so this is the student account i'm just going to refresh and you would see that the student is now locked everything here is closed and waiting for the the teacher so now you really have your students with you focusing and um you can start with the um with the introduction and then only once you are ready for your students to start playing you can click on the assign challenges and then your students once they refresh their page they can access these uh these challenges until you end the play time and now you want to go into the debrief and talk about what what we've learned in these challenges and uh once you're done with your lesson you can end the lesson and the great thing about this it marks your lesson here in green so you know that you've completed this lesson so once you're back uh meeting with this classroom you're all you you know it kind of saves um it keeps track of of what you uh what lesson you last taught so you can continue to the next lesson another little thing i wanted to add here this is relevant for when you're using google classroom this is currently um an option that we have to assign challenges to your google classroom from codemonkey so once you click on this it will let's see how it would look like in the classroom stream so as you can see i posted an assignment to my classroom the post has a link a link to these challenges and um i can also as the teacher i can also choose to edit it i can add more instructions i might want to assign it to diff specific students i want i might want to give it a due date um or i can add different things so that's available for for you through google classroom but i just wanted to show you um that connectivity that you have and of course once your students have completed they can on their end they can complete this as done um i will add that this won't show on um it won't show here you would see that on your google classroom so this is the lessons feature currently only available for coding adventure um and i really recommend using this this is super handy especially in remote and especially when you are running a very structured lesson another thing that i'll just note on here too is if you have students who are maybe a little bit further behind you when you assign those challenges to them within the lesson it does um have them bypass the challenges where they were so this is a way to kind of keep all of your students together as well so whether you use the lesson note in that way or you just assign it to the students it kind of is a way to keep everyone on the same page okay so moving right along here we are now in the gradebook tab of everything here and so in the gradebook i just clicked on this proficiency table just something we like to note this is all of the concepts that are covered throughout all of the courses within code monkey so you can see we have sequencing all the way to modules and import sorts input output i'm just the different variances of coding concepts that the students will encounter throughout coding throughout code monkey here we can see that a we have very novice to advance so the more that they are introduced in working through those concepts the more advanced they become in the concepts themselves so some teachers like to use it to see oh okay they worked on a couple of different courses now i know that they need some remediation or some extra reinforcements to kind of help enhance those skills that they might be struggling on or they might be super advanced some just just different variations um so then we also have our just the typical gradebook here you can change it based on numbers letters and percentages you can also average it between um you know whichever concepts it is that you're working on within that course all accessible fully from all of the for all of the courses that we have here you're able to see how many students completed this specific course since the dota's math is a shorter course you're also able to see if you're working through platformer you're able to see this pass fail for students you can see i have a couple of struggle bolsters here you can see how many exercises they've reached how many bonuses that the students have solved so the average on the bonuses here and then how many students have actually completed the course so i really like to use this because i really like the statistics that are here at the bottom um just for some you know extra places to look you can also export this into a csv file something like that as well before we get into the first look i just like to make mention of something i was speaking with a teacher the other day and she wanted to kind of keep track and see she was running a little mini coding competition with her students and so she was looking for ways to be able to track the data she had 70 classrooms and she didn't want to check the data for every single classroom so when you export all of this data from all of your classrooms to a csv file it will put them all organized by each classroom name and you're able to see the ranking of the students so just something i like to note as well for you there too great um lena can you share your screen with the with the slide please well just uh something uh we we wanted to give you a first look of a feature that will we will release soon um this is uh it's it it's it might have it's a small addition but it might have a big impact uh we've been getting requests from from teachers about this um teachers looking to see more information per student you have your students now either in class or from home um so it's really not the same it's really hard to see what are they actually doing how much are they how much time are they spending on codemonkey so um so from the progress tab which lena showed before once you have all the students there and once you would click on a student so this is our new student activity dashboard and this is um it's not the final it's not the final look it's not the final design but we really wanted to show you already what to expect coming real soon and this will give you much more insight into your students progress how much time have they spent on code monkey in the last few days you can see the course progress at the bottom so this is a great way if you want to look into a specific student um he might be a student that is struggling um or you might want to you might you might be communicating with their parent so this is one place where you can see information about this student you can navigate between the courses and see their progress within the courses or you can see some nice stats at the top right how many games they've created how many challenges they've created um if how many activities have they started maybe they're only on just one activity so maybe they're a bit behind and then you have the proficiency report for this specific student again showing how proficient they are in the different coding concepts across all the courses they've already started and of course you can see when they last logged on so so this is uh not the final design but this is some this is going to be um these are the this is the information that that will be available um and we're looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this your feedback on this you know i'll say again this is um all uh thanks to to feedback we've received from um our users so we're really excited we're really excited to to release this i hope you are as well and um i think i think that's it unless you have any questions regarding this specifically or we can also move on to some questions we've already received um in the um registration form so we a few of you already sent us some questions uh we'd like to answer um and be just before we get to this q a part just a couple of things i wanted to also just reinforce and just kind of remind you of in the teacher resource section is where all of the lesson plans are located um something that we have seen a lot of questions coming in is um we do have this teaching with coding adventure course here it's me if you haven't gotten tired of me but it will kind of introduce you to a few of the concepts well it will introduce you to the concepts that are covered in part one of coding adventure which are also concepts you see in other places in other courses so if you're looking for something to just kind of reinforce that piece maybe something you're not sure about too well yourself this is a really great way to see that in a more visual way in addition to that you can always see the you know the webinars at any other time the howto guides nothing too much has changed there the solutions just a reminder they're here and on the progress page as well and then um in the help center so you can locate the help center on the left hand corner we do always have any of the resources that we shared with you today are pretty much located here on the help page so we have the student login guides there is a getting started for teachers we do have a video guide here um how to create classrooms we also have something as well that we just recently added here and that is um coding adventure so we do have the coding concepts and terminology located here it does have the specific concepts that are covered an animated image that's here it shows you what it looks like as well as just basically a walkthrough of those concepts for coding adventure and then we do also have this getting started with coding adventure and so this walks students through basically the components of coding adventure with from gordo all the way through the story map so this is just a good introduction that you can utilize with your students when introducing this course especially virtually this will really help you know with that or it's just fun for them to listen sometimes to others than just ourselves right so just wanted to share that component with you so you kind of knew that as well another question that had come up this week was being able to remix something in discover um and so this is just something to to to note here in in your classrooms page itself when you go to the showroom that's where all the students games and challenges are showcased when you if you don't have the discover enabled you're not able to make a you're not able to remix the games the students actually won't even see the discover tab themselves so that's just something um that has been kind of brought to our attention a couple of times just some wonderings about why they can't see it and so if they can't see it it's just because the enable discover hasn't been there and why would you utilize the discover this is really good for working through an engineering design process remixing games maybe changing some modifications and you know even working through some pseudocoding itself would be some really good ways to use the discover as well okay so it's quite quiet for questions but now we would like to hear your questions see any wonderings that you have anything you would like us to touch base on we really want this to be a time to honor your time as well we know that your questions are very valuable and we really we very much value your feedback or wonderings or any of that so i will move to some questions that came from our q a as well so a question was how do we delete email addresses and don't have an account against your number of users so when you're importing through google classroom as you've noticed it will just automatically take the seats up so if you're having an issue if you feel like something has not been correct or there's been an issue you can just email us at support codemonkey.com and we'll be sure to take care of that for you another question here was when can we give the certificates how many levels do students need to complete so we do have certificates for all of the courses i definitely recommend giving the certificates to students after they've completed a course but obviously it's totally up to you okay so this is a great question here we have i'm new joining i'm new to joining code monkey and i have some questions one is well i need to create a new classroom for every session so for the students that you've had in your classrooms it is best to create a classroom for every session so whether you're importing that from google classroom you're sharing a class code with them i'm just something to note is when you do archive your students let's say you don't want to see all the the classrooms active within the classrooms page when you archive them here basically the students data is still there the student's data doesn't doesn't disappear i know we get a lot of questions about that too what if i what if i archive them and they come and see me again for the next semester sometimes that happens um as long as they become active again and they keep the same username password same login information their data is stays the same for the lifetime of their account so their progress saves all of that kind of thing um would a classroom purchase now extended to the next academic year um pete that's a great question that's something that would be best to reach out to your sales rep or um to ask that question depending on the length of your subscription but a way to to see where your subscription and how long it's been active if you can't remember is here i'm on the my classrooms page when you click on view all you're able to see the name of your subscription and then when your subscription starts and ends so that's just a good way to check that out as well okay i'm just looking for some questions here for you okay i'm gonna get that get back to that okay so upgrading how does this work should i use this instead of renaming a classroom so here on my classrooms page you're able to see the upgrade button here basically upgrade just means applying a new subscription so let's say your subscription has expired now when you upgrade it that's just means that you're upgrading either from your free trial to your paid subscription or um you know reapplying your classroom to the old to the new subscription so that's just a way basically to say hey i want my new subscription attached to my classroom so should i should i show it on my screen because i have one expired classroom sure i can quickly show this so so this is uh as lena said so if if you have so you have a new subscription with code monkey but you want your classroom to continue or you might have used our trial and then uh purchased a subscription and now you want to move the the classroom from your trial to your new subscription show there's no need to create a new classroom and create new student accounts um you can just upgrade using this button and upgrade basically means moving a classroom between subscriptions so you'll you'll have a few popup messages here just asking you to review if you are actually looking to have all the students um upgraded with the classroom if not you can first archive them so they won't move don't move over to the new classroom but then you can continue just choose the subscription you want to upgrade the classroom to and click on upgrade and then as you can see the classroom is now part of the new subscription so that's the upgrade button great um another question here we have or just a comment from one of our teachers is for students logging in this teacher alan he's uh he is here in texas located with myself as well but he created a google slide that has the app links to it and then he just uses the login url and then the students all they have to do is find their name and click on the password so that's great for the younger students that is that classroom login url that you can share so there's a lot of a lot of ways to you know kind of make that a little bit easier another question is here i have nineyearold kids which course is best suited to start with so it's just really going to depend on the exposure that your students have had to coding prior to that sometimes if i have kiddos that are around that age range it might be best to start them with beaver achiever just to get them excited about it sometimes the switch from block based to tech space can be a bit challenging although nine years old is about the sweet spot for getting them into coding adventure but sometimes just to kind of get them hyped about coding itself and really ready for that next step sometimes the beaver achiever can be a good starting point i also think it's a very fun course so it's it's really good for anyone to kind of check out and then um molly our panelists also shared with you you can always go to codemonkey.com courses or in our help center we do have some good articles regarding that as well um for just some kind of help there another question here that we got from our questions for registration was how best to teach functions and variables so a good question about questions and you know how to teach functions and variables i definitely recommend when you're teaching variables to use the skill mode challenges and have your students practice those skill mode challenges um something i'm not sure um when you started using codemonkey or or that but let me show you a couple of components about the variables itself so we recently added something to the variables page and the variables challenges here and so i'll just go right into one of the variables themselves so i recommend that the students work on these variables here and then work on those variable challenges but let's say i go to challenge 46. i have to remember which challenge is the best one to showcase to you so here we see i'll just kind of talk through this really really quickly so basically what we see here is obviously the stage on the left the script and text editor on the right hand side and here we see a variable so variable is a container it contains an inform it contains a value and the value here that we have is 5. y is the value of 5 here well we can see that we can either pick up the ruler and measure the distance or in this number line here it actually tells us what the distance is oh i'm sorry i realized i wasn't sharing that's my fault good good point here okay so i'm on challenge 46 on coding adventure and so i'll just kind of walk through this really quickly so we have the monkey here and we have some values on the number lines and here we see that d is container and the d is the container value for five we set it as five because we know that's how much he needs to move and then um we'll see that he also is then next gonna need to move a distance of five so what do we do so we know that the very first step that this monkey is going to take is going to be that value of five then we set it to turn right like anything else and then what we have here is a variable statement so basically what do we want it to increase well we know that five plus five is ten so we want it to actually increase by a difference of five so what we'll see here and then we'll run it so when it gets to the statement it's adding the value it's either adding it's like an additive pattern or it's a subtraction so it's it's taking it's either adding or taking away and so here we're going to add a value of 5 and that means that the new container will be 10. so i want you to pay attention here at the bottom basically where the buttons are and you're able to see this so here we can see the value is five and then when we got to that variable statement the value changed to ten and so that's just a really good way to kind of show that a little bit more so about the variables and then practicing those variables when you get to those skill mode challenges i also recommend checking out those coding concepts that i had mentioned um there either checking out the variables here or checking that out from the help center article um and then with functions i'll just briefly go to a function that i know is a tricky part so these so there are functions here this is more complex functions here um so i'll just kind of talk through what we see here so instead of having the monkey we have a rat and the rat has to collect matches and then the rat has to take the match back to the pile so we basically set the function we're basically naming this function it could be anything here i just named it go to and we have a placeholder the placeholder is a it doesn't have any value at all all we're saying is that every time we write go to we want it to turn to whatever object we've determined and then step the distance to that specific object so here we can see that we want it to every time we run go to so what it's going to do it's going to turn to the bridge and step the distance to the bridge then it's going to turn to the match and step the distance to the match and then it's going to grab it and drop it so we're going to see that it's going to be a short code but you'll also see it's running here what is a representing it represented the match and it represented the bridge now there was an extra step i needed to go to the pile but we can see it here a is the bridge a is the match then it's the bridge and then it's going to the pile so a is just kind of a placeholder so we added this new um you know functions box descriptions box to kind of help with that so just some things i recommend um with that so i think there were not any more questions here let me just check our q a here is there a way to see more difficult coding classes in the free trial to see how much more complex it will become um billy i think it would be best to get in contact with our sales team so you can contact sales codemonkey.com and we can kind of help you with that and just depending on you know kind of what things you're looking at and just want to make sure that we're able to meet your needs in the best way possible all right so um i just wanted to mention i'm just going to do one more screen share here we are going to be doing our first ever twitter chat march 23rd at 6 p.m central and that's going to be led by our teacher ambassadors paige and javier and they're going to be discussing synchronous and asynchronous coding so if you're available we hope you can join us during that time if not share chat with other people hopefully they'll also be um just as excited as we are about this twitter chat that we'll be hosting and it's our very first one so it's pretty exciting um okay so if you need
