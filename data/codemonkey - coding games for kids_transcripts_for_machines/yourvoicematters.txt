Cod monkey was established in 2014 with the goal of creating developmentally appropriate and engaging curriculum for teaching students how to code the new features that are developed and released are primarily based on the feedback from our customers we're checking in with them throughout the school year asking what's working what can be better and that's how we determine where we're going to make improvements or where we are going to add new things whether it's tools on the platform or new courses
