I realized I was paused so let me go back here how to make steam how to make coding equitable and create soon engagement during the code with 19 pandemic and then you can follow us on our social media channels and our code our code monkey ambassadors today are going to share a little bit about their blocks that they've created I like to start off with just introducing myself my name is Lena Saleh and I'm the sales and professional development manager here at code monkey you can follow me on Twitter or you can email me at any time at Lena s code monkey comm I like um a former classroom teacher and obviously all of this remote learning and thing has also affected us all as well so we hope we can provide you some value during today's webinar and if you have any questions please put them in the chat box or the Q&A and we will get to your questions the best that we can during today's webinar we don't answer your question we'll make sure to follow up with any anything left untouched so now I'm going to present my great team that is with me here today and that is our code monkey teacher ambassadors all right so we're going to go ahead with Paige hi my name is Paige bestoff and from New Jersey and I've been teaching computer science for approximately 20 years I'm currently teaching digital technology and the gifted and talented program for grades two through five where our concentration is encoding robotics steam before becoming a teacher I worked in the nonprofit field tracking employment trends and my area of expertise and what I stress is getting students ready for careers what's better than we were reading this thank you so much Paige for joining us and and developing this webinar today Michelle I am a Michelle ward and I'm a prek through eighth grade keyboard computer apps computer science teacher code monkey teacher ambassador I am a CST a member and I'm also presenting at st 20 it was the summer but it's been moved to November I am a 23year veteran teacher taught eighteen years at the high school five of those years the high school has advanced computers to a little bit everything desktop publishing interactive multimedia presentation web design one and two proficient and the Adobe design suite as well as HTML and JavaScript I was also 13 years high school teacher with the math everything from prealgebra all the way up to algebra 2 and technical geometry I am a certified digital designer I also taught accounting 201 and 202 as an adjunct professor as you can see I'm a furrier student and a stop TopCoder my area expertise is Microsoft 365 and I'm also a certified Microsoft innovative educator awesome thank you so much Michelle all right Xavier Priya chamomile sorry good morning everyone my name is javi real are in a bilingual teacher and his is for war Montessori Academy we are a Montessori School to supplicate the 5th graders and I truly believe er if my committee my commitment as an educator is to provide a good coating applications to my students so I am proud ambassador for Osmo also Osteen I've cam in my schools and Lego master educator as a geek person I really love Legos is a for the creativity and handson so I really love Legos and also a bit sports ambassador it's another company to provide his JavaScript examples and also I'm proud to be a code monkey ambassador and to presenting in different F camps this is my sixth year in this school where no computer science for all so when I present in these these to my administration say you're crazy these kids they can learn in a coding they they don't know how to type I don't have to say it let's do it because they have fundamentals for co.org so my my goal is up a father or to curse to empower more girls and to have everybody at the same opportunity to learn computer science so like I said and I'm a lingual teacher do you have any questions in Spanish I'm here to help you guys thank you awesome thank you so much Javier before we get started I just want to let you know that this webinar was entirely created by our teacher ambassadors so they have put lots of hard work blood sweat and tears into today's presentation so feel free to ask them any questions and they're happy to be here along the way so without further ado go ahead and get started hi so today's activities are going to include talking about student engagement collaboration equity amongst your students some unplugged activities and talking about skills and incentives to get your students engaged next okay so I'm gonna start out talking about how to engage your students during distance learning next hey go back on please oh oops did I mess up the order here okay oh this is the right way oops sorry this one right or no nope you're too far ahead too far something's missing oh I did go too far I'm so sorry you guys that's okay alright yeah okay next okay here we go all right so once a week I just taught I see my students in person so now that we're doing distance learning weekly I post a teacher video talking about what the activity for the week is going to be giving them their instructions and right now I'm using flipgrid but you can use seesaw some other applications and then once my students watch me in my video with the directions they go on to code monkey they work on their lessons and then I have them come back into the application and they talk about how they've solved the puzzles so here are some students who were screenshots so you can see how my students post their puzzles next okay so next we're going to talk about how to foster this collaboration so it's really next so it's really important to me that my students see me and they have a connection with me as well as them seeing each other again we're all on distance social distancing so we really want them to feel that they're part of a community so what I've done is if my students have cell phone but they do not have any devices at home I have them use some kind of video application FaceTime Skype Google hangout zoom and I have them do what's called paired programming so pair programming is when two people work on a coding activity together using only one device so when I'm in my classroom as you can see there's a picture of my two students they're using one device and they working collaboratively together but since there cannot be together what we do is they do some kind of video chat and I know a lot of families did that over the holidays last week and very popular to do a zoom or house party with your family members so I have them do the same type of thing one student will use the device they'll show the device on their screen to their peer and they'll work together on the puzzles even if students have their own devices they can still work over the phone together I remember as a high school student talking with my friends on the phone working together on different assignments so this way you always have somebody to work with you okay next okay so I post my assignments in Google classroom but if any of the learning management systems will do and what I do is I'll post the assignment and my students will comment on each other's work so this way again they have some kind of connection if a student is stuck on a puzzle and not sure what then what they should be working on they don't know what to do I don't have to be the only one to help them I currently have 407 students so it's very difficult for me to reach each and every one of them and a lot of them will have the same question on the same puzzle so I allow my students to post comments and ask questions while they are in Google classroom and also if a student found a puzzle particularly challenging and they know that their classmates are going to need some help I have them record themselves teaching how to do that and again that brings us all closer together I also use a program called tarot deck but you could also use on air pod buncee and puzzle there are a couple of other different companies that you can use and what I do is I have a synchronous lessons for my students so I create in Google slides using a pear deck of addition and they go through the slides individually at their own pace and they can learn Unplugged coding activities okay next okay so a lot of students again I mentioned before do not have devices I have many students who do not have access to any devices but I want to make sure that they're still learning coding I want to make sure that things are equitable so my next slide so what I do is I can give them paper and pencil activities so for students who do not have access to any devices at home they can build an obstacle course using pillows toys stuffed animals household items and they can write the code to teach their family members how to actually get through this obstacle course I have a lot of students who are siblings so I hope that they are working well they are working together some of them and working through the puzzles and creating different courses for themselves if they have access to a phone maybe a parents phone they can take a picture of it and then they can upload that to Google classroom and for evidence of learning those families where the parents are busy because they are working and the students do not have anybody at home to interact with I have them do the same thing they'll build the obstacle course and then they can post the picture in Google classroom and then their friends and peers can then do the coding activity and also post their responses in Google classroom okay we also um look okay so we also have different coding vocabulary the first one I have listed here is algorithms so algorithms is a list of steps that students that you would follow for everyday activities so I can have students write out a list of different algorithms another vocabulary word is loops and that's something that repeats over and over again so you can have your students write out a list of things that loop so for example if you want them to brush their hair you tell them brush your hair from top to bottom brush your hair from top to bottom brush your hair from over and over again instead you can say just brush your hair from top to bottom ten times and the last activity I have listed here is functions so a function is something that you don't need to give directions for for example make a sandwich so you would teach somebody how to make that peanut butter and sandwich cookie nut butter and jelly sandwich that first time and then you don't have to tell them again those individual steps you can just say as a function make a sandwich whether you're new to coding or not you do not have to be the expert make sure that you are you are facilitating and teaching your students how to become the expert so whether I'm in person or distance learning I make sure that my students are the ones who are teaching each other how to do the puzzles and if your students have trouble and they're not sure how to do the puzzles please remember that code monkey has the teacher solutions there for you you do not have to be the expert there's no way that you're going to be able to learn how to do every puzzle possible okay next if you're interested in finding out more about coding computer science or anything that I teach you can follow me on Twitter Facebook check my website and read my blog post thank you thank you so much Paige Michelle are you are you there I am I forgot I forgot to thank me I had my finger on another yacht that's okay I am Michelle ward and I am presenting the unclogged activity section I have so much stuff and if you want to see all the stuff there are several links in this presentation and I think we are going to be sending this presentation to all of you go ahead and do the next slide for me Lena next now why is it important that we have unplugged activities because some of our students do not have any devices or no compatible devices slow internet we are facing several cities that were ravaged by the tornadoes that have nothing going on right now and whenever things do get back together they still may not have internet capabilities so this might be something that teachers could provide for those students computer downtime I am addicted to technology and I know several our students are also and this is a great way to kind of get their head out of the computer I'm big on handson learning kinesthetic learning it's just how I taught as a math teacher I was a crazy kooky teacher that everyone loves to talk about but my kids really did learn and sometimes it's nice to have some fun family activities something to bring the family together you never know the kid may actually be able to teach their mom and dad something cool about computer science next please I'm gonna walk through I'm gonna try to do three of these and these were just three of kind of my favorite ones and I like to pull in a lot of maths because I taught maths for a long time and I also like to pull in some music because that's just something different who puts computer science and music together I do and I went also going to have one that deals with exercise just trying to get us up and motivated so this first one is a product code check digits and I taught this lesson 20 years ago with zip codes and there's no prerequisite for it but if you want to go through the modulo lesson that helps and I'll talk about the modular lesson later and if you have any type an item it has a product code on it write UPC code bar code whatever you want to call it and on that code you have different numbers and what I did I pulled the numbers off of this code the first step is you're going to write your numbers out but you're going to alternate you're going to have the odd position ones first and the evil one position second so if you look at this number the very far lefthand corner there's a six so that's where that six came from and then the next number is a three that's where this number came from and you're going to alternate going all the way across now the bar code the numbers are actually embedded within those loans and that's something totally different also but you get to the end of it notice I didn't write the last number the last number is two that is your check digit and it's gonna come into play the last step trust me we'll get there it's gonna be a little bit of math but I know you guys are smart you can do it so first step you're going to add up that first row of numbers that was in green so I'm going to add those together I want to add all those together we get 17 now we're going to continue and we're gonna use the digit from the ones column the last digit so if you're really trying to focus on the math you'll focus on the ones digit if you just want them to get it quick to say okay you're going to grab hope that last digit which is a seven and it's going to come into play here in a moment your next step is to add up your second row of numbers now you notice that this Row is one less number than the previous line so you're going to add all those numbers together and when you add all those numbers together we get 27 now this example they gave us you actually have the same number for the last digit now I didn't come up with this example it came off of CS unplugged it's a little bit of a coincidence you might want to try something where it's not all the same digit so well that last number again the seven your next step you always multiply by three you're going to take the seven that you got from the last number in step two and you multiply it by three and you're going to get 21 you're going to take the last digit of that 21 which is a 1 then what you're going to do from your step 3 you're going to take that 7 now unplugged CS unplugged I got their colors wrong this one is pink this number here should be pink this one is yellow this number should be Yoho I noticed that but I figured you guys be able to follow along so I multiplied 3 times 7 from step 2 the last numbers study and step 2 then I'm going to add from step 3 that's 7 that we had the last digit to the last digit in step 4 which is 1 and that gives us 8 you know with me that's the worst of the maths so now where does that checksum come in so you're gonna ask yourself look there's some algebra what plus 8 is equal to 10 well we know the answer is 2 and lo and behold look and see what that check digit is next slide so what does that mean or do you need some major help there is a video and it's a really good quality video that I've got linked to this presentation from CS unplugged and the teacher goes through this also I think she's Australian but she you can understand her very well now what does this do what why do we have a check digit or a check doing the checksum you know whenever you scan your product and it goes across there and sometimes it doesn't read right you hear this beep you know they'll look at it like I'm gonna run it through the again beep and if something is damaged to this if it's bent or damaged or like that paint can had something on it then they've got to do what manually enter in those lovely numbers and you know they're gonna kind of look at you like oh you had to pick the one thing like that it's a lot in those numbers so they'll put those numbers in now if they get the numbers incorrectly it'll ring upright that this was some ink for my printer but if they put it in wrong it might ring up that's a doorknob so when you put numbers in wrong you have four different kinds of errors and this is where I can actually tie it into accounting your felt four main types of errors you have if the internet and a digit value has changed that's called a transcription error because they put in the wrong value to the adjacent digits are swapped you how about what I call a dyslexic moment that's a transposition error a digit is inserted in the number that's something that's not even there that's called a commissioned error or a digit is removed from the number that means one is omitted so that is an omission now there is one thing that you can do with transposition errors if you're running your your code and it doesn't quite work out right if you take the number let's say it's supposed to been 56 but you entered 65 if you take those two numbers and subtract you always will get what none so anytime you have a transposition error if it's off by 9 then you know somewhere you had a moment where you swapped your numbers next please now this next one is the Fitness one there are two they've gone on this slide but we're gonna focus on that last one that's called fitness unplugged all right next please so on the fitness unplug one I really like this one it's a whole family or if you have lots of kids it's a way to get kids together you need at least three members to be working on this so the first thing that you're gonna do as a family you're going to brainstorm some different fitness exercises it could be running on the spot running in place star jumps which is some strange looking jumping jack ski jump through you're jumping from the side to the side or you could be catching beanbags so that's the first thing is kind of brainstorming and collaborate then you're going to work together and draw on each of the cards now it doesn't have to be anything fancy it could just be whatever you've got around the house and you're going to write these on the cards you're gonna have a go or a start card for the start of the program now put mine in green because green is go and then you got four cards each with a different exercise on it so I did the running play star jump ski jumps and they catch the bean bag then you got to figure out how you're going to finish you get to choose strike a pose sit with your arms crossed or stand as straight as you can next slide then I go through all this detail a big discussion on what you need to do on steps three to six all you're really doing is placing your cards figuring out what they mean and discussing mainly if you have an exercise that maybe someone doesn't understand what are you supposed to do for that particular exercise that's to be a good place to discuss that way you are talking the same programming language now they talked about placing whiteboards I don't know about you I don't have any whiteboards at home so what you could do is just use a piece of paper that works just fine for a whiteboard or if it's nice you can take it outside and draw some squares with chalk on your driveway or in the middle the road you can put your cards down if you're outside you want to actually put something on it so I'd put a rocker or whatever you got to keep it in place and you need a hula hoop if you don't have a hula hoop you can use a jump rope something that you could make into a decent sized circle that would have two of your cards inside of it if you see in my graphic you see what that might be about of course you're not really telling anyone what what does that hula hoop do next slide so what comes next we get to use a little bit of computer lingo you got to set the parameters and a parameter all it does is tell us how long to do something how many times to do something so we know go but how many store jumps are we supposed to do how many ski jumps are we supposed to do to catch the beanbag but not how many and then should we repeat the ski jumps and catch a beanbag but not how many times oh that's what the hula hoop is for it's a loop you got to make sure that you choose reasonable numbers you don't want to do a hundred of anything orient unless you're just that it so you've got to make sure that if you're letting your kids decide this that they use a reasonable number alright next slide now you're going to write in the number of times X each exercise should be done and for the exercises in the hula hoop you need to repeat both of them how many times well in this example you see the three that's in the chord that's above the hula hoop so that is how many times you're going to go through the loop or how many iterations that you have and I snuck in a little bit of computer jargon do you have to use computer jargon no but you can if you know it just a big good time to kind of introduce it and then you would kind of discuss okay so if we repeat it three times we'd have 10 ski jumps and then five times you catch the beanbag and then you do that two more times next slide please then it's a fun part it's time to test it so I really didn't say about the jobs that each person could have you have a programmer and you have a tester so the programmer is going to watch to see if everyone is doing it correctly and the tester is going to be looking for any numbers to change or if the activities need more instructions when the tester says go you're going to start following your fitness app the programmer is going to ask the tester if he or she saw anything that could be changed or improved you can so discuss any computer lingo that you know at this point or you can just kind of just say okay we did it and we created our own program we were discussing our own programming language all right next slide now we get to put computer science and some music together using the modulo operator now I'm not sure how many of you know about the modulo operator it sounds foreboding but it's not all it is is that something has a circular reference next slide so what I'm talking about circular reference the months of the year are modulo 12 because we have four months after November is coming March 13 months after January is February and so on it's circular right same thing where the clock it is also going to be circular music so if you name the music notes the musical notes is modulo 7 if you start at note D that's in green on a piano and you count up seven white notes or white keys you'll end back up on D which is the same note but it's an octave higher and this raises an interesting fact that there are seven different notes an octave is it what is opt mean 8 hmm a mistake let's count it this way so you're going to count the start and the end so if I count the start d e f g a b c d 8 high octave so now if you get there are actually 12 different notes in Oktay because you have sharps and flats the Black Keys and you will have 12 semitones that's what they all call it we call them half steps when I was in music theory and so if you start at D and you go up to an octave higher D it's a total of 12 different notes on the piano just like the 12 months in the calendar here next so the cyclic number relationship comes up when playing notes and computer programs which often use a digital representation of piano notes called MIDI so I'm going to try to wrap this up very quickly in a system middle c is note number sixty C sharp is 61 and D is 62 so an octave above D which is 62 you'd add 12 and that would put you at 70 for every twelfth number corresponds to the same note name now I've got a little bit of a challenge for you I put a little bit of MIDI music in the middle of this so I'm going off the chart the X is going to be a quarter rest if it is in parenthesis that's a whole note the red pipes is the end of a measure so I gave you a little bit of code we're gonna do this in 4/4 time anyone think they know what that is you need a hint see if I can do this without messing up even recognize that miss a last note that would be like Beethoven's fifth symphony next slide if you need to get in touch with me I've got some articles on code monkey blog how to explain algorithms to kids programming for six to twelve year olds I am on twitter at shelley thirteen ward you can join me on facebook at code monkey superfans or you can visit my class website Ward's wise walks at weebly.com thank you thank you so much Michelle hi how to use coal monkey or Corinne to incentive students and providing skills for the future it looks a huge topic but I really want to share with you my experience with my students so next so how do I incorporate con monkey nowhere Elementary School I begin with code monkey jr. before it was only available in tablet seven notes and iPads however right now is available for any device so I'm really happy for do that because any of my students from kinder I teach them how to use the mouse in this case right now the finger for the iPads and also the mouse so I believe so it's important to provide that kind of experience to in earlier stages for my students so I believe exposing the kids to computers early has if faker raising awareness for kids a struggles of technology and gives them the first experience or troubleshooting and sometimes they're frustrated because they don't so hard to use in it but I give you that confidence and I use some of my students they already mastered this tooth out there is a struggle so I already promoting then some kind of leadership skills and also teamwork another skills are really doing with my kids is critical thinking sometimes I ask them so I'm here to help you but I'm not here to answer the question so to give you the answer please before to ask me at your elbow partner to looking for the solution I'll he do it of course I ask my students don't give you the correct answer I give you some clues because really students they may need to think in little by themselves because I mention it all the time when you already in that taste or something is gonna be only yourself so you need to answer it questions for that so promoting critical thinking problemsolving war and creativity is one of my steps for that for my students so next so I know there ray resourcing code monkey is the beaver achiever that is awesome product because my students start thinking it's very easy but it's really the blocking and drop they are practicing already previously from Kota Oros crash they they see the character in this case the beaver moving out put it all the date drops and the woods and everything is fun for them and they finish happy for to that we do this last year with the our code and really enjoy it so thank you for to talk with my students and it's an incentive for them because I see the happiness when they said mr. Aguilar I did challenge number 17 I can have two stars Ryan I have three stars so it's exciting for me when I see the exciting for them as well to inside winwin teacherstudent so next so for my upper graders third to fifth graders they already know a little more demanding with them because sighs I very sometimes struggle as a teacher they see my 5th graders is still typing with one finger I think so it's for every old teachers they struggle died in elementary middle school in high schools because I don't blame it everything you can do it is with ice telephone you can use one finger with a tablet you use one finger but at the same time I ask the students the real world recorded you have at least 35 to 60 words per minute to type in so you want to move into be a programmer you need to be a good type in so i reinforce them to say to know what let's go continue practicing because syntax errors in Korean is very critical because you are gonna be debugging and incorporated a little turn for them to start family residing with their turn for algorithm ugh in box and everything so I try to create that confidence for my students so next so like I mention it I started doing my students first oh well I'm so sorry I used Dom towards Matt for four and three traders because my colleagues in my school the same is regular do you can help us with something for my students because they struggle in math and said you know what I have a great product for do that so when they're coming to my class as a special class I saw my students twice I awake for 45 to an hour I put it this one they say let's go to Matt so dough mats they give you the challenge to start with a subtraction addition and they made some angles so it students practicing a little bit and my my colleagues they said okay they're labeled for proficiency in that there little by little is is better so thank you for to do that and say I don't do a lot because the students do by themselves by imagery train I hate to help you you need to find the answer so they struggle a little bit of course aside Kato I give you some clues and they found the correct answer with a practicing with the dome at and also another product after that is the banana tells because they use JavaScript I'm sorry use Python so for that it's a little more challenge for my students barrel they doing with great success for that next so like I mention it with my students I start for the blocky coat and I move upon blocky this crash is crushed junior iMovie to coda org fundamentals all the course photo mentals and I adapted the curriculum for coda or computer scientist cover it is the target audience for middle school sixth to eighth graders but I adapted for my fifth graders of course with the permission for coda or to do that so I attended a conference with a coded or for how to incorporate as a computer science discovery to my students like I said I always looking for opportunities to my students to exposure them to say you know what these opportunities for you or computer science you need to learn because when you're gonna be in middle school and high school you're gonna be see more about this so moving from scratch 2.0 because some of my students they want to continue practice calm but I don't have internet so one of the solution is to have the scratch 2.0 saving and a pin drive and then putting on one of the computers for the parents and they take it at home and I give you an assignment had to do it at home step by step with a scratch 2.0 of course the 3.0 version you can save it in I USB Drive but uh Elise is the same concept if they already mastered a 2.0 it's gonna be easy to try to move it to 3.0 after that I can have been looking for options for to start doing the webbased transcript a Corinne life for example right now called monkey they use that one bits voice is another great tool that use in it because they give you like thing lines of code but of course my students sometimes we'd have a little syntax errors they forgot to close the parenthesis or they forget to put the comma the semi color or to have the difference between the square bracket a corny bracket so I mentioned today and that's very important to you understand when you're typing and recognize all the characters and your keyboard you don't be confusing when you put a different or to the wrong a bracket so and then you see here in the link I put in soon article they ready for code monkey they have a lot of resources there you can maybe check it out later on and I give you all my resources that using in by grade so you are in prek to fifth graders I really encourage you to you don't have any program right now incorporating your school do it it's very helpful and the resources out there is computer science first for educators is also beats what say for educators they have a lot of resources guys next how can use Korea's incentive for my students like I mention is sometimes right now when I in the class regular class my students like to have playing with LEGOs so play with minecraft or play with roblox or they want to practicing with a leg or a beat wrist so they want to use you know I have as few as well so I have all these resources in the classroom for them but at the same time and said you know what today is the lesson from challenge want to challenge twinny i untie I'm sorry challenge what to challenge them at least you need to finish with three stars you finished that one you can move to have the option to do Legos and then you can do a Sphero or you can do minecraft but at the same time I encourage them so you know what I see you're practicing in where you have wanna start what happening you do improve it treat try to do three stars guys because that show me that you understand the concept you already realize what is the problem and you can maybe have an incentive for that like I said now for me for example Raynor the Immy trees they offer any color see Amazon they offer a free trial for you as a teacher and unlimited license for your students I highly recommend it to use the Elina you want to click there for me Lina decoder see color see the first one coders say yes thank you like I said this a must Amazon future engineer right now offering these for free guys and you can raise her and they ask you a couple of questions whatever you incorporated right now in your school how many license you need it and they reply right away to you and send it the sign up for as a teacher and you create new classrooms and I said is free so you want to take advantage for these guys I really want to appreciate it let's go back the other one I really want to say to mention to you right now is the s fear is also offering free resources for lesson plans for you unlock activities I know and also you have this fetus with you you can have that learning with a Minecraft education right now guys you want to click that Leena also I want to share with you guys minecraft right now is suffering free access for educators and teach and students so the regular lights and it's not too expensive is five dollars for the complete school year but you need to be a 365 user or microcell user to do that also little bits is offering a lot of resources for free guys this time I tried to rein us create a server to use for only for my class necks so today we cover some of these topics guys really want to say you have any questions something we covered the student engagement collaboration every unblock activities skills and incentives and I really appreciated a and here to help you guys thank you so much next alright so if you have any questions for us you can go ahead and pop that into the chat box I want to thank our teacher ambassadors so much for joining us today so we'll take a couple of minutes to just go ahead and leave some time for some Q&A and so if you have some questions you can pop them like I said in the chat box or inside of the Q&A box on page I did have a question for you my question was how do you deal with digital citizenship when students are commenting on assignments in your classroom so I've set ground rules with my students to make sure that they know exactly what they're supposed to be doing we have a policy in school especially now that they're home they're on video that the parents and the students know there's a dress code they whatever shown in the household is if there's a problem they will be reported on making substance abuse things like that going on so it's very well written out policy unfortunately because we have distance learning in the middle of the year I've spent a lot of time going over that at the beginning of the year Google's awesome has some great information that you can go through and that actually works with that PR deck so if you go to either the para dick website or the Google internet awesome website you can go through those lessons with your students so that they can do that before you actually go ahead and do video we saw lots of questions asking if we were going to be sharing out the slide deck after and we will be sending it and a followup as well as once you complete once you head out of the webinar today you'll actually get a request for a survey and so if you complete the survey you'll get some professional development credit I'm not seeing any questions kind of coming through so we'll go ahead and kind of move on to our next step here so you can contact us at info a code monkey comm we are giving away subscriptions for the Kovac crisis so you can go to wowt.com backslash Cova 19 and we'll be able to followup with you there I saw a lot of people asking that in the chat box so just wanted you to know that as well you can also contact our ambassadors after this we do have a meet the ambassadors page on our code monkey web page so Xavier page and Michelle also all worked remotely to work together on this presentation so just something that you know kind of keep in mind that it is possible to work with other people this is the best time to be able to collaborate remotely with people and be able to open up that world wide view that maybe we wouldn't have been able to have and these other opportunities so if there are no more questions once again I just wanted to thank those three for putting their time and effort today into presenting you a little bit more information on unplugged activities and how to create equitable coding experiences for your students each one of these worked very hard on presenting their information to you so
