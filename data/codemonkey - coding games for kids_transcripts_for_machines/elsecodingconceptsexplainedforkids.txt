welcome to or else let's learn about if else else is an optional part of an if statement else will run the indented commands beneath it if the condition isn't met so here we have an ifelse statement so if the banana is frozen if that condition is met these three commands these three indented commands will run and then we'll jump to outside of the if statement however if the banana isn't frozen or this is false we will go to the else part of the if else statement and we'll execute whatever commands are indented below the else statement let's look at an example so here's a challenge where we have a banana between the monkey and the goat goats love green bananas and monkeys will only eat yellow bananas so we want to know we want the program to figure out if that's a yellow or a green banana and if it's yellow give it to the monkey or if it's green the goat should go get it so we have an if else statement to help us if banana is green we are going to we could say say green and you might want to run this when you get to this challenge before you start making edits so you can these say commands can help you out but here we'll say if banana is green okay then the goat could go to the banana but otherwise else we will let the monkey have it okay so only one of these commands gets executed either the goat goes to the banana if it's green or the monkey goes to the banana let's go ahead and run it ah the monkey got it cause it's yellow here's an example where we have four frozen bananas so we know the goat needs to go to each of those and break the ice but then we need to make a decision for each banana do we want the goat to eat it or do we want the monkey to eat it and we're going to make that decision based on the condition of the banana being green or not so let's look at see how we're going to do this so here we have a for loop we're looping through each of those bananas one at a time each time we're going to have the goat go to it and hit it but then we need to make that decision so we're going to use an if else to decide who eats it so if the banana is green okay so if the banana is green we're going to have the goat go to it now if the banana isn't green then the monkey is going to go to it all right let's run this okay it's green it's yellow it's green it's yellow great now it's your turn to use if else good luck
