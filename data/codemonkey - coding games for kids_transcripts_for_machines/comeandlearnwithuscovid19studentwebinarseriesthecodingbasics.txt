all right everyone thank you for joining our last session of the day to come and learn with us this is a student's guide to learning with code monkey so it's not really a teacher centered webinar obviously feel free to join us students and all of our attendees if you don't mind just raising your hand just so I know that you can hear me and if you're not sure where to do that you can do that in the participants and when you click on participants you'll a blur you will be able to see the hand raised at hand and lower all right perfect awesome okay so we're gonna go ahead and get started so always when doing some video conferencing and things like that I always like to talk about a little bit of etiquette this is a little bit different because we are doing it with you as your students so being on time making sure that you're always 5 to 10 minutes early before the meeting everyone is muted today but if you have any questions please feel free to answer to ask them in the Q&A box and if you're not sure how to do that on your toolbar you see a little Q&A icon and you'll be able to click right there to answer any questions as far as the presentation just making sure that you're always in a good spot of here on camera making sure you have headphones and then when you're using the Q&A box please make sure that you are using school appropriate language and then if you need to use any signals or anything like that just go ahead and raise your hand for the most part we'll be able to interact with you best in the Q&A box okay so my name is Leena Saleh and I am the professional development manager here at code monkey I did teach in the classroom for about 10 years and I worked with students from K through 8 working in technology so if you have any questions or anything like that feel free to email me or reach out to me on Twitter so I just want to a little bit of backstory about code monkey so code monkey was founded in 2014 the CEO and Jonathan and his brother and his childhood best friend actually developed the company they are computer programmers and they were working with students and just notice that a lot of students didn't really want to learn in the same way you know that computer programmers did it was very boring so that's how kind of how code monkey was born so today we are going to be working on code monkey lessons and challenges one through five 11 through 15 will be focusing on some coding vocabulary and computational thinking as well as to get coding with code monkey I see a couple of other people joining from previous sessions and lessons just want to let you guys know that this is the same lesson that I have them in a few previous seventh session so if you have joined us before just know that it is the same thing ok so before we get started I actually want to just kind of take a temperature reading to kind of see everyone's background and just see how comfortable you are with coding so I'm going to launch this poll I'm gonna give everyone just a couple of minutes well just about a minute to go ahead and take this poll you we're going to do just about 10 more seconds just so I can get a good read right now we have 33 people so just waiting for a little bit more of you to go ahead and take the poll you okay so I'm just sharing a little bit of the results with you most of you the average is that most of you are beginners here which is great it's exactly what we want you to be you're still familiar about learning you're a decent coder and then have you use code monkey before mostly video not so this is great because this is a perfect introductory and then just wondering what grade levels you are it so the average grade level is fourth grade basically second through fifth grade all right so now we're gonna go ahead and get back started so the very first thing about being a computer programmer is obviously understanding the computer vocabulary that's associated with that so we're going to talk about what an algorithm is what a function is and then basically the the basic directions we'll be learning today about functions are step and turn so an algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem so any kind of mapping or anything that we basically have to do so anything that requires some kind of planning so if you think about on a traditional day when you're getting ready to go to school you will have a certain of prep of preparation needed to kind of get there or maybe if you're going to sports camp or something like that you'll have a certain amount of planning you might want to bring your snacks you have a certain order of kind of how you get outside of the door so that's a set of set of stepbystep directions that you will kind of use when doing an algorithm so we're gonna go ahead and look at my favorite video which is about an algorithm and this will just give you a little bit of background now if we want a computer to understand how to do something we need to give it an algorithm first algorithm signs like a big word doesn't it actually an algorithm is something very simple not important for us an algorithm is a list of steps you'd give computer to solve a problem or get something done imagine that you need to show someone or you brush your teeth the way you learn how to do it themselves all the little steps you do in the right order confused like rats one toothpaste on the toothbrush three open your mouth or brush your teeth nicely five mention life with water six smile it is important to explain the right steps in the right order so you can get great results so that's just a little video that I like to share to talk about what an algorithm is and will actually identify an algorithm when we kind of get moving while we start coding so now that we know kind of when algorithm is that it's a set of step by step directions that requires a little bit of planning like brushing your teeth or learning how to ride your bike or anything like that all right so the next thing that we have is our step in turn so both step and turn are functions and they both have associated arguments so an argument do we want it to do so let me tell the monkey to step we're asking him how far and when we asked the monkey to turn we also are designated a certain degree turn that the monkey will actually go through so we'll talk about that when we get into the platform itself the next thing that's pretty important outside of those two terms that we're going to be working with today is understanding what computational thinking is so computational thinking is can be seen in all things that we do schoolwide whether it's social studies or science or math or even art it's you know those special areas is really just recognizing those kinds of things so there's four parts to computational thinking the first is abstraction so that's focusing on what is relevant and filtering out unnecessary information so if you think about yourself maybe you're going to an amusement park so what we kind of want to know about the amusement part is did you have a good time and what you wore to the amusement park is not necessarily important information so we filter that out of the story it's not necessary it doesn't really have anything to do with the ultimate goal of the story this is really important when you're also doing some summaries and some things and language arts or even if you're doing a science experiment making sure that you have the focus of what is actually important then we have pattern recognition so that's observing trends this is really relevant in math concepts or in science when you're looking at graphs and you're able to see kind of looking at the data and just kind of saying is there a pattern and what it is that we're seeing then there's also the algorithmic design which is what we just talked about and algorithm and then there's decomposition that's looking what the big problem is and instead of like when you're doing a project you break it up and those smaller pieces that's the decomposition so now what we're gonna do is I'm going to show you how to sign in first and then I'm gonna give you the username and password so if you already have an account that's perfect okay but for today I would like you to go ahead and use the same account that we are kind of going to be using together so what I did is I went to code monkey comm and add code monkey comm in the righthand corner I click login and this will bring me to the log in box in the email username and the password you are going to enter in the username as webinar and the password as monkey once you have done so I would like for you to raise your hand so I know how far you've gotten or that you're there with me some other sessions some people have gotten stuck or or that kind of thing so just let us know if that is the case for you and we'll do our best to help you you okay so it looks like overall almost every single person is in so I'm gonna go ahead and get logged in as well with you so remember it's webinar and then the password is monkey with a capital and the number one and now I just click login now that I've gotten logged in you'll see that at the if you've been a code monkey before then it's changed a little bit otherwise if not it's brand new to you so over here on the left hand side is where you'll get to all of your courses when you create creations which we're not going to be doing that today that's where they're all be held and then in the discover feature our games and challenges that have been created by other students like you after this webinar today this username and password will not be valid so just keep that in mind so today we're going to be working in coding adventure so what I want everyone to do is find coding adventure part one go ahead and click on it those students who are in here you will need to have another browser or open up a web page that you can actually see on the code monkey page and go along with us so for the case of this I am using the same username and password as you as well so I'm going to go ahead and mute everything what I want you to go ahead and do is click on the challenge map when you click on the challenge map and the double arrows at the top that will take us back to the very beginning so when I do so I will go ahead and click on challenge number one and what we see here is we have Gordo and Gordo is our teacher assistant he pops up with tips and directions and anything I may know now what happens typically I'm a student and I don't like to read that much so I click out of the box and I didn't even remember what the directions were so I say what do I do you can always click on Gordo for any directions so I have some kind of a code here on the righthand side this is our code editor that means where all of our code will go is on the righthand side we want to see how the code works we click the Run button if we want to reset we can just reset the code over here on the lefthand side is our stage which is what is happening with our text so as the text is run something is happening over here on the lefthand side anything that I hover over with white text is an object and it will actually type out on the screen for us if need be so if I'm not a perfect speller that kind of happens also the language that we use in code monkey this coding adventure dota does math and game builder courses is called CoffeeScript CoffeeScript is a shorter version of the language it just means it doesn't have things like a semicolon or brackets inside of it it's just very clear and concise the goal of our all of our challenges is to always write the shortest most concise code that we can possible so what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna click run because I have code here we always debug a challenge when there's prebuilt code the tip told me to use step 15 instead of step 10 however I see this ruler here and I want to verify that that is in fact the distance that I set so I pick up my ruler and I'm going to measure for the distance when I do I'm going to type it here and I'm going to click run hooray I solved this challenge gordo gives me a little tip and you'll see here I got two stars I would like for you to either enter in the enter in the chat box I mean in the Q&A box why you think that I only got two stars on this challenge rather than three you so Wendy I saw that you raised your hand if you can just enter in the Q&A box I'd be helpful the question is why did I only get two stars instead of three okay that is correct I use more than one line of code the goal remember is to write the shortest most concise code so I can always go back did I fail this challenge I did not but there's always a more concise way to do it so now I have reached three star solution and now I'm going to do is I am going to let you work through challenge number five so you're doing challenges one through five when you're finished I would like you to raise your hand so I know that we can continue on to the next portion and I will meet you at challenge number five you and I will be working alongside you as I go if you notice the monkey does have a wristwatch on so that helps us to know which direction we would like for him to turn and it is on his left wrist you you okay I'm almost a challenge number five I hope you're getting close to me I see just about four attendees have reached challenge number five so I hope you're getting close you you guys are doing rock star coding over here okay remember to raise your hand when you've gotten to challenge number five you okay great it looks like the majority of you are with me so that's amazing all right so there's something different and unique about this challenge then something that we've seen before you can enter in the Q&A box why you think you may why this challenge looks different than anything that we have done before you you okay so there are some obstacles here as well so something we might not have seen before in the other challenges if you think about something that we worked on earlier is there something that we have not gotten the chance to see before okay good so there's multiple steps to reach the banana so that means this is actually the first time that we truly see an algorithm so this is where it requires some set of planning to get to now I'm going to show you a common mistake that might be made here and you will see that I made an error in capitalizing step and it says I don't know what step is we have to make sure that we are keeping with the right syntax to make sure that we are able to order to correctly get to the it I'm sorry so we can correctly make sure that the computer understands what it is that we're doing so the computer will let you know when it doesn't understand something so something regarding spelling or anything like that you okay my apologies alright so now that we have actually worked through that those first five set of challenges we are going to start we are going to learn something new so we're moving on to the next story map and I would like you to click on challenge number eleven objects and friends so in challenge 11 we see something new we see the function of turn two instead of saying turn right or turn left or turn 45 degrees we can see that we can specifically step to an object so when what we do is the monkey is no longer turning right or turning left we say and we want it to turn to a specific object so that's just something to note here okay so I'm gonna skip to a different challenge different challenge here and make sure that I want to go over there one more thing with you before we get close here to the end of the challenge and then you guys are going to work together so what we're going to do is if you saw Gordo just told us that that was a function of turn two I am going to go you guys are going to continue staying where you are I'm going to go to challenge number 13 and challenge 13 is something different than we've seen before before we have seen that there is only one character on the screen that's moving and/or on our stage that's moving and that character is the monkey so what coding Adventure does for you is that you don't have to associate what we call an object tag with the monkey because the computer automatically assumes that the object is the monkey itself so in this case we don't have to assume however we need the computer to identify who else is moving and in this case we need the turtle if I don't enter the period the computer will not understand that so turtle dot is an object tack just like we did with the object tag at the monkey we do the object tag of the turtle and this is important so we know who's moving so the turtle will need to move so we have to make sure that we are earth doing the correct number of distance for the turtle to move so we just learned when an object tag was and the function of turn two so what I would like for you to do now is work through 11 through 15 once you work through 11 through 15 just know it's okay if you get a onestar the first time there's no problem in failing many developers in Google and Facebook and all of those places they fail quite often when they're coding and a lot of times it has to do with those syntax on pages and pages and pages of code and the code will have to do that they had an error within their syntax so just keep that in mind that that happens and it's just always there's no problem with failure we call that I would like to call it failing forward so trying again until you get it right it's kind of like when you ride a bike the first time you are not an expert and you continue learning and eventually if you practice enough you can do some really cool tricks and things like that so I'm going to let you guys work through 11 through 15 when you have finished working through 11 through 15 just raise your hand so I can know that you are all on the same page with me and then we'll get moving to the next part you and those of you that can't see your screen or your you're looking at me while you're doing this call just make sure that you kind of have different pages you know toggling between the two pages having two different pages open and if you're still stuck you can let us know and we'll do our best to help you and we'll also give you some tips for what to do when you get stuck so we're going to give you just about another minute to work through those challenges to challenge fifteen you those of you that are struggling between tabs you'll see here I have my presentation open and I have another tab here open for code monkey and so you're not able to see my full screen because I am sharing a portion of my screen but I would click from one window this is called a window for the next window when I'm trying to work through things so you can just click the clicks plus line if you're in on Google or if you're wherever in with the zoom you just move it over so I just move it to the side so that I'm able to see it okay I'm gonna work through 15 with you you'll see that this is an assessment challenge so this is the first time this is not the first time that this means that there's no prebuilt code inside of here so it's just an assessment challenge so I know that I need to use the turtle so that I can get the monkey across to the across to the banana and I have a little bit of thinking that kind of goes through here so I'm planning it out trying to see what's going to be work best and sometimes I just wrote right or line of code and debug it and other times I might write out all the code so but it's easier for me to see where the error is when we work through it like that awesome you guys did a great job we worked on functions what an algorithm was a function is step with the argument of whatever we want it to so step 10 sep 2013 11 and we also learn turn to and what an object tag list so you actually learned five really important vocabulary terms to help you with computer science and programming so if you're wondering how do you get logged in when you're finished our team is going to be sending a this recording to your teachers as well as a way to request free access for coab it 19 subscription and we want you to obviously continue coding now this is a great question a common question we've had what do you do when you get stuck so one question is to send a message to your teacher or maybe ask a friend for help review past challenges so in code monkeys coding adventure you can always go back to previous challenges that you played just like when I got to star solutions and those things I went back and I tried them again so you can always go back up you're feeling stuck and you can use super hints so what happens is when I missed a lot of times on my screen gordo will pop up with a text bubble and his text bubble will be a super hint for you and teachers can turn those off as well so now that we've worked through those coding challenges we've done quite a lot today if you have any questions please put them in the Q&A box and we will get to them as fast as we can you teachers I know that there are a few of you teachers on here so just an essence of time we have a couple of minutes I would like to show you the new the teacher side of things has also changed so if you have any questions we do have some resources and things in the in our new part of the menu here it'll say the Help Center so if you're having any questions or anything like that you can just go ahead and click the Help Center and that will give you some questions on some ways to kind of navigate that new screen all right so we have worked through those challenges kind of went over how to get into coding adventure itself and kind of what how to use the ruler and what Gordo was for how to go back and revisit past challenges so we want to thank you so much for spending your afternoon with us and if you have any questions you can always reach out to us at code monkey s tu and you can also email us with any questions remember to write code catch bananas and save the world you guys have a wonderful day bye
