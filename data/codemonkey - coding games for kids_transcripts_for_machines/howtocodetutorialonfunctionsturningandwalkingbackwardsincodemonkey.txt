hi welcome back to our Code Monkey tutorials today we will learn about objects and how to use them we will also learn two new ways to make the monkey turn how to make him walk backwards and a helpful trick ready here we go what are objects objects are everything in the scene we can interact with like the bush Bridge banana and turtle some objects have a set of actions they can do for example the monkey can step and turn these actions are called functions and the input we add to them is called an argument for example in Step 10 we have the function step with the argument 10 now let's talk about the function turn there are three ways to make an object turn the first way is to use turn right or left which we already know a second way to turn is by using degrees like turn 45 or turn minus 90 but how would you know by how how many degrees to turn you ask well our ruler is secretly also a protractor when we measure the distance from the monkey to the banana it also shows the number 45 which is the angle the monkey has to turn in order to face the banana you can use the ruler to measure degrees from the monkey or from the turtle the third and final way to turn is by using the function turn to when using turn to we don't need to use right left or or a number the turn to function calculates the direction to turn in order to face another object all we need is a name of another object such as banana or Bridge another useful skill you are going to learn in this video is walking backwards remember that in order to tell the monkey to go forward we type step 10 so if we wanted to go backwards we type step minus 10 minus 10 will be read by the computer in this context just like 10 steps backwards now I want to show you a cool trick if you hover over any object on the stage you will see its name appear next to it if you click on the object its name will be added to the editor this can come in handy if you don't feel like typing right now thank you for watching this tutorial now it's time for you to practice turning and walking backwards but remember if you do it in real life be careful not to step on any bananas good luck
