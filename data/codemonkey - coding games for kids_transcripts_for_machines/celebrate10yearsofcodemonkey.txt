10 years of coding learning and fun join us as we celebrate a decade of Code Monkey the Innovative platform where kids learn to code through play my inspiration for Code Monkey came when I hosted my own coding classes for kids I saw how effective game based learning is in computer science education my vision when starting Code Monkey was to scale this experience online to teachers in their class room with their students all over the world we really wanted to give every child an opportunity to learn this amazing profession and skill of coding learning should be fun and accessible this is why we created an experience that is gender neutral lightweight easy to implement anywhere in the world with a basic laptop and a basic internet connection check out this game I created you created a game how with Code Monkey Code Monkey was easily adaptable into this school and what I've been using the lessons that come with codee monkey are absolutely fantastic and allows me to also be creative and use my own teaching Style with it we believe every child should have some kind of digital literacy and coding literacy all the kids and I know that have been exposed to Code Monkey really love it and they are influenced by it it has a lot of value students have different abilities so they are able to go at their own pace it gives them the opportunity to be successful in their own ways we don't have to compare them to anybody else they very much like Code Monkey they're obsessed with it it's like a game to them but they're actually learning about conditionals things like that I love playing with my friends on Code Monkey we solve puzzles and help each other when I have a big problem code Mony helps me break it into smaller bits and then I can solve it one by one achieving student engagement is the key factor in achieving a continuous learning experience also outside of the classroom kids have a lot of screen time these days they can have educational screen time with code monkey and build their problem solving skills create games and who knows maybe open the door to new opportunities at the heart of code mononke are the countless stories of growth the biggest thing that we've noticed from students is that critical thinking skills that's important in every facet of their life so really making them stop think about what they're going to do see if that problem works sometimes you get stuck on a challenge that you just can't figure out you have to figure out different ways about it not only learning the problem solving aspect of it but they're persevering through those difficult coding Concepts they're also learning collaboration being able to work with each other and problem solve together it also allows them to be creative too especially with the game building courses and things like that the journey with Code Monkey doesn't just end in the classroom let's take a glimpse into the future where today's Young coders become tomorrow's Tech innovators through code monkey today's students take their first steps towards tomorrow's careers in robotics AI biotech and Tech startups embarking on a future rich with technological innovation and opportunities let's take a look back at how code monkey has evolved from our first coding challenges to our latest interactive courses our journey has been incredible Cod monkey was born in a classroom was created for classrooms and teachers first that's the way we continue to manage the Code Monkey experience we're here in our office is working very far away from the actual usage in the classroom so it's really important to us to hear what teachers have to say we rely on teachers feedback constantly to continue improve and enrich the product in 10 years we've reached mileston that once seemed like distant dreams today we celebrate this achievement and look forward to more in a decade code monkey has reached over 34 million users solved over 600 million challenges and is now in more than 206 countries and 18 th000 schools our beloved monkey has been a constant companion on our journey making friends along the way that reflect the growth and diversity of our Vibrant Community as we look back on these 10 years we are filled with gratitude and excitement here's to coding learning and growing together happy anniversary Code Monkey we love Cod monkey we love Cod monkey a heartfelt thank you to our community your passion to coding is what drives us forward keep exploring keep coding and keep dreaming monkey monkey thank you cold monkey N C Monkey thank you cold monkey
