Oh all right everyone thank you so much for joining us um welcome to code monkeys webinar coding adventure in your classroom thank you for joining us this afternoon please follow us on Twitter at code monkey s tu or on our Instagram also please tweet at us today during today's webinar at hashtag code monkey webinar we will do our best to answer any live tweets during today's webinar my team is also here to answer any questions that you may have and then following today's webinar we'll send you information regarding your PD certificate so let's get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world so I was like to start off the webinar discussing about Who I am since you're I'm sure you're wondering who who who who I am and basically what I do so my name is Lena Saleh and I'm the professional development manager here at code monkey I have 10 years of education experience actually a little bit more now nine of those years I spent in the classroom I was a former stem teacher in which I developed curriculum across my district for grades K through 12 oh I'm sorry sometimes you get so excited when you're moving through that you forget the extra part so backtoschool webinar with coding adventure in your classroom so I just want you to be able to see this slides now you can be on the same page with me here so my apologies about that anyway so I'm a former stem teacher I help write curriculum for K through 12 for our district and scaffolding what that looks like I'm also a professional development leader so what that means is I've done workshops prior to my role here at code monkey in of my districts and out of my districts kind of across the country I'm also an organizer of EdTech Austin and so we basically marry the partnerships between teachers and the local ed tech scene and kind of create for that kind of seamless partnership I'm also very passionate about computer science doesn't know me and those of you that don't both my parents never graduated from college or never even went to college and I just didn't know that that was there I just always thought that Siot science was with computers and I never really understood what that was and so I'm just passionate about creating that opportunity for students and knowing that coding is not just for one but for all so I think that's pretty important um you can always tweet at me here at Lena at code monkey studio or a code monkey sorry excuse me or you can email me for any questions or anything that you might have from today's webinar or maybe some thoughts that you have after our webinar today so thank you once again for joining us and we're gonna go ahead and get started here oh sorry before we get started though I do want to introduce our panelists here on the lefthand side in the red jacket we have Zoe she is our marketing and media manager and on the right hand side we have Talia she's the customer success manager both really awesome they're joining us from Israel which is where our main office is located and so it's midnight for them so thank you so much for taking that time to join us today both of you so now let's kick it off and let's get started so today we're going to review how to run a lesson in your classroom with coding adventure we're going to go into the intro to coding adventure itself what a coding adventure is what language we use to code in then we're going to use coding adventure with our new feature code monkey lessons which is our sorry which is poopsies I mean to do that which is our new mode that we can use so we're going to discuss what it is the interface the layout and then we're gonna work through lessons 1 & 3 to get you started it with this year fresh with coding adventure how to track students progress some of the key concepts that are intertwined within there we're going to talk about skill mode and why we use it some new features and new courses that we have here at code monkey and then we're gonna leave some time for you at the end for coding adventure I mean sorry for questions alright so coding adventure in your classroom so what is coding adventure I'm sure many of you already know but if you don't know I like to always review what coding adventure course is so coding adventure is for grades three through eight it's a very it's a game based course with two hundredplus coding levels both in story mode and skill mode which will discuss universal coding concepts that go across any coding language it teaches that textbased coding which is CoffeeScript which we'll talk about here in just a minute and then there's no prior coding experience that's needed to begin um it's very scaffolded and goes linearly very interactive kids are very excited about it and they really enjoy making the monkey catch the banana which we'll do today so what is CoffeeScript what language is it any time I'm at conferences or even students asking me what CoffeeScript even is CoffeeScript is a real computer language real people do use it so you can look it up and google it at any time it is a shorter version of JavaScript and Python so think about like the meat and potatoes of the language it's very clean there's no like syntax hanging down or curly brackets or any of that kind of thing we know and you know that students have a really hard time putting periods in and asking them to do a semicolon is even more challenging and syntax especially when you're a new coder really is the thing that really ties you down and so CoffeeScript really makes it easy if we're that seamless transition to whatever next language you want to learn so let's get into coding adventure using the code monkey lessons so first what are the code monkey lessons and what is it that I'm talking about so code monkey lessons like I said is our newest feature it's a feature that helps you more easily conduct your coding classes so excuse me you can access it from the classroom dashboard it it also gives you the ability to access individualize lesson plans based on the lesson that you're teaching and gives you the challenges that are associated within those lessons it's also a distinct mode for when you're teaching and when students play so we'll take a look at what that looks like and then it's also saves the teaching progress for each progress for each class so it's not just Universal for all of your classes it saves it very specific to each one of the classrooms that you're working in all right so let's go ahead and let's take a look at lesson mode itself so I'm gonna spare you of how we actually get to lesson mode if you're not sure we do have a really nice short tutorial about lesson mode and kind of like how to get there and that kind of a thing but we're gonna go ahead here and get started with what is the user in what the interface looks like so coding it I mean the lesson code monkey lessons is set up exactly like our lesson plans so it has the challenges that are associated with it with a lesson plan but in how it's set up is it is broken into three parts the first part is introduction the second part is the playtime and then it will have certain challenges that are associated there and then the last part is the debrief so set up just like I said very similarly over here on the right hand side we see all of the challenges as well as our reference and character card and we'll look at all of those here in just a moment you so before so let's let's get into the teaching of sorry just wanna move sometimes when you're doing these zooms you have toolbars are kind of getting your ways there so here I always like to kick off my school year really getting students really jazzed about coding so how do we do that so I usually introduce with an unplugged coding activity in the code monkey lessons there are always some kind of an unplugged activity intertwine with in the lesson so that's just something to keep in mind reacher research states that it doesn't unplug activities don't make students better coders but it makes them have better selfefficacy and better vocabulary so can't really beat that right so kind of I feel like it really gives them that background knowledge to really be successful and apply it to the challenges themselves so this is my most favorite coding activity I do in teacher trainings I've really been all across the country doing this activity and teachers always love it just as much as the students do so I don't really know what the technical name of it but I've call it blindfolded coding so here are the activity directions so you will choose three students in your classroom so usually when I do this activity I bring all my students down to like my little presentation area or wherever you kind of had them and even 5th graders I had them sit on the floor didn't matter to me so I have them sit down and then I set up to like station well let's just talk about what the roles are so first you choose three students and I choose one student who is the gives the directions and I call them like the guide or the mapper then I have one student who is going to be blindfolded and that's their gonna receive the directions then you have another student who's the scripter so really they're like dictating script and writing it down so everyone can see it and then the materials that you need two bowls you can do cups you can do whatever kind of works for you in your classroom one blindfold and then items to fill that bowl so I've done it with beads and that tend to get all over the floor so usually when I did it in my classroom I would do it with like unicorn erasers I was like you know the big thing or those poop emoji erasers or whatever it is that kind of get the kids excited and so when I did that what you basically do is you set up two bowls pretty considerable distance apart making sure there's nowhere for them to trip or fall or whatever you really want them to be able to trust kind of how they're going so one so then you set them apart the student that's blindfold you can see where they are not a big deal makes no difference in fact you want them to know where it is and then the mapper will guide the student okay using the code that we have here so I have very explicit code here step turn right turn left and then I have students making sure that we determine what how they step so heel toe so this isn't really part of the code but it is something that you want to establish because when students are blindfolded and what I've done this several times with teachers and when they're blindfolded and I have not said walk heel toe then they end up like tiptoeing little tiny steps or some people make giant leaps so this is just a way to keep it really consistent because we really want consistent concise code pick up set down and then pour okay so then the scripter is going to be dictating this on the on the board so the guide is so the goal is to guide the student to dump the bowl with items into it into the end people I notice here that I'm missing a B on this air in the spelling thing so you know of course your students would catch that if they saw it but there it is and so what we want to have happen is as you can see here these this set of students here they're actually teacher in the teacher College they're doing this activity here and you can see what starts to happen is that they're very offbalance and not trusting really where they are as well as this gentleman here when he was doing it um hopefully this kind of goes through but anyway unless he's doing it he was very like wishywashy about where he was going so really making sure that the students are kind of guiding them and in writing those steps down there for it therefore so that if we ever were to repeat it again we could repeat the code so like I said they're blindfolded they're walking they dump one empty I mean they dumped the bowl with the objects in it and they walk it over and dump it into the other bowl and you'll see things start to happen so it's an algorithm there's lots of planning that's involved and then there's also that sense of trust they really have to trust the direction giver I've seen this where teachers have actually watch walk to other teachers into the into the wall so just some things to kind of keep in mind and kind of watch as your students are kind of going through but you'll see that you're immediately off balance so you have to really rely on your senses so it's just something to really kind of understand as we're kind of going through and then they walk it over and they pour the objects into the board so we've seen many different ways that a computer would work and actually as the monkey does when we do challenge number five it's the first time we see an algorithm and also some other factors are like an if statement if something is there it won't keep walking as you saw this young lady on the lefthand side when she was walking she reached out really quickly to the bookshelves even though she knew she was safe she even saw where the items were she just didn't trust her own senses and that happens to you sometimes when you're walking you know to the bathroom is it a little of a night so just some things to kind of go through and the kids like I said love this you can have introduced it and then have the kids go and do it themselves they get really jazzed about it so what better way to get jazzed up about the year then to do some kind of an unplugged activity all right so now let's go ahead and let's get moving here so here I am in lesson mode and like I said if you'd not sure how to get there there's many ways you just do from the classroom dashboard the CMI classrooms click on your classroom and then you'll see it'll populate right into this lesson mode here so here I am on lesson number one and what I'm going to do is I'm going to begin the lesson once I confirm begin lesson I want to show you what it looks like on the student side of it because I just think this is an important thing for you to be able to see here and you can see that oops just make sure I show this here you can see here that it says your teacher will unlock challenges shortly so that's just really to keep all of your students together we know how they do and you know how they like to get super ahead of themselves so this just really keeps everyone all together in one spot so let's head back to our teacher dashboard I'm sorry to our code monkey lessons and so I began a lesson you saw would it look like on the student side of it now let's go ahead and let's take a look at our lesson plans so I've actually already oh sorry hold on like I said sometimes these toolbars make it a little bit harder to navigate here so or work in here okay so you should be able to see here that I'm one lesson one so how did I do that I just accessed it from on the righthand side where it said lessons and it pulled me up the specific PDF that matches with the lesson that we're going to so the first thing that we see here in the lesson is we see basically a summary about what this lesson is going to be about so take some time to read on their own I'm not going to read it with you today I feel like we're all pretty good at that remember the lesson plans are always just a guide and they're always designed to be about 45 minutes so if you're ever wondering about that that's kind of how each of the lessons are designed all right so here we are on the objectives and so what I do with my student objectives always have a coating or a tech notebook and so I have the students write down their objectives so we can know at the end of the day that we have reached our objectives or maybe we still need to work or kind of struggling on one so the students are writing these down so define coding and computer programming become familiar with the code monkey platform which we're going to do together and then we're going to work through challenges zero through five together so having those students write that down next I have these components here so the components under the teacher resources I will show you those in just a little bit but they do have these here so I have the students also do vocabulary work with these so I want them to know what the functions of step and turn what they actually mean so I have them draw a picture and then write an example of what it is in their notebooks it's always good for students to have extra resources because we all know they're very forgetful when they need to know different things so then the terms here that we're also going to be focusing on a challenge and what CoffeeScript means and we just coffeescript meet so you know that as well next we have our standards Zoey and my team will actually send you where this where you can find the specific standards but outside of here we do have a specific place that you can't find the standards if you're not wanting to go and hunt through the lesson plans themselves okay so we are going to go ahead and get started so here at the very very beginning there is an activity and it's an unplugged activity now I'm just kind of modified this a little bit for the sake of today and so this tells us to play a short game where you place an object in the room and so to do so what I do is I usually just display this on the board I kind of want all my students to kind of work through it together and kind of develop that kind of collaboration because coding is really not something it is something you do solo but really it's about like I said failing forward and kind of working through problems together and so here we will see we have our whiteboard and it's really important to have graph paper because you really want to know that it's an XY coordinate the code or the stage itself for instance an XY coordinate so you just want to kind of make sure that you're keeping with that and making sure that you're in twining that as much as possible so we're not just guessing where they go because we don't want our students to just guess either so here student a is facing the board and we want to count the steps I mean we want our student aid to move so we see here on the left hand side that I have a key that I want the kids to kind of follow step turn right to turn left and I also have that it's one square equals one step so that's also some graphic like messages I mean some there's also a key there to kind of interpret that okay so student a is facing the whiteboard and we want them to do something so here we want our student to turn right and then step the direction so when we count the squares we step five and then we always want to step the direction in which we face and then we step four because a computer not that this is my most favorite term I heard it from a Harvard professor and many coding professors they like to say that the computer doesn't have a brain so just something to think about they think about it as as teachers I hate this word being stupid and that we have to tell it what to do not my favorite term to use I just like to say that the computer can't think for itself so we need to give it the information for it to do it so here we are dictating the code for the students to see another algorithm as well TURN RIGHT step 5 turn left and step 4 that's just kind of a way to kind of introduce that so we do that activity which we just took directly from the lesson plans nothing that like is any different it just kind of modified it instead of doing an object and I did it together on the board talks about next thing it talks about is the different languages which we just talked about and now we get into the play time so here this says for the students to log in and kind of play I don't ever introduce it like that and I'm not going to specifically assign them the challenges yet because I want to do something together so while my students are all sitting there we've solved this one unplug challenge on the board I bring all of them down to the carpet I'm gonna exit out of everything and I'm just gonna bring a student up that I know is not super strong not an expert coder I don't want an expert coder I want someone who the students trust and that if they make a mistake they have the ability could not be so flustered and figure out kind of what to do so I bring up a student the students name is Savannah she comes up to the board and I step back I'm completely just turned from a teacher into a facilitator I don't want I don't want me to be really involved in the picture at all so Savannah is gonna have to figure out what do I do what do I do here so I don't give her any guidance and I just let her take control I first the class is usually supermom until they figure out what to do so we get our solution here and now we move on to the next challenge now we saw that the run makes him run and then kind of what we do so this is all about failing forward there no wrong way to do it there's always a more concise way to do it but not really a wrong way to do it so she may see the directions there and do that she might figure out that she can use this ruler and measure the distance of however she wants to do it and so here when students are learning how to code they often will do it in two separate lines and I will not say one thing I'll just kind of let it happen and later it's gonna be more of a teachable moment here and now now there's two stars and they may start to pick up on it you'll see here that there's a little tip here and that Gordo is usually cheerleading or maybe introducing a concept as we go along so now the students are really getting confident they're really getting super excited and if she gets stuck I ask her to call on anyone in the crowd but they must give an explanation as to why why she should do what she should do just gives them really good way to like start really doing that procedural text writing or really just to get them to explain their thinking and so here she measures the distance and she figures it out and she gets to the end and challenges three and four it introduces the directionality so I'm not going to solve this challenge specifically with you because the students start to get the idea and I stop it too and I just want to note something on here because I think it's important one of my teacher ambassadors a student shared that with them and I didn't even notice this myself he's over here on the left hand side is a watch and so the watches just helps with the directionality for code monkey himself okay so I stopped at challenge number three and then now I'm going to move on to before I let them go I'm gonna introduce them into an algorithm now I'm very familiar with the code monkey platform so I want you to also be aware as well challenge five is a very challenging challenge for students even though it looks like it's super easy they have a hard time understanding that there's a certain amount of planning involved here okay so as the students are kind of going through this you can see I'm solving this with you but before I do this I'm going to introduce what an algorithm is because the students do need to know the sense of term it will retake about algorithm in lesson number two we're not going to do lesson number two for the sake of today but I did want to kind of show you that part of that okay so now I've done those challenges and now I want to talk to you about what an algorithm is so an algorithm is a recipe or I'm sure as you figured out right now kind of a set of directions what you put in is what you get out or you put something in and you get something else so think about like chocolate chip cookies they're they're not really cookies until I put them in the oven and when I get them out they're cookies and they're delicious not that I'm not the raw cookie dough isn't delicious but I just get a different result than what I put it and so we just solved challenge number five I love to use this video this is an algorithm video from BBC my team will share this with you I'm just going to play a little bit of the video so you can get an idea of what I like to share with my students if we want a computer to understand how to do something we need to give it an algorithm pick up first algorithm sounds like a big word doesn't it but actually an algorithm is something very simple but important to us an algorithm is a list of steps you'd give to computers to solve a problem or get something done imagine that you need to show someone or you brush your teeth to paint and learn how to do it themselves you would need to experience all the little steps you do in the right order to understand like this on the dis brush 3 or crush your teeth nicely 5 mention mice with water six smile it is important to explain the right steps in the right order so you can get great results okay a video that I like like I said a video that I like to use I'm kind of share with students I feel like even even middle school students liked this video because it's very explicit about what it what it's teaching there okay so we talked about what an algorithm is and then I'm going to now assign the challenges to my students so now if we go to what the student looks like I just like to show you this because I think it is important so you can understand where where we are now you can see that the student is no longer frozen that they can now continue and they only have access to those challenges that are within the lesson so just important to note oops sorry really so you didn't see that but now you can see that they are active here and that they have the ability to code and they're only going to do those challenges that are associated with the lessons themselves so now let's go back to our lesson that we are reviewing here okay so now we've done our playtime that it had for us to discuss and it talks about on the left about the stage so I we always suggest looking up the lesson plans before even if you're not a super strong coder it just gives you that really strong sense about what it is to do you know I know this we're always guilty of sometimes flying from the seat of our pants but it's really good and inefficient to check these out beforehand at least as a guide so we work through those challenges and then now we get to the debrief so what did you learn today what did you like most about coding adventure so just from Yui getting them excited challenges zero through ten are really just to get the students excited and familiar with the concepts we don't want to start off with something super super hard to begin with because then they're not going to want to continue ok so then I can end the playtime and once I end the playtime I can then mark chalant or mark this lesson as complete and when I do so it will grade this out now I'm still working in another lesson so I just have alright just have to make sure I end the lesson before I do that and then you'll see that it is marked as complete right down here so just something a kind of note alright so now let's get into lesson number three which is which is objectoriented programming I'm gonna move a little bit quicker through this because I think that first part really takes the most time and so then we're just going to kind of move through here so now I'm on challenge sorry I tend to do this mixes up but that's not what I mean lesson number three and we're going to do challenges 12 we're basically going to do challenges 11 through 15 and I'll show you exactly kind of what that looks like here in just a moment okay so I am going to go through objectoriented programming so here in the lessons themselves we have the same sort of setup the the objectives that we're doing here is what they were reviewing what they learned in previous a previous lesson we skipped lesson number two it's just the back half of that intro discuss the concept of planning which we just talked about the algorithm and then complete challenges 11 through 15 so here we're gonna introduce some brand new terms the turn to and the turtle step I always like to really talk about these with teachers and really talk about them with students because they really are very hard concepts for them to kind of understand same standards all that other kind of stuff here the activity in the room is to kind of play in this lesson is to play a game of like Simon Says where you put an object in the room and you have them turn specifically to that object like in a game of Simon Says so their only move when it says turn so instead of turning right and turning left or turning a degree turn we're turning specifically to something like you do with your brain you turn so that you want to go out the door I'm up thinking oh I need to turn right turn left I think I need to go to the door and I need to walk out the door so same sort of concept here okay this one has them write down a map of how they get to school so what I usually do is I usually have them map out how I get from my classroom to the PE room or something like that in a very set by step directions this is a great place to do pair share with students and just being able to kind of share that information with them okay and then sharing that and they'll find out they have extra steps that are not needed we want them to have the shortest most concise set of directions to be able to go through so now this says let's go ahead and let's do play time and here this says have them work through challenges 11 through 15 with two stars we suggest the younger grades two stars and we suggest the older greys three stars so something to keep in mind we'll talk about that so let's look at challenge number 12 which is what this tells us to do so in our walkthrough so I'm gonna make sure I begin the lesson so the kids are seeing what I see and then I'm going to click challenge number 12 and we're going to solve this so here like I said I'm gonna do bug my challenge here and you'll see that I'm turning specifically to the object you'll also see here along the bottom in introduction to the buttons the buttons don't type they don't they're not draganddrop they just type out for students it really helps for those students with special needs dyslexia or ll learners or even those students that just are not great spellers so they're not tied down anything with the white text next to it also types out so just something to keep in mind so here I don't want to turn to the banana I want to turn to the bridge and then I want to turn specifically to the banana you'll see here that I did not fully solve this yet but you do see how he specifically is now turning to an object this syntax things sometimes can be an issue for students or just making sure that they check their syntax is kind of important and then before moving on what is an object tab this is pretty important I visited like I said a lot of classrooms and talked with a lot of students and you know as we're kind of moving through this they just really don't understand this concept so I'm going to do something here at the top and you can notice there's something different about the code here okay so we have the turtle moving how do we get the turtle to move well the computer automatically assumes member has it only has the brain for what we have here that the monkey is the main character so the monkey is who's running or this set of challenges is the monkey who is the main I mean is the main character which is the monkey and the monkey is the one who's doing the moving so we don't have to tell the computer every single time it is not wrong if we do that okay but it is not necessary so here we have the turtle moving if I don't have this object tag here you'll see that the monkey just continues moving so we have to tell the computer who needs to move this is a very abstract concept for our students to understand so it's important for you to also see that too that we just need to associate what the object tag is themselves so I always show them this before because it's just very tricky and it's very hard to understand if you're not understanding okay well I just see that there I know it needs to but why does it because the computer needs to know if you don't have the period there the computer also doesn't know what to do so we have to make sure that we associate the object tab with what's moving okay after I do that then I assign the challenges to them and when I assign the challenges to them I can I'm just going to refresh this really quickly when I sign the challenges to them they will only have access to those specific challenges now normally this is grayed out but my Internet's a little getting a little sometimes with the zoom it gets a little tricky so it's not that it doesn't it does work in its full way I'm just my Internet's a little shaky right now so but so let's talk about the classroom dashboard and how we track students progress so here in the dash this is the student progress page here on the progress page it is a teacher's best friend it's your best friend why is it your best friend because it contains all the answers to everything you don't have to go hunting or fishing or trying to figure out any of those kinds of things this contains all the answers here here you can see when I do the limit progress based on the lessons taught you'll see that now it's only has access to the lessons for which I want them to be doing just then that way it just kind of keeps everyone on the same thing when I hit free play it will kind of open it will open it up completely to them okay so you're looking at these stars we talked about the Stars what do the stars even mean so a 3 star solution is the shortest most concise code a 2 star solution means that they took an extra step to get there and a 1 star solution means they were able to get the banana or get the object that they needed to but they just really were not understanding that concept I like to call those students to struggle bus so here how do I figure out even what the answer is so up here in green are all of the three star solutions to every single challenge so you're not like I said not having to go to hunt you know and that student comes up to you and you're panicked and you're like I don't know why don't you phone a friend you don't need a phone to friend have all the answers right here for you ok also if a student is struggling you can click on it see how many times they attempted a challenge and you can see the answer in real time how they solved it really creating that authentic conversation many times I've used this when my kids are struggling and I look at their code and I think to myself mmm I don't really know I come back and I look at my solution and I compare it to theirs and then I can really have that conversation to really see what it is that they're kind of meeting so the limit progress is really important you can limit it based on a lesson that you're taught you can do free or you can just do a very specific one and you'll see that they have no access to that beyond their okay so we worked through the second lesson and really like really showing them what they need to do here I just want to note this since we landed here that this is an assessment challenge it means that there's no prebuilt goat code and it's taking what they've learned prior and applying the application here okay all right so here at the end of the play time there is also this debrief and this is doing challenge 14 which we just did together which is the object text so just something to kind of keep in mind there all right so what coding concepts did we learn the step the turn that turn to and the turtle step something I want to mention really quickly is about the coding concepts they are all listed here at the top I like to call them units but they're really coding concepts so first we do our stepping and turning our turn to turtle the times loop and then variables okay so kind of moves through there so I wanted to show you actually on a challenge itself here how we kind of understand how that matches itself so here we have a story map in each world with an Astoria map has its own concept of which the students are going through so just something there as well okay so I'm just going to quick talk about skill mode so skill mode is an extra reinforcement of skills you saw it right here on the story map you can access it here or from the main screen it's basically a reinforcement of skills so you have a student who is really really advanced and you need to differentiate for them you can put them in a skill mode and skill mode opens up after the end of each coding concept the students have learned it just as a deeper dive into that or if students are really struggling like when students do variables I highly highly suggest that you use the skill mode for them there okay so now we're going to move on to our news and notes here I know that was pretty quick a little intro into everything but I did want to talk about our newest courses that we have so our newest course here is the banana tails and banana tails is a Python course for students in the older grades grades 5 through 8 it's really a deeper duck it's very similar to coding adventure and that it moves through a map but it does work in full Python we also have cody code monkey junior which the all the teacher has been raving about it all four ambassadors you're super jazzed about it is a based coding Pro our course in which students work through sequencing and loops and this is for our preschool to early kindergarten age students okay so let's go ahead and let's review our objectives that we went over today how to run a lesson in your classroom with coding adventure an intro into coding adventure what CoffeeScript was we talked about coding adventure using lesson mode what it is the interface the lessons we've did lessons one in lesson three how to track your student progress where to find the coding concepts what skill mode is any news and notes and now we're gonna leave some time here for a Q&A but before I do that I just want to briefly briefly mention something and then we'll leave some time here over here on the right hand side our teacher resources something that I like to mention is the coding concepts such as what I talked about earlier where you can find those vocabulary for stepping and turning and then there's all kinds of like video tutorials and things to just kind of note so I highly recommend looking through that I think it's very beneficial for you there's a lot of resources that you're probably unsure of there okay yes there are okay so now I'm gonna leave some time for Q&A so you can leave it in the chat box and I'm just gonna go to the Q&A here so if you have any questions please put it into the chat box there so I have one question here are there lesson plans available for the trial version as well there are they're just going to be a limited version because you don't have access to all the challenges it will it will give you the lessons challenge number 30 a well and more question where can I find the unplugged coding activity so the unplugged coding activities are located in the lesson plans they're always in the intro they're not specifically listed like on their own but they are right there in the beginning so that's nice there okay suade a couple so that's a great question so what grades is coding adventure recommended for coding adventure is recommended as for grades 3 through 8 I personally just find that with second grade it gets a little bit tricky with the variables but they absolutely can do it I've worked with many students as far as that goes and then how many classes can you set up you can set up however many classes you want most of the subscriptions that we have are based on students seats so it's just dependent on how many you put in a in a classroom but the max for each classroom is 50 this next question assuming previous coding experience where should it greater start I always suggest that they start from the beginning because you really want to get them intertwined in the platform itself and making sure that they understand but they'll move pretty quickly through the first like at least 30 challenges once they get to variables that tends to be pretty tricky for them but that's where I would start with them it's just definitely start them from the beginning and it's fine if they move pretty quickly through that first part of coding adventure Wanda we will send you a followup internment and followup regarding your question um this program is for grades its program is for k2 a our code code monkey junior is for the younger ages and then you can start some parts of coding adventure pretty early there is like a scope and thing so if you're interested we can definitely help you with that great question Brian had a question in FreePlay he said I understand that students can work through all of the lessons is that correct it is correct unless you limit them then they can move freely just keep in mind that it is does move in a linear manner so they cannot skip around or anything like that as a teacher you have the ability to skip around and access things but they cannot they have to move in a linear pattern this is a really great question does grade level really matter if they have never coded before no it does not we we do not base it on that we I like to think and we like to think of coding as a language like if you're learning Spanish in kindergarten and if you're learning Spanish like an old lady like me you will still learn Spanish in the same way so we there is no we don't really like to say that there is a grade requirement I have another question the teacher assigns the lessons or it runs on students levels so if you assign the lesson to them then they only are working with you in that lesson mode to the specific set of challenges that are in the lesson itself and then so that's kind of how that goes and then it does it does if you want them to have free play like if you want them to just move at their own level then you wouldn't you don't have to limit any progress they can just kind of move along as they go okay so you have any questions I see that there's a couple more questions we'll try to get to your answers after today's webinar we want to honor your time thank you so much for spending time with us today directly following this as soon as we end the webinar you will receive a feedback form and in the feedback form we'll pop up with a after you complete the feedback form you'll receive your professional development certificate so just to kind of keep that aware all unanswered questions will answer you by email so we'll follow up with you after today's webinar thank you again so much for joining us thank you Talia and Zoe for taking on the questions and answering me with being so late there and thank all of you for spending your time with us today remember to write code catch bananas and save the world you guys have an amazing day Thanks you
