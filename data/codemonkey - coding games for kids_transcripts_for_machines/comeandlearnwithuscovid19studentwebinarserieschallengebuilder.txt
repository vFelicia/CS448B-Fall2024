hello everybody and thank you so much for joining it yes we will give a everyone a chance to populate inside of the room and then we will get started so we are looking forward to coding with you all today all right we will give everyone just another minute to go ahead and head into our zoom room here but if you can hear me if you can go ahead and raise your hand that will let me know that you are with me awesome as a rock star just another minute and we will get started I am going to launch a poll right now for you to take so you can just take a minute why you guys are waiting to take this poll raise your hand if you are able to see the pole just so I know that you're able to see it I don't see anyone taking it ok great you just take a couple of seconds here to go ahead and fill out this poll and then we're gonna get started awesome because our rock stars you you okay those of you are joining us so if you can go ahead and fill out this poll really quickly there's still about three of you that have not voted and panelists you're also welcome to vote as well you okay see some more people are still joining us.we if you just joined us if you see the pool you're welcome to go ahead and hop on that pole otherwise I'm going to end that we're going to get started and I will share those results with you here in just a few minutes okay welcome to a coming welcome to our online webinar session this is a session design for students so we're going to be working with you your students on how to work with our challenge builder and learning some coding concepts along the way so thank you again for joining us you so a couple of things just some reminders I may open this up later for some of you to go ahead and participate with us if you do hear that yourself is if you do see that you are unliked and you're unmuted just please make sure that you're you mute yourself once you're finished talking because everyone can hear you wherever they are and it hears like an echo even though you may not hear it on your end make sure that you have headphones in that's always just a really nice reminder for people around you and then when you are working in that chat box which we will open up here very shortly if you could just make sure that you're using responsible language and questions also if along the way you're kind of getting stuck on something maybe you need a little bit extra help you can just make sure that you know because if you you are specific about the question that you're asking because if I just say hey I need help that could mean anything it can mean anything from I dropped something on the ground I need you to help me or I have something on my screen I'm stuck on so just please make sure you're very specific about your questions that helps us help you and then right here along the bottom we see a couple of things here we see our chat the raise hand and the QA the Q&A box is open for you at any time to ask any questions and the chat box will be kind of locked down and will be opened up so you'll know when we open it so I always like to start off by just introducing Who I am my name is lina saleh i'm the professional development manager here at code monkey i see several familiar names and all on our list here so thank you so much for taking the time to join us as well as there are quite a bit of educators as there are students so thank you I have worked in the education for over a decade well more than that now and so I just really enjoy and miss working with kiddos I'm gonna introduce our other panel members and hand it off thanks Lena my name is Mark Dozier I am a customer success and support associate at code monkey that picture you're looking at is the pre shutdown image of me before it became a caveman but and I am definitely happy to be here with you guys and I look forward to taking some of your questions in the chat box or in the Q&A Thank You Lena awesome yeah thank you and we also you'll see a picture here of Jay he is our curriculum developer so that means he develops all the lesson plans for our teachers and makes it really easy and selfguided for teachers student advocate our courses we also have one more member joining us from our team and that's Brett ethical sin so he is in ahead of all of our sales here at code monkey so he'll also be helping answer your questions as well I already see a question hi I'm new what do i do I just join you're just gonna hang out right now before we get started so you can this is for teachers and students as well obviously if you're over the age of 13 you should only be viewing these social channels here but we you can follow us on Twitter Instagram or Facebook I could Mike estu I do encourage you throughout this remote learning and copepod time that you tagged us using the webinar i'm the using the hashtag code monkey webinar and will retweet as much as we can all right so I always like to start off telling the story about code monkey I know many of you have probably heard the story before code monkey was developed with a team of three two brothers and their best friend they started teaching code monkey to students in the very traditional manner like learning like you would in college and they found that when they were working with younger students they just just like you probably didn't really like to learn coding that way so that's how code monkey was born and they developed they found that students really enjoyed coding with a monkey and learning how to code those coding concepts in a much more fun and engaging way so I hope you enjoy it as well all right so the today's objectives that we are going to be doing today is we're gonna work with some we're gonna do a quick unplugged activity so get those keyboards ready I'm gonna open up the chat here in just a couple of minutes and then we're gonna do a little bit of coding vocabulary will keep it pretty short here we'll do a couple of coding challenges just to get you guys familiar and then the rest of our time will be spent building a code monkey challenge as we get started if you get stuck and you're not able to see like if you're viewing on a tablet which can happen that way you can't watch zoom and be on a tablet at the same time so just kind of keep that in mind it's probably better to watch and then go back and do what you learned throughout the lesson today all right so just how patience with yourself and have an understanding that everything might not always go 100% but that's the joy of programming as there's always a time where you can fail forward so you can try again okay all right so our first activity and I'm going to open up this chat box for you here in just a minute and that's how do we make and eat a bowl of cereal so in the chat box I would like for you to place your steps in the chat box so walk me through how you would make and eat a bowl of cereal and then I will choose someone's I will choose some buddies to share with me so give me just one second screen okay so now I'm gonna let you guys take just a few minutes here and you guys go ahead and type in the chat box the chat box is now open for you to share this quick activity so we're gonna have to keep it pretty time crunchy here today so I'm gonna give you guys one minute to go ahead and give me the steps the best that you can typing in the chat box for how we would eat and how we would make an eatable of cereal see in some really great direction so I'm gonna set this timer here in just a minute you seeing some really really really great examples here of how you would make and eat a bowl of cereal you I also see some interesting answers here some of you are quite clever you all right awesome job you guys so I see some really great examples here I see somebody who said toss it up in the air and catch it I don't think that's how we would eat the cereal my guess is it would end up on the floor and your parents would probably be very upset with you um I do see this one get a fine your favorite cereal get a bowl spoon and milk pour the cereal in a bowl and then add the milk and then get your suit and start eating and make sure to clean up after yourself so that's a really great example see another one who says look for a really big bowl ooh I like this one here eat and then repeat the steps until empty drink them they'll wash the bowl and the spoon so all really really great examples you guys are amazing unplugged coders are ready so let's go ahead and let's see what an example of what that might exactly look like here so one example of this is that obviously in this one it says put cereal in a bowl but obviously we need to choose your cereal first before kind of getting started then when you get that you choose a bowl that you like I always have a very favorite cereal bowl that I like to use I don't know about you and my favorite cereal used to be Lucky Charms in which I would always eat the all the Lucky Charms first before I ate the rest of the cereal okay so you spoon you then you also get a spoon which is also not here in our directions but some of you are very specific and that is exactly the more specific the better when we're coding okay first step by step directions then I'm just going to repeat step three some the spoon the cereal and milk into my mouth and I'm going to repeat that until all the cereal and milk is eaten and then I'm going to rinse the bowl and the spoon okay obviously after everything is finished we're not just gonna we're gonna walk it back to the sink rinse it out and your parents will be very thankful that you washed out your bowl and put it in the dishwasher or washed it for your family make it a little bit easier always clean up after yourselves it's a good trait for yourselves later okay so that is an example of an algorithm number one and number two it's also an example of a loop in this case this is if you've ever done block coding which it looks like a lot of are very familiar with block coding that forever loop that you've used before when you keep doing something okay if forever loop is a little bit different but in this case it's a for loop so every single time I'm gonna keep repeating this step until there's no more cereal not going to keep going through the motions if there's no cereal but if I only have three pieces of cereal three little let's say little Cheerios in my milk it'll be easier for me to program that than it is for me to program it with a lot of cereal so that's why we would use a simple loop and we're going to work on using a simple loop today so a simple loop okay is called a times loop or an iteration it means the number of times that you're going to do it an iteration is a repetition of those steps so more so like when we're eating cereal continuously okay I see some people are saying that they're not able to hear me so if you can just raise your hand quickly so we can hear so that I know that you can hear me okay so it seems like quite a bit of you are sometimes it can be connected with zoom I don't know that it's really crazy busy right now with their threshold but if at any time you can't hear me please just make sure that you are indicating that in the chat box it just kind of lets me know because I can hear me but you probably can't hear me so that's always really good to know so thank you so much okay so I'm going to change the chat that you can only chat with us as panelists so just you know that's there okay all right so we have our simple loop and a times loop here so in this case when we talked about a serial that's called an iteration so something who loves this game raise your hand I love this game okay it really helps me sometimes when I've had a bad day to just be knocking those guys down okay but I also find it very fun so that is an iteration now if I only had three of them pop up I would be able to count the amount of steps and give it a times if I would be able to say there's three of them and I would hit one and then what's my next step I would hit the next and the next so there's a difference between a simple loop and an iteration or a for loop where something is happening all the time and I'm able to do it until the condition is met so in this case until all the rats are gone or I can just if I drop three pencils I'm able to easily plan how to pick those up so I can count three times okay so all really great questions I see happening here in the chat box as well we also talked about an algorithm okay so an algorithm is a list of steps that you can follow to finish tasks so just like a plan of action how you're doing it exact like when you're making chocolate chip cookies with your mom or baking or anything like that that's a really good example of a list of steps that you follow I know that I'm really bad at following recipes step by step and so I'll sometimes forget to whip the butter with the sugar beforehand and my cookies don't end up turning out very good so it's always really great to follow your step by step directions to complete a task and that's how the computer works it goes step by step in a very very very very fast right working through as it kind of goes through so that's very important okay so we worked through an unemployed activity together and now our next step is we're actually gonna go to coach monkey now lots of you if you're working on an iPad or some kind of tablet please don't try to do both it just isn't gonna work that well so I know it's probably not as fun but I would like for you to just kind of watch what we're doing and then you can go and try it afterwards okay so and I know that many of you have accounts if you're a teacher you can stay using your account but if you're a student please use the account that we're going to give you because it's going to behave a little bit differently all right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go to our code monkey website and so a member of my team is gonna pop down in the chat box there how do you get to code monkey and when you do you should see a web page like this so I'm in a browser you may use Safari or Google Chrome or Firefox or whatever it is that you have on there basically how you get to the Internet that's our browser so you're gonna open a new tab or open up your window and see that you can still have it's called toggling so when you have a couple of different screens or a couple of different windows we're looking between the two of those we're going to toggle between the two of those and when you're here if you can in that raise your hand just so I know that you're with me so I'm not moving too fast cause I know sometimes I can see very fast who you guys are on top of it today I really appreciate you guys following along with me it's very helpful okay so now that we're all here we're all gonna get logged in like I said if you're a teacher you guys can go ahead and log in and the rest of you you are going to use this username and the password so what you're going to do is at code monkey comm you're going to click up here on the right hand side and you're going to click login when you do this signin slash login box opens press ok login page and right here it says email a username you're gonna type this this here your username is monkey code 1 and your password is 1 2 3 4 5 6 obviously if you're doing this on your own you would not want to have such a simple password because we always have to be leery of hackers but in this case we're going to use this just today for this normally if you're working with my students we would have a much more difficult password than we have here never want to have something that somebody can crack super easy ok you guys are amazing when you are logged in raise your hand so I can we can go over the next steps together you guys are right on it with me okay Hannah remember when we talked about this about how if you have a question or you're stuck with something just make sure you can let us know it that well exactly you're stuck on it's hard for us to know what help means it can mean a lot of things so you have to be very specific with your questions just like if you were asking the teacher very specific questions awesome guys are rocking and rolling okay now I am going to get logged in so now I'm gonna do my username remember my username is monkey code 1 so I'm gonna type it here in the box oops making sure I spell stuff correctly or I won't be able to get in one key code 1 and my password is 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 ok if you don't have an account Hanna that's a really good question I can't get into the account because I have an account so you would need to log out of your account and use this username and password or try to go on your own account if it doesn't work then you'll know what ok so now what we're gonna do is we're going to review that simple loop because what we're going to do is we're going to build a simple loop in the challenge builder so we're gonna do two challenges together and then we're gonna spend our time the rest of the time building our challenge ok so if you can scroll down to coding adventure and when you click on coding adventure you click start coding you so you can just quickly turn all those songs off for me it just makes it a little bit easier okay I'm gonna talk about what you see here and then we're gonna scroll to our challenges so what we see here is our main screen or our code monkey course on the left hand side this is a stage F and on the right hand side is where we would script and write our code so our text editor okay Gordo is our teacher assisting it pops up for directions and when we want anything to work on the screen we're going to click the run however we're not going to do this challenge so what we're gonna do is if you can't see the story map there is a shortcut that I'll show you but this is where you're gonna go so you're gonna click on the story map which is right next to your little avatar here we're gonna click on the story map and each and every single world is a different coding concepts so we're going to scroll through till we get to the third map and the third map at the top says Lew plant okay and on loop land I want us to click on challenge number 22 if you don't see the storymap and maybe you're a little bit stuck okay I'm just gonna click off of Gordo for a second what I want you to do is I want you to come up here to the address bar and in the address bar you can change it from we are on challenge zero you can change it to challenge 22 and it's going to take you right here to where you need to be hands up if you are with me so I have an idea oh you guys are fast love my afternoon coders so it was easier to code after a nice lunch right okay can I see that you are there I'm hoping that you're with us on this okay you're not even just send a message to our panelists right okay so here I have Gordo again he's giving me those directions says the number you write before this function here which is the x function or x loop like we've talked about earlier is the number of times the code will repeat so I already have text here so anytime there's text on the screen we always want to debug it which means we want to find out if there's an error in the code so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click run like we did before and we're going to see something it tells us to count the bananas now there's a trick here sometimes people will hover over this last banana and say that there is a number eight so there's only eight bananas however on computers they actually start counting from zero so there's actually not only eight here there are actually nine bananas and we can count this so we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 so there's 9 bananas if we want to measure the distance we can take a ruler and we can pull the ruler out and hit go from the top we click one time on the monkeys head and we drag the ruler and we also see that the ruler not only does that but it also does angled measurements okay so you can see the measurements of the angles happening here so we saw that he was moving correctly he just wasn't moving before this number of times he wasn't moving the correct number of times so we have to change our time slip okay so this is going to say how many times do I want to run this line of code I could write this step 6 turn 36 and I could do that 9 times however I don't want to do it 9 times I want to get the shortest way possible Hannah if you already have an account you can just join us on challenge 22 and that will kind of help you as well okay all righty so we saw that we got a three star solution now I research Aleutian amines the shortest code that I could have bring if I had wrote step six 1036 every single time nine times I would have gotten at one star because it wasn't the shortest solution okay so I know you guys are with me on this I'm gonna do one more with you and that's gonna be challenged number 25 and then we're gonna build and create our own challenge so this one is important because we're going to rebuild something very similar to this okay so we're going to take a look here so we're gonna debug our challenge like we've done before and what we see here is that we don't really have a sequence we sort of have here we have two bananas and two bananas then two bananas and two bananas and we take the measurement of the bananas we want to check them we'll see that every single time the distance between each banana is five okay so that's important so we saw the monkey turn left when he got to the banana buddy just kept turning left three times and that's not exactly what we want to have happen okay so we have to see so we have one set 2 sets 3 sets and four sets okay so we're gonna change the number to four let's see if that makes a difference oh no he still didn't complete the sequence so when the monkey turns left we saw him facing that one direction now we want him to turn right okay and then remember we measured already the distance between each one so we can do step 5 okay and when we do let's see one now we have completed an algorithm okay and also a time slip so really great alright so now we have learned what a simple loop is now we're gonna go to our challenge builder so it's important that you follow along where we are okay and at the end of this my team will send out a challenge builder guide that will kind of help you guys I don't want to overwhelm you though right now with too much so right here in the code monkey in the left hand side we're going to click on the monkeys head or on the words code monkey that will take us back to our home page now what we're gonna do is we're gonna scroll to the bottom and if you don't if yours isn't at the bottom you're just gonna look for this picture that says challenge builder okay and what it is is it has a person with a banana and it's hand and you see a turtle in a rack so if you see that you're in the right place it will be under the creativity section okay so it's important so we're gonna click here on our challenge builder and I would like for you to click start coding and just to make sure that everyone is here I would like for you to raise your hand so that I know that everybody is with me and if you're not and you're not able to get in just please be patient and just kind of watch and learn from us and then you can try on your own later we'll make this recording available for you and your families alright and there are some people speaking Spanish unfortunately I don't speak Spanish so I'm not able to respond back to you and I don't have time to Google Translate right now or else I would love to do that okay alrighty so you guys are amazing and you guys are doing some really great work so remember you can always use that Q&A box as well if you have any questions so I'm glad everyone is with us okay and we'll kind of go through there alright so here we go so we noticed something automatically different gordo doesn't have any directions he hasn't said anything and the way that we would want to do that is we don't want to give the directions yet because we don't even know what we're doing okay so what we're going to celina we may ask you some questions here in a little bit so here's Gordo just like normal okay and we're gonna click on the okay and I'm just gonna talk about some functionalities here of the page so it's blink like it's not like the other ones that we've seen because we're gonna be building and creating our own challenge okay the roller is still here it still behaves the same the monkey is here the bananas here okay there's different backgrounds and this is why you're logged in like us today okay we're only going to use backgrounds that we've know so we only saw grass today so we're only going to use the grass okay then look we we click the plus sign there are different objects that we can add to the screen today we don't need to use any of those because we're just using the bananas and as these on your side of the student as you work through the challenges these little guys will unlock once you've been introduced to it okay and then the objects are open but you don't know anything about the objects yet so we won't use anything that we don't know so we don't have to do anything the next thing I want us to do is when you hover over these buttons here you'll see a little minus sign so we're gonna get rid of the minus I'm gonna get rid of the blocks and all we're gonna leave is the step okay button so raise your hand if you're with me and the only button that you see on your screen is the step great great great okay there's a rocking and rolling all right so now that we see that we're gonna click on this plus sign here and we're gonna use the buttons that we we know we've used before so we're gonna get the turn because we use turn we're gonna click it and it will go on to the bottom and then we're gonna find the time slip you'll see it's like a little almost like a recycle sign sort of okay and we're gonna click on that and we're gonna have it add it to the bottom and now we see step turn and the times look hey all very important all right great now this is my favorite part of the platform and hopefully maybe yours as well okay so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to show you this configuration is the behind the scenes things that you don't normally see on the program itself okay so every step is about 20 pixels so these this XY runs in pixels like computers ok so there's an XY coordinate right the monkey normally on an XY coordinate you would see a zero be somewhere in the middle okay but on computers and in the computer program it's actually up here at zero zero okay zero zero is in the upper left hand side of our screen so we're gonna put our monkey down here so truck so put your monkey down here in the right hand corner okay and we could see where the monkey is we can see if we move him around we can see his rotation I'm just gonna have him facing forward right now on the screen on our bird'seye view okay now we see our banana right now we only have one banana on the screen and we can see that we're moving it I want you to add three bananas well let's do four you all right now a trick here something to notice is that you want your the for banana so you want two of them to be on the same same Y court same ycoordinate okay and then you want them to be on the same and then we'll change the xcoordinate okay so here we have these two bananas so I can click on this banana I can move it and we can see that it's Y is at 343 so that means that I want this other one to also be at 343 you can also use the ruler okay to move it so just kind of keep that in mind as you're going through you okay that's fine Jackson if you can't find the turn no big deal if you see the left and the right that's perfectly fine nothing wrong with that we're gonna program it anyway so it won't be that big video just to help you if you get tricked up with spelling okay it's a great question all right so now we have those two and we know that there we know that they're on the right plane let's do the same thing let's check our other ones and let's make sure they're in the same place so I'm just gonna move mine action away a little bit extra banana there okay so now I'm gonna move this and I'm gonna put this one at y2 11 okay yours doesn't have to be exactly but it's tricky okay all right so that kinds of kind of gives us a little bit of idea if they're on the right plane or the right coordinate where we want them to go so think about it like the right line are they on the right line and are they even with each other okay I'm gonna get my ruler and I'm going to measure the distance first so we see that this one is nine and that this is six and the distance from this banana this one should be the same as the first one but it's not so we're gonna have to adjust it to make sure that that's the case we have this as being nine okay and then we can have this one as being six nothing wrong with that but we want this one to also be nine so that means that I need to move this one a little bit then it was before and I pick up the ruler and I'm so close so close okay and I measure and now you can see that it's night okay so we have six and nine okay so you can also see that I don't have it on the right right spot so I'm just gonna move it so it's even okay so now they're even with each other give me a hand in the air if you're with me you have four bananas and your bananas two of them arm the same ycoordinate and the other two are on the same ycoordinate as well and that just makes it a little bit even awesome you guys are doing great and I know my team is helping to answer those questions that you have any okay now we have that okay we have our back our back is done so we don't have to do anything here so you guys ready to the next step right now we have to go and code it so we have this year and our first step is we want our monkey to be able to step 6 like here so we can repeat this so we need to measure our monkey and move him 6 so that means I'm going to need to move him a little bit up here and so close you can see how sometimes when you're coding and coding adventure how sometimes it can seem like oh I use six one time and I use seven that time because it's really easy okay to be a little bit off by what just something normal okay so now we have that so you guys did awesome we have it kind of so now we're gonna coat it so how many times do we want to repeat this action so we know he's gonna go up and when he goes to the first banana he's gonna turn left when he gets here another banana he's going to turn right okay you okay so i seee the person was asking about spinach i'm gonna if you want to resend your message there is a person in this chat that can kind of help us a guide just like I said I'm not a Spanish speaker I wish I were but not not that cool alright so now we're gonna kotas and I'm gonna get my times loop and I'm gonna click on it once because I don't remember what the function was do I want to do it three times or do I want to do it two times we can try it with three times or I know that I have a collection of two steps so I'm gonna do okay and then what's the first thing that we did we have to make sure that it's inside the loop so this is nested loop that's why we don't have it this way because I think Peter won't realize that so the first step that we did is we said step six okay and then when we get to this banana what do we want to do we wanted to turn left okay and then step can't remember so I need to measure the distance it was nine okay so we're going to step nine 9 and then we're going to turn right and now we're going to test it so it may not work on the first time but that's the joy about coding right we're always failing and we're always doing better than we did the previous time oh so close okay step we got this first one okay so we step six he turns left and then he stepped nine and then six and then nine so now I'm going to look at my configuration and just see if there's something that maybe is a little bit off here you okay and then I'm going to rerun the code just because I wasn't paying that close of attention okay so I probably have an error Beach between the measurement of this banana and that banana just fine so I could change it to seven just in case and let's see if that makes a difference okay so sometimes so you can see it can be a difference of just one number in one direction or the other Gordo doesn't have anything here so we need to say something like whoa I don't know something well here like whoa oops and make sure your spelling and we're using correct capitalization and punctuation okay so woah you coded a simple loop great work because what's going to happen is that other people can actually see this and I click close now I'm not finished okay I need to also name my challenge so when we're naming our challenge we never use last names ever okay we can use a first name but it's always better to have a nickname but when you do a nickname it must be inappropriate okay so I'm just gonna do this here I'm gonna do monkey demo because I'm just settling for you and when I'm finished I'm gonna click the checkmark so I know that it's saved and I am finished with this challenge so I'll go over here to the right hand side I'm going to click save so that I know it's saved okay and then I'll click continue editing and then I'll walk you through that just one more time so if you can just stay with me here and then what you'll do is you can share it to your classroom or you can share it to our discover feature and that means that everyone from all across the world so some of you that are speaking Spanish you guys can share yours and Spanish or the language of your choice and you're able to share that worldwide with each other and you're able to remix each other's challenges and kind of work from there okay you can also do a link and when you do this link that means that you can share it anywhere okay like if you want to share with your family and say hey look at this really cool challenge that I just did today all right or you can even put it in a webpage or anything so let's do that again so we will name our challenge remember no personal names no nothing there just like a nickname you can use a first name just and we never use last names for privacy issues okay we click Save always saving our work and then I click continue winning and I can share it into my classroom if I would like and that would mean that other people can play it or I can just keep it private right now because I haven't really done much on my side of that or I can publish it worldwide now my team is going to send a challenge builder guide to you and that's just going to be something that's going to help you navigate building that so remember I use the configuration so the x and ycoordinates I looked at the different rotations that I had here you see the monkey was at a certain rotation there it wasn't rotated at zero okay and I made sure I had the same Y coordinates and it's easy to look between them to see the x coordinates as well it's a difference of 20 between each one each pixel okay so we build and we created the last thing that we didn't do though is we didn't give Gordo a message so here I would say you will need to use a simple number correct capitalization of tuition to solve this challenge I'm just gonna say don't give up try again okay so we always want to give some encouraging more words than making sure that that's where you're using digital digital citizenship you're always acting they're always using the right words and appropriate words when communicating worldwide with other people or they can see it alright so we are finished working through a challenge we talked about a simple loop okay if you get stuck you always want to ask a teacher a review basically any other challenges that you've worked through there's also super hints that the teachers will turn on so you can use super hints when you're stuck on the coding adventure courses themselves okay and now I'm gonna leave some time for questions because it's pretty quiet so if you have any questions it's open to all panelists and participants right now we can also pop it in the Q&A box while we're doing why you guys are thinking of questions I'm gonna share your results from earlier so hopefully you guys can see this how familiar are you with are you as with code monkey that's supposed to be how familiar are you coding as with code monkey you're a decent coder Facebook could hire you some of most of you are beginners are still learning which is exactly what you what you should be have you use code monkey before a lot of you have used it do you love to code and create yes so that's exactly what we would want for you to do and then the majority there's a couple people that are in third grade and there's one person in fifth grade sixth grade seventh grade and beyond and then we also have educator or might not even be one of those so I don't see any questions coming in so that's great or it could or could not be great so the challenge builder guide is there just make sure that you click on that if you have any questions or you're wanting to use a challenge builder I'm gonna leave this open for this afternoon so you can go ahead and keep working on your challenges and all of that kind of stuff is it okay to teach code monkey we have our beaver achiever courses that are really great for starting with both first and second grade I would recommend starting there first before doing the text based coding just because the textbased coding can get a little bit tricky beyond challenge 30 they can definitely do the first 30 challenges but beyond challenge 30 they start in variables I'm challenge 31 so sometimes that can be a tough concept for anyone to understand but most importantly for those younger guys but that's a great question okay I'm gonna keep moving here we will be doing some more webinars and things next week both for teachers and for students but if you missed anything they'll be up here there's a great game builder webinar that we did last week and some different things that we did with beaver achiever and things like that okay and remember that you can always contact us at info at code monkey comm or you can reach out to us on any of our social channels Facebook Instagram Twitter any of that kind of thing so remember to follow us and like us the guide is not hyperlinked I think you'll have to copy and paste it Brett would you be able to share that with them that link that I shared with you that is a hyperlink document and then remember while you were working with us today that we wrote some code we caught some bananas and we saved the world I'll send a followup email to our users with the challenge builder guide or you can just reach out to me at info at code monkey comm so I see some people are saying they're not able to get it so we'll send the followup email or we'll post it on our web page as well for you guys to use so thank you so much for spending your afternoon with us you guys were amazing coders and you did some amazing work today and remember to always have patience with yourself and that coding is never a hundred percent on the first try so thank you for writing code with us catching bananas and saving the world you guys have a wonderful day bye bye
