so we start computers in kindergarten and even with the little five year old we do some sort of coding everybody fooled us our opponent in December and then from there we build on those skills so I started to use code monkey towards the end of last winter the beginning of spring because I had heard about code monkey and I received an email about code monkey competition what I loved about code monkey was that the first 30 levels were open and this way every student in 3rd through 5th grade to go home and try the program the parents could look at it and together they could decide if it was something that they wanted to participate in I really like the different challenges that code monkey offered I felt that it was very basic at the beginning and the kids were able to build on the skills that they learned as they went through the competition the kids loved the different challenges they thought that they were amazing they could not wait until different levels opened up in the competition each week and some kids as soon as they got home from school they would spend hours on code monkey
