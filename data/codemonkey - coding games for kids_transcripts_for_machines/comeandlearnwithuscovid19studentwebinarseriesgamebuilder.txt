alright I'm gonna go ahead and get started we want to keep our schedule as well as we can if the first little bit we're doing be doing some introduction so people come in a few minutes late they'll be able to keep up with us welcome to this webinar about code monkeys game builder application code we have lots of great applications and resources but game builder is my favorite because it's openended and lets you build your own games and so that's the reason I'm talking to you about that this afternoon please stay in touch with us after the webinar following us at at code monkey s to you on Twitter our we're also a Facebook page you can search for us and you can access our blog on our main page W code monkey comm I am Jay Bloodworth I am the curriculum developer here at code monkey I've been in that position for about six months for that out of school teacher for twenty years so I do write lots of lesson plans and things like that and I have some of my coworkers with me to help facilitate this webinar let's start with mark mark if you'd like to introduce yourself hey good afternoon everyone as Jay said and as you can see there my name is Mark Dozier I am a customer success manager and support associate of code monkey also like Jay this is my favorite part of code monkey so I think you guys will enjoy what he has to share with you today thanks Jay and what not hi I'm the content developer of code monkey I've been with the company for almost for you and what I do is actually develop the courses that we have the challenges so I hope you enjoyed this webinar all right and Lena is going to introduce yourself and share a few guidelines for the afternoon's webinar hello my name is Leena Salah and I'm the professional development manager at code monkey I've been with the company for almost two years now and before that I taught in the classroom for about ten so thank you guys so much for joining us um some things that we kind of want to go over before starting our webinar today is that when you are sharing some comments and things in our both our Q&A and our chat box just remembering that we are still in a school type of setting so using appropriate language and that kind of a thing unfortunately if you're not able to use the appropriate language we will have to remove you from our webinar today so just making sure you're following those guidelines and once you are we'll be able to have a really great webinar and you're going to be learning a lot from Jay today so thank you guys so much thank you to Luna and Mark live not if I get a little bit carried away with my teaching in game buildings afternoon they're gonna be watching the chat and the Q&A to make sure that I don't miss any of your questions so I can address anything that you ask um so hopefully already know a little bit about code monkey we are a game based learning platform for teaching coding I think coding is fun no matter how you do it but we find that making a game out of it is makes it more fun for beginners sometimes but as I've said before while many of our products are about playing a game in order to learn the code today we're going to be writing and creating our own game and learning to code that way so that is even better so our agenda for this afternoon introduction which we pretty much already done talk just a little bit about some big ideas in game design and then the main events to me what is called a game jam game jam is usually an event where a bunch of coders get together in maybe small teams and work to create a game very quickly in a few hours from scratch we're gonna do for a modified Game Jam I am going to be leading it and kind of writing most of the code myself with maybe a little bit of input from you guys and I've cheated a little bit and then I've planned this out in advance um some more than you might see in a traditional game jam um but still it is going to be a very rapid in development process you can see how powerful the game builder platform is to let you do that and at the end we'll do some questions and answers and throughout I'll try and pulse when I can to answer your questions they come up in the middle just a couple of quick things or doing game builder their stuff logo we're gonna be doing the game builder application which is completely openended but code monkey does have three courses that go along with game builder so if you find that I move a little bit too quickly this afternoon for you you can go and do one all these courses and they will cover most of these concepts in more detail those are platformer sprite animations and Frogger and in a second you're actually gonna see this live this is the some screenshots from the game builder platform scuse me so you will know what to expect when we get in there um so let's actually go ahead and do that now so I would like to invite you to follow along with me oh I miss that you can do and write the code that I'm writing um if I'm going to quickly ask me to slow down but even if you have trouble keeping up the point of this is really for you to learn how to write your own game not just to duplicate my game so it's most importantly to get in the big ideas rather than just copying down exactly what I create so if you get a little bit lost that's okay um do we plenty of time for you to make your own game on your own and that represents what you like but let's try to do one together today so if you will go to WWE calm our main website give you a second to get there and we're gonna go to login and you behave your own username and password if you are already working with code monkey but if you don't if you're new to this you can use webinar webinar as both the username and password here o webinar actually I apologize the is zoom 42 I'm sorry you told me that and I forgot incorrect and zoom 42 again both username and password you go ahead and click login I'm just gonna wait in just a moment to make sure people are with me and you can choose if you like I left for right now and when you come here lots of things that are available but mostly if a lot cuffs um given password was just designed for using game builder you scroll down where we see creativity and game builder and we'll select that and we can go and click on start coding so before we get into it let's stop and look at this for a second um there are some options here that give you some prebuilt games or some games early starting points for your own your own ideas I've already to choose the one that doesn't include any starting code we're building completely from scratch we're going to click select default and click select but from this default game we're gonna go ahead and make some changes the default game is kind of designed to be like a platformer game like Super Mario you can kind of see the background here looks like something you might see in that kind of game and we want to change it to be something more like pacman I see a question here Pamela so for this afternoon to participate in the webinar you can use the zoom 42 username and password otherwise you do need to have a subscription we're offering those free deer in the Ovid 19 crisis and I think one of my panelists can talk to you about that if you need more information so um as I was saying we want the back a kind of a different kind of game we romantic like a pacman game so we need to make some changes this default to do that we need to come to the game tab this is on the right at the bottom and first thing pick a different background none of these are just perfect for a pacman game there is the option to upload your own but to keep things simple let's just pick this one that looks kind of like a star field that'll do and then the other thing we need to change um in a game like Super Mario Brothers that involves jumping up and down it makes sense for there to be gravity we've got gravity in the game world the game itself handles things going up and down but for a pacman or a pacman like game you can move in any direction there is no gravity we need to turn that off or we're gonna just turn gravity down to the next thing we need to add for a pacman like game pacman is running around in a May if we want to create some boundaries of the game world and then add some walls and such do that we're going to use the paintbrush tool which allows us to add tiles to the screen that act as obstacles um any of these tiles would work they all work the same way they just look different um since FIFA supposed to represent walls I'm going to use this brick texture and then just click and drag to draw around the edge of the screen we're on all four sides there's one little issue here in that on the upper right corner of the screen where the toolbars actually are I can't draw here because the toolbars in the way there's a way to get around that so our game world right now is 600 units wide which is what we actually wanted to keep but if I temporarily make it wider I can then use this tool a little crosshairs tool you shift things over now I can use the paintbrush in this drawing in world boundaries then back and then set the world width back 200 okay still that the pretty boring maze so I'm gonna go ahead and add some additional walls to it I'm going to do this one here do not mean to draw it there I'll fix that in just a second use the eraser tool now we can make this a little more interesting in complex if you wanted to but just keeping things fairly simple for a beginner game that's a decent little maze or our guy to run around it have a little guy to run around in it yet but that's coming very soon but I've been talking for a long time so let me just pause for a second and see if there are any questions that I can address before we get into actually making a game out of this thing all right not see anything any pop up if any do in the next minute or two I'll often talk about them so to actually make a game we need some characters and some goals for those characters to work towards and in a game like this the characters represented by were called sprites rights are the thing from the screen that are active and that that do stuff it could be the main character it could be the bad guys it could be goals and powerups that mean characters grab anything kind of interactive so these walls are not considered sprites because they're not interactive although they do but the other things that are interactive are called spikes we need to add a sprite represent our main character do that we go to the sprites tab we click plus and we choose we think we want um we've got some code monkeys we've got a monkey Valentine's game food a tiger some different animals for this I am going to choose the Hedgehog or two reasons one cause hedgehogs are cute and two because I've already practiced making this game with a hedgehog and there's one little thing but it really matters which sprite we choose and I know that it already works with the hedgehog so but if you're making your own game you can choose whatever you want they work the same way they just look different on the screen and our different sizes possibly and it's because of the size of them making Sarada you've got the movement tool there the flector tool I can move the hedgehog for not standing on the wall and there we go now there's still one little issue with this and again I only know this cause I've practice making this game you can feed the hedgehog fits between the walls but only just barely we're gonna see that when we start moving the hedgehog when he gets about here he stays the size he's not gonna have room to turn and move up and down weird actually have to make the hedgehog into a slightly smaller character and do that we have to start coding notice that when we added the hedgehog we got a screen over here they would Hedgehog you sprite has its own code associated with it but we're gonna write right now just one line of code associated with the hedgehog to make it smaller um the code we need to write is set scale set scale makes the sprite bigger or smaller it takes one input one argument number it's a number bigger than 1 it makes the object bigger more than 1 it may need the hedgehog to be a little bit smaller so I'm gonna use a number other than 1 and again I only know this because I practice with this before 6/10 is a good number set scale to 6/10 I ought to point out this at symbol in CoffeeScript the language that we're using to write this game at symbol refers to the object that were editing so accent scale means set scale or the Hedgehog we could if we had other sprites one functions that relates with other sprites but the @ symbol means this function applies to the target scope or editing hedgehogs so we finally have some code we can run although it's not gonna be that interesting but we see that when the code runs that does actually give us the Hedgehog and make in a little bit smaller they didn't fit between the walls but that's it for right now there's no interactivity it's just look at the hedgehog in the maze wow that's really exciting we can do better than that we're gonna stop the game and we're gonna start to add some more code so we do that I need to talk to you for just a second about eventdriven programming when you write a game you can't do what maybe you learned about in computer programming before where every command goes in order because you don't know what's gonna happen in what order you don't know whether the players gonna go left or right first or up or down or game with jumping jump you need to be able to respond to what the player wants the characters to do when the player wants them do it so we need to write our code in a different way what we need to do is respond to events events are things that happen either in the game world or inputs that the player sends to the game world tell what they want to happen and so we're gonna write code that says when this event happens do this when this other event happens this other thing and that way the game will run the right code at the event we want to respond to to control our Hedgehog the on key event you go to the events tab underneath the code window here there's a button for own key which gives us a little snippet of code that'll help us get started writing the function to control our hedgehog so on key it's the name of the event and they call this funk and there's the variable here that says this function takes an input that input represents the keyboard key that was pressed and a give the example here how you can use that to make a decision inside the function the if statement if the keyboard key that was pressed if equal to you have to use a double equal for this right arrow key right now it says step 1 which would tell the hedgehog to take one step forward we're actually gonna need to change that because we won't right there so that controls the hedgehog to go in any of the four directions which means the first thing we need to do when a keyboard key is pressed is face the right direction so instead of saying step one use a different function set rotation zero rotation is measured in degrees and in the convention and game builder zero degrees is me oh if the keyboard key if the right arrow key is pressed the hedgehog is gonna face to the right we hadn't had to move yet well if we won't cover all our bases we need to consider all four possibilities so if the keyboard key is the left arrow I'm gonna ask you to think if zero degrees means go to the right what degree measure will tell the hedgehog to face to the left you can answer that in the Q&A that would be great or in the chat we have the chat open yes Michelle good job 180 degrees okay since 180 degrees facing the opposite direction all right what about if we want the hedgehog to face down how many degrees we rotate that's correct 90 I'm business actually a little bit different than maybe you've encountered in your math class you know what grade in what level of math you're doing I'm usually we think other natural counterclockwise but in game builder a positive degree manager if a clockwise were any grief clock wife goes from white and then of course we have to do up so what would it be and once again Michelle has it it's 270 means double check sometimes when I'm writing this code I forget single equals which makes things work not right at all but I think I spelled everything right now we won't need to do a little bit more than this because if we left it like this all happen is the job would Faye from the right direction but he wouldn't move we need one other command which is at step let's say 10 and notice that's not underneath an if though that's gonna happen no matter what he was pressed hey whoa you're gonna face in the correct direction and then move a little bit and as long as you hold down that key keep facing that direction oh let's run this code and see look here now we can actually control a hedgehog with him around pretty easily unless the walls do block him another one if he can move around freely so now it's starting to look a little bit like a game but we probably want to add some kind of goal or our hedgehog reach for so again with you me kind of like pacman let's scatter some things around playing field for the Hedgehog to grab do that we're gonna need another sprite on so I'm going to open up the add sprite again and here I'm gonna let you guys cheese probably it should be something maybe not an animal but an ax or chocolate or one of these other smaller things but what's there a hedgehog goal B what should we what fright should we use as the object of the head body has an opinion scare it in the chat firstly I like chocolate but I'm willing to be flexible don't ask pineapple I don't know if hedgehogs like pineapple let's assume they did alright well mark we've already chosen the pineapple so I'm gonna stick with this for right now let's put it down here where it's a little bit of work you worthy it's hard to get to and then let's just see what happens when mmm something but not much notice the Hedgehog did not pick up the pineapple he pushed it a little bit I didn't pick it up that's because the game doesn't know we won't the Hedgehog to pick up B we have to write some code to make that happen and our Co doesn't have to deal with another type of event oh no I'm talking about eventdriven programming earlier I said events could be things that the player does like pressing a key they can also be things that happen inside the game like two sprites colliding with each other so in order to do that in this game I'm going to edit the code or the pineapple and add a collision handler to that so notice right now codes the Hedgehog is still there I'm gonna be editing the code for the pineapple grenade here is the unclad and the own collide function it's called when the event is sprite the editing collides with another sprite and we have to give the name of that sprite here well the name that's right is Hedgehog that we want something happen when the Hedgehog and on top run into each other the pineapple well Rachel even do a couple things eventually but at the very least we won't be Hedgehog to pick up the pineapple which means the pineapple needs to here we can do that by pulling the destroy function which does just what it is choice is bright and the at it's very important here remember at nîmes this sprite that's why we're editing so at destroy means destroy the pineapple hedgehog bad if the hedgehog got destroyed we need to find Apple let's see if that works we on this Hedgehog over here this time when he touches the pineapple on ambled if it looks more like a game oh poor Toph we can still improve on it most games have some kind of ring mechanisms let's add a score increases and being pineapple represent the score with a new kind of object fair game not a sprite a widget in game builder widgets or object to the pier on screen a part of the user interface do you the widget code a counter which this represents a number like a score add that new screen you get a little window where we can change the name I'm gonna change the name from counter score notice also that the counter has its own code window here in that code window there's a little bit of code already at value when we're at means me think I'm editing so value of the score widget is equal to zero carding score to be zero let's another thing before we wore code let's move this score up so it's on the screen and now to actually have the player earn a score when the pineapple gets picked up you can go back to the code for the pineapple back stripes and select pineapple and right now we've got one command in this function order to add a new command core value right using that symbol here because we're not affecting pineapple object were affecting a different object the score object not values is the value part of that and this is gonna look a little bit weird but it's just part of the syntax of CoffeeScript less equals says take a variable and add a number to what's already there oh this command score dot value plus equals let's say 100 we'll add a hundred points to the score each time that it gets called so from 0 to 100 but if we add more pineapples each one will add a hundred oh that's all the code we need there we can just run it and you're on the score pick up the pineapple this time hi Jay I think you can I hope you can hear me we're not able to hear you but your game is looking amazing while Jay is figuring his sound out there for a second I'm gonna launch a little quick poll for you guys see how just a question about game builder so I hope you take a couple of minutes and we're just gonna take this quick poll and everyone is going to be able to both thank you know you're sat yep we can hear you can everybody see the pool all right see if you have boated challenge yeah so allowed to vote as well oh yeah game sounds awesome all right very awesome okay we're gonna end the poll and then I'm gonna hand it back off to Jay so there you go right um so I don't know if we saw there that I did pick up the pineapple that it made a little sound let me do it one more time real quick or if my sound was out then the last thing I wanna do here is I mean there's a lot more than we could do but all day long the last thing I want to do here is okay most games like this you don't just pick up one pay it gots names we're going to add some more pineapples around the screen and to do that well I have to do these steps all over again but actually there's a shortcut we go to sprites and select our pineapple from this little gear here unless it's edit from things including name and and some other things about it we also get this duplicate button ok the pineapple and any code that goes along with it which means this new pineapple that I created act just like the old pineapple looting like a found getting destroyed and adding to our score when it gets picked up and a pineapple every duplicate several times here dosqueen though more time now I should be able to collect all five of those pineapples and they work exactly like when we created maximum score so that's kind of what we're gonna stop for today now you could do a lot more of this you could add enemies to it good add other things to collect that from out for points or gay different powerups on birds in this game that I created one time had a tunnel that went from one side to the other all those are things that dude in the more exciting game now be sure based on when I've talked to you so far this afternoon if you don't have programming already it might be hard to do new things I want to give you mention two tools that you might use to help yourself and then take any questions that you have when is right move screen these little index card looking things are reference cards describe all of the programming concepts and functions you can use and build on key bits describes how own keywords and using sample to implement your own the other tool is available to you is remember I mentioned there are three courses that go a game bill or walk you through the building of three different games step step one is a platformer tie game from a Mario one a Frogger game it's a little bit similar to what we've created here and then one so you had to do animated sprites hedgehogs little feet move when we when he moves animation great animations like that on your own so I am gonna kind of finish up here and pause or stop for questions and that was wrapped up we will wrap up the webinar for the afternoon are there any questions they're pretty small crowd this afternoon so stand not be a big pile questions there for anybody that's one gets answered if not do you have any questions you could ask Jay no I think he did a pretty amazing job I was saving the reference column to last but he also mentioned that song definitely reference cards are buying saving grace I know that for me all right well as we're closing up and again if I think of a question in the next minute or two pipe up and I hole I'll answer it Michelle absolutely right score value of minus equals with deduct points from there actly correct any other questions from yours again as you're thinking let me just say a couple closing thoughts I say I created my game here the real power of this is you need to create your game I heard about this one you might wear that and add some things I don't want to start with your own from scratch I did all like this kinds of backgrounds I suggest you know there could be space games or racing games or flappy bird or flappy pig type game that we've created lots of possibilities what you can do with games over so please let your creativity inspire you but if there are no other questions I think we wrap things up for the afternoon I want to thank everybody who participated and and asked and answered good questions and hope you all continued using code monkey products that you will with us for any of our future there are any our panelists have anything to say before we shop is there any like info like how to contact us on the on your side day yeah there's email addresses um okay if you guys have any questions regarding anything about the game builder you can reach out to us at info at code monkey calm and be sure to follow us on all of our social channels we also want to see what you're doing and how you're utilizing remote learning into your classroom so be sure to tag us so we can share out what you're doing as well with our users so thank you guys so much and thank you so much to Jay for hosting remember to write code or write code catch bananas or in this case catch pineapples and save the world do you guys have a wonderful day
