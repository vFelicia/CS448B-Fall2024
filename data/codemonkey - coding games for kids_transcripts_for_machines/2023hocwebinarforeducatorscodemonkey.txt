then next we also have here is livette and I'll go ahead and let her unmute and introduce herself as well hi everyone my name is livnat I'm um the pedagogy and content developer at Codman um responsible for creating some of the hour of code that Lauren will present today uh and I'll answer any question relating to content or whatever else uh that you have thank you so much lat so first also um Jonathan Shore our Code Monkey one of the founders and CEO he wanted to be here um today this afternoon but for him it's 10 o'clock at night um so I have a little video instead for him that I'm going to play for you hello my name is John sh and I'm the founder and CEO here at COD monkey Studios thank you for joining us today for the hour code webinar for 2023 we hope that you and your students enjoy our free code monkey course offering next week to celebrate the annual hour of code coding boosts problem solving skills improve computational thinking encourages persistent teacher creativity improves confidence and communication skill as well as help to prepare children for the future although many Educators provide time for students students to code during this celebratory week it is important that we give our student the opportunity to code year round as well we hope that you join us next week to expose your students to our engaging coding courses as well as consider joining us year round with a subscription happy coding sorry also um well thank you Jonathan even though he's not here right now um he just wanted like I said introduce himself um as well as tell you a little bit about code monkey and his passion for coding and the importance of coding and not only next week for hour of code but also like we said year round um at any time if you want to stay up to date on all the latest information on all things codemonkey be sure to follow us on all of our social media Outlets um they're all at codemonkey s you and we'll share this slide Deck with you later um through the chat um as well as also um later within if you're watching the recording we'll have this in the description and you can click on any of these links if you want to directly to take you to Twitter or X Instagram Facebook or LinkedIn um and you can follow us um there and start tagging us as well um so please do make sure you do that like I said we post daily so to kind of stay up to date on Code Monkey and all of our offerings um it's a great idea to follow us there so let's take a minute and look at our webinar outcomes for today um like Molly mentioned she'll be and livnat as well kind of Manning that Q&A although we reserve time at the end for Q&A please feel free at any time there at the bottom you have that tool that says Q&A and you can type in your questions there and we'll try to answer them as we go but we do have that designated time at the end um I'm really excited because yes we'll talk about the hour of code and the importance of coding um we'll look a little bit at code ny's Journey um and where we've kind of come and who we are um but we're going to kind of release or share with you our free courses as well as really highlight our new AI as a hoot which is the AI pose detection and so I'm really excited about that today to share that with you and how it works we'll do a couple of the exercises together so you feel comfortable with using it with your students um and then we'll kind of finish up with a little bit of guidance about how to prepare for hour of code in your classroom um whether might also be your school if you're a school leader or maybe you're a district leader and so you might need to prepare um that way as well so let's look a little bit at what hour of code is I cannot believe but hour of code actually started in December of 2013 so this is now the 11th year for hour of code which is absolutely amazing that we're providing our students this opportunity each year and we have now for 11 years um so what the hour code is if you're unfamiliar is that free opportunity that's hosted each year to provide kind of like an introduction to computer science and it's always done through those fun activ activities and also our of code has videos for Learners and it's at all skill levels because they know that some students get this opportunity just this once a year um some have it all during the year which is great and it's Incorporated so um they can kind of get started any way that they need to it just that right level for them um this year's celebration I think it's Unique even though I've participated many years because um yes we have coding but also AI is supported because we know AI is our world right now um so that theyve Incorporated that as well just like you see that our new course AI zahoot is in there as well um but also we have 400 Partners this year 20,000 Educators have already signed up and then also 58,000 volunteers as well um and then also 180 countries are already signed up to participate and this is a kind of a neat graphic to kind of look and see how many people plan on next week participating in that hour of code so really cool so let's look at a little bit more about we have a promotional video about what the hour of codee is I'd like to share with you right now um but also keep in mind that this video is um on our YouTube channel um which can also be found in the description notes of this slide um so that you can follow us or add us there our Channel on YouTube and you can show this to your students next week other teachers um anyone in your District that might not know what hour of code is to help to explain to them so let's check out this video hey guys I bet you're wondering where I'm going today well we're all going to this special event and you can join in too you know they say a thousand monkeys with a thousand years can write the works of Shakespeare but we're not going to write Shakespeare we're going to write code because every year in December we get together it's called hour of code it's a worldwide event where teachers and students in 45 different languages across more than 180 countries come together to learn computer coding it's a chance to understand how the apps and Tech we use every day are made it's a chance for the next generation of Engineers and programmers to get a head start on all the wonderful things that we'll create I'm talking about you I know it looks a bit scary at first but don't worry you don't even need to know anything about coding yourself because code monkey has selfguided tutorials for you to choose from you've got everything you need to make your own games and applications and don't worry if you don't have your own computer you can even share equipment to make things together it's really good for team building we've got so many cool things to do for all ages can create a chat lot you can create your own physics you can make games about catching bananas you can even help my friend Bieber do all sorts of things and it's all free and there are short courses and big courses and there are even bigger challenges if you want you can do it your way however long you want how you want but even where you want and you don't even have to be a kid even adults can start learning how to c anyone can sign up and be part of the fun so do it today and get ready for December who knows where your adventures will take you what you do during the hour of code is up to you and there are so many possibilities that I know you'll make something great it's so easy even a monkey could do it please like this video share with your friends and don't forget to subscribe to our Channel thank you for watching like I said um this video is great for explaining to other Educators but also you can pull this video up and share this with your students next week if you want um here in just a second Molly's going to throw the slide deck Link in the chat um so that you can access it um and then also within that slide deck link um look for our YouTube channel link directly so that you can find this video and use it as well um so I hope you enjoyed that and like they said um the hour of code it's great because all level of Learners can use it it's that great exposure um whether you're computer science teacher and you are using coding every day or you're a classroom teacher and you only use it once a year for hour of code um we have resources that I'll show you here in just a minute to help you feel comfortable so that you can get started see you hey guys so let me take a moment just to tell you about Code Monkey as we have many participants here on um this webinar whether you're live or watching later and some of you are awesome existing customers and you know Code Monkey you love Code Monkey but some of you are potential new users here today and so I want to tell you a little bit about code monkey and what kind of sets us aside from some of the other subscriptions out there um so first we are are that leading kids program provided we provide an engaging online course um for students to learn coding um what's really neat about us that I think really sets us aside um is it was designed with schools and teachers in mind because it's easy to use um we have a informative student teacher and administrator dashboard so that you can fully see all of our courses access the resources monitor your students progress um to help you know provide next steps for them and so it's not just a a website where you assign courses and classes um it's very intentional um and so that students um are progressing at just the right level and you're pushing them even Beyond um it is standards aligned both with csta or computer science teacher Association standards and ISTA standards as well um and then we also have alignment documents for individual State Standards upon request so if that's something you're interested in we can provide that as well of how each and every one of our courses align with your individual state standards um also we are different because we're a full k through eight coding curriculum so we have that full curriculum that and actually I say you can use it free Cas I've used it with preschoolers all the way into High School depending on where your um students are kind of at with their coding skills um also there within the description or the speaker notes um you can find our full scope and sequence document so it's kind of like a curriculum map to show you which courses we recommend you use with which grade levels and um how they're used and then last but not least and there's no prior coding experience needed to teach it so um our Founders and CEOs we they know that they built this because they know teachers don't always have the background um in coding we're classroom teachers and we might have special ed backgrounds and we might have literacy or math backgrounds um but at times it's mandated and we want to provide our students that opportunity um so you don't have to have background knowledge and we have full resources full lesson plans on our website to help you every step of the way um so that you feel confident to teach that so that's just a little bit about Code Monkey who we are what our subscription is and like I said kind of what sets us apart from some of the other providers out there so let's get into the meat of our webinar today um let's look at our 2023 I'm really excited to announce this hour of code course um courses and also activity offerings um you will see here we have 12 courses or sometimes we call them activity offerings this year for you um and then just released here as you can see is our new AI is a hoot pose detection that I'm going to actually guide and walk you through here in just a moment as well um I'm really excited I said there's 12 1hour courses that are free um that includes our new but that's really two over 207 challenges and over 12 hours of content you could use technically next week with your students if you wanted to so let's look at some people prefer to act access our courses and our resources directly through the hour of code site and if you want to do that that's perfectly fine um so how you can do that is you can go and this is all linked it'll be in the slides for you you can go to the hour of code website and then I do recommend if you are going to participate go ahead and click here for educators and hosts that they can document and see that um you are also participating to kind of get that track record so you can click there to access all of their resources also if you want to specifically find well how can I filter and find just Code Monkey um you can come here through activities and filter it um and let me click and show you how to do that so you can click here go to the our code website like we said um you can come to activities and once you're here on activities and you scroll down um they have R RS through if you come down to either you can come through code bunky here or they also have us as the the new one Code Monkey studio so they did kind of separate us into two but you can find most of our course offerings here through the hour of code website if you would rather come here that is one way you can get to it now in my opinion where else can you find us go directly to our website I truly feel like um this is the easiest way and the most efficient because you're going to get additional courses if you come through our website all 12 of them all of our resources the certificates all the things will be from right through here also you can send your students here as well um to access these courses so um I do want to kind of also emphasize yes these are available and we are really showing them today um but also these are actually available all year long either with your free teacher trial you can sign up for a paid subscription or just a guest from this marketing page you can access this actually year round so I did want to showcase that as well so let's um actually go into and let me show you so you can come here to our codem monkey.com website and then SL hour of code um and I'm going to click on it here for you so here we are if not if you went to codem monkey.com under resources and then hour of code this will also directly take you here um and then it's important that you scroll down so it's going to give you that video also if you want the video directly from here tells you a little bit about hour of code how it works but this is where you can get to all 12 of our courses and get started playing um this is a great way to kind of look and just see well what what is it for um what's it called who is it for is it block based or text based or is it python um and then also gives you a little um brief explanation but where the meat is is when you click on so let me click on Code Monkey Jr you can come here and as you can see you can start right here and you can start playing you do not have to sign up and your students can click here or you can sign up for a free trial and if you want to be able to have access to the full lesson plans as well as track student progress and have the saving as well this week next week um but from here you can like I said there's a million places to find information or start playing but it will also tell you a little bit more about that particular course so how many levels What age we recommend Concepts they'll be using if it's block based text base and python here's where you can find teacher notes um so that's really helpful to help inform yourself as a teacher to be able to explore it ahead of time and um so you can click there and then it'll walk you through even deeper more of an overview specifications and how to get started specific steps certificates can be found here um frequently asked questions if you have questions about this particular course um you can find that and yet again if at any time um you want your students to be able to save that um you can sign up for a free teacher trial for 30 days it does not require any type of information um like a credit card or anything to get started you just need your teacher email and you can log in by creating a password or using your single sign on you already have and you can get started so I highly recommend you take advantage of that especially if you want to use it for hour of code go ahead and sign up today or this week so you can start exploring your teacher dashboard and you can assign those courses so students can sign in next week and save their progress as they go okay so let's get back to here we go our new offering which is AI zahoot so I would like to spend about 10 the last 5 to 10 minutes in wall o have time for a Q&A if you have any questions at the end um looking at our new offering that we're allowing everyone access to um as you can see there's livat there um using the pose detection um to program um Oliver the ow so let's take a look and talk about this new offering so this course it's really neat because it allows students to use their webcam to train that AI model and then you use those poses to get all over the ow between obstacles to get to the end of his route um so you do have to have a webcam on the device to be able to be successful on this um we do recommend you use it for ages 8 through 12 but with support or partnering them up I think you could use it at a younger um grade level the it is nine exercises so it is kind of on the shorter end I would say it took me a solid at least 30 minutes as an adult who was kind of comfortable with coating um to get through it so kind of gauge your time maybe as a teacher practice it you know your students better than anyone else so that you can kind of see how long that might take or if you're signing in what would be great is you could use this all week long this student progress would be saved um it is using block coding um so that's something that is that lower level that help make students successful um and then something to definitely note is I want you to know that um all the images used to train the models are not stored and it's safe for student use so it is Copa compliant so um please don't worry about that we make sure that um we are Copa compant so that um it is safe for all of our users both teachers and for students so let's go ahead and take a moment and look at the first three exercises I'm going to go kind of fast but I want you to feel comfortable so that you can get on and explore it in case you do want to use it with your students next week so let me go ahead and this is a direct link to it but like I said you can find it right through our website and it's also available on that hour of code website as well so let's come on in here um to AI zahoot as you can see um like I mentioned this course is block based um it's nine exercises total um each exercise um it's great this over here I like to call this first section kind of the overview section with the instructions um it's great because it shows students what exercise they're on um there are great builtin accommodating features like you can listen if you'd like um but it gives students an overview of um kind of setting up the stage of well you know who is Oliver what are you going to be doing what's your task here in this course um and then it has an example videos instructions as well as it checks every single step of the way and can give them hints as well and so it's very user friendly um we develop this because we know a AI is our world and it's hands on AI with pose detection so students actually get to train the program and recognize as the poses to play the game at the end so um it's really neat I think you'll really enjoy it as well as your students um so let's take a second and get started um so as you can see here's the overview like I said here's that listen button I'll quickly click on it it's going to be an exciting M so that you can hear it but you can also click stop if you don't want to use that anymore and students can read um and then I'm going to skip down here to save us some time so also a feature I love about our courses is when it gives you a a command it also color coordinates it down here um within the second section this is the code editor so that when they the library of blocks they're categorized by color so that they're easy for students and for teachers to find um and then it also refers to that color over here in instructions so I think that's very helpful that you'll enjoy that and then this third section is the game area um where when we click run and its time it actually runs the game as well as it's the host there for the the tabs like the Sprites widget sounds in the games so let's get started so my first instructions as you can see it's very userfriendly like I said I could play it but I'm just going to quickly read it so let's start with moving Oliver it starts kind of very basic and moves students up and progresses them so it's asking me to drag the step block which is already here from the movement Library so if I was not in the movement Library it tells me to come here and prompts me to click on this tab and then attach it to that onrun block which is already there um within the code editor and you heard that little click I hope and then I can check yay so um very rewarding it lets students know great just very small steps it makes them feel successful I've been confident as a learner so now I can click on run and see what happens and then it says click on stop and hopefully you heard that um sound again so it lets me know I've completed that they're green and it's moving me on so now all are barely moved um we need to to keep him moving though so let's remove this step block and put it back um drag a loot block from the control so yet again the control is color coordinated for me so I need that loot block and I'm going to attach it to the on run and then I can drag a step block from the movement Library still guiding me one step at a time attached it perfect now as a learner I'm ready to check there we go now click on run yay I've moved them over here great job so that is the first exercise and it'll tell them great job and prompt them to go to the next so let's look at the second exercise here so this is where we're going to get to do the pose detection which I really wanted to get into to show you how it works um so we're have to create the AI model to be able to then use it later um so let's go ahead and create it so it says click add new model over here I have to give it a name I'm going to call power code webinar just real quick um and like I said you have to have a webcam for this and so when I'm ready I need to and I it is also case sensitive and um spelling as well counts so if name the first one raise hands it does need to be typed in exactly how you see it so it gave me that check because I spelled it correctly and had lowercase as well um and then now when I'm ready um this is where we need to use the webcam so it says click on record okay it might prompt students the first time I've used my webcam before here um but as you all know as Educators um you might need to help support students um with accepting using the webcam so you may need to do that so here I am um so I've clicked there um now I need to click on record and the timer icons I'm going to turn that on because it's helpful if you have to back away for the next one and then when I click to record it's going to take pictures I need to raise my hands and move a little little bit so that it gets versions of my pose so I'm going to be ready and that's why that timer is on just in case students need a second to prepare I'm going to kind of move around and it so you can see it's getting those samples raising my hand so that the computer can detect that so I've got my samples I'm good and gave me a check now I'm going to name the second one here stand same thing the spelling and capitalization matters and now I need to back up and stand that's why that also that timer is helpful um so I'm going to click on the timer icon I did it I'm going to click to record I'm going to start backing up I'm going to stand straight it says and try to move a little bit to make many versions of my pose so I'm going to stand up there we go and then kind of move around a little bit so it's detecting as you can see all of my samples till it stops okay 178 that should be good going to move back up here Lauren you actually um uh recorded on the same class instead of the one on the then oh ah thank you so much livnat she's right I did not come back down here thank you so I can it's a great teaching point right that happens I'm going to remove all these samples raise my hands again so it doesn't get confused right thank you livette and that would have happened to students so I'm glad that was a perfect teachable moment thank you for unmuting okay there we go so now I have my 102 samples of my raising hand great now in stay and I need to record thank you so much now I'm going to back up again I'm going to try to stand up and get myself in the view I'm GNA move around a little bit there we go and now I got the check there we go so now I'm ready to train the model so I have to click train this might take a second so I'm going to go ahead and click train as I talk and so now it's taking those images and like I said those are um they're being into vectors so it's not it's Copa compliant not saving for students not traceable as you can see it's training it I click train yay and I can preview them if I want but for time I'm just going to say save yay so now I'm ready so it's a great job I'm ready for exercise 3 which is actually using this and I know we're getting towards the end of the webinar we have like two minutes so I'm going to quickly show you how this works um on exercise 3 and then take us back to our slides and then you can have fun exploring the rest of the exercises so um I have to choose the model so this was the webinar click check add the webcam widgets I'm need to come over here add I'm going to add my webcam wedget here and it says drag it up here so it's kind of out of the way of the game um and then I need to click on my ow so now I've got my Sprite owl now I'm coding the owl I need to do my on prediction and change it to raise hands it's already there go ahead and check drag my jump block from the movement Library I'm show you how it jumps and then there we go okay let's click run and now there we go I can use my hands come on Oliver get up there there we go so that's just kind of to let you see how that works so there's exercise three all right let's go on back for time so like I said it gets more complex and it allows you to add a third pose later um to use and play the game at the end which is really fun for everybody so I really hope you enjoy that so last but not least let's look at our final outcome of that guidance on preparing for hour of code um you know your students the best um you're with them every day so decide on their level is this the first time they've ever seen coding so do you need to start lower with a course like Code Monkey Jr or Beaver achiever or is it to advance their skills are they ready for AI as a hoot are they ready for banana tails with python so you kind of decide always always like all teachers over play I know they do plan ahead so if you want to use the courses um with saving you need to go ahead and sign up that 30day free trial um the next coming day so that you can decide how you want students to sign on to be or to log in um to be able to save their progress if not that's fine too then you can go directly to our hour of code website or um also through our Code Monkey site and students can play without saving that's fine do you have enough to devices if not do they need to share um how will you pair them up what other equipment might you need um is it going to be loud do you want them to have headphones um do they need a mouse if we're doing some text Bas coding a um and a keyboard um what about a webcam if you're using AI a hoot so just think ahead check the internet connection I know you know that but um if you're using a particular space around the school sometimes we see teachers bringing together students for a really fun big event in a library or in a cafeteria or a gym but something they didn't quite think about ahead of time is what's the internet like in there until you get in there and it doesn't work and so go down there and give it a little trial run and see how that goes and if not um reach out to your school or District administrator for technology to help get some support with that before next week um make sure you access and review those free teacher resources of each course they're there for you um to help support you and last but not least if you need help please visit our help center and this link is here on the slides um but it is an amazing resource you can come here anytime for on demand support we have articles that are right here but also you can search at anytime like if you want student sign in you can also search for it and it's going to give you all of our articles about how students can sign in to help you great tutorials so check that out and last but not least celebrate your kids um we all like to be celebrated right so come here and get these student certificates and recognize them whether you send them home put them in the hallway take pictures of them and if they do take pictures with them U maybe post us and tag us on social media as well so recognize those those friends so thank you all so much for joining us today um whether you are live right now or watching us recording um we're excited to partner with you and provide this special opportunity to your students during the week of December 4th um like I mentioned please make sure that if you want to tag um hang with us or also tag us at COD Monkey St on any of our social media sites um visit our help center if you need support um and then also if you're interested in learning more and moving forward with a subscription please reach out to Molly um she'd love to help support you with that and her sales team so um let's see we're out of time but um let's check out Molly do you mind telling me any questions maybe they had there in the chat that maybe we could answer quickly yes there was a great question from Brian which uh he asked what are common formats for offering the hour of code to students schoolwide designated time and day what are some the options you'd recommend that I POs to my administrators that is a million dooll question there Brian um I see it used in all different ways I just you know formerly worked in a school district um here this past year and I saw sometimes an individual teacher was just passionate about it and she offered that time for one hour just during that week um on her own or his own um I sometimes saw a library media specialist at the school kind of man that and have a whole schoolwide event and they pulled students um you know during maybe a related arts time and they hosted it just one day that week when they saw them um or I've seen a whole school celebrate and I've seen them um you know have like like people do like drop everything and read like drop everything in code and for that hour which I know can be risky with internet um for that hour every teacher gets on and it's a whole schoolwide event especially if you have enough devices you could do something like that um and then also at the district level I've seen districts have really neat competitions and um for like every you know student or teacher that participates um they do some sort of fun reward and they you know post it and make a big deal about it on their social media so um I've seen it used all different ways and I think that they're all great just giving students the opportunity is um you know the purpose of it and so um Brian please reach out to me individually if you want to at lauren. rodem monkey.com if you want to know or if you want to partner and talk about that further um but like I said I've seen many options I know we're getting close it's about you know three or four instructional days away now at this point we're at the end of the day on Tuesday but I'd love to talk to you more about that as well so um or if anyone in the chat you know wants to pop in how they're using it that would be great as well thanks Molly for that question and Brian Molly are there any other burning questions people had or um are we ready to wrap up that was it well thank every thank you everyone for joining us um like I said um please reach out to us um if you have further questions or need support um but we're really excited and we appreciate you providing your students this coding opportunity next week bye everyone
