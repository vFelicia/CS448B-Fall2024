welcome to return to sender let's learn about return return is used in functions use return to send back a value for example a number or a boolean let's look at this code we have a function called good banana that takes in a parameter b and we're returning a boolean in the main code we have an if statement that as the condition of the if statement we're calling that good banana function and passing in a banana so the banana gets passed into b and then in the return we are determining whether or not it's true or false whether the if the banana is rotten will return a false if the banana is yellow a good banana we will return it true so that boolean that's returned gets passed back to where it was called where the function was called so you could kind of think of this good banana banana being replaced by what's returned so if it returns a true we have if true and then we'll run the indented code let's look at an example here's a challenge where the monkey wants to get at the banana but must get past the gorilla so needs to make sure that it's really healthy and we could see that right now it's not so healthy it's 40 out of 100. so let's look at the code we have a function called healthy that does not take in a parameter it returns the result of this comparison we're calling the health function which returns a number and comparing it to 100. okay so if health returns 100 we return a true otherwise a false okay in the main code we're going to go to the health zone and let's see how we can use the healthy so until healthy okay because healthy returns a boolean a true or a false we could use it with our until that's our condition and until healthy we're going to wait once we are healthy we want to turn to banana i think we could just go to banana because it includes the turn two all right let's go ahead and run that okay looks like it worked here's a challenge where the monkey needs to get the banana but needs to scare away the crows first let's look how at how we're going to do this okay in the code we have a save function it does not have a parameter we're checking if each crow is watching so if crows with index zeros watching return a no if crows with index one is watching return a no and then we have a return s yes at the end so this brings up the concept that you could have multiple returns in a function but only one return will ever be reached meaning as soon as your program reaches a return it returns to the main code it leaves the function and it's not going to see the code below that return so that means if we hit this if we end up reaching this return yes it means that both these if statements were false meaning the crows were not watching also up to this point we've always used true and false as our booleans you could also use yes and no so yes is the same as true no is the same as false okay let's see how we're going to use the save function so we want to scare those crows away so until now we want to put a condition in because our save function uses return yes and no which is a boolean we could say until safe so until safe we want to scare away those crows so we're going to scare them away by saying something now what do we want to do after we've scared them away we want to go and get the banana okay let's run that okay we scared him away that worked oh we didn't get three stars let's see if we could reduce the lines of code to get three stars okay if we look at the function we could see that we have two if statements now these two if statements have slightly different conditions but they have the same exact indented code so that because of that we can consolidate them we could bring them together into one if statement and we're going to link them with an or because we want either if either of these are true we want to return no if they're both true or either of them are true we want to return now but otherwise we're going to return yes okay let's run that okay it worked oh we still don't have the three stars but i'm gonna leave that challenge to you good luck now it's your turn to use return good luck
