my name is Marissa and I am the coordinator of programs and Partnerships here at Young Women's Preparatory Network so I oversee various Partnerships and programs and make sure they're being implemented on all of our campus we are a network of all girls college preparatory Public Schools across Texas our schools are located here in Dallas Fort Worth Austin San Antonio we have two in Houston El Paso Midland and L and our campuses are usually located in lowincome areas and more more than half of our students are first generation so we really push to support those girls in those lowincome areas by giving them academic and Leadership skills to achieve success not only when they go to college but just in their life in general actually one of our teachers in Midland went to a um conference and they saw a presentation about Code Monkey in 2019 and so she was really interested in that and so she started using Code Monkey in her own classroom and then when she saw all of the success with her students um with the program she kind of told the network about it and so we started implementing Code Monkey in 2022 um in our all of of our schools so we've been using Code Monkey for about 2 years now going on three next year so we use Code Monkey in our Middle School and High School classrooms and all of our schools are stem based schools so Code Monkey fits very well into our curriculum and I would say Code Monkey does a really great job at catering to our students needs a lot of our students when they start in Middle School don't know what coding is or often think it's very difficult or something that they won't able to learn um but I think cold monkey does a very great job at breaking it down and making coding seem easy and not so scary so most of the Code Monkey lessons start with a very basic concept and they build upon that so all of our students experience small successes early on which I think is really great and we also encourage the students to think of themselves as teammates and coaches with their groupmates so they're really good at helping each other out and keeping a positive attitude especially when things start progressing over the course and it gets a little harder I would say that our teachers really love the resources and features in Code Monkey I know they really appreciate the student progress chart um they can see at a glance how many levels students have completed and based on the color of they of the star they know if they're needing Assistance or ring if they use the required skill for the level or if they simply just had too many lines to code I can also say that they like the grading tool um I think it helps them out and makes their job easier I think code monkey has contributed a lot especially with the introduction to coding Concepts they have HandsOn learning they learn problem solving skills creativity and real world application I think one of the biggest aspects that they like is the game feel to the program I know the students don't feel like they're logging on and doing you know that tedious schoolwork students are excited to log on and get farther into the program I know they also like the instant feedback and the stepbystep instruction when they are needing guidance um to pass a certain level and I know a lot of them have also kind of made it kind of like a competition in their classroom so they'll kind of see who get farther along and so I feel like that's really good and they get excitement out of that and it's fun for them so I would definitely say that um these schools that are not using Cod monkey are missing out Code Monkey is a program that is loved by both teachers and students and I feel like it's hard to come across a program that is loved by both um I would say this program is very userfriendly engaging and flexible and I know students will get more out of this program program than you could really imagine it doesn't only teach them how to code but it teaches them problem solving skills creativity collaboration and even gets them career ready so we love Code Monkey at ywpn
