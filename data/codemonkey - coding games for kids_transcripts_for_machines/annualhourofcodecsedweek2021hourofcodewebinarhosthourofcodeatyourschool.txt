okay everybody we are gonna go ahead and get started with today's event so welcome to the 2021 hour of code webinar series it is the start of our series or our webinar is the start of our hour of code kickoff event and so we're very thankful that you guys are spending the time with us today so welcome to our annual hour of code webinar the code monkey team wants to personally thank every single one of you for taking your time to join us today so please feel free to pop those questions in the chat box or in the q a and we will answer them and save a few of those for the end for q a please follow us on twitter facebook instagram and linkedin at foodmonkeystu and today during today's webinar you can also tweet at us using the hashtag cmwebinar we will do our best to answer any live tweets during the webinar and my team is also here to answer any questions that you have so please chat with us alongside in the chat box or ask any of those questions in the q a the q a is always a bit easier for us to track instead of having your chats get lost in the box and if we do not answer your questions immediately during today's webinar we will make sure that we get to them during the q a or follow up with you directly after today's webinar following today's webinar with the following the recording that we'll send out for today's webinar a survey will pop up and that will give you access to professional development certificate for the time that you have spent with us today so let's go ahead and get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world so first we always like to kick off by starting out by introducing who's joining us from the team and so today you are joined by myself and i am lena saleh i'm the professional development manager um here at codemonkey you can reach out to me at lena codemonkey on twitter or you can send me an email if you have any questions following up today's webinar and i have been with codemonkey for now about um almost four years so this is i'm excited to do my fourth webinar this year with you all fourth year of our code webinar also joining us is my team brett eskelsen he is the vp of sales and so you can also reach out to him right at codemonkey.com if you have any questions we also have molly shubach she is our director of sales as well and you can reach her here at her email and they will be answering any questions alongside the chat box and we do have another member of our code mckee team joining us today and that's maya and she will be also answering those questions in the chat box i feel bad if her missed her slide today so um if you have any questions those three will be joining me today and answering any questions so feel free to ask those as they come up okay so what exactly will be even covering to the end today's webinar well we're going to talk about what is the hour of code codemonkeystory where to find us for the hour of code covering those hour of code courses that you'll have access to and the tips and tricks for setting up for an hour of code requiring the technical requirements teacher notes and teacher lesson plans and resources as well as leaving time to explore those courses and for q and a so what is the hour of code i'm sure most of you at this point have heard about the hour of code the hour of code is really just an introduction or giving students a taste to computer science i also like to say it's also giving teachers a taste for computer science it's really low risk and it allows everyone to explore computer science um in a fun way and i think once you start to explore and bring computer science and really the hour of code into your classroom you'll be hooked and so with your students so it really was designed to demystify code and show that anyone can really learn the basics of coding it breaks down many stereotypes and opens many doors there's also a lot of computational thinking problem solving collaboration and different skill sets that will assist students throughout any content areas that they are exposed to and just keep in mind um that the hour of code is really just designed to be a taste of hour of code a student isn't going to be walking away with a computer science degree at the end of the hour of code it's really just to give them an unintimidating way to be introduced to computer science so you always have access to any of our code courses all year long so if you don't do it this week during the computer science education week you do still have access to all of those courses all year long and this week or this next week for the computer science education week also known as the hour of code will you'll see many different activities and different exposure opportunities for your students during that during that week so feel free to take that risk so what are others saying about the importance of coding well we've seen people like mark zuckerberg and steve jobs and the ceo of microsoft talking about really the importance of coding and we've seen computer science really transition itself since 2013 when it very first started with its very first event with just a few courses um and now we there are hundreds over 200 actually partners that are part of the hour of code event what you'll see and some will have some really cool we have a really great article coming out blog post about computer science but computer science really trickles into anything from doing data sets at a baseball game to programming road signs and really more complex things like we see in big tech like facebook and twitter and instagram and all of those other things that we're being exposed to and there'll also be lots of twitter chats and things i forgot to mention throughout the week um so now we know exactly what the hour code is and kind of the backstory for the hour of code let's talk a little bit about codemonkey obviously we thank you so much for joining us so in 2014 the year after the first hour of code event code monkey's ceo and founder jonathan shore launched code monkey after working with kids and a lot of atrisk youth and just seeing how much they grasp the concepts versus how much better they grasp the coding concepts which can be really complex and the language can be very syntax heavy curly brackets semicolons all of those things can really trick students up but when they turned his brother and himself turned the game into turned the code into a game the students were hooked and like that they started to see the students were grasping concepts in a and they were excited about what they were doing so today codemonkey is a leading fun and intuitive curriculum for students in grades k through eight um where they do learn to code in many different programming languages first we just started out with coffeescript now we have blockbase and python so we have quite the variety of that as well so that's how codemonkey got started so what does make us a bit different is that codemonkey stems from an easy and gamelike manner we really try to scaffold it it's more gamified students learn i'm in a more linear manner it's userfriendly and it's very intuitive for students we try to scaffold it as much as possible along the way and also what we really do really well is putting teachers in the driver's seat we have many tools and resources to make you feel successful as well because as teachers that's sometimes the biggest inhibiting factor is that most of us teaching the younger grade levels just don't have the background knowledge of being a computer science teacher i myself taught in the classroom as well when i first started teaching computer science back in actually 2013 the first hour of code i just really didn't have the tools in my back pocket but when i started using the resources provided by hour of code i really started to grasp computer science as well and then i could have more robust conversations and really take that ownership for teaching code as well but we really do try to give you all of those tools so it's not intimidating for you to teach it with your students and to utilize it and it's also extremely easy to roll out being that it's completely webbased so let's talk about where can you even find the hour of code how can you get there what do you do well hour of code you can still go to code.org but now it is hourofcode.com and make sure i am sharing my screen here all right great um so it is hourofcode.com now um so it's all just one word or you can still go to code.org and there will be the hour of code listed there they just branch it off into a new web page with the more games and just to kind of help with keeping everything together so how you would find code monkey is i'm here on the hour of code.com page which they'll throw in the chat box here for you in just a few minutes and when you click on try it is when you'll actually get to um it's how you'll actually excuse me sorry how you'll actually get to the courses themselves you'll see there's all different grade levels prereader grade two through five six through eight nine you have beginner and comfortable and this year we are very very excited um code monkey the new block jumper course is actually located right here on the front page so that's exciting for us um but you can actually sort by you can do by recommended or you can sort by whoever created the course so you'll see there's many many many many different coding opportunities and platforms that you're able to utilize but if you go down here you can find code monkey here it's listed as code monkey studios and you're able to see all of the courses that are available here you can search for beginner or you can search for comfortable comfortable just means that the students have had a bit of exposure to using the courses which will dive in a bit deeper to coding itself and so these will just present a bit more challenge for the students so beginner is always a good place to start if you're not really sure you can also sort by which ones work best on which device so if i do ipad you'll see it limited a few of the courses that we have available those more tech space work better on something like a chromebook or something more webbased and so that will be located there for you as well now how do you also get to it from code monkey itself well you can also go to the code monkey webpage and if you scroll down to the bottom of the page you'll see down here in the footer there is oops excuse me down here in the footer is the hour of code page under curriculum or there is also a link that that my team will throw in the box here and that's just codemonkey.com slash hour of code which you can see right here so we will go back here to the page and when we're here you'll see it's just the taste of coding which is the hour of code and here we have all of the courses located here for you as well when you click on them these ones do not require you to have a login you can play these all year long just keep in mind that doesn't keep the progress as it would if you were logged in with a teacher trial or a an account um here you'll find um here you'll find that they are located sorry um here you'll find all of the courses here you'll also see there by grade level prek what language they are in so we have our block based courses here and then the specific grade levels that they're specific to code.org will sort it based on the beginner and the comfortable and here you're able to see it based on grade level and so it'll give you a little bit of context about what each one of the games is about and when i click on any specific one of the hour of code courses that we offer here you can start playing right here you can also see um basically how many levels there are what concepts the students will be covering so that's always sometimes really nice to know and then the block based sequences so we'll get mentioned more of this here in just a few minutes but i just wanted you to know that's there if you do want to have access to yours to some of the features that code monkey offers you can sign up for a free teacher trial it does give you access for 100 students so you can have the opportunity to kind of check out those hour of code courses and track them there in the platform itself now we know how to get to the courses we've done that now what else is next well we just covered the hour of code courses from our blog base to our tech space and you'll be able to see those on the code monkey page or our or sorry code.orgs page as well so be sure to check those out okay now let's talk a little bit about the sequencing so on code monkeys are on the hour of code it sorts it into beginner and sorts it into comfortable but we do actually have scope and this is the same we have hour of code courses of all of our courses um so code monkey junior this is a really good place and an unintimidating way to start with all of your students i even recommend it for the older students middle school um just so they can kind of get that taste and window in an unintimidating way this code monkey junior is completely block based there is no text it is really about computational thinking you're moving a monkey forward and backwards and jumping and it's a really good place to start then we have our beaver achiever and so you work through different work through different concepts and that is also block based and then we have coding adventure that's tech space that's a coffee script or that is coffeescript and coffeescript is short for javascript coffee java it just means it doesn't have any syntax meaning there's no curly brackets there's no semicolons there's not some weird syntaxing that's there it's really clean and it's really going to build the foundational skills for students and then there's dota does math so in the dota's math hour of code course they work through multiplication angles where they're picking up a protractor and measuring and then also working through so distances multiplication and the angle measurement will all be combined in that hour of code course we also have our game builder of course that will work the students through our shorter version of our platformer course a super mario style very scaffolded they'll work step by step to be able to build their own game by time they get to the end and we also have a block based course of this as well so just depending on where your students are and then we do have banana tails banana tails is python so they work through a baby monkey finding his twin baby brother working through different obstacles through those coding concepts and then we do have a coding chatbot where they are building um a chat bot that is um full python as well and then what's not listed on here is moonlander that's one of the more challenging courses of the hour of code courses it is physics and so they're working on thrust and acceleration and they have to get a moon lander onto the pad and then the other one is space monkey so there's also that one too so let's go ahead and let's dive into the courses and kind of explore what those are and what there is there don't forget if you have any questions feel free to go ahead and pop those right into that chat box or into the q a so to get to the hour of code courses if you're not logged in you can go ahead and you can just click start playing so in this code monkey junior here something i want to note is you will go back out to this story map here and i'm i'm actually logged in so let me do a new screen share here just one second for my other account so you can see what that looks like if you're logged in and your students have an account then they will their progress will be saved however if not it will look like this so when you go to the story map you'll see everything is locked until i've been there so i can't do one i can't do five before i've done one i have to do everything in between this is something to keep in mind for any hour of code course that you do decide to take just keep in mind it won't keep students progress so if something crashes like low bandwidth hour of code can be a very busy time in the computer science world and for all of those all of those curriculum providers and so just keep in mind that if the students do walk out or there's computer crashes or something happens that they will in fact have to start over so that's just something to keep in the back of your mind for that preparation time frame as well so when we click on the exercise here this is really great because you can move it and drag it there are fun sounds i just have the sounds turned off right now but feel free to turn those on at any time and then you can see i can drag or i can click to be able to get the monkey to his treasure box and so they work through different components here sequencing and then they get into loops and that's the end of the hour of code course for that one so we also have our beaver achiever and i won't be going into all of the courses in their entirety today but i do want you to see i'm here you'll see that we go over sequencing loops and some logic here and it's ideal for six to seven year olds so really for first or second grade i would recommend that if you're working with kindergarten um that it it will be best to start with ko monkey junior first and then it does tell you how many levels there are so there'll be 12 levers here so you start playing exactly the same concept here you'll see the story map as well and the story map has 12 um challenges for which the students will be working on and here the goal is to fill um this hole with logs so that the beaver is able to go swimming this little parrot down here who's snoozing away this is a new feature that we just recently added when you click on him he will actually have the sound turned off on your end but he will actually read the blocks for students so when he's off he's snoozing when he's on his eyes are awake and he's he's so cute um so we're just going to click and drag and we'll see that if there isn't anything connected that means that the students don't have any code working they will need to snap those blocks together in order to get it to run and then they'll be able to move on to the next challenge and it will increase in with intensity as it goes along as far as teacher resources go something i'll mention which will dive a bit deeper here in just a second is there are notes here for you so you will be able to access the notes here you're able to see what text specs are available so do you need to download anything all everything that we do have is webbased komaki jr does have an app but i would suggest going webbased with that one as well even though it is available on an ipad it does tell you a little bit of prep so making sure you test those coding programs just to make sure everything is working for you if not reach out to your tech or it directors and then the certificates so we do have certificates that you can print you can do the hour of code ones or we do have exclusive code monkey ones and something that i really like to note about our code when we get more into the prep thing is this is a really good place to involve parents and then you can also see the specific standards that are associated with each one of these hour of code courses um so we went into the beaver achiever and then this space adventure or we'd like to call him space monkey over here at code monkey you can click on space spunky and this is also coffeescript as well and so this one this time they will have to write out the text these buttons down here do type out for the students as well and as well as any of the objects that you hover over that has white text this is our space monkey this is space gordo and so space gordo is a teacher assistant he pops up with those tips and directions for the students same concept with the story map it's locked until they proceed on to the next one so if i just run this as is you'll see that moving up got us there and then they're yielded with a star solution if you have a teacher trial this will report back to you on the progress side but gordo does do some tips and tricks and that kind of a thing as well there is sound and narration for this one as well i just have this turned off so if you're interested in that you get stuck at any time just let us know um so this one here we can see we're going to need to move forward and the students will need to move backwards so just a little bit more thinking as it progresses and this one is in coffeescript as well and then the first course that we ever had in codemonkey is coding adventure this one is that same concept of coffeescript and here we have gordo and you actually can use this ruler to measure the distances you just click on the top of the monkey's head and you click to the banana and then you'll run it in the same way so it is that similar language that is in our space adventure is in coding adventure same concept with the with the map here um something that you do have access to even with the hour of code courses that we've recently added is these teacher tutorials so the students will have access to teacher tutorials if they get stuck this teacher walks them through specific concepts that they're exposed to this can help with that additional scaffolding for students okay um so let's check out one of our new favorite courses and our ceo will actually be reading a coding class for students next week so if you haven't checked that out make sure that you check that out we'll send you a link to that at the end here so you can click on start playing this one has 10 challenges this one also is narrated as well if you click right here and the goal here is we have the different sprites and we want to create and have the monkey reach the star so we click run nothing happens there's no event i'm not pushing anything the code doesn't automatically run like in other courses so it does tell us that we need to do something and what do we need to do in this case we need to step and how much am i going to step when it runs it's going to step one pixel essentially every single time so he moves we've seen that however moving on run sorry not every single time he'll only move that one specific spot so in this case it tells us that we need to move it we need to change it to 300 and then we're going to check if we did that correctly and then now we're going to click on run and see if it works so now he did move the exact distance here this one does show you the coordinates on the other ones they're built in behind the scenes and you're not able to see them but here you are able to see the exact coordinates so we can actually see how far does he need to step by doing a little bit of math so just some different integrations that are happening inside of the course itself um and then you'll see i'll give you an example of our python course so we'll go ahead and we will go into banana tales and so when we go to banana tails that same concept of the story map as well there's always a trailer at the beginning basically these two twins get split up and then there's some different um specific hints that are that are built in right here so you're able to see those as well and so the goal here is that we need to get this car down to the monkey so he can be fed because he is a hungry bear so it tells us we there is no need to add or change anything so this car can get to the monkey because there's no holes right now and this one does show the coordinate grid so you can see that and when i click on run he gets to the monkey the first one is just an intro and then when we get to our second challenge here it gives us the star solution which if you had a teacher trial or you have an existing account you're able to see this on your side and now we need to adjust the height so we can see the giraffe here we can click on the level setup i can see the exact coordinates of where the draft is there's no ruler to add or subtract the students are having to do a bit more math here to figure out how far the actual distance is for him um so we can run it as is debug the challenge and we see that that actually worked out perfectly and so this is going to get there for him you'll see in the first challenge this wasn't here but now it is there are builtin reference cards these reference cards will open as the students are exposed to more concepts so if they forgot what a concept is this will help them give them some different tips to get there in addition to the ones that are here in the hints okay and we will do one last one and that's the moon lander and moon lander is one of my favorites but like i said the one i find it to be the most challenging i find it tricky to get that moon lander to land right on the launching pad here the concepts that we're going to be covering here it says that they'll be using to they'll be using physics concepts this was actually designed for an international cyber security nafa competition in israel so that's how this course was actually designed so just a fun fact there here you'll see this looks like the game the block jumper interface it's the same sort of concept there here we have the coordinate grid just like we had on the other one and then we have some specific concepts here so this one tells us that we need to create our own game and we need to get the spaceship to land safely on the moon i'm the worst at getting to land on the moon but i know kids are way better at playing those types of things than myself um it tells us that we need to use thrust so this is automatically talking about thrust within the on key so what i have here is a sprite and this is my spaceship is the sprite and i have a code you'll see i have two sprites here i have a star and a spaceship and i'm going to program inside the spaceship because that's what it tells us to do and it tells us that we do need to use thrust so you can either type it out or the students can come down here and find the buttons and what do we actually need to do well when i push a key that says any key something will happen and we're going to want it to thrust that means it's going to that means it's going to move up we're gonna we're gonna thrust it so when i click that then you'll see when i push any key so i'm pushing one key on the key if i don't do anything nothing happens if i push a key on the keyboard then it actually thrusts up to where it needs to go um this one also has those same reference cards built in here so the students aren't sure about any anything that's happening here this is a really good point for them especially if you're not creating a teacher trial and you don't have the answers right at your fingertips which we do provide in the teacher trial on the progress page and in the teacher resources this is a good way for you to see that and know that as well okay so we have explored most of the hour of code courses just keep in mind it's always good to kind of play them there was a question here is a reason why i'm getting access denied for the hour of code courses if you have an expired trial and you're not able to log in and you're not when you log in you're not able to access them it kind of blocks that kind of roadblocks you there so you will just need to make sure that you're signed out so you have access to those um so it's just good to play with those beforehand i've had many of our code events where i thought oh yeah i got this in the bag and then i try to test things and they didn't work not because the program or the curriculum provider didn't have it but my district didn't have the right settings in place for that okay now let's get into more of the preparation for hour of code um so some things to kind of prepare for the hour of code i find hour to code we just had a twitter chat yesterday so feel free to check that out as well but i find our code the best place to invite industry or invite partners or really to create a really great buyin you can invite everyone can run different programs i mean each one can run different activities like unplugged activities where you're doing movement there's all kinds of opportunity to bring other stakeholders to the table i personally love having parents come in and run activities they always want to help so this is a really great place i know that with a pandemic it's a bit tricky but you can run hour of code events online or in person so just kind of keep that in mind there laredo isd i know some of them are on here they have a coding competition at the end of their um they have a digital learning day and they actually live stream a coding event so there are different opportunities of which that you can bring those different stakeholders and show them what you're doing and showcase them it's a really great place to create buyin and and also just show how fun computer science can be um so some things that we talked about earlier was preparing certificates there are cell you can also have a certificate and use a program like autocrat or something like that where you have a form and then in that form you can have the students put their names in and then we'll just autocreate a certificate for them as well or have those preprinted that's also a good place to have those parents come in and help with those pieces and beforehand testing it out before using it it's a really good plate it's a really good rule of thumb to always test out the tech before you've used it you know that when you think you have everything ready to go something always goes wrong so it's good to know especially during the hour of code week is one of the busiest weeks for every curriculum provider there are thousands worldwide using the platforms and checking everything out so just really testing them out beforehand especially if you're using logins students really struggle and we want them to spend the most time coding and to not be tied down by having to log something in and not getting the opportunity to have that taste of coding um also there's some really great unplugged activities that we have here so codemonkey we have all of our unplugged we have a blog post here about unplugged activities that you can check out and utilize those so an unplugged activity means you're not doing anything online that means that it's offline so there's some really good things like you know um i used to buy shower curtains from the store that had like those grid patterns and set something on it you know a rock or it could be i don't know whatever a pen it doesn't matter and having the students use cards to walk me through i'm having them plan them out with arrows like exactly what code monkey jr is doing but on the floor and having them use those tiles to navigate to get there and then having them write the quote write the code or script it or having another student come in and actually run through the code that they wrote so it's a good way to kind of also create that conversation about it and problem solving and strategizing different ways csm plugged is also a really good one they have they just redid their website which is was much needed and long overdue um there's lots of unplugged activities there code.org always has a ton that i recommend checking out binary bracelets is a good one to have like your art teacher do um working through you know pattern recognition and different things like that and then another one another unsung hero for unplugged activities is barefoot computing they have some really great ones that they did um even from the pandemic they have an unplugged coding activity with washing your hands and what an algorithm is like for washing your hands so some just different ways to bring other people to the table so typically when doing an hour of code event in the class or even with other teachers that i've that i've worked with they set up stations and so a station one station might be with the pe teacher where they're having to maybe hop over something and then having to code that out using a whiteboard or markers or having another student script it for them and then then the other student going back and doing their exact directions then having a station where they're plugged in and they're doing certain activities and maybe you have maybe your pair maybe your peer sharing so maybe you invite a kindergarten group to come up with a third grade and they're working through those together you'd be very shocked that the kindergartener will actually probably get further than the third grader just because they have low inhibitions and they're ready to take risks and then having those different you know stations set up you can have it all around the school you can have your whole school doing an hour of code just different opportunities there and during the hour of code week if you want there's always a lot of people who are willing to come in and do guest appearances you know virtually guest appearances so it's a good place to invite people in i know i myself i'm doing a couple of events supporting some different schools so feel free to reach out to your curriculum providers or really try to utilize those resources around you everyone is using computers so they can come speak to your students to also create a bit of buyin as well and then just really making sure that you have those unplugged you know certificates students love certificates parents love certificates so it's really good to have those things prepped beforehand and tested i can't say that enough test test tests beforehand just to make sure everything goes have that happen where nothing works and so we just spend the time just problem solving and trying to figure that out so we want them to have the best best first experience coding as possible um so i know that was pretty fast and furious but i also want to leave some time for questions for you so today we did cover what the hour of code is when it first started code monkey story itself where to find us so you can find us on the hour of code website by going to by going here to hour of code and it is learn here and when you click on so we go back to hour of code itself you click on try it and then you're able to locate those um the block jumper course like i mentioned is right here and then you can sort by um the curriculum provider right here and then for finding code monkey itself you would go to codemonkey.com or go to that code monkey hour code link that we shared with you and when you click on hour of code then you're able to see all of those activities that we have there for you to just introduce students to coding also just making sure some tips and tricks try to invite many stakeholders in if you can i know things are still a bit tricky out there but trying to invite some people in to help you run those hour code events i know some of the teachers during the twitter chat that we had yesterday were discussing how they um also have former students come down and work with their students and kind of help lead the hour of code kind of thinking of like a field day for hour of code making sure you test those technical requirements you were able to see the teacher notes and what was there on the teacher notes so we can actually go back here to the teacher notes themselves when you go to the hour code you'll have the access the notes if you have a teacher trial you'll have full lesson plans but here you'll just have the notes and then this will just tell you what concepts they're covering and just kind of to help you host that hour of code event and then it will tell you the specific programming languages and and those types of things right there for you and so now we're going to leave some time for q a for each one of you to ask any questions or for our panelists to ask any questions and then we're going to go over a few things that are up and coming um this is a good question could you show us again how to access the code monkey certificates not um hour of code absolutely so how you would access the certificates is you would go to our website here and here when we are in the teacher notes or the teacher notes for every single course when you click on certificates this one brings you to the hour of code but how you actually access the code monkey ones if you don't have a subscription is in our press pack which i was going to share with you in just a few minutes but here it says to download the images it's really just a google drive folder here you will see all of the certificates and so you'll see the certificate for hours i'll also make sure that this is updated here to include the other certificates that we offer too but they should all be here listed for you it looks like we need to add a couple more there and then we do have a specific hour of code folder for you all so we have specific animated images that we have here as well as you can see i'm using a zoom background here we have a couple of zoom backgrounds for you and as we create more images we'll be adding those to that as well so we encourage you to use those during the hour of code as well um okay i'm just looking to see here okay so this is a great question could i ask about high school i have some students with a cs background some not many of the hour programs i've seen start from zero is there a quick way to indicate prerequisite knowledge of some of the more advanced levels that way i can curate an hour of code for many levels um so that's a bit it's a bit tricky in that way i would say that we have many many many high schools using our our coding adventure and our banana tales courses i would say that the first 30 challenges which is what you get an hour of code is is would be a really good prerequisite for you to see where the students are and if you feel like they're flying through the coding adventure course so i'll just go back here to um pull up our code monkey so you'll see code monkey studios so here what i would do is i would start them with the coding adventure for prerequisite and that's for any high school i've worked at conferences i've seen many high school students use this as well coding adventure is a good just starting point goes through sequencing and it goes through loops and also goes through object oriented programming so there's some different concepts that are there which would be a really good quick guide if they go through it super super fast then i would definitely say go towards this python oh sorry go to this banana tails it says beginner but it goes really advanced pretty quickly so i would say that would be your next your next one so i would say do coding adventure first and then i would do the banana teals and then i would shoot for them to do if they're high schoolers they could do the trivia chatbot it's pretty challenging for students that may have different backgrounds or things like that so that would be the best way this is the first time viewing the program what is the curriculum you mentioned what grades and basic costs and subscriptions and how do you get one um so with the so there's lots of questions there um so the curriculum that i mentioned is we do have a k8 scope and sequence so i'll just go here um so you all can see it so here i mentioned with a subscription to code monkey you do get access to all the curriculum we offer um so it does move from the k8 span like i mentioned we do have high schools some of them using this banana tails encoding chat bots so that's definitely an opportunity there as well it can kind of be a variable range based on students ability level and things like that so that's a great question as far as pricing and the basic costs and things like that we will be running our half yearly pilot pilot so if you have a question we'll actually link here in the chat box a request for more information um so molly thank you so much has been throwing in links just so fast she put in here for a teacher trial so you can check out the teacher trial or you can request more information and so we'll go ahead and throw that there in the chat box for you as well okay so you guys have some really great questions and i really appreciate it so i'm just going to talk about some things that are actually coming up for next week for the hour of code we do have two we actually have three webinars happening next week on monday we have our code monkey women in stem actually at code monkey we are we are an equal ratio of women to men and so we will be having the women in stem so we actually have um we actually have more women developers than we do have men um so they will be talking about how their their different pathways to stem hardships that they face as being a woman in stem and so we're having that panel conversation there and that will be monday at 11 a.m everything is at 11 a.m eastern this year same time all week long on tuesday we will be having jonathan who i mentioned in the very very beginning so these two are the founders of code monkey of jonathan and ido jonathan will be hosting an interactive online class for students and he will be doing coding adventure and go on wednesday we'll be leading a class with students on block jumper and going over different components of that and each one of them have worked with students before becoming the founders of good monkey and then also have taught different coding classes and things like that so it's going to be really really fun for those students so we encourage you to register last year we had so many attendees and that i would definitely encourage you to register beforehand so i'm actually going to throw in a link for each of you uh or a link here for just make sure this is the correct link here okay so i'm gonna throw in our link here this is going to show you all of the right at the top there let me just copy this and show you so the link that i just shared with you will have access to um all you'll see here the hour of code tips and tricks webinar that's the webinar we're doing right now the live coding cat live coding class with our founders code monkey sorry coding adventure and block jumper and then you're able to see the chats here the women in stem is not quite up here quite yet so we'll need to make sure that we get that there for you you can also see all of the hour of code courses there anything that you need is right here in this link that we've provided for you in the chat box there we also have a competition that i'm actually going to let we actually are going to have a competition that we're doing next week for students and so in code monkey itself each we have these preloaded avatars that have been created so when i click here we have all these avatars that have been associated so we're actually going to be having a competition for students to create an avatar and a few of the students avatars will be selected and we will code monkeyify them we'll modify them and the avatars will actually be available for students to choose so we're really excited about that one and so be on the lookout tomorrow for the recording of this webinar and then the opportunity to register for all of the webinars for next week molly brett maya have i missed any questions coming through there no you're great okay well great if you do have any questions about anything feel free to reach out to us at info codemonkey dot com and be sure to register for next week's webinars we're really excited about them they were a big hit last year and i think you'll students will really enjoy it those of you that have joined us first time or not your first time we want to thank you so much for taking time out of your day we know that you are listen life has not
