okay in this video I'm going to show you how to make a clickable button in Roblox so you're firstly going to want to create a GUI okay so in the starter GUI we'll just insert a screen GUI and then you want to insert a text button although you could also use an image button but for this purpose of the tutorial it's not really necessary and then what we'll do is we'll just drag this around somewhere on the screen and what you then want to do is you want to insert a local script now now what I like to do is I like to have one local script really that just controls everything rather than having a a local script in every single uh GUI elements so what we'll do is we'll have our local script in the starter GUI and we'll just create a variable for our text button and this will be script. parent wait forchild screen GUI wait forch child text button okay and then when we've got the text button we can say text button Dot and then we have a load of different events that we can choose from such as RBX sorry such as Mouse button one click or um if we just start typing you'll see a lot more so Mouse button one click or Mouse button one down when you press down the mouse button this one will fire when you let go the mouse button one click will fire so that's the difference between them so we're going to do a mouse button one click Mouse button one is just the left button on your mouse it will also fire if you tap on a mobile device so don't worry about that uh colon connect function okay and then inside this function we can write the code that will execute when the button is pressed so we could print out button has been clicked for example and if we click on play here or play solo and we click on the button you can see it's printing out that the button has been clicked but this doesn't really do anything it's quite basic so how can we make this a little bit more um functional well it depends what you want to do really if you want to open up a frame let's just put a frame in the middle of the screen I'm going to set the size and position to 05050 and I'm going to set the Anchor Point to again 0. 5.5 so let's just select this Frame and we'll make it invisible we uncheck the visible property and if we wanted to make this Frame appear we could well we'll firstly create a variable for it so local frame equals script. parents wait for child frame oh sorry wait for child screen GUI wait for child frame we could say frame do visible equals not frame visible so it's taking the current the current visible property of the frame which is either true or false and it's inverting it so what this will do is it will give us the opposite of what the frames visibility property currently is so if if it's true we will set it to false and if it's false we'll set it to true so we're essentially just toggling it now if we play the game again you'll notice that when we press the button the frame appears and when we click it again it goes away so this is how pretty much every menu system in Roblox works the the GUI is always there the frame is always there it just gets uh it just gets hidden or shown depending on the status of the visible property which we're changing via the button so we've we've stepped up a little bit there we've we've made the the frame uh actually be a bit more interactive um well we've made the button more interactive by opening and closing the frame perhaps now we should actually change the text of the button to say open and then in our local script we want to change this text depending on whether the frame is visible or not so underneath here we'll just create a uh we'll say text button. text equals and this text is either going to be open or it's either going to be close right but how do we set this depending on the frames visibility well it's quite similar to how we've just done the frame. visible we'll say frame. visible and open or close and what this means is this is going to return a true or false value depending on whether the frame is visible or not if it's true then it's going to we're going to return open because when a statement is true we want this to be returned otherwise if it's false if it's not true then it will return close this is almost like a mini function we have a condition which can either be true or false which is whether the frame is visible or not if this condition is true then we will the text will be open or if it is not true that means the frame is oh I've got this the wrong way I've got this the wrong way around round sorry this should be close and this should be open because if the FR if the if the frame is visible so if this is true then we want the text button to say close right but if it is not visible then we want the text button to say open okay now I I know this could be a bit confusing but this is basically a shortened way of doing an if statement it's the same thing as saying ifame visible then text button. text equals close else text button. text equals open but this spans 1 two 3 four five this spans five lines we do the same thing twice it's just a a condensed way of saying well look if frames if the frame is visible then we want it to say close otherwise we want it to say open and we'll get more into this when I make a video about conditionals and if statements and things but if we click on play and run this you'll notice that when we click on the button it says close and when we you know when we when when the frame is hidden it says open again so very very simple way of um having a a button which opens and closes a GUI and just a brief introduction as well into how uh text buttons and image buttons work in in Roblox so let me know if you enjoyed this video uh and if you want any more GUI videos I'm happy to make them uh and I will see you in the next one
