hello and welcome back to another video just want to say sorry for the lack of videos recently I've been busy working on my game which I'm going to be releasing soon and also some other things that I have to do but I am returning back with a video today to talk to you about the new roblox feature which can allow you to earn more money from your games outside of the dev X program and it's called premium payouts so premium payouts are roblox is way of rewarding you for having good games okay so if you have a game which Premium roblox premium subscribers play quite often and they are engaging with your game so they're spending quite a lot of time in that game compared to other games Premium payouts are calculated based on other games how they score as well the premium playtime which you can see here that is your like score which tells roblox how good your game is at keeping players engaged with your game to keep them playing okay and the higher this premium playtime score then the higher your premium power is going to be and as I say this score is like compared to other roblox games as well so you can view your own premium playtime score and you can also see your premium payouts now if you don't have many players concurrent in your game then it's likely that you're not going to have much much of a high premium score so you're not going to be earning much from human powerhouse but if you do have a game that does have quite quite a few concurrent players consistently then it's something that you might want to check out and have a look at you or your score so and if we just have a look here to increase these payouts you can encourage your players to buy premium so roblox premium you can encourage them to subscribe to robots premium buy so adding certain things in your games so for example if you buy roblox premium then you'll get access to this map or this level or this sword or this item in my game so you're giving them benefits if they buy roblox premium now that's up to you whether you implement that into your game you don't have to but that this is the premium upsell model that's something different where you can elect people purchase roblox premium straight from your game but that's not what we're talking about today we're talking about premium payouts so let me just show you how you can view your premium payouts score so on the game's page if you just click on the three dots now you can only do this for your own games so you can't do it for someone else's but if you go to the developer stats over here and just wait for that to load okay so if you click on premium over here you can see that this graph will show you the premium play time and the premium plate I'm sorry the premium score and the row books that you've earned from that so it's calculated every day based off the amount of time that roblox premium subscribers spend playing your game so if they spend more time then you can earn more and free time premium placed on Robox earned depends on your score so if you have a lower score you're going to earn less money but this is an empty graph because this is a game which isn't public and it's not advertised or anything but if you do have a game which does have a consistent amount of players in it all time then you should start to see a score and some premium playtime roebucks accumulating here now I did say earlier it was separate to the dev X program now I'm pretty sure that you do have to still cash out the ROI books earn from premium payouts through dev X but what I meant was that it said it's a different way of monetizing your game instead of game passes and developer products which are the usual things which you would devic from there's also a great article on the roblox developer website which I'm going to link to you in the description basically tells you what you should be using the premium purchases for so you know don't make it pay to win don't give you no more beneficial things that can influence your game to premium subscribers be honest avoid paywalls etc and it also gives you a better guide and to see how your charts work here so I had an empty chart but you can see this is what it looks like on an average game so you've got your score and then you've got your euro books earn so it's it is likely that your score is going to be higher than the ROI books that you earn because that is used to determine how much row books you will receive for example if you had you know 800 K playtime robox earned then your score here you see there's two different there's two different scales so there you go so also there's some scripting guys as well on how you can add premium benefits in your game probably be covering this in a future video as well but go give it a read is very good and I'll leave a link to it in the description so that's all you need to know about the new premium payouts I hope it was useful and good luck using it in your game
