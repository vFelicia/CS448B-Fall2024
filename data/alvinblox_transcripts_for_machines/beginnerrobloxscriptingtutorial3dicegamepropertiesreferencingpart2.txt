hello and welcome to the third video in my scripting series now in the previous video or videos we learned how to use properties and reference objects in roblox games but today we're going to be putting that to use and I'll be showing you how to create a dice game okay so we've got two dice here or die and we have numbered them and we're gonna use a script so that when we run the game we can roll the dice and then produce a result so let's get started okay so don't worry about anything in the output here it's gonna clear that and let's get rid of what we currently have so we're going to want to have two parts in the game for our die so we're gonna click on the part button and this is generated apart so we now need to change the properties of this parts to make it look like a dice okay so the first thing that we need to do is obviously make it bigger so we're gonna go to the size property and because size is made up of three numbers it's called a vector3 value okay and a vector three is basically three numbers and each number represents an axis okay so the x axis the z axis and the y axis okay the you can see here on the move tool the red line is the x axis or the red arrows the blue arrows are these z axis and the green is the y axis which is going up and down and as you move the parts you can see they also change on the position property so we're just going to change this to 20 studs by 20 studs by 20 studs and that's going to make the part nice and big you can see the x y&z values are now 20 and the part is stuck in the ground so we're just going to drop that above ground here so this is what the this is how the die will be shaped we now are gonna just make it now we're going to change the color for it to be completely white like this we'll go institutional white and I'll set the material to smooth plastic okay now we are going to make the brick anchored for now so that it stays in the air and when we won we were going to roll it we can an anchor it okay so now that we have got the the part we need to add some numbers on the on the on the faces of the die so we're going to enter the tool box and you should see this popup and we're going to click on me look what's HAP here where it says models I'm going to click on images okay and this will allow us to search the roblox library and we can take an image that someone else has made now if you've got an image that you made yourself that you want to use you can click on inventory and go from there so we've clicked on images and we're just going to search for dice and then the number that we want so one and then we're going to click on it on the image and then we can select the part that we want this this image to go on to so we just click it and that creates a decal alright so inside of the part you can see there is now a decal object which basically just shows the the image so the texture here is is the ID of that image so decal can be applied to a part to show an image and so we're going to do the same thing again for dice too and just click on the parts again on each face dice three we're gonna click and click on the next face I'm gonna do this for all of the whoops I'm gonna do this for all of the different faces so dice for and dice five and now we need to do the bottom face so I'm gonna click the part and just turn it over by pressing ctrl T a couple of times until we get the right face and we can put dice one on here okay you can also rotate the part using the rotate tool so now we've got all of the numbers on our die we can actually have a second one so what we can do is we can clone this part so to clone it what we're going to do is just right click and click on duplicate or you can press ctrl + D or command D if you're on a Mac so now that was duplicated it and but you can't see the clone because it's in exact same position as the of the other clone so we can just move away and we now have to die but as I said in the previous video about names of parts they both have the same name part so we need to name each one dice one and dice two like this okay so now we've got our two dice and we can put them in the air like this now just to make it a little bit more random what we're going to do is we're going to move one die underneath the other so that when they both come down the top one is going to bounce off the second one okay and we'll also just rotate them a little bit so that they they bounce around a bit before they hit the ground which just makes it feel more random as well so now that we've got our two die we can start scripting because they're both anchored if we run the game and nothing currently happens so we need to tell a script what we want it's happened with with these dies okay so we're gonna insert a script into the server script service oops I did the module script we just need a normal script so click on scripts and then we're going to simply reference our die so game dot workspace dot dice one will do one first not anchored okay we're finding the property remember in the last video we don't have to reference the dice so the dice is inside of the workspace and it's got a property called anchored and anchored is it determines whether the part just stays in the air or whether it falls to the ground and we're gonna set an kurd to false because we want it to fall we want gravity to push it down okay so this is going to basically roll the first die we want to we want to wait for small number of time a small bit of time until we roll the second die okay and this will allow the first die to fall before the second so it bounces off of this die here okay so this is Oh that's died too let's just move that down down there so we want die dice one to fall first hit dice which will make it bit more random and then that dice two will fall as well after that so we're gonna have to do a wait now wait just delays the script okay so if you added awaits here so we do wait and then we do a pair of brackets or parenthesis and then if you put a number inside of here so one that's gonna delay the script from doing anything else so if I had another line of code game dot workspace dice to that and code equals false which is gonna roll the second eye okay this is a comment by the way it's so the script does it the script it just ignores it and it's it helps you understand you can write notes so you so you know what each line does so this is gonna roll the first die and it's basically gonna is this this start it's gonna fall but then we're gonna wait one second and then after that delay we're going to an anchor the second dice so these scripts going to pause before execute the next line okay because you know that a script executes line by line if we have a wait it's just going to stop right here wait the amount of the specified amount of time inside of the brackets so in this case one second and after that one second is going to earn anchor the second dice okay I'm going to change this to half a second so naught point five and now if you go and try this out you can see the first dice is let's see if we can change the white here to one second so you can notice the the change so the first dice hits dice and then the second ice falls as well so you see that that they don't both fall at the same time the dice falls a second after the first so we have just created a nice little dice game there but to make it a little bit more interesting we can change the gravity property of the workspace now I'm if you're going to the workspace and have the properties window open I touched on this in a previous video the gravity problem property I used it as an example but if you don't know what gravity is it's basically a force which pushes down on objects that are in the game or say for example these dice in the air if gravity is is higher the higher gravity is so so the bigger the number is then the higher the force which is going to push down on these bricks and so when gravity is higher the bricks are going to fall much quicker so if I change gravity to five hundred one hundred and ninety six point two is the default if I change it to five hundred you can see they fall a lot quicker and it looks more like a pair of dice so I'm gonna change the weight back to null point five I'm also gonna move up this thigh a little bit and let's try this out again so they're both fall to the ground and there we go we rolled a four so we've just created a cool little dice game using what we learnt so hopefully that taught you something and it shows how you can put the things we learn to use it's still very very basic but trust me we'll do more of these cool projects and they'll get cool as we go along so just stick with it and I'll see you in the next one so if you want to go to the next video I'll put a thumbnail to it on your screen now if you want to subscribe to the channel so you get notified of when I post a new video then click the album blocks logo on the screen as well there'll be an arrow pointing to it and don't forget to take the quiz there'll be a quiz on what we've learnt so far on my website I'll leave a link to it in the description so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one
