hello this video is about how to use remote functions in roblox in the previous video we looked at remote events and also filter enabled which we'll be going over in this one as well but the difference between remote events and remote functions is that they're basically they do the same thing but a remote function can return information or messages back to a local script once it's been fired okay so once it's done an action on the server it can return information back telling us you know whether it was completed or whether it failed etc so we can send messages back in the video we're going to be going over remote functions and we're gonna be doing a demonstration to show you how they work as well and how they would work in in a roblox game like certain use cases so let's get straight into it so I've got a rocket here credit two darkened and an eternity by the way for the model which are found in the toolbox this rocket we're gonna make it go to space okay and what we want to do is we want to only launch this rocket if a player knows the code okay so only certain players will be able to launch it so you'll need you need the code now what we'll do now we've already got the script to launch the rocket okay it's somewhere in this model but we're not gonna learn how to actually you know get into the scripting of launching a rocket but I've set this rocket up so that this value called launcher if we just change it to true or false it doesn't matter if we just change it change its value then the rocket will all lift off okay so what I've got here in our local scripts in this rocket launch GUI I've got a text box and a tap and a text button called launch button so when the user inputs their their code in this box okay and then they click launch we're going to launch this rocket but we've got a check to see whether the code is crew now we'll go into this local script and this is what I currently have now there are a couple of issues with this code the first issue is that because we are trying to fire the rocket from the client and we have failed to enable turned on these we're going to we're going to make this change on the server in the workspace but this change is only gonna it's only going to change for us okay because the server is going to see that we're trying to change the value of the launcher and then because filter enabled on it will prevent us from making that change okay I explained more about that in the previous video if you haven't checked it out I'll leave a card or put a link in the description so I'll show you if we go into the game here we go I'll just type in the code again 1 3 3 7 it says firing rocket so the local script has said it's fired but it's not going anywhere ok and if you go into the rocket model the launch of value is set to true on our end on the client okay but if we head to the server and this is the service copy of the game and this is what we this is what all the other players would have it is it should still be false yeah there we go it's still false ok and it wouldn't launch it would only it would only set the value to be true but because this these scripts that are in the rocket our server scripts and they run on the server the service copy is still set to false so it's not going to go anywhere so we have a problem we can't launch the rocket from the client so we're going to need to use a remote event or a remote function so which one do we use and this brings us to our second problem and this is that we are storing the code to launch the rocket in the local script and this is a really bad thing to do let me just change the text of our text let's here there we go and this is a really bad thing to do because anybody that doesn't know the code if we're storing it in a local script you know that local scripts they run on the players computer ok so the player runs the local script so this means that a player could and produce exploding software to view the local scripts ok and they could see aha the code is 1 3 3 7 and now they know what it is ok so that's what we don't want we don't want players to be able to exploit the game to find out what the code is so we're going to need to store the code on the server this is because if we store it on the server in a server script which runs on the server clients don't have access to to to those scripts ok so we're gonna have a script in server script service ok and we're also going to need a remote function but why do we need a remote function and not a remote event well I said a remote function returns information back to the client once we have triggered that remote function so an example would be if we put in the wrong code and then we checks whether the code was correct on the server if it was correct then we would launch the rocket on the server and then we could send information or message back to the local script to say that it was a success and then we could set the text of our textbox to say success launching rockets but if the code was wrong we could send a message from the server to the client saying that it was an incorrect code and that way we could display on the screen to our player that the code was wrong and they need to try again okay so the first thing we're going to tackle is checking whether the code is correct on the server and actually firing the rocket on the server so let's get rid of this if statement here and instead we're going to find our remote function now if you haven't got a remote function in your game yet click on the plus in replicating storage and then just type out remote function and just add one in there okay we're good at widget and keep it named right function because it's the only one we have in a in our game so we're gonna say at game don't replicate the storage dot remote function and then what we're going to do is instead of saying fire server we're going to invoke it okay so yeah if you want to trigger a remote function we say we invoke it so we say invoke server now what we're gonna do we need to pass our data to the server we need to tell the server what the client has inputted okay into the textbox and that will be the code obviously so as a parameter we're going to send to the server the contents of our textbox okay because the server actually can't access anything in the player GUI so we need to send that to to the server okay so we've put that as a parameter and that data is going to be sent to the server so now let's go into our server script and actually script how we're going to pick up this request okay this this invoke so in our server scripts let's just put service script here so you know what we're in so scripts and we'll do the same local scripts okay in our service script we are going to set up a listener okay similar to an event listener it's actually what I'm gonna bind our remote function so whenever that gets triggered we're gonna bind it to a function called a callback function I'm explain what one of those is soon so firstly we're gonna say game dot replicated storage dot remote function we put it in replicator storage so it can be viewed by both the server and the client so game don't replicate storage dot remote function now because we've invoked it from the client I'm picking it up on the server we just say dot on server invoke so when the server is invoked because on on the client we said invoke server so on server invoke what we do instead of saying Connect we just say equals function okay and we create a function just as you would in in a normal script if you're making a function to run code now this is called we're binding it to a function so whenever a whenever the remote event is invoked we bind it to this function and any code inside of this function will run whenever we invoke the server invoke that remote event now we've got our arguments the arguments are the data which we pass through the parameters remember we passed our code which the user inputted but we also passed the we also pass the name of the player automatically roblox passes that for us and we don't need to write it in our local script it just automatically pasts but the player comes always comes first on server so it will put our player in first our player argument and you can call these arguments whatever you want so it could be PLR it could be player player you could even say dog but we're gonna say player because that just makes the most sense and then the second one obviously it's going to be our code which they have inputted and that code is going to correspond to textbox dot text okay so now we've got our arguments what we need to do is we need to check to see whether the code is correct okay so we can just say if the code is equal to and then we're going to do a string okay because the text box text is always a string okay if even if it's a number that number is going to be in a string so the code which you want the player to use to launch the rocket you're going to put in here so we could put one three three seven I'm going to change it to one three three seven move just to be different so if the code is equal to one three three seven noob don't forget the two equal signs by the way because it's an if statement so if that is their correct code then we're gonna drop a line make sure that end is added in and then what we can do is we can launch the rocket by saying game dot work space dot rocket model and then we can say a dot launcher dot value equals true okay and again we only just setting it setting the launch of value because there are other scripts in this rocket which which will cause it to take off and what we've done here we've just launched the rocket and we can just do a print to say rocket launched so what we've done so far is the exact same as a remote event we have we have invoked it and fired it as we would with the remote event and we've picked up on the server and we've launched it now if we head into the game and we put in a different code it's not nothing's happening okay but if we put in one three three seven noob you can see it's started to shut the door and launch and if we head into the rocket model not only is it true the value is true for us on the client but it's also true on the server so all clients and the server will be seeing the same thing because they're launching of the rocket and the the setting of this fire too true has been done on the server in a server script this one here because it's been invoked by a remote function and the code was already written ok there we go we're going off in our rocket the code is already written in this script and we were just waiting for the remote function to be invoked by the client and so we've done exactly the same as a remote event but I told you that with the remote function we can return information back to the local script if you're not gonna return information back you might as well just use remote event but we're going to return back whether the code that they entered was the right one or if it was incorrect so if the code is equal to 1 3 3 7 noob then at the end of our at the end of this if statement just before the the end we're gonna say return and this is how we send messages back send information back you say return and the the data that comes after return gets sent back to the local script ok so we could return true ok if it was a success else if the code is wrong then we could return false ok it doesn't matter what you return you could return a string saying true or you could say return you could return correct code it's up to you you could write you could return anything but we're just gonna do true or false for now ok so we're returning that to our local script and it's going to send either true or false back to the local script here ok so returning just means to to send back a value in this case so we're sending back the value true or false to the local script so how do we pick up what we've returned ok we're back in our local script and I'm saying that you can return things but how do we actually get that information well what we do is we take this line of code the invoke invoke server and we're going to set it as a variable okay so local and then I'm gonna call it result so the result is what's going to be returned back so the result is equal to replicate storage remote function invoked server okay and when we do return something say it was returned to true then result would actually equal true okay so the the value that we return basically replaces this line of code okay the invoke server basically recently will return whether it's true or false and then if the result will either be equal to true or equal to false and just to prove this if we say print result here alright and we go and try again and we put in 1 337 new and click launch you can see it returned true but if we just type in something different it returns false okay so its return true or false and then it's been set as the results of variable and there we go it's printed it out so now we can do an if statement to say if results is equal to true then we could say launch button text is equal to success just 1 equals their else if it's if it's not true it's gonna be false we could say launch button text you cause it fail ok and do the same thing again we'll play the game we put in 1 3 3 says fail but if we do 1 3 3 7 new again it says success so it's just it's firing back a value to the local script from this from this server to basically say whether it was whether it was a success or not ok now this is only one use case for a remote function ok you can return back any data so let's say you had a load of items that in a shop which have stored on the server you could return back a table with information about those items like the name from the price and the the object if you wanted to use it like a viewport frame and I'll be making more videos on how that works with a remote function and in the future I do have some videos which do already use remote functions for things like shops such as my sword fight game series with a shop or the mining simulator shop on my channel but you don't have to return true or false again you could return success or you could return epic fail ok and you could say in the local script if result is equal to success as a string don't forget because we returned it as a string datatype because of those speech marks else if result is equal to epic fail then again it would say fail okay so that is how a remote function works okay it's the same as remote events okay it does an action on the server when you call it from a local script but the only difference is that a remote function will return some data to the local script if you're not returning any data use if you're not planning to use a remote event if you're planning on returning something back to the to the local script though like whether it was a success or not or also another example is if you're trying to buy something okay you always want to do the checking to see if they have enough money or deducting the money on the server so that can't be exported and then if the player doesn't have enough money you can return back to the local script to say that they haven't got enough or if they do have enough money you could return back saying it was a success and that they now have the item so if you aren't returning user remote events and also I need to tell you this a remote function yields okay yields okay that was pretty hard to say yields okay if you didn't know what I said yields okay what that means is if it yields then nothing nothing else in this local script is going to run until you have returned a value okay so if we called the right function here the local scripts going to stop until all of the code has been executed in the sell script until you've returned something okay so the script the local script won't continue until you have got something returned from the remote function okay and that's why the success text we're checking to see if resolve was equal to success but you can't do this if statement until you have something returned to your result value like a true or false value so remote function invokes server it yields and that just means that the script will stop at this line until something is returned back to the local scripts whereas a remote event wouldn't because it never returns anything okay so that is all for this video thanks for watching and I'll see you in another one if you have any suggestions
