in this video I'm gonna be showing you how to add HD admin commands to your game now HD admin is a model and allows you to execute a wide range of commands within your game which unlocks a variety of new features and even enables you to earn a row books with minimal setup and difficulty so let's go ahead and get straight into the video alright so the first thing that you're gonna want to do to get HT admin is you want to take the model now I'm gonna leave a link to this model in the description so go ahead and click on the link and then you'll be taken to this page all you need to do is click on get and then get now and the model will be added to your inventory so next you're gonna want to open up a roblox studio so we can add this into your game so go ahead and open it up once your game is open up we're gonna go to the toolbox then I'm in the models we're gonna click on my models and the admin commands should be there so just click on them to add them to your game and in the Explorer panel which you can open up by going to view Explorer you'll see that we've got this folder called HD admin ok and if we go into this folder here you can see we've got a few items in here now we're gonna be focusing on the settings module and you've also got a folder here called custom features now we'll be going over these in more detail in the next videos but the settings module is where you can personalize the admin system for your own needs so for example giving specific ranks to players linking roblox groups to the admin and also things like setting up game passes and which I said we will be going over in a future videos so all that we're gonna do for now is we're going to just publish the game so I'm going to click on file and I'm gonna go publish to roblox as and I'm just going to publish this to a game which I've already created if you want to publish it to a new game of course you can do that as well so I'm gonna go ahead and publish this then I'm gonna copy the link to the game and we're gonna head in and get out okay so we're in the game and you can see in bottom right corner a notification has popped up saying your rank is owner click to view the commands so you don't need to worry about adding yourself into the admin because it is automatically going to give you the owner rank as I own the game or you so what I'm going to do just gonna have a look round in the HD admin and show you what you can do with it so what I'm going to do good open up the main menu and to do this you can click on the HD logo in the top left of the screen and this brings up the the panel okay and we have got five different sections the About section command section special admin and settings in about you can take the model if you haven't already and you can also get in contact with the team that made this admin command system through their social media channels in the commands section you can view a list of all available commands that you can use now you'll see that the commands here are grouped to a different rank so we've got non admin VIP etc and the commands they become more abusive as you go down the list so for example a VIP wouldn't be able to do too much damage but if we look at say like an owner they can do things that just crash the server shut it down etc so if you want to find out some more information about our command you can either search it or find it in the list so I'm just going to have a look at the kill command so I'm just going to search that and if we click it you'll see it gives us some information about that command to execute a command just say the prefix which is by default set to a semicolon and then you just want to write the name of the command so in this case we're gonna do jump which will make my pledge jump up into the air and then you want to write the player who you want this command to be performed on so if you want to do it to yourself just write me and that will make yourself jump but if you want to do it to another player you could say jump and then their name so in this case Alvin underscore blocks and that would do the same but you can choose who to do it to but you don't have to enter the full name of a player so for example you could just say jump out and that all do the same as long as you know there's not a more than one player who has the same prefix in their name so if you had Alvin 1 and Alvin and you said jump owl you need to make sure that you know who you want to do it you don't need to worry about cases either so you could do it in in uppercase or lowercase let's just show you this you could say jump in up and down and then you can write their name as well like that and it does the same as well as this you can also run multiple commands at once so we can say sparkles me fire me and explode me I will run all three commands at the same time so we've got aliases which are other words which you can use instead of saying kill but it will still execute the same command so I could say die me instead of kill me at the description obviously tells you more about the command the rack is the required rank needed to execute this command so in order to kill someone you need to be a mod or higher and we've also got the loop here so if a command is a loopable so we can run it over and over again and if I wanted to kill myself multiple times just loop it indefinitely I could say my prefix which is a semicolon and then kill but instead of just saying kill I'm gonna add a loop before it so we're gonna say loop kill and then the name of the player that you want to loop kill so in this case that's going to be me okay we'll just start killing me over and over again until I break the loop and to break the loop you can say refresh and then the player that you want to break the loop okay so we can just say refresh me and that will just stop the loop from killing me okay so that is looping a command if you want to loop it for a set number of iterations so say 10 times you can do the same thing so let's say loop kill me fine okay and that's just gonna kill me five times in a row okay so I'm just gonna refresh myself again to break that loop if you'd like to undo a command that's pretty simple as well for example if we go ahead and do fire to give ourselves some fire you can see that if I wanted to undo that and get rid of the fire I can just say own fire me and there you go the fire has been removed from my character that is the end of part 1 in this series and how to set up HD admin now if you're interested in how to set up ranks for other players in your
