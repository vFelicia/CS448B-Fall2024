hello and welcome to episode 11 in my scripting series today we're going to be looking at if statements so if statements they allow you to run code depending on whether something has happened or if something or a condition or something that we tell the script is true or not so for example if the time of day is nighttime then we can turn our light on or if two plus two is equal to four which it is then we can do something so firstly when we're doing an if statement we have to say if and that basically tells the script that this is an if statement and we're checking something so an if statement is made up of an ifthen and an end so we have if and then we have something that goes in between if and then and if whatever we put here is correct if it's true if you know if it's if it's right then it's going to run whatever code goes in between these two lines so if I was to print out correct and I was to put something in here obviously it has to be right this is a condition it has to be something that we can check so for example we could check to see if a number add another number was equal to four so if to add two is equal to four then it's gonna print correct now let's run this script and see what happens well there we go prints correct so what's what it's done is it's basically said right is to add to equal to four while two plus two is equal to four so this condition is true and whenever the condition is true then it's always going to print correct now if I put false then it's not gonna say correct because the condition that we've put in here is false now I know we've written false but basically when an if statement sees a condition which is false then it won't run the code inside of it when it sees true then it will run the code inside of it but what we did we didn't say whether 2+2 was 4 or not we didn't say that was true so what happens is when you put a condition in here like 2 plus 2 is equal to 4 it's gonna work it out and then if it is correct then it's either gonna be true or it's gonna be false when it's false it doesn't run anything inside of the if statement when it's true it does so our conditions can either be true or they can be false and depending on whether they are it's whether the code will run or not so these conditions you think about them as like the scripts checks them and they're either true or false and if they're false it won't run if it's true it will run the code inside of the if statement so what do we want to check well you can check properties of things so we could check to see if the time of day was night time so let's look in the lighting the lighting has a property called time of day and if we were to say if game lighting dots time of day and because it's a string a time of day the data types are string then or by the way when we're checking something and we want to say if something is equal to something we always have to do a double equals and this is because when we're setting a value if we were to set the time of day we would say equals and then we'd put the time of day in there so we're setting time of day to be 12 o'clock but if we were to have one equals the script would think that we're setting the value to 12 o'clock but we actually just want to check it we want to see if it's equal to something we want to see if it's equal to 12 o'clock so because it thinks we want to set it to 12 o'clock we have to do a double equals so whenever you're in leaf statement just make sure that you have two equal signs when you check in something that's just the way it is because it's not going to work if you just have one so make sure you have two in there so we're gonna do a string we're gonna do 12 o'clock because it's not a number at time of day time of days of string because it's got these are colons in the middle it didn't have the colon then it wouldn't be but that's just the way it's formatted so it's a string so we can say if time of day is at 12 o'clock then make it correct the work then prints out correct so if we clear the output and run the game it's currently set to a 14 or 2 o'clock so it's not going to print correct but if we were to change the time of day to 12 o'clock and run it again you can see it prints correct now this if statement is only gonna run once it's only gonna run once the game starts and then if you change the lighting later on it won't it won't update so if we start it off and reset and the time is currently at 3 o'clock and we change it to 12 o'clock you can see it doesn't print out correct that's because the if statement has already run it says run once and it's it's it's not printed correct because the time of day wasn't 12 o'clock when we started the game it was 15 or 3 o'clock so only runs once and then once it's already run it'll just move on it won't it won't keep checking like an event keeps running won't do that it will only keep it will only keep checking if you put it in a while loop and I'm not sure if we've done a while loop yet but a while loop will just keep repeating any code inside of it like this if we were to do this every one second in our while loop it would constantly check and now if we change the time of day to 12 o'clock every one second it will keep checking and there we go it's correct because the time is now 12 o'clock if you change you back to 15 or 14 or 00 you can see it's it's it just say correct still but you can see it's not increasing over here where it goes times 7 is just because if we want to clear the output you see it still wouldn't print the message so that is what an if statement is really you say if you put a condition in there if the condition is right then it will run the code inside of it if it's not right it won't so let's get rid of this ifs take this wire loop here now I'm gonna show you another thing here going to show you else now if you say else if this condition is false then it will immediately run the whatever's in between the elves and the end so if you were to print incorrect what would happen is it would say well let's this is the time of day twelve o'clock I know it's not as three o'clock so it's not gonna print correct it's gonna go else because if if the time date isn't twelve o'clock if our conditions false this is our backup this is what's gonna run if it's if it's if it's false so what will happen when condition is false so when the conditions false it will print incorrect and I'll just show you that it prints incorrect because the time of day is fifteen if you were to go back change it to 12 which is defined as in the script boom it prints correct so you can see if the condition is false then it will do the else it will print what I was in between the elves on the end if it's true it will print whatever is between the if and the elves over here so it will print the correct if it's true it will print the incorrect if it is false so you can apply an if statement to anything in your game you could say if the time of day is zero 0 which is nighttime then we could set this light to be unable to explain the work space dot light dot point lights dot enabled equals true else game work space got lights got point lights got enabled equals false okay so if the time of day is midnight then it will turn this light on else it will not so currently it is not a zero zero all we have an error my bad about work space wrong give me a second there we go I say if it is midnight it will turn on obviously it isn't midnight right now it's 12 o'clock so let's go out let's change it to midnight there we go and let's run the code and boom the light turns on now if we were to put this in a while loop so it constantly checks even after it's we run the first time let's do a while wait in there so it just updates every nought point three seconds and again you don't need to know about while loops yet because we'll go over them in a future video if I change it to 215 it turns off if I change it to twelve still doesn't work if I change it to 1159 and 59 it still doesn't work I change it to zero boom it turns on turn it to zero zero one turns off so you can see that an if statement the condition is if it's equal to midnight so if it's one minute past midnight won't work so an if statement your condition determines whether something happens or not so you can see if the condition is true if it is midnight the light will turn on else if it isn't it will turn off so you can see what if statements are they allow you to enter a condition if the condition is true then it will run one set of code if not you can get it to run a different set of codes so very brief introduction into if statements there we will be going more in depth on them later on but you just need to know how they work you can also do things such as if a variable is greater than a number so let's say my var is equal to 20 my var is 20 so it's greater than 10 so the light should turn on there we go but if I was to set my VAR to 2 which is less than 10 it wouldn't work so you can have loads of different conditions you could have my VAR sets of hello and then you could say if my bar is equal to hello then it will run the true we will run the turning on other light because it's true but if you said if it's by while we've set it to say hello it won't run so lots of different use cases for if statements you may be thinking well a bit pointless at the minute because I've got nothing to check but when you make again there are loads of things that you need to check you'll need to check how many players are left in your game because you might want to end the round if there's only one person remaining loads of uses and it's a thing that you really need to know so very brief introduction into if statements we'll be doing more of them in future
