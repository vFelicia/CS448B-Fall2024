in this miniseries I'm going to show you how to create a Tycoon on Roblox in 2024 so first thing you want to do is click on the base plate over here uh we're just going to load up the simplest template that you can get for a Roblox game which is this Bas plate so I'm just going to close down these panels the only panels that you want to have open are the Explorer and the properties window which you can find up here in the top left corner so just make sure that Explorer and properties are selected and you'll be good to go so the very first thing that we want to do is we want to be able to assign a plot to a player um so I'm going to insert a part by clicking on this part button in the Home tab and then I'm just going to scale it so that it is the size of a plot which is typically around 100 studs so in the properties panel I'm going to set this to 100 by 1 by 100 Okay so here is our plot and I'm just going to drag it away from one of the spawn points uh I'm going to go back to the properties panel and I'm just going to name this plot and I'm going to make sure that the anchored box is checked so that it doesn't move around and uh can Collide we'll make sure that is also checked so that the player can collide with it okay so we've created a plot uh now let's just create a few more um because we obviously want multiple players in the game so so I'm just going to press contrl and D to duplicate them anytime I say uh control uh just use command if you're on a Mac okay so I've just duplicated these and we now have eight plots so you can now go to the Explorer panel and just select all of your plots here right click and choose group as a folder and then we're going to name this folder uh I'm just going to call it plots Okay so we've got all of our plots organized in here now what we're going to do is we're going to write some code um which will when when a player joins the game it will choose one of these plots that's available and it will mark it as being occupied okay so to do this let's go into the server script service and let's select script and then I'm just going to call this script plot Handler okay just so we know what it does and then in our script we are going to just create create a variable which will reference this plots um folder so we can say local plots equals game. workspace do plots okay because the plots folder is in the workspace it's good to just have a reference to this because we're going to be using it quite quite a lot um so we've just got it so we can easily say plots instead of gamew workpace dotplots all of the time uh now we need some code for when a player joins the game okay so this is just their comments I'm just going to leave a couple of these in the script so you know uh what each part of the code does it's like a note to self but we're going to say game do players do player added Cod on connect function and then we have a pair of brackets or parenthesis we've got our closing end tag here and we are going to have an argument which is going to be the player who joins so anything we do to this player argument here will be done to a new player who joins so what we want to do is we want to get a plot for them and there's going to be a plot available in our folder so we want to find the first plot that isn't taken and so what we're going to do is when we give a player a plot we're going to set an attribute of the specific plot so say we chose this plot for our player okay we need to mark it as being taken so that the next player can't take it and to do this we will set an attribute okay so what we're going to do is we're going going to set an attribute in this code which is going to be called taken so what we can do is we can just go back to our code here and we can say for uh underscore comma plot in plots colon get children do and this is going to Loop through every single plot in that folder and we want to firstly make sure it's not taken so we can say if uh if um plot colon get attribute taken okay then continue end and that is just going to skip over this specific plot it's just going to go straight to the next one because we've said this one don't even bother because it's taken okay and so if any code here is running then it means the plot is not taken so we want to we want to take it ourselves and so what we're going to do is we're going to say plot colon set attribute taken we're going to set it to true so we're now marking this plot as being taken so up here we're checking to see if it's already taken if it is we're just going to continue it's going to move on to the next one if it isn't taken not taken then it's just going to set it as being taken and we found our plot so uh what I'm also going to do is I'm going to set another attribute of this plot and I want to call it the owner right because we want to store the player who now owns this plot so we're going to say player. user ID we're just setting a value inside this plot inside its attribute uh attributes uh table just so we now know that yes this plot is taken and yes we know who owns this plot so the next thing is when a player leaves the game right we need to mark their plot as available again so we're just going to say game do players uh do player removing this time colon connect function player so we know which player left and same thing really we're going to Loop through that plots folder just like this and we want to check to see if the plot That We're looping through is owned by this specific player and if so we can say if plot get attribute owner um in fact we'll say yes so if plot get attribute owner if not get sorry so if not plot get attribute owner then continue end that means if it doesn't exist because the plot might not have an owner so if the code down here is running if it gets to this stage then the plot is owned by a player now we have to check that it's the specific player that's leaving the game to find their plot so if uh plot get attribute owner is not equal to the player. user ID then again we want to continue because it's not the specific player we want but if the code so I'm just going to scroll down for you as well cuz I know it's just coming off the screen and so if it gets to this point we know that we have found the correct plot so we're going to say plot set attributes taken and we're going to set that to um false you could set it to false or you could set it to nil it doesn't really matter um and we're going to say plot set attribute attribute owner uh let's just set them both to nil yeah because I think if we set it to nil it will remove the attribute so we have now written the code that is going to I'm just going to zoom out for you as well so we've now written the code which is going to um handle the giving and removing of plot when when player joins the game and we can just test this by saying print uh plot has been given to dot do player. name dott dot exclanation Mark if you wanted to and we can do the same down here plot has been removed uh from players. name and I think that should be good to go um we can give it a test so we just go to the um testing window up here in the top left corner click on test click on play and then we'll see what happens and we go to the output okay so it says uh plot has been given to Alvin unor blocks however it has printed that out eight times so what's happened here is it's looped through every single plot in the folder and it's given every single word to me uh we only wanted it to give one and that is because we didn't kill the loop so we have a let me just zoom out so we have two Loops here right and it's looping through every single plot so all of this code inside the loop will be done to every plot unless it is taken um but once we found our plot and we've given it to our specific player that joined we're just going to say break okay and that will that will kill the loop it will say right we've done everything we need you can just stop this now you can stop looping through any other the plots and we'll do the same thing down here so we'll just put a break we'll click on play again and this time you should only see that it has printed out once yeah it's only printed out once this time uh and if we go to our Explorer we have a look in the plots I'm just going to move the properties window alongside here um but as we just look at the attributes we can see the first plot has been given to us so the owner uh has my user ID which is 1494 3069 and the taken uh value is true and if we look at the other plots they don't have those attributes I just accidentally dragged one out there but yeah they don't have those attributes only one of them does so we have now been given a specific plot which is awesome um and the next uh thing that we're going to need to do is we are going to need to start working on things like setting up buttons and having things to buy so you can watch that by clicking on the thumbnail on the screen now and I'll see you there thanks for watching
