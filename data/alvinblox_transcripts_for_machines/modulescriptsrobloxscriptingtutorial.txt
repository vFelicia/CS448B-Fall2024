today I'm going to be showing you how to use module scripts in Roblox so what is a module script well you've probably seen it quite a lot when you insert a blank module script you get this and essentially what it is is it's just a table that gets returned but what does return mean well normal scripts when you start the game they start running immediately server scripts for example whenever the server is created those scripts will start executing so any code in them will run immediately same goes with local scripts although the only difference there is that they don't run on the server they run on the client so on a player's computer or device when they join the game however a module script doesn't run straight away it only runs well runs when it's required and that actually means it's being run inside another script so the code that you write in a module script will only be run in either a script or a local script depending on where it's required from so you can think of it as like a temporary storage okay you're writing some code that isn't going to execute when the when the game uh starts it's only going to execute when we call it from another script and then technically it will be running inside that script so let me give you an example here this module is currently empty because it's just an empty table but what we usually do is we insert functions in here which we want to call at a later time for example if I was to create a function called uh Delete base plate okay what I'd do is I would say module. delete base plate equals function like this okay and then I would just have some code that would delete the base plate shout out to the AI code assist there for inserting that for me and if I wanted to call this function well I would have to call it from another script because module scripts do not run by themselves by their own accord they have to be called from within a script or local script so let's just get rid of this code from my other video how do we run the delete base plate function from my script well firstly you have to get the module script so we'll create a variable called module script and we'll say script. parent wait for child module script now this isn't it because we have only got a reference to the object this is merely just a reference to the properties of this module script we haven't been able to extract the function out of this module script so how do we do that well we need to get this table within our module that gets returned because delete base plate is a function within our module here because I've said module. delete base plate that means that delete base plate is within our module table and this module table gets returned by our module script and what that means is whenever we get the module and we use a specific function on that module it's going to return this table so what is that specific function well that specific function is called require and that just means give us what gets returned by this module okay so rather than this being a reference to the module script instance itself this becomes a reference to Whatever Gets returned by that module which in this case is this table which contains our function so requ lets you get the contents of the module and then because this is now a reference to the contents of that table within our module we can say dot and you see that it starts to autocomplete the delete base plate and so now we've just called our module script delete base plate function from outside of the module however because we've required the module into our script you can think of the module as just an extension of our script here it's giving us access to the function fun ality of the module but the functions themselves haven't actually been declared within this script but that's okay because we have a reference to them so you can think of the code inside this module is actually running inside our script when we call the function if there's an error in our module it's going to cause an error in our script so that's it basically if we were to run this this uh this this game you can see the Bas plate gets destroyed not because the module script is running straight away if I was to disable our normal script and click on run the base plate would remain there because like I said the module script doesn't run when the game starts it only runs when it gets required well I say that the the functions themselves aren't running when we require the module they only are running when we call the functions and that's what we're doing here so so let's just reenable our script and now that I've shown you how a module Works how can you use other people's modules because the great thing about module scripts is it allows us to use code written by other people rather easily because when modules are created they're created in a way that they're designed to be easily used by other scriptors you don't have to have thousands of lines of code you can just insert a module and use the specific functions where you want to so let me give you some examples of modules that I commonly use okay here's the profile service from Lis and this is useful for data storage and it just handles all of the different edge cases that you might encounter with data stores things like session locking what if somebody is in a game with their with their data store open and someone tries to access it from another server and tries to overwrite it these are sort of issues that you will encounter if you're working on data stores but luckily Lis came up with a massive module which handles all of this stuff for us so why invent the wheel when someone else is already done it so all I'd need to do is just require script wait for child profile service set that as a variable like this and then you have access to all of these different functions and properties of the profile service for example I would then want to get a profile store which you know I could say profile service. getet profile store and I'll give the name of my data store I could give the template of my data store and then I'm I'm good to go I have access to all of the functions like load profile which would load somebody's data um that I would need in order to make my data stores work okay and that's just one data store module there's loads of data store modules out there but you will find lots of modules on Roblox created by other users and all you need to do to use them is just require them and as soon as you've required them you'll probably then find some documentation for that module which shows you all of the different functions that you can call all of the different properties or uh that you can access from that module so very very useful so that is how module scripts work how you can have your own functions in module scripts and how you can call them at a specific time so if you found it useful please leave a like Please Subscribe let me know if there's any other videos which you'd like to see and I'll catch you in the next one thank you for watching
