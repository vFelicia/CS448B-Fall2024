okay I'm going to demonstrate what a vector 3 is in Roblox so a vector 3 is simply a way of representing some data now in this case we want to have three numbers to represent something a vector 3 can be used for many different properties but mainly we use it to represent position of an object in the world now in roadblocks we represent position by three numbers telling us how far away on each axis an item is from the spawn well the center of the world which is where the spawn point is and in this case you can see that our part over here is 14 4 STS on the x axis away from the origin 0.5 STS away on the Y AIS and 26 STS away on the Zed axis so we have these three numbers which all come together to represent a position because it's telling us how far away on each axis the part is from the spawn point from the origin yeah I'll clarify it is the spawn it is the origin and not the spawn point we're talking about because the spawn point could obviously move but the origin which is 0000 0 somewhere around here would remain the same so that is just one way that a vector 3 is commonly used but a vector 3 has nothing to do with position because like I say a vector 3 could be used to represent some other type of of data but normally we use it to represent a position because it's a great way of storing three numbers which are uh relative to each other right they all have some similar sort of meaning it wouldn't make sense to just store the X store the Y and Store The Zed as three separate variables when we could just store it in one vector and we could refer to them by saying vector dox vector doy vector. Z so a vector 3 is essentially a container for three numbers but it represents a Direction normally or a position now the other cool thing about Vector 3es is you can add them together so you could have um uh we'll create a variable for Vector number two and I know this is going to get confusing because I've just referred to it as Vector number two and we now have Vector 3 but let's just assume we have two vectors and I could have a total vector by saying Vector plus Vector number two and that would be all of these numbers adding to each other so the X will be added to the x X the Y will be added to the Y and you will get one new Vector so in this case if we were to print out total Vector we should get 0 1 0 because we're adding nothing because this is just three Z values to 0 1 Z so it should stay the same but if this was to be 5 55 we should get 5 65 because we're adding one to the Y value so the X and Zed values remain unchanged but because we we've changed the Y we've added one to it we should get 5 65 so let's click on run and there we go it's added our two vectors together Vector 3es so that is essentially how Vector 3 works and of course you can set a part position by saying part. position equals and then you supply a vector 3 value and this total Vector is a vector three because we've just added two other Vector 3es together and if we click on run you'll see that the part has moved to over here okay so that is how Vector 3 Works in roadblocks very simple way of uh representing points in the world vectors which is a direction of travel uh because you can just provide three numbers and it's usually used for positions positioning objects with a script so thank you for watching leave a like if you enjoyed it subscribe of course and let me know if you have any more suggestions for future videos
