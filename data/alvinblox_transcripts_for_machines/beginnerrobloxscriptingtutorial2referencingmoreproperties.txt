welcome back to the second video in my scripting series now if you're enjoying the series so far please don't forget to give me a like on the video and subscribe if you're interested in more scripting content so in the previous video and if you haven't already seen that video by the way I recommend you go and watch it I'll leave a card to it in the top right corner of the screen and link in the description the previous video was about properties and we also went over roblox to do a little bit so we'll definitely recommend watching that first now we're gonna go over properties a little bit more in this video but it won't be as long as last time now you might be getting a little bit bored of doing properties and I know you want to jump to the good stuff but we have to learn this stuff because it is vital which you need to know and if you don't then you'll get confused later on so let's say you have a brick okay or part or any objects and you give it a name such as my brick okay but you have a space in the name alright that's fair enough so let's go into the script and now let's try and reference it so it softly game dot workspace and the brick we're gonna say dot my brick okay so my brick dock transparency equals one right it doesn't seem to like the name of this obviously because it's got a space in it and Lua won't allow spaces in names so when we go and run this and it's not going to go transparent because the script has encountered an error so when a script encounters an error is going to stop and you're not going to see the expected result so we're gonna open up the output and the output will allow us to debug our scripts now don't worry about this stuff this is just because plugins I have which don't work but you can see here the script has given us a message so it's saying sir script service dot scripts that's telling us where the script is so here it is and it's saying one so one means the line number you can see how it counts the lines as you go down so it's telling us which line it's stopped on so line one and it says and equals expected near brick and we've got on equals but the issue is because of this red line because of this name so how do we get around this if you've got a space in the name of your instance or objects you can put it in square brackets okay so you're not going to need the dot over here by workspace but you're going to need it by Transparency so instead of saying game that workspace dot my brick we can do square brackets and then inside of these square brackets we can do quotation marks or speech marks and then you can write the name of the brick no problem because it's a string and a string is a data type of text and which is acceptable by roblox so this time if we go and try try it out it goes fully transparent and if we look in the output there's no errors from our script okay so that's the first thing I had to get around the second problem is if your name is a number okay so 56 okay and we try and do the same thing again game don't work space dot fiftysix dot transparency equals one this is gonna cause an error as well because you can't just have what is because the name property of a part is is a string and a string is text and a string should be written like this okay because the data which goes into this this name property is a text not a number and we have to again put it in a string so you can't just put numbers like this because it would just go blue and then the script will get confused again so again square brackets and as a string I just in speech marks like this we put 56 and then we need the dot after the square brackets to indicate what property we're trying and again we're in the game and it will go transparent so that's they are just a couple of things that you could have when you're trying to reference apart and again another problem you may face is let's say you are finding a part in the workspace and we call this part of gravity okay but the workspace also has a property called gravity so we have a part called gravity in the workspace and a property of workspace called gravity so when we say gamed it works list of gravity how does the script know that we want to change this property of workspace or whether we want to reference and access the part called gravity what you'll want to do if you want to get to the property then it's gonna by default find this property okay it's gonna go to this first but if you actually just want to find the the name of that you want to find the power instead of doing a dot you could say code on find first child and what find first child does is it looks for only the things inside of workspace so we're not talking about the properties here a child as I said is something inside of another thing so these parts camera terrain base pay and gravity are all part of the workspace they're all children of the workspace so we're finding the first child with a name gravity and then you can do something like setting the transparency to not point five okay so try that again and there you go it goes half transparent but again if we had just said gravity transparency and there we go and run the game it's got confused because it's gone to the workspace it looked at its property called gravity and it's try to set it to a number but what no it's try to set it transparency because it's trying to find a property of this property and you can't have a property of a property so they're just a couple things which could go wrong and I've shown you how to get around them by using square brackets and speech marks another problem which you might have is if you have two parts that have the same name so if we have let us change this from gravity to I don't know dog okay and we clone this part and we now have two parts called dog and then what if you wanted to say game dot work space dog dot transparency right because you want to make them both transparent well you can if you try and do this it's going to only set the transparency of one of them okay and this is because the script it can't tell them apart because they have the same name so it goes into the workspace and it only picks one of them it only picks the first one which it finds so you're gonna have to name one of them dog one and the other one dog two and then you're gonna have to change the transparency of dog one and dog two on two different lines like this so it's only going to it's only going to pick one when they have the same name and one more thing that I want to go over we had an error earlier in our code and these can happen these errors can appear quite a lot when you're scripting so don't be disheartened if you get an error because usually most the time they are really easy to fix okay so let's try and let's firstly insert another part okay and we'll just keep it named part if you make a simple capitalization or spelling mistake and the scripts gonna error so for example she said Gamay into the game got workspace dot parts dots brick color it was brick color dot new and we give it really red you can see it's highlighted that you've you've made it a mistake and it's saying unknown global because it doesn't know what what you may means right and if you try and run it it's going to have an error so if you ever get an error make sure you've checked to see if you're spelling things right and attempt index global may and no value that's because it's tried to find may but it can't find it and the same thing goes for things like if you spell something with lowercase okay it worked that time because you can you can actually say workspace in in lowercase because it's a service but if you said say part with lowercase okay but it's actually got a capital letter too big to start off with and we run this it's trying to find the the name exactly how we wrote it so part and said parts is not a vibe member of workspace that just means it can't find a brick called part as you've actually spelt it with a capital P in the workspace okay because you could have two parts one spelt with lowercase one spoke normally okay and that would be the way to distinguish between them so you have to make sure that you get the spelling capitalization and everything correct I'm not sure if it's the same with Britt with properties I wouldn't think so yeah exactly so you can you don't have to you know get the capitalization correct but it's good practice to on things like brick when you're stating the name of the property but I think if you did something like a spelling mistake like this and you said brick claw it's gonna get confused okay yeah it's trying to find a brick claw but you can't find it and the same thing goes for if you make a spelling mistake in in the name of your color it's gonna error so always make sure you spell everything correctly and you you're using capital letters correctly etc okay what you should do as you keep scripting is you know just keep checking your scripts as you write them to make sure that the capitalization is right and that you've spelled everything correctly so and that way you reduce the chance of making mistakes and having to then debug them later on and also if you get an error and you don't know what is wrong with it you can always ask people online you can go to places such as the roblox developer forum or ask a friend but it's good if you're trying to work out fixes to your own errors and mistakes because that way it will help you later on when you're trying to solve more complex problems and and it builds your problemsolving skills and you won't have to ask for help all the time so arrows are good and they can be annoying at times but you just have to deal with them you have to try and solve them think logically and you know don't be disheartened if you can't find the the solution yet so I think that was everything that I was gonna cover in this video I wanted it to be a lot shorter than the last one if you do want to go to the next video then I'll leave a thumbnail on the screen right now which you know and click there we an arrow to it and don't forget to subscribe to my channel Alvin blocks there'll be a logo on screen as
