okay in this video I'm going to show you how people cheat or exploit in Roblox games so usually what happens here is you have remote events which let clients and server communicate with each other you might have a remote event for example which gives you some cash right say you step on a a button okay um actually that's not a good example uh a good example would be uh buy item okay so if we had a remote event that buys item and say game. replicated storage bu item blah blah blah okay player whatever what happens is so you have you have the cost of the item which is stored on the server and the player will fire this remote event because they want to buy an item and you don't check on the server to see if they have enough money you just give it to them straight away so this is like one of the number one ways that that the games get exploited because you don't do proper check on the server before you give the player the item okay and what happens is you know you might have um you know what happens to to fix this is you would just literally say if player. leer stats doc. Val is greater than or equal to item cost then you would give them the item okay it's as simple as that but a lot of the time developers would check this on the client okay when they press the button they check it on the client but that's no good because exploiters can just fire the remote event from their their own software right so they will basically jump over your little check in the button so you have to do the checks on the server to make sure that the player has actually got enough um coins because the player can change their coins value or their cash value on their end from using their exploit equipment you know if if if I'm an exploiter I can change my cash to say .5 billion when in fact if you look at it on the server I actually only have zero cash still so they can on their end on the client's end they can make it look like they have enough money and so if you're not checking this on the server all right then um you know because when they change something on their end the server rejects that change so the server is not going to accept that change which is why it says that they have 1 billion cash but to the rest of the game and to the other players they still have zero because the server doesn't let that go through um so if you check things on the server then you're obviously not going to let the player um get around that so that's just a very simple explanation of one of the ways in which Roblox games are uh vulnerable uh typically new developers will realize this they might release a game realize that it's super easy to um to break through and uh give things to exploiters so I think I'll do a couple more videos on this explaining ways in which uh you can secure up your Roblox games so let me know uh what other sort of videos you'd like to see as always subscribe and I'll see you in the next one
