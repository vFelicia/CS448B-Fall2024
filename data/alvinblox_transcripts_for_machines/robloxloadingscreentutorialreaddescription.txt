right I'm gonna show you how to add a loading screen to your roblox game so firstly go ahead and create a loading GUI so I'm gonna insert a screen GI and start GUI I'm gonna call this loading screen and side of here I'm gonna add a frame now this frame I'm gonna set the size to 1 comma 0 comma 1 comma 0 ok so it fills up the entirety of the xaxis and the entirety of the yaxis okay I'm also gonna set border size pixel to 0 and then inside of there I'm gonna insert a text label now you don't have to make your GUI the same as mine I'm just making it really basic so I'm gonna go to my text label I'm gonna set the position to naught point 5 comments 0 comic naught point 5 comma 0 so this in the middle of both axes and then I'm gonna set the anchor point to not 0.5 and 0.5 so it is truly in the middle you can see the anchor point that's now in the middle and then I'm going to set the border size pixels to 0 and the size I'll just keep that the same I only set text scaled to be checked I'll change the font a bit as well and I'll set the text to say loading ok you can do some extra code if you want to make the GUI look nice maybe make these gee these loading dots and animate or flash or something but once you've got your GUI and we're gonna go and place it well first we're gonna go into replicate it first and insert a local script into there then take your loading screen and paste the GUI into that local scripts now if you didn't know what became his first is replicated first basically anything inside a run hit first it's gonna be replicated to all clients so players in the game and therefore anything else is okay so it's not store on server the server doesn't see it it's only for storing things that go to the clients in the game in this case the loading screen because only the players you can see the loading screen not the server so we firstly need to remove the default loading screen and the default loading screen you might you may have seen it before it looks like this okay and it just basically plays until the game is loaded so let's go back in here and to disable it all you have to do is say game first and say remove default loading screen okay and that is gonna remove it you may see it very quickly but it won't be it won't stay on the screen for a prolonged amount of time okay even when the game has pretty much loaded so next we need to get the players player GUI so local player GUI and player GUI is where all of their GUI elements are stored you might say oh well they're stalling startegy or actually but that's not true they get replicated or cloned into player GUI when they join the game so we can wait for that to be added in by saying game got players dots local player curran wait for child player GUI and once we've got that we can say player GUI come on set top bar transparency to zero now we're doing this whoops put nine I mean zero we're doing this because we don't want the player to see anything going on in the game whilst it's still loading that will just make it opaque so we can't see through it next thing when you do need to clone the GUI so we'd say local GUI equals script dots the loading screen curl on clone so just make a duplicate of it and then we can say GUI dot parent equals player GUI so we're just putting it into players play GUI so they can see it and then you can do a weight here so you could either wait for a certain number of seconds and then after that amount of seconds you could tween the GUI offscreen so you could say GUI door frame tween position you could say you dim to new zero zero one zero so it just goes off the screen goes downwards I think say in out or another easing direction or easing style I'm gonna use sign and I'm going to set it to null point five and that will just release that will smoothly tween it then after no point five seconds I'm gonna say GUI destroyed okay so it's destroyed from the player GUI and I won't come back when they reset okay so now that we've done that I said you can either wait five seconds or you could say repeat wait repeat Waits one until game is loaded okay and that's gonna play the GUI until the games loaded if you've got a game that doesn't take long to load the players won't see the loading GUI very long so you could just keep it to a wait five but bear in mind the game may not fully be loaded by then and you can change this wait number to have many seconds you want it to be on screen for okay so let's go and check it out I'm gonna click on play and let's see if our load UI works so the goats is loading loading loading and then actually about five seconds about now it goes off screen and if we try and reset it won't come back up because it got destroyed from our player GUI so there we go we've just created a loading screen in roblox to do so if you enjoy this video please leave a like don't forget subscribe and if you want to take the code from this video you can become a channel member by clicking the join
