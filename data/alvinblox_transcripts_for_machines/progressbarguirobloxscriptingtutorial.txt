how to make a progress bar in roadblocks so firstly you'll need a screen GUI and then you'll need a frame this is going to be our bar so I'm just going to make it cover uh a small section of the screen and I'm going to put it in the middle of the screen like this and then I'm going to just set the Anchor Point so that it's definitely in the middle and now how do we actually make this be an actual bar how do we show a percentage uh as a portion of this Frame Well what we'll do is we'll insert another frame inside of this one and this will be the green section or whatever color you choose I'm going to choose green because your typical progress bar is green and we're going to set the size to be 1 comma 1 so it's going to fill the entirety of the parent frame and you'll notice that we can actually adjust the x width of this uh so it actually looks like a progress bar now what I'm also going to do is I'm just going to add a I corner I'm going to set the corner radius to 1 comma 0 and we're going to right click copy and paste this into our other frame so both of them have got that uh progress bar sorry that UI Corner uh and you will notice one thing and that's when the inser bar the green bar um gets quite small you see that you get this this uh annoying little visual issue now uh how can you fix this well uh I'm not sure to be honest and that's why I typically don't use UI corners on my progress bars but if anyone has a solution for this let me know in the comments anyway back to the general point of how to make a progress bar so what I'll do is I'll name the alter frame the main frame and I'll name this inner one the inser just so that we don't get confused and then what we'll do is we'll insert a local script so I can show you how to code this progress bar so I'm going to create a function I'm going to call it update progress bar and I'm going to take a number into this function which is going to be the percentage and then what we'll do is now I don't want to use code assist please go away thank you to change the progress bar all we need to do is we need to get the inser and then we'll say do size equals udm 2. from scale and we'll put number comma 1 and the number is going to be a value for the X scale so it's going to be between 0 and 1 so when we call this function we need to provide a number between zero and one if we wanted half of the progress bar to be um if want the progress to be here or half you would set the size position to 0.5 if you wanted it to be 3/4 of the way you'd say 0.75 and if you wanted it to be completely full you would say one so let's imagine you have a value of cash 500 cash and let's say you have an achievement which is going to be at 1,000 cach then to get our progress towards the achievement we're going to say cach divided by achievement and then we can update our progress bar with this progress towards the achievement because this is going to return a decimal value between 0er and one and then we can pass this into our upgrade update progress bar uh function and you don't have to use a function you could just say script. main. inset do size equals udm 2. from scale and you could just put that decimal number right in there without having to do any of this function stuff but I like functions because it just makes it look a little bit more neat and and organized so what we'll do is we'll just set our inser size to be0 comma 1 so that we have a progress bar which isn't filled up and we'll click on play and what should happen is yeah there we go it fills half of the way what we could also do is we could set up a changed event if we had this as a leader stat so let me go make a quick leaderboard okay so I've created a quick little leader stats uh script and I've also just added a get property changed signal which will detect when the value changes and when it does we can update the progress bar to have the cash value divided by our achievement value of 1,000 and that will update the progress bar so let's click on play and our leader stats are added so let's just go and change them here we'll set it to one 50 200 300 500 and 1,000 and it's updating our progress bar now there's one small issue which is if we set the value to be greater than a000 the progress bar is going to go off the screen so how do we prevent that well all we have to do is we just need to clamp our number by one so we can say number equals math do clamp number between 0 and one and that means our value will never go over one even if it's greater than one we'll cap it at one so it will never extend to go past the bar and if I set it to 5,000 which is greater than 1,000 you can see the bar does not go past one so that's how you make a progress bar in Roblox Studio I hope you found this video useful if you did please leave a like Please Subscribe and I'll see you in the next one
