so in the last video I showed you how to make the buttons in your Tycoon work however they're sort of useless at the moment because we don't have any currency that we can use to purchase the items so the Tycoon can be completed straight away so I'm going to show you how to add um the cash or money values to your game so that players actually have to spend it in order to unlock things so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go to the Explorer panel and we're going to insert another script um just before we do that though I'm just going to look at this script that we worked on um previously and I realized that we we didn't use it in the end so I was going to have a separate script for the for the buttons but um we ended up putting it all into the plot Handler so that's okay I'm just going to delete that script from last time uh and instead we're going to insert another script and I'm going to call this script um uh data okay cuz it's going to handle the players data such as their currency whatever and then in the code here I'm going to firstly create another player added event so when a player joins a game I'm just going to do a comment here so that we can understand what we're working on so when a player joins the game we're going to say player added code on connect function and we have the argument of the player so we can actually do things to this this player and what we want to do is we want to obviously give them a money value to keep track of how much they've got and we want this to appear in the leaderboards in the top right of the game and to do this we need to uh actually create a folder so we're going to say local folder equals instance. new folder folder. name equals leader stats and you have to make sure leader stats is in lower case complete lower case otherwise this isn't going to work so folder parent equals player so we've created a folder which is going to store all of the players values that we want to appear on the leaderboard such as their cash so we're now going to create that specific cash or money value now I am going to call it cach again you can call it whatever you want but probably for this tutorial it's best to just stick to what I'm doing for now so we're going to insert an INT value okay an integer uh int is short for integer that just means any whole number like 1 2 or three it can store a number as long as it's not got decimal places so cash. name equals cach cash. value we're just going to set that to zero for now and cash. parent equals folder we're putting this cache value into this folder and when a value enters the leader stats folder it will then appear in the top right corner of the screen on the leaderboard so let me show you that right now if I click on the play button and we have a look at the um top right corner here you'll see that we now have a leaderboard so now what we need to do is we need to be able to purchase things right using this value so let's click on the stop button and now we're going to head back to our plot Handler which is where we have got the code for when we touch a button now we're going to want to scroll down to the part where We Touch our button here so around line 30 and what we want to do is we firstly once we've made sure that the player that is touching the button is in fact the owner of the plot we want to make sure they have enough currency so firstly we need to actually get the price of the item that they want to unlock so what we'll do is we will go back to our template plot which is over here and we'll select every single item and then we will click on the attribute in the properties panel we'll click on the plus we will then insert a number attribute and we'll call it price so click on Save and then we're going to insert a price value here so for example 300 in fact you know what we're not going to do that we're going to delete this attribute because rather than having the attribute set to the specific item I think it's better to actually set it to the specific button because we could have um multiple items and rather than just setting the price for each item I think it's better to do it per button so we're going to go down we're going to make sure the button is selected first so this button we're going to go to the properties panel and we're going to insert an attribute we're going to name it uh price and we're going to set the type to number and we're going to set this to let's say 50 for example okay so to unlock this button it will now cost 50 cash so now we've set that up we just need to read it in our script so we're going to get the price value by saying local price I'm just going to zoom in Here Local price equals button K on get attribute price now let's just make sure there is a price value because there might not be a price value we might have forgotten to set up price and if we've done that um then we'll just let the player have the item for free why not but if there is a price then we will say uh if player. lead stats. C.V Val is less than price then we're going to put a message to the output a warn message which is just an orange message saying you cannot afford this item and and then we will just say return and that will kill the script where it is it won't go any further it will kill this event so it will stop here uh until we we press the button again so we've just checked to make sure the player can afford the item uh and if they can't if their cash value is less than the price we will return and if there is no price then this if statement won't run it will just carry on so let's apply the edits and just head back to the game you can just press the play button and it should save your script and I'm just going to pause the video whilst I walk over to the plot so here we are in the plot I've opened up the output window I'm just going to clear it so it's easier to see any new messages and I'm going to step on the button now we have zero cache so what I expect to happen is when I step on the button we should get some messages in the output saying I can't afford the item and the poster shouldn't appear there we go so it's printing out you cannot afford this item and it's printed out 11 times because it's registered 11 separate touches from my different body parts because it keeps touching the item but the good news is we can't afford it now let's just give ourselves some cash to make sure that this is actually working now whenever you're working with leader stats and cash and these sort of values if you want to give yourself some additional cash it's quite easy however you can't do this from your client you have to go into server mode because if you do it on the client uh it won't be registered on the server this is because it's preventing exploiters from changing their own cache so what you need to do is you need to and you can only do this in Roblox Studio but if you click on current client and you set it to server mode what you can then do is go to the Explorer click on the players tab select your player and then select the leader stats folder inside of it and then select the cach value and you you can set this to whatever value you'd like so for example we're going to set it to 500 and when you've done that if you head back to current client by clicking on the current server button which is up here we can now see that we have got 500 cach so this time if we step on the button let's see what happens I'm going to clear the output one more time I'm going to step on our button and there you go we were able to purchase the item however we haven't deducted the 50 cach from our 500 cash so in theory the player could still complete the game very quickly because we're not taking their money away so in order to remove the money very simple we'll just click on the stop button head back to the plot Handler and we're going to then add an else here to our if statement because at this point if the um actually what we could just do is outside of this if statement because it's is going to return if the player can't afford it so if we get to this point we know the player can afford the item so we know there's a price and we know that they can afford it because otherwise it would have returned by now so at this point in the code we can just say player. leer stats. C.V value uh minus equals price and when you say minus equals it takes the current value and it removes this value from it so this is just deducting the price from the leader stats so again let's click on the play button in the top uh left area of the screen and let's try this one more time so I'm going to step on the button let's just uh go and set our cache to 500 again on the server so Explorer leader stats cach we set it to 500 go back to client mode and let's step on the button let's see what happens there we go it took away the cash and we now have 450 so we've just managed to add leader stats which has now taken our Tycoon to the next level the next thing we need to do is we need to add some way of earning cash so we're going to look at how to make a dropper in the next video so I'll see you there if you enjoyed this one please do like share subscribe and I'll see you in the next one
