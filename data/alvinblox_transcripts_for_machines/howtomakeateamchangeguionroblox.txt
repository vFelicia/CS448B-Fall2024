today we're going to create a team change to you I like this one where you can open it up and select which team you want to switch just like in jailbreak and other game so let's get straight into it so firstly let's make the GUI I'm gonna insert a screen GUI into started UI and I'm going to call it team change and then inside of that I'm gonna insert a frame okay now this frame I'm going to set the size to zero so not point three zero not point one seven five zero and that just scales it on the x and y axis and then I'm going to position it in the middle of the screen so we're going to set the anchor point to not point five zero point five so that goes into the middle and then we can position the anchor points and halfway down the screen by setting the position to not point five becomes zero at nor point 5 comma zero now that will put it in the middle of the screen and now we can insert our buttons so I'm gonna I'm gonna insert one text button for now this is going to be the team which we can choose if you want more than two teams then just keep adding these buttons but let's do the first one the first one is going to be for criminals so I'm just going to set it to criminals like that and let's just go and set the size of this this button so I'm going to set it to do not point for for the xaxis comma zero and then not point nine comma zero because we want it to take up the entirety or pretty much nearly all of the yaxis okay and then we can leave a little bit of white space for border so we're in the position I'm not going to set an anchor point because it's inside of that frame locked into it I'm instead gonna set the position to naught point naught three so it's just away from from the side comma 0 and then naught point naught 5 0 okay that'll put it with it with a nice bit of white space around it and I'm going to set the border size pixel to two and let's make the background yellow for criminals and let's just make text scaled checked we can change the font as well if you'd like and I'm going to call the text criminals okay and so we're gonna do exact same thing just copy this and paste it and this is gonna be the second team for the police so we'll change the name to police here and we'll change the position to nought point five seven comma zero and then comment naught point naught 5 comma zero and that will put it same place on the yaxis but just moving it along the x axis okay all right so now if we can go ahead and set the background color of three to a police color and we can change the text to say police okay so now we can start scripting it so let's insert a local script into here local Swift and inside of this local script we're just going to code it so when you click each button your team gets changed okay so first thing that we're gonna need to do is we're going to need to create a remote event okay so that we can tell the server that we want the players team to be changed okay so in replicated storage just add a remote event and I'm going to call this event change team all right so we're gonna say and this is a team change script now firstly we need to add our team's okay so to add the team's into the game we're gonna go back to the game and click on model go to service and make sure that the team service has been added then you can insert a team into this service so add one for police and add one for criminals but so what we've got to do is for each team we've got to assign it a team color so the criminals are going to have a team color of cyan sorry of orange bright orange and the police are going to have cyan and so when you want to assign a team to a player you change a property in in their in their player called the team color if we go into the players service here click on my player and scroll down you can see team color if I was to change that to orange I'd go into the criminals team so we're actually just changing their team color so now that we've got them added select both of them and set Auto assignable to false so they can't be given a team straight away all right and so let's just make a variable for a remote event so local remote event equals gay don't replicate the storage and we can say change team all right because that's our remote events you then are going to say local menu button we're going to assign it to the menu button tsunami add that I'm also going to make a variable for the frame which houses our button so we can say script dots parent curl on wait for child frame and then we're just going to get our team colors here so team colors and so if you are in the police so the police color is going to be cyan and the criminals color is going to be bright orange all right because they are the two colors which we defined over here so just make sure you got some variables for those and then we're just going to do an event so when one of the buttons has been clicked we changed the team so frame dots criminals okay because the criminals at button here is inside of the frame and then we could say dot mouse button one click connect a bracket function and this function is going to fire off the remote event so you can say remote event curl on fire server and then we're gonna say brick color dot new because team colors are brick colors a brick color is basically a color from this palette so not an RGB color made up of three values which we can choose so this is a brick color and so we say brick colored new and then we're gonna say criminal cover okay because let's see criminals color because that is the color we defined up here and so when the criminals button gets clicked we fire the remote event or we fire a motor vent because you can't change a player's team from the clients and because that would be quite dangerous so we can't do that and then if we go back to and back to the script here and just copy this events and paste it but we change criminals to police and then down here in the remote event section we're just gonna change criminals color to police car all right police color and that's all that we need to do now we need to go over to the server script and code it so let's go ahead and do that now we're gonna create a server script in service script service and this is gonna be used to handle the remote events okay because basically local scripts they can't make changes to do with things such as teams so we have the fire and events and then that event gets picked up on the server and the server is able to change it all right you don't need to know too much about that but we're gonna do the team changing in here in the service script so all that we need to say is game replicated storage doctor change team doctor on server event so one that have ents been fired we can connect it to a function and in that function we've got some arguments which is basically some data we've passed over from the local script and that's going to be the player that fired this remote event or wants the team to be changed and the team color alright because we were saying team color here and that's the second bit of data that were passing over we just don't say what player is being sent it automatically gets sent so we're sending the color here and we're picking that up as the team color so all we need to say is player dot team color equals team color and then we can say player per long load character and that's going to respawn them so that they get placed onto and the spawn for that team okay now I've just realized what you also need to do we need to have a team which is auto assigned to the player and when they join because they're going to be choosing so if we just go back here to the team section and we add a new team and we set that so that it is Auto assignable and we just changed the name to be something like choosing this will be given to the players when they join but we're going to keep police and criminals sets so the unassigned ball is unchecked so that they immediately immediately get placed into this team and if we go ahead and run this game it should work for us so I get placed into the choosing team and if I click on criminals it puts me in a criminal team and police puts me on the police side so the last thing that we to do is we need to add a menu button okay so I'm going to add a text button to this GUI and I'm just going to set the anchor point to zero comment not 0.5 so to say it scales perfectly on the yaxis and we're going to set the position to 0 and then comma 10 so 10 pixels offset from the side so that it's not touching the corner of the screen and comma not 0.5 comma 0 okay and that's going to put it in the middle of the screen on the yaxis and if we go ahead and set tech scale to true and we just give it a nice of font and just change the text to say change team then there's our button and if we just change the name of this to be called menu button then we can go back into our local script and now we can use this variable we declared and we can set it to script dot P Hrant curl on wait for child and we can say menu button okay and then down here all we need to say is menu button dot mouse button oneclick curl on connect function and in this function we're just going to set the frames and visibility property to the opposite of what it currently is so we can do that by saying frame not visible echo was not framed dot visible so now if you go and click on the frame and make sure visibles unchecked and we go ahead and play then you can see we get put into the choosing team again if we click on change team it appears we can become a criminal and there we go it goes off our screen again so what that was how you make team changed you I if you liked the video please give a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe and
