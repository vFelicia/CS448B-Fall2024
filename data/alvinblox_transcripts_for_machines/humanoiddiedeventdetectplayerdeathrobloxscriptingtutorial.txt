how do you detect when a player dies in Roblox so when a player resets or when they get killed how do we detect that well firstly you'll need a player added event to detect when a player joins this is all on the server by the way however it should still apply to local script code as well then you need a character added event in order to get the player's character and when you've got the character you can simply say character added sorry you can say character. humanoid DOD colon connect function okay and then we can print out character has died and then you can really do whatever you like um if you wanted to you know reduce the player's points or whether you wanted to um put a system message out there you could do whatever you like really because you've got access to the player you've got access to the character so that's it really let's go and test it out we'll go and reset and you can see it says character has died and then you might want to check to see if they've spawned again and since you've got access to the character added you can print character has spawned one more time we'll reset and it's printed character has died and then in a moment it will print character has spawned now you might be wondering what's the point of doing this why would I ever want to know if a player has died and I wanted to give you a little practical example here so so we'll just create a simple variable for deaths now this isn't designed to be used in in a game because you'd have multiple players this is just assuming you have one player in the game so when a player dies you might want to increase the number of deaths by one and uh in fact what you can do is you can just put this variable in the player added like this so it applies to each player uh and then you could say if deaths is greater than or equal to let's say three then perhaps I want to prompt them to purchase more lives so I could say Marketplace service prompt uh product purchase you know and I could obviously put the the relevant information in there for the um for the for the ID uh for for the player so the game the game pass ID or the product ID uh which I don't have to hand at the moment but you get the idea or perhaps you might even want to kick them out of the game all right cuz you might have an OB where it's like you know three deaths and you die so we'll just say out of lives uh and so we'll click on play and and see if it works so we'll reset once I'll just speed this up for you and twice okay and here it comes the third death so uh yes it's kicked me from the game okay you can see the physics have stopped got the kick message in a normal server in Roblox it would flash up a message saying that I have indeed been kicked so that's how to detect if a user has died in Roblox let me know if it was useful subscribe as always and I'll see you in the next one
