in this video I'm going to show you how to create an obstacle course on Roblox so the first thing you want to do is when you open up Roblox Studio the app which you need to create a Roblox game which will be linked in the description you need to click on the new button and select base plate once you've done that you'll see this screen we've got some panels here on the side one is the Explorer that allows us to see all of the objects in our game if you click on the Arrow where it says workspace you'll see we've got a base plate spawn location camera and terrain now if you don't see this panel the Explorer panel all you need to do is head to the top left corner of Roblox Studio go to view and make sure that Explorer and properties are selected and then down here in the bottom right we've got the properties window again these might be in a separate location but if you can see them on the screen that's all you need the properties window is where we can customize the appearance and behavior of any objects in the game which is going to be crucial for creating an Obby so let's get started by selecting the base plate and the spawn location we're going to right click and delete them for now now you'll see that this leaves us with nothing in the game world that's fine because what we can do is we can head up to the top of Roblox Studio select the Home tab and insert a part so if you just click on the part button you can see we have a new part which has been generated and this is going to be our lobby spawn area so let's use the four tools up here underneath the Home tab select move scale and rotate to manipulate this part so I'm going to select the scale tool this allows us to resize the part and you can see here that we've now got these handles on our part so we can drag and make our part bigger and then what I want to do is because this is going to be a platform that players stand on we want it to be stuck in the air we don't want it to fall and destroy itself when the game begins so let's head to the properties panel because I've just said the properties panel is what we use to control the appearance or in this case the behavior of our object we want to scroll down to where it says anchored you want to make sure anchored is selected make it checked this just means that when the game starts this part isn't going to fall out of the world next what we need to do is insert a spawn on top of this part so that players will be positioned in this lobby area so if we head back to our top area here on this menu bar and if we select the model tab this time and just move over here you can see it says spawn so this is underneath the model tab so if we click on spawn you can see a spawn has been added to the game and we can just drag this and place it on top of our lobby all right let's see what works so far let's head back to the tabs area here let's go to the Home tab and click on play now what should happen is our character should spawn on our spawn point there we go so we've created the lobby part for our Hobby now it's time to create some actual obstacles so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this part which is our lobby area I'm going to right click and I'm going to duplicate it okay you can also press Ctrl D on the keyboard but I've just made a duplicate of it and then I'm going to select the move tool up here because I want to move this part and then we're just going to drag the blue handle and I'm going to create a jump okay so this is a jump that a player is going to have to navigate now I'm going to use the scale tool up here and I'm just going to make this second part a little bit smaller okay so this is our jump we don't need to worry about the anchored property because it's still the same it's checked just like this other part because this is a duplicate so what we can now do is select the move tool again I'm going to go back and I'm going to press Ctrl D on the keyboard or command D if you're on a Mac to duplicate this jump okay I've pressed it and I'm just going to move it along here I'm going to create a few jumps this is going to be our first obstacle so you can just keep pressing the duplicate key or you can right click of course and select duplicate it's up to you I'm just going to keep on doing these for a few more jumps there we go so this is going to be our first obstacle now if you'd like you can change the color of these parts all you have to do is click on the select tool and then select the parts that you want to color and then once it's selected you see this blue box outline you then just want to head down to the properties panel and underneath brick color you can choose a color here and you can see in the corner that it's actually changing the color so I can do a red part and I can do the same for all these other ones as well so there we go I've just selected each individual part gone to the properties window down here and changed that brick color property you could also change the color property which lets you make them a little bit more detailed so it's up to you and again if you don't see the properties window or the Explorer panel do not worry all you need to do is just head up to the top left here click on view and make sure that these two are selected alright now that we've created our first obstacle I'm going to go back over here take our little platform right click duplicate it again and I'm going to use the move tool to just bring it over here so this is going to be a little rest area a little platform for our players to chill on before they take the next obstacle so let's create that next obstacle now there's going to be a choose path now you've probably seen these before it's going to be three different paths and only one of them is going to be the correct path the other two the player will fall through them if they choose that path so what I'll do is I'm going to select this part we're going to duplicate it so Ctrl D or command D and then using the move tool I'm just going to move it to the very edge here okay and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to select the scale tool because we want to change the size so using the scale tool I'm just going to make this about a third of the width of this platform here okay and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to right click duplicate select the move tool and bring it back over here okay and I'm going to do the exact same thing again right click duplicate and bring this over now just to make this in the middle of the two of the parts I'm just going to head to the model tab I'm going to uncheck this box where it says snap to grid underneath move so I'm going to uncheck move and this will just let us have some free movement it's not going to lock it to studs so I can finally set the position of this middle part now that we've got our three paths I said I only want one of them to be walkable so I'm going to select the other two paths so I want the part the path in the middle to be walkable okay now if we select this part you'll see in the properties window which controls the behavior of these parts that can Collide is set to true and this is going to be really important this part because if we just move over here so you can see it there we go so you can see this one in the middle the can Collide is set to true we want to keep that the same we want to keep this checked because can Collide means that you can walk over the parts if we were to set this can Collide property to unchecked it would mean that you'd fall straight through it when you try to walk over it so since I want this middle part to be the correct path I'm going to firstly select the other two okay so I've selected them both by holding down control or command on my keyboard I've just selected them I'm going to uncheck and Collide okay so now these two paths the one on the left and the one on the right the plan will fall straight through if they try to walk on them but of course the player doesn't know that they'll just have to try this obstacle a couple of times until they realize which path is the right one and just like before we can select each heart head to the properties window and change the brick color so I can set this one to be red this one can be green and this one can be yellow okay so now that we've done that we've created our first choose path we can do the same thing again we can just take these three blocks by using the select tool up here and we can just drag to select all four we've got three paths and one platform and then we can right click duplicate that's going to create a duplication of all four parts and then we can go back up here to use the move tool and since they're all still selected we can just move them over now I'm going to head back to the snap to grid and in the model tab here and just set that to be checked again because I want it to lock to one stood when I move it and then we can just drag our duplicate Parts over here and this time I want this uh far right part to be the correct path so I'm going to set that one's can Collide to be true down here okay and then the other two I'm going to select by holding down control or command and heading back to the properties window you can see it's got a subtract or a line through the box that means one of them's can collide one of them isn't at the moment so if I just check that if I click it sorry it's going to uncheck it so both these two the red and the green are now going to be the incorrect paths because we've set their can Collide to be false this one on the right is the correct one and I'm also going to change the colors of these because why not we can have a blue one we can have a pink one and we can have another yellow one okay and if you want you can do one more but I think two is enough just because it's going to take the player a few tries anyway to work this out so I'm going to go back and take one of my platforms over here right click duplicate I'm going to use the move tool and just bring this over here okay so there we go our second obstacle is completed let's have a quick playthrough of our hobby to make sure everything's working so I'm gonna head back up here to the Home tab and then just over here underneath the test section I'm going to click on play this is going to spawn us into the game you can see we're here at the spawn point let's give our jumps a go so are there just about five or six studs spaced out which is just enough for the player so that is a uh a tested fully tested obstacle we know that one works and then we've got our choose path so we've got the the path down the middle which is the correct one and we've got this one on the right as well which is the correct one but any other path oh oh there we go here we go yeah any other path that we that we try and walk through will just uh we'll just fall straight through and we'll die so all good it seems like the hobby is working so far let's now create our final obstacle now the final obstacle is going to be some lava jumps so I'm going to take this platform select it and then up here we're going to select the scale tool and I'm going to extend this platform to allow us to place our lava bricks on top of them now we need to insert another part so let's head back up here and choose part that's going to spawn this part on top of our platform so we can just take it move it to the edge and make it span the entire width of this platform then we can go down to the properties window and where it says brick color we can set that to Red I'm also going to set the material to be neon if you have a look you can see I've now got a bright shiny red lava Block in fact I'm going to make this a little bit harder and extend the width and height of this lava jump alright now I'm just going to go back and select the move tool and I'm just going to space this out a little bit so the player's got some room and then I'm going to keep right clicking and duplicating to place down some more lava bricks all right so here are all my lava bricks but there's one last thing we need to do we need to make the player die when they step on these lava jumps so how do we do that well it's rather easy all we need to do is Select them all so I'll select one two three four holding down control or command if you're on a Mac so they're all selected and then in the Explorer panel I'm going to right click and select group as a folder then in the properties window I can name this folder lava bricks and then all we now need to do is back in the Explorer if we go to server script service we'll click on this plus and search for a script now make sure you insert this gray script here and then you'll see the code editor has opened up I'm just going to hide this Banner here and even if you've not written any code before don't worry we're just going to write some simple code which will make the player die when they step on a lava brick so here's the code you need to write so here is the code firstly you don't have to write out these green comments they're just there to help explain what's going on so firstly we create a variable to easily reference our folder over here in the workspace we then Loop through every single lava brick in that folder and for each one we detect when the lava brick has been stepped on which gives us the object that touched the brick now it could be a player it could be some other object in the game so we have to make sure that it is a player by doing a check here which will return true or false and if it is a potential player then we're going to set the health of that player's humanoid which is in their character to zero which is going to kill them now there'll be a link to this code in the description alternatively you can just pause the video and copy it out for yourself but make sure that you spell everything correctly just like I have here because a simple typo can cause your script to break now for this to work you'll have to make sure that all of your parts are in a folder called lava bricks with a space in between the lava and bricks and obviously a capital l and capital B for lava and Bricks but once you've done that your lava bricks should be good to go now let's see if they work I'm going to click on play here up here underneath the Home tab that will teleport you to the exact location where you want to spawn so if you click on that little arrow underneath play here and select play here because you may be set to play rather than play here it will spawn you wherever your character what your camera is facing so if you just move your camera over here you will spawn at the lava bricks and now if we step on our lava bricks you can see it kills us so we've got our three obstacles here and it takes us back to the start when you finish now you may be wondering how to add checkpoints and I actually made another video showing how to do this and I'll be creating an updated version in the meantime as well so I'll leave a link to that for you to go and watch but that's it for this video you've just learned how to make a very simple Hobby in Roblox studio in just
