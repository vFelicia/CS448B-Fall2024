hey guys Arvin blocks here in this video going to be reviewing the top of plugins that I use on a daily basis in roblox to do very very useful plugins are we leaving a link to all of them in the description but let's get started with the first plugin which is row tasks and row tasks is created by avoided blade what it allows you to do is have notes in your scripts which then appear in this window so you can jump to certain areas in your script let me give you a quick example so let's just say we have a scripts what I can do is do a normal comment but then if I do two arrows like this and then a comma and sorry not a comment a colon after that I can write a message and I could say this part is for the intermission and then later on I could say something else so just describing what this part of the script does etc and when you have code in between here you can your scripts can be really long so you might forget where a certain part is so what it allows you to do is when you're out of the scripts and you want to quickly jump to a certain piece of your code you can just click it and it will take you to that line if I was to put a load of spaces so let's imagine that they're they're quite far apart it will jump to the intermission or if I click down here to go to the game loop it's gonna take me straight there so a great plugin if you have lots of code and lots of scripts and you keep forgetting where certain parts of your code are located and you just need to quickly go to them to change something or or fix a book so really useful next plugin is the tool grip edit or by clone trooper 1019 now you may have come across this problem before where you're creating a tool and then it doesn't fit on the character correctly so the tool grip editor lets you change this so when you click it it will say select a tool edit tool grip what it will do is it will place a player's arm on the tool and you can move this little green ball and that will move the the players arm relative to the gun so you can see in the window that the actual grip of the tool is changing so if I wanted to I actually changed the rotation of the tool I could do that so it could be pointing in your face and then what I'm doing I just need to UM click away deselect the tool and the changes have been applied you can see it's pointed in our faces just like we just positioned it with the tool grip editor so there you go great plugin if you're designing tools or weapons and you just can't make it fit on the characters aren't correctly okay next plugin is the data store editor now this one is a lifesaver you may not be using data stores yourself but when you do it's very very useful so if somebody says that they lost data or their save slot got corrupted or you just want to be kind and give them some money in your game you can edit their data store without having to write any code let me give you an example of how this works so I'm here in one of my friends games and I'm going to access his data store by typing in the name of the data store so this is the name that you give when you call get data store on a datastore service so I'm just going to put mine in here and I don't need to bother with the scope I'm going to click on connect and now I've connected to that places data store system I now need to put in a player's key so each player in a data store will have their own key which uniquely identifies their data store so I can put that in and I'm going to change their money now I'm going to set this to 1077 okay I'm gonna click Save and when that is saved I can just disconnect or I can click this button and the the players data store will have been changed and you can now see that when I joined the game I have 1077 money because it was my data store that I edited so great plugin if you need to change somebody's data store or even if you try to debug your data stores if it's not saving correctly you want to check the format etc really useful plugin ok next plugin and this one is a very simple one it's called load character I've got the pro version but I think there's also a lite version that's free when you use it all you need to do is type in somebody's username I can put in my own and then I can click whether you want the are six version or the are 15 version or how the the player has he set their body to be and when you click one of those it will insert that player's character so great if you want to have some friends in your game or you just want to insert a character to play with or test with next one that I'm going to show you is get object path so this is really useful if you're in a script and you want to access an object that's nested within a load of objects and you're too lazy like me to actually get the path of the object so instead of having to say game door workspace the album block start left low arm got left wrist rig attachment that's a lot of typing so all you need to do is open up the output window and then just go to the plugin and there it is get object path boom it will get the path of the selected item in the Explorer and it will put it in the output so all you need to do is just copy it and put it into a script it should work fine just saying workspace don't you say game dat workspace and because that is a shortcut right next plugin that we're going to look at is UI design by style rack now this is a brilliant plugin if you're making GUI is now you may remember round if I it's a plugin that I've featured before on the channel but this is a great way of helping you make UI user interface if you're not very good at all that stuff so let me show you if I have a UI element you've got the round the fire feature which lets you make a frame around it with rounded edges like this so I use it quite a lot in UI design we've also got the drop shadow effect what that lets you do is apply a nice little shadow to the GUI I'm going to show you click create shadow boom you can also edit that so if you don't want the shadow to be as thick you can just change the offset here loads of things that you can change you can also change the color so it could have a green drop shadow so really really nice we've also gotten this is probably the best feature of it positioning tools so you can just quickly position something in the top left corner top right corner wherever you want any corner just click the corner you want and click position boom you can have down here have it in the middle and you can see it it stays in the middle even if you changed the screen size so that's brilliant because it uses scale we've also got a class converter so you could change it to a different element or UI type so if you wanted to change this to be an image label you can just click it click convert and boom is changed you can make a scrolling frame boom changed or a text button and it's gonna keep the original properties it's gonna make it's gonna retain its position its size etc so all around great plugin you've also got a create UI as well so you can insert a frame inside a frame just a quick way of having to go into objects and search for the thing you want to insert so very very very cool well done Starex and I do recommend you go download this one next plugin is a little bit similar to the one we've just looked at by stellar X in regards to the class converter but this is called reclass by Altaf it's a really good class converter and you can use it on other things such as scripts so you can click convert and it will say you need to enable HTTP requests so you need to go over here get em settings options HTTP requests save then you need to go to convert and you can see you can change it to our local scripts boom is changed or a modular script so it's gonna give you objects that you can change this one to and it's going to keep the same properties so let me give you an example if I insert a part if I wanted to then change it to a spawn location I'd have to create the part all over again but I can just click boom change it to a spawn location witch house has changed the class name so this is now actually a spawn location but it's kept the color it's kept the material the size position everything has been kept the same but it has changed its class so really really good plugin but what I love about the plugin is that you can automatically change it so if you don't want to bother with going to this converts tab because we're all lazy and we don't want to do that what's gonna do is it's going to decide the best class to change it to it's gonna it's going to try and determine what you're gonna use it for so this is a remote event it can either be a remote event or remote function so I click automatic and boom it changes it to a remote function and again it changed it to a bindable function sorry there are four types remote event remote function bindable event bundle function it's going to change it to what it thinks is best for you so going to try and guess so if I click automatic it's gonna change to a script because we're in service Crypt service so really really could plug in really do like this one well done I'll talk on creating that we've also got another plugin by L table and that is mg and what mg allows you to do is if you have a decal ID and some of you may know the struggle here when you upload a decal to roblox sometimes the ID won't work and you have to do that thing where you have to subtract 1 from the ID and you have to keep going back and back and back until you find the correct imager ID this is just a really simple way it does it for you so if you were to go and find a decal and I've copied one from the roblox website if I just paste it in there well it's done it's got me the image ID it's also given me the short RBX asset ID version and it's also given me the long URL as well all I need to do is just paste this into the image and it's given me the ID which is really really great and this is useful when you're scripting and you want to change the ID of an image button or an image label or a decal object from a script you would need to write this out it just gives you a really quick URL for you to copy and paste so greatlooking there I use that I don't use it that often but it does come in handy sometimes so it's a good one to have now let's see what else have we got here this is a good plugin this is the welding plugin by Ossie pig because welding can be a bit confusing if you're new to roblox and it can just take a while even for for me even it's what I would want to weld a couple of things together now what if I didn't want to anchor these parts because I want them to fall to the ground I want them I want to be able to play with them with the physics but I want them to all be stuck together like like Lego blocks you see that they're welded together so what this plugin does is it lets you create those welds so I can go into the world editor here this is quite confusing I don't use this very much but you can do weld all and that's going to create a weld and it's going to basically put all these parts weld them together so that they're stuck together but they are not anchored so great plugin and I do recommend it next plugin that we're going to look at is the instance tagging by I think it's sweet dark taupe and that is a hard use name to pronounce but the the link will be in the description what it does and I've done a video on collection service before so I'm not gonna go over it too much it lets you add tags to object so I could say I could give it a tag called important script and if I had lots of scripts in the game like a tag certain wonders being an important script or an important part and what you can then do is when you've tagged all of your object that you want to have that tag you can access them all via a script so that's what collection service is about and the tag editor just lets you apply those tags to them so really really good plugin that the next plugin is easy crop by owner walk this is a great plugin again for user interface so what this plugin allows you to do is if we head into the image button click crop you can see it brings you up a nice little editing window so you can select a certain part of the image the Europe that you want to show so you may just want to crop this decal down or this this image and all I need to do is select so I'm going to crop it as a button or a label so if I want it to be a button it's going to insert it as an image label but if I want it to be an image button its gonna insert that image button for me you can also flip it so you can reverse the image on the X or yaxis and can change the size as well so if you want it to be 10 by 10 boom just insert it there and it's gonna it's gonna insert that for you so really really great look in there from on a go and I do love it image size I pretty sure it's the size of the crop window so you can see if I set it here there's kind of like a bit of snapping but if I was to change the resolution here to something huge you see it's it's much more and smoother so there we go great little plugin there and very useful for the UI designers out there that we're gonna look at today is minify so if you have a script that is really unordered so let's give you an example here like this and it's just not organized it's not tabbed it's not you know it's not very good what you can do is you can just and click minify and down here this little UI will appear and it says do you want to be you defy or minify and you want to keep it pretty or make the script small or as small as it can be just to save data and make it a little bit more efficient but it's not going to be efficient that you can notice the optimization so I don't recommend doing that I'm gonna do keep Global's and just do folding now if we preview this look how it's changed the script so it was that before but it's now made it look beautiful like this so create and what it does is it just updates the script it puts a beautified version in there so you can get rid of this original script and use the beautified version but I recommend that you do keep the old script just in case something goes wrong and you need to get the old one back so great little plugin there so we've got one that I've just enabled here because I've got too many plugins on the on the screen here is insert asset and this is by Z Kevin now all you need to do is paste an asset ID for an item from the catalogue in here click confirm and it's going to add it into the game and that way you can just instead of having to look for it in three models whatever you've got the added in the game which is really really awesome and one last plugin I'm going to show you is called words of encouragement now it's a cool little plugin it's currently disabled for me to enable it though if you have disabled it you can go right click on a window and click on words of encouragement so what this will do is it will insert a player from your friends list with a motivational message so this person here lene 2009 saying be proud of your work then actually saying that but it's been generated by the plugin so pretty cool it updates every couple of minutes and it's a nice little thing to to look at and every time every five minutes a new one comes up so it doesn't really help you in any way but it's a nice cool plugin that's been trending recently and I like it so and every time you're going to play solo to test your game a new person will appear as well with a new message so that's pretty cool there we go so shout out to to those guys so there we go they are all the plugins that I use on a regular basis let me know if you want to see more of these in the future because I do use more plugins on my other computers as well and because I don't use this one all the time and development so I do have more plugins to possibly show you in the future so let me know if you do like this type of video and give it a thumbs up let me know that you liked it don't forget to subscribe if you're new over here for more roblox scripting videos and I'll see you in the next one Cheers bye
