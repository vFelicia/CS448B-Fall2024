hey everyone welcome to episode number 15 this is Alvin blocks first of all sorry for the lack of uploads recently especially in this series I am very sorry about that although I have been working on my own roblox game which is coming soon hence the lack of uploads but also some other projects for the channel which are taking up my time so you should be able to see those soon today though we're looking at while loops so lots of different while loops in roblox scripting this one the while loop is probably the easiest one that we're going to be looking at so let's begin a while loop is code block code element you could say and what it will do is any code that you put inside of a while loop will repeat over and over again forever basically and you can see here we've said while true do and then we've got an end here so in between these two red lines this is our while loop okay so the wild true do is the syntax that we need to tell the script it's a while loop and any code that goes in between these two lines will repeat forever now I just need to tell you this before we go any further because a while loop will run forever continuously what happens is it loops over and over again really quickly and when it does this it starts to lag your PC if you don't have a delay in between loops so if we didn't have a delay here like we have this wait what would happen is it would constantly loop thousands and thousands and thousands of times on your computer and it executes super fast so we won't even be able to see it happening because it will be happened so fast they crash your script if I'll just show you here if I run the game you can see it's starting to lag a bit you can see it's stuck here and that's because it is just doing these while loops over and over again with no delays and there we go it's had to timeout because the script has been overwhelmed with requests so the first thing you need to know is that when you have a while loop you have to have some kind of wait some kind of delay it doesn't have to be long the fault wait if you don't put a number in there he's naught point naught three seconds so that's a decent wait time but as long as you just have a wait in there just so that the script can pause each time it loops because if you do a while lube it's gonna keep going and if you don't have a wait it's gonna try and just do loads of ruining lots of code at once so that's not good you have to have a delay so what we saw there if we just run it again is that it just keeps on printing over and over again now you can see here it's only printed it once in the output but we've got this X 260 and it keeps going up every naught point naught 3 seconds and that's just a way of not spamming your output and it's telling us that it is printing 500 times that's what's gone up see now but it's just showing it once in the output because it's printing the same message over and over again so you can see that the script is repeating the code so it's just gone to this line okay we're going to the wait line next it gets to the end everywhere in a while loop so it goes back to the start and then it goes back to the print then it waits and it goes back to the start and it prints and it waits the thing goes back to the start so that weight is waiting or no point not three seconds now you can change this weight whatever you want and the scripts going to delay so it's gonna print this is awesome it's gonna wait one second and it's gonna print it again let's have a look so it's printed this is awesome you see it's at times two now so times 3 9 times 4 times 5 times 6 times 7 etc so it's it's looping every one second because we've got this weight in there but we need a weight to prevent it from crushing the script now a while true do loop will run no matter what so no matter what happens this wire loop is going to run so if I have a weight 5 at the start of the script so I'm going to do anything until after 5 seconds so 3 or 5 there we go so and now it started it's entered that while loop so what's happened is the Scriptures started we're not in the wild loop yet because we're on line 2 but after those 5 seconds we're entering the while loop so we're no longer going to if we had some extra code down here we're no longer going to worry about that okay we're not going to get to that because we're stuck in this wild loop and this wild loop it's gonna is gonna move on to this line gonna move on to this line and then it's gonna repeat all over again and we're gonna just get stuck in this loop and it's gonna keep going over and over and over again and we're never gonna get to the code that's down here so why do we use a while loop some people will ask so it's kind of helpful if you have like a game script where you have a game that repeats over and over again for example so you could have your intermission and then the actual game and then the end of round stuff where everyone gets teleported that's Lobby and then it's gonna repeat over again right the game is a new games gonna happen so it's going to go back to the start it's gonna do the intermission it's gonna do the game it's gonna do the end of round stuff boom new game so it just is like a game loop so you can put your all of your you'll go your K your codes sorry your games code if I'm get get my words out all of your games code inside the while loop and then it will just repeat it over and over again and of course you're gonna have your weights in there for things like the intermission things like the game loop but that's getting more advanced but you can see the idea of wire loops so it's looping over and over again now for the while loop to repeat over and over again every time it loops it checks this true so this is basically the condition okay so the thing in the middle here it's called the condition now it can either be true or it can be false so when the condition is false the while loop is not going to run but when the condition is true the while loop will run so if you just want the while loop to run and repeat no matter what then you can just leave as true and it's gonna keep on looping no matter what but if you want the while loop to only run when a certain condition is met just like an if statement so we could have a variable okay so that's false but I could say while my var is equal to truth then I want the while loop to run so what will happen is this we will never enter this wallet because my VAR is never ever true so if I was to do have print down here saying we've reached line 10 here if I was to do this and we run you can see it will say we have reached line 10 after five seconds because I put that wait at the start so what's happened is we've set my variable to false we've waited five seconds we've got to line five and we've said okay while my var is equal to true but my var is equal false so this condition is false because it's not been met my var is not equal to true so this condition this statement is false just like an if statement so an if statement will only run if the condition is true just like a while loop will never run if the condition is false so even though we have got a true here actually this condition my var isn't true so the entire condition that the conditions value is false and we know when a while loop the condition the thing in the middle the outcome is false it's not going to run but when it's true it is gonna run so he just tries again set it to true what should happen is after five seconds we're gonna enter this while loop and this while loop is gonna loop forever and everyone ever it's gonna just print this is awesome every one second and we're never ever gonna reach line ten so let's check out so just wait five seconds three four five there we go so prints this is awesome this is awesome and it's never ever gonna print that we've reached line ten I could pause the video and come back in 24 hours and we still would not have reached line ten it will never ever reach line ten because we're stuck in this while loop here we're just stuck in it and we're never ever gonna gonna move on to the rest of the code because when it goes to the end it just restarts and that's the whole point of a while loop it runs forever now of course you could change the condition the condition could change whilst it's running so every time you get to the end it's gonna check this condition again so after the first and pass on the while loop I could set my false and then what's gonna happen is it's gonna go to the end it's gonna restart it's gonna say ok it's my VAR still true and there is NOx we just changed it to false so it's gonna it's gonna basically stop the while loop and it's gonna move on to the next piece of code so the while loop will only stop when the condition changes so again let's just open the script again but we've got a game running so it says this is awesome once and then it says we've reached line 10 because it printed it waited one second we then set my var to false so when it looped around again and we got back up to the top here it said okay so is my var still equal to true because that's our condition and it's gonna check it every time that the loop comes round again so my var okay we set it to true up here but we've since edited it we've changed its value because that's a variable and variable means to be able to change the variable has bit has changed to false so my var is no longer equal to true so the while loop has stops and it has moved on to the next piece of code we've reached line ten so in the other example it never ever got to this line it never printed we've reached line ten because we never changed my var so there we go while loop it will run forever as long as the condition is true so in this case the condition was always true but in the previous case here it was only true on the first go around because we changed my bar you may be wondering well what's the point in the condition I'll give you some examples you can check the number of players in your game so you could do while you don't need to know this but game DUP players get players and be just about hashtag here this condition what it will do is it will give us a number of players in the game so it could be three players so if I say it while the number of players is greater or let's even say less than two we could print not enough players in the game and we'll just remove this here because we don't need it anymore and we can print here enough players reached let's carry on so here what I've done is I've created a while loop that it's not going to carry on it's not going to continue running the rest of the script until we have enough players in the game so what it's doing is it's checking okay it's the number of players in the game less than two mmm yes it is so we're gonna print not enough players in the game we're gonna wait one second and we're gonna say okay we'll check again and if the number of players does rise to two or two or more let's say we will break out of this wire loop and we will carry on with the script so if we have some more code down here maybe to teleport players or whatever that code would only run when enough players are in the game so there you go nice practical example of how a while loop will work and we can actually test that right now if we head into play solo you can see that it says not enough plays in the game because there's only one person in the game but if somebody else joined then it would stop that wire loop because they would then be two players in the game so there we go a nice little brief introduction into while loops I hope that was useful so if you enjoyed it please do smash the like button on the video let me know that you're enjoying it and you want more and don't forget to share it with a friend who may want to learn about this get some more knowledge on wild loops so they're really important and that's all you need to know right now about what are loops so thanks for watching again sorry about the lack of videos recently but I do appreciate the support and I'll see you in the neck video Cheers
