hello everyone and welcome back to another video this is episode number 12 in my scripting series I hope you guys had a great new year I'm gonna try and upload as many videos as I can this year so apologies for the recent delay in videos however it should be back on track now so in today's video we are looking at embedded if statements and also else if so I'm just gonna kick it off and tell you guys about embedded if statements so we have an if statement here and what this sir if statement does is it checks to see if a number is odd or even so what we're using is using the modulus function here and what modulus does is it divides these two numbers together and then it returns the remainder so the selected condition that I have there's in blue right now is what what is going to return is the remainder of this division so we've got my number set to 5 so if you were to do 5 divided by 2 obviously that's 2.5 so that would be 2 remainder 1 because 2 times 2 is 4 and there's one left over so because 2.5 is a decimal then there would be a remainder of 1 here so it would be 2 remainder 1 so in this case 5 would not be even it would be odd so modulus is a great way to just check if a number is even or odd or a multiple of another number because it will return a remainder and if the remainder is zero then you'll know that it's it's gone into the number cleanly and there's no remainder but if there is a remainder then it's not going to be equal to zero so you don't understand it too much don't worry yet but basically what those condition does is it decides whether the number is even or not because if the remainder 0 we know it's even and if it's not then we know it's odd so just to show you if I was to run this scripts check the output it says that it's odd if I was to put an even number in here such as 6 and I run the code again it would say that it's even so there we go we have a quick condition here just check to see if a number is even or odd so if an embedded if statement is an if statement inside of another if statement so if we were to put another if statement in here we can just do something else a if my number plus would okay if I have to say if my number plus one is even then prints we can just print my number plus one is even so what's happening here is if my number here so six is it is an even number then we print it is even and then we're running another if statement I'm adding one to my number so imagine it's now seven and we can check if that's even as well and if it is we can do another print so let's find out so it's just printed that it is even so obviously this condition must be false because my number add one which is 7 obviously 7 is not an even number so let's do an else and let's say else prints my number at one it's odd and run again and it should say that my number add one is odd let's just replace that my number plus 1/2 my number plus one like this and we'll do a two string here as well okay don't worry about this 2 string by the way that's just making it so that we can print out the number because you have to make it a string as a string is what you print out and you can't go printing out numbers with strings so you have to convert it to a to a string so there we go it's printed that is even and then it's printed out the my number with one handed on which is 7 to say is odd so you can see we've got an if statement inside of this if statement but if we were to have an odd an odd number here and we do our first condition so our first condition checks to see if my number which is 5 is is divisible by 2 with no remainder so whether my number even or not so obviously five is an odd number so it's immediately gonna skip to our elfs statement and print out that it's odd so because it's gone to the elf's statement it's not been able to check our if statement here because it's nested it's embedded inside of our if statement here because anything that's in between this if and this else will only run if the condition here is true if it's not true then it's only going to print what's in the else statement down here so what we could do is we could move we could do another if statement down here and that would run if the else statement if the else runs and it will run regardless of whether it's true or not because we've got it up here and down here as well so I'm just showing you that you can have an if statement inside of another if statement that's fine as long as you you have your end to close it off as well so you can do as many if statements inside of each other as you like but each time you do an if statement then just make sure that you're indenting it each time so that your code is nice and clean and easy to read okay so that's all you need to know about embedded if statements now we're just gonna look at else if so else if it's similar to having an an embedded if statement although it just saves you having to keep indenting and writing out the ends as well those ends to close off those if statements so all you need to do instead of writing else you can just say else if like this and then you just write out your second condition so if my number let's just say let's just say if it's a multiple of three this time okay instead of it being a multiple of two let's check if it's a multiple of three so we can say instead of this being odd say it's a multiple of three so you can see if the first condition is not met if it's not true then it will get to our else or elseif and it will check our second condition to see if it's a multiple of three and if it isn't a multiple of three you can keep on doing this outfit if you can see we're not having to write that end at the end we can just say let's just do another one for multiple of five you can see we've got what two more if statements but we've only got one end and that's because it's a part of the same this big if statement is the same if statement it's just that we've got multiple conditions in case that the first one or the second one or the third one doesn't work and if they all are false if they all aren't true we can say just one normal house I'm can print they all did not run so we could put another number in here such as two as our as our number and it would print out it's even because it's met the first condition or we could set it to five and it would go to the third condition here would go to the third if here in this else if because it's not a more school of two it's not a multiple of three with some multiple of five so it's going to skip down to our third statement and it's going to print out it's a morsel of five but if it is not a morsel of any of those numbers it will just skip to our else and say that they all did not run so else if allows you to have multiple conditions in one if statement in case one of them doesn't work and you want to check something else but remember that you will only get to check these else ifs if the first condition isn't true so let's imagine that number is multiple of three so if it is a multiple of three that's great it's going to run this line here but then it's not going to run anymore else ifs or else's because the the if statement has now been met right the condition has been met so it's enough to do it anymore else's and it will just print they will just go onto the next line of code so let's example say finished down here it will say it's a multiple of three yep and then it will just skip all of these else ifs here and it will just go to the end of the script we'll say finished so if you do want to do your else ifs and you want certain ones to to certain ones to run in order make sure that you've got them ordered so you might want to check whether it's a multiple of five before it's a multiple of three for example but doesn't really matter these will only run if your conditions that you have previously written are false so there you are that's what else if is it allows you to have multiple you know conditions and checks in one if statement there we go although I guess you could say it's it's more than one if statement because you've got ifs here but what what I mean is they're only going to run if the first if doesn't doesn't work if it's false you see but there you go that is else if and also how you use embedded if statements I will be publishing more videos in the future
