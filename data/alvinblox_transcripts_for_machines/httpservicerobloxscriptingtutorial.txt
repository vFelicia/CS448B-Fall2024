how to use HTTP service to make requests to external web servers from a Roblox game so firstly you have to insert a script into server script service or anywhere on the server because you can only use HTTP service on the server this is to prevent exploiters from having a field day sending requests from Roblox next you need to turn on the HTTP service so we'll go to game settings permissions sorry security and enable h HTTP requests then click on Save okay now in our script let's get the HTTP service by saying this okay and then let's create a variable for our URL okay so the the URL of the web server that we're going to request so let's just get a URL I'm going to use this URL which is row proxy uh it's a way of reaching the Roblox apis uh because you can't use the Roblox apis on your own you have to use a proxy server and what this will do is it will return a bunch of information about my Roblox user and I'll see if I can get it on the screen okay here is the data that you get from going to this URL so by using HTTP service we can pull all of this data into our game and then use it however we like so I'm just going to keep that down in the corner corner so that we can uh we can see it as we're making the request and what we're going to do in order to get that data into our script we need to make a call so we'll say HTTP Service uh colon get async and then we'll put the URL in and then we will store this as a variable so we'll just put this as HTTP response for now and what we then need to do is we need to decode it okay because it's it's currently in Json for all right JavaScript object notation we want to decode that so we can access it like a normal table in L so we will say local decoded equals HTTP service colon Json decode and we'll put HTTP response in there and then we can print out the decoded table now this is assuming it exists so let's just say if HTTP response then and we'll put this in here just in case and then it should all be good so let's click on run see what happens okay so we've got a table returned here and if we look at this table you can see it's exactly the same as what we've got down here in the corner so we've got created description display name has verified badge ID is Ban name all right so there you go that's a very simple request you can then pull out any of this data from this table say I wanted to get whether I'm banned on Roblox or not you could say decoded do is band and then print is um and we can get my name as well is decoded dot uh name band and we can say is band and we'll just make that a string so that it doesn't cause an error and we'll run this again and you see no I'm not banned so that is how you can use HTTP service to make requests now what is this usually used for well you see a lot of Roblox games these days that have uh code verification so it will check to make sure you're a user of their group or whether you follow them on social media or whether you're a member of their server or not uh and also lots of games now use HTTP service to log uh things about their game so log when users join uh use they sometimes use it for band systems for external data storage it's really useful to know um because you can do lots of fun things such as this um but also you can do other things you can also send requests to servers I've just shown you how to get data from a URL um such as roxy.com but there's so many more apis out there um which you should check out which will let you pull in all sorts of data for your game you know for example you could pull in the amount of likes that your Roblox game has got to create a like goal or you could uh um you know you could pull in details about when the next live event is going to be so that is how you do HTTP Service uh requests let me know if you enjoyed it let me know if you have any more video ideas um subscribe to the channel if you want to see more of them and I'll see you in the next one
