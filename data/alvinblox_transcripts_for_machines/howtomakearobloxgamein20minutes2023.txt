in this video I'm showing you how to make a roblox game fast we're gonna be creating an obstacle style game which you can create with roblox to do publish for free and play with your friends let's get started welcome to my channel my name is Alvin blocks and I am all about how can you learn to make awesome games and on robux on roblox so make sure to subscribe if you're interested as I have a lots more videos like this well today we're gonna be learning how to create an obstacle course in under 20 minutes so let's get started so first thing that you're gonna need to do is install roblox studio now to do that there will be a link in the description you need to go to roblox cocom slash create once you're there click on the start creating button and that's going to check if you have roblox studio installed now if you do it should automatically start but if not it will walk you through the process of getting it installed now once you have roblox studio opened we're gonna select the baseplate template this is all we're gonna need to create our obstacle course from scratch now I'm gonna give you a quick overview of roblox studio and how you can use it so roblox studio is a powerful tool which you use to create roblox games every game on the platform uses it and it's got loads of features which allow you to build and code so we're gonna need to open up a few panels and I'm gonna give you a quick guide of them before we start these panels are going to be the Explorer window which is over here the properties window and the toolbox now if you don't see any of these windows to open up the toolbox click on home and blend you will see the button here to open it and close it and also the same goes for the Explorer window and the properties window you can open and close them by going to the View tab and then clicking on Explorer and properties so what do we use these for so the Explorer is used to show everything that's in your game world so if we open up the workspace here you can see we have a base plate and we can use the properties tab down here to change what it looks like and how it acts when the game is running so for example its color the tool box over here is used to insert a models created by other people so for example we could drag in a tree like this and there's loads of different models which you can use when it creates your own game but today we're gonna be creating our obstacle course completely from scratch with parts we're gonna be using the part tool and the four main tools to edit apart select move scale and rotate so let's get started with our obstacle course I'm going to select this baseplate in the in the game here now when I select it I'm going to set the color back to grey like this for now now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna scroll down to where it says size and I'm going to set it to 20 studs by two studs by 20 studs this just means that the size of the base plate will be 20 studs you see one stood here 20 on this axis 20 on this axis but it's only going to be two studs high like this so this is gonna be our spawn area where our players are going to get teleported to when they join or if they reset so I'm gonna change this now to be C green okay you can color it whatever you want and I'm also going to click on surface down here in the properties window and I'm going to set top surface to smooth once you've done that I'm gonna give it a name I'm just gonna call it base and set a base plate and I'm going to click on it and I'm going to right click and duplicate this is gonna create a clone of the pot so now we can just drag it and you can see we have two one on top of the other now I'm gonna resize this part by using the scale tool so click scale and then drag the red circle to make it two studs then I'm gonna use the Move tool to drag it away and create a border on the outside of this base part then I can change the brick color to black now all I have to do is duplicate again by pressing ctrl D or command D and then just move it along to the other side like this we can do the same thing again duplicate it and this time we're gonna need to rotate it for this side of the pot so you can either use the rotate tool like this or you can press ctrl R and that will rotate it 90 degrees now we can move it to the side of the face and drag it down and we're just gonna resize it so that now we start to see this black border on the side of our part so let's duplicate it again by pressing ctrl D or command D and we're going to use the Move tool to move it over to the other side just like that there we go we've created our spawn area let's select these parts here these border parts you can't select them in the game you have to select them in the Explorer that's because they're locked so you don't have to have them locks I'm going to turn locks off for now and you can see now that we've unchecked the locks property we can select them so select the borders and the base and make sure that anchored is set to true anchored basically means whether the part is gonna stay in the air or whether it's gonna fall to the ground now we want this to be stuck in a fixed position so we're gonna keep anchored set to true now that we've done that we're gonna need to create a spawn part which is where our player is going to be teleported to when they join the game so click on the module tab and click on spawn let's drag it down onto our base and I'm gonna use the scale tool to make it a little bit smaller I'm gonna click on the green circle I'm gonna hold down shift and this will just make sure that when we resize it it keeps the ratio for each axis but I'm gonna click on the model first and where it says move I'm just gonna turn this off okay this allows us to have no snapping we can move it with no increment so we can move it wherever you want and now I hold down shift and I scale down in the spawn part and now we can just drag it on to our spawn area and I'm gonna delete this decal this image on top of the spawn just by clicking on top I'm gonna click on delete there we go we've just created our spawn area now let's create our first obstacle some rainbow jumps let's insert a part I'm gonna turn snap to grid back on and I'm gonna set it to one stood and with this part I'm just gonna drag it so it goes against this black border I'm gonna scale it down so it's the same depth and I'm gonna scale it across like this next I'm just gonna move it away from the border I'm gonna make sure that it's anchored so it doesn't fall out of the sky and we're gonna use the scale tool to make it a little bit bigger like that okay I'm gonna give it a color let's do red for now and then I'm going to select it and I'm gonna duplicate it again I'm gonna right click and press duplicate or ctrl D and I'm gonna move it across with the move tool now if you want to quickly access these tools select move scale and rotate you can press down control or command if you're on a Mac and press either 1 2 3 or 4 for each tool 3 is for scale 2 is for move one is for selects and 4 is for a rotation so I'm going to move this part along and I'm gonna duplicate again and just keep making these jumps which go higher and higher a bit like a staircase now once you've got enough you can start but I'm just going to take three more and duplicate them all at once by selecting them and also I'm just going to make sure they all look good like that okay so now I've got my jumps we can start curling them differently so I'm gonna use this color tool up here we're gonna click on this arrow I'm gonna make sure that color action is tool is selected that allows us to paint a loads of bricks at once so selects a color and then make sure that you selected the color tool and then you'll see this paint bucket this allows us to quickly select a color so I'm gonna select green light blue dark blue and we'll have a pink and we'll finish off with a purple just like this so there we go we have just created our own rainbow jumps so we're gonna select all of these parts by dragging click holding down the left mouse button and dragging so they're selected and we're going to ctrl + G or command G alternatively right click and click on group this is gonna put them all in the model so that we can move them all around at once and that we can organize all of our parts in the game I'm gonna give this model a name of jumps there we go next what we're going to need to do is clone this spawn area and turn it into a checkpoint which we can put over here but first let's group together all of the parts which are in our spawn as well so we're gonna select them we're going to then group them and I'm going to call this checkpoint so now we've got two models one for our spawn area and one for our rainbow jumps I'm gonna go and clone this checkpoint I'm going to duplicate it so rightclick duplicate and there we go we have now got another spawn point or a checkpoint now because we don't want our players to spawn at the second level we want them to spawn back at the start we're gonna remove this spawn point for now we only want the spawn points to be at the start in a future video we will add checkpoints so that you don't have to go back to the start every time that you die but now that we've got our second check in here what we can do is create our second obstacle let's create some lava jams so lava jumps are bricks which the player will have to jump over and if they touch the lava brick they will die and go back to the start so I'm gonna select the white color and I'm going to click on paths this is gonna insert another part for us and we can just drag it over here so it's touching the checkpoint now because they're gonna have to jump over the lava jumps we're gonna want to have a base so this is gonna be our base where we're gonna put the lava jumps on top of I'm using the scale tool to make it a little bit bigger and so there's enough room for us to put all of our jumps on so let's make sure it's anchored and it doesn't fall out of the sky and I'm going to change the name to base now we just need to insert another part and this will be our lava jump so make sure it's scale was the entirety of the base and that it's high enough so that people have a challenge when jumping over it I'm gonna make it a little bit shorter like that there we go and I'm gonna move it along here but because it's lava we want it to be shiny and red so let's change the brick color property to a nice red color I'm gonna change the material to neon this will make it stand out and it looks as if it's lit up so now that we've got our lava brick we to make it kill the player make sure it's anchored so it doesn't fall out the sky or it doesn't start moving around if someone touches it and let's name it the lava so how do we make it clear the player well we need to do scripting scripting allows you to bring your parts to life it allows things to happen when you don't have to control them it allows you to tell the game what to do and it will do it for you so make sure that you rightclick cover over into object and click scripts once you've got your script in the game we can start by writing some simple code now we're gonna need to do a touched event which detects when someone touches the brick so we can say script up parent which is the part of the larva brick because the script parent is this lava here doctor that's the name of the event in which we're waiting to see waiting to see if something touches it curl on connect and then we say function and I'm gonna do a pair of parenthesis and drop a line like this and roblox should add this end with a closing bracket on it now inside of this bracket we're going to a parameter now a parameter is some data that gets passed to this scripts whenever something happens so for example when someone touches this brick with the script we'll know what hit what hit the part okay and so in this case we're calling it hit so we need to check to see if hit is natural player so say if hit dot parent come on find first child humanoid then we know that it is a player that touched it and it's not anything else like a brick might have touched it we don't want that to kill itself we only want to kill a player so we can say hits dot parents curl on break joints and what break joints does is it basically any joints in the player such as like back joints or neck joints will be broken and the player will fall apart so they basically die and they will have to be respawned so we're checking if something touches the brick and hit is whatever touched it and if that's hit is a player if it has a humanoid object in it which only players have then we're gonna break its joints and it's going to die so let's go and test this out let's go and con this arrow where it says play and click on play here so that we spawn on this checkpoint and if we touch the lava brick you can see our joints break and all of our body parts they fall apart so we die and we get respawn back to the start so now what we can do is keep pressing ctrl D to duplicate them and we can just add a couple onto this base like this next we're gonna take our checkpoint model again we're gonna duplicate it and we're gonna move it over here and now we can quote our next obstacle which is gonna be a choose path now you might not have heard of these before there are three paths and you have to choose the correct one two of them basically if you walk on them you're gonna fall straight through them and fall to your death but one of them is going to be at the correct path so you're gonna need to choose wisely so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take at this base again which we have and we're going to just duplicate it let's move it over here and just position it down so it's touching the checkpoint and now we're gonna just make it a little bit shorter because we're gonna have our choose path so we're gonna insert three more bricks three bricks for each path so this is gonna be our first path let's just make it wide enough like this we're gonna need to make it small enough so that the base can fit three parts we're gonna duplicate and we're gonna move it across and chip it again and move this one down like that so we now have three paths now we're gonna give each path a different color so this path could be yellow this path can be purple and this one can be blue so we now need to select which path is going to be the correct one so we're gonna have to have two of them which the player will fall straight through and one which will which will work so I'm gonna select these two paths on each side and these are going to be the paths that don't work so we're going to go to this kanka like property and we're going to make it unchecked when can collide is unchecked it means that nothing will collide with a brick it will just fall straight through it so the player is gonna fall straight through the purple one and the yellow one now we're gonna do we're gonna actually keep can collide set to true on the blue one but we're gonna select all of our paths and make sure that anchored is set to true so they don't fall out of the sky now let's clone our base again and we'll clone the checkpoint but whilst we're just here let's take our current obstacles that we have so we'll select the base and the three choose paths and we will group these together and we'll call this model choose path just that everything's organized and each path I will call that a path instead of parts like that and let's just go back to our lava jumps here and click and drag to select all of our lava bricks and the base okay so now we can just ctrl G to group them and I'm gonna call this lava and jumps okay so now we have grouped everything together it looks really nice and organized let's create our final obstacle this is going to be some bull jumps so a bit like the rainbow jumps but the player would have to jump on some balls so let's insert a part so we're gonna click on the arrow and click on sphere then we're gonna hold down shift again and click on the green circle on the scale tool and just scale them up and we will just position them in the middle here and what we can do is we can duplicate now instead of having the bricks duplicate on top of each other you can click on collisions over here and that will mean that they don't collide with each other so they're going to be duplicated in the same place so we can just drag them apart like this okay one two three four and we'll do one more and what I'll also do is just take a couple of them and move them from side to side so it's a little bit more challenging and then we can go back to the model model tab and use the color action as tool over here so we can do one as red one as green blue a pink one an orange one so there we go that's our final obstacle completes let's make sure that they're all anchored and we're gonna just group them together and we're gonna call them balls now I'm just gonna make sure each part is also called ball so we know what they all are and there we go we've finished our obstacle course now let's just add our final winner section we're gonna duplicate one of checkpoints and let's move it along again like this but because it's the winner zone we're gonna make it a little bit bigger so we're gonna use what we've learnt we're gonna hold down shift and then we're gonna use the scale tool on the yellow circle to make it a little bit bigger like this then I'm just gonna make sure that it's able to be jumped on from the final block and there we go we have completed our obstacle course in under 20 minutes now I'm gonna show you how to publish your game to roblox so that you can play it with your friends so you're gonna want to click on file then click on publish to roblox as and then it will load up your places click on creating you and we're gonna call it my avi or you can call it whatever you want make sure that you you select public on privacy and also you can take a snapshot for a thumbnail click on ok it's gonna take a snapshot and also you can change some details here about your game their maximum amount of players that you can have I will set that to 40 but it's up to you whether you want the IP servers enabled or whether you want to sell your game but we just keep keep this at default right now I'm gonna click on create place once you've done that it's gonna create the game for you it's gonna upload your place and when you click on next you'll be taken to this link so take this link right click copy it and click on done then head to your web browser and just paste the link right in there and it's gonna take you to your game alternatively you could go to create and you'll see it there but we can click on play and we will be able to play our own roblox and game so here we go waiting for a server and join in and there we go this is what we've just created in roblox to do in our own game look we can chat we can II danced we can do everything so let's try it out and make sure it works and that there's no bugs or anything if you can't complete your office of course so you might need to go back and fix it so that it's easier for the players so I'm gonna go back over here and I'm just gonna move this a little bit closer to the green one like that there we go so we can republish again by going to file and publish to roblox this time we already have it published so we're going to publish it to another game we're just updating it and we can head back in I've just added some fixes I've made the some of the obstacles a little bit closer together so that we won't we won't be able to fall off them we don't want them to be impossible because if they were then our players wouldn't like that and they would start down voting our game we don't want to get thumbs down so you want to make sure that you keep testing your game before you launch it and testing out new updates so that you know that everything works perfectly because that way you can have a great game that people love alright so on to the balls again I see if we can do them this time onto the green one there we go on to the blue one on to the pink one and the final one the orange one there we go boom boom boom we have completed our own obstacle course so there we go we're in the winner section now think of some things that you might want to add to the winners section you could add for example a little sign which says congratulations or you could add some things from the tool box as well if you wish so there's lots to experiment with with your first robots game but there you go in 20 minutes you've just learned how to create your own robot game from scratch
