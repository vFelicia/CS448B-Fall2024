sometimes in Roblox we want to detect when an object in the game changes and there's a multitude of reasons why you might want to do this perhaps you want to detect when a player's Health changes so you can update your custom health bar or if perhaps the Player's leader stats change you might want to save that to your data store okay these are just some examples they're not necessarily the the main uses but I just want to teach you today how you can detect when an instant AKA and object in Roblox changes even if one of its you know most hidden properties changes we will know about it so it's fairly straightforward you just need to firstly get an instance we'll just use this folder for example in the workspace you say dot changed and you will see it says fired immediately after a property okay it's just gone off the screen there after a property of the instance changes so whenever you change a property or if the game changes it you know if something happens maybe it moves and the position property changes perhaps you change its name perhaps some other script changes it we will know about it so you'll connect it to a function and then in this function we also have the name of the property that's what Roblox hands to us and we can print out name of property and we can concatenate this to some text to say has changed and let's run this let's see what happen happens so nothing happens straight away that's because nothing has changed in the folder but let's change the name of the folder and it will say name has changed okay let's move the folder to a different location let's put it into server script service let's change the parent property oh look you can see the parent has changed so that is how it works and now a folder doesn't have that many properties so it's not the best uh object to use in order to to explain this to you but let's create a part and let's change our script to instead use that part and we'll show you a few more so don't worry about this one this is a property to do with the the network that Roblox controls but let's move this part around and you can see suddenly all of the time nearly every single frame is printing out orientation has changed rotation has changed position has changed C frame has changed and that is because we're moving the object now let's let go and you can see it suddenly stops let's change the color and every time we change the color you can see it's printing every frame to say we have a new brick color or new color so really really powerful because you can detect when things change in the game and again this applies to every single property and sometimes you don't want to attach a listener to every single property because it is a little bit over the top right if you only want to listen out for when one specific property changes why would you want to listen for the others all it's going to do is take up more processing power in your game okay albeit a slight amount but still for the best practice if you only want to track one specific property rather than saying changed you can say Gameworks space. part obviously to get the the thing you want to reference uh colon get property changed signal and in these brackets you want to give the name of the property so if we want anchored for example then we would just say anchored and then this function will return an event okay this is our event we've got it here because we chose the changed event but what this is going to do is it's going to create a custom event for us for when this specific property and this one only changes and it will return it so we can now imagine we've got our event so like we do with other events in roblo we can just connect it to a function nothing to pass here because we obviously know the name of the property if this is firing it's got to be the anchored property and so then we can print the anchored property has been changed now let's remove the original changed event we no longer need that because we're using get property changed signal and let's test this out again so what we should expect to see is when we move the part nothing should happen when we change the name nothing should happen right but let's change the anchored property and watch the output to see what happens it's printing out that the anchored property has been changed now where would you use get property change signal okay most of the time this is used for values okay and it's been quite common in Roblox that people will well game developers will create a value for the status bar okay and it will usually go in rep licated storage and it will display text which will appear on player screens such as intermission or round is starting or round over and typically you set this value on the server okay and because the server has the authority to change it you don't want anyone else to be able to change it because why would you the game is controlled on the server and you know you could control it to say intermission you know perhaps 5 seconds later you'd want it to say um round starting this is a very very top level um implementation not not detailed in any regard but you get the idea right and what what would happen is then on the client where the GUI is Right you'd have um you'd have a text label and you'd have a script in there which would listen out to see when the value property of this status string value changes and when it does change well we want to to update our little status bar over here and so what you do is you would say game. replicated storage do status get property changed signal because we're only interested in when the value changes and then we'd connect to a function and when it updates we'd say script. parent. text equals game. replicated storage. status. value okay and yes you would want to set it when the player first joins to whatever the current value is um but what you would then see is when we just join the game we'll just set this to have no text to begin with click on play here you'll notice every time we update it from the server which should be round about now it updates on the client because the get property changed signal is firing because this value is changing so that is how you make a status bar I bet you weren't expecting that um in a changed and get property changed signal tutorial okay you've got three for the price of one there you've got changed get property change signal and also a status bar thrown in so hope you found that useful if you did please leave a like uh subscribe for more tutorials let me know in the comments as well what other videos you'd like to see and I'll see you in the next one thank you for watching
