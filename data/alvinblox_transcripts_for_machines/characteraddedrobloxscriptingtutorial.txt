okay today I'm going to show you how to detect when a player spawns or joins a game so obviously we have game. players. player added this event will run when a new player joins your game and it gives us a handy argument of player so whatever we do to the player will be done to a player who joins but this doesn't tell us when their character has loaded because there's two parts to when a player joins the game it's when their player first joins which usually contains all the information about the player contains their UI their backpack whatever but it doesn't actually contain their character because their character is a separate object in the workspace so if we wanted to do things such as um give them walks speed give them a chat sorry give them an overhead tag uh teleport them somewhere we'd have to do this stuff to their character which I like I said is in the workspace so how do we get their character well to get it we just say player doch character but but by the time the player joins the game and this function runs the character is likely to have not loaded yet so we have to wait for the character to load and usually when it loads um we can just detect it via an event called character added so character added connect function and just like player added it gives us a an argument for that character so whatever we do to this character argument will be done to their character so for example if I said character .h humanoid walkspeed equals 100 and I click on play here you will notice that when we join I've got 100 speed now there's all sorts of things you could do here you could obviously give them a tag like I said um but this is a super simple way to get a player's character bear in mind though that sometimes when the character's added I've found myself that um parts of the character still may not be loaded so if you want to sometime say you wanted to get like the humanoid root part uh perhaps it's worth using a little weight for child there just to make sure it's fully loaded uh that's what I found in my experience however you've just got to make sure that this player added event is able to run when your game starts for example if you have this after a lengthy period of time such as a weight it's not the first thing that executes in your script well the event isn't going to be set up in time to register me joining the game right because we only set up the event after 10 seconds so it can only start listening for someone to join the game after that time so you want to make sure that your player added is running straight away and you also want to make sure that the player added is is pretty much at the top of your function here because again you might miss a player joining the game anyway that was how to detect when a character spawns uh let me know if it was useful anything else you'd like me to make a video on subscribe as always and I'll see you next time
