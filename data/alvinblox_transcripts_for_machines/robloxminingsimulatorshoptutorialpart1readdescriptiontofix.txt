in this video I'm going to be showing you how to create a mining simulator shop on a roblox so that you can enter the shop like this and be able to buy different items in your game and equip them if you need to much on all make sure to subscribe and click on the notification bell so you never miss out when I upload a brand new video okay so let's get started now I might have a few things which you might not be able to access in your studio and this is because I have quite a few plugins installed to my roblox studio for example this time tracker and I also have some other ones which we might be using in this tutorial so I recommend you download some of them and I will be letting you know when we use them just so that the tutorial can be a little bit quicker and we can have this mining simulator shop made in much faster time so let's begin the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to create a backdrop and this is the backdrop that you're going to see when you enter the shop where all the items are so let's insert a part and let's just call it backdrop and once you've done that we're just going to make the backdrop quite long and we're going to just make it wide enough so we can have some boxes on it and then we're gonna want to copy and paste or duplicate this part and we're gonna just resize it so that it's a back wall just like this so when we open the shop what we're going to do we're going to position our camera so that the camera is looking at the wall like this and then we will have a box in the middle of our screen containing the item so let's go and select these two items these two parts let's make sure that they're anchored in the properties window you need to open up the properties window the Explorer window now you don't need to open the game panel and you also will need to open up the output when we do the scripting so once we've done that we can give it some color I'm gonna make mine grey and you want to make sure that they're called backdrop then you can anchor the tank group the two parts together by pressing ctrl G and we can call this model backdrop you need to call your models exactly the same as what I call them else the script might not work we're then going to want to start designing our box now we're gonna have to actually create our box now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this box in from the place file so you can see what it looks like so this is what we're gonna be making it's a box so it's got its got one two three four five sides including the bottom so five different parts and in the middle we've got a box or part called the hip box this is where the tool is going to go in so if we want to buy a gun and the gun is going to go inside this hip box or in the hitboxes position and then we've got another part called the cam part and this is where the camera is going to be looking so you can see the parts here so the camera is going to be looking this way okay where where the blue circle is so the camera view will look like this so we're going to take this box and we're gonna position it over here at the start and we're just going to rotate it so that the camper is looking directly at the gray wall like this so this is what the camera will be looking like when we go into the shop now we're just going to extend the backdrop a little bit further so that we can actually see the wall instead of the rest of the world so if we go and have a look now you can see we just see the backdrop and it's starting to look more like a mining simulator shop as you'd see in a hit game so what we're gonna do now what's gonna happen is we're gonna have this box I'm gonna create a script which will take this box and duplicate it for however many boxes or items we have in the game so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this box 0 and it's very important that it's called box 0 and it has all of these different parts in it you have to have a hit box and you have to have a camp art now I would suggest you just take the model which will be in the description and you add this into your game just so that it saves time and you know what you're doing because once you have my model you can change it however however you want it to to be and it will still work so we're gonna take the box 0 and the backdrop and we're going to just group these together so now we've got one big model and we can call this model the item roller okay make sure to spell it just as I do and now that is the first part of the video done the main part where the boxes are going to go so what we can do is we can insert a script and we can begin working on on scripting it so that it inserts enough boxes for each item in the game so let's go into service script service here and insert a script and we shall get to the scripting part so if we just go into the script make a little bit bigger and what we want to do is we want to get the number of tools that we're gonna sell in the game so in the server storage what we're gonna do is we're going to I don't mind this folder it's just because I've got a plugin in studio we're going to do is we're going to insert a folder in fact we're going to insert a few folders while we're at it they'll eat this one we're gonna insert a folder called tools we're gonna insert another one which is called player tools and another one which we're going to call tool models this will all make sense in a minute and that's all we need we just need one folder cool tools uncle tool models and another one called player tools so what we're gonna do with these folders for player tools we're going to store all of the tools which the player has so it will be their inventory so that we can equip and unequip certain tools from this inventory the tool models is where we're going to store the actual tool objects and the tools folder is going to what actually the tools folder is where all of the tools are going to be stored which the player will be able to equip the tool models is where we're going to just put the the model or the handle of the tool so it's not going to be an actual working tool it's just going to be how the model of what the the part which which you'll see so the actual tool so that we can put it in these boxes and then the as we said the player tools will just be like their inventory for each player and then we use saving to save the players tools and load them in when they rejoin the game so what we're going to do we're going to insert some tools into our game now I've got some tools over here which I am going to use so we've got four drills okay and let's just insert them into the workspace now I'm going to do is I'm just gonna move these tools over here but we should have four different tools they're just all in the same position okay so let's just move them out here this okay so we have got a so we've got four drills one of them is called the normal power drill one is called super power drill one is called better power drill and one is called normal power drill so these different tools will be what we're gonna sell now if you have more tools then you're just going to do the same of what we do now and just replicate the process for every new tool that you add and I might go over that at the end if you have more more tools because obviously you're gonna have different tools to me which you want to sell in your game so what we're going to do is we're going to take these tools and just put them into the tools folder just like that what we're going to do now is we're going to want to make copies of these tools so copy them and we want to paste this into tool models okay tool models is where we're going to just have the handle or the parts so what it looks like no scripts or anything so we want to convert this tool into a model what you want to do is you just want to take everything inside of each tool cut it and then insert a model and paste those objects into that model and just give it the same name as the tool which you copied them from so this will become the better power drill model and we can do the same with the epic power drill duplicate it so duplicate everything inside so cut it and then insert a model called epic power drill and we can just insert the children so you get the idea I'm just gonna keep doing this until we have done all of the four tools okay so all of the parts inside of the tools have been converted to models and so now we've got the models of the tools so that we can display them in these boxes so we can now write a script which will take all of these tools and put them up for sale in the shop so to do this we're going to want to create a variable which is going to be where these tools are stored so the tool model section so what we can do is we can go into our script here delete this print hello world and we're gonna say the we want to generate the blocks here so generate blocks now I am using the dark theme in studio you can turn on in settings so we're going to say local number of blocks equals and then we need ooh a hashtag and then we want to have a table after this okay so we're gonna put into a table all of these two models here so we can say game get service and we say server storage and then we can say come on wait for child tall models get children hey so what we're doing here is we are getting server storage which is where the two models folder is waiting for the child to models to be added and we're getting everything inside of two models so every single model here it will become a table now if you don't know what tables are basically looks like this so we've got a variable and then we have all of our different objects here in a table so we would have super power drill example and then for the better power drill epic power drill normal power drill so it's all on the table and it basically allows us to loop through each item on the table and do something for each item so for example we want to create a new box for every item and put that item inside of the box so that we can see it's for sale in the shop and we can move between it so that is a table and what we've done is you've just defined a table here so when you do get children it puts all of your items into a table and then we do the hash tag so that you can see how many items are in that table okay so now we've done that we want to have a stood gap so between each box we want a gap between them okay so the gap is going to be around about nine or ten stood okay so i've tested this out and the gap between this box okay and say if we had another box a gap would be about this much so that it's enough for us to be able to click a button and move on to the next one like this so let's just delete this box and let's go back into the script I want to do local stood gap equal to nine so this is gonna be the gap between each box all right so we want to get our first box so we're gonna do a for loop soon to loop through the number of things for sale I'm gonna clone this box okay so we want to create a variable for this box because I'm gonna be using it quite often so just that we don't have to keep saying you know gained or service storage dots so again it works based on box zero clone we can just have variable for that box so you can say local box equals and game got workspace Curran wait for child item holder box zero ok so we're waiting for this box as this item holder model to be added to the workspace and then we say box zero to get the box template and then we're going to our for loop which creates all of the boxes so if we add another item for sale the script is going to add another box automatically do the positioning and it will put that item into the shop so this tutorial with this this shop is gonna work no matter how many items you have in your game you could start off with one you could then add a 500 different items with their for sale into your game and there would be 500 boxes created so to do this we need a four loop so we can say for now I equals 1 comma number of blocks negative one one do this all makes sense in a moment I'll explain it so what we're doing is we are looping through every single box okay so good so we've got the number of locks here so because we've got this table of blocks we are basically getting a number of how many items are in this table okay so if there's five items in the table number of blocks is going to be five now because we've already got one box added in which isn't going to be added by the scripts because it's already there we're gonna put our first item into box zero okay so the way we're going to do this is we're gonna use this for loop and I is going to be the number of the box which we're currently looping through so on the first time it will be looking for box and then because I is equal to 1 we'll have box 1 but because the template box is called box 0 we want to do we want to start off at zero so we can say number of blocks negative one so we're starting off at 1 Brasi was starting for 0 because we're doing number of blocks minus 1 so what we can do is we can say new box equals box clone new box and now we want to position the bottom of the box so to move it 9 studs away from the last one we can do new box set primary part C frame and then in brackets we can do new box primary part up C frame x C frame new and then we can do 16 x i00 now the reason that we're doing this is let's change this yeah so we're taking the current C frame of the primary part so the box here has to have a primary partner because it's a model you can't just say model dot position you have to get the primary part and whenever you move the primary part everything else in the model will move according to how far the primary parts moved so if the primary part has moved to stood to the left everything else is going to move to stood to the left as well so we are taking the currency frame value and we're just multiplying it on the xaxis so we're basically moving it to the right by 16 stud snow I think we won't use the stud gap actually I think I changed it so that we used 16 which is why might not need to use it so we're moving it 16 studs multiplied by I so if we're on the second box obviously we don't want to move it to the same place as the last box so we remove it by 16 times I so four on second box it's going to move 32 studs from the original box and if it's the third box it's gonna move 48 studs from the first box so you can see as we add more boxes the the increment here is going to be increasing to run our 500th box what's that 500 times 16 is I don't know it's gonna be a long way away from the origin right which is the first box position so that's what we're doing we're just moving this box away from the origin and then we want to give this box and name so it's a new box name equals box now we want to name it box so if it's box 0 the next box is gonna be called box 1 or box 2 or box 3 or box for box 5 so we do dot I and this concatenates the string so you have box and then you add on the number which were currently on and obviously that's going to change so we say I and then what we're going to do is we're gonna just set the parent of this box to put it into the item or roller swings a new box but parent equals game dot work space dot item or rollup just like that so there we go we have now set up the code which is going to add the number of blocks for us now let's go and test this out and see if it works now it might not work because this is the first time we've ever done it but if it does I'll be very good so let's just wait for it to load up and okay so it did not work so let's go have a look maybe we missed out something okay so we've got an error and it says infinite yield or it's not really an error it's a warning but what this means is that there is an infinite yield on item holder so this means it could be waiting forever force for item all dirt mmm sour look it's on on high so I put item holder instead of item roller it should be item roller and if we go and run it again boxes should be created so there we go you can see it has created four boxes each with a stood gap of 16 it's I think soon see first box here box one is 16 studs away from ox 0 box 2 is 32 studs away from the origin and box 3 well the fourth box because this one started at 0 is 48 stood away from the origin because it's the third one from box 0 so there we go that's the first part done we have got our boxes being made and now we just need to code it so that the items get added in to the the boxes all right so let's continue so what we want to do now is you want to loop through all of these 2 models in server storage and we want to create a clone of each model and we want to put this clone we want to put the clone into the boxes ok so if we had say we had 500 models ok we want to loop through obviously putting each model into a new box is gonna be really inefficient ok so if you were just putting it in one by one and updating the game that is not very good at all because say you wanted to take you want to devote an item or take out your game or I don't know change the way it looks you have to you have to move everything else down along so we can just get a script to do this for us so let's go back into our main script and let's just do a in pairs loop so for I comma V in pairs and say game dot server storage and then we say dots tall models held on get children do okay so we're looping through everything inside the tool modules folder I is going to be the number of times it's looped through and V is gonna be the item which we're currently iterating over okay so be could be this one on the first loop on the second loop round it could be this one third time it could be this object on the fourth time it could be this one I'll see on the fifth time it would not run because it's run out of things to loop through so for each item we just want to check to see if there is V so if the items actually there and it hasn't been mysteriously deleted we can say new equals V clone cloning the model and we can set the primary part C frame of that tool new set primary part C frame game dot workspace dot item roller and then in square brackets we want to get the name of the box so we say box dot I minus one now remember because we're starting off at one but remember the boxes start off at box zero and then it goes to box one so we're saying I minus one and then we say got hit box dot C frame just like this so we're setting the primary part I never want to parent this so noodle parent equals game but workspace dot item rollup and then in square brackets we can say in box dot I minus one so what we're doing is we're putting the model into the item roller inside of each box model so as I said earlier we start enough at one so you have to do I minus one to allow it to cater for box zero now if we check this out what should happen is each tool model should be added into its box and it doesn't because it's an error let's have a look so the error says model set privacy frame failed because no primary part has been set or primary part no longer exists now this is a common error and this is because we did not set a primary part to set a primary part of a model if you want to move it you have to click on your model and you have to then click on primary part in properties and select which one you want to be your primary part now in our case with our drills we're gonna set the primary part as base ok it doesn't really matter but we're just gonna set ours to base for each model whenever you add a new tool model you should be doing this so we're gonna do primary part base this one primary part base and on the last one primary part base you've run the game again hopefully all the tours been added but we do have another error and we also can see that the drills have fallen down so we'll have to fix that as well so let's go and stop this and let's have a look so these issues are actually part of of my tool nothing to do with the shop so that's all good the only issue is we just need to make sure that it is anchored so we need to select everything inside each tool this go into properties and set anchored to truth try again this time there we go we've got our models in each box um now this is now when we code our main GUI can we're scripting it's gonna we can click a button and it will move on to the next one click a button it go on to the next one you can see where she's going we've now got all of our items programmed to automatically go into boxes and of course if we add more tools then more box isn't going to be created and it is much more efficient than doing it manually so there we go good progress so far and let's keep going I guess another thing we can do before you start scripting the rest of it the mainframe is we can actually create our shopkeeper in the area which is going to trigger the shop to open when we step on it so what I've done is I have just created a little worktop with a good friend of mine on it so we've got our friend Albert over here also known as an ecoat and we're just gonna put him on the floor here and he is our shopkeeper now what I've got is I've got a character with some props and I've got a work top here and you see I've got this really nice little union which is a semicircle and inside that semicircle I've got another union and this is going to trigger early shops open so we're going to code that later on let's delete that script and I'm just gonna select everything over here and group it to grow that did not that should not happen all right we won't group it together we'll just keep it over here but you can design yours however you want it to to be you just need to have this one part and which is going to trigger the shop to open so we'll get to that later on but there we go so let's continue so we've done the part where we actually show the items which have a sale in our shop the next things that we need to do is we need to design a GUI so that the players can actually click through each item we also need to code their camera so that we can set the camera to look at each box and we also need to create the scripts which will handle the transaction so when you want to try and buy an item we need to do that on the server to make sure that they don't AK and we also need to code saving and we also need to code in equipping system so there's quite a long way to go yet but we've made some good progress so far we've got the boxes so far and the next few bits are kind of moderately advanced it will involve quite a lot of remote events and functions to make it compliant with filtering enabled and they'll also be quite a bit of client scripting as well because we have to loop through each box when we click it and we also need to keep track of which item they're currently looking at
