hello and welcome to part two in how to create a simulator game on roblox series now in the last part we learn how to create a wait which when you lifted it gave you strength and in this video we're going to be creating the rebirth system so when you hit a certain amount of strength you'll be able to rebirth give it up go back to zero and then you'll gain one a rebirth point and then over time the more rebirths that you get the higher the more strength you get and the higher the boundary it is to rebirth again so let's go ahead and get started now I have been very nice I have created a rebirth GUI it looks like this and has a rebirth button and also shows how much strength you need to rebirth I've put this in the description for you go ahead and take the model add it to your inventory then go to home toolbox go to my models and drag it in to the start of GUI what we're going to do is we're going to have the main frame set to visible and I've also given you the local script but I've only defined the variables if you want to take the entire code then you can become a channel member but we're going to be scripting this rebirth system shouldn't take too long let's get into it so first thing that we're going to want to do is we're going to want to script the rebirth button so what we're going to do is we're going to go into the local script here in our wait sorry not gonna wait in the GUI and then I'm just going to make it little bit bigger and what I'm going to do is I'm going to firstly set the text okay so I want to set this text to say how much strength only three berths alright because let's say that the player just joined and their data was saved we're gonna do data saving soon but it's not gonna be 5,000 if they've already rebirthed so what I want to do is we're going to say strength rebirth which is our our text label inside of the main frame in the rebirth menu there is a text label would strengthen rebirth and it basically says how much strength you need so we're gonna go and say strength to rebirth doctor text equals and then in speech marks we're gonna say you need at least and then space dot dot and then we're gonna say math dot floor which rounds a number and then inside of here we're gonna do inside these brackets we can do another pair of brackets and say start to rebirth amount which is the amount of rebirths which is the amount of strength you need to rebirth for the first time i've set this to five thousand at the top of the script so we're gonna take this number and we'll get it add to it the number of rebirths that we have so rebirths dot and value because I've defined rebirths here to just get their leader stats and get the rebirth stat so we're getting that value and we're timesing it by math dot square root I don't know we can just put a random number in here okay so it's gonna times that number by the square root of fifty million okay you don't have to do math on square root I guess you could just actually write in the square root of five million it's up to you you can write it however way you want completely up to you but then what we're gonna do is we're gonna just close off this bracket for the math dot floor that's going to round it to the nearest whole number and then we're gonna do another two can't walk to concatenate it back together and we can say strength to rebirth just like that so it's gonna say you need at least and it's going to put the number in and then then it will say strength to rebirth the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to want to code the the button the menu button which you see over here so that it toggles the GUI on and off so we can go back into the local scripts and we can drop a line and I'm going to get the main button which is the variable that I declared it starts main button dot mouse button wanna click current connect and then we can say in bracket and in bracket function with another pair brackets and then close that off with an end and closing bracket so this is it this is an event it will listen out for when the the main button has been clicked and when it has we're just going to set the main frames visibility to the opposite of whatever it is now so we can say main frame dot visible equals not main frame visible just like this okay and then outside of here we don't need to do anything else because that is that is managing all of the the button now it will open up the GUI when it's closed and obviously close it when it is open so what we want to do we want to do another one of these events for the rebirth button so we can say rebirth button doctor mouse button wanna click Perl on connect and then function again but inside of here what we're going to do is we're going to we're gonna in we're going to create a remote function and we're going to invoke that remote function and that remote function is going to well on the server it's going to check whether a player has enough strength so that they can rebirth now as I said in part 1 we use remote functions and remote events so that the player can't exploit so that they can't give themselves infinite strength and so they can rebirth immediately we do the checks on the server so that we can verify that a player is allowed to do something so we're going to crate the remote event here so I'm going to say in the remotes folder we're going to add in a what I've already added it in but you'll need to opt in yourself it's a remote function called rebirth ok and what I'm gonna do is we're going to then just do a variable ok this is going to store the result which the server returns back to us so we can say local results equals replicated storage and then we can say dot remotes because it's in that remotes folder dot rebirth colon invoke server and that's going to store the resort so what we need to do now is we need to go into the server and we need to script ok so we're going to go into the remotes grits and and begin coding this on the server so here we are in the server script and what we're going to do is we're going to just create a another well not it's not a non server event it's an on server invoking it's a callback function so we have to link up to it to a function and you'll see what the difference is here so we'll say replicate a storage dot remotes dots rebirth and we can say dot on server sorry on yeah on server invoke and then we say equals function okay and then we can just drop a line and add in an end like this you don't need a closing bracket on the end okay so inside of here what we need to do we need to do the same thing as we did in lift and we need to copy this line which checks whether they have a remote data folder okay and we're also going to pass through the argument of the player so we are going to say player over here so we know who called it and then what we're going to do is we're going to store their amount of rebirths as a variable so local rebirths equals player thoughtleader stats dot rebirths and that will just be the number of rebirths that they've got so what we want to do now is you want to check to see if they have enough strength all that required rebirth so we can say if player thoughtleader stats dot strength dot value is greater than or equal to and then in brackets we're going to do the same thing as we did in the local script which is the criteria to be able to rebirth so we're just going to copy this okay and so we're going to do the math dot floor copy that we're gonna go back to the remote script and just paste it in there okay and then we're gonna just say then drop a line and so what we need to do here is we need to define our star to rebirth amount again so at the top what what we could actually do is we could send the star to rebirth amount but then it can easily be exploited so we're just gonna say local starter rebirth amount equals 5,000 the same as we put it local script okay so back in the remotes script what we need to do now is we just need to well obviously if they do have enough strength then we can say rebirth value equals rebirths value plus one so we can add a rebirth we then want to put their strength back at zero so Claire don't leave the SATs dot strength dot value equals zero and then we couldn't respawn them by saying player code on load character just like this okay and then we're going to return back to the local script true to let them know what let the script know that they rebirth successfully and we can display like a success message on their screen but if they don't have enough strength to rebirth we can just say else else return not enough strength okay so that's all we need to do on the server to check to see if they're eligible to rebirth what we can now do is go back to the local script and we can pick up the result which we just returned which we are storing in this result variable and then we'll be able to check it and say whether it was a success or not so what we can do is we can say if results equals equals true so if it is true then we can say rebirth button dot text equals successfully rebirth okay and then we can do wait one so wait one second and then we can set the text again back to what it originally was and that is click here to rebirth okay but else if results equals false sorry not false not enough strength because that's what we returned in the server script then we're just gonna set the rebirth buttons text to whoops we set the back button rebirth button actually we are just gonna interrupt there you don't need the back button here because I actually added it in by mistake because I was trying to add something laughs to the GUI but we need at this part in the tutorial so I'm just going to delete that from the from the variables here so if you don't have it don't panic you can delete it if you have added it in yourself rebirth button dot text equals not strong enough or your own custom message if you want to change that and once again we can wait one second and say rebirth button dot text equals click here to rebirth so what we've done is we've just made it so when they click the button we will make them rebirth and if it's a success then we can display on the GUI that it was else we can say that they don't have enough strength and the last thing that we need to do is we need to have an event which checks to see if their rebirth value changes and if it does we're going to update this strength to rebirth text because this is only updating when they first join the game what if they rebirth during their stay in our game so we can say player and if I we don't see that we can just say rebirth will say rebirths current gets property changed signal and then inside of these brackets the property that we're listening listening for to be changed is going to be the value so when that is changed we can connect up to this function and inside of here we can just copy this code from line 13 and paste in and that's going to update the strength to rebirth text and we don't need to do anything more with that so that should be our rebirth system fully integrated now let's go ahead and test it out so I'm going to close down at the mainframe and see if the button works first I'm going to keep the output open in case we have any errors but the the the menu is opening perfectly if I click on click to rebirth it says not strong enough so let's go ahead and start lifting what I'm going to do is I'm going to go on to the server and give myself 4999 strength and that should say not strong enough there we go my camera seems to have glitched out a little bit or that is because I'm really big and I've gone into the base so don't worry but I'm convened go ahead and left to put me over 5000 strength I'm gonna click here to rebirth and there we go the strength has been reset to zero and I gained a rebirth and if we try again you can see I now need even more strength rebirth and I'm not strong enough I need to start rebirthing again but this time I'm gaining 50 strength per time per click so there we go guys we've just added a rebirth system to our simulator so if you enjoyed this
