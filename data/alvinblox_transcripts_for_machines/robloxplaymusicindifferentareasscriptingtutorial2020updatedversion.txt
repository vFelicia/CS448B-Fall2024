in this video I'm going to show you how to add different sound areas to your game so different music will play if you go to a different area so if we go over here into the desert area you'll be able to hear the music but if we go over here to the water section you'll hear different music and if we head over here by the cars you have something different as well so let's get started so the first thing that you don't want to do is go into the workspace here and create a folder okay this is going to be where we store all of the parts and these parts are going to show the regions where our sounds are going to play okay so I'm gonna have three regions but if you want more than that then you can keep adding these parts as I show you now so in side of the folder while at first we'll go ahead and just name it sound regions like this and once we've done that we can now insert a part so click over here at the top click on parts and then press F to teleport your camera to it now the way this is gonna work is we're going to use this part and we're gonna drag it so that it covers the entire region okay so if we want it to cover this desert area then I can just move it and scale it so that it covers the entire desert area here and as well as that I'm gonna make sure that it covers it on the yaxis as well so everything in the region is completely covered even underneath it as well so if you go you know on higher ground then you're still in in the region here okay so this is gonna be our sound region for the desert area so give it a name so I'm gonna call it a desert area I'm gonna make it anchored set can collide two contracts so the players can walk through it and then you can set transparency to one but I want to keep it as zero for now just to show you it working now once you've done if you want to set up another region then we can just duplicate this part and drag it somewhere else you can also whoops you can also scale it down so we can fit it on and then just scale it out again to cur the entire region so the music will only play if the player is inside of this part so just drag it down and I'm gonna make it there okay so if they're in the water or if they're near it then they're gonna get some different music played so this is going to be called the water area now the names that you call it up to you but I'll keep them simple and rememberable so you know which region is which and lastly we're going to do it this area over here so I'm going to duplicate the part again I'm going to drag it over here and if it goes a bit funny a different rotation don't worry just scale it down you can hold down shift as well when you're scaling and make it flat and then just cover a new region here okay so I'm just going to make sure it covers everything and we'll drag it below the base as well so that everything gets covered by it and a bit above as well okay so that's the third region done and I'm going to call this region sand area okay and just like the other two regions make sure that it's anchored and can collide is set to false so unchecked okay now that we've done that we can go and start scripting this now so what we're going to need is we only need a sound for each area so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into the starter you are here and I'm going to insert a sound okay what all also do is we'll insert a folder as well so we can store all of these sounds so the folder is going to be called region region sounds or sound regions let's call it sound regions because that's why we called our with a folder so for each sound region here we're gonna have a sound in this folder in our starter GUI which is named the same as the part okay so the sound that's going to be played in the desert area is going to be called desert area okay so name it desert area and it has to be spelled correctly as well so exactly the same as desert area appear and make sure has a capital D in capital a so desert area and drag it into your sound regions folder in started GUI now we're going to need to find a sound first so I'm going to go to the roblox develop page I'm gonna click on or create I'm going to click on library then audio and I'm going to search for a sound so we've got Kevin MacLeod here who provides some copyright free music so we're out out to him thanks for that's what that so I've chosen a few and I'm just going to copy the ID here so the the numbers after library I'm gonna copy those I'm just going to paste it into the sound ID property here okay and that is going to roblox is going to find the sound and it's going to come up saying RBX asset ID and if you play it you should be able to hear it okay I think it's I think my sounds can be muted but it will play when we go into the region when we script it soon so I'm just going to do the same thing for the other two regions so we're going to just duplicate this by pressing ctrl D twice now this one's gonna be called the sand area because that's the area over here and the water area alright so you need to make sure the sound names are exactly the same as what you've named the parts over here okay so now we've done this I'm gonna add a different sound ID to each sound so they all play different things okay there we go okay so now they all play different sounds we can begin scripting them so let's create a local script in started GUI here and this is where we're going to just code the music to check if the player is within that region so we're going to be using a region 3 so that basically checks a region from two points and if a player is inside of the region we can play some music so firstly we're going to find a variable for the sound regions folder that is in the workspace for our parts so local sound regions and then we'll put work space so we know which one it is which folder is either in the workspace with a starter GUI equals game dot workspace dot sound regions okay you could say actually we will say wait for child hip come on wait for child sound regions okay so that just make sure that the sound regions have loaded in before we actually start running the code we're also gonna have a variable here for found and we're gonna set that to false to begin with but we're doing this because we're gonna check through each region and once we found a player in one of those regions will set found to true and then once we've looped through them all if it is true then we won't stop them from playing okay so and we'll either start the sounds or stop them from playing and this will make sense soon so we're going to create a while loop okay so a while loop just runs code indefinitely so forever until something specific happens so we're gonna say well wait one do and anything inside of this one this while loop is going to just repeat over and over again with a onesecond delay okay between each time it repeats so we've got the weight one here which is a onesecond wait so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to do a four loop through each sound region so for I comma V in pairs this is how we do a for loop and then we're gonna say sound regions work space and to get all of the regions all these parts inside of that folder we can say gets children all right now get children returns a table with all of those those parts in there okay so I'm gonna say do after that and I is the number of iterations or times it's looped v is the current part which is looping through and if we do something to V is going to happen it's going to do that to the current part of its looping through so for each part we want to check to see if the player is in it okay so we then I'm gonna just firstly set found it to false because if we set it to true previously we want to reset it now alright and it will all make sense soon so it's all found stuff and but we're gonna say local region g'loona create a region 3 now a region 3 is it's it's kinda like a cube ok so imagine this is this is our region it's made a pervert one point over here and another point over here okay and from those two points it can create a cube and then we can see if a player is inside that region so we're gonna use these parts these sound regions to create a region 3 and then we can check to see if players are within bounds because touched events they can be a little bit you know they they're not the best for doing this sort of stuff region 3 is the best way to detect if a player is currently in a region so we can say local region equals region 3 dot new and then we need to define the two points so as I said earlier two points quite a cube and to get these points from the parts we can use their position values and we can take away half of the size from the position and that will give us both both edges in case of both points so the first point is going to be the current position of the part take away its half of its size so you can say V dot position minus V dot size over 2 all right and that's just going to be the first point and then the second point is going to be a V dot position plus and then in brackets we can say V dot size over there we go real size so and they're both the same apart from we're subtracting here and ABing and on the second point so it's going to create two points and from those two points the region will be created so what we can then do is check to see if there's any players inside of that region so to do that we can say local parts because I want to get the parts in a region so the players body parts and to do this we say game clock workspace find parts in region 3 with white list okay because we're only looking for the players character no one else but usually find parts in region 3 would return everything in there so it would even return the the cars and the bikes but we don't want that we only want to see if the players characters in there right or any of their body parts so firstly we say the region that we're checking so the region we just define as a variable now they were gonna do a comma and we're going to just say the all of the players body parts so to do that we can say game dot players a local player because that is the the player that this script is going to run on cuz it's a local script and each local script runs on on each player's computer so we can get the character from local player and we can say get descendants so get descendants will return a list of every single item inside of the character again no matter what if it's nested in another part so if we were to say get descendants on this model here instead of just returning the children it would return every child inside of of each part here and if there was say something else in this mesh it would return that as well so literally everything in that model in the place model will be checked to see if it's in the region so we then because the parts sorry find parts in region 3 returns a table we then need to loop through that table and see if it is a part from the player's body ok so we can say for underscore because we don't need the the iterator in this case because we've already said what is over here we've got a nested for loop we can say for underscore comma but then because we need to know the part which were currently looping through cause we're going to loop through them all one at a time we're gonna say parts although it is up to you in pairs and we're going to loop through the parts table do so this is gonna loop one by one through the parts table and then we want to see if this part is a child of our player ok so we can say find first ancestor and that will look for the first parent of that of that part which is called a player's name ok so let me just give you an example here if we head into the game and I just say I get my character here and we're looking at my original size value here and fat we'll do this right shoulder motor 60 here and if we say find first ancestor of album blocks ok well it's going to look for its first parent which is the rights of prom and it's going to say alright is this called Alvin blocks okay no it's not so we're gonna go to the next pattern okay so this part is a child off the model called album blocks okay and there we go we found it so the first ancestor called album blocks is this model okay so we need to say if parts come on fine first ancestor so fine first parent pretty much that is called a specific name and that name is going to be a player's name so game to players that local player name then so if if there is a a player found in that region in that table because this part here is a part found in the region because it's returned from pine parts in region 3 then we can just print that a player was found in the region and we can set found to true because we found a player in a region ok and then we can break out of this for loop because we've already found a player we don't need extra confirmation from the other body parts to say that there there there ok else however else if they are not there is not an ancestor in that region for any of the parts then found it's just gonna keep being set to false and it will never be true right and because then we can print player was not found in region okay so it wasn't found in the region for that specific parts okay so the found will be always be set to false and then outside of here outside of this this for loop we can say if found is equal to true then we want to start playing some music okay and so what we can do is we can go to the players player GUI because everything in the started GUI is replicated the player GUI we can look into this sound regions folder and we can just find the sound which has the same name as that region okay of of thee because it's it's getting a little children for the sound regions folder in the workspace we can find the name of that region and just played the sound with the same name so we can say if and because they scripts stop parents and we'd say dots at sound regions and then we can say in square brackets the dot name because that's the same name as the region part dot is playing is equal to false so if it's already playing then so if it's already playing then we won't we won't touch it because you know it's all it's already playing and we don't want to restart it again if it's not though if it's not playing already we can say scripts not parents stop sound regions and say V dot name I'm gonna say code on play and that will just start playing that sound and then we can break break out of this for loop up here because we don't want to check the other sound regions because if a player is in one region then there's no way they're gonna be in another region at the same time okay unless they're there together right but they're not so and it's all good so we've broken out of here else if they haven't been found let's just put an else here then we're gonna just stop the current music okay so script stop parent well we're gonna stop playing the music for that specific region if they're not already in it okay if it even if it wasn't playing already we can say script top pair n't not sound regions and we say be not name stop okay and like this all you need to do the sound regions so let's go ahead and see if it works we're gonna go and I'm just play here so we're in the middle of the map and I'm going to give myself a bit of walk speed as well so that we can just quickly get round them out I'm gonna start 50 and let's go so run over here and let's see if the music starts playing turn up my sound check out the output there we go please play then it will stop and if you go into another region into another region there we go it's playing over here as well so there we go we've done our sound regions now you don't have to add these prints here you can comment them out and that's what I'm gonna do because we know for sure that it works now and I've done a white one because these Region three calculations if we do them all the time then they might start to lag a bit but and a one second delay is perfectly fine and because it stops the music you know the the maximal time that music can be playing if you've left the region is a second okay but that's all good and there we go we've just created sound regions so you can now set your parts to be fully transparent and if we then head in again it will look more realistic okay there we go playing leave it it stops playing so there we go guys we've just created sound regions in a roblox studio if you enjoyed this video please leave a like don't forget to
