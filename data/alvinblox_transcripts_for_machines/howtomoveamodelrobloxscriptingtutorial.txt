I'm going to show you how to move a model in Roblox studio in 2024 or Beyond um because it used to be the case that if you wanted to move a model you would have to give it a primary part and then you'd have to say set primary part C frame so let's say we have this model here just going to Anchor it to make sure it doesn't fall over if I wanted to move this using a script I just need to say pivot 2 like this and what this will do is every model has a pivot point you can see this small blue circle in the middle of the arrows here that's the pivot location of the model and when you say pivot 2 it essentially moves that point to wherever you want and then the rest of the model will move with it so you can put your CF frame into these parentheses 30 30 30 and run this code and it is moved it's moved it up here uh so that's it basically and if you want to get a cframe of a model you would say local cframe well we'll just say CF equals game. workspace model colon get pivot and that will return the cframe if you wanted to then get the position you would say cf. position and you can print it out just like so 30 30 30 so that's how you move a model in Roblox Studio super simple really easy uh let me know if you enjoy it and let me know if you have any more ideas for videos I'll be happy to hear them thanks for watching
