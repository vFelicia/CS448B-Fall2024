in this video I'm gonna show you how you can create your own OB checkpoint system in roblox studio so that when you reach the next stage in an obstacle course your checkpoint will be saved and so that if you die you won't get teleported back to the start you will only get teleported back to your most recent checkpoint now my name is Alvin blocks I teach loads of people like you how to make their own road blocks and games and earn lots of robots from them so if you're interested in that type of video content then do consider subscribing and hitting the bell so you don't miss out on future videos really does help my channel shoutout to Wolfie games who suggested the idea for this video in the last vid let's get straight into it firstly we're going to insert a folder into the workspace I'm going to call this folder checkpoints next we're going to insert the team's service so he can't see teams listed in the Explorer you're gonna need to click on model and then service but you should see the team's folder so click on the + next to it and insert a team now for each stage in your obby you're going to want to create a new team so the first team is going to be called stage 1 ok and you're going to want to set Auto assignable to a false so uncheck that Auto assignable box and you can also give a team color ok now you're also going to for each stage you're going to want to insert a spawn so click on the model tab and click on spawn this will insert a spawn location now it's really important that you set the name of the spawn location to the same as the stage name in teams so for stage 1 this born will be called stage 1 because we've got a stage one team 4 as well we're going to put it inside with the checkpoints folder they all need to be inside the checkpoints folder but also what's most important is that you go into the properties window and you can open that by clicking on view properties and if you scroll down here to the team section you want to make sure that allow team change on touch is checked you want that to be true but change neutral to be unchecked ok and you don't need to bother about the team color we'll get to that later on so what we should have is a spawn location and a team both with the same name for each stage so once you've done that you can copy the spawn location I'm gonna duplicate it by right clicking and clicking duplicate and that will create a clone of it I'm going to drag this one all the way over to my next stage okay and now that it's there I need to rename it because we're no longer at stage one so we'll change this one to be called stage two so we should have a spawn location called stage one over there and one called spawn location over here now you need to do the same thing for the team's we're gonna insert a another team in fact I'm gonna right click and duplicate this team I'm going to call it stage two and I'm going to change the team color to something different it has to be a different color you can distinguish them so I'm gonna keep doing this for all the other stages so duplicate the spawn location drag it over to the next stage I know we've got two stages in one here but that's because there's no space over here that doesn't matter I'm gonna call this spawn location stage 3 but because we need a team to go with it I'm gonna duplicate one of these teams rename it to stage 3 and choose a different team color now really important that auto assignable is set to false here it must be false and also very critical that each spawn location again allow team change on touch is checked that's so that when you step on a new spawn you you your checkpoint will get saved so you can spawn back at that checkpoint and the neutral is false and that just stops people from skipping to the end and being assigned to a random spawn we don't want that so make sure it's false and you can leave the team color as well that's important so just leave as is okay so I'm going to do one more now for the final stage you can also press control D to duplicate by the way change to stage four I'm gonna duplicate another team if you have more stages just keep on doing this for for all the different stages so there we go we've got stage one two three four and for each team there was a spawning location to go with it excellent so now we can begin the coding so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to click on the plus on service crypt service and I'm going to insert a script you need to do that as well now once the scripts in the game I'm gonna rename it to checkpoint scripts just so that we know that's what it's going to be managing it's going to be doing the checkpoints but you can name it whatever you like now in the script firstly I'm going to write a variable and that variable is going to be a reference to this folder and it's going to get all of the spawns which are stored inside this folder and it's going to return it to us in table form now table form is kind of like a list and it's going to be a list of all of the spawn all of the stage spawns in that folder so I'm then going to write a for loop and what this for loop will do is it will loop through every single spawn checkpoint in that folder in that list table that we've just gotten from this variable that's why we've got that variable in here because that's what we're looping through so basically what it's going to do is any code inside this for loop will run for every single checkpoint so currently we haven't set the team color of the spawn locations yet and we've done that for a reason because for each spawn location you need to set the team color to the same color as that team okay but because that can get you know quite boring having to do that over and over and over again for each spawn what we can do is we can use a script that will do it for us and that's why it's so important that you use a different team color for each stage so you don't want to have two teams with the same color okay so what we'll do is we will say checkpoint dot team color equals and then we can get the team object out of the team's service by saying game dot team's Kurland find first child and that's going to find the first team object in there with the name that we give so the name that we wanted given these brackets is going to be the name of the checkpoint because if you remember we've named the checkpoint the same thing as team so we know that the team name is going to be the same as the checkpoints name so he can just get the team by saying game teams find first child and then the checkpoint name goes in here oh yes when you say dot team color on the end here because we're getting the team color property and what that will do is it will update the team color for every single spawn location and when you do that when we're setting the team color of the spawn location checkpoint we are connecting it to that team so that when you step on it it's gonna change your team color to look at that team so when you step on stage three and the team color will be set to really blue that's a way of connecting them so that your team can be set to stage three and when you die you will go back to the spawn of stage three and now each spawn location should be linked to that spawn it's that team sorry let's have a look in the properties window you can see yep the team color for this spawn is bright red if we go into team's stage one you can see it's also bright red so stage two is lime green let's look at stage two the spawn location that's also a lime green so they're now connected and that means when I get to the next stage and I step on that stages spawn location because the allow team change on touch property is true look at the leaderboard it's gonna change me to step two to stage two because stage two shares the same color as the team color of this spawn so when I stepped on it it would change my team color and if we now were to die we wouldn't want to restart all the way at the beginning it would teleport us to that spawn the spawn of the the links born of that team and it's linked because it's connected through team color so we've respawn back at our checkpoint how cool is that okay now what you can also do in the checkpoint scripts is do the same thing but with the color so you could say checkpoint brick color equals and just put the same line of code here because it's still the same color of the team and that should change the color of the checkpoint let's have a look there we go so now we've got the different colors and if you want to update the color for each spawn don't change it on the spawn location brick change it in the teens in the team's service he changed the team object so if I change the first one to electric blue I haven't changed the spawn location and that's because it's automatically going to update so it saves us all the work and now if I need to add more stages I just need to add a new spawn location change its name and add a new team and the work has been done for me so you can now put in as many spawns and stages as you like and it will work seamlessly now the final thing that we have to do is we need to set the players team due stage one when they begin because right now we're just spawning above the first sport and that's because it's in the center of the map so what we're going to do is when I'm making new script we're going to duplicate the checkpoint script and when I call this script player team and what we're gonna do is we're gonna say game dot players dot player added this is an event and it will run whenever a new player joins the game so game dot players the player added connect function player and then we can save player dot team equals game dot team's dot Stage one and that will set the players team to stage one as soon as they join the game if we have a look here before we even step on the spawn our team is already stage one so that's brilliant ok so that's the end of this video and I've shown you how to create a or B checkpoint system please do like the video and subscribe to my youtube channel if it has helped you and share it with a friend as well who you think will be interested in learning this because it didn't take long did it under 10 minutes and in the next video I will show you how to save a player's team because you don't want a player to leave the game and then rejoin later on and have to complete the obby all over again so we're gonna learn how to save their checkpoint and load it so that they spawn back where they left off so make sure you're subscribed and you've got the notifications on my channel so you don't miss that you really don't want to miss that one and I'll see you in the next video you can go to the next video actually by clicking the thumbnail on your
