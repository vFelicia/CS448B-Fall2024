hello welcome to video number six in my scripting series today we're going to be looking at functions what they are how you can use them and why you should use them so let's get started and in my previous video we went over instancing and variables so if you don't understand what this means go ahead and check them out I'll put a link in the top right corner over here and also in the description so what I've done here is I have created a block of code which in the script the code will create a part give it a name set its properties its brick color anchored position whatever and it will put it in the workspace now if we run this script you can see our part has been created exactly how we want to do so this is my part and I've only generated one part so far but if I wanted to generate five parts let's say then I would just copy and paste this code five times and there we go one two three four five I should now have five parts generated okay they've been generated they're all in the same place though so if we just drag them out one two three four five so we've got these five parts and if we head back to our scripts we now have 50 lines of code in our scripts just to generate five parts which seems quite a lot and if you just wanted to do the same thing over and over again this just seems really unnecessary having to write out 50 lines of code to insert five parts and maybe you'd want more parts in your game perhaps you perhaps you would like 500 parts right you're not going to want to copy and paste this out 500 times look we were already at 200 lines so this is just not efficient and it's gonna take up way too much space in our scripts and it's just gonna look horrible for anybody who wants to look at it so if we wanted to insert a part multiple times or we wanted to do an action a number of times we could save ourselves having to copy and paste the same code over and over again by making it a function and a function is a defined set of code which will run when we call it by a name so if I wanted to create a function to generate a parts then I would only need to write out all of this code once and then I could call the function by its name say 50 times and it would reduce the number of lines of code that I'd have to write significantly so let's create a function I'm going to show you how to create one so firstly you have to tell the scripts that you want to create a function we do this by saying function and it should appear in blue if you've got the default script editor colors which you probably have once you've told it you want half a function we're gonna have a space and then we're gonna write the name of this function so you can name it whatever you like and this is what we're going to well the name that you give to this function is what you will write when you want to call it later on so I'm going to name this function to generate parts for obvious reasons I just calling the function by what it's going to do and then I'm going to have a pair of brackets or parentheses or whatever you call them in in your language and these brackets I will explain them in a future video but they're very important for using functions we're not going to be talking about them today but you need those brackets on the end and that's just syntax that's just how we write functions then drop a line and you should have an end added in by roblox you need to make sure you have this end added here because it tells the script where this function ends so now that we've created our function any code we want to execute when we call the function any code that wants to run when we call it needs to go in between these two lines so needs to go in this space here so we're going to take our code to generate a part we're just going to cut it out and we're gonna put it I'm gonna paste it inside of here now when you are using a function when you got code inside of a function you have to make sure it's organized and it looks good so we're going to indent it we're going to move it along to the side so to do that we highlight it and we press tab on the keyboard and that will just make sure it's it's organized it looks pretty and so that you know that that's just the way that we do it and how other scripters want it to look like so that's as good practice so now that we've got our function we've generated it we've given it a name generate parts and we've put the code that we want to run when we call it inside here so now surely if we run the scripts that should generate our part as usual because it's just executing this function well know if you'd listened to earlier and when I said about having to call it you realize that these scripts will not do anything and it will not run any code inside of a function until you call it by its name so even though we've defined this function it's not going to do anything we've just told the script what we want to do when we call this function by its name when we trigger it we haven't triggered this function yet we haven't triggered it by saying its name so if you wanted to run this function you'd have to call it by its name so we just say generate parts and we then need to put these brackets on the end to let the script know it's a function that we're going to call so when we write the name of our function and the two brackets the script is going to look up this function which we've already defined earlier in the script it's going to find it and then it's going to execute any code inside of the function so unless you call the function down here the script this is going to ignore this so now that we have called it by its name and we run the game it should insert our part for us so there we go it's inserted one part because we've got to this point in the scripts realize that we want to call this function and it has executed the code in here to create a part now if I wanted to insert five parts ago all I would need to do is copy this line which calls the function and paste it five times and already you can see that this has saved us having to write out the whole instance new and all of these properties that we want to edit we can just call this function five times run the script and there we go one two three four five parts generated in just 18 lines not even that if you count the whitespace so you can see how functions allow you to save time if you are repeating the same code over and over again and not only do they save you time but they also make your code look much neater this code is way way WAY neater than the original and that when we had like 50 lines or whatever we don't even need to scroll down we can just see everything in one go and this is just good good clean code that we've written so we've used a function and we've called it to repeat the same code that we wanted to execute all we need to do need to write out once and then we can call it as many times as we like very very good so that is what a function does it executes code which we have defined already down here when we call it now a few things you have to define a function before you execute it so this whole function generate part end stuff and any of the code inside here that is that this this this part is defining the function telling the script what to do when we call it because if we call this function and remember that the script goes line by line it doesn't start that it doesn't start down here it starts up here so it goes on line 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 until it gets down here so it goes step by step from the top so if we called our called our function at the top and then defined it later on you can't do this because if the script is running from the top and it sees generate parts well we haven't got and the script doesn't know that this that we are going to be calling a function because we haven't defined it at this point it's only until line 8 that this function is defined so if we run the game we're gonna get an error and it says attempt to call global which is the function but it doesn't know it's a function that's why it doesn't say function because it hasn't been defined yet so it just it just thinks it's a global attempt to call this thing called generate part and then it's saying it's a nil value when it's a nil value it means that it's nothing it hasn't been defined as anything yet so generate part is currently equal to nothing it has no meaning until you get to line 8 until you define the function until when when you define it after the function sorry when you call it after the functions been defined you can see no error and it runs perfectly five times so that is what a function is a function allows you to put code that you're going to be executing multiple times in there so you don't have to keep writing it out but it will save you time it'll make your scripts look nicer and this is only the beginning functions are really powerful and in the next videos we'll be looking at how to pass information when you call your function you can pass information to it so that your parts can be dynamic and they don't have to all be the same maybe on line 14 you want to generate a loop pass right which has a transparency of not 0.5 and maybe down here you then want to have a red part which is much bigger in the next few videos we'll be looking at how to pass information to these functions which will make them much more advanced and it will actually it will give you more meaning as to why we use functions because right now you might be thinking oh well I don't really get the point of this we can just copy and paste the code out it's not that big of an issue and yes you could say that but in the next few videos you will also see why functions are so powerful and why you will be wanting to use them so thanks for watching as I said check out my other videos in this playlist I've got lots of them so far this is the sixth one so you've got five other ones to watch if you've just stumbled upon this one right now and there are gonna be more coming soon so by the time you're watching this video there might be another one out so click on the thumbnail on the right side of your
