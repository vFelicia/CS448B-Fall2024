in this video I'm going to show you how to create a Tycoon on Roblox so the first thing you want to do when you're in Roblox studio is click on this new button in the top left corner and then select base plate next you'll want to make sure that you've got the Explorer panel and the properties panel opened up if you haven't then all you need to do is click on The View tab here at the top and then make sure that the Explorer panel and properties button are both selected once you've done that you should see your Roblox Studio set up just like this some of your panels may be in different areas of the screen that's fine the first thing we're going to do is we're going to build our Tycoon and you can do this by using the part button which you can find underneath the Home tab right here so click to insert a few parts and then use the four tools select move scale and rotate to manipulate them however you'd like so here's my Tycoon I've just got a very basic part here and some surrounding walls I'm going to select them all and then in the properties panel I'm going to scroll down and make sure that the anchored property is checked this will make sure that the parts don't fall apart when the game begins next we're going to want to create a button for players to step on if they want to purchase items in the Tycoon so again let's head up here and click on the model tab or the Home tab and choose part here then I'm going to just go down here and zoom in a little bit and make it more like a square and I'm going to then head back up here under the model tab make sure that move is unchecked so that I can finally rescale this part to be much thinner like this and finally I'm going to head to the properties Tab and under brick color I'm going to choose a red color there we go we've got our button let's also add some text on top of this button to explain what the button will purchase so let's right click on our part select insert object and then we can search for a billboard GUI click on it to insert the billboard GUI and if you have a look in the Explorer panel you will see it's been inserted inside our part if we select the billboard GUI let's head down to the properties window and under the scale property let's set this to 4 comma 0 comma two comma zero this will just set the size of our billboard GUI and then we just want it to appear around two studs above the part so we can change the studs offset World space property to zero comma two comma zero which will put it two studs above the button if you press enter you can see we've got this blue outline and that's where our text is going to go you can also in the properties panel just set the always on top property to be checked this will make sure it doesn't get covered up by any other parts so let's head back here and in the Explorer panel we're going to click on this little plus next to our billboard GUI and let's insert a text label now if we just pop back out here you can see we've got some text appearing on our screen let's just go back to the text label and select it in the Explorer and then we'll head down to the properties window and we're going to set the size of this button to 1 comma 0 comma 1 comma zero this is going to make the text label fill the entire space in our billboard GUI just like that if we head back to the properties window and scroll down we can check the text scaled box what this is going to do is make the text fill the entire width and height of our billboard GUI and then we can just scroll up here set the background transparency of the button to one of the label sorry that's going to make the background disappear and we can scroll down again and we can set the font face of our text I'm going to choose verdoka1 and then going to set the text color 3 to be a solid white so I'm just going to drag this all the way up here click OK and you can set some text if you'd like I'm just going to leave it at label for now because we will change this using a script so we've got the text for our button and if you'd like you can customize it even more by inserting into the text label a UI stroke that's going to give it an outline which you can see here is a thin black outline but in the properties panel you can change the color if you'd like I could set it to a red and I could change the thickness Etc so that will do for now so we've got our button and we've got our Tycoon all that's left to do is now do some scripting to make our Tycoon work now just to avoid this clipping issue at the sides of our label we can head back to our text label up here and then in the properties panel we can just change the size to 0.9 comma 0 comma 0.9 comma zero that will just give us some padding at the sides and we can also just change the thickness of the stroke like that and whilst we're at it let's just do some quick organization to clean up our Explorer I'm going to start off by in the workspace clicking on this plus icon and inserting a folder I'm going to call this folder tycoons this is just going to be where all of the tycoons in the game are going to be stored because there's going to be multiple players in our game then I'm going to insert a model and this is going to contain each Tycoon so I'm going to rename this model Tycoon and inside every Tycoon we're going to have a few more folders so I'm going to insert a folder and I'm going to rename this to be called buttons that's where all the buttons will go and then go into right click select duplicate to create another folder I'm going to rename this one as decoration and then we're going to right click duplicate once more and rename this one to be called items so we will store the buttons in this one any decorative items such as the walls of our tycoon or the floor in the decorations folder and any items that will be purchased will go into the items folder now let's take all of our parts here except for the button so we'll just select these four here for our walls and our flooring we'll put them into the decoration folder we'll take our part over here which is our Button as you can see I'm just going to rename this down in the properties window or you can right click and select rename it's going to call it button and I'm going to put this inside our buttons folder there we go that's way more neat and organized now I'm going to show you how to add some items that you can purchase in your Tycoon now I'm going to insert a conveyor that's a typical item that you use in a tycoon but it's up to you which items you add you don't have to add a conveyor I'm just trying to show you how the process works so I'm going to go to the toolbox which is a collection of models that we can use so go to the Home tab and select toolbox and then you can search for a model under the model section and I've just searched for a conveyor this one looks quite good so I'm just going to take it and drag it into the world now be careful because some conveyors can have scripts inside of them which is okay just click on the OK button here but just make sure you check them because some can have some dangerous scripts which are in there to cause trouble this one however looks good Okay so we've got our conveyor and I'm just going to select the model of this conveyor over here and you're going to right click and rename it as conveyor now what we need to do is we need to set some attributes and attribute is a little bit like a property it's just a way to store some information about a specific item and in a tycoon we're going to need to save the contents of our Tycoon at some point so rather than doing this by saying there's a conveyor here and there's a conveyor there we can just give every single item an ID and then we can store information about what items a players unlocked in their Tycoon by just listing off the IDS for every single item because if every item has an ID it will just make it really simple to track so let's give our conveyor some attributes for the ID as well as that we're going to want to have a cost attribute a price attribute so that the game knows how much each item is going to cost so down in the properties tab when you have your conveyor selected as you can see in the corner here there it is we're going to go to the attribute section I'm going to click on ADD attribute now a popup will appear down here and we're going to set it to be a number and we'll just call it cost to begin with okay and we'll do the same thing again add attribute the popup will appear we'll set the type to be a number and this one will be called ID so we've now got our attributes these are just custom properties so let's set the cost of this of this conveyor to be 50 for example you can change this to whatever you'd like and the ID will just set that to be number one so the next item we add to the game we'll just set the ID to be two we don't want any items to have the same ID every single ID attribute will need to be unique for every single item this is how we'll be able to uniquely identify and distinguish between them so now we've done that what we're going to do is we're going to take this conveyor and we're just going to store it temporarily in the replicated storage but before we do that let's just position it where we'd like it to go in our Tycoon so I'm just going to drag it and I'm going to put it about here now I can see that the conveyor is a little bit too big and that's fine I'm just going to move my walls over slightly and just resize everything and once I've done that and it's all in the correct position where I'd like it to go I'm just going to move the button over here as well there it is and finally I'm going to right click on my conveyor choose copy and then in the Explorer window we're just going to create a folder in the replicated storage and we're going to name this folder items and then I'm just going to right click and select paste into that's going to create a clone of our conveyor and store it in the replicated storage so what we're doing here is we're having a conveyor stored in our Tycoon so we can actually take this conveyor that's in the workspace and now drag it into our items folder this is just going to be our way of telling the game where we want the conveyor to be positioned and then what we're going to do is when we start the game we're going to strip out all of these items from the Tycoon and when the player buys the item we will then bring it back by creating a clone of it from the replicated storage so this uh conveyor that's in the workspace is just here so that we can position all of our items where we want them to be and then when the game starts up we'll delete these items until the player unlocks them that may be a little bit confusing but don't worry it will all make sense when we see it happening with code later on so everything is now all set up and all that we can now do is write some code so what we'll do is back in the Explorer here let's click on the plus next to the server script service this is where all of our code is going to be stored so click on that plus and just search for a script and make sure whoops I've inserted the wrong script make sure that you insert a normal script okay a gray script now inside of this script we're going to write quite a few lines of code I'm just going to hide this one here so in this script this is the script editor it's where we write all of our code we're going to write some code which will detect when a new player joins the game we'll assign a tycoon to them we will set up all of the buttons and handle the logic for when they step on a button we will handle the currencies so the player will be able to deduct cash when they step on a button and will also handle the positioning of items in the Tycoon as well when you step on a button so to start with let's write some code that will set up a leader stats and some cash for a player when they first join so here we're saying game.players dot player added colon connect function player and this is going to trigger every single time a new player joins and when they do join we want to set up some leader stats so they appear on the leaderboard so we can say local leader stats equals instance dot new we're going to create a folder and within this folder well firstly let's just give this folder a name and we can call it leader stats and we can parent that to go inside the player's object so we've now got a leader stats folder and any uh values that goes inside this folder will appear on the ingame leaderboard so we want the player to have some cash so we can say local cache equals instance dot new into value and cache dot name equals cache and I'm just going to change this to speech marks just to be consistent rather than quotation marks there we go cash dot parent equals leader stats and I'm going to set the player's cache to be 500 when they first join the game we'll handle data saving probably in another video for now this is good to go so if you click on the play button in the script editor up here you should see that when the player joins the game they have some leader stats all right there they are you can see we're now appearing on the leaderboard with our leader stats and if we were to head into the players you can see we've got this folder with our leader stats so that's what we've just set up using Code when a new player joins this folder gets added to their player next we want to be able to assign a tycoon to a specific player we've only got one Tycoon at the moment but you know what we could do is we could just take our Tycoon up here in the Explorer right click it duplicate it and move it across over here so we've now got two tycoons okay we could do that and have a third Tycoon doesn't matter we can have loads of tycoons but out of all of these tycoons which one are we going to assign to a player well that's what we're going to work on now but before that we just need to set up a few more attributes because we need to store information about who owns a specific Tycoon so if we head back to the Explorer panel and just select all of our four tycoons at the moment and then head down to the properties panel let's select add attribute and we want a Boolean value which is a true or false value I'm going to call that taken so that will let us know whether the plot is being used by someone or whether it's vacant and we can use it so we'll then add another attribute and this one is going to be the user ID of the person who owns this Tycoon so this is going to be a number and we'll just call it user ID with a capital u for user and a capital I for ID so now all of our tycoons will have these attributes and we can now check those attributes using code and also set them when a new player joins the game so back in our script let's create a function which will assign a tycoon to a player so we're just going to create a local function call it assigned Tycoon and we're going to take a parameter on argument sorry of the player who has called this function so we'll call this function from the player added event down here and what we want to do is we just want to Loop through all the tycoons in the game that are in the tycoons folder so we can say four underscore comma tycoon in game dot workspace in fact let's create a variable for our tycoons folder so we can say local tycoons equals game dot workspace wait for child tycoons okay and so for underscore comma tycoon in tycoons colon get children so this is going to return a table of all of the tycoons within this folder and then we're going to Loop through each individual Tycoon and just check to see if that taken value is false and if it is false then we know that this is a tycoon that is not currently being used so we can say if Tycoon colon gets attribute taken then continue end because this will just check to see if it is true so if this is true then this if statement is going to resolve and by saying continue we can just skip to the next Tycoon because we know that this one will be taken so this is just a check to make sure whether the Tycoon is free or not so then if the code doesn't continue and it just carries on to the next line we'll know that this Tycoon is free so we can say Tycoon colon set attribute taken we'll set that to true and also Tycoon set attributes user ID we're just going to set that to player dot user ID so we now what we'll also do is because we found our Tycoon we can just say return Tycoon which will break out of our for Loop and stop this function because we no longer need to keep it running and we can also return nil just in case no tycoons get found it will just break out of this for Loop and return nil so that we won't continue any further because there's obviously some sort of error that's occurred for there not to be enough tycoons available so now back down here with our player added function we can create a variable for the Tycoon which we're going to give to our player so we can say local Tycoon equals sign Tycoon and we can pass the player through there as our parameter and what this will do is because we're returning the Tycoon once we have found a plot for them the Tycoon variable will become the Tycoon object which will be in the Explorer so one of these tycoons will get returned to this variable and we'll be able to reference that Tycoon model as a variable and in case there's an error and for some reason we can't give them a tycoon because it's none available and we return nil we'll just do a quick check to say if not Tycoon then warn could not assign Tycoon to dot dot player dot name and we can just say return end so that will print out into the output an error message in case the Tycoon isn't available but what we've just done is we've created a script to find an available Tycoon and assign it to our player so if we now click on the play button up here in the script menu we should join the game and we should have been assigned a tycoon if we just go to the Explorer and we have a look in here in our tycoons folder we'll just pick a random one probably the first one and you can see the attribute of Taken has been checked and the user ID is indeed my user id here and just to prove if I select another Tycoon the second one for example you can see it is not taken and there's no user ID so it's picked one Tycoon to be mine and it set the attributes to my user ID and it's set its taken value to be true now what we've got to do next is set up our buttons so that when we step on them it unlocks the items we'll also need to set up the Billboards for the buttons we'll also have to clean up the Tycoon when the player leaves but aside from that that's all we're going to have to do in order to create a functioning Tycoon and that will be in the next video which will be linked in the card or in the description so I'll see you there don't forget to subscribe and like the video if you found this useful and I'll see you next time
