today I'm going to show you how you can create your own Easter egg hunt game in roblox so you can collect eggs and then a nice popup will come on the screen telling you when you've collected one and the eggs will save as well so let's get started so if you've not done any roblox game development before then my name is Arvind blocks I have lots of videos teaching you how to make your own roblox games and even how to make Road books from them so if you're interested in that then please do subscribe and click the like button so that I know you want more videos from me and also you won't miss out on a future upload so if you haven't ever installed roblox studio all you need to do is go to your web browser and go to roblox comm forward slash creates I'll also leave a link in the description but once you're there click on start creating and then that will let you install a roblox studio roblox studio is the tool used to develop games on the platform once you've got roblox studio you should just be able to go and open it up on your computer by searching for it I'm gonna go and open it up by clicking on the Start menu and clicking roblox here when it opens up you may be prompted to login we go roblox account so make sure you go ahead and do that but once you finish doing that you should see this screen here and if you don't just click on the new button here and these templates should pop up now we're going to click on baseplates and this will open a blank workspace for us to start creating firstly I'm going to save the place by pressing ctrl s or command s and now we're good to go so the first thing I'm going to do is open up the workspace and if you don't see these tabs by the way you just need to go to view and make sure that Explorer and properties are selected we don't need the output for now ok so we're gonna go to the workspace select the base plate and I'm going to just change it to some grass and I'm going to make it green as well so it's a nice to work with next we're going to create our egg so to do this we firstly need to get an egg mesh to do that I'm gonna head to the toolbox and I'm going to search for egg now the toolbox contains lots of different objects created by other people and I'm just going to insert the first egg mesh that I see so just drag it into your game and select and then press F so you can find it my mind seems to be away from the baseplate so I'm going to click and drag it all the way over there and I'm gonna press F to head to the base plate so we've got our egg in here now I will leave a link to an egg mesh model that you can take used to take it and then go to the tool box click on this icon here and then you go to my models and you'll be able to insert it from there if you have bought it it will be free and I'll leave it in description now the next thing to do is just to check that there's no meshes inside of your egg now if there is what we need to do is we need to insert a mesh part okay because what we're going to do is this is actually a part with a mesh inside of it and the mesh makes it look like look make the part look like an egg but there's a natural mesh part which we should be using in roblox so we're going to right click go insert objects and we're gonna type in mesh parts okay now this is our new mesh part but what we're gonna do we're gonna go into the mesh of our egg over here I'm gonna copy the mesh ID okay or cut it and don't worry if the mesh goes away we're gonna paste that much ID into the mesh part and now we've got a part without a mesh inside of it that is an egg okay so that is our new mesh part if you always be using mesh parts instead of of parts with a mesh inside of it okay so we can now delete the egg mesh and don't worry about that if you've taken the model from the description because it will automatically be a mesh part I will have already converted it for you so now that you've got your egg mesh part I'm gonna give it a name and I'm gonna call this one rainbow egg okay so now you're free to make as many eggs as you would like but if you want to give it a you want to color the AIRC or maybe you have a pattern on it well you need to insert a decal onto the egg okay with it you can either texture it or add a decal now texturing is a little bit more complicated so I'm going to show you how you can use decals so we're gonna go to the toolbox I'm gonna click on the market place I'm gonna click on images okay so now you can choose any of these images and you put them onto your egg so I could select let's have a look we're gonna search for rainbow and it's going to give us some rainbow pictures so I could take this one just click it and then hover over the face of the egg so you have to apply a decal to each face so keep clicking for each face of the egg so left right up down front back bottom etc and you have to apply to each surface like this and when you've done that you've now got a patterned egg you've got those decals on it and if we open up the egg we can see we've got the decals in there so that is our egg now if you wanted to texture it okay you'd have to firstly just remove these decals but you would right click and click on copy assets ID and then wear the rainbow egg is set the texture ID to that ID okay and that is texturing it's a little bit different it's as if you just wrap it's like you've wrapped it up in wrapping paper okay whereas this one is kind of like you've just stuck sheets of paper on to each side okay but you can't really see the difference so you can either put decals on it or tech strip now I'm going to get rid of the texture for this one now you can create as many eggs as you like so I'm not going to create anymore so what you now need to do is when you've finished creating your egg we're going to go into a replicated storage here and we're gonna click on the plus and we're gonna insert a folder I'm gonna call this folder eggs okay this is where we're just going to keep all of our eggs in storage because we want to spawn them in we don't want altered we don't we don't want them all to be appearing at once so we're gonna keep them in replicated storage so we're just gonna drag the egg into that folder okay so there we go and remember you can create as many eggs as you'd like next we're going to create the GUI which will appear on the screen when you pick up the egg okay to tell you that congratulations you found it now if you're a channel member on my channel you will be able to access this GUI I will leave it for you channel members so if you do want to get the GUI then you can click the join button underneath the video and you'll Lockette instantly however if you aren't a channel member you can watch along and create it whilst I am so we're going to click on the start to GUI and we're going to insert a screen to your eye then we're going to name this screen GUI we're going to go to the properties and change its name to main GUI okay then inside of there we're going to insert a frame and a frame it just contains some GUI objects okay and it appeared here on the screen now we're going to set the anchor point of this frame to not 0.5 , not 0.5 and what that does is when we set it you'll see in a minute we're also just going to set the position to naught point 5 comma 0 comma naught point 5 comma 0 and that will put it in the exact middle of the screen because the anchor point is that dot in the middle and the anchor point is where the position is taken from and when it's in the middle we are it's definitely in the true middle of the screen then we're going to set the size of the GUI now I'm going to set it to naught point 2 5 comma 0 naught point 3 comma 0 so it's going to take up around that last so that's a good size I think then we're going to change the style property to drop shadow and this will make it a little more professional I do like this style now inside of this frame we're going to insert quite a few things we're going to insert a text label to begin with and this is going to say congratulations so we can click on the text label and I'm going to change its name to congrats and I'm going to set the text to say congratulations and then going to set the text scaled property to be true so that it fills the entire text label box and the size will be set to 1 comma 0 so it fills up the entire of the x axis and then naught point 1 5 comma 0 so it only takes about 15% of the y axis so the y axis being the entire size of this frame so I'm then going to set the background transparency to 1 so you don't have that white background I'm gonna scroll down and set the textcolor three two white again I'm gonna drag that slider all the way to the top now that I've done that I can set the font if I like now I'm going to set this font to be Gotham bold and that's just going to make it look much cleaner much nicer now I'm gonna insert another text label and that's just going to go underneath it so I can insert all I can duplicate this one so right click and duplicate and I'll create an exact copy I'm going to change the name of this new text label to be called you found just gonna say underneath you found and then we'll have the name of the egg so I'm going to set the size to be a little bit smaller than the congratulations on the yaxis I'm gonna set it to naught point one so it'll only take out 10% of the frame size whereas congratulations currently takes about 15% I'm gonna set the position to be nor 0.15 on the yaxis so if we're doing the whole four values it would be zero comma zero because we don't want to move it anywhere on the xaxis because they're currently filling up the entire xaxis on the size property comma not 0.15 comma zero so it's taking up well it's going to be 15% of the way down just where this congratulations finishes off then I'm going to change the text to say you found and then we will change that text with a script when we find a an egg and once we've got that we're going to insert a viewport frame and the viewport frame will have the image of the egg which we find so I'm going to just click on the frame again gonna click on write actually gonna have to search for it search for a viewport frame so a viewport frame can render 3d objects and the GUI if you're wondering what that is again I'm going to set the anchor points to naught to 0.5 common or 0.5 and this again puts that little dots in the middle so it will position it in a true middle because we're positioning it from the middle of the GUI and the position value we'll get to that in a minute I'm just going to do the size so I'm going to get set the size it's going to be quite a precise value but I've tested it not 0.375 comma zero comma not point five seven five come zero if a little bit confused about these GUI size values don't worry and what they're telling us is how much of the frame we are going to take up with this GUI on the x and y axis okay and so the numbers go from 0 to 1 we can pick a number between 0 and 1 for our first and third values there the scale values and it's the exact same with the position so we can set the position of where we want the GUI to to be so I'm going to set it to nor point 5 on the xaxis comma 0 we're not dealing with offset offset is the second value but we're dealing with scale so do need to worry about that and so when it's not 0.5 it will be in there in the middle of the axis so on in the middle for the x axis but we also want it to be in the middle but a little bit further down because we don't it to be touching the congratulations and you found text labels so we're going to set the yaxis position to north point 5 7 5 comma 0 okay and that's going to put it in a nice position here so the final thing that we now need to do is create a button which we can click to hide this GUI when we find something so I'm going to insert a text button now I'm going to call it this text button okay it's going to be an OK button and what I'm going to do is I'm going to set these size to not 0.25 comma 0 so that should take up 25% of the of the X size of the frame so naught point 2 5 comma 0 and then on the yaxis I only want it to take up 10% so naught point 1 comma 0 ok and there we go there's our button so I'm gonna then set text scale to be true so that the text fields will be entire button I'm going to change the text to say ok in fact let's do that in capital letters there we go I'm going to set the font to I'm gonna leave its or sums and let's have a look I'm gonna then move this down on time I'm going to put it firstly it's gonna be in the middle of the xaxis so naught point 5 comma 0 and then for the y axis by the way there's two values per axis which is why we're leaving out the zeros and then for the y axis the scare is going to be naught point nine four comma zero okay because that's gonna be 94 percent of the way down then we're gonna set the anchor point to be naught point 5 comma naught point 5 and that will put it in the true middle of the screen okay there we go awesome so now we have created that GUI which will show the egg when we find it last touches I'm just going to set the background transparency of the viewport frame to be 1 because we don't want that white background I'm also going to change the background color of 3 of the ok button to be green like this and I'm going to set border size pixel to zero so that there's no border on the GUI button okay so there we go now that we're finished with that I'm going to hide the GUI so I'm gonna click on the frame I'm gonna go to the properties window I'm gonna set visible to false because we don't need to show this to you i right now we only want to show the GUI when we step on an egg so how are we going to make that appear when we do step on the egg well keep watching what we're gonna work on now is spawning the eggs so we want to make them appear somewhere in the game so to do that we firstly need to create a folder in the workspace okay so we're gonna click on the plus here and click on folder now this folder is going to contain lots of different parts and each part is going to be a position where the X could spawn because we don't want them spawning in the same place all the time so we're gonna have to have lots of different places where they could spawn and we're going to tell the game where we want to spawn by putting some parts in certain areas of the base plate ok and then using a script we can pick a random part out of this folder and set the position of our egg to the position of that part so we're going to change the name of this folder to be egg spawns it's gonna contain all of the spawns whether whether I could spawn okay then I'm gonna click on the park button it's going to insert a part into the game now I'm going to change the size of this part in the properties window to be one by one by one so that it's nice and small I'm going to set the anchored properties be true I'm going to make sure that can collide is set to false so that you can't step on it you would just walk straight through it you can't collide with it an anchored means that it won't move so it will just stay fixed in that position throughout the entire game so it can't get pushed around and then I'm going to move it wherever I want it to be so we could have a spawn over here but then I just to make sure that I put it inside of the egg spawns folder okay make sure it's in that folder by just dragging dragging it in there I'm also going to change the name of the part to spawn so we know what it is and then because we're gonna want quite a few spawns different random locations where the egg could go I'm going to just keep on duplicating this part so you can press ctrl D to duplicate it or command D if you're on a Mac okay and then a duplicate one has been spawned in the exact same location just drag it away okay so just keep on duplicating by pressing ctrl D or command D and dragging them in random places around the map put them wherever you like on the map okay and if you're finding it a little bit hard to select them you can press ctrl 2 or command 2 or alternatively you can click on the move button over here and then you can move them using these axes here which just makes it a little bit easier okay so I've just placed a lot of them around the map so these are going to be all of the places where the X could spawn now make sure that you've got quite a few of these because we do want them to be random and also make sure that you are putting them on the ground okay don't put them in the air because we're going to script them so that the eggs fall from the sky so just put these parts on the ground okay and make sure that they are in the egg spawns folder and it's also critical that all of these parts are set so that anchored is true or checked and the can collide is not checked okay once you've done that we're going to right click on export and click on selected children this should select all of these parts that we've just created again make sure that they're in the export folder then we're going to set their transparency value to 1 so that we can't see them they're invisible but they're still there so what we're going to do is we're going to write some code which we'll randomly selects apart from this folder so for example this one and then we're going to clone our egg a random egg out of our eggs fold it in a replicated storage and we're going to position it to be 10 studs higher from that brick so it's going to fall down into this position and then our egg is there and able to be collected so I'm going to deselect that part and just close our xforms folder and now I'm going to insert a script into service script service this is where we're going to keep our code so make sure you click on the plus and click on script and again all code from this project will be available to my channel members my premium channel members if you would like to become a channel member you can click on the join button below the video next to the subscribe button or if not you can just follow along and learn as we go along so I'm going to name this script egg spawns okay just so that we know what it does and we're going to firstly create a variable for the folder for our eggs in replicated storage so we say local eggs and then we're going to set that to be equal to game dot replicated storage and then we can say dot eggs okay and then we can say local spawns we're gonna do the exact same but for the egg spawns folder in the workspace equals game dot workspace got eggs forms okay so we've got our two folders here then every two seconds what we're going to do so every two seconds we want to choose a random egg and spawn and put the egg other location so we're gonna want to repeat the code every two seconds forever so for that we can do a while loop so we can say while wait and then in the brackets we put two for two seconds do and drop a line so anything inside of these two lines here anything inside of here so here we'll keep on running and it will repeat every two seconds so every two seconds a new egg is going to spawn so what we need to do is we need to create a table for all of the eggs that are in this folder so currently there's only one but if you had five or six or maybe even fifty we'd want to have a list of all of them and a table is basically a list a list of all the objects in that folder so we're gonna create another variable and a variable just hold some data for us to write to keep on referencing and using later on we're gonna create that variable for the four eggs table okay so eggs table you cause and then a quick way of getting a list of all of the items inside of that folder is firstly getting the folder which we've currently got through this variable called eggs and because they curl on get children with a pair of brackets or parentheses on the end and that will return to us a list of all of the eggs in that folder we're going to do a random pick now so it picks a random egg out of that table so we can say local random egg equals eggs table so we want to pick an item out of that table and to do that we use the square bracket so a pair of square brackets and then inside of these square brackets we need to have a number okay so a random number and that a random number will be between 1 and however many items there are in that table so if there were 5 eggs it would be 1 and 5 so we say math dot random and then in these brackets 1 comma and then hash tag eggs table when we do hash tag eggs table that will give us the amount of items in that table so if there's 50 then hash tag eggs table is going to be 50 so what this code does is it chooses a random egg from that table so currently it would always pick the random egg because it's the only one there but if you have more it would choose around the Mac then we're gonna do the same thing and we're gonna choose a random spawn so local spawns table equals spawns so those spawns in the workspace when we say it's get children it's going to create a list of all of those spawns in that folder and then we can pick a random spawn so local random spawn equals spawns table and then we're picking a random spawn from that table by using math or andum which generates a random number between 1 and I however many spawns there are so if there's 50 spawns it will give us a random number out of all of those spawns it'll give us a random spawn now that we've got our random egg we need to make a clone of it because we're not going to use the egg that's stored in replicated storage we're gonna create a clone of it so local egg clone equals a random egg Curlin clone and that will make a duplicate of it just like when we press control D or command D on the bored it made a clone of it we can then put that clone into the workspace so we're gonna create another folder in the workspace I'm going to call this folder spawned X so it's where all of the X that have spawned are going to go so we can say egg clone parent equals game dot workspace not spawned eggs okay so we've now put that egg into the workspace now let's set its position so we can say egg clone dots position equals now this is a little bit more advanced what I'm going to do is we're going to get the position of the random spawn that we just found so random spawn position and then to make it go into the air we're going to have to add 20 studs to its current Y position so why isn't the up and down position value and then we're gonna add on vector 3 new 0 comma 20 comma 0 ok so we are only adding 20 studs in the y axis so which is why the other values for x and z are 0 so that's going to put it 20 studs in the air above where it currently is now that we've set its position we can say egg clone anchored equals false and when it's been anchored it will fall to the ground so it will just fall from the sky into the ground how awesome is that if you go and play the game now you should see the eggs start falling from the sky into random locations so there we go we've just created our egg spawner but what if you want the egg when we touch it to make the GUI pop up telling us that we found it let's work on that next so the next thing to do is create a simple touched event and a touched event will fire some code when apart what in this case the egg has been touched so we're gonna say egg clone because that is the egg that will be in the game dot touch colon connect and then in these brackets we're going to write function with another pair of brackets and then drop a line and we'll have a closing bracket like this okay so when the egg is touched we're going to run a function and a function just contains some code which is what we're going to do here we're going to contain the code that we want to run when you step on the XO when you step on the egg we want to delete it but we also want to make the GUI appear so firstly we've got an argument here called hit and hit is going to be the object which touches the egg obviously we don't know what it is right now so we use hit as a placeholder for the part that touched it now hit is going to be a body part of your character so we need to check whether that part is an actual body part whether it's another part in the game maybe it switched another egg by accident we don't want it to run if it's not touched a player so we need to firstly check if it's a player by saying game dot players curl on gets player from character hits dot parents now if hit dot parent is a player's character model which it should be then this piece of code here is going to just check whether it is and it's going to return true or false so player or PLR is going to be true or false so if PLR is true then so if it is a player you can actually just say if player and that's a short way of doing it so if it is an actual player then we're going to make the GUI appear on this screen okay so to do that we're going to need to use remote events so I'm going to click on a replicated storage and insert the remote event I'm going to call this remote events found egg and then what we can do is we can say game replicated storage dot found egg curl on fire clients okay and then in these brackets we need to put the PLR when we say fire client we are basically sending a request to a certain player to do something on their end now because it's a GUI and the GUI is actually are stored on the player in their computer we need to send a message from the game to their player to make the GUI appear so we can fire this a remote event to that player we then need to write some code in the GUI to pick up that event and make the GUI appear okay so we're also going to then send some data with it so the piece of data that we're going to send is the eggs name so egg clone dot name because we need to tell the player which they picked up okay so once we've done this we can delete the egg so we can say egg clone curl on destroy and that will just remove the egg from the game because once they found it we just want to delete it next and the final thing for today's video we're going to go into that main GUI and insert a local script so that we can pick up this remote event I'm going to set the name of this script to be clients and inside of this local script we are firstly going to create a few variables so local GUI is going to be script parent that's just going to be the GUI object the frame is going to be the this one here the frame that's inside of the GUI so we say GUI Curlin wait for child frame just to make sure that it has loaded and we're ready to continue we don't want to continue the script before the frame and other things have loaded so we need to make sure they're fully loaded first so we've got the frame the okay button and the viewport frame these are the shortcuts they make it easier for us to quickly get the GUI element instead of having to always say script parent but frame dot viewport frame etc so once we've got our variables we can then create a remote an event that will pick up whenever that found egg is triggered or you know fired for our client so game dat workspace got found egged on client events connects function and then inside of these brackets we're going to have the data that was sent and we don't put the player because that automatically gets sent we're going to have the egg name as an arguments here an argument is the data that gets sent from the server to from the server scripts to our GUI local scripts here so what we need to do is we need to actually firstly check to see if the egg is a real egg and it's actually in certain replicated storage so we can say if game don't replicate the storage got eggs cut I'll find first child egg name because there could be a mistake and the egg might not be there for some reason so if it is there then what we can do is create a clone of that egg so we can say local egg clone equals game or replicate the storage eggs and then in square brackets we can say egg name we don't need to use equity wait for child anymore we we are certain that it's there if we didn't use wait for child in the if statement and there was no egg it would cause an error so it's kind of like a failsafe so it won't break the script if it isn't there so we're then cloning the egg from the replicated storage and we're going to parent it inside of the viewport frame so egg clone dot parent equals vpf for viewport frame when we want to show a 3d object in the GUI likeliest viewport frame I like this egg which which we want to show in the viewport frame any objects you do want to show has to go inside the viewport frame so that's why we've put the egg in the viewport frame then we're going to set the text of the you found text label so frame dots you found got text equals then we'll do a string and say you found then a space then a dot dot because we now need to put the name of the egg so you can say egg named dot dot and then some strings again a exclamation mark and the dot dots is a way of putting some data with a string okay so the egg name which we don't know we can put a dot dot and concatenate it together and that will make it appear in the GUI and the last thing to do is to create a camera in the viewport frame and the camera is the thing that will render whatever goes in the viewport so that we can actually see it so local camera equals instance dot new camera and the camera tells the viewport frame what we should be looking at so we can actually see the egg so camera dot parent needs to put it in the viewport frame and we need to set the viewport frames current camera property because the viewport frame has a property called current camera we need to set that to the camera and then we can set the cameras see frame so what it's looking at to be the egg clones see frame see frame is like a position value but it has the rotation element as well so it tells you how an object should be positioned and rotated so we're telling the camera to look at the egg but we need it to be a few studs away from it because if it was in the middle of the egg we wouldn't be able to see it anything could be inside of it so we are multiplying it by the eggs size on the zaxis x 1.5 okay and that just positions the camera away from the egg so that we can see it so that should be good to go I think I think the last thing to do is just to set the frame the frames visible property to true and also to clear the viewport frame of any children in it so vpf curl on clear all children because if we found another egg we would have the previous egg still stored in the viewport frame so we need to destroy it so we're just gonna say viewport frame clear all children and it will remove anything currently inside of it before we add the new egg okay so let's go ahead and test this out in fact there's one last thing that we need to add and that is a quick little mouse button one event so okay got mouse button one click curl on connect function and this is going to set the frame visible to false so that when we click the ok' button it will set the frames visibility's false so the GUI is hidden so it's kind of like a close button okay so now let's test the game out and see what happens so we're gonna have to walk up to one of our eggs and hopefully this does work first time let's walk up to the egg and there we go congratulations you found rainbow egg and when we click OK the GUI disappears how awesome is that so that was the first video in the egg hunt series if you're enjoying it please do subscribe to my channel because I do loads more videos teaching you how to make roblox games and robots from them don't forget to like the video as well so that I know you like it and I'll probably do some more videos I'm going to show you how you can save a player's eggs so that when they leave the game and rejoin they'll still be there and also also in the future I will probably be making a GUI that shows you all of the eggs that you've got and the ones that you've still yet to find so make sure you subscribe for that and I'll see you in the next video thank you for watching and I'll see you next time Cheers bye
