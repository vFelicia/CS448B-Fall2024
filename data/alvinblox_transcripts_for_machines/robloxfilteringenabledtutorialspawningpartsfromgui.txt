in this video I'm gonna be showing you how to convert a GUI which allows you to spawn parts into the game to nonexperimental mode so that your game can be compatible with filtering enabled let's get started okay so in recent weeks roblox has added a new change which means that nobody can play games which are filtering enabled turned off which means experimental mode on so now developers need to start making their games featuring enabled so I'm gonna start making some videos which shows you how to convert things in your game which probably are broken which or are restricting your game from being non experimental so today what we're going to be looking at is we're going to be converting this GUI right here which allows you to spawn apart we're going to be converting it to filtering and labeled so if we go and play it right now what happens is when I go and click this button it spawns randomly colored parts into the game now this works fine but in a filtering enabled game so if this game had filtering enabled turned on I'd I would only be able to see this change no one else in the game would be able to see it and so the game kind of gets broken so we need to convert this game to filtering enabled so that everyone can see the parts which I spawn in and that no one else can do malicious things to the game so let's go into our local script and I'm just going to show you one of me so I've got a little event here which will run whenever I click the button and it just creates a new part in the workspace and gives it some properties as well describes it a little bit so we want to insert this part into the workspace but we need to do this on the server we can't do it on the client because the server will not replicate any changes made to the rest of the clients so we need to do this change on the server so that everyone else can see the new parts being added because at the moment only I will be able to see this change because I am the person executing the code and the parts are being created on my end so to do this we're going to insert a remote event into applicator storage so let's just go and insert that in now and let's just give it a name cooled parts create okay and I'm just going to want to go into the walk into service script service and put a script in here as well this is where the parts are going to be created and what's going to happen is we're going to make a request to this remote event from the local script and we're going to tell it that we want to insert a part into the game and then this script here on the server is going to listen out for a call to that remote event and when it gets triggered by the local script what's going to happen is the remote event is going to tell the script to execute the code and the code will be to insert a new part so let's go into our script and let's just create our event for when this remote event gets triggered because the local script on the client will be firing off this remote event and the server scripts which is in service script service will be listening out for this request to make the part and then we will be able to make it once once that request has been fired so to do this we're going to say game don't replicated storage and then really get the name remote event which is part create and then we're gonna say dot on server event so when there's been an event on the server when it's been triggered we're gonna say Connect and pair parenthesis and we can say function and another pair inside of here and go and just drop a line so that we've got end and we've got our closing bracket on the end so inside of here any code inside of this events will run when the remote event is fired by the local scripts okay so we're going to have our code to create the part inside of this service script so let's go and just copy this out of the local script into the server script okay there we go and what we're gonna want to do now is head back to our local script because we want to detect when the player clicks the button and then we need to fire the remote event once it's been clicked so inside of this event the activated event when the button is clicked any code inside of this event run what we want to do is we want to fire the remote event okay so you do this it's quite simple we just have to say game dot replicated storage and we're getting the remote event again part to create and then what I want to do is we want to fire code on fire server and what this will do is it will fire off the trigger to anything which is listening out for it so you can have multiple scripts listening out listening out for a call from this remote event and then when there is a server event we've just fired the server event when that does get fired the code inside of here will run and the part will be crated so let's go and give our code a test let's go and run out the game in fact what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and run this in a in a server in a test server so that we can see the game from two different players perspectives and have filtering label turned on as well in workspace and let's go and load up this test server so we've loaded up the game here in a test server and this is what would be like in a real roblox game with filtering enabled turned on so in if filtering enabled was turned off anyone would be able to insert the parts and we wouldn't have needed to do the changes we just made but now now that we have got filtering enable turned on if we hadn't have just made the changes which we just did with the remote event and the sir script the player who clicks the button would only have been able to see the part for themselves but now that we have made this game compatible with filter enabled by using remote events to send the trigger from the local script to the server script which creates the part on the server so that everyone can see it if we click on the button on player 2 who's on the Left player ones on the right if we click the button and we fire it from player 2 player 1 on the right should be able to see the part being added and there it is so you can see the part was added on each player's client or it was added to the server and they got replicated to each client so everyone was able to see it and so now instead of just one person being able to see the change everyone in the server will be able to see and interact with the part which has just been added now let me show you what this would have been like if we just didn't make the changes we just did but if we kept filtering enabled turned on so here we are we're in the same test server again but this time filter enabled is still on but I've just reverted the changes we've just made and the part is being created in the local script or it and that's what it looked like at the start so there's no remote events there's no server scripts controlling any of this the part is being created on the client in that local script so this means that if the player if player two on the Left clicks this button the part will be created for them but for player one and everyone else in the game there's no part there and this is because the part what happened was the the player player two on the left click this button and the client his client his or her client said to the server I want to add a new part into the game and because we've got philtrum enabled on which prevents the client talking to the server and making changes the server said no I'm not going to add this part into your game I'm not so I'm not going to add the part into the server so it will only be added on it'll be it only be visible to you on the client but you could be doing something malicious so I'm gonna block this request so it's only been added to the client who clicked the button okay so it's only on there it's only on their game it's only on their screen because it's it's it's locally on their client however for the other players because what happens when the client makes a change what would usually happen is the change goes to the server and the server replicates that change to all the clients because the server has blocked that request it's not going to be replicated to anyone else so no one else will be able to see the part being added only the player who clicked the button hence why player 2 cannot see it so if we move player 2 over here you can see player 2 he's he's moving you see on player 1 screen so on play a 2 screen on on the left you can see that player 1 on the right he is actually pushing he's pushing the the brick but on the right screen are on player 1 he's not actually pushing anything to him because there's no there's no block there so the illusion is only there for player 2 on the left because it's like the part is locally on their client and only they can see it so that was a little tutorial on how to convert GUI buttons which spawn parts or make changes to parts on the server you have to use remote events if you're calling them from the client so I hope this helped you if it did please leave a like subscribe any if you are having troubles with experimental mode you want to make your game philtrum enabled compatible but you it's something stopping it from happening let me know what you want me to cover next in this series I'm going to be doing lots of videos on how to correct issues which are arising from experimental mode so if something's not working for you because of this new change then do let me know in the comment section below and I will try my hardest to make a video on it so this has been me blocks if you enjoyed the video please like make sure to subscribe to turn on the notification about it's me telling you to scripting you
