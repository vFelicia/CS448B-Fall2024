hello everyone this is Alvin blocks welcome to this scripting tutorial on for loops and tables so the for loop that we're gonna be looking at today is called the in pairs loop whether there is another for loop which we will look at in future videos now a table is something that contains multiple bits of data okay so just like a variable which can hold one piece of data a table can hold multiple pieces of data and we hold them in these squiggly brackets so all of your data will go inside of these two Sewickley brackets when we have those two squiggly brackets or braces we are telling the script that it is a table and you separate each piece of data with a comma so in this table I have got 11 items and each item is a piece of data which is of the number data type it could be any data type it could be a string it could be an object it could be a boolean or a number you can have them all mixed together so you could have a table with numbers strings you know objects all in one table doesn't matter and the order doesn't matter either so you can see I've got them these numbers ordered 1 to 11 although that really doesn't matter you could have 11 at the start and 1 at the end and what does matter is that every item in the table has its own position index so a position index is a way of identifying an object in the table so they start off at 1 so this number here this 11 because it's at the start of the table it will have the position index of 1 this one will have position index 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 as we go along so they all have their own position index values and that's just a way of identifying the things in the table because we might not know the the order of the table but if we want to access a certain piece of data that's in the table we can identify it by its number and it can get a little bit confusing in this example because we have a load of numbers but if I just give you another example here okay great I have just updated the table and you can see we have got a object here we've got a string here we've got a number here and a boolean so we've got four different pieces of data but again they're all going to have position index values separated by that comma so we know that this is the first object so it's going to have position value 1 2 over here 3 over here for if you were to add more then it would just carry on so if you had another you know piece of data here then that would be a 5 and that it would go on for as many items that you have so we it's invisible basically we you know we can't see the position index but we don't need to because we know that it just counts up from 1 from the start so this would be the first one this would be the second one should be a third one etc so how do you access things that are in a table because we've got things in a table right now and that's all well and good but we don't know how to access them so what we can do from a script if we wanted to access them we would have to firstly say the name of the table we would then have to specify its position value its index I'm just gonna call it index from now on because that's what we call it so it's and so the index is basically the the number position of where it isn't in the table so in square brackets we then put that that index value so if I want to get the first item in the table I can say 1 and just like a variable this is now equal to the value at that index so at index 1 is game dat voice basedgod base plate so if we were to so so basically my table 1 is gonna be equal to game that works based on base plate and just to prove that if I was to print this it would print out the it prints out the base plate there we go it prints out base plate so it's name and if you were to change this so 2 2 which is a string it will print out so there we go and if I was to print out three it would print out 50 because that's a number so there you go so this is how we access things that are already in a table so we use the index value but also you can edit a table by adding things to it you can add things to it right now by just adding a comma and adding something new but what if you wanted to add something to a table as the game is going on like when we are when the game is running we can't add something to a table we just can't head into the script and add something because the scripts running we can't edit it when it's running so say if a game is currently happening and we want to add something to a table you may be thinking give me a practical use of a table because why would you want to add something to a table okay so a typical example is you can have a table of players who are currently in the round so let's say you have a hide and seek game and at the start of the round you would have all of the players objects in the table and you don't need to worry about how we we're getting them and adding them in but let's just imagine that we have games got players got Alvin and game got players got Bob and these are the players that are in the round when it begins and let's just have another one in here because one of them will be the seeker so we'll have Allen as well so now what you'll what we want to do is let's imagine that Alvin gets caught so we would want to remove Alvin from the players in round table because he's no longer in the round he's out of this round because he's been caught so we would want to remove him from the table so how do we do that so we can say table dot remove and you can see when we write table there are all sorts of different functions that we can apply to a table so these are all built into roblox we've got remove we've got insert we've got things like saw to con cats pack unpack we're not going to look at those today running a look at table dot insert table dot remove because there are the things that you need to know basically so we can say table dot remove and this is the way of telling the script that we want to remove something from the table so you say table dot remove in a lower case and it should go blue now in these brackets if you just look closely it says okay so the first thing that we're gonna put in these brackets is the actual table that we want to remove something from we need to tell the script which table do we want to be removing from so we want to really removing from the table players in round that's why it's important for the table to be a variable so he can access it later on just like a variable then we do a comma and now it's looking for the number pause now pause is short for position so it's looking for that position index value which we talked about earlier which is how we can uniquely identify a item in a table because what if you had two items in the table that are exactly the same you could have two numbers so you could have two 50s in a table or twogame drop players to Alvin's or two strings are exactly the same how do you differentiate between them well that's what the position index values for beakers even if you have two items in the table with all the same they're gonna have different index values because one's gonna be you know two and then the next one's gonna be three so they're gonna have different values so we put that number in and because Alvin is at position number one we remove the first index from the table and don't go worrying about Oh what if you don't know that their position in the table well it's just an example right now and you know you'll be able to do that when you do more tutorials and you'll know about that but this is just an example so we're removing from the table players in round the first index if you wanted to remove Bob we would do two because his index value is two because he is the second item in the table he wants to remove Allen guess what it's gonna be three because he's the third index in the table but what will happen now is if we just set that back to one for having what's going to happen is the table is going to look up the first index which is Alvin here is gonna completely remove it and we're gonna have two items left in the table my trap so let's just let me just show you this I'm gonna do is I'm going to print the players in round I'm going to print the first player in the round okay now because we don't have the actual players in the game it's going to error so I'm just going to replace them with strings so just imagine that they are objects but obviously we don't have an Alvin Bob and Alan in the game to use so we are using strings for this example so if we print out before we do any removing we've print out the first item in the table then we remove them okay let's have a wait in here so we can see the changes then we're gonna remove Alvin then we're gonna wait again just so that we can see the changes we don't need to wait again actually if we just do a print we're gonna do print players in round one so what should happen is here it should print Alvin because at this moment in time one more on line eight when we were on line eight Alvin is the first index in the table haven't been removed yet then we're gonna remove the first index so Alvin will be gone so then because Alvin's gone then the table shifts and all of the indexes will move so Bob will take the place because he's now the first index so he's gonna have index one although he had index two before his index is now one so he's been shifted to the top of the list right so Alan will now take Bob's index and Alan will have index two so let's just look at this again so if Alvin has position one two and three but then Alvin gets booted off the table then what's gonna happen is everyone else is gonna take their place so Bob here because there's no more Alvin what's gonna happen is you see Bob is now position index one Alan is position index two and while there isn't a position index 3 anymore because we've shifted and there is no longer the no longer three objects in the table so there you go so what should happen is down here it should print Bob so let's run the scripts and see what happens actually we need to just um nevermind we don't actually need to do that I was just a bit too concerned because I thought this with the table with never mind you can see it's printed out Alvin let's run that again so prints out Alvin wait two seconds removes Alvin from the table and then Bob comes along and is now the first index so just as we thought what happened the first index was Alvin but then we kicked out Alvin from the table who removed it and so now we can tell that Alvin was removed because Bob is now the first item in the table because the order has shifted so there you go you can also add things to a table so you could say table dot inserts and you can give the players in round and then the instead of giving the index so instead of saying position two you can give that you so you can say that the position so I want to be inserted at index two John okay so if now what's going to happen is if I was to print out position two here let's just change this so at first Bob should print first because he's currently in position two but if we then add John into the table at position two Bob should shift along because let's just have a look at how this will work let's draw our positions in so one two three let's add a fourth one what's going to happen is when we get to this line here well John is gonna be inserted at position two so sorry Bob but you've got to move along so everyone gets moved on just excuse the drawing for now what happens can you see that John takes Bob's place and Bob moves along to position three so when we print out players in round the second index we should be getting John the second time round so at first its Bob but then inserted into the table comes John and John is now in position two so the positions have shifted just like they shifted when we removed someone they also shift when we add someone but instead of shifting to the left they've shifted to the right because John has come in and taken Bob's place sorry Bob but now John is more powerful than you because he is in position number two but that is what table insert table remove is so very useful if you want to add things to a table so again in the context of this example when somebody gets caught we want to use table dot remove to remove them from the table when somebody joins the game we want to add them to the table or when the round starts we want to add everyone to the table which leads on really nicely to the next video which is going to be for in pairs loops everybody's been asking for this video while guys is coming and I hear you because everybody's thinking oh what what are these for in pairs loops so for IV in pairs you know what's all this good stuff about well we'll be learning about that in the next video because coincides really nicely with tables it's one of those things where you need to know about tables first for you to be able to understand the in pairs loop because really all it is is just manipulating tables at scale with this for loop so see you in that video I hope you enjoyed this one any concerns questions leave a comment I will try and respond and do leave a like do subscribe do share it with your friends if they if you think they will benefit from this free scripting teaching on my youtube channel so don't forget subscribe don't forget to like if you in like if you do like the videos and I'll see you in the next one Cheers bye
