I'm going to show you how to kick a user from your Roblox game so I'm just going to use the player added event to get a player to test this on quickly uh but if you want to kick somebody from your game there's a multitude of reasons why you might want to do this perhaps they're causing trouble they're exploiting being a nuisance and you want to remove them from the server so you would just say player colon kick and then You' give a reason if you want to in strings so you could say you have been banned for whatever all right and you think that's it but if you kick a player usually you want to prevent them from joining the game again you for at least that server so we can create a list of kicked players by creating a table and then we can say table do insert kicked players player. name and then we can check to see if the player who joins is in that table we could say if um table. find uh kicked players and I'm going to change it from player. name to player. user ID just because I prefer that um so if we find them in the table then again we will kick the player and this will make sure that if somebody joins the server gets kicked and later tries to come back they won't be able to return now in your game you will not be kicking a player when they first join this part is just for show um to show how to kick a player you would have this code outside of um this player added event you'd have it somewhere else but you get the idea if you kick a player add them to this table and then you can check to see if they're in the table when they rejoin perhaps you might kick a player from another script and since this kicked players table is in this server script you won't be able to access it from other scripts in that case I recommend you set up a remote event or a bindable event to kick a player and you have the code to uh intercept that event in this script as well okay just make sure you're doing the necessary checks to make sure the player who is attempting to kick someone is actually an admin or someone who is deserving of the authority to kick somebody in your game otherwise uh chaos might ensue anyway thank you for watching let me know if you enjoyed the video subscribe as always and I'll see you in the next one
