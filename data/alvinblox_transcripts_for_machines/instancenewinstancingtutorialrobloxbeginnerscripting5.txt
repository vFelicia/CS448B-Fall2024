hello welcome to the fifth video in my roblox scripting series today we're going to be looking at instancing in the previous video we learned about variables I recommend you go check out before you watch this one else it won't make much sense so we're gonna jump straight in so instancing allows you to insert things into your game from a script now we can insert things such as a part by just clicking on this button or by going to model advanced object and selecting something here but what if you want to insert something at a specific time or you know something that we want to use later on we will use a script for that so let's insert a script into service script service and I'm gonna show you how to insert things from a script so what we're going to do to insert something into the game is we're going to use instance okay so when you say instance that just means like objects in roblox and then we want to say we want to insert and one of these so we say instance don't you okay and you can see here it says create a new object of type Val so Val is going to be the object that we want to insert so we say instance new and then we do a pair of brackets or parentheses and after the new and then inside these brackets we write the name of the objects you want to insert so a full list of the objects you can insert can be found by going to model advanced objects and then you just find the thing you want to insert so we're going to insert a part if we go to P there it is in fact let's just search for a part that's what we're going to insert so you can insert any of those so in speech marks we just write part okay and it auto fills here so once you've done that that will insert the object into your game now if we run here you will see that nothing happens okay and that is because we haven't told the script where we want to put this okay so as I've said before if you want to insert something that can be seen you put it in the workspace as that where everything that we see in the game world gets rendered so we need to tell the script where to put this part so there are two ways to do this the first way is to just put a comma after the name of the thing you want to insert and then you write the path of where you want to put it okay so if I want to put it in workspace I can just say comma game dot workspace and if we run the game this is going to insert the part in the workspace there it is yeah there we go it got inserted so we've told the script to what we want to insert and where it's going to be placed in the workspace but we can't actually give it any more information right now the only things we can tell it is it what its gonna be and where it's gonna go there are the only two things we can pass to an instance got a new function so what if you wanted to give us some properties maybe like you know give it some color maybe change its anchored property we need to change these properties for something we want to instance maybe we want to put it in a certain location change its size etc so to do this we're gonna take this instance new calling of this inbuilt function and we're gonna set it to a variable so let's just say local and we're gonna give our variable a name so we can call it my part you can call it whatever you want and we're gonna make it equal to this instance new because when we call instance new here what it's actually doing is creating this part and basically it's returning the part that was created to this variable so my the the variable my part is now equal to the part which we just inserted now now that we've in now that we've made it a variable we can change the properties of this part so think of my part as just being the part that we just inserted we can now change all of the properties that a part has so we could say for example change its transparency and we could set up to not 0.5 say my part or anchored he comes true okay we could even set its position so I'm not sure if we've covered positioning things yet with vector3 but you can set its position like this and you can put it in a certain place so we could say five five five and that will put it in that location so now if we run the game again and we wait for it to load the part should be crated but it should have these properties assigned to it as well so there we go the part was created it's five studs off the ground in its position as you can see there we go it's also anchored and the transparency is set to more point five so you can change properties of the thing that you insert as long as you make it a variable now last part of this video I told you about this second while actually telling the script where to put this this this objects by using the second argument in this function of games at workspace now this is actually bad practice and you shouldn't tell the script where you want the object to go until you've defined all of these properties because basically it's just less efficient to fool the scripts to put it in the workspace and then change its properties so the best practice is to actually get rid of this and just instance it like that and only provide to the instance function the name of the object that you're going to insert and then once you've applied all of these properties then you can say my parts dot parent equals game dot workspace now you need to tell the scripts where it's going to go else nothing is going to be instance instance well it is but you're not gonna see it because tweak if we get rid of the parent the script has created it but it hasn't actually placed it anywhere so there is no path so where you have to say my part dot parent and we can tell it where we want it to go and that could be anywhere it could be workspace it could be server storage but we're gonna insert it into game data workspace and if we won the game there we go so for best practice put that parent right at the end once you have to find all of your properties so that was how you instant things in roblox studio I hope you like this video it was a short one and I haven't done any of these beginner videos for a while and sorry about that but they will be coming back again soon so if you
