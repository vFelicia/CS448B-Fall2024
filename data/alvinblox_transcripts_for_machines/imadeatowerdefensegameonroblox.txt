okay so last year in january 2020 i created this tower defense simulator game completely from scratch but i didn't do anything with it i was planning to either release it as a game and i was just making it for fun or maybe even as a tutorial and i was kind of just left it to sit in my roblox account doing nothing i thought it would be great to do a video showing how i made this game so you can see how they work and maybe in the future i'll do a tutorial series on how to recreate this so let me show you how the game works let's just go and load in here so if you haven't played tower defense simulator the aim is that you get waves of zombies here and you have to place down fighters to kill them so if i place down my little fighter over here he's going to start shooting the zombies and hopefully the wave will be cleared and if we do let any zombies get over here to our little bank area this is kind of like our our city i guess we don't want them to get over here because our health of our city will start to be destroyed and we'll lose the game so you have to place down these fighters and they will attack the zombies you can see we're already starting to lose a bit of health there so i'm just going to place down a load of fighters because every new wave which appears brings tougher zombies more zombies faster zombies etc so we've got two zombie types in the game they're just default npcs for now but you can definitely customize them you can have all sorts of different maps i've only got one map here and this is basically it this is the game once you get to maybe wave 9 or 10 the zombies will be very fast they'll come in hordes of very very powerful zombies you'll get bosses which eventually you will need a lot of fighters in order to defeat them but the game isn't too advanced i mean you usually in a tower defense game you have to actually pay money to spawn these fighters but i can have as many as i want here so let's just go and spawn a load and i'll come back to you when when i've got a massive army of them all right i'm nearly dead over here so we need to get a load of new units in over here before the next wave of zombies arrive because this is going to be a very powerful wave i think if we let any zombies get to the end here we're going to be dead here we go here come the zombies and yeah they're way too powerful for us and we were defeated game over but you can see how the game works it's working pretty well we've got the the zombies moving along the path and i'm happy with it so let me dive in and show you how this game works so first of all i created my zombies and i put them in this folder and i created a module which uses object oriented programming so i can create a function which spawns a zombie and sets up the zombie with their character gives them a specific name and sets their properties such as their health etc and then what i do is i spawn the zombie and move them to the spawn point which is actually over here now if we have a look at this invisible part you can see i've got my paths here so i've got path one path two a three four five six they're all numbered and each path has a starting node well we have a starting node for this this first path and we have an end node over here so i'm telling those i'm making two positions where you can form a straight line for the zombies to walk on so the zombie is going to spawn over here and they're going to walk to the end node and when they get to this node here they're going to move to this one and then they're going to move to this one so you can see how they they move across the path over here to get to the exit so what we do is we have our enemy module here which spawns a zombie and then we have this move function which loops through all of those paths those numbered paths and it will move the npc the the enemy to the end node's position and then we'll wait until they get to that position and then we'll go again to the next one and eventually when they get over here to the finish line we will detect when they get to the final node and when they do we'll subtract some health off our bases total over here so when they break out of this for loop they must have got to the end of the path so we'll see okay is the base still alive have we still got some health and if we have we're going to damage it by a certain amount that the zombie damages and that's why i decided to use object oriented programming because we can set different damage values for different uh zombies so we could have a dumb zombie which only does 100 damage or you could have a super boss zombie which does a hundred thousand damage and so by saying self dot damage i can access that damage property which is assigned to each individual zombie and if we go over to our other script here you can see in the main script i've actually got a massive dictionary table of the different waves so we've got wave one and in the first wave i'm going to spawn two dumb zombies they're going to have a delay of two seconds in releasing them and they're going to have four walk speed and the damage they're going to give is 250 so each time they get to the end it's going to take 250 off our total but you can see as we progress down to wave 2 wave 3 wave 4 wave five six seven and eight you can see in wave seven they do thirty thousand damage so that's why towards the end of when i was playing the game they were doing more damage to my base and then we have a little event over here which detects when the base's health changes and when that does we just we just will check to see if it's less than zero and if it is then we're going to set a variable to say that the game is over and we can check if it is true when we start the next wave and it will stop that from happening so this is the main game loop so every new wave we're just looping through this massive table of waves here and then we're getting the number of zombies from this table here and then we're going to spawn each individual zombie over here and then we will just wait in this little loop to make sure that there are no zombies left if the enemies have all been defeated then we can move on to the next wave but if they haven't then the game is over but if we get to the end of the waves because we've only got eight waves so once we get to the end of the waves we finish this final one we're going to get to this part of the code and it's going to say if your base health is still above zero then you win the game and we can fire a little event which will show something on the screen to say congratulations you win now let me show you how i made the fighters which you can actually place down using your mouse so firstly i created a database which gives information about all of the different fighters which you can use so i just list them in this table each individual one it has a cost although it doesn't actually take that cost from your balance all of the the fighters are free at the minute but i was going to add that in a future update i didn't get around to it but i just put all of my fighters in here and i have a reference to where they're located in the game so in replicated storage i have all of my fighters in here and then i have a script in the starter gui which actually handles the placing of those fighters so we've got the gui which will load in all of those fighters when the player joins the game when this event is fired and then for each individual fighter when we click the fighter then we will have a mouse connection here which when you move the mouse it finds the c frame of where your mouse is on the floor so you'll get your mouse position and it will just do some calculations here to make sure that the fighter is placed on top of the floor and it will move the fighter around with your mouse and then when you click the mouse it's going to fire off to the server it's going to tell it to place the fighter down and then when the fighter is placed it's going to start attacking the zombies so just like the zombies had their own damage property each individual fighter can do different damage to to counter the zombies and that help to beat them then we've got some code over here which just changes the gui bar at the top every time your health changes and if it's if it's under 75 then it will change to amber if it's under 50 it will go to orange and then obviously if you're low on health under 25 it will turn red and this code here just tweens it and if you lose the game it will say game over here is the object oriented code for the fighters so just like the enemies we create a function which individually will make the fighter and it will assign a level of damage it will create the character and position it and animate it i created an animation which i load into the the fighter so it looks like it's holding the gun and firing the gun and then i have a function which actually attacks an individual enemy so what we'll do is we find the closest zombie to the fighter because we want to attack the one that's closest to that fighter so that's why you've got to be tactical in where you place them you place them near the start then you're going to be attacking the the the zombies as they come out of the spawn so this function here will find the closest enemy to that fighter it will return it and then we have another function which we use to attack it and to damage it and i was actually going to create some more uh functions which find the the most powerful zombie so you could attack just the most powerful one and it's all about tactics so in a tower defense game you've got to be tactical in where you place them and which zombies you decide to attack then we also have some values in replicated storage which i update on the server just so that we can tell the clients the health of the base uh what current wave we're in etc so you can easily access that from guis but that's pretty much it and this is just kind of a great example of why you should use object oriented programming in certain projects not every single project but it allows you to have individual classes for things so you have a class for your fighters and a class for your enemies and you can track individual enemies which you spawn and keep them all in in one place so you know all of the fighters that you have spawned it's just a great way to organize your code so hopefully this gives you an insight into how a tower defense game works and let me know if you want to see a tutorial series on this i can't promise anything but i'll definitely look into making a series on this i know it's a very popular topic so leave a like if you enjoyed it to let me know you want to see that drop a comment if you have any questions or anything you want me to answer and i'll see you in the next video don't forget to subscribe turn on your notification bell and i'll see you in the next video thanks for watching i'll also leave a link to this game as well in the description so you can go check it out for yourself so thanks for watching guys i'll see you next time cheers
