okay in this video I'm going to quickly show you how to use get service so Roblox very powerful has a lot of services um which will give you access to the Roblox API Roblox API is essentially just a massive collection of functions and events uh and things that are created by Roblox which makes game creation a lot easier gives you access to things like data storage um purchasing stuff uh also SS okay so very simple all you say is game so you create a variable for your service and you say game get service and then you give the service name so many services to choose from I recommend you go to the uh object browser and just have a look through here there's so many different services that have different um uh you know different purposes uh such as the ad portal ad service for displaying immersive ads we've got loads of audio Services the main ones really are things like your HTTP Service Marketplace service um data store service but there's so many different ones pathf finding as well uh and they all have these functions they have these events functions which we can uh make use of right so we don't have to code them ourselves a lot of them we wouldn't be able to code ourselves because um you know Roblox is giving us quite a bit of power here so yeah I'll show you a couple of them you've got obviously you've got your um your main ones in the workspace replicated storage server storage script Serv script service they're the main ones really and then you've got things like Marketplace service which lets you um it lets you you know check if a user owns a game pass so user owns Game Pass async you just provide a Game Pass ID and a user ID you've got stuff like a prompt purchase so if you wanted to prompt a user to buy something you'd use it and that's what makes that popup appear which says do you want to buy this for 100 robu that's done using the marketplace service so you can see how these Services let you connect more things to your game it sort of gives it more functionality and this is just a Marketplace service right there's so many more services we've got data store service where if you say um game get service data store service you can do things such as get uh get data store and then you could say get a sync to get someone's data or you could use set a sync to set someone's data so that is the data store service and there's just so many that I can't go through in this video I'm just going to try and go through some of the the main ones that I use especially you've got the tween service for example tween service lets you smoothly animate um parts or guis so you could make it do a nice slow animation let me show you if I create a part over here and I want to slowly make it fade away I could say tween service create game. workspace dopart between info. new and I could say transparency equals one and I could say play uh this is going to make the part Fade Away watch this there it goes it's gone but it's still here because we've tweened it so using these server is just lets you um link up to to The Wider Roblox API and do all these cool things um you know this for example has saved me having to write a for Loop which would very slowly decrease the transparency but it also lets me have loads of properties I could set the easing style you know I could configure whether I want it to um reverse itself or whether I want a delay so so many really cool services and really all you need to do to get them is just say get service and set it as a variable like this and then that variable is it's almost like a table it's just full of all of these different events functions properties um that we can then use so it will be something you're using all the time if you're scripting and making games so just familiarize yourself with some of these Services um you know especially things like user input service um uh obviously the main ones as well like workspace replicated storage I'll probably make another video which explains their purposes but yeah Services really important and I hopefully this video has taught you a thing or two about them so if you enjoyed it let me know uh subscribe like and I'll see you in the next one
