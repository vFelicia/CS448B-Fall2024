okay today we're going to look at how to make objects talk in Roblox and that is by giving them an overhead GUI bubble so we'll just insert a part here and I'm going to run the game just to have this in a live running server and I'm going to show you how to add a chat bubble above the head of this uh part so let's just create a script and have it to the side here you don't have to create this script I'm just going to do it for demonstration first thing you want to do is you want to get a service called chat so game get service chat just like this and then you say chat colon uh where is it I've forgotten what it's called chat I think it might just be chat yeah it's called chat okay so this function of the chat service called chat you supply the specific part which you want the bubble to appear above and then secondly you provide a message like hello and what we'll do is we will just run this script by saying reload script uh reload is that working no it's not working let's put it in the command bar instead down here okay still not working why is that okay I don't know why that wasn't working in run mode it might be because things like text bubbles don't get rendered but if I go into play here and I run this code in the command bar you can see it is inserting chat bubbles now Roblox will say when you try and use this service the chat service that it is technically deprecated which means you're not supposed to use it in new work because it's so old and yes that is true but I don't see a time where they're going to completely get rid of this uh function because it would break a ton of games that use it so use it at your peril I still use it in my games it's completely up to you whether you use it however there is an alternative and that alternative is text chat service display bubble and it does the exact same thing okay we go into play here and we run this code again in the command bar you can hardly tell the difference uh the only real difference I suppose is it uses the new text chat service so if you wanted to you could have a little bit more control over the font the text color whatever um but this is probably the best way to do it because you then have access to more events and things uh such as bubble displayed which will fire when a text bubble appears uh however if you just want to send a message then really it's not going to make much of a difference so that is how you do it for a part and same thing goes with NPCs really there's not much difference we'll just insert a rig of my avatar and uh we'll go back into the script we'll just do a task. we here of about 3 seconds we'll say Gameworks space. rig and that's it really click on play here wait 3 seconds and oh sorry it needs to be a part so we'll just say rig. head and play here and you'll see that my character is not displaying the bubble for some reason let's have a look and see why that might be okay so I did some investig ation and it turns out the main difference between text chat service and chat service is that you can only use text chat service display bubble on the client so if I was to call this from the server you don't see anything and the difference with the normal chat service that we showed you at the start of the video is well let me show you here it works on the server okay I posted a message from the server saying hello from the server and it appears on the clients so this means if you were to send a message from the server using text chat service it wouldn't work because you can only use it on the client so you'd have to use a remote event which opens a complete other uh can of worms because that's a separate issue that you'd probably need to learn however like I say if you just want the easy method use chat service right you use the the chat uh chat that we showed you at the beginning if that doesn't work anymore then you'll have to use a remote event which would look something like this so you insert a remote event we'll just call it chat and we'll say game. replicated storage. chat fire all clients and we'll just put hey from the server and we'll also pass the rig like this and the rig's head sorry and then on the client in a local script you would say game replicated storage do CH on client event connect function part message text chat service display bubble part message like this and we'll just get the text chat service and we'll just do a task. wait 3 seconds on the server to so that we can actually see this going through and there we go so we've been able to send the message from the server a little bit more work there cuz we have to use a remote event uh but there you go that is the difference between chat and text chat Service uh tldr is essentially text chat service is the newer version but it only works on the clients and the the Legacy chat service works on the server you can send messages from the server and it will just appear to all clients now one last thing uh the reason why text chat service it doesn't work on the server uh it's because they want you to make sure that text gets filtered right um if you wanted to send a message from the client to all servers we would have to filter that string on the server so if you're not sending messages from the server for example if you had I know this is getting a little bit confusing and complicated but let's say you wanted players to be able to set messages for NPCs you would firstly have to process that on the server use the filter string async as text filtering service to filter that before you then send it to all the clients um so just something to be aware of there so that is everything you need to know about how to make NPC dialogue if you found it useful please leave a like Please Subscribe and I'll see you in the next video
