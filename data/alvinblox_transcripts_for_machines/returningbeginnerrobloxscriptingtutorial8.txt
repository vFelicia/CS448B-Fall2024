code Alvin blocks when buying premium or roi books let's get straight into the video hello and welcome to the eighth video in my scripting series today we're going to be looking at returning now before you watch this video you're gonna need to know about functions parameters and arguments and I've done videos on those topics in this series already so I'll leave a link in the card or in the description down below so you can go and check those out so returning it allows you to send back data from a function so that it can be used later on so in this example we have a function which adds two numbers together and we've got the parameters number one and number two and we send the arguments three and five to this function and it will calculate the result by adding them together so we're calling add numbers with three and five as number one and number two respectively and then we're adding them together and we are tying them to this resort variable now this works fine and we could print out the result and it would print for us so let's go ahead and do that right now I'm gonna disable my other script and let's run this and so we should get a result of eight which is great so we've got our result but now it's been calculated what if you want to do something with that result maybe we want to use it later on okay so let's say we've got our result of eight it's been printed out but now what if we wanted to later on print out that you know print out that number eight I know he printed it in the function but what he wanted to print it's after we'd calculated it right or maybe for something else I don't know maybe we wanted to do like a calculation with that number we can't we can't get that number because we've we've printed out in the function but it's not stored anywhere once we've calculated it it's it's stored locally in this variable but nowhere else what we could do is maybe create a from a variable outside of here called saved value and then we could say saved value equals number one and number two and then later on we could get the saved value but the problem with that is that it's going to get overwritten and it's just not efficient because eventually we're gonna call this function again and save value is gonna get overwritten so how do we send this saved value or this result back to where we called it from because we might want to do something with it later on and you you can't have it in the function because this function is only meant to add the numbers together well that it's we're returning comes in returning allows you to send some information back from this function back down to where we called it from so that we can use it later on so to return something what you do is you you basically stop the function so when you return something the function stops running and it sends some information back to where we call it from so we need to return some information you could return nothing and that would just stop the function but if you want to send a message back or some data we can return whatever we like so he could return the result variable that we just created or we could return number one at number two but we're gonna return results that's we could do either but we've saved we stored a number warning in between a variable so we return our result and now we've sent that data back down here to where we have called the function so it can be used somewhere else but we we can't actually you know access this data because we now need to store that as a very so anything that we return that we want to use later on we have to save in a variable so let's just create a variable here so local and let's just call it mm calculation result you can call it whatever you like I'm just gonna call it calculation result and now what's gonna happen is the result of the two numbers we added together so in this case it will be 8 it gets returned and now calculation result is equal to 8 so at the moment it's set to calling this function but when you return sort of thing to this function then the calculation result will become whatever is returned so it's now going to be 8 so if we printed out calculation result it's going to print out 8 for us and notice how we haven't printed in the function so this is actually being printed down here it's been we've called our function it's added the two numbers that we gave together and it's returned it back to this variable it's now stored in calculation result and we can use it outside of the function we could maybe multiply it by 10 if you wanted to and then we would get 80 so what's happened is the function has done the right thing it's it's added our numbers together and then it's sent the result back to us so that we can do something else with it later on so that's how you return but you probably wanting to know a you know a practical use of returning because you could just add two numbers together and print them out there's nothing stopping you so I'm gonna show you another example and by the way sorry about my voice I'm currently suffering with a cold so here we go our second example you can disable the first script we had there we go here's my second example so we have a function here which will create a part and I'm passing through arguments for the transparency the color and whether it's anchored or not and in this function I'm creating the part I'm setting the transparency and the color and the anchored properties and then I'm putting it in the workspace if I run the script you will see that the part gets created I just can't find it oh the script is disabled still whoops you will see this time that the part gets created okay with our properties so it's it's red this is basically a color three value made up of three values RGB and this means red it was semitransparent so naught point five and it was also anchored so we've created this part but now that I've created it I can't actually change any other properties I can't just you know say of create parts blah blah blah dot reflectance like this okay I can't I can't do this I can't change a property of it after after I've called the function so how am I gonna get this part so that I can do something with it later on well you could say game dot workspace dot part but what if you have lots of parts created with the same name or you know you you didn't or you had a parts and you didn't know what the name was because you might specify the name here and it could change whatever you need to have a way to access this part that you've just created and right now we've just called the function to create the part when the parts created this function just stops running and we can't access it anymore so we need to return the part back to where we called it from so I'm gonna say return parts and if you're wondering what you can return you can return any data you could return a string so text a number a boolean value so true or false or even an object like we're doing in this case we are returning our part which is an object in the game that we've just created so when I say return part it's going to send back to where we called it from a reference to this part and as I've said before we need to set it as a variable so that we can reference it in the future and we can get it so I'm going to say local I'm gonna give it a name can be anything so you can say my returned part equals and this way when we call the front whatever gets returned so in this case the part is going to now be this is going to be equal to this variable it's going to be set to this variable so when we say my returned part we can now access its properties and we have a unique reference to this part and that's it in the game so we can now say my return part and we could change its color again if we wanted to to color 3 from RGB don't worry you don't have to do this I'm now setting it to blue okay because we have red green and blue sorry green we're setting it to green because I've told it to here so we can change the properties again once it's been returned so let's run this and hopefully we now have a green part I know I set it to red over here but what happened is that the part got created and then as soon as it was created immediately after we updated the color again so you didn't see it change so we can change all of the properties we can have a unique reference to this part after we've created it because you might want to do something to it once you've created it you want to have like a a reference to a way to access it once you've created it and that's what returning allows you to do it allows you to do something the function and then you can send some data back but that is not the end and returning can also be used to send messages I said about strings earlier well you could have a function that maybe checks something or calculate something and you want to know whether it was a success or not well you could return true or false depending on what went wrong you could return a string with like an error code and then you could interpret it later on to see if something was wrong in your script so there's lots of uses for returning and we'll be looking at more of those in a future episode but this is all you need to know right now is that returning allows you to send data back from a function so they can be used later on because if you think about it if we have a function and we're running it multiple times creating multiple parts or doing multiple calculations we can't actually get a reference get some access back to the things that we're creating so if we return the part then we can have it you know stored for later on we might want to do something else to him so that was a quick video on returning if you
