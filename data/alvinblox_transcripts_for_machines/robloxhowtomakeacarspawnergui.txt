today I'm gonna be showing you how to make a car spawner on roblox so you can pay money to buy a car and then you can spawn it let's get started is we're gonna insert a leaderboard script which will control the amount of cash that each player has in the game so we're gonna click on this little plus icon next to service crypt service and then we're going to click on script and once you've done that we're going to do a player added event so you need to type game dot players dot player added connect function PLR just as it is shown on screen now what will happen is when a player joins the game there will be any code inside of this this little event here will run and you can see it says PLR this is the player that's going to join the game so what we're gonna do is we're going to insert something called leader stats and inside of there we're going to put all of their cash and maybe other values in there later so what we're gonna do is we're gonna say local leader stats equals instance new bracket close bracket and then in these speech marks we're gonna say int value or actually wouldn't say folder it doesn't matter it could be a model it could be a folder but we need to call these leader stats leader saps all in lowercase so we're gonna say leader stats don't name equals and in speech marks a leader stats just like this and it has to be lowercase and it has to be spelled correctly else the cash won't show up on your screen we then need to put these leader stats in the player so in the same leader stats got parents equals PLR you always have to put the parent you have to specify the parent of the object at the end and once you've got all the properties done so now that we've got our leader starts we need to insert a cash object so we're gonna do the same thing again we're just gonna drop a line I'm gonna say local cash equals instance don't you open bracket close bracket and then in these speech marks we're going to say that cash if you want yours to be called money or something else get change cash to money okay so what we've done or what we need to actually call this an int value and then down here you can say cash drop name equals and then speech marks you can call it cash so you have to say that it's an int value because it's going to carry a number and then we give it a name and let's give the player a number of cash suing say cash drop value equals and then we'll give them 500 cash to start off with now I have a data saving tutorials if you want to save your data in game you can watch that it will be in the card in the top right corner of the screen but now we should have our cash our leaderboard so let's just go and play the game and hopefully we should have our leaderboard in the top right corner and I just realized we need to put the cash inside after me to stop so you can say cash drop parents equals leader stats and then if we go and play the game the leaderboard should be in the top right corner there we go so now we've got our currency system done we can start making the purchase GUI so what we're going to do is we're going to first create a folder in replicated storage called folder okay and we're gonna call this cars and once you've done that we actually we're going to drag this into server storage we're going to get our cars so if you've got some cars already make them a model make sure they're a model and just drag them inside this server storage I'm gonna get some cars from free models we're gonna take an army car a transporter and a basic car as well as an offroader and you can see they've all got names you need to make sure they've got a name and then you're just going to drag them all into server storage like that now let's get started by designing our GUI so I'm going to click on start to do I'm gonna click on the plus then I'm gonna click on screen GUI and I'm gonna call this purchase GUI once you've done this we're gonna insert a frame so we're going to click the plus and click frame and then what we can do is we can change the size of it if you want I'm going to change mine to 500 by 400 and then I'm going to put it in the middle of the screen by changing the position to not 0.5 negative 250 as the offset and 0.5 is the scale for the vertical and we're going to do offset or minus 200 as that's half of the scale and now the GUI is in the middle of our screen so what we want to do now is why sure you can make the G or you can make the GUI look a bit better if you want I'm going to change the style to drop shadow because it looks it looks more professional and much nicer and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna insert an image button into our GUI in fact we're going to do an image label instead and then we will do a button underneath it so what we're gonna do is we're going to call this image label car for now and then what we're going to do is we're going to just move it so that it's just away from the edges of our GUI so we can say in 0.1 and with the same note point 1 for the horizontal and vertical positions and this will just put it a little bit out from the border so once you've done that we're going to insert a text button inside of there and we're going to set the scale of this we're going to set the size to 1 0 0 25 and then we can click a button we can click on the text property of this button and we can change it to say purchase and then we're going to click text scaled and we're going to change the font to bold now you can also change the style of this if you want I'm gonna have a look at what there is and I'm gonna change my actually I'm not going to change it I'm just gonna keep it to custom I'm going to make the background color a little bit green though so we can see that it is a purchase button and then what I'm going to do I'm going to set the position to a 120 we're just going to set it to 1 actually so it's underneath the image label so we've got our picture of our car we will put the image of it in the image label soon and we've also got our text button so you may have multiple cars in your game so if you have more than one car just copy this image label and paste it and then you can move you can change the position to let's see not point 4 so I just added point 3 on to the position and you can see it's moved across I'm gonna add another one I'm going to change it to not point 7 and then you can if you want even more what you can do is you can just copy another one so I'm going to copy the first one and I'm just gonna change the vertical position to not not wait for let's change it to not 0.5 so that it's just underneath the first button so I've got 4 cars so I'm gonna have 4 different buttons so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna get the pictures for our image labels so we're just going to click visible we're gonna uncheck it so that we can take some pictures now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go into the tool box and because I've already got pictures of my cars here I can just screenshot them and then I can just upload them to roblox but if you've got your own custom cars you can just drag your cars out of this folder into the workspace and then you can just take some pictures of them so I will just take a screenshot of this and then I'm going to copy up and I can upload it to roblox ok so I've got all of my images uploaded to roblox I uploaded them by going to the create tab and then I click on decals and then I can just select all of my images and upload them so I'm gonna get the ID from each decal on the website so you just go to your decal and in the website link there is a number that is the ID of the decal and you just want to paste them into this property down here we're gonna make the frame visible and then we're gonna select each car and we're going to paste in our IDs so here's my first one and there we go we have our we have our car and we're now gonna get the offroader and we're gonna put it in here on the next one so you just need to put all of your images in here so now we're gonna get the normal red car and that's going in and we'll finally we're gonna have the army truck and I'm gonna put the ID in here so there we go we've got all of our four cars now in our GUI now what we need to do is we need to click on each image label and we need to name this image label the same name as the as the cars name so this is the let's have that I think it's the van yep so this blue car is called van so I'm gonna select this image label I'm gonna go to the name property and I'm going to change it to van I'm gonna click on enter then when you go to the next one which is the offroader I'm going to name it exactly the same so off loader because that's how it's spelt up here it has to be the same name as the model then we go to the next one which is the red car and then what we're going to do is we're gonna change the name of this image label to car but it's already set to car because we that's what we called it earlier and we can go to the last one which is called the army truck so we're just gonna click on enter and we've got all of our image labels named so what we need to do now is begin scripting our cars so what we need to do we need to work out how much each car should cost so maybe one should be more expensive than the other so what we're going to do is we're going to go into each model of our car here and we're going to insert a value called price now what we do we're gonna search for an int value and we're gonna click on it and where is it there we go is called value and we're just gonna change this to price now you can put your own price number in here I'm gonna set this one to 500 and then I'm just going to copy this value I'm gonna close down the army truck I'm gonna paste it into the car and I'm going to change the price of the car to 200 and then we can just close that down paste it into the offroader and change the price of that I'm gonna set this one to 1000 and then what we're going to do is we're just going to do the same thing in the van I'm going to change the van to 750 so they've all got different prices and their price in value has been added into the into the into the cars what we need to do now is we need to put a text label into each image label which shows the price of the cars okay so we're going to just change this to 50 and we can set this one to 20 I'm going to change the background transparency to 9.5 and I'm going to click on text scaled now we can put price as the text and then we can insert a local local scripts into here and later on we'll be able to display the price of the cars as we will script that later on so we're just gonna leave this text label in here for now we can call it price label and we will deal with that later on so now it's time to start scripting the buying off of the car now because this is going to be filtering enabled compatible we can't put the prices of the cars on in the GUI because if a hacker joined the game they could change the prices to whatever they want so we have to keep the prices on the server and the prices are inside the trucks which are hosted on the roblox service so hackers can't change the prices but this means that we have to use something called a remote remote function to get the price from the server and send it back to us just to tell us how much it costs so I did a video on remote functions if you want to learn more about them I'll put a card in the top right of the screen but what we're going to do is we're going to insert a remote function into replicated storage I'm gonna call it check price okay and then what we can do is we can go into our text button we're gonna change the name of it to by button and we're going to insert a local script into it so what we're going to do is we're going to have another event here and this event is called the mouse button worndown mouse button one click event sorry so what will happen is when a player clicks on the GUI on Gy button the event will run and we can make them purchase the car so we can say script or parents because that's the button and then we say dot mouse button one click the connects Open bracket function open bracket close bracket and then we can just drop a line so anything inside of this event will run when the player clicks on the button so what we want to do is we want to check if the player has enough money to buy this vehicle so we're going to want to send a request to this remote function which is going to check the price of the car and it's going to send it back to us so we can check to see if they have enough money so what we can do is we can say check a price actually once a price of item equals game lot replicated storage and then we can say wait for child we just say check price inside please speech marks and then we can say invoke server okay and we're going to put in speech marks the name of the car and so the name of the car is equal to the name of the image label so we can just say script doc karent's dot parents name because script parent dot parent is this image label and it's called van so we are sending the name of the car that we want to check the price off and what this is going to do is it's going to return back that price ask this variable so this variable will be a number I'm just gonna make this local as well what we need to do now though is we need to actually script this remote function then when it gets the request it knows that it's going to check the price of the car and it's going to send it back to us so to do this we're just going to say game don't write the paper storage wait for child and then in speech marks we can say check price and then what we're going to say is dot on server invoke so when the server has been invoked by the client wanting to know how much your car is we're then going to say equals function and then I'm gonna have a set of brackets and then we can say inside of here player comma and then we can say name of car okay so the player has to be automatically defined and the client will send over the name of the player who called this this remote function and we've also got our parameter which is the name of the car and remember how in the local script we're sending script or parent a parent name well that is going to be the name of the car so what we can do is we can drop a line here and you see ID is in an end now all we need to do to send back how much this car costs to the script we just need to say return game dot serve storage dot cars curl on find first child and then because we all the cars are going to be inside this folder they're currently in the workspace but we can move them into this folder now because we don't need them and what we're gonna do we're just going to put speech marks actually we're not going for speech marks we're just gonna write a name of car okay and then we can just say dot price drop value because we've got that value called price which we added in earlier on into the cars we're just finding that value and we're gonna send over back to the local script the value of that price object so if it was 500 it would be returning 500 so let's go and test this out in the command bar so we click play and let's just print down here in the command bar we're gonna say game dot replicated storage check price invoke server car with a name car that's there we want to check the price of the car which is called car which is the red car I'm gonna print that okay so let's go and invoke that and you see it has returned back 200 because the red car in service storage the red car had a price value of 200 let's try this with the offroader you can see it's sent back 1000 because the offroaders price value is 1000 just like that so our remote function is ready to go and we can now return back the price of the item okay so the price of the item will be the value which will be returned so just imagine that that's 500 or 1000 or have a match however much the car costs so we need to check if the user can afford this car so we're gonna say if game dot players not local player don't lead us that's got cash dot value is greater than or equal to the price of the item so if they have just enough or more then the we can put a comment saying that the player has enough cap so we're going to deduct the cash from their account because they've just purchased it so we can say game dot players locally player but leader stuff got cash got value equals Runa just copy and paste the same thing cuz we want to get their current value and we want to take away the price of the item okay so now their account has been deducted by the amount of how much this car costs and now they have officially purchased this car and now they're able to just spawn it in okay so what's going to happen is when the player first purchases it there's going to be a value inside of the image label and we're gonna click on the plus here and we're gonna click on food value okay and we're going to then change the name to purchased so have they already purchased it or not if they haven't already purchased it then the if they already if they buy it then it's not going to spawn but if they click it again after they've already bought it then the car will spawn so what we're going to do is we're going to head into the script here and if they've bought it we're going to say script dot parent dot parent purchase dot value equals true so we know that they've now purchased it and we also in this if statement we want to say if they have enough money and script dot parent script dot parent dot parent purchase value equals equals false since they haven't already bought it then we'll let them buy it and we also then want to say at the top of this script if script dot parents dots of parents purchased value equals equals true then okay and you can see we've got this end added in here we're going to copy that and we're going to paste it right at the bottom of the scripts like this and then we're just going to highlight everything inside these if statement and click on tab just to indent it and make it look nice and neat okay so what we want to do here is if they've already purchased it we want them to be able to spawn it so we're gonna add an else here because inside this else then we're going to let them purchase it because they haven't already purchased it because it will be equal to false so we're gonna say let them purchase it but if it's already if the value is set to true and they've already purchased it then we want to spawn this a car so to spawn the car what we're going to do is we're going to have a remote events in replicated storage so let's click on the plus and click on remote events or let's type it in we're then going to give it a name called spawn car and we're going to then say game don't replicate the storage dot spawn car coal on fire server and then we can say scripts parent stock parent don't name because that is the name of the car the name of the image label is the same as the name of the car so we can just call this remote event I wanna say okay spawn in the car which has this name we now need to go back into our main script on the server and we need to create another event for the remote event don't forget to save your work if you haven't already just click on the Save button up here and it's gonna save your work okay so we're going to drop a few lines in this main script and then we're gonna say down what replicated storage and then we can say come on wait for trial and then in speech marks we're gonna say spawn car like this and then we can say dots on silver events colon connect open bracket function open bracket close bracket and then we're going to have player as our first parameter and name of car as the second one so what we can do now is we can drop a line and we want to spawn the car next to the player so what we're going to do is we're going to we're gonna say game actually we need to first get the car from the cars folder so we're going to say local car equals game but server storage dot cars flying first child and then in speech marks we're gonna actually not in speech marks I'm just gonna say name of car and like this okay so we've got the car out of server storage and we now want to just put coal on loan like this so we've made a clone of it okay so what we're going to do now is we're going to change the see frame of the car so that we can move it just next to where the player is so to do this we can just say car set primary Part C for him and then we can do in brackets player dot character dot humanoid root parts dot C frame plus vector three dot new open bracket close bracket zero comma zero comma 15 make sure that your C frame has capital C and a capital F and the reason that we add the extra vector 3 new 0 0 15 is so that it doesn't spawn on the player but it spawns just a few studs away from them and we're set in the primary part C frame of the model so you need to make sure that your car has a primary part so you need to if you're just if you're to check if it has a primary part you need to open up the properties window and click on your model and if there is something in the primary part here then that's all good you have a primary part if it doesn't you need to click it and you need to then find any part inside of this model you should use the driving seat though and just click it to add that primary pup if you don't have a primary part it won't work because that's what we're moving and if there isn't a primary part then it won't be able to be moved so make sure you've got your primary pop and then after that what we're going to do is we're going to put the car in the workspace why sitting car what parent equals workspace and then to stop it from breaking up when it gets in the workspace we're gonna say car make joints so there doesn't fall apart so let's go and try this out let's click on the play button and I'm going to call the event down here from the event from the command bar to just test it will click enter and our car has been spawned in so there we go we've got our car and we're almost ready to go ok so there we go we have our Buy button and what we're doing is we are going to spawn the car if the player has bought has already bought it what we're also going to do is we're going to head back into the main script and we're just going to say car dot name equals and then when you say player dot name dot dot and then we can say in speech marks and apostrophe s and then we can do another two dots and we can say name off car now what this will do is it will set the cars name to the players names and then the name of the car so for example if we just go and run this again the car has spawned in but it's called Alvin blocks his car now let's just go and put a space after this s so that now there should be two words and it should be called Alvin blocks his car there we go so you can see the car spawned in and it's been called Ivan blocks his car because I am the person who spawned it in now all we need to do is we need to we need to make this work for all the other cars so what we're going to do is we're going to take this local script and we're just going to paste it into the text of buttons here we're going to paste it into every single one and we also want to make sure that we copy this purchase to value and we paste it into each image label as well so now that we've done that we should be able to purchase some cars now make sure that you just go into these script service into the script and you give yourself enough cash to be able to purchase the cars and there we go let's try and purchase the red car so I'm gonna click on purchase and now if we click it again we should have spawned it and there we go now if we try and spawn it again we can spawn it in as many times as we like because we've purchased it and we can go and try and buy another car so we can just keep buying all of these cars until we run out of money but make sure that you don't spawn them on top of each other else they will go a little bit messy like that one over there there we go the next thing that we're going to want to do is we want to click on the purchased GUI and make sure that reset on spawn is unchecked otherwise if the player resets they're gonna have to buy the vehicle all over again so make sure that that's on checks and then we're also just gonna do one last little addition to the script we're going to make it show on the text label whether you've bought it or not and whether you can spawn it ok so to do this what we're going to do is we're going to change the text of the buy button so we're gonna take script your parents got x equals spawn just like that okay and that's all we need to do let's go and test this out on the run so we click purchase and then it says spawn and if we reset because we unchecked reset on spawn it should say of stea spawn and we should be able to spawn it in as many times as we like ok it did not it reset that was because reset on spawn was was checked let's go and uncheck it and try again we click it once it says spawn and if we reset it should stay as spawn on our screen there we go and were able to spawn it in again so there we go we are now just going to update this again by taking this local script copying everything inside it and updating it for every other Buy button ok so that is the purchasing side done let's just go ahead and just show the prices of the cars like we would we're doing at the at the start of the tutorial so this is very simple all we need to do is we can just go back to our one of our Buy button scripts and we can take the price of item code here and we can just go back to the price label script and paste that in so we've now got the price of our item what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add a quick weight here just to make sure that everything's loaded and ready and then what we can do is we can say script parent text equals price of item and if we're going run the game the price should show up and there we go 750 is the price and if you want to add a little dollar sign in there you can just add speech marks add your dollar sign in and then put two dots to concatenate this together and have the price with it so it's just going run again and there we go 750 dollars is how much it costs so let's go back to this price label and we're going to just copy the price label and paste it into all of the image labels remember if you have more than four cars you'll need to do this for every single car you add in and I think that should be the end of the tutorial I think that is yep yeah oh wait no we need to add a close button for our purchase GUI we need to have a special button which will open and close it so we can just add a text button here let's scroll down and let's call it open slash close actually let's call it car purchase cast warning and we'll click text scaled we'll just put it in the middle of the screen vertically by setting not 0.5 and minus 25 and let's insert a quick local script in here and let's say scripts for parents got mouse button one click connect open bracket function I close bracket and then when you say Scripps dot parent dot parent dot frame visible equals not and then we can just take this and copy it and paste it in again and what this will do is it will invert the current status of the frame visibility so if it's currently set to true it will be set to false and if it's set to false it will be set to true because we use this not to invert it let's go and test this out and click play and there we go we can open and close the GUI we can purchase all of our cars and if we don't have enough money let's go and just change our money to zero we shouldn't be able to spawn the cars yeah there we go we're not allowed to spawn them only when we have enough money so there we go we have just created a car spawn of GUI in roblox studio if you enjoyed this tutorial
