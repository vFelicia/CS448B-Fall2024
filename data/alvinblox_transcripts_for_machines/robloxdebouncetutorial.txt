if you want to learn how to use debounce in roblox to do to stop a function from running too many times like this then you're gonna want to make sure that you watch all of this video all the way to the end so you don't miss our and anything let's get started all right so welcome back to another video my name is Ivan blocks and today we're gonna be learning how to use D bounce now if you don't know what D bounce is it stops a script from running a certain function multiple times in a certain span of time so for example each time I got to step on this brick it's gonna print brick was touched in the output but you see as I walk around the brick you can see that it keeps printing it hour you can see we've got the multiplication sign next to how many times it has printed and what if I only wanted it to run the code once only once every 5 seconds so that it wouldn't spam this function all the time and it wouldn't keep printing it all the time well there's a very cool way to get around this and it's called D bounce so let's go and have a look at it now so I've got this script here and when I step on the brick we've got a touched event and it's going to print brick was touched what if I only want this to run once for example you may want to use D bounce on a weapon because you might not want people to be able to spam click the weapon and have lots of projectiles going from the rocket in in short amount of time because you want to have a reload time so this is where we use D bounce we use it mostly in touched events because when you touch a brick when you touch a part in roblox and see we've got our a player here now we've got two legs okay and it could either beat the left leg or the right leg which touches it or the head could touch it or one of our arms you can see we've touched it here arm just touched it but our leg touches it now so we can have a lot of different body parts touching and setting off this event at once so we only wanted to run one time so we don't have duplicates running which could the lag our game or possibly cause it to break if we're adding too many things into our character for example say you wanted to add value into your character when you stepped on the brick and it added tons of values in because you kept touching it and you only wanted one that could break your game so that's why we use D bounce so when we step on this brick this touched event is going to run so how do we only stop it how do we stop it from only running multiple times how are you how do we make it run once was a simple a way to do this by doing debounce and we need a variable at the top of our script this is gonna check whether we've already touched the brick on up so we're gonna call this variable D bats local debounce equals false now you can call it whatever you want but I'm gonna call it D bats just so that it makes sense and we can understand what it means so when this block is touched we're going to set the the bounce value to true so we're gonna say d bounce equals true okay so when they step on it the debounce variable is gonna be true so when it's true we're going we're basically going to know that the brick has been stepped on if it's false we know that the brick has not been stepped on okay and after a number of seconds we can set it back to false and when it's false we're going to make it so that we can run the script again so we're going to then drop a line and we're gonna say white and we're gonna put a number inside of here so let's do five seconds okay now what we need to do is add an if statement and before we do that we're just gonna set D bounce back to false so we now need to have our if statement which will check if D bounce is false or if it's truth so to do this at the top of our events or just inside of it above the first D bounce equals true we're gonna say if not D bounce then and then at the end of the scripts we're going to write end and we're just going to select all of the code inside the if statement and indent it so we're checking if D bounce is not false okay so if D bounce is true this means that the brick has already been touched and and we can't run the script but if if not debounce means that it is false so if the bounce is false means hasn't been touched then we can set D bounce to truth we can make the code run and we can wait five seconds until we set it back to false and if someone tries to step on this brick again they're going to hit this if statement and because we set it to true already and they're they're touching it again debounce is going to be true and so we can't ruin the if statement so it's not going to do anything it's gonna register the touch but it's not going to do this print because we've set the debounce to true and after the five seconds we're gonna set it back to false and so when it runs again when it loops again after five seconds we're gonna be able to print the brick was touched again okay so let's go and test this out I'm gonna click on play and we're just going to clear the output now let's just run over here to the brick I'm going to step on it MC says brick was touched and you see it didn't print multiple times it didn't have that x and then number next to it so it's only printed once and the five seconds have passed the debounce how the debounce variables go back to false so now when we step on it again we're gonna hit this if statement which says if debounce is equal to false so if not debounce means if debounce is false which it is we're gonna set the debounce to true so that if we touch it again it's not going to pass through it's just going to get out of the if statement and it's going to print that the brick was touched all right let's go and test this out and there we go we've got brick was touched now if we wait five seconds and stay on the brick you can see it's gone two times three and every five seconds if we move again it will just keep going up in ones because we've got that debounce stopping us from touching the brick multiple times now if we if we were to get rid of this debounce if we just got rid of the if statement and the whole variable and the wait you'll see if we go back and step on the brick let's go and clear the output and stand on here you can see it's printing multiple times and we and this is why we use debounce we use debounce to only register a function or touch once now you can use it in lots of other events such as when you click a button you're only allowed to click it once when you fire a rocket and you can learn more about events in my event video the card will be in the top right of the screen about now alright so let us go over this once more so let's just get our debounce script back and so we've got our debounce variable we're sitting that's false so when debounce is false we should be to run the code and when it's true we won't be able to run it so we're gonna do here in this variable I'm gonna say if it isn't pressed so if not means the opposite of deep true so false so if dbus is false then we can set the bounce to true so that if we set off the script again it's not going to set off this if statement and the code won't run again until five seconds later when it's set to false down here so that was a simple tutorial on how to use the bouncing robots to do if you enjoyed it please smash that like button please click the subscribe button
