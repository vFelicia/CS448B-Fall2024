so you might have been watching my previous video on how to make cutscenes in roblox I do recommend you go and watch it you might be wondering well how do i trigger the cutscene to happen at a certain time so for example when a player when a round starts or when a player escapes you know from from a piggy room or you know maybe if they just step on a brick or something like that how do you make the cutscene happen at a specific time because out of the minute you play the game the cutscene will happen pretty much straightaway after 5 seconds so you know how can we make this cutscene only happen when you've done something and I will show you how that works so in roblox we obviously have local scripts which run on the client on your computer and they're the script that will be in the started GUI with a starter pack we'll start player ok in their local because they run on your computer whereas the game and the server scripts which control you know what what happens in the workspace and in the game and in your controls everything that all the players see which aren't things like your camera and GUI because they're specific to certain players well are most of our code is server code right running on the server so how do we trigger these cutscenes in these GUIs or whatever to appear on a player screen a specific time well if our code is running in a server script we can trigger this cutscene so you can see here I've got this function called tween and I'm just calling it after 2 seconds to tween the camera what we can do is we can use a remote event or remote events very simple or remote function only use a remote event because we don't need to return anything back to the server so a remote event is something that you can trigger on the server and you can then on the client listen out for when it's fired and when it does get fired from the server we can trigger this code to happen locally on the client so I'll give you an example right I'll create a remote event I'll call it cutscene you have to call it cutscene but if I fire it by saying game don't replicate this storage dot cutscene curl on fire clients cuz I'm firing it for a specific client I only want it to fire for a specific player and so we need to tell it which player are we gonna fire it for and so for example let's create an event right so let's create a part and we'll just call this test and we can say game don't work space test doctor Colonel connect function so whenever the brick is touched by something if the thing that touched the brick so hit if game so we'll create a variable for the player it's gonna be game dot players get player from character hit rock parents because hit dot parent is going to be their character and then if that is a player so this will either be true or false depending on there is a player in the game with character so if there is a player then we can fire a cutscene remote event for that specific player right and then on the client we can say game don't replicate the storage cutscene on client event when it's fired from the server to the client we can connect and we can run a function and in this function we're going to have our to the lines of codes that trigger this cutscene to happen so what will happen is only when this remote event gets fired and that will only be when something to when a player touches the brick it will start the cutscene so let me show you so we go in here now and we step on the brick you can see it hasn't happened straightaway the cutscene when I step on the brick you can see it started the cutscene now you did see a bit of a glitch there because it's it run it twice and that's because I didn't add a debounce to the brick I didn't stop it from like there's not a cooldown on it so I could keep jumping on it and it will restart like that but that is how you trigger the cutscene to happen okay and you know you might also be thinking what it I'm in my game and I want to trigger it for all players in the game how can I do that well if you want to trigger it for all players that are currently in the game you could say fire all clients like and if you just do a wait five seconds to allow the players to join before it runs when you do fire all clients it will fire their own motor vents for every player in the game so obviously there's only one in this game but if there were say ten players they would all see this happening at once whereas if you do fire a client and you give a specific player it will only fire the remote event and run the code on the client for them so of course you can also fire it for a specific player outside of a touched event or something like that if you know the player so let's say you could put game dot players wait for trial Alvin underscore blocks and this is assuming that I'm already in the game this wouldn't work normally because you can't tell the players that will be in the game but I'm just saying because obviously we know that I'm going to be joining the game it will work for me so if we just wait 15 seconds that should start the cutscene but you usually be using things like for loops to find out what to do it to all players or to find a specific a specific player you can see it started as well or you'd be able to you have maybe like a from my piggy game for example you know who the piggy is and you know who the contestants are so you could loop through all the contestants and you could fire a client for those that are a contestant whereas if you knew who the piggy was you could put the pig in in this brackets here so that's how you trigger the cutscenes to happen on the on the client but what if you wanted to every time you had a new cutscene you wanted to specify a new start and end point or you could take some information you could have B you could have the start point and the end point right and the time time length I'm just going to call it and then you could just get rid of this second tween and you could instead of having the information here you could just put start points end points and time length and then when you fire the cutscene from that from the client let's do fire all clients you could put the information in here right so game toys space test1 again it was we still test two and one and that would still work so let me show you again and play the game and just wait the five seconds obviously oops I accidentally started it my bad because I stepped on the brick or in fact no it did itself it did it automatically starts automatically because we haven't got that touch detection anymore so you can see it works and it only did the one tween so if you wanted to do more tweens of course you could just keep on firing this you know from test to test three and you go test three about to test one for example and that would still do its job so that is how you do the cut scenes from a server scripts and you know trigger that triggering them for certain players as well so I hope that was useful don't forget to leave a like on the video if it was subscribe and also this applies to GUIs as well right if you wanted to make a GUI appear and you could have a remote event fire client for it and then pick it up in a local script and when you do pick it up in the local script you could make the GUI visible or invisible or between its be on your screen etc anyway hope it was useful if it was drop a like make sure to smash the subscribe button share it with a friend so they can get this knowledge as well and please check out my other videos including my cutscene video and my live events video which I went which went live this week so hope you enjoy and I'll catch you in the next video thanks for watching
