in this section of videos I'm gonna be teaching you about GUI is in roblox everything you need to know about how they work so firstly you should know that GU is graphical user interfaces they show things on the screen for the player so any thing that you see in the game in a roblox game that is 2d on the screen so like text or images or you know those the UI the user interface that's made up of GUI elements so there's lots of different GUI elements things like text labels text buttons frames image labels and they all work together to create the interface that you see in most roblox games one all roblox games will have Q eyes now there are things called core GU eyes and they differ from normal GUI ice because core GU eyes look the core GUI is made by roblox so it's things like the chat window the top bar the leaderboard all of these things are made by roblox they come in every single game so we call them the core GUI and you can see in core GUI here if I was to delete everything in the core GUI they would just all go away apart from the chat but that's somewhere else obviously and the core GUI by the way don't worry about that you only see it when the game is running and we never really touch it anyway because it's all managed by roblox anyway so all GU eyes will go into the starter GUI now each player in the game has their own container for GU eyes because it's likely that different players in the game will have different GU eyes visible at one time so for example in a murder game the murderer is going to be shown a different GUI than an innocent person to show that they are innocent so the each player is going to have a slightly different folder of GUIs so if we put in a GUI a screen gon starts to UI and I just name it test if we actually just launched a server here so I can show you so it may look a little bit confusing at first but what we've got here is we've just opened up a roblox game and on that we've got two players in the game on the Left we've got player one on the right we've got player two so each player will have their own collection of GUIs so that if you wanted to change GUI for a certain player we could do that so when the game starts and a new player enters the game what happens is everything that's inside of the starter GUI gets copied and it gets put into a folder inside each player called player GUI so if we look in here in game dot players and a certain player object so player one you can see there's a folder called player GUI and in there we've got a couple of core GUI as well so things like the bubble chat but if we've also got our test GUI so this is a clone of the one in started GUI so if I had created the GUI so just got a GUI here and actually I need to just so I've restarted the test place and I've edited the tested GUI and started GUI so this test GUI has now been cloned into the player GUI for player 1 it's also been done for player 2 as well so every player in the game will have their own copy of the GUI from started GUI so if we wanted to change what this GUI said midway through the game well unfortunately you can't just go in to start a GUI change that GUI that was in there originally and expect that it's going to update for all players so if I change text of the text button to by you see nothing happens because it's only changed the the GUI that's stored in the starter GUI but we know that GUI is only appear on a player screen when we're actually in a running game if it's in the player GUI so we have to update every player's GUI manually so we'd have to go into that player GUI and change it there and now in the player GUI if we change it to say by you can see it changes so this GUI in player GUI and this GUI in started July they are two completely different things you can't just update one and think that it's gonna change for all players because it won't it will only change in that started GUI but no GUI eyes are rendered in a running game when they're inside have started to UI because when a player joins the game or they reset just like their character resets the GU eyes get pulled out of started GUI and basically the game copies them and places them into the player GUI you can also see that because I've changed player wounds the text of the text button for player ones player GUI what's happened is it stayed the same for player two and that's because as I said earlier each player is going to have their own player GUI so if you change one players play GUI then it will then be different to someone else's if you wanted to change player 2 so then we'd have to go in and change theirs as well and now we can both we have though basically the same GUI now because it's got the same text but the test GUI in player two's plays UI is a completely different object to the test GUI in player ones even though they've got the same names and everything completely different things so we've got three different GUI say we've got one in started GUI and that's the that's the one that's copied out and put into each player started GUI into each player's player GUI when they reset so we've got that one then we've also got this one in player 1 and this one and player 2 so three different GU eyes now also you can only change your own player GUI so if we're looking at player one over here and let's pretend that we are player one if we went in and try to change player two's player GUI you can see we can't see it and we're unable to access player two's player GUI weren't able to you know change it that's because players in the game can't change other people's GU eyes because if somebody decided to be naughty and exploit the game and wanted to change some with GUI we can't allow that so roblox prevents you from changing anybody else's player GUI only that player can change it ok so again if we and now if we're on player to side on the right because we're playing as player two over here we can access player two's player gy but again we can't access player ones from player two we can only access player one from over here on the left because on the left we've what we've got two completely different instances of roblox running pretend they're on each side of the screen you've got two players playing roblox ok obviously they wouldn't have access to the explorer or property or properties or things like that but we're in roblox studio so we can emulate this but what I'm trying to say is that you can't change any other players GUIs because you only have access to your own player GUI and you only have access to that if you were exploiting anyway but that's a completely different story what you need to know is that's G wise they get copied out off the started GUI when a player joins the game or respawns what happens is the GU eyes everything inside starts GUI so all the children will get copied and put into the players player GUI now the player GUI is automatically created we don't have to make it in a script or anything it's it's managed by a roblox core script so all done for us in the background so every time a player joins or resets the entire contents of started GUI copied out of the starter GUI into the player GUI of that player ok so every single player in the game will have their own player to your wife this means that the things that are shown on a player's screen can be different to another players and we can change certain players play a GUI now only that player can change their own clay GUI but we can also change certain players GU ice or all players in the game we could change all of their GU eyes from a server script now that's probably what we will look at in the next video so if you've enjoyed this one please do leave it to like let me know what else you want to know about GU eyes when we cover them and covering them in the next set of videos be sure to subscribe to the channel for more roblox scripting videos and I'll leave a thumbnail to the next video on the screen so thanks for watching Cheers bye
