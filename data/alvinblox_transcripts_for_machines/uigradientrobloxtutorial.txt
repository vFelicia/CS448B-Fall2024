so a new feature has been added to roblox this week the UI gradient and what it does is it applies a gradient effect to your GUI elements kind of like in Photoshop or paint on that other image editing applications where you can apply not only a solid color but actually multiple colors which fade into each other in a UI element you can now do that with this UI gradient feature so to add a UI gradient you just need to select the elements in the UI that you want to add it to so you can add it to things such as a frame image button image label viewport frame text label and text button so if you just need to click on the frame or the element click on the plus and then search for the UI gradient now once you've inserted that you can change the appearance property sorry the color property under appearance and if you just click on it and then click on the three dots to the side here you have a color sequence editor and you might have seen this before in particle emitters basically allows you to add colors in a row here and they will it will basically be the gradient so you can have as many colors as you like just keep clicking to add different time points or areas of the gradient and then for each little point here if you click the arrow and the arrow goes yellow you can select the color property and add a color for that point and the color will last until you reach the next point so you can drag it out if you want the color to last for a longer time or longer for a bigger portion of the frame and then for the next few point use change the colors you have different colors here so I'm going to do an orange and then more into a going into a yellow color then we can have a green like this and then a blue and darker blue then we're gonna do a pink and you can see that this is turning into the colors of the rainbow I'll finish it off with let's do a darker like a pink like this more like a violet okay so there we go and you can see now that we've got all of the colors in this UI gradient I can move them around if I want to change the gradient a little bit once you're done with that you can click on close here and there are also some other properties that you can play around with we've got offset here so you can add an X or Y offset and that will change it quite a lot here let's just change let's do it let's do not point one there we go one two okay so yeah I would do not point to sorry zero to one so a number from zero to one and it's I think it's like how much the gradient is is where it starts from so you can see it's actually starting from no point there were two tenths so of the way through the frame which we changed it to no point five then the red would probably start from halfway through yeah there we go so kind of just that moves the point where the gradient starts and you can do that same thing for the yaxis as well like this but you can't really see that because this is currently on the xaxis and it's it's a horizontal gradient but you can change the rotation in degrees as well just like you can rotate a grade apart you can rotate the gradient like this so lots of things to play around with here very cool effect as well I've only just been playing around with it but I thought I'd let you guys know about it so let me know what you think let me know what you make with it there are loads of different use cases for and you can also edit the gradient with a script so you can make it moving gradients or things like that so I'll link a dev forum post for you below where you can find out more about the UI gradient very very cool indeed and yeah there you go thanks for watching
