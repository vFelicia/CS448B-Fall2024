so imagine you have a game where players can build on a plot and a player's finished building and they've just left the game so it's time to clean up their plot but you realize that they've placed so many parts in their plot that you don't know how to get rid of them all so what do you do well we don't want to delete the plot because we want to keep the plot in case another player joins so that's out of the equation what we could also do is we could use a for Loop to Loop over this plot and we could individually delete every single part which sounds a little bit over the top because surely there's a function in Roblox which will just let us clear everything inside of our folder or in any other object well of course there is and that's why I'm going to show you how to use clear all children very very straightforward firstly you get the object which you want to clear the children of and in Roblox we refer to a child as any object inside another object so in this case the folder is our parent because it contains all of these children which are our parts so we will find the parent which is in this case game. workspace do plot and then we'll say colon clear all children and it's just gone off your screen there but uh it you can see it says this function destroys all of an instance's children okay so clear all children with a pair of brackets on the end there because it's a function and then as soon as you press run look at that all of the parts inside the plot got deleted now is there still a use case for like I said looping through the folder and removing the parts one by one well yes kind of let me show you a little example where you might not want to use clear all children so imagine I had a shop GUI okay and I'm listing all of my products in my shop uh inside this main frame okay we've also got a UI corner and a UI grid layout now if I wanted to for example let's say you clicked on another tab in my shop okay and you no longer want to see my game passes you want to see my developer products because you want to buy some wins or some currency okay well I'm going to have to firstly clear out all of these game passes all of these products which are currently on the screen because it's not what you want to see and okay you know I could use clear all children for this use case I could use my I could get my frame which houses all of these products and I could say clear all children but I don't want to delete all of the children of this Frame I want to keep the UI corner and I want to keep the UI grid layout because if I was to delete if I was to delete the UI grid layout suddenly my products aren't going to be in a grid layout anymore so I want to keep that for sure I also want to keep my UI Corner otherwise the frame is not going to be rounded anymore so how can I clear all the children when I don't want to clear all of the children I have some exceptions and in that use case then yes you would want to instead of saying frame clear all children let's just create a local script here okay and we'll just put it in our screen GUI at the top and we'll just get this Frame that we've been working in instead of saying frame clear all children you would want to instead Loop through the contents of the frame so we'd say frame get children okay and then you could say if object is a is a frame then object destroy okay because in our previous video we looked at get children which returns a of all of these children and the value That We're looping through is obviously going to be an object so we can check to see if the object is a frame if it is a frame then we'll delete it otherwise if it isn't perhaps it might be a UI grid layout then we're not going to do anything to it and if I was to run this code you'd notice that all of the products disappear which is fine because if we then went back to our screen GUI and look at our frame the the UI corner and the UI grid layout is still there so the next time I want to insert some frames to my uh GUI here you'll notice that they still retain that grid layout but if I was to say clear all children it would essentially just delete everything and the next time I went to add a frame and kept on duplicating it it would stay in the same place because the UI grid layout has gone so yes there is a case where you'd want to use a for Loop instead but if you know that everything inside of your object once is going to be deleted you don't care about you know particular things being destroyed you just want to get rid of everything then by all means use clear all children okay I hope that video was useful if it was leave a like subscribe let me know if you have any more videos that you'd like me to cover and I'll see you in the next one
