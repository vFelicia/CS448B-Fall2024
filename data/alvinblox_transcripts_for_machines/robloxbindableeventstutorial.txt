in this video I'm going to be showing you how to use bindable events on roblox let's get started so welcome back to another tutorial my name is Ivan block sniffs it's your first time here make sure that you subscribed and that you've turned on the notification bow so you never miss out on when I upload a brand new video so what are bindable events one a bindable event is it's a type of event similar to remote events which you might have heard of before and what it does is it allows two scripts to talk to each other so one script will fire the bindable event and the second script will pick it up and listen out for this event to be triggered and when the event does get triggered it can run another piece of code so it's one script telling another script to do something else so it allows your script to communicate with each other talk to each other and they're quite useful when you're making your own games because you might want to only trigger a certain piece of code at a specific time so you can use a bindable event and trigger it from a different script to do different things so the difference between bindable events and remote events is that bindable events do are not useful for when you're trying to make your game filtering enabled or non experimental because remote events they aren't they allow you to talk they allow the client to talk with the server so the player to talk with the server however bindable events only allow you to talk on the server so you can have a server script talking to another server scripts but let's say you couldn't have a server script talking to a local script in the player everything has to be on the server so in the workspace service script service server storage when you're using bindable events so two scripts which can talk to each other on the server that is what a bind book event does so yeah it's intended for server to server not client to server so let's go and do a little example of how they work so I've got a bindable event in the workspace if you want to add one you just click on the plus and type in bindable event and I've also got two scripts in here so once called event fire and one is called event listener so the way that a bindable event will work is you have one script which fires the event and then you'll have a second script which is listening out for this event to be fired and when it's fired by the first script the second script which will be listening out for it will pick it up and will execute its code so we're going to start off with our fire swoops and we're gonna trigger this event so that it can be picked up in the listener script so an example of how this might work is let's say for example you are trying to make the bass play a different color but we're going to trigger it from a different script so let's go into our fire script and we're going to create a variable for our bindable event so let's say local bindable Advent equals game plot workspace wait for child and inside the speech marks we can save find a ball event just like this once we've done that what we're going to want to do is begin constructing the trigger so to trigger the event and to send it off to the listener we're going to do is we're going to say bindable events because that is the name of the event something on the variable and then we're gonna say a fire open bracket close bracket and that's all you have to do to fire off your bindable event so now that we fired it we need to go into the listener script and we need to write some code which will execute whenever this event gets fired by a different script so to do this we're going to create another variable for our bindable event just like we did in the first script wait for a try old open bracket close bracket and inside of these we're going to just say in speech marks find will event so we've got our bindable event which is in the workspace and now what we're going to do is we're going to create a listening event which will always be on the lookout to see when this event gets triggered when it is triggered what's going to happen is it's going to execute some code and in this case we're going to change the color of the base plate so let's say bindable event dot events color on connect open bracket function open bracket close bracket drop a few lines and now we've got our listener event so any code which goes in here in here will run when the bindable events is fired so when we fire it from this script this second script is going to run the code which is inside of this event so let's go and set the base plate to a random color so that's the game dot workspace stop face plate topper it color equals brick color new open bracket close bracket and we can say really red in fact let's make this random let's say brick color random open bracket close bracket so this is going to make me baseplate a random color so let's go and test this out we're going to head back into the base plate I'm going to click on run and if you go into the output you can see nothing has happened in fact something did actually happen the base plate just got chained to the same color because it was random so what are the chances so what I'm going to do is we're going to just go to the fire script and let's just add a weight 3 just so we can see the change happen and see it change to a different color so let's run the script again I'm gonna wait 1 2 3 and you can see it has changed to a random color let's go and run it again after 3 seconds it should change to a different color okay and it'll keep going I think it might change to the same color yeah he is because of some issues with random but let's change this to brick color got new open bracket close bracket really red let's run this and it should change to red after 3 seconds there we go so what's happened is we have got our fire script and after 3 seconds this script is firing the bindable event and then our second script is picking up this event which just got triggered and it's running this code which will make the baseplate red but what if you want to change it to a different color but you want to specify that from the fire script so what we can do is we can pass an argument here and this argument will get sent over to the listener scripts so that the listener script can update the baseplate color to whatever we specify it to be so let's say in brackets in this in these brackets in in the string let's say really blue that's gonna be our color and we've passed it as an argument you can have as many arguments as you want just separate them by commas and when you're in the listener scripts it's going to be done in order so the first argument is going to be the the color this string because it's the first one which we have which we've typed out but in our case there's only one argument which we've specified so we only need to say we need we need to write one place placeholder argument here so let's just say color because this color will be updated to the color that we actually specify when the fire script sends over really blue so it's going to take this really blue and tell the listener that the is going to be really blue so let's go and run this and hopefully the baseplate should turn really blue after three seconds so there we go it's turned blue you can see we sent the argument of really blue it's picked it up as color and it has updated the brick color to whatever that color was so that's how used bindable events and and arguments in roblox to do I hope this video helped you if it did please leave a like make sure to
