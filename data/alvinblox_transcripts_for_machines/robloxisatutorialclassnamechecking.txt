in this tutorial I'm going to be showing you how to use is a on roblox so that you can check to see if an object is a specific class name or a specific object type so let's get started welcome back to another video my name is Ivan blocks and if it's your first time on my channel then please do consider subscribing and turning on the notification bow so you don't miss out on one upload future videos so in this video we're gonna be looking at something called is ah and what this does is it allows you to check if an object is of a specific type so for example if you had a model and you wanted to check whether all of its descendants everything inside of that model were parts then you can use is a to check whether they they are a certain object so let's get started by inserting a script into the workspace and what we're going to do is we're going to insert a couple of parts into the workspace okay now that we've done that let's just group them together in the model and let's go back to our script so what we're going to want to do is we're going to just quickly create a for loop which is going to loop through everything in the model and then we're gonna check each object to see whether it's apart so we're gonna say for I comma parts in pairs Open bracket close bracket and then inside of these we can say game got workspace got model get descendants so what's it going to do it's going to get every single part inside of this model and then we can say do and what's going to happen is it's going to loop over every single part and we can check to see whether it is actually a part so what we want to say is if parts colon is a open bracket close bracket in fact we're going to do is we're going to change this part to objects which gonna change the name to object from you'll see why in a minute so let's say if objects is a open bracket close bracket and inside of here in speech marks we're gonna say parts then we're going to print the objects named and we do a space dot object that named dot dot and then in speech marks we're gonna say space is of class and then another space I'm gonna docked up objects and actually we can just say part okay so what what's happening is we're looping through every single object in this model we're checking to see whether it's a part using is a and remember what we're doing is a or is a we are going to have to have a pair of brackets or parentheses and then inside of that we're going to have some speech marks with the object type so how do you know what an object's type is because it's not the name of an object it's its type so if we go into the properties tab over here and we click on a part and you can see here there is a real only property which we can't edit called class name so every object will how its own class name and you see this class name is called part so we know we will know that this is a part if its class name is called part because this part could be called anything it could be called hello but its class name is still a part because it is a part as what we've added into the game if we look at a model we can see that its class name as a model workspace that's obviously workspace but let's insert something let's insert a humanoid that will be of class humanoid no matter what the name is it's still a humanoid and it's what's used to identify different parts so if we want to check through different parts and make sure that they are the correct type we can use is ah okay so what should happen is it should print out the object's name Park is off class part because the and it should print it out one two three four five times because everything in this model is a part and there are five objects in the in the model so let's go ahead and open up the output let's go and just clear this and let's win the game and hopefully it should print out five times and there we go it's printed out the object name part is of class part and you see it's printed out five times it's just put a x five sign just so it doesn't clog up our output so it's checked every single object and it has found that they are all parts but if well let's see let's let's imagine that there are some parts there are some objects in there that aren't actually parts let's just say else prints the objects named dr. objects dot name is not a part okay so else means that if it is not a part then it's going to print this out saying that the object named and that it's object name is not a part so let's go and add some different objects in this add a force field looks like quite a few force fields in here let's give them different names let's just give them some normal names okay and let's just add in a trust part okay a tryst part is different to a normal part by because it looks like this okay it's different to a normal part and you can see the class name is different it's just part and sort of part so the script should have some objects which it won't which won't be normal parts so it should say that there are some parts which are not actual parts and there we go it says the object named and it's got the name is not apart let's go have a look at our model yeah we can see that isn't apart because it's a force field so it's printing out these different part names because it's checked to see whether it is a part he's found that the object isn't a part so it is printing its results so is a is just a way of checking the type of an object there are lots of different objects class names and if you wanted to print let's say for example print game dot workspace model is a lemmings a model this should print out true because we're checking to see if the part in the model which is called model we're checking to see if it's class name is actually called model so because it has check this and it's found out that it's true it's going to print true to the output now let's see if we change this to part it's going to have a look and see whether this model is a part but we know it's not a part because it's actually a model the class name is a model so it's now printed false now you could also do this by just print by just saying print game dot workspace dot model dot class name ok and it would print out a model but we use is because it allows us to just get a true or false value of whether an object is a certain object or not and then we can use it in if statements while loops etc just to loop through all of our different objects in the game and make sure that they're a specific type so that's the end of this tutorial hopefully you enjoyed it found it useful if you just please
