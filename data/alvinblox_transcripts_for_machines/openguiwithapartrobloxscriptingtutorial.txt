in this video I'm gonna show you how to make a GUI appear on screen when you do some things such as stepping on a brick or walking up to something so let's begin so very simple how we do this and it involves a script on the server a script on the client and a remote events now this is all because of filtering enabled now if you're not too sure about how this works don't worry we will explain it as we go along but basically what it means is that the code that we're gonna write to detect when the brick gets touched is actually going to be running on the roblox server and the GUI is actually live on the client so the client is going to be the player that the GUI is going to show to on this server is where our code is stored and where it's going to run and we can't just access a player's and play a GUI from the server because filtering enabled stops us from doing this because it also helps us stop the exploiters so we have to use a remote event and what a remote event does is it's placed in replicated storage which is a place in the game where both the server and client can see things but only the server can make changes so what we can do is when we walk up to a brick we can fire an events and we can pick up that event on the client and when that event is picked up we can open up the GUI it sounds a little bit confusing but hopefully it will make sense as we go along so I'm just going to make this GUI invisible for now by setting the frames visible properties false you could also set this screen to you eyes enabled property to false if you want to make the entire GUI invisible but I'm going to then insert a script into service script service and I'm going to create an event and this events will detect when a player steps on a brick so we'll say game but workspace got parts got touched Connect function then we write player in here so our player argument this is going to be the player that sorry we should say hit because it's going to be the brick that touches our part so the other brick that touches it we then have to actually see if the part that touched the parts the part that touched our brick over here is the thing that touches it we need to check if it's an actual body part of a player's character or we can just check that it is an actual player so to do that we can say if game dot players gets player from character hit dot parents because if it is a body part that touches the part then its parent is going to be the character object of the player and then we can use this very nifty function which will basically tell us where there is an actual player in the game and if it is then we can fire our remote event and our remote event is going to tell the player to make the GUI visible so we need to create that remote event so we're going to say remote event put it in a replicated storage I'm gonna call it show GUI just so they're all organized and we know what everything does then I can say game but replicated storage dot show GUI fire client and what its gonna do is gonna send a request to a specific client a specific player in the game so we know the player and we can get their player object by using this line again so we just put that in there this function here it returns the player object and in in this if statement if it does return a player objects we know that it's an actual player in the game so we are sending to this player a request to show our GUI so what we then do is we now need to do a bit of client coding so we've done the server coding because we're detecting whether the part has been touched on the server and the server is owned and controlled by roblox it's where all of our server scripts will go but then our client scripts are for things like GUI is and tools because the reason we have client scripts is because there's going to be lots of players in the game and each player might have a different DUI they might have a different GUI open at a certain time so different players will need client script so that we can control them all individually so let's insert a local script in this screen GUI and we need to setup an event for when our show GUI remote event is fired so we can say game dot replicate storage dot show GUI dot on client event so when we fire a client with fire client here and then we use on client event to pick up when we have fired client from the server curl on connects function and then we add this end in here and what's going to happen is any code in between these two lines is going to run when this remote event is fired from the server and so when it is fired we want to make the for the GUI visible so we can say scripts the parents dots frame dock visible equals not well we could set it to true but if I fired it again I'd then want it to set it to false I'd want to or want it to make invisible if I fired it again so just a quick way to turn it off and on it's just right equals not script the parent frame to visible and what it's going to do is it's going to set it to the opposite of what it currently is so if the GUI is currently invisible and then we get a and then we fire this event or the opposite of being invisible is visible so when we say not it's just saying the opposite of what what it currently is so if visible is currently false we're gonna set visible to true and if visible is true we're then going to set it to false so let's test this out and we're gonna head up to the brick we're gonna touch it and boom it appears and it says I want to appear when you touch your bricks and my GUI has become visible but then when I jump away from it I'm actually touching it again because I'm touching it again and it fires the remote event but you can see is sort of you know it keeps flashing on the screen and the reason for this is because the brick I can touch it multiple times with multiple body parts so it will fire there are motive en't lots of times and so what it does is it's this code is firing multiple times for each body part so it's going to just keep setting it on and off and on and off so we need to have a cool down so it's not constantly firing this event so we can make a debounce and the debounce just prevents us from firing the show GUI event all the time so it's kind of like a cooldown so you can create our cooldown I'm going to call it D bounce and let's set it to false I'm gonna say if if not D bounce then and then we're gonna say D bounce equals true then we're gonna have our code to check if it's a player and to fire the event we're gonna have a wait two seconds then we're gonna set D bounce to false again so this is a variable and this D bounce and what what we're saying here is if D bounce is false then we're allowed to run this code but if it's true we don't want to run this code so only when D bounce is set to false will we let this code run so when we do let it run we immediately set D bounce to true so it can't be triggered so when this part look touched is triggered again we can't fire the code for a second time and we wait two seconds and then we set D bounce to Fox so we're basically saying that there's a cooldown period of two seconds so you can only step on this brick every two seconds and make it fire the code because we've got all these different body parts here that could be touching the brick at the same time we don't want it to keep turning the GUI on and off really really quickly so if we step on the brick there we go and if we step on it again it's gonna disappear after two seconds actually I might've done something wrong here let's see oh no it seemed that we did it okay I think if we make this anchored and we set can collide to true and we make it look like an actual button here I think that wouldn't be better let's try that wait for it to load and if we step on the brick it appears if we step on it for a second time it disappears so there we go we have just created a part which will make a GUI appear when we click on it and it will also disappear when we click on it again if you didn't want it to disappear when you click on it again you could just set this to true and then have like a wait so after a certain amount of time it will disappear again you can add a line which sets it to follow us afterwards so let's try this one more time so the whole point of using the remote event is because we can't just find the player and disable and turn the GUI on and off from the server scripts because those who enabled which is designed to stop players from changing things on the server basically stops us from being able to access the things are in a player from from a server script so we have to use remote events to communicate between the server and the client so when we step on the brick and the server is actually detecting that but then we have to make a request to the client to show our GUI because the GUI is a managed on the client and this part and the script is managed on the server so the remote event is kind of like the man in the middle and it allows us to to show the GUI when we step on a brick so there we go that's how you make a GUI appear when you step on a brick I hope it was useful if it was please
