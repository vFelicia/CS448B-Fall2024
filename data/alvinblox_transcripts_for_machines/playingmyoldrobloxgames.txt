all right in this video i'm gonna play my old roblox game so these are the games that i was creating before i really knew how to script before i was making videos back when i was like eight years old these are the games that i created i'm going to go through them check them out and you'll be able to see uh what went wrong with them so the first game here that we've got is called obi mania and this game is from 2015 so 27th of january 2015 i would have been like 12 13 years old at this point so this wasn't my first game but this was a game that i knew i was kind of learning scripting at the same time so you see it's got no thumbnail it says it needs to be updated it may not function correctly so let's go in let's see if it still works and yeah let's jump straight in okay so around was already in progress um when i joined because i just told people to join the game so we have people to play with so not the best start but i'll just teach you how the game works so there's loads of hobby courses i like this one this is called wild west and it's basically the first person to reach the end will win and then if everyone dies like they did in this round uh obviously no one wins but we've got this obby here that's a lobby sorry and get my obby and lobby confused this took me ages to build i remember building this and i had to just get this see this little curve for this practice arena i just spent so much time on that and the i'm kind of impressed with the build to be honest i mean there's still a few issues with like the the build here you can see there's a bit of clashing but this is actually quite a good game uh considering i didn't really know how to script at the time this was before i started my youtube channel and everything this was at the start of 2015 so um for like 12 year old me this is actually quite good in my opinion oh gosh look at all these guys we got completely different gui styles the maps aren't even loading uh i bet this would look horrible on a mobile screen and i can't even vote oh my goodness look at these guys oh no everybody fell out the map oh dear this is this ain't going well at all ah everyone's died i mean nobody the game's just gonna carry on for the next 80 seconds so i might as well just show you uh some other things uh so there's a this section up here in the in the lobby was for like vips so you had to buy the gold membership but if you didn't buy it it would kill you which probably isn't the best thing to do considering that you don't want to kill people it's just because they haven't bought your stuff uh we have so we have the inventory i remember this took me ages to create this inventory like i didn't know how to make an inventory and there were so many bugs with it so you bought the items in the shop and then they go in your inventory and you could equip it for when you i don't know if just to use not in the in the lobby i guess but i like the lobby i think the lobby is quite good this is a good idea as well i haven't having the hobby for people to complete whilst around is currently going on but hopefully we can actually load into a map and actually play the game and try to get to the end here uh we'll just use up all of our remaining votes oh i have negative one remaining votes it's already a bug i really didn't know how to make my uh gui scale with the screen here this is not good at all there's a little bit over there that's still working the moving parts so let's give this a go um try and give my best shot on this course there we go and up and up and up all right moving parts i think these are done with c frame uh because there was no tween service back then and to be honest i think i might have just used a free model script whoa how how did i die there i didn't even touch the lava this is a rigged game all right i think you get the idea of how this game works though i'm still quite proud of it i mean i think this game if i just put a little bit more uh time into it now maybe just fixed a couple of things i think this would actually be a good game i could probably release this and make quite a bit of robux from it i actually had to fix a couple of bugs before i even recorded this because the game wouldn't even start so i just had to go into roblox studio and fix a couple of things but there's so many bugs i mean the code is so bad in this game there's like 20 scripts i might even have to show you the inside of this game and show you what it looks like but yeah this was my one of my games not my first it's called obi mania i'll leave a link to it in the description if you want to play it i mean not it will probably it'll probably break on you so please don't give it a dislike but this was made in 2015 when i was 12 years old so not too bad not too bad for someone that still didn't really know how to how to script all right the next game is called skydive paradise now i'm actually quite proud of this game i made it in 2016 so i was 13. i made it after obby mania and this game i'm pretty sure it was like a commission for somebody they wanted to make a skydiving game and then it just broke down like after a couple of weeks but i managed to keep whatever i'd made so far i actually then went on to try and make this into my own game so um i'm going to show you how it works it's basically skydive multiplayer and the first person to reach the finish win so kind of like an obby but skydiving there's no thumbnail no you know it doesn't look like a professional game because i never got around to releasing it but either way it's still fun i'm not sure why it has more dislikes than likes maybe you should go check it out drop a thumbs up to make that equal and this is another game that i think uh can i can remake and could be a popular roblox game if i actually put the time into it so anyway let's go straight into the game and let me show you what it's all about all right so we have a very bad intro gui this game is brought to you by alvin blocks this was created after i made my youtube channel because it was in 2016 but i would have had under a thousand subscribers and it looks like there's a game already in progress so click the play button and you can see already we have a very basic gui style we have a shop where you could buy guns or pets the guns don't do anything though i tried them about five minutes ago and they don't do anything so that's already a book but you can see the round starts and everybody just starts skydiving and the first person to hit the target and i think the the better target you hit so if you hit like the bullseye you'll get more points and then it comes up here in this little gui whoever came first second and third now that gui took me absolutely ages to do like it was a problem i just did not know how to solve like how do you show the people who came first second and third all the time and i just took my agent it was so buggy i remember working on that trying to fix it uh but it seems to be working quite well the skydiving script though this nice little skydiving animation i gotta admit it was a free model uh this this skydiving thing i had no idea how to do it and eventually i just took a free model and that was a that was a problem that was like why this game didn't really go anywhere is because at that time i didn't really know how to edit the skydiving script so i couldn't make anything that was pretty you know advanced or add much onto the game you know there's no real trick to skydiving it's kind of just random who will get there i think it's just if you just aim down then it's whoever's the fastest um will win but apart from that there's not much else you can do in the game which is probably why it wasn't very successful because people would just you know play a couple of rounds and then leave because i mean i gotta admit it's quite boring um it said uh i didn't even say that i i made it in this gui so still quite a few bugs here there you go skydive paradise i kind of learned more from this than like i didn't make any robux or anything or get any uh visits i just learned more about scripting from this game so i'd say that's a win so now i'm going to show you one more game and this game was actually my first one of my first roblox games that i created uh when i was eight years old and it's called fight of dawn now i was looking at the other games that we just played and i was thinking that they were so bad well this game is just gonna be really bad like this is rubbish this just belongs in the trash can because when we go into this game you're just going to see so many free models like this game was created on was it the 7th no the 2nd of july 2011 so i was like eight years old new on roblox was probably just on roadblocks for like three months so i had like no idea how roblox studio works but i thought this game was going to be like the the next big thing on roblox we got a little vip badge vip for fight of dawn i don't even think that even works i don't think i even coded that or did anything with that but here we go and you can see straight away there were so many free models you just oh this game is so bad look at it the creator thanks luongo 100 for using his free model i didn't thank him he just put that in the free model and eightyearold me had no idea how to get rid of that just three models absolutely everywhere um i think the only thing that works in this game is the sword because it's a free model one by roblox and maybe in 2011 everything worked but this game's probably been broken by all the updates and free and uh and filtering enabled and all that stuff so there's not a lot to do here but the aim of the game was that you have two teams you have uk over here you have usa and you just fight each other and whoever wins wins but there's no scripts that control anything there's just a load of npcs i don't even want to show this game off anymore because i frankly i'm getting embarrassed by it here but there you go that was one of my first roblox games fight of dawn i mean let's see if we can actually do anything because someone's joined we got bert dev over here let's see if we can actually go and kill him you can just tell like look at the look at the materials and look at the meshes this just screams out free models i mean if you want to take anything from this game don't use free models in your games because people will just be able to tell uh there's a big cannon over there i want to see what the calendar is before we go now because maybe it will shoot people out of it uh here we go right canon let's see if we can jump into here oh it doesn't do anything f oh no that's it then so there you go there's the probably the earliest roblox game that i that i want to show you um i i guess the the ones that came before that are even more cringy and and embarrassing but it just goes to show that was my first roblox game i'm capable of making much better roblox games now so you just got to keep going keep making more games like i've i've got like over 900 places in my roblox account 900 games so in each one of those would be it would have been an improvement on this one so so yeah you just got to keep going keep improving and then if you go back to your old projects then i'm sure you're going to look at them and think they're really bad but you just got to think of everything that you've learned since you've made those projects so if you enjoyed this video make sure to drop a like subscribe if you're new for roblox scripting videos and development related interesting stuff my name is alvin blocks and i'll catch you in the next one see ya
