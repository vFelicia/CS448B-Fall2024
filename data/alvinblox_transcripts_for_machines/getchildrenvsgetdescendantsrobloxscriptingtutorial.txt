now in roblox an object can be a parent or a child it's either inside of something and it can also have its own children so if an object is a child of something then it means it's inside of something if it's a parent of something then it has something inside of it so a quick example is that this model has four children and they are each these parts so four parts inside of the model four children and two of these parts have a decal inside so these two parts have a child and those children are decals now what is the difference between get children and get descendants so these are both functions that you can call on an instance or an object in roblox studio and they will return a table so when you call them they will create a table so in this case i've called get children on the model what it will do is it will return a table with the children of the model and when i say children i mean things inside of the model and only at the first step so even if you have a decal inside of the parts inside of the model the decal won't count because it's not a child of the model it's actually a child of the part so we're only looking for the children of the model so the things inside of the model at the first step down when i say step down if you have a look here you can see if i just enlarge this image we've got an arrow next to the model right here and just imagine that we're going down a step to this level here okay we were at this level we've gone down a step to this level so only the objects within this level are going to be the children of the model okay so when we call get children it returns a table inside of that table will be the four children or however many children there are of the model or the or the object it doesn't have to be a model that you call get children on it could be any instance objects etc if you run this though it's going to this script i've got it to loop through the table and it's going to print out the name of every object in that table so we've got four parts you can see one two three four there are four children inside of that model now i said earlier that uh calling get children won't will only uh give the children for the first step down from the model now we've got uh a child in each part so a decal in two of these parts uh so the decal is a child of the parts and not the model because uh it's two steps down from the model isn't it one step two steps so the parent of these decals going to be the parts so if you wanted to include every single item inside of the model regardless of what it's parented to as long as it is still inside the model because if you look at these decals they are still a part of the model if you collapse the model you can see they they disappear because they're hidden within the model it's just that because they are children of an object that is a child of the model they aren't included when you call get children on the model so how can you include every single object that is inside this model regardless of what their parent is because you know because this decals parent is apart doesn't mean it's still not part of this model so that's where get descendants comes in if you change this to get descendants like this it's going to return a table again however this time it includes the uh the decal the decals i should say because you look here uh we've got uh two parts if i just enlarge the output here we've got two parts yeah and one of the children of that part is a decal and we've got another part and another part and we've got a decal inside of that part so it just prints out every single item inside of the model you know you could have a decal inside of a decal it will still count as long as it's inside the model that is a descendant because it's it descends from the model it comes from the model uh and if you hide the model you can't see it anymore if you move the model then obviously it's going to move with it etc it's a part of the model so it's a descendant regardless of what its first parent is going to be it is a descendant whereas a child is something that's inside of the model at the first step so these are the four children yes these two parts have their own children but those children are still descendants of the model but they're not included when you call get children whereas if you call get descendants it's going to print out every single instance that is a part of that model regardless of the level of a step when you go down through the explore arrows so thanks for watching i hope that was useful if it was uh drop a like on the video and share it with anyone who you think would benefit from this knowledge so thanks for watching and i'll see you next time
