hello everybody and welcome to this roblox live events tutorial and when it does every single server so keep watching so a lot of people want to know how to add live events into their games and the way they work is by using something called OS dot time so if you were to go into a roblox script and print out OS dot time like this it prints out a number and this number is called the you next time so we can see over here on the right the unix time it's a system for describing a point in time so it could be in the future which is what we want for our live event because we want to pick a time in the future for the event to begin it is the number of seconds that have elapsed so the number of seconds that have gone by since the UNIX epoch or what's that well the UNIX epoch was on at midnight UTC so that's just the standard timezone universal timezone but anyway it happened at midnight UTC time on the first of January 1970 so what they did on the first of January 1970 at midnight they started a stopwatch pretty much and every second ever since the first of January in 1970 at midnight that stopwatch has increased by a second every every second it's gone up by one so obviously since then a lot of seconds have gone by so the time is going to be a big number and you can easily work out what this time is you can you know use OS dot time to find the current time the number of seconds that have passed since January the first in 1970 and you can see if I keep on calling it OS dot time here you'll see that it gets bigger as we get as we go go along every second if I keep doing it it's increasing so OS dot time is just a way in lure of getting the UNIX time since the epoch the epoch was the time when they began the time when was the epoch is the first of January 1970 okay and the unix time is tracking how long it has been since the epoch but it doesn't tell us how long in years or months or days or minutes or hours it tells us how long it's been in seconds so obviously this is a big number as I've told you if you were to put it into Google and divide by 60 to get the number of minutes then divided by divided by 60 again because you need to get the hour then divided by 24 then divide it by 365 you'll get 50 years and guess what 1970 was 50 years ago because you do 20 20 minus 50 1970 so it was 50 point something years that's because it's taking into the month into account as well but what you need to know is that the unix time is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the first of January 1970 and how does this help us with our live event well because it updates every second as we've noticed it gets bigger every second and we we're able to know what this number will be at a certain point in the future right because if we wanted to get the unix time what it will be in ten minutes we just need to add on 600 because 600 seconds is 10 minutes so if I show you this website here it's called epoch converter you can sure there's loads of other websites that do this because this is standard across in your computing and all that we need to pick a time for our live event to begin so I've gone to this website very useful and I'm gonna set the year to be 2020 the month to be 6 for June the day to be the first because it's the first of June today and the hour it's currently 31 minutes past 6 so I'm going to make this the 633 and we'll have zero seconds so it's right on the dot and really important that you I you said a.m. or p.m. in the morning or the evening and then you set GMT you set it to your local time okay so it's going to go by the current time in your time zone so because I'm in the UK and it's 631 this will go off at 633 UK time so in two minutes so I then click on human date to time stamp that will give me the what the unix time will be when it gets to that time so when it gets to 630 three zero seconds the epoch time stamp will the unix time which is currently here so the the time don't forget is the amount of seconds that have passed since January the 1st 1970 and that is going up every single second so this number is the current epoch time and this number here which is the gonna be the epoch time at 633 is larger than this number because it's in the future so what we're gonna do is we're just going to go into our script and the copy this epoch time stamp I'm going to go into my script here so I'm gonna put this as the time to start okay and I'm also going to set the time to stop so when do I want my live event to stop what I want it to stop it 635 I'm gonna get a new time stamp so this time to stop is going to be the time after which say if you joined a new server it would play the live event but when it got to 635 it would no longer play it so now if we join the game it's saying that I've got 12 seconds to go and if we look at our timer well that's true there's only 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 seconds until it is 6 33 and it's saying start the live event so what we've done is we've picked a time in the future and we've got its unix time by converting the time and the human date to a timestamp and that's going to be the number of seconds since that first of January so we can make this our time to start and so we've got OS dot time we've got a while loop and every second with getting the current time so the OS dot time which is going to be this value here then we're checking will just deal with this if statement first we're checking to see if that OS dot time the time right now that number of seconds is greater than our time to start if it is greater than the time to start the moves off obviously exceeded the time which when we wanted to start so because the time to start will be in the future eventually the time now we'll catch up with it and it will become equal to or greater than that time more in it because you know we set our live event to begin at fifteen nine one zero three two seven eight zero and if you look here it's fifty nine 103 to eight so it was if you look at the last five digits it was three two seven eight zero it's now three two eight five four and it increases every second it's just that sometimes when I go out of having the view and I don't keep the window in focus it stops but it will come back down or if you're wondering so every second I'm checking to see if the current number of seconds is greater than the time to start and if it is then we can begin the live event but if it isn't and the time to start is still bigger than the current time we'll just print out how long it is until it is the next live event and a really quick way to find the amount of time until you're live again event begins is by saying time to start time now because if time to start is bigger than the current time and we've not exceeded it yet then if you take away the time now from it you'll have a number of seconds so yeah I'll give you an example so it's 635 let's create a timestamp for 637 so if I take with the timestamp and I just get up my calculator so if I take in this time stand here and we take away the current time which will be smaller right now you can see it's 96 seconds to go and if we were to keep doing this calculation it would eventually come down to zero that is what is going on in the script I forgot to update my time to stop denying let's just make that even further in the future I'll not explain that very soon so here we go so yes 62 seconds now so that's going to count down right because it's just subtracting the current time from that time to start so when the time now which is current always going up every second eventually it will be greater than all the time to start so that will begin the live event so I trigger a function and I break the loop because once the live event has happened we no longer need to be checking for it okay but if you think about it if you open up a new server which is it's past the time to start say the time to start with 733 and you've opened a new server at 735 then it's going to launch the live event straight away and what if you want a cut off time you don't want to show the live event in new servers after a certain time so say the live event happened at 735 and maybe you want it to occur in new servers for five minutes afterwards then you would just set this time to stop to be 740 because it's five minutes in the future that's when after that time live events will no longer play in new servers because we've gone past the live event and it's over now so the time to start it's going to be in the future it will be greater than the OS dot time which is the current number of seconds this epoch time so whenever OS dot time becomes equal to or greater than the time to start we know it's time to begin the event however time to stop will also be in the future but it'll be greater than the time to start value so this is the time at which the live event will no longer be played anymore so if a new server is started up in the future after the live event has played it will no longer play the live event if the time stop hasn't been exceeded so once it has been exceeded it will no longer play the live event in new servers after that time so how do you trigger things to happen when you when your live event happens so I've created a function called live events and I'm calling it when the time now gets greater than the time to start and I can you can do any code in here so if you wanted to launch a rocket for example I could insert a body force into this rocket here so what I've just done I've made some code in this live event function which is going to insert a body force into the rocket and an anchor it and turn on some particle images so it looks like it's blasting off into space we now just need to create our new time to start and time to stop so in the UK it is six forty one sixteen and that's the current time so I'm gonna make this event happen at 642 we're gonna go on human dates to time stamp I'm gonna copy that and put it as our time to start I want the event to no longer be played after 643 so I'm gonna create another time stamp and I'm gonna copy that you see it's 60 seconds ahead of the time to start so let's head in I'm gonna just spawn find my little rocket and let's just clear the output to go to that error from a different script and it is um off the ground a little bit and that's my own fault sorry about that but if we watch now three two one and we should have liftoff and there we go it fires itself into the air and off goes the rocket now I said about that time to stop window right so because you will still be able to see it in new service even though the time the timer has gone past 642 it's still launching itself right every time we open a new server that's because the time to stop will stop us from from launching it in new servers after 643 so we can do it you know as many times as we like as long as the time is is lower than 643 so as soon as it hits 643 on the clock will no longer be able to launch the rocket in a new set but the live event won't play because we're breaking the while loop if the time to stop has been exceeded so let's just go back here and it's about to be 643 so we'll wait for 643 and then we'll open up a new server so here we go you can see 383 80 so now the unix time is greater than this timestamp which ends in 380 which means that if the time now is greater than the time to stop which it is it's just going to break out the while loop it won't even get to this if statement and it won't be able to run the live event so if I go into the game it but it's to launch the rocket but it actually doesn't because the time to stop has been exceeded so the live event will no longer work in new service so that is all you need to know about live events on roblox we're using math sorry OS time to get the current UNIX epoch time which is a universal time used in computing so I'm also using the epoch convert their websites to change a human date into an epoch timestamp and then then using these variables time to start on time to stop to tell the script when I want my live event to begin and I'm having a wild loop which will track every second to see if it's time yet by comparing that os time to the time to start on time to stop values and when that's the current time is greater than that time to start we know it is time to start the live event so I hope that was useful if it was please leave a like and don't forget to subscribe to my channel for more scripting videos why not check out some others I've got loads of interesting videos and an advanced series as well if you're trying to push your knowledge on roblox scripting thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
