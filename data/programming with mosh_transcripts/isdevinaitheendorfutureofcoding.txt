00:00 - everybody is going crazy about Devon in
00:02 - case you haven't heard it claims to be
00:04 - the world's first AI software engineer
00:06 - right now it's still behind closed doors
00:08 - all we have seen is a polished demo but
00:11 - a lot of you are worried that you're
00:12 - going to lose your coding job to Devin
00:14 - some folks are ready to pack up their
00:16 - keyboards and learn Plumbing instead I
00:18 - made a video the other day and shared my
00:20 - thoughts and got a lot of comments in
00:22 - today's video we'll dive deeper and see
00:24 - if Devon will reduce software
00:26 - engineering jobs or is it all hype we'll
00:28 - talk about the reality the potential and
00:31 - most importantly what you can do to stay
00:33 - ahead of the
00:36 - curve all right first question will
00:38 - Devon even succeed startups have a high
00:41 - failure rate even with huge funding
00:43 - investors Chase Trends and AI is hot
00:46 - right now but that doesn't mean that
00:47 - we're going to see a Flawless product
00:49 - that delivers now let's assume for a
00:51 - second that it kicks butt and the
00:53 - official launch blows us away the next
00:56 - question is is it truly useful polish
00:58 - demos are great but really board
01:00 - software is messy it has old systems
01:02 - undocumented quirks tons of Integrations
01:06 - understanding how to work within that
01:07 - that's a kind of thing that AI struggles
01:09 - with and why we need human intelligence
01:11 - and wisdom will Devin work on those real
01:14 - complex Enterprise projects we haven't
01:16 - seen proof of that remember those no
01:19 - code tools that have been around forever
01:21 - all those promises of letting anyone
01:23 - build software with dragon drop magic
01:25 - they often overpromise and underd
01:27 - deliver you can't build anything serious
01:29 - with with these tools certainly not the
01:31 - kind of software that runs our hospitals
01:34 - Airlines or power grids the stuff Our
01:36 - Lives depend on it is our job to create
01:39 - Computing technology such that nobody
01:42 - has to program and that the programming
01:44 - language is human everybody in the world
01:47 - is now a
01:49 - programmer okay hold on let's unpack
01:51 - this nonsense saying no one will need to
01:54 - code and everyone is suddenly a
01:56 - programmer is as ridiculous as claiming
01:58 - with AI every every one is instantly a
02:01 - doctor or a lawyer software engineering
02:03 - just like those fields requires years of
02:06 - specialized training and problem solving
02:08 - skills sure you might create a simple
02:10 - to-do app with natural language but
02:12 - trying to build the software that runs
02:14 - hospitals Airlines or our cars that way
02:16 - it's a massive overpromise so why does
02:18 - he make that bold claim because his
02:20 - company is heavily invested in AI so
02:23 - hyping its power inflates N Video stock
02:26 - so don't fall for it look I respect this
02:28 - Coo's business success but he's not a
02:31 - software engineer keep that in mind he
02:33 - doesn't understand the complexities of
02:35 - real world software and playing around
02:37 - with C+ plus 20 years ago doesn't really
02:39 - count so let's assume that Devin version
02:41 - one or even version 10 can do everything
02:44 - does that mean software jobs suddenly
02:46 - disappear absolutely not take adoption
02:48 - takes time especially in big companies
02:50 - with Legacy systems remember how long it
02:53 - took for companies to fully switch to
02:55 - the cloud it'll be the same with
02:57 - widespread AI adoption this gives you
02:59 - time to learn and adapt let's also
03:01 - remember that take adoption isn't even
03:03 - across the board some companies
03:05 - especially those dealing with sensitive
03:07 - data like government or Healthcare have
03:09 - strict security policies they might even
03:12 - outright Block online AI tools due to
03:14 - security risks so don't assume every
03:17 - workplace will jump on the AI right away
03:20 - think about it digital locks have been
03:21 - around for decades but what happened to
03:23 - locksmiths did they go extend of course
03:26 - not in fact most houses still use
03:28 - traditional keys so just because there's
03:30 - new take out there doesn't mean
03:32 - everybody rushes to adopt it plus some
03:35 - real world systems are so complex and
03:37 - over-engineered that they always need
03:39 - highly specialized Engineers to keep
03:41 - them running think of those banking
03:43 - systems some still rely on Cobalt code
03:46 - from decades ago but regardless of AI as
03:49 - a software engineer you should always be
03:51 - learning new things to stay relevant I
03:53 - remember when foxb was the hottest thing
03:56 - jobs everywhere everybody wanted to
03:57 - learn it and most of you watching this
03:59 - probably haven't even heard of it right
04:01 - then came across SQL Server Oracle
04:04 - different tools but the same concept
04:06 - data storage someone who understands
04:09 - those fundamentals could easily
04:10 - transition from Fox Pro to the next big
04:13 - thing because they grasp the underlying
04:15 - Concepts the fact is the tools we use
04:18 - and how we code will keep evolving
04:20 - that's the nature of tech AI will
04:22 - probably change how we code maybe we'll
04:24 - spend more time crafting prompts and
04:26 - less on coding but we'll still need
04:29 - those deep keep coding skills to refine
04:31 - ai's output and collaborate effectively
04:34 - we still have to understand how code
04:35 - Works how data flows and how to solve
04:38 - real world problems through software
04:40 - these are Timeless skills think of it
04:42 - like building a house you might start
04:44 - with a hammer and nails then learn how
04:46 - to use a power drill and next thing you
04:48 - know you've got fancy 3D modeling
04:50 - software but regardless of the tool you
04:52 - need those blueprints the understanding
04:55 - of structure material lengths and how it
04:57 - all comes together to create a livable
05:00 - space so yes AI will change how we code
05:03 - just like every new takech advancement
05:05 - has done throughout history let's look
05:07 - back for a minute the invention of the
05:09 - calculator didn't eliminate
05:10 - mathematicians it just changed what they
05:12 - spent time on design software didn't
05:15 - erase graphic designers but it certainly
05:17 - changed their workflows the same will
05:19 - happen with coding some very repetitive
05:21 - coding tasks might be automated but
05:23 - guess what happens next new roles emerge
05:26 - now let's address something I hear a lot
05:28 - some of you are worried that AI will
05:30 - make your jobs obsolete that one
05:32 - supercoder with their fancy AI tools
05:35 - will replace two or more Engineers but
05:37 - here's the thing just because we can
05:39 - potentially work faster doesn't mean
05:41 - there's suddenly a shortage of problems
05:43 - to solve think about it we as humans
05:45 - want new features and functionalities
05:47 - all the time every app you use is
05:49 - constantly getting updated why because
05:52 - that's how companies compete they need
05:54 - to offer the best most feature reach
05:56 - experience to stay ahead but it's not
05:58 - just about the the shiny new stuff a lot
06:01 - of existing projects are weighed down by
06:03 - Tech Deb that keeps piling up now
06:05 - imagine AI helping us not only roll out
06:08 - those new features faster but also
06:11 - tackle the messy code companies could
06:13 - finally fix those annoying bugs improve
06:16 - performance all while still delivering
06:18 - the cool stuff that keeps customers
06:20 - happy suddenly projects get done way
06:23 - faster new versions ship like clockwork
06:25 - that means more jobs in the long run not
06:27 - less it's like building a house with
06:30 - better tools and techniques we can build
06:31 - faster but that doesn't mean we suddenly
06:34 - stop needing houses right we just get to
06:36 - build more elaborate and Innovative ones
06:38 - let's not forget the big picture
06:40 - software is eating the world everything
06:42 - runs on some kind of code and that
06:44 - demand is only going to grow we'll
06:46 - always need skilled people to shape that
06:48 - software whether they write every line
06:50 - from scratch or collaborate with
06:52 - powerful AI tools and finally let's not
06:55 - get paralyzed by those clickbait
06:57 - headlines claiming AI is stealing your
06:59 - job those are designed to scare you to
07:01 - get views some are from folks who make
07:03 - money off of your fear others are just
07:06 - inexperienced maybe they know some
07:07 - coding but they don't understand the
07:09 - full complexities of building and
07:11 - maintaining large scale software don't
07:14 - let those voices Define your reality
07:16 - look if you're passionate about coding
07:18 - if the idea of building things with
07:20 - software lights you up then go for it
07:22 - think about it awesome salaries flexible
07:24 - schedules the freedom to work from
07:26 - anywhere these are the perks of being a
07:29 - soft software engineer don't let the
07:31 - fear mongering get to you some folks
07:33 - might get scared of AI and miss out on
07:35 - this amazing path well that's their loss
07:38 - and less competition for you right so
07:40 - instead of getting lost in the Panic
07:42 - focus on leveling up your skills build
07:44 - on those coding fundamentals explore new
07:47 - AI tools and stay hungry for knowledge
07:49 - that's how you thrive not by panicking
