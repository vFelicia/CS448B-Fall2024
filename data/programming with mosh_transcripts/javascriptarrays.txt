00:02 - sometimes in your applications you might
00:05 - be dealing with a list of objects for
00:08 - example the list of products in a
00:10 - shopping cart or the list of colors the
00:13 - user has selected in situations like
00:15 - that you use an array to store that list
00:18 - let me show you how so here I'm gonna
00:21 - declare another variable called selected
00:24 - colors note that I'm using a meaningful
00:27 - name I don't have SC or some other weird
00:31 - name selected colors now we can
00:34 - initialize this and set it to an empty
00:36 - array so these square brackets or what
00:40 - we call array literal and they indicate
00:43 - an empty array now we can initialize
00:46 - this array and add a couple of items
00:49 - like red and blue let's Lock this on the
00:54 - console so console the long selected
00:58 - colors save the changes so here's our
01:01 - array with two elements we can expand
01:04 - that note that each element has an index
01:07 - and that determines the position of that
01:10 - element in the array so the index of the
01:13 - first element is zero and the index of
01:15 - the second element is one so if you want
01:18 - to access an element in an array we use
01:20 - this index here's how for example let's
01:23 - say you want to display the first
01:25 - element in this array you use the square
01:28 - brackets and then specify the index save
01:32 - the changes and now we have red now
01:35 - earlier I told you that JavaScript is a
01:37 - dynamic language so the type of
01:39 - variables can change at runtime the same
01:42 - principle applies to our arrays so the
01:45 - lengths of arrays as well as the type of
01:48 - objects we have in an array are dynamic
01:50 - they can change so aligned - we
01:54 - initialize this array with two elements
01:56 - right now on line 3 we can add another
02:00 - element to this array so the array will
02:02 - expand so let's say selected colors of 2
02:07 - that means the third item in this array
02:09 - is going to be green
02:12 - now let's display this array on the
02:16 - console
02:17 - so we have an array with three elements
02:20 - so the length is dynamic it can change
02:22 - also the type of objects we have in this
02:25 - array is dynamic so unlike other
02:28 - programming languages where every item
02:31 - or every object in the array should have
02:33 - the same type in JavaScript we can store
02:36 - different types in an array so we can
02:39 - make the last element a number save the
02:42 - changes now we have two strings and a
02:45 - number so the objects in the array as
02:47 - well as the size of the array are
02:49 - dynamic now technically an array is an
02:52 - object so just like the personal object
02:54 - we defined in the last lecture it has a
02:57 - bunch of key value pairs or properties
02:59 - that we can access using the dot
03:01 - notation let me prove that to you so
03:03 - here on the console let's look at the
03:05 - type of selected colors so the type of
03:10 - this array is an object so an array is
03:13 - an object in JavaScript so here on line
03:16 - 4 we can look at the properties of this
03:19 - array or this object using the dot
03:21 - notation look these are all the
03:24 - properties defined in arrays in
03:26 - JavaScript so every time we declare an
03:29 - array using square brackets that array
03:32 - will automatically receive these
03:34 - properties we didn't explicitly define
03:36 - them they're just somehow magically
03:39 - inherited from somewhere else we're
03:41 - going to learn about that later when we
03:43 - talk about prototypes now in this
03:45 - lecture we're going to look at one of
03:47 - these properties that is the length
03:49 - property this property returns the
03:52 - number of items or elements in an array
03:55 - so save the changes you can see we have
03:57 - three elements in this array now later
04:00 - in the course we have a comprehensive
04:01 - section about arrays you'll learn about
04:04 - all kinds of operations we can perform
04:06 - on arrays for now all I want you to take
04:09 - away is that an array is a data
04:11 - structure that we use to represent a
04:14 - list of items
04:19 - hi guys thank you for watching my
04:21 - javascript tutorial this tutorial is
04:23 - part of my JavaScript course where you
04:26 - learn all the essential JavaScript
04:28 - features that every web and mobile
04:30 - application developer must know if
04:32 - you're an absolute beginner or have some
04:34 - experience in JavaScript and are looking
04:36 - for a fun and in-depth course that
04:38 - teaches you the fundamentals of
04:40 - JavaScript this course is for you this
04:42 - course is also packed with tons of
04:44 - exercises that help you master what you
04:46 - learned in the course in fact many of
04:48 - these exercises are questions that come
04:51 - up in technical programming interviews
04:53 - so if you're pursuing a job as a
04:55 - front-end or a back-end developer or if
04:58 - you simply want to have a more in-depth
05:00 - understanding of JavaScript I highly
05:02 - encourage you to enroll in the course
05:04 - for a limited time you can get this
05:06 - course with a discount using the link in
