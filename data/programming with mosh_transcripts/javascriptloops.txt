00:03 - sometimes we want to repeat an action a
00:05 - number of times for example let's
00:07 - imagine we want to display hello world
00:09 - five times on the console the poor way
00:12 - of doing that is like this so a console
00:15 - or log hello world and then repeated
00:19 - five times this code is ugly there is a
00:23 - better way to achieve the same result
00:25 - and that's where we use loops in
00:27 - JavaScript we have various kinds of
00:29 - loops and all these loops essentially do
00:32 - the same thing to repeat an action a
00:34 - number of times we have four loops while
00:37 - loops do-while loops 4 in loops and for
00:41 - off loops all these loops essentially do
00:44 - the same thing but there is a subtle
00:46 - difference between how they start and
00:48 - end let's start by looking at the for
00:50 - loop so back to this code this is how we
00:55 - write a for loop so for we add
00:57 - parentheses now here we need three
01:00 - statements the first statement is what
01:03 - we call the initial expression and here
01:06 - we declare and initialize a variable so
01:09 - we use let to declare a variable like I
01:12 - and set it to 0 now I is short for index
01:16 - and is a common convention to use in for
01:19 - loops this is what we call the loop
01:21 - variable so we initialize it to 0 then
01:24 - we terminate this statement with a
01:26 - semicolon now the second part of the for
01:30 - loop is what we call a condition so here
01:33 - we want to add a condition and compare
01:35 - the value of I with something else
01:37 - this loop will run as long as this
01:40 - condition evaluates to true so if you
01:44 - want this look to run 5 times we compare
01:47 - I with 5 so as long as I is less than 5
01:51 - this loop will execute you will see that
01:54 - in a second
01:55 - once again we terminate this statement
01:56 - with a semicolon and finally the third
01:59 - part this is what we call increment
02:02 - expression and quite often what we have
02:05 - here is something like this so we use
02:08 - the increment operator to increment the
02:11 - value of I with 1 now after this for
02:15 - statement we can
02:16 - one or more statements just like the if
02:19 - statements if you have multiple
02:21 - statements here we need to put them in a
02:24 - code block like this now here we want to
02:27 - display hello world on the console so
02:30 - our statement is console that log hello
02:34 - world so instead of repeating this line
02:38 - five times we put it in a for loop and
02:40 - this loop will run five times now save
02:43 - the changes so we get five hello world
02:47 - messages on the console alright now that
02:49 - you have seen a for loop in action let's
02:52 - see exactly how this loop works so
02:55 - earlier I told you this is what we call
02:56 - an initial expression here we are
02:59 - initializing I to 0 now this loop will
03:02 - execute as long as this condition is
03:05 - true so as long as I is less than 5 the
03:09 - statements we have here will be executed
03:11 - now after the first iteration I is
03:15 - incremented by 1 then this condition is
03:19 - evaluated again so 1 is less than 5 so
03:22 - one more time this loop is executed so
03:25 - we have the second iteration now after
03:28 - the second iteration once again is
03:30 - incremented by 1 so now we are in the
03:33 - third iteration again this condition is
03:36 - evaluated and because it is true the
03:38 - loop is executed to show you this in
03:41 - action I'm gonna output I on the console
03:44 - so save the changes this is what we get
03:49 - so note that in the first iteration I is
03:52 - 0 then is incremented by 1 until it
03:55 - reaches 4 so at the end of fifth
03:58 - iteration I will before and when we
04:01 - increment that by 1 it will be 5 so this
04:04 - condition will evaluate to false so
04:07 - essentially there are two ways to repeat
04:10 - an action a number of times using the
04:12 - for loop let's say we want to repeat
04:14 - something 5 times we can initialize I to
04:17 - 0 and check to see if it's less than 5
04:20 - alternatively we can initialize this to
04:23 - 1 and check to see if it's less than or
04:26 - equal to 5 now if you save the changes
04:29 - we
04:30 - see I starts from one and finishes at
04:34 - five now we can make this program a bit
04:36 - more interesting let's say we want to
04:38 - display the odd numbers between one to
04:41 - five so instead of log in hello world on
04:43 - the console we can have an if statement
04:46 - and check the remainder of the division
04:50 - of I by two so if the remainder of
04:54 - division of I by 2 is not 0 that means I
04:59 - is an odd number so we can display it on
05:03 - the console save the changes so here are
05:07 - the odd numbers between 1 to 5 there is
05:11 - also another way to write this loop
05:13 - instead of starting from 1 and going all
05:15 - the way up to 5 we can start from 5 and
05:18 - go back to 1 so we change the initial
05:20 - expression set I to 5 as long as I is
05:25 - greater than or equal to 1 now we want
05:30 - to determine I save the changes now we
05:34 - get the odd numbers in the reverse order
05:36 - it's more common to use the previous
05:39 - form so we initialize I to 0 or 1 and
05:42 - increment it in every iteration but in
05:45 - certain problems you want to use a for
05:47 - loop in the reverse order
