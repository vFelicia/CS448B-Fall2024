00:02 - in the category of reference types you
00:05 - have learned about objects and arrays
00:07 - now let's take a look at functions
00:09 - functions are one of the fundamental
00:12 - building blocks in JavaScript a function
00:15 - is basically a set of statements that
00:17 - performs a task or calculates a value
00:20 - let me show you a couple of examples so
00:23 - I'm going to declare a function using
00:25 - the function keyword now we need to give
00:28 - it a name let's call that greet after
00:30 - that we need to add parentheses that's
00:33 - part of the syntax for declaring
00:34 - functions and then curly braces now what
00:38 - we have here inside the curly braces is
00:41 - what we refer to as the body of this
00:44 - function and this is where we add all
00:46 - these statements to define some kind of
00:48 - logic in our application for example the
00:52 - logic for this function should be to
00:54 - display a message on the console so here
00:57 - we can add console the log hello world
01:02 - now note that here we have a statement
01:06 - so we terminated with a semicolon but
01:09 - when we are declaring a function we
01:11 - don't need to add semicolon at the end
01:13 - because we are not declaring it like a
01:15 - variable like this okay this is a
01:19 - function declaration right so now we
01:23 - have a function we can call this
01:25 - function like this so we add the name of
01:28 - the function and parentheses again and
01:30 - then semicolon to indicate that this is
01:34 - a statement save the changes now we have
01:37 - hello world on the console but that's
01:39 - pretty boring what would we do this let
01:41 - me show you how to make this more
01:42 - interesting our functions can have
01:44 - inputs and these inputs can change how
01:48 - the function behaves so let's say
01:51 - instead of displaying hello world we
01:53 - want to display the name of the person
01:56 - here like hello John so we can add a
02:00 - variable here in between parentheses we
02:04 - refer to this variable as a parameter
02:06 - so this greet function has one parameter
02:09 - called name and essentially name is like
02:12 - a variable that is only meaningful
02:15 - inside
02:16 - dysfunction so inside of this function
02:18 - we can work with this name variable but
02:20 - it will not be accessible outside of
02:23 - this function the name is an input to
02:26 - this function so instead of displaying
02:28 - hello world we can display hello
02:31 - then add a plus here to concatenate two
02:34 - strings so we can add name after now
02:39 - when calling the great function we need
02:42 - to pass a value for the name variable or
02:45 - name parameter more accurately so we can
02:49 - pass John here now we refer to this as
02:52 - an argument so John is an argument to
02:56 - the greet function a name is a parameter
03:00 - of the greet function it's one of the
03:02 - things that a lot of programmers don't
03:04 - know they don't know the difference
03:05 - between a parameter and an argument so a
03:08 - parameter is what we have here at the
03:10 - time of declaration but the argument is
03:13 - the actual value with supply for that
03:16 - parameter okay
03:17 - now let's save the changes so we have
03:20 - hello John now we can reuse this
03:23 - function but with a different input so
03:26 - we can copy this line here and change on
03:30 - to Mary save the changes now we have two
03:33 - different messages on the console now a
03:36 - function can have multiple parameters so
03:39 - here we can separate parameters using a
03:41 - comma so let's add another parameter
03:44 - like last name now we can change our
03:48 - console not blog add a space here and
03:52 - then display the last name now when
03:57 - calling this greet function we should
03:59 - pass another argument for the last name
04:01 - right but let's see what happens if we
04:03 - don't do this so I'm gonna save the
04:05 - changes see what we got
04:08 - hello John undefined because as I told
04:11 - you before the default value of
04:13 - variables in JavaScript is undefined so
04:16 - because we did not pass a value for the
04:19 - last name by default it's undefined so
04:23 - I'm gonna pass another argument here we
04:26 - separate them using a comma John Smith
04:30 - and we don't need the second call to the
04:31 - greet function save the changes now we
04:35 - have hello John Smith
04:40 - hi guys thank you for watching my

04:54 - you're an absolute beginner or have some
04:56 - experience in JavaScript and are looking
