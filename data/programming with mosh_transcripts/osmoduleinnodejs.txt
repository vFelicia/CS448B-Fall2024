00:01 - in this lecture I'm going to show you
00:03 - how to get information about the current
00:05 - operating system so back in no
00:07 - documentation in the list of modules if
00:10 - you scroll down you can see it's OS
00:13 - module let's have a quick look here so
00:16 - these are the methods that are available
00:18 - in this module for example we have free
00:21 - mem which returns the amount of free
00:23 - memory on this machine we also have
00:25 - total mem which is the total memory we
00:28 - can get information about the current
00:30 - user we can get the uptime of this
00:32 - machine and so on so let's use a couple
00:35 - of these methods here so if you scroll
00:38 - down you can see this is how we load
00:40 - this OS module just like loading other
00:43 - modules we call the require function and
00:45 - store the result in a constant called OS
00:48 - or anything
00:49 - so back in vs code I'm gonna delete all
00:52 - the code here and define a new constant
00:55 - OS and study to require OS now we can
01:01 - call total mem method
01:05 - or free mem or other methods so let me
01:10 - declare a variable and store the result
01:13 - here
01:16 - and similarly for the free memory free
01:19 - memory and finally let's lock these
01:22 - values on the console so console dot log
01:27 - single code we add total memory and
01:32 - append this total memory here now we can
01:37 - simplify this expression by using a
01:40 - template string which is available in
01:43 - more recent versions of JavaScript that
01:46 - we refer to as es6 or ES 2015 which is
01:52 - short for ACMA script 6 or 2015 that's
01:57 - the specification that defines what
01:59 - features are available in JavaScript so
02:02 - every year akima defines new features
02:04 - that should be added to JavaScript and
02:06 - as you know different browsers implement
02:09 - different set of these features but the
02:11 - v8 engine that we have inside of node
02:14 - that's pretty up-to-date and it
02:16 - implements a lot of new features of
02:18 - JavaScript that is defined in Eggman
02:21 - script so in Eggman script six or eight
02:24 - most script 2015 we have a feature
02:26 - called template string which helps us
02:29 - build a string without concatenations
02:32 - let me show you how that works so
02:35 - console dot log now instead of a single
02:39 - quote we use the backtick character
02:43 - backtick is the character before number
02:46 - one on your keyboard so here we add some
02:48 - static text like total memory now we
02:53 - want to add something here dynamically
02:55 - so we use dollar sign and curly braces
02:59 - to add a placeholder for an argument in
03:03 - this case our argument is this total
03:06 - memory variable so we can see with a
03:09 - template string we don't have
03:11 - concatenation okay now I'm gonna
03:14 - duplicate this line and change total to
03:18 - free and here let's add free memory okay
03:23 - now we don't need this first console log
03:26 - we're done with this let's go back to
03:28 - the terminal
03:29 - and run this app
03:31 - so note app but Jas and you can see the
03:35 - total and free memory on my machine now
03:38 - what is interesting here is that before
03:40 - note we could not get this kind of
03:42 - information using javascript javascript
03:45 - used to run only inside of a browser and
03:47 - we could only work with the window or
03:49 - document objects we couldn't get
03:51 - information about the operating system
03:53 - but when using node or javascript code
03:56 - is executed outside of a browser or as
03:59 - some people say on the server with this
04:02 - we can get information about the
04:04 - operating system we can work with files
04:06 - we can work with the network for example
04:08 - we can build a web server that listens
04:10 - for HTTP requests on a given port and
04:13 - I'm gonna show you all this later in
04:15 - this section
04:18 - hi guys its mosh here thank you for
04:20 - watching my know tutorial I just wanted
04:23 - to let you know that this video you've
04:24 - been watching it's part of my complete
04:26 - note course where you will learn
04:28 - everything about node from the basic to
04:30 - the advanced topics if you're serious
04:32 - about learning node I highly recommend
04:34 - you to enroll in my node course because
04:36 - this is much faster than jumping from
04:39 - one tutorial to another it saves you
04:40 - time plus you're going to get a lot of
04:43 - exercises that will prepare you for the
04:45 - real work and also at the end of the
04:47 - course you'll receive a certificate of
04:49 - completion that you can provide your
04:51 - current or future employer so if you
04:54 - want to enroll click on the link in the
04:56 - video description I hope to see you in
04:58 - the course
