00:03 - let's start this section by a discussion
00:05 - of variables which are one of the core
00:07 - concepts in programming we use variables
00:10 - to store data in computer's memory here
00:13 - are a few examples I'm going to define a
00:15 - variable called students under line
00:18 - count and setting it to a thousand when
00:22 - we run this program python interpreter
00:24 - will allocate some memory and store this
00:27 - number thousand in that memory space
00:29 - then it will have this variable
00:32 - reference that memory location so this
00:36 - variable is just like a label for that
00:38 - memory location we can use this variable
00:40 - or this label anywhere in our program to
00:43 - get access to that memory location and
00:45 - the data is stored there so now if we
00:48 - print students count and run our program
00:53 - we will get the number of thousand so
00:57 - this is the basic of variables now what
01:00 - kind of data can be a store in
01:01 - computer's memory well we have several
01:04 - different kinds of data in this section
01:06 - we're going to look at the built-in
01:08 - primitive types in Python primitive
01:11 - types can be numbers boolean and strings
01:15 - let me show you so here we have a whole
01:18 - number we refer to this as an integer in
01:21 - programming we can also have numbers
01:23 - with a decimal point let's take a look
01:25 - so rating we set this to four point nine
01:29 - nine this is what we call a float or a
01:32 - floating-point number and this
01:34 - terminology is not specific to Python in
01:36 - the future when you learn a new
01:38 - programming language you're going to
01:40 - hear these terms again now let's take a
01:42 - look at an example of a boolean is
01:45 - published we set this to true or false
01:51 - these are examples of boolean values in
01:54 - programming so boolean values can either
01:56 - be true or false and these are exactly
02:00 - like yes and no in English later in the
02:02 - course you will learn that will use
02:04 - these boolean values to make decisions
02:06 - in our programs for example if the user
02:09 - is an admin user perhaps we want to give
02:12 - them extra
02:13 - permissions so these are the boolean
02:15 - values now take into account that Python
02:18 - is a case sensitive language which means
02:21 - lower case and upper case characters
02:23 - have different meanings so boolean
02:25 - values should always start with a
02:28 - capital letter like what you see here if
02:30 - we type false or false these are not
02:34 - accepted boolean values in Python only
02:36 - what you see here is a valid boolean
02:38 - value so false or true and finally let's
02:42 - take a look at an example of a string so
02:45 - course under line name we set this to
02:48 - your string like Python programming so
02:51 - string as I told you before is like text
02:54 - whenever you want to work with text in
02:56 - your programs you need to surround your
02:58 - text with quotes so these are the basics
03:01 - of variables
03:09 - so these are the variables from the last
03:11 - lecture now I've got a question for you
03:14 - there are four things that have
03:15 - consistently used in this program can
03:18 - you spot them if you want you can pause
03:20 - the video think about this for a few
03:22 - seconds and then continue watching
03:25 - so here are those four things the first
03:28 - thing is that all my variable names are
03:30 - descriptive and meaningful so students
03:34 - count represents the number of students
03:36 - for a course or course name clearly
03:39 - explains that this variable holds the
03:41 - name of a course one of the issues that
03:43 - I see a lot amongst beginner programmers
03:46 - is that they use mystical names for
03:49 - their variables something like this see
03:52 - n as in short for course name when
03:54 - someone else reads this code they have
03:56 - no idea what CN stands for or they use
03:59 - variable names like c1 when I look at
04:02 - that code I wonder where you see two and
04:04 - what is the difference between c1 and c2
04:07 - so these variable names are very
04:09 - mystical that's a bad practice
04:11 - make sure your variable names are always
04:13 - descriptive and meaningful because this
04:16 - makes your code more maintainable now
04:19 - there are times that you can use short
04:21 - variable names like X Y Z if you're
04:24 - dealing with things like coordinates so
04:27 - that's an exception now the second thing
04:30 - that I have consistently used in this
04:32 - code is that I have used lowercase
04:34 - letters to name my variables so here we
04:37 - don't have course name all in capital or
04:41 - in title case all letters are lowercase
04:45 - right let's delete this the third thing
04:49 - that I've consistently used here is that
04:52 - I have used an underscore to separate
04:54 - multiple words and I've done this to
04:57 - make my variable names more readable
04:59 - because in Python we cannot have a space
05:02 - in variable names so we cannot have
05:04 - course name and if you put these two
05:06 - words together it's a little bit hard to
05:08 - read that's why we use an underscore and
05:11 - the fourth thing that I have used
05:13 - consistently here is that I have put a
05:15 - space around this equal sign again
05:19 - that's one of the issues I see a lot
05:21 - amongst beginners they write code like
05:24 - this this is a little bit ugly this is
05:27 - what we call dirty code dirty stinky
05:31 - smelly
05:32 - you should write code that is clean and
05:33 - beautiful so other people can read it
05:36 - like a story like a newspaper are
05:39 - you should be formatted properly and
05:41 - that's why we have Pep 8 in Python now
05:45 - the good thing is if you forget these
05:46 - rules when you save the changes auto pay
05:49 - paid kicks in I didn't automatically
05:51 - reformat your code but that aside you
05:53 - should always give yourself the habit of
05:55 - writing clean code without relying too
05:58 - much on the tooling so these are all the
06:01 - best practices about naming your
06:03 - variables next we're going to look at
06:05 - strings in more detail
