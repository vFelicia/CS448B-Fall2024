00:00 - I see a lot of my students try to learn
00:02 - many unrelated programming languages at
00:04 - the same time they learn a bit of C++
00:06 - while learning JavaScript and Python and
00:09 - after applying for a 100 jobs with no
00:11 - response they get frustrated and wonder
00:14 - what's going wrong so in this video I'm
00:16 - going to talk about why trying to learn
00:18 - many unrelated languages is a recipe for
00:20 - failure and what you should focus on
00:25 - instead look each of these languages has
00:27 - certain strengths and is often used for
00:30 - a specific kind of job in the tech world
00:32 - for example C++ is a powerful beast when
00:35 - it comes to building amazing games or
00:37 - controlling physical objects like
00:39 - SmartWatches self-driving cars and all
00:42 - the cool gadgets on the other hand
00:44 - JavaScript is all about making websites
00:46 - interactive and dynamic two completely
00:49 - different worlds and specializations so
00:52 - someone learning JavaScript and C++ at
00:54 - the same time it's like someone trying
00:56 - to become a dentist and a heart surgeon
00:58 - at the same time you wouldn't get hired
01:00 - as a dentist or a heart surgeon if you
01:02 - only know a little bit of each right the
01:05 - same goes for coding getting a software
01:07 - engineering job isn't about how many
01:09 - programming languages you know it's
01:10 - about what you can do or what you can
01:12 - build let's be realistic if you only
01:14 - know bits of JavaScript and C++ you
01:17 - can't build either a game or a website
01:20 - these are two different career paths and
01:22 - each requires more than just the core
01:24 - language for games you'll need C++ as
01:27 - well as a game engine like Unreal Engine
01:30 - plus other skills in graphics and game
01:32 - design and for creating awesome websites
01:34 - you'll need HTML CSS JavaScript a UI
01:38 - toolkit like react angular and so on so
01:41 - do yourself a favor stop trying to learn
01:43 - everything at once if you want that
01:45 - coding job you have to focus on one
01:47 - language at a time and then learn the
01:49 - other tools and technologies that go
01:51 - with it so you can build something that
01:53 - employers will actually care about I've
01:56 - made a short and practical video where I
01:58 - break down exactly Which languages are
02:01 - best for different takech jobs it gives
02:03 - you a super clear Direction check out
02:05 - the link in the description box below
02:07 - and hey if this video helped you gain
02:09 - Clarity give it a like And subscribe for
02:11 - more awesome coding content thanks for
02:13 - watching
