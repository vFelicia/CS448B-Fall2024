00:00 - In this video, I'm going to answer the top 3 questions
00:04 - my students ask me about Python. What is Python? What 
00:08 - can you do with it? And why is it so popular? In other words, what
00:12 - does it do that other programming languages don't? Python is the 
00:16 - world's fastest growing and most popular programming language, not just 
00:20 - amongst software engineers, but also amongst mathematicians, 
00:24 - data analysts, scientists, accountants, networking engineers,
00:28 - and even kids! Because it's a very beginner friendly programming 
00:32 - language. So people from different disciplines use Python
00:36 - for a variety of different tasks, such as data analysis and visualization, 
00:40 - artificial intelligence and machine learning, automation 
00:44 - in fact this is one of the big uses of Python amongst people who are not software
00:48 - developers. If you constantly have to do boring, repetitive 
00:52 - tasks, such as copying files and folders around, renaming them, 
00:56 - uploading them to a server, you can easily write a Python script to
01:00 - automate all that and save your time. And that's just one example, if you
01:04 - continuously have to work with excel spreadsheets, PDF's, CS
01:08 - View files, download websites and parse them, you can automate all
01:12 - that stuff with Python. So you don't have to be a software developer to use Python.
01:16 - You could be an accountant, a mathematician, or a scientist, and use Python 
01:20 - to make your life easier. You can also use Python to build 
01:24 - web, mobile and desktop applications as well as software 
01:28 - testing or even hacking. So Python is a multi purpose language. 
01:32 - Now if you have some programming experience you may say, "But Mosh
01:36 - we can do all this stuff with other programming languages, so what's the big deal 
01:40 - about Python?" Here are a few reasons. With Python you can 
01:44 - solve complex problems in less time with fewer lines of code. 
01:48 - Here's an example. Let's say we want to extract the first three 
01:52 - letters of the text Hello World. This is the code we have to write 
01:56 - in C# this is how we do it in JavaScript and here's how we 
02:00 - do it in Python. See how short and clean the language is?
02:04 - And that's just the beginning. Python makes a lot of trivial things
02:08 - really easy with a simple yet powerful syntax. Here are a few
02:12 - other reasons Python is so popular. It's a high level language
02:16 - so you don't have to worry about complex tasks such as memory management, 
02:20 - like you do in C++. It's cross platform which means 
02:24 - you can build and run Python applications on Windows, Mac, 
02:28 - and Linux. It has a huge community so whenever you get 
02:32 - stuck, there is someone out there to help. It has a large ecosystem 
02:36 - of libraries, frameworks and tools which means whatever you wanna do
02:40 - it is likely that someone else has done it before because Python has been around 
02:44 - for over 20 years. So in a nutshell, Python
02:48 - is a multi-purpose language with a simple, clean, and beginner-friendly 
02:52 - syntax. All of that means Python is awesome.
02:56 - Technically everything you do with Python you can do with other programming languages, 
03:00 - but Python's simplicity and elegance has made it grow way 
03:04 - more than other programming languages. That's why it's the number onne
03:08 - language employers are looking for. So whether you're a programmer or 
03:12 - an absolute beginner, learning Python opens up lots of job opportunities 
03:16 - to you. In fact, the average Python developer earns a whopping
03:20 - 116,000 dollars a year. If you
03:24 - found this video helpful, please support my hard work by liking and sharing it with others. 
03:28 - Also, be sure to subscribe to my channel, because I have a couple of
03:32 - awesome Python tutorials for you, you're going to see them on the screen now. 
03:36 - Here's my Python tutorial for beginners, it's a great starting point if you 
03:40 - have limited or no programming experience. On the other hand, if you 
03:44 - do have some programming experience and want to quickly get up to speed with Python, 
03:48 - I have another tutorial just for you. I'm not going to waste your time 
03:52 - telling you what a variable or a function is. I will talk to you like a programmer.
