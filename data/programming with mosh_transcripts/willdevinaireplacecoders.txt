00:00 - did you hear the news a new AI called
00:02 - Devin just came out as the world's first
00:04 - AI software engineer now they say it can
00:07 - code entire projects take freelancing
00:10 - jobs on upwork fix GitHub issues and
00:13 - even deploy code on its own so the
00:15 - headlines are screaming that software
00:17 - engineering jobs are dead and people are
00:20 - asking me oh msh I'm in the first year
00:22 - of computer science or I just graduated
00:25 - so didn't waste my time but here's the
00:27 - thing I've been in the industry for 20
00:29 - years and trust me we're going to be
00:31 - just fine in this video I'm going to
00:33 - give you five reasons why I'm not
00:35 - panicking and why I think you shouldn't
00:37 - worry either let's dive into the
00:41 - details let's be honest companies that
00:44 - build these AI tools they are in the
00:46 - business of selling they're going to
00:48 - show you the coolest Parts the most
00:50 - impressive demos to get you excited but
00:52 - just like every product there are
00:54 - usually limitations we only discover
00:57 - after we start using it Devin may have
00:59 - done some upw work jobs but what kind of
01:01 - jobs simple complex we just don't know
01:04 - yet these demos are meant to grab your
01:06 - attention and attract new investors keep
01:09 - that in mind now let's be real even if
01:12 - Devon is a coding Superstar do you think
01:14 - any serious company is going to let an
01:17 - AI pick up their sensitive code base
01:19 - generate changes and just automatically
01:21 - deploy it absolutely not that's a recipe
01:24 - for disaster a human software engineer
01:27 - always needs to review the ai's work
01:30 - trust me I've played with a lot of these
01:32 - tools and they are not perfect it's like
01:34 - self-driving cars cool technology but we
01:36 - are not getting rid of drivers anytime
01:38 - soon now speaking of reviewing have you
01:41 - heard of the term AI hallucination it's
01:44 - like that friend who always seems to
01:45 - have an answer for everything even if
01:47 - they don't know what they're talking
01:48 - about AI can do that with code spitting
01:51 - out something that looks impressive but
01:53 - doesn't actually solve the problem
01:55 - that's where we humans still coming now
01:58 - think about this chat GPT has been
02:00 - around for a year and a half and it can
02:02 - generate code how many stories have you
02:04 - read about software Engineers losing
02:07 - their jobs because their company decided
02:09 - to use an AI instead I haven't heard of
02:11 - a single story and here's the reason
02:13 - building great software is about way
02:15 - more than just typing out code think
02:18 - about it this way making a movie isn't
02:20 - just about the actors on screen there's
02:22 - writing directing editing lighting sound
02:26 - design tons of behindth scenes work that
02:28 - the audience never SE directly same with
02:31 - software yes AI getting better at code
02:34 - generation is cool and important but
02:37 - it's like improving the acting part of
02:39 - the equation there is still a whole
02:41 - world of essential skills AI hasn't
02:43 - touched yet can an AI sit down with a
02:45 - client and figure out what they truly
02:47 - need the way a human can I don't think
02:50 - so also so many businesses rely on older
02:53 - often complex systems understanding how
02:56 - they work their constraints and how to
02:58 - integrate them with newer technology
03:01 - that takes Human Experience and problem
03:03 - solving skills that AI hasn't mastered
03:05 - yet planning the big pieces of how your
03:08 - software works and overall user
03:10 - experience that's an art form that AI
03:12 - has barely touched so much of our job is
03:14 - talking to other Engineers designers
03:16 - stakeholders figuring out Solutions
03:19 - together AI can't replace that human
03:22 - interaction look I've been coding for 30
03:24 - years and I've seen the tools change so
03:26 - much here's the first editor I used on a
03:29 - com 64 to code that was 35 years ago
03:33 - back then it was just you and the text
03:35 - character by character no fancy features
03:38 - just pure focus on the logic then came
03:40 - editors like visual studio with auto
03:42 - completion that was a GameChanger fast
03:45 - forward a few years and we got code
03:47 - Snippets with a few key strokes you
03:49 - could generate a whole chunk of code
03:51 - amazing for efficiency and now with
03:53 - GitHub co-pilot and other AI tools we
03:56 - can explain what we want in plain
03:58 - English and it generates Cod pretty
04:01 - impressive right but here's the key
04:03 - point the trend is that we spend less
04:05 - time on the boring repetitive typing
04:08 - stuff and more time on the creative and
04:10 - strategic parts of software development
04:13 - that's where humans Excel oh and by the
04:15 - way let's not forget that 3 years ago
04:18 - when GitHub co-pilot first came out
04:20 - there was a similar hype a fear that it
04:22 - would replace developers but the reality
04:25 - it's being a productivity booster not a
04:27 - job stealer so my advice Don't Panic
04:30 - ignore the clickbait headlines keep
04:32 - learning keep growing your skills and
04:34 - trust that if AI gets so good that even
04:37 - experienced software Engineers are't
04:39 - needed well it won't just affect us the
04:42 - whole world would be changing not just
04:44 - coding let me know what you think in the
04:46 - comments and subscribe for more videos
04:48 - like
