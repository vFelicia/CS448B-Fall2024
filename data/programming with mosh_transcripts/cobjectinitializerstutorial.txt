00:00 - Oh
00:03 - okay object initializers in the last
00:06 - lecture we learned about constructors
00:07 - you know that we use a constructor to
00:10 - initialize an object and put it in an
00:12 - early State in c-sharp there is also
00:14 - another way to initialize an object and
00:16 - that is using an object initializer an
00:19 - object initializer is simply as syntax
00:22 - or quickly initializing an object
00:24 - without the need to call one of its
00:26 - constructors what do you need that
00:28 - simply to avoid creating multiple
00:31 - constructors let me show you an example
00:36 - imagine we have this person class with a
00:38 - bunch of fields now this is a very
00:40 - simple example we only have four fields
00:42 - here in a real world application you
00:44 - might have a few more fields now with
00:46 - this class if you want to create
00:48 - constructors for initializing various
00:50 - fields we may end up with a class like
00:52 - this
00:55 - as you see here I have four constructors
00:56 - the first one takes only an ID the
00:59 - second one takes an ID and a first name
01:01 - the third one takes an ID with first
01:04 - name and last name and so on so you see
01:06 - there are so many different combinations
01:07 - and this is what we used to do in
01:09 - c-sharp before object initializers were
01:11 - introduced so as you see writing code
01:14 - like that is messy and easily becomes
01:16 - out of control so object initializer
01:18 - came to solve this problem with an
01:21 - object initializer we don't need any of
01:23 - these constructors we can simply
01:25 - initialize a person object like this
01:29 - no these curly braces here I'm not
01:32 - calling one of the constructors of the
01:33 - person class
01:36 - you see here is what we call object
01:38 - initialization syntax so basically you
01:41 - specify the name of properties and
01:42 - assign them some initial value
01:45 - note that behind a scene when you
01:47 - initialize an object like this the
01:49 - default or parameterless constructor is
01:51 - going to be called and then any
01:53 - properties you set here are going to be
01:55 - initialized so with this way we can
01:58 - reserve constructors for scenarios where
02:00 - we really need to use them as I
02:01 - explained in the last lecture so an
02:03 - object cannot behave without being
02:06 - passed some initial values
02:08 - that's pretty much what you need to know
02:10 - about object initialization syntax in
02:12 - the next lecture we'll take a closer
02:14 - look at our methods and their parameters
02:15 - I hope you enjoyed this lecture and
02:17 - thank you for watching
02:21 - hi guys ma chere I hope you're having a
02:24 - fantastic day or night wherever you are
02:27 - in the world this tutorial you have been
02:29 - watching is actually part of one of my C
02:31 - sharp courses where you will learn
02:33 - everything about classes interfaces and
02:36 - object-oriented programming in case
02:39 - you're interested to enroll in the full
02:40 - course I've put the link for you in the
02:43 - video description and if not that's
02:45 - perfectly fine
02:45 - have a great day
