00:00 - meet Luke back in 2020 he set a crazy
00:03 - goal build a website with a million
00:05 - visitors a month guess what he crushed
00:07 - it but then disaster suddenly his
00:10 - traffic was tanking this isn't just
00:12 - about Luke many website owners been
00:14 - facing the same problem they worked so
00:17 - hard on their websites created amazing
00:19 - content and then starting in January of
00:22 - 2023 they saw their visitors slowly
00:25 - disappear it can be really frustrating
00:27 - so I was curious and started reading com
00:30 - comments people are blaming it on all
00:32 - sorts of things Google's changing
00:33 - algorithms bad content technical
00:36 - problems the usual stuff you always here
00:39 - now I'm not going to pretend to be an
00:40 - SEO expert and I'm not sure what exactly
00:43 - happened with Luke's website but there
00:45 - is something interesting about all these
00:47 - stories of website traffic suddenly
00:49 - dropping the problem seem to pop up
00:52 - around January of 20123 that's roughly
00:55 - when chat GPT went totally viral think
00:58 - about how you search for things now I
01:00 - personally much prefer asking chat GPT a
01:03 - question and getting a straight answer
01:05 - instead of the whole Google search dance
01:07 - you know clicking links dealing with a
01:09 - million ads popping up from every corner
01:12 - and scrolling through articles that
01:14 - sometimes take forever to get to the
01:16 - point so I think that could be a big
01:18 - reason why website traffic has dropped
01:20 - for so many people so out of curiosity I
01:23 - ran a poll on YouTube Twitter and
01:25 - Linkedin and guess what the results were
01:27 - super interesting on YouTube 61% of you
01:31 - still use Google more while 39% use chat
01:34 - GPT more over on Twitter 45% go with
01:38 - Google while 54% prefer chat jpt and on
01:42 - LinkedIn 59% of you use chat jpt more
01:45 - often Google's usage seems to have
01:47 - dropped to about 41% here's the main
01:50 - point across all these platforms a lot
01:53 - of people are using chat GPT very often
01:55 - sometimes even more than Google this
01:57 - could be a big reason why so many
01:59 - websites have seen their traffic drop
02:01 - since January of 2023 if people are
02:04 - getting answers directly from chat jpt
02:07 - they may not need to click through to
02:09 - websites as often and that brings us to
02:11 - an interesting question does this mean
02:13 - blogin is dead if people can get their
02:15 - answers so easily from chat GPT why
02:18 - bother with the whole process of writing
02:20 - articles or blog posts but here's
02:22 - something to think about AI tools like
02:24 - chat jpt learn by reading lots of text
02:28 - if you stop writing blogs what will they
02:30 - learn from how will they know about new
02:32 - things happening in the world so what do
02:34 - you think will blocks disappear or is
02:37 - there a new way of websites and AI to
02:39 - work together I want to hear your ideas
02:42 - so let's talk about it in the comments
