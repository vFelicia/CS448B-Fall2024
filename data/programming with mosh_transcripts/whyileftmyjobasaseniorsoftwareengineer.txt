00:00 - hey guys Masha today I want to share a
00:03 - powerful story with you I just sent out
00:05 - a survey asking my students to tell me
00:07 - what courses they want me to create for
00:09 - them in 2020 as I was reading the
00:11 - responses I came across this message
00:13 - thank you sir you have changed my life
00:15 - I'm a software engineer when I joined
00:17 - this company I came to know that all
00:20 - development are done in react but I was
00:22 - a big zero on this then almost four
00:24 - months how did I spent only I know I got
00:28 - frustrated and ready to quit the job
00:30 - then I found your lectures on react I
00:33 - started watching on YouTube and then I
00:35 - subscribed the full course it was the
00:37 - turning point of my life and now with
00:38 - grace I'm one of the senior developers
00:40 - in my team it developed almost five to
00:43 - six apps on react for KY OS platform
00:46 - like geo pay or jaya pay however they
00:49 - say once again thank you so much my guru
00:52 - honestly when I read this message I was
00:54 - almost in tears seeing your success is
00:56 - the most rewarding part of my job that's
00:58 - what wakes me up every day and keeps me
01:00 - going despite the difficulty of course
01:02 - production I love what I do and I
01:04 - believe anyone can be successful if they
01:06 - do what they really love to do that's
01:08 - literally the only ingredient for
01:10 - success some people say it's the
01:11 - determination and consistency that
01:13 - brings you success but I disagree in my
01:16 - opinion if you do what you really love
01:18 - determination and consistency will come
01:20 - naturally I worked really hard in my
01:23 - last job and never got any recognition
01:24 - from the CEO every month they awarded
01:27 - someone as the Employee of the Month but
01:29 - most of the time these people these
01:30 - nominees were people in the sales or
01:32 - customer support team essentially anyone
01:35 - who brought more money to the table not
01:37 - us developers working really hard at the
01:39 - back of the office the CEO didn't even
01:41 - know my name
01:42 - at the same time I was getting a lot of
01:44 - thank you emails from my students for
01:46 - teaching online part-time that's the
01:48 - reason why I decided to quit my job and
01:50 - teach full-time I know I would be making
01:52 - less money than my full-time salary as a
01:54 - senior software engineer but I didn't
01:57 - care I knew that by teaching online I
01:59 - could help a lot of people in the world
02:00 - become successful and I knew I would
02:02 - hear from them so to the person who
02:04 - wrote this in this survey I don't know
02:06 - your name I don't know who you are and
02:08 - where you live I'm guessing India but I
02:10 - can tell you that I'm so proud of you
02:12 - I'm proud of your determined
02:13 - and not giving up and getting to the top
02:15 - level
