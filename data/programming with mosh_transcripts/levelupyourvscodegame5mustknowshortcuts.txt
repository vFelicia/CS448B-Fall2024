00:23 - docomo on our list is multic cursor
00:26 - editing let's say we have a bunch of
00:27 - objects and here we want to change name
00:30 - name to username there are a few ways we
00:32 - can do this we can select the name
00:33 - property now to select the next
00:36 - occurrence of name we press command and
00:38 - D on Mac or control and D on Windows now
00:42 - we have two cursors so we repeat and
00:44 - select all occurrences of name with this
00:47 - we can change name to username in wo now
00:50 - to stop multic cursor editing we press
00:52 - the skape button twice that was one way
00:55 - but there's a faster way we can select
00:57 - name now to select all occurrences of
00:59 - name we press
01:00 - shift command and L on Mac or shift
01:03 - control and L on Windows now all

01:30 - let's say we're looking for a file
01:31 - called product list one way to find it
01:34 - is to go to our project and dig into
01:36 - various folders to find that file this
01:39 - is time consuming there's a faster way
01:42 - we can press command and P on Mac or
01:44 - control and P on Windows this brings up
01:47 - the search box now here we can type
01:49 - product list and this shows all files
01:52 - matching this pattern but there's a
01:54 - faster way we don't even have to type
01:56 - the full file name we can type
01:58 - abbreviations for example we can type
02:00 - prod list and again we get all files
02:03 - matching this pattern now if you're
02:05 - looking for a file called Product list.
02:07 - test. TSX again we don't have to type

02:21 - project a symbol can be a function a
02:23 - class a variable a constant anything
02:26 - that has an identifier for example let's
02:28 - imagine we looking for a function called
02:30 - simulate delay and we are not sure where
02:33 - that function is defined so here we can
02:35 - press command and T on Mac or control
02:38 - and on Windows and search for simulate
02:41 - delay there you go this function is
02:44 - defined in this module so we press enter
02:47 - and here's our function the next
02:50 - shortcut on our list is the command
02:52 - pallet and this is the Gateway for
02:54 - almost any vs code commands it's
02:57 - particularly useful when we forget
02:58 - something to bring bring it up we press
03:01 - shift command and P on Mac or shift
03:04 - control and P on Windows now here we can
