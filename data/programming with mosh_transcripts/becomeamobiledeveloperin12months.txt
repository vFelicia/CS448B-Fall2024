00:00 - to become a mobile app developer there
00:01 - are five essential skills let's go over
00:04 - them one by one there are basically two
00:06 - ways to build mobile apps native or
00:08 - crossplatform with Native development we
00:10 - can build an app that runs only on a
00:12 - particular platform like iOS or Android
00:15 - this approach gives us full control over
00:17 - the capabilities of the target platform
00:19 - resulting in great performance and the
00:21 - best user experience however the
00:24 - downside is that if you want to build
00:25 - the same app for a different platform
00:27 - you have to create a separate project in
00:29 - an entirely different language and
00:31 - ecosystem this means two separate
00:33 - projects and two sets of bugs to fix
00:35 - that's where crossplatform or
00:37 - multiplatform development comes to the
00:39 - rescue with crossplatform development we
00:42 - can reduce development Time by reusing
00:44 - the same code for different platforms
00:46 - and potentially reduce bugs fixing a bug
00:48 - once means it's fixed across multiple
00:51 - platforms check out my full video link
