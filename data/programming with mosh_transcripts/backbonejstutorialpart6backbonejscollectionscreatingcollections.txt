00:05 - Backbone collections are ordered set of
00:07 - models they're useful when you want to
00:10 - work with a group of models building
00:13 - collections is very easy and it's
00:14 - similar to building models we simply
00:17 - extend back bonded collection and
00:18 - specify the type of models that the
00:21 - collection can hold let's see this in
00:23 - action
00:31 - you
00:41 - we can put objects in a collection in
00:43 - two ways we can pass the initial array
00:46 - of models when creating the collection
00:47 - or we can call the add method on an
00:50 - instantiated collection
00:58 - you
01:29 - the add method is provided by underscore
01:31 - and is available in all background
01:33 - collections underscore provides many
01:36 - other methods that make working with
01:38 - collections really easy we'll cover them
01:40 - in a few minutes alright now let's go to
01:43 - chrome and inspect our collection
01:52 - no this property's here
01:55 - these are the ones that are collection
01:57 - inherited from the base backbone that
01:59 - collection object every backbone
02:02 - collection has lengths and models
02:04 - property the length property returns the
02:07 - number of models inside the collection
02:09 - and the models property gives us direct
02:12 - access to these models most often we use
02:15 - the add or get methods to access a model
02:18 - in the collection let's try them
02:21 - the add method returns a model at the
02:24 - given index here zero represents the
02:27 - first model in the collection also note
02:30 - that this model has the CID of c1 every
02:34 - backbone model has two IDs one is a
02:36 - persistent ID which is assigned by the
02:39 - server and another one is the client ID
02:41 - or CID which is assigned by backbone CID
02:45 - is a temporary identifier that backbone
02:47 - uses to keep track of objects
02:50 - we can get a model from a collection by
02:53 - its ID which is its persistent ID or CID
02:56 - which is the client ID so another way
03:00 - for us to get the same model here is
03:02 - like this
03:07 - we can also remove a model from a
03:10 - collection by calling the remove method
03:15 - the remove method expects a model so you
03:18 - need to get the model by either its
03:20 - index or its ID and then pass it to this
03:22 - method
03:25 - let's verify that the model is removed
03:34 - bang-bang collections provide an easy
03:36 - way to work with a group of models we
03:39 - can create a collection type by
03:40 - extending back bonded collection we can
03:43 - add models to a collection but
03:45 - instantiate a collection or by calling
03:47 - the add method the length property
03:49 - returns the number of models inside the
03:52 - collection the add method returns the
03:55 - model at the specified index the get
03:58 - method returns the model specified by
04:00 - its ID or see ID we can remove a model
04:04 - from a collection by calling the remove
04:05 - method all the methods we've covered in
04:09 - this lecture are provided by underscore
04:11 - in the next lecture we'll cover more of
04:14 - underscore methods available in
04:15 - collections thank you for watching
