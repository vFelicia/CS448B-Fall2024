00:00 - JavaScript is the most popular
00:02 - programming language in the world and
00:03 - arguably the most hated due to its weird
00:06 - parts and chaotic ecosystem in
00:08 - JavaScript we can declare variables
00:10 - using the let keyword JavaScript is a
00:12 - dynamically typed language meaning the
00:14 - type of variables is determined at
00:16 - runtime in JavaScript we have two
00:18 - categories of data primitive types and
00:20 - reference types primitive types include
00:23 - strings numbers booleans null and
00:25 - undefined reference types are objects
00:28 - arrays and functions JavaScript has a
00:31 - lot of weird parts for example if you
00:33 - add two empty arrays we get an empty
00:35 - string if you add an empty array to an
00:37 - empty object we get the string object
00:40 - object but if you swap the order of
00:42 - operant we get zero and if you add two
00:45 - empty objects we get not a number what
00:47 - the hell in JavaScript we have
00:49 - arithmetic operators for computations
00:52 - comparison operators for comparing
00:54 - values two equality operators loose and
00:57 - straight you also have logical operators
00:59 - for logical operations and bitwise
01:02 - operators that nobody uses in JavaScript
01:04 - we have two ways to control the flow of
01:06 - our code if and else as well as switch
01:08 - and case similar to Java or C++ we have
01:12 - three types of Loops for repeating an
01:14 - action multiple times four Loops y loops
01:17 - and do wide Loops JavaScript doesn't
01:19 - have a standard library in a traditional
01:22 - sense like python or Java it has a few
01:24 - Global objects and functions that are
01:26 - always available like math date and Par
01:28 - in and a bunch of other other stuff that
01:30 - largely depends on where your code is
01:32 - running JavaScript code can run in a
01:35 - browser or on the server with no JS Doo
01:38 - or bun JavaScript has a gigantic
01:40 - ecosystem of packages libraries
01:43 - Frameworks and even meta Frameworks that
01:45 - come out every day by the time you learn
01:47 - a new framework it's already outdated
01:49 - and replaced by something newer and
01:51 - shinier for almost every problem there
01:53 - might be hundreds of packages claiming
01:55 - to be the perfect solution we can
01:57 - install these packages using package
01:59 - managers like like npm yarn pnpm and Bun
02:03 - JavaScript is constantly evolving and
02:05 - the latest features may not be supported
02:07 - by older browsers so we use transpilers
02:09 - to translate or convert modern
02:11 - JavaScript code into a format that can
02:13 - run in older environments the most
02:15 - common transpilers are Babel typescript
02:18 - and Tracer we use build tools also
02:20 - called bundlers to turn development code
02:22 - into production code build tools combine
02:25 - and compress our JavaScript code into
02:27 - one or more bundles that can be used in
02:29 - a browser the most common build tools
02:31 - are webpack parcel rollup and Es build
02:34 - and that was JavaScript in 2 minutes
