00:03 - in the last lecture you learn how to
00:05 - enumerate the properties of an object
00:07 - now using this technique we can get all
00:10 - the properties in an object and copy
00:12 - them into another object so let's say we
00:15 - want to create another circle object
00:17 - which is a copy of the circle object
00:20 - here I'm gonna call that another so
00:23 - constant another initially we set it to
00:27 - an empty object now we can use the for
00:30 - in loop to iterate over all the
00:32 - properties in this object and copy them
00:35 - into this new object so for let key in
00:39 - circle now we use the bracket notation
00:42 - to access a property with the given key
00:46 - so we said another of key to circle of
00:50 - key so basically here in the first
00:53 - iteration key will be radius so this
00:57 - code will be equivalent to this another
01:00 - of radius so we're setting the radius
01:03 - property of another object to circle of
01:08 - radius now here on the right side of the
01:11 - assignment operator we are reading the
01:14 - radius property of the circle the value
01:16 - of this property is one so we'll get one
01:18 - and put it in the radius property of the
01:22 - another object okay
01:24 - now let's log another on the console
01:27 - save the changes so here we have this
01:31 - radius property is set to one and here's
01:34 - our draw method so if we call another
01:36 - draw everything works as we expect
01:39 - beautiful but this approach for copying
01:43 - or cloning an object is a little bit old
01:45 - in modern JavaScript we have better ways
01:48 - to achieve the same thing one way is to
01:50 - use the object assign method let me show
01:53 - you so I'm gonna comment out these few
01:56 - lines we have this object that you have
02:00 - seen before this object has a method
02:02 - called assign now here as the first
02:05 - argument we can pass a target object
02:07 - which can be an empty object or an
02:10 - existing object you will see the
02:12 - difference in a second and then we can
02:14 - pass one or more so
02:16 - objects let's say circle what this
02:21 - method does is that it takes all the
02:23 - properties and methods in the source
02:26 - object and then copies them into this
02:29 - new object and finally returns the
02:31 - result here so this line of code is
02:35 - exactly equivalent to these three lines
02:37 - if we save the changes we get the exact
02:41 - same result
02:42 - now this target object that we pass here
02:44 - it doesn't have to be an empty object it
02:46 - can be an existing object it can have
02:48 - one or more properties or methods so as
02:51 - an example let's add a color property
02:54 - here we set that to yellow now save the
02:58 - changes so this new object has the color
03:02 - property that we initially had here as
03:05 - well as the members of the circle object
03:08 - so this is the object the design method
03:10 - now let me revert this back to an empty
03:13 - object I'm going to show you yet another
03:16 - simpler and more elegant way to clone an
03:20 - object we can use this spread operator
03:23 - so another here we set this to a new
03:28 - object and then use this spread operator
03:30 - which is three dots to spread this
03:34 - circle object basically what this
03:36 - operator does is that it takes all the
03:38 - properties and methods and this object
03:41 - and puts them here in between these
03:44 - curly braces
03:45 - so this is the simplest way to clone an
03:48 - object save the changes again we get the
03:51 - exact same circle object as before so
03:54 - here's what I want you to take away
03:55 - object of the sign copies the properties
03:58 - and methods from one or more sources
04:01 - into a target object and we can use that
04:04 - to clone an object or combine multiple
04:07 - objects into a single object and the
04:10 - spread operator is used to spread an
04:12 - object which basically means getting all
04:15 - these properties and methods and putting
04:17 - them into another object
04:23 - hi guys thank you for watching my
04:25 - javascript tutorial this tutorial is

04:34 - application developer must know if
04:36 - you're an absolute beginner or have some
04:38 - experience in JavaScript and are looking
04:40 - for a fun and in-depth course that
