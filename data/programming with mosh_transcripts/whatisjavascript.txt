00:00 - [Music]
00:01 - in the 3-minute introduction I'm going
00:04 - to answer for frequently asked questions
00:06 - about JavaScript
00:08 - what is JavaScript what can you do with
00:10 - it where does JavaScript code run and
00:13 - what is the difference between
00:14 - JavaScript and echo script so let's
00:17 - start with the first question what is
00:19 - JavaScript JavaScript is one of the most
00:22 - popular and widely used programming
00:24 - languages in the world right now it's
00:27 - growing faster than any other
00:28 - programming languages and big companies
00:30 - like Netflix Walmart and PayPal build
00:34 - internal applications around javascript
00:36 - and here's the average salary of a
00:38 - JavaScript developer in the United
00:40 - States and it's only $2,000 a year so
00:44 - it's a great opportunity to get a good
00:46 - job out of learning JavaScript you can
00:48 - work as a front-end developer or a
00:51 - back-end developer for a full stack
00:53 - developer who knows both the front end
00:55 - and the back end now the second question
00:57 - what can you do with JavaScript for a
01:00 - long time
01:01 - javascript was only used in browsers to
01:03 - build interactive web pages some
01:06 - developers refer to javascript as a toy
01:08 - language but those days are gone because
01:11 - of huge community support and
01:13 - investments by large companies like
01:15 - Facebook and Google these days you can
01:17 - build full-blown web or mobile apps as
01:20 - well as real time networking
01:22 - applications like chats and video
01:24 - streaming services command-line tools or
01:27 - even games here's an example a third
01:31 - question where does JavaScript code run
01:34 - javascript was originally designed to
01:36 - run only in browsers so every browser
01:39 - has what we call a JavaScript engine
01:41 - that can execute JavaScript code for
01:44 - example the JavaScript engines in
01:46 - firefox and chrome are SpiderMonkey and
01:49 - v8 in 2009 a very clever engineer called
01:53 - Ryan Dahl took the open-source
01:56 - JavaScript engine in chrome and embedded
01:59 - it inside a C++ program he called that
02:02 - program node the node is a C++ program
02:05 - that includes Google's v8 JavaScript
02:09 - engine now with this we can run
02:12 - JavaScript code out
02:13 - of a browser so we can pass our
02:15 - JavaScript code to node for execution
02:18 - and this means with JavaScript we can
02:20 - build the backend for our web and mobile
02:23 - applications so in a nutshell JavaScript
02:26 - code can be run inside of a browser or
02:28 - in node browsers and node provide a
02:31 - runtime environment for our JavaScript
02:34 - code and finally the last question what
02:37 - is the difference between JavaScript and
02:39 - Eggman script well ECMO script is just a
02:42 - specification javascript is a
02:44 - programming language that confirms to
02:46 - this specification so we have this
02:49 - organization called a comma which is
02:51 - responsible for defining standards they
02:54 - take care of this Eggman script
02:55 - specification the first version of
02:58 - Eggman script was released in 1997 then
03:01 - starting from 2015
03:03 - ACMA has been working on annual releases
03:06 - of a newest specification so in 2015
03:09 - they released a kimono script 2015 which
03:12 - is also called ECMO script version 6 or
03:15 - es6 for short this specification defined
03:18 - many new features for JavaScript alright
03:21 - enough theory
03:22 - let's see javascript in action so every
03:25 - browser has a JavaScript engine and we
03:27 - can easily write JavaScript code here
03:29 - without any additional tools of course
03:31 - this is not how we build real-world
03:33 - applications but this is just for a
03:35 - quick demo so open up Chrome right click
03:38 - on an empty area and go to inspect now
03:42 - this opens up chrome developer tools
03:44 - here select the console tab this is our
03:47 - JavaScript console and we can write any
03:49 - valid JavaScript code here so type this
03:52 - console dot log put a single code here
03:58 - and then hello world another single code
04:01 - to terminate close the parentheses and
04:05 - add a semicolon at the end now as you go
04:08 - through the course you're going to
04:09 - understand exactly what all this means
04:11 - for now don't worry about it so now I'll
04:13 - press ENTER and you can see the hello
04:15 - world message on the console we can also
04:18 - write mathematical expressions here for
04:20 - example two plus two we get four or we
04:24 - can do something like this alert
04:26 - practices single coat yo enter and
04:30 - here's an alert in the next lecture I'm
04:33 - going to talk about setting up your
04:35 - development environment for writing
04:37 - JavaScript code
04:40 - well hello it's mahshar thank you for
04:43 - watching my javascript tutorial I just
04:45 - wanted to quickly let you know that this
04:47 - tutorial is part of my complete
04:49 - JavaScript course where you can learn
04:51 - about all the essential concepts in
04:53 - JavaScript the course is packed with
04:55 - lots of exercises and solutions and by
04:57 - the end of watching the course you will
04:59 - also receive a certificate of completion
05:01 - in case you're interested you can find a
05:03 - link in the video description and if not
05:05 - that's perfectly fine continue watching
05:07 - as the next section is coming up
