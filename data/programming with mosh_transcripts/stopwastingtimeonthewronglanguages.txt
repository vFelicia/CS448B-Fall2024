00:00 - I see a lot of my students try to learn
00:02 - many unrelated programming languages at
00:04 - the same time they learn a bit of C++
00:06 - while learning JavaScript and python
00:09 - look each of these languages has certain
00:11 - strengths and is often used for a
00:13 - specific kind of job in the tech world
00:15 - for example C++ is a powerful beast when
00:18 - it comes to building amazing games or
00:20 - controlling physical objects like
00:22 - SmartWatches self-driving cars and all
00:25 - the cool gadgets on the other hand
00:27 - JavaScript is all about making websites
00:29 - interact Ive and dynamic so someone
00:31 - learning JavaScript and C++ at the same
00:34 - time is like someone trying to become a
00:36 - dentist and a heart surgeon at the same
00:38 - time let's be realistic if you only know
00:40 - bits of JavaScript and C++ you can't
00:43 - build either a game or a website if you
00:46 - want that coding job you have to focus
00:48 - on one language at a time and then learn
00:50 - the other tools and technologies that go
00:52 - with it so you can build something that
00:54 - employers will actually care about
