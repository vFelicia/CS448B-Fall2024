00:01 - could a robot replace your job figure
00:03 - oan is a glimpse of a future where AI
00:06 - isn't just software anymore in this
00:08 - video we'll see this incredible robot in
00:10 - action explore how it could change the
00:12 - way we work and tackle some big
00:14 - questions about the Future Let's dive
00:16 - into
00:17 - [Music]
00:19 - this so what exactly is figure1 it's a
00:22 - humanid robot about 5' 6 in tall and
00:25 - weighing around 60 kg what sets it apart
00:28 - is its brain power by open ai's Cutting
00:31 - Edge technology this means it can hold
00:33 - full conversations understand your
00:35 - instructions and react instantly imagine
00:38 - it working in a warehouse assisting at
00:40 - home or performing all sorts of jobs we
00:43 - currently do ourselves this is
00:44 - groundbreaking territory for robotics
00:47 - let's see what it can do in their
00:48 - official demo hey figure one what do you
00:50 - see right
00:54 - now I see a red apple on a plate in the
00:58 - center of the table a drying rack with
01:00 - cups and a plate and you standing nearby
01:03 - with your hand on the table great can I
01:05 - have something to
01:09 - eat sure
01:15 - thing okay we have seen figure o1 in
01:17 - action that's definitely impressive but
01:19 - let's be real it's not the only player
01:21 - in this game companies like Tesla Amazon
01:24 - and others are all pushing robotics
01:26 - forward in their own way so what makes
01:28 - figure1 special well it seems really
01:31 - good at understanding normal language
01:33 - the way we talk every day that means it
01:35 - could be used for all sorts of things
01:37 - not just repeating the same task over
01:39 - and over like some other robots Okay but
01:42 - how does figure1 even understand what
01:44 - we're saying this is where things get
01:46 - really interesting it's all thanks to
01:48 - open AI the same company behind chat GPT
01:51 - they specialize in creating incredibly
01:54 - powerful AI systems focusing a lot on
01:56 - language understanding this means
01:58 - figure1 can sort through your
02:00 - instructions and respond like a human
02:02 - would but the real breakthrough is that
02:04 - open AI doesn't just give figure one
02:07 - those chatbot smarts they take it
02:09 - further by connecting the language
02:11 - understanding to the robot's body and
02:13 - his cameras so not only does figure1 get
02:16 - what you're saying it can actually carry
02:18 - out the task that's why it's so special
02:21 - and what's even cooler figure1 keeps
02:23 - learning every conversation everything
02:25 - it sees it uses that to get better at
02:28 - understanding our world think of it like
02:30 - a super smart roommate who gets a little
02:32 - bit smarter every day oh and by the way
02:35 - if this whole robot and AI field excites
02:37 - you if you're ever thinking about a
02:39 - career building these machines then you
02:41 - will definitely want to learn
02:42 - programming languages like Python and
02:44 - C++ these are like the building blocks
02:47 - that let us create the super smart
02:49 - brains behind robots like figure1 python
02:51 - helps the robot understand our language
02:53 - and C++ helps it control its movements
02:57 - okay figure1 is seriously cool no
02:59 - question that there but let's be honest
03:01 - a robot this smart makes people both
03:03 - excited and a little nervous right and
03:06 - that's where things get really
03:07 - interesting and maybe even a bit scary
03:10 - on the one hand think about all the good
03:12 - stuff robots like figure one could take
03:14 - care of boring or dangerous jobs keeping
03:17 - people safe but on the other hand it
03:19 - raises big questions about jobs if a
03:21 - robot can understand what we say and do
03:24 - the work too what happens to the people
03:26 - who do those jobs now figure's website
03:29 - talks about how there aren't enough
03:31 - workers in warehouses that's probably
03:33 - who they want to sell their robots to
03:35 - first but hold on let's think bigger any
03:37 - job where you do the same thing over and
03:39 - over and need to understand instructions
03:42 - those jobs could be in trouble talking
03:44 - to customers sorting stuff even putting
03:46 - things together this robot could change
03:48 - all of that speaking of jobs what about
03:51 - AI replacing software Engineers I mean
03:53 - if robots can write code does that mean
03:55 - software Engineers are next there is a
03:57 - lot of hype and fear around this and and
04:00 - I've actually made a few videos about
04:02 - this topic I highly recommend you to
04:04 - watch those videos to better understand
04:06 - the situation but the short answer is no
04:09 - AI is a powerful tool but it can't
04:11 - replace the creativity and problem
04:13 - solving skills of a human software
04:15 - engineer figure makes some bold claims
04:17 - about the problems they're trying to
04:19 - solve on their website they're saying
04:21 - there are 10 million unfilled jobs in
04:23 - the US 7 million of those are for
04:26 - essential roles in warehouses
04:28 - transportation and Retail there are only
04:30 - 6 million people available to fill those
04:32 - positions and key Warehouse suppliers
04:35 - predict that they will run out of people
04:37 - to hirer by 2024 and that leads to their
04:40 - big claim their goal is to deploy
04:42 - autonomous humanid workers to support us
04:45 - on a global scale so this isn't about a
04:48 - few robots in one warehouse but a large
04:50 - scale change but let's take a step back
04:53 - for a second I'm not an expert on job
04:55 - num so I can say how accurate all of
04:57 - this is but remember company sometimes
05:00 - make problems seem bigger than they are
05:02 - to make their Solutions look even more
05:04 - amazing but hey let's play along for a
05:06 - minute let's say those numbers are real
05:08 - and figure is genuinely trying to solve
05:10 - job shortages with their robots is that
05:13 - the whole story what if people don't
05:15 - want robot service think about it good
05:17 - robots really replace chefs servers or
05:20 - Baristas sure they might make the coffee
05:22 - but would you ditch your favorite local
05:24 - spot for a place run by robots that
05:27 - human connection the Barista who knows
05:29 - order the sushi chef with years of
05:32 - tradition behind their skill that's hard
05:34 - to replicate I actually asked all of you
05:36 - on YouTube if you would ditch your
05:38 - favorite Sushi Spot the one with the
05:40 - experienced Chef who knows exactly how
05:42 - you like your roles for a place where
05:44 - robots make everything and guess what
05:46 - 85% of you said no they would want the
05:49 - human chef with the skills and the
05:51 - passion imagine a restaurant that fired
05:53 - all its staff and replace them with
05:55 - robots it might seem like the future but
05:57 - it would feel cold and impersonal more
06:00 - like a factory than a restaurant would
06:01 - you really want to eat there right next
06:03 - door imagine a small cozy Italian
06:06 - restaurant run by a friendly family
06:08 - people crave that human connection the
06:10 - feeling of being welcome like a friend
06:12 - let's not forget that some of this isn't
06:14 - entirely new for example back in 2019
06:17 - this hotel in Japan opened that was
06:20 - totally run by robots I mean robot
06:22 - dinosaurs greating you little robot guys
06:25 - taking your bags sounds wild right but
06:27 - it turned out to be more like a one time
06:29 - experience like a museum not the kind of
06:32 - place you want to keep coming back to
06:34 - McDonald's also tried something similar
06:36 - with an automated restaurant in Texas in
06:38 - 2022 customers ordered on touch screens
06:41 - and their food arrived on conveyor belts
06:44 - it seemed really high-tech but in the
06:46 - end a lot of people still prefer to talk
06:48 - to a real person when they're ordering
06:50 - food so let's be real are these robot
06:53 - fears just overblown there's definitely
06:55 - a lot of hype these companies need
06:57 - funding and painting a picture of a
06:59 - world desperate for robot Solutions
07:02 - helps those Investments flow there's no
07:04 - denying that investment drives
07:06 - Innovation but let's take a breath
07:08 - what's the real story here here's what I
07:10 - think I think robots are amazing tools
07:13 - they can do dangerous jobs explore space
07:15 - all the amazing stuff but they are not a
07:17 - magic solution for everything they can
07:19 - fully replace the human touch the
07:21 - creativity and the connection that makes
07:24 - so much of our world meaningful so
07:26 - here's the big question what do you
07:27 - think about all this would you eat at a
07:30 - robot run restaurant is there a place
07:32 - for humanoids like figure 01 in the
07:34 - future or is the human touch
07:35 - Irreplaceable let's keep this
07:37 - conversation going share your opinions
