00:00 - what if I told you it's possible to land
00:02 - a coding job in a year even without a
00:04 - computer science degree meet my student
00:06 - John he used to work as an aviation
00:08 - electrician earning $28,000 a year he
00:11 - dedicated 6 months to learn to code and
00:13 - landed his first developer job as a
00:16 - frontend developer boosting his salary
00:18 - to
00:19 - $552,000 now he's a full stack developer
00:21 - earning $90,000 a year John story is
00:24 - outstanding and quite frankly not
00:26 - everyone can get a job so quickly but
00:29 - I've seen tons of people people
00:30 - transform their careers through coding
00:32 - in a year this is Francisco he was an
00:34 - electronics engineer he learned to code
00:36 - and landed his first developer job
00:38 - within a year now he's a software
00:40 - architect earning 2 and a half times
00:42 - more than his previous job so are you
00:44 - curious how they did it and if you can
00:46 - achieve the same results in this video
00:48 - I'm sharing a stepbystep system plus
00:51 - actionable tips to help you break into
00:53 - the world of coding even if you are
00:55 - starting from
00:58 - scratch all right the biggest mistake I
01:00 - see beginners make is that they try to
01:02 - learn a bunch of languages like Python
01:05 - and JavaScript because somebody on
01:06 - YouTube told them they are popular so
01:09 - they assume that simply learning a few
01:11 - popular languages automatically makes
01:13 - them hirable but it doesn't work that
01:15 - way these languages have specific
01:17 - purposes and are often used in different
01:20 - kinds of jobs some of these languages
01:22 - are also unrelated so learning all of
01:24 - them together doesn't really prepare you
01:26 - for any kind of job so instead of
01:28 - focusing on Pro programming languages
01:31 - the first step is figuring out your
01:32 - dream take job do you want to build
01:34 - beautiful websites mobile apps games
01:37 - this decision will tell you what exactly
01:40 - you need to learn so you wouldn't waste
01:42 - time learning things that you're not
01:43 - going to use the next step is finding a
01:46 - learning path for the kind of work you
01:47 - want to do for example for web
01:49 - development you need to learn HTML CSS
01:52 - JavaScript and a bunch of other stuff
01:54 - now this applies to everything if game
01:56 - development gets you pumped that's a
01:58 - whole different set of tools so just do
02:00 - a simple search like game development
02:02 - learning path or data science learning
02:04 - path there are tons of road maps online
02:07 - the next step is learning and this is
02:09 - where I've seen a lot of people make
02:11 - common mistakes that slow them down the
02:13 - first mistake is that they go on YouTube
02:15 - and watch random disconnected tutorials
02:18 - trying to learn bits and pieces it takes
02:20 - far longer to learn something properly
02:22 - this way the other common mistake I see
02:24 - is people go on platforms like udemy and
02:26 - take these super long courses thinking
02:29 - that more hours means they will learn
02:31 - more but in reality they often never
02:33 - finish up those courses and all those
02:35 - unfinished courses pile up and make them
02:37 - feel less motivated here's the right way
02:39 - to learn find a properly structured
02:41 - course you think you can commit to and
02:43 - finish there's so many excellent options
02:46 - out there pick an instructor whose
02:47 - teaching style you like and then
02:49 - dedicate yourself to actually finishing
02:51 - each course now simply watching videos
02:53 - is not enough coding is about solving
02:56 - new problems so you have to constantly
02:58 - practice and that's what I love love
03:00 - about coding that's what inspired me to
03:01 - become a software engineer and not a
03:03 - medical doctor or lawyer because I
03:05 - wasn't great at memorizing but with
03:07 - coding you don't need to memorize much
03:09 - you need analytical and problem solving
03:11 - skills and with practice you will
03:14 - naturally memorize the stuff you need to
03:16 - know now the best way to practice is
03:18 - asking chat GPT for exercise or project
03:21 - ideas just tell it what you're learning
03:23 - and your skill level and it can suggest
03:25 - some options if the suggestions are too
03:27 - complex just ask for simpler ones it's a
03:30 - great way to find exercises and projects
03:33 - that will actually challenge you and
03:34 - help your progress now as you build
03:37 - projects make sure to put them on GitHub
03:39 - GitHub is like an online resume for
03:41 - developers you can put your code there
03:43 - and show it to potential employers plus
03:46 - you can get feedback from others in the
03:48 - community and improve your code there
03:50 - are also millions of projects on GitHub
03:52 - so you can look at other people's code
03:53 - and learn from them now let's talk about
03:56 - interviews a common mistake I see people
03:58 - make is not prepar ing for those coding
04:01 - interviews you can be a fantastic coder
04:03 - but interviews are their own Beast
04:05 - especially at those top tech companies
04:07 - like Google Facebook and so on they
04:09 - often ask you tricky questions about
04:11 - data structures and algorithms like how
04:14 - to reverse a link list this is one of
04:16 - the topics taught to computer science
04:18 - students so if you don't have a computer
04:20 - science degree make sure to study this
04:22 - topic in reality you might never use
04:24 - these algorithms in your day-to-day work
04:26 - but studying them helps you build your
04:28 - problem solving skill skills and stand
04:30 - out in interviews so along with all the
04:33 - things you have in your learning path
04:35 - make sure to take a course on data
04:36 - structures and algorithms to prepare for
04:39 - interviews a very useful website you can
04:41 - use to practice these interview
04:43 - questions is lead code you can filter
04:45 - questions by complexity or companies and
04:48 - so on it's a very useful website also
04:51 - there are websites that offer mock
04:52 - interviews with experienced developers
04:55 - so you can do a mock interview and get
04:56 - feedback about your weak spots and where
04:59 - you got to improve Pro all right once
05:00 - you're confident in your skills start
05:02 - applying for jobs but keep in mind you
05:05 - may apply for 100 jobs only here back
05:07 - from 10 to 20 and get five interviews
05:10 - it's totally normal don't take it
05:12 - personally and definitely don't let it
05:14 - discourage you remember you're not the
05:16 - only one applying the key here is
05:18 - persistence keep applying for new jobs
05:20 - and also connect with Recruiters on
05:23 - platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter
05:24 - until you land your first job quite
05:27 - frankly Landing the first job can be the
05:29 - hardest part but once you get your first
05:31 - job and have some real life experience
05:33 - under your belt finding those next
05:35 - opportunities becomes a whole lot easier
05:38 - now if you have any questions let me
