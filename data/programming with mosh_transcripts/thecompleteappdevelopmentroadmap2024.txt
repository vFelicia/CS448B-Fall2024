00:00 - to become a mobile app developer there
00:01 - are five essential skills let's go over
00:04 - them one by
00:07 - one there are basically two ways to
00:09 - build mobile apps native or
00:11 - crossplatform with Native development we
00:13 - can build an app that runs only on a
00:15 - particular platform like iOS or Android
00:18 - this approach gives us full control over
00:20 - the capabilities of the target platform
00:22 - resulting in great performance and the
00:24 - best user experience however the
00:26 - downside is that if you want to build
00:28 - the same app for a different platform
00:30 - form we have to create a separate
00:31 - project in an entirely different
00:33 - language and ecosystem this means two
00:35 - separate projects and two sets of bugs
00:38 - to fix that's where crossplatform or
00:40 - multiplatform development comes to the
00:42 - rescue with crossplatform development we
00:44 - can reduce development Time by reusing
00:47 - the same code for different platforms
00:49 - and potentially reduce bugs fixing a bug
00:51 - once means it's fixed across multiple
00:54 - platforms now for Native development we
00:56 - have a few options for iOS we can use
00:59 - Objective C which is an older language
01:01 - or Swift which is modern and preferred
01:03 - for Android we can use Java which is a
01:06 - traditional language or cotland which is
01:08 - modern and preferred for crossplatform
01:10 - development the option depends on the
01:12 - framework or toolkit we use there are
01:14 - several crossplatform toolkits like
01:16 - react native flutter cotland
01:18 - multiplatform Maui and a few others
01:20 - let's dive into each one first off we
01:22 - have react native which was released by
01:24 - Facebook in 2015 this toolkit lets you
01:27 - build mobile apps using JavaScript and
01:29 - and react which is a popular library for
01:32 - building web user interfaces some big
01:34 - names using react native include
01:36 - Microsoft Office scype and even Facebook
01:39 - itself then we have flut which is a
01:41 - Google product that came out in 2017
01:44 - flut uses a programming language called
01:46 - Dart which takes the best parts of
01:48 - JavaScript Java and C some examples of
01:51 - apps built with flutter are eBay Alibaba
01:54 - and Google pay it's really powerful and
01:56 - gaining a lot of traction now let's talk
01:58 - about cotland multiplatform this is the
02:00 - newest player released by jetbrains the
02:02 - same company behind tools like intellig
02:05 - pycharm and webstorm in my opinion the
02:07 - best idees in the world it uses the
02:10 - cotlin programming language which is a
02:12 - modern language inspired by Java apps
02:14 - like McDonald's Netflix and cash app are
02:17 - built with cotton multiplatform finally
02:19 - we have Maui which stands for net
02:22 - multiplatform appui introduced by
02:24 - Microsoft Maui allows you to build
02:27 - native mobile and desktop apps using C
02:29 - and . net these days most companies
02:32 - prefer to use multiplatform development
02:34 - to reduce their costs this means we can
02:37 - rule out native development for now and
02:39 - focus on cross-platform options now
02:41 - which framework is the best well there
02:43 - is no such a thing as the best framework
02:45 - yes there are people out there like our
02:47 - Superstar highly opinionated developer
02:49 - Mr John Smith who swears by react native
02:52 - but there are others with a different
02:53 - opinion the reality is that neither of
02:56 - these Frameworks is perfect each has its
02:58 - own problems and quirks that you you
02:59 - will discover once you start building
03:01 - real applications Beyond YouTube
03:03 - tutorials and the reason for that is
03:05 - that they try to support two entirely
03:07 - different platforms at the same time so
03:10 - which crossplatform solution should you
03:12 - choose well it depends on two things
03:14 - first on what languages and Technologies
03:16 - you're familiar with for example if
03:18 - you're a c developer Maui might be the
03:20 - easier route if you know web
03:22 - Technologies like JavaScript and react
03:24 - you might want to go for react native
03:26 - it's an easier transition from web to
03:28 - mobile development the other factor is
03:30 - job opportunities there are often more
03:32 - jobs available for react native and
03:34 - flutter here you can see the number of
03:36 - open positions for different types of
03:38 - mobile app developers in the US now this
03:40 - is the current situation here and maybe
03:42 - different where you live maybe there are
03:44 - more job opportunities for a flutter
03:46 - developer so I recommend doing your own
03:49 - research rather than taking my or
03:51 - someone else's advice about which route
03:52 - to choose but realistically if you're
03:55 - looking for a career in Mobile
03:56 - development you would have to choose
03:58 - between react native and flutter if you
04:00 - have basic web development skills react
04:02 - native is a better route otherwise I
04:04 - would recommend flutter because Dart
04:07 - which is the programming language that
04:08 - flutter uses is a nicer language to work
04:11 - with than JavaScript it's more modern
04:13 - and doesn't have the quirks and weird
04:15 - Parts you find in JavaScript so decide
04:17 - between JavaScript or Dart and commit to
04:19 - a study plan I believe if you dedicate 3
04:22 - to 5 hours every day you can learn the
04:25 - essence of either of these languages in
04:27 - about 2 months to help you on this
04:29 - journey I've created a free
04:30 - supplementary PDF that breaks down the
04:33 - specific Concepts you need to learn for
04:35 - each skill it also includes several
04:37 - project ideas to help you practice and
04:39 - apply what you have learned it's a great
04:41 - resource to review your progress find
04:43 - gaps in your knowledge and prepare for
04:45 - interviews you can find the link in the
04:47 - description Box by the way I have a
04:49 - bunch of tutorials on this channel and
04:51 - complete courses on my website if you're
04:53 - looking for structur learning again
04:55 - links are in the description box the
04:57 - next thing you need to learn is a
04:58 - Version Control System them like git git
05:00 - is not a programming language it's a
05:02 - tool we use to track changes to our code
05:04 - and collaborate with others git and
05:07 - GitHub which is a platform that hosts
05:09 - git repositories are essential for every
05:11 - developer now git has a ton of features
05:13 - but you don't need to know them all for
05:15 - everyday use think of it like the 8020
05:18 - rule 80% of the time you use 20% of
05:20 - git's features 1 to two weeks of
05:23 - practice is enough to get up and running
05:25 - now building mobile apps often involves
05:27 - working with data structures and
05:29 - implementing complex algorithms this is
05:31 - where a lot of self-taught programmers
05:33 - struggle because they try to skip ahead
05:36 - and learn more and more languages and
05:38 - tools without learning the fundamentals
05:40 - of computer science data structures and
05:42 - algorithms are critical subjects taught
05:45 - to computer science students and they're
05:47 - often covered in Tech interviews
05:49 - especially at big companies like apple
05:51 - Google and Microsoft while you can skip
05:53 - this step and go to the next as someone
05:55 - who has had the privilege of teaching
05:57 - millions of people I highly recommend
05:59 - you not to overlook this step otherwise
06:01 - you're going to feel the pain later in
06:02 - your career so spend 1 to 2 months
06:05 - studying classic data structures and
06:07 - algorithms this will give you a strong
06:09 - foundation in programming and problem
06:11 - solving the next thing I would recommend
06:13 - learning which again a lot of
06:15 - self-taught developers Miss is design
06:18 - patterns design patterns are proven
06:20 - solutions to Common software design
06:22 - problems there are 23 classic design
06:25 - patterns documented in the book design
06:27 - patterns by the gang of four many of
06:29 - these patterns are used in Mobile
06:31 - Frameworks so learning them will give
06:33 - you a deeper understanding of
06:35 - object-oriented design principles and
06:37 - how these mobile Frameworks work under
06:39 - the hood now I have to tell you this
06:41 - book is pretty old and written in C++
06:43 - honestly it's a difficult read because
06:45 - many of the examples in the book are dry
06:47 - and not quite relevant to Modern
06:49 - software that's why I've created a very
06:52 - Hands-On and pragmatic course on this
06:54 - topic where I use Java and modern
06:56 - examples found in applications we use
06:58 - every day you can see how design
07:00 - patterns are used to solve problems in
07:02 - modern applications whether you want to
07:04 - take my course or use a different
07:06 - resource I believe if you dedicate a few
07:08 - hours every day you can have a pretty
07:10 - solid understanding of design patterns
07:12 - in about 2 months all right the next
07:14 - thing you need to learn is a mobile
07:16 - framework which we talked about before
07:18 - for Dart you should learn flutter and
07:20 - for JavaScript you should learn react
07:22 - native assuming you have a solid
07:24 - background in programming you can learn
07:26 - either of these Frameworks in about 2
07:27 - months so if you dedicated a few hours
07:30 - every day and follow this road map
07:32 - you'll have the necessary knowledge to
07:34 - apply for an entry-level mobile
07:36 - developer job in about 8 to 12 months if
07:39 - you have any questions please let me
07:40 - know in the comments below I'll do my
07:42 - best to answer you right here or in my
07:44 - future videos If you enjoyed this video
