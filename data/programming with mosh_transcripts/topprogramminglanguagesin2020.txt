00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - in this video we're gonna talk about the
00:05 - top three programming languages to learn
00:07 - in 2020 whether you're an absolute
00:10 - beginner wanting to learn programming
00:12 - for the first time or you're an
00:13 - experienced developer looking for new
00:15 - job opportunities this video is for you
00:17 - I've picked these languages based on
00:19 - Google Trends and the results of various
00:22 - surveys and studies these are the most
00:24 - versatile programming languages that
00:26 - offer you the best job opportunities of
00:28 - course merely knowing a programming
00:31 - language does not land you a job you
00:33 - need to know a lot of other stuff too
00:34 - but we'll talk about that in another
00:36 - video now before we get started make
00:39 - sure to subscribe and enable
00:40 - notifications so you will get notified
00:42 - next time I upload a video
00:44 - I'm not Sharma Danny LM a software
00:46 - engineer with almost two decades of
00:48 - experience and I've taught over three
00:50 - million people how to code or how to
00:52 - become a professional software engineer
00:54 - so let's jump right in and talk about
00:56 - the top three programming languages to
00:58 - learn in 2020 Python is one of the most
01:04 - liked programming languages of all time
01:06 - here's a preview of my Python tutorial
01:08 - on YouTube this is my most popular
01:10 - tutorial and has been watched over 6
01:13 - million times since last year if you
01:15 - want to learn Python I've put the link
01:16 - down below
01:17 - according to indeed.com the average
01:19 - salary of a Python developer in the US
01:22 - is about 120 thousand dollars a year and
01:25 - here is the result of stack overflows
01:27 - developer survey in 2019 as you can see
01:30 - Python ranks as the most wanted
01:32 - programming language of the year here
01:35 - are a few reasons why Python is the most
01:37 - popular programming language in the
01:39 - world
01:39 - Python is very beginner friendly and is
01:41 - particularly easy to learn for people
01:43 - who don't want to become professional
01:45 - software engineers a lot of accountants
01:48 - engineers and scientists use Python in
01:51 - their day to day work Python is
01:53 - extremely popular for machine learning
01:55 - AI projects and research anyone who
01:57 - wants to get into machine learning na I
01:59 - should definitely learn Python
02:01 - professional software engineers also use
02:03 - Python to build web mobile and desktop
02:06 - applications but quite frankly Python is
02:08 - not very reputable when it comes to
02:10 - building mobile and desktop applications
02:12 - with
02:13 - talk about the best languages for these
02:14 - kind of applications in a moment
02:16 - Python and a framework called Django are
02:19 - very popular amongst back-end developers
02:21 - and on top of all this pythons code is
02:24 - very simple and free of clutter here's a
02:27 - snippet of Python code that asks the
02:29 - user to enter a number and then tells if
02:31 - the number is even or odd as you can see
02:34 - the syntax looks way different from
02:36 - other programming languages there are no
02:38 - curly braces no classes and no public or
02:41 - private modifiers it's extremely simple
02:43 - and free of clutter this is one of the
02:46 - reasons that Python is so appealing to a
02:48 - lot of people here's the bottom line if
02:50 - you're an absolute beginner or if you
02:52 - want to get into machine learning and AI
02:54 - Python is the best language to learn
02:56 - right now the second language on the top
03:02 - three programming languages list is Java
03:04 - why you might say seriously isn't Java
03:07 - dead what about coddling Tamwar friend
03:09 - Kotlin is a fairly new programming
03:12 - language with a small community and is
03:14 - often used for new development there are
03:16 - tens of thousands of projects already
03:18 - built with Java and these projects are
03:21 - not being migrated to coddling let's do
03:23 - some quick research on indeed.com I'm
03:26 - gonna search for Java developer in the
03:28 - US so as you can see there currently
03:31 - over 29,000 jobs for Java developers in
03:35 - the US now let's search for Cartland
03:37 - developer they're just over 1,000 jobs
03:41 - also according to a indeed.com the
03:44 - average salary of a Java developer in
03:46 - the US is 105 thousand dollars per year
03:50 - here are a few reasons why Java is one
03:52 - of the most popular programming
03:54 - languages Java is used in enterprise
03:56 - software applications
03:57 - it's used by plenty of tech companies
03:59 - around the world to build large-scale
04:02 - applications huge companies like uber
04:04 - Airbnb Twitter and many others used Java
04:07 - in their tech stack and this means that
04:09 - finding a job as a Java developer is
04:12 - relatively easy and definitely easier
04:14 - than Cartland Java is also used in
04:17 - developing native Android apps if you're
04:20 - interested in becoming a mobile
04:21 - developer focusing on building native
04:23 - Android apps then learning Java makes a
04:26 - lot of
04:26 - also Java has been a popular programming
04:29 - language for almost two decades and
04:31 - there's a huge support community but you
04:34 - start learning Java you will encounter
04:35 - tons of resources forums and books to
04:39 - help you along the way and here's my
04:41 - personal opinion about Java even if you
04:43 - don't want to become a Java developer
04:45 - simply knowing Java and understanding
04:48 - its syntax would be very beneficial
04:49 - because there are tons of great books on
04:52 - courses on software engineering that are
04:54 - based on Java most books about data
04:56 - structures algorithms design patterns
04:59 - automatic testing and software
05:01 - architecture are based on Java that is
05:03 - why in my opinion knowing Java is like
05:05 - knowing English if you understand
05:07 - English and can speak it a bit you can
05:09 - travel around the world Java in the
05:11 - programming world is like the English
05:13 - language of our world now here's the
05:15 - Python code that I showed you earlier
05:17 - let's see what this code looks like in
05:19 - Java
05:20 - obviously the code is more verbose it's
05:23 - longer that's why learning Java could be
05:25 - slightly difficult for people who have
05:27 - never programmed before and here's the
05:29 - bottom line if you're serious about
05:31 - software development and building
05:33 - enterprise applications Java is the best
05:36 - language to learn the next top
05:40 - programming language to learn in 2020 is
05:43 - JavaScript for the seventh year in a row
05:45 - javascript has ranked as the most
05:47 - popular programming language in a survey
05:49 - conducted by Stack Overflow
05:51 - according to indeed.com the average
05:54 - salary of a JavaScript developer in the
05:56 - US is 114 thousand dollars per year just
06:00 - like Python and Java javascript is also
06:03 - a versatile language which means we can
06:06 - use it to build various types of web
06:08 - mobile and desktop applications but
06:10 - JavaScript really shines in web and
06:12 - mobile application development using
06:15 - javascript and react native you can
06:17 - build cross-platform mobile apps so
06:19 - instead of building a separate app for
06:21 - iOS or Android and maintaining two
06:24 - different code bases you write your
06:26 - application once in JavaScript and build
06:28 - it for different platforms you have a
06:30 - single codebase to maintain that's why a
06:33 - lot of companies these days prefer to
06:35 - build apps this way because of the
06:36 - reduced cost of course if you want to
06:38 - leverage the full
06:40 - our of a platform like iOS or Android
06:42 - you should build apps using the native
06:44 - language and frameworks with that
06:46 - platform for iOS that is Swift and for
06:49 - Android that is Java but again most
06:51 - companies prefer cross-platform
06:53 - solutions and that's why the more job
06:56 - opportunities for JavaScript and react
06:58 - native developer compared with Swift
07:01 - developer JavaScript also has a huge
07:03 - community and whenever you get stuck
07:05 - there plenty of people out there who
07:06 - could help you and here's the bottom
07:08 - line if you want to become a web
07:10 - developer or if you want to build
07:12 - cross-platform mobile apps
07:13 - you should learn JavaScript so let's
07:15 - quickly recap the top three programming
07:18 - languages to learn in 2020 are Python
07:20 - Java and JavaScript Python is best
07:24 - suited for machine learning and AI Java
07:26 - is best suited for building enterprise
07:28 - applications and javascript is the
07:30 - language of choice for building web or
07:32 - cross-platform mobile apps if you want
07:34 - to learn any of these languages I've put
07:36 - links down below
07:37 - I have tutorials for you here on my
07:38 - channel and if you want to learn more I
07:40 - have complete courses that go way beyond
07:43 - the tutorials on this channel all my
07:45 - courses come with a 30-day money-back
07:46 - guarantee and a certificate of
07:48 - completion that you can add your resume
07:50 - with all that what programming language
07:52 - do you want to learn in 2020 let me know
07:55 - in the comment section below if you
07:57 - enjoyed this video please like and share
07:59 - it with others thank you for watching
