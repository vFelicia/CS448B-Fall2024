00:00 - hey guys Smosh here I'm super excited to
00:02 - announce that the second part of my data
00:04 - structures and algorithms series is out
00:06 - in the first part we talked about the
00:08 - linear data structures such as arrays
00:10 - link lists stacks queues and hash tables
00:13 - in this part we're going to talk about
00:15 - the nonlinear data structures so you're
00:17 - gonna learn all about binary trees AVL
00:19 - trees heaps tries and graphs this series
00:23 - is packed with tons of interview
00:24 - questions and step-by-step solutions
00:27 - it's a must for anyone who is preparing
00:28 - for a coding interview or anyone who
00:30 - wants to become a better programmer
00:32 - because it teaches you problem-solving
00:34 - skills it teaches you how to design fast
00:36 - and scalable algorithms had tons of
00:39 - requests for this course because data
00:41 - structures is one of the topics that
00:42 - comes up in job interviews quite a lot
00:45 - especially if you're looking for a job
00:46 - at big companies like Microsoft Google
00:49 - and Amazon these companies always ask
00:52 - you questions about data structures and
00:54 - algorithms to see if you can think like
00:56 - a programmer they don't care how many
00:58 - programming languages or frameworks
01:00 - you're familiar with if you can build a
01:02 - website or an app but cannot solve a
01:04 - basic computer science problem you're
01:06 - gonna fail and that's exactly why I
01:08 - created this course for you to help your
01:10 - master is very important topic every
01:13 - single exercise an example you see in
01:14 - this course is a popular interview
01:17 - question I'm super excited about this
01:19 - course and I wish when I was learning
01:21 - this topic back at school we had a
01:23 - course like this because most data
01:25 - structure books and courses out there
01:26 - are super pouring and dry plus the code
01:30 - you see in this books look disgusting
01:31 - you see a lot of mysterious variables
01:33 - like n K a and B and you have no idea
01:37 - how these algorithms work in this course
01:40 - not only will you learn everything about
01:41 - data structures on algorithms but you
01:44 - will also learn how to implement these
01:45 - algorithms with beautiful code the color
01:48 - code that can be read like your story
01:50 - you will see how I start with a simple
01:52 - solution then refactor my code and make
01:54 - it better and more expressive this
01:57 - course is a must for any computer
01:59 - science students whose lecture failed to
02:01 - explain these topics as well as people
02:03 - who want to get a software development
02:04 - job at a good company or I would say
02:07 - anyone who simply wants to become a
02:09 - better developer because these
02:11 - algorithms we have covered in this
02:13 - course
02:13 - train your programming brain they change
02:15 - how you think about programming so if
02:18 - you're interested in this course you can
02:19 - get it on my coding school code with
02:21 - mass comm this course just got launched
02:24 - and the first 200 students can get it
02:26 - with a discount if you're interested
02:28 - click the link below this video thank
02:30 - you and have a fantastic day
02:34 - [Music]
