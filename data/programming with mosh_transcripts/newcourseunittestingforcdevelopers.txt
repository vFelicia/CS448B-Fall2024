00:01 - welcome to unit testing for c-sharp
00:03 - developers my name is Mohamad ani and I
00:06 - have taught over 140,000 students around
00:09 - the world chances are you've heard of
00:11 - unit testing but you're not sure how
00:13 - powerful it is or perhaps you've tried
00:15 - it and it didn't work for you it's a
00:18 - skill that every senior developer must
00:21 - have unit tests help you get instant
00:24 - feedback on your code to see if it
00:26 - really works
00:27 - this means we can catch bugs before you
00:30 - release your software so ultimately you
00:33 - will save time effort and money in this
00:36 - course I'm going to take you on a
00:38 - journey to master unit testing but in a
00:40 - fraction of the time it took me I read
00:43 - several books watch tons of videos and
00:45 - tried various approaches to write unit
00:48 - tests some failed some worked what you
00:51 - find in this course is the result of
00:52 - years of my experience packed with best
00:55 - practices real-world examples and
00:58 - exercises so by the end of watching this
01:00 - course you'll be able to write great
01:02 - unit tests that help you release better
01:05 - quality software with less bugs more
01:08 - specifically you'll learn what to test
01:10 - and how tips and tricks to write clean
01:13 - and reliable tests the pitfalls to avoid
01:16 - how to refactor a legacy code into
01:18 - loosely coupled and testable code all
01:21 - about dependency injection and mocks and
01:23 - much much more
01:24 - so click the enroll button to get
01:27 - instant lifetime access to the course
01:29 - and here's my promise to you if you're
