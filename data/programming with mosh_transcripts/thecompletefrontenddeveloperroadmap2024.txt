00:00 - in this video I'm going to lay out a
00:02 - complete road map of the essential
00:04 - skills you need to become a frontend
00:05 - developer whether you're a beginner
00:07 - wanting to know what to learn to land a
00:09 - frontend developer job or someone with
00:11 - some experience looking to level up your
00:13 - skills and filling the gaps this video
00:15 - is for you we'll cover what each skill
00:18 - is why it's important and a realistic
00:20 - timeline for learning it ready let's
00:22 - dive in web development is generally
00:24 - broken down into two areas front end
00:26 - development and backend development and
00:28 - then full stack development which is a
00:30 - combination of both front end
00:32 - development is all about what the user
00:34 - sees and interacts with it's the website
00:36 - in your browser or the app on your
00:38 - mobile phone or tablet backend
00:40 - development handles everything behind
00:42 - the scenes like data processing storage
00:44 - and logic in this video our focus is
00:47 - only on frontend development I'm
00:48 - planning to create a similar video on
00:50 - backend development so check the
00:52 - description box for the link now before
00:54 - we get started let's answer a common
00:56 - question how long does it take to become
00:58 - a front-end developer well the answer
01:00 - varies for everyone but it can take
01:01 - anywhere from 6 to 12 months of
01:04 - consistent studying and practice the key
01:06 - here is consistency and continuous
01:08 - learning to help you on this journey
01:10 - I've created a free supplementary PDF
01:13 - that breaks down the specific Concepts
01:15 - you need to learn for each skill it also
01:17 - includes several project ideas to help
01:19 - you practice and apply what you have
01:21 - learned it's a great resource to review
01:23 - your progress find gaps in your
01:25 - knowledge and prepare for interviews you
01:27 - can find the link in the description box
01:29 - now let's talk about about the essential
01:30 - languages and Technologies you need to
01:32 - learn front and development is built on
01:34 - Three core languages HTML CSS and
01:37 - JavaScript HTML or hypertext markup
01:40 - language is used for structuring web
01:42 - pages we can Define headings paragraphs
01:45 - images links and more it's quite simple
01:47 - and if you dedicate a few hours a day
01:49 - you can learn the basics in a week or
01:51 - two by the way I have a bunch of
01:53 - tutorials on this channel and complete
01:55 - courses on my website if you're looking
01:56 - for structured Learning Links are in the
01:58 - description box then next thing you need
02:00 - to learn is CSS or cascading stylesheets
02:03 - CSS is used for styling web pages it
02:06 - allows us to control colors fonts
02:08 - layouts and so on it helps create
02:10 - responsive designs that adapt to
02:12 - different screen sizes with a few hours
02:14 - of practice a day you can learn the
02:16 - essence of CSS in 2 to 4 weeks you won't
02:19 - be an expert but you'll have practical
02:21 - knowledge to apply in your projects as
02:23 - you work on different projects you will
02:24 - learn additional techniques along the
02:26 - way the next thing you need to learn is
02:28 - Javascript and this is is where
02:30 - programming starts HTML and CSS are for
02:33 - structuring and styling pages but
02:35 - programming is about logic it's about
02:37 - algorithms and this is where JavaScript
02:39 - comes in with JavaScript we can make our
02:41 - web pages interactive we can handle user
02:44 - clicks validate form data show popups
02:47 - get data from the back end and basically
02:49 - bring our website to life now if you
02:51 - have never programmed before this might
02:52 - be the most challenging part of your
02:54 - journey because you have to learn how to
02:56 - think like a programmer it might feel
02:57 - weird at the beginning but with Contin
03:00 - study and consistent practice I'm sure
03:02 - you can get a reasonable grasp of it in
03:04 - about 2 months again I have a bunch of
03:06 - tutorials on this channel and complete
03:08 - courses on my website if you prefer
03:10 - structured Learning Links are in the
03:11 - description box now as we code we need a
03:14 - way to track changes and collaborate
03:16 - with others that's where Version Control
03:18 - Systems particularly git come into play
03:21 - git isn't a programming language it's a
03:23 - tool that allows us to track changes to
03:25 - our code and revert to previous versions
03:27 - GitHub on the other hand is one of the
03:29 - many platforms that hosts G repositories
03:32 - enabling us to share our code with
03:34 - others and work in a team environment
03:36 - both skid and GitHub are essential for
03:38 - every developer G has a ton of features
03:40 - but you don't need to know them all for
03:42 - everyday use think of it like the 8020
03:44 - rule 80% of the time you use 20% of gits
03:47 - features one to two weeks of practice is
03:50 - enough to get up and running the next
03:52 - thing you need to learn is typescript
03:54 - it's a language that's built on top of
03:56 - JavaScript that adds static typing and
03:58 - additional feature allowing us to write
04:00 - more robust code these days most
04:03 - companies prefer typescript for large
04:05 - scale applications so if you want to
04:07 - land a front and developer job in 2024
04:09 - and Beyond typescript is a must know
04:12 - it's relatively small compared to
04:14 - JavaScript and you can get up and
04:15 - running in about 2 to 3 weeks next on
04:18 - our list is a UI or user interface
04:21 - library or framework a UI framework is
04:24 - for building user interfaces using
04:26 - reusable components or building blocks
04:29 - examples incl include react angular View
04:31 - and so on react is the most popular and
04:33 - has a ton of job opportunities so if
04:35 - you're looking to land a front and
04:37 - developer job react is your best bet now
04:39 - to learn react effectively you need to
04:41 - have a solid understanding of JavaScript
04:44 - and basic grasp of typescript because
04:46 - most react projects these days use
04:48 - typescript so make sure to build a
04:51 - strong foundation in JavaScript before
04:53 - diving into react otherwise you're going
04:54 - to face numerous challenges with a solid
04:57 - understanding of JavaScript you can get
04:59 - up and running with react in about 2
05:01 - months then you can explore other
05:02 - options like angular or view to add to
05:05 - your resume focus on one framework at a
05:07 - time learn it properly do a few projects
05:10 - and once you have a solid understanding
05:12 - you can learn other Frameworks if you
05:13 - wish so that's the core of front and
05:16 - development these skills are listed on
05:18 - nearly every job description and with
05:20 - continuous learning and consistent
05:22 - practice you can learn them all in about
05:24 - 6 months but I'm going to be honest with
05:26 - you front and development is competitive
05:28 - so to truly stand out there are
05:30 - additional skills you need to learn to
05:32 - increase your job opportunities so let's
05:34 - go over them one by one you learn that
05:36 - with CSS we can style web pages and make
05:39 - them beautiful now as our projects grow
05:42 - and get more complex styling Pages using
05:44 - plain CSS can become painful and messy
05:47 - so over time many solutions have been
05:49 - created to address this problem one of
05:51 - them is CSS pre-processors which allow
05:54 - us to write CSS in a more efficient
05:56 - syntax using additional features and
05:59 - then compile it down to plain CSS
06:01 - examples include SAS Les and stylus
06:04 - different projects use different tools
06:06 - and you don't need to learn all of these
06:08 - to apply for a frontend developer job if
06:10 - you're familiar with one of them you can
06:12 - quickly learn others on the job out of
06:14 - these I would suggest SAS because it's
06:16 - the most popular and a good one to start
06:18 - with one to two weeks is enough to get
06:21 - up and running with SAS another approach
06:23 - to writing manageable CSS is using a CSS
06:26 - framework a CSS framework provides
06:28 - pre-written CSS that we can use in our
06:31 - applications some of the popular ones
06:33 - are bootstrap Tailwind Foundation
06:35 - skeleton and so on now as you can see
06:37 - here on npm Trends bootstrap used to be
06:40 - very popular and a lot of projects are
06:42 - still using it but over the past couple
06:44 - of years Tailwind has been emerging and
06:47 - overtaking bootstrap so a lot of newer
06:49 - projects particularly react projects use
06:52 - Tailwind so out of these I recommend
06:54 - learning Tailwind it's not that
06:56 - complicated and you can get a decent
06:58 - grasp of it in about two to 4 weeks
07:00 - another key skill that employers are
07:02 - looking for especially in senior
07:04 - developers is automated testing with
07:07 - automated testing we can write code to
07:09 - test our code and make sure it functions
07:11 - correctly automated testing minimizes
07:14 - bugs and enhances the overall quality of
07:16 - our applications there are many testing
07:18 - Frameworks out there but the two most
07:20 - popular ones are just and vest which are
07:23 - pretty similar so once you learn one of
07:25 - them you can learn the other pretty
07:27 - quickly just is the most popular one but
07:29 - but it has some baggage so newer
07:31 - projects often use vest again they're
07:34 - very similar and you can start with
07:35 - either of them I believe 3 to four weeks
07:38 - is enough to learn the essence of just
07:40 - and automated testing principles next on
07:43 - our list is meta Frameworks a meta
07:45 - framework is a higher level framework
07:47 - that sits on top of a core UI library or
07:50 - framework and enhances its capabilities
07:53 - it's not something that all employers
07:55 - are looking for because it's only used
07:57 - in newer projects a lot of older
07:59 - projects don't use a meta framework but
08:01 - if you want to have a Competitive Edge
08:03 - if you're looking for a better position
08:05 - with a better salary I would recommend
08:07 - learning a meta framework for react
08:09 - applications we have nextjs which is the
08:11 - more popular option and remix I
08:14 - recommend learning nextjs which you can
08:16 - master in four to 6 weeks if you have a
08:18 - strong foundation in react now if you
08:21 - want to get into Mobile development and
08:22 - further increase your job opportunities
08:25 - learn react native it's a framework for
08:27 - building crossplatform mobile apps using
08:29 - react if you have a solid understanding
08:31 - of React 2 months is enough to get a
08:34 - good grasp of react native so that
08:36 - really sums up the essential skills you
08:38 - need to become a frontend developer if
08:40 - you have any questions please let me
08:42 - know in the comments below and I will do
08:44 - my best to answer you right here or in
08:46 - my future videos If you enjoyed this
