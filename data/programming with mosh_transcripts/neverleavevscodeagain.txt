00:00 - I see a lot of people constantly switch
00:02 - back and forth between vs code and
00:04 - multiple terminal windows so let me show
00:06 - you a better way here in vs code we have
00:08 - an integrated terminal that we can bring
00:10 - up by pressing control and back tick
00:13 - back tick is the character before number
00:15 - one on your keyboard so here's our
00:17 - terminal window we can also have
00:19 - multiple windows and switch between them

00:23 - the back end another for the front end
00:25 - another for running tests and one more
00:27 - for running our git commands follow me
