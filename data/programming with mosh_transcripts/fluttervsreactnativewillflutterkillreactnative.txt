00:00 - in this video we're gonna talk about
00:02 - react native versus flutter will flutter
00:04 - killed react native let's find out
00:10 - hi i'm mohammed ani and i've taught
00:13 - millions of people how to become
00:14 - professional software engineers through
00:16 - this channel and my coding school in
00:18 - this video i'm gonna compare react
00:20 - native with flutter and then towards the
00:22 - end i'm gonna give you my unbiased
00:24 - opinion about which one you should learn
00:26 - from mobile developer so react native
00:28 - and flutter are the two top frameworks
00:30 - or building mobile apps for iOS and
00:32 - Android react native is created by
00:34 - Facebook and has been around since 2015
00:37 - here are five apps that are built with
00:39 - react native Facebook Instagram
00:41 - Pinterest Skype uber EADS and many many
00:45 - more
00:45 - flutter is created by Google it's a
00:47 - neuro framework that came out in 2018
00:49 - here are three apps built with flutter
00:51 - Google at Alibaba realtor.com and of
00:55 - course many many more as you can see on
00:57 - Google Trends flutter has gained a lot
00:59 - of popularity recently and has overtaken
01:02 - react native that's because a lot of
01:04 - people are curious about flutter I want
01:06 - to learn it having said that at the time
01:08 - of recording this video there are not as
01:09 - many job opportunities for flutter
01:11 - developers if you do a quick search on
01:13 - indeed calm or your favorite job
01:15 - searching website you can verify this
01:17 - yourself indeed calm they're currently
01:20 - 250 jobs for react native developers in
01:23 - California compared to 42 jobs for
01:25 - flutter
01:26 - that's because react native has been
01:27 - around for much longer than flutter even
01:30 - though Google has invested a lot in
01:32 - developing and improving flutter react
01:34 - native is more mature and stable so it
01:36 - has a higher adoption rate now where you
01:39 - live these numbers might be different
01:40 - and there may be more job opportunities
01:42 - for flutter developers so don't just
01:44 - relate on what I tell you do your own
01:46 - research and see which framework has a
01:48 - better job market now in terms of
01:51 - programming languages react native uses
01:53 - JavaScript so if you're a web developer
01:54 - and no JavaScript react native is the
01:57 - most straightforward path for you to get
01:59 - into mobile development flutter on the
02:01 - other hand uses dart which is a new
02:03 - object-oriented programming language
02:05 - created by Google it's very similar to
02:07 - Java and JavaScript in terms of syntax
02:09 - so if you know Java JavaScript or C
02:12 - sharp you can quickly get up
02:13 - sweet with dart I think dart is a
02:15 - beautiful language that has taken the
02:17 - best ideas from different programming
02:19 - languages however it's still new in the
02:21 - developer community whereas javascript
02:23 - has been around for a very long time and
02:25 - has a huge community there are lots of
02:28 - books courses articles developers and
02:31 - millions of lines of JavaScript code we
02:33 - can use in our apps darts still new and
02:36 - growing its community now one of the
02:38 - selling points of flutter is that it
02:40 - comes with a comprehensive library of
02:42 - beautiful UI widgets so for any kind of
02:44 - app you want to build there are many
02:46 - beautiful widgets available right out of
02:48 - the box that's not the case with react
02:50 - native you have to reach out to
02:51 - third-party libraries so building and
02:54 - shipping apps with flutter can be faster
02:56 - but of course that really depends on the
02:58 - developer skills overall I think both
03:01 - react native and flutter are great here
03:03 - on my channel I have a comprehensive to
03:05 - our tutorial on react native but I'm
03:07 - creating a similar one for flutter by
03:09 - the time you watch this video my flutter
03:11 - tutorial might even be ready so check
03:13 - the description box below for the links
03:15 - now should you invest your time and
03:17 - energy and react native or flutter well
03:19 - here's my guidelines first of all ask
03:21 - yourself why you want to learn react
03:23 - native or flutter think about your goal
03:25 - do you wanna learn mobile development to
03:27 - get a job or do you have an idea for an
03:29 - app and want to turn that idea into a
03:31 - reality your goal will determine the
03:33 - framework you need to learn if your goal
03:35 - is to get a good job with a good salary
03:36 - the job market determines whether you
03:38 - should learn react native or flutter so
03:41 - look at the number of jobs advertised
03:42 - where you live don't listen to people
03:44 - telling you you should learn this or
03:45 - that do your own research and decide
03:48 - based on data on the other hand if your
03:50 - goal is to build an app then the job
03:52 - market doesn't matter anymore
03:53 - what matters is time to market being
03:56 - able to quickly build and shape your app
03:58 - if you know JavaScript well and you also
04:01 - happen to know react then react native
04:03 - is the fastest way for you to get into
04:05 - mobile developer react native is based
04:07 - on react so everything you know about
04:09 - react also applies in react native you
04:11 - just have to learn some additional stuff
04:13 - on the other hand if you don't know
04:15 - JavaScript then you might want to
04:17 - consider a flutter because all you have
04:19 - to learn to get started is the dart
04:21 - language and flutter itself it's faster
04:23 - than learning JavaScript yeah
04:25 - and react native again if you want to
04:28 - learn react native or flutter look in
04:29 - the description box below for my YouTube
04:31 - tutorials so do you want to learn react
04:34 - native or flutter let me know in the
