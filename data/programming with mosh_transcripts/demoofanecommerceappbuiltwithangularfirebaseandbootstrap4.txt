00:03 - we're gonna build an e-commerce
00:05 - application for an imaginary organic
00:09 - shop so here on the home page we have
00:11 - master detail we can select a category
00:14 - and see all the products in that
00:18 - category you can add a product to our
00:21 - shopping cart change the quantity and
00:25 - the number of items in a shopping cart
00:28 - gets updated in real time and here's our
00:32 - shopping cart again here we can change
00:36 - the quantity for each item and the total
00:40 - price as well as the total number of
00:42 - items in the shopping cart get updated
00:45 - immediately if I open another tab and
00:49 - add another product to our shopping cart
00:51 - what we have on the shopping cart tab
00:54 - gets updated automatically without me
00:58 - having to refresh the page so all the
01:00 - data we show to the user is in sync
01:03 - everywhere in the application and this
01:06 - is the beauty of a real-time application
01:09 - now let's check out here we have a
01:13 - shipping form and the summary of all the
01:16 - products in our shopping cart and again
01:19 - this summary gets updated as soon as I
01:21 - make a change or a shopping cart in
01:24 - another tab once we place this order it
01:28 - will be visible to our admins so I'm an
01:31 - admin user and I have this menu here
01:34 - manage orders here we can see all the
01:37 - orders in the application other users
01:41 - will not see this page here so here we
01:44 - have authentication and authorization as
01:48 - an admin I can also manage the products
01:50 - so here we have all the crud operations
01:54 - we can quickly search for a product
01:58 - you can sort the data resize the columns
02:02 - or navigate to a different page these
02:08 - are the patterns that you see in a lot
02:10 - of real-world applications and in this
02:13 - course you're going to learn how to
02:15 - implement these patterns in your
02:17 - applications
