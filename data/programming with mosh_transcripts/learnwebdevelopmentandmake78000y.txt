02:58 - well programming is not for you i'm just
03:01 - being honest with you
03:04 - now do you need a degree well it depends
03:07 - companies like apple and google
03:08 - don't care about your degree as long as
03:10 - you can demonstrate that you have the
03:12 - required skills
03:13 - i have a master's degree plus a bunch of
03:16 - microsoft certifications
03:17 - but none of my previous employers ever
03:19 - asked me for those papers
03:21 - but there are other companies out there
03:23 - that require you to have a degree in
03:25 - computer science or software engineering
03:28 - in my opinion a good employer should
03:30 - care about your skills and knowledge
03:32 - and not a piece of paper so in reality
03:35 - yes there are companies that require you
03:37 - to have a degree but there are many
03:38 - other companies that don't care about
03:40 - your degree
03:41 - as long as you can demonstrate your
03:42 - skills
03:45 - okay now let's talk about what you need
03:47 - to learn to become a web developer
03:49 - well first you need to decide what kind
03:51 - of web development you want to do
03:53 - every website has two parts a front end
03:55 - and a back end
03:56 - the front end is the part that you see
03:58 - in your browser and interact with
04:00 - all the visual aspects the backend is
04:03 - the part that powers the front hand
04:05 - it's behind the scenes and is mainly
04:06 - about storing data in databases
04:08 - and providing it to the front end so web
04:11 - development jobs
04:12 - fall into three main categories
04:14 - front-end development
04:15 - back-end development and full-stack
04:17 - development which involves both
04:19 - front-end
04:20 - and back-end development if you're
04:21 - starting out you should just focus
04:23 - on front-end or back-end full-stack
04:25 - development is something you want to
04:27 - consider after you've been in the
04:28 - industry for at least a year or two
04:31 - now what is easier front-end or back-end
04:33 - development well
04:35 - it really depends who you ask some
04:37 - people find front-end development pretty
04:39 - straightforward
04:40 - whereas other people are more
04:41 - comfortable with back-end development
04:43 - as part of this series i'm going to give
04:45 - you exposure to both these areas of web
04:47 - development
04:48 - so you can decide what resonates best
04:50 - with you in the next two episodes
04:52 - we're going to talk about the specific
04:54 - skills you need to know to become
