hi guys my name is emily and i'm going to be your python instructor for today so in the last video jason left you guys off with downloading python and pycharm to your own computers so if you haven't done that already make sure you go watch that video first so today we're going to be learning about print statements and how we print out messages to the screen so to print the screen there is only one command which is print followed by a pair of parentheses so inside the parentheses is where you write what you want to print to the console and i'll get to what the console means in just a bit you must put your statement in quotes inside the parentheses and you can use either double quotes or single quotes if you have no apostrophes in your message you'll use single quotes so for example if i wanted to print the word hi there are no apostrophes in that word so i'm going to surround it with single quotes however if you have a statement with apostrophes for example it's there's an apostrophe right here we're going to surround our message with double quotes um however you cannot use both a single and a double quote so for example uh we cannot do double quotes high single quote you have to use either double quotes or single quotes so let's see what the print command looks like so let's say i wanted to print the phrase hello world shown right here so i'm going to hop over to the pycharm ide so i'm going to quickly go over how we uh make a new python file so we're going to find our project that we made and we're going to right click it and click new python file and then you can name it whatever you want so i'm going to name this printing now we have a new python file so we wanted to print hello world hello world does not have any apostrophes in it so we're going to use single quotes so first i'm going to start with writing the print command so print parentheses and notice how pycharm automatically completes this ending parenthesis it makes our lives a lot easier so we're going to use single quotes and then in between the two quotes we're going to write our message so hello world and let's run that and see what happens you can click the green run button up here or you can right click and there should be an option to run so what pops up on the bottom here is our console which is the place where all our messages are displayed so if we look inside the console we can see that hello world was printed out let's say i wanted to um print out the phrase hi on emily um so we're going to write another print command and let's think so hi i'm emily has an apostrophe right here in the word i'm so we're going to surround the entire message with double quotes so hi i'm emily i'm gonna print that and see what happens and hi i'm emily shows up right here so notice how after hello world it jumped to a new line to print hi i'm emily and that's because we used a new print statement so every time we write another print statement it automatically jumps to the next slide another thing to note here is um notice how there is this uh blank line right here of just white space in our code but then when we run it there is no white space in between that's because our code does not care about white space so i could put like 100 lines of white line of white uh white space in between these two print statements and the same exact thing would print out so if i ran it the same thing prints out so let's say i wanted to print out this phrase right here which is double quote what's up double quote with the quotes um so let's write another print command let's try using single quotes and see what happens so single quote and then our message which is double quote what's up double quote and then i'm gonna surround it with single quotes so our message is right here and it's surrounded by single quotes then a red underline pops up which means that there is an error in our code um let's see why so we used a single quote but then there was an apotrophy in our statement so python thinks that this apostrophe is our ending quote so everything after it over here is not inside the quotes so let's try using double quotes to surround our message so look at this so our message is here and it's surrounded by two double quotes but there's still an error so let's see why um we use the double quote but then we have another double quote here so python thinks that this that this quote is our starting quote and this is our ending quote so everything here everything after here is not inside the quotes so what can we do if we can't use single quotes or double quotes well there's a special key we can use so first we're going to surround our message with single quotes so message is right inside of here and it's surrounded by single quotes and right before the apostrophe in our message we're going to use a backslash which is right above the enter or return key so it looks like that and our red line goes away let's try printing it and see what happens and it prints out exactly the way i wanted it to so next we're going to go into commenting so not everything in your code has to be actual code you can also have comments which are english statements that are not recognized as code and do not run so to comment we're going to type a number sign followed by a space and then our message or comment um so let's see what this looks like in pycharm sorry um let's say i wanted to print i wanted to comment these three lines of code and um so i'm going to uh write a number sign followed by a space and i'm going to write these are some print statements and let's run that and see what happens the same thing prints out as if i did not have this comment here this comment is not code so why do we use comments well this is helpful to document your code especially when it becomes more complex and confusing and explaining it in comments is necessary so that you know you're doing later on when you look back at your projects and that other people who are reading your code know that know what you are doing so that takes us to our printing and commenting exercises so you're going to use the print command that we learned today and you're going to print at least seven statements about yourself um just like i have here and then after you finish that you're going to put a comment on the first line so at the very beginning of your code and you're going to tell us what your code does using a comment so that's it for today and i'll see you guys next time
