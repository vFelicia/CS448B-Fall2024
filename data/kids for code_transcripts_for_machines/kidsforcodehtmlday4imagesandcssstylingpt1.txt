hi guys my name is victoria and today i'll be your html instructor today we're going to learn about images and a little bit about styling with css before we get started we're going to review the summary questions from the last video so number one what is the difference between ol and ul the ol tag is used for ordered lists and the ul tag is used for unordered lists number two what is the tag used for a list item the li tag is used for list items number three write the code for a link to your school's website so here i have the a tag or the opening a tag and for href the href attribute i've put the url to my school's website and lastly i've put the name i want to give the link which is also just the name of my school number four what is something you should keep in mind when creating links to other web pages you created so other web pages or your html pages they have to be in the same folder in order for the links to work great so now we're going to get started on adding images to our web page first we're going to start off with the image tag and the image tag is an empty tag which means it doesn't have a closing tag inside we have the source attribute which is the file name and extension of the picture the file name is here and the extension is a jpeg and next we have the width and the height of the picture in pixels and lastly we have alt or the alternate name for the picture this is a short description of the picture in words so where should the files be located although we're putting pictures on our webpage they're actually still stored separate from the page if the source name is just the name and extension of the image then the image just sits directly next to the web page but in the same folder this is crucial the image has to be in the same folder as your html page but if you decide to put your image in a folder that's also in the same folder as the html page you also have to specify the name of the folder and a slash before you put the name of the image in its extension so before we move on we're going to do a little demonstration so we can get used to putting images on our website so right now my image or my page actually looks like this so here i've written here's a picture i took so we're going to put an image that i took in the space below so we're going to go back to our code and under where i've written this i'm going to start off with the image tag and now we have to give the source name so i'm going to go back to my folder and see i've already downloaded my picture and i've given it a name diamond beach and it's in the same folder as my page which is my html page so we're going to go back and we know that this is a jpg file that's the extension the extension will be dot jpg so we're going to type in the name of the file and then the extension next we're going to give the width and the height so i know that the picture i took is a rectangular picture a vertical rectangle so i'm going to make sure my width is slightly less than my height so the width i'm going to give 200 or yes 200 pixels and the height will be 300 pixels so lastly we're going to give it an alternate name so i'm just going to name it diamond h which is also just the name of my file and then closing bracket so we're going to save this and go back to our page we got the image here so actually you might be wondering what is the purpose of alt since we can see that on the page we don't even see the name that we gave it well if we go back if for some reason um the page can't access the image so um let's just say that instead of beach i just put typo so now with this name this image doesn't exist because i need my image diamond beach so in this case if we go back again we will see that inside of the picture we have the alternate name that we gave it so that's actually the reason that we give it a name so now we're going to go back and images as links believe it or not we can also make images into links for a normal link we would specify what word or words we want to show up on the web page so for this example we have the url for google and then we just called the link google to make an image into a link it's actually very simple we just place the image tag containing our image inside the a tag where the word would usually be so right now on my page um i'll have to go back and fix the typo okay so right now i have a link here kids for code and then the picture so if i wanted to turn my picture into a link we're going to go back to our code and my link is actually right here and i've named it kids4code but if i wanted to make the picture into a link i'm going to actually take this entire line copy it and then instead of kids for code i'm going to put the image tag so now we're going to go back and when we click on our image it takes us to the website isn't that cool okay so let's move on css styling all right we're going to learn how to style our web page using css css can actually be added in three different ways which is the inline internal and external styles for today's lesson we're going to learn the internal style which is done inside the style tags on the head section of our page so right here we have our style tags and i've actually already added some um since you noticed that my page has a little color in the background and the title is in the center of the page so we're going to learn how to do that so the internal style sheet you define your styles in the actual html page so yes this is our html code and we're just going to do the css on the same document and it only applies to that page um so inside the style tags we're going to have css rules a css rule consists of a css selector and one or more properties and their values which you get to decide and this statement right here that contains the property and the value is called a declaration so here we have the declaration syntax you should have the property a colon then the value and then a semicolon so first we're going to experiment with the color of the text so this property is just called color very simple and the value is going to be a hex color code or just one of the color constants that brackets offers so here we have the hex color code for red but in brackets you could also just type the word red so we're going to go back to our code and i'm going to try to change this heading right here into red so i'm gonna go here and i'm just gonna write red so now if we go back to our page the titles turn red very simple next we're going to do the color behind this text or this is basically just a highlight as you would do in a document so this property is background color again very simple straightforward names and the value again will be a hex color code for one of the color constants that brackets offers so if i were to go back and i wanted to add a color behind my heading i'm going to say background color and then let's say i just want the background to be green type green and then go back we can see that the entire line has been highlighted green very simple next the text size and this uh this property is font size so not text size it's actually font size which may be a little confusing and the value is a number value in pixels there are also other units but we'll do that later on so the font size actually for h1 through h6 the headings they actually all have their default sizes so for h1 actually the default size is 36 pixels and down here h3 the default size is actually 24 pixels so if i actually wanted my text to be a little larger than it already is i'm going to write font size and let's just make it 50 pixels save that we're gonna go back so this is the size it is now and since we've made it bigger yep so our title has gotten bigger and that's it very soon um next we have the font weight the properties is called font weight notice that all of these like font size background color the ones that have multiple words in them they all are separated by a hyphen so don't forget that so for font weight we have a number values that we can do it ranges from 100 to 900 100 being the lightest and 900 being the fullest but they're also um they're also words that you can use in brackets so we're going to go back the default for h1 is actually bolder so if i wanted my title to be a little thinner we're going to use font weight and then we're going to say maybe 200. let's go back and now we can see the text has gotten significantly lighter it's thinner and that's just what font way it is it controls just how bold you want your text to be okay so lastly we have font choice which is just the font of your text and this property is flat family again separated by a hyphen so for the value we have um generalized fonts which includes cursive fantasy monospace sansserif and serif and then we have specific fonts like you would see in google docs or microsoft word like arial time sync roman etc um google fonts is a great resource for this so you can access google fonts from your browser just by searching it up and we can see that there are a bunch of fonts here and so many fonts to choose from so i'm just going to demonstrate a little how you can use this we're going to choose one font let's go with let's go with this one so we're going to click on here and to use this font we're going to do you see right here this plus and select this style we're going to click on this and click on embed so it's going to tell you that you have to copy this section of code into the head of your html which we're going to do so right here under head i'm just going to paste it at the top the link okay and then we're going to go back and see they have they've already written the line of code for us font family and sriracha cursive so we're actually going to just copy this section and where we want our text to be that font which is the heading again we're going to paste it here save it and now we're going to go back to our page and see what happens so yeah we've got this font which we saw on the website it's the same font so yeah google font is a very good resource there are a bunch of fonts you can use just remember that when you use it you have to follow these steps go um so again when you get to this site you're gonna go select this style um and then click on embed you're going to copy this into your head and then this into your css rule where you want the font to be this so we're font go back so that's it for today's lesson here are some review questions um the answers to these questions can be found all throughout the video so if you're following along you should easily be able to answer these questions um so that's it for today thank you for listening and i'll see you next time
