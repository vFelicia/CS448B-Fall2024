hi guys welcome back to kids for code so today we're going to do day two of our java beginners class so it's about hello world and printing and hello world is a program that you guys are going to be writing yourselves today so in order to write this program we're gonna need eclipse which you guys should have downloaded in the last video if you don't have that done yet it's okay go watch that video first and then come back here where you can write hello world so we're gonna go to our desktop to go to our Eclipse and we should have Eclipse saved to our desktop here and where you can double click it if you don't see Eclipse on your desktop you can go to the folder where you downloaded Eclipse and then double click it here if you still can't find it now you can go to search it and type eclipse in your search bar and you should find it here too so now we're gonna go to eclipse and we started this program last time HelloWorld but all we did was write this line and Eclipse provided that for us so notice that this is public class HelloWorld and this HelloWorld is spelled the exact same as the file name and if we have this with the wrong capitalization or spelling our program is not going to work so we have to have this the exact same notice that it has this red underline just like if you were writing on a document and you spell something wrong eclipse will underline it in red and tell you that it's not right now we're right and we can start writing so I'm gonna write a line and you guys are just gonna copy it exactly so I'm going to do public static void vo ID and then main then we're going to do a parenthesis and then string with a capital S to square our brackets and then args a RG s so this is what is called the main method we're not gonna go into exactly what the main method is but just know that all of your code is going to be inside of here and you have to write this line exactly how it is here or else your programs not gonna work so now you're gonna do a curly bracket press ENTER and another one should appear here so you see how there is an opening curly bracket here and then there's a closing one here all of our code has to be inside of these two curly brackets or else it's not inside the main method so if we write our code over here our code is going to be inside of the class as you can see here with this curly bracket but it's not going to be inside of the main method which is where we want to write it so we're not going to write it there we're gonna go inside of these curly brackets here and then we're gonna start writing so now I'm going to write another line and you guys have just have to copy this one exactly the same again so we're gonna do another capital S it's for system dot out dot print L N and then we're gonna have parentheses again we're gonna have quotes which you can find by holding shift and then the apostrophe on your keyboard and then we're going to type hello world just like the title of our program so notice that there's like a little underline here right underlined that's our that's Eclipse telling us that we're wrong and that this won't work if we try to run it so we have to have this semicolon at the end and then everything will be right and the red underline will go away so this is all the code we're going to need for our first program and now we're gonna run it so there are two ways to run our program so the first way is by pressing this green play button and this is run hello world the second way is by rightclicking going to run as here the same green play button and then java application now we're gonna have our hello world pop up in what's called the console window so this console here is just where the results of our program are going to show up and here what we wanted is we wanted to print hello world and then that's what our program did it printed hello world here so congratulations if you have hello world showing up here that means that your first program is successful and now we're going to go back to our slides and we're going to go into a little more in depth with our printing for our future projects so print statements that's what we just did in hello world we printed out hello world to our screen and now we are going to look at how we had these quotes notice that there is one left quote one right Club quote and all of our text is inside of it so if we look over here these print statements will not work this one doesn't have any quotes at all this one only has a left one and this one only has a right one and we're gonna take a look at these inside of Eclipse and I have another file here called printing examples where we can show this off so here we have examples of incorrect printing this is the one without any quotes only left quote and only right quote notice how Eclipse is telling us hey this line is wrong if you try to run it it's not gonna work so it has this red underline here and that means we have to fix it so for now I'm gonna delete this wrong code because we have the correct one and what it should look like up here 1cor on the left one on the right and notice that I have these extra words in a different color that's just what are called comments so comments are just what the programmer can use to remind it's remind him or herself what the code does and it tells other people reading your code exactly what it does so before I had those examples of incorrect printing and over here I have examples of incorrect printing telling you what they do so we're gonna have to have comments for every project that we do in the future but don't worry about exactly when to do comments or what you exactly you should write we're gonna get into that later so let's go back to our slides and we're gonna keep talking about printing and now we're gonna talk about println and just print so over here we have print Ln which is what we were using before but I want to tell you guys that it will print every word that's inside of these parentheses but it's also going to print another extra line after what you have inside of these parentheses so you can think of print Ln Ln as line and it's just another line after what you write another note is that system dot println without any words inside of it will mean that it's just gonna print a blank line with nothing in it just like if you were hitting answer on your keyboard when you're typing in like a document but we're gonna see that system dot out dot print no Ln means that there's not going to be an extra line so no Ln means no extra line so let's take a look at this inside of Eclipse so over here I have the print versus print Ln you can see from my comment and you can see that it says hello world prints with no Ln and then hello again with the Ln so let's see exactly what these two lines do when we try to run our program and remember that's how we run our program we're gonna click this green Run button or we can right click run as java application so first we just printed just exactly what we had in our original hello world but over here we can see that we did not have an Ln over here so there's no extra line over here it's like if you didn't press ENTER in a document it's all connected on the same line here so now when we do hello again it does have the Ln so it's going to have a line after it here and if we print something else it's going to show up on the next line so remember the difference between print and print Ln print no extra line print Ln there is an extra line after so we're going to go back to our slides and we're going to go over one more new thing so we can also combine words inside of a print statement with a plus sign just like if you were doing a plus sign in math it means you're going to put those two things together so in side of a print statement inside of these parentheses it's going to put hello and world together but notice that I have quotes surrounding each word and no quotes around the plus sign so let's take a look at this inside of Eclipse so we're done with these and over here it says combining words inside of a string so we see that here this plus sign there's no quotes around it but for every word that the plus sign is adding we needed quotes around both of them so hello world each with quotes and if I want to put more words like hello world this is my program these extra words are gonna stay in the same quotes so the quotes are just telling the computer that hey this is these are the words that I want to print I don't want to print this plus sign I just wanted to add the words for me so there's no quotes around here so now I'm gonna run this and it's gonna come to our console window and see here it added the hello world the hello and the world this is my program to make hello world this is my program so that's the end of the new stuff we're learning today but now we're gonna have a few questions for summary time these questions I'm not gonna answer today I'm gonna answer them in the next video that we have so for now you can just think about it and then when you watch the next video you can see if you're correct so the question one is how do we write the main method and I want the exact line of code with all the correct spelling and the capitalization all the correct symbols because if you don't do it exactly it's the computer is not gonna work it's not gonna a close it's not gonna let you run it and now question 2 how would you print the words to your console hello how are you so think about the the new print method we did what would it look like what would the exact line of code look like for you to print this to your console and the third question is what is the difference between print and print LM so if you don't remember the answer to any of these questions you should feel free to go back watch it again all of the answers are in the video and thanks for watching I'll see you guys in the next video where we're gonna go over these answers and then learn more about Java bye
