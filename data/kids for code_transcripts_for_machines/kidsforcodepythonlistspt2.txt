all right hello everybody welcome to kids for code uh today we're going to go over lists part two all right so combining lists if you want to combine several lists into one you can just add them with the plus sign so here we have two lists top of sandwich which has bread and cheese and bottom of sandwich which has lettuce ham and bread so if we printed out the top of the sandwich plus the bottom of the sandwich we're going to combine them with a plus sign so you get combined into one lift which is bread cheese lettuce ham and bread you take this and add this to one list all right now finding things in this if you want to find where something is in the list you can use index so for example here's my statement from before but fully made now i bread cheese lettuce and bread again so if we print out the index of cheese let's see how much the index cheese is gonna find the index that cheese is at which is zero one so should print out one now this finds the first index so if i had instead said bread it would have told me it was at zero it would not have talked about this one because that bread is not the first bread if you only want to know whether something is in a list you can use in my sandwich again but the in keyword uh turns into a boolean which is either true or false so each of these is either true or false so to start print olives and sandwich so are there olives in my sandwich red cheese lettuce ham bread none of those are always so this is false my next one ham and sandwich red cheese lettuce ham ah ham ham is ham obviously so him is in my sandwich so this one is false and this one is true so we get false true all right finding big and small things if you want to find the biggest thing in a list you can use max okay here prices equals 50 20 15 70 50. print max of prices what's the biggest price 70 right it's bigger than 50 20 15 and 50. so we're going to print out 70 because it's the biggest it's important to notice here that it prints out the thing that's biggest not where the biggest thing is for example it could have printed out instead zero one two three to say the third index so it doesn't say that it says what the biggest thing is if you want to find the smallest thing you can use min this works a lot like math in reverse in this case the smallest is 15. so it prints out 15. again you have to notice that it doesn't print out two because if you said index two it prints out fifteen because fifteen is a fig that's smallest all right changing the length of lists if you wanna add something to the end of the lift you can use a pen so here's most of my sandwich it has bread peanut butter and jelly we're going to add bread by appending it to the end so when i print out most of sandwich you get bread peanut butter jelly and bread if you want to delete something from a list you can use remove so here's a sandwich some extra stuff you have bread cheese watermelon and bread i personally don't like watermelon very much and i think most people don't like it in their sandwiches so we're going to take out watermelon and print extra sandwich you might guess i'm just going to take out the watermelon we have bread cheese and bread so here like before it's important to realize we'd say the thing we want to remove not where it is instead of saying watermelon's at 0 1 2 and saying index two we see watermelon because that's the thing we want to get rid of all right thank you guys for paying attention bye
