hey guys welcome to CSS styling part 2 for kids for Cody I'm Danny I'm gonna be demoing everything today so CSS we all learned about things like background colors and font size and how to change the color now we're just gonna win some more CSS rules properties so the first one is text alignment so here right here if you guys I know how to do this you've got left center right and justified so we're gonna learn how to do that in a HTML or a CSS so right here I have my P tag okay and that looks like this okay my webpage here my code here at my web page here so if I want my soccer so cool text to be in the middle I can type text a line and then I put Center okay and if I want it to be you know on the right because right is cool I can do that and of course the default is left justified isn't gonna do anything here because you don't have much text so I'm gonna grab some text real good if some generator where I'm if some is what really cool programmers use when they don't have text and they just want to put a design and they use it as placeholder text so right here is justify okay so what actually happens here is that all the words are spaced out so that it takes up the whole way okay we can see that it's different as left because see how the words aren't aligned straight here yeah so that's a difference justify means it's gonna take up the whole way and newspapers use these articles sometimes do and you can still do right another thing you can also do right justify oh wait make it my mistake yeah but um no I just forgot about that okay and next property we're going to learn without is text decoration so text decoration is one of the properties where you can put um just some or all of them so I can do text decoration and I can put underline and this text becomes underlying I can put over line and there's an over line and I can footwide there and there but the cool thing is I can do any combination of them too so I can do over line and underline and I just do a space between them now it's got an overlying hand and I'm going I have no idea when you would never need to use that down but it's really cool I do oh you definitely might need to give you some underline and a line through though that did not work just fine on his face but yeah you can do right here and it has an underline and a line too so you know I hope you get that remember that tag name here affects this tag and it will affect all other ptex okay so I think we're gonna learn about background color which we did learn in the last lesson let me go over it again so I can change the background color you know any element but things like images won't work too well because usually they take up the whole space so there's no room for a background but text is good so let's say I want red there's gonna be that or just red I can it will now have a red background and I can do aquamarine because that's also a very nice color sorry about the beeping that's the the printer um next we have padding so padding and margin they're both a little bit hard to understand but not too hard so the first thing I want and it's always good to demonstrate these with a background color or border because sometimes they act similar and you can't really tell the difference so I I'm just gonna show you something and I hope it's clear if I put padding and I do it's 12 pixels height12px 4 pixels it will make the text the content which is a text go in 12 pixels so right here I don't think there's any padding so it'll push the text up to 12 pixels here and 12 pixels here and yeah that's how it looks like so here's the padding this is 12 pixels from the top of the blue to the text and then from the side of the blue to the text that is 12 pixels okay well here might not be but here death um I'm gonna do a text align just a 5 so it takes a full width for clarity so here to hear from the end of the text the end of the blue is 12 pixels and I can make this a lot bigger if I wanted to so you know that kind of looks nice you know but I want to show you the difference from margin so I'm gonna show you none no cutting and then if I do me margin of 32 pixels yeah that's the difference so margin creates space around it but not including the background I'm not sure how much sense that makes but you can always just go back and forth to experiment but see how the background is on in this space well padding is with margin it just creates space around it outside of the background but with the padding they create space with the background okay it's kind of hard to understand but let's just try with both and eventually it'll just start making sense so this is what I've so excited about I've been so excited about so hover okay you put that after any element and it will change the element okay so and there's also things like active and focus which is um they have small technical variations but you really only need to know to be a good web developer CSS styling I guess so let's use something simple background color okay and let's do red so right here CSS understands that all these properties need to be applied to P tags right here and they are but with colon hover okay it mean it says whenever the mouse is over a P tag that specific P tag should have this property okay so it's almost look how it is like the CSS changes for that element when the mouse is over it okay colon hover meets the CSS that's applied to an element when the mouse is over it okay so right here if I save that now it turns red when I go over it and just another thing to be clear of if I do margin there's nothing like if you're right here is in within the margin you know 32 pixels 32 pixels here 32 pixels here that's all the margin okay but if on ant if you hover into it but colon heart does not get applied but if you use padding the colon hunger does get apply I hope that's clear yeah and I believe that's it I'm fine on programming your web sites guys um see you in class
