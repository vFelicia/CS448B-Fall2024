hi guys welcome back to kids for code day 3 my name is Zoe and I'm going to be your teacher for today so today we are going to be learning about how to create lists and links and HTML before we get started we are going to go over the answers to some to the summary questions that I left you off with in the previous video so question number one what is the tag that you must have at the very top of your code and that is going to be your document type so make sure that you have the exclamation part exclamation point right before the word doctype number two what is an empty tag mean an empty tag means that there is no closing tag and that there's only one of that tag this tag does not need to surround any other content so normally tags there's an opening and a closing tag however an empty tag means that there is only one of it and it does not need to surround any sort of content so in the last video we saw examples of this through the BR tag which creates a new line and the HR tag which creates a horizontal line number 3 what is the difference between an h1 and an H 6 tag h1 is the most important and h6 is the least important which means h1 creates a bigger heading than h6 so the text that you surround with h1 tags makes it bigger than text these surrounds with h6 tags and in the last example as you saw as we progress from h1 to h2 h3 h4 h5 and h6 the text is becomes smaller and smaller and so finally h6 is the smallest so if you ever wanted to create a big announcement then use an h1 tag number four what is a toggle you would use to create a line break and that would be the BR tag now notice with empty tags like this you put a forward slash right here before the closing bracket ok now we are going to learn how to create a skeleton now what is a skeleton a skeleton is all the code that you need whenever you create any sort of new HTML project so this is all the code that you need when you create any sort of HTML project now it's kind of annoying how you have to type all of this in every single time you have to start a new project so creating a skeleton is something that will make your lives a lot easier creating a skeleton just means you copy and paste all of this code or you type all this code into a new file and then you save that so that way whenever you start a new project then you can copy and paste this code into your new project so you don't have to manually type all of this code into your new project every single time so I'm going to demonstrate how you save that so in my brackets file right now I have my skeleton open now I'm not going to type any content into here this is just the code that I wanted to save for future projects so what I'm going to do is file save as I'm calling a skeleton dot HTML make sure you always put HTML at the end of your document and I'm saving it in my kids for code website now it's called skeleton because this code is the bare bones of every HTML project that you will create so it's important they give it someplace safe and you save it okay now we are going to learn how to create lists so first we have an ordered list an ordered list means that there are numbers and by default it starts at number one and ascends an increasing order so these oh L tags surrounds the entire list and inside the Oh L tags you have list items so these are the things that are on your list each list item has to be surrounded with this tag so here we have an example items to buy for college and notice up title of this was created with an h1 tag next we have our opening oh el tag and our closing Oh el tag and now inside we have each of our list items laptop minifridge laundry basket and notice how each item has its own set of Li tags next we have an unordered list an unordered list means that there are no numbers the order of the list items doesn't matter and use bullet points so here we have an example of ice cream flavors the title has been created with an h1 tag now we have our opening UL tag and our closing UL tag and now inside we have each of our list items chocolate vanilla and strawberry and the tags that you use for list items doesn't change regardless of whether you're using an unordered list or an ordered list so each of our list items is surrounded with an opening and closing Li tag and the order that you type in type it in in the code is the same order that it will appear in your browser and by default the bullet points are going to be small small black circles called disks so the cool thing you can do with ordered lists with all types of Lists actually is nesting and nesting is when you put one list inside of another list so here we're back with our ice cream flavors we have our unordered list chocolate vanilla strawberry however inside our chocolate list item we created a new list and in our new list we have dark milk dark milk so with nesting you can get a lot more specific with each of your list items we have more specific chocolate flavors right here so we have an unordered list right here nested inside this list item of chocolate now notice how the opening tag of chocolate is right here right before they type the word chocolate and the closing tag is right here after the closing tag of the unordered list that is nested inside now we have another example this time with an ordered list so here we have a todo list we have our opening closing tags and we have two items do laundry and walk the dog however inside do laundry we have a listed a nested list and we have more specific instructions on how to do the laundry so first carry the baskets basement to sort dark and light colors and three check settings on machine so we have this ordered list that gives more specific instructions on how to do the laundry now we are going to learn how to create links so first we're going to learn how to create links to other websites so this is the full tag on how you do it so this is how you do it first you create an opening bracket lowercase a space href equals open quote and this is where you paste the full URL of the website you would like to link close quote close this bracket and then here this word or you can have more than one word is where this link is going to be stored in so on the website the word Google is going to show up and if you click on the word Google it'll take you to this website google.com so in this way you can see that this link is stored inside whatever word is in here so I'm going to demonstrate by giving you another example so what I'm going to do is I'm starting a new HTML project right and as we said before I'm going to copy and paste all of the skeleton code copy new project and paste and always remember to save save as and I'm going to title this link example and don't forget dot HTML and we're going to save it in my documents kids for code folder save okay now I have the basic bare bones of what my project is going to look like now I want a website that I want to link so I'm going to go to the kids for code website and I'm going to copy their link now I'm going back to my code and notice that I'm going to be typing in between the two body tags that's where all of your content goes alright now let's type in the tag a space href equals now a nice thing that brackets does is that when you type in a quotation mark it automatically gives you a closing one so that you won't forget it alright now here is where I will paste my link alright that's the kids for code website link and make sure you close that and now here is where I need to give a few words or one word on that I wanted to store this link in so since this is the kids for code website I think I'm going to put kids for code all right now always remember to save or you can do ctrl s ok now let's live preview and see what this looks like all right here we have kids for code I click on it and it takes me to the kids for code website now let's say I just delete this text and don't forget to save let's go back see now there's nothing here on my web page so even though that the link appears here in your code if there is no word right here to store the Lincoln then the link is not going to appear anywhere on your web page so although you can literally type any word let's say I type in the word unicorn save that see we have the word unicorn and I click on it and it takes me to the same website however unicorn doesn't really have anything to do with kids for code if you want to put anywhere here you want to make it a word that is relevant to the website that you're linking so I think kids for code is the best few words to describe what this link is so let's save that and let's go back click on it and it takes us to kids for code so that is how you create a link to another website now let's go to lick let's learn about how to create links to pages that you have already created so here we have three different files index about and dogs and this is the code for each of them and this is what index will look like in the web browser now something important about this is that if you want to create links like this all of these files have to be saved in the same folder so in this case about dogs index are saved in the same folder called dogs so I'm going to demonstrate let's go to my folder and here's my dog's folder and here are my three files so let's open them in brackets click on it right click open with brackets click on the file right click open with brackets ok so I'm going to live preview what each of these websites look like so this is the about me page let's see what that looks like you all right so about me it's right here and these are the two links to the other two pages this is just some filler text it doesn't really mean anything okay now let's live preview what dogs look like looks like dogs same thing only difference is that dogs is here and we have about an index whenever you're creating a website with multiple pages index just means the home page okay finally let's go to our index home page it's the same thing except it says welcome so the syntax is pretty much the same thing as linking another website however inside the two quotation marks you don't put oh you've website URL you put the name of the file so here we are in the about page right yeah okay so we have two links here the first link and the second link and notice how they're also inside a list an unordered list so we have a first link in our second link and in the two in the quotation marks we have the file name so this is the file name for index this is the file name for dogs so if we go to the website and we click on it index we're on the index page and if we click on my dogs we're on the docs page so let's go to the dogs page we have our two links here this will take us this should take us to the about page and this link should take us to the index page let's see if it works about page yes index page yes so as you can see the syntax is pretty much the same except instead of a website URL here you put the exact file name make sure you spell it correctly because syntax is very important you all right now we are we have some summary questions so the answers to these summary questions can all be found throughout the video so if you rewind and watch carefully and listen carefully then you'll be able to answer all of these questions so number one what is the difference between Al and ul tags number two what is the tag used for a list item number three write the code for a link to your school's website and number four what is something you should keep in mind when creating links to other web pages you created that is going to be the end of this video thank you guys so much for watching and we'll see you next time bye you
