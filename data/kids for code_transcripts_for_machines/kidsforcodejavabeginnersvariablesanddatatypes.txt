hey guys welcome back to kids for code my name is Jason and today we'll be going over variables and data types for Java beginners so first a review of summary questions from day two so number one how you write the main method well there's only really one way to do this so there's the answer to how would you print the worst so your console hello how are you so we are using the print line instead of print but print also works just make sure the words that you're printing are surrounded by double quotes single quotes will not work okay and a difference between print and print line well print line basically jumps the next line after you print your words it's like pressing enter on your keyboard it it'll take your cursor down to the next line so whatever you print after so if you call print line and print some words out the next thing that you print will start on the next line whereas in print it does not start in the next line it will just start on the same line after after you after you print okay so the new stuff for today what is a variable a variable holds or stores of values so we use variables to label information to store information so in math for example we can have x equals 3 and x can only be 3 it can't be 3 & 4 it's just 3 so that's the same with job variables can only have one value and we can have different kinds of variables like with numbers and words and phrases so that's what datatypes are they are different kinds of variables we can create so we can go we can create integers doubles strings boolean's and now there are more data types than just those four but we're only going to be covering those four so integers integers are just simply whole numbers it can either be positive or negative so the following examples of work like 1 2 3 negative 8 0 also works but incorrect 1/2 because that's fraction negative 100.1 that's also that's decimal but the interesting one here is ten point zero now you may think well it's a whole number right but it's got the point zero on the end and integers can only store ten so if you want to store 10.0 you just write it as 10 so now doubles are how we store fractions and decimals so 1/2 would be correct the native three point five correct also you can store zero just like with ends but the thing the interesting thing here is one and eight of two because those are whole numbers so you may think they couldn't be stored doubles you may think you'd have to use an INT but the job java would just see one as 1.0 if you store it in a double so that's why it still works and now a string is a collection or string of letters that makes words or phrases so hello world is a string strings don't necessarily have to have multiple words they can just have one and that'll still work and now boolean's boolean's are simply just true or false they can only be true or false that's it okay so they actually create variables we're gonna actually go into eclipse here in just a sec but the format is datatype so that would be write int double string boolean and then a name so you can basically name it whatever you want however there are a couple of rules you have to follow and then equals the value so remember think of the value being placed inside of your variable your variable is like a label for your value so some naming rules camelcase we'll go over where that is in just a second cannot have spaces so you can't have variable space name you have to have in one one word you can't start with a number or special symbol you however can have these in your variable name they just cannot be able to start and it cannot be a Java keyword you'll know if it's Java keyword if it is highlighted in purple such as double Orient okay so now I'm gonna hop into eclipse so if I wanted to create a variable for H I would do int age equals 42 so here we got the we got the data type and then the name and then the value so now if I wanted to create a double double say price equals four point nine nine and so we got double right that is a type name and then the actual value which is a decimal which is what doubles store now here's an interesting example if I do double it's called fraction equals onefourth this will actually not store onefourth it'll store zero and I'm not going to get into that abused a bit too complicated for today but whenever you want to store fractions don't don't write it as a fraction just write the decimal form of the fraction so can set up 1/4 I would write 0.25 and now for a string so we can have string sentence right we can have you just say this is a sentence and now we can also have one word stream so string name equals Bob so that works and finally boolean's we have boolean is cold outside and we would say that's false right now okay so those that is how you declare variables that is how you create variables and oh yeah and camelcase so what I just did here is camel case when you have multiple words that you want to call your variable and you can't have spaces so what programmers do is they write in camel case that is where you make the first word lowercase and then the the rest of the words uppercase so that is that is really all camel cases just first word lowercase all the rest uppercase that's how you write in camel case okay so you up here are some examples that we just went over in Eclipse okay so now primitive versus non primitive so primitives include so far what we learned in double boolean again there are more primitives we're just not going to learn about them and they are basic building blocks for more complicated data types so for example a string is non primitive it is more complicated than int double and boolean which are all simple and that's why they're primitives so string is more complex and it is actually built off of primitives so that is why that is how we distinguish between primitives and non primitive it's that primitives are the building blocks for other more complicated data types okay and now we can get into printing variables so we can print any of these four types of data here with a simple print statement so in order to print the variable put the variable name in the print statement that's it no quotes no single close double quotes none of that just the variable name and this will print the value of the variable it's not going to print the word age if I wanted to print the word age I would I would put quotes around right that that would print age see the word age but I want to print the variable age so I am not gonna book quotes around it I am going to just put the word age the variable name age and it'll spit out 42 and that's what we want so you can do that with doubles as well strings boolean it'll either print true or false now one thing have to be careful of is this you have to make sure you initialize your variables so if I make another variable here and I set it equal to something by the way initialize means set it equal to something so if I try to print this it will actually give you an error because I didn't initialize it it'll say and then it'll give me an option so I have to initialize it by giving it a value viens just say okay and then so now that now that error is fine now it'll print out last name which has the value Smith okay so now let's do a summary so number one what is an example of an integer or in Java they're called insight we write int number two what is camelcase number three right the line of code to initialize a string variable so you can choose any words you nationalize it to remember strings can be one or many words and with that thank you for watching and I will see you in the next one bye
