hey guys welcome back to kids for code today we will be talking about variable manipulation and user input manipulating means changing our variables we will do this all the time in our programs here's an example we have the statement age equals 10 but what if today was our birthday what if we wanted to update our age to be one year older well we take that statement and add another age equals h plus one it takes the preexisting value of age which is ten and adds one to it making it eleven you can use other math operators other than addition such as subtraction multiplication division and modulus there are also shortcuts you can use you can use age plus equals one to do the same exact thing as age equals h plus one here are some basic math operators we have addition subtraction div multiplication and division for advanced math operators we have exponents floor division and modulus here is an example in python so we have a which equals five and b equals two so addition is a plus b subtraction equals a minus b multiplication equals a times b division equals a divided by b so addition equals seven subtraction equals three multiplication equals ten and division equals two point five exponent equals a to the power of b four division equals a divided by b but it's different than normal division modulus equals a modulus b so exponent would equal 25 or five to the second power fourteen would equal two you might think that this is rounded but it's slightly different if it was rounded then instead of two point five five divided by two would equal three but for division we just get rid of the decimal and for modulus the answer is one and this is because five divided by two equals two with the remainder of one that remainder is the answer to five modulus two so five minus two equals one and now i will show you a demo in pycharm okay so we're going to start by making an integer called num1 and we'll make it equal to 12. next we're going to make a float and we're going to call it num2 and we're going to make it equal to 2.5 so we're going to use a print statement for mathematical operators so i want to print num1 times num2 the value of that so what i do is i write num1 times num2 when i print it out to the console it will say 30.0 now 12 times 2.5 equals 30 but since you're multiplying an integer and a float the result will always be a float that is why it's 30.0 instead of 30. and note that you can multiply them within the print statement and when you do this the value of num2 and num1 are not changed but if we wanted to change the value of num1 we could do it like this so i could go num1 equals num1 plus 10. then i'm gonna print that out to the console to see to make sure that the value was changed correctly so i'm going to run it again and this time the second thing printed out is 22 and the reason why we get 22 is because num1 equal 12 but then this statement that comes afterward has no one equal num1 plus 10. so it takes the value of 12 and adds 10 to it making it 22. now i will show you some information about user input now i will talk about user input and string concatenation bruff briefly mentioned this subject in our print statement lesson but concatenation is a fancy word for combining two strings together we can do this by simply combining two strings with a plus sign so hi plus there it will just in a print statement it would print out hi there and if you wanna write the same string multiple times and you don't want to have to write it again and again and again you can just do hello times six however when you use the plus sign to combine values it only works for strings if you try and do this with integers or floats an error will occur this is because the compiler is trying to mathematically add a number and a word which you actually can't do because you can't add 6 and hello that doesn't make sense so if you want to print out a string variable with a boolean or an integer or a float in the same print statement you can use one of two methods you can use a comma instead of a plus sign which will automatically add a space between the two values so when it prints out i'm there'll be a space then 17 another space and then years old so it prints out i'm 17 years old and the spacing is correct or you could type class your inflow or boolean to a string you can place the nonstring value inside the parentheses of the statement str for short for string and here's an example of it so we got print i'm plus string 17 plus years old notice how there's spaces at the end of this at the end of i'm and at the and before years old this is because when you use pluses it doesn't automatically add a space so you have to space it out in your quotation marks and not through the variable now when we talk about the len function len function we use the len function to get the length of a string you can put the string inside len to get the string's length if you see in this example there is class name which equals python then we make another variable which is equal to the length of class name when we print this out and concatenate it to make sure that it is spaced out properly it will print out word length is 6. it returns an integer this is because the length of a word is an integer not a string or a boolean or a float and remember that since it's an integer we have to concatenate if we're going to be using it with a string user input you we can get input from the keyboard by typing into our program we will do this with the input method so if you see here there's a print statement that asks what is your favorite class and a variable that equals input so what happens is this print statement will show up on the console and then there will be cur a cursor will appear and then you can type it in then there's another print statement here and it prints out your favorite class is plus whatever the input was so if you typed in math like in this example we'll say your favorite class is math alternatively you can combine this print statement and the variable declaration name equals input in something where you go name equals input what is your favorite class and then you can print out your favorite classes plus name and then you will get the same result except for one tiny difference your user input is entered on a different line when you separate name equals input and the print statement but if you don't separate them then the input and the print statement will be on the same line i will now show you a demo in pycharm here's the demo for user input so i'm going to start by asking for the person's name and to do this i'm actually going to combine my declaration of the variable in my print state so i'm going to say name equals input and then i'm going to have my parentheses quotation marks what is your name always remember spacing because that affects where your input is put because if you don't have the space the variable will be right next to the question mark and there will be no spaces in between this is also important to um watch out for when you're um connect concatenating with strings so i have a statement name equals input what is your name then i'm going to make another one that asks for age and since it's an integer and not a string i actually have to do something different now this this difference applies if you're using a boolean integer or float so before i type in input i have to say int parentheses input to let the computer know that i'm taking input as an int and you do the same thing with float and booleans except instead of writing in you'd write float or bool depending on what you're using and then you continue like normally after adding in before then you just make more parentheses and then have your print statement inside and this time i'm going to ask what is your age now i'm going to have a statement that tells the user the information that the user gave to us so we're gonna combine stuff or concatenate a string and an integer the string is name and the integer is age start with your name is and i'm going to try something here and see if it works your name is plus and i'm going to add name plus and u r plus age plus quotation marks years old so what this is supposed to do is print out your name is plus your name plus you and you are your age years old so if my name was george and i was 10 years old it your name is george and you are 10 years old at least it should anyway but when i run it i'm going to enter my name calvin my age 14. what happens is an error because you cannot use a plus sign for integers without typecasting the integer to a string but to fix this i don't have to typecast the integer age to a string i can also use commas i'm going to show you that now but since these commas automatically add a space i don't have to worry about spacing anymore so i can delete these spaces in the print statement portion of the print statement so then i will delete these plus signs and i will run it so what happens is i enter my name i enter my age and i'll print out your name is calvin and you are 14 years old but let's say i want to use plus signs so for this one i'd have to use spaces inside of the quotation marks to make sure that my print statement is formatted properly so now i replace the comma with a plus sign and then i use str then i surround age in parentheses this instead of this prints out age as a string instead of as an integer allowing you to use plus signs so now i'm going to try it and i made sure that i spaced out the words in quotation marks now i will run it again type in my name and my age and it responds your name is calvin and you are 14 years old uh thank you for watching this video i hope you learned a lot about user input and variable manipulation i hope you have a great day goodbye
