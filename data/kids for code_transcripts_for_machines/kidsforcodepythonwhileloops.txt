hello everyone welcome to kids for code today we'll be learning about why loops all right so what are loops let's say i wanted to print out hello three times how do we do this the obvious answer is print printhello printhello printhello what if one to do that a hundred times we have to write the same thing over and over and over and over again loops let us execute the same code over and over until the condition is broken or false that way we don't print hello 100 times a while loop is a kind of loop that keeps on going while a condition is true it's kind of like a repeating if statement that starts over again if it's true instead of just running it for example while a bathtub is not full keep filling it with water so if bathtub is not full we add more water if bathtub is still not full we add more water if bathtub is still not full you add even more water and then when bathtub is full we don't add any more water this bathtub is not full is now false let's try the bathtub example so we'll say first how full or bathtub can get we'll say it's when the height of the water is five all right now let's see where our bathtub is right now the bathtub now is at zero there's no water in it all right so while the bathtub now is less than the full bathtub i'm going to add water by adding one to it and plus equals one all right so then we can print out at the end uh how much water we you have see it's five you can see how we got there also let's try this again right as you can see we start out first are zero then we add one so there's one we go to two because one was less than five they got a three because two was less than five you have four and five and try to win the while loop again that's of now is five and full bathtub is also 5. so since 5 is not less than 5 you stop doing the while loop so while the steps step 1 we check the condition just like the if statement if it is true and only if it is true in step two we run our code step three we go back to the condition and check if it's true and step four we repeat this until the condition is false all right let's look at an example we're going to count from one to ten so we're going to say our counter is one while the counter is less than or equal to ten print counter value counter counter plus equals one so you have to go to a valley where the condition will eventually be false otherwise you're going to go into an infinite loop and it just keeps on going over and over and over again it will never stop in this example the loop's condition depends on the counter variable this counter is written here we're increasing counter by one every iteration the counter will eventually be 11 this makes this condition false because 11 is not less than or equal to 10 and the loop will stop if we didn't have counter plus equals 1 the loop would never end and we have an internal loop we do not want this let's look at the counter example so remember the counter starts at one and while the counter is less than or equal to ten let's try running it let's see what happens the first counter value to get is one because we run this counter one is less than or equal to ten we print out the value and add one next value is two because one was less than ten sorry because 2 is less than 10. you rented out two and we added a one now it's three to print out three because three is less than ten four five six seven eight nine until we get all the way up to ten ten is still less than or equal to ten so we print out ten then we add one to the counter to make it eleven but now eleven is not less than or equal to ten so we end the while loop which brings us the end of the program let's make a simple game called the waiting game all right we're going to keep track number of rounds the player has played we'll start it at zero because we haven't played anything yet i'm also going to get input from the user i'm going to ask if they want to play another round and ask them as a yes or no question it's the other answer y or n if the answer yes meaning they want to keep on playing we're going to keep on looping through this i'm going to add a round and tell them how many rounds they played for let's test it out and see how it works you want to play another round we'll say yes i played for one round you want to play for another round of course i do i played for two rounds do you want to play another round sure i do you want to play another round i'm tired of waiting so i'll say no there it ended because this became false my input was not y when my input was y kept on going and running this code over and over and over again that's all while it was let's look at the summary questions one what do we use loops for and why do we use them question two why do we need to make sure to change the condition variable when looping you can answer these on your own for now we'll go over them next class
