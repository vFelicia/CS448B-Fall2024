hi guys welcome to kids four codes first video we're so happy that you guys are joining us and we hope you're as excited as we are to be doing something new and fun so my name is Connie and I'll be one of the teachers just before we get started a little information about kids for codes so we are high school students who love to code and want to teach kids like you who are eager to learn just how fun coding is and anyone can join us it's especially made for kids but you have to be able to use the computer at a basic and beginner level meaning you can navigate through files you use a web browser like Chrome or Microsoft edge something on that and be able to type for today's video you don't need to download or install anything but in the future if we do you will be sure to help you navigate through everything stepbystep so no worries there is also no age limit or anything anyone and everyone is welcome to join us and learn coding with us so what we do we upload these YouTube videos on coding languages and computer science topics for you guys to learn from and watch from home and we also host free zoom lessons where you can come in ask questions get any extra help that you need and this is also a place where we can give out extra practice if you want and walk you through projects that we assign it's a really great resource for now we're going to be focusing on three main coding languages HTML and CSS which are tied together Python and Java before we go any further I just wanted to show you guys our website for kids for code so this is just a place you can come to get more information about us to get a more detailed description about our services what we do what we offer things like that and you can contact us through our website if you have any questions or if you have any suggestions for us we're always open to suggestions and improvement so feel free to do that and this is also where you can come to sign up for our free zoom lesson it's a really great resource that's where you go I wanted to show you guys our curriculum since we're just getting started there's only one folder up so far but you can click on this and this is where you can see all the topics and the cool things we're going to be learning about these next few days so feel free to check it out okay so you might be wondering why is knowing how to code so important what's the big deal well you can make almost anything you want anything you dream up with coding I'm going to build a website I'm coding wanna go to space also coding you want to build a robot also coding obviously these are very big expensive projects that you probably don't do very often but so many other things in your daily lives too extremely useful and important skill to have HTML and CSS which are the two languages we're going to be starting with today are one of the most commonly used coding languages and it's actually use like people all over the world to make your own websites by the end of our HTML lessons you guys will be able to do just that make your own website so besides all useful coding is in the real world and how fun it is there are so many other benefits like being able to use and understand your daily technology better like your phones your laptop's your video games things like that it also improves your thinking skills and your problemsolving skills and so much more in just in general computers and Technology are huge part of our world in our lives and our future or whether people like it or not so we strongly believe that everyone should be able to have these basic coding skills including kids because it's never too early to start learning so you heard me talk about these coding languages before but you might not know what they are well just like you use languages like English Spanish Chinese French and more to talk to your friends your family and your teachers everyday and communicate with them you need these coding languages to talk to your computer obviously the computer can't understand English for other children languages so you need these complete coding languages like HTML Python Java and more to communicate with your computer just like you communicate with other people so let's go into a little more detail about a few specific coding languages HTML and CSS so what exactly is a Gmail and CSS well as we mentioned before hTML is used to keep websites on the Internet ESS is just another language that we use to help our HTML websites with much cooler and more interesting so think of HTML as the basic building blocks of your page for the basic plain foundation of a house pretty boring nothing much to see but with CSS we can design and transform this boring house or website into something much more unique and interesting to look at basically we need both CSS and HTML because they go handinhand to help us make really cool websites so to get started there are three main cards we want to begin with this big text in bold is called a header this is a paragraph and this is a type of list it's a bulleted list what you guys call when you aren't familiar with this is a really simple clean website that I created in literally 30 seconds and this is a code that I used to clean it with but don't get over one when you see this at first I know it can look like a lot trust me it's actually very simple and we're gonna go into a lot more detail about this later don't worry but for now just take note of this text in green these are called HTML tags notice how they don't appear in your final web site that's because these tags they telling the computer what to do and they tell it give them instructions on how to display your content in your final website but they don't actually show up and your final product so in order to create your own website you're going to need tools this is where you put all your own your code in for today it's very simple all you need is a text editor it's already installed on your computer so you don't need to download anything if you're using a PC just go to your search bar and type notepad and quick notepad if you're using a Mac let's go to your applications and click TextEdit so my website that I showed you guys earlier is saved as an HTML file because HTML I'm sorry and this is just the structure that it gets saved to your computer so you've got the name on your file and the file extension this file extension just tells the browser what type of file it is in this case it's an HTML file and you don't really need to know all the details about this just know that's how the file gets saved to your computer but just writing the code in a file or a text editor isn't enough because how do you actually see your website well to do this you're going to need a browser I'm going to show you guys what I did after I wrote all my code in notepad I went ahead and saved it to my computer and then I went and found the file location on my computer where it was saved on my computer and click open win you can choose any web browser you want I chose Chrome and you've got your website how cool is that really simple and easy and obviously that's a very simple example kind of boring but in about a week you guys are going to be able to make much better and complex websites with up there getting started with tags and elements we're not going to go into too much detail about this today today is more of a basic introduction to get you guys familiar with HTML and what it is that all you need to know for now is that HTML uses these things called tags which are these angled brackets you can find these on your keyboard over here so as I mentioned before these tags act as directions for the computer they tell the computer how to display your content in your final website they don't actually show up themselves and the weapon that product so for example this HR tag this tells the browser to display a horizontal line and the words or letters inside between these angled brackets these tags are called elements and most of the tags that we're going to be working with come in pairs this means they have an opening tag and a closing tag the only difference between a closing tag an opening tag is that the closing has a slash in front of it but everything else is the exact same the element or the words and letters inside of these times are the exact same this just tells the computer that they're parrots they're part of the same pair another important thing to know for today is that while hTML is mostly Jason Stiles insensitive which means you can use uppercase lowercase or any combination of uppercase or lowercase that you want and it wouldn't really accept your website it's best to keep it consistent and use moose we use everything in lowercase which is what we're going to be doing so summary time this is just the part of the video where we rocket will we learn today and do a little bit of review and just a reminder I wanted to remind you guys that you can go to our website to sign up for our free zoom lessons to get extra pockets extra help and get more information about us so we come up with these three these four main coding my sorry three main questions for today's video what are coding languages what are HTML and CSS what is HTML News 4 and what is CSS used for and what do tags do so take the time to think about the answers to these before the next video and next time we'll start off by reviewing today's talk bags and these questions and if you're having trouble with these questions feel free to rewind and rewatch this video because all the answers are in this video and in the next video we're going to go into actual indepth coding so that's not something you want to miss be sure to stay tuned ok thank you guys so much for watching and we hope to see you next time
