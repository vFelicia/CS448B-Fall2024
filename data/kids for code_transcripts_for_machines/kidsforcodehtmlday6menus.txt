hi guys welcome back to our final html lesson so today we're going to be learning about making menus or navigation bars for our website we're going to start off with the basics which is just html and just like in a restaurant uh for a restaurant menu our navigation bar on our website is basically just going to be a list of items more specifically the items are going to be links to other pages that we create so the user can navigate to different pages and so to start off our html we're going to be making an unordered list of links so i'm going to demo we're going to create an unordered list and inside for our list items we're going to be putting links and you guys have done this already so this should be a piece of cake and i'm just going to put three websites that i have already made and the last one okay so i have my three links or list items in my unordered list and if i were to live preview this we can see that we just have a simple unordered list with bullets and some formatting to let us know that these are links now for our navigation bar we don't want bullets and we don't want the formatting so next we're going to use css to get rid of some of these formatting so for the css we're going to start learning how to create a vertical navigation bar and as you can see like we have demoed the list is bulleted and formatted and in order to get rid of these we need to use css so the three properties that we're going to be using are list style type margin and padding and our selector is going to be ul or our unordered list because that is where most of the formatting takes place so inside our style tags we're going to use the selector ul and the list style type property is going to be used to get rid of the bullets in the browser for links there is some default formatting which kind of pulls the list away from the side of the page and closer to the center so for our navigation bar we want it to be exactly on the side of our page so we're going to get rid of that by setting the margin and the padding to zero now we can see that the bullets are gone and the list is exactly on the side of our page which is where we want it so next you can see that for links there's some text decoration which is the underline and you guys have learned the text decoration property in order to get rid of these underlines we're going to be setting the text decoration property to none so our selector for this is going to be list item link because uh we have a list of links and we want to specify that it is the list or the links in our list that we want to format and not the other links on our page so we're going to set text decoration to none and now we can see that the underlines are gone and next we're going to be talking about something called display or block display as you can see if i hover my mouse over the words i'm able to click on the link but if i were to move my mouse outside of the words in this blank space right here i can't click it and navigate to a different page and for our navigation bars we want it to be we want it to be easy to use so that the user can click a large area around the word and still be able to navigate to a different page so for this we're going to use a property called display and we're going to set it to block and in order for you guys to visualize visualize this i'm going to set the background color to let's say this color now if i were to run it you can see that the space outside of the words is also in color and if i were to click outside of the words in this space it actually takes me to the page which means the link is active all along this colored area and if i were to set my screen to the biggest you can see that it extends all the way across the page now for our navigation menus we don't need it to be all the way across the page so we're going to set the width to a width that we would like and i'm just going to set my width to about 100 pixels and you can make yours whatever you would like so if we were to run this you can see that the length has decreased significantly and it's just this area that is clickable so i can click outside of the words and the links still work um so that is about it for making a vertical navigation bar and we also have horizontal navigation bars which is similar to the navigation bar you see up here on the screen where my mouse is so to create a horizontal navigation bar first we're going to be talking about the display property again and keep in mind that using the display property to create a horizontal navigation bar only works if you have not formatted your menu yet and what i mean by that is this is a formatted navigation bar and if i were to use the display property and set the value to inline this will have no effect on what the menu looks like so as you can see if i were to use the selector list item and set the display to inline our menu remains vertical now if i were to get rid of this formatting that i have here we can see that the links have moved side by side and now this is basically a horizontal navigation bar but if you wanted to keep your formatting and keep your um block display you can use a different property which is called float and we're going to set this float property to left which will get our block elements to be next to each other so if i i have replaced my formatting and now i'm just going to replace the display in line line to float and set it to left and now if i were to run it we can see that our links are formatted and uh in a horizontal line next to each other now you can also set float to right and what this will do is just going to move all the links to the right side of your page if you wanted your navigation bar to be on the right side instead of the left so that is it for navigation bars and i hope you guys get a lot of practice doing this it's really fun once you get used to it and since this is our last lesson um we'll be saying goodbye and i hope you guys keep coding and i hope you guys have had a fun time with us learning about html bye
