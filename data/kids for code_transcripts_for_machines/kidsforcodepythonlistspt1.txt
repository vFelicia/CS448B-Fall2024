hey guys welcome back to kids for code today we're going to be learning about lists so what do we know so far we know how to declare variables one at a time and we know that only one piece of data can be stored in that variable however what if we wanted to store related pieces of data into one variable what would what would we store it in a box or a container well we have this thing called lists and what is a list well lists or are ordered sequences that can hold a variety of data types so we use square brackets to hold the data which is kind of like the container and then we use commas to separate each piece of data that is inside the container so items and lists are indexed the same as characters and strings the first item starts with index 0 and each index holds a certain piece of data so here we have a visual example of a list so as you can see we have four items in this list and each one is index so the first element which is which contains strawberry is index zero and then the next one is banana which is index 1 and so on so let's look at this example in our code so let's take the same fruits example and we're going to um declare a list variable called fruits and then we're going to set it equal to a list so to declare the list we're going to start with a opening square bracket and then put each of our list items in in this case it's strings which is like the string strawberry and then each list item is separated by commas right here so each item is assigned an index it's just like the characters um in strings that we just learned so look at this in python so um if i declared a variable called fruits and set it to a list so i'm going to start with an opening bracket and then store a list of four strings so string strawberry then a comma next one banana mango and apple that is how you declare a list so now we're going to go into printing lists so to print the list the entire list we can just print the variable just like we normally would so print fruit okay so let's run that and here we get the list printed out with the square brackets and the commas so that's how we print out the list but what if we wanted to print out a specific element of the list like for example banana so how we do this is by accessing elements and it is exactly the same as how we deal with strings so we write the list variable followed by square brackets and the indices we want to include so if we wanted to print out banana for example this is index 0 1 2 3. so banana is index 1 in the fruits list variable so do that we're just going to do it just like we did with strings last time we're going to write the fruits variable and then a square bracket and then the index which is 1. if we run that we get banana and we can do the same thing as if we want like from the first index to the third index um from some middle index to the end or from the start to some um index in the middle for example i could do like uh one two three so that would print out um the first index which is banana all the way up to three but not including three so um one zero one two three so it would just include one and two so it should just print out banana and mango and yep that's what we have and remember that we can also use negative in this index indices um and that would like negative one gives you the very last item in the list so fruits negative one should give me apple yep there we have it so to modify uh your list we're going to access the element you want to change using the square bracket just like we did right before and then we're going to use the assignment operator to change it to something else so let's say i didn't like strawberries anymore and i wanted to change it to pineapple so strawberry is index zero so we're going to access that element first so fruits zero and then assign it to something else so remember to reassign we use the equals assignment operator and we change it to whatever we want so pineapple if we run that let's print that okay so now we don't see strawberry anymore because we replaced it with pineapple some important things about lists is that unlike some other languages you can store different data types in a list and it works exactly the same as all the other lists we just did so for example i can declare a list variable called items and i can have it store strings booleans doubles or float sorry um and that's what we have here and it works just like everything else we've done and then to get the length of the list we use the len function um which is the same as strings so i wanted to get the length of the fruits list variable you can declare a variable called length and use the len um function so when fruits then we can print the length and we should get four now um okay so we can also loop through lists so we can use the for loop which is what we just learned last week um and this is like the easiest way to loop through a list because a list is iterable so let's say i wanted to use a for loop to print out uh every element of a list so write a for loop remember that the list is iterable so we can just declare like fruit or it can be item or anything and then in fruits so this loops through each element of the item which is separated by commas so then we can just print item and run it and we should get each element on a new line um so you actually cannot reassign the list element to something else using this um variable you have here so think of um like fruit here or item here as kind of like a temporary copy of the element that you're on right now so remember that to reassign a list element we have to actually reference the item in the list you can't use a copy because then you would just be changing the copy not the actual element in the list so to reassign the list element remember we have to um get the element and then reassign something else so let's see let's try to reassign it and see um what happens so once i wanted to replace every single element with pineapple so if i tried it like this i'm hoping that each element will the pineapple but let's see what happens nothing changes and it's because item is just a copy so the actual elements of the fruits list is not changed so if we did want to reassign items using a for loop it's a little bit complicated so we're going to use the range function so in range and then the length of the list so this is um going through 0 1 2 3 because the length is 4 and remember that the range of 4 is 0 1 2 and 3. so this way we can just use i as the index so fruits i and we can reassign it so basically this is just going zero and then fruits of zero we assign it to pineapple then one fruit of one we assign that to pineapple so now we see that the actual fruits list was changed an easier way to do this is actually using a while loop so let's first start with trying to print out each element in a list using a while loop so first we're going to set a variable called index to zero and then while index is less than the length of our list so remember that the length is four but our list only goes up to index three um so this is why it's less than not less than or equal to so we're going to go 0 1 2 3 and then envelope so if we wanted to print each element we're going to write a print statement and then fruits index and then remember that you have to change this index variable or else we're going to go into an infinite loop so let's run that and we've printed out each element so first our index is zero it prints the zeroth index of fruit and then we add one so index is now one one is still less than four which is the length of our fruits list we're going to print out the first index of fruits which is banana and we're going to keep doing that until index is 3 3 is still less than 4 print out apple and then when index is 4 4 is not less than 4 so it ends the loop and then to reassign list item list items we can do almost the same thing as what we did with the for loop so fruits that that index of fruits will reassign to pineapple and then we're going to add one to index if we run that we print it you should get pineapple pineapple pineapple pineapple so first we start with zero and then the zeroth index of fruits we're going to assign it to pineapple and then one two three and do the same thing so that's it for today and i'll see you guys next time
