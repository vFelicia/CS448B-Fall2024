00:00 - hi guys welcome back to our youtube
00:02 - channel
00:03 - um this video is basically a brief
00:05 - introduction
00:06 - slash recap of different languages
00:10 - and um the differences between these
00:12 - languages
00:13 - um it's just to give you a brief
00:14 - understanding before we move ahead with
00:16 - all
00:16 - our different coding series so let's get
00:19 - started
00:22 - okay um so just an introduction to
00:25 - languages and their differences
00:27 - um so there are about 700 programming
00:32 - languages
00:32 - including esoteric coding language
00:36 - um that's not a very important term
00:38 - right now oops so we won't define it
00:41 - um other sources that only list notable
00:44 - languages still
00:45 - count up to impressive 245 languages so
00:49 - those are languages that are
00:50 - used on a daily basis of all around the
00:53 - world
00:54 - computer programming languages um are
00:56 - used to communicate
00:58 - um instructions to a computer they are
01:02 - based on certain
01:03 - syntactic and semantic rules which
01:05 - define the meaning of each of the
01:07 - program language constructs
01:09 - uh here this is basically a list of the
01:12 - top
01:13 - 20 of the many languages that are
01:15 - available
01:16 - um the list is
01:19 - not the top 20 in order but it's just
01:22 - the top 20 in general
01:25 - um now coming to the most used language
01:27 - across the world
01:28 - i think the most used language across
01:30 - the world would be python
01:31 - evidently 31.2 um
01:35 - so the benefits of um python is
01:39 - python is widely regarded as a
01:40 - programming language that's easy to
01:42 - learn due to its
01:43 - simple syntax a large library of
01:46 - standards and toolkits
01:48 - and integration with other popular
01:50 - programming languages
01:51 - such as c and c plus plus in fact it is
01:54 - the first language the students learn in
01:56 - a lying program
01:58 - design program um it is a very popular
02:02 - programming language especially among
02:04 - startups and therefore python skills are
02:06 - high demand um
02:09 - so python is commonly used in um in
02:13 - um in a wide variety of applications
02:16 - including artificial intelligence
02:18 - financial services
02:20 - and data science uh social media sites
02:22 - such as instagram and pinterest are also
02:24 - built on python which is
02:25 - um it just shows how much python is used
02:28 - across the world
02:29 - um we've also done a series on basic
02:32 - python coding on our
02:34 - channel so please go watch it to
02:37 - understand and learn more about python
02:40 - um now up till now what we've covered on
02:44 - this
02:44 - on our youtube channel so if you look at
02:46 - our youtube page this is a screenshot of
02:49 - our youtube page
02:50 - uh you'll see that um we have covered
02:54 - python um scratch and
02:57 - we as coding languages and we also have
03:01 - a
03:01 - series of um women in stem which
03:04 - basically
03:05 - takes you through all the successful
03:07 - women um
03:09 - in stem field and how they grew and what
03:12 - they have accomplished
03:13 - so far um now
03:16 - um so now that um you know what
03:20 - languages are i'm just gonna introduce
03:22 - and tell you what our next
03:24 - series is going to be about so our next
03:26 - series is
03:28 - basically um using a mobile coding app
03:32 - to code and um
03:35 - the mobile coding app that we're going
03:36 - to be using is decoder
03:38 - very simple amazing love it easily
03:42 - uh you can use it very easily um
03:46 - it's a very basic and a very um nice and
03:48 - simplistic
03:50 - um app for mobile coding and you can't
03:53 - use it for
03:54 - big things but for a basic level for
03:56 - just understanding and learning purposes
03:58 - this is possibly one of the best apps
04:00 - that you could use
04:01 - um very easy to download you can
04:04 - download it on all
04:05 - ios or android devices um and it's
04:09 - completely free
04:10 - so the two main languages that we will
04:12 - be covering in our upcoming mobile
04:14 - coding series is html and css
04:17 - and to get a more understanding of what
04:19 - these two languages are and they're used
04:21 - on a daily basis
04:22 - please have a look at our next youtube
04:24 - video um
04:27 - that's it for now thank you so much for
04:29 - watching
04:30 - again please follow us on all our social
04:32 - media sites and subscribe to our youtube
04:34 - channel for more
04:35 - amazing content thank you bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys welcome back to our youtube channel um this video is basically a brief introduction slash recap of different languages and um the differences between these languages um it's just to give you a brief understanding before we move ahead with all our different coding series so let's get started okay um so just an introduction to languages and their differences um so there are about 700 programming languages including esoteric coding language um that's not a very important term right now oops so we won't define it um other sources that only list notable languages still count up to impressive 245 languages so those are languages that are used on a daily basis of all around the world computer programming languages um are used to communicate um instructions to a computer they are based on certain syntactic and semantic rules which define the meaning of each of the program language constructs uh here this is basically a list of the top 20 of the many languages that are available um the list is not the top 20 in order but it's just the top 20 in general um now coming to the most used language across the world i think the most used language across the world would be python evidently 31.2 um so the benefits of um python is python is widely regarded as a programming language that's easy to learn due to its simple syntax a large library of standards and toolkits and integration with other popular programming languages such as c and c plus plus in fact it is the first language the students learn in a lying program design program um it is a very popular programming language especially among startups and therefore python skills are high demand um so python is commonly used in um in um in a wide variety of applications including artificial intelligence financial services and data science uh social media sites such as instagram and pinterest are also built on python which is um it just shows how much python is used across the world um we've also done a series on basic python coding on our channel so please go watch it to understand and learn more about python um now up till now what we've covered on this on our youtube channel so if you look at our youtube page this is a screenshot of our youtube page uh you'll see that um we have covered python um scratch and we as coding languages and we also have a series of um women in stem which basically takes you through all the successful women um in stem field and how they grew and what they have accomplished so far um now um so now that um you know what languages are i'm just gonna introduce and tell you what our next series is going to be about so our next series is basically um using a mobile coding app to code and um the mobile coding app that we're going to be using is decoder very simple amazing love it easily uh you can use it very easily um it's a very basic and a very um nice and simplistic um app for mobile coding and you can't use it for big things but for a basic level for just understanding and learning purposes this is possibly one of the best apps that you could use um very easy to download you can download it on all ios or android devices um and it's completely free so the two main languages that we will be covering in our upcoming mobile coding series is html and css and to get a more understanding of what these two languages are and they're used on a daily basis please have a look at our next youtube video um that's it for now thank you so much for watching again please follow us on all our social media sites and subscribe to our youtube channel for more amazing content thank you bye
