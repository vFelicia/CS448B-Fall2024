00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - youtube channel hope you guys are coping
00:04 - well during quarantine
00:06 - um as you guys know we've done quite a
00:08 - few series
00:09 - and stimulated concepts on this youtube
00:11 - channel
00:12 - um i just wanted to give you a brief
00:14 - summary before we introduce our new
00:16 - series that we're going to start
00:18 - so let's begin
00:22 - okay so this is just a quick summary of
00:24 - coding and programming
00:27 - um you've seen the craze for learning
00:29 - code
00:30 - but what exactly is coding coding is
00:33 - what makes it possible for
00:34 - us to create computer software apps
00:37 - and websites your browser your os
00:41 - the apps on your phone facebook this
00:44 - website google slides
00:46 - they're all made with code if you don't
00:49 - know
00:49 - the first thing about coding you've come
00:51 - to the right place
00:52 - we've put together a bunch of videos and
00:55 - um
00:56 - series to help you understand coding and
00:58 - the different languages
01:00 - that are available for you to code for
01:02 - different uses
01:04 - um so why do we code
01:07 - outside of the implication of coding
01:09 - which looks good on your resume for your
01:11 - university
01:12 - um coding actually does boost skills
01:15 - which are actually useful for most
01:17 - jobs uh problem solving and logical
01:20 - logics are like the two main or the most
01:22 - important reasons why people code
01:25 - um doing such codes activates your left
01:28 - side of the brain which is basically
01:29 - your problem-solving brain which
01:31 - would help you later think faster in um
01:34 - stimulated subjects at least
01:37 - um what what is coding used for
01:41 - simply foot coding is used for
01:42 - communication with computers
01:44 - uh people use coding to give computers
01:46 - and other machine instructions on what
01:49 - actions to perform further we use it to
01:52 - program the websites apps and other
01:54 - technologies that we use or interact
01:56 - with
01:57 - on a daily basis um some
02:00 - coding jobs uh there are a bunch of
02:03 - coding jobs that you can do
02:05 - um so in the software development which
02:08 - is basically a massive field with
02:10 - plenty of career opportunities um
02:13 - there's
02:13 - coding like software engineering cloud
02:16 - engineering and database developer
02:18 - for artificial intelligence coding there
02:21 - is
02:22 - um machine learning engineering deep
02:24 - learning engineering data scientists
02:27 - and mobile development and our final
02:30 - category
02:30 - is web development which includes front
02:32 - and back developer and ux developer
02:35 - um to know more about these i think it's
02:37 - the best if you google it
02:38 - because we don't want to go too much
02:40 - into it
02:42 - um now usually when we think about
02:45 - coding we associate
02:46 - it mostly to stem related subjects but i
02:49 - think
02:50 - it is important for us to understand how
02:52 - coding is used
02:53 - in medical fields today
02:56 - medical coding professionals help ensure
02:58 - that codes are applied correctly
03:01 - during medical billing process which
03:03 - includes abstracting the information
03:05 - from a documentation
03:07 - assigning the appropriate codes and
03:09 - creating a claim to be paid by
03:11 - insurance carriers accurate coding is
03:14 - critical
03:15 - an incorrect code becomes a permanent
03:18 - part of a patient's record
03:20 - it can affect a patient's healthcare and
03:22 - delay physician reimbursement
03:24 - because the patient's claim may be
03:26 - rejected due to an incorrect code
03:29 - um so coding is also used for
03:34 - making all the technologies um like ct
03:36 - scans
03:37 - and um ultrasound and stuff like that
03:40 - because
03:41 - like machines work based on the code
03:43 - that we give them so
03:44 - in order for that to work coding is very
03:47 - important and putting in the right
03:49 - code is more important so uh
03:52 - you could take coding and then go to a
03:54 - medical field and maybe do
03:56 - bioengineering which would help you make
03:58 - equipment that could be used for
04:00 - surgeries
04:02 - um that'd be it thank you so much for
04:05 - watching our video please follow us on
04:06 - all our social media platforms and
04:08 - subscribe to our channel for more videos
04:12 - bye

hello everyone welcome back to our youtube channel hope you guys are coping well during quarantine um as you guys know we've done quite a few series and stimulated concepts on this youtube channel um i just wanted to give you a brief summary before we introduce our new series that we're going to start so let's begin okay so this is just a quick summary of coding and programming um you've seen the craze for learning code but what exactly is coding coding is what makes it possible for us to create computer software apps and websites your browser your os the apps on your phone facebook this website google slides they're all made with code if you don't know the first thing about coding you've come to the right place we've put together a bunch of videos and um series to help you understand coding and the different languages that are available for you to code for different uses um so why do we code outside of the implication of coding which looks good on your resume for your university um coding actually does boost skills which are actually useful for most jobs uh problem solving and logical logics are like the two main or the most important reasons why people code um doing such codes activates your left side of the brain which is basically your problemsolving brain which would help you later think faster in um stimulated subjects at least um what what is coding used for simply foot coding is used for communication with computers uh people use coding to give computers and other machine instructions on what actions to perform further we use it to program the websites apps and other technologies that we use or interact with on a daily basis um some coding jobs uh there are a bunch of coding jobs that you can do um so in the software development which is basically a massive field with plenty of career opportunities um there's coding like software engineering cloud engineering and database developer for artificial intelligence coding there is um machine learning engineering deep learning engineering data scientists and mobile development and our final category is web development which includes front and back developer and ux developer um to know more about these i think it's the best if you google it because we don't want to go too much into it um now usually when we think about coding we associate it mostly to stem related subjects but i think it is important for us to understand how coding is used in medical fields today medical coding professionals help ensure that codes are applied correctly during medical billing process which includes abstracting the information from a documentation assigning the appropriate codes and creating a claim to be paid by insurance carriers accurate coding is critical an incorrect code becomes a permanent part of a patient's record it can affect a patient's healthcare and delay physician reimbursement because the patient's claim may be rejected due to an incorrect code um so coding is also used for making all the technologies um like ct scans and um ultrasound and stuff like that because like machines work based on the code that we give them so in order for that to work coding is very important and putting in the right code is more important so uh you could take coding and then go to a medical field and maybe do bioengineering which would help you make equipment that could be used for surgeries um that'd be it thank you so much for watching our video please follow us on all our social media platforms and subscribe to our channel for more videos bye
