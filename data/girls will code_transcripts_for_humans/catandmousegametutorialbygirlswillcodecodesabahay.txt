00:07 - hi
00:07 - my name is sarah and today i'm going to
00:10 - be teaching you how to code a
00:11 - cat and mouse game so basically the way
00:14 - this works is
00:15 - the mouse is trying to get to a
00:17 - strawberry in order to score points
00:20 - and um the cat will be chasing around
00:23 - the mouse
00:24 - each time and if the cat catches the
00:27 - mouse then the game will end
00:28 - but until then the mouse is trying to
00:31 - eat as many strawberries as they can
00:36 - [Music]
00:40 - we are going to start off programming
00:42 - this game by adding some
00:44 - code for this mouse so i'm going to
00:46 - start over here in events
00:47 - and say when the green flag is clicked
00:50 - i want the mouse to go to the center so
00:53 - i want to always start the game with the
00:55 - mouse
00:56 - being in the same place if i click the
00:58 - green flag down you'll see the mouse
00:59 - goes to the center
01:01 - and the next step is to add in the
01:02 - functions of the different keys
01:04 - so first i'm going to use a forever loop
01:07 - to make sure that
01:08 - the code we add within that paragraph
01:10 - will execute as long as the game is
01:13 - being played
01:14 - and then i'm going to add three if
01:17 - statements
01:19 - for each of the keys that either rotate
01:23 - the mouse or move it forward
01:26 - so over here in sensing you can use
01:29 - these options
01:30 - if the left arrow key is pressed then
01:33 - something will happen
01:35 - if the right arrow key is pressed and
01:38 - something will happen
01:39 - and up here if the up arrow keys
01:42 - processing will happen and then if we go
01:44 - here to motions you'll see that you have
01:46 - the option to say
01:49 - if the left arrow key is pressed it will
01:50 - turn 15 degrees to the left
01:53 - if the right key is pressed it'll turn
01:54 - 15 degrees to the right
01:56 - and then here we have the option to say
01:58 - when the up arrow key is pressed the
02:00 - mouse will move 10 steps forward so if
02:02 - we give that a trial run now
02:04 - left key right key and the up key
02:14 - the next step in programming this game
02:16 - is to add some code for
02:18 - our strawberry to appear and disappear
02:20 - in random places
02:21 - so i'm going to start off with some
02:24 - event block which says when the green
02:26 - flag is clicked
02:28 - and then i'm going to add another
02:29 - forever loop just like we did for the
02:31 - mouse
02:33 - but instead of what we did with the
02:35 - mouse where we told the mouse to go
02:37 - center of the screen
02:38 - we are going to use this other foot
02:40 - block that says
02:41 - the strawberry will go to a random
02:44 - position
02:45 - you'll see what happens right now is the
02:47 - strawberry sort of zigzagging everywhere
02:49 - so in order to
02:51 - fix this issue we are going to use this
02:53 - control block
02:54 - wait seven milliseconds let's say two
02:57 - seconds
02:58 - and now you'll see that the strawberry
03:00 - stays in place for two seconds before
03:02 - moving to a new random location
03:09 - [Music]
03:12 - okay the third part of programming this
03:14 - game is to add some code for the cat
03:16 - so the cat moves around always following
03:19 - the mouse so we're going to start same
03:21 - way we did with the other sprites when
03:22 - the green flag is clicked
03:24 - and instead of going to random position
03:28 - or to the center of the screen
03:29 - we want the cat to start the game some
03:32 - spaces away from the mouse so i'm going
03:34 - to say the cat starts
03:36 - at the coordinates 200 200.
03:40 - so it's quite far away from the center
03:41 - of the screen
03:43 - and then because i want the player
03:47 - to have some time to maneuver the mouse
03:49 - before the cat starts chasing it
03:51 - i'm going to tell the cat to wait one
03:53 - second before it starts moving
03:56 - next i'm going to add in a forever loop
03:59 - and there's this really useful block up
04:01 - here
04:02 - it's a point towards code box
04:06 - so what i want this to say is i want the
04:08 - cat to always be pointing towards
04:11 - the mouse and
04:14 - i also want the cat to always be moving
04:17 - towards mass so it's always pointing in
04:19 - the direction of the mouse it's always
04:20 - moving it will always be moving
04:22 - for its mask and let's say it's going to
04:24 - be three steps at a time so it's a bit
04:26 - slower than the mouse as well
04:31 - [Music]
04:33 - the next important part of this game is
04:36 - to create a score function where each
04:38 - time a mouse
04:39 - eats a strawberry the score goes up by
04:41 - one so we are going to go over here to
04:43 - variables and i'm going to make a
04:45 - variable
04:46 - i'm going to call it score
04:49 - okay and the first thing i'm going to do
04:53 - is i'm going to say
04:54 - set score to zero when the green flag is
04:56 - clicked so each time the game restarts
04:58 - the score also
04:59 - resets back to zero
05:02 - and then i'm going to create a broadcast
05:06 - message that will tell
05:07 - other sprites when a point has been
05:10 - scored
05:11 - so i'm going to say if
05:15 - the mouse is touching the strawberry
05:18 - meaning
05:18 - it's eating it sorry a strawberry
05:22 - then it will broadcast
05:26 - a message and i will need to create a
05:29 - new message here
05:30 - i'm going to call it point score
05:35 - okay so if the mouse catches strawberry
05:39 - it will save points for it
05:40 - then we're going to go over here to the
05:41 - strawberry
05:43 - and we are going to say
05:47 - when i receive the broadcast masters
05:50 - point scored
05:52 - first i am going to hide
05:56 - so that the mass can't keep scoring
05:58 - points so i'm going to hide
06:00 - and then i am going to
06:04 - change my score by one so it will go up
06:08 - by one point
06:12 - [Music]
06:14 - the next important part is to create
06:17 - a game over sequence in order to do that
06:21 - we are going to do something quite
06:23 - similar to what we did with the score
06:25 - functions
06:26 - and i'm going to create a
06:29 - if then statement so
06:33 - this time if the cat is touching the
06:36 - mouse
06:38 - then this game over sequence will be
06:40 - initiated
06:41 - so we are going to accomplish this by
06:43 - creating
06:44 - another broadcast message but instead of
06:47 - point score this one is going to say
06:50 - game over
06:55 - another important part of this game over
06:57 - sequence is the background so we want
06:59 - background to tell the player that it
07:01 - says game over so over here on the right
07:03 - you can change backdrops
07:05 - and if we go up here in the upper left
07:07 - you can see all the different backdrops
07:09 - we have available
07:10 - i'm going to add um two more
07:14 - which will be the ones that i'm using so
07:17 - i can delete this one up here so i one
07:20 - just called light which is the original
07:22 - name of the
07:23 - costume of the background and then here
07:25 - is another one and i'm going to call
07:27 - this one game over and i'm
07:30 - actually going to also add in some text
07:33 - that says game over on the backdrop
07:37 - itself
07:41 - and okay i want to move it to the center
07:44 - and then here
07:45 - we go back to the code so remember
07:48 - there is a game over broadcast that i
07:50 - sent out when the cat catches the mouse
07:52 - so i'm going to say
07:54 - when the backdrop receives this game
07:56 - over message
07:57 - only then will it switch the game over
08:01 - back up
08:03 - and i also want to remember that
08:06 - when the green flag is clicked the
08:09 - background will
08:10 - switch itself back to the original one
08:12 - where it does not say
08:14 - game over one of the finishing touches
08:17 - to this game is to make sure that when
08:19 - the game over sequence is initiated all
08:22 - the code for the other sprites actually
08:24 - stops running so that the player won't
08:25 - be able to continue
08:27 - playing the game after they've lost so
08:29 - we are going to add in
08:30 - an event function where it says when i
08:33 - receive
08:34 - game over broadcast when the master sees
08:36 - the game over
08:38 - broadcast first it's going to hide
08:41 - so that it won't cover the game over
08:43 - message and then it's going to do
08:45 - something really important it's going to
08:47 - stop
08:50 - all scripts in all of these different
08:52 - spreads so it's going to stop all the
08:54 - code from running
08:55 - after it receives the game over
08:57 - broadcast
08:58 - and that way here won't be able to
09:00 - continue playing the game and something
09:02 - important to remember
09:03 - is when you use this hide block you want
09:06 - to make sure that
09:07 - when the game starts again the sprite
09:10 - will
09:10 - show itself so
09:15 - when the game starts it will show itself
09:16 - and when the game ends it will hide
09:18 - itself
09:18 - we are going to add that over here with
09:22 - the strawberry so
09:23 - when i receive game over
09:27 - i'm going to
09:31 - hide and when the green flag is clicked
09:35 - i'm going to show myself
09:39 - it's important that we add it inside
09:41 - this forever function here because
09:43 - um here when each time a point is for
09:46 - the strawberry is actually going to hide
09:48 - itself again so we need the strawberry
09:50 - to show itself again
09:52 - each time it moves to a new location and
09:55 - also
09:56 - when the game starts for the first time
10:00 - we are going to add something similar
10:01 - for the cat when i receive game over
10:05 - i'm going to hide but when the game
10:08 - starts it's going to
10:09 - show itself so now we can try playing
10:12 - our game
10:13 - so we score points
10:16 - here and you can see the cat is
10:18 - following the mouse around
10:20 - and when the cat catches the mouth um
10:22 - the game ends
10:23 - so thank you so much i hope you enjoyed
10:26 - and have a great time
10:30 - coding
10:33 - [Music]
10:39 - [Music]
10:40 - you

hi my name is sarah and today i'm going to be teaching you how to code a cat and mouse game so basically the way this works is the mouse is trying to get to a strawberry in order to score points and um the cat will be chasing around the mouse each time and if the cat catches the mouse then the game will end but until then the mouse is trying to eat as many strawberries as they can we are going to

i'm going to start off with some event block which says when the green flag is clicked and then i'm going to add another forever loop just like we did for the mouse but instead of what we did with the

going to start same way we did with the other sprites when the green flag is clicked and instead of going to random position or to the center of the screen we want the cat to start the game some spaces away from the mouse so i'm going to say the cat starts at the coordinates 200 200. so it's quite far away from the center of the screen and then because i want the player to have some time to maneuver the mouse before the cat starts chasing it i'm going to tell the cat to wait one second before it starts moving next i'm going to add in a forever loop and there's this really useful block up here it's a point towards code box so what i want this to say is i want the cat to always be pointing towards the mouse and i also want the cat to always be moving towards mass so it's always pointing in the direction of the mouse it's always moving it will always be moving for its mask and let's say it's going to be three steps at a time so it's a bit slower than the mouse as well the next important part of this game is to create a score function where each time a mouse eats a strawberry the score goes up by one so we are going to go over here to variables and i'm going to make a variable i'm going to call it score okay and the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to say set score to zero when the green flag is clicked so each time the game restarts the score also resets back to zero and then i'm going to create a broadcast message that will tell other sprites when a point has been scored so i'm going to say if the mouse is touching the strawberry meaning it's eating it sorry a strawberry then it will broadcast a message and i will need to create a new message here i'm going to call it point score okay so if the mouse catches strawberry it will save points for it then we're going to go over here to the strawberry and we are going to say when i receive the broadcast masters point scored first i am going to hide so that the mass can't keep scoring points so i'm going to hide and then i am going to change my score by one so it will go up by one point the next important part is to create a game over sequence in order to do that we are going to do something quite similar to what we did with the score functions and i'm going to create a if then statement so this time if the cat is touching the mouse then this game over sequence will be initiated so we are going to accomplish this by creating another broadcast message but instead of point score this one is going to say game over another important part of this game over sequence is the background so we want background to tell the player that it says game over so over here on the right you can change backdrops and if we go up here in the upper left you can see all the different backdrops we have available i'm going to add um two more which will be the ones that i'm using so i can delete this one up here so i one just called light which is the original name of the costume of the background and then here is another one and i'm going to call this one game over and i'm actually going to also add in some text that says game over on the backdrop itself and okay i want to move it to the center and then here we go back to the code so remember there is a game over broadcast that i sent out when the cat catches the mouse so i'm going to say when the backdrop receives this game over message only then will it switch the game over back up and i also want to remember that when the green flag is clicked the background will switch itself back to the original one where it does not say game over one of the finishing touches to this game is to make sure that when the game over sequence is initiated all the code for the other sprites actually stops running so that the player won't be able to continue playing the game after they've lost so we are going to add in an event function where it says when i receive game over broadcast when the master sees the game over broadcast first it's going to hide so that it won't cover the game over message and then it's going to do something really important it's going to stop all scripts in all of these different spreads so it's going to stop all the code from running after it receives the game over broadcast and that way here won't be able to continue playing the game and something important to remember is when you use this hide block you want to make sure that when the game starts again the sprite will show itself so when the game starts it will show itself and when the game ends it will hide itself we are going to add that over here with the strawberry so when i receive game over i'm going to hide and when the green flag is clicked i'm going to show myself it's important that we add it inside this forever function here because um here when each time a point is for the strawberry is actually going to hide itself again so we need the strawberry to show itself again each time it moves to a new location and also when the game starts for the first time we are going to add something similar for the cat when i receive game over i'm going to hide but when the game starts it's going to show itself so now we can try playing our game so we score points here and you can see the cat is following the mouse around and when the cat catches the mouth um the game ends so thank you so much i hope you enjoyed and have a great time coding you
