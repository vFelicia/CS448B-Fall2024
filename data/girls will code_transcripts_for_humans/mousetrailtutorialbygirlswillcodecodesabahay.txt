00:03 - hi
00:04 - my name is sarah and today i'm going to
00:06 - be showing you how to create
00:08 - a mouse trail with a sprite and also
00:12 - how you can make patterns on the screen
00:14 - with
00:15 - the trail that you make
00:17 - [Music]
00:24 - okay the first step is to
00:27 - create a sprite that will follow around
00:29 - your mouse so
00:30 - i chose a ball for my sprite i'm gonna
00:33 - go over here to costumes and change it
00:35 - to blue
00:35 - because i like blue and then
00:39 - you can make it any color you want you
00:41 - can pick any sprite
00:42 - and i'm going to say when the green flag
00:44 - is clicked
00:47 - i'm going to go to
00:50 - the mouse pointer then i'm going to add
00:54 - in
00:54 - a forever loop to make sure that the
00:56 - code
00:57 - continues to run and i'm going to say
00:59 - that
01:02 - it's always the sprite is always going
01:04 - to point towards
01:06 - the mouse pointer and it's going to
01:10 - move
01:15 - whatever distance it is from the mouse
01:18 - pointer so
01:18 - it's always moving to the mouse pointer
01:22 - and i'm also going to add in a control
01:26 - that's going to make it wait a little
01:30 - bit
01:31 - um that's enough time it's a very short
01:34 - time but basically
01:35 - this make sure your mouse isn't on top
01:38 - of the sprite when you're moving it
01:39 - around and that sprite is a little bit
01:41 - behind it so there we go
01:45 - [Music]
01:48 - okay the second step now is to create a
01:52 - clone
01:53 - to create clones of the sprite to make a
01:55 - trail behind
01:56 - it so we need to add in
02:00 - this block where it will create a clone
02:03 - of myself i'm going to add it to this
02:05 - forever block and just put it at the top
02:07 - and then we're going to add this new
02:10 - block when i start as a clone
02:13 - and then i'm going to
02:18 - add this repeat block and i'm going to
02:20 - say repeat 50 times
02:22 - [Music]
02:23 - and then i'm going to go over here to
02:25 - looks and this is what's going to create
02:27 - the trail
02:29 - and i'm going to say oops
02:32 - i'm going to change the ghost effect
02:36 - by 10. and this makes it a little bit
02:39 - transparent yeah there we go so now
02:41 - you've created a trail
02:43 - and another thing that i want to do is i
02:45 - want to change the color
02:47 - so i'm going to also add
02:51 - a change color effect and you can make
02:54 - it by 10
02:55 - it will look like this or you can make
02:58 - it by
02:59 - make it 25 let's try again the colors
03:02 - are different it's more like a rainbow
03:04 - so you can play around with those
03:06 - [Music]
03:11 - the third and final step of this is to
03:14 - add
03:14 - a pen extension so that you can create a
03:17 - pattern
03:18 - with your trailing sprite so
03:21 - we're gonna go down here in the bottom
03:23 - left corner and you
03:24 - just click on this pen extension
03:28 - sorry and then
03:31 - we're going to go to control this is
03:34 - really fun
03:35 - and interesting so we're going to first
03:37 - go to control
03:38 - and you have this function here if then
03:41 - so um we don't want it to be drawing on
03:45 - the screen
03:47 - like whenever we move our mouse around
03:49 - so i'm gonna say
03:51 - only if the mouse is pressed down
03:54 - then it will draw something and over
03:57 - here
03:58 - there's this block stamp
04:02 - and this means whenever you press your
04:04 - mouse whatever
04:06 - like image is on the screen it will be
04:08 - sort of stamped onto the background
04:10 - so it's like you're drawing something
04:12 - and then if else
04:14 - i'm going to say pen up so it's not
04:16 - drawing anything anymore
04:19 - and so you can see when i click it it
04:22 - leaves that
04:22 - trail so i'm clicking my mouse here and
04:26 - here
04:27 - and that's what it looks like and then
04:30 - another important thing is that we erase
04:32 - the screen
04:34 - um once it starts again so that
04:38 - when we restart it it will
04:42 - have a new clean blank slate
04:45 - um thank you so much for watching and i
04:48 - hope you enjoyed and i hope you have a
04:50 - lot of fun
04:57 - [Applause]
04:59 - bye
