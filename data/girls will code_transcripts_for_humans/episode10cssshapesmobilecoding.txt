00:02 - hi everyone in this mobile coding series
00:04 - video i'll be teaching you how to use
00:05 - css to create shape on the mobile coding
00:08 - app decoder
00:09 - so first of all we're going to be
00:10 - learning how to make a square or
00:12 - rectangle
00:13 - on the html file so i have my html file
00:18 - as
00:18 - always then the first thing you want to
00:21 - do is create a class within a div
00:23 - so div class equals
00:28 - rectangle or you can name it whatever
00:30 - you want but i'll
00:32 - name mine rectangle for the sake of
00:33 - simplicity then close the div
00:36 - and make a closing div so backslash
00:39 - div then closing
00:43 - so there are three properties essential
00:45 - in making a square or a rectangle and
00:47 - those are height
00:48 - width and background color so to do this
00:51 - go to css
00:52 - and to reference your class that you
00:54 - made type in dot and your class name
00:57 - since i named my
00:58 - class rectangle i'll be typing in
01:00 - rectangle
01:02 - then putting in my brackets
01:06 - within these brackets you can then put
01:08 - in your css
01:09 - so as i said the three properties are
01:11 - height
01:13 - sorry height so let's make the height
01:16 - 100 px
01:19 - then semicolon then next we have width
01:24 - um if you want to make it a square you
01:27 - could also do 100 px but since mine's a
01:29 - rectangle or maybe 200 px
01:32 - and lastly we have background colors
01:34 - like that
01:38 - dash color
01:41 - and i'll make my background color yellow
01:47 - so when i go back to my html and i press
01:49 - play i now have a rectangle
01:52 - that is 100 px in height 200 px in width
01:56 - and has a background color of yellow so
02:00 - the next thing we're going to do in this
02:01 - video is learn how to make
02:03 - a circle now that we know how to make a
02:05 - square it's a very similar process
02:07 - except
02:08 - we have one extra attribute which i will
02:10 - get to sorry property which i will get
02:12 - to later
02:14 - so once again we can make a div sorry
02:17 - div class equals
02:21 - quotation marks circle
02:25 - then once again closing
02:29 - then closing dip
02:37 - so to make a circle the css properties
02:40 - will
02:40 - we will need are once again height and
02:42 - width
02:43 - but including besides height and width
02:46 - and color
02:47 - we'll also need the property of border
02:50 - radius
02:51 - so let's try it out so dot
02:54 - circle or whatever you named your class
02:58 - then brackets then within the brackets
03:00 - we have height
03:03 - let's make it the same thing as last
03:05 - time so
03:06 - 100 px
03:13 - also 100 px
03:16 - sorry 100 px
03:21 - and um background color
03:30 - let's make it blue
03:33 - and most importantly border radius
03:38 - so this determines how curved your
03:41 - square will be
03:42 - and if it's curved to the max then that
03:44 - makes a circle
03:46 - so let's make it 50px
03:51 - so when i go back to my html and i press
03:53 - play i have my circle
03:55 - it's right below the rectangle and it's
03:57 - blue and it has a height of 100px
04:00 - and a width of 100px so that is it for
04:03 - today's video
04:04 - hope you enjoyed and thank you for
04:06 - watching make sure to check the other
04:08 - decoder videos on mobile coding if you
04:10 - haven't yet to learn more
04:12 - bye
