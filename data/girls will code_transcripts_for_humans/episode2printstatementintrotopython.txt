00:00 - hi everyone this is the second video of
00:02 - the intro to python series
00:04 - and in this video we are going to be
00:05 - talking about variables and data types
00:09 - when printing things out in python we
00:10 - are providing text that we want to be
00:12 - printed out
00:14 - text in python is considered a specific
00:16 - type of data
00:17 - called a string it's called a string
00:20 - because it's
00:21 - a series of characters so in the
00:24 - previous video when we printed the
00:25 - following statement
00:26 - we were actually printing out a string a
00:29 - string is denoted by
00:30 - quotation marks so everything between
00:33 - these quotation marks
00:36 - is part of the string and as mentioned
00:38 - in the previous video you can use double
00:40 - quotes or single quotes
00:42 - but make sure you use both you use the
00:44 - same on each end
00:46 - so here we have some data of type string
00:48 - and that data
00:49 - is my name if i wanted to store this
00:52 - data so i can use it later on
00:54 - i need to store it in a variable a
00:56 - variable as its name suggests also
00:58 - allows you to deal with data that
00:59 - changes over time
01:01 - so in this example i am going to be
01:03 - defining a variable called
01:04 - name and i'm going to assign it a string
01:08 - of my name so i'm going to do name
01:12 - which is the name of our variable i'm
01:14 - going to put the equal sign which means
01:16 - assign this value to this
01:19 - variable so now i have my name stored in
01:21 - the memory of my computer
01:23 - and to access it i use the name of my
01:26 - variable
01:26 - so in this case the name of our variable
01:28 - is name so whenever you create a
01:30 - variable the name you set for it
01:32 - should describe what data is stored
01:34 - inside the variable
01:36 - in a concise manner so in this case as
01:38 - i'm storing my name
01:40 - i call the variable name so here is the
01:42 - general syntax of creating a variable
01:45 - you put the variable name you then put
01:47 - an equals to sign and then you put the
01:49 - data
01:49 - that you want to store inside the
01:50 - variable so in this previous example
01:52 - over here our variable name
01:54 - was name there's our equal sign and the
01:56 - data that we want to store inside it
01:58 - is a string containing my name so now if
02:01 - i wanted to print out the data that is
02:02 - stored inside this variable name
02:05 - i put a print statement and inside the
02:07 - print statement i would put the name of
02:08 - the variable
02:09 - and the name of the variable over here
02:10 - as we've defined is name
02:13 - so now what that's going to do is when i
02:15 - run this code after saving it
02:19 - as you can see it prints out locks
02:22 - and that's because on line 12 where we
02:25 - say print name
02:26 - what the computer does is it looks at
02:29 - the value stored inside this variable
02:31 - which is
02:32 - laksh the string and it's going to print
02:35 - out the string
02:36 - so that's exactly the same as doing this
02:38 - but the beauty of variables is that it
02:40 - allows you to deal with data that
02:41 - changes over time
02:42 - so now let's say that i change my name
02:45 - to reassign
02:46 - a different value to the previous
02:48 - variable that we've created
02:49 - what i'm going to do first is type the
02:51 - variable name so the name of our
02:53 - variable
02:53 - is name so name and then we're going to
02:55 - put an equals to sign just like we do
02:57 - when we
02:58 - assign an initial value and now what i'm
03:00 - going to do is type in
03:02 - my new name so let's just say aryan
03:07 - and now what i do is if i print out
03:10 - name print out the value stored inside
03:13 - the variable name
03:15 - what that's going to do now is
03:18 - as you can see first sorry let me save
03:20 - the code first
03:21 - so as you can see previously it printed
03:23 - out lux when we printed out
03:25 - this statement because at line 12 the
03:28 - value stored inside our variable was
03:30 - still locked but by the time we reach
03:33 - line
03:33 - 16 because in line 14 we've reassigned
03:36 - the value to of our variable
03:38 - it's now going to print out the new
03:40 - value so now we've looked at strings but
03:42 - there are also other data types
03:44 - we're now going to look at the two main
03:45 - other data types
03:47 - integers and booleans now an integer is
03:49 - exactly what its name suggests
03:51 - it's an integer it's a number if you
03:52 - want to store something like your
03:54 - h or the date or any other number
03:57 - you use the data type integer just like
04:00 - we did with strings we first write the
04:02 - variable name
04:03 - so since i want to store my age i'm
04:05 - going to name the variable h
04:08 - but you know you can name these
04:09 - variables whatever you like but it's
04:11 - always good practice to give a variable
04:13 - a name that describes
04:14 - what data is stored inside of it so
04:16 - since i want to store my age i'm going
04:18 - to call
04:18 - my variable age but once again you could
04:21 - just
04:22 - use any value for this you know but i'm
04:24 - going to go with age
04:26 - and just like we did with strings what
04:28 - we first do is create an equal to
04:31 - and what that does is whatever value we
04:34 - put
04:34 - after it's going to assign that value to
04:37 - the variable
04:38 - so since my age is 16 i'm going to type
04:42 - 16. so you know as you noticed earlier
04:45 - in strings we use quotation marks but
04:47 - with integers you do not use anything
04:49 - you just type the variable name put the
04:51 - equal sign and then type the number you
04:53 - want to store
04:54 - the last data type we will discuss is
04:57 - booleans
04:58 - these are very simple they just have two
05:01 - possible values
05:02 - true or false so if i wanted to store
05:05 - whether
05:06 - it is raining outside or not since there
05:08 - are only two possibilities
05:10 - raining or not raining we will use
05:13 - booleans
05:14 - just like the previous two we first
05:16 - write the variable name
05:18 - so i'm going to call this variable is
05:20 - raining
05:22 - and then i'm going to set it equal to
05:25 - either true or false
05:28 - and as of now since it's not raining
05:30 - outside i am going to name it false
05:32 - and once again you do not use quotation
05:34 - marks otherwise that would create a
05:36 - string
05:37 - one important thing to note is that we
05:39 - write the true or false with capital t
05:43 - and capital f if you write true or false
05:46 - with lowercase t or f like i'm doing
05:48 - right now
05:49 - that is going to be incorrect so we want
05:51 - to make sure that we put capital f for
05:53 - false
05:53 - and capital t for true once again just
05:56 - to recap
05:58 - what we want to do is whenever we create
05:59 - a variable we first want to give it a
06:01 - name
06:01 - so we give a variable name
06:04 - a variable name and then we put our
06:07 - equals to
06:08 - and then we put the data that we want to
06:10 - store inside the variable
06:12 - it could be a string
06:15 - it could be an integer
06:18 - like such or it could be true
06:21 - or even false so one thing i'm going to
06:24 - be asking you to think about right now
06:26 - is
06:27 - whether there's any difference between
06:29 - the following two lines
06:31 - besides the variable names and i'm going
06:34 - to discuss the answer to this
06:35 - in the beginning of the next video so
06:38 - another thing i'm going to ask you to do
06:39 - is try and attempt these two
06:44 - questions i'm going to be discussing the
06:46 - answer at the end of this video
06:48 - so before you look at the answer please
06:50 - try and do it by yourself
06:52 - so now i'm going to be discussing the
06:53 - answers the first one is printing your
06:56 - name and age using
06:57 - variables so first let's create our
07:00 - variables
07:01 - you know the first thing we want to do
07:02 - when we create variables is give our
07:04 - variable a name
07:05 - so i'm going to call this variable my
07:07 - name
07:08 - and set it equal to a string
07:13 - of whatever so you guys type in your
07:16 - name and i type in
07:17 - locks and then the next is our
07:21 - age so i'm going to create a variable
07:23 - called my age
07:24 - and set it equal to an integer because
07:27 - your age is a number
07:28 - so 16 in my case and now i'm going to
07:31 - print both these variables
07:33 - so the first is our print statement and
07:35 - then we put our
07:36 - opening and closing parentheses and then
07:39 - we put the name of our variable over
07:41 - here
07:42 - so my name to print out the first value
07:45 - and to print out the second value we put
07:48 - in
07:49 - my age the next question
07:52 - is creating a variable called older than
07:54 - 12 and setting it to true if you are
07:57 - and false if you're not so like we did
08:01 - in the previous question we first
08:02 - defined the variable's name
08:04 - so in this case the question tells us
08:06 - what name we want to give our variable
08:08 - so let's type in the name that the
08:10 - question asks us older
08:12 - than 12 and now we
08:16 - set it equal to if we are older than 12
08:19 - or not
08:19 - in my case i'm going to set that equal
08:21 - to true and there you go these are the
08:23 - answers to the exercise
08:25 - i hope you guys enjoyed this video stay
08:27 - tuned for the next one and leave any
08:29 - questions you have
08:30 - in the comments below thank you for
08:35 - watching
