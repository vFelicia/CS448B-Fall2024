00:02 - hey everyone today i'm going to be
00:04 - teaching you how to use basic css
00:06 - on your html file through the mobile
00:08 - coding app decoder
00:11 - so first off i made my html document and
00:14 - the gwc
00:16 - then within the body i added the h1
00:18 - hello world
00:19 - so if i press play you can see my blank
00:21 - document
00:22 - with hello world on top on the top left
00:27 - so in this video we're going to be
00:28 - talking about three types of ways you
00:30 - can add css
00:31 - we have inline internal and external
00:34 - so the first way is inline usually use
00:37 - inline if you want to apply styles to a
00:39 - single html element
00:41 - so for instance if i wanted to make
00:43 - hello world blue
00:45 - within here i can add the word style
00:47 - equals
00:49 - then quotation marks within the
00:51 - quotation marks i can then add whatever
00:53 - style attributes i want to apply
00:55 - such as font colors background and many
00:59 - other things
01:00 - so we're going to keep it simple and
01:02 - just make hello world blue
01:05 - so what i can then do is put color
01:09 - semicolon then
01:12 - so that i'm finished i can press the
01:14 - play button
01:15 - and as you can see hello world is now
01:18 - color blue
01:21 - so the next way you can apply css onto
01:23 - your html document
01:25 - is through using internal css so you
01:27 - would do this by making a section
01:30 - called style within the inter within the
01:32 - head section
01:34 - then in this section you can reference
01:36 - whatever element you have on your
01:38 - document
01:39 - and then declare whatever style
01:41 - attributes you want to apply to it
01:43 - so for instance if i want to change the
01:45 - color of hello world again
01:47 - what i can do is put h1
01:50 - put the brackets and within these
01:52 - brackets i can put whatever style
01:53 - attributes i want to apply
01:55 - so if i want to make the color yellow
01:57 - for instance
01:59 - i can put in yellow semicolon
02:02 - then you have to close the style section
02:10 - so here if i want to see what i have i
02:13 - can press the play button and as you can
02:15 - see hello world is now yellow
02:18 - the last way you can apply css onto your
02:21 - html file
02:22 - is they're using external css so what
02:25 - external allows you to do is it allows
02:27 - you to define the style for many html
02:29 - pages all within one css file
02:32 - so in this docu in this html file
02:36 - if i want to apply css using an external
02:39 - file
02:39 - i can go onto.css on the decoder page
02:43 - i can then reference the element i want
02:46 - to change
02:47 - the style of so once again it's h1
02:51 - then within these brackets i put next to
02:53 - h1
02:54 - i can then put whatever style i want so
02:56 - once again i'm going to change the color
02:59 - to red
03:02 - so now i can go back to my html document
03:05 - and when i press play
03:06 - the words hello world will be now will
03:08 - now be in red
03:11 - so those are the three different ways
03:13 - you can add css onto your html file and
03:15 - i hope this video helps
