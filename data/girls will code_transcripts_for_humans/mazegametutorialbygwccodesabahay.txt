00:00 - hi guys i hope you guys are doing good
00:02 - during this um tough time of quarantine
00:05 - so i guess you guys are bored by now so
00:07 - i decided to make an
00:08 - another youtube video on um a tutorial
00:11 - for a game on scratch
00:13 - it's a very simple game it's basically
00:15 - the maze game
00:16 - um this game is going to have two stages
00:18 - an easy stage followed by a hard stage
00:20 - i hope you guys enjoy if you have any
00:22 - questions about scratch
00:24 - watch our tutorial video that we've
00:25 - uploaded on youtube
00:27 - or you can dm us on instagram or
00:29 - facebook so let's get right into it
00:32 - so um in this entire game i'm gonna be
00:35 - using
00:35 - five stars two bombs one doctor that's
00:39 - gonna
00:39 - move around and complete the maze and
00:41 - the final
00:42 - uh place to reach is going to be this
00:44 - virus
00:50 - so here's what the doctor looks like all
00:52 - that it has to do is move around
00:54 - and navigate to the final place the
00:57 - current
00:57 - virus by itself is the final destination
01:00 - that the doctor has to reach
01:02 - um these bombs um
01:03 - [Music]
01:05 - these are two bombs and um they will
01:07 - appear every 25 seconds
01:09 - and they're just very fun um aspect of
01:12 - the game
01:12 - these stars um they add a thousand
01:15 - points to the
01:16 - entire game just for fun um
01:19 - i also have a mace as one of the sprites
01:24 - so that that the doctor can go through
01:27 - it
01:27 - and um also these are the two three
01:30 - backgrounds that i'm using this is for
01:31 - the first the easy part of the maze
01:34 - um this is for the second part of the
01:36 - mace and
01:37 - this is the final background which has
01:38 - the word congratulations on it
01:40 - um i will be using all of these a lot
01:43 - throughout the game and in my
01:45 - code so um here's just a small
01:48 - introduction about them
01:50 - as you guys can see i've already set up
01:52 - my entire game
01:54 - um i have a maze i have my stars which
01:57 - would give us extra points in the game
01:59 - um i also have bombs which would appear
02:02 - in 25 seconds
02:04 - and i have my
02:07 - uh final uh place to go which is the
02:11 - virus this is basically a doctor going
02:13 - through a virus
02:14 - and um yeah that's the game
02:21 - so i'm going to start coding the game
02:23 - now um my very first step is going to be
02:26 - coding
02:26 - the doctor's movement so i'm going to
02:29 - start
02:29 - by getting one flag is clicked
02:33 - then i would want
02:36 - it to go to
02:44 - the beginning position which is 212 and
02:46 - negative 160
02:48 - and then i'm going to make a forever
02:49 - loop because we want the movement to
02:51 - keep going
02:52 - and then if um touching
02:55 - if we want down up arrow first so if
02:59 - up arrow is click then we want our
03:02 - y to change by three sorry
03:06 - to change y by three
03:10 - and then we move to the next costume the
03:13 - next costume basically doesn't do much
03:15 - it just
03:16 - stays exactly the same but if you want
03:19 - to like change your customer change the
03:21 - person from like a doctor to maybe
03:24 - say a nurse or something you can do that
03:26 - also
03:27 - now i'm going to change the i'm going to
03:29 - say if touching color black because
03:31 - that's the color of my face
03:32 - if your maze is another color please
03:34 - feel free to
03:36 - put the color that your maze is and i'm
03:38 - going to change
03:39 - y by negative 3 so that it works
03:43 - i'm going to do the same for um all the
03:45 - other keys what i can do is i don't need
03:47 - to redo the whole thing over and over
03:49 - again
03:50 - i can just copy and um copy the entire
03:53 - code and paste it so it just like eases
03:57 - my job i don't have to keep doing it
03:59 - over and over
04:00 - again so i have my forever loop followed
04:02 - by this code and then this
04:04 - i'm going to change my up arrow to down
04:06 - arrow this time change
04:08 - y but i'm going to say negative 3 and
04:11 - i'm going to make this positive three
04:14 - again i'm gonna paste in the other one
04:16 - and i'm gonna
04:17 - put it over here i'm gonna say if now
04:20 - right arrow keys click and then i'm
04:24 - going to this time because it's right
04:26 - and left
04:26 - we want it to be x instead of y
04:30 - so i'm going to say change x
04:33 - by positive 3 and
04:37 - likewise over here i'm going to make it
04:39 - change
04:40 - x by negative three i'm going to delete
04:44 - this
04:44 - and then i'm gonna pull this out copy
04:46 - and paste
04:47 - put this back in put this down
04:51 - make this if left arrow is pressed
04:53 - change the x to negative 3
04:55 - and change the y to positive 3 so
04:58 - that would move that would uh manage the
05:01 - movement of our
05:02 - doctor to go left right up or down
05:05 - now i'm going to do the movement of um
05:07 - oil controlling
05:08 - our time and score because
05:12 - um that's a fun thing you do not need to
05:15 - necessarily do it but
05:16 - i just wanted to have something fun
05:19 - that's why i did it
05:20 - also for score and time i have basically
05:23 - made my own variables because they
05:26 - didn't have variables of show
05:28 - score and time but if you want you
05:31 - you don't need to necessarily do this
05:33 - but i just did it because
05:35 - i think you can learn something new i'm
05:37 - gonna make the entire game for 60
05:39 - seconds
05:39 - so um you can it's like a challenge
05:42 - factor to the game
05:44 - i would also want to know the person's
05:45 - name just in case
05:47 - you'd like to see who the who is playing
05:50 - you can adjust your scoring time
05:53 - uh bars then i'm gonna make a forever
05:56 - loop
05:59 - i'm gonna put it over here uh if you
06:01 - have any questions
06:03 - please let us know on instagram we will
06:05 - be more than happy to help you
06:07 - um then i'm gonna also went forever look
06:10 - so
06:11 - uh i would want my time to keep
06:13 - decreasing by one second
06:15 - and then um after it decreases by one
06:17 - second i would want it to wait for a
06:19 - second
06:20 - and then decrease again um then i would
06:22 - add an
06:23 - if statement so
06:27 - and then uh which means that if my time
06:30 - is equal to zero so if my time is up
06:32 - um i'm gonna drag and drop the time over
06:35 - here
06:36 - then i'm gonna say hide my variable time
06:40 - because i don't want it to be seen over
06:42 - there i mean you can skip this step if
06:44 - you want but
06:45 - i like to keep it this way and then i'm
06:48 - going to say
06:48 - stop all because as soon as the time
06:51 - gets over
06:52 - i want my entire game to stop because
06:55 - then there's
06:55 - oh so you cannot continue so the main
06:58 - point of the game is to finish
07:00 - everything before your time is up
07:02 - um next i am going to be doing is uh
07:06 - how do i move to my second stage of the
07:08 - maze so i'm gonna say
07:10 - if my doctor touches the
07:13 - coronavirus on the top
07:16 - i would want it to switch background
07:19 - backdrop
07:20 - because i have two backdrops um to
07:23 - back i want to switch to backdrop two
07:26 - and then
07:26 - uh i would want the first half of the
07:28 - game to stop so i'm going to say stop
07:30 - all
07:31 - uh now for the movement of the
07:35 - doctor to go to the starting position
07:38 - i'm going to say
07:40 - when flag is clicked then i'm going to i
07:42 - would want the background to
07:44 - switch to background too um
07:50 - oh now i wanted to switch to background
07:51 - one so when you start if there's the
07:53 - background once visible
07:55 - and then i would want my
07:58 - sprite which is my doctor to go back to
08:00 - its original position
08:02 - and then um i will be starting a forever
08:05 - loop
08:07 - um an if statement and then i would say
08:11 - if touching corona virus
08:14 - uh yep then i would want it to go back
08:19 - go to the up a different position
08:23 - so in order to see what the exact
08:24 - position is i'm going to
08:26 - check it out i'm going to see what the
08:30 - position is
08:32 - it seems to be like it's
08:36 - to 12 and negative 163
08:40 - oh yeah
08:44 - 12 and negative 163 i'm going to say
08:48 - so this is going to be go to 12
08:51 - and negative 163
08:55 - and um and i want my background to
08:58 - switch to background too
09:01 - you could you you do not need to switch
09:02 - it but i switched it just for fun
09:05 - so here's our code for um the doctor
09:08 - don't worry if you guys haven't caught
09:09 - up yet i mean i can um i will link the
09:12 - entire game down in the description
09:13 - below
09:14 - so you guys can access it whenever you
09:16 - want
09:17 - then i'm gonna have and i'm gonna write
09:19 - the code for my coronavirus
09:22 - so at the beginning i would want it to
09:24 - be at the position
09:25 - that it is right now um
09:28 - and then i'm gonna say then um i'm gonna
09:32 - say when my backdrop switches
09:34 - which is the second half of the game i
09:36 - would want to move it to a different
09:37 - position
09:38 - so the different position is going to be
09:41 - negative 16
09:43 - and 1 3 8
09:46 - and it's not always the same values guys
09:49 - so
09:50 - you have to adjust it and see you can
09:52 - see it over here
09:53 - x and y um but i've already
09:56 - checked it so i know what the values are
09:59 - um
10:00 - i'm going to say if touching doctor so
10:02 - when karana viruses his doctor
10:05 - i would wanted to switch to
10:08 - backdrop 3 which is my final background
10:10 - to have a message like
10:12 - congratulations and then once the
10:14 - message is displayed i want my entire
10:16 - game to stop so i'm gonna put stop
10:18 - now comes the code for the bomb uh both
10:22 - the bombs are gonna have the same code
10:24 - so the code is very simple you can
10:26 - literally copy paste it so first you do
10:29 - click uh flag and then i want my time to
10:32 - my bomb to be hidden first um so that it
10:35 - appears every 25 seconds
10:37 - then i'm going to start a forever loop
10:39 - which should have
10:40 - which will say first i have to wait for
10:42 - 25 seconds because i want my bomb to
10:44 - appear every 25
10:46 - seconds and then i'm going to say show
10:49 - uh it's very simple
10:52 - and the second half of the code is gonna
10:55 - be when
10:56 - backdrop switches to backdrop two
10:59 - and then i'm just gonna copy and paste
11:02 - the entire code because it's
11:03 - literally that so as you can see my code
11:05 - is already done for the bomb it was
11:07 - simple and sweet
11:08 - i've done it for my other bomb already
11:11 - now i'm gonna do the code for the stars
11:13 - because when
11:14 - when the star is clicked you basically
11:15 - get uh
11:17 - 1000 points extra so i want my star to
11:20 - be seen at all the time so i'm going to
11:22 - say when flag is clicked
11:23 - then i'm going to press show then start
11:26 - a
11:26 - forever loop say forever and then i'm
11:29 - going to say
11:30 - i'll have an if statement and then it's
11:32 - going to be if
11:33 - touching doctor
11:38 - i want to change my uh
11:42 - change my score by 1000 and i would also
11:45 - want to add
11:46 - five seconds to uh my
11:49 - time just to give like a plus factor to
11:53 - the game
11:54 - then um i want it to be hidden
11:57 - after the starts click because then
12:00 - there's no point clicking the start
12:02 - over and over again and then i'm gonna
12:04 - say stop
12:05 - but instead of stop all i'm gonna make
12:07 - it only stop this
12:08 - sprite so now um as you can see the one
12:11 - half of the code is done it's
12:13 - uh the second half is is basically the
12:16 - same all i have to do is make the step
12:17 - back drop two
12:18 - and copy and paste and
12:22 - and whoops sorry guys
12:25 - okay oh my god yeah ah
12:29 - there you go my bad um show
12:32 - and i'm gonna just do it this way so our
12:35 - code for the
12:36 - star is also done i've done the same
12:38 - thing for my second third
12:39 - fourth and fifth star so we don't waste
12:43 - too much time
12:44 - you it's basically the same there's no
12:46 - change at all
12:47 - um now the last code is going to be the
12:50 - code for the maze
12:51 - the code for them is extremely extremely
12:53 - simple
12:54 - so i'm just going to say one flag is
12:56 - quick then i'm going to say switch
12:58 - costume to my
13:01 - second one which is which i've named as
13:03 - b
13:04 - in this case i don't know why but i just
13:06 - named it b
13:07 - and i would want it to
13:11 - go okay i wanted to stay wherever it is
13:14 - or i would want it to go
13:17 - no i would want it to go to whatever
13:19 - position is
13:21 - given over here one second guys i need
13:23 - to what is it sixteen and zero on my
13:25 - back
13:26 - sixteen zero and sixteen oh it's sixteen
13:29 - zero four both
13:31 - okay so i'm gonna let it stay at 16 and
13:33 - zero
13:35 - um and then i'm going to say one
13:38 - backdrop switches
13:40 - up another forever loop followed by
13:44 - switch costume
13:48 - to be and my last code is going to be
13:53 - go to 16 0 so
13:57 - i mean 16 negative 6 so as you guys can
14:00 - see our game is already ready now

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys i hope you guys are doing good during this um tough time of quarantine so i guess you guys are bored by now so i decided to make an another youtube video on um a tutorial for a game on scratch it's a very simple game it's basically the maze game um this game is going to have two stages an easy stage followed by a hard stage i hope you guys enjoy if you have any questions about scratch watch our tutorial video that we've uploaded on youtube or you can dm us on instagram or facebook so let's get right into it so um in this entire game i'm gonna be using five stars two bombs one doctor that's gonna move around and complete the maze and the final uh place to reach is going to be this virus so here's what the doctor looks like all that it has to do is move around and navigate to the final place the current virus by itself is the final destination that the doctor has to reach um these bombs um these are two bombs and um they will appear every 25 seconds and they're just very fun um aspect of the game these stars um they add a thousand points to the entire game just for fun um i also have a mace as one of the sprites so that that the doctor can go through it and um also these are the two three backgrounds that i'm using this is for the first the easy part of the maze um this is for the second part of the mace and this is the final background which has the word congratulations on it um i will be using all of these a lot throughout the game and in my code so um here's just a small introduction about them as you guys can see i've already set up my entire game um i have a maze i have my stars which would give us extra points in the game um i also have bombs which would appear in 25 seconds and i have my uh final uh place to go which is the virus this is basically a doctor going through a virus and um yeah that's the game so i'm going to start coding the game now um my very first step is going to be coding the doctor's movement so i'm going to start by getting one flag is clicked then i would want it to go to the beginning position which is 212 and negative 160 and then i'm going to make a forever loop because we want the movement to keep going and then if um touching if we want down up arrow first so if up arrow is click then we want our y to change by three sorry to change y by three and then we move to the next costume the next costume basically doesn't do much it just stays exactly the same but if you want to like change your customer change the person from like a doctor to maybe say a nurse or something you can do that also now i'm going to change the i'm going to say if touching color black because that's the color of my face if your maze is another color please feel free to put the color that your maze is and i'm going to change y by negative 3 so that it works i'm going to do the same for um all the other keys what i can do is i don't need to redo the whole thing over and over again i can just copy and um copy the entire code and paste it so it just like eases my job i don't have to keep doing it over and over again so i have my forever loop followed by this code and then this i'm going to change my up arrow to down arrow this time change y but i'm going to say negative 3 and i'm going to make this positive three again i'm gonna paste in the other one and i'm gonna put it over here i'm gonna say if now right arrow keys click and then i'm going to this time because it's right and left we want it to be x instead of y so i'm going to say change x by positive 3 and likewise over here i'm going to make it change x by negative three i'm going to delete this and then i'm gonna pull this out copy and paste put this back in put this down make this if left arrow is pressed change the x to negative 3 and change the y to positive 3 so that would move that would uh manage the movement of our doctor to go left right up or down now i'm going to do the movement of um oil controlling our time and score because um that's a fun thing you do not need to necessarily do it but i just wanted to have something fun that's why i did it also for score and time i have basically made my own variables because they didn't have variables of show score and time but if you want you you don't need to necessarily do this but i just did it because i think you can learn something new i'm gonna make the entire game for 60 seconds so um you can it's like a challenge factor to the game i would also want to know the person's name just in case you'd like to see who the who is playing you can adjust your scoring time uh bars then i'm gonna make a forever loop i'm gonna put it over here uh if you have any questions please let us know on instagram we will be more than happy to help you um then i'm gonna also went forever look so uh i would want my time to keep decreasing by one second and then um after it decreases by one second i would want it to wait for a second and then decrease again um then i would add an if statement so and then uh which means that if my time is equal to zero so if my time is up um i'm gonna drag and drop the time over here then i'm gonna say hide my variable time because i don't want it to be seen over there i mean you can skip this step if you want but i like to keep it this way and then i'm going to say stop all because as soon as the time gets over i want my entire game to stop because then there's oh so you cannot continue so the main point of the game is to finish everything before your time is up um next i am going to be doing is uh how do i move to my second stage of the maze so i'm gonna say if my doctor touches the coronavirus on the top i would want it to switch background backdrop because i have two backdrops um to back i want to switch to backdrop two and then uh i would want the first half of the game to stop so i'm going to say stop all uh now for the movement of the doctor to go to the starting position i'm going to say when flag is clicked then i'm going to i would want the background to switch to background too um oh now i wanted to switch to background one so when you start if there's the background once visible and then i would want my sprite which is my doctor to go back to its original position and then um i will be starting a forever loop um an if statement and then i would say if touching corona virus uh yep then i would want it to go back go to the up a different position so in order to see what the exact position is i'm going to check it out i'm going to see what the position is it seems to be like it's to 12 and negative 163 oh yeah 12 and negative 163 i'm going to say so this is going to be go to 12 and negative 163 and um and i want my background to switch to background too you could you you do not need to switch it but i switched it just for fun so here's our code for um the doctor don't worry if you guys haven't caught up yet i mean i can um i will link the entire game down in the description below so you guys can access it whenever you want then i'm gonna have and i'm gonna write the code for my coronavirus so at the beginning i would want it to be at the position that it is right now um and then i'm gonna say then um i'm gonna say when my backdrop switches which is the second half of the game i would want to move it to a different position so the different position is going to be negative 16 and 1 3 8 and it's not always the same values guys so you have to adjust it and see you can see it over here x and y um but i've already checked it so i know what the values are um i'm going to say if touching doctor so when karana viruses his doctor i would wanted to switch to backdrop 3 which is my final background to have a message like congratulations and then once the message is displayed i want my entire game to stop so i'm gonna put stop now comes the code for the bomb uh both the bombs are gonna have the same code so the code is very simple you can literally copy paste it so first you do click uh flag and then i want my time to my bomb to be hidden first um so that it appears every 25 seconds then i'm going to start a forever loop which should have which will say first i have to wait for 25 seconds because i want my bomb to appear every 25 seconds and then i'm going to say show uh it's very simple and the second half of the code is gonna be when backdrop switches to backdrop two and then i'm just gonna copy and paste the entire code because it's literally that so as you can see my code is already done for the bomb it was simple and sweet i've done it for my other bomb already now i'm gonna do the code for the stars because when when the star is clicked you basically get uh 1000 points extra so i want my star to be seen at all the time so i'm going to say when flag is clicked then i'm going to press show then start a forever loop say forever and then i'm going to say i'll have an if statement and then it's going to be if touching doctor i want to change my uh change my score by 1000 and i would also want to add five seconds to uh my time just to give like a plus factor to the game then um i want it to be hidden after the starts click because then there's no point clicking the start over and over again and then i'm gonna say stop but instead of stop all i'm gonna make it only stop this sprite so now um as you can see the one half of the code is done it's uh the second half is is basically the same all i have to do is make the step back drop two and copy and paste and and whoops sorry guys okay oh my god yeah ah there you go my bad um show and i'm gonna just do it this way so our code for the star is also done i've done the same thing for my second third fourth and fifth star so we don't waste too much time you it's basically the same there's no change at all um now the last code is going to be the code for the maze the code for them is extremely extremely simple so i'm just going to say one flag is quick then i'm going to say switch costume to my second one which is which i've named as b in this case i don't know why but i just named it b and i would want it to go okay i wanted to stay wherever it is or i would want it to go no i would want it to go to whatever position is given over here one second guys i need to what is it sixteen and zero on my back sixteen zero and sixteen oh it's sixteen zero four both okay so i'm gonna let it stay at 16 and zero um and then i'm going to say one backdrop switches up another forever loop followed by switch costume to be and my last code is going to be go to 16 0 so i mean 16 negative 6 so as you guys can see our game is already ready now hey thanks for watching and once again my name is riya makaria and leave a like below if you would like to code this amazing game and hit the
