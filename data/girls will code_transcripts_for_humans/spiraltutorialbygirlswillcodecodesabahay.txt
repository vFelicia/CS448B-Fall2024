00:04 - hi guys today i'll be teaching you how
00:05 - to make this spiral
00:07 - and as you can see as the spiral
00:09 - increases the colors are changing and
00:11 - the triangles are increasing
00:18 - hey guys today i'll be teaching you how
00:19 - to make a spiral project on scratch
00:21 - so what you want to do first is choose a
00:23 - sprite you can choose one of the scratch
00:26 - default sprites or you can also choose
00:28 - to make your own for this project i will
00:31 - be using the ball spray
00:34 - so here's my sprite and what i want to
00:36 - do now is decrease the size as much as
00:38 - possible
00:39 - this will allow us to better see our
00:40 - drawing for this project you will need
00:43 - the pen extension
00:44 - to access extensions press this button
00:47 - and click pen this will then give you a
00:51 - series of blocks you can then use to
00:53 - make your project
00:54 - so what you want to do first like every
00:56 - other project is get the when flag is
00:58 - clipped event
01:00 - which will then allow whatever block is
01:01 - split below it
01:03 - to play when this button is hit
01:06 - then you want to get the pen down block
01:08 - and move it here when click event
01:11 - this will allow a line to be drawn
01:13 - wherever your sprite goes
01:15 - so for instance if we move the sprite
01:17 - pen locks to the right a line will be
01:19 - drawn
01:21 - [Music]
01:24 - following
01:26 - for this project you need to start with
01:28 - a basic shape
01:29 - so i will start with a triangle i will
01:32 - do this by moving the sprite a
01:34 - particular number of steps
01:36 - then turning it 120 degrees and
01:38 - repeating this three times
01:49 - [Music]
01:54 - this will then allow me to make my
01:55 - triangle so here's my triangle and what
01:58 - you also want to do is go back to the
02:00 - pen blocks
02:01 - and have the erase all blocked put this
02:03 - at the beginning of your one click
02:05 - function
02:06 - so that you can start with a blank
02:07 - canvas every single time you click
02:13 - in the other triangle what we can now do
02:15 - is create a series of triangles going
02:17 - around in a circle to form our spiral
02:19 - what you want to do is go to the motion
02:21 - blocks and select the pen
02:23 - you can add this to the bottom so that
02:26 - every single time a new triangle is
02:28 - formed it turns 15 degrees
02:30 - to form several triangles you can go to
02:32 - control and have this set of code
02:34 - repeat forever this will make an
02:36 - infinite number of triangles
02:38 - going around in a circle and turning 15
02:40 - degrees every time
02:43 - so as you can see we now have our spiral
02:46 - forming
02:47 - and we'll continue to add triangles
02:48 - until we press the stop
02:52 - [Music]
02:55 - [Applause]
02:56 - so now that you have your basic spiral
02:58 - what you can now do to make it more
02:59 - interesting is customize it
03:01 - you can go to the pen blocks as i have
03:04 - here
03:04 - and you can set the pen color to
03:06 - whatever color you want
03:08 - i will set the pen color to green so as
03:10 - you can see our spiral is now green
03:19 - another thing i can do is have the color
03:22 - change as the spiral is being formed
03:24 - you can get this block called change pen
03:26 - color
03:27 - and have it at the end of your forever
03:30 - at the end of your forever loop
03:32 - and then have the color gradually change
03:35 - as the triangles are being formed
03:37 - so as you can see originally green
03:41 - triangles are now
03:42 - turning into blue and going through all
03:44 - the other colors of the rainbow
03:46 - [Music]
03:47 - another thing we can do to customize our
03:50 - spiral is have the triangles
03:51 - increase as the spiral is being formed
03:54 - this will then create a shell shape
03:58 - so we can do this by going to
04:02 - our variables and creating a variable to
04:05 - replace
04:06 - the number 50 and move 50 steps
04:10 - we can name this variable length since
04:12 - it will be determining the length of the
04:14 - triangle
04:16 - and we can put this in place of 50.
04:19 - now instead of moving 50 steps it will
04:21 - move length steps
04:23 - so we can originally set length to 50
04:27 - then as the triangles are being created
04:29 - we can change the length
04:30 - by one every single time so that the
04:33 - triangles increase
04:34 - as the spiral goes
04:38 - [Music]
04:41 - so as you can see the triangles are now
04:43 - overlapping the other triangles since
04:44 - they're increasing in size
04:46 - thank you for watching and i hope you
04:48 - guys enjoyed the video
04:56 - [Applause]
04:56 - [Music]
05:00 - you

hi guys today i'll be teaching you how to make this spiral and as you can see as the spiral increases the colors are changing and the triangles are increasing hey guys today i'll be teaching you how to make a spiral project on scratch so what you want to do first is choose a sprite you can choose one of the scratch default sprites or you can also choose to make your own for this project i will be using the ball spray so here's my sprite and what i want to do now is decrease the size as much as possible this will allow us to better see our drawing for this project you will need the pen extension to access extensions press this button and click pen this will then give you a series of blocks you can then use to make your project so what you want to do first like every other project is get the when flag is clipped event which will then allow whatever block is split below it to play when this button is hit then you want to get the pen down block and move it here when click event this will allow a line to be drawn wherever your sprite goes so for instance if we move the sprite pen locks to the right a line will be drawn following for this project you need to start with a basic shape so i will start with a triangle i will do this by moving the sprite a particular number of steps then turning it 120 degrees and repeating this three times this will then allow me to make my triangle so here's my triangle and what you also want to do is go back to the pen blocks and have the erase all blocked put this at the beginning of your one click function so that you can start with a blank canvas every single time you click in the other triangle what we can now do is create a series of triangles going around in a circle to form our spiral what you want to do is go to the motion blocks and select the pen you can add this to the bottom so that every single time a new triangle is formed it turns 15 degrees to form several triangles you can go to control and have this set of code repeat forever this will make an infinite number of triangles going around in a circle and turning 15 degrees every time so as you can see we now have our spiral forming and we'll continue to add triangles until we press the stop so now that you have your basic spiral what you can now do to make it more interesting is customize it you can go to the pen blocks as i have here and you can set the pen color to whatever color you want i will set the pen color to green so as you can see our spiral is now green another thing i can do is have the color change as the spiral is being formed you can get this block called change pen color and have it at the end of your forever at the end of your forever loop and then have the color gradually change as the triangles are being formed so as you can see originally green triangles are now turning into blue and going through all the other colors of the rainbow another thing we can do to customize our spiral is have the triangles increase as the spiral is being formed this will then create a shell shape so we can do this by going to our variables and creating a variable to replace the number 50 and move 50 steps we can name this variable length since it will be determining the length of the triangle and we can put this in place of 50. now instead of moving 50 steps it will move length steps so we can originally set length to 50 then as the triangles are being created we can change the length by one every single time so that the triangles increase as the spiral goes so as you can see the triangles are now overlapping the other triangles since they're increasing in size thank you for watching and i hope you guys enjoyed the video you
