00:00 - so today we're going to learn how to
00:02 - make a simple shooting game on scratch
00:03 - which is going to look something like
00:05 - this
00:06 - so i have my player which i can maneuver
00:08 - with my right and left arrow keys and
00:10 - every time i hit the up arrow key
00:12 - i shoot bullets out at my target and
00:15 - every time i
00:15 - managed to hit my target
00:19 - um i get one point and yep so
00:22 - let's learn how to make it
00:25 - okay so i'm on scratch now and i created
00:27 - a new file and i called it simple
00:29 - shooting game
00:30 - and i just changed the background to
00:32 - black as i preferred it but you guys can
00:33 - choose whatever you want
00:35 - and so now i'm going to create a new
00:37 - sprite you can choose a sprite or you
00:39 - can
00:39 - make your own so i decided to paint my
00:41 - own
00:43 - in this case i am choosing the color to
00:46 - be blue
00:48 - and it's going to be a square so this is
00:51 - going to be my player
00:59 - and i'm just going to drag it down so
01:01 - it's like in my preferred location
01:10 - now let's get on to the code so what we
01:13 - want is like whenever we click the right
01:15 - or left arrow key it should move so
01:17 - that's what we're going to program in
01:18 - the player
01:20 - so whenever the green flag is clicked i
01:23 - want to first
01:26 - go to the same position so i'm going to
01:29 - go to same x and go
01:30 - same way because if ever my sprite was
01:33 - moved by accident it will always go back
01:35 - to that position
01:37 - and i'm going to make a new variable and
01:39 - i'm going to call it player speed
01:41 - this is going to determine the speed of
01:42 - the player and how fast it moves
01:44 - as i click for the sprite only so other
01:47 - sprites can't use it
01:52 - and so now i'm setting the player speed
01:55 - to eight
01:56 - and it can be modified later on if it's
01:58 - too fast we can
01:59 - make it go low or if it's too slow we
02:01 - can increase it
02:03 - and i'm just gonna uncheck so it doesn't
02:05 - stay on the board
02:11 - so now this i'm going to put in a
02:13 - forever loop and i'm going to say
02:15 - if the right arrow key was pressed then
02:18 - i want it to move to the right
02:20 - so i'm going to choose if the key right
02:23 - arrow is pressed
02:28 - i want it to move speed steps to
02:32 - so that'll be to the right so let's just
02:34 - test it out
02:38 - okay that's perfect so now i want to do
02:41 - the opposite i want to do if the left
02:42 - arrow keys pressed i want it to move the
02:44 - opposite direction
02:46 - so in this case i'm going to have to
02:47 - multiply the variable which is player
02:50 - speed by
02:51 - negative one so it's going to go in the
02:53 - opposite direction
03:05 - so i'm going to go to operators and i'm
03:08 - going to multiply it by negative 1.
03:13 - and i'm going to drag it on to the moves
03:17 - steps
03:19 - perfect so now if i try it again
03:22 - my player is moving
03:26 - it's also a good idea to name your
03:28 - sprite so i'm naming it player
03:30 - so it's um we'll know what it is later
03:32 - on now i'm going to create a new sprite
03:35 - and this is going to be my target so i
03:37 - want it to be white
03:39 - and it's going to be a rectangle for me
03:41 - you guys can choose whatever shapes you
03:43 - want
03:44 - and like whatever colors you want that's
03:46 - completely up to you
03:52 - and i'm gonna and i'm gonna rename it
03:55 - target so
03:56 - i know what it is later on now let's go
04:00 - on to the code
04:03 - so i wanted to constantly move right and
04:05 - left
04:06 - on the loop so
04:09 - we are first gonna just position it to
04:12 - like the place i want it so i know where
04:14 - it is
04:15 - and then i'm going to go back and say
04:17 - when the green flag is clicked
04:23 - i want it to move
04:26 - but first i wanted to go to that
04:27 - position because in case of if it
04:29 - was moved later on it's easy to go back
04:32 - i'm going to make another variable for
04:34 - this right only and i'm going to name it
04:36 - target speed
04:40 - and i'm going to set that also to eight
04:50 - but if if it could also be changed so it
04:54 - doesn't have to always be eight
04:56 - and now i'm going to say forever
04:59 - if the
05:05 - x locations were ever out of target
05:09 - so if they were ever in the end and went
05:12 - out of the board
05:13 - i want to multiply it by negative one so
05:17 - x position is less than negative 230
05:19 - which is the end of the board
05:24 - or if the x position
05:27 - is greater than 230
05:35 - and so i'm just going to go to the
05:36 - operators and choose the or
05:41 - let's see then i wanted to multiply
05:46 - it by negative one like we did with the
05:48 - player so i'll move in the opposite
05:49 - direction so every time it's in
05:51 - the other side it's going to multiply
05:53 - itself by negative one
06:01 - but besides that it's always going to
06:04 - move
06:05 - so i'm going to go out back i'm going to
06:07 - say move
06:08 - outside the if statement i'm going to
06:10 - say move the target speed step so it's
06:12 - always going to move
06:14 - and if ever it was outside of the
06:15 - boundaries the
06:17 - variable is going to be manipulated it's
06:19 - going to be multiplied by negative 1.
06:21 - so that's good the target is looking
06:23 - good
06:24 - so that's the quote for the target
06:29 - i'm also going to create the another
06:31 - costume for the target and i'm going to
06:33 - make it red
06:34 - because i later on i want that if the
06:37 - bullet were to ever hit the target i
06:39 - want it to become red
06:41 - so i'm gonna just make a new costume as
06:43 - now
06:46 - and when it started just to make sure
06:48 - it's always in the right costume i'm
06:49 - gonna say switch back to costume one
06:51 - which is the white
06:53 - and we're gonna program the red part
06:54 - later
06:59 - now we're gonna create a new sprite and
07:00 - that's gonna be our bullet
07:03 - so every time i hit the up arrow key
07:05 - it's going to turn
07:06 - it bullets are going to shoot out on my
07:09 - player
07:10 - so i want it to be a yellow circle
07:16 - that looks right about the right size
07:21 - and i'm going to rename it bullet
07:29 - i'm gonna go back to events i'm gonna
07:30 - say when the green flag is clicked
07:32 - i want it to hide because i don't want
07:36 - it to show
07:37 - yet so when i click it it's gone already
07:41 - it's hiding i'm gonna go
07:44 - ctrl and i'm gonna say forever
07:48 - if my up arrow or whenever my up arrow
07:50 - is clicked
07:58 - i am going to create a clone of the
08:00 - bullet
08:01 - and when i create a clone that means
08:03 - that i can create have multiple bullets
08:05 - because as of now there's just one
08:06 - bullet if i didn't create a clone
08:08 - and i'm always going to wait until i am
08:11 - not
08:12 - pressing the up arrow because sometimes
08:14 - i can press the up arrow for
08:16 - long a long time and then multiple
08:18 - bullets will shoot out
08:23 - so then i'm going to go back and then
08:24 - i'm going to make a new thing and i'm
08:26 - going to say whenever i start as a clone
08:28 - this is what i'm going to do i'm going
08:30 - to
08:32 - go to not a random position but i'm
08:34 - going to go to the player so i'm going
08:36 - to start off where my player is
08:40 - and i'm going to show myself
08:46 - and i'm going to repeat this until
08:49 - i i am
08:52 - touching my target or i have gone out of
08:55 - the board
08:56 - so i'm gonna say i'm gonna repeat this
08:58 - until i have
08:59 - touched my target or my x position is
09:02 - sorry my white position is greater than
09:05 - the
09:06 - um the length of the board
09:09 - y position is greater than
09:12 - the board which is about 165.
09:17 - and every time it is not touching the
09:20 - target or
09:21 - the y position is greater than 165. i'm
09:23 - going to have it
09:24 - move i'm going to change that's y
09:27 - location by 10 so it's going to move up
09:29 - the board
09:37 - and then i i want to broadcast that
09:39 - whenever it's touching the target i want
09:41 - it to
09:42 - say something so i'm going to say
09:43 - whenever it's touching the target
09:45 - then i'm going to broadcast or like show
09:48 - a message
09:49 - saying that target hit
09:51 - [Applause]
09:56 - so other slides other sprites will know
09:58 - when my target is hit
10:00 - and after it's done with all of that
10:02 - it's going to delete this clone so then
10:04 - i can have multiple bullets
10:07 - so let's test it out if i hit the up
10:08 - character perfect
10:10 - multiple okay perfect so now i want it
10:14 - to actually turn red
10:16 - when i hit it so i'm going to go back to
10:18 - the target and i'm going to say
10:23 - when i receive the target has been hit
10:30 - i'm going to switch back my costume to
10:31 - costume 2 which was the red
10:34 - brick i'm going to say wait for 0.2
10:37 - seconds
10:39 - and i'm going to go back to the white
10:41 - costume which is costing one
10:44 - so it's going to turn red for a brief
10:46 - second so i'm just going to try it out
10:52 - okay there we go so just turned red for
10:55 - that brief moment so i know
10:56 - that it's turned red now let's do
10:59 - something
11:00 - fun let's add a score so let's make a
11:02 - variable
11:03 - name it's score for and i'm going to put
11:07 - it for all sprites
11:10 - and so every time i hit it i want the
11:12 - score to increase by one so
11:14 - at the start the score is always going
11:16 - to be zero and whenever i receive my
11:18 - target hit that means i've
11:20 - touched the target i'm going to change
11:21 - my score by one so it's going to
11:22 - increase by one
11:25 - and once it does that it's gonna just
11:27 - for fun play a sound which is the pop
11:29 - sound
11:31 - i'm gonna have that so i'm gonna
11:36 - try yay so my score increased by one and
11:40 - i heard that pop sound
11:41 - so yeah that's the simple shooting game
11:44 - and now feel free to modify
11:45 - it add levels and other things and even
11:48 - change the colors and
11:49 - all the sprites if you have any
11:52 - questions feel free to reach out and
11:54 - yeah that's pretty much it
11:55 - that's how you make a simple shooting
11:57 - game yay

Cleaned transcript:

so today we're going to learn how to make a simple shooting game on scratch which is going to look something like this so i have my player which i can maneuver with my right and left arrow keys and every time i hit the up arrow key i shoot bullets out at my target and every time i managed to hit my target um i get one point and yep so let's learn how to make it okay so i'm on scratch now and i created a new file and i called it simple shooting game and i just changed the background to black as i preferred it but you guys can choose whatever you want and so now i'm going to create a new sprite you can choose a sprite or you can make your own so i decided to paint my own in this case i am choosing the color to be blue and it's going to be a square so this is going to be my player and i'm just going to drag it down so it's like in my preferred location now let's get on to the code so what we want is like whenever we click the right or left arrow key it should move so that's what we're going to program in the player so whenever the green flag is clicked i want to first go to the same position so i'm going to go to same x and go same way because if ever my sprite was moved by accident it will always go back to that position and i'm going to make a new variable and i'm going to call it player speed this is going to determine the speed of the player and how fast it moves as i click for the sprite only so other sprites can't use it and so now i'm setting the player speed to eight and it can be modified later on if it's too fast we can make it go low or if it's too slow we can increase it and i'm just gonna uncheck so it doesn't stay on the board so now this i'm going to put in a forever loop and i'm going to say if the right arrow key was pressed then i want it to move to the right so i'm going to choose if the key right arrow is pressed i want it to move speed steps to so that'll be to the right so let's just test it out okay that's perfect so now i want to do the opposite i want to do if the left arrow keys pressed i want it to move the opposite direction so in this case i'm going to have to multiply the variable which is player speed by negative one so it's going to go in the opposite direction so i'm going to go to operators and i'm going to multiply it by negative 1. and i'm going to drag it on to the moves steps perfect so now if i try it again my player is moving it's also a good idea to name your sprite so i'm naming it player so it's um we'll know what it is later on now i'm going to create a new sprite and this is going to be my target so i

have to always be eight and now i'm going to say forever if the x locations were ever out of target so if they were ever in the end and went out of the board i want to multiply it by negative one so x position is less than negative 230 which is the end of the board or if the x position is greater than 230 and so i'm just going to go to the operators and choose the or let's see then i wanted to multiply it by negative one like we did with the player so i'll move in the opposite direction so every time it's in the other side it's going to multiply itself by negative one but besides that it's

the boundaries the variable is going to be manipulated it's going to be multiplied by negative 1. so that's good the target is looking good so that's the quote for the target i'm also going to create the another costume for the target and i'm going to make it red because i later on i want that if the bullet were to ever hit the target i want it to become red so i'm gonna just make a new costume as now and when it started just to make sure it's always in the right costume i'm gonna say switch back to costume one which is the white and we're gonna program the red part later now we're gonna create a new sprite and that's gonna be our bullet so every time i hit the up arrow key it's going to turn it bullets are going to shoot out on my player so i want it to be a yellow circle that looks right about the right size and i'm going to rename it bullet i'm gonna go back to events i'm gonna say when the green flag is clicked i want it to hide because i don't want it to show yet so when i click it it's gone already it's hiding i'm gonna go ctrl and i'm gonna say forever if my up arrow or whenever my up arrow is clicked i am going to create a clone of the bullet and when i create a clone that

than the um the length of the board y position is greater than the board which is about 165. and every time it is not touching the target or the y position is greater than 165. i'm going to have it move i'm going to change that's y location by 10 so it's going to move up the board and then i i want to broadcast that whenever it's touching the target i want it to say something so i'm going to say whenever it's touching the target then i'm going to broadcast or like show a message saying that target hit so other slides other sprites will know when my target is hit and after it's done with all of that it's going to delete this clone so then i can have multiple bullets so let's test it out if i hit the up character perfect multiple okay perfect so now i want it to actually turn red when i hit it so i'm going to go back to the target and i'm going to say when i receive the target has been hit i'm going to switch back my costume to costume 2 which was the red brick i'm going to say wait for 0.2 seconds and i'm going to go back to the white costume which is costing one so it's going to turn red for a brief second so i'm just going to try it out okay there we go so just turned red for that brief moment so i know that it's turned red now let's do something fun let's add a score so let's make a variable name it's score for and i'm going to put it for all sprites and so every time i hit it i want the score to increase by one so at the start the score is always going to be zero and whenever i receive my target hit that means i've touched the target i'm going to change my score by one so it's going to increase by one and once it does that it's gonna just for fun play a sound which is the pop sound i'm gonna have that so i'm gonna try yay so my score increased by one and i heard that pop sound so yeah that's the simple shooting game and now feel free to modify it add levels and other things and even change the colors and all the sprites if you have any questions feel free to reach out and yeah that's pretty much it that's how you make a simple shooting game yay
