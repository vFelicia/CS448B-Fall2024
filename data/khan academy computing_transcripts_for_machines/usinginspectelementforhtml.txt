The easy way to do that is to use 'Inspect Element' To do that, you go near the element you're interested in, and you rightclick, click 'Inspect Element', and wait for this thing down here to pop up.

Now this pane contains all the HTML of the page, and I can keep just mousing around and checking out other parts of the page too, and finding out everything that makes up this page. It's pretty darn cool. Also, this is something that you can use on any web page, anywhere on the web. So I encourage you to go out to your favorite webpages, and do a little inspection work. Find out what tags they're made of.
