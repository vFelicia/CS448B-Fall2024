[Voiceover] We're back with our webpage about donuts and the dangers of eating them. I'm really liking the warning class that we added to our p and our strong tags, but I want to make this warning fact stand out even more. It's got that gray border now, from the fact class rule, but I think it'd look better with a big, thick orange border. Let's try adding that to the warning rule, so border 5px solid orange. Oh, I love it, but it's also on the strong tag and it doesn't look so good in line with that text there. I only want it to be on the warning paragraph, not warning text that's in line like that. How could I make a more specific CSS rule? Well, one approach is to make a whole new class warning paragraph and move the properties there, but we don't have to do that. Instead, we can tell the browser to only apply the border properties to paragraph tags that have the warning, but no other tags that have the warning class. To make that rule, we first write the element we're looking for, p, then we write a dot and the class name, warning. That tells the browser to find all p tags that have the class name warning and apply the properties inside, so let's paste this border property in here, and voil√†! We've got the border only on the fact and not on the strong. We can do that with any combination of elements in class names, whenever we want the browser to only style particular tags that have a class. Make sure you follow, exactly, this sequence. The tag name, the dot, and then the class name. If you put a space, accidentally, between the tag name and the dot, it will not work any more. That's because a space means something else in CSS and the browser interprets that rule differently. Stay tuned to find out about that oh, so special space.
