Hi, I'm John Resig. I'm the creator of the jQuery JavaScript Library. I work here at Khan Academy. I created jQuery back in 2005 when I was in college. And here at Khan Academy I work on a number of different things including building the live coding editor that you use here on the website. I hope you really enjoy this course about jQuery. I know I love it and I hope you do too.
