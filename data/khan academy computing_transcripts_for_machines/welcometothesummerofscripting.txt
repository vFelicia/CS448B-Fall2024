Hey, I'm Pamela, and I teach programming for Khan Academy. I teach the second half of the JavaScript course, and all of the HTML and SQL courses. Now, I love teaching programming here, because I get to see all of the creativity that students pour into their programs. I just wake up in the morning and look at all of 'em. And I also just love being around a community of people learning new things. I think it's got this addictive energy to it. Now, when I'm not teaching programming, I'm engineering for Khan Academy, and actually writing a lot of the JavaScript and Python code that powers the programming platform, like the editor and the coding challenges, and the Hot List, so if you find bugs in them, I'll probably be the one fixing them. I'm really excited that you decided to learn JavaScript with us. It'll be hard sometimes, but if you keep at it, you can definitely learn it. I hope that you find what you love about programming during this course.
