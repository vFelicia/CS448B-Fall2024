00:00 - so now we will work on an exercise to
00:02 - create the navigation bar in CSS so
00:05 - basically we are going to follow the
00:07 - below steps in order to complete this
00:09 - practice exercise on creating the
00:12 - navigation bar in CSS so guys you can
00:14 - pause this video and practice on your
00:16 - own using the CSS properties that you
00:18 - have learned so far so first of all we
00:20 - are going to create the unordered list
00:23 - and have the four items as links that is
00:26 - home blog languages and contact so guys
00:29 - let us move to the vs code over here and
00:31 - simply I'm going to remove the previous
00:33 - lines of code that we had written inside
00:35 - the body tag of the HTML file and also
00:38 - we will remove the content of the CSS
00:41 - file over here and then inside the HTML
00:44 - file we are going to have the unordered
00:46 - list with the list item so guys over
00:49 - here as a shortcut you can also use the
00:52 - unordered list that is the UL tag
00:54 - followed by the greater than symbol and
00:57 - Then followed by the lii tag over here
00:59 - guys as you can you can see this is the
01:00 - event abbreviation and when you press
01:02 - enter as you can see you have the
01:04 - starting and the ending unordered list
01:07 - that is the U tag and also the first
01:09 - list item over here with the help of the
01:12 - LI tag and inside this we can Define our
01:15 - list items as well but these list items
01:18 - are going to be links in this case so
01:20 - guys basically we are going to use the a
01:22 - tag over here and for the HF attribute
01:25 - we are going to provide the hash
01:27 - character and inside the aex it is going
01:30 - to be the home tag over here followed by
01:33 - blog languages and contact so guys let
01:35 - us Define that as well simply I'm going
01:37 - to paste this line of code and then over
01:40 - here we will say blog followed by
01:43 - languages and then in the end we we have
01:46 - the contact list item in this case so
01:49 - guys let me just save this file now and
01:50 - try reloading this page on the browser
01:53 - so as you can see we have all the list
01:55 - items in this case and since it is the
01:57 - unordered list we have the bullet over
02:00 - here now guys let us move to another
02:02 - task we need to remove the bullets and
02:04 - the underline from the unordered list
02:07 - item so what we can do is simply we have
02:09 - to provide the CSS properties inside the
02:12 - style. CSS so guys in order to remove
02:14 - the bullets from this unordered list
02:17 - over here you can see these bullets what
02:19 - we can do is we can use the list style
02:21 - type property for the unordered list tag
02:24 - so in this case we say the UL tag over
02:28 - here and simply we are going to provide
02:30 - the list type CSS property and we will
02:33 - say none in this case so guys in order
02:35 - to remove the bullets from the unordered
02:38 - list or the numbers from the ordered
02:40 - list we can Define the list style type
02:43 - equal to none so that there are no
02:45 - bullets or the numbers getting displayed
02:47 - for the list items let me just save this
02:49 - file now and try reloading this page
02:51 - once again on the browser so as you can
02:53 - see there are no bullets right now that
02:55 - are getting displayed now guys what we
02:57 - can do is simply we can remove the
02:59 - underline from these links as well so we
03:02 - will move to style. CSS property and
03:04 - what we can do is we can use the UL tag
03:07 - as the parent tag followed by the space
03:09 - character and then we have the lii tag
03:12 - that is the anchor tag so guys simply we
03:14 - can also use the a tag over here but as
03:17 - your application grows into the complex
03:20 - application we need to be more specific
03:22 - as far as the CSS selectors are
03:24 - concerned so guys over here we are going
03:26 - to use the text decoration property in
03:29 - order to remove the underline from the
03:32 - anchor tags so in this case we are going
03:34 - to use the text decoration property and
03:37 - in this case we are going to use the
03:39 - value as none so guys basically by
03:41 - default we have the underlines for this
03:43 - anchor tag but we can use the text
03:46 - decoration property in order to remove
03:48 - the underline by using the none value
03:50 - for the CSS property so let me just save
03:53 - this file now and try reloading this
03:55 - page once again on the browser so as you
03:57 - can see there is no underline now and we
04:00 - are seeing the pure anchor tags over
04:02 - here without the underline and also it
04:04 - doesn't look like this is the list items
04:07 - inside the unordered list now guys we
04:09 - need to convert this list into the
04:11 - navigation bar over here which is going
04:13 - to have certain background color in this
04:16 - case so guys let us move to another task
04:18 - so as you can see make the items look in
04:21 - line with a black background color so
04:23 - guys what we can do is we need to make
04:25 - these list items look in line over here
04:28 - so simply we are going to inside the
04:30 - style. CSS file and for the list items
04:33 - we are going to have the display
04:35 - property as inline block so guys let us
04:38 - do that as well so inside the unordered
04:40 - list we are going to have the LI tag
04:43 - over here and for this particular CSS
04:46 - selector we are going to say display CSS
04:49 - property and simply we are going to use
04:51 - the inline CSS property so guys
04:53 - basically this is the property that we
04:55 - are going to use in order to make all
04:57 - these list items look in line so that
05:00 - they are displayed on the same line over
05:02 - here so guys let me just save this file
05:04 - now and try reloading this page once
05:06 - again on the browser so as you can see
05:08 - the list items are getting displayed on
05:11 - the same line now and guys we will also
05:13 - have the background color so for the UL
05:16 - that is the unordered list we are going
05:18 - to have the background color over here
05:20 - so guys for the unordered list that is
05:22 - the UL tag we will have the backer so
05:25 - let's say we have the background color
05:27 - and we Define the background color as
05:29 - black in this case and apart from this
05:31 - for the black background color we would
05:33 - want the text color of these links to be
05:36 - displayed as white color so for the a
05:38 - tag for which we have the text
05:40 - decoration as none we will simply say
05:42 - color and this text color we need to set
05:45 - it as white so that it looks more decent
05:48 - on the black color background so guys
05:50 - let me just save this file now and try
05:52 - reloading this page once again on the
05:54 - browser so as you can see we have the
05:56 - black background in this case and then
05:58 - we have the white text color as well now
06:01 - guys we can also have certain padding
06:03 - over here for all the links so that it
06:05 - becomes more readable and also it looks
06:08 - like it is a navigation bar so what we
06:10 - can do is again inside the a tag we are
06:12 - going to have the padding of five pixels
06:15 - so let's say we have the padding of 5
06:18 - pixels in this case let me just save
06:20 - this file now and try reloading this
06:22 - page once again on the browser so as you
06:24 - can see we have the padding as well as 5
06:27 - pixels in this case now guys apart from
06:29 - this you can see there is certain
06:30 - spacing on the left of the home over
06:33 - here and also above the navigation bar
06:36 - and to the left of the navigation bar so
06:38 - guys let us check the main reason behind
06:40 - this spacing and the margins so let us
06:43 - go to the inspect option over here after
06:45 - right clicking and let us check one at a
06:47 - time all the HTML elements so as you can
06:50 - see for the UL tag over here we are
06:52 - getting the margin so the orange color
06:55 - region over here above and below the
06:58 - black color background is displaying the
07:00 - margin of this UL tag so guys if you
07:03 - come over here you can see that we have
07:05 - the margins that are getting displayed
07:07 - by default for this Block Level element
07:09 - so what we can do is for the UL tag
07:12 - simply we are going to set the margin as
07:14 - 0 pixels so in this case we are going to
07:17 - say margin is equal to 0 pixels over
07:20 - here let me just save this file now and
07:22 - try reloading this page once again on
07:24 - the browser so now as you can see there
07:26 - is no margin right now when we hover
07:28 - over this UL tag in this case but guys
07:31 - again we have certain marging over here
07:33 - for the body tag so as you can see on
07:35 - the body tag we are getting the orange
07:38 - color that is getting highlighted which
07:40 - is the margin by default for the body
07:42 - tag that is getting displayed over here
07:44 - you can see that it is the 8 pixels
07:46 - margin so let us remove that as well so
07:49 - before the UL tag it is one of the best
07:52 - practices that you provide the body tag
07:55 - and then you provide the values of
07:57 - margin as 0 pixels and padding as well
08:00 - as 0 pixels over here so guys this is
08:02 - done as one of the best practices in
08:05 - order to remove the default margin and
08:07 - paddings from the body tag so let me
08:09 - just save this file now and try
08:11 - reloading this page once again on the
08:13 - browser so now as you can see we don't
08:15 - have any spacing for the body tag over
08:18 - here as well now guys we can also
08:20 - increase the spacing for the list items
08:22 - over here as far as the top and the
08:24 - bottom spacing is concerned for all
08:26 - these list items so what we can do is
08:29 - inside the LI tag over here for which we
08:31 - have displayed as inline block we can
08:34 - provide the padding tag in this case and
08:37 - let's say we want five pixels of padding
08:39 - over here so let me just save this file
08:41 - now and try reloading this page once
08:43 - again on the browser now as you can see
08:45 - we have the padding that is getting
08:47 - defined for these list items on the top
08:50 - and the bottom as well and guys apart
08:51 - from this let's say we want to come on
08:54 - these particular links that is the home
08:56 - and the blog link and we want certain
08:58 - background color so that the user gets
09:00 - the confirmation that yes this is the
09:03 - link that he or she wants to select so
09:05 - what we can do is specifically for this
09:07 - lii elements over here that is the list
09:10 - items we want to provide the background
09:12 - color but guys it should be on the hover
09:14 - state which means when we get the cursor
09:17 - on that particular list item then the
09:19 - background color should be updated so
09:21 - simply we are going to define the UL tag
09:24 - over here followed by the lii tag and
09:26 - this time we want to use the hover state
09:28 - so in this case we are going to use the
09:30 - colon followed by over state in this
09:33 - case so guys let me use this particular
09:35 - option guys for this state we are going
09:37 - to provide the background color CSS
09:40 - property so let us provide the CSS
09:42 - property and let's say we want the
09:44 - background color to be read when we get
09:46 - the mouse cursor on this particular list
09:49 - item inside the unordered list so guys
09:52 - let me just save this file num and try
09:54 - reloading this page once again on the
09:55 - browser so now if you see when we get
09:58 - the cursor over here the items are
10:00 - getting displayed with the red color
10:02 - background and this is one of the good
10:04 - practices that you can follow based on
10:06 - your requirements whenever you are
10:07 - creating project so guys in this way out
10:10 - of a very simple unordered list that we
10:12 - have defined inside our HTML file we
10:16 - have converted it into one of the
10:18 - attractive navigation Bars by using the
10:21 - style. CSS properties over here for the
10:24 - unordered list and the list items and
10:26 - the anchor tags as well so guys this is
10:29 - is one of the ways that you can use in
10:31 - order to create your own navigation bars
