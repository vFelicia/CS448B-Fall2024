00:00 - so now we will see box shadow in CSS so
00:03 - guys basically the CSS box Shadow
00:05 - property is used to apply one or more
00:08 - Shadows to an element and this we are
00:10 - going to check with the help of examples
00:12 - as well we can specify a horizontal and
00:15 - a vertical Shadow to the Box in which
00:17 - case we can have any of the HTML element
00:20 - have the horizontal and the vertical
00:22 - Shadow so guys over here the default
00:24 - color of the Shadow will be the current
00:27 - text color and as you can see this is
00:29 - the syntax we we have taken the dev HTML
00:31 - element over here and simply we can use
00:34 - the Box Shadow CSS property and provide
00:37 - the horizontal and the vertical Shadow
00:39 - based on our project requirements so
00:41 - guys let us move to the VSS code over
00:43 - here and simply we are going to use the
00:46 - div tag in this case that is going to
00:48 - have the box Shadow over here and then
00:51 - we will say this is a simple diff tag so
00:54 - guys basically we have a very simple
00:56 - statement that is this is a simple diff
00:58 - tag over here let me just save this file
01:01 - now and over here inside the style. CSS
01:04 - file we are going to provide certain CSS
01:06 - properties to this div tag so guys first
01:09 - of all let us provide the width and
01:11 - height of this diff tag over here so
01:13 - let's say we have the width of 100
01:15 - pixels in this case and also the height
01:17 - of 100 pixels and then guys apart from
01:20 - this let us have certain background
01:21 - color for this D tag so let's say we
01:23 - have the yellow color is the background
01:25 - color for this particular HTML element
01:28 - let me just save this file now and try
01:30 - reloading this page on the browser so as
01:32 - you can see we have a simple Square in
01:35 - the form of the diff element over here
01:37 - let us provide certain padding as well
01:39 - so in this case we are going to provide
01:42 - the padding of let's say 10 pixels and
01:44 - also we will provide the border of black
01:46 - color over here so guys let's say we
01:48 - have the Border width of two pixels and
01:51 - the Border style is solid and the color
01:53 - is black color in this case let me just
01:55 - save this file now and try reloading
01:57 - this page so as you can see we have a
01:59 - good good looking div tag over here
02:01 - which is having the background color
02:03 - along with it we have the Border as well
02:05 - now guys how do we use the Box Shadow so
02:07 - over here as we can see the syntax is
02:10 - box Shadow CSS property followed by the
02:12 - horizontal and the vertical shadow that
02:15 - we can provide so guys inside the vs
02:17 - code simply inside the style. CSS file
02:20 - we will say box Shadow CSS property and
02:24 - over here let's say we provide five
02:25 - pixels of horizontal Shadow and five
02:28 - pixels of vertical shadow over here so
02:31 - let me just save this file now and try
02:33 - reloading this page once again on the
02:34 - browser so as you can see the shadow can
02:37 - be displayed over here as far as the 5
02:39 - pixels length is concerned guys what we
02:42 - will do is we will remove the border
02:43 - from this particular original diff tag
02:46 - so that we can see clearly that it is a
02:48 - black color shadow so we are going to
02:50 - Simply comment out this line of code
02:52 - over here let me just save this file now
02:54 - and try reloading this page so as you
02:56 - can see it is a black color shadow right
02:58 - now and the shadow Shadow color will be
03:00 - the text color by default which is black
03:02 - color over here can we change that color
03:05 - so let us try that as well so simply we
03:07 - can set the color as some other color so
03:10 - let's say we provide the color as blue
03:13 - color over here let me just save this
03:14 - file now Ander try reloading this page
03:16 - so as you can see the text color is
03:18 - changed to blue color now and also the
03:20 - text Shadow color is changed to blue
03:23 - color over here now guys apart from this
03:25 - you can also provide the shadow color
03:27 - Inside the Box Shadow CSS proper
03:29 - property so how we can do that simply
03:31 - after the vertical shadow that we have
03:33 - provided we can provide the color of the
03:36 - shadow that you want to show so guys
03:38 - let's say we have the aqua color that we
03:40 - want to display as the Box Shadow over
03:43 - here for this particular diff tag so
03:45 - simply we can provide the color that is
03:47 - aqua let me just save this file now and
03:49 - try reloading this page once again on
03:51 - the browser so as you can see it is a
03:53 - aqua color that is getting displayed
03:55 - over here let us change it to some dark
03:57 - color in this case so let's say we
03:58 - provide a dark blue color as the Box
04:01 - Shadow color for this particular diff
04:03 - tag let me just save this file now and
04:05 - try reloading this page so as you can
04:07 - see we have the dark blue color as the
04:09 - shadow color over here now guys apart
04:11 - from this we can also have the blur
04:13 - effect over here for this particular box
04:15 - Shadow so we have specified the color
04:17 - for the shadow already as the third
04:19 - parameter but the blur effect can be
04:22 - provided after this vertical shadow that
04:24 - we have provided over here so guys after
04:27 - this vertical Shadow and before the
04:29 - color that we have provided simply we
04:31 - can provide the length unit for the blur
04:34 - effect so guys what this will do is
04:36 - instead of having the solid color as you
04:38 - can see this dark blue color is the
04:40 - solid color that you can see right now
04:42 - we will be having certain blur effect
04:44 - for this particular solid color so let
04:46 - us check that as well we have provided
04:48 - the length that is 10 pixels over here
04:51 - let me just save this file now and try
04:53 - reloading this page once again on the
04:54 - browser so as you can see now it is
04:57 - having some blur effect for this
04:59 - particular dark dark blue color and in
05:01 - this way it gives a good look as far as
05:03 - this particular Dev HTML element is
05:05 - concerned guys apart from this you can
05:07 - also design your cards based on your
05:09 - project requirements that you want to
05:11 - display on the website that you are
05:13 - building in this way and it gives a kind
05:16 - of a 3D look over here which means that
05:18 - this particular card is coming up and we
05:20 - can see the shadow behind this
05:22 - particular card in this case so guys
05:24 - this is the way that you can provide the
05:25 - blur effect Inside the Box Shadow over
05:28 - here apart from this we also have
05:29 - something called as spread radius of the
05:32 - Shadow which increases the size of the
05:34 - Shadow so guys let us check that as well
05:37 - so over here instead of having the 10
05:39 - pixels blur effect let us have five
05:41 - pixels of blur effect let us check the
05:42 - changes over here so as you can see this
05:45 - is the five pixels blur effect now guys
05:47 - you can increase the size of this
05:48 - particular Shadow simply by providing
05:51 - another length unit after the blur
05:53 - effect which we call it as the spread
05:55 - radius so guys let us check that as well
05:57 - so if you provide two pixels of spread
05:59 - FL radius let us see how the changes
06:01 - will look like let me just save this
06:03 - file now and try reloading this page
06:05 - once again on the browser so as you can
06:07 - see to some extent the shadow size has
06:10 - been increased for this particular diff
06:12 - tag over here and in this way you can
06:14 - provide the FL radius as well so to
06:16 - summarize first of all we have the
06:18 - horizontal radius and Then followed by
06:20 - the vertical radius and Then followed by
06:22 - the blur effect that we have seen
06:24 - already and Then followed by the spread
06:26 - radius that you want to optionally
06:28 - provide and then apart from that we also
06:31 - have the color that we have displayed
06:33 - over here guys we can provide any other
06:35 - dark color as well so let's say we
06:36 - provide dark green color over here so
06:38 - you will see the dark green color as the
06:41 - Box Shadow for this particular diff tag
06:43 - let me just save this file now and try
06:45 - reloading this page so as you can see we
06:47 - have the dark green color as the shadow
06:49 - for this particular diff tag over here
06:51 - now guys apart from this we also have
06:53 - something called as insert parameter
06:55 - which changes from the outer to the
06:57 - inner Shadow so guys if you not notice
06:59 - over here we are getting the shadow on
07:01 - the right hand side and at the bottom of
07:03 - this particular HTML element what if we
07:06 - want the shadow on the other side that
07:08 - is on the left as well as on the top as
07:10 - well so guys simply we can reverse the
07:13 - Shadow by using the inser value for this
07:15 - particular bag so guys simply we can
07:17 - provide the shadow on the left and the
07:19 - top by using the inser value for this
07:22 - particular CSS property that is box
07:24 - Shadow so after the color simply we can
07:27 - say insert over here and let let me just
07:29 - save this file now and try reloading
07:31 - this page once again on the browser so
07:33 - as you can see now the shadow is getting
07:35 - displayed on the other side of this
07:37 - particular Dev tag so guys in this way
07:39 - you can easily use the inser value as
07:41 - well and apart from this you can also
07:43 - have the multiple Shadows which are
07:45 - separated using comma so guys let us
07:47 - check this as well so I'm going to
07:49 - Simply remove this inset property also
07:51 - we are going to remove the spread radius
07:53 - over here and simply what we are going
07:55 - to do is we will set the Box Shadow as
07:58 - blue color over over here and in this
08:00 - case we are going to increase the blur
08:02 - effect to 20 pixels so guys let me just
08:05 - save this file now and try reloading
08:07 - this page once again on the browser so
08:09 - as you can see we have the blur effect
08:10 - of 20 pixels and the shadow color is
08:13 - blue right now guys we can have more
08:15 - darker version of the blue color so over
08:18 - here we are going to set another color
08:20 - that is dark blue in this case so how we
08:22 - can do that is we can provide comma
08:24 - after this blue color and then provide
08:26 - the horizontal and vertical so let's say
08:29 - this time we don't want to provide the
08:30 - length units for the horizontal and
08:32 - vertical direction for the Shadows but
08:34 - simply we want to provide the blur
08:36 - effect so over here simply we can say
08:38 - five pixels of blur effect and the color
08:40 - that we want is dark blue in this case
08:42 - so guys this is the darker version of
08:44 - the blue color that we have already
08:46 - applied so let us see how the changes
08:48 - looks like so let me just save this file
08:50 - now and try reloading this page once
08:52 - again on the browser so as you can see
08:54 - the dark blue color is also getting
08:56 - highlighted over here as the Box Shadow
08:58 - for this part particular D teag and in
09:00 - this way you can provide your own box
09:02 - Shadow based on your requirements if you
09:04 - want to provide multiple box Shadows for
09:07 - a particular HTML element in this case
