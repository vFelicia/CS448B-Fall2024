00:00 - so now we will see unordered list in
00:02 - HTML so guys HTML unordered list is used
00:06 - to group a set of related items in list
00:09 - and we are going to check this with the
00:11 - help of examples as well now an
00:13 - unordered list starts with the UL tag
00:16 - over here so as you can see we have the
00:19 - less than symbol and Then followed by UL
00:21 - which stands for unordered list and then
00:24 - we have the greater than symbol over
00:25 - here and this is the starting tag of
00:27 - unordered list we have the ending tag as
00:30 - well now each list item starts with the
00:33 - lii tag over here so we have the less
00:36 - than symbol followed by the lii and then
00:38 - greater than symbol in order to define
00:40 - the list item inside the unordered list
00:43 - and then guys the list items will be
00:46 - marked with bullets that is the small
00:48 - black circles by default so guys let us
00:50 - check this with the help of examples now
00:53 - how we can Define the unordered list in
00:55 - the HTML page so guys over here I have
00:58 - defined the title as the unordered list
01:00 - in HTML simply we will have the
01:03 - paragraph inside the body and this
01:05 - paragraph will say that below content is
01:08 - an unordered list so we have defined a
01:10 - very simple paragraph having the
01:12 - statement below content is an unordered
01:15 - list now guys we will use the UL tag
01:17 - over here so when we type UL as you can
01:20 - see vs code is suggesting us this UL tag
01:23 - and we have created the starting tag and
01:25 - the ending tag in this case now guys
01:27 - inside this UL tag we need to Define the
01:30 - list of items so we will be using the LI
01:33 - tag over here so when we use the LI tag
01:36 - it is also having the starting tag and
01:38 - the ending tag over here and inside the
01:41 - lii tag we can Define the name of the
01:44 - item so let's say we Define coffee as
01:46 - one of the items over here and then
01:48 - similarly we will have more items so
01:50 - I'll copy this and paste this over here
01:52 - in the next lines and then let's say we
01:55 - Define another item as tea and then one
01:58 - more item as milk in this case so guys
02:00 - we have three items over here inside the
02:03 - list which is being defined as the
02:05 - unordered list now guys let me just save
02:07 - this file now and try reloading this
02:09 - page on the browser to see how the list
02:12 - items will be displayed so as you can
02:14 - see this is the list items I'll simply
02:16 - zoom in so that you can see the content
02:18 - properly so this is the way that
02:20 - unordered list items are being displayed
02:23 - with the help of the circular bullets
02:25 - over here in black color so guys this is
02:27 - the default appearance of the UN ordered
02:30 - list we can have any number of list
02:32 - items in this unordered list so over
02:35 - here let's say we create more items so
02:38 - we can simply copy and paste these list
02:40 - items in this case and let's say we say
02:42 - Coca-Cola over here is another drink and
02:45 - then let's say we have another list item
02:48 - as Pepsi so let me just save this file
02:50 - now and try reloading this page once
02:52 - again on the browser as you can see now
02:54 - we have five items in this case and all
02:56 - the items are having the prefix in this
02:59 - case it is a circular bullet over here
03:01 - which is defined as the unordered list
03:03 - which is not having any order now guys
03:05 - we can also change this appearance of
03:07 - the bullet in this case so as you can
03:10 - see we can use the list style type over
03:13 - here as the CSS property for the
03:16 - unordered list tag so what we have to do
03:18 - is inside the UL tag we need to define
03:21 - the style attribute so inside the style
03:23 - attribute we can say list style type
03:27 - over here so this is the property that
03:29 - we can use and it is having multiple
03:31 - values that you can see and the disk
03:33 - value is the default value that is being
03:36 - seen right now so what we can do is we
03:38 - can change the value to Circle in this
03:40 - case so when we set the value to Circle
03:43 - it will be a circular appearance instead
03:45 - of a bullet appearance for the unordered
03:47 - list so guys let me just save this file
03:49 - now and try reloading this page on the
03:51 - browser so as you can see small circles
03:54 - are being displayed now for each and
03:56 - every item inside the unordered list and
03:59 - that is the main meaning of the circle
04:00 - value for this list style type another
04:03 - value can be a square value as well so
04:06 - we can have the Square value let me just
04:08 - save this file now and try reloading
04:10 - this page once again on the browser so
04:12 - as you can see we have the squares now
04:15 - that are being displayed for this
04:16 - unordered list items now guys we can
04:19 - also have the nested list as well so
04:21 - let's say we want to describe more items
04:24 - inside this T that is we want to Define
04:26 - black T as well as green te in this case
04:29 - so we can have another unordered list
04:32 - inside this list item so what we have to
04:35 - do is we have to come over here and for
04:37 - this list item that is T in this case we
04:40 - can Define another unordered list by
04:42 - using the UL tag over here and inside
04:44 - the UL tag again we can have the lii tag
04:47 - in order to define the list item so
04:50 - let's say we have black T in this case
04:53 - so we Define black te and then again
04:55 - let's say we have another list item and
04:58 - this time we say green tea so over here
05:00 - we have defined green te in this case
05:03 - let me just save this file now and try
05:05 - reloading this page on the browser to
05:06 - see how it looks so as you can see black
05:09 - te and green tea are being displayed
05:11 - inside this list item that is T with a
05:14 - circular appearance over here so guys in
05:16 - this way we can also have the nested
05:18 - unordered list apart from this this list
05:21 - item can also be an image or a link as
05:24 - well which is pointing to another web
05:26 - page over here so guys you can try those
05:28 - things as well as a homework for you so
05:30 - that you can practice on your own so
