00:00 - so in this video series we are going to
00:02 - cover the JavaScript programming
00:03 - language which is one of the most
00:05 - popular programming language in the
00:07 - world guys we are also going to cover
00:09 - many exercises that you can practice on
00:12 - your own that will help you to
00:15 - understand more about the JavaScript
00:16 - programming language so guys first of
00:18 - all in this video we are going to have a
00:21 - small introduction about JavaScript also
00:23 - we will see how you can install the
00:25 - nodejs which is the server environment
00:28 - where you can write the JavaScript code
00:30 - and run on the backend server and then
00:32 - we are going to see the hello world
00:34 - example in JavaScript so guys basically
00:36 - the JavaScript is the world's most
00:38 - popular programming language and
00:40 - previously it was only used for the
00:42 - frontend development along with the HTML
00:45 - and the CSS but then with the help of
00:47 - the nodejs server environment we can use
00:50 - JavaScript programming language for the
00:52 - backend development as well so guys
00:55 - JavaScript is the programming language
00:56 - of the web so basically whatever Pages
00:59 - you see that is the websites that you
01:01 - see on the internet most of them will be
01:03 - having the JavaScript code as far as the
01:05 - interaction with the website is
01:07 - concerned apart from this it is a must
01:09 - learn language to become a web developer
01:11 - so guys if you want to become a
01:13 - front-end web developer or a backend
01:15 - developer as well JavaScript is the one
01:17 - of the programming language that you
01:19 - should know now guys what is the uses so
01:21 - basically HTML is used to create the web
01:24 - pages that you can see on the websites
01:26 - and then apart from this the CSS for
01:28 - which we have already covered the
01:30 - tutorial series is used to design the
01:33 - web pages so guys basically HTML and CSS
01:36 - will only help you to create and design
01:38 - the web pages if you are new to HTML and
01:41 - CSS first of all you should go through
01:43 - the tutorial series that I have already
01:45 - created for you for both these
01:47 - technologies that is HTML and CSS the
01:50 - link I have given in the description
01:52 - section below and then comes the
01:53 - JavaScript which is used in order to
01:56 - interact with the web pages so guys if
01:58 - you want to add life your web page
02:00 - inside the website then you can use the
02:03 - JavaScript programming language in order
02:05 - to provide the interaction with the web
02:08 - pages that you have already created and
02:10 - designed so guys we will check with the
02:12 - help of examples how JavaScript will
02:14 - work apart from this what is nodejs so
02:17 - for now you only need to know that
02:19 - nodejs is a open-source server
02:22 - environment and basically it is free to
02:24 - use so guys basically you can use the
02:26 - JavaScript code inside the nodejs server
02:29 - and environment in order to achieve some
02:32 - particular task based on your project
02:34 - requirements and then node.js can run on
02:36 - various platforms such as Windows Linux
02:39 - Unix Mac OS and several other platforms
02:42 - and then apart from this nodejs uses
02:44 - JavaScript on the server so guys
02:46 - previously as I have told you JavaScript
02:48 - was used along with the HTML and CSS in
02:51 - order to create the websites as a part
02:53 - of front end web development but guys
02:56 - with the help of the nodejs you can also
02:58 - make use of the Javas script programs as
03:01 - the backend technology as well now guys
03:03 - you can easily install nodejs with the
03:05 - help of this particular link which I
03:06 - have already given in the description
03:08 - section below so this is the nodejs link
03:11 - from where you can download the latest
03:13 - version of the nodejs we will see how
03:15 - you can use the nodejs as well and then
03:18 - apart from this the editor that we are
03:19 - going to use in this video series is vs
03:22 - code over here and to download the vs
03:24 - code you can use this link which I have
03:26 - given in the description section below
03:28 - and this is the page in order to
03:30 - download the vs code now guys let us
03:32 - check the example of how JavaScript
03:34 - works with the help of the console.log
03:37 - and the script tag over here so guys let
03:39 - us move to the vs code in this case and
03:41 - let me just open the folder that I have
03:43 - already created in this case so
03:45 - basically we will make use of this
03:47 - JavaScript folder over here now guys
03:49 - inside this we have the test.js file
03:52 - inside which we can write our own
03:54 - JavaScript code guys before writing any
03:57 - JavaScript code over here let us create
03:59 - the h HTML file inside the JavaScript
04:02 - folder so we have something called as
04:04 - index. HTML file now guys what we will
04:07 - do is simply we are going to create the
04:09 - HTML document template so as you can see
04:12 - we have created the HTML document
04:14 - template over here and for the title
04:16 - part we will say JavaScript tutorial so
04:20 - guys basically we have provided the
04:21 - title as well now what we will do is
04:23 - simply we will provide the diff tag and
04:26 - then we will say Hello World in this
04:28 - case so basically this is a very simple
04:30 - statement that is hello world inside the
04:32 - diff tag let me just save this file now
04:34 - so let me just open this HTML page on
04:37 - the web browser so simply we will copy
04:39 - the path over here and on the browser
04:41 - simply we are going to paste this path
04:43 - so guys this is a very basic HTML page
04:45 - that we have already covered in our HTML
04:48 - video series as well now how do you
04:50 - write the JavaScript code so guys we can
04:53 - simply provide the script tag over here
04:55 - either inside the head tag or inside the
04:58 - body tag so let check how we can do that
05:01 - so simply inside the hate tag first of
05:03 - all as you can see this is the Mt
05:05 - abbreviation when we type the script tag
05:07 - over here simply you can select this m
05:10 - abbreviation over here and then guys as
05:12 - you can see this is the starting tag and
05:14 - the ending tag of the script tag over
05:16 - here inside which we can write the
05:18 - JavaScript code now simply we can write
05:21 - the console.log which is one of the
05:24 - important methods in order to print any
05:27 - string inside the browser consolle
05:29 - section so guys as you can see this is
05:31 - the method that is first of all we have
05:33 - to use the console keyword followed by
05:36 - Dot and then we use the log method over
05:38 - here and then let's say we want to print
05:40 - the name of this YouTube channel so
05:42 - let's say we have programming for
05:45 - beginners which is the name of this
05:47 - YouTube channel which you should
05:48 - definitely subscribe if you have not
05:50 - done so so guys basically this is a very
05:52 - simple statement that is used in order
05:55 - to print this particular string inside
05:57 - the console section of the web browser
06:00 - when you include it inside the script
06:02 - tag over here so when we save this file
06:05 - now and when we reload this page on the
06:07 - browser let me just open the console
06:09 - section first of all so simply we can
06:11 - right click and click on the inspect
06:13 - option over here so it will open the
06:15 - element section inside the browser so as
06:18 - you can see we have the console tab in
06:20 - this case so simply we have to switch
06:22 - over here on the console now guys when
06:24 - we reload the page on which we have
06:26 - included the script tag over here let me
06:29 - just reload it as you can see
06:30 - programming for beginners is now getting
06:32 - printed over here inside the console
06:35 - section of the browser so guys in this
06:37 - way we can easily write a JavaScript
06:39 - code over here inside the script tag
06:42 - which is included inside the head
06:43 - section over here now guys it is very
06:45 - important to note over here that when we
06:47 - provide the script tag inside the head
06:50 - section so basically whatever code we
06:52 - have written inside the body tag it will
06:54 - be delayed by some extent since the
06:57 - script tag will be interpreted first by
06:59 - the the browser so guys it is one of the
07:01 - best practices in order to provide the
07:03 - script tag inside the body tag and at
07:06 - the end of the body over here so simply
07:08 - I'm going to remove the script section
07:11 - from the head tag over here and then
07:13 - after the div tag that we have provided
07:16 - and before the end of the body tag we
07:18 - can simply paste the script tag that is
07:21 - having our JavaScript code so guys this
07:23 - is one of the best practices since
07:25 - whatever elements are to be displayed on
07:28 - the web page those must be interpreted
07:31 - first by the browser and then in the end
07:33 - the JavaScript code must be loaded and
07:36 - then executed so guys this will be one
07:38 - of the best practices in order to
07:40 - provide the better user experience and
07:42 - user must not wait for the HTML elements
07:45 - to be displayed just because our script
07:47 - is loading inside the head tag of the
07:50 - HTML page so whenever you are going to
07:52 - write any of the JavaScript code always
07:54 - remember to have the script tag at the
07:56 - end of the body tag over here so when we
07:59 - say this file now it is going to have
08:01 - the same behavior that is it is going to
08:03 - print this programming for beginners so
08:05 - let me just reload this page once again
08:07 - as you can see we have programming for
08:08 - beginners let me just provide certain
08:10 - more keywords over here so we have
08:13 - programming for beginners YouTube
08:14 - channel in this case let me just save
08:16 - this file now and when we reload this
08:18 - page as you can see we have the
08:20 - statement programming for beginners
08:22 - YouTube channel so guys in this way
08:24 - simply you can provide the console.log
08:26 - statement in order to provide certain
08:29 - string to be printed on the browser now
08:31 - guys with the time you are going to
08:33 - write more and more complex websites so
08:36 - in that case what you have to do is you
08:38 - will have to write multiple lines of
08:40 - code over here as far as the JavaScript
08:42 - code is concerned so in order to
08:44 - maintain the HTML and the JavaScript
08:46 - code properly you can separate this
08:49 - JavaScript code from the HTML code over
08:52 - here so simply I'm going to copy this
08:54 - line that is console.log over here and
08:57 - then inside the test.js as you can see
08:59 - we have created another file over here
09:02 - let me just delete this file and
09:03 - recreate it so that it becomes easy for
09:06 - you as a beginner in order to create the
09:08 - Javascript file so guys let me just add
09:10 - the new file over here and simply we are
09:13 - going to name this file as test and then
09:15 - followed by dot since it is a Javascript
09:18 - file we need to provide the extension
09:20 - that is JS over here so as you can see
09:23 - this is the extension. JS in this case
09:26 - when we press enter as you can see this
09:28 - is the test. as file that is created for
09:31 - us and then simply we have to paste the
09:33 - console.log statement that we had copied
09:36 - from the HTML file and then guys what we
09:38 - have to do is very important thing is we
09:41 - need to link this particular HTML file
09:44 - with the Javascript file over here in
09:46 - order to link it what we can do is
09:49 - simply we can use the script tag over
09:52 - here along with the source attribute as
09:54 - you can see script colon SRC this is the
09:57 - event abbreviation that we must use and
09:59 - when we use the summit abbreviation it
10:02 - provides the SRC attribute as well for
10:04 - which the value must be the path of the
10:07 - Javascript file that we have created so
10:09 - guys basically this is the external
10:11 - Javascript file that we have already
10:13 - created which we have to link it with
10:15 - the HTML file over here so simply since
10:18 - both these files are present in the same
10:20 - directory we can provide the name of the
10:22 - Javascript file that is test.js in this
10:25 - case so guys as you can see this is a
10:27 - very simple statement in order to link
10:30 - the HTML file with the JavaScript file
10:32 - over here when we save this file now
10:35 - again you will not see any change over
10:37 - here the same statement should be
10:38 - printed that is programming for beginers
10:41 - YouTube channel so when we reload this
10:43 - page as you can see there is nothing
10:44 - that is getting printed over here that's
10:46 - because we forgot to save this file that
10:48 - is the Javascript file you can see over
10:50 - here so guys it is very important to
10:51 - save all the files whenever you are
10:53 - writing the code inside the HTML CSS or
10:56 - the JavaScript files so let me just save
10:58 - this file now and when we reload this
11:00 - page once again as you can see
11:02 - programming for beginners YouTube
11:04 - channel is now getting printed over here
11:06 - on the console section of the browser so
11:09 - guys in this way you can write the
11:10 - JavaScript code inside the external
11:12 - Javascript file that we have already
11:14 - created and Link that file with the HTML
11:17 - file with the help of the script tag at
11:20 - the end of the body tag over here now
11:22 - guys apart from this let us also add
11:24 - another statement over here so simply
11:26 - you can type log keyword over here and
11:29 - as you can see log to the console this
11:31 - is one of the important shorthand method
11:33 - that vs code provides you in order to
11:36 - write the code faster so simply you can
11:38 - press enter over here so console.log
11:41 - statement will be printed in this case
11:43 - and then let us say we want to provide
11:45 - the other statement that is Hello World
11:47 - in this case with the exclamation mark
11:49 - So as you can see this is the second
11:50 - statement that must be printed so when
11:52 - we save this file now and try reloading
11:54 - this page once again on the browser you
11:56 - can see that two statements are getting
11:58 - printed over here and it is also
12:00 - providing the line number of the
12:02 - external Javascript file which is
12:04 - helping us in order to print these
12:06 - statements in this case so guys this is
12:08 - as far as the front end development is
12:10 - concerned with the help of the
12:12 - JavaScript code now guys when you are
12:14 - going to copy this file at the back end
12:16 - and you simply want to run this file
12:19 - with the help of the nodejs then how it
12:21 - will work so guys simply what you can do
12:23 - is open Terminal over here on the vs
12:25 - code so this is the keyboard shortcut
12:27 - that is Control Plus back text and then
12:29 - guys what you have to do is go to the
12:31 - directory path where your JS file is
12:34 - present and simply you can provide node
12:36 - followed by space character and then the
12:38 - name of the file that is test JS over
12:40 - here so guys as you can see you make use
12:43 - of this node command in this case in
12:45 - order to run this particular Javascript
12:47 - file so when we press enter over here as
12:49 - you can see the same code that we had
12:52 - written in the JavaScript is now getting
12:54 - printed over here programming for
12:55 - beginners YouTube channel and hello
12:57 - world these are the two statements that
12:59 - we wanted to print so guys this is as
13:01 - far as your backend development is
13:03 - concerned with the help of the node
13:05 - command you can print those statements
13:07 - over here apart from this we are going
13:09 - to learn a lot in the upcoming sessions
13:11 - as well so basically when you are going
13:13 - to learn about the JavaScript
13:14 - programming language either you can
13:16 - integrate it to your existing HTML file
13:19 - and provide the interaction with your
13:21 - web pages or else you can write the
13:23 - backend code as well and run it with the
13:25 - help of the node command over here as we
13:27 - have seen in this case by using the node
13:30 - command followed by the name of the
13:31 - JavaScript file guys it is important to
13:33 - install nodejs over here with the help
13:35 - of this particular Link in order to run
13:38 - this particular command with the node
13:40 - keyword in this case so guys comment in
13:42 - the comment section below whether you
13:43 - have learned something out of this video
13:45 - please make sure that you like this
13:46 - video so that it reaches to more people

13:50 - you get the notifications on upcoming
13:52 - videos as well I'll see you in the next
13:53 - video in which we are going to learn
13:55 - about how to change the HTML content
13:58 - using ja JavaScript so stay tuned
