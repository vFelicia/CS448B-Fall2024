00:00 - so now we are going to complete an
00:01 - exercise on arithmetic operators in
00:04 - JavaScript that we had learned
00:06 - previously so guys you need to follow
00:08 - below steps in order to complete this
00:10 - JavaScript practice exercise over here
00:13 - so first of all we are going to create
00:14 - two variables that is X and Y and assign
00:17 - them the values of 10 and 5 respectively
00:20 - so guys let us move to vs code over here
00:23 - so simply we are going to provide the
00:25 - const keyword followed by the variable
00:27 - name that is X and first of all we will
00:29 - provide the value as 10 for the variable
00:32 - X over here similarly we are going to
00:34 - create another variable that is y in
00:36 - this case and we provide the value as
00:39 - five over here now guys what is the next
00:41 - step we need to print the result of
00:43 - addition of X and Y over here so simply
00:46 - we can have the console. log statement
00:49 - in this case and how do we add two
00:51 - numbers over here since we need to find
00:53 - the result of the addition of X and Y so
00:56 - simply we are going to use back Tex over
00:58 - here and we are going to say addition
01:00 - followed by colon and then over here we
01:03 - are going to provide the dollar symbol
01:05 - after which we are going to provide the
01:08 - curly braces over here now guys inside
01:10 - this you can provide any of the variable
01:12 - names or the Expressions as well so
01:14 - simply we are going to add two numbers
01:17 - that is X and Y by using the plus
01:19 - operator over here so guys basically
01:21 - this is the expression in order to add
01:23 - these two numbers that we have already
01:25 - declared in this case you can also store
01:27 - the result of this particular expression
01:29 - in another variable and use that
01:31 - variable in order to print in this
01:33 - particular console. log statement so
01:36 - guys let me just save this file now and
01:37 - try running this code on the terminal
01:39 - over here so as you can see we are
01:41 - getting the result as addition it is
01:43 - equal to 15 this time that's because
01:46 - when we add two numbers that is 10 and 5
01:48 - we get the result as 15 now guys let us
01:50 - move to the other step that is we want
01:52 - to print the result of subtraction of X
01:55 - and Y so guys over here simply I'm going
01:57 - to copy paste this line of code over
01:59 - here and then we will say subtraction in
02:02 - this case and simply we are going to
02:04 - change the expression to x - y over here
02:08 - let me just save this file now and try
02:09 - running this code once again over here
02:12 - as you can see we are getting addition
02:13 - is 15 and subtraction is 5 that's
02:16 - because x - 5 that is 10 - 5 it is equal
02:20 - to 5 over here now guys let us move to
02:22 - next step we need to find multiplication
02:24 - so let us copy paste this line of code
02:27 - over here once again and this time we
02:29 - are going going to provide
02:30 - multiplication as the string and simply
02:33 - we can say x * y over here when we run
02:37 - this code once again in this case so as
02:39 - you can see we are getting
02:40 - multiplication it is equal to 50 over
02:43 - here because 10 * 5 it is equal to 50
02:46 - now let us move to other step so we have
02:48 - division of X and Y so simply we are
02:51 - going to copy paste this line of code
02:53 - and we will say division over here and
02:55 - this time we will change the operator to
02:58 - divide in this case so X divided by y
03:00 - over here now similarly let us complete
03:03 - the other steps as well before printing
03:05 - all the results so we will find the
03:07 - remainder of X and Y over here when we
03:10 - divide X and Y so simply we are going to
03:13 - say remainder this time and over here we
03:15 - need to use the modulus operator that is
03:18 - the percent operator over here so x% Y
03:21 - which means 10 will be divided by 5 and
03:24 - the remainder will be found in this case
03:26 - now guys apart from this we also want to
03:28 - print the result of the X to the power
03:31 - of Y over here so simply we can use the
03:34 - exponentiation operator in order to find
03:36 - the X raised to the power of Y result so
03:39 - over here we will say exponentiation as
03:42 - the string and in this case instead of
03:44 - using the percent operator we have to
03:46 - use the multiplication operator two
03:49 - times in order to find X ra to the power
03:51 - of Y over here now guys apart from this
03:54 - we also want to print whether the result
03:56 - of X greater than y whether it is true
03:58 - or false so simply we can say x greater
04:02 - than or equal to Y so we provide the
04:04 - statement that is X greater than y
04:08 - question mark So guys basically we will
04:10 - get the result as true or false if x is
04:12 - greater than y over here we will get the
04:15 - result as true and if not then we will
04:17 - get the result as false in this case and
04:19 - then guys lastly we have to find the
04:21 - results of all the above operations when
04:23 - X is equal to 5 and Y is equal to 11 so
04:26 - guys first of all let us print the
04:28 - results of all these operations adds
04:30 - that we have completed so far so when we
04:32 - save this file now and try running this
04:34 - code once again over here as you can see
04:36 - we are getting addition it is equal to
04:38 - 15 since 10 + 5 it is equal to 15 over
04:41 - here then 10 - 5 it is 5 so we are
04:44 - getting the subtraction as 5 in this
04:46 - case and for the multiplication we are
04:48 - getting 10 * 5 which is equal to 50 over
04:51 - here then 10 / 5 we are getting the
04:54 - quotient as 2 and 10 / 5 for the
04:58 - remainder part we are getting 0 that's
05:00 - because 10 is exactly divisible by 5
05:02 - over here and we are not getting any
05:04 - remainder apart from zero in this case
05:07 - and for the next operation we have the
05:09 - exponentiation which means 10 ra to the
05:11 - power of 5 over here so basically 10
05:13 - will be multiplied by the same number
05:15 - that is 10 five times over here and this
05:17 - is the number that we are getting as the
05:19 - output and is X greater than y yes this
05:22 - time because 10 is greater than 5 over
05:25 - here and that is why we are getting the
05:26 - result as true this time now because
05:28 - apart from this we can also find the
05:30 - results for all these operations by
05:32 - simply changing the value of X and Y
05:35 - over here and that is what we are
05:36 - supposed to do this time so CU basically
05:39 - X is equal to 5 and Y is equal to 11 let
05:42 - us see what will be the output over here
05:44 - so when we change the value of x to five
05:47 - this time and Y it must be 11 over here
05:49 - so let me just save this file now and
05:51 - try running this code once again this
05:53 - time so as you can see addition 5 + 11
05:56 - is equal 16 then 5 - 11 it is equal to -
06:00 - 6 5 * 11 is 55 then 5 / 11 is giving us
06:05 - this particular result for the division
06:07 - operator 0.45 then 5 ided 11 the
06:11 - remainder will be 5 over here apart from
06:13 - this for the exponentiation part we are
06:16 - getting this particular result when we
06:18 - calculate 5 ra to the power of 11 over
06:21 - here apart from this is X greater than y
06:23 - no in this case because the value of
06:25 - five is less than the value of 11 for
06:28 - the Y variable over here and that is why
06:30 - we are getting false this time so guys
06:32 - in this way you can complete different
06:34 - arithmetic operators for these two
06:36 - variables for which you have set the
06:37 - values over here now guys what will be
06:39 - the output when we provide the value of
06:42 - x as 4 over here and the value of y as 7
06:46 - over here so guys you can follow all
06:47 - these steps in order to find the answer
06:50 - when the values of X and Y is 4 and 7 so
06:53 - whatever answer you get on the console
