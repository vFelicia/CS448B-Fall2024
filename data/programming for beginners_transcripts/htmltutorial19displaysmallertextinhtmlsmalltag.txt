00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:01 - going to learn about displaying smaller
00:04 - text in HTML using the small tag so guys
00:07 - basically the content of the small
00:10 - starting and the ending tag is displayed
00:13 - one font size smaller than the rest of
00:16 - the text surrounding it so guys
00:18 - basically whatever text we enclose
00:20 - within the small starting and the ending
00:22 - tag will appear smaller compared to the
00:25 - rest of the text so let us check this
00:27 - with the help of the example in the VSS
00:29 - code over here so the very first thing
00:31 - that we will do is we will have a simple
00:33 - paragraph using the P tag and then we
00:35 - will say this text is small in this
00:40 - paragraph So we have a very simple
00:42 - statement that is this text is small in
00:44 - this paragraph in the P tag that is the
00:47 - paragraph now let me just save this file
00:49 - now and try reloading this page over
00:51 - here so when we reload this page as you
00:53 - can see we have a paragraph this text is
00:55 - small in this paragraph now guys what we
00:58 - will do is we will enclose these three
01:00 - words that is text is small in between
01:03 - the small tag so over here in the vs
01:06 - code we have to enclose it in between
01:08 - the small tag so we will have the small
01:11 - starting tag over here and then we have
01:13 - the ending tag as well which we will put
01:16 - after the small word in this case so
01:18 - basically text is small these three
01:20 - words are being enclosed now in between
01:22 - the small starting and the ending tags
01:24 - over here so let me just save this file
01:26 - now and try reloading this page once
01:28 - again to see how it appears so when we
01:31 - reload this page as you can see text is
01:34 - small these three words are appearing
01:36 - one font size smaller compared to the
01:39 - other text in the same paragraph now
01:42 - guys if we see what is happening behind
01:44 - the scenes we can simply right click
01:46 - over here and select the inspect option
01:49 - so after this we have under the elements
01:52 - tab we have this P tag over here inside
01:55 - which we have the this text is small in
01:57 - this paragraph statement and then guys
02:00 - you can see for this small tag we have
02:02 - the font size that is smaller over here
02:04 - so we can also use the CSS property that
02:07 - is font size with the value smaller in
02:10 - order to make the text appear in the
02:13 - same way just like how we have done for
02:15 - the text is Big over here so if we check
02:17 - the code for this text is big in this vs
02:20 - code you can see we have used the span
02:22 - tag and then we have used the style
02:25 - attribute over here for which we have
02:27 - used the property that is font size and
02:29 - the value is larger in this case so guys
02:32 - either we can use this CSS property
02:34 - using the span tag or we can simply use
02:36 - the small tag over here which is
02:38 - supported by the latest version the big
02:40 - tag that we have seen previously is not
02:42 - supported with the latest versions of
02:44 - the browser and that is why we had used
02:46 - the font size property inside the style
02:49 - attribute so guys please make sure that
02:51 - you practice on your own so that on
02:53 - different inputs you get different
02:54 - outputs make sure that you like this
