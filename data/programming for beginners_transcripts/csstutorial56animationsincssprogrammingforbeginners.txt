00:00 - so now we will see animations in CSS so
00:03 - guys basically an animation lets an
00:05 - element gradually change from one style
00:08 - to another style and this we are going
00:10 - to check with the help of examples as
00:12 - well you can change as many CSS
00:14 - properties as you want and as many times
00:17 - you want so guys basically in order to
00:20 - use the CSS animation you must first
00:22 - specify some key frames for the
00:24 - animation so what are these key frames
00:27 - so guys basically the key frames hold
00:29 - what styles the element will have at
00:31 - certain times and the Styles will
00:33 - transition from one particular style to
00:36 - another style for the element that we
00:38 - are going to select so guys let us check
00:39 - the examples of the animation so first
00:42 - of all we will see at theate Key frames
00:44 - keyword that we can use in the CSS file
00:47 - over here so guys let us move to the vs
00:49 - code in this case and let me just remove
00:51 - the previous lines of code that we had
00:53 - written in the HTML and the CSS files
00:56 - over here now guys what we are going to
00:58 - do is simply we will have the div tag
01:00 - over here and we are going to create a
01:02 - square box out of this div tag so guys
01:05 - over here in the style. CSS file simply
01:08 - we are going to provide certain CSS
01:10 - properties to this div tag so let us say
01:12 - we have the width of 100 pixels over
01:15 - here also the height of 100 pixels in
01:17 - this case and let's say we have the
01:19 - background color of aqua over here so
01:21 - guys basically we have a diff tag which
01:23 - is a square box with the background
01:25 - color that is aqua so guys let me just
01:27 - save these files now and let us see how
01:29 - it looks looks like on the web browser
01:31 - so as you can see this is the square box
01:33 - that we have included on our HTML page
01:35 - now guys let us have the Border as well
01:37 - so over here we will have the Border CSS
01:40 - property with two pixels width and the
01:42 - Border type as solid and the Border
01:44 - color will be black in this case so let
01:46 - me just save this file now and try
01:48 - reloading this page so we have the
01:50 - border for this square box over here now
01:52 - guys let us say we want to move the
01:54 - square box from left hand side to
01:56 - somewhere over here at the middle of the
01:58 - screen so how we can do that so guys
02:00 - basically we can use the animation that
02:02 - is with the help of key frames keyword
02:04 - in order to animate the square box and
02:07 - move from one position to another so
02:09 - guys let us check that as well so over
02:11 - here what we have to do is first of all
02:13 - we will have to use the at theate
02:16 - character and then we need to use the
02:18 - key frames over here so guys basically
02:20 - this is the key frames keyword that will
02:22 - be used in order to provide the
02:24 - animations in CSS now guys after this
02:27 - key frame we need to provide certain
02:28 - name to the animation so let us say we
02:30 - provide the animate name over here and
02:33 - then after this inside the curly braces
02:35 - we need to define the animation inside
02:38 - the from and two keywords so guys let us
02:40 - say we want to move from left to right
02:42 - over here so simply we can use the left
02:45 - CSS property in order to mention the
02:48 - position of the box so guys over here
02:50 - first of all we need to define the
02:52 - position equal to relative property so
02:54 - that we can use the left CSS property
02:56 - over here so inside the from keyword we
02:59 - need to first Define the left it is
03:01 - equal to 0 pixels over here and then
03:03 - guys after this we have something called
03:05 - as two keyword so over here we can
03:07 - simply provide the left s 300 pixels so
03:11 - guys basically what exactly is happening
03:12 - over here is the initial position of
03:15 - this particular div should be left equal
03:17 - to 0 pixels and then it should move to
03:20 - the left which must be equal to 300
03:22 - pixels now guys we need to link this
03:24 - animation name that is animate with this
03:27 - diff tag over here so simply I'm going
03:29 - to copy this animate name and then
03:32 - inside the diff tag we need to use the
03:34 - animation name CSS property so guys
03:36 - basically we need to provide the
03:38 - animation name CSS property the value
03:40 - must be equal to the value that we have
03:43 - provided for this key frames over here
03:45 - so we have provided the animate as the
03:47 - value for the animation name and apart
03:50 - from this we also have to set the
03:51 - animation duration over here so let's
03:54 - say we want to move this box within 2
03:56 - seconds so simply we can provide the
03:58 - value as 2 seconds over here so let me
04:00 - just save this file now and try
04:02 - reloading this page once again on the
04:04 - browser so when we reload as you can see
04:07 - the box is moving from left to right
04:09 - over here so guys in this way we can
04:11 - simply provide certain animations that
04:13 - we have seen over here with the help of
04:15 - the key frames keyword now guys apart
04:17 - from this you can also use the
04:19 - percentages instead of from and to
04:22 - keyword which is the starting and the
04:24 - ending position so instead of from we
04:26 - can provide 0% which is the starting
04:28 - position and instead of of two keyword
04:30 - we can provide 100% that is the ending
04:33 - position of the box over here so let me
04:35 - just save this file now and try
04:37 - reloading this page once again on the
04:39 - browser so as you can see there is no
04:41 - change in the animation the box is still
04:43 - moving from left to right over here now
04:46 - guys apart from this since we have
04:47 - provided the percentages we can also
04:50 - provide the 50% or any other number that
04:53 - we want to provide so let's say for the
04:55 - first 50% we want to move from left to
04:58 - right over here so we have provided 50%
05:01 - in this case and then we want to define
05:04 - the 100% as well in which case we want
05:06 - to move the box from top to bottom over
05:09 - here somewhere at the center of the
05:10 - screen so guys what we will do is
05:12 - instead of 50% over here we will provide
05:15 - 100% so from 0 to 50% the box is moving
05:18 - from left to right and then for the 100%
05:21 - we want the top CSS property to be
05:24 - provided so guys over here simply we can
05:26 - provide the top CSS property and let's
05:28 - say we want 200 pixels value from the
05:31 - top so let me just save this file now
05:33 - and try reloading this page once again
05:35 - on the browser so as you can see the box
05:37 - is coming from left to right but guys it
05:39 - is not going from top to bottom properly
05:42 - so let us Define the top property for
05:44 - the 0% and the 50% parameters as well so
05:48 - over here the top CSS property must be
05:50 - zero and for the 50% as well the top CSS
05:54 - property must be zero in this case now
05:56 - let me just save this file now and try
05:58 - reloading this page once again on the
06:00 - browser so as you can see the box is now
06:02 - moving from left to right and then it is
06:05 - going from top to bottom over here so
06:07 - guys in this way we have completed this
06:09 - particular animation as well let us
06:11 - complete the entire cycle let's say now
06:14 - we want the box to move from left to
06:16 - right and then from right to bottom and
06:18 - then from bottom back to the original
06:21 - position over here so guys what we have
06:22 - to do is we need to make this as 33%
06:26 - over here and then the next step will be
06:28 - 66% and then the last step should be
06:30 - 100% in this case for which the Box
06:33 - should come at the original position
06:34 - over here so guys simply we will Define
06:37 - this particular position for the 100% as
06:39 - well so I'm going to copy this same line
06:42 - of code over here let me just save this
06:44 - file now and try reloading this page
06:45 - once again on the browser as you can see
06:48 - it is coming from left to right and then
06:50 - going from top to bottom and then from
06:52 - bottom to top as well at the top left
06:55 - position over here so guys in this way
06:57 - we have completed the animation we can
06:59 - also increase the duration to let's say
07:01 - 4 seconds over here so that the speed of
07:03 - the animation is little bit slow so as
07:06 - you can see this is the animation that
07:08 - you can do with the help of the key
07:10 - frames keyword over here now guys there
07:12 - are some more CSS properties that you
07:14 - can use we have already used the
07:15 - animation name and the animation
07:17 - duration over here we can also provide
07:19 - the animation delay in this case so guys
07:22 - basically what is the mining of
07:23 - Animation delay over here so let us
07:26 - check that as well so when we provide
07:28 - the animation delay of let's say 2
07:30 - seconds so there will be a delay of 2
07:32 - seconds first of all after which the
07:34 - animation will start based on the CSS
07:37 - properties that we have defined inside
07:39 - this particular block of code so guys
07:41 - let me just save this file now and try
07:43 - reloading this page once again on the
07:45 - browser so as you can see there will be
07:47 - delay of 2 seconds after which the box
07:49 - has started to move over here so guys in
07:51 - this way you can use the animation delay
07:53 - as well apart from this we also have the
07:55 - animation iteration count which will
07:57 - help us in order to rep delete the
07:59 - animation so guys by default the
08:01 - animation iteration is just one count
08:04 - over here so we can make it as two count
08:06 - as well so the animation will occur
08:09 - twice so let me just save this file now
08:11 - and try reloading this page once again
08:13 - on the browser over here so as you can
08:15 - see after the delay the animation has
08:17 - started so it has completed one round
08:19 - over here but since we have given the
08:21 - count of two it is completing the two
08:23 - rounds over here after which it will
08:25 - stop itself so guys basically you can
08:27 - also use the iteration count as infinite
08:30 - in order to continue the animation on
08:33 - the web browser let us comment out the
08:36 - delay part over here so that we can
08:38 - instantly see the animation in action so
08:40 - let me just save this file now and try
08:42 - reloading this page so as you can see
08:44 - the animation has started and it will
08:46 - continue infinitely until and unless you
08:49 - close the page or you want to change the
08:51 - animation iteration count CSS property
08:54 - so guys in this way you can use the
08:56 - animation iteration count as well apart
08:58 - from this we also have animation
09:00 - Direction so guys basically this is the
09:03 - default direction that the box is moving
09:05 - over here so guys we can also Define the
09:07 - direction of the animation so let's say
09:10 - we provide the animation Direction in
09:12 - this case now guys what are the values
09:14 - the normal is the default value over
09:16 - here but when we provide the reverse
09:18 - value the animation will be in the
09:20 - reverse Direction so let me just provide
09:22 - the reverse Direction over here and let
09:24 - me just save this file now and try
09:26 - reloading this page once again on the
09:27 - browser so as you can see animation is
09:29 - in Reverse Direction now first it is
09:31 - moving over here at the bottom Direction
09:34 - and then to the top over here and then
09:36 - followed by to the left Direction in
09:38 - this case which is the reverse Direction
09:40 - over here apart from this we also have
09:42 - the alternate value as well so first it
09:44 - will go in the normal Direction and then
09:46 - in the second iteration the Box will
09:48 - move to the reverse Direction and Then
09:50 - followed by the normal Direction and
09:52 - then reverse Direction and so on the
09:54 - alternate directions will be used so
09:56 - guys let me just save this file now and
09:58 - try reloading this page once again on
10:00 - the browser so this is the normal
10:01 - direction of the box that is moving and
10:04 - then it is moving in the reverse
10:05 - Direction right now based on the
10:07 - animation direction that we have
10:09 - provided over here with the value as
10:11 - alternate now guys apart from this we
10:13 - also have something called as animation
10:15 - timing function so guys let us check
10:17 - that as well so basically it will Define
10:20 - the speed of the box that is moving over
10:22 - here so guys we can use this animation
10:25 - timing function over here and by default
10:28 - and we can provide the speed as linear
10:30 - in this case which means the speed will
10:32 - be same throughout the animation so let
10:34 - me just save this file now if you notice
10:36 - currently the speed is decreasing when
10:39 - it is moving towards the end of the
10:41 - animation over here but when we provide
10:43 - the linear timing function over here the
10:45 - speed will be same throughout the
10:47 - animation so let me just reload this
10:49 - page once again so as you can see the
10:51 - speed is linear over here and it is not
10:53 - increasing or decreasing at the end or
10:56 - at the start of the animation so Guys
10:58 - these are some of the animation CSS
11:00 - properties that you can use apart from
11:03 - this we also have something called as
11:04 - animation field mode which can help us
11:07 - in order to define the status at the
11:10 - start or at the end of the animation so
11:12 - guys I'll leave the CSS property as a
11:14 - homework for you so that you can
11:15 - practice on your own we can also
11:17 - decrease the line of code over here
11:19 - since a 0% and the 100% is having the
11:22 - same CSS properties and the values as
11:24 - well so simply I'm going to remove this
11:27 - 100% from here and then we will provide
11:29 - comma after the 0% and provide 100% in
11:32 - this case which means the 0% and the
11:35 - 100% state is going to have the same
11:38 - value over here let me just provide the
11:40 - animation direction as normal in this
11:42 - case so let me just save this file now
11:44 - and try reloading this page so as you
11:46 - can see this is the original animation
11:49 - that we have provided and with 0% and
11:51 - 100% that is having the same CSS
11:54 - properties over here now guys apart from
11:56 - this while this box is moving we can
11:58 - change the background color of the box
12:00 - as well so let's say initially we have
12:02 - the background color as aqua color over
12:04 - here and then at the 33% State we want
12:08 - the color to be blue color so simply we
12:10 - will provide the background color as
12:12 - blue color over here at the 33% State
12:15 - and then for the 66% State let's say we
12:18 - have the color as yellow over here so
12:20 - guys basically we are changing the
12:21 - background colors as well as the box is
12:23 - moving based on the different status of
12:26 - the animations so let me just save this
12:28 - file now andent by reloading this page
12:30 - once again on the browser so as you can
12:32 - see from Aqua the box is changing its
12:34 - color to blue color and then when the
12:36 - box is moving down the color is changed
12:38 - to yellow color over here so guys in
12:40 - this way we can change the background
12:42 - color or any other CSS properties based
12:44 - on your requirements while you are
12:46 - providing the animations in CSS so guys
