00:00 - so now we will see input type month in
00:02 - HTML form so guys basically the input
00:05 - tag along with the type month allows the
00:08 - user to select a month and a year and
00:11 - this we are going to check with the help
00:13 - of examples as well now depending on the
00:15 - browser support a date picker can show
00:18 - up in the input field and we are going
00:20 - to select one of the months and the year
00:23 - as well it is very important to note
00:25 - that the type month is not supported in
00:27 - Firefox Safari and Internet Explorer Lev
00:31 - so let us move to the vs code over here
00:33 - and previously we had seen the input tag
00:36 - along with the type file and the type
00:38 - hidden as well now after this hidden
00:40 - input tag we are going to have another
00:42 - input with the type month over here so
00:45 - input colon month as you can see this is
00:47 - the Mt abbreviation over here which is a
00:50 - special feature of the vs code that
00:52 - allows us in order to have the required
00:54 - attributes inside the input tag so guys
00:57 - over here we have the type as month that
00:59 - is set and then let's say we provide the
01:01 - name as month over here and the same
01:04 - value we provided to the ID attribute as
01:06 - well now before this we are also going
01:08 - to have the label and for the four
01:10 - attribute we are going to have the ID as
01:13 - month over here that's because when the
01:15 - user clicks on this particular label you
01:18 - will be seeing the month picker over
01:20 - here that will be displayed to the user
01:22 - in order to select one of the month and
01:24 - the year so guys over here we will say
01:27 - select a month in this case as the label
01:30 - and then after this input tag we are
01:31 - going to have couple of line braks over
01:33 - here so that the submit button is showed
01:35 - on the next line now let me just save
01:37 - this file now and try reloading this
01:39 - page on the browser so as you can see
01:41 - select a month label is being displayed
01:43 - over here and then user can click on
01:46 - this particular label or you can also
01:48 - click on this icon over here in order to
01:51 - display the month and the years as well
01:53 - so when we click on the label as well so
01:55 - as you can see over here you can select
01:57 - one of the months in this case so let's
01:59 - say say we go back to 2022 and then the
02:02 - month of April we want to select so when
02:05 - we select April 2022 it is being
02:07 - displayed over here and when the user
02:09 - clicks on submit button input field will
02:12 - be passed via the URL to the server
02:15 - that's because we have provided the
02:17 - method value as get request over here
02:20 - inside the form tag so guys let us
02:21 - submit this form over here so as you can
02:23 - see the month field is having the value
02:26 - as 2022 and the month that is 04 being
02:30 - displayed over here which is being
02:31 - passed to the server and guys this is
02:34 - the way that we can have the input field
02:36 - with the type month that will allow the
02:38 - user to select one of the months over
02:40 - here the past month or the future months
02:42 - can also be selected in this case so
