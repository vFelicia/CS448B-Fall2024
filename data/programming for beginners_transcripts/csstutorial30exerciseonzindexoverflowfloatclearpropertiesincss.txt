00:00 - so now let us work on this exercise on
00:02 - Zed index overflow float and the clear
00:05 - properties in CSS so guys you can pause
00:07 - this video and practice on your own and
00:10 - complete all these task in this
00:11 - particular exercise so that you get the
00:14 - better understanding on all these CSS
00:16 - properties so we are going to follow the
00:18 - below steps to complete the practice
00:20 - exercise first of all we will create the
00:22 - two div elements that is div 1 and div 2
00:25 - IDs with the background colors and some
00:27 - padding so guys let us move to the vs
00:29 - code over here so simply I'm going to
00:31 - remove the previous lines of code that
00:33 - we had written in the HTML and the CSS
00:36 - files over here and simply we are going
00:38 - to create the two div elements with the
00:41 - ID div 1 and div 2 so guys over here we
00:44 - have the div 1 and we are going to
00:46 - provide the text that is div one over
00:48 - here and similarly we will have the ID
00:51 - with the div 2 for another div tag and
00:53 - we will say that the text is div 2 in
00:56 - this case and after this we are going to
00:58 - move to the style. CSS file file over
01:00 - here simply we are going to provide the
01:02 - ID that is div 1 by providing the hash
01:05 - character followed by the ID that is div
01:07 - 1 over here we will provide the
01:09 - background color so let's say we have
01:11 - the background color as yellow and guys
01:13 - for all the div tag we want the padding
01:16 - so let's say we simply provide the diff
01:18 - tag over here and inside the curly
01:20 - braces we will have the padding of 5
01:23 - pixels in this case so guys basically
01:25 - this padding of five pixels will be
01:27 - applied to all the diff tags over here
01:29 - and and the background colors will be
01:31 - separately applied based on the ID of
01:34 - the div tag so over here we have the
01:36 - second div that is div two over here and
01:39 - then again we will have the background
01:40 - color and let's say we have the
01:42 - background color of aqua let me just
01:44 - save this file now and try reloading
01:46 - this page on the browser so as you can
01:48 - see we have div 1 and div 2 getting
01:50 - displayed on the web page now guys let
01:52 - us move to another task over here we
01:54 - have position the div 2 above div 1 with
01:57 - relative position and applying left and
02:00 - bottom properties so guys basically we
02:02 - have to move the second div above the
02:04 - first div over here by using the
02:06 - relative position so guys what we can do
02:08 - is for this diff 2 we will set the
02:11 - position as relative this time so over
02:13 - here we say position is equal to
02:15 - relative and we will say left it is
02:18 - equal to 20 pixels so guys basically we
02:20 - want certain spacing from the left and
02:23 - the bottom as well so that this second
02:25 - div element can be displayed on top of
02:28 - this first div element over here so
02:30 - let's say we provide the left property
02:32 - with the spacing of 30 pixels so we say
02:35 - 30 pixels and from the bottom as well we
02:38 - provide some spacing so let's say 20
02:40 - pixels of spacing is provided over here
02:42 - from the bottom let me just save this
02:44 - file now and try reloading this page
02:46 - once again on the browser so as you can
02:48 - see we have the div 1 now getting
02:50 - displayed behind this particular div 2
02:53 - element so guys this happened because
02:55 - from the normal position of the div 2 we
02:57 - have slightly moved it or positioned it
03:00 - from the left and the bottom with these
03:02 - numbers that we have specified in the
03:04 - CSS file over here and apart from this
03:07 - since we have defined the second element
03:09 - after the first element and that is the
03:11 - reason why div 2 is getting displayed on
03:14 - top of the div 1 so guys we have
03:16 - completed the second task as well that
03:18 - is position the div two above div 1 with
03:21 - relative position and applying left and
03:23 - bottom properties now guys we need to
03:25 - get the div 1 above div 2 using the Z
03:29 - index proper so guys over here what we
03:31 - have to do is at the same position we
03:33 - want to display div 1 on top of this
03:36 - particular div 2 so what we can do is
03:38 - simply inside the style. CSS file for
03:41 - this div 1 we can provide the Z index
03:44 - property so over here when we provide
03:46 - the Zed index by default The Zed index
03:48 - of div 2 is zero so we want to provide a
03:51 - number that is greater than zero for
03:53 - this Zed index of the first div element
03:55 - so over here we will provide the Z index
03:58 - of one let me just save this file and
03:59 - now and try reloading this page once
04:01 - again on the browser so as you can see
04:03 - there is no change right now we were
04:05 - expecting that div 1 should come on top
04:07 - of div 2 so guys why there is no change
04:09 - because we have not provided the
04:11 - position property for the first div so
04:13 - guys Z index property will not work for
04:16 - the position is equal to static value
04:18 - which is the default value for the
04:20 - position attribute and by default the
04:22 - position value is now having the static
04:25 - value for this first development so
04:27 - simply we can say position is equal to
04:29 - to relative this time so that we are
04:32 - positioning this particular first div
04:34 - element as well let me just save this
04:36 - file now and try reloading this page
04:38 - once again on the browser now to see
04:39 - whether the Zed index is effective this
04:41 - time so when we reload this page as you
04:44 - can see div one with the yellow
04:45 - background color is now getting
04:47 - displayed on top of the diff to which
04:49 - has now gone behind over here so guys
04:52 - let us reduce certain spacing from the
04:54 - bottom for the div 2 element so that we
04:56 - can see certain text over here for the
04:58 - second div element so let's say we
05:00 - provide the 12 pixel spacing from the
05:02 - bottom let me just save this file now
05:04 - and try reloading this page so as you
05:06 - can see div 2 is still getting displayed
05:08 - behind of this particular div one
05:11 - element so guys in this way we have used
05:13 - the Zed index property always remember
05:15 - that it should have the position
05:17 - property as well whenever you are using
05:19 - the Z index property and the value of
05:21 - the position property should be anything
05:24 - other than static value now guys apart
05:26 - from this let us create div 3 with 40%
05:29 - WID and 100 pixels height with random
05:31 - text that will overflow so guys let us
05:34 - check this as well so over here after
05:36 - the second D let us create another div
05:38 - over here with div 3 ID and let's say we
05:41 - create some generate text over here by
05:43 - using the lurm M abbreviation so over
05:46 - here we have generated certain random
05:48 - text so let me just save this file now
05:50 - and try reloading this page once again
05:51 - on the browser so as you can see we have
05:53 - another div element over here now guys
05:56 - in the same task we want this div
05:58 - element to be having the width of 40%
06:00 - and height of 100 pixels so let us set
06:03 - that as well so inside the style. CSS
06:05 - file we will say d three which is the ID
06:08 - of this third div element and for this
06:11 - third div we want the width of 40% this
06:14 - time as per the task over here so we
06:16 - have the width of 40% and height is 100
06:18 - pixels so over here we will say height
06:21 - it is equal to 100 pixels this time and
06:24 - apart from this the random text Will
06:26 - overflow so guys we will also have the
06:28 - background color so Let's see we have
06:30 - the background color of coral value over
06:32 - here so let me just save this file now
06:34 - and try reloading this page once again
06:36 - on the browser so as you can see we have
06:38 - the 40% width for this third div element
06:41 - and the height of 100 pixel but guys by
06:44 - default we have the Overflow value as
06:46 - visible this time so basically the text
06:48 - is going outside of this container so
06:51 - guys we have completed the task but the
06:53 - text is still going outside of this
06:55 - particular container that is the diff
06:57 - tag so what we will do is we will move
06:59 - to the the other task that is use the
07:01 - Overflow property to create scroll bar
07:04 - for this diff 3 element so guys what we
07:06 - will do is since this particular text is
07:09 - going outside of the container simply we
07:11 - can use the Overflow property and have
07:13 - the scroll bar on this particular
07:15 - container so that entire text is limited
07:18 - to be displayed within this particular
07:20 - container so guys let us provide this
07:22 - overflow property over here inside the
07:24 - style. CSS file so over here we will say
07:28 - overflow property and this time we will
07:30 - say scroll over here so basically a
07:33 - horizontal scroll bar will be displayed
07:35 - we can also use the value of Auto over
07:37 - here for the Overflow property let me
07:39 - just save this file now and try
07:41 - reloading this page once again on the
07:43 - browser as you can see we have the
07:44 - vertical scroll bar over here and this
07:46 - is the way that we can use the Overflow
07:48 - property in order to make the extra text
07:51 - fit inside the container that is having
07:53 - the limited width and height over here
07:56 - now guys apart from this let us move to
07:57 - the other task that is to create create
07:59 - the diff four and five that should float
08:02 - left and right respectively so guys what
08:04 - we will do is we will create more two
08:07 - diff tags over here inside the HTML file
08:10 - so after this div 3 we will have div
08:12 - four so let's create the fourth div with
08:15 - the ID div 4 over here and we will say
08:17 - div 4 this time and again we will create
08:20 - another div with the ID that is div 5
08:23 - over here so we have created diff 4 and
08:25 - div 5 as well we will also apply the
08:27 - background colors for this diff four and
08:29 - D five so let us do that as well so we
08:31 - say d four with the background color so
08:34 - let's provide some background color over
08:36 - here so we will provide the color as
08:38 - yellow green and for D five as well we
08:40 - will provide some other color this time
08:42 - so guys over here we use the background
08:45 - color and let me just see what can be
08:47 - the value so we will use some light
08:49 - value over here so let's say we use this
08:51 - particular color for the background
08:53 - color let me just save this file now and
08:55 - try reloading this page once again on
08:57 - the browser so as you can see we have
08:58 - both both the divs that are getting
09:00 - displayed but guys we want both these
09:02 - divs to be displayed on the left and on
09:05 - the right respectively by using the
09:07 - float property over here so both the div
09:09 - should float on the left and the right
09:12 - side of the screen so guys what we can
09:13 - do is simply we can provide the float
09:16 - property for the div Four Element so
09:18 - over here we will say float it is equal
09:20 - to left and for the div Five Element we
09:22 - can say float it is equal to right this
09:25 - time let me just save this file now and
09:27 - try reloading this page once again on
09:29 - the browser so as you can see we have
09:31 - div four on the left and div five on the
09:34 - right and that is how we can use the
09:35 - float property in order to make the HTML
09:38 - elements position on any side of the
09:41 - screen on the left or the right of the
09:43 - screen now guys let us move to another
09:44 - task we will create another div that is
09:47 - div 6 that should be displayed below div
09:49 - 4 and div 5 so let us create another
09:52 - diff tag over here so basically we are
09:54 - going to create another diff tag for
09:56 - which the ID should be six this time and
09:59 - and the value will be D 6 over here let
10:02 - us see how this will be displayed by
10:03 - default without providing any position
10:06 - so in the style. CSS simply we are going
10:08 - to provide the background color for this
10:10 - sixth div element so over here we will
10:13 - say div six and then let's say we
10:15 - provide the background color and we will
10:17 - use this particular color over here as
10:19 - the background color this time let me
10:21 - just save this file now and try
10:23 - reloading this page once again on the
10:24 - browser so as you can see diff 6 element
10:27 - by default is getting displayed to the
10:30 - right of diff 4 and to the left of diff
10:32 - 5 but guys based on our task we want to
10:35 - display the diff 6 below the diff 4 and
10:37 - the diff 5 Element so how this can be
10:39 - done we can use the clear property since
10:42 - we have already used the float property
10:44 - for the diff four and div five so since
10:46 - the div 6 element is the next element to
10:49 - the div four and div five elements we
10:51 - need to use the clear property over here
10:54 - in order to get this sixth div element
10:56 - on the next line so guys what we can do
10:59 - is simply we will say clear and then we
11:01 - will have the value as both so let me
11:04 - just save this file now and try
11:05 - reloading this page once again on the
11:07 - browser so now as you can see diff 6 is
11:10 - getting displayed below this diff 4 and
11:12 - diff 5 respectively and this is how we
11:15 - can use the float and clear properties
11:17 - as well if we provide the left value
11:19 - over here let us check what will happen
11:21 - so when we save this file now and try
11:23 - reloading this page so there is no
11:25 - change right now and with the value that
11:27 - is right as well probably there will be
11:29 - no change over here so guys basically
11:31 - the important thing is to make use of
11:33 - this clear property after we have used
11:35 - the float property on any of the HTML
11:38 - elements to make the other that is the
11:40 - next HTML elements appear on their
11:42 - original positions so guys in this way
11:45 - we have completed all these task in our
11:47 - exercise over here so comment in the
