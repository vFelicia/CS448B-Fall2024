00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to find square root of a
00:06 - number so guys we find the square root
00:08 - using the exponent operator so as you
00:11 - can see this two times multiplication
00:12 - symbol means exponent operator in Python
00:15 - Programming so over here for example
00:17 - let's say the number that you enter is 8
00:19 - so we have to find the square root by
00:22 - using this exponent symbol over here so
00:24 - we have on left hand side the number
00:25 - that is entered by the user or the
00:27 - variable to which the value is assigned
00:29 - and then on the right hand side we have
00:31 - 0.5 so guys this expression is going to
00:34 - help us in order to find the square root
00:36 - of a number in Python program so guys
00:38 - let us check this with the help of
00:39 - example over here so in the vs code what
00:42 - we are going to do is we are going to
00:43 - ask the user in order to enter the
00:46 - number so let's say we provide the
00:47 - number variable it is equal to we are
00:50 - going to convert that number to the
00:52 - integer since the input that will be
00:54 - provided by the user will be the string
00:56 - data type so over here we provide the
00:58 - input function and then what we can do
01:01 - is we can provide the label that is
01:02 - enter number to find square root so we
01:07 - say square root over here so guys
01:10 - basically the number that will be
01:11 - entered by the user in this case it will
01:13 - be of the data type string and we are
01:15 - going to convert it by using this int
01:17 - function over here now we are going to
01:19 - have a value inside the number and
01:21 - simply we can provide the square root by
01:23 - having the exponent symbol so over here
01:26 - we will provide number followed by the
01:28 - exponent symbol and Then followed by 0.5
01:31 - on the left hand side now guys we can
01:33 - simply store the result here so we can
01:35 - say square root as the variable name in
01:38 - order to make it more clear that we have
01:40 - square root of this number inside the
01:42 - square root variable now guys we can
01:44 - simply print the square root variable so
01:46 - we can say friend and then followed by
01:49 - square root of this number so over here
01:52 - we have open and close curly braces
01:54 - because we are going to use the dot
01:56 - format function after the string so
01:58 - square root of this number yes and then
02:01 - again we have open and close parenthesis
02:03 - so guys over here we have to provide two
02:05 - parameters the first one will be the
02:07 - number and then the second one will be
02:09 - the square root so over here we provide
02:11 - dot format followed by the parameters
02:13 - which will be number over here followed
02:16 - by comma and then square root so guys in
02:18 - this way we can find the square root of
02:20 - the number by using the exponent symbol
02:23 - so let me just save this file now and
02:24 - try running this code so guys the
02:26 - program is asking us enter the number to
02:28 - find square root so we know that the
02:31 - square root of the number 4 is 2 so let
02:33 - me provide 4 over here so when we
02:35 - provide 4 we press enter as you can see
02:37 - square root of 4 is 2 in this case since
02:40 - the square of this number that is 2 it
02:42 - is equal to 4 so basically the square
02:44 - root of this number that is 4 it will be
02:46 - 2 in this case now guys let me run this
02:48 - code once again and let me put another
02:50 - number so let's say when we provide 8 as
02:52 - the number and when we press enter as
02:55 - you can see this is the number that is a
02:56 - square root of 8 so basically it is the
02:58 - floating number that we are getting the
03:00 - result as when we provide the number as
03:02 - 8 and when we find the square root of 8
03:05 - over here so guys when we provide the
03:07 - number 16 what will be the output so
03:09 - over here when we provide the number 16
03:11 - you can check what will be the square
03:13 - root of 16 and you can comment the
03:15 - answer in the comment section below so
03:17 - guys this is the easy way in order to
03:19 - find the square root of the number using
03:21 - the Python program please make sure that
03:22 - you practice on your own so that on
03:24 - different inputs you get different
03:25 - outputs make sure that you like this
03:27 - video so that it reaches to more people
03:29 - and subscribe to this channel so that
03:31 - you get the notifications on upcoming
03:33 - videos as well the next video that we
03:34 - are going to talk about is Python
03:36 - program to swap to variables so stay
03:39 - tuned
