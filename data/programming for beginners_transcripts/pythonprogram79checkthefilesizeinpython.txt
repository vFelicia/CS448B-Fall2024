00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to write Python program to check
00:04 - the file size so guys basically there
00:06 - are two ways to find the file size in
00:08 - Python the first way is by using the OS
00:11 - module that we are going to check with
00:12 - the help of example as well and the
00:14 - second way is by using the path lab
00:16 - module so guys let us check both these
00:19 - ways in the vs code over here so the
00:21 - very first thing is we are going to
00:23 - import the OS module so we say import
00:25 - followed by OS and then guys what we
00:28 - have to do is we need to Define a
00:30 - variable that is file state over here
00:32 - that we will be using and it is equal to
00:34 - we will be using the OS module followed
00:37 - by Dot and then we have something called
00:39 - as stat function over here so it is
00:42 - going to take the entire directory path
00:44 - of the file for which we need to find
00:46 - the file size so guys for example
00:48 - purpose we will be using this test file
00:50 - over here that is test.txt so we will
00:53 - copy this directory path over here and
00:55 - then paste this inside the double quotes
00:57 - inside the parenthesis so over here we
00:59 - need to escape the backslash character
01:02 - as well so I'm going to provide another
01:04 - backslash character at all the instances
01:06 - and then after this in the end we are
01:08 - going to provide the name of the file
01:09 - that is test dot txt over here so guys
01:13 - we have defined with a variable that is
01:15 - file state now simply we can use this
01:17 - file state variable in order to get the
01:19 - statistics of this file which includes
01:22 - the file size as well so we are going to
01:24 - use the print function over here and
01:26 - then we will say file size in this case
01:28 - so we say file size followed by colon
01:31 - and then we use comma and then we have
01:33 - the file stat variable that we have just
01:36 - created followed by Dot and then we will
01:39 - be using the St size over here so as you
01:41 - can see we have St underscore size
01:43 - attribute so this is the property that
01:46 - will return us the integer which will be
01:48 - probably the file size over here for
01:51 - this particular file that we have
01:52 - mentioned so guys we are going to use
01:54 - this let me just save this file now and
01:56 - try running this code once again so as
01:58 - you can see we have got file size which
01:59 - is equal to 126 this is in bytes now
02:02 - over here so if we hover over this file
02:05 - as you can see we have got the size that
02:07 - is 126 over here so guys this is one way
02:09 - in order to get the file size by using
02:12 - OS module so we will say by using OS in
02:16 - this case now guys next what we will be
02:18 - doing is we will also use the path lab
02:20 - module in order to get the file size
02:22 - over here so we will be importing the
02:24 - path layer and then let's say again we
02:26 - will be using the firestat variable and
02:29 - this time we will reassign it to some
02:30 - other values over here we will be using
02:33 - the pathlib module followed by Dot and
02:36 - then we have the path class over here
02:38 - and inside this path class we will be
02:40 - providing this parameter that is the
02:42 - entire directory path of the file along
02:45 - with the file name so I'm going to copy
02:47 - this and paste this inside the double
02:49 - quotes over here so guys basically we
02:51 - have defined the file set over here once
02:53 - again by using the path lab module now
02:56 - next once again we will be using the
02:58 - print function so we say end and then
03:01 - this time we will say file size by using
03:06 - path lab so we will get the file size
03:08 - once again but this time we have used
03:10 - the pathway module and using that we
03:13 - have created the file state variable we
03:15 - have reassigned it to some other value
03:17 - that pathlab is providing us using this
03:19 - file name over here now guys we will be
03:21 - using the file state once again and then
03:24 - followed by Dot and then we have
03:26 - something called as stat function over
03:28 - here as you can see we will be using the
03:30 - stat function so since this is a
03:32 - function we have to provide the open and
03:34 - close parent assets followed by Dot and
03:36 - then once again we will be using the St
03:38 - followed by underscore and then we have
03:41 - something called as size over here so it
03:43 - is St underscore size parameter once
03:46 - again that we will be using so guys this
03:48 - is another attribute that belongs to
03:50 - this function so we will be using this
03:52 - attribute so let me just save this file
03:54 - now and try running this code once again
03:57 - so as you can see we have got file size
03:59 - by using OS it is 126 and once again we
04:02 - are getting file size by using pathlet
04:05 - 126 once again so Guys these are the two
04:08 - ways using which we can get the file
04:10 - size of any file that we mentioned
04:12 - inside this as a parameter by using Os
04:15 - or path lab module please make sure that
04:17 - you practice on your own so that on
04:19 - different inputs you get different
04:20 - outputs make sure that you like this
04:22 - video so that it reaches to more people
04:24 - and subscribe to the channel so that you
04:26 - get the notifications on upcoming videos
04:28 - as well the next video that we are going
04:30 - to talk about is Python program to
04:32 - reverse a number so stay tuned
