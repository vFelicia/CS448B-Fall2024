00:00 - so now we will see text transformation
00:02 - property in CSS so guys basically the
00:05 - text transform property is used to
00:08 - specify the uppercase and the lowercase
00:11 - letters in a text so guys let us check
00:13 - this with the help of examples in vs
00:15 - code over here so simply I'll remove the
00:17 - previous lines of code that we had
00:19 - written in the HTML and the CSS file
00:21 - over here and in the HTML file simply we
00:24 - are going to have a tag which is
00:25 - representing the heading two with the
00:27 - help of h2 tag in this case and we will
00:30 - say this is heading two so guys
00:33 - basically we have simply defined the
00:35 - text that is this is heading two over
00:37 - here let me just save this file now and
00:39 - try reloading this page on the browser
00:42 - so as you can see we have the h2 tag
00:44 - with the text that is this is heading
00:46 - two now guys let us say we want all the
00:49 - characters that is all the letters
00:51 - inside this heading to be uppercase
00:53 - letters so what we can do is simply
00:55 - inside the style. CSS file we have to
00:58 - define the tag in in this case we will
01:00 - Define h2 tag over here and simply we
01:03 - have the text transform property which
01:05 - is a CSS property that can help us in
01:08 - order to provide the uppercase or the
01:10 - lowercase letters for the text inside
01:13 - the HTML elements so as you can see it
01:15 - has multiple values we have capitalized
01:18 - then we have lower case we have none and
01:20 - then uppercase so guys by default the
01:22 - none value is being applied to all the
01:24 - HTML elements but in case we want all
01:27 - the letters to be uppercase simply we
01:29 - can provide the uppercase value over
01:31 - here so let me just save this file now
01:33 - and try reloading this page once again
01:35 - on the browser so as you can see all the
01:38 - characters over here in this case are
01:40 - uppercase and this is the way that we
01:42 - can use the text transform property with
01:44 - the help of the value that is uppercase
01:46 - in this case now guys apart from this
01:48 - let us say we want all the letters to be
01:50 - lower case so what we can do is let's
01:53 - say we have another paragraph over here
01:55 - so simply inside the HTML we will say P
01:58 - tag in this case and we type this is a
02:02 - simple paragraph So guys if you notice
02:05 - we have typed all the letters in the
02:07 - uppercase over here so that we can see
02:09 - how the lowercase value for the text
02:11 - transform will work for this paragraph
02:14 - tag so let me just save this file now
02:16 - and try reloading this page once again
02:18 - on the browser so as you can see by
02:20 - default all the letters are uppercase
02:22 - over here so what we can do is let's say
02:24 - we want all the letters to be lowercase
02:26 - for this P tag so simply we will provide
02:29 - the P tag over here inside the style.
02:31 - CSS property and again we will be using
02:33 - the text transform property in this case
02:36 - and this time we will be using the value
02:38 - as lower case so when we say lower case
02:40 - all the letters for this text inside the
02:43 - HTML element that is the P tag will be
02:46 - converted to lower case let me just save
02:48 - this file now and try reloading this
02:50 - page once again on the browser so as you
02:52 - can see all the letters are being
02:55 - displayed as lowercase letters now guys
02:57 - apart from that we have another value
02:59 - that is capitalized so let us check that
03:02 - as well so inside the HTML file in this
03:05 - case let us say we have the div element
03:08 - and this time we will type all the
03:09 - letters in lower case so simply we will
03:12 - say this is a test Dev element so guys
03:16 - over here all the letters are in lower
03:18 - case so this is a test Dev element is
03:21 - the text that we have written inside the
03:23 - dev element let me just save this file
03:25 - now and try reloading this page once
03:27 - again on the browser so as you can see
03:29 - all the letters for this div element is
03:31 - in lower case now so what we can do is
03:34 - simply we come to the style. CSS file
03:37 - and for the div tag we want to apply the
03:39 - text transform property so over here we
03:42 - say text transform and this time we
03:45 - select capitalize value so guys what
03:47 - will happen when we say capitalize as
03:49 - the value for the text transform let us
03:52 - check that so let me just save this file
03:54 - now and try reloading this page once
03:56 - again on the browser so as you can see
03:58 - the first letter of of all the words are
04:00 - now being converted to the uppercase
04:03 - letter now so the word that is this is
04:05 - having the first letter as uppercase and
04:08 - then we have this I as the uppercase
04:10 - then we have a as uppercase t is also
04:13 - uppercase and then this D inside the div
04:16 - is also uppercase and the last word that
04:18 - is element is also having the e letter
04:21 - as uppercase letter over here so guys
04:23 - this is the meaning of capitalize value
04:25 - for the text transform which means the
04:28 - first letter in all the words words will
04:30 - be converted to the uppercase letter and
04:32 - it will be displayed on the web page
04:34 - based on your requirements so guys we
04:36 - have seen all the values of the text to
04:37 - transform this is the uppercase value
04:40 - then we have the lowercase value and
04:42 - then we have the capitalized value and
04:44 - in this way you can set the text
04:45 - transform value based on your
04:47 - requirements comment in the comment
