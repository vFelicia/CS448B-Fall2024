00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to write Python program to count
00:04 - the number of stitches that is present
00:06 - in a number so guys it is very easy to
00:09 - find the number of digits in a number
00:10 - that is entered by the user so it can so
00:13 - happen that you have a number for which
00:15 - you want to find the number of digits
00:17 - which is entered by the user so
00:19 - basically there are two ways that you
00:20 - can use the very first way is by using
00:22 - the while loop that we are going to
00:24 - check with the help of examples as well
00:26 - and the second way is by using the
00:28 - length function that is LDN function
00:30 - after converting the number to the
00:32 - string guys apart from these two ways
00:34 - you can also Implement your own logic in
00:37 - order to find the number of digits but
00:39 - these are the two easiest ways in order
00:41 - to find the number of digits in a number
00:43 - so guys let us move to the vs code over
00:45 - here so the very first thing that we are
00:47 - going to do is we are going to define
00:48 - the num variable and let's say we
00:50 - initialize with the number that is one
00:53 - two three which is having three digits
00:54 - over here now guys it can be any number
00:56 - of digits so we need to find how many
00:58 - digits are present inside this num
01:00 - variable programmatically so guys over
01:03 - here we will be using the while loop so
01:05 - while num is not equal to zero so guys
01:09 - basically we are going to decrement this
01:11 - number by using the while loop over here
01:13 - so after this colon what we have to do
01:15 - is the very important expression in
01:18 - order to reduce the number of digits for
01:21 - a particular number is by using the
01:23 - Divide operator so over here we can use
01:25 - the Divide operator and then equal to 10
01:28 - so guys this is nothing but num divided
01:31 - by 10 and the result we are assigning it
01:33 - to the num variable again so this is the
01:36 - shorthand method so basically this will
01:38 - be interpreted as num it is equal to num
01:41 - divided by 10 and the forward slashes
01:44 - are two times that's because we don't
01:46 - want the result to be present in the
01:48 - decimal format so guys this will return
01:50 - us the integer number as the result and
01:53 - it will be assigned to this num variable
01:55 - over here now guys what is the next
01:57 - thing we need to increment the number of
01:59 - count so why here when we divide 123 by
02:02 - 10 we will get the quotient as 12 and
02:05 - that is what we are assigning to the num
02:07 - variable and the remainder that is 3
02:10 - will be discarded and then once the
02:12 - remainder that is 3 is discarded we need
02:15 - to increment the count so we are also
02:17 - going to define the count variable which
02:19 - is initially 0 and then once the
02:22 - remainder is discarded we are going to
02:24 - implement the count variable by 1 so we
02:27 - are doing count it is equal to count
02:28 - plus 1 and this is the shorthand method
02:31 - in order to increment the number by 1
02:33 - over here so this is same as when we say
02:36 - count is equal to count plus one and
02:39 - then guys next time again when num it is
02:41 - equal to 12 then again 12 divided by 10
02:44 - will return us the quotient that is 1
02:46 - and 2 will be discarded over here so
02:48 - count will be incremented again and the
02:51 - next time num it is equal to 1 so again
02:53 - we will be getting num divided by 10
02:55 - that is 1 divided by 10 which will give
02:58 - us the integer value as 0 this time and
03:00 - then in the last step count will be
03:02 - incremented by 1 to give us the result
03:04 - as 3 and then now since the num value is
03:07 - 0 the control flow will come out of this
03:09 - while loop over here and then simply we
03:11 - can have the print statement so we say
03:13 - print and then we say number of digit
03:17 - and then colon and then we can simply
03:19 - provide the count variable over here so
03:22 - that the number of digits is being
03:24 - displayed so guys let me just save this
03:26 - file now and try running this code so as
03:28 - you can see we are getting number of
03:29 - digits it is equal to 3 over here now
03:32 - guys let us check some other number over
03:33 - here so when we provide one two three
03:36 - four five six which have six number of
03:38 - digits let us save this file now and try
03:40 - running this code once again so that to
03:42 - see whether the number of digits are
03:44 - correct or not so as you can see number
03:46 - of digits is being tested as 6 over here
03:48 - so guys this particular logic is working
03:50 - as far as counting the number of digits
03:53 - are concerned now guys the next way is
03:55 - to find the number of edges by using the
03:57 - Len function after converting the number
04:00 - to this thing so guys basically this is
04:02 - a number we can convert it into the
04:04 - string and using the Len function that
04:07 - is applicable to the string variables we
04:10 - can count the number of digits over here
04:12 - so what we can do is simply we can
04:13 - remove these lines of code over here
04:15 - which is not required and then we can
04:18 - simply have number of digits and then
04:20 - over here what we can do is first of all
04:22 - we need to convert this number to string
04:24 - so we provide Str class over here as you
04:27 - can see and inside the brackets we need
04:29 - to provide this num variable so that
04:32 - this particular integer is converted to
04:34 - string first and then guys after
04:36 - converting this to string we can use the
04:38 - LDN function over here so as you can see
04:41 - Len function can take one parameter that
04:43 - is the string or object in order to find
04:46 - its length over here so basically for
04:48 - this length function we are providing
04:50 - the entire string which is coming from
04:52 - this number variable so let me just save
04:55 - this file now and try running this code
04:57 - once again so as you can see number of
04:59 - digits it is displayed as 6 over here
05:01 - now guys let me just put some other
05:03 - number we can have 7623 as the number
05:06 - let me just save this file now and try
05:07 - running this code so it is having the
05:09 - number of digits as 4 and that is what
05:11 - is being displayed over here so guys
05:13 - this is another easy way in all order to
05:16 - find the number of digits by converting
05:18 - the number into the string and then
05:20 - using the Len function in order to find
05:22 - the length of the string guys what will
05:24 - be the number of digits for this number
05:26 - that is present inside the num variable
05:29 - over here that is 98623 comment in the
05:32 - comment section below let us see whether
05:34 - your answer is correct or not so please
