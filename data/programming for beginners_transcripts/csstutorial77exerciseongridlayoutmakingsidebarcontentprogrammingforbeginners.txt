00:00 - so now we will work on an exercise on
00:02 - grid layout in CSS and we will be making
00:05 - a sidebar and the content with the help
00:07 - of the grid layout so guys we will
00:09 - design a sidebar and content area on
00:12 - left and right sections by using the
00:14 - grid layout in CSS and apart from this
00:17 - we will also add the header and the
00:18 - footer sections so guys let us move to
00:20 - the vs code over here and simply I'm
00:22 - going to remove the previous lines of
00:24 - code inside the HTML and the CSS files
00:27 - that we had written previously now guys
00:29 - what we will do is simply we will have
00:31 - the container diff tag over here so we
00:33 - have the diff tag with the class
00:35 - container and then inside this we will
00:37 - have the sidebar and the content areas
00:40 - so basically we are going to have the
00:42 - class name that is sidebar over here
00:44 - simply I'm going to have the content
00:46 - that is sidebar for this diff tag and
00:48 - then we are going to also have the
00:51 - content class which is another diff tag
00:53 - over here so guys basically we have the
00:55 - content keyword in this case let me just
00:58 - save this file now and try reloading
01:00 - this page on the browser so as you can
01:01 - see these are the two div tags that we
01:03 - are starting from scratch and we are
01:05 - going to have the sidebar on the left
01:07 - hand side of the screen and the content
01:09 - on the right hand side so guys what we
01:11 - have to do is we need to make this
01:13 - container class as a grid layout
01:15 - container so simply I'm going to copy
01:17 - this container class over here and then
01:19 - inside the style. CSS file we are going
01:22 - to Define certain CSS properties so
01:24 - first of all we have the display is
01:26 - equal to grid and then apart from this
01:28 - we will also have certain background
01:30 - color so let's say we have the
01:32 - background color of yellow and also we
01:34 - will provide certain padding so let's
01:36 - say we have 20 pixels of padding over
01:38 - here let me just save this file now and
01:40 - try reloading this page once again on
01:42 - the browser so as you can see this is
01:44 - the container that is having the two
01:46 - diff tags that is the sidebar and the
01:47 - content now guys we need to make two
01:49 - columns out of this container on First
01:51 - Column we will have the sidebar and then
01:54 - inside the second column we will have
01:55 - the content so guys what we will do is
01:57 - simply we will use the another CSS
01:59 - property that is grid template columns
02:02 - which helps us in order to provide the
02:04 - number of columns over here so since we
02:06 - have provided the two values in this
02:08 - case with the help of the auto keywords
02:10 - there will be two columns that will be
02:12 - created and then guys apart from this we
02:14 - also want certain column Gap in between
02:17 - both the columns so we will see a column
02:19 - gap of 20 pixels over here so let me
02:21 - just save this file now and try
02:23 - reloading this page once again on the
02:25 - browser so as you can see the sidebar
02:27 - and the content are now getting
02:28 - displayed horizontally in this case now
02:30 - guys we will also have certain CSS
02:32 - properties to both these diff tags so
02:34 - that we can identify and separate them
02:37 - as far as the grid container is
02:39 - concerned so what we will do is inside
02:41 - the container class we will provide the
02:43 - CSS property to div tags that are having
02:45 - the sidebar and the content classes
02:48 - respectively so simply we are going to
02:50 - use the class names over here that is
02:52 - the sidebar and the content and we are
02:54 - going to have certain common CSS
02:56 - properties over here so first of all we
02:58 - will have the background color color so
03:00 - let's say we have the background color
03:01 - as aqua color over here and also we will
03:04 - provide the padding of 10 pixels in this
03:06 - case let me just save this file now and
03:08 - try reloading this page so as you can
03:10 - see we can now see the two columns over
03:12 - here that is sidebar and content in this
03:14 - case and also we are having the column
03:16 - gap of 20 pixels over here now guys what
03:19 - we will do is we will decrease the width
03:21 - of the Side Bar and increase the width
03:23 - of the content since a sidebar takes
03:25 - only around 20 to 25% of the screen
03:28 - width over here so what we have to do is
03:30 - simply we will provide the 200 pixels as
03:33 - the size of the First Column over here
03:35 - instead of the auto keyword so let me
03:37 - just save this file now and try
03:38 - reloading this page once again on the
03:40 - browser as you can see the width of the
03:42 - sidebar is now reduced in this case now
03:44 - guys apart from this we also want to add
03:47 - the header and photo sections over here
03:49 - so simply we are going to add two more
03:52 - diff tags in this case and then we are
03:54 - going to have the class names as header
03:56 - and footer respectively so guys over
03:58 - here we have the header and footer in
04:00 - this case and then inside this diff tag
04:02 - that is the header diff tag we will have
04:04 - the H1 tag over here and we will say
04:07 - this is a heading and also for the
04:09 - footer tag we are going to have the
04:11 - statement that this is a footer section
04:14 - over here so guys we have this is a
04:16 - heading section and we have this is a
04:18 - footer section inside the header and the
04:20 - footer classes respectively now guys let
04:22 - me just save this file now and let us
04:24 - see how it looks like on the UI so when
04:26 - we reload this page as you can see this
04:28 - is a heading is now getting displayed
04:30 - over here on the first row and the
04:32 - sidebar is also getting displayed on the
04:34 - first row and the second column so what
04:36 - we have to do is we need to define the
04:38 - grid column start and grid column end
04:40 - over here so that this particular
04:42 - heading takes the entire space that is
04:45 - from left to right over here so inside
04:47 - the style. CSS file for the header and
04:50 - the footer classes we are going to have
04:52 - certain common CSS properties so over
04:54 - here we have defined the header and the
04:57 - footer classes in this case so what we
04:59 - have to do is we need to make the grid
05:01 - column start that is this particular CSS
05:04 - property start from the first line over
05:06 - here and then it should end at the third
05:09 - line why so because we have two columns
05:11 - over here or we can also say that the
05:13 - header and the footer diff Tex must
05:16 - occupy the space of the two columns so
05:19 - we have to define the grid column end as
05:21 - well so over here we provide the grid
05:23 - column end in this case and then we
05:25 - provide the line number three over here
05:27 - let me just save this file now andent
05:29 - try reloading this page so as you can
05:31 - see we have this is heading section and
05:33 - then we have this is footer section over
05:35 - here apart from this let us also provide
05:37 - certain padding at the background color
05:39 - over here so let's say we have the
05:41 - padding of 10 pixels again and the
05:43 - background color as well so let's say we
05:45 - use this chart reuse background color
05:47 - over here let me just save this file now
05:49 - and try reloading this page once again
05:51 - on the browser as you can see we have
05:53 - this is heading section and then we have
05:55 - this is footer section over here now
05:57 - guys there is one problem in this case
05:58 - we have three number number of rows that
06:00 - is first row is over here then the
06:02 - second row is sidebar and the content
06:03 - and the third row is the photo section
06:05 - we need to have certain Gap in between
06:08 - all the rows so what we can do is
06:09 - similar to column Gap we can have the
06:12 - row Gap as well and this time let's say
06:14 - we have 10 pixels of row Gap let me just
06:16 - save this file now and try reloading
06:18 - this page so as you can see these are
06:19 - the gaps that we have provided over here
06:21 - now guys apart from this we also want to
06:24 - align this text at the center of the
06:26 - diff tag so simply we are going to use
06:28 - the text align here property and the
06:30 - value as Center so when we reload this
06:33 - page as you can see the header and the
06:34 - phot section are now having the text at
06:37 - the center of the diff tags over here so
06:39 - guys this is the way that we have
06:41 - designed our sidebar and the content
06:43 - over here let us have certain content in
06:45 - the form of links inside the sidebar so
06:48 - what we can do is simply over here in
06:49 - the HTML file instead of having the
06:52 - sidebar over here we will have the
06:54 - unordered list in this case and inside
06:56 - this we will have the list items over
06:58 - here and inside the list item we will
07:00 - have the a tags in this case so guys let
07:02 - us Define certain links inside the
07:05 - sidebar so we have these many links over
07:07 - here we will rename the content inside
07:10 - the links so first of all we have the
07:12 - home link in this case and let's say we
07:14 - have the blog and Then followed by
07:16 - videos and then let's say we have
07:18 - certain programming languages so first
07:20 - of all we have Java and then let's say
07:22 - we have HTML and of course we are going
07:25 - through the CSS tutorial so over here we
07:27 - have the CSS link as well so guys if you
07:30 - are new to this channel we are making a
07:32 - lot of CSS tutorial videos which you can
07:34 - find in the playlist that I have given
07:36 - in the description section so you can go

07:44 - is programming for beginners so that you
07:46 - get the notifications on the upcoming
07:48 - videos as well so guys over here we have
07:50 - defined certain links inside the
07:52 - unordered list let me just save this
07:54 - file now and try reloading this page
07:56 - once again on the browser so as you can
07:58 - see we have all these list items inside
08:00 - the sidebar over here that you can
08:02 - navigate to and then guys inside the
08:04 - content we can have certain random text
08:07 - over here so instead of content what we
08:09 - will do is we will use the lurm M
08:11 - abbreviation over here so basically we
08:13 - are going to Define certain random text
08:16 - in this case let me just save this file
08:17 - now and try reloading this page once
08:19 - again on the browser so as you can see
08:21 - we have the random text that is getting
08:23 - generated over here so guys in this way
08:25 - we have easily designed our header
08:27 - section and the footer section as well
08:29 - you can have your own CSS properties for
08:31 - these header and the photo sections
08:33 - respectively and apart from this on the
08:35 - left hand side we have the sidebar
08:37 - content which is having the list of
08:39 - links in this case and we also have the
08:41 - content section over here we can also
08:44 - have the right hand side sidebar over
08:46 - here of let's say some of the popular
08:48 - videos or the popular blog post in this
08:50 - case so you can simply provide the third
08:52 - column in this case which should be
08:53 - present only in this second row over
08:55 - here as per your requirements so guys
08:58 - I'll leave this up to you as a home
08:59 - homework for you so that you can
09:00 - practice on your own and add a right
09:02 - hand side sidebar that might have
