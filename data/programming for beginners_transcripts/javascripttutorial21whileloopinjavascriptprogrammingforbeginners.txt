00:00 - so now we will see while loop in
00:02 - JavaScript so guys basically while loop
00:04 - can execute a block of code as long as
00:06 - the specified condition is true so guys
00:09 - in short whatever lines of code that you
00:11 - want to execute multiple number of times
00:14 - until and unless the condition is not
00:16 - true so you can simply use the V Loop in
00:18 - JavaScript so as you can see this is the
00:20 - syntax over here basically we have the V
00:23 - keyword in this case followed by the
00:25 - space character and then inside the open
00:27 - and close parenthesis we have the
00:29 - condition and if this particular
00:31 - condition is true then the code block to
00:33 - be executed needs to be provided within
00:35 - the open and close curly braces over
00:37 - here so guys this is the syntax of the
00:39 - while loop that we will be using with
00:41 - the help of examples as well so guys let
00:43 - us move to the vs code over here and
00:45 - what we will do is simply we are going
00:47 - to create the separate file for the
00:49 - while loop and in the upcoming tutorial
00:51 - videos as well we are going to create
00:53 - the separate files so that it becomes
00:55 - easy for us to refer to them so guys
00:57 - over here I have created a new folder
00:59 - that this tutorial under the JavaScript
01:01 - folder in this case and let us create a
01:04 - new file over here I will give the
01:05 - tutorial number that is 21 in this case
01:08 - followed by underscore and then we have
01:10 - y Loop in this case so guys basically
01:12 - this is the file that we are going to
01:14 - work with over here so what we will do
01:16 - is let's say we want to print the first
01:18 - five numbers starting from 1 up to five
01:21 - so let us say we provide the variable
01:23 - that is I in this case we first of all
01:25 - initialize it with the value that is one
01:27 - over here so simply what we can do is we
01:30 - can go through this particular I
01:31 - variable and print it one at a time and
01:34 - then at the end of the Y Loop we can
01:36 - increment the value of I by one in this
01:39 - case so guys simply we will use the V
01:41 - keyword over here and then inside the
01:43 - open and close parenthesis we need to
01:45 - check whether I is less than or equal to
01:48 - 5 in this case and then guys if this
01:50 - particular condition is true in this
01:52 - case the initial value of I is 1 over
01:55 - here it is less than or equal to 5 so
01:57 - the control flow will go inside the Y
02:00 - Loop in this case that is between the
02:01 - open and close curly braces and then we
02:04 - will have the console. log statement so
02:06 - guys over here simply we can provide the
02:08 - value of I so let us say we use the
02:11 - string literal over here so simply we
02:13 - say the value of I is and Then followed
02:17 - by dollar symbol followed by open and
02:19 - close curly braces in this case and then
02:21 - we will have the I variable inside the
02:23 - curly braces so in this way the value of
02:26 - I is one will be printed over here now
02:29 - guys it is very important to update the
02:31 - variable value that is I in this case to
02:33 - the next value or else your while loop
02:35 - will be infinite while loop and it will
02:38 - go on printing the value that is one in
02:40 - this case so simply we have to increase
02:42 - the value of I by 1 over here so we can
02:45 - do it in multiple ways over here simply
02:47 - we can have the statement that is I it
02:49 - is equal to I + 1 in this case so it is
02:52 - not the shortest format of the statement
02:54 - over here either you can use this or we
02:56 - can also use the assignment operator
02:58 - that is I Plus plus it is equal to 1 so
03:01 - this particular statement will also
03:03 - increase the count of I by one over here
03:06 - or else simply we can use the increment
03:08 - operator as well so we will do I ++ over
03:11 - here so guys basically any of the
03:13 - statements can be used by you in order
03:15 - to increase the count of I by one in
03:18 - this case so let me just save this file
03:20 - now and let us run this code on the
03:21 - terminal so over here we need to go
03:23 - inside the new folder that we have
03:25 - created that is tutorial under the
03:28 - JavaScript folder and then inside this
03:30 - we are going to provide the node keyword
03:32 - followed by the name of the file that is
03:35 - 21 while loop over here guys we have not
03:38 - provided the extension over here that is
03:40 - JS file so what we will do is simply we
03:42 - will provide JS as the extension for
03:45 - this particular file and then when we
03:47 - run this code once again over here we
03:49 - should be able to see the JS extension
03:51 - so when we press enter over here as you
03:53 - can see the value of I is 1 and Then
03:56 - followed by the value of I is 2 and so
03:58 - on the other value Val are also getting
04:00 - printed over here so guys in this way we
04:03 - can easily use the while loop in order
04:05 - to execute certain lines of code based
04:07 - on the condition that is met over here
04:09 - so whatever expression that we provide
04:11 - if it is true then only the control flow
04:14 - will go inside the open and close curly
04:16 - braces and those lines of code will be
04:18 - executed in this case guys it is very
04:20 - important to note that whatever
04:22 - condition is there over here first of
04:24 - all that particular condition will be
04:26 - checked if it is true or not and only if
04:28 - it is true then only the control flow
04:30 - will go inside this block of code now
04:33 - guys let us say if we have provided the
04:35 - condition that is I is less than or
04:36 - equal to 0 in this case so at the start
04:39 - only if you see the I value is one right
04:41 - now so it is not less than or equal to
04:43 - zero this time so the control flow will
04:45 - not go inside this particular block of
04:48 - code so let us check that as well so
04:50 - when we save this file now and try
04:52 - running this code once again over here
04:53 - on the terminal as you can see there are
04:55 - no statements that are getting printed
04:57 - over here that's because the condition
04:59 - is not true for the first instance
05:01 - itself so guys in order to at least
05:03 - execute these lines of code once what we
05:06 - can do is instead of using the while
05:08 - loop we can use the do while loop over
05:10 - here so simply we have to replace this
05:13 - while condition in this case and first
05:15 - of all we provide the do statement over
05:17 - here and then after the block of code
05:19 - that means after the open and close
05:21 - curly braces over here simply we will
05:23 - provide the condition that is while in
05:25 - this case and Then followed by the
05:27 - condition so in this case we are
05:28 - supposed to check I is less than or
05:30 - equal to zero this time so guys
05:32 - basically what we are doing is at least
05:34 - we are telling The Interpreter to at
05:36 - least execute these lines of code once
05:39 - over here before checking the condition
05:41 - so when the control flow checks that
05:43 - this is the do statement over here it
05:45 - will go inside the block of code and it
05:47 - will print this particular statement and
05:49 - then increase the counter of I variable
05:51 - over here and then after this it is
05:53 - going to check whether the condition is
05:55 - true if the condition is true over here
05:57 - then again it will go inside the do
05:59 - state statement that is this particular
06:01 - block of code and then it will print the
06:03 - statements that is supposed to be
06:05 - executed over here so guys let us check
06:07 - that as well it is important to note
06:09 - that whenever we are using the do while
06:11 - loop over here we have to provide the
06:14 - semicolon at the end of the while
06:16 - condition in this case let me just save
06:17 - this file now and try running this code
06:19 - once again over here on the terminal so
06:21 - as you can see the value of I is one so
06:24 - at least once this particular statement
06:26 - is executed and the value of I is
06:28 - getting printed over here but after this
06:31 - the condition is not true in this case
06:33 - because I value is two right now after
06:36 - incrementing the value of I and two is
06:38 - not less than or equal to zero this time
06:41 - so guys in this way either you can use
06:42 - the while loop or the do while loop as
06:44 - well based on the project requirements
06:47 - so guys comment in the comment section
