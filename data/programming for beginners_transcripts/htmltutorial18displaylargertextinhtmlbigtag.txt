00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to learn about larger text in HTML
00:05 - using the big tag so guys basically the
00:07 - content of the starting page and the
00:10 - ending big tag is displayed one font
00:12 - larger than the rest of the text
00:14 - surrounding it so guys let us check this
00:16 - with the help of example now in the vs
00:19 - code so what we will do is simply we
00:21 - will have another paragraph over here
00:22 - using the peak tag and then we will say
00:25 - this text is big in this paragraph So
00:30 - guys we have a simple statement in this
00:32 - new paragraph over here this text is big
00:34 - in this paragraph so let me just save
00:36 - this file now and try reloading this
00:38 - page on the browser so as you can see we
00:41 - have this text is built in this
00:42 - paragraph now guys what we will do is we
00:45 - will have the text is Big that is these
00:48 - three words appear one font size larger
00:51 - than the rest of the text so what we
00:52 - have to do is we need to enclose these
00:55 - three words within the big tag over here
00:57 - so we will move to the vs code and then
00:59 - and we will say big in this case so this
01:02 - is the big tag that we can use so
01:05 - basically as you can see since the font
01:07 - color of this tag is red the stack is
01:09 - deprecated in the newer versions of the
01:12 - browser but guys still it can work in
01:13 - certain browsers so let me just save
01:15 - this file now and try reloading this
01:17 - page once again so as you can see the
01:20 - text is big it is being displayed as one
01:23 - font size larger compared to the other
01:26 - text in the same paragraph now guys if
01:28 - we see what exactly is happening behind
01:30 - the scenes we can simply right click
01:32 - over here and we can use the inspect
01:34 - option so when we use the inspect option
01:37 - you can see under elements the paragraph
01:39 - is being displayed over here using the P
01:41 - tags and inside this we have this text
01:44 - is big in this paragraph now these three
01:46 - words are being enclosed within the big
01:48 - tag over here and the big tag is being
01:51 - given the font size as larger and this
01:53 - is what is happening behind the scenes
01:55 - the larger value for the font size is
01:58 - making these words appear bigger than
02:01 - the other text in the same paragraph now
02:04 - guys since this tag is deprecated it is
02:06 - recommended that we use the style
02:07 - attribute over here now how do we use
02:10 - the style attribute only for these three
02:12 - words so we will remove these tag first
02:14 - of all and then we can have this pen tag
02:17 - over here so instead of the big tag we
02:20 - can have the span tag so we say spam and
02:23 - then we have the closings pen tag over
02:25 - here after the backward in this case and
02:28 - then we say this text back so guys
02:31 - basically what we have done is we have
02:33 - enclosed the text is Big these three
02:35 - words within the span tag now what will
02:38 - happen after this let me just save this
02:40 - file now and try reloading this page so
02:42 - as you can see this is a normal
02:43 - paragraph now but since we have used the
02:46 - span tag it is used in order to group
02:48 - certain words and apply certain styles
02:51 - to these words over here so what we can
02:53 - do is insert this pen tag we can have
02:56 - the style attribute in this case and the
02:58 - style can have the font size so guys
03:01 - what we have seen is the font size value
03:03 - was larger so over here we will again
03:06 - provide larger value for the font size
03:09 - and then let me just save this file now
03:11 - and try reloading this page once again
03:13 - so now we can see that text is big is
03:16 - appearing as one font size larger
03:18 - compared to the other text in the same
03:20 - paragraph So guys this is the
03:22 - replacement of the big tag that we have
03:24 - seen just now either we can use the big
03:27 - tag or in the newer versions of the
03:29 - browser we can also use the span tag and
03:31 - along with that we can use the style
03:33 - attribute over here we are going to
03:35 - learn more about the style attribute and
03:37 - what are the different properties and
03:39 - the values that we can have inside the
03:41 - style attribute in the upcoming videos
