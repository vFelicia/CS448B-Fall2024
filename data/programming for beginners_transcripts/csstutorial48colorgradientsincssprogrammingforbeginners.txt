00:00 - so now we will see color gradients in
00:02 - CSS so guys basically the CSS gradients
00:05 - let you display the smooth transitions
00:08 - between two or more specified colors and
00:11 - this we are going to check with the help
00:12 - of examples as well and there are
00:14 - basically three types of gradients that
00:16 - we will be seeing in the CSS so the very
00:19 - first gradient type is the linear
00:21 - gradient over here for which the
00:23 - directions can go from top to down or up
00:26 - left right or diagonally as well apart
00:28 - from this we also have the radial
00:30 - gradient that we can use which is
00:32 - defined by their Center and then the
00:34 - third gradient is the conic gradients
00:37 - which is rotated around the center point
00:39 - so guys let us check all these with the
00:41 - help of examples in VSS code over here
00:43 - so simply I'm going to remove the
00:44 - previous lines of code that we had
00:46 - return in the HTML and the style. CSS
00:49 - file in this case now guys let us simply
00:51 - provide the diff tag over here and for
00:53 - this diff tag we are going to provide
00:55 - certain CSS properties so inside the
00:57 - style. CSS file we will have the diff
01:00 - tag that is the CSS selector and inside
01:02 - the curly braces let us say first of all
01:04 - we provide the simple background color
01:06 - so guys basically this background color
01:08 - is the solid color that we are providing
01:11 - and it is not a mixture of two or more
01:13 - specific colors over here so let me
01:15 - provide the width and height of this
01:17 - diff tag as well so in this case let us
01:19 - provide the width as 500 pixels and also
01:23 - the height as 300 pixels right now so
01:25 - guys over here we have provided the
01:27 - width and height properties as well
01:29 - apart from this letter us also provide
01:30 - certain border so let's say we have two
01:32 - pixels border width and then the Border
01:35 - style is solid and the Border color is
01:37 - black right now so guys let me just save
01:39 - this file now and try reloading this
01:41 - page on the browser so as you can see we
01:44 - have this diff tag that is having the
01:46 - background color yellow it is also
01:48 - having the border and specific width and
01:51 - height that we have defined so guys this
01:53 - is the solid background color that we
01:55 - have seen so far so basically what
01:57 - gradient colors allow you to do is have
02:00 - multiple colors and there will be smooth
02:02 - transitions in between those two colors
02:05 - so guys basically we can have two or
02:06 - more colors in this case so let us see
02:08 - how linear gradients can be used so guys
02:11 - in this case what we have to do is we
02:13 - need to comment out this background
02:15 - color CSS property since in order to use
02:18 - the gradient colors we need to use the
02:20 - background image CSS property so guys
02:23 - over here we will say background image
02:25 - so guys this is the CSS property that
02:27 - you have to use in order to provide the
02:30 - gradient colors and then over here
02:32 - simply we are going to say linear
02:34 - gradient in this case so you can see
02:36 - this is the method that we have to use
02:38 - and inside the linear gradient we need
02:40 - to provide the colors so guys let us say
02:42 - we provide yellow color as the first
02:44 - color and followed by comma and then
02:47 - let's say we provide green color as the
02:49 - second color over here so guys basically
02:51 - these are the two colors that we want to
02:53 - be present as the background color for
02:55 - this diff tag and basically the default
02:58 - direction will be top to down down in
03:00 - this case so guys you can see that we
03:02 - can go in any direction we are going to
03:04 - see that how we can set the direction
03:06 - but first of all the default direction
03:08 - will be top to down and that we are
03:10 - going to check with the help of these
03:12 - two colors that is yellow and green so
03:14 - guys let me just save this file now and
03:16 - try reloading this page once again on
03:18 - the browser so as you can see on top we
03:20 - have the yellow color and then as we go
03:22 - down the yellow color component is
03:24 - getting reduced and then the green color
03:27 - component is getting increased over here
03:29 - and at the end that is at the bottom of
03:31 - this particular Dev element we have the
03:33 - complete green color over here so guys
03:35 - in this way we can create the linear
03:37 - gradient from top to bottom which is the
03:39 - default direction we can also make the
03:42 - direction from left to right as well so
03:44 - how we can do that simply before the
03:46 - first color we can also set the
03:48 - direction from left to right in this
03:50 - case so how we can do that simply when
03:52 - we provide the first color over here
03:54 - before that we need to provide the
03:56 - direction that is to right in this case
03:59 - so guys basically we have this direction
04:01 - that is to right we can change it to
04:03 - left up down so basically by default we
04:06 - have two down over here so since it is
04:08 - the default value so we don't have to
04:10 - provide it but in case if we want to
04:11 - change the direction so simply we can
04:13 - say to right so basically in this case
04:16 - yellow color will start from the left
04:18 - and then it will end with the green
04:20 - color on the right of this div tag over
04:22 - here so let me just save this file now
04:24 - and try reloading this page once again
04:26 - on the browser so as you can see yellow
04:27 - color is starting from the left and it
04:29 - is ending with the green color on the
04:31 - right now guys apart from this we can
04:33 - also have multiple colors over here we
04:35 - have just used yellow and green color
04:37 - right now we can also provide the third
04:39 - color after providing comma so let's say
04:42 - we provide blue color in this case so
04:44 - blue color is the third color let me
04:46 - just save this file now and try
04:47 - reloading this page once again on the
04:49 - browser so as you can see we have the
04:50 - yellow color on the left and then when
04:52 - we move to the middle of this diff tag
04:54 - we are getting the green color and then
04:56 - when we move to the right of this div
04:58 - tag we are getting the blue color over
05:00 - here and this is the smooth transition
05:02 - that you can see so there is no sudden
05:04 - green color after a particular point on
05:06 - this div tag and there is no sudden blue
05:08 - color after this point over here so guys
05:10 - basically this is the smooth transition
05:12 - that is happening between the colors
05:14 - that we have provided and you can
05:15 - provide any number of colors over here
05:18 - so guys in this way we can use the
05:19 - linear gradient over here so this was
05:21 - the simple example in this case we can
05:23 - also use the angles instead of
05:25 - directions so guys over here what we
05:27 - have done is we have provided the
05:29 - direction to right or we can also say to
05:31 - left over here so basically the yellow
05:33 - color will start from the right and the
05:35 - blue color will end at the left so let
05:37 - me just save this file now so basically
05:39 - the colors will reverse themselves in
05:41 - terms of directions the yellow color
05:42 - will come on the right and the blue
05:44 - color will go to the left whereas the
05:46 - green color will stay at the middle so
05:47 - when we reload this page as you can see
05:50 - the direction is to left over here now
05:52 - guys how do we provide the angles so
05:54 - basically when we say 0° over here so
05:57 - let me just provide 0 d G so in this way
06:00 - you can provide the angle over here so
06:02 - let me just save this file now and try
06:04 - reloading this page once again on the
06:06 - browser the color is starting from the
06:08 - bottom so as you can see we have the
06:10 - yellow color at the bottom and then the
06:12 - blue color at the top and when we say
06:14 - 180° over here let me just change it to
06:17 - 180° this will be the default behavior
06:19 - when the yellow color is coming from top
06:21 - and the blue color is ending at the
06:23 - bottom over here so as you can see this
06:25 - is 180° right now so guys what will
06:27 - happen when we provide 90° over here let
06:30 - us check that as well so let me just
06:32 - save this file now and try reloading
06:33 - this page so as you can see it is coming
06:35 - from left over here right now so in this
06:37 - way you can also provide the angles as
06:40 - far as the degrees are concerned as the
06:42 - first parameter before providing the
06:44 - first color and what is the default
06:45 - behavior when we save this file now and
06:47 - try reloading this page as you can see
06:49 - the color is coming from the top which
06:51 - means it is 180° by default so if we
06:54 - check that when we provide 180° over
06:57 - here so let me just save this file now
06:59 - and by reloading this page so there is
07:01 - no change right now over here so by
07:03 - default it is 180° now guys apart from
07:05 - this we can also have the rainbow colors
07:07 - over here so before checking the random
07:09 - colors we can also check how we can set
07:12 - the colors diagonally so guys let us go
07:14 - from top left to right bottom over here
07:17 - so how do we do that so basically simply
07:19 - we have to provide two right bottom in
07:21 - this case so we say two right bottom so
07:25 - guys when we save this file now and try
07:27 - reloading this page once again on the
07:29 - browser so as you can see the yellow
07:30 - color is coming from the top left and
07:33 - then we have the green color the
07:35 - direction is diagonal right now and then
07:37 - in the end the bottom right is now
07:39 - having the blue color and that is how
07:40 - you can set the gradient color as
07:42 - diagonal in this case now guys let us
07:44 - check another example that is how we can
07:46 - create the rainbow colors so what we can
07:48 - do is simply we have to go from left to
07:50 - right so over here we are going to keep
07:52 - to right in this case and then we are
07:54 - going to define the colors of the
07:56 - rainbow so guys first of all the first
07:58 - color is violet in this case
07:59 - and Then followed by Indigo and then we
08:02 - have blue and then we have green
08:04 - followed by yellow and then we have
08:07 - orange and Then followed by red so guys
08:10 - this is the sequence of the rainbow
08:11 - color so we have violet indigo blue
08:14 - green yellow orange red so guys let me
08:17 - just save this file now and try
08:18 - reloading this page so remember that we
08:20 - have set the direction as to right so
08:22 - basically it will go from left to right
08:24 - in this case so when we save this file
08:26 - so as you can see these are the rainbow
08:28 - colors that you can see on the this
08:29 - particular diff tag over here so guys in
08:31 - this way we can easily use the linear
08:33 - gradient function for the background
08:36 - image property so guys it is very
08:37 - important to note that we are using the
08:39 - background image CSS property instead of
08:42 - the background color property now guys
08:44 - apart from this let us move to the next
08:45 - gradient that is radial gradients over
08:47 - here which is defined by their Center so
08:50 - guys let us check the example of the
08:51 - radial gradient in this case so instead
08:54 - of using the linear gradient simply we
08:56 - have to provide the radial gradient over
08:58 - here so so inside this radial gradient
09:01 - what we have to do is let us provide
09:03 - certain color so we will provide yellow
09:05 - and then green color in this case let me
09:07 - just save this file now and try
09:09 - reloading this page once again on the
09:11 - browser so guys this is the radial
09:13 - gradient actually it is the size of the
09:15 - ellipse over here in between you can see
09:17 - that it is the yellow color and then the
09:19 - outside of this particular div element
09:21 - is the green color over here when we
09:23 - provide more colors so let us provide
09:25 - the blue color as well as the third
09:27 - color let me just reload this page so as
09:29 - you can see the ellipse is getting
09:32 - displayed on this particular web browser
09:34 - which is the default shape when we use
09:36 - the radial gradient so guys in this way
09:38 - if you want this kind of gradient to be
09:40 - displayed on any of the HTML element you
09:43 - can use the radial gradient and apart
09:45 - from this we can also have the circle
09:47 - shape as well instead of the ellipse
09:50 - shape so guys by default this is the
09:51 - ellipse shape but before the first color
09:54 - simply we can provide the keyword that
09:56 - is circle over here so guys what will
09:58 - happen is instead of of ellipse we will
10:00 - have the circle shape for this
10:01 - particular radial gradient that will be
10:04 - implemented so let me just save this
10:05 - file now and try reloading this page
10:07 - once again on the browser so as you can
10:09 - see this is the circular shape of this
10:11 - particular radial gradient that is
10:13 - getting displayed inside this div
10:15 - element over here so guys in this way
10:17 - you can use the radial gradients as well
10:19 - apart from this we also have conic
10:21 - gradients which is rotated around a
10:23 - center point so guys let us check this
10:25 - with the help of example over here so
10:27 - simply what we have to do is iner of
10:29 - radial gradients we can say conic
10:32 - gradient in this case so we have conic
10:34 - hyphen gradient and let us use some
10:37 - color so again we will use the yellow
10:39 - color and the green color for this conic
10:41 - gradient and Then followed by semicolon
10:43 - over here let me just save this file now
10:45 - and try reloading this page once again
10:47 - on the browser so guys as you can see
10:49 - this is the rotation that is happening
10:51 - from this particular point over here
10:53 - first of all we have the yellow color
10:55 - which is making a transition over here
10:57 - as we move in the clockwise Direction
10:59 - and then we go towards the green color
11:01 - over here and then in this way the
11:03 - Corning gradient can help us in order to
11:05 - display the HTML element with this
11:08 - particular gradient color let us provide
11:10 - some other color over here so let's say
11:12 - we provide the third color as the aqua
11:14 - color let me just save this file now and
11:16 - try reloading this page once again on
11:17 - the browser so as you can see we are
11:19 - making the transition from the yellow
11:21 - color and then we are moving towards a
11:23 - green color and then again we are moving
11:25 - to the aqua color over here so guys you
11:27 - can use the conic gradient as well if
11:29 - this is the requirement apart from this
11:31 - we can also mention the angles with the
11:33 - degree so guys over here by default the
11:36 - angles that are provided to the
11:37 - different colors are equal over here but
11:40 - we can mention the degrees as well so
11:42 - let's say we provide certain angles in
11:44 - this case so let's say we want the angle
11:46 - of the yellow to be 45° in this case so
11:49 - simply we can set the 45° over here let
11:52 - me just save this file now and try
11:54 - reloading this page once again on the
11:55 - browser so as you can see the yellow
11:57 - color is now spread towards W the 45°
12:00 - angle over here right now so based on
12:02 - your project requirements you can
12:04 - mention the degree of the colors as well
12:06 - and then apart from this you can also
12:08 - have the starting point over here so
12:10 - guys simply we can use the from keyword
12:13 - in this case so basically you can see
12:15 - that this is the starting point from
12:17 - where the colors are starting but you
12:19 - can provide the angle from where you
12:21 - want those colors to start so let us
12:23 - check that as well so before the first
12:25 - color what we can do is let me just
12:27 - remove this angle over here so before
12:29 - the first color simply we use the from
12:31 - keyword and let's say we provide 90° as
12:35 - the starting point from where we want to
12:37 - start this color that is yellow followed
12:39 - by green and Then followed by aqua color
12:41 - let me just save this file now and try
12:43 - reloading this page once again on the
12:45 - browser notice that we have the start
12:47 - point over here right now but when we
12:49 - reload this page as you can see the
12:50 - start Point has changed over here from
12:53 - the right hand side the yellow color is
12:54 - starting now so guys in this way if you
12:57 - want to change the starting point you
12:58 - can use the from keyword over here
13:01 - followed by the angle that you need to
13:03 - provide inside this conic gradient and
13:05 - Then followed by the colors that you
13:07 - want to set so guys in this way you can
13:08 - use the conic gradients as well so these
13:11 - are some of the gradients that you can
13:13 - use in the CSS so we have the linear
13:15 - gradients that we have seen radial
13:17 - gradient and also the conic gradient as
13:19 - well so guys comment in the comment
