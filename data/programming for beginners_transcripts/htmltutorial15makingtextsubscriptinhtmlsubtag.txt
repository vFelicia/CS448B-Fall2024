00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to learn about making text
00:04 - subscript in HTML using the sub tag so
00:07 - guys basically the content within the
00:10 - sub starting tag and the ending tag will
00:13 - be written in the subscript so the font
00:15 - size used is the same as the characters
00:18 - surrounding it but is displayed half the
00:21 - character's height beneath the other
00:23 - characters so let us check this with the
00:25 - help of example now in the vs code over
00:27 - here what we will do is we will have
00:29 - another statement inside the paragraph
00:31 - tag so over here we will have the P tag
00:34 - in this case and then we will say this
00:37 - text is subscript over here in this
00:41 - paragraph So guys this is a single
00:43 - statement that we have included inside
00:45 - the paragraph let me just save this file
00:47 - now and try reloading this page over
00:49 - here so as you can see this simple
00:51 - statement is being displayed as a
00:53 - paragraph now what we will do is this
00:56 - particular word that is subscript we
00:58 - want to display it as the subscribe
01:00 - inside this paragraph So guys what is
01:02 - the difference between the subscript and
01:04 - the superscript so previously we had
01:06 - seen that the sup tag can be used in
01:10 - order to display the subscript in this
01:12 - way which is displayed on the top now
01:14 - similarly we will be using the SUV tag
01:17 - in this case in order to display the
01:19 - subscript word on the bottom right of
01:21 - this is word over here so guys let us
01:24 - make these changes in the vs code so
01:26 - what we have to do is so we need to
01:28 - enclose this subscript word between the
01:30 - sub starting and the ending tag so we
01:33 - will simply have the less than symbol
01:35 - and then we will type sub and then we
01:37 - will have the greater than symbol over
01:39 - here and then what we have to do is I'll
01:41 - just cut this ending tag and paste this
01:44 - over here after this subscript word so
01:46 - let me just save this file now and try
01:48 - reloading this page once again so as you
01:51 - can see the subscript is being displayed
01:53 - so it says this text is and then we have
01:55 - the subscript in this paragraph now guys
01:58 - this is the example with one word we can
02:00 - have multiple words as well being
02:02 - displayed as the subscript so what we
02:04 - have to do is we need to include those
02:06 - words within the surf starting and the
02:08 - ending tags so over here we say
02:10 - subscript on bottom so basically we have
02:13 - three words over here as subscript when
02:16 - we save this file now and try reloading
02:18 - this page once again so as you can see
02:20 - subscript on bottom is being displayed
02:22 - as the Subscribe guys the height of this
02:24 - subscript is half the height of the
02:26 - other characters that is being displayed
02:28 - normally in this paragraph but the font
02:31 - size is same whenever the superscripts
02:33 - and subscripts are being displayed in
02:35 - the HTML so guys comment in the comment
