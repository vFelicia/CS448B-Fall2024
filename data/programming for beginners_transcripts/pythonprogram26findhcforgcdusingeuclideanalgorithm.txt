00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to find hcf or gcd using
00:07 - euclidean algorithm so guys the
00:09 - euclidean algorithm is based on the fact
00:12 - that hcf of two numbers divides their
00:15 - difference as well so guys the meaning
00:17 - of HCA for the highest common factor is
00:20 - a number that is the multiple of the two
00:22 - given numbers so guys in this algorithm
00:24 - we divide the greater number by the
00:26 - smaller number and take the remainder
00:28 - and then next we will divide the smaller
00:31 - number again by this remainder and
00:33 - repeat this operation until the
00:34 - remainder is 0 so this will help us in
00:37 - order to find the hcf or gcd using the
00:39 - optimal solution in the Python program
00:41 - so guys for example if we want to find
00:44 - the hcf of 54 and 24 we first divide the
00:48 - number 54 by 24 which will give us the
00:50 - remainder as 6. the quotient in this
00:53 - case will be 2 and now we divide the 24
00:55 - that is a smaller number by 6 that is
00:58 - the remainder that we have found and the
00:59 - remain in this case will be 0 hence 6 is
01:02 - the required hcf over here so guys if we
01:05 - check this operation when X is equal to
01:07 - 54 and Y is equal to 24 we first assign
01:10 - this y value to x value that is X is
01:13 - equal to 24 and then we divide 54 by 24
01:16 - and we find the remainder which will be
01:19 - assigned to this y value so in this case
01:21 - y will become 6 over here the value 6
01:23 - will be assigned to this value that is X
01:26 - and 24 will be divided by 6 and the
01:28 - remainder will be 0 in this case and
01:30 - that is why we have found the hcf which
01:33 - is present in the variable X so guys
01:34 - this is the euclidean algorithm and let
01:37 - us implement this using the Python
01:38 - program in the vs code over here so guys
01:41 - first of all we take two numbers so
01:43 - let's say num1 it is equal to 54 and
01:45 - num2 it is equal to 24 in this case and
01:48 - then what we will do is simply we will
01:50 - have the print statement and we will say
01:52 - hcf of two numbers and then we will
01:56 - display the numbers because the braces
01:58 - and this curly is and then again the
02:02 - third curly braces and then over here
02:04 - these curly braces will be replaced by
02:06 - number one and number two and then the
02:08 - third one will be replaced by the hcf
02:10 - that we are going to find for these two
02:12 - numbers so after the double quotes we
02:14 - have dot followed by format and then we
02:17 - will have num1 comma num2 and then we
02:21 - will call the function that is compute
02:24 - hcf which we are going to Define now so
02:26 - guys this compute hcf it will take two
02:28 - parameters which will be number one and
02:30 - number two in this case which will be
02:32 - assigned to the variables X and Y in the
02:35 - compute hcf function so let me just copy
02:38 - this and what we will do is we will
02:39 - Define this function over here so we use
02:41 - the def keyword followed by compute hcf
02:44 - and it is expecting two parameters that
02:47 - is num1 and num2 will be passed so over
02:49 - here we will take the two variables as X
02:51 - and Y now guys what we have to do is
02:53 - simply we have to go through a loop in
02:55 - such a way that the Y value is not 0 so
02:58 - over here we will say While y in this
03:01 - case so when the Y value is not equal to
03:04 - 0 the control flow will go inside the
03:06 - while loop and then what we have to do
03:08 - is we have to assign the value of y to X
03:11 - and the value of x percent y to Y over
03:15 - here so X comma y it is equal to the Y
03:18 - value will be assigned to X first so we
03:20 - will provide y value over here and then
03:22 - followed by comma and then y will get a
03:25 - value of x percent y so over here this
03:28 - operation that is X percent y will help
03:31 - us in order to find the remainder so
03:34 - Guys these operations that we just saw
03:36 - in our example over here x percent y
03:39 - will give us this remainder and that is
03:41 - what we are supposed to assign it to the
03:43 - Y value so that is what we are doing X
03:45 - percent y will be assigned to Y and then
03:47 - guys finally when the Y value is 0 the
03:50 - hcf will be present in this variable
03:52 - that is X over here so after this while
03:54 - open the control flow comes out of the
03:57 - while loop and the Y value is 0 the
03:59 - return account statement should be we
04:01 - should return the value of x so this
04:03 - value of x will have the hcf value and
04:06 - that value will be printed over here
04:08 - instead of this compute hcf that is the
04:10 - third open and close curly braces over
04:12 - here so guys let me just save this file
04:14 - now and try running this code so we are
04:16 - getting the error that is syntax error
04:18 - expected colon so guys over here we just
04:20 - forgot to provide a colon while defining
04:23 - the function over here so guys let me
04:25 - just save this file now and try running
04:26 - this code once again as we can see hcf
04:29 - of two numbers 54 and 24 is 6 over here
04:32 - and that is what we were expecting that
04:34 - the hcf of these two numbers is 6 over
04:37 - here so 6 multiplied by 9 gives us 54
04:40 - and 6 multiplied by 4 gives us 24. now
04:43 - guys let us say we have two numbers as
04:45 - 48 and 24 over here so what will be the
04:48 - highest common factor so it should be 24
04:51 - because 24 exactly divides the number
04:54 - itself that is 24 and then 48 divided by
04:57 - 24 gives us the quotient 2 and the
04:59 - remainder 0 so 24 should be the highest
05:02 - common factor so let me just save this
05:04 - and now and try running this code once
05:06 - again so as we can see hcf of two
05:08 - numbers 48 and 24 is 24. now guys let us
05:12 - say we provide 100 and 200 so what will
05:14 - be the hcf in this case let me just save
05:17 - this file now and try running this code
05:18 - so as we can see hcf of two numbers 100
05:21 - and 200 it is 100 over here that's
05:24 - because 100 divides the numbers itself
05:26 - that is 100 and 200 divided by 100 also
05:29 - gives us the remainder as zero now guys
05:31 - what if the number is 400 and 200 over
05:34 - here so when we have number one is 400
05:36 - and number 2 is 200 what will be the hcf
05:39 - comment in the comment section below let
