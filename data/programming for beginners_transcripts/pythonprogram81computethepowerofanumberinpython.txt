00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to write Python program to compute
00:04 - the power of a number so guys we can
00:07 - easily find the power of a number by
00:09 - using multiple ways as you can see the
00:12 - first way is by using the while loop the
00:14 - second way is by using the pow function
00:16 - that we are going to see with the help
00:18 - of example and then the Third Way is by
00:20 - using the for Loop so guys how does this
00:23 - Computing of the power of a number works
00:26 - so for example if let's say the number
00:28 - that is the base number is 3 and the
00:30 - exponent number is 4 then we have to
00:32 - multiply the space number four times so
00:35 - the result will be 3 raised to 4 which
00:38 - is equal to 81 which is just the
00:40 - multiplication of this number that is
00:42 - base is equal to 3 by itself 4 number of
00:45 - times so guys let us check this in the
00:48 - vs code how we can compute the power of
00:50 - a number so guys over here we are going
00:52 - to define the base that is the number 3
00:54 - in this case and then we have the
00:56 - exponent that will be equal to 4 again
00:58 - so we are going to use the the same
01:00 - example as we have seen the result we
01:03 - are going to initialize it as one so
01:05 - guys by using the while loop we can
01:07 - easily find what will be the result of
01:09 - the power that is 3 raised to 4 over
01:11 - here so in the while loop we are going
01:12 - to check whether exponent is not equal
01:15 - to zero so one at a time we are going to
01:17 - decrement the value of exponent and then
01:20 - inside this while loop what we have to
01:22 - do is we need to use the result it is
01:25 - equal to the result multiplied by the
01:28 - number that is base over here so guys
01:30 - initially what we are doing is this
01:32 - result that is 1 multiplied by 3 it will
01:34 - give us 3 in this case and then it will
01:36 - be assigned to this variable that is
01:38 - result in this case so 3 raised to 1 it
01:40 - is 3 and then we need to decrease the
01:43 - exponent value so exponent it is equal
01:45 - to exponent minus 1 you can also use the
01:48 - shorthand method that is exponent minus
01:51 - equal to 1. so if we use that what we
01:53 - have to do is we have to provide minus
01:55 - and Then followed by equal to and then
01:57 - one so guys this is the shorthand method
01:59 - in order to decrement a value the same
02:02 - way we can also use for the
02:04 - multiplication expression as well so
02:06 - guys next time the exponent value will
02:07 - be 3 so again the result which was 3
02:10 - will be multiplied by the base number
02:12 - that is 3 which will give us 9 and then
02:14 - the exponent will be 2 again after
02:16 - decrementing the value so it is not
02:18 - equal to 0 so the result will be 9
02:20 - multiplied by 3 which is equal to 27 and
02:23 - then next time the exponent value will
02:25 - be 1 and then since it is not equal to 0
02:28 - again the 27 result will be multiplied
02:30 - by the base number that is 3 which will
02:32 - give us 81 and then the last step is
02:35 - exponent minus 1 which is equal to 0
02:37 - this time so the control flow sees that
02:40 - the exponent value is 0 this time so it
02:42 - should come out of this while loop now
02:44 - after coming out of this while loop we
02:46 - can simply print the value of the result
02:49 - so over here we say result and Then
02:51 - followed by colon and then we can simply
02:53 - provide result in this case so the
02:56 - answer is present in the result variable
02:58 - over here so let me just save this file
02:59 - now and try running this code as you can
03:02 - see we are getting the result as 81. now
03:04 - guys what if we change the numbers over
03:06 - here let's say 4 raised to 3 we need to
03:09 - find the result of this which should be
03:11 - equal to 64 this time so let me just
03:13 - save this file now and try running this
03:15 - code so as you can see result is equal
03:17 - to 64. so basically you can have any
03:19 - base and exponent numbers over here the
03:22 - same logic will be applied and the
03:24 - answer will be found out what will be
03:26 - the result when base is equal to 10 and
03:28 - exponent is equal to 2 comment in the
03:30 - comment section below let us see whether
03:32 - your answer is correct or not now guys
03:34 - let us move to another way we can also
03:36 - use the pow function in order to find
03:39 - the power of a number so let us take the
03:41 - same example over here when we say base
03:43 - is equal to 3 and power is equal to 4 we
03:46 - don't have to use the Y Loop in this
03:48 - case so I'll just remove these lines of
03:50 - code over here and then simply what we
03:52 - can do is we can have the result label
03:55 - in the print function and then we can
03:57 - use pow function as you can see we s
04:00 - code is suggesting us this pow function
04:02 - over here we are going to use this and
04:04 - then it will take two parameters over
04:06 - here the base which is the base variable
04:09 - in this case so we are going to provide
04:11 - the base variable followed by comma and
04:13 - then the exponent variable which is the
04:15 - second parameter being expected by the
04:18 - pow function over here so Guys these are
04:20 - the two parallel parameters that are
04:21 - being expected by the pow function let
04:24 - me just save this file now and try
04:25 - running this code once again so as you
04:27 - can see result is equal to 81 by using
04:30 - the pow function so instead of
04:32 - implementing our own logic we can also
04:34 - use this built-in method in order to
04:37 - find the power of a number guys let us
04:39 - take another example what will be the 5
04:42 - raised to 3 expression over here so when
04:44 - base is equal to 5 and exponent is equal
04:46 - to 3 what will be the output let me just
04:48 - save this file now and try running this
04:50 - code so it is equal to 125 that's
04:53 - because 5 multiplied by 5 is 25 and then
04:56 - the result that is 25 multiplied by 3 it
04:58 - is equal to 125 over here so guys this
05:01 - is another method in order to find the
05:03 - power of a number now guys moving to the
05:05 - last method you can see we can also use
05:08 - the for Loop now this is similar to the
05:10 - while loop implementation that we had
05:12 - just seen so consider this as a homework
05:15 - for you so that you can practice on your
05:16 - own and let me know the answer in the
05:18 - comment section below when base is equal
05:20 - to 10 n and exponent is equal to 2 then
05:23 - what will be the result of the
05:25 - expression that is 10 raised to 2 let us
05:27 - see whether your answer is correct or
05:29 - not please make sure that you like this
