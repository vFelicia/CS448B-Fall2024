00:00 - so now we will see image hover overlay
00:02 - in CSS so guys basically we will create
00:05 - an overlay effect on image hover using
00:08 - CSS with the help of examples so let us
00:11 - move to the vs code over here and simply
00:13 - we are going to remove the previous
00:15 - lines of code that we have return in the
00:18 - HTML and the CSS files now guys over
00:21 - here we will Define the diff tag with
00:23 - the class container and inside this
00:25 - container we are going to have the image
00:27 - so let us provide certain sample image
00:30 - over here that I have already downloaded
00:32 - that is the sample Forest image.jpg file
00:35 - which is present in the same directory
00:37 - where this HTML file is present and then
00:40 - guys for the alt attribute simply we are
00:42 - going to say test image this text will
00:44 - be displayed when the image is not
00:46 - getting displayed properly on the
00:48 - browser now guys apart from this we will
00:50 - also Define certain CSS properties for
00:53 - this IMG tag over here inside the CSS
00:55 - file so let's say we have the IMG tag in
00:59 - this case and simply we are going to set
01:01 - the width as 300 pixels and also the
01:03 - height as 300 pixels over here let me
01:06 - just save this file now and try
01:08 - reloading this page on the browser so as
01:10 - you can see this is the image that is
01:12 - getting displayed right now now guys
01:14 - what we are going to do is when we get
01:16 - the mouse cursor on this image we need
01:18 - to get another diff tag that will be
01:21 - displayed on top of this image with a
01:23 - certain background color and a sample
01:25 - text so guys let us move to the vs code
01:27 - over here and simply inside the HTML
01:30 - file we are also going to define the
01:33 - diff tag with the class that is text
01:35 - over here and simply we will have the
01:37 - sample text that is Hello World in this
01:39 - case so guys basically this text will be
01:41 - displayed with the help of the
01:42 - background color on top of the image
01:45 - that we have already displayed on the
01:47 - web browser let me just save this file
01:49 - now and try reloading this page as you
01:51 - can see currently we are simply getting
01:53 - the text at the bottom of this image
01:55 - right now so guys we are going to set
01:57 - certain CSS properties so first of all
01:59 - we will use the container class over
02:01 - here for the div tag and simply we are
02:03 - going to use it inside the CSS file so
02:06 - for this container diff tag we will set
02:09 - the position equal to relative over here
02:11 - and then after this we need to have the
02:14 - position equal to Absolute for the IMG
02:16 - tag as well so over here we will say
02:18 - absolute and also we will set the CSS
02:22 - property for this diff tag as well so we
02:24 - will use the text class in this case and
02:27 - inside the CSS file we use this class
02:29 - name that is text for which the position
02:32 - must be equal to Absolute so guys we
02:34 - have set the position equal to Absolute
02:36 - for IMG tag and the diff tag that is
02:38 - having the class name that is text over
02:41 - here now apart from this we will also
02:43 - set the top and the left CSS property as
02:46 - zero over here for the diff tag that is
02:49 - having the class text let me just save
02:51 - this file now and try reloading this
02:53 - page so as you can see the text is now
02:55 - getting displayed on top of the image
02:57 - right now now guys apart from this we we
03:00 - also want to set the width and height
03:02 - for this particular diff tag that is
03:04 - text over here so simply we will set the
03:07 - width as 300 pixels which is same as the
03:09 - width of image and also the height must
03:12 - be same as that of the image so again we
03:14 - will set the height as 300 pixels over
03:17 - here apart from this we will also set
03:19 - the background color as well so let's
03:21 - say we have the background color as Aqua
03:23 - in this case so let me just save this
03:25 - file now and try reloading this page
03:27 - once again on the browser as you can see
03:30 - the diff tag is now completely covering
03:32 - the image that we have displayed now
03:34 - guys we also want the hello world text
03:37 - to be displayed at the center of this D
03:39 - tag so what we can do is simply we will
03:42 - use the text align CSS property and set
03:44 - the value as Center which will help us
03:47 - in order to get the text at the center
03:49 - of the diff tag as far as horizontal
03:52 - alignment is concerned so we have got
03:54 - the text over here and then in order to
03:56 - get the text at the center of this St
03:58 - tag we can simply use the line height
04:01 - CSS property so over here we can set the
04:03 - line height to 300 pixels which is the
04:06 - actual height of the diff tag so over
04:09 - here we have set the value of line
04:11 - height as 300 pixels let me just save
04:13 - this file now and try reloading this
04:15 - page once again on the browser so as you
04:17 - can see we have CAU the text that is
04:20 - hello world at the center of the diff
04:22 - tag now guys what we want to do is when
04:24 - we get the mouse cursor on the image
04:27 - that is behind this D tag we need to
04:29 - make the this diff tag visible so we can
04:31 - see the overlay effect so in this case
04:34 - simply we are going to set the opacity
04:37 - equal to zero right now so that by
04:39 - default the diff tag that is having the
04:42 - text class is not getting displayed so
04:44 - let me just save this file now and try
04:46 - reloading this page so as you can see we
04:48 - get the image that is getting displayed
04:50 - on the web browser now guys what we have
04:52 - to do is simply we have to use the
04:54 - container class over here so we will use
04:57 - this class in this case and we need to
04:59 - use use the sudo class that is over
05:01 - right now so when we get the mouse
05:03 - cursor on this diff tag we need to get
05:06 - the other diff tag that is having the
05:07 - text over here so we need to use another
05:10 - class name that is text in this case so
05:12 - we use dot followed by text so on Mouse
05:15 - over on this particular main container
05:18 - the dot text class that is a diff tag
05:20 - must be displayed so in this case we
05:22 - need to set the opacity equal to 1 so
05:25 - basically it is going to change from
05:26 - opacity equal to 0 to 1 over here and we
05:30 - need to make this transition within 1
05:32 - second so guys basically we will use the
05:34 - transition as well with the CSS property
05:37 - that is opacity and the time period of 1
05:39 - second over here let me just save this
05:41 - file now and try reloading this page now
05:44 - if we get the mouse cursor on the image
05:46 - as you can see we are getting the
05:48 - overlay effect over here which is
05:50 - displaying the hello world text so guys
05:53 - in this way we can simply provide the
05:55 - overlay effect in this case when we get
05:57 - the mouse cursor on this particular diff
05:59 - tag over here which is displaying the
06:01 - image right now so guys based on your
06:03 - project requirements you can also create
06:05 - your own overlay effect on top of the
06:08 - image or any other HTML element as we
