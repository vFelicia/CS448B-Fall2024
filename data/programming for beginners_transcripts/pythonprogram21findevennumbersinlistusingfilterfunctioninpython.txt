00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to find even numbers in
00:06 - the list using the filter function so
00:08 - guys in this program we are going to
00:10 - include some elements inside this list
00:12 - and which are the even numbers inside
00:15 - this list that we are going to check
00:16 - using the filter function over here so
00:19 - as you can see this is the filter
00:20 - function which takes two parameters the
00:23 - very first parameter is the function in
00:25 - this case we have provided the anonymous
00:27 - function that allows us to check whether
00:29 - the given number is a even number or the
00:32 - odd number and the second parameter is
00:34 - the list itself from where one at a time
00:36 - the element will be passed to this
00:38 - Anonymous function so guys let us check
00:40 - this with the help of the vs code over
00:42 - here so basically the very first thing
00:44 - that we will be having is our list so we
00:46 - will name it as list one and let's say
00:48 - we have the top 10 numbers over here
00:50 - inside this list so we will just set all
00:53 - the numbers from 1 up to 10 over here so
00:56 - as you can see we have initialized the
00:57 - list one now guys we can simply use the
00:59 - filter the function in order to find
01:01 - which are the even numbers from this
01:03 - list so basically over here we will be
01:06 - using the filter function as you can see
01:08 - this filter function will take two
01:10 - parameters the very first parameter will
01:12 - be a function that will help us in order
01:14 - to find whether a number is a even
01:16 - number so let's say we provide this
01:18 - function name that is even over here
01:20 - comma we have to provide the second
01:22 - parameter that is list one so guys over
01:24 - here we will provide list one now guys
01:26 - as you can see we are getting some error
01:28 - over here it says E1 is not defined so
01:30 - we have to Define this even function so
01:32 - what we will do is let's say we provide
01:34 - the def keyword followed by this even
01:37 - function it will take one parameter that
01:39 - is X over here so how this filter
01:41 - function Works behind the scenes
01:43 - basically whatever element is present
01:45 - inside this list one one element at a
01:47 - time from this list one will be passed
01:49 - to this even function over here and that
01:52 - will be captured using this x variable
01:54 - and then guys inside this we can simply
01:56 - provide our condition that is if x
01:59 - percent 2 is it equal to 0 which means
02:03 - that when we divide this particular
02:05 - number that is X by 2 whether the
02:07 - remainder is 0 or not and guys the
02:09 - specialty of an even number is that
02:11 - whenever we divide the even number by 2
02:13 - the remainder is always 0 and in this
02:16 - case if this condition gets satisfied
02:18 - then the number that is X is an even
02:20 - number so what we will do is after this
02:22 - colon we will simply provide return true
02:25 - in this case and then guys when this
02:27 - function that is E1 it returns to true
02:29 - then that particular element that was
02:31 - passed to this even function will be
02:33 - returned by this filter function over
02:35 - here and then we can save it inside
02:37 - another list so guys over here after
02:39 - this what we have to do is we have to
02:41 - provide return false as well if this
02:44 - condition is not satisfied that is X
02:46 - person 2 is equal to equal to 0 if this
02:49 - is not satisfied then we will return
02:51 - false over here okay the first letter of
02:53 - the true it should be capital letter and
02:55 - for the false as well we should have the
02:57 - capital F over here so guys this is the
02:59 - functionality of the field data function
03:00 - that is it helps us in order to filter
03:02 - out certain elements now guys what we
03:04 - have to do is we have to store it inside
03:06 - some another list so over here basically
03:09 - we can store it inside the result over
03:11 - here in this case like whatever elements
03:13 - are coming from this even function for
03:15 - which the return value is true those
03:17 - will be stored in the result function
03:18 - and then guys we can simply provide the
03:20 - print function over here so we say print
03:23 - and then we can say A1 numbers are and
03:28 - then colon and then we can simply
03:30 - provide this result but this needs to be
03:33 - converted into the list data type so
03:34 - over here we will use the list function
03:36 - and then we will provide the result
03:38 - variable so guys over here what we have
03:40 - done is the result that we have got from
03:42 - the filter we have just converted it
03:44 - into the list and in the form of the
03:46 - list we are printing it using the print
03:48 - function over here so let me just save
03:50 - this file now and try running this code
03:53 - so as you can see we are getting even
03:55 - numbers are 2 4 6 8 10 and those are the
03:59 - actual even numbers from this entire
04:01 - list so guys this is the way that we
04:02 - have easily used the filter function in
04:04 - order to find the even numbers inside
04:06 - the list now guys can we reduce these
04:09 - number of lines of code that we have
04:10 - written yes instead of calling this even
04:13 - function what we can do is we can
04:15 - provide the anonymous function over here
04:17 - with the same functionality so how do we
04:19 - Define the anonymous function we'll just
04:21 - remove this function name and then we
04:23 - will provide Lambda and then this
04:25 - Anonymous function will take one
04:26 - parameter that is X similar to how we
04:28 - had given the parameter to this even
04:30 - function and Then followed by colon and
04:33 - then we can simply provide the condition
04:34 - that is X percent 2 the same condition
04:37 - we need to provide is it equal to 0 and
04:41 - if this condition is true then that
04:43 - particular element will be included in
04:45 - the result or else if it is not true
04:47 - then it will not be included in the
04:48 - result and then guys we can simply
04:50 - remove this definition of the even
04:52 - function over here so as we you can see
04:54 - we have just reduced the number of lines
04:55 - of Code by using the anonymous function
04:58 - inside the filter function over here so
05:00 - let me just save this file now and try
05:02 - running this code once again so as you
05:04 - can see we are getting the same output
05:05 - that is even numbers are and then we are
05:07 - getting 2 4 6 8 and then 10. okay
05:10 - similarly we can also remove this list
05:12 - one variable that we have used and
05:14 - provide the range function over here so
05:16 - instead of having this list 1 we can
05:18 - provide range function and let's say the
05:21 - numbers that we want to include are 1 up
05:24 - to 20. so the second parameter inside
05:26 - the range function should be plus 1 so
05:28 - it should be 21 so guys basically the
05:30 - first parameter will be included that is
05:32 - the number one but the second parameter
05:34 - will not be included that is 21 so a
05:36 - number that is less than 21 which is 20
05:38 - will be included so basically we are
05:40 - providing the list of the numbers that
05:42 - is 1 to 20 and from that list the even
05:45 - numbers will be displayed over here so
05:47 - we can simply remove this list one
05:49 - variable as well and then we can simply
05:51 - have these two lines of statement over
05:53 - here in order to find the even numbers
05:55 - inside the list which includes 1 to 20
05:58 - numbers so let me just save this file
06:00 - now and try running this code once again
06:02 - as you can see we are getting the even
06:04 - numbers that are 2 4 6 8 10 and then we
06:07 - also have 12 14 16 18 and then 20. so
06:11 - guys this is the way just by using one
06:13 - simple line of code over here we were
06:15 - successfully able to find out which are
06:17 - the even numbers inside the list now
06:19 - guys what happens if we directly provide
06:21 - this result to the print statement
06:22 - instead of converting it into this list
06:24 - so let us check that as well so over
06:27 - here what I'll do is I'll just remove
06:28 - this list function and I'll simply
06:30 - provide the result variable over here
06:32 - let me just save this file now and try
06:34 - running this code as you can see it says
06:36 - even numbers are and then we are getting
06:38 - this filter object add so basically we
06:40 - are getting the address of this result
06:42 - object over here that was passed by the
06:44 - filter function so it is not working
06:46 - over here we have to necessarily convert
06:49 - this result variable into a list
06:50 - variable in order to successfully render
06:53 - the results so we simply have to provide
06:55 - the list function over here and enclose
06:58 - this result variable so let me just save
07:00 - this file now and try running this code
07:01 - once again so now we are getting the
07:03 - exact even number that are present
07:05 - inside the list guys what do you think
07:07 - about this number that is 21 whether it
07:09 - is an even number or the odd number
07:11 - comment in the comment section below let
07:13 - us see whether your answer is correct or
07:15 - not please make sure that you practice
07:16 - on your own so that on different inputs
07:18 - you get different outputs make sure that
