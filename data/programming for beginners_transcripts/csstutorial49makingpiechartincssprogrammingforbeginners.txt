00:00 - so now we will see how we can make a pie
00:02 - chart in CSS so guys basically we can
00:05 - easily make the pie chart in CSS using
00:07 - the conic gradient for the background
00:10 - image CSS property so guys previously we
00:12 - have seen how we can use the conic
00:14 - gradient and apart from that we have
00:16 - also seen the linear gradient and the
00:18 - radial gradient for the background image
00:20 - CSS property if you have not watched
00:23 - that video you can check the playlist of
00:25 - the CSS tutorial the link I have given
00:27 - in the description section below so guys
00:29 - basically we have seen that the conic
00:31 - gradient help us in order to have the
00:33 - gradient color being rotated from the
00:35 - center point so guys over here we are
00:38 - going to use that property of the conic
00:40 - gradient in order to make the pie chart
00:42 - in CSS so guys this is the example that
00:44 - we are going to make use of different
00:46 - colors and we will be providing the
00:48 - angle for those colors as well so let us
00:50 - check this with the help of example in
00:52 - vs code over here let me just remove the
00:54 - previous lines of code that we had
00:56 - written and then guys inside the HTML
00:58 - file what we are going to do is we are
01:00 - going to have the div tag over here
01:02 - which will be a square div tag in this
01:04 - case so we are going to Define certain
01:07 - CSS properties over here so let's say we
01:09 - provide the width as 300 pixels in this
01:12 - case also the height as 300 pixels since
01:15 - we want to have the Square D tag over
01:17 - here out of which we are going to make a
01:19 - pie chart in CSS so guys we have the
01:22 - width and height over here in this case
01:24 - let us also have the background color
01:26 - for now which we are going to comment
01:28 - out later on so let's say we have the
01:30 - color as Aqua over here also we will
01:32 - provide the border of let's say 2 pixels
01:35 - solid border with the color that is
01:37 - black in this case let me just save this
01:39 - file now and try reloading this page on
01:41 - the browser so as you can see this is
01:42 - the diff tag with the width and height
01:45 - that we have set over here so guys what
01:47 - we have to do is instead of using the
01:48 - background color over here we have to
01:50 - use the background image so let me just
01:52 - comment out this line of code and simply
01:55 - we are going to say background image in
01:57 - this case so guys for this background
01:59 - image we we have to use the conic
02:01 - gradient over here so we say conic
02:03 - hyphen gradient in this case and Then
02:05 - followed by open and close parenthesis
02:07 - so guys using the conic gradient will
02:09 - help us in order to provide the gradient
02:12 - color from the center point and rotate
02:14 - it in the clockwise Direction so guys
02:16 - let us check the example of that so let
02:18 - me just set the first color as blue
02:20 - color over here and second color as the
02:22 - yellow color the third color is the
02:24 - green color and fourth color is the red
02:27 - color over here so guys we have the four
02:29 - basic colors blue yellow green red let
02:31 - me just save this file now and try
02:33 - reloading this page once again on the
02:35 - browser so as you can see we are
02:37 - starting from this particular point over
02:39 - here the first color is the blue color
02:41 - and then we have the smooth transition
02:42 - towards the yellow color over here and
02:44 - then again we have the transition
02:46 - towards green color followed by the
02:48 - transition towards the red color so it
02:50 - is the sequence in which we have
02:52 - provided the colors over here inside the
02:55 - coric gradient now guys how do we make a
02:57 - pie chart out of this Square shaped div
02:59 - element so first of all we need to
03:01 - convert the square shape to the circle
03:03 - shape so what we can do is simply we can
03:06 - use the Border radius over here and if
03:08 - you have seen my previous videos we have
03:10 - the Border radius equal to 50% that will
03:13 - help us in order to have the HTML
03:16 - element in a circle shape only when the
03:19 - width and height values of that
03:20 - particular HTML element are same so guys
03:23 - basically we need to have the width and
03:25 - height to be same in order to have the
03:27 - circular shape with the help of the
03:29 - Border radius equal to 50% let me just
03:31 - save this file now and try reloading
03:33 - this page once again on the browser so
03:35 - as you can see we have the circular
03:37 - shape over here for this particular Dev
03:39 - element now guys we don't want this
03:41 - particular smooth transition that is
03:43 - happening between colors so what we can
03:45 - do is simply we can provide the starting
03:47 - and the ending point for these colors so
03:49 - first of all the blue color it is
03:51 - starting from 0° and then it is ending
03:53 - at 45° so we need to provide comma and
03:56 - then simply we have to provide blue
03:58 - again and then we we will say 90° over
04:01 - here so guys basically it is 90° and not
04:03 - 45° so basically it will be the 1
04:06 - quarter of this particular Circle over
04:08 - here right now and Then followed by
04:10 - again yellow color which is starting
04:12 - from 90° from where the blue color got
04:15 - over and then followed by once again the
04:17 - yellow color which should get over at
04:19 - 180° right now so we have 180° in this
04:22 - case let me just save this file now and
04:23 - see how the changes will look like so
04:25 - when we reload this page so there are no
04:27 - changes right now let me just complete
04:29 - this code over here we have the green
04:31 - color which should start from the 180°
04:34 - right now so we have 180° for the green
04:36 - color and again we have green color over
04:39 - here so we will say green color followed
04:41 - by 270° so we have 270° and then we have
04:46 - the red color over here so we need to
04:48 - have comma as well so we have red color
04:50 - followed by 270° from where it should
04:53 - start and then it should end at 360° so
04:56 - we have red color followed by 360°
04:59 - things over here so let me just save
05:01 - this file now guys over here we have
05:02 - done a mistake we have provided the
05:04 - space character over here so always
05:06 - remember that when we are providing the
05:08 - angles we need to provide the space
05:10 - character after the color but not in
05:13 - between the value and the D string over
05:16 - here so you need to remember this let me
05:18 - just save this file now and try
05:20 - reloading this page once again on the
05:21 - browser so as you can see this is the
05:23 - perfect pie chart and all the colors are
05:26 - taking the 1/4 area for this particular
05:28 - Circle we have the blue color followed
05:30 - by the yellow color then we have green
05:32 - color and then we have the red color so
05:34 - guys no longer we are having the smooth
05:36 - transitions over here in between the
05:38 - colors because we have provided the
05:40 - strict angles over here the starting and
05:43 - the ending angles right now so guys we
05:45 - can change these angles as well so
05:47 - instead of having the 90° for the blue
05:49 - color we can end it at 45° which should
05:52 - be somewhere over here that is the half
05:54 - of the quarter of this particular pie
05:56 - chart and then we can start the yellow
05:58 - color from that particular point so we
06:00 - have 45° over here from where the yellow
06:02 - color should start so let me just save
06:04 - this file now and try reloading this
06:06 - page once again on the browser so as you
06:08 - can see the blue color is starting at
06:10 - the 0o Dee and then it is ending at the
06:13 - 45° and then the yellow color is
06:15 - starting from the 45th Dee and then it
06:18 - is ending at the 180° over here so guys
06:20 - in this way based on your requirements
06:22 - you can provide the different angles for
06:25 - the different colors that you want to
06:26 - set inside your pie chart so guys in
06:29 - this way you can can easily create the
06:30 - pie chart by using the conic gradient
06:33 - for the background image CSS property
06:35 - apart from this you can also display the
06:37 - Legends for this particular pie chart
06:39 - along with the different values that
06:41 - those Legends represent so guys comment
