00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to convert kilometers to
00:06 - miles so guys easily we can convert the
00:08 - distance from kilometers to miles or
00:10 - vice versa by using the conversion rates
00:13 - so while converting the kilometers to
00:15 - miles there is a conversion rate of 0.6
00:19 - to 1371 so guys this is the conversion
00:21 - rate so basically when we provide one
00:24 - kilometer it is equal to so many miles
00:26 - so we can simply multiply the kilometers
00:28 - with this particular number that we have
00:31 - to get the distance in miles and
00:33 - similarly for converting the miles to
00:35 - kilometers we have the conversion rate
00:37 - of this number that is
00:39 - 1.60934 so guys let us first check how
00:42 - we can convert the kilometers to miles
00:44 - over here so let us move to the vs code
00:46 - over here so what we will do is we will
00:48 - ask the user in order to enter the
00:51 - distance in kilometers so over here we
00:53 - can simply provide km as the variable
00:56 - name followed by equal to and then what
00:58 - we can do is we can provide the input
01:00 - function and we will ask the user to
01:03 - enter distance in kilometers now guys
01:07 - the kilometer distance can be a float
01:09 - value as well instead of an integer so
01:12 - what we have to do is this number that
01:14 - will be provided by the user will be of
01:16 - the string data type so we have to
01:17 - convert it to the flow data type so what
01:19 - we will do is before this input we will
01:22 - provide float function and then the
01:24 - entire input needs to be enclosed within
01:26 - the float function so what this thing
01:28 - will do is it will convert the input
01:30 - that is entered by the user to the float
01:32 - number and the float number will be
01:34 - assigned to this km variable which will
01:36 - be kilometers now guys what we have to
01:38 - do is we can simply provide miles over
01:41 - here it is equal to we can say km
01:43 - followed by multiplication and then we
01:46 - can simply provide this conversion rates
01:48 - over here just copy this conversion rate
01:50 - and paste this over here so basically
01:52 - one kilometer it is equal to so many
01:55 - miles over here and similarly whatever
01:57 - kilometer we put it will be multiplied
01:59 - by this convert version rate and then it
02:01 - will be assigned to the miles so guys
02:03 - what we can do is we can simply provide
02:04 - the print function and then we can say
02:07 - distance of and then we will provide the
02:10 - number that is entered by the user as
02:12 - the input which will be stored in the km
02:14 - and Then followed by we say kilometers
02:17 - over here so we have kilometers followed
02:20 - by S and then again the distance is
02:22 - miles over here in this case so we will
02:24 - provide this variable as the second
02:26 - parameter which will be displayed over
02:28 - here instead of this curly braces and
02:30 - then after this we will have miles over
02:32 - here and then after this ring we will
02:34 - provide format and we will provide both
02:36 - these variables that is KM for
02:38 - kilometers which will be displayed over
02:40 - here and then the miles variable as the
02:42 - second parameter the value for which
02:44 - will be displayed over here instead of
02:46 - curly braces so what we have to do is we
02:48 - provide km followed by miles in this
02:51 - case so guys this is the very easy way
02:52 - in order to convert the kilometers to
02:54 - miles so let me just save this file now
02:56 - and try running this code first of all
02:58 - we are going to see what is 1 one
03:00 - kilometer in miles so we provide one
03:02 - kilometer over here and when we press
03:04 - enter simply we will get distance of 1.0
03:08 - kilometers is
03:10 - 0.621371 miles in this case so guys
03:13 - basically we are getting this number
03:14 - since this km value is 1 right now now
03:17 - guys let us say we provide the
03:19 - kilometers as 5 so over here I'll run
03:21 - this code once again and for five
03:23 - kilometers it is how many miles in
03:25 - distance so when we press enter it says
03:27 - distance of 5 kilometers is
03:30 - 3.106855 so guys basically this
03:33 - conversion rate is coming into picture
03:34 - when we are multiplying the kilometer
03:36 - number that is entered by the user now
03:39 - guys similarly we can convert from miles
03:40 - to kilometers that is vice versa by
03:43 - using this conversion rate that is
03:46 - 1.60934 so guys this conversion of miles
03:49 - to kilometers in distance I leave up to
03:51 - you as a homework for you so that you
03:53 - can practice on your own so please
03:55 - practice on your own so that on
03:56 - different inputs you get different
03:58 - outputs make sure that you like this
04:00 - video so that it reaches to more people
04:01 - and subscribe to the channel so that you
04:03 - get the notifications on upcoming videos
04:05 - as well the next video that we are going
04:07 - to talk about is Python program to
04:09 - convert Celsius to Fahrenheit so stay
04:12 - tuned
