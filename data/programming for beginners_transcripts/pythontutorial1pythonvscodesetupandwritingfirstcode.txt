00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video series in which we are going to
00:04 - learn about Python tutorial for
00:06 - beginners so if you are completely new
00:08 - to programming languages and want to
00:10 - start with the Python programming
00:11 - language then this video series is for
00:13 - you and it doesn't matter even if you
00:15 - have learned the other programming
00:17 - languages such as Java C C plus plus and
00:20 - if you are going to learn the Python
00:21 - language for the first time you can
00:23 - watch these videos so that we can get
00:25 - started from the completely beginner
00:27 - level and we reach up to the
00:29 - intermediate and expert level as we go
00:31 - through the different concepts of the
00:33 - Python programming language so guys
00:34 - first of all we are going to check the
00:36 - environment setup using the Python
00:38 - language and we are going to use the vs
00:40 - code as the editor now over here vs
00:43 - stands for visual studio and we are
00:45 - going to use the visual studio code
00:46 - editor in order to write our python
00:49 - programs apart from this vs code setup
00:51 - we are also going to see how do we write
00:53 - the first python code and execute it so
00:56 - guys basically I have written down the
00:58 - steps to install the vs code editor and
01:00 - python interpreter over here so first of
01:03 - all we are going to install vs code
01:04 - using this link that I have already
01:06 - provided in the description section so
01:08 - when you hit this URL in the browser
01:10 - this is the page that is going to open
01:12 - from where you can easily download the
01:14 - visual studio code it depends on your
01:17 - operating system which installer you
01:19 - want to download you can also download
01:20 - for Windows Mac OS and Linux systems
01:23 - over here so it depends on your
01:25 - operating system once you have
01:26 - downloaded this and installed the vs
01:29 - code on your machine the next step is to
01:31 - install python extension in vs code so
01:34 - guys once you have installed the visual
01:36 - studio code this is the get started page
01:38 - that you will see in the visual studio
01:40 - code IDE so over here first of all you
01:43 - are supposed to install the python
01:45 - extension so on the left hand side as
01:47 - you can see there is an extensions
01:49 - button over here on which you can click
01:51 - and then this particular section will
01:52 - open so over here in the search bar you
01:55 - are supposed to type python so once you
01:57 - type python there will be list of
01:59 - extensions that will be available for
02:00 - you so guys this is the extension that
02:03 - you have to install over here so as you
02:05 - can see python intellisense file lens
02:08 - and this is a description that you can
02:09 - see on the right hand side so since I
02:11 - have already installed this python
02:13 - extension on this Visual Studio code I
02:15 - am getting this uninstall button but you
02:18 - will be getting the install button over
02:19 - here if you have not already installed
02:21 - this particular extension now guys this
02:23 - python extension helps us in order to
02:25 - write the python programs very
02:27 - efficiently it allows us to have the
02:30 - code completion feature along with this
02:32 - we can also run the python code and have
02:34 - the output from within the visual studio
02:37 - code itself so guys it is very important
02:39 - extension if you are going to Learn
02:41 - Python and want to write the python
02:43 - programs now guys coming to the next
02:44 - step we have to install the python
02:47 - interpreter using this link that I have
02:49 - already provided in the description so
02:51 - once you open this URL in the browser
02:53 - over here this is the page that will
02:55 - open for you and this is the official
02:57 - website of the Python programming
02:59 - language from where you can download the
03:01 - latest version for Windows over here
03:03 - since my machine is Windows I will be
03:06 - downloading this Python and the latest
03:08 - version is 3.11.1 it might so happen
03:11 - that you are watching this video in the
03:13 - future for which the latest version
03:14 - might be something else so you can
03:16 - download the latest version of the
03:18 - Python interpreter from here apart from
03:20 - this you can also get the links to the
03:22 - installer if you are using some other
03:23 - operating system over here so guys once
03:26 - you have installed python on your
03:27 - machine you can quickly open command
03:29 - prompt so over here in the command
03:31 - prompt you can simply type py followed
03:34 - by double hyphen characters and then you
03:37 - provide version and then when you press
03:39 - enter as you can see python
03:41 - 3.11.1 this is the version of python
03:44 - that is already installed on my machine
03:46 - you might have some separate version but
03:48 - the command will be same in order to
03:50 - check whether the python is successfully
03:52 - installed on your machine now guys after
03:54 - successful installation what you have to
03:56 - do is the last step is to connect this
03:58 - python interpreter in vs code so we
04:01 - select the python interpreter in vs code
04:03 - so over here you have to come on the
04:05 - settings on the bottom left and then
04:08 - over here you can see the command
04:09 - palette you can also have the shortcut
04:11 - keys Control Plus shift plus b if you're
04:14 - using the keyboard keys and then when
04:16 - you click on this on the search bar you
04:18 - have to type Python and then colon and
04:20 - then we have select interpreter so as
04:22 - you can see this is the option and when
04:24 - you click on this as you can see this
04:26 - python 3.11.1 is getting displayed over
04:29 - here which you are supposed to select in
04:31 - order to select the python interpreter
04:34 - now guys what we are doing over here is
04:36 - we are connecting this python
04:37 - interpreter with this virtual Studio
04:39 - code so that whenever we write the
04:41 - python code our program gets executed
04:44 - successfully on the vs code itself now
04:47 - guys it might so happen that you don't
04:48 - get this option that's because you have
04:51 - installed python after installing vs
04:53 - code so you can simply restart this vs
04:55 - code in order to get this option over
04:58 - here and once you select this option and
05:00 - you are ready in order to write the
05:02 - python programs in the vs code IDE so
05:05 - guys just by using these four steps of
05:07 - installation you can quickly get started
05:09 - in order to write the python programs in
05:11 - the vs code and all these steps have
05:13 - been documented in this official
05:15 - documentation of the visual Studio
05:17 - website so you can check the content of
05:19 - this documentation as well the link I
05:21 - have given in the description already
05:22 - now guys we are going to write the first
05:24 - code in Python so what we are going to
05:27 - do is we are just going to close these
05:29 - tabs over here and we are going to open
05:31 - this Explorer over here it is saying no
05:33 - folder opened initially so what you can
05:36 - do is you can create the folder
05:37 - initially in order to organize all your
05:40 - python programs so basically I am going
05:42 - to just create a new folder over here
05:44 - and I'm going to say python so this is
05:47 - the name of the folder and then I'll
05:49 - select this folder over here so as you
05:51 - can see a new folder that is python has
05:53 - been created now you can write python
05:55 - programs inside this python folder you
05:58 - can have any other folder in any of the
06:00 - directories it depends on you where you
06:02 - want to store the python codes that you
06:04 - will be writing from now on so what we
06:06 - will be doing is as you can see this is
06:08 - the icon it says new file so we will be
06:10 - clicking on this new file and let's say
06:12 - I provide the name of the Python program
06:15 - as python followed by underscore and
06:18 - then we have code followed by dot we
06:20 - have p y so guys this is very important
06:22 - that after typing the name of the file
06:25 - we have to append it with DOT py this is
06:28 - the extension of the Python program and
06:30 - this extension will help the vs code in
06:33 - order to interpret that this is the
06:35 - python code and it should execute this
06:37 - code using the python interpreter so
06:39 - guys I am going to press enter over here
06:41 - and once we press enter this python
06:43 - code.py it is going to open
06:45 - automatically over here now simply we
06:47 - can print some content in our Python
06:49 - program as the first code in Python so
06:51 - over here we have something called as
06:53 - print statement as you can see once we
06:55 - type print it is auto suggesting us what
06:57 - are the different keywords that we can
06:58 - use so when we we press enter over here
07:01 - this print gets a selected automatically
07:03 - now inside the open and close
07:05 - parenthesis what we are supposed to do
07:07 - is we can type one particular statement
07:09 - that is the name of the YouTube channel
07:11 - which is programming for beginners which
07:14 - you should definitely subscribe so this
07:16 - is a string that is a statement that we
07:19 - have given over here and this is the
07:20 - very simple Python program that we can
07:22 - write and what this will do is it will
07:24 - simply print this content that is
07:26 - programming for beginners on the console
07:28 - so guys over here you have to come on
07:30 - file and then you can click on save or
07:33 - else you can use the Control Plus s on
07:35 - the keyboard in order to save the file
07:37 - which I am going to do in the upcoming
07:39 - videos as well so first of all you save
07:41 - this file and simply you have to come on
07:43 - this top right corner over here you can
07:45 - see this run python file button over
07:47 - here so when you click on this run
07:49 - python file the terminal will open and
07:51 - it will execute this file that is python
07:54 - code.py that we have simply created over
07:57 - here and as you can see programming for
07:58 - beginner string is getting printed so
08:01 - guys in this way we have written the
08:02 - very first code in the python and using
08:05 - the print statement we have printed the
08:07 - programming for beginners we can print
08:09 - any other statement over here as well so
08:11 - let's say I'll provide this as a
08:14 - statement and then when we save this
08:17 - file and try running this code once
08:18 - again as you can see this is a statement
08:20 - is getting printed over here on the
08:22 - terminal so guys this is the way we can
08:24 - easily set up our python interpreter
08:26 - along with the editor that is Visual
08:28 - Studio code you can use any other editor
08:30 - that you want such as you can simply use
08:32 - the notepad file as well but you will
08:34 - not get such strong features which are
08:37 - provided by the virtual Studio code in
08:39 - the notepad file apart from that you can
08:41 - also use notepad plus plus or we have a
08:44 - very popular ID that is pycharm and
08:46 - apart from that we have many other
08:47 - editors that you can use but vs code is
08:50 - one of the lightweight editors that you
08:52 - can use when you are writing the python
08:54 - programs so guys set up your own
08:56 - environment on your machines and
08:58 - practice on your own in order to write
09:00 - the first code in the upcoming videos we
09:02 - are going to learn a lot about this
09:03 - python programs and what are the basic
09:06 - functionalities what are the different
09:07 - codes that we are supposed to know
09:09 - whenever we will write a complex python
09:11 - programs so guys that's it in this video
09:13 - please make sure that you like this
09:14 - video so that it reaches to more people
09:16 - and subscribe to this channel so that
09:18 - you get the notifications on upcoming
09:20 - videos as well the next video that we
09:21 - are going to talk about is python
09:23 - keywords and identifiers so stay tuned
