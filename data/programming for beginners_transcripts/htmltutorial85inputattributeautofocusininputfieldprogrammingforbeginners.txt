00:00 - so now we will see input attribute
00:02 - autofocus in input field so guys
00:04 - basically the input autofocus attribute
00:07 - specifies that an input field should
00:10 - automatically get focus when the page
00:12 - loads so by default there will be no
00:15 - focus on any of the input Fields when
00:17 - the user loads a particular web page but
00:20 - in case if you want the focus to be set
00:22 - on a particular input field when the
00:24 - user loads the page then you can use the
00:26 - autofocus attribute for that particular
00:28 - input field so guys let us check this
00:30 - with the help of example in vs code over
00:32 - here so I'll remove the previous lines
00:34 - of code that we had written and then
00:36 - guys simply we are having a statement
00:38 - over here that is below content is an
00:40 - HTML form inside the paragraph tag and
00:42 - inside the form what we will do is we
00:44 - will simply have two text boxes that is
00:47 - first name and last name over here so we
00:49 - will say input of the type text in this
00:51 - case and then over here for the name
00:54 - attribute we will say F name and the ID
00:57 - as well we will keep it as F name over
00:59 - here and before this input field we will
01:01 - also have the label tag over here and
01:03 - for the for attribute we will keep the
01:05 - value as F name and then we will say
01:08 - first name in this case followed by
01:10 - colon and then guys similarly we will
01:12 - have the last name as well so we will
01:15 - have couple of line braks first of all
01:17 - after the first name input field and
01:19 - then we will paste this for last name
01:21 - over here so simply we will change the
01:23 - label as last name in this case and we
01:26 - will keep the name value as L name and
01:29 - copy the same value to ID and the for
01:32 - attribute as well so guys we have two
01:34 - text boxes that is first name and last
01:36 - name over here and then after this again
01:38 - we will have couple of line breaks in
01:40 - this case and Then followed by a submit
01:43 - button over here so we have input of the
01:45 - type submit and the value will be submit
01:48 - in this case so that the user is able to
01:50 - submit this form along with the first
01:52 - name and last name data in this case now
01:55 - guys let me just save this file now and
01:57 - try reloading this page on the browser
01:59 - so as as you can see we have the below
02:01 - content is in HTML form and then we have
02:04 - first name and last name over here now
02:06 - guys if you notice there is no focus on
02:09 - any of these two input Fields right now
02:11 - and that is the default behavior of all
02:14 - the input Fields there will be no focus
02:16 - on any of the input Fields by default so
02:19 - what you have to do is let's say if you
02:21 - want the first name to be autofocused
02:23 - when the user loads this particular web
02:26 - page so what we can do is simply for
02:28 - this input field related to first name
02:31 - at the end we can simply say autofocus
02:33 - over here so guys this is one of the
02:35 - attributes that will help us in order to
02:38 - provide the focus to this particular
02:40 - input field when the user loads the web
02:42 - page so let me just save this file now
02:44 - and try reloading this page once again
02:46 - on the browser so now as you can see if
02:49 - you notice automatically the first name
02:51 - input field is getting the focus over
02:54 - here after the user reloads this page so
02:56 - if you want the last name to be focused
02:59 - so simply you can remove this autofocus
03:01 - from the first name input field and
03:04 - provide the autofocus attribute to the
03:07 - last name input field so let me just
03:09 - save this file now and try reloading
03:11 - this page once again on the browser so
03:14 - as you can see last name is now having
03:16 - the focus automatically when the user
03:19 - comes to this particular web page and
03:21 - guys this is the way that you can
03:22 - provide the auto focus on any of the
03:25 - input Fields based on your requirements
03:27 - while you are expecting the user to
03:29 - submit the HTML form it is a best
03:31 - practice to provide the autofocus at the
03:33 - start of the form that is the first
03:35 - input field over here so that the user
03:38 - starts providing the data that is
03:40 - required from his or her side and this
03:43 - is one of the best practices that you
03:45 - can follow so guys comment in the
