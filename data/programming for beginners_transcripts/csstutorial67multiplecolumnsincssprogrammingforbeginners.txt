00:00 - so now we will see multiple columns in
00:02 - CSS so guys basically the CSS
00:04 - multicolumn layout allows an easy
00:07 - definition of the multiple Columns of
00:09 - text just like the text inside the
00:11 - newspapers so guys this we are going to
00:13 - check with the help of examples as well
00:15 - it is very important to note that some
00:17 - of the older browser versions might not
00:19 - support the column properties so it is
00:21 - very important that you test the
00:23 - implementation of these column CSS
00:26 - properties on the various browsers when
00:28 - you are going to deploy your code on
00:30 - production so guys first of all we are
00:31 - going to see what is column count over
00:33 - here which is one of the CSS properties
00:36 - in order to apply the column layout in
00:38 - CSS so let us move to the vs code over
00:41 - here and simply I'm going to remove the
00:43 - previous lines of code that we had
00:44 - written in the HTML and the CSS files
00:47 - over here simply we are going to create
00:49 - a diff tag with the class newspaper over
00:52 - here and above that we are going to have
00:54 - the H1 heading tag and we can say that
00:57 - below is the newspaper so guys over here
01:00 - here we are creating the layout similar
01:02 - to a newspaper over here which will have
01:04 - multiple columns and then inside this
01:07 - let us say we have some random text that
01:09 - is getting generated so over here we are
01:11 - going to create the random text in this
01:13 - case let me just save this file now and
01:16 - try reloading this page on the browser
01:18 - to see how it looks like so as you can
01:20 - see this is the random text that is
01:22 - getting generated over here we are first
01:24 - of all having the H1 tag that is
01:26 - displaying below is the newspaper
01:28 - statement and then we have the simp
01:29 - simple random text that is generated now
01:32 - guys if we want this random text that is
01:34 - generated to be divided into multiple
01:37 - columns in the same web browser so what
01:39 - we can do is simply we can provide the
01:41 - column CSS property to this diff tag so
01:44 - what we have to do is we will use the
01:46 - class name over here and inside the
01:48 - style. CSS file we will provide dot
01:51 - followed by the newspaper that is the
01:53 - class name and simply we can use the
01:55 - column count CSS property so guys this
01:58 - particular column count CS property
02:00 - helps us to specify how many columns we
02:03 - want to divide this particular diff tag
02:05 - to so let's say we want three colums out
02:08 - of this entire text over here so simply
02:10 - we provide the value of three to this
02:12 - column count let me just save this file
02:14 - now and try reloading this page once
02:16 - again on the browser so as you can see
02:19 - these are the column numbers that is
02:21 - three columns can be displayed over here
02:23 - out of the diff tag that we have created
02:25 - now guys apart from this you can also
02:27 - increase the column count so let's say
02:29 - if you want four columns to be displayed
02:31 - let me just save this file now and try
02:33 - reloading this page as you can see this
02:34 - is First Column second column third
02:36 - column and fourth column so the more the
02:39 - number of columns that you are going to
02:41 - increase the Lesser will be the width of
02:43 - each column and that is how the column
02:45 - CSS property will work now guys apart
02:47 - from this there is another column
02:49 - property that is column Gap over here
02:51 - which means the Gap in between both
02:53 - these columns in this case so guys by
02:55 - default we have certain Gap that is
02:57 - provided in between all the columns but
02:59 - but you can modify it with the help of
03:01 - the column Gap so in this case what we
03:04 - will do is simply we are going to
03:05 - provide the column gap of let's say 10
03:08 - pixels over here let me just save this
03:09 - file now you will notice that this
03:11 - particular Gap in between all the
03:13 - columns will get updated over here when
03:15 - we reload this page as you can see the
03:17 - column Gap got updated in this case let
03:20 - us increase the column Gap to let's say
03:22 - 30 pixels over here let me just save
03:24 - this file now the column Gap will
03:26 - increase now in between all the columns
03:29 - so when we read load this page as you
03:30 - can see the gap between all the columns
03:32 - is increased and in this way you can
03:34 - simply use the column Gap CSS property
03:37 - as well apart from this we have
03:38 - something called as column rule style so
03:41 - guys let us check that as well so just
03:43 - like border style CSS property we have
03:45 - something called as column rule style
03:48 - CSS property which will help us in order
03:50 - to provide multiple values over here so
03:52 - as you can see similar to border style
03:54 - values we have the values such as Dash
03:57 - dotted double Groove and so on so simply
04:00 - we are going to provide the solid column
04:02 - rule style over here so guys basically
04:04 - what will happen is a simple line will
04:06 - be displayed in between all these
04:08 - columns over here when we say column
04:10 - rule style that is equal to solid so let
04:13 - me just save this file now and try
04:14 - reloading this page once again on the
04:16 - browser so as you can see this is a
04:18 - simple line that is getting displayed
04:20 - over here and in this case we have
04:21 - provided the solid value apart from this
04:24 - we can also provide the dashed value as
04:26 - well let me just save this file now and
04:28 - try reloading this page so as you can
04:29 - you can see these are the dashed lines
04:31 - that are getting appeared in between the
04:33 - columns so guys this is the way you can
04:35 - set the column rule style over here
04:38 - apart from this you can also set the
04:39 - column rule width and the column rule
04:41 - color so let us check that as well so
04:44 - simply we can say column rule width in
04:46 - this case and let's say we want only the
04:48 - width of one pixel to be displayed as
04:51 - the line in between the columns so let
04:53 - me just save this file now and try
04:55 - reloading this page once again on the
04:57 - browser so there is a very thin line
04:58 - that is getting displayed over here let
05:01 - us increase the width to 10 pixels and
05:03 - when we reload this page as you can see
05:05 - these are the dashed lines that are
05:07 - getting displayed over here in between
05:09 - the columns and let us change the color
05:11 - as well so for color we will have column
05:13 - rule color in this case and simply we
05:15 - will set the color as dark blue over
05:17 - here let me just save this file now and
05:19 - try reloading this page so as you can
05:21 - see this is the dark blue color that is
05:23 - getting displayed over here we can also
05:25 - display some other color so let's say we
05:27 - want yellow color to be displayed so as
05:29 - you can see this is the yellow color
05:31 - column rule that is getting displayed
05:32 - over here now guys apart from all these
05:34 - we can also have the shorthand property
05:37 - that is column over here so instead of
05:39 - providing the style width and color
05:41 - separately we can have the simple column
05:44 - rule CSS property in which case we can
05:46 - provide the width first of all followed
05:49 - by the style that is solid in this case
05:51 - and let's say we want the color to be
05:53 - displayed as gray color over here so
05:55 - simply we can provide the gray color for
05:57 - the column rule let me just save this
05:59 - file now now and try reloading this page
06:01 - once again on the browser so as you can
06:02 - see these are the column rule that is
06:05 - the lines that are getting displayed in
06:07 - between the columns based on the CSS
06:09 - property values that we have provided
06:11 - over here and this is the shorthand
06:13 - property for all the column rule CSS
06:16 - property now guys apart from this we
06:17 - also have something called as column
06:19 - width so guys basically what we have
06:21 - done so far is we have provided the
06:23 - column count over here in which case it
06:26 - was four right now so you can also
06:28 - provide the column in such a way that
06:30 - the number of columns will be calculated
06:33 - automatically so in this case we need to
06:35 - comment out the column count over here
06:37 - and simply what we will do is let's say
06:39 - we want each column width to be only of
06:42 - 100 pixels in this case so when we say
06:45 - column width equal to 100 pixels all the
06:47 - column width that are getting generated
06:50 - over here will have the width of 100
06:52 - pixels in this case and it depends on
06:54 - the content that how many columns will
06:57 - be generated so let me just save this
06:59 - file now and try reloading this page
07:01 - once again on the browser so as you can
07:03 - see we have set the column with as 100
07:05 - pixels over here and due to which there
07:07 - are six columns that are getting
07:09 - generated and if we increase the column
07:11 - width over here so let's say we change
07:13 - the column width to 150 pixels so each
07:16 - column will have the additional width
07:18 - and that is why the number of columns
07:20 - will decrease now so when we reload this
07:22 - page as you can see now we are getting
07:24 - four number of columns and when we
07:26 - increase the withd more so let's say we
07:28 - provide 200 pixel of column width and
07:30 - when we reload this page as you can see
07:33 - now we are getting three columns since
07:35 - the entire content can be displayed
07:37 - within three columns when we have the
07:39 - column width of 200 pixels over here so
07:41 - guys this is the way that you can use
07:43 - the column width as well and the other
07:45 - CSS properties related to column based
07:47 - on your project requirements so guys
