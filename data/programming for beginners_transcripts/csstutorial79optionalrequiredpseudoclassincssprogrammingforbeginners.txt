00:00 - so now we will see optional and required
00:02 - pseudo class in CSS so guys basically we
00:05 - will see how to style the HTML form
00:08 - elements using the optional and the
00:10 - required Pudo class so let us move to
00:12 - the vs code over here and simply I'm
00:14 - going to remove the previous lines that
00:16 - we had return in the HTML and the CSS
00:19 - files over here now guys what we will do
00:21 - is first of all we will Define the diff
00:23 - tag with the class container inside
00:25 - which we are going to have the form over
00:27 - here so before having the form we will
00:29 - have the header tag that is the h2 tag
00:32 - and we will say Feld below form in this
00:34 - case as a heading now guys after this we
00:37 - are going to have the form tag over here
00:39 - and we will have the ID as form in this
00:41 - case and simply we are going to have
00:43 - three Fields over here first of all we
00:45 - will have the username field so we will
00:48 - have input colon text over here so
00:50 - basically it is the input tag with the
00:52 - type text in this case and we will have
00:55 - the name as username and ID as the
00:58 - username value apart from this we will
01:00 - also have the placeholder attribute and
01:03 - we will say enter username so guys
01:05 - basically this is the text that will be
01:07 - displayed by default as a placeholder
01:10 - and then we will make this field as
01:12 - required so that user has to feel this
01:15 - particular field in this case and after
01:17 - this we are going to have certain line
01:19 - braks over here so that the next input
01:21 - is displayed on the next line so I'm
01:24 - going to copy paste this line of code
01:26 - and this time we are going to have
01:28 - password as the text field and again we
01:30 - are going to have the ID as password and
01:32 - we will say enter password over here and
01:35 - it is again a required field in this
01:37 - case and instead of having the type
01:39 - equal to text we will say the type is
01:41 - equal to password over here and then
01:43 - guys apart from this we will have the
01:45 - email field as well so again we will
01:47 - have the type as email over here and we
01:49 - will set the name and the ID as the
01:52 - email values and we will say enter email
01:55 - in this case which is not required over
01:57 - here so we will remove the required
02:00 - attribute from this particular input tag
02:02 - so guys basically we are going to
02:04 - provide the CSS properties with the help
02:06 - of this required or the optional
02:09 - attribute over here so whatever fields
02:11 - we have marked as required will be
02:13 - provided a set of CSS properties and the
02:16 - other fields which are by default
02:17 - optional which means user is not
02:20 - required to provide the data inside
02:22 - those optional field such as the email
02:24 - field over here those will be having the
02:26 - set of other CSS properties and then
02:29 - apart from this we will also have two
02:31 - buttons over here the first button will
02:33 - be the submit button in this case so we
02:35 - will have the input type is equal to
02:37 - submit and the value will be submit over
02:39 - here and also we will set the ID as
02:42 - submit in this case and then apart from
02:44 - this we will also have another button
02:46 - which will have the value as clear over
02:48 - here so guys this is simply for the
02:50 - displaying purpose we are going to have
02:52 - two buttons that is submit and clear
02:54 - inside the form so let me just save this
02:56 - file now and try reloading this page on
02:59 - the browser so as you can see this is
03:01 - the way the form is displayed over here
03:03 - we have the heading first of all Feld
03:05 - below form over here so we need to
03:07 - change this keyword to below form in
03:10 - this case so we have field below form as
03:12 - the header over here and then we have
03:14 - the three fields at is username password
03:17 - and the email Fields over here let us
03:19 - have certain background color for the
03:20 - container class as well in this case so
03:23 - what we will do is we will copy this
03:25 - class name over here and inside the
03:27 - style. CSS file we will have the
03:29 - container class name and what we will do
03:31 - is let's say we have the background
03:32 - color as aqua color over here also we
03:35 - will provide the padding of let's say 20
03:37 - pixels in this case let me just save
03:39 - this file now and try reloading this
03:41 - page so as you can see this is the
03:42 - container that is having the background
03:44 - color over here now guys we will reduce
03:46 - the width of the container to the width
03:48 - of these particular text boxes so what
03:51 - we can do is simply we can set the width
03:53 - it is equal to Min content over here let
03:56 - me just save this file now and try
03:57 - reloading this page so as you can see
03:59 - now now the width is set in such a way
04:01 - that it is only taking up the required
04:03 - space over here apart from this we also
04:05 - want to Center align this particular
04:08 - container so what we will do is simply
04:10 - we can provide margin it is equal to
04:12 - Auto over here so as far as horizontal
04:14 - alignment is concerned we are getting
04:16 - the diff tag at the center of the screen
04:19 - over here now guys how we can provide
04:20 - the CSS properties to these required and
04:23 - the optional attributes that are present
04:26 - inside the form so simply what we have
04:28 - to do is we have to Pro provide the
04:30 - input tag and then we can use the Cudo
04:32 - class over here so let's say first of
04:34 - all we want to provide certain CSS
04:36 - properties to these required fields at a
04:38 - username and password so over here
04:41 - inside the style. CSS file we will say
04:43 - input tag followed by colon and then
04:46 - simply we can say the required keyword
04:48 - so guys this is the way that we can use
04:50 - the Cudo classes over here so basically
04:52 - we need to provide the single colon and
04:55 - then the name of the sudo class so in
04:57 - this case it is the required sudo class
04:59 - class that we are using and whatever CSS
05:02 - properties that we will be including
05:04 - inside this required Pudo class will be
05:06 - applied to all those fields that are
05:08 - marked as required over here inside the
05:11 - form so guys let us check that as well
05:13 - so what we will do is first of all we
05:15 - will provide the padding of five pixels
05:17 - over here let me just save this file now
05:19 - you will notice some kind of spacing
05:22 - inside these username and the password
05:24 - text boxes so when we reload this page
05:26 - as you can see there is extra space that
05:28 - is added over here apart from this we
05:30 - will also provide certain background
05:32 - color so that we can identify the
05:35 - changes that are happening inside those
05:36 - two text boxes that is username and
05:38 - password so what we will do is we will
05:41 - set the background color as green over
05:43 - here and let us change the green color
05:45 - to some lighter version of green color
05:47 - over here so we have this very light
05:49 - green color in this case with the help
05:51 - of the RGB values let me just save this
05:53 - file now and try reloading this page
05:55 - once again on the browser so as you can
05:57 - see we have the light green background
05:59 - color for these required text boxes over
06:02 - here that is username and password apart
06:04 - from this we can also have some more CSS
06:06 - properties that is let's say we have the
06:08 - Border radius of 5 pixels over here so
06:11 - basically the corners of these text
06:13 - boxes will be having the rounded corner
06:15 - so this is the 5 pixels border radius
06:17 - that we have applied over here so in
06:19 - this way based on your project
06:20 - requirements you can provide any CSS
06:22 - Properties by using the required pseudo
06:25 - class in this case now guys apart from
06:27 - this the other field that is enter image
06:29 - which is the email field over here is
06:31 - not having the required attribute so
06:33 - basically by default it is the optional
06:35 - field inside the form so guys what we
06:38 - can do is simply we can Define the input
06:40 - tag followed by colon and then we can
06:42 - have the codo class that is optional
06:44 - over here so whatever CSS properties
06:47 - that we Define inside the optional hudo
06:49 - class in this case will be applied to
06:52 - all the fields that are marked as
06:53 - optional or not having the required
06:56 - attribute so let us provide the same CSS
06:58 - properties in this case that is padding
07:00 - is equal to 5 pixels and Border radius
07:03 - is equal to 5 pixels but this time we
07:05 - are going to change the background color
07:07 - so we will have the version of the red
07:10 - color over here as the background color
07:12 - so let me just change the red color to
07:14 - some lighter version of this red color
07:16 - in this case as you can see this is the
07:18 - RGB value that we have set over here let
07:20 - me just save this file now and try
07:22 - reloading this page once again on the
07:23 - browser so as you can see we have the
07:25 - lighter version of the red color to this
07:27 - field which is not marked as is required
07:30 - but it is the optional field in this
07:32 - case guys if you notice we also have
07:34 - this red color to the submit and the
07:36 - clear button so what we can do is we can
07:38 - provide the CSS properties of username
07:40 - and password to the submit button by
07:42 - using the ID of the submit button so
07:44 - what is the ID of this button it is
07:46 - submit in this case so what we will do
07:48 - is the CSS properties for the required
07:50 - fields are present over here so simply
07:53 - we are going to provide comma and then
07:55 - we will provide the hash character
07:56 - followed by the ID of the input button
07:59 - that is submit in this case so guys
08:01 - basically these CSS properties will be
08:03 - applied to the submit Button as well as
08:05 - the fields that are marked as required
08:07 - over here and in this way we can also
08:09 - provide the multiple CSS selectors so
08:11 - let me just save this file now and try
08:13 - reloading this page once again on the
08:15 - browser as you can see the same CSS
08:17 - selectors that are provided to the
08:19 - required fields are now provided to the
08:21 - submit Button as well and the clear
08:23 - button can have the CSS property that is
08:25 - provided to the optional field over here
08:27 - so guys in this way you can use the
08:29 - required and the optional Cudo classes
08:31 - over here and based on your project
08:33 - requirements you can provide any of the
08:35 - CSS properties inside the codo classes
