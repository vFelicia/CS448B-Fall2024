00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about membership operators in Python
00:05 - Programming so guys in Python in and not
00:08 - in these are some of the membership
00:10 - operators over here and they are used to
00:13 - test whether a value or a variable is
00:15 - found in a sequence now what is a
00:17 - sequence it can be of any data type it
00:20 - can be a string or else it can be a list
00:22 - as well it can be a tuple it can be a
00:24 - set or a dictionary so guys we are going
00:27 - to check this with the help of examples
00:28 - over here as you can see the operator so
00:31 - first operator is n this is one of the
00:33 - keywords that can be used and it belongs
00:36 - to a membership operator so it will be
00:38 - true if the value or the variable on the
00:41 - left hand side is found in the sequence
00:43 - and on the other side that is the
00:45 - opposite of n is not in over here and it
00:48 - will be true if the value or a variable
00:50 - on the left hand side is not found in
00:52 - the sequence so guys basically this
00:54 - membership operators can be used in
00:56 - order to check whether a particular
00:58 - value is present in a particular
00:59 - variable or not so let us check this
01:01 - with the help of examples now so let's
01:03 - say over here I have a very simple
01:05 - string that is Str it is equal to
01:08 - programming for beginners which is the
01:11 - name of this YouTube channel which you
01:12 - should definitely subscribe if you have
01:14 - not done so so guys let's say if I want
01:16 - to find this capital P whether it is
01:18 - present or not inside the string so over
01:20 - here what we will do is we will simply
01:22 - have the print function and inside the
01:25 - parenthesis we will have the single
01:26 - quotes and I will say capital P over
01:29 - here and we will use the membership
01:30 - operator that is in over here as you can
01:33 - see vs code is suggesting us this in
01:35 - keyword over here which is the
01:36 - membership operator now what we will do
01:39 - is on the right hand side of this in
01:40 - keyword we will have the sequence that
01:43 - is Str which is the string object so
01:45 - what we are asking the program is to
01:47 - find whether this P character is it
01:49 - present in this Str string or not so in
01:52 - keyword is being used so let me just
01:54 - save this file and try running this code
01:56 - now if it is present then it will return
01:58 - true or else it will return for over
02:00 - here so I am running this code over here
02:02 - as you can see true is being displayed
02:04 - that's because we have found P right at
02:06 - the start of the string now what if I
02:08 - change this character to a small P so
02:10 - over here I am changing this character
02:12 - to a small case P character over here
02:14 - and guys this is K sensitive so if small
02:16 - p is not found in the entire string then
02:19 - it will be false so let me just save
02:20 - this file and try running this code now
02:22 - so as you can see false is getting
02:24 - displayed that's because we don't have a
02:26 - small p over here in this entire string
02:28 - but we have the uppercase P character at
02:30 - the start of the string so guys this is
02:32 - the functionality of the in operator
02:34 - over here now as you can see in has
02:36 - returned us the false result over here
02:38 - which means this small case character
02:40 - that is p it is not present inside the
02:43 - string what if we reverse this that
02:45 - means what if we use the reverse of this
02:47 - membership operator we will simply do
02:49 - not n over here that means we are
02:51 - checking whether this small p is it not
02:54 - present in this ring yes it is not
02:55 - present and it should return us the True
02:57 - Result so let me just save this file and
02:59 - try and running this code now so as you
03:01 - can see we are getting true over here so
03:03 - guys in and not in membership operators
03:05 - both are opposite to each other if one
03:08 - operator is returning true in one of the
03:11 - conditions so the other operator will
03:13 - return us the false result in the same
03:15 - condition now this example we have taken
03:17 - as far as a string is concerned as I
03:19 - have told you we can also use list Tuple
03:22 - sets and dictionary as well so let us
03:24 - take another example with a list guys in
03:26 - the upcoming videos we are going to
03:28 - learn more about these objects for now
03:30 - you just need to know that what is the
03:32 - syntax of a list if we are defining a
03:34 - particular set of elements so over here
03:36 - let's say I want to have the list of
03:38 - fruits so I will just name the variable
03:40 - as fruits over here and then on the
03:43 - right hand side the way that we Define
03:45 - the list is by using the open and close
03:47 - square brackets over here so as you can
03:49 - see this list is getting suggested over
03:51 - here and that is what we are going to
03:53 - Define now inside this open and close
03:55 - square brackets we are going to have the
03:57 - list of strings having the name of the
03:59 - froze so let's say we have the double
04:01 - quotes first and then we will say mango
04:03 - and then the second fruit let's say we
04:06 - have apple and then the third fruit
04:08 - let's say we have banana and then let's
04:10 - say we have the fourth fruit is orange
04:12 - over here so Guys these are certain
04:14 - fruits that we have defined in our list
04:16 - and the name of the variable is fruits
04:18 - over here now inside this fruits list we
04:21 - need to check whether there is a
04:22 - particular fruit that is present or not
04:24 - so I'll just remove this part inside the
04:27 - print statement over here and let's say
04:29 - I want to find whether inside this list
04:31 - the banana fruit is present or not so we
04:33 - will simply have banana and then after
04:36 - that we will simply have n and Then
04:38 - followed by we will simply put fruits
04:40 - that is the variable name over here so
04:43 - guys this is the list on the right hand
04:44 - side of this in operator and on the left
04:47 - hand side we are providing one value
04:48 - which needs to be found whether it is
04:51 - present inside the fruits variable or
04:53 - not so let me just save this file and
04:55 - try running this code now so as you can
04:57 - see true is getting returned that's
04:58 - because this banana fruit is actually
05:01 - present in the fruit list over here now
05:03 - let us say we provide some another fruit
05:05 - over here let's say we want to find
05:07 - whether pineapple is present in the
05:09 - fruits list or not so we have provided
05:11 - pineapple over here let me just save
05:13 - this file and try running this code now
05:14 - see it is saying false as we can see we
05:17 - have not defined pineapple in our list
05:19 - of fruits and that is why we are getting
05:21 - false over here and if we change the
05:23 - operator that is from n to not n over
05:26 - here so let's say I provide not n and we
05:28 - use the same value that is pineapple let
05:30 - me just save this file and try running
05:32 - this code now so it will be the opposite
05:34 - of false so as you can see through is
05:35 - getting displayed now that's because
05:37 - pineapple is actually not present in the
05:39 - list of rules that we have defined so
05:41 - Guys these are some examples of the
05:43 - membership operators that you will be
05:45 - using in the upcoming videos as well so
05:47 - guys practice on your own so that on
05:49 - different inputs you get different
05:50 - outputs please make sure that you like
05:52 - this video so that it reaches to more
05:53 - people and subscribe to this channel so
05:55 - that you get the notifications on
05:57 - upcoming videos as well the next video
05:59 - that we are going to talk about is if
06:01 - else statement in Python Programming so
06:04 - stay tuned
