00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to find the numbers
00:05 - divisible by another number so guys over
00:08 - here we are going to have a list of
00:09 - numbers and we are going to see which
00:11 - are the numbers inside this list that
00:14 - will be exactly divisible by another
00:16 - number so as you can see this is the
00:17 - list that is having these numbers over
00:19 - here and we are going to see in the
00:21 - output section which of these numbers
00:23 - are divisible by 13 so as you can see
00:26 - numbers divisible by 13 are and then we
00:28 - are going to display those numbers that
00:30 - are divisible by 13 from this list of
00:32 - numbers now guys how do we achieve this
00:34 - so here is the hint we can use the
00:36 - anonymous that is the Lambda function
00:38 - inside the filter function so guys
00:40 - previously we have seen that filter
00:42 - function is used in order to filter out
00:44 - certain values from the list so
00:46 - basically we are going to use that
00:48 - filter function in order to find which
00:50 - are these numbers that are divisible by
00:52 - 13 and we are going to print those
00:54 - numbers and this filter function is a
00:56 - built-in function to find all the
00:58 - numbers that is divisible by by 13 in
01:01 - the list so guys let us check this with
01:02 - the help of the vs code over here so the
01:05 - very first thing that we have to do is
01:06 - we have to define the list that is my
01:08 - list over here and we will simply copy
01:10 - these list of numbers so I'll simply
01:13 - copy this and paste this over here now
01:15 - guys how do we use the filter function
01:17 - simply we have to provide the filter
01:19 - function over here and the very first
01:21 - parameter will be the anonymous function
01:23 - so we will provide Lambda that is the
01:25 - anonymous function and this Anonymous
01:27 - function will take one parameter for now
01:29 - so let's say we name it as X and then
01:31 - what we have to do is we have to divide
01:33 - this number that is X by 13 so X percent
01:37 - 13 whether it becomes a 0 or not so this
01:41 - is the logic so if this number that is X
01:43 - is perfectly divisible by 13 then the
01:45 - remainder will be 0 in this case and
01:48 - this expression will return true and
01:50 - that x value will be returned by this
01:52 - filter function over here so after this
01:54 - we have to provide comma and then the
01:56 - second parameter will be the list object
01:58 - over here so I'll simply copy this and
02:00 - paste this that is the my list variable
02:02 - now guys we can store it inside another
02:04 - result variable over here so whatever
02:07 - results are coming from the filter
02:08 - function these will be stored inside
02:10 - this result object and then we can
02:12 - simply print these results so basically
02:15 - we can have print statement over here
02:17 - and then we can simply say number
02:20 - divisible by 13 R and then colon and
02:25 - then because we have to convert this
02:27 - result variable into the list variable
02:29 - so we can simply have the list function
02:32 - and inside this function we can simply
02:34 - provide the result variable over here as
02:36 - the parameter so that it gets
02:38 - automatically converted to the list and
02:40 - is printed after this string so guys let
02:43 - me just save this file now and try
02:44 - running this code so as you can see
02:46 - number divisible by 13 are 65 39 and 221
02:50 - and that is the result that we are
02:52 - expecting that is 65 39 and 221 which
02:55 - are the numbers that are exactly
02:57 - divisible by 13. now guys we see another
02:59 - number that is 12 over here so let us
03:01 - see which are the other numbers that are
03:03 - divisible by 12 at least one number we
03:05 - have that is divisible by 12 which is
03:07 - the 12th number itself so let me just
03:10 - change this logic over here x person 12
03:12 - is equal to 0 this should be the logic
03:15 - in order to find which are the numbers
03:17 - that are divisible by 12 over here so
03:19 - let me just save this file now and try
03:21 - running this code so as you can see only
03:23 - one number we are getting that is number
03:25 - divisible by 13 are 12 over here I just
03:28 - forgot to change the label so it should
03:30 - be numbers divisible by 12 or 12 in this
03:34 - case so I'll just run this code once
03:35 - again so it is showing numbers divisible
03:37 - by 12 are 2L now guys let us see which
03:40 - are the even numbers out of all these
03:42 - numbers that are present inside the list
03:44 - so in order to find that we can simply
03:46 - provide X percent 2 over here equal to
03:49 - equal to 0 that will help us in order to
03:51 - find which are the even numbers because
03:53 - whenever we divide a number by 2 and if
03:56 - the remainder is 0 that means a number
03:58 - that we have provided is an even number
04:00 - so over here numbers divisible by 2 in
04:03 - this case r and then we can get the list
04:05 - over here so let me just save this file
04:07 - now and try running this code so as you
04:09 - can see 12 54 and 102 all these numbers
04:12 - are divisible by 2 and the other numbers
04:15 - that is 65 that is not divisible then we
04:17 - have 39 again it is not divisible 339
04:21 - and 221 these are also the numbers that
04:23 - are odd numbers and they are not even
04:25 - numbers so guys this is the way we can
04:27 - easily use the filter function in order
04:29 - to find what are the numbers inside the
04:32 - list that is divisible by a specific
04:34 - number that you want to try so guys
04:36 - please make sure that you practice on
04:37 - your own so that on different inputs you
04:39 - get different outputs make sure that you
04:41 - like this video so that it reaches to
04:42 - more people and subscribe to this
04:44 - channel so that you get the
04:45 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
04:47 - the next video that we are going to talk
04:49 - about is Python program to convert
04:51 - decimal to Binary octal and hexadecimal
