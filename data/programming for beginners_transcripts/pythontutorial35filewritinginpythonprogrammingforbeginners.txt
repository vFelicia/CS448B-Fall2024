00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about file writing in Python Programming
00:06 - so guys in Python a file operation takes
00:09 - place in the following order so
00:11 - basically first of all we have to open
00:13 - the file then secondly we can write into
00:16 - the file that we have opened and the
00:18 - last step is to close the file so these
00:20 - are the operations in this order in
00:22 - which we have to follow while writing
00:24 - the content into the file now there are
00:26 - two things we need to remember while
00:28 - writing to a file so first of all if we
00:31 - try to open a file that doesn't exist so
00:34 - a new file will be created in this case
00:36 - so guys we are going to check this with
00:37 - the help of example as well and in the
00:40 - second case if a file already exists
00:42 - then its content is erased and new
00:45 - content is added to the file again so
00:47 - Guys these are the two important things
00:49 - that you should know while writing into
00:51 - the file if the file is not already
00:53 - present then a new file will be created
00:55 - and if the file is already present then
00:58 - the existing content will be most and
01:00 - the new content will be added into the
01:02 - file so guys the first operation is
01:04 - opening the file over here in which case
01:06 - we can use the open method to open the
01:09 - file and this is the example we have the
01:12 - variable on the left hand side and then
01:14 - we have the open method followed by the
01:16 - name of the file over here along with
01:18 - the entire path if it is present in some
01:21 - other directory and Then followed by the
01:23 - second parameter that is W which stands
01:25 - for the right mode so guys let us check
01:27 - this with the help of example now over
01:29 - here so what we will do is we will say
01:31 - file 1 which is the variable name
01:33 - followed by equal to and then we have
01:36 - the open method in this case so we have
01:38 - to provide the name of the file along
01:40 - with the directory path inside the
01:42 - parenthesis and the double quotes over
01:44 - here so what we will do is we are going
01:46 - to use this directory over here in order
01:49 - to create a new file and write the
01:51 - content into the file so guys over here
01:53 - there are only two files that is Python
01:55 - tutorial and test file we are going to
01:58 - create a third file that is out Port dot
02:01 - txt in which we are going to write the
02:03 - content by using the code over here so
02:05 - basically I'm going to paste the entire
02:07 - directory path and in order to avoid any
02:10 - errors I'll just use the double
02:12 - backslashes over here since these are
02:14 - the Escape characters so we provide the
02:16 - double backslashes and then at the end
02:18 - we have to provide the name of the file
02:20 - so I'll simply provide output dot txt in
02:24 - this case and then guys the second
02:25 - parameter needs to be the writing mode
02:28 - so over here inside the double quotes we
02:30 - can say w which means we are opening the
02:33 - file in the right mode in this case now
02:35 - guys we have completed the first step
02:37 - now what is the next step writing into
02:39 - the file so basically writing in a file
02:41 - in a python so after we open a file we
02:43 - use the write method to write the
02:46 - content in the file and this is the way
02:48 - as you can see in this example we have
02:50 - the variable name that is file 1
02:51 - followed by Dot and then we have the
02:54 - right method and then the content that
02:57 - we want to write into the file so guys
02:58 - basically what we will towards on the
03:01 - second line over here we will say file 1
03:03 - followed by Dot and then we have the
03:06 - right method this right method can be
03:08 - used in order to write the content into
03:10 - the file and it takes certain parameters
03:12 - the parameters will be the string or the
03:14 - integer numbers that you want to print
03:16 - or store inside the file so guys let's
03:19 - say I want to provide this is first line
03:24 - in output
03:27 - file
03:28 - so guys this is the content that we want
03:30 - to write into the file and this is the
03:32 - way that we can use the write function
03:34 - in order to write the content into the
03:36 - file and it takes the parameter as the
03:38 - string which you want to store inside
03:40 - the file now after writing what we have
03:42 - to do is we have to close the file so
03:45 - when we are done with performing
03:46 - operations on the file we need to
03:49 - properly close the file closing a file
03:51 - will free up the resources that were
03:53 - tied with the file it is done using the
03:55 - close method in Python so as you can see
03:58 - in this example we have file one dot
04:00 - close so over here we can simply provide
04:03 - file 1 Dot close in this case and then
04:07 - open and close parenthesis it doesn't
04:09 - take any parameters over here so guys
04:11 - let me just save this file now before
04:13 - running this code I'll show you the
04:14 - directory once again we have only two
04:16 - files over here that is Python tutorial
04:18 - and test file we are going to have a
04:21 - third file over here that is the
04:22 - output.txt that will be created after
04:25 - execution of this code so before running
04:27 - this code what I will do is I'll have
04:29 - the print statement so that we get the
04:32 - confirmation that the code is executed
04:34 - so we will say file created
04:38 - successfully
04:41 - so this is the statement that will be
04:43 - printed after all the lines of code are
04:45 - executed so guys let me just save this
04:47 - file now and try running this code so as
04:49 - you can see we are getting file created
04:51 - successfully and if we go inside the
04:53 - directory now as you can see we are
04:55 - getting the third file over here that is
04:57 - the output in this case so if we open
04:59 - this file as you can see this is first
05:01 - line in output file and this is what we
05:04 - have printed by using our program this
05:06 - is first line in output file the same
05:09 - statement is being printed over here it
05:11 - is being stored in our output file and
05:13 - guys this is the way that we have
05:15 - created a new file by using the python
05:18 - code in a particular directory that we
05:20 - wanted and also return the content into
05:23 - the file by using the two methods that
05:25 - is first of all we have used the open
05:27 - function in order to open the file in
05:30 - the right mode and then we have used the
05:33 - write function in order to write the
05:35 - content into the file now guys let us
05:37 - say we have another scenario in the same
05:39 - file we want to update the first line to
05:42 - this is first line and I'll just remove
05:44 - this in output file content over here so
05:47 - we have the short message that is this
05:49 - is first line and then what I will do is
05:51 - we have another statement so again we
05:54 - will have the file one dot right and
05:56 - then we can say this is second line in
05:59 - this case so guys we are having the two
06:01 - lines over here now and this will act as
06:03 - a kind of update now that's because we
06:06 - already have this output.txt file in
06:09 - this directory and now what we are doing
06:10 - is simply we are opening it once again
06:13 - and these lines will be stored in the
06:16 - file and guys remember that while you
06:18 - are opening the existing file what we
06:20 - already saw is the content is erased and
06:23 - the new content is added to the file so
06:25 - basically these two lines will be
06:27 - printed inside the output.txt file and
06:30 - now what we will do is for this print
06:31 - function we will say file updated
06:34 - successfully so guys let me just save
06:36 - this file now before running this code
06:38 - I'll show you that file once again over
06:40 - here we we have the output file I just
06:43 - open this file we are having this is
06:44 - first line in a output file so let me
06:47 - just close this now and what we will do
06:49 - is we will run this code so as you can
06:52 - see file updated successfully we are
06:54 - getting this message will go to the
06:56 - directory to check what is the content
06:58 - so as you can see both the statements
07:00 - are getting printed over here this is
07:01 - first line and Then followed by this is
07:04 - second line now guys what happened is
07:06 - both the lines have continued on the
07:08 - same line but we can have them on the
07:10 - separate lines as well so what we can do
07:12 - is in our code we can simply provide the
07:14 - slashing character at the end of the
07:17 - first line over here so that the control
07:19 - flow goes to the next line while
07:21 - printing this statement that is this is
07:23 - second line so guys let me just save
07:24 - this file and try running this code now
07:26 - once again so it says file updated
07:28 - successfully we come back over here in
07:30 - the directory we open the output file
07:33 - now as you can see this is first line
07:35 - and then we have on the other line This
07:37 - is second line over here so guys in this
07:39 - way we can easily write the content in
07:42 - the file we can also have the multiple
07:44 - lines of content being stored in the
07:47 - file that we opened by using the Python
07:49 - programming language guys this concept
07:51 - of reading and writing the files are
07:52 - very important as far as your project
07:54 - requirements are concerned so please
07:56 - make sure that you practice on your own
07:57 - so that on different inputs you get
07:59 - different output apart from this can we
08:02 - use the with open syntax in order to
08:05 - write a file so you can try this as a
08:07 - homework for you you can watch my
08:08 - previous video as well in which I have
08:10 - explained you how we can use the with
08:12 - open syntax in order to read the file
08:15 - and in which case we don't have to close
08:17 - the file that's because it is
08:18 - automatically handled by this with open
08:21 - syntax for us so please treat this as a
08:23 - homework for you and comment in the
08:25 - comment section below whether you were
08:27 - able to use the with open syntax in
08:29 - order to write into the file please make
08:31 - sure that you like this video so that it
08:33 - reaches to more people and subscribe to
08:35 - this channel so that you get the
08:36 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
08:38 - the next video that we are going to talk
08:40 - about is there directory in Python
08:42 - Programming so stay tuned
