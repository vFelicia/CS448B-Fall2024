00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about while loop in Python Programming
00:06 - so guys previously we have seen how the
00:08 - for Loop works in the Python Programming
00:10 - now the python while loop is used to run
00:12 - a specific code until a certain
00:14 - condition is met so basically in the for
00:17 - Loop there was no such condition that we
00:19 - had provided but it was iterating
00:21 - through a list that we had provided in
00:23 - the form of a variable but over here
00:25 - this is the syntax of the while loop
00:27 - first of all we have the while keyword
00:29 - over here and then we have a certain
00:31 - condition and if this condition is true
00:34 - then only the control flow will go
00:36 - inside the body of the while loop and
00:38 - then again the control flow will come
00:39 - over here it will check the condition
00:41 - again and if the condition is true once
00:44 - again it will again go inside the body
00:46 - of this while loop so guys again and
00:48 - again the control flow will come inside
00:50 - the while loop until unless the
00:52 - condition becomes false so when this
00:54 - condition becomes false the control flow
00:56 - will come out of this while loop and
00:58 - that is how the while loop is going to
00:59 - work in the Python Programming so guys
01:02 - let us check this with the help of
01:03 - examples now so let's say we want to
01:05 - print the first five numbers that is one
01:07 - to five so over here initially we can
01:09 - have the variable that is I it is equal
01:11 - to 1 and the second variable that is J
01:14 - it is equal to 5 so this is the starting
01:16 - point that is I equal to 1 and the
01:18 - ending point is J is equal to 5 so
01:21 - basically we can have a while loop over
01:23 - here we will simply have the while
01:25 - keyword and the condition that we have
01:27 - to give is whether I is less than or
01:30 - equal to J and up to that condition we
01:33 - want to print the value of I so
01:35 - basically it is I less than or equal to
01:38 - J over here so if this condition is true
01:41 - we want to print the value of I which
01:43 - will be 1 initially so basically I want
01:46 - to print this number that is I over here
01:49 - now guys what exactly is happening over
01:51 - here is ice value is 1 initially J value
01:53 - is 5 initially so is I less than or
01:56 - equal to J in the first instance yes in
01:58 - this case so I will be printed which is
02:00 - equal to 1 so again it will go inside
02:03 - the while loop and it will check whether
02:05 - 1 is less than or equal to 5 yes in this
02:07 - case so guys we are not changing any of
02:09 - the values that is I or J over here so
02:12 - this will be infinite Loop because again
02:14 - and again the condition will be true and
02:17 - the number that is I which is equal to 1
02:19 - will get printed indefinitely so what we
02:22 - have to do is we have to increment the
02:24 - value of I because after 1 we want to
02:26 - print the value that is 2 over here so
02:28 - what we will do is we will simply add 1
02:30 - to I so I it is equal to I plus 1 we can
02:35 - also use the shorthand method that is I
02:37 - plus equal to 1 over here so what will
02:39 - happen now is is value is updated to I
02:42 - plus 1 which will be 2 now so is 2 less
02:45 - than or equal to 5 yes in this case and
02:47 - then again 2 will get printed and then I
02:50 - will again get incremented over here so
02:52 - the ice value will be 3 next time ice
02:54 - value will be 4 and then again ice value
02:56 - will be 5 and then ultimately when I is
02:59 - value is 6 this condition will become
03:01 - false that's because 6 is not less than
03:04 - or equal to 5 and the control flow will
03:06 - come out of the while loop so guys let
03:08 - me just save this file and try running
03:09 - this code now so as you can see all the
03:12 - numbers that is 1 2 3 4 5 is getting
03:14 - printed after the is value is 5 over
03:17 - here 5 is getting printed now eyes value
03:19 - becomes 6 over here that's because 5
03:21 - plus 1 will be 6 and is 6 less than or
03:24 - equal to 5 because the chase value is 5
03:26 - over here in this case so no the
03:28 - condition becomes false and the control
03:30 - flow comes out of the while loop now
03:32 - what if we want to print all these
03:34 - numbers on the same line so simply
03:36 - inside the print statement we can have
03:38 - the comma and then we can have the end
03:40 - operator and then let's say we want to
03:42 - separate all the numbers with the space
03:43 - characters so inside the double quotes
03:45 - we have provided the space character
03:47 - over here so let me just save this file
03:49 - and try running this code now so as you
03:51 - can see one two three four five is
03:53 - getting printed over here we can have
03:55 - any numbers over here let's say I is
03:57 - starting from 11 and let's say we want J
04:00 - is equal to 20 so in this case 11 to 20
04:02 - should get printed let me just save this
04:04 - file and try running this code now so as
04:07 - you can see 11 12 13 14 and up to 20
04:10 - numbers are getting printed over here so
04:12 - guys this is the main functionality of
04:14 - the while loop it is going to have a
04:16 - certain condition and if this condition
04:18 - is true the block of code inside the
04:21 - while loop will get executed and once
04:23 - the condition becomes false control flow
04:26 - comes out of the while loop now guys we
04:28 - can also use the else part with the
04:29 - while loop so over here as you can see
04:31 - python while loop with the else part so
04:34 - a while loop can have an optional else
04:36 - block as well the else part is executed
04:39 - after the condition in the while loop
04:41 - evaluates to false so basically after
04:43 - this while loop we can also have the
04:45 - else part which is optional so we can
04:48 - have the else part over here what we
04:49 - will do is we will simply have the print
04:51 - statement that is outside the while loop
04:54 - so we have the print function and we
04:56 - will say outside while
04:59 - Loop over here so let me just save this
05:01 - file and try running this code now so as
05:04 - you can see 11 12 13 up to 20 numbers
05:07 - are getting printed and then on the same
05:09 - line the outside while loop the
05:11 - statement that we have provided in the
05:13 - else part is getting printed so this is
05:15 - the functionality of the else part after
05:16 - the while loop it is optional if you
05:19 - want to have we can have it or else we
05:21 - don't need to have it but guys the
05:22 - important thing is inside the while loop
05:24 - we can provide a particular condition
05:26 - and the control flow will go again and
05:28 - again inside the while loop until the
05:30 - condition is true once a condition
05:32 - becomes false the control flow will come
05:34 - out of the while loop now guys what you
05:36 - should use whether you should use the
05:38 - python for Loop or python while loop
05:40 - over here so guys basically they are
05:42 - used based on the specific requirements
05:44 - so as you can see for Loop is usually
05:46 - used when the number of iterations is
05:48 - known so as we had seen previously in
05:51 - the for Loop we provide a particular
05:53 - sequence and iterate through that
05:55 - sequence by giving one value at a time
05:57 - to a variable and we use that variable
05:59 - inside the block of the for Loop but in
06:02 - the while loop there is a condition so
06:04 - while loop is usually used when the
06:05 - number of iterations are unknown so we
06:07 - don't know the number of iterations we
06:09 - don't have the sequence of elements or
06:11 - the list of numbers through which we
06:13 - want to iterate so basically we provide
06:15 - the condition in the while loop So based
06:17 - on these requirements you can choose
06:19 - whether you want to use the while loop
06:21 - or you want to use the for Loop but guys
06:23 - it is very important that you practice
06:25 - both these Loops the implementation of
06:27 - these Loops are very important as far as
06:29 - Python Programming is concerned so guys
