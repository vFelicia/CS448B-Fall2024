00:00 - so now we will see length units in CSS
00:03 - so guys basically CSS has several
00:05 - different units for expressing a length
00:08 - and many CSS properties take length
00:11 - values such as width margin padding font
00:14 - size Etc and this we are going to check
00:17 - with the help of examples as well that
00:19 - what are the different units that we can
00:21 - provide to all these CSS properties over
00:24 - here now guys length is a number
00:27 - followed by a length unit such as 10
00:30 - pixels over here so when we say 10
00:32 - pixels 10 is the length and pixel is one
00:36 - of the length units inside the CSS apart
00:39 - from this we also have 2 em over here
00:42 - where two is the length and EM is the
00:45 - length unit that we are going to check
00:47 - the that we are going to check with
00:48 - examples as well so guys let us see what
00:50 - are the different absolute lens over
00:53 - here so basically the absolute length
00:55 - units are fixed and the length expressed
00:58 - in any of these will appear as exactly
01:01 - that size over here on the screen that
01:04 - you are viewing your web page so guys
01:06 - let us see how this CM that the ctim
01:09 - will work so let us move to the vs code
01:11 - over here and simply I'm going to remove
01:13 - the previous lines of code that we had
01:15 - written in the HTML and the CSS files
01:19 - now guys what we will do is simply we
01:21 - are going to have the paragraph tag over
01:23 - here and then we will say this font size
01:27 - is in cm so guys basically we have the
01:30 - statement that is this font size is in
01:32 - cm over here and then guys what we will
01:35 - do is we are going to have the class for
01:37 - this particular paragraph and simply we
01:39 - are going to say cm in this case which
01:42 - represents the CM length over here let
01:45 - me just save this file now and try
01:46 - reloading this page on the browser so as
01:49 - you can see we have a very simple
01:50 - statement that is this font size is in
01:53 - cm now guys we have not provided any
01:55 - font size in this case inside our style.
01:58 - CSS file so by by default if you see the
02:01 - font size of this particular paragraph
02:03 - text will be 16 pixels over here so most
02:06 - of the browsers provide the font size of
02:09 - 16 pixels for all the text that are
02:11 - displayed on the web page so guys let me
02:14 - just inspect this particular paragraph
02:16 - tag so as you can see if we scroll down
02:19 - so we cannot see any of the CSS
02:21 - properties for this paragraph tag apart
02:23 - from these default CSS properties over
02:26 - here so guys what we will do is inside
02:27 - our style. CSS file in this case simply
02:30 - we are going to say dot followed by CM
02:33 - that is the class name for this
02:34 - particular paragraph tag and then we
02:36 - will say font size it is equal to let's
02:39 - say we have 16 pixels in this case so
02:42 - guys for test purpose we are going to
02:43 - see whether the font size is going to
02:45 - change or not so let me just save this
02:47 - file now and try reloading this page
02:49 - once again on the browser so as you can
02:51 - see the font size is not updated for
02:53 - this particular paragraph tag and the
02:55 - font size of 16 pixels is now getting
02:58 - reflected under under this inspect
03:00 - option guys you can also change the font
03:02 - size from here so basically you can see
03:05 - that this is 16 pixels in this case you
03:07 - can simply provide 20 pixels over here
03:09 - and simply the font size is going to be
03:11 - updated in this case you can also
03:13 - provide 22 pixels or any of the size
03:16 - over here now guys the important thing
03:18 - is we are supposed to provide the font
03:20 - size in cm so what we have to do is
03:22 - instead of pixels over here let's say we
03:24 - provide the font size as 5 cm that is CM
03:28 - over here in this case so guys let me
03:30 - just save this file now and try
03:31 - reloading this page once again on the
03:33 - browser so as you can see this is a very
03:35 - big font size over here so let me just
03:37 - change the length in this case so let's
03:39 - say we provide 0.5 CM over here let me
03:43 - just save this file now and try
03:44 - reloading this page so as you can see
03:46 - this font size is in cm and you can see
03:49 - that the CM class is having the font
03:51 - size as 0.5 CM let us increase the font
03:55 - size to 0.8 cm over here let me just
03:58 - save this file now and and try reloading
04:00 - this page so as you can see this font
04:02 - size is in cm and the size has increased
04:05 - to 0.8 cm over here so guys in this way
04:08 - this is one of the absolute lens that
04:10 - you can use based on your project
04:12 - requirements now guys apart from this
04:14 - you can also provide the length in
04:16 - millimet so let us have another
04:18 - paragraph over here so simply I'm going
04:20 - to copy this line of code over here and
04:22 - then instead of CM we are going to have
04:24 - millimeter that is MM in this case as
04:27 - the class name and then we will say this
04:29 - font size sizes in mm over here guys let
04:31 - me just save this file now and inside
04:33 - the style. CSS file once again we are
04:36 - going to have the mm class name over
04:38 - here so simply we will have mm in this
04:41 - case and for the font size let's say we
04:43 - have 5 mm over here so guys 5 mm is
04:46 - nothing but it is 0.5 CM so let me just
04:49 - save this file now and try reloading
04:51 - this page once again on the browser so
04:53 - as you can see this font size is an mm
04:56 - and if we inspect this particular
04:58 - paragraph over here it says 5 mm in this
05:00 - case now guys let us update this
05:02 - particular font size to 8 mm which means
05:05 - it will be equal to 0.8 cm so when we
05:08 - say 8 mm so in this case both the
05:11 - paragraph that is having the class that
05:13 - is CM and the mm will have the same font
05:15 - size because 0.8 cm is same as 8 mm over
05:20 - here let me just save this file now and
05:22 - try reloading this page once again on
05:24 - the browser so as you can see the font
05:26 - size of both the paragraph is now
05:28 - looking same and this is this is how you
05:30 - can use the millimeter length unit as
05:32 - well now guys apart from this we also
05:34 - have something called as inches so
05:36 - basically 1 in it is equal to 96 pixels
05:39 - over here which is equal to 2.54 CM so
05:42 - guys let us check this as well so
05:44 - basically I'm going to copy this line of
05:46 - code over here and simply we are going
05:48 - to have the class name as in in which is
05:51 - inches in this case and then let us say
05:53 - we have this text test this font size is
05:55 - in inches let me just save this file now
05:58 - and over here we are going to to copy
06:00 - this line of code for the class inches
06:03 - and let us change this class name to
06:05 - iron in this case and let us have some
06:07 - unit in terms of inches over here now
06:10 - guys what is 1 in it is equal to 96
06:12 - pixels but it will be a very big font
06:15 - size so let's say we want 0.2 in in this
06:18 - case which will be approximately 19
06:20 - pixels over here so guys let us have 0.2
06:24 - in in this case so ion is the unit that
06:26 - you can use when you want to provide the
06:29 - font size in terms of inches so guys let
06:31 - me just save this file now and try
06:33 - reloading this page once again on the
06:35 - browser so as you can see this font size
06:37 - is in inches and it is 0.2 in right now
06:41 - so when we inspect over here it says it
06:43 - is 0.2 in and if we calculate how many
06:46 - inches it will be so we multiply 96
06:49 - pixels by 0.2 in over here so basically
06:52 - it is 19.2 pixels in this case so guys
06:55 - if we provide 19.2 pixels as the size
06:58 - over here that is the font size for this
07:00 - paragraph there will be no change in
07:02 - this case so when we provide 19.2 pixels
07:05 - let me just save this file now and try
07:07 - reloading this page you will notice that
07:09 - there will be no change for the font
07:10 - size of this particular paragraph tag
07:12 - over here so when we reload so as you
07:15 - can see there is no change in this
07:16 - particular paragraphs font size and it
07:19 - is set in terms of pixels over here so
07:21 - guys basically this is the conversion
07:23 - that you can use that is 1 in it is
07:25 - equal to 96 pixels based on your project
07:28 - requirements and then guys apart from
07:30 - this we can also use the pixels unit
07:32 - which we were using till now so
07:34 - basically let us use that as well so
07:36 - over here what we will do is we will
07:38 - roll back this change to 0.2 in in this
07:41 - case and then guys apart from this let
07:42 - us have another paragraph over here in
07:45 - which case the class will be PX which
07:47 - represents the pixels length in this
07:49 - case so basically we are going to say
07:52 - the font size is in pixels for this
07:54 - paragraph so let me just save this file
07:56 - now and over here inside the style. CSS
07:59 - file let us have the entry for the
08:01 - pixels class so we have PX in this case
08:04 - and let's say we have the 24 pixel size
08:07 - for this particular font size over here
08:09 - so guys let me just save this file now
08:11 - and try reloading this page once again
08:13 - on the browser so as you can see this
08:15 - font size is in pixels over here and
08:17 - then when we inspect this particular
08:19 - paragraph you can see that we have the
08:21 - 24 pixels font size we can increase or
08:24 - decrease this font size so let us say we
08:26 - provide the 28 pixels and you can see
08:28 - that the size of this particular
08:30 - paragraph is increased now so guys in
08:32 - this way you can use the pixels length
08:34 - unit as well and apart from this we also
08:37 - have the PT which represents the point's
08:39 - length over here and then we also have
08:41 - PC which is P's length over here now one
08:44 - point it is equal to 1x 72 of 1 in and 1
08:48 - PC is equal to 12 points over here so
08:51 - guys both these length units I leave up
08:53 - to you as a homework for you so that you
08:55 - can practice on your own on different
08:57 - HTML elements and understand it in a
09:00 - more clear way now guys apart from this
09:02 - we also have certain relative lens as
09:04 - well so far we have seen what are the
09:06 - absolute lens which means these numbers
09:08 - will be directly applied to those HTML
09:11 - elements now guys what is the meaning of
09:13 - relative lens over here so basically the
09:15 - relative length units specify a length
09:18 - relative to another length property and
09:21 - the relative length units scale better
09:23 - between different rendering mediums so
09:26 - guys let us check this with the help of
09:27 - examples now the first relative length
09:30 - unit is em over here now guys it is
09:32 - relative to the font size of the element
09:35 - and 2 em means 2 * the size of the
09:38 - current font over here so guys let us
09:40 - check this with the help of example in
09:42 - vs code so what we are going to do is
09:44 - let us copy this line of code over here
09:47 - and simply what we are going to do is
09:49 - for this paragraph We are going to say
09:50 - the class name is em and then we will
09:53 - say this font size is in EM over here
09:56 - now guys as we know the default font
09:58 - size for all almost all the browsers is
10:01 - 16 pixels over here so when we say 1 em
10:04 - it will be equal to 16 pixels so let us
10:07 - check that as well let me just save this
10:09 - HTML file and move to the CSS file over
10:12 - here and simply we are going to have the
10:14 - entry for the class name that is em so
10:16 - we have do em in this case and then guys
10:19 - for the font what we will do is we will
10:21 - set it as 1 em in this case let me just
10:24 - save this file now and try reloading
10:26 - this page once again on the browser so
10:28 - as you can see this for font size is in
10:30 - EM now guys if we inspect this
10:32 - particular option over here when we
10:34 - inspect this particular paragraph you
10:36 - can see that the font size is equal to 1
10:38 - em over here so when we uncheck this as
10:41 - you can see the font size is not
10:43 - changing that's because the default font
10:45 - size for this particular browser is 16
10:48 - pixels and that is what is getting
10:50 - applied over here when we uncheck this
10:52 - option and when we check this option it
10:54 - is set to 1 em and 1 em is also equal to
10:58 - 16 pixels so guys what we will do is
11:00 - let's say we want to change it to 2 em
11:03 - over here so what will happen so since 1
11:05 - em is 16 pixels 2 * em will be equal to
11:09 - 32 pixels which can be calculated by 2 *
11:13 - by 16 so guys over here the font size
11:15 - will be increased to 32 pixels in this
11:18 - case so let me just save this file now
11:20 - and try reloading this page once again
11:22 - on the browser so as you can see this is
11:24 - equal to 32 pixels right now when we
11:26 - uncheck this option it will go back to
11:28 - 60 pixels once again because we have not
11:31 - provided any font size but when we
11:33 - provide the font size of 2 em so it will
11:35 - change to 32 pixels and guys over here
11:38 - the decimal numbers also work so let's
11:40 - say we want to provide 1.5 em in this
11:43 - case so instead of 2 em let's say we
11:46 - provide 1.5 em over here let me just
11:48 - save this file now and try reloading
11:50 - this page once again on the browser so
11:52 - now the font size is equal to 24 pixels
11:55 - which is equal to 1.5 em over here so
11:58 - guys in this way you you can use the EM
12:00 - length unit which is a relative length
12:02 - unit in this case where 1 em is equal to
12:05 - 16 pixels of the font size now guys
12:08 - apart from this we also have something
12:10 - called as R which is relative to the
12:13 - font size of the root element so guys
12:15 - what is the meaning of root element so
12:17 - over here for the HTML document we have
12:20 - the root tag as the HTML tag over here
12:23 - which is this particular tag so guys
12:25 - whatever font size of this HTML tag is
12:28 - basically based on that font size the RM
12:32 - unit will work so let us check that as
12:34 - well so in this case we are going to
12:36 - have the paragraph tag with the class
12:38 - name that is RM and then we will say
12:40 - this font size is in RM over here let me
12:43 - just save this file now and go to the
12:45 - style. CSS file in this case and then
12:48 - guys what we will do is we will also
12:49 - have the HTML tag in this case and
12:52 - inside this we are going to say font
12:54 - size and by default let's say we have
12:56 - the font size as 16 pixels so we are
12:58 - going to set the 16 pixels as the value
13:01 - for the font size inside the HTML tag
13:04 - now guys we will have the RM entry over
13:07 - here so basically we are going to have
13:09 - dot followed by the class name that is r
13:12 - and let's say we have one RM as the
13:15 - length unit so guys basically for the
13:17 - paragraph which is having the class that
13:19 - is RM over here the font size will be
13:21 - equal to 1 RM which means it will be
13:24 - equal to 1 multiplied by the font size
13:27 - of the root element that is 16 pixels so
13:29 - basically it will be equal to 16 pixels
13:32 - in this case let me just save this file
13:34 - now and try reloading this page once
13:36 - again on the browser so as you can see
13:38 - the font size is an RM and basically
13:40 - this font size is 16 pixels over here
13:43 - and the moment we change this font size
13:45 - let's say to 20 pixels in this case for
13:48 - the root element which is HTML element
13:50 - over here the font size for this
13:52 - paragraph will also increase so guys let
13:55 - me just save this file now and try
13:57 - reloading this page once again on the
13:59 - browser notice that the font size for
14:01 - this particular paragraph will increase
14:03 - now so when we reload this page as you
14:05 - can see the font size for this paragraph
14:08 - has increased over here so guys in this
14:10 - way you can use the RM unit over here
14:13 - apart from this you can also increase
14:14 - the RM unit so let's say we increase
14:17 - this unit to 1.5 over here let me just
14:20 - save this file now and this time it
14:22 - should be equal to 30 pixels because the
14:25 - HTML font size is 20 pixels right now so
14:28 - when we reload this page once again you
14:30 - will notice that this particular font
14:32 - size will increase so when we reload
14:34 - this page so as you can see the font
14:36 - size has now increased to 30 pixels this
14:39 - time so guys in this way you can use the
14:41 - RM unit as well now guys apart from this
14:43 - we also have two more important relative
14:46 - units that is VW which is relative to 1%
14:50 - of the width of the viewport and VH
14:52 - which is relative to the 1% of the
14:55 - height of the viewport so guys over here
14:57 - W stands for width and X stands for
14:59 - height and V is nothing but it is the
15:02 - viewport now guys what is viewport over
15:04 - here so basically viewport is nothing
15:06 - but the visible area that you can see on
15:08 - this particular browser so since we have
15:11 - opened console over here by using the
15:13 - F12 option on windows so basically this
15:16 - is the viewport you can see that we can
15:18 - increase or decrease the width of the
15:20 - viewport and the same number can be
15:22 - displayed over here that what is the
15:24 - width of this particular screen right
15:26 - now so when we increase the width let's
15:29 - say this is 688 pixels over here so
15:32 - right now you can see it is 688 pixels
15:35 - so what we are going to do is let us
15:37 - create another paragraph tag in this
15:39 - case so guys over here what we will do
15:41 - is inside the HTML file we will have
15:43 - another paragraph tag over here and
15:45 - simply we are going to have the class
15:47 - name as VW and then we will say this
15:50 - width is in VW so guys we are going to
15:52 - set the width property over here for
15:54 - this particular paragraph So this width
15:57 - is in VW unit so guys let me just save
16:00 - this file now and inside the style. CSS
16:03 - file again we are going to have the
16:05 - entry for this VW class so guys over
16:08 - here we have dot followed by VW and this
16:11 - time let us have the background color
16:13 - for this paragraph tag so that we can
16:15 - identify that what is the width of this
16:18 - particular paragraph So guys over here
16:20 - we have the background color as yellow
16:22 - and then what we will do is we are going
16:24 - to set the width in this case so guys
16:26 - basically as we have seen that we VW is
16:29 - nothing but it is 1% of the width of the
16:32 - viewport so guys when we say 1 VW it is
16:35 - 1% but let's say we want the 50% of this
16:38 - particular view Port so basically it is
16:41 - 688 pixels of width that we have seen
16:44 - just now so what we can do is 50% of the
16:47 - VW unit will be equal to 344 pixels so
16:50 - the same withd we are going to set so
16:53 - guys basically we are going to set 50
16:55 - length and then the unit that we are
16:57 - going to use is VW over here so let me
17:00 - just save this file now and try
17:01 - reloading this page once again on the
17:03 - browser so as you can see we have this
17:05 - paragraph which is having this width is
17:07 - in VW unit text over here and we have
17:10 - the background color as yellow and it is
17:12 - taking 50% of the width over here as far
17:15 - as this viewport is concerned guys what
17:17 - we are going to do is we will just
17:19 - comment out the previous paragraphs over
17:21 - here so that we can understand the VW
17:24 - and VH units more clearly so we have
17:27 - commented out the previous paragraph
17:29 - over here let me just save this file now
17:30 - and try reloading this page so as you
17:32 - can see we are only seeing this
17:34 - particular paragraph over here now guys
17:36 - if we increase or decrease the width
17:38 - basically the width of this paragraph
17:40 - that is having the background color as
17:42 - yellow will also increase or decrease so
17:45 - when we decrease the width you can see
17:47 - that the width of the paragraph is also
17:49 - decreasing that's because the viewport
17:51 - width is decreasing over here and
17:53 - accordingly we are setting the 50% of
17:56 - this particular viewport as the width of
17:59 - the paragraph and that is why the width
18:01 - of the paragraph is also decreasing in
18:03 - this case and when we increase the width
18:05 - of the viewport the width of the
18:07 - paragraph is increasing over here and
18:09 - let's say we set it to 600 pixels over
18:12 - here as the width so basically now the
18:14 - width of this paragraph is 300 pixels so
18:17 - guys let us check that as well so
18:19 - instead of having 50 VW let us comment
18:22 - out this line of code over here and we
18:24 - are going to set the withd once again
18:26 - and this time we are going to set the
18:28 - with S3 300 pixels over here that's
18:30 - because the viewport width is 600 pixels
18:33 - let me just save this file now and try
18:35 - reloading this page once again on the
18:37 - browser you will notice that there will
18:38 - be no change right now over here so when
18:41 - we reload this page as you can see there
18:43 - is no change right now over here and
18:45 - when we remove this line of code let us
18:47 - comment out this line of code and let us
18:49 - uncomment the line of code having the
18:52 - viewport withd that is the VW unit over
18:55 - here let me just save this file now it
18:56 - is same as 300 pixels so there will be
18:59 - no change so when we reload this page as
19:01 - you can see there is no change over here
19:03 - and now let us decrease the width of
19:05 - this particular paragraph so let us set
19:07 - it to 40 VW so let me just save this
19:11 - file now and try reloading this page
19:13 - once again on the browser so as you can
19:14 - see the width has been decreased now and
19:17 - based on the viewport over here it
19:20 - decrease or increase in this case now
19:22 - guys we can also see that the height is
19:25 - 4467 over here so what we can do is we
19:28 - can use
20:28 - particular device on which the user is
