00:00 - so now we will see input type date time
00:02 - local in HTML form so guys basically the
00:05 - input tag along with the type attribute
00:07 - that is date time local will help us to
00:10 - specify the date along with the time as
00:13 - well as the input field with no time
00:15 - zone so basically whatever time is being
00:17 - selected by the user it will be the
00:19 - local time for that particular user over
00:22 - here now guys it depends on the browser
00:24 - support so you need to test this
00:26 - particular input tag on the different
00:28 - browsers in order to check whether some
00:30 - of the older browsers are still showing
00:32 - the input type with the date time picker
00:35 - or not so guys some of the older
00:37 - browsers might not support this
00:38 - particular type attribute but majority
00:41 - of the latest browsers will be able to
00:43 - show this date time picker so let us
00:46 - check this with the help of examples in
00:47 - vs code over here so basically
00:49 - previously we had seen how we can use
00:51 - the Color Picker by using the type that
00:54 - is color and also we have seen the date
00:56 - picker by using the type that is date
00:59 - this time we we will be using the type
01:01 - that is date time local over here so
01:03 - again we will be defining the input
01:05 - followed by colon and this time we will
01:07 - be using this date time local over here
01:11 - so when we select this as you can see
01:13 - the type attribute is being selected as
01:15 - the date time local in this case and
01:17 - then for the name attribute we will set
01:20 - it as date time over here so guys this
01:22 - is the name attribute and for the ID
01:25 - attribute as well we will set the string
01:27 - that is date time in this case and
01:29 - before this in we will also set the
01:31 - label as well so that the user is able
01:34 - to select the date as well as the time
01:36 - from this particular date time picker
01:38 - now guys for the for attribute we will
01:40 - set the ID of this datetime picker as
01:43 - the for attribute in this case so I'll
01:45 - simply paste this date time string and
01:48 - then we will say select date time over
01:51 - here so we have select date time
01:53 - followed by colon and then guys after
01:55 - this input tag we will also have the
01:57 - couple of line breaks so that the next
01:59 - button that is having the value click me
02:02 - will be displayed on the other line now
02:04 - let me just save this file now and try
02:06 - reloading this page once again on the
02:08 - browser so as you can see we have select
02:10 - a date time as the label and Then
02:12 - followed by the date time picker over
02:14 - here now guys we are having the date
02:16 - along with that we are also having the
02:18 - time picker as well so as you can see we
02:21 - can select the time as well along with
02:23 - the date and the difference between the
02:25 - date and the date time local type is
02:27 - that for the simple date picker we can
02:29 - only select one of the dates over here
02:31 - but for the date time picker we can also
02:33 - select the time in this case so guys
02:36 - this is the basic difference between the
02:38 - type attribute that is date and the type
02:40 - attribute that is date time local over
02:42 - here so in case you have the requirement
02:44 - of setting the time as well you can use
02:47 - the date time local in this case so we
02:49 - can select one of the dates in this case
02:51 - so let's say we select 15th of December
02:53 - 2023 and the time is 18 over here so 18
02:57 - 0 0 so guys in this case we are setting
03:00 - the date as well as the time over here
03:02 - as you can see now guys let us say when
03:04 - we click on this button that is Click me
03:06 - we want to see the date as well as the
03:08 - time in the alert box so what we have to
03:11 - do is already we had return the code
03:13 - over here that is having the on click
03:15 - attribute for this button that is Click
03:17 - me we are calling the test function that
03:20 - is already written in the JavaScript so
03:22 - guys this is a very basic function that
03:24 - we have return over here what we are
03:26 - doing is we will be getting the value of
03:28 - the datetime Picker and we will show
03:30 - that value inside the alert function so
03:33 - we simply have to set the ID that is
03:35 - date time over here and then we have to
03:37 - provide the alert that is date time is
03:40 - and Then followed by the variable in
03:42 - which the date time is being selected in
03:44 - this case so guys let me just save this
03:46 - file now and try reloading this page
03:48 - once again on the browser I'll select
03:50 - the date as 10th of December 2023 and
03:53 - then let's say the time is 1805 over
03:56 - here so when we set this 1805 in this
03:59 - case you can see that the date and time
04:01 - is being selected over here and when we
04:03 - click on this button that is Click me as
04:05 - you can see we are getting the ear that
04:07 - is 2023 followed by the month that is 12
04:10 - and Then followed by the date that is 10
04:13 - and then guys we have this character
04:14 - that is T which is separating the date
04:16 - as well as the time and then after this
04:19 - character we have the time that is 18
04:21 - which is the r and the 05 which is the
04:24 - minute in this case so guys in this way
04:26 - you can easily select the date time by
04:28 - using this date time picker over here
04:30 - let me change the timing in this case so
04:32 - we set the time is 2016 over here and
04:35 - then let's say we select the date as
04:37 - 20th of December so guys we have 20
04:39 - December 2023 and then the time is 2016
04:43 - so when we click on this button that is
04:45 - Click me over here you can see that we
04:47 - have the 20th December 2023 date as well
04:50 - as the time that is set as 2016 over
04:53 - here as the alert so guys in this way
04:55 - you can easily use the datetime Picker
