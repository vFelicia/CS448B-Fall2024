00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to display the powers of
00:06 - the number that is 2 using the anonymous
00:08 - function and the map function so guys
00:10 - previously we had seen how we can get
00:12 - the powers of 2 using the for Loop in
00:14 - the previous Python program so guys by
00:17 - just using one line of code over here
00:19 - inside the for Loop we can easily get
00:21 - the powers of 2 but guys in this program
00:23 - we are going to check how we can use the
00:25 - map function along with the anonymous
00:27 - function as well in order to achieve the
00:30 - same task so over here in the vs code
00:32 - what we will be doing is I'll just clear
00:34 - these lines of code and then guys we are
00:36 - going to use the map function over here
00:38 - so as you can see this is the map
00:39 - function it takes two parameters the
00:42 - first parameter is the function itself
00:44 - so guys over here I will say the name of
00:46 - the function that is power over here and
00:48 - then the second parameter it can be the
00:51 - list so basically we are going to have
00:53 - the list of numbers in order to find the
00:55 - Power of 2 so we will Define the list
00:57 - over here let's say we have four numbers
00:59 - that is 1 2 3 and then 4 so guys we are
01:02 - going to find only four powers over here
01:04 - that is 2 raised to 1 then 2 raised to 2
01:06 - 2 raised to 3 and 2 raised to 4. so guys
01:09 - the second parameter is nothing but it
01:11 - is the iterable over here and the first
01:13 - parameter in this case is the function
01:15 - that we want to execute so basically we
01:18 - are going to Define this function so we
01:20 - are going to use the TEF keyword
01:22 - followed by the power function over here
01:24 - and this function it will take one
01:26 - number at a time the first number will
01:28 - be one so this number will be taken over
01:30 - here and it will be passed to this
01:31 - function that is power so over here we
01:34 - will take the number as I and then
01:36 - inside this what we will be doing is we
01:38 - will simply return 2 raised to I so over
01:41 - here 2 and then 2 times multiplication
01:43 - and then I over here so guys basically
01:46 - we are doing 2 raised to 1 for the very
01:48 - first instance over here and then we are
01:50 - getting 2 raised to 2 2 raised to 3 2
01:52 - raised to 4 so 1 at a time this power
01:55 - function will be called by using this
01:57 - map function over here now guys we are
01:58 - going to store this result inside
02:00 - another variable so over here we will
02:03 - simply say map underscore result and
02:06 - then equal to so guys what is happening
02:08 - behind the scenes is one number is being
02:10 - taken at a time and then this power
02:12 - function is being called and one at a
02:15 - time these parameters are being passed
02:17 - to this power function and then we are
02:19 - getting the result and getting it stored
02:21 - in the map result now guys we can simply
02:23 - print this map result by converting it
02:25 - into the list so over here what we will
02:28 - do is we will have the print statement
02:30 - and then we will have the list function
02:32 - over here inside this list function we
02:35 - can simply provide the map result over
02:37 - here so we'll provide map result so the
02:40 - result that we should be expecting is 2
02:41 - raised to 1 that is equal to 2 and 2
02:44 - raised to 2 it is 4 then 2 raised to 3
02:46 - is 8 and 2 raised to 4 is 16 all the
02:48 - numbers should be present inside this
02:50 - list over here which is going to be
02:52 - printed so let me just save this file
02:53 - now and try running this code so as you
02:55 - can see we are getting this list that is
02:57 - 2 4 8 and then 16. so guys this is the
02:59 - the way that we can easily use the map
03:01 - function in order to find the Power of
03:04 - 2. Now guys we have also said that we
03:06 - are going to write the anonymous
03:08 - function so instead of this power
03:10 - function what we can do is we can simply
03:12 - remove this power function and we can
03:14 - Define the anonymous function that is
03:17 - Lambda it is going to take one parameter
03:19 - which we will name it as I over here and
03:21 - then colon and then we have to provide
03:23 - the same expression that we have
03:24 - provided over here in the return
03:26 - statement so I'll just copy this and
03:28 - paste this over here so guys now we have
03:30 - got rid of the power function we can
03:32 - remove this definition of the power as
03:34 - well and with the help of the map
03:36 - function and the anonymous function
03:38 - inside the map function we are achieving
03:40 - the same task over here let me just run
03:43 - this code once again I'll just enter
03:45 - another number that is 5 so 2 raised to
03:47 - 5 will be also computed and will be
03:49 - stored in the map result which will be
03:51 - printed again so let me save this file
03:53 - now and try running this code as you can
03:55 - see we are getting 2 4 8 16 and then 32
03:58 - so guys this is the way that we can find
04:00 - the Power of 2 over here using the map
04:03 - and the anonymous function over here we
04:05 - can have some more labels as well we can
04:07 - say power of 2 and then colon and then
04:11 - we can have the list of this map result
04:13 - so basically what we will be having is
04:15 - the label over here that is power of 2
04:17 - and then the list of all the elements
04:19 - for which we have already found the
04:21 - power of 2 guys can we have the range
04:23 - function over here instead of this list
04:25 - let us try that so when we provide range
04:28 - over here so this is the range function
04:31 - and then inside this range let's say we
04:33 - provide the number 10 so it will go from
04:35 - 0 up to 9 so let me just save this file
04:37 - now and try running this code so as you
04:39 - can see yes we can provide the range
04:41 - function as well it is going from 0 that
04:43 - is 2 raised to 0 is 1 and then 2 raised
04:45 - to 1 is 2 then we have 4 8 16 32 64 128
04:50 - 256 and then 512 so guys basically it is
04:54 - going from 2 raised to 0 up to 2 raised
04:56 - to 9 in this case so guys this is the
04:58 - way that we can easily use the the
05:00 - combination of the map function along
05:02 - with the anonymous function in order to
05:04 - find the Power of 2 apart from finding
05:06 - the power of 2 we can have any other
05:08 - expression over here based on your
05:10 - requirements so guys practice on your
05:12 - own so that on different inputs you get
05:14 - different outputs please make sure that
05:16 - you like this video so that it reaches
